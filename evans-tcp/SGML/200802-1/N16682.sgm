<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AN earne&s;t de&s;ire of improving this Selection as much as po&s;&s;ible, has engaged the Compiler to make con&s;iderable alterations upon it in every &s;ucceeding im|pre&s;&s;ion; and in none more than the pre&s;ent. For the&s;e liberties he hopes to be forgiven; e&s;pecially as they have been the means of giving it at la&s;t a degree of excellence, which, he flatters him&s;elf, will render it highly acceptable to every per&s;on of ta&s;te. To prevent, however, the inconveniences which might attend the varying of it &s;o much in future editions, it is determined to allow it, henceforward, to remain the &s;ame, or nearly the &s;ame, as it is now pre&s;ented to the Public.&mdash;Of the general plan and manner of u&s;ing it, the following is a &s;hort account.</P>
<P>PART I. is calculated to form the accurate and poli&s;h|ed Reader. It is divided into eight &s;ections; five in Pro&s;e, and three in Ver&s;e. For &s;everal rea&s;ons, it was thought proper to pre&s;erve the poetical pieces entirely di&s;tinct from the pro&s;aic; but, in teaching, it will, ge|nerally, be preferable to take the &s;ections in the order&mdash; One, Two, Three, Six, Four, Seven, Five, Eight: by which method, the learner will be well exerci&s;ed in the reading of Pro&s;e before entering upon that of Ver&s;e; and will, afterwards, read a &s;ection of the latter kind and one of the former alternately, till this Part be fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>PART II. may be read with no le&s;s propriety than the preceding, by pupils of every denomination; but is particularly adapted for &s;uch as may have occa&s;ion to &s;peak in public. This part is divided into five &s;ections; the fir&s;t three, exhibiting &s;pecimens of eloquence &s;uited re&s;pectively, to the Pulpit, the Senate, and the Bar; the fourth, Speeches delivered on various occa&s;ions; the fifth, Dramatic pieces. The&s;e may be gone re|gularly through by every &s;tudent; though, where a particular &s;pecies of delivery is in view, one &s;ection will de&s;erve to be longer dwelt upon than another, as is
<PB N="vi" REF="021451_0003_0FB3F605208662B0">
manife&s;t from their titles.&mdash;It need hardly be ob&s;erved, that frequent reading in a &s;tanding po&s;ture, and recita|tation without book, are e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary in form|ing the Public Speaker, and extremely proper for youth in general.</P>
<P>IN the Appendix is given a cour&s;e of Le&s;&s;ons on an original plan, by which the Compiler has long taught with uncommon &s;ucce&s;s. In particular ca&s;es, the&s;e may be read wholly through, as an introduction to pieces of greater length and of a more mixed nature; but, in general, it will an&s;wer better to make a few of them a part of each day's reading, repeating them in the &s;ame manner as often as may be thought nece&s;&s;ary. As they exemplify particulars which enter into, and form almo&s;t the whole of compo&s;ition, it is evident the &s;tudy of them mu&s;t be highly advantageous.</P>
<P>By ca&s;ting the eye along the table of contents, the variety and merit of the pieces contained in this volume will appear in a &s;triking light. Almo&s;t every emotion of the &s;oul, and every mode of expre&s;&s;ion, will here be called forth into exerci&s;e; while, at the &s;ame time, the pupil will be made acquainted with the be&s;t authors, and, by the frequent peru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al of &s;o many of their princi|pal beauties, acquire a t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;te for correct and elegant wri|ting. As a further recommendation of the work, no|thing will be found in it which can in the &s;malle&s;t de|gree be offen&s;ive to delicacy or hurtful to moral: on the contrary, every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;on will be found to be either in|nocently entertaining or agreeably in&s;tructive.</P>

<P>MAN's chief good is an upright mind; which no earthly power can be&s;tow, nor take from him.</P>
<P>We ought to di&s;tru&s;t our pa&s;&s;ions, even when they ap|pear the mo&s;t rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>It is idle, as well as ab&s;urd, to impo&s;e our opinions upon others. The &s;ame ground of conviction operates differently on the &s;ame man in different circum&s;tances, and on different men in the &s;ame circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Choo&s;e what is mo&s;t fit; cu&s;tom will make it the mo&s;t agreeable.</P>
<P>A cheerful countenance betokens an good heart.</P>
<P>Hypocri&s;y is an homage that vice pays to virtue.</P>
<P>Anxiety and con&s;traint are the con&s;tant attendants of pride.</P>
<P>Men make them&s;elves ridiculous, not &s;o much by the qualities they have, as by the affectation of tho&s;e they have not.</P>
<P>Nothing blunts the edge of ridicule &s;o effectually as good humor.</P>
<P>To &s;ay little and perform much, is the characteri&s;tic of a great mind.</P>
<P>A man who gives his children a habit of indu&s;try, provides for them better than by giving them a &s;tock of money.</P>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>OUR good or bad fortune depends greatly on the choice we make of our friends.</P>
<P>The young are &s;laves to novelty, the old to cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>No preacher is &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as time. It gives a turn of thought to the aged, which it was impo&s;&s;ible to in&s;pire while they were young.</P>
<P>Every man, however little, makes a figure in his own eyes.</P>
<P>Self-partiality hides from us tho&s;e very faults in our|&s;elves which we &s;ee and blame in others.</P>
<P>The injuries we do, and tho&s;e we &s;uffer are &s;eldom weighed in the &s;ame balance.</P>
<P>Men generally put a greater value upon the favors they be&s;tow, than upon tho&s;e they receive.</P>
<P>He who is puffed up with the fir&s;t gale of pro&s;perity, will bend beneath the fir&s;t bla&s;t of adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>Adver&s;ity borrows its &s;harpe&s;t &s;ting from our impa|tience.</P>
<P>Men commonly owe their virtue or their vice to edu|cation as much as to nature.</P>
<P>There is no &s;uch fop as my young ma&s;ter of his lady-mother's making. She blows him up with &s;elf-conceit, and there he &s;tops. She makes a man of him at twelve, and a boy all his life after.</P>
<P>An infallible way to make your child mi&s;erable, is to &s;atisfy all his demands. Pa&s;&s;ion &s;wells by gratification; and the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;atisfying every one of his de|mands, will oblige you to &s;top &s;hort at la&s;t, after he has become head&s;trong.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>WE e&s;teem mo&s;t things according to their intrin&s;ic merit: it is &s;trange MAN &s;hould be an exception. We prize a hor&s;e for his &s;trength and courage, not for his fur|niture.

<HEAD>XVI. DIONYSIUS AND DAMOCLES.</HEAD>
<P>DIONYSIUS, the tyrant of Sicily, &s;howed how far he was from being happy, even whil&s;t he abounded in riches, and all the plea&s;ures which riches can procure. Damocles, one of his flatterers, was complimenting him upon his power, his trea&s;ures, and the magnificence of his royal &s;tate, and affirming that no monarch ever was greater or happier than he. "Have you a mind, Da|mocles," &s;ays the king, "to ta&s;te this happine&s;s, and know by experience what my enjoyments are, of which you have &s;o high an idea?" Damocles gladly accepted the offer. Upon which the king ordered, that a royal banquet &s;hould be prepared, and a gilded couch placed for him, covered with rich embroidery, and &s;ide-boards loaded with gold and &s;ilver plate of immen&s;e value. Pa|ges of extraordinary beauty were ordered to wait on him at table, and to obey his commands with the great|e&s;t readine&s;s and the mo&s;t profound &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Neither ointments, chaplets of flowers, nor rich perfumes were wanting. The table was loaded with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite delicacies of every kind. Damocles fancied him&s;elf a|mong&s;t the gods. In the mid&s;t of all his happine&s;s, he &s;ees let down from the roof, exactly over his neck, as he lay indulging him&s;elf in &s;tate, a glittering &s;word hung by a &s;ingle hair. The &s;ight of de&s;truction thus threatening him from on high, &s;oon put a &s;top to his joy and revelling. The pomp of his attendance, and the glitter of the carved plate, gave him no longer any plea&s;ure. He dreads to &s;tretch forth his hand to the table; he throws off the chaplet of ro&s;es; he ha&s;tens to remove from his dangerous &s;ituation; and at la&s;t begs the king to re&s;tore him to his former humble condition, having no de&s;ire to enjoy any longer &s;uch a dreadful kind of happine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>XVII. CHARACTER OF CATILINE.</HEAD>
<P>LUCIUS CATILINE, by birth a Patrician, was by na|ture endowed with &s;uperior advantages both bodily and mental; but his di&s;po&s;itions were corrupt and wick|ed. From his youth, his &s;upreme delight was in vio|lence, &s;laughter, rapine, and inte&s;tine confu&s;ions; and &s;uch works were the employment of his earlie&s;t years. His con&s;titution qualified him for bearing hunger, cold, and want of &s;leep, to a degree exceeding belief. His mind was daring, &s;ubtle, un&s;teady. There was no cha|racter which he could not a&s;&s;ume and put off at plea|&s;ure. Rapacious of what belonged to others, prodigal of his own, violently bent on whatever became the ob|ject of his pur&s;uit. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable &s;hare of eloquence, but little &s;olid knowledge. His in&s;atiable temper was ever pu&s;hing him to gra&s;p at what was im|moderate, romantic, and out of his reach.</P>
<P>About the time of the di&s;turbances rai&s;ed by Sylla, Catiline was &s;eized with a violent lu&s;t of power; nor did he at all he&s;itate about the means, &s;o he could but at|tain his purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing him&s;elf to &s;upreme dominion. His re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit was in a continual ferment, occa&s;ion|ed by the confu&s;ion of his own private affairs, and by the horrors of his guilty con&s;cience; both which he had brought upon him&s;elf by living the life above de&s;cribed. He was encouraged in his ambitious projects by the ge|neral corruption of manners which then prevailed a|mong&s;t a people infected with two vices, not le&s;s oppo|&s;ite to one another in their natures than mi&s;chievous in their tendencies; I mean, Luxury and Avarice.</P>

<HEAD>XVIII. AVARICE AND LUXURY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE were two very powerful tyrants engaged in a perpetual war again&s;t each other: the name of the fir&s;t was Luxury, and of the &s;econd Avarice. The aim of each of them was no le&s;s than univer&s;al monarchy over the hearts of mankind. Luxury had many gen|erals under him, who did him great &s;ervice; as Plea|&s;ure, Mirth, Pomp, and Fa&s;hion. Avarice was like|wi&s;e very &s;trong in his officers, being faithfully &s;erved by Hunger, Indu&s;try, Care, and Watchfulne&s;s: he had
<PB N="27" REF="021451_0026_0FB3F6291F8C4370">
likewi&s;e a privy-coun&s;ellor who was always at his elbow, and whi&s;pering &s;omething or other in his ear: the name of this privy-coun&s;ellor was Poverty. As Avarice con|ducted him&s;elf by the coun&s;els of Poverty, his antago|ni&s;t was entirely guided by the dictates and advice of Plenty, who was his fir&s;t coun&s;ellor and mini&s;ter of &s;tate, that concerted all his mea&s;ures for him, and ne|ver departed out of his &s;ight. While the&s;e two great rivals were thus contending for empire, their conque&s;ts were very various. Luxury got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one heart, and Avarice of another. The father of a family would often range him&s;elf under the banners of Avarice, and the &s;on under tho&s;e of Luxury. The wife and hu&s;band would often declare them&s;elves on the two different parties; nay, the &s;ame per&s;on would very often &s;ide with one in his youth, and revolt to the other in his old age. Indeed the wi&s;e men of the world &s;tood neuter; but, alas! their numbers were not con&s;iderable. At length, when the&s;e two potentates had wearied them|&s;elves with waging war upon one another, they agreed upon an interview, at which neither of their coun&s;ellors were to be pre&s;ent. It is &s;aid that Luxury began the parley; and, after having repre&s;ented the endle&s;s &s;tate of war in which they were engaged, told his enemy, with a frankne&s;s of heart which is natural to him, that he believed they two &s;hould be very good friends, were it not for the in&s;tigations of Poverty, that pernicious coun&s;ellor, who made an ill u&s;e of his ear, and filled him with groundle&s;s apprehen&s;ions and prejudices. To this Avarice replied, that he looked upon Plenty (the fir&s;t mini&s;ter of his antagoni&s;t) to be a much more de&s;tructive coun&s;ellor than Poverty; for that he was perpetually &s;ugge&s;ting plea&s;ures, bani&s;hing all the nece&s;&s;ary cautions again&s;t want, and, con&s;equently, undermining tho&s;e principles on which the government of Avarice was founded. At la&s;t, in order to an accommodation, they a|greed upon this preliminary; that each of them &s;hould immediately di&s;mi&s;s his privy-coun&s;ellor. When things were thus far adju&s;ted towards a peace, all other dif|ferences were &s;oon accommodated; in&s;omuch that for the future they re&s;olved to live as good friends and con|federates, and to &s;hare between them whatever con|que&s;ts
<PB N="28" REF="021451_0027_0FB3F62B1A5E8CA0">
were made on either &s;ide. For this rea&s;on, we now find Luxury and Avarice taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame heart, and dividing the &s;ame per&s;on between them. To which I &s;hall only add, that &s;ince the di&s;|carding of the coun&s;ellors above mentioned, Avarice &s;upplies Luxury in the room of Plenty, as Luxury prompts Avarice in the place of Poverty.</P>

<HEAD>XIX. HERCULES's CHOICE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Hercules was in that part of his youth in which it was natural for him to con&s;ider what cour&s;e of life he ought to pur&s;ue, he one day retired into a de&s;ert, where the &s;ilence and &s;olitude of the place very much favored his meditations. As he was mu&s;ing on his pre&s;ent condition, and very much perplexed in him&s;elf on the &s;tate of life he &s;hould choo&s;e, he &s;aw two women of a larger &s;tature than ordinary approaching towards him. One of them had a very noble air and graceful deportment; her beauty was natural and ea&s;y, her per&s;on clean and un&s;potted, her eyes ca&s;t towards the ground with an agreeable re&s;erve, her motion and behavior full of mode&s;ty, and her raiment as white as &s;now. The other had a great deal of health and flo|ridne&s;s in her countenance, which &s;he had helped with an artificial white and red; and &s;he endeavored to appear more graceful than ordinary in her mien, by a mixture of affectation in all her ge&s;tures. She had a wonderful confidence and a&s;&s;urance in her looks, and all the variety of colours in her dre&s;s that &s;he thought were the mo&s;t proper to &s;hew her complexion to ad|vantage. She ca&s;t her eyes upon her&s;elf, then turned them on tho&s;e that were pre&s;ent, to &s;ee how they liked her; and often looked on the figure &s;he made in her own &s;hadow. Upon her nearer approach to Hercules, &s;he &s;tepped before the other lady, who came forward with a regular compo&s;ed carriage; and, running up to him, acco&s;ted him after the following manner:</P>
<P>"My dear Hercules," &s;ays &s;he, "I find you are very much divided in your thoughts upon the way of life that you ought to choo&s;e: be my friend, and fol|low me; I will lead you into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of plea&s;ure, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of the reach of pain, and remove you from all
<PB N="29" REF="021451_0028_0FB3F62C1E18FC90">
the noi&s;e and di&s;quietude of bu&s;ine&s;s. The affairs of either war or peace &s;hall have no power to di&s;turb you. Your whole employment &s;hall be to make your life ea|&s;y, and to entertain every &s;en&s;e with its proper gratifi|cations. Sumptuous tables, beds of ro&s;es, clouds of perfumes, concerts of mu&s;ic, crowds of beauties, are all in readine&s;s to receive you. Come along with me into this region of delights, this world of plea&s;ure, and bid farewel for ever to care, to pain, to bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>Hercules, hearing the lady talk after this manner, de|&s;ired to know her name; to which &s;he an&s;wered, "My friends, and tho&s;e who are well acquainted with me, call me Happine&s;s; but my enemies, and tho&s;e who would injure my reputation, have given me the name of Plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>By this time the other lady was come up, who ad|dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to the young hero in a very different manner.</P>
<P>"Hercules," &s;ays &s;he, "I offer my&s;elf to you, be|cau&s;e I know your are de&s;cended from the gods, and give proofs of that de&s;cent by your love to virtue, and application to the &s;tudies proper for your age. This makes me hope you will gain, both for your&s;elf and me, an immortal reputation. But, before I invite you into my &s;ociety and friend&s;hip, I will be open and &s;in|cere with you, and mu&s;t lay down this as an e&s;tabli&s;hed truth, that there is nothing truly valuable which can be purcha&s;ed without pains and labor. The gods have &s;et a price upon every real and noble plea&s;ure. If you would gain the favor of the Deity, you mu&s;t be at the pains of wor&s;hipping him; if the friend&s;hip of good men, you mu&s;t &s;tudy to oblige them; if you would be honored by your country, you mu&s;t take care to &s;erve it. In &s;hort, if you would be eminent in war or peace, you mu&s;t become ma&s;ter of all the qualifications that can make you &s;o. The&s;e are the only terms and condi|tions upon which I can propo&s;e happine&s;s." The god|de&s;s of Plea&s;ure here broke in upon her di&s;cour&s;e: "You &s;ee," &s;aid &s;he, "Hercules, by her own confe&s;|&s;ion, the way to her plea&s;ures is long and difficult; whereas that which I propo&s;e is &s;hort and ea&s;y." "A|las." &s;aid the other lady, who&s;e vi&s;age glowed with
<PB N="30" REF="021451_0029_0FB3F62D9F147F48">
pa&s;&s;ion, made up of &s;corn and pity, "what are the plea&s;ures you propo&s;e? To eat before you are hungry, drink before you are athri&s;t, &s;leep before your are tired; to gratify appetites before they are rai&s;ed, and rai&s;e &s;uch appetites as nature never planted. You never heard the mo&s;t delicious mu&s;ic, which is the prai&s;e of one's &s;elf; nor &s;aw the mo&s;t beautiful object, which is the work of one's own hands. Your votaries pa&s;s away their youth in a dream of mi&s;taken plea&s;ures, while they are hoarding up angui&s;h, torment, and remor&s;e, for old age.</P>
<P>"As for me, I am the friend of gods and of good men, an agreeable companion to the artizan, an hou&s;e|hold guardian to the fathers of families, a patron and protector of &s;ervants, an a&s;&s;ociate in all true and gene|rous friend&s;hips. The banquets of my votaries are ne|ver co&s;tly, but always delicious; for none eat and drink at them who are not invited by hunger and thir&s;t. Their &s;lumbers are &s;ound, and their wakings cheerful. My young men have the plea&s;ure of hearing them&s;elves prai&s;ed by tho&s;e who are in years; and tho&s;e who are in years, of being honored by tho&s;e who are young. In a word, my followers are favored by the gods, be|loved by their acquaintance, e&s;teemed by their country, and, after the clo&s;e of their labors, honored by po|&s;terity."</P>
<P>We know, by the life of this memorable hero, to which of the&s;e two ladies he gave up his heart; and I believe every one who reads this, will do him the ju|&s;tice to approve his choice.</P>

<LETTER>
<P>"Dear Spec,&mdash;I was about two nights ago in compa|ny which very agreeable young people of both &s;exes,

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere, talking of &s;ome of your papers which are writ|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n conjugal love, there aro&s;e a di&s;pute among us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er there were not more bad hu&s;bands in the world than bad wives. A gentleman, who was advocate for the ladies, took this occa&s;ion to tell us the &s;tory of a famous &s;iege in Germany; which I have &s;ince found re|lated in my hi&s;torical dictionary after the following manner. When the Emperor Conrade III. had be&s;ieg|ed Guelphus, Duke of Bavaria, in the city of Hen&s;|berg, the women, finding that the town could not po&s;|&s;ibly hold out long, petitioned the Emperor that they might depart out of it with &s;o much as each of them could carry. The Emperor, knowing they could not convey away many of their effects, granted them their petition; when the women, to his great &s;urpri&s;e, came out of the place with every one her hu&s;band upon her back. The Emperor was &s;o moved at the &s;ight, that he bur&s;t into tears; and after having very much extol|led the women for their conjugal affection, gave the men to their wives, and received the Duke into his fa|vor.</P>
<P>"The ladies did not a little triumph at this &s;tory; a&s;king us at the &s;ame time, whether in our con&s;ciences we believed that the men in any town of Great Britain would, upon the &s;ame offer, and at the &s;ame conjunc|ture, have loaded them&s;elves with their wives? or ra|ther, whether they would not have been glad of &s;uch an opportunity to get rid of them? To this my very good friend Tom Dapperwit, who took upon him to be the mouth of our &s;ex, replied, that they would be very much to blame if they would not do the &s;ame good of|fice for the women, con&s;idering that their &s;trength would be greater, and their burdens lighter. As we were amu|&s;ing our&s;elves with di&s;cour&s;es of this nature, in order to pa&s;s away the evening, which now begins to grow te|dious, we fell into that laudable and primitive diver&s;ion of que&s;tions and commands. I was no &s;ooner ve&s;ted with the regal authority, but I enjoined all the ladies, under pain of my di&s;plea&s;ure, to tell the company in|genuou&s;ly, in ca&s;e they had been in the &s;iege above|mentioned, and had the &s;ame offers made them as the

There were &s;everal merry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> made to my que&s;tion, which entertained us till bed-time. This filled my mind with &s;uch a huddle of ideas, that upon my going to &s;leep I fell into the following dream.</P>
<P>"I &s;aw a town of this i&s;land, which &s;hall be name|le&s;s, inve&s;ted on every &s;ide, and the inhabitants of it &s;o &s;traitened as to cry for quarter. The general refu&s;ed any other terms than tho&s;e granted to the above men|tioned town of Hen&s;berg, namely, that the married wo|men might come out with what they could bring along with them. Immediately the city gates flew open, and a female proce&s;&s;ion appeared, multitudes of the &s;ex fol|lowing one another in a row, and &s;taggering under their re&s;pective burdens. I took my &s;tand upon an eminence in the enemy's camp, which was appointed for the ge|neral rendezvous of the&s;e female carriers, being very de&s;irous to look into their &s;everal ladings. The fir&s;t of them had a huge &s;ack upon her &s;houlders, which &s;he &s;et down with great care: upon the opening of it, when I expected to have &s;een her hu&s;band &s;hot out of it, I found it was filled with china-ware. The next appear|ed in a more decent figure, carrying a hand&s;ome young fellow upon her back: I could not forbear commending the young woman for her conjugal affection, when to my great &s;urpri&s;e, I found that &s;he had left the good man at home, and brought away her gallant. I &s;aw the third, at &s;ome di&s;tance, with a little withered face peeping over her &s;houlder, whom I could not &s;u&s;pect for any but her &s;pou&s;e, till, upon her &s;etting him down, I heard her call him dear pug, and found him to be her favorite monkey. A fourth brought a huge bale of cards along with her; and the fifth a Bologna lap|dog; for her hu&s;band, it &s;eems, being a very bulky man, &s;he thought it would be le&s;s trouble for her to bring away little cupid. The next was the wife of a rich u&s;erer loaden with a bag of gold; &s;he told us that her &s;pou&s;e was very old, and by the cour&s;e of nature could not expect to live long; and that to &s;how her tender regard for him, &s;he had &s;aved that which the

<P>"It would be endle&s;s to mention the &s;everal per&s;ons, with their &s;everal loads, that appeared to me in this &s;trange vi&s;ion. All the place about me was covered with packs of ribbands, brocades, embroidery, and ten thou|&s;and other materials, &s;ufficient to have furni&s;hed a whole &s;treet of toy-&s;hops. One of the women, having an hu&s;band who was none of the heavie&s;t, was bringing him off upon her &s;houlders, at the &s;ame time that &s;he carried a great bundle of Flanders lace under her arm; but finding her&s;elf &s;o overloaden that &s;he could not &s;ave both of them, &s;he dropped the good man, and brought away the bundle. In &s;hort, I found but one hu&s;band among this great mountain of baggage, who was a lively cobler, that kicked and &s;purred all the while his wife was carrying him on, and, as it was &s;aid, had &s;carce pa&s;&s;ed a day in his life without giving her the di&s;cipline of the &s;trap.</P>
<P>"I cannot conclude my letter, dear Spec, without telling thee one very odd whim in this my dream. I &s;aw, methought, a dozen women employed in bringing off one man: I could not gue&s;s who it &s;hould be, till upon his nearer approach I di&s;covered thy &s;hort phiz.

<HEAD>XXI. ON GOOD BREEDING.</HEAD>
<P>A FRIEND of yours and mine has very ju&s;tly defined good breeding to be, "the re&s;ult of much good &s;en&s;e, &s;ome good nature, and a little &s;elf-denial for the &s;ake of others, and with a view to obtain the &s;ame indul|gence from them." Taking this for granted, (as I think it cannot be di&s;puted) it is a&s;toni&s;hing to me, that any body, who has good &s;en&s;e and good nature, can e&s;|&s;entially fail in good breeding. As to the modes of it, indeed, they vary according to per&s;ons, places, and cir|cum&s;tances, and are only to be acquired by ob&s;ervation and experience; but the &s;ub&s;tance of it is every where and eternally the &s;ame. Good manners are, to particu|lar &s;ocieties, what good morals are to &s;ociety in gene|ral; their cement, and their &s;ecurity. And, as laws are enacted to enforce good morals, or at lea&s;t to prevent the ill effects of bad ones; &s;o there are certain rules of civility, univer&s;ally implied and received, to enforce good manners and puni&s;h bad ones. And, indeed, there &s;eems to me to be le&s;s difference, both between the crimes and puni&s;hments, than at fir&s;t one would imagine. The immoral man, who invades another's property, is ju&s;tly hanged for it; and the ill-bred man, who, by his ill manners, invades and di&s;turbs the quiet and comforts of private life, is by common con&s;ent as ju&s;tly bani&s;hed &s;o|ciety. Mutual complai&s;ances, attentions, and &s;acrifices of little conveniences, are as natural an implied compact between civilized people, as protection and obedience are between kings and &s;ubjects; whoever, in either ca&s;e, violates that compact, ju&s;tly forfeits all advantages ari|&s;ing from it. For my own part, I really think that, next to the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doing a good action, that of doing a civil one is the mo&s;t plea&s;ing: and the epithet which I &s;hould covet the mo&s;t, next to to that of Ari&s;ti|des, would be that of well-bred. Thus much for good-breeding in general: I will now con&s;ider &s;ome of the various modes and degrees of it.</P>
<P>Very few, &s;carcely any, are wanting in the re&s;pect which they &s;hould &s;how to tho&s;e whom they acknow|ledge
<PB N="35" REF="021451_0034_0FB3F6351E586308">
to be highly their &s;uperiors; &s;uch as crowned heads, princes, and public per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed and eminent po&s;ts. It is the manner of &s;howing that re&s;pect which is different. The man of fa&s;hion and of the world, expre&s;&s;es it in its fulle&s;t extent; but naturally, ea&s;ily, and without concern: whereas a man who is not u&s;ed to keep good company, expre&s;&s;es it awkwardly; one &s;ees that he is not u&s;ed to it, and that it co&s;ts him a great deal; but I never &s;aw the wor&s;t-bred man li|ving, guilty of lolling, whi&s;tling, &s;cratching his head, and &s;uch like indecencies, in company that he re&s;pected. In &s;uch companies, therefore, the only point to be at|tended to is, to &s;how that re&s;pect, which every body means to &s;how, in an ea&s;y, unembarra&s;&s;ed, and grace|ful manner. This is what ob&s;ervation and experience mu&s;t teach you.</P>
<P>In mixed companies, whoever is admitted to make part of them, is, for the time at lea&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ed to be upon a footing of equality with the re&s;t; and, con&s;e|quently, as there is no one principal object of awe and re&s;pect, people are apt to take a greater latitude in their behavior, and to be le&s;s upon their guard; and &s;o they may, provided it be within certain bounds, which are upon no occa&s;ion to be tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed. But upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, though no one is entitled to di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of re&s;pect, every one claims, and very ju&s;tly, every mark of civility and good breeding. Ea&s;e is al|lowed, carele&s;sne&s;s and negligence are &s;trictly for|bidden. If a man acco&s;ts you, and talk to you ever &s;o dully or frivolou&s;ly, it is wor&s;e than rudene&s;s, it is brutality, to &s;how him, by a manife&s;t inattention to what he &s;ays, that you think him a fool or a block|head, and not worth hearing. It is much more &s;o with regard to women; who, of whatever rank they are, are intitled, in con&s;ideration of their &s;ex, not only to an attentive, but an officious, good breeding from men. Their little wants, likings, di&s;likes, preferences, anti|pathies, and fancies, mu&s;t be officiou&s;ly attended to, and, if po&s;&s;ible, gue&s;&s;ed at and anticipated, by a well-bred man. You mu&s;t never u&s;urp to your&s;elf tho&s;e con|veniencies and gratifications which are of common right; &s;uch as the be&s;t places, the be&s;t di&s;hes, &amp;c. but, on the
<PB N="36" REF="021451_0035_0FB3F6369EA1CC00">
contrary, always decline them your&s;elf, and offer them to others; who, in their turns, will offer them to you; &s;o that, upon the whole, you will, in your turn, enjoy your &s;hare of the common right. It would be endle&s;s for me to enumerate all the particular in&s;tances in which a well-bred man &s;hows his good breeding in good com|pany; and it would be injurious to you to &s;uppo&s;e, that your own good &s;en&s;e will not point them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut to you, and then your own good nature will recommend, and your &s;elf-intere&s;t enforce, the practice.</P>
<P>There is a third &s;ort of good breeding, in which people are the mo&s;t apt to fail, from a very mi&s;taken notion that they cannot fail at all. I mean with re|gard to one's mo&s;t familiar friends and acquaintances, or tho&s;e who really are our inferiors; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d there, undoubt|edly, a greater degree of ea&s;e is not only allowable but proper, and contributes much to the comforts of a pri|vate &s;ocial life. But ea&s;e and freedom have their bounds, which mu&s;t by no means be violated. A cer|tain degree of neglience and carele&s;sne&s;s becomes in|jurious and in&s;ulting, from the real or &s;uppo&s;ed inferio|rity of the per&s;ons; and that delightful liberty of con|ver&s;ation among a few friends, is &s;oon de&s;troyed, as li|berty often has been, by being carried to licentiou&s;ne&s;s. But example explains things be&s;t; and I will put a pretty &s;trong ca&s;e. Suppo&s;e you and me alone toge|ther; I believe you will allow that I have as good a right to unlimited freedom in your company, as either you or I can po&s;&s;ibly have in any other; and I am apt to believe, too, that you would indulge me in that free|dom as far as any body would. But, notwith&s;tanding this, do you imagine that I &s;hould think there were no bounds to that freedom? I a&s;&s;ure you I &s;hould not think &s;o; and I take my&s;elf to be as much tied down by a certain degree of good manners to you, as by other degrees of them to other people. The mo&s;t familiar and intimate habitudes, connections, and friend&s;hips, require a degree of good breeding both to pre&s;erve and cement them. The be&s;t of us have our bad &s;ides; and it is as imprudent as it is ill-bred, to exhibit them. I &s;hall not u&s;e ceremony with you; it would be mi&s;placed between us; but I &s;hall certainly ob&s;erve that degree of
<PB N="37" REF="021451_0036_0FB3F6382C69EF20">
good breeding with you which is, in the fir&s;t place, de|cent, and which, I am &s;ure, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to make us like one another's company long.</P>

<HEAD>XXII. ADDRESS TO A YOUNG STUDENT.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR parents have watched over your helple&s;s in|fancy, and conducted you, with many a pang, to an age at which your mind is capable of manly improve|ment. Their &s;olicitude &s;till continues, and no trouble nor expence is &s;pared in giving you all the in&s;tructions and accompli&s;hments which may enable you to act your part in life, as a man of poli&s;hed &s;en&s;e and confirmed virtue. You have, then, already contracted a great debt of gratitude to them. You can pay it by no other method but by u&s;ing the advantages which their good|ne&s;s has afforded you.</P>
<P>If your own endeavors are deficient, it is in vain that you have tutors, books, and all the external apparatus of literary pur&s;uits. You mu&s;t love learning, if you would po&s;&s;e&s;s it. In order to love it, you mu&s;t feel its delights; in order to feel its delights, you mu&s;t apply to it, however irk&s;ome at fir&s;t, clo&s;ely, con&s;tantly, and for a con&s;iderable time. If you have re&s;olution enough to do this, you cannot but love learning; for the mind al|ways loves that to which it has been long, &s;teadily, and voluntarily attached. Habits are formed, which render what was at fir&s;t di&s;agreeable, not only plea&s;ant, but nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ant, indeed, are all the paths which lead to po|lite and elegant literature. Yours, then, is &s;urely a lot particularly happy. Your education is of &s;uch a &s;ort, that its principal &s;cope is to prepare you to receive a refined plea&s;ure during your life. Elegance, or delicacy of ta&s;te, is one of the fir&s;t objects of a cla&s;&s;ical di&s;cipline; and it is this fine quality which opens a new world to the &s;cholar's view. Elegance of ta&s;te has a connection with many virtues, and all of them virtues of the mo&s;t amiable kind. It tends to render you at once good and agreeable. You mu&s;t therefore be an enemy to your own enjoyments, if you enter on the di&s;cipline which leads to the attainment of a cla&s;&s;ical and liberal educa|tion, with reluctance. Value duly the opportunities you
<PB N="38" REF="021451_0037_0FB3F6399D92D8B8">
enjoy, and which are denied to thou&s;ands of your fellow creatures.</P>
<P>Without exemplary diligence you will make but a con|temptible proficiency. You may, indeed, pa&s;s through the forms of &s;chools and univer&s;ities, but you will bring nothing away from them of real value. The proper &s;ort and degree of diligence you cannot po&s;&s;e&s;s, but by the effects of your own re&s;olution. Your in&s;tructor may indeed, confine you within the walls of a &s;chool a cer|tain number of hours. He may place books before you, and compel you to fix your eyes upon them; but no authority can chain down your mind. Your thoughts will e&s;cape from every external re&s;traint, and, amid&s;t the mo&s;t &s;erious lectures, may be ranging in the wild pur|&s;uit of trifles or vice. Rules, re&s;traints, commands, and puni&s;hments, may, indeed, a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;trengthening your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;olution; but, without your own voluntary choice y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r diligence will not often conduce to your plea&s;ure or advantage. Though this truth is obvious, yet it &s;eems to be a &s;ecret to tho&s;e parents who expect to find their &s;on's improvement increa&s;e in proportion to the number of tutors and external a&s;&s;i&s;tances which their opulence has enabled them to provide. The&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances, indeed, are &s;ometimes afforded, chiefly that the young heir to a title or e&s;tate may indulge him&s;elf in idlene&s;s and nomi|nal plea&s;ures. The le&s;&s;on is con&s;trued to him, and the exerci&s;e written for him by the private tutor, while the haple&s;s youth is engaged in &s;ome ruinous plea&s;ure, which, at the &s;ame time, prevents him from learning any thing de&s;ireable, and leads to the formation of de&s;tructive ha|bits, which can &s;eldom be removed.</P>
<P>But the principal ob&s;tacle to your improvement at &s;chool, e&s;pecially if you are too plentifully &s;upplied with money, is a perver&s;e ambition of being di&s;tingui&s;hed as a body of &s;pirit in mi&s;chievous pranks, in neglecting the ta&s;ks and le&s;&s;ons, and for every vice and irregularity which the puerile age can admit. You will have &s;en&s;e enough, I hope, to di&s;cover, beneath the ma&s;k of gaiety and good-nature, that malignant &s;pirit of detraction, which endeavors to render the boy who applies to books, and to all the duties and proper bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;chool, ridiculous. You will &s;ee, by the light of your
<PB N="39" REF="021451_0038_0FB3F63B1E405E98">
rea&s;on, that the ridicule is mi&s;applied. You will di&s;|cover, that the boys who have recour&s;e to ridicule, are, for the mo&s;t part, &s;tupid, unfeeling, ignorant, and vi|cious. Their noi&s;y folly, their bold confidence, their contempt of learning, and their defiance of authority, are, for the mo&s;t part, the genuine effects of hardened in&s;en&s;ibility. Let not their in&s;ults and ill-treatment di&s;pirit you. If you yield to them with a tame and ab|ject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, they will not fail to triumph over you with additional in&s;olence. Di&s;play a fortitude in your pur&s;uits, equal in degree to the ob&s;tinacy in which they per&s;i&s;t in theirs. Your fortitude will &s;oon overcome theirs, which is, indeed, &s;eldom any thing more than the audacity of a bully. Indeed, you cannot go through a &s;chool with ea&s;e to your&s;elf, and with &s;ucce&s;s, without a con&s;iderable &s;hare of courage. I do not mean that &s;ort of courage which leads to battles and contentions, but which enables you to have a will of your own, and to pur&s;ue what is right, amid&s;t all the per&s;ecutions of &s;urrounding enviers, dunces, and detractors. Ridicule is the weapon made u&s;e of at &s;chool, as well as in the world, when the fortre&s;&s;es of virtue are to be a&s;&s;ailed. You will effectually repel the attack by a dauntle&s;s &s;pi|rit and unyielding per&s;everance. Though numbers are again&s;t you, yet, with truth and rectitude on your &s;ide, you may, though alone, be equal to an army.</P>
<P>By laying in a &s;tore of u&s;eful knowledge, adorning your mind with elegant literature, improving and e&s;ta|bli&s;hing your conduct by virtuous principles, you cannot fail of being a comfort to tho&s;e friends who have &s;up|ported you, of being happy within your&s;elf, and of be|ing well received by mankind. Honor and &s;ucce&s;s in life will probably attend you. Under all circum&s;tances you will have an internal &s;ource of con&s;olation and en|tertainment, of which no &s;ublunary vici&s;&s;itude can de|prive you. Time will &s;how how much wi&s;er has been your choice than that of your idle companions, who would gladly have drawn you into their a&s;&s;ociation, or rather into their con&s;piracy, as it has been called, again&s;t good manners, and again&s;t all that is honorable and u&s;eful. While you appear in &s;ociety as a re&s;pectable and va|luable member of it, they will, perhaps, have &s;acrificed,

<HEAD>XXIII. ADVANTAGES OF, AND MOTIVES TO, CHEERFULNESS.</HEAD>
<P>CHEERFULNESS is, in the fir&s;t place, the be&s;t pro|moter of health. Repining<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and &s;ecret murmurs of heart give imperceptible &s;trokes to tho&s;e delicate fibres of which the vital parts are compo&s;ed, and wear out the machine in&s;en&s;ibly; not to mention tho&s;e violent fer|ments which they &s;tir up in the blood, and tho&s;e irre|gular di&s;turbed motions which they rai&s;e in the animal &s;pirits. I &s;carce remember, in my own ob&s;ervation, to have met with many old men, or with &s;uch who (to u&s;e our Engli&s;h phra&s;e) 'wear well,' that had not at lea&s;t a certain indolence in their humor, if not a more than ordinary gaiety and cheerfulne&s;s of heart. The truth of it is, health and cheerfulne&s;s mutually beget each other; with this difference, that we &s;eldom meet with a great degree of health which is not attended with a certain cheerfulne&s;s, but very often &s;ee cheerfulne&s;s where there is no great degree of health.</P>
<P>Cheerfulne&s;s bears the &s;ame friendly regard to the mind as to the body: it bani&s;hes all anxious care and di&s;content, &s;oothes and compo&s;es the pa&s;&s;ions, and keeps the &s;oul in a perpetual calm.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the world in its &s;ub&s;erviency to man, one would think it was made for our u&s;e; but if we con&s;ider it in its natural beauty and harmony, one would be apt to conclude it was made for our plea&s;ure. The &s;un, which is as the great &s;oul of the univer&s;e, and pro|duces all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, has a particular influence in cheering the mind of man, and making the heart glad.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;everal living creatures which are made for our &s;ervice or &s;u&s;tenance, at the &s;ame time either fill the woods with their mu&s;ic, furni&s;h us with game, or rai&s;e plea&s;ing ideas in us by the delightfulne&s;s of their ap|pearance. Fountains, lakes, and rivers, are as refre&s;h|ing to the imagination, as to the &s;oil through which they pa&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="021451_0040_0FB3F63E231BA008">There are writers of great di&s;tinction, who have made it an argument for Providence, that the whole earth is covered with green, rather than with any other color, as being &s;uch a right mixture of light and &s;hade, that it comforts and &s;trengthens the eye in&s;tead of weakening or grieving it. For this rea&s;on, &s;everal painters have a green cloth hanging near them, to ea&s;e the eye upon, after too great an application to their coloring. A famous modern philo&s;opher accounts for it in the fol|lowing manner: All colors that are more luminous, overpower and di&s;&s;ipate the animal &s;pirits which are em|ployed in &s;ight; on the contrary, tho&s;e that are more ob&s;cure do not give the animal &s;pirits a &s;ufficient exer|ci&s;e: whereas the rays that produce in us the idea of green, fall upon the eye in &s;uch a due proportion, that they give the animal &s;pirits their proper play, and by keeping up the &s;truggle in a ju&s;t balance, excite a very plea&s;ing and agreeable &s;en&s;ation. Let the cau&s;e be what it will, the effect is certain; for which rea&s;on the poets a&s;cribe to this particular color the epithet of Cheerful.</P>
<P>To con&s;ider further this double end in the works of nature, and how they are at the &s;ame time both u&s;eful and entertaining, we find that the mo&s;t important parts in the vegetable world are tho&s;e which are the mo&s;t beautiful. The&s;e are the &s;eeds by which the &s;everal races of plants are propagated and continued, and which are always lodged in flowers or blo&s;&s;oms. Nature &s;eems to hide her principal de&s;ign, and to be indu&s;trious in making the earth gay and delightful, while &s;he is car|rying on her great work, and intent upon her own pre|&s;ervation. The hu&s;bandman, after the &s;ame manner, is employed in laying out the whole country into a kind of garden or land&s;cape, and making everything &s;mile about him, whil&s;t, in reality, he thinks of nothing but of the harve&s;t, and increa&s;e which is to ari&s;e from it.</P>
<P>We may further ob&s;erve how Providence has taken care to keep up this cheerfulne&s;s in the mind of man, by having formed it after &s;uch a manner, as to make it ca|pable of conceiving delight from &s;everal objects which &s;eem to have very little u&s;e in them; as from the wild|ne&s;s of rocks and de&s;erts, and the like grote&s;que parts of nature. Tho&s;e who are ver&s;ed in philo&s;ophy may &s;till
<PB N="42" REF="021451_0041_0FB3F63F9DAF9430">
carry this con&s;ideration higher, by ob&s;erving, that, if matter had appeared to us endowed only with tho&s;e real qualities which it actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, it would have made but a very joyle&s;s and uncomfortable figure; and why has Providence given it a power of producing in us &s;uch imaginary qualities, as ta&s;tes and colors, &s;ounds and &s;mells, heat and cold, but that man, while he is conver|&s;ant in the lower &s;tations of nature, might have his mind cheered and delighted with agreeable &s;en&s;ations? In &s;hort, the whole univer&s;e is a kind of theatre filled with ob|jects that either rai&s;e in us plea&s;ure, amu&s;ement, or ad|miration.</P>
<P>The reader's own thoughts will &s;ugge&s;t to him the vici&s;&s;itude of day and night, the change of &s;ea&s;ons, with all that variety of &s;cenes which diver&s;ify the face of na|ture, and fill the mind with a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of beautiful and plea&s;ing images.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not here mention the &s;everal entertainments of art, with the plea&s;ures of friend&s;hip, books, conver&s;a|tion, and other accidental diver&s;ions of life, becau&s;e I would only take notice of &s;uch enticements to a cheer|ful temper, as offer them&s;elves to per&s;ons of all ranks and conditions, and which may &s;ufficiently &s;how us, that Providence did not de&s;ign the world &s;hould be filled with murmurs and repinings, or that the heart of man &s;hould be involved in gloom and melancholy.</P>
<P>I the more inculcate this cheerfulne&s;s of temper, as it is a virtue in which our countrymen are ob&s;erved to be more deficient than any other nation. Melancholy is a kind of demon that haunts our i&s;land, and often conveys her&s;elf to us in an ea&s;terly wind. A celebrated French noveli&s;t, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e who begin their romances with the flowery &s;ea&s;ons of the year, enters on his &s;tory thus:
<Q>In the gloomy month of November, when the people of England hang and drown them&s;elves, a di&s;|con&s;olate lover walked out into the fields, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Every one ought to fence again&s;t the temper of his climate or con&s;titution, and frequently to indulge in him|&s;elf tho&s;e con&s;iderations which may give him a &s;erenity of mind, and enable him to bear up cheerfully again&s;t tho&s;e little evils and misfortunes which are common to human nature, and which, by a right improvement of
<PB N="43" REF="021451_0042_0FB3F6411E32C620">
them, will produce a &s;atiety of joy, and uninterrupted happine&s;s.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that I would engage my reader to con&s;ider the world in its mo&s;t agreeable lights, I mu&s;t own there are many evils which naturally &s;pring up a|mid&s;t the entertainments that are provided for us; but the&s;e if rightly con&s;idered, &s;hould be far from overca&s;t|ing the mind with &s;orrow, or de&s;troying that cheerfulne&s;s of temper which I have been recommending. This in|ter&s;per&s;ion of evil with good, and pain with plea&s;ure, in the works of nature, is very truly a&s;cribed by Mr. Locke, in his e&s;&s;ay on human under&s;tanding, to a moral rea&s;on, in the following words:</P>
<P><Q>Beyond all this, we may find another rea&s;on why God hath &s;cattered up and down &s;everal degrees of plea&s;ure and pain, in all the things that environ and affect us, and blended them together in almo&s;t all that our thoughts and &s;en&s;es have to do with; that we, finding imperfection, di&s;&s;atisfaction, and want of complete happine&s;s in all the enjoyments which the creatures can afford us, might be led to &s;eek it in the enjoyment of Him, 'with whom there is fulne&s;s of joy, and at who&s;e right-hand are plea&s;ures for ever|more.</Q></P>

<HEAD>I. THE BAD READER.</HEAD>
<P>JULIUS had acquired great credit at Cambridge by his compo&s;itions. They were elegant, animated, and judicious; and &s;everal prizes, at different times, had been adjudged to him. An oration, which he delivered the week before he left the univer&s;ity, had been honor|ed with particular applau&s;e; and, on his return home, he was impatient to gratify his vanity, and to extend his reputation, by having it read to a number of his father's literary friends.</P>
<P>A party was therefore collected; and, after dinner, the manu&s;cript was produced. Julius declined the office of reader, becau&s;e he had contracted a hoar&s;ene&s;s on his journey; and a conceited young man, with great for|wardne&s;s, offered his &s;ervices. Whil&s;t he was &s;ettling him&s;elf on his &s;eat, licking his lips, adju&s;ting his mouth, hawking, hemming, and making other ridiculous prepa|rations for the performance which he had undertaken, a profound &s;ilence reigned through the company, the uni|ted effect of attention and expectation. The reader at length began; but his tone of voice was &s;o &s;hrill and di&s;|&s;onant, his utterance &s;o vehement, his pronunciation &s;o affected, his empha&s;is &s;o injudicious, and his accents were &s;o improperly placed, that good manners alone re&s;trained the laughter of the audience. Julius was all this while upon the rack, and his arm was more than once extend|ed to &s;natch his compo&s;ition from the coxcomb who de|livered it. But he proceeded, with full confidence in his own elocution; uniformly over&s;tepping, as Shake&s;peare expre&s;&s;es it, the mode&s;ty of nature.</P>
<P>When the oration was concluded, the gentlemen re|turned their thanks to the author; but the compliments which they paid him were more expre&s;&s;ive of politene&s;s and civility, than of a conviction of his merit. Indeed, The beauties of his compo&s;ition had been converted, by bad reading, into blemi&s;hes; and the &s;en&s;e of it rendered
<PB N="45" REF="021451_0044_0FB3F6441CBFC1A8">
ob&s;cure, and even unintelligible. Julius and his father could not conceal their vexation and di&s;appointment; and the gue&s;ts, perceiving that they laid them under a painful re&s;traint, withdrew, as &s;oon as decency permit|ted, to their re&s;pective habitations.</P>

<HEAD>II. RESPECT DUE TO OLD AGE.</HEAD>
<P>IT happened at Athens, during a public repre&s;entation of &s;ome play exhibited in honor of the commonwealth, that an old gentleman came too late for a place &s;uitable to his age and quality. Many of the young gentlemen, who ob&s;erved the difficulty and confu&s;ion he was in, made &s;igns to him that they would accommodate him if he came where they &s;at. The good man bu&s;tled through the crowd accordingly: but when he came to the &s;eats to which he was invited, the je&s;t was, to &s;it clo&s;e, and expo&s;e him as he &s;tood out of countenance, to the whole audience. The frolic went round all the Athenian benches. But on tho&s;e occa&s;ions there where al&s;o par|ticular places a&s;&s;igned for foreigners. When the good man &s;kulked towards the boxes appointed for the Lace|demonians, that hone&s;t people, more virtuous than po|lite, ro&s;e up all to a man, and with greate&s;t re&s;pect received him among them. The Athenians being &s;ud|denly touched with a &s;en&s;e of the Spartan virtue and their own degeneracy, gave a thunder of applau&s;e; and the old man cried out, "The Athenians under&s;tand what is good, but the Lacedemonians practi&s;e it."</P>

<HEAD>III. PIETY TO GOD RECOMMENDED TO THE YOUNG.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT I &s;hall fir&s;t recommend, is piety to God. With this I begin, both as the foundation of good morals, and as a di&s;po&s;ition particularly graceful and becoming in youth. To be void of it, argues a cold heart, de&s;ti|tute of &s;ome of the be&s;t affections which belong to that age. Youth is the &s;ea&s;on of warm and generous emotions. The heart &s;hould then &s;pontaneou&s;ly ri&s;e into the ad|miration of what is great; glow with the love of what is fair and excellent; and melt at the di&s;covery of tenderne&s;s and goodne&s;s. Where can any object be found &s;o proper to kindle tho&s;e affections as the Father of the univer&s;e, and the Author of all felicity? Un|moved

by veneration, can you contemplate that gran|deur and maje&s;ty which His works every where di&s;play? Untouched by gratitude, can you view that profu&s;ion of good which, in this plea&s;ing &s;ea&s;on of life, His bene|ficent hand pours around you? Happy in the love and affection of tho&s;e with whom you are connected, look up to the Supreme Being, as the in&s;pirer of all the friend&s;hip which has ever been &s;hown you by others; him&s;elf your be&s;t and your fir&s;t friend: formerly, the &s;upporter of your infancy, and the guide of your child|hood; now, the guardian of your youth, and the hope of your coming years. View religious homage as a natural expre&s;&s;ion of gratitude to him for all his goodne&s;s. Con&s;ider it as the &s;ervice of the God of your fathers; of him to whom your parents devoted you; of him whom, in former ages, your ance&s;tors honored; and by whom they are now rewarded and ble&s;&s;ed in hea|ven. Connected with &s;o many tender &s;en&s;ibilities of &s;oul, let religion be with you, not the cold and barren offspring of &s;peculation, but the warm and vigorous dic|tate of the heart.</P>

<HEAD>IV. MODESTY AND DOCILITY.</HEAD>
<P>To piety, join mode&s;ty and docility, reverence of your parents, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e who are your &s;u|periors in knowledge, in &s;tation, and in years. De|pendence and obedience belong to youth. Mode&s;ty is one of its chief ornaments; and has ever been e&s;teemed a pre&s;age of ri&s;ing merit. When entering on the career of life, it is your part not to a&s;&s;ume the reins as yet into your hands; but to commit your&s;elves to the guidance of the more experienced, and to become wi&s;e by the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e who have gone before you. Of all the follies incident to youth, there are none which either de|form its pre&s;ent appearance, or bla&s;t the pro&s;pect of its future pro&s;perity, more than &s;elf-conceit, pre&s;umption, and ob&s;tinacy. By checking its natural progre&s;s in im|provement, they fix it in long immaturity; and fre|quently produce mi&s;chiefs which can never be repaired. Yet the&s;e are vices too commonly found among the young. Big with enterpri&s;e, and elated by hope, they re&s;olve to tru&s;t for &s;ucce&s;s to none but them&s;elves. Full

<HEAD>V. SINCERITY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary to recommend to you &s;incerity and truth. The&s;e are the ba&s;is of every virtue. That dark|ne&s;s of character, where we can &s;ee no heart; tho&s;e foldings of art, through which no native affection is allowed to penetrate, pre&s;ent an object unamiable in every &s;ea&s;on of life, but particularly odious in youth. If, at an age when the heart is warm, when the emotions are &s;trong, and when nature is expected to &s;how her&s;elf free and open, you can already &s;mile and deceive, what are we to look for when you &s;hall be longer hackneyed in the ways of men; when intere&s;t &s;hall have completed the obduration of your heart, and experience &s;hall have improved you in all the arts of guile? Di&s;&s;imulation in youth is the forerunner of perfidy in old age. Its fir&s;t appearance is the fatal omen of growing depravity and future &s;hame. It degrades parts and learning, ob&s;cures the lu&s;tre of every accompli&s;hment, and &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ks you into contempt with God and man. As you value, therefore, the approbation of heaven or the e&s;teem of the world, cultivate the love of truth. In all your proceedings be direct and con&s;i&s;tent. Ingenuity and candor po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t powerful charm; they be&s;peak univer&s;al favor, and carry an apology for almo&s;t every failing. The path of truth is a plain and &s;afe path; that of fal&s;ehood is a perplexing maze. After the fir&s;t departure from &s;ince|rity, it is not in your power to &s;top. One artifice una|voidably leads on to another; till, as the intricacy of the labyrinth increa&s;es, you are left entangled in your own &s;nare. Deceit di&s;covers a little mind, which &s;tops at temporary expedients, without ri&s;ing to comprehen&s;ive views of conduct. It betrays, at the &s;ame time, a da|&s;tardly &s;pirit. It is the re&s;ource of one who wants cou|rage to avow his de&s;igns, or to re&s;t upon him&s;elf.

which ought to di&s;tingui&s;h youth. To &s;et out in the world with no other principle than a crafty attention to intere&s;t, betokens one who is de&s;tined for creeping through the inferior walks of life: but to give an early preference to honor above gain, when they &s;tand in competition; to de&s;pi&s;e every advantage which cannot be attained without di&s;hone&s;t arts; to brook no mean|ne&s;s, and to &s;toop to no di&s;&s;imulation; are the indications of a great mind, the pre&s;ages of future eminence and di&s;tinction in life. At the &s;ame time, this virtuous &s;incerity is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t prudent vigilance and caution. It is oppo&s;ed to cunning, not to true wi&s;dom. It is not the &s;implicity of a weak and im|provident, but the candor of an enlarged a noble mind; of one who &s;corns deceit, becau&s;e he accounts it both ba&s;e and unprofitable; and who &s;eeks no di&s;gui&s;e, be|cau&s;e he needs none to hide him.</P>

<HEAD>VI. BENEVOLENCE AND HUMANITY.</HEAD>
<P>YOUTH is the proper &s;ea&s;on for cultivating the be|nevolent and humane affections. As a great part of your happine&s;s is to depend on the connections which you form with others, it is of high importance that you acquire betimes the temper and the manners which will render &s;uch connections comfortable. Let a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice be the foundation of all your &s;ocial qualities. In your mo&s;t early intercour&s;e with the world, and even in your youthful amu&s;ements, let no unfairne&s;s be found. Engrave on your mind that &s;acred rule, of "doing in all things to others according as you wi&s;h that they &s;hould do unto you." For this end, impre&s;s your&s;elves with a deep &s;en&s;e of the original and natural equality of men. Whatever advantages of birth or fortune you po&s;&s;e&s;s, never di&s;play them with an o&s;tentatious &s;uperiority. Leave the &s;ubordinations of rank, to regulate the inter|cour&s;e of more advanced years. At pre&s;ent it becomes you to act among your companions as man with man. Remember how unknown to you are the vici&s;&s;itudes of the world; and how often they, on whom ignorant and contemptuous young men once looked down with &s;corn, have ri&s;en to be their &s;uperiors in future years. Com|pa&s;&s;ion is an emotion of which you ought never to be

a&s;hamed. Graceful in youth is the tear of &s;ympathy, and the heart that melts at the tale of woe. Let not ea&s;e and indulgence contract your affections, and wrap you up in &s;elfi&s;h enjoyment. Accu&s;tom your&s;elves to think of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of human life; of the &s;olitary cottage, the dying parent, and the weeping orphan.

<HEAD>VII. INDUSTRY AND APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>DILIGENCE, indu&s;try, and proper improvement of time, are material duties of the young. To no pur|po&s;e are they endowed with the be&s;t abilities, if they want activity for exerting them. Unavailing, in this ca&s;e, will be every direction that can be given them, either for their temporal or &s;piritual welfare. In youth, the habits of indu&s;try are mo&s;t ea&s;ily acquired: in youth, the incentives to it are &s;tronge&s;t, from ambition and from duty, from emulation and hope, from all the pro|&s;pects which the beginning of life affords. If, dead to the&s;e calls, you already langui&s;h in &s;lothful inaction, what will be able to quicken the more &s;luggi&s;h current of ad|vancing years? Indu&s;try is not only the in&s;trument of improvement, but the foundation of plea&s;ure. Nothing is &s;o oppo&s;ite to the true enjoyment of life as the relaxed and feeble &s;tate of an indolent mind. He who is a &s;tranger to indu&s;try may po&s;&s;e&s;s, but he cannot enjoy. For it is labor only which gives the reli&s;h to plea&s;ure. It is the appointed vehicle of every good to man. It is the indi&s;pen&s;able <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion of our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;ound mind in a &s;ound body. Sloth is &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with both, that it is hard to determine whether it be a greater foe to virtue, or to health and happine&s;s. Inactive as it is in it&s;elf, its effects are fatally powerful. Though it appear a &s;lowly-flowing &s;tream, yet it undermines all that is &s;table and flouri&s;hing. It not only &s;aps the foundation of every virtue, but pours upon you a deluge of crimes and evils. It is like water, which fir&s;t putrifies by &s;tagnation, and then &s;ends up no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious vapors, and fills the atmo&s;phere with death.

By &s;uch accompli&s;hments do you hope to recommend your&s;elves to the thinking part of the world, and to an&s;wer the ex|pectation of your friends and your country?&mdash;Amu&s;e|ments youth requires; it were vain, it were cruel, to prohibit them. But, though allowable as the relaxation, they are mo&s;t culpable as the bu&s;ine&s;s, of the young. For they then become the gulph of time and the poi&s;on of the mind. They foment bad pa&s;&s;ions.

<P>REDEEMING your time from &s;uch dangeros wa&s;te, &s;eek to fill it with employments which you may review with &s;atisfaction. The acqui&s;ition of knowledge is one of the mo&s;t honorable occupations of youth. The de&s;ire of it di&s;covers a liberal mind, and is connected with many accompli&s;hments and many virtues. But, though your train of life &s;hould not lead you to &s;tudy, the cour&s;e of education always furni&s;hes proper employments to a well-di&s;po&s;ed mind. Whatever you pur&s;ue, be emulos to excel. Generous ambition, and &s;en&s;ibility to prai&s;e, are, e&s;pecially at your age, among the marks of virtue. Think not that any affluence of fortune, or any eleva|tion of rank, exempts you from the duties of applica|tion and indu&s;try. Indu&s;try is the law of our being; it is the demand of nature, of rea&s;on, and of God. Re|member always, that the years which now pa&s;s over your heads leave permanent memorials behind them. From your thoughtle&s;s minds they may e&s;cape; but they remain in the remembrance of God. They form an important part of the regi&s;ter of your life. They will hereafter bear te&s;timony, either for or again&s;t you, at that day, when, for all your actions, but particularly for the employments of youth, you mo&s;t give an account to God.&mdash;Whether your future cour&s;e is de&s;tined to be-

<HEAD>IX. THE TRUE PATRIOT.</HEAD>
<P>ANDREW DORIA of Genoa, the greate&s;t &s;ea-captain of the age he lived in, &s;et his country free from the yoke of France. Beloved by his fellow-citizens, and &s;up|ported by the emperor Charles V. it was in his power to a&s;&s;ume &s;overeignty without the lea&s;t &s;truggle. But he preferred the virtuous &s;atisfaction of giving liberty to his countrymen. He declared in public a&s;&s;embly, that the happine&s;s of &s;eeing them once more re&s;tored to li|berty, was to him a full reward for all his &s;ervices: that he claimed no pre-eminence above his equals, but remit|ted to them ab&s;olutely to &s;ettle a proper form of govern|ment. Doria's magnanimity put an end to factions that had long vexed the &s;tate: and a form of government was e&s;tabli&s;hed with great unanimity, the &s;ame that, with very little alteration, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts at pre&s;ent. Doria lived to a great age, beloved and honored by his countrymen; and, without ever making a &s;ingle &s;tep out of his rank as a private citizen, he retained to his dying hour great in|fluence in the republic. Power, founded on love and gratitude, was to him more plea&s;ant than what is found|ed on &s;overeignty. His memory is reverenced by the Genoe&s;e; and, in their hi&s;tories and public monuments, there is be&s;towed on him the mo&s;t honorable of all titles &mdash;FATHER of his COUNTRY, and RESTORER of its LIBERTY.</P>

If it cannot remove the di&s;quietudes ari&s;ing out of a man's mind, body, or fortune, it makes him ea&s;y under them.

towards that Being who has allotted him his part to act in this world. It de&s;troys all inordinate am|bition, and every tendency to corruption, with regard to the community wherein he is placed. It gives &s;weetne&s;s to his conver&s;ation, and a perpetual &s;erenity to all his thoughts.</P>
<P>Among the many methods which may be made u&s;e of for the acquiring of this virtue. I &s;hall only mention the two following. Fir&s;t of all, a man &s;hould always con&s;ider how much he has more than he wants; and &s;e|condly, how much more unhappy he might be than he really is.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all, a man &s;hould always con&s;ider how much he has more than he wants. I am wonderfully plea&s;ed with the reply which Ari&s;tippus made to one who con|doled him upon the lo&s;s of a farm: "Why," &s;aid he, "I have three farms &s;till, and you have but one; &s;o that I ought rather to be afflicted for you, than you for me." On the contrary, fooli&s;h men are more apt to con&s;ider what they have lo&s;t than what they po&s;&s;e&s;s; and to fix their eyes upon tho&s;e who are richer than them&s;elves, ra|ther than on tho&s;e who are under greater difficulties. All the real plea&s;ures and conveniencies of life lie in a narrow compa&s;s; but it is the humor of mankind to be always looking forward, and &s;training after one who has got the &s;tart of them in wealth and honor. For this rea&s;on, as there is none can be properly called rich, who have not more than they want; there are few rich men in any of the politer nations but among the middle &s;ort of people, who keep their wi&s;hes within their fortunes, and have more wealth than they know how to enjoy. Per&s;ons of a higher rank live in a kind of &s;plendid poverty; and are perpetually wanting, becau&s;e, in&s;tead of acquie&s;cing in the &s;olid plea&s;ures of life, they endeavor to outvie one another in &s;hadows and appearances. Men of &s;en&s;e have at all times beheld with a great deal of mirth this &s;illy game that is playing over their heads; and, by contract|ing their de&s;ires, enjoy all that &s;ecret &s;atisfaction which others are always in que&s;t of. The truth is, this ridicu|lous chace after imaginary plea&s;ures cannot be &s;ufficient|ly expo&s;ed, as it is the great &s;ource of tho&s;e evils which generally undo a nation. Let a man's e&s;tate be what it
<PB N="53" REF="021451_0052_0FB3F6501F0C9FA8">
wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, he is a poor man if he does not live within it, and naturally &s;ets him&s;elf to &s;ale to any one that can give him his price. When Pittacus, after the death of his brother, who had left him a good e&s;tate, was offered a great &s;um of money by the king of Lydia, he thanked him for his kindne&s;s, but told him he had already more by half than he knew what to do with. In &s;hort, con|tent is equivalent to wealth, and luxury to poverty; or, to give the thought a more agreeable turn, "Con|tent is natural wealth," &s;ays Socrates; to which I &s;hall add, Luxury is artificial poverty. I &s;hall therefore re|commend to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e who are always aiming after &s;uperfluous and imaginary enjoyments, and will not be at the trouble of contracting their de&s;ires, an excellent &s;aying of Bion the philo&s;opher, namely, "That no man has &s;o much care, as he who endeavors af|ter the mo&s;t happine&s;s."</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, every one ought to reflect how much more unhappy he might be than he really is. The former con&s;ideration took in all tho&s;e who are &s;ufficiently provided with the means to make them&s;elves ea&s;y; this regards &s;uch as actually lie under &s;ome pre&s;&s;ure or mi&s;|fortune. The&s;e may receive great alleviation from &s;uch a compari&s;on as the unhappy per&s;on may make between him&s;elf and others, or between the misfortune which he &s;uffers, and greater mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fortunes which might have befal|len him.</P>
<P>I like the &s;tory of the hone&s;t Dutchman, who, upon breaking his leg by a fall from the main-ma&s;t, told the &s;tanders by, it was a great mercy that it was not his neck. To which, &s;ince I have got into quotations, give me leave to add the &s;aying of an old philo&s;opher, who, after having invited &s;ome of his friends to dine with him, was r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">led by his wife that came into the room in a pa&s;|&s;ion, and threw down the table that &s;tood before them: "Every one," &s;ays he, "has his calamity, and he is a happy man that has no greater than this." We find an in&s;tance to the &s;ame purpo&s;e in the life of Doctor Ham|mond, written by Bi&s;hop Fell. As this good man was troubled with a complication of di&s;tempers, when he had the gout upon him, he u&s;ed to thank God that it was

not the &s;tone; and when he had the &s;tone, that he had not both the&s;e di&s;tempers on him at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this e&s;&s;ay without ob&s;erving, that there was never any &s;y&s;tem be&s;ides that of Chri&s;tianity, which could effectually produce in the mind of man, the virtue I have been hitherto &s;peaking of. In order to make us contented with our condition, many of the profe&s;&s;ed philo&s;ophers tell us, that our di&s;content only hurts our&s;elves, without being able to make any altera|tion in our circum&s;tances; others, that whatever evil be|fals us, is derived to us by a fatal nece&s;&s;ity, to which the gods them&s;elves are &s;ubject; while others very gravely tell the man who is mi&s;erable, that it is nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be &s;o to keep up the harmony of the univer&s;e, and that the &s;cheme of Providence would be troubled and per|verted were he otherwi&s;e. The&s;e and the like con&s;idera|tions rather &s;ilence than &s;atisfy a man. They may &s;how him that his di&s;content is unrea&s;onable, but are by no means &s;ufficient to relieve it. They rather give de&s;pair than con&s;olation. In a word, a man might reply to one of the&s;e comforters, as Augu&s;tus did to his friend who advi&s;ed him not to grieve for the death of a per&s;on whom he loved, becau&s;e his grief could not fetch him again: "It is for that very rea&s;on," &s;aid the emperor, "that I grieve."</P>
<P>On the contrary, religion bears a more tender regard to human nature. It pre&s;cribes to every mi&s;erable man the means of bettering his condition; nay, it &s;hows him, that the bearing of his afflictions as he ought to do, will naturally end in the removal of them.

<P>As I was wondering what this profu&s;ion of learning would end in, Will told us that Jack Freelove, who was a fellow of whim, made love to one of tho&s;e ladies who throw away all their fondne&s;s on parrots, monkeys, and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">-dogs. Upon going to pay her a vi&s;it one morning, he write a very pretty epi&s;tle upon this hint. Jack, &s;ays he, was conducted into the parlor, where he diverted him&s;elf for &s;ome time with her favorite monkey, which was chained in one of the windows; till at length ob|&s;erving a pen and ink lie by him, he writ the following letter to his mi&s;tre&s;s, in the per&s;on of the monkey; and upon her not coming down &s;o &s;oon as he expected, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t it in the window, and went about his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The lady, &s;oon after coming into the parlor, and &s;eeing her monkey look upon a paper with great ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, took it up, and to this day is in &s;ome doubt, &s;ays Will, whether it was written by Jack or the mon|key.</P>

<P>"Madam,&mdash;Not having the gift of &s;peech, I have a long time waited in vain for an opportunity of making my&s;elf known to you; and having at pre&s;ent the con|venience of pen, ink, and paper by me, I gladly take the occa&s;ion of giving you my hi&s;tory in writing, which I could not do by word of mouth. You mu&s;t know, Madam, that about a thou&s;and years ago I was an In|dian Bramin, and ver&s;ed in all tho&s;e my&s;terious &s;e|crets which your European philo&s;opher, called Pytha|goras, is &s;aid to have learned from our fraternity. I had &s;o ingratiated my&s;elf by my great &s;kill in the occult &s;ciences with a demon whom I u&s;ed to conver&s;e with, that he promi&s;ed to grant me whatever I &s;hould a&s;k of him. I de&s;ired that my &s;oul might never pa&s;s into the
<PB N="56" REF="021451_0055_0FB3F6549FA810A0">
body of a brute creature; but this, he told me, was not in his power to grant me. I then begged, that into whatever creature I &s;hould chance to tran&s;migrate, I might &s;till retain my memory, and be con&s;cious that I was the &s;ame per&s;on who lived in different animals. This he told me was within his power; and according|ly promi&s;ed, on the word of a demon, that he would grant me what I de&s;ired. From that time forth I lived &s;o very unblameably, that I was made pre&s;ident of a college of Bramins; an office which I di&s;charged with great integrity till the day of my death.</P>
<P>"I was then &s;huffled into another human body, and acted my part &s;o very well in it, that I became fir&s;t mi|ni&s;ter to a prince who reigned upon the banks of the Ganges. I here lived in great honor for &s;everal years, but by degrees lo&s;t all the innocence of the Bramin, being obliged to rifle and oppre&s;s the people to enrich my &s;overeign; till at length I became &s;o odious, that my ma&s;ter, to recover his credit with his &s;ubjects, &s;hot me through the heart with an arrow, as I was one day addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to him at the head of his army.</P>
<P>"Upon my next remove, I found my&s;elf in the woods, under the &s;hape of a jackall, and &s;oon li&s;ted my&s;elf in the &s;ervice of a lion; I u&s;ed to yelp near his den about midnight, which was his time of rou&s;ing and &s;eeking after his prey. He always followed me in the rear; and when I had run down a fair buck, a wild goat, or a hare, after he had fea&s;ted very plentifully upon it him|&s;elf, would now and then throw me a bone that was but half picked for my encouragement; but upon my being un&s;ucce&s;sful in two or three chaces, he gave me &s;uch a confounded gripe in his anger that I died of it.</P>
<P>"In my next tran&s;migration I was again &s;et upon two legs, and become an Indian tax-gatherer; but having been guilty of great extravagancies, and being married to an expen&s;ive jade of a wife, I ran &s;o cur&s;ed|ly in debt, that I dur&s;t not &s;how my head. I could no &s;ooner &s;tep out of my hou&s;e, but I was arre&s;ted by &s;ome body or other that lay in wait for me. As I ventured abroad one night in the du&s;k of the evening, I was taken up and hurried into a dungeon, where I died a few months after.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="021451_0056_0FB3F6561E19BFE0">"My &s;oul then entered into a flying fi&s;h; and in that &s;tate led a mo&s;t melancholy life for the &s;pace of &s;ix years. Several fi&s;hes of prey pur&s;ued me when I was in the water; and if I betook my&s;elf to my wings, it was ten to one but I had a flock of birds aiming at me. As I was one day flying amid&s;t a fleet of Engli&s;h &s;hips, I ob&s;erved a huge &s;ea-gull whetting his bill, and hovering ju&s;t over my head: upon my dipping into the water to avoid him, I fell into the mouth of a mon&s;trous &s;hark that &s;wallowed me down in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>"I was, &s;ome years afterwards to my great &s;urpri&s;e, an eminent banker in Lombard-&s;treet; and remember|ing how I had formerly &s;uffered for want of money, be|come &s;o very &s;ordid and avaricious, that the whole town cried Shame on me. I was a mi&s;erable little old fellow to look upon; for I had in a manner &s;tarved my&s;elf, and was nothing but &s;kin and bone when I died.</P>
<P>"I was afterwards very much troubled and amazed to find my&s;elf dwindled into an e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">met. I was heartily concerned to make &s;o in&s;ignificant a figure; and did not know but, &s;ome time or other, I might be reduced to a mite, if I did not mend my manners. I therefore applied my&s;elf with great diligence to the offices that were allotted me, and was generally looked upon as the notable&s;t ant in the whole molehill. I was at la&s;t pick|ed up, as I was groaning under a burden, by an unluc|ky cock &s;parrow that lived in the neighborhood, and had before made great depredations upon our common-wealth.</P>
<P>"I then bettered my condition a little, and lived a whole &s;ummer in the &s;hape of a bee; but, being tired with the painful aad penurious life I had undergone in my two la&s;t tran&s;migrations, I fell into the other ex|treme, and turned drone. As I one day headed a party to plunder a hive, we were received &s;o warmly by the &s;warm which defended it, that we were mo&s;t of us left dead upon the &s;pot.</P>

<HEAD>XIII. CHARACTER OF JULIUS CAESAR.</HEAD>
<P>CAESAR was endowed with every great and noble quality that could exalt human nature, and give a man the a&s;cendant in &s;ociety: formed to excel in peace as well as war, provident in council, fearle&s;s in action, and executing what he had re&s;olved with an amazing cele|rity; generous beyond mea&s;ure to his friends, placable to his enemies; and for parts, learning, eloquence, &s;carce inferior to any man. His orations were admired for two qualities, which are &s;eldom found together, &s;trength and elegance. Cicero ranks him among the greate&s;t orators that Rome ever bred: and Quintilian &s;ays, that he &s;poke with the &s;ame force with which he fought; and if he had devoted him&s;elf to the bar, would have been the only man capable of rivaling Cicero. Nor was he a ma&s;ter only of the politer arts, but conver&s;ant al&s;o with the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e and critical parts of learning; and a|mong other works which he publi&s;hed, addre&s;&s;ed two books to Cicero on the analogy of language, or the art of &s;peaking and writing correctly. He was a mo&s;t li|beral patron of wit and learning, where&s;oever they were

found; and out of his love of tho&s;e talents, would rea|dily pardon tho&s;e who had employed them again&s;t him|&s;elf; rightly adjudging, that by making &s;uch men his friends, he &s;hould draw prai&s;es from the &s;ame fountain from which he had been a&s;per&s;ed. His capital pa&s;&s;ions were ambition and love of plea&s;ure; which he indulged in their turns to the greate&s;t exce&s;s: yet the fir&s;t was always predominant; to which he could ea&s;ily &s;acrifice all the charms of the &s;econd, and draw plea&s;ure even from toils and dangers, when they mini&s;tered to his glory. For he thought Tyranny, as Cicero &s;ays, the greate&s;t of godde&s;&s;es; and had freque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tly in his mouth a ver&s;e of Euripides, which expre&s;&s;ed the image of his &s;oul, That if right and virtue were ever to be violated, they were to be violated for the &s;ake of reigning. This was the chief end and purpo&s;e of his life; the &s;cheme that he had formed from his early youth: &s;o that, as Cato truly declared of him, he came with &s;obriety and meditation to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the republic. He u&s;ed to &s;ay, that there were two things nece&s;&s;ary to acquire and to &s;upport power&mdash;&s;oldiers and money; which yet depend mutually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther: with money, there|fore, he provided &s;oldiers, and with &s;oldiers extorted money; and was, of all men, the mo&s;t rapacious in plun|dering both friends and foes; &s;paring neither prince nor &s;tate, nor temple, nor even private per&s;ons, who were known to po&s;&s;e&s;s any &s;hare of trea&s;ure. His great abi|lities would nece&s;&s;arily have made him one of the fir&s;t citizens of Rome; but di&s;daining the condition of a &s;ubject, he could never re&s;t till he had made him&s;elf a monarch. In acting this la&s;t part, his u&s;ual prudence &s;eemed to fail him; as if the height to which he was mounted had turned his head, and made him giddy: for, by a vain o&s;tentation of his power, he de&s;troyed the &s;tability of it; and, as men &s;horten life by living too fa&s;t, &s;o, by an intemperance of reigning, he brought his reign to a violent end.</P>

<HEAD>XIV. ON MISPENT TIME.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS ye&s;terday comparing the indu&s;try of man with that of other creatures; in which I could not but ob|&s;erve, that, notwith&s;tanding we are obliged by duty to
<PB N="61" REF="021451_0060_0FB3F65C1F519400">
keep our&s;elves in con&s;tant employ, after the &s;ame man|ner as inferior animals are prompted to it by in&s;tinct, we fall very &s;hort of them in this particular. We are here the more inexcu&s;able, becau&s;e there is a greater variety of bu&s;ine&s;s to which we may apply our&s;elves. Rea&s;on opens to us a large field of affairs, which other creatures are not capable of. Bea&s;ts of prey, and, I be|lieve, of all other kinds in their natural &s;tate of being, divide their time between action and re&s;t. They are always at work or &s;leep. In &s;hort, their waking hours are wholly taken up in &s;eeking after their food, or in con&s;uming it. The human &s;pecies only, to the great reproach of our natures, are filled with complaints, that "the day hangs heavy or them," that "they do not know what to do with them&s;elves," that "they are at a lo&s;s how to pa&s;s away their time;" with many of the like &s;hameful murmurs, which we often find in the mouths of tho&s;e who are &s;tyled rea&s;onable beings. How mon&s;trous are &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions among creatures who have the labors of the mind, as well as tho&s;e of the body, to furni&s;h them with proper employments; who, be&s;ides the bu&s;ine&s;s of their proper callings and profe&s;|&s;ions, can apply them&s;elves to the duties of religion, to meditation, to the reading of u&s;eful books, to di&s;|cour&s;e; in a word, who may exerci&s;e them&s;elves in the unbounded pur&s;uits of knowledge and virtue, and every hour of their lives make them&s;elves wi&s;er or better than they were before!</P>
<P>After having been taken up for &s;ome time in this cour&s;e of thought, I diverted my&s;elf with a book, ac|cording to my u&s;ual cu&s;tom, in order to unbend my mind before I went to &s;leep. The book I made u&s;e of on this occa&s;ion was Lucian, where I amu&s;ed my thoughts for about an hour among the dialogues of the dead; which in all probability produced the following dream:</P>
<P>I was conveyed, methought, into the entrance of the infernal regions, where I &s;aw Rhadamanthus, one of the judges of the dead, &s;eated on his tribunal. On his left hand &s;tood the keeper of Erebus, on his right the keeper of Ely&s;ium. I was told he &s;at upon women that day, there being &s;everal of the &s;ex lately arrived, who
<PB N="62" REF="021451_0061_0FB3F65D9CC00410">
had not yet their man&s;ions a&s;&s;igned them. I was &s;ur|pri&s;ed to hear him a&s;k every one of them the &s;ame que&s;|tion, namely, What they had been doing? Upon this que&s;tion being propo&s;ed to the whole a&s;&s;embly, they &s;tared one upon another, as not knowing what to an|&s;wer. He then interrogated each of them &s;eparately. Madam, &s;ays he to the fir&s;t of them, you have been up|on the earth about fifty years: what have you been do|ing there all this while? Doing, &s;ays &s;he; really I do not know what I have been doing; I de&s;ire I may have time given me to recollect. After about half an hour's pau&s;e, &s;he told him that &s;he had been playing at crimp; upon which Rhadamanthus beckoned to the keeper on his left hand to take her into cu&s;tody. And you, Ma|dam, &s;ays the judge, that look with &s;uch a &s;oft and lan|gui&s;hing air: I think you &s;et out for this place in your nine-and-twentieth year, what have you been doing all this while? I had a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s on my hands, &s;ays &s;he, being taken up the fir&s;t twelve years of my life in dre&s;&s;ing a jointed baby, and all the remaining part of it in reading plays and romances. Very well, &s;ays he, you have employed your time to good purpo&s;e. Away with her. The next was a plain country-woman: Well, mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;ays Rhadamanthus, and what have you been doing? An't plea&s;e your wor&s;hip, &s;ays &s;he, I did not live quite forty years; and in that time brought my hu&s;band &s;even daughters, made him nine thou&s;and chee&s;es, and left my elde&s;t girl with him to look af|ter his hou&s;e in my ab&s;ence; and who, I may venture to &s;ay, is as pretty a hou&s;ewife as any in the country. Rhadamanthus &s;miled at the &s;implicity of the good wo|man, and ordered the keeper of Ely&s;ium to take her in|to his care. And you, fair lady, &s;ays he, what have you been doing the&s;e five-and-thirty years? I have been doing no hurt, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, &s;aid &s;he. That is well, &s;aid he; but what good have you been doing? The lady was in great confu&s;ion at this que&s;tion; and not knowing what to an&s;wer, the two keepers leaped out to &s;eize her at the &s;ame time; the one took her by the hand to convey her to Ely&s;ium, the other caught hold of her to carry her away to Erebus. But Rhada|manthus ob&s;erving an ingenuous mode&s;ty in her counte|nance
<PB N="63" REF="021451_0062_0FB3F65F1EEF24C8">
and behavior, bid them both let her loo&s;e, and &s;et her a&s;ide for re-examination when he was more at lei&s;ure. An old woman, of a proud and &s;ure look, pre&s;ented her&s;elf next at the bar; and being a&s;ked what &s;he had been doing? Truly, &s;aid &s;he, I lived three|&s;core and ten years in a very wicked world, and was &s;o angry at the behavior of a parcel young flirts, that I pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of my la&s;t years in condemning the follies of the times. I was every day blaming the &s;illy conduct of people about me, in order to deter tho&s;e I conver&s;ed with from falling into the like errors and mi&s;carriages. Very well, &s;ays Rhadamanthus, but did you keep the &s;ame watchful eye over your own actions? Why truly, &s;ays &s;he, I was &s;o taken up with publi&s;hing the faults of others, that I had no time to con&s;ider my own. Ma|dam, &s;ays Rhadamathus, be plea&s;ed to file off to the left, and make room for the venerable matron that &s;tands behind you. Old gentlewoman, &s;ays he, I think you are four&s;core; you have heard the que&s;tion; what have you been doing &s;o long in the world? Ah, Sir, &s;ays &s;he, I have been doing what I &s;hould not have done; but I had made a firm re&s;olution to have changed my life, if I had not been &s;natched off by an untimely end. Madam, &s;ays he, you will plea&s;e to follow your leader: and, &s;pying another of the &s;ame age, interroga|ted her in the &s;ame form. To which the matron re|plied, I have been the wife of a hu&s;band who was as dear to me in his old age as in his youth. I have been a mother, and very happy in my children, whom I en|deavored to bring up in every thing that is good. My elde&s;t &s;on is ble&s;t by the poor, and beloved by every one that knows him. I lived within my own family, and left it much more wealthy than I found it. Rhada|manthus, who knew the value of the old lady, &s;miled upon her in &s;uch a manner, that the keeper of Ely&s;ium, who knew his office, reached out his hand to her. He no &s;ooner touched her, but her wrinkles vani&s;hed, her eyes &s;parkled, her cheeks glowed with blu&s;hes, and &s;he appeared in full bloom and beauty. A young wo|man, ob&s;erving that this officer who conducted the happy to Ely&s;ium, was &s;o great a beautifier, longed to be in his hands; &s;o that, pre&s;&s;ing through the crowd,

&s;he was the next that appeared at the bar: and being a&s;ked what &s;he had been doing the five and twenty years that &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed in the world? I have endeavored, &s;ays &s;he, ever &s;ince I came to years of di&s;cretion, to make my&s;elf lovely, and gain admirers. In order to it, I pa&s;t my time in bottling up May-dew, inventing white|wa&s;hes, mixing colors, cutting out patches, con&s;ulting my gla&s;s, &s;uiting my complexion&mdash;Rhadamanthus, with|out hearing her out, gave the &s;ign to take her off. Upon the approach of the keeper of Erebus, her color faded, herface was puckered up with wrinkles, and her whole per&s;on lo&s;t in deformity.</P>
<P>I was then &s;urpri&s;ed with a di&s;tant &s;ound of a whole troop of females that came forward, laughing, &s;inging, and dancing. I was very de&s;irous to know the recep|tion they would meet with, and withal was very ap|prehen&s;ive that Rhadamanthus would &s;poil their mirth: but at their nearer approach, the noi&s;e grew &s;o very great that it awakened me.</P>
<P>I lay &s;ome time reflecting in my&s;elf on the oddne&s;s of this dream; and could not forbear a&s;king my own heart, what I was doing? I an&s;wered my&s;elf that I was writing GUARDIANS. If my readers make as good a u&s;e of this work as I de&s;ign they &s;hould, I hope it will never be imputed to me as work that is vain and unprofitable.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this paper with recommending to them the &s;ame &s;hort &s;elf-examination. If every one of them frequently lays his hand upon his heart, and con|&s;iders what he is doing, it will check him in all the idle, or, what is wor&s;e, the vicious, moments of life; lift up his mind when it is running on in a &s;eries of indifferent actions, and encourage him when he is engaged in tho&s;e which are virtuous and laudable.

<HEAD>XV. CHARACTER OF FRANCIS I.</HEAD>
<P>FRANCIS died at Rambouillet, on the la&s;t day of March, in the fifty-third year of his age, and the thirty-third of his reign.&mdash;During twenty-eight years of that time, an avowed rival&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and the Em|peror: which involved, not only their own dominions, but the greater part of Europe, in wars, pro&s;ecuted with more violent animo&s;ity, and drawn out to a greater length, than had been known in any former period. Many circum&s;tances contributed to both. Their ani|mo&s;ity was founded in oppo&s;ition of intere&s;t, heightened by per&s;onal emulation, and exa&s;perated, not only by mutual injuries, but by reciprocal in&s;ults. At the &s;ame time, whatever advantage one &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s towards gaining the a&s;cendant, was wonderfully ballanced by &s;ome favorable circum&s;tance peculiar to the other. The Emperor's dominions were of great extent; the French King's lay more compact: Francis governed his king|dom with ab&s;olute power; that of Charles was limited, but he &s;upplied the want of authority by addre&s;s: the troops of the former were more impetuous and enter|pri&s;ing; tho&s;e of the latter, better di&s;ciplined, and more patient of fatigue.</P>
<P>The talents and abilities of the two monarchs were as different as the advantages which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and contributed no le&s;s to prolong the conte&s;t between them. Francis took his re&s;olutions &s;uddenly; pro&s;ecuted them, at fir&s;t, with warmth; and pu&s;hed them into execution with a mo&s;t adventurous courage: but, being de&s;titute of the per&s;everance nece&s;&s;ary to &s;urmount difficulties, he often abandoned his de&s;igns, or relaxed the vigor of pur&s;uit, from impatience, and &s;ometimes from levity. Charles deliberated long, and determined with coolne&s;s: but, having once fixed his plan, he adhered to it with inflexible ob&s;tinacy; and neither danger, nor di&s;courage|ment, could turn him a&s;ide from the execution of it.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of their enterpri&s;es was as different as their characters, and was uniformly influenced by them. Francis, by his impetuous activity, often di&s;concerted the Emperor's be&s;t-laid &s;chemes; Charles, by a more calm, but &s;teady pro&s;ecution of his de&s;igns, checked the
<PB N="66" REF="021451_0065_0FB3F6639FB1D4A0">
rapidity of his rival's career, and baffled or repul&s;ed his mo&s;t vigorous efforts. The former, at the opening of a war or of a campaign, broke in upon his enemy with the violence of a torrent, and carried all before him; the latter, waiting until he &s;aw the force of his rival be|gan to abate, recovered, in the end, not only all that he had lo&s;t, but made new acqui&s;itions. Few of the French monarch's attempts towards conque&s;t, whatever promi|&s;ing a&s;pect they might wear at fir&s;t, were conducted to an happy i&s;&s;ue; many of the Emperor's enterpri&s;es even after they appeared de&s;perate and impracticable, termi|nated in the mo&s;t pro&s;perous manner.</P>
<P>The degree, however, of their comparative merit and reputation, has not been fixed, either by a &s;trict &s;crutiny into their abilities for government, or by an impartial con&s;ideration of the greatne&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s of their under|takings; and Francis is one of tho&s;e monarchs, who occupy a higher rank in the temple of fame, than ei|ther their talents or performances intitle them to hold. This pre-eminence he owed to many different circum|&s;tances. The &s;uperiority which Charles acquired by the victory of Pavia, and which, from that period, he pre|&s;erved through the remainder of his reign, and was &s;o ma|nife&s;t, that Francis's &s;truggle again&s;t his exorbitant and growing dominion, was viewed by mo&s;t of the other powers, not only with the partiality which naturally ari&s;es from tho&s;e who gallantly maintain an unequal con|te&s;t, but with the favor due to one, who was re&s;i&s;ting a common enemy, and endeavoring to &s;et bounds to a monarch equally formidable to them all. The charac|ters of princes, too, e&s;pecially among the cotempo|raries, depend, not only upon their talents for govern|ment, but upon their qualities as men. Francis, not|with&s;tanding the many errors con&s;picuous in his foreign policy and dome&s;tic admini&s;tration, was, neverthele&s;s, humane, beneficent, generous. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed dignity without pride, affability free from meanne&s;s, and cour|te&s;y exempt from deceit. All who had acce&s;s to know him, and no man of merit was ever denied that privilege, re&s;pected and loved him. Captivated with his per&s;onal qualities, his &s;ubjects forgot his defects as a monarch; and, admiring him as the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed and amiable
<PB N="67" REF="021451_0066_0FB3F6651D103750">
gentleman in his dominions, they hardly murmured at acts of mal-admini&s;tration, which, in a prince of le&s;s en|gaging di&s;po&s;itions, would have been deemed unpardon|able.</P>
<P>This admiration, however, mu&s;t have been temporary only, and would have died away with the courtiers who be&s;towed it; the illu&s;ion ari&s;ing from his private virtues mu&s;t have cea&s;ed, and po&s;terity would have judged of his public conduct with its u&s;ual impartiality; but ano|ther circum&s;tance prevented this; and his name hath been tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity with increa&s;ing reputation. Science, and the arts, had, at that time, made little pro|gre&s;s in France. They were ju&s;t beginning to advance beyond the limits of Italy, where they had revived, and which had hitherto been their only &s;eat. Francis took them immediately under his protection, and vied with Leo him&s;elf in the zeal and munificence with which he encouraged them. He invited learned men to his court, he conver&s;ed with them familiarly, he em|ployed them in bu&s;ine&s;s, he rai&s;ed them to offices of dignity, and honored them with his confidence. That race of men, not more prone to complain when denied the re&s;pect to which they fancy them&s;elves intitled, than apt to be plea&s;ed when treated with the di&s;tinction which they con&s;ider as their due, thought they could not exceed in gratitude to &s;uch a benefactor, and &s;trained their invention, and employed all their ingenuity, in panegyric.</P>
<P>Succeeding authors, warmed with their de&s;criptions of Francis's bounty, adopted their encomiums, and re|fined upon them. The appellation of FATHER OF LET|TERS, be&s;towed upon Francis, hath rendered his memory &s;acred among hi&s;torians; and they &s;eem to have regard|ed it as a &s;ort of impiety, to uncover his infirmities, or to point out his defects. Thus Francis, notwith&s;tanding his inferior abilities, and want of &s;ucce&s;s, hath more than equalled the fame of Charles. The virtues which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as a man, have intitled him to greater admira|tion and prai&s;e, than have been be&s;towed upon the ex|ten&s;ive genius, and fortunate arts, of a more capable, but le&s;s amiable rival.</P>

<HEAD>XVI. THE SUPPER AND GRACE.</HEAD>
<P>A SHOE coming loo&s;e from the fore-foot of the thill-hor&s;e, at the beginning of the a&s;cent of mount Taurira, the po&s;tillion di&s;mounted, twi&s;ted the &s;hoe off, and put it in his pocket: as the a&s;cent was of five or &s;ix miles, and that hor&s;e our main dependence, I made a point of having the &s;hoe fa&s;tened on again, as well as we could; but the po&s;tillion had thrown away the nails, and the hammer in the chai&s;e-box being of no great u&s;e without them, I &s;ubmitted to go on.</P>
<P>He had not mounted half a mile higher, when, coming to a flinty piece of road, the poor devil lo&s;t a &s;econd &s;hoe, and from off his other fore-foot. I then got out of the chai&s;e in good earne&s;t; and, &s;eeing a hou&s;e about a quarter of a mile to the left-hand, with a great deal to do I prevailed upon the po&s;tilion to turn up to it. The look of the hou&s;e, and every thing about it, as we drew nearer, &s;oon reconciled me to the di&s;a&s;ter. It was a little farm-hou&s;e, &s;urrounded with about twenty acres of vineyard, about as much corn; and clo&s;e to the hou&s;e, on one &s;ide, was a potagerie of an acre and a half, full of every thing which could make plenty in a French pea&s;ant's hou&s;e: and, on the other &s;ide, was a little wood which furni&s;hed wherewithal to dre&s;s it. It was about eight in the evening when I got to the hou&s;e: &s;o I left the po&s;tillion to manage his point as he could; and, for mine, I walked directly into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The family con&s;i&s;ted of an old gray-headed man and his wife, with five or &s;ix &s;ons and &s;ons-in-law and their &s;everal wives, and a joyous genealogy out of them.</P>
<P>They were all &s;itting down together to their lentil-&s;oup; a large wheaten loaf was in the middle of the table; and a flagon of wine at each end of it promi&s;ed joy through the &s;tages of the repa&s;t&mdash;'twas a fea&s;t of love.</P>
<P>The old man ro&s;e up to meet me, and, with a re&s;pect|ful cordiality, would have me &s;it down at the table. My heart was &s;et down the moment I entered the room: &s;o I &s;at down at once like a &s;on of the family; and to in|ve&s;t my&s;elf in the character as &s;peedily as I could, I in|&s;tantly borrowed the old man's knife, and taking up the
<PB N="69" REF="021451_0068_0FB3F6681DE3B7D8">
loaf, cut my&s;elf a hearty luncheon; and, as I did it, I &s;aw a te&s;timony in every eye, not only of an hone&s;t welcome, but of a welcome mixed with thanks that I had not &s;eemed to doubt it.</P>
<P>Was it this; or tell me, Nature, what el&s;e it was that made this mor&s;el &s;o &s;weet&mdash;and to what magic I owe it, that the draught I took of their flagon was &s;o de|licious with it, that it remains upon my palate to this hour?</P>
<P>If the &s;upper was to my ta&s;te, the grace which fol|lowed was much more &s;o.</P>
<P>When &s;upper was over, the old man gave a knock upon the table with the haft of his knife, to bid them prepare for the dance. The moment the &s;ignal was gi|ven, the women and girls ran altogether into the back apartment to tie up their hair, and the young men to the door to wa&s;h their faces, and change their &s;abots, (WOODEN SHOES;) and in three minutes every &s;oul was ready, upon a little e&s;planade before the hou&s;e, to begin. The old man and his wife came out la&s;t, and placing me betwixt them, &s;at down upon a &s;opha of turf by the door.</P>
<P>The old man had &s;ome fifty years ago been no mean performer upon the vielle; and at the age he was then of, touched it well enough for the purpo&s;e. His wife &s;ung now-and-then a little to the tune, then intermitted, and joined her old man again, as their children and grandchildren danced before them.</P>
<P>It was not till the middle of the &s;econd dance, when, for &s;ome pau&s;es in the movement wherein they all &s;eem|ed to look up, I fancied I could di&s;tingui&s;h an elevation of &s;pirit different from that which is the cau&s;e or the effect of &s;imple jollity. In a word, I thought I beheld religion mixing in the dance; but, as I had never &s;een her &s;o engaged, I &s;hould have looked upon it now as one of the illu&s;ions of an imagination which is eternally mi&s;leading me, had not the old man, as &s;oon as the dance ended, &s;aid, that this was their con&s;tant way; and that all his life long, he made it a rule, after &s;upper was over, to call out his family to dance and rejoice; be|lieving, he &s;aid, that a cheerful and contented mind was the be&s;t &s;ort of thanks to heaven that an illiterate pea|&s;ant could pay.&mdash;Or a learned prelate either, &s;aid I.</P>

A tran&s;ient &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s, &s;uch as is here &s;ketched, how &s;oon does it furni&s;h materials to &s;et the mind at work? how nece&s;|&s;arily does it engage it to the con&s;ideration of the mi|&s;eries and misfortunes, the dangers and calamities, to which the life of man is &s;ubject? By holding up &s;uch a gla&s;s before it, it forces the mind to &s;ee and reflect upon the vanity&mdash;the peri&s;hing condition and uncertain tenure, of every thing in this world. From reflections of this &s;erious ca&s;t, how in&s;en&s;ibly do the thoughts carry us farther?&mdash;and from con&s;idering what we are,&mdash;what kind of world we live in, and what evil befals us in it, how naturally do they &s;et us to look forward at what po&s;&s;ibly we &s;hall be?&mdash;for what kind of world we are intended&mdash;what evils may befal us there&mdash;and what provi&s;ion we &s;hould make again&s;t them here whil&s;t we have time and opportunity?

Turn in hi|ther, I be&s;eech you, for a moment. Behold a dead man ready to be carried out, the only &s;on of his mo|ther, and &s;he a widow. Perhaps a &s;till more affecting &s;pectacle, a kind and indulgent father of a numerous family lies breathle&s;s&mdash;&s;natched away in the &s;trength of his age&mdash;torn in an evil hour from his children and the bo&s;om of a di&s;con&s;olate wife. Behold much people of the city gathered together to mix their tears, with &s;et|tled &s;orrow in their looks, going heavily along to the hou&s;e of mourning, to perform that la&s;t melancholy of|fice, which, when the debt of nature is paid, we are

If this &s;ad occa&s;ion which leads him there, has not done it already, take notice, to what a &s;erious and devout frame of mind e|very man is reduced the moment he enters THIS gate of affliction. The bu&s;y and fluttering &s;pirits, which in the hou&s;e of mirth were wont to tran&s;port him from one di|verting object to another&mdash;&s;ee how they are fallen! how peaceably they are laid!

Every one, without exception, &s;ubmitted to this determination; even the bi&s;hop of Luna, brother to the Cardinal, was not excu&s;ed.

He never O'ERSTEPS THE MO|DESTY OF NATURE, nor rai&s;es merriment or wonder by the violation of truth. His figures neither divert by di&s;|tortion, nor amaze by aggravation. He copies life with &s;o much fidelity, that he can hardly be &s;aid to invent; yet his exhibitions have an air &s;o much original, that it is difficult to &s;uppo&s;e them not merely the product of imagination.</P>
<P>As a teacher of wi&s;dom, he may be confidently fol|lowed. His religion has nothing in it enthu&s;ia&s;tic or &s;uper&s;titious; he appears neither weakly credulous nor wantonly &s;ceptical; his morality is neither dangerou&s;ly lax, nor implacably rigid.

<P>THERE were two families, which, from the beginning of the world, were as oppo&s;ite to each other as light and darkne&s;s. The one of them lived in heaven, and the other in hell. The younge&s;t de&s;cendant of the fir&s;t fa|mily was Plea&s;ure; who was the daughter of Hap|pine&s;s, who was the child of Virtue, who was the off|&s;pring of the Gods. The&s;e, as I &s;aid before, had their habitation in heaven. The younge&s;t of the oppo&s;ite fa|mily was Pain; who was the &s;on of Mi&s;ery, who wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the child of Vice, who was the offspring of the Furies. The habitation of this race of beings was in hell.</P>
<P>The middle &s;tation of nature between the&s;e two op|po&s;ite extremes was the earth, which was inhabited by creatures of a middle kind; neither &s;o virtuous as the one, nor &s;o vicious as the other, but partaking of the good and bad qualities of the&s;e two oppo&s;ite families. Jupiter, con&s;idering that this &s;pecies, commonly called MAN, was too virtuous to be mi&s;erable, and too vicious to be happy, that he might make a di&s;tinction between the good and the bad, ordered the two younge&s;t of the
<PB N="76" REF="021451_0075_0FB3F6729E03CAC8">
above mentioned families (Plea&s;ure, who was the daugh|ter of Happine&s;s; and Pain, who was the &s;on of Mi&s;e|ry) to meet one another upon this part of nature; ha|ving promi&s;ed to &s;ettle it upon them both, provided they could agree upon the divi&s;ion of it, &s;o as to &s;hare man|kind between them.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ure and Pain were no &s;ooner met in their new habitation, but they immediately agreed upon this point. That Plea&s;ure &s;hould take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the virtuous, and Pain of the vicious part of that &s;pecies which was given up to them. But, upon examining to which of them any individual they met with belonged, they found each of them had a right to him; for that, contrary to what they had &s;een in their old places of re&s;idence, there was no per&s;on &s;o vicious who had not &s;ome good in him, nor any per&s;on &s;o virtuous who had not in him &s;ome evil. The truth of it is, they generally found, upon &s;earch, that in the mo&s;t vicious man, Plea&s;ure might lay claim to an hundredth part, and that in the mo&s;t virtuous man Pain might come in for at lea&s;t two thirds.. This they &s;aw would occa&s;ion endle&s;s di&s;putes between them, unle&s;s they could come to &s;ome accommodation. To this end, there was a marriage propo&s;ed between them, and at length concluded. Hence it is that we find Plea&s;ure and Pain are &s;uch con&s;tant yoke-fellows, and that they either make their vi&s;its together, or are never far a&s;under. If Pain comes into a heart, he is quickly followed by Plea&s;ure; and if Plea&s;ure enters, you may be &s;ure Pain is not far off.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this marriage was very conve|nient for the two parties, it did not &s;eem to an&s;wer the intention of Jupiter in &s;ending them among mankind. To remedy, therefore, this inconvenience, it was &s;ti|pulated between them by article, and confirmed by the con&s;ent of each family, that, notwith&s;tanding they here po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the place indifferently, upon the death of every per&s;on, if he were fond to have in him a certain pro|portion of evil, he &s;hould be di&s;patched into the infernal regions by a pa&s;&s;port from Pain, there to dwell with Mi|&s;ery, Vice, and the Furies; or, on the contrary, if he had in him a certain proportion of good, he &s;hould be

di&s;patched into heaven by a pa&s;&s;port from Plea&s;ure, there to dwell with happine&s;s, Virtue, and the Gods.</P>

<HEAD>V. SIR ROGER DE COVERLY'S FAMILY.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING often received an invitation from my friend Sir Roger de Coverly to pa&s;s away a month with him in the country, I la&s;t week accompanied him thi|ther, and am &s;ettled with him for &s;ome time at his country-hou&s;e, where I intend to form &s;everal of my en|&s;uing &s;peculations. Sir Roger, who is very well ac|quainted with my humor, lets me ri&s;e and go to bed when I plea&s;e, dine at his own table or in the chamber as I think fit, &s;it &s;till and &s;ay nothing without bidding me be merry. When the gentlemen of the country come to &s;ee him, he only &s;hows me at a di&s;tance. As I have been walking in his fields, I have ob&s;erved them &s;teal|ing a &s;ight of me over the hedge, and have heard the knight de&s;iring them not to let me &s;ee them, for that I hated to be &s;tared at.</P>
<P>I am the more at ea&s;e in Sir Roger's family, becau&s;e it con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ober and &s;taedy per&s;ons; for as the knight is the be&s;t ma&s;ter in the world, he &s;eldom changes his &s;er|vants; and as he is beloved by all about him, his &s;er|vants never care for leaving him; by which means his do|me&s;tics are all in years, and grown old with their ma|&s;ter. You would take his valet-de-chambre for his bro|ther, his butler is gray-headed, his groom is one of the grave&s;t men I have ever &s;een, and his coachman has the looks of a privy-coun&s;ellor. You &s;ee the goodne&s;s of the ma&s;ter even in the old hou&s;e-dog, and in a gray pad that is kept in the &s;table with great care and tenderne&s;s out of regard to his pa&s;t &s;ervices, though he has been u&s;e|le&s;s for &s;everal years.</P>
<P>I could not but ob&s;erve, with a great deal of plea&s;ure, the joy that appeared in the countenances of the&s;e an|cient dome&s;tics upon my friend's arrival at his country-&s;eat. Some of them could not refrain from tears at the &s;ight of their old ma&s;ter; every one of them pre&s;&s;ed for|ward to do &s;omething for him, and &s;eemed di&s;couraged if they were not employed. At the &s;ame time the good old knight, with a mixture of the father and the ma&s;ter of the family, tempered the inquiries after his own af|fairs
<PB N="78" REF="021451_0077_0FB3F6759D1A7C38">
with &s;everal kind que&s;tions relating to them&s;elves. This humanity and good-nature engages every body to him; &s;o that when he is plea&s;ant upon any of them, all his family are in good humor, and none &s;o much as the per&s;on whom he diverts him&s;elf with: on the contrary, if he coughs, or betrays any infirmity of old age, it is ea&s;y for a &s;tander-by, to ob&s;erve a &s;ecret concern in the looks of all his &s;ervants.</P>
<P>My worthy friend has put me under the particular care of his butler, who is a very prudent man, and, as well as the re&s;t of his fellow-&s;ervants, wonderfully de&s;i|rous of plea&s;ing me, becau&s;e they have often heard their ma&s;ter talk of me as of his particular friend.</P>
<P>My chief companion, when Sir Roger is diverting him&s;elf in the woods or the fields, is a very venerable man, who is ever with Sir Roger, and has lived at his hou&s;e, in the nature of a chaplain above thirty years. This gentleman is a per&s;on of good &s;en&s;e and &s;ome learn|ing, of a very regular life and obliging conver&s;ation: he heartily loves Sir Roger, and knows that he is very much in the old knight's e&s;teem; &s;o that he lives in the family rather as a relation than a dependant.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved in &s;everal of my papers, that my friend Sir Roger, amid&s;t all his good qualities, is &s;ome|thing of a humori&s;t; and that his virtues, as well as imperfections, are as it were tinged by a certain extra|vagance, which makes them particularly HIS, and di&s;|tingui&s;hes them from tho&s;e of other men. This ca&s;t of mind, as it is generally very innocent in it&s;elf, &s;o it renders his conver&s;ation highly agreeable, and more de|lightful than the &s;ame degre of &s;en&s;e and virtue would appear in their common and ordinary colors. As I was walking with him la&s;t night, he a&s;ked me how I li|ked the good man whom I have ju&s;t now mentioned? and, without &s;taying for my an&s;wer, told me, that he was afraid of being in&s;ulted with Latin and Greek at his own table; for which rea&s;on he de&s;ired a particular friend of his at the univer&s;ity to find him out a clergy|man rather of plain &s;en&s;e than much learning, of a good a&s;pect, a clear voice, a &s;ociable temper; and, if po&s;|&s;ible, a man that under&s;tood a little of back-gammon. My friend, &s;ays Sir Roger, found me out this gentle|man;
<PB N="79" REF="021451_0078_0FB3F6771D4FDC48">
who, be&s;ides the endowments required of him, is, they tell me, a good &s;cholar, though he does not &s;how it. I have given him the par&s;onage of the pari&s;h; and becau&s;e I know his value, have &s;ettled upon him a good annuity for life. If he outlives me, he &s;hall find that he was higher in my e&s;teem than perhaps he thinks he is. He has now been with me thirty years; and though he does not know I have taken notice of it, has never in all that time a&s;ked any thing of me for him&s;elf, though he is every day &s;oliciting me for &s;omething in behalf of one or other of my tenants his pari&s;hioners. There has not been a law-&s;uit in the pari&s;h &s;ince he has lived among them. If any di&s;pute ari&s;es, they apply them|&s;elves to him for the deci&s;ion: if they do not acquie&s;ce in his judgment, which I think never happened above once or twice at mo&s;t, they appeal to me. At his fir&s;t &s;ettling with me, I made him a pre&s;ent of all the good &s;ermons which have been printed in Engli&s;h; and only begged of him, that every Sunday he would pronounce one of them in the pulpit. Accordingly he has dige&s;ted them into &s;uch a &s;eries, that they follow one another naturally, and make a continued &s;y&s;tem of practical divinity.</P>
<P>As Sir Roger was going on in his &s;tory, the gentle|man we were talking of came up to us; and upon the Knight's a&s;king him who preached to-morrow (for it was Saturday night,) told us the Bi&s;hop of St A&s;aph in the morning, and Dr South in the afternoon. He then &s;howed us his li&s;t of preachers for the whole year; where I &s;aw, with a great deal of plea&s;ure, Archbi&s;hop Tillot&s;on, Bi&s;hop Saunder&s;on, Dr Barrow, Dr Calamy, with &s;everal living authors who have publi&s;hed di&s;cour|&s;es of practical divinity. I no &s;ooner &s;aw this venerable man in the pulpit, but I very much approved of my friend's in&s;i&s;ting upon the qualifications of a good a&s;pect and a clear voice; for I was &s;o charmed with the grace|fulne&s;s of his figure and delivery, as well as with the di&s;cour&s;es he pronounced, that I think I never pa&s;&s;ed any time more to my &s;atisfaction. A &s;ermon repeated after this manner, is like the compo&s;ition of a poet in the mouth of a graceful actor.</P>

<HEAD>VI. THE FOLLY OF INCONSISTENT EXPECTATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS world may be con&s;idered as a great mart of commerce, where fortune expo&s;es to our view va|rious commodities, riches, ea&s;e, tranquillity, fame, in|tegrity, knowledge. Every thing is marked at a &s;ettled price. Our time, our labor, our ingenuity, is &s;o much ready money which we are to lay out to the be&s;t advan|tage. Examine, compare, choo&s;e, reject: but &s;tand to your own judgment; and do not, like children, when you have purcha&s;ed one thing, repine that you do not po&s;&s;e&s;s another which you did not purcha&s;e. Such is the force of well-regulated indu&s;try, that a &s;teady and vigorous exertion of our faculties, directed to one end, will ge|nerally in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. Would you, for in&s;tance, be rich? Do you think that &s;ingle point worth the &s;acrificing every thing el&s;e to? You may then be rich. Thou|&s;ands have become &s;o from the lowe&s;t beginnings, by toil, and patient diligence, and attention to the minute&s;t ar|ticles of expence and profit. But you mu&s;t give up the plea&s;ures of lei&s;ure, of a vacant mind, of a free un&s;u&s;pi|cious temper. If you pre&s;erve your integrity, it mu&s;t be a coar&s;e-&s;pun and vulgar hone&s;ty. Tho&s;e high and lofty notions of morals which you brought with you from the &s;chools mu&s;t be con&s;iderably lowered, and mixed with the ba&s;er alloy of a jealous and worldly-minded pru|dence. You mu&s;t learn to do hard, if not unju&s;t things; and, for the nice embarra&s;&s;ments of a delicate and inge|nuous &s;pirit, it is nece&s;&s;ary for you to get rid of them as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. You mu&s;t &s;hut your heart again&s;t the mu&s;es, and be content to feed your under&s;tanding with plain hou&s;ehold truth. In &s;hort, you mu&s;t not attempt to enlarge your ideas, or poli&s;h your ta&s;te, or refine your &s;entiments; but mu&s;t keep on in one beaten track, with|out turning a&s;ide either to the right hand or to the left.&mdash; "But I cannot &s;ubmit to drudgery like this&mdash;I feel a &s;pirit above it." 'Tis well: be above it then; only do not repine that you are not rich.</P>
<P>Is knowledge the pearl of price? That, too, may be purcha&s;ed&mdash;by &s;teady application, and long &s;olitary hours of &s;tudy and reflection. Be&s;tow the&s;e, and you &s;hall be learned. "But," &s;ay the man of letters, "what a hard|&s;hip

is it, that many an illiterate fellow, who cannot con|&s;true the motto of the arms of his coach, &s;hall rai&s;e a for|tune and make a figure, while I have little more than the common conveniences of life!" Was it in order to rai&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a fortune that you con&s;umed the &s;prightly hours of youth in &s;tudy and retirement? Was it to be rich that you grew pale over the midnight-lamp, and di&s;tilled the &s;weetne&s;s from the Greek and Roman &s;pring? You have then mi&s;taken your path, and ill employed your indu|&s;try. "What reward have I then for all my labors?" What reward! A large comprehen&s;ive &s;oul, well pur|ged from vulgar fears, and perturbations, and prejudices; able to comprehend and interpret the works of man&mdash; of God.

A perpetual &s;pring of fre&s;h ideas, and the con&s;ciou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> dig|nity of &s;uperior intelligence. Good Heaven! and what reward can you a&s;k be&s;ides?</P>
<P>"But is it not &s;ome reproach upon the oeconomy of Providence that &s;uch a one, who is a mean dirty fellow, &s;hould have ama&s;&s;ed wealth enough to buy half a nation?" Not in the lea&s;t. He made him&s;elf a mean dirty fellow for that very end. He has paid his health, his con|&s;cience, his liberty, for it; and will you envy his bar|gain? Will you hang your head and blu&s;h in his pre|&s;ence, becau&s;e he out&s;hines you in equipage and &s;how? Lift up your brow with a noble confidence, and &s;ay to your&s;elf, "I have not the&s;e things, it is true; but it is becau&s;e I have not &s;ought, becau&s;e I have not de&s;ired them; it is becau&s;e I po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;omething better: I have cho&s;en my lot; I am content and &s;atisfied."</P>
<P>You are a mode&s;t man&mdash;you love quiet and indepen|dence, and have a delicacy and re&s;erve in your temper which renders it impo&s;&s;ible for you to elbow your way in the world, and be the herald of your own merits.

<HEAD>VII. DESCRIPTION OF THE VALE OF KESWICK IN CUMBERLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THIS delightful vale is thus elegantly de&s;cribed by the late ingenious Dr Brown, in a letter to a friend.</P>
<P>In my way to the north from Hagley, I pa&s;&s;ed through Dovedale; and, to &s;ay the truth, was di&s;ap|pointed in it. When I came to Buxton, I vi&s;ited ano|ther or two of their romantic &s;cenes; but the&s;e are infe|rior to Dovedale. They are all but poor miniatures of Ke&s;wick; which exceeds them more in grandeur than you can imagine; and more, if po&s;&s;ible, in beauty than in grandeur.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of the narrow &s;lip of valley which is &s;een at Dovedale, you have at Ke&s;wick a va&s;t amphitheatre, in circumference above twenty miles. In&s;tead of a meagre rivulet, a noble living-lake, ten miles round, of an ob|long form, adorned with a variety of wooded i&s;lands. The rocks indeed of Dovedale are finely wild, pointed, and irregular; but the hills are both little and unanima|ted; and the margin of the brook is poorly edged with weeds, mora&s;s, and bru&s;hwood. But at Ke&s;wick, you will, on one &s;ide of the lake, &s;ee a rich and beautiful land&s;cape of cultivated fields, ri&s;ing to the eye in fine in|equalities, with noble groves of oak, happily di&s;per&s;ed,
<PB N="83" REF="021451_0082_0FB3F67D23169310">
and climbing the adjacent hills, &s;hade above &s;hade, in the mo&s;t various and picture&s;que forms. On the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, you will find rocks and cliffs of &s;tupendous height, hanging broken over the lake in horrible grandeur, &s;ome of them a thou&s;and feet high, the woods climbing up their &s;teep and &s;haggy &s;ides, where mortal foot never yet approached. On the&s;e dreadful heights the eagles build their ne&s;ts; a variety of water-falls are &s;een pouring from their &s;ummits, and tumbling in va&s;t &s;heets from rock to rock in a rude and terrible magnificence: while on all &s;ides of this immen&s;e amphitheatre the lofty moun|tains ri&s;e round; piercing the clouds in &s;hapes as &s;piry and fanta&s;tic as the very rocks of Dovedale. To this I mu&s;t add the frequent and bold projection of the cliffs into the lake, forming noble bays and promontories: in other parts they finely retire from it, and often open in ab|rupt cha&s;ms or clefts, through which at hand you &s;ee rich and uncultivated vales; and beyond the&s;e, at va|rious di&s;tance, mountain ri&s;ing over mountain; among which, new pro&s;pects pre&s;ents them&s;elves in mi&s;t, till the eye is lo&s;t in an agreeable perplexity;
<Q><L>Where active fancy travels beyond &s;en&s;e,</L>
<L>And pictures things un&s;een.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>Were I to analy&s;e the two places in their con&s;tituent principles, I &s;hould tell you, that the full perfection of Ke&s;wick con&s;i&s;ts of three circum&s;tances; beauty, horror, and immen&s;ity, united; the &s;econd of which alone is found in Dovedale. Of beauty it hath little, nature having left it almo&s;t a de&s;ert: neither its &s;mall extent, nor the diminutive and lifele&s;s form of the hills, admit magnificence; but to give you a complete idea of the&s;e three perfections, as they are joined in Ke&s;wick, would require the united powers of Claude, Salvator, and Pou&s;|&s;in. The fir&s;t &s;hould throw his delicate &s;un&s;hine over the cultivated vales, the &s;cattered cots, the groves, the lake, and wooded i&s;lands&punc; the &s;econd &s;hould da&s;h out the horror of the rugged cliffs, the &s;teeps, the hanging woods, and foaming water-falls; while the grand pencil of Pou&s;&s;in &s;hould crown the whole with the maje&s;ty of the impending mountains.</P>
<P>So much for what I would call the permanent beau|ties of this a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cene. Were I not afraid of be|ing
<PB N="84" REF="021451_0083_0FB3F67E9D68C348">
tire&s;ome, I could now dwell as long on its varying or accidental beauties. I would &s;ail round the lake, an|chor in every bay, and land you in every promontory and i&s;land. I would point out the perpetual change of pro&s;pect; the woods, rocks, cliffs, and mountains, by turns vani&s;hing or ri&s;ing into view: now gaining on the &s;ight, hanging over our heads in their full dimen&s;ions, beautifully dreadful: and now, by a change of &s;ituation, a&s;&s;uming new romantic &s;hapes; retiring and le&s;&s;ening on the eye, and in&s;en&s;ibly lo&s;ing them&s;elves in an azure mi&s;t. I would remark the contra&s;t of light and &s;hade, produced by the morning and evening &s;un; the one gilding the we&s;tern, the other the ea&s;tern, &s;ide of this immen&s;e amphitheatre; while the va&s;t &s;hadow projected by the mountains buries the oppo&s;ite part in a deep and purple gloom, which the eye can hardly penetrate. The natural variety of coloring which the &s;everal objects produce, is no le&s;s wonderful and plea&s;ing: the ruling tints in the valley being tho&s;e of azure, green, and gold; yet ever various, ari&s;ing from an intermixture of the lake, the woods, the gra&s;s, and corn-fields: the&s;e are finely contra&s;ted by the gray rocks and cliffs; and the whole heightened by the yellow &s;treams of light, the purple hues and mi&s;ty azure of the mountains. Some|times a &s;erene air and clear &s;ky di&s;clo&s;e the tops of the highe&s;t hills; at other times, you &s;ee the clouds involving their &s;ummits, re&s;ting on their &s;ides, or de&s;cending to their ba&s;e, and rolling among the valleys, as in a va&s;t furnace. When the winds are high, they roar among the cliffs and caverns like peals of thunder; then, too, the clouds are &s;een in va&s;t bodies &s;weeping along the hills in gloomy greatne&s;s, while the lake joins the tumult, and to&s;&s;es like a &s;ea. But, in calm weather, the whole &s;cen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> becomes new: the lake is a perfect mirror, and the land|&s;cape in all its beauty: i&s;lands, fields, woods, rocks, and mountains, are &s;een inverted, and floating on its &s;urface. I will now carry you to the top of a cliff, where, if you dare approach the ridge, a new &s;cene of a&s;toni&s;hment pre&s;ents it&s;elf; where the valley, lake, and i&s;lands, &s;eem lying at your feet; where this expan&s;e of water appears dimini&s;hed to a little pool, amid&s;t the va&s;t and immea&s;urable objects that &s;urround it; for here the

&s;ummits of more di&s;tant hills appear beyond tho&s;e you have already &s;een; and, ri&s;ing behind each other in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive ranges and azure groups of craggy and broken &s;teeps, form an immen&s;e and awful picture, which can only be expre&s;&s;ed by the image of a tempe&s;tuous &s;ea of mountains. Let me now conduct you down again to the valley, and conclude with one circum&s;tance more; which is, that a walk by &s;till moon-light (at which time the di&s;tant water-falls are heard in all their variety of &s;ound) among the&s;e enchanting dales, opens &s;uch &s;cenes of de|licate beauty, repo&s;e, and &s;olemnity, as exceed all de|&s;cription.</P>

<P>IN the happy period of the golden age, when all the cele&s;tial inhabitants de&s;cended to the earth, and conver&s;|ed familiarly with mortals, among the mo&s;t cheri&s;hed of the heavenly powers, were twins, the offspring of Jupiter, LOVE and JOY. Wherever they appeared, the flowers &s;prung up beneath their feet, the &s;un &s;hone with a brighter radiance, and all nature &s;eemed embelli&s;hed by their pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>They were in&s;eparable companions; and their grow|ing attachment was favored by Jupiter, who had de|creed, that a la&s;ting union &s;hould be &s;olemnized between them &s;o &s;oon as they were arrived at maturer years. But, in the mean time, the &s;ons of men deviated from their native innocence; vice and ruin over-ran the earth with giant &s;trides; and A&s;trea, with her train of cele|&s;tial vi&s;itants, for&s;ook their polluted abodes. Love alone remained, having been &s;tolen away by Hope, who was his nur&s;e, and conveyed by her to the fore&s;ts of Arca|dia, where he was brought up among the &s;hepherds. But Jupiter a&s;&s;igned him a different partner, and com|manded him to e&s;pou&s;e SORROW the daughter of At&egrave;. He complied with reluctance; for her features were har&s;h and di&s;agreeable, her eyes &s;unk, her forehead con|tracted into perpetual wrinkles, and her temples were covered with a wreath of cypre&s;s and wormwood.</P>
<P>From this union &s;prung a virgin, in whom might be traced a &s;trong re&s;emblance to both her parents; but the &s;ullen and unamiable features of her mother were &s;o
<PB N="86" REF="021451_0085_0FB3F6819D8A1E58">
mixed and blended with the &s;weetne&s;s of her father, that her countenance, though mournful, was highly plea&s;ing. The maids and &s;hepherds of the neighboring plains gathered round, and called her PITY. A red-brea&s;t was ob&s;erved to build in the cabin where &s;he was born: and, while &s;he was yet an infant, a dove, pur|&s;ued by a hawk, flew into her bo&s;om. This nymph had a dejected appearance; but &s;o &s;oft and gentle a mien, that &s;he was beloved to a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m. Her voice was low and plaintive, but inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;weet; and &s;he loved to lie, for hours together, on the banks of &s;ome wild and melancholy &s;tream, &s;inging to her lute. She taught men to weep, for &s;he took a &s;trange delight in tears; and often, when the virgins of the hamlet were a&s;&s;embled at their evening &s;ports, &s;he would &s;teal in among&s;t them, and captivate their hearts by her tales, full of a charming &s;adne&s;s. She wore on her head a garland, compo&s;ed of her father's myrtles, twi&s;ted with her mother's cypre&s;s.</P>
<P>One day, as &s;he &s;at mu&s;ing by the waters of Heli|con, her tears by chance fell into the fountain; and ever &s;ince, the Mu&s;e's &s;pring has retained a &s;trong ta&s;te of the infu&s;ion. Pity was commanded by Jupiter to fol|low the &s;teps of her mother through the world, drop|ping balm into the wounds &s;he made, and binding up the hearts &s;he had broken. She follows with her hair loo&s;e, her bo&s;om bare and throbbing, her garments torn by the briars, and her feet bleeding with the roughne&s;s of the path. The nymph is mortal, for her mother is &s;o; and when &s;he hes fulfilled her de&s;tined cour&s;e upon the earth, they &s;hall both expire together, and LOVE be again united to JOY, his immortal and long-betrothed bride.</P>

<HEAD>IX. ADVANTAGES OF COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no place in town which I &s;o much love to frequent as the Royal Exchange. It gives me a &s;ecret &s;atisfaction, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure gratifies my va|nity as an Engli&s;hman, to &s;ee &s;o rich an a&s;&s;embly of my countrymen and foreigners con&s;ulting together upon the private bu&s;ine&s;s of mankind, and making this metropolis a kind of emporium for the whole earth. I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s,
<PB N="87" REF="021451_0086_0FB3F6831BED5E48">
I look upon High Change to be a grand council, in which all con&s;iderable nations have their repre&s;entatives. Factors, in the trading world, are what amba&s;&s;adors are in the politic world. They negociate affairs, conclude treaties, and maintain a good corre&s;pondence between tho&s;e wealthy &s;ocieties of men that are divided from one another by &s;eas and oceans, or live on the different ex|tremities of a continent. I have often been plea&s;ed to hear di&s;putes adju&s;ted between an inhabitant of Japan and an alderman of London, or to &s;ee a &s;ubject of the Great Mogul entering into a league with one of the Czar of Mu&s;covy. I am infinitely delighted in mixing with the&s;e &s;everal mini&s;ters of commerce, as they are di&s;|tingui&s;hed by their different walks and different lan|guages. Sometimes I am jo&s;tled among a body of Ar|menians; &s;ometimes I am lo&s;t in a crowd of Jews; and &s;ometimes make one in a group of Dutchmen. I am a Dane, a Swede, or Frenchman, at different times; or rather fancy my&s;elf like the old philo&s;opher, who, upon being a&s;ked what countryman he was, replied, That he was a citizen of the world.</P>
<P>Nature &s;eemes to have taken a particular care to di&s;&s;e|minate her ble&s;&s;ings among the different regions of the world, with an eye to this mutual intercour&s;e and traf|fic among mankind, that the natives of the &s;everal parts of the globe might have a kind of dependence upon one another, and be united together by their common inte|re&s;ts. Almo&s;t every degree produces &s;omething peculiar to it. The food often grows in one country and the &s;auce in another. The fruits of Portugal are corrected by the products of Barbadoes; the infu&s;ion of a China plant &s;weetened with the pith of an Indian cane. The Philippine i&s;lands give a flavor to our European bowls. The &s;ingle dre&s;s of a woman of quality is often the pro|duct of an hundred climates. The muff and the fan come together from the different ends of the earth. The &s;carf is &s;ent from the torrid zone, and the tippet from beneath the pole. The brocade petticoat ri&s;es out of the mines of Peru, and the diamond necklace out of the bowels of Ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tan.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider our own country in its natural pro&s;pect, without any of the benefits and advantages of commerce,
<PB N="88" REF="021451_0087_0FB3F6849EB09528">
what a barren uncomfortable &s;pot of earth falls to our &s;hare? Natural hi&s;torians tell us, that no fruit grows ori|ginally among us be&s;ides hips and haws, acorns and pig-nuts, with other delicacies of the like nature: that our climate, of it&s;elf, and without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of art, can make no farther advances towards a plum than a &s;loe, and carries an apple to no greater perfection than a crab: that our melons, our peaches, our figs, our apri|cots, and our cherries, are &s;trangers among us, import|ed in different ages, and naturalized in our Engli&s;h gar|dens; and that they would all degenerate and fall away into the tra&s;h of our own country, if they were wholly neglected by the planter, and left to the mercy of our &s;un and &s;oil.</P>
<P>Nor has traffic more enriched our vegetable world than it has improved the whole face of nature among us. Our &s;hips are laden with the harve&s;t of every climate; our tables are &s;tored with &s;pices, and oils, and wines; our rooms are filled with pyramids of china, and adorn|ed with the workman&s;hip of Japan; our morning's draught comes from the remote&s;t corners of the earth: we repair our bodies by the drugs of America, and repo&s;e our&s;elves under Indian canopies. My friend Sir Andrew calls the vineyards of France our gardens; the &s;pice-i&s;lands, our hot-beds; the Per&s;ians, our &s;ilk-weavers; and the Chine&s;e, our potters. Nature, indeed, furni&s;hes us with the bare nece&s;&s;aries of life; but traffic gives us a great variety of what is u&s;eful, and at the &s;ame time &s;upplies us with every thing that is convenient and ornamental. Nor is it the lea&s;t part of this our happine&s;s, that, while we enjoy the remote&s;t products of the north and &s;outh, we are free from tho&s;e extremities of weather which give them birth; that our eyes are refre&s;hed with the green fields of Britain, at the &s;ame time that our palates are fea&s;ted with fruits that ri&s;e between the tropics.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, there are not more u&s;eful members in a commonwealth than merchants. They knit man|kind together in a mutual intercour&s;e of good offices, di|&s;tribute the gifts of nature, find work for the poor, add wealth to the rich, and magnificence to the great.

<HEAD>X. ON PUBLIC SPEAKING.</HEAD>
<P>MOST foreign writers who have given any charac|ter of the Engli&s;h nation, whatever vices they a&s;cribe to it, allow, in general, that the people are naturally mode&s;t. It proceeds, perhaps, from this our national virtue, that our orators are ob&s;erved to make u&s;e of le&s;s ge&s;ture or action than tho&s;e of other countries. Our preachers &s;tand &s;tock-&s;till in the pulpit, and will not &s;o much as move a finger to &s;et off the be&s;t &s;ermons in the world. We meet with the &s;ame &s;peaking &s;tatues at our bars, and in all public places of debate. Our words flow from us in a &s;mooth continued &s;tream, without tho&s;e &s;trainings of the voice, motions of the body, and maje&s;ty of the hand, which are &s;o much celebrated in the orators of Greece and Rome. We can talk of life and death in cold blood, and keep our temper in a di&s;cour&s;e which turns upon every thing that is dear to us. Though our zeal breaks out in the fine&s;t tropes and figures, it is not able to &s;tir a limb about us.</P>
<P>It is certain that proper ge&s;tures and exertions of the voice cannot be too much &s;tudied by a public orator. They are a kind of comment to what he utters; and enforce every thing he &s;ays, with weak hearers, better than the &s;tronge&s;t argument he can make u&s;e of. They keep the audience awake, and fix their attention to what is deli|vered to them; at the &s;ame time that they &s;how the &s;peaker is in earne&s;t, and affected him&s;elf with what he &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately recommends to others.</P>
<P>We are told, that the great Latin orator very much impaired his health by the vehemence of action with which he u&s;ed to deliver him&s;elf. The Greek orator was likewi&s;e &s;o very famous for this particular in rheto|ric, that one of his antagoni&s;ts, whom he had bani&s;hed from Athens, reading over the oration which had pro|cured his bani&s;hment, and &s;eeing his friends admire it, could not forbear a&s;king them, If they were &s;o much affected by the bare reading of it, how much more they
<PB N="90" REF="021451_0089_0FB3F6879DAA67F8">
would have been alarmed, had they heard him actually throwing out &s;uch a &s;torm of eloquence?</P>
<P>How cold and dead a figure, in compari&s;on of the&s;e two great men, does an orator often make at the Briti&s;h bar, holding up his head with the mo&s;t in&s;ipid &s;erenity, and &s;troking the &s;ides of a long wig that reaches down to his middle? Nothing can be more ridiculous than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tures of mo&s;t of our Engli&s;h &s;peakers. You &s;ee &s;om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of them running their hands into their pockets as far as ever they can thru&s;t them, and others looking with great attention on a piece of paper that has nothing writ|ten on it: you may &s;ee many a &s;mart rhetorician turn|ing his hat in his hands, moulding it into &s;everal differ|ent cocks, examining &s;ometimes the lining of it, and &s;ometimes the button, during the whole cour&s;e of his harangue. A deaf man would think he was cheapen|ing a beaver, when perhaps he is talking of the fate of the Briti&s;h nation. I remember, when I was a young man, and u&s;ed to frequent We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, there was a coun&s;ellor who never pleaded without a piece of pack|thread in his hand, which he u&s;ed to twi&s;t about a thumb or finger all the while he was &s;peaking: the wags of tho&s;e days u&s;ed to call it the thread of his di&s;cour&s;e, for he was not able to utter a word without it. One of his clients, who was more merry than wi&s;e, &s;tole it from him one day in the mid&s;t of his pleading; but he had better have let it alone, for he lo&s;t his cau&s;e by the e&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>XI. THE INDIAN AND BRITISH OFFICER.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the la&s;t war in America, a company of the Delaware Indians attacked a &s;mall detachment of the Briti&s;h troops, and defeated them. As the Indians had greatly the advantage of &s;wiftne&s;s of foot, and were eager in the pur&s;uit, very few of the fugitives e&s;caped; and tho&s;e who fell into the enemy's hands were treated with a cruelty of which there are not many examples even in that country. Two of the Indians came up with a young officer, and attacked him with great fury. As they were armed with a kind of battle-axe, which they call a tomahawk, he had no hope of e|&s;cape, and thought only of &s;elling his life as dearly as
<PB N="91" REF="021451_0090_0FB3F6891D3639C8">
he could: but ju&s;t at this cri&s;is another Indian came up, who &s;eemed to be advanced in years, and was armed with a bow and arrows. The old man in&s;tantly drew his bow; but after having taken his aim at the officer, he &s;uddenly dropped the point of his arrow, and interpo&s;ed between him and his pur&s;uers, who were about to cut him in pieces. They retired with re&s;pect. The old man then took the officer by the hand, &s;oothed him into confidence by care&s;&s;es; and, having conducted him to his hut, treated him with a kindne&s;s which did honor to his profe&s;&s;ions. He made him le&s;s a &s;lave than a companion, taught him the language of the country, and in&s;tructed him in the rude arts that are practi&s;ed by the inhabitants. They lived together in the mo&s;t cordial amity; and the young officer found nothing to regret, but that &s;ometimes the old man fixed his eyes upon him, and, having regarded him for &s;ome minutes with a &s;teady and &s;ilent attention, bur&s;t into tears. In the mean time the &s;pring returned; and the Indians having recour&s;e to their arms, again took the field. The old man, who was &s;till vigorous, and well able to bear the fatigues of war, &s;et out with them, and was accom|panied by his pri&s;oner. They marched above 200 leagues acro&s;s the fore&s;t, and came at length to a plain where the Briti&s;h forces were encamped. The old man &s;hew|ed his pri&s;oner the tents at a di&s;tance; at the &s;ame time remarked his countenance with the mo&s;t diligent atten|tion. "There," &s;ays he, "are your countrymen; there is the enemy who wait to give us battle.

his hands, &s;tood &s;ome time &s;ilent; then looking ear|ne&s;tly at his pri&s;oner, he &s;aid, in a voice that was at once &s;oftened by tenderne&s;s and grief, "Ha&s;t thou a father?" "My father," &s;aid the young man, "was alive when I left my country." "Alas," &s;aid the In|dian, "how wretched mu&s;t he be!" He pau&s;ed a mo|ment, and then added, "Do&s;t thou know that I have been a father?&mdash;I am a father no more&mdash;I &s;aw my &s;on fall in battle&mdash;he fought at my &s;ide&mdash;I &s;aw him expire; but he died like a man.&mdash;He was covered with wounds when he fell dead at my feet&mdash;but I have revenged him!" He pronounced the&s;e words with the utmo&s;t vehemence; his body &s;hook with an univer&s;al tremor; and he was almo&s;t &s;tifled with &s;ighs that he would not &s;uffer to e&s;cape him. There was a keen re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s in his eye; but no tear would flow to his relief. At length he became calm by degrees; and turning towards the ea&s;t, where the &s;un was then ri&s;ing, "Do&s;t thou &s;ee," &s;aid he to the young officer, "the beauty of that &s;ky, which &s;parkles with prevailing day? and ha&s;t thou plea&s;ure in the &s;ight?" "Yes," replied the young of|ficer, "I have plea&s;ure in the beauty of &s;o fine a &s;ky." "I have none," &s;aid the Indian; and his tears then found their way. A few minutes after he &s;howed the young man a magnolia in full bloom. "Do&s;t thou &s;ee that beautiful tree?" &s;ays he: "and do&s;t thou look up|on it with plea&s;ure?" "Yes replied the officer, "I do look with plea&s;ure upon that beautiful tree."&mdash;"I have plea&s;ure in looking upon it no more," &s;aid the In|dian ha&s;til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and immediately added, "Go, return to thy countrymen, that thy father may &s;till have plea|&s;ure when he &s;ees the &s;un ri&s;e in the morning, and the trees blo&s;&s;om in the &s;pring."</P>

<P>AMONG other excellent arguments for the immortali|ty of the &s;oul, there is one drawn from the perpetual progre&s;s of the &s;oul to its perfection, without a po&s;&s;ibility of ever arriving at it; which is a hint that I do not remember to have &s;een opened and improved by others who have written on this &s;ubject, though it &s;eem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to me to carry a great weight with it.

it enter into the thoughts of man, that the &s;oul, which is capable of &s;uch immen&s;e perfections, and of receiving new improvements to all eternity, &s;hall fall away into nothing almo&s;t as &s;oon as it is created! Are &s;uch abi|lities made for no purpo&s;e? A brute arrives at a point of perfection that he can never pa&s;s: in a few years he has all the endowments he is capable of; and were he to live ten thou&s;and more, would be the &s;ame thing he is at pre&s;ent. Were a human &s;oul thus at a &s;tand in her accompli&s;hments; were her faculties to be full blown, and incapable of farther enlargements; I could imagine it might fall away in&s;en&s;ibly, and drop at once into a &s;tate of annihilation. But can we believe a thinking being, that is in a perpetual progre&s;s of improvements, and travelling on from perfection to perfection, after having ju&s;t looked abroad into the works of its Creator, and made a few di&s;coveries of His infinite goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom, and power, mu&s;t peri&s;h at her fir&s;t &s;etting out, and in the very beginning of her inquiries?</P>
<P>Man, con&s;idered in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, does not &s;eem born to enjoy life, but to deliver it down to others. This is not &s;urpri&s;ing to con&s;ider in animals, which are formed for our u&s;e, and can fini&s;h their bu&s;ine&s;s in a &s;hort life. The &s;ilk-worm, after having &s;pun her ta&s;k, lays her eggs and dies. But in this life man can never take in his full mea&s;ure of knowledge; nor has he time to &s;ubdue his pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;tabli&s;h his &s;oul in virtue, and come up to the perfection of his nature, before he is hurried off the &s;tage. Would an infinitely wi&s;e Being make &s;uch glorious creatures for &s;o mean a purpo&s;e? Can he delight in the production of &s;uch abortive intel|ligences, &s;uch &s;hort-lived rea&s;onable beings? Would he give us talents that are not to be exerted? capacities that are never to be gratified? How can we find that wi&s;dom which &s;hines through all his works, in the for|mation of man, without looking on this world as only a nur&s;ery for the next; and believing that the &s;everal generations of rational creatures, which ri&s;e up and di&s;|appear in &s;uch quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, are only to receive their fir&s;t rudiments of exi&s;tence here, and afterwards to be tran&s;planted into a more friendly climate, where they may &s;pread and flouri&s;h to all eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="021451_0093_0FB3F68D9E56A5B8">There is not, in my opinion, a more plea&s;ing and triumphant con&s;ideration in religion than this, of the per|petual progre&s;s which the &s;oul makes towards the per|fection of its nature without ever arriving at a period in it. To look upon the &s;oul as going on from &s;trength to &s;trength; to con&s;ider that &s;he is to &s;hine, with new acce&s;&s;ions of glory, to all eternity; that &s;he will be &s;till adding virtue to virtue, and knowledge to know|ledge; carries in it &s;omething wonderfully agreeable to that ambition which is natural to the mind of man. Nay, it mu&s;t be a pro&s;pect plea&s;ing to God him&s;elf, to &s;ee his creation for ever beautifying in his eyes, and drawing nearer to him, by greater degrees of re&s;em|blance.</P>
<P>Methinks this &s;ingle con&s;ideration, of the progre&s;s of a finite &s;pirit to perfection, will be &s;ufficient to extin|gui&s;h all envy in inferior natures, and all contempt in &s;uperior. That cherubim, which now appears as a God to a human &s;oul, knows very well that the period will come about in eternity, when the human &s;oul &s;hall be as perfect as he him&s;elf now is; nay, when &s;he &s;hall look down upon that degree of perfection as much as &s;he now falls &s;hort of it. It is true, the higher nature &s;till advances, and by that means pre&s;erves his di&s;tance and &s;uperiority in the &s;cale of being; but he knows, that, how high &s;oever the &s;tation is of which he &s;tands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at pre&s;ent, the inferior nature will at length mount up to it, and &s;hine forth in the &s;ame degree of glory.</P>
<P>With what a&s;toni&s;hment and veneration may we look into our &s;ouls, where there are &s;uch hidden &s;tores of virtue and knowledge, &s;uch inexhau&s;ted &s;ources of per|fection! We know not yet what we &s;hall be, nor will it ever enter into the heart of man to conceive the glo|ry that will be always in re&s;erve for him. The &s;oul, con&s;idered in relation to its Creator, is like one of tho&s;e mathematical lines that may draw nearer to another for all eternity, without a po&s;&s;ibility of touching it: and can there be a thought &s;o tran&s;porting, as to con&s;ider our&s;elves in the&s;e perpetual approaches to Him who is not only the &s;tandard of perfection but of happine&s;s?</P>

<P>Admiral An&s;on's expedition proves, how much a man of &s;en&s;e and re&s;olution may perform, though his prepa|rations may be very inadequate to the danger of his undertaking.</P>
<P>Before &s;o many nations had engaged in a war in or|der to decide whether the daughter of the Emperor Charles VI. &s;hould &s;ucceed her father, there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a war between Spain and England about a &s;hip: That war co&s;t both parties ten thou&s;and times more than the worth of what had given ri&s;e to it.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try of London, in the year 1739, &s;ent Ad|miral Vernon to Mexico. He there de&s;troyed Porto-Bello; but he failed in his attempt upon Carthagena. It was intended, at the &s;ame time, that George An&s;on &s;hould fall upon Peru by the South Sea, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to ruin, or at lea&s;t to weaken, the va&s;t empire which Spain had acquired in that part of the world, by

both ends. An&s;on was created commodore, that is, commander of a &s;quadron; there were given to him five ve&s;&s;els, a &s;ort of a &s;mall frigate of eight guns with about one hundred men on board, and two &s;hips loaded with provi&s;ions and merchandi&s;e: the&s;e two &s;hips were in|tended to carry on commerce, under the protection of the convoy; for it is peculiar to the Engli&s;h nation to mix traffic with warlike operations. Aboard the &s;qua|dron were fifteen hundred &s;eamen, with two hundred and &s;ixty &s;uperannuated invalids, and two hundred new-rai&s;ed recruits. He &s;teers his cour&s;e to the i&s;land of Madeira, which belongs to Portugal; he advances to the i&s;les of Cape Verde, and &s;ails by the coa&s;t of Brazil. His crew refre&s;hed them&s;elves in a little i&s;land named St. Catharine, which is covered with never fading verdure, and abounds with fruit through every &s;ea&s;on of the year. This i&s;land is twenty-&s;even de|grees beyond the tropic of Cancer. The commodore, after having coa&s;ted along the cold and uncultivated country of Patagonia, entered the Straits Le Maire about the end of February 1741; thus did he pa&s;s above a hundred degrees of latitude in le&s;s than five months. The little &s;loop or frigate of eight guns, named the Trial, was the fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el of the kind that ventured to double Cape Horn: She afterwards &s;eized, in the South Sea, a Spani&s;h &s;hip of &s;ix hundred tons, the crew of which little expected to have been taken in the Pacific Ocean by a &s;hip from England.</P>
<P>However, upon doubling Cape Horn, after having pa&s;&s;ed the Straits Le Maire, An&s;on's &s;quadron was &s;hat|tered and di&s;per&s;ed by violent tempe&s;ts. One half of the men aboard peri&s;hed by an inveterate &s;curvy. The ve&s;&s;el of the commodore, being &s;eparated from the re&s;t, put in at the de&s;ert i&s;land of Fernandes, which lies high|er up the South Sea towards the tropic of Capricorn. A rational reader, who beholds with horror the prodi|gious efforts which mortals make in order to render them&s;elves and their fellow-creatures unhappy, will per|haps receive &s;ome &s;atisfaction upon being informed that George An&s;on, finding the climate of this i&s;land ex|ceeding mild, and the &s;oil equally fertile, &s;owed in it pul&s;e and fruits, the &s;eed of which he brought with him
<PB N="97" REF="021451_0096_0FB3F6921DB77F88">
from England; by which means it, in a &s;hort time, be|came a plentiful country. Certain Spaniards, who touched there &s;ome time after, being, in the cour&s;e of the war carried pri&s;oners into England, formed an opi|nion, that An&s;on alone was capable of repairing the ra|vages of war by &s;uch an attention to the general good of mankind, and returned him thanks as their benefac|tor. Let me be allowed to &s;often, by &s;uch circum|&s;tances as the&s;e, the melancholy tenor of hi&s;tory, which is almo&s;t one continued narrative of murders and cala|mities.</P>
<P>An&s;on, who&s;e ve&s;&s;el carried &s;ixty guns, being joined by another of his &s;hips of war, and by the little frigate called the Trial, took &s;everal con&s;iderable prizes in crui|&s;ing near the i&s;land of Fernandes; but, having &s;oon af|ter advanced towards the Equator, he ventured to at|tack the town of Paita, upon the coa&s;t of America. He neither made u&s;e of his &s;hips of war, nor of his men, in executing this bold and hazardous attempt: The expe|dition was performed by fifty &s;oldiers in a boat with oars. They landed during the night. The &s;udden &s;ur|pri&s;e, the confu&s;ion, and the darkne&s;s, redoubled, mul|tiplied, and increa&s;ed the danger. The governor, the garri&s;on, and the inhabitants, fled on every &s;ide. In the mean time, the fifty Engli&s;h, without mole&s;tation, carried off the trea&s;ures which they found in the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and in private hou&s;es, during the &s;pace of three days. Some black &s;laves, a &s;pecies of animals who al|ways become the property of the fir&s;t that &s;eize them, not having fled, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Engli&s;h in carrying off the wealth of their former ma&s;ters. An&s;on cau&s;ed Paita to be burnt to a&s;hes, and then &s;et &s;ail; having plundered the Spnaiards with as much ea&s;e as they, in pa&s;t ages, plundered the Americans. Spain loft fifteen hundred thou&s;and pia&s;ters by the fire; the Engli&s;h gained about one hundred and eighty thou&s;and; which, added to the former captures, greatly enriched the &s;quadron. The great number of men carried off by the &s;curvy, left the bulk of the trea&s;ures to the &s;urvivers. This little &s;qua|dron came afterwards oppo&s;ite to Panama, upon the coa&s;t where pearls are dived for, and advanced to Aca|pulco, at the back of Mexico. The government of Ma|drid
<PB N="98" REF="021451_0097_0FB3F6939BDF77B0">
was then not aware of the ri&s;k it ran of lo&s;ing that va&s;t region of the world. If Admiral Vernon, who be|&s;ieged Carthagena upon the oppo&s;ite &s;ea, had &s;ucceeded, he might have a&s;&s;i&s;ted Commodore An&s;on. Thus, the i&s;thmus of Panama would have been taken by the Eng|li&s;h, both upon the right and left, and the Spaniards deprived of the very center of their American domini|ons.</P>
<P>An&s;on, who had but two &s;hips remaining, the re&s;t having been de&s;troyed by tempe&s;ts, confined all his en|terpri&s;es, and his &s;anguine hopes, to the taking of a large galleon which Mexico &s;ends every year to the i&s;land of Manilla in the Chine&s;e &s;eas. Manilla is one of the Philippine i&s;lands, &s;o called becau&s;e they were di&s;|covered during the reign of Philip II.</P>
<P>This galleon, laden with &s;ilver, would not have &s;et &s;ail if the Engli&s;h had been &s;een upon the coa&s;ts; and it did not leave the port till a con&s;iderable time after their departure. The commodore, therefore, cro&s;&s;ed the Pacific ocean, and all the climates between the Tropic and the Equator. Avarice, rendered honora|ble by fatigue and danger, made him traver&s;e the globe with his two remaining men of war. The &s;curvy con|tinued to afflict the &s;ailors upon the&s;e &s;eas; and, as one of the two ve&s;&s;els leaked on every &s;ide, they were ob|liged to abandon and &s;et fire to it, le&s;t the wreck &s;hould be thrown upon &s;ome of the Spani&s;h i&s;lands, and become of u&s;e to the inhabitants: The &s;oldiers and &s;ailors be|longing to this ve&s;&s;el were taken on board An&s;on's. At that time the only ve&s;&s;el that was left of his whole &s;qua|dron was his own &s;hip, called the Centurion, which carried &s;ixty guns, and was accompanied by two ten|ders. The Centurion e&s;caped alone from &s;o many dan|gers, but in a very &s;hattered condition; and, having none but &s;ick men on board, very fortunately touched at one of the Marianne i&s;lands called Tinian, which was at that time quite uninhabited. Not long before, it contained no le&s;s than thirty thou&s;and &s;ouls; but the greate&s;t part of the inhabitants had been &s;wept away by an epidemic di&s;ea&s;e, and the &s;urvivers had been removed to another i&s;land by the Spaniards.</P>
<P>The crew owed its pre&s;ervation to the i&s;land of Ti|nian.
<PB N="99" REF="021451_0098_0FB3F6951E8A38D8">
That i&s;land, which &s;urpa&s;&s;ed Fernandes in ferti|lity, abounded on all &s;ides with wood, &s;prings, and ri|vulets, tame animals, fruits, pul&s;e, and every thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary for food, the conveniencies of life, and for refit|ting the ve&s;&s;el. But the mo&s;t extraordinary thing found there, was a &s;ort of a tree, the ta&s;te of who&s;e fruit re&s;em|bled that of the be&s;t bread, a real trea&s;ure, which, if it could be tran&s;planted to our climate, would be greatly preferable to tho&s;e riches, which owe all their worth to opinion, and which men go in que&s;t of to the end of the earth, through &s;o many dangers and difficulties.</P>
<P>From this i&s;land he went to that of Formo&s;a; he then bent his cour&s;e towards China, to Macao, at the entrance of the river Canton, in order to repair his on|ly remaining ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The commodore, having completely refitted his &s;hip at Macao by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Chine&s;e, and having taken on board &s;ome Indian &s;ailors, and &s;ome Hollan|ders, whom he thought to be u&s;eful men, put to &s;ea again.</P>
<P>At length, upon the ninth of June, 1743, the &s;o much wi&s;hed-for Spani&s;h &s;hip was de&s;cried. It advanced to|wards Manilla, having but &s;ixty-four guns; the crew con&s;i&s;ted of five hundred and fifty men fit for action: the trea&s;ure which it carried amounted only to about fifteen hundred thou&s;and pia&s;ters in &s;ilver, with cochi|neal and other merchandi&s;e; becau&s;e the whole trea|&s;ure, which is generally double that &s;um, had been di|vided into two equal parts, and one half was carried by another galleon.</P>
<P>The commodore had but two hundred and forty men on board the Centurion. The captain of the galleon, perceiving the enemy, cho&s;e rather to venture the trea|&s;ure, than forfeit his reputation by flying before an En|gli&s;hman; for which rea&s;on, he hoi&s;ted as much &s;ail as po&s;&s;ible, in order to come up with and engage him.</P>
<P>The eager de&s;ire of &s;eizing riches, a pa&s;&s;ion much &s;tronger than the principle of duty, which directs to pre&s;erve them for the &s;overeign, the experience of the Engli&s;h, and the &s;kilful operations of the commodore, procured him the victory. Only two of his men were killed in the fight; the galleon lo&s;t &s;ixty-&s;even, who
<PB N="100" REF="021451_0099_0FB3F696A64D3CA0">
were &s;lain upon deck, and eighty-four were wounded. The number of his crew &s;till &s;urpa&s;&s;ed that of the com|modore's: however, he thought proper to &s;trike. The conqueror returned to Canton with this rich prize. He there maintained the honor of his country, by refu&s;ing to pay the impo&s;ts exacted by the Emperor of China from all foreign &s;hips: he in&s;i&s;ted that a man of war was not &s;ubject to them. His conduct overawed the Chine&s;e. The governor of Canton gave him audience, to which he was conducted through two ranks of &s;ol|diers, who&s;e number amounted to ten thou&s;and; after which he returned to his own country, by the Sunda i&s;lands and the Cape of Good Hope. Having thus &s;ailed round the world victorious, he landed in England the 4th of June 1744, after a voyage of three years and a half.</P>

<HEAD>XIV. ON PEDANTRY.</HEAD>
<P>PEDANTRY, in the common &s;en&s;e of the word, means an ab&s;urd o&s;tentation of learning, and &s;tiffne&s;s of phra|&s;eology, proceeding from a mi&s;guided knowledge of books, and a total ignorance of men.</P>
<P>But I have often thought, that we might extend its &s;ignification a good deal farther; and, in general, ap|ply it to that failing, which di&s;po&s;es a per&s;on to obtrude upon others &s;ubjects of conver&s;ation relating to his own bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;tudies, or amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>In this &s;en&s;e of the phra&s;e, we &s;hould find pedants in every character and condition of life. In&s;tead of a black coat and a plain &s;hirt, we &s;hould often &s;ee pedantry ap|pear in an embroidered &s;uit and Bru&s;&s;els lace; in&s;tead of being bedaubed with &s;nuff, we &s;hould find it breath|ing perfumes; and, in place of a book-worm, crawling through the gloomy cloi&s;ters of an univer&s;ity, we &s;hould mark it in the &s;tate of a gilded butterfly, buzzing through the gay region of the drawing-room.</P>
<P>Robert Dai&s;y, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> is a pedant of this la&s;t kind. When he tells you that his ruffles co&s;t twenty guineas a pair; that his buttons were the fir&s;t of the kind, made by one of the mo&s;t eminent arti&s;ts in Birmingham; that his buckles were procured by means of a friend at Pa|ris, and are the exact pattern of tho&s;e worn by the
<PB N="101" REF="021451_0100_0FB3F6981EAB3240">
Comte d' Artois; that the loop of his hat was of his own contrivance, and has &s;et the fa&s;hion to half a dozen of the fine&s;t fellows in town: when he de&s;cants on all the&s;e particulars, with that &s;mile of &s;elf-complacency which &s;its for ever on his cheek, he is as much a pedant as his quondam tutor, who recites ver&s;es from Pindar, tells &s;tories from Herodotus, and talks for an hour on the energy of the Greek particles.</P>
<P>But Mr. Dai&s;y is &s;truck dumb by the approach of his brother Sir Thomas, who&s;e pedantry goes a pitch higher, and pours out all the intelligence of France and Italy, whence the young Baronet is ju&s;t returned, after a tour of fifteen months over all the kingdoms of the continent. Talk of mu&s;ic, he cuts you &s;hort with the hi&s;tory of the fir&s;t &s;inger at Naples; of painting, he runs you down with a de&s;cription of the gallery at Florence; of architecture, he overwhelms you with the dimen&s;ions of St Peter's, or the grand church at Antwerp; or, if you leave the province of art altogether, and introduce the name of a river or hill, he in&s;tantly deluges you with the Rhine, or makes you dizzy with the height of Aet|na, or Mount Blanc.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s will have no difficulty of owning her great aunt to be a pedant, when &s;he talks all the time of dinner on the compo&s;ition of the pudding, or the &s;ea&s;oning of the mince-pies; or enters into a di&s;qui&s;ition on the figure of the dama&s;k table-cloth, with a word or two on the thrift of making one's own linen: but the young lady will be &s;urpri&s;ed when I inform her, that her own hi&s;tory of la&s;t Thur&s;day's a&s;&s;embly, with the epi&s;ode of Lady Di's feather, and the digre&s;&s;ion to the qualities of Mr Frizzle the hair-dre&s;&s;er, was al&s;o a piece of downright pe|dantry.</P>
<P>Mrs Caudle is guilty of the &s;ame weakne&s;s, when &s;he recounts the numberle&s;s wittici&s;ms of her daughter Em|my, de&s;cribes the droll figure her little Bill made ye&s;ter|day at trying on his fir&s;t pair of breeches, and informs us, that Bobby has got &s;even teeth, and is ju&s;t cutting an eighth, though he will be but nine months old next Wedne&s;day at &s;ix o'clock in the evening. Nor is her pedantry le&s;s di&s;gu&s;ting, when &s;he proceeds to enume|rate the virtues and good qualities of her hu&s;band;
<PB N="102" REF="021451_0101_0FB3F6999D80DB40">
though the&s;e la&s;t &s;pecies is &s;o uncommon, that it may, perhaps, be admitted into conver&s;ation for the &s;ake of novelty.</P>
<P>There is pedantry in every di&s;qui&s;ition, however ma|&s;terly it may be, that &s;tops the general conver&s;ation of the company. When Silius delivers that &s;ort of lec|ture he is apt to get into, though it is &s;upported by the mo&s;t exten&s;ive information and the cleare&s;t di&s;cernment, it is &s;till pedantry; and, while I admire the talents of Silius, I cannot help being unea&s;y at his exhibition of them. In the cour&s;e of this di&s;&s;ertation, the farther a man proceeds, the more he &s;eems to acquire &s;trength and inclination for the progre&s;s. La&s;t night, after &s;upper, Silius began upon Prote&s;tanti&s;m, proceeded to the Iri&s;h ma&s;&s;acre, went through the Revolution, drew the cha|racter of King William, repeated anecdotes of Schom|berg, and ended at a quarter pa&s;t twelve, by delineating the cour&s;e of the Boyne, in half a bumper of port, upon my be&s;t table; which river, happening to overflow its banks, did infinite damage to my cou&s;in Sophy's white &s;attin petticoat.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, every thing, in this &s;en&s;e of the word, is pedantry, which tends to de&s;troy that equality of con|ver&s;ation which is nece&s;&s;ary to the perfect ea&s;e and good-humor of the company. Every one would be &s;truck with the unpolitene&s;s of that per&s;on's behavior, who &s;hould help him&s;elf to a whole plate of pea&s;e or &s;traw|berries which &s;ome friend had &s;ent him for a rarity in the beginning of the &s;ea&s;on. Now, conver&s;ation is one of tho&s;e good things of which our gue&s;ts or companions are equally intitled to a &s;hare, as of any other con&s;ti|tuent part of the entertainment; and it is as e&s;&s;ential a want of politene&s;s to engro&s;s the one as to monopolize the other.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it unfortunately happens, that we are very inadequate judges of the value of our own di&s;cour&s;e, or the rate at which the di&s;po&s;itions of our company will incline them to hold it. The reflections we make, and the &s;tories we tell, are to be judged of by others, who may hold a very different opinion of their acutene&s;s or their humor. It will be prudent, therefore, to con&s;i|der, that the di&s;h we bring to this entertainment, how|ever
<PB N="103" REF="021451_0102_0FB3F69B1D246748">
plea&s;ing to our own ta&s;te, may prove but mode|rately palatable to tho&s;e we mean to treat with it; and that, to every man, as well as our&s;elves (except a few very humble ones,) his own conver&s;ation is the PLATE OF PEASE OR STRAWBERRIES.</P>

<HEAD>XV. ON THE DEATH OF A YOUNG LADY.</HEAD>
<P>THE con&s;ideration of death has always been made u&s;e of, by the morali&s;t and the divine, as a powerful incentive to virtue and piety. From the uncertainty of life, they have endeavored to &s;ink the e&s;timation of its plea&s;ures; and if they could not &s;trip the &s;eductions of vice of their pre&s;ent enjoyment, at lea&s;t to load them with the fear of their end.</P>
<P>Voluptuaries, on the other hand, have, from a &s;imilar reflection, endeavored to enhance the value, and per|&s;uade to the enjoyment, of temporal delights. They have advi&s;ed us to pluck the ro&s;es which would other|wi&s;e &s;oon wither of them&s;elves; to &s;eize the moments which we could not long command; and, &s;ince time was unavoidably fleeting, to crown its flight with joy.</P>
<P>Of neither of the&s;e per&s;ua&s;ives, whether of the moral or the licentious, the &s;evere or the gay, have the effects been great. Life mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily con&s;i&s;t of active &s;cenes, which exclude from its general tenor, the lei&s;ure of me|ditation and the influence of thought. The &s;chemes of the bu&s;y will not be checked by the uncertainty of their event, nor the amu&s;ements of the di&s;&s;ipated, be either controlled or endeared by the &s;hortne&s;s of their dura|tion. Even the cell of the anchorite, and the cloi&s;ter of the monk, have their bu&s;ine&s;s and their plea&s;ures; for &s;tudy may become bu&s;ine&s;s, and ab&s;traction plea&s;ure, when they engage the mind and occupy the time. A man may even enjoy the pre&s;ent and forget the future, at the very moment in which he is writing of the in|&s;ignificancy of the former and the importance of the latter.</P>
<P>It were ea&s;y to &s;how the wi&s;dom and benignity of Providence&mdash;Providence ever wi&s;e and benign&mdash;in this particular of our con&s;titution; but it would be trite to repeat arguments too obvious not to have been often ob&s;erved, and too ju&s;t not to have been always allowed.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="021451_0103_0FB3F69C9E8AA250">But though neither the &s;ituation of the world, nor the formation of our minds, allow the thoughts of fu|turity or death a con&s;tant or prevailing effect upon our lives, they may &s;urely &s;ometimes, not un&s;ea&s;onably, pre&s;s upon our imagination; even exclu&s;ive of their moral or religious u&s;e, there is a &s;ympathetic enjoyment which often makes it not only 'better,' but more delightful, 'to go the hou&s;e of mourning, than to the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting.'</P>
<P>Perhaps I felt it &s;o, when, but a few days &s;ince, I at|tended the funeral of a young lady, who was torn, in the bloom of youth and beauty, from the arms of a fa|ther who doted on her, of a family by whom &s;he was adored: I think I would not have exchanged my feel|ings at the time for all the mirth which gaiety could in|&s;pire, or all the plea&s;ure which luxury could be&s;tow.</P>
<P>Maria was in her twentieth year. To the beauty of her form, and excellence of her natural di&s;po&s;ition, a parent equally indulgent and attentive had done the ful|le&s;t ju&s;tice. To accompli&s;h her per&s;on, and to cultivate her mind, every endeavor had been u&s;ed; and they had been attended with that &s;ucce&s;s which they commonly meet with when not prevented by mi&s;taken fondne&s;s or untimely vanity. Few young ladies have attracted more admiration; none ever felt it le&s;s: with all the charms of beauty, and the poli&s;h of education, the plaine&s;t were not le&s;s affected, nor the mo&s;t ignorant le&s;s a&s;&s;uming. She died when every tongue was eloquent of her virtues, when every hope was ripening to reward them.</P>
<P>It is by &s;uch private and dome&s;tic di&s;tre&s;&s;es, that the &s;ofter emotions of the heart are mo&s;t &s;trongly excited. The fall of more important per&s;onages is commonly di|&s;tant from our ob&s;ervation; but even where it happens under our immediate notice, there is a mixture of other feelings by which our compa&s;&s;ion is weakened. The eminently great, or exten&s;ively u&s;eful, leave behind them a train of interrupted views and di&s;appointed expecta|tions, by which the di&s;tre&s;s is complicated beyond the &s;implicity of pity. But the death of one who, like Maria, was to &s;hed the influence of her virtues over the age of a father, and the childhood of her &s;i&s;ters, pre|&s;ents to us a little view of family affliction, which every eye can perceive and every heart can feel. On &s;cenes
<PB N="105" REF="021451_0104_0FB3F69E1E6AAAB8">
of public &s;orrow and national regret, we gaze as upon tho&s;e gallery-pictures which &s;trike us with wonder and admiration: dome&s;tic calamity is like the miniature of a friend, which we wear in our bo&s;oms, and keep for &s;ecret looks and &s;olitary enjoyment.</P>
<P>The la&s;t time I &s;aw Maria was in the mid&s;t of a crowded a&s;&s;embly of the fa&s;hionable and the gay, where &s;he fixed all eyes by the gracefulne&s;s of her motion, and the native dignity of her mein; yet &s;o tempered was that &s;uperiority which they conferred with gentlene&s;s and mode&s;ty, that not a murmur was heard, either from the rival&s;hip of beauty or the envy of homeline&s;s. From that &s;cene, the tran&s;ition was &s;o violent to the hear&s;e and the pall, the grave and the &s;od, that once or twice my imagination turned rebel to my &s;en&s;es: I beheld the objects around me as the painting of a dream, and thought of Maria as &s;till living.</P>
<P>I was &s;oon, however, recalled to the &s;ad reality. The figure of her father bending over the grave of his dar|ling child; the &s;ilent &s;uffering compo&s;ure in which his countenance was fixed; the tears of his attendants, who&s;e grief was light, and capable of tears; the&s;e gave me back the truth, and reminded me that I &s;hould &s;ee her no more. There was a flow of &s;orrow with which I &s;uffered my&s;elf to be borne along, with a melancholy kind of indulgence; but when her father dropped the cord with which he had helped to lay his Maria in the earth, its &s;ound on the coffin chilled my heart, and hor|ror for a moment took place of pity!</P>
<P>It was but for a moment.&mdash;He looked eagerly into the grave; made one involuntary motion to &s;top the a&s;|&s;i&s;tants who were throwing the earth into it; then &s;ud|denly recollecting him&s;elf, cla&s;ped his hands together, threw up his eyes to heaven; and then fir&s;t I &s;aw a few tears drop from them. I gave language to all this. It &s;poke a le&s;&s;on of faith, and piety, and re&s;ignation. I went away &s;orrowful; but my &s;orrow was neither un|gentle nor unmanly: ca&s;t on this world a glance rather of pity than of enmity; on the next, a look of humble|ne&s;s and hope!</P>

<HEAD>I. DESCRIPTION of the AMPHITHEATRE of TITUS.</HEAD>
<P>POSTERITY admires, and will long admire, the awful remains of the amphitheatre of Titus, which &s;o well de&s;erved the epithet of Colo&s;&s;al. It was a building of an elliptic figure, five hundred and &s;ixty-four feet in length, and four hundred and &s;ixty-&s;even in breadth; founded on four&s;core arches; and ri&s;ing, with four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive or|ders of architecture, to the height of one hundred and forty feet. The out&s;ide of the edifice was encru&s;ted with marble, and decorated with &s;tatues. The &s;lopes of the va&s;t concave which formed the in&s;ide, were filled and &s;urrounded with &s;ixty or eighty rows of &s;eats of marble, co|vered with cu&s;hions, and capable of receiving with ea&s;e above four&s;core thou&s;and &s;pectators. Sixty-four vomito|ries (for by that name the doors were aptly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed) poured forth the immen&s;e multitude; and the entrances, pa&s;&s;ages, and &s;tair-ca&s;es, were contrived with &s;uch exqui&s;ite &s;kill, that each per&s;on, whether of the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|natorial, the eque&s;trian, or the plebeian order, arrived at his de&s;tined place, without trouble or confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Nothing was omitted which in any re&s;pect could be &s;ub&s;ervient to the convenience and plea&s;ure of the &s;pec|tators. They were protected from the &s;un and rain by an ample canopy, occa&s;ionally drawn over their heads. The air was continually refre&s;hed by the playing of fountains, and profu&s;ely impregnated by the grateful &s;cent of aromatics. In the centre of the edifice, the arena or &s;tage was &s;trewed with the fine&s;t &s;and, and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively a&s;&s;umed the mo&s;t different forms. At one mo|ment, it &s;eemed to ri&s;e out of the earth like the garden of the He&s;perides; at another, it exhibited the rugged rocks and caverns of Thrace. The &s;ubterraneous pipes conveyed an inexhau&s;tible &s;upply of water; and what had ju&s;t before appeared a level plain, might be &s;uddenly converted into a wide lake, covered with armed ve&s;&s;els, and repleni&s;hed with the mon&s;ters of the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;</P>

The poet who de&s;cribes the games of Carinus, in the character of a &s;hepherd attracted to the capital by the fame of their magnificence, affirms, that the nets de&s;igned as a defence again&s;t the wild bea&s;ts, were of gold wire; that the porticoes were gilded; and that the belt or circle, which divided the &s;everal ranks of &s;pectators from each other, was &s;tudded with a precious mo&s;aic of beautiful &s;tones.</P>

<HEAD>II. REFLECTIONS IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I am in a &s;erious humor, I very often walk by my&s;elf in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey; where the gloomi|ne&s;s of the place, and the u&s;e to which it is applied, with the &s;ole<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nity of the building, and the condition of the people who lie in it, are apt to fill the mind with a kind of melancholy, or rather thoughtfulne&s;s, that is not di&s;agreeable. I ye&s;terday pa&s;&s;ed a whole afternoon in the church-yard, the cloi&s;ters, and the church, amu&s;ing my&s;elf with the tomb-&s;tones and in&s;criptions which I met with in tho&s;e &s;everal regions of the dead. Mo&s;t of them recorded nothing el&s;e of the buried per&s;on, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that he was born upon one day, and died upon another; the whole hi&s;tory of his life being comprehended in the&s;e two circum&s;tances, that are common to all mankind. I could not but look upon tho&s;e regi&s;ters of exi&s;tence, whether of bra&s;s or marble, as a kind of &s;atire upon the departed per&s;ons, who had left no other memorial of them&s;elves, but that they were born, and that they died.</P>
<P>Upon my going into the church, I entertained my&s;elf with the digging of a grave; and &s;aw, in every &s;hovelful of it that was thrown up, the fragment of a bone or &s;kull intermixed with a kind of fre&s;h-mouldering earth, that, &s;ome time or other, had a place in the compo&s;ition of an human body. Upon this, I began to con&s;ider with my&s;elf, what innumerable multitudes of people lay con|fu&s;ed together, under the pavement of that ancient ca|thedral how men and women, friends and enemies,
<PB N="108" REF="021451_0107_0FB3F6A29E49B538">
prie&s;ts and &s;oldiers, monks and prebendaries, were crum|bled among&s;t one another, and blended together in the &s;ame common ma&s;s; how beauty, &s;trength, and youth, with old age, weakne&s;s, and deformity, lay undi&s;tin|gui&s;hed in the &s;ame promi&s;cuous heap of matter.</P>
<P>After having thus &s;urveyed this great magazine of mortality as it were in the lump, I examined it more par|ticularly by the accounts which I found on &s;everal of the monuments which are rai&s;ed in every quarter of that an|cient fabric. Some of them were covered wich &s;uch ex|travagant epitaphs, that, if it were po&s;&s;ible for the dead per&s;on to be acquainted with them, he would blu&s;h at the prai&s;es which his friends have be&s;towed upon him. There are others &s;o exce&s;&s;ively mode&s;t, that they deliver the character of the per&s;on departed in Greek or He|brew, and by that means are not under&s;tood once in a twelve month. In the poetical quarter, I found there were poets who had no monuments, and monuments which had no poets. I ob&s;erved, indeed, that the pre|&s;ent war had filled the church with many of tho&s;e unin|habited monuments, which had been erected to the me|mory of per&s;ons who&s;e bodies were perhaps buried in the pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s of Blenheim, or in the bo&s;om of the ocean.</P>
<P>I could not but be very much delighted with &s;everal modern epitaphs, which are written with great elegance of expre&s;&s;ion and ju&s;tne&s;s of thought, and which there|fore do honor to the living as well as to the dead. As a foreigner is very apt to conceive an idea of the igno|rance or politene&s;s of a nation from the turn of their public monuments and in&s;criptions, they &s;hould be &s;ub|mitted to the peru&s;al of men of learning and genius, be|fore they are put into execution. Sir Cloude&s;ly Shovel's monument has very often given me great offence. In|&s;tead of the brave rough Engli&s;h admiral, which was the di&s;tingui&s;hing character of that plain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lant man, he is repre&s;ented on his his tomb by the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ure of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, dre&s;&s;ed in a long periwig, and repo&s;ing him&s;elf upon velvet cu&s;hions under a canopy of &s;tate. The in&s;cription is an|&s;werable to the monument; for, in&s;tead of celebrating the many remarkable actions he had performed in the &s;ervice of his country; it acquaints us only with the man+ner of his death, in which it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to
<PB N="109" REF="021451_0108_0FB3F6A41F1AA198">
reap any honor. The Dutch, whom we are apt to de&s;pi&s;e for want of genius, &s;how an infinitely greater ta&s;te in their buildings and works of this nature, than we meet with in tho&s;e of our own country. The mo|numents of their admirals, which have been erected at the public expence, repre&s;ent them like them&s;elves, and are adorned with ro&s;tral crowns and naval ornaments, with beautiful fe&s;toons of &s;ea-weed, &s;hells, and coral.</P>
<P>I know that entertainments of this nature are apt to rai&s;e dark and di&s;mal thoughts&punc; in timorous minds and gloomy imaginations: but, for my own part, though I am always &s;erious, I do not know what it is to be me|lancholy; and can therefore take a view of nature in her deep and &s;olemn &s;cenes, with the &s;ame plea&s;ure as in her mo&s;t gay and delightful ones. By the&s;e means, I can improve my&s;elf with objects which others con&s;ider with terror.&mdash;When I look upon the tombs of the great, every emotion of envy dies in me; when I read the epi|taphs of the beautiful, every inordinate de&s;ire goes out; when I meet with the grief of parents upon a tomb-&s;tone, my heart melts with compa&s;&s;ion; when I &s;ee the tomb of the parents them&s;elves, I con&s;ider the vanity of grie|ving after tho&s;e whom we mu&s;t quickly follow. When I &s;ee kings lying by tho&s;e who depo&s;ed them; when I con&s;ider rival wits placed &s;ide by &s;ide, or the holy men that divided the world with their conte&s;ts and di&s;putes; I reflect with &s;orrow and a&s;toni&s;hment on the little com|petitions, factions, and debates of mankind. When I read the &s;everal dates of the tombs, of &s;ome that died ye&s;terday, and &s;ome &s;ix hundred years ago, I con&s;ider that gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at day when we &s;hall all of us be contemporaries, and make our appearance together.</P>

treated as a queen. No &s;tranger, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, to di&s;&s;imulation: which, in that perfidious court where &s;he received her education, was reckoned among the nece&s;|&s;ary arts of government. Not in&s;en&s;ible to flattery, or uncon&s;cious of that plea&s;ure with which almo&s;t every wo|man beholds the influence of her own beauty. Formed with the qualities that we love, not with the talents that we admire, &s;he was an agreeable woman rather than an illu&s;trious queen.</P>
<P>The vivacity of her &s;pirit, not &s;ufficiently tempered with &s;ound judgment, and the warmth of her heart, which was not at all times under the re&s;traint of di&s;cre|tion, betrayed her both into errors and into crimes. To &s;ay that &s;he was always unfortunate, will not account for that long and almo&s;t uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ca|lamities which befel her; we mu&s;t likewi&s;e add, that &s;he was often imprudent. Her pa&s;&s;ion for Darnly was ra&s;h, youthful, and exce&s;&s;ive. And, though the &s;udden tran&s;ition to the oppo&s;ite extreme was the natural effect of her ill-requited love, and of his ingratitude, in&s;o|lence, and brutality; yet neither the&s;e, nor Bothwell's artful addre&s;s and important &s;ervices, can ju&s;tify her at|tachment to that nobleman. Even the manners of the age, licentious as they were, are no apology for this un|happy pa&s;&s;ion; nor can they induce us to look on that tragical and infamous &s;cene which followed upon it, with le&s;s abhorrence. Humanity will draw a veil over this part of her character, which it cannot approve; and may perhaps prompt &s;ome to impute her actions to her &s;itua|tion, more than to her di&s;po&s;ition; and to lament the unhappine&s;s of the former, rather than accu&s;e the per|ver&s;ene&s;s of the latter. Mary's &s;ufferings exceed, both in degree and in duration, tho&s;e tragical di&s;tre&s;&s;es which fancy has feigned to excite &s;orrow and commi&s;eration; and while we &s;urvey them, we are apt altogether to for|get her frailties: we think of her faults with le&s;s indig|nation; and approve of our tears, as if they were &s;hed for a per&s;on who had attained much nearer to pure vir+tue.</P>
<P>With regard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the queen's per&s;on, a circum&s;tance not to be omitted in writing the hi&s;tory of a female reign, all contemporary authors agree in a&s;cribing to

Mary the utmo&s;t beauty of countenance, and elegance of &s;hape, of which the human form is capable. Her hair was black, though, according to the fa&s;hion of that age, &s;he frequently wore borrowed locks, and of differ|ent colors. Her eyes were a dark gray, her com|plexion was exqui&s;itely fine, and her hands and arms re|markably delicate both as to &s;hape and color. Her &s;ta|ture was of an height that ro&s;e to the maje&s;tic. She danced, &s;he walked, and rode, with equal grace. Her ta&s;te for mu&s;ic was ju&s;t; and &s;he both &s;ung and played upon the lute with uncommon &s;kill. Towards the end of her life &s;he began to grow fat; and her long con|finement, and the coldne&s;s of the hou&s;es in which &s;he was impri&s;oned, brought on a rheumati&s;m, which de|prived her of the u&s;e of her limbs.

<HEAD>IV. CHARACTER OF QUEEN ELIZABETH.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few per&s;onages in hi&s;tory who have been more expo&s;ed to the calumny of enemies and the adulation of friends, than Queen Elizabeth; and yet there &s;carce is any who&s;e reputation has been more cer|tainly determined, by the unanimous con&s;ent of po&s;te|rity. The unu&s;ual length of her admini&s;tration, and the &s;trong features of her character, were able to o|vercome all prejudices; and, obliging her detractors to abate much of their invectives, and her admirers &s;ome|what of their panegyrics, have at la&s;t, in &s;pite of politi|cal factions, and, what is more, of religious animo&s;ities, produced an uniform judgment with regard to her con|duct. Her vigor, her con&s;tancy, her magnanimity, her penetration, vigilance, and addre&s;s, are allowed to merit the highe&s;t prai&s;es, and appear not to have been &s;urpa&s;|&s;ed by any per&s;on who ever filled a throne: a conduct le&s;s rigorous, le&s;s imperious, more &s;incere, more indul|gent to her people, would have been requi&s;ite to form a perfect character. By the force of her mind, &s;he con|trolled all her more active and &s;tronger qualities, and prevented them from running into exce&s;s. Her heroi&s;m was exempted from all temerity, her frugality from ava|rice, her friend&s;hip from partiality, her enterpri&s;e from
<PB N="112" REF="021451_0111_0FB3F6A8A2DFFA80">
turbulency and a vain ambition: &s;he guarded not her&s;elf, with equal care or equal &s;ucce&s;s, from le&s;&s;er infirmities; the rival&s;hip of beauty, the de&s;ire of admiration, the jea|lou&s;y of love, and the &s;allies of anger.</P>
<P>Her &s;ingular talents for government were founded equally on her temper and on her capacity. Endowed with a great command over her&s;elf, &s;he &s;oon obtained an uncontrolled a&s;cendant over the people, and while &s;he merited all their e&s;teem by her real virtue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;he al&s;o en|gaged their affection by her pretended ones. Few &s;ove|reigns of England &s;ucceeded to the throne in more diffi|cult circum&s;tances, and none ever conducted the go|vernment with &s;uch uniform &s;ucce&s;s and felicity. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hough unacquainted with the practice of toleration, the true &s;ecret for managing religious factions, &s;he pre&s;erved her people, by her &s;uperior prudence, from tho&s;e confu&s;ions in which theological controver&s;y had involved all the neighboring nations: and though her enemies were the mo&s;t powerful princes of Europe, the mo&s;t active, the mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing, the lea&s;t &s;crupulous, &s;he was able, by her vigor, to make deep impre&s;&s;ions on their &s;tate; her own greatne&s;s, meanwhile, remaining untouched and un|impaired.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e mini&s;ters and brave warriors who flouri&s;hed during her reign &s;hare the prai&s;e of her &s;ucce&s;s; but, in|&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening the applau&s;e due to her, they make great addition to it. They owed, all of them, their ad|vancement to her choice; they were &s;upported by her con&s;tancy; and, with all their ability, they were never able to acquire an undue a&s;cendant over her. In her family, in her court, in her kingdom, &s;he remained equally mi&s;tre&s;s. The force of the tender pa&s;&s;ions was great over her, but the force of her mind was &s;till &s;upe|rior; and the combat which her victory vi&s;ibly co&s;t her, &s;erves only to di&s;play the firmne&s;s of her re&s;olution, and the loftine&s;s of her ambitious &s;entiments.</P>
<P>The fame of this prince&s;s, though it has &s;urmounted the prejudices both of faction and of bigotry, yet lies &s;till expo&s;ed to another predjudice, which is more durable, becau&s;e more natural; and which, according to the dif|ferent views in which we &s;urvey her, is capable either of exalting beyond mea&s;ure, or dimini&s;hing, the lu&s;tre of
<PB N="113" REF="021451_0112_0FB3F6AA1DC50860">
her character. This prejudice is founded on the con&s;i|deration of her &s;ex. When we contemplate her as a woman, we are apt to be &s;truck with the highe&s;t admi|ration of her qualities and exten&s;ive capacity; but we are al&s;o apt to require &s;ome more &s;oftne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, &s;ome greater lenity of temper, &s;ome of tho&s;e amiable weakne&s;&s;es by which her &s;ex is di&s;tingui&s;hed. But the true method of e&s;timating her merit, is to lay a&s;ide all the&s;e con&s;iderations, and to con&s;ider her merely as a ra|tional being, placed in authority, and intru&s;ted with the government of mankind. We may find it difficult to reconcile our fancy to her as a wife or a mi&s;tre&s;s; but her qualities as a &s;overeign, though with &s;ome con&s;ider|able exceptions, are the object of undi&s;puted applau&s;e and approbation.</P>

With this view, he called Philip out of Eng|land; where the peevi&s;h temper of his queen, which in|crea&s;ed with her de&s;pair of having i&s;&s;ue, rendered him extremely unhappy, and the jealou&s;y of the Engli&s;h left him no hopes of obtaining the direction of their affairs. Having a&s;&s;embled the &s;tates of the Low Countries at Bru&s;&s;els, on the twenty-fifth of October one thou&s;and five hundred and fifty-five, Charles &s;eated him&s;elf for the la&s;t time in the chair of &s;tate; on one &s;ide of which was placed his &s;on, and on the other his &s;i&s;ter the queen of Hungary, regent of the Netherlands; with a &s;plendid retinue of the grandees of Spain, and princes of the em|pire &s;tanding behind him. The pre&s;ident of the council of Flanders, by his command, explained, in a few words, his intention in calling this extraordinary meeting of the &s;tates. He then read the in&s;trument of re&s;ignation, by which Charles &s;urrendered to his &s;on Philip all his ter|ritories, juri&s;diction, and authority in the Low Coun|tries; ab&s;olving his &s;ubjects there from their oath of al|legiance to him, which he required them to transfer to

<P>Charles then ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and leaning on the &s;houlder of the prince of Orange, becau&s;e he was unable to &s;tand without &s;upport, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the au|dience; and, from a paper which he held in his hand in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t his memory, he recounted with dignity, but without o&s;tentation, all the great things which he had undertaken and performed &s;ince the commencement of his admini&s;tration. He ob&s;erved, that, from the &s;even|teenth year of his age he had dedicated all his thoughts and attention to public objects, re&s;erving no portion of his time for the indulgence of his ea&s;e, and very little for the enjoyment of private plea&s;ure: that, either in a pa|cific or ho&s;tile manner, he had vi&s;ited Germany nine times, Spain &s;ix times, France four times, Italy &s;even times, the Low Countries ten times, England twice, A|frica as often, and had made eleven voyages by &s;ea: that, while his health permitted him to di&s;charge his duty, and the vigor of his con&s;titution was equal in any de|gree to the arduous office of governing &s;uch exten|&s;ive dominions, he had never &s;hunned labor, nor re|pined under fatigue: that, now, when his health was broken, and his vigor exhau&s;ted by the rage of an in|curable di&s;temper, his growing infirmities admoni&s;hed him to retire; nor was he &s;o fond of reigning as to re|tain the &s;ceptre in an impotent hand, which was no long|er able to protect his &s;ubjects, or to render them happy: that, in&s;tead of a &s;overeign worn out with di&s;ea&s;es and &s;carcely half alive, he gave them one in the prime of life, accu&s;tomed already to govern, and who added to the vigor of youth all the attention and &s;agacity of maturer years: that if, during the cour&s;e of a long ad|mini&s;tration, he had committed any material error in government, or if, under the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;o many and great affairs, and amid&s;t the attention which he had been obliged to give them, he had either neglected or injured any of his &s;ubjects, he now implored their forgivene&s;s: that, for his part, he &s;hould ever retain a grateful &s;en&s;e of their fidelity and attachment, and would carry the re|membrance of it along with him to the place of his re|treat,

<P>Then, turning towards Philip, who fell on his knees and ki&s;&s;ed his father's hand, "If," &s;ays he, "I had left you, by my death, this rich inheritance, to which I have made &s;uch large additions, &s;ome regard would have been ju&s;tly due to my memory on that account; but now, when I voluntarily re&s;ign to you what I might have &s;till retained, I may well expect the warme&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ions of thanks on your part. With the&s;e, however, I di&s;pen&s;e; and &s;hall con&s;ider your concern for the wel|fare of your &s;ubjects, and your love of them, as the be&s;t and mo&s;t acceptable te&s;timony of your gratitude to me. It is in your power, by a wi&s;e and virtuous admini&s;tra|tion, to ju&s;tify the extraordinary proof which I this day give of my paternal affection, and to demon&s;trate that you are worthy of the confidence which I repo&s;e in you. Pre&s;erve an inviolable regard for religion; maintain the Catholic faith in its purity; let the laws of your country be &s;acred in your eyes; encroach not on the rights and privileges of your people; and, if the time &s;hall ever come when you &s;hall wi&s;h to enjoy the tranquillity of private life, may you have a &s;on, endowed with &s;uch qualities that you can re&s;ign your &s;ceptre to him, with as much &s;atisfaction as I give up mine to you."</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Charles had fini&s;hed this long addre&s;s to his &s;ubjects and to their new &s;overeign, he &s;unk into the chair, exhau&s;ted and ready to die with the fatigue of &s;uch an extraordinary effort. During his di&s;cour&s;e, the whole audience melted into tears; &s;ome, from admira|tion of his magnanimity; others, &s;oftened by the ex|pre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s towards his &s;on and of love to his people; and all were affected with the deepe&s;t &s;orrow at lo&s;ing a &s;overeign, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed the Nether|lands, his native country, with particular marks of his regard and attachment.</P>
<P>A few weeks thereafter, Charles, in an a&s;&s;embly no le&s;s &s;plendid, and with a ceremonial equally pompous, re&s;igned to his &s;on the crowns of Spain, with all the ter|ritories depending on them, both in the old and in the

new world. Of all the&s;e pa&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, he re&s;erved nothing for him&s;elf but an annual pen&s;ion of an hundred thou&s;and crowns, to defray the charges of his family, and to afford him a &s;mall &s;um for acts of beneficence and charity.</P>
<P>The place he had cho&s;en for his retreat was the mo|na&s;tery of St Ju&s;tus, in the province of E&s;tremadura. It was &s;eated in a vale of no great extent, watered by a &s;mall brook, and &s;urrounded by ri&s;ing grounds covered with lofty trees. From the nature of the &s;oil, as well as the temperature of the climate, it was e&s;teemed the mo&s;t healthful and delicious &s;ituation in Spain. Some months before his re&s;ignation, he had &s;ent an architect thither to add a new apartment to the mona&s;tery for his accom|modation; but he gave &s;trict orders that the &s;tile of the building &s;hould be &s;uch as &s;uited his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, rather than his former dignity. It con&s;i&s;ted only of &s;ix rooms; four of them in the form of friars cells, with na|ked walls; the other two, each twenty feet &s;quare, were hung with brown cloth, and furni&s;hed in the mo&s;t &s;imple manner. They were all on a level with the ground; with a door on one &s;ide into a garden, of which Charles him&s;elf had given the plan, and which he had filled with various plants, intending to cultivate them with his own hands. On the other &s;ide they communicated with the chapel of the mona&s;tery, in which he was to perform his devotions.&mdash;Into this humble retreat, hardly &s;ufficient for the comfortable accommodation of a private gentle|man, did Charles enter with twelve dome&s;tics only. He buried there, in &s;olitude and &s;ilence, his grandeur, his ambition, together with all tho&s;e va&s;t projects, which, during half a century, had alarmed and agitated Eu|rope, filling every kingdom in it by turns with the ter|ror of his arms, and the dread of being &s;ubjected to his power.</P>

<HEAD>VI. IMPORTANCE OF VIRTUE.</HEAD>
<P>VIRTUE is of intrin&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> value and good de&s;ert, and of indi&s;pen&s;able obligation; not the creature of will, but nece&s;&s;ary and immutable; not local or temporary, but of equal extent and antiquity with the Divine mind; not a mode of &s;en&s;ation, but everla&s;ting truth; not de|pendent

on power, but the guide of all power. Virtue is the foundation of honor and e&s;teem, and the fource of all beauty, order, and happine&s;s, in nature. It is what confers value on all the other endowments and qua|lities of a rea&s;onable being, to which they ought to be ab&s;olutely &s;ub&s;ervient; and without which, the more eminent they are, the more hideous deformities and the greater cur&s;es they become.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of it is not confined to any one &s;tage of our exi&s;tence, or to any particular &s;ituation we can be in, but reaches through all the periods and circum&s;tances of our being. Many of the endowments and talents we now po&s;&s;e&s;s, and of which we are too apt to be proud, will cea&s;e entire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y with the pre&s;ent &s;tate; but this will be our ornament and dignity, in every future &s;tate to which we may be removed. Beauty and wit will die, learning will vani&s;h away, and all the arts of life be &s;oon forgot; but virtue will remain for ever. This unites us to the whole rational creation; and fits us for conver|&s;ing with any order of &s;uperior natures, and for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> place in any part of God's works. It procures us the appro|bation and love of all wi&s;e and good beings, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enders them our allies and friends. But what is of un&s;peak|ably greater con&s;equence is, that it makes God our friend, a&s;&s;imilates and unites our minds to him, and en|gages his Almighty power in our defence. Superior beings of all ranks are bound by it no le&s;s than our&s;elves. It has the &s;ame authority in all worlds that it has in this. The further any being is advanced in excellence and perfection, the greater is his attachment to it, and the more he is under its influence.&mdash;To &s;ay no more, it is the law of the whole univer&s;e, it &s;tands fir&s;t in the e&s;timation of the Deity, its original is his nature, and it is the very object that makes him lovely.</P>
<P>Such is the importance of virtue.&mdash;Of what con&s;e|quence, therefore, is it that we practi&s;e it! There is no argument or motive in any re&s;pect fitted to influence a rea&s;onable mind, which does not call us to this. One virtuous di&s;po&s;ition of &s;oul is preferable to the greate&s;t natural accompli&s;hments and abilities, and of more va|lue than all the trea&s;ures of the world.&mdash;If you are wi&s;e, then, &s;tudy virtue, and contemn every thing that
<PB N="118" REF="021451_0117_0FB3F6B19DD58320">
can come in competition with it. Remember, that no|thing el&s;e de&s;erves one anxious thought or wi&s;h. Re|member, that this alone is honor, glory, wealth, and happine&s;s. Secure this, and you &s;ecure every thing. Lo&s;s this, and all is lo&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>VII. ADDRESS TO ART.</HEAD>
<P>O ART! thou di&s;tingui&s;hing attribute and honor of human kind! who art not only able to imitate nature in her graces, but even to adorn her with graces of thine own! Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of thee, the meane&s;t genius grows de&s;erving, and has a ju&s;t demand for a portion of our e&s;teem: devoid of thee, the brighte&s;t of our kind lie lo&s;t and u&s;ele&s;s, and are but poorly di&s;tingui&s;hed from the mo&s;t de&s;picable and ba&s;e. When we inhabited fore&s;ts in common with brutes, nor otherwi&s;e known from them than by the figure of our &s;pecies, thou taughte&s;t us to a&s;&s;ert the &s;overeignty of our nature, and to a&s;&s;ume that empire for which providence intended us. Thou&s;ands of utilities owe their birth to thee; thou&s;ands of elegancies, plea&s;ures, and joys, without which life it&s;elf would be but an in&s;ipid po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Wide and exten&s;ive is the reach of thy dominion. No element is there, either &s;o violent or &s;o &s;ubtle, &s;o yield|ing or &s;o &s;luggi&s;h, as, by the powers of its nature, to be &s;uperior to thy direction. Thou dreade&s;t not the fierce impetuo&s;ity of Fire, but compelle&s;t its violence to be both obedient and u&s;eful. By it thou &s;oftene&s;t the &s;tubborn tribe of minerals, &s;o as to be formed and moulded into &s;hapes innumerable. Hence weapons, armor, coin: and, previous to the&s;e and other thy works and ener|gies, hence all tho&s;e various tools and in&s;truments, which empower thee to proceed to farther ends more ex|cellent. Nor is the &s;ubtle Air le&s;s obedient to thy power, whether thou wille&s;t it to be a mini&s;ter to our plea&s;ure or utility. At they command, it giveth birth to &s;ounds, which charm the &s;oul with all the powers of harmony. Under thy in&s;truction, it moves the &s;hip over &s;eas; while that yielding element, where otherwi&s;e we &s;ink, even Water it&s;elf, is by thee taught to bear us; the va&s;t ocean, to promote that intercour&s;e of nations which ignorance would imagine it was de&s;tined to intercept.
<PB N="119" REF="021451_0118_0FB3F6B31E34F8A0">
To &s;ay how thy influence is &s;een on Earth, would be to teach the meane&s;t what he knows already. Suffice it but to mention, fields of arable and pa&s;ture; lawns, and groves, and gardens, and plantations; cottages, villages, ca&s;tles, towns; palaces, temples, and &s;pacious cities.</P>
<P>Nor does thy empire end in &s;ubjects thus inanimate. Its power al&s;o extends through the various race of Ani|mals, who either patiently &s;ubmit to become thy &s;laves, or are &s;ure to find thee an irre&s;i&s;tible foe. The faithful dog, the patient ox, the generous hor&s;e, and the mighty elephant, are content all to receive their in&s;tructions from thee, and readily to lend their natural in&s;tincts or &s;trength to perform tho&s;e offices which thy occa&s;ions call for. If there be found any &s;pecies which are &s;erviceable when dead, thou &s;ugge&s;te&s;t the means to inve&s;tigate and take them: if any be &s;o &s;avage as to refu&s;e being tamed, or of natures fierce enough to venture an attack, thou teache&s;t us to &s;corn their brutal rage, to meet, repel, pur&s;ue, and conquer.</P>
<P>Such, O Art! is thy amazing influence, when thou art employed only on the&s;e inferior &s;ubjects, on nature inanimate, or at be&s;t irrational. But, whenever thou choo&s;e&s;t a &s;ubject more noble, and &s;ette&s;t to the cultiva|ting of Mind it&s;elf, then 'tis thou become&s;t truly amiable and divine, the ever-flowing &s;ource of tho&s;e &s;ublimer beauties of which no &s;ubject but mind alone is capable. Then 'tis thou art enabled to exhibit to mankind the admired tribes of poets and orators, the &s;acred train of patriots and heroes, the god-like li&s;t of philo&s;ophers and legi&s;lators, the forms of virtuous and equal polities, where private welfare is made the &s;ame with public, where crowds them&s;elves prove di&s;intere&s;ted, and vir|tue is made a national and popular characteri&s;tic.</P>
<P>Hail! &s;acred &s;ource of all the&s;e wonders! Thy&s;elf in|&s;truct me to prai&s;e thee worthily; through whom, what|ever we do, is done with elegance and beauty; without whom, what we do is ever gracele&s;s and deformed.&mdash; Venerable power! by what name &s;hall I addre&s;s thee?

<HEAD>VIII. FLATTERY.</HEAD>
<P>FLATTERY is a manner of conver&s;ation very &s;hame|ful in it&s;elf, but beneficial to the flatterer.</P>
<P>If a flatterer is upon a public walk with you, "Do but mind," &s;ays he, "how every one's eye is upon you. Sure there is not a man in Athens that is taken &s;o much notice of. You had ju&s;tice done you ye&s;terday in the portico. There were above thirty of us together; and, the que&s;tion being &s;tarted who was the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble per&s;on in the commonwealth? the whole company was of the &s;ame &s;ide. In &s;hort, Sir, every one made familiar with your name" He follows this whi&s;per with a thou&s;and other flatteries of the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>Whenever the per&s;on to whom he would make his court begins to &s;peak, the &s;ycophant begs the company to be &s;ilent, mo&s;t impudently prai&s;es him to his face, in raptures all the while he talks, and, as &s;oon as he has done, cries out, That is perfectly right! When his pa|tron aims at being witty upon any man, he is ready to bur&s;t at the &s;martne&s;s of his raillery, and &s;tops his mouth with his handkerchief that he may not laugh out. If he calls his children about him, the flatterer has a poc|ket full of apples for them, which he di&s;tributes among them with a great deal of fondne&s;s, wonders to &s;ee &s;o many fine boys, and, turning about to the father, tells him they are all as like him as they can &s;tare.</P>
<P>When he is invited to a fea&s;t, he is the fir&s;t man that calls for a gla&s;s of wine, and is wonderfully plea&s;ed with the deliciou&s;ne&s;s of the flavor; gets as near as po&s;&s;ible to the man of the hou&s;e, and tells him with much con|cern that he eats nothing him&s;elf. He &s;ingles out &s;ome particular di&s;h, and recommends it to the re&s;t of the com|pany for a rarity. He de&s;ires the ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t to &s;it in a warmer part of the room, begs him to take more care of his health, and advi&s;es him to put on a &s;upernu|merary garment in this cold weather. He is in a clo&s;e whi&s;per with him during the whole entertainment, and
<PB N="121" REF="021451_0120_0FB3F6B61EDF61A0">
has neither eyes nor ears for any one el&s;e in the com|pany.</P>
<P>If a man &s;hows him his hou&s;e, he extols the architect, admires the gardens, and expatiates upon the furni|ture. If the owner is gro&s;sly flattered in a picture, he outflatters the painter; and, though he di&s;covers a great likene&s;s in it, can by no means allow that it does ju&s;tice to the original.&mdash;In &s;hort, his whole bu&s;ine&s;s is to in|gratiate him&s;elf with tho&s;e who hear him, and to wheedle them out of their &s;en&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>IX. THE ABSENT MAN.</HEAD>
<P>MENALCAS comes down in the morning: opens his door to go out&punc; but &s;huts it again, becau&s;e he perceives he has his night-cap on; and, examining him&s;elf further, finds that he is but half-&s;haved, that he has &s;tuck his &s;word on his right &s;ide, that his &s;tockings are about his heels, and that his &s;hirt is over his breeches.</P>
<P>When he is dre&s;&s;ed, goes to court; comes into the drawing-room; and, walking upright under a branch of candle&s;ticks, his wig is caught up by one of them, and hangs dangling in the air. All the courtiers fall a|laughing; but Menalcas laughs louder than any of them, and looks about for the per&s;on that is the je&s;t of the company. Coming down to the court-gate, he finds a coach; which, taking for his own, he whips into it; and the coachman drives off, not doubting but he car|ries his ma&s;ter. As &s;oon as he &s;tops, Menalcas throws him&s;elf out of the coach, cro&s;&s;es the court, a&s;cends the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and runs through all the chambers with the greate&s;t familarity, repo&s;es him&s;elf on a couch, and fan|cies him&s;elf at home. The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e at la&s;t comes in. Menalcas ri&s;es to receive him, and de&s;ires him to &s;it down. He talks, mu&s;es, and then talks again. The gentleman of the hou&s;e is tired and amazed. Me|nalcas is no le&s;s &s;o; but is every moment in hopes that his impertinent gue&s;t will at la&s;t end his tedious vi&s;it. Night comes on, when Menalcas is hardly convinced.</P>
<P>When he is playing at backgammon, he calls for a full gla&s;s of wine and water. It is his turn to throw. He has the box in one hand, and his gla&s;s in the other; and, being extremely dry and unwilling to lo&s;e time, he &s;wal|lows
<PB N="122" REF="021451_0121_0FB3F6B79D7C4378">
down both the dice, and at the &s;ame time throws his wine into the tables. He writes a letter, and flings the &s;and into the ink-bottle. He writes a &s;econd, and mi&s;takes the &s;uper&s;cription. A nobleman receives one of them, and, upon opening it, reads as follows: "I would have you, hone&s;t Jack, immediately upon the receipt of this, take in hay enough to &s;erve the winter." His farmer receives the other, and is amazed to &s;ee in it, "My Lord, I received your Grace's commands."</P>
<P>If he is at an entertainment, you may &s;ee the pieces of bread continually multiplying round his plate: it is true the company want it, as well as their knives and forks, which Menalcas does not let them keep long. Sometimes in a morning he puts his whole family in a hurry, and at la&s;t goes out without being able to &s;tay for his coach or breakfa&s;t; and, for that day, you may &s;ee him in every part of the town, except the very place where he had appointed to be upon bu&s;ine&s;s of im|portance.</P>
<P>You would often take him for every thing that he is not&mdash;For a fellow quite &s;tupid, for he hears nothing; for a fool, for he talks to him&s;elf, and has a hundred grimaces and motions with his head which are altoge|ther involuntary; for a proud man, for he looks full up|on you, and takes no notice of your &s;aluting him. The truth of it is, his eyes are open, but he makes no u&s;e of them, and neither &s;ees you, nor any man, nor any thing el&s;e. He came once from his country-hou&s;e, and his own footmen undertook to rob him, and &s;ucceeded. They held a flambeau to his throat, and bid him deliver his pur&s;e. He did &s;o: and coming home, told his friends he had been robbed. They de&s;ire to know the particulars&mdash;"A&s;k my &s;ervants," &s;aid Menalcas; "for they were with me."</P>

<HEAD>X. THE MONK.</HEAD>
<P>A POOR monk of the order of St Francis came into the room to beg &s;omething for his convent. The mo|ment I ca&s;t my eyes upon him, I was determined not to give him a &s;ingle &s;ous; and accordingly I put my pur&s;e into my pocket&mdash;buttoned it up&mdash;&s;et my&s;elf a little more upon my center, and advanced up gravely to
<PB N="123" REF="021451_0122_0FB3F6B91F99D418">
him: there was &s;omething, I fear forbidding in my look: I have his figure this moment before my eyes, and think there was that in it which de&s;erved better.</P>
<P>The monk, as I judged from the break in his ton&s;ure, a few &s;cattered white hairs upon his temples being all that remained of it, might be about &s;eventy&mdash;but from his eyes, and that &s;ort of fire which was in them, which &s;eemed more tempered by courte&s;y than years, he could be no more than &s;ixty&mdash;Truth might lie between&mdash;He was certainly &s;ixty-five; and the general air of his coun|tenance, notwith&s;tanding &s;omething &s;eemed to have been planting wrinkles in it before their time, agreed to the account.</P>
<P>It was one of tho&s;e heads which Guido has often painted&mdash;mild, pale,&mdash;penetrating; free from all com|mon-place ideas of fat contented ignorance looking down|wards upon the earth&mdash;it looked forwards; but looked as if it looked at &s;omething beyond this world. How one of his order came by it, Heaven above, who let it fall upon a monk's &s;houlders, be&s;t knows; but it would have &s;uited a Bramin; and had I met it upon it the plains of Indo&s;tan, I had reverenced it.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of his outline may be given in a few &s;trokes: one might put it into the hands of any one to de&s;ign; for it was neither elegant nor otherwi&s;e, but as charac|ter and expre&s;&s;ion made it &s;o; it was a thin, &s;pare form, &s;omething above the common &s;ize, if it lo&s;t not the di&s;tinction by a bend forwards in the figure&mdash;but it was the attitude of intreaty; and, as it now &s;tands pre&s;ent to my imagination, it gained more than it lo&s;t by it.</P>
<P>When he had entered the room three paces, he &s;tood &s;till; and, lying his left hand upon his brea&s;t (a &s;lender white &s;taff with which he journeyed being in his right) &mdash;when I had got clo&s;e up to him, he introduced him|&s;elf with the little &s;tory of the wants of his convent, and the poverty of his order&mdash;and did it with &s;o &s;imple a grace&mdash;and &s;uch an air of deprecation was there in the whole ca&s;t of his look and figure&mdash;I was bewitched not to have been &s;truck with it&mdash;</P>

The monk made me a bow.&mdash;But, re+&s;umed I, the unfortunate of our own country, &s;urely, have the fir&s;t rights; and I have left thou&s;ands in di&s;|tre&s;s upon the Engli&s;h &s;hore&mdash;The monk gave a cordial wave with his head&mdash;as much as to &s;ay, No doubt, there is mi&s;ery enough in every corner of the world, as well as within our convent.&mdash;But we di&s;tingui&s;h, &s;aid I, laying my hand upon the &s;leeve of his tunic, in return for his appeal&mdash;we di&s;tingui&s;h, my good father, betwixt tho&s;e who wi&s;h only to eat the bread of their own labor &mdash;and tho&s;e who eat the bread of other people's, and have no other plan in life, but to get through it in &s;loth and ignorance, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.</P>
<P>The poor Franci&s;can made no reply: a hectic of a moment pa&s;&s;ed acro&s;s his check, but could not tarry&mdash; Nature &s;eemed to have done with her re&s;entments in him; he &s;howed none&mdash;but letting his &s;taff fall within his arm, he pre&s;&s;ed both his hands with re&s;ignation upon his brea&s;t, and retired.</P>

<HEAD>XI. ON THE HEAD-DRESS OF THE LADIES.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not &s;o variable a thing in nature as a lady'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> head-dre&s;s: within my own memory, I have known it ri&s;e and fall above thirty degrees. About ten years ago it &s;hot up to a very great height, in&s;omuch that the female part of our &s;pecies were much taller than the men. The women were of &s;uch an enormous &s;tature, that 'we appeared as gra&s;shoppers before them.' At pre&s;ent the whole &s;ex is in a manner dwarfed and &s;hrunk into a race of beauties that &s;eem almo&s;t another &s;pecies. I remember &s;everal ladies who were once very near &s;e|ven feet high, that at pre&s;ent want &s;ome inches of five: how they came to be thus curtailed, I cannot learn; whether the whole &s;ex be at pre&s;ent under any penance which we know nothing of, or whether they have ca&s;t their head-dre&s;&s;es in order to &s;urpri&s;e us with &s;omething in that kind which &s;hall be entirely new; or whether &s;ome of the talle&s;t of the &s;ex, being too cunning for the re&s;t, have contrived this method to make them&s;elves ap|pear &s;izeable, is &s;till a &s;ecret; though I find mo&s;t are of opinion, they are at pre&s;ent like trees new lopped and pruned, that will certainly &s;prout up and flouri&s;h with greater heads than before. For my own part, as I do not love to be in&s;ulted by women who are taller than my&s;elf, I admire the &s;ex much more in their pre&s;ent humiliation, which has reduced them to their natural dimen&s;ions, than when they had extended their per&s;ons and lengthened them&s;elves out into formidable and gi|gantic figures. I am not for adding to the beautiful
<PB N="126" REF="021451_0125_0FB3F6BD9D54B290">
edifices of nature, nor for rai&s;ing any whim&s;ical &s;uper|&s;tructure upon her plans: I mu&s;t therefore repeat it, that I am highly plea&s;ed with the coiffure now in fa|&s;hion, and think it &s;hows the good &s;en&s;e which at pre|&s;ent very much reigns among the valuable part of the &s;ex. One may ob&s;erve that women in all ages have ta|ken more pains than men to adorn the out&s;ide of their heads; and indeed I very much admire, that tho&s;e ar|chitects, who rai&s;e &s;uch wonderful &s;tructures out of rib|bands, lace, and wire, have not been recorded for their re&s;pective inventions. It is certain there has been as many orders in the&s;e kinds of buildings, as in tho&s;e which have been made of marble; &s;ometimes they ri&s;e in the &s;hape of a pyramid, &s;ometimes like a tower, and &s;ometimes like a &s;teeple. In Juvenal's time, the build|ing grew by &s;everal orders and &s;tories, as he has very humorou&s;ly de&s;cribed it.
<Q><L>With curls on curls they build her head before,</L>
<L>And mount it with a formidable tow'r:</L>
<L>A giante&s;s &s;he &s;eems: but look behind,</L>
<L>And then &s;he dwindles to the pigmy kind.</L></Q>
But I do not remember, in any part of my reading, that the head-dre&s;s a&s;pired to &s;o great an extravagance as in the fourteenth century; when it was built up in a couple of cones or &s;pires, which &s;tood &s;o exce&s;&s;ively high on each &s;ide of the head, that a woman, who was but a pigmy without her head-dre&s;s, appeared like a Colo&s;&s;us upon putting it on. Mon&s;ier Paradin &s;ays,
<Q>That the&s;e old fa&s;hioned fontanges ro&s;e an ell above the head: that they were pointed like &s;teeples, and had long loo&s;e pieces of crape fa&s;tened to the tops of them, which were curiou&s;ly fringed, and hung down their backs like &s;treamers.</Q></P>
<P>The woman might po&s;&s;ibly have carried this Gothic building much higher, had not a famous monk, Thomas Connecte by name, attacked it with great zeal and re|&s;olution. This holy man travelled from place to place to preach down this mon&s;trous commode; and &s;ucceeded &s;o well in it, that, as the magicians &s;acrificed their books to the flames upon the preaching of an apo&s;tle, many of the women threw down their head-dre&s;&s;es in the middle of his &s;ermon, and made a bonfire of them within &s;ight
<PB N="127" REF="021451_0126_0FB3F6BF22B17840">
of the pulpit. He was &s;o renowned, as well for the &s;anc|tity of his life as his manner of preaching, that he had often a congregation of twenty thou&s;and people; the men placing them&s;elves on the one &s;ide of his pulpit, and the women on the other, they appeared, to u&s;e the &s;i|militude of an ingenious writer, like a fore&s;t of cedars with their heads reaching to the clouds. He &s;o warm|ed and animated the people again&s;t the mon&s;trous or|nament, that it lay under a kind of per&s;ecution; and whenever it appeared in public, was pelted down by the rabble, who flung &s;tones at the per&s;ons who wore it. But, notwith&s;tanding this prodigy vani&s;hed while the preacher was among them, it began to appear again &s;ome months after his departure, or, to tell it in Mon|&s;ieur Paradin's own words,
<Q>The women, that, like &s;nails in a fright, had drawn in their horns, &s;hot them out again as &s;oon as the danger was over.</Q>
This ex|travagance of the womens head-dre&s;&s;es in that age is taken notice of by Mon&s;ieur d'Argentre in the hi&s;tory of Bretagne, and by other hi&s;torians as well as the per|&s;on I have here quoted.</P>
<P>It is u&s;ually ob&s;erved, that a good reign is the only proper time for the making of laws again&s;t the exorbi|tance of power; in the &s;ame manner an exce&s;&s;ive head-dre&s;s may be attacked the mo&s;t effectually when the fa|&s;hion is again&s;t it. I do therefore recommend this pa|per to my female readers by way of prevention.</P>
<P>I would de&s;ire the fair &s;ex to con&s;ider how impo&s;&s;ible it is for them to add any thing that can be ornamental to what is already the ma&s;ter-piece of nature. The head has the mo&s;t beautiful appearance, as well as the highe&s;t &s;tation, in the human figure. Nature has laid out all her art in beautifying the face; &s;he has touched it with vermilion, planted in it a double row of ivory, made it the &s;eat of &s;miles and blu&s;hes, lighted it up and enliven|ed it with the brightne&s;s of the eyes, hung it on each &s;ide with curious organs of &s;en&s;e, given it airs and graces that cannot be de&s;cribed, and &s;urrounded it with &s;uch a flowing &s;hade of hair, as &s;ets all its beauties in the mo&s;t agreeable light: in &s;hort, &s;he &s;eems to have de&s;ign|ed the head as the cupola to the mo&s;t glorious of her works; and, when we load it with &s;uch a pile of &s;uper|numerary

<HEAD>XII. ON THE PRESENT AND A FUTURE STATE.</HEAD>
<P>A LEWD young fellow &s;eeing an aged hermit go by him barefoot, "Father," &s;ays he, "you are in a very mi&s;erable condition if there is not another world." "True, &s;on," &s;aid the hermit; "but what is thy con|dition if there is?"&mdash; Man is a creature de&s;igned for two different &s;tates of being, or rather for two different lives. His fir&s;t life is &s;hort and tran&s;ient; his &s;econd perma|nent and la&s;ting. The que&s;tion we are all concerned in is this, In which of the&s;e two lives it is our chief inte|re&s;t to make our&s;elves happy? Or, in other words, Whether we &s;hould endeavor to &s;ecure to our&s;elves the plea&s;ures and gratifications of a life which is uncertain and precarious, and at its utmo&s;t length of a very in|con&s;iderable duration; or to &s;ecure to our&s;elves the plea|&s;ures of a life which is fixed and &s;ettled, and will never end? Every man, upon the fir&s;t hearing of this que|&s;tion, knows very well which &s;ide of it he ought to clo&s;e with. But, however right we are in theory, it is plain that in practice we adhere to the wrong &s;ide of the que&s;tion. We make provi&s;ion for this life as though it were never to have an end; and for the other life, as though it were never to have a beginning.</P>
<P>Should a &s;pirit of &s;uperior rank, who is a &s;tranger to human nature, accidentally alight upon the earth, and take a &s;urvey of its inhabitants; what would his notions of us be? Would not he think that we are a &s;pecies of beings made for quite different ends and pur|po&s;es than what we really are? Mu&s;t not he imagine that we were placed in this world to get riches and ho|nors? Would not he think that it was our duty to toil after wealth, and &s;tation, and title? Nay, would not he believe we were forbidden poverty by threats of eternal puni&s;hment, and enjoyed to pur&s;ue our plea&s;ures under pain of damnation? He would certainly imagine that we were influenced by a &s;cheme of duties quite op|po&s;ite to tho&s;e which are indeed pre&s;cribed to us. And,
<PB N="129" REF="021451_0128_0FB3F6C21DEECBC8">
truly, according to &s;uch an imagination, he mu&s;t con|clude, that we are a &s;pecies of the mo&s;t obedient crea|tures in the univer&s;e; that we are con&s;tant to our duty; and that we keep a &s;teady eye on the end for which we were &s;ent hither.</P>
<P>But how great would be his a&s;toni&s;hment, when he learnt that we were beings not de&s;igned to exi&s;t in this world above three&s;core and ten years; and that the greate&s;t part of the&s;e bu&s;y &s;pecies fall &s;hort even of that age? How would he be lo&s;t in horror and admiration, when he &s;hould know that this &s;et of creatures, who lay out all their endeavors for this life, which &s;carce de|&s;erves the name of exi&s;tence, when, I &s;ay, he &s;hould know that this &s;et of creatures are to exi&s;t to all eternity in another life, for which they make no preparations? Nothing can be a greater di&s;grace to rea&s;on, than that men, who are per&s;uaded of the&s;e two different &s;tates of being, &s;hould be perpetually employed in providing for a life of three&s;core and ten years, and neglecting to make provi&s;ion for that, which, after many myriads of years, will be &s;till new and &s;till beginning; e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that our endeavors for making our&s;elves great, or rich, or honorable, or whatever el&s;e we place our happine&s;s in, may after all prove un&s;ucce&s;sful; whereas if we con&s;tantly and &s;incerely endeavor to make our|&s;elves happy in the other life, we are &s;ure that our en|deavors will &s;ucceed, and that we &s;hall not be di&s;ap|pointed of our hope.</P>
<P>The following que&s;tion is &s;tarted by one of the &s;chool-men. Suppo&s;ing the whole body of the earth were a great ball or ma&s;s of the fine&s;t &s;and, and that a &s;ingle grain or particle of this &s;and would be annihilated every thou&s;and years? Suppo&s;ing then that you had it in your choice to be happy all the while this prodigious ma&s;s of &s;and was con&s;uming by this &s;low method until there was not a grain of it left, on condition you were to be mi&s;erable for ever after? or, &s;uppo&s;ing that you might be happy for ever after, on condition you would be mi&s;erable until the whole ma&s;s of &s;and were thus an|nihilated at the rate of one &s;and in a thou&s;and years; which of the&s;e two ca&s;es would you make your choice?</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, in this ca&s;e, &s;o many thou&s;ands
<PB N="130" REF="021451_0129_0FB3F6C39CA7AD98">
of years are to the imagination as a kind of eternity, though in reality they do not bear &s;o great a proportion to that duration which is to follow them, as an unit does to the greate&s;t number which you can put together in figures, or as one of tho&s;e &s;ands to the &s;uppo&s;ed heap. Rea&s;on therefore tells us, without any manner of he&s;ita|tion, which would be the better part in this choice. However, as I have before intimated, our rea&s;on might, in &s;uch ca&s;e, be &s;o over&s;et by the imagination, as to di&s;|po&s;e &s;ome per&s;ons to &s;ink under the con&s;ideration of the great length of the fir&s;t part of this duration, and of the great di&s;tance of that &s;econd duration which is to &s;uc|ceed it; the mind, I &s;ay, might give it&s;elf up to that happine&s;s which is at hand, con&s;idering that it is &s;o very near, and that it would la&s;t &s;o very long. But when the choice we actually have before us is this, Whether we will choo&s;e to be happy for the &s;pace of only three-&s;core and ten, nay perhaps of only twenty or ten years, I might &s;ay of only a day or an hour, and mi&s;erable to all eternity; or, on the contrary, mi&s;erable for this &s;hort term of years, and happy for a whole eternity; what words are &s;ufficient to expre&s;s that folly and want of con&s;ideration which in &s;uch a ca&s;e makes a wrong choice!</P>
<P>I here put the ca&s;e even at the wor&s;t, by &s;uppo&s;ing what &s;eldom happens, that a cour&s;e of virtue makes us mi&s;erable in this life: but if we &s;uppo&s;e, as it generally happens, that virtue would make us more happy even in this life than a contrary cour&s;e of vice; how can we &s;ufficiently admire the &s;tupidity or madne&s;s of tho&s;e per|&s;ons who are capable of making &s;o ab&s;urd a choice?</P>
<P>Every wi&s;e man therefore will con&s;ider this life only as it may conduce to the happine&s;s of the other, and cheerfully &s;acrifice the plea&s;ures of a few years to tho&s;e of an eternity.</P>

<HEAD>XIII. STORY OF THE SIEGE OF CALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>EDWARD III. after the battle of Cre&s;&s;y, laid &s;iege to Calais. He had fortified his camp in &s;o impregna|ble a manner, that all the efforts of France proved ineffectual to rai&s;e the &s;iege, or throw &s;uccours into the city.&mdash;The citizens, under Count Vienne, their gallant governor, made an admirable defence.&mdash;France had now
<PB N="131" REF="021451_0130_0FB3F6C51D78E818">
put the &s;ickle into her &s;econd harve&s;t, &s;ince Edward, with his victorious army, &s;at down before the town. The eyes of all Europe were intent on the i&s;&s;ue. At length, famine did more for Edward than arms.&mdash;Af|ter &s;uffering unheard-of calamities, they re&s;olved to at|tempt the enemy's camp.&mdash;They boldly &s;allied forth: The Engli&s;h joined battle; and, after a long and de&s;|perate engagement, Count Vienne was taken pri&s;oner, and the citizens who &s;urvived the &s;laughter retired with|in their gates. The command devolving upon Eu&s;tace St Pierre, a man of mean birth but of exalted virtue, he offered to capitulate with Edward, provided he per|mitted them to depart with life and liberty. Edward, to avoid the imputation of cruelty, con&s;ented to &s;pare the bulk of the plebeians, provided they delivered up to him &s;ix of their principal citizens with halters about their necks, as victims of due atonement for that &s;pirit of re|bellion with which they had inflamed the vulgar. When his me&s;&s;enger, Sir Walter Mauny, delivered the terms, con&s;ternation and pale di&s;may were impre&s;&s;ed on every countenance.&mdash;To a long and dead &s;ilence deep &s;ighs and groans &s;ucceeded, till Eu&s;tace St Pierre getting up to a little eminence, thus addre&s;&s;ed the a&s;&s;embly:&mdash; "My friends, we are brought to great &s;traits this day. We mu&s;t either yield to the terms of our cruel and en|&s;naring conqueror, or yield up our tender infants, our wives, and daughters, to the bloody and brutal lu&s;ts of the violating &s;oldiers. Is there any expedient left, whereby we may avoid the guilt and infamy of deliver|ing up tho&s;e (who have &s;uffered every mi&s;ery with you) on the one hand, or the de&s;olation and horror of a &s;ack|ed city on the other? There is, my friends, there is one expedient left, a gracious, an excellent, a godlike expedient! Is there any here to whom virtue is dearer than life? Let him offer him&s;elf an oblation for the &s;afety of his people! He &s;hall not fail of a ble&s;&s;ed ap|probation from that Power, who offered up his only Son for the &s;alvation of mankind." He &s;poke;&mdash;but an uni|ver&s;al &s;ilence en&s;ued.&mdash;Each man looked around for the example of that virtue and magnanimity which all wi&s;h|ed to approve in them&s;elves, though they wanted the re|&s;olution. At length St Pierre re&s;umed, "I doubt not
<PB N="132" REF="021451_0131_0FB3F6C69D709348">
but there are many here as ready, nay, more zealous, of his martyrdom than I can be; though the &s;tation to which I am rai&s;ed, by the captivity of Lord Vienne, imparts a right to be the fir&s;t in giving my life for your &s;akes. I give it freely; I give it cheerfully. Who comes next?" "Your &s;on," exclaimed a youth not yet come to maturity.&mdash;"Ah, my child!" cried St Pierre; "I am then twice &s;acrificed.&mdash;But, no: I have rather begotten thee a &s;econd time. Thy years are few, but full, my &s;on. The victim of virtue has reached the ut|mo&s;t purpo&s;e and goal of mortality. Who next, my friends? This is the hour of heroes." "Your kin&s;|man." cried John de Aire. "Your kin&s;man," cried James Wi&s;&s;ant. "Your kin&s;man," cried Peter Wi&s;&s;ant. &mdash;Ah!" exclaimed Sir Walter Mauny, bur&s;ting into tears, "why was not I a citizen of Calais!" The &s;ixth victim was &s;till wanting, but was quickly &s;upplied by lot from numbers who were now emulous of &s;o enno|bling an example. The keys of the city were then de|livered to Sir Walter. He took the &s;ix pri&s;oners into his cu&s;tody; then ordered the gates to be opened, and gave charge to his attendants to conduct the remaining citizens, with their families, through the camp of the Engli&s;h. Before they departed, however, they de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to take their la&s;t adieu of their deliverers. What a parting! what a &s;cene! They crowded, with their wives and children, about St Pierre and his fel|low-pri&s;oners. They embraced; they clung around; they fell pro&s;trate before them. They groaned; they wept aloud; and the joint clamor of their mourning pa&s;&s;ed the gates of the city, and was heard throughout the Engli&s;h camp. The Engli&s;h, by this time, were appri&s;ed of what pa&s;&s;ed within Calais. They heard the voice of lamentation, and their &s;ouls were touched with compa&s;&s;ion. Each of the &s;oldiers prepared a portion of his own victuals to welcome and entertain the half-fami&s;hed inhabitants; and they loaded them with as much as their pre&s;ent weakne&s;s was able to bear, in or|der to &s;upply them with &s;u&s;tenance by the way. At length St Pierre and his fellow-victims appeared under the conduct of Sir Walter and a guard. All the tents of the Engli&s;h were in&s;tantly emptied The &s;oldiers
<PB N="133" REF="021451_0132_0FB3F6C81E1AE8C0">
poured from all parts, and arranged them&s;elves on each &s;ide, to behold, to contemplate, to admire, this little band of patriots as they pa&s;&s;ed. They bowed down to them on all &s;ides. They murmured their applau&s;e of that virtue, which they could not but revere even in enemies; and they regarded tho&s;e ropes which they had volunta|rily a&s;&s;umed about their necks, as en&s;igns of greater dignity than that of the Briti&s;h garter. As &s;oon as they had reached the pre&s;ence, "Mauny," &s;ays the monarch, "are the&s;e the principal inhabitants of Calais?"&mdash; "They are," &s;ays Mauny: "they are not only the principal men of Calais, they are the principal men of France, my Lord, if virtue has any &s;hare in the act of ennobling." "Were they delivered peaceably?" &s;ays Edward, "Was there no re&s;i&s;tance, no commotion among the people?" "Not in the lea&s;t, my Lord; the people would all have peri&s;hed, rather than have deliver|ed the lea&s;t of the&s;e to your Maje&s;ty. They are &s;elf-delivered, &s;elf-devoted, and come to offer up their in|e&s;timable heads as an ample equivalent for the ran&s;om of thou&s;ands." Edward was &s;ecretly piqued at this re|ply of Sir Walter; but he knew the privilege of a Bri|ti&s;h &s;ubject, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment. "Expe|rience," &s;ays he, "has ever &s;hown, that lenity only &s;erves to invite people to new crimes. Severity, at times, is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to compel &s;ubjects to &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion by puni&s;hment and example. Go," he cried to an officer, "lead the&s;e men to execution. Your rebellion," continued he addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to St. Pierre, "your rebellion again&s;t me, the natural heir of your crown, is highly aggravated by your pre&s;ent pre&s;umption and af|front of my power."&mdash;"We have nothing to a&s;k of your Maje&s;ty," &s;aid Eu&s;tace, "&s;ave what you cannot refu&s;e us."&mdash;"What is that?" "Your e&s;teem, my Lord," &s;aid Eu&s;tace; and went out with his companions.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant a &s;ound of triumph was head through|out the camp. The Queen had ju&s;t arrived with a pow|erful reinforcement of gallant troops. Sir Walter Mau|ny flew to receive her Maje&s;ty, and briefly informed her of the particulars re&s;pecting the &s;ix victims.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he had been welcomed by Edward and his court, &s;he de&s;ired a private audience. "My Lord,"

&s;aid &s;he, "the que&s;tion I am to enter upon, is not touching the lives of a few mechanics&mdash; it re&s;pects the honor of the Engli&s;h nation; it re&s;pects the glory of my Edward, my hu&s;band, my king.&mdash;You think you have &s;entenced &s;ix of your enemies to death. No, my Lord, they have &s;entenced them&s;elves; and their execution would be the execution of their own orders, not the orders of Edward.</P>
<P>"They have behaved them&s;elves worthily; they have behaved them&s;elves greatly: and I cannot but re&s;pect, while I envy them, for leaving us no &s;hare in the honor of this action, &s;ave that of granting a poor, an indi&s;pen|&s;ible pardon. I admit they have de&s;erved every thing that is evil at your hands. They have proved the mo&s;t inveterate and ob&s;tinate of your enemies. They a|lone have with&s;tood the rapid cour&s;e of your conque&s;ts, and have with-held from you the crown to which you were born. Is it therefore that you would reward them? that you would gratify their de&s;ires, that you would in|dulge their ambition, and enwreath them with everla&s;t|ing glory and applau&s;e? But if &s;uch a death would ex|alt mechanics over the fame of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious heroes, how would the name of Edward, with all his triumphs, be tarni&s;hed thereby? Would it not be &s;aid, that mag|nanimity and virtue are grown odious in the eyes of the monarch of Britain? and that the objects whom he de|&s;tines to the puni&s;hment of felons, are the very men who de&s;erve the prai&s;e and e&s;teem of mankind?

<HEAD>I. ON GRACE IN WRITING.</HEAD>
<P>I Will not undertake to mark out with any &s;ort of pre|ci&s;ion, that idea which I would expre&s;s by the word Grace: and, perhaps, it can no more be clearly de&s;cri|bed than ju&s;tly defined. To give you, however, a ge|neral intimation of what I mean when I apply that term to compo&s;itions of genius, I would re&s;emble it to that ea&s;y air which &s;o remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hes certain per|&s;ons of a genteel and liberal ca&s;t. It con&s;i&s;ts not only in the particular beauty of &s;ingle parts, but ari&s;es from the general &s;ymmetry and con&s;truction of the whole. An author may be ju&s;t in his &s;entiments, lively in his figures, and clear in his expre&s;&s;ion; yet may have no claim to be admitted in the rank of fini&s;hed writers. The &s;everal members mu&s;t be &s;o agreeably united, as mutually to reflect beauty upon each other; their a|rangement mu&s;t be &s;o happily di&s;po&s;ed as not to admit of the lea&s;t tran&s;po&s;ition, without manife&s;t prejudice to the entire piece. The thoughts, the metaphors, the allu&s;ions, and the diction, &s;hould appear ea&s;y and natu|ral, and &s;eem to ari&s;e like &s;o many &s;pontaneous produc|tions, rather than as the effects of art or labor.</P>
<P>Whatever, therefore, is forced or affected in the &s;en|timents; whatever is pompous or pedantic in the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, is the very rever&s;e of Grace. Her mien is neither that of a prude nor a coquette; &s;he is regular without formality, and &s;prightly without being fanta&s;ti|cal. Grace, in &s;hort, is to good writing what a proper light is to a fine picture; it not only &s;hows all the fi|gures in their &s;everal proportions and relations, but &s;hows them in the mo&s;t advantageous manner.</P>
<P>As gentility (to re&s;ume my former illu&s;tration) ap|pears in the minute&s;t action, and improves the mo&s;t in|con&s;iderable ge&s;ture; &s;o grace is di&s;covered in the pla|cing even a &s;ingle word, or the turn of a mere expletive. Neither is this inexpre&s;&s;ible quality confined to one &s;pe|cies
<PB N="137" REF="021451_0136_0FB3F6CE23727680">
of compo&s;ition only, but extends to all the various kinds; to the humble pa&s;toral as well as to the lofty e|pic; from the &s;lighte&s;t letter to the mo&s;t &s;olemn di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I know not whether Sir William Temple may not be con&s;idered as the fir&s;t of our pro&s;e authors, who intro|duced a graceful manner into our language. At lea&s;t that quality does not &s;eem to have appeared early, or &s;pread far, among&s;t us. But where&s;oever we may look for its origin, it is certainly to be found in its highe&s;t perfection in the e&s;&s;ays of a gentleman who&s;e writings will be di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;o long as politene&s;s and good &s;en&s;e have any admirers. That becoming air which Tully e&s;teemed the criterion of fine compo&s;ition, and which every reader, he &s;ays, imagines &s;o ea&s;y to be imitated, yet will find &s;o difficult to attain, is the prevailing cha|racteri&s;tic of all that excellent author's mo&s;t elegant per|formances. In a word, one may ju&s;tly apply to him what Plato, in his allegorical language, &s;ays of Ari&s;to|phanes; that the Graces, having &s;earched all the world round for a temple wherein they might for ever dwell, &s;ettled at la&s;t in the brea&s;t of Mr Addi&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>II. ON FEMALE ORATORY.</HEAD>
<P>WE are told by &s;ome ancient authors, that Socrates was in&s;tructed in eloquence by a woman, who&s;e name, if I am not mi&s;taken, was A&s;pa&s;ia. I have indeed very often looked upon that art as the mo&s;t proper for the female &s;ex; and I think the univer&s;ities would do well to con&s;ider whether they &s;hould not fill the rhetoric chairs with &s;he-profe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid in the prai&s;e of &s;ome men, that they could talk whole hours together upon any thing; but it mu&s;t be owned to the honor of the other &s;ex, that there are many among them who can talk whole hours toge|ther upon nothing. I have known a woman branch out into a long extempore di&s;&s;ertation upon the edging of a petticoat, and chide her &s;ervant for breaking a china-cup, in all the figures of rhetoric.</P>
<P>Were woman admitted to plead in courts of judica|ture, I am per&s;uaded they would carry the eloquence of the bar to greater heights than it has yet arrived at. If
<PB N="138" REF="021451_0137_0FB3F6CF9ED9C038">
any one doubts this, let him but be pre&s;ent at tho&s;e de|bates which frequently ari&s;e among the ladies of the Briti&s;h fi&s;hery.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t kind, therefore, of female orators which I &s;hall take notice of, are tho&s;e who are employed in &s;tir|ring up the pa&s;&s;ions; a part of rhetoric in which Socra|tes's wife had perhaps made a greater proficiency than his above-mentioned teacher.</P>
<P>The &s;econd kind of female orators, are tho&s;e who deal in invectives and who are commonly known by the name of the cen&s;orious. The imagination and elocution of this &s;et of rhetoricians is wonderful. With what a fluency of invention, and copiou&s;ne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, will they enlarge upon every little &s;lip in the behavior of another? With how many different circum&s;tances, and with what variety of phra&s;es, they will tell over the &s;ame &s;tory? I have known an old lady make an un|happy marriage the &s;ubject of a month's conver&s;ation. She blamed the bride in one place, pitied her in ano|ther, laughed at her in a third, wondered at her in the fourth, was angry at her in a fifth; and in &s;hort, wore out a pair of coach-hor&s;es in expre&s;&s;ing her concern for her. At length, after having quite exhau&s;ted the &s;ub|ject on this &s;ide, &s;he made a vi&s;it to the new-married pair, prai&s;ed the wife for the prudent choice &s;he had made, told her the unrea&s;onable reflections which &s;ome malicious people had ca&s;t upon her, and de&s;ired that they might be better acquainted. The cen&s;ure and ap|probation of this kind of women are therefore only to be con&s;idered as helps to di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>A third kind of female orators may be comprehended under the word Go&s;&s;ips. Mrs. Fiddle-Faddle is perfect|ly accompli&s;hed in this &s;ort of eloquence; &s;he launches out into de&s;criptions of chri&s;tenings, runs divi&s;ions up|on an head-dre&s;s, knows every di&s;h of meat that is &s;erv|ed up in her neighborhood, and entertains her company a whole afternoon together with the wit of her little boy, before he is able to &s;peak.</P>
<P>The coquette may be looked upon as a fourth kind of female orator. To give her&s;elf the larger field for di&s;cour&s;e &s;he hates and loves in the &s;ame breath, talks to her lap-dog or parrot, is unea&s;y in all kinds of wea|ther,
<PB N="139" REF="021451_0138_0FB3F6D11C602518">
and in every part of the room; &s;he has fal&s;e quar|rels and feigned obligations to all the men of her ac|quaintance? &s;ighs when &s;he is not &s;ad, and laughs when &s;he is not merry. The coquette is in particular a great mi&s;tre&s;s of that part of oratory which is called action; and indeed &s;eems to &s;peak for no other purpo&s;e but as it gives her an opportunity of &s;tirring a limb or varying a feature, of glancing her eyes or playing with her fan.</P>
<P>As for new&s;mongers, politicians, mimics, &s;tory-tellers, with other characters of that nature which give birth to loquacity, they are as commonly found among the men as the women; for which rea&s;on I &s;hall pa&s;s them over in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>I have often been puzzled to a&s;&s;ign a cau&s;e why wo|men &s;hould have this talent of a ready utterance in &s;o much greater perfection than men. I have &s;ometimes fancied they that have not a retentive power, or the fa|culty of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing their thoughts, as men have; but that they are nece&s;&s;itated to &s;peak every thing they think; and if &s;o, it would perhaps furni&s;h a very &s;trong argu|ment to the Carte&s;ians for the &s;upporting of their doc|trine, that the &s;oul always thinks. But as &s;everal are of opinion, that the fair &s;ex are not altogether &s;trangers to the art of di&s;&s;embling and concealing their thoughts, I have been forced to relinqui&s;h that opinion; and have therefore endeavored, to &s;eek after &s;ome better rea&s;on. In order to it, a friend of mine, who is an excellent a|natomi&s;t, has promi&s;ed me, by the fir&s;t opportunity, to di&s;&s;ect a woman's tongue, and to examine whether there may not be in it certain juices which render it &s;o won|derfully voluble or flippant; or whether the fibres of it may not be made up of a finer or more pliant thread; or whether there are not in it &s;ome particular mu&s;cles which dart it up and down by &s;uch &s;udden glances and vibrations; or whether, in the la&s;t place, there may not be &s;ome certain undi&s;covered channels running from the head and the heart to this little in&s;trument of loquacity, and conveying into it a perpetual affluence of animal &s;pirits. Nor mu&s;t I omit the rea&s;on which Hudibras has given, why tho&s;e who can talk on trifles &s;peak with the greate&s;t fluency; namely, that the tongue is like a
<PB N="140" REF="021451_0139_0FB3F6D29D1E48E0">
race-hor&s;e, which runs the fa&s;ter the le&s;s weight it car|ries.</P>
<P>Which of the&s;e rea&s;ons &s;oever may be looked upon as the mo&s;t probable, I think the Iri&s;hman's thought was very natural, who, after &s;ome hours conver&s;ation with a female orator, told her, that he believed her tongue was very glad when &s;he was a&s;leep, for that it had not a moment's re&s;t all the while &s;he was awake.</P>
<P>That excellent old ballad of the Wanton Wife of Bath, has the following remarkable lines:
<Q><L>I think, quoth Thomas, women's tongues</L>
<L>Of A&s;pen leaves are made.</L></Q></P>
<P>And Ovid, though in the de&s;cription of a very barba|rous circum&s;tance, tells us, That when the tongue of a beautiful female was cut out, and thrown upon the ground, it could not forbear muttering even in that po&s;|ture.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;The blade had cut</L>
<L>Her tongue &s;heer off, clo&s;e to the trembling root;</L>
<L>The mangled part &s;till quiver'd on the ground,</L>
<L>Murmuring with a faint imperfect &s;ound</L>
<L>And as a &s;erpent wreaths his wounded train,</L>
<L>Unea&s;y panting, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with pain.</L></Q>
<P>If a tongue would be talking without a mouth, what could it have done when it had all its organ's of &s;peech, and accomplices of &s;ound about it? I might here men|tion the &s;tory of the pippin-women, had I not &s;ome rea|&s;on to look upon it as fabulous.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am &s;o wonderfully charmed with the mu&s;ic of this little in&s;trument, that I would by no means di&s;courage it. All that I aim at by this di&s;&s;ertation is, to cure it of &s;everal di&s;agreeable notes, and in particu|lar of tho&s;e little jarrings and di&s;&s;onances which ari&s;e from anger, cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, go&s;&s;ipping, and coquetry. In &s;hort, I would always have it tuned by good nature, truth, di&s;cretion, and &s;incerity.</P>

If he, who &s;urveys an academy, a pa|lace, or a court of ju&s;tice, and ob&s;erves regularity, order, and oeconomy, prevailing in them, is immediately con|vinced that this regularity, mu&s;t be the effect of authority and di&s;cipline, &s;upported by per&s;ons properly qualified; how much more rea&s;on has he, who finds him&s;elf &s;ur|rounded by &s;o many and &s;uch &s;tupendous bodies, per|forming their various revolutions without the lea&s;t deviation from perfect regularity, through the innumer|able ages of pa&s;t duration; how much more rea&s;on has he to conclude, that &s;uch amazing revolutions are go|verned by &s;uperior wi&s;dom and power?</P>
<P>Is it not therefore a&s;toni&s;hing, that any man &s;hould ever have dreamed of the po&s;&s;ibility that a beautiful and magnificent &s;y&s;tem might ari&s;e from the fortuitous con|cour&s;e of certain bodies, carried towards one another by I know not what imaginary impul&s;e? I &s;ee not why he who is capable of a&s;cribing the production of a world to a cau&s;e &s;o inadequate, may not expect, from the fortui|tous &s;cattering about of a &s;et of letters of ivory or me|tal, a regular hi&s;tory to appear. But I believe he who hopes to produce, in this way, one &s;ingle line, will find him&s;elf for ever di&s;appointed. If the ca&s;ual concour&s;e of atoms has produced a whole univer&s;e, how comes it that we never find a city, a temple, or &s;o much as a por|tico, produced in the &s;ame manner? One would ima|gine they who prate &s;o ab&s;urdly about the origination of the world, had no eyes, or had never opened them, to view the glories of the immen&s;e theatre.</P>
<P>The rea&s;onings of Ari&s;totle on this point are excellent. &mdash;"Let us &s;uppo&s;e," &s;ays he, "certain per&s;ons to have been born, and to have lived to mature age, under ground, in habitations accommodated with all the con|veniences and even magnificences of life, except the &s;ight of this upper world. Let us &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e per&s;ons to have heard, by fame, of &s;uperior beings, and won|derful effects produced by them.

Let them behold the &s;un, and ob&s;erve his tran&s;cendent brightne&s;s and wonderful influence as he pours down the flood of day over the whole earth, from ea&s;t to we&s;t. And when night co|vered the world in darkne&s;s, let them behold the heavens adorned with innumerable &s;tars. Let them behold the various appearances of the moon; now horned, then full, then decrea&s;ing.

<P>THE darts of adver&s;e fortune are always levelled at our heads. Some reach us; &s;ome graze again&s;t us, and fly to wound our neighbors. Let us therefore im|po&s;e an equal temper on our minds, and pay without murmuring the tribute which we owe to humanity. The winter brings cold and we mu&s;t freeze.

The be&s;t re&s;olution we can take is to &s;uffer with patience what we cannot alter; and pur&s;ue without repining, the road which Providence, who directs every thing, has marked out to us: for it is not enough to follow; and he is but a bad &s;oldier who &s;ighs and marches on with reluctancy. We mu&s;t receive the orders with &s;pirit and cheerfulne&s;s, and not endeavor to &s;link out of the po&s;t which is a&s;&s;igned us in this beautiful di&s;po&s;ition of things, whereof even our &s;uf|fering make a nece&s;&s;ary part.

<P>THE advantages found in hi&s;tory &s;eem to be of three kinds: as it amu&s;es the fancy, as it improves the under|&s;tanding, and as it &s;trengthens virtue.</P>
<P>In reality, what more agreeable entertainment to the mind than to be tran&s;ported into the remote&s;t ages of the world, and to ob&s;erve human &s;ociety, in its infancy, making the fir&s;t faint e&s;&s;ays towards the arts and &s;cien|ces? To &s;ee the policy of government and the civility of conver&s;ation refining by degrees, and every thing that is ornamental to human life advancing towards its perfec|tion? To mark the ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and declen&s;ion, and final extinction of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing empires; the virtues which contributed to their greatne&s;s, and the vices which drew
<PB N="144" REF="021451_0143_0FB3F6D89ECA2808">
on their ruin? In &s;hort, to &s;ee all the human race, from the beginning of time, pa&s;s as it were in review before us, appearing in their true colors, without any of tho&s;e di&s;|gui&s;es, which, during their lifetime, &s;o much perplexed the judgments of the beholders? What &s;pectacle can be imagined &s;o magnificent, &s;o various, &s;o intere&s;ting? What amu&s;ement, either of the &s;en&s;es or imagination, can be compared with it?

How perver&s;e mu&s;t that ta&s;te be which is capable of &s;o wrong a choice of plea&s;ures?</P>
<P>But hi&s;tory is a mo&s;t improving part of knowledge, as well as an agreeable amu&s;ement; and indeed a great part of what we commonly call erudition, and value &s;o highly, is nothing but an acquaintance with hi&s;torical facts. An exten&s;ive knowledge of this kind belongs to men of letters; but I mu&s;t think it an unpardonable ig|norance in per&s;ons, of whatever &s;ex or condition, not to be acquainted with the hi&s;tory of their own country a|long with the hi&s;tories of ancient Greece and Rome.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t add, that hi&s;tory is not only a valuable part of knowledge, but opens the door to many other parts of knowledge, and affords materials to mo&s;t of the &s;cien|ces. And indeed, if we con&s;ider the &s;hortne&s;s of human life, and our limited knowledge, even of what pa&s;&s;es in our own time, we mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that we &s;hould be for ever children in under&s;tanding, were it not for this in|vention, which ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ends our experience to all pa&s;t ages, and to the mo&s;t di&s;tant nations: making them contribute as much to our improvement in wi&s;dom, as if they had actually lain under our ob&s;ervation.

<P>There is al&s;o an advantage in that knowledge which is acquired by hi&s;tory, above what is learned by the prac|tice of the world, that it brings us acquainted with hu|man affairs, without dimini&s;hing in the lea&s;t from the mo&s;t delicate &s;entiments of virtue. And, to tell the truth, I &s;carce know any &s;tudy or occupation &s;o unexcep|tionable
<PB N="145" REF="021451_0144_0FB3F6DA96F7A380">
as hi&s;tory in this particular. Poets can paint virtue in the mo&s;t charming colors? but, as they addre&s;s them&s;elves entirely to the pa&s;&s;ions, they often become advocates for vice. Even philo&s;ophers are apt to bewil|der them&s;elves in the &s;ubtilty of their &s;peculations; and we have &s;een &s;ome go &s;o far as to deny the reality of all moral di&s;tinctions. But I think it a remark worthy the attention of the &s;peculative reader, that the hi&s;torians have been, almo&s;t without exception, the true friends of virtue, and have always repre&s;ented it in its proper co|lors, however they may have erred in their judgments of particular per&s;ons. Nor is this combination of hi&s;to|rians in favor of virtue at all difficult to be accounted for. When a man of bu&s;ine&s;s enters into life and ac|tion, he is more apt to con&s;ider the characters of men as they have relation to his intere&s;t than as they &s;tand in them&s;elves, and has his judgment warped on every oc|ca&s;ion by the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion. When a philo&s;o|pher contemplates characters and manners in his clo&s;et, the general ab&s;tract view of the objects leaves the mind &s;o cold and unmoved, that the &s;entiments of nature have no room to play, and he &s;carce feels the difference be|twixt vice and virtue. Hi&s;tory keeps in a ju&s;t medium betwixt the&s;e extremes, and places the objects in their true point of view. The writers of hi&s;tory, as well as the readers, are &s;ufficiently intere&s;ted in the characters and events, to have a lively &s;entiment of blame or prai&s;e; and, at the &s;ame time, have no particular intere&s;t or concern to pervert their judgment.</P>

<HEAD>VI. BATTLE of PHARSALIA and DEATH of POMPEY.</HEAD>
<P>CAESAR had employed all his art for &s;ome time in &s;ounding the inclinations of his men; and finding his ar|my once more re&s;olute and vigorous, he cau&s;ed them to advance towards the plains of Phar&s;alia, where Pompey was now encamped, and prepared to oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P>The approach of the&s;e two great armies, compo&s;ed of the be&s;t and brave&s;t troops in the world, together with the greatne&s;s of the prize for which they contend|ed, filled all minds with anxiety, though with different expectations. Pompey's army, being mo&s;t numerous, turned all their thoughts to the enjoyment of the vic|tory;
<PB N="146" REF="021451_0145_0FB3F6DB9D059890">
Cae&s;ar's, with better aims, con&s;idered only the means of obtaining it: Pompey's army depended upon their numbers and their many generals; Cae&s;ar's, upon their own di&s;cipline, and the conduct of their &s;ingle commander: Pompey's partizans hoped much from the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e; Cae&s;ar's alleging the frequent propo&s;als which they had made for peace without effect. Thus, the views, hopes, and motives of both &s;eemed different, but their hatred and ambition were the &s;ame. Cae&s;ar, who was ever foremo&s;t in offering battle, led out his army in array to meet the enemy; but Pompey, either &s;u&s;pecting his troops, or dreading the event, kept his advantageous &s;ituation for &s;ome time: he drew in|deed &s;ometimes out of his camp, but always kept him|&s;elf under his trenches, at the foot of the hill near which he was po&s;ted. Cae&s;ar, being unwilling to attack him at a di&s;advantage, re&s;olved to decamp the next day, hop|ing to hara&s;s out his antagoni&s;h, who was not a match for him in &s;u&s;taining the fatigues of duty. According|ly the order for marching was given, and the tents &s;truck, when word was brought him that Pompey's ar|my had quitted their entrenchments, and had advanced farther into the plain than u&s;ual, &s;o that he might en|gage them at le&s;s di&s;advantage: whereupon he cau&s;ed his troops that were upon their march to halt, and with a countenance of joy, informed them, that the happy time was at la&s;t come which they had &s;o long wi&s;hed for, and which was to crown their glory and ter|minate their fatigues. Upon this he drew up his troops in order, and advanced towards the place of battle. His forces did not amount to above half tho&s;e of Pompey; the army of the one amounting to above forty-five thou|&s;and foot and &s;even thou&s;and hor&s;e; that of the other not exceeding twenty-two thou&s;and foot and about a thou&s;and hor&s;e. This di&s;proportion, particularly in the cavalry, had filled Cae&s;ar with apprehen&s;ions: wherefore he had &s;ome days before picked out the &s;tronge&s;t and nimble&s;t of his foot &s;oldiers, and accu&s;tomed them to fight between the ranks of his cavalry. By their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance his thou&s;and hor&s;e was a match for Pompey's &s;e|ven thou&s;and, and had actually got the better in a &s;kir|mi&s;h that happened between them &s;ome days before.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="021451_0146_0FB3F6DD240E9358">Pompey, on the other hand, had &s;trong expectations of &s;ucce&s;s: he boa&s;ted that he could put Cae&s;ar's legions to flight without &s;triking a &s;ingle blow; pre&s;uming, that, as &s;oon as the armies formed, his cavalry, on which he placed his greate&s;t expectations, would outflank and &s;urround the enemy. Labienus commended this &s;cheme of Pompey; alleging al&s;o that the pre&s;ent troops of which Cae&s;ar's army was compo&s;ed, were but the &s;hadow of tho&s;e old legions that had fought in Britain and Gaul; that all the veterans were worn out, and had been replaced by new levies made in a hurry in Ci|&s;alpine Gaul. To increa&s;e the confidence of the army &s;till more, he took an oath, which the re&s;t of the officers followed him in, never to return to the camp but with victory. In this di&s;po&s;ition, and under the&s;e advanta|geous circum&s;tances, Pompey led his troops to battle.</P>
<P>Pompey's order of battle was good and well judged. In the centre, and on the two flanks, he placed all his veterans, and di&s;tributed his new-rai&s;ed troops between the wings and the main body. The Syrian legions were placed in the centre, under the command of Sci|pio; the Spaniards, on whom he greatly relied, were put on the right under Domitius Aenobarbus; and on the left were &s;tationed the two legions which Cae&s;ar had re&s;tored in the beginning of the war, led on by Pompey him&s;elf; becau&s;e from thence he intended to make the attack which was to gain the day; and, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, he had there a&s;&s;embled all his hor&s;e, &s;lingers, and archers, of which his right wing had no need, being co|vered by the river Enipius. Cae&s;ar likewi&s;e divided his army into three bodies, under three commanders; Do|mitius Calvinus being placed in the centre, and Mark Anthony on the left, while he him&s;elf led on the right wing, which was to oppo&s;e the left commanded by Pompey. It is remarkable enough that Pompey cho&s;e to put him&s;elf at the head of tho&s;e troops which were di&s;ciplined and in&s;tructed by Cae&s;ar; an inconte&s;tible proof how much he valued them above any of the re&s;t of his army. Cae&s;ar, on the contrary, placed him&s;elf at the head of his tenth legion, that had owed all its merit and fame to his own training. As he ob&s;erved the enemy's numerous cavalry to be all drawn to one &s;pot,
<PB N="148" REF="021451_0147_0FB3F6DE9CB68660">
he gue&s;&s;ed at Pompey's intention; to obviate which he made a draught of &s;ix cohorts from his rear line, and forming them into a &s;eparate body, concealed them be|hind his right wing, with in&s;tructions not to throw their javelins on the approach of Pompey's hor&s;e, as was cu&s;|tomary, but to keep them in their hands and pu&s;h them directly in the faces and the eyes of the hor&s;emen, who, being compo&s;ed of the younger part of the Roman nobi|lity, valued them&s;elves much upon their beauty, and dreaded a &s;car in the face more than a wound in the body. He la&s;tly placed the little cavalry he had, &s;o as to cover the right of the tenth legion, ordering his third line not to march till they had received the &s;ignal from him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As the armies approached, the two generals went from rank to rank, encouraging their men, warming their hopes, and le&s;&s;ening their apprehen&s;ions. Pompey repre&s;ented to his men, that the glorious occa&s;ion which they had long be&s;ought him to grant was now before them; "and indeed," cried he, "what advantages could you wi&s;h over an enemy, that you are not now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of? Your numbers, your vigor, a late victory, all a&s;&s;ure a &s;peedy and an ea&s;y conque&s;t of tho&s;e hara&s;&s;ed and broken troops, compo&s;ed of men worn out with age, and impre&s;&s;ed with the terrors of a recent defeat: but there is &s;till a &s;tronger bulwark for our protection than the &s;uperiority of our &s;trength&mdash;the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e. You are engaged in the defence of liberty and of your country; you are &s;upported by its laws, and followed by its magi&s;trates; you have the world &s;pectators of your conduct, and wi&s;hing you &s;ucce&s;s; on the contrary, he whom you oppo&s;e is a robber and oppre&s;&s;or of his country, and almo&s;t already &s;unk with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his crimes, as well as the bad &s;ucce&s;s of his arms. Show, then, on this occa&s;ion, all that ardor and dete&s;|tation of tyranny that &s;hould animate Romans, and do ju&s;tice to mankind." Cae&s;ar, on his &s;ide, went among his men with that &s;teady &s;erenity for which he was &s;o much admired in the mid&s;t of danger. He in&s;i&s;ted on nothing &s;o &s;trongly to his &s;oldiers as his frequent and un&s;ucce&s;sful endeavors for peace. He talked with ter|ror of the blood he was going to &s;hed, and pleaded
<PB N="149" REF="021451_0148_0FB3F6E097608710">
only the nece&s;&s;ity that urged him to it. He deplored the many brave men that were to fall on both &s;ides, and the wounds of his country whoever &s;hould be victorious. His &s;oldiers an&s;wered his &s;peech with looks of ardor and impatience; which ob&s;erving, he gave the &s;ignal to begin. The word on Pompey's &s;ide, was Hercules the invincible: that on Cae&s;ar's, Venus the victorious. There was only &s;o much &s;pace between both armies as to give room for fighting; wherefore Pompey ordered his men to receive the fir&s;t &s;hock without moving out of their places, expecting the enemy's ranks to be put into di&s;|order by their motion. Cae&s;ar's &s;oldiers were now ru&s;h|ing on with their u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity, when perceiving the enemy motionle&s;s, they all &s;topt &s;hort as if by general con&s;ent, and halted in the mid&s;t of their career. A ter|rible pau&s;e en&s;ued, in which both armies continued to gaze upon each other with mutual terror and dreadful &s;erenity; at length, Cae&s;ar's men, having taken breath, ran furiou&s;ly upon the enemy, fir&s;t di&s;charging their ja|velins, and then drawing their &s;words. The &s;ame me|thod was ob&s;erved by Pompey's troops, who as vigorou&s;|ly oppo&s;ed the attack. His cavalry al&s;o were ordered to charge at the very on&s;et, which, with the multitude of archers and &s;lingers, &s;oon obliged Cae&s;ar's men to give ground; whereupon Cae&s;ar immediately ordered the &s;ix cohorts that were placed as a reinforcement to advance, with orders to &s;trike at the enemy's faces. This had its de&s;ired effect. The cavalry, that were but ju&s;t now &s;ure of victory, received an immediate check: the un|u&s;ual method of fighting pur&s;ued by the cohorts, their aiming entirely at the vi&s;ages of the a&s;&s;ailants, and the horrible disfiguring wounds they made, all contributed to intimidate them &s;o much, that, in&s;tead of defending their per&s;ons, their only endeavor was to &s;ave their faces. A total rout en&s;ued of their whole body, which fled in great di&s;order to the neighboring mountains, while the archers and &s;lingers, who were thus abandon|ed, were cut to pieces. Cae&s;ar now commanded the co|horts to pur&s;ue their &s;ucce&s;s, and, advancing, charged Pompey's troops upon the flank. This charge the ene|my with&s;tood for &s;ome time with great bravery, till he brought up his third line, which had not yet engaged

Pompey's infantry being thus doubly attacked in front by fre&s;h troops, and in rear by the victorious cohorts. could no longer re&s;i&s;t, but fled to their camp. The flight began among the &s;trangers, though Pompey's right wing &s;till valiantly maintained their ground. Cae|&s;ar, however, being convinced that the victory was cer|tain, with his u&s;ual clemency cried out, to pur&s;ue the &s;trangers, but to &s;pare the Romans; upon which they all laid down their arms and received quarters. The greate&s;t &s;laughter was among the auxiliaries, who fled on all quarters, but principally went for &s;afety to the camp. The battle ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow la&s;ted from the break of day till noon, although the weather was extremely hot; the conquerors, however, did not remit their ardor, being encouraged by the example of their general, who thought his victory not complete till he became ma&s;ter of the ene|my's camp. Accordingly, marching on foot at their head, he called upon them to follow and &s;trike the de|ci&s;ive blow. The cohorts which were left to defend the camp, for &s;ome time made a formidable re&s;i&s;tance, par|ticularly a great number of Thracians and other barba|rians who were appointed for its defence: but nothing could re&s;i&s;t the ardor of Cae&s;ar's victorious army; they were at la&s;t driven from their trenches, and all fled to the mountains not far off. Cae&s;ar &s;eeing the field and camp &s;trewed with his fallen countrymen, was &s;trongly affected at &s;o melancholy a pro&s;pect, and could not help crying out to one that &s;tood near him, "They would have it &s;o." Upon entering the enemy's camp, every object pre&s;ented fre&s;h in&s;tances of the blind pre&s;umption and madne&s;s of his adver&s;aries. On all &s;ides were to be &s;een tents adorned with ivy, and branches of myrtle, couches covered with purple, and &s;ideboards loaded with plate. Every thing gave proofs of the highe&s;t luxury, and &s;eemed rather the preparatives for a banquet, the rejoicings for a victory, than the di&s;po&s;itions for a battle. A camp &s;o richly furni&s;hed might have been able to en|gage the attention of any troops but Cae&s;ar's; there was &s;till &s;omething to be done, and he would not permit them to pur&s;ue any other object than their enemies, till they were entirely &s;ubdued. A con&s;iderable body of them having retired to the adjacent mountains, he prevailed
<PB N="151" REF="021451_0150_0FB3F6E31D18D658">
on his &s;oldiers to join him in the pur&s;uit, in order to oblige the&s;e to &s;urrender. He began by inclo&s;ing them with a line drawn at the foot of the mountain; but they quickly abandoned a po&s;t which was not tenable for want of water, and endeavored to reach the city of Lari&s;&s;a. Cae&s;ar led a party of his army by a &s;horter way, and intercepted their retreat, drawing up in order of battle between them and the city. However, the&s;e unhappy fugitives once more found protection from a mountain, at the foot of which a rivulet ran, which &s;up|plied them with water. Now night approaching, Cae|&s;ar's men were almo&s;t &s;pent, and ready to faint with their ince&s;&s;ant toil &s;ince morning; yet &s;till he prevailed upon them once more to renew their labors, and to cut off the rivulet that &s;upplied the defendents. The fu|gitives, thus deprived of all hopes of &s;uccor or &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, &s;ent deputies to the conqueror, offering to &s;ur|render at di&s;cretion. During the interval of negocia|tion, a few &s;enators that were among them took the advantage of the night to e&s;cape, and the re&s;t next morn|ing gave up their arms, and experienced the conqueror's clemency. In fact, he addre&s;&s;ed them with great gentle|ne&s;s, and forbade his &s;oldiers to offer them any violence, or take any thing from them. Thus Cae&s;ar, by his con|duct, gained the mo&s;t complete victory that had ever been obtained; and, by his great clemency after the battle, &s;eemed to have de&s;erved it. His lo&s;s amounted to but two hundered men; that of Pompey to fifteen thou&s;and, as well Romans as auxiliaries: twenty-four thou&s;and men &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war, the greate&s;t part of whom entered into Cae&s;ar's a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y, and were incorporated with the re&s;t of his forces. As to the &s;enators and Roman knights who fell into his hands, he generou&s;ly gave liberty to retire where|ever they thought proper; and as for the letters which Pompey had received from &s;everal per&s;ons who wi&s;hed to be thought neutral, he burnt them all without read|ing them as Pompey had done upon a former occa&s;ion. Thus, having performed all the duties of a general and a &s;tate&s;man, he &s;ent for the legions which had pa&s;&s;ed the night in the camp, to relieve tho&s;e which had accompa|nied

him in the pur&s;uit, and arrived the &s;ame day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lari&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>As for Pompey, who had formerly &s;hown &s;uch in|&s;tances of courage and conduct, when he &s;aw his cavalry routed, on which he had placed his &s;ole dependance, he ab&s;olutely lo&s;t his rea&s;on. In&s;tead of thinking how to re|medy this di&s;order, by rallying &s;uch troops as fled, or by oppo&s;ing fre&s;h troops to &s;top the progre&s;s of the con|querors, being totally amazed by this unexpected blow, he returned to the camp, and, in his tent, waited the i&s;&s;ue of an event, which it was his duty to direct, not to follow. There he remained for &s;ome moments without &s;peaking; till, being told that the camp was attacked, "What," &s;ays he, "are we pur&s;ued to our very entrenchments?" and immediately quitting his armor for a habit more &s;uitable to his circum&s;tances, he fled on hor&s;eback to Lari&s;&s;a; from whence, perceiving he was not pur|&s;ued, he &s;lackened his pace, giving way to all the ago|nizing reflections which his deplorable &s;ituation mu&s;t naturally &s;ugge&s;t. In this melancholy manner he pa&s;&s;ed along the vale of Tempe, and, pur&s;uing the cour&s;e of the river Peneus, at la&s;t arrived at a fi&s;herman's hut, in which he pa&s;&s;ed the night. From thence he went on board a little bark, and, keeping along the &s;ea-&s;hore, he de&s;cried a &s;hip of &s;ome burden, which &s;eemed preparing to &s;ail, in which he embarked, the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el &s;till pay|ing him the homage which was due to his former &s;ta|tion. From the mouth of the river Peneus he &s;ailed to Amphipolis; where, finding his affairs de&s;perate, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ered to Le&s;bos to take in his wife Cornelia, whom he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> left there at a di&s;tance from the dangers and hurry of the war. She, who had long flattered her&s;elf with the hopes of victory, felt the rever&s;e of her fortune in an agony of di&s;tre&s;s. She was de&s;ired by the me&s;&s;enger (who&s;e tears more than words proclaimed the great|ne&s;s of her misfortunes) to ha&s;ten if &s;he expected to &s;ee Pompey, with but one &s;hip, and even that not his own. Her grief, which before was violent, be|came then in&s;upportable; &s;he fainted away, and lay a con&s;iderable time without any &s;igns of life. At length recovering her&s;elf, and reflecting it was now no time for vain lamentations, &s;he ran quite through the city to

the &s;ea-&s;ide. Pompey embraced her without &s;peaking a word, and for &s;ome time &s;upported her in his arms in &s;ilent de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Having taken in Cornelia, he now continued his cour&s;e, &s;teering to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and &s;topping no longer than was nece&s;&s;ary to take in provi&s;ions at the ports that occurred in his pa&s;&s;age. He was at la&s;t prevailed upon to apply to Ptolemy king of Egypt, to who&s;e father Pompey had been a con&s;iderable benefactor. Ptolemy, who was as yet a minor, had not the government in his own hands, but he and his kingdom were under the di|rection of Photinus an eunuch, and Theodotus a ma&s;ter of the art of &s;peaking. The&s;e advi&s;ed that Pompey &s;hould be invited on &s;hore, and there &s;lain; and, accord|ingly, Achillas, the commander of the forces, and Sep|timius, by birth a Roman, and who had formerly been a centurion in Pompey's army, were appointed to carry their opinion into execution. Being attended by three or four more, they went into a little bark, and rowed off from land towards Pompey's &s;hip that lay about a mile from the &s;hore. Pompey, after taking leave of Cornelia, who wept at his departure, and having repeat|ed two ver&s;es of Sophocles, &s;ignifying, that he who tru&s;ts his freedom to a tyrant from that moment be|comes a &s;lave, gave his hand to Achillas, and &s;tept into the bark, with only two attendants of his own. They had now rowed from the &s;hip a good way, and, as during that time they all kept a profound &s;ilence, Pompey, willing to begin the di&s;cour&s;e, acco&s;ted Septimius, who&s;e face he recollected. "Methinks, friend," cried he, "you and I were once fellow-&s;oldiers together." Sep|timius gave only a nod with his head, without uttering a word, or in&s;tancing the lea&s;t civility. Pompey, there|fore, took out a paper, on which he had minuted a &s;peech he intended to make to the king, and began reading it. In this manner they approached the &s;hore; and Cornelia, who&s;e concern had never &s;uffered her to lo&s;e &s;ight of her hu&s;band, began to conceive hope, when &s;he perceived the people on the &s;trand crowding down along the coa&s;ts, as if willing to receive him: but her hopes were &s;oon de&s;troyed; for that in&s;tant, as Pompey ro&s;e, &s;upporting him&s;elf upon his freed-man's arm,
<PB N="154" REF="021451_0153_0FB3F6E7A3885810">
Septimius &s;tabbed him in the back, and was in&s;tantly &s;econded by Achillas. Pompey, perceiving his death inevitable, only di&s;po&s;ed him&s;elf to meet it with decen|cy; and, covering his face with his robe, without &s;peak|ing a word, with a &s;igh re&s;igned him&s;elf to his fate. At this horrid &s;ight, Cornelia &s;hrieked &s;o loud as to be heard to the &s;hore; but the danger &s;he her&s;elf was in did not allow the mariners time to look on: they imme|diately &s;et &s;ail, and, the wind proving favorable, fortu|nately they e&s;caped the pur&s;uit of the Egyptian gallies. In the mean time, Pompey's murderers having cut off his head, cau&s;ed it to be embalmed, the better to pre|&s;erve its features, de&s;igning it for a pre&s;ent to Cae&s;ar. The body was thrown naked on the &s;trand, and expo|&s;ed to the view of all tho&s;e who&s;e curio&s;ity led them that way. However, his faithful freed-man Philip &s;till kept near it; and when the crowd was di&s;per&s;ed, he wa&s;hed it in the &s;ea: and looking round for materials to burn it with, he preceived the wreck of a fi&s;hing-boat; of which he compo&s;ed a pile. While he was thus piou&s;ly em|ployed, he was acco&s;ted by an old Roman &s;oldier who had &s;erved under Pompey in his youth.

<HEAD>IX. ON the PLEASURE ARISING from OBJECTS of SIGHT.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE plea&s;ures of the imagination which ari&s;e from the actual view and &s;urvey of outward objects, all pro|ceed from the &s;ight of what is great, uncommon or beau|tiful.</P>
<P>By greatne&s;s, I do not only mean the bulk of any &s;in|gle object, but the largene&s;s of a whole view con&s;idered as one entire piece. Such are the pro&s;pects of an open champaign country, a va&s;t uncultivated de&s;ert, of huge heaps of mountains, high rocks and precipices, or a wide expan&s;e of waters, where we are not &s;truck with the novelty, or beauty of the &s;ight, but with that rude kind of magnificence which appears in many of the&s;e &s;tupen|duous works of nature. Our imagination loves to be filled with an object, or to gra&s;p at any thing that is too big for its capacity. We are flung into a plea&s;ing a&s;to|ni&s;hment at &s;uch unbounded views, and feel a delightful &s;tillne&s;s and amazement in the &s;oul at the apprehen&s;ions of them. The mind of man naturally hates every thing that looks like a re&s;traint upon it, and is apt to fancy it|&s;elf under a &s;ort of confinement, when the &s;ight is pent up in a narrow compa&s;s, and &s;hortened on every &s;ide by the neighbourhood of walls or mountains. On the con|trary, a &s;pacious horizon is an image of liberty, where the eye has room to range abroad, to expatiate at large on the immen&s;ity of its views, and to lo&s;e it&s;elf amid&s;t the variety of objects that offer them&s;elves to its ob|&s;ervation. Such wide and undetermined pro&s;pects are as plea&s;ing to the fancy as the &s;peculations of eternity or infinitude are to the under&s;tanding. But if there be a beauty or uncommonne&s;s joined with this grandeur, as in a troubled ocean, a heaven adorned with &s;tars and meteors, or a &s;pacious land&s;cape cut out into rivers, woods, rocks, and meadows, the plea&s;ure &s;till grows up|on us, as it ri&s;es from more than a &s;ingle principle.</P>
<P>Every thing that is new or uncommon rai&s;es a plea&s;ure in the imagination, becau&s;e it fills the &s;oul with an a|greeable
<PB N="158" REF="021451_0157_0FB3F6ED9D859A18">
&s;urpri&s;e, gratifies its curio&s;ity, and gives it an idea of which it was not before po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. We are in|deed &s;o often conver&s;ant with one &s;et of objects, and tired out with &s;o many repeated &s;hows of the &s;ame things, that whatever is new and uncommon, contributes a little to vary human life, and to divert our minds for a while with the &s;trangene&s;s of its appearance; it &s;erves us for a kind of refre&s;hment, and takes off from that &s;atiety we are apt to complain of in our u&s;ual and ordinary enter|tainments. It is this that be&s;tows charms on a mon&s;ter, and makes even the imperfections of nature plea&s;e us. It is this that recommends variety, where the mind is every in&s;tant called off to &s;omething new, and the at|tention not &s;uffered to dwell too long, and wa&s;te it&s;elf on any particular object: it is this likewi&s;e, that improves what is great or beautiful, and makes it afford the mind a double entertainment. Groves, fields, and meadows, are at any &s;ea&s;on of the year plea&s;ant to look upon; but never &s;o much as in the opening of the &s;pring, when they are all new and fre&s;h, with their fir&s;t glo&s;s upon them, and not yet too much accu&s;tomed and familiar to the eye. For this rea&s;on there is nothing that more enlivens a pro&s;pect than rivers, jetteaus, or falls of wa|ter where the &s;cene is perpetually &s;hifting, and enter|taining the &s;ight every moment with &s;omething that is new. We are quickly tired with looking upon hills and valleys, where every thing continues fixt and &s;et|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in the &s;ame place and po&s;ture, but find our thoughts a little agitated and relieved at the &s;ight of &s;uch objects as are ever in motion, and &s;liding away from beneath the eye of the beholder.</P>
<P>But there is nothing that makes its way more directly to the &s;oul than beauty, which immediately diffu&s;es a &s;ecret &s;atisfaction and complacency through the imagi|nation, and gives a fini&s;hing to any thing that is great or uncommon. The very fir&s;t di&s;covery of it &s;trikes the mind with an inward joy, and &s;preads a cheerfulne&s;s and delight through all its faculties. There is not perhaps any real beauty or deformity more in one piece of mat|ter than another; becau&s;e we might have been &s;o made, that what&s;oever now appears loath&s;ome to us might have &s;hown it&s;elf agreeable; but we find by experience, that
<PB N="159" REF="021451_0158_0FB3F6EF1F3B9B00">
there are &s;everal modifications of matter, which the mind without any previous con&s;ideration, pronounces at the fir&s;t &s;ight beautiful or deformed. Thus we &s;ee that every different &s;pecies of &s;en&s;ible creatures has its different notions of beauty, and that each of them is mo&s;t affected with the beauties of its own kind. This is no where more remarkable than in birds of the &s;ame &s;hape and proportion, where we often &s;ee the male deter|mined in his court&s;hip by the &s;ingle grain or tincture of a feather, and never di&s;covering any charms but in the color of its &s;pecies.</P>
<P>There is a &s;econd kind of beauty that we find in the &s;everal products of art and nature, which does not work in the imagination with that w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and violence as the beauty that appears in our proper &s;pecies, but is apt however, to rai&s;e in us a &s;ecret delight, and a kind of fondne&s;s for the places or objects in which we di&s;cover it. This con&s;i&s;ts either in the gaiety or variety of co|lors, in the &s;ymmetry and proportion of parts, in the arrangement and di&s;po&s;ition of bodies, or in a ju&s;t mix|ture and concurrence of all together. Among the&s;e &s;everal kinds of beauty the eye takes mo&s;t delight in co|lors. We no where meet with a more glorious or plea|&s;ing &s;how in nature, than what appears in the heavens at the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the &s;un, which is wholly made up of tho&s;e different &s;tains of light that &s;how them|&s;elves in clouds of a different &s;ituation. For this rea&s;on we find the poets, who are always addre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to the imagination, borrowing more of their epithets from colors than from any other topic.</P>
<P>As the fancy delights in every thing that is great, &s;trange or beautiful, and is &s;till more plea&s;ed the more it finds of the&s;e perfections in the &s;ame object; &s;o it is capable of receiving a new &s;atisfaction by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of another &s;en&s;e. Thus any continued &s;ound, as the mu&s;ic of birds, or the fall of water, awakens every mo|ment the mind of the beholder, and makes him more at|tentive to the &s;everal beauties of the place that lie be|fore him. Thus if there ari&s;es a fragrancy of &s;mells or perfumes, they heighten the plea&s;ures of the imagina|tion, and make even the colors and verdure of the land&s;cape appear more agreeable: for the ideas of both
<PB N="160" REF="021451_0159_0FB3F6F09DECC058">
&s;en&s;es recommend each other, and are plea&s;anter toge|ther than when they enter the mind &s;eparately; as the different colors of a picture, when they are well di&s;po|&s;ed, &s;et off one another, and receive an additional beau|ty from the advantage of their &s;ituation.</P>

<P>I beheld his body half wa&s;ted away with long expec|tation and confinement; and felt what kind of &s;ickne&s;s of the heart it is which ari&s;es from hope deferred.

<P>He was &s;itting upon the ground, upon a little &s;traw in the farthe&s;t corner of his dungeon, which was alter|nately his chair and bed. A little calender of &s;mall &s;ticks was laid at the head, notched all over with the di&s;mal days and nights he had pa&s;&s;ed there. He had one of the&s;e little &s;ticks in his hand; and, with a ru&s;ty nail, he was etching another day of mi&s;ery, to add to the heap.

<P>He was one evening &s;itting thus at his &s;upper, when the landlord of a little inn in the village came into the

<P>I de&s;paired at fir&s;t, &s;aid the Corporal, of being able to bring back your honor any kind of intelligence con|cerning the poor &s;ick Lieutenant&mdash;Is he in the army, then? &s;aid my uncle Toby&mdash;He is, &s;aid the corporal&mdash; and in what regiment &s;aid my uncle Toby&mdash;I'll tell your honor, replied the Corporal, every thing &s;traight forward, as I learnt it.&mdash;Then, Trim, I'll fill another pipe, &s;aid my uncle Toby, and not interrupt thee; &s;o &s;it down at thy ea&s;e, Trim, in the window &s;eat, and begin thy &s;tory again. The Corporal made his old bow, which gene|rally &s;poke as plain as a bow could &s;peak it, "Your ho|nor is good:"&mdash;And having done that, he &s;at down, as he was ordered,&mdash;and began the &s;tory to my uncle To|by over again in pretty near the &s;ame words.</P>

<P>I was hearing this account continued the Corporal, when the youth came into the kitchen, to order the thin toa&s;t the landlord &s;poke of;&mdash;but I will do it for my father my&s;elf &s;aid the youth.&mdash;Pray let me &s;ave you the trouble, young gentleman, &s;aid I, taking up a fork for the purpo&s;e, and offering him my chair to &s;it down upon by the fire, whil&s;t I did it.&mdash;I believe, Sir, &s;aid he, very mode&s;tly, I can plea&s;e him be&s;t my&s;elf.&mdash;I am &s;ure, &s;aid I, his honor will not like the toa&s;t the wor&s;e for being toa&s;ted by an old &s;oldier.&mdash;The youth took hold of my hand, and in&s;tantly bur&s;t into tears. Poor youth! &s;aid my uncle Toby,&mdash;he has been bred up from an infant in the army, and the name of a &s;oldier, Trim, &s;ounded in his ears like the name of a friend; I wi&s;h I had him here.</P>

<P>When I gave him the toa&s;t, continued the Corporal, I thought it was proper to tell him I was Captain Shan|dy's &s;ervant, and that your honor (though a &s;tranger) was extremely concerned for his father; and that if there was any thing in your hou&s;e or cellar&mdash;(and thou might'&s;t have added my pur&s;e too, &s;aid my uncle Toby), &mdash;he was heartily welcome to it:&mdash;He made a very low bow (which was meant to your honor), but no an|&s;wer&mdash;for his heart was full&mdash;&s;o he went up &s;tairs with

<P>I thought, &s;aid the curate, that you gentlemen of the army, Mr. Trim, never &s;aid your prayers at all.&mdash;I heard the poor gentleman &s;ay his prayers la&s;t night, &s;aid the landlady, very devoutly, and with my own ears, or I could not have believed it.&mdash;Are you &s;ure of it, re|plied the curate.&mdash;A &s;oldier, an' plea&s;e your reverence, &s;aid I, prays as often (of his own accord) as a par&s;on;&mdash; and when he is fighting for his king, and for his own life, and for his honor too, he has the mo&s;t rea&s;on to pray to God of any one in the whole world.&mdash;'Twas well &s;aid of thee, Trim &s;aid my uncle Toby.&mdash;But when a &s;oldier, &s;aid I, an' plea&s;e your reverence, has been &s;tand|ing for twelve hours together, in the trenches, up to his knees in cold water,&mdash;or engaged, &s;aid I, for months together in long and dangerous marches; hara&s;&s;ed, per|haps, in his rear to-day; hara&s;&s;ing others to-morrow; &mdash;detached here;&mdash;countermanded there;&mdash;re&s;ting this night out upon his arms?&mdash;beat up in his &s;hirt the next: &mdash;benumbed in his joints;&mdash;perhaps without &s;traw in his tent to kneel on;&mdash;he mu&s;t &s;ay his prayers how and when he can&mdash;I believe, &s;aid I,&mdash;for I was piqued, quoth the corporal, for the reputation of the army&mdash;I believe, an' plea&s;e your reverence, &s;aid I, that when a &s;oldier gets time to pray,&mdash;he prays as heartily as a par|&s;on,&mdash;though not with all his fu&s;s and hypocri&s;y.&mdash; Thou &s;hould&s;t not have &s;aid that, Trim, &s;aid my uncle Toby,&mdash;for God only knows who is a hypocrite, and who is not:&mdash;At the great and general review of us all,

what he could do to help him?&mdash;and without giving him time to an&s;wer any one of the inquiries, went on and told him of the little plan which he had been con|certing with the Corporal the night before for him&mdash;</P>

<P>All that is nece&s;&s;ary to be added is as follow &mdash;</P>

<P>My uncle Toby took down the &s;word from the crook where it had hung untouched ever &s;ince the Lieutenant's death, and delivered it to the Corporal to brighten up; &mdash;and having detained Le Fever a &s;ingle fortnight to equip him, and contract for his pa&s;&s;age to Leghorn,&mdash; he put the &s;word into his hand,&mdash;If thou art brave, Le Fever, &s;aid my uncle Toby, this will not fail thee;&mdash; but Fortune, &s;aid he (mu&s;ing a little)&mdash;Fortune may&mdash; And if &s;he does,&mdash;added my uncle Toby embracing him, come back again to me, Le Fever, and we will &s;hape thee another cour&s;e.</P>

<L>She, with her widow'd mother, feeble, old,</L>

<HEAD>I. On TRUTH and INTEGRITY.</HEAD>
<P>TRUTH and integrity have all the advantages of appearance, and many more. If the &s;how of any thing be good for any thing, I am &s;ure the reality is better; for why does any man di&s;&s;emble, or &s;eem to be that which he is not, but becau&s;e he thinks it good to have the qualities he pretends to? for to counterfeit and di&s;&s;emble, is to put on the appearance of &s;ome real excellency. Now, the be&s;t way for a man to &s;eem to be any thing, is really to be what he would &s;eem to be. Be&s;ides, it is often as trouble&s;ome to &s;upport the pre|tence of a good quality, as to have it; and if a man have it not, it is mo&s;t likely he will be di&s;covered to want it; and then all his labor to &s;eem to have it is lo&s;t. There is &s;omething unnatural in painting, which a &s;kil|ful eye will ea&s;ily di&s;cern from native beauty and com|plexion.</P>
<P>It is hard to per&s;onate and act a part long; for, where truth is not at the bottom, nature will always be endea|voring to return, and will betray her&s;elf at one time or other. Therefore, if any man think it convenient to &s;eem good, let him be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o indeed: and then his goodne&s;s will appear to every o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e's &s;atisfaction: for truth is con|vincing, and carries is own light and evidence along with it; and will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nly commend us to every man's

con&s;cience, but, which is much more, to God, who &s;earcheth our hearts. So that, upon all accounts, &s;in|cerity is true wi&s;dom. Particularly, as to the affairs of this world, integrity hath many advantages over all the artificial modes of di&s;&s;imulation and deceit. It is much the plainer and ea&s;ier, much the &s;afer and more &s;ecure way of dealing in the world; it hath le&s;s of trouble and difficulty, of entanglement and perplexity, of danger and hazard, in it; it is the &s;horte&s;t and neare&s;t way to our end, carrying us thither in a &s;traight line; and will hold out and la&s;t longe&s;t. The arts of deceit and cun|ning continually grow weaker and le&s;s effectual and &s;er|viceable to tho&s;e that practi&s;e them: whereas integrity gains &s;trength by u&s;e; and the more and longer any man practi&s;eth it, the greater &s;ervice it does him, by confirming his reputation, and encouraging tho&s;e with whom he hath to do, to repo&s;e the greate&s;t confidence in him; which is an un&s;peakable advantage in bu&s;ine&s;s and the affairs of life.</P>
<P>A di&s;&s;embler mu&s;t always be upon his guard, and watch him&s;elf carefully, that he do not contradict his own preten&s;ions; for he acts an unnatural part, and therefore mu&s;t put a continual force and re&s;traint upon him&s;elf: whereas he that acts &s;incerely, hath the ea&s;ie&s;t ta&s;k in the world; becau&s;e he follows nature, and &s;o is put to no trouble and care about his words and actions; he needs not invent any pretences before hand, nor make excu&s;es afterwards, for any thing he hath &s;aid or done.</P>
<P>But in &s;incerity is very trouble&s;ome to manage. A hypocrite hath &s;o many things to attend to, as make his life a very perplexed and intricate thing. A liar hath need of a good memory, le&s;t he contradict at one time what he &s;aid at another. But truth is always con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and needs nothing to help it out; it is al|ways near at hand, and &s;its upon our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are aware; whereas a lie is trou|ble&s;ome, and one trick needs a great many more to make it good.</P>
<P>Add to all this, that &s;incerity i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mo&s;t compendi|ous wi&s;dom, and an excellent in&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ument for the &s;peedy di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s.

and brings things to an i&s;&s;ue in a few words. It is like travelling in a plain beaten road, which commonly brings a man &s;ooner to his journey's end than by-ways, in which men often lo&s;e them&s;elves. In a word, whatever convenience may be thought to be in fal&s;ehood and di&s;|&s;imulation, it is &s;oon over; but the inconvenience of it is perpetual, becau&s;e it brings a man under an everla&s;t|ing jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion, &s;o that he is not believed when he &s;peaks truth, nor tru&s;ted when perhaps he means hone&s;tly. When a man hath once forfeited the reputa|tion of his integrity, nothing will then &s;erve his turn, neither truth nor fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>Indeed, if a man were only to deal in the world for a day, and &s;hould never have occa&s;ion to conver&s;e more with mankind, never more need their good opinion or good word, it were then no great matter (as far as re|&s;pects the affairs of this world) if he &s;pent his reputa|tion all at once, and ventured it at one throw. But, if he be to continue in the world, and would have the ad|vantage of reputation whil&s;t he is in it, let him make u&s;e of &s;incerity in all his words and actions, for nothing but this will hold out to the end. All other arts will fail; but truth and integrity will carry a man through, and bear him out to the la&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>II. ON DOING AS WE WOULD BE DONE UNTO.</HEAD>
<P>HUMAN laws are often &s;o numerous as to e&s;cape our memories; &s;o darkly &s;ometimes, and incon&s;i&s;tently worded, as to puzzle our under&s;tandings; and their ori|ginal ob&s;curity is not &s;eldom improved by the nice di|&s;tinctions and &s;ubtle rea&s;onings of tho&s;e who profe&s;s to clear them: &s;o that, under the&s;e &s;everal di&s;advantages, they lo&s;e much of their force and influence; and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, rai&s;e more di&s;putes than, perhaps, they de|termine. But here is a law, attended with none of the&s;e inconveniences; the gro&s;&s;e&s;t minds can &s;carce mi&s;appre|hend it; the weake&s;t memories are capable of retaining it; no perplexing comment can ea&s;ily cloud it; the au|thority of no man's glo&s;s upon earth can (if we are but &s;incere) &s;way us to make a wrong con&s;truction of it. What is &s;aid of all the go&s;pel precepts by the evange|lical prophet, is more eminently true of this: "It is an
<PB N="246" REF="021451_0245_0FB5CF85ABDB8DE8">
high-way; and the wayfareing man, though a fool, &s;hall not err therein."</P>
<P>It is not enough that a rule, which is to be of gene|ral u&s;e, is &s;uited to all capacities, &s;o that, where-ever it is repre&s;ented to the mind, it is pre&s;ently agreed to; it mu&s;t al&s;o be apt to offer it&s;elf to our thoughts, and lie ready for pre&s;ent u&s;e, upon all exigencies and occa&s;ions. And &s;uch, remarkably &s;uch, is that which our Lord here recommends to us, we can &s;carce be &s;o far &s;urpri&s;ed by any immediate nece&s;&s;ity of acting, as not to have time for a &s;hort recour&s;e to it, room for a &s;uddden glance as it were upon it, in our minds; where it re&s;ts and &s;parkles always, like the Urim and Thummim on the brea&s;t of Aaron. There is no occa&s;ion for us to go in &s;earch of it to the oracles of law, dead or living: to the code or pandects: to the volumes of divines or morali&s;ts: We need look no further than our&s;elves for it: for (to u&s;e the appo&s;ite expre&s;&s;ions of Mo&s;es), "This command|ment which I command thee this day, is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It is not in heaven, that thou &s;hould&s;t &s;ay, Who &s;hall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? Nei|their is it beyond the &s;ea, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t thou &s;hould&s;t &s;ay, Who &s;hall go over the &s;ea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? But the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou maye&s;t do it."</P>
<P>It is, moreover, a precept particularly fitted for prac|tice; as it involves in the very notion of it a motive &s;tir|ring us up to do what it enjoins. Other moral maxims propo&s;e naked truths to the under&s;tanding, which ope|rate often but faintly and &s;lowly on the will and pa&s;|&s;ions, the two active principles of the mind of man: but it is the peculiar character of this, that it addre&s;&s;eth it|&s;elf equally to all the&s;e powers; imparts both light and heat to us; and at the &s;ame time that it informs us cer|tainly and clearly what we are to do, excites us al&s;o, in the mo&s;t tender and moving manner to the performance of it. We can &s;ee our neighbor's misfortune, without a &s;en&s;ible degree of concern; which yet we cannot forbear expre&s;&s;ing, when we have once made his condition our own, and determined the mea&s;ure of our obligation to|wards

him, by what we our&s;elves &s;hould, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, expect from him: our duty grows immediately our in|tere&s;t and plea&s;ure, by means of this powerful prin|ciple; the &s;eat of which is, in truth, not more in the brain, than in the heart of man: it appeals to our very &s;en&s;es; and exerts its &s;ecret force in &s;o prevailing a way, that it is even felt, as well as under&s;tood by us.</P>
<P>The la&s;t recommendation of this rule I &s;hall mention, is its va&s;t and comprehen&s;ive influence: for it extends to all ranks and conditions of men, and to all kinds of ac|tion and intercour&s;e between them; to matters of cha|rity, genero&s;ity, and civility, as well as ju&s;tice; to nega|tive no le&s;s than po&s;itive duties. The ruler and the ru|led are alike &s;ubject to it; public communities can no more exempt them&s;elves from its obligation than private per&s;ons: "All per&s;ons mu&s;t fall down before it, all na|tions mu&s;t do it &s;ervice." And, with re&s;pect to this ex|tent of it, it is, that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord pronounces it in the text to be "the law and the prophets." His mean|ing is, that whatever rules of the &s;econd table are deli|vered in the law of Mo&s;es, or in the larger comments and explanations of that law made by the other writers of the Old Te&s;tament (here and el&s;ewhere &s;tyled the prophets), they are all virtually compri&s;ed in this one &s;hort &s;ignificant &s;aying, "What&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, do ye even &s;o unto them."</P>

<HEAD>III. ON BENEVOLENCE AND CHARITY.</HEAD>
<P>FORM as amiable &s;entiments as you can, of nations, communities of men, and individuals. If they are true, you do them only ju&s;tice; if fal&s;e, though your opinion does not alter their nature and make them love|ly, you your&s;elf are more lovely for entertaining &s;uch &s;entiments. When you feel the bright warmth of a tem|per thoroughly good in your own brea&s;t, you will &s;ee &s;omething good in every one about you. It is a mark of littlene&s;s of &s;pirit to confine your&s;elf to &s;ome minute part of a man's character: a man of generous, open, ex|tended views, will gra&s;p the whole of it; without which he cannot pa&s;s a right judgment on any part. He will not arraign a man's general conduct for two or three particular actions; as knowing that man is a change|able

creature, and will not cea&s;e to be &s;o, till he is uni|ted to that Being who is "the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day and for ever." He &s;trives to out do his friends in good offices, and overcome his enemies by them. He thinks he then receives the greate&s;t injury when he returns and revenges one: for then he is "overcome of evil." Is the per&s;on young who has injured him? He will reflect, that inexperience of the world, and a warmth of con&s;ti|tution, may betray his unpracti&s;ed years into &s;everal in|advertencies, which a more advanced age, his own good &s;en&s;e, and the advice of a judicious friend, will correct and rectify. Is he old? The infirmities of age and want of health may have &s;et an edge upon his &s;pirits, and made him "&s;peak unadvi&s;edly with his lips." Is he weak and ignorant? He con&s;iders that it is a duty in|cumbent upon the wi&s;e to bear with tho&s;e that are not &s;o. "Ye &s;uffer fools gladly," &s;ays St Paul, "&s;eeing ye your&s;elves are wi&s;e." In &s;hort, he judges of him&s;elf, as far as he can, with the &s;trict rigor of ju&s;tice; but of others, with the &s;oftenings of humanity,</P>
<P>From charitable and benevolent thoughts, the tran&s;i|tion is unavoidable to charitable actions. For wherever there is an inexhau&s;tible fund of goodne&s;s at the heart, it will, under all the di&s;advantages of circum&s;tances, exert it&s;elf in acts of &s;ub&s;tantial kindne&s;s. He that is &s;ub&s;tan|tially good, will be doing good. The man that has a hearty determinate will to be charitable, will &s;eldom put men off with the mere will for the deed. For a &s;incere de&s;ire to do good, implies &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s till the thing be done: and unea&s;ine&s;s &s;ets the mind at work, and puts it upon the &s;tretch to find out a thou&s;and ways and means of obliging, which will ever e&s;cape the uncon|cerned, the indifferent, and the unfeeling.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t proper objects of your bounty are the nece&s;|&s;itious. Give the &s;ame &s;um of money, which you be&s;tow on a per&s;on in tolerable circum&s;tances, to one in extreme poverty; and ob&s;erve what a wide di&s;proportion of hap|pine&s;s is produced. In the latter ca&s;e, it is like giving a cordial to a fainting per&s;on; in the former, it is like giving wine to him who has already quenched his thir&s;t.
<Q>Mercy is &s;ea&s;onable in time of affliction, like clouds of rain in the time of drought.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="021451_0248_0FB5CF92A860B738">And among the variety of nece&s;&s;itous objects, none have a better title to our compa&s;&s;ion, than tho&s;e, who, after having ta&s;ted the &s;weets of plenty, are, by &s;ome unde&s;erved calamity, obliged, without &s;ome charitable relief, to drag out the remainder of life in mi&s;ery and wo; who little thought they &s;hould a&s;k their daily bread of any but of God: who, after a life led in affluence, "cannot dig, and are a&s;hamed to beg." And they are to be relieved in &s;uch an endearing manner, with &s;uch a beauty of holine&s;s, that, at the &s;ame time that their wants are &s;upplied, their confu&s;ion of face may be pre|vented.</P>
<P>There is not an in&s;tance of this kind in hi&s;tory &s;o af|fecting, as that beautiful one of Boaz to Ruth. He knew her family, and how &s;he was reduced to the lowe&s;t ebb; when therefore &s;he begged leave to glean in his fields, he ordered his reapers to let fall &s;everal handfuls with a &s;eeming carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, but really with a &s;et de&s;ign, that &s;he might gather them up without being a&s;hamed. Thus did he form an artful &s;cheme, that he might give, without the vanity and o&s;tentation of giving; and &s;he receive, without the &s;hame and confu&s;ion of making ac|knowledgments. Take the hi&s;tory in the words of &s;crip|ture, as it is recorded in the book of Ruth. "And when &s;he was ri&s;en up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, &s;aying, Let her glean even among the &s;heaves, and rebuke her not: and let fall al&s;o &s;ome of the handfuls of purpo&s;e, and leave them that &s;he may glean them, and reproach her not." This was not only doing a good action; it was doing it likewi&s;e with a good grace.</P>
<P>It is not enough we do no harm, that we be negative|ly good; we mu&s;t do good, po&s;itive good, if we would "enter into life." When it would have been as good for the world, if &s;uch a man had never lived; it would perhaps have been better for him, "if he had never beer born." A &s;canty fortune may limit your beneficence, and confine it chiefly to the circle of your dome&s;tics, re|lations and neighbors; but let your benevolence ex|tend as far as thought can travel, to the utmo&s;t bounds of the world: ju&s;t as it may be only in your power to beautify the &s;pot of ground that lies near and clo&s;e to

<P>THE great pur&s;uit of man is after happine&s;s: it is the fir&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t de&s;ire of his nature;&mdash;in every &s;tage of his life he &s;earches for it as for hid trea|&s;ure;&mdash;courts it under a thou&s;and different &s;hapes;&mdash; and, though perpetually di&s;appointed,&mdash;&s;till per&s;i&s;ts&mdash; runs after and enquires for it afre&s;h&mdash;a&s;ks every pa&s;&s;en|ger who comes in his way, "Who will &s;how him any good?"&mdash;who will a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the attainment of it, or direct him to the di&s;covery of this great end of all his wi&s;hes?</P>
<P>He is told by one, to &s;earch for it among the more gay and youthful plea&s;ures of life; in &s;cenes of mirth and &s;prightline&s;s, where happine&s;s ever pre&s;ides, and is ever to be known by the joy and laughter which he will &s;ee at once painted in her looks.</P>
<P>A &s;econd, with a graver a&s;pect, points out to him the co&s;tly dwellings which pride and extravagance have erected:&mdash;tells the enquirer that the object he is in &s;earch of inhabits there;&mdash;that happine&s;s lives only in company with the great, in the mid&s;t of much pomp and outward &s;tate.

Scarce a reformed &s;en&s;uali&s;t, from Solomon down to our own days, who has not, in &s;ome fits of repentance or di&s;appointment, uttered &s;ome &s;harp reflection upon the emptine&s;s of human plea&s;ure, and of the vanity of vanities which di&s;covers it&s;elf in all the pur&s;uits of mortal man.&mdash;But the mi&s;chief has been, that, though &s;o many good things have been &s;aid, they have generally had the fate to be con&s;idered, either as the overflowings of di&s;gu&s;t from &s;ated appetites which could no longer reli&s;h the plea&s;ures of life, or as the de|clamatory opinions of reclu&s;e and &s;plenetic men, who had never ta&s;ted them at all, and, con&s;equently, were thought no judges of the matter. So that 'tis no great wonder, if the greate&s;t part of &s;uch reflections, how|ever ju&s;t in them&s;elves, and founded on truth and a knowledge of the world, are found to leave little im|pre&s;&s;ion where the imagination was already heated with great expectations of future happine&s;s; and that the be&s;t
<PB N="253" REF="021451_0252_0FB3F77DB07F2170">
lectures that have been read upon the vanity of the world, &s;o &s;eldom &s;top a man in the pur&s;uit of the object of his de&s;ire, or give him half the conviction, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it will, and what the experience of his own life, or a careful ob&s;ervation upon the life of others, do at length generally confirm to us all.</P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood as if I was denying the reality of plea&s;ures, or di&s;puting the being of them, any more than one would the reality of pain&mdash;yet I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that there is a plain di&s;tinction to be made be|twixt plea&s;ures and happine&s;s. For though there can be no happine&s;s without plea&s;ure&mdash;yet the rever&s;e of the propo&s;ition will not hold true.&mdash;We are &s;o made, that, from the common gratifications of our appetites, and the impre&s;&s;ions of a thou&s;and objects, we &s;natch the one like a tran&s;ient gleam, without being &s;uffered to ta&s;te the other and enjoy the perpetual &s;un&s;hine and fair weather which con&s;tantly attend it. This, I contend, is only to be found in religion&mdash;in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of virtue&mdash;and the &s;ure and certain hopes of a better life, which brightens all our pro&s;pects, and leaves no room to dread di&s;appointments&mdash;becau&s;e the expectation of it is built upon a rock who&s;e foundations are as deep as tho&s;e of heaven and hell.</P>
<P>And though, in our pilgrimage through this world&mdash; &s;ome of us may be &s;o fortunate as to meet with &s;ome clear fountains by the way that may cool, for a few moments, the heat of this great thir&s;t of happine&s;s&mdash;yet our Saviour, who knew the world, though he enjoyed but little of it, tells us, that who&s;oever drinketh of this water will thir&s;t again:&mdash;and we all find by experience it is &s;o, and by rea&s;on that it always mu&s;t be &s;o.</P>
<P>I conclude with a &s;hort ob&s;ervation upon Solomon's evidence in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Never did the bu&s;y brain of a lean and hectic chymi&s;t &s;earch for the philo&s;opher's &s;tone with more pains and ardor than this great man did after happine&s;s. He was one of the wi&s;e&s;t enquirers into nature&mdash;had tried all her powers and capacities; and, after a thou&s;and vain &s;peculations and vile experiments, he affirmed at length, it lay hid in no one thing he had tried: like the chy|mi&s;t's projections, all had ended in &s;moke, or, what was
<PB N="254" REF="021451_0253_0FB3F77F1CA81AF8">
wor&s;e, in vanity and vexation of &s;pirit.&mdash;The conclu|&s;ion of the whole matter was this&mdash;that he advi&s;es every man who would be happy, to fear God and keep his commandments.</P>

<HEAD>V. ON THE DEATH OF CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>THE Redemption of man is one of the mo&s;t glorious works of the Almighty. If the hour of the creation of the world was great and illu&s;trious; that hour, when, from the dark and formle&s;s ma&s;s, this fair &s;y&s;tem of na|ture aro&s;e at the Divine command; when "the morn|ing &s;tars &s;ang together, and all the &s;ons of God &s;houted for joy;"&mdash;no le&s;s illu&s;trious is the hour of the re&s;tora|tion of the world; the hour, when, from condemnation and mi&s;ery, it emerged into happine&s;s and peace. With le&s;s external maje&s;ty it was attended, but is, on that account, the more wonderful, that, under an appear|ance &s;o &s;imple, &s;uch great events were covered.</P>
<P>In the hour of Chri&s;t's death the long &s;eries of pro|phecies, vi&s;ions, types, and figures, was accompli&s;hed. This was the center in which they all met; this the point towards which they had tended and verged, throughout the cour&s;e of &s;o many generations. You behold the Law and the Prophets &s;tanding, if we may &s;o &s;peak, at the foot of the cro&s;s, and doing homage. You behold Mo&s;es and Aaron bearing the ark of the covenant; David and Elijah pre&s;enting the oracle of te&s;timony. You behold all the prie&s;ts and &s;acrifices, all the rites and ordinances, all the types and &s;ymbols, a&s;&s;embled together to receive their con&s;ummation. With|out the death of Chri&s;t, the wor&s;hip and ceremonies of the law would have remained a pompous, but unmean|ing in&s;titution. In the hour when he was crucified, "the book with the &s;even &s;eals" was opened. Every rite a&s;&s;umed its &s;ignificancy; every prediction met its event; every &s;ymbol di&s;played its corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>This was the hour of the abolition of the Law, and the introduction of the Go&s;pel; the hour of terminating the old, and of beginning the new di&s;pen&s;ation of reli|gious knowledge and wor&s;hip throughout the earth. Viewed in this light, it forms the mo&s;t augu&s;t aera which is to be found in the hi&s;tory of mankind. When Chri&s;t was &s;uffering on the cro&s;s, we are informed by one of
<PB N="255" REF="021451_0254_0FB3F7809E173B58">
the Evangeli&s;ts, that he &s;aid, "I thir&s;t;" and that they filled a &s;punge with vinegar, and put it to his mouth. "After he had ta&s;ted the vinegar, knowing that all things were now accompli&s;hed, and the &s;cripture ful|filled, he &s;aid, "It is fini&s;hed;" that is, This offered draught of vinegar was the la&s;t circum&s;tance predicted by an ancient prophet that remained to be fulfilled. The vi&s;ion and the prophecy are now &s;ealed: the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation is clo&s;ed. "And he bowed his head, and gave up the gho&s;t."&mdash;Significantly was the veil of the temple rent in this hour; for the glory then departed from between the cherubims. The legal high-prie&s;t delivered up his Urim and Thummim, his brea&s;t-plate, his robes, and his incen&s;e; and CHRIST &s;tood forth as the great High-prie&s;t of all &s;ucceeding generations. By that one &s;acrifice which he now offered, he aboli&s;hed &s;acrifices for ever. Altars on which the fire had blazed for ages were now to &s;moke no more. Victims were no more to bleed. "Not with the blood of bulls and goats, but with his own blood, he now entered into the Holy Place, there to appear in the pre&s;ence of God for us"</P>
<P>This was the hour of a&s;&s;ociation and union to all the wor&s;hippers of God. When Chri&s;t &s;aid "It is fini&s;hed," he threw down the wall of partition which had &s;o long divided the Gentile from the Jew. He gathered into one all the faithful, out of every kindred and people. He proclaimed the hour to be come, when the knowledge of the true God &s;hould be no longer confined to one nation, nor his wor&s;hip to one temple; but over all the earth, the wor&s;hippers of the Father &s;hould "&s;erve him in &s;pirit and in truth." From that hour, they who dwelt in the "uttermo&s;t ends of the earth, &s;trangers to the covenant of promi&s;e," began to be "brought nigh." In that hour, the light of the go&s;pel dawned from afar on the Briti&s;h i&s;lands.</P>
<P>This was the hour of Chri&s;t's triumph over all the powers of darkne&s;s; the hour in which he overthrew dominions and thrones, "led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. The conte&s;t which the kingdom of darkne&s;s had long maintained again&s;t the kingdom of light, was now brought to its cri&s;is. The period was come, when "the &s;eed of the woman &s;hould brui&s;e the
<PB N="256" REF="021451_0255_0FB3F7821CA3DD08">
head of the &s;erpent." For many ages, the mo&s;t gro&s;s &s;uper&s;tition had filled the earth. "The glory of the incorruptible God was" every where, except in the land of Judea, "changed into images made like to corrup|tible man, and to birds, and bea&s;ts, and creeping things." The world, which the Almighty created for him&s;elf, &s;eemed to have become a temple of idols. Even to vices and pa&s;&s;ions altars were rai&s;ed; and, what was intitled Religion, was, in effect, a di&s;cipline of impurity. In the mid&s;t of this univer&s;al darkne&s;s, Satan had erec|ted his throne; and the learned and poli&s;hed, as well as the &s;avage nations, bowed down before him. But at the hour when Chri&s;t appeared on the cro&s;s, the &s;ignal of his defeat was given. His kingdom &s;uddenly de|parted from him; the reign of Idolatry pa&s;&s;ed away: He was "beheld to fall like lightening from heaven." In that hour, the foundation of every Pagan temple &s;hook; the &s;tatute of every fal&s;e god tottered on its ba&s;e. The prie&s;t fled from his falling &s;hrine; and the heathen oracles became dumb for ever.</P>
<P>Death al&s;o, the la&s;t foe of man, was the victim of this hour. The formidable appearance of the &s;pectre remained, but his dart was taken away: for, in the hour when Chri&s;t expiated guilt, he di&s;armed death, by &s;ecuring the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t. When he &s;aid to his penitent fellow-&s;ufferer, "To-day thou &s;halt be with me in paradi&s;e," he announced to all his followers the certainty of heavenly bli&s;s. He declared "the cheru|bims" to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and the "flaming &s;word" to be &s;heathed, which had been appointed at the fall "to keep from man the way of the Tree of life." Faint, before this period, had been the hope, indi&s;tinct the pro&s;pect, which even good men enjoyed of the heavenly kingdom. "Life and immortality were now brought to light." From the hill of Calvary, the fir&s;t clear and certain view was given to the world of the everla&s;ting man&s;ions. Since that hour, they have been the perpe|tual con&s;olation of believers in Chri&s;t. Under trouble, they &s;oothe their minds; amid&s;t temptations they &s;up|port their virtue; and, in their dying moments, enable them to &s;ay, "O death! where is thy &s;ting? O grave! where is thy victory?"</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. ELOQUENCE OF THE SENATE.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I. SPEECH of the EARL of CHESTERFIELD, in the HOUSE of LORDS, FEB. 22. 1740, on the PENSION BILL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now &s;o late, and &s;o much has been &s;aid in fa|vor of the motion for the &s;econd reading of the Pen&s;ion Bill, by Lords much abler than I am, that I &s;hall detain you but a very &s;hort while with what I have to &s;ay upon the &s;ubject. It has been &s;aid by a Noble Duke, that this bill can be looked on only as a bill for preventing a grievance that is fore&s;een, and not as a bill for remedying a grievance that is al|ready felt; becau&s;e it is not a&s;&s;erted, nor &s;o much as in&s;inuated in the preamble of the bill, that any corrupt practices are now made u&s;e of, for gaining an undue influence over the other Hou&s;e. My Lords, this was the very rea&s;on for bringing in the bill. They could not a&s;&s;ert, that any &s;uch practices are now made u&s;e of, without a proof; and the means for coming at this proof, is what they want, and what they propo&s;e to get by this bill. They &s;u&s;pect there are &s;uch practices, but they cannot prove it. The crime is of &s;uch a &s;ecret na|ture, that it can very &s;eldom be proved by witne&s;&s;es; and therefore they want to put it to the trial, at lea&s;t, of being proved by the oath of one of the parties; which is a method often taken in ca&s;es that can admit of no other proof. This is, therefore, no argument of the grievance not being felt; for a man may, very &s;en&s;ibly, feel a grievance, and yet may not be able to prove it.</P>
<P>That there is a &s;u&s;picion of &s;ome &s;uch practices be|ing now made u&s;e of, or that they will &s;oon be made u&s;e of, the many remon&s;trances from all parts of the united kingdoms are a &s;ufficient proof. That this &s;u&s;|picion has crept into the other Hou&s;e, their having &s;o frequently &s;ent up this bill is a manife&s;t demon&s;tration,
<PB N="258" REF="021451_0257_0FB3F7851CB98400">
and a &s;trong argument for its being nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;ome &s;uch bill pa&s;&s;ed into a law. The other hou&s;e mu&s;t be allowed to be better judges of what pa&s;&s;es, or mu&s;t pa&s;s, within their own walls, than we can pretend to be. It is evident, they &s;u&s;pect that corrupt practices have been, or &s;oon may be, made u&s;e of, for gaining an undue influence over &s;ome of their mea&s;ures; and they have calculated this bill for curing the evil if it is felt, for preventing it if it is only fore&s;een. That any &s;uch practices have been actually made u&s;e of, or are now made u&s;e of, is what I &s;hall not pretend to affirm; but I am &s;ure I &s;hall not affirm the contrary. If any &s;uch are made u&s;e of, I will, with confidence, vindicate his Maje&s;ty. I am &s;ure he knows nothing of them. I am &s;ure he will di&s;dain to &s;uffer them: but I cannot pa&s;s &s;uch a compliment upon his mini&s;ters, nor upon any &s;et of mini&s;ters that ever was, or ever will be, in this na|tion; and, therefore, I think I cannot more faithfully, more effectually, &s;erve his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, as well as his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, than by putting it out of the power of mi|ni&s;ters to gain any corrupt influence over either Hou&s;e of Parliament. Such an attempt may be nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ecurity of the mini&s;ter, but never can be nece&s;&s;ary, for it mu&s;t always be incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ecurity of his Ma&s;ter: and the more nece&s;&s;ary it is for the mini|&s;ter's &s;ecurity, the more incon&s;i&s;tent it will always be with the King's, and the more dangerous to the liberties of the nation.</P>
<P>To pretend, my Lords, that this bill dimini&s;hes, or any way encroaches upon the prerogative, is &s;omething very &s;trange. What prerogative, my Lords? Has the Crown a prerogative to bribe, to infringe the law, by &s;ending its pen&s;ioners into the other Hou&s;e? To &s;ay &s;o, is de&s;troying the credit, the authority of the Crown, under the pretence of &s;upporting its prerogative. If his Maje&s;ty knew that any man received a pen&s;ion from him, or any thing like a pen&s;ion, and yet kept his &s;eat in the other Hou&s;e, he would him&s;elf declare it, or withdraw his pen&s;ion, becau&s;e he knows it is again&s;t law. This bill, therefore, no way dimini&s;hes or en|croaches upon the prerogatives of the Crown, which can never be exerci&s;ed but for the public good. It dimi|ni&s;hes
<PB N="259" REF="021451_0258_0FB3F7869E91CE40">
only the prerogatives u&s;urped by mini&s;ters which are never exerci&s;ed but for its de&s;truction. The Crown may &s;till reward merit in the proper way, that is open|ly. The bill is intended, and can operate only again&s;t clande&s;tine rewards or gratuities given by mini&s;ters. The&s;e are &s;candalous, and never were, nor will be, given but for &s;candalous &s;ervices.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable, my Lords, it is even divert|ing, to &s;ee &s;uch a &s;queami&s;hne&s;s about perjury upon this occa&s;ion, among&s;t tho&s;e, who, upon other occa&s;ions, have invented and enacted multitudes of oaths, to be taken by men who are under great temptations, from their private intere&s;t, to be guilty of perjury. Is not this the ca&s;e of almo&s;t every oath that relates to the collection of the public revenue, or to the exerci&s;e of any office? Is not this perjury one of the chief objec|tions made by the Di&s;&s;enters again&s;t the Te&s;t and Cor|poration Act? And &s;hall we &s;how a le&s;s concern for the pre&s;ervation of our con&s;titution, than for the pre&s;erva|tion of our church? The reverend bench &s;hould be cau|tious of making u&s;e of this argument; for if they will not allow us an oath for the pre&s;ervation of the former, it may induce many people to think they ought not to be allowed an oath for the pre&s;ervation of the latter.</P>
<P>By this time, I hope my Lords, all the inconveni|ences pretended to ari&s;e from this bill have vani&s;hed; and therefore I &s;hall con&s;ider &s;ome of the arguments brought to &s;how that it is not nece&s;&s;ary. Here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that mo&s;t of the arguments made u&s;e of for this purpo&s;e, are equally &s;trong for a repeal of the laws we have already in being again&s;t admitting pen&s;ioners to &s;it and vote in the other Hou&s;e. If it be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e, that a gentleman of great e&s;tate and ancient family, can, by a pen&s;ion, be influenced to do what he ought not to do; and if we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that none but &s;uch gentlemen can ever get into the other Hou&s;e, I am &s;ure the laws for preventing pen&s;ioners from ha|ving &s;eats in that Hou&s;e are quite unnece&s;&s;ary, and ought to be repealed. Therefore, if the&s;e arguments prevail with your Lord&s;hips to put a negative upon the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, I &s;hall expect to &s;ee that negative fol|lowed by a motion for the repeal of tho&s;e laws; nay, in
<PB N="260" REF="021451_0259_0FB3F7881E967D78">
a few &s;e&s;&s;ions, I &s;hall expect to &s;ee a bill brought in for preventing any man's being a member of the other Hou&s;e but &s;uch as have &s;ome place or pen&s;ion under the Crown. As an argument for &s;uch a bill, it might be &s;aid, that his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t faithful &s;ubjects ought to be cho&s;en members of Parliament, and that tho&s;e gen|tlemen will always be mo&s;t faithful to the King that receive the King's money. I &s;hall grant, my Lords, that &s;uch gentlemen will be always the mo&s;t faithful, and the mo&s;t obedient to the mini&s;ter; but for this very rea&s;on, I &s;hould be for excluding them from Parliament. The king's real intere&s;t, however much he may be made by his mini&s;ters to mi&s;take it, mu&s;t always be the &s;ame with the people's; but the mini&s;ter's intere&s;t is generally di&s;tinct from, and often contrary to both: therefore I &s;hall always be for excluding, as much as po&s;&s;ible, from Parliament, every man who is under the lea&s;t in|ducement to prefer the intere&s;t of the mini&s;ter to that of both king and people: and this I take to be the ca&s;e of every gentleman, let his e&s;tate and family be what they will, that holds a pen&s;ion at the will of the mini|&s;ter.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who &s;ay, they depend &s;o much upon the ho|nor, integrity and impartiality of men of family and fortune, &s;eem to think our con&s;titution can never be di&s;|&s;olved, as long as we have the &s;hadow of a Parliament. My opinion, my Lord, is &s;o very different, that if ever our con&s;titution be di&s;&s;olved, if ever an ab&s;olute mo|narchy be e&s;tabli&s;hed in this kingdom, I am convinced it will be under that &s;hadow. Our con&s;titution con&s;i&s;ts in the two Hou&s;es of Parliament being a check upon the Crown, as well as upon one another. If that check &s;hould ever be removed, if the Crown &s;hould, by corrupt means, by places, pen&s;ions, and bribes, get the ab&s;olute direc|tion of our two Hou&s;es of Parliament, our con&s;titution will, from that moment, be de&s;troyed. There would be no occa&s;ion for the Crown to proceed any farther. It would be ridiculous to lay a&s;ide the forms of Parliament; for under that &s;hadow our King would be more ab&s;o|lute, and might govern more arbitrarily, than he could do without it. A gentleman of family and fortune, would not, perhaps, for the &s;ake of a pen&s;ion, agree to
<PB N="261" REF="021451_0260_0FB3F7899C352548">
lay a&s;ide the forms of government; becau&s;e, by his ve|nal &s;ervice there, he earns his infamous pen&s;ion, and could not expect the continuance of it if tho&s;e forms were laid a&s;ide: but a gentleman of family and fortune may for the &s;ake of a pen&s;ion, whil&s;t he is in Parlia|ment, approve of the mo&s;t blundering mea&s;ures, con&s;ent to the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive and u&s;ele&s;s grants, enact the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive laws, pa&s;s the mo&s;t villainous accounts, acquit the mo&s;t heinous criminals, and condemn the mo&s;t inno|cent per&s;ons at the de&s;ire of that mini&s;ter who pays him his pen&s;ion. And, if a majority of &s;uch Hou&s;e of Parlia|ment con&s;i&s;ted of &s;uch men, would it not be ridiculous in us to talk of our con&s;titution, or to &s;ay we had any liberty left?&mdash;This misfortune, this terrible condition, we may be reduced to by corruption: as brave, as free a people as we, the Romans, were reduced to it by the &s;ame means; and to prevent &s;uch a horrid cata&s;trophe, is the de&s;ign of this bill.</P>
<P>If people would at all think, if they would con&s;ider the con&s;equence of corruption, there would be no oc|ca&s;ion, my Lords, for making laws again&s;t it. It would appear &s;o horrible, that no man would allow it to ap|proach him. The corrupted ought to con&s;ider, that they do not &s;ell their vote, or their country only: the&s;e, per|haps, they may di&s;regard; but they &s;ell like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;e them|&s;elves: they become the bond &s;haves of the corrupter, who corrupts them, not for their &s;akes, but for his own. No man ever corrupted another for the &s;ake of doing him a &s;ervice. And, therefore, if people would but con&s;ider, they would always reject the offer with di&s;dain. But this is not to be expected. The hi&s;tories of all countries, the hi&s;tory even of our own country, &s;hows it is not to be depended on. The proffered bribe, people thinks will &s;atisfy the immediate cravings of &s;ome infa|mous appetite; and this makes them &s;wallow the allu|ring bait, though the liberties of their country, the hap|pine&s;s of their po&s;terity, and even their own liberty, e|vidently depend upon their refu&s;ing it. This makes it nece&s;&s;ary, in every free &s;tate, to contrive, if po&s;&s;ible, effec|tual laws again&s;t corruption, and, as the laws we now have for excluding pen&s;ioners from the other Hou&s;e, are allowed to be ineffectual, we ought to make a trial, at
<PB N="262" REF="021451_0261_0FB3F78B20062690">
ea&s;t, of the remedy now propo&s;ed; for, though it &s;hould prove ineffectual, it will be attended with this advan|tage, that it will put us upon contriving &s;ome other re|medy that may be effectual; and the &s;ooner &s;uch a re|medy is contrived and applied, the le&s;s danger we &s;hall be expo&s;ed to of falling into that fatal di&s;temper from which no free &s;tate, where it has once become general, has ever yet recovered.</P>

<HEAD>II. LORD MANSFIELD's SPEECH in the HOUSE of LORDS, 1770, on the BILL for the further preventing the delays of JUSTICE by rea&s;on of PRIVILEGE of PARLIAMENT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I con&s;ider the importance of this bill to your Lord&s;hips, I am not &s;urpri&s;ed it has taken up &s;o much of your con&s;ideration. It is a bill, indeed, of no common magnitude; it is no le&s;s than to take away from two thirds of the legi&s;lative body of this great kingdom, certain privileges and immunities of which they have been long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Perhaps there is no &s;ituation the human mind can be placed in, that is &s;o difficult and &s;o trying, as when it is made a judge in its own cau&s;e. There is &s;ome|thing implanted in the brea&s;t of man, &s;o attached to &s;elf, &s;o tenacious of privileges once obtained, that, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, either to di&s;cu&s;s, with impartiality, or decide with ju&s;tice, has ever been held as the &s;ummit of all hu|man virtue. The bill now in que&s;tion puts your Lord|&s;hips in this very predicament; and I doubt not but the wi&s;dom of your deci&s;ion will convince the world, that where &s;elf-intere&s;t and ju&s;tice are in oppo&s;ite &s;cales the latter will ever preponderate with your Lord&s;hips.</P>
<P>Privileges have been granted to legi&s;lators in all ages and in all countries. The practice is founded in wi&s;|dom: and, indeed, it is peculiarly e&s;&s;ential to the con&s;ti|tution of this country, that the members of both Hou&s;es &s;hould be free in their per&s;ons in ca&s;es of civil &s;uits; for there may come a time when the &s;afety and welfare of this whole empire may depend upon their attendance in Parliament. God forbid that I &s;hould advi&s;e any mea|&s;ure that would in future endanger the &s;tate: but the bill before your Lord&s;hips has, I am confident, no &s;uch
<PB N="263" REF="021451_0262_0FB3F78C9C4CEB38">
tendency; for it expre&s;sly &s;ecures the per&s;ons of mem|bers of either Hou&s;e in all civil &s;uits. This being the ca&s;e, I confe&s;s, when I &s;ee many noble Lords, for who&s;e judgment I have a very great re&s;pect, &s;tanding up to oppo&s;e a bill which is calculated merely to facilitate the recovery of ju&s;t and legal debts, I am a&s;toni&s;hed and amazed. They, I doubt not, oppo&s;e the bill upon pub|lic principles: I would not wi&s;h to in&s;inuate, that pri|vate intere&s;t had the lea&s;t weight in their determination.</P>
<P>This bill has been frequently propo&s;ed, and as fre|quently mi&s;carried: but it was always lo&s;t in the Lower Hou&s;e. Little did I think, when it had pa&s;&s;ed the Com|mons, that it po&s;&s;ibly could have met with &s;uch oppo|&s;ition here. Shall it be &s;aid, that you, my Lords, the grand council of the nation, the highe&s;t judicial and le|gi&s;lative body of the realm, endeavor to evade by pri|vilege tho&s;e very laws which you enforce on your fel|low-&s;ubjects?&mdash;Forbid it ju&s;tice!&mdash;I am &s;ure, were the noble Lords as well acquainted as I am with but half the difficulties and delays occa&s;ioned in the courts of ju&s;tice under pretence of privilege, they would not, nay they could not, oppo&s;e this bill.</P>
<P>I have waited with patience to hear what arguments might be urged again&s;t the bill, but I have waited in vain: the truth is, there is no argument that can weigh again&s;t it. The ju&s;tice and expediency of the bill are &s;uch as render it &s;elf-evident. It is a propo&s;ition of that nature, that can neither be weakened by argument, nor intangled with &s;ophi&s;try. Much, indeed, has been &s;aid by &s;ome noble Lords on the wi&s;dom of our ance|&s;tors, and how differently they thought from us. They not only decreed, that privilege &s;hould prevent all civil &s;uits from proceeding during the &s;itting of parliament, but likewi&s;e granted protection to the very &s;ervants of members. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing on the wi&s;dom of our an|ce&s;tors; it might perhaps appear invidious: that is not nece&s;&s;ary in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. I &s;hall only &s;ay, that the noble Lords who flatter them&s;elves with the weight of that reflection, &s;hould remember, that as circum&s;tances alter, things them&s;elves &s;hould alter. Formerly, it was not &s;o fa&s;hionable either for ma&s;ters or &s;ervants to run in debt as it is at pre&s;ent. Formerly we were not that
<PB N="264" REF="021451_0263_0FB3F78E1F595848">
great commercial nation we are at pre&s;ent; nor former|ly were merchants and manufacturers members of Par|liament as at pre&s;ent. The ca&s;e now is very different: both merchants and manufacturers are, with great pro|priety, elected members of the Lower Hou&s;e. Com|merce having thus got into the legi&s;lative body of the kingdom, privilege mu&s;t be done away. We all know, that the very &s;oul and e&s;&s;ence of trade are regular pay|ments; and &s;ad experience teaches us, that there are men, who will not make their regular payments with|out the compul&s;ive power of the laws. The law then ought to be equally open to all: any exemption to par|ticular men, or particular ranks of men, is, in a free and commercial country, a &s;oleci&s;m of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t nature.</P>
<P>But I will not trouble your Lord&s;hips with arguments for that which is &s;ufficiently evident without any. I &s;hall only &s;ay a few words to &s;ome noble Lords, who for&s;ee much inconveniency from the per&s;ons of their &s;er|vants being liable to be arre&s;ted. One noble Lord ob|&s;erves, That the coachman of a peer may be arre&s;ted while he is driving his ma&s;ter to the Hou&s;e, and, con&s;e|quently, he will not be able to attend his duty in Par|liament. If this were actually to happen, there are &s;o many methods by which the member might &s;till get to the Hou&s;e, that I can hardly think the noble Lord is &s;e|rious in his objection. Another noble Peer &s;aid, That by this bill one might lo&s;e their mo&s;t valuable and hone&s;t &s;ervants. This I hold to be a contradiction in terms: for he can neither be a valuable &s;ervant, nor an hone&s;t man who gets into debt which he is neither able nor willing to pay, till compelled by law. If my &s;ervant, by unfore&s;een accidents, has got in debt, and I &s;till wi&s;h to retain him, I certainly would pay the debt. But upon no principle of liberal legi&s;lation whatever, can my &s;ervant have a title to &s;et his creditors at defiance, while, for forty &s;hillings only, the hone&s;t trade&s;man may be torn from his family and looked up in a gaol. It is mon|&s;truous inju&s;tice! I flatter my&s;elf, however, the de|termination of this day will entirely put an end to all &s;uch partial proceedings for the future, by pa&s;&s;ing into a law the bill now under your Lord&s;hips con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I come now to &s;peak, upon what, indeed, I would have
<PB N="265" REF="021451_0264_0FB3F78FA028A2B0">
gladly avoided, had I not been particularly pointed at for the part I have taken in this bill. It has been &s;aid by a noble Lord on my left hand, that I likewi&s;e am running the race of popularity. If the noble Lord means by popularity, that applau&s;e be&s;towed by after ages on good and virtuous actions, I have long been &s;truggling in that race; to what purpo&s;e, all trying time can alone determine: but if the noble Lord means that mu&s;hroom popularity that is rai&s;ed without merit and lo&s;t with|out a crime, he is much mi&s;taken in his opinion. I defy the noble Lord to-point out a &s;ingle action of my life, where the popularity of the times ever had the &s;malle&s;t influence on my determinations. I thank God I have a more permanent and &s;teady rule for my conduct,&mdash;the dictates of my own brea&s;t. Tho&s;e that have forgone that plea&s;ing advi&s;er, and given up their mind to the &s;lave of every popular impul&s;e, I &s;incerely pity: I pity them &s;till more, if their vanity leads them to mi&s;take the &s;houts of a mob for the trumpet of fame. Experience might inform them, that many who have been &s;aluted with the huzzas of a crowd one day, have received their execrations the next; and many, who, by the popula|rity of their times, have been held up as &s;potle&s;s pa|triots, have, neverthele&s;s, appeared upon the hi&s;torian's page, when truth has triumphed over delu&s;ion, the a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins of liberty. Why then the noble Lord can think I am ambitious of pre&s;ent popularity, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cho of folly, and &s;hadow of renown, I am at a lo&s;s to determine. Be|&s;ides, I do not know that the bill now before your Lord|&s;hips will be popular; it depends much upon the ca|price of the day. It may not be popular to compel peo|ple to pay their debts; and, in that ca&s;e, the pre&s;ent mu&s;t be a very unpopular bill. It may not be popular nei|ther to take away any of the privileges of Parliament: for I very well remember, and many of your Lord&s;hips may remember, that not long ago the popular cry was for the exten&s;ion of privilege; and &s;o far did they carry it at that time, that it was &s;aid that the privilege pro|tected members even in criminal actions; nay, &s;uch was the power of popular prejudices over weak minds, that the very deci&s;ions of &s;ome of the courts were tinc|tured with that doctrine. It was undoubtedly an abo|minable
<PB N="266" REF="021451_0265_0FB3F7911EDD4A78">
doctrine; I thought &s;o then and think &s;o &s;till: but, neverthele&s;s, it was a popular doctrine; and came immediately from tho&s;e who are called the friends of li|berty; how de&s;ervedly time will &s;how. True liberty, in my opinion, can only exi&s;t when ju&s;tice is equally admi|ni&s;tered to all; to the king, and to the beggar. Where is the ju&s;tice then, or where is the law, that protects a member of parliament more than any other man, from the puni&s;hment due to his crimes? The laws of this country allow of no place, nor no employment, to be a &s;anctuary for crimes; and where I have the honor to &s;it as judge, neither royal favor nor popular applau&s;e &s;hall ever protect the guilty.</P>
<P>I have now only to beg pardon for having employed &s;o much of your Lord&s;hips time; and I am &s;orry a bill, fraught with &s;o many good con&s;equences, has not met with an abler advocate: but I doubt not your Lord&s;hips determination will convince the world, that a bill calcu|lated to contribute &s;o much to the equal di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice as the pre&s;ent, requires with your Lord&s;hips but very little &s;upport.</P>

<HEAD>III. Speech of Mr. PITT (created afterwards EARL of CHATHAM) in the Hou&s;e of Commons, Dec. 17th, 1765, on the AMERICAN STAMP-ACT.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE been charged with giving birth to &s;edition in America. Sorry I am to hear the liberty of &s;peech in this Hou&s;e, imputed as a crime. But the imputation &s;hall not di&s;courage me. It is a liberty I mean to ex|erci&s;e. No gentleman ought to be afraid to exerci&s;e it. It is a liberty by which the gentleman (Mr. Grenville) who calumm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tes it, might have profited. He ought to have de&s;i&s;ted from his project. The gentleman te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> us America is ob&s;tinate; America is almo&s;t in open rebel|lion. I rejoice that America has re&s;i&s;ted. Three mil|lions of people, &s;o dead to all the feelings of liberty, as voluntarily to &s;ubmit to be &s;laves, would have been fit in&s;truments to make &s;lav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the re&s;t. I come not here armed at all points, with law ca&s;es and acts of parlia|ment, with the &s;tatute-book doubled down in dog-ears, to defend the cau&s;e of liberty: if I had, I my&s;elf would have cited the two ca&s;es of Che&s;ter and Durham. I would have cited them to have &s;hown, that even under
<PB N="267" REF="021451_0266_0FB3F7929BA83340">
any arbitrary reigns, parliaments were a&s;hamed of tax|ing a people without their con&s;ent, and allowed them repre&s;entatives. Why did the gentleman confine him|&s;elf to Che&s;ter and Durham? He might have taken a higher example in Wales; Wales that never was taxed by Parliament till it was incorporated. I would not de|bate a particular point of law with the gentleman: I know his abilities. I have been obliged to his diligent re&s;earches. But, for the defence of liberty upon a gene|ral principle, upon a con&s;titutional principle, it is a ground on which I &s;tand firm; on which I dare meet any man. The gentleman tells us of many that are tax|ed, and are not repre&s;ented. The India Company, mer|chants, &s;tock-holders, manufacturers. Surely many of the&s;e are repre&s;ented in other capacities, as owners of land, or as freemen of boroughs. It is a misfortune that more are not actually repre&s;ented. But they are all in|habitants, and, as &s;uch, are virtually repre&s;ented. Ma|ny have it in their option to be actually repre&s;ented. They have connections with tho&s;e that elect, and they have influence over them.</P>
<P>When I had the honor to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty, there were not wanting &s;ome, to propo&s;e to me to burn my fingers with an American &s;tamp-act. With the enemy at their back, with our bayonets at their brea&s;ts, in the day of their di&s;tre&s;s, perhaps the Americans would have &s;ubmited to the impo&s;ition; but it would have been ta|king an ungenerous and unju&s;t advantage. The gentle|man boa&s;ts of his bounties to America! Are not the&s;e bounties intended finally for the benefit of this king|dom? If they are not, he has mi&s;applied the national trea&s;ures. I am no courtier of America; I &s;tand up for this kingdom: I maintain that the Parliament has a right to bind, to re&s;train America. Our legi&s;lative power over America is &s;overeign and &s;upreme. When it cea&s;|es to be &s;overeign and &s;upreme, I would advi&s;e every gen|tleman to &s;ell his lands, if he can, and embark for that country. When two countries are connected together, like England and her colonies, without being incorporat|ed, the one mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily govern; the greater mu&s;t rule the le&s;s; but &s;o rule it, as not to contradict the fun|damental principles that are common to both.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="021451_0267_0FB3F7941F149AA0">If the gentleman does not under&s;tand the difference between internal and external taxes, I cannot help it; but there is a plain di&s;tinction between taxes levied for the purpo&s;es of rai&s;ing a revenue, and duties impo&s;ed for the regulation of trade, for the accommodation of the &s;ubject; although, in the con&s;equences, &s;ome revenue might incidentally ari&s;e from the latter.</P>
<P>The gentleman a&s;ks, when were the colonies emanci|pated? But I de&s;ire to know, when they were made &s;laves? But I dwell not upon words. When I had the honor of &s;erving his Maje&s;ty, I availed my&s;elf of the means of information which I derived from my office: I &s;peak, therefore, from knowledge. My materials were good. I was at pains to collect, to dige&s;t, to con&s;ider them; and I will be bold to affirm, that the profits to Great Britain from the trade of the colonies, through all its branches, is two millions a-year. This is the fund that carried you triumphantly through the la&s;t war. The e&s;tates that were rented at two thou&s;and pounds a year, three&s;core years ago, are at three thou&s;and pounds at pre&s;ent. Tho&s;e e&s;tates &s;old them from fifteen to eighteen years purcha&s;e; the &s;ame may be now &s;old for thirty. You owe this to America. This is the price that America pays you for her protection. And &s;hall a mi&s;erable financier come with a boa&s;t, that he can fetch a pepper-corn into the exchequer, to the lo&s;s of millions to the nations? I dare not &s;ay how much high|er the&s;e profits may be augmented. Omitting the im|men&s;e increa&s;e of people by natural propagation in the northern-colonies, and the migration from every part of Europe, I am convinced the whole commercial &s;y&s;tem of America may be altered to advantage. You have prohibited where you ought to have encouraged, and you have encouraged where you ought to have prohibited. Improper re&s;traints have been laid on the continent in favor of the i&s;lands. Much is wrong, much may be a|mended for the general good of the whole.</P>
<P>A great deal has been &s;aid out of doors of the power, of the &s;trength of America. It is a topic that ought to be ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">iou&s;ly meddled with. In a good cau&s;e, on a found bottom, the force of this country can cru&s;h Ame|rica to atoms. I know the valor of your troops. I
<PB N="269" REF="021451_0268_0FB3F7959D369788">
know the &s;kill of your officers. There is not a company of foot that has &s;erved in America, out of which you may not pick a man of &s;ufficient knowledge and experi|ence to make a governor of a colony there. But, on this ground, on the &s;tamp-act, when &s;o many here will think it a crying inju&s;tice, I am one who will lift up my hands again&s;t it.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a cau&s;e your &s;ucce&s;s would be hazardous.&mdash; America, if &s;he fell, would fall like a &s;trong man. She would embrace the pillars of the &s;tate, and pull down the con&s;titution along with her. Is this your boa&s;ted peace? not to &s;heath the &s;word in its &s;cabbard, but to &s;heath it in the bowels of your countrymen? Will you quarrel with your&s;elves, now the whole Hou&s;e of Bour|bon is united again&s;t you? While France di&s;tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> your fi&s;heries in Newfoundland, embarra&s;&s;es your trade to A|frica, and with-holds from your &s;ubjects in Canada their property &s;tipulated by treaty; while the ran&s;om for Ma|nillas is denied by Spain, and its gallant conqueror ba&s;e|ly traduced into a mean plunderer, a gentleman (colonel Draper) who&s;e noble and generous &s;pirit would do ho|nor to the proude&s;t grandee of the country. The A|mericans have not acted in all things with prudence and temper. They have been wronged. They have been driven to madne&s;s by inju&s;tice. Will you puni&s;h them for the madne&s;s you have occa&s;ioned? Rather let pru|dence and temper come fir&s;t from this &s;ide. I will un|dertake for America that &s;he will follow the example.</P>

<HEAD>IV. SPEECH of Mr. FOX in the HOUSE of COM|MONS, Nov. 25, 1779, on the lo&s;s of AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not, in the whole hi&s;tory of this country, a period that re&s;embles the pre&s;ent, except the reign of the unfortunate Henry VI. His family, like that of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, did not claim the crown as their hereditary right; it was by revolutions they both ob|tained it. Henry was an amiable and pious prince; &s;o is his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty: Henry was the &s;on of the mo&s;t renowned monarch that ever &s;at upon the throne; George was the grand&s;on of a hero: Henry lo&s;t all his father's conque&s;ts, and all his hereditary provinces in France: George has already &s;een the conque&s;ts of his

<P>It cannot be a &s;ecret to this Hou&s;e, that the pre&s;ent Sovereign's claim to the throne of this country was found|ed o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly upon the delinquency of the Stuart family; a circum&s;tance that ought never to be out of his Maje&s;ty's recollection. It was true, indeed, that the unfortunate race of that name were univer&s;ally dete&s;ted in this coun|try, and therefore his Maje&s;ty had little to fear from their preten&s;ions: but he &s;hould ever remember, that it was the conduct of wicked and ignorant mini&s;ters that excited that dete&s;tation for them.

What he calls innocence may be an|other name for ignorance; and ignorance in a mini&s;ter is a crime of the fir&s;t magnitude. But the wide ruin that the coun&s;els of admini&s;tration have &s;pread through this great empire, and the mi&s;erable &s;tate to which they have reduced it in the &s;hort &s;pace in which the pre&s;ent Par|liament have been &s;itting, is &s;o far beyond the natural effects of mere ignorance, that I cannot help adopting the opinion of an honorable friend, that there is treach|ery at the bottom of the national councils. His Lord|&s;hip (Lord North) may flatter him&s;elf as much as he plea&s;es in the protection of a majority, or in the &s;ecu|rity of the law; but, when a nation is reduced to &s;uch a &s;tate of wretchedne&s;s and di&s;traction that the laws can afford the people no relief, they will give a mini&s;ter who has cau&s;ed the evil but little protection. What the law of the land could not do, the law of nature would ac|compli&s;h; the people would inevitably take up arms, and the fir&s;t characters in the kingdom would be &s;een in their ranks!</P>

<P>When the plaintiffs intreated me, as they did often, to undertake the management of the &s;uit, I advi&s;ed them to refer the difference, between them and their uncle the defendant, to private arbitration; thinking it the intere&s;t of both parties to conceal, as much as po&s;&s;ible, from the knowledge of the public, that there was any di&s;pute between them. But, as Diogiton knew that it was ea&s;y to prove him guilty of detaining the property of the plaintiffs his nephews, he fore&s;aw, that it would by no means an&s;wer his purpo&s;e to &s;ubmit his cau&s;e to the deci&s;ion of arbitrators. He has, therefore, deter|mined

to proceed to the utmo&s;t extremity of inju&s;tice, at the hazard of the con&s;equences of a pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>I mo&s;t humbly implore you, venerable judges, to grant the plaintiffs redre&s;s, if I &s;how you, as I hope I &s;hall in the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory manner, that the defend|ant, though &s;o nearly related to the unhappy orphans the plaintiffs, has treated them in &s;uch a manner, as would be &s;hameful among ab&s;olute &s;trangers.</P>
<P>I beg leave to lay before you, venerable judges, the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent pro&s;ecution, as follows:</P>
<P>Diodotus and Diogition were brothers, the children of the &s;ame father and the &s;ome mother. Upon their father's decea&s;e, they divided between them his move|ables; but his real e&s;tate they enjoyed conjunctly. Dio|dotus growing rich, Diogition offered him his only daugh|ter in marriage. By her Diodotus had two &s;ons and a daughter. Diodotus happening afterwards to be enrolled, in his turn, to go to the war under Thra&s;yllus, he call|ed together his wife, his brother's daughter, his wife's brother, and his own brother, who was likewi&s;e his father-in-law, and both uncle and grandfather to his children. He thought he could not tru&s;t the care of his children in properer hands than tho&s;e of his brother. He leaves in his cu&s;tody, his will, with five talents of &s;ilver. He gives him an account of &s;even talents, and forty minae be&s;ides, which were out at intere&s;t, and a thou&s;and minae, which were due to him by a per&s;on in the Cher&s;o|ne&s;us. He had ordered in his will, that, in ca&s;e of his death, one talent, and the hou&s;ehold-furniture, &s;hould be his wife's. He bequeathed farther, to his daughter, one talent, and twenty minae, and thirty Cyzicenian &s;taterers, and the re&s;t of his e&s;tate equally between his &s;ons. Settling his affairs thus, and leaving a copy of his will, he &s;ets out along with the army. He dies at Ephe&s;us. Diogition conceals from his daughter the death of her hu&s;band. He gets into his hands the will of his decea&s;ed brother, by pretending that it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for him to &s;how it as a voucher, in order to his tran&s;acting &s;ome affairs for his brother during his ab|&s;ence. At length, when he thought the decea&s;e of his brother could not much longer be concealed, he for|mally declares it. The family go into mourning.
<PB N="274" REF="021451_0273_0FB3F79D1C50EAA8">
They &s;tay one year at Piraeum, where their moveables were. In this time the produce of all that could be &s;old of the effects being &s;pent, he &s;ends the children to town, and gives his daughter, the widow of his brother Diodotus, to a &s;econd hu&s;band, and with her five thou|&s;and drachmae, of which the hu&s;band returns him one thou&s;and as a pre&s;ent. When the elde&s;t &s;on came to man's e&s;tate, about eight years after the departure of Diodotus, Diogiton calls the children together; tells them, that their father had left them twenty minae of &s;ilver, and thirty &s;taterers. "I have laid out (&s;ays he) of my own money, for your maintenance and education, a con&s;iderable &s;um. Nor did I grudge it, while I was in flouri&s;hing circum&s;tances, and could afford it. But, by unfore&s;een and irremediable misfortunes, I am redu|ced to an incapacity of continuing my kindne&s;s to you. Therefore as you (&s;peaking to the elde&s;t &s;on) are now of an age to &s;hift for your&s;elf, I would advi&s;e you to re&s;olve upon &s;ome employment, by which you may gain a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence."</P>
<P>The poor fatherle&s;s children were thunder&s;truck upon hearing this barbarous &s;peech. They fled in tears to their mother, and, with her, came to reque&s;t my pro|tection. Finding them&s;elves &s;tripped of the e&s;tate left them by their father, and reduced by their hard-hearted uncle and grandfather to ab&s;olute beggary, they in|treated that I would not de&s;ert them too: but, for the &s;ake of their &s;i&s;ter, my wife, would undertake their de|fence. The mother begged that I would bring about a meeting of the relations, to rea&s;on the matter with her father; and &s;aid, that though &s;he had never before &s;poke in any large company, e&s;pecially of men, &s;he would endeavor to lay before them the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and injuries of her family.</P>
<P>Diogiton being, with difficulty, brought to the meet|ing, the mother of the plaintiffs a&s;ked him, how he could have the heart to u&s;e her &s;ons in &s;uch a manner? "Are you not, Sir (&s;ays &s;he,) the uncle and the grandfather of the two fatherle&s;s youths? Are they not the children of your own brother and of your own daughter? How could they be more nearly related to you, unle&s;s they were your own &s;ons? And, though
<PB N="275" REF="021451_0274_0FB3F79E9D73BBE0">
you de&s;pi&s;ed all human authority, you ought to reve|rence the gods, who are witne&s;&s;es of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in you by the decea&s;ed father of the unhappy youths."</P>
<P>She then enumerated the &s;everal &s;ums, the property of the decea&s;ed, which had been received by Diogiton, and charged him with them, producing authentic evi|dence of every particular. "You have driven (&s;ays &s;he) out of their own hou&s;e, the children of your own daughter, in rags, unfurni&s;hed with the common de|cencies of life. You have deprived them of the effects, and of the money left them by their father. But you want to enrich the children you have had by my &s;tep|mother; which, without doubt, you might lawfully and properly do, if it were not at the expence and to the utter ruin of tho&s;e who&s;e fortunes were depo&s;ited in your hands, and whom, from affluence, you want to reduce to beggary; impiou&s;ly de&s;pi&s;ing the authority of the gods, injuring your own daughter, and violating the &s;acred will of the dead."</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mother having vented her grief in &s;uch bitter complaints as the&s;e, we were all, by &s;ympathy, &s;o touched with her afflictions, and the cruelty of her injurious father, that, when we con&s;idered in our own minds the hard u&s;age which the young innocents had met with, when we remembered the decea&s;ed Diodotus, and thought how unworthy a guardian he had cho&s;en for his children, there was not one of us who could re|frain from tears. And I per&s;uade my&s;elf, venerable judges, that you will not be unaffected with &s;o calami|tous a ca&s;e, when you come to con&s;ider attentively the various aggravations of the defendant's proceedings. Such unfaithfulne&s;s, in &s;o &s;olemn a tru&s;t, were it to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed, and con&s;equently to become common, would de&s;troy all confidence among mankind; &s;o that nobody would know how, or to whom, he could com|mit the management of his affairs in his ab&s;ence or after his death.</P>
<P>The defendant, at fir&s;t, would have denied his having had any effects of his brother's left in his hands; and when he found he could not get off that way, he then produced an account of &s;ums laid out, as he pretended, by him for the children, to &s;uch a value as is beyond all
<PB N="276" REF="021451_0275_0FB3F7A021CB8510">
belief; no le&s;s than &s;even talents of &s;ilver and &s;even thou&s;and drachmae. All this, he &s;aid, had been ex|pended in eight years, in the clothing and maintenance of two boys and a girl.</P>
<P>Had the defendant been a man of any principle, he would have bethought him&s;elf of laying out to advan|tage the fortune left in his hands by the decea&s;ed, for the benefit of the fatherle&s;s children. Had he bought with it lands or hou&s;es, the children might have been maintained out of the yearly rents, and the principal have been kept entire. But he does not &s;eem to have once thought of improving their fortune; but, on the contrary, to have contrived only how to &s;trip them.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t atrocious (for a &s;ingle action) of all his proceedings, is what follows. When he was made commander of the gallies, along with Alexis the &s;on of Ari&s;todicus, and, according to his own account, had been, on occa&s;ion of fit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g out the fleet and him&s;elf, at the expence of forty-eight m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nae <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of his own private pur&s;e,&mdash;he charges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ant-war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s with half this &s;um. Whereas the &s;tate not o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y exempts minors from public offices, but even grants them immunity for one year at lea&s;t after they come of age. And when he had fitted out, for a voyage to the Adriatic, a &s;hip of burden to the value of two talents, he told his daughter, the mo|ther o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is wards, that the adventure was at the ri&s;k and for the benefit of his wards. But, when the returns were made, and he had doubled the &s;um by the profits of the voyage,&mdash;the gains were, he &s;aid, all his own! &mdash;The fortune of his wards was to an&s;wer for the da|mages, but was not to be at all the better for the ad|vantages! If, in this manner, one is to trade at the peril and lo&s;s of others, and engro&s;s to him&s;elf the whole profits, it is not difficult to conceive how his partners may come to be undone while he enriches him&s;elf.</P>
<P>To lay before you all the particulars which have come to our knowledge of this complicated &s;cene of wickedne&s;s, would but di&s;gu&s;t and &s;hock you. We have witne&s;&s;es h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re to prove what we have alleged again&s;t this cruel invader of the property of helple&s;s innocents,

his own near relations, entru&s;ted to his charge by his decea&s;ed brother.</P>
<P>[The witne&s;&s;es are here examined.]</P>
<P>You have heard, Venerable Judges, the evidence given again&s;t the defendant. He him&s;elf owns the actual re|ceipt of &s;even talents and forty minae of the e&s;tate of the plaintiffs. To &s;ay nothing of what he may have, or rather certainly has gained by the u&s;e of this money; I will allow, what every rea&s;onable per&s;on will judge more than &s;ufficient for the maintenance of three chil|dren, with a governor and maid&mdash;a thou&s;and drachmae a year; which is &s;omething le&s;s than three drachmae a-day. In eight years, this amounts to eight thou&s;and drachmae. So that, upon balancing the account, there remain due to the plaintiffs, of the &s;even talents and forty minae, &s;ix talents and twenty minae: for the de|fendant cannot pretend, that the e&s;tate of the plaintiffs has &s;uffered by fire, by water, or by any other injury than what him&s;elf has done it.</P>

An opinion has long prevailed, not only here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> home but likewi&s;e in foreign countries, both dangerous to you and pernicious to the &s;tate,&mdash;that, in pro&s;ecutions, men of wealth are always &s;afe, however clearly convict|ed. There is now to be brought upon his trial be|fore you, to the confu&s;ion, I hope, of the propagators of this &s;landerous imputation, one who&s;e life and actions condemn him in the opinion of all impartial per&s;ons; but who, according to his own reckoning and declared dependence upon his riches, is already acquitted; I mean Caius Verres. I demand ju&s;tice of you, Fathers, upon the robber of the public trea&s;ury, the oppre&s;&s;or of A&s;ia Minor and Pamphylia, the invader of the rights and privileges of Romans, the &s;courge and cur&s;e of Si|cily. If that &s;entence is pa&s;&s;ed upon him which his crimes de&s;erve, your authority, Fathers, will be vene|rable and &s;acred in the eyes of the public; but if his

great riches &s;hould bias you in his favor, I &s;hall &s;till gain one point,&mdash;to make it apparent to all the world, that what was wanting in this ca&s;e, was not a crimi|nal nor a pro&s;ecutor, but ju&s;tice and adequate puni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>To pa&s;s over the &s;hameful irregularities of his youth, what does his quae&s;tor&s;hip, the fir&s;t public employment he held, what does it exhibit, but one continued &s;cene of villanies? Cneius Carbo plundered of the public money by his own trea&s;urer, a con&s;ul &s;tripped and be|trayed, an army de&s;erted and reduced to want, a pro|vince robbed, the civil and religious rights of a people violated. The employment he held in A&s;ia Minor and Pamphylia, what did it produce but the ruin of tho&s;e countries? in which hou&s;es, cities, and temples, were robbed by him. What was his conduct in his praetor|&s;hip here at home? Let the plundered temples, and public works neglected that he might embezzle the money intended for carrying them on, bear witne&s;s. How did he di&s;charge the office of a judge? Let tho&s;e who &s;uffered by his inju&s;tice an&s;wer. But his praetor|&s;hip in Sicily crowns all his works of wickedne&s;s, and fini&s;hes a la&s;ting monument to his infamy. The mi&s;|chief<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> done by him in that unhappy country, during the three years of his iniquitious admini&s;tration, are &s;uch, that many years under the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of praetors will not be &s;ufficient to re&s;tore things to the condition in which he found them: for it is notorious, that, du|ring the time of his tyranny, the Sicilians neither en|joyed the protection of their own original laws, of the regulations made for their benefit by the Roman &s;enate upon their coming under the protection of the common|wealth, nor of the natural and unalienable rights of men. His nod has decided all cau&s;es in Sicily for the&s;e three years. And his deci&s;ions have broke all law, all precedent, all right. The &s;ums he has, by arbitrary taxes and unheard of impo&s;itions, extorted from the indu&s;trious poor, are not to be computed. The mo&s;t faithful allies of the commonwealth have been treated as enemies. Roman citizens have, like &s;laves, been put to death with tortures. The mo&s;t atrocious criminals, for money, have been exempted from the de&s;erved pu|ni&s;hments;
<PB N="279" REF="021451_0278_0FB3F7A4A4F6EBD0" MS="y">
and men of the mo&s;t unexceptionable cha|racters condemned and bani&s;hed unheard. The har|bors, though &s;ufficiently fortified, and the gates of &s;trong towns, opened to pirates and ravagers. The &s;oldiery and &s;ailors, belonging to a province under the protection of the commonwealth, &s;tarved to death. Whole fleets, to the great detriment of the province. &s;uffered to peri&s;h. The ancient monuments of either Sicilian or Roman greatne&s;s, the &s;tatues of heroes and princes, carried off; and the temples &s;tripped of the images. Having, by his iniquitous &s;entences, filled the pri&s;ons with the mo&s;t indu&s;trious and de&s;erving of the people, he then proceeded to order numbers of Ro|man citizens to be &s;trangled in the goals; &s;o that the exclamation, "I am a citizen of Rome!" which has often, in the mo&s;t di&s;tant regions, and among the mo&s;t barbarous people, been a protection, was of no &s;ervice to them; but, on the contrary, brought a &s;peedier and more &s;evere puni&s;hment upon them.</P>
<P>I a&s;k now, Verres, what you have to advance again&s;t this charge? Will you pretend to deny it? Will you pre|tend, that any thing fal&s;e, that even any thing aggrava|ted, is alleged again&s;t you? Had any prince, or any &s;tate, committed the &s;ame outrage again&s;t the privilege of Ro|man citizens, &s;hould we not think we had &s;ufficient ground for declaring immediate war again&s;t them? What pu|ni&s;hment ought, then, to be inflicted upon a tyrannical and wicked praetor, who dared, at no greater di&s;tance than Sicily, within &s;ight of the Italian coa&s;t, to put to the infamous death of crucifixion that unfortunate and innocent citizen Publius Gavius Co&s;anus, only for his having a&s;&s;erted his privilege of citizen&s;hip, and declared his intention of appealing to the ju&s;tice of his country again&s;t a cruel oppre&s;&s;or, who had unju&s;tly confined him in pri&s;on at Syracu&s;e, whence he had ju&s;t made his e&s;cape? The unhappy man, arre&s;ted as he was going to embark for his native country, is brought before the wicked praetor. With eyes darting fury, and a coun|tenance di&s;torted with cruelty, he orders the helple&s;s victim of his rage to be &s;tripped, and rods to be brought; accu&s;ing him, but without the lea&s;t &s;hadow of evidence, or even of &s;u&s;picions of having come to Sicily as a &s;py.
<PB N="280" REF="021451_0279_0FB3F7A61D6FA500">
It was in vain that the unhappy man cried out, "I am a Roman citizen: I have &s;erved under Lucius Pretius, who is now at Panormus, and will atte&s;t my innocence." The blood-thir&s;ty p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etor, deaf to all he could urge in his own defence, ordered the infamous puni&s;hment to be inflicted. Thus, Fathers, was an innocent Roman citizen publicly mangled with &s;courging; whil&s;t the only words he uttered amid&s;t his cruel &s;ufferings were, "I am a Roman citizen!" With the&s;e he hoped to de|fend him&s;elf from violence and infamy. But of &s;o little &s;ervice was this privilege to him, that while he was thus a&s;&s;erting his citizen&s;hip, the order was given for his execution&mdash;for his execution upon the cro&s;s!&mdash;</P>
<P>O liberty!&mdash;O &s;ound once delightful to every Roman ear!&mdash;O &s;acred privilege of Roman citizen&s;hip!&mdash;once &s;acred!&mdash;now trampled upon!&mdash;But what then! Is it come to this?

Shall neither the cries of innocence expiring in agony, nor the tears of pitying &s;pectators, nor the maje&s;ty of the Roman commonwealth, nor the fear of the ju&s;tice of his country, re&s;train the licentious and wanton cruelty of a mon&s;ter, who, in confidence of his riches, &s;trikes at the root of liberty, and &s;ets mankind at de|fiance?</P>
<P>I conclude with expre&s;&s;ing my hopes, that your wi&s;|dom and ju&s;tice, Fathers, will not, by &s;uffering the atrocious and unexampled in&s;olence of Caius Verres to e&s;cape the due puni&s;hment, leave room to apprehend the danger of a total &s;ubver&s;ion of authority, and in|troduction of general anarchy and confu&s;ion.</P>

oppre&s;&s;ion, and finding the comitia had been delayed &s;o long the year before, that he could not hold this office many months, all on a &s;udden threw up his own year, and re&s;erved him&s;elf to the next; not from any religi|ous &s;cruple, but that he might have, as he &s;aid him&s;elf, a full entire year for exerci&s;ing his praetor&s;hip; that is, for overturning the commonwealth. Being &s;en&s;ible he mu&s;t be controled and cramped in the exerci&s;e of his praetorian authority under Milo, who, he plainly &s;aw, would be cho&s;en con&s;ul by the unanimous con&s;ent of the Roman people; he joined the candidates that oppo&s;ed Milo, but in &s;uch a manner that he overruled them in every thing, had the &s;ole management of the election, and, as he u&s;ed often to boa&s;t, bore all the comitia up|on his own &s;houlders. He a&s;&s;embled the tribes; he thru&s;t him&s;elf into their coun&s;els, and formed a new tribe of the mo&s;t abandoned of the citizens. The more confu|&s;ion and di&s;turbance he made, the more Milo prevailed. When this wretch, who was bent upon all manner of wickedne&s;s, &s;aw that &s;o brave a man, and his mo&s;t in|veterate enemy, would certainly be con&s;ul; when he perceived this, not only by the di&s;cour&s;es, but by the votes of the Roman people, he began to throw of all di&s;gui&s;e, and to declare openly that Milo mu&s;t be kill|ed. He often intimated this in the &s;enate, and decla|red it expre&s;sly before the people; in&s;omuch that when Favonius, that brave man, a&s;ked him what pro&s;pect he could have of carrying on his furious de&s;igns, while Mi|lo was alive? he replied, that in three or four days at mo&s;t he &s;hould be taken out of the way: which reply Favonius immediately communicated to Cato.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as &s;oon as Clodius knew, (nor in|deed was there any difficulty to come at the intelligence) that Milo was obliged by the 18th of January to be at Lanuvium, where he was dictator, in order to nominate a prie&s;t, a duty which the laws rendered nece&s;&s;ary to be performed every year; he went &s;uddenly from Rome the day before, in order, as appears by the event, to way-lay Milo in his own grounds; and this at a time when he was obliged to leave a tumultuous a&s;&s;embly, which he had &s;ummoned that very day, where his pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary to carry on his mad de&s;igns; a thing he never
<PB N="282" REF="021451_0281_0FB3F7A91E4A2680">
would have done, if he had not been de&s;irous to take the advantage of that particular time and place for perpe|trating his villany. But Milo, after having &s;taid in the &s;enate that day till the hou&s;e was broke up, went home, changed his cloaths, waited a while, as u&s;ual, till his wife had got ready to attend him, and then &s;et forward about the time that Clodius, if he had propo&s;ed to come back to Rome that day, might have returned. He meets Clodius near his own e&s;tate, a little before &s;un-&s;et, and is immediately attacked by a body of men, who throw their darts at him from an eminence, and kill his coach|man. Upon which he threw off his cloak, leaped from his chariot, and defended him&s;elf with great bravery. In the mean time Clodius's attendants drawing their &s;words, &s;ome of them ran back to the chariot in order to attack Milo in the rear; whil&s;t others, thinking that he was already killed, fell upon his &s;ervants who were behind: the&s;e being re&s;olute and faithful to their ma&s;ter, were, &s;ome of them, &s;lain; whil&s;t the re&s;t, &s;eeing a warm en|gagement near the chariot, being prevented from going to their ma&s;ter's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, hearing be&s;ides from Clodius him&s;elf that Milo was killed, and believing it to be fact, acted upon this occa&s;ion (I mention it, not with a view to elude the accu&s;ation, but becau&s;e it was the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e) without the orders, without the knowledge, without the pre&s;ence of their ma&s;ter, as every man would wi&s;h his own &s;ervants &s;hould act in the like cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>This, my Lords, is a faithful account of the matter of fact: the per&s;on who lay in wait was him&s;elf over|come, and force &s;ubdued by force, or rather audaciou&s;|ne&s;s cha&s;ti&s;ed by true valor. I &s;ay nothing of the ad|vantage which accrues to the &s;tate in general, to your|&s;elves in particular, and to all good men; I am content to wave the argument I might draw from hence in fa|vor of my client, who&s;e de&s;tiny was &s;o peculiar, that he could not &s;ecure his own &s;afety, without &s;ecuring yours and that of the republic at the &s;ame time. If he could not do it lawfully, there is no room for attempt|ing his defence. But, if rea&s;on teaches the learned, ne|ce&s;&s;ity the barbarian, common cu&s;tom all nations in ge|neral, and even nature it&s;elf in&s;tructs the brutes to de|fend
<PB N="283" REF="021451_0282_0FB3F7AAA3F717A0">
their bodies, limbs, and lives when attacked, by all po&s;&s;ible methods, you cannot pronounce this action cri|minal, without determining at the &s;ame time, that who|ever falls into the hands of a highwayman, mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity peri&s;h either by the &s;word or your deci&s;ions. Had Milo been of this opinion, he would certainly have cho|&s;en to have fallen by the hand of Clodius, who had more than once before this made an attempt upon his life, rather than be executed by your order, becau&s;e he had not tamely yielded him&s;elf a victim to his rage. But if none of you are of this opinion, the proper que&s;tion is, not whether Clodius was killed; for that we grant: but whether ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly? If it appear that Milo was the aggre&s;&s;or, we a&s;k no favor; but if Clodius, you will then acquit him of the crime that has been laid to his charge.</P>
<P>What method then can we take to prove that Clodius lay in wait for Milo? It is &s;ufficient, con&s;idering what an audacious abandoned wretch he was, to &s;how that he lay under a &s;trong temptation to it, that he formed great hopes, and propo&s;ed to him&s;elf great advantages from Milo's death. By Milo's death, Clodius would not only have gained his point of being praetor, without that re&s;traint which his adver&s;ary's power as con&s;ul would have laid upon his wicked de&s;igns, but likewi&s;e that of being praetor under tho&s;e con&s;uls, by who&s;e connivance at lea&s;t, if not a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he hoped he &s;hould be able to betray the &s;tate into the mad &s;chemes he had been form|ing; per&s;uading him&s;elf, that as they thought them|&s;elves under &s;o great an obligation to him, they would have no inclination to oppo&s;e any of his attempts, even if they &s;hould have it in their power; and that, if they were inclined to do it, they would perhaps be &s;carce able to control the mo&s;t profligate of all men, who had been confirmed and hardened in his audaciou&s;ne&s;s by a long &s;eries of villanies.</P>
<P>Milo is &s;o far from receiving any benefit from Clodi|us's death, that he is really a &s;ufferer by it. But it may be &s;aid that hatred prevailed, that anger and re&s;entment urged him on, that he avenged his own wrongs, and re|dre&s;&s;ed his own grievances. Now if all the&s;e particu|lars may be applied not merely with greater propriety
<PB N="284" REF="021451_0283_0FB3F7AC1D88E1F0">
to Clodius than to Milo, but with the utmo&s;t propriety to the one, and not the lea&s;t to the other; what more can you de&s;ire? For why &s;hould Milo bear any other hatred to Clodius, who furni&s;hed him with &s;uch a rich harve&s;t of glory, but that which every patriot mu&s;t bear to all bad men? As to Clodius, he had motives enough for bearing ill-will to Milo; fir&s;t, as my protector and guardian; then as the oppo&s;er of his mad &s;chemes, and the controller of his armed force; and la&s;tly, as his accu&s;er.</P>
<P>Every circum&s;tance, my Lords, concurs to prove that it was for Milo's intere&s;t Clodius &s;hould live; that, on the contrary, Milo's death was a mo&s;t de&s;irable event for an&s;wering the purpo&s;es of Clodius; that on the one &s;ide there was a mo&s;t implacable hatred, on the other not the lea&s;t; that the one had been continually employ|ing him&s;elf in acts of violence, the other only in oppo|&s;ing them; that the life of Milo was threatened, and his death publicly foretold by Clodius, whereas nothing of that kind was ever heard from Milo; that the day fixed for Milo's journey was well known to his adver&s;ary, while Milo knew not when Clodius was to return; that Milo's journey was nece&s;&s;ary, but that of Clodius rather the contrary; that the one openly declared his intention of leaving Rome that day, while the other co|cealed his intention of returning; that Milo made no al|teration in his mea&s;ures, but that Clodius feigned an ex|cu&s;e for altering his; that if Milo had de&s;igned to way-lay Clodius, he would have waited for him near the city till it was dark, but that Clodius, even if he had been under no apprehen&s;ions from Milo, ought to have been afraid of coming to town &s;o late at night.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider whether the place where they encountered was mo&s;t favourable to Milo or to Clodius. But can there, my Lords, be any room for doubt, or de|liberation upon that? It was near the e&s;tate of Clodius, where at lea&s;t a thou&s;and able-bodied men were employ|ed in his mad &s;chemes of building. Did Milo think he &s;hould have an advantage by attacking him from an e|minence, and did he for this rea&s;on pitch upon that &s;pot for the engagement; or was he not rather expected in that place by his adver&s;ary, who hoped the &s;ituation
<PB N="285" REF="021451_0284_0FB3F7AD9F06E2E8">
would favor his a&s;&s;ault? The thing, my Lords, &s;peaks for it&s;elf, which mu&s;t be allowed to be of the greate&s;t importance in determining a que&s;tion. Were the affair to be repre&s;ented only by painting, in&s;tead of being ex|pre&s;&s;ed by words, it would even then clearly appear which was the traitor, and which was free from all mi&s;chievous de&s;igns; when the one was &s;itting in his chariot muffled up in his cloak, and his wife along with him. Which of the&s;e circum&s;tances was not a very great incumbrance? the dre&s;s, the chariot, or the companion? How could he be wor&s;e equipped for an engagement, when he was wrapt up in a cloak, embarra&s;&s;ed with a chariot, and almo&s;t fettered by his wife? Ob&s;erve the other now, in the fir&s;t place, &s;allying out on a &s;udden from his &s;eat; for what rea&s;on? in the evening; what urged him? late; to what purpo&s;e, e&s;pecially at that &s;ea&s;on? He calls at Pompey's &s;eat; with what view? To &s;ee Pompey? He knew he was at Al&s;ium. To &s;ee his hou&s;e? He had been in it a thou&s;and times. What then could be the rea&s;on of this loitering and &s;hifting about? He wanted to be upon the &s;pot when Milo came up.</P>
<P>But if, my Lords, you are not yet convinced, though the thing &s;hines out with &s;uch &s;trong and full evidence, that Milo returned to Rome with an innocent mind, un|&s;tained with guilt, undi&s;turbed by fear, and free from the accu&s;ations of con&s;cience; call to mind, I be&s;eech you by the immortal gods, the expedition with which he came back, his entrance into the forum while the &s;e|nate-hou&s;e was in flames, the greatne&s;s of &s;oul he di&s;co|vered, the look he a&s;&s;umed, the &s;peech he made on the occa&s;ion. He delivered him&s;elf up, not only to the peo|ple, but even to the &s;enate; nor to the &s;enate alone, but even to guards appointed for the public &s;ecurity; nor merely to them, but even to the authority of him whom the &s;enate had intru&s;ted with the care of the whole republic: to whom he would never have deliver|ed him&s;elf, if he had not been confident of the goodne&s;s of his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>What now remains, but to be&s;eech and adjure you, my Lords, to extend that compa&s;&s;ion to a brave man, which he di&s;dains to implore, but which I, even again&s;t his con&s;ent, implore and earne&s;tly intreat. Though you
<PB N="286" REF="021451_0285_0FB3F7AF1C9BAF48">
have not &s;een him &s;hed a &s;ingle tear while all are weep|ing around him, though he has pre&s;erved the &s;ame &s;teady countenance, the &s;ame firmne&s;s of voice and language, do not on this account withhold it from him.</P>
<P>On you, on you I call, ye heroes, who have lo&s;t &s;o much blood in the &s;ervice of your country! to you, ye centurions, ye &s;oldiers, I appeal in this hour of danger to the be&s;t of men, and brave&s;t of citizens! while you are looking on, while you &s;tand here with arms in your hands, and guard this tribunal, &s;hall virtue like this be expelled, exterminated, ca&s;t out with di&s;honor? By the immortal gods I wi&s;h (pardon me, O my coun|try! for I fear what I &s;hall &s;ay out of a pious regard for Milo may be deemed impiety again&s;t thee,) that Clodius not only lived, but were praetor, con&s;ul, dictator, rather than be witne&s;s to &s;uch a &s;cene as this. Shall this man, then, who was born to &s;ave his country, die any where but in his country? Shall he not at lea&s;t die in the &s;er|vice of his country? Will you retain the memorials of his gallant &s;oul, and deny his body a grave in Italy? Will any per&s;on give his voice for bani&s;hing a man from this city, whom every city on earth would be proud to receive within its walls? Happy the country that &s;hall receive him! ungrateful this, if it &s;hall bani&s;h him! wretched, if it &s;hould lo&s;e him! But I mu&s;t conclude; my tears will not allow me to proceed, and Milo for|bids tears to be employed in his defence. You, my Lords, I be&s;eech and adjure, that, in your deci&s;ion you would dare to act as you think. Tru&s;t me, your forti|tude, your ju&s;tice, your fidelity, will more e&s;pecially be approved of by him (Pompey,) who in his choice of judges has rai&s;ed to the bench the brave&s;t, the wi&s;e&s;t, and the be&s;t of men.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. SPEECHES DELIVERED ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I. CAIUS MARIUS to the ROMANS; &s;howing the Ab|&s;urdity of their he&s;itating to confer on him the RANK of GENERAL merely on ACCOUNT of his EXTRACTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is but too common, my Countrymen, to ob&s;erve a material difference between the behavior of tho&s;e who &s;tand candidates for places of power and tru&s;t, be|fore and after their obtaining them. They &s;olicit them in one manner, and execute them in another. They &s;et out with a great appearance of activity, humility, and moderation; and they quickly fall into &s;loth, pride, and avarice.&mdash;It is, undoubtedly, no ea&s;y matter to di&s;|charge, to the general &s;atisfaction, the duty of a &s;upreme commander in trouble&s;ome times. To carry on, with effect, an expen&s;ive war, and yet be frugal of the pub|lic money; to oblige tho&s;e to &s;erve, whom it may be delicate to offend; to conduct, at the &s;ame time, a com|plicated variety of operations; to concert mea&s;ures at home, an&s;werable to the &s;tate of things abroad; and to gain every valuable end, in &s;pite of oppo&s;ition from the envious, the factious, and the di&s;affected&mdash;to do all this, my countrymen, is more difficult than is generally thought.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides the di&s;advantages which are common to me with all others in eminent &s;tations, my ca&s;e is, in this re&s;pect, peculiarly hard&mdash;that, whereas a command|der of Patrician rank, if he is guilty of a neglect or breach of duty, has his great connections, the antiquity of his family, the important &s;ervices of his ance&s;tors, and the multitudes he has, by power, engaged in his intere&s;t, to &s;creen him from condign puni&s;hment, my whole &s;afety depends upon my&s;elf; which renders it the more indi&s;pen|&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for me to take care that my conduct be
<PB N="288" REF="021451_0287_0FB3F7B21EEF8A58">
clear and unexceptionable. Be&s;ides, I am well aware, my Countrymen, that the eye of the public is upon me; and that, though the impartial, who prefer the real ad|vantage of the commonwealth to all other con&s;iderations, favor my preten&s;ions, the Partricians want nothing &s;o much as an occa&s;ion again&s;t me. It is, therefore, my fixed re&s;olution, to u&s;e my be&s;t endeavors, that you be not di&s;appointed in me, and that their indirect de&s;igns again&s;t me may be defeated.</P>
<P>I have, from my youth, been familiar with toils and with dangers. I was faithful to your intere&s;t, my coun|trymen, when I &s;erved you for no reward but that of honor. It is not my de&s;ign to betray you, now that you have conferred upon me a place of profit. You have committed to my conduct the war again&s;t Jugur|tha. The Patricians are offended at this. But, where would be the wi&s;dom of giving &s;uch a command to one of their honorable body? a per&s;on of illu&s;trious birth, of ancient family, of innumerable &s;tatues, but&mdash;of no experience! What &s;ervice would his long line of dead ance&s;tors, or his multitude of motionle&s;s &s;tatues, do his country in the day of battle? What could &s;uch a gene|ral do, but, in his trepidation and inexperience, have re|cour&s;e to &s;ome inferior commander for direction in diffi|culties to which he was not him&s;elf equal? Thus, your Patrician general would in fact have a general over him; &s;o that the acting commander would &s;till be a Plebeian. So true is this, my Countrymen, that I have, my&s;elf, known tho&s;e who have been cho&s;en con&s;uls, begin then to read the hi&s;tory of their own country, of which, till that time, they were totally ignorant; that is, they fir&s;t obtained the employment, and then bethought them|&s;elves of the qualifications nece&s;&s;ary for the proper di&s;|charge of it.</P>
<P>I &s;ubmit to your judgment, Romans, on which &s;ide the advantage lies, when a compari&s;on is made between Patrician haughtine&s;s and Plebeian experience. The very actions, which they have only read, I have partly &s;een, and partly my&s;elf atchieved. What they know by reading, I know by action. They are plea&s;ed to &s;light my mean birth: I de&s;pi&s;e their mean characters. Want of birth and fortune is the objection again&s;t me; want
<PB N="289" REF="021451_0288_0FB3F7B39C7CC538">
of per&s;onal worth, again&s;t them. But are not all men of the &s;ame &s;pecies? What can make a difference be|tween one man and another, but the endowments of the mind? For my part, I &s;hall always look upon the bra|ve&s;t man as the noble&s;t man. Suppo&s;e it were enquired of the fathers of &s;uch Patricians as Albinus and Be&s;tia, whether, if they had their choice, they would de&s;ire &s;ons of their character, or of mine: what would they an&s;wer, but that they &s;hould wi&s;h the worthie&s;t to be their &s;ons? If the Patricians have rea&s;on to de&s;pi&s;e me, let them likewi&s;e de&s;pi&s;e their ance&s;tors, who&s;e nobility was the fruit of their virtue. Do they envy the honors be&s;tow|ed upon me? let them envy, likewi&s;e, my labors, my ab&s;tinence, and the dangers I have undergone for my country, by which I have acquired them. But tho&s;e worthle&s;s men lead &s;uch a life of inactivity, as if they de&s;pi&s;ed any honors you can be&s;tow; whil&s;t they a&s;pire to honors, as if they had de&s;erved them by the mo&s;t indu&s;trious virtue. They lay claim to the rewards of activity, for their having enjoyed the plea&s;ures of lux|ury. Yet none can be more lavi&s;h than they are in prai&s;e of their ance&s;tors. And they imagine they ho|nor them&s;elves by celebrating their forefathers; where|as they do the very contrary: for, as much as their an|ce&s;tors were di&s;tingui&s;hed for their virtues, &s;o much are they di&s;graced by their vices. The glory of ance&s;tors ca&s;ts a light, indeed, upon their po&s;terity; but it only &s;erves to &s;how what the de&s;cendants are. It alike exhi|bits to public view their degeneracy and their worth. I own I cannot boa&s;t of the deeds of my forefathers; but I hope I may an&s;wer the cavils of the Patricians by &s;tanding up in defence of what I have my&s;elf done.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve now, my Countrymen, the inju&s;tice of the Patricians. They arrogate to them&s;elves honors on account of the exploits done by their forefathers, whil&s;t they will not allow me the due prai&s;e for performing the very &s;ame &s;ort of actions in my own per&s;on. He has no &s;tatues, they cry of his family. He can trace no venerable line of ance&s;tors.&mdash;What then? Is it matter of more prai&s;e to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">grace one's illu&s;trious ance&s;tors, than to become illu&s;trious by one's own good behavior?

the &s;tandards, the armor, and the trappings, which I have my&s;elf taken from the vanqui&s;hed: I can &s;how the &s;cars of tho&s;e wounds, which I have received by facing the enemies of my country. The&s;e are my &s;tatues. The&s;e are the honors I boa&s;t of. Not left me by in|heritance, as theirs; but earned by toil, by ab&s;tinence, by valor; amid&s;t clouds of du&s;t and &s;eas of blood: &s;cenes of action, where tho&s;e effeminate Patricians, who endeavor by indirect means to depreciate me in your e&s;teem, have never dared to &s;how their faces.</P>

<HEAD>II. SPEECH of PUBLIUS SCIPIO to the ROMAN AR|MY before the Battle of the TICIN.</HEAD>
<P>WERE you, Soldiers, the &s;ame army which I had with me in Gaul, I might well forbear &s;aying any thing to you at this time: for what occa&s;ion could there be to u&s;e exhortation to a cavalry that had &s;o &s;ignally vanqui&s;hed the &s;quadrons of the enemy upon the Rhone; or to legions, by whom that &s;ame enemy, flying before them to avoid a battle, did in effect confe&s;s them&s;elves conquered? but as the&s;e troops, having been enrolled for Spain, are there with my brother <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">neius, making war under my au&s;pices (as was the will of the &s;enate and people of Rome,) I, that you might have a con&s;ul for your captain again&s;t Hannibal and the Carthaginians, have freely offered my&s;elf for this war. You, then, have a new general, and I a new army. On this account, a few words from me to you will be neither improper nor un&s;ea&s;onable.</P>
<P>That you may not be unappri&s;ed of what &s;ort of enemies you are going to encounter, or of what is to be feared from them, they are the very &s;ame, whom, in a former war, you vanqui&s;hed both by land and &s;ea; the &s;ame from whom you took Sicily and Sardinia, and who have been the&s;e twenty years your tributaries. You will not, I pre&s;ume, march again&s;t the&s;e men with only that courage with which you are wont to face other ene|mies: but with a certain anger and indignation, &s;uch as you would feel if you &s;aw your &s;laves on a &s;udden ri&s;e up in arms again&s;t you. Conquered and en&s;laved, it is not boldne&s;s, but nece&s;&s;ity, that urges them to battle; unle&s;s you can believe that tho&s;e who avoided fighting
<PB N="291" REF="021451_0290_0FB3F7B69CF0F750">
when their army was entire, have acquired better hope by the lo&s;s of two-thirds of their hor&s;e and foot in the pa&s;&s;age of the Alps.</P>
<P>But you have heard, perhaps, that, though they are few in number, they are men of &s;tout hearts and robu&s;t bodies; heroes of &s;uch &s;trength and vigor as nothing is able to re&s;i&s;t.&mdash;Mere effigies! nay, &s;hadows of men! wretches, emaciated with hunger, and benumbed with cold! brui&s;ed and battered to pieces among the rocks and craggy cliffs! their weapons broken, and their hor&s;es weak and foundered! Such are the cavalry, and &s;uch the infantry, with which you are going to contend; not enemies, but the fragments of enemies. There is nothing which I more apprehend, than that it will be thought Hannibal was vanqui&s;hed by the Alps before we had any conflict with him. But, perhaps, it was fitting it &s;hould be &s;o; and that, with a people and a leader who had violated leagues and covenants, the gods them&s;elves, without man's help, &s;hould begin the war, and bring it to a near conclu&s;ion; and that we, who, next to the gods, have been injured and offended, &s;hould happily fini&s;h what they have begun.</P>
<P>I need not be in any fear that you &s;hould &s;u&s;pect me of &s;aying the&s;e things merely to encourage you, while inwardly I have different &s;entiments. What hindered me from going into Spain? That was my province, where I &s;hould have had the le&s;s dreaded A&s;drubal, not Hannibal, to deal with. But, hearing, as I pa&s;&s;ed along the coa&s;t of Gaul, of this enemy's march, I landed my troops, &s;ent the hor&s;e forward, and pitched my camp upon the Rhone. A part of my cavalry encountered, and defeated that of the enemy. My infantry not being able to overtake theirs, which fled before us, I returned to my fleet; and, with all the expedition I could u&s;e in &s;o long a voyage by &s;ea and land, am come to meet them at the foot of the Alps. Was it, then, my inclination to avoid a conte&s;t with this tremendous Hannibal? and have I met with him only by accident and unawares? or am I come on purpo&s;e to challenge him to the combat? I would gladly try, whether the earth, within the&s;e twenty years, has brought forth a new kind of Cartha|ginians; or whether they be the &s;ame &s;ort of men who
<PB N="292" REF="021451_0291_0FB3F7B81D7D6488">
fought at the Aegates, and whom, at Eryx, you &s;uffered to redeem them&s;elves at eighteen denarii per head: whether this Hannibal, for labors and journeys, be, as he would be thought, the rival of Hercules; or whe|ther he be, what his father left him, a tributary, a va&s;|&s;al, a &s;lave of the Roman people. Did not the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his wicked deed at Saguntum torment him and make him de&s;perate, he would have &s;ome regard, if not to his conquered country, yet &s;urely to his own fa|mily, to his father's memory, to the treaty written with Amilcar's own hand. We might have &s;tarved him in Eryx; we might have pa&s;&s;ed into Africa with our victo|rious fleet, and, in a few days, have de&s;troyed Car|thage. At their humble &s;upplication, we pardoned them; we relea&s;ed them, when they were clo&s;ely &s;hut up without a po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping; we made peace with them when they were conquered. When they were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the African war, we con&s;idered them, we treated them, as a people under our protection. And what is the return they make us for all the&s;e favors? Under the conduct of a hair-brained young man, they come hither to overturn our &s;tate, and lay wa&s;te our coun|try.&mdash;I could wi&s;h, indeed, that it were not &s;o; and that the war we are now engaged in concerned only our own glory, and not our pre&s;ervation. But the conte&s;t at pre|&s;ent is not for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sicily and Sardinia, but of Italy it&s;elf: nor is there behind us another army, which, if we &s;hould not prove the conquerors, may make head again&s;t our victorious enemies. There are no more Alps for them to pa&s;s, which might give us lei&s;ure to rai&s;e new forces. No, Soldiers; here you mu&s;t make your &s;tand, as if you were ju&s;t now before the walls of Rome. Let every one refle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, that he is now to defend, not his own per&s;on only, but his wife, his children, his helple&s;s infants. Yet, let not private con&s;iderations alone po&s;&s;e&s;s our minds: let us remember that the eyes of the &s;enate and people of Rome are upon us; and that as our force and courage &s;hall now prove, &s;uch will be the fortune of that city and of the Roman empire.</P>

<HEAD>III. SPEECH of HANNIBAL to the CARTHAGINIAN AR|MY, on the &s;ame OCCASION.</HEAD>
<P>I KNOW not, Soldiers, whether you or your pri&s;oners be encompa&s;&s;ed by fortune with the &s;tricter bonds and nece&s;&s;ities. Two &s;eas enclo&s;e you on the right and left; not a &s;hip to fly to for e&s;caping. Before you is the Po, a river broader and more rapid than the Rhone: behind you are the Alps; over which, even when your numbers were undimini&s;hed, you were hardly able to force a pa&s;&s;age. Here, then, Soldiers, you mu&s;t ei|ther conquer or die the very fir&s;t hour you meet the enemy.</P>
<P>But the &s;ame fortune which has thus laid you under the nece&s;&s;ity of fighting, has &s;et before your eyes the mo&s;t glorious rewards of victory. Should we, by our valor, recover only Sicily and Sardinia, which were ravi&s;hed from our fathers, tho&s;e would be no incon&s;ider|able prizes. Yet, what are tho&s;e? The wealth of Rome; whatever riches &s;he has heaped together in the &s;poils of nations; all the&s;e with the ma&s;ters of them, will be yours. The time is now come to reap the full recompen&s;e of your toil&s;ome marches, over &s;o many mountains and ri|vers, and through &s;o many nations, all of them in arms. This is the place which Fortune has appointed to be the limits of your labor; it is here that you will fini&s;h your glorious warfare, and receive an ample recompen&s;e of your completed &s;ervice. For I would not have you imagine, that victory will be as difficult as the name of a Roman war is great and &s;ounding. It has often happened that a de&s;pi&s;ed enemy has given a bloody battle; and the mo&s;t renowned kings and nations have by a &s;mall force been overthrown. And, if you but take away the glitter of the Roman name, what is there wherein they may &s;tand in competition with you? For (to &s;ay nothing of your &s;ervice in war, for twenty years together, with &s;o much valor and &s;ucce&s;s) from the very pillars of Hercules, from the ocean, from the ut|mo&s;t bounds of the earth, through &s;o many warlike na|tions of Spain and Gaul, are you not come hither vic|torious? And with whom have you now to fight? With raw &s;oldiers, an undi&s;ciplined army, beaten, vanqui&s;h|ed
<PB N="294" REF="021451_0293_0FB3F7BB1D5811D8">
be&s;ieged by the Gauls the very la&s;t &s;ummer; an army unknown to their leader, and unacquainted with him.</P>
<P>Or &s;hall I, who was born, I might almo&s;t &s;ay, but certainly brought up, in the tent of my father, that mo&s;t excellent general; &s;hall I, the conqueror of Spain and Gaul, and not only of the Alpine nations, but, which is greater &s;till, of the Alps them&s;elves; &s;hall I compare my&s;elf with this half-year captain? a captain, before whom &s;hould one place the two armies without their en&s;igns, I am per&s;uaded he would not know to which of them he is con&s;ul. I e&s;teem it no &s;mall advantage, Sol|diers, that there is not one among you, who has not often been an eye-witne&s;s of my exploits in war: not one, of who&s;e valor I my&s;elf have not been a &s;pectator, &s;o as to be able to name the times and places of his noble achieve|ments; that with &s;oldiers, whom I have a thou&s;and times prai&s;ed and rewarded, and who&s;e pupil I was be|fore I became their general, I &s;hall march again&s;t an ar|my of men &s;trangers to one another.</P>
<P>On what &s;ide &s;oever I turn my eyes, I behold all full of courage and &s;trength. A veteran infantry; a mo&s;t gallant cavalry; you, my Allies, mo&s;t faithful and val|liant; you, Carthaginians, whom not only your coun|try's cau&s;e, but the ju&s;te&s;t anger, impels to battle. The hope, the courage of a&s;&s;ailants, is always greater than of tho&s;e who act upon the defen&s;ive. With ho&s;tile ban|ners di&s;played, you are come down upon Italy: you bring the war. Grief, injuries, indignities, fire your minds, and &s;pur you forward to revenge.&mdash;Fir&s;t, they demanded me, that I, your general, &s;hould be delivered up to them; next, all of you who had fought at the &s;iege of Saguntum: and we were to be put to death by the extreme&s;t tortures. Proud and cruel nation! Every thing mu&s;t be yours, and at your di&s;po&s;al? You are to pre&s;cribe to us with whom we &s;hall make war, with whom &s;hall we make peace? You are to &s;et us bounds; to &s;hut us up within hills and rivers; but you are not to ob&s;erve the limits which your&s;elves have fixed! "Pa&s;s not the Iberus." What next? "Touch not the Sa|guntines; Saguntum is upon the Iberus, move not a &s;tep towards that city." Is it a &s;mall matter, then, that
<PB N="295" REF="021451_0294_0FB3F7BE21630EE0">
you have deprived us of our ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, Sicily and Sardinia? you would have Spain too. Well; we &s;hall yield Spain, and then&mdash;you will pa&s;s into Africa.&mdash; Will pa&s;s, did I &s;ay?&mdash;this very year they ordered one of their con&s;uls into Africa, the other into Spain. No, Soldiers; there is nothing left for us but what we can vindicate with our &s;words. Come on, then. Be men. The Romans may, with more &s;afety, be cowards: they have their own country behind them, have places of re|fuge to fly to, and are &s;ecure from danger in the roads thither; but, for you, there is no middle fortune between death and victory. Let this be but well fixed in your minds; and, once again, I &s;ay you are conquerors.</P>

<HEAD>IV. Speech of ADHERBAL to the Roman Senate, im|ploring their A&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t JUGURTHA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FATHERS!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is known to you, that king Micip&s;a, my father, on his deathbed, left in charge to Jugurtha, his adopted &s;on, conjunctly with my unfortunate brother Hiemp&s;al, and my&s;elf, the children of his own body, the admini&s;|tration of the kingdom of Numidia, directing us to con&s;i|der the &s;enate and people of Rome as proprietors of it. He charged us to u&s;e our be&s;t endeavors to be &s;ervicea|ble to the Roman commonwealth, in peace and war; a&s;&s;uring us, that your protection would prove to us a de|fence again&s;t all enemies, and would be in&s;tead of ar|mies, fortifications, and trea&s;ures.</P>
<P>While my brother and I were thinking of nothing but how to regulate our&s;elves according to the direc|tions of our decea&s;ed father&mdash;Jugurtha&mdash;the mo&s;t infa|mous of mankind!&mdash;breaking through all ties of gra|titude and of common humanity, and trampling on the authority of the Roman commonwealth, procured the murder of my unfortunate brother, and has driven me from my throne and native country, though he knows I inherit, from my grandfather Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a, and my fa|ther Micip&s;a, the friend&s;hip and alliance of the Ro|mans.</P>
<P>For a prince to be reduced, by villany, to my di|&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tances, is calamity enough; but my misfortunes are heightened by the con&s;ideration that I
<PB N="296" REF="021451_0295_0FB3F7C024B70088">
find my&s;elf obliged to &s;olicit your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, Fathers, for the &s;ervices done you by my ance&s;tors, not for any I have been able to render you in my own per&s;on. Ju|gurtha has put it out of my power to de&s;erve any thing at your hands; and has forced me to be burden&s;ome, before I could be u&s;eful to you. And yet, if I had no plea, but my unde&s;erved mi&s;ery&mdash;a once powerful prince, the de&s;cendant of a race of illu&s;trious monarchs, now, without any fault of my own, de&s;titute of every &s;up|port and reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of begging foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, again&s;t an enemy who has &s;eized my throne and my kingdom&mdash;if my unequalled di&s;tre&s;&s;es were all I had to plead&mdash;it would become the greatne&s;s of the Roman commonwealth, the arbitre&s;s of the world, to protect the injured, and to check the triumph of daring wickedne&s;s over helple&s;s innocence.&mdash;But, to provoke your vengeance to the utmo&s;t, Jugurtha has driven me from the very dominions, which the &s;enate and people of Rome gave to my ance&s;tors: and, from which, my grandfather, and my father, under your umbrage, ex|pelled Syphax and the Carthaginians. Thus, Fathers, your kindne&s;s to our family is defeated; and Jugurtha, in injuring me, throws contempt on you.</P>
<P>Oh wretched prince! Oh cruel rever&s;e of fortune! Oh father Micip&s;a! is this the con&s;equence of your gene|ro&s;ity; that he, whom your goodne&s;s rai&s;ed to an equa|lity with your own chidren, &s;hould be the murderer of your children? Mu&s;t, then, the royal hou&s;e of Nu|midia always be a &s;cene of havoc and blood? While Carthage remained, we &s;uffered, as was to be expected, all &s;orts of hard&s;hips from their ho&s;tile attacks: our enemy near: our only powerful ally, the Roman com|monwealth, at a di&s;tance. While we were &s;o circum|&s;tanced, we were always in arms, and in action. When that &s;courge of Africa was no more, we congratulated our&s;elves on the pro&s;pect of e&s;tabli&s;hed peace. But, in&s;tead of peace, behold the kingdom of Numidia drenched with royal blood! and the only &s;urviving &s;on of its late king, flying from an adopted murderer, and &s;eeking that &s;afety in foreign parts which he cannot command in his own kingdom.</P>
<P>Whither&mdash;Oh! whither &s;hall I fly? If I return to
<PB N="297" REF="021451_0296_0FB3F7C11DB4E390">
the royal palace of my ance&s;tors, my father's throne is &s;eized by the murderer of my brother. What can I there expect, but that Jugurtha &s;hould ha&s;ten to im|brue, in my blood, tho&s;e hands which are now reek|ing with my brother's? If I were to fly for refuge, or for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to any other court; from what prince can I hope for protection, if the Roman commonwealth gives me up? From my own family or friends I have no expectations. My royal father is no more. He is beyond the reach of violence, and out of hearing of the complaints of his unhappy &s;on. Were my brother alive, our mutual &s;ympathy would be &s;ome alleviation. But he is hurried out of life, in his early youth, by the very hand which &s;hould have been the la&s;t to injure any of the royal family of Numidia. The bloody Ju|gurtha has butchered all whom he &s;u&s;pected to be in my intere&s;t. Some have been de&s;troyed by the linger|ing torment of the cro&s;s. Others have been given a prey to wild bea&s;ts, and their angui&s;h made the &s;port of men more cruel than wild bea&s;ts. If there be any yet alive, they are &s;hut up in dungeons, there to drag out a life more intolerable than death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Look down, illu&s;trious &s;enators of Rome! from that height of power to which you are rai&s;ed, on the unex|ampled di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a prince, who is, by the cruelty of a wicked intruder, become an outca&s;t from all mankind. Let not the crafty in&s;inuations of him who returns murder for adoption, prejudice your judgment. Do not li&s;ten to the wretch who has butchered the &s;on and relations of a king, who gave him power to &s;it on the &s;ame throne with his own &s;ons.&mdash;I have been informed, that he labors by his emi&s;&s;aries to prevent your deter|mining any thing again&s;t him in his ab&s;ence; pretending that I magnify my di&s;tre&s;s, and might for him have &s;taid in peace in my own kingdom. But if ever the time comes when the due vengeance from above &s;hall overtake him, he will then di&s;&s;emble as I do. Then he, who now, hardened in wickedne&s;s, triumphs over tho&s;e whom his violence has laid low, will, in his turn, feel di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;uffer for his impious ingrati|tude to my father, and his blood-thir&s;ty cruelty to my brother.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="021451_0297_0FB3F7C29D67C948">Oh murdered butchered brother! Oh deare&s;t to my heart&mdash;now gone for ever from my &s;ight!&mdash;But, why &s;hould I lament his death? He is, indeed, deprived of the ble&s;&s;ed light of heaven, of life, and kingdom, at once, by the very per&s;on who ought to have been the fir&s;t to hazard his own life in defence of any one of Micip&s;a's family: but, as things are, my brother is not &s;o much deprived of the&s;e comforts, as delivered from terror, from flight, from exile, and the endle&s;s train of mi&s;eries which render life to me a burden. He lies full low, gored with wounds, and fe&s;tering in his own blood. But he lies in peace. He feels none of the mi&s;eries which rend my &s;oul with agony and di&s;trac|tion, while I am &s;et up a &s;pectacle to all mankind of the uncertainty of human affairs. So far from having it in my power to revenge his death, I am not ma&s;ter of the means of &s;ecuring my own life. So far from being in a condition to defend my kingdom from the violence of the u&s;urper, I am obliged to apply for fo|reign protection for my own per&s;on.</P>

<P>WHAT an in&s;ult upon us is this! If we are not &s;o rich as the Patricians, are we not citizens of Rome as well as they? inhabitants of the &s;ame country? mem|bers of the &s;ame community? The nations bordering up|on Rome, and even &s;trangers more remote, are admit|ted, not only to marriages with us, but to what is of much greater importance, the freedom of the city. Are

the decemvirs enacted it? and a mo&s;t &s;hameful one it is in a free &s;tate. Such marriages, it &s;eems, will taint the pure blood of the nobility! Why, if they think &s;o, let them take care to match their &s;i&s;ters and daughters with men of their own &s;ort. No Plebeian will do violence to the daughter of a Patrician. Tho&s;e are exploits for our prime nobles. There is no need to fear that we &s;hall force any body into a contract of marriage. But, to make an expre&s;s law to prohibit marriages of Patrici|ans with Plebeians, what is this but to &s;how the utmo&s;t contempt of us, and to declare one part of community to be impure and unclean?</P>
<P>They talk to us of the confu&s;ion there will be in fa|milies if this &s;tatute &s;hould be repealed. I wonder they don't make a law again&s;t a commoner's living near a nobleman, or going the &s;ame road that he is going, or being pre&s;ent at the &s;ame fea&s;t, or appearing in the &s;ame market-place. They might as well pretend that the&s;e things make confu&s;ion in families, as that intermarriages will do it. Does not every one know, that the chil|dren will be ranked according to the quality of their fa|ther, let him be a Patrician or a Plebeian? In &s;hort, it is manife&s;t enough that we have nothing in view but to be treated as men and citizens; nor can they who op|po&s;e our demand have any motive to do it but the love of domineering. I would fain know of you, Con&s;uls and Patricians, is the &s;overeign power in the people of Rome, or in you? I hope you will allow, that the people can, at their plea&s;ure, either make a law or repeal one. And will you, then, as &s;oon as any law is propo&s;ed to them, pretend to li&s;t them immediately for the war, and hin|der them from giving their &s;uffrages by leading them into the field?</P>
<P>Hear me, con&s;uls. Whether the news of the war you talk of be true, or whether it be only a fal&s;e rumor &s;pread abroad for nothing but a color to &s;end the peo|ple out of the city, I declare, as tribune, that this peo|ple who have already &s;o often &s;pilt their blood in our country's cau&s;e, are again ready to arm for its defence and its glory, if they may be re&s;tored to their natural rights, and you will no longer treat us like &s;trangers in our own country: but, if you account us unworthy of

we, becau&s;e we are commoners, to be treated wor&s;e than &s;trangers? And, when we demand that the people may be free to be&s;tow their offices and dignities on whom they plea&s;e, do we a&s;k any thing unrea&s;onable or new? Do we claim more than their original inherent right? What occa&s;ion, then, for all this uproar, as if the uni|ver&s;e were falling to ruin? They were ju&s;t going to lay violent hands upon me in the &s;enate-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>What! mu&s;t this empire, then, be unavoidably over|turned: mu&s;t Rome of nece&s;&s;ity &s;ink at once, if a Ple|beian, worthy of the office, &s;hould be rai&s;ed to the con|&s;ul&s;hip? The Patricians, I am per&s;uaded, if they could, would deprive you of the common light. It certainly offends them that you breathe, that you &s;peak, that you have the &s;hapes of men. Nay, but to make a commoner a con&s;ul, would be, &s;ay they, a mo&s;t enormous thing. Numa Pompilius, however, without being &s;o much as a Roman citizen, was made king of Rome. The elder Tarquin, by birth not even an Italian, was neverthele&s;s placed upon the throne. Servius Tullius, the &s;on of a captive woman (nobody knows who his father was), obtained the kingdom as the reward of his wi&s;dom and virtue. In tho&s;e days, no man in whom virtue &s;hone con&s;picuous was rejected or de&s;pi&s;ed on account of his race and de&s;cent. And did the &s;tate pro&s;per the le&s;s for that? Were not the&s;e &s;trangers of the very be&s;t of all our kings? and &s;uppo&s;ing, now, that a Plebeian &s;hould have their talents and merit, mu&s;t not he be &s;uffered to govern us.</P>
<P>But, "we find, that, upon the abolition of the regal power, no commoner was cho&s;en to the con&s;ulate." And what of that? Before Numa's time, there were no pontiffs in Rome. Before Servius Tullius's days, there were no cen&s;us, no divi&s;ion of people into cla&s;&s;es and centuries. Who ever heard of con&s;uls, before the ex|pul&s;ion of Tarquin the Proud? Dictators, we all know, are of modern invention; and &s;o are the offices of tri|bunes, aediles, quae&s;tors. Within the&s;e ten years we have made decemvirs, and we have unmade them. Is nothing to be done but what has been done before? That very law forbidding marriages of Patricians with Plebeians, is not that a new thing? Was there any &s;uch law before

<P>YES, noble lady, I &s;wear by this blood, which was once &s;o pure, and which nothing but royal villany could have polluted, that I will pur&s;ue Lucius Tarqui|nius the Proud, his wicked wife, and their children, with fire and &s;word; nor will I ever &s;uffer any of that family, or of any other what&s;oever, to be king in Rome: Ye gods, I call you to witne&s;s this my oath!&mdash;There, Ro|mans, turn your eyes to that &s;ad &s;pectacle&mdash;the daugh|ter of Lucretius, Collatinus's wife&mdash;&s;he died by her own hand.

Ho&s;pitably entertained by her as a kin&s;man of her hu&s;band's, Sextus, the per|fidious gue&s;t, became her brutal ravi&s;her. The cha&s;te, the generous Lucretia, could not &s;urvive the in&s;ult. Glori|ous woman! But once only treated as a &s;lave, &s;he thought life no longer to be endured.

provided with men, arms, and all things nece&s;&s;ary. There is nothing wanting to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;s, if our own courage does not fail us. And &s;hall tho&s;e warriors, who have ever been &s;o brave when foreign enemies were to be &s;ubdued, or when conque&s;ts were to be made to gratify the ambition and avarice of Tarquin, be then only cowards, when they are to deliver them&s;elves from &s;lavery?&mdash;Some of you are perhaps intimidated by the army which Tarquin now commands. The &s;oldiers, you imagine, will take the part of their general. Bani&s;h &s;o groundle&s;s a fear. The love of liberty is natural to all men. Your fellow-citizens in the camp feel the weight of oppre&s;&s;ion with as quick a &s;en&s;e as you that are in Rome: they will as eagerly &s;eize the occa&s;ion of throw|ing off the yoke. But, let us grant there may be &s;ome among them, who, through ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;pirit or a bad education, will be di&s;po&s;ed to favor the tyrant. The number of the&s;e can be but &s;mall, and we have means &s;ufficient in our hands to reduce them to rea&s;on. They have left us ho&s;tages more dear to them than life. Their wives, their children, their fathers, their mothers, are here in the city. Courage, Romans, the gods are for us; tho&s;e gods, who&s;e temples and altars the impious Tarquin has profaned by &s;acrifices and libations made with polluted hands, polluted with blood, and with num|berle&s;s unexpiated crimes committed again&s;t his &s;ubjects. &mdash;Ye gods, who protected our forefathers, ye genii, who watch for the pre&s;ervation and glory of Rome, do you in&s;pire us with courage and unanimity in this glorious cau&s;e, and we will, to our la&s;t breath, defend your wor&s;hip from all profanation.</P>

I &s;hall, therefore, be plain in laying before you the grounds of pa&s;t mi&s;carriages, in order to correct you in your future conduct.</P>
<P>You may remember, it is not above three or four years &s;ince we had the news of Philip's laying &s;iege to the for|tre&s;s of Juno in Thrace. It was, as I think, in Octo|ber, we received this intelligence. We voted an imme|diate &s;upply of three&s;core talents; forty men of war were ordered to &s;ea; and &s;o zealous we were, that, preferring the nece&s;&s;ities of &s;tate to our very laws, our citizens above the age of five-and-forty years were commanded to &s;erve. What followed?&mdash;A whole year was &s;pent idly without any thing done; and it was but in the third month of the following year, a little after the celebra|tion of the fea&s;t of Ceres, that Charedemus &s;et &s;ail, fur|ni&s;hed with no more than five talents, and ten galleys not half-manned.</P>
<P>A rumor was &s;pread, that Philip was &s;ick. That ru|mor was followed by another, that Philip was dead. And, then, as if all danger died with him, you dropped your preparations: whereas, then, then was your time to pu&s;h, and be active; then was your time to &s;ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e
<PB N="304" REF="021451_0303_0FB5256A42A12FF0">
your&s;elves, and confound him at once. Had your re&s;o|lutions, taken with &s;o much heat, been as warmly &s;e|conded by action, you had then been as terrible to Phi|lip, as Philip, recovered, is now to you. "To what purpo&s;e, at this time, the&s;e reflections? What is done, cannot be undone." But, by your leave, Athenians, though pa&s;t moments are not to be recalled, pa&s;t errors may be repeated. Have we not, now, a fre&s;h provoca|tion to war? Let the memory of over&s;ights, by which you have &s;uffered &s;o much, in&s;truct you to be more vigi|lant in the pre&s;ent danger. If the Olynthians are not in&s;tantly &s;uccoured, and with your utmo&s;t efforts, you become a&s;&s;i&s;tants to Philip, and &s;erve him more effectu|ally than he can help him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is not, &s;urely, nece&s;&s;ary to warn you, that votes alone can be of no con&s;equence. Had your re&s;olutions, of them&s;elves, the virtue to compa&s;s what you intend, we &s;hould not &s;ee them multiply every day, as they do, and upon every occa&s;ion, with &s;o little effect; nor would Philip be in a condition to brave and affront us in this manner.&mdash;Proceed, then, Athenians, to &s;upport your deliberations with vigor. You have heads capable of advi&s;ing what is be&s;t; you have judgment and experi|ence to di&s;cern what is right; and you have power and opportunity to execute what you determine. What time &s;o proper for action? What occa&s;ion &s;o happy? And when can you hope for &s;uch another, if this be ne|glected? Has not Philip, contrary to all treaties, in&s;ult|ed you in Thrace? Does he not, at this in&s;tant, &s;traiten and invade your confederates, whom you have &s;olemnly &s;worn to protect? Is he not an implacable enemy? a faithle&s;s ally? the u&s;urper of provinces, to which he has no title nor pretence? a &s;tranger, a barbarian, a tyrant? and, indeed, what is he not?</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, I be&s;eech you, men of Athens, how different your conduct appears, from the practices of your ance&s;|tors. They were friends to truth and plain dealing, and dete&s;ted flattery and &s;ervile compliance. By unanimous con&s;ent, they continued arbiters of all Greece, for the &s;pace of forty-five years, without interruption: a public fund, of no le&s;s than ten thou&s;and talents, was ready &s;o any emergency: they exerci&s;ed over the kings of Mace|don
<PB N="305" REF="021451_0304_0FB5256BDEA2E540">
that authority which is due to barbarians; obtain|ed, both by &s;ea and land, in their own per&s;ons, frequent and &s;ignal victories; and, by their noble exploits, tran&s;|mitted to po&s;terity an immortal memory of their virtue, &s;uperior to the reach of malice and detraction. It is to them we owe that great number of public edifices, by which the city of Athens exceeds all the re&s;t of the world in beauty and magnificence. It is to them we owe &s;o many &s;tately temples, &s;o richly embelli&s;hed, but, above all, adorned with the &s;poils of vanqui&s;hed ene|mies.&mdash;But, vi&s;it their own private habitations; vi&s;it the hou&s;es of Ari&s;tides, Miltiades, or any other of tho&s;e patriots of antiquity;&mdash;you will find nothing, not the lea&s;t mark or ornament, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from their neighbors. They took part in the government, not to enrich them&s;elves, but the public; they had no &s;cheme or ambition, but for the public; nor knew any intere&s;t, but the public. It was by a clo&s;e and &s;teady application to the general good of their country, by an exemplary piety towards the immortal gods, by a &s;trict faith and religious hone&s;ty betwixt man and man, and a mode|ration always uniform and of a piece, they e&s;tabli&s;hed that reputation, which remains to this day, and will la&s;t to utmo&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Such, O men of Athens! were your ance&s;tors: &s;o glo|rious in the eye of the world; &s;o bountiful and munifi|cent to their country; &s;o &s;paring, &s;o mode&s;t, &s;o &s;elf-denying to them&s;elves. What re&s;emblance can we find, in the pre&s;ent generation, of the&s;e great men? At a time, when your ancient competitors have left you a clear &s;tage; when the Lacedemonians are di&s;abled; the Thebans em|ployed in troubles of their own; when no other &s;tate whatever is in a condition to rival or mole&s;t you; in &s;hort, when you are at full liberty; when you have the opportunity and the power to become once more the &s;ole arbiters of Greece;&mdash;you permit, patiently, whole provinces to be wre&s;ted from you; you lavi&s;h the public money in &s;candalous and ob&s;cure u&s;es; you &s;uffer your allies to peri&s;h in times of peace, whom you pre&s;er|ved in time of war; and, to &s;um up all, you your&s;elves, by your mercenary court, and &s;ervile re&s;ignation to the will and plea&s;ure of de&s;igning, in&s;idious leaders, abet,
<PB N="306" REF="021451_0305_0FB5256D9E971DA0">
encourage, and &s;trengthen the mo&s;t dangerous and for|midable of your enemies. Yes, Athenians, I repeat it, you your&s;elves are the contrivers of your own ruin. Lives there a man who has confidence enough to deny it? let him ari&s;e, and a&s;&s;ign, if he can, any other cau&s;e of the &s;ucce&s;s and pro&s;perity of Philip. "But," you reply, "what Athens may have lo&s;t in reputation abroad, &s;he has gained in &s;plendor at home. Was there ever a greater appearance of pro&s;perity; a greater face of plen|ty? Is not the city enlarged? Are not the &s;treets better paved, hou&s;es repaired and beautified?"&mdash;Away with &s;uch trifles! Shall I be paid with counters? An old &s;quare new vamped up! a fountain! an aqueduct! Are the&s;e acqui&s;itions to brag of? Ca&s;t your eye upon the ma|gi&s;trate, under who&s;e mini&s;try you boa&s;t the&s;e precious improvements. Behold the de&s;picable creature, rai&s;ed, all at once, from dirt to opulence; from the lowe&s;t ob|&s;curity to the highe&s;t honors. Have not &s;ome of the&s;e up&s;tarts built private hou&s;es and &s;eats vying with the mo&s;t &s;umptuous of our public palaces? And how have their fortunes and their power increa&s;ed, but as the commonwealth has been ruined and impoveri&s;hed!</P>
<P>To what are we to impute the&s;e di&s;orders; and to what cau&s;e a&s;&s;ign the decay of a &s;tate &s;o powerful and flouri&s;hing in pa&s;t times?&mdash;The rea&s;on is plain. The &s;er|vant is now become the ma&s;ter. The magi&s;trate was then &s;ub&s;ervient to the people; puni&s;hments and re|wards were properties of the people; all honors, dig|nities, and preferments, were di&s;po&s;ed by the voice and favor of the people: but the magi&s;trate, now, has u&s;urped the right of the people, and exerci&s;es an arbi|trary authority over his ancient and natural lord. You mi&s;erable people! the meanwhile, without money, with|out friends; from being the ruler, are become the &s;er|vant; from being the ma&s;ter, the dependant: happy that the&s;e governors, into who&s;e hands you have thus re&s;igned your own power, are &s;o good and &s;o gracious as to continue your poor allowance to &s;ee plays.</P>
<P>Believe me, Athenians, if, recovering from this le|thargy, you would a&s;&s;ume the ancient freedom and &s;pi|rit of your fathers; if you would be your own &s;oldiers and your own commanders, confiding no longer your
<PB N="307" REF="021451_0306_0FB5257422DF5E40">
affairs in foreign or mercenary hands; if you would charge your&s;elves in your own defenee, employing a|broad, for the public, what you wa&s;te in unprofitable plea&s;ures at home; the world might, once more, behold you making a figure worthy of Athenians. "You would have us then (you &s;ay) do &s;ervice in our armies, in our own per&s;ons; and, for &s;o doing, you would have the pen&s;ions we receive in time of peace accepted as pay in time of war. Is it thus we are to under&s;tand you?" &mdash;Yes, Athenians, 'tis my plain meaning. I would make it a &s;tanding rule, that no per&s;on, great or little, &s;hould be the better for the public money, who &s;hould grudge to employ it for the public &s;ervice. Are we in peace! the public is charged with your &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Are we in war, or under a nece&s;&s;ity, as at this time, to enter into a war? let your gratitude oblige you to accept, as pay, in defence of your benefactors, what you receive, in peace, as mere bounty&mdash;Thus, without any innova|tion; without altering or aboli&s;hing any thing, but per|nicious novelties, introduced for the encouragement of &s;loth and idlene&s;s; by converting only, for the future, the &s;ame funds, for the u&s;e of the &s;erviceable, which are &s;pent, at pre&s;ent, upon the unprofitable; you may be well &s;erved in your armies; your troops regularly paid; ju&s;tice duly admini&s;tered; the public revenues reformed, and increa&s;ed; and every member of the commonwealth, rendered u&s;eful to his country, according to his age and ability, without any further burden to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>This, O men of Athens! is what my duty prompted me to repre&s;ent to you upon this occa&s;ion.&mdash;May the gods in&s;pire you, to determine upon &s;uch mea&s;ures, as may be mo&s;t expedient, for the particular and general good of our country!</P>

<P>MR. Belcour, I am rejoiced to &s;ee you; you are welcome to England.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you heartily, good Mr. Stockwell. You and I have long conver&s;ed at a di&s;tance: now we are met: and the plea&s;ure this meeting gives me, amply com|pen&s;ates for the perils I have run through in accompli&s;h|ing it.</P>

<P>What perils, Mr Belcour? I could not have thought you would have had a bad pa&s;&s;age at this time o'year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor had we. Courier like, we came po&s;ting to your &s;hores upon the pinions of the &s;wifte&s;t gales that ever blew. It is upon Engli&s;h ground all my difficulties have ari&s;en: it is the pa&s;&s;age from the river-&s;ide I com|plain of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! What ob&s;tructions can you have met between this and the river-&s;ide?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Innumerable! Your town's as full of defiles as the i&s;land of Cor&s;ica; and, I believe, they are as ob&s;ti|nately defended. So much hurry, bu&s;tle, and confu|&s;ion, on your quays; &s;o many &s;ugar-ca&s;ks, porter-butts, and common council men, in your &s;treets; that, unle&s;s a man marched with artillery in his front, it is more than the labor of a Hercules can effect to make any to|lerable way through your town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;orry you have been &s;o incommoded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, faith, it was all my own fault. Accu|&s;tomed to a land of &s;laves, and out of patience with the whole tribe of cu&s;tom-hou&s;e extortioners, boatmen, tide-waiters, and water-bailiffs, that be&s;et me on all &s;ides wor&s;e than a &s;warm of mu&s;quetoes, I preceeded a little too roughly to bru&s;h them away with my ratan. The
<PB N="309" REF="021451_0308_0FB52577DD8B2410">
&s;turdy rogues took this in dudgeon; and, beginning to rebel, the mob-cho&s;e different &s;ides, and a furious &s;cuffle en&s;ued; in the cour&s;e of which, my per&s;on and apparel &s;uffered &s;o much, that I was obliged to &s;tep into the fir&s;t tavern to refit, before I could make my approaches in any decent trim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Mr Belcour, it is a rough &s;ample you have had of my countrymen's &s;pirit; but, I tru&s;t, you will not think the wor&s;e of them for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, not at all: I like them the better. Were I only a vi&s;itor, I might perhaps wi&s;h them a little more tractable; but, as a fellow-&s;ubject and a &s;harer in their freedom, I applaud their &s;pirit&mdash;though I feel the effects of it in every bone in my &s;kin.&mdash;Well, Mr Stockwell, for the fir&s;t time in my life, here am I in England; at the fountain-head of plea&s;ure; in the land of beauty, of arts, and elegancies. My happy &s;tars have given me a good e&s;tate, and the con&s;piring winds have blown me hither to &s;pend it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>To u&s;e it, not to wa&s;te it, I &s;hould hope; to treat it, Mr Belcour, not as a va&s;&s;al over whom you have a wanton de&s;potic power, but as a &s;ubject whom you are bound to govern with a temperate and re&s;train|ed authority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir, mo&s;t truly &s;aid; mine's a commi&s;&s;ion, not a right: I am the offspring of di&s;tre&s;s, and every child of &s;orrow is my brother. While I have hands to hold, therefore, I will hold them open to mankind. But, Sir, my pa&s;&s;ions are my ma&s;ters; they take me where they will; and, oftentimes, they leave to rea&s;on and virtue nothing but my wi&s;hes and my &s;ighs.</P>

<P>Come, come, the man who can accu&s;e, cor|rects him&s;elf.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! that is an office I am weary of. I wi&s;h a friend would take it up: I would to heaven you had lei&s;ure for the employ. But, did you drive a trade to the four corners of the world, you would not find the ta&s;k &s;o toil&s;ome as to keep me free from faults.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stock.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I am not di&s;couraged. This candour tells me I &s;hould not have the fault of &s;elf-conceit to combat; that, at lea&s;t, is not among&s;t the number.</P>

<P>No; if I knew that man on earth who thought

of a table: &s;he has a very little &s;tomach: &s;he does not eat above an ounce in a fortnight: and then, as to the quality of what &s;he eats, you'll have no need of a French cook upon her account. As for &s;weet-meats, &s;he mortally hates them &s;o there is the article of de&s;&s;erts wiped off all at once.

<P>SPEAK the &s;peech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you; trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it as many of our players do, I had as lieve the town-crier had &s;poke my lines. And, do not &s;aw the air too much with your hand; but u&s;e all gently: for in the very torrent, tempe&s;t, and, as I may &s;ay, whirlwind of your pa&s;&s;ion, you mu&s;t acquire and beget a temperance that may give it &s;moothne&s;s. Oh! it offends me to the &s;oul, to hear a robu&s;teous periwig-pated fellow tear a pa&s;&s;ion to tatters, to very rags, to &s;plit the ears of the ground|lings; who (for the mo&s;t part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb &s;hows and noi&s;e. Pray, you avoid it.</P>
<P>Be not too tame neither: but let your own di&s;cretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this &s;pecial ob&s;ervance, that you o'er|&s;tep not the mode&s;ty of nature: for any thing &s;o overdone, is from the purpo&s;e of playing; who&s;e end is&mdash;to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to &s;how virtue her own feature, &s;corn her own image, and the very age and body of the time, his form and pre&s;&s;ure. Now, this overdone or come tardy of, though it make the un&s;kil|ful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the cen|&s;ure of one of which, mu&s;t, in your allowance, o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. Oh! there be players that I have &s;een play, and heard others prai&s;e, and that high|ly, that, neither having the accent of chri&s;tian, nor the gait of chri&s;tian, pagan, nor man, have &s;o &s;trutted and bellowed, that I have thought &s;ome of Nature's journey-men had made men, and not made them well; they imitated humanity &s;o abominably.</P>

If ex|erci&s;e throws off all &s;uperfluities, temperance prevents them; if exerci&s;e clears the ve&s;&s;els, temperance neither &s;atiates nor over&s;trains them; if exerci&s;e rai&s;es proper ferments in the humors, and promotes the circulation of the blood, temperance gives nature her full play, and enables her to exert her&s;elf in all her force and vigor; if exerci&s;e di&s;&s;ipates a growing di&s;temper, temperance &s;tarves it.

<P N="7">7. I have always preferred cheerfulne&s;s to mirth. The latter I con&s;ider as an act, the former as a habit of the mind. Mirth is &s;hort and tran&s;ient, cheerfulne&s;s fixed and permanent. Tho&s;e are often rai&s;ed into the greate&s;t tran&s;ports of mirth, who are &s;ubject to the greate&s;t de|pre&s;&s;ions of melancholy: on the contrary, cheerfulne&s;s, though it does not give the mind &s;uch an exqui&s;ite glad|ne&s;s, prevents us from falling into any depths of &s;orrows. Mirth is like a fla&s;h of lightning, that breaks through a gloom of clouds, and glitters for a moment; cheerful|ne&s;s keeps up a kind of day-light in the mind, and fills it with a &s;teady and perpetual &s;erenity.

Di&s;cretion points out the noble&s;t ends to us, and pur&s;ues the mo&s;t proper and laudable methods of attaining them; cunning has only private &s;elfi&s;h aims, and &s;ticks at nothing which may make them &s;ucceed; di&s;cretion has large and extended views, and, like a well-formed eye, commands a whole horizon; cunning is a kind of &s;hort-&s;ightedne&s;s, that di&s;covers the minu|te&s;t objects which are near at hand, but is not able to di&s;cern things at a di&s;tance.

The latter, is like the owner of a barren country, that fills his eye with the pro&s;pect of naked hills and plains, which produce nothing either profitable or ornamental: the former, beholds a beautiful and &s;pacious land&s;cape, di|vided into delightful gardens, green meadows, fruitful fields; and can &s;carce ca&s;t his eye on a &s;ingle &s;pot of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, that is not covered with &s;ome beautiful plant or flower.

As there is a worldly happine&s;s, which God per|ceives to be no other than di&s;gui&s;ed mi&s;ery; as there are worldly honors, which, in his e&s;timation, are reproach: &s;o there is a worldly wi&s;dom, which in his &s;ight, is fool|i&s;hne&s;s. Of this worldly wi&s;dom the characters are gi|ven in the &s;criptures, and placed in contra&s;t with tho&s;e of the wi&s;dom which is from above. The one, is the wi&s;dom of the crafty; the other, that of the upright: the one, terminates in &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; the other, in charity: the one is full of &s;trife and bitter envying; the other, of mercy and good fruits.
