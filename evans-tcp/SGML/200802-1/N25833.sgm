<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IN &s;ubmitting the following memorials to the public eye, the Academy of Medicine have been influenced by a sense of what they conceive to be their duty, not only to themselves, but to their fellow citizens. Persuaded, that, where candour and good temper prevail, a collision of sentiments is by no means unfavourable to the dis|covery of truth, they have ventured, with the less reluctance, to controvert the opinion of the College of Physicians, respecting the origin of our late Epidemic.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In support of all the facts, principles, and opinions, which their memorials contain, the Aca|demy are possessed of ample and satisfactory docu|ments. Of these, they have not thought it neces|sary to publish any, except such as relate to par|ticular points, which have, unfortunately, become subjects of misrepresentation. To remove the errors and prejudices resulting from this occurrence, the publication of a few of their documents was found to be essential. The rest are carefully preserved among the records of the Academy, and will, if called
<PB REF="034352_0003_0FFF0B0EA4B7D760">
for, by the circumstances of any future emergency, be, in like manner, submitted to the examination of the public.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Academy are unwilling to neglect the present opportunity, of begging the College of Phy|sicians to be a&s;&s;ured, that, in the following inves|tigation, they have been actuated by no sentiments of unkindness towards them, either in their associate or individual capacity. Their only motive has been, in common, as they presume, with that of the College, an earne&s;t wi&s;h for the ascertainment of truth, on a subject, in which the interests of both are equally involved. Notwithstanding, therefore, the difference of opinion which prevails between them on several important particulars, it is the desire of the Academy still to cultivate and main|tain with that learned body, such a degree of good understanding and harmony, as ought ever to characterize both societies and individuals, en|gaged in the promotion of the same branch of science.</HI></P>

<P>I AM de&s;irous to obtain, for the information of the Legi&s;lature, the mo&s;t correct account of the origin, progre&s;s, and nature of the di&s;ea&s;e that has recently afflicted the city of Philadelphia, with a view that the mo&s;t efficacious &s;teps &s;hould be taken to pre|vent a recurrence of &s;o dreadful a calamity. I have reque&s;ted the opinion of the College of Phy&s;icians on the &s;ubject; but, as I under&s;tand that you and many other learned members of the Faculty do not attend the deliberations of that in&s;titution, the re&s;ult of my enquiries cannot be perfectly &s;atisfactory without your co-operation and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

<HEAD>An&s;wer to the foregoing.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with your reque&s;t, the &s;ub&s;cribers have devoted them&s;elves to the inve&s;tigation of the origin, progre&s;s and nature of the fever which lately prevailed in our city, and we have now the honor of communicating to you the re&s;ult of our enquiries and ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>We conceive the fever which has lately prevailed in our city, commonly called the yellow fever, to be the bilious remitting fever of warm climates excited to a higher degree of malignity by circum&s;tances to be men|tioned hereafter.</P>
<P>Our rea&s;ons for this opinion are as follows:</P>
<P>I. The &s;amene&s;s of their origin; both being the offspring of putrefaction. Of this there are many proofs in the hi&s;tories of the yellow fever in the We&s;t-Indies. Where there is no putrefaction, the We&s;t-India
<PB N="3" REF="034352_0006_0FFF0A9E19B20C78">
i&s;lands enjoy a perfect exemption from that di&s;ea&s;e in common with northern climates.</P>
<P>II. The yellow fever makes its appearance in tho&s;e months chiefly in which the bilious fever prevails in our country, and is uniformly checked and de&s;troyed by the &s;ame cau&s;es, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> heavy rains and fro&s;ts.</P>
<P>III. The &s;ymptoms of the bilious and yellow fever are the &s;ame in their nature. They differ only in their degree. It is no objection to this a&s;&s;ertion that there is &s;ometimes a deficiency or ab&s;ence of bile in the yel|low fever. This &s;ymptom is the effect only of a torpid &s;tate of the liver, produced by the greater force of the di&s;ea&s;e acting upon that part of the body. By means of depleting remedies this torpor is removed and the di&s;ea&s;e thereby made to a&s;&s;ume its original and &s;imple bilious character.</P>
<P>IV. The common bilious and yellow fever often run into each other. By depleting remedies the mo&s;t ma|lignant yellow fever may be changed into a common bilious fever and by tonic remedies, improperly applied, the common bilious fever may be made to a&s;&s;ume the &s;ymptoms of the mo&s;t malignant yellow fever.</P>
<P>V. The common bilious and yellow fevers are alike contagious, under certain circum&s;tances of the weather and of pre-di&s;po&s;ition in the body. That the common bilious fever is contagious, we a&s;&s;ert from the ob&s;ervati|ons
<PB N="4" REF="034352_0007_0FFF0AA04957A5B8">
of &s;ome of us, and from the authority of many Phy&s;icians, who have long commanded the highe&s;t re&s;pect in medicine.</P>
<P>VI. The yellow and mild bilious fevers mutually propagate each other. We conceive a belief in the unity of the&s;e two &s;tates of fever, to be deeply intere&s;t|ing to humanity, ina&s;much as it may lead patients to an early application for medical aid, and Phy&s;icians to the u&s;e of the &s;ame remedies for each of them, vary|ing tho&s;e remedies only according to the force of the di&s;order. It is no objection to this opinion, that that &s;tate of bilious fever called the yellow fever, is a <HI>modern</HI> appearance in our country. From certain revolutions in the atmo&s;phere as yet ob&s;erved only, but not account|ed for by Phy&s;icians, di&s;ea&s;es have in all ages and countries alternately ri&s;en and fallen in their force and danger. At pre&s;ent a con&s;titution of the atmo&s;phere prevails in the United States which di&s;po&s;es to fever of a highly inflammatory character. It began in the year 1793. Its duration in other countries has been from one to fifty years. It is not peculiar to the com|mon bilious fever to have put on more inflammatory &s;ymptoms than in former years. There is &s;carcely a di&s;ea&s;e which has not been affected in a &s;imilar way by the late change in our atmo&s;phere, and that does not call for a greater force of depleting remedies than were re|quired to cure them before the year 1793.</P>
<P>VII. And LASTLY. The yellow fever affects the &s;y&s;tem more than once, in common with the bilious
<PB N="5" REF="034352_0008_0FFF0AA26CE40CD8">
fever. Of this there were many in&s;tances during the prevalence of our late epidemic.</P>
<P>The fever which lately prevailed in our city appears from the documents which accompany this letter to have been derived from the following &s;ources.</P>
<P>I. Putrid exhalations from the gutters, &s;treets, ponds and mar&s;hy grounds in the neighbourhood of the city. From &s;ome one of the&s;e &s;ources we derive a ca&s;e attend|ed by Dr. Caldwell on the 9th of June&mdash;one attended by Dr. Pa&s;calis on the 22d July, and two ca&s;es attended by Dr. Ru&s;h and Dr. Phy&s;ic on the 5th and 15th of the &s;ame month; and al&s;o mo&s;t of tho&s;e ca&s;es of yellow fever, which appeared in the northern parts of the city, and near Ken&s;ington bridge, in the months of Augu&s;t, September and October. We are the more &s;atisfied of the truth of this &s;ource of the fever, from the numerous accounts we have received of the prevalence of the &s;ame fever, and from the &s;ame cau&s;es, during the late autumn in New York, and in various parts of New-Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Maryland, Virginia and South Carolina, not only in &s;ea ports, but inland towns. The peculiar di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e exhalations to produce di&s;ea&s;e and death, was evinced early in the &s;ea&s;on by the mortality which prevailed among the cats, and during every part of the &s;ea&s;on, by the mortality which prevailed in many parts of our country among hor&s;es. The di&s;ea&s;e which proved &s;o fatal to the latter animals, is known among the farmers by the name of
<PB N="6" REF="034352_0009_0FFF0AA3FAB21B98">
the <HI>Yellow Water.</HI> We conceive it to be a modifi|cation of the yellow fever.</P>
<P>II. A &s;econd &s;ource of our late fever appears to have been derived from the noxious air emitted from the hold of the &s;now Navigation, capt. Lin&s;troom, which arrived with a healthy crew from Mar&s;eilles on the 25th of July, and di&s;charged her cargo at Latimer's wharf after a pa&s;&s;age of eighty days. We are led to a&s;cribe the principal part of the di&s;ea&s;e which prevailed in the &s;outh end of the city to this noxious air, and that for the following rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fever appeared fir&s;t on board this ve&s;&s;el and in its neighbourhood, affecting a great number of per&s;ons nearly at the &s;ame time, and &s;o remote from each other that it could not be propagated by contagion.</P>
<P N="2">2. There was in the hold of this ve&s;&s;el a quantity of vegetable matters, &s;uch as prunes, almonds, olives, ca|pers, and &s;everal other articles, &s;ome of which were in a &s;tate of putrefaction.</P>
<P N="3">3. A mo&s;t offen&s;ive &s;mell was emitted from this ve&s;&s;el, after &s;he had di&s;charged her cargo, which was perceived by per&s;ons &s;everal hundred feet from the wharf where &s;he was moored.</P>
<P N="4">4. A &s;imilar fever has been produced from &s;imilar cau&s;es, in a variety of in&s;tances: we &s;hall briefly men|tion a few of them.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="034352_0010_0FFF0AA6E7A7C778">
At Tortola, a fever was produced in the month of June, in the year 1787, on board the &s;hip Britannia, capt. James Welch, from the noxious air generated from a few bu&s;hels of potatoes, which de&s;troyed the captain, mate and mo&s;t of the crew, in a few days.</P>
<P>Two &s;ailors were affected with a malignant fever, on board the&mdash;, capt. Thomas Egger, in the month of March, 1797, from the noxious air produced by wine that had putrified in the hold of the &s;hip, one of whom died &s;oon after her arrival at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>In the month of June, 1793, the Yellow Fever was generated by the noxious air of &s;ome rotted bags of pepper on board a French Indiaman, which was car|ried into the port of Bridgetown, by the Briti&s;h letter of marque Pilgrim. All the white men and mo&s;t of the negroes employed in removing this pepper, peri&s;hed with the Yellow Fever, and the foul atmo&s;phere af|fected the town, where it proved fatal to many of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>On board the Bu&s;bridge Indiaman, a Yellow Fever was produced in the month of May, 1792, on her pa&s;&s;age from England to Madra&s;s, which affected above two hundred of the crew. It was &s;uppo&s;ed to be de|rived from infection, but many circum&s;tances concur to make it probable that it was derived from noxious air. The ab&s;ence of &s;mell in the air does not militate again&s;t this opinion, for there are many proofs of the
<PB N="8" REF="034352_0011_0FFF0AA90C242B68">
mo&s;t malignant fevers being brought on by airs which produced no impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling. This is more frequently the ca&s;e when the impure air has pa&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from its &s;ource, and be|comes diluted with the purer air of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>Several ca&s;es are related by Dr. Lind, in his treati&s;e upon fever and infection of the Yellow Fever, origi|nating at &s;ea under circum&s;tances which forbade the &s;u&s;picion of infection, and which can only be a&s;cribed to the impure air generated from putrid vegetables.</P>
<P>So well known, and &s;o generally admitted is this &s;ource of Yellow Fever in warm climates, that Dr. Shannon, a late writer upon the means of preventing the di&s;ea&s;es of warm climates, in enumerating its various cau&s;es, expre&s;ly mentions <Q>the putrid effluvia of a &s;hip's hold.</Q></P>
<P>We wi&s;h due attention to be paid to the&s;e facts, not only becau&s;e they lead to the certain means of prevent|ing one of the &s;ources of this fever, but becau&s;e they explain the rea&s;ons, why &s;ailors are &s;o often its fir&s;t victims, and why from this circum&s;tance the origin of the di&s;ea&s;e has been &s;o ha&s;tily, but erroneou&s;ly a&s;cribed &s;olely to importation.</P>
<P>The fever which prevailed along the &s;hore of the Delaware, in Ken&s;ington, and which proved fatal to Mr. Jo&s;eph Bowers and two of his family, we believe
<PB N="9" REF="034352_0012_0FFF0AAC028C8AC8">
originated from the noxious air emitted from the hold of the &s;hip Huldah, Capt. Wm. Warner. This air was generated by the putrefaction of coffee, which had remained there during her voyage from Philadelphia to Hamburgh, and back again.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See appendix letter A.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of our enquiries, we were led to &s;u&s;pect one &s;ource of our late fever, to be of foreign origin. The fails of the armed &s;hip Hinde, on board of which &s;eve|ral per&s;ons had died of the Yellow Fever, on her pa&s;|&s;age from Port au Prince, and which arrived on the 4th of Augu&s;t, were &s;ent to the &s;ail &s;tore of Mr. Moy&s;e. Four per&s;ons belonging to the loft were &s;oon afterwards affected, with &s;ymptoms of a bilious Yellow Fever. We &s;hall not decide po&s;itively upon the origin of the fever in the&s;e ca&s;es; but the following facts render it probable that it was not derived from the per&s;ons who had died of it on board the &s;u&s;pected ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P N="1">1. The &s;ails emitted an offen&s;ive &s;mell; 2. three of the ca&s;es of the per&s;ons affected in the &s;ail loft were of a mild grade of the fever; 3. the fever was not propagated by contagion from any one of them; 4. the &s;ail loft was within the influence of the noxious air, which was emitted from the hold of the &s;now Naviga|tion, being not more than fifty yards, and was in the direction of the wind which blew at that time over her. The extent of this air has not been accurately a&s;certain|ed,
<PB N="10" REF="034352_0013_0FFF0AAE84B231B8">
but many analogies give us rea&s;on to believe that it may be conveyed by the wind, in its deleterious &s;tate from half a mile, to a mile.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of the opinion we have delivered of the origin of our late fever, we mu&s;t add further, that in that part of the city which lies between Walnut and Vine &s;treets, and which appeared to be free from the effects of exhalation and the noxious air of the &s;hips, there were but few ca&s;es of the fever which appeared to &s;pread by contagion, even under the mo&s;t favourable circum&s;tances for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Having pointed out the nature and origin of our late fever we hope we &s;hall be excu&s;ed in mentioning the means of preventing it in future. The&s;e are,</P>
<P>FIRST, A continuance of the pre&s;ent laws for pre|venting the importation of the di&s;ea&s;e from the We&s;t-Indies, and other parts of the world where it u&s;ually prevails.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Removing all tho&s;e matters from our &s;treet, gutters, cellars, gardens, yards, &s;tores, vaults, ponds, &amp;c. which by putrefaction in warm weather afford the mo&s;t frequent remote cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, in this country. For this purpo&s;e we recommend the appointment of a certain number of Phy&s;icians who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it &s;hall be to in&s;pect all &s;uch places in the city, the Northern Liberties and South wark, as contain any
<PB N="11" REF="034352_0014_0FFF0AB019315B28">
matters capable by putrefaction, of producing the di&s;ea&s;e and to have them removed.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, We earne&s;tly recommend the frequent wa&s;hing of all impure parts of the city in warm and dry weather, by means of the pumps, until the water of the Schuylkill can be made to wa&s;h all the &s;treets of the city; a mea&s;ure which we conceive promi&s;es to our citizens the mo&s;t durable exemption from bilious fevers of all kinds, of dome&s;tic origin.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, To guard again&s;t the frequent &s;ource of Yellow Fever from the noxious air of the holds of &s;hips, we recommend the unlading all &s;hips, with cargoes liable to putrefaction, at a di&s;tance from the city, during the months of June, July, Augu&s;t, September and October. To prevent the generation of noxious air in the &s;hips, we conceive every ve&s;&s;el &s;hould be obliged by law to carry and u&s;e a ventilator, and we recommend in a particular manner the one lately contrived by Mr. Benjamin Wynkoop.&mdash;We believe this invention to be one of the mo&s;t important and u&s;eful, that has been made in modern times, and that it is calculated to prevent not only the decay of &s;hips and cargoes, but a very frequent &s;ource of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es of all kinds, in commercial cities.</P>
<P>In thus deciding upon the nature and origin of our late fever, we expect to admini&s;ter con&s;olation to our fellow citizens upon the cau&s;e of our late calamity,
<PB N="12" REF="034352_0015_0FFF0AB25C740308">
for in pointing out its origin to the &s;en&s;es, we are en|abled immediately and certainly to prevent it. But while the only &s;ource of it is believed to be from abroad, and while its entrance into our city is believed to be in ways &s;o numerous and in&s;idious, as to elude the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible vigilance of health officers, we are led in de&s;pair to con&s;ider the di&s;ea&s;e as removed beyond the prevention of human power or wi&s;dom. It has been by adopting mea&s;ures, &s;imilar to tho&s;e we have de|livered for preventing pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, that mo&s;t of the cities in Europe, which are &s;ituated in warm lati|tudes, have become healthy in warm &s;ea&s;ons, and amid&s;t the clo&s;e&s;t commercial intercour&s;e, with nations and i&s;lands con&s;tantly afflicted with tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. The extraordinary cleanline&s;s of the Hollanders was origi|nally impo&s;ed upon them, by the frequency of pe&s;tilenti|al fevers in their cities. This habit of cleanline&s;s has continued to characterize tho&s;e people, after the cau&s;es which produced it, have probably cea&s;ed to be known.</P>
<P>In thus urging a regard to the dome&s;tic &s;ources of the Yellow Fever, we are actuated by motives of a magnitude far beyond tho&s;e which determine ordinary que&s;tions in &s;cience. Though we feel the &s;tronge&s;t conviction that the value of property, the increa&s;e of commerce and the general pro&s;perity of our city, will be eminently forwarded by the adoption of the fore|going propo&s;itions, yet the&s;e are but little objects in our view, when compared with the prevention of the immen&s;e ma&s;s of di&s;tre&s;s, which never fails to accom|pany
<PB N="13" REF="034352_0016_0FFF0AB5EDCC0B78">
a mortal epidemic. We con&s;ider our&s;elves moreover as deciding upon a que&s;tion, which is to affect the lives and happine&s;s, not only of the pre&s;ent inhabitants of Philadelphia, but of millions yet unborn, in every part of the globe.</P>

<HEAD>MEMORIAL OF THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the Senate and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the Com|monwealth of Penn&s;ylvania, the Memorial of the College of Phy&s;icians of Philadelphia re&s;pectfully repre&s;ents:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT your Memoriali&s;ts, deeply affected with the calamities produced by the di&s;ea&s;e which has recently occurred among&s;t us, are impelled by a &s;en&s;e of duty to their fellow citizens and them&s;elves, to inform you, that they con&s;ider the laws which were enacted for the purpo&s;e of pre&s;erving this city from malignant, contagious di&s;orders, as very imperfect.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject being of immen&s;e importance, they hope to be excu&s;ed for &s;tating their &s;entiments with re&s;pect to it at large.</P>
<P>They are of opinion, that the di&s;ea&s;e which produced &s;o much mortality and di&s;tre&s;s in the year 1793, was imported into this city from the We&s;t-Indies; and they are confirmed in this &s;entiment, by the circum&s;tances attending the di&s;ea&s;e of this year, which they con&s;ider as of the &s;ame nature, and derived from the &s;ame &s;ource.</P>
<P>Some of their mo&s;t important rea&s;ons for this opini|on, are as follow:&mdash;The di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion is e&s;&s;entially
<PB N="15" REF="034352_0018_0FFF0AB91478A190">
different from the fevers that occur in this climate, and which originate from dome&s;tic cau&s;es. This dif|ference particularly regards the general progre&s;s of the &s;ymptoms, and the mortality, as is evident upon a compari&s;on of its hi&s;tory with that of the ordinary di&s;ea&s;es of this city.</P>
<P>A di&s;ea&s;e which re&s;embles the fever of 1793 and of this year, in many important points, has long been known in the We&s;t-Indies, and tho&s;e parts of Ameri|ca &s;ituated between the tropics; and in &s;even or eight different in&s;tances in which a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e has oc|curred in the United States, in the cour&s;e of this century, there is good rea&s;on to believe that it was derived from tho&s;e countries. In mo&s;t of the in&s;tances, the original hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e contains the informa|tion that it was imported. In &s;ome ca&s;es, the infection can be traced to the imported clothing of per&s;ons who died in the We&s;t-Indies. In mo&s;t of the ca&s;es where the importation cannot be a&s;certained, the fir&s;t ap|pearance of the di&s;ea&s;e has been, as in the other in|&s;tances, in the neighbourhood of the &s;hipping, or among per&s;ons connected with ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances attending the fever of this year are extremely in point; and the narrative which ac|companies this, will, we tru&s;t, &s;atisfy you that it was imported.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion, commences invariably in our &s;ea-ports, while inland towns, equally expo&s;ed

to the ordinary cau&s;es of fever, e&s;cape; and in the two la&s;t in&s;tances of its occurrence in Philadelphia, the &s;uburbs and the country adjacent, were more healthy than u&s;ual at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on; and at the commencement of the di&s;ea&s;e, all the parts of the city, excepting the &s;mall &s;paces to which it was confined, were remarkably healthy.</P>
<P>It exi&s;ts in the We&s;t-Indies, particularly in time of war, when great numbers of &s;trangers are to be found there; and reference to dates will &s;hew, that in mo&s;t of the in&s;tances of the occurrence of the di&s;ea&s;e in the United States, there has been war in the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>Your Memoriali&s;ts are aware, that ca&s;es may be adduced where the di&s;ea&s;e has occurred in per&s;ons, who were not known to have been expo&s;ed to im|ported contagions, but &s;uch is the &s;ubtile nature of this power, that it often exi&s;ts un&s;u&s;pected; and &s;imilar difficulties occur re&s;pecting the &s;mall-pox, and other contagions, allowed by all to be of foreign origin. There al&s;o occur, although very rarely, &s;oli|tary ca&s;es of malignant remitting fevers, the &s;ymptoms of which re&s;emble &s;o much the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion, that they are often &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame; but there is this e&s;&s;ential difference, that a malignant remittent fever has never been to our knowledge con|tagious in this climate.</P>

The difference of &s;entiments among phy&s;icians, now &s;o much regretted, re&s;embles that which almo&s;t always takes place, when the plague is introduced into any of the civilized parts of Europe, where it is not well known.

<HEAD>Narrative of Facts relative to the probable Origin, and Progre&s;s, of the Malignant Contagious Fever which lately appeared at the junction of Penn and Pine Streets.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;hip Arethu&s;a, Captain Keith, &s;ailed about June 1, 1797, from Port Royal in Jamaica for the Havannah, with &s;laves; during the pa&s;&s;age two men died with a fever, which Mr. Stephen King&s;ton, a gentleman of this city, who was a pa&s;&s;enger on board, and has frequently &s;een the di&s;ea&s;e, believes to have been the Yellow Fever, one having the black vomit. After remaining &s;ome days at the Havannah, the ve&s;&s;el proceeded for Philadelphia, and arrived in the &s;tream oppo&s;ite to Pine Street, July 23, 1797. At the Capes of Delaware &s;he took on board a Pilot, and performed a quarantine of five days at State I&s;land.
<PB N="19" REF="034352_0022_0FFF0AC2906DFE60">
The Pilot was attacked with a fever, the day of their arrival at the city, and went on &s;hore the &s;ame day, when he was vi&s;ited by Dr. Currie, who has been much conver&s;ant with the Yellow Fever, and was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the re&s;emblance of his &s;ymptoms to tho&s;e of that di&s;ea&s;e, that he mentioned the ca&s;e as &s;u&s;picious, to one of his friends.</P>
<P>The Arethu&s;a was moored at Mr. Jo&s;eph Ru&s;&s;ell's wharf, out&s;ide of two ve&s;&s;els which lay there when &s;he arrived, her crew left her immediately after &s;he was moored, and the next day returned for their cloathing, &amp;c. when they cro&s;&s;ed and re-cro&s;&s;ed the above men|tioned &s;hips. Two boys only and the captain (who was on board occa&s;ionally) compo&s;ed the crew of the out|ermo&s;t &s;hip, or that immediately contiguous to the Arethu&s;a; but the innermo&s;t ve&s;&s;els, the brig Iris from Oporto, had a crew of the u&s;ual number. On the twenty ninth day of July, five men of this crew were taken ill with fever, and attended by Dr. J. Stuart, who &s;tates in his report to the College of Phy&s;icians, that the &s;ymptoms were &s;imilar in all, tho' varying in the degree of violence; four of the&s;e recovered, but one died with unequivocal marks of the malignant Yellow Fever. A &s;ervant of George Latimer, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> who lived about 100 yards to the north of this ve&s;&s;el, and was frequently on the wharves, was attacked, July 30, with a fever which was highly contagious and ma|lignant, of which he died in a few days.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="034352_0023_0FFF0AC71F410D88">
Mr. N. Lewis, who kept a compting room which was about the &s;ame di&s;tance from the Arethu&s;a, was attack|ed about the &s;ame time, and died al&s;o in five days, of a fever which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be of the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>Mr. Dominick Joyce, who was much engaged on board a &s;hip near the Arethu&s;a, was attacked, Augu&s;t 3d. with a fever of the &s;ame kind, but re|covered. A man who lived in a &s;tore on the South &s;ide of Pine Street, about 150 yards from the river, was attacked with a malignant fever about this time, and died in a few days.</P>
<P>About the &s;ixth of Augu&s;t, Mr. Fergu&s;on, who&s;e yard adjoined the wharf where the Arethu&s;ia and Iris lay, was attacked with a malignant fever, and the &s;ame day Mr. John Plankinghorn's girl, who lived nearly oppo&s;ite to Mr. Fergu&s;on's acro&s;s Penn Street, and worked in a yard which was &s;ituated very near to the above mentioned &s;tore in Pine &s;treet, was al&s;o attacked with fever, they both died on the fifth or &s;ixth day after the attack, Mrs. Fergu&s;on with very &s;u&s;picious, and Mr. Plankinghorn's girl, with com|plete and unequivocal &s;ymptoms of the Yellow Fever. In this manner the di&s;ea&s;e continued to &s;pread, &s;o that by the middle of Augu&s;t, or within three weeks from the arrival of the Arethu&s;a, above ten per&s;ons had died, who either lived or were engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s within 300 yards of the Arethu&s;a, and this at a time when the other parts of the city were &s;o healthy, that it is
<PB N="21" REF="034352_0024_0FFF0AC8A3A55DC0">
probable all the other deaths which occurred in it were not equal in number to tho&s;e which occurred in this &s;mall di&s;trict. After this the di&s;ea&s;e gradually extended it&s;elf to Southwark, and at the &s;ame time became thinly &s;cattered through the city, where its de&s;tructive effects are but too well known.</P>

<HEAD>Facts relative to the &s;ickly &s;tate of the &s;hip HIND.</HEAD>
<P>It appears from the depo&s;itions of Francis Tow, Nicholas Ben&s;on, and William Cooper, &s;eamen on board the armed &s;hip Hind, taken before Chief Ju&s;tice M'Kean, that about the beginning of July 1797, the Hind &s;ailed from Port-au-Prince, bound to Philadel|phia, with a cargo of &s;ugar and coffee, and with 43 pa&s;&s;engers; of which number 23 were whites and twenty coloured per&s;ons, that they touched at Cape Nichola Mole, where they remained eight days and di&s;charged a part of their cargo, in lieu thereof taking in a quantity of &s;tone balla&s;t; during the time they lay at the Mole the pa&s;&s;engers were occa&s;ionally on &s;hore. It would appear that they left the Mole between the 12th, and 15th, of July, and arrived at this port, af|ter a pa&s;&s;age of twenty or twenty one days. About three or four days after their departure from the Mole, five or &s;ix white per&s;ons and one negro of the pa&s;&s;engers were attacked with fever, the white per&s;ons &s;o attacked were ob&s;erved to become very yellow.
<PB N="22" REF="034352_0025_0FFF0ACA28A6F3B0">
During the pa&s;&s;age four other coloured per&s;ons and five of the crew fell ill of fever: on or two of the latter number, after the ve&s;&s;el entered the capes of Delaware; but only a coloured boy and child died during the pa&s;&s;age, and were thrown overboard after the ve&s;&s;el entered the river. Upon the arrival of the ve&s;&s;el oppo&s;ite the Marine Ho&s;pital, in con&s;equence of orders from the captain, four &s;ick per&s;ons were &s;ecreted and did not come under the in&s;pection of the Phy&s;i|cian of the Port; exclu&s;ive of the&s;e, two women were &s;ick in the cabin. After pa&s;&s;ing the Fort one of the &s;eamen was taken ill, went on &s;hore, and was after|wards carried to the Marine Ho&s;pital; and two other and per&s;ons were taken on &s;hore &s;ick. So far go the depo&s;itions.</P>
<P>From information obtained from the Health Of|fice, it appears, that the Hind was examined at the Fort on the &s;econd, and arrived at Philadelphia on the fourth of Augu&s;t; and that Mr. Doughty, one of the In&s;pectors of the Health Office, &s;ent to the Marine Ho&s;pital on the 13th of Augu&s;t, Peter Malo|&s;io, one of the crew of the Hind then re&s;iding in Love Lane, and on the 14th a Portugue&s;e from near the junction of Penn and South Streets, who had been landed there; and that another per&s;on was &s;ick of a &s;u&s;picious fever at Mrs. O'Connor's, in Al|mond near Front Street. Both the&s;e were from on board the Hind, and the Portugue&s;e above-mentioned had been vi&s;ited by Dr. Currie, who declares his di&s;ea&s;e to have been Yellow Fever.</P>

<HEAD>Letter from the ACADEMY OF MEDICINE to THOMAS MIFFLIN, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> Governor of the State of Penn&s;ylvania.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Phy&s;icians, who an&s;wered your letter of the &s;ixth of November, re&s;pecting the origin and nature of the epidemic fever which lately prevailed in the city of Philadelphia, having, with others of their medical brethren, a&s;&s;ociated them&s;elves under the name of "The Academy of Medicine of Philadelphia," beg leave, in that capacity, to addre&s;s you again up|on the intere&s;ting &s;ubject of the &s;aid letter.</P>
<P>The Academy have &s;een, with regret, a memorial, from the College of Phy&s;icians of the city, to the legi&s;la|ture, accompanied with a "narrative of facts" in|tended to e&s;tabli&s;h an opinion contrary to that, which the &s;ub&s;cribers of the an&s;wer to your letter, conceive they had therein proved in the mo&s;t irrefragable man|ner.</P>
<P>As the opinion appears to us replete with danger to the lives of our fellow citizens, and to the pro&s;perity of our city, we deem our&s;elves bound by the principles of humanity, and the obligations of patrioti&s;m, to make a few remarks upon it; and to &s;hew that it is founded upon partial inve&s;tigations, and mi&s;taken ideas of the nature of the Yellow Fever.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="034352_0027_0FFF0ACF8C352710">
The College have a&s;cribed the origin of the late epidemic to the &s;hips Arethu&s;a, captain Keith, from Havanna, and Hind, captain Patot, from Port-au-Prince. The memorial &s;ets forth that, <Q>the &s;hip Are|thu&s;a, capt. Keith, &s;ailed about the fir&s;t of June, from Port Royal in Jamaica, for the Havanna with &s;laves; during the pa&s;&s;age two men died with a fever, which Mr. Stephen King&s;ton, a gentleman of this city who was a pa&s;&s;enger on board, and has frequently &s;een the di&s;ea&s;e, believes to have been the Yellow Fever, one having the black vomit.</Q> Admitting the fact, which re&s;ts merely upon the be|lief of a per&s;on not medically educated, yet the argu|ments hereafter to be adduced, it is pre&s;umed, will de&s;troy the probability of its being introduced by this &s;hip. That the i&s;land of Jamaica was healthy at the time the Arethu&s;a &s;ailed, appears from the an&s;wers given by the captain of the &s;aid &s;hip, to the official in|terrogatories filed in the Health-Office relative to this &s;ubject; and from tho&s;e of capt. Henry Latimer, of the Brig Maria, who &s;ailed from the above port about the &s;ame day. That the di&s;ea&s;e of which the men died was not contagious is rendered probable by its not having &s;pread among the pa&s;&s;engers or crew who amounted to &s;eventy, all of whom arrived in good health at the Havanna on the twenty-fir&s;t of June. But &s;uppo&s;ing the di&s;ea&s;e to have been of a contagious nature, the precautions taken after the deaths, would have been &s;ufficient to have de&s;troyed any remains of
<PB N="25" REF="034352_0028_0FFF0AD1F341B828">
the contagion. From Mr. Brien's depo&s;ition it ap|pears, that <Q>The cloathing, bedding and articles belonging to the decea&s;ed were thrown overboard, and their births clean&s;ed and well &s;prinkled with vinegar.</Q> And we are authorized further to a&s;&s;ert, that the &s;hip underwent &s;uch a complete clean&s;ing while at the Havanna, after landing the &s;laves, as pru|dence would dictate to a &s;hip-ma&s;ter, in every &s;imilar ca&s;e. The &s;hip, moreover, after lying at the Havanna fourteen days, during which time all on board remain|ed well, arrived oppo&s;ite the Health-Office on State i&s;land, on the eighteenth of July. During the whole of this pa&s;&s;age her hatches were con&s;tantly open, where|by the mo&s;t ample means for a free current of air were afforded, which could not fail to di&s;&s;ipate any remains of contagion which could po&s;&s;ibly have continued after her former purifications. The &s;hip performed five days quarantine oppo&s;ite the Health-Office, on State-I&s;land, during which time the bedding was every day expo&s;ed upon deck and was once wa&s;hed by a rain. The crew moreover remained well, except the captain, who was affected with a rheumati&s;m, and the mate, with a lax, both of whom &s;oon recovered. The pilot who conducted this &s;hip was attacked on the twenty-third of July, and allowing three days for the time he had been expo&s;ed to the contagion before his fever appeared, there will remain forty &s;ix days from the time the &s;hip left King&s;ton till her arrival in our river. From the known laws of the contagion of the Yellow
<PB N="26" REF="034352_0029_0FFF0AD378E82938">
Fever, and the di&s;tance of time at which it u&s;ually ap|pears, after per&s;ons have been expo&s;ed to the contagion, the Academy conceive it &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible, if any porti|on of contagion had been left by the before-mentioned per&s;ons, that it would have remained inactive for above forty &s;ix days, expo&s;ed as the crew were to the ex|citing cau&s;es of fatigue, night watching and the vici&s;itudes of the weather. The perfect freedom from di&s;ea&s;e which all on board enjoyed, mu&s;t therefore be admitted as proof that no contagion did exi&s;t, and con&s;equently that the pilot and others could not have derived their di&s;ea&s;e from that &s;ource.</P>
<P>The College further &s;tate that <Q>The pilot was attacked with a fever, the day of his arrival with the &s;hip at the city and went on &s;hore the &s;ame day, when he was vi&s;ited by Dr. Currie, who has been much conver&s;ant with the Yellow Fever, and who was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the re&s;emblance of his &s;ymptoms to tho&s;e of that di&s;ea&s;e, that he mention|ed the ca&s;e as &s;u&s;picious to one of his friends.</Q></P>
<P>In addition to the arguments, before adduced, for &s;uppo&s;ing that the pilot could not have taken his di&s;ea&s;e from any remains of contagion on board, the Academy further remark, that the &s;ource from whence he derived his di&s;ea&s;e was probably, and as he be|lieves, from a current of cold air during the night, while &s;leeping in the open cabbin of the &s;hip, after a warm day, which preceded that on which the qua|rantine
<PB N="27" REF="034352_0030_0FFF0AD509B86740">
of the &s;hip was ended. His indi&s;po&s;ition came on the next morning, and &s;oon after his arrival in this city, a violent fever &s;ucceeded, of a kind, which we every year ob&s;erve in Philadelphia, from &s;udden changes of the weather, in the &s;ummer and autumnal months, and e&s;pecially from &s;imilar expo&s;ure on the river. It may be added, that he was but a few days confined, and that none of his friends who nur&s;ed him, or others who daily vi&s;ited him were affected by him; neither were there any precautions taken to avoid con|tagion, nor the lea&s;t intimation of danger given to tho&s;e who con&s;tantly attended him. Under all the circum|&s;tances which have been mentioned, it is impo&s;&s;ible to believe that the pilot's di&s;ea&s;e was derived from an imported contagion.</P>
<P>The College in their memorial have in&s;inuated that the crew of the Brig Iris were infected with the Yellow Fever by the crew of the Arethu&s;a pa&s;&s;ing acro&s;s her deck to the wharf. If this had been true or even po&s;&s;ible, it mu&s;t have been in one of the three follow|ing ways: 1&s;t. By the actual &s;ickne&s;s of the crew; 2d. By the contagion blowing off their cloaths in pa&s;&s;|ing over the decks; or, 3d. By the contagion, which had adhered to the timbers of the Arethu&s;a, being conveyed by the wind over two intermediate ve&s;&s;els to the Iris.</P>
<P>It is not pretended that any of the crew of the Arethu&s;a were indi&s;po&s;ed, therefore the fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;i|tion
<PB N="28" REF="034352_0031_0FFF0AD9CC42FE08">
mu&s;t be rejected. They could not have infected the crew of the Iris in the &s;econd mode, becau&s;e it is not alledged that they &s;topped a moment when pa&s;&s;ing over her deck. But admitting they did, it cannot be believed, that a di&s;ea&s;e could be conveyed by their cloaths, to the crew of the Iris in the open air, when it is well known, that tho&s;e cloaths when worn, and even wa&s;hed in confined lodging hou&s;es afterwards, did not infect a &s;ingle per&s;on, in any part of the city. La&s;tly, it is highly improbable that the crew of the Iris could have been infected by the timbers of the Arethu&s;a, becau&s;e, we have no proofs that the contagion of the Yellow Fever ever adheres to wood; but admitting this to be po&s;&s;ible, we reject the probability of it, be|cau&s;e, as we before ob&s;erved, the &s;hip had been well clean&s;ed and freely ventilated on her voyage from the Havanna to Philadelphia. We are the more di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;cribe the de&s;truction of contagion, if any had ex|i&s;ted, to the pure air of the ocean, from having &s;o re|peatedly ob&s;erved the effects of country air in weak|ening or de&s;troying it in the United States. The Aca|demy are moreover authori&s;ed by Dr. Stewart to a&s;&s;ert, that none of the family, with whom the five men of the Iris boarded, were infected; but that they pre&s;erv|ed their health the whole time of the prevalence of our late epidemic.</P>
<P>As the Iris lay at Pine-&s;treet wharf, and entirely with|in the limits of the exhalations from the &s;now Naviga|tion,
<PB N="29" REF="034352_0032_0FFF0ADB4FD19368">
to which we formerly referred, it is highly probable that they were infected thereby, and that the di&s;ea&s;e was excited by their intemperance in the u&s;e of Port wine, with which the brig was loaded, and by the practice of bathing them&s;elves in the river while under the influence of liquor, and heated by labour. From this conduct it is conceived by the Academy, the peculiar violence of their di&s;ea&s;es can be accounted for, as a &s;imilar cau&s;e is always ranked among the mo&s;t powerful, in the pro|duction of malignant ca&s;es of bilious yellow fever; and Dr. Stewart authori&s;es the Academy to a&s;&s;ert his belief, that the Fever, in the ca&s;es he communicated to the College, proceeded from exhalation; and he thinks mo&s;t probably, that of the &s;now Navigation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though at an early period of our late epidemic, Dr. Stewart &s;u&s;|pected that the crew of the brig Iris were infected by an intercour&s;e with that of the &s;hip Arethu&s;a, yet, a farther inve&s;tigation and a&s;certainment of facts, have &s;ince &s;atisfied him that this was not the ca&s;e, but that they mo&s;t probably, as above &s;tated derived their di&s;ea&s;e from foul air i&s;&s;uing from the hold of the &s;now Navigation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Two of the other per&s;ons mentioned by the College, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Mr. Lewis and Mr. Latimer's man, &s;aid to have been infected by the Arethu&s;a, were much nearer the &s;now Navigation than the Iris was, and were expo&s;ed to the exhalation from the former ve&s;&s;el. With regard to Mr. Lewis, we &s;hall ob&s;erve, that he was ab&s;ent from the city when the Arethu&s;a arrived, and did not return until &s;ix days afterwards, which was on the thirtieth of July. On the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, the day of his attack, it is known that he complained very much of the &s;tench
<PB N="30" REF="034352_0033_0FFF0ADCD308B610">
of the &s;now Navigation, which had now pervaded the whole neighbourhood, and expre&s;&s;ed great concern at her being permitted to remain at the wharf. The Aca|demy are authori&s;ed, by Mr. Dominick Joyce, to expre&s;s his &s;urpri&s;e at the a&s;&s;ertion of his having taken his fe|ver from the Arethu&s;a; for, though his bu&s;ine&s;s led him to the neighbourhood of that &s;hip, yet he was &s;till within the &s;phere of the extent of the foul air from the &s;now Navigation, and he acknowledges he was almo&s;t every day upon the wharf at which this ve&s;&s;el lay, and from which he, in all probability, derived his di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>As all the other per&s;ons who&s;e ca&s;es are mentioned by the College, lived within the extent of the exhala|tion from the &s;now Navigation, there can be little doubt, but that they derived it from the &s;ame air which affected the per&s;ons, who&s;e names they have mention|ed. It is remarkable, that the di&s;ea&s;e was in no in&s;tance propagated from any of them.</P>
<P>The Academy have good rea&s;on to believe, that the per&s;ons who were indi&s;po&s;ed on board the armed &s;hip Hind, after her arrival, derived their di&s;ea&s;es from the noxious air of the &s;now Navigation, in common with the per&s;ons who were affected on board the Iris, and in the neighbourhood of Mr. Latimer's wharf. It ap|pears that none of them propagated the di&s;ea&s;e to any of their attendants in the city, or in the ho&s;pital at State I&s;land, to which place &s;ome of them were &s;ent,
<PB N="31" REF="034352_0034_0FFF0AE4C9A7F838">
It is well known, moreover, that many citizens re|peatedly vi&s;ited and &s;pent whole days on board this ve&s;&s;el, none of whom were indi&s;po&s;ed in con&s;equence of it.</P>
<P>From the depo&s;itions of the &s;upercargo and of the pilot of the Hind, it will likewi&s;e appear, that the whole of the te&s;timony of the three boys is di&s;proved, except as to &s;ome unimportant particulars<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix, (B.)</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We are unable to give credit to the traditional ru|mours of the foreign origin of the Yellow Fever, in any part of the United States, ina&s;much as from the inaccuracy of the few records which have been pre|&s;erved, of the places from whence it was &s;aid to be derived, and of the manner in which it was &s;aid to have been introduced into our country, we have rea&s;on to conclude they were a&s;&s;umed without &s;ufficient inve&s;|tigation. Had the proper &s;teps been taken at all times to inve&s;tigate its origin, it is probable it would have been di&s;covered, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, to have been the off|&s;pring of dome&s;tic putrefaction. We cannot clo&s;e the arguments again&s;t the importation of the Yellow Fe|ver, without remarking, that many recent facts and ob&s;ervations render it probable, that the reports of its contagious nature have been exaggerated, and that it is not &s;o often propagated by contagion as has been &s;up|po&s;ed, more e&s;pecially in warm weather, when &s;ick
<PB N="32" REF="034352_0035_0FFF0ADF598F3298">
rooms are open night and day, to the con&s;tant acce&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h air.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erve in the memorial of the College of Phy|&s;icians an a&s;&s;ertion, that the Yellow Fever <Q>Is e&s;&s;en|tially different from the fevers that occur in this cli|mate, and which originate from dome&s;tic cau&s;es:</Q> but as no proofs are adduced in favour of that a&s;&s;er|tion, we &s;hall re&s;t our opinion of the original &s;amene&s;s of both tho&s;e &s;tates of fever, upon the facts and argu|ments which were &s;tated in our former communica|tion. We &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the idea maintained by the College, has been exploded by &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed writers upon tropical di&s;ea&s;es; and by mo&s;t of the American phy&s;icians of the &s;outhern &s;tates, who con&s;tantly con&s;ider and treat both the com|mon bilious fever, and its higher grade, called Yellow Fever, as the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, varying only in violence.</P>
<P>The Academy ob&s;erve al&s;o, with &s;urpri&s;e, another a&s;&s;ertion made by the College, that <Q>The di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion, invariably commences in our &s;ea-ports, while inland towns, equally expo&s;ed to the ordinary cau&s;es of fever, e&s;cape.</Q> To this we reply, it is well known, that in various parts of the United States, re|mote from &s;ea-ports, preci&s;ely the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, with all its characteri&s;tic &s;ymptoms, has frequently prevailed.</P>
<P>The College in their narrative have taken no notice of the origin of the Yellow Fever in Ken&s;ington, nor at
<PB N="33" REF="034352_0036_0FFF0AE1AC6F4A38">
and near Red-Bank upon the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the Dela|ware. Its origin in the former of tho&s;e places from the noxious air emitted from the putrid coffee of the &s;hip Huldah, and in the latter from mar&s;h exhalation, we conceive to be fully e&s;tabli&s;hed by the documents communicated in our appendix<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See appendix (C.)</NOTE>. The College have al&s;o ob&s;erved a total &s;ilence in their report re&s;pecting tho&s;e ca&s;es of Yellow Fever, which appeared in our city, before the arrival of the Arethu&s;a, Hind or Navi|gation. The&s;e ca&s;es were evidently derived from &s;ome of the numerous &s;ources of exhalation, from putrid &s;ub|&s;tances in and about the city. They were attended by Doctors Ru&s;h, Phy&s;ic, Caldwell, and Pa&s;calis.</P>
<P>We cannot take leave of this important &s;ubject without expre&s;&s;ing our earne&s;t de&s;ire for its candid and clo&s;e examination, by the Legi&s;lature of the State.</P>
<P>Facts and arguments &s;imilar to tho&s;e we have urged, have produced a conviction of the dome&s;tic origin of the Yellow Fever, in Bo&s;ton, New York, Baltimore, Norfolk and Charle&s;ton, and many of the other towns of the United States. This conviction has been followed by mea&s;ures, in New York, which promi&s;e in future years an exemption from the di&s;order.</P>

<P>IN &s;everal intere&s;ting particulars, re&s;pecting the origin of the epidemic of ninety-&s;even, mi&s;repre|&s;entations of facts, have much deceived the public mind. The&s;e mi&s;repre&s;entations, we believe to have been en|tirely the re&s;ult of an ea&s;y credulity, di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;t &s;atis|fied with popular report, and not of any &s;ettled intention to mi&s;lead. They have been mo&s;t &s;triking and fallacious in the accounts propagated, re&s;pecting the origin of the di&s;ea&s;e in Ken&s;ington, and at Red-bank, on the Jer&s;ey &s;hore, of the river Delaware<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the &s;ubject of the true &s;ource of the epidemic, in the&s;e two &s;ituations, the public are by no means at pre&s;ent in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of accu|rate information.</NOTE>. To be able the more effectually to counteract the pernicious in|fluence of &s;uch mi&s;tatements, the Academy of medicine have found it nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;et on foot particular in|ve&s;tigations. The re&s;ult of the&s;e, they now beg permi&s;|&s;ion to &s;ubmit, in the form of a few documents, to the candid con&s;ideration of the public.</P>
<P>It is known to have been very generally reported, and almo&s;t as generally believed, that the late epidemic was introduced into Ken&s;ington by Mr. John Bru&s;ter, who was &s;aid to have received the infection by going
<PB N="36" REF="034352_0039_0FFF0AECACF12080">
on board the armed &s;hip Hind, from Port-au-Prince. It is true, that Mr. Bru&s;ter was, at lea&s;t, among the fir&s;t (if not, indeed, him&s;elf the very fir&s;t) who was attacked by this di&s;ea&s;e in Ken&s;ington, in the &s;ummer of ninety-&s;even; but that he could not po&s;&s;ibly have derived his illne&s;s from any intercour&s;e with the &s;hip Hind, is a truth unequivocally e&s;tabli&s;hed by the fol|lowing documents, particularly by the affidavit of Mi|chael Lynn.</P>

<HEAD>DOCUMENT. <HI>Proofs of the di&s;ea&s;e, occurring from exhalation in Ken|&s;ington; from mar&s;hy grounds; and from the hold of a &s;hip.</HI></HEAD>
<P>From the books kept at the Merchants' Coffee-Hou&s;e, it appears that the Briti&s;h armed &s;hip Hind, Francis Patot Commander, from Port au-Prince, was &s;een below the Fort on the 2d. of Augu&s;t;&mdash;and at 10 o'clock of the &s;ame day &s;he came within &s;ight; and lay off the Fort for examination.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual que&s;tions were this day (2d. of Augu&s;t) propo&s;ed, by the Health-Officer, to the command|er, as appears by the paper pre&s;erved on the files at the Health-Office in this city. She came up to the city on the 3d; and entered at the Health-Office on the 4th of the month.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="034352_0040_0FFF0AEEDD9A00C0">
As no mention is made, previou&s;ly, of her being &s;een in the river; the probability is that &s;he had a &s;peedy pa&s;&s;age up the Delaware.</P>
<P>The per&s;on who fir&s;t had the Yellow Fever in Ken&s;ington, was a young man of the name of John Bru&s;ter. He is &s;aid to have taken the di&s;ea&s;e by having been on board the Hind; and through him, the fever was &s;aid to have been introduced into Ken&s;ington. Upon an examination into dates, this is altogether impo&s;&s;ible: Bru&s;ter died on the 2d. of Augu&s;t, after an illne&s;s of 4 days and 4 hours, according to his father's account, which brings the commencement of his attack to the 29th July, or four days <HI>previou&s;ly</HI> to the arrival of the Hind at the Fort. Exclu&s;ively of this fact, I have added the affidavit of Michael Lynn, to prove that he did not go on board of any ve&s;&s;el in a voyage down the river to Reedy I&s;land. Some other &s;ource for his di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t then be looked for; and this I derive from the mar&s;hy exhalations (ari&s;ing from the low grounds and meadows on one or both &s;ides of the river) to which he was expo&s;ed in his pa&s;&s;age in a &s;mall Schooner, to and from Reedy I&s;land in the middle and clo&s;e of July, aided by im|prudent expo&s;ure, by &s;leeping upon the wet decks of the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Wm. Reed, who died on the 5th of Augu&s;t after 7 days illne&s;s, appears in all probability to have derived his di&s;ea&s;e from &s;ome of the <HI>local</HI> &s;ources which
<PB N="38" REF="034352_0041_0FFF0AF06388C188">
are numerous in, and about Ken&s;ington; although if common report had been credited, we &s;hould have a&s;cribed it to the picking up of a ca&s;k which was &s;aid to have been thrown from the Hind. As how|ever, he died on the 5th, after 7 days illne&s;s; the &s;tory is altogether impo&s;&s;ible, as it brings the com|mencement of the di&s;ea&s;e to the 20th of July, or 4 days preceding the arrival of the Hind. The &s;ame &s;ources, which in Ken&s;ington, commonly produce in the Autumnal months, remittents and intermittents, have this &s;ea&s;on by the peculiar con&s;titution of the at|mo&s;phere, (whatever that may be owing to) rai&s;ed tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es to the more violent grade of Yellow Fever.</P>
<P>To the&s;e <HI>local</HI> &s;ources I would al&s;o without he&s;itati|on a&s;cribe many of tho&s;e ca&s;es which occurred in Ken|&s;ington, and which were all a&s;&s;erted to be traced to contagion.</P>
<P>In that range of hou&s;es, extending northward from the bridge over Kohock&s;ing creek, and to the we&s;t of the main York road, not le&s;s than &s;ix or &s;even people died of the Yellow Fever. The&s;e hou&s;es it will be recollected, are bounded on the we&s;t by that large portion of low mar&s;hy ground to the northward of the bridge; and from this abundant &s;ource of ex|halation, I think it mo&s;t rational to deduce the &s;eeds of the fever which occurred there. And this is rendered much more probable by the collateral evidence, of the &s;ame fever having exi&s;ted in the fa|milies
<PB N="39" REF="034352_0042_0FFF0AF1FB33B748">
of Mr. Boudinot and Mr. Leaming, near the Frankfort road, where low and mar&s;hy grounds afford ample origin to tho&s;e noxious mia&s;mata which pro|duce intermitting and remitting fevers. The &s;trag|gling manner al&s;o, in which the di&s;ea&s;e occurred in Ken&s;ington, renders it more probable that it origi|nated from <HI>local</HI> &s;ources, than that it was introduced and &s;pread through the medium of contagion.</P>
<P>The next per&s;ons who were attacked in Ken&s;ing|ton, were in the family of Mr. Jo&s;eph Bowers. The&s;e appear to have received the di&s;ea&s;e from the noxious mia&s;mata originating in the hold of a &s;hip called the Huldah, which went up to Ken&s;ington to clear out at Mr. Bowers' wharf, after di&s;charging her cargo in this city. The following is the &s;tatement which I have procured re&s;pecting this &s;hip, chiefly from the hou&s;e of Summerl and Brown, to whom &s;he was con&s;igned.</P>
<P>The &s;hip Huldah, Captain William Warner, &s;ail|ed from this port for Hamburgh, on the 18th of October, 1796, laden with coffee, &s;ugar, and furs. After landing her cargo, &s;he does not appear to have cleared out her balla&s;t, &amp;c. but &s;ailed from Ham|burgh for this place on the 11th of April, 1797, laden with hemp, iron, cordage, dry goods, gla&s;s, and brandy. She arrived at New-York on, or about, the 1&s;t day of July, where &s;he di&s;charged 109 pipes of brandy. On the 13th, &s;he &s;ailed for Philadel|phia,
<PB N="40" REF="034352_0043_0FFF0AF58609CAA8">
and entered at the Health-Office on the 17th of the month, having thirteen &s;eamen on board in perfect health, which had been the ca&s;e during the whole voyage of upwards of ninety days. She di&s;|charged hercargo at Vannuxem's wharf, between Arch and Race-&s;treets, and on Sunday the 13th of Au|gu&s;t, &s;he was carried to Mr. Bowers' wharf at Ken|&s;ington, by the mate and one of the &s;ailors, (Jo&s;eph Way of Wilmington, nephew to the late Dr. Ni|cholas Way, of this city) a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Nicolas Painter of Ken&s;ington. They proceeded to clear her out the following day, Augu&s;t 14th. After getting through a quantity of &s;and, which lay above the balla&s;t, &s;o nau&s;eous and offen&s;ive a &s;mell proceeded from her, that the mate was indi&s;po&s;ed for &s;everal days. Jo&s;eph Way was obliged to lay by; and after drooping &s;ome days, he went down to Wilmington, and there died, with a &s;evere attack of the Yellow Fever, on the &s;ame day with his uncle, in this city, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> on the 2d of September.</P>
<P>Nicholas Painter and Chri&s;topher Ru&s;h, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in cleaning her out, &s;tood the effects of this exhalation till Wedne&s;day, 16th of Augu&s;t; when they were &s;eized with violent head-ach, e&s;pecially <HI>above</HI> the eyes; &s;ickne&s;s and vomiting, and pain of the back; accom|panied by fever. Ru&s;h &s;ays, he has never completely regained his health &s;ince that period. He further &s;ays, that the &s;mell of the hold of the Huldah was &s;o nau|&s;eous,
<PB N="41" REF="034352_0044_0FFF0AF7C523B450">
that he could not get it out of his no&s;e for &s;e|veral days.</P>
<P>Upon inve&s;tigation it appeared, that the &s;mell pro|ceeded from a quantity of coffee, (which mu&s;t have e&s;caped during the voyage to Hamburgh) mixed with the bilge water and &s;and, and which was in the highe&s;t &s;tate of vegetable putrefaction; being very black, and containing worms or maggots nearly two inches in length.</P>
<P>Mr. Jo&s;eph Bowers' boy was the fir&s;t of his family who was attacked. He worked in a &s;chooner which lay along-&s;ide of the Huldah, and was &s;eized on Tue&s;|day, the 15th of Augu&s;t, and died on the 22d. Mr. Bowers him&s;elf &s;eems to have received the &s;eeds of the di&s;ea&s;e on Tue&s;day, the 15th, at which time he was on board the Huldah, and noticed the very offen&s;ive &s;mell proceeding from her hold. He &s;ickened on the Sunday following, the 20th of Augu&s;t, and died on the 25th. A maid-&s;ervant and two children al&s;o had the di&s;ea&s;e; one of the children died. It is po&s;&s;ible that the&s;e la&s;t, took the di&s;ea&s;e by contagion from Mr. Bowers or his boy; though I think it more probable, that they de|rived it from the original &s;ource, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the &s;hip's hold; as the wharf is not very di&s;tant from the hou&s;e, and as yet we know not the exact limits to which the&s;e noxious mia&s;mata may be carried, without lo&s;ing their baneful influence by dilution with the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="034352_0045_0FFF0AF94C469FB8">
Many ca&s;es which occurred in Ken&s;ington after this period, were, mo&s;t probably, derived from this &s;ource. The accounts of them are altogether wrapt in doubt and &s;uppo&s;ition. Mo&s;t of them are &s;aid to have taken it by contagion from others; but this is rendered highly improbable by the very moderate de|gree in which this fever has evinced it&s;elf to be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a contagious power; and more e&s;pecially in &s;o airy and extended a village as that of Ken&s;ington.</P>
<P>It would appear then, from the preceding pages, that the di&s;ea&s;e as it exi&s;ted in Ken&s;ington, had <HI>three</HI> different &s;ources, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>FIRST; By <HI>Exhalation</HI> or <HI>Mar&s;h-effluvia,</HI> derived from the low grounds on the banks of the Delaware; as was the ca&s;e with <HI>Bru&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>SECONDLY; From <HI>Exhalation</HI> or Mar&s;h-effluvia, deriv|ed from the local &s;ources of low grounds in, and about Ken&s;ington; as evinced in tho&s;e ca&s;es which occurred in the range of buildings, to the we&s;tward of the York road: and,</P>
<P>THIRDLY; From the <HI>Exhalation</HI> or <HI>Noxious effluvia,</HI> proceeding from putrefying vegetable matter, in the hold of the &s;hip Huldah; as in the ca&s;es of Mr. Bowers and his family, and perhaps in others.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e, po&s;&s;ibly, in &s;ome few ca&s;es &s;pread by contagion. King, a coffin-maker, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in put|ting

the dead into their coffins, may have derived his di&s;ea&s;e, of which he died, from this &s;ource. It is how|ever problematical; for he was with others, expo&s;ed to tho&s;e cau&s;es which produced it in them.</P>

<P>The Academy of Medicine cannot do otherwi&s;e than expre&s;s their &s;urpri&s;e, that the College of Phy&s;i|cians, in their re&s;earches after the origin of our late epidemic, &s;hould have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to make the armed &s;hip Hind an object of attention. It is a truth well known, that the fever had prevailed in our city &s;everal days previou&s;ly to the arrival of that ve&s;&s;el; and it is, in like manner, a truth which ought to be known, that none of tho&s;e per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed to have been infected by an intercour&s;e with her, communicat|ed their di&s;ea&s;e to any of their vi&s;itants or attendants. Where then, the Academy would beg leave to a&s;k, is

even the fainte&s;t evidence, of the &s;hip Hind having been at all in&s;trumental, in the introduction of this di&s;ea&s;e? There certainly exi&s;ts none. Nor, in a candid inve&s;ti|gation of the &s;ubject, does there appear to be ground &s;ufficient to authori&s;e, even the mention of the name of this ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>As the College of Phy&s;icians appear, however, by their late pamphlet, to have directed to the Hind, an undue &s;hare of public attention, it has become nece&s;|&s;ary to make their narrative re&s;pecting her, a &s;ubject of particular con&s;ideration. The only evidence of which that learned body are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, re&s;pecting the &s;ickly &s;tate of this ve&s;&s;el, is derived from the affidavits of three common mariners belonging to her crew; two of whom were nothing more than boys. In oppo&s;ition to the evidence delivered in the&s;e affidavits, we would here beg leave to &s;ubmit to the public, the affidavit of the &s;upercargo of the Hind. The report, deliv|ered in his depo&s;ition, is farther corroborated by the joint te&s;timony of three other re&s;pectable characters, on board the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el. From this document, it will at once appear, on how equivocal a foundation, the College have thought proper to re&s;t this part of their inve&s;tigation, re&s;pecting the origin of the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion.</P>

<P>Per&s;onally, before me, Hilary Baker, Mayor of the city of Philadelphia, came Thomas Badaraque; who, being duly &s;worn, doth depo&s;e and &s;ay, that he was &s;upercargo of the &s;hip Hind, captain Patot, from Port-au-Prince to Philadelphia, in the &s;ummer of 1797. That they touched at Cape Nichola Mole, and five days after, a child, about &s;ix months old, died from teething: that a negro boy, of about nine years of age, died of the &s;curvy, the day before the pilot came on board. That no other per&s;ons were &s;ick during the voyage, except Mr. Campan a pa&s;&s;enger, who had been indi&s;po&s;ed, before he came on board, with a lax, and other chronic complaints. That no orders were given to conceal any body, upon the arrival of the &s;hip, by the captain, from the phy&s;ician at the fort.</P>

<P>By &s;ome, the Yellow Fever, which prevailed at or near Red-bank, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have originated from an imprudent communication with the &s;hipping in the river, while others alledge, that it was derived from an intercour&s;e with the city of Philadelphia. That both the&s;e allegations, however, are equally unfounded, is a truth, which the Academy of Me|dicine conceive to be &s;atisfactorily e&s;tabli&s;hed by the following</P>

<HEAD>DOCUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I do hereby certify, that I vi&s;ited the farms at and in the vicinity of Red-bank, &s;ituated on the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the Delaware, for the purpo&s;e of inve&s;tigating the origin of the Yellow Fever, that raged &s;o violently among&s;t them, during the late autumn. I &s;ought every po&s;&s;ible information from the attending phy&s;ician, the families who had been at|tacked, and from their neighbours. Knowing that a di&s;ea&s;e of this kind might have been derived from dome&s;tic &s;ources, from the city of Philadelphia, and, po&s;&s;ibly, from the &s;hipping performing quarantine, I was exceedingly particular upon the&s;e points of en|quiry and inve&s;tigation. After examining the docu|ments upon this &s;ubject, I do not he&s;itate to pro|nounce it the offspring of local cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t valuable part of the&s;e farms con&s;i&s;ts in meadows, which had been overflowed, for ten or

twelve days, by a deluge of rain that commenced on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t. The waters gradually di&s;appeared, and depo&s;ited a &s;cum that was exceedingly nau&s;eous. The roots of the gra&s;s were dead in many places for an acre or more in extent; even &s;ix inches below the &s;urface of the earth, they were de&s;troyed&mdash;the vegeta|ble putrefaction was great, and the &s;mell ari&s;ing from it extremely di&s;agreeable. To this &s;ource I attribute the di&s;ea&s;e that prevailed among&s;t them. Twenty-nine per&s;ons were attacked in five families; but &s;o local was the calamity, that, although the neighbours kept up a con&s;tant communication, by vi&s;iting the &s;ick rooms, and rendering their &s;ervices, no per&s;on, that the&s;e families recollect, was affected with it, in con&s;e|quence. And there is but one po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e in which it could have been communicated, by any one of the&s;e families to any of the others.</P>
<P>My opinion of the local origin of the Yellow Fever, derives &s;upport from its being the idea of the Phy|&s;ician who attended the &s;ick, and the univer&s;al &s;enti|ment of tho&s;e who have &s;uffered by it. Documents, entering into detail, to e&s;tabli&s;h the&s;e, and a variety of other points connected with the di&s;ea&s;e, are &s;ub&s;cribed by all the per&s;ons alluded to, and depo&s;ited among the records of the Academy of Medicine.</P>
