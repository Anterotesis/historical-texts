<HEAD>SERMON I. The Obligation of Ju&s;tice, and its Importance to the Happi|ne&s;s of a People.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ISAIAH V.7.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And He looked for Judgment, but behold Oppre&s;&s;ion; for Righteou&s;ne&s;s, but behold a Cry.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is part of the explanation and application of a very pertinent and in&s;tructive parable; wherein, under the &s;imilitude of a vineyard, the divine tenderne&s;s and care, and <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s un|fruitfulne&s;s and danger, are plainly pointed out. <HI>My welbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill. And he fenced it, and gathered out the &s;tones thereof, and planted it with the choice&s;t vine, and built a tower in the mid&s;t of it, and al&s;o made a winepre&s;s therein: And he looked that it &s;hould bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes And now, O inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem and men of Judah judge I pray you be|twixt me and my vineyard. What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it?
<PB N="6" REF="013278_0004_0F8FB8CC2BAD4640">
Wherefore when I looked that it &s;hould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? and now, go to I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof and it &s;hall be eaten up: And break down the wall thereof and it &s;hall be trod|den down. And I will lay it wa&s;te; it &s;hall not be pruned, nor digged; but there &s;hall come up briers and thorns: I will al&s;o command the clouds, that they rain no rain upon it:</HI> As from the fir&s;t to the fifth ver&s;e.</P>
<P>From this repre&s;entation it appears, that God's an|cient people were mo&s;t highly privileged; that they had all the means of temporal and &s;piritual pro&s;perity in their hands; yet that they mi&s;improved and per|verted them; were ungrateful and di&s;obedient, and thereby provoked God to withdraw his &s;pecial pro|tection from them, and leave them expo&s;ed to wa&s;ting calamities.&mdash;That they need not fail of under&s;tanding the parable, and applying it to them&s;elves, the prophet adds, as in the ver&s;e of which our text is part; <HI>For the vineyard of the Lord of bo&s;ts is the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and the men of Judah his plea&s;ant plant: And he look|ed for judgment, but behold oppre&s;&s;ion; for righteou&s;|ne&s;s, but behold a cry.</HI></P>
<P>The words thus connected and introduced, evident|ly &s;upply us with the&s;e three topicks of di&s;cour&s;e, viz.
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That the execution of judgment, and the practice of righteou&s;ne&s;s, are what God expects and de|mands from a people. Neverthele&s;s,</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. They are &s;ometimes &s;o degenerate as, in&s;tead of judgment, to be guilty of oppre&s;&s;ion; and in&s;tead of righteou&s;ne&s;s, to occa&s;ion a cry.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="7" REF="013278_0005_0F904A029715CA40">III. When this is the ca&s;e with a people, he may ju&s;tly leave them to the fatal con&s;equences of their folly and wickedne&s;s, or &s;end other di&s;tre&s;&s;ing judgments among them.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. That the execution of judgment, and the practice of righteou&s;ne&s;s, are what God expects and demands from a people. <HI>He looked for judgment&mdash;and for righ|teou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> God had done &s;o much for his people <HI>I&s;|rael,</HI> both in an ordinary and extraordinary way, that he had all the rea&s;on in the world (&s;peaking after the manner of men) to expect that they &s;hould be a righ|teous and holy people. God, indeed, has ju&s;t rea&s;on to expect an ob&s;ervance of the laws of righteou&s;ne&s;s from every &s;ociety of rational creatures, and from every individual, &s;o far as tho&s;e laws may be known. And the greater advantages any per&s;on or people have to know and ob&s;erve tho&s;e laws, the greater is their ob|ligation to ob&s;erve them.&mdash;But this point may be il|lu&s;trated by the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the execution of judgment, and the practice of righteou&s;ne&s;s are what God expects and demands from a people, may be argued from the nature and con&s;titution of man. God manife&s;ts his will by the operations of his hands, as well as by the dictates of his word. Mankind in general &s;hew the work of the law written in their hearts; particularly the law of ju&s;tice and equity. We are born with a &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, which grows quicker and &s;tronger, as we advance in age, unle&s;s weakened, corrupted and over|borne by education and example. There is a princi|ple within us that approves of the practice of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and condemns wrong and inju&s;tice. Even &s;a|vage nations retain this &s;en&s;e, and have rules among
<PB N="8" REF="013278_0006_0F904A02B7B6D140">
them of equitable dealing. And though there are &s;ome that live by plundering and robbing their neighbours, yet they do not like to be plundered and robbed them|&s;elves, but retain among&s;t one another the practice of ju&s;tice. Now, &s;uch being the impre&s;&s;ions made on the hearts of men by the hand of their Creator, it is plain that he requires them to pre&s;erve the&s;e impre&s;&s;i|ons; to do nothing to obliterate them; to &s;quare their conduct by them; that being upright and hone&s;t in their dealings, they may an&s;wer God's rea&s;onable ex|pectations from them, by promoting the general order and felicity of the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. If we con&s;ider the moral character of the deity, as being a lover of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and hater of iniquity, and the precepts and prohibitions he has publi&s;hed, we cannot but conclude, that the execution of judgment and the practice righteou&s;ne&s;s, are what God ju&s;tly ex|pects and demands from a people. Our natural no|tions of God will not allow us to think of him as any other than an all perfect, and con&s;equently, as an in|finitely holy and righteous being: As one, who will do no wrong to any of his creatures; but, in all his tran&s;actions with them, will ob&s;erve the &s;tricte&s;t equity. To be&s;ure, this is the idea which revelation every where conveys of the divine nature and conduct. He is there &s;tiled, <HI>the ju&s;t God, the righteous Lord,</HI> &amp;c. And as to his dealing, we are a&s;&s;ured, that <HI>the judge of all the earth will do right</HI>; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xviii.25.</NOTE> that <HI>he is excellent in judgment and in plenty of justice</HI>; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job xxvii.23.</NOTE> that <HI>he will not lay upon man more than right</HI>; <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Job xxiv.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE> that <HI>he is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons; but in every nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s, is accepted of

Every per&s;on, how mean &s;oever in him&s;elf, is intitled to ju&s;tice, and no one has a right to injure him. The laws of every commu|nity &s;hould be &s;o framed, as to &s;ecure the rights of the whole; and protect the per&s;on and property of every individual, and to re&s;train and puni&s;h all acts of vio|lence and inju&s;tice. For, though by being members of &s;ociety, &s;ome part of our natural liberty is given up; yet not &s;o much of it is given up, as that any other member, or members of &s;ociety, how great &s;oever, may lawfully en&s;lave us, or deprive us of our property, we remaining innocent. Our per&s;ons and earnings are our own; and we have a right to the unmole&s;ted enjoy|ment of them; yea, we ought to be protected in the enjoyment of them, &s;o long as we remain the peace|able members of the community. It is incumbent on legi&s;lators to contrive and enact the mo&s;t equitable laws; &s;uch as are mo&s;t conducive to the &s;ecurity and pro&s;perity of the &s;tate. And when &s;uch laws are or|dained, ju&s;tice requires that they &s;hould be ob&s;erved. No individual, not the King him&s;elf, is above law, or has liberty to go contrary to, or be&s;ide the con&s;titution of the kingdom. The king of heaven <HI>exerci&s;eth judg|ment and righteou&s;ne&s;s in the earth, and deligheth,</HI> and commandeth the kings of the earth to imitate him <HI>therein.</HI> The highe&s;t human potentate has not the lea&s;t power or permi&s;&s;ion, by the laws of nature or re|velation, to do wrong, to pervert judgment and ju|&s;tice, or to injure the meane&s;t of his &s;ubjects.

<P>An in&s;pired king, and the wi&s;e&s;t of the &s;ons of men &s;ays, <HI>Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed in righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxv.5.</NOTE> When the throne is e&s;tabli&s;hed in righteou&s;ne&s;s, every edict that proceeds from it will be mild, where mildne&s;s will an&s;wer the end: And where &s;everity is nece&s;&s;ary, &s;till the laws of ju&s;tice and equity will not be violated. <HI>Ju&s;tice and judgment are the habitation of God's throne:</HI> And this is a model for earthly kings.

Puni&s;hment &s;hould never be inflicted, but when the &s;afety and be|nefit of the community require it; never, to gratify the re&s;entment and revenge of a prince, or his coun|&s;ellors; never, to awe and intimidate to unworthy &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ions.

<P>But God not only <HI>looketh for judgment</HI> from prin|ces and magi&s;trates, but for <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> al&s;o from the common people. In all their commerce with one a|nother, ju&s;tice and equity &s;hould be their invariable &s;tandard. They mu&s;t never go beyond, nor defraud one another in their dealings; never injure another in his per&s;on, property, or good name. In all their com|merce with their fellow men, they mu&s;t ob&s;erve the golden rule, <HI>What&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, do ye even &s;o to them.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. vii.12.</NOTE> It argues a corrupt and di&s;hone&s;t mind, for any to expect the exerci&s;e of ju&s;tice in others towards them&s;elves, and to practi&s;e in|ju&s;tice them&s;elves towards others. 'Tis ab&s;urd and wicked for any to conduct as if righteou&s;ne&s;s and judg|ment belonged only to rulers and judges, or were con|fined only to courts of judicature, or became obliga|tory only in con&s;equence of human laws. To refrain from injuring and wronging another; to pay every one his due; to treat every one with that tenderne&s;s, re&s;pect and deference, which his particular &s;tation, cha|racter and merit demand, are duties which primarily re&s;ult not from the laws of man, but from the laws of nature which are the laws of God. They are duties in all ages and nations, under all forms of government, and even where human e&s;tabli&s;hments were never framed. Therefore, to withhold from another his ju&s;t right, or to offer him any injury, becau&s;e there is no human authority to oblige him to pay the one, or to puni&s;h him for offering the other, is di&s;hone&s;t and un|ju&s;t.

<P N="3">3. That the execution of judgment, and the pract|ice of righteou&s;ne&s;s are what God expects and demands from a people, may be argued from the tendency of tho&s;e virtues to the happine&s;s of a people, and the con|trary tendency of oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>It is evident from the con&s;titution of man; from the furniture of his mind and the di&s;po&s;ition of his heart; from the chain of love which runs through the whole, and links man to man, and forms them into &s;ocieties; from the bountiful provi&s;ion that is made throughout the creation, for their accommodation, defence, and plea&s;ure; from all the&s;e things, as well as from reve|lation, it is evident, that the father of the univer&s;e, the great head of the &s;ocial &s;y&s;tem, con&s;ults the good and happine&s;s of human &s;ociety, and that he would have all the members of it do the &s;ame. And he hath pre|&s;cribed &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of laws, as, if duly ob&s;erved, <HI>will</HI> promote the intere&s;t of the whole.

<P>When a people are all righteous; when the rules of equity and ju&s;tice are heartily loved and practi&s;ed by all ranks of men, things mu&s;t go well in the mid&s;t of them. If kings, governors, and all &s;ubordinate magi&s;trates and rulers, are influenced by principles of integrity, how greatly conducive are they to the hap|pine&s;s of their &s;ubjects, and their own? They will not, in this ca&s;e, frame any laws but what tend to the pub|lic good. They will endeavor that "the advantages of the con&s;titution and of the laws, may extend to eve|ry branch, and to each individual in &s;ociety, of what|ever degree; that every man may enjoy his property, and pur&s;ue his hone&s;t cour&s;e of life with &s;ecurity. Such rulers will attend to the operation of their own acts, and will repeal whatever laws, upon an impartial review, they find to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the laws of God, with the rights of men, and the general benefits of &s;aints. Stability in promoting the public good, leads to a change of mea&s;ures, when the intere&s;t of a community requires it, which mu&s;t often be the ca&s;e in this mutable, im|perfect &s;tate."

<P>If rulers are pious towards GOD, and benevolent and ju&s;t towards men, it will have a happy and mo&s;t di|rect tendency to transfu&s;e a &s;pirit of piety, benevolence and ju&s;tice through the body of the people. Exam|ple is very influential, e&s;pecially in &s;uperiors.

<P>Here we may make a few brief ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is natural for the injured to complain. All the pa&s;&s;ions and &s;en&s;ations of nature, have particular ways of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves: And the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions being natural, are univer&s;ally felt and under&s;tood. External injuries, which occa&s;ion bodily pains, cau&s;e groans and cries, which are the calls of nature for pity and relief. But keener pain and di&s;tre&s;s may be felt in the mind from the ill treatment we meet with from our fellow|men; a pain from grief, anger and other pa&s;&s;ions in|termixt. And it is not more natural for a child to cry when it is hurt, than it is for the&s;e inward &s;en&s;ations to vent them&s;elves in &s;ome way of complaining. When any act of inju&s;tice is practi&s;ed upon us, we feel our&s;elves injured, we feel our&s;elves impo&s;ed on and di&s;honored; and we cannot help feeling our re&s;entments kindle, our anger ri&s;e, and our grief excited, to find any of our
<PB N="25" REF="013278_0023_0F904A13EF7838C0">
fellow-creatures di&s;covering &s;uch a ba&s;e temper, and that we are the objects upon whom they practi&s;e it. Sometimes, when the injury is great or long continu|ed, we feel the workings of revenge: We vent our pa&s;&s;ions in bitter language, in threats, if not in execra|tions; (for the pa&s;&s;ions are apt to be extravagant, and <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion will make a wi&s;e man mad</HI>) <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. vii.7.</NOTE> we utter our complaints <HI>of</HI> the injurious, if not <HI>to</HI> them: We pub|li&s;h them to men, and &s;ometimes &s;end them to heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is not only <HI>natural,</HI> but the injured have a <HI>right</HI> to complain. They have a right from the laws of na|ture, which are the laws of God. If it is fit and rea|&s;onable for any natural cau&s;e to produce its nece&s;&s;ary effect; or for any natural law to have its genuine ope|ration, then it mu&s;t be lawful and right for the pa&s;&s;ions and affections of human nature to expre&s;s them&s;elves in their natural language: Con&s;equently, the injured have a right to complain. Yea,</P>
<P N="3">3. They have not only a right to <HI>complain,</HI> but to be <HI>heard,</HI> and <HI>relieved.</HI> They have a right to be re|placed in former circum&s;tances and enjoyments; yea, in equity, a right to damages, or to be repaid for all lo&s;&s;es and &s;ufferings. Be the <HI>injurer</HI> never &s;o high in dignity, and the <HI>injured</HI> never &s;o low in degree, it al|ters not the ca&s;e. The <HI>greate&s;t</HI> has no <HI>right,</HI> though he may have <HI>power</HI> and <HI>will,</HI> to do wrong, even to the <HI>meane&s;t</HI>; and if he does, the latter has not only a right to complain, but to &s;eek redre&s;s, and to obtain it. The injured, indeed, have no right to u&s;e inde|cent language in their complaints, or improper mea|&s;ures in their endeavors to obtain relief. In a &s;tate of
<PB N="26" REF="013278_0024_0F904A14B1AA6E88">
nature, the &s;ufferer may immediately avenge him&s;elf, or make repri&s;als, upon him that did the wrong. But in &s;ociety, where there are laws and civil government, redre&s;s mu&s;t be &s;ought in a legal way. Complaint may be made to the aggre&s;&s;ors; And in ca&s;e they refu&s;e to make amends, to tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to recti|fy abu&s;es, to puni&s;h evil-doers, and to redre&s;s the in|jured.</P>
<P>"But what &s;hall be done where the controver&s;y lies betwixt the &s;upreme power, and a part of the &s;ubjects; where the former, is &s;uppo&s;ed by the latter, to di&s;tre&s;s and injure them; to encroach upon their rights and liberties?" I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to give a full an&s;wer to this que&s;tion; though I will venture to &s;ay, that an injured people have an undoubted right to complain, petition, and remon&s;trate. This, to be&s;ure, is a maxim in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> con&s;titution. "But what if all their complaints, petitions and remon&s;trances are treated with neglect and contempt? To whom &s;hall they appeal? or how &s;hall they get redre&s;s? or mu&s;t they, like <HI>a&s;&s;es,</HI> crouch down to every burden?" To this it may be re|plied, that as the &s;upreme power has no more right to deprive any of the &s;ubjects of their privileges, than one &s;ubject has to injure another, they may lawfully &s;eek redre&s;s, and ought to obtain it, and may take every method to obtain it that prudence and rea&s;on, that e|quity and the con&s;titution will ju&s;tify. When a reli|gious and loyal people are oppre&s;&s;ed, they may cer|tainly prefer their petitions to heaven, in humble hope, that, <HI>no weapon formed again&s;t them</HI> &s;hall be &s;uffered to <HI>pro&s;per</HI>; but on the contrary, that they &s;hall be di|rected and &s;upported in their endeavors to maintain, or recover their ju&s;t rights, and liberties. But with
<PB N="27" REF="013278_0025_0F904A1573CCE8F8">
regard to the lawfulne&s;s of oppo&s;ition, I choo&s;e to make u&s;e of thoughts and expre&s;&s;ions &s;uperior to my own. "It is exceeding difficult to determine exactly where &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion ends, and re&s;i&s;tance may lawfully take place, &s;o as to leave no room for men of bad minds unrea|&s;onably to oppo&s;e government, and de&s;troy the peace of &s;ociety. Mo&s;t certainly, people ought to bear much before they engage in any attempts again&s;t tho&s;e who are in authority. They ought to con&s;ider their rulers as frail and fallible men, who are liable to mi&s;|takes and faults even when their general aim is good and right. They &s;hould overlook their errors, and e|ven their vices, if they are not &s;uch as tend directly to overturn the &s;tate, and bring di&s;tre&s;s and ruin on the whole community. Better a particular per&s;on, yea many individuals &s;hould &s;uffer, than to encourage civil broils and a public di&s;turbance. But where rulers per|vert their power to tyrannical purpo&s;es; when they evidently encroach on natural and con&s;titutional rights; when they trample on tho&s;e laws which were made to limit the regal power, and defend the people, &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, if it can be avoided, is &s;o far from being a du|ty, that it is a crime. It is an offence again&s;t the &s;tate of which we are members, and who&s;e happine&s;s we ought to prefer to our chief joy. It is an offence a|gain&s;t mankind, who&s;e rights we meanly betray. It is an offence again&s;t God, who is good to all, and who has appointed government for the welfare and happi|ne&s;s, and not for the de&s;truction of his creatures." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. ELIOT'S Election Sermon.</NOTE> The injured therefore have not only a right to com|plain, but to be redre&s;&s;ed, and to make u&s;e of every con&s;titutional mea&s;ure to obtain redre&s;s. Therefore,</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="28" REF="013278_0026_0F904A163232C0F8">4. To deny them this right is a double injury and grievance. When a people have grounds to complain of uncon&s;titutional mea&s;ures in government, and of re|peated encroachments upon their privileges; and when they utter their complaints in decent language, though with that noble freedom and firmne&s;s, which a &s;en&s;e of injury, joined with a love of liberty, will in&s;pire, and in&s;tead of being heard, and encouraged, meet with only contempt and di&s;grace, how hard and injurious! And it &s;eems the harder, when we reflect, that all earthly rulers &s;hould be imitators of Him who&s;e <HI>kingdom ruleth over all,</HI> who&s;e ears are open to the petitions of every humble &s;uppliant, and who hears even <HI>the ravens when they cry.</HI></P>
<P>But this leads to a more particular con&s;ideration of the complicated &s;in in the text, which is repre&s;ented as &s;o hateful to God, and injurious to men, viz <HI>Op|pre&s;&s;ion,</HI> which occa&s;ions complaints and outcries.</P>
<P>Men in power are not guilty of oppre&s;&s;ion, when they only u&s;e that authority, which the community has entru&s;ted them with, for the general good. In|deed, kings and &s;ubordinate magi&s;trates may make an oppre&s;&s;ive u&s;e of their prerogatives and powers, if &s;o di&s;po&s;ed. But &s;o long as they keep within the bounds of the con&s;titution, and in view of the general good, in the exerci&s;e of their authority, they are not to be accu&s;ed of oppre&s;&s;ion. It is no more than their duty to exert the powers of their office to &s;uch a degree as is nece&s;&s;ary to awe the licentious and turbulent, and to pre&s;erve the &s;tate in harmony and quiet. Indeed, there is little need of exerci&s;ing authority merely for the &s;ake of commanding reverence, or enforcing obedience,
<PB N="29" REF="013278_0027_0F904A16EE73A5B8">
where rulers make it appear that their talents and di&s;|po&s;itions are equal to their &s;tations, and that, not the gratification of their own private views, but the wel|fare of the community, is their end in governing.</P>
<P>Neither is it oppre&s;&s;ion to put laws in execution a|gain&s;t ob&s;tinate offenders. Here again, the be&s;t good of the community mu&s;t be the &s;tandard. For it execu|tive officers were to con&s;true the law in the mo&s;t rigo|rous &s;en&s;e it would bear, and recognize every &s;uppo&s;ed breach of the letter of it, they might, under colour of law, greatly di&s;quiet and di&s;tre&s;s the &s;ubject. But when they only put the laws in execution for the puni&s;hment of evil-doers, and &s;hew them&s;elves <HI>God's mini&s;ters to execute wrath</HI> upon daring tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, they are to be commended for fidelity in their office.</P>
<P>Yea, where milder laws and puni&s;hments are found in|&s;ufficient, it is no part of oppre&s;&s;ion to in&s;titute <HI>&s;everer,</HI> and to put them in execution again&s;t ob&s;tinate offend|ers, who render life, liberty and property in&s;ecure.</P>
<P>And where <HI>rigor</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary for the good of the &s;tate, <HI>rigor</HI> is not oppre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;It has often been tho't nece&s;&s;ary, and therefore it has been practi&s;ed in &s;ome ca&s;es, to make examples of &s;ome leading tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, by puni&s;hing them to the utmo&s;t extent of the law, <HI>in terrorem,</HI> to &s;trike an awe into others, and deter them from the like offences. Again,</P>
<P>There may be in&s;tances wherein the innocent may be involved with the guilty, and &s;uffer with them, or on their account, and yet tho&s;e who ordered the pu|ni&s;hment not be guilty of oppre&s;&s;ion. Thus, when a man has committed trea&s;on, he not only forfeits his
<PB N="30" REF="013278_0028_0F904A17B4B360F8">
own life, but all his e&s;tate and titles to the king; and thereby his innocent family are degraded and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. And when the inhabitants of a city, or province ri&s;e up in rebellion again&s;t their lawful prince, or lawful authority, it may occa&s;ion the di&s;tre&s;s, and perhaps co&s;t the lives of many innocent per&s;ons, to reduce them to obedience.</P>
<P>Moreover, the rai&s;ing of men for the defence of a nation again&s;t a dangerous enemy, is not oppre&s;&s;ion, though many perhaps are forced away from their friends and families, and u&s;eful employments, and return no more. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, the general pre&s;ervation ab&s;orbs all private connexions and concerns.</P>
<P>Neither is levying taxes, in a con&s;titutional way, for the defreying nece&s;&s;ary public expences, to be com|plained of as oppre&s;&s;ion, though &s;uch taxes may be heavy and burden&s;ome. Government mu&s;t be &s;up|ported, and the various officers that are requi&s;ite for &s;teering, managing and &s;ecuring the political ve&s;&s;el, ought to be rewarded according to the dignity and importance of their re&s;pective &s;tations, and their fide|lity in di&s;charging the duties of them. Again,</P>
<P>There may be ca&s;es, wherein one part of the nation may be more burdened, or enjoy fewer privileges than the re&s;t, and yet neither the king nor &s;ubordinate ru|lers be guilty of oppre&s;&s;ion, Many political di&s;ad|vantages may ari&s;e from extreme di&s;tance from the centre of bu&s;ine&s;s and of government; and from other unfavorable circum&s;tances that cannot be avoided in this imperfect &s;tate. The various inhabitants of the earth, by rea&s;on of their different &s;ituations, do not e|qually enjoy the benign influences of the &s;un, and yet
<PB N="31" REF="013278_0029_0F904A18DA6EF7C0">
there is no fault in this <HI>ruler of the day.</HI> "Every large community," &s;ays the author before quoted, "is con|&s;tituted of a number of little &s;ocieties, in which there will be different branches of bu&s;ine&s;s. The&s;e, what|ever pains are taken to prevent it, will have their differ|ent connexions, and form &s;eperate intere&s;ts: It is va&s;t|ly difficult for tho&s;e that govern, to keep the balance &s;o exactly prized, as that neither part may be injured; but much more &s;o, to prevent jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions that things are carried by favor and affection."</P>
<P>Many other negative particulars might no doubt be &s;ugge&s;ted by a per&s;on ver&s;ed in politicks; but I pro|ceed to &s;ay po&s;itively,</P>
<P>Oppre&s;&s;ion in rulers may be defined, an undue u&s;e, or &s;tretch of power, to the injury of the &s;ubject.&mdash; "Whatever form of civil government men may have cho&s;en, there are certain fundamental laws which mark out and fix the chief lines and boundaries between the authority of rulers, and the liberties and privileges of the people: And tho&s;e can be no other than what are mutually agreed on, and con&s;ented to. Whatever au|thority therefore, the &s;upreme power has to make laws, to appoint officers, &amp;c. for the regulation and govern|ment of the &s;tate, being an authority derived from the community and granted by them, can be ju&s;tly exer|ci&s;ed only within certain limits, and to a certain extent, according to agreement. To &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e, and that without a delegated power, and con&s;titutional right, rulers may make laws, and appoint officers for their execution, and force them into effect, i. e. accord|ing to their own arbitrary will and plea&s;ure, is to defeat the great end of civil government." And this would be oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="013278_0030_0F904A1962102378">It is e&s;&s;ential to a free &s;tate, that no member of it &s;hall have his property taken from him by taxation, or any other way, unle&s;s by his own con&s;ent, given per&s;onally, or by his repre&s;entative. To infringe up|on this right is another in&s;tance of tyranny and op|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>'Tis a glorious privilege of <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> to be tried by their peers: To deprive them of this, is uncon&s;ti|tutional and oppre&s;&s;ive. To place courts of judicature upon &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment as to be expo&s;ed to parti|ality and corruption; or &s;o as that one contending party may have it in his power to di&s;tre&s;s, or ruin the other; to turn away the needy from their right, and prevent ju&s;tice from taking place; this would be op|pre&s;&s;ion: This would be to <HI>turn judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteou&s;ne&s;s into hemlock.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Amos vi.12.</NOTE></P>
<P>When puni&s;hments are meditated and inflicted to gratify revenge, or merely to &s;hew power and &s;uperi|ority; or when they greatly exceed the demerit of the crime; or involve a whole community in di&s;tre&s;s for the offences of a few. When acts are made and con|tinued, yea, and enforced by military power, which, in general, are con&s;idered as uncon&s;titutional and grievous; all the&s;e are in&s;tances of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is arbitrary and oppre&s;&s;ive in rulers to infringe, curtail, and annihilate as they plea&s;e, tho&s;e charter rights which were granted to a people in the mo&s;t &s;olemn and explicit manner. For if they can at plea&s;ure take away &s;uch grants without, nay, contrary to the con&s;ent, without a hearing, of the per&s;ons in their own vindica|tion
<PB N="33" REF="013278_0031_0F904A1C4A7BBB28">
to whom tho&s;e grants were made, what is there that they may not take away, &s;ince by tho&s;e grants they are &s;uppo&s;ed to hold all their liberties and all their e&s;tates?</P>
<P>Other in&s;tances of oppre&s;&s;ion in rulers might be reckoned up; but I would now ob&s;erve, as was hint|ed before, that it is not a vice peculiar to men in au|thority, but may be committed by people one among another. When people oppo&s;e the authority of their rulers, it is generally called in&s;urrection and rebellion. And when a mob a&s;&s;umes the government into their own hands, they are in danger of committing &s;uch vi|olence and outrage as are many degrees beyond the guilt and mi&s;chief of bare oppre&s;&s;ion. Yea, people, where they are not guilty of lawle&s;s riots, may combine and impo&s;e &s;uch re&s;trictions, and &s;evere conditions upon others, with intimidating threats, as &s;hew that they them&s;elves are as tyrannical, imperious and op|pre&s;&s;ive, as arbitrary rulers. In common dealings like|wi&s;e, men may oppre&s;s one another by cheating, over-reaching and taking advantage of their nece&s;&s;ities, ig|norance and &s;implicity. The rich may oppre&s;s the poor by &s;evere exactions; by taking them at di&s;tre&s;s; by harra&s;&s;ing them at law; and many other ways. Yea, people are guilty of oppre&s;&s;ion, not only by every act of trepa&s;s, fraud, and inju&s;tice; but by every de|&s;igned and needle&s;s delay of paying their ju&s;t debts, whereby damage or difficulty accrues to the creditor.</P>
<P>That the word, <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> is u&s;ed in the&s;e &s;en&s;es by the &s;acred writers, is evident from a multitude of texts, which I &s;hall leave you to recollect and peru&s;e at your lei&s;ure; only ob&s;erving, that the command to <HI>I&s;rael</HI>

like a vineyard who&s;e fence is broken down, and which has nothing to &s;ecure it from ravage and de&s;truction.

<P>It is &s;aid, that 'God helps tho&s;e that help them&s;elves.' But what can we do? Our harbour is blocked up by &s;hips of war; armed &s;oldiers, in ho&s;tile appearance, are planted in our metropolis; the trade of that once flou|ri&s;hing Town is de&s;troyed; its inhabitants greatly di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed and impoveri&s;hed; and multitudes in danger of being &s;tarved, were it not for the charity of others.

Becau&s;e we are unwilling to be on the &s;ame footing with our bre|thren and fellow-&s;ubjects in <HI>England,</HI> and refu&s;e to take up with the &s;ame privileges which they enjoy? By no means. It is not on account of all, or of any one of the&s;e rea&s;ons.

What then can be done? What &s;teps can be taken by us for our relief?

The calamities we feel, are no doubt the tokens of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t us for our &s;ins: For God does not pour out the vials of his wrath upon a people, unle&s;s to puni&s;h them for their di&s;obe|dience. Though we are unwilling to own that we have forfeited our privileges into the hands of men, yet mu&s;t we not confe&s;s, that by our ingratitude and rebel|lion again&s;t heaven, we have forfeited them all into the hands of God? Though we have been under peculiar obligations, being a free and enlightened people, to ex|erci&s;e loving kindne&s;s, judgment and righteou&s;ne&s;s in the earth; yet when God <HI>looked for judgment, hath he not beheld oppre&s;&s;ion; and for righteou&s;ne&s;s hath he not heard a cry?</HI> Have we not practi&s;ed too much of the &s;ame oppre&s;&s;ive, encroaching, tyrannical temper towards one another, which we have complained of in &s;ome of our rulers towards us?

And is it not for this that we are puni&s;hed by the diminution of them? But what|ever particular vices have provoked God to bring us low by oppre&s;&s;ion, it behoves us to be &s;incere and uni|ver&s;al in our repentance and reformation, and then we &s;hall be &s;ure of getting rid of our wor&s;t enemies.
