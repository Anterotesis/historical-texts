<P>_DAVID clo&s;ed the &s;cene of life, with that propriety of conduct, and that compo&s;ure of mind, which at once di&s;played the beauty of religion, and the dignity of human nature. When the time of his departure drew nigh, he had nothing to do to prepare for death, but only, like other pious and illu&s;trious Patriarchs, to conver&s;e with his friends, and to give them his la&s;t and be&s;t advice. And, as he had, &s;ome time before, committed to Solo|mon the care of his Family and government of his
<PB N="6" REF="020344_0004_0FAEFDE7E35EDAF8">
Kingdom; &s;o he felt a &s;trong and ardent de&s;ire, that this beloved Son, in whom he had repo&s;ed &s;uch important tru&s;ts, &s;hould appear with dignity, and act a noble and worthy part upon the &s;tage of life. Accordingly he called him into his pre&s;ence, and with equal &s;olemnity and affection, addre&s;&s;ed him in the&s;e memorable words, "I go the way of all the earth: be thou &s;trong therefore, and &s;hew thy|&s;elf a man." This appellation &s;ometimes &s;ignifies the dignity, and &s;ometimes the meanne&s;s of our nature. Job makes u&s;e of it to expre&s;s our mean|ne&s;s and turpitude in the &s;ight of God. "How can man be ju&s;tified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? Behold, even to the moon and it &s;hineth not, yea the &s;tars are not pure in his &s;ight. How much le&s;s man that is a worm, and the Son of Man which is a worm." But I&s;aiah employs this &s;ame appellative to re|pre&s;ent the dignity of human nature, when he calls upon &s;tupid idolaters to "remember this, and &s;hew them&s;elves men." So here, David in his dying addre&s;s to Solomon, "&s;hew thy&s;elf a man," evidently means to u&s;e the term in the be&s;t &s;en&s;e, and to urge him to act up to the dignity of his na|ture, and the end of his being.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="020344_0005_0FAEFDE868161D90">AGREEABLY therefore to the &s;pirit and intention of the text, the &s;ubject which now properly lies before us, is the dignity of man. And, I hope, the ob&s;ervations which &s;hall be made upon this &s;ubject, will do honour to our nature in one view, and pour contempt upon it in another, and &s;o lead us all into a clear and ju&s;t apprehen&s;ion of our|&s;elves, which is the mo&s;t u&s;eful, as well as the mo&s;t rare and high attainment in knowledge.</P>
<P>THE dignity of man appears from his bearing the <HI>image</HI> of his Maker. After God had created the heavens and the earth, and furni&s;hed the world with a rich profu&s;ion of vegetive and &s;en&s;itive na|tures, he was plea&s;ed to form a more noble and in|telligent Creature, to bear his image, and to be the lord of this lower creation. "And God &s;aid, Let us make man in our image, after our likene&s;s. And the Lord God formed man of the du&s;t of the ground, and breathed into his no&s;trils the breath of life; and man became a living &s;oul." This allows us to &s;ay, that man is the offspring of God, a ray from the fountain of light, a drop from the ocean of intelligence. Though, man, &s;ince the fall, comes into the world de&s;titute of the <HI>moral</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="020344_0006_0FAEFDE9301F4A48">
image of God, yet, in the very frame and con&s;ti|tution of his nature, he &s;till bears the <HI>natural</HI> im|age of his Maker. His &s;oul is a tran&s;cript of the <HI>natural</HI> perfections of the Deity. God is a &s;pirit, and &s;o is the &s;oul of man; God is intelligence and activity, and &s;o is the &s;oul of man. In a word, man is the living image of the living God, in whom is di&s;played more of the divine nature and glory, than in all the works and creatures of God upon earth. Agreeably therefore to the dignity of his nature, God hath placed him at the head of the world, and given him the <HI>dominion</HI> over all his works. Hence &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, "Thou ha&s;t made him a little lower than the Angels, and ha&s;t crowned him with glory and honour. Thou made&s;t him to have <HI>dominion</HI> over the works of thy hands; thou ha&s;t put all things under his feet: all &s;heep and oxen, yea the bea&s;ts of the field; the fowls of the air; and the fi&s;h of the &s;ea." How wide is the kingdom of man! how numerous his &s;ubjects! how great his dignity!</P>
<P>GOD has, be&s;ides, in&s;tamped a dignity upon man by giving him not only a rational, but an immortal exi&s;tence. The &s;oul, which is properly
<PB N="9" REF="020344_0007_0FAEFDE9B1125508">
the man, &s;hall &s;urvive the body and live forever. This might be argued from the nature, the capaci|ty, and the de&s;ires of the human mind, and from the authority of the wi&s;er Heathens, who have gen|erally &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;oul to be a &s;piritual and im|mortal principle in man. But, &s;ince the Heathen Morali&s;ts might derive their opinion from a higher &s;ource than the light of nature, and &s;ince every created object nece&s;&s;arily and &s;olely depends, for continued exi&s;tence, upon the will of the Creator; we choo&s;e to re&s;t the evidence of this point upon the authority of the &s;acred Oracles. Here indeed we find the immortality of the &s;oul &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed. Solomon &s;aith, "Who knoweth the &s;pirit of man that goeth upward, and the &s;pirit of the bea&s;t that goeth downward to the earth?" And, in another place, after de&s;cribing the frail|ty and mortality of the body, he adds, "Then &s;hall the du&s;t return to the earth as it was, and the &s;pirit &s;hall return unto God who gave it." A|greeably to this, our Lord declares that men are able to kill the body, but are not able to kill the &s;oul. And God has told us that he will, at the la&s;t day, &s;eparate the righteous from the wicked, and fix the latter in a mi&s;erable, but the former
<PB N="10" REF="020344_0008_0FAEFDEA5B7D4EC8">
in a ble&s;&s;ed immortality. Hence immortality ap|pears to be the common property and dignity of the human kind.</P>
<P>THE creatures and objects, with which we are now &s;urrounded, have but a &s;hort and momentary being. One &s;pecies of in&s;ects, we are told, begin and end their exi&s;tence in twenty-four hours. O|thers live and flutter a few hours longer, and then drop into their primitive du&s;t. The larger ani|mals, which people the air, the earth, and the &s;ea do, day after day, in a thick and con&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, die and di&s;&s;olve in their own elements. And even the whole material &s;y&s;tem will, after a few ages, either by the immediate hand of God, or by the gradual operation of the laws of nature, be rolled together as a &s;croll, and tumbled into one va&s;t and promi&s;cuous ruin. But <HI>we</HI> &s;hall &s;urvive all the&s;e ruins and ravages of time, and live the con&s;tant &s;pectators of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;cenes of Eternity. And this renders us infinitely &s;upe|rior, in point of dignity and importance, to all the objects and creatures, who&s;e exi&s;tence expires with time.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="020344_0009_0FAEFDEB2E5E4510">THE dignity of man al&s;o appears, from the great attention and regard, which God hath paid to him. God indeed takes care of all his creatures, and his tender mercies are over all his works: But man has always been the favorite child of Providence. God, before he brought him into being, provided a large and beautiful world for his habitation; and ever &s;ince the day of his crea|tion&punc; he has commanded all nature to contribute to his &s;upport and happine&s;s. For his good, he has appointed the Sun to rule the day, and the Moon to rule the night. Into his bo&s;om, he has ordered the Earth and the Sea to pour all their rich and copious ble&s;&s;ings. And for his u&s;e and com|fort, he has given the fowls of the mountains, the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;ts, and the cattle upon a thou|&s;and hills. He has al&s;o given his Angels charge over him, to keep him in all his ways. Accord|ingly they have appeared from time to time, to in|&s;truct him in duty, to deliver him from danger, to bring him good tidings, to attend his di&s;&s;olution, and to convey his departing &s;pirit to the man&s;ions of re&s;t. But, the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing and mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;play of the divine mercy, is the In|carnation and Death of the Son of God for the &s;al|vation
<PB N="12" REF="020344_0010_0FAEFDEBE7765F08">
of man. By the Incarnation of Chri&s;t, our nature was united with the divine, and the dignity of man with the dignity of Chri&s;t. Hence all the &s;ufferings, which Chri&s;t hath endured on earth, and all the honours, which he hath received in heaven, have di&s;played the dignity of man. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on, the dignity of man will be eternally ri&s;ing, with the ri&s;ing honour and dig|nity of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT, we mu&s;t furthermore ob&s;erve, that the large and noble capacities of the human mind, &s;et the dignity of our nature in the cleare&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t light. Let us therefore con&s;ider, in this place, &s;everal of the&s;e with particular attention.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> MAN hath a capacity for con&s;tant and perpetual progre&s;&s;ion in knowledge. Animals, indeed, appear to have &s;ome &s;mall degree of knowledge. "The ox knoweth his owner, and the a&s;s his ma&s;ter's crib." But, as all the lower &s;pecies are de&s;titute of the power of rea&s;oning, or the faculty of arranging and comparing their ideas; &s;o they are totally incapable of enlarging their views, by intellectual improvements. The bee
<PB N="13" REF="020344_0011_0FAEFDEC9893BF80">
cannot improve her &s;kill, nor the ant her prudence, by ob&s;ervation or &s;tudy. All their knowledge is the mere gift of God, which he be&s;tows upon them without any application or exertion of theirs.</P>
<P>BUT, man is capable of improving in know|ledge as long as he enjoys the means or materials of improvement. Indeed he has power to im|prove the &s;malle&s;t &s;tock forever. The faculty of Rea&s;on, with which he is endowed, enables him to proceed from one degree of knowledge to an|other, in a con&s;tant and endle&s;s progre&s;&s;ion. The grounds of this are obvious. As a certain chain, or connection runs through all branches of knowledge; &s;o the acqui&s;ition of one degree of knowledge facilitates the acqui&s;ition of another, and the more a man knows, the more he is capable of knowing. And, as all the powers and faculties of the mind brighten and expand by exerci&s;e; &s;o a man's capacity for improvement increa&s;es, as the means and thir&s;t for improvements increa&s;e. Ac|cordingly the path of knowledge, has re&s;embled the path of the Ju&s;t, which &s;hineth more and more unto the perfect day. One generation have been improving upon another, from age to age. And
<PB N="14" REF="020344_0012_0FAEFDED5A203B80">
the improvements and di&s;coveries of the la&s;t and pre&s;ent Century are truly &s;urprizing, and ju&s;tify this grand and bold de&s;cription,</P>
<Q><L>"Earth's di&s;embowell'd, mea&s;ured are the &s;kies,</L>
<L>"Stars are detected in their deep rece&s;s,</L>
<L>"Creation widens, vanqui&s;h'd nature yields,</L>
<L>"Her &s;ecrets are extorted, art prevails.</L>
<L>"What monuments of genius, &s;pirit, pow'r!"</L></Q>
<P>BUT to &s;how that reality in this ca&s;e &s;urpa&s;&s;es de&s;cription, let me here mention Solomon, that great man, who is addre&s;&s;ed in our text, and who&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing improvements in knowledge are re|corded by the pen of In&s;piration, for the encour|agement, as well as the in&s;truction of all future ages. "And Solomon's wi&s;dom excelled the wi&s;|dom of the Ea&s;t country, and all the wi&s;dom of Egypt. For he was wi&s;er than all men: than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the &s;ons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about. And he &s;pake three thou&s;and prov|erbs, and his &s;ongs were a thou&s;and and five. And he &s;pake of trees, from the cedar-tree that is in Lebanon, even unto the hy&s;&s;op that &s;pringeth out of the wall: he &s;pake al&s;o of bea&s;ts, and of
<PB N="15" REF="020344_0013_0FAEFDEE6D62F520">
fowls, and of creeping things, and of fi&s;hes." The children of the Ea&s;t country were the Chaldeans, who, after the flood, made the fir&s;t advances in A&s;tronomy, Philo&s;ophy and other ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ciences. Next to them the Egyptians turned their attention to Learning, and &s;oon outrivalled all other nations in literary fame. Solomon therefore &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the Prie&s;ts and Poets, all the Phy&s;icians and Hi&s;|torians, and all the Naturali&s;ts, Philo&s;ophers, and A&s;tronomers of the two mo&s;t antient, and mo&s;t re|fined nations in the world. What an exalted idea does this exhibit of his wi&s;dom and learning! And, as we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that he made the&s;e improve|ments by reading, by ob&s;ervation, and &s;tudy; &s;o he &s;tands a la&s;ting ornament of human nature, and a perpetual monument of man's capacity for con|&s;tant and endle&s;s advances in knowledge.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> MAN hath a capacity for holine&s;s as well as knowledge. The hor&s;e and mule which have no under&s;tanding, and indeed all the lower animals, are utterly incapable of holine&s;s; and even Omnipotence him&s;elf, to &s;peak with rever|ence, cannot make them holy, without e&s;&s;entially altering the frame and con&s;titution of their na|tures.
<PB N="16" REF="020344_0014_0FAEFDEF03D56A30">
But man is capable of holine&s;s. His ra|tional and moral faculties both capacitate and o|blige him to be holy. His perception and voli|tion, in connection with his rea&s;on and con&s;cience, enable him to di&s;cern and feel the <HI>right</HI> and <HI>wrong</HI> of actions, and the <HI>beauty</HI> and <HI>deformity</HI> of charac|ters. This renders him capable of doing ju&s;tly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with God. In a word, this renders him capable of every holy and virtuous affection. And, as he is capable of growing in knowledge, &s;o he is capable of grow|ing in grace, in a con&s;tant and endle&s;s progre&s;&s;ion. What a dignity does this give to man, and how near does it place him to principalities and powers above! This leads me to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THAT man hath a capacity for happine&s;s, equal to his capacity for holine&s;s and knowledge. Knowledge and holine&s;s are the grand pillars which &s;upport all true and &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s; which invariably ri&s;es or falls, accordingly as the&s;e are ei|ther &s;tronger or weaker. Knowledge and holine&s;s in the Deity are the &s;ource of all his happine&s;s. Angels ri&s;e in felicity as they ri&s;e in holine&s;s and knowledge. And &s;aints here below grow in hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="020344_0015_0FAEFDF50DC160A8">
as they grow in grace, and in the know|ledge of holy and divine objects. Of this, we have a beautiful and &s;triking in&s;tance in Solomon. View him at the Dedication of the Temple, when he fell upon his knees, and lifted up his hands and his heart to God, and poured into the ear of the divine Maje&s;ty the voice of prayer and &s;upplication, the voice of joy, of gratitude and prai&s;e. How near did he approach to God! how high did he ri&s;e in felicity! how much did he anticipate the joys of the ble&s;&s;ed! And, if we now follow him to the Temple above, where his views, his affections, and his joys are ince&s;&s;antly enlarging; we may form &s;ome faint conception of that amazing height, to which man is capable of ri&s;ing in pure and divine enjoyments. What a ve&s;&s;el of honour and dig|nity will man appear, when all his capacities for knowledge, for holine&s;s, and for happine&s;s, &s;hall be completely filled! And to all this we mu&s;t add,</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> THAT man hath a capacity for great and noble actions. Of this, we might find numer|ous monuments, if we had time to &s;urvey the land of Shinar, where Babel, Babylon, and Nine|vah &s;tood; or the land of Egypt, where &s;o many
<PB N="18" REF="020344_0016_0FAEFDF68D9599A0">
grand and co&s;tly Pyramids, Tombs, and Temples were erected; or the famous cities of Greece and of Rome, where the nobler efforts of human power and genius, have been &s;till more amply di&s;|played. But, the bounds of this di&s;cour&s;e will al|low us only to mention a few Individuals of our race, who, by their great and noble exertions, have done honour to human nature. Noah, the &s;econd Father of mankind, &s;aved the world from total extinction. Jo&s;eph pre&s;erved two nations from temporal ruin. Mo&s;es delivered the People of God from the hou&s;e of bondage, and led them through ho&s;ts of enemies and &s;eas of blood to the land of promi&s;e. David &s;ettled the kingdom of I&s;rael in peace; and Solomon rai&s;ed it to the &s;ummit of national glory. Paul, in &s;pite of Pagan &s;uper&s;tition, laws and learning, e&s;tabli&s;hed Chri&s;|tianity in the Heathen world. Luther, by the tongue and pen of controver&s;y, brought about a great and glorious revolution in the chri&s;tian Church. Newton, by his di&s;coveries in the <HI>mate|rial,</HI> and Locke, by his di&s;coveries in the <HI>intellec|tual</HI> world, have enlarged the boundaries of hu|man knowledge, and of human happine&s;s. And, to name no more, Franklin in the Cabinet, and
<PB N="19" REF="020344_0017_0FAEFDF71D3CAA38">
Wa&s;hington in the Field, have given Indepen|dence and Peace to America. But greater things than the&s;e remain to be done. The kingdom of Antichri&s;t is to be de&s;troyed, the Mahomedans are to be &s;ubdued, the Jews are to be re&s;tored, the Barbarous nations are to be civilized, the Go&s;pel is to be preached to all nations, and the whole face of things in this world, is to be beautifully and glo|riou&s;ly changed. The&s;e things are to be done by the in&s;trumentality of man. And by the&s;e, his capacity for great and noble actions, will be &s;till more illu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;played. Thus the image, which man bears of his Maker, the immortal &s;pirit which re&s;ides within him, the di&s;tingui&s;hing fa|vours, which he has received from the Father of mercies, and all his noble powers and faculties, unite to &s;tamp a dignity upon his nature, and rai&s;e him high in the &s;cale of Being.</P>
<P>IT now remains to make a few Deductions from the &s;ubject, and to apply it to the happy occa&s;ion of our pre&s;ent meeting.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> WE may ju&s;tly infer from the nature and dignity of man, that we are under indi&s;pen&s;ible
<PB N="20" REF="020344_0018_0FAEFDF7F10B38B8">
obligations to Religion. Our <HI>moral</HI> obligations to religion are interwoven with the fir&s;t principles of our nature. Our minds are &s;o framed, that we are capable of knowing, of loving, and of &s;erving our Creator; and this lays us under <HI>moral</HI> obliga|tion to wor&s;hip and obey him. Nor is there one of our race, who is incapable of feeling his <HI>moral</HI> obligations to religion. Only draw the character of the Supreme Being, and de&s;cribe his power, wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s, ju&s;tice, and mercy, before the mo&s;t ignorant and uncultivated Savage; and, as &s;oon as he under&s;tands the character of God, he will feel that he <HI>ought,</HI> that he is <HI>morally obliged</HI> to love and obey the great Parent of all. He will feel him&s;elf under the &s;ame <HI>moral</HI> obligation to pay <HI>re|ligious homage</HI> to God, as to &s;peak the truth, or to do ju&s;tice to man. Every man in the world is ca|pable of &s;eeing that the wor&s;hip of God is a rea|&s;onable &s;ervice. Religion therefore takes its ri&s;e and obligation not from the laws of Politicians, nor from the ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition of Prie&s;ts; but from the immutable laws of nature, and the frame and con&s;titution of the human mind. Hence it is utterly impo&s;&s;ible for men wholly to eradicate from their minds all &s;en&s;e of <HI>moral</HI> obligation to
<PB N="21" REF="020344_0019_0FAEFDF898985F18">
religion, &s;o long as they remain moral agents, and are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>AND, as man is formed for religion, &s;o religion is the ornament and perfection of his nature. The man of religion is, in every &s;uppo&s;able &s;ituation, the man of dignity. Pain, poverty, misfortune, &s;ickne&s;s and death, may indeed <HI>veil,</HI> but they can|not de&s;troy his dignity, which &s;ometimes &s;hines with more re&s;plendent glory, under all the&s;e ills and clouds of life. While the &s;oul is in health and pro&s;perity; while the mind is warmed with holy and religious affections, the man appears with dig|nity, whether he is in pain, or in &s;ickne&s;s, or even in the agonies of death. But, Athei&s;m and Infi|delity, with their evil offspring, &s;erve more than all other cau&s;es put together, to defile the nature, and &s;ink, the dignity of man. This appears from the black de&s;cription, which the great Apo&s;tle Paul has drawn of tho&s;e nations, who <HI>liked not to retain God in their knowledge.</HI> "They changed the glo|ry of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptibl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and to birds, and to four-footed bea&s;ts, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">eping things.

And they became of a <HI>reprobate mind,</HI> being filled with all unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s, fornication, covetou&s;ne&s;s, maliciou&s;ne&s;s; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whi&s;|perers, backbiters, haters of God, de&s;piteful, proud, boa&s;ters, inventors of evil things, di&s;obe|dient to parents, without under&s;tanding, cove|nant-breakers, without natural affection, impla|cable, unmerciful." The&s;e are things which de|file the nature, and degrade the dignity of man.</P>
<P>AND the&s;e too are prejudicial to all learning and mental improvements. The&s;e debilitate the mind, cloud the imagination, and cramp all the noble powers and faculties of the &s;oul. The&s;e degraded the Alexanders, the Pompeys, and the Cae&s;ars of the world, below the human kind. Had they been influenced by truly virtuous and religious motives, their great exertions would have done honour to human nature, but now they have &s;tain|ed the glory of all fle&s;h.

mean Noah, David, and Solomon. Solomon was at the height of his glory, when at the height of religion; but when he declined into vice and ido|latry, he fell into &s;hame and di&s;grace, and lo&s;t that dignity, which had filled the world with his fame.</P>
<P>NOW there is nothing that can wipe off from human nature the&s;e blemi&s;hes, and re&s;tore the dignity of man, but true religion. That charity which &s;eeketh not her own, that love which is the fulfilling of the law, is the e&s;&s;ence of religion and the bond of perfection. This cures the mind of Athei&s;m, Infidelity and Vice. This fills the &s;oul with noble views and &s;entiments, and directs all its powers and faculties to their proper u&s;e and end. This exalts the dignity of human nature, and &s;preads the greate&s;t glory around any human character. This rendered Noah &s;uperior to Nim|rod, Mo&s;es &s;uperior to Pharaoh, David &s;uperior to Saul, Solomon &s;uperior to Socrates, Daniel &s;uperior to the wi&s;e men of Babylon, and Paul &s;uperior to Plato, and all the Sages of the Pagan world.

gold. She is more precious than rubies; and all the things thou can&s;t de&s;ire, are not to be com|pared to her. Length of days are in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her; and happy is the man that re|taineth her." Let us all then put on this rich and beautiful ornament, and &s;hew our&s;elves men.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THIS &s;ubject may help us to a&s;certain the only proper and immutable boundaries of hu|man knowledge. I mean &s;uch boundaries of our knowledge, as ari&s;e from the frame and con&s;titu|tion of our nature, and not from any particular &s;tate or &s;tage of our exi&s;tence. Our rational powers, it is often &s;aid, are limited, and there|fore all our intellectual pur&s;uits and improvements mu&s;t be equally limited. This is doubtle&s;s true in a certain &s;en&s;e, but not in the &s;en&s;e in which it is generally under&s;tood. It appears from what has been ob&s;erved in this di&s;cour&s;e, concerning the powers and faculties of the human mind, that men are capable of making con&s;tant and eternal progre&s;&s;ion in knowledge. The only bounds
<PB N="25" REF="020344_0023_0FAEFDFCE6C9DEE0">
therefore that can be &s;et to their intellectual im|provements, mu&s;t be &s;uch as have re&s;pect to the <HI>kinds,</HI> and not to the <HI>degrees</HI> of their knowledge. There are, indeed, certain <HI>kinds</HI> of knowledge, which men are totally incapable of under&s;tanding; but the&s;e are only &s;uch <HI>kinds</HI> of knowledge, as re|quire more than <HI>created</HI> faculties to under&s;tand. For, whatever <HI>kinds</HI> of knowledge any <HI>created</HI> be|ings are capable of under&s;tanding, <HI>men</HI> are al&s;o capable of under&s;tanding, though with more dif|ficulty, and le&s;s rapidity. As Newton knew no|thing, which any man is now incapable of know|ing, in a certain time, and under certain circum|&s;tances; &s;o there is nothing, which any intelligent creatures now know, that men are incapable of knowing, in a given time, and under proper ad|vantages. The truth is, rationality is the &s;ame in all intelligent beings. Rea&s;on is the &s;ame thing in God, in Angels, and in Men. As men there|fore bear the <HI>image</HI> of God, in point of Rationa|lity; &s;o they po&s;&s;e&s;s all the <HI>rational</HI> powers and faculties, which bear any analogy to the divine intelligence; or, which can be communicated to <HI>created</HI> beings. Accordingly Angels are &s;uperior to men in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, and perhaps nearly in
<PB N="26" REF="020344_0024_0FAEFDFD27B50230">
the &s;ame degree, that Newton was &s;uperior to mo&s;t of his own &s;pecies. As Newton had no <HI>ra|tional</HI> power or faculty peculiar to him&s;elf; &s;o Angels have no rational powers or faculties which are not common to all intelligent creatures. Eve|ry man therefore is capable of learning all that any man, or any intelligent creature has learned, or can learn. Hence the only natural and nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinction between Angels and men, and between one man and another is this; that Angels are ca|pable of acquiring knowledge more ea&s;ily, and more &s;wiftly than men; and &s;ome men are capa|ble of acquiring knowledge more ea&s;ily, and more &s;wiftly than others. And this difference between Angels and men, and between man and man, to whatever cau&s;e it may be owing, will probably continue forever; and forever keep up a di&s;tinc|tion in their knowledge and improvements for the time being.</P>
<P>NOW this being a &s;ettled point, we may ea&s;ily, perhaps, fix the proper boundaries of human knowledge, or determine the proper &s;ubjects of human enquiry. It is a caveat given to men, but e&s;pecially to inqui&s;itive men, not to pry into
<PB N="27" REF="020344_0025_0FAEFDFDEBD48138">
things above their mea&s;ure. This caveat, un|doubtedly, in &s;ome ca&s;es, may be very proper and nece&s;&s;ary; but generally, I imagine, it is not only needle&s;s but ab&s;urd. For, unle&s;s men at|tempt to pry into things which &s;urpa&s;s <HI>created</HI> powers and faculties, I do not know that they tran&s;gre&s;s the boundaries of human knowledge. There are &s;ome things, which, in a moment, we know cannot be under&s;tood by <HI>creatures.</HI> And there may be many others, which, by a little at|tention, we may perceive come under the &s;ame predicament. All therefore that Divines and Metaphy&s;icians, as well as Philo&s;ophers have to do, in order to know where to <HI>begin,</HI> and, where to <HI>end</HI> their re&s;earches, is only to determine whe|ther or not, the propo&s;ed &s;ubjects require more than <HI>created</HI> abilities to inve&s;tigate them. If they do require more than <HI>created</HI> abilities, it is vain and ab&s;urd to proceed: but if they do not, we have the &s;ame grounds to proceed, that men have ever had, to attempt new di&s;coveries.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THIS &s;ubject gives us rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e, that men, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, may carry their re&s;earches into the works of nature, much
<PB N="28" REF="020344_0026_0FAEFDFE9ABC8B20">
further than they have ever yet carried them. The fields of Science, though they have been long traver&s;ed by &s;trong and inqui&s;itive minds, are &s;o &s;pacious, that many parts remain yet un|di&s;covered. There may be therefore room left in Divinity and Metaphy&s;ics, as well as in Phi|lo&s;ophy and other &s;ciences, to make large im|provements. The large and growing capacities of men, and the great di&s;coveries and improve|ments of the la&s;t and pre&s;ent Century, give us grounds to hope, that human learning and knowledge will increa&s;e from generation to gene|ration, through all the remaining periods of time. Men have the &s;ame encouragements now, that Bacon, Newton and Franklin had, to pu&s;h their re&s;earches further and further into the works of nature. It is, therefore, as groundle&s;s, as it is a di&s;couraging &s;entiment, which has been often flung out, that all the &s;ubjects of Divinity, all of human inquiry, are nearly exhau&s;ted, and that no great di&s;coveries or improvements, at this time of day, are either to be expected or attempted. The pre&s;ent Generation have &s;uperior advantages, which, with capacities no more than equal to their Fathers, may enable them to &s;urpa&s;s all who
<PB N="29" REF="020344_0027_0FAEFDFFF0313C08">
have gone before them in the paths of Science. Let this thought rou&s;e their attention, and awaken their exertions, to &s;hew them&s;elves men.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> THE ob&s;ervations, which have been made upon the noble powers and capacities of the human mind, may embolden the Sons of Science to aim to be Originals. They are &s;trong enough to go alone, if they only have &s;ufficient courage and re&s;olution. They have the &s;ame capacities and the &s;ame original &s;ources of knowledge, that the Antients enjoyed. All men are as capable of thinking, of rea&s;oning, and of judging for them|&s;elves in matters of Learning, as in the common affairs and concerns of life. And would men of Letters enjoy the plea&s;ures of knowledge, and render them&s;elves the mo&s;t &s;erviceable to the world, let them determine to think and judge for them&s;elves. Their progre&s;s may perhaps, in this way, not be &s;o rapid; yet it will be much more entertaining and u&s;eful. When I &s;ay their pro|gre&s;s may not be &s;o rapid, I mean with re&s;pect to tho&s;e only, who po&s;&s;e&s;s moderate abilities; for as to tho&s;e of &s;uperior powers, they will make much &s;wifter progre&s;s by going alone out of the common,
<PB N="30" REF="020344_0028_0FAEFE0019FD2708">
beaten track. The way to out&s;trip tho&s;e who have gone before us, is not to tread in their &s;teps, but to take a nearer cour&s;e. What Philo&s;opher can expect to overtake Newton, by going over all the ground, which he travelled? What Divine can expect to come up with Mede, Baxter, or Ed|wards, while he pur&s;ues their path? Or, what Poet can hope to tran&s;cend Homer and Milton, &s;o long as he &s;ets up the&s;e men as the &s;tandards of perfection? If the Moderns would only employ Nature's powers, and conver&s;e freely and fami|liarly with Nature's objects, they might ri&s;e above the Antients, and bear away the Palm from all who have gone before them in the walks of Science.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> WHAT has been &s;aid concerning the nature and dignity of man, &s;hows us, that we are under indi&s;pen&s;able obligations to cultivate and improve our minds in all the branches of human knowledge. All our natural powers are &s;o many talents, which, in their own nature, lay us under <HI>moral</HI> obligation to improve them to the be&s;t ad|vantage. Being men, we are obliged to act like men, and not like the hor&s;e or the mule which
<PB N="31" REF="020344_0029_0FAEFE00CC07A2B8">
have no under&s;tanding. Be&s;ides, knowledge, next to religion, is the brighte&s;t ornament of human nature. Knowledge &s;trengthens, enlarges, and &s;oftens the human &s;oul, and &s;ets its beauty and dignity in the faire&s;t light. Learning hath made a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;tinctions among the different nations of the earth. Tho&s;e nations, who have lived un|der the warm and enlightening beams of &s;cience, have appeared like a &s;uperior order of beings, in compari&s;on with tho&s;e, who have dragged out their lives under the cold and dark &s;hades of ig|norance. The Chaldeans and Egyptians, as well as the Greeks and Romans, while they cultivated the arts and &s;ciences, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, in dignity and glory, all their ignorant and barbarous neighbours. Europe, &s;ince the re&s;urrection of Letters in the &s;ixteenth Century, appears to be peopled with a &s;uperior &s;pecies. And the pre&s;ent Inhabitants of North-America owe all their &s;uperiority to the Aboriginals, in point of dignity, to the cultiva|tion of their minds in the civil and polite arts. Learning has al&s;o pre&s;erved the Names, Cha|racters, and mighty Deeds of all antient nations from total oblivion. A few learned men in each nation, have done more to &s;pread their national
<PB N="32" REF="020344_0030_0FAEFE040AE352B0">
fame, than all their Kings and Heroes. The boa&s;ted glory of Britain is more to be a&s;cribed to her Newtons, her Lockes, and her Addi&s;ons, than to all her Kings, and Fleets, and Conquerors.</P>
<P>BUT the cultivation and improvement of the mind is more nece&s;&s;ary for u&s;e, than for orna|ment. We were made for u&s;efulne&s;s and not for amu&s;ement. We were made to be the &s;ervants of God, and of each other. We were made to live an active, diligent, and u&s;eful life. As men there|fore we cannot reach the end of our being, with|out cultivating all our mental powers, in order to furni&s;h our&s;elves for the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;ervice in our day and generation. Knowledge and learning are u&s;eful in every &s;tation; and in the higher and more important departments of life, they are ab|&s;olutely and indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>PERMIT me now, therefore, My Hearers, to &s;ug|ge&s;t &s;everal things, which may &s;erve to excite you to improve your minds in every branch of u&s;eful knowledge which, either your callings, or your circum&s;tances require.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="020344_0031_0FAEFE05B32A05C0">I AM happy to congratulate you, my Country|men, that we live in an age, which is favourable to mental and literary improvements.

In &s;uch an age, the minds of men are &s;trong and vigorous, being nei|ther enfeebled by luxury, nor &s;hackled by author|ity. At &s;uch an happy period, we have come upon the &s;tage, with the fields of &s;cience before us opened but not explored. This &s;hould rou&s;e our dormant faculties, and call up all our latent powers in the vigorous pur&s;uit of knowledge. Tho&s;e, who have gone before us in the&s;e pur&s;uits, have only &s;et us an example, and facilitated our progre&s;s, without damping our hopes, or forbidding our &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>AGAIN, we live under that Form of government, which has always been the friend of the Mu&s;es, and parent and nur&s;e of Arts. It was while Greece and Rome were free, republican States, that Learn|ing there &s;prang up, flouri&s;hed, and ro&s;e to its height; and enrolled their Names in the annals of Fame. Liberty, which is the birth-right of man, and congenial with his nature, ennobles and exalts the mind; in&s;pires it with great and &s;ublime &s;en|timents;
<PB N="34" REF="020344_0032_0FAEFE0705D6D3C8">
and, at the &s;ame time invites and encour|ages its highe&s;t exertions, with hopes of &s;ucce&s;s and the promi&s;es of reward. For, in free Repub|lics, where liberty is equally enjoyed, every man has weight and influence in proportion to his abil|ities, and a fair opportunity of ri&s;ing, by the dint of merit, to the fir&s;t offices and honours of the State.</P>
<P>ANOTHER motive to improvement, you will al|low me to &s;ay, may be taken from your pa&s;t &s;in|gular and laudable efforts to cultivate and diffu&s;e u&s;eful knowledge in this place. It is now more than Thirty years, &s;ince this &s;ingle and then &s;mall Congregation collected a very con&s;iderable Pari&s;h-Library, in order to improve their minds in u&s;e|ful and divine knowledge. This was &s;uch an ef|fort to promote mental improvements as, I im|agine, cannot be ea&s;ily found in this Country. The benefit of this Library you have all perhaps more or le&s;s experienced; and, to its happy in|fluence owe, in a mea&s;ure, your general Charac|ter as a Religious and Intelligent People. May this con&s;ideration have all its weight upon you, &s;ince our Lord hath &s;aid in the Parable of the Tal|ents, "Who&s;oever hath, to him &s;hall be given, and he &s;hall have more abundance."</P>

Nor can you neglect or abu&s;e &s;uch advantages, with|out drawing upon your&s;elves the reproach of the world, and which is infinitely more, the reproach of your own con&s;ciences.

<P><PB N="36" REF="020344_0034_0FAEFE08588A1AC0">THERE are three grand &s;ources of knowledge be|fore you, Nature, Men, and Books. Attentively read each of the&s;e great Volumes.</P>
<P>READ Nature, which is truly an original au|thor. King David, &s;tudying this large and in|&s;tructive volume, which filled his mind with the noble&s;t views and &s;entiments, broke forth in a rapture of prai&s;e, "The heavens declare the glo|ry of God; and the firmament &s;heweth his handy work. Day unto day uttereth &s;peech, and night unto night &s;heweth knowledge."</P>
<P>READ Men. "For as in water face an&s;wereth to face, &s;o the heart of man to man." This vol|ume David peru&s;ed and dige&s;ted in the Court and Camp of Saul, where human nature, with, and without a veil, was very vi&s;ible to his critical and di&s;cerning eye.</P>
<P>BUT the de&s;ign of this di&s;cour&s;e more directly leads me to urge the reading of Books in particu|lar. The&s;e are a grand magazine of knowledge, and contain the Learning and Wi&s;dom of ages. But, you mu&s;t know, that Books are a peculiar fountain, from whence may be drawn either <HI>&s;weet</HI> waters or <HI>bitter,</HI> the waters of <HI>life,</HI> or the waters of

<HI>death.</HI> For this rea&s;on, you will allow me here to advi&s;e you, to take heed <HI>how</HI> you read.</P>
<P>AND, in the fir&s;t place, read with Caution. A per&s;on may be undone by a &s;ingle volume. Noth|ing contains &s;uch &s;ecret and fatal poi&s;on as Books. Though they profe&s;s a kind and friendly intention, yet they often bite like a &s;erpent and &s;ting like an adder. Be careful what books you read. There are many, which the young and inexperienced at lea&s;t, &s;hould totally avoid. In this particular, if you are wi&s;e, and faithful to your&s;elves, you will endea|vour to obtain and follow good advice.</P>
<P>READ with Judgment. This is, in every view, indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary, in order to read to advan|tage. This will enable you to di&s;cover and a&s;|certain the main object of your Author, which will be a key to all he &s;ays in the various parts and branches of his &s;ubject. This will help you to di&s;tingui&s;h truth from error, good &s;entiments from bad, and &s;ound rea&s;oning and &s;trict demon&s;tration, from mere conjectures and bold a&s;&s;ertions. But if you read without judgment, you will be in danger of imbibing error as well as truth, of always believ|ing the la&s;t Author you read, and of never having any fixed and &s;ettled &s;entiments of your own.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="020344_0036_0FAEFE09DB0363D8">READ for U&s;e and not for Amu&s;ement. The time is wor&s;e than thrown away, which is &s;pent in reading for amu&s;ement, without any particular end or object in view. We &s;hould be careful how we take up a Book, e&s;pecially, if it be an enter|taining one, with which we have no particular concern; for it will require a con&s;iderable effort of the mind to throw it a&s;ide, and if we do not throw it a&s;ide it will &s;teal away our time, and prevent our being better employed. Almo&s;t any book, if read for u&s;e, may be of advantage. We may read amu&s;ing, and, even corrupting books to advantage, if we read them in order to make a good u&s;e of them. The bee can &s;uck honey from the &s;ame flowers, from which other in&s;ects &s;uck poi&s;on. But we may read all our lives to very little purpo&s;e, if we read every book which hap|pens to fall in our way for amu&s;ement and not for u&s;e. We &s;hould always read with reference, ei|ther to our own particular profe&s;&s;ion, or to the particular &s;tate and &s;ituation of our own minds. When we read with either of the&s;e objects in view, we &s;hall be apt both to under&s;tand and dige&s;t what we read. There is great and &s;ingular ad|vantage in reading proper books at a proper time, when we really &s;tand in need of them. This is
<PB N="39" REF="020344_0037_0FAEFE0AB8C5C870">
of the &s;ame happy tendency, as eating and drink|ing at the proper &s;ea&s;ons, when it &s;erves to nour|i&s;h and &s;trengthen, in&s;tead of clogging and &s;ur|feiting the body.</P>
<P>READ with Patience. Many Authors are both prolix and ob&s;cure in conveying their ideas; and after-all, have much more chaff than wheat in their writings. In reading &s;uch, we mu&s;t go over a great deal of ground in order to reap a &s;mall har|ve&s;t of ideas. It is difficult, however, for any man to treat any &s;ubject in a method entirely new. We mu&s;t expect therefore to find many common and familiar thoughts in every Author, which we mu&s;t patiently read, if we would <HI>properly</HI> come at tho&s;e which are more new, entertaining and in&s;truc|tive. And for this rea&s;on it is generally be&s;t per|haps, if Authors are of any tolerable &s;ize, to read them through, with patience and attention. This is but ju&s;tice to them, and prudence to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>READ with Confidence. In our fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays af|ter knowledge, we are obliged, by the laws of our nature, to depend upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and in&s;truction of others, and in con&s;equence of this, we are apt to feel, through life, too great a &s;en&s;e of our own weakne&s;s and imbecility, and to de&s;pair of going a
<PB N="40" REF="020344_0038_0FAEFE0B55AE3390">
&s;tep further than we are led. This, however is very unfriendly to all improvement by reading. We ought therefore to feel that we are men, and place a proper degree of confidence in our own &s;trength and judgment. We ought to fix it in our minds that we are capable of improvement. Such a confidence in our&s;elves as this, will em|bolden us to read with a view not only of under|&s;tanding, but of improving upon the Authors we read. Very few Authors have exhau&s;ted the &s;ub|jects upon which they have treated, and therefore have generally left us ample room to improve upon what they have written. And by reading with this view, if we fail of improving upon tho&s;e we read, we &s;hall, however, more clearly and fully under&s;tand <HI>their</HI> meaning, and more thoroughly make <HI>their</HI> ideas and &s;entiments our own.</P>
<P>YET, at the &s;ame time, every one &s;hould read with Humility. Reading, more than any other method of improvement, is apt to puff up the mind with pride and &s;elf-conceit. For, per&s;ons of reading are very prone to e&s;timate their know|ledge more according to the number of books which they have read, than according to the num|ber of ideas which they have collected and dige&s;t|ed.

And &s;o are ready to imagine, that they have engro&s;&s;ed to them&s;elves all knowledge; though, in reality, they have not read enough, to learn their own ignorance. This &s;hould teach us to take the Poet's advice.</P>

Do not Phy&s;icians and Attorneys, by reading a few books in Divin|ity, &s;ometimes fancy them&s;elves ma&s;ters of that &s;acred and &s;ublime &s;cience? And, on the other ex|treme, do not Divines, by reading a few books in Law and Phy&s;ic, &s;ometimes fancy them&s;elves ma&s;|ters of tho&s;e two learned profe&s;&s;ions? But this is rank pedantry. It is an ea&s;y matter to gain a &s;u|perficial acquaintance with the general objects of &s;cience; but it is a laborious ta&s;k to acquire a deep and thorough acquaintance with any &s;ingle branch of knowledge. It is ea&s;y to know <HI>&s;omething</HI> about <HI>every thing</HI>; but it is difficult to know <HI>every thing</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="020344_0040_0FAEFE0CD5612CD0">
about <HI>any thing.</HI> If men of reading would collect the whole &s;tock of their knowledge, and the whole force of their genius more to a point, and aim to be complete ma&s;ters of their own profe&s;&s;ions; they would become at once, much le&s;s pedantic, and much more u&s;eful to the world. Many men of real abili|ties and learning, have defeated their own u&s;efulne&s;s, by attempting to know, and to do too much.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t place, read <HI>prayerfully.</HI> "If any of you lack wi&s;dom, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, let him a&s;k of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraid|eth not; and it &s;hall be given him." This Solo|mon found to be true, by happy experience. "In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God &s;aid, A&s;k what I &s;hall give thee. And Solomon &s;aid, Thou ha&s;t &s;hewed un|to thy &s;ervant David my father great mercy, ac|cording as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and in uprightne&s;s of heart with thee; and thou ha&s;t kept for him this great kind|ne&s;s that thou ha&s;t given him a &s;on to &s;it on his throne, as it is this day. And now, O Lord my God, thou ha&s;t made thy &s;ervant king in&s;tead of David my father; <HI>and I am but a child; I know not how to go out or come in.</HI> And thy &s;ervant is in
<PB N="43" REF="020344_0041_0FAEFE0E4613D4F8">
the mid&s;t of thy people which thou ha&s;t cho&s;en, a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. <HI>Give therefore thy &s;ervant an under|&s;tanding heart</HI>; to judge thy people, that I may di&s;|cern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy &s;o great a people? <HI>And the &s;peech plea&s;ed the Lord, that Solomon had a&s;ked this thing.</HI> And God &s;aid unto him, Becau&s;e thou ha&s;t a&s;ked this thing, and ha&s;t not a&s;ked for thy&s;elf long life; neither ha&s;t a&s;ked riches for thy&s;elf, nor ha&s;t a&s;ked the life of thine enemies, but ha&s;t a&s;ked for thy&s;elf <HI>under|&s;tanding</HI> to di&s;cern judgment; behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee <HI>a wi&s;e and under&s;tanding heart."</HI> It was Dr. Dod|dridge, I think, who never u&s;ed to take up a new book to read, without an ejaculatory prayer for di|vine influence and direction. This example is worthy of univer&s;al imitation. Let us therefore always accompany our e&s;&s;ays after knowledge with a humble and prayerful &s;pirit; and then we may hope to read and &s;tudy with &s;afety and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>TO all the&s;e directions, I might now add, Dili|gence and Per&s;everance, which always have had, and always will have, a mighty influence, in all the great things done by mankind. But I &s;hall only
<PB N="44" REF="020344_0042_0FAEFE0F998BEEA8">
add a few words to tho&s;e, who are very immedi|ately and deeply intere&s;ted in the things which have been &s;aid in this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ubject calls upon Parents in particular, to &s;hew them&s;elves men. You are, my re&s;pectable Hearers, men in years, be men al&s;o in virtue, in religion, and in under&s;tanding. Let the dignity of man appear in all your conduct, and e&s;pecially in your conduct towards your children. Let them &s;ee the dignity of human nature exemplified before their young and attentive minds. They are every day, and every hour, watching your conduct, and looking up to you for example and in&s;truction. Take heed, that none of your words, none of your actions, none of your pur&s;uits, be unworthy of men. But, let all your conver&s;ation and behaviour be &s;uch as your children may follow with propriety, with &s;afety, and dignity. And while you are teaching them by example, teach them al&s;o by pre|cept. Give them good in&s;truction; and for this purpo&s;e, provide them good in&s;tructors. The&s;e are of great importance to your children, who&s;e pro|gre&s;s in knowledge, will generally bear a very ex|act proportion to the abilities and fidelity of their Teachers. The education of children has always
<PB N="45" REF="020344_0043_0FAEFE102CC2A9F8">
been an object of great attention among all wi&s;e nations, and e&s;pecially among all wi&s;e and good Parents. Let this then be the object of your at|tention. Con&s;ider the dignity of man. Con&s;ider the worth of the &s;oul. Con&s;ider the rich and inva|luable trea&s;ure put into your hands. Con&s;ider how much the dignity and happine&s;s of your children both in time and in Eternity, depend upon your care and fidelity. And let the ties of nature, the authority of God, and your own &s;olemn vows, en|gage you to bring them up in the nurture and ad|monition of the Lord, and to cultivate and em|belli&s;h their opening minds in every branch of u&s;eful and ornamental knowledge. Admit not the thought, that &s;uch little, &s;uch weak, and to ap|pearance, &s;uch u&s;ele&s;s creatures, are of &s;mall im|portance; but remember that they are men in miniature, and may, one day, &s;urprize the world with their dignity. When a young Prince is born, all the Kingdom feel the importance of his educa|tion, and are anxiou&s;ly concerned to have the able&s;t in&s;tructors employed, to form him for great and noble actions. But you have more than Princes, even young Immortals, committed to your care, who&s;e powers and capacities, who&s;e dignity and importance, will a&s;toni&s;h you, at the great Day, if
<PB N="46" REF="020344_0044_0FAEFE1385C89F10">
not before. How happy will that parent be, who &s;hall then be found to have been faithful to his children! "He will then join, as a celebrated Writer ob&s;erves, his virtuous offspring in the ha|bitations of the ju&s;t, and there &s;ee them ri&s;e up and call him ble&s;&s;ed. But if a parent neglects his duty to his children; if he &s;ets before them an example of irreligion, and &s;uffers them to grow up loo&s;e and unprincipled, he may expect that their blood will be required at his hands, and he &s;hould tremble to think of that period of retribution, when pro|bably they will cur&s;e him for that negligence which has ruined them."</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> LET this &s;ubject awaken the attention of the Youth, to the dignity of their nature and the end of their being. My dear young Friends, you will &s;oon be called to act your various parts upon the &s;tage of life. You are now the Hope of your Parents, of your Pa&s;tors, and of your Country. The eyes of the world are upon you. Be entreated then to cultivate all your noble powers, and to &s;hew your&s;elves men, in whatever departments of life, divine Providence &s;hall place you. Piety and Knowledge will prepare you for a u&s;eful and honourable life, and for a peaceful
<PB N="47" REF="020344_0045_0FAEFE139F6B1B28">
and triumphant death. Let the&s;e then be the &s;upreme objects of your pur&s;uit. Early con&s;e|crate all your time and all your talents to the &s;er|vice of God, and of your fellow-men. Seek for knowledge, as for &s;ilver, and &s;earch for it, as for hid trea&s;ures; and &s;acrifice every object which ob&s;tructs your pur&s;uit of it. "Through de&s;ire a man having <HI>&s;eparated him&s;elf,</HI> &s;ays Solomon, &s;eek|eth and intermeddleth with all wi&s;dom." If you would make progre&s;s in learning, and ri&s;e to any di&s;tingui&s;hing degrees of knowledge, you mu&s;t &s;eparate your&s;elves from the vanities of youth, and devote tho&s;e vacant hours to mental improve|ments, which, too many of your age trifle away in folly and vice. In particular, flee youthful lu&s;ts, which war again&s;t both the body and the mind. Shun that all-devouring mon&s;ter, Intem|perance, by which &s;o many <HI>&s;trong minds</HI> have been ca&s;t down and de&s;troyed. Avoid bad company and unmanly diver&s;ions, which are an inlet to every vice. Hold in &s;teady contempt, <HI>Beaus</HI> and <HI>Fops,</HI> tho&s;e butterflies which live upon the filth and dregs of the earth. Diogenes walking the &s;treets of Athens at noon-day with a lanthorn in his hand; and being a&s;ked, as he intended to be, what he was &s;earching after, tartly replied, "I am
<PB N="48" REF="020344_0046_0FAEFE15A8E30E68">
looking for Men." A &s;evere &s;atire upon the lux|ury and effeminacy of that once manly and vir|tuous People. The dignity of man appears in the ornaments of the mind, and not in tho&s;e of the body. Seek therefore to adorn and embelli&s;h your minds both by reading and ob&s;ervation, and your gifts and abilities will make room for you, and bring you before great men. You have pe|culiar advantages and encouragements to animate you to great and noble exertions. <HI>Therefore &s;et your Mark of intellectual attainments as high as you plea&s;e, and, according to the common cour&s;e of events, you will, by uniformity, diligence, and per&s;everance, infallibly reach it.</HI> Your generous Benefactor hath &s;et you an example, as well as given you the means of intellectual improvements. That Great Man, in the morning of life, was &s;urrounded with uncommon difficulties and embarra&s;&s;ments, but by the mere dint of genius and of application, he &s;urmounted every ob&s;tacle thrown in his way, and by his rapid and a&s;toni&s;hing progre&s;s in know|ledge, he hath ri&s;en, &s;tep by &s;tep, to the fir&s;t of|fices and honours of his Country, hath appeared with dignity in the Courts of Britain and of France, and now fills more than half the globe with his Fame. Keep this illu&s;trious example in your eye, and &s;hew your&s;elves men.</P>
