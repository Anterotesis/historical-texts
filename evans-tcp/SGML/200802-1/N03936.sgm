<P><HI>Friday, October</HI> 31. Met with a bitter Pamphlet wrote again&s;t me by &s;ome of the Presbyterian Per&s;ua&s;ion, and found Freedom given me to an&s;wer it. I long &s;ince ex|pected clo&s;e Oppo&s;ition from that Quarter. I believe it will be increa&s;ing daily. The Lord will make me more than Conqueror thro' his Love! Met al&s;o with two Vo|lumes of Sermons publi&s;hed in <HI>London</HI> as delivered by me, tho' I never preach'd on mo&s;t of the Texts. But <HI>Satan</HI> mu&s;t try all Ways to bring the Work of God into Contempt. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, who enables me abundantly to rejoice in all Things that befal me. Preached in the Morning at Mr <HI>P&mdash;n's</HI> Meeting-Hou&s;e: But never &s;aw the Word of God fall with &s;uch Weight in <HI>New-York</HI> before. Two
<PB N="5" REF="004853_0004_100E02662FBA3F18">
or three cried out. Mr. <HI>Noble</HI> could &s;carce refrain him&s;elf. And, look where I would, many &s;eem'd deeply wounded. At Night the Word was attended with great Power. One cried out; and the Lord enabled me, at the latter End of my Sermon, to &s;peak with Authority. Alas! How vain are the Thoughts of Men! As I came along Ye&s;terday, I found my Heart &s;omewhat dejected, and told Mr. <HI>Noble</HI> I expected but little Movings in <HI>New York</HI>; but Mr. <HI>Noble</HI> bid me
"expect great Things from God,"
and likewi&s;e told me of &s;everal who were, as he hoped, &s;avingly wrought upon by my Mini&s;try, when there la&s;t. <HI>O Lord, let the&s;e Things humble my Soul for thy own Name's Sake</HI>!</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, November</HI> 1. Fini&s;hed my An&s;wer to the Pamphlet. God enabled me to write it in the Spirit of Meekne&s;s. <HI>O Lord give it thy Ble&s;&s;ing</HI>! Preached twice as Ye&s;terday to very crowded Auditories, and neither Time without Power. In the Evening Exerci&s;e, &s;ome fainted, and the Lord &s;eemed to &s;hew us more and more, that a Time for favouring <HI>New-York</HI> was near at Hand. <HI>O wherefore did I doubt! Lord increa&s;e my Faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, November</HI> 2. Preached this Morning with Free|dom and &s;ome Power, but was much dejected before the Evening Sermon. For near half an Hour before I left Mr. <HI>Noble</HI>'s Hou&s;e, I could only lie before the Lord and &s;ay,
<Q>I was a poor Sinner, and wonder that Chri&s;t would be gracious to &s;uch a Wretch.</Q>
As I went to Meeting, I grew weaker and weaker, and when I came into the Pulpit, I could have cho&s;e to be &s;ilent rather than &s;peak. But, after I had begun, the Spirit of the Lord gave me Freedom, till at length it came down like a mighty ru&s;h|ing Wind, and carried all before it. Immediately the whole Congregation was alarmed. Shricking, Crying, Weeping and Wailing were to be heard in every Corner. Men's Hearts falling them for Fear and many falling into the Arms of their Friends. My Soul was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> I could &s;carce &s;peak any more. A Sen&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

overwhelmed me. As I went down, a Woman &s;aid,
"Come and &s;ee wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God has done for me To-night."
I looked, and her Daughter, in a great Agony, was cry|ing out,
"Oh my Je&s;us, my Je&s;us!"
Another, a lit|tle Boy, was &s;o concerned on the Pulpit Stairs, that he could &s;carce &s;tand. One of my Friends asked him why he cried,
<Q>Who can help it? &s;aid he. Mr. <HI>White|field's</HI> Words cut me to the Heart.</Q>
After I came home, I threw my&s;elf upon the Bed, and in an awful Silence, admired the infinite Freene&s;s, Sovereignty and Conde&s;cen&s;ion of the Love of God. I was unwilling to move, but was called down to the Marriage of Mr. <HI>B&mdash;r,</HI> whom I met at <HI>Rhode I&s;land,</HI> who being e&s;pou&s;ed to the young Woman, who was &s;o &s;truck at the &s;ame Place, by my Advice, married her this Night, and both are going as my A&s;&s;i&s;tants to <HI>Georgia.</HI> Never did I &s;ee a more &s;olemn Wedding. Je&s;us Chri&s;t was called, and he was pre&s;ent in a remarkable Manner. After Mr. <HI>P&mdash;n</HI> had mar|ried them, I prayed. But my Soul, how was it enabled to wre&s;tle with and lay hold on God! I was in a very great Agony, and the Holy Gho&s;t was remarkably pre|&s;ent, that mo&s;t, I believe, could &s;ay, <HI>Surely God is in this Place</HI>! After this, Divine Manife&s;tations flowed in &s;o fa&s;t, that my frail Tabernacle was &s;carce able to &s;u&s;tain them. My dear Friends &s;at round me on the Bed-&s;ides. I pray|ed for each of them alternately with &s;trong Cries, and pierced by the Eye of Faith, even within the Veil. I continued in this Condition for about half an Hour, a&s;to|ni&s;hed at my own Vilene&s;s, and the Excellency of Chri&s;t, then ro&s;e full of Peace, and Love and Joy. Oh! how am I obliged to my Enemies; God has remarkably re|vealed him&s;elf to my Soul, ever &s;ince I have &s;een the Pam|phlet publi&s;hed by the Presbyterians again&s;t me. O how faithful is he that promi&s;ed, <HI>It &s;hall brui&s;e thy Heel, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his Head! Lord enable me to lay hold on this, during the Time of my &s;ojourning here on Earth.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Tue&s;day, Nov.</HI> 4. Preached from a Waggon on <HI>Staten I&s;land,</HI> to about 3 or 400 People. The Lord came among&s;t them. One dear young Man, in particular, as tho' his very Heart-&s;trings would break, came to me after Ser|mon, with &s;trong Cryings and Tears, be&s;eeching me,
<Q>to pray that he might be converted.</Q>
Many others wept al&s;o, and &s;everal of God's Children felt the Pre&s;ence of the dear Lord Je&s;us in their Hearts. Many of them rejoiced to &s;ee me again. One grey headed Man came and told me how God had brought him from Darkne&s;s to Light, when I was here la&s;t. My Soul was al&s;o much refre&s;hed with the Sight of dear Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennent</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cro&s;s.</HI> The former has lately lo&s;t his Wife, and tho' dear unto him, yet he was enabled with great Calmne&s;s to preach her funeral Sermon, whil&s;t the Corps were lying before him.

in many Places. Mr. <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> al&s;o has &s;een great and won|derful Things in his Congregations, &s;o great that when I came to de&s;ire a particular Account, he &s;aid,
<Q>It directly an&s;wered the Account given by Mr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> of the Work of God in <HI>Northampton.</HI></Q>
<HI>What is the Lord Je&s;us about to do! If the Beginning is &s;o great, what will the End of the&s;e Things be</HI>! Rode after Sermon to <HI>Newark,</HI> about ten Miles from <HI>Staten I&s;land.</HI> Preached to a con&s;i|derable Congregation, but it being dark before I con|cluded, I could not &s;ee what Impre&s;&s;ions the Di&s;cour&s;e made. I fear but little. However, at Night the Lord manife&s;ted forth his Glory. For coming down to Family Prayer, where I lodged, and perceiving many young Men around me, my Soul was, as it were melted down with Concern for them. After &s;inging, I gave a Word of Exhortation. With what Power none can fully ex|pre&s;s but tho&s;e that &s;aw it. O how did the Word fall like a Hammer and like a Fire! What a Weeping was there! One poor Creature in particular was ready to &s;ink into the Earth. His Countenance was altered, till he look'd, as it were, &s;ick to Death. At length he &s;aid,
"What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?"
Others were di&s;&s;olved into Tears around him; and one of my Fellow-travellers was &s;truck down, and &s;o overpowered, that his Body be|come exceeding weak. He could &s;carce move all the Night after. God, I believe, was now working power|fully on his Soul. As for my own Part, I was almo&s;t &s;pent. I vomited, threw my&s;elf upon the Bed, humbled my&s;elf before God, and &s;pent the Remaining Evening in hear|ing dear Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> give an Account of his late Ex|cur&s;ion.

<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, Nov.</HI> 5. Set out about eight in the Morning. Got to <HI>Baskinridge,</HI> the Place where Mr. <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> exerci&s;es
<PB N="9" REF="004853_0008_100E026D6FF14CD8">
his &s;tated Mini&s;try, about one o'Clock. At the Hou&s;e where I waited in the Way, a Woman &s;poke to me, un|der &s;trong Convictions, and told me,
<Q>&s;he was deeply wounded by my la&s;t Night's Di&s;cour&s;e</Q>
When I came to <HI>Baskinridge,</HI> I found Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> according to Appointment, had been preaching to the Congregation. It con&s;i&s;ted of about 3000 People. As I went along I told a Friend,
<Q>My Soul wept for them, and I was per&s;waded within my &s;elf, that the Lord would in that Day make his Power to be known among&s;t them.</Q>
In Prayer, I perceived my Soul drawn out, and a &s;tirring of Affection among the People. I had not di&s;cour&s;ed long, but the Holy Gho&s;t di&s;played his Power. In every Part of the Congregation, &s;ome Body or other began to cry out, and almo&s;t all melted into Tears. This abated for a few Moments, till a little Boy about &s;even or eight Years of Age cried out exceeding piteou&s;ly indeed, and wept as tho' his little Heart would break. Mr. <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> having Compa&s;&s;ion on him, took him up into the Wag|gon, which &s;o affected me that I broke from my Di&s;|cour&s;e, and told the People,
<Q>the little Boy &s;hould preach to them, and that God, &s;ince old Profe&s;&s;ors would not cry after Chri&s;t, had di&s;played his Sovereign|ty, and out of an Infant's Mouth was perfecting Prai&s;e.</Q>
God &s;o ble&s;&s;ed <HI>this,</HI> that an univer&s;al Concern fell on the Congregation again. Fre&s;h Per&s;ons dropp'd down here and there, and the Cry encrea&s;ed more and more. At length I concluded, and as I was going away, I asked the little Boy "what he cried for?" He an&s;wered, "his Sins" I then asked, "What he wanted?" He an&s;wer'd, "Chri&s;t" As I pa&s;&s;ed along, fre&s;h In&s;tances of God's Power pre&s;ented them&s;elves to my View. Many mourning after Je&s;us that would not be comforted. After Sermon, Mr. <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> gave Notice of an Evening Lecture in his Barn about two Miles off Thither we went, and a great Multitude followed. Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennent</HI> preach|ed fir&s;t, and that excellently well upon the Nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="10" REF="004853_0009_100E0270399E7D00">
and Benefit of &s;piritual De&s;ertions. I then began to pray, and felt the Spirit of God working in me mightily. A great Commotion was &s;oon ob&s;erved among the Hearers, I then gave a Word of Exhortation. The Lord's Pre|&s;ence attended it in a &s;urprizing Manner. One in about &s;ix Minutes cried out,
"He is come, he is come,"
and could &s;carce &s;u&s;tain the Di&s;covery that Je&s;us Chri&s;t made of him|&s;elf to his Soul. Others were &s;o earne&s;t for a Di&s;covery of the Lord to their Souls, that their eager Crying obli|ged me to &s;top, and I prayed over them as I &s;aw their Agonies and Di&s;tre&s;s increase. At length we &s;ung a Hymn, and then retired to the Hou&s;e where the Man that recei|ved Chri&s;t continued till near Midnight, talking of and prai&s;ing,
<HI>"his</HI> &s;weet <HI>Chri&s;t, his</HI> free hearted <HI>Christ,"</HI>
&amp;c. A gracious Woman, who had been wre&s;tling with God for a Di&s;play of his Power, was &s;o overcome with a Sen&s;e of his Goodne&s;s, that &s;he almo&s;t &s;woon'd away. And at length, my own Soul was &s;o full that I retired, and was in a &s;trong Agony for &s;ome Time, and wept before the Lord, under a deep Sen&s;e of my own Vilene&s;s, and the Sovereign|ty and Greatne&s;s of God's everla&s;ting Love. Mo&s;t of the People &s;pent the Remainder of the Night in Prayer and Prai&s;es. Two or three young Mini&s;ters &s;poke alter|nately, and others prayed as the Lord gave them Utte|rance Oh! it was a Night much to be remember'd! <HI>May the Lord make us mindful of it even to the Day of our Death.

"whether &s;he knew Chri&s;t?"
She &s;aid
"Yes" "How long?" "Three Years, &s;aid &s;he, the third <HI>Sunday</HI> in next <HI>March.</HI>"
I asked another the &s;ame Que&s;tion. She an&s;wered
<Q>Yes, but I am waiting for a fre&s;h Breath|ing from the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit.</Q>
I, with Plea&s;ure, took my Leave of them, and rode agreeably in Company with many Children of God, to <HI>New-Brun&s;wick,</HI> 23 Miles from <HI>Baskinridge.</HI> Here Letters awaited me from <HI>Savannah,</HI> acquainting me that there had been a great Mortality a|mong&s;t the People of that Place.

<P><HI>Saturday, November</HI> 8. Preached this Morning in the Meeting Hou&s;e, not to a very large or much affected Au|ditory &mdash; Was re&s;trained in public Preaching, but felt an e&s;pecial Pre&s;ence of God in my private Bu&s;ine&s;s. Set out immediately after Dinner, and was mercifully and very providentially pre&s;erved in going over two Creeks, which lay in the Way, and were much &s;well'd by the Rain. In one of them two of my Fellow-Travellers, in all Proba|bility, mu&s;t have peri&s;hed, had not a Woman cried out, and bid us &s;top. A Man touched, as I afterwards found, by my Mini&s;try, hearing my Voice, came and &s;wam our Hor&s;es over the other Creek, and conducted us &s;afe over a very narrow Bridge. About 8 we reached <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> tho' the Night was very dark indeed. Some Friends were ju&s;t come in, who had been out another Way to meet me. Se|veral with great Joy came to &s;alute me. We &s;ang, we prayed. The Lord inclined his Ear. My Soul was fil|led, as it were with Marrow and Fatne&s;s. I retired to Re&s;t, praying the Lord, that my coming to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> might be in the Fulne&s;s of the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Go&s;pel of Peace. <HI>Amen, &s;o be it</HI>!</P>

<P><HI>Sunday, November</HI> 9. Had &s;everal gracious Souls come to &s;ee me.&mdash; We prayed together. &mdash; The Lord much enlarged my Heart.

It was never preach'd in before. The Roof is not yet up, but the People rai&s;ed a convenient Pulpit, and boarded the Bottom. The Joy of mo&s;t of the Hearers, when they &s;aw me, was inexpre&s;&s;ible: Some &s;till mocked.

But, Oh how did they melt under bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h! My Soul was much rejoiced to look round on them, becau&s;e there were &s;ome who were now fairly brought through the Pangs of the New-Birth, who had been mo&s;t marvellous Offenders again&s;t the great God. I &s;hall mention two only. The fir&s;t is one
<Q>Mr. <HI>Brockden,</HI> Recorder of Deeds, &amp;c. a Man eminent in his Profe&s;&s;ion, but for many Years a notori|ous Deift. In his younger Day, he told me, he had &s;ome religious Impre&s;&s;ions, but coming into Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Cares of the World &s;o choaked the good Seed, that he not only forgat his God in &s;ome Degree, but at length began to doubt of, and to di&s;pute his very Being. In this State he continued many Years, and has been very zealous to propagate his Dei&s;tical, I could almo&s;t &s;ay Athei&s;tical Principles among moral Men, but he told me he never endeavoured to make Pro&s;elytes of vivious, debauched People. When I came to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> this Time Twelve month, he told me, he had not &s;o much as a Curio&s;ity to hear me But a Brother Deift, his choice&s;t Friend, pre&s;&s;ing him to come and hear me, to &s;atisfy his Curio&s;ity, he at length complyed with his Reque&s;t. It was Night. I preach'd at the Court Hou&s;e Stairs, upon the Conference which our Lord had with <HI>Nicodemus.</HI> &mdash; I had not &s;poke much before God &s;truck his Heart. For, &s;aid he, I &s;aw your Doctrine tended to make People good. His Family knew nothing that he had been to hear me. After he came Home his

Wi&s;e, who had been at Sermon, came in al&s;o, and wi&s;hed heartily that he had heard me. He &s;aid nothing. After this, another of his Family came in repeating the &s;ame Wi&s;h; and, if I mi&s;take not, after that another, till at la&s;t being unable to refrain any longer, with Tears in his Eyes, Why, &s;ays he, I have been hearing him; and then expre&s;&s;ed his Approbation. Ever &s;ince he has followed on to know the Lord, and I verily be|lieve Je&s;us Chri&s;t has made him&s;elf manife&s;t to his Soul. Tho' upwards of three&s;core Years old, he is now I believe born again of God. He is a little Child, and often (as he told me) receives &s;uch Communications from God, when he retires into the Woods, that he thinks he could die a Martyr for the Truth.</Q>
The next is one
<Q>CAPTAIN H&mdash;L, formerly as great a Reprobate as ever I heard of: Almo&s;t a Scandal and Reproach to human Nature. He u&s;ed to &s;wear to ea&s;e his Stomach, and was &s;o fond of new Oaths that he u&s;ed to go on Board the Tran&s;port Ships, and offer a Guinea for a new Oath, that he might have the Ho|nour of coining it. It would be endle&s;s to give In|&s;tances of his vile Profanene&s;s. To the Honour of God's Grace let it be &s;aid, he is now, I believe a Chri&s;tian. Not only reformed, but renewed. The ef|fectual Stroke, he told me, was given, when I preached la&s;t Spring at <HI>Pennypack,</HI> tho' under good Impre&s;&s;ions before. Ever &s;ince he has been zealous for the Truth, &s;tood like a Lamb when he was beaten, and in Danger of being murdered &s;ome Time ago, by many of my Oppo&s;ers, and, in &s;hort, &s;hews forth his Faith by his Works.</Q>

<Q>Whatever Men's carnal Rea&s;oning may &s;ugge&s;t, yet if the Children of God fairly examine their own Experiences, if they do God Ju&s;tice, they mu&s;t acknowledge that they did not chu&s;e God, but God cho&s;e them. And if he cho&s;e them at all, it mu&s;t be from Eternity, and that too without any Regard to any Thing fore&s;een in them.

<P><HI>Monday, November</HI> 10. Preached Morning and After|noon to very large Congregations, and ob&s;erved a won|derful &s;weet Power attend both, but e&s;pecially the Even|ing-Sermon.

All the vacant Time before and after preaching, I was employed in an&s;wering my <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Letters. <HI>Lord ble&s;s what was written to the Con|&s;olation and Edification of my dear Friends for Je&s;us Chri&s;t's Sake.</HI> Amen <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Nov.</HI> 15 Preached twice every Day this Week in the new Hou&s;e, one Morning excepted, when I preached in Mr. <HI>C&mdash;</HI>'s Meeting Hou&s;e on Account of the Snow. A mo&s;t &s;weet and wonderful Power went at that Time through the Congregation.

The lea&s;t Moving, I think, was one Afternoon, when I was unaccountably car|ried out to talk again&s;t Rea&s;oning Unbelievers. When I was at Dinner I had not fixed upon a Text. When I was going to preach, I was &s;o ill that &s;ome of my Friends ad|vi&s;ed me to go home. I thought it be&s;t to tru&s;t to God. I went on, began Preaching, and found my Heart &s;ome|what refre&s;hed, but all on a &s;udden, my Soul was &s;o carried out to talk again&s;t depending on our natural Rea|&s;on, that my Friends were a&s;toni&s;hed, and &s;o was I too: For I felt the Holy Gho&s;t come upon me at that Time, and never &s;pake on that wi&s;e before. As I was going home, I &s;aid to a Friend,
<Q>Surely &s;ome Rea&s;oners were in the Congregation.</Q>
Upon Enquiry, I found a Clu&s;ter of them were pre&s;ent, and then knew wherefore I was &s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted. <HI>Oh who would but tru&s;t in God</HI>! One of the&s;e Rea&s;oners a little after, meeting Mr. <HI>B&mdash;n,</HI> &s;aid,

<P>Another Afternoon, there was &s;uch an univer&s;al Com|motion in the Congregation, as I never &s;aw in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> before. One or two cried out in a mo&s;t pitious Manner, and Numbers wept &s;o &s;orely, that I broke off Prayer after Sermon &s;ooner than otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have done.

the Lord. I preached on the&s;e Words, <HI>What &s;hall I do to be &s;aved?</HI> And as I afterwards found, was very providentially directed to that Subject. For one Mrs. <HI>P&mdash;r,</HI> as I have it in a Paper taken from her own Mouth, went to Mr. <HI>Cummings</HI> to know,
<Q>Why I &s;hould not preach in the Church?</Q>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Child,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UNder written are the dying Words of your <HI>Aunt,</HI> which I &s;end for your Satisfaction and Information. She died <HI>October</HI> 7th between the Hours of nine and ten in the Morning, being fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">led with the <HI>full A&s;&s;urance of</HI> Faith <HI>in Chri&s;t,</HI> and a joyful Hope of eternal Salvation through his <HI>Merits</HI> and Mediation.</P>
<P>As your Aunt and I were p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aying to our Lord Je&s;us to give her the Comforts of his Holy Spirit to &s;upport her under the Agonies of Death, &s;he replied, <HI>I &s;ee him! I &s;ee him! Now I &s;ee Light</HI> After this &s;he continued in Prayer about half an Hour, but her Speech failing her, we could not during that Time under&s;tand what &s;he &s;pake, only we could bear the Name of Je&s;us often and <HI>Come Je&s;us! Come Je&s;us.</HI> Then again &s;he &s;pake out plainly, and &s;aid <HI>Who would die without a God? Now I &s;ee Light. God has let me &s;ee my Error. I had not repented

of my original Sin. Oh the Fal&s;ene&s;s of our Hearts! O &s;earch your Hearts, before you come to this; for they are fal&s;e.</HI> Then &s;he lay in an Agony about half an Hour, and a|gain &s;pake out, and &s;aid, <HI>God has let me &s;ee great and glo|rious Things which would not be believed, if they were told.</HI> Then your Uncle <HI>R&mdash;s,</HI> coming into the Room &s;pake to your Aunt <HI>S&mdash;s,</HI> and your <HI>dying</HI> Aunt hearing his Voice, calleth him to her, and when he was come, &s;he &s;pake to us and &s;aid, <HI>Mind what I &s;ay to you; for hereafter you mu&s;t all give an Account of what I now &s;ay to you; for I &s;peak by the Spirit of God. He has enabled me to &s;peak to you before I go, (for I am ju&s;t a going)</HI> Then &s;he &s;aid, <HI>God is a ju&s;t God as well as merciful. Be diligent in &s;earch|ing your Hearts. Brother, tell Mr. &mdash; he is in the Wrong.</HI> Then &s;he &s;aid <HI>My Pain is great, but Chri&s;t is &s;uf|ficient for me.</HI> And &s;he repeated that <HI>God had let her &s;ee great Things that would not be believed, if they were told.</HI> She &s;aid al&s;o, <HI>Follow</HI> Whitefield, <HI>God will ble&s;s him wherever he goes.</HI> &mdash; Don't &s;peak lightly of him. Ble&s;s him, ble&s;s him. God has enabled me to &s;peak to you before I go. I am ju&s;t a going. Farewell, Farewell. God be with you! Then &s;he compo&s;ed her&s;elf, and lay about half an Hour, and neither mov'd nor groan'd, except her Lips and Tongue, and the heaving of her Brea&s;t in breathing, &s;eeming to be in her per|fect Sen&s;es till about a Minute before &s;he died &mdash; She look'd round at each of us that were about her Bed, and then departed in Quietne&s;s. Her Hands and Arms, up to her Elbows, were cold, and al&s;o her Face, when &s;he &s;pake what is here in&s;erted, and &s;ome Time before. As &s;he lay begging that the Lord would take her away, I felt her <HI>No&s;e</HI> and told her, <HI>it</HI> was cold; and &s;he re|plied, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be God for it,</HI> and again, <HI>My Soul thir&s;teth after thee,</HI> I come, Lord Je&s;us. I come.</P>
<P>Thus far Mr <HI>Bryan,</HI> I &s;hall only add, O Death, <HI>where is thy Sting</HI>! O Grave, <HI>where is thy Victory over true Be|lievers! What Fools are they that count their Lives Madne&s;s</HI></P>

<P><HI>Sunday, January</HI> 4. Came hither Ye&s;terday in Com|pany with both the Mr. <HI>B&mdash;</HI>'s, and &s;everal other dear Friends.

<P><HI>Saturday, Jan.</HI> 10. Preached twice every Day this Week, and expounded frequently in the Evening to a great Company at Mr. <HI>F&mdash;</HI>'s. The Lord Je&s;us a&s;&s;i&s;ted and enlightned me. The Holy Gho&s;t applied the Word with Power. Several had acquainted me what God had done for their Souls; and one was filled &s;o with Commu|nications from <HI>above,</HI> when a Di&s;covery of Chri&s;t was made to her Soul, that &s;he continued a whole Night pray|ing to and prai&s;ing God. Some have fallen away for the pre&s;ent, but ble&s;&s;ed be God, the greate&s;t Part continue &s;tedfa&s;t, and are rather more forward and affectionate than ever. Enemies are more enraged. As a Proof of it, take the following In&s;tance. &mdash; When Mr. <HI>Jonathan B&mdash;n</HI> came to <HI>Georgia,</HI> he &s;hewed me a Letter written by his Brother Mr. <HI>Hugh B&mdash;n,</HI> in which it was hinted that the Clergy break their Canons, and this he de&s;ired me to correct for the Pre&s;s. I did. <HI>It</HI> was publi&s;hed this Week.

<P><HI>Sunday, Jan.</HI> 18. Continued on board the&s;e two Days to &s;ettle our <HI>Ship</HI> Affairs, and di&s;patch &s;ome other Bu&s;i|ne&s;s. Was but weak in Body.

<P>Sailed over <HI>Charle&s;town</HI> Bar, <HI>Jan.</HI> 24. and arrived at <HI>Falmouth</HI> on the 11th of <HI>March.</HI> The Lord was plea&s;ed to give us a favourable Pa&s;&s;age. About three Days after we &s;et &s;ail, we had a violent Storm, which continued about four Hours. During the re&s;t of the Pa&s;&s;age, we had uncommonly plea&s;ant Weather and fair Winds, till we came very near upon Soundings. Afterwards, the ble&s;&s;ed God was plea&s;ed to detain us near a fortnight. But the Weather was plea&s;ant, and through the Bounty of our dear <HI>Charle&s;town</HI> Friends, we had all Things richly to enjoy. In the Beginning of the Voyage, my Body was
<PB N="38" REF="004853_0037_100E02ACD2167670">
weak, and my Soul &s;omewhat low. But afterwards, God was plea&s;ed to &s;trengthen me both in Body &amp; Soul. The&s;e Words came one Day with great Power upon my Heart, <HI>Ari&s;e, Go into Nineveh, the great City, and preach unto it the Preaching that I bid thee.</HI> At another Time, the Lord &s;poke to me by the&s;e Words, <HI>Take the Foxes, the little Foxes that &s;poil the Vines: For our Vine have tender Grapes.</HI> This Part of <HI>Jo&s;eph's</HI> Ble&s;&s;ing was one Night brought home to me with a &s;weet Power: <HI>The Archers have &s;orely grieved him, and &s;hot at him, and hated him. But his Bow abode in Strength, and the Arms of his Hands were made-&s;trong, by the Hands of the mighty God of Jacob.</HI> And, at another Time, when my Soul was dejected at a Sen&s;e of my own Weakne&s;&s;es, and the Number and Greatne&s;s of my im|pending Trials, the Lord rai&s;ed and comforted me with this Promi&s;e: <HI>Fear thou not, for I am with thee: Be not di&s;mayed, for I am thy God: I will &s;trengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the Right Hand of my Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The Books of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> and <HI>Exodus,</HI> which I expounded in Cour&s;e, Morning and Evening, were much ble&s;&s;ed to my &s;piritual Comfort. And the Lord has been plea&s;ed to give me Freedom to write down &s;ome of my extempore Di&s;cour&s;es, which I hope he will ble&s;s for his own Name's Sake. In &s;hort, this Voyage has been a pro|fitable Voyage to my Soul, becau&s;e of my having had many &s;weet Opportunities for Reading, Meditation and Prayer. I cannot but adore the Providence of God in &s;avouring me with &s;uch ble&s;&s;ed Retirements as I have frequently enjoyed on the great Waters. I dared not expect to meet with &s;uch Succe&s;s as he has been plea&s;ed to give me abroad: And I doubt not but I &s;hall yet &s;ee greater Things there as well as at home.
