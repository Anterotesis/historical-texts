<Q>THE GOD OF ISRAEL SAID, THE ROCK OF ISRAEL SPAKE TO ME, HE THAT RULETH OVER MEN MUST BE JUST, RULING IN THE FEAR OF GOD.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IMPORTANT are the rights of mankind, to the &s;afe and unmole&s;ted enjoyment of life, liberty and property, and to the be&s;t improve|ment of all their powers, with every rea&s;onable and equitable advantage they have to promote their pre&s;ent and everla&s;ting welfare. The&s;e na|tural rights, civil and religious, are the gifts of God, as &s;uch &s;acred; nor may any but He, as original proprietor, re&s;ume them at plea&s;ure. But in &s;uch a world as this, lying in wickedne&s;s, abounding with unruly pa&s;&s;ions, mi&s;taken views, cla&s;hing intere&s;ts and violence, there can be no
<PB N="6" REF="011691_0005_0F87EC329D23FDD0">
rational foundation for the &s;ecurity of them, without civil government.</P>
<P>THIS evinces the urgent nece&s;&s;ity and high utility of civil in&s;titution; and proclaims it the dictate of rea&s;on, of nature, and the will of God. Divine revelation, in expre&s;s and peremptory lan|guage, confirms it, "the ordinance of God."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 13. 2.</NOTE> This likewi&s;e points out to view, the good of the community, to be the high end of govern|ment, and the &s;upreme law of the &s;tate. The important rights, liberties, privileges and immu|nities of the community, (&s;o far as is requi&s;ite to the end of government) being by &s;pecial tru&s;t put into the hand of rulers, by God and the people, for their pre&s;ervation, be&s;t enjoyment and improvement. A tru&s;t, of very high and endearing importance, by which they are con&s;tituted the immediate guardians of them.</P>
<P>THESE, as the &s;alutary objects, and &s;ublime end of government, are tacitly pointed out in the text. "He that ruleth over men," not brutes, who may be made &s;laves, or killed for the conveni|ency of others; but men, of the &s;ame rank of being, dignity of nature, and ve&s;ted with the &s;ame great and e&s;&s;ential rights with them&s;elves, "mu&s;t be ju&s;t" in his attentive regard to them, "ruling in the fear of God."</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="011691_0006_0F87EC335D249240">
UPON the&s;e principles, it is evident, that the dignity of government, and the great e&s;&s;ential rights and privileges of &s;ubjects, mu&s;t, of right, be inviolably maintained. "He that ruleth over men," mu&s;t be known, duly honored and obeyed, in his exalted &s;tation. If the dignity of govern|ment, be degraded and weakened, the &s;trength and energy of government, will be proportionably enervated, that it cannot reach, and effectuate, the great de&s;ign of it. On the other hand, if the great and e&s;&s;ential rights and privileges of the people, be invaded and &s;upplanted, u&s;urped and de&s;troyed: the de&s;ign of government is &s;ubverted, and the end of it fru&s;trated, in the primary and fundamental intention of it. No exalted ideas of power and prerogative, can be ju&s;t, as applying it to &s;uch de&s;tructive purpo&s;es. All the high prerogatives of power, are for the good of the &s;ubjects, their wanton exertion therefore, for the de&s;truction of their unforfeited lives, liberties and properties, mu&s;t be the perver&s;ion of them, a con|travention and &s;ubver&s;ion of their true intention.</P>
<P>THESE two important objects, which demand every one's attention, may with great rea&s;on be &s;uppo&s;ed to be invariably united, in the con&s;titu|tion and nature of things&mdash;and yet, there may &s;ometimes happen no &s;mall difficulty, to adju&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="011691_0007_0F87EC341D24F7D0">
and compromi&s;e both: but perhaps, this will &s;eldom or never occur; except, where there has been a deviation, from true wi&s;dom, good policy and righteou&s;ne&s;s: in &s;uch ca&s;e, the remedy may &s;eem equally plain and ea&s;y, in a &s;peedy rever&s;ion of the mea&s;ures, which have occa&s;ioned &s;uch perplexity in admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>THERE is a method, in the con&s;titution and nature of things, forever to maintain (&s;o far as is within the power of the &s;tate to do it) the dig|nity of government, with the rights and privi|leges of &s;ubjects, in the greate&s;t harmony. This will be found, in a good con&s;titution of civil polity&mdash;in a good admini&s;tration of civil govern|ment, pur&s;uant to the &s;pirit and intention of &s;uch a con&s;titution&mdash;and in the joint concurrence and co-opperation of &s;ubjects with their rulers, to the &s;ame noble and important de&s;ign.</P>
<P>A GOOD con&s;titution of civil polity, by which, rulers of every rank and order from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, hold all their powers and prero|gatives, emoluments and honors; and the &s;ubjects, all their rights and liberties, privileges and im|munities; is of very intere&s;ting importance to every free &s;tate; without which, all the rights and privileges of &s;ubjects, re&s;t upon a very weak
<PB N="9" REF="011691_0008_0F87EC34DD2063F0">
foundation, and are held by a very &s;lippery and uncertain tenure, the will and caprice of rulers in power. What a mi&s;erable foundation of &s;ecurity this! is fatally &s;een and felt, in de&s;potic and ar|bitrary governments through the world. Whereas, in a well framed con&s;titution, which contains ample provi&s;ion, to maintain the dignity of go|vernment, with the privileges of the people&mdash;where power and privilege are &s;o e&s;&s;entially incor|porated&mdash;that the one cannot of right, be held and exerci&s;ed, without the protection of the other&mdash;nor the other enjoyed, without the &s;upport of the powers of government; there is the be&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t &s;ecurities, both to rulers and &s;ubjects, that can be, in the imperfect and mutable &s;tate of things, in this world. Such is the &s;trong, the beautiful and happy complection of the Briti&s;h, of our own con&s;titution.</P>
<P>A GOOD admini&s;tration pur&s;uant to the &s;pirit and intention of a free and good con&s;titution, is of like importance with the con&s;titution it&s;elf. The be&s;t con&s;titution cannot operate, as an efficient effectual machine to the ends of government, un|le&s;s life and energy be given to it, in admini&s;tration. The Jews were endow'd by the &s;ingular favour and gift of God, with an excellent con&s;titution: adapted with infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s to their &s;tate,
<PB N="10" REF="011691_0009_0F87EC359D22CD20">
and to the be&s;t ends of government and religion to them; (it were ea&s;y to &s;hew the eminent advantages of it, were there time and were it not foreign to the occa&s;ion) but the Rock of I&s;rael &s;aid&mdash;there mu&s;t be ju&s;t rulers in admini&s;tration, <Q>ruling in the fear of God.</Q> And if rulers and &s;ubjects had fully an&s;wered the great de&s;ign of their con&s;ti|tution; God would have exalted them in name and prai&s;e, felicity and honour; high above all the nations of the earth.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Deut. 26. 18, 19.</NOTE> Their hi&s;tory fully evinces, it went well or ill with them, according to good or bad admini&s;tration, and their conduct under it. The great con&s;equences which follow a good or bad admini&s;tration, do mo&s;t fully evi|dence the importance of a good one. The &s;ha|dow may remain, and the &s;ub&s;tance be de&s;troyed, the form be retained and the &s;pirit of the con|&s;titution evani&s;h, and the great intention of it be defeated; yea the powers erected by the be&s;t con|&s;titution may be turn'd again&s;t it, to invade, &s;ubvert and de&s;troy it, in the fundamental intention and municipal privileges of it: Subjects may feel them|&s;elves very &s;en&s;ibly injur'd, perplex'd, di&s;tre&s;s'd and wretched; and the cry of grievance and oppre&s;|&s;ion, complaints and groans may be heard from every quarter, under the tragedy of a bad admi|ni&s;tration. Whil&s;t on the other hand, the ends of government may be tollerably an&s;wer'd, the

people enjoy much peace and quiet, under the mo&s;t defective con&s;titutions and ill-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">m'd governments in the world; under a wi&s;e, righteous, lenient and good admini&s;tration: which however rarely hap|pens in them; but how much more under the meridian &s;hines of a good admini&s;tration, pur&s;uant to the &s;pirit and intention of a free and excel|lent con&s;titution; where they enjoy it with its be&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;irable advantages: <HI>and whereby</HI> the dignity of government, and privileges of the people will be exalted in &s;afety.</P>
<P>THIS &s;hews the vigilant attention, every free people &s;hould give, to the &s;pirit, tenor and tendency of admini&s;tration: Their peace and welfare, their con&s;titution it&s;elf, with all its important privileges and &s;ecurities, to them&s;elves and po&s;terity to the late&s;t generations, is nearly concern'd in it.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, this view of admini&s;tration may al&s;o &s;ugge&s;t to us, why the all-wi&s;e and gracious God has in&s;tituted and enjoin'd no particular form of government, for all the nations, kingdoms, empires and governments of this world; but left each to choo&s;e and determine for them&s;elves, as is judg'd mo&s;t &s;uitable, convenient or nece&s;&s;ary to them. <Q>The God of I&s;rael hath &s;aid</Q> in the revelation given us, that civil government is "the ordinance of God"&mdash;has &s;et to view the end of it, rulers are the mini|&s;ters of God for good&mdash;has a&s;certain'd the general
<PB N="12" REF="011691_0011_0F87EC371D1C2218">
duties of rulers and &s;ubjects, and bound them thereto, by the &s;tronge&s;t ties of intere&s;t and con&s;cience, in the motives of this world and eternity&mdash;the&s;e well at|tended to by both, and the ends of government are well an&s;wered.</P>
<P>IT is of weighty concern, that there be the joint concurrence and co-operation of &s;ubjects with their rulers to the &s;ame excellent and important de&s;ign.</P>
<P>THE duty and intere&s;ts of &s;ubjects, in&s;eparably con|joyn'd, mo&s;t &s;trongly oblige to it: and ordinarily, under a free government and good admini&s;tration, they will fully effect it. Indeed, the infatuated with &s;lavi&s;h principles of religion and policy, may, under a foreign influence, be in&s;tigated to in&s;urrections and rebellions under a good admini&s;tration; (as happen'd in the good reigns of our illu&s;trious Kings GEORGE I. and II. of precious memory) but it is not the true &s;pirit of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, Europeans or Americans, (however &s;landered) to act &s;uch a treacherous and dete&s;table part: but the body of the people, well u&s;ed, will readily unite their power and influence, in &s;upport of the con&s;titution and powers of a good admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>IT is allow'd, that parties and factions may be form'd by the unea&s;y, re&s;tle&s;s and ambitious, under the be&s;t admini&s;trations, may injure and di&s;turb go|vernment, and ob&s;truct the &s;alutary good effects of

it for a &s;ea&s;on&mdash;but can &s;eldom ri&s;e high, &s;pread far, or long continue without real and very &s;en&s;ible in|juries and grievances: And are u&s;ually reduced or remedied without great difficulty or hazard.</P>
<P>BUT too often, the mo&s;t loyal, be&s;t and vertuous &s;ubjects are mi&s;repre&s;ented, and blacken'd with the wrong imputation of tho&s;e heinous crimes of di&s;loy|alty, di&s;affection, rebellion, &amp;c. which they abhor with all their hearts: As it was with Daniel and his brethren, when they refus'd obedience to the mo&s;t &s;tupid edict of idolatry. And this is commonly the ca&s;e, where a brave, loyal, and vertuous people, are to be &s;trip'd of their invaluable privileges, and reduc'd to abject &s;lavery, by the arm of power. But no arts, fal&s;hoods, or di&s;gui&s;eful colourings, can alter the nature, or long conceal this plain truth&mdash;that an unoppre&s;&s;ed, free and vertuous people, will &s;ee it their intere&s;t and important duty; and will readily concur and co-opperate with their rulers in &s;upporting the dignity of government, with their own rights and privileges&mdash;the la&s;t, and fini&s;hing &s;troke by the hand of man; to the harmonious accompli&s;hment, of this great and excellent de&s;ign.</P>
<P>WE rejoice, we boa&s;t in the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and in our royal charter, the be&s;t privileges and im|munities, the happie&s;t con&s;titution and form of government in the whole world: the next matter of highe&s;t moment to us, to our enjoyment of the

be&s;t ble&s;&s;ings we can hope from civil polity, is a good admini&s;tration pur&s;uant to the &s;pirit and grand intention of it.</P>
<P>To inve&s;tigate the &s;pirit and be&s;t principles of &s;uch an admini&s;tration, is of importance in it &s;elf, &s;uitable to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and what I &s;hall briefly at|tempt.</P>
<P>IT is conci&s;ely and comprehen&s;ively &s;ugge&s;ted, in this in&s;pired me&s;&s;age from God, to the exalted King of I&s;rael, and to all the rulers of this world, where his revelation comes. <Q>He that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God.</Q></P>
<P>THE phra&s;ealogy of the &s;acred cannon, will war|rant us to under&s;tand by ju&s;tice, <HI>integrity;</HI> and by the fear of God, <HI>piety.</HI> Nor will it be doubted, but this royal in&s;truction and mandate, from the &s;upreme and eternal King, is to all the powers of government, &s;upreme or &s;ubordinate, legi&s;lative or executive, to every department and tru&s;t in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>WHENCE we collect this ob&s;ervation;</P>
<P>INTEGRITY and piety, joyn'd with &s;uitable tal|ents, are the be&s;t principles, and give the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urance of a good admini&s;tration of government:</P>
<P>Or,</P>

AN admini&s;tration, form'd and conducted, by in|tegrity and the fear of God; will be&s;t &s;upport the dignity of government, &s;ecure the liberty of &s;ubjects, and advance the public welfare.</P>
<P>THIS might be illu&s;trated by &s;hewing&mdash;the&s;e di|vine principles are the highe&s;t and mo&s;t energetic principles of good action in general, and proporti|onably in rulers in their high &s;pheres of action&mdash;they are the be&s;t &s;afe-guards again&s;t all the high temptations of power, from fear, intere&s;t or ambition&mdash;they dictate the mo&s;t excellent de&s;igns, and urge to the be&s;t pro&s;ecution of them&mdash;they derive great energy and &s;upport, from the mo&s;t weighty motives of religion and eternity&mdash;they en&s;ure the be&s;t and mo&s;t excellent rewards to enforce duty&mdash;the be&s;t e&s;teem of mankind, at lea&s;t of the wi&s;er and better part&mdash;the approbation of God and con&s;cience, infi|nitely to be preferred to the plaudit of the whole world&mdash;and in connection herewith, the great and bli&s;sful rewards of eternity.

<P>FIRST, Wi&s;dom and prudence will conduct the admini&s;tration, form'd upon the principles of inte|grity and piety. The wi&s;dom of its councils, is the high honour as well as &s;afety, of every &s;tate. Supe|rior talents are very important, in exalted &s;tations of power; but it is wi&s;dom and integrity, gives them a right direction; and turns them to the greate&s;t advantage: &s;ever'd from the&s;e vertues, they will be in a great degree u&s;ele&s;s, and may be turn'd to per|nicious purpo&s;es. The&s;e illu&s;trious vertues, are of high utility and continual importance, in the widely extended concerns and intere&s;ts of the &s;tate; to guide the exterior connections and internal regulations of it, by the wi&s;e&s;t mea&s;ures, to the mo&s;t &s;alutary pur|po&s;es: and eminently &s;o, in &s;ea&s;ons of peculiar em|bara&s;&s;ment, perplexity and dangers.

Perhaps as many &s;tates have been ruined by the infatuated folly of fal&s;e policy, as determined perver&s;ene&s;s.

engage his attention, in a &s;uperior &s;phere of action and influence. Are they mini&s;ters of God? In rea&s;on and gratitude they ought to acknowledge and honor him, as the fountain of their abilities and authority, honor and influence. They mu&s;t be ju&s;t in their care of the rights and intere&s;ts of &s;ubjects; they mu&s;t rule in the fear of God and for God, with a &s;upreme regard to his will and law, authority, honor and approbation. The intere&s;ts of true religion and vertue, as well as ju&s;tice, mu&s;t be patronized and encouraged accor|ding to its benignant influence to the good of the &s;tate and happine&s;s of rulers and &s;ubjects, an&s;wer|able to the character of nur&s;ing fathers to the church of God. It is by no means my de&s;ign, to labor this point, and pur&s;ue the argument at large&mdash;But allowing king David to under&s;tand the in&s;truction of God to him in the text, and his example in admini&s;tration to be a ju&s;t comment upon it, (which is but a rea&s;onable allowance, con|&s;idering he was a man after God's own heart, and al&s;o an in&s;pired prophet) and the point &s;eems clear. So he under&s;tood and practi&s;ed upon it, removing the wicked far from him, and putting the faithful of the land in office; who would have a care of religion and vertue, as well as ju&s;tice. He was an illu&s;trious patron and encourager of the wor&s;hip of God, of true religion and vertue, by word, example and influence.

He may not be imitated by unin&s;pired men, in things which he did as an in&s;pired prophet: but in his ge|neral conduct as an eminent friend, patron and in|courager of piety and vertue; he is &s;et up by God, as an example for his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in admini&s;tration. 1 Kings 11. 28. ch. 14. 8. and other places.</P>
<P>MUCH may be done by rulers, in making &s;alu|tary provi&s;ion for the protection and &s;upport of public wor&s;hip, religion and vertue, and by counte|nance, example and influence, without interfering with the &s;acred rights of con&s;cience, or the prero|gatives of the Lord of con&s;cience, in adding to, or dimini&s;hing from what is already e&s;tabli&s;hed by his &s;upreme authority. And it is evidently import|ant, becau&s;e religion and vertue are the great &s;up|ports of the &s;tate. This is &s;o plain a dictate of rea&s;on and ob&s;ervation, that it has had the general concur|rent te&s;timony of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t in all ages. Impiety, immorality and vice are a wound to the vitals of the &s;tate; nor can any long flouri&s;h, or if free, retain their liberty, if the&s;e enemies are pre|valent in the bowels of it. The favour of God, (from who&s;e grace and providence comes all good) will accompany true religion and vertue: but his wrath will be pour'd out on profligate &s;tates and kingdoms.

<P>FIFTHLY, The public welfare will fix the at|tention, in&s;pire and invigorate the be&s;t efforts for the advancement of it; in rulers of integrity and piety. Actuated by the exalted principles of love to God, to their country and to mankind; they will be born on, with an inextingui&s;hable ardor in the pur&s;uit of the public welfare.

Rulers of this excellent &s;pirit, will feel them&s;elves mo&s;t &s;trongly united in intere&s;t and af|fection

This is a &s;ource of the be&s;t paternal or patriotic affection and labors; which cannot fail of the benignant effects of true patrioti&s;m, controuling and &s;ubordinating all irre|gular &s;elfi&s;h views and intere&s;ts to the good of the public. This excellent &s;pirit, with its benign influence and effects, &s;hone with great lu&s;tre in the admini&s;trations of Mo&s;es, Mordecai, Daniel and others in &s;acred hi&s;tory. The public good, in all its im|portant branches, the liberty, wealth, power and honor of the community, whatever tends to make it ea&s;y, pro&s;perous and re&s;pectable, will engage the attention, and invigorate the labors, of rulers of in|tegrity and piety. Vigilant care will be taken, that the be&s;t ends be propo&s;ed, the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t mea&s;ures be concerted, and carried into execution, for the public welfare.</P>
<P>LASTLY, A dignity of &s;pirit, an intrepid cour|age and magnanimity will &s;upport an admini&s;tration form'd upon the principles of integrity and piety.</P>

A PERTINACIOUS ob&s;tinacy in the pur&s;uit of wrong mea&s;ures, evidently injurious to the com|monwealth; and an ea&s;y flexibility and in&s;tability that turns with every wind, are alike very per|nicious to government.

Whereas, 'tis the dignity, &s;trength and glory of an admini&s;tration, where the be&s;t ends are pur&s;ued&mdash;the be&s;t cau&s;es &s;upported&mdash;the be&s;t mea&s;ures adopted and carried into execution with un&s;haken firmne&s;s, intrepid courage, and unfailing magnanimity.

The frowns or flatteries of the world, the cavils or re|proaches of the di&s;contented and factious cannot &s;hake &s;uch a firm foundation.
