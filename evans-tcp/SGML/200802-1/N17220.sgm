Life, La&s;t Words and Dying <HI>CONFESSION,</HI> OF RACHEL WALL, Who, with <HI>William Smith</HI> and <HI>William Dunogan,</HI> were executed at BOSTON, on Thur&s;day, <DATE>October 8, 1789</DATE>, for HIGH-WAY ROBBERY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>BOSTON-GOAL,</HI>
<DATE>WEDNESDAY EVENING, <HI>October</HI> 7, 1789.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I RACHEL WALL, was born in the town of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> in the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, in the year 1760, of hone&s;t and reputable parents, who were alive and in good health not long &s;ince: They gave me a good edu|cation, and in&s;tructed me in the funda|mental principles of the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion, and taught me the fear of God; and if I had followed the good advice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;hould never have come to this untimely fate. When I left home I had three brothers and two &s;i&s;ters alive and well.</P>
<P>Without doubt the ever-curious Pub|lic, (but more e&s;pecially tho&s;e of a &s;eri|ous turn of mind) will be anxious to know every particular circum&s;tance of the Life and Character of a per&s;on in my unhappy &s;ituation, but in a peculiar manner tho&s;e relative to my birth and parentage</P>
<P>With regard to my Parents, I have only room in this &s;hort Narrative to ob|&s;erve, that my father was a Farmer, who was in good circum&s;tances when I left him. Both my parents being of the Pre&s;byterian, or rather Congregational Per&s;ua&s;ion, I was educated in the &s;ame way. My father was of a very &s;erious and devout turn of mind, and always made it his con&s;tant practice to perform family-prayers in his hou&s;e every morn|ing and evening; and was very careful to call his children and family together every Sabbath-day evening, to hear the holy &s;criptures, and other pious books read to them; each one being obliged, after reading was over, to give an an&s;wer to &s;uch que&s;tions in the A&s;&s;embly's Cate|chi&s;m as were propo&s;ed to them.</P>
<P>I left my parents without their con&s;ent when I was very young, and returning again was received by them, but could not be contented; therefore I tarried with them but two years, before I left them again, and have never &s;een them &s;ince.</P>
<P>I came away with one <HI>George Wall,</HI> to whom I was lawfully married: If I had never &s;een him I &s;hould not have left my parents. I went with him to <HI>Philadel|phia</HI>; we tarried there &s;ome time, but left that place and went to <HI>New-York,</HI> where we &s;taid about three months.&mdash; From thence we came to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> where he tarried with me &s;ome time, and then went off, leaving me an entire &s;tranger: Upon which I went to &s;ervice and lived very contented, and &s;hould have remain|ed &s;o, had it not been for my hu&s;band; for, as &s;oon as he came back, he enticed me to leave my &s;ervice and take to bad company, from which I may date my ruin. I hope my unhappy fate will be a &s;olemn warning to him. He went off again and left me, and where he is now I know not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> forgive him, as I expect forgivene&s;s at the bar of God, through the merits of my dear Saviour and Redeemer JESUS CHRIST, who is able to &s;ave all tho&s;e that, by faith, come unto him, not re|fu&s;ing even the chief of &s;inners.</P>
<P>I hope my awful and untimely fate will be a &s;olemn warning and caution to every one, but more particularly to the youth, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of my own &s;ex.</P>
<P>I acknowledge my&s;elf to have been guilty of a great many crimes, &s;uch as Sabbath-breaking, &s;tealing, lying, di&s;o|bedience to parents, and almo&s;t every other &s;in a per&s;on could commit, except murder; and have not lived in the fear of God, nor regarded the kind admoni|tions and coun&s;els of man.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the many &s;mall crimes I have committed, are too numerous to mention in this &s;heet, and therefore a particular narrative of them here would &s;erve to extend a work of this kind to too great a length; which crimes I mo&s;t &s;incerely de&s;ire to confe&s;s to Almighty God, humbly hoping forgivene&s;s thro' his dear Son.</P>
<P>But as I could heartily wi&s;h that the innocent may not &s;uffer with the guilty, I &s;hall, in &s;ome degree, deviate from my fir&s;t intention, by relating the particu|lars of &s;ome material tran&s;actions of my life, which, perhaps, may &s;erve as a &s;o|lemn warning to the living, of my &s;ex at lea&s;t; e&s;pecially to tho&s;e whom they may more immediately concern: They are as follow, viz.</P>
<P>In one of my nocturnal excur&s;ions, when the bright godde&s;s Venus &s;hined con&s;picuous, and was the predominant Planet among the heavenly bodies, &s;ome|time in the &s;pring of 1787, not being able to a&s;certain the exact time, I happened to go on board a &s;hip, lying at the Long-Wharf, in Bo&s;ton;&mdash;the Captain's name I cannot recollect, but think he was a Frenchman: On my entering the cabin, the door of which not being fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tened, and finding the Captain and Mate a&s;leep in their beds, I hunted about for plunder, and di&s;covered, under the Cap|tain's head, a black &s;ilk handkerchief containing upwards of thirty pounds, in gold, crowns, and &s;mall change, on which I immediately &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zed the booty and decamped therewith as quick as po&s;&s;ible; which money I &s;pent freely in comapny as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and wicked as my&s;elf, fully proving the old adage, "Light come light go."</P>
<P>At another time, I think it was about the year 1788, I br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke into a &s;loop, on board of which I was acquainted, lying at Doane's Wharf, in this town, and finding the Captain and every hand on board a|&s;leep in the cabin and &s;teerage, I looked round to &s;ee what I could help my&s;elf to, when I e&s;pied a &s;ilver watch hanging over the Captain's head, which I pocketed. I al&s;o took a pair of &s;ilver buckles out of the Captain's &s;hoes: I likewi&s;e made free with a parcel of &s;mall change for pocket-money, to make my&s;elf merry among my <HI>evil companions</HI>&punc; and made my e&s;cape without being di&s;covered.</P>
<P>I would beg the patience of the public for only a few minutes, while I relate a|nother adventure that happened in the cour&s;e of my life, which, were it not for the novelty thereof, might be thought too trifling to mention in this &s;heet; but with a view of gratifying the curio&s;ity of &s;ome particular friends, who have been very kind to me under &s;entence. I have con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ed to give it to the publi&s;her for in&s;er|tion, which is as follows:</P>
<P>Sometime about the year 1785, my hu&s;band being confined in the Goal in this place for the&s;e, I had a mind to try an expedient to extricate him from his impri&s;onment, which was to have a brick-loaf baked, in which I contrived to enclo&s;e a number of tools, &s;uch as a &s;aw, file, &amp;c. in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t him to make his e&s;cape, which was handed to him by the goaler in per&s;on, who little &s;u&s;pected &s;uch a trick was playing with him; however, it like to have had the de&s;ired effect the crafty contriver intended; for, by means of this &s;tratagem, the poor culprit, <HI>Wall,</HI> had bu|&s;ily employed him&s;elf with the implements that his kind help-mate had in this curi|ous manner conveyed to him, and had nearly effected his de&s;ign before it was di&s;|covered.</P>
<P>I do now, in the pre&s;ence of God, de|clare Mi&s;s Dorothy Horn, a crippled per|&s;on in Bo&s;ton Alms-Hou&s;e, to be entirely innocent of the theft at Mr. Vaughn's in E&s;&s;ex-Street, tho' &s;he &s;uffered a long im|pri&s;onment, was &s;et on the gallows one hour, and whipped five &s;tripes therefor.</P>
<P>As to the crime of Robbery, for which I am in a few hours to &s;uffer an ignomini|ous death. I am entirely innocent to the truth of this declaration I appeal to that God before whom I mu&s;t &s;hortly appear, to give an account of every tran&s;action of my life.</P>
<P>With regard to the above Robbery, I would beg permi&s;&s;ion to relate a few par|ticulars, which are, that I had been at work all the preceding day, and was on my way home in the evening, without de|&s;ign to injure any per&s;on: in my way I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the &s;treet; what it was I knew not, until I was taken up; I never &s;aw Mi&s;s <HI>Bendar</HI> (the per&s;on I was charg|ed with robbing that evening) and was quite &s;urpri&s;ed when the crime was laid to my charge. The witne&s;&s;es who &s;wore a|gain&s;t me are certainly mi&s;taken; but as a dying per&s;on I freely forgive them.</P>
<P>I return my &s;incere thanks to the Hon. gentlemen who were my Judges, for a&s;|&s;igning me coun&s;el, and to them for their kindne&s;s in pleading my cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I likewi&s;e return my hearty thanks to the &s;everal Mini&s;ters of the town, who have attended me &s;ince I have been under &s;entence: al&s;o to a number of other kind friends, for the care they have &s;hewn to me, both for &s;oul and body, which grati|tude obliges me to acknowledge. May God reward them all for their kindne&s;s to me.</P>
<P>And now, into the hands of Almighty God I commit my &s;oul, relying on his mercy, through the merits and mediation of my Redeemer, and die an unworthy member of the Pre&s;byterian Church, in the 29th year of my age.</P>
