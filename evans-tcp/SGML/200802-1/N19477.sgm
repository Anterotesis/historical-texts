<BIBL>2 CORINTHIANS, i. 14.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>As al&s;o you have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye al&s;o are ours, in the day of the</HI> LORD JESUS.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MANY and great are the changes which come to pa&s;s in the natural and moral world; and as far as they fall under our view, are carefully to be regarded. Such as are of a &s;ingular nature, which &s;eldom happen, and are intere&s;ting to us, in our &s;everal relations and particular connexions, de&s;erve &s;pecial notice.</P>
<P>Religious combinations are the more import|ant. Mutual duties are incumbent on all the members; and none more &s;o than tho&s;e between Pa&s;tor and Flock, Mini&s;ter and People. Changes, therefore, among them, call for a wi&s;e and relig|ious improvement. Serious and &s;olemn reflec|tions will become all in that relation, and e&s;pecial|ly tho&s;e who have long been &s;o, who have &s;een a variety of changes in the cour&s;e of providence.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="025379_0003_0FCEDA3E989434B0">
As I have &s;tood in the relation of Pa&s;tor to the Flock of GOD in this place, for about thirty years; and half a century, or fifty complete years, have rolled away &s;ince I was fir&s;t introduced into that &s;acred office, though not now in the relation of Pa&s;tor, yet, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, would willingly call up your attention to matters of the greate&s;t importance to tho&s;e who attended my mini&s;try, and e&s;pecially to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The words which have been read, will afford matter of in&s;truction, coun&s;el, caution, and di|rection, to tho&s;e in that relation; how they &s;hould conduct, what they may rea&s;onably expect, and the happy con&s;equences to them that are faithful.</P>
<P>Let us attend a little &s;eriou&s;ly; and may the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit of CHRIST a&s;&s;i&s;t and influence both &s;peaker and hearers to a right improvement of what may be delivered, that our pre&s;ent meeting may not be lo&s;t time to any of us.</P>
<P>Our text was penned by Paul, the Apo&s;tle and Mini&s;ter of JESUS CHRIST, who &s;tood in &s;ome particular relation to the Church in Corinth. He and they had mutual concerns with each other in that relation.</P>
<P>Having founded a Church there, and &s;pent a year and a half in preaching the Go&s;pel there, he left them and travelled el&s;ewhere. But hearing of things ami&s;s, he wrote to them, to in&s;truct and direct them; and al&s;o to vindicate his character from divers imputations, charged upon him by the fal&s;e apo&s;tles, and to defend him&s;elf and apo&s;tle&s;hip again&s;t &s;ome that brought both him|&s;elf and it into di&s;grace and contempt. He had
<PB N="5" REF="025379_0004_0FCEDA3F8DBDD668">
been greatly admired, approved of, and care&s;&s;|ed; but now finds his intere&s;t in their affections cooling: They had not the &s;ame good opinion of him as formerly. Though they had been in|&s;tructed by his mini&s;try, and greatly profited, yet now it &s;eems they were unea&s;y and di&s;&s;atisfied, and charged him with faults and mi&s;takes that he had never committed. Probably his plain|ne&s;s and faithfulne&s;s in his friendly reproof and coun&s;el, was the occa&s;ion. Be that as it may; it greatly grieved and affected this good man. He was much troubled and afflicted; and he vindi|cates his innocency, profe&s;&s;es his integrity, and appeals to them that they <HI>had</HI> acknowledged him, and had no rea&s;on to do otherwi&s;e <HI>now,</HI> and be|lieved they would acknowledge him, and that he &s;hould be the occa&s;ion of <HI>their rejoicing,</HI> as he doubted not that they would be of <HI>his, in the day of the</HI> LORD JESUS. <HI>As al&s;o you have acknowl|edged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye al&s;o are ours, in the day of the</HI> LORD JESUS.</P>
<P>Our Apo&s;tle believed that he him&s;elf &s;hould be approved of in the great reckoning day, and that &s;ome of them would then be the crown of his rejoicing, and he of theirs. By <HI>day of the</HI> LORD JESUS is intended &s;ome &s;pecial and re|markable day. The day of the final judgment is &s;uch a day. It is the winding up and fitting all things for eternity. It is the great and nota|ble day of the LORD. As mankind will have &s;omething to do on that day, great are the events of it. Our Apo&s;tle had it in his view, and re|minded his chri&s;tian Corinthians of it. He and
<PB N="6" REF="025379_0005_0FCEDA4114BD5380">
they &s;tood in &s;ome &s;pecial relation; they had &s;pecial connexions; and the tran&s;actions of that day, would, in &s;ome re&s;pects, be otherwi&s;e to them than to others.</P>
<P>There is a debt of reciprocal duty, love, and e&s;|teem, due from Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters to their People in this world. They have opportunity of doing and receiving good from each other; they are therefore often to meet together for &s;olemn &s;ocial wor&s;hip. There are peculiar duties and privi|leges between them: And they mu&s;t meet one another before CHRIST'S tribunal, at the day of judgment. Their pre&s;ent meeting will be very different from that.</P>
<P>Here they meet often; there is occa&s;ion for it; it is nece&s;&s;ary, a commanded duty, to meet from Sabbath to Sabbath, and at other times, for the wor&s;hip of GOD, and the &s;ervices of the &s;anc|tuary; and they meet to part and meet again. Here they meet to attend the u&s;e of means for the awakening of &s;inners, and the comfort of &s;aints; for the in&s;tructing of the ignorant, and re&s;olving, the doubting; for the healing of difficulties, and &s;ettling of controver&s;ies; al&s;o for the ap|plying of the divine rule, that &s;aints may be quickened to greater diligence in the ways of godline&s;s, and better prepared for eternal happi|ne&s;s. In the great day of accounts it will be otherwi&s;e. There will then be no u&s;e of means to effect any change in per&s;ons' &s;tate. The &s;in|ner will remain under the guilt of &s;in, and the &s;aint happy and ble&s;&s;ed forever. All things will be &s;ettled for eternity. Here they remain, many
<PB N="7" REF="025379_0006_0FCEDA4339E8FF38">
times, un&s;ettled, and little notice taken of the means u&s;ed for their &s;afety. In the great day of accounts the end of their meeting will be very different: To give up an account of their be|haviour towards one another in that relation. Mini&s;ters <HI>watch for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> as tho&s;e who mu&s;t give an account.</HI> They are Amba&s;&s;adors for CHRIST, and mu&s;t render to him an account of their emba&s;&s;y; what they have done; what reception they have met with; what &s;ucce&s;s they have had; and how the matter &s;tands between their Ma&s;ter and them: And this will be done, in the pre&s;ence of their People, before the great JUDGE.</P>
<P>Faithful Mini&s;ters will give up an account with joy, concerning tho&s;e who have given them a kind entertainment. Tho&s;e who have acknowl|edged them in their office, &s;hall be the occa&s;ion of great joy. <HI>We are your rejoicing, even as ye are ours.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, faithful Mini&s;ters will give an account of the ill treatment they have met with, from any who have not acknowledged them, but have &s;lighted and de&s;pi&s;ed them, mi&s;u&s;ed and abu&s;ed them, and di&s;regarded the me&s;&s;ages brought to them: They will witne&s;s again&s;t &s;uch to their confu&s;ion and condemnation.</P>
<P>On the other hand: If Mini&s;ters have been unfaithful, and betrayed the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them; if they have neglected the duty of their office; their people will ri&s;e up again&s;t them, and be &s;wift witne&s;&s;es to their everla&s;ting perdition.</P>
<P>This is one end of their meeting. Another is, that the LORD JESUS may judge between them,
<PB N="8" REF="025379_0007_0FCEDA44157E2AB0">
and &s;ettle all di&s;putes that have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them here. It ofttimes happens that controver|&s;ies ari&s;e between Mini&s;ters and their People: Sometimes to a very great degree, and of long continuance. Sometimes the fault is on the one part, and &s;ometimes on the other, and &s;ometimes in both. Sometimes the&s;e di&s;putes are decided in this world, and ofttimes by party and preju|dice, and ofttimes remain undetermined. But in the great day of accounts there will be a full, per|fect, ju&s;t, and upright deci&s;ion; and then it will be known who is in the right, and who is in the wrong. All controver&s;ies will be &s;ettled forever.</P>
<P>And then they will receive &s;entence, in the pre&s;ence of each other, according to their beha|viour here. Ju&s;tice will then take place upon all per&s;ons. He who has done well &s;hall be reward|ed, and he who has done ill &s;hall be condemned. <HI>Every man &s;hall then receive the reward of his la|bour.</HI></P>
<P>Faithful Mini&s;ters &s;hall be abundantly reward|ed. <HI>They that be wi&s;e, &s;hall &s;hine as the bright|ne&s;s of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the &s;tars forever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>And they who have received them, and ap|proved of their me&s;&s;ages, and given a cordial en|tertainment to the offers of the Go&s;pel, as made to them, &s;hall be amply rewarded al&s;o.</P>
<P>Such a Mini&s;ter and People &s;hall be each oth|er's <HI>joy and crown of rejoicing in the day of the</HI> LORD JESUS.</P>
<P>On the other hand: Do any ill treat the faith|ful Mini&s;ters of CHRIST; refu&s;e to hearken to
<PB N="9" REF="025379_0008_0FCEDA47CC3E9520">
their me&s;&s;ages delivered in their Ma&s;ter's name, and by his order; do they de&s;pi&s;e and reject them: will <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> not receive them, but refu&s;e to hear their word, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for them. And,</P>
<P>If Mini&s;ters prove them&s;elves unfaithful, neg|lecters of the work and bu&s;ine&s;s of their office, betrayers of their Ma&s;ter's cau&s;e, imbibe corrupt principles, or pur&s;ue ill practices, the righteous Judge will deal out in anger and fiery rebukes. The blood of &s;ouls, lo&s;t through the un&s;kilfulne&s;s and unfaithfulne&s;s of the watchman, &s;hall be re|quired at his hands.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;ugge&s;ted, we learn the near relation and connexion between a Mini&s;ter and the People of his charge, and the reciprocal duties incumbent upon each of them.</P>
<P>Natural relations, as parents and children, are near, intimate, and intere&s;ting; and there is a &s;pecial debt of care, love, e&s;teem, and kindne&s;s, due from them. Civil connexions oblige the parties to particular duties. Every relation has its burdens and comforts: But none equal to tho&s;e in a religious character; and that between Pa&s;tor and People is the more intimate.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;tor is to feed the Flock; the Shepherd to take care of the Sheep; the Steward is to regard the &s;tate of his Hou&s;ehold: Mini&s;ters have great concerns with their People; and they have ma|ny concerns with them. The duty is recip|rocal.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="025379_0009_0FCEDA4ACBA1EBA8">
Mini&s;ters are the Amba&s;&s;adors of CHRIST, and to pray their hearers, in his &s;tead, to be recon|ciled to GOD. So that their office is an office of dig|nity and honour. They are to be re&s;pected and hon|oured by their People; their mini&s;trations are to be attended upon; and the doctrines of the go&s;|pel, as di&s;pen&s;ed by them, carefully regarded. They are to be viewed as the me&s;&s;engers of the LORD of Ho&s;ts.</P>
<P>Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters are under the &s;tronge&s;t obli|gations to faithfulne&s;s. They are to preach the Go&s;pel; keep clo&s;e to their commi&s;&s;ion. The Apo&s;tles did &s;o: <HI>Our exhortation was not of de|ceit, nor of uncleanne&s;s, nor of guile; but as we are allowed of GOD, to be put in tru&s;t with the Go&s;|pel, even &s;o we &s;peak, not as plea&s;ing men, but</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>Let Mini&s;ters then, and the People of their charge, know and fulfil the &s;everal tru&s;ts repo&s;ed in them.</P>
<P>That they &s;tand in a &s;pecial relation, we have already con&s;idered; that there are duties of the greate&s;t concernment, is al&s;o evident; and that events, of the la&s;t importance, under GOD, de|pend upon the faithful di&s;charge of their tru&s;t, is alike manife&s;t. They mu&s;t meet together in the day of judgment, and give account to the Chief Shepherd, how they have conducted here; and there will be &s;omething &s;pecial in the affairs of the judgment relative to them, from what it is towards others.</P>
<P>Now it is of the la&s;t importance to the intere&s;t of CHRIST'S kingdom, and e&s;pecially to their &s;ouls' &s;alvation, that they be faithful to GOD, and
<PB N="11" REF="025379_0010_0FCEDA4D551AC560">
to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, and that they di&s;|charge the &s;everal duties incumbent upon them.</P>
<P>Let Mini&s;ters then &s;ee to it, that they be men of GOD. This is of infinite importance with re|gard to them&s;elves. They mu&s;t take heed to them&s;elves, as they would not be ca&s;taways; and to the Flock committed to their charge, as they would be <HI>pure from the blood of all men.</HI> If any are lo&s;t through their neglect, their blood will be required of them. And that none may, through their faulty neglect, they mu&s;t be men of learning, judgement, &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, patience, pru|dence, and of exemplary holine&s;s. They need to be men of integrity, truth, and righteou&s;ne&s;s; men of wi&s;dom; &s;kilful in the affairs of &s;alva|tion; full of affection towards the &s;ouls of men, and of long &s;uffering towards all men. They ought to watch for &s;ouls; &s;eek all opportunities for their &s;afety; do good to all as they have oc|ca&s;ion; and willingly <HI>give no offence, that the mini&s;try be not blamed: But in all things approv|ing them&s;elves as the Mini&s;ters of</HI> CHRIST.</P>
<P>So our Apo&s;tle did. He could appeal to GOD, to his con&s;cience, to his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and to all the people, in the &s;everal places where he had preached, that he preached the truth, plain truth, and nece&s;&s;ary truth. And his life was a tran|&s;cript of his preaching.</P>
<P>Happy for tho&s;e Mini&s;ters, thus animated and influenced, to conduct in &s;uch an holy, exampla|ry, wi&s;e, and prudent manner.</P>
<P>Let People al&s;o &s;ee how they conduct towards their Mini&s;ters. They &s;hould treat them with
<PB N="12" REF="025379_0011_0FCED9E424FB3190">
kindne&s;s; &s;peak highly of their office; view them as the Amba&s;&s;adors of CHRIST. They &s;hould be ready and willing to receive the truths of the Go&s;pel from their lips; acknowledge them as lights of the world; give their me&s;&s;ages a cor|dial entertainment; and remember, when they have to deal with them, they have to deal with CHRIST'S me&s;&s;engers, and that they mu&s;t meet them in the great reckoning day, and give an ac|count how they have heard and received, how they have attended and regarded, or how they have rejected and de&s;pi&s;ed, the calls and invita|tions, the coun&s;els and in&s;tructions, the warn|ings and reproofs, which have been &s;et before them.</P>
<P>Certainly faithful Mini&s;ters, in the wi&s;e and prudent di&s;charge of their office, de&s;erve a kind reception, a welcome entertainment, and not to be reproached and vilified.</P>
<P>Says holy Flavel, "Your re&s;pect to them is founded upon their office and employments for you. They watch for your &s;ouls: Dare any of you watch for their halting, for their ruin? They bring glad tidings: Shall they return with &s;ad tidings to him that &s;ent them? They publi&s;h peace: Shall they be rewarded with trouble? O ungrateful world! what a &s;trange challenge was that, <HI>Which of all the prophets have not your fa|thers per&s;ecuted?</HI> The office of the mini&s;try &s;peaks the abundant love of GOD to you; your abu&s;e of it &s;peaks the abundant malignity of your hearts towards him. It was a &s;ad prote&s;tation of Jeremi|ah again&s;t an ungrateful people; <HI>Shall evil be
<PB N="13" REF="025379_0012_0FCEDA500C247D70">
recompen&s;ed for good? For they have digged a pit for my &s;oul. Remember, that I &s;tood before thee, to &s;peak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them.</HI>"</P>
<P>LET us proceed to bring the&s;e matters home to <HI>our&s;elves,</HI> and &s;ee what intere&s;t we have in them. It is of va&s;t importance that we be right|ly in&s;tructed, our con&s;ciences awake, and we wi&s;ely improving the&s;e alarming truths.</P>
<P>My brethren and my friends, you who are of this Chri&s;tian Society, who generally and &s;tatedly have attended the wor&s;hip of GOD in this place; you who were once the People of my charge, how often have &s;ome of us met, in our former hou&s;e, in this relation! How often have I &s;pok|en the word of GOD to &s;ome of you! coun&s;elled and in&s;tructed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted and directed you, in the affairs of religion! How often have I admini&s;ter|ed the holy ordinances of the Go&s;pel to &s;ome of you, as the People of my charge.</P>
<P>About thirty years rolled away, whil&s;t I &s;tood in the relation of Pa&s;tor to the Church and Con|gregation in this town; during which time I en|deavoured to &s;erve your be&s;t intere&s;ts, according to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> capacity. I &s;pent the prime of my life, and the be&s;t of my days, in labouring for your good; and, <HI>through much infirmity</HI> (at lea&s;t as to &s;ome of the time) <HI>preaching the Go&s;pel unto you.</HI> For <HI>I was with you in weakne&s;s, and in fear, and in much trembling.</HI></P>
<P>As to tho&s;e of you who were the fir&s;t, and after builders up of this &s;ociety, and did contiune with me
<PB N="14" REF="025379_0013_0FCEDA518ACFCAB0">
in my mini&s;try, how often have we met together! Sometimes in kind, friendly vi&s;its, for cultivating good neighbourhood, and &s;trengthening affections.</P>
<P>How often have I been with &s;ome of you in your days of trouble and di&s;tre&s;s, when a cloud was drawn over your tabernacles, you filled with bitterne&s;s, and made to drink the wine of a&s;toni&s;hment: When &s;ickne&s;s &s;eized you; when death brake in upon you; when &s;ome of your deare&s;t friends, and &s;weete&s;t enjoyments, were removed from you; when di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h were ready to everwhelm you! I then endeav|oured to admini&s;ter relief and comfort to you, and gave you the be&s;t in&s;tructions and coun&s;els that I was capable of. And you have been with me when I my&s;elf was <HI>the man</HI> who &s;aw <HI>affliction by the rod of</HI> GOD'S <HI>wrath; when he led me, and brought me into darkne&s;s, and not into light.</HI></P>
<P>I have been with many of you in private, in conver&s;ing with you re&s;pecting the great and im|portant concerns of your &s;ouls, to lead and a&s;&s;i&s;t you in your &s;olemn publick engagements, when you covenanted with GOD and his People, in publick manner.</P>
<P>How often have I been with &s;ome of you, in our former hou&s;e, for the wor&s;hip of GOD, and an attendance upon the ordinances of the Go&s;pel, that by them we might be quickened and com|forted, &s;tabli&s;hed and &s;trengthened, in the ways of godline&s;s!</P>
<P>What plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction did it yield, when the bonds of friend&s;hip were &s;trengthened; when the peace and comfort of the community was
<PB N="15" REF="025379_0014_0FCEDA55F69D4AF0">
greatly promoted; and e&s;pecially when the power and grace of CHRIST were manife&s;ted, his gra|cious pre&s;ence and kind influences abundantly di&s;played! What plea&s;ant, comfortable meeting to &s;ome of us, (I appeal to your con&s;ciences whether you have not &s;ometimes found it &s;o) when you &s;at under the &s;hadow of CHRIST'S or|dinances, and found the fruit of them &s;weet to your ta&s;te; when GOD &s;pake peace to your &s;ouls, and let in divine light and joy into your hearts!</P>
<P>Thus I have been with &s;ome of you, and ac|cording to the grace given me, I cared for you in my preaching; I &s;tudied to find <HI>out acceptable words, even words of wi&s;dom,</HI> and kept nothing back which I judged would be profitable for you.</P>
<P>Thus, I &s;ay, we have met together, &s;ome few of us, at lea&s;t, for the &s;pace of about thirty years; though but few for that period; the greater part not half that term; and &s;ome of you for a few years only. But now &s;uch opportunities are at an end, never to return again, in the character and connexion of Pa&s;tor and Flock. That relation is now di&s;&s;olved. Full twenty years have rolled away &s;ince. And verily &s;uch opportuni|ties of meeting were at an end, as to many of my charge, before my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. For death, and a removal of habitation, had greatly changed the People of my charge. Only two of the fir&s;t fam|ilies remained, with both their heads living, a|mong us; and thirteen members of the church were removed, mo&s;tly by death; and above forty per&s;ons that were or had been heads of families. Their days were numbered before my pa&s;toral re|lation

to you cea&s;ed. O, how &s;wift are the wings of time to ha&s;ten us into the invi&s;ible world! Our natural, civil, and religious connexions will &s;oon cea&s;e. We are all ha&s;tening into eternity.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s my day of life will &s;oon be ended! The graves are ready for me! I am now in the &s;eventy third year of my age, and labouring under many and growing infirmities. Shortly, very &s;hortly, this month, which has often &s;poken to you the words of life, will be filled with gravel; the&s;e eyes, that now &s;ee you, clo&s;ed in death; this hand, which has admini&s;tered the water of holy bapti&s;m, to a great number of you, will be withering in the rotting grave; this body locked up in that <HI>hou&s;e appointed for all living;</HI> and the &s;pirit a&s;cend to the SUPREME JUDGE, to re|ceive the deeds done in the body. How &s;olemn the thought! How affecting the con&s;ideration! How worthy of attention! I &s;hall then have no more concern with any of you in this world; and perhaps &s;ome of you who have been the People of my charge, may be ready to think we &s;hall never have concern with each other again. But, dear brethren, let us remember, that after all, there will be another meeting, and in another manner, and for other purpo&s;es; to give up an account how we have conducted towards each other in the relation of Pa&s;tor and People. Let us think of the awfulne&s;s and &s;olemnity of that day, when all things will be &s;ettled for eternity. Let us lay in for a happy meeting then, that it may be foun|dation of plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction, of joy and con|&s;olation. Let us therefore now review our pa&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="025379_0016_0FCEDA5AC4693A08">
conduct, and &s;ee what has been ami&s;s; repent, and reform. Let us know our pre&s;ent temper; that it be agreeable to the divine will. And let our future con|ver&s;ation and conduct be holy and without blame.</P>
<P>Many things have been out of place, I doubt not, in our various relations and connexions, and many things ami&s;s in this.</P>
<P>When I view my own conduct, as a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, and &s;ee the many defects and fail|ures; the many mi&s;takes and imprudencies; and the many culpable deficiencies; and then think of appearing before the SUPREME JUDGE, in the great audit day, how is my heart &s;oftened, and my &s;oul filled with &s;hame and blu&s;hing! And were it not that the blood of JESUS was &s;hed for the Prie&s;thood, as well as the Congregation, confu&s;ion would cover me: But I de&s;ire to be &s;prinkled with that blood, and found under the REDEEMER'S wings, and look for pardon, relief, and &s;afety, through him. May I be <HI>your rejoicing, in the day of the</HI> LORD JESUS.</P>
<P>And you, my brethren, the children of GOD, who have been enlightened by his word, and quickened by his SPIRIT; who have ta&s;ted the &s;weets of divine ordinances, as admini&s;tered by me; and have been built up thereby, in the di|vine life, and have been comforted; you will be led to ble&s;s God for his goodne&s;s, and &s;till love the means of in&s;truction, and &s;eek for further &s;atisfaction and con&s;olation.</P>
<P>You who are members of this Church, and have covenanted with GOD and one another, will be plea&s;ed to remember the bonds of the covenant
<PB N="18" REF="025379_0017_0FCEDA5C2BE820A8">
are &s;acred, and may not be ea&s;ily broken without &s;in. You will therefore be prevailed upon, to ful|fil them with care and diligence.</P>
<P>You who have received the initiating &s;eal by bapti&s;m, as admini&s;tered by me; (and, how many of that number! more than &s;ixty of them in fam|ilies!) you, my young friends, will con&s;ider that you are bound to the &s;ervice of GOD, and &s;tand in a particular relation to this Church; and it be|comes you to fulfil your bapti&s;mal engagements, and walk circum&s;pectly. You will not &s;uddenly nor ea&s;ily be removed from your belief of the validity of your bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>You who have attended with us, and purpo&s;e, as well as are bound, to attend the publick wor&s;hip, and the publick ordinances, in this place, as di&s;|pen&s;ed by your pre&s;ent Pa&s;tor, will endeavour to attend with diligence and con&s;tancy; will de&s;ire to gain in&s;truction and further in&s;ight into the great truths and duties of our holy religion, and to be built up a &s;piritual hou&s;e, to offer to GOD &s;piritual &s;acri|fices, acceptable by JESUS CHRIST. You will, therefore, earne&s;tly de&s;ire to experience the power of divine grace, the plea&s;ures of the divine life, and the joys of the &s;aints; and will &s;trive to live and act, at all times, agreeable to the rules of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>If any have been carele&s;s &s;ouls, and yet remain &s;o, let them know, it will be a dreadful meeting in the day of judgment, if they remain in their &s;ins, and unconcerned for the divine honour.</P>
<P>And may awakened &s;ouls &s;ee to it that they do not &s;tifle convictions; that they are built upon the rock CHRIST; that they take up with noth|ing
<PB N="19" REF="025379_0018_0FCEDA5D9A35DE90">
&s;hort of heavenly grace; with nothing &s;hort of an heart moulded into the temper of CHRIST; with nothing &s;hort of a go&s;pel faith, and go&s;pel holine&s;s.</P>
<P>What &s;hall I &s;ay more? I have already tre&s;|pa&s;&s;ed upon your patience. Love to your &s;ouls, who&s;e happine&s;s I earne&s;tly de&s;ire now, as well as when I &s;tood in the pa&s;toral relation, has con|&s;trained me.</P>
<P>Though it is more than time I had done, yet I know not how to di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject, until I have offered &s;omething to the Congregation at large; to this whole Society.</P>
<P>Great are the changes that have happened a|mong us, &s;ince my fir&s;t appearing as a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel. Fifty complete years have rolled away. On &s;uch an occa&s;ion &s;uffer me to recol|lect, and hold up to view, &s;ome few of the <HI>remark|ables</HI> which have taken place.</P>
<P>On January 9, 1740&punc; you were incorporated into a town<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Holden was originally Worce&s;ter, north half; It had its name to perpet|uate the memory of the Hon. Samuel Holden, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of London, a great bene|factor to the&s;e Churches.</NOTE>, then few in number, about twenty families. Since which time how are you increa&s;|ed! now about one hundred and &s;eventy: And by the late cen&s;us you were found to be one thou&s;and and &s;eventy &s;even per&s;ons. At fir&s;t your increa&s;e was &s;low; little alteration for the term of five years; but, afterward, the increa&s;e much more; for, at the end of ten years, your number of fam|ilies was fifty five. For the &s;econd ten years, the increa&s;e in families was small, only ten. The la&s;t ten years of my mini&s;try, the increa&s;e was forty one. The whole number, at my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="20" REF="025379_0019_0FCEDA5F41BC7158">
about one hundred and &s;ix families. Not more than five or &s;ix of the fifty five, with both their heads, are living among us. There had been &s;ix hundred and forty two births; about three hundred and thirty were males, and about three hundred and ten were females: The increa&s;e of males about thirty. There have died two hundred and fourteen per&s;ons; about eighty un|der the age of two years; and more than half un|der the age of five.</P>
<P>The number of the baptized, by me, about five hundred and twenty: And &s;ince, by your pre&s;ent Pa&s;tor, four hundred and twenty nine. So that there has been almo&s;t a thou&s;and bapti&s;ms.</P>
<P>The Church, when fir&s;t embodied, con&s;i&s;ted of fourteen males. In the fir&s;t ten years of my min|i&s;try, it increa&s;ed to more than &s;ixty members; of which number there were more males than females, about thirty two of them new members; the re&s;t from other Churches: In which time of ten years, there died nine females, and not one male. Six per&s;ons had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to other Churches.</P>
<P>At the end of twenty years the Church con|&s;i&s;ted of about &s;eventy five members, and when I was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, of eighty &s;ix; thirty eight males; forty eight females. The Church now con&s;i&s;ts of thirty three males, and forty &s;ix females. Dur|ing the thirty years of my mini&s;try there had been fifty four removed from us, &s;ome by di&s;mi&s;&s;ion to other Churches, but mo&s;tly by death.</P>
<P>Seventy one per&s;ons have owned the covenant, under my admini&s;tration, and a like number un|der your pre&s;ent Pa&s;tor's.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="025379_0020_0FCEDA62DD25A3B0">
There was a remarkable &s;ickne&s;s about &s;even years after my &s;ettlement: Twenty two per&s;ons di|ed. And about &s;ix years after, the year after the great earthquake, a raging di&s;temper carried off about forty five per&s;ons in a &s;hort time, mo&s;tly young|er per&s;ons and children.</P>
<P>Soon after my leaving the Mini&s;try among you, you were religiou&s;ly concerned to have the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try re&s;ettled among you; and, be|fore two years rolled away, found, and &s;oon af|ter &s;ettled, your pre&s;ent Pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>May his days be much longer, and his mini&s;|try much more &s;ucce&s;sful, than his predece&s;&s;or's.</P>
<P>You have al&s;o lately erected and fini&s;hed this &s;pacious and well ornamented hou&s;e, for the publick wor&s;hip. May the glory of it be as much greater than the glory of the former hou&s;e, in the be&s;towment of &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, and com|munications, of divine grace, in and with divine ordinances, as it is more magnifical.</P>
<P>And now what &s;hall I &s;ay? Will you, my aged fathers and friends, wake up: Ari&s;e and trim your lamps: Be in earne&s;t to give glory to GOD, <HI>before your feet &s;tumble upon the dark mountains?</HI> The &s;hadows of the evening are &s;treched out to a great length, as to &s;ome of us. The &s;un is near down. The graves are ready for us. A very few &s;ands in the gla&s;s. Let us be thankful that GOD has &s;pared us, when &s;o many of our ancient friends and acquaintances are gone before us; and divers of late. Six of a religious character. The mo&s;t of them were among the fir&s;t builders up of the &s;ociety, and lived in it more than forty
<PB N="22" REF="025379_0021_0FCEDA644ED90298">
years. We have often taken <HI>&s;weet coun&s;el</HI> with them, and gone <HI>to the hou&s;e of</HI> GOD <HI>in company:</HI> But we &s;hall &s;ee their faces here no more. It becomes us to cry with the P&s;almi&s;t. <HI>Help,</HI> LORD, <HI>when the godly cea&s;e, and the faithful <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, from among the children of men!</HI></P>
<P>The widows and the fatherle&s;s have greatly in|creased of late. Many are the mourners that go about the &s;treets. There are at lea&s;t twenty four widows in the &s;ociety, and not more than one widower. Four younger per&s;ons have decea&s;ed in the year pa&s;t; one lately of the &s;mall pox.</P>
<P>We are now beginning a new year. O! my friends, let us be more than ever concerned for the life of that religion, which is the life of our &s;ouls. Let us walk by faith; live upon the promi&s;es; be in earne&s;t for GOD, for religion, and for the welfare of mankind. Let us be much and often in the duties of &s;elf examination, med|itation, and prayer; attending all the means of grace. And may you be your pre&s;ent Pa&s;tor's joy and rejoicing here, and his and mine <HI>in the day of the</HI> LORD JESUS.</P>
<P>May you that are in the middle of life, or ri&s;|ing up in u&s;efulne&s;s, be religiously concerned to live to the divine honour. You have &s;pecial ad|vantages put into your hands. You have the publick mini&s;try, and go&s;pel wor&s;hip, to attend upon. Will not you be careful to improve them to the honour of the REDEEMER, and your own profit and &s;piritual comfort? Why will you not? Let me plead with you to &s;et up and keep up family religion. Are you baptized per&s;ons?
<PB N="23" REF="025379_0022_0FCEDA65D581CC60">
Yes; the mo&s;t of you. Think of your obliga|tions. Have not a number of you bound your|&s;elves by covenant engagements? And why, my friends, &s;hould any be unwilling? Let me en|treat you to love the religion of JESUS. Love the preached word, and publick ordinances of the Go&s;pel. Regard the chri&s;tian Sabbath. Shun all the paths of wickedne&s;s. Cheer and comfort the heart of your pre&s;ent Pa&s;tor. How will he be plea&s;ed and gratified to &s;ee you walking in the truth! May the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD re&s;t upon you; his &s;pirit be poured out in plenty; and you be the cau&s;e of his rejoicing, and he of yours, <HI>in the day of the</HI> LORD JESUS. O think often of that &s;ol|emn day, and let it influence your future conduct!</P>
<P>May the youth, in this place, be di&s;po&s;ed to know, love, and &s;erve the LORD GOD of their fathers; to remember their CREATOR now in youth; become &s;ober minded; &s;hun the ways of vanity; behave virtuou&s;ly; hearken to the in&s;truction of their Parents, Mini&s;ter, Teachers; improve all opportunities to be more and more acquainted with their duty; and lay in betimes for a happy eternity.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;tor of this Church will not take it ami&s;s, if I <HI>&s;tir up his pure mind by way of remem|brance.</HI> He will take heed to him&s;elf and doc|trine, and continue in them, that he may &s;ave him&s;elf and them who hear him. He will re|member, that he <HI>watches for &s;ouls as one who mu&s;t give an account.</HI> He will endeavour to be faith|ful, and wi&s;h to be &s;ucce&s;sful. He will be much in prayer, and concerned to know the &s;tate of his flock. He will be ready to perform every kind
<PB N="24" REF="025379_0023_0FCEDA69796509F8">
office for them; to &s;pend and be &s;pent for the good of &s;ouls. May he have much of the pre&s;|ence of the great Shepherd with him, in all his future mini&s;trations, and much &s;ucce&s;s! And may he and the People of his charge, be each other's rejoicing, in the day of CHRIST JESUS.</P>
<P>And now, dear brethren and friends, I take an affectionate farewel of you, and clo&s;e with my dying wi&s;h. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>ble&s;s you, and keep you: The</HI> LORD <HI>make his face to &s;hine upon you, and be gracious: The</HI> LORD <HI>lift up the light of his coun|tenance, and give you peace.</HI> O! if the SPIRIT of GOD re&s;t upon you, you &s;hall be built up. You will attend the means. May GOD &s;hine upon this &s;anctuary.</P>
<P>I a&s;k an intere&s;t in your prayers, and, once more, &s;ay, <HI>Finally, brethren, farewel in the</HI> LORD. <HI>Be perfect: Be of good comfort: Live in peace: and the</HI> GOD <HI>of love and peace be with you.</HI> May I be your rejoicing, and you mine, <HI>in the day of the</HI> LORD JESUS. Amen.</P>
