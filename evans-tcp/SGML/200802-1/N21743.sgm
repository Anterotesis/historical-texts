<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>JOHN <HI>xviii. 37.</HI></BIBL>
<P>To this end was I born, and for this cau&s;e came I into the world, that I &s;hould bear witne&s;s unto the truth.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE are the words of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. In them he informs us, that one end of his incarnation and mini&s;try was, that by bearing wit|ne&s;s to the truth, he might communicate the knowledge of it. The &s;ame is doubtle&s;s the end of the ordinary mini&s;try of the go&s;pel, and &s;hould be the object aimed at by every Mini&s;ter. From our text therefore I deduce this <HI>doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>The great duty of the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel is, to preach the truth.</P>
<P>Under this doctrine I purpo&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">I. To &s;how what truth mini&s;ters of the go&s;|pel ought to preach.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="4" REF="028618_0003_0FD9C6E487D68010">II. To mention &s;ome rea&s;ons in confirmation of the doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to &s;how what truth a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel ought to preach. Truth is very exten&s;ive and of various kinds. There is truth in every &s;cience, in mathematics, philo&s;ophy, hi&s;tory, &amp;c. It will not be pretended, that mathematical and philo&s;ophical truth is the proper &s;ubject of the evangelical mini&s;try. Nor is hi&s;torical truth, any further than it illu&s;trates the go&s;pel, by exhibiting the facts of it, or other important facts relating to the works and the character of God.</P>
<P>The truth then intended in the doctrine is pri|marily evangelical truth, and &s;econdarily all other truth which relates to the go&s;pel and tends to il|lu&s;trate it; as all truth relating to God and his character, e&s;pecially his moral perfections; all truth relating to his &s;upreme, univer&s;al and &s;ove|reign government; all truth relating to his law, its requirements and threatenings; relating to &s;in, its nature and evil; relating to our&s;elves, our pre|&s;ent fallen &s;tate, and the ruin con&s;equent on the fall; particularly our native and total depravity, our actual &s;ins and the various aggravations of them; our demerit as &s;inners; our dependence on the mere mercy and &s;overeign grace of God; our own moral inability to bring our&s;elves to repentance and holine&s;s of heart and life, and our ab&s;olute in|&s;ufficiency to make &s;atisfaction for our &s;ins; the nece&s;&s;ity of an atonement and one of infinite val|ue, corre&s;pondent to the demerit of our &s;in; the character of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his divinity, his humanity, his offices, his &s;ufferings in our &s;tead, and his readine&s;s to &s;ave &s;inners of
<PB N="5" REF="028618_0004_0FD9C6E80F5B4258">
every de&s;cription, who come to him for this pur|po&s;e; the conditions of his &s;alvation, the privile|ges and rewards of it, and the inevitable con&s;e|quences of a rejection of it.</P>
<P>This is a very brief &s;ummary of the truths, which every mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel is obligated to preach and inculcate.</P>
<P N="2">II. I am to mention &s;ome rea&s;ons in confirma|tion of this doctrine.</P>
<P>The following rea&s;ons &s;how, that mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel are obliged to preach the truth or the real doctrines of &s;cripture.</P>
<P N="1">1. The truth was the &s;ubject of the preaching of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He certainly is a proper example in this, as well as in his common con|duct. He was a perfect preacher. Therefore he is to be imitated by all other preachers. And he in our text, informs us not only that he preached the truth, but that this was one great end of his in|carnation and mini&s;try.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;ame was the &s;ubject of the preaching of the apo&s;tles and prophets. 2 Cor. iv. 2. <Q>We have renounced the hidden things of di&s;hone&s;ty, not walking in craftine&s;s, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manife&s;tation of the <HI>truth</HI> commending our&s;elves to every man's con|&s;cience in the &s;ight of God.</Q> Chap. xiii. 8. <Q>For we can do nothing again&s;t the <HI>truth,</HI> but for the <HI>truth.</HI></Q> Gal. iv. 16. <Q>Am I therefore become your enemy, becau&s;e I tell you the truth?</Q> 1 Tim. ii. 7. <Q>Whereunto I am or|dained
<PB REF="028618_0005_0FD9C6E90B9B2160">
a preacher and an apo&s;tle&mdash;a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and <HI>verity;</HI></Q> i. e. in faith and <HI>truth.</HI></P>
<P>The great bu&s;ine&s;s of the prophets was to declare the word of God, which is the truth, as it was im|mediately taught them, or as they were by God di|rected to repeat former revelations. The great bu|&s;ine&s;s of the apo&s;tles was to preach the go&s;pel, which is the &s;y&s;tem of divine truth given to the church and to the world, in the la&s;t and mo&s;t per|fect di&s;pen&s;ation. Both the prophets and apo&s;tles were in&s;pired by the infallible &s;pirit of God which guided them into all nece&s;&s;ary truth, and pre&s;erved them, in their official proceedings, from every thing incon&s;i&s;tent with it. Under the influence of this &s;pirit they preached the truth and that only.</P>
<P N="3">3. The knowledge of the truth is nece&s;&s;ary to true religion. It is nece&s;&s;ary both to the affections and to the practice of it.</P>
<P N="1">(1) The knowledge of the truth is nece&s;&s;ary to true religious affections.&mdash;The knowledge of the true God is nece&s;&s;ary to the true love of God. That love of God, which implies true virtue and real holine&s;s, is the love of the true God and of the true and real character of God. To love any oth|er than the true character of God, is as really to love a fal&s;e God as to love <HI>Jupiter</HI> or <HI>Dagon.</HI> For in&s;tance to love God as a perfectly holy and wi&s;e God, is a holy affection; but to love him as one who tolerates and connives at &s;in and &s;aves all at la&s;t, whatever their lives and characters be in this world, is a wrong and &s;inful affection. To love God as a benevolent being, aiming at his own
<PB N="7" REF="028618_0006_0FD9C6F0840192E0">
glory con&s;i&s;ting in the good and happine&s;s of the intellectual &s;y&s;tem, is a right and holy affection. But to love him in the idea, that he is aiming at &s;ome partial, private good, or our own particular good only, is no exerci&s;e of true virtue, but a mere love of our&s;elves or of &s;ome party. Therefore we mu&s;t have the knowledge of the truth in this im|portant particular, and ju&s;t ideas of the divine character, in order to the exerci&s;e of true virtue and religion in the love of God.</P>
<P>Similar ob&s;ervations may be made concerning the divine law. If we believe that it forbids and condemns &s;ome &s;ins only, and in that view love it, there is in that love no true religion, but irreligion. If we believe it forbids all &s;in and love it in that view, that is true virtue and religion. If we love the divine law, becau&s;e we believe it denounces &s;ome &s;mall temporary puni&s;hment, and cannot bear it, as threatening an endle&s;s puni&s;hment, we here|by &s;how, that we are not friends, but enemies to the law and the truth.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t believe, that there is a God, or we cannot love him at all. We mu&s;t believe, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Saviour, or we cannot receive and tru&s;t in him as our Saviour. We mu&s;t be|lieve the &s;criptures, or how &s;hall we receive and comply with them? We mu&s;t believe that we are &s;inners, or we can never repent. We mu&s;t believe the atonement, or we &s;hall never depend on it, nor &s;eek forgivene&s;s and &s;alvation on the ground of it. And &s;o with re&s;pect to every other truth of the go&s;pel. We can have no right exerci&s;e or affec|tion in view of any truth, unle&s;s we know and be|lieve that truth.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="8" REF="028618_0007_0FD9C6F086361A68">(2) The knowledge of the truth is nece&s;&s;ary to all genuine religious practice.&mdash;Genuine practice implies genuine affections, and is founded on them. Therefore without repeating, it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that the knowledge of the truth is nece&s;&s;ary to gen|uine religious practice, for the &s;ame rea&s;ons, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to genuine religious affections.</P>
<P>Having thus briefly illu&s;trated the doctrine, and having mentioned &s;ome rea&s;ons in confirmation of it, I proceed to &s;everal inferences, which were in|deed principally intended, in the choice of this &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">1. Hence we &s;ee the groundle&s;&s;ne&s;s of a &s;enti|ment holden and advanced by many in the&s;e days, that it is of no importance what a man's religious creed or &s;entiments are, provided he be an hone&s;t man and &s;incere in his religion.&mdash;Let us examine this &s;entiment.</P>
<P>By an hone&s;t man in this propo&s;ition mu&s;t be meant, either one who is hone&s;t and ju&s;t in matters of property; or one who in his religion profe&s;&s;es and acts as he thinks If the latter be meant, then an hone&s;t man and one who is &s;incere in his reli|gion are the very &s;ame; and then the propo&s;ition now under con&s;ideration is this, that it is of no im|portance what a man's religious &s;entiments are, provided that in his religion he believes as he pro|fe&s;&s;es and does what he believes to be right. But this any man may do, let his religion be what it will. A Papi&s;t, a Mahometan or a Pagan may be equally &s;incere in this &s;en&s;e, as the be&s;t Chri&s;tian: and if this &s;incerity be all which is nece&s;&s;ary in re|ligion; then all kinds of religions, as to that
<PB N="9" REF="028618_0008_0FD9C6F2DE834398">
which is e&s;&s;ential to true religion and the benefits of it, are perfectly alike; and of cour&s;e it is a matter of indifferency which we embrace and which we reject, if we embrace any. But this cannot be reconciled with either &s;cripture or rea&s;on. Many of the ancient wor&s;hippers of Dagon and Baal, and of the gods many and lords many, &s;o called, were very &s;incere and in good earne&s;t in their wor&s;hip; yet they are every where condemned in &s;cripture, as they are al&s;o by the voice of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>But perhaps it will be &s;aid, that in the propo&s;i|tion, that it is of no importance what a man's re|ligious &s;entiments are, provided he be an hone&s;t man and &s;incere in his religion; by hone&s;ty is meant moral hone&s;ty, or ju&s;tice to man in matters of property. If this be intended, then the propo&s;i|tion is this, that ju&s;tice to men together with the forementioned &s;incerity, is the whole of religion. But we &s;ee by what has been &s;aid already, that the forementioned &s;incerity is no part of true religion, and that in this re&s;pect it is ju&s;t nothing at all. Therefore if ju&s;tice to men with this &s;incerity be the whole of religion; as this &s;incerity is no part of true religion, the whole of it mu&s;t center in mere ju&s;tice to men. But this cannot be reconci|led with either &s;cripture or rea&s;on. The &s;cripture requires us to render not only unto Ce&s;ar the things which are Ce&s;ar's, but al&s;o unto God, the things which are God's: and the Jews in the time of the prophet Malachi, were &s;everely reproved for having robbed God. Mal. ii. 8. <Q>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye &s;ay, wherein have we robbed thee? In tythes and offerings.</Q> Yea, the &s;cripture requires us to
<PB N="10" REF="028618_0009_0FD9C6F5D84030E0">
love the Lord our God with all our heart. And it is perfectly rational, that if he be &s;upremely great, good and glorious; if he be our Creator, our chief and con&s;tant benefactor; he &s;hould be the object of our fir&s;t and chief regard. So that ju&s;tice to men and a mere moral life, are &s;o far from the whole of religion, that they are not the principal part of it.</P>
<P>That it is of no importance what a man's reli|gious &s;entiments are, is &s;o far from the truth, that nothing is more manife&s;t, than that tho&s;e &s;enti|ments mu&s;t daily influence his religious feelings and affections, and con&s;equently his practice. If a man believe, that he is dependant on divine grace for a renovation, &s;anctification and forgivene&s;s, this naturally tends to humble him. But if he believe, that he is in no need of divine grace in any of the&s;e re&s;pects, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily feel &s;o far &s;elf-&s;ufficient, &s;o far independent, and con&s;equent|ly mu&s;t be &s;piritually proud and &s;elf-righteous. If he believe the nece&s;&s;ity of the atonement of Chri&s;t; this powerfully per&s;uades him to look thither and to place his dependence there. If he believe not the nece&s;&s;ity of the atonement, we may be &s;ure he will depend on &s;ome other foundation. If he be|lieve, that God will pardon, and is by his own in|finite goodne&s;s bound to pardon, any &s;inner in con|&s;equence of his repentance merely, without a Medi|ator; he will certainly neglect Chri&s;t as the Me|diator. But if he believe, that a Mediator is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and that there is no other name but that of Chri&s;t, given under heaven among men, whereby we can be &s;aved, what can more &s;trong|ly urge him to receive and tru&s;t in Chri&s;t? Thus as a man thinketh in his heart, &s;o is he; &s;uch is
<PB REF="028618_0010_0FD9C6FB11376CC8">
his real character; and no man can commonly be expected to be better than his principles.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence we &s;ee the mi&s;take of tho&s;e who hold, that we need not know much of the doctrines of chri&s;tianity; that it is not u&s;eful either for the purpo&s;e of conviction to &s;inners or edification to &s;aints, that &s;uch knowledge rather tends to &s;tifle and prevent both conviction and edification; that we may be ju&s;t as good chri&s;tians without that knowledge as with it; yea better, becau&s;e it rath|er ob&s;tructs chri&s;tian experience and exerci&s;e, and quenches chri&s;tian zeal and fervour.</P>
<P>But on candid examination it will be found, that this is a great mi&s;take; and that the knowl|edge of divine truth is of a mo&s;t happy tendency both to the conviction of &s;inners and the edifica|tion of &s;aints. Certainly the knowledge of the ex|i&s;tence and character of God, of his holine&s;s and his will, of his law and of our violations of it, of the righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s of the law, of the puni&s;hment and evil of &s;in, of the grace of the go&s;|pel and of our neglect of that grace, mo&s;t directly tends to produce and increa&s;e conviction. Indeed genuine conviction cannot exi&s;t without knowl|edge of this kind; and whatever fear or terror, without the knowledge of the truth, exi&s;ts in any man's mind, which &s;ome call conviction, is mere enthu&s;ia&s;m and not genuine conviction.</P>
<P>The knowledge of the truth is equally u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary to edification as to conviction. The nece&s;&s;ity of it to this, I before endeavoured to il|lu&s;trate. How can we love God, if we know him not? or believe in Chri&s;t, without the knowledge
<PB REF="028618_0011_0FD9C6FE8AB0D4E8">
or him? and &s;o in every in&s;tance of chri&s;tian ex|erci&s;e. And the more we know of God, the more opportunity and the greater motives we have, to love, fear and &s;erve him. The more we know of his glorious maje&s;ty and &s;overeignty, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">he grea<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> motive we have to adore, prai&s;e and &s;ubmit to him. The more the chri&s;tian knows of the divine law, the more will he naturally delight in it after the inward man. The more he knows of Chri&s;t, his grace, &s;ufficiency and fulne&s;s, the more will he re|joice and tru&s;t in him. And &s;o with re&s;pect to all divine truth. Ju&s;t as a man, who has a ta&s;te for mu&s;ic, or poetry, or the fine arts in general, is more delighted, the more he is in&s;tructed in tho&s;e arts, and his ta&s;te for them and for their peculiar and mo&s;t delightful excellencies, is the more in|crea&s;ed.</P>
<P>So that there is no foundation for the imagin|ation, that the knowledge of chri&s;tian doctrines tends to ob&s;truct either conviction or edification. Indeed that kind of conviction and edification, which is not built on the foundation of the truth, but of imagination, is ob&s;tructed by the knowledge of the truth and will naturally be aboli&s;hed by it. And the &s;ooner &s;uch conviction and edification are aboli&s;hed, the better, as they are not favourable to true religion, but to enthu&s;ia&s;m and fal&s;e relgion, which &s;o far as they obtain, lead a&s;tray from the foot&s;teps of the flock, and this &s;traying may be fa|tal to the &s;oul.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence we infer the duty of all, who live un|der the light of the go&s;pel, diligently to &s;tudy the doctrines of it and of the whole word of God.&mdash; This is the way to know more of God, of his law,
<PB N="13" REF="028618_0012_0FD9C701CE15D1D8">
of his will, of Chri&s;t and of the free and infinite grace of God, and the way to greater joy in them and conformity to them. This is the way to know more of our own vilene&s;s as &s;inners, and to be more humble in the view of it. This is the way to know more of our duty and of the motives to the performance of it. But the knowledge of all the&s;e objects tends mo&s;t directly to our edification in the chri&s;tian life.</P>
<P N="4">4. E&s;pecially are mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel under obligation to the careful &s;tudy of its doctrines. Their principal bu&s;ine&s;s, as has been attempted to be illu&s;trated, is to preach and teach the truth. But how &s;hall they be able to teach the truth, if they be ignorant of it them&s;elves? And the knowl|edge of it is to be obtained in no other way, than by a diligent &s;tudy of the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, they ought to &s;eek their own edifica|tion. They are at lea&s;t under equal obligation to this, as other men. Nay, their obligation is great|er, in proportion to their greater advantages for edification, and the greater advantage which their own edification gives them, to promote that of others.</P>
<P>Yet not only are &s;ome mini&s;ters too negligent of this duty of thoroughly &s;tudying the doctrines of &s;cripture; but &s;ome de&s;ignedly avoid it. They mean to preach <HI>practically</HI> and not to puzzle their people with <HI>deep</HI> doctrines. No doubt that preach|ing which is truly practical, is the be&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful. But that a mini&s;ter may preach practical|ly and mo&s;t u&s;efully, it is not nece&s;&s;ary, that he be ignorant of the doctrines of the go&s;pel; nor is it
<PB N="14" REF="028618_0013_0FD9C70356ACBBB8">
nece&s;&s;ary, that he &s;hould not preach tho&s;e doctrines. That is the mo&s;t practical preaching, which mo&s;t happily conduces to promote chri&s;tian experience and practice&punc; and that preaching mo&s;t happily conduces to promote the&s;e, which is founded on the truth and which urges all the motives and argu|ments, which the truth affords, to excite to chri&s;|tian experience and practice; and any other argu|ments that the&s;e are not proper to be urged, nor do they on the whole lead to chri&s;tian experience and practice, but to enthu&s;ia&s;m, and ultimately to irreligion and infidelity.</P>
<P>Some &s;eem to conceive, that it is a mini&s;ter's du|ty to <HI>exhort</HI> only, and urge and pre&s;s his hearers to become and to live as chri&s;tians. But are the&s;e exhortations to be pre&s;&s;ed with motives drawn from the truth or from fal&s;ehood? The latter will not be pretended; and as there is no medium in the ca&s;e, they mu&s;t be pre&s;&s;ed with arguments drawn from the truth only. And in order to this the truth mu&s;t be known, mu&s;t be &s;earched out by &s;tu|dy, and mu&s;t be taught; which is the very thing for which I plead. The mind cannot be rational|ly per&s;uaded by any other means, than by argu|ments drawn from the truth; nor indeed ought it.</P>
<P>Therefore for a mini&s;ter to neglect his &s;tudies, on this principle, that the knowledge of divine truth is not nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful to enable him to preach practically and u&s;efully, is to proceed on ground that will by no means &s;upport him. The only truly practical and u&s;eful preaching is that which is founded on the truth and is enforced with arguments drawn from it; and to &s;uch
<PB N="15" REF="028618_0014_0FD9C70691BC8AE8">
preaching a knowledge and diligent &s;tudy of the truths and doctrines of the go&s;pel, are nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>For a mini&s;ter to neglect the &s;tudy of tho&s;e truths from <HI>indolence,</HI> is &s;till wor&s;e; it is inexcu&s;able. Mini&s;ters are bound to be at lea&s;t as indu&s;trious as other men, and many arguments might be men|tioned why they &s;hould, if their health admit, be &s;till more indu&s;trious.</P>
<P>But it is to be feared, that &s;ome neglect &s;tudy on a &s;till different principle. They are afraid, that if they &s;tudy thoroughly and attend to what has been or may be &s;aid on certain important &s;ubjects, they &s;hall be convinced, that tho&s;e doctrines are true, which in &s;ome places are extremely unpopu|lar. Therefore they do not wi&s;h to be convinced of their truth, and will not attend to them, le&s;t they &s;hould be convinced; or le&s;t they &s;hould be under a nece&s;&s;ity of giving their opinion concerning them, and thus expo&s;e them&s;elves to the cen&s;ure of one party or the other, either the advocates or the op|po&s;ers of tho&s;e doctrines. For this rea&s;on they will not read tho&s;e books, in which tho&s;e doctrines are contained, nor conver&s;e much with tho&s;e per|&s;ons, who hold them. And if they be a&s;ked their opinion, they make this apology for not giving it, that they have not read the books, nor examined the arguments relating to tho&s;e doctrines: and of &s;et purpo&s;e they avoid to do either.</P>
<P>Now can this be ju&s;tified? What is this but &s;hutting their eyes again&s;t the light? And how can this be done with a good con&s;cience? Are we not commanded to <Q>prove all things, and to hold fa&s;t that which is good?</Q>&mdash;Be&s;ides; this conduct
<PB N="16" REF="028618_0015_0FD9C70AD30D8488">
argues a want of liberality of &s;entiment, and a con|tractedne&s;s, which it is pre&s;umed, they who act in this manner, would not wi&s;h to have imputed to them. A man of true liberality of &s;entiment and feeling, is willing to hear both &s;ides of every im|portant que&s;tion, and is not afraid that he &s;hall re|ceive too much light.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence we learn, that it is the duty of mini&s;+ters of the go&s;pel, to preach the truth <HI>plainly</HI> and in a manner that is intelligible to their people in gen|eral.&mdash;I have endeavoured to &s;how, that it is their principal duty to preach the truth: but to preach it in ob&s;cure and unintelligible terms is not very different from not preaching it at all. The words of the apo&s;tle Paul are worthy of notice in this ca&s;e, 1 Cor. xiv. 19. <Q>In the church I had rather &s;peak five words with my under&s;tanding, that with my voice I might teach others al&s;o, than ten thou&s;and words in an unknown tongue.</Q> Nor ought we to be deterred from preaching any e&s;&s;ential truth, by the con&s;ideration, that it is un|popular. Every truth of the go&s;pel in its proper connection is oppo&s;ed to the carnal heart, and with carnal men will be unpopular. Therefore if we proceed on this ground, we mu&s;t &s;uppre&s;s every truth.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;ome preachers, it is confe&s;&s;ed, act an imprudent part. They declare the mo&s;t offen&s;ive truths in the mo&s;t offen&s;ive terms, and in tho&s;e terms, again&s;t which their hearers or many of them are greatly prejudiced, and which they really mi&s;|under&s;tand, having been long accu&s;tomed to affix to them a wrong meaning. This is not to teach the truth; but it is the way to prevent the knowl|edge
<PB N="17" REF="028618_0016_0FD9C70CE3B18AF0">
of it; and the way not to do good but hurt. There are two extremes in this, as in other ca&s;es. One is not to declare important and u&s;eful truth faithfully: the other is to declare it, either in words not under&s;tood in the &s;en&s;e, in which they are u|&s;ed by the &s;peaker, or before the hearers are pre|pared to receive it, by having learnt other truths nece&s;&s;ary previou&s;ly to be known.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is the &s;entiment and doctrine of &s;ome, that on all di&s;putable points, mini&s;ters &s;hould preach in &s;cripture language; that this would be a happy way to avoid all di&s;putes in religion: that all public formulas, creeds, confe&s;&s;ions and doctrines of faith, &s;hould be drawn up in &s;cripture-language entirely; that thus chri&s;tians would be agreed, and di&s;&s;en|tions, parties and &s;eparations would be at an end.&mdash; Let us con&s;ider this matter.&mdash;It is &s;aid that on <HI>di&s;|putable points</HI> mini&s;ters &s;hould preach in &s;cripture-language only. But all the peculiar and the mo&s;t important doctrines of the go&s;pel are di&s;putable. And &s;hall mini&s;ters do nothing toward teaching tho&s;e doctrines, be&s;ide reading the &s;criptures to their people? All who can read, as all, or almo&s;t all among us can, may read them for them&s;elves. Yet the &s;entiment now under con&s;ideration will come to this, that mini&s;ters are to do nothing to|ward public in&s;truction, be&s;ide publicly reading the &s;criptures. For if they mu&s;t u&s;e &s;cripture-lan|guage only on all the mo&s;t important &s;ubjects, why not on all the le&s;s important? What advantage is there in deviating from the words of &s;cripture in the latter ca&s;e, more than in the former? And if one word, which is not &s;criptural, may be u&s;ed in the pulpit, why not another? and where &s;hall we fix the limits.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="028618_0017_0FD9C7101254BFC0">Be&s;ides this &s;entiment will not only exclude from the pulpit all words and phra&s;es, which are not u|&s;ed in &s;cripture; but it will confine us to u&s;e the words of &s;cripture in the very &s;ame order in which they &s;tand in &s;cripture. The de&s;ign of u&s;ing the mere language of &s;cripture is, to alter not the &s;en&s;e of it and to avoid all di&s;putes concerning that &s;en&s;e and concerning the doctrines of chri&s;tianity. But though we u&s;e the words of &s;cripture only, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> if we &s;hift their arrangement, we may alter their &s;en&s;e entirely; and this not only by altering the ar|rangement of the words of particular &s;entences; but by &s;electing and arranging &s;entences them|&s;elves. So that mere u&s;ing &s;cripture words and phra&s;es, whether in preaching or in our public formulas, will not an&s;wer the end intended, unle&s;s we pre&s;erve the exact order, as well as the words of &s;cripture; that is, unle&s;s we merely <HI>read</HI> the &s;cripture.</P>
<P>Some &s;en&s;ible of this con&s;equence of their doc|trine, have avowed it with regard to public for|mulas. But to be con&s;i&s;tent, they mu&s;t avow it with regard to all teaching in religion, and mu&s;t hold, that there &s;hould be no religious in&s;truction, be&s;ide the reading of the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>In defence of this doctrine it has been &s;aid, that the language of &s;cripture was cho&s;en by omni&s;|cience, and is therefore the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible; that it is in vain therefore to attempt to mend or explain it by words of our own choo&s;ing; that we might as well attempt to mend any other of the works of God. But all this goes on the ground of the impropriety of our u&s;ing any other means of religious in&s;truct|ion, than the reading of the &s;criptures; a ground
<PB N="19" REF="028618_0018_0FD9C7124835B328">
on which tho&s;e who u&s;e this rea&s;oning, will not dare to re&s;t their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the alledged ab&s;urdity of explaining the language of &s;cripture, which is &s;aid to be equal to an attempt to mend or improve the other <HI>works</HI> of God; I ob&s;erve, that in a certain &s;en&s;e we may and do daily improve the works of God. No man imagines that there is any impiety or ab&s;urdity in clearing and cultivating his lands, or in grinding his grain into meal and making it into bread. Yet there is as much of both impiety and ab&s;urd|ity in either of the&s;e, as in explaining by the u&s;e of other words, &s;uch texts as the&s;e, <Q>The plowers have plowed on my back and made long their furrows;</Q> and <Q>He that believeth on me as the &s;cripture hath &s;aid, out of his belly &s;hall flow riv|ers of living water.</Q></P>
<P>Though the language of &s;cripture was doubtle&s;s the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible on the whole; yet this does not prove but that other words may be u&s;ed in a variety of in&s;tances, which will better explain the meaning of &s;cripture, at lea&s;t to many particular per&s;ons or &s;ocieties of men, than the words of &s;cripture them|&s;elves. A word or phra&s;e which is very deter|minate in one place or nation, may be very ambig|uous in another. Nor was it po&s;&s;ible for omni&s;|cience it&s;elf to make a &s;election of words, which would not be liable to this inconvenience in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of mankind, any more than it was po&s;|&s;ible for omni&s;cience to give a revelation, which could not be abu&s;ed and perverted by depraved men. Now, when a word or phra&s;e of &s;cripture is become ambiguous in a particular age or country, there is no ab&s;urdity in &s;uppo&s;ing, that this word
<PB REF="028618_0019_0FD9C7165A9D33B0">
or phra&s;e &s;hould be explained by other words or phra&s;es, which in that age and country are not &s;o ambiguous; though with re&s;pect to all ages and all countries, the la&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed words and phra&s;es may not be &s;o clear and u&s;eful, as tho&s;e, which they are u&s;ed in a particular time and place to ex|plain.</P>
<P N="7">7. Hence we infer that mini&s;ters are not bound to preach <HI>plain</HI> things only.&mdash;This is the idea of &s;ome; and that mini&s;ters ought never to meddle with things which are not plain.&mdash;But unle&s;s this be &s;o explained, as to be nothing but what all will grant, it can never be &s;upported. If by plain things, be meant things which are already plain and well known to the hearers, then a mini&s;ter is never to <HI>teach</HI> his people any thing; and he is bound to preach &s;o to them, that they &s;hall not, under his preaching, make the lea&s;t <HI>improvement</HI> in chri&s;tian knowledge; which is ab&s;urd and what no man will undertake to &s;upport. But if by <HI>plain things</HI> be meant, things which are capable of being made plain to the hearers, or which, if they will be attentive and candid, may, by the evidence of rea|&s;on or revelation, be made to appear to be credible and manife&s;t truths; it is granted, that in this &s;en&s;e a mini&s;ter mu&s;t preach plain things only. But the propo&s;ition thus explained, comes to nothing.</P>
<P N="8">8. Al&s;o hence we &s;ee the ab&s;urdity of parents re|fu&s;ing to teach their children any particular &s;en|timents in religion, even tho&s;e which they them|&s;elves believe; and leaving them to judge for them|&s;elves, without any &s;uch in&s;truction. This is ad|vocated and practi&s;ed by &s;ome, on the pretences, that their children have a right of private judg|ment
<PB N="21" REF="028618_0020_0FD9C718448E6D78">
in religion and a liberty of con&s;cience; that teaching them any particular religious &s;entiments would curtail this liberty, would &s;hackle their judgment and their genius, and would prevent im|provement. But the&s;e rea&s;ons, if they prove any thing, prove too much, and &s;o confute them&s;elves. Children grown to a proper age have a right to judge for them&s;elves in politics, as well as religion. They have a right to judge, whether monarchy or democracy, whether a free or a de&s;potic govern|ment be the be&s;t. Al&s;o they have a right to judge for them&s;elves in morals, whether it be be&s;t and obligatory on them, to be temperate and prudent, and to ob&s;erve truth and ju&s;tice in their intercour&s;e with their fellow-men. Yet no man will be tho't to curtail his &s;on's right of private judgment or his liberty of con&s;cience, by teaching him the princi|ples of true civil liberty, or the moral duties of temperance, prudence and ju&s;tice. Nay, our chil|dren at a proper age, have a right to judge for them&s;elves what bu&s;ine&s;s to follow in life and in what manner to carry it on. Yet no man &s;cruples to bring up his &s;on to &s;ome particular bu&s;ine&s;s. Nor does any man imagine, that he curtails the liberty of his &s;on, by educating him for a &s;cholar, an hu&s;bandman or a mechanic. Nor is it ever thought that if parents educate their children to &s;ome particular bu&s;ine&s;s, they cramp their genius or prevent improvement. On the principle which I am con&s;idering, a parent mu&s;t never teach his &s;on any thing. Though he wi&s;h to have him an hu&s;bandman, he mu&s;t never teach him the u&s;e of the plough or &s;cythe; though he wi&s;h to have him a carpenter, he mu&s;t never teach the u&s;e of the &s;aw or chi&s;el; though he wi&s;h to have him a &s;cholar, he mu&s;t never teach him to read or write:
<PB N="22" REF="028618_0021_0FD9C719C36D7CB8">
for the &s;on has the &s;ame right of private judgment concerning the be&s;t mode of reading and writing, and of u&s;ing any kind of uten&s;ils, which he has to judge in matters of religion; and teaching him any of the things ju&s;t mentioned would be as likely to prevent improvement by cramping his genius, as teaching him the principles of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>As the&s;e ideas of the education of children are contrary to rea&s;on, they are equally contrary to &s;cripture. That commands us to <Q>train up a child in the way he &s;hould go,</Q> with encourage|ment that <Q>when he is old, he &s;hall not depart from it,</Q> and to <Q>bring up our children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</Q></P>
<P>Some allow indeed, that children are to be taught that the &s;criptures are the word of God; but are not to be taught the particular doctrines contained in the &s;criptures; that as to the mean|ing and contents of the &s;criptures, they are to judge entirely for them&s;elves. But why are they not to be taught, as well that the &s;criptures con|tain &s;uch and &s;uch particular doctrines, as that the &s;criptures them&s;elves are the word of God? They have the &s;ame right of private judgment in the one of the&s;e ca&s;es as the other. To teach our chil|dren, that the &s;criptures are the word of God, and not to teach them any of the particular doctrines of &s;cripture, is like carefully teaching them that a certain volume contains the laws of our country; but at the &s;ame time cautiou&s;ly avoiding to teach them any of the laws which are contained in that volume: or teaching them, that hu&s;bandry is the be&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s of life; yet not teaching them any thing in particular concerning hu&s;bandry.</P>

<P N="1">1. To the pa&s;tor elect&mdash;</P>
<P>MY DEAR SIR,</P>
<P>I have endeavored to repre&s;ent the importance and nece&s;&s;ity of preaching the truth; and have done it with a &s;pecial reference to you. We who are in the mini&s;try are always liable to temptation, as in other re&s;pects, &s;o in faithfully preaching the truth. And the very circum&s;tance, which in it&s;elf is &s;o agreeable, that there is &s;o great and cordial an unanimity among this people, with re&s;pect to your &s;ettlement among them, may increa&s;e your temp|tation. It may make you more remi&s;s in your &s;tu|dies and more negligent in faithfully declaring the truth. It may put you off your guard, and thus you may expo&s;e your&s;elf and expo&s;e the cau&s;e of
<PB N="24" REF="028618_0023_0FD9C7208431DE28">
truth. It may be an occa&s;ion of a pre&s;umptuous conduct or mode of preaching; or on the other hand, it may be the occa&s;ion of making you ex|ce&s;&s;ively compliant, &s;o as to &s;uppre&s;s important and u&s;eful truth, in order to pre&s;erve the pre&s;ent peace and unanimity. I be&s;eech you to avoid all the&s;e, <Q>to hold fa&s;t the form of &s;ound words once delivered to the &s;aints,</Q> and not to be &s;educed from them by any temptation. Yet preach the truth prudently and with circum&s;pection. All things that are lawful, are not expedient. Beware of preaching &s;o as to be mi&s;under&s;tood by the u&s;e of terms, to which your people have affixed ideas different from your own. Dwell not perpetually on a few favorite topics. All evangelical truth is divine; all is u&s;eful.</P>
<P>That you may thus preach, read exten&s;ively. "Beware of the man who reads but one book," is an old and &s;en&s;ible ob&s;ervation. By reading ex|ten&s;ively you will &s;ee not only what truth others have taught, but what errors they have taught, and the rea&s;ons with which they have endeavored to &s;up|port tho&s;e errors. Thus you will know how the better to guard again&s;t tho&s;e errors, and to illu&s;|trate the contrary truth.</P>
<P>You are to teach the truth not only in the pul|pit, but day by day in your walk and conver&s;ation. Thus not only you will &s;how, that you believe what you preach, but you will add force to it.</P>
<P>You, as well as mini&s;ters in general, will have great need of prudence in all your conduct, and of keeping the entire ma&s;try of your&s;elf. <Q>He that ruleth his &s;pirit, is greater than he that taketh a

city.</Q> In ca&s;es of oppo&s;ition (and you may have oppo&s;ition, notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ent happy ap|pearance) the greate&s;t danger is from our&s;elves. If we do not keep under our pa&s;&s;ions and feelings, our enemies will not fail to take the advantage of us. This therefore, in ca&s;e of oppo&s;ition, you are to expect; and the con&s;equence may be fatal to your comfort and u&s;efulne&s;s in this place, and det|rimental to the cau&s;e of truth in general. But if agreeably to our Lord's direction, you be wi&s;e as a &s;erpent and harmle&s;s as a dove; if you preach the truth faithfully and feel and live accordingly, you may hope for a ble&s;&s;ing on your mini&s;try. But however this may be, you will be accepted and approved by the great &s;hepherd of the &s;heep, who will &s;ay to you at la&s;t, <Q>Well done, thou good and faithful &s;ervant; thou ha&s;t been faithful over a few things; be thou ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. I am to addre&s;s my&s;elf in a very few words to this church and &s;ociety.</P>
<P>MEN and BRETHREN,</P>
<P>You have heard what has been &s;aid to your pa&s;|tor elect and the exhortation to him, to preach the truth. If he be bound to preach the truth, you are bound to hear, receive and obey it. If he &s;hall faithfully preach it, he will be accepted by his God and Judge, whether you hear or forbear. You are now to have another pa&s;tor &s;et over you in the Lord. This is one of the gifts which Chri&s;t has received and which he di&s;pen&s;es in con&s;equence of his a&s;cen&s;ion: and you are accountable for the
<PB N="26" REF="028618_0025_0FD9C72744FB8B10">
manner in which you &s;hall improve by this gift. Your pa&s;tor is to be a watchman on this part of the walls of Jeru&s;alem, to give warning to you. If he &s;hall faithfully warn you and you &s;hall not hear nor regard, your blood will be on your own heads. But if you &s;hall hear and comply, you &s;hall live. Therefore take heed how you hear. <Q>Incline your ear and come unto Chri&s;t. Hear and your &s;ouls &s;hall live; and he will make with you an everla&s;ting covenant, even the &s;ure mercies of David.</Q></P>

<P>OUR Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, having &s;uffered on the cro&s;s, and thereby purcha&s;ed the church with his own blood: before his a&s;cen&s;ion into Heaven, gave gifts to men, as apo&s;tles, and proph|ets, and evangeli&s;ts, and pa&s;tors, and teachers: for the perfecting of the &s;aints, for the work of the mini&s;try and edification of the church.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tles who were the fir&s;t mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, were called, commi&s;&s;ioned, and furni&s;hed, for the work to which they were called, in an ex|traordinary and &s;upernatural way: and in this their extraordinary character of apo&s;tles, they left no &s;ucce&s;&s;ors: for &s;ince the gift of in&s;piration, and the power of miracles have cea&s;ed; the only or|der of public teachers in the chri&s;tian church, is that of pa&s;tors, elders, or bi&s;hops; appellations, names and titles, evidently &s;ynonimous, and in the new te&s;tament, given indifferently to officers of the &s;ame order and rank in Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible kingdom.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e officers is, to over&s;ee, and feed the church of God; giving them&s;elves con|tinually to prayer, and to the mini&s;try of the word: and according to our Saviour's promi&s;e they will continue, in a regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to the end of time.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="028618_0027_0FD9C68C055497F0">The work to which mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel are called, is of great, very great importance.

<P>In the bible you will find the duty of a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter, clearly pointed out: therefore, thou man of God! acquaint thy&s;elf more and more, with the&s;e lively oracles; give attendance to reading; &s;earch the &s;criptures daily; &s;tudy the duties of your office; and give your&s;elf to prayer for an under|&s;tanding heart, that you may know what the mind of the &s;pirit is, and what the Lord would have you do: meditate upon the&s;e things; give thy&s;elf whol|ly to them, that thy profiting may appear unto all.</P>
<P>He that de&s;ireth the office of a Bi&s;hop, de&s;ireth a good work: But a Bi&s;hop mu&s;t be blamele&s;s as the &s;teward of God; not &s;elf-willed; not &s;oon an|gry; not given to wine; no &s;triker; not given to filthy lucre; not contentious, not covetous; but given to ho&s;pitality; a lover of good men; patient, &s;ober, ju&s;t, holy, temperate, vigilant, of good be|haviour in all re&s;pects, and of good report among all men: apt to teach; and able by &s;ound doctrine, both to exhort, and to convince gain&s;ayers.</P>
<P>Take heed therefore unto thy&s;elf&mdash;to thy life and conver&s;ation. Flee every fooli&s;h and hurtful lu&s;t, and avoid profane and fooli&s;h talking, and
<PB N="31" REF="028618_0030_0FD9C73434915DF0">
&s;uch je&s;ting as is not convenient; yea, carefully &s;hun every thing which may reflect blame on the mini&s;try, or give occa&s;ion for any to de&s;pi&s;e thee. Show thy&s;elf a pattern of good works; and let your conver&s;ation at all times be as becom|eth the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. Follow righteou&s;ne&s;s, godline&s;s, faith, love, patience and meekne&s;s; let your light &s;hine before men, that they may &s;ee your good works; con&s;tantly practice what&s;o|ever things are true, what&s;oever things are hone&s;t, what&s;oever things are pure, what&s;oever things are lovely, what&s;oever things are of good report, and what&s;oever is virtuous, and worthy prai&s;e. Keep your body under, and bring it into &s;ubjection, le&s;t by any means, when you have preached to others, you your&s;elf, &s;hould be ca&s;t away.</P>
<P>Take heed al&s;o unto thy doctrine, and in your preaching &s;how uncorruptne&s;s, gravity, &s;incerity and &s;ound &s;peech which cannot be condemned. Renounce the hidden things of di&s;hone&s;ty; walk not in craftine&s;s, nor handle the word of God de|ceitfully, but by manife&s;tation of the truth, com|mend your&s;elf to every man's con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God. Take heed what you preach. Be not a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, but preach the peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing doctrines of chri&s;tian|ity&mdash;preach the un&s;earchable riches of a crucified and ri&s;en Saviour&mdash;preach the divinity, the huma|nity, and the atonement of Chri&s;t, and point &s;in|ners to him, as the Lamb of God, which taketh away the &s;ins of the world. Preach al&s;o the apo&s;ta|cy of the human race, and wickedne&s;s of the human heart&mdash;the nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration, and &s;overeign|ty of divine grace: Shun not to delcare the whole coun&s;el of God: but preach the truth, the whole
<PB N="32" REF="028618_0031_0FD9C738E63A02C0">
truth and nothing but the truth. A di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel is committed unto thee; and wo unto thee, EDWARD DORR, if thou preach not the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Furthermore, take heed how you preach; and &s;how your&s;elf a workman, who needeth not to be a&s;hamed, rightly dividing the word of truth, and choo&s;ing out the mo&s;t acceptable words in which to convey truth, to the hearts and con&s;cien|ces of your hearers. Be wi&s;e to win &s;ouls, and e&s;pou&s;e them to Chri&s;t. Preach like a dying man, to dying men. Be fervent in &s;pirit&mdash;the cau&s;e is good, be zealous in it; and both by the terrors of the Lord, and the extreme &s;ufferings of an incarnate God, be&s;eech &s;inners to become re|conciled to God. Point out to them their dan|ger, and open to them the way of &s;afety, and urge them to e&s;cape for their lives. Be in&s;tant, in &s;ea|&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on: reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-&s;uffering and doctrine: teaching pub|licly and from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, repentance towards God and faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble minded; and be gentle unto all men; in meek|ne&s;s in&s;tructing tho&s;e that oppo&s;e them&s;elves. Let your preaching be, not with enticing words of man's wi&s;dom, as if you &s;pake in an unknown tongue; but in a plain, familiar &s;tile, ea&s;y to be under&s;tood; that &s;o the ignorant and unlearned, may be in&s;tructed and edified: and cea&s;e not to warn every one night and day with tears, warn the wicked of their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions and &s;ins, warn them to flee from wrath to come. By thus taking heed unto thy&s;elf, and to thy doctrine, and con|tinuing in them, thou &s;halt both &s;ave thy&s;elf, and them that hear thee.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="028618_0032_0FD9C73B9DA4F188">Again, pray with and for this people:&mdash;bear them on your heart continually; and, without cea&s;ing, make mention of them always in your prayers. You will al&s;o from time to time, ble&s;s this people in the name of the Lord. And that you may know their &s;tate, and be able to adapt your labors to their particular circum&s;tances, it will be nece&s;&s;ary for you to vi&s;it them, as you have opportunity, as well in health as in &s;ickne&s;s, and both in pro&s;perity and in adver&s;ity; and, as pru|dence &s;hall direct, conver&s;e with them about their temporal, and about their &s;piritual concerns.</P>
<P>Moreover, we charge thee to admini&s;ter the &s;eals of the new Te&s;tament, Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper; but to &s;uch, and to none but &s;uch, as are duly qualified, according to the laws of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible kingdom. Attentively ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever he hath commanded; and neither add to, nor dimini&s;h from his written word; but taking that for your guide, carefully di&s;tingui&s;h between the unclean, and the clean; and put a difference between the holy and profane. Beware you do not give that which is holy unto dogs; neither offend the generation of God's children, for whom Chri&s;t died.</P>
<P>We charge thee al&s;o to exerci&s;e go&s;pel di&s;ci|pline, according to the authority Chri&s;t hath given his mini&s;ters, as officers in his kingdom; which authority is given them, not for the de&s;truction, but for the edification of the members of his body, the church. Therefore, reprove, rebuke, admon|i&s;h, and reject as occa&s;ion &s;hall require. But do nothing by partiality; and yet, of &s;ome have com|pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="34" REF="028618_0033_0FD9C73D085FA570">
making a difference; others &s;ave with fear, pulling them out of the fire.</P>
<P>Finally, The mini&s;terial office, which, in all its parts, is now committed to thee; the &s;ame do thou al&s;o commit to faithful men. And that you may not partake of other men's &s;ins, but keep thy|&s;elf pure; lay hands &s;uddenly on no man, nor be in&s;trumental of introducing any into the go&s;pel mini&s;try, but &s;uch as are of good report, &s;ound in the faith with re&s;pect to the e&s;&s;ential doctrines of chri&s;tianity, and in a judgment of charity real friends to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>We give thee charge, brother, as we our&s;elves have been charged, in the &s;ight of God, who quick|eneth all things, and before Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who in the pre&s;ence of Pontius Pilate witne&s;&s;ed a good confe&s;&s;ion&mdash;before God and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we charge thee, to keep that which is committed to thy tru&s;t. You are now a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, and &s;teward of the my&s;teries of God: and every motive which ought to influence a rational mind, allures, and con&s;trains you to be a good mini&s;ter and faithful &s;teward. They that be wi&s;e, &s;hall &s;hine as the brightne&s;s of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the &s;tars for ever and ever. And he which converteth a &s;inner from the error of his way, &s;hall &s;ave a &s;oul from death, and &s;hall hide a multitude of &s;ins. What encouraging pro&s;pects! What animating con&s;ide|rations, for the me&s;&s;engers of the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the amba&s;&s;adors for Chri&s;t! Be thou a faithful laborer in your Lord and ma&s;ter's vineyard; and when the chief &s;hepherd &s;hall appear, you &s;hall re|ceive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. To

<P><HI>And Dear SIR,</HI></P>
<P>We do now with plea&s;ure, and humble thank|fulne&s;s to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the great head of the church, welcome you as a labourer into his harve&s;t; bidding you God's &s;peed; wi&s;hing you grace to be faithful, mercy to be &s;ucce&s;sful, and that the peace of God may re&s;t upon you.&mdash;God having betru&s;ted you with the keys of doctrine and of di&s;cipline, and &s;ent you forth as a &s;hepherd, to guard, lead and feed his flock; inve&s;ting you with the &s;ame authority wherewith he hath cloathed us. Wherefore we do with freedom and willingne&s;s acknowledge and receive you as one of us; in confirmation of which, I give you my right hand, as a te&s;timony that we e&s;teem you a brother, and fellow labourer together with us in the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel, which we have received of the Lord.</P>
<P>And we being members of the &s;ame body, and having the &s;ame work to pro&s;ecute, &s;hould be ve|ry careful not to think more highly than we ought to think; but behave with meekne&s;s and fraternal affection one towards another, &s;o that faith may not be had with re&s;pect of per&s;ons.</P>
