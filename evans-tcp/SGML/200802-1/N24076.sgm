<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>II. CHRONICLES vii.1.</HI></BIBL>
<P>&mdash;Now when Solomon had made an end of pray|ing, the fire came down from Heaven, and con&s;umed the burnt offering and the &s;acrifice, and the glory of the Lord filled the Hou&s;e.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>UNDER the Mo&s;aic Di&s;pen&s;ation, of|ferings were made u&s;e of as a principal part of the public wor&s;hip of God by the Jewi&s;h Church: the&s;e were of two kinds, Gifts and Sacrifices, wherein the life of the creature offered was taken away. The de|&s;ign was to make an atonement for their &s;ins, to expre&s;s their gratitude to God for mercies received, and to procure new favors from his hand.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after the &s;ail the Lord in&s;truct|ed Adam to offer &s;acrifice, Gen. iii.21. When Abel was grown up, he offered the be&s;t of his flock in &s;acri|fice to God, Gen. iv.4, 10. When Noah went forth from the ark, he offered an acceptable &s;acrifice, Gen. viii.20. At different places and upon different occa|&s;ions, Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, offered &s;acrifices to
<PB N="4" REF="031840_0003_0FEECF471187FDC8">
the Lord by his command. From the&s;e injunctions to the Patriarchs, the cu&s;tom of offering &s;acrifice &s;pread through the world&mdash;the&s;e &s;acrifices, when offered in faith in reference to the Me&s;&s;iah, as the Lamb which was to be &s;lain to take away &s;in, were con&s;umed upon the altar by fire from Heaven, as a mark of divine approbation.</P>
<P>THEY were di&s;tingui&s;hed by various appellati|ons: &s;uch as Burnt-offerings, Peace offerings, Sin-of|ferings, Tre&s;pa&s;s offerings, Meat-offerings, and Drink-offerings, together with various other kinds.</P>
<P>THE Offerings made u&s;e of by Solomon at the dedication of the Temple, were Burnt offerings and Peace-offerings: upon which occa&s;ion he offered twenty-two thou&s;and Oxen, and an hundred and twen|ty thou&s;and Sheep. When the bea&s;ts to be offered were prepared and laid upon the Altar, and when the Congregation and Elders of I&s;rael were a&s;&s;embled, to|gether with the Prie&s;ts, the Levites, the Singers and play|ers upon in&s;truments, the Lord gave them a token of his pre&s;ence, and that he meant to favor their de&s;ign and ble&s;s the Congregation, by filling the hou&s;e with a thick cloud. Solomon laid hold on the opportunity, and with the mo&s;t profound reverence and &s;olemnity, dedicated the hou&s;e by prayer and &s;upplication, invi|ting the Almighty to make it the temple of his abode; the &s;ub&s;tance of which prayer we have in the 6th Chap|ter
<PB N="5" REF="031840_0004_0FEECF4896339FD0">
of this Book. The Hi&s;torian informs us that when Solomon had made an end of praying (as a mark of divine approbation) fire came down from Heaven and con&s;umed the Burnt-offering and the Sacrifices, and that the glory of the Lord filled the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>DID not this &s;trikingly repre&s;ent the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who offered him&s;elf a &s;acrifice for &s;in, who alone builds the Spiritual Temple, the Church; who takes poor &s;inners out of the ruins of fallen nature, forms them by his word and &s;pirit, and makes them lively &s;tones in the Spiritual building, to offer &s;piritual Sacri|fice, acceptable to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who con&s;e|crates the Church by his matchle&s;s offering and all pre|valent interce&s;&s;ion; and who, by the fire of his love, fills the hearts of his people with his glory, and con|&s;umes the power of their &s;ins and corruptions. It al&s;o reminds us of the obligations we are under to dedicate this Hou&s;e, which has been erected under the care of a kind and indulgent Providence to the Lord, for his wor&s;hip and &s;ervice. I &s;hall therefore,</P>
<P N="1">I. CONSIDER the qualifications nece&s;&s;ary for dedicating a Hou&s;e to the Lord, with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">II. SHEW in what manner we &s;hould proceed in dedicating this Hou&s;e to the Lord, or what kind of &s;acrifices we &s;hould offer which will be acceptable.</P>
<P N="3">III. POINT out the tokens of our &s;acrifices being
<PB N="6" REF="031840_0005_0FEECF4A1BC9EFF8">
acceptable to God.
<Q>The fire came down from Hea|ven and con&s;umed the Burnt-offering and the &s;acri|fices: and the glory of the Lord filled the Hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t things which now demand our attention are the qualifications nece&s;&s;ary for dedicating a Hou&s;e to the Lord with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>TO avoid the charge of hypocri&s;y brought a|gain&s;t I&s;rael&mdash;
<Q>This People draweth nigh to me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me,</Q>
we &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly enquire whether we have made a cheerful dedication of our|&s;elves to the Lord. In vain do we engage in the &s;o|lemnities of this day unle&s;s our hearts have been cir|cumci&s;ed to love the Lord our God with all our hearts, Deut. xxx.6.</P>
<P>UNLESS we have been humbled for our mani|fold &s;ins, and been divinely con&s;trained to &s;eek refuge in the atoning blood of ju&s;tifying righteou&s;ne&s;s of the great Redeemer of Mankind, who offered him&s;elf a &s;acrifice for &s;in; unle&s;s we have received him as our Prophet, Prie&s;t and King, by faith, with thank&s;giving, and given our&s;elves up to him, to be ruled by his laws, led by his Spirit, and to yield obedience to his com|mands; unle&s;s he has been made to us wi&s;dom, righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and redemption, how can we &s;et this Hou&s;e apart for his wor&s;hip with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s unle&s;s we are made &s;piritual, and wor&s;hip him
<PB N="7" REF="031840_0006_0FEECF4B9F9DFA98">
in &s;pirit and in truth; "<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">r," &s;ays an in&s;pired writer,
<Q>We are the circumci&s;ion who wor&s;hip God in the &s;pirit, rejoice in Chri&s;t Je&s;us and have no confidence in the fle&s;h.</Q>
Phil. iii.3.</P>
<P>THIS act of dedicating our&s;elves mu&s;t always precede every outward form of wor&s;hip &s;imilar to this, agreeable to the language of the Prophet, I&s;aiah xliv. 5.
<Q>One &s;hall &s;ay, I am the Lords: and another &s;hall call him&s;elf by the name of Jacob: and another &s;hall &s;ub&s;cribe with his hand unto the Lord, and &s;ir|name him&s;elf by the name of I&s;rael.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> WE &s;hould be well acquainted with the nature of that wor&s;hip which the Lord requires to be performed in his Hou&s;e, and only which can be accep|table to him&mdash;not the dry &s;y&s;tematical form of words, however beautifully arranged, and plea&s;ing to the ear, can afford him entertainment, nor be con&s;idered a &s;uf|ficient &s;ub&s;titute for the &s;incere devotion of the heart. In vain did the proud boa&s;ting Phari&s;ee enter the Temple with uplifted eyes and hands: in vain did he in a lofty tone addre&s;s the Almighty, &s;aying,
<Q>God, I thank thee I am not as other men are, extortioners, unju&s;t, adulterers, or even as this Publican. I fa&s;t twice in the week, I give tythes of all that I po&s;&s;e&s;s. While the Publican &s;tanding afar off, would not lift up &s;o much as his eyes unto Heaven, but &s;mote upon his brea&s;t, &s;aying, God be merciful to me, a &s;inner. This man went down to his hou&s;e ju&s;tified;</Q>
that is,
<PB N="8" REF="031840_0007_0FEECF548BDE3540">
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed peace of con&s;cience, which was to him an evidence that his &s;ins were pardoned, and his prayer was accepted.&mdash;As no goodne&s;s or moral virtues of ours will merit the favor of the Almighty, &s;o neither will any &s;in or multitude of offences exclude a peni|tent &s;inner the benefit of his mercy. The great Pa|rent of Mankind and object of religious wor&s;hip, re|quires the engagements of our hearts when we ap|proach him&mdash;"My Son, &s;ays he, give me thy heart."&mdash; When David was in&s;tructed to &s;eek the Lord, he repli|ed, "My heart &s;aid, Lord, thy face will I &s;eek." P&s;alm xxvii.8.
<Q>It is with the heart man believeth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s, then with the mouth confe&s;&s;ion will be made unto &s;alvation.</Q>
Rom. x.10. Every branch of our wor&s;hip mu&s;t corre&s;pond with the in&s;tructions of God's word, both as to doctrine and experience. If the&s;e will not bear examination by this infallible rule,
<Q>We do err, not knowing the &s;criptures, nor the pow|er of God.</Q>
Mat. xxii.29.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> A PROPER attention &s;hould be paid to the object we have in view, and the motives by which we are influenced in the act of dedicating this Hou&s;e to the Lord. What is the object? Is it popular ap|plau&s;e? Is it a mere conformity to the cu&s;tom of the day in which we live? Is it to gratify a &s;pirit of ambi|tion, and to become re&s;pectable as parti&s;ans of a &s;epa|rate and di&s;tinct Society? In &s;hort, whatever it is, if it is not the glory of the divine Three, Father, Son and
<PB N="9" REF="031840_0008_0FEECF56109F37F0">
Holy Gho&s;t, in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel, the con|ver&s;ion of &s;inners, and the con&s;olation and edification of the People of God, yea, all that is comprehended in the word &s;alvation, we cannot expect it will pro&s;per, but come to nought, and in that ca&s;e, the &s;ooner the better.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd thing to be con&s;idered is the man|ner in which we &s;hould proceed in dedicating a Hou&s;e to the Lord, or what kind of &s;acrifices we &s;hould offer, which will be acceptable. Since it is not by the blood of Bulls and of Goats, and the a&s;hes of an Heifer, not by offering thou&s;ands of Rams, and ten thou&s;ands of rivers of oil, nor by our prayers, our tears, or mere ex|ternal acts of devotion, that &s;in can be removed from the heart, or the guilt of it from the con&s;cience, but by the blood of Chri&s;t our Pa&s;&s;over, who was &s;acrificed for us.
<Q>Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</Q>
Let us follow him in his victories and triumphs, and gather up the &s;poils.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> WE &s;hould attend to his wor&s;hip with rev|rence&mdash;reverence becomes the &s;anctuary, becomes ev|ery wor&s;hiper and is due to the object of wor&s;hip: for,
<Q>the Lord is greatly to be feared in the a&s;&s;embly of his &s;aints, and to be had in reverence by tho&s;e who draw nigh unto him. We are to &s;erve him with fear, and rejoice with trembling: for he is glorious in ho|line&s;s, fearful in prai&s;es, doing wonders.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="031840_0009_0FEECF5794896E58"><HI>Secondly.</HI> WE &s;hould come bowing at the foot|&s;tool of his mercy, as poor, having nothing but &s;in, and guilty, de&s;erving nothing but mi&s;ery: con&s;cious that we have no might to free our &s;ouls from the bondage of the law, or break the chains of unbelief; dependant wholly on the riches of mercy and grace, through Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, we &s;hould cry, "Lord, &s;ave, or we peri&s;h." This is an acceptable &s;acrifice, for the &s;acrifices of God are a broken &s;pirit, a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not de&s;pi&s;e. P&s;. li.17.
<Q>To this man he will look, and with &s;uch he will dwell, to revive the &s;pirit of the humble, and to revive the hearts of the contrite ones.</Q>
I&s;a. lvii.15. The&s;e are the ble&s;&s;ed de&s;cribed in Matt. v.3, 4, 6, and to them the promi&s;es belong.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> As a humble frame of mind is the mark of a true penitent, &s;o by prayer and &s;upplication, we &s;hould make known our reque&s;ts to God, re&s;ting upon the promi&s;e of &s;alvation, and wre&s;tling, as Jacob did with the Angel, when he &s;aid, I will not let thee go, except thou ble&s;s me; &s;uch will a&s;&s;uredly prevail and get that new name, the name of I&s;rael. Gen. xxxii.28. We &s;hould pray for the light of his countenance, and teachings of his &s;pirit, that his grand purpo&s;es and de&s;igns in the covenant of grace may be more unfold|ed, the my&s;tery of redeeming love explained, and that the un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t may be brought to view, that thou&s;ands may be effectually called to the
<PB N="11" REF="031840_0010_0FEECF59184AD388">
knowledge and enjoyment of the truth within the&s;e walls&mdash;we &s;hould pray that he might abundantly ble&s;s the provi&s;ion of his Hou&s;e, and &s;atisfy Zions poor with bread: that he might clothe his Prie&s;ts with &s;al|vation, and cau&s;e his &s;aints to &s;hout aloud for joy: that he might teach his Mini&s;ters hands to war and their fin|gers to fight again&s;t &s;in and error; that he might pour out his holy &s;pirit upon all his people, and dwell in this &s;anctuary, and in the heart of every wor&s;hipper: that he might cau&s;e his goodne&s;s to pa&s;s before us, and fill the Hou&s;e with his glory. We &s;hould pray for our en|emies, per&s;ecutors and &s;landerers, that their hearts may be changed, and they &s;aved in the Lord, with an ever|la&s;ting &s;alvation.</P>
<P>THIS is another acceptable &s;acrifice to him who hath &s;aid, "In all places where I record my name, I will come unto thee, and I will ble&s;s thee." Exodus xx.24.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Gratitude of heart, and a public ac|knowledgement of his goodne&s;s and mercy, is another &s;acrifice acceptable to the Lord. As a warning to us, and to mark the ingratitude of Hezekiah, who had re|ceived &s;o many and &s;uch great favors at the Lord's hand, it is recorded, 2 Chron. xxxii.25.
<Q>But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done un|to him;</Q>
When the ten Lepers were clean&s;ed by our Lord, and only one turned back to glorify God, he noticed their ingratitude by &s;aying.
<Q>Were there not
<PB N="12" REF="031840_0011_0FEECF61B3E71818">
ten clean&s;ed, but where are the nine?</Q>
Luke xvii.17. In addition to the innumerable benefits we have received from the Lord, both temporal and &s;piritual, we &s;hould not be unmindful of the&s;e: that our eyes have &s;een his &s;alvation; that our ears have heard and con|tinue to hear the joyful &s;ound of the Go&s;pel; that our feet have been directed into the paths of righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o that we can feed upon the word of truth, and that now, under the direction of his kind Providence, this Hou&s;e has been rai&s;ed, without any material injury to any concerned therein, and under the &s;anction of good and whole&s;ome laws we are formed into a &s;ociety, and regularly incorporated, &s;o that we can &s;it under our own vine and fig-tree, and wor&s;hip God agreeable to the dictates of our con&s;ciences. Our &s;acrifices &s;hould continually be offered upon that altar which &s;anctifieth the gift and the giver, even Je&s;us, who is our &s;acrifice, our Prie&s;t, and through whom only we can approach the Father. His invitation and promi&s;e are the foun|dation for our confidence, that what&s;oever we a&s;k we &s;hall receive&mdash;his honor is engaged to make good the promi&s;es, and his prai&s;e is promoted by our reliance thereon; &s;o that his glory is in&s;eparably connected with the &s;alvation of tho&s;e who believe.</P>
<P>THIRDLY I &s;hall point out the tokens of our &s;a|crifices being acceptable to the Lord.
<Q>The fire came down from Heaven and con&s;umed the burnt-offer|ing and the &s;acrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the Hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="031840_0012_0FEECF635E953170"><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> IN the days of old the Lord manife&s;ted his approbation in con&s;uming the &s;acrifice by fire from Heaven. When, by divine appointment Mo&s;es had a|nointed Aaron and his &s;ons to the office of the Prie&s;t|hood, and Aaron had brought his &s;in-offering, burnt-offering and peace-offering to the altar, fire came down from Heaven and con&s;umed the &s;acrifices, Lev&middot; ix.24. as a token of his divine approbation. When the I&s;raelites were defeated in battle by the Midianites, Gideon prayed, and offered a Kid and unleavened bread: in an&s;wer to his prayer and to honor the gift he has offered, fire ro&s;e up out of the rock, and con&s;u|med the fle&s;h, and the unleavened bread, and I&s;rael prevailed again&s;t Midian. Judges vi.21. When Da|vid had di&s;plea&s;ed the Lord by numbering the people, &s;eventy thou&s;and I&s;raelites were &s;lain by pe&s;tilence; he then built an altar and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon the Lord, and he an&s;wered him from Heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offerings. 1 Chron. 21, 26. To reprove the Idoli|trous wor&s;hippers of Baal, and to expo&s;e the fal&s;e pro|phets who had deluded them, Elijah built an altar, and offered a burnt-&s;acrifice, while the fal&s;e prophets cried in vain to their Idol, the fire came down and con&s;umed Elijahs &s;acrifice, and the wood, and the &s;tones, and the du&s;t, and licked up the water that was in the trench. 1 Kings xviii.38. No &s;ooner had Solomon made an end of praying before the whole congregation of I&s;rael, at
<PB N="14" REF="031840_0013_0FEECF64E51C1770">
the dedication of the Temple, but fire came down from Heaven and con&s;umed the burnt-offering and the &s;acri|fices, as a token of divine approbation.</P>
<P>THE con&s;uming the&s;e offerings, was typical of the attention the Lord pays to the prayers of his peo|ple, and the honor he confers upon tho&s;e who put their tru&s;t in him; he hearkens to the voice of their &s;uppli|cations, he hears their cry, and &s;aves them out of all their troubles:&mdash;There is al&s;o a book of remembrance before him, which contains every reque&s;t, however imperfectly made, if they are the reque&s;ts of the &s;oul, and which, in his own time, and in his own way, will fully be an&s;wered. Mal. iii.16. The greate&s;t de&s;ires of a &s;oul under the teachings of the &s;pirit, are to have the mind pre&s;erved from guilt, and the heart from the power and pollution of &s;in, that they may continually be enabled to &s;ay,
<Q>Whom have we in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon earth that we de&s;ire be|&s;ides thee.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN the my&s;teries of Redeeming Love, mani|fe&s;ted in the covenant of grace, in the un&s;peakable gift of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and in our effectual calling by the &s;pi|rit, who&s;e favors are without repentance, when the&s;e, I &s;ay, are explained and accompanied with an almighty and irre&s;i&s;tible power to the &s;oul, fear and &s;orrow vani&s;h, joy and peace &s;ucceed, and the holy fire of di|vine love warms the heart with inexpre&s;&s;ible delight, and con&s;umes the power of our bea&s;tly lu&s;ts and cor|ruptions.
<PB N="15" REF="031840_0014_0FEECF6669C5D518">
When Je&s;us opened the under&s;tandings of the two di&s;ciples, in their journey from Jeru&s;alem to Emmaus, they were con&s;trained to acknowledge that their hearts burned within them. Luke xxiv.32.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> When Mo&s;es was upon the Mount talking with God, he &s;aid, "&s;hew me thy glory!" The Lord an&s;wered him,
<Q>Thou can&s;t not &s;ee my face, for no man can &s;ee my face and live, but I will make all my goodne&s;s pa&s;s before thee, and he proclaimed the name of the Lord, the Lord merciful and gracious, long-&s;uffering, and abundant in goodne&s;s and truth.</Q>
Exod. xxxiii.18, 20. xxxiv.6. The glory of God which filled the Temple when Solomon had made an end of praying was the cloud and a vi&s;ible brightne&s;s, like that of the Sun when covered with a thick cloud, though it cannot be &s;een in its &s;plendor and glory, yet its brightne&s;s will be vi&s;ible in a certain degree, and the beholder will be &s;atisfied that it is not removed, but veiled by the cloud, and that only for a &s;hort period, when its power and influence will return. Incomparably more ea&s;y would it be to behold the Sun, with the naked eye, in his brightne&s;s and glory, without an interpo&s;ing veil, than in our mortal and imperfect &s;tate, to &s;ee the Almighty face to face. He is to be &s;een and known only through the veil of Chri&s;t's human nature,
<Q>For God is in Chri&s;t reconciling the world unto him&s;elf. In Chri&s;t dwells all the fulne&s;s of the godhead bodily,</Q>
and he is the
<Q>brightne&s;s of the Father's glory, and the
<PB N="16" REF="031840_0015_0FEECF6E8A27F5D8">
expre&s;s image of his per&s;on.</Q>
The glory which filled the Temple, produced a reverential awe of God's holi|ne&s;s, wi&s;dom, power, love and faithfulne&s;s, and influen|ced them to wor&s;hip him with &s;uitable affections.</P>
<P>THEY were &s;en&s;ible he was pre&s;ent, though they could not &s;ee him with their bodily eyes. So now in the act of religious wor&s;hip, the token we &s;hould look for, and are encouraged to expect, of the pre&s;ence and approbation of the Lord, is that glory which will fill the Hou&s;e and the heart of every &s;piritual wor&s;hiper; if we have &s;uch views of his holine&s;s as to &s;ay with Job. chap. xlii.5, 6.
<Q>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye &s;eeth thee, wherefore, I abhor my&s;elf, and repent in du&s;t and a&s;hes.</Q>
Such views of his wi&s;dom in the whole oeconomy of redemption, as to admire and fall in with his method of &s;alvation; &s;uch views of his power as to fear offending him, and put our whole tru&s;t and confidence in him; &s;uch views of his love; as to feel our &s;ouls animated in his &s;ervice, and &s;uch views of his faithfulne&s;s, as to rejoice, with joy un&s;peakable, and full of glory. Then how precious will the go&s;pel be to us, we &s;hall bind it as chains of gold about our necks. We &s;hall then behold the beauty of their feet who bring glad tidings of &s;alvation; then how delightful to be engaged in preaching, and profita|ble in hearing of the un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t, that in &s;uch circum&s;tances we may &s;ay with the &s;inger in I&s;|rael

"Glorious things are &s;poken of thee, O city of God." As the fountain of light, his rays penetrate the mind which was &s;hut up in darkne&s;s&mdash;Though faint when it ri&s;es, it &s;hines brighter and brighter to the per|fect day; &s;o does the divine glory upon the &s;oul ble&s;&s;ed with its quickening, illuminating, cheering and fructi|fying influences; &s;o powerful that its glory is reflected in their profe&s;&s;ion and conduct; and when the veil of mortality and human imperfection is removed, they will &s;hine as the brightne&s;s of the firmament, and as the &s;tars forever and ever;&mdash;then they will &s;ee eye to eye and face to face, lo&s;t in wonder, love and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this di&s;cour&s;e with an inquiry, and a few ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>HAS this great change pa&s;&s;ed upon us? Have we been con&s;trained to dedicate our&s;elves to God? If not, we have cau&s;e to tremble, con&s;idering what we are this morning engaged in. As the Lord cannot be de|ceived, &s;o neither will he be mocked. May he who commanded light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, &s;hine forth, through the preaching the go&s;pel of his Son, in his glo|rious power, that tho&s;e who are dead in tre&s;spa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, may hear his voice and live; that tho&s;e who &s;it in darkne&s;s may &s;ee a great light; that the glory of our Immanual, as God Man Mediator, may influence them to a cheerful dedication of body, &s;oul and &s;pirit to the Lord; con&s;idering they are not their own, but are bought with the price of the Redeemer's blood. May

every Believer this morning renew the act of dedicat|ing him&s;elf to the Lord. Whenever we enter this &s;anc|tuary, may the fire of divine love come down and warm our hearts, and con&s;ume the power of all our corrup|tions; and may the glory of the Lord fill this hou&s;e in the power of the go&s;pel, and the &s;weet enjoyment of his pre&s;ence.</P>

<P>MAY the Elders, Deacons, Church members, and every &s;tated and occa&s;ional wor&s;hiper in this place&punc; u|nite in praying for the peace of our Zion, and in cele|brating the prai&s;es of God.
