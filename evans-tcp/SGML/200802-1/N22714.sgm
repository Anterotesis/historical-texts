<P>AND I SAY ALSO UNTO THEE, THAT THOU ART PETER, AND UPON THIS ROCK I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH: AND THE GATES OF HELL SHALL NOT PRE|VAIL AGAINST IT.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words, which were &s;poken by Je&s;us Chri&s;t to his di&s;ciples <HI>in private,</HI> contain a more full declaration of his divine character, than he &s;aw fit ever to make <HI>in public.</HI> In this conference, he acknowledged to his di&s;ciples, without re&s;erve, that <HI>he</HI> was the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah. But, at the &s;ame time, "he charged his di&s;ciples, that they &s;hould tell no man that he was Je&s;us the Chri&s;t."</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="030021_0004_0FE3C70D2EE01B58">THE occa&s;ion of the&s;e words was this: Chri&s;t had been inquiring of his di&s;ciples what opinion of <HI>him</HI> the public entertained. "Whom do men &s;ay, that I, the Son of man am? And they &s;aid, &s;ome &s;ay that thou art John the Bapti&s;t, &s;ome Elias, and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets." He then a&s;ked them <HI>their own</HI> opinion. "Whom &s;ay ye that I am? And Simon Peter an&s;wered and &s;aid, Thou art Chri&s;t, the Son of the living God. And Je&s;us an&s;wered and &s;aid unto him, Ble&s;&s;ed art thou, Simon Barjo|na: for fle&s;h and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven."</P>
<P>THIS reply of Chri&s;t was expre&s;&s;ive of his appro|bation of Peter's an&s;wer, and an implicit acknowl|edgment, that <HI>his</HI> opinion of his ma&s;ter was ju&s;t. And, on account of the faith, expre&s;&s;ed in his an&s;|wer, Chri&s;t pronounced him <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI>; and intimated, al&s;o, that <HI>that</HI> faith, which entitleth to happine&s;s, cometh not from man, but God. "Fle&s;h and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven. And I &s;ay al&s;o unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church: and the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it."</P>
<P>CHRIST was plea&s;ed, as Peter had made a good profe&s;&s;ion, frankly to declare him&s;elf to be the Me&s;|&s;iah, or the STONE, laid for the foundation of the church, which had been foretold by the prophets;
<PB N="7" REF="030021_0005_0FE3C711A30F3C28">
al&s;o, to declare the <HI>&s;tability</HI> of the church.</P>
<P>THIS pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture hath occa&s;ioned much controver&s;y among&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity. The Papi&s;ts have alledged, that, by <HI>this rock,</HI> on which Chri&s;t promi&s;ed to build his church, was meant <HI>Peter,</HI> the word <HI>Peter</HI> &s;ignifying a rock, or &s;tone. The Prote&s;tants, on the contrary, have maintained, that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf</HI> was intended by <HI>this rock.</HI> Some, however, have &s;uppo&s;ed, that they might grant, that, by <HI>this Rock,</HI> Chri&s;t meant <HI>Peter,</HI> and the <HI>other Apo&s;|tles,</HI> (in who&s;e name Peter an&s;wered) without help|ing, in the lea&s;t, the cau&s;e of the Papi&s;ts, who wi&s;h, by the aid of this text, to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;upremacy of the Pope, denominated, by them, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the Peter; ina&s;much, as Chri&s;t faith nothing about any <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;or</HI> of Peter, or of the other apo&s;tles; and as the apo&s;tles were, in a &s;en&s;e, the foundation of the church, as is intimated in Eph. ii. 20, "And are built upon the foundation of the apo&s;tles and pro|phets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf being the chief corner &s;tone." Al&s;o, Rev. xxi. 14. "And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apo&s;tles of the Lamb."</P>
<P>As the apo&s;tles were in&s;truments, which God employed, fir&s;t to propagate the go&s;pel, and &s;et up the chri&s;tian church, in the world, they were, in a &s;en&s;e, the foundation of the church. But, it doth not appear that <HI>Peter</HI> was a foundation, rather than
<PB N="8" REF="030021_0006_0FE3C7168A44B538">
the other apo&s;tles, nor, that any of them had &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in their office. The apo&s;tles were extraordinary officers, rai&s;ed up, in the beginning of the age of chri&s;tianity, to &s;pread the go&s;pel, and plant churches; and the office expired with tho&s;e, who were at fir&s;t honoured with it.</P>
<P>THAT Chri&s;t meant <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> and not <HI>Peter,</HI> it is al&s;o argued, from his varying the term, when he &s;aid <HI>On this rock,</HI> and not u&s;ing the very word <HI>Peter,</HI> though that al&s;o &s;ignified a rock. He might, al&s;o, point out him&s;elf, in &s;ome way, when he uttered the&s;e words, as he probably did at another time, when he &s;aid, "De&s;troy this temple, and within three days I will rear it again." Some, <HI>then,</HI> under&s;tood him to &s;peak of the temple, to which the Jews re&s;orted for wor&s;hip; "but he &s;poke of the temple of his body." So, in the pa&s;&s;age under con&s;ideration, without doubt, he meant <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> by <HI>this rock,</HI> alluding to that pro|phecy in I&s;ai. xxviii. 16. "Therefore thus &s;aith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a &s;tone, a tried &s;tone, a precious corner &s;tone, a &s;ure foundation." As Peter had profe&s;&s;ed to believe, that Je&s;us was <HI>the Chri&s;t, the Son of the living God,</HI> Chri&s;t proceeded, in addition to his profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;aid, "On this rock," On the &s;tone &s;poken of by I&s;aiah&mdash;on Chri&s;t, whom you acknowledge me to be, "I will build my church."</P>
<P>CHRIST, in many places of &s;cripture, is &s;tiled a
<PB N="9" REF="030021_0007_0FE3C719F2BA6F58">
<HI>rock</HI> or <HI>&s;tone,</HI> and is &s;aid to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> foundation of his church. 1 Cor. iii. 11. "For other founda|tion can no man lay, than that laid, which is Je&s;us Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>FURTHER, it may be remarked upon the words of Chri&s;t in our text, that this mode of expre&s;&s;ion, which he u&s;ed, <HI>I &s;ay al&s;o unto thee,</HI> denoteth the thing a&s;&s;erted to be true and infallible&mdash;that what he predicts will a&s;&s;uredly be accompli&s;hed. The thing a&s;&s;erted by Chri&s;t is, that he will build his church on a <HI>firm</HI> foundation; and, that the <HI>gates of hell</HI>&mdash;the powers of darkne&s;s&mdash;the church's adver&s;aries, &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it&mdash;&s;hall neither be able to de&s;troy it, nor, prevent its growth.</P>
<P>It is implied, in the&s;e words of Chri&s;t, that the powers of darkne&s;s will fight again&s;t the church; and affirmed, that they &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it. We may, then, be led by our text, in the en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e, to con&s;ider</P>
<P N="1">I. The oppo&s;ition which hath hath been made to the church, and</P>
<P N="2">II. The &s;afety of the church, notwith&s;tanding its adver&s;aries.</P>
<P N="1">I. LET us con&s;ider <HI>the oppo&s;ition,</HI> which hath been made unto the church.</P>
<P>By the church are meant believers, or the multi|tude of <HI>the faithful,</HI> in the whole world, whether
<PB N="10" REF="030021_0008_0FE3C71F9DD59E78">
Jews or Gentiles. Though this church, when com|pleted, will be a glorious body, Chri&s;t being its head, and the banner di&s;played over it, LOVE; yet it hath its enemies! It was early foretold, even when the fir&s;t intimations of the being of a church were given, that it would have a &s;ubtle, malignant foe. Gen. iii. 15. "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy feed and her &s;eed: it &s;hall brui&s;e thy head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his heel." Further on in the &s;acred &s;criptures, we learn, that, by <HI>the &s;eed of the woman,</HI> was meant <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as the head of his church; that &s;atan is the &s;erpent, and the adver&s;ary of Chri&s;t; and, that this ancient pre|diction intimated, that there would be war between &s;atan and the church, in which, Chri&s;t, or the church, would receive &s;ome wounds, <HI>not mortal,</HI> as they were in the <HI>heel</HI>; but that &s;atan would be brui&s;ed <HI>in the head</HI>&mdash;di&s;appointed and ruined. We have &s;ome account of this war, in Rev. xii. 7. "And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought again&s;t the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels." Michael is Chri&s;t; and by the dragon, as we are told in the following ver&s;e, was meant, "that old &s;erpent, called the devil and &s;atan, which deceiveth the whole world. "This &s;heweth, that the devil maketh great oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;t and his church. Chri&s;t had no &s;ooner begun to build up his church
<PB N="11" REF="030021_0009_0FE3C724DA349288">
(which he did &s;oon after the apo&s;tacy of Adam) than &s;atan began to oppo&s;e him, and to attempt to de&s;troy the church, or, prevent its growth. And that oppo|&s;ition hath been carried on, in all &s;ucceeding ages, even to the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>SOME of the ways, in which &s;atan hath fought again&s;t Chri&s;t, and endeavoured to prevent the growth of the church, are the following:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By tempting, and per&s;uading, mankind to reject the offers, made unto them in the go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>IN that pa&s;&s;age, ju&s;t now quoted from Revelation, it is &s;aid, that <HI>the devil deceiveth the whole world,</HI> that is, a great part of mankind. The apo&s;tle &s;aith, in 2 Cor. iv. 3&mdash;4, "If our go&s;pel be hid, it is hid to them that are lo&s;t: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, le&s;t the light of the glorious go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, who is the image of God, &s;hould &s;hine unto them," It hence appeareth, that &s;atan hath &s;uch influence upon many, as to prevent their receiving the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. Through the depravity of the human heart, men are ea&s;ily deceived by &s;atan, and prevailed upon to neglect the great &s;alvation, offered to all in the go&s;pel. Hence they are &s;aid to be "carried captive by him at his plea&s;ure." By the artifice of &s;atan, the go&s;pel, <HI>as yet,</HI> hath been heard, but by the &s;mall|er part of mankind. And a great part, there is rea|&s;on
<PB N="12" REF="030021_0010_0FE3C729C660B890">
to fear, of tho&s;e who hear it, are per&s;uaded by &s;atan to di&s;obey, de&s;pi&s;e and reject it, and refu&s;e to give their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in building Chri&s;t's church, by becoming believers.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>By prevailing upon &s;ome members of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible church to conduct in &s;uch a manner, as to bring a reproach upon religion.</HI></P>
<P>CHRIST hath &s;et up a <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> church in the world, as a "light in a dark place," to enlighten the world, to recommend true religion, and induce many to embrace it. But, &s;ometimes, members of the vi&s;ible church, by their &s;candalous conduct, like David, "give great occa&s;ion to the enemies of the Lord to bla&s;pheme," bring religion into contempt, and, there|by, prevent the growth of the church. Whereas, if profe&s;&s;ors of religion conducted with propriety, and walked as becometh their profe&s;&s;ion, "others, by &s;eeing their good works, might be led to glorify God."</P>
<P>Satan entered into <HI>Judas,</HI> and prevailed upon him to betray Chri&s;t; al&s;o, in tempting <HI>Peter</HI> to deny his Lord and Ma&s;ter, he proved &s;ucce&s;sful. And how many of the profe&s;&s;ed friends of Chri&s;t, &s;ince that time, have, <HI>by their works denied him,</HI> and be|trayed his cau&s;e!</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>By propagating &s;chi&s;ms, herefies, and pernicious doctrines.</HI></P>
<P>THERE were, in the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> church, even in the
<PB N="13" REF="030021_0011_0FE3C72DB75515B8">
apo&s;tolic age, fal&s;e doctrines, divi&s;ions and here&s;ies. One was for Paul, another for Cephas. Some con|tended earne&s;tly for the ob&s;ervance of the Mo&s;aic rites, denying, without this, the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation. Some held, "that the re&s;urrection was pa&s;t already, and thereby overthrew the faith of &s;ome." And, in all ages &s;ince, &s;atan hath prevailed upon &s;ome of the vi&s;ible church to &s;pread &s;entiments, which have a tendency to prevent the conver&s;ion of &s;inners, and to ob&s;truct the increa&s;e of Chri&s;t's church. Al&s;o, this malicious foe hath &s;ucceeded, in his attempts to &s;tir up &s;trife and divi&s;ions in the vi&s;ible church, and cau&s;e &s;chi&s;ms and &s;eparations among the profe&s;&s;ed followers of the Lamb of God. How many &s;ects, denominations, and parties, there are, in the Chri&s;tian church! Some appear to imbibe gro&s;s errors and delu&s;ions, implicitly "denying the Lord who bought them." And others &s;eparate from, and hate, their brethren <HI>only</HI> for differing from them in opinion, with re&s;pect to modes, and rites, and <HI>non-e&s;&s;entials</HI> of religion. Such &s;chi&s;ms and here&s;ies have a tenden|cy to increa&s;e &s;ceptics and infidels, and hinder the growth of the church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>By exciting per&s;ecution.</HI></P>
<P>WICKED men, in almo&s;t every age, being in&s;tiga|ted thereto by Chri&s;t's adver&s;ary, have cruelly per|&s;ecuted the church. The prophets, who predicted
<PB N="14" REF="030021_0012_0FE3C732A3973C90">
the coming of Chri&s;t, were put to death. And <HI>he,</HI> and his apo&s;tles, fared no better.</P>
<P>SOON after Chri&s;t's church, through the in&s;trumen|tality of the apo&s;tles, began to grow, <HI>the Jews</HI> &s;everely per&s;ecuted it. Many, who profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tianity, were put to death. Afterwards, it was mo&s;t violently per&s;ecuted, by the Roman Emperors, <HI>Nero, Domitian, Trajan, Severus, Diocle&s;ian,</HI> and &s;everal others. And &s;ome of the&s;e per&s;ecutions were carried on, with &s;uch fury, as to threaten the utter extirpation of the church. Thou&s;ands of thou&s;ands were put to death, and many of them, in a mo&s;t cruel manner, <HI>only</HI> for profe&s;&s;ing, and endeavouring to propagate, the chri&s;tian religion. Many, wrapt in combu&s;tible matter, fell victims to the devouring flames; &s;ome expired in agonies, like their innocent ma&s;ter, upon the cro&s;s; others were drawn to pieces by wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>AN edict was made, by the bloody Emperor <HI>Decius,</HI> about the middle of the third century, by which, the Praetors, upon pain of death, were obliged to extirpate the whole chri&s;tian &s;ect. What di&s;tre&s;s among chri&s;t|ians, what horror, what torrents of blood, were occa|&s;ioned by this!</P>
<P>AND, after the chri&s;tian religion had &s;o far prevailed, as to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Roman empire;&mdash;when the plea&s;ing hope of being per&s;ecuted no more, was excited in the brea&s;t of chri&s;tians, <HI>then,</HI> Satan, by his
<PB N="15" REF="030021_0013_0FE3C73820A5C1F0">
wiles, brought upon the church, per&s;ecution, from a quarter, not in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected. The <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> church, in con&s;equence of its e&s;tabli&s;hment&punc; as the national church, &s;oon became &s;o corrupt, as to com|mence <HI>a per&s;ecutor.</HI> Profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians per&s;ecuted, to the death, other profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians, becau&s;e <HI>they differed from them in &s;entiments!</HI></P>
<P>THE church of <HI>Rome,</HI> called the catholic church, had &s;werved &s;o far from the &s;implicity and purity of the go&s;pel, and introduced &s;o many flagrant corrup|tions, from the relicks of pagani&s;m; that many con&s;cientious chri&s;tians were obliged to renounce &s;ome of her gro&s;s errors and pernicious practices. The con&s;equence of which was, <HI>the reformers</HI> were per&s;ecuted, in the mo&s;t unchri&s;tian, inhuman man|ner, and driven from the church, and declared to be heretics.</P>
<P>AT length, they were protected by &s;ome temporal princes; and the reformed religion was e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;everal other places. But, a&s;toni&s;h|ing to relate! the church called <HI>the reformed,</HI> which had once &s;uffered per&s;ecution, became a per&s;ecutor <HI>her&s;elf.</HI> They refu&s;ed tho&s;e privileges to their breth|ren, which <HI>they</HI> had claimed, <HI>as the rights of man,</HI> for <HI>them&s;elves.</HI> Tho&s;e, who could not con&s;cientiou&s;ly conform to the e&s;tabli&s;hed modes of the church of England, were per&s;ecuted, as &s;everely, by <HI>that church,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="030021_0014_0FE3C73CAD9422F8">
as the reformers, before, had been, by <HI>the papi&s;ts.</HI> The &s;ame arguments, which <HI>they</HI> had formerly u&s;ed, to judge their departure from the e&s;tabli&s;hed corrup|tions of the church of Rome, were now offered to <HI>them,</HI> by their di&s;&s;enting brethren, with as much rea|&s;on, and with as <HI>little &s;ucce&s;s,</HI> to ju&s;tify their non-con|formity to what they deemed anti&s;criptural. The &s;ame pleas for liberty of con&s;cience, which <HI>they</HI> had once made, in their turn, they imprudently and un|chri&s;tianly rejected.</P>
<P>THIS per&s;ecution was the occa&s;ion of the &s;ettling of New-England. Tho&s;e, who were per&s;ecuted in their native country, came into the wilderne&s;s of America to enjoy liberty of con&s;cience, denied unto them at home, by their cruel and unrighteous brethren.</P>
<P>AND is it not a fact, that, wherever the chri&s;tian religion hath been e&s;tabli&s;hed as the national religion, none could enjoy liberty of con&s;cience, without &s;ome degree of per&s;ecution, except that particular &s;ect, or denomination, which happened to bear rule? Have not New-England and other parts of the United States been di&s;graced with per&s;ecution?</P>
<P>AND if, at any time, the civil government of any country, or nation, hath not allowed of men's &s;uffering in their e&s;tate, or limbs, or life, for their religion, (as is now the ca&s;e in the United States) Satan hath con|trived, and carried into execution, another &s;pecies of
<PB N="17" REF="030021_0015_0FE3C74166533BC8">
per&s;ecution, even <HI>&s;atire</HI> and <HI>banter,</HI> which, perhaps, is an improvement in the diabolical art, and better calculated to accompli&s;h the purpo&s;e of its author, and ob&s;truct the growth of Chri&s;t's church, than fire or &s;word, the wheel or gibbet, or any other in&s;tru|ment of cruelty.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>By exciting profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity to &s;ub&s;titute &s;uper&s;tition in the place of true and evangelical religion.</HI></P>
<P>THE children of I&s;rael, before Chri&s;t's day, as appeareth from the writings of the prophets, &s;ub&s;ti|tuted the ob&s;ervance of rites and &s;acrifices in the place of righteou&s;ne&s;s and mercy. The Phari&s;ees, a reli|gious &s;ect of Jews, in Chri&s;t's day, &s;trictly and con|&s;cientiou&s;ly tythed mint, anni&s;e and cummin, whil&s;t they neglected "the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith." And, how &s;oon, the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> church was corrupted, in this way! And to what an enormous height was &s;uper&s;tition carried, by the <HI>Catholic</HI> church! how many rites and ceremo|nies, and &s;ome of them the mo&s;t whim&s;ical that could be imagined, were enjoined, by <HI>that</HI> church, to be religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved!</P>
<P>THE natural con&s;equence of &s;uch &s;uper&s;tition, is, to cau&s;e men, when they become in a certain degree enlightened, to di&s;believe the divine origin of reveal|ed religion. They cannot readily di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween genuine chri&s;tianity, and its corruptions, blended with it, by the folly of men. Therefore,
<PB N="18" REF="030021_0016_0FE3C746ABFAC230">
when they &s;ee &s;o much &s;uper&s;tition and fal&s;e religion, mixed with chri&s;tianity, they di&s;card it all together; as many, at the pre&s;ent day, are doing in <HI>France,</HI> where &s;uper&s;tition hath, for a long time, &s;o greatly prevailed.</P>
<P>AND, without doubt, one rea&s;on of the increa&s;e of infidelity, in chri&s;tian countries, is the prevalence of &s;uper&s;tition among the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity. Let the chri&s;tian religion be &s;eparated from &s;uper&s;ti|tion, and be acted out, and taught, in its <HI>&s;implicity</HI> and <HI>purity,</HI> and it will recommend it&s;elf to every one, who is governed by rea&s;on. Then <HI>the age of rea&s;on,</HI> and <HI>the age of chri&s;tianity,</HI> will be &s;ynonymous.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;o long as profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity are zeal|ous and con&s;cientious about <HI>indifferent</HI> matters, and &s;lack in the performance of <HI>moral duties,</HI> the growth of Chri&s;t's church will be ob&s;tructed.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of the ways, in which &s;atan hath been oppo&s;ing, and fighting again&s;t, Chri&s;t and his church. But his oppo&s;ition is in vain. This leads to the next thing propo&s;ed:</P>
<P N="2">II. THE con&s;ideration of <HI>the &s;afety of the church,</HI> notwith&s;tanding its adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>"THE gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it." The church is &s;afe, notwith&s;tanding all the oppo&s;ition, made again&s;t it, by the powers of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>BY the church's being &s;afe, it is not meant, that every part of the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> church, or every <HI>individual
<PB N="19" REF="030021_0017_0FE3C74B91ACE700">
vi&s;ible</HI> church, &s;hall be pre&s;erved, and continue to the end of time. For many, which flouri&s;hed for a time, are now no more. Where are the churches, planted by the Apo&s;tles in A&s;ia;&mdash;tho&s;e, to which &s;ome of Paul's epi&s;tles were written, and to which john was ordered to write, Revelation? Their candle&s;tick hath been removed out of his place. That country, once ble&s;&s;ed with the re&s;idence of chri&s;tian churches, is now inhabited, principally, by Mahometans and Pagans.</P>
<P>THE JEWS, formerly the church of God, have been ca&s;t off by Chri&s;t, for their unbelief and irreligion. And, probably, this is the ca&s;e of &s;ome, who call them&s;elves <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> Chri&s;t threatened to &s;pue the church of <HI>Laodicea</HI> out of his mouth, except they &s;hould repent: al&s;o the church of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> were fore-warned of the removal of their candle&s;tick out of his place, unle&s;s they &s;hould reform. And, long &s;ince, tho&s;e threatenings have been executed.</P>
<P>NEITHER is it certain, that any one individual church, now on the earth, will endure to the end of the world. Mo&s;t probably there will not. All are corrupt, and will be taken down, or pa&s;s a great change, by reformation. Probably, among all the &s;ects, no one is entirely right. One hath one good qualification; and another, another: But all have their errors and imperfections, and mo&s;t probably will be removed.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="030021_0018_0FE3C75076569560">BUT by the &s;afety of the church, as the phra&s;e is u&s;ed in this di&s;cour&s;e, it is meant, that there &s;hall be a <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> church in the world, &s;o long as the world en|dures; al&s;o, that Chri&s;t's <HI>invi&s;ible,</HI> or real church &s;hall live forever.</P>
<P>THE &s;afety of Chri&s;t's church, in the&s;e re&s;pects, depends on its <HI>foundation.</HI> Chri&s;t is the foundation of the church. It re&s;ts on him&mdash;on him it is de|pendent for its &s;upport, as a building re&s;ts on its foundation. If Chri&s;t, then, is a <HI>good</HI> foundation, the building, erected on him, will &s;tand. And, in our text, Chri&s;t calleth him&s;elf a <HI>rock,</HI> which, is a firm foundation; and by the prophet, who foretold his coming, he is &s;tyled, "<HI>a precious corner-&s;tone, A SURE FOUNDATION.</HI>" The church, then, being built on &s;uch a foundation, is &s;table. And if the whole church be &s;afe, then the <HI>individuals,</HI> of which the church con|&s;i&s;teth, are &s;afe, and cannot be de&s;troyed: For if one individual, who was ever built on Chri&s;t, could fall from him, and peri&s;h, then why might not another, and the whole? How then is Chri&s;t <HI>a &s;ure foundation?</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;afety of each real chri&s;tian, and the impo&s;&s;i|bility of his peri&s;hing, are a&s;&s;erted by Chri&s;t, in Mat. vii. 24, 25. "Therefore, who&s;oever heareth the&s;e &s;ayings of mine, and doth them, I will liken him unto a wi&s;e man which built his hou&s;e upon a rock: And the rain de&s;cended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that hou&s;e: and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock."</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="030021_0019_0FE3C7544E90F160">MANY who have <HI>thought</HI> them&s;elves to be real &s;aints, and have been deemed &s;uch by others, may have their delu&s;ion di&s;covered, their garb of hypocri&s;y &s;tript off, and, peri&s;h: But every &s;oul, built on Chri&s;t by faith, will endure, notwith&s;tanding all the &s;torms of temptation, which may a&s;&s;ault him, and all the powers of darkne&s;s; <HI>for he is founded on a rock.</HI></P>
<P>CHRIST'S being compared to a rock, denotes his &s;trength and &s;tability&mdash;that he is able to uphold his church. And if he is able, we may be &s;ure that he will do it; for he hath expre&s;&s;ly promi&s;ed it. John vi. 37, 39. "All that the Father giveth me &s;hall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out. And this is the Father's will which hath &s;ent me, that of all which he hath given me, I &s;hould lo&s;e nothing, but &s;hould rai&s;e it up again at the la&s;t day." Al&s;o &s;ee John x. 27&mdash;29. "My &s;heep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. And I give unto them eternal life, and they &s;hall never peri&s;h, neither &s;hall any pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all: and none is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand." Here Chri&s;t declares, not only, that he will hold and &s;ave all that come unto him, but, that his <HI>Father,</HI> al&s;o, is engaged to hold them in his hand, that they may never peri&s;h.</P>
<P>THE &s;afety, and continuance of the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> church,
<PB N="22" REF="030021_0020_0FE3C75A1BE5A9A0">
to the end of the world, depend on the &s;ame founda|tion, viz. the promi&s;e and power of Chri&s;t. The power and providence of God have pre&s;erved the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> church in the world, from the beginning to the pre&s;ent time. When the world was de&s;troyed by a deluge, in Noah's day, the church was pre&s;erved in the ark. It was led, in &s;afety, through the red &s;ea, where the ho&s;ts of Egypt, pur&s;uing it, were drowned. It hath been pre&s;erved through many <HI>bloody,</HI> and <HI>fiery</HI> per&s;ecutions. It hath been pre&s;erved through the revolutions, which have taken place, in the kingdoms of this world. Nations have been di&s;per&s;ed, &s;ubdu|ed, and extirpated from the earth: but <HI>the vi&s;ible church</HI> hath &s;urvived.</P>
<P>SATAN hath often been di&s;appointed, and baffled, in his attempts to de&s;troy the church by per&s;ecutions, by their being over-ruled, in Divine Providence, &s;o as to have an oppo&s;ite tendency. Per&s;ecutions, &s;ometimes, have been the occa&s;ion of &s;preading the go&s;pel the more &s;peedily, and enlarging Chri&s;t's kingdom. This was the effect of a per&s;ecution in Jeru&s;alem, mentioned in the viiith of Acts: "And at that time there was a great per&s;ecution again&s;t the church which was at Jeru&s;alem, and they were all &s;cattered abroad, throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria. Therefore they that were &s;cattered abroad went every where preaching the word."</P>
<P>The things, which God hath done to pre&s;erve
<PB N="23" REF="030021_0021_0FE3C75F94837318">
and enlarge his church, may be con&s;idered as a &s;acred pledge, for the future accompli&s;hment of all his promi&s;es concerning the pro&s;perity and increa&s;e of his church, in the latter day. The church, which is compared to <HI>leaven,</HI> will be pre&s;erved, 'till it hath <HI>leavened the whole lump</HI>&mdash;'till it hath filled the whole world. For it is declared, by the &s;pirit of prophe|cy, that, "In the days of the&s;e kings" (tho&s;e &s;poken of in the preceding ver&s;es) "&s;hall the God of heaven &s;et up a kingdom, which &s;hall never be de&s;troyed: and the kingdom &s;hall not be le&s;t to other people, but it &s;hall break in pieces, and con&s;ume all tho&s;e kingdoms, and it &s;hall &s;tand forever.</P>

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WE ought all to be upon our guard, le&s;t we be found to aid &s;atan, in his attempts to injure the church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>WE have heard how he employeth mankind as in&s;truments to execute his projects. Therefore, let not tho&s;e, who as yet have not obeyed the go&s;pel, be prevailed upon, by any temptation, to per&s;i&s;t any longer in their di&s;obedience. Let not profe&s;&s;ors of religion be enticed, and drawn, into any conduct, which will wound the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t. Let us be|ware of embracing, or propagating, here&s;ies, and hurtful doctrines. When &s;atan &s;preads the&s;e, he puts on the appearance of great religion, and "trans|forms him&s;elf into an angel of light."</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="030021_0022_0FE3C7647B24F9D8">LET us have no hand in any kind of <HI>per&s;ecution</HI>: for this is the work of &s;atan. And how vain, and unrea&s;onable, is per&s;ecution! "Every plant," &s;aith Chri&s;t, "which my heavenly Father hath not plant|ed, &s;hall be rooted up." Gamaliel &s;aid, "Refrain from the&s;e men, and let them alone: for if this coun|&s;el or this work be of men, it will come to nought: But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; le&s;t hap|ly ye be found even to fight again&s;t God."</P>
<P>LET us al&s;o beware of &s;uper&s;tition, which is an enemy of true religion, and a weapon, with which &s;atan fights again&s;t the church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. THOSE may be pronounced <HI>ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> who belong to Chri&s;t's church.</P>
<P>THE <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> church is not meant here; for, though it may be con&s;idered as a great privilege to belong to <HI>that,</HI> merely <HI>that</HI> doth not en&s;ure one's happine&s;s. For &s;ome have a &s;tanding in the <HI>vi&s;ible,</HI> who do not appertain to the <HI>invi&s;ible,</HI> church of Chri&s;t. "All are not I&s;rael who are of I&s;rael." All the natural &s;eed, or de&s;cendants of I&s;rael, were not in reality God's people: So now all, who are of the <HI>vi&s;ible,</HI> are not of the <HI>invi&s;ible,</HI> church of Chri&s;t, which will eter|nally reign with him in glory. But all, who belong to the latter, that is, all who have ever heartily re|ceived Chri&s;t by faith, are &s;afe&mdash;their &s;alvation and eternal happine&s;s are &s;ure. They are built on a rock, and the gates of hell cannot prevail again&s;t them.

They will not fall away and peri&s;h; for Chri&s;t hath declared, that <HI>they &s;hall never peri&s;h,</HI> and that, <HI>none &s;hall pluck them out of his hand.</HI></P>
<P>BUT none be&s;ides the&s;e are &s;afe; none are happy. There is nothing durable in this world. Let us, then, all join to this happy kingdom. All are invi|ted, and <HI>he that cometh &s;hall in no wi&s;e he ca&s;t out.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. WE ought gratefully to remember and acknowl|edge God's goodne&s;s and faithfulne&s;s, di&s;played in redeeming, pre&s;erving, and &s;aving, his church.</P>
<P>WHAT goodne&s;s God hath di&s;covered, by giving his Son to redeem, and to be the foundation of, his church! What faithfulne&s;s God manife&s;teth, by pro|tecting, and finally &s;aving it, notwith&s;tanding all its <HI>external</HI> enemies, and <HI>internal</HI> corruptions!</P>
<P>WHAT infinite mercy and wi&s;dom God hath di&s;|covered, by pre&s;erving a <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> church in the world, through all pa&s;t ages&mdash;through times of darkne&s;s, &s;uper&s;tition, and ignorance&mdash;times of di&s;tre&s;s and per&s;ecution&mdash;times of infidelity and apo&s;tacy!

<P>WE have convened, at this time, to take notice of a &s;pecimen of this goodne&s;s and faithfulne&s;s of God, di&s;played, by his having pre&s;erved a vi&s;ible church, in <HI>this place,</HI> for &s;o con&s;iderable a length of time;&mdash;and, it is to be hoped, with a di&s;po&s;ition <HI>thankfully</HI> to acknowledge them.</P>
<P>THIS day completes one century, &s;ince a vi&s;ible
<PB N="26" REF="030021_0024_0FE3C76E6065EE18">
church was fir&s;t gathered in this place. And, as it is pre&s;umed that it will not be unacceptable to the auditory, a &s;ketch of its hi&s;tory will be recited. But, as the mo&s;t ancient records of this church, are entirely lo&s;t, a &s;hort and imperfect account, <HI>only,</HI> is to be expected.</P>
<P>IT is evident, from the date of the church's cove|nant and confe&s;&s;ion of faith, which have been pre|&s;erved, and from other te&s;timony, that the church, in this place, was e&s;tabli&s;hed, on Dec. 26th. A. D. 1694. O. S.; and, that the Reverend <HI>Samuel Fuller,</HI> a dea|con of the church in Plymouth, was, at the &s;ame time, ordained its Pa&s;tor. Of how many the church <HI>then</HI> con&s;i&s;ted, and who they were, no documents, which we have &s;een, give any information, except, that it con&s;i&s;ted partly of members from the church in Plymouth.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>FULLER</HI> continued but a &s;hort time after his ordination, dying Augu&s;t 17th. 1695, (as appeareth from his grave-&s;tone, which is yet legible) in the 71&s;t. year of his age. He was con&s;idered to be a &s;incerely godly man, and u&s;eful preacher. Before his ordina|tion, he had occa&s;ionally preached to this people, above &s;ixteen years. His death was con&s;idered as a great lo&s;s, and lamented by his people.</P>
<P>AFTER his decea&s;e, another deacon of Plymouth church, Mr. <HI>I&s;aac Cu&s;hman,</HI> was invited, by this church, to take the pa&s;toral charge of them. But
<PB N="27" REF="030021_0025_0FE3C7A7146B4B80">
he negatived their call, and &s;ettled in a contiguous pari&s;h, &s;ince called Plymton.</P>
<P>HOW long they continued de&s;titute, it cannot pre|ci&s;ely be a&s;certained; but, probably, it was not long after Mr. Fuller's death, when Mr. <HI>Thomas Palmer</HI> was ordained to the pa&s;toral office: For, June 30th. 1708, by the advice of an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Council of twelve churches, he was depo&s;ed from the mini&s;try, and laid under church cen&s;ure. And, &s;ome time previous to that, he had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by his church and congregation, and preached, in a private hou&s;e, to a party of his adherents.</P>
<P>THE Rev. <HI>Peter Thacher</HI> began to preach, in this place, Sept. 1707, and was ordained, Nov. 2d. 1709, to univer&s;al &s;atisfaction. How large the church was, when he took the Pa&s;toral charge of it, cannot be a&s;certained; but, during the whole of his mini&s;try, 402 were added to it. Having, to good acceptance, officiated as Pa&s;tor, about thirty five years, on the 22d. of April, 1744, he died, about fifty-five years of age.</P>
<P>SOME of the remarkable events, during his mini&s;|try, are the following: In March, A. D. 1718, the two deacons, <HI>John Bennet,</HI> and&mdash;<HI>Tinkham,</HI> died on the &s;ame week, and, (what is &s;till more extraordi|nary) the wife of each of them died, and was buried at the &s;ame time, and in the &s;ame grave, with her hu&s;band. About that time, &s;ickne&s;s and mortality
<PB N="28" REF="030021_0026_0FE3C7AB692E6B60">
prevailed in this place, and &s;everal other u&s;eful mem|bers of this church were taken away.</P>
<P>LUKE SHORT, a man, &s;uppo&s;ed to be an <HI>an hun|dred years old,</HI> was received into the church.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the clo&s;e of Mr. <HI>Thacher</HI>'s life, there was a remarkable revival of religion, in this place, as well as in various other places in all parts of the country; &s;o that, A. D. 1742, one hundred and forty eight were received into this church. But this reli|gious commotion was followed by an unhappy con|tention and divi&s;ion in this church, occa&s;ioned by the different opinions concerning it, which different per|&s;ons entertained. The contention was &s;o &s;harp, and party &s;pirit run &s;o high, as to occa&s;ion a divi&s;ion of this once happy people, and the &s;etting up of another meeting. A large marjority of the church, with the <HI>minor</HI> part of the &s;ociety, made choice of the Rev. <HI>Silvanus Conant</HI> for their Pa&s;tor, who was or|dained, March 28, 1745, within a year after Mr. <HI>Thacher</HI>'s death. The other part of the church, with the <HI>majority</HI> of the &s;ociety, the October following, &s;ettled Rev. <HI>Thomas Weld</HI>; who continued with them but a few years, his party gradually leaving <HI>him,</HI> and going to the other meeting, 'till at length <HI>he</HI> was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed; and then the church and &s;ociety, which had been rent a&s;under, were again happily united.</P>
<P>Mr. CONANT, a man, who&s;e memory is yet very dear to many of this audience, died Dec. 8, A. D.
<PB N="29" REF="030021_0027_0FE3C7B071CA9500">
1777, in the 58th year of his age, and 33d. of his mini&s;try; being called from his labours, in the mid&s;t of his u&s;efulne&s;s, and in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the love and e&s;teem of his large flock.</P>
<P>It doth not appear, that, during the whole of his mini&s;try, more than &s;eventy five were added to this church.</P>
<P>THE church remained de&s;titute of a pa&s;tor, after his decea&s;e, about four years, in which time only four members were added.</P>
<P>Their <HI>pre&s;ent Pa&s;tor</HI> was ordained, Dec. 5, 1781; &s;ince which time, ju&s;t as many have been admitted into the church, as were, during Mr. Conant's min|i&s;try. And in one of the&s;e, we have an in&s;tance of longevity, nearly equal to the one in Mr. Thacher's day, already mentioned. The widow <HI>Hannah Tink|ham,</HI> Nov. 6, 1788, delivered to the church and others, by the word of mouth, a rational and affecting account of the religious exerci&s;es of her heart&mdash;received the ordinance of bapti&s;m, and was admitted to full communion with the church, being <HI>ninety four</HI> years old. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She died, March <HI>25, 1792.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>AN accurate li&s;t of tho&s;e who have officiated as deacons in this church, by rea&s;on of the deficiency of the church records, cannot be given. But it ap|peareth, that &s;ome of the deacons were inducted into their office, in a very <HI>&s;olemn</HI> manner. <HI>Samuel Bar|rows</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="030021_0028_0FE3C7B4E4E80368">
and <HI>Ephraim Wood,</HI> July 25, 1725, were or|dained to the office of deacon, having <HI>previou&s;ly</HI> been proved above two years. A &s;olemn charge was giv|en them, <HI>faithfully</HI> to perform the work, incumbent on that office, which charge was preceded and fol|lowed by prayer; al&s;o, as a token of their being ac|cepted in that office, the <HI>right hand</HI> was given them by the Pa&s;tor. The only other &s;imilar in&s;tance was in March, A. D. 1737, when Samuel Wood, and Ebenezer Finney, having been elected to that office, previou&s;ly, more than two years, were ordained.</P>
<P>THIS church hath been dimini&s;hed, at various times, by &s;upplying members for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of other churches&mdash;as that in Halifax, and tho&s;e in the &s;econd and third Precincts of this town; be&s;ides many, who have emigrated to Vermont, and other places. But it is &s;till pre&s;erved. <HI>Hitherto the Lord hath helped us.</HI> How much longer it will continue, God only knoweth. No particular <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> church is &s;ure of remaining; though Chri&s;t will have a church in the world, to the end of time. Sometimes, when a church becomes corrupt, and <HI>lukewarm,</HI> Chri&s;t &s;pues it out of his mouth.</P>
<P>LET us, therefore, <HI>be watchful, and &s;trengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die.</HI> Let us take heed, that we do not corrupt our ways, nor the or|dinances of God. Let us &s;peedily reform in every particular, in which we have erred from the rule of
<PB N="31" REF="030021_0029_0FE3C77323F82CF8">
God's word, and followed the traditions of men. And let us all remember the need there is of <HI>watch|fulne&s;s</HI> in tho&s;e, who belong to Chri&s;t's kingdom. They have powerful, crafty, and malicious enemies, who are con&s;tantly &s;eeking their de&s;truction. There|fore, let us comply with the exhortation of the apo&s;|tle, in tho&s;e words: "Finally, my brethren, be &s;trong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to &s;tand again&s;t the wiles of the devil. For we wre&s;|tle not again&s;t fle&s;h and blood, but again&s;t principal|ities, again&s;t powers, again&s;t the rulers of the dark|ne&s;s of this world, again&s;t &s;piritual wickedne&s;&s;es in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to with&s;tand in the evil day, and having done all, to &s;tand."</P>
<P>"NOW unto him who is able to keep you from falling, and to pre&s;ent you faultle&s;s before the pre&s;ence of his glory, with exceeding joy&mdash;to the only wi&s;e God our Saviour, be glory and maje&s;ty, dominion and power, both now and ever. AMEN."</P>
