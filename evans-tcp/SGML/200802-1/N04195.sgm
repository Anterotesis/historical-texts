Soul of Man is by far the greate&s;t and mo&s;t glorious Piece of divine Workman&s;hip, of all the Creatures on this lower Creation. And therefore it was the more meet that, however &s;econd Cau&s;es &s;hould be improved in the Production of meaner Creatures; yet this, which is the chief and mo&s;t noble of all, and the Crown and End of all the re&s;t, &s;hould be re&s;erved to be the more immediate Work of God's own Hands, and di&s;|play of his Power, and to be communicated directly from him, without the Intervention of In&s;truments, or honouring &s;econd Cau&s;es &s;o much as to improve them in bringing to pa&s;s &s;o noble an Effect.&mdash;'Tis ob&s;ervable that even in the fir&s;t Creation of Man, when his Body was formed immediately by God, not in a Cour&s;e of Nature, or in the Way of natural Pro|pagation; yet the Soul is repre&s;ented as being in a higher, more direct and immediate Manner from God, and &s;o communicated that God did therein as it were communicate &s;omething of him&s;elf: <HI>The Lord God formed Man</HI> (i. e. his Body) <HI>of the Du&s;t of the Ground,</HI> (a mean and vile Original) <HI>and breathed into his No&s;trils the Breath of Life;</HI> (whereby &s;omething was commu|nicated from an infinitely higher Source, even God's own living Spirit or divine vital Fullne&s;s) <HI>and</HI> &s;o <HI>Man became a living Soul.</HI></P>
<P>The Souls of Men being thus in a &s;pecial Manner from God, God is repre&s;ented as having a &s;pecial Propriety in them, Ezek. 18. 4. <HI>Behold all Souls are mine: As the Soul of the Father, &s;o al&s;o the Soul of the Son is mine.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005172_0009_1016CF05A313D008">
And as the Souls of Men are more directly from God, by the more &s;pecial and immediate Exerci&s;e of his divine Power as a Creator, and are what he chal|lenges as his by a &s;pecial Propriety, and are the mo&s;t noble Part of the lower Creation, and are infinitely di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other Creatures here below in that they are immortal Beings; &s;o they are, above all other Creatures which God hath made in this World, the Subjects of God's Care and &s;pecial Providence.</P>
<P>Divines are won't to di&s;tingui&s;h between God's common and &s;pecial Providence. His common Pro|vidence is that which he exerci&s;es towards all his Crea|tures, rational and irrational, animate and inanimate, in pre&s;erving them, and di&s;po&s;ing of them by his mighty Power, and according to his &s;overeign Plea|&s;ure. His &s;pecial Providence is that which he exer|ci&s;es towards his intelligent rational Creatures, as mo|ral Agents; of which Sort are Mankind alone, of all the innumerable Kinds of Creatures in this lower World: And in a &s;pecial Manner the Souls of Men; for in them only is immediately &s;eated Rea&s;on and Intelligence, and a Capacity of moral Agency; and therefore they in a peculiar Manner are the Sub|jects of God's &s;pecial Providence that he exerci&s;es in this lower World. And 'tis be to ob&s;erved that God's common Providence is &s;ubordinated to his &s;pecial Pro|vidence; and all Things in this World are govern'd and di&s;po&s;ed of in Subordination to the great Ends God has to obtain with Re&s;pect to the Souls of Men. And it is further to be ob&s;erved that as the Creation of
<PB N="12" REF="005172_0010_1016CF0800C55B70">
the World was committed to the Son of God by, the Father, &s;o is the Government of it; and in a pecu|liar Manner the Affairs of God's &s;pecial Providence, are left in his Hands; and &s;o the Souls of Men, that are the peculiar Subjects of this &s;pecial Providence are committed to his Care; and more e&s;pecially &s;uch Souls as are of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible Kingdom or Church, which is often in Scripture repre&s;ented as the Field and Vineyard that he is the Owner of and has taken the Care of.&mdash;And what Chri&s;t's Value is for Mens Souls appears by what he has done and &s;uffered for them.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Souls that Chri&s;t has made, and that are committed into his Hands of the Father, and that are &s;o precious in his Account, he commits to the Care of Mini&s;ters. There is a certain Order of Men that are &s;o dignified and honoured by him, as to have &s;o great a Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them. He as it were brings tho&s;e Souls as an infinitely precious Trea&s;ure, and commits 'em to them to take Care of; as a Prince commits his Trea&s;ure, his Jewels, and mo&s;t precious Things into the Hands of one of the dignified Servants of his Hou&s;hold; or as the Father of a Family, when he goes a Journey into a far Country, leaves his Fa|mily to the Care of a Steward.</P>
<P>I come now in the</P>
<P>IId Place, to enquire <HI>to what Purpo&s;e Chri&s;t commits <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Souls of Men to the Care of Mini&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005172_0011_1016CF0AC1548F98">
I an&s;wer in two Things,</P>
<P N="1">1. He commits Mens Souls to Mini&s;ters to keep and take Care of them for him, that by their Means they may an&s;wer their End in glorifying him. God has made all Things for him&s;elf, he has created them for his Glory; but more e&s;pecially tho&s;e Creatures that he has endued with Under&s;tanding, as he has done the Souls of Men: It is by them that God has his Glory from all his Creatures, as they are the Eye of the Creation to behold the Glory of God manife&s;ted in the other Creatures, and the Mouth of the Crea|tion to prai&s;e him and a&s;cribe to him the Glory that is di&s;played in them. The other Creatures glorify God pa&s;&s;ively and eventually, as God glorifies him&s;elf in them, as they are the Subjects of the Exerci&s;e of his Power and Wi&s;dom in their Creation and Pre&s;ervation, and in tho&s;e Events that are brought to pa&s;s in his Di&s;po&s;al of them. Thus God glorifies him&s;elf in his Works that are manife&s;t in the irrational and inani|mate Creation, in the View of his rational Creatures that he has made capable of beholding and admiring them, and adoring, loving and prai&s;ing him for them: But they only are capable of glorifying him actively and immediately; therefore all the other Creatures do as it were bring their Tribute of Glory to them, thro' their Hands, to be offered to their Creator. And therefore the Souls of Men are Beings that, with Regard to the Glory of God the great End of all Things, are of immen&s;ely greater Importance than all other Creatures in this lower World. But the&s;e, with Re&s;pect to this their great End, are committed
<PB N="14" REF="005172_0012_1016CF0D3B1774E8">
to the Care and Keeping of Mini&s;ters. And there|fore Chri&s;t has furni&s;hed them with proper Means to bring them to this End: He has given 'em all need|ful In&s;tructions; they have a perfect Rule and Direc|tory to guide them in this great Affair; and has en|join'd them the Duties they are to perform in their Office in every particular, and the Manner in which they are to perform the&s;e Duties, in the Charge which he has left them; and has furni&s;hed them with all needful Helps for the In&s;truction of tho&s;e Souls that are committed to them, to lead 'em to an&s;wer their great End, in duely glorifying their Creator, and all proper Means for the exciting and engaging them to attend to, and follow tho&s;e In&s;tructions, as al&s;o Means for their Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance in it, that they may do it the more ea&s;ily and effectually.</P>
<P N="2">2. They are committed to their Care and Keep|ing that they may not be eternally lo&s;t, but may have everla&s;ting Life. The&s;e Souls, as I ob&s;erved before, are immortal and made for Eternity; and they are &s;et in this World between two oppo&s;ite eternal States, the one a State of exceeding and eternal Glory and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, the other a State of unutterable and un|alterable Mi&s;ery: And as they are by Nature they are liable to either; by their original Guilt and Corrup|tion they are expo&s;ed to peri&s;h forever, in total and perfect De&s;truction and Mi&s;ery: But Chri&s;t, from his Knowledge of the infinite Worth of Souls, and his great Compa&s;&s;ion and Love to 'em, has, by his own precious Blood, made Way for their E&s;cape, and at
<PB N="15" REF="005172_0013_1016CF0FA34A64B0">
this infinite Expence, has procured un&s;peakable Ex|altation and perfect Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s for them in Heaven to all Eternity; which by this Means they have Op|portunity to obtain. But yet it remains uncertain what will become of them, 'till Chri&s;t's Redemption be applied to them, or they are actually ca&s;t into Hell: There is an Opportunity given, a Time of Probation, 'till the great and unalterable Event &s;hall determine one Way or the other. In the mean Time there is a Space for the U&s;e of Means, and the Exer|ci&s;e of Care, Prudence and Diligence for our own Souls and the Souls of others; that they may not fail of the Grace of God, but may e&s;cape that infinitely dreadful De&s;truction that they are naturally in Danger of, and may indeed obtain that infinite Priviledge of eternal Life, that is offered through the Purcha&s;e of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And now in this grand Affair, and to this great Purpo&s;e of an E&s;cape from eternal Mi&s;ery, and the obtaining everla&s;ting Glory, Chri&s;t has com|mitted the precious Souls of Men to the Care of Mi|ni&s;ters; that by their Means they may have the Bene|fit of his Redemption, and might obtain that which he has &s;uffered &s;o much to procure. Chri&s;t knew that notwith&s;tanding all that he had done to procure Life for Souls, they would need much Care to be taken of them, and many Means to be u&s;ed with them, in order to their being indeed pre&s;erved from eternally peri&s;hing, and actually brought to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Life: And therefore he has appointed a certain Order of Men, who&s;e whole Bu&s;ine&s;s it might be to take Care of immortal Souls; and into their Hands has
<PB N="16" REF="005172_0014_1016CF120ADD6328">
committed the&s;e Souls, and has betru&s;ted them with the Ordinances of his Hou&s;e, and Means that he has provided for their Salvation; that nothing might be wanting that they need for their Furniture for this great Bu&s;ine&s;s; he has as it were committed to them his Goods, and has given them in &s;ome Re&s;pects the Keys of his Stores and Trea&s;ury; to them are com|mitted the Oracles of God and Trea&s;ure of the Go&s;|pel. 2 Cor. 4. 7. <HI>We have this Trea&s;ure in earthen Ve&s;&s;els.</HI> And Chap. 5. 18, 19. <HI>And all Things are of God, who hath reconciled us to him&s;elf by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and hath given to us the Mini&s;try of Reconciliation, to wit, that God was in Chri&s;t reconciling the World unto him&s;elf, not imputing their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es unto them, and hath committed to us the Word of Reconciliation.</HI></P>
<P>And as the Word of God, &s;o the Sacraments that he has appointed, and the Di&s;cipline of his Hou&s;e, he has committed to them, to be admini&s;tred by them; and has &s;ubjected the Souls them&s;elves that they have the Care of to them, as far as is nece&s;&s;ary to put them under the greate&s;t Advantage effectually to care for their Salvation, and has left a Charge to their People to obey them and &s;ubmit them&s;elves, as in the Ver&s;e of my Text.</P>
<P>I now proceed</P>
<P>III. To ob&s;erve, <HI>that the Way in which he who has committed Souls to Mini&s;ters, expects they &s;hould &s;eek that the&s;e Purpo&s;es may be obtained with Re&s;pect to them, is by watching for them,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="005172_0015_1016CF1482F727C0">
Tho' great Things have been done by Chri&s;t to make Way for the Salvation of tho&s;e precious Souls, and altho' Chri&s;t has furni&s;hed Mini&s;ters with all proper Means to keep them; yet they are in &s;uch Circum|&s;tances in this World, that there is Need of the Exer|ci&s;e of great Watchfulne&s;s, and the utmo&s;t Care and Diligence, in tho&s;e that have the Care of them, to prevent their being lo&s;t: for they are in the Mid&s;t of Snares, and encompa&s;s'd round with Dangers on every Side; they are in the Enemies Country, where there are Multitudes every where that are &s;trong and &s;ubtil and exceeding Blood-thir&s;ty and cruel, that are inde|fatigably, Day and Night, &s;eeking the De&s;truction of the&s;e Souls.</P>
<P>If a Prince &s;hould commit &s;ome great Trea&s;ure, con&s;i&s;ting of mo&s;t precious Jewels, to the Care of a Subject, to keep for him, and carry thro' an Enemy's Country, and bring home &s;afe to his Palace, and knew that the Enemies by the Way would be &s;en&s;ible that the Trea&s;ure was committed to him, and would be aware of the great Value of it, and therefore would be exceeding greedy of it, and ince&s;&s;ant in their En|deavours to get it from him; would not the Prince ex|pect that he, with whom he had entru&s;ted this Trea|&s;ure, &s;hould u&s;e great Care in keeping it? Would he be e&s;teemed faithful to his Tru&s;t, in the&punc; Care of &s;o great a Trea&s;ure, and in &s;uch Circum&s;tances, with|out keeping up a continual Watch?</P>

They that have the Care of a City in Time of War, and e&s;pecially at a Time when the City is en|compa&s;&s;ed by Enemies that lay Siege to it, are wont, if faithful, to maintain ince&s;&s;ant Vigilance to defend it: The Watchmen of the City in &s;uch a Ca&s;e had need to watch &s;trictly, for they have the Care of the Lives of Men.&mdash;Mini&s;ters are from Time to Time repre&s;ented in Scripture as the Watchmen that have the Care of the City of God; as <HI>Cant.</HI> 3. 3. &amp; 5. 7. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 52. 8. and 62. 6. and in other Places.

<P>Mini&s;ters are appointed to be Shepherds over Chri&s;t's Flock; and he commits his Flock to their Care to keep 'em and lead 'em thro' a great and howling Wilderne&s;s, full of hungry Wolves and roaring Lions: And is there not need of a &s;trict and con&s;tant Watch

<P>I come now to the</P>
<P>IVth and la&s;t Thing in the doctrinal Handling of the Text, <HI>viz. That Mini&s;ters hereafter mu&s;t give Account to him that committed Men's precious Souls to their Care.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;t's committing Souls to Mini&s;ter's Care and Charge, and betru&s;ting them with them as Servants or Stewards, nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es them to be accoun|table to their Ma&s;ter with Re&s;pect to the Charge committed to them.</P>
<P>He that has a Trea&s;ure committed to him by the Owner, and takes the Care and Charge of it, not as his own Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but only to improve or keep for an appointed Time, for him to whom the proper Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion belongs, mu&s;t return that Trea&s;ure to the Owner when his Time is out, and is accountable to him how he has fulfilled that which he undertook; and if any precious Jewel be mi&s;&s;ing, he mu&s;t give an Account of it.&mdash;So mu&s;t Mini&s;ters give an Account of the Souls committed to their Care.</P>
<P>The Office and Work of Mini&s;ters is not to la&s;t always; their Care of Souls is but for a limited Sea|&s;on; and when that is expired, they mu&s;t return to their Ma&s;ter to give an Account.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="005172_0018_1016CF1BCB5AF798">
After what Manner they mu&s;t be called to an Ac|count, may be &s;hewn in the&s;e two Things,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Event of Things with Regard to the Souls committed to them will be enquired into. As there are &s;o many precious Souls committed to their Care by Chri&s;t, &s;o hereafter it will be enquired what is be|come of tho&s;e Souls. As if a Per&s;on has a Number of precious Jewels committed to him to keep; when the Time of his Betru&s;tment is out, and he comes to re|turn the intru&s;ted Trea&s;ure, the State of it will be examined, that it may be &s;een whether any Jewel be lacking or not; and if any be mi&s;&s;ing, an Account mu&s;t be given what is become of it. The Charge of a Mini&s;ter is in Scripture repre&s;ented by that of a Steward, to whom the Hou&s;holder, when going into a far Country, commits his Goods, and when he re|turns, expects that the Steward &s;hould give an Ac|count of his Steward&s;hip. In &s;uch a Ca&s;e the Hou&s;|holder looks into the State of his Goods that he left behind under the Steward's Care. The Ma&s;ter in the Parable, <HI>Matth.</HI> 25. 14, &amp;c. when he returns from his Journey, has his Goods, that he committed to the Care of his Servants, brought forth and laid be|fore him.</P>
<P N="2">2. It will be enquired how far the Event that &s;hall be found, with Regard to Souls committed to them, was owning to their Faithfulne&s;s or Unfaithfulne&s;s in that Care and Watch that was appointed them. If any precious Soul be found lacking, it will be enquired how this comes to pa&s;s; they mu&s;t give an Account
<PB N="21" REF="005172_0019_1016CF1F19C10C50">
what they have done with this and that Soul that is mi&s;&s;ing, whether they were lo&s;t thro' their Neglect or no: they mu&s;t give an Account what Care they have taken, and what Diligence they have u&s;ed, and whether or no they can wa&s;h their Hands from Guilt with Re&s;pect to them: it &s;hall be examined by an Eye that is as a Flame of Fire, whether the Blood of the Souls that are lo&s;t is not indeed to be found in their Skirts.&mdash;We find in the Parable of the great Supper, that the Servants that are &s;ent out to invite Gue&s;ts, return from Time to Time to their Ma&s;ter to give him an Account both of the Event in their Suc|ce&s;s with Re&s;pect to &s;ome that they were &s;ent to, and Un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s with Regard to others; and al&s;o of their own Doings and Faithfulne&s;s, whereby they are clear of the Guilt of their Un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s, and are commended to the gracious Reward of their Succe&s;s. <HI>Luke</HI> 14. 20, 21.

this Place. I be&s;eech you now to &s;uffer the Word of Exhortation on this &s;olemn Occa&s;ion: Suffer me to put you in Mind how great the Per&s;on is, with whom you are immediately and chiefly concerned in the Affair of this Day; even the great Shepherd of the Sheep, and glorious Lord of Heaven and Earth, who is to be your and our Judge. You pre&s;ent your &s;elf this Day before him to receive at his Hands a &s;acred <HI>Depo&s;itum,</HI> a great Trea&s;ure, a Number of Souls that are to exi&s;t throughout all Eternity, each one of which is infinitely more precious than all the precious Gems that the Earth affords. And I be&s;eech you to con&s;i|der to how great a Purpo&s;e he is about to commit them to your Care and Keeping; it is that they, by Means of your faithful Care and Watchfulne&s;s, may be &s;aved with an everla&s;ting Salvation. You may judge how much Chri&s;t will in&s;i&s;t upon it that you &s;hou'd exerci&s;e great Diligence and Strictne&s;s in the Care you take of them, by the Value he him&s;elf has manife&s;ted of the Souls of Men, by what he has done and &s;uffered for them: he has &s;hewn how precious he has judged immortal Souls to be, in that he, tho' a Per&s;on of infinite Glory, did not think his own Blood, his Life, his Soul, too pre|cious to be offered up as a Price for them to redeem them, that they might obtain that Salvation in order to which he now is about to commit a Number of them to your Care, and to betru&s;t you with the Means that he has provided for that End; committing to you his holy Oracles, and the Food of his Hou&s;e, which is his own Body and Blood, that therewith you might feed the&s;e Souls; and in &s;ome Sen&s;e committing to

you the Keys of his Stores and Trea&s;ures, that you might &s;upply and enrich them, and be a Means of their eternal Wealth and Glory.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, <HI>dear Sir,</HI> how great an Honour he does you whom God the Father hath made Head of the whole Univer&s;e, and Lord of all Things to the Church; that after he has provided for the Salvation of Souls by his dying Pains and precious Blood, and the Father has committed to him all Power in Heaven and Earth, that he might actually be&s;tow eternal Life on them that he died for; he &s;hould call you to be a Co-worker with him, and &s;hould commit precious Souls to your Care, that you might be the In&s;trument of bringing them home to him, and bringing that to pa&s;s with Re&s;pect to them, for which his Soul travailed in the Agonies of Death, and in ineffable Conflicts with the dreadful Wrath of God. You are now about to re|ceive the precious Trea&s;ure at his Hands, which you are to keep for him: you pre&s;ent your &s;elf here before the Lord for this End, that you may as it were reach forth your Hand and take this great <HI>Depo&s;itum,</HI> with &s;olemn Vow diligently and faithfully to keep it, and devote your &s;elf to that Service; &s;o that if it be po&s;&s;ible for you to prevent it, no one of tho&s;e infinitely pre|cious Jewels may be lo&s;t, but that you may return them all &s;afe to him from who&s;e Hands you receive them.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider the Example of your glorious Lord and Ma&s;ter: There was a Number of the Souls of Men
<PB N="24" REF="005172_0022_1016CF25B2538B80">
committed by the Father into his Hands, that he might take Care for their Salvation: And after what Man|ner did he execute his Office? How did he lay out him&s;elf for the Salvation of tho&s;e Souls? What great Things did he do? And what great Things did he &s;uffer? How hard was the Labour he went thro'? And how greatly did he deny him&s;elf? How did this great Shepherd of the Sheep behave him&s;elf when he &s;aw the Wolf coming to de&s;troy the Sheep? He did not flee to &s;ave his own Life, and &s;o leave the Sheep to become a Prey; but from Pity and Love to the Sheep, interpo&s;ed him&s;elf between them and their Enemy, &s;tood between them and Harm, and encounter'd the Wolf, and in the Conflict gave his own Life to &s;ave their's, <HI>John</HI> 10. 11,&mdash;15.&mdash;We read of Chri&s;t's travailing for Souls, I&s;ai. 53. 10, 11. <HI>It plea&s;ed the Lord to brui&s;e him, he hath put him to Grief. When thou &s;halt make his Soul an Offering for Sin, he &s;hall &s;ee his Seed.</HI>&mdash;<HI>He &s;hall &s;ee of</HI> the Travail of his Soul, <HI>and &s;hall be &s;atisfied.</HI> And how did he Travail for this Seed of his? Look into the Garden of <HI>Geth&s;emane,</HI> and there behold him lying on the Earth, with his Body covered over with clotted Blood, falling down in Lumps to the Ground, with his Soul exceeding &s;or|rowful even unto Death, and offering up &s;trong Cry|ing and Tears together with his Blood: and look to the Cro&s;s, where he endured yet far more extreme Agonies, and drank up the bitter Cup of God's Wrath, and &s;hed the Remainder of his Blood, lingeringly drain'd out thro' his tortur'd Hands and Feet, and extrava&s;ated out of his broken Heart into his Bowels,
<PB N="25" REF="005172_0023_1016CF292A4D77C0">
and there turned into Blood and Water, thro' the ve|hement Fermentation occa&s;ion'd by the Weight of Grief and Extremity of Agony of Soul, under which he cried out with that loud and lamentable and re|peated Cry. Thus he travailed in Birth with his Seed; thus he laboured and &s;uffered for the Salvation of tho&s;e Souls that the Father had committed to him. This is the Example of the great Shepherd. And tho' it is not required of Under-Shepherds that they &s;hould endure Sufferings of &s;uch a Degree or Nature; for Chri&s;t has &s;uffered them to that End, that both Mini|&s;ters and People might e&s;cape them; yet &s;urely he expects that, as they would approve them&s;elves as his Di&s;ciples and Followers and Co-workers with him in &s;eeking the Salvation of the &s;ame Souls, they &s;hould not be backward to go thro' any Labours or Sufferings which may be requi&s;ite in them, in order to their mo&s;t effectually promoting the great End of his Sufferings, with Regard to the Souls that he has committed to them.</P>
<P>And as you, <HI>dear Sir,</HI> are to &s;tand in Chri&s;t's Stead towards this People, and to act as his Amba&s;&s;ador; &s;hould you not &s;how the like Spirit, the like Love to Souls, and imitate him in his Readine&s;s to labour and deny your &s;elf and &s;uffer, yea to &s;pend and be &s;pent for them? Like the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 15.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e with you, <HI>Sir,</HI> is as if the Head of a Fa|mily, that was a great Prince, with a Number of Children in a &s;trange Land, when going home to re|ceive

<P>II. I would apply my &s;elf to tho&s;e who&s;e Souls are now about to be committed to the Care of that Ser|vant of Chri&s;t that is now to be ordained to the pa&s;to|ral Office in this Place.</P>
<P><HI>Beloved Brethren, and dear Children,</HI> 'Tis your im|mortal Souls that is the precious Trea&s;ure that the great Creator and Saviour of Souls &s;eems now to be about to commit to the Care of him whom you have cho&s;en to be your Pa&s;tor. And indeed it is a great Charge, an high Betru&s;tment; and he ought to u&s;e his utmo&s;t Care and Diligence that you may not be eternally lo&s;t: But if your Pa&s;tor &s;hould exerci&s;e &s;uch Care that you may be &s;aved, &s;urely you ought to take Care for the Salvation of your own Souls: It nearly concerns him that you &s;hould be &s;aved; but much more nearly does it concern you. Let your Mini&s;ter be never &s;o careful and watchful, if you take no Care for your &s;elves, his Faithfulne&s;s and Diligence will &s;ignify nothing, unle&s;s it be to harden you, and aggra|vate your Damnation: In &s;uch a Ca&s;e, the more Care and Pains he takes for your Salvation, the greater will your eternal Mi&s;ery be: for all will be only a Savour of Death unto Death: Tho&s;e People are like to &s;ink the deepe&s;t into Hell hereafter, that go to Hell from under the Care of the mo&s;t faithful Mini&s;ters, that
<PB N="30" REF="005172_0028_1016CF366F8DB4C0">

The Preciou&s;ne&s;s of your Souls has now been made u&s;e of as an Argument with your cho&s;en Pa&s;tor to take Care for your Salvation; but much more may it be u&s;ed as an Argument with you to &s;eek your own Salvation; for therein lies the Preciou&s;ne&s;s of your Souls, in their being of infinite Worth to your &s;elves, appearing in the infinite Lo&s;s you will &s;u&s;tain if they are lo&s;t, and your infinite Gain if they are &s;aved; herein lies that Preciou&s;ne&s;s of the Soul that Chri&s;t &s;peaks of, Matth. 16. 26. <HI>For what is a Man pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">d, if he &s;hall gain the whole World, and loo&s;e his own Soul?

<P>'Tis not only your Mini&s;ter that is concerned in the Work that he is to perform among you, but you al&s;o are infinitely concerned in it: And it is not only he, but you al&s;o that are infinitely concerned in the Account that he has to give of the Di&s;charge of his Office among you.

Ezek. 33. 2, 3, 4. <HI>Son of Man, &s;peak to the Children of thy People, and &s;ay unto them, when I bring the Sword upon a Land, if the People of the Land take a Man of their Coa&s;ts and &s;et him for their Watchman, if when he &s;ee the Sword come upon the Land, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">

Trumpet and warn the People; then who&s;oever heareth the Sound of the Trumpet, and taketh not Warning, if the Sword come and take him away, his Blood &s;hall be upon his own Head.</HI> The good Account your Mini&s;ter has to give of his own Faithfulne&s;s, will incen&s;e the Di&s;|plea&s;ure of the Judge towards you.

<P>And if you would have the Account your Mini&s;ter &s;hall have to give concerning you to be profitable and joyful to you, don't neglect your Duty towards him; endeavour by all Means in your Power to put him under the be&s;t Advantage for Serviceablene&s;s and Suc|ce&s;s among you: Do what in you lies to encourage his Heart and &s;trengthen his Hands. This I know to be a Thing of va&s;t Importance, as you would have your Pa&s;tor a Ble&s;&s;ing to you, and the &s;ucce&s;sful In|&s;trument of the Salvation of your Souls and the Souls of your Children: Therefore &s;uffer me to be a little particular with you upon this Head: I may be the more bold towards you as you hitherto have been of the Flock that Chri&s;t has committed to my Care, and I hope &s;ome of you my &s;piritual Children; therefore as my beloved Children I coun&s;el and warn you.</P>
<P>If you would meet your Mini&s;ter with Comfort another Day, don't neglect doing what belongs to you comfortably to &s;upport him, &s;o as to enable him to attend on his great Work without Di&s;traction, and to

While we are in the Body our heavenly Father knows that we have need of the&s;e Things, and the Way that he hath provided for Mini&s;ters &s;upply, is by their partaking of the temporal good Things of the People to whom they mini&s;ter &s;piritual Things. 1 Cor. 9. 4, &amp;c. <HI>Have we not Power to eat and to drink?

And &s;ince what is given to your Pa&s;tor is given to Chri&s;t, you may be a&s;&s;ured that you can't con&s;ult your own temporal, as well as &s;piritual Intere&s;t better, than by liberally &s;upplying of him; for he that lend|eth to the Lord &s;hall be repay'd again with large In|tere&s;t.

<P>And here let me wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> you in particular, that you don't only do pretty well by your Mini&s;ter for a while at fir&s;t, while the Relation between you and him is a new Thing, and then afterwards, when your Mini|&s;ter's Nece&s;&s;ities are encrea&s;ed, begin to fail, as it too frequently happens.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="005172_0036_1016CF49B61E3B98">
Some may be ready to &s;ay, 'Tis no wonder Mini|&s;ters &s;hould be forward to urge &s;uch a Duty as this, wherein their own temporal Intere&s;t is &s;o much con|cerned, a coveteous Di&s;po&s;ition will make 'em love to harp upon this String.&mdash;I have not been much in in&s;i&s;ting on this Duty in my own Pulpit, where it would e&s;pecially concern my temporal Intere&s;t; and ble&s;&s;ed be God that I have had no more Occa&s;ion.&mdash;But whatever any may judge of the Secrets of my Heart, with Regard to the Principles that I have been influenced by, in what I have now &s;aid; it is enough for you to whom I have &s;poke it, that I have demon|&s;trated that what I have deliver'd is the Mind of God; and al&s;o (if there be any Truth in his Word) that what I have recommended is not only for the tempo|ral Intere&s;t of your Mini&s;ter, but al&s;o for your own both temporal and &s;piritual Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Another Article of Advice that I would give you, is, to beware that you don't weaken your Mini&s;ter's Hands, and wound your &s;elves by Contention. You are but a &s;mall People, and you'll be a very fooli&s;h People indeed if you are divided again&s;t your&s;elves. Conten|tion among a People hinders all Manner of Comfort and Pro&s;perity either of Soul or Body; it makes 'em a Torment to them&s;elves and one another; it puts 'em every Way under Di&s;advantages, and weakens the whole Body like a Con&s;umption.</P>
<P>There are two Sorts of Contention I would warn you again&s;t,</P>
<P N="1">1. Avoid Contention among your &s;elves about your own temporal Affairs: This will exceedingly tend to
<PB N="39" REF="005172_0037_1016CF4D9C72EDB0">
render a Mini&s;ter's Labours ineffectual; and it is what greatly damps the Spirit and di&s;courages the Heart of a Mini&s;ter, to &s;ee his People divided into Parties, and envying one another, and entertaining mutual Preju|dices, Jealou&s;ies and Grudges, and &s;o backbiting and reproaching one another, and carrying on &s;ecret Plots and De&s;igns one again&s;t another.</P>
<P N="2">2. Avoid quarrelling with your Mini&s;ter in Matters of Church Di&s;cipline: This is a common Thing, but a mo&s;t unchri&s;tian Thing, and tends greatly to weaken the Hands of a Mini&s;ter in the whole of his Work, and render all to no Purpo&s;e. The Exerci&s;e of the Di&s;cipline of God's Hou&s;e is the mo&s;t difficult Part of that great Work that a Mini&s;ter has to do; and it becomes a chri&s;tian People to their utmo&s;t to &s;trengthen their Mini&s;ter's Hands in this difficult Bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ay as the People &s;aid to <HI>Ezra</HI> the Prie&s;t, with Re&s;pect to the Affair of purging the Church of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> from the Scandal of tho&s;e that had married &s;trange Wives, Ezra 10. 4. <HI>Ari&s;e, for this Matter belongeth to thee; we al&s;o will be with thee: Be of good Courage and do it.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude, If you would have your Mini&s;ter &s;ucce&s;sful among you, and a Ble&s;&s;ing to you, and if you would be a happy People, then love one another and love your Mini&s;ter. There are &s;ome Profe&s;&s;ors, in &s;ome of our Towns, that are anti-mini&s;terial Men; they &s;eem to have a Di&s;po&s;ition to di&s;like Men of that Or|der; they are apt to be prejudiced again&s;t them, &amp; to be &s;u&s;picious of them, and talk again&s;t them; and it &s;eems to be as it were natural to 'em to be unfriendly and
<PB N="40" REF="005172_0038_1016CF5168BC2578">
unkind towards their own Mini&s;ters, and to make Difficulty for them: But I don't believe there is a true Chri&s;tian on Earth that is of this Character; on the contrary the Feet of them that bring good Ty|dings, and publi&s;h the Go&s;pel of Salvation are beauti|ful in the Eyes of all the true Children of <HI>Zion;</HI> and every one that receives Chri&s;t, and who&s;e Heart is govern'd by a &s;upream Love to him, has a Di&s;po&s;ition to receive, love and honour his Me&s;&s;engers. It was the di&s;tingui&s;hing Mark by which God manife&s;ted the Per&s;on he had cho&s;en to be the Wife of <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> that Type of Chri&s;t, that it was the Dam&s;el that &s;hould give kind and friendly Entertainment to <HI>Abraham'</HI>s Servant or Steward that was &s;ent to e&s;pou&s;e her and bring her home to <HI>I&s;aac;</HI> and therein was a Type of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, <HI>Gen.</HI> 24. 14, &amp;c. See to it that you thus entertain the Steward of the Hou&s;e of God that comes on this ble&s;&s;ed Errand to you.</P>
<P>If you and your Mini&s;ter thus live in Peace, it will be the Way for you to be a happy Society, to flouri&s;h and pro&s;per with all Manner of Pro&s;perity, to have Chri&s;t dwelling among you; and for Things to be brought to &s;o ble&s;&s;ed an Event at la&s;t, as that he that is the great Shepherd of the Sheep, that purcha&s;ed the Souls of Men with his Blood, and your Pa&s;tor that has the Care of your Souls committed to him, and your &s;elves and Children, all &s;hould rejoice together in another World, agreeable to John 4. 36. <HI>And he that reapeth receiveth Wages, and gathereth Fruit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">; that both he that &s;eweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</HI></P>
