<HEAD>A PRAYER.</HEAD>
<P>O MOST Mighty God, terrible in thy judg|ments, and wonderful in thy doings towards the children of men! We thy &s;inful &s;ervants here a&s;&s;em|bled before thee, confe&s;s, and adore the my&s;terious &s;trokes of thy &s;upreme Providence.</P>
<P>LONG has the land rejoiced in the abundant ema|nation of thy tender mercies. Not our merit but thy goodne&s;s, has turned the wilderne&s;s into fruitful fields, and the lone&s;ome &s;olitude into the cheerful dwellings of men. From year to year, almo&s;t from day to day, new habitations have &s;prung up, which ought to re&s;ound with the prai&s;e of thy holy name, of thy eternal and uncreated &s;on, and of thy mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit.</P>
<P>BUT alas with grief and &s;hame we acknowledge, that we have not always made a right u&s;e of thy continued favours. Not according to thy benefits have been our improvements, not according to thy bounty has been our gratitude. Our hearts &s;mite us when we reflect on the many in&s;tances of our neglect of heavenly, and our attachment to earthly things. Creation and all its ble&s;&s;ings, redemption and all its

graces have but too frequently elap&s;ed from our me|mories; and whil&s;t we have been anxiou&s;ly attentive to the life that now is, we have been fooli&s;hly inat|tentive to the promi&s;e of the life to come. We &s;ee, we feel, we own our&s;elves unworthy of the lea&s;t of thy gracious vouch&s;afements; whereby as a &s;tate we have been gradually led from weakne&s;s to &s;trength, as individuals from lonely helple&s;&s;ne&s;s to all the nu|merous comforts of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>HENCE doubtle&s;s it is; &s;o it becomes us to believe, and &s;o confe&s;s, that thou ha&s;t permitted the bright|ne&s;s of our pro&s;pect to be overclouded, hence, for without thy &s;overeign will nothing can take effect, the dreadful flame of di&s;cord has been kindled, and the devouring &s;word of war un&s;heathed: Hence, we are wounded in the tendere&s;t part, are at variance with tho&s;e whom hitherto we have revered as fathers, ho|noured as teachers, loved as brethren, and dealt with as friends. <HI>For it is not an open enemy that has done us this di&s;honour, neither is it an adver&s;ary that has magnified him&s;elf again&s;t us; but it is even our brother, our guide, and familiar friend, with whom we took &s;weet council, and in the mo&s;t amicable intercour&s;e, walked together in the hou&s;e of God.</HI></P>
<P>IN this &s;evere di&s;tre&s;s whither &s;hall we fly but to thy pre&s;ence? As a religious &s;ociety, prayer is our

only weapon: O may it prove the prayer of the hum|ble, may it pierce through the clouds, reach the foot|&s;teps of thy Almighty throne, and not turn away till thou, O mo&s;t high, regarde&s;t it! St. Paul, the cho|&s;en ve&s;&s;el of thy &s;on, our &s;aviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, has taught us to make prayer and &s;upplications for all men&mdash;for Kings, and for all that are in eminent place&punc; that they, exerci&s;ing their authority with righteou&s;|ne&s;s and ju&s;tice, we may lead a peaceable life in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty, urged therefore alike by our duty, our inclination, and our nece&s;&s;ity, we meekly and devoutly implore thee in behalf of George thy &s;ervant, our King, and Governor, that wi&s;dom de|&s;cending from above may inform his &s;oul, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">late his thoughts, words, and actions; that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ing upon him&s;elf as the common father and protector of all his &s;ubjects, he may cheri&s;h them all without di&s;|tinction, watch over them for their good, and endea|vour to pre&s;erve them in wealth, peace and happi|ne&s;s: and more particularly becau&s;e it is our more immediate concern; that he may extend his care and regard to the inhabitants of this land and province &mdash; may know, and accept, and rejoice in their loyalty and dutiful affection&mdash;may be always ready to hear their complaints, and redre&s;s their &s;ufferings&punc; that &s;o, happy in the felicity of his people, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by a life of goodne&s;s here, he may reign over us honoured and beloved, till it &s;hall be thy plea&s;ure

to remove him to a life of glory hereafter. We al&s;o pray thee for the rulers of this our country, that thou would&s;t give them righteous and under&s;tanding hearts, that wi&s;dom and gentlene&s;s, fortitude and moderati|on may equally animate their councils and actions, that in the pre&s;ent dangerous cri&s;is of affairs, they may leave nothing undone that appertains to our &s;afe|ty and welfare, nor do any thing from a principle of ambition, vain-glory, or &s;elf intere&s;t, that in the mid&s;t of war they may remember peace, and in the very moment of oppo&s;ition, wi&s;h, long, pant, for a &s;afe, happy, and honourable accommodation.</P>
<P>O GRACIOUS God who alone make&s;t men to be of one mind in a hou&s;e, a city, a kingdom, a continent, and even a whole world, &s;uffer not, in the &s;incerity of our hearts, and bitterne&s;s of our &s;ouls we be&s;eech thee, &s;uffer not tho&s;e to remain long divided, whom the &s;ame language, the &s;ame de&s;cent, the &s;ame man|ners, the &s;ame con&s;titution, the &s;ame religion, have &s;o intimately united. We confe&s;s that we are &s;ever|ed for our mutual &s;ins, but do thou mo&s;t gracious fa|ther, re-unite us for thy mercy's &s;ake. A terrible mi&s;conception is gone forth, remove it, O remove it, thou, who&s;e conceptions are clearer than light, and who alone can'&s;t regulate the wills and affections of &s;inful men. We humble our&s;elves under thy correct|ing hand, and confe&s;s the ju&s;tice of all thy judgments,

but we pray, we are allowed to pray, that the dura|tion of our puni&s;hment may be &s;hortened, and our tribula|tions come to an end. We pray for millions now un|der affliction, and for millions yet unborn in both coun|tries, who without thy interpo&s;ing favour, will hereafter be affected by the con&s;equence of the pre&s;ent calamities, yet not on our&s;elves but on thee do we re|ly for our deliverance, not on our merits, but on our Saviour's merits do we depend for mercy: Hear us therefore, O Lord, hear thy people who call upon thee, that all the world may know, that thou art our &s;a|viour and mighty deliverer, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P>

<P>BY the covenant which Almighty God was plea&s;ed to enter into with his peo|ple the Jews, an immediate intercour&s;e was e&s;tabli&s;hed between heaven and earth. Each deviation from the divine law was followed by &s;ure pains and penalties; each return to holine&s;s was a certain return to peace and pro&s;perity. The &s;in of individuals never failed to bring upon them the cur&s;e, their repentance always re&s;tored them to the ble&s;|&s;ing. When&s;oever the &s;tate fell from its al|legiance to Jehovah, then &s;traightway came the great, the terrible day of vengeance: No

&s;ooner was the trumpet blown in Zion, the fa&s;t &s;anctified, and the &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly cal|led, no &s;ooner did the Prie&s;ts and Mini&s;ters weep between the porch and the alter, and &s;ay &s;pare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach; no &s;ooner was the act of public humiliation performed, than pub|lic redre&s;s en&s;ued&mdash;the Lord was jealous for his land, and pitied his people, and removed far off them the northern army.</P>
<P>ON this foundation of God's unchangea|ble promi&s;e it is, that King Solomon at the dedication of the temple frames his petition in the ver&s;es preceding the text. His claim&punc; the &s;acred hi&s;torian goes on to inform us, was allowed; and the mo&s;t high by fire from Heaven ratified afre&s;h the covenant.</P>
<P>THE proce&s;s is mo&s;t plain and mo&s;t awful. I&s;rael offended, the God of I&s;rael puni&s;hed with the famine, the pe&s;tilence, or the &s;word: The people con&s;cious of their &s;ins, made &s;olemn prayer and &s;upplication; the Lord &s;aw the &s;incerity of their repentance, and heard from heaven his dwelling place and forgave them.&mdash;What was the con&s;e|quence?

&mdash;Man by correction learned to fear his God, and that holy fear in&s;uring the di|vine protection, he continued to dwell in &s;afety in the land of his fathers.</P>
<P>HAPPY will it be for us, happy will it be for every nation under the &s;un, if due atten|tion is given to this important le&s;&s;on. Were we but all convinced that <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s ex|alteth a kingdom, whil&s;t &s;in is a reproach to any people,</HI> and did we &s;anctify this convicti|on by practice, what a glorious, what a de|lightful &s;cene of things would immediately pre&s;ent it&s;elf to our view! The nations would be bound in a golden chain of amity: None would groan under oppre&s;&s;ion, for no one would dare to oppre&s;s: The haughty inva|der, the cruel &s;poiler, the relentle&s;s de&s;troy|er, would be terms no more made u&s;e of: And each man &s;itting in &s;afety under his own vine, and under his own fig tree would rapturou&s;ly exclaim,&mdash;Lo this is the true, the genuine reign of Chri&s;t upon earth! Be|hold, the kingdoms of this world are be|come, not in name, but in deed, not in ap|pearance, but in reality, the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="013828_0010_0F91B243238867B0">BUT the multiplied provocations of the &s;ons of men forbid us to indulge the lea&s;t ex|pectation of &s;o plea&s;ing a pro&s;pect. The beautious vi&s;ion &s;hifts away from before our eyes, and in a moment we return to the real unhappy &s;tate of things, a world of di&s;cord and lamentation, of violence and woe, where the long forbearance of the Almighty is much more con&s;picuous than his judgments &mdash;Where it is more rea&s;onable to a&s;k, why cities and &s;tates are permited to &s;tand, than why they are de&s;troyed&mdash;where the abomi|nations of Canaan, and even of Sodom and Gomorrah, are frequent in &s;ome communi|ties&mdash;and where in the be&s;t and mo&s;t virtu|ous congregations, the preacher has &s;till to cry aloud with &s;olemn and uncea&s;ing voice, &mdash;except ye repent ye mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h.</P>

<P>THE pre&s;ent &s;ituation is the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s|ful that could have happened to beings en|dued with humanity. It is more replete with angui&s;h, than even with danger. I have heard, and can well believe, that the oppo|&s;ing armies re&s;pect and pity each other in the

Much, too much, does our ca&s;e re&s;emble that recorded in &s;cripture where King Rehoboam a&s;&s;embled the hou&s;e of Ju|dah, with the tribe of Benjamin to fight again&s;t the hou&s;e of I&s;rael: But alas! alas! there is no Prophet, no Shemiah the man of God, to &s;peak unto <HI>Rehoboam and to all the hou&s;e of Judah and Benjamin, &s;aying, ye &s;hall not go up, nor fight again&s;t your brethren the hou&s;e of I&s;rael; return ye every man to his hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>BUT my duty in this &s;acred place leads me no farther than to bewail the mi&s;eries brought upon this country by tho&s;e fatal mi&s;conceptions that have gone forth on the other &s;ide of the atlantick, and to exhort my little flock, &s;o to prepare them&s;elves by un|feigned faith, by holy prayer, and by genu|ine repentance to de&s;erve (if man can be &s;aid to de&s;erve) the temporal ble&s;&s;ings of the Al|mighty,
