<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the &s;ub&s;equent letters were written by a tender father, in a declining &s;tate of health, for the in&s;truction of his daughters, and not intended for the public, is a circum&s;tance which will recommend them to every one who con&s;iders them in the light of admonition and advice. In &s;uch dome&s;tic intercour&s;e, no &s;acrifices are made to prejudices, to cu&s;toms, to fa&s;hionable opin|ions. Paternal love, paternal care, &s;peak their genuine &s;entiments, undi&s;gui&s;ed and unre&s;trained. A father's zeal for his daugh|ters' improvement, in whatever can make a woman amiable, with a father's quick apprehen&s;ion of the dangers that too often a|ri&s;e, even from the attainment of that very point &s;ugge&s;t his admonitions, and render him attentive to a thou&s;and little graces and lit|tle <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> which would e&s;cape the nice&s;t
<PB N="iv" REF="030515_0003_0FE700EF1EA98878">
morali&s;t who &s;hould undertake the &s;ubject on unintere&s;ted &s;peculation. Every faculty is on the alarm, when the objects of &s;uch ten|der affection are concerned.</P>
<P>In the writer of the&s;e letters paternal ten|derne&s;s and vigilance were doubled, as he was at that time &s;ole parent, death having before deprived the young ladies of their excellent mother. His own precarious &s;tate of health in&s;pired him with the mo&s;t tender &s;olicitude for their future welfare; and though he might have concluded that the im|pre&s;&s;ion made by his in&s;truction and uniform example could never be effaced from the memory of his children, yet his anxiety for their orphan condition &s;ugge&s;ted to him this method of continuing to them tho&s;e advant|ages.</P>
<P>The Editor is encouraged to offer this treati&s;e to the public, by the very favourable reception which the re&s;t of his father's works have met with. The comparative view of the &s;tate of man and other animals,
<PB N="v" REF="030515_0004_0FE700F88DCB4FA0">
and the e&s;&s;ay on the office and duties of a phy&s;ician, have been very generally read; and, if he is not deceived by the partiality of his friends, he has rea&s;on to believe they have met with general approbation.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of tho&s;e tracts the author's object was to improve the ta&s;te and under&s;tanding of his reader; in others, to mend his heart; in others to point out to him the proper u&s;e of philo&s;ophy, by &s;hewing its application to the duties of common life. In all his writ|ings his chief view was the good of his fel|low creatures; and as tho&s;e among his friends, in who&s;e ta&s;te and judgment he mo&s;t confided, think the publication of this work will contribute to that general de&s;ign, and at the &s;ame time do honor to his memory, the editor can no longer he&s;itate to comply with their advice in communicating it to the pub|lic.</P>

<HEAD>A FATHER's LEGACY TO HIS DAUGHTERS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR GIRLS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU had the misfortune to be deprived of your mother, at a time of life when you were in&s;en&s;i|ble of your lo&s;s, and could receive little benefit, either from her in&s;truc|tion, or her example. Before this comes to your hands, you will like|wi&s;e have lo&s;t your father.</P>
<P>I HAVE had many melancholy re|flections on the forlorn and helple&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="030515_0007_0FE700F992528188">
&s;ituation you mu&s;t be in, if it &s;hould plea&s;e God to remove me from you, before you arrive at that period of life, when you will be able to think and act for your&s;elves. I know mankind too well. I know their fal&s;ehoods, their di&s;&s;ipations, their coldne&s;s to all the duties of friend|&s;hip and humanity. I know the little attention paid to helple&s;s in|fancy. You will meet with few friends di&s;intere&s;ted enough to do you good offices, when you are in|capable of making them any return, by contributing to their intere&s;t, or their plea&s;ure, or even to the grati|fication of their vanity.</P>
<P>I HAVE been &s;upported. under the gloom naturally ari&s;ing from the&s;e reflections, by a reliance on the goodne&s;s of that providence which hath hitherto pre&s;erved you, and given me the mo&s;t plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of the goodne&s;s of your di&s;po&s;itions; and by the &s;ecret hope that your mother's virtues will entail a ble&s;&s;|ing on her children.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="030515_0008_0FE700FEB13E52C0">THE anxiety I have for your hap|pine&s;s has made me re&s;olve to throw together my &s;entiments relating to your future conduct in life. If I live for &s;ome years, you will receive them with much greater advantage, &s;uited to your different geniu&s;es and di&s;po&s;itions. If I die &s;ooner, you mu&s;t receive them in this very im|perfect manner&mdash;the la&s;t proof of my affection.</P>
<P>YOU will all remember your fa|ther's fondne&s;s, when perhaps eve|ry other circum&s;tance relating to him is forgotten; this remembrance, I hope, will induce you to give a &s;erious attention to the advices I am now going to leave you. I can reque&s;t this attention with the great|er confidence, as my &s;entiments on the mo&s;t intere&s;ting points that re|gard life and manners, were entire|ly corre&s;pondent to your mother's, who&s;e judgment and ta&s;te I tru&s;ted much more than my own.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t expect that the advices which I &s;hall give you will be very
<PB N="12" REF="030515_0009_0FE700FEB30BA468">
imperfect, as there are many name|le&s;s delicacies, in female manners, of which none but a woman can judge&mdash;You will have one advant|age by attending to what I am going to leave with you; you will hear, at lea&s;t for once in your lives, the genuine &s;entiments of a man who has no intere&s;t in flattering or deceiv|ing you. I &s;hall throw my reflect|ions together, without any &s;tudied order, and &s;hall only, to avoid con|fu&s;ion, range them under a few gen|eral heads.</P>
<P>YOU will &s;ee, in a little treati&s;e of mine ju&s;t publi&s;hed, in what an honorable point of view I have con|&s;idered your &s;ex; not as dome&s;tic drudges, or the &s;laves of our plea&s;|ures, but as our companions and equals; as de&s;igned to &s;often our hearts and poli&s;h our manners; and as Thomp&s;on finely &s;ays,

<P><PB N="13" REF="030515_0010_0FE7010166A4EDD8">I SHALL not repeat what I have there &s;aid on this &s;ubject, and &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that from the view I have given of your natural character and place in &s;ociety, there ari&s;es a certain propriety of conduct pecu|liar to your &s;ex. It is this peculiar propriety of manners of which I in|tend to give you my &s;entiments, without touching on the&s;e general rules of conduct, by which men and women are equally bound.</P>
<P>WHILE I explain to you that &s;y&s;|tem of conduct which I think will tend mo&s;t to your honour and hap|pine&s;s, I &s;hall, at the &s;ame time, endeavour to point out tho&s;e vir|tues and accompli&s;hments which render you mo&s;t re&s;pectable and mo&s;t amiable in the eyes of my own &s;ex.</P>

<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the duties of religion, &s;trictly &s;peaking, are equal|ly binding on both &s;exes, yet certain differences, in their natural charac|ter and education, render &s;ome vices in your &s;ex particularly odious. The natural hardne&s;s of our hearts, and &s;trength of our pa&s;&s;ions inflam|ed by the uncontrouled licen&s;e we are too often indulged with in our youth, are apt to render our man|ners di&s;&s;olute, and make us le&s;s &s;u&s;|ceptible of the finer feelings of the heart. Your &s;uperior delicacy, your mode&s;ty, and the u&s;ual &s;everity of your education, pre&s;erve you in a mea&s;ure from any temptation to tho&s;e vices to which we are mo&s;t &s;ubjected. The natural &s;oftne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility of your di&s;po&s;itions par|ticularly fit you for the practice of tho&s;e duties where the heart is chief|ly
<PB N="15" REF="030515_0012_0FE7010B6DBBEE78">
concerned. And this along with the natural warmth of your imagin|ation, renders you peculiarly &s;u&s;|ceptible to the feelings of devotion.</P>
<P>THERE are many circum&s;tances in your &s;ituation that peculiarly re|quire the &s;upport of religion to en|able you to act in them with &s;pirit and propriety. Your whole life is often a life of &s;uffering. You can|not plunge into bu&s;ine&s;s, or di&s;&s;ipate your&s;elf in plea&s;ure and riot, as men too often do, when under the pre&s;|&s;ure of misfortunes. You mu&s;t bear your &s;orrows in &s;ilence, un|known and unpitied. You mu&s;t often put on a face of &s;erenity and cheerfulne&s;s, when your hearts are torn with angui&s;h, or &s;inking in de|&s;pair. Then your only re&s;ource is in the con&s;olations of religion. It is chiefly owing to the&s;e, that you bear dome&s;tic misfortunes better than we do.</P>
<P>BUT you are &s;ometimes in very different circum&s;tances, that equal|ly require the re&s;traints of religion.
<PB N="16" REF="030515_0013_0FE7010B6F5F9428">
The natural vivacity, and perhaps the natural vanity of your &s;ex, is very apt to lead you into a di&s;&s;ipat|ed &s;tate of life that deceives you, under the appearance of innocent plea&s;ure, but which in reality wa&s;tes your &s;pirits, impairs your health, weakens all the &s;uperior faculties of your minds, and often &s;ullies your reputations. Religion, by checking this di&s;&s;ipation and rage for plea&s;|ure, enables you to draw more happine&s;s, even from tho&s;e very &s;ources of amu&s;ement, which, when too frequently applied to, are often productive of &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>RELIGION is rather a matter of &s;entiment than rea&s;oning. The im|portant and intere&s;ting articles of faith are &s;ufficiently plain. Fix your attention on the&s;e, and do not meddle with controver&s;y. If you get into that, you plunge into a chaos, from which you will never be able to extricate your&s;elves. It &s;poils the temper, and I &s;u&s;pect, has no good effect on the heart.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030515_0014_0FE7010C729C0A18">AVOID all books, and all conver|&s;ation, that tend to &s;hake your faith on tho&s;e great points of religion which &s;hould &s;erve to regulate your conduct, and on which your hopes of future and eternal happine&s;s de|pend.</P>
<P>NEVER indulge your&s;elves in rid|icule on religious &s;ubjects; nor give countenance to it in others, by &s;eeming diverted with what they &s;ay. This, to people of good breeding, will be a &s;ufficient check.</P>
<P>I WISH you to go no farther than the &s;criptures for your religious opinions. Embrace tho&s;e you find clearly revealed. Never perplex your&s;elves about &s;uch as you do not under&s;tand, but treat them with &s;ilent and becoming reverence. I would advi&s;e you to read only &s;uch religious books as are addre&s;&s;ed to the heart, &s;uch as in&s;pire pious and devout affections, &s;uch as are prop|er to direct you in your conduct, and not &s;uch as tend to entangle
<PB N="18" REF="030515_0015_0FE7010C74B243D0">
you in the endle&s;s maze of opinions and &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>BE punctual in the &s;tated per|formance of your private devotions, morning and evening. If you have any &s;en&s;ibility or imagination, this will e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch an intercour&s;e between you and the &s;upreme Be|ing, as will be of infinite con&s;e|quence to you in life. It will com|municate an habitual cheerfulne&s;s to your tempers, give a firmne&s;s and &s;teadine&s;s to your virtue, and enable you to go through all the vici&s;&s;itudes of human life with pro|priety and dignity.</P>
<P>I WISH you to be regular in your attendance on public wor&s;hip, and in receiving the communion. Al|low nothing to interupt your public or private devotions, except the per|formance of &s;ome active duty in life, to which they &s;hould always give place. In your behaviour at public wor&s;hip, ob&s;erve an exem|plary attention and gravity.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="030515_0016_0FE701146CE2E7E0">THAT extreme &s;trictne&s;s which I recommend to you in the&s;e duties, will be con&s;idered by many of your acquaintance as a &s;uper&s;titious at|tachment to forms; but in the ad|vices I give you on this and other &s;ubjects, I have an eye to the &s;pirit and manners of the age. There is a levity and di&s;&s;ipation in the pre&s;|ent manners, a coldne&s;s and li&s;tle&s;&s;|ne&s;s in whatever relates to religion, which cannot fail to infect you, un|le&s;s you purpo&s;ely cultivate in your minds a contrary bias, and make the devotional ta&s;te habitual.</P>
<P>AVOID all grimace and o&s;tenta|tion in your religious duties. They are the u&s;ual cloaks of hypocri&s;y; at lea&s;t they &s;hew a weak and vain mind.</P>
<P>DO not make religion a &s;ubject of common conver&s;ation in mixed companies. When it is introduced, rather &s;eem to decline it. At the &s;ame time, never &s;uffer any per&s;on to in&s;ult you by any fooli&s;h ribald|ry on your religious opinions, but
<PB N="20" REF="030515_0017_0FE701146F7DAF30">
&s;hew the &s;ame re&s;entment you would naturally do on being offered any other per&s;onal in&s;ult.&mdash;But the &s;ur|e&s;t way to avoid this, is by a mod|e&s;t re&s;erve on the &s;ubject, and by u&s;ing no freedom with others about their religious &s;entiments.</P>
<P>CULTIVATE an enlarged charity for all mankind, however they may differ from you in their religious opinions. That difference may probably ari&s;e from cau&s;es in which you had no &s;hare, and from which you can derive no merit.</P>
<P>SHEW your regard to religion, by a di&s;tingui&s;hed re&s;pect to all its mini&s;ters, of whatever per&s;ua&s;ion, who do not by their lives di&s;honor their profe&s;&s;ion; but never allow them the direction of your con&s;cien|ces, le&s;t they taint you with the narrow &s;pirit of their party.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t effect of your religion will be a diffu&s;ive humanity to all in di&s;tre&s;s. Set apart a certain pro|portion of your income as &s;acred to charitable purpo&s;es. But in this,
<PB N="21" REF="030515_0018_0FE70115750D7778">
as well as in the practice of every other duty, carefully avoid o&s;tenta|tion. Vanity is always defeating her own purpo&s;es. Fame is one of the natural rewards of virtue. Do not pur&s;ue her, and &s;he will follow you.</P>
<P>DO not confine your charity to giving money. You may have ma|ny opportunities of &s;hewing a ten|der and compa&s;&s;ionate &s;pirit where your money is not wanted. There is a fal&s;e and unnatural refinement in &s;en&s;ibility, which makes &s;ome people &s;hun the &s;ight of every object in di&s;tre&s;s. Never indulge this, e&s;pecially where your friends or ac|quaintance are concerned. Let the days of their misfortunes, when the world forgets or avoids them, be the &s;ea&s;on for you to exerci&s;e your hu|manity and friend&s;hip. The &s;ight of human mi&s;ery &s;oftens the heart, and makes it better; it checks the pride of health and pro&s;perity, and the di&s;tre&s;s it occa&s;ions is amply compen&s;ated by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="22" REF="030515_0019_0FE7011577344748">
of doing your duty, and by the &s;e|cret endearment which nature has annexed to all our &s;ympathetic &s;or|rows.</P>
<P>WOMEN are greatly deceived, when they think they recommend them&s;elves to our &s;ex by their in|difference about religion. Even the&s;e men who are them&s;elves unbe|lievers, di&s;like infidelity in you. Every man who knows human na|ture, connects a religious ta&s;te in your &s;ex with &s;oftne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibili|ty of heart; at lea&s;t we always con|&s;ider the want of it as a proof of that hard and ma&s;culine &s;pirit, which of all your faults we di&s;like the mo&s;t. Be&s;ides, men con&s;ider your religion as one of their princi|pal &s;ecurities for that female virtue in which they are mo&s;t intere&s;ted. If a gentleman pretends an attach|ment to any of you, and endeav|ours to &s;hake your religious princi|ples, be a&s;&s;ured he is either a fool, or has de&s;igns on you which he dares not openly avow.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="030515_0020_0FE7011C18887CB0">YOU will probably wonder at my having educated you in a church different from my own. The rea|&s;on was plainly this; I looked on the difference between our churches to be of no real importance, and that the preference of one to the other was a mere matter of ta&s;te. Your mother was educated in the church of England, and had an at|tachment to it, and I had a preju|dice in favour of every thing &s;he lik|ed. It never was her de&s;ire that you &s;hould be bapti&s;ed by a clergyman of the church of England, or be ed|ucated in that church. On the contrary, the delicacy of her regard to the &s;malle&s;t circum&s;tance that could affect me in the eye of the world, made her anxiou&s;ly in&s;i&s;t it might be otherways. But I could not yield to her in that kind of gen|ero&s;ity. When I lo&s;t her, I became &s;till more determined to educate you in the church, as I feel a &s;ecret plea|&s;ure in doing every thing that ap|pears to me to expre&s;s my &s;atisfac|tion

<HEAD>CONDUCT AND BEHAVIOR.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the chief beauties in a female character, is that mode&s;t re&s;erve, that retiring delicacy, which avoids the public eye, and is di&s;|concerted even at the gaze of admi|ration. I do not wi&s;h you to be in|&s;en&s;ible to applau&s;e. If you were, you mu&s;t become, if not wor&s;e, at lea&s;t le&s;s amiable women. But you may avoid being dazzled by that admiration, which yet rejoices your hearts.</P>
<P>WHEN a girl cea&s;es to blu&s;h, &s;he has lo&s;t the mo&s;t powerful charm of beauty. That extreme &s;en&s;ibil|ity which it indicates, may be a weakne&s;s and incumbrance in our &s;ex, as I have too often felt; but in yours it is peculiarly engaging. Pedants who think them&s;elves phi|lo&s;ophers,
<PB N="26" REF="030515_0023_0FE700CB0C584358">
a&s;k why a woman &s;hould blu&s;h when &s;he is con&s;cious of no crime? It is a &s;ufficient an&s;wer. that Nature has made you to blu&s;h when you are guilty of no fault, and has forced us to love you be|cau&s;e you do &s;o. Blu&s;hing is &s;o far from being nece&s;&s;arily an attendant on guilt, that it is the u&s;ual com|panion of innocence.</P>
<P>THIS mode&s;ty, which I think &s;o e&s;&s;ential in your &s;ex, will naturally di&s;po&s;e you to be rather &s;ilent in company, e&s;pecially in a large one. People of &s;en&s;e and di&s;cernment will never mi&s;take &s;uch &s;ilence for dulne&s;s. One may take a &s;hare in conver&s;ation without uttering a &s;yl|lable. The expre&s;&s;ion in the coun|tenance &s;hews it, and this never e&s;|capes an ob&s;erving eye.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad that you had an ea&s;y dignity in your behavior at public places, but not that confi|dent ea&s;e, that unba&s;hed counte|nance, which &s;eem to &s;et the com|pany at defiance. If, while a gen|tleman
<PB N="27" REF="030515_0024_0FE7011FB4093A60">
is &s;peaking to you, one of &s;uperior rank addre&s;&s;es you, do not let your eager attention and vi&s;ible preference betray the flutter of your heart. Let your pride upon this occa&s;ion pre&s;erve you from that meanne&s;s into which your vanity would &s;ink you. Con&s;ider that you expo&s;e your&s;elves to the ridicule of the company, and affront one gen|tleman only to &s;well the triumph of another, who perhaps thinks he does you an honour in &s;peaking to you.</P>
<P>CONVERSE with men even of the fir&s;t rank with that dignified mod|e&s;ty which may prevent the ap|proach of the mo&s;t di&s;tant famili|arity, and con&s;equently prevent them from feeling them&s;elves your &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>WIT is the mo&s;t dangerous talent you can po&s;&s;e&s;s. It mu&s;t be guard|ed with great di&s;cretion and good nature, otherwi&s;e it will create you many enemies. Wit is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with &s;oftne&s;s and delica+cy;
<PB N="28" REF="030515_0025_0FE70126C72164C8">
yet they are &s;eldom found unit|ed. Wit is &s;o flattering to vanity, that they who po&s;&s;e&s;s it become in|toxicated and lo&s;e all &s;elf command.</P>
<P>HUMOUR is a different quality&mdash; It will make your company much &s;olicited; but be cautious how you indulge it. It is a great enemy to delicacy, and &s;till a greater one to dignity of a character. It may &s;ome|times gain you applau&s;e, but will never procure you re&s;pect.</P>
<P>BE even cautious in di&s;playing your good &s;en&s;e. It will be thought you a&s;&s;ume a &s;uperiority over the re&s;t of the company. But if you happen to have any learning, keep it a profound &s;ecret, e&s;pecially from the men, who generally look with a jealous and malignant eye on a woman of great parts, and a culti|vated under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>A MAN of real genius and can|dour is far &s;uperior to this mean|ne&s;s. But &s;uch a one will &s;eldom fall in your way&punc; and if by acci|dent he &s;hould, do not be anxious

to &s;hew the full extent of your knowledge. If he has any oppor|tunities of &s;eeing you, he will &s;oon di&s;cover it him&s;elf; and if you have any advantages of per&s;on or manner, and keep your own &s;ecret, he will probably give you credit for a great deal more than you po&s;&s;e&s;s. The great art of plea&s;ing in con|ver&s;ation con&s;i&s;ts in making the company plea&s;ed with them&s;elves. You will more readily hear them talk your&s;elves into their good graces.</P>
<P>BEWARE of detraction, e&s;pecially where your own &s;ex are concerned. You are generally accu&s;ed of be|ing particularly addicted to this vice; I think unju&s;tly. Men are full as guilty of it when their inter|e&s;ts interfere. As your intere&s;ts more frequently cla&s;h, and as your feelings are quicker than ours, your temptations to it are more frequent. For this rea&s;on, be particularly ten|der of the reputation of your own &s;ex, e&s;pecially when they happen
<PB N="30" REF="030515_0027_0FE701ED04F30760">
to rival you in our regards. We look on this as the &s;tronge&s;t proof of dignity and true greatne&s;s of mind.</P>
<P>SHEW a compa&s;&s;ionate &s;ympathy to unfortunate women, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who are rendered &s;o by the villany of men. Indulge a &s;ecret plea&s;ure, I may &s;ay pride, in being the friends and refuge of the un|happy, but without the vanity of &s;hewing it.</P>
<P>CONSIDER every &s;pecies of indel|icacy in conver&s;ation as &s;hameful in it&s;elf, and as highly di&s;gu&s;ting to us. All double entendre is of this &s;ort.&mdash;The di&s;&s;olution of men's ed|ucation allows them to be divert|ed with a kind of wit, which yet they have delicacy enough to be &s;hocked at, when it comes from your mouths, or even when you hear it without pain and contempt. Virgin purity is of that delicate na|ture, that it cannot hear certain things without contamination. It is always in your power to avoid
<PB N="31" REF="030515_0028_0FE7012D040D8190">
the&s;e. No man, but a brute, or a fool would in&s;ult a woman with conver&s;ation which he &s;ees gives her pain; nor will he dare to do it, if &s;he re&s;ent the injury with a becom|ing &s;pirit. There is a dignity in con&s;cious virtue which is able to awe the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s and aban|doned of men.</P>
<P>YOU will be reproached perhaps with prudery. By prudery is gen|erally meant an affectation of deli|cacy. Now I do not wi&s;h you to affect delicacy, I wi&s;h you to po&s;&s;e&s;s it. At any rate it is better to run the ri&s;k of being thought ridiculous than di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>THE men will complain of your re&s;erve. They will a&s;&s;ure you that a franker behavior would make you more amiable. But tru&s;t me, they are not &s;incere, when they tell you &s;o. I acknowledge, that on &s;ome occa&s;ions it might render you more agreeable as companions, but it would make you le&s;s amiable as women: An important di&s;tinction,
<PB N="32" REF="030515_0029_0FE7012D05A11DC8">
which many of your &s;ex are not aware of. After all, I wi&s;h you to have great ea&s;e and openne&s;s in your conver&s;ation. I only point out &s;ome con&s;iderations which ought to regulate your behavior in that re&s;pect.</P>
<P>HAVE a &s;acred regard to truth: Lying is a mean and de&s;picable vice. I have known &s;ome women of ex|cellent parts, who were &s;o much addicted to it, that they could not be tru&s;ted in the relation of any &s;to|ry, e&s;pecially if it contained any thing of the marvellous, or if they them&s;elves were the heroines of the tale. This weakne&s;s did not pro|ceed from a bad heart, but was merely the effect of vanity, or an unbridled imagination. I do not mean to cen&s;ure that lively embel|i&s;hment of a humorous &s;tory which is only intended to promote inno|cent mirth.</P>
<P>THERE is a certain gentlene&s;s of &s;pirit and manners extremely engag|ing in your &s;ex; not that indi&s;crim|inate
<PB N="33" REF="030515_0030_0FE70131E89F8170">
attention, that unmeaning &s;imper which &s;miles on all alike. This ari&s;es, either from an affecta|tion of &s;oftne&s;s, or from perfect in|&s;ipidity.</P>
<P>THERE is a &s;pecies of refinement in luxury, ju&s;t beginning to prevail among the gentlemen of this coun|try, to which our ladies are yet as great &s;trangers as any women upon earth; I hope, for the honor of the &s;ex, they may ever continue to be &s;o: I mean the luxury of eating. It is a de&s;picable &s;elfi&s;h vice in men, but in your &s;ex, it is beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion indelicate and di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>EVERY one who remembers a few years back, is &s;en&s;ible of a very &s;triking change in the attention and re&s;pect formerly paid by the gentle|men to the ladies. Their drawing rooms are de&s;erted; and after din|ner and &s;upper, the gentlemen are impatient till they retire. How they came to loo&s;e this re&s;pect, which nature and politene&s;s &s;o well
<PB N="34" REF="030515_0031_0FE70131EA680888">
entitled them to, I &s;hall not here particularly enquire. The revolu|tions of manners in any country depend on cau&s;es very various and complicated. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the behavior of the ladies in the la&s;t age was very re&s;erved and &s;tately. It would now be reckoned ridiculous and formal. Whatever it was, it had certainly the effect of making them more re&s;pected.</P>
<P>A FINE woman, like other fine things in nature, has her proper point of view, from which &s;he may be &s;een to mo&s;t advantage. To fix this point, requires great judgment, and an intimate knowledge of the human heart. By the pre&s;ent mode of female manners, the ladies &s;eem to expect that they &s;hall regain their a&s;cendency over us, by the fulle&s;t di&s;play of their per&s;onal charms, by being always in our eye at pub|lic places, by conver&s;ing with us with the &s;ame unre&s;erved freedom as we do with one another; in &s;hort, by re&s;embling us as nearly as they
<PB N="35" REF="030515_0032_0FE70135A11A3288">
po&s;&s;ibly can. But a little time and experience will &s;hew the folly of this expectation and conduct.</P>
<P>THE power of a fine woman over the hearts of men, of men of the fine&s;t parts, is even beyond what &s;he conceives. They are &s;en&s;ible of the plea&s;ing illu&s;ions, but they can|not, nor do they wi&s;h to di&s;&s;olve it. But if &s;he is determined to di&s;pel the charm, it certainly is in her power; &s;he may &s;oon reduce the angel to a very ordinary girl.</P>
<P>THERE is a native dignity in in|genuous mode&s;ty to be expected in your &s;ex, which is your natural protection from the familiarities of the men, and which you &s;hould feel previous to the reflections that it is your intere&s;t to keep your&s;elves &s;acred from all per&s;onal freedoms. The many namele&s;s charms and en|dearments of beauty &s;hould be re|&s;erved to ble&s;s the arms of the hap|py man to whom you give your heart, but who, if he has the lea&s;t delicacy, will de&s;pi&s;e them if he
<PB N="36" REF="030515_0033_0FE70135A2A7E708">
knows that they have been pro&s;ti|tuted to fifty men before him. The &s;entiment, that a woman may allow all innocent freedoms, provided her virtue is &s;ecure&punc; is both gro&s;sly in|delicate and dangerous, and has proved fatal to many of your &s;ex.</P>
<P>LET me now recommend to your attention that elegance, which is not &s;o much a quality it&s;elf, as the high poli&s;h of every other. It is what diffu&s;es an ineffable grace over every look, every motion, ev|ery &s;entence you utter. It gives that charm to beauty, without which it generally fails to plea&s;e. It is partly a per&s;onal quality, in which re&s;pect, it is the gift of nature; but I &s;peak of it principally as a quali|ty of the mind. In a word, it is the perfection of ta&s;te in life and manners; every virtue and every excellency in their mo&s;t graceful and amiable forms.</P>
<P>YOU may perhaps think that I want to throw every &s;park of nature out of your compo&s;ition, and to
<PB N="37" REF="030515_0034_0FE70139442CE0D0">
make you entirely artificial. Far from it. I wi&s;h you to po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t perfect &s;implicity of heart and manners. I think you may po&s;&s;e&s;s dignity without pride, affability without meanne&s;s, and &s;imple ele|gance without affectation. Milton had my idea, when he &s;ays of Eve,

<HEAD>AMUSEMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY period of life has amu&s;ements which are natural and proper to it. You may indulge the variety of your ta&s;tes in the&s;e, while you keep within the bounds of that propriety which is &s;uitable to your &s;ex.</P>
<P>SOME amu&s;ements are conducive to health, as various kinds of exer|ci&s;e: Some are connected with qualities really u&s;eful, as different kinds of women's work, and all the dome&s;tic concerns of a family; &s;ome are elegant accompli&s;hments, as dre&s;s, dancing, mu&s;ic and drawing. Such books as improve your under|&s;tanding, enlarge your knowledge, and cultivate your ta&s;te, may be con&s;idered in a higher point of view than mere amu&s;ements. There
<PB N="39" REF="030515_0036_0FE7013F77E53058">
are a variety of others, which are neither u&s;eful nor ornamental, &s;uch as play of different kinds.</P>
<P>I WOULD particularly recommend to you tho&s;e exerci&s;es, that oblige you to be much abroad in the open air, &s;uch as walking, and riding on hor&s;eback. This will give vigour to your con&s;titutions and a bloom to your complexions. If you ac|cu&s;tom your&s;elves to go abroad al|ways in chairs and carriages, you will &s;oon become &s;o enervated, as to be unable to go out of doors with|out them.&mdash;They are like mo&s;t ar|ticles of luxury, u&s;eful and agreea|ble when judiciou&s;ly u&s;ed; but when made habitual, they become both in&s;ipid and pernicious.</P>
<P>AN attention to your health is a duty you owe to your&s;elves and to your friends. Bad health &s;eldom fails to have an influence on the &s;pirits and temper. The fine&s;t ge|niu&s;es, the mo&s;t delicate minds, have very frequently a corre&s;pondent del|icacy of bodily con&s;titution, which
<PB N="40" REF="030515_0037_0FE7013F79626248">
they are too apt to neglect. Their luxury lies in reading and late hours, equal enemies to health and beauty.</P>
<P>BUT though good health be one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of life, never boa&s;t of it, but enjoy it in grateful &s;ilence. We &s;o naturally a&s;&s;ociate the idea of female &s;oftne&s;s and deli|cacy, with a corre&s;pondent delicacy of con&s;titution, that when a woman &s;peaks of her great &s;trength, her ex|traordinary appetite, her ability to bear exce&s;&s;ive fatigue, we recoil at the de&s;cription in a way &s;he is little aware of.</P>
<P>THE intention of your being taught needle work, knitting, and &s;uch like, is not on account of the intrin&s;ic value of all you can do with your hands, which is trifling, but to enable you to judge more perfectly of that kind of work, and to direct the execution of it in oth|ers. Another principal end is to enable you to fill up in a tolerable way, &s;ome of the many &s;olitary hours you mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s at
<PB N="41" REF="030515_0038_0FE70141C8EF1FE8">
home. It is a great article in the happine&s;s of life&punc; to have your plea&s;|ures as independent of others as po&s;&s;ible. By continually gadding abroad in &s;earch of amu&s;ement, you lo&s;e the re&s;pect of your acquaint|ances, whom you oppre&s;s with tho&s;e vi&s;its&punc; which, by a more di&s;creet management, might have been courted.</P>
<P>THE dome&s;tic economy of a fam|ily is entirely a woman's province, and furni&s;hes a variety of &s;ubjects for the exertion both of good &s;en&s;e and good ta&s;te. If you ever come to have the charge of a family, it ought to engage much of your time and attention; nor can you be ex|cu&s;ed from this by any extent of fortune, though with a narrow one the ruin that follows the neglect of it may be more immediate.</P>
<P>I AM at the greate&s;t lo&s;s what to advi&s;e you in regard to books; there is no impropriety in your reading hi&s;tory or cultivating any art or &s;ci|ence
<PB N="42" REF="030515_0039_0FE70141CAD3DDA8">
to which genius or accident lead you. The whole volume of Nature lies open to your eye, and furni&s;hes an infinite variety of en|tertainment. If I was &s;ure that Na|ture had given you &s;uch &s;trong principles of ta&s;te and &s;entiment&punc; as would remain with you, and influ|ence your future conduct, with the utmo&s;t plea&s;ure would I endeavour to direct your reading in &s;uch a way as might form that ta&s;te to the ut|mo&s;t perfection of truth and ele|gance&mdash;"But when I reflect how ea&s;y it is to warm a girl's imagina|tion, and how difficult deeply and permanently to affect her heart; how readily &s;he enters into every refinement of &s;entiment, and how ea&s;y &s;he can &s;acrifice them to vanity or convenience; I think I may very probably do you an injury by arti|ficially creating a ta&s;te, which, if Nature never gave it you, would only &s;erve to embarra&s;s your future conduct. I do not want to make you any thing; I want to know
<PB N="43" REF="030515_0040_0FE701486D1876D0">
what Nature has made you, and to perfect you on her plan. I do not wi&s;h you to have &s;entiments that might perplex you: I wi&s;h you to have &s;entiments that may uniformly and &s;teadily guide you, and &s;uch as your hearts &s;o thoroughly approve&punc; that you would not forego them for any con&s;ideration this world may offer.</P>
<P>DRESS is an important article in female life&mdash;The love of dre&s;s is natural to you, and therefore it is proper and rea&s;onable. Good &s;en&s;e will regulate your expen&s;e in it; and good ta&s;te will direct you to dre&s;s in &s;uch a way, as to conceal any blemi&s;hes, and &s;et off your beauties, if you have any, to the greate&s;t advantage. But much del|icacy and judgment are required in the application of this rule. A fine woman &s;hews her charms to mo&s;t advantage, when &s;he &s;eems mo&s;t to conceal them. The fine&s;t bo&s;om in nature is not &s;o fine as what imagination forms. The mo&s;t
<PB N="44" REF="030515_0041_0FE701486E958980">
perfect elegance of dre&s;s appears always the mo&s;t ea&s;y, and the lea&s;t &s;tudied.</P>
<P>DO not confine your attention to dre&s;s&punc; to your public appearance. Accu&s;tom your&s;elves to an habitual neatne&s;s, &s;o that in the mo&s;t carele&s;s undre&s;s, in your mo&s;t unguarded hours, you may have no rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of your appearance. You will not ea&s;ily believe how much we con&s;ider your dre&s;s as ex|pre&s;&s;ive of your characters. Vanity, levity&punc; &s;lovenline&s;s&punc; folly, appear through it. And an elegant &s;im|plicity is an equal proof of ta&s;te and delicacy.</P>
<P>IN dancing&punc; the principal points you are to attend to are ea&s;e and grace. I would have you dance with &s;pirit; but never allow your|&s;elves to be &s;o far tran&s;ported with mirth, as to forget the delicacy of your &s;ex. Many a girl dancing in the gaiety and innocence of her heart, is thought to di&s;cover a &s;pirit &s;he little dreams of.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="030515_0042_0FE7014AC3543410">I KNOW no entertainment that gives &s;uch plea&s;ure to any per&s;on of &s;entiment and humour, as the thea|tre.

Men are often be&s;t acquainted with the mo&s;t worthle&s;s of your &s;ex&punc; and from them too readily form their judgment of the re&s;t.

<P>THE luxury and di&s;&s;ipa|tion that prevails in genteel life, as it corrupts the heart in many re&s;|pects, &s;o it renders it incapable of warm, &s;incere, and &s;teady friend|&s;hip. A happy choice of friends will be of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to you&punc; as they may a&s;&s;i&s;t you by their advice and good offices. But the immediate gratification which friend&s;hip affords to a warm&punc; open, and ingenuous heart, is of it&s;elf a &s;ufficient motive to court it.</P>
<P>IN the choice of your friends, have your principal regard to good|ne&s;s of heart and fidelity. If they al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s ta&s;te and genius, that will &s;till make them more agreeable and u&s;eful companions. You have

particular rea&s;on to place confi|dence in tho&s;e who have &s;hewn af|fection for you in your early days, when you were incapable of mak|ing them any return. This is an obligation for which you cannot be too grateful. When you read this, you will naturally think of your mother's friend, to whom you owe &s;o much.</P>
<P>IF you have the good fortune to meet with any who de&s;erve the name of friends, unbo&s;om your|&s;elves to them with the mo&s;t un&s;u&s;|picious confidence.

An open temper, if re&s;trained by toler|able prudence, will make you, on the whole, much happier than a re|&s;erved, &s;u&s;picious one, although you

<P>IN &s;uch a &s;ituation, to lay the heart open to any per&s;on whatever, does not appear to me con&s;i&s;tent with the perfection of female del|icacy. But perhaps I am wrong. At the &s;ame time I mu&s;t tell you, that in point of prudence it con|cerns you to attend well to the con|&s;equences of &s;uch a di&s;covery. The&s;e &s;ecrets, however important in your own e&s;timation, may appear very trifling to your friend, who po&s;&s;ibly will not enter into your feelings, but may rather con&s;ider them as a &s;ubject of plea&s;antry. for this rea&s;on, love &s;ecrets are of all others the wor&s;t kept. But the con&s;equences to you may be very &s;erious, as no man of &s;pirit and del|icacy ever valued a heart much hackneyed in the ways of love.</P>

There are certain unguarded moments, in which &s;uch a woman, though the be&s;t and wor|thie&s;t of her &s;ex, may let hints e&s;|cape, which at other times, or to any other per&s;on than her hu&s;band, &s;he would be incapable of; nor will a hu&s;band in this ca&s;e feel him&s;elf under the &s;ame obligation of &s;ecrecy and honour, as if you had put your confidence originally in him&s;elf, e&s;pecially on a &s;ubject which the world is apt to treat &s;o lightly.</P>
<P>IF all other circum&s;tances are equal, there are obvious advanta|ges in your making friends of one another.

<P>BEWARE of making confidants of your &s;ervants. Dignity not prop|erly under&s;tood very readily degen|erates into pride, which enters into no friend&s;hips, becau&s;e it cannot bear an equal, and is &s;o fond of flattery as to gra&s;p at it even from &s;ervants and dependants. The mo&s;t intimate confidants, therefore, of proud people, are valets de cham|bre and waiting women. Shew the utmo&s;t humanity to your &s;ervants; make their &s;ituation as comfortable to them as po&s;&s;ible; but if you make them your confidants, you &s;poil them, and deba&s;e your&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="030515_0051_0FE7015D57A1B690">NEVER allow any per&s;on, under the pretended &s;anction of friend&s;hip, to be &s;o familiar as to lo&s;e a prop|er re&s;pect to you. Never allow them to teaze you on any &s;ubject that is di&s;agreeable, or where you have once taken your re&s;olution. Many will tell you, that this re&s;erve is incon&s;i&s;tent with the freedom which friend&s;hip allows. But a certain re&s;pect is as nece&s;&s;ary in friend&s;hip as in love.&mdash;Without it, you may be liked as a child, but you will never be beloved as an e|qual.</P>
<P>THE temper and di&s;po&s;itions of the heart in your &s;ex make you en|ter more readily and warmly into friend&s;hips than men.&mdash;Your natur|al propen&s;ity to it is &s;o &s;trong, that you often run into intimacies which you &s;oon have &s;ufficient cau&s;e to re|pent of; and this makes your friend|&s;hips &s;o very fluctuating.</P>
<P>ANOTHER great ob&s;tacle to the &s;incerity as well as &s;teadine&s;s of your friend&s;hip, is the great cla&s;h|ing

of your intere&s;ts in the pur&s;uits of love, ambition or vanity. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, it would appear at fir&s;t view more eligible for you to contract your friend&s;hips with the men. Among other obvious ad|vantages of an ea&s;y intercour&s;e be|tween the two &s;exes, it occa&s;ions an emulation and exertion in each to excel and be agreeable: Hence their re&s;pective excellences are mutually communicated and blended. As their intere&s;ts in no degree inter|fere, there can be no foundation for jealou&s;y or &s;uper&s;tition of rival|&s;hip. The friend&s;hip of a man for a woman is always blended with a tenderne&s;s, which he never feels for one of his own &s;ex&punc; even where love is in no degree concerned. Be&s;ides, we are con&s;cious of a natural title you have to our protection and good offices, and therefore we feel an additional obligation of honour to &s;erve you, and to ob&s;erve an in|violable &s;ecrecy, whenever you con|fide in us.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="030515_0053_0FE701656D159C58">BUT apply the&s;e ob&s;ervations with great caution.

But &s;uppo&s;ing a man to have the mo&s;t undoubted honour, yet his friend&s;hip to a wo|man is &s;o near akin to love, that if &s;he be very agreeable in her per&s;on, &s;he will probably very &s;oon find a lover, where &s;he only wi&s;hed to meet a friend. Let me here, however, warn you again&s;t that weakne&s;s &s;o common among vain women, the imagination that every man who takes particular notice of them is a lover. Nothing can expo&s;e you more to ridicule than the taking up a man on the &s;u&s;picion of being your lover, who perhaps never once thought of you in that view, and giving your&s;elves tho&s;e airs &s;o com|mon among &s;illy women on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>

men, which, if you have any di&s;|cernment, you will find really very harmle&s;s.

Look on the compliments of &s;uch men, as words of cour&s;e, which they repeat to every agreeable woman of their acquaintance. There is a fa|miliarity they are apt to a&s;&s;ume&punc; which a proper dignity in your be|haviour will be ea&s;ily able to check.</P>
<P>THERE is a different &s;pecies of men, whom you may like as agreea|ble companions, men of worth, ta&s;te, and genius, who&s;e conver&s;a|tion, in &s;ome re&s;pects, may be &s;u|perior to what you generally meet with among your own &s;ex.

<P>PEOPLE, who&s;e &s;entiments, and particularly who&s;e ta&s;tes corre&s;|pond, naturally like to a&s;&s;ociate to|gether, although neither of them have the mo&s;t di&s;tant view of any farther connexion. But as this &s;imilarity of minds often gives ri&s;e to a more tender attachment than friend&s;hip, it will be prudent to keep a watchful eye over your|&s;elves, le&s;t your hearts become too far engaged before you are aware of it. At the &s;ame time, I do not think, that your &s;ex, at lea&s;t in this part of the world, have much of that &s;en&s;ibility which di&s;po&s;es to &s;uch attachments. What is com|monly called love among you, is rather gratitude, and a partiality to the man who prefers you to the re&s;t of your &s;ex, and &s;uch a man you often marry, with little of either per&s;onal e&s;teem or affection. In|deed,

without an unu&s;ual &s;hare of natural &s;en&s;ibility, and very pecu|liar good fortune, a woman in this country has very little probability of marrying for love.</P>
<P>IT is a maxim laid down among you, and a very prudent one it is, that love is not to begin on your part, but is entirely to be the con|&s;equence of our attachment to you. Now, &s;uppo&s;ing a woman to have &s;en&s;e and ta&s;te, &s;he will not find many men to whom &s;he can po&s;&s;i|bly be &s;uppo&s;ed to bear any con&s;id|erable &s;hare of e&s;teem. Among the&s;e few it is a very great chance if any of them di&s;tingui&s;hes her particularly. Love, at lea&s;t with us, is exceedingly capricious, and will not always &s;ix where rea&s;on &s;ays it &s;hould. But &s;uppo&s;ing one of them &s;hould become particularly attached to her, it is extremely im|probable that he &s;hould be the man in the world her heart mo&s;t approv|ed of.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="030515_0057_0FE7016D5170DBE8">AS, therefore, Nature has not giv|en that unlimited range in your choice, which we enjoy, &s;he has wi&s;ely and benevolently a&s;&s;igned to you a greater flexibility of ta&s;te on this &s;ubject. Some agreeable qual|ities recommend a gentleman to your common good liking and friend&s;hip. In the cour&s;e of his ac|quaintance, he contracts an attach|ment to you. When you perceive it, it excites your gratitude; this gratitude ri&s;es into a preference, and this preference perhaps at la&s;t ad|vances to &s;ome degree of attach|ment; e&s;pecially if it meets with cro&s;&s;es and difficulties; for the&s;e, and a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, are very great incitements to attachment, and are the food of love, in both &s;exes. If attachment was not excited in your &s;ex in this manner, there is not one of a million of you that could ever marry with any degree of love.</P>
<P>A MAN of ta&s;te and delicacy mar|ries a woman becau&s;e he loves her
<PB N="61" REF="030515_0058_0FE7016FA5B65F88">
more than any other. A woman of equal ta&s;te and delicacy marries him becau&s;e &s;he e&s;teems him, and becau&s;e he gives her that preference. But if a man unfortunately becomes attached to a woman who&s;e heart is &s;ecretly preengaged, his attach|ment, in&s;tead of obtaining a &s;uita|ble return, is particularly offen&s;ive; and if he per&s;i&s;ts to tea&s;e her, he makes him&s;elf equally the object of her &s;corn and aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE effects of love among men are diver&s;ified by their different tempers. An artful man may counterfeit every one of them &s;o as ea&s;ily to impo&s;e on a young girl, of an open&punc; generous and feeling heart, if &s;he is not extremely on her guard. The fine&s;t parts in &s;uch a girl may not always prove &s;ufficient for her &s;ecurity. The dark and crooked paths of cunning are un&s;earchable and inconceivable to an honourable and elevated mind.</P>
<P>THE following, I apprehend, are the mo&s;t genuine effects of an hon|ourable
<PB N="62" REF="030515_0059_0FE7016FA9EC9EC8">
pa&s;&s;ion among the men, and the mo&s;t difficult to counterfeit. A man of delicacy often betrays his pa&s;&s;ions by his too great anxiety to conceal it, e&s;pecially if he has little hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. True love in all its &s;tages &s;eeks concealment, and never expects &s;ucce&s;s. It renders a man not only re&s;pectful but timid to the highe&s;t degree in his behav|iour to the woman he loves. To conceal the awe he &s;tands in of her, he may &s;ometimes affect plea&s;antry, but it &s;its awkwardly on him, and he quickly relap&s;es into &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, if not into dulne&s;s. He magnifies all her real perfections in his imag|ination, and is either blind to her failings, or converts them into beau|ties. Like a per&s;on con&s;cious of guilt; he is jealous that every eye ob&s;erves him&punc; and to avoid this, he &s;huns all the little ob&s;ervances of common gallantry.</P>
<P>HIS heart and his character will be improved in every re&s;pect by his attachment. His manners will
<PB N="63" REF="030515_0060_0FE701784B5CBCB8">
become more gentle, and his con|ver&s;ation more agreeable; but diffi|dence and embara&s;&s;ment will al|ways make him appear to di&s;ad|vantage in the company of his mi&s;|tre&s;s. If the fa&s;cination continue long, it will totally depre&s;s his &s;pir|its, and extingui&s;h every active, vigorous, and manly principle of his mind. You will find this &s;ub|ject beautifully and pathetically painted in Thomp&s;on's Spring.</P>
<P>WHEN you ob&s;erve in a gentle|man's behavior the&s;e marks which I have de&s;cribed above, reflect &s;eri|ou&s;ly what you are to do. If his attachment is agreeable to you, I leave you to do as nature, good &s;en&s;e, and delicacy &s;hall direct you. If you love him, let me advi&s;e you never to di&s;cover to him the full extent of your love, no not al|though you marry him. That &s;uf|ficiently &s;hews your preference, which is all he is entitled to know. If he has delicacy, he will a&s;k no &s;tronger proof of your affection for

<P>HOWEVER people's hearts may deceive them, there is &s;carcely a per|&s;on that can love for any time with|out at lea&s;t &s;ome di&s;tant hope of &s;ucce&s;s. If you really wi&s;h to un|deceive a lover, you may do it in a
<PB N="65" REF="030515_0062_0FE70179A93B6F68">
variety of ways. There is a certain &s;pecies of ea&s;y familiarity in your behavior, which may &s;atisfy him, if he has any di&s;cernment left, that he has nothing to hope for. But per|haps your particular temper may not admit of this. You may ea&s;ily &s;hew that you want to avoid his company; but if he is a man who&s;e friend&s;hip you wi&s;h to pre&s;erve, you may not choo&s;e this method, be|cau&s;e then you lo&s;e him in every capacity. You may get a common friend to explain matters to him, or fall on many other devices, if you are &s;eriou&s;ly anxious to put him out of &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT if you are re&s;olved again&s;t every &s;uch method, at lea&s;t do not &s;hun opportunities of letting him explain him&s;elf. If you do this, you act barbarou&s;ly and unju&s;tly. If he brings you to an explanation, give him a polite, but a re&s;olute and deci&s;ive an&s;wer. In whatever way you convey your &s;entiments to him,
<PB N="66" REF="030515_0063_0FE70179ADC84E70">
if he is a man of &s;pirit and delica|cy, he will give you no farther trouble, nor apply to your friends for their interce&s;&s;ion. This la&s;t is a method of court&s;hip which every man of &s;pirit will di&s;dain. He will never whine nor &s;ue for your pity. That would mortify him al|mo&s;t as much as your &s;corn. In &s;hort, you may po&s;&s;ibly break &s;uch a heart, but you can never bend it. &mdash;Great pride always accompanies delicate minds, however concealed under the appearance of the utmo&s;t gentlene&s;s and mode&s;ty, and is the pa&s;&s;ion of all others the mo&s;t diffi|cult to conquer.</P>
<P>THERE is a ca&s;e where a woman may coquet ju&s;tifiably to the utmo&s;t verge which her con&s;cience will al|low. It is where a gentleman pur|po&s;ely declines to make his addre&s;&s;|es, till &s;uch time as he thinks him|&s;elf perfectly &s;ure of her con&s;ent. This at the bottom is intended to force a woman to give up the un|doubted privilege of her &s;ex, the

privilege of refu&s;ing; it is intend|ed to force her to explain her&s;elf, in effect, before the gentleman deigns to do it, and by this means oblige her to violate the mode&s;ty and delicacy of her &s;ex, and to in|vert the cleare&s;t order of nature.</P>
<P>ALL this &s;acrifice is propo&s;ed to be made, merely to gratify a mo&s;t de&s;picable vanity, in a man who would degrade the very woman whom he wi&s;hes to make his wife.</P>
<P>IT is of great importance to di&s;|tingui&s;h, whether a gentleman who has the appearance of being your lover, delays to &s;peak explicitly, from the motive I have mentioned, or from a diffidence in&s;eparable from true attachment. In the one ca&s;e you can &s;carcely u&s;e him too ill; in the other you ought to u&s;e him with great kindne&s;s; and the greate&s;t kindne&s;s you can &s;hew him, if you are determined not to li&s;ten to his addre&s;&s;es&punc; is to let him know it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="030515_0065_0FE7018217F41098">I KNOW the many excu&s;es with which women endeavour to ju&s;tify them&s;elves to the world, and to their own con&s;ciences, when they act otherwi&s;e.

Perhaps few women carry their ideas of female delicacy and decorum &s;o far as I do. But I mu&s;t &s;ay you are not entitled to plead the obligation of the&s;e virtues, in oppo&s;ition to the &s;uperior ones of gratitude, ju&s;tice and humanity.

True love is founded on e&s;teem, in a corre&s;pondence of ta&s;tes and &s;en|timents, and &s;teals on the heart im|perceptibly.</P>
<P>THERE is one advice I &s;hall leave you, to which I beg your particu|lar attention. Before your affec|tions come to be in the lea&s;t engag|ed to any man, examine your tem|pers, your ta&s;tes and your hearts, very &s;everely, and &s;ettle in your own minds what are the requi&s;ites to your happine&s;s in a married &s;tate; and as it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould get every thing you wi&s;h, come to a &s;teady determina|tion what you are to con&s;ider as e&s;|&s;ential, and what may be &s;acrificed.</P>
<P>IF you have hearts di&s;po&s;ed by Nature for love and friend&s;hip, and po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e feelings which enable you to enter into all the refinements and delicacies of the&s;e attachments, con&s;ider well, for Heaven's &s;ake, and as you value your future hap|pine&s;s, before you give them any indulgence. If you have the mi&s;|fortune

(for a very great misfortune it commonly is to your &s;ex) to have &s;uch a temper and &s;uch &s;entiments deeply rooted in you&mdash;if you have &s;pirit and re&s;olution to re&s;i&s;t the &s;olicitations of vanity, the per&s;ecu|tions of friends, (for you will have lo&s;t the only friend that would nev|er per&s;ecute you) and can &s;upport the pro&s;pect of the many inconve|niences attending the &s;tate of an old maid, which I formerly pointed out, then you may indulge your&s;elves in that kind of &s;entimental reading and conver&s;ation, which is mo&s;t core&s;pondent to your feelings.</P>
<P>BUT if you find on a &s;trict &s;elf ex|amination, that marriage is ab&s;o|lutely e&s;&s;ential to your happine&s;s, keep the &s;ecret inviolable in your own bo&s;oms, for the rea&s;on I for|merly mentioned; but &s;hun&punc; as you would do the mo&s;t fatal poi&s;on, all that &s;pecies of reading and conver|&s;ation which warms the imagina|tion, which engages and &s;oftens the

<P>IF this refinement once takes deep root in your minds, and you do not obey its dictates, but marry from vulgar and mercenary views, you may never be able to eradicate it entirely, and then it will embitter all your married days.

You will find none to compa&s;&s;ionate, or even under&s;tand your &s;ufferings; for your hu&s;bands may not u&s;e you cruelly, and may give you as much money for your clothes, per&s;onal expen&s;e and dome&s;tic nece&s;&s;aries, as is &s;uitable to their fortunes. The world would therefore look on you as unrea&s;onable women, and who

<P>I HAVE no view by the&s;e advices to lead your ta&s;tes; I only want to per&s;uade you of the nece&s;&s;ity of knowing your own minds, which, though &s;eemingly very ea&s;y, is what your &s;ex &s;eldom attain on many important occa&s;ions in life, but particularly on this of which I am &s;peaking.

<P>IF a gentleman makes his addre&s;&s;|es to you, or gives you rea&s;on to believe he will do &s;o, before you allow your affections to be engaged, endeavour, in the mo&s;t prudent and &s;ecret manner, to procure from your friends every nece&s;&s;ary piece of information concerning him; &s;uch as his character for &s;en&s;e, his morals, his temper, fortune and family; whether it is di&s;tingui&s;hed for parts and worth, or folly knave|ry, and lothe&s;ome hereditary di&s;ea&s;|es.

Do not give way to a &s;udden &s;ally of pa&s;&s;ion, and dignify it with the name of love.&mdash; Genuine love is not founded in ca|price; it is &s;ounded in nature, on honorable views, on virtue, on &s;im|ilarity of ta&s;tes and &s;ympathy of &s;ouls.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="030515_0085_0FE701B18BE7D230">IF you have the&s;e &s;entiments, you will never marry any one, when you are not in that &s;ituation, in point of fortune, which is nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of either of you.</P>

I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that if motives of intere&s;t or vanity have had any &s;hare in your re&s;olutions to marry, none of the&s;e chimerical notions will give you any pain; nay, they will very quickly appear as ridicu|lous in your own eyes, as they prob|ably always did in the eyes of your hu&s;bands.

<P>IT was a memorable practice of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, through the whole cour&s;e of his life; he called him&s;elf to an account every night for the actions of the pa&s;t day, and &s;o often as he found he had &s;kipped any one day without doing &s;ome good, he enter|ed upon his diary this memorial, "<HI>I have lo&s;t a day.</HI>"</P>
<P>THE time we live ought not to be computed by the number of years, but by the u&s;e which has been made of it: It is not the ex|tent of ground, but the yearly rent which gives the value to the e&s;tate. Wretched and thoughtle&s;s creatures!

in the only place where covetou&s;|ne&s;s were a virtue, we turn prodi|gals! nothing lies upon our hands with &s;uch unea&s;ine&s;s, nor has there been &s;o many devices for any one thing, as to make time glide away imperceptibly and to no purpo&s;e. A &s;hilling &s;hall be hoarded up with care whil&s;t that which is above the price of an e&s;tate, is flung away with di&s;regard and contempt.</P>
