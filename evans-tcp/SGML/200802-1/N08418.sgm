<Q><HI>Wi&s;dom is better than Weapons of War</HI>&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE &s;tory, whether real or ficti|tious, which gives ri&s;e to this ob&s;ervation, may be con&s;idered as a &s;pecimen of the temper and conduct of mankind under &s;imilar circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THE &s;upreme governor has put mankind into different &s;ituations in this world; as <HI>the potter hath power over the clay to make one ve&s;&s;el to honor, and another to di&s;honor,</HI> &s;o he to make one being of greater, and another
<PB N="6" REF="010768_0004_0F8178943648A6F8">
of le&s;s capacity, and to place one under grea|ter, and another under le&s;s advantages of improvement. And as it is nece&s;&s;ary to their well-being that mankind &s;hould be formed into different &s;ocieties, the &s;ame &s;overeignty is di&s;played towards them in that &s;ituation; hence one &s;ociety has more wealth and grea|ter &s;trength than another. <HI>There was a little city and few men within it, and there came a great king again&s;t it.</HI> The &s;uperiority of this great king, no doubt lay in numbers and wealth, which are the &s;inews of martial power.</P>
<P>AMBITION and avarice too often ari&s;e from the circum&s;tances of the powerful and great; the &s;ame per&s;ons under different cir|cum&s;tances will act a very different part: The a&s;piring views of men bear &s;ome pro|portion to their fortunes; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of much produces an ardent thir&s;t for more. How &s;trongly &s;oever this &s;peaks the imper|fection of man, and the in&s;ufficiency of worldly good to the happine&s;s for which the human mind was formed, facts abundantly &s;upport the verity of it. Nor is it impro|bable, that &s;uch views led this great king
<PB N="7" REF="010768_0004_0F8178943648A6F8">
again&s;t this little city; for tho' &s;mall, com|pared to his kingdom, yet the conque&s;t might, in his &s;ordid mind, be a de&s;ired augmentation of wealth, and extent of dominion.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t &s;anguine attempts, and big with probability of &s;ucce&s;s may prove abor|tive: <HI>The race is not always to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong.</HI> As the human mind is finite, and therefore incapable to take in every circum&s;tance that may attend the execution of a plan, &s;eemingly laid with the greate&s;t probability of &s;ucce&s;s, &s;o one incident unfore&s;een may terminate the whole in di&s;|appointment. So terminated the de&s;igns of this <HI>great king,</HI> again&s;t this <HI>little city.</HI> A poor man within the walls, too ob&s;cure to be noticed by this great general, by his wi&s;|dom delivered it from his rapacious jaws.</P>
<P>THE e&s;timation of wi&s;dom is to be made from the mind, directing the conduct, and not from outward circum&s;tances. The mind in its own nature, is &s;uperior to mat|ter, as it is capable of noble exertions, and great improvements; and in proportion to the ideas, and ju&s;tne&s;s of &s;entiment it ac|quires,
<PB N="8" REF="010768_0005_0F817894716C3CA8">
determining a corre&s;ponding con|duct, it is le&s;s or more worthy: There is therefore no ab&s;olute connection between outward circum&s;tances, and mental nobili|ty: The <HI>Poor</HI> may be <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> and the Rich fooli&s;h, <HI>for riches are not always to men of under&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>BUT yet mankind in general, &s;uch is their imperfection, are apt to e&s;timate the real cha|racter by outward circum&s;tances: The fal&s;e glare of &s;ecular grandeur pre&s;&s;es &s;o hard upon the feeble &s;ight of the inattentive, as to lead into deception in judging of them&s;elves and others. Riches make men &s;elf-&s;ufficient, and produce in others a &s;ervile dependence on their &s;overeign dictates. Wealth is the &s;tandard of wi&s;dom, as well as the &s;ource of happine&s;s, in the opinion of the unthinking. The idea of poverty and folly are clo&s;ely connected, and outward circum&s;tances are the criterion of a man's real worth. And this is the foible not of a few, but of the greater part of mankind; to the opulent they are attentive and ob&s;equious, but <HI>the poor man's wi&s;dom is de&s;pi&s;ed, and his words are not heard.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="010768_0005_0F817894716C3CA8">
THE &s;ervices of the truly patriotic are re|warded according to the popular fal&s;e view of things: The meritorious, in this depraved &s;tate, are not certain of equal reward: Envy and ambition, by artifice and cunning, may wre&s;t from the hands of the people, the laurels de&s;igned for their heads, who have done <HI>many worthy deeds</HI> for their country; and all they have done&mdash;be repaid with ba&s;e ingratitude, and cruel neglect. <HI>No man re|membred that &s;ame poor man, who&s;e wi&s;dom delivered the city.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are, notwith&s;tanding, great advan|tages ari&s;ing from wi&s;dom; it yields a home|felt &s;atisfaction, and may be the great &s;ecu|rity of the per&s;on endued with it: And it is al&s;o of great utility to &s;ociety. Tho' this may not be &s;o perceptible when things glide on &s;moothly, yet a time of trial will make it con&s;picuous. In &s;uch a time, wi&s;dom will be found to be &s;uperior to folly &s;urrounded with wealth and aided by martial power; and this is agreable to the ob&s;ervation in the text: <HI>Wi&s;dom is better than weapons of war;</HI> which is a reflection ari&s;ing from the fore|going &s;tory.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="010768_0006_0F81789532221F28">
WHETHER Solomon in this ob&s;ervation leads us to conceive of different kinds of wi&s;dom, according to the different objects about which it is conver&s;ant, or to di&s;tingui&s;h between wi&s;dom political, and religious, may admit of &s;ome di&s;pute. And whether the wi&s;dom by which the poor man delivered the city, in degree, fell &s;hort of, or came up to, that wi&s;dom which in other parts of his writings forms the religious character, is unnoticed. But if wi&s;dom, in the reflection, &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to intend the former, and to exclude the latter; I &s;hall beg leave, in this di&s;cour&s;e to con&s;ider it as including both.</P>
<P>AND accordingly, by divine help, &s;hall endeavour to &s;how,</P>
<P>I. THAT war is to be expected, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of mankind.</P>
<P>II. THAT to provide weapons for defence, is nece&s;&s;ary and fit. But,</P>
<P>III. THAT wi&s;dom is &s;till a higher qua|lification for defence, and will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e better than weapons without it.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="010768_0006_0F81789532221F28">
I. IN the pre&s;ent &s;tate of mankind, war is to be expected.</P>
<P>THE depravity of human nature is the ground and rea&s;on of &s;uch expectation. <HI>God</HI> indeed <HI>made man upright, but they have &s;ought out many inventions;</HI> are warped off from their original con&s;titution, and the whole <HI>world lies in wickedne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true, the di&s;pen&s;ation of grace, early di&s;covered to man, is calculated not only to &s;ave him from the evil con&s;equences of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, but to qualify him for pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s. As it lays a foundation of reconciliation with God, &s;o of the mo&s;t friendly intercour&s;e between man and man, clearly directing, and powerfully a&s;&s;i&s;ting, to the ob&s;ervation of the rules of righteou&s;ne&s;s and charity.</P>
<P>THE moral perfections of the &s;upreme go|vernor forbid the &s;uppo&s;ition, that mankind were left without proper rules of conduct towards him, and one another; or &s;ufficient motives to right action. And revelation clearly vindicates the ways of God to men in this particular.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="010768_0007_0F817895F1124950">
THE law <HI>written in their hearts,</HI> by the finger of their maker, was plain and legible at fir&s;t; and from their longevity in early age, could with more ea&s;e and certainty be tran&s;mited to po&s;terity. Great and general deviations from this rule were followed with &s;ignal vengeance, and &s;urvivors were taught to take warning by the &s;ufferings of others. And the various di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, were adapted to impre&s;s on the mind of man, a reverential regard to the &s;upreme authority.</P>
<P>THIS law, after a while, was committed to writing, and publi&s;hed at Mount Sinai to a &s;elect number of mankind, that by means hereof his <HI>way might be known upon earth, and his &s;aving health among all nations.</HI> The capital precepts of which, tend to promote order and peace in the world, as they &s;trictly enjoin love to God, and love to men; <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart&mdash;and thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>IN the time tho't be&s;t by infinite wi&s;dom, an extraordinary teacher was &s;ent into the world, to &s;et this rule in a clearer light, and
<PB N="13" REF="010768_0007_0F817895F1124950">
to enforce it with additional motives. <HI>This day &s;pring from on high hath vi&s;ited us, to give light to them that &s;it in darkne&s;s, and in the &s;hadow of death; to guide our feet in the way of peace.</HI></P>
<P>BUT love to God, under this clearer di&s;|covery of duty is &s;till <HI>the fir&s;t and great com|mand, and the &s;econd is like unto it, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf.</HI> The way to happine&s;s is the &s;ame: The go&s;pel only throws greater light on it, and urges men into it with greater a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and more powerful motives.</P>
<P>THE means of knowledge, and the motives to duty have, no doubt, been adapted to the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of mankind in every age.&mdash;And in every age, &s;ufficient to lead them to that temper and conduct, which would obtain the approbation of their law-giver and judge, and &s;ecure their own happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE provi&s;ion made by indulgent heaven, &s;uppo&s;es in man under&s;tanding and judg|ment, and a power of determination in point of conduct. And mankind have given &s;ad
<PB N="14" REF="010768_0008_0F817896B8DCCEF8">
evidence of their liberty and &s;elf-determining power, in acting counter to the evidence of truth, and going out of the right way; and while they have approved the better, in fol|lowing the wor&s;e things.</P>
<P>IT is their mi&s;fortune indeed, in this lap|&s;ed &s;tate to have the powers of the mind embarra&s;&s;ed by the ill temperament of the body, which provokes appetite and pa&s;&s;ion, and mi&s;guides the &s;oul in her pur&s;uit after happine&s;s; and is productive of irregularity and di&s;order in the world. The pa&s;&s;ions are forcibly moved by &s;en&s;ible good. The &s;oul, inattentive to higher motives, blindly follows the pa&s;&s;ions; and borne from her natural centre, is hurried on to the violation of the rules of &s;ocial duty. From hence ari&s;e all the oppre&s;&s;ion there is under the &s;un&mdash;all the inva&s;ion of the rights and pro|perties of others&mdash;the rapine and murder &s;o rife among mankind. Jam. 4. 1. <HI>From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lu&s;ts, that war in your members?</HI></P>
<P>IN the mo&s;t authentic hi&s;tory of mankind, we are acquainted with an early deviation
<PB N="15" REF="010768_0008_0F817896B8DCCEF8">
from the rule of conduct, in a gro&s;s act of ho&s;tility and murder, when <HI>Cain ro&s;e up a|gain&s;t Abel his brother and &s;lew him.</HI> Hi&s;to|ry, &s;acred and profane, unite in the exhibi|tion of a continued &s;eries of the like temper and practice, tho' attended with a great va|riety of different circum&s;tances; and make it evident, that mankind, under the general di&s;pen&s;ation of grace, in every age, have cor|rupted them&s;elves, renounced their allegi|ance to the &s;upreme ruler, and unweariedly endeavoured to plunder, en&s;lave, and de&s;troy their own &s;pecies.</P>
<P>THE notices of the divine law in&s;cribed in the heart, and handed down by tradition, have been di&s;regarded, <HI>and as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do tho&s;e things which are not convenient,</HI> but tend to interrupt the order of his creation.</P>
<P>NEITHER have the advantages of a writ|ten law been duly improved by them, as appears by the de&s;cription of &s;uch in Rom. 3. <HI>Their throat is an open &s;epulchre, with their tongues they have u&s;ed deceit, the poi&s;on of a&s;ps is under their lips, who&s;e mouth is full
<PB N="16" REF="010768_0009_0F817897914858D0">
of cur&s;ing and bitterne&s;s, their feet are &s;wift to &s;hed blood, de&s;truction and mi&s;ery are in their ways, and the way of peace have they not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;till clearer di&s;covery of their duty, and urged with the mo&s;t cogent motives, has been ineffectual to procure a compliance&mdash;to pre&s;erve order and peace, and to prevent oppre&s;&s;ion, and the mo&s;t &s;avage treatment of one another. In evidence of which might be adduced the angry debates, the cruel per|&s;ecutions and bloody wars in chri&s;tendom for &s;o many centuries.</P>
<P>OUR Saviour, aware that the be&s;t means to reform and make human nature happy, would be ob&s;tinately oppo&s;ed, and thro' the lu&s;ts of men perverted to interrupt their hap|pine&s;s, gave his followers the precaution in the 10th of Mat. 34th. <HI>Think not that I am come to &s;end peace on earth, I came not to fend peace, but a &s;word;</HI> that they might not be deceived in the expectation of better times than they would actually find.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="010768_0009_0F817897914858D0">
THO' his go&s;pel is eminently calculated to recover human nature to its original recti|tude&mdash;to in&s;pire the heart with love to God and love to men&mdash;to extirpate every unfriendly pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;to cultivate the mo&s;t noble and ex|ten&s;ive benevolence, and to produce univer|&s;al peace and happine&s;s; yet it &s;till lies with man to fall in with the gracious method, or to oppo&s;e it. And as the great author of this glorious plan, when he per&s;onally ap|peared on earth, <HI>was de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of men,</HI> &s;o his religion, ever &s;ince, has fared no better with the mo&s;t. By a &s;trange perver&s;ion of the only method that could reform and make them happy, men have continued, and even encrea&s;ed their di&s;loyalty to heaven, and acts of ho&s;tility to one another.</P>
<P>THUS things, from the beginning of time, have gone on in our world. And tho' before the winding up of this drama, it is firmly, and with ardor expected, that the go&s;pel will more powerfully prevail, and the happy ef|fects of innocence, and peace, will be felt in every part of the earth; <HI>when they &s;hall beat their &s;words into plow&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning hooks, and nation &s;hall not
<PB N="18" REF="010768_0010_0F81789902030F78">
lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, neither &s;hall they learn war any more:</HI> Yet while the go&s;pel &s;preads no further, and has no greater influ|ence where it is known, what can be expect|ed but that mankind &s;hould &s;till be inimi|cal to one another, and <HI>nation &s;hould ri&s;e a|gain&s;t nation,</HI> and <HI>kingdom again&s;t kingdom?</HI> The &s;ame cau&s;e will produce the &s;ame ef|fect. Under &s;imilar circum&s;tances human nature has ever been pretty much the &s;ame. As the former times were not better than the pre&s;ent, why &s;hould the&s;e be better than the former, while the evidence of truth is no more admitted, and appetite and pa&s;&s;ion de|termine the world.</P>
<P>II. To provide weapons for defence is nece&s;&s;ary and &s;it.</P>
<P>THO' indeed there is no ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;i|ty of war, as mankind are not nece&s;&s;itated to break the laws of God, and injure one ano|ther; yet it may be nece&s;&s;ary and &s;it to ac|commodate our&s;elves to it, when thro' the lu&s;ts of men it comes to pa&s;s; and herein, I think, we &s;hall be &s;upported by rea&s;on and revelation.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="010768_0010_0F81789902030F78">
BEING it&s;elf with all the privileges of it, is the communication of happine&s;s from the infinite &s;ource of goodne&s;s. And all the variety of creatures that people the univer&s;e have equal claim to tho&s;e natural privileges which are gratuitou&s;ly derived to them re&s;|pectively from the munificence of their cre|ator.</P>
<P>EVERY creature is naturally inve&s;ted with a power, in &s;ome degree, to &s;ecure that hap|pine&s;s of which it is made capable: And the inva&s;ion of the natural rights of the creature, counter to the con&s;titution of God for the communication of happine&s;s, mu&s;t be wrong.</P>
<P>EVERY rational moral agent is accounta|ble to the creator for its conduct, and re|wardable or puni&s;hable according to it. No &s;uch creature, therefore, has liberty to re&s;ign it's being at plea&s;ure, or willingly to admit the interruption of the natural cour&s;e of things productive of happine&s;s. But is under moral obligation to receive the gifts of its creator with gratitude, and improve them to his honor. And every &s;uch creature has a right to enjoy the&s;e gifts unmole&s;ted, until
<PB N="20" REF="010768_0011_0F817899B0845190">
it has by its own mi&s;conduct forfeited the enjoyment; and is al&s;o under the &s;ame ob|ligation, according to its capacity, and in every fit way, to pre&s;erve and defend the grant of being with all the benefits and privileges thereto belonging. And accordingly there is implanted, in all &s;uch rational beings, a principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and a &s;en&s;e of moral obligation, to di&s;po&s;e them to counter|act the de&s;igns of others to deprive them of happine&s;s, and to break in upon the con&s;ti|tution of God.</P>
<P>IT appears therefore, that the unju&s;t en|croachments on the natural rights of the rational creature, may, and ought to be op|po&s;ed by him.</P>
<P>AND if rea&s;on and argument will not di&s;|&s;uade the invaders from their unrighteous de&s;ign, every other exertion is to be made, according to the ability of the creature, given for the &s;ecurity of its own happine&s;s; for where &s;uch exertions are nece&s;&s;ary to accom|pli&s;h the end, which is right and duty to be accompli&s;hed, they mu&s;t in the rea&s;on of things be fit.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="010768_0011_0F817899B0845190">
OFFENSIVE war in any part of the ratio|nal creation is wrong; as no one has a right to mole&s;t another in the enjoyment of his natural rights, and no &s;ociety of beings has a right to interrupt the happine&s;s of any other &s;ociety.</P>
<P>DEFENSIVE war only, is ju&s;tifiable among rational beings; by which is intended, oppo|&s;ition to others in defence of tho&s;e natural immunities and rights which are the free gift of the creator; and with a view to the general good.</P>
<P>AND &s;uch war may be ju&s;tified, in the rea&s;on of things, among the rational inha|bitants of every world thro'out the univer&s;e; unle&s;s prohibited by the &s;upreme governor, who may direct his creatures to recede from their natural rights, and to re&s;ign their pre|&s;ent enjoyments, in lieu of greater happine&s;s to be conferred in reward of their ob&s;equi|ous re&s;ignation. But without &s;uch interpo|&s;ition, they are under moral obligations to oppo&s;e the inva&s;ion of their rights, and the interruption of the harmony of the univer&s;e.</P>

Whatever may be intended by this part of St. John's vi&s;ion, the &s;criptures certainly lead us to believe, that there is continual oppo&s;i|tion to one another, among the highe&s;t or|ders of creatures we know of, the one coun|teracting the con&s;titution of the creator, the other &s;upporting it, with which their own happine&s;s is in&s;eperably connected.</P>
<P>THE &s;upreme Lord of the univer&s;e hath made creatures of different orders, and a&s;&s;ign|ed to them different parts of his creation. <HI>The earth he hath given to the children of men.</HI> And by making it nece&s;&s;ary to their happine&s;s, and di&s;po&s;ing them, under the go|vernance of his providence, to form into di&s;tinct &s;ocieties, hath divided to them the &s;everal parts of it.

<HI>made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, but hath deter|mined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitations.</HI></P>
<P>MANKIND, therefore, have the gifts of nature, in common with other rational beings, according to their rank in creation, and al&s;o rights and privileges peculiar to nations, which they receive from, and hold under, the great proprietor of the world. It is fit that they &s;hould receive <HI>the&s;e</HI> as the bounty of heaven, and maintain and defend them in that capa|city; e&s;pecially as their natural and political rights are &s;o in&s;eperably blended, that the one cannot be defended without the other.</P>

We are to begin with &s;uch as is adapted to the rational nature. But if addre&s;s to rea&s;on will not impede the determined aggre&s;&s;or, it becomes fit to repel force with force. But yet an enemy is not to be pur&s;ued with revenge after he is con|quered, and to do us further injury is put out of his power; in this &s;ituation we are rather to &s;hew acts of kindne&s;s, and to <HI>over|come

evil with good.</HI> It is unfit that we &s;hould attempt the de&s;truction of mankind, any further than our own &s;afety, and the publick good is connected with it. So far indeed we are under moral obligations to attempt it; but to go beyond this is to exceed the rules of right, and become tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the laws of God our&s;elves.</P>
<P>PUNISHMENT is God's <HI>&s;trange work,</HI> to which he is repre&s;ented as coming reluctant, yet as it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure and promote the happine&s;s of his creation, it is inflicted on the guilty for this benevolent purpo&s;e. Tho' the de&s;truction of our own &s;pecies, in a ju&s;t war, is irk&s;ome to human nature, made after the image of God, if it be not &s;o far debauch|ed as to have lo&s;t all feelings of humanity, yet the moral fitne&s;s of it remains. The like feeling may be had by the righteous judge, in pa&s;&s;ing &s;entence of death on the malefac|tor, who has forfeited his life by the laws of God, and yet he, notwith&s;tanding, be under obligation to fidelity in the execution of his office.</P>
<P>IF by metaphy&s;ical pur&s;uits we may per|plex this matter, and <HI>darken coun&s;el with

words without knowledge;</HI> yet common &s;en&s;e can di&s;cern, that the man who has a drawn &s;word in his hand and tamely &s;ubmits to take a fatal blow from his adver&s;ary, <HI>dies as a fool dieth:</HI> And common con&s;cience would highly approve, if on the contrary, with the &s;word, he had taken the life of the bold in|vader to &s;ave his own.</P>
<P>THE privileges of life, as liberty and pro|perty, in proportion to their value, are to be &s;trenuou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted. And when every thing that is dear, and makes life de&s;irable, and even life it&s;elf is attempted, individuals, or a nation, have not only a bare right, but are under moral obligation to the mo&s;t vigorous oppo&s;ition, as they would not ungratefully re&s;ign the gifts of God, and impiou&s;ly &s;uffer deva&s;tation among his works.</P>
<P>AND this kind of war is &s;upported by the written revelation which God has been plea&s;|ed to give mankind of his will and their duty. If it were not right in the con&s;titution of things, he could not, con&s;i&s;tent with the per|fections of his nature, which it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould contradict, direct, encourage, and
<PB N="26" REF="010768_0014_0F81789F048DF460">
a&s;&s;i&s;t his people to it; but that he did &s;o, mo&s;t evidently appears from the old te&s;ta|ment.</P>
<P>THE new-te&s;tament goes upon the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;ition, and no where forbids it. This part of revelation, indeed, &s;ets the original rule of conduct to mankind, under the di&s;|pen&s;ation of grace, with all the motives to duty, in a clearer and more &s;triking light. It more particularly di&s;&s;uades from tho&s;e practices which are injurious to mankind, and interruptive of their happine&s;s; and as particularly per&s;uades to tho&s;e that are per|fective of their nature.&mdash;And in the whole, is better adapted to promote that temper and life which would take away the occa&s;ions of war: And happy to the world if it were univer&s;ally efficacious!</P>
<P>BUT the go&s;pel no where forbids <HI>that</HI> which in the relation of things is right to be done: This indeed may be advanced to &s;up|port the cau&s;e of infidelity, but is not true in fact: For the go&s;pel, in no part of it, is contradictory to natural religion; if it were, it would want the main evidence to &s;upport its divine authority.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="010768_0014_0F81789F048DF460">
DEFENSIVE war is then right according to the con&s;titution of God, and &s;upported by the written declarations of his will; and in particular, is con&s;i&s;tent with the rules of the go&s;pel; for all the di&s;&s;ua&s;ives therein, from anger, wrath and revenge, and all the per&s;ua&s;ives to meekne&s;s, forgivene&s;s and charity, are reconcileable to the principles of natural religion, which allow and require the defence of our being, with all the privi|leges of being, in every capacity, private or public.</P>
<P>NOT only the bare right, but the moral obligation of defen&s;ive war, being &s;upported by rea&s;on and revelation, the nece&s;&s;ity and fitne&s;s of providing and u&s;ing in&s;truments for that purpo&s;e evidently appears. That is ne|ce&s;&s;ary without which a thing cannot be done, and is nece&s;&s;ary in proportion to the obliga|tion we are under to do the thing.</P>
<P>As the invaders of the rights of others furni&s;h them&s;elves with in&s;truments to exe|cute their unrighteous de&s;igns, &s;o it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to provide &s;omething of the &s;ame kind in order to a &s;ucce&s;sful oppo&s;ition. And as the&s;e aggre&s;&s;ors not only wreck their in|vention
<PB N="28" REF="010768_0015_0F81789FC6F8B6B8">
for &s;uch in&s;truments, but &s;pare no pains to get the dexterous u&s;e of them&punc; &s;o others are obliged to the &s;ame efforts in this re&s;pect, as they would, at lea&s;t, &s;tand upon equal ground with their adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>IT is therefore as nece&s;&s;ary that the art of war &s;hould be cultivated, as that the wea|pons of war &s;hould be provided. And as both are nece&s;&s;ary to defend and &s;ecure the invaded rights of mankind, it is fit a people &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them, and in time of peace prepare for war.</P>
<P>BUT,</P>
<P>III. WISDOM is a higher qualification for defence, and will an&s;wer the purpo&s;e better than weapons without it.</P>
<P>THE rational powers of the mind are the glory of human nature, and a due exerci&s;e of them to the purpo&s;es for which they were given, is wi&s;dom. For wi&s;dom is a ju&s;t di&s;cernment of things, and &s;uch approbation of the mind as to determine the conduct according to it; and right action is, in the con&s;titution of things, productive of happine&s;s: It is &s;o in its natu|ral
<PB N="29" REF="010768_0015_0F81789FC6F8B6B8">
tendency, and as it procures the ble&s;&s;ing of the &s;upreme ruler.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed, different degrees of wi&s;dom according to the different natural ca|pacity, or to the different enlargement of it by improvement. All the human &s;pecies are not made with equal capacity of di&s;cernment. There is evidently a diver&s;ity in the degree of this gift of nature to her &s;ons. Some are naturally formed with a larger capacity than others, as tho' they were born to &s;erve man|kind.</P>
<P>THE natural capacity may be variou&s;ly enlarged, in proportion to the different ad|vantages afforded for that purpo&s;e; or in pro|portion to the improvement of the advanta|ges enjoyed. Accordingly &s;ome, tho' not di&s;tingui&s;hed by nature, may make greater proficiency in wi&s;dom than others.</P>
<P>AND as &s;ocieties are compo&s;ed of individu|als, and there is a clo&s;e connection between the intere&s;ts of &s;uch individuals, &s;o the whole may reap the advantage of the di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities of the few, and on the&s;e the &s;afety of &s;ociety may in a great mea&s;ure depend.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="010768_0016_0F8178A082FBFA20">
THE natural capacity of wi&s;dom may re|main, and may be enlarged in no incon&s;ide|rable mea&s;ure, tho' religious improvement is wanting. Wi&s;dom in this view &s;ometimes an&s;wers great purpo&s;es in the world&mdash;In mi|litary di&s;pute, &s;ucce&s;s very often depends more upon <HI>this,</HI> than the be&s;t contrived in|&s;truments, and the mo&s;t dexterous u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>IT indeed requires no uncommon degree of di&s;cernment to provide weapons, and learn to u&s;e them&mdash;much greater may be nece&s;&s;ary in time of war. To lay the plan of opera|tion&mdash;to lead on to battle, or cover a retreat&mdash;to attend to every circum&s;tance that is con|nected with the well formed plan, requires great &s;agacity and penetration. The wi&s;dom of the politician, and the &s;kill of the &s;oldier, are requi&s;ite to form the great general. And this <HI>wi&s;dom is better than weapons of war,</HI> more to the purpo&s;e of defence again&s;t the injurious attempts of others; as it may ac|compli&s;h <HI>that,</HI> which numbers with the mo&s;t formidable artillery could not effect without it.</P>
<P>BUT wi&s;dom, in that degree which con|&s;titutes the religious character, qualifies &s;till
<PB N="31" REF="010768_0016_0F8178A082FBFA20">
more for &s;ucce&s;sful defence. That temper of mind towards the deity, and conduct of life, which our holy religion requires, is the true&s;t wi&s;dom, and better qualifies the &s;ame per&s;ons for the performance of common du|ty, and for great atchievements, and, which is more, for the ble&s;&s;ing of God, than any thing &s;hort of it can po&s;&s;ibly do. And in military conte&s;t, this qualification may operate through the <HI>whole,</HI> in officers and &s;oldiers, and in tho&s;e who are not immedi|ately engaged in the action, but who&s;e inte|re&s;t is clo&s;ely connected with it, and &s;o may have a great influence in the deci&s;ion of the &s;u&s;pended important event.</P>
<P>RELIGION is &s;o far from ob&s;tructing the free exerci&s;e of the powers of the mind, that it naturally tends to &s;trengthen and enlarge them. The mind was formed for God, and religion is the tendency of the &s;oul to its proper centre; and in that &s;tate it mu&s;t be the mo&s;t healthful and vigorous: The more it exerci&s;es its powers, in this way, the more vigorous they will grow; and on &s;uppo&s;ition of the continuance of virtuous exertions, this progre&s;&s;ion will continue thro'out its exi&s;t|ence.
<PB N="32" REF="010768_0017_0F8178A147A35A50">
Conformity to the precepts of the go&s;pel, is acting up to the dignity of our na|ture, and truly perfective of it. All the ad|vantages of wi&s;dom in the before-mentioned degree therefore, may be had in time of dan|ger, and greater hoped for, as the mind aided by religion, will be more capable of tho&s;e exertions, which are nece&s;&s;ary to lay the plan of defence, and to di&s;cern the be&s;t mea&s;ures for the execution of it.</P>
<P>RELIGION al&s;o in&s;pires its votaries with the true&s;t magnanimity and courage, and therefore, be&s;t qualifies for oppo&s;ition again&s;t the injurious attempts of bold a&s;&s;ailants. It enobles the &s;oul, as it rai&s;es its views above the fordid plea&s;ures of this world, and directs them to nobler objects, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;embles it to its great original.&mdash;It lays a foundation for confidence in God, and for the hope of a ble&s;&s;ed immortality. It re|moves the grounds of tho&s;e fears that ari&s;e from con&s;cious guilt, and a &s;en&s;e of de&s;erved puni&s;hment; and intitles to a like triumph with that of the devout warrior in I&s;rael, <HI>Though an ho&s;t &s;hould encamp again&s;t me, my heart &s;hall not fear; tho' war &s;hould ri&s;e
<PB N="33" REF="010768_0017_0F8178A147A35A50">
again&s;t me, in this will I be confident.</HI> As there is nothing to be hoped for from this world, or to be feared in the next, by the virtuous and good, &s;o they only with &s;afety can brave danger, and go on intrepid in the path of duty. Hardine&s;s of con&s;titution, and the mere love of fame may indeed lead on to perilous enterprizes; but religion better qualifies the &s;oldier to face danger, and <HI>jeo|pard his life in the high places of the field. The wicked,</HI> as they act from meaner princi|ples, and are urged on by inferior motives, will more readily quit their po&s;t, and if at|tentive to the fatal con&s;equences of falling in battle, mu&s;t <HI>flee when no man per&s;ueth:</HI> But <HI>the righteous,</HI> under a &s;en&s;e of moral obli|gation, and in hope of reward after this life is ended, in every department of duty, will be <HI>bold as a lion.</HI></P>
<P>THE advantage therefore &s;till lies on the &s;ide of religion, as it greatens the mind, in|&s;pires it with the true&s;t fortitude, and will animate the &s;oldier to act his part with in|trepidity and vigor, without which weapons of war would be to little purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="010768_0018_0F8178A22B299750">
RELIGION likewi&s;e qualifies for, and en|titles to the ble&s;&s;ing of providence, on which &s;ucce&s;s in military enterprize, chiefly depends. The &s;uperintendency of the Deity over all his works, and his intervention in human affairs, is agreable to rea&s;on, and plainly a&s;&s;erted in revelation. The de&s;igns of his providence, indeed, are carried on by means, but the energy of the means depends on his ble&s;&s;ing. The means that are be&s;t adapted to the end are generally &s;ucceeded, but not always &s;o; &s;ometimes the&s;e are fru&s;trated, and the mo&s;t improbable take place, to let us know that the <HI>Mo&s;t High ruleth in the kingdom of men,</HI> and to teach us dependance on him. This gave ri&s;e to the wi&s;e ob&s;erva|tion of Solomon in the context. <HI>The race is not to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong, neither yet bread to the wi&s;e, nor yet riches to men of under&s;tanding, nor yet favor to men of &s;kill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</HI></P>
<P>THE interpo&s;ition of providence &s;ome have tho't, is more clearly di&s;cernable in the events of war, than in any other, as tho&s;e
<PB N="35" REF="010768_0018_0F8178A22B299750">
have a more immediate connection with the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of communities. But be that as it may, the &s;cripture, it is certain, every where attributes the &s;ucce&s;s of war to a divine influence&mdash;to the <HI>Lord of ho&s;ts and God of armies;</HI> and gives the hi&s;tory of &s;ome victories obtained beyond all human probabilities.</P>
<P>BUT if, at &s;ometimes, in this way, God has <HI>rode in his excellency on the &s;ky,</HI> for the help of his people, and <HI>made bare his arm</HI> in their &s;alvation, yet his influence is as real, tho' not &s;o vi&s;ible, when the means that come within the verge of human power are &s;ucceeded to the like purpo&s;es. And no doubt this divine influence is concerned, when the fate of armies, and the events of war, &s;eem to turn upon &s;ome trifling circum&s;tance untho't of, or little incident unfore&s;een, by means of which a mighty army &s;hall be &s;eized with a panic, and one le&s;s formidable in number and &s;trength &s;hall be &s;o in&s;pirited, that an hundred &s;hall cha&s;e a thou&s;and, and a thou&s;and put ten thou&s;and to flight.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="010768_0019_0F8178A2D6096B20">
IT mu&s;t therefore be of the greate&s;t con|&s;equence to a nation, in military controver&s;y, to engage the &s;upreme Di&s;po&s;er of all events on their &s;ide: And the only way for them to do &s;o, is to &s;ubmit to his authority as the &s;upreme lawgiver&mdash;to live up to the rules of conduct pre&s;cribed by him, according to their mea&s;ure in this &s;tate of imperfection.</P>
<P><HI>THIS</HI> will qualify them for his favor; for <HI>the righteous Lord loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And <HI>this</HI> will entitle them to the ble&s;&s;ings of his providence, according to the tenor of all his promi&s;es of national ble&s;&s;ings in the holy &s;criptures.

THIS di&s;cour&s;e gives countenance to the military appearance of this day, and to all &s;uitable preparations for war.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company,</HI> was founded upon fit principles and for laudable purpo&s;es. Our fathers te|nacious of their rights, and awake to a &s;en&s;e of duty, early laid this plan, as a nur&s;ery of military &s;kill, for the public &s;afety: The heads of the people freely offered them&s;elves to the&s;e exerci&s;es, with a view to cultivate and improve the art of war, that the community might be put into a &s;tate of defence. Our military preparations have been &s;ucceeded to their de&s;igned end, from the days of our fa|thers.&mdash;Thro' God we have done valiantly, and beat down our foes.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Canada with its dependencies, which has been the &s;ource of the chief of our difficulties, is by the kind and vigorous a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Briti&s;h troops, now conquered, and there is peace in our borders; yet it may be idle to dream that we &s;hall never any more have occa&s;ion to put on the harne&s;s.

to recover the&s;e lo&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to the crown of France, and of con&s;equence not certain but that the pre&s;ent &s;ubmi&s;s but popi&s;h inha|bitants will become ho&s;tile again, and hara&s;s our infant &s;ettlements extended &s;till nearer to them by our late glorious acqui&s;itions.</P>
<P>BUT if we &s;hould not be called to defend the frontiers from the &s;word of the wilder|ne&s;s, or with greater numbers to maintain our conque&s;ts; we may yet have need of ar|mour and military &s;kill to defend us on &s;ome other quarter; for the more oppulent we grow, the more we may become the object of the attention and aim of &s;ome foreign rapacious power.</P>
<P>THERE being more than a po&s;&s;ibility of things of this nature taking place, in &s;ome future, and perhaps not very di&s;tant period; it is fit that we &s;hould hold our&s;elves in rea|dine&s;s for defence, and truly noble in tho&s;e who, of their own accord, exert them&s;elves to &s;pread the art of war, and promote &s;uch preparations.</P>
