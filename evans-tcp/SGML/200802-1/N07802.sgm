<BIBL>ISAIAH, XLIX. 23.</BIBL>
<Q>AND KINGS SHALL BE THY NURSING FATHERS; AND THEIR QUEENS THY NURSING MOTHERS:&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_TIS a melancholy truth, confirmed by the hi&s;tory of all nations, that the rulers of this world have generally &s;et them&s;elves in oppo&s;ition to the intere&s;t of true re|ligion, and the cau&s;e of CHRIST. Al|though mankind have always been &s;en&s;ible that a proper veneration of, and regard to the DEITY, and a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of our obligation unto him, is the be&s;t, and indeed the only &s;ecurity of civil government; and hence have very naturally concluded that civil rulers ought to provide for, and &s;upport the publick exer|ci&s;es of religion: yet, &s;uch have been the unhappy mi&s;takes and prejudices they have laboured under, that wherever the go&s;pel hath been &s;ent among a peo|ple, the powers in being, in&s;tead of nouri&s;hing, have too often &s;et them&s;elves to oppre&s;s and per&s;ecute the church of CHRIST. This was the ca&s;e for the fir&s;t three hundred years after the publication of the chri&s;|tian &s;cheme, it met with violent oppo&s;ition from all orders and degrees of men, from the powers of this
<PB N="6" REF="009955_0005_0F7B3F8DDF252500">
world, and the powers of darkne&s;s al&s;o; and even till this day, the religion of the go&s;pel labours under much oppre&s;&s;ion from the greater part of civil rulers. 'Tis &s;trange indeed, that it &s;hould be &s;o! One ac|quainted with human nature, who only con&s;idered the genius and temper of chri&s;tianity, how friendly it is to civil government, and how careful of its ju&s;t rights, would never imagine this could be the ca&s;e; for tis certain, that the go&s;pel above all other religions, in|&s;tructs mankind in the duties they owe unto their lawful rulers; and on the &s;evere&s;t penalties, urges the ob&s;ervance and the practi&s;e of them. But yet, experience &s;hews, that it has met with little proper encouragement from the greater part of civil rulers. However, we have rea&s;on to hope that it will not al|ways be &s;o: &s;acred writ gives us ground to expect happier times in the latter days; when chri&s;ti|anity &s;hall &s;pread it&s;elf far and wide, and cover the earth, as the waters do the &s;eas; when every knee &s;hall bow to CHRIST, and every tongue proclaim his prai&s;es; when kings and princes, in&s;tead of oppo&s;ing, &s;hall employ their power and influence to protect and favour the church of CHRIST. To u&s;e the language of the text, <HI>Kings &s;hall be nur&s;ing fathers, and queens nur&s;ing mothers to it;</HI>&mdash;<HI>they &s;hall bow down with their face to the earth, and lick up the du&s;t of its feet:</HI> i. e. they &s;hall nouri&s;h and protect the church, and pay all due honor and regard to it. I am &s;ufficiently aware, that this prophe&s;y had a primary reference to the Jew's return from the Babyloni&s;h captivity; and that it had a partial accompli&s;hment, when <HI>Cyrus, Artaxerxes, Darius,</HI> and other Per&s;ian monarchs i&s;&s;ued royal mandates in their favour, and brought them back unto their own land. It had al&s;o a further and more glorious accompli&s;hment when <HI>Con&s;tantine, The|odo&s;ius,</HI> and other Roman emperors publickly patro|nized chri&s;tianity and e&s;tabli&s;hed it in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="009955_0006_0F7B3F8ED41A60A8">
And whenever the &s;ceptre is put into the hands of a pious and religious prince, this prophe&s;y has &s;till a further fulfilment. However, I take it to be plain, that nothing which hath ever yet happened, in any mea&s;ure comes up to tho&s;e glorious things, which in this chapter, and el&s;ewhere are &s;poken of the city of GOD; and that it hath a particular reference to the la&s;t happy days, when the mountain of the LORD's hou&s;e &s;hall lift it&s;elf up above the top of the moun|tains, and the top of the hills, and &s;hall cover the face of the whole earth. When all nations &s;hall look to Zion and be &s;aved. But I mean not to enter largely into this matter; thus much may fairly be infered from the text, that civil rulers ought to be nur&s;ing fathers to the church; and that we may look for a time when they will really be &s;o. I &s;hall therefore on this occa&s;ion only endeavor to &s;hew,

<P>Here then let us enquire,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. How, and in what ways civil rulers are to be nur&s;ing fathers to the church of CHRIST?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>To this, I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. They are to protect and defend it from the malice and in&s;ults of all its enemies. The church of CHRIST hath always had its enemies in the world, who either in a more open and publick, or in a more &s;e|cret and concealed manner have &s;ought its ruin. And many times for wi&s;e and holy purpo&s;es, Divine Providence hath permitted them greatly to prevail; &s;o that the hearts of GOD's faithful ones have almo&s;t fainted, and the church to all appearance been on the
<PB N="8" REF="009955_0007_0F7B3F8F097E4088">
brink of ruin. This particularly was the ca&s;e &s;oon after the fir&s;t planting of chri&s;tianity in the world, many enemies cau&s;ele&s;ly ro&s;e up again&s;t it; and though &s;ome lucid intervals came between, &s;ome times of quiet and of re&s;t; yet the church laboured under a dark cloud, a &s;eries of oppre&s;&s;ion for near three hundred years together; during which time, no le&s;s than ten per&s;ecutions, &s;evere and cruel per|&s;ecutions followed one upon the back of another. And often &s;ince, GOD hath permitted the enemy great|ly to prevail, and to rai&s;e many cruel &s;torms of per|&s;ecution again&s;t the church of CHRIST. The hi&s;tory of the faithful in almo&s;t every age and country will produce many in&s;tances of this: nor may we hope that the church will ever be free from enemies; to be&s;ure, before the la&s;t happy times, prophe&s;ied of in my text, and el&s;ewhere, when CHRIST &s;hall have the heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; <HI>when kings &s;hall be nur&s;ing fathers, and queens nur&s;ing mothers to it.</HI> The church is now in a militant &s;tate; and we may al|ways expect that the <HI>Dragon</HI> will per&s;ecute the wo|man. Satan and wicked men will always &s;et them|&s;elves again&s;t the people of GOD, and &s;ay of Jeru&s;a|lem, <HI>let us ra&s;e it, let us ra&s;e it even to the foundation.</HI></P>
<P>Now tis the duty of civil rulers to protect and de|fend the church, and people of CHRIST from the in|&s;ults of all their enemies, and not &s;uffer the adver&s;ary to hurt or take away their privileges. They are in|deed to protect and defend all, in the enjoyment of their ju&s;t rights, and not &s;uffer the &s;tronger, like bea&s;ts of prey to oppre&s;s and devour the weaker. They are armed with power and authority for this pur|po&s;e. And e&s;pecially &s;hould this their authority be exerci&s;ed for the protection of the church&mdash;not in|deed that the civil authority are to per&s;ecute others, for not being chri&s;tians; CHRIST never called for fire
<PB N="9" REF="009955_0008_0F7B3F8FD1DE62F8">
from heaven to devour his adver&s;aries; but they are to re&s;train tho&s;e that &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t the church, and not &s;uffer the enemy to vex and to de|&s;troy it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Civil rulers are to &s;uppre&s;s all immorality and vice, and to encourage the practice of virtue and piety.&mdash;Immorality and vice is highly detrimental not only to the civil, but e&s;pecially to the religious intere&s;ts of mankind. It &s;ets it&s;elf in oppo&s;ition to them, and in proportion as the former increa&s;es, the latter mu&s;t decay. While on the other hand, virtue and piety are an honor and an ornament to a peo|ple, and the be&s;t &s;ecurity, both of church and &s;tate. Civil rulers &s;hould therefore &s;et them&s;elves to en|courage the one, and to di&s;countenance and di&s;|courage the other. They are by office bound to op|po&s;e evil men, and evil things, and to &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;t the good. By divine in&s;titution, they are to be <HI>terrors to evil doers, and a prai&s;e to them that do well.</HI> For this end they are armed with power and authority, and are <HI>mini&s;ters of God to execute vengeance on them that do evil.</HI> I am &s;en&s;ible indeed, that many &s;orts of immorality and vice lie &s;ecret and concealed from public view, and fall not properly under the cognizance of the civil magi&s;trate, nor are they puni&s;h|able by the &s;tate; but others are open and publick, &s;uch as profaning the name of GOD and religion, fraud, theft, inju&s;tice, intemperance, uncleanne&s;s, &amp;c. The&s;e are properly within the juri&s;diction of the civil magi&s;trate, and he ought to &s;upport religion, by employing his power and influence to di&s;counte|nance and di&s;courage them, and to promote and en|courage their contrary virtues. And <HI>the eyes</HI> of good rulers <HI>will be open upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell in their &s;ight; they will early de&s;troy the workers of iniquity, and cut them off from the land.</HI></P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="10" REF="009955_0009_0F7B3F907AD40B18">
3. Civil rulers are to &s;upport and maintain religi|on, and to provide for the publick exerci&s;es of it.&mdash;Religion can't be &s;upported and maintained in the world, without &s;ome expence. Though the &s;ervice of the go&s;pel is not burthen&s;ome, like that of the law; yet, in the nature of the thing, there mu&s;t be &s;ome expence attending the public profe&s;&s;ion and practice of it. This the civil magi&s;trate is to take care of, and make &s;uitable provi&s;ion for. When GOD conde|&s;cended to take upon him&s;elf the more immediate government of the Jewi&s;h nation, as their king, he not only in&s;tituted and appointed a religion for them to attend upon; but obliged the rulers of the people, as his &s;ub&s;titues in government, to take care, that the public exerci&s;es of it were kept up and maintained, and the nece&s;&s;ary expences of it provided for. And all along, under that di&s;pen&s;ation, we find good ru|lers taking care of the&s;e things. <HI>David</HI> made provi|&s;ion for building the temple, and <HI>Solomon</HI> carried it into execution. And whenever civil rulers have been carele&s;s, and neglected this part of their tru&s;t, GOD has &s;everely reproved them. <HI>Nehemiah</HI> contend|ed with the rulers, and rebuked them, becau&s;e the hou&s;e of the LORD was neglected, the tythe with|held, and the prie&s;ts, GOD's mini&s;ters in religion, not duly &s;upported. And 'tis evident, that under the law, a very ample provi&s;ion was made, for the public &s;upport and maintenance of religion, and all the of|ficers of it, even by GOD him&s;elf.&mdash;Nor was this a notion peculiar to the Jews; all nations, as far as hi&s;tory looks back, have adopted, in &s;ub&s;tance, very much the &s;ame &s;entiments. Even the heathen, who had only the dim light of nature, have been &s;en&s;ible, that the public profe&s;&s;ion and practice of religion, was a benefit to the &s;tate, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to the &s;afety and &s;ecurity of civil government. Hence, wi&s;e legi&s;lators, in all nations, have made early provi&s;ion
<PB N="11" REF="009955_0010_0F7B3F91830427E0">
for this. All antient hi&s;tory, ju&s;tifies the truth of this ob&s;ervation. So that 'tis hard to find, among man|kind, any nation or people, wherein any regular, ci|vil polity, hath been e&s;tabli&s;hed, who have not made &s;ome kind of provi&s;ion for the &s;upport and mainte|nance of public wor&s;hip, in &s;ome form or other. A due veneration of the Deity, and &s;en&s;e of our obligations to him, being the be&s;t &s;ecurity mankind can po&s;&s;ibly have, of the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of their lives, liberties and properties. Hence, athei&s;m and infidelity have been odious every where; and the public hath always made provi&s;ion to in&s;truct man|kind in the duties of morality and virtue, and to &s;up|port the wor&s;hip of GOD. Chri&s;tian princes have al|&s;o ever adopted the &s;ame &s;entiments. <HI>Con&s;tantine, Theodo&s;ius,</HI> and all the fir&s;t chri&s;tian emperors, made it one of their earlie&s;t cares, publicly to patronize re|ligion, and to provide for, and &s;upport the mini&s;ters of it. This practice hath been continued ever &s;ince; nor is there at this day, any chri&s;tian &s;tate, or nation in Europe, where no public provi&s;ion is made for the e&s;tabli&s;hment and &s;upport of religion. Bri|tain, from the mo&s;t early ages, hath had her e&s;tab|li&s;hments. The public &s;upport and maintenance of religion is liberally provided for, in the land of our forefather's nativity. The chri&s;tian religion is a part of the common law, and the king, and all in autho|rity, are bound to &s;upport it. Our fathers, the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this country, brought with them the &s;ame &s;entiments; and in almo&s;t all the &s;everal govern|ments in New-England, made early provi&s;ion for the &s;upport of a learned and orthodox mini&s;try. Very particular care for this purpo&s;e, was taken by the le|gi&s;lative authority, in this colony, not only by ena|bling every town and &s;ociety, to &s;upport the mini&s;try, by a rate or tax, laid on the polls, and rateable e&s;tates of all their inhabitants, but by obliging them to &s;et|tle
<PB N="12" REF="009955_0011_0F7B3F91F6526AF8">
a mini&s;ter. The &s;upport and maintenance of public wor&s;hip, our fathers con&s;idered as a debt due from in|dividuals to the public; and undoubtedly imagin'd the law, as it then &s;tood, had created &s;uch a fund as would be &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e, in all &s;ucceeding gene|rations. I mention the&s;e facts, not as demon&s;trative proofs or arguments of the point in view; but only to &s;hew, that the doctrine of religious e&s;tabli&s;hments, however faulted by many, is a doctrine that approves it&s;elf to the human mind; otherwi&s;e 'tis &s;carcely to be imagined, that the wi&s;e&s;t and greate&s;t legi&s;lators in all ages, and among all nations would have &s;o generally adopted it. I well know, that the notions of man|kind, have been almo&s;t infinitely various; and that &s;ome have carried it a great deal further than others; yet common &s;en&s;e has taught all, that as GOD is to be wor&s;hipped, wor&s;hipped in public as well as in private; public care, in &s;ome &s;hape or other, &s;hould be taken, to provide for it.&mdash;After all, I am not in&s;en&s;ible, that in mo&s;t in&s;tances, civil rulers have gone a great deal too far, over and above e&s;tabli&s;hing and &s;upporting that religion which they accounted mo&s;t agreable to the Deity, and mo&s;t beneficial to the &s;tate: They have oppre&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted others, who happened to differ from them, in their religious &s;entiments, even though they were peaceable members of civil government. And many times, bitter per&s;ecutions have been rai&s;ed, about mere trifles. I am far from ju&s;tifying, or even pretending to extenuate any con|duct of this kind. The rights of con&s;cience are &s;a|cred, are unalienable; every man is under higher obligations to his Maker, than he is, or can be, to any earthly rulers whatever; and &s;hould therefore be left at liberty to wor&s;hip GOD according to the dic|tates of his own con&s;cience, provided his principles and practice are &s;uch, as give no ju&s;t umbrage, no di&s;turbance to the &s;tate. But then, on the other hand,
<PB N="13" REF="009955_0012_0F7B3F94310FFB78">
all that are di&s;&s;enters from any religious e&s;tabli&s;hment, have rea&s;on to expect is, that they be protected in the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of their lives, liberties and properties, and in the free and undi&s;turbed exerci&s;e of their own religion. They can't, I apprehend, claim the peculiar favours of the &s;tate, or an exemption from contributing, in &s;ome ju&s;t proportion, to &s;upport the re|ligion of it.&mdash;I am very &s;en&s;ible, that this is one of the tendere&s;t and mo&s;t delicate points that can well be touched upon, that civil, rulers too generally have, and may again abu&s;e their power; and, under pretence of &s;upporting truth, oppre&s;s and per&s;ecute the inno|cent.&mdash;However, there is an extreme on the other hand; and 'tis po&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t, we may have verged too much towards that: But to prevent all mi&s;appre|hen&s;ions, I beg leave to add further here, that every e&s;tabli&s;hment, of a religious kind, ought to be made on the mo&s;t generous, catholic principles; none &s;hould be denied the privileges of it, but for very material points indeed; little differences of opinion, about mere modes and ceremonies, or nice, &s;pecula|tive points of controver&s;y, that don't greatly affect practical godline&s;s and virtue, and have no pernicious influence on the &s;tate, ought not to exclude any from the benefits of it. I add further,</P>
<P N="4">4. That civil rulers &s;hould profe&s;s religion them|&s;elves, and &s;et good examples of obedience to it.&mdash;The divine law requires this of all men; of the high as well as of the low, of the rich, as well as of the poor; of the greate&s;t prince, as well as of the mean|e&s;t &s;ubject. None is above &s;ubjection unto GOD, none &s;o high and elevated, as not to be bound to bow the knee to the KING of kings, the &s;overeign Lord and Ruler of the univer&s;e. If tho&s;e in the mo&s;t dig|nified &s;tations, are a&s;hamed of CHRIST, he will be a&s;hamed of them, when he comes in his own glory, in the glory of the Father, and with his holy angels,
<PB N="14" REF="009955_0013_0F7B3F94D33A2A38">
to judge both quick and dead. Civil rulers then, as men, are under the &s;ame obligations with their neigh|bours, with other men to profe&s;s the religion of CHRIST, and to pay obedience to it; but as men ad|vanced to high and elevated &s;tations in life, they are under peculiar obligations unto this, becau&s;e their ex|amples, as they are either good or bad, have a mighty influence, either to reform or debauch a people, and deluge them in immorality and vice. If we look into the word of GOD, we always find, that when a good and religious prince a&s;cended the throne of I&s;rael, re|ligion flouri&s;hed through the nation, and the wor&s;hip of GOD was duly attended every where; while on the other hand, when an idolatrous prince reigned, idolatry and wickedne&s;s became general among the people. Mankind are always apt to imitate their betters: when tho&s;e in lower life, &s;ee tho&s;e above them religiou&s;ly bending the knee to GOD, and paying obedience to his holy laws; religion then be|comes fa&s;hionable, and all account it an honor to ob|tain that character. But when great men contemn the laws of CHRIST, and live in open oppo&s;ition to them, the infection naturally &s;preads through the land, and the giddy multitude are ea&s;ily borne away by the force of their evil examples. The univer&s;al hi&s;tory and ob&s;ervation of mankind in all ages will con|firm the truth of this; nor hath it ever been known, when princes' courts have been greatly corruted, but that the people in general have been corrupted too. Civil rulers then, men in dignified po&s;ts and places, are not only under all the common obligations of other men to profe&s;s and practice religion, but they are under &s;pecial, they are under peculiar and additi|onal obligations from their elevated characters al&s;o; and when they contemn and de&s;pi&s;e it, and &s;et bad examples before the people, their guilt is doubly ag|gravated above that of other men. Once more,</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="15" REF="009955_0014_0F7B3F956AEB4630">
5. Civil rulers &s;hould u&s;e their endeavours to pro|pogate religion, and to &s;pread the knowledge of it through the world;&mdash;all men indeed are required to do this; all are to pray that the kingdom of CHRIST may come, and his will be done on earth, as 'tis done in heaven. And if we are to pray for this, then are we to endeavour to promote the RE|DEEMER's kingdom in this world. Regard for the honor of GOD, and the immortal &s;ouls of our fellow men require this at our hands. Nor is there any &s;o mean and low, &s;o incon&s;iderable in life, but they may do &s;omething to help forward this good work; pro|vided they &s;uitably exert them&s;elves: <HI>A &s;mall &s;park kindleth a great fire. The kingdom of heaven is likened to a grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed, which, when ca&s;t into the earth, is the &s;malle&s;t of all &s;eeds; but when grown up, it be|cometh a great and a mighty tree.</HI> So from the &s;malle&s;t efforts of ours, in the cau&s;e of CHRIST; great and mighty fruits may follow: the&s;e through the divine ble&s;&s;ing, may become the beginnings of a general re|formation in the place and nation where we belong; and at length &s;pread it&s;elf even to the uttermo&s;t ends of the earth. The go&s;pel it&s;elf had &s;mall beginnings: JESUS its ble&s;&s;ed author, was in the eyes of men but of mean and low degree;&mdash;twelve poor, de&s;pi&s;ed, il|literate fi&s;hermen; made but a mean appearance a|gain&s;t all the great and learned rabbies, and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed religions of the world: but through a Divine Power accompanying them, great and mighty effects were &s;oon &s;een; in a few years chri&s;tianity &s;pread it&s;elf every where; idols and idolatry fell before it. Men in the lowe&s;t &s;tations of life, then &s;hould not be di&s;couraged from exerting them&s;elves in the cau&s;e of CHRIST; GOD may make them in&s;truments of great good to the church and world. But tho&s;e in high and elevated places are under peculiar advanta|ges

to do this; and in proportion to their advantages, &s;o are their obligations greater than other men's. They are arm'd with power and authority; and GOD expects more from them than others. And would kings and princes, great and mighty men, unitedly exert them&s;elves in the Redeemer's cau&s;e, it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that a great and mighty alteration would &s;oon be brought about. Religion would &s;pread far and wide in the world: Every knee would bow to CHRIST, and the knowledge of the go&s;pel would cover the earth, as the waters do the &s;eas.&mdash;</P>
<P>In all the&s;e ways, civil rulers are to be nur&s;ing fa|thers to the church; they are to protect and defend it from the in&s;ults and malice of all its enemies, and to re&s;train tho&s;e that &s;ay of Jeru&s;alem, <HI>Let us ra&s;e it, let us ra&s;e it, even to the foundations thereof.</HI> They are to &s;uppre&s;s all immorality and vice, and every thing that is contrary to the pure precepts of religion, and to encourage piety and virtue. They are to be <HI>ter|rors to evil doers, and a prai&s;e to them that do well.</HI> They are to &s;upport and maintain religion, and to provide for the public exerci&s;es of it. They are al&s;o to profe&s;s religion them&s;elves; to bow the knee to the LORD JESUS, and to &s;et &s;uitable examples of obe|dience to his holy laws. And they are likewi&s;e to u&s;e their authority and influence, to promote the REDEEMER's kingdom in the world; and to endea|vour, that the knowledge of our glorious SAVIOUR may be extended from the ri&s;ing to the &s;etting &s;un.&mdash;In all the&s;e ways are civil rulers to approve them|&s;elves nur&s;ing fathers unto the church of CHRIST.</P>
<P>I now go on to &s;hew,</P>
<P>II. The rea&s;ons of the doctrine, or why civil ru|lers are to be nur&s;ing fathers to the church. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Their duty unto GOD obliges unto this.&mdash;They are his mini&s;ters, they are his &s;ervants; <HI>by him
<PB N="17" REF="009955_0016_0F7B3F96766D26B8">
it is that kings reign, and princes decree ju&s;tice.</HI> 'Tis GOD that gave them power and authority, and ad|vanced them to their high and elevated &s;tations in life: As his mini&s;ters therefore, they &s;hould &s;trive to promote his honor, intere&s;t and kingdom in the world; in faithfulne&s;s to him, and as his &s;ervants, they are bound to do it. He gave them their power and authority to enable them to &s;erve the cau&s;e of vir|tue and goodne&s;s, more and better than otherwi&s;e they could do. If they neglect it, they are unfaithful to their tru&s;t, and violate their allegiance unto GOD the KING of Kings, and Sovereign Prince of all the princes of the earth. Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. The practice of religion and virtue tends, a|bove all things, to promote the public welfare and happine&s;s of mankind, and to &s;ecure the ends of ci|vil government; therefore rulers &s;hould be nur&s;ing fathers to it.&mdash;Civil government was originally in&s;ti|tuted to protect and defend men's lives and liberties, to guard and &s;ecure their properties, and promote their temporal intere&s;ts and advantages. In a &s;tate of nature, where there is no common judge to de|termine controver&s;ies, and no one armed with power and authority to &s;uppre&s;s the in&s;olences of trouble|&s;ome and contentious men; all our valuable intere&s;ts would be in-&s;ecure, and the &s;tronger, like bea&s;ts of prey, would be apt to devour and de&s;troy the wea|ker. To prevent this, and to lay a firm foundation of &s;ecurity and happine&s;s unto all, men entered into civil combinations and &s;ocieties, and &s;et up govern|ment in the world. Now the practice of religion and virtue, tends, above all other things, to promote tho&s;e very ends, for which men entered into &s;ociety. The go&s;pel forbids all tho&s;e vices that are contrary to,
<PB N="18" REF="009955_0017_0F7B3F9784069808">
and tend to defeat the end of civil government; and it requires the ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e virtues that are friendly to it. Uncleanne&s;s, intemperance, fraud, cruelty, malice, idlene&s;s and inju&s;tice, of every kind, are directly contrary to the ends of civil government, and tend to bring confu&s;ion and ruin on the &s;tate. But our holy religion, &s;trictly forbids all the&s;e things, and, indeed, every other &s;ort of immorality and vice, that civil government was de&s;igned to rectify, and reform. And, on the other hand, the go&s;pel requires cha&s;tity, temperance, frugality, diligence, ju&s;tice, benevolence, and all tho&s;e virtues that are nece&s;&s;ary, to the public welfare and happine&s;s of a people. Barely con&s;idered as a &s;et, a body of laws, and with|out any regard to its being a divine revelation; the bible is the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of moral and political virtue, that ever was publi&s;hed in the world; and wherever the religion of it is duly implanted in the heart, it lays the greate&s;t obligations to all civil offices, and moral duties; for it reaches to the heart and con&s;ci|ences of men, and obliges them, not bearly for fear of puni&s;hment, but for con&s;cience &s;ake, to practice tho&s;e very virtues that are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the well-being and &s;afety of the &s;tate. Chri&s;tianity, if cordially embraced, and acted up to, would make all men really virtuous and good: It would have the be&s;t effects, both upon rulers, and upon &s;ubjects&mdash;it would teach magi&s;trates to be ju&s;t, and to rule in the fear of GOD, and &s;o would &s;trengthen their au|thority, and procure veneration and re&s;pect from all; <Q>Whereas (as one expre&s;&s;es it) impiety and vice do &s;trangely le&s;&s;en the greatne&s;s of maje&s;ty, and &s;e|cretly, yet unavoidably bring weakne&s;s upon au|thority it&s;elf.</Q>&mdash;Religion would al&s;o have a good influence upon &s;ubjects, <Q>it would make them obe|dient
<PB N="19" REF="009955_0018_0F7B3F98543C2918">
unto government, and conformable to the laws, and that not from wrath, and out of fear of the magi&s;trates power (which, as one ob&s;erves, is but a loo&s;e principle of obedience, and will cea&s;e, whenever a man can rebel with &s;afety and impuni|ty) but out of Con&s;cience, which is a firm, con&s;tant and la&s;ting principle, and will hold a man fa&s;t, when all other principles cea&s;e and lo&s;e their pow|er.</Q> He that really entertains the principles of chri&s;tianity in his heart, will not, on any trifling pre|tences, be tempted from his allegiance to his lawful prince; knowing, that they who re&s;i&s;t authority, re|&s;i&s;t the ordinances of GOD; and that they who re&s;i&s;t, &s;hall receive to them&s;elves damnation.</P>
<P>Moreover, religion tends to make men quiet and peaceable, one towards another; it endeavours to implant in us all the&s;e qualities and di&s;po&s;itions of mind, which tend to peace and unity, and to fill men with a &s;pirit of univer&s;al love and good-will. It likewi&s;e aims at &s;ecuring men's intere&s;t, by requiring ju&s;tice and equity in all our dealings and intercour&s;e, one with another; and the univer&s;al ob&s;ervance of that golden rule, <HI>whatever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, de ye even &s;o unto them.</HI> It al&s;o requires truth and fidelity, in all our words, promi&s;es and contracts. And if the laws of religion were duly ob&s;erved, it would root out all tho&s;e vices and pa&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as hatred, malice, envy, revenge, covetou&s;ne&s;s, &amp;c. which render men un&s;ociable one to another, and trouble&s;ome to the &s;tate; and it would diffu&s;e a &s;pirit of love, beneficence, kindne&s;s, and chri&s;tian charity every where.&mdash;The&s;e are the proper, the&s;e are the ge|nuine fruits and effects of religion, and what the go&s;|pel tends to bring us to. Now, 'tis obvious, that if this
<PB N="20" REF="009955_0019_0F7B3F9AB1C86668">
be the de&s;ign of religion, viz. to &s;weeten men's tem|pers, to correct their pa&s;&s;ions, and to mortify all tho&s;e lu&s;ts which are the cau&s;es of enmity, of divi&s;ion, and of contention, in the world; then it tends, in its own nature, to the peace and happine&s;s of civil &s;ocie|ty; and if men would live as religion requires, the world would be in a quite different &s;tate from what it now is; every one would &s;it quietly under his own vine, and eat of the fruit of his own figtree. <Q>And, indeed, the true rea&s;on why the &s;ocieties of this world are &s;o full of tumult and di&s;order, is be|cau&s;e there is no more religion in them. And were the little remains of it once bani&s;hed, human &s;ociety would &s;oon di&s;band of it&s;elf, and run into confu&s;i|on; the earth would grow wild as a forre&s;t, and men, as bea&s;ts of prey, would devour and de&s;troy each other. Thus is religion apparently for the good and welfare of the &s;tate: Civil government can't &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it. Hence it will ever be the duty of rulers, to encourage and promote religion, &s;o long as civil &s;ociety and government &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the world.</Q></P>
<P>I add once more,</P>
<P N="3">3. That the great and un&s;peakable rewards which, in the life to come, will be be&s;towed upon &s;uch as promote and advance the Redeemer's kingdom in the world, &s;hould animate and encourage civil rulers to attempt it.&mdash;The happine&s;s of all good men will, I know, be great, un&s;peakably great in heaven; great, above what eye hath ever &s;een, ear heard of, or what hath ever entered into the heart of man to conceive. Yet there will be a difference among the &s;aints, the glory of one &s;hall be as the &s;un, another as the moon, and another as the &s;tars. St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, that <HI>As one &s;tar
<PB N="21" REF="009955_0020_0F7B3F9B47422F50">
differeth from another in glory; &s;o it &s;hall be in the re&s;ur|rection of the dead.</HI> Now the&s;e different degrees of glory will be proportioned out to good men&punc; accor|ding to their active diligence in the &s;ervice of GOD, and according as they have been more or le&s;s in&s;tru|mental, in promoting the cau&s;e of virtue and religi|on in the world. This may fairly be collected from the well-known parable of the talents, and al&s;o from that declaration of the prophet Daniel, that they who <HI>turn many to righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall &s;hine, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> barely as the brightne&s;s of the firmament, but with a di&s;tingu&s;hed lu&s;tre, as the &s;tars for ever and ever.</HI> Now, civil rulers are capacitated above mo&s;t other men, to do much for GOD, and much to promote religion in the world; their high and elevated &s;tations in life, give them many opportunities, and great advantages to do this. They are armed with power and authority to &s;uppre&s;s vice, and to encourage virtue: They can &s;upport and maintain religion, and give it countenance in the world: Their examples have an exten&s;ive influence, and are commonly imitated by many. In a word, if civil rulers are but properly di&s;po&s;ed, there are no men that can do more than they, to promote the REDEEMER's kingdom upon earth. While, on the other hand, if rulers oppo&s;e religion, or are only cold and indifferent towards it, and carele&s;s of its intere&s;ts; there are none that do &s;o much hurt:&mdash;And, &s;urely, this is a mighty argument, to encourage rulers to be nur&s;ing fathers to the church, that all their endea|vours &s;hall turn to a good account, to their own &s;ouls, and one day procure for them a more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Let me add further here, that the good effect of their pious labours may la&s;t a great many years after they are gone, and laid in the &s;ilent du&s;t. St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s excellent writings have been
<PB N="22" REF="009955_0021_0F7B3F9BC8954400">
the means of converting many, in every age of the church, and will be, till time &s;hall be no more: 'Tis probable, at lea&s;t, that every new conver&s;ion, occa|&s;ioned by his writings, adds a new gem unto his crown, and increa&s;es his already un&s;peakable weight of glory.&mdash;In like manner, tho&s;e civil rulers, who, by their wi&s;e and good regulations, have been the means of advancing the REDEEMER's kingdom in the world, will, I doubt not, find their own happine&s;s hereafter greatly encrea&s;ed, by every new acce&s;&s;ion thereunto, which they have been the means of.&mdash;And, &s;urely, the great and un&s;peakable felicities of hea|ven, &s;hould animate and encourage all men, men of influence and authority e&s;pecially, both in church and &s;tate, mo&s;t vigorou&s;ly to exert them&s;elves in the cau&s;e of CHRIST, and to endeavour to promote it in the world; &s;ince they know that their labour, in the LORD, &s;hall not be in vain: Far from this; and abun|dant, a glorious, an everla&s;ting recompence awaits them, at the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t.&mdash;</P>
<P>Much might be &s;aid, by way of improvement, and many u&s;eful inferences be deduced from the &s;ubject, would the time allow: But I mu&s;t omit every thing, of this kind, lea&s;t I be over tedious; and conclude, with an addre&s;s,</P>
<P N="1">1. To his honor the GOVERNOR, the DEPUTY-GOVERNOR, and the re&s;t of the members of the general a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>May it plea&s;e your HONORS.</P>
<P>Since I &s;tand in this place by his HONOR'S &s;pecial command, it won't, I tru&s;t, be thought too a&s;&s;uming,
<PB N="23" REF="009955_0022_0F7B3F9C77B24148">
on this occa&s;ion, for me to ob&s;erve, that as rulers of this people, you are bound, by a law &s;uperior to any human con&s;titutions, to be attentive, not only to their civil, but e&s;pecially to their religious intere&s;ts, and faithfully to endeavour to promote the &s;ame, accord|ing to the utmo&s;t of your power. Your honors' known characters, I am &s;en&s;ible, renders it, in a great mea&s;ure needle&s;s for me to enlarge upon this &s;ubject. However, as the intere&s;ts of religion are the mo&s;t important of all intere&s;ts, not only our temporal, but eternal wellfare depending upon them; you will in|dulge me a few words. Much, under GOD, depends upon your conduct; and we may naturally expect, that religion, in the colony, will either revive or lan|gui&s;h, as you bear a friendly or an unfriendly a&s;pect towards it. The hi&s;tory of the church, in general, in all ages, ju&s;tifies the truth of this ob&s;ervation. I well know, that GOD is able to defend his church, and cau&s;e the intere&s;t of it to flouri&s;h, in oppo&s;ition to all the powers of earth and darkne&s;s, as he did in the fir&s;t ages of chri&s;tianity; but this is not or|dinarily to be expected. GOD's u&s;ual method is to work by means, and one of the mo&s;t effectual means is to rai&s;e up good magi&s;trates, to protect and take care of his church. I am far from de&s;iring civil rulers to enforce religion, by acts of uniformity, by penal, and coercive laws; nor do I think the cau&s;e of truth was ever &s;erved by &s;uch methods. The rights of con&s;cience are &s;acred, they are unalienable rights. Every man ought to be left at liberty, to think and act for him&s;elf; nor do I believe any man &s;hould be re&s;trained on religious accounts, unle&s;s his prin|ciples or practi&s;es are &s;uch as give ju&s;t di&s;turbance to the &s;tate. As every man mu&s;t an&s;wer for him|&s;elf at the great and la&s;t day; &s;o every one ought
<PB N="24" REF="009955_0023_0F7B3F9D81C88718">
to be left at liberty to judge for him&s;elf here. Nor&punc; may the civil magi&s;trate deny him this, and be blame|le&s;s. However, there is a great deal rulers may do, to promote religion, without de&s;cending to the dirty work of per&s;ecution. They may protect it from the malice and in&s;ults of its enemies; they may &s;up|pre&s;s all immorality and vice, and encourage virtue and goodne&s;s: they may al&s;o, and they ought to e&s;tabli&s;h religion, and provide &s;uitable funds for the &s;upport and maintenance of it. This is a duty not only to GOD, but even to the &s;tate; it is the be&s;t, yea, it is the only &s;ecurity of civil government. I readily own, that every e&s;tabli&s;hment of a religious kind, &s;hould be upon the mo&s;t generous, catholic principles, and that no man, no &s;et of men &s;hould be excluded from the benefits of it, for mere &s;peculative, and im|material points, for different modes and ceremonies: it mu&s;t be &s;omething very material and weighty that excludes any. And the great unhappine&s;s in this ca&s;e has been, not that religious e&s;tabli&s;hments have been &s;et up in the world, but that they have gene|rally been founded upon too narrow, contracted and ungenerous principles. And magi&s;trates have too often gone into violent mea&s;ures, in &s;upport of them. However, I take it to be plain, that the civil intere&s;ts of mankind, the &s;afety of the &s;tate requires, that there be &s;ome religious e&s;tabli&s;hments, and that the public be obliged in &s;ome ju&s;t proportion, to &s;upport them; nor have di&s;&s;enters cau&s;e to complain of any little expences on this account, any more than of any other civil expences whatever: to be &s;ure, there is nothing of per&s;ecution in it; nor can the con&s;ci|ences of any be in the lea&s;t injured thereby, provi|ded they are not compelled to be of the religion of the &s;tate, and are allowed to wor&s;hip GOD, according
<PB N="25" REF="009955_0024_0F7B3F9E095651E0">
to the dictates of their own minds. This they have a right to expect; but they have no more right to a&s;k an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from contributing to the &s;upport of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the &s;tate, than from any other mea&s;ure the magi&s;trate takes for the public good, which they happen to di&s;like. The &s;upport of religion and the mini&s;ters of it, in a political view, is as much a civil tax, as the &s;upport of any other nece&s;&s;ary officers of the &s;tate. Where no public provi&s;ion is made for the&s;e purpo&s;es, but every man is left at liberty to do what is right in his own eyes; we can &s;carcely expect (&s;uch is the depraved condition of human nature) &s;o much as the form of religion to continue long among &s;uch a people. And where religion is bani&s;hed from a people, and the public exerci&s;es of it are not kept up, civil government &s;tands on a very &s;lippery foun|dation. Though 'tis too apparent that the princi|ples of religion have not that general influence up|on mankind that they ought to have, and which might naturally be expected, con&s;idering their infi|nite importance; yet di&s;regarded as they be, I am per&s;uaded that they have really a greater influence to deter men from vice, and to confine them within any bounds of order, than every other motive taken to|gether; and that if this fence about the &s;tate, were once taken away, if this &s;ecurity of civil government were removed, all would immediately run into con|fu&s;&s;ion, the reins could not be held, and no man could depend on the quiet enjoyment of life, liberty or property.</P>
<P>Suffer me here to query with your Honours, <HI>Whether our own laws in this colony, made for the &s;upport of re|ligion, don't need &s;ome very material amendments and al|terations?</HI> And if they be already &s;ufficient; <HI>whether
<PB N="26" REF="009955_0025_0F7B3F9F190FBDB0">
the con&s;truction put upon them, in many of our executive courts hath not a direct and natural tendency to under|mine and &s;ap the foundations of our eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titu|tion?</HI> To me, I confe&s;s; it appears, that as a tax laid on the polls and rateable e&s;tate of the inhabitants of the colony, is the only fund the law hath provided for the &s;upport of the mini&s;try; the relea&s;ing &s;uch numbers, as have on one account, and on another, been excu&s;ed from contributing to the &s;upport of the religion of the government is &s;uch a diminution of this fund, as hath a very threatning a&s;pect on our eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment, and natu|rally tends, not only to enervate and de&s;troy the &s;ame, but even to root out the very being of a learned mini&s;try from among us; and &s;o is big with ruin, both to church and &s;tate. And the danger, in my appre|hen&s;ion, is increa&s;ed from hence, that mo&s;t of the&s;e di&s;&s;enters are not by law obliged to &s;et up, and &s;up|port any religion among them&s;elves. And from principle they profe&s;s utterly to abandon and di&s;claim all covenants, all obligations of this kind. Con&s;ider|ing human nature as it is, and the difficult &s;i|tuation of the country at this day, is there no rea&s;on to fear, that many will for&s;ake our wor&s;hip, and our churches, only from narrow and contracted principles of mind? And GOD alone knows where the&s;e things will end&mdash;</P>
<P>But I go on to add, that civil rulers may, and ought to profe&s;s religion them&s;elves, and &s;et good examples of obedience to it. They &s;hould al&s;o endeavour to promote the intere&s;ts of religion, and to &s;pread it far and wide in the world. The&s;e things the civil ma|gi&s;trate may do, without per&s;ecution, and we ju&s;tly expect them from your honors. Our eyes are unto
<PB N="27" REF="009955_0026_0F7B3F9F774C95F0">
you for all due protection and defence, for all due en|couragement and &s;upport: you are to &s;et your&s;elves again&s;t vice, and to encourage virtue: you are to be terrors to evil-doers, and a prai&s;e to them that do well. And not only is it your duty to profe&s;s religi|on your&s;elves, and to &s;et good examples of obedience to it; but to u&s;e your power and influence to pro|mote the REDEEMER's kingdom in the world, and if po&s;&s;ible to extend it, even to the ends of the earth. A wide door is now opened for this purpo&s;e among the heathen natives&punc; of the land, and we &s;hall be in|excu&s;able, altogether inexcu&s;able in the eyes both of GOD and man, if we neglect it. One great rea&s;on, I doubt not, why the heathen have been permitted to be &s;uch &s;ore &s;courges to the&s;e chri&s;tian colonies, is, becau&s;e they have done no more to &s;end the go&s;pel among them. Many difficulties, I well know, great and almo&s;t in&s;urmountable difficulties have ever here|tofore attended this work; but by the &s;ucce&s;s of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> arms in <HI>America,</HI> and the late peace &s;o happily e&s;tabli&s;hed with the <HI>heathen natives,</HI> the greater part of them are removed out of the way. We have not tho&s;e pleas to make, in excu&s;e for our own neglect, that we once had, when the <HI>French</HI> were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greater part of the inland country, and were con|tinually &s;piriting up the <HI>Indians</HI> again&s;t us. And I confe&s;s for my part, I have but little hopes or ex|pectations of a &s;ettled peace with them, till we tho|roughly attempt to &s;end the go&s;pel among them. Nor do I expect ever to &s;ee a more favourable cri&s;is for this purppo&s;e than the pre&s;ent; con&s;idering the di&s;po&s;ition many of the&s;e nations have lately &s;hewn; their earne&s;t de&s;ire to be in&s;tructed in the principles of our holy religion, and to have their children educa|ted after the Engli&s;h method; it appears to me that the

mo&s;t favourable opportunity now pre&s;ents it&s;elf, to make &s;ome vigorous efforts of this kind, that we have ever had, or probably ever &s;hall have, if we neglect the pre&s;ent. Separate from all con&s;iderations of duty to our MAKER, and viewing the matter only in a political light, it appears to me, to be our real intere&s;t, to exert our&s;elves in this cau&s;e; becau&s;e this, if we conducted as we ought, would convince the <HI>Indians,</HI> that we were their real friends, and &s;ought their be&s;t good, and &s;o would naturally attach them to us, in the &s;tronge&s;t manner; and this would be a cheaper method of defence again&s;t their ravages and in&s;ults, than maintaining numerous armies and garri&s;ons. The <HI>French,</HI> who are allowed to be very able politicians, mo&s;t certainly acquired their influence over the <HI>Indians</HI> by this very means: Why may'nt we learn wi&s;dom, from their experience? It is but little, I know, that this colony in its pre&s;ent im|poveri&s;hed &s;tate, can do to this purpo&s;e; however, if we were well di&s;po&s;ed, we might do &s;omething&mdash;we could at lea&s;t ca&s;t in our mite into the trea&s;ury. This perhaps might be imitated by more oppulent and wealthy provinces, and even by the nation; to the great advancement of the REDEEMER's kingdom,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have often heard it remarked, that &s;carce ever a public prayer is put up in any of our wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;emblies in the coun|try, but that one petition to Almighty GOD, is to this purpo&s;e, "That he would open a door for &s;ending the go&s;pel among the heathen in the land." All our public proclamations, for days of fa&s;ting or thank&s;giving, contain exhortations to the &s;ame ef|fect. A &s;tranger to the hi&s;tory of the country would naturally conclude from thence, that many endeavours were every where con&s;tantly u&s;ed to promote this good work. And yet, when I come to review our hi&s;tory, I can &s;carce find any thing worthy to be remembered, &s;ince the days of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Eliott</HI> of <HI>Roxbury.</HI> The &s;urprizing &s;ucce&s;s he met with among the <HI>Natick Indians,</HI> ought, I think, to have been regarded, as a favourable omen, and to have encouraged other attempts. But the &s;pirit died with that good man. The only endeavour of this kind, that I know of, in the colony, at this day, is at <HI>Lebanon:</HI> The Rev. Mr. <HI>Wheelock,</HI> has &s;et up an Indian &s;chool there, and with indefati|gable indu&s;try and zeal, has collected a number of children, to be educated after the English manner, and in&s;tructed in the prin|ciples of the chri&s;tian religion. He has lately obtained &s;ome help, and a commi&s;&s;ion from the &s;ociety in <HI>Scotland,</HI> incorporating a number of gentlemen to act as corre&s;ponding members with them, for the purpo&s;e of promoting chri&s;tian knowledge among the <HI>Indians.</HI> But he has never yet obtained any con&s;iderable public encouragement from the government.&mdash;Some weighty objections, I am &s;en&s;ible, lie again&s;t that &s;chool, by rea&s;on of its remote &s;ituation from the Indian country, and the charge of tran&s;porting the children to and from it. I am not enough ac|quainted with Indian affairs, to determine what weight there may be in the objection. Some who profe&s;s to know more of the&s;e matters than I can pretend to, con&s;ider the di&s;tance from the <HI>Indian country,</HI> as being, upon the whole, rather an advantage than the contrary, becau&s;e the children are entirely removed from the &s;ociety of their &s;avage brethren. But however that be, the &s;cheme, in general is undoubtedly good. This, or &s;omething like it, ought mo&s;t certainly to be encouraged there, or el&s;e|where. And all orders and degrees of men, would do well to con&s;ider, whether public guilt don't lie upon the land, for our neglect in the&s;e matters?&mdash;</NOTE> of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> intere&s;t, and even of ours in this land.</P>

And next to the immediate care of religion, and as a means to promote it, the intere&s;ts of learning ought to be precious in your eyes. However, en|thu&s;ia&s;m may, 'tis not to be expected, that genuine religion will flouri&s;h, where learning is in a low and declining &s;tate. The <HI>Ottoman Porte</HI> hath been for ma|ny ages, &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this, that the principal means made u&s;e of by them to di&s;courage and root out chri&s;tianity from their dominions, hath been to di&s;|countenance learning. The church of <HI>Rome</HI> al&s;o ac|counts <HI>ignorance the mother of devotion;</HI> and the main &s;upport of her mon&s;trous &s;uper&s;tition and tyranny. But <HI>we have not thus learned Chri&s;t:</HI> Truth &s;eeks not darkne&s;s, but loves the light. We tru&s;t, honoured
<PB N="30" REF="009955_0029_0F7B3FA333E27880">
fathers, that you are friendly to learning, and will give it all due encouragement and &s;upport. Our <HI>Col|lege,</HI> which hath been, and now is &s;o much our glo|ry, as an elder child, claims your fir&s;t and your prin|cipal attention and care. You are the FATHERS, you are the FOUNDERS of that &s;ociety; and you have nouri&s;hed and maintained it at a great expence. We doubt not your &s;miles, and the continuance of for|mer favours to that u&s;eful &s;eminary. And though it is a time of great public di&s;tre&s;s, yet you will allow us to tru&s;t, that if any thing further be nece&s;&s;ary, to the well-being of that &s;chool, you will chearfully ad|vance it, to the utmo&s;t of your power, and account it money well expended, and even let out on the highe&s;t intere&s;t.&mdash;And, next to the college, our <HI>inferior &s;chools of learning,</HI> ought to be the objects of your care. That the&s;e be &s;uitably maintained, and our youth early in&s;tructed in u&s;eful learning, is a matter of very great importance, both to church and &s;tate; and yet many, if not mo&s;t of them, through|out the colony, are &s;o managed, as but illy to an&s;wer the good ends of their original in&s;titution. Regard to the ri&s;ing generation, yea, to children yet unborn, demands your attention to this, and &s;ome effectual remedy.&mdash;But I may'nt go on multiplying parti|culars; your honours' better acquaintance with pub|lic affairs, and clo&s;er attention to them, will natu|rally point out what is ami&s;s, and needs a remedy; and we doubt not your readine&s;s to promote the be&s;t good of this people, temporal and eternal. Your duty to GOD, your duty to the &s;tate, yea, your duty to your own &s;ouls, require this. I am &s;en&s;ible, 'tis an arduous work you are called to; and that many trials and difficulties attend your high &s;tation, e&s;pe|cially at this day. But for your encouragement, re|member

a great and glorious reward is &s;et before you. Di&s;tingui&s;hed honor, if you are faithful, will be your portion in this life, and everla&s;ting happine&s;s in the next. And you &s;hall not only, like other men, &s;hine as the brightne&s;s of the firmament, but with a &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing lu&s;tre as the &s;tars forever and ever. Suffer me,</P>
<P N="2">2. To addre&s;s my&s;elf to my fathers and brethren in the mini&s;try, here pre&s;ent,</P>
<P>Rev'd Sirs,</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory informs us, that there hath often been times, &s;ince CHRIST hath had a church in the world, when his faithful mini&s;ters have been obliged to &s;trug|gle not only again&s;t all the prejudices of mankind, and all the oppo&s;ition of the powers of darkne&s;s, but again&s;t the power of civil rulers too. They have &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t the church, per&s;ecuted it with un|relenting rage; and &s;aid of <HI>Jeru&s;alem, Let us ra&s;e it, let us ra&s;e it, even to the foundations thereof.</HI> Many were the difficulties, and &s;evere the trials the faithful mini&s;ters of CHRIST underwent, at the&s;e times. Through the goodne&s;s of GOD, our happy lot and portion is to be born under different circum&s;tances, and we live in a land of go&s;pel liberty and light: Our rulers, in&s;tead of per&s;ecuting, are forward to exert them&s;elves, in the cau&s;e of CHRIST, and to afford us all due encouragement and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Let us, who wait at the altar, heartily join with them, in promo|ting the &s;ame good work. Our &s;pecial bu&s;ine&s;s is to be mini&s;ters of religion; and our great concern &s;hould be to advance the REDEEMER's kingdom in the world: We can take no method, more effectual or likely to do this, than by encouraging the hearts,
<PB N="32" REF="009955_0031_0F7B3FA3F955D758">
and &s;trengthening the hands of our rulers. If we who look for protection and &s;upport from them, are mutinous and contentious our&s;elves, and &s;tir up &s;e|dition, both in church and &s;tate; we cannot expect favour, either from GOD, or from the king. 'Tis our duty not only to pray for our rulers, but to do what we can, to make the reins of government lie ea&s;y on the people's necks. Our ble&s;&s;ed LORD and MASTER was not only quiet and inoffen&s;ive towards all, but friendly to civil government, and he taught his di&s;ciples to be &s;o too. Let us take his word for our rule, and him for our pattern and example, in this regard. The hi&s;tory of the church, in all ages &s;hews, that when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> walk hand in hand, things go well: But when the mini&s;ters of the &s;tate, and of the church, differ and di&s;agree, all things run into confu&s;ion. Let us &s;ee to it, that we, on our part, give none occa&s;ion of divi&s;ion. If our rulers &s;ee us diligent and laborious in our work, quiet and peaceable towards government, and inoffen&s;ive to|wards all men, minding our own bu&s;ine&s;s, and faith|fully labouring to win &s;ouls to CHRIST; then may we expect their friendly &s;miles, their protection, and chearful &s;upport: While a contrary conduct and de|meanour will naturally draw down a contrary treat|ment. In all things let us &s;hew our&s;elves examples, in faith, in purity, in holine&s;s, in love and in charity: Then may we hope for the &s;miles of heaven, the fa|vour of the prince, and that great, very great will be our &s;ucce&s;s in our Ma&s;ter's work, that religion will revive and flouri&s;h, and the church become <HI>fair as the moon, clear as the &s;un, and terrible as an army with banners.</HI> And that all nations will fly to it and be &s;a|ved. But, if after all, our labours &s;hould not be at|tended with the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s, yet we our&s;elves, &s;hall
<PB N="33" REF="009955_0032_0F7B3FA4B5B1FCA8">
be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and with GOD &s;hall be our reward.</P>
<P>I clo&s;e all, with a few words,</P>
<P N="3">3. To this numerous a&s;&s;embly here pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It is undoubtedly, my brethren, the la&s;t time we &s;hall all meet again, 'til we meet together at the grand, deci&s;ive day of reckoning, before the tribunal of the LORD JESUS, the judge of all fle&s;h. Suffer then, a word of exhortation: And let me earne&s;tly intreat you to join with your rulers and with your mini&s;ters, in the great work of promoting religion in the world, and enlarging the REDEEMER's church and kingdom. Tho' men in public place and character, are under peculiar obligations unto this, yet 'tis a duty, in &s;ome mea&s;ure in common, incumbent on all. Every one, in his proper place and &s;tation, &s;hould endeavour to be aiding therein. There is &s;omething that all may do. Let me urge it upon you, that you be not wanting, on your parts. To that end, let every man be per&s;waded to break off his own &s;ins by repentance, and his iniquities by turning unto the LORD. Hear|tily profe&s;s the religion of CHRIST; give up your|&s;elves to him by faith, and live lives of obedience to his holy laws. Your pre&s;ent peace here, and your everla&s;ting welfare hereafter, depend upon this.&mdash;And having made your peace with GOD, and &s;o &s;ecured the eternal &s;afety of your own &s;ouls; let it be your next endeavour, to promote a general reformation a|mong your neighbours. Every man, in his own &s;phere, &s;hould exert him&s;elf: None are &s;o low as to &s;tand excu&s;ed. The meane&s;t may do &s;omething to promote this work. The widow's mite &s;hould be
<PB N="34" REF="009955_0033_0F7B3FA7F5FA4C60">
ca&s;t in. And GOD may ble&s;s the weake&s;t means, and cau&s;e them to produce great effects.&mdash;Great matters &s;ometimes &s;pring from &s;mall beginnings. <HI>A little &s;park kindleth a great fire.</HI> Religion may &s;pread from one man, from one family and neighbour to another, till at length it run through the town, through the colony, through the land and nation; and may at la&s;t, cover the earth, as the waters do the &s;eas. And oh! how happy will it be for us in the day of reckoning, if we are found faithful, and appear to be the in&s;tru|ments GOD hath cho&s;en, to &s;et up and enlarge the REDEEMER's kingdom in the world, more generally than ever yet it hath been! Very glorious, in that ca&s;e, will be our recompence of reward.</P>
<P>Come, LORD JESUS, come quickly. Take to thy&s;elf thy great power, and rule and reign, from the ri&s;ing to the &s;etting &s;un. Let every knee bow to thee, and every tongue confe&s;s thy prai&s;es.</P>
