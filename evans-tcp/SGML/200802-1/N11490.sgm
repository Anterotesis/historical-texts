<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT To the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE following Elegy was first published in one of the Boston Gazettes, about the middle of last September. It was adapted to the circumstances of the times at that period, and calculated to promote that Spirit of Liberty, Industry and Oeconomy, recommended by the Grand Congress, then sitting at Philadel|phia. Notwithstanding some alte|rations in the state of our public af|fairs, by which the sentiments and advice in some parts of it are become superfluous, its general tenor, which no change in our fortune can render improper, and its poetical merit, made it worthy, in our opinion, of a second publication.</HI></P>

<LG>
<L>OH BOSTON! late with ev'ry pleasure crown'd,</L>
<L>Where Commerce triumph'd on the fav'ring gales,</L>
<L>And each pleas'd eye, that rov'd in prospect round,</L>
<L>Hail'd thy bright spires and bless'd thy op'ning sails!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy plenteous marts with rich profusion smil'd;</L>
<L>The gay throng crouded in thy spacious streets;</L>
<L>From either <HI>Ind</HI> thy chearful stores were fill'd;</L>
<L>Thy ports were gladden'd with unnumber'd fleets.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For there more fair than in their native vales,</L>
<L>Tall groves of masts arose in beauteous pride;</L>
<L>The waves were whiten'd by the swelling sails,</L>
<L>And plenty wafted on the neighb'ring tide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Alas, how chang'd! the swelling sails no more</L>
<L>Catch the fair winds and wanton in the sky;</L>
<L>But hostile beaks affright the guarded shore,</L>
<L>And pointed thunders all access deny.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where the bold Cape its warning forehead rears,</L>
<L>Where tyrant Vengeance waved her magic wand,</L>
<L>Far from the sight each friendly vessel veers,</L>
<L>Calls the kind gales and flies the fatal strand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The ruin'd Merchant turns his mournful eyes</L>
<L>From the drear shore and desolated way;</L>
<L>Thy silent marts unusual glooms surprize,</L>
<L>And through thy streets the sons of rapine stray.</L>

<L>On Freedom's shrines th' unhallow'd vengeance bend?</L>
