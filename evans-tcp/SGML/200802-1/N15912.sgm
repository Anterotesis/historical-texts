<HEAD>THE REMARKABLE HISTORY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THIS very fortunate young Man, when only a few days old, was put fa&s;t a&s;leep into Mr. All|worthy's bed, on the &s;ame night that gentleman re|turned from London, to his Country Hou&s;e, which was about a mile from Bath&mdash;
<PB N="6" REF="020356_0004_0FAEFADE9960FA90">
Mr. Allworthy came home late in the evening, and af|ter a &s;hort &s;upper with his &s;i&s;ter, retired, much fatigued to his chamber: Here, after having &s;pent &s;ome Minutes on his knees, a cu&s;tom which he never broke thro' on any account, he was preparing to &s;tep into bed, when, on opening the clothes, to his great &s;urpri&s;e, he beheld the Infant, wrapt up in &s;ome coar&s;e linen, in a &s;weet and profound &s;leep,
<PB N="7" REF="020356_0005_0FAEFADF10BC6898">
between his &s;heets; he &s;tood &s;ome time lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;h|ment at the &s;ight, but as good nature had always an a&s;cendancy in his mind, he was &s;oon touched with &s;en|timents of compa&s;&s;ion for the little wretch before him, and rang the bell, which called up his hou&s;ekeeper, Mrs. Deborah Wilkins.&mdash;She being a &s;trict ob&s;erver of decency, was exceedingly alarmed, on entering her ma&s;ter's room, to find him
<PB N="8" REF="020356_0006_0FAEFAE02E9FCE68">
undre&s;&s;ed, but more &s;o on his pre&s;enting her with the child, which he ordered im|mediately to be taken care of; although &s;he took the liberty to advi&s;e him to have it placed at the Church-Warden's door; "It is a goodly night, &s;ays &s;he, only a little rainy and windy, but if it is well wrapt up, and put into a warm ba&s;ket, it is two to one but he lives until he is found in the morning."
<PB N="9" REF="020356_0007_0FAEFAE0A7B85D90">
This goodly advice of his hou&s;ekeeper, it is mo&s;t pro|bable Mr Allworthy did not hear, for by this time he had got one of his fingers in the infant's hand, which by its gentle pre&s;&s;ure, &s;eem|ed to implore his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Some months after, his &s;i&s;ter, Mrs. Blifill, brought him a nephew, and Mr. Allworthy gave the nur&s;e &s;trict orders to bring them up together, and not make the lea&s;t di&s;tinction be|tween
<PB N="10" REF="020356_0008_0FAEFAE1B1D47070">
the two boys; and was often heard to &s;ay, if Tommy turned out good, he would be as a father to him, and as he was very rich it was greatly in his power to be &s;o. But tho' his goodne&s;s pre&s;erved the poor orphan, he was exceeding angry with the per&s;on who placed him in his bed, and cau&s;ed the mo&s;t diligent &s;earch to be made, in order to find the party; declaring, if he
<PB N="11" REF="020356_0009_0FAEFAE20B11D8D8">
found them out he would immediately commit them to pri&s;on, which, as a ju&s;|tice of the peace, it was in his power to do; but the &s;earch was fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>Nothing material hap|pened re&s;pecting Ma&s;ter Bli|fill and Ma&s;ter Jones, of con&s;equence &s;ufficient for a place in this hi&s;tory, until they were about eight years of age. But before I proceed, it is, I think, nece&s;|&s;ary to inform the reader,
<PB N="12" REF="020356_0010_0FAEFAE4F777FF38">
why he took upon him the name of Jones, it was cau&s;|ed, I am told, from a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion, that one Molly Jones (&s;ervant to Mr. Par|tridge, a &s;choolma&s;ter in the neighbourhood) was the per&s;on who put him into Mr. Allworthy's bed; &s;he left her place about that time and making nobody acquainted where &s;he was gone to, was in mo&s;t peo|ple's opinion, grounds &s;uffi|cient to conclude her the
<PB N="13" REF="020356_0011_0FAEFAE60732C9E8">
per&s;on; &s;o all agreed, that Jones &s;hould be the name of the boy. I wi&s;h it was in my power as <HI>clearly</HI> to account for his chri&s;tian name, there hi&s;tory is &s;hamefully deficient. But I will detain you no lon|ger with digre&s;&s;ions, for in my opinion it is but of lit|tle moment; tho' &s;ome very learned men have taken the pains to write folio volumes on &s;ubjects more trivial than even what cau&s;|ed
<PB N="14" REF="020356_0012_0FAEFAE6F77E0248">
Jones to be named Tom.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved, that nothing material happened till they were eight years old, at that time 'Squire We&s;tern, a Gentleman who lived about a mile di&s;tant, invited Mr. Allworthy to take a dinner with him, and bring along his two ne|phews (for by that name did he &s;uffer the poor help|le&s;s orphan to be called) they all had made a hearty
<PB N="15" REF="020356_0013_0FAEFAE751AF1598">
dinner, and Mr. We&s;tern returned thanks to Al|mighty God for the &s;ame, when he told Ma&s;ter Bli|fill and Ma&s;ter Jones, they might go and play together, if it was agreeable to Mr. Allworthy; the good man readily con&s;ented. They had been but a very little time at play, when Mi&s;s Sophy, Mr. We&s;tern's only child, a girl about their own age, made a third, and &s;he being willing, like
<PB N="16" REF="020356_0014_0FAEFAE80CA45FB8">
a good &s;oul, to divert them all in her power, &s;aid, &s;he had a Goldfinch in the hou&s;e quite tame, which &s;he had brought up her|&s;elf from a week old, and was very fond of, and if they cho&s;e &s;he would bring it into the garden, to &s;hew them. Here &s;he is with a bit of &s;tring tied round the bird's leg.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="020356_0015_0FAEFAE8E8888A88">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The two lads were migh|tily plea&s;ed with the bird; and after admiring him &s;ome time, Ma&s;ter Blifil begged Sophy would let him hold the &s;tring him&s;elf;
<PB N="18" REF="020356_0016_0FAEFAE9970E9298">
&s;he was, however, very un|willing to part with it, but as he pledged his word and honour, he would return the bird to her as &s;afe as he received it, &s;he could then no longer object; but the in&s;tant &s;he put the bird in his hands he &s;lipt the &s;tring from his leg and away he flew. Little Jones was extremely angry with Ma&s;ter Blifill for behaving &s;o, and &s;orry for poor little Sophy, who &s;tood crying
<PB N="19" REF="020356_0017_0FAEFAEA4E103840">
for the lo&s;s of her favourite bird. Tom ob&s;erved where he flew, off goes his clothes, he climbs the tree, and puts his hand on the poor little trembling tame creature, &amp; pre&s;ents it to Mi&s;s Sophy.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="020356_0018_0FAEFAEB65D7AEE0">
You cannot imagine how much little Jones gained Sophy's good will for recovering her bird, and how much Ma&s;ter Blifill had di&s;plea&s;ed her by his behaviour. The moment Mr. We&s;tern was informed how Blifill had &s;erved his little darling's bird, he &s;aid that if Blifill was not flog|ged for it on his return home, he would never &s;peak to Mr. Allworthy again; to this Mr. Allworthy rea|dily
<PB N="21" REF="020356_0019_0FAEFAEBCCC3CE98">
agreed, for he was as much di&s;plea&s;ed with Ma&s;|ter Blifill as Mr. We&s;tern could be.</P>
<P>Tom's generous di&s;po&s;i|tion in recovering the bird, made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on Sophy, and as they grew up together, and continued neighbours, he had frequent opportunities of exerting him&s;elf in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mi&s;s We&s;tern. One time &s;he had been taking a ride on a young &s;pirited hor&s;e,
<PB N="22" REF="020356_0020_0FAEFAECC866F488">
who threw her off, and, if Jones had not been near and caught her in his arms,
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
it is mo&s;t likely the fall would have broke her neck; by &s;aving her, he broke his
<PB N="23" REF="020356_0021_0FAEFAED4B712360">
own arm, "but, &s;aid he, if I have pre&s;erved you, Mi&s;s Sophy, I am &s;ufficiently re|paid, for I promi&s;e you, I would have &s;ecured you from the lea&s;t harm at the expence of a much greater misfortune to my&s;elf than I have &s;uffered on the occa|&s;ion."</P>
<P>When Mr. We&s;tern was informed that Mr. Jones had &s;aved his daughter's life, he was in raptures, and po&s;itively declared, that if
<PB N="24" REF="020356_0022_0FAEFAF05089E6E8">
both the parties were wil|ling, they &s;hould go through the world together, and that he would give Sophy to him in marriage with twenty thou&s;and pounds. They both cheerfully con|&s;ented to this offer, and a day was fixed for the wed|ding: This was joy indeed to Mr. Allworthy, for you mu&s;t recollect his u&s;ual &s;ay|ing, "I will be as a father to him, if he turns out a good boy;" and &s;o he was,
<PB N="25" REF="020356_0023_0FAEFAF1563D1998">
for on the wedding day, he gave Mr. Jones exactly the &s;ame &s;um of money, as Mr. We&s;tern gave to Sophy, &s;o that their fortunes were equal.

They now ride about the country in their coach and &s;ix, the happie&s;t couple I believe, in the world, and often joke with each other about the recovery of the Goldfinch. They take plea&s;ure in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and have the prayers of all the poor folks in the country; on the con|trary, Blifill having of|fended his uncle a great many times, and made every per&s;on he was
<PB N="27" REF="020356_0025_0FAEFAF353747FD0">
acquainted with, di&s;like him, was at la&s;t turned out of Mr. Allworthy's hou&s;e, and on the point of inli&s;t|ing as a common &s;oldier for Africa.

<PB N="28" REF="020356_0026_0FAEFAF41955B7C0">
When Mr. Jones hear|ing of his di&s;tre&s;s, gener|ou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on his ac|cepting Fifty Pounds a year for his Life; for al|though Mr. Jones was in|timately acquainted with the many fal&s;hoods Blifill had told his uncle, with an intent to injure him in that good man's opinion, yet he was of &s;o good and forgiving a di&s;po&s;ition, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;ee a per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s
<PB N="29" REF="020356_0027_0FAEFAF4CB418BC8">
and not afford him &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance; e&s;pecially one he had been brought up with from a child, and who would have been heir to Mr. Allworthy's great e&s;tate, had not his own unhappy vicious di&s;|po&s;ition prevented it.</P>

<L><HI>For vice will always be detected,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And virtue ever be protected.</HI></L>

<P>If this true Hi&s;tory, my little friends, makes the im|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="30" REF="020356_0028_0FAEFAF721CBAC20">
on your minds which I intend it &s;hould, I &s;hall then have no rea&s;on to lament the pains I have taken to collect the mate|rials which form it. I was born and brought up in the &s;ame pari&s;h with both the lads, Jones's heart was generous and good, and glad was I to find Mr. All|worthy had under&s;tanding enough to di&s;cover it thro' the clouds of imprudence with which it was &s;ur|rounded;
<PB N="31" REF="020356_0029_0FAEFAF927208290">
but believe me, let your di&s;po&s;ition be ever &s;o good, it is a thou&s;and to one you meet with &s;uch a friend to protect you, as Jones found in Mr. All|worthy. Therefore in a word, reader, let me advi&s;e you to be particularly care|ful, that none of your games at play be &s;uch as will in|jure or offend any of your neighbours.</P>
