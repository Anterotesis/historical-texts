<Q><BIBL><HI>1. THESSALONIANS, III, 8.</HI></BIBL>
<P>FOR NOW WE LIVE, IF YE STAND FAST IN THE LORD.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s of a people in religion, is the life and happine&s;s of their Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>This is the &s;entiment here expre&s;&s;ed&mdash;a &s;entiment which every good Mini&s;ter can realize. His relation to his people commences with a peculiar regard &amp; friend|&s;hip. Long acquaintance and uninterrupted harmony with them, continued labours for them, and repeated kindne&s;&s;es from them, their candid acceptance of his Mini&s;try, and his hope that it has been u&s;eful among them, will all contribute to &s;trengthen the attachment. When age or infirmity &s;hall lead him to contemplate the approaching di&s;&s;olution of his connection, he will feel a new concern, le&s;t they turn away from the truth; and an ardent de&s;ire, that they may be more e&s;tabli&s;hed in the faith, as they have been taught. Under the de|cays of bodily &s;trength, and in the pro&s;pect of his final remove, he can &s;ay, 'Now I live, if ye &s;tand fa&s;t in the Lord.'</P>
<P>Your own Mini&s;ter, my brethren, is not wholly a &s;tranger to &s;uch feelings, as have been de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><HI>The pre&s;ent year</HI> completes a century, &s;ince a Reli|gious
<PB N="6" REF="032362_0004_0FF1F22F0CE0A950">
Society was formed in this place. And <HI>this day</HI> completes the fortieth year, &s;ince my relation to you commenced. My Mini&s;try has been twice as long, as that of your fir&s;t Pa&s;tor; and almo&s;t five years longer, than that of my immediate predece&s;&s;or. The <HI>day</HI> re|minds us of the relation &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between us: The <HI>length</HI> of <HI>time,</HI> which this relation has continued, re|minds us, that its di&s;&s;olution is at hand.</P>
<P>Your pre&s;ent attendance in the hou&s;e of God I have reque&s;ted, that I might addre&s;s you, on &s;ome important matters, under the impre&s;&s;ion, which the <HI>day</HI> will natu|rally make on <HI>your</HI> minds, as well as <HI>my own.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of my exhortation will be that, which the text and the &s;ea&s;on &s;ugge&s;t, "Stand fa&s;t in the Lord.'</P>
<P>I &s;hall illu&s;trate the words in applying them to you.</P>
<P N="1">1. Stand fa&s;t in the <HI>faith</HI> of the Go&s;pel; and repel, with indignation, every attempt to &s;educe you from it.</P>
<P>If you believe there is a God who governs the world, and men are accountable creatures, then you believe there is &s;uch a thing as religion. And if there is any &s;uch thing, it mu&s;t be that which you find in the Go&s;pel. Here every vice is forbidden, and every virtue inculca|ted. Here the mo&s;t powerful arguments are propo&s;ed, and the mo&s;t effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tances offered, to recommend and encourage a virtuous life. And here the mo&s;t gracious provi&s;ion is made to bring the guilty into a &s;tate of pardon, and revive their de&s;ponding hopes.
<PB N="7" REF="032362_0005_0FF1F23327368360">
Whoever, therefore, makes light of the Go&s;pel, re|jects, in &s;ub&s;tance, all religion: He leaves no ground on which his hope can &s;ecurely &s;tand, and no informa|tion on which his faith can rationally depend. If he di&s;cards the idea of religion, he renounces his rationali|ty, and takes rank among the brutes. If he frames to him&s;elf a religion, different from that taught by revela|tion, thus far it mu&s;t be irrational and ab&s;urd; neither con&s;i&s;tent with the character of God, nor adapted to the condition of man.</P>
<P>The hone&s;t and upright man, who doubts the divini|ty of the Go&s;pel, will carefully examine its evidences, and promptly yield to the conviction which they bring. Before he ventures to reject the Saviour propo&s;ed, he will take time to an&s;wer this que&s;tion, 'To whom &s;hall I go?' What better way of pardon &s;hall I find&mdash;what better &s;y&s;tem of virtue &s;hall I contrive, than that which the Go&s;pel reveals? The &s;erious examination of this que&s;tion will certainly lead him to a humble acqui|e&s;cence in the chri&s;tian &s;cheme.</P>
<P>If the Go&s;pel is divine and important, unbelief mu&s;t involve us in awful guilt. The Saviour &s;ays, 'If ye believe not that I am he, ye &s;hall die in your &s;ins.' 'Take heed, therefore, le&s;t there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God: But exhort one another daily, le&s;t any be hardened through the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in.'</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="032362_0006_0FF1F234E22689D8">This is a day, when <HI>dei&s;m,</HI> and the errors which lead to it, appear more openly, than they have u&s;ually done. The errors mo&s;t remarkably tending to infidelity are <HI>univer&s;ali&s;m, fatali&s;m,</HI> and <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Univer&s;ali&s;m,</HI> or the denial of future puni&s;hment, relaxes the morality of the Go&s;pel, and gives the reins to every lu&s;t. <HI>Fatali&s;m,</HI> or the doctrine that the voli|tions and actions of men, whether good or bad, are all preci&s;ely fixed and determined by an eternal and uncon|trolable nece&s;&s;ity, takes away all &s;en&s;e of accountable|ne&s;s, and opens wide the door to vice and licentiou&s;|ne&s;s. <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> or a reliance on imaginary revela|tions, made either to our&s;elves, or to other people, &s;u|per&s;edes and &s;ets a&s;ide the revelation which God has given us in the Go&s;pel. Thus they all eventually lead to, and u&s;ually terminate in total infidelity.</P>
<P>The open, undi&s;gui&s;ed appearance of infidelity in the pre&s;ent day is a con&s;equence of tho&s;e political convul|&s;ions and revolutions, which have agitated the world, &amp; e&s;pecially this part of it. A &s;pirit of liberty awakens enquiry, and emboldens an avowal of &s;entiments, which once were &s;tudiou&s;ly concealed. When enquiry is rou&s;ed, it makes many u&s;eful di&s;coveries: but it will often run to exce&s;s. There is, in &s;ome minds, a certain vanity, which affects to di&s;card common opinions, in order to di&s;play a &s;uperiority of genius. Free enquiry is, on the whole, favourable to truth; but its fir&s;t ef|forts often produce temporary errors and confu&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="032362_0007_0FF1F23A97C55F78">The imigration of foreigners, which is a natural con|&s;equence of our national pro&s;perity, and of the pre&s;ent convul&s;ions in Europe, will be attended with real dan|ger to the purity of religion. Many of the&s;e foreigners, being men of di&s;tingui&s;hed education and fortune, as well as of licentious principles and manners, will in|troduce and di&s;&s;eminate among us the vices and errors of their own country. And libertine &s;entiments are &s;o congenial to the corruptions of the heart, &s;o &s;latter|ing to human pride, and &s;o plea&s;ing to the natural love of novelty, that they ea&s;ily gain credit and prevail.</P>
<P>As this is a day of danger, he watchful, le&s;t you hear the in&s;tructions, which cau&s;e to err from the words of knowledge. Let your minds be impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of the va&s;t importance of religion. Examine and judge for your&s;elves, what religion is. And &s;ee that its real temper be wrought in your hearts.</P>
<P>When a new &s;entiment is offered to you, enquire, what is its natural influence&mdash;whether it encourages virtue, or only emboldens vice&mdash;whether it leads to re|pentance of &s;in and amendment of life, or only pacifies con&s;cious guilt&mdash;whether it would make you better men, or rather &s;et you loo&s;e from the obligations of mo|rality: Never embrace an opinion, which would cor|rupt your manners, or defeat the pure and benevolent influence of the Go&s;pel. Remember that religion is a matter on which depends the happine&s;s of man in his private, and in his &s;ocial capacity&mdash;in the pre&s;ent, and
<PB REF="032362_0008_0FF1F2406A6C5618">
in the future life; and let your regards to it be govern|ed, not by the examples and opinions of men, but by the &s;ober dictates of rea&s;on, and the plain in&s;tructions of revelation.</P>
<P N="2">2. As you would &s;tand fa&s;t in the Lord, you mu&s;t maintain a chri&s;tian <HI>profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and &s;upport the honour of it by a <HI>corre&s;pondent</HI> life.</P>
<P>It is no uncommon thing, that per&s;ons when they are called upon to enter into the church of God, plead in excu&s;e for their neglect, that the members of the church are as loo&s;e and ungodly as many others. And they a&s;k, 'Why &s;hould we join our&s;elves to &s;uch a &s;o|ciety, when its members differ little, or nothing from the men of the world?'</P>
<P>This is, indeed, an in&s;ufficient excu&s;e. The obliga|tions of religion lie on all, to whom the Go&s;pel comes. They ari&s;e not from a voluntary profe&s;&s;ion, but from the command of God. If one &s;ees corruptions in a church, this is not a rea&s;on, why he &s;hould turn away from it, and leave the corruptions to prevail; but ra|ther a rea&s;on, why he &s;hould join him&s;elf to it and co|operate with his brethren to rectify what is ami&s;s. It is, however, a known fact, that the loo&s;e conver&s;ation of profe&s;&s;ors di&s;credits religion and ob&s;tructs the growth of the church. Chri&s;tians are therefore to be blame|le&s;s, the &s;ons God without rebuke in the mid&s;t of a
<PB N="11" REF="032362_0009_0FF1F24626DACED0">
perver&s;e nation, &s;hining as lights in the world, and hold|ing forth the word of life.</P>
<P>Walk, my brethen, as men bound for another world&mdash;as men &s;eeking a better country. If you are ab&s;orbed in the cares, addicted to the plea&s;ures, and conformed to the manners of this world, will it be thought, that there is any &s;incerity in your profe&s;&s;ion? Will not your exam|ple corrupt the manners of many around you? The Apo&s;tle &s;peaks&mdash;and he &s;peaks with tears&mdash;concerning &s;ome, who &s;o walk that they are enemies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>When I &s;peak to the profe&s;&s;ors of religion, I mean to comprehend all, who, in any way, declare their be|lief of the Go&s;pel; yea, all who have been con&s;ecrated to God. You ought to regard your bapti&s;m as a &s;eal of your covenant obligations, unle&s;s you mean to re|nounce it. And if you renounce this, what do you le&s;s than renounce the Saviour?&mdash;Bapti&s;m is into Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The Go&s;pel has come to you. You either believe, or di&s;believe it. If you believe it, then profe&s;s it, and live agreeably to it. If you mean to reject it, beware le&s;t that come upon you, which is written in the Pro|phets; 'Behold, ye de&s;pi&s;ers, and wander and peri&s;h.'</P>
<P N="3">3. To &s;tand fa&s;t in the Lord, is to maintain the <HI>pow|er</HI> of his religion.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome, who have but a &s;uperficial religion.
<PB N="12" REF="032362_0010_0FF1F249A63BEB08">
They are not willing that the form of godline&s;s &s;hould be di&s;continued in the world, nor do they intend to re|nounce it them&s;elves. But they choo&s;e to make their religion an ea&s;y pliant thing, which may comport with their intere&s;ts and humours, and will not impo&s;e too great re&s;traints. Hence they are carried about with divers and &s;trange doctrines. They follow every new &s;ect, hoping to find &s;omething which will plea&s;e their imagination, and pacify their con&s;cience. They are ever learning, but never &s;ettled in the belief of the truth.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome, who flatter them&s;elves, that it is no great matter, what a man believes, if he only acts a|greeably to his belief&mdash;that great &s;trictne&s;s in morals is not required, or may be di&s;pen&s;ed with, where there is a regular attendance on forms, and a warmth of affec|tion in devotional exerci&s;es. Thus they put the means in the place of the end.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome, who excu&s;e the corruptions of their heart, and their acquired habits of vice, under the &s;oft and gentle name of natural de&s;ires. And they ima|gine, God will never condemn them for following tho&s;e propen&s;ities, which he has put in them as a part of their con&s;titution. Thus, by making their own lu&s;ts and humours, the &s;tandard by which to judge of virtue and vice, they form to them&s;elves a licentious religion, which tolerates their iniquities, and calms
<PB N="13" REF="032362_0011_0FF1F24B6CECA7F8">
their fears. They explain away the &s;ub&s;tance, and leave only the &s;hadow; and under this they &s;it with a fal&s;e delight.</P>
<P>Beware that you indulge no &s;uch delu&s;ive &s;entiments. If religion was de&s;igned to prepare you for heavenly happine&s;s, it mu&s;t form you to a temper capable of that happine&s;s. As that con&s;i&s;ts in the enjoyment of God, religion mu&s;t transform you into the image of God.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve the &s;tated exerci&s;es of &s;ecret religion, &s;uch as &s;elf-examination, meditation and prayer. If the&s;e are thrown a&s;ide, you cannot experience the real power of godline&s;s. This con&s;i&s;ts in pious regards to God, and fixed re&s;olutions for his &s;ervice, which can be main|tained only by intercour&s;e with him, and conver&s;e with your&s;elves.</P>
<P N="4">4. A faithful attendance on the <HI>ordinances</HI> of the Go&s;pel is implied in your &s;tanding fa&s;t in the Lord.</P>
<P>Thus the Apo&s;tle teaches us: 'Having liberty,' &s;ays he, 'to enter into the holie&s;t by the blood of Je&s;us, let us draw near with a true heart, in the full a&s;&s;urance of faith&mdash;Let us hold fa&s;t the profe&s;&s;ion of our faith with|out wavering&mdash;Let us con&s;ider one another to provoke unto love and good works, not for&s;aking the a&s;&s;embling of our&s;elves together.'</P>
<P>The ordinances, which God has in&s;tituted, are high|ly
<PB N="14" REF="032362_0012_0FF1F252C39B7640">
important, and cannot be neglected without great di&s;|honour to him, and awful danger to your&s;elves.</P>
<P>Let me exhort parents to bring their children to bapti&s;m. Though of late there has been a great increa&s;e of bapti&s;ms, &s;till there are among us &s;ome hou&s;eholds unbaptized.</P>
<P>I &s;peak now only to tho&s;e, who acknowledge the right of infants to bapti&s;m; for this is not a time to bring forward matters of controver&s;y. If you believe that bapti&s;m is an in&s;titution of God; and that, under the Go&s;pel, as under former di&s;pen&s;ations of the cove|nant of grace, children are to be dedicated to him&mdash;if you recollect, that under the patriarchal, as well as Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation, the &s;eal of God's covenant was to be applied to them&mdash;if you call to mind, that, in the fir&s;t creation of man, God ordained that children &s;hould be a &s;eed to him&s;elf, and made this ordinance a part of his covenant with Adam, as the prophet Malachi ob|&s;erves; you will feel your&s;elves bound to pre&s;ent your children to God, and to procure for them the appoint|ed token of their covenant relation to him.</P>
<P>The pro&s;perity of the church greatly depends on the religious education of children, and the attendant ble&s;|&s;ing of God. And your con&s;ecration of them to him, in his in&s;tituted way, will be a mean of awakening your attention to their education, and of obtaining his ble&s;&s;ing for them.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="032362_0013_0FF1F25489A19B50">It is with plea&s;ure, that I have beheld, in months pa&s;t, the great increa&s;e of communicants at the Lord's table. But &s;till there are many who turn away from it. Of the youths few take a &s;eat there. I hope there are, among you, my children, tho&s;e who really reve|rence the ordinance of Chri&s;t's &s;upper. The numbers, which I often &s;ee &s;itting around, as &s;erious &s;pectators of the &s;olemnity, afford a plea&s;ing expectation, that more will draw near, and Chri&s;t's table will be full. If you are detained from this ordinance by religious fears, your very fears prove your right to it. For a fear of offending God by an unworthy attendance, will not &s;top here. It will re&s;train you from offending him by other unworthy conduct. And a fear thus operating indicates a heart prepared to draw near to God.</P>
<P>But if you look on the ordinance with indifference; con&s;ider; it is an in&s;titution of Chri&s;t de&s;igned for the commemoration of his death; and therefore indiffer|ence to it mu&s;t involve great ingratitude, impiety and guilt.</P>
<P>We wi&s;h to &s;ee Chri&s;t's church increa&s;ing, and the young &s;ub&s;cribing with their hands to him. But we wi&s;h, that all who name the name of Chri&s;t may depart from iniquity, and walk worthy of him, who has called them to his kingdom and glory.</P>
<P>Suffer me al&s;o, my brethren, to call your attention to the &s;tated wor&s;hip of the Lord's day.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="032362_0014_0FF1F2564E9DC2A0">That &s;ocial wor&s;hip is a divine appointment, adapted to the benefit of civil &s;ociety, as well as to the promo|tion of vital godline&s;s, you will not deny. And yet it cannot be di&s;&s;embled, that, in the pre&s;ent day, multi|tudes treat it with great indifference. Let not this in|difference be &s;een among you. If you, who are profe&s;|&s;ors of religion, and heads of families, neglect, and al|low your children to neglect the wor&s;hip of the &s;anctu|ary, it is natural to apprehend, that indifference to this divine appointment will more and more prevail; and, perhaps, when a vacancy &s;hall take place among you&mdash;this event is not remote&mdash;you will have grown &s;o regardle&s;s of God's wor&s;hip, that his hou&s;e will be left you de&s;olate. It would be painful to realize, that the next generation will come forward and grow up with|out bapti&s;m&mdash;without public in&s;truction&mdash;without re|gard for the &s;abbath, or for the bible.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider the matter as it immediately re&s;pects your|&s;elves. Is an aver&s;ion to God's wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;tent with the temper which belongs to heaven? Would not an at|tendance upon it a&s;&s;i&s;t you in your per&s;onal religion, and in the education of your children? Would not your good example be highly beneficial to tho&s;e who are coming after you? Say one to another, 'Come and let us go up to the hou&s;e of the Lord.' Let your feet &s;tand within its walls. Let it appear as a city that is compact together, whither the tribes go up to give thanks to the name of the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="032362_0015_0FF1F2582DBD6190">There is another thing which I beg leave ju&s;t to men|tion. It is what mu&s;t &s;oon call your attention, unle&s;s&mdash;which heaven prevent&mdash;you cea&s;e to be a religious &s;o|ciety. I &s;hall not dwell on the &s;ubject; but I often think of it with concern. It is providing a decent and convenient hou&s;e for divine wor&s;hip. Whenever there &s;hall be a vacancy here, to &s;upply it will be exceedingly difficult&mdash;perhaps impracticable, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of your hou&s;e of wor&s;hip. The building of a meeting-hou&s;e, and the &s;ettling of a mini&s;ter at the &s;ame time, may be attended with &s;uch embarra&s;ments, as will much endanger your peace and tranquility. Your own prudence will lead you to deliberate, whether the con|currence of two &s;o important tran&s;actions, ought not, if po&s;&s;ible, to be prevented.</P>
<P N="5">5. Your &s;tanding fa&s;t in the Lord will much depend on the maintenance of <HI>family religion.</HI> If this is gene|rally neglected, all religion will &s;oon di&s;appear. Jo&s;hua thought &s;o, when he &s;aid to the people of I&s;rael, 'If it &s;eem evil to you to &s;erve the Lord, choo&s;e ye, this day, whom ye will &s;erve. But, as for me and my hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the Lord.'</P>
<P>Attend, then, to the religious education of your chil|dren, and afford them your a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the things which concern their pre&s;ent u&s;efulne&s;s and future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Train them up to indu&s;try in &s;ome hone&s;t calling. Re&s;train their irregular propen&s;ities. Encourage eve|ry virtuous di&s;po&s;ition. Furni&s;h them with the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="18" REF="032362_0016_0FF1F26360644450">
means of mental improvement. Walk before them in a perfect way. Suffer them not to become the companions of fools; but teach them to a&s;&s;ociate with the wi&s;e. Maintain &s;ocial wor&s;hip in your hou&s;es, and require their orderly attendance. This will facili|tate your dome&s;tic government, and obtain the divine ble&s;&s;ing on your hou&s;eholds.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Apo&s;tle having expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ire, that the The&s;&s;alonian believers &s;hould &s;tand fa&s;t in the Lord, adds this reque&s;t, 'The Lord make you to increa&s;e and abound in <HI>love one toward another, and toward all men,</HI> to the end he may <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h</HI> your hearts unblameable in holine&s;s.'</P>
<P>That you may &s;tand fa&s;t in Chri&s;t, you mu&s;t culti|vate a &s;pirit of candour and charity, in oppo&s;ition to bigotry&mdash;a &s;pirit of peace and humility in oppo&s;ition to &s;piritual pride, from whence comes contention.</P>

<P>Hitherto, my brethren, you have maintained a com|mendable union. I do not find, that any controver&s;y
<PB N="19" REF="032362_0017_0FF1F2651F531AA0">
has ever exi&s;ted in this church, which has required the interpo&s;ition of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council. 'Let brother|ly love continue.' Dangers have attended you; but, by the good hand of providence, you have been &s;afely conducted through them. Dangers again may ari&s;e; but be at peace among your&s;elves, and the God of peace will be with you. 'Mark them, who cau&s;e divi&s;ions and offen&s;es, contrary to the doctrine which ye have re|ceived, and avoid them; for they who are &s;uch &s;erve not the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but their own belly, and with good words and fair &s;peeches deceive the hearts of the &s;imple.'</P>
<P>There is an hypocri&s;y, which, to &s;erve a party de&s;ign, affects a zeal for the purity of the church. This, as long as it can work &s;ecretly, under the di&s;gui&s;e of piety, will produce great mi&s;chief. Excepting this, there is nothing more dangerous to the peace of the church, than religious bigotry; by which I mean, laying &s;uch unrea&s;onable weight on certain opinions and forms, as to exclude from our charity and fellow&s;hip all who di&s;|&s;ent from us.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;ects, which &s;et up &s;eparate communions, to the exclu&s;ion of other Chri&s;tians, and are indu&s;trious to make pro&s;elytes from other churches, that they may in|crea&s;e a party of their own, are building on a founda|tion very different from that which Chri&s;t has marked out. Never patronize and encourage any &s;ect founded on &s;o narrow a ba&s;is&mdash;any &s;ect which rears up it&s;elf by
<PB N="20" REF="032362_0018_0FF1F266F58775F0">
materials &s;urreptitiou&s;ly collected from other buildings.</P>
<P>To undermine one chri&s;tian &s;ociety in order to build up another, is the e&s;&s;ence of bigotry, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from charity. On this principle few chri&s;tian churches can exi&s;t; for you will find, in the &s;ame vicinity, few Chri&s;tians who do not, in &s;ome things, differ from one another. And if every di&s;agreement mu&s;t cau&s;e a &s;e|paration, &s;carcely two can walk together. And we find in fact, that &s;ocieties, erected on this narrow ba&s;is, &s;oon totter and fall into ruins.</P>
<P>In this imperfect &s;tate there mu&s;t be charity and con|de&s;cention, el&s;e there can be no union and &s;tability in chri&s;tian churches.</P>
<P>I remind you of the&s;e things, though ye know them, and are e&s;tabli&s;hed in the pre&s;ent truths. I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to &s;tir you up by putting you in remembrance, knowing, that &s;hortly I mu&s;t put off this tabernacle. And I de&s;ire, that, af|ter my decea&s;e, ye may be able to have the&s;e things al|ways in remembrance.</P>
<P>The time here allotted us is &s;hort. Soon our days on earth will be numbered: Let us fill them up with u&s;efulne&s;s, that we may fini&s;h them with joy.</P>
<P>When I look back, I am &s;urprized to &s;ee how &s;oon forty years have pa&s;&s;ed away. The time which re|mains to me, and to &s;ome of you, will &s;carcely be per|ceived. Let us, who are walking together in the
<PB N="21" REF="032362_0019_0FF1F268CA7B6150">
downward path of life, contemplate our end, and apply our hearts to wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>There are many pre&s;ent in this a&s;&s;embly, who have no recollection of the commencement of my mini&s;try. Their exi&s;tence began at a later date. But you, my friends, will &s;oon find your&s;elves in the li&s;t of the aged. You already begin to take a &s;hare in the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o|ciety. You, perhaps, will have a part to act in the &s;et|tlement of another mini&s;ter. May your hearts be fil|led with tho&s;e pious &s;entiments, and &s;ocial affections, which will qualify you for the part a&s;&s;igned you in this world, and for the happine&s;s propo&s;ed to you in the next.</P>
<P>May this chri&s;tian &s;ociety, which has &s;tood for an hundred years, &s;till &s;tand fa&s;t in the Lord. The pious zeal of your fathers laid a foundation for the privileges, which you here enjoy: See that you, with equal zeal, tran&s;mit them to &s;ucceeding generations. May they, who &s;hall live an hundred years hence, recognize your works of piety, as you do theirs, who lived an hundred years ago.</P>
<P>To awaken in us the zeal recommended, and to en|force the advice offered to us, we will take a view of the origin and progre&s;s of this &s;ociety, and of the deal|ings of providence toward it.</P>
<P>The town of <HI>Springfield,</HI> (of which this town re|mained a part until 1774) was &s;ettled from Roxbury
<PB N="22" REF="032362_0020_0FF1F2743837B940">
in the year 1636, ju&s;t 16 years after the arrival of our fathers at Plymouth. In the preceeding year, planta|tions were begun in Wind&s;or, Hart&s;ord and Wethers|field, by adventurers from Dorche&s;ter, Newtown, (now called Cambridge) and Watertown. Gov. Winthrop, in his Journal, &s;ays, "In October 1635, about 60 men women and children, went by land towards Connecti|cut, with their cows, heifers and &s;wine, and after a te|dious and difficult journey, arrived &s;afe there.&mdash;But the people from Dorche&s;ter who removed their cattle be|fore winter, lo&s;t the greate&s;t part of them. Some, however, which came late, and could not be put over the river, lived well thro' the winter without any hay. The people were put to great &s;traits for want of provi|&s;ions. They ate malt, grains, and acorns; and they lo&s;t near &pound;2000 worth of cattle."</P>
<P>At this time cattle of all kinds were extremely dear. "A good cow was valued at &pound;25 or &pound;30; a pair of oxen at &pound;40; &s;heep at 50<HI>&s;</HI> a head."</P>
<P>The rea&s;on alledged for the&s;e emigrations was, that "all the towns within the Bay began to be much &s;traitened by their nearne&s;s to one another, and by the great increa&s;e of their cattle."</P>
<P>But though the want of room might be the fir&s;t mo|tive, a &s;pirit of enterprize &s;trongly co-operated with it: For the emigrations were &s;o large, that the old towns were thereby exceedingly weakened and dimini&s;hed.
<PB N="23" REF="032362_0021_0FF1F277B98D0C28">
Governor Winthrop &s;ays, "In 1636, Mr. Hooker, pa&s;tor of the church of Newtown and the be&s;t of his congregation went to Connecticut and drove thither 160 heads of cattle." And from Dorche&s;ter Mr. Warham the pa&s;tor removed with almo&s;t his whole church, &s;o that &s;oon after we find the people in that town delibe|rating on the formation of a <HI>new</HI> church, "a great part of the old one being gone to Connecticut."</P>
<P>The fir&s;t planters in Springfield were no more than eight <HI>men.</HI> The number of women and children I have not been able to learn. Their fir&s;t intention was to have &s;ettled on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river, as did the adventurers in the towns below. Accordingly they be|gan to build in the great meadow, at a place from that circum&s;tance denominated, and &s;till called <HI>Hou&s;e Mea|dow;</HI> but on the friendly advice of the natives, that the place was &s;ubject to inundations, they changed their purpo&s;e, and removed to the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>Though they were few in number, yet, animated with a &s;pirit of piety, they early provided for the &s;et|tlement of the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try. And within one year after the plantation began, Mr. Moxon, their fir&s;t mini&s;|ter, was with them.</P>
<P>The people on Connecticut river generally lived in peace with their Indian neighbours. The town of Wethersfield, however, in the &s;econd year after the &s;et|tlement began, met with a &s;evere blow. "Sequin, a
<PB N="24" REF="032362_0022_0FF1F2799C239530">
head man of the river Indians, gave lands on the ri|ver to the Engli&s;h, that he might &s;it down by them and be protected. But when he came to Wethersfield and &s;et up his wigwam, the people drove him away by force. Re&s;enting the wrong, but wanting &s;trength to revenge it, he &s;ecretly drew in the Pequots, who came up the river, and killed &s;ix men at their work, and three wo|men, and captivated two girls, and de&s;troyed a hor&s;e and twenty cows." As this mi&s;chief was in con&s;equence of a provocation offered on the part of the Engli&s;h, they, by advice from the governor and magi&s;trates in Bo&s;ton, in&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting a war, made a new agreement with the Indians of the river.</P>
<P>The people in Springfield &s;uffered no mole&s;tation from <HI>their</HI> Indians, until the year 1675, which was a time of great calamity.</P>
<P>The famous warrior king Philip, who had ever been an enemy to the Engli&s;h, being driven from his head quarters at Bri&s;tol, then called <HI>mount Hope,</HI> came with his Indians to the we&s;tward; and, having de&s;troyed Brookfield, advanced to the river, and excited among the Indians here a general di&s;affection to the Engli&s;h. The people in this and the northern towns on the ri|ver, began to apprehend danger, and to put them&s;elves in a &s;tate of defence. The people in Springfield, how|ever, relying on the prefe&s;&s;ions of the Indians, felt too &s;ecure. Ho&s;tilities committed in the towns above, in Augu&s;t and September, increa&s;ed their concern; but
<PB N="25" REF="032362_0023_0FF1F27B607C3920">
&s;till they did not realize their danger, until, by a me&s;|&s;age from Wind&s;or, they were informed, that 300 of Philip's men had joined with the Springfield Indians, and were then in the Indian fort on Long Hill, and that their intention was to de&s;troy the town. This plot was di&s;clo&s;ed by one of the Wind&s;or Indians. On this alar|ming intelligence, the people fled to their fortified hou|&s;es, and thus &s;aved them&s;elves from a general ma&s;&s;acre.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 5th of October, O. S. two men, with an intention to examine the truth of the informati|on from Wind&s;or, &s;et out for the Indian fort; but were fired upon by the way; one was killed, the other mor|tally wounded. The conflagration of the town imme|diately en&s;ued, in which were con&s;umed about 30 hou|&s;es, and 20 barns. Only two or three hou&s;es e&s;caped: The&s;e were fortified. A&s;&s;i&s;tance was &s;ent from other towns, but arrived too late. Be&s;ides the two men above mentioned, there were &s;everal wounded, and one mor|tally. One woman was &s;lain.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Breck's Century Sermon.</NOTE></P>
<P>One of the men killed in the morning in the way to|ward the fort, was Mr. Thomas Miller, from whom de|&s;cended the family of that name in this pari&s;h.</P>
<P>At this time there were &s;ome hou&s;es in Longmeadow, and a number on this &s;ide of the river, none of which were de&s;troyed. The enemies fir&s;t object was the de|&s;truction
<PB N="26" REF="032362_0024_0FF1F287639E5110">
of the principal &s;ettlement. Before they could extend their operations, &s;uccours arrived.</P>
<P>But in the &s;pring following, &s;ome mi&s;chief was done on this &s;ide of the river. In Chicopee-&s;treet, &s;o called, about a mile north of the meeting-hou&s;e, the Indians killed a young man named Pelatiah Morgan; and at the &s;ame time, captivated a lad, who was in company with him. The lad afterward returned.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year, by the be&s;t information I can ob|tain, Mr. Abel Leonard, who lived near the &s;outh bank of Agawam, was &s;hot in his canoe, as he was pa&s;&s;ing that river. One of his de&s;cendants, of the fifth genera|tion, now dwells on the &s;ame lot.</P>
<P>There is an imperfect tradition of others, captivated, and &s;lain, of whom I can collect no &s;atisfactory account.</P>
<P>Within the memory of our aged people, &s;ome of the hou&s;es here were fortified and garri&s;oned; and within about 50 years pa&s;t, watches were occa&s;ionally appointed to patrole our &s;treets, for fear of the enemy.</P>
<P>Happy are we, who &s;leep in our hou&s;es, and go forth to our labours in &s;afety, &amp; have none to make us afraid.</P>
<P>At what time the &s;ettlements on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river began, I cannot learn with exactne&s;s; but it was probably as early as the year 1660. In the &s;pace of 39 years, the hou&s;es in that part of the town, which is now the fir&s;t pari&s;h in Springfield, had increa&s;ed from per|haps about 8 to but little more than 30: and yet in
<PB N="27" REF="032362_0025_0FF1F2891D685200">
1664, which was 11 years before, there were, in the whole town, 73 <HI>male inhabitants.</HI> There mu&s;t there|fore have been a con&s;iderable number at that time in o|ther parts of the town.</P>
<P>In 1662, there was granted to John Riley, a <HI>hou&s;e lot,</HI> on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river, conditioned, that he &s;oon erected a hou&s;e upon it. And two years after, there was granted to Thomas Cooper, on the &s;outh &s;ide of Agawam, a <HI>hou&s;e lot,</HI> located with relation to a cel|lar, which he had already dug.</P>
<P>Within a few years after this, I find grants of <HI>hou&s;e lots</HI> in divers places; &s;ome as far we&s;t as Paucatuck-brook.</P>
<P>In 1683 there appears to have been a number of in|habitants here; for, in this year, on the 18th of March, a boat containing &s;undry per&s;ons, who, on the Lord's day, were returning from public wor&s;hip, was over&s;et in the great river, and three per&s;ons were drowned; viz. Reice and John Bedurtha, and Lydia the wife of Jo&s;eph Bedurtha. Another woman, by the name of Rogers, &s;uppo&s;ed at fir&s;t to have been dead, was re&s;tored.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fir&s;t names of Planters, on this &s;ide of the river, which I have been able to find, are Riley and Cooper.

The&s;e names, mo&s;t or all, were here before the pari&s;h was incorporated. Some of them are now extinct&mdash;&s;ome are numerous and re&s;pectable.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the year 1696, which was 60 years after the &s;ettle|ment of the town began, the inhabitants on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river, making about 30 families, were incorpora|ted
<PB N="28" REF="032362_0026_0FF1F28ADB46A698">
into a di&s;tinct pari&s;h. In June 1698 a church was gathered, and the rev'd John Woodbridge was ordained its pa&s;tor. He died in June 1618. He was well remem|bered by many people, who were living when I came to this place.

<P>In June, 1720, the rev'd. Samuel Hopkins was or|dained the &s;econd pa&s;tor of this church. He died in October, 1755, in the 62d year of his age, and 36th of his Mini&s;try.

<P>Within this pari&s;h, which then included the whole tract, now called We&s;t-Springfield, there were baptized, during his mini&s;try, 660 per&s;ons, and 210 admitted to the Lord's table.

<P>In reviewing our narrative, one thought will natu|rally &s;trike your minds; and let it be deeply impre&s;&s;ed; that your fathers, from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the&s;e towns, and even of the country, were &s;tedfa&s;t in the re|ligion of Chri&s;t&mdash;that in their deepe&s;t poverty they were zealous to maintain the in&s;tituted wor&s;hip of God
<PB N="30" REF="032362_0028_0FF1F295C83D44A8">
&mdash;and that the care and ble&s;&s;ing of providence did re|markably attend them. 'Therefore, my brethren, dear|ly beloved, &s;o &s;tand fa&s;t in the Lord.'</P>
<P>After the decea&s;e of Mr. Hopkins, the pari&s;h was va|cant about 10 months. In March, 1756, I began to preach with you; In July following was invited, and on the 25th of Augu&s;t was &s;eparated to the work of the mini&s;try in this place.</P>
<P>All the mini&s;ters, who took a part in the &s;olemnity of my ordination, are among the dead: and only two<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. Me&s;s. Mackin&s;try, and Hopkins of Hadley.</NOTE> &s;urvive of tho&s;e who con&s;tituted the ordaining council, which was uncommonly numerous.</P>
<P>In 1757, the &s;outhern part of the original pari&s;h was erected into a di&s;tinct pari&s;h, containing about 75 fami|lies. In September, 1762, a church was formed, con|&s;i&s;ting of Chri&s;tians of different denominations, who, with great appearance of candour, waved their di&s;tin|gui&s;hing &s;entiments, and covenanted to attend on the &s;ame mini&s;try, and commune at the &s;ame table. On the week following, the rev'd. Sylvanus Gri&s;wold was ordained their pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>A little before the death of Mr. Hopkins, a number of inhabitants in the north part of the original pari&s;h, uniting with a number on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the great ri|ver,
<PB N="31" REF="032362_0029_0FF1F29BB8181798">
were incorporated into one pari&s;h; and, in 1752, called and &s;ettled the rev'd. John Mackin&s;try.</P>
<P>That part which lies on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river, by a late act of divi&s;ion, is become a di&s;tinct &s;ociety, and is the third pari&s;h in this town. It has a meeting-hou&s;e; but is de&s;titute of a mini&s;ter. We hope it will not long remain &s;o.</P>
<P>When the &s;econd, or &s;outh pari&s;h was incorporated, there remained in this about 95 families, and 550 &s;ouls. Ten years ago the number of families was 154, and of &s;ouls 897. Within the &s;ame limits, the families are now 171, and the &s;ouls about 990. Nine families have lately been annexed to this from the &s;outh pari&s;h. The pre&s;ent number of families is 180, and of &s;ouls about 1050. The average increa&s;e of the pari&s;h for 40 years has been 2 families a year. The progre&s;s in the la&s;t 10 years has been nearly the &s;ame, as in preceding years. In this period the emigrations have much exceeded the immigrations.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t 20 years of my mini&s;try, the number of deaths was 208; the mean number of &s;ouls, I &s;uppo&s;e, was about 670; the proportion, &s;omething le&s;s than 1 to 3. In the &s;pace of 30 years, the number of deaths was 346; the mean number of &s;ouls about 724; the proportion a little &s;hort of 1 to 2. In the whole peri|od

The increa&s;e, &s;ince the June of the la&s;t year, has been di&s;tingui&s;hed. The Lord make you to increa&s;e more and more in numbers and in good works.</P>
<P>May the remaining part of my mini&s;try be rendered more u&s;eful, than the pa&s;t; and through your prayers may I obtain grace to fulfil the mini&s;try, which I have received of the Lord Je&s;us to te&s;tify the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and thus fini&s;h my cour&s;e with joy.</P>
<P>Our relation has hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in comfortable peace and friend&s;hip. May it &s;o continue to the end.</P>
<P>I remember, with gratitude, many kindne&s;&s;es which I have received; and you have my ardent wi&s;hes and daily prayers for your tranquility and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Among the te&s;timonies of your regard and benevo|lence, there is a recent one for which you will accept my particular thanks. The benefaction to which I al|lude was &s;o liberal and &s;ea&s;onable, and &s;o happily adap|ted to my exigences, that it could not but be gratefully felt. It was made with a cheerfulne&s;s and ardour, which add much to its intrin&s;ic worth; and with &s;o great unanimity, that I confe&s;s my &s;elf indebted to you all.</P>
<P>May your benevolence awaken in me a greater dili|gence

in your &s;ervice. May your union among your|&s;elves be pre&s;erved. May peace and wi&s;dom guide all your &s;teps. May you never want a mini&s;ter who will heartily feel, ardently pray, and cheerfully labour for you in the Lord. May the word and &s;pirit of God ne|ver be removed from you, nor from your &s;eed nor from your &s;eed's &s;eed, ever down to the late&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of our mortal race.</P>
<P>And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among them who are &s;anctified. And I intreat you for the Lord Je&s;us &s;ake, and for the love of the &s;pirit, that you &s;trive together in your prayers and labours for the common intere&s;t of Chri&s;t's church, and for the particular intere&s;t of this &s;ociety. May my remaining &s;ervices be accepted of the &s;aints, and u&s;eful to you all. May I come to you with joy, and with you be refre&s;hed.</P>
<P>May the God of peace be with you all.</P>
