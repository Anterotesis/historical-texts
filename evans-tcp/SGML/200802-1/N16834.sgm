<P>THE occa&s;ion of the pre&s;ent &s;olemnity is evidently decent and pious. We cannot behold the&s;e military gentlemen, incorporated for pur|po&s;es valuable to &s;ociety, waiting upon God with humble &s;upplication and thank&s;giving on this day of their Annual Election, without &s;en&s;ations of approbation, e&s;teem, and plea&s;ure.&mdash;It is owing to the ble&s;&s;ing of the great and beneficent Being whom they are a&s;&s;embled to wor&s;hip, that, they have been &s;ed, cloathed, and refre&s;hed during the pa&s;t year, and appear before him this day with the gaiety, elegance, and activity of the &s;oldier.

<P>NOR does this &s;olemnity only gain our approba|tion as a religious &s;ervice, but as a re&s;pectful memorial of the good &s;en&s;e, and piety of our Fore|fathers.

our hands! This appeal immediately intere&s;ts the feelings, and commands the opinion of many, whom we cannot but love for their meek and gentle di&s;po&s;ition, again&s;t war in every form, and under every condition.&mdash;However &s;peciou&s;ly de|fended, it is, &s;ay they, abhorrent to God, to the be&s;t feelings of human nature, and the amiable and charitable &s;pirit of the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>PEACE is a lovely object of contemplation to the human mind and imagination, and her influences are mo&s;t plea&s;ant to our feelings. Under her be|nignant reign &s;ecurity &s;miles in the countenances, and rejoices the hearts of mankind: The State&s;man quietly inve&s;tigates the publick intere&s;t, and gra|dually introduces wi&s;e and beneficial regulations: Agriculture flouri&s;hes: Commerce pro&s;pers: The Arts and Sciences improve: And, every cau&s;e al|mo&s;t con&s;pires to propagate and e&s;tabli&s;h the prin|ciples and habits of publick and private order, virtue and happine&s;s.&mdash;Nor can it be di&s;&s;embled that WAR is an evil mo&s;t ju&s;tly dreaded by the thoughtful, ju&s;t and humane in every &s;ociety:&mdash;In its milde&s;t form it greatly le&s;&s;ens enjoyment wherever it prevails, and &s;ubjects mankind to di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing fears and &s;ufferings: And, in its har&s;he&s;t, like the &s;torm of Heaven, &s;preads darkne&s;s over the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and cheerful pro&s;pects, and marks its progre&s;s with ravage, de&s;truction, and mi&s;ery. Humanity weeps, and refu&s;es to be comforted, when &s;he beholds this &s;courge of the world reign|ing

<P>BEFORE I proceed to enlarge upon the&s;e ob&s;er|vations, I would mention that the following truths are taken for granted&mdash;that we are under the cog|nizance and government of an almighty and per|fect Being, who has made known his will to us, not only by rea&s;on and experience, but by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and expects we &s;hould venerate and obey it; and that man is a rational and accountable creature, in &s;ome proper &s;en&s;e ma&s;ter of his own actions, and amenable for his conduct at his bar.&mdash;If we are not under the government of God, and are not accountable, then all actions and cour&s;es of action become indifferent, and it is mere idlene&s;s to &s;pend any time in &s;peculation upon their nature and con&s;equences. But allowing the&s;e maxims to be ju&s;t, &s;uch inve&s;tigations we mu&s;t conceive immediately proper, for they may be of infinite con&s;equence to our ca&s;e of mind, and our improve|ment and worth.</P>

1. THE ULTIMATE SOURCE of War is tho&s;e prin|ciples and pa&s;&s;ions which experience, ob&s;ervation, and univer&s;al hi&s;tory prove actuate mankind when formed into different &s;ocieties, and oppo&s;ed to each other by rival&s;hip, and injuries, ari&s;ing from mutual endeavours for &s;uperiority and lucrative advan|tages&mdash;Tho&s;e principles and pa&s;&s;ions which go|vern them when fellow-&s;ubjects of the &s;ame civil community, after they are divided into parties, ir|ritated by neglects and wrongs, or &s;educed by the &s;lattering promi&s;es of ambition and power to at|tempt preeminence. But the PROXIMATE SOURCE of War is that &s;eparation of nations and individu|als which oppo&s;es them, and in&s;pires them with ho&s;tile intentions.&mdash;Until a divi&s;ion takes place between them, leading them to &s;uch mea&s;ures as are affrontive, and will in the general opinion, ei|ther well grounded, or artificially rai&s;ed, be ruin|ous to their honour and intere&s;ts, tho&s;e fierce prin|ciples in human nature which rou&s;e to re&s;i&s;tance and injury lie inactive, as the various &s;prings and wheels of a machine, until &s;et in motion by the power which is to govern them. Were mankind individually enlightened, or under the government of enlightened leaders&mdash;were they humble, mild, equitable and benevolent, or under the &s;upreme direction of rulers governed by a ju&s;t and benefi|cent temper, War would be no more. The diffe|rent &s;ocieties on earth would form into one grand

and peaceful monarchy; or if they continued &s;e|parate would live together like independent fami|lies loving, and beloved&mdash;Subjects of the &s;ame &s;o|ciety, like affectionate children of the &s;ame family, would &s;weetly unite together in every office of ju&s;tice and kindne&s;s.&mdash;But this is not the pre&s;ent condition of mankind; nor has it ever been their condition, if we may believe the hi&s;torical regi&s;ters of the times before us. The great body of man|kind, and tho&s;e who controul and govern them, may, in the cool hours of retirement and reflection, judge the &s;ituation of univer&s;al peace and love de|lightful: But when they enter the world and begin to act, they are not influenced by &s;uch agreeable &s;entiments. Their under&s;tandings per&s;uade them very differently, when concerned with men and things, than when engaged with &s;peculative no|tions, and the plea&s;ing pictures of fancy and ima|gination. Mankind do not choo&s;e to live together under one denomination, to be governed by the &s;ame laws, and have the &s;ame intere&s;ts; but to dwell &s;eparately, govern them&s;elves by different civil con&s;titutions, and pur&s;ue different intere&s;ts, though they cannot without mutual oppo&s;ition and injury. Members of the &s;ame community will divide into inveterate parties; and will often pur|&s;ue their oppo&s;ite mea&s;ures until they dye each others garments in blood. Or, if we &s;uppo&s;e their choice is not the cau&s;e of their divi&s;ion into &s;epa|rate nations and parties, then we mu&s;t affirm it
<PB N="10" REF="021669_0010_0FB5091020993ED0">
owing to the ordination of our great Creator, who will do all his plea&s;ure throughout univer&s;al na|ture.&mdash;But whether mankind are in a &s;eparate &s;tate by their own choice, or the will of their Creator, it is their divi&s;ion which awakes and gives force to tho&s;e principles and pa&s;&s;ions which have in every age of the world, however ignorant and barbarous, civilized and well in&s;tructed, been a &s;ource of wars and fightings. The hi&s;tory of the people men|tioned in our text, will exemplify the operation of human pa&s;&s;ions between different nations, nearly enough &s;ituated to be politically connected; and the &s;ame nation divided into two powerful parties. For, notwith&s;tanding EPHRAIM and JUDAH were now different nations, yet they had the feelings of parties in the &s;ame nation.&mdash;They originally de|&s;cended from the &s;ame &s;tock, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a common territory, and were fellow &s;ubjects of the &s;ame do|minion, though they had &s;eparated upon political di&s;&s;en&s;ions; and &s;uppo&s;ed very naturally they had an equal claim to &s;uperiority on the inheritance God had given them, if they could acquire it by art or force.&mdash;JUDAH enjoyed the mo&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hed advantages in con&s;equence of their &s;epa|ration:&mdash;They were more numerous, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the large&s;t, the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and fruitful part of the land&mdash;Moreover, they had among&s;t them the only authorized wor&s;hip of God, which was e&s;teemed an invaluable ble&s;&s;ing.&mdash;What was the effect upon EPHRAIM of their more de&s;irable con|dition?&mdash;
<PB N="11" REF="021669_0011_0FB50911954C87A8">
They beheld their more re&s;pectable and happy neighbours with a degree of envy which &s;oured their minds, irritated their pa&s;&s;ions, and di&s;|po&s;ed them to improve every means which pro|mi&s;ed to aba&s;e them. What was the effect of their re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition and injurious conduct upon JUDAH?&mdash;They looked down upon their feeble and impatient enemy with haughty and re&s;entful airs, and exerted their policy and power to vex and de&s;troy them. In this general &s;tate of &s;entiment and feeling, the great body of their people were ea&s;ily inflamed with the rage of war, whenever their influential men were led by their ambi|tion, their private intere&s;ts and private enmities, their love of power and &s;ame, or indeed the pa&s;|&s;ions and humours of their near connections to wi&s;h they &s;hould be: And, events were often tak|ing place in con&s;equence of their general &s;ituation, and frequent commerce with each other, which gave them room under the cover of patriotick de|clarations to excite a &s;pirit of animo&s;ity &s;atiated only with injury and blood&s;hed. Hence their fre|quent inroads, and endeavours to perplex, di&s;tre&s;s, and humble each other.</P>
<P>BUT ye will a&s;k, how can this con&s;titution of things be reconciled to the &s;upreme government of perfect rectitude, wi&s;dom, and benevolence? How can &s;o powerful, righteous, and good a Being decree or permit human &s;ituations and pa&s;&s;ions to

And when be hideth his face, who then can behold him, whether it be done again&s;t a nation or again&s;t a man only?</HI> And, why mu&s;t we &s;uppo&s;e this con&s;titution militates with the excellence of his nature? The mo&s;t for|midable rea&s;on we can urge again&s;t its introduction is, That it places man lower upon the &s;cale of vir|tue and enjoyment than he otherwi&s;e would be. This is allowed:&mdash;Were mankind governed by the principles of union, and did the motives of piety, ju&s;tice, and benevolence reign in them with an influence de&s;tructive to every kind of injury and war, they would be much more amiable, lovely, and virtuous than they now are; they would be free from many inconveniences and mi|&s;eries which they now feel, and enjoy a degree of happine&s;s which they now feebly imagine. But this is not their condition. They have &s;o large a &s;hare of the brutal united with the divine in their nature, as to continue them hitherto in a far le&s;s re&s;pectable and happy &s;tate of being. Still, this is only &s;aying, man is le&s;s perfect, and le&s;s happy than God might have made him.&mdash;But, "<HI>Shall the thing formed &s;ay to him that formed it, Why ha&s;t thou made me thus?</HI>" What arrogance and impi|ety?&mdash;

May not he who freely gives unto his crea|tures capacities of worth and means of enjoyment, give them in the proportion he plea&s;es, provided exi&s;tence is on the whole a ble&s;&s;ing; not a cur&s;e, but in con&s;equence of our voluntary ill-behaviour?&mdash;Mu&s;t he give in the highe&s;t degree he is able, or be chargeable with want of wi&s;dom, with inju&s;tice and cruelty?&mdash;Con&s;ider whither this rea&s;oning leads you&mdash;If the Deity had acted in the &s;pirit of this principle, that immen&s;e variety of creatures he has made, filling up in nice gradation the &s;pace between the humble&s;t in&s;ect, and the mo&s;t exalted &s;pirit, and di&s;playing every po&s;&s;ible degree of ac|tivity, intelligence, virtue and happine&s;s would have failed.

judgment with which a ju&s;t God afflicts his crea|tures.&mdash;But let us remember, in this very painful &s;ituation, that God in the mid&s;t of judgments for|gets not mercy, and often from exce&s;&s;ive evils pro|duces very valuable ble&s;&s;ings.&mdash;The violence and mi&s;ery we &s;o &s;en&s;ibly feel and pity, <HI>may</HI> be pro|ductive of very important and happy events:&mdash;They may &s;ecure freedom to a people, depre&s;&s;ed and mi&s;erable, yield them immediately the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ations of &s;ati&s;faction and plea&s;ure, and lay a foundation for their publick worth and felicity which &s;hall la&s;t for ages.&mdash;They may act like very powerful and painful medicine in the human body&mdash;produce intire and beneficial charges&mdash;rou&s;e &s;ocieties thoughtle&s;s, enervated, and abandoned to con&s;ideration, and influence them to a change of manners which &s;hall render them re&s;pectable and pro&s;perous.&mdash;They &s;ome|times place &s;ocieties incurably vicious, before mankind, affecting examples of the &s;ad con&s;e|quence of impious and un&s;ocial manners under the government of God; and very per&s;ua&s;ively urge tho&s;e which behold them to &s;hun their profli|gacy, that they may avoid their ruin.

plundered city is a &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h, but the conquering army is the &s;eat of congratula|tion and cheerful fe&s;tivity. The lo&s;&s;es of friends and hard-earned property of which the vanqui&s;h|ed complain with &s;uch woeful countenances and animated expre&s;&s;ions of grief; the victorious count their gain, and celebrate as very &s;ignal favours.&mdash;The extreme poverty which overtakes &s;ome from want of employment, is balanced by the new de|partments of bu&s;ine&s;s which war opens, and the di&s;tinction and plenty with which they ble&s;s tho&s;e who pro&s;ecute them.&mdash;It is evident then of war, as it is of many other cau&s;es of human &s;uffering, that it is not a clear and unmixed evil; but by the indulgence of God made productive of kind effects to balance in a degree the pain which, in many in&s;tances, it occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>TAKE the whole variety of human &s;ituations, and we &s;hall find no one &s;tate &s;o indulgent to vice, as to exclude intirely re&s;pectable characters, u&s;eful and divine virtues. War is productive of much depravity and vice.&mdash;In the &s;tate of war dome&s;tick and civil government are much relaxed; and there is &s;uch a continued &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of objects pa&s;&s;ing before us which engage our imaginations and pa&s;&s;ions, and are connected with our mo&s;t valuable intere&s;ts, as takes off our attention from tho&s;e intere&s;ting &s;ubjects of religion and morals which de&s;erve our con&s;tant reverence, and &s;hould

command our con&s;tant obedience. The u&s;ual cour&s;e of things alters; and the alteration has a pernicious influence upon many. Acqui&s;itions of property and di&s;tinction in the natural &s;tate of things are gradually made: And before we make them in any di&s;tingui&s;hing degree, we are pre|pared to receive them with equal minds, and the re&s;olution of a wife and good improvement of them. But in war pro&s;perity often comes upon us by &s;urprize, we are in&s;tantly rich and powerful men&mdash;the &s;uddenne&s;s of the elevation intoxicates us, and we act without di&s;cretion or virtue.&mdash;Ad|ver&s;ity al&s;o, in the natural cour&s;e of things, ad|vances upon us gradually, and we are prepared to receive it with firmne&s;s, before it &s;eizes us with violence. But, in war, adver&s;ity often falls upon us at an unexpected moment&mdash;di&s;tracts our minds&mdash;breaks our &s;pirits&mdash;and occa&s;ions us to bla&s;|pheme Divine Providence, and abandon our&s;elves without re&s;traint to di&s;reputable and ruinous vices.&mdash;Yet war has not univer&s;ally this ill opera|tion.&mdash;Its uncertainties and changes, its pro&s;peri|ties and adver&s;ities, tend powerfully to teach us our dependence upon God, who rules over all, and the in&s;ecure nature of human happine&s;s&mdash;firmne&s;s, equanimity, &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion, tho&s;e wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of le&s;&s;ons.
