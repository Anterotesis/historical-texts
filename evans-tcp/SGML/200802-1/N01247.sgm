<P>IT is a divine as well as wi&s;e &amp; ju&s;t Remark, made by<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;ieur Pa&s;chal.</NOTE> One of the greate&s;t <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> of <HI>Thought</HI> in the La&s;t Age, that Per&s;ons of <HI>Quality</HI> and <HI>Character</HI> ought to have two <HI>Sets</HI> of thoughts, by which to regulate their Conduct: by the <HI>One</HI> they are to view them&s;elves in their State of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing <HI>Elevation,</HI> which is not from <HI>Na|ture,</HI> but Arbitrary <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment;</HI> by the <HI>Other</HI> they are to take a pro&s;pect of them|&s;elves

in their Natural Condition of <HI>Infir|mity,</HI> and <HI>Equality</HI> with the re&s;t of Man|kind. The bright Idea of their Dignity &amp; Power mu&s;t be temper'd with the more cloudy Idea of their Frailty: A Seperation of the&s;e will lead into gro&s;s Illu&s;ions, and betray into Errors fatal to them&s;elves, and their Dependents: But an happy Union of the&s;e will afford light to direct them in the bright tracts of Sub&s;tantial Glory; and forcible arguments to engage them to &s;uch a management, as &s;hall be glorious to them&s;elves, and happy to the World. The former pro&s;pect will take them off from the fal&s;e &s;cent of honour, and in&s;pire them with inflaming Incentives to the mo&s;t noble Actions, which will adorn their <HI>Cha|racter;</HI> without the latter view they will be in the neare&s;t danger of being dazled with the Glare of Grandeur, and growing giddy by looking down from their State of Eminence upon tho&s;e beneath them: If the <HI>Great</HI> forget their <HI>Dignity</HI> they will under-act the vertues becoming their Fi|gure; if they reflect not &s;teadily on their <HI>Infirmity,</HI> they will over-act the powers of their <HI>Elevation.&mdash;Know thy &s;elf</HI> is the

The&s;e will prompt them &s;o to act the part a&s;&s;igned them on the Stage of Life, that their External Condition may be found in Conjunction with the more valuable inherent Dignity of a vertuous Mind; that when Death &s;hall &s;hut up the pre&s;ent &s;cene, a brighter &s;cene of Glory may open upon them; and they appear with Superiour Characters on the Stage of true Glory and Immortality.</P>
<P>And <HI>the&s;e thoughts</HI> are not only proper for <HI>Men of Name &amp; Power</HI> them&s;elves; but are in&s;tructive to &s;uch as are under their Government: The&s;e mu&s;t view their Su|periors in the Excellency of their Station, that they may pay them tho&s;e Regards due to the Impre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Divine Maje&s;ty,</HI> which they bear; yet they mu&s;t behold them but as <HI>Gods,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Dwelling is in fle&s;h,</HI> who&s;e breath is in their No&s;trils, and may be &s;oon Stopt; which will give check to a Spirit of flattery, regulate their Expecta|tions

main Pillars of Government &s;apt; and Rulers are faithfully admoni&s;hed of the Duties of their Po&s;t, which God &amp; Men expect of them.

<HI>Power. I have &s;aid ye are Gods; and all of you are Children of the Mo&s;t High.</HI> In which we have two things ob&s;ervable.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>In&s;titution,</HI> or <HI>Divine Ordination</HI> of <HI>Civil Government: I &s;aid ye are Gods:</HI>] <HI>I &s;aid,</HI> i. e. God, who is the FOUNTAIN of all Honour and Power; I, who am KING of KINGS, the Supream LORD &amp; MASTER of the World; who&s;e Word is a Law not to be di&s;puted: <HI>I have &s;aid,</HI> i. e. have ordained, con&s;tituted and ap|pointed by my Sovereign Authority, and in my Supream Wi&s;dom. Tho' all men have the &s;ame Original, are of the &s;ame Make, and in many Articles &s;tand upon the &s;ame level; yet I have appointed that there &s;hall be &s;ome of a Superiour Cha|racter, advanced to Place, Power, and Dig|nity above others; I have made them <HI>Gods,</HI> and by my <HI>In&s;titution</HI> they mu&s;t be treated <HI>as &s;uch.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. We have in this <HI>Conce&s;&s;ion</HI> the Glori|ous <HI>Character</HI> that God Him&s;elf has put upon <HI>Civil Rulers:</HI> and their Character carries in it the mo&s;t Sublime Ideas of State and Magnificence, Power and Dig|nity: They are Gods] Not by <HI>Nature</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="001484_0010_0FB35474AACCE4D8">
or <HI>E&s;&s;ence,</HI> but by <HI>Office;</HI> Gods by <HI>Depu|tation, Analogy</HI> and Proportion. <HI>Elohim,</HI> which is a Name, given not only to the Supream Governour of the World, <HI>GOD o|ver all Ble&s;&s;ed for Ever,</HI> but al&s;o to <HI>Angels,</HI> tho&s;e Mini&s;ters that do his Plea&s;ure, that attend the Throne of Maje&s;ty above.&mdash;<HI>And all of them Sons of the Highe&s;t:</HI>] i.e. As Children bear the <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Image</HI> of their Father; &s;o the&s;e wear the Title and <HI>Name,</HI> bear the <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>Character</HI> of the Great GOD; and &s;o are Sons of the mo&s;t High, who has put &s;omething of his Maje&s;ty up|on them, and by his Con&s;titution rai&s;ed them to a Condition of Exaltation like to the Angels of Heaven, tho&s;e <HI>Sons of God,</HI> who are the Supream Mini&s;ters of his Kingdom.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We have a <HI>Correction,</HI> or qua|lification of this Conce&s;&s;ion. <HI>But ye &s;hall die like Men.</HI>] In which we may ob&s;erve two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Correction</HI> it &s;elf. Ye mu&s;t <HI>Dy</HI> like <HI>Men.</HI>] In Power and Order they are rai&s;ed above others; they are Petty Dei|ties, but they are Mortal Ones; In a little time they will be di&s;mantled of all
<PB N="9" REF="001484_0011_0FB3547763C66AB0">
the vi&s;ible En&s;igns of di&s;tingui&s;hing Great|ne&s;s, and retire off the the Stage of this World in a &s;tate of Equality with the meane&s;t. They dy <HI>like Men,</HI> i. e. like <HI>Other men,</HI> who are not thus Exalted: They dy like <HI>Men,</HI> i. e. as Creatures who are Endowed with Immortal, rea&s;onable Souls, accountable to the GOD that made them; they Dy as <HI>Men,</HI> and not Peri&s;h like the <HI>Bea&s;ts,</HI> who&s;e <HI>&s;pirit</HI> as well as body goes <HI>downwards;</HI> but as <HI>Men,</HI> who&s;e Spirits at Death return to GOD that gave them; as Men, i. e. as Beings who&s;e Bo|dies &s;hall not always ly in the Du&s;t, but &s;hall be redeem'd from Corruption; who&s;e Fle&s;h and Spirit &s;hall be again united in order to an a&s;&s;ignment to an Eternal State, either of Bli&s;s or Mi&s;ery, by the Deter|mination of the Judge of the World. So it points us not only to their <HI>Morta|lity,</HI> but al&s;o to that <HI>Judgment</HI> that fol|lows upon Death, and the important <HI>Con|&s;equents</HI> thereof.</P>
<P N="2">2. We may ob&s;erve the de&s;ign of this <HI>Correction.</HI> Which is to <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Qua|lify</HI> the thoughts of the foregoing Con|ce&s;&s;ion. The foregoing Character given
<PB N="10" REF="001484_0012_0FB3547A7B15B798">
of Rulers, might be well &s;u&s;pected as drawn with Colours too bright, Strokes too bold, and in a Form too Divine; Now a Pro&s;pect of their Mortality and con&s;equent Darkne&s;s is repre&s;ented, as dark Shades, without which their Picture would not be full, Ju&s;t and Natural; nor they repre&s;ented in their compleat Figure, and native Complexion. This Darkne&s;s is as nece&s;&s;ary, as the former Light to take a ju&s;t View of them.</P>
<P>The very nature and de&s;ign of this Correction, do's intimate the great Ad|vantage and Propriety of having the <HI>Thoughts</HI> of the Dignity of Rulers tem|per'd and qualify'd with wi&s;e Reflecti|ons on their Mortality, and it's important Con&s;equents.</P>
<P>Now agreeably to what has been ob|&s;erved in both parts of our Text, there are four <HI>Significant Articles</HI> which demand our Con&s;ideration, and &s;hall be the <HI>Heads</HI> of my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e. As,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>I.</HI> That the <HI>Original</HI> of <HI>Government</HI> a|mong men is <HI>Divine,</HI> or from Heaven.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>IV.</HI> That it will be of Great <HI>Advan|tage</HI> to temper the thoughts of their <HI>Dig|nity,</HI> with ju&s;t Reflections on their Ex|pected <HI>Mortality</HI> and it's Con&s;equents.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Of the&s;e in their Order.</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> The <HI>Original</HI> of <HI>Government</HI> is <HI>Di|vine.</HI> It is from GOD, by his Soveraign Con&s;titution and Appointment. <HI>I &s;aid, Ye are Gods.</HI> It is not barely a <HI>Permi&s;&s;i|on</HI> of Divine Providence, but a <HI>Divine In&s;titution</HI> that there be Government in the World. It is no difficulty to di&s;tin|gui&s;h between particular <HI>Forms</HI> of Go|vernment, and Government it &s;elf; be|tween the <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> Exalted to Govern|ment, and the &s;everal Orders and De|grees of &s;uch in a State, and that Power which is devolved on them: The former are of <HI>Humane Determination,</HI> and Ap|poinment; the latter of <HI>Divine Ordina|tion.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Species</HI> and <HI>Form</HI> of Civil Go|vernment in the World is Various: There is a Democracy, Ari&s;tocracy, Monarchy,
<PB N="12" REF="001484_0014_0FB3547F2D4D8CA8">
and there is a mixture of the&s;e; where the Powers of Each are Limited, and brought to an happy Poi&s;e; where <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Privilege</HI> are &s;o twi&s;ted together, and inlay'd in the Foundation of the Con&s;titution, as not to bear a &s;eperation without a mutual De&s;truction; Power cant be Exerci&s;ed, but the Privileges of the Ruled mu&s;t be Maintained; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Privilege be Enjoyed, unle&s;s the Power of Rulers be A&s;&s;erted and Supported. Now it cannot be &s;ay'd that This or the Other particular Species of Government is In&s;tituted by GOD for this or that People. Nor is it &s;uppo&s;eable that there is, or ever was, any State or Nation, that did inviolably, without &s;ome <HI>Alteration E&s;&s;ential,</HI> maintain the &s;ame Form of Go|vernment. To be &s;ure <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> GOD's Favourite People, had not always the &s;ame Model of Government; nor did GOD, who was, in a di&s;tingui&s;hing Style <HI>their King,</HI> Ever pre&s;cribe them &s;uch a <HI>Scheme</HI> of <HI>Rule,</HI> which they might on no terms Vary from. <HI>Athens, Sparta,</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> which in their Day appeared fixed in the full Centre of Light and Glory, &s;uffer'd
<PB N="13" REF="001484_0015_0FB3548157C16BC0">
&s;everal Revolutions and Changes in the main Frame of their Admini&s;trations: Nor has the Form of Government in our Nation, been ju&s;t the &s;ame from the be|ginning; which all mu&s;t own that are not Strangers to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Story. The Determination of what Particular Form &s;hould take place in this or that Nation, has been left to the Wi&s;dom of the Na|tions; as long as the General de&s;ign of Rule is provided for, and not Subverted. That Form which is mo&s;t adapted for one People, may not be for another; Con&s;idering the various Cu&s;toms, Tem|pers, Policies, Intere&s;ts of Nations of Differing Climates.</P>
<P>But this notwith&s;tanding, that there mu&s;t be <HI>Government</HI> is not from the bare Will of men, but from the Mo&s;t High, who <HI>Ruleth</HI> in the <HI>Kingdoms of Men,</HI> and giveth it to whom &s;o ever he will: He has put his Soveraign Sanction upon it; and made it a fixed Ordinance of Heaven, that there be a Rule over Men; The <HI>God of I&s;rael</HI> has &s;ay'd it, and the <HI>Rock of I&s;rael</HI> has &s;poken it.</P>
<P>There are Various <HI>Degrees</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI>

of men Engaged in the Admini&s;trations of Rule; who have differing Styles and Powers under Various Limitations, and Each Degree have their proper Sphere to move and act in: And the wayes of Ex|alting men to the Seat of Government, whether <HI>Supream</HI> or <HI>Subordinate,</HI> have been differing: and none of the&s;e have a &s;pecial immediate <HI>Stamp of Divinity</HI> upon them. However it is the Soveraign Plea|&s;ure of Heaven that there &s;hould be Or|der, Superiority and Rule in Civil So|ciety's; and all Rulers of what Degree &s;oever are <HI>Ordain'd of God.</HI></P>
<P>This truth &s;tands in the &s;tronge&s;t Point of Light in the Word of GOD; and will be Legible after all the attempts of any to Ob&s;cure it. The unerring Oracles of Heaven has lay'd the Foundation of Civil Government firm in <HI>Divine In&s;ti|tution.</HI> What &s;hort of this can be inten|ded in many places? <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 6.

<P>And this <HI>In&s;titution</HI> of Government, is founded on Rea&s;on; and GOD has done it in Infinite Wi&s;dom, and in Kindne&s;s to men.

GOD is the Supream Governour among the Nations; It is his Prerogative to Rule in the Kingdoms of Men; and has Right, as well as Might, to give them to whom he Plea&s;es, to Set up, and Spurn down

<P N="2">2. This Title Sugge&s;ts, the great. <HI>De|&s;ign</HI> of the In&s;titution of Government a|mong men, is that Rulers may be <HI>Gods</HI> to a People, <HI>i. e.</HI> Diffu&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ings to the Publick: When the Great LORD of the World is plea&s;ed to &s;tyle him&s;elf the GOD of a Per&s;on or People, it certainly intends that He will Ble&s;s them, and Promote their Happine&s;s; Employ his Wi&s;dom, Power, Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s with his other Perfections, for their Peace and Pro&s;perity, Security, Protection and Glo|ry. In conformity to this, Rulers are <HI>Gods,</HI> when they Employ their Authority, and Influence, act the Vertues and Powers of Government they are Endow'd with, for the Good and Happine&s;s of the People under their Conduct. To be great <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> to Men is to be <HI>Gods</HI> to them. And &s;uch have mo&s;t of <HI>Divinity,</HI> true Maje&s;ty and

Power and Knowledge will not alone con&s;titute a Divine Greatne&s;s; The&s;e are found to a great degree in the mo&s;t <HI>Malig|nant Beings,</HI> who are nothing but Oppo&s;i|tion to the Nature, and Government of GOD.

Now Great|ne&s;s appears with Advantage; &s;uch are like the Great Light of Heaven which di&s;pen|&s;es its Influences far and wide; they are as a Publick Fountain, who&s;e waters flow down to all; and the whole People drink of them, and are refre&s;hed thereby; and every one will be ready to own the Cha|racter they bear, &s;tile them <HI>Gods, and Chil|dren of the Highe&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>And thus <HI>this Splended Title,</HI> given to Rulers, leads us to the <HI>Original de&s;ign</HI> of their <HI>In&s;titution,</HI> which is the <HI>Publick Good.</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="001484_0026_0FB354B6821A6BF0">
It tells us what the Governing de&s;ign of Government ought to be in all acts of Power whether <HI>Legi&s;lative</HI> or <HI>Executive:</HI> What Ble&s;&s;ings all Rulers ought to be, and <HI>Good Ones</HI> will be to a People.

<P>The very Nature of things, and the Primary Intention of GOD in the Ordina|tion
<PB N="25" REF="001484_0027_0FB354B9DDB51A40">
of Civil Government, certainly points us to the general Happine&s;s &amp; Pro&s;perity, which Rulers ought to have <HI>in view.</HI> The true mea&s;ure of Government we have a|greeably laid down by the Spirit of GOD, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23. 3.

<P>It was never de&s;igned either by GOD or Men; that &s;ome &s;hould be advanced to Power and Dignity, to rai&s;e their parti|cular Glory, either in Oppo&s;ition to, or Se|peration from the happine&s;s of the Pub|lick.

Rules of Government, and the particular Lawes Stated in a Land.

<P N="3">3.

<P>And <HI>as</HI> they are to <HI>Imitate GOD</HI> in the Sublime qualities of the <HI>Mind;</HI> &s;o in their <HI>Admini&s;trations.</HI> Rulers mu&s;t &s;et GODS Government before them, and endeavour to Form them&s;elves in their whole Ma|nagement by this perfect Model.

<P>Here it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that GOD, tho' He be <HI>Lord Paramount</HI> of Hea|ven and Earth; and his Sovereignty un|accountable, being Infinite, Ab&s;olute and Independent; yet He alwayes Exerci&s;es his Supream Authority according to the

<HI>Rules</HI> of the mo&s;t Con&s;ummate Wi&s;dom, Spotle&s;s Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Unblemi&s;h'd In|tegrity, and Diffu&s;ive Goodne&s;s.

<P>Hence Rulers, of all Orders, ought to conform to and regulate them&s;elves in all their Admini&s;trations, by this Divine Standard. Their Government &s;hould be a <HI>Tran&s;cript,</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;ible Image</HI> of the <HI>Di|vine Rule.</HI> And the more Exactly they conform to this Mea&s;ure; the nearer they approach in their Rule over Men to the Divine Pattern; the brighter will be the Characters of Divine Glory reflected on them; This Imitation of GOD is nece&s;&s;ary to Maintain the ju&s;t honours of their Station, to an&s;wer the End of their Elevation, and the de&s;ign of Government it &s;elf.

as to <HI>Sort,</HI> and <HI>Degree,</HI> to be proportioned to the &s;everal Characters, and Offices that are &s;u&s;tained: That Knowledge that may qualify for the <HI>Coun&s;el Board,</HI> may not for the <HI>Tribunal of Ju&s;tice:</HI> Superior Wi&s;dom is requi&s;ite for a Superior Station in Go|vernment: Yet every Order of Rulers mu&s;t have a due proportion of it.</P>
<P>Again, The State and Circum&s;tance of a People may be more perplexed, difficult, and intricate at one Day than an other; either by rea&s;on of the darkne&s;s and intri|cacy of Divine Providence, or the preva|lency of evil humours among a People them&s;elves: and &s;uch a day requires great|er force and light of Under&s;tanding in Ru|lers: A Storm requires greater &s;kill than a calm.</P>
<P>Thus the &s;tile of <HI>Gods</HI> requires that Ru|lers re&s;emble GOD in this Divine Excel|lency, that they may maintain their Glory, and an&s;wer the End of their Creation. There mu&s;t be Wi&s;dom to judge what Laws are proper to be made, and what Sanctions are proper to enforce them; there mu&s;t be Wi&s;dom to under&s;tand the Publick Powers, and Private Rights and

This comprehends in it a &s;uitable Know|lege of the complexion and humours of the People committed to their tru&s;t; what Di&s;tempers they are mo&s;t lyable to, and what Remedies mo&s;t proper for them, and what the right Sea&s;ons to make the Ap|plications whether for Prevention, or af|ter Remedy: There mu&s;t be &s;kill in the general Maxims of Government, and Pru|dence in a pertinent Application of the&s;e to Emergent ca&s;es, that by an orderly con|duct the great affairs &amp; de&s;igns of a State, be carry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d on to an happy Conclu&s;ion: There is to this requi&s;ite a Penetrating <HI>Sa|gacity</HI> to fore&s;ee Publick dangers, &amp; a &s;ea|&s;onable <HI>Precaution</HI> to guard again&s;t them: And for this End Rulers &s;hould be men of deep Thought, good Experience, and of great Pre&s;ence of Mind; that they may not be &s;hoved beyond their rea&s;on by a|ny unexpected Emergencies; but that

<P>Thus, they that are <HI>Gods</HI> among Men mu&s;t labour to partake of Divine Wi&s;dom, and re&s;emble GOD, who is wonderful in Coun&s;el, and excellent in Working.

<P><HI>Again,</HI> As <HI>Gods</HI> they mu&s;t not be in|fluenced by Private Advantage: It is un|godlike for Rulers to Cry, <HI>Give, Give.</HI> It is incon&s;i&s;tent with the End of Rule, and will be a deep &s;tain upon Government; when Ju&s;tice is Bought and Sold: and Ex|po&s;es Rulers to the Rebukes of a Righ|teous GOD; for the Tabernacles of Bri|bery peculiarly ly open to the Devouring Flames of Heaven.

Thus every King among the Phili&s;tines, upon their advancement a&s;&s;umed the appellati|on of <HI>Abimelech;</HI> the Engli&s;h of which is, the King my Father. Among the Romans, their Con&s;uls, Generals, and afterward their Emperors, were mo&s;t ambitious of the Name of Fathers, as the brighte&s;t Ti|tle of Honour.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Le Compte's Memoirs.</NOTE> And the be&s;t as well late&s;t accounts of <HI>China</HI> tell us, that it is a &s;tanding Maxim of that Government, that Kings are properly the <HI>Fathers</HI> of their People, and not <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> placed in the Throne to be Served by Slaves: And this Idea of their Prince is &s;o deeply imprinted in the Minds of all; that when any Pane|gyrick is made in prai&s;e of the <HI>Emperor,</HI> it is upon this head of his affection to his People; and form his Character not from

<P><HI>Again,</HI> A <HI>Steady Conduct</HI> in all their Ad|mini&s;trations is nece&s;&s;ary to create a <HI>Con|fidence.</HI> They mu&s;t govern them&s;elves by unalterable principles, and fixed Rules, and not by unaccountable humours, or ar|bitrary will, which is lyable to the great|e&s;t levity and incon&s;tancy.

<P>Thus we have taken a view of what is included and pointed at in the Divine Title, that GOD has Characterized Civil Rulers by; which was the Second thing ob&s;erved in the Text. We may proceed to the Third.</P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> That tho' Rulers are <HI>Gods,</HI> yet they are lyable to <HI>Mortality,</HI> and the nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Con&s;equents thereof, as Men.</HI> This truth is no Secret, but lyes open to the Ob&s;ervation of all; that to E&s;&s;ay an Ela|borate Confirmation of it is needle&s;s: However, it can't be improper by a few hints to Endeavour to awaken a lively &s;en&s;e hereof, that may affect the heart and life.</P>
<P>The Greate&s;t Men are but <HI>Spirits in Fle&s;h:</HI> They are of the &s;ame Make and Con&s;titution with others; That Decree of Heaven, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 27. has the &s;ame a&s;pect upon them, as upon the meane&s;t, and may not be di&s;anulled.

the Seeds of Mortality; which will in a little time bur&s;t a &s;under the bands by which the Soul and Body are held in Vi|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l Union.

What Prerogatives they may lay claim to on other accounts; yet here they &s;tand upon a Level. No Exter|nal Quality, nor Per&s;onal Endowment can be any Security from the Arre&s;ts of the King of Terrors.</P>
<P>Their Power can't over-awe, nor their Riches bribe Death. Where are all tho&s;e <HI>Sons of Fame,</HI> the Mighty, Rich and Ho|nourable, we read of in Story! The Kings, and Princes that filled their hou&s;es with Gold and Silver, and the Coun&s;ellours of the Earth! Are they not gone to Sleep in tho&s;e <HI>de&s;olate Places</HI> they built for them|&s;elves! Are not all the Bright Stars of the Morning cover'd with the dark Cloud of Corruption! Where are tho&s;e Children of Pride &amp; Oppre&s;&s;ion, who made the Earth to tremble, &s;hook Kingdoms, made the World as a Wilderne&s;s, and de&s;troyed

the Cities thereof! How are they fallen, their pomp brought down to the Grave, and become as weak as the meane&s;t of their Va&s;&s;als! The Worm is &s;pread under them, and the Worm covers them. Again, Wi&s;dom and Policy cannot protect them from Mortality; for the Wi&s;e dy as well as the Fool. Courage will not; for Death cannot be Conquered but by that <HI>Prince of Life,</HI> who has triumphed over Death, and is the <HI>Life</HI> &amp; the <HI>Re&s;urrection:</HI> So that after all their breath mu&s;t go forth, and they return to Corruption.</P>
<P>As they are lyable to Death, &s;o <HI>as Men</HI> they are lyable to the Con&s;equents of Mortality. Their Bodies will undergo the &s;ame Mortifying Changes and Cor|ruption in the <HI>Land of Darkne&s;s,</HI> which the Bodies of others undergo. <HI>As Men,</HI> their Spirits when &s;eperated from their Bodies, will not drop into a State of in|activity, in&s;en&s;ibility; nor &s;hall be arre&s;ted with a Mortal Lethargy; but their Seperate Souls, will pa&s;s into the Un&s;een World of Unbodyed Spirits, and be &s;ubject to the Laws &amp; Government, to the Work and Rewards of <HI>that World:</HI> They will during

that State of Separation be either United to the Society of <HI>Angels</HI> and <HI>happy Souls,</HI> or be herded with the <HI>degraded Angels,</HI> and <HI>unhappy Spirits</HI> of dead men: they will, during this State of Death, either tremble at the fore-&s;ight of their re-union to their Ancient Bodies; or wait and long in this State of Expectancy for the Re|demption of their Bodies. <HI>As Men,</HI> they are <HI>Accountable,</HI> as well as <HI>Mortal;</HI> and mu&s;t appear before the Tribunal of GOD, who <HI>Re&s;pecteth not the Per&s;ons of Princes:</HI> A State either of Immortal ble&s;s, or mi&s;e|ry Expects them after Death: So that <HI>as Men</HI> they are to dye, and have &s;omething to fear, or hope for, beyond the Grave.</P>
<P>Thus Death and the inevitable Con&s;e|quents of it, have an equal A&s;pect upon Rulers and Ruled. And what a terrible Rebuke is this to the pre&s;ent Pride and Grandeur of <HI>Gods</HI> on Earth? And what happy Influence might the ju&s;t Contem|plation hereof have to implant &amp; nouri&s;h tho&s;e Seeds of Vertue, which may give them a ble&s;&s;ed Pro&s;pect of more Sub&s;tan|tial, Weighty &amp; Enduring Glories in that State, where there &s;hall be no more Death!

<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>The&s;e Reflections</HI> will teach Rulers not to <HI>over-rate and value</HI> their pre&s;ent Advantages of Honour, and Power over Men. It is of the la&s;t Con&s;equence to them that they do not Place too great a Price upon their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of Superiority: Now the&s;e thoughts will read them wi&s;e Le&s;&s;ons of the Vanity of the&s;e things; and bring them under a full Conviction of the truth of the P&s;al|mi&s;ts Conclu&s;ion: <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 39 5. <HI>Surely every
<PB N="63" REF="001484_0065_0FB3552240FA0000">
Man at his be&s;t E&s;tate is altogether Vanity.</HI> That can't be very valuable to Immortal Beings, which is not <HI>durable;</HI> but in a lit|tle time will be lo&s;t. And this is the ca&s;e of the pre&s;ent Advantages which men En|joy above others. <HI>Death</HI> cau&s;es all titles of Honour to bur&s;t into Air and nothing as Empty bubbles. It di&s;arms the Great of all their Power, and they go naked in|to the other World. After all their Pomp and Parade on the &s;tage of Life, they drop into their Graves, and nothing of all their <HI>Glory de&s;cends after them. Death</HI> wre&s;ts the Sceptre out of the Monarchs hand, plucks the Crown from off his head, and turns his Glory into noi&s;ome Putrefaction: and the very fore-thought of it will &s;tain the Pride of all their Glory. Hence <HI>Right Reflections</HI> on their <HI>Mortality</HI> will &s;ugge&s;t to &s;uch as Sit at the upper End of the World, wi&s;er thoughts of their pre&s;ent State of Exaltation; and will teach them that there can be no <HI>true Greatne&s;s,</HI> but what is found in Conjunction with <HI>Immortaliz|ing Goodne&s;s;</HI> and that without this inhe|rent Greatne&s;s of Soul, their external ad|vantages of Honour, Power, and Superio|rity
<PB N="64" REF="001484_0066_0FB355235FB8E538">
will &s;ignify nothing; unle&s;s when a|bu&s;ed, &amp; prided in, to make their Account more terrible; and their Infamy and Shame more deep and in&s;ufferable, when they &s;hall be fixed in the Congregation of GOD's conquered Enemies.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>The&s;e Thoughts</HI> will be a Powerful <HI>Antidote</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Infection</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Temptations,</HI> that threaten them in their Exalted Stations. Rulers have the &s;ame Lu&s;ts within them, as other men; and are be&s;et with much &s;tronger Temptations to provoke and inflame the&s;e Lu&s;ts. Sa|tan will be mo&s;t bu&s;y with &s;uch to corrupt and pervert them; and their falls will give the Wrath and Malice of Hell a di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Triumph. The World with its highe&s;t charms, and greate&s;t advantage to bewitch them: And as they have greater advantages than <HI>Others</HI> to pur&s;ue the mo&s;t guilty gratifications; &s;o they have fewer re&s;traints, and le&s;s of ob&s;truction in their way. They have enough to &s;hock and try the mo&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hed vertue. How ma|ny wayes are they tempted! And in dan|ger of &s;ullying their Divine Character, by being lead to Pride and Vanity, Sloth and
<PB N="65" REF="001484_0067_0FB35524E03E6500">
Luxury, Covetou&s;ne&s;s and Oppre&s;&s;ion. They need to keep the &s;tricte&s;t guard, and lay the &s;evere&s;t re&s;traints upon them&s;elves, to &s;ecure them from their Spiritual dan|gers.</P>
<P>Now ju&s;t <HI>Reflections</HI> on <HI>Death</HI> and its <HI>Con&s;equents</HI> will awaken in them &s;uch thoughts, as will tend to check, and rein in tho&s;e lu&s;ts, that the charms of Great|ne&s;s do excite. If they remember they mu&s;t dye, how can they grow giddy, or be unrea&s;onably tran&s;ported with the glit|tering Images of their pre&s;ent honours? Will not this thought damp the force of Temptations to Luxury and Sen&s;uality; and cool them in the hot pur&s;uit of forbid|den plea&s;ures? What Appetite had <HI>Bel|&s;hazzar,</HI> when he &s;aw and under&s;tood <HI>the hand writing on the Wall,</HI> to carry on the Revel, and compleat the debauch? This pro&s;pect will pall the unhallowed Appe|tite of Dominion, and Gain; and will make them think what agonies and cor|vul&s;ions the remembrance of gain gotten by Inju&s;tice and Oppre&s;&s;ion, will cau&s;e in a dying hour; and what inflaming Items, the charge of Power, Riches, and Honour
<PB N="66" REF="001484_0068_0FB355263336A438">
abu&s;ed, and perverted, will be at that Impartial Tribunal they mu&s;t &s;tand before. Thus the&s;e <HI>Reflections</HI> will be of mighty force to abate the Edge of Temptation; and they will give them a ju&s;ter view of things, as they &s;tand in the <HI>Light</HI> of the other World: In&s;tructing them, that if they mu&s;t dye, and be judg|ed like men, then they may not live like <HI>Creatures,</HI> either of <HI>Prey</HI> or <HI>Plea&s;ure.</HI> And were the&s;e thoughts more frequently En|tertained and Realized by the Superior part of the World, what a mighty pro|tection would they be from tho&s;e threat|ning Evils, which if indulged, will deba&s;e their Character, cloud their Serenity of Con&s;cience, and lay their Souls <HI>wa&s;te</HI> and <HI>de&s;olate.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) The&s;e <HI>Thoughts</HI> of <HI>Mortality</HI> and its Con&s;equents will be mo&s;t forcible <HI>Ar|guments</HI> and <HI>Motives</HI> to engage Rulers &s;o to improve the Advantages of Honour and Power, as may give them the be&s;t pro&s;pect of a State of Immortality.

do good to the World.

Now the&s;e Reflections on Death and its Con&s;equents tend to engage them to a <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> improvement of the&s;e Talents committed to them: They will incite them to &s;tudy &s;uch a Management in their Places, as &s;hall in the Review not Torment but Comfort them, when the Shadows of Death &s;tretch over them. This Pro&s;pect will make them value their &s;tate of Di&s;tinction and Superiority, not by its pre&s;ent glittering Appearance, but by their greater Capacity for Service for GOD, his Kingdom and People. This will con&s;train them to think, what good they have Opportunity to do, that they

may not neglect it; but get it done before Death periods their Sea&s;ons of Improve|ment: It will in&s;pire them with the mo&s;t noble purpo&s;es; that they may fill up their Places, and be <HI>Gods</HI> to the World while they live. In this way their Death|beds will be Places of Inconceiveable re|fre&s;hment; and have confidence in their Appearance before the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>Man:</HI> Their fidelity will fill all their Powers with the warme&s;t Tran&s;ports of joy in that Terrible day of the Lord: while at the &s;ame time the Kings of the Earth, the Great Men, the Rich, and Mighty Men, that have a|bu&s;ed and not improved their Talents, &s;hall &s;tand <HI>Trembling</HI> before the Supream bar of CHRIST, over-powred with the Terrors of the LORD, from who&s;e Wrath <HI>Rocks</HI> &amp; <HI>Mountains</HI> can give no Protection.

A State of Mortality be&s;peaks a State of Sin, and Moral Infir|mity: for Death is the puni&s;hment of Sin; and were all the Seeds of Sin purged out, Death would have no power over them.
