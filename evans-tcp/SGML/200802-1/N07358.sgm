<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>_THE repeated Application, of &s;ome Gentlemen, who were pre&s;ent when this Di&s;cour&s;e was de|livered, has &s;o far prevailed with me, as to give them a Copy for the Pre&s;s, tho' with &s;ome Reluctancy. The Author does not pre|tend to any Thing refined or extraordinary: He acknow|ledges there are many Di&s;cour&s;es on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, already publi&s;hed, that far exceed; prepared by Gentlemen of grea|ter Parts, Ability and Reading, than he pretends to. The Author tho't it would be decent at lea&s;t, and a Point of Manners, to wait the Approbation of that worthy Gentle|man and Scholar, who&s;e Place he &s;upplyed, and for whom, he &s;hall always have a Veneration and Regard; which was no &s;mall Inducement to procra&s;tinate. Sen&s;ible at the &s;ame Time, that he was within the Reach of cold Critici&s;m, and expo&s;ed to the Envy and Malice of Bigotry, &s;ince the con|&s;cientious Change of his Per&s;ua&s;ion; which has cau&s;ed E|nemies almo&s;t innumerable, on every Side, which makes his Situation, as he apprehends, very dangerous: Enemies &s;piteful and malicious, &s;uch as no Man would &s;uppo&s;e could po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t on this Side the infernal Regions, was there not &s;uch a notorious Specimen exhibited&punc;&mdash; For Chri&s;tians that profe&s;s one Lord, one Faith, and one Bapti&s;m, to load one another with Cur&s;es and Imprecations, is very &s;hocking.&mdash; The lea&s;t Attention to that divine Religion, would doubtle&s;s prevent the ca&s;ting forth in this &s;portive Manner, Fire-Brands, Arrows and Death; and &s;ilence tho&s;e uncharitable and cruel Wi&s;hes, which it is to be hoped will never come either upon the Per&s;on that now writes, or upon his Enemies.&mdash;
<PB N="vi" REF="009391_0004_0F7343C693BF5410">
Be it known to the&s;e Per&s;ons, that God Almighty will not be dictated by Wi&s;hes, and that Wi&s;hing will never alter any wi&s;e De&s;ign of his. If God plea&s;es to make the Sea my Grave, I am contented: But I would remind &s;uch Per&s;ons, that after Death, comes the Judgment We mu&s;t all ap|pear before the Tribunal, meet together before our Judge; then all Controver&s;y will cea&s;e forever, our Lord and Ma&s;ter will then make known the true Followers of the Lamb. &mdash; I can a&s;&s;ure tho&s;e mine Enemies, that I am not a&s;hamed of my Profe&s;&s;ion, neither is there any Doubt in my Mind with Regard to the Solidity of the Foundation upon which I build, tho' &s;ome are plea&s;ed to call it Wood, Hay, Stubble, &amp;c. And I am willing to &s;uffer Martyrdom in Body as well as Character, as long as I build upon Chri&s;t the Foun|dation.&mdash; My only De&s;ire is, that I may enjoy the Privi|ledge of an Engli&s;hman, viz. Liberty of Con&s;cience, which is indulged my Enemies: Always de&s;iring to have the Ad|vancement of my Redeemer's Kingdom in View.</P>
<P>I would acquaint the Reader, that I have con&s;ulted the be&s;t of Authors upon the Subject, and made U&s;e of them, where it &s;uited. If this Di&s;cour&s;e proves &s;erviceable to reclaim the Athei&s;tical Thinker, or furni&s;hes the Reader with any new Ideas with Regard to divine Providence, I &s;hall not regret the Publication.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Revelation of St. <HI>John,</HI> has been e&s;teemed by all learned &amp; judicious Men, &s;ince the Religion of the great Emanuel diffu&s;ed Light and Life, thro' Nations that &s;at in Darkne&s;s, and the Shadow of Death; to be the mo&s;t difficult &amp; my&s;te|rious Part of the Bible. It has indeed puzzled the bright|e&s;t Genius, in it's Endeavours to inve&s;tigate the My&s;teries recorded in this Book &mdash;Many Things are accompli&s;hing, and perhaps accompli&s;hed, concerning my&s;tical Babylon, or Rome papal.&mdash;We all with earne&s;t Expectation wait, the ble&s;&s;ed, glorious and joyful Time, when the Man of Sin &s;hall be de&s;troyed&mdash;When my&s;tical Babylon, that my|&s;tery of Iniquity, fraught with the Wages of Sin, &s;hall be hurried with the greate&s;t Precipitation (by the divine

Permi&s;&s;ion) into the Aby&s;s of Oblivion &amp; Non-exi&s;tence&mdash; Then &s;hall the glorious millennial State dawn, when the Church of God, (whereof the Temple on Mount Zion was a Type)&mdash; <HI>The Mountain of the Lord's Hou&s;e, &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Top of the Mountains, and exalted above the Hills, and all Nations &s;hall flow unto it.</HI>&mdash; When one of tho&s;e bright Intelligences, who inhabit Realms inacce&s;&s;ible to Mortals here below, <HI>&s;hall fly thro' the mid&s;t of Heaven, having the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, to preach unto all tho&s;e that dwell on the Earth, to every Na|tion and Kindred, and Tongue, and People.</HI>&mdash;But why this Digre&s;&s;ion&mdash;My Hearers, I &s;hall not pretend to dive into this Bathos; but gently glide upon the Surface; le&s;t by endeavouring to plunge into the Aby&s;s, I &s;hould find it unfathomable, and difficult with Ea&s;e or Decency, to emerge from its Profundity.</P>
<P>I take the Words read at this Time for a Theme &s;ui|table, as I &s;uppo&s;e, to expand Fancy's Wing, in order to expatiate upon the <HI>magnalia Dei,</HI> the great Things of God.&mdash;How great &amp; marvellous all his Works of Crea|tion, and Providence are; and I might more e&s;pecially treat of the marvellous Work of our Redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t: But that I mu&s;t leave; as the Occa&s;ion of our meeting together, naturally leads us largely to treat of God's marvellous Works of Providence. &mdash; I &s;hall but gently glide along upon the Surface of the fir&s;t, in the Skiff of my natural &amp; artificial Abilities, and &s;o declaim more largely upon the latter: Such as the great and mar|vellous Works of God's Providence towards us in Years pa&s;t; in pro&s;pering the Briti&s;h Arms; in granting us Pro&s;|perity; e&s;pecially this Year, and the la&s;t, in &s;etting Pro&s;|perity and Adver&s;ity, the one over again&s;t the other.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things loudly call upon us, to recollect; and may they make a la&s;ting Impre&s;&s;ion upon our Minds; &s;o that we may teach them to our Children, that the&s;e mighty Acts of the Lord may be known by &s;ucceed|ing

Generations. All Things which ari&s;e to our View, on the Surface of this Earth, at the Call and Command of the great Architect, aro&s;e from the primordial Ma&s;s.&mdash; <HI>The invi&s;ible Things of him from the Creation of the World, are clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the Things that are made; even his eternal Power and Godhead.</HI> His <HI>Power,</HI> in being able with &s;o much Ea&s;e and Expedition, to rear and uphold &s;o va&s;t a Fabrick &mdash; His <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> in contriving &s;uch a beautiful Sy&s;tem of Things, dige&s;ting them &s;o fitly, and connecting them &s;o firmly, and in &s;uch harmonious Order.&mdash; And his <HI>God|head,</HI> in being the Author of all tho&s;e Beauties and Per|fections; all tho&s;e Splendors and Magnificences, which we behold with &s;o much Plea&s;ure and Wonder; in the Contemplation of which, the Heathen were carried away in poetic Rapture; which &s;ometimes terminated in Hymns and Eulogies to the World's Creator.</P>
<P>In my de&s;cant on Creation, I &s;hall not trouble you with Geographical Certainties, or A&s;tronomical Niceties; but proceed in ju&s;t Gradation intelligible to all; forming my Plan upon that of the holy Penman, (in the fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is.</HI>) directed by unerring Wi&s;dom: &mdash; And &s;hall fix my Ob&s;ervations more e&s;pecially, on tho&s;e great and marvellous Works of Jehovah, on this Terra|queous Globe, con&s;picuous to a contemplative Mind,&mdash; This Terraqueous Globe, which all-bounteous Heaven de&s;igned for our pre&s;ent Abode.&mdash;Not being wholly con|fined to this Terre&s;tial Habitation, being nece&s;&s;itated, perhaps my Thot's may &s;ometimes &s;oar upon Contem|plation's Wings, to the &s;tarry Region. This Abode of Mortals, differs from the Cele&s;tial, as it was formed out of pre-exi&s;tent Matter, which probably they were not; But then the Ma&s;s out of which it aro&s;e, was <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Ovid.</HI></NOTE> rude and undige&s;ted, and unapt of it&s;elf to receive the beautiful

Form which the almighty Arti&s;t put upon it, &s;o as to de|&s;erve, tho' in a &s;econdary Sen&s;e only, the Name of a Creation &mdash; So that we may ju&s;tly be tran&s;ported, and join the comprehen&s;ive Strain in the Text&mdash; <HI>Great and marvellous</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>That the World by &s;ome powerful, yea, omnipotent Agent, was created out of a Chaos, a confu&s;ed, inordi|nate Heap of Matter, is evident from the Hi&s;tories of the mo&s;t ancient Nations, and the Te&s;timonies of their be&s;t Authors.&mdash; And this is no ways repugnant to Scripture, but agreeable thereto; for it is manife&s;t from the De&s;|cription <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> gives of the Creation, where he &s;ays, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. Bp. <HI>Patrick,</HI> in loc.</NOTE> <HI>In the Beginning God created the Earth,</HI> i.e the Matter whereof the Chaos was compo&s;ed, <HI>which was with|out Form,</HI> without any Shape or Order; <HI>and void,</HI> with|out any Thing living, or growing in it; and <HI>Darkne&s;s was upon the Face of the Waters:</HI> nothing was &s;een for want of Light which lay buried in this va&s;t Aby&s;s.</P>
<P>"The in&s;pired Penman, by the Chaos, &s;eems to give us an idea of a fluid Ma&s;s, wherein the Seeds and Prin|ciples of all Things were blended together, and mingled in Confu&s;ion, &s;o that heavy and light, den&s;e and rare, fluid and &s;olid Particles, were all in wild Confu&s;ion and Di&s;order."&mdash;</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved, that before the holy Penman in|forms us what particular Creatures were each Day &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively brought into Being, (as a Thing e&s;&s;ential and pre|paratory to the Work) he tells us, <HI>That the Spirit of God moved upon the Face of the Waters.</HI> Whether by the Spirit of God, we are to under&s;tand his holy and e&s;&s;ential Spirit, which is the third Per&s;on in the ever-ble&s;&s;ed Trinity, or the Spirit of the Me&s;&s;iah, as &s;ome of the antient Jews have under&s;tood it; or that pla&s;tick Nature, which according to &s;ome, was made &s;ub&s;ervient to him upon this Occa&s;ion, or &s;ome other Emanation of
<PB N="11" REF="009391_0006_0F7343CB9304C640" MS="y">
the divine Power; we may rationally &s;uppo&s;e, that its Incubation or Brooding (as it literally &s;ignifies) upon the Chaotick Ma&s;s, not only &s;eparated tho&s;e Parts which were jumbled together, but impregnated it with &s;everal Kinds of vital Influence, or gave a vivifick Vertue, to produce what was contained in it, &s;o as to make it capable of Di&s;po&s;ition and Order.&mdash; <HI>Great and Marvellous</HI>!&mdash;</P>
<P>In this State, we may &s;uppo&s;e the Chaos to have been, when the <HI>Fiat</HI> for Light was given, on the fir&s;t Day.&mdash; Whereupon all the confu&s;ed, &s;tagnating Princi|ples of Matter, began to range into Form and Order the terrene Parts which over-clouded the Expan&s;um, at the Summons given, retired to their re&s;pective Centers, viz. the Planets: And as the gro&s;&s;er Parts &s;ub&s;ided, the lighter and more tenuous mounted up, and meeting to|gether in a Body, were then put into a circular Motion, &s;o as to vi&s;it the whole Expan&s;um of the Chaos; This was not only to &s;eparate the Light from the Darkne&s;s, and make a Di&s;tribution of Day and Night, but to faci|litate the Work too, and forward the Dige&s;tion of the remaining Parts of Creation.</P>
<P>Thus the bright and active Element of Fire was ex|tracted from the chaotick Ma&s;s. This was for the pre|&s;ent to influence the upper Parts of the Chaos, and to be the In&s;trument of Rarefaction, and all the re&s;t of the Operations, which were nece&s;&s;ary to mould it into &s;uch Creatures as were afterwards brought into Being&mdash; Great and Marvellous!&mdash;</P>
<P>On the &s;econd Day of Creation, the beautiful Ele|ment of Air was extracted, when before Water lay un|di&s;tingui&s;hably di&s;per&s;ed, in the Expan&s;ion of the Chaos, and together with the Aether, made a pellucid Body.</P>
<P>The next Thing to be done; was to make a Divi|&s;ion of the&s;e Waters, and di&s;tribute them in proper Por|tions to their re&s;pective Planets; which is taken to be the meaning of the <HI>Waters above the Firmament.</HI>&mdash;The
<PB N="12" REF="009391_0007_0F7343CB9A797B28">
Almighty gave Command and all the aqueous Parts of the great Pellucid &s;ub&s;ided towards their Centers, and cir|cumfu&s;ed about their Globes. &mdash; The Waters under the Firmament, were divided from the Waters above the Fir|mament; the Waters of the Earth of the Moon and other Planets which before this Day lay confu&s;edly di&s;per&s;ed in the Expan&s;um were divided.</P>
<P>The watry Particles on the third Day having cleared the Expan&s;um, and falling upon the Planetary Orbs, covered the Face of the Earth as well as other Planets; the great Creator gave command for <HI>the Waters to be gathered into one Place, and the dry Land to appear.</HI> Then the mighty Mountains in&s;tantaneou&s;ly reared their lofty Heads&mdash; and the Waters with tremendous Roar, flowing from their enormous Sides filled the wide extended Valleys.&mdash;Tho&s;e Vales which the &s;welling of the Earth in &s;ome Places, had made in others for the Reception of the Waters, which &s;eems to be countenan|ced by the P&s;almi&s;t: <HI>The Waters &s;tanding above the Mountains, at thy Rebuke they fled, at the Voice of thy Thunder</HI> (perhaps an Earthquake which is &s;ubterranean Thunder) <HI>they ha&s;ted away, and went down to the Valleys beneath, even unto the Place which thou had&s;t prepared for them.</HI>&mdash; And by Jehovah him&s;elf, who is introduced thus &s;peaking in the Book of <HI>Job I break up for the Sea, my decreed Place, and &s;et Bars and Doors.</HI></P>
<P>After this, the Almighty Jehovah gave Command, and the Earth was covered over with verdant Herbage, the gay Green, which is Nature's univer&s;al Robe&mdash;Vegeta|bles of all Kinds were then produced in full Proportion, laden with Fruit, and not &s;ubjected to the ordinary way of Maturation, by virtue of a &s;upernatural Power, given by the great Artichect; notwith&s;tanding the fecundity of the primigenial Earth, beyond what it is &s;ince the Fall of Mankind; it is rational to &s;uppo&s;e &s;omething &s;uper|natural, if we con&s;ider the Space of Time, in which the
<PB N="13" REF="009391_0007_0F7343CB9A797B28">
Thing was accompli&s;hed&mdash;Great and marvellous are his Works!&mdash;</P>
<P>After the All-powerful Jehovah had fini&s;hed this lower World, the divine Hi&s;torian carries us upon Con|templation's Wing, to the &s;tarry Region&mdash; Let us then, with him, hover a while in the Regions above, and take a View of tho&s;e Luminaries that rule the Day &amp; Night, the Work of the fourth Day.</P>
<P>The Moon, as well as the other Planets, mu&s;t be &s;up|po&s;ed to go along with the Earth in its Formation, and to advance in Proportion, tho' it is not &s;aid to be made be|fore the reflected Rays of the Sun made it vi&s;ible to the Earth &mdash;That flaming Light, which is of different Make and Matter, and which moved around the chaotick Ma&s;s, having u&s;ed its Influence, in producing the Aether, in the &s;eparation of the Water, and the Arefaction of the Earth; the omnipotent Agent, on this fourth Day, ca&s;t into a proper Orb; for no Doubt, had its Duration been lon|ger, the Heat would have been too inten&s;e, both for the Production and Con&s;ervation of the human and bru|tal Species.&mdash; As was &s;aid before, the Almighty placed it at a convenient Di&s;tance from the Earth, and other Planets; giving it a duplicate Motion to di&s;tingui&s;h the Day from the Night, and to mark out the various Sea|&s;ons of the Year, Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter, and by Con&s;equence, the Sea&s;ons for ploughing, &s;owing, planting, pruning, reaping, vintage, &s;ailing &amp;c. and form|ed it into that glorious Luminary, we are every Day &s;o much indebted to, and view &s;o often with Admiration&mdash; Wonderful are the Works of God, his Ways incompre|hen&s;ible to Mortals!</P>
<P>Let us re-vi&s;it the Habitation of Mortals, having glan|ced upon the marvellous Works of the Deity in the For|mation of inanimate Creatures; we &s;hall now proceed, with the holy Penman, to the animate; the Work of the fifth Day &mdash; Beginning with the le&s;s, and going on

to the more perfect; until we come with the mo&s;aick Hi&s;tory, to the top of the animal Creation: which is Man &mdash;</P>
<P>With va&s;t Amazement, we may view the innumera|ble Multitude of Fi&s;h that inhabit the Deep, and Fowl that mount on high in Air, which by the almighty Fiat, were in an in&s;tant produced out of Matter, as it was mixed with Water, which contained many Things be|&s;ides Water in the Simple&mdash;The great Congruity there is in their Natures, is a &s;ufficient Indication of this &mdash; <HI>Let the Waters bring forth abundance</HI> (&s;ays God); immediately the Command is obeyed, and the Waters <HI>bring forth abundantly</HI>&mdash;So that we may naturally &s;up|po&s;e, that many Individuals were at fir&s;t created.&mdash; Again, there &s;eems to be &s;omething peculiar, in ble&s;&s;ing his Creatures; of which there is no mention made be|fore.&mdash;Here he bids them to be fruitful &amp; multiply <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Limborch</HI>'s Theolg.</NOTE>&mdash; and marvellou&s;ly we behold a prolific Virtue, and a na|tural In&s;tinct for Generation; &s;o that they may pre|&s;erve their Species, and multiply their Individuals.</P>
<P>Every Thing being put into marvellous Order by Omnipotence it &s;elf &mdash; The Earth covered with Her|bage&mdash; The Waters &s;tored with finny Inhabitants &mdash; The Air repleni&s;hed with the winged Tribes&mdash;And that Fire which moved round the chaotick Ma&s;s, placed at &s;uch a convenient Di&s;tance, &s;o as to give Warmth and Nou|ri&s;hment to them all; and that this &s;ublunary Abode might be more comfortable for the mo&s;t noble of all God's Works, even Man.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the &s;ixth and la&s;t Day, terre&s;trial Animals were created; the &s;avage Bea&s;ts that range the Wood; all tame and dome&s;tick Creatures for the U&s;e of Man, con&s;tituted Vicegerent here below&mdash; and creep|ing Things innumerable, the mo&s;t odious to the human Species, of any of the Creation of God.&mdash;<HI>GOD made

the Bea&s;ts, and every Thing that creepeth, after his Kind.</HI>&mdash; Great and marvellous are thy Works, O Lord God Almighty!</P>
<P>Every Thing being made &s;ub&s;ervient to a rational in|telligent Being, in order to advance his Felicity&mdash; The Light had penetrated into, and clarified the dark and thick Atmo&s;phere&mdash;The Air was freed from noxious Vapours, and fitted for Re&s;piration &mdash; The Waters &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, as to afford Mi&s;ts and Dews from Heaven; Springs and Rivers from the Earth, to &s;upply Man's Nece&s;&s;ities.&mdash;The Earth was now &s;olid for his Support, was covered with Trees, Shrubs, and Vegetables of all Kinds, for Su&s;tenance and Delight.&mdash;The glorious Fir|mament on High, with all the blue aetherial Region, and &s;hining Frame of the &s;pangled Heavens, was laid open to Contemplation, and the Luminaries by their powerful Influences, put in &s;uch Order as to di&s;tingui&s;h the Sea&s;ons, and make the World a delicious, and plea|&s;ant Habitation&mdash;In &s;hort, when all Sorts of Animals, in Air, Seas, and Earth, were contrived by infinite Wi&s;|dom, &s;o as to contribute in their &s;everal Capacities for Benefit and Delight; then Man was created, and brought upon the Stage &mdash;Then he was con&s;tituted by the Almighty, Lord and Governor of the whole, in which his Honor and Dignity were con&s;ulted&mdash; In an In&s;tant of Time, the great Protopla&s;t was made in full Perfection.</P>
<P>But perhaps the Thing will make a &s;tronger Impre&s;|&s;ion on our Minds, if we &s;uppo&s;e the Figure of Man to ri&s;e by Degrees, and fini&s;hed Part by Part, in a Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of Time&mdash;That when the whole was compleat|ed, the Veins and Arteries bored, the Sinews and Ten|dons laid, the Joints fitted, and the Liquor tran&s;mutable into Blood and Juices, lodged in the Ventricles of the Heart, God infu&s;ing into it a Principle of Life: after which, the Liquor in the Heart begins to de&s;cend, and

<P>This is an In&s;tance of his Perfection, that he is not limited to the u&s;e of material Organs, &s;uch In&s;truments as we make u&s;e of&mdash;Not to need tho&s;e Helps which we need; which are a thou&s;and, and ten thou&s;and Times &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by the Immen&s;ity of that E&s;&s;ence, which is every where at once, &s;o as to penetrate all Things with|in, like an univer&s;al Soul, and contain all Things with|out, like an univer&s;al Place &mdash;</P>

<P>We will then take a &s;hort View of &s;ome Parts of his Providence, in order to conceive how ju&s;t the Ob&s;erva|tion of the P&s;almi&s;t is, viz. <HI>That the Eyes of all wait upon God, who opens his Hand, and fills all things liv|ing, with Plenteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>If we look upon the Earth, our pre&s;ent Abode, we can|not but perceive its Fruitfulne&s;s, in Animals and Vegi|tables &mdash;A variety of Trees, all laden with Delicacies, who&s;e Seeds are in them&s;elves, in order for their Con|tinuance.&mdash;A variety of delightful Flowers, wonderful in their make.&mdash;Grains of all Sorts, for Man's Support; and Herbs of all Kinds, both for Food and Phy&s;ick, ri|&s;ing con&s;picuous to our view on its Surface.&mdash; And yet the Earth out of which the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings are produced, is a cold Ma&s;s of Matter, de&s;titute of Warmth and proli|fick Virtue.</P>
<P>If we take a View, as we pa&s;s into the Region of A|nimals, we cannot but ob&s;erve, the &s;ingular Beauty and Strength, that &s;ome of them are endowed with; others have great Sagacity: All, how &s;avage &s;oever in their

<P>I &s;hall not expatiate any further, over the &s;everal Tribes of Animals&mdash;But go on in regular Progre&s;&s;ion to another Act of God's Providence; his con&s;tant Concur|rence, and Co-operation with all Things.</P>
<P>As God's E&s;&s;ence is in every Place, &s;o is his Power ex|tended to all Things; the proper End of his Power is Acti|on, and con&s;equently where the Deity is, there it mu&s;t be acting&mdash; The Parts of Matter, in what Order &s;oever we may &s;uppo&s;e them to be di&s;po&s;ed, neither gravitate, nor communicate Motion, nor in any Re&s;pect, act upon one another, but in Con&s;equence of God's immediate and marvellou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ting Hand. What are the Motions of all the heavenly Bodies, and their regular &s;ucceeding Revolutions&mdash;The Revolution of Day and Night, and the return of annual Sea&s;ons, but the marvellous Work of Almighty God?</P>
<P>Again, with regard to the vegetable World: They have neither Sen&s;e nor Rea&s;on to di&s;cern the Periods of their growth, yet before they wither and die, they run up into Seed, as if they fore&s;aw their approaching End, and &s;o were &s;olicitous to leave a numerous Po&s;terity be|hind them.&mdash; What is this, but the marvellous Co-ope|ration of God Almighty.</P>
<P>I might de&s;cant largely upon the Concurrence and Co-operation of God's Providence, as to the brute and irrational World; but what has been &s;aid, is enough to &s;uffice any Per&s;on of Contemplation.</P>
<P>I proceed then to take a View of the rational World.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to &s;ay, that Man acts without the Concurrence and Co-operation of Almighty God, in whom we live and move and have our Being: To &s;up|po&s;e the contrary, would be impious, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the Dependence we owe to our great Creator.&mdash;
<PB N="20" REF="009391_0011_0F7343CE9A6CB1B8">
But this I mu&s;t &s;ay, and I hope without Offence to any Per&s;ons that allow them&s;elves to exerci&s;e the Faculty of thinking, indulged them by the Creator, tho' at the &s;ame Time, I think my &s;elf under no Obligation to plea&s;e any particular Sect in Religion; but to &s;peak the Sentiments of the Heart, not to pin my Faith upon the Antinomian Sleeve, or to imbibe any Notion &s;tarted by the fiery Homo-thumadon Brethren; that the Ca&s;e is not with Men as with Brutes. God has not only en|dowed him with natural Powers, and Principles of Action, but an Under&s;tanding and Will too, whereby he judges, rea&s;ons and determines for him&s;elf&mdash; and therefore it is thought by the Judicious, that the divine Co-operation, with re&s;pect to Man, &s;eems to extend no farther, than the natural Power of acting, and not to any &s;pecifick Acts. It makes no Alteration in the Powers of Nature, but only enables them to act according to their Natures: God &s;ets the&s;e Powers a going indeed, but gives them no preter-natural Motion&punc; this is &s;omething like the wind|ing up of a Watch, leaving its Motion to be guided by its Springs and Wheels. Marvellous indeed is this Work of God!</P>
<P>The Scene opens to our View a fourth Act of God's Providence; viz. The Government of Cau&s;es, natural, accidental and moral. &mdash;All natural Cau&s;es are under the immediate and ab&s;olute Government of God: He keeps the Springs of Nature in his Hands, and turns them as he plea&s;es.&mdash; He guides the heavenly Bodies, impre&s;&s;es the Degree, and chalks out the Path of their Motions&mdash; His almighty Hand turns round tho&s;e &s;tupendous Wheels, in a perpetual Revolution. This is evident from the Expo&s;tulation God holds with Job&mdash; <HI>Knowe&s;t thou the Ordinances of Heaven, and can&s;t thou &s;et the Dominion thereof on the Earth?</HI> &amp;c. There are indeed different Virtues and Powers be&s;towed by God, on natural Cau|&s;es; in ordinary Ca&s;es he makes u&s;e of the&s;e Powers to

Changes and Revolutions, which many Times happen in Kingdoms and States.

<P N="2">2. From what has been &s;aid in the preceeding Di&s;|cour&s;e; let us learn &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Divine Will&mdash; For after we have affected our Minds with a due Sen&s;e of the Divine Super-intendency, in every Thing that be|falls us, the next Thing to be done, is to compo&s;e our Souls into a humble Submi&s;&s;ion to the Almighty's Will, &s;o that we may bear with Decency the Sufferings he lays upon us, and continue in the State in which God has placed us, with content.

<P>Tho' we are to bear Afflictions in Obedience to our great Creator's Will, yet we are to bear them as human Nature will permit. With Pain and Grief, and Re|luctancy; with Sighs and Groans, and Complaints; with vehement and importunate De&s;ires and Prayers to God and Man, to help and deliver us&mdash; God indulges us in this too&mdash;Our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer who is the be&s;t Pattern for our Imitation in our Behaviour, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e&mdash;<HI>Father, if it be po&s;&s;ible, let this Cup pa&s;s from me</HI>; but when he con&s;idered the Hand that held it out, he adds with Submi&s;&s;ion, <HI>Neverthele&s;s not as I will, but as thou wilt</HI>&mdash;We &s;hould con&s;ider God as wi&s;e and good in all his Di&s;pen&s;ations, not as &s;o|vereign and arbitrary, but tender and compa&s;&s;ionate to all his Creatures, who <HI>does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men</HI>; but corrects us for our profit, that we may be Partakers of his Holine&s;s: Being thus re&s;olved to acquie&s;ce in God's good Plea&s;ure.</P>

<P>Let us take due Notice of every In&s;tance of his Fa|vour, with Regard to the War; and let us all Pray, that the God of Peace, would in his own Time, conduct us to an honourable permanent Peace. That he would ha&s;ten the happy and glorious Time, when Wars and Fightings &s;hall cea&s;e among Mankind; when all Nations &s;hall be united under Je&s;us, the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, and great Head of the Church.</P>
<P>And finally, may we all be bro't at la&s;t, to the eternal World, and there join with the general A&s;&s;embly of the Church of the Fir&s;t-born, in &s;inging the Song of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the Servant of God; and the Song of the Lamb, &s;aying, in one comprehen&s;ive Strain; <HI>Great and marvellous are all thy Works of Creation, Providence and Grace, Lord God Almighty, ju&s;t and true are thy Ways, thou King of Saints.</HI></P>
