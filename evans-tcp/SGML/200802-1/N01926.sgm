<P><HI>Repre&s;entative.</HI> March 14. 1720, 21.</P>
<P>SIR, I hear that our General Court is to &s;it the next Wedne&s;day, and am very much concern'd about what the Re&s;ult of this Se&s;&s;ions will be. For the whole Province &s;eems to be di|vided into two Parties; one of them is continually exclaiming with a grievous and bitter Cry, <HI>Our Paper Money! Our Paper money</HI>! it is this that has brought upon us the direful Retinue of fatal Evils that we are &s;tooping under, and a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of it, (if emitted) will not fail to draw a &s;able Curtain over the la&s;t Appearance of our Happine&s;s, and &s;hut up every Glade of light and Pro&s;perity, to this already mi&s;erable Province. The other is al&s;o in|ce&s;&s;antly mourning, with a Cry no le&s;s audible and bitter, <HI>Our want of a Medium of Trade, it is this that will ruin us</HI>; The Silver and Gold is irrecove|rably gone; and Bills of Credit are grievou&s;ly &s;canty; and unle&s;s our Government will &s;upply us with more of the&s;e, the Want of them will open to us the darke&s;t Scene, that ever this Province &s;aw; will cut off from us every thing that may &s;eem pro&s;pe|rous, and without fail fini&s;h our de&s;truction, by bringing us under a &s;eries of inextricable &s;traits and Adver&s;ities.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002283_0003_0FDAE3E576D8D520">So that I think the great Que&s;tion every where is. <HI>Who will &s;hew us Tokens for Good?

<P>And for the Redre&s;s of our thus &s;trait and mi&s;erable Circum&s;tances, many Projections have been rai&s;ed, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d by the Pre&s;s diffu&s;ed abroad, but hitherto &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emingly inneffectual, for the gaining their de&s;ired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">int.</P>
<P>Now Sir, pray let me have your Thoughts con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ining the&s;e things.</P>
<P><HI>Gentleman.</HI> I think this Province at pre&s;ent is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">clared, by the univer&s;al con&s;ent of the Inhabi|tants, <HI>to be grievou&s;ly involved in Debt</HI>; and which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;till wor&s;e, <HI>under Impo&s;&s;ibilities of getting ont, unle&s;s &s;ome steps are taken, which the Province are not yet come into.</HI> This Cry is too common and loud, to be unheard by any Per&s;on in the whole Province. It is breathed out with &s;uch Spirits and Affection, that the very Streets and ecchoing places, &s;eem to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ound the moan of it. And hence every one, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as a true concern for his own, and dear Country's Happine&s;s, will be de&s;irous to know, what mea&s;ures may be taken, to redre&s;s tho&s;e grievances, which are &s;ounding, with &s;uch a <HI>Pathos</HI> in our ears. Many things have indeed been projected by ingenious Hands, and &s;pread abroad by the Pre&s;s, and I think they all Centre here, <HI>That the Weal or Wo of the Province, depends upon our Emitting, or not Emitting a fur|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her Supply of Bills of Credit for a Medium of Trade.</HI> But will it not be more likely to obtain the de&s;ired Effect, to enter into the foundation and &s;ource of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ttendant Evils, pre&s;cribing &s;omething to remove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir Cau&s;e, than to Conver&s;e meerly with their Superficies, with what only accidentally cau&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem, and project means which will reach no further <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">han that relief?

<P><HI>R.</HI> Your Sentiments here &s;eem to be &s;omething different, from what has been publi&s;hed by others, concerning the&s;e affairs, I know that through the Country our <HI>Paper money</HI> is generally look'd upon by People as the faulty Cau&s;e of all our &s;traits; For this, &s;ay they has enabled our Merchants to expe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t our Silver Money and encouraged them to bring in greater Quantities of European, and Ea&s;t &amp; We&s;t-India Goods, than the Produce of our Country can po&s;&s;i|bly make returns for; and then that their Goods Im|ported might not ly dormant, they have encouraged people to take them up, giving large prizes for the produce of our Country, if they may pay in Goods, (and in the mean time, they have rai&s;ed upon your Goods more than in proportion too) al&s;o giving long time of payment, for the Plenty of Bills would enable them to continue Trading at a great Rate, tho' they tru&s;t out in large quantities; whereby the ho+ne&s;t Country People have been induc'd to do, ju&s;tl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it is to be feared the Merchants have done before them, <HI>take up more than they can po&s;&s;ibly pay for.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gent.</HI> Tho' I agree with the Sentiments of People in this, that our <HI>paper money</HI> has enabled and given occa&s;ion to the Merchants to do as you have bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;aying, and therefore conclude that it is the In&s;tru|ment that has brought in our evils, yet I cannot fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> into their Scheme of Thoughts, who attribute the whole Cau&s;ality of them to it; but think it mo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> proper and ju&s;t to di&s;tingui&s;h between the real <HI>efficien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cau&s;e</HI> of them, and that which is only <HI>accidentally &s;o.</HI> Here then for the true Cau&s;e of our &s;traits, I onc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> more &s;et down, <HI>The extravagant con&s;umption o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> imported Commodities.</HI></P>

And ordinary Trade&s;men's Wives (tho' the whole Family depends upon the daily Labour of the Husband for Sub&s;i&s;tence) &s;hall be dre&s;&s;ed in Silks and Sattens and that not only on high holy-days, but in their or|dinary Vi&s;itings.

<P>The&s;e things I mention as the cau&s;e of our pre&s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Straits, they are briefly.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We will be fine, ample and &s;umptuous in all our Appearances</HI>; and</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We will not employ our &s;elves in making our own Finery; but far fetch'd, and dear bought mu&s;t be the articles of our Adorning.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, might not I have noted for the Rea&s;on there|of, <HI>Pride and abundance of Idlene&s;s.</HI> The&s;e &s;ins of <HI>Sodom,</HI> which have &s;o far prevailed in this Province, in our great Towns e&s;pecially? The Fa&s;hion that Tyranne&s;s of Fools has gained the A&s;cendant among us, and drags the Age along in the&s;e unnaccountable <HI>dear</HI> Follys.</P>
<P>Now Sir, if it were a thing po&s;&s;ible by any means to open Peoples Eyes, and give them a clear view of the&s;e things in their native Colours, I &s;hould think that would be mo&s;t &s;erviceable to the Publick.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002283_0007_0FDAE3EAC4CDACE0"><HI>Rep.</HI> I believe your Thoughts concerning our Ex|travagancys are very ju&s;t; And I al&s;o think, that nothing but pure nece&s;&s;ity will ever retrench them; and however Serviceable a plain detection of them might be, yet I rather think that the greate&s;t Service that can be done the Province at this Juncture, is fairly, coolly, and plainly to di&s;cu&s;s tho&s;e great que&s;t|ions, <HI>What method &s;hall we take at pre&s;ent to help us out of our amazing straits and difficulties? Will it be for the Advantage of this Province, to make more Pa|per money or not?</HI> que&s;tions truly weighty and moving!</P>
<P>You have &s;een the wonders, the almo&s;t Miracles which our <HI>paper Bills</HI> have already wrought, &amp; will yet naturally bring forth, if we (the Legi&s;lators) will but give them a being by our powerful <HI>Fiat</HI>; as the&s;e things have been lately &s;et before your Eyes by <HI>Amicus Patriae.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Gent.</HI> As to the innate Power of working Miracles, a&s;cribed to our <HI>Paper Bills</HI> by <HI>Amicus Patriae,</HI> I think it the Product of a too exorbitant Fancy. That Book <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eems to be intirely in a Party, for the cry of it is, <HI>We mu&s;t have plenty of Paper Bills</HI>; and I find no manner of Care taken in it either to &s;upport their Credit any farther than Fancy will do it. <HI>Make the be&s;t of them.</HI> pag. 27. <HI>Think them good.</HI> pag. 44. Or to project a &s;urer Foundation to emit them on, &s;o that tho&s;e who take them out may not be ruined by them; When as we are taught by experience (and the con&s;piring voice of the whole Province is in it) <HI>That to put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut more upon the &s;ame foot that the former Banks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere will not fail to en&s;lave us.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Que&s;tion you offer to be debated by me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t is indeed of the la&s;t Importance to us now, I mean <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s to our Secular well being; And it is &s;o nice a Point, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat it is next to impo&s;&s;ible for any one to handle it without being thought to be in a Party, which every generous Soul abhors. However, my own Circum|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tances you know are &s;uch as will be neither greatly
<PB N="8" REF="002283_0008_0FDAE3F901E31FB0">
hurt or advanced by the emitting or witholding more Bills, any further than a publick Good or evil affects private Per&s;ons, and this will help you to believe that what is here attempted by me has no private View at all.</P>
<P>And now in debating the Que&s;tion propo&s;ed, that I may &s;hew you my mind <HI>in Plain,</HI> I will lead you by per&s;picuous and ea&s;y &s;teps, as well as may be proporti|oned to gain my Point.</P>
<P>Here then I premi&s;e, that as one Member of the Body cannot, &s;o neither can one Per&s;on, Family, State or Country, &s;ay to another, <HI>I have no need of thee</HI>; But Trade, or the Exchange of one Commodity for another (which cannot be carried on without &s;ome &s;uitable Medium of Exchange) is needful to the well being of every People. The&s;e things, I &s;uppo&s;e will be granted by a general Suffrage.</P>
<P>And now I &s;uppo&s;e</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Produce of a Country, or its moveables, &s;uch as may be &s;pared for Exportation, (and not it's Lands or real E&s;tate) are to procure and &s;upply the Country with this medium of Exchange.</HI></P>
<P>The Foundation of Trade is laid in this, That one Country &s;eldom or never produces every individual) commodity (or a &s;ufficiency thereof) which is need|ful, or at lea&s;t, convenient for it's &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and or|dinarily (&s;uch is the goodne&s;s of Providence) what is wanting in one Country is abundant in ano|ther.</P>
<P>And the very notion of a medium of Exchange is, that it be &s;omething of a certain and known value, and ea&s;y of Tran&s;portation, &s;uitable to be given to make up the Ballance, where one Species to be exchanged exceeds the other; or to be given as a full price for the Commodity we want. Now if our Medium be Gold, Silver, Copper, &amp;c. it carries the foundation of its own Credit in it &s;elf; ina&s;much as the Con|&s;ent of all people is, that it is intrin&s;ically valuable But if it be <HI>Bank-Notes</HI> &amp;c. then it has no value in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+&s;elf
<PB N="9" REF="002283_0009_0FDAE3EC388B3C28">
but the Foundation of its Credit, is the Bank it is rai&s;ed upon; and every one who receives it doth &s;o, not for its own &s;ake, but for the &s;ake of the <HI>Fund.</HI> And if the <HI>Fund</HI> or <HI>Bank</HI> be Moveables, &s;uch as Gold, Silver, &amp;c. then this kind of Medium is the mo&s;t valuable, as being not of a wa&s;tful nature, and mo&s;t &s;afe and ea&s;y of Carriage; and then if all the <HI>Notes</HI> of a Country be gone, and they cannot redeem them, the wor&s;t that can be is, he that has them mu&s;t take the Fund they were rai&s;ed upon, and the Country begin anew. But if the Lands, the real E&s;tates of a Country, be the Fund to &s;upport the Credit of its <HI>Notes</HI> (as is the Ca&s;e of this Province re&s;pecting our paper Money) it is then a mo&s;t dangerous Medium. For if their <HI>Notes</HI> be gone, and they cannot redeem them, then the be&s;t that can be is, they who have the Notes or Bills mu&s;t take the Land to make good their Credit; and upon what Bottom will the Country &s;tand then?</P>
<P>This thought &s;eems enough to &s;trike through the Soul of every generous Freeholder.</P>
<P>And from the&s;e Con&s;iderations I conclude,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That the Plentifulne&s;s or Scarcity of the</HI> Medium of Ex|change <HI>in a Country, depends upon the Indu&s;try &amp; Prudence, or Idlene&s;s and Illhusbandry of its Inhabitants.</HI></P>
<P>If the prudence and Indu&s;try of a People, be &s;uch, that they will con&s;tantly prepare, either of the produce of, or Manufactures performed in their own Country, for Exporta|tion in &s;uch Plenty, as that the value of them may be more than &s;ufficient, to purcha&s;e every thing that they want from abroad, to con&s;ume among them&s;elves; then the Overplus of their value, will be con&s;tantly drawing that which is u&s;ed by the Traders for a Medium of Exchange, and make it plenty among them. And the contrary Qualifications in any Peo|ple, &s;c. Idlene&s;s and Illhusbandry, will always bring forth the contrary effect, &s;cil. a &s;carcity of the Medium of Exchange among them.</P>
<P>For if the Import of a Country be more than the Export, (it is as plain as that two and two will make four,) that the Medium of Exchange, mu&s;t go to make up the Ballance.</P>
<P>And here I am obliged to di&s;&s;ent from the wonderful Doctrine &s;cattered forth by <HI>Amicus Patriae,</HI> "That the Merchants hold the Helm, and are principle Steer&s;men in
<PB N="10" REF="002283_0010_0FDAE3FA773AFE08">
the common Affairs of Temporal Intere&s;t and Profit. D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dle. pag. 1. And that the advancement of a Country's Wealth &amp;c wholly depends upon Trading, as he &s;eems to urge, p. 18. where al&s;o to prove his Doctrine by an undeniable Evidence, he tells us that "Tyrus was but a naked Rock &s;pread out into the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a, yet by Merchandize became the Queen of the Seas, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Metropolis of the World, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Wonderful Mi&s;repre&s;entation! Doth he think that no body knows <HI>Tyre</HI> but him&s;elf? It is indeed a rocky I&s;land, (tho' not a naked Rock) that abounded with a &s;ort of Shel|fi&s;h who&s;e Liquor was mo&s;t &s;erviceable and excellent for the dying of purple, that very valuable Commodity for Exportation. Yea &s;o noted through the whole world, were the <HI>Tyrians</HI> for the Indu&s;trious improvement of that mo&s;t profitable Trade, that the &s;ame Latin Word [<HI>Tyrius</HI> the Adjective of <HI>Tyrus</HI> is u&s;ed to &s;ignify purple, and an Inhabi|tant of <HI>Tyre.</HI> This the little School-boy may teach us. And I remember Dr. <HI>Hylen,</HI> who&s;e Authority every one will allow to be great, de&s;cribing the City of <HI>Tyre,</HI> gives this as the rea&s;on of its Riches and Grandure. "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t excelled (&s;ays he) all other Cities of tho&s;e Times in <HI>Learning</HI> and <HI>Manufactures.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Co&s;mog.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Holland</HI> is al&s;o mentioned by him for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, pag. 19. as "naturally not affording any one Commodity of u&s;e; yet by Merchandize, &amp;c. It is &s;trange if any Man &s;hould pretend to de&s;cribe Countrys, who is not &s;o far ver&s;ed in Hi&s;tory, as to know that the World has noted <HI>Holland</HI> for its exemplary, its marvellous Indu&s;try in <HI>Manufactures,</HI> &s;o that it is known to Hi&s;torians by this Name, <HI>The Bee-hive of Europe.</HI></P>
<P>And now, whatever is pretended to the contrary by <HI>Amicus Patriae</HI> notwith&s;tanding, I lay this down as a principle,</P>
<P><HI>That the Opulency and Grandure of a Country depends upon the Indu&s;try and Prudence of its Inhabitants</HI>; This is the formal Cau&s;e of it, for even Trade and Commerce (which I allow to be the grand, the nece&s;&s;ary In&s;truments of promoting the&s;e) do depend upon it. And then I add,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That when once the Produce of a Country will not afford it a &s;ufficient Medium of Exchange, it will immediately be thrown headlong upon this dreadful Dilemma.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Either it's Trade mu&s;t be carried on by Barter; or its Lands u&s;ed to &s;upply it with a Medium of Exchange.</HI> The Dis|junction, I think, can't be deny'd; for if the Moveables of a Country will not &s;upply it with a Medium, &s;ome other way mu&s;t be found out, or Trade will utterly &s;ink: But there can be no other way &s;uppo&s;ed than either,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="11" REF="002283_0011_0FDAE3EF45EF4D68">1. <HI>To carry it on by Barter,</HI> (which I &s;uppo&s;e to be always attended with many very burthen&s;ome Circum&s;tances in every Place, and for many rea&s;ons wholly impracticable in this Province.) Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That the real E&s;tates or Lands of a Country be u&s;ed to &s;upply it with a Medium of Exchange</HI>; i. e. <HI>by being made a</HI> Fund <HI>for a Bank of Credit.</HI> Every Medium of Exchange mu&s;t carry &s;o much with it, as is &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the Receiver, that what he receives is as valuable as that which he parts with, and if the <HI>Medium</HI> be a Bill of Credit, there mu&s;t be &s;ome <HI>Foundation</HI> of it's Credit, to &s;atisfy him that he &s;hall certainly have, as the appointed time, that which is thereby engaged. And hence,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>When a Country overtrades it &s;elf, its Medium of Ex|change belongs to its Creditors abroad; and therefore it is a mo&s;t dangerous thing to improve the Lands of any Country to &s;upply it with a Medium of Exchange. It is a means never to be u&s;ed but in the la&s;t Extremity.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;eems very clear, that when a Country who&s;e Medium is Bills of Credit, rai&s;ed on their Lands, (as our Province Bills are) has overtraded it&s;elf; &s;o that the Bills are got in|to the Creditors Hands, and cannot be redeemed, then the Lands, which are a Fund to &s;upport their Credit, doth of Right belong, and mu&s;t be delivered to tho&s;e that do po&s;&s;e&s;s the Bills: and when this happens, then the way is fair and plain for the Lands to be reduced into <HI>Lord&s;hips</HI>; an Effect very much de&s;ired and &s;ought after by many People.</P>
<P>And now, who wont be brought into my Conclu&s;&s;on, and &s;ay, <HI>That it is indeeed a mo&s;t dangerous thing to improve the Lands of a Country to &s;upply it with a Medium of Ex|change? A Means never to be u&s;ed but in the la&s;t Extremity.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ays <HI>Amicus Patriae,</HI> pag. 18. <Q>It is whim&s;ical to talk of Merchants overtrading, among the <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> and skilful; there can be no &s;uch thing.</Q></P>
<P>What doth he think, when a Country has imported more Goods than it can po&s;&s;ibly make Returns for, &s;o that its Lands are forced to become bound over to the Creditors for Security? Hath not &s;uch a Country overtraded it&s;elf? Or doth the World mi&s;take about <HI>Terms?</HI> And has he never heard of &s;uch an In&s;tance as this? Are there no <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> skil|ful Merchants in the Province that have done &s;o?</P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> But why cannot we in this <HI>Provinoe,</HI> notwith&s;tanding our low Ebb, emit Bills on &s;uch a Foundation as that they may be equal with Money, as <HI>Amicus Patriae</HI> tells us the Bills are at <HI>Venice, Holland,</HI> and <HI>New York,</HI> in all which Places the <HI>Bank Bills</HI> are kept in Credit, as he &s;ays, pag. 50, 51, only by their being prudently managed by the Merchants; and then all the bu&s;ine&s;s in our Province, which is now almo&s;t dead, might be carryed on in a very lively manner.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="002283_0012_0FDAE3FD80D91250"><HI>Gent.</HI> It is a piece of grand Folly or Sophi&s;try, to com|pare our Bills of Credit to tho&s;e of <HI>Venice, Holland,</HI> or any other place, where they have a Bank of Gold, Silver, &amp;c. to &s;upport the Credit of them, when we have nothing but our real E&s;tates to give Credit and Currency to ours.</P>
<P>As to the Bills of <HI>Venice, Amicus Patriae</HI> hi&s;elf tells us pag. 42. <Q>That when the Bank was erected, there was the &s;ame Quantity of Money brought into the Trea&s;ury, as there were Bills given out, &s;c. <HI>Six Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds.</HI></Q> And hence the <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> Author &s;hows much of his <HI>tran&s;cendent Logick,</HI> in bringing this to parallel the Ca&s;e of our Province, where we can ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k of nothing but making our Lands a Fund to &s;upport the Credit of our Bills.</P>
<P>There are the&s;e things con&s;iderable about the Bank of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There was a Fund of Money brought and lodged in the Trea&s;ury equal to the Notes emitted; and therefore every one that had, a Note, might when he plea&s;ed have brought it into the Trea&s;ury, and taken out Silver and Gold Money for it.</HI> This might well give them a good Credit and Currency. And if we grant that in proce&s;s of Time, when the Credit of the Bills was very high, the Bankers took all the Money out of the Trea&s;ury, and made u&s;e of it at plea&s;ure, as <HI>Ami|cus Patriae</HI> &s;ugge&s;ts, (tho' I have only his bare Word to de|pend on for the truth of this; however, &s;uppo&s;e it &s;o,) yet they are &s;till obliged as firmly as ever, to change any Note than &s;hall be brought, and every one knows, that they are not on|ly bound to do &s;o, but that they can do it with the greate&s;t Ea&s;e, if it be required of them; becau&s;e,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The current Medium of Exchange in Venice is Silver Mo|ney, which may be procured at any time to exchange for Bank Bills.</HI> (This I have atte&s;ted by an Eye-Witne&s;s of the Fact.) And hence no body de&s;ires to have them chang'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e are Con&s;iderations truly valuable, &s;ufficient to build and maintain the Credit of any Bank what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Again as to the Bank of <HI>Holland,</HI> every one that is acquain|ted with the Circum&s;tances of it, knows, that there are al|ways ma&s;ty Heaps of <HI>Silver and Gold</HI> in the Trea&s;ury, rea|dy to exchange every Bank Note that &s;hall be brought to them at any time. And now, are the&s;e two In&s;tances fairly ap|plicable to us?</P>
<P>And for the Bank of <HI>New York,</HI> I have no particular Know|ledge of it, but believe what I commonly hear, that all Gen|tlemen who know their Affairs will te&s;tify, that their Bills are not one Jot better than ours were when of the &s;ame Age; and if they continue as long as ours have done, by their Ap|pearance, will be no better than ours now are.</P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> However dangerous you &s;how it to be, <HI>for a Country to make u&s;e of its Lands to &s;upply it&s;elf with a Medium of
<PB N="13" REF="002283_0013_0FDAE3F0B6CF9208">
Exchange,</HI> yet I perceive you allow that it may be done in a Ca&s;e of Extremity. I think the Ca&s;e of this Province is ex|tream difficult, va&s;t N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbers have their Lands under Mort|gages for Money taken out of the la&s;t Banks, who cannot get Money to redeem them. The Cry of People in the Country is, How &s;hall we pay our Rates if there be no Mo|ney? And the Merchants con&s;tantly importune us for a fuller Supply of a <HI>Medium of Trade.</HI> We have not a &s;uffici|ency of <HI>Moveables</HI> &s;uitable to put in as a Fund, on which to erect a Bank of Credit; for our Silver Money is gone, and if I may believe Reports &s;eemingly well a&s;certain'd, our <HI>Plate</HI> is going after, on the &s;ame melancholly Errand; and all in&s;ufficient too.</P>
<P><HI>Gent.</HI> It &s;eems very rea&s;onable that a Country in Extremity &s;hould make u&s;e of its Credit to &s;upport it&s;elf, <HI>i. e.</HI> by ma|king its Lands a Fund, on which to emit Bills of Credit. But in &s;uch Ca&s;es I think it &s;tands them in hand to be very careful,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Not to emit too many of them</HI>; for this will &s;uddenly depre&s;s their Credit. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Punctually to call them in at the time appointed,</HI> other|wi&s;e the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or will think him&s;elf wrong'd; for I know no Difference between the&s;e <HI>Bills,</HI> and a <HI>Bill</HI> or <HI>Bond</HI> given by a private Per&s;on. And it &s;eems as if the po&s;tponing of half our Province Tax had a great Hand in cru&s;hing the Credit of our Bills.</P>
<P><HI>Rep.</HI> Sir, I think almo&s;t every one is ready to reflect upon <HI>Amicus Patriae,</HI> for making a great <HI>Bu&s;tle of Words</HI> and bringing forth no Projections for our &s;afely emitting more Money, retorting his own proverb, <Q>Parturiunt Montes, na&s;citur ridiculus Mus.</Q></P>
<P>Now let me know, which way you think we may mo&s;t &s;afe|ly emit a Quantity of Bills of Credit, for unle&s;s you do this, you do ju&s;t nothing, for I think there will certainly be &s;ome made this Se&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Gent.</HI> Sir, I will freely give you my mind here, as I have already done in the Premi&s;es.</P>
<P>But I will fir&s;t enter a Caveat, <HI>If you emit more Paper Money, you mu&s;t very carefully provide for the &s;upport of its Credit.</HI> I know <HI>Amicus Patriae</HI> will laugh at this, and tell us that their Credit may be kept up by the <HI>power of a</HI> Wi&s;e <HI>Imagination,</HI> pag 44. (Ju&s;t like the Popi&s;h Doctrine of <HI>Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation; Crede quod edes, et edes,</HI> &s;ay they.) And we may with the &s;ame rea&s;on &s;ay of any other of our Af|fairs, <HI>Believe that they are well, and they are and &s;hall be &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>And let <HI>Amicus Patriae</HI> &s;ay what he plea&s;e about the Mer|chants &s;upporting the Credit of our Bills, by willingly recei|ving and highly commending them; it is a Truth too plain to be palliated, by Fancy, That the Merchants always rai&s;e upon
<PB N="14" REF="002283_0014_0FDAE3FEFAAEFEB8">
their Goods more in proportion, than other Commodities are rai&s;ed by the plenty or meane&s;s of Money. I am credibly eno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> informed, that at the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he General Court, when the Bill had pa&s;&s;ed in the Lower Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e for emitting a Sum of Paper Money, the Merchants immediately rai&s;ed 25 <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon their Goods, and the Shopkeepers had begun, on the &s;ame foundation to bid high for them. Now for the obtaining this end, the &s;upporting of their Credit, I propo&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That you put out but little at a time.</HI> Don't let us have a Glut of it, for that will plainly depretiate it. The contin|gent Charge of this Provi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e is about 10 or 12 Thou&s;and <HI>l.</HI> a Year, which mu&s;t be made Yearly; and this Year it is about 15 or 16 Thou&s;and, to which If you add about 15 or 16 Thou|&s;and more, it &s;eems to me, that will be enough for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That you be con&s;tant and &s;teady in putting out a &s;uitable Quantity.</HI> The making much one Year and little or none ano|ther, hath and always will hurt the Credit of our Bills, by to&s;&s;ing the Prizes of every thing, &s;o that no one can make a Judgment where to fix, to the great Damage of this Province in all its Affairs. And,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That you be punctual to call in the Bills at the time ap|pointed.</HI> I can &s;ee no difference as I &s;aid before, between our Pr. Bills, &amp; the Bills or Bonds of private Men; &amp; if there be none, we may fairly argue, that they ought to be an&s;wer'd, <HI>i.e.</HI> called in punctually at the time appointed. Having thus fini&s;hed my Caution, I come now to an&s;wer your Reque&s;t, by &s;aying &s;ome|thing of the <HI>Method</HI> wherein Bills of Credit may be emitted for the greate&s;t Safety and Service of our Province at this Juncture. And here my thoughts are,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Not by</HI> any <HI>private Bank</HI>: Unle&s;s the <HI>Bankers</HI> could bring in Silver or Gold Money for a Fund to &s;upport the Credit of their Bills (as I believe all private <HI>Bankers</HI> in the World do.) I fear that that Circum&s;tance which brings this Province into a <HI>private Bank,</HI> will hedge up our Way with Thorns; for you know, that the Publick is much more merciful to its Members, being Debtors, than private Men are, or can be thought to be to tho&s;e who are indebted to them: And how grievous is the Cry of Oppre&s;&s;ion among our people, who have mortgaged their Lands to the publick Banks? Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Not as the two former Banks were emitted.</HI> It is a general Cry that the&s;e Mea&s;ures do and will too much intangle the prudent, and lay too great a Temptation before tho&s;e that want Guardians. And further,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Not to be paid in</HI> Lumber, <HI>&amp;c. to the publick.</HI> This would create &s;uch a numerous &s;et of Officers, as that the Stock mu&s;t go in a great Mea&s;ure to pay Charges. Once more,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Not as was projected in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives at their la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions,</HI> &s;c. That he who took 100 <HI>l.</HI> &s;hould pay 10 <HI>l.</HI>
