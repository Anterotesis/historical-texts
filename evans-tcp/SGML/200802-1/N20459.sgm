<HEAD>AN IMPARTIAL REVIEW, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE circum&s;tances on which Dr. Ru&s;h founds his opini|on, that the Contagious Yellow Fever which prevailed in Philadelphia from the beginning of Augu&s;t to November, in the year 1793, he tells us, are the&s;e, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> "A quantity of damaged coffee was expo&s;ed on the 24th of July, in a &s;ituation, on a wharf and in a dock, which favoured its putrefaction and exhalation, in con&s;equence of which its &s;mell was highly putrid and offen&s;ive to the inhabi|tants who re&s;ided in the neighbourhood of that wharf." And</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> "The Yellow Fever in the We&s;t Indies, and in all other counties where it is endemic, is the offspring of vegeta|ble putrefaction. And as the &s;ame cau&s;es under like circum|&s;tances mu&s;t always produce the &s;ame effects, &s;imilar degrees of heat acting upon dead and moi&s;t vegetable matters are capable of producing it, together with all its various modifications, in every part of the world."</P>
<P>In &s;upport of this opinion he has employed &s;ome authorities, and a multitude of very ingenious and highly laboured argu|ments.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of entering into a formal refutation of the&s;e, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with oppo&s;ing a few authorities to tho&s;e which he has quoted re&s;pecting the opinion of the Yellow Fever being the offspring of vegetable putrefaction, and in&s;tead of replying methodically to all his arguments, &s;hall &s;hew "how a plain tale will &s;et him down."</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations of the generality of the We&s;t India writers have been &s;o imperfect and inaccurate, that they did not even &s;u&s;pect the di&s;ea&s;e of being contagious, and in&s;tead of a&s;cribing it to the exhalations from putrid vegetable &s;ub&s;tances they &s;ay,
<PB N="4" REF="026836_0003_0FD190D2F7B17240">
it is occa&s;ioned by &s;ome irregularity in &s;ome of the non natu|rals in conjunction with the heat of the climate.&mdash;Even Lind, who is quoted by Dr. Ru&s;h in &s;upport of his opinion, makes no mention of its being derived from vegetable putrefaction; all he &s;ays is, that "in general it proceeds from inten&s;e heat and a peculiar unhealthfulne&s;s of the air: But what gives ri&s;e to that unhealthfulne&s;s of the air, he has not &s;aid <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;ea&s;es of hot climates, 5th Edition, page 119.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It cannot be inferred that the Fever is the offspring of vege|table putrefaction from what is &s;aid by Dr. Lind at page 179, re&s;pecting the greater mortality of patients with the Yellow Fever at Greenwich Ho&s;pital in Jamaica, which was &s;ituated in a low, damp, unwhole&s;ome place, but only implies that un|whole&s;ome air aggravated the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e, which we know to be the ca&s;e in all other fevers.</P>
<P>The &s;upport, Dr Ru&s;h &s;uppo&s;ed his opinion had received from Dr. Miller's account of the <HI>bilious colic</HI> which prevailed at Dover from vegetable putrefaction, mu&s;t fall to the ground, when the reader is a&s;&s;ured, that the ca&s;es of colic which were &s;uppo&s;ed to have ari&s;en from that cau&s;e, have &s;ince been proved by Dr. Sykes to have ari&s;en from the u&s;e of bark adulterated with litharge, as I can make appear from a letter now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion from Dr. Sykes, dated at Dover the 29th of May la&s;t.</P>
<P>That Dr. Lind, as well as Sir John Pringle, &s;hould have mi&s;taken the nature and cau&s;es of this fever, is by no means &s;urpri&s;ing; &s;ince neither of them ever had an opportunity of &s;eeing a ca&s;e of it, and as they did not know or even &s;u&s;pect the di&s;ea&s;e to be contagious, and believed that every other kind of contagious fever was derived from dead and putrid animal mat|ter, and had very vague and imperfect ideas of the nature of contagion and its cau&s;es, their authority on the pre&s;ent que&s;tion ought not to be admitted.</P>
<P>Even Dr. Cullen, forming his opinion upon the report of others, has mi&s;taken the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, and cla&s;&s;ed it im|properly, among&s;t putrid di&s;ea&s;es; whereas not only the &s;ymp|toms, but every di&s;&s;ection which has been made, demon&s;trate the di&s;ea&s;e to be &s;pecifically different from both the bilious, and the putrid fever<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. David&s;on &s;ays that when there was a vomitting of bile, the patient recovered.</NOTE>. In&s;tead of a redundancy of bile excreted at the beginning, which is one of the pathognomonic &s;igns of a bilious fever, there was a deficiency of that fluid, as is well
<PB N="5" REF="026836_0004_0FD1E1D4B1C885A8">
known to every practitioner in this city, and that the principal affection was an inflammation of the &s;tomach and parts adja|cent, requiring a treatment &s;imilar to other inflammatory local affections, connected with idiopathic fever, not only the &s;ucce&s;s of the treatment but every di&s;&s;ection &s;ufficiently proves. If the di&s;ea&s;e was neither a bilious nor a putrid fever, but a &s;ynochus or an inflammatory fever at the beginning, and putrid before its termination, when it proved mortal, in&s;tead of a&s;cribing it to the exhalations from putrid vegetables, common &s;en&s;e would dictate, as well as analogy direct us to a&s;cribe it to &s;pe|cific contagion, as Dr. Mitchel did when it occurred in Virgi|nia.</P>
<P>The effects of putrefaction upon coffee as well as upon mo&s;t other vegetables, is the extrication of a quantity of fixed, and inflammable air, be&s;ides earth, coal, alkaline &s;alt and water.&mdash; And it is well known, that none of the&s;e are capable of pro|ducing a contagious di&s;ea&s;e, though by inducing weakne&s;s they may di&s;po&s;e the body to be more ea&s;ily affected by contagion or other cau&s;es of fever.</P>
<P>Dr. Blane who had frequent opportunities of &s;eeing the Yellow Fever at Jamaica, in the year 1781 and 82, remarks that, "with regard to the cau&s;e of this fever, it differs from the Bilious Remittent in this, that the <HI>air</HI> of <HI>woods</HI> and <HI>mar&s;hes</HI> is not nece&s;&s;ary to produce it, for it was mo&s;t commonly brought on by intemperance or by too much exerci&s;e in the heat of the &s;un. It was ob&s;ervable however that it was more apt to ari&s;e when, be&s;ides the&s;e cau&s;es, men were expo&s;ed to un|whole&s;ome land air, or to the foul air of &s;hips, either from <HI>in|fectious effluvia</HI> or from the putrefaction that takes place in <HI>ne|glected holds.</HI>"&mdash;It is al&s;o remarkable, adds Dr. Blane, that this fever is confined almo&s;t entirely to new comers from a cold or a temperate climate.</P>
<P>Dr. Mo&s;ely who publi&s;hed his ob&s;ervations on tropical di&s;ea|&s;es &s;ince Dr. Blane, and who practi&s;ed 12 years in Jamaica, &s;ays the <HI>Yellow Fever</HI> is totally different from the Remitting Bilious Fever; for all habits, natives as well as foreigners are &s;ubject to the latter, particularly after the periodical rains and in the fall of the year; whereas the Yellow Fever, is confined almo&s;t entirely to foreigners or new comers." But as he was ignorant of its contagious nature he has a&s;cribed it to the &s;en&s;ible quali|ties of the atmo&s;phere operating on plethoric habits not acco|modated to the climate. Hence he has named it the endemial Cau&s;us, or inflammatory fever of hot climates, Dr. Jack&s;on al&s;o who re&s;ided &s;ome time in Jamaica, and has lately publi&s;hed an
<PB N="6" REF="026836_0005_0FD1E1D5EBE077B8">
excellent treati&s;e on fevers, &s;ays "the Yellow Fever &s;eldom at|tacks any but new comers in that i&s;land, whereas the remitting fever attacks per&s;ons of all de&s;criptions, whether natives or foreigners, a fact which irrefragably proves that there actually exi&s;ts &s;ome e&s;&s;ential difference between the two di&s;ea&s;es."</P>
<P>To the&s;e I might add the opinions of many more all tending to prove that the Yellow Fever is no way connected with the genus of Bilious Fever.</P>
<P>Dr. Mitchel in his letter on the Yellow Fever which appear|ed in Virginia in 1741, con&s;idered the di&s;ea&s;e as ari&s;ing from &s;pecific contagion, and &s;ays it was imported twice into that &s;tate by &s;hips of war from the We&s;t Indies".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mitchell's letter to Dr. Franklin, p. 22.</NOTE></P>
<P>That Bilious Remittents are not contagious, is not "a new doctrine held and propagated in no part of the world but in this city," as Dr. Ru&s;h a&s;&s;erts, is evident from the writings of Prin|gle, Van&s;wieten, Monro, Lind, and Cullen, and many other au|thors of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable character. Some of the authors quoted by Dr. Ru&s;h, in &s;upport of the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the que&s;tion, were not qualified to di&s;cern the connection between cau&s;e and effect, and others have publi&s;hed &s;uch incongruous, and ab&s;urd things that it would be a wa&s;te of time to attempt a formal refutation of their opinions.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore only ob&s;erve, that if tho&s;e authors were not deceived, why have we not more frequent in&s;tances of the contagious nature of &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es, and why do not Phy&s;icians di&s;cover &s;uch ca&s;es in this country as well as in others. The efficient cau&s;e of an effect mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily always produce the &s;ame effect under &s;imilar circum&s;tances; the &s;ame Circum&s;tan|ces often occur here in which the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are &s;aid to have been contagious in other countries, but no &s;uch effect is ob&s;er|ved to follow; The Bilious Fever, therefore, is not conta|gious.</P>
<P>Again, If the Bilious Fever were contagious it &s;hould pro|pagate a fever of the &s;ame kind, which would always be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the &s;ame leading or characteri&s;tic &s;ymptoms, but this is never the ca&s;e, therefore the Bilious Fever is not con|tagious. But the Yellow Fever is contagious of con&s;equence it is not a higher <HI>gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> of the Bilious Remitting Fever, and the title which Dr. Ru&s;h has given it is wrong. Surely if Dr. Lind had thought the Bilious Fever was contagious, he would not have &s;aid the Yellow Fever in Jamaica was not con|tagious, and have quoted Dr Nay&s;mith in &s;upport of that opi|nion,
<PB N="7" REF="026836_0006_0FD1E1D768EFF718">
when he entertained an opinion that it was only a higher degree of the Bilious Fever of hot climates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lind on infection p. 212.</NOTE>; It is true if he was mi&s;taken in the one circum&s;tance, he might have been de|ceived in the other; but it can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed, that all the other authors that I have mentioned, would have been totally &s;ilent if they had ever met with ca&s;es of &s;uch fevers, propagated by contagion.</P>
<P>Dr. Gardner, who is an advocate for the contagious power of Intermittent and Remittent fevers, acknowledges that "they mu&s;t be changed in their nature before they can become con|tagious, in con&s;equence of the impure air of crowded wards or other unfavourable &s;ituations." Dr. Black al&s;o, on the human &s;pecies, &s;ays "the&s;e fevers not only differ from continued fevers in their not being contagious, but al&s;o in their exacerbations occurring only once in 24 hours, whereas tho&s;e of the continued genus have two exacerbations in the cour&s;e of every 24 hours." A &s;imilar ob&s;ervation is made by Dr. Cullen in his <HI>fir&s;t lines.</HI> This is certainly giving up the point; for a di&s;ea&s;e changed in its nature is no longer the &s;ame, and when fevers occcur with characters different from tho&s;e from whence they are &s;uppo&s;ed to originate in particular &s;ituations, it only implies that a contagion has been generated in con&s;equence of &s;uch &s;ituation, different from the original di&s;ea&s;e; this takes place where num|bers are crowded together, and fre&s;h air is excluded, though every per&s;on was perfectly healthy before they were &s;o crowded and deprived of fre&s;h air<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Exhalations which are con&s;tantly though in&s;en&s;ibly i&s;&s;uing from the human body in a &s;tate of health, or when affected with a di&s;|ea&s;e not contagious, is generally con&s;idered to be harmle&s;s, and there|fore has had little attention paid to it; but if it be long confined for want of free ventilation, or retained in apparel or bed clothes of the per&s;on, it will be accumulated and acted upon in &s;uch a manner as to produce a contagion little inferior in degree of virulence, to that which comes from the body, labouring under a nervous or putrid fever. In mo&s;t ca&s;es however, this contagious matter does not affect the per&s;on from whom it i&s;&s;ues &s;o readily as it does others, becau&s;e the body be|comes from habit in&s;en&s;ible to its action, unle&s;s after the application of unu&s;ually debilitating cau&s;es; in con&s;equence of which, a preterna|tural predi&s;po&s;ition is induced. A melancholy proof of this is record|ed in Stow's Chronicle for 1577, in con&s;equence of a pri&s;oner who was arraigned at the a&s;&s;izes held at Oxford, commonly called the black a&s;&s;izes, and at the a&s;&s;izes held at the old Bailey in the year 1750, re|lated by Sir John Pringle. At which time numbers received the con|tagion which i&s;&s;ued from the clothing of the Pri&s;oners, though they were not affected them&s;elves.</NOTE>. As this part of my &s;ubject is intended
<PB N="8" REF="026836_0007_0FD1E1D96C751E68">
for medical people, I need only appeal to medical records for the truth of what I have advanced. I &s;hall only add that the contagion &s;o generated is always of a &s;pecific nature, and occa|&s;ions a fever of a continued and not of an Intermitting or Re|mitting form.</P>
<P>According to the principles laid down by Dr. Ru&s;h, where and whenever vegetable putrefaction abounds in a hot &s;ea&s;on, the contagion of the Yellow Fever mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be gene|rated; if this were the ca&s;e it would appear every year in Madrid, which is &s;ituated almo&s;t in the middle of an exten&s;ive plain, where the climate is exceedingly &s;ultry during the &s;um|mer &s;ea&s;on, and where, according to the ob&s;ervations of Lord Kaim in his &s;ketches of the hi&s;tory of man, heaps of unmole&s;ted dirt and putrefaction, rai&s;e in every part of that populous, and crowded city the mo&s;t intolerable &s;tench, and fill the air with putrid exhalations, &s;o gro&s;s as almo&s;t to &s;uffocate a &s;tranger upon his fir&s;t arrival. The&s;e however have never yet produced the Yellow Fever. Nor is there any records of its having ever appeared at Carthagena, where we are told by Mr. Town&s;end, the weather is &s;till hotter than at Madrid, the &s;treets more filthy, and the air more replete with putrid exhalations; though "a bilious fever prevails there every autumn, in con&s;equence of its proximity to an exten&s;ive mar&s;h on its ea&s;t &s;ide called the Al|major." But the&s;e differ in no re&s;pect from remittents of other Countries, except that putrid &s;ymptoms &s;ooner come on than in colder climates with a purer air.</P>
<P>But we need not explore foreign Countries for evidence to prove that the Yellow Fever is not the product of vegetable putrefaction conjoined with great heat, but is a di&s;ea&s;e e&s;&s;enti|ally different from every other hitherto known; for we have many &s;ituations in our own Country, which abound with a greater quantity of putrid vegetables than Philadelphia, nor are evidence wanting to prove that Philadelphia has had more putrid matter in it, and in its vicinity, in former years when the &s;ummers were both dryer and hotter than the la&s;t. The year 1782, when almo&s;t every blade of gra&s;s was con&s;umed by heat and drought, and &s;ome of the mar&s;hy ground &s;et on fire by the heat of the &s;un, or by the action of the electric fluid on the inflammable air generated in &s;uch places, mu&s;t be recollected by numbers, but if it is not, may be found on record; yet there was no Yellow Fever here then, nor in any part of United Ame|rica; nor at any other time, but what has or might have been traced to importation, as I &s;hall make appear in the &s;e|quel.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="026836_0008_0FD1E1DE24C2B888">But what &s;hews in the mo&s;t forcible manner, that the di&s;ea&s;e did not depend upon &s;ituation or the influence of putrid vege|table exhalation, is the manner in which it began and &s;pread through the city, and al&s;o in New York in the year 1791, from the middle of Augu&s;t to the middle of October. Epidemics, &s;uch as bilious remittents <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Some Phy&s;icians have &s;uppo&s;ed this fever was immediately pro|duced (viz. the Yellow Fever which occurred at Nev York in the year 1791,) by an exhalation from a large quantity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which had been thrown out of the Slips on the adjoining docks, nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Peck's &s;lip, where the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appeared; however, this was nothing more than a mia&s;ma, &s;imilar to that which ari&s;es from mar&s;hes when acted upon by the heat of the &s;un, and could not produce this fever, any otherwi&s;e than by increa&s;ing predi&s;po&s;ition. I am al&s;o induced to doubt this being the exciting (or direct) cau&s;e of the fever, from the per&s;ons who were fir&s;t affected re&s;iding at &s;ome di&s;tance from the dock on which the mud was depo&s;ited; and from its not appearing in other parts of the city where the Slips were cleared out in the &s;ame manner, and depo&s;ited in like &s;ituations, until it extended gradually from the place where it fir&s;t &s;hewed it&s;elf."

But this was not the ca&s;e with the Yellow Fever, Synochus Icteroides or Ga&s;tritis Contagio&s;a, which prevailed la&s;t year in Philadelphia. On the contrary this di&s;ea&s;e began at a lodging hou&s;e, and ordinary kept by Richard Dennie in water &s;treet, where two French men from the We&s;t Indies were then at lodgings, and where the fir&s;t ca&s;e was ob&s;erved on the fir&s;t or &s;econd of Augu&s;t by Dr. Phy&s;ick; and on the 3d of the &s;ame month in the &s;ame hou&s;e, another patient with the di&s;ea&s;e was vi&s;itted by Dr. Cathrall; from whence it &s;pread gradually as people in the neighbourhood had intercour&s;e with the infected and with one another. To that neighbourhood it was con|fined for more than two weeks, before it occa&s;ioned much a alarm, or even any &s;u&s;picion of its being contagious. Dr. Ru&s;h acknowledges that he had no &s;u&s;picion of the nature or origin of the di&s;ea&s;e, before the 19th, when he was in con&s;ultation on the ca&s;e of Mrs. Lemaigre, and was informed by Dr. Hodge, that &s;everal had died very &s;uddenly in that neighbourhood, with &s;ymptoms of a very malignant fever; and was the &s;ame day told by Dr. Foulke that a quantity of damaged coffee which was intolerably offen&s;ive, had been di&s;charged on Mr Ball's Wharf."</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances, Dr. Ru&s;h, before he had an oppor|tunity of informing him&s;elf &s;ufficiently of the facts, conceived
<PB N="10" REF="026836_0009_0FD1E1E33B4E1160">
the idea that the di&s;ea&s;e was the offspring of the exhalation from the damaged coffee; in con&s;equence of which, he immediately publi&s;hed that opinion. Need I tell the reader that Dr. San|grado publi&s;hed a book, in which he advi&s;ed copious bleeding and immea&s;urable quantities of warm water for the cure of the Drop&s;y, and when he di&s;covered his mi&s;take, he ob&s;erved to Gil Blas with a &s;olemn air, "though I know I am wrong yet it is better that all Valadolid &s;hould die than for me to change my opinion." If Dr. Ru&s;h's opinion "had not been founded on the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion" the di&s;ea&s;e would have attack|ed numbers at the &s;ame time as has been already ob&s;erved, but in&s;tead of that it affected none but tho&s;e who came within a certain di&s;tance of the &s;ick or into the air of the &s;ick room, for it is well known that all who &s;hut them&s;elves up in their hou&s;es, retired into the country, and &s;hunned every &s;ub&s;tance which had been in contact with or near to tho&s;e actually infected; and that every one who ob&s;erved the&s;e precautions, though daily abroad in the open &s;treets and markets, e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e, as was al&s;o the ca&s;e with the pri&s;oners in the jail, the pen&s;ioners in the alms-hou&s;e, and the patients in the Ho&s;pital, where &s;trict attention was paid to avoid all intercour&s;e with the infected.</P>
<P>Can any man of common &s;en&s;e &s;uppo&s;e this could po&s;&s;ibly have been the ca&s;e if the di&s;ea&s;e had been occa&s;ioned by the exhalations from putrid coffee or other putrid vegetable &s;ub|&s;tances, diffu&s;ed abroad through the atmo&s;phere of the whole city, as has been &s;o po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted. Oracles may utter any thing at Delphos, and credulity will &s;wallow it.</P>
<P>Having thus proved the opinion of the gentleman to whom I am oppo&s;ed in &s;entiment, to be erroneous, I now proceed to &s;tate the evidence in favour of the opinion that the di&s;ea&s;e was imported: and though I &s;hould not be able to e&s;tabli&s;h it, by direct or po&s;itive proofs, I expect the circum&s;tantial evidence, which I &s;hall &s;ay before the reader, will be &s;ufficient to convince him beyond the power of re&s;i&s;tance, that the di&s;ea&s;e was intro|duced into Philadelphia by importation, and was not generated in it.</P>
<P>The reader need not be informed, that much difficulty ari&s;es, and many ob&s;tacles are generally oppo&s;ed to inve&s;tigations of this kind, from the parties mo&s;t immediately concerned.

from the We&s;t India i&s;lands, in &s;ome of which the Yellow Fever had prevailed with unu&s;ual mortality, ever &s;ince the year 1791, as appears from Dr. Chi&s;holm's account publi&s;hed in the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries for 1793, and from a letter now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dr. Cumming of this city from Dr. George David&s;on <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"I have ob&s;erved with unea&s;ine&s;s and concern (&s;ays Dr. David|&s;on,) that an Epidemical Fever nearly &s;imilar to that which we have had in this i&s;land for &s;ix months pa&s;t, has appeared in Philadelphia."</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>The di&s;ea&s;e as it occurred with us, attacked with more violence and proved more fatal than I ever recollect to have &s;een during a re&s;i|dence of 22 years in the We&s;t Indies; and part of that time at St Lucia, where I had an opportunity of &s;eeing the di&s;ea&s;e among&s;t the troops and &s;ailors in all its forms.</P>
<P>Our dry &s;ea&s;on, adds Dr. David&s;on, commonly commences the beginning of December and continues till May; the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on, however, the rains continued with but little intermi&s;&s;ion till the end of march, when it was &s;ucceeded by hot &s;ultry weather. The thermometer ge|nerally at 90 in the town, and the nights equally hot and &s;ultry with the day. Early in April the Yellow Fever made its appearance, both on &s;hore and on board the &s;hipping. The young, plethoric, and tho&s;e lately arrived from a cold climate were chiefly affected. The inflam|matory &s;ymptoms run high. Bloodletting, bli&s;ters, and gentle and con&s;tant purging an&s;wered at fir&s;t; but on the further progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e and the weather &s;till continuing hot, the marks of inflammatory diathe&s;is became le&s;s evident, and the pul&s;e &s;unk upon bloodletting. The vomiting did not appear upon the fir&s;t days, and &s;ooner ended in black vomiting. We found it nece&s;&s;ary to alter our practice; but I mu&s;t candidly confe&s;s that till I adopted the u&s;e of cold bathing, under the&s;e circum&s;tances which indicated a typhus type our endeavours to cure it were attended with little &s;ucce&s;s. In the inflammatory &s;tate the di&s;ea&s;e was more at command, but in the other the irritability of the &s;tomach was &s;uch that we could not u&s;e tonics. Neither bark, wine, nor opium could be retained. Upon a general review of the ill &s;ucce&s;s which attended the practice of the medical gentlemen in this i&s;land, as well as in Grenada and Tobago, I was inclined to try the effects of cold bathing, which I had u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s in the advanced &s;tage of the Remittent Fever in ca&s;es of debility, low delirium, &s;ub&s;ultus tendinum, and other marks of debility without any internal local affection occur|red. At fir&s;t I tried the effects of the bathing in the advanced &s;tate of the fever but without any &s;ucce&s;s; but as every other plan had &s;till failed I began with it in the very commencement. Warm tamarind or cream of tartar and manna beverage was given immediately after appli|cation of the cold bath, to excite &s;weat and open the body if that effect was not previou&s;ly produced by gly&s;ters; and the in&s;tant that a &s;weat appeared bark mixed with the beverage was given in as large quantities as the &s;tomach would retain, without paying any attention to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ever or &s;tate of the patients pul&s;e; when however the &s;tomach rejected the bark and there appeared to be an increa&s;e of head ach, heat, and other &s;ymptoms of febrile affection, I had again recour&s;e to the cold bath|ing <HI>alone,</HI> which was commonly repeated evening and mornings until the patient was out of danger. I am happy in announcing that this mode of treatment has been attended with the utmo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The cold bathing &s;eemed to take off the determination to the brain, to remove irritability and to determine to the &s;urface, for in every ca&s;e a plentiful &s;weat was excited.</P></Q>
<P>Dr. Chi&s;holm informs us that this di&s;ea&s;e made its appearance among the troops at St Georges, in the i&s;land of Granada, about the latter end of September, 1791, and that having found all the common means to fail, he made trial of mercury, which he repeated in conjunction with thebaic tincture, in do&s;es of five grains every four hours till it produced ptyali&s;m, and that in no in&s;tance in which it produced that effect, did it fail of effecting a cure. He found bloodletting al&s;o u&s;eful as the winter months approached, whereas when the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t ap|peared, it had a bad effect. Such was al&s;o the ca&s;e in Philadelphia.</P>
<P>(Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of attending to &s;ymptoms in&s;tead of the name or &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e.)</P>
<P>In another part of the &s;ame latter Dr. David&s;on &s;ays, he has to ob|&s;erve that "in very few in&s;tances have I met with bilious vomiting, and where it did occur the patient always recovered; that di&s;&s;ections rarely &s;hewed any affection of the liver; the gall bladder was generally tinged with bile of the natural colour, but thicker than u&s;ual, as we &s;hould expect from its long retention. The &s;tomach was frequently found without any preternatural appearances, except when the black vomiting occurred, and then it was found gangrenous. Upon &s;ome occa&s;ions the blood ve&s;&s;els of the brain were highly turgid with blood, and the ventricles with a yellowi&s;h fluid."</P></NOTE> of St. Vincents to Dr. Brown of Balti|more, dated November 12 1793, for which I am indebted to the politene&s;s of Dr. Cumming.

in &s;everal of the London New&s;papers, particularly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the information contained in the&s;e papers, I am indebted to the politene&s;s of Mr M. Carey of this city.</NOTE> in the Courier of Augu&s;t 13th and 24th 1793, in the Ob&s;erver of Au|gu&s;t 25th, and in a King&s;ton paper of October 12th 1793, the King&s;ton paper contains the following paragraph. "The i&s;lands of Barbadoes and Dominica continue to be afflicted with the Malignant Fever, (&s;ome of the other papers &s;ay the Yellow Fever) about 300 white inhabitants have peri&s;hed in the for|mer, and near 500 in the latter."</P>
<P>It was al&s;o epidemic and extremely mortal among the Eu|ropean troops at the &s;ame time at St Domingo, from whence a multitude of the inhabitants fled at different times in the &s;ummer of 1793, on account of a de&s;olating war, in con&s;e|quence of the in&s;urrections of the &s;laves in that i&s;land, and took &s;helter in Philadelphia. Several &s;ick per&s;ons as well as others were brought away.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="026836_0012_0FD1E1E9170835B0">Two ve&s;&s;els in particular from that i&s;land con&s;igned to the hou&s;e of Vanuxem and Lombart, arrived in this port after the middle of July, and came-to at their wharf, which is very near to the hou&s;e where the di&s;ea&s;e made its fir&s;t appearance. One of the&s;e named the &s;loop Amelia, William Williams Ma&s;ter, arrived in the port from Borgne, a &s;mall port of St Domingo, laden with coffee with five hands be&s;ides the Ma&s;ter, and came-to at Mr. Vanuxem's wharf on the 24th of July, where &s;he immedi|ately began to di&s;charge her cargo, part of which, from a leak &s;he had get in her pa&s;&s;age was very wet and damaged; &s;everal hundred weight were thrown into the dock which at low water is covered with water, and on the 30th, 98 bags of that which was lea&s;t damaged was &s;old on the wharf, as appears by a letter from Mr Vanuxem, and the bill of &s;ales of Mr Footman auc|tioneer. This ve&s;&s;el left the wharf on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t to heave down.</P>
<P>"When this Ve&s;&s;el unloaded the coffee, Mr. Vanuxem at|te&s;ts that no &s;mell whatever was ob&s;erved, but after &s;he was unloaded, a mo&s;t intolerable &s;tench was occa&s;ioned for two or three days, while the &s;ailors were clearing the hold of the bilge water, which in all ve&s;&s;els when &s;uffered to &s;tagnate, becomes putrid and is very offen&s;ive, but has never been ob&s;erved to pro|duce a yellow or any other contagious fever.</P>
<P>It is true the captain and hands were &s;ick while employed in clearing the water out of the hold, but as "they all recovered within three days without the aid of medicine," it cannot be &s;u&s;pected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> had the Yellow Fever. Nothing is more co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> than for people's &s;tomachs to be un&s;ettled by fetid bilge water, and to be rendered weak from expo&s;ure to the noxious air generated in neglected holds, as we learn from the ob&s;ervations of Lind and Blane, but they tell us nothing of Yellow fever from this &s;ource.</P>
<P>The other Ve&s;&s;el which arrived at the &s;ame wharf, about the &s;ame time, together with the Sans Culottes privateer, and her prize, the &s;hip Flora of Gla&s;gow had &s;topped at Che&s;ter, where the Ma&s;ter, Hamilton Sage, died with unequivocal &s;ymptom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Yellow Fever at Mr William Kerlins, as appears from a letter to me from Dr. William Martin of that place.</P>
<P>Mr Kirlin, who received compen&s;ation for the trouble and expences he had been at on account of the captain, from Mr. Vanuxem, declares that there were &s;everal pa&s;&s;engers &s;ick on board the Ve&s;&s;el when &s;he left Che&s;ter.</P>
<P>Several &s;ick per&s;ons were al&s;o &s;een coming on &s;hore at Mr. Vanuxems, and Mr Lemaigre's wharfs, between the 25th of
<PB N="14" REF="026836_0013_0FD1E1EA2BA4DA00">
July and the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, by Major Hodg&s;on, Mr Lemaigre, his Clerk, Mr A&s;hbridge, his wife, and &s;everal other re&s;pec|table people, who re&s;ided in Water-&s;treet near to the &s;u&s;pected wharfs, and &s;ome were buried at different times with evident &s;ymptoms of the Yellow Fever from on board tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e not being at fir&s;t &s;u&s;pected to be contagious pre|vented the&s;e from being particularly noticed, till it was too late to make effectual enquiry.</P>
<P>A re&s;pectable citizen of Philadelphia, &s;upercargo of one of our ve&s;&s;els, informed Mr. M. Carey, that he &s;aw in July &s;ix or &s;even people &s;ick of this fever, on board a brig at Cape Francois bound to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Several upon coming on &s;hore went into Mr Lemaigre's, and Mr Vanuxem's kitchens, to re&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But if it could not be proved that any one came &s;ick on &s;hore, it is no argument again&s;t the contagion having been brought in goods clo&s;e packed from the i&s;lands; medical records are full of &s;uch in&s;tances.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o numerous in&s;tances of people in clo&s;e and con|fined places, generating a contagion which is communicable to others, though they are in&s;en&s;ible to it them&s;elves, &s;ee Stow's Chronicle, Meads paper on infection, Blane's ob&s;ervations, &amp;c.</P>
<P>From all the foregoing circum&s;tances &s;ingly and collectively, I think I may fairly conclude without he&s;itation, that the di&s;|ea&s;e was introduced by importation, and was not generated in this city, and that a different opinion is a reflection upon the credit of its &s;alubrity which was never before called in que&s;tion, and which all former bills of mortality demon&s;trate, it does not de&s;erve. By the&s;e bills it appears that there has never more died in a year than in the proportion of one in 50 &s;ince the introduc|tion of inoculation, except when the Yellow Fever was intro|duced into it from the We&s;t Indies: whereas in mo&s;t of the cities of Europe, there dies every year in the proportion of 1 in 20 or 30 at mo&s;t.</P>
<P>To &s;atisfy every impartial per&s;on that the di&s;ea&s;e was import|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> into this city from the We&s;t Indies la&s;t &s;ummer, he has only to recollect that every time it appeared before in this country, whether in Carolina, Virginia or Penn&s;ylvania, it was always traced to importation. For proofs of this I appeal to Gough's hi&s;tory of the Society of Friends, vol. iii. p. 516, Lind on infec|tion; Lining's account of its &s;everal occurrences in Charle&s;town. Dr. Mitchels letter to Dr. Franklin re&s;pecting its appearance in Virginia in 1741. Dr. Redman's notes read in the College of Phy&s;icians la&s;t fall, giving an account of it in 1762. When it
<PB N="15" REF="026836_0014_0FD1E1ECDE4C1E68">
appeared in New York in 1791, its origin was never enquired into. It has been a&s;cribed by Dr. Addoms of that place in his di&s;&s;ertation on it, to &s;pecific contagion, but how generated or from whence brought, he does not &s;ay. Let the reader al&s;o recollect that the di&s;ea&s;e is peculiar to, and is always exi&s;ting more or le&s;s among tho&s;e who emigrate to tropical climates, and that when exported from thence it has never become epide|mic except in very hot weather, and in the atmo&s;phere peculiar to a town, or confined place; that it has never exi&s;ted or been active in this country under any other circum&s;tances, and that like mo&s;t other pe&s;tilential fevers, it is de&s;troyed entirely by cold and fro&s;t; and let him &s;ub&s;cribe to the opinion that it was gene|rated here, if he can.</P>
