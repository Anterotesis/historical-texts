<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the follwing Di&s;cour&s;e may probably fall in|to the Hands of Some, not acquainted with the &s;pecial Occa&s;ion, on which it was preached; 'tis apprehended the following brief Account may not be im|proper. The joyful News of the Repeal of the <HI>Stamp Act,</HI> arriving while the General A&s;&s;embly were &s;itting in this Town, they thought fit to direct that the two Military Companies in the Town, &s;hould be rai&s;ed, and the Cannon fired, &amp;c. at the public Expence. In Pur&s;uance of this Order, on the <HI>23</HI>d of May, a large Quantity of Powder was removed from the Colony's Store, into the New-Brick School-Hou&s;e, to be deliver|ed out to the Soldiers and u&s;ed for other Purpo&s;es, on this Joyful Occa&s;ion. A Number of Young Gentlemen meet in the Chamber of the Hou&s;e over the Room where the Powder was depo&s;ited, to prepare Sky-Rockets, &amp;c. to be played off in the Evening. In delivering out the Powder to the Soldiery, a con&s;iderable Quantity was &s;cattered on the Ground round about the Hou&s;e: This being ob&s;erved by &s;ome Children at play, they carele&s;sly put Fire to the &s;cattered Powder, which communicated it&s;elf to that within the Hou&s;e, in&s;tantly blew it up, and buried about Thirty Per&s;ons in its Ruins. Thus did GOD in a Moment turn our Rejoicing into Mourn|ing, and our Merriment into Lamentation and Sor|row&mdash;&mdash;When this Explo&s;ion fir&s;t happened, every One expected that all Tho&s;e within the Hou&s;e, at lea&s;t, were gone to the Place of Silence; but GOD was bet|ter

Doct.</HI> Nathaniel Ledyard, <HI>Me&s;s'rs</HI> William Gar|diner, Levi Jones, John Knowles, Richard Lord, Richard Burham.</NOTE> in a great Mea&s;ure recovered. In the Mid&s;t of this &s;ore Cala|mity, the Goodne&s;s of God was very remarkably &s;een in &s;undry In&s;tances&mdash;One of the Military Companies had but ju&s;t left the Hou&s;e, before the Explo&s;ion hap|pened; a con&s;iderable Number of Children were &s;ent away, almo&s;t that very In&s;tant, by &s;ome Gentlemen who had the Conduct of the Affair. As I am told, had this Explo&s;ion happened almo&s;t at any other Time of the Day, between Nine in the Morning, and Five in the Afternoon, much greater Numbers would have been expo&s;ed. Both the Mini&s;ters in the Town being by Sickne&s;s confined from public Service, the worthy Author, then on a Journey, was prevailed with to tarry over the Sabbath, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in our Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and to &s;upply the Pulpit. The following Di&s;cour&s;e, then delivered, is now made public, at the De&s;ire of the Hearers. And I take this Opportunity to return him my &s;incere&s;t Thanks, for his great Humanity and Kind|ne&s;s to this People in that Time of &s;ore Vi&s;itation, when I was providentially hindred from being help|ful to them my&s;elf: Al&s;o to expre&s;s my mo&s;t earne&s;t Wi&s;hes, that his Labour of Love might be rewarded. And that the following Di&s;cour&s;e may be &s;anctified, for the be&s;t Good of this People, for who&s;e Benefit it was more immediately intended.</P>

<P>_THAT awful and alarming Provi|vidence, which many of us beheld, that &s;udden Explo&s;ion, than which nothing but the Lightning &s;eems more in&s;tantaneous, which buried many in the Ruins of that Hou&s;e, erected for the In&s;truction of Youth, and &s;ent &s;everal of your Number away, to appear before the Bar of GOD&punc; calls us to a mournful Meeting, invites our Minds to Improvement, our Hearts to &s;en&s;ible Sorrow for the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our Neighbours, and would render a Teacher inexcu&s;eable, &s;hould he not endeavour to chu&s;e &s;uitable Words upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="010282_0004_0F7E711FA0828668">PROVIDENTIALLY with you, at a &s;hort Warn|ing, in all the Confu&s;ion and Con&s;ternation of &s;uch a Di&s;a&s;ter, I mean to a&s;k your Candor for much Inchoherence; and intreat the Auditory to accept the &s;incere De&s;ires of a Stranger, endea|vouring to a&s;&s;i&s;t your Minds upon this &s;ad Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>LET me attempt a brief Explanation of the Words before us, to &s;horten the Work, and ren|der the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e more ea&s;y to the Mind.</P>
<P>CUSTOM determined the ea&s;tern Nations to the U&s;e of long Garments, very unhandy for Exer|ci&s;e, and to the U&s;e of the Girdle, wherewith they girded up their Garments enwrapped about their Loins, that they might not be entangled with them; but as much as po&s;&s;ible, con&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch Dre&s;s, be unincumbered, and ready for Ser|vice.&mdash;Thus our SAVIOUR u&s;eth the Phra&s;e more than once, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Luke 17, 8.</NOTE> <HI>Make ready, wherewith I may &s;up, and gird thy&s;elf, and &s;erve me.</HI>&mdash;<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">John 21, 18.</NOTE> <HI>And another &s;hall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou would&s;t not.</HI></P>
<P>'TWAS al&s;o a Cu&s;tom among the Jews to cele|brate their Nuptials by Night; and 'tis common for our SAVIOUR to repre&s;ent Death, the final Pe|riod of our probation State, by the coming of the Bridegroom. The&s;e Words are an Allu&s;ion to tho&s;e ea&s;tern Cu&s;toms, pregnant with In&s;truction to them that live in the Belief of a future State of Rewards and Puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>Here then I would,</P>
<P N="1">I. Endeavour to &s;how what we may under&s;tand by this Command: <HI>Let your Loins be girded about.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="010282_0004_0F7E711FA0828668">II. Point out the Chri&s;tian Duty, enjoined in the&s;e Words: <HI>And your Lights burning.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. That this, and this only, will prepare us for the immediate Summons of Death.</P>
<P N="1">I. WHAT we are to under&s;tand by this Com|mand: <HI>Let your Loins be girded about.</HI> As it was the Garment, &s;omething nece&s;&s;ary for us in this fallen State; &s;o,</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is a plain Command, not indeed to throw off all Concerns and worldly Incumbrance; no, not even that which Cu&s;tom and Ornament may dictate; but 'tis a Direction to put our near, out|ward, worldly Concerns in &s;uch a Po&s;ition, as &s;hall lea&s;t hinder and embarra&s;s us in our LORD's Ser|vice. We mu&s;t have Food and Raiment, and con&s;equently Care in providing, and &s;ome little Time, at lea&s;t, in u&s;ing them. What our LORD would, is, that we &s;hould not &s;uffer the&s;e, which are de&s;igned for the Comfort of the outward Man, de&s;igned to help us forward in the Way; not &s;uf|fer them to perplex, confound, hinder, or embar|ra&s;s us in our chri&s;tian Warfare, our faithful Service &mdash;let them not hang upon us like dead Weights, nor drag after us, to hinder our Advance, or en|tangle our Feet. Many the Snares, many the En|tanglements, from outward Things, unle&s;s they are kept in proper Decorum, and wi&s;e Arrangement, by human Prudence, and Direction of the li|ving, all-wi&s;e GOD. Whatever Service, whatever Employment, whatever Circum&s;tances we are in, or may be called to in Life; 'tis the Chri&s;tian's Duty, to make outward Things, Accidents and

<P N="2">2. Be&s;ides all Embarra&s;ment from outward Things, 'tis a Direction to us, to have and hold our Minds, free for Service, &s;o unincumbred with the Cares of worldly Things, Plans, Pur&s;uits, Engagements, or Enjoyments, that we can any Moment, calmly advert to Death, look forward to the Grave, and view the final Judgment, as al|ready &s;et, the Books opened, the Judge pre|&s;ent, and the Award ju&s;t ready to be given, ac|cording to the Deeds done in the Body.&mdash;<HI>Gird up the Loins of your Minds,</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 1, 13.</NOTE> &amp;c.
