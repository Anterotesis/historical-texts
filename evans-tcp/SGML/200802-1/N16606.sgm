</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of divine providence, I am, this day, called, my dear friends, to bid you <HI>farewell</HI>&mdash; You are, this day, to hear my parting addre&s;s. To bid you farewell (if it is any thing more than mere compliment; if there is any &s;ignificancy in the phra&s;e) implies a &s;incere wi&s;h that you may be truly happy; happy in time, and happy through eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="021351_0003_0FB31A71EB4214D8">But you never can be happy; you cannot fare|well in the pre&s;ent world, much le&s;s can you farewell in the world to come without the knowledge and practice or tho&s;e things, which he, upon whom all your temporal and eternal welfare entirely depends, has commanded you to know and ob&s;erve. If you are diligent in obtaining the knowledge, and faithful in pur&s;uing the practice of tho&s;e important truths, which the God of nature and the God of grace has revealed in his works and in his word, then I can not only bid you farewell (i. e. &s;incerely <HI>wi&s;h</HI> your wel|fare) but al&s;o a&s;&s;ure you that you <HI>actually</HI> will forev|er farewell. That you will farewell while travelling through this vale of tears. That you will farewell when pa&s;&s;ing through the valley of the &s;hadow of death. That you will farewell in your intermedi|ate &s;tate: That you will farewell in the morning of the re&s;urrection. That you will farewell in the &s;o|lemn proce&s;s of the la&s;t great deci&s;ive day: That you will farewell through the revolution of numberle&s;s millions of ages: That you will farewell amid&s;t all the new, &s;urprizing, and infinitely various &s;cenes that even a whole eternity can produce.</P>
<P><HI>If ye know the&s;e things, happy are ye if ye do them.</HI> The&s;e words were &s;poken by the benevolent Je&s;us, ju&s;t before his crucifixion, to his di&s;ciples. See the context, <HI>ver.</HI> 1&mdash;12.</P>
<P>IN the pro&s;ecution of the pre&s;ent &s;ubject we &s;hall, through divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, attempt to exhibit a brief view of the <HI>doctrines</HI> you mu&s;t know, and the <HI>duties</HI> you mu&s;t do, in order that you may be happy; that you may farewell.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not pretend in this di&s;cour&s;e, to give a complete methodical &s;y&s;tem of all the doctrines and duties of religion: but &s;hall only mention &s;ome im|portant, e&s;&s;ential things, which if you know, happy are you if you do them. It is propo&s;ed,</P>
<P N="1">I. To exhibit a brief view of the doctrines which you mu&s;t know.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="021351_0004_0FB31A73DD29FCF8" MS="y">That peculiar kind of exi&s;tence which we call KNOWLEDGE, and which is no where to be found but only in the mind of a thinking, intelligent being, always has truth for its object.</P>
<P>So happily are things con&s;tituted by the great au|thor of nature; the &s;upreme &s;ource of all intelligence &mdash;That it is impo&s;&s;ible that any thing which is not <HI>really true,</HI> &s;hould be <HI>certainly known</HI> to be true: admitting this principle, then it nece&s;&s;arily follows, That whatever is <HI>certainly known</HI> to be true, is <HI>really true.</HI> Hence it is evident, That if five, ten, twenty, an hundred or a thou&s;and per&s;ons (be the number greater or le&s;s) know any thing to be true, then they will, in this re&s;pect, not only all agree with <HI>each other,</HI> but they will al&s;o all agree, or harmonize with the <HI>object</HI> of <HI>knowledge.</HI> This being the ca&s;e, there is a foundation for complete happine&s;s in the intellectu|al world. Let all the individuals of the whole in|telligent &s;y&s;tem, according to their re&s;pective capaci|ties, <HI>know</HI> the truth, and all <HI>embrace</HI> the truth they know, then there will not only be a harmony between the <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> and the <HI>heart</HI> in each individual, con&s;idered by him&s;elf, and a harmony among all the individuals con&s;idered with relation to each other, but al&s;o each individual <HI>&s;eparately,</HI> and all the in|dividuals <HI>collectively,</HI> will harmonize with one <HI>common object</HI>; all their views and affections will have one <HI>common center.</HI> They will con&s;equently all be happy, &mdash;they will all farewell.</P>
<P>If any number of per&s;ons certainly know any thing to be true, then the&s;e per&s;ons do, in this re&s;pect, per|fectly agree together in their ideas; and not only &s;o, but al&s;o the ideas of each individual, perfectly agree with the object of knowledge. There is, therefore, in this ca&s;e, a perfect harmony of &s;entiment: a har|mony founded in immutable truth, and the eternal nature of things. Hence it is evident, that all di&s;|putes and difference of &s;entiment originate in the <HI>ig|norance</HI> of one or both of the contending parties. For as has been already intimated, knowledge univer&s;ally
<PB N="6" REF="021351_0005_0FB31A7566D32DB0">
implies an agreement in &s;entiment, difference in &s;enti|ment, therefore, univer&s;ally proceeds from ignorance.</P>
<P>Should any one be &s;o bold as to a&s;&s;ert,&mdash;"That there is no &s;uch thing as truth:" or (&s;uppo&s;ing that there is truth) "that there is no &s;uch thing as know|ledge:" I &s;hould think my&s;elf authorized to be e|qually bold to tell &s;uch a per&s;on, in reply, that there was no <HI>truth</HI> in his a&s;&s;ertion: or, at lea&s;t, that he was <HI>ignorant</HI> of what he &s;aid. For any one to &s;ay "That it is <HI>true</HI> there is no &s;uch thing as <HI>truth</HI>:" or, "That he <HI>knows</HI> there is no &s;uch thing as <HI>knowledge,</HI>" is to &s;ay that which is &s;elf-contradictory, and there|fore utterly unworthy of any regard. No one can de|ny the exi&s;tence of truth, without appearing in the character of a complete <HI>liar.</HI> For he that adopts the principle, "That there is no &s;uch thing as truth:" can claim no right to the character of a man of truth, &s;incerity, or hone&s;ty. He can claim no right to be regarded as being <HI>true</HI> in any of his <HI>words</HI> or <HI>actions.</HI> Neither can any one deny the exi&s;tence of knowledge, without appearing in the character of a perfect <HI>fool.</HI> For he that adopts the principle "that there is no &s;uch thing as knowledge," never can, con&s;i&s;tently, pretend to be a man of any knowledge or good &s;en&s;e. All, therefore, who would not ap|pear in the character of perfect <HI>knaves</HI> or <HI>fools</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily admit that there is in nature <HI>immutable truth</HI> and <HI>infallible knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>Truth is the foundation of knowledge, and know|ledge the foundation of practice. In the knowledge and practice of truth; or in other words expre&s;&s;ive of the &s;ame idea, in a complete harmony of &s;entiments and actions, all having relation to one common ob|ject, con&s;i&s;ts the perfection of the whole intelligent &s;y&s;tem, and of all the individuals of which the whole &s;y&s;tem is compo&s;ed. In the knowledge and practice of tho&s;e things, which the great author of your nat|ure has injoined, and in this way only, you may obtain happine&s;s: happine&s;s which has a foundation
<PB N="7" REF="021351_0006_0FB31A776E416288">
as exten&s;ive as univer&s;al truth, and la&s;ting as your immortal &s;ouls.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now, as was propo&s;ed, immediately pro|ceed to exhibit a brief view of &s;ome important e&s;&s;en|tial doctrines, which, in order that you may be happy, you mu&s;t know.</P>
<P>Without entering on a long detail of particulars, we &s;hall only ju&s;t mention &s;ome things relative to the being and perfections of God; the nature of the di|vine law, the beauty of holine&s;s; the deformity of &s;in; the nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration; the death of the body; the immortality of the &s;oul; the general re|&s;urrection; the final judgment; the eternal &s;tates of rewards and puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not attempt, at pre&s;ent, to give a formal proof, nor enter on a curious and critical demon&s;tra|tion, but &s;hall only briefly remind you of the&s;e things, taking it for granted that you know them already: Or to u&s;e the language of the Apo&s;tle Peter, <HI>To put you in remembrance of the&s;e things though ye know them, and be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the pre&s;ent truth.</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. i, 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>THAT THERE IS A GOD, "all nature cries aloud through all her works." <HI>The invi&s;ible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly &s;een, being un|der&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Rom. i.20.</NOTE> <HI>He has not left him&s;elf with|out witne&s;s, in that he does good and gives rain from heaven, and fruitful &s;ea&s;ons, filling our hearts with food and gladne&s;s.</HI><NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Acts xiv, 17.</NOTE> <HI>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament &s;heweth his handy work. Day unto day uttereth &s;peech, and night unto night &s;howeth know|ledge.</HI><NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">P&s;a. x<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">x, 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of the deity is &s;o evident that it nev|er can with any pretence of rea&s;on be denied. It nev|er has, and never will be &s;aid by any but <HI>fools,</HI> "that there is no God." There can be no <HI>effect</HI> without a <HI>cau&s;e.</HI> Nor can there be any <HI>particular,</HI> &s;econdary cau&s;e, without a <HI>univer&s;al</HI> fir&s;t cau&s;e. If, therefore,
<PB N="8" REF="021351_0007_0FB31A7858A5FF60">
there is no God, that is, no <HI>creator,</HI> then there are no <HI>creatures,</HI> and, con&s;equently, no beings to affirm or deny the exi&s;tence of a God. Therefore, if there are any beings to affirm or deny the exi&s;tence of a God, then a God exi&s;ts. To &s;ay "there is no God," is the &s;ame as to &s;ay "there is no truth," and to &s;ay, "there is no truth" <HI>is a lie.</HI></P>
<P>God is that awful and glorious Being, who immut|ably and eternally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, in the highe&s;t degree, all po&s;&s;ible perfection. His proper name is JEHOVAH: which &s;ignifies an eternal &s;elf-exi&s;tent being: or, as it is expre&s;&s;ed in the Revelation of St. John, a being <HI>who was is, and is to come.</HI> God is a &s;pirit, infinite, eternal, immutable, &s;elf-exi&s;tent, &s;elf-&s;ufficient, omni|potent, omni&s;cient: po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing un&s;earchable wi&s;dom, boundle&s;s goodne&s;s, immaculate holine&s;s, impartial ju&s;tice, and infallible truth. There are three per&s;ons in the divine nature. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The&s;e three per&s;ons are ONE GOD. All the &s;acred Three are engaged in the redemption of fallen man. We are to conceive of this glorious redemption as being <HI>contrived</HI> by the Father, <HI>executed</HI> by the Son, and <HI>applied</HI> by the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>THE DIVINE LAW is, like its author, ab&s;olutely perfect; being holy, ju&s;t and good; requiring com|plete uninterrupted, perpetual obedience of every intelligent moral agent in the univer&s;e. It is &s;um|med up in the following words: <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy &s;trength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI><NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Luke x, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE></P>
<P>Rational beings, by being made capable of <HI>moral action,</HI> become the proper &s;ubjects of the <HI>moral law,</HI> and are rendered accountable to the <HI>moral governor</HI> of the world. Every moral action is either <HI>conform|able</HI> or <HI>not conformable</HI> to the moral law. Hence there are <HI>two &s;pecies</HI> of moral action. Every moral action, which is conformable to the moral law, is cal|led
<PB N="9" REF="021351_0008_0FB31A79CD8DD170">
HOLINESS. Holine&s;s is, in its own nature, mo&s;t excellent, beautiful, and amiable, and di&s;plays, to every unprejudiced mind, the mo&s;t captivating charms. It is the very image of the Deity.</P>
<P>The other &s;pecies of moral action, viz. that which is not conformable to the moral law, is called SIN. Sin is of a mo&s;t deformed and hateful nature&mdash; it is a horrid mon&s;ter, pregnant with wo&mdash;it is the fruitful &s;ource of all the confu&s;ion and mi&s;ery that ever has, or ever will take place in Jehovah's dominions. But though &s;in has a mo&s;t de&s;tructive t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ency, is, in its own nature, calculated to di&s;turb the whole &s;y&s;tem of intelligent beings, throw the univer&s;e into the ut|mo&s;t di&s;order, and &s;hake the foundations of nature even to the throne of God; yet being under the ab|&s;olute controul of the &s;upreme Governor, all the terrible effects of its operation are entirely confined to the SINNER, i. e. the <HI>Author</HI> of &s;in: &s;o that it never can, in the final re&s;ult of things, be, in the lea&s;t degree, injurious to any holy beings.

And if, through the divine ble&s;&s;ing, you &s;hould obtain &s;uch a one, be careful to <HI>pray</HI> for him&mdash;diligently attend on his mi|ni&s;try&mdash;treat him with <HI>kindne&s;s tenderne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>can|dour</HI>&mdash;endeavour, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to comfort, &s;up|port, encourage, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his <HI>arduous</HI> work; and give him &s;uch <HI>honour</HI> and <HI>re&s;pect</HI> as is &s;uitable to his <HI>character.</HI> For you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that one, who, from whatever cau&s;e, is <HI>&s;lighted</HI> and <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed,</HI> can have but a very &s;mall influence in &s;peaking; even tho' what he &s;ays &s;hould be of the greate&s;t importance

<P>And &s;hould you be &s;o happy as to have one among you, who (to u&s;e the language of the Apo&s;tle) <HI>&s;ows unto you</HI> &s;piritual <HI>things.</HI> You mu&s;t not think <HI>it a great thing that he &s;hould reap your</HI> carnal <HI>things&mdash;For who goeth a warfare, any time, at his own charges?
