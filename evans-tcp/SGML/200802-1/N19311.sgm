<L>Then with the &s;un a ri&s;ing journey went,</L>
<L>Sedate to think, and watching each event.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The morn was wa&s;ted in the path|le&s;s gra&s;s,</L>

<L>And talk of various kinds deceiv'd the road;</L>
<L>Till each with other pleas'd, and loth to part,</L>

<L>Thus &s;tands an aged elm in ivy bound,</L>

<L>It chanc'd, the noble ma&s;ter of the dome</L>

<L>Their lord receives them at the pomp|ous gate;</L>
<L>The table groans with co&s;tly piles of food,</L>

<L>Then led to re&s;t, the day's long toil they drown,</L>
<L>Deep &s;unk in &s;leep, and &s;ilk, and heaps of down.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length 'tis morn&punc; and at the dawn of day</L>

<L>Rich, lu&s;cious wine a golden goblet grac'd,</L>

<L>And, but the landlord, none had cau&s;e of woe;</L>
<L>His cup was vani&s;h'd; for in &s;ecret gui&s;e</L>
<L>The younger gue&s;t purloin'd the glit|tering prize.</L>

<L>Gli&s;t'ning and ba&s;king in the &s;ummer ray,</L>

<L>And o'er their heads loud rolling thunder ran.</L>
<L>Here long they knock, but knock or call in vain,</L>
<L>Driv'n by the wind, and batter'd by the rain.</L>
<L>At length &s;ome pity warm'd the ma&s;|ter's brea&s;t:</L>
