<P>THE pre&s;ent &s;tate is a mixed &s;tate. This is &s;o as to individuals, and al&s;o to communities. In the cour&s;e of God's providence, pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity &s;uc|ceed eath other; and there is oftentimes a quick tran&s;ition from one to the other. It is in this ca&s;e as it is in the cour&s;e of nature: When all is bright, &s;erene and chear|ful, a &s;torm &s;uddenly ari&s;es, and rages with great impetuo|&s;ity and violence, and in &s;ome &s;ituations great is the di&s;|tre&s;s and mi&s;ery occa&s;ioned thereby. After which all be|comes calm and bright again. Neither individuals nor communities "in their pro&s;perity may &s;ay, they &s;hall never be moved." When they imagine their "mountain &s;tands &s;trong," it is ea&s;y with God to &s;hake it even to its centre; to throw them down from the pinnacle of ea&s;e, grandeur, wealth and affluence&mdash;and it is ea&s;y for him
<PB N="6" REF="014830_0004_0F9789FB9A209D28">
again to exalt them.&mdash;To be rai&s;ed from a low, de|pre&s;&s;ed &s;tate, is agreeable to nature. Mankind naturally de&s;ire pro&s;perity, and deprecate adver&s;ity. Adver&s;ity, e&s;|pecially in remarkable in&s;tances of it, &s;preads a gloom over them, and they are ready to de&s;pond and give up all for lo&s;t. They view the dark &s;ide of things, and dwell upon them in their mournful contemplations, not con&s;i|dering that the great Governor of the world can cau&s;e light to &s;pring up out of darkne&s;s, rever&s;e the &s;cene, and bring good out of evil. They are apt to forget pa&s;t mer|cies, and to overlook tho&s;e which God intermixes with their adver&s;ities, and &s;o are unapt and indi&s;po&s;ed to make their proper acknowledgments to him.</P>
<P>THERE are two grand and important duties, which, both rea&s;on and the word of God call men to, con&s;ider|ing him as the great orderer and di&s;po&s;er of all events both good and evil&mdash;<HI>Prayer,</HI> for the be&s;towment of needed good&mdash;and <HI>prai&s;e</HI> for the receipt of it. Con&s;idering our&s;elves as needy creatures, the duty of prayer is of continual obli|gation. And con&s;idering our&s;elves as the daily &s;ubjects of the mercies of God, the duty of prai&s;e is al&s;o of conti|nual obligation. It was from an impre&s;ive &s;en&s;e of this, that the pious P&s;almi&s;t utters him&s;elf, as in the words of our text. "I will ble&s;s the Lord at all times, his prai&s;e &s;hall be <HI>continually</HI> in my mouth."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>
<L>THRO all the changing &s;cenes of life,</L>

<L>my heart and tongue employ.</L>

<BIBL>TATE and BRADY'S ver&s;ion of the text.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="014830_0005_0F9789FCDCD69180">
THE words plainly import this&mdash;That God's crea|tures, at all times, and under all circum&s;tances and con|ditions of life, have occa&s;ion to prai&s;e and ble&s;s him.</P>
<P>NONE &s;urely will call it in que&s;tion, that they have &s;uch occa&s;ion in times of pro&s;perity; when the a&s;pects of divine providence are agreeable and plea&s;ant. Men mu&s;t be lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of God, and of their obligations to him, not to acknowledge that prai&s;e is a ju&s;t tribute due to him on account of his favours and benefits. There are few indeed that will carry matters to &s;uch a length as this, &s;peculatively, whatever they may do practically. That they do &s;o practically, is the ca&s;e in a multitude of in|&s;tances. Though they are the &s;ubjects of many and great favours at the hands of God, yet they have no grateful &s;en&s;e of them, and are gro&s;sly negligent in making their acknowledgements to him. Their own rea&s;on, if they only appeal to that, mu&s;t utterly condemn them for &s;uch unworthy treatment of their Maker and bounteous Bene|factor.</P>
<P>It may be made evident, that in times of evil and ca|lamity, men have <HI>even</HI> then occa&s;ion to prai&s;e God. Surely then they have &s;o, when it is clear, bright &s;un|&s;hine with them. "I will ble&s;s the Lord at all times, &s;ays David, his prai&s;e &s;hall be continually in my mouth."</P>
<P>EVILS and calamities, it is true, in them&s;elves, whether per&s;onal or publick, "are not joyous, but grievous." Thus it is as to bodily &s;ickne&s;s and pain. Thus al&s;o is
<PB N="8" REF="014830_0006_0F9789FD34E35E20">
it, when droughts and pe&s;tilences are &s;ent into a land, and when their peace and tranquility is interrupted by the &s;word of war.&mdash;Such calamities as the&s;e, undoubtedly call for deep humiliation before God, as hereby he te&s;tifies his anger and di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t a land for the many and heinous iniquities that abound in it. The&s;e mo&s;t cer|tainly, are the procuring cau&s;e of them. If piety and vir|tue univer&s;ally prevailed, no evils or judgments would be &s;ent upon a land. The moral &s;tate of a people, we may well &s;uppo&s;e, influences the moral Governor of the world in his conduct towards them, either in a way of favour or calamity.</P>
<P>BUT although judgments, &s;uch as we ju&s;t mentioned, are to be con&s;idered as tokens of God's anger again&s;t pre|vailing iniquities, and in this view call for deep humilia|tion before a holy and offended Sovereign, yet con&s;i&s;tent with this, occa&s;ion is then offered for prai&s;e.&mdash;For "God, who does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men," who delights not in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es and mi&s;eries, has merciful de&s;igns towards them in his judi|cial di&s;pen&s;ations. He de&s;igns to humble them and pu|rify them; to bring them to true repentance, to reform all their vices and immoralities, to reduce them to the love and practice of univer&s;al piety, godline&s;s and righte|ou&s;ue&s;s, and in this way to prepare them for his &s;miles and ble&s;&s;ings in all regards. For "righteou&s;ne&s;s" has a moral as well as natural tendency to "exalt a nation" or people. If now, &s;uch are the merciful de&s;igns of the
<PB N="9" REF="014830_0007_0F978A001FD788F8">
great Governor of the world, when he &s;ends evils and calamities upon a land, then occa&s;ion is hereby mini&s;tred for prai&s;e to his great name.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ign of Heaven in calamitous di&s;pen&s;ations, may be to bring people to that, which his kind and merciful ones have been ineffectual to. For although the merciful di&s;pen&s;ations of GOD, e&s;pecially a long &s;eries of them, and in great and mo&s;t important re&s;pects, ought in all rea&s;on to engage men's unfeigned gratitude, and put them upon manife&s;ting it in a life of true godline&s;s and virtue, yet frequently they have not &s;uch a de&s;ireable effect as this.&mdash;Their ca&s;e is often, much as it is &s;aid of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> that they "wa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> fat and kick." While they talk of a long &s;ea&s;on in the &s;un-&s;hine of the divine favours, they are unmindful of their great benefactor, riot in his bounties and make them the fewel of their lu&s;ts. Thus evilly do they requite the Lord who has done &s;o many good things for them.&mdash;The holy GOD who is hereby greatly di&s;honored, &s;ees fit to alter the &s;cene, to take his rod in his hand and to cha&s;ti&s;e them, and &s;ometimes very &s;orely; that hereby they may be reduced to &s;uch an obediential conduct as his manifold mercies were ineffectual to bring them to. And &s;o by his altering his hand, he de&s;igns upon the whole, their benefit and advantage. For if they are brought to that humilia|tion, godline&s;s and virtue, which GOD expects of them, great is the advantage and benefit re&s;ulting to them from his judicial di&s;pen&s;ations, however &s;ore and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing.&mdash;They are then prepared for the removal of them, and for the return of GOD'S favours and ble&s;&s;ings in all de&s;irable in&s;tances of them, &s;o that on the whole here, there is occa&s;ion to prai&s;e GOD in times of evil and calamity; not for evils and calamities in them|&s;elves
<PB N="10" REF="014830_0008_0F978A0118C82D60">
con&s;idered, but for the good ends GOD has in bring|ing them on.</P>
<P>BUT then it may be further ob&s;erved&mdash;That &s;ometimes, yea, for the mo&s;t part, there are many po&s;itive mercies en|joyed in times of evil.</P>
<P>INDIVIDUALS for the mo&s;t part find it &s;o. It is not often that their &s;tate, though greatly afflicted, is yet quite forlorn and de&s;perate. If they are in pain and &s;ickne&s;s of body, yet they may have comfortable hou&s;es, lodging, medicines, food and fewel, and the tender care and help of near and affectionate friends, all which &s;erve in &s;ome mea&s;ure to &s;weeten bitter cups, to lighten heavy burdens, and to keep them from &s;inking under the pre&s;&s;ure of their troubles.&mdash;So al&s;o, per&s;ons &s;ometimes meet with &s;orrowful bereavements. Tho&s;e that were near and dear to them are taken away, up|on whom they were wont to place their hopes, and from whom they expected to have much comfort. But then others are &s;pared to them, and &s;ometimes when they have been in the like dangerous circum&s;tances as tho&s;e that have been taken away, &s;ickne&s;s has been removed from their families, and the voice of health and &s;alvation again heard in them.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e and other in&s;tances that might be mentioned, there is mercy intermixed with afflictions. And at the &s;ame time that they are called to humiliation and mourning, they have yet abundant occa&s;ion for thankfulne&s;s and prai&s;e to GOD. In &s;hort, there is no condition that per&s;ons may be in, but upon a view of all circum&s;tances, they may find mat|ter for prai&s;e to GOD. And con&s;idering their de&s;erts at his hands, their utter unworthine&s;s before him, by rea&s;on of their vilene&s;s, ingratitude, di&s;obedience and rebellion towards his &s;acred maje&s;ty, they may with the &s;tricte&s;t ju&s;tice take up that

<P>THE &s;ame ob&s;ervation with re&s;pect to individuals, holds true with re&s;pect to communities. Sometimes after a long Sun-&s;hine, GOD "creates darkne&s;s." After a long calm, he rai&s;es a &s;torm, and cau&s;es it to beat fiercely upon them. The &s;tate of their affairs wear a different a&s;pect from what they did not long before. A very gloomy pro&s;pect opens before them, and it may &s;eem as if utter ruin and de&s;truction awaited them.</P>
<P>THOSE terrible calamities of war, pe&s;tilence and drought come in the room of peace, health and plenty. The&s;e ble&s;&s;|ings they may have long been in the enjoyment of, but did not &s;ufficiently prize them; but in having the &s;cene &s;o; changed and altered, they are brought to know the worth of what they once enjoyed.&mdash;But now, upon a view of all circum&s;tances, much of the goodne&s;s of GOD is to be &s;een amid&s;t all the&s;e evils, and they have occa&s;ion for prai&s;e as well as humiliation.</P>
<P>THIS that I have now &s;aid, holds true with re&s;pect to us in this land.</P>
<P>For a long cour&s;e of years, there has been a very general and remarkable &s;tate of health throughout the land. No contagious mortal &s;ickne&s;s has GOD &s;ent into it, as was for|merly the ca&s;e. I need not mention in&s;tances here.&mdash;And by this means we have greatly increa&s;ed and multiplied, been enabled to extend our &s;ettlements, and many of them, though young, have greatly flouri&s;hed and pro&s;pered, and have bid fair to do &s;o more and more under the common
<PB N="12" REF="014830_0010_0F978A02561949A0">
&s;miles of Heaven. But in the &s;ummer pa&s;t GOD was plea&s;|ed to &s;end a mo&s;t grievous pe&s;tilence into the land, and great has been the mortality in one place and in another, and in &s;ome not far from us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The di&s;ea&s;e above alluded to was the Dy&s;entry, or as it is commonly called, the Camp Di&s;temper. A great mortality hereby, there was in the towns of SUTTON, MARLBOROUGH, GROTON, DEDHAM, as well as in divers other towns in this, as well as in the neighbouring governments.</NOTE> In this matter, GOD has dealt as favorably with us in this place, perhaps as with any in the land.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">But one &s;ingle per&s;on in this large, populous town, died of the above di&s;ea&s;e, many families were vi&s;ited, though not &s;everely. The family to which this per&s;on belonged was the mo&s;t &s;o. A large family, almo&s;t all vi&s;ited, but all recovered except this one.</NOTE> What &s;pecial cau&s;e for prai&s;e and thankfulne&s;s have we for his great goodne&s;s in &s;uch a time of calamity and di&s;tre&s;s? Is it, brethren! for our di&s;tingui&s;hing goodne&s;s, righteou&s;ne&s;s and virtue, that we have been thus favorably dealt with! This is a matter worthy our con&s;ideration. And if upon a &s;erious and impartial con&s;ideration, it &s;hall appear that we have been as obnoxious as others who have been vi&s;ited, the &s;paring mercy and goodne&s;s of GOD de|mands our unfeigned gratitude.&mdash;But then, with re&s;pect to the land in general, the fatal malady is greatly abated if not wholly &s;ub&s;ided. And the voice of health is again heard in our land. And this al&s;o, as members of the body demands our gratitude and prai&s;e to the great pre&s;erver of men.</P>
<P>IT may be added&mdash;that peace is a ble&s;&s;ing which for many years pa&s;t has been enjoyed in our land. No wars nor ru|mours of wars, no military campaigns and battels&mdash;"No confu&s;ed noi&s;e of warriors nor garments rolled in blood."
<PB N="13" REF="014830_0011_0F978A030FF3D4F0">
No people on the earth have in this re&s;pect been happier, or it may be, &s;o happy as we have been. Public peace and tranquility is a great and ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing. Men feel and enjoy them&s;elves in &s;uch a &s;tate, agreable to the rank they hold in the creation. Hereby &s;cope is given to popu|lation and increa&s;e&mdash;to the flouri&s;hing of the liberal and mechanic arts&mdash;to the increa&s;ing in their trade, commerce, navigation, &amp;c. and under the &s;miles of divine providence to their becoming great and opulent, and re&s;pectable both at home and abroad. When they dwell in peace, unmole&s;t|ed by enemies, they then bid fair to be in the agreable &s;itua|tion, that Mo&s;es in GOD'S name encourages the people of I&s;rael with upon their obedience. "Thou &s;hall lend unto many nations, and thou &s;hall not borrow. And the Lord &s;hall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou &s;hall be above only, and thou &s;hall not be beneath."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DEUT. xxviii. 12, 13.</NOTE> Plenty, wealth, dignity, liberty, all &s;eem to be compri&s;ed here.</P>
<P>When &s;uch is the &s;tate of a land, we may very properly adopt the language of David; having recounted &s;ome &s;ig|nal in&s;tances of GOD'S kindne&s;s, which he might apply to his own people, or however leave for general application. "Happy is that people that is in &s;uch a ca&s;e."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PSALM cxliv. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">5.</NOTE> Among the in&s;tances of happine&s;s that he mentions, is that of being free from the mole&s;tations of enemies, and &s;o of cour&s;e, en|joying internal peace and tranquility, be&s;ides enjoying di|vers other kinds of happine&s;s in connection with this, as noticed in the preceeding ver&s;es. And I cannot but add with the P&s;almi&s;t, "yea," or rather, "happy is that people who&s;e God is the Lord," who&s;e he is in a &s;pecial peculiar
<PB N="14" REF="014830_0012_0F978A03D1E43B10">
&s;en&s;e, a GOD in covenant, through JESUS CHRIST, the ble&s;&s;ed mediator. And now, notwith&s;tanding, as it has been ob|&s;erved, that vice, luxury, and all kinds of immoralities are wont to increa&s;e in proportion, as countries grow great and opulent, yet this cannot be the natural, unavoidable ten|dency of things; but mu&s;t be owing to a &s;trange infatua|tion in mankind, to a mo&s;t wretched perver&s;ion of the de|&s;igns of a good providence. The de&s;ign of GOD in all the in&s;tances of his goodne&s;s; public pro&s;perity and happine&s;s among the re&s;t, is to engage men to univer&s;al gratitude and obedience towards him. And being in &s;uch a happy, pro&s;|perous &s;tate, as we have mentioned, as they are under great obligations; &s;o, they are under great advantages for im|provement in religion: To attend upon the public duties and offices thereof, which are wi&s;ely de&s;igned and well a|dapted, and with a concurring divine ble&s;&s;ing, have often been &s;ucceeded to the effecting the purpo&s;es of real, vital piety and Godline&s;s; which &s;hould it generally prevail in a land, would be its greate&s;t glory, dignity, excellency, &s;afety and defence. If it was &s;aid of the renowned <HI>Elijah</HI> upon his tran&s;lation, that he was "the chariot of I&s;rael and the hor&s;emen thereof." What &s;hall be &s;aid of a land, what of its greatne&s;s, dignity and &s;afety, when there are great num|bers of his excellent &s;pirit and character? "Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation" more than any thing el&s;e, for it is the mo&s;t excellent thing, above gold, yea above fine gold. It is this that renders it peculiarly, yea mo&s;t eminently re|&s;pectable. One ob&s;erves upon the ca&s;e of <HI>Elijah,</HI> "that he was to that people, by his coun&s;els, reproofs and pray|ers, better than the &s;tronge&s;t force of chariots and hor&s;es, and kept off the judgments of GOD. His departure was like the routing of an army, an irreparable lo&s;s. Better have
<PB N="15" REF="014830_0013_0F978A055F15AC10">
lo&s;t all their men of war, than this man of GOD," How great now mu&s;t be the glory and &s;afety of a people, when there are many, many <HI>Elijahs</HI> among them? And I would ob&s;erve, that the outward peace, pro&s;perity and the flouri&s;h|ing of a people, affords &s;pecial opportunities and advantages for the forming men in general to the excellent character we have mentioned.</P>
<P>So that peace and tranquility in a land mu&s;t be con&s;id|ered as an ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing to it. Happy would it be was it to prevail among&s;t all mankind of every tongue, tribe and nation. But this cannot be expected &s;o long as the lu&s;ts of men, their pride, avarice, revenge, &amp;c. remain. Happy would it be were the&s;e de&s;troyed, and the kingdom of the prince of peace univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed in the earth.</P>
<P>WE may now go on to ob&s;erve, that war is a very great and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing calamity, and it is proportionally &s;o, accord|ing as the &s;eat of it is near or far off. It is when it is &s;ent into a land, greatly impoveri&s;hing to it, drains it of its &s;ub|&s;tance and occa&s;ions many &s;orrowful breaches in towns and families. Things are put out of cour&s;e, men's trade and commerce and various occupations greatly ob&s;tructed, their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, deriving from their indu&s;try and diligence, greatly failing, and &s;ometimes quite cut off, and they be|come reduced to great &s;traits and difficulties. Thus it is in a great many in&s;tances. We have &s;ufficient proof of this at the pre&s;ent day.&mdash;At be&s;t a variety of difficulties and hard&s;hips mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be undergone by a people, at a time when the &s;word of war is drawn upon them, and they are expo&s;ed to the deva&s;tations of it. This is a calamity that has been very common in the earth from age to age.
<PB N="16" REF="014830_0014_0F978A0613BD2960">
"Nation has lift up &s;word again&s;t nation." And what depopulation of countries, what &s;laughters and de&s;olations have been made in the earth? We may &s;ee the full proof of all this, if we only look into the antient &s;cripture-hi&s;tory. There has been the like proof of it in latter times, in our own, as well as in the times of our fathers.</P>
<P>As to internal peace and tranquility in our land, as I &s;aid before, no people on earth have been happier than we have, of a long &s;ea&s;on. Notwith&s;tanding frequent incur|&s;ions in former years of the &s;avages of the wilderne&s;s upon our expo&s;ed frontiers, yet no inva&s;ion of foreign powers up|on our &s;ea-coa&s;ts. Whatever, attempts there have &s;ome|times been of this &s;ort, yet through the good hand of our GOD towards us, they have proved abortive. We have been called to "&s;tand &s;till and &s;ee the &s;alvation of GOD.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was remarkably the ca&s;e in the year 1746, in the defeat of the powerful French Squadron, under the command of the Duke D'Anville. Mo&s;t fearful deva&s;tation would undoubtedly have been the con&s;equence, had he &s;ucceeded, e&s;pecially upon our &s;ea-coa&s;ts. But GOD "per&s;ecuted them with his tempe&s;t, and made them afraid with his &s;torm." "He &s;ent out his arrows and &s;cattered them, and &s;hot out lightnings and di&s;comfited them.

<P>BUT the time is come, when the &s;word of war is drawn upon us; not by foreign powers, but by our fellow-&s;ub|jects of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> with whom, we long maintained a friendly, brotherly corre&s;pondence, equally to their advan|tage as ours. And this would doubtle&s;s have continued

I would be far from tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon the rules of charity, but there is notwith&s;tanding clear light and evidence.</P>
<P>AND matters are now come to be very &s;erious indeed.&mdash;The conte&s;t it &s;eems, is not to be decided but at the point of the &s;word. This for &s;everal months has been drawn up|on us, and we have been pierced and wounded and greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by it. Our capital town has been taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of by Briti&s;h troops&mdash;from its being the grand re&s;ort of the country, the &s;eat of plenty, affluence and admini&s;tration of civil ju&s;tice&mdash;remarkable for its ob&s;ervation of the public duties and offices of religion, and particularly on the chri&s;|tian-&s;abbath, as I am thoroughly knowing to.&mdash;This, which has al&s;o been the city of our &s;olemnities, whither our tribes both of the civil and &s;acred order annually a&s;&s;embled to con|&s;ult and promote the good both of church and &s;tate. This &s;tately, elegant city is converted into a garri&s;on.

<P>IT may be further &s;aid with regard to that devoted City, that its harbour is crowded with powerful &s;hips of war.&mdash;Its trade, navigation and fi&s;hery wholly cut off. Military law e&s;tabli&s;hed in it. Its Churches broken up. Its inhabitants even the mo&s;t rich and opulent among them mo&s;tly gone off, leaving all their rich and valuable effects behind them, with but very little pro&s;pect of ever recovering them. Its poor that were publicly &s;upported, turned adrift into the wide world. And many that were comfortable to live, through their hone&s;t indu&s;try in their &s;everal occupations, now obliged to the public charity. And tho&s;e that remain, for the mo&s;t part, reduced to the greate&s;t &s;trait and wants, cut off from all tho&s;e &s;upplies that were wont to flow in to them, and out of the reach of their friends and brethren in the country, who have very &s;en&s;ibly felt for them, and would gladly have mini&s;tered to their nece&s;&s;ities, had it been at all practicable. But all communication being wholly &s;topt, they are in danger of peri&s;hing the en&s;uing winter, by hunger and cold.</P>
<P>THIS is a true picture of that once di&s;tingui&s;hedly happy town. Nor am I &s;en&s;ible of having at all heightned the co|lours

of it. Much of our blood has been &s;pilt in battles and &s;kirmi&s;hes. There have been divers captures of our ve&s;&s;els, with their valuable cargoes. And two of our large, flour|i&s;hing and wealthy towns,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CHARLESTOWN and FALMOUTH, in Ca&s;co-Bay. The inhabitants of the former, had for &s;ometime before de&s;erted it, and removed their mo&s;t va|luable effects; and &s;o were in no capacity at all of annoying the regular troops. Had they been in any danger from this quarter, e&s;pecially after they become ma&s;ters of Bunker-hill, they might have had &s;ome plau&s;ible pretence to lay it wa&s;te.&mdash;As to the latter, it is at a great di&s;tance from the &s;eat of action, and being without any fortification was not capable of mak|ing any defence. Nor was that place &s;pecially obnoxious. Some may call this true heori&s;m and general&s;hip; but all &s;ober, impartial per&s;ons, mu&s;t look upon the de&s;truction of both, as the effect of wantonne&s;s, not to &s;ay, cruelty and barbarity.</NOTE> wantonly laid in a&s;hes.

<P>BUT I would now go to ob&s;erve&mdash;That notwith&s;tanding &s;uch a di&s;mal &s;tate of things has taken place among us, yet we have abundant cau&s;e for prai&s;e and thankfulne&s;s to GOD that he has intermixed &s;o many mercies with this calamity, &s;o that our ca&s;e is not as yet come quite forlorn and de&s;perate, whatever it may be in time to come; yea, that we may en|tertain &s;ome hope, at lea&s;t, of being ere long delivered from this calamity, and of being again re&s;tored to peace and tranquility.</P>
<P>I have mentioned various favourable circum&s;tances with re&s;pect to other calamities we have been vi&s;ited with, the pe&s;|tilence
<PB N="20" REF="014830_0018_0F978A090F668910">
and drought. And many favourable ones have there been with re&s;pect to the war, in which we are unhappily involved.</P>
<P>THUS when they fir&s;t commenced it upon us at Lexing|ton and Concord, they found our people, contrary to expec|tation, brave and re&s;olute; and though few in number, in compare with them, yet they were repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s, and di&s;appointed of performing their enterpri&s;e. Their having thus waged war upon us,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If giving the fir&s;t fire determines the point of commencing war, abun|dant evidence has been exhibited both from the living and the dead, that they (near a 1000 in number) commenced it upon our little handful at Lexington. However, it has been ju&s;tly ob&s;eved&mdash;that "he that arms him&s;elf, to com|mit a robbery, and demands the traveller's pur&s;e, by the terror of in&s;tant death, is the fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;or, though the other &s;hould take the advantage of di&s;|charging his pi&s;tol fir&s;t and killing the robber."&mdash;Rev.

In con&s;e|quence of which, they were &s;oon &s;urrounded and hemmed in on every &s;ide, &s;o that they have been in a be&s;ieged &s;tate to this very day, and extremely drove, officers, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, as well as privates, not only with re&s;pect to the delicacies, but even the nece&s;&s;aries of life. Had they not been thus repul&s;ed and re&s;trained in the beginning, in all pro|bability great would have been the di&s;tre&s;s very &s;oon in the country towns. And this very town, it is with good rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed, was one object in view in the excur&s;ion they made. But "the &s;nare was broken, and we have e&s;caped. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who gave us not a prey to their teeth."</P>
<P>THE affair of Charle&s;town, though they took from us, &s;mall in number in compare with them (notwith&s;tanding a
<PB N="21" REF="014830_0019_0F978A0A09C1C998">
contrary repre&s;entation &s;ent home) though, I &s;ay, they took from us the ground and the works of a &s;ingle night, yet it was with amazing lo&s;s on their part, not only of privates, but of an uncommon proportion of officers, and &s;ome of them of principal rank.</P>
<P>OUR Lines and impregnable fortre&s;&s;es, are now extended all around our capital, which they have got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and every preparation made to repel them in ca&s;e of an attack. Had an attack been practicable, no doubt it would have been made before now. For it mu&s;t be very humiliating to <HI>Bri|tons</HI> who have been &s;o univer&s;ally (and I will add, in times pa&s;t, particular in the la&s;t war, among the nations in Europe, &s;o ju&s;tly) celebrated for their gallantry, to be under any re&s;traint from raw, undi&s;ciplined <HI>Americans,</HI> of who&s;e abili|ties they have been wont to entertain the mo&s;t contemptible idea, and upon whom they have been wont to be&s;tow the mo&s;t opprobious names.</P>
<P>IT may be added,&mdash;That GOD has rai&s;ed up able and experienced Generals, who have brought our army under a good regulation, and time has been given for their acquir|ing and becoming very expert in the military art; nor are they wanting in &s;trength and agility of body, nor in manly courage and fortitude. A remarkable &s;tate of health has prevailed in it. Notwith&s;tanding multitudes being vi&s;ited with the <HI>Dy&s;entry,</HI> yet few comparatively have been the in|&s;tances of mortality, not more perhaps, than if they had all tarried at home. A remarkable union and harmony has ran throughout the whole. An abundant &s;upply of the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upports and comforts of life, has all along been flowing in to them. Many of their ve&s;&s;els, with their rich freights, de&s;igned for our annoyance, and their &s;upport and
<PB N="22" REF="014830_0020_0F978A0A8D7B7638">
comfort have fallen into our hands.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not only many ve&s;&s;els of theirs, laden with the riche&s;t wines, meat, grain and vegetables, have from time to time fallen into our hands, and which they could but poorly &s;pare; but one, fraught with va&s;t military &s;tores, not ea&s;ily to be collected by us in our own land; a particular account of which has been publi&s;hed, and mo&s;t perhaps have &s;een.</NOTE> And by our various operations, they have been greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. And the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e has obliged us to di&s;tre&s;s them in all ways in our power.</P>
<P>To enfeeble, di&s;pirit and di&s;tre&s;s an enemy, from whom nothing could be expected but de&s;olation and ruin, without &s;ubmitting to abjectne&s;s of condition, mu&s;t be ju&s;tified upon the plaine&s;t principles of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>A remarkable and unexpected union has taken place, throughout all the colonies; and their &s;everal Delegates met in General Congre&s;s, who have had the direction of our military affairs, have di&s;covered a wonderful penetration, &s;agacity, wi&s;dom and &s;ore-ca&s;t in all matters at this critical juncture, big with the fate of America, and have rendered them&s;elves worthy of the public re&s;pect and gratitude.</P>
<P>I may add here as a favorable event in divine providence; that part of our forces have been led to penetrate the coun|try of Canada; that they have been put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal of their &s;trong and important fortre&s;&s;es, and that there is &s;o promi&s;ing a pro&s;pect of their becoming ma&s;ters of the whole country.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ticonderoga and Crown-Point, they &s;oon became ma&s;ters of with but little oppo&s;ition. The Forts of Chamblee and St. John's, after a &s;hort &s;iege &s;urrendered. And pre&s;ently, Montreal. They have very lately met with a repul&s;e at Quebec. Herein they have met with but the fortune of war, but they &s;till hope to carry their point there.</NOTE> An important affair this&mdash;as part of the
<PB N="23" REF="014830_0021_0F978A0DAC8D3660">
plan for &s;ubduing us, it appears probable from various cir|cum&s;tances, was to let loo&s;e the <HI>Canadians</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> to act over upon our new &s;ettlements, and &s;o gradually along from one &s;tage to another, the &s;ame bloody tragedy that they were wont formerly to do: So placing us, as it were between two fires, from the one or the other of which rendering our de&s;truction unavoidable. But this plan, by our operations in the country of <HI>Canada,</HI> bids fair, according to human pro|&s;pect to be defeated, and e&s;pecially as the inhabitants thereof very generally manife&s;t a friendly di&s;po&s;ition towards our people, and are ready to afford them all nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies.</P>
<P>So that from the various favorable events in the cour&s;e of GOD'S providence in this day of war and great calamity, we are furni&s;hed with abundant matter of prai&s;e and thankful|ne&s;s to his great name. It appears that though he is cha&s;|ti&s;ing and correcting us, yet that he hath not wholly ca&s;t off his people, neither hath for&s;aken his inheritance. And we may even now adopt the grateful language of the redeemed Captives from BABYLON. "The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PSALM cxxvi. 3.</NOTE> Upon a &s;urvey of his goodne&s;s in the many important in&s;tances of it, "his prai&s;e &s;hould be <HI>continually</HI> in our mouths."</P>
<P>HOWEVER, though GOD has manife&s;ted his goodne&s;s towards us in this day of evil, in the manner that has been &s;aid, yet we may not "boa&s;t as though we had put off the harne&s;s." This we have but ju&s;t "girded on." We may not expect any thing properly miraculous in the cour&s;e of GOD'S providence towards us, but mu&s;t look to the &s;tated cour&s;e of it. In his governing providence, he is wont to make u&s;e of means and in&s;truments, which are adapted to &s;uch and &s;uch ends. Such and &s;uch cau&s;es are wont to produce their
<PB N="24" REF="014830_0022_0F978A0F47E80470">
corre&s;pondent effects: Though it is true, that he can, if in his wi&s;dom he &s;ees fit, &s;u&s;pend the influence of natural cau&s;es. But we may in no ca&s;e of a certainty, depend upon it, that he will do &s;o.</P>
<P>IT appears, that on the other &s;ide the water, no concilia|tory mea&s;ures have been adopted, nor like to be &s;o. Indeed GOD has the hearts of all men in his hands, even of Kings and the great ones of the earth, and it is ea&s;y with him to turn their hearts towards us. But what lengths it may plea&s;e him the holy and righteous governor of the world, to permit them to go, and how far he may &s;ee fit further to cha&s;ti&s;e and puni&s;h us through their in&s;trumentality, we cannot tell. Con|&s;idering our multiplied and aggravated iniquities again&s;t him as a people, who have been &s;o highly favoured and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by him, lifted up to heaven in regard of privileges, civil and &s;acred&mdash;Con&s;idering our ba&s;ene&s;s and ingratitude, for his abundant goodne&s;s and loving-kindne&s;s, may not our fle&s;h tremble for fear of him, and we be afraid, of his judg|ments, &s;uch as &s;hall be totally ruining and de&s;troying, which we mu&s;t acknowledge we have ju&s;tly expo&s;ed our&s;elves to? GOD has many ways in which he can de&s;troy a people. In|deed whenever he &s;ees fit, he can do &s;o, by an immediate act of his almighty power. But he is wont to make u&s;e of in|&s;truments, and &s;ometimes that of the &s;word. This, as we have before ob&s;erved, he has permitted our brethren in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> to draw upon us. It is va&s;tly unhappy, it cannot be too much lamented, that we are thus at odds, with a peo|ple and nation, that we have been &s;o nearly connected with, who have been above all other nations dear to us, being "bone of our bone, and fle&s;h of our fle&s;h."&mdash;Her glory has been great and we have greatly rejoiced in it. Her moral &s;tate indeed has been very &s;ad. It is no unju&s;t reflec|tion upon her to &s;ay this. May not the holy GOD complain
<PB N="25" REF="014830_0023_0F978A10A5A43EE8">
over her, as he did over his antient profe&s;&s;ing people, "Ah &s;inful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a &s;eed of evil|doers, children that are corrupters"?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah i. 4.</NOTE> What a prevalence of Dei&s;m and infidelity, prophanene&s;s and immorality, di&s;&s;ipa|tion, luxury, venality and corruption? This wretched, cor|rupt &s;tate has long been complained of, with re&s;pect to that highly di&s;tingui&s;hed nation, which has hereby ju&s;tly expo&s;ed it&s;elf to exterminating judgments. Did that "righteou&s;ne&s;s by which a nation, is exalted," generally prevail in it, &s;uch a conte&s;t with the colonies, and the calamities con&s;equent up|on it, it is probable, would not have taken place. And the unnatural, ho&s;tile, bloody treatment of them at this day, may be looked upon, not as one of the lea&s;t of the heinous abominations &s;he &s;tands chargeable with in the &s;ight of Heaven.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the agency of GOD in calamitous events, &s;uch particularly, as he has brought upon us, and the great and important ends he may have in view, yet the in|&s;truments employed by him (intelligent, voluntary ones I mean) may be actuated from very bad motives and princi|ples, and may have it in their view to an&s;wer very bad ends. And thererefore, they are highly culpable in the &s;ight of GOD. Thus it was as to Jo&s;eph's brethren in their unnatural treat|ment of him, of which we read in the book of Gene&s;is.&mdash;They meant what they did unto him "for evil," and they were thoroughly convinced of this in proce&s;s of time, and led in the angui&s;h and bitterne&s;s of their hearts to acknowledge it. "GOD meant all for good," as the event abundantly made evident. But this was no excu&s;e for their ba&s;e conduct towards their own natural brother.</P>
<P>THE unnatural treatment we have met with from our bre|thren of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> is unju&s;tifiable in them and very
<PB N="26" REF="014830_0024_0F978A1156CA6960">
culpable, whatever may be &s;aid of the &s;uperintending provi|dence of GOD, and the great and wi&s;e ends he propo&s;es to an&s;wer upon the whole. May a gracious GOD reform all her national errors and vices, and make her "a holy nation, a peculiar people" to him&s;elf; and mercifully prepare the way for an happy, la&s;ting and honourable accommodation to take place between them and us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">War, it has been ob&s;erved in this di&s;cour&s;e is a fore calamity. No one acting upon the principles of chri&s;tianity, which, like its author, breathes nothing but peace and good will to men; or even upon the principles of common humanity, can "delight in it." Lucrative commi&s;&s;ions, high dig|nities and honours will weigh nothing again&s;t the&s;e principles duly exerci&s;ed. Thus far we may freely &s;ay, as to the Americans, that they do not engage in the pre&s;ent war of choice and with delight. They regret the &s;hedding a drop of Briti&s;h blood.&mdash;They are not di&s;po&s;ed to lavi&s;h away their OWN blood and trea&s;ure, merely for the &s;ake of doing &s;o. They are not chargeable with &s;uch wretched ab&s;urdity as this. Nothing but the great law of &s;elf-pre&s;er|vation, which is paramount to all the laws of civil e&s;tabli&s;hments, puts them upon drawing the &s;word. They would have rejoiced to have continued in harmony with the parent &s;tate and they earne&s;tly wi&s;h the re&s;toration of that harmony. The very idea of rebellion again&s;t their &s;overeign is abhorrent to them.&mdash;When a rebellion actually exi&s;ted in North-Britain, in 1746, level|led directly again&s;t the crown and dignity of his late Maje&s;ty George II. of glorious memory, by attempting to introduce the pretender to the throne, his loyal &s;ubjects in America, were univer&s;ally fired with a ju&s;t indignation at the daring attempt. They &s;tood ready to &s;acrifice their lives and fortunes in &s;upport of their &s;overeign. They rejoiced when that unnatural rebellion was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed under the victorious arms of his royal Highne&s;s WILLIAM, Duke of Cumberland. They kept days of public Thank&s;giving to ac|knowledge the great goodne&s;s of GOD in interpo&s;ing in that affair. And they ever remained his dutiful and loyal Subjects afterwards. At his decea&s;e, they te&s;tified their lamentations in every public way,&mdash;and then heartily transferred their fealty and allegiance to their new Sovereign, his royal Suc|ce&s;&s;or George the Third. All joined to hail his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne of his royal ance&s;tors, and to &s;ay "Let the King live for ever." And as they have never been di&s;po&s;ed to &s;trike at his crown and dignity, but agreable to the in&s;pired direction, to "<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">" him, &s;o they cannot but be deeply affected that they lie under his frowns. They de&s;ire nothing more, than to enjoy fully and unimpairedly the benefits of that excellent civil con&s;titution, at which he is placed at the head by the providence of the great &s;overeign of the world, and that in order to its full &s;upport and e&s;tabli&s;hment, and that they enjoy inviolate, tho&s;e charter-rights and privileges, which were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to them by the royal faith of the illu&s;trious William and Mary. They have been happy, and rejoiced in their happine&s;s, in being connected with Great-Britain.

In this view of the ca&s;e they de&s;ire to leave their cau&s;e with that GOD, who judgeth righteou&s;ly They therefore cannot with any ju&s;tice to them&s;elves, yield to the charge of rebellion, and look upon them&s;elves as greatly injured in being treated as though they were actually engaged in one.</NOTE> However, I would

Hitherto, many have been the favorable events of GOD'S providence, as we have particularly mentioned them at this time. So that without being over anxious as to futurity, we have great cau&s;e for thankfulne&s;s and prai&s;e to GOD.

his judgments; devoting our&s;elves to his &s;ervice and glo|ry; looking to him, that for the &s;ake of his &s;on Je&s;us, all pa&s;t di&s;obedience may be forgiven, and that he would vouch&s;afe the vital influences of his ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit to enable us to a hearty return to him, and to the love and practice of all that duty and &s;ervice which he requires and expects from us.&mdash;This would be to prai&s;e GOD in the mo&s;t genuine, &s;ub&s;tantial manner; and this would be an acceptable &s;acrifice to him through Je&s;us Chri&s;t: And if we and this whole people could be brought to this, we might then &s;afely leave our&s;elves with GOD, commit our cau&s;e to him, nothing doubting but that he would plead and maintain it. If we are on GOD'S &s;ide, we may then depend upon it, that he will be on ours, and then more is with us and for us, than can be again&s;t us. We need not then fear, but that he would be with us, as he was with our fathers, (and he was with them many a time, in their greate&s;t &s;traits and exigencies, &s;uch was their faith and prayer and en|gagedne&s;s in his &s;ervice) and never leave us nor for&s;ake us. And we might then take the comfort of that word with which I clo&s;e the di&s;cour&s;e,&mdash;P&s;alm 50, la&s;t ver&s;e, <HI>Who&s;e offereth prai&s;e, glorifieth me, and to him that ordereth his conver&s;ation aright will I &s;hew the &s;alvation of GOD.</HI></P>
