<HEAD>A LETTER From the Reverend Mr. WHITEFIELD, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Brethren in Chri&s;t,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> Chap. x. 23. Exhorts them <HI>to hold fa&s;t the Profe&s;&s;ion of their Faith without wavering;</HI> and im|mediately adds, as a mo&s;t effectual means for pro|ducing &s;o de&s;irable an end, <HI>Let us con&s;ider one ano|ther, to provoke unto Love and good Works, not for|&s;aking the A&s;&s;embling of our&s;elves together.</HI></P>
<P>As Chri&s;tianity was not then the National Religion, I &s;uppo&s;e by A&s;&s;embling them&s;elves together, the Apo&s;tle does not under&s;tand open A&s;&s;emblies, &s;uch as our publick Congregations, but rather little and private Societies, as was the Cu&s;tom of the Primi|tive Chri&s;tians, who we are told <HI>continued in Fel|low&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>This was the Apo&s;tle's Exhortation to the Chri&s;tians of tho&s;e Times, and I am fully per&s;waded there was never more occa&s;ion for renewing it than in the Age wherein we live: For nothing has of late more alarmed the Enemies of the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, than the Zeal which God has &s;tirred up in the Hearts of many, to put in Practice this Apo&s;tolical Injunction.&mdash;Balls, Plays, Hor&s;e-Races and &s;uch
<PB N="4" REF="004455_0003_100DA076C8E18B58">
like Diabolical Entertainments are countenanced and &s;upported by publick Authority.</P>
<P>Few if any (publickly at lea&s;t) now dare to &s;peak, preach, or write for Suppre&s;&s;ing them &s;o explicitly as they ought. But if the Children of God meet, as they are required, to build up each other in their mo&s;t holy Faith, almo&s;t every one's Mouth is opened a|gain&s;t them. Nay (with grief, God is my Judge, I &s;peak it) even mo&s;t of our Ma&s;ters in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> who ought to be Patterns and Promoters of every good Word and Work, are not content with Counte|nancing the &s;inful Diver&s;ions and polite A&s;&s;emblies of the Age by their Pre&s;ence and Approbation, but are generally mo&s;t bitter in their Invectives again&s;t Religious Societies, continually crying them down (e&s;pecially if any life or divine Power appear a|mong&s;t them) as Schi&s;matical and Seditious, and as Meetings which have a tendency to weaken the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hed Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>For the&s;e, and many &s;uch like Rea&s;ons, as pre|&s;ent with you in Spirit, tho' ab&s;ent in Body, I thought it my Duty to put you in mind zealou&s;ly to per&s;i&s;t in Practi&s;ing the 'forementioned Injunction once de|livered to the Saints, and &s;o much the more as in all probability the Day of Per&s;ecution nearer and nearer approaches.</P>
<P>There has been a gathering, undoubtedly a winnowing Time will come.&mdash;God's Fan is already in his Hand, yet a little while, and if the Work lately begun be carried on, I am per&s;uaded he will thoroughly purge his Floor. The Shepherds fir&s;t mu&s;t be &s;mitten; next endeavours exerted to &s;catter the Sheep. The Religious Societies, Satan no

doubt has de&s;ired to have, that he may &s;ift them as Wheat. <HI>My Brethren,</HI> Watch and Pray, that you may be counted worthy to &s;tand in &s;uch an Hour of Temptation.</P>
<P>Religious Society is of a Divine Extraction. As God fir&s;t made Man, &s;o God fir&s;t &s;aid, <HI>It is not good that Man &s;hould be alone,</HI> I <HI>will make a help meet for him.</HI>&mdash;Meet, as I take it, not meerly for his Body (Man had but few Corporal wants in Paradi&s;e) but chiefly and primarily for his better Part, the Soul, viz. <HI>that he might have one to conver&s;e with of his own Species, Bone of his Bone and Fle&s;h of his Fle&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>It's true, Man is now a fallen, but yet a &s;ocial Creature. And as the End of his coming into this World, was to prepare him&s;elf for a better, &s;o with|out doubt the chief End of Society in general, and Religious Society in particular is, that we may be helps meet for each other, in the great Work of our Salvation.</P>
<P>Upon this account, the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians &s;o frequently A&s;&s;embled them&s;elves together, tho' oblig'd to &s;hut the Doors for fear of the <HI>Jews.</HI> And their conti|nuing in Fellow&s;hip with each other, was one main Rea&s;on why they continued &s;teadfa&s;t in the Apo&s;tles Doctrine.&mdash;No doubt they went up to the Tem|ple at the Hour of Prayer, whil&s;t the Temple &s;tood, but then they thought that no excu&s;e for their meeting from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e to edify each other in Love.</P>
<P>The Societies of which you are Members, I hope, are of this Nature. Take then, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> the
<PB N="6" REF="004455_0005_100DA07AE13910E0">
Primitive Chri&s;tians for your En&s;amples. Their Practices were Recorded for our Learning. No Power on Earth can lawfully di&s;anul or prevent out imitating them.&mdash;In all &s;uch Ca&s;es we mu&s;t obey God rather than Man. Otherwi&s;e we &s;o far deny our holy Profe&s;&s;ion, and are Enemies to the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and tho' becau&s;e you are got a little out of the u&s;ual formal way, &s;ome blind Zealots may brand you as Schi&s;matical and Seditious, yet if you fear God, truly Honour the King, and are of the Number of tho&s;e who are quiet in the Land, there's no one Rea&s;on can be urged again&s;t your Societies, which will not equally hold good again&s;t all the Societies in the two great Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>In this Re&s;pect a private Prelate has no more Authority than a private Presbyter. If it be lawful for more than five to meet in a private Ve&s;try, it is equally lawful to meet in a private Hou&s;e, as is the Practice of &s;ome of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e Societies who are under the Government of the Twelve Stewards. If they ask you by what Authority you &s;ometimes u&s;e Extempore free Prayer? You may ask them again, by what Authority they u&s;e the Church forms any where but in the Church? If they reply they u&s;e Dr. <HI>Woodward'</HI>s Form. You may an&s;wer them with this Que&s;tion, what difference is there between a Per&s;ons reading a Form which few knew before they heard it, or a Per&s;ons praying Extempore as the Holy Spirit give him utterance? If they laugh at all Preten&s;ions o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Praying by the Spirit, Brethren, I hope you know better. Stand fa&s;t therefore in the Liberty where with Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath made you free. The Church of <HI>England</HI> confines none to forms but in the Hou&s;e of God. In private A&s;&s;emblies, &s;uch as yours, all are le&s;t to their Liberty. Whoever make it their
<PB N="7" REF="004455_0006_100DA07D49339F10">
Bu&s;ine&s;s to prevent you, di&s;cover a Spirit too like the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> of old. They are Strangers to the Liberties of the Go&s;pel them&s;elves, and tho&s;e that are Partakers of them they hinder.</P>
<P>Many trifling Objections were made again&s;t your Conduct in this particular when I was la&s;t in <HI>England.</HI> But they were generally urged with &s;o much Bigotry and Pa&s;&s;ion, and were &s;o weak in them&s;elves, that I &s;eldom thought they de&s;erved an An&s;wer. I com|monly &s;hewed my contempt of them by &s;aying no|thing at all about them.</P>
<P>But I tru&s;t, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> you have not built your Hou&s;e upon &s;o Sandy a Foundation, as to &s;uffer it to be thrown down by a few high &s;welling Words of Vanity. I am per&s;uaded you think it meet, right, and your bounden Duty, not only to A&s;&s;emble your|&s;elves together, but al&s;o to make u&s;e of your Chri&s;|tian freedom, and not again to be entangled in a Yoak of Bondage, for God hath called you to Liberty.</P>
<P>How to improve your Meetings &s;o as be&s;t to pro|mote God's Glory and the Good of your own Souls, ought to be your con&s;tant and chief Concern. For as Chri&s;tians in general, &s;o Members of Religious Societies in particular, are as Cities built upon a Hill, and therefore it more highly Concerns them, <HI>&s;o to let their Light &s;hine before Men, that they &s;eeing their Good Works, may glorify our Father which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Not that a perfect Communion of Saints is to be expected here on Earth; or that you ought to be immediately offended, if &s;ome of your Brethren
<PB N="8" REF="004455_0007_100DA080609C1948">
&s;hould be over taken with a fault. In this World Tares will be always Springing up among&s;t the Wheat. Many that are fir&s;t will be la&s;t and the la&s;t fir&s;t. Nay it is well, if &s;ome, <HI>Judas</HI> like, do not at length lay a&s;ide their Profe&s;&s;ion and openly betray their Ma&s;ter. In all &s;uch Ca&s;es, every one that &s;tandeth &s;hould take heed lo&s;t he fall, be ex|ceeding jealous of his own Heart, and not &s;ay, <HI>Lord is it my Brother;</HI> but, <HI>is it I that &s;hall deny thee next.</HI></P>
<P>To prevent &s;uch fatal mi&s;carriages, you ought to be very Cautious, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> whom you admit into Fellow&s;hip with you.&mdash;Examine them again and again whether they be in the Faith. Set them upon proving their own&s;elves, and by no Means re|ceive them into your Brotherhood, unle&s;s they can produce &s;ufficient Proofs of their having ta&s;ted the good Word of Life, and felt the Powers of the World to come in a &s;pecial and &s;aving Manner. This &s;ome may object is not a very good way to en|crea&s;e and multiply you as to Number: But it is the be&s;t way my Brethren, to encrea&s;e Piety among&s;t tho&s;e that you have. And a Society con&s;i&s;ting of a few &s;olid Chri&s;tians, is far preferable to one that is filled with a great Number of &s;uch who do not <HI>bring forth Fruit unto Holine&s;s, but have only the Fig-leaves of an outward Profe&s;&s;ion.</HI> Formal Hypo|crites will do you more harm than good; and how|ever they may endure for a while and receive the Word with Joy, yet having no Root in them&s;elves, in time of Temptation they will &s;hamefully fall a|way.&mdash;<HI>From all &s;uch, Good Lord, deliver thy Church.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004455_0008_100DA08283F3B030">
Next to your Care about admitting others, I think it highly concerns you whenever you do a&s;&s;emble, to remember the End of your Meeting, and then to u&s;e the Words of the wi&s;e Son of <HI>Sirach,</HI> on another Occa&s;ion, you will never do ami&s;s. Now the End of your Meetings, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> is not that you may think your&s;elves more Holy than your Neigh|bours, much le&s;s to form a Party, or promote a Schi&s;m or Sedition in the Church or State. No! &s;uch Thoughts I tru&s;t are far from you: For they are Earthly, Sen&s;ual, Devili&s;h! And if ever any &s;uch De&s;igns &s;hould be &s;et on foot, I earne&s;tly pray God, the Abettors of them may be immediately detected, and all their Schemes, tho' ever &s;o plau&s;ibly concerted, fall to the Ground. The only End I hope you all propo&s;e by your Religious A&s;&s;emblies, is the &s;ame for which you were Created, viz. <HI>The renewing of your depraved Natures and promoting the hidden Life of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in your Souls.</HI> The&s;e Terms howe|ver they may &s;eem fooli&s;hne&s;s to others, I tru&s;t, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> are not &s;o to you.&mdash;I take it for granted, you not only are de&s;irous of, but already, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, are ble&s;&s;ed with a &s;aving, experimental Knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in your Hearts. For un|le&s;s a Man be born again from above and is made a partaker of the Indwelling of God's Holy Spirit, he &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter into the Kingdom of God.&mdash;Whoever denies this to be true in the mo&s;t literal, real, and ab&s;olute Sen&s;e of the Words, knows no|thing yet as he ought to know.&mdash;For it is grounded on a &s;elf-evident Truth, viz. <HI>That we are all fallen from God in</HI> Adam, <HI>and mu&s;t be renewed in the Spirit of our Minds, ere we can be re&s;tored to a bli&s;s|ful Communion with him again.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004455_0009_100DA085C915FD20">
The only way to this is <HI>Faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI>&mdash;Faith, in Contra-di&s;tinction to, tho' nece&s;&s;arily pro|ductive of Good Works. <HI>I am the Way, the Truth and the Life, Who&s;oever believeth on me, tho' he were dead</HI> (as we all are by Nature) <HI>yet &s;hall be live,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t him&s;elf.&mdash;And I think it my bounden Duty to exhort you to contend earne&s;tly for the Doctrine of Ju&s;tification by Faith alone, becau&s;e &s;o many blind Guides are lately gone out into the World.&mdash;It is much to be feared, that the gene|rality of our pre&s;ent Preachers are no better than Doctrinal Papi&s;ts.&mdash;And however this, to tho&s;e who having Eyes, &s;ee not, may be judged an un|charitable Cen&s;ure, yet &s;urely they cannot ju&s;tly blame me for want of Candour, if they con&s;ider how one of the mo&s;t Orthodox Prelates in the Kingdom in a late Pa&s;toral Letter, advi&s;es his Clergy <HI>&s;o to ex|plain the Doctrine of Ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God, by Faith alone, as to make Good Works a nece&s;&s;ary Condition of our Ju&s;tification.</HI> Such Advice from a <HI>Roman Cardinal</HI> would be no more than we might expect, but coming from a Bi&s;hop of the <HI>Church of England</HI> is &s;urprizing and much to be la|mented.!</P>
<P>God forbid, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> that you &s;hould &s;o learn Chri&s;t.&mdash;If the Scriptures be true, &s;uch Doctrine is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e. The lively Oracles of God no where declare, <HI>Good Works to be a nece&s;&s;ary Condition of our Ju&s;tification in the Sight of God.</HI> On the contrary, they every where affirm, <HI>that Salvation is the free Gift of God, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI>&mdash;<HI>that we are &s;aved by Grace thro' Faith</HI>&mdash;<HI>that it is not of Works, le&s;t any Man &s;hould Boa&s;t.</HI>&mdash;No! <HI>my Brethren,</HI> in the great Scheme of Mans Salva|tion by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Boa&s;ting is entirely excluded.
<PB N="11" REF="004455_0010_100DA08818E7CB20">
We mu&s;t not expect to be &s;aved, or any ways to re|commend our&s;elves to God's Favour, by any or all the Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done, or &s;hall, or can do.&mdash;<HI>The Lord Chri&s;t is our Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s</HI>&mdash;His mu&s;t be imputed to us in&s;tead of our own.&mdash;<HI>We are compleat in him,</HI> &s;ays the Scripture&mdash;<HI>We are accounted Righteous before God, only for the Merit of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t by Faith,</HI> &s;ays the Eleventh Article of our Church.

If this was to be the Ca&s;e, no Man living ever was or ever will be Ju&s;tified in the Sight of God.&mdash;The Law indeed &s;ays, <HI>Do and Live.</HI>&mdash;But the Go&s;pel brings us the Glad Tydings, <HI>that Chri&s;t is the End of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that be|lieveth.</HI>&mdash;Chri&s;t by his Obedience has every Way fulfilled the Law for us,&mdash;and God will not de&s;ire to be paid twice.&mdash;Chri&s;t bought our Ju&s;tification.

<P><HI>Ob&s;erve my Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By or through, and not for Faith.&mdash;For Faith is only the Mean or In&s;trument whereby the whole Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is apply'd to the Sinners Soul. And who&s;oever does thus believe in their <HI>Hearts,</HI> may be a&s;&s;ured their Pardon is &s;ealed in Heaven, notwith&s;tanding they may have lived in an open Breach of God's Commandments all the Time

before their Conviction. <HI>Believe,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle to the trembling Jaylor, <HI>and thou &s;halt be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>Not that this Faith if True will be Dead, Idle or Inactive.&mdash;For it is not a Faith of the Head <Q>An a&s;&s;enting to things Credible as Credible, as 'tis commonly defined.</Q> The Devils thus Believe and Tremble.&mdash;But it is a Faith of the <HI>Heart,</HI> a living Principle wrought in the Soul by the Spirit of God, applying that inwardly which was wrought out for him outwardly by Je&s;us Chri&s;t upon the Cro&s;s, and continually exciting the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it, <HI>to &s;how it forth by his Works,</HI> not as nece&s;&s;ary Conditions of his Ju&s;tification, but as Proofs of his having a living Faith, and as &s;o many tokens of his Gratitude and Love for what God has done for his Soul. This is what the Apo&s;tle &s;tiles <HI>a Faith working by Love.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot conclude this better than in the Words of a truly Evangelical Writer now by me.&mdash;<HI>The Law</HI> (&s;aye&s;t thou) <HI>mu&s;t be obeyed. I an&s;wer, Chri&s;t Je&s;us hath done that in his own Per&s;on, and Ju&s;tified me thereby; and for my own part, I will not labour now to fulfil the Law for Ju&s;tification, le&s;t I &s;hould undervalue the Merits of the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and what he hath done without me; and yet will I labour to fulfil, if it were po&s;&s;ible, ten thou&s;and Laws, if there were &s;o many: And Oh! let it be out of Love to my &s;weet Lord Je&s;us</HI>&mdash;<HI>For the Love of Chri&s;t con&s;trains me.</HI></P>

Oh that all that call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians were thus minded! How &s;hould we &s;ee the Kingdom of Chri&s;t come with Power, and Satan like Lightning fall from Heaven. From the beginning it has been his Poli|cy to divide Profe&s;&s;ors into Sects and Parties, hope|ing thereby not only to weaken their Intere&s;t, but to make them believe Religion wholly con&s;i&s;ted in being of this or that particular Communion.</P>

And his &s;erpentine Subtiety has &s;o prevailed that tho' we all profe&s;s to hold one Lord, one Faith, one Bapti&s;m, yet numbers look upon all that differ from them almo&s;t as Creatures of another Species, and forbid us with &s;uch even to Eat. This was once the State of the Jewi&s;h, as it is now of the Chri&s;tian Church, but God &s;hewed his di&s;like of &s;uch a Temper, by telling <HI>Peter</HI> in a miraculous Manner, <HI>That he was henceforward to call nothing that God had clean&s;ed common or unclean, but freely to conver&s;e with all who feared him and worked Righteou&s;ne&s;s for &s;uch were accepted of him.

How little Love or Power of Religion may be kept up by &s;uch a low &s;uperficial Way of proceed|ing, is not difficult to &s;uppo&s;e. <HI>My Brethren,</HI> do not you go on in &s;uch a Formal round of Duties, but frankly and freely tell one another what God has done for your Souls&mdash;For this End you would do well to form your&s;elves into little Bands, and without re&s;erve tell each other what is in your Hearts. None but tho&s;e that have Experience can tell the un&s;peakable Advantages of &s;uch an union of Souls&mdash;By this Means, brotherly Love will be excited and kept up among&s;t you; and you will learn to watch over one another for Good: This will teach you the better, how to pray for each other in your private retirements, and put off, if not totally pre|vent many Snares of the Devil: For Satan loves &s;olitary Virtue, but cares not to tempt him, who he knows will di&s;cover his Devices to his Bre|thren. Be&s;ides, this is a mo&s;t effectual Means for each to try the &s;incerity of his own Heart, as well as anothers. No one I think that truly loves his Soul and his Brethren will be &s;hy of opening his Heart, in order to have their Advice, Reproof, Ad|monition and Prayers as his Occa&s;ions require. A &s;in|cere Per&s;on will e&s;teem it one of the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings; nor do I know a better Means in the World to keep Hypocrites out from among you. <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> and <HI>Unbelievers</HI> will pray, read and &s;ing P&s;alms, but none &s;ave an <HI>I&s;realite</HI> indeed, will endure to have his Heart &s;earched. <HI>He that hath Ears to hear let him hear.</HI></P>

To be a true Chri&s;tian, is realy to be &s;can|dalous: If you were of the World, the World would love its own, but if you are not of the World, and are in the Number of tho&s;e whom Chri&s;t has cho|&s;en out of the World, <HI>My Brethren</HI> the World will hate you: However it may &s;eem a Paradox to the natural Man, yet there was never a true <HI>Saint</HI> who was not accounted a mad Per&s;on; and they that will live Godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us mu&s;t to the End of Time &s;uffer Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>But God forbid, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> that a little, nay that all the contempt in the World, &s;hould any Ways move you from your Profe&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel.

When you are reviled, revile not again, ble&s;s my <HI>Brethren</HI> but cur&s;e not, be true Followers of the meek and dear Lamb of God, never entertain the lea&s;t Thought of re&s;i&s;ting the higher Powers upon any pretence whatever: The Powers that be, are ordain'd of God; who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the Power; e&s;pecially becau&s;e he will not patiently &s;uffer

I be&s;eech you by the Mercies of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord, be|ware of all &s;uch who would turn Religion into a Party. O let me once more entreat you never &s;uffer any &s;uch thing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t among&s;t you, &s;hew that you truly fear God by paying all due honour, tribute and obedience to the King as Supreme, and to Governors, as to &s;uch who are &s;ent by him, remember again and a|gain that our Weapons are not Carnal&mdash;And that they who take the Sword &s;hall peri&s;h by the Sword.
