<P>AS what was &s;aid in public on the following &s;ubjects, was delivered. almo&s;t entirely extempore, the author finds it impo&s;&s;ible to give an exact copy. Tho&s;e things however, on account of which, he apprehends, a copy was de&s;ired, have been carefully pre&s;erved. The particular expre&s;&s;ions could not be recollected, but the ideas are not lo&s;t. Several new thoughts on the &s;ubject are inter&s;per&s;|ed.</P>
<P>THE author's general de&s;ign is to awaken in his coun|trymen, proper &s;entiments and emotions, re&s;pecting both ci|vil and &s;piritual liberty. The former, without the latter, is but a body without a &s;oul.&mdash;As the copy is &s;o &s;uddenly called for, the fir&s;t, rough draught, goes to the pre&s;s; and the author doubts not, but many imperfections will be ob&s;erv|ed in the &s;tile and manner; which however he tru&s;ts are le&s;s evils, than a delay at a time when every means, how|ever imperfect, is needful, that may in&s;pire a genuine &s;pi|rit of true liberty. He feels that he wants tho&s;e advan|tages which many others enjoy, for becoming entirely ac|quainted with the various branches of civil liberty.&mdash;The main ideas alone are attended to. The inqui&s;itive mind will be able to draw a number of important con&s;equences.</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>I. CORRINTH. Chap. VII. ver. 21.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Art thou called <HI>being</HI> a &s;ervant? Care not for it; but if thou maye&s;t be made free, u&s;e <HI>it</HI> rather.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AT fir&s;t glance, it is certain, this text refers to a &s;tate of <HI>per&s;onal</HI> &s;ervitude, and ex|tends to every in&s;tance of the &s;ame kind. It is al&s;o as clear that the Apo&s;tle exhorts the &s;ervant to prefer liberty. This proves that the in&s;pired writer him&s;elf, prefered liberty to a &s;tate of &s;ervitude; for he would not ex|hort another to prefer what was not preferable in his own e&s;teem. Now, if Paul e&s;teemed per|&s;onal liberty a valuable inheritance, he certain|ly e&s;teemed the liberty of a community a far richer inheritance; for if one man's enjoyment of it was a good, the enjoyment of two mu&s;t be a greater good, and &s;o on through the whole community. From the &s;ame manner of rea&s;oning, the &s;lavery of a community ap|pears
<PB N="6" REF="013502_0005_0F90A3C4D1124128">
to be a proportionably greater evil, than the &s;lavery of an individual. Hence, we may ob&s;erve from the text, that CIVIL LIBERTY IS A GREAT GOOD.</P>
<P>THIS is the propo&s;ition to which I a&s;k your pre&s;ent hour's attention, and if it &s;hould appear in the &s;equel to contain an important truth, you will not e&s;teem it below the go&s;pel preach|er's duty to explain and &s;upport it in public, e&s;pecially at &s;uch a time as this, a time, at the very pro&s;pect of which, our generous fore-fa|thers would have wept in bitterne&s;s of &s;oul. If civil liberty is a great good, it ought to be deemed one of the ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven; the&s;e it is the preacher's duty to illu&s;trate, that we may feel the obligations they bring us under &mdash;that we may enquire whether we have im|proved them for the glory of the giver, and that we may know how to conduct to|ward them for the future. Be plea&s;ed then to give your candid, clo&s;e, and &s;erious attention, while I endeavour to explain the nature of ci|vil liberty, and prove that it is a great good.</P>
<P>AS it is much le&s;s difficult to point out the nature of true coin in general, than to deter|mine whether any particular piece is genuine, or how far it differs from the perfect &s;tandard: So it is much ea&s;ier to point out the general nature of civil liberty, than to &s;ay what degree of it enters into any particular civil con&s;tituti|on.
<PB N="7" REF="013502_0006_0F90A3C62DB73770">
It is therefore mo&s;t natural to enquire, in the fir&s;t place, concerning the general na|ture of liberty; and indeed it is as nece&s;&s;ary as natural. For until we determine this que&s;|tion we have no rule by which we may e&s;ti|mate the quantity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> liberty in any particular con&s;titution: But when once we have found the &s;tandard, we &s;hall be prepared to examine our own con&s;titution, or any other, at plea&s;ure, and to determine what part of the con&s;titution &s;hould be &s;upported, and what may be given up with &s;afety. An enquiry into the nature of liberty in general, is al&s;o needful on ano|ther account. Without it we cannot &s;ee the force of any evidence that may be brought to evince the value of liberty it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THAT the &s;ubject may be fairly elucidated, I will endeavour to remove &s;ome mi&s;takes by which it has been ob&s;cured. In doing this, I ob&s;erve, that liberty does not con&s;i&s;t in per&s;ons thinking them&s;elves free. The Jews could &s;ay we were never in bondage to any man though they wore the Roman yoke at the ve|ry &s;ame time. Again, though a certain con&s;tituti|on &s;hould be contended for and &s;upported by a majority of voices; yet this would be no &s;ure evidence that it is free: Becau&s;e an hun|dred may as truly tyrannize over one, as one over an hundred; or otherwi&s;e, the majority may be in favour of licentiou&s;ne&s;s. What but a love of licentiou&s;ne&s;s or tyranny, or both,
<PB N="8" REF="013502_0007_0F90A3C6A54AC4A8">
can induce the heathen nations to approve of their &s;everal &s;y&s;tems of government? What but the&s;e, could induce Saul and the men of I&s;rael to per&s;ecute David and his hand|ful? What but one or both of the&s;e drew down the fury of Sodom on Lot&mdash;of the Jews on the prophets&mdash;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash; on his Apo&s;tles and their followers. What but the&s;e ever rai&s;ed any one of the many terrible per&s;ecutions under which the peaceable di&s;ci|ples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t have fallen from time to time? In all the&s;e in&s;tances the majority have been unfriendly to liberty.</P>
<P>CIVIL Liberty con&s;i&s;ts, not in any inclinati|ons of the members of a community; but in the being and due admini&s;tration of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of laws, as effectually tends to the great|e&s;t felicity of a &s;tate. Herein con&s;i&s;ts civil liber|ty, and to live under &s;uch a con&s;titution, &s;o admini&s;tered, is to be the member of a free &s;tate; and he who is free from the cen&s;ure of tho&s;e laws, may fully enjoy all the plea&s;ures of civil liberty, unle&s;s he is prevented by &s;ome defect, not in the con&s;titution, but in him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>IF liberty con&s;i&s;ts in the being and admini&s;|tration of a civil con&s;titution, different from &s;uch an one as has been mentioned, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, my inference from the Apo&s;tle's ex|hortation is not ju&s;t. For certain it is, that
<PB N="9" REF="013502_0008_0F90A3C769F5E5C8">
&s;o far as a con&s;titution doth not tend, in the highe&s;t degree, to the greate&s;t felicity of the &s;tate, collectively con&s;idered; it is a compari|tive evil and not a good.</P>
<P>WHERE there is no &s;y&s;tem of laws, not li|berty, but anarchy, takes place. Some de|gree of liberty may, indeed, exi&s;t where nei|ther the con&s;titution nor the admini&s;tration of it is perfect. But in order to perfect freedom, the law mu&s;t extend to every member of the community alike, both in its requi&s;itions and prohibitions. Every one mu&s;t be required to do all he can that tends to the highe&s;t good of the &s;tate For the whole of this is due to the &s;tate, from the individuals of which it is com|po&s;ed. Every thing, however trifling, that tends, even in the lowe&s;t degree, to di&s;&s;erve the intere&s;t of the &s;tate mu&s;t al&s;o be forbidden.</P>
<P>ORIGINALLY, there were no private inter|e&s;ts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>THE great God is the original owner of all things. He has, originally, no partner in any thing; but has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to invite his rational crea|tures, who are capable of enjoyment, to a joint parti|cipation of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, according to their various capacities. Thus, ant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cedent to the creation of this world, whatever exi&s;ted was a kind of common &s;tock enjoyed by God and tho&s;e of his creatures that could enjoy &s;uch a good. All were to exert them&s;elves to turn every thing to the be&s;t advantage, for the whole, and no one of all God's creatures, could call any thing his own, in di&s;tinction from others, except the plea&s;ure that re&s;ulted to him from the common good. There were no private intere&s;ts then. Afterwards, God made the world, and this became an addition to the com|mon &s;tock. The world it&s;elf, and all the creatures in it were enjoyed by God and his holy Angels. At length, Adam was formed out of the du&s;t of the earth. He was a new addition to the common &s;tock of wealth, and being made capable of enjoyment, was received as a member of the grand company, and be|came intere&s;ted in God, Angels, Heaven and Earth, and all things in them. This world, a particular por|tion of the common &s;tock, was committed, in certain re&s;pects, to him and his po&s;terity to be managed by them for the grand company. I &s;ay, in certain re&s;pects, for there are certain other re&s;pects in which it was not committed to them; in certain re&s;pects, God takes the care of it, in certain other re&s;pects, the Angels have the management of the world and all things in it. Each one has his particular department a&s;&s;igned to him, Adam and his po&s;terity are to be con&s;idered both as a part of the common intere&s;t, and as over&s;eers. They have nothing that they can call their own, to the exclu|&s;ion of the right, either of God or his Angels. Nor was there ever any thing in the world that any one could call his own, to the exclu&s;ion of his fellow men, <HI>i. e.</HI> in a &s;tate of nature. Antecedent to compact, any one of all the individuals, had as good a right to lay claim to the &s;ame inheritance as another. Nay, any one had as good a right to exclude the re&s;t from the enjoyment of every part of the whole, as from any, e|ven the lea&s;t part. Any one individual might mono|polize the whole earth by the &s;ame rule of ju&s;tice, by which he could monopolize a &s;ingle acre, or inch. So that antecedent to compact, there could not po&s;&s;ibly be any private intere&s;t whatever, and every ap|pearance of private intere&s;t was the effect of violent &s;eizure, and tenure, and not of ju&s;t di&s;tribution. No man has a right to enter on any common intere&s;t without the order of the proprietors.</P>
<P>THERE are two modes in which earthly &s;tates were originally formed. The one is, by the over grown influence of an individual, which put it into his pow|er to exerci&s;e an arbitrary government. The o|ther is by a compact formed with a particular de|&s;ign to &s;ecure and advance the private intere&s;ts of tho&s;e by whom the compact was made. Both of the&s;e had their ri&s;e in u&s;urpation. As to the fir&s;t there is no di&s;pute. As to the &s;econd it may be &s;aid, that there were no private intere&s;ts antecedent to compact, but &s;uch as had been taken by u&s;urpation. It is true, that &s;uch u&s;urpers may have appropriated &s;uch intere&s;ts as they called their own, without any re&s;i&s;tance; but this no more frees them from the charge of u&s;urpation, than it would a tyrant, for him to &s;ay that he had ob|tained a &s;tate of ab&s;olute monarchy gradually, and without re&s;i&s;tance. Stratagem, and the length of the &s;word are the only &s;tandards of right in either of the&s;e ca&s;es. The ab&s;olute monarch ju&s;tifies him&s;elf, by &s;ay|ing, that he had a majority of &s;trength in his favour, and the member of &s;uch an a&s;&s;ociation, as has been named, re&s;olved to enter on a combination, for the &s;ake of u&s;ing his &s;word in the be&s;t manner he could for the defence of what little he had, and con&s;ented that his neighbours &s;hould hold what they had appropriated, and determined not to attempt to dive&s;t them of the public intere&s;t they have &s;eized, lea&s;t in the &s;cuffle he &s;hould lo&s;e what he had as unju&s;tly monopolized. This is the maxim on which pirates and gangs of rob|bers live in a kind of unity. If we go on this maxim, if we &s;uppo&s;e that is a well founded government which has its foundation in private intere&s;t, we can by no means blame the tyrant for holding ab&s;olute domi|nion, without condemning our&s;elves; nor can the ty|rant blame his &s;ubjects for their rebellion, whenever they apprehend rebellion will be their greate&s;t emolu|ment. For, if government is fir&s;t founded on private intere&s;t, it cannot be rea&s;onab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> expected, that the &s;u|per&s;tructure will &s;tand, when the foundation is remov|ed. It matters not whether men who build their no|tions of government on &s;elf-intere&s;t, call them&s;elves whigs or tories, friends to prerogative, or to the liber|ties of the people. Their &s;cheme of government is the &s;ame for &s;ub&s;tance. They cannot blame their neighbour for commencing tory when it will be mo&s;t conducive to his private intere&s;t. Indeed, on this &s;cheme it is unrea&s;onable to with&s;tand a mob or a ty|rant, or to make war on the pirates them&s;elves, for, according to this doctrine they are none of them doing any thing but what is right. Yes, &s;ay you, they infringe on my rights. I a&s;k, what rights? None but &s;uch as you have pillaged from the com|munity&mdash;Rights in which the&s;e very per&s;ons are in|tere&s;ted as members of the community.</P>
<P>THE world and its inhabitants, are a common pro|perty that belongs to the whole intellectual &s;y&s;tem. They are committed to mankind to be managed for the whole. It is therefore the bu&s;ine&s;s of mankind collectively, to regulate and di&s;po&s;e of the inheritance for the emolument of the whole company. In order to this, government in its various parts is nece&s;&s;ary; and the &s;everal offices in the government become &s;o many parts of the common good, or &s;tock. The&s;e, as well as the other parts of the common inheritance, are to be committed to individuals by the body of &s;tewards, to be improved for the company of proprietors. Every individual is to have his part a&s;&s;igned him, and &s;o long as he fills his place well, he is to be rewarded for his &s;ervices by the community, that is, he is to have the enjoyment of &s;uch conveniences, in &s;uch a degree as &s;hall be a &s;ufficient recompence for his labour and care; but he is not to have any &s;eparate intere&s;t con|&s;igned to him, for this would tend to detach him from the community. Ju&s;t &s;o far as his affection is turned on private intere&s;t, he will become regardle&s;s of the common good, and when he is detached from the community in heart, his &s;ervices will be very precari|ous at be&s;t, and tho&s;e will not be expected at all which imply &s;elf denial. He is only to enjoy it at the will of the commuity, which is to be regulated by the intere&s;t of the whole.</P>
<P>SOME are to be rewarded for their &s;ervices to the community by an exchange of commodities. Carri|ers, &s;uch as merchants are, are to have a certain pro|portion of the commodities they carry. Others are to be rewarded by a general collection from the whole. Thus each individual is to take care of the community, and the community in its turn, is to make pro|vi&s;ion for the individuals.&mdash;The&s;e ob&s;ervations afford us a clue to the relation that kingdoms and &s;tates, and the internal part of individual &s;tates, bear to each other. The whole world is properly, no more than a &s;mall colony of the univer&s;e. But &s;mall as it is it is too unweildy to be managed as one &s;tate, by rea|&s;on of the feeblene&s;s of human powers. There is therefore a propriety in its being &s;ubdivided into &s;till &s;maller portions called kingdoms. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e &s;till to regard the good of the world, in &s;ub&s;ervi|ency to the good of the univer&s;e. Neighbouring &s;tates have no more right to ri&s;e up again&s;t each other, than neighbouring individuals. Different &s;tates are inter|e&s;ted in the welfare of each other and ought to &s;eek the good of each other. One has no right to devi&s;e &s;chemes to enrich it&s;elf by impoveri&s;hing another. The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with re&s;pect to different parts of the &s;ame kingdom.</P>
<P>THIS is a &s;cheme of government perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the divine government, and true rea&s;on. And on this &s;cheme we may con&s;i&s;tently exert our&s;elves in fa|vour of liberty, and puni&s;h tyrants according to their ju&s;t de&s;erts.</P>
<P>THERE is much &s;aid about the prerogative of crowns. Crowned heads have indeed a prerogative of doing good, but no prerogative for any private emolu|ment. The true honour of a King con&s;i&s;ts in his do|ing good; but if he becomes an ob&s;tacle in the way of public good, he is to be removed like other common nui&s;ances.</P>
<P>THIS &s;cheme &s;hews us, likewi&s;e, on what principles we are to &s;tand ready to lay down our lives in the cau&s;e of liberty, or, which is the &s;ame thing, in vindication of good government. We, and all we have, belong to the communitity. Whenever therefore the common cau&s;e requires it, we &s;hould, like Paul, be ready to lay down our lives for the brethren. It is but what we owe to the community.</P>
<P>OUR worthy forefathers, however they might great|ly err in &s;ome particular in&s;tances, &s;eem to have been in&s;pired by this generous &s;cheme of liberty. This was what led them to this new world, and I would hope that we their po&s;terity have too much of that &s;pirit which led them to ri&s;que their lives, to &s;uffer our&s;elves to be en&s;laved by an India herb, or Engli&s;h manufac|tures.</P></NOTE>.

be qualified to u&s;e them for the good of the whole. In this way every member becomes a &s;ervant to the &s;tate, and is a good or bad &s;er|vant according to the manner in which he di&s;charges the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him. This is equally true of the King on the throne and the pea&s;ant in the field. The laws of a free &s;tate require each individual to u&s;e the public in|tere&s;ts depo&s;ited in his hands, in every in&s;tance
<PB N="16" REF="013502_0015_0F90A3CEDFF5C340">
in that very manner that &s;hall contribute mo&s;t to the good of the community, without any particular reference to Governor or &s;ubject, rich or poor, high or low. While the laws require &s;uch a continual cour&s;e of conduct in every member of the commu|nity, they as critically forbid every one to take from another that part of the public property which is committed to him; or to impede him in making the be&s;t u&s;e of it for the pub|lic, unle&s;s when the community &s;ee it be&s;t to deprive an individual of his place, and autho|ri&s;e another to do it in their name. In this manner the laws of a free &s;tate provide &s;ecuri|ty for the particular properties of each indivi|dual member, or rather for the public intere&s;t depo&s;ited in the hands of individuals, by de|nouncing &s;uch penalties on every offender as are exactly adequate to his offence. There mu&s;t be an exact proportion between the of|fence and the penalty. Where there is no &s;uch proportion, or equality, liberty is infring|ed, becau&s;e the law is partial, as it will injure, either the public, by not giving it its due, or the offender, by inflicting a greater evil than he de&s;erves. In this ca&s;e there mu&s;t be no di&s;|tinctions, made by the law, between per&s;ons of different characters and &s;tations, only as tho&s;e different characters and &s;tations may give the &s;ame criminal action different degrees of aggra|vation. A criminal action is more criminal in a per&s;on who fills an elevated place, than in one
<PB N="17" REF="013502_0016_0F90A3D055CB8B48">
of a more humble condition; becau&s;e it has a more detrimental a&s;pect on the &s;tate. For this rea&s;on, the offences of the great &s;hould be puni&s;hed with greater indignity and &s;everity, than the crimes of per&s;ons in low life. In a perfectly free &s;tate, friend&s;hip to the commu|nity will be as carefully noticed as an offence. Puni&s;hment will not be more exactly alloted to the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, than adequate rewards to the faithful &s;ubject. The farmer, the &s;eaman, the mechanic, the merchant, and the practi|tioner of &s;uch of the learned profe&s;&s;ions as be|long to the &s;tate, are directed by the commu|nity, in effect, to reward each other by an ex|change of labour, or commodities. While tho&s;e &s;ervants of the &s;tate, who are employed in manag|ing the reins of government, are rewarded by a collection from the whole, an equality to which, is returned in the happy effects of legi&s;|lation and executive ju&s;tice.

<P>A GOOD foundation for liberty is laid in &s;uch a con&s;titution, but its whole worth lies in due admini&s;tration. Perfect liberty takes place where &s;uch a con&s;titution is fully admini&s;tred: But where the admini&s;tration is imperfect, li|berty is likewi&s;e imperfect. In a perfectly free &s;tate, both the con&s;titution, and the admi|ni&s;tration of it, are full of propriety, equality, and equilibrium.</P>
<P>THESE I take to be the out lines of genu|ine liberty, which, by a proper application, may a&s;&s;i&s;t us in our enquiries after the degree of liberty enjoyed by any particular &s;tate.</P>
<P>INDEED, the circum&s;tances and occurrences, that attend human &s;tates are &s;o numerous, ex+ten&s;ive, and uncertain, that no one man, or body of men, can fore&s;ee and improve them all to the greate&s;t advantage. Hence, it frequently hap|pens, that we cannot a&s;certain the degree of li|berty enjoyed by a community, by comparing the particular parts of a con&s;titution, or the admi|ni&s;tration of it, with the ab&s;tract notion of liber|ty;

for we &s;ee but a &s;mall part of the whole &s;y&s;tem. Our views are very partial. This is the ca&s;e not only of individual &s;ubjects, but the body of government, it&s;elf, cannot, com|pleatly, comprehend the whole. Some degree of partial oppre&s;&s;ion is, therefore, to be ex|pected in every human &s;tate, even, under the wi&s;e&s;t admini&s;tration. We may, however, de|termine, in &s;ome in&s;tances, whether liberty is unnece&s;&s;arily infringed or not.

<P>WE may rea&s;on thus in a few particular in|&s;tances; but, in general, we mu&s;t form our judgments by con&s;idering the various di&s;po&s;i|tions of mankind, and by noticing their va|rious operations and effects, in various circum|&s;tances. We mu&s;t turn our attention to the facts that have already taken place; and may rea&s;onably conclude, that the &s;ame cau&s;es will always produce the &s;ame effects, unle&s;s &s;ome|thing &s;pecial prevents. One general inference from the whole will be, that liberty is much rather to be expected in a &s;tate where a ma|jority, fir&s;t, in&s;titutes, and then varies the con|&s;titution

<P>OTHER things being equal, a majority has a more general and di&s;tinct knowledge of the circum&s;tances, and exigencies of a &s;tate than a minority; and, of con&s;equence, is more able to judge of what is be&s;t to be done. Add to this, that private intere&s;t is the great idol of the human mind; and, therefore, when a ma|jority unite in any mea&s;ures, it is to be &s;up|po&s;ed, they are &s;uch mea&s;ures as are be&s;t cal|culated to &s;ecure the particular intere&s;ts of the members of that majority; and, con&s;equent|ly, the general intere&s;ts of the body are more effectually provided for, in this way, than by the &s;ecurity of the private intere&s;ts of any mi|nority whatever. And if the maxims adopted by the majority are general, both in their na|ture and extent, it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, they will prove as &s;alutary to the members of the mino|rity as to tho&s;e of the majority, and, con&s;e|quently, to the whole body Hence, though li|berty is not nece&s;&s;arily, nor invariably connect|ed with the voice of a majority; yet, it is much more likely to be found in connection with &s;uch a voice, than with that of a minority. Indeed, there is in general, no rea&s;on to ex|pect liberty where a majority is counteracted, and, on the contrary, we may hope for &s;ome good degree of it, where a majority governs.</P>
<P>IT is only on the&s;e maxims, that the pre&s;ent

<P>LET us now attend a little, to a few particu|lars that may &s;erve to excite in us &s;ome more adequate ideas of the worth of civil liberty. In|deed, none but an omni&s;cient mind can fully comprehend, and exactly e&s;timate the true worth of this ble&s;&s;ing, in its various con&s;equences, effects, and in&s;eparable concomitants, as they take place on various occa&s;ions. Our views of this &s;ubject may, however, be greatly enlarg|ed and rendered much more di&s;tinct than they generally are.</P>
<P>THAT civil liberty is of great worth, may be infered from the conduct of God towards the Jewi&s;h nation. He promi&s;ed them free|dom from the oppre&s;&s;ion of their enemies as a te&s;timony of his favour in ca&s;e of their obedi|ence; and as a cha&s;ti&s;ement for their di&s;obedi|ence, he threatned them with a &s;tate of &s;ervi|tude. From this it is certain that the omni&s;|cient God him&s;elf, e&s;teems liberty a great ble&s;&s;ing. The I&s;raelites were taught by him to &s;et their hearts much on liberty, and to a|void &s;lavery with great caution, con&s;tancy and vigour.</P>
<P>IT was ob&s;erved that liberty has its ri&s;e in

&s;uch a con&s;titution as tends to the highe&s;t good of a community, and that the due ad|mini&s;tration of &s;uch a con&s;titution affords a &s;tate of freedom. Hence, the bare idea of li|berty di&s;covers it to be an ine&s;timable good, for whatever tends to the highe&s;t good of great numbers, mu&s;t, undoubtedly, be an invaluable trea&s;ure. In this view liberty is an inexhau&s;t|able fountain, which, under God, &s;ends forth an endle&s;s variety of &s;uch &s;treams, as are both plea&s;ant and &s;alutary. I will in&s;tance in a few particulars. When we enjoy liberty, and are &s;ure of its continuance, we feel that our per|&s;ons and properties are &s;afely guarded by her watchful eye, her impartial di&s;po&s;ition and her powerful arm. This excites to indu&s;try, which tends to a competency of wealth. The va&s;&s;al, on the other hand, having no &s;ecurity of his pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, or for tho&s;e he might ob|tain, concludes &s;o uncertain a prize is not worth the &s;eeking, and therefore will do no more than barely &s;erves to &s;ilence the clamours of nece&s;&s;ity from day to day.</P>

When Kings, therefore, infringe on chartered rights they di&s;&s;olve all manner of union between them&s;elves and their &s;ubjects. The obligation is mutual, and nei|ther party can fail to fulfill the conditions on his part, without &s;eting the other free. Both parts of a cove|nant are equally &s;acred, for a King, therefore, to break that which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between him and his people, is as criminal as for the people to renounce their allegiance to him.

a &s;tate of perfect freedom? I confe&s;s liberty never has been enjoyed in perfection by any of the nations of the earth; but this by no means affects the foregoing e&s;timate.

<P>THE thoughts that have been &s;ugge&s;ted in this di&s;cour&s;e, open to us the nature of good government in its &s;everal branches. A legi&s;|lature is denominated good, from the good|ne&s;s of its laws, or, from the tendency of the laws made by it to produce the highe&s;t good of the community. In exact proportion to this tendency of the laws, is the legi&s;lature to be e&s;teemed good:&mdash;The goodne&s;s of execu|tive government, con&s;i&s;ts in its due admini&s;|tration of the laws already made. It is for the good of the community alone, that laws are ei|ther to be made or executed. So that,</P>
<P>GOOD government is not incon&s;i&s;tent with
<PB N="29" REF="013502_0028_0F90A3DC943D2700">
liberty. Perfect liberty and perfect govern|ment are perfectly harmonious, while tyranny and licentiou&s;ne&s;s are incon&s;i&s;tent with both. Yea farther,</P>
<P>GOOD government is e&s;&s;ential to the very being of liberty. Remove good government, and you remove liberty. Abridge the former and you abridge the latter.

We are all &s;tewards, to whom the God of nature has committed this talent. The de&s;ign of ap|pointing a few individuals to government, is not to free the re&s;t from their obligations but to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the di&s;charge of their duty, in the &s;ame manner that mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel are to a&s;&s;i&s;t their hearers in tho&s;e duties that re&s;pect the care of their &s;ouls. Communities ought therefore to keep an impartial and watchful eye on government. They are urg|ed to do &s;o, by a con&s;ideration of the avarici|ous, and a&s;piring di&s;po&s;itions of mankind in ge|neral, and the peculiar opportunities and temp|tations that Governors have to indulge them.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE general nature of liberty is the &s;ame in all &s;ocieties, though different circum&s;tances give it different appear|ance The &s;ame general principles that are the foundation of good government in a fa|mily are as truly &s;o in the government of a nation. The&s;e maxims are applicable not on|ly to earthly &s;ocieties, but are equally &s;o to the eternal kingdom of the great God. That government and that liberty which takes place in earthly communities is called dome&s;|tic or civil, according to their extent. When the&s;e are &s;poken of as belonging to the king|dom of God, they are termed divine or &s;piri|tual. The propriety of the manner of expre&s;|&s;ion made u&s;e of in our text, depends on the truth of the&s;e ob&s;ervations. In the thirty fir&s;t ver&s;e of the context, we are told, that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;aid to tho&s;e Jews which
<PB N="40" REF="013502_0039_0F90A3E86C6F2710">
believed on him, If ye continue in my words ye are my di&s;ciples indeed; and ye &s;hall know the truth and the truth &s;hall make you free. It &s;eems as though they did not apprehend he was &s;peaking of &s;piritual liberty but of civil, and therefore an&s;wer, We be Abraham's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eed, and were never in bondage to any man. How &s;aye&s;t thou, ye &s;hall be made free? Je&s;us th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s them to under&s;tand, that he &s;pake of &s;piritual liberty, by &s;aying&punc; Who&s;oever com|miteth &s;in is the &s;ervant of &s;in; and then he adds, The &s;ervant abideth not in the hou&s;e forever; but the &s;on abideth ever, after which follows the text. It is ob&s;ervable that our Lord in this conver&s;ation u&s;es that parti|cular word to &s;ignify &s;piritual freedom, by which they un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tood civil liberty, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch would have been altogether improper, had not their general nature been the &s;ame. We may ob&s;erve, that it is Je&s;us Chri&s;t who makes th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e free that are &s;o in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e. It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e alone who introduces them as freemen into this &s;tate, I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;on &s;hall make you free then &s;hall ye be free indeed.

<P>The freedom here &s;poken of, is no doubt, the &s;ame that in another place is called the liberty of the &s;ons of God. It is that liberty, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch tho&s;e enjoy who are born of God, have his &s;pirit, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e adopted into the number of his children.

<P>IT is ob&s;ervable that Chri&s;t calls this liber|ty, freedom indeed. Ye &s;hall be free <HI>indeed.</HI> This emphatical word was doubtle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s made u&s;e of to teach us, that &s;piritual freedom, or liberty is preferable to any other, and that it is per|fect freedom, without any mixture o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ect.</P>
<P>THE principal thought in the text, and what I propo&s;e to dwell on at pre&s;ent is, that,</P>
<P>THE &s;tate of liberty into which Je&s;us Chri&s;t introduces his di&s;ciples is far preferable to any &s;tate of earthly liberty.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject to which we attended in the forenoon, is va&s;tly important; but this is as much more important, as &s;piritual enjoyments are preferable to tho&s;e that are temporal; e|ternity to time; and as all the final ho&s;t of Heaven, which will be compo&s;ed of God, Chri&s;t, Angels and Saints, are preferable to the handful of du&s;t and a&s;hes that compo&s;e an earthly empire. It is a &s;ubject much more intere&s;ting to us, as well as more important in it&s;elf. Let me then beg your mo&s;t diligent, con&s;cientious and unbia&s;ed attention, while I endeavour to illu&s;trate and improve the ob&s;er|vation ju&s;t now deduced from the text.</P>
<P>IT was &s;aid in the former di&s;cour&s;e that li|berty

con&s;i&s;ts in the being and due admini&s;|tration of &s;uch a &s;et of laws, as tend to the highe&s;t good of the &s;ociety. If this be &s;o, it follows that liberty in a &s;tate is greater or le&s;s in exact proportion to the greater or le&s;s ten|dency of the con&s;titution and its admini&s;trati|on to the highe&s;t good of the community collectively con&s;idered. If therefore it ap|pears, on examination, that the con&s;titution of Chri&s;t's kingdom and the admini&s;tration of that con&s;titution have a &s;tronger tendency to the good of that kingdom, than the con&s;titution of any earthly kingdom, and the admini&s;tra|tion of that con&s;titution, have to the highe&s;t good of that earthly kingdom; the propo&s;iti|on is illu&s;trated and proved.</P>
<P>IN a perfectly free &s;tate the laws forbid e|very crime again&s;t the community. Every action that would be in the lea&s;t degree inju|rious to the &s;tate is forbidden.

H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> appears that no political con&s;titution on earth can extend its authority any further than to a few of the many external expre&s;&s;ions either of friend&s;hip, or di&s;affection to the &s;tate.

<P>FOR, we &s;ee, he has in fact done very many things, which, beyond all di&s;pute, are the ef|fects of de&s;ign, and not of inadvertency. Now, if tho&s;e things are done by de&s;ign, and yet not from any partial re&s;pect to any per&s;on, what, but a regard to the whole, could be the mov|ing cau&s;e? And, if regard to the whole be the moving cau&s;e of all that Chri&s;t has done, is doing, and will do, mu&s;t we not conclude, the highe&s;t good of the whole is his highe&s;t, and only ultimate end? We cannot &s;uppo&s;e o|therwi&s;e, without believing, that Chri&s;t is a being of mixed and jaring affections, which would imply great imperfection indeed. The divi&s;ion of one's affections between two dif|ferent objects, always creates a painful di&s;|cord, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the pa&s;&s;ions of the mind are in a confe&s;&s;ed &s;tate of oppo&s;ition, which is ever productive of painful &s;en&s;ations of &s;oul &mdash;

<P>JESUS CHRIST has in his mediatorial work, given the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible evidence of the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted attention to the highe&s;t good &mdash; Since he is an omnipotent being, what rea&s;on can be given why he did not call down the in|numerable ho&s;ts of mighty angels from hea|ven to de&s;troy his per&s;ecutors, or why he did &s;peak them unto hell; unle&s;s it be, that he is infinitely benevolent. Such was his regard for the highe&s;t good, that he held not his own life dear, and what is far more, he delivered him|&s;elf into the hands of his mo&s;t unrighteous, invete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate, malicious and dete&s;table enemies, to be treated according to the dictates of their accur&s;ed pride and malice. He clearly &s;aw how much their haughtine&s;s, and revenge would be gratified in his meek &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the cro&s;s, and his bitter agonies on the tree. And yet, &s;uch was his regard to the general good, that he chearfully gave them an opportunity to gratify their perver&s;e inclination, and &s;upport|ed them in exi&s;tence while they did it.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations are enough to con|vince us, that there is as much, and as pure li|berty in the kingdom of Chri&s;t, as unlimited wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s can po&s;&s;ibly pro|duce;
