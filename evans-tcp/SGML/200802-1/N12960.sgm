<P>And it came to pa&s;s that when all our Enemies heard thereof, and all the Heathen that were round about us &s;aw the&s;e things, that they were much ca&s;t down in their own eyes; for they per|ceived that this Work was wrought of our God.</P></Q>

<P>AT a time when the trial of the com|munity &s;eems brought to the CRI|SIS, when hopes and fears alternate|ly &s;well every bo&s;om which can feel for the greate&s;t intere&s;ts of mankind, it gives me plea&s;ure to &s;ee the Rulers of this State the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> to &s;tep forth and invite their con&s;tituents, by the &s;olemnities of this day, to repeat their ap|peal to the all-gracious Being who hath ever patronized the cau&s;e of virtue; who &s;till conti|nues the ju&s;t Arbiter of all events, and holds the ballance of univer&s;al empire in his hands.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="016379_0003_0F9C70E1ABBA6D70">IT is a mournful evidence of gro&s;s depravity of heart, when religious &s;ervices of this nature lo&s;e their &s;olemnity by becoming ordinary and familiar: and it is a fact which no words or tears can &s;ufficiently lament, nor any man ac|quainted with the public manners can deny, that our public fa&s;ts, &s;o frequently repeated &s;ince our pre&s;ent calamities began, are followed with &s;o little which has the &s;hew of reformation, that it is no &s;uper&s;tition to indulge a fear that they are not the fa&s;ts that the Lord has cho&s;en; but through frequency degenerated into an unmean|ing formality: this I con&s;ider as one of the mo&s;t gloomy &s;ymptoms of the times; and &s;hould it be found continuing without abatement after this day, there is rea&s;on to dread that, how|ever pious the de&s;ign of the appointment, our pretence of ob&s;erving it, without meaning any reformation in tho&s;e things that have drawn down and &s;till continue the &s;trokes of heaven upon us, will be charged again&s;t us as a repeti|tion of a deliberate mockery of the Searcher of all hearts.</P>
<P>I have ever thought it expedient, on occa&s;i|ons of this kind, to accommodate the &s;ervices of the day to the <HI>&s;pecial</HI> intent of its appoint|ment; but the Proclamation which now calls us together has not held up to view any parti|cular purpo&s;e as more e&s;pecially intended; it &s;eems rather de&s;igned to invite us to turn a&s;ide, and &s;eriou&s;ly reflect on the &s;ituation of our pub|lic affairs, con&s;idered in a complex and exten|&s;ive

<P>THE &s;truggles of an oppre&s;&s;ed people for re|covering the civil and religious privileges by which God had di&s;tingui&s;hed them from all the re&s;t of the world&mdash;the manner in which their ef|forts were conducted the oppo&s;itions they met&mdash; and the &s;ucce&s;s which crowned their virtuous labors are the &s;ubject matter of the whole of that book from whence the text is taken&mdash;the &s;cope of the in&s;pired author appears to be the &s;etting up a la&s;ting monument of one of the mo&s;t remarkable deeds of Providence in favor of the church of old, which &s;hould be to the prai&s;e of the God of I&s;rael in all &s;ucceeding ages.</P>

with the &s;imilarity between the ca&s;e of the Jew|i&s;h church, as it relates it, and that of confede|rated America at this time, and could not for|bear the mention of it to you on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>YET, as the &s;tory of the grand emancipation of the church of God cannot be fully learnt without joining the accounts of this author to tho&s;e of the other &s;acred writers that have trea|ted on the &s;ubject, and e&s;pecially to the tran&s;ac|tions related by Ezra, I &s;hall therefore, in the &s;equel, take the liberty of referring you to the author la&s;t mentioned, and to the writer of this book promi&s;cuou&s;ly, and con&s;ider the text as the conclu&s;ion to which we are pointed in the whole.</P>
<P>PROPOSITION I. All men are by na|ture alike&mdash;the faculties, powers, and pa&s;&s;ions or each &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame: to the full ex|erci&s;e of the&s;e, and to the enjoyments thence re|&s;ulting they are equally entitled.</P>
<P>SOCIALITY is e&s;&s;ential to the human frame &mdash;ab&s;olute &s;olitude is abhorred by every princi|ple in it. Felicity is improved by communica|tion&mdash;and hence from a de&s;ire of imparting the plea&s;ure he feels, as well as of &s;haring in the happine&s;s of others, man is prompted to &s;eek &s;ociety with man. To this he is urged al&s;o by a &s;en&s;e of the dangers to which his deare&s;t en|joyments are expo&s;ed from the lu&s;ts of his fel|lows&mdash;equally with him&s;elf &s;unk into a depra|vity that regards no difference between right and wrong: again&s;t the encroachments of their ap|petites
<PB N="7" REF="016379_0006_0F9C70E3EDB969F0">
his &s;ingle arm he finds to be too feeble a defence: and hence from a new nece&s;&s;ity he is &s;timulated to &s;eek the protection of others:</P>
<P>THESE principles in like manner operating on the human race in common, ea&s;ily introduce a &s;ocial compact among them; and thus God cements mankind into &s;ociety for their greater good; while each, con&s;enting to &s;ubmit his ex|erci&s;e of the &s;everal powers with which he is ve&s;|ted to the cognizance of the whole body, agrees to deny him&s;elf &s;uch gratifications as are deemed incompatible with the felicity of the re&s;t, though con&s;cious that his per&s;onal ability is &s;ufficient &s;e|parately to obtain them:</P>
<P>THIS may be con&s;idered as a re&s;ignation of certain rights po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by each in their &s;tate of nature, yet as it is equally the act of every member, their entrance into &s;ociety is on the footing of perfect equality&mdash;and the &s;urren|der being freely made for the &s;ecurity of rights e&s;teemed more valuable, no member can be a lo&s;er by the compact&mdash;the per&s;onal privileges re&s;igned being held by the &s;ociety in tru&s;t, may &s;till be &s;aid to be virtually enjoyed by the origi|nal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e no other rights may be wre&s;t|ed from men by &s;ociety&mdash;the powers ve&s;ted in its officers are delegated to them as &s;ervants of the body, and meant only to &s;ecure, to exerci&s;e, and improve the&s;e to the benefit of the owners.</P>
<P>NO man in a &s;tate of nature has a right to do wrong&mdash;therefore he can lodge no &s;uch right
<PB N="8" REF="016379_0007_0F9C70E4AC9986B8">
in the hands of &s;ociety&mdash;nor can the body pro|tect any member in a claim of this &s;ort: no man in either &s;tate may u&s;urp the rights of ano|ther which that other hath not freely conceded, nor any for which, upon conce&s;&s;ion, he has not received full compen&s;ation: no man can con|cede the rights nece&s;&s;ary to his being&mdash;or being a moral agent&mdash;a &s;ubject of moral government; of reward and puni&s;hment&mdash;the rights of pri|vate judgment and of con&s;cience are therefore as unalienable as the faculty of intelligence, and the right of acquiring and enjoying property can no more be bartered away than the natural &s;trength or genius that acquires it, or the natu|ral life which is maintained by the acqui&s;ition; partly becau&s;e the transfer cannot take place, though both parties &s;hould con&s;ent; as no man can add to the life or faculties of another by re|&s;igning to him his own; and partly becau&s;e, if it could, no equivalent could be repaid in lieu of the conce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>INDEED, when any individual goes on to abu&s;e the rights he enjoys to the de&s;truction of tho&s;e of others, he thereby threatens and endan|gers all; it is the plain dictate of the original compact, that the whole power of the commu|nity &s;hould then be employed to confine and di&s;able him&mdash;and this may be continued until he has given full compen&s;ation for the injury done, and &s;ufficient &s;ecurity again&s;t his future attempts: in no other way may men be reduced to a &s;tate of &s;ervitude, or retained in it; becau&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="016379_0008_0F9C70E56AD70E68">
no power beyond this was lodged by &s;ociety in the hands of its officers&mdash;nor could there be, &s;ince there was none in the &s;ociety it&s;elf; and this is evident, becau&s;e none &s;uch could be re|&s;igned by individuals: all exertions of power then which exceed this line are u&s;urpation, not authority: are rebellion and trea&s;on again&s;t &s;o|ciety, rea&s;on, nature and God: and as &s;uch, whenever they appear, ought to be re&s;i&s;ted, de|feated and puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE nations therefore that &s;upport or con|nive at the practice of en&s;laving the human &s;pe|cies, as an article of commerce, ought to be con&s;idered in a &s;tate of war again&s;t all mankind; &s;ince none can be thought willing to wear that public brand of the antichri&s;tian bea&s;t&mdash;a traf|fic con&s;i&s;ting of the &s;ouls of men, unle&s;s they had previou&s;ly con&s;pired the extirpation of eve|ry remain of virtue and humanity from the face of the earth:</P>
<P>TO this con&s;ideration due attention will, I tru&s;t, be paid by all the&s;e ri&s;ing States: for &s;hould a toleration of the &s;lave trade be now mingled with our new Con&s;titutions, that leaven will &s;oon corrupt the whole lump: &s;hould con|nivance at the practice of making or retaining &s;laves among&s;t our&s;elves betray a &s;ecret envy of the liberties of our fellow men, would it not en|tail the cur&s;e of heaven on all our &s;truggles for the defence of our own?</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>Societies to each other, &s;tand related no otherwi&s;e than individuals in a &s;tate of nature:</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="016379_0009_0F9C70E64809A1E8">
all po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame natural rights&mdash;within the &s;ame limitations&mdash;and on the &s;ame conditions; and there is nothing in the law of nature or the relation between them to warrant one to invade the enjoyments of another, any intire than if they were private per&s;ons, utterly unconnected with &s;ociety and each with other: what though it be granted that when two &s;ocieties go on in wickedne&s;s the one is often found to be let loo&s;e for the puni&s;hment of the other, and &s;ometimes even to the en&s;laving it? This will never weak|en the conclu&s;ion now drawn until it can be proved that the divine permi&s;&s;ion excu&s;es the &s;in of the injurious party.</P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>God has &s;et up the Jewi&s;h church as a &s;ample of his government.</HI> By it he has put a gla&s;s into the hands of the world: the con|duct of his providence towards that people <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;erve at once to guide and bound the pro&s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> of other communities in every age. In this light it would be profitable to view their hi&s;to|ry from fir&s;t to la&s;t: but the bu&s;ine&s;s now be|fore us would direct our eye more e&s;pecially to their freedom in Canaan&mdash;their wanton abu&s;e of their di&s;tingui&s;hing privileges&mdash;the ju&s;t pu|ni&s;hments of this ingratitude, particularly their captivity in Babylon&mdash;and wondrous manumi&s;|&s;ion from that &s;tate of bondage: and could we now attend to the&s;e particulars as they de&s;erve, we might find them fruitful of in&s;truction not unworthy the regard of all America at this juncture. E. g.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="016379_0010_0F9C70E788AADB58">PROP. IV. <HI>While the manners of a nation profe&s;&s;ing religion continue plea&s;ing to God, he &s;ecures their liberties again&s;t all invaders:</HI> the paternal care of his providence is as a wall of fire around them: numerous were the proofs of this in the condition of the people of I&s;rael in the days of Jo&s;hua and the Judges; how often do we there behold a weak and incon&s;iderable handful &s;uf|fice to cha&s;ti&s;e the in&s;olence of powerful ho&s;ts &mdash;one cha&s;ing a thou&s;and and two putting ten thou&s;ands to flight! Benefits of all &s;orts are ta|lents entru&s;ted to men for improvement: the enjoyment of temporal good gives new force to the virtues of the virtuous man&mdash;as chry&s;tal looks brighter in the beams of the &s;un. But through the wickedne&s;s of men the &s;miles of Providence are often perverted into provi&s;ion for lu&s;t, as the &s;howers that are &s;weet when di&s;|tilled from the clouds are turned into &s;alt when they &s;ink in the ocean. Hence pro&s;perity fre|quently becomes a poi&s;on in di&s;gui&s;e&mdash;the &s;wee|ter in ta&s;te, the more fatal in effect: nations, as well as individuals, are generally intoxicated by it&mdash;the unthankfulne&s;s of &s;ome proclaims them barren as the &s;ands of Africa&mdash;others, like Je|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">hurun, have waxed fat and kicked at the hand by which they were nouri&s;hed.</P>
<P>PROP. V. <HI>The honor of divine Government is concerned that national &s;ins meet national puni&s;h|ments:</HI> the being of God's law requires that every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and di&s;obedience receive a ju&s;t recompence of reward; the ju&s;tice of his
<PB N="12" REF="016379_0011_0F9C70E7AB8065F8">
admini&s;tration nece&s;&s;itates that the penalty be inflicted in the &s;ame mea&s;ures in which it was threatened&mdash;le&s;s will not be looked for in rea&s;on from the hand of the &s;upreme Guardian of the intere&s;ts of virtue, who by a different conduct would, more effectually than all other beings, encourage the wicked and deter the obedient. This expectation is an&s;wered by the fact: no in&s;tance of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion ever did or will pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed&mdash;the &s;inner him&s;elf &s;hall pay the debt, or his &s;urety mu&s;t di&s;charge the uttermo&s;t farthing.</P>
<P>THERE is a fitne&s;s in adapting the puni&s;h|ment to the crime, that &s;o the latter might be pointed out by the former: hence it appears congruous to wi&s;dom that they who have &s;inned together &s;hould &s;uffer in like manner&mdash;and that the fellow-&s;inner who has been the occa&s;ion&mdash; the means or incitement to the crime, &s;hould al&s;o &s;erve as the engine for the puni&s;hment of the criminal. Thus nations combined in a cour&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be dealt with collec|tively when it is puni&s;hed. Hence we conclude that national &s;ins mu&s;t be puni&s;hed in this life; becau&s;e nations, as &s;uch, exi&s;t not in the next; and &s;o, if not here, cannot at all be made to feel, in their national capacity, the de&s;ert of their crimes.</P>
<P>THE goodne&s;s of God is clearly illu&s;trated in the patience with which he forbears the &s;troke: the &s;low gradations with which his people are cor|rected di&s;cover all the father in the corrector's
<PB N="13" REF="016379_0012_0F9C70E876139CD8">
heart; whil&s;t the rod of correction is in his hand, what bowels! what meltings may be &s;een in the &s;tripes! every touch &s;eems interrupted with tho&s;e tender interrogatives 'how can I give thee up O Ephraim! how can I deliver thee O I&s;rael! my bowels are turned within me, my relentings are gathered together.'</P>
<P>THE lenity of divine government, when long abu&s;e as an argument for in&s;ult, at la&s;t is rou|&s;ed to indignation, and tho' judgments on earth are inflicted piece-meal, yet in the i&s;&s;ue the incor|rigible mu&s;t be given up to the &s;courge.</P>
<P>THE higher the ri&s;e of national guilt, the greater is the nece&s;&s;ity that the puni&s;hment be e|minent, public, and &s;peedy. The people high|e&s;t in profe&s;&s;ions and privileges &s;hould therefore be foremo&s;t under the rod. The holine&s;s of the Sovereign is publicly di&s;played when judgments begin at the hou&s;e of God. In the execution of the&s;e, he often employs his wor&s;t foes, as men u&s;e the meane&s;t &s;lave for the vile&s;t drudgery.</P>
<P>THE end of all, is to humble the &s;inning peo|ple, to bring them to repentance, and reformati|on, to the&s;e the means u&s;ed will be proportioned by wi&s;dom: not a drop of bitter will be min|gled in their cup but what is nece&s;&s;ary: not a &s;tripe laid on which their ca&s;e could di&s;pen&s;e with: nor &s;hall their heavine&s;s endure one night long|er than their need of it la&s;ts:</P>
<P>THAT the afflictions of a profe&s;&s;ing people &s;hould not fail of accompli&s;hing this end, the mo&s;t important intere&s;ts of virtue and godline&s;s re|quire:
<PB N="14" REF="016379_0013_0F9C70E92C013A70">
partly becau&s;e the &s;ins which brought them on are more highly aggravated than the &s;ins of others: and partly becau&s;e the honor of God is mo&s;t concerned that things be kept <HI>right</HI> a|mong&s;t &s;uch, le&s;t they totally go off, and religi|on thus be extinct in the world, le&s;t the ignorant and wicked &s;hould hence take occa&s;ion to call e|vil good, and religion it&s;elf be charged as patro|nizing the crimes of its profe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>WHEN the proper effect is not produced by &s;uch judgments, but the people prove hardened in their vicious ways, they have rea&s;on to expect their continuance with additional &s;everities: be|cau&s;e there is the &s;ame rea&s;on for continuing as for commencing them, and &s;imilar cau&s;es pro|duce &s;imilar effects: and over and above the cau|&s;es pa&s;t the new degrees of hardne&s;s which have with&s;tood the remedy already applied, make per|&s;everance in correcting nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate the honor of God's unchangeablene&s;s, omnipotence, and infallible wi&s;dom in the choice of means ef|fectual to the end. Thus we &s;ee the people of I&s;rael, gradually threatened, and gradually puni&s;h|ed; but di&s;covering an obduracy which was proof again&s;t all, they were at la&s;t led captives to Ba|bylon, and rivetted on them&s;elves the chain of &s;lavery.</P>
<P>A people thus ripened for the judgments of heaven in vain &s;eek protection from their rulers: the magi&s;trate who has led on the general revolt from the ways of God, &s;eldom fails to prove as active a tool in aggravating the woes that ensue

thereon: &s;o Jehoiakin con&s;ents to curry favor for him&s;elf, by abetting the tyranny of the Chalde|an monarch and confirming the &s;lavery of his own captivated &s;ubjects: mi&s;erable reward in|deed for the unlimited obedience they had for|merly paid him!&mdash;Poor wages truly for loyalty to a king maintained by a cour&s;e of rebellion a|gain&s;t God! Thus tyrants falling like falling an|gels, never choo&s;e to &s;uffer alone, their di&s;appoint|ed pride, impatient of any comforts &s;urpa&s;&s;ing their own, makes them re&s;olved enemies of all mankind; and will &s;train every nerve to pull all down into the &s;ame ruin with them&s;elves.</P>

behold him emerging into honor and power. Sometimes the great Deliverer choo&s;es a pebble from their own brook to pro&s;trate their mo&s;t gi|gantic oppre&s;&s;ors, and &s;ometimes he moves the heart of an alien to re&s;tore them the liberty which their own kings overthrew.
