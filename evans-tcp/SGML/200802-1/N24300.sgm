<HEAD>THE CONVERSATION <HI>&amp;</HI> CONDUCT, OF THE LATE UNFORTUNATE JOHN YOUNG.</HEAD>
<P>THE Public mind has been of late much exerci&s;ed by the fate of the unfortunate John Young. I was the fir&s;t per&s;on who vi&s;ited him after his receiving &s;entence of death. I attended him on Sunday, the 6th of Augu&s;t, at which time I addre&s;&s;ed him on the fall of man, the nature of &s;in in general, and of that in particular for which he had been condemned: And endeavoured to lay before him, the awful con&s;equences of dying in an impenitent &s;tate, but all that was &s;aid at that time, &s;eemed to have had but little effect on him. He did not how|ever, di&s;cover an unwillingne&s;s to receive in&s;truction re&s;pecting the things of God. The next day, two friends vi&s;ited him, and one of them &s;peaking abrubtly of the murder he had committed, he &s;eemed to re&s;ent it, and a&s;ked him, if he came there to ubraid him. The &s;ame day another friend paid him a vi&s;it, and conver&s;ed with him largely on his dangerous &s;ituation, when he confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a lo&s;t &s;inner, and wept bitterly on account of his &s;ins in general, and the late un|happy event in particular. He told me he was deeply affected at the &s;ituation of Mr. Barwick's wife and children, and that he &s;hould be the means of making her a widow and them fatherle&s;s. He in|formed me at the &s;ame time that he left fifty dollars to Mrs. Barwick for to help to educate her children, to be paid when his debts are re|covered by his attorney, as there will be more than that on balance. From the fir&s;t time the friend before mentioned vi&s;ited him, he &s;eemed to have different views of him&s;elf than he had before; he was truly weary, and heavy laden; his head &s;eemed to be waters and his eyes a fountain of tears; for like penitent David, he often water|ed his couch with them. He opened the Bible and &s;hewed me the 51&s;t P&s;alm, &s;aying, that is greatly ble&s;&s;ed to me. But as he was amazingly ignorant of the word of God, he &s;pent much of his time in reading the Appeal to Rea&s;on and matter of Fact; this was the chief in&s;trument of opening to his view Chri&s;t crucified; and the all-&s;ufficiency of his blood and Righteou&s;ne&s;s to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t, all that come unto God by him. As the per&s;ons who &s;o frequently vi&s;ited him, had not been backward in &s;peaking the alarming awakening truths of God to him hitherto; &s;o now (when they found he was &s;ick and wounded) they were not back ward in pointing him to the good phy&s;ician the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;They &s;ang and prayed with him continually, and he with them that the Lord would relieve him, bur&s;t his &s;piritual fet|ters,
<PB N="4" REF="032133_0004_0FF15082A69D8F20">
and reveal his love to him. The Lord fulfilled his promi&s;e, <HI>To this man will I look, unto him who is humble and of a contrite &s;pirit, and trembleth at my word</HI>:&mdash;He took away his burthen, and gave him peace and happine&s;s, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at lea&s;t for the three la&s;t days he liv|ed. Now he became all engaged with the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;He told me and others that he went a&s;leep, praying unto the Lord Je&s;us, and he was the fir&s;t in his thoughts when he awoke. Was not this &s;ome|thing like what David &s;ays? <HI>When I awake I am &s;till with thee.</HI>&mdash;The Lord was gracious in directing to &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the Bible, Fletch|er's Appeal, and the Hymn Books he had, that were peculiarly ap|plicable to his &s;tate. He &s;hewed me places turn'd down in &s;everal of them; &s;aying, the&s;e I opened promi&s;cuou&s;ly&punc; O what a Book is that, exclaimed he, alluding to Fletcher's Appeal. What do you &s;ee &s;aid I when you read it? He replied, "I &s;ee the beauty of the upper world." The day before his execution I &s;pent two hours with him a|lone; a great part of the time interrogating him re&s;pecting the &s;tate of his mind, that I might be &s;atisfied whether he was building on the &s;and or on the Rock of Ages: And I was fully convinced that he was building upon the rock, for,
<Q><L>"No &s;trength of his own, or goodne&s;s he claim'd,</L>
<L>"His &s;trength was all thrown, on Je&s;us's name,</L></Q>
I found the fear of death taken away, and peace and happine&s;s po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing his mind. At this time he told me a dream, which he had that morning, "I dreamed" &s;aid he, "that &s;everal per&s;ons came to &s;ee me, and that one of them a&s;ked me if I was happy? I an&s;wered I am: He a&s;ked me again if I was afraid to die? I an&s;wered no: He a&s;ked me if I had the full a&s;&s;urance of faith? I an&s;wered, I had not: He then replied, I have it for you! but, you will not receive it un|til you come near the place of execution. To which I an&s;wered, I hope the Lord will give it to you to night, when I and my friends, will &s;tay with and pray for you. About 10 o'clock, three friends and my&s;elf entered his cell to &s;tay with him,&mdash;&s;uch a night I never expe|rienced! We &s;ang, prayed, and conver&s;ed alternately 'till two o'clock, but it did not &s;eem that half the time was &s;pent. With great pro|priety one of the friends &s;ung,</P>
<P>'Pri&s;ons would palaces prove, if Je&s;us would dwell with me there', It was indeed, more like a rational congratulatory vi&s;it to a bride|groom, or a man about to be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of great earthly happi|ne&s;s, than a vi&s;it to one, who in a few hours was to &s;uffer an igno|minious death. How indeed, could we be &s;ad? to &s;ee a man in fet|ters, and yet at liberty, in pri&s;on, and yet &s;eemingly in a palace! con|demned to death, and in a few hours to have the &s;entence executed up|on him, and yet &s;piritually alive to God, &s;o that not only re&s;ignation to his fate was evident, but a con&s;tant chearfulne&s;s and &s;erenity which is the re&s;ult of a mind at peace with God, and all mankind. He talk|ed rationally of the vanity of this world, of men in general, and
<PB N="5" REF="032133_0005_0FF1507D8E1410A0">
of him&s;elf in particular; in not &s;erving God, and glorifying his name, and ob&s;erved, the rea&s;on was, becau&s;e men were di&s;&s;ipated and inor|dinately attached to the things of this world:&mdash;For, &s;aid he, if men would but exerci&s;e their rea&s;on aright, they would live to God.</P>
<P>When conver&s;ing on re&s;ignation to Divine Providence in general, and particularly his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, he more than once &s;aid, if the Governor, would grant me a reprief, when at the place of executi|on, I do not know that I would take the trouble of writing for it.</P>
<P>We repeatedly a&s;ked him, if he inclined to &s;leep? He an&s;wered, "not in the lea&s;t;" but we advi&s;ed him to &s;trive to doze a little, as we thought it would be better for him. He did &s;o, and &s;hortly after, fell a&s;leep, and &s;lept as compo&s;ed as any one po&s;&s;ibly could. About half pa&s;t three o'clock, we concluded to go home and refre&s;h our&s;elves, as he was &s;till a&s;leep, and return again to accompany him to the place of execution. I returned at half pa&s;t &s;even, and was about an hour alone with him, before any one came. When I went into the Dungeon, I a&s;ked him how he found his mind? He an&s;wered with a placid &s;erenity, "I am comfortable thank God." What did you think, &s;aid I, when you awoke and found the light out, and we not there? He &s;aid, "I imagined the lamp went out, and that perhaps you were all a&s;leep, till the day-light convinced me ye were gone." How did you feel your mind exerci&s;ed, &s;aid I, when you awoke? "I found it thinking on the Lord Je&s;us," &s;aid he, "and while I was meditating alone, I thought what a poor helple&s;s &s;inner I was, that had nothing to bring to God as an offer|ing, but the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t:" I an&s;wered, That is enough, for that is the &s;acrifice that is acceptable to Him.</P>
<P>O! in how many in&s;tances did I &s;ee this &s;cripture exemplified in him. <HI>My &s;pirit &s;hall take of the things that are mine, and &s;hew them unto you.</HI> I &s;ang a hymn, and he then reque&s;ted me to &s;ing the one that we had &s;ung in the night, and which had Glory be to God on High for the chorus. We &s;ang it, and he reque&s;ted that it &s;hould be one of the hymns we &s;hould &s;ing going to the place of execution. About half pa&s;t nine o'clock, his chains were taken off, and his cloaths brought. As &s;oon as he &s;tood up, he &s;aid to the turn-key, "Well, George, you won't have the trouble of putting tho&s;e irons on me any more, he then wa&s;hed his legs and feet, and dre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf with the &s;ame degree of compo&s;ure and cheerfulne&s;s he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the day before.&mdash;When he was done, he took his old cloaths and put them in his bed, and turned it up. Then he took his hymn-book, and we &s;ang and prayed, till the Sheriff and Jailor came to have him prepared tor his execution. When he was pini|oned, and the rope about his neck, the Sheriff kindly gave him a quarter of an hour longer to pray. After one or two per&s;ons had prayed, he de&s;ired me to turn down the hymns that were to be &s;ung,
<PB N="6" REF="032133_0006_0FF1512E1CF39F00">
choo&s;ing two favourite hymns for him&s;elf, and left the others to me. As he came through the Pri&s;on, &s;ome of the genteeler Debtors came and took their la&s;t farewell of him with affected hearts, and gu&s;hing eyes, which greatly affected him. When he came out into the &s;treet, there was a con&s;iderable noi&s;e, occa&s;ioned by the va&s;t con|cour&s;e of people that crouded. We &s;topped there a few minutes, 'till the Militia was ready. Fearing the noi&s;e would di&s;&s;ipate his mind, I a&s;ked him if I &s;hould begin to &s;ing? He an&s;wered, "no, not 'till we are &s;tarted and out of the noi&s;e, I want to be recollected and meditate." So inten&s;ely was his mind fixed on the Lord Je&s;us, that he declared to me, that the affectedne&s;s of his friends (though it affected him) and the noi&s;e of the people, did not hurt his confi|dence in Je&s;us.&mdash;As &s;oon as we &s;tarted, he and the friends that were with us, &s;ung, the following hymns.</P>
<LG>
<L>JESUS, my Lord attend</L>
<L>Thy feeble creature's cry:</L>

<L>And in that faith to die.</L>

<P><PB REF="032133_0008_0FF15080F2952478">When we &s;topped a little di&s;tance from the Gallows, he came to the ver&s;e Here I'll rai&s;e my Ebenezer, &amp;c. then we that attended him, could perceive the remarkable happine&s;s and &s;trength that beamed forth in his countenance. We who had heard him relate the dream he had the day before, &s;aid to him, "We believe your dream is now accompli&s;hed; Have you the full a&s;&s;urance of faith?" "Yes," exclaimed he, "I have, glory be to God. When we had fini&s;hed the hymn and chorus, we &s;topt, but he would not; but cried out again, Glory, glory, glory, &amp;c. He then went up into the Cart under the Gallows, and I with him. A little while after he turned about to me, and &s;aid, "in about half an hour more, I &s;hall be in the arms of Je&s;us." One of the friends gave an Exhorta|tion to the va&s;t multitude that was convened; and I &s;poke a few words re&s;pecting the &s;tate of his mind; after which, he &s;aid to me, "Go, and &s;ee the writing I left in the Pri&s;on be put to print." We then joined in &s;inging the following Hymn:</P>
<LG>
<L>HAPPY &s;oul, thy days are ended;</L>
<L>All thy mourning days below;</L>
<L>Go by Angel guards attended.</L>
<L>To the &s;ight of Je&s;us go.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Waiting to receive thy Spirit,</L>
<L>Lo the Saviour &s;tands above,</L>
<L>Shews the purcha&s;e of his merit,</L>
<L>Reaches out the crown of love.</L>
</LG>

<L>To thy dear redeemer's brea&s;t,</L>
<L>To his uttermo&s;t &s;alvation,</L>
<L>To his everla&s;ting re&s;t:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For the joy he &s;ets before thee,</L>
<L>Bear a momentary pain,</L>
<L>Die, to live a life of glory,</L>
<L>Suffer, with thy Lord to reign.</L>
</LG>
<P>The Sheriff a&s;ked him, if he wi&s;hed to &s;ay anything, he an&s;wered "nothing, but that I die in the fear and grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t." He then wi&s;hed me farewell, pulled the cap over his face, and in a quarter of an hour after, he was in Eternity. He died with an ea&s;e that a&s;toni&s;hed the &s;urrounding &s;pectators. However di&s;&s;ipated he might have lived, however aggravated the crime might have been that was the cau&s;e of his &s;hameful death, it mu&s;t appear evident to every impartial mind, he died a &s;ubject of Divine Mercy and Favor, on Thur&s;day, Augu&s;t 17, 1797. Aged 40 Years, and 4 Days.</P>
