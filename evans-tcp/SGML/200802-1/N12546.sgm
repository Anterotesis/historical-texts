<P><HI>YOU may remember with what reluctance I yielded with a kind of &s;ilent &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the motion of our late Convention, whereof you were a part for giv|ing a copy of my &s;ermon for the pre&s;s. I urged the critical and difficult times, my want of lei&s;ure, and the like. Under awe of the honorable Convention, in their pre&s;ence after prayer the next morning, I &s;aid but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ttle, fearing it might be taken as a want of zeal for our injured country, or the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed plantations.

Hence the di&s;|cour&s;e, delivered extempore after my riding in the heat that day, had not been &s;o well dige&s;ted, nor was &s;o well delivered, as it &s;hould have been, before &s;uch an honorable audience on &s;uch an important occa&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I came home re&s;olved however, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pro&s;ecute the bu&s;ine&s;s; but</HI> Ticonderoga <HI>was di&s;gracefully evacuated the next Sabbath: our I&s;rael turned their back upon their enemies.

<HEAD>A well tempered Self-Love a Rule of Conduct towards others.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>MATTHEW VII. 12.</BIBL>
<Q>THEREFORE, ALL THINGS WHATSOEVER YE WOULD THAT MEN SHOULD DO TO YOU, DO YE EVEN SO TO THEM: FOR THIS IS THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE illative particle <HI>therefore,</HI> leads us back to ver&s;e 1 and 2, <HI>Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye &s;hall be judged: and with what mea&s;ure ye mete, it &s;hall be mea&s;ured to you again.</HI> q. d. Do not judge and cen&s;ure others, further than you would think it rea&s;onable and ju&s;t for you in a like ca&s;e to be judged and cen&s;ured. Give no wor&s;e mea&s;ure to a neighbour, than you would think it fit and ju&s;t to receive from him, could you exchange &s;ides, and you be in his ca&s;e and he in your's. Or the reference may be to ver&s;e 7, <HI>A&s;k, and it &s;hall be given you: &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find,</HI> &amp;c. Then it intimates, that, if in an&s;wer to our prayers, we would receive good things from God, we mu&s;t do things fair, ju&s;t, and of good report one towards another. Zech. 7.
<PB N="6" REF="015855_0004_0F9A2E9C51E33940">
9, 10, &amp; 13. <HI>Thus &s;peaketh the LORD of ho&s;ts, &s;aying, Execute true judgment, and &s;hew mercy and compa&s;&s;ion every man to his brother. And oppre&s;s not the widow, nor the fatherle&s;s, the &s;tranger, nor the poor: and let none of you imagine evil again&s;t his brother in your heart. Therefore it is come to pa&s;s, that as he cried and they would not hear, &s;o they cried and I would not hear, &s;aith the LORD of ho&s;ts.</HI> I&s;a. 1. 15. <HI>And when ye &s;pread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</HI> God heareth not &s;inners acting in contempt of his moral law, and e&s;pecially the law of the &s;econd table, re&s;pecting our duty one to another.</P>
<P>BUT this golden rule, uttered by our Judge and Lawgiver, Prince and Saviour, in the &s;ermon on the mount, is &s;uited to all the circum&s;tances and conditions of human life: very proper on the pre&s;ent important occa&s;ion; for it is fit for all occa&s;ions, and &s;uitable for every relation; good for all com|munities and orders of men, in this evil world. The very work of righteou&s;ne&s;s, by this rule, is peace; and the effect of righteou&s;ne&s;s, quietne&s;s and a&s;&s;urance forever.</P>
<P>THE whole of our duty, to God and man, is briefly &s;um|med up, Mat. 22. 37 on. <HI>Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind. This is the fir&s;t and great commandment. And the &s;econd is like unto it, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf. On the&s;e two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</HI> They are the &s;ub&s;tance of all that Mo&s;es and the Prophets have written, as rules of duty to God and men. Rom 13. 8, on. <HI>He that loveth another, hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou &s;halt not commit adultery, Thou &s;halt not kill, Thou &s;halt not &s;teal, Thou &s;halt not bear fal&s;e witne&s;s, Thou &s;halt not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this &s;aying, namely, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI> Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="015855_0005_0F9A2E9CCF43A760">
THE rule in the text is the &s;ame in effect as loving our neighbour as our&s;elves, or a branch from that &s;acred root: or it is that excellent law reduced to practice, and comprehends the whole law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and writings of the prophets, &s;o far as they have taught us our duty, in our &s;everal relations one to another.</P>
<P>THIS divine law, for regulating our moral conduct, is very plain and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood; it is conci&s;e, and ea&s;y to be remembered. Any man that has the faculty of rea&s;on, and a will to do his duty to his fellow creatures, by the aid of &s;elf-love, may &s;oon di&s;cern it in the gla&s;s of this rule. Self-love is fir&s;t, or it could not be a rule of loving our neigh|bour. By a natural and innocent &s;elf-love, we fir&s;t look within, and con&s;ider what we would in rea&s;on have done to us, in the like ca&s;e, and proceed to conduct in like manner towards others.</P>
<P>AWAY then with all the metaphy&s;ical jargon of the &s;chools, or of our my&s;tical divines, that pretend in that way to teach us our duty; and attend to the wi&s;e in&s;tructor, who u&s;ed great plainne&s;s of &s;peech, and taught the way of God in truth. <HI>What&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, &amp;c.</HI></P>

</LIST>
<P>I. EXPLAIN and illu&s;trate this excellent rule.</P>
<P>A VICIOUS &s;elf-love and hatred of others, will render us incapable of entering into the &s;pirit of the text. It doth not mean that we &s;hould do to others, as an heart leavened with malice and wickedne&s;s, and hatred of God's law, would in that temper wi&s;h to have done to us. The wicked join hand in hand; aid a &s;inful companion to perpetrate, and cover &s;in,
<PB N="8" REF="015855_0006_0F9A2E9D90EA8160">
hoping for the like deceitful favours from him again. But this is a con&s;piracy again&s;t the whole moral law, and making it void: yea it is an impious, and daring attempt to jo&s;tle the Almighty Ruler from his throne, and repeal the &s;acred de|calogue, and cancel all our bonds of duty to the &s;upreme king. An unju&s;t judge that neither fears GOD nor regards man, may thus think with him&s;elf, If I was in the ca&s;e of this poor criminal at the bar, I &s;hould wi&s;h to be di&s;charged, howe|ver unju&s;t it might be; I will therefore acquit him, and do as I would be done by. But the judge ought to a&s;k him&s;elf thus, if I was in the ca&s;e of this pri&s;oner, what could I in rea&s;on a&s;k of a judge, con&s;i&s;tent with his office, the honor of law and rights of ju&s;tice? The an&s;wer would be, &s;o much mercy as is con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, the honor of government, and faithfulne&s;s of his office, and no more. What&s;oever in a con&s;i&s;tency with truth, with rea&s;on and ju&s;|tice, we would that men &s;hould do to us, &s;o &s;hould we do to them. We mu&s;t not counteract our &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, the honor of law, or maje&s;ty of con&s;cience, under a mi&s;taken notion of this rule. <HI>Him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away,</HI> &s;ounds as obliging us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever. But let common &s;en&s;e bring the words to this infallible te&s;t, thus. My neighbour a&s;ks &s;uch a favour: if I grant it I &s;hall di&s;oblige my&s;elf, five times as much as I &s;hall oblige him. Could I in honor and rea&s;on, a&s;k him to injure him|&s;elf &s;o much to oblige me &s;o little? Surely no.</P>
<P>I WILL therefore deny him. <HI>Rutilius,</HI> the noble <HI>Roman,</HI> be|ing reque&s;ted to do an unworthy thing for his friend, re|fu&s;ed. Whereupon his friend reproached him as violating the &s;acred laws of friend&s;hip. He then replied in a manner be|coming his &s;en&s;e of honor; "I can well bear the lo&s;s of &s;uch a friend, who&s;e friend&s;hip cannot be pre&s;erved, but upon the hard terms of breaking thro' all the laws of ju&s;tice and honor." This ma&s;ter-piece of human nature, merely by natu|ral light, did as he would be done by.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="015855_0007_0F9A2E9E524EB0F8">
ALL orders of men may &s;oon find out their duty, if they are willing to know and do it. Thus. The hu&s;bandman may &s;ay, if I followed any trade or other bu&s;ine&s;s for my &s;upport, &s;hould I think it ju&s;t to &s;et &s;uch an exorbitant price for the nece&s;&s;aries of life; to u&s;e extortion, and make a neighbour's nece&s;&s;ity my opportunity to exact more than is meet? The lawyer may &s;ay, was I in the place of my poor client, at the head of a needy family, could I think it ju&s;t to exact &s;uch a fee, and have my ca&s;e put off from court to court? The merchant may &s;ay, was I the buyer, &s;hould I think it rea&s;onable to give &s;uch a price? The magi&s;trate may &s;ay, was I the &s;ubject, could I think it ju&s;t, to be ruled with &s;uch rigour, and have my life made bitter by cruel bondage? A ma&s;ter may &s;ay, if I was the poor &s;er|vant, &s;hould I not think &s;uch &s;everity hard and unju&s;t, and quite unbecoming one that has a ma&s;ter in heaven, with whom there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons?</P>
<P>WE find <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> Gen. 42. 17. u&s;ing a judicious, nece&s;&s;ary, and well timed &s;everity towards his brethren; but on the third day after their impri&s;onment, &s;ays, <HI>this do and live: for I fear GOD.</HI> He mu&s;t for&s;ake the fear of the almighty, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his afflicted brethren, tho' under a nece&s;&s;ary di&s;cipline. He will be as tender and benevolent towards them, as his judicious &s;oul could wi&s;h them to be, were they in his ca&s;e, and he in theirs. He had him&s;elf been in pri&s;on. The irons had entered into his &s;oul, and his feet hurt with fetters. He had learned to pity the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and &s;trangers, by the things he had &s;uffered, and as the law in the text, then un|written, was re&s;plendent in his con&s;cience. The like fear of God, and benevolence to men we find in Job 31. 13, on. <HI>If I did de&s;pi&s;e the cau&s;e of my man-&s;ervant, or of my maid &s;er|vant, when they contended with me: what then &s;hall I do when God ri&s;eth up? and when he vi&s;iteth, what &s;hall I an&s;wer him? Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fa&s;hion us in the womb?</HI> Ver. 21. <HI>If I have lift up my hand again&s;t the fatherle&s;s, when I &s;aw my help in the

gate: for de&s;truction from God was a terror to me, and by rea&s;on of his highne&s;s I could not endure.</HI> In a word, that judicious tenderne&s;s, and generous benevolence, which never fail to accompany the fear of the Almighty, will guide us in the path of duty according to this rule. None of us will live to him&s;elf, but as members one of another And as ma|ny as thus walk by this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of God.</P>
<P>THIS path of our indi&s;pen&s;able duty, is the &s;ure way for the lengthening our own tranquility; and our peace and hap|pine&s;s are clo&s;ely linked with our duty. This law is liberty, and this &s;ervice freedom: in keeping this commandment, there is great reward.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If any thing further need be &s;aid to illu&s;trate the genuine &s;en&s;e of this go den rule, and prevent mi&s;takes about it; let us attend to the following &s;tory. <HI>Contentus</HI> had an e&s;tate of &pound;.9000, <HI>Avarus</HI> of &pound;.3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">00, <HI>Penitus</HI> of &pound;.1000. <HI>Avarus</HI> being blind thro' covetou&s;ne&s;s, to the &s;en&s;e of the rule, a&s;ks of <HI>Contentus</HI> &pound;.3000 of his e&s;tate to make him e|qual, and pleads the text. Had you, &s;ays he, but &pound;.3000. and I &pound;.9000, you would have me give you the &s;um I a&s;k of you, and mu&s;t do as you would be done by. <HI>Penitus,</HI> who penetrated deep in|to the affair, after a judicious pau&s;e, charges <HI>Avarus</HI> with covetou&s;ne&s;s, and engages to prove it upon him; not by a train of laboured rea|&s;onings, which he knew, <HI>Avarus</HI> could not comprehend, but by a blow at the root. Thus, &s;ays he, <HI>Contentus</HI> has thrice as much as you, and you have thrice as much as I; now give me &pound;.1000 of your e&s;tate, and make me equal with you, otherwi&s;e, I mu&s;t conclude, that not from a &s;en&s;e of the rule, but from evil covetou&s;ne&s;s you a&s;ked &pound;.3000 of <HI>Contentus</HI> He was confounded; his own con&s;cience re|preached him, not for violating the law in withholding the money a&s;k|ed by <HI>Penitus,</HI> but for perverting the &s;en&s;e of it, and making it to &s;ub&s;erve the intere&s;t of his avarice; while he is eagerly gra&s;ping at the e&s;tate of <HI>Contentus,</HI> which belongeth not to him.</NOTE></P>
<P>II. THE rea&s;on to enforce it: <HI>For this is the law and the prophets.</HI> If we mean to claim kindred with <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and the prophets, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his apo&s;tles, we mu&s;t attend to this gold|en rule. If we &s;et it a&s;ide, we di&s;card all the &s;acred wri|ters
<PB N="11" REF="015855_0009_0F9A2EA08FEA5F10">
and refu&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to that one Lawgiver, who is able to &s;ave and to de&s;troy. If we have any reverence for the Jewi&s;h lawgiver, who was king in <HI>Je&s;urun:</HI> any regard to that &s;pirit of truth that in&s;pired all the prophets, or to our King on the holy hill of <HI>Zion,</HI> who is now in the mid&s;t of the throne in heaven, and &s;itteth King forever: or to the words of in&s;piration in the writings of the apo&s;tles of the Lamb, we mu&s;t attend to this law. But if we ca&s;t this law behind our back, it will be interpreted, that we will not have Chri&s;t to reign over us. Let us not divide Chri&s;t from his own law, or &s;eparate <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the prophets from their own writings; as the infidel <HI>Jews</HI> built the &s;epulchres of the prophets, pretending a mighty reverence for their per&s;ons, while they rejected and crucified the Lord of Glory, to whom all the prophets gave witne&s;s. The doctrine and law of Chri&s;t is Chri&s;t. Eph. 4. 20. <HI>But ye have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> as a le&s;&s;on. So when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the prophets are &s;aid to be read, we under&s;tand their writings. Let us then receive this law from the mouth of our gracious lawgiver, and lay up this his commandment in our hearts, or give up all the &s;acred laws of the holy bible. The &s;hocking con&s;e|quences of this latter, you may prove by arguing from the le&s;s to the greater, in the words of him that is ordained of God to be judge both of quick and dead. Mat. 5. 19. <HI>Who|&s;oever therefore &s;hall break one of the&s;e lea&s;t commandments, and &s;hall teach men &s;o, he &s;hall be called the lea&s;t in the kingdom of heaven.</HI></P>
<P>III. POINT out duty in &s;ome &s;pecial ca&s;es by this unerring rule.</P>
<P N="1">1. I PRAY you, my friends and brethren, to take a tour with me over to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and &s;ee this divine law intro|duced at the highe&s;t court of the nation, or at a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> junto, laying a plot to en&s;lave <HI>America.</HI> But fir&s;t allow me to take one thing for granted, which I am &s;ure you cannot in honor, or with truth and ju&s;tice deny me, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that the king and parliament, and all the mini&s;ters of &s;tate in <HI>Old-England,</HI> are as fully bound and obliged by this law, as the meane&s;t pea|&s;ants. He that &s;itteth on the circle of the earth, beholds the inhabitants thereof as gra&s;hoppers before him, and regardeth
<PB N="12" REF="015855_0010_0F9A2EA150A8A218">
the rich no more than the poor, for they all are the work of his hands. Di&s;tempered minds may have re&s;pect to him that weareth the gay cloathing, and de&s;pi&s;e the man in vile apparel; but God doth not &s;o. He &s;ees the difference to be trivial and momentary. They will &s;oon he down alike in the du&s;t, and the worms &s;hall cover them. The potentates of the earth, that in contempt of God make a prey of their fellow creatures, will find &s;ooner or later, that God is more glorious than the&s;e mountains of prey.

But before we attend the council, let one thing be granted, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that we all ought, with great reverence and humiliation, to &s;ubmit to God, and own his hand. Who gave <HI>Jacob</HI> to the &s;poil, and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to the robbers? Is it not the Lord, again&s;t whom we have &s;o grievou&s;ly &s;inned? God has drawn out a &s;word again&s;t us, to avenge the quarrel of his covenant. And his anger is not yet turned away, but his hand is &s;tretched out &s;till. For the people turn not to him that &s;miteth them, nor do they (duly) &s;eek the Lord of ho&s;ts. The wicked cha&s;ti&s;ing the people of God, are his hand and &s;word. We mu&s;t have our uncircumci&s;ed hearts humbled, and accept of the puni&s;hment of our iniquity, receive correction, own that God is righteous, and that we are wicked.</P>
<P>AFTER the wicked coun&s;el of <HI>Balaam</HI> to draw <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to &s;in, that they might be for&s;aken of God, and become a prey to the <HI>Moabites,</HI> it was ever the cunning craft and policy of the enemies of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> to fall upon them, when they for&s;ook God, and their defence departed from them. Would the <HI>Britons</HI> have dared thus to magnify them|&s;elves again&s;t this people of the Lord of ho&s;ts, had they not been appri&s;ed of our declen&s;ions, and abounding iniquities? The iniqui|ties of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> often brought them low, and withheld good things from them; as we are now brought low by our iniquities. But &s;hall we &s;ubmit to men, in what appears to us a matter of wrong and inju&s;tice? Some tool of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> tyranny &s;tands up in it's de|fence,

and pre&s;&s;es &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. <Q>We are obliged to fear and honor the king, to be &s;ubject to the higher powers, to obey magi&s;trates, and &s;ubmit to every ordinance of man, and not meddle with them that are given to change. The powers that be are ordained of God. Many of us are under an oath of allegiance: great would be the guilt of perjury if we re&s;ith. We ought to obey the king's commandment, and that in regard to the oath of God, which obliges us to non-re&s;i&s;tance and pa&s;&s;ive obedience.</Q></P>
<P><Q>FURTHER, we cannot with&s;tand the power of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> She has long in a good mea&s;ure held the balance of <HI>Europe.</HI> We have neither coun&s;el, nor &s;trength, nor preparations for the war.

Let us attend to an <HI>American</HI> pa|triot, and hear what can be &s;aid in reply. <Q>We owe our fir&s;t and chief &s;ubjection to the &s;upreme King: and the fear of God is fir&s;t before the fear of an earthly king. Our obedience to earthly rulers is to be for the Lord's &s;ake, and in obedience to him. They mu&s;t then conduct as his vicegerents, be the mini&s;ters of God for good to the people; act in character as benefactors to mankind, &s;hepherds of the people, to watch over, feed, protect, and rule them to their, own happine&s;s. An earthly ruler mu&s;t indeed be obeyed while he guides and governs in the integrity of his heart, and by the &s;kilfulne&s;s of his hands.

The great proprietor of the univer&s;e, and the God of the whole earth has given us our lands, by almo&s;t as great won|ders as tho&s;e wrought for <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> in giving them the land of <HI>Canaan.</HI> It has been the practice, and is till this day, to purcha&s;e them of the natives; and our lands have been guaranteed to us by the king of <HI>England.</HI> Is not all this enough to make out our title? Mu&s;t we now be turned out of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which God hath given us to inherit? Mu&s;t we be &s;ervants in the land which we have &s;o good a title to? When king <HI>Ahab</HI> received the &s;ummons from <HI>Benhadad</HI> to &s;urrender, 1 Kings, 20. 3. <HI>Thy &s;ilver and thy gold is mine, thy wives al&s;o and thy children, even the goodlie&s;t are mine:</HI> he &s;ubmitted upon this tenor&mdash;<HI>My lord O king, according to thy &s;aying, I am thine, and all that I have.</HI> i. e. I will pay homage to thee as my liege Lord. But the cruelty and covetou&s;ne&s;s of the tyrant, like the hor&s;eleech's two daughters, crying, <HI>Give, give,</HI> being embolden|ed by &s;o ready and tame a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he proceeds to add in&s;ult to a mo&s;t extravagant demand; the &s;ub&s;tance of which was, that his &s;ervants &s;hould &s;earch his hou&s;e, and take what they plea&s;ed, and e&s;pecially what was mo&s;t plea&s;ant and goodly in the eyes of <HI>Ahab.</HI> The elders of the land were then con&s;ulted. They all agree not to hearken to &s;uch a cruel in&s;ulting demand. <HI>This thing I may not do,</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="015855_0020_0F9A2EA8D0BA2E48">
is the me&s;&s;age back. There is a <HI>may not,</HI> or a <HI>cannot,</HI> in &s;uch ca&s;es. God then frowned upon the in&s;ulting foe. If we &s;truggle for our liberties, and are conquered, we may be humbled and reformed, and God may at length pity his people. The wheels may turn, but if we give up our liberties, before they are by violence wre&s;ted from us, they are gone forever.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t popular plea for a tame &s;urrender of our all, to be bound in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, is that propo&s;ed by <HI>Sennacherib,</HI> I&s;a. 36. 16. A plea likely to prevail with people that are weak, unthinking and &s;oon weary of the troubles of the war. <HI>Thus &s;aith the king of A&s;&s;yria, make an agreement with me by a pre&s;ent, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his figtree, and drink ye every one of the waters of his own ci&s;tern: until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. Hezekiah</HI> had given him above two hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, to turn away from him, and yet in violation of the treaty, and without returning the money, he would per&s;uade them to tru&s;t him with their all; and that they may thereby better their condition. But tyrants with all their fair pro|mi&s;es, are political hypocrites; and they that believe them are en|&s;nared. The whole truth is not told. The whole is thus. If you will rely upon the word of one that neither fears God nor regards man, and lately proved him&s;elf &s;o fal&s;e to <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> you may qui|etly po&s;&s;e&s;s your e&s;tates, &s;o long, and no longer, than the tyrant plea&s;es. Whom he will he &s;lays, and whom he will he keeps alive. If he &s;ees cau&s;e to give your lands to his &s;oldiers, he will carry you to a land (and it may be) as good as your own: but it will not be your own. You will be poor and &s;trangers in it, and far from the holy land. Is this to better one's condition? But you may &s;ay, if I was the prime mini&s;ter of &s;tate in <HI>England,</HI> I &s;hould wi&s;h for a &s;urrender of <HI>American</HI> liberties, and we mu&s;t do as we would be done by. If you was as blind and infatuated as all tyrannical mi|ni&s;ters and in their place, you would, doubtle&s;s, do as they do. So, if you was a wolf, you would wi&s;h to have the &s;heep tamely &s;ubmit to be devoured; and if you was a devil, you would go about as a
<PB N="23" REF="015855_0021_0F9A2EA9A2770750">
roaring lion &s;eeking to devour. But this is not the &s;en&s;e of the rule. If you was a <HI>Briton,</HI> could you in rea&s;on, con&s;cience and honor, de&s;ire &s;uch a tame, unmanlike, da&s;tardly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in <HI>America?</HI> If not, then by this rule you cannot find your&s;elf obliged to &s;urrender. I &s;peak as to wi&s;e men; judge ye what I &s;ay. Weigh the premi&s;|es, and &s;tand up in &s;elf-defence, or yield your&s;elves as willing &s;laves, and entail bondage upon your children; who, perhaps, may ri&s;e up and call you cur&s;ed; but if you &s;truggle and are conquered, your own con&s;ciences will not reproach you, and your children may ri&s;e up and call you ble&s;&s;ed, on account of your faithful endeavours. And who can tell how &s;oon the tables may be turned? The great God may appear for us, and make <HI>Britons</HI> to know that the heavens do rule: that he who&s;e name alone is Jehovah is the mo&s;t high over all the earth. Let us do our duty and leave the event with God, who will certainly &s;hew that he rules in <HI>Jacob</HI> and to the ends of the earth, being king of nations as well as king of &s;aints, and will plead our cau&s;e. He &s;tyles him&s;elf a God that bringeth down high looks, and &s;aveth the afflicted people; and hath &s;aid, by &s;trength &s;hall no man prevail.</P>
<P N="3">3. Now, &s;irs, I reque&s;t your patience, hoping you will take a turn with me to the metropolis of that State, to which we were an|nexed in 1764, enter their cabinet, and attend to the &s;tate politici|ans. <Q>If the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grants on our northern borders were annexed to us, we might lay claim to their lands, and fill our pur&s;|es, by granting patents, and get a large &s;hare of tho&s;e lands into our hands. This will greatly impoveri&s;h the new &s;ettlements, and bring them low. We may &s;et up officers over them, that will promote our de&s;igns, and e&s;tabli&s;h courts &s;o numerous and expen&s;ive, as to be too heavy for them to bear: by all which many will become our tenants. We may enlarge the quit-rents, and hold them &s;ubject to &s;pecial writs from this chief &s;eat of go|vernment, and keep them low. Now is the time. Let us not con&s;ult them. They will oppo&s;e the motion here and in <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> But let us write to the king, and repre&s;ent it as for their intere&s;t to be annexed to us, and reque&s;t it as a favor.

<BIBL>JURE DIVINO.</BIBL>
<P>THE wicked plotteth again&s;t the ju&s;t, and gna&s;heth upon him with his teeth: the Lord &s;hall laugh at him, for he &s;eeth that his day is coming. A &s;nare did not u&s;e to be laid in the &s;ight of any bird. The new &s;ettlers are about their nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s, and are little aware of the pit that is made, and the &s;nare hid for them. But doth the cabinet afford no patron for injured innocence? Have the oppre&s;&s;ed no comforter, while on the &s;ide of their oppre&s;&s;ors there is power? Yes, beloved. For ju&s;tice &s;hall not be wholly run down, without a witne&s;s for it's injured rights. There was a <HI>Nichodemus</HI> in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> court, that could &s;ay as much for an inju|red, abu&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> as he ought to have &s;aid for the wor&s;t of cri|minals. Doth our law judge any man before it hear him, and know what he doth? And there was a <HI>Lot,</HI> you know, even in <HI>Sodom,</HI> that could plead the laws of friend&s;hip, and &s;acred rights of ho&s;pitality, on behalf of the two angels his gue&s;ts. Hear one then, even in the cabinet, that fears God, and regards man; is judicious, ju&s;t, and hating covetou&s;ne&s;s; that wi&s;ely knows that the exacting money for patents of tho&s;e that came hone&s;tly by their lands, is but picking their pockets at the expence of ju&s;tice; and that trea&s;ures gotten by deceit, or a lying tongue, are a vanity to&s;&s;ed to and fro of them that &s;eek death. <Q>Are you in earne&s;t,

gentlemen? Is it po&s;&s;ible? Can &s;uch policy as this be harboured a moment in our cabinet? Don't we all acknowledge a God that judgeth in the earth? And &s;hall not the mea&s;ure we mete to others, be mea&s;ured to us again? Will not a faithful Creator take their part, and have re&s;pect to the work of his hands? Shall we not &s;et the cries of the widow, the fatherle&s;s, and afflicted again&s;t our&s;elves? Shall we that now hate them in practice, get to be rulers over them? Hatred is often covered by deceit, but love is without di&s;&s;imulation. Let us follow the dictates of hu|manity and charity, and do as we would be done by. They have now already got as good a title to their lands, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> government can give; if this mu&s;t fail, other titles may be cal|led in que&s;tion, and the public faith be no foundation to build our intere&s;ts upon. Shall titles of lands fail, and private property be changed, by being annexed to a different government under the &s;ame king? Who ever thought of &s;uch a non&s;en&s;ical de|&s;truction of private property, by all the additions to <HI>Connecticut,</HI> or <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> from the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay?</HI> I had rather be confined to our pre&s;ent limits, than to have them enlarged by &s;uch gro&s;s deceit, iniquity, and inju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P>I SHALL leave it to you, gentlemen, to decide upon the premi&s;es; and only add, that the late governors and courtiers of <HI>New-York</HI> mu&s;t, as well as we, be judged by this perfect law of liberty; and all their conduct towards the&s;e plantations, be weighed in that ba|lance; and he that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is &s;in.</P>
<P N="4">4. Now, beloved, if you are not quite exhau&s;ted by hearing &s;o many hard and ungrateful things, I mu&s;t intreat you to retire with me, and let us hold a con&s;ultation among our&s;elves. Let us con&s;i|der, take advice one of another, and &s;peak our minds freely. The que&s;tion now to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed is, Are we obliged by the perfect law of love and liberty, to continue under the yoke of that &s;tate, to which with &s;o much inju&s;tice we were annexed? We mu&s;t be free with, and friendly to one another, as companions in tribulation: with a mutual fellow-feeling together, and a genuine tenderne&s;s for

our offspring; keeping all along in view the common cau&s;e of the&s;e injured and oppre&s;&s;ed &s;tates. We all know the woe pro|nounced in the word of God, again&s;t them that decree unrighteous decrees, and write the grievou&s;ne&s;s that they have pre&s;cribed; and that all the unrighteous acts in the world are in contempt of the God of judgment; &s;o that all the world ought to di&s;card them, if able to do it. Such arbitrary, unju&s;t acts, are never ratified in heaven. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that the open &s;ons of <HI>Beliel,</HI> that will endure no yoke, perpetrating their wickedne&s;s in contempt of all law; do not &s;o exceedingly provoke the Lord, as the mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice, framing mi&s;chief by law. The&s;e latter do in effect make the Supreme Ruler to &s;erve with their &s;ins, and u&s;e his authority again&s;t him&s;elf. Let us call in &s;elf-love to our aid, and our ju&s;tice and charity begin at home. We are chiefly from <HI>New-England;</HI> our genius and temper, and the laws we have been accu&s;tomed to are very different from tho&s;e of <HI>New-York.</HI> Hence it may be rea|&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e counties would have been three or four times as numerous, at this day, had they never been annexed to that &s;tate. And &s;hould we continue a few years more in that con|nection, and the quitrents be exacted according to the late re&s;olve of their convention, for the time pa&s;t, as well as now to come; we mu&s;t &s;oil our lands, if we can find buyers, at lea&s;t in part, in order to pay them. The encrea&s;e of our inhabitants will be retarded. But let us for a minute &s;et all the&s;e a&s;ide, and con&s;ider our di&s;tance from the chief &s;eat of government, &s;ome three, and &s;ome four hun|dred miles from the chief place of trade and bu&s;ine&s;s. How is it practicable for us to be repre&s;ented, in their a&s;&s;emblies, in any mea|&s;ure an&s;werable to the exigences of the&s;e remote plantations? A tender God enjoined his people <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Deut. 17. 14, on, to &s;et no other as king or ruler over them but (as it is expre&s;&s;ed) <HI>one from among thy brethren &s;halt thou &s;et king over thee: thou maye&s;t not &s;et a &s;tranger over thee, which is not thy brother.</HI> ver. 20. <HI>That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren.</HI> It is el&s;ewhere mentioned as a cur&s;e, to have them that ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e us to rule over us.

We look upon all to be &s;trangers that have no fellow-feeling with us; and all tho&s;e as our brethren, that are afflicted in all wherein the&s;e plantations are afflicted. Now, if you find your&s;elves obliged to think that the rulers of that &s;tate hare us, are &s;trangers to us, &s;tand aloof from our &s;ore, have forged chains for us, and lift up them&s;elves above us, not owning us as their brethren:&mdash;How, in the name of rea&s;on, can you expect they will a&s;&s;i&s;t us in opening a trade to the lake, in erecting tho&s;e mechanical works, that are need|ful in the&s;e remote parts? It is no plea&s;ure to me to renew your ancient griefs. But I mu&s;t drop a few words. You have the feelings of humanity; judge ye what I &s;ay. Is it rea&s;onable? is it ju&s;t? is it for the public weal? that an infant county, after the expence of a court-hou&s;e and goal, &s;hould have four county courts in a year, and to all the&s;e three or four times the number of jurymen be &s;ummoned, at the nod of a petty deputy-&s;heriff, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s nece&s;&s;ary? And if any, at two days warning, tho' without an hor&s;e and ca&s;h, do not attend, at the di&s;tance of thirty, forty, or fifty miles, and &s;tay the whole week, or till di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, upon their own co&s;t, while they have nothing, or next to nothing to do: in a few days almo&s;t the only &s;upport of their poor families, except bread, mu&s;t be &s;eized by the officer. Is this ju&s;tice? Is this to maintain the honor of government? Doth not righteou&s;ne&s;s, at this rate, &s;pring up as poi&s;onous hemlock in the furrows of the field? Doth it con&s;i&s;t with ju&s;tice, with mercy, with humanity, or with any thing laudable and prai&s;e-worthy, even among Pagans, to govern &s;uch infant &s;ettlements (or any other) by a law, in virtue of which a poor neighbour, at a &s;mall di&s;tance, may have his cow taken from him for a note of hand for three &s;hillings with co&s;t? Who that has one &s;park of humanity, but would &s;ooner lo&s;e a dozen &s;uch trifling debts, than to be the maker, or executor of &s;uch a law? But I could wi&s;h many pa&s;t things might be buried in oblivion, provided we might, with the con&s;ent of our neighbouring &s;tate, enjoy liberty and whole&s;ome laws for the time to come. Is it then? I appeal to rea&s;on, to con&s;cience, Is it the mind of our gracious King, expre&s;|&s;ed in this perfect law of love and liberty, that we continue annexed

So &s;peak ye, and &s;o conduct in this weighty affair, as they that expect to be judged by this perfect law of liberty.</P>
<P N="5">5. BE &s;o good now, my brethren, as to take a tour with me to <HI>Phi|ladelphia,</HI> and attend a few minutes to the grand council of the&s;e <HI>American</HI> States. We con&s;ider them as defenders of truth, ju&s;tice and mercy; the patrons of liberty, and advocates for the rights of mankind. We long to hear what pa&s;&s;es among them, relative to our affairs, and &s;hall watch to catch any thing out of their mouth in favor of our tranquility and freedom. But let me &s;tir up your pure minds by way of remembrance, that the&s;e our political fathers will &s;peak and act in character: they have no creating power to relieve us, but can do nothing again&s;t our liberty: yea, they may coun|tenance and encourage us that, if we may be made free, to u&s;e it rather.</P>
<P>IT is hoped di&s;cretion and prudence will guide us, according to the hone&s;ty of our de&s;igns in &s;o nice a point as our union with the&s;e States.</P>
<P>WE read of one of good under&s;tanding in the fear of the Lord; and that God's &s;ervant &s;hall deal prudently; and of a good under|&s;tanding, which all they have that do his commandments: and we find the fearer of God guiding his affairs with di&s;cretion. But we are as well a&s;&s;ured, that a great oppre&s;&s;or is void of under&s;tanding; and that oppre&s;&s;ion, or a temper and re&s;olution to oppre&s;s, maketh a wi&s;e man mad; &s;o that the wi&s;e&s;t coun&s;ellors of a <HI>Pharaoh</HI> be|come bruti&s;h in their knowledge.

Being hood winked by bribes, or blinded by pride, covetou&s;ne&s;s and a lu&s;t of power; they appear as much infatuated in their politics, as viciated in their mo|rals. Such may apply to the God of judgment to &s;ucceed their cruel plots, or to men in authority, to &s;upport, beyond their pow|er, their unju&s;t claims, but know not what they a&s;k of God or men;

and are as much lo&s;t to the dictates of good &s;en&s;e, as to the rights of ju&s;tice; but I hope better things of this honorable convention, and that a prudent conduct will be added to the goodne&s;s of their cau&s;e, and hone&s;ty of their intentions. How otherwi&s;e can we, in a rational way, and by the ob&s;ervation of all ages, account for that wi&s;dom, that has hitherto guided the chief council of the&s;e &s;tates; commanding &s;uch univer&s;al reverence, from them; as al&s;o from the wi&s;e&s;t men in <HI>Europe:</HI> but that they have all along &s;et the &s;upreme Ruler before them, and kept truth, ju&s;tice and mercy ever in view? You will then judiciou&s;ly con&s;ider, they can do neither more nor le&s;s, for us than as they act for all the&s;e united States. They may defend and e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of any parts or members oppre&s;&s;ed; but they cannot oppre&s;s, or hurt us. They may do good, but cannot do evil: as the apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>We can do nothing again&s;t the truth, but for the truth.</HI></P>
<P>LET us then attend to what pa&s;&s;es in that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, and wait a while for the i&s;&s;ue. Hearken! Who is this that &s;peaks? Is it a member from that &s;tate that has cau&s;ed &s;o much grief and trouble to the&s;e counties? We &s;hall &s;oon know by what he faith. How embarra&s;&s;ed! not by the dictates of his own rea&s;on, which might lead him to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of an oppre&s;&s;ed people, but in&s;tructions from his con&s;tituents, may have plunged him into this vi&s;ible confu&s;ion. A bad cau&s;e indeed, that cannot be defended without &s;uch perplexity! <Q>The three counties that de&s;ire the countenance of this board, as a new <HI>American</HI> State, were taken from <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and given, or &s;old to us by a royal edict: our then &s;o kind and good king was to have no &s;mall income from tho&s;e lands, by the large&s;t quitrents ever paid on the continent. Our convention, upon this turn of times, have re&s;olved them&s;elves to be all one a king, to receive tho&s;e quitrents, which will be all lo&s;t to our &s;tate, if they &s;hould be encouraged to &s;et up as a &s;tate by them&s;elves. Our convention, in June 1776, was &s;o kind to them, as to grant &s;everal companies of rangers for their defence, which calls for more grateful returns, than their revolting from our juri&s;diction. Protection calls for allegiance. It will be
<PB N="30" REF="015855_0028_0F9A2FA1D11A4FA8">
much to the injury of our &s;tate to be &s;o di&s;membered, and lo&s;e out dominion and tribute money. If &s;uch a rebellion again&s;t autho|rity &s;hould be winked at by this board, we may perhaps withdraw from it, at the call of our con&s;tituents, and &s;o break the happy union of the&s;e &s;tates.</Q> With as many more arguments as come into his mind, and as little to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>How forcible are right words, but what doth &s;uch arguing re|prove?</P>
<P>BUT we long to bear what is &s;aid by &s;ome impartial di&s;intere&s;ted member, that knows no man after the fle&s;h, who&s;e &s;oul abhors tyranny in <HI>America,</HI> as well as in <HI>Britain:</HI> and being in&s;pired with the feelings of humanity, cannot &s;tand aloof from our &s;ore.&mdash;<Q>Tho&s;e <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> Grants were never annexed to the &s;tate of <HI>New-York</HI> by their own con&s;ent, but as hor&s;es and cattle are &s;hift|ed from one to another by the will of their de&s;potic ma&s;ters. And their taking the advantage of the change, to put the poor people to the co&s;t of another title to their lands, was carrying the matter of private property, in this ca&s;e, further than many civi|lized Pagans have done, in ca&s;e of conquered nations. I &s;hould have thought, that no man that knew any difference between right and wrong, (meum and tuum) could have hit upon &s;uch a project to get money. And this convention appears to me an heavy burden, which they are no longer able to bear. And if the &s;tate of <HI>New-York</HI> have &s;hewed kindne&s;s to tho&s;e plantations, by granting money for about 200 rangers for their defence; it may &s;erve as &s;ome ju&s;t compen&s;ation for the injuries they have received. I would not expo&s;e any men or body of men further than ju&s;tice and truth oblige and nece&s;&s;ity urges; yet I mu&s;t &s;ay, on this criti|cal occa&s;ion, that (as I have learned) the convention of <HI>New-York,</HI> in that affair, acted in their &s;implicity, and knew not any thing of the circum&s;tances of tho&s;e remote &s;ettlements.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THOSE rangers were granted without the knowledge or reque&s;t of the people in tho&s;e parts, at the motion of one &s;ingle man who attained the chief command: and if any repre&s;entatives from the counties joined in the motion, it was chiefly from his repre&s;entation. And tho' both officers and &s;oldiers would freely
<PB N="31" REF="015855_0029_0F9A2FA28FD7A230">
turn out with the militia in tho&s;e parts upon any alarm, yet when under orders as rangers they were e&s;teemed rather a nui&s;ance than a defence, and innocently the wa&s;ters of the public money. And mu&s;t a people be obliged by a courte&s;y, they never reque&s;ted, and which was no favour to them, to be perpetual &s;laves to their mere nominal benefactors? I depend upon it, the people there know better than to purcha&s;e mi&s;taken favours at &s;o dear a rate. But &s;uppo&s;e the favour of tho&s;e rangers as great as was ever propo&s;ed, to barter their liberties for it, is to give a mo&s;t extravagant price. We all think the being bound by <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to an ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, too great a recompence for her protection. This mi&s;applied expence &s;hews that the divine me|thod is be&s;t, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that not &s;trangers but our brethren rule over us; that know our wants and circum&s;tances. Had <HI>Vermont</HI> then been a State independent of <HI>New-York,</HI> all the expence of tho&s;e rangers had been &s;pared. We find the <HI>Britons</HI> to be &s;trangers to us, and making gro&s;s mi&s;takes about us, when they meddle with our in|ternal polity. Colonies, at &s;uch a di&s;tance from their rulers, are treated with contempt. The rulers lift up them&s;elves above their brethren. And many things are done by the rulers which ought not to be done; and many things, which the public good requires, are ignorantly or carele&s;ly omitted. I &s;ee not therefore, but tho&s;e counties have a natural right to freedom, and a fair oppor|tunity to a&s;&s;ert it. For my part, I cannot but commi&s;erate their ca&s;e and feel for their pa&s;t &s;ufferings. I know the heart of the oppre&s;&s;ed, for I my&s;elf have been &s;everely &s;courged by that iron rod. My life has been threatned and endangered, for no other cau&s;e, but the &s;acrificing my intere&s;ts, and ri&s;king my honor and life, in defence of my injured, oppre&s;&s;ed country. Nothing gives me greater plea&s;ure, than to be happily in&s;trumental to undo the heavy burdens and let the oppre&s;&s;ed go free, and to break every yoke of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion. I rejoice to find in tho&s;e remote parts wi&s;dom and manhood in a&s;&s;erting their rights as men; and &s;o great a unanimity in the general cau&s;e. Let us encourage them. Their advancement will be the glory of the <HI>American</HI>

union. We hope to be free, and that all <HI>America</HI> will be &s;o, and the cries of the oppre&s;&s;ed heard no more, in the&s;e we&s;tern climes.

<P>IV. APPLICATION, by way of inference and addre&s;s.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>Infer.</HI> THE God of heaven doth wonders for an oppre&s;&s;ed people. The wheels of Providence are full of eyes; and there is often as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. He fir&s;t humbles and proves them, and then doth them good in their latter end. The God of grace knows his own thoughts of peace and mercy to a people, even while he &s;uffers a &s;pirit of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s to prevail again&s;t them. Maketh the ravens to feed <HI>Elijah,</HI> and bringeth meat to his people out of the eater, and out of the &s;trong &s;weetne&s;s. Had <HI>Great-Britain</HI> continued her protection and faith and ju&s;tice to the&s;e &s;tates, we &s;hould never have thought of a change at this time. Ne|ver were colonies more clo&s;ely attached to the mother-country, or royal family, than the&s;e now independent &s;tates. Not one in a thou&s;and among us, but was cordially well affected to <HI>George</HI> the third. Who but a wonder-working God, could &s;o &s;oon have united &s;o nume|rous a people of different intere&s;ts, in &s;uch an entire and e&s;tabli&s;hed alienation both from <HI>Britain</HI> and the royal hou&s;e? The <HI>Britons</HI> have been the in&s;truments. The way of man is not in him&s;elf. God left them to take &s;uch mea&s;ures, and per&s;i&s;t in them, again&s;t our petitions, and again&s;t the remon&s;trances of the wi&s;e&s;t men in <HI>Britain.</HI> It was of God to rend the&s;e colonies from the parent &s;tate, and wean us from it. So had we continued under
<PB N="33" REF="015855_0031_0F9A2FA40F5BEE38">
<HI>New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> we &s;hould likely, never have thought, at this time, of forming into a State by our&s;elves, whatever our oppre&s;&s;ors intend|ed. God has made them the tools of his providence, P&s;al. 9. 15, 16. <HI>The heathen are &s;unk down into the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is &s;nared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion; &s;elah.</HI> The two la&s;t words intimate that we mu&s;t &s;top, make a &s;olemn pau&s;e, and deeply con&s;ider &s;uch a wonderous work of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Infer.</HI> OUR pa&s;t &s;ufferings are adapted to make us tenderly affected one to another; and &s;o lay a foundation for our future peace and union. If this law of love becomes the fundamental principle of our &s;tate, we may differ in &s;entiment, without the lea&s;t di&s;affection one to another. Hence the exigences of any part, will be felt by the &s;everal members as their own. No man will live to or for him&s;elf alone, but as members one of another. So we may in the event count it all joy, that we have fallen into divers tempta|tions, as &s;erving to prepare us for future pro&s;perity and peace.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Infer.</HI> THAT all treacherous dealing, for or again&s;t the coun|try, is contrary to the light of nature, and the perfect law of liberty in the text. Trea&s;on in every &s;hape is abhorrent to human nature, and dete&s;ted among all nations, and in all ages of the world. We mu&s;t act openly, hone&s;tly and faithfully in all we do for the public; and never betray &s;o much as one private friend: be true and faith|ful in what we undertake, and never act under a cloak. I &s;carce ever read a wor&s;e character than that of Lord <HI>Lovet,</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> rebel, executed at Tower-hill 1745, "<HI>True to no king, to no religion true.</HI>" i. e. Di&s;&s;imulation and deceit, treachery and hypocri&s;y, unfaithful|ne&s;s and double dealing, were interwoven thro' the whole web of his conduct in religion and politics. We mu&s;t not turn traitors, tho' to &s;ave our country, or do &s;o great an evil that good may come. Dare to be true, to be hone&s;t and fair, and leave the event with God. This is the way to have the ble&s;&s;ing of God, and the favor of all men of true honor.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> had vanqui&s;hed his rival <HI>Mark Anthony,</HI> and was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the empire at <HI>Rome,</HI> he &s;ent for <HI>Herod</HI> the great out of <HI>Judea,</HI> who had joined his rival again&s;t him.

For is <HI>I&s;rael</HI> a &s;ervant? is he a home-born &s;lave? No, he is free born.

Here we mu&s;t begin, if we mean to comply with the text; and put away tho&s;e crying &s;ins that have exceedingly provoked the Lord to leave prote&s;tants to bite and devour one another. Our iniquities correct us, and our back&s;lidings reprove us; let us know and con&s;ider that it is an evil thing and bitter, that we have for&s;aken the Lord, the only hope of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and forgotten our re&s;ting place. The fooli&s;h people that bla&s;pheme God, and his enemies that take his name in vain, mu&s;t be reformed, and learn to fear that glorious and fearful name, the LORD our God. For becau&s;e of &s;wearing the land mourneth under the &s;ad tokens of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure.

<P>THE unanimity of the late Convention in calling upon us to fa&s;t, and cry to heaven for direction and help in our pre&s;ent affair, as well as the more public intere&s;ts of <HI>America,</HI> intimates to us a plea&s;|ing ground of hope, that this will be thy land, <HI>O Immanuel!</HI> That God will be openly acknowledged in all the important bu&s;ine&s;s of our State.

Civil rulers are God's vicegerents and deputies on earth, to maintain the honor of his rectoral righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and &s;o prevent divine judgments coming upon the people.

<P>AMEN. SO BE IT.</P>
<P>I CLOSE all with a few words to the people here pre&s;ent before God.</P>
<P>IT is a critical day with us. Perilous times are come. Let all unite for reformation and to promote the common cau&s;e of <HI>America,</HI> and good of this State. Whatever we might think heretofore, and however clo&s;ely attached to the mother country; we mu&s;t eye the hand of God in the change. God by a &s;eries of wonderous provi|dences, has made us independent States. We are now to &s;eek their good.</P>
<P>THE public faith of <HI>Britain</HI> now well known to us, and how far it is prudent to tru&s;t it; their per&s;ecuting us with a rage that reach|eth unto heaven, the in&s;ults offered to our under&s;tandings, as propo|&s;als for reconciliation, the deeply rooted and &s;o univer&s;al alienation of the&s;e States, from that kingdom; and our treaties abroad, which may (for ought we know) preclude all rational and moral po&s;&s;ibili|ty of a re-union; all the&s;e con&s;idered &s;eem to oblige us to be &s;o prudent for our&s;elves, as to think and &s;peak no more of that mat|ter; but to look upon the breach like the &s;ea, pa&s;t healing. We mu&s;t, it &s;eems, be their allies, or conquered va&s;&s;als, or have no con|nections with them.</P>
<P>LET us put away tho&s;e &s;ins that have armed our enemies again&s;t us, and be cordially united in all our efforts for the public weal. The cruelty of our mercile&s;s foes, &s;hould make us tenderly affected one to another. You may have heard of a man, a lamb, and a lion by chance falling into the &s;ame pit, &s;o touched with &s;ympathy and mutual tenderne&s;s, under the common calamity, as not to hurt one another. May the law of love, and that &s;pirit of chri&s;tian morali|ty, that runs thro' the &s;ermon on the mount, be cultivated among us: and O that all the powers of <HI>Europe,</HI> for our &s;akes, as well as their own, might be under the influence of that &s;ame &s;pirit.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="015855_0039_0F9A2FAA0FD84258">
WHEN &s;hall that glorious day appear when wars &s;hall cea&s;e to the ends of the earth, by the &s;upreme command of the Lord of ho&s;ts? Then <HI>Ephraim</HI> &s;hall no more envy <HI>Judah,</HI> nor <HI>Judah</HI> vex <HI>Ephraim.</HI> We &s;hall then very cordially unite with <HI>Britons,</HI> not indeed in civil connections, but in chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip, and amity. The wolf will then dwell plea&s;antly with the lamb, and the leopard lie down with the kid; and people both in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America</HI> try to render each other happy, as much as ever the one has &s;truggled to make the other mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>ALL the oppre&s;&s;ors, and tyrants of the earth, will then be gone down to the &s;ides of the pit, to lie with the uncircumci&s;ed, and their iniquities upon their bones; tho' they were the terror of the migh|ty in the land of the living.</P>
<P>THE greatne&s;s of the kingdom under the whole heaven, will then be given to the people of the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High, and the voice of the oppre&s;&s;or no more be heard. Civil Rulers will then be benefactors (not malefactors) and &s;eek the welfare of their peo|ple: and the people will love and not oppre&s;s one another. And in the peace of the civil community, and city of God, will every one have peace. Thy kingdom come, O LORD.</P>
