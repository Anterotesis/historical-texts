<HEAD>SHORT HISTORY OF THE YELLOW FEVER, <HI>That broke out in Philadelphia in</HI> 1797.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the end of July, 1797, the yellow fever again made its appearance in Philadelphia. It conti|nued to extend through various parts of the City and Liber|ties, for about three months. Towards the clo&s;e of October, &s;ome days of cold weather, or perhaps &s;ome natural cau&s;e beyond the reach of human conception, by degrees, abated its violence. Its ravages have now cea&s;ed; or, if a few re|maining patients can be found, they are only to be con&s;i|dered as convale&s;cents, and rare exceptions to the general &s;tatement, that the city is now re&s;tored to its u&s;ual propor|tion of healthine&s;s.</P>
<P>The citizens became more early aware of their danger than in 1793; and the &s;peedy flight of many thou&s;ands of them into the country, &s;eems to have been the chief cau&s;e why the mortality of this contagion has been &s;o much le&s;s violent than that of the former. By the way, though not &s;o generally known as to create alarm, it is true, that in the fall of 1794, Philadelphia had a tran&s;ient vi&s;it from this fatal &s;courge. A &s;mall number of per&s;ons, perhaps twenty or thirty, died of it. The unexpected intervention of one or two days of a wind more than u&s;ually cold for that &s;ea&s;on of the year, was the apparent cau&s;e of its abrupt extinc|tion. Perhaps the infection might be le&s;s violent in its nature than that of the former year. It is well known, that the plague, while remaining identically the &s;ame di&s;|ea&s;e, hath yet very different degrees of violence in its &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
<PB N="4" REF="032138_0003_0FF1531F6BF26978">vi&s;itations. In 1794, the &s;ickne&s;s was kept a &s;ecret by tho&s;e who had an opportunity to be acquainted with its having reached the city. The news was, on every account, unwelcome; and, happily, there did not occur any po&s;itive occa&s;ion for its being generally divulged.</P>
<P>As the con&s;equences of the pre&s;ent fever have been much le&s;s dreadful than of that in 1793, an account of it will be far le&s;s intere&s;ting; be&s;ides, the &s;ubject has lo&s;t much of novelty. The &s;ilent de&s;olation of our &s;treets in one year, di&s;plays a clo&s;e re&s;emblance to the &s;ame &s;cene in another year. But &s;till it may be proper that &s;ome compendious ac|count &s;hould be given of this calamity, that hath again &s;o abruptly &s;wept away &s;o many of our relations and acquain|tances.</P>
<P>On the 11th of Augu&s;t, 1797, the governor of Penn|&s;ylvania i&s;&s;ued a proclamation. He mentioned the intelli|gence of a contagious di&s;ea&s;e exi&s;ting in the We&s;t-Indies. He enjoined that every ve&s;&s;el from the I&s;lands, from New-Orleans, or from any French, Dutch, or Spani&s;h ports on the Main, &s;hould perform quarantine for five days, at the health-office, on State-I&s;land; or for &s;uch longer time, as the re&s;ident phy&s;icians and officers of the health-office &s;hould advi&s;e.</P>
<P>A &s;econd copy of this proclamation was i&s;&s;ued on the 15th of Augu&s;t, with the addition of "<HI>Briti&s;h</HI>" ports on the Main. On the 14th, the governor wrote a letter to Dr. John Redman, pre&s;ident of the college of phy&s;icians, re|que&s;ting a &s;tate of facts as to the origin and progre&s;s of the contagion. The an&s;wer, dated Augu&s;t 16th, &s;aid, in a few words, that "a malignant contagious fever has lately ap|peared in Penn-&s;treet, and its vicinity, of which ten or twelve per&s;ons have died." He promi&s;ed to communicate, as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, the advice of the college.</P>

It has been a&s;&s;erted publicly (and by tho&s;e whom I &s;hould have expected would have a&s;certained the fact, before cir|culating a report, &s;o ab&s;urd in its nature, and injurious to my character) that the above ve&s;&s;el was never examined previou&s;ly to her arrival, but permitted to pa&s;s, after en|quiring where &s;he was from!! The fal&s;ity of this &s;tory may at once be proved by referring to the files of the health-office, Philadelphia, where the u&s;ual official interrogatories of the captain of the Hinde are pre&s;erved, which are pro|po&s;ed to the ma&s;ters of all foreign ve&s;&s;els, at their arrival at the health-office, State-I&s;land.</P>
<P>The &s;hip Arethu&s;a, from Havannah, in balla&s;t, arrived healthy, and continued &s;o after five days quarantine, on the 24th of July, when &s;he came up to the city. She has al&s;o been accu&s;ed of infecting the people of Penn-&s;treet; but it has never been proved that any of the citizens who have died were nigh that &s;hip. The pilot, it appears, from imprudently &s;leeping on deck during the quarantine, was &s;eized with a fever on his way up to the city. Dr. Currie, his phy&s;ician, informed me, that it was attended with in|flammatory bilious &s;ymptoms, and that he was well in five days. For the &s;atisfaction of the public, I &s;hall make a fu|ture &s;tatement of the deaths on board this &s;hip during the voyage, before her arrival at the Havannah.</P>

I have &s;ince found that the Hinde lay very near to Pine-&s;treet wharf, and that the pilot of the Arethu&s;a attributes his cold and &s;ub&s;equent fever to &s;leeping in the cabin the evening before going to town, in a ham|mock, and to the rain which beat in through four win|dows upon him. Neither of the&s;e facts, however, will tend to prove the above ve&s;&s;els were concerned in producing the di&s;ea&s;e of Penn-&s;treet.</P>

<P>The following letter, from Dr. Currie, appeared in reply to tho&s;e above in&s;erted from Dr. Mea&s;e. They de&s;erve to be printed entire, as tending to throw light on the origin of the contagion:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the Citizens of Philadelphia.</SALUTE>
<DATE>Augu&s;t 18th, 1797.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>Doctor Mea&s;e, in his addre&s;s to the inhabitants of this city, has pledged his reputation, that "no per&s;on ill of the yellow fever, or any other contagious di&s;ea&s;e, has pa&s;&s;ed through his hands, from &s;ea, into this city, during the pre|&s;ent &s;ummer."</P>
<P>He has al&s;o mentioned, that I informed him, that the pilot who brought up the &s;hip Arethu&s;a, "had a fever, at|tended with <HI>inflammatory</HI> bilious &s;ymptoms."</P>
<P>From my knowledge of doctor Mea&s;e's conduct, and from the character he has hitherto &s;upported, with &s;o much credit, and even eclat, I have not the mo&s;t di&s;tant doubt that he has &s;tated facts preci&s;ely as they are, or at lea&s;t as he believes them to be. But, from the general propen&s;ity of mariners to &s;muggle; from the ridiculous and farcical pe|riod pre&s;cribed by law for performing quarantine; from the nature of infection; from the various articles of clothing and bedding being capable of retaining infection for a long time; from the neglect of ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els, (who are not aware of the con&s;equences) to throw overboard the clothing and bedding of &s;eamen that die on board their
<PB N="8" REF="032138_0007_0FF152F3E3AB0310">ve&s;&s;els; from the time, the place and the manner that the di&s;ea&s;e (which has lately appeared in this city) commenced and has progre&s;&s;ed, and from the mo&s;t perfect re&s;emblance of the fever to the yellow fever of the We&s;t-Indies, there can be no he&s;itation with tho&s;e that have a competent knowledge of medical hi&s;tory, in pronouncing the di&s;|ea&s;e, or the contagion which gave ri&s;e to the di&s;ea&s;e, to have been imported in &s;ome ve&s;&s;el from the We&s;t-Indies, though no per&s;on ill of the di&s;ea&s;e, had arrived from &s;ea with it.</P>
<P>And that the di&s;ea&s;e was introduced by &s;ome articles on board the Arethu&s;a, the following circum&s;tances render more than probable:</P>
<P>The &s;hip Arethu&s;a tran&s;ported fifty-&s;even &s;laves from Jamaica to the Havanna, &s;ome time in June la&s;t; and lo&s;t three men on the pa&s;&s;age with the yellow fever: to the truth of this, Mr. Philip King&s;ton, who was pa&s;&s;enger on board, has &s;ub&s;cribed; nor is it pretended to be denied by the captain or mate. The captain al&s;o omitted making re|port to the phy&s;ician of the health ho&s;pital, of a boy that died on board after Mr. King&s;ton left the ve&s;&s;el. The ve&s;|&s;el arrived at the fort on the 18th or 19th of July, with eleven hands, all apparently healthy; performed five days quarantine; left the mate at the ho&s;pital, where he re|mained twelve days, with &s;ymptoms of diarrhoea, or dy|&s;entery.</P>
<P>The pilot was conveyed to his lodgings in Shippen-&s;treet &s;oon after his arrival: I vi&s;ited him the next morning, and found him labouring under &s;ymptoms of high fever, re|&s;embling tho&s;e of the inflammatory kind, with a pain in his head and back; red eyes, tinged with yellow; had been delirious in the night; all the&s;e &s;ymptoms &s;ub&s;ided the day following, &s;ucceeded by great debility and &s;ickne&s;s at &s;tomach. The&s;e gave way to evacuating remedies, and he had no more complaint of fever after the 5th day. I &s;u&s;pected the ca&s;e, at the time, to be the &s;ame as the yellow fever of the We&s;t-Indies, which has been u&s;ually, but very improperly, called the inflammatory bilious fever; and in compliance with common language, in conver&s;ation with Dr. Mea&s;e, did mention that the fever was attended with inflammatory bilious &s;ymptoms, in&s;tead of inflammatory
<PB N="9" REF="032138_0008_0FF152D7901B5A20">&s;ymptoms, &s;ucceeded by tho&s;e of a bilious nature, which I declare was the fact, and ought &s;o to have been &s;tated to expre&s;s my preci&s;e meaning.</P>
<P>Five days after the arrival of the Arethu&s;a, while lying along-&s;ide of her, five of the crew of the Iris were at|tacked with &s;ymptoms of the yellow fever; all on the &s;ame day, or within one day of each other, and a few days after, two more of the crew: one of the&s;e, who&s;e name was Flood, died with unequivocal &s;ymptoms of the yellow fe|ver; among other &s;ymptoms, he had the black vomiting to a high degree.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts can be &s;ub&s;tantiated by unque&s;tionable evi|dence. I, therefore, have thought proper to make this ha&s;ty &s;tatement for the information and &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e con|cerned.</P>

<P>P. S. The di&s;ea&s;e almo&s;t invariably gives way to judici|ous bleeding and mercurial purges, when application is made &s;oon after the attack. The attack is generally &s;ud|den, and begins with pain in the head and back, accompa|nied with chills. The patient, though unea&s;y at &s;tomach, &s;eldom has any puking before the end of the &s;econd day. The di&s;ea&s;e terminates on the third or fourth day when properly treated. This di&s;ea&s;e may be effectually e&s;caped, by avoiding all communication with the &s;ick, and the hou&s;es where they have been &s;ick.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The college of phy&s;icians having attentively con&s;idered your reque&s;t "of giving an opinion on the be&s;t mode of averting the calamity which threatens us," have directed me to communicate to you the following methods: 1&s;t. For preventing the &s;preading of contagious di&s;ea&s;es when intro|duced among&s;t us, and 2dly. For preventing the intro|duction of &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. To prevent the &s;preading of contagious di&s;ea&s;es when introduced;&mdash;we recommend the mo&s;t &s;crupulous at|tention to cleaning and watering the &s;treets, particularly
<PB N="10" REF="032138_0009_0FF152D93062CB88">wa&s;hing out the gutters, habits of temperance, caution as to cloathing, fatigue of body, and expo&s;ure to the &s;un and night air. When it is a&s;certained that &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es exi&s;t, let the phy&s;icians of the city be enjoined to give in|formation to the board of health, to whom they &s;hould daily report &s;uch ca&s;es as may occur. Let all unnece&s;&s;ary intercour&s;e be &s;u&s;pended with that part of the city where the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appears. Let &s;uch of the &s;ick and their fa|milies, who re&s;ide in any part of the city where their re&s;i|dence may prove hurtful or dangerous, be immediately re|moved. When the di&s;ea&s;e is a&s;certained to exi&s;t in &s;everal hou&s;es near to each other, in any part of the city, let all the neighbouring families who have e&s;caped infection, be re|moved, and all communication between the infected fami|lies and the city be &s;u&s;pended, by preventing any per&s;ons except tho&s;e who&s;e vi&s;its are e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ick, previous to their removal, from entering into that part of the town. For this purpo&s;e, mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be &s;u&s;pended there, and the ve&s;&s;els removed from the adjoining wharves. All &s;u&s;pected wharves and hou&s;es, particularly &s;uch as have been occupied by the &s;ick, &s;hould be purified by order of the board, in the manner former|ly recommended by the college.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. To prevent the introduction of contagious di&s;ea&s;es, we recommend, that a new law on this &s;ubject be made, con&s;tituting a board of health, con&s;i&s;ting of five per&s;ons, including two phy&s;icians, of whom three &s;hall be citizens of Philadelphia, one an inhabitant of the Northern Liber|ties, and one an inhabitant of Southwark; who &s;hall meet daily during the months of June, July, Augu&s;t, and Sep|tember. They &s;hall have full power to do every thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary re&s;pecting the quarantine to be performed by ve&s;&s;els arriving in this port, as well as to direct the removal of any ve&s;&s;els, after their arrival at the city, which may be found or &s;u&s;pected to be unhealthy. A con&s;ulting and a re&s;iding phy&s;ician &s;hould be appointed; the former to dwell in the city, and the latter to be generally at the health office on State-I&s;land, from which he is never to be ab&s;ent during the above-mentioned months. Every ve&s;&s;el which arrives from the We&s;t-Indies, from the American Main to the &s;outhward of Florida, or from the Mediterra|nean,
<PB N="11" REF="032138_0010_0FF152ACA7A60A28">during the&s;e months, &s;hould perform a quarantine of not le&s;s than thirty days; and all &s;u&s;pected ve&s;&s;els &s;hould have every article, wrought or unwrought, which is u&s;ed for cloathing or bedding, or which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to contain infection, particularly tho&s;e which are compo&s;ed of cotton, wool and &s;ilk, unladen and purified at the i&s;land.</P>

<P>Hopes were &s;till entertained that the progre&s;s of the con|tagion might be checked. On the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t, the in|&s;pectors of the health office publi&s;hed an addre&s;s to the ci|tizens. They began with a&s;&s;uring the public that the infec|tion which had made its appearance in Penn-&s;treet and its vicinity, was &s;o limited in its extent, that, by proper exer|tions, it might, in their opinion, be entirely removed. They next publi&s;hed a &s;eries of re&s;olutions, to which was &s;ub|joined a note &s;igned by Mr. Dallas, as &s;ecretary of Penn|&s;ylvania: he &s;ignified the approbation of the governor. The re&s;olutions directed, that every per&s;on infected with the yellow fever, and who&s;e ca&s;e would admit of removal, &s;hould be conveyed by his friends, or the health officer, to a proper &s;ituation di&s;tant from Philadelphia. The ad|joining inhabitants were directed immediately to remove; a yellow flag was to be placed to hou&s;es containing, or which had recently contained, the &s;ick. No per&s;on, the needful attendants excepted, was to enter any &s;uch hou&s;e, till it had been properly clean&s;ed. Phy&s;icians were reque&s;ted to give notice of &s;uch contagious ca&s;es as came under their ob&s;ervation. The board farther announced, that a number of hou&s;es and tents had been procured for accommodating the healthy people who might remove from the city. At the &s;ame time, there was publi&s;hed a li&s;t of the in&s;pectors, being twenty-four in number, with the re&s;pective places of their re&s;idence. A note, of the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t, from their chairman, John Miller, jun. &s;tated, that &s;ince the 17th in&s;t.
<PB N="12" REF="032138_0011_0FF152DE810ADC68">ten ca&s;es of fever had occurred &s;outh of Pine-&s;treet, and mo&s;tly in Penn-&s;treet, of which &s;everal had been &s;ent to the ho&s;pital. Two others in the city had been traced back to Penn-&s;treet.</P>
<P>The new&s;papers now began to be crouded with publica|tions re&s;pecting the yellow fever. Dr. Caldwell, in a let|ter of the 21&s;t, &s;aid, that the report of the committee of health, exhibited but "a very faint and imperfect image of the health of the city, relative to the prevailing malig|nant fever." On the 22d, Drs. Dobel, Cox, Plea&s;ants, and Church were appointed to vi&s;it the City and Liberties, in que&s;t of new ca&s;es. On that day, only three were reported to the board of health. The Wigwam Tavern, out Race-&s;treet, near Schuylkill, &s;ome years &s;ince converted into an ho&s;pital, was made u&s;e of for the reception of the &s;ick. It was &s;aid that &s;ome dead bodies were removed from it, about this time, back into the city, for interment. If it was intended to &s;pread the di&s;order, a more apt method could not have been contrived. The idle parade of a number of people at burials, ought to have been forbidden, as al&s;o the cu&s;tom of ringing bells for the dead, which &s;erved only to alarm the &s;ick. However irre|ligious it may &s;eem, places of wor&s;hip ought to have been univer&s;ally &s;hut up. To a&s;&s;emble a thou&s;and or fifteen hun|dred people, of all ages, and from all parts of the city, into one place of meeting, in weather which was moderately warm, and during the prevalence of &s;uch a di&s;temper, was certainly imprudent, as it could not fail to promote the di&s;order.</P>
<P>Another mi&s;take was, the enduring of a public market in the mid&s;t of the city. This &s;pot was frequently, upon market days, &s;o crouded, that one could not walk twenty yards through it without jo&s;tling again&s;t per&s;ons on every &s;ide. Their very breath and clothes were &s;ufficient to convey contagion. This fever may well be termed a younger branch of the plague. In countries where the latter prevails, if as little attention was given, as has lately been exhibited in Philadelphia, to keep people at a di&s;tance from each other, the human race would, perhaps, in the&s;e parts of the world, be extirpated. It would have been very ea&s;y to adjourn the market to a &s;pot on the commons,
<PB N="13" REF="032138_0012_0FF152E8044FA728">where people &s;hould not have been under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;queezing each other in this way. Taverns, as another ve|hicle of infection, &s;hould have been di&s;couraged from be|ing kept open, unle&s;s &s;uch as were de&s;igned for the recep|tion of travellers from the country. The latter exception would have been nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ecuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the inhabitants.</P>
<P>The alarm continued gradually to increa&s;e: on the 23d of Augu&s;t, the board of health reported that fifteen new ca&s;es had occurred &s;ince the day before, and that the ut|mo&s;t diligence would be nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the di&s;order from &s;preading. The inhabitants began to move into the country; and, in a &s;hort time, they emigrated in &s;uch pro|digious numbers, that the city was &s;aid to be half empty. On every road from Philadelphia were &s;een waggons con|veying families and their effects to the country. Many merchants removed to Wilmington, where they began bu&s;ine&s;s. Germantown, Che&s;ter, Wilmington, Frankfort, Darby, Trenton, Bordenton, Ea&s;ton, and Burlington were more or le&s;s crouded with fugitives, who fled in every di|rection. Sometimes they carried the di&s;ea&s;e along with them; as in the in&s;tance of Mr. Robert Cary, glazier, who died at Burlington of the di&s;order; which, almo&s;t at the &s;ame time, cut off his &s;on Mr. James Cary, a clerk in the office of the Philadelphia Gazette. He had remained in the city, and was univer&s;ally lamented, as a young man of uncommon merit. So greatly was Philadelphia thinned, within the &s;pace of a week or two, that almo&s;t nobody was to be &s;een upon the &s;treets. Even of tho&s;e who &s;taid in town, many &s;hut them&s;elves up in their hou&s;es, as in &s;o many ca&s;tles, and entertained no commerce with their neigh|bours, unle&s;s when they ventured out to market; and that, above noticed, was a dangerous &s;ervice. Among other misfortunes, the markets grew dearer than u&s;ual, and &s;ome of the bakers made their bread as light, it is &s;aid, as when flour had been at fifteen dollars per barrel. We mu&s;t, how|ever, take into account, the very great ri&s;k which they ran, by &s;taying, upon any terms, in the city.</P>
<P>The appearance of the &s;treets was not, upon the whole, &s;o exceedingly di&s;mal as in the fall of 1793. Sometimes one met a cart driving at con&s;iderable &s;peed to Potter's
<PB N="14" REF="032138_0013_0FF1531014FC3528">field. The man who took care of it was frequently &s;inging. The dead bodies were not, on every occa&s;ion, very decent|ly put into coffins; but this is a topic too delicate to be en|larged upon. One cart broke down, above the corner of Che&s;nut and Seventh-&s;treets; and the body, which was not removed for &s;everal hours, annoyed the neighbourhood with a mo&s;t intolerable &s;mell.</P>
<P>An alarm had now &s;pread over the continent. On the 18th of Augu&s;t, the governor of New-York publi&s;hed a proclamation, directing that all ve&s;&s;els from Philadelphia &s;hould, till further orders, perform quarantine. On the 23d, the governor of this &s;tate i&s;&s;ued a proclamation.&mdash; He therein ordered that all communication &s;hould be cut off with the wharves, hou&s;es, and inhabitants &s;ituated be|tween Spruce and Front-&s;treets, to extend from the river to the we&s;t &s;ide of Front &s;treet. Nece&s;&s;ary attendants only were to be admitted within this &s;pot. Poles or fences were to be placed acro&s;s the &s;treets and avenues leading to it. The &s;hipping were to be removed from the wharves, and yellow flags to be placed at the corner of each of the &s;treets leading to the re&s;t of the city. An injunction was added for the removal of the &s;ick, if the ca&s;e would admit of it, and the inhabitants were al&s;o to remove upon orders from in&s;pectors of the health office. Yellow flags were to be &s;u&s;pended from the tops of the hou&s;es, wherein the &s;ick|ne&s;s had appeared. The phy&s;icians were reque&s;ted to give notice to the health office, of all ca&s;es within their know|ledge. A fine of three hundred dollars was to be impo|&s;ed on any per&s;on ob&s;tructing the execution of this order, or neglecting to pay obedience to it.</P>
<P>The latter part of this proclamation met with an imme|diate refu&s;al; for, on the very next day, the 24th of Au|gu&s;t, the in&s;pectors informed the public, that they could no longer tell whether any new ca&s;es had occurred, becau&s;e the phy&s;icians had not given them any communications. A mi&s;under&s;tanding had taken place: The doctors declined to name the number of their patients, becau&s;e the latter were liable, when di&s;covered, to be hurried off to the Wigwam in carts. This treatment gave general offence. Had a coach been employed for that end, as it was in the &s;equel, and &s;omething more of gentlene&s;s been di&s;played,
<PB N="15" REF="032138_0014_0FF152BEB935C080">the &s;cheme would have &s;ucceeded much better. It is here &s;tated, on re&s;pectable authority, that an Engli&s;h gentleman was hurried away to the ho&s;pital, although he offered five hundred dollars for leave to continue where he was, and although the people where he lodged were willing to have kept him. It is added, that he died &s;oon after his removal.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance is generally reported and believed, of a woman being hurried off, as in a yellow fever, and who next morning was delivered of a child. Very &s;trong ob|jections were made to the peremptory orders of removal, as both inhuman and impracticable. Dr. Caldwell, in a letter to the printer of the Philadelphia Gazette, of the 28th of Augu&s;t, inveighed &s;everely again&s;t it. He related that he had on Saturday, the 26th, been called to a patient. This man was &s;eized with illne&s;s on the Wedne&s;day preceding, and had forborne, as he &s;aid, to call in a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for fear of being conveyed to the ho&s;pital. He mentioned another ca&s;e of a man, who, when dying, &s;ent for him to enquire if any thing could be given to alleviate his pain. He did not expect to be cured, but had merely &s;ent for aid in the hope of obtaining a mitigation to the agony of his la&s;t mo|ments. Dr. Caldwell added, that many other ca&s;es of this &s;ort had occurred. He farther &s;aid that he had lately ob|&s;erved in the crowd of the court hou&s;e in Che&s;nut-&s;treet, three per&s;ons who, a few hours before, had been vi&s;iting patients ill of the fever. He had them called out, and per&s;uaded them to go away. On the 28th, the in&s;pectors adverti&s;ed that a coachee was kept in readine&s;s at the con|&s;table's office, at the corner of Front and Almond &s;treet, for the removal of tho&s;e who <HI>de&s;ired</HI> to be &s;ent to the ho&s;|pital, as al&s;o that a hear&s;e was kept at the &s;ame place. But it was more ea&s;y to rai&s;e an alarm than to &s;uppre&s;s it.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ure recommended by the governor, and like|wi&s;e the yellow flags, were pulled down, in &s;pite of the threatened penalty of three hundred dollars. Indeed, the be&s;t &s;afe-guard was the removal of the inhabitants into the country, which, of cour&s;e, crippled the progre&s;s of the contagion. Much of its violence may be a&s;cribed to the wretched practice common in Philadelphia, as well as in all other large towns, of jamming and heaping hou&s;es to|gether, as if the &s;urface of the country did not afford room
<PB N="16" REF="032138_0015_0FF152C1650543B0">for holding them. Nothing can be more completely ridi|culous, than that, in a continent twelve hundred leagues wide, and where land is &s;o extremely plenty, that conta|gion &s;hould be promoted by the narrowne&s;s of the &s;treets. In 1793, only thirty-nine per&s;ons died in the whole extent of Market-&s;treet, from the Delaware to the Schuylkill; whereas, in Pewter-Platter-Alley, containing perhaps forty hou&s;es, thirty-two per&s;ons died; in Elfrith's-Alley, twen|ty-three, in Combes's-Alley, twenty-nine; and in Mora|vian-Alley, thirty-&s;even. The&s;e make, in whole, an hundred and twenty-one deaths, in only four alleys. If each of them had been as wide as Market-&s;treet, the chance is, that at lea&s;t half of the&s;e lives would have been &s;aved. If Water-&s;treet, and &s;everal others, were near an hundred feet broad, the ravages of this dreadful di&s;order would &s;urely have been le&s;s fatal; as ventilation is an evident preventative. This appears from the di&s;temper having made &s;uch very &s;mall progre&s;s in the country. It would have &s;aved many lives annually, if every &s;treet in the City and Liberties had been thirty or forty yards broad, even if there never had been a yellow fever. In the hot &s;ummer months, Philadelphia is far from being a healthful &s;itua|tion, and to children it is extremely fatal. Two or three hundred additional acres of ground, which at the planning of the city was not worth twenty dollars per acre, would have &s;aved, by this time, thou&s;ands of lives. It is well known that previous to the great fire in London, in 1666, the plague had &s;eldom, if ever, been entirely out of that city. But after it was burnt, the &s;treets being rebuilt on a wider plan, that di&s;temper has never &s;ince been known to infe&s;t it.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tate met on the 29th of Augu&s;t, and, on the &s;ame day voted ten thou&s;and dollars to be appro|priated for the accommodation, employment, and re|lief of the &s;ick and indigent, during the prevalence of the fever. The money was acceptable and u&s;eful; yet, if the &s;um given had been even con&s;iderably larger, there was no want of objects of charity to receive it. The &s;tate is worth &s;ome millions of dollars, and an additional donation could &s;carcely have injured its intere&s;t.</P>
<P>A committee from the health-office were appointed to
<PB N="17" REF="032138_0016_0FF152B3615BCF68">vi&s;it the ho&s;pitals, at State-I&s;land, and the Wigwam, which they did on the 26th of Augu&s;t. They reported, that at the former place they found only thirteen patients; all of whom appeared to be on the recovery. At the Wigwam, forty-eight had been received, of whom &s;ixteen were dead, and mo&s;t of the remainder either cured, or in a &s;tate of convale&s;cence.</P>
<P>It has already been hinted, that a mi&s;under&s;tanding had ari&s;en between &s;ome of the phy&s;icians and the in&s;pectors of the health-office, in con&s;equence of which, the former had declined giving in any further reports of their patients.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the 29th of Augu&s;t, a letter appeared in the new&s;papers from Dr. Currie. He therein &s;tated, the rea&s;on for the phy&s;icians not giving in li&s;ts of their patients to the board of health, as ari&s;ing from want of time to do &s;o. He &s;aid, that it was the duty of the board to &s;end for &s;uch a li&s;t. He &s;ubjoined a catalogue of all per|&s;ons who had been infected, from the 22d of July to the 25th of Augu&s;t. On the 1&s;t of September, the number of hou&s;es &s;hut up, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be thirteen hundred and &s;ixty-five, be&s;ides tho&s;e in the inclo&s;ures of Penn-&s;treet, &amp;c. to which acce&s;s had been forbid by the governor's proclamation.</NOTE> On the 1&s;t of September, 1797, the board publi&s;hed a narrative of their proceedings, in con&s;equence of the governor's pro|clamation. They denied that force had been employed, or even contemplated, for the removal of the &s;ick to the ho&s;|pital; and that no &s;uch removals had taken place, unle&s;s when the attending phy&s;ician declared the mea&s;ure to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary. As to the former a&s;&s;ertion, the general belief is otherwi&s;e; though force might be u&s;ed, and undoubtedly was u&s;ed, by &s;ome agents of the board, perhaps with|out their knowledge. If the phy&s;icians had in every ca&s;e been con&s;ulted, they could have had no rea&s;on to be of|fended, as they certainly were, when they declined the re|porting of ca&s;es. The board further &s;aid, that all per&s;ons near the &s;ick, nece&s;&s;ary attendants excepted, had been ear|ne&s;tly advi&s;ed to remove. They mentioned, that the City-Ho&s;pital had been kept in a &s;tate of complete preparation for the receiving of patients; and that five phy&s;icians, Drs. Cox, Dobel, Plea&s;ants, Church, and Leib, had been ap|pointed in different parts of the city, to &s;eek out and ad|mini&s;ter relief to &s;uch per&s;ons as required a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="032138_0017_0FF152A1C909B880">After giving this view of the &s;ubject, the in&s;pectors ex|pre&s;&s;ed a hope, that all &s;ick or indi&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, as well as tho&s;e employed in the care of them, would &s;ee the pro|priety of an early application either to their family-phy&s;i|cian, to Dr. Duffield, con&s;ulting phy&s;ician of the port of Philadelphia, or to &s;ome of the medical gentlemen above named. There was a po&s;t&s;cript at the bottom of this notice, which mu&s;t have been the con&s;equence of &s;ome he&s;itation among the members of the board them&s;elves. It was &s;ign|ed by four members, who &s;aid, that during the con&s;idera|tion of this addre&s;s, they had reque&s;ted and obtained leave to withdraw. The burials at this time began to be more numerous. An account appeared in the Philadelphia Ga|zette, &s;tating, that, during the forty-eight hours preceding Monday, the 4th of September, at noon, there had been thirty-&s;ix interments.

<P><PB N="19" REF="032138_0018_0FF152DADA13A8C0">They invited the inhabitants to recommend in writing &s;uch indigent per&s;ons as might come within their know|ledge. The&s;e were to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by applying at the &s;tate-hou&s;e from three to nine o'clock in the evening, of Wed|ne&s;day, the 6th in&s;t. and thereafter, on "every 2d, 4th, and 6th days of the week, called Monday, Wedne&s;day, and Friday, while nece&s;&s;ary." The commi&s;&s;ioners, as above, were twelve in number, and their names and re&s;pective places of re&s;idence were printed, that people, during the rece&s;s of their meetings, in want of employment or relief, might know where to apply. Numbers of per|&s;ons were immediately &s;et to work upon the &s;treets and high-roads near the city. The funds were not adequate to give them full wages; and &s;ome of the over&s;eers told them that a whole day's work was not, of cour&s;e, to be expected from them. The reader may &s;uppo&s;e that no &s;uch hints were nece&s;&s;ary, for idlene&s;s is natural to man. But relief was e&s;&s;ential, and it was proper to find them employment, if only to divert them. Should their perfor|mances not have been equal to the expen&s;e which they co&s;t, &s;till it was fit that they &s;hould have &s;omething to do. Even &s;uppo&s;ing that only ten of them were di&s;hone&s;t, the temp|tation to robbery might have proved more detrimental to the citizens, than the whole amount of the expenditure; for &s;ome of them, after getting their wages, actually rob|bed one another. On South-&s;treet and Broad-&s;treet, the indulgence was taken in its utmo&s;t latitude; but when it is con&s;idered that &s;ome were emaciated, others delicate&mdash;and that many &s;oon got bli&s;ters on their hands, no great ex|ertions could be expected.</P>
<P>The contagion continued to extend. For the twenty-four hours preceding Saturday the 9th, at noon, the Phila|delphia Gazette reported thirty-two deaths; being about double the amount of any former &s;ingle day. From that time, till Monday at noon, the deaths were by the &s;ame new&s;paper, fifty-&s;even. On September 7th, the inhabitants of the Northern Liberties appointed a committee to a&s;&s;i&s;t the board of health. On the 12th, the commi&s;&s;ioners for a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing the poor, &s;ent a letter to the governor, giving an ac|count of their proceedings. They &s;tated that, from the 4th to the 9th in&s;tant, two hundred and eighty-four per|&s;ons, chiefly heads of families, had been relieved, at an ex+pen&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="032138_0019_0FF152F7F90DF8E8">of two hundred and &s;ixty-nine dollars and &s;ixty-five cents, be&s;ides a quantity of bread, the co&s;t of which an account had not been received. Two hundred and fifty men, at &s;eventy-five cents per day, had been employ|ed on the roads, and to open the cour&s;es of water in South|wark, &s;o as to drain the grounds. Provi&s;ion was further made for about two hundred people, who had removed to the tents on the Schuylkill.</P>
<P>On the 22d of September, a note appeared in the new&s;|papers, &s;igned by James Oldden, No. 1, South Sixth-&s;treet; John Gardiner, jun. No. 28, Strawberry-alley; Frank|lin Wharton, No. 268, South Second-&s;treet; John Clif|ton, No. 74, Swan&s;on-&s;treet, Southwark; and Thomas An|der&s;on, No. 63, Shippen-&s;treet, do. They &s;tated, that the guardians of the poor having generally left the city, they had voluntarily undertaken to &s;uperintend the poor, near Schuylkill; and had appointed David Thomas to be &s;teward, who con&s;tantly re&s;ided there. They notified, that tho&s;e who de&s;ired to remove from the neighbourhood of the &s;ick, to the tents, were to apply to them for an or|der, before they could be admitted. They reque&s;ted con|tributions of &s;traw, of old blankets, of children's clothes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In a &s;econd letter from the commi&s;&s;ioners, appointed to in&s;pect the di&s;tribution of money, to the governor, dated September the 18th, they related, their having, during that week, relieved &s;ix hundred and fifty-eight per|&s;ons, chiefly heads of families, with five hundred and nine|ty-five dollars and fifty cents, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable quantity of bread; that about 520 per&s;ons, who were thrown out of employment, and de&s;titute of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, had been paid at the rate of &s;eventy-five cents per day, for labouring on the high-roads, &amp;c. They had been obliged, from the &s;tate of their funds, to lower the wages to fifty cents.</P>
<P>In a third letter to the governor, dated September 25th, the commi&s;&s;ioners mentioned, that, &s;ince their la&s;t, they had relieved eight hundred and fifty-five per&s;ons. They had paid &s;ix hundred and thirty-nine men for labour on the roads; and including provi&s;ions for the people in the tents, and forty-&s;ix dollars and fifty-four cents for incidents, their whole expenditure came to five thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred
<PB N="21" REF="032138_0020_0FF152A844CA93E8">and eighty-one dollars and forty-nine cents. Some accounts were likewi&s;e un&s;ettled. Hence the total outlay came to upwards of two thou&s;and dollars per week; and, con&s;equently, the whole money granted by the legi&s;lature, being ten thou&s;and dollars, would la&s;t only for five weeks, or to the end of the one then current.</P>
<P>To remedy this deficiency, the mayor of Philadelphia was authori&s;ed, by an ordinance, to borrow on the credit of the Corporation, from either of the banks in the city, ten thou&s;and dollars; one thou&s;and were to be applied to the repairing of the high roads, and the remainder for the hiring of patroles, and &s;uch other mea&s;ures as might be nece&s;&s;ary for the protection of the city.</P>
<P>On October 4th, the commi&s;&s;ioners for taking care of the poor, addre&s;&s;ed a fourth letter to the governor. They &s;tated, that the weekly expen&s;e of &s;upporting them, came to upwards of two thou&s;and five hundred dollars. They had &s;ince their la&s;t publication, relieved a number of men, by employment on the roads, at fifty cents per day, to the amount of fifteen hundred dollars; other di&s;tribu|tions had come to the amount of twelve hundred dollars more. They earne&s;tly recommended private &s;ub&s;criptions for the relief of the poor, and &s;ubjoined a catalogue of do|nations already made. This is re&s;erved for a &s;eparate arti|cle, including the whole of &s;uch donations, as far as it &s;hall be found po&s;&s;ible to collect them.</P>
<P>The Merchant's Adverti&s;er of October 10th, contained another addre&s;s from the commi&s;&s;ioners. They began by &s;tating, that, on September 1&s;t, they had accepted of their appointment. They then received the ten thou&s;and dollars be&s;towed by the legi&s;lature, and which had gene|rally been &s;uppo&s;ed more than &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e. They found, upon examination, upwards of three thou&s;and people, of all ages, de&s;titute of work or &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The number had &s;ince greatly increa&s;ed, and the whole yet re|mained in the &s;ame &s;uffering condition. They next, in pa|thetic terms, addre&s;&s;ed the richer cla&s;s of their fellow-citi|zens for aid; and con&s;iderable &s;upplies were gradually pro|cured.</P>

<P>If a generous contempt of danger and of death me|rits the gratitude of mankind, that tribute is, on the pre|&s;ent emergency, unque&s;tionably due to the phy&s;icians of Philadelphia. The mo&s;t laborious, hazardous and di&s;agree|able ta&s;k was, in almo&s;t every in&s;tance, to be performed gratuitou&s;ly. Dr. Dobel, with a view to this contagion, had previou&s;ly made his will. He was of independent cir|cum&s;tances; had been married but a few months before, and could have no temptation for the office which he un|dertook, but what aro&s;e from pure benevolence.</P>
<P>Apprehen&s;ions had been, for &s;ome time, entertained by the &s;teward of the city ho&s;pital, that illicit practices were carried on at that place; after &s;ome vigilance, one of the attendants was, on the 12th of October, taken with a bag full of &s;undries belonging to the public. On a promi&s;e of forgivene&s;s, he confe&s;&s;ed that property, to a con&s;iderable amount, had been &s;ecreted in the hou&s;e of a certain John Brown, another of the attendants. A &s;earch-warrant was i&s;&s;ued; and the fact being proved, Brown was directly committed to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Before the middle of October, the mortality in the city began to abate. On the 13th of that month, the in&s;pectors of the health-office addre&s;&s;ed a note, &s;igned by William Montgomery, as chairman, to &s;uch of their fellow-citi|zens who&s;e families were then out of town. They were advi&s;ed not to return for a few days longer, becau&s;e, altho' there was an appearance of the fever having begun to &s;ub|&s;ide, &s;till they did not think it advi&s;able to return at &s;o early a period. They particularly cautioned citizens re&s;i|dent in the country from yet entering Southwark, and the lower parts of the city. They further advi&s;ed, that proper
<PB N="23" REF="032138_0022_0FF152B7B4C1E7B8">per&s;ons &s;hould, in the mean time, be employed to ventilate and clean their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Nothing, however, could exceed the impatience of &s;ome citizens to return. There had been complaints of extortion in tho&s;e &s;mall towns and places in the country to which many had retired. This is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that we may be cautioned, in ca&s;e Providence &s;hould permit Phi|ladelphia to be again vi&s;ited by a &s;imilar misfortune. That quadrupeds, birds, and aquatic animals, &s;hould prey upon each other, &s;eems, in many cla&s;&s;es, to have been the pre|vious de&s;tination of nature; but that human beings &s;hould practice the &s;ame rapacity again&s;t their fellow-creatures, is a very poor illu&s;tration of the pretended &s;anctity &s;o pom|pou&s;ly di&s;played by &s;ome of them. Many of the country people have gained largely by the city; yet when its inha|bitants came into their power, they di&s;covered what &s;mall reliance &s;hould be placed on their gratitude. Both lodging and provi&s;ions were often uncon&s;cionably enhanced in price. This extortion was &s;ometimes attended with much affected concern for the &s;ufferers, and many pleas of merit for giving them admittance on any terms whatever. To this account, exceptions were to be found, and this contra&s;t added &s;till more to the &s;hame of the inho&s;pitable.</P>
<P>As a relief to the &s;amene&s;s of this detail, we &s;hall here in&s;ert a few anecdotes which have come within our infor|mation.</P>
<P>Soon after the commencement of the fever, and while the inhabitants kept a guarded di&s;tance from each other, the bar-keeper of Mr. Wucherer's tavern, in Che&s;nut-&s;treet, happened to be abroad, fell into company, came home inebriated, and went to bed. Su&s;picion immediately took the alarm; and a doctor was &s;ent for, who pronounced his ca&s;e to be the yellow fever. The neighbours were un|der apprehen&s;ions for their &s;afety, and began to pack up their furniture for a retreat to the country. But next morn|ing unfolded their mi&s;take, by the patient's re&s;uming the duties of his &s;tation. Several loungers about Market-&s;treet wharf, were, like the bar-keeper, con&s;idered as having caught the contagion, and, con&s;equently, conveyed to the ho&s;pital. Some of them, perhaps, got infected in that place by the di&s;ea&s;e, as one or two paid their la&s;t debt to nature. Dur|ing
<PB N="24" REF="032138_0023_0FF152CDCA8BC0B8">this time, a volunteer patrol guarded the city. One night, &s;ome of them took up three foreign &s;ailors; and in accompanying them to their ve&s;&s;el, one of them, either to e&s;cape from the patrol or by accident, fell into the river, and was drowned. His body was found and buried next day. The committee of health requited each of the patrol with twenty-two dollars per month; and the latter have &s;ince been rai&s;ing a contribution from indivi|duals by &s;ub&s;cription, as a further reward for their own vigilance.</P>
<P>Tricks were played by &s;ome of the pri&s;oners in the city gaol. They feigned to have the di&s;order, were conducted to the ho&s;pital, and after partaking of a warm &s;upper, and a good night's lodging, di&s;appeared on the wings of the morning. Several who had been really attacked by the fe|ver, and others who had been &s;ent to the ho&s;pital again&s;t their will, by virtue of the governor's proclamation, in con&s;equence of the medical verdict of a &s;u&s;picious ca&s;e, fled, as &s;oon as they were able.</P>
<P>A Mr. Horn, a young German, had been about five days from Philadelphia, when he was taken ill in Northumber|land county, and died of the yellow fever. A remarkable cir|cum&s;tance is here &s;tated re&s;pecting his illne&s;s, on the autho|rity of his landlord, a Mr. Rittenhou&s;e. Such was the deceit|ful and flattering &s;tate of the di&s;order, that within two hours of his exit, he had no apprehen&s;ion of the approach of his di&s;&s;olution: he appeared &s;en&s;ible, though his continual theme was love; and he was planning his happine&s;s in a connu|bial life; but Death, in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace, triumphed over the fa&s;cinating de&s;ires of Cupid.</P>
<P>A Mr. Barry vi&s;ited the city, during the calamity. He had been advi&s;ed to keep his body open, as a preparative, in ca&s;e that he &s;hould be attacked. Accordingly, he went to an apothecary, and bought a box of thirty-two purga|tive pills.&mdash;From ignorance, he &s;wallowed the whole immediately, and was &s;uddenly taken unwell in the &s;treet, oppo&s;ite to the bank of North-America. A &s;ick-cart happened to pa&s;s by empty, and the drivers believing him attacked with the di&s;order, forced him into it, and were proceeding to the ho&s;pital. At the corner of Twelfth and Che&s;nut-&s;treets, one of the drivers quitted the cart. Anger or fright perhaps
<PB N="25" REF="032138_0024_0FF152BBC8C00938">had &s;topped the operation of the pills; for he &s;ummoned &s;trength, got loo&s;e, and beat the driver that remained. He led the man, his hor&s;e and cart to the City-hall, where he left them with many complaints of bad treatment.</P>
<P>Mr. Robert Longdon, a carpenter, at the beginning of the &s;ickne&s;s, had gone to Darby to work for Mr. Je&s;&s;e Sharples. Having come to town upon a Sunday, he was, on the following Thur&s;day, &s;eized with a chill, at Darby, and on Friday, the black vomit appeared. The family where he was lodged, left the hou&s;e, and he mu&s;t have died, if he had not with the fever, for want of nece&s;&s;aries, but for the humanity of David Ro&s;s, a young man who at|tended in the &s;tore of Mr. Sharples. Two phy&s;icians vi|&s;ited him on the en&s;uing Monday, and pronounced it to be a ca&s;e of the yellow fever: &s;alivation was recommen|ded; but the patient became delirious, and died on the &s;ame afternoon.</P>
<P>Mr. Sharples be&s;poke a coffin, and got his grave dug in the Friends' burying-ground, near Darby. The people of that town became alarmed: the grave-digger and cof|fin-maker fled through fear; and there was &s;ome danger that the corp&s;e might be &s;uffered to putrify in the &s;treet. James Ryan and David Ro&s;s, clerks to Mr. Sharples, along with that gentleman and a &s;tranger, went through Darby to the burying-ground, with the hear&s;e, every door in the place being &s;hut. This was about nine o'clock at night. The hor&s;e &s;tumbled, and fell, at the di&s;tance of a quarter of a mile from the place of interment. Both the &s;hafts of the hear&s;e were broken; and it was with great difficulty that the&s;e four per&s;ons contrived to drag the hear&s;e forward. On their return, every door was &s;hut again&s;t them, except that of Mr. Sharples. His two clerks, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the funeral, found it nece&s;&s;ary to re|turn to the city. Such were the difficulties which occurred not only to the &s;ick, but to the healthy.</P>
<P>The landlord of the Golden Swan, North Third-&s;treet, hired a hor&s;e and carriage to the board of health, for the purpo&s;e of conveying the dead to the burying-ground. One day, the driver &s;topt at a tavern: the hor&s;e, not being properly fa&s;tened, ran off with an empty coffin that hap|pened to be in the carriage; and returned, with full &s;peed,
<PB N="26" REF="032138_0025_0FF152AE831EA520">homeward. In pa&s;&s;ing through the yard of the inn, to|wards the &s;table, he was e&s;pied by the cook and bar-keeper. They in&s;tantly rai&s;ed an alarm that the hor&s;e brought home a dead body, in&s;tead of conveying it to the place of in|terment. Fame or calumny &s;oon after reported that two or three per&s;ons were dead at the Golden Swan.</P>
<P>Two per&s;ons employed by the committee of health, pur|&s;ued a man into the War-Office, whom a phy&s;ician had condemned to the ho&s;pital. The patient had been an old &s;oldier. He held in his hand a ru&s;ty bayonet, and kept them off. He had only been too free with his bottle, and would not be made a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Some have imagined them&s;elves to be attacked by the contagion, when they had only been intoxicated. One young man, an apprentice in Philadelphia, drank too much port wine. It returned from his &s;tomach: he mi&s;took it for the black vomit; and when he got &s;ober, he became delirious, through fear he &s;hould be &s;ent to the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t affecting circum&s;tances of death, was, in the ca&s;e of Dr. Jacob Thomp&s;on. He had been married in the evening&mdash;had gone to bed, and within two hours, felt the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;order approaching. The fa|mily were alarmed. The bridegroom was removed, and died on the third day, leaving his unfortunate wife, "at once a widow and a bride."</P>
<P>Dr. Plea&s;ants had removed to the country: philanthropy actuated his return, whereby he al&s;o peri&s;hed. Dr. Annan, another phy&s;ician, who lo&s;t his life, had, like Dr. Thomp|&s;on, been but newly married. David Thomas, of South|wark, fell an early and much lamented victim to this &s;courge. In the different and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive capacities of con|&s;table, deputy-&s;heriff, and as &s;teward to the poor at the tents, on Schuylkill, he had &s;erved with integrity, vigilance and humanity. Mr. Peter Helm, &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed in 1793, and who, upon this occa&s;ion, again offered his &s;ervices at the City-Ho&s;pital, was likewi&s;e attacked, but has &s;ince re|covered.</P>
<P>During this contagion, Wilmington became the general mart for trade over Philadelphia: merchants notified, in a joint adverti&s;ement, their removal to that place. Many country cu&s;tomers, however, went el&s;e here for their
<PB N="27" REF="032138_0026_0FF152A595259300">fall a&s;&s;ortments; in con&s;equence of which, we fear &s;ome will feel them&s;elves embarra&s;&s;ed to pre&s;erve that promp|titude, which has hitherto generally characteri&s;ed the mercantile hou&s;es of our metropolis.</P>
<P>Some of tho&s;e who were mo&s;t courageous in 1793, were timid, and fled among the mo&s;t early, in 1797. They had witne&s;&s;ed &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s then, that their re&s;olution now faul|tered. At the commencement of the attack, more or le&s;s of panic &s;eized every one; but tho&s;e who procra&s;tinated a flight, and &s;aw "Death's &s;hafts fly thick," were like &s;ol|diers in a battle, who, as we are told, cannot, at its com|mencement, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of terror; but, after balls have, for &s;ome time, flown over their heads, feel le&s;s apprehen&s;ion for per&s;onal &s;afety, and compo&s;ure and firmne&s;s generally &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>No &s;uch in&s;tances of general fatality occurred now, as in 1793. Then, according to Mr. Mathew Carey, a man of the name of Collins, buried his wife, his two daugh|ters, his &s;on, and his &s;on's wife, with her child; after all this, he got married a &s;econd time, before the clo&s;e of the fever, buried his new wife, and, to wind up the &s;cene, died him&s;elf. Such fatal occurrences being rife in the mind, people were happily impre&s;&s;ed with the danger of remain|ing in the city.</P>
<P>Drs. Hunter and Stafford di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by benevolence. The poor were invited to call at their &s;tores for medicines, which, with the general pre&s;criptions for the relief of tho&s;e infected, they actually &s;upplied, free of expen&s;e. Such in&s;tances of philanthropy &s;hould be record|ed not only here, but in the grateful minds of our citizens.</P>
<P>Among other per&s;ons meriting public notice, for their liberality during the di&s;order, two bakers, Chri&s;topher Ludwick and Frederick Frailey, ought not to be forgotten. They baked, gratis, for the poor, &s;everal thou&s;and loaves of bread, of flour furni&s;hed by the commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>On the Saturday previous to the meeting of the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tate, the Mayor expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ion of the progre&s;s of the contagion, to an a&s;&s;ociation of Friends, who &s;tyled them&s;elves, "a &s;ociety for improving the con|dition of the poor." John James, Thomas Wi&s;tar, Ed|ward Garrigues, Thomas Savery, George Pennock, Sa|muel
<PB N="28" REF="032138_0027_0FF1530B53EAE080">Garigues, jun. and Peter Barker, were appointed to apply to the a&s;&s;embly, as the funds of the &s;ociety it&s;elf were not adequate to the nece&s;&s;ities of the ca&s;e. Henry Drinker, &s;en. and Thomas Wi&s;tar, who were not members of that &s;ociety, joined them&s;elves to the committee. They waited on the Tue&s;day following upon the legi&s;lature, and the ten thou&s;and dollars were granted on the &s;ame day. The promptne&s;s of this grant merits con&s;iderable enco|mium. The Mayor had, from his office, peculiar oppor|tunities of learning the public di&s;tre&s;s. People's nece&s;&s;ities impelled them to &s;ue for debts, while tho&s;e who were &s;ued, pled in defence, the general langour of bu&s;ine&s;s, in con|&s;equence of the de&s;ertion of the citizens. Jonathan Pen|ro&s;e, late magi&s;trate of Southwark, and now &s;heriff, in a &s;truggle between &s;ympathy and the duties of his office, actually refu&s;ed to grant a warrant again&s;t a per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s, and ab&s;ented him&s;elf, to avoid the pain of being importuned to bring &s;uits for creditors. Towards the more advanced periods, however, of the calamity, the courts of ju&s;tice were &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>A grateful mind will recur with &s;ingular plea&s;ure to the recollection of tho&s;e gentlemen, who, after having encoun|tered, in 1793, every degree of toil and hazard, returned in 1797, to the &s;ame arduous and alarming duty. Among the&s;e were, I&s;rael I&s;rael, John Letchworth, Thomas Savery, Stephen Girard, Caleb Lownes, and John Connelly. Mr. I&s;rael had, in 1793, fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted, and afterwards a&s;&s;i&s;ted in promoting the plan of an orphan committee, of which he and Mr. Letchworth were active members. The latter al&s;o &s;erved in the committee of di&s;tribution. On the late emergency, they again officiated with eminent u&s;efulne&s;s; as did likewi&s;e Mr. Savery; who, in 1793, had been al&s;o a member of the committee of di&s;tribution. Me&s;&s;rs. Girard, Lownes, and Connelly now &s;uperintended the City-Ho&s;pital. In 1793, Mr. Girard had volunteered as one of the ma|nagers of Bu&s;h-hill ho&s;pital. Mr. Lownes, at the &s;ame awful period, was &s;ecretary to the committee for relieving the &s;ick and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, while Mr. Connelly acted in va|rious capacities. In 1793, he twice caught the contagion, and, as &s;oon as he recovered, returned to his charge.</P>
<P>The prudence of the commi&s;&s;ioners, in providing em|ployment,
<PB N="29" REF="032138_0028_0FF152DCCD2451A0">as well as &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the poor, &s;hould ever be re&s;pectfully remembered. The nece&s;&s;itous who were relieved, doubtle&s;s feel gratitude ingrafted in their hearts, to tho&s;e gentlemen who &s;tood to their re&s;pective po&s;ts, at the imminent hazard of their lives, to be their guar|dians and benefactors. What mu&s;t have been the feelings of the Board of Health&mdash;the Commi&s;&s;ioners&mdash;the Com|mittee, and In&s;pectors of the Ho&s;pital and Tents&mdash;the Over&s;eers of the Poor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph Galley, Michael Baker, John Smith, and David Graham, were the only per&s;ons, out of fourteen of the Over&s;eers for the City and Liberties, who adhered to their po&s;ts.

<P>One of the mo&s;t lamented victims of the di&s;order, was Dr. Nicholas Way, who, during 1793, re&s;ided at Wilmington, and was remarkable for his ho&s;pitality to the fugitive citizens of Philadelphia. He had &s;ince re|moved
<PB N="30" REF="032138_0029_0FF153222B0D3D80">to our metropolis, where his talents as a phy&s;ician, and philanthropy as a man, which his fortune enabled him to &s;upport, introduced him to exten&s;ive practice. Few men either lived or died with a greater number of friends, or a &s;maller number of enemies. It was by his &s;ug|ge&s;tion, that, during the late calamity, five phy&s;icians were appointed to &s;earch for and attend &s;uch of the poorer citi|zens as might be affected with the di&s;order. He was trea|&s;urer of the mint.&mdash;While the public lament his depar|ture, they will be plea&s;ed to hear, that that office is now filled by a gentleman, to whom they owe an equal re|&s;pect;&mdash;one, who, like him, could feel for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and always exerted him&s;elf to benefit his fellow-creatures.</P>

<P>Mr. David Evans, jun. was twice attacked. In the fir&s;t illne&s;s, he lo&s;t an hundred and twenty-&s;ix ounces of blood, and in the &s;econd, twenty-four. This account is given by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>About the middle of October, the Board of Commi&s;|&s;ioners, having con&s;idered that the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the poor would be likely to continue through the en&s;uing winter, opened a &s;ub&s;cription, to rai&s;e money for the purcha&s;e of wood and provi&s;ions, to be di&s;tributed in the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on; and appointed agents to buy up five hundred cords of wood, which has been purcha&s;ed, and is daily di&s;tributed to them.</P>
<P>As an in&s;tance of the malignity of this di&s;ea&s;e, we &s;hall mention, that a man from Baltimore, in a convale&s;cent &s;tate, called, during this time, at a &s;tore in Newca&s;tle, kept by Clay, Bond and Co. Mr. Clay and Mr. Shelly, of the firm, and Mr. Ruth, an accidental purcha&s;er, re|ceived the contagion, and expired within twenty-four hours of each other.</P>
<P>At Philadelphia, a dead body, &s;aid to be thrown from the Arethu&s;a, was found in the Delaware, &s;ewed up in a bag. Another body of a man was picked up, that had a note about him, &s;ignifying that he had &s;pent his whole money upon the doctors, without recovering from his
<PB N="32" REF="032138_0031_0FF1531465870E40">complicated infirmities, and that he thought Death was the mo&s;t certain relief. No evidence appears, however, that he was the writer of the note. Po&s;&s;ibly he might have been murdered, and that the perpetrator wrote it to elude &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>The College of Phy&s;icians recommended, in preference, as nur&s;es to the &s;ick, Negroes who were natives of Africa. This produced an inconvenience; for, the blacks of this country became alarmed, and generally refu&s;ed to at|tend; while the &s;carcity of Africans, made people bid high for them, and rai&s;ed, to exorbitance, the price of their at|tendance.</P>
<P>The practice of burning the clothes of the infected, mu&s;t, on &s;erious reflection, be viewed as highly improper. For, the pe&s;tilential air, ari&s;ing with the &s;moke, it is more than probable, aided by wind, might have a tendency of com|municating the fever to any one who inhaled &s;uch noxious effluvia. One gentleman, who was at a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance from the Ho&s;pital, ob&s;erving the practice, imagined that from them proceeded a di&s;agreeable &s;mell: be this as it may, he was &s;oon after &s;eized with the contagion, and now imputes it to that cau&s;e.</P>
<P>A gentleman in this city, who was attacked with the di&s;ea&s;e, immediately &s;ent for his phy&s;ician. By the ap|plication of the u&s;ual remedies, he was, in a &s;hort time, out of danger. But, though relieved from the fever, he &s;till remained under a deep affection of the &s;alivary glands. In con&s;equence of this, a ba&s;on was provided, which received the &s;aliva that fell from his mouth. One day, two young cats entered the room, unperceived by him, at fir&s;t, and licked up part of the contents of the ba&s;on. They were &s;eized, within an hour afterwards, with violent chills, and continued to wa&s;te away to mere &s;keletons, loathing all kinds of food. On the fourth day, one of them died. The per&s;on having experienced the good ef|fects of mercury, in relation to him&s;elf, &s;uppo&s;ed it might be of &s;ome &s;ervice to the &s;urviving cat, and accordingly gave her twelve grains. In a &s;hort time, to his expecta|tions, it operated, and the cat, before to appearance near|ly dead, &s;eemed to recover, and was, during the day, much revived. The medicine was not continued, and the
<PB N="33" REF="032138_0032_0FF15296781EDA10">next day &s;he drooped as before. The day after (the &s;e|venth) it died. The mother of the cats never left them while in this &s;ituation!&mdash;She appeared &s;lightly di&s;ea&s;ed, but did not die.</P>
<P>On the 13th of Augu&s;t, a man of the name of Peter Moli&s;is, late a &s;eaman of the &s;hip Hinde, was &s;ent to the Marine Ho&s;pital, from Love-lane; and died in two or three days. This was eleven days after the ve&s;&s;el was ex|amined. Al&s;o, on the 14th, another man, a Portugue&s;e, was taken from the corner of Penn and South &s;treets, to the Ho&s;pital, who had the fever, and &s;aid he had been landed about five days from the &s;ame &s;hip; another man, belonging to the Hinde, was al&s;o landed &s;ick, and lodged at the corner of Almond and Front &s;treets, at Mrs. O'Connor's.&mdash;He was, by the alarm of the neighbours, and his landlady, carried off from thence.</P>
<P>On the 24th of Augu&s;t, a meeting of a few citizens was held; who appointed a committee, con&s;i&s;ting of the following gentlemen:&mdash;Dr. William White, Dr. Nicho|las Way<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stephen Girard was appointed in the place of Dr. Way, after he died.</NOTE>, Nathaniel Falconer, John Connelly, Samuel Coates, and Caleb Lownes. The object of this a&s;&s;ociation was, to vi&s;it the hou&s;es of the &s;ick, and, generally, the &s;ick and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, for the purpo&s;e of admini&s;tering &s;uch relief, as their &s;uffering &s;ituations required. Samuel Coates was appointed trea&s;urer; and, be&s;ides an&s;wering the orders drawn by the gentlemen of the committee, he vi&s;ited with them the hou&s;es of the &s;ick, during the pre|valence of the fever. This early a&s;&s;ociation had not con|templated the exten&s;ive duties which the different rece&s;&s;es of di&s;tre&s;s unfolded to their view. The unwearied and di&s;intere&s;ted labours of the&s;e gentlemen, their po&s;terity may hear with gratification:&mdash;It may bring in view the unexampled character of the philanthropic Howard. With their pecuniary aid, they rai&s;ed a fund, without any &s;olici|tation, to the amount of about three thou&s;and &s;ix hundred dollars. With this &s;um, the &s;ick were a&s;&s;i&s;ted without di&s;|tinction to the City or Liberties.</P>
<P>An a&s;&s;ociation of young ladies, of the &s;ect called Friends, under the name of "<HI>The Female Society,</HI>" a con&s;iderable

The la&s;t mentioned committee gave them, to aid their views, two hundred dollars; thirty pair of childrens' &s;hoes, and &s;ixty blankets. They procured numerous donations from other &s;ources Di&s;tre&s;s plead not here in vain:&mdash;The chari|table&mdash;the virtuous&mdash;the religious, yet left in a corrupted city, may, we hope, avert the correction of Heaven.**** May the recording angel drop a tear, and blot out many of the faults inherent in our natures, that we may, by repentance, be &s;pared like Nineveh!</P>
<P>Mr. James Smith, merchant (brother to one of the firm of Gurney and Smith) re&s;ided, at the beginning of the &s;ickne&s;s, in the mo&s;t infectious part of the city. He a&s;&s;i&s;ted &s;trangers that were &s;ick, and particularly the poor, who were for&s;aken by their <HI>friends</HI>; helped many patients to the Ho&s;pital, and many bodies to their graves. He defied all danger that could ea&s;e the patient, or could render re|&s;pect to the dead. He offered his gratuitous &s;ervice to the Board of Health, to &s;uperintend the clean&s;ing of infectious hou&s;es. As &s;oon as he got his commi&s;&s;ion, the Board fur|ni&s;hed him with tubs, buckets, bru&s;hes, lime, &amp;c. and he recruited a black company, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty or thirty, and entered on his office. Every hou&s;e, in which he could get acce&s;s, where people had died, he purified. While he left &s;ome of the&s;e people in one hou&s;e, to &s;ee how others came on el&s;ewhere, they broke open and robbed the &s;tore belonging to it, of a quantity of goods, the property of the late hou&s;e of Richard <HI>&amp;</HI> James Smith, the former of whom had died. Here Mr. Smith had new trouble on his hands, in pur&s;uing, with con&s;tables, this &s;able, light-fingered groupe, and in arraigning them before Hilary Baker, our Mayor; who&s;e name we cannot pa&s;s over, without &s;igni|fying to di&s;tant readers, that he did not flinch from his &s;tation; but daily evinced him&s;elf to be that mild arbiter, which, in more tranquil hours, was a con&s;picuous trait in his character. Mr. Smith reque&s;ted that no addre&s;s or application on the &s;ubject of his office &s;hould be &s;ent to his hou&s;e, that his family might not feel unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions for his per&s;onal &s;afety.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="032138_0034_0FF152E9DE81AD58">Mr. Thomas Anne&s;ly undertook to clean&s;e &s;everal hou&s;es in Southwark, where people died, free of expen&s;e, except what actually accrued to him.</P>
<P>Mr. Samuel M. Fox, Pre&s;ident of the Bank of Penn|&s;ylvania, wrote a letter to the Board of Health, on the 22d of Augu&s;t, offering to lend them any &s;um of money that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> might want.

<P>At the clo&s;e of the fever, the Board of Health appoin|ted "a committee to purcha&s;e and transfer to Dr. Edward Stevens, to Dr. John Church, to the heirs of Dr. Benger Dobel, to the heirs of Dr. Samuel Plea&s;ants, to Dr. John Redman Coxe, to Dr. Michael Lieb, and to the heirs of Dr. William Annan, each one &s;hare of the &s;tock of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania, and that the transfers &s;o made ex|pre&s;s, that they are in con&s;ideration of the high &s;en&s;e the Board of Health entertain of the &s;ervice of tho&s;e gentle|men, during the calamity of 1797."</P>
<P>Dr. Stephens wrote a letter to the Board, politely de|clining the acceptance of the bank &s;hare granted to him.</P>
<P>The Board, on the 10th of November, re&s;olved, That their thanks &s;hould be pre&s;ented to Dr. John Duffield, for his &s;ervices, and that, as an acknowledgment for them, he &s;hould be pre&s;ented with a &s;hare in the bank of Penn&s;ylvania, transferred as tho&s;e to the other phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>On the 23 November, they al&s;o "re&s;olved, that their thanks &s;hould be pre&s;ented to Mr. James Smith, late of New-York, for his voluntary, di&s;intere&s;ted and benevo|lent &s;ervices during the late contagious fever, and that the &s;ame be publi&s;hed."</P>
<P>The Chairman of the Board, in notifying to the Gover|nor certain re&s;olutions, expre&s;&s;ed to him, that the Board are &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with the extraordinary labour and attention of Dr. John Church and Dr. Benger Dobel, in con&s;equence of their being &s;eated where the di&s;order raged with mo&s;t violence, that they would <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> have voted for each of the&s;e phy&s;icians a further compli|ment of a bank &s;hare, had their funds warranted &s;uch an appropriation.</P>
<P>The Board of Health e&s;timated their expen&s;es at about two hundred and fifteen dollars and forty-four cents per

<P>The impropriety practi&s;ed by the drivers of the car|riages that conveyed the dead to the burying-grounds &s;hould be noticed; &s;o that, in ca&s;e any &s;uch calamity might vi&s;it us hereafter, we may learn to improve by the blun|ders of others. Tho&s;e particularly who conveyed the dead from Southwark, frequently drove the carriage along the mo&s;t central parts of the city, in conveying them to the Ho&s;pital burying ground, in&s;tead of taking a direction towards the Commons.</P>
<P>While this is i&s;&s;uing from the pre&s;s, the river is frozen over, wood is dear, and trade is almo&s;t &s;tagnant. The nece&s;&s;aries of life, are, generally &s;peaking, at a higher rate than in 1793. Bankruptcies are as numerous as they were at the clo&s;e of the American revolution. When links to a chain are thus broken, we are, literally, on a boi&s;te|rous &s;ea. Thou&s;ands &s;uffer by the failure of hundreds. Our trade, being long cramped by the aggre&s;&s;ions of two oppo&s;ite powers, has rendered money &s;carce, and increa&s;ed the number of poor to an unexampled amount. Hence, though Death has not &s;natched away from us more than one-quarter &s;o many &s;ouls as in '93, yet we cannot, on a cur&s;ory view, find much contra&s;t in the picture of the two periods.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following letter will afford an idea of the &s;ufferings of &s;ome of the poor of the City of Philadelphia:</P>

<P>&rindx; The Li&s;t of DEATHS, during the months of <HI>Augu&s;t, Sep|tember,</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> the period within which the Fever was more or le&s;s violent, we have been careful to obtain, from the records of Mi|ni&s;ters, Sextons, &amp;c. and though we have li&s;ts from &s;ome grave|yards not noticed, through hurry, in the public papers, &s;till we do not find &s;o many victims to the contagion, as appeared to be the ag|gregate reported by the public papers.&mdash;We refer to the different &s;ources from which we obtained our information, for the authenticity of ours, in preference to others. Not, however, without liberally admitting, that it was owing to the confu&s;ed &s;tate of the people who rendered li&s;ts&mdash;the va&s;t trouble and time nece&s;&s;ary for daily receiving them&mdash;and blunders of grave-diggers, particularly their reporting that bodies would be buried at one time that perhaps would not be interred for &s;everal hours after|wards; and &s;o, perhaps, were enumerated twice. The&s;e ob&s;ervations we make, as a ju&s;tification for our accuracy, that naturally, by com|pari&s;on, might be called in que&s;tion.</P>
