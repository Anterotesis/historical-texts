<P>HE, who&s;e happine&s;s can admit no acce&s;&s;ion, and who&s;e perfect rec|titude excludes every degree of malevolence, mu&s;t de&s;ign the hap|pine&s;s of tho&s;e creatures he calls out of nothing into exi&s;tence; to &s;uppo&s;e the contrary is incon&s;i&s;tent with ab&s;olute perfection, and implies the wor&s;t of cha|racters.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="011071_0005_0F854BB6A09ECCB0">
THE communication of happine&s;s be|ing the end of creation, it will follow, from the perfections of the creator, that the whole plan of things is &s;o adju&s;ted as to promote the benevolent purpo&s;e; to which the immen&s;e diver&s;ity in his works; the gradation in the &s;pecies of beings that we know of, and many more perhaps than we know of, and &s;ome|what &s;imilar gradation in the &s;ame &s;pe|cies, ari&s;ing from their make, their con|nections, and the circum&s;tances they are placed in, are happily &s;ub&s;ervient. And every creature in the univer&s;e, according to its rank in the &s;cale of being, is &s;o con&s;tituted, as that acting agreeably to the laws of its nature, will promote its own happine&s;s, and of con&s;equence the grand de&s;ign of the creator.</P>
<P>AGREEABLY hereto, all beings in the cla&s;s of moral agents are &s;o formed, that happine&s;s will re&s;ult to them from acting according to certain rules pre&s;cribed by the creator, and made known to them by rea&s;on or revelation. The rules of action, conformity to which will be pro|ductive
<PB N="7" REF="011071_0006_0F854BB96BACE498">
of happine&s;s to <HI>&s;uch</HI> beings, mu&s;t be agreeable to moral fitne&s;s in the rela|tion of things; in perfect conformity to which the rectitude, and happine&s;s of the creator him&s;elf con&s;i&s;ts. And &s;uch in the connection and dependency of things, that happine&s;s will re&s;ult from conformity to the&s;e rules, not only to in|dividuals, but likewi&s;e to the whole; for the beneficial effects of &s;uch conformity are reciprocal.&mdash;It naturally tends to promote the order and harmony of the moral &s;y&s;tem and &s;o the general good.</P>
<P>THE plan of the creator being thus manife&s;tly adapted to promote the happi|ne&s;s of his creation, his conduct herein becomes a pattern to his creatures that are rational moral agents, and the rule of their duty, according to their mea&s;ure; for all moral obligation on &s;uch, indubitably, ari&s;es from the will of God, as there is &s;o exact a coincidence between his will, and the relative fitne&s;s of things; &s;o that the nearer they re&s;emble him, the nearer they will come to the perfect &s;tandard of right action, and the nearer they come
<PB N="8" REF="011071_0007_0F854BBA2425E418">
to <HI>this</HI> the more happine&s;s will be pro|duced.</P>
<P>IT being &s;o evidently the will of God, from the general constitution of things that the happine&s;s of his rational crea|tures &s;hould be promoted, all &s;uch are under moral obligation in conformity thereto, according to their ability, to promote their own, and the happine&s;s of others.</P>
<P>THE nature of the hu|man &s;pecies, therefore, being &s;o adapted to &s;ociety as that &s;ociety will afford va&s;tly more hap|pine&s;s to them, than &s;olitary exi&s;tence could do, indicates the will of their crea|tor, and makes it morally fit that they &s;hould a&s;&s;ociate. From the make of man, the di&s;advantages of a &s;olitary, and the advantages of a &s;ocial &s;tate, evidently appear. A &s;tate of &s;eparation from the re&s;t of the &s;pecies will not admit the ex|erci&s;e of tho&s;e <HI>affections and virtues,</HI> in which, from his natural con&s;titution, his happine&s;s very much con&s;i&s;ts; but in con|nection with others there will be oppor|tunity for the exerci&s;e of them. As
<PB N="9" REF="011071_0008_0F854BBAF7452F68">
each individual living in a &s;eperate &s;tate would be preventive of the happine&s;s for which men were evidently formed; and as this happine&s;s can be obtained only in a &s;ocial &s;tate, to form into &s;ociety mu&s;t be not only their intere&s;t, but their duty.</P>
<P>THE in&s;tinct, or propen&s;ity, implanted in the human &s;pecies leading them, as it were mechanically, to <HI>that</HI> to which they are morally obliged, is an in&s;tance of the creator's goodne&s;s as it facilitates the per|formance; and in the &s;ame proportion it does &s;o, mu&s;t make their neglect the more inexcu&s;able.</P>
<P>MANKIND being formed into &s;ociety, the moral obligation they are under to civil government will appear from the &s;ame principle, as being nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure to them tho&s;e natural rights and privileges which are e&s;&s;ential to their happine&s;s. Life, liberty, and property, are the gifts of the creator, on the unmole&s;ted enjoy|ment of which their happine&s;s chiefly de|pends: yet they are &s;uch an imperfect &s;et of beings that they are liable to have
<PB N="10" REF="011071_0009_0F854BBBB2A0FBB8">
the&s;e invaded; by one another: But the pre&s;ervation of them in every fit method is evidently their duty. The entering in|to &s;ociety lays the foundation of a plan for &s;ecuring them; but this plan will be. incomplete without the exertion of the united power of the <HI>whole</HI> for their mu|tual &s;afety; The exertion of this power for that purpo&s;e, corre&s;pondent to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">la&s;ting rules of right, is what is, here, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ended by civil government; and as this is a method the be&s;t adapted, in their power, to &s;ecure the rights and privileges necce&s;&s;ary to their happine&s;s, to go into it is morally fit, and evidently the will of their creator.</P>
<P>WHATEVER mankind are oblige to perform mu&s;t be within the verge of their power: The impracticability of the human &s;pecies continuing to be one &s;ociety for the purpo&s;e before mentioned, makes it necce&s;&s;ary and fit they &s;hould form into di&s;tinct and &s;eperate &s;ocieties, and erect civil government in them for that end.</P>
<P>UPON the &s;ame principle, &s;till, the na|tural
<PB N="11" REF="011071_0010_0F854BBBDFCDC4F8">
rights of one &s;ociety being in|vaded by the &s;uperiour power of another, &s;o long as the former are unable to a&s;&s;ert their freedom, it is morally fit they &s;hould receive laws from the latter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ending to their happine&s;s, as being the be&s;t means in their power to promote it, rather than admit a &s;tate of anarchy, big with <HI>con|fu&s;ion and every evil work</HI>: But from the&s;e circum&s;tances it is morally fit they &s;hould re&s;cue them&s;elves whenever it is in their power, only it may be as fit to u&s;e cau|tion, that by &s;uch attempts they do not plunge them&s;elves the deeper into di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>THE obligation mankind are under to civil government, in &s;ome form, as e&s;&s;en|tial to their happine&s;s in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, and perhaps not without its influence up|on their happine&s;s in a future, is not only deducible from the natural con&s;titution of things, but al&s;o &s;upported by written re|velation; in which it is repre&s;ented as greatly tending to their <HI>good,</HI> and there|fore an ordinance of the great benefactor of the world, who&s;e <HI>tender mercies are ever all his works.</HI> In the epi&s;tle to the
<PB N="12" REF="011071_0011_0F854BBE470C3EB8">
Romans, the civil power is expre&s;sly &s;aid to be <HI>of God,</HI> to be <HI>ordained</HI> of him, and the civil ruler to be <HI>the mini&s;ter of God for good.</HI></P>
<P>THE line, indeed, between one &s;ocie|ty, and another, is not drawn by heaven; nor is the particular form of civil govern|ment; as whether it &s;hall be conducted immediately by the whole &s;ociety, or by a few of their number, or if by a few, who they &s;hall be, expre&s;sly pointed out; but, as mankind are rational and free a|gents, the&s;e are left to their determinati|on and choice; only herein they are re|&s;tricted by tho&s;e rules which ari&s;e from the moral fitne&s;s of things productive of the general good, which they are ever bound invariably to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>NOR does the &s;acred &s;tory of the <HI>He|brew</HI> polity militate again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed order of things relative to civil govern|ment among men. The theocracy of the Jews, was an extraordinary vouch&s;afe|ment of God to that particular nation, but not counter to, orde&s;igned to alter, the general con&s;titution of mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="011071_0012_0F854BBEE54B0710">
THE right the &s;upreme ruler of the world has to be&s;tow favours upon <HI>&s;ome,</HI> out of the common cour&s;e of things, while <HI>others</HI> are left in the enjoyment of their natural privileges, can, in rea&s;on, no more be doubted, than his right to create one being &s;uperiour to another; for, though unknown to us, <HI>that,</HI> as well as <HI>this,</HI> may be in the original plan for the communi|cation of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and civil polity of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> nation, being under the imme|diate direction of God him&s;elf, was not only a &s;ignal favor to them, but al&s;o de|&s;igned to an&s;wer very important pur|po&s;es in his government of mankind.</P>
<P>THEIR civil polity coincided with the fitne&s;s of &s;ociety, and civil government among men, in all their &s;alutary effects, but the extraordinary manner, in which it was conducted, was never exhibited as a pattern to the other nations of the earth; but they were &s;till left to judge for them&s;elves, as to the form of civil government, within their power, that
<PB N="14" REF="011071_0013_0F854BBFA62C3398">
might be mo&s;t &s;ub&s;ervient to the public good.</P>
<P>THAT this peculiar form among the Jews was not de&s;igned to be perpetual appears probable, from the particular di|rections early given, by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> the &s;ervant of the Lord, to regulate the admini&s;trati|on of a king that &s;hould, from among, them&s;elves, in future time, be &s;et over them; and al&s;o by the revolution that in proce&s;s of time en&s;ued by more than the divine permi&s;&s;ion. After which the civil &s;tate of the Jews &s;ymbolized with the civil &s;tate of other nations.</P>
<P>THE Deity's conde&s;cending to be, in a political &s;en&s;e, king in I&s;rael, being a &s;ignal favor to them, as hereby they had a civil government better adapted to their circum&s;tances, and better contrived to promote their welfare, than they could have had by all the wi&s;dom of man, it mu&s;t have been impiou&s;ly ungrateful to reject him in that character, and de&s;ire that one of the imperfect &s;ons of men &s;hould be their &s;upreme ruler; and therefore de|&s;erving
<PB N="15" REF="011071_0014_0F854BC071B6BEE0">
the &s;evere reprehen&s;ion given them, by the prophet, under the direction of God him&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT though their inadvertent and ra&s;h de&s;ire was &s;uch an ungrateful re&s;ignation, and ju&s;t forfeiture of the &s;pecial favor they enjoyed, that God &s;aw meet to di&s;|continue it, and to cha&s;tize them for their wickedne&s;s therein, yet he did not withdraw the protection and ble&s;&s;ing of his providence from them in the exerci&s;e and enjoyment of the rights and privileges common to human nature. And if the alteration made at their de&s;ire, the extra|ordinary vouch&s;afement of the Deity apart had not been agreable to the natural con|&s;titution of mankind, and fit in the relation of things, it is not ea&s;y to conceive how he &s;hould &s;o far countenance the thing as to be active in &s;etting kings over them: And not only direct them in their choice, but al&s;o pre&s;cribe rules for the regulation of &s;uch an office, and ex|pre&s;s his approbation of, and afford his ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e who formed their admini&s;tration according to them.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="011071_0015_0F854BC1358E3480">
THE difference between them, now, and the other nations &s;eems chiefly to have ari&s;en from their religious &s;tate; which indeed had &s;till &s;ome kindly influence up|on their civil. In the exerci&s;e of their natural con&s;titutional rights relative to civil government, it was no doubt fit to &s;eek direction from him by who&s;e provi|dence kings reign. Their expectation of immediate direction from heaven was founded on the peculiar gracious di&s;pen|&s;ation they were under; and therefore the like could not be expected by any other nation.</P>
<P>No &s;et of beings can, in rea&s;on, &s;up|po&s;e them&s;elves wi&s;er than their maker; but mu&s;t think <HI>that</HI> to which he directs to be wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t; and, therefore, when they have certain notice of his plea|&s;ure re&s;pecting any tran&s;action of theirs, both duty and intere&s;t urge them to a compliance. And what nation of men on earth, in the exerci&s;e of this natural right, unalienable to any mortal, would not be glad of immediate indubitable di|rection from heaven? But when the
<PB N="17" REF="011071_0016_0F854BC2084825D0">
the&s;e &s;pecial directions are not obtainable, as according to the natural con&s;titution of mankind they are not, the affair being &s;o important to &s;ociety, and the happi|ne&s;s of the whole &s;o intimately connec|ted with it, it is fit that they &s;hould fir&s;t implore the influence of providence, which may be real, though not immedi|ate and &s;en&s;ible; and then tran&s;act it in the exerci&s;e of that liberty wherewith the creator has made them free.</P>
<P>EZRA's advancement to the govern|ment over the Jews did not, indeed, ori|ginate from their election, but from the civil power of that nation to which they were then in &s;ubjection; but yet, as their circum&s;tances would not admit of their exerci&s;ing all the rights of a free &s;tate, it became fit that they &s;hould chearfully acquie&s;ce in that appointment to promote their happine&s;s, as it was the be&s;t method in their power.</P>
<P>THEY were now emerging from the lowe&s;t &s;tate of depre&s;&s;ion; for &s;eventy years they had been unable to break the
<PB N="18" REF="011071_0017_0F854BC2A2502630">
iron yoke of captivity, and to a&s;&s;ert their national freedom. But under the favor of <HI>Cyrus</HI> part of the nation had returned to their own land, and were laying a|new the foundations of <HI>the commonwealth of I&s;rael.</HI> Their dependence on a foreign power, not only for permi&s;&s;ion to return to the land of <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> but al&s;o for pro|tection in the re-&s;ettlement of it, made it evidently their duty to &s;ubmit to a depu|tation from that power, with a view to promote their welfare.</P>
<P>AND <HI>Ezra</HI>'s being &s;ent from the <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> Court, with ample commi&s;&s;ion to &s;ettle affairs among them, eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and civil, according to their pri&s;tine form, was no doubt highly agreable to them, as he was of their own nation, and his qualifications were &s;o adequate to the im|portant tru&s;t, for he was a ready &s;cribe in the law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and well under|&s;tood the magna charta of their con&s;titu|tion; and al&s;o as he was a man of great piety, and virtue, and ardently di&s;po&s;ed to advance the intere&s;t of his nation: Who therefore could be more welcome,
<PB N="19" REF="011071_0018_0F854BC39C148D88">
who more likely to put things into a pro|per &s;ituation, and to promote the wel|fare of the community, the only worthy end of government?</P>
<P>THE kind reception he met with ap|pears, in part, from the early application made to him re&s;pecting illegal marriages in vogue among them, to which, the words I have read immediately refer.&mdash;The &s;tory &s;hows how ready he was to ex|ert him&s;elf for their good; his known character points out his qualifications for the purpo&s;e; and the united efforts of the people with him, to this end, with an acknowledgement of his authority, are ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the text: <HI>Ari&s;e, for this matter belongeth unto thee, and we will be with thee; be of good courage, and do it.</HI> And if we may be indulged to take this in&s;tance as a &s;pecimen of <HI>Ezra</HI>'s general admini&s;|tration, and of the people's friendly &s;piri|ted a&s;&s;i&s;tance through the whole; and as we go along to notice his di&s;tingui&s;h|ed character; the way will be open to turn our attention&mdash;to the part of civil rulers&mdash;to the qualifications of &s;uch&mdash;
<PB N="20" REF="011071_0019_0F854BC424F29E40">
and to the nece&s;&s;ity of the united exer|tions of the people with their rulers, to an&s;wer the &s;alutary purpo&s;es of civil go|vernment.</P>
<P>AND FIRST, The part of civil rulers, in general is to keep in view the end of civil government, and of their own par|ticular advancement, and to act accor|dingly.</P>
<P>THOUGH in the con&s;titution of things it does not belong to man to live alone, or without government in &s;ociety; yet he is inve&s;ted with certain rights and privileges, by the bounty of the creator, &s;o adapted to his nature that the enjoy|ment of them is the &s;ource of his happi|ne&s;s in this world, and without which exi&s;tence here would not be de&s;ireable. And mankind have no right voluntarily to give up to others tho&s;e natural privi|leges, e&s;&s;ential to their happine&s;s, with which they are inve&s;ted by the Lord of all: for the improvement of <HI>the&s;e</HI> they are accountable to him. Nor is it fit, that
<PB N="21" REF="011071_0020_0F854BC4ED2C3D50">
any of the &s;ons of men &s;hould take from others <HI>that</HI> which they have no right to give, nor by their mi&s;conduct have for|feited; though in this ca&s;e there &s;hould be mutual con&s;ent, the compact would be illegal, and both parties indictable at the bar of heaven.</P>
<P>CIVIL government among mankind is not a re&s;ignation of their natural privi|leges, but that method of &s;ecuring them, to which they are morally obliged as conducive to their happine&s;s: In the con|&s;titution of things, they can naturally have no rights incompatible with this; and therefore none to re&s;ign. For each indi|vidual to live in a &s;eperate &s;tate, and of con&s;equence without civil government, is &s;o pregnant with evil, and greatly pre|ventive of that happine&s;s of which human nature is made capable, that it could ne|ver be de&s;igned as a privilege to man by the munificent creator: And, perhaps, is not a privilege to other orders of ra|tional creatures, as much &s;uperior to man, in virtue, as in rank of being.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="011071_0021_0F854BC5D4B2BC90">
MANKIND may naturally have a li|berty to live without civil government in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e that they have a liberty, <HI>i.e.</HI> a power to neglect any moral duty: But they are evidently made dependent on one another for happine&s;s; and that method of action, which in the con&s;ti|tution of things, will prevent mi&s;ery, and procure happine&s;s to the &s;pecies, on &s;uppo&s;ition of their being acquainted with it, and in a capacity of going into it, is not only wrong in them to neglect, but even duty indi&s;pen&s;ible to pur&s;ue. From hence ari&s;es their obligation to civil go|vernment as mentioned before; and when the &s;ame rea&s;on urges the lodging this government in the hands of a few of the number a&s;&s;ociated, the &s;ame obliga|tion lies on them to do &s;o.</P>
<P>A COMMUNITY having determined that to commit the power of govern|ment to &s;ome few of their number is be&s;t, the right the &s;ome few can have to it, mu&s;t ari&s;e from the choice of the whole; for in this &s;tate the government belongs to the whole, and one has no more right
<PB N="23" REF="011071_0022_0F854BC6881411C8">
to govern than another; the right there|fore that individuals can have to this mu&s;t be delegated. This delegation is not in|deed the giving away of the right the whole have to govern, but providing for the exerci&s;e of their power in the mo&s;t effectual manner.</P>
<P>IT is by virtue of the previous con&s;ent of &s;ociety as being be&s;t, that government may devolve on &s;ome by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and that others may be appointed to rule by thoo&s;e already in authority.</P>
<P>A COMPACT for civil government in any community implies the &s;tipulation of certain rules of government. The&s;e rules or laws more properly make the ci|vil con&s;titution. How various the&s;e rules are in different nations is not the pre&s;ent enquiry; but that they ought in every nation to coincide with the moral fitne&s;s of things, by which alone the natural rights of mankind can be &s;ecured, and their happine&s;s promoted, is very certain. And &s;uch are the laws of the con&s;titution of civil government that we, and all

THE de&s;ign of mankind in forming a civil con&s;titution being to &s;ecure their natural rights and privileges, and to pro|mote their happine&s;s, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the &s;pecial end of the electors in chu&s;ing &s;ome to govern the whole, &s;hould be a&s;|&s;ented to by the elected to ve&s;t them with a right to govern, &s;o far at lea&s;t as to direct the admini&s;tration, without which they are indeed ve&s;ted with no authority; for the being cho&s;en to a par|ticular purpo&s;e by tho&s;e in whom the right of choice is, can give no rightful power to act be&s;ide or counter to this purpo&s;e. And therefore to the proper inve&s;titure of any in the office of civil rulers to which they are cho&s;en by the people, it is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould con|&s;ent to act the part for which they are cho&s;en; and this &s;ets them in the high office of government, and gives them authority to regulate the whole.</P>
<P>THEIR con&s;ent to take the office to which they are cho&s;en by the communi|ty lays rulers under a moral obligation to di&s;charge the duties of it with fidelity.

And if for the greater &s;ecurity of &s;ociety, they who are thus introduced into office are bound to the faithful di&s;charge of it by the &s;olemnity of an oath, their obliga|tion hereto is the greater.</P>
<P>WHAT is right in the relation of things, and which has the general con&s;ent of mankind, being the rule of civil govern|ment in a well con&s;tituted &s;tate, civil rulers are to be &s;o far from invading, that they ought to be the guardians of the natural and con&s;titutional rights of their &s;ubjects; which are here &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o nearly the &s;ame that there is no interfering between them.

<P>THE various duties of their office then centre in one point, the end of their elec|tion, and that is to promote the public welfare.</P>
<P>MINUTELY to enumerate the&s;e duties is no indeed pretended, not only as it would take up too much time, but

al&s;o as the wi&s;dom of the politician can better apply general rules to particular ca&s;es as cimcum&s;tances vary; I therefore &s;hall take the liberty only in a more ge|neral way to ob&s;erve: That whatever is injurious to the community, whether foreign or inte&s;tine, is theirs to endeavor to prevent. In this &s;tate of imperfection and &s;in, particular &s;ocieties are liable to injuries from one another, hence vigilance becomes one part of the duty of civil rulers; to this they are more obliged than other men: In office they are as eyes to the political body, the proper u&s;e of which is nece&s;&s;ary to its &s;afety. It is no &s;mall part of their care to de&s;ery danger, to pe|netrate the de&s;igns formed abroad to the detriment of the community. And as
they are &s;et for the public defence, when &s;uch dangers are di&s;covered by them, it is their part to provide again&s;t them at the public expence; which mu&s;t be in their power at all times, or at &s;ome times it may not be in their power to act in the character of guardians to the public.

<P>AND whatever is for the advantage and emolument of &s;ociety, is al&s;o their part to promote, not only barely to &s;e|cure to their &s;ubjects the cardinal privile|ges of human nature, but al&s;o kindly en|deavour to heighten their happine&s;s in the enjoyment of them. Tho&s;e methods which will be mo&s;t conducive to the pre|servation and pro&s;perity of the <HI>whole</HI> are to be &s;tudiou&s;ly devi&s;ed, and faithfully urged by them; hence agriculture and commerce, liberal and mechanical arts &s;hould be encouraged, as pointed out in providence for the benefit of mankind; in proportion to improvement in which will be the benefit re&s;ulting from them, by which a &s;upply may be obtained not only for nece&s;&s;ity, but al&s;o for delight; and hereby their political &s;trength will be increa&s;ed, and they become more able to &s;upport the common cau&s;e.

<P>THE civil power al&s;o &s;hould be exer|ted to &s;uppre&s;s vice as pregnant with mi&s;|chief to &s;ociety; and to &s;upport virtue as the foundation of &s;ocial happine&s;s.</P>

THAT public homage which the com|munity owe to the great Lord of all; and which is equally their intere&s;t as their duty to pay, &s;hould be earne&s;tly promo|ted by their rulers.

<P>THE great advantages acruing from the public &s;ocial wor&s;hip of the Deity may be a laudable motive to civil rulers to exert them&s;elves to promote it; and will have an influence on them who have the pub|lic good at heart, as well as a proper &s;en&s;e of duty to him, who <HI>is higher than the highe&s;t</HI>: In this way, while the mini&s;|ters of religion are under the patronage of the civil power, the people will be in &s;tructed in tho&s;e principles, and urged to

tho&s;e practices, which will greatly &s;ub|&s;erve the intere&s;t of the community, and facilitate the end of government.</P>
<P>EZRA'S commi&s;&s;ion extended to church as well as &s;tate; and there is indeed &s;uch a connection between them, and their intere&s;t is &s;o dependent upon each other, that the welfare of the community ari&s;es from things going <HI>well</HI> in both; and therefore both, though with &s;uch re&s;tric|tions as their re&s;pective nature requires, claim the attention and care of the civil rulers of a people, who&s;e duty it is to pro|tect, and fo&s;ter their &s;ubjects in the enjoy|ment of their religious rights and privile|ges, as well as civil, and upon the &s;ame principle of promoting their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is therefore the part of civil rulers to make, and as occa&s;ion &s;hall offer, to execute &s;uch laws as tend to promote the public welfare. <HI>The&s;e</HI> indeed are in &s;ome mea&s;ure to be varied, according to the temper and circum&s;tances of the &s;ub|jects, by the wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lators; but yet it is nece&s;&s;ary there &s;hould be in them

a conformity to the immutable laws of nature, to an&s;wer the true de&s;ign of civil in&s;titution.</P>
<P>To the&s;e laws it is fit they &s;hould add &s;uch &s;anctions as will give them energy if they are &s;uitably applied by tho&s;e in civil office who&s;e part it is to put the laws into execution.</P>
<P>PROVIDED always, that no laws be made inva&s;ive of the natural rights of con&s;cience, and no penalties inflicted by the civil power in things purely religious, and which do not affect the well being of the &s;tate: In <HI>the&s;e,</HI> every man has an un|alienable right, in the con&s;titution of things, to judge for him&s;elf: No man, and no number of men therefore have a right to a&s;&s;ume juri&s;diction here.</P>
<P>ON the free exerci&s;e of their natural religious rights the pre&s;ent as well as fu|ture happine&s;s of mankind greatly de|pends; the abridgement of which by pe|nal laws is evidently incongruous to the eternal rules of equity; but the&s;e rules
<PB N="33" REF="011071_0032_0F854BCDE0D77498">
are never to be violated in the exerci&s;e of civil power. Civil laws, of right, can relate only to tho&s;e actions which have influence on the welfare of the &s;tate; and to all <HI>&s;uch</HI> the &s;ubject may be urged by the civil authority con&s;i&s;tently with that freedom of mind, in judging of points of &s;peculation, and that liberty of con|&s;cience relative to modes of wor&s;hip, which he has a natural right unmole&s;ted to enjoy.</P>
<P>OBLIGATION on civil rulers to &s;ecure the rights and promote the happine&s;s of the people, mo&s;t certainly implies a power in them to that purpo&s;e, &mdash;to make laws and execute them; without which, ruler is but an empty name: To this purpo&s;e they are indeed cloathed with authority, and armed with the united power of the community; only in the exerci&s;e of this power they are under the &s;ame moral re|&s;trictions with tho&s;e by whom it was de|legated to them.</P>
<P>As in a well con&s;tituted civil &s;tate there is a &s;ubordination among rulers, and each has his re&s;pective part to act
<PB N="34" REF="011071_0033_0F854BD011BA5868">

<P>NOR is the influence, the example of rulers will, in high probility, have upon others, unimportant to &s;ociety: Facts de|mon&s;trate examples to be very forcible on human nature.

the virtuous to the vicious for their rulers.</P>
<P>BUT the goodne&s;s of the heart influen|tial on the life, without di&s;cernment in the heart, will yet leave civil rulers &s;hort of a qualification nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;charge the duties of their office. Men may be pious and virtuous and yet not capable of pene|trating very far into the nature and con|nection of things, and therefore unequal to tran&s;actions which require more than common abilites.</P>
<P>THE natural and acquired accompli&s;h|ments of mankind are various, all an|&s;wering good purpo&s;es in their re&s;pective &s;ituations, and &s;ub&s;ervient to the general good; and in proportion to <HI>the&s;e</HI> they are qualified for different employments.

It is not Indeed of &s;o much importance how they come by their qualifications, whether by <HI>le&s;s</HI> or <HI>greater</HI> application, as that they are really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it; on <HI>this</HI> in no &s;mall degree the welfare of &s;o|ciety depends.

<P>CAPACITY for po&s;ts of public tru&s;t without virtuous principles is indeed pre|carious, and not &s;afely to be depended on; but when probity and wi&s;dom unite in the &s;ame per&s;on they form a character that tends greatly to &s;upport the confi|dence,

<P>A SACRED regard to civil authority, according to the true de&s;ign of it, is to be cultivated in all; and as a means na|turally tending to this, including the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of divine influence in their ard|uous, and benevolent work, it is directed by the &s;upreme law-giver, <HI>that &s;upplica|tions, and prayers, interce&s;&s;ions, and giv|ing of thanks be made&mdash;for kings, and for all that an in authority, that we may lead a

<P>To keep up veneration for rulers, is to keep up a regard to government it&s;elf in the community, and to open the way for its happier influence. Honor there|fore &s;hould be rendered to them to whom it is due for the good &s;ervices they have already done, and as being the way to give them opportunity of doing more, and to &s;timulate them to improve the opportunity by the vigorous exertions of their abilities to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT &s;till and more e&s;pecially, the uni|ted efforts of the people with their ru|lers are nece&s;&s;ary to the putting tho&s;e laws into execution that are made for the good of the community.</P>
<P>IT is here &s;uppo&s;ed, that the laws made by civil rulers coincide with moral fitne&s;s, and are calculated to an&s;wer the end for which only they are impowered to make laws; if otherwi&s;e, the &s;ubject can be under no obligation to ob&s;erve them; but may be morally obliged to re|&s;i&s;t

But though with the highe&s;t propriety this doctrine may be exploded, it does not at all le&s;&s;en the moral obligation of obedi|ence in the people to an equitable admini|&s;tration; and to u&s;e their endeavours that the laws made by their rulers to promote the good of the community &s;hould take place to that purpo&s;e: This is only the continued exertion of that power which is nece&s;&s;ary to carry into effect the plan of civil government laid by them&s;elves, and without which the be&s;t laws will fall &s;hort of it.

IT is therefore plain, that the united efforts of the people are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;up|port civil government, and make it effi|cacious to the great and happy end for which it was in&s;tituted: And as rulers are holden by the &s;tronge&s;t ties to con&s;ult and endeavour the welfare of the people; the <HI>people</HI> are equally bound to aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the&s;e endeavours.</P>
<P>WHAT has been imperfectly &s;ugge&s;|ted in this di&s;cour&s;e may lead to, &s;ome re|flections on the goodne&s;s of the &s;upreme ruler of the world, to mankind in general and to our&s;elves in particular, in the pre|&s;ent &s;tate, more e&s;pecially as expre&s;&s;ed in the in&s;titution of civil government: And give occa&s;ion to urge the attention of ru|lers and people to the duties of their re&s;pective &s;tations.</P>
<P>THE goodne&s;s of the Creator appears through all his works, but more illu&s;tri|ou&s;ly to man than to any other creature on this earth; him he hath &s;et at the head of this part of his creation: The place of his pre&s;ent abode is accomoda|ted

<P>AND this method is peculiarly adapted to the pre&s;ent depraved &s;tate of mankind, in which by leaping the mounds of right man is the greate&s;t enemy to man.

The &s;ecurity of our liberty and property by the fundamental laws of our civil con&s;titution is the &s;tronge&s;t motive to maintain an inviolable attachment to it; and to exert our&s;elves to promote the intere&s;t of the nation to which we be|long. Every well-directed effort to &s;upport the con&s;titution on which the hap|pine&s;s

of the <HI>whole</HI> depends, and to aug|ment the wealth and &s;trength of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> empire, as our duty and intere&s;t, &s;hould be readily made by us. To mul|tiply &s;ettlements on the uncultivated lands, and reduce the <HI>wilderne&s;s</HI> to <HI>a fruit|ful field,</HI> by emigration from our older towns, and e&s;pecially by the introduc|tion of foreigners not unfriendly to our con&s;titution &mdash; to make greater im|provements in agriculture and in every u&s;eful art evidently tends to the general welfare.</P>
<P>ARBITRARY and oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures in the &s;tate would indeed di&s;pirit the peo|ple and weaken the nerves of indu&s;try, and in their con&s;equences lead to pover|ty and ruin; but a mild and equitable admini&s;tration, will encourage their hearts and &s;trengthen their hands to exe|cute with vigor tho&s;e mea&s;ures which promote the &s;trength and &s;afety of the whole.</P>
<P>To lay a foundation of greater &s;ecuri|ty to <HI>our&s;elves</HI> is indeed a laudable mo|tive

to &s;uch efforts; and may be ju&s;tified by the principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation: But the advantages of &s;uch improvements will not be confined to our&s;elves&mdash;the more populous and opulent we grow, the more able we &s;hall be to defend this important part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> dominions&mdash;the more our nation will be a terror to her enemies&mdash;and the better able &s;hall we be to make remittance for what we &s;hall nece&s;&s;arily want of her manufactures.</P>
<P>BY a proper attention to the general intere&s;t, and vigorous pur&s;uits of mea|&s;ures that tend to promote it, things may be put into &s;uch a &s;ituation as to be of mutual advantage. The growth and pro&s;perity of her colonies mu&s;t be of real advantage to <HI>Great-Britain.</HI>&mdash; The means for exportation being increased in them, will be &s;o to the colonies, by winch they may &s;ink their pre&s;ent heavy debts, and more ea&s;ily defray nece&s;&s;ary public charges.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame attention, with a little pru|dence, would lead us to retrench extra|vagant

Under greater advantages we may receive monitory and directive hints, by turning our eye to the provident ant, <HI>which having no guide, over&s;eer or ruler provides her meat in the &s;ammer and gathereth her food in the harve&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>WE are now reaping the happy fruits of our Fathers <HI>hard</HI> labor and <HI>ine&s;&s;able</HI> &s;ufferings; and &s;hall not a concern for future generations warm our hearts&mdash;produce &s;ome acts of &s;elf denial, and clo&s;er application for their &s;akes? or &s;hall we do nothing for our <HI>po&s;terity</HI> when the fir&s;t renowned &s;ettlers, here, did &s;o much for <HI>theirs?</HI> Could <HI>they</HI> look down&mdash;or rather be permitted in fle&s;h to vi&s;it their dear-bought country, with what a&s;toni&s;hment would they behold the un|grateful neglect &mdash; with what &s;everity reprove the pro&s;titution of patrimo|nial

<P>IN fine. To &s;ecure his own, and to promote the happine&s;s of others, is the part of every one in this great a&s;&s;embly. <HI>To this end</HI> were we <HI>born, and for this cau&s;e came we into the world.</HI> We were placed in that rank of being, and under tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which the infinitely wi&s;e and good Creator &s;aw proper. And as we are moral agents, and accountable; it is of great importance to us in every &s;tation, to keep in view the <HI>end</HI> of our being called into exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>THIS is but the bud of being&mdash;we are candidates for a &s;ucceeding &s;tate ; in|to which, we are a&s;&s;ured by the <HI>go&s;pel</HI> of the Son of God, the con&s;equences of our actions in <HI>this,</HI> will follow us, Nor in

the con&s;titution of thing have we long to continue here, but mortality will &s;oon tran&s;late us to the &s;tate of retribution. With what care then &s;hould we avoid e|very action deba&s;ing to the mind, and with what a&s;&s;iduity pur&s;ue tho&s;e that tend to rai&s;e it to nobler heights.</P>
<P>BY inattention and vice we may for|feit the ble&s;&s;ings of <HI>creation</HI> and <HI>redemption,</HI> and by a continued cour&s;e of fordid and unworthy actions, di&s;honorary to God and unfriendly to mankind, we may fi|ni&s;h the ruins of our nature; and put our&s;elves into a &s;uch &s;tate, that it would have been <HI>good</HI> for us if <HI>we had never been born.</HI> But by a diligent improvement of the talents committed to our tru&s;t in ex|erci&s;es of piety towards God, and charity to men, we may enoble the mind, and qualify it for the &s;ublime happine&s;s for which it was originally de&s;igned. Having therefore acted our part with fidelity in the &s;ervice of God and our generation, we &s;hall quit this imperfect &s;tate with dignity and honor, and rie &s;uperior to the highe&s;t grandeur and felicity in the&s;e
