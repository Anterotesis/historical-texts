<HEAD>A Friendly Check, from a Kind Relation, To the Chief Cannoneer, Founded on a Late In|formation, Dated N. E. <HI>Ca&s;tle-William,</HI> 1720, 21.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>KINSMAN, and FELLOW-SOLDIER!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Mea&s;ures which I hear you Take are no ways proper for your high Station. What, Sir! Only to flu&s;h, or Fire your Touch|hole with the Du&s;t, or &s;weepings of the Pow|der-Room, in receiving that Capital Enemy, <HI>Amicus Patriae,</HI> who Boldly with all his Canvas abroad, with his Jack, En&s;ign, and Pendant proudly Flying, has, [within the Reach of your Guns] Entered our Chief Harbour; with a plain De&s;ign of Mi&s;chief to many Principal Gentlemen, hoarders of
<PB N="2" REF="002310_0003_0fdb1edd014cc380">
our Bills in our Good Country; And plain|ly intends to break the Mea&s;ures of &s;uch Eminent Benefactors to the Publick? And comes with a farther Aim of doing hurt, <HI>Scil.</HI> To Teach our Unfortunate and Op|pre&s;&s;ed Neighbours, how they &s;hall grow Rich too: That in a little Time the Gen|tilities which is &s;upported by the Wi&s;e Mo|nopolys afore&s;aid, will daily Impair and grow out of Date, if he prevails, and other mean Fellows will grow &s;o Rich, that they will turn Gentlemen too; which mu&s;t needs alloy, and much &s;uppre&s;s the Coat-Armour, and Ance&s;try of our Country. And is not all this next to a Fellony!</P>
<P>Therefore Fellow Souldier! For you that &s;tand in &s;o high a Po&s;t, and only to Fire off a few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Old-&s;pent-Powder, at &s;uch a Brazer and Daring Attempt as he has made in pa&s;&s;ing our Ca&s;tle, and entering our Country; you de&s;erve by the <HI>Law of Arms,</HI> if not to be Pi&s;toled and Tumbled cro&s;s the Britch of your Cannon, yet to ride the Wooden-Hor&s;e, for your Cowardize. There|fore at your Utmo&s;t Peril; when he &s;hall weigh Anchor, and come to Sail for the High Seas, bring him too; And if he is &s;o hardy and cholerick, as to &s;tand a Bru&s;h; Then Charge with French Powder and Ball,
<PB N="3" REF="002310_0004_0fdb1ee091075c18">
as your U&s;age has been; And give him Broad &s;ide, for Broad &s;ide, and don't &s;tand flu&s;hing at him at this Cowardly Rate; for if you do he is &s;o haughty a Nature, as only to Laugh at you for your Pains.</P>
<P>Don't you &s;ee how Proudly he Rides in our Chief Harbour, with all his Colours a|broad, and in the heart of the Country; and has Ca&s;t our Gentlemen hoarders into mi&s;erable Paroxi&s;ms in the Lower Bowels, that they are in hazard of falling into Old King <HI>James's</HI> Pickle; which will be a great Misfortune to their Ladies, &amp;c. And al&s;o he has &s;o awakened, and univer&s;ally Alarmed our Country that they are fully Re&s;olved not to be Hectored or wheedled into un&s;ol|vable Penury and Va&s;&s;alage, for want of a Plentiful Medium, whence it is in their own Power to Remove tho&s;e who &s;tand in their way, and &s;upply them&s;elves. There|fore Cuz! at your Peril, Mind what I &s;ay; or if not, [as well as I love you] I will a&s;|&s;uredly Article [&s;omewhat again&s;t you to the Commander in Chief, as a Traytor, for that your Mea&s;ures are apparently full of Cowardice; and know by Camp Law, a Traytor and a Coward, &s;ignifies one and the &s;ame thing in War.

Therefore to make &s;hort my Caution, Kin&s;|man, and Fellow Souldier! Don't act the Fool or the Knave any more in &s;o great a Con|cern; but be more Manly.</P>

<P>THe Moral of the Premi&s;es is to make Known a De&s;ire that if any Gentlemen think it agreeable with the Intere&s;t of this Province, to Write in Oppo&s;ition to <HI>Amicus Patriae,</HI> that they will do it Solidly and not Pevi&s;hly; and he engages his Thanks to any Man that will fairly &s;ubvert him. And for the pre&s;ent, it was thought Rea&s;onable to An&s;wer the late Adverti&s;ement from <HI>Ca&s;tle-William</HI> in the foregoing manner. It being very proper to <HI>An&s;wer a fool according to his Folly, lea&s;t he be Wi&s;e in his own conceit,</HI> Prov. 26.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter from Amicus Patriae, to his Son.</HEAD>

<P>THE Report from Ca&s;tle-William, is &s;o mean a thing, &s;o Little in Argument, and Pe|vi&s;h in Temper, its Beneath a Wi&s;e Man to Re|&s;ent it; at lea&s;t no otherways than you &s;ee in the Inclo&s;ed. But however to &s;atisfy your &s;elf as to my Dome&s;tick Affairs, which you tho' &s;o near|ly Related are a &s;tranger to.</P>
<P>Therefore &s;ome time within le&s;s then Three Years, we took out <HI>1000</HI>l. and put into the Pub|lick Bank, an E&s;tate of <HI>2000</HI>l. which we would not take Five and Twenty Hundred for now. (Indeed &s;uch fat things Draw the&s;e Hungry Crows by a &s;trange In&s;tinct) We thought it might be very pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">per both for the Publick good and our own pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fit &s;o to do. And thro' Mercy we have Reaped great Ea&s;e and Benefit by it. For that we have &s;olved our former Money Obligations, and furni&s;hed the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Family (under your Brother's Sole management) to very great purpo&s;e, for &s;ince that our Bu&s;ine&s;s has gone on with &s;uch Succe&s;s, that we have pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed into the Bank about <HI>200</HI> l. with the Interest, and have another <HI>100</HI> l. ready to an&s;wer in that Affair.
<PB N="6" REF="002310_0007_0fdb1ee71c00c320">
And not only &s;o, but the Temporal Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Family is &s;o well Qualified and Adju&s;ted, that thro' Divine goodne&s;s, and by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Au&s;picious and Pro&s;perous Bills, we do not fall &s;hort of Three Hundred Pounds Annual Income. And not only &s;o, but tho' the Pevi&s;h Gentleman (If he be a Man) does allow if we put in <HI>2000</HI>l. which is already grown in Value, but al&s;o their Remains in our hands no ways intangled by the Bank, in Rich hou&s;en, home|&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad, Remote Lands, and other E&s;tates to the Value of One Thou&s;and Pounds, or not much un|der. That con&s;idering what we have Done in le&s;s than Three Years towards the &s;olving the Bank, &amp;c. I am full of A&s;&s;urance that in the Re|maining Six Years, by Divine Aid, and by a Frugal and Prudent Management we are quite out of Danger, as to Crows and Vultures,</P>
<P>Therefore what I have Wrote on the Bank of Credit, was purely in Love to my Country, that all Men in their Affairs, may be as Pro&s;|perous as I have been. At Lea&s;t that our Coun|try may Univer&s;ally Flouri&s;h in their Outward Affairs.</P>

<P>N. B. THat Amicus Patriae a late Author is Worldly Wi&s;e Man, and has &s;poke two Words for him&s;elf, and not one for his Country, as Actions will better &s;hew a Mans de&s;igns then his Words; it would have been but the ingenious part in him, to have told us that from Twenty Years long experience he has not been able to pay Intere&s;t for Money bor|rowed of Private People, and of Twelve Hun|dred and Fifty Pounds (of his Miracle work|ing Paper Money) borrowed of the Government by him&s;elf and two Sons he has yet paid but <HI>250</HI> l. of it in again; 'tis therefore that he de|clares, and will in&s;i&s;t on it, as the be&s;t way to enrich his Country, to make Paper Bills enough for every body to take what they plea&s;e, and further (in his whole bu&s;tle of words) &s;ayeth not.</P>
