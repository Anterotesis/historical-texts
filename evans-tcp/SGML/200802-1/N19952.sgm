<HEAD>AN ENQUIRY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING publickly a&s;&s;erted, that I believed our late Epi|demic Fever to have been generated in our city, I here|with enclo&s;e you my rea&s;ons for that opinion, accompanied by a wi&s;h that they may be laid before the public; for I conceive they are extremely intere&s;ting, both to our city, and to the United States.</P>
<P><HI>The&s;e rea&s;ons are, as follows:&mdash;</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Yellow Fever in the We&s;t Indies, and in all other countries where it is endemic, is the offspring of vegetable putre|faction.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;ame cau&s;es (under like circum&s;tances) mu&s;t always produce the &s;ame effects. There is nothing in the air of the We&s;t Indies above other hot countries, which di&s;po&s;es it to produce a yellow fever. Similar degrees of heat acting upon dead and moi&s;t vegetable matters, are capable of producing it, to|gether with all its various modifications, in every part of the world. In &s;upport of this opinion, I &s;hall tran&s;cribe a part of a letter I received a few weeks ago from Dr. Miller, of the Dela|ware &s;tate&mdash;a gentleman who&s;e authority in medicine is &s;econd to no man's in the United States.</P>

<SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Since the middle of la&s;t July, we have had a Bilious Colic epidemic in this neighborhood which exhibits phoenomena very &s;ingular in this climate; and &s;o far as I am informed, unprece|dented in the medical records, or popular tradition of this coun|try. To avoid unnece&s;&s;ary details, it will &s;uffice at pre&s;ent to ob&s;erve, that the di&s;ea&s;e, on this occa&s;ion, has a&s;&s;umed not only all the e&s;&s;ential characters, but likewi&s;e all the violence, ob&s;tinacy and malignity de&s;cribed by the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indian practitioners. If any difference can be ob&s;erved, it &s;eems here to manife&s;t higher degrees of &s;tubbornne&s;s and malignity, than we u&s;ually meet in the hi&s;tories of tropical writers. In the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, not only extreme con&s;tipation, frequent vomiting, and the mo&s;t excruciating pains of the bowels and limbs, harra&s;s the unhappy patient; but to the&s;e &s;ucceed paraly&s;is, convul&s;ions, &amp;c. and almo&s;t always uncommon mu&s;cular debility,&mdash;oppre&s;&s;ion of the praecordia, &amp;c. are the con&s;equence of a &s;evere attack. Bile di&s;|charged in enormous quantities, con&s;tantly a&s;&s;umes the mo&s;t corrupted and acrimonious appearances, commonly aeruginous in a very high degree, and &s;ometimes quite atrabilious.</P>
<P>The inference I mean to draw from the phoenomena of this di&s;ea&s;e, as it appears in this neighborhood, and which I pre|&s;ume will al&s;o apply to your epidemic, is THIS, that from the uncommon protraction, and inten&s;ene&s;s of our &s;ummer and au|tumnal heats, but principally from the unu&s;ual drought; we have had &s;ince the middle of July, a near approach to a TROPICAL &s;ea&s;on, and that of con&s;equence we ought not to be &s;urpri&s;ed if tropical di&s;ea&s;es, even of the mo&s;t malignant nature, are ANGEN|DERED among&s;t us.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="5" REF="026111_0005_0FCFB18F954392B0">To the above information, it may be added, that the bilious fever and dy&s;entery, which prevailed during the late autumn in &s;everal of the villages of Penn&s;ylvania, particularly in Harri&s;burgh and Hummil&s;town, were attended with a malignity and morta|lity unknown before in any part of the &s;tate. I need not pau&s;e to remark, that this dy&s;entery aro&s;e from putrid exhalations, and that it is like the bilious cholic, only a modification of one ori|ginal Genus of bilious fever.</P>
<P>But further&mdash;a malignant fever, re&s;embling that which has prevailed in our city, has appeared on Pen&s;ocken and on Walkill creeks, in New-Jer&s;ey; at NewGalloway, in the &s;tate of New-York&mdash;and at Weathersfield in Connecticut, during the late autumnal months, into none of which places was there a &s;u&s;pi|cion of the di&s;ea&s;e having been imported from abroad, or convey|ed by an intercour&s;e with the city of Philadelphia.</P>
<P>It is no objection to the inference which follows from the&s;e facts, that the common remitting fever was not known during the above period in the neighborhood of this city, and in many other parts of the &s;tate, where it had u&s;ually appeared in the au|tumnal months. There is a certain combination of moi&s;ture with heat, which is e&s;&s;ential to the production of the remote cau&s;e of a bilious fever. Where the heat is &s;o inten&s;e, or of &s;uch long du|ration, as wholly to di&s;&s;ipate moi&s;ture, or when the rains are &s;o great as totally to overflow the mar&s;hy ground, or to wa&s;h away putrid ma&s;&s;es of matter, no fever can be produced.</P>
<P>Dr. Dazilles, in his treati&s;e upon the di&s;ea&s;es of the negroes in the We&s;t Indies, informs us, that the RAINY &s;ea&s;on is the mo&s;t healthy at Cayenne, owing to the neighboring mora&s;&s;es
<PB N="6" REF="026111_0006_0FCF8DD7289E48F0">
being DEEPLY overflowed&mdash;whereas at St. Domingo, a DRY &s;ea|&s;on is mo&s;t productive of di&s;ea&s;es; owing to its favouring tho&s;e degrees of moi&s;ture which produce morbid exhalations. The&s;e facts will explain the rea&s;on why, in certain &s;ea&s;ons, places which are naturally healthy in our country, become &s;ickly, while tho&s;e places which are naturally &s;ickly e&s;cape the prevailing epidemic&punc; Previou&s;ly to the di&s;&s;ipation of the moi&s;ture from the putrid ma&s;&s;es of vegetable matters in our &s;treets, and in the neighbourhood of the city, there were (as &s;everal practitioners can te&s;tify) many ca&s;es of mild remittents, but they all di&s;appeared about the fir&s;t week in September.</P>
<P N="3">3. A quantity of damaged coffee, was expo&s;ed at a time (July the 24th) and in a &s;ituation (on a wharf, and in a dock) which favoured its putrefaction, and exhalation. Its &s;mell was highly putrid and offen&s;ive, in&s;omuch that the inhabitants of the hou&s;es in Water and Front Streets, who were near it, were obliged in the hotte&s;t weather to exclude it, by &s;hutting their doors and windows. Even per&s;ons, who only walked along tho&s;e &s;treets, complained of an intolerable foetor, which upon enquiring was con&s;tantly traced to the putrid coffee. It &s;hould not &s;urprize us, that this &s;eed, &s;o inoffen&s;ive in its natural &s;tate, &s;hould pro|duce, after its putrefaction, a violent fever. The records of medicine furni&s;h in&s;tances of &s;imilar fevers being produced, by the putrefaction of many other regetable &s;ub&s;tances. Fourteen men out of &s;ixteen, peri&s;hed by a malignant fever, a few years ago, at the i&s;land of Tortola, from the effluvia generated by &s;ome putrefied Potatoes, which were taken out of the hold of a Liverpool ve&s;&s;el. "The effluvia (&s;ays Dr. Zimmerman) from a little heap of flax, has been known to occa&s;ion a malignant fever, which proved fatal to the family, in which it fir&s;t began, and
<PB N="7" REF="026111_0007_0FCFB18D30C83478">
afterwards &s;pread its <HI>contagion</HI> through a whole country." Dr. Rodgers in his treati&s;e upon the di&s;ea&s;es of Cork, mentions a malignant fever which &s;wept away a great number of the Students of Wadham College in Oxford. "The &s;ingularity of the ca&s;e (adds the Doctor) engaged all the gentlemen of the faculty, in a &s;erious inquiry into the cau&s;es of &s;o remarkable an effect, and all agreed that the <HI>contagious</HI> infection aro&s;e from the putre|faction of a va&s;t quantity of Cabbages thrown into a heap out of the &s;everal gardens near the College." Lanci&s;&s;i relates, that one end of the city of Rome was nearly de&s;olated by the effluvia of &s;ome rotted hemp, which lay in the neighbourhood of the city. The &s;ame author remarks, that "fevers often prevail at Con&s;tantinople, which owe their origin to the hemp which is brought from Cairo, and which is put wet into the public grana|ries, and &s;uffered to ferment during the &s;ummer. It is after|wards &s;old, and the &s;eeds of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are afterwards &s;pread among the people."&mdash;Many other facts might be addu|ced of radi&s;hes, turnips, garlic, and &s;undry other vegetables, generating by putrefaction, fevers, &s;imilar to tho&s;e which have been mentioned.</P>
<P N="4">4. The rapid progre&s;s of the fever from Water &s;treet, and the cour&s;es through which it travelled into other parts of the city, afford a &s;trong evidence that it was at fir&s;t propagated chiefly by exhalation from the putrid coffee. It is remarkable that it pa&s;&s;ed fir&s;t through tho&s;e alleys and &s;treets, which were in the cour&s;e of the winds that blew acro&s;s the dock and wharf where the coffee lay, and that per&s;ons were affected at a much greater di&s;tance from Water &s;treet by that means, than was afterwards known by means of the contagion which was generated by in|fected per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="8" REF="026111_0008_0FCFB184C64D9DF0">5. Many per&s;ons who had worked, or even vi&s;ited in the neighbourhood of the exhalation from the coffee, early in the month of Augu&s;t, were indi&s;po&s;ed afterwards with &s;ickne&s;s, puking, and yellow &s;weats, long before the air of Water &s;treet was &s;o much impregnated with the contagion, at to pro|duce &s;uch effects; and &s;everal patients whom I attended in the yellow fever declared to me, or to their friends, that their in|di&s;po&s;itions began exactly at the time they inhaled the offen&s;ive effluvia of the coffee.</P>
<P N="6">6. The &s;tricte&s;t inquiry, accompanied with the greate&s;t &s;o|licitude for proofs, has not been able to di&s;cover any other cau&s;e of our late Epidemic. Every account of the importation of the di&s;ea&s;e, has been di&s;covered upon examination to be inac|curate, contradictory and without foundation. The fir&s;t ca&s;es of the yellow fever have been clearly traced to the &s;ailors of the ve&s;&s;el who were fir&s;t expo&s;ed to the effluvia of the Coffee. Their &s;ick|ne&s;s commenced with the day on which the coffee began to emit its putrid &s;mell. The di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread with the encrea&s;e of the poi&s;onous exhalation. A journeyman of Mr. Peter Brown's, who worked near the corner of Race and Water &s;treets, caught the di&s;ea&s;e on the 27th of July. Elizabeth Hill the wife of a fi&s;her|man was infected by only &s;ailing near the pe&s;tilential wharf, about the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, and died at Ken&s;ington on the 14th of the &s;ame month. Many other names might be mentioned of per|&s;ons who &s;ickened during the la&s;t week in July or the fir&s;t week in Augu&s;t, who a&s;cribed their illne&s;&s;es to the &s;mell of the coffee. From two of tho&s;e per&s;ons who came under my notice, the di&s;|ea&s;e was evidently propagated by contagion: from one of them, to nearly a whole family&mdash;and from the other to a girl of eight years old, who was led by curio&s;ity to examine the
<PB N="9" REF="026111_0009_0FCFB18370EFADF0">
low colour which it was &s;aid had appeared in the face of the infected per&s;on, after death.</P>
<P N="7">7. It has been remarked that this fever did not &s;pread in the country, when carried there by per&s;ons who were infected, and who afterwards died with it. This I conceive was occa&s;ioned, in part by the contagion being deprived of the aid of mia&s;mata from the putrid matter which fir&s;t produced it in our city, and in part, by its being diluted, and thereby weakened by the pure air of the country. During four times in which it prevailed in Charle&s;ton, in no one in&s;tance, according to Dr. Lining, was it propagated in any other part of the &s;tate.</P>
<P N="8">8. It is very remarkable that in the hi&s;tories of the di&s;order which have been pre&s;erved in this country, it has <HI>&s;even</HI> times appeared about the fir&s;t or middle of Augu&s;t, and declined, or cea&s;ed about the middle of October&mdash;viz. in 1732, 1739, 1745 and 1748 in Charle&s;ton&mdash;in 1791 in New-York, and in 1762 and 1793 in Philadelphia. This frequent occurrence of the yellow fever at the u&s;ual period of our common bilious remit|tents, cannot be a&s;cribed to accidental coincidence, but mu&s;t be re&s;olved in mo&s;t ca&s;es into the combination of more active mia&s;mata with the predi&s;po&s;ition of a tropical &s;ea&s;on. In &s;pea|king of a tropical &s;ea&s;on, I include that kind of weather in which rains and heats are alternated with each other, as well as that, which is uniformly warm.</P>
<P N="9">9. Several circum&s;tances attended the late epidemic, which do not occur in the We&s;t-India yellow fever. It affected chil|dren as well as adults in common with our annual bilious fevers. In the We&s;t-Indies Dr. Hume tells us it never attacked any per|&s;on under puberty. It had moreover many peculiar &s;ymptoms
<PB N="10" REF="026111_0010_0FCFB181C6460C70">
(as I hope to &s;hew in a future publication) which are not to be met with in any of the hi&s;tories of the We&s;t-India yellow fever.</P>
<P N="10">10. Why &s;hould it &s;urpri&s;e us to &s;ee a yellow fever generated among&s;t us? It is only a higher grade of a fever which prevails every year in our city, from vegetable putrefaction. It conforms, in the difference of its degrees of violence and danger, to &s;ea&s;on, as well as climate, and in this re&s;pect it is upon a footing with the &s;mall-pox, the mea&s;les, the &s;ore throat, and &s;everal other di&s;ea&s;es. There are few years pa&s;s, in which a plethoric habit, and more active but limited mia&s;mata, do not produce Sporadic Ca&s;es, of true yellow fever in Philadelphia. It is very common in South and North Carolina and in Virginia, and there are facts which prove, that not only &s;trangers, but native individuals, and in one in&s;tance, a whole family have been carried off by it in the &s;tate of Maryland. It proved fatal to One hundred per&s;ons in the city of New-York, in the year of 1791, where it was evi|dently generated by putrid exhalation. The yellow color of the &s;kin, has unfortunately too often been con&s;idered as the characteri&s;tic mark of this fever, otherwi&s;e many other in&s;tan|ces of its prevalence might be di&s;covered, I have no doubt in every part of the United States. I wi&s;h with Dr. Mo&s;ely, the term <HI>yellow,</HI> could be aboli&s;hed from the titles of this fever, for this color is not only frequently ab&s;ent, but &s;ometimes occurs in the milde&s;t bilious remittents. Dr. Haller in his pathology de|&s;cribes an epidemic of this kind in Swi&s;&s;erland, in which this colour generally attended, and I have once &s;een it almo&s;t univer&s;al in a common bilious fever which prevailed in the Americam army in the year 1776.</P>
<P>If any thing could &s;urprize me after reading the public report
<PB N="11" REF="026111_0011_0FCFB17F9F074490">
of our late fever having been imported, in &s;pite of every po&s;&s;ible evidence to the contrary, it would be, the opinion which has been publickly delivered by &s;everal medical gentlemen <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> no fe|ver produced by vegetable putrefaction and ex<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">tion had ever been contagious. The fevers generated by putrid cabbage mentioned by Dr. Rodgers, and by putrid flax mentioned by Dr. Zimmerman, were both contagious. The late Dr. Wil&s;on of Lew|estown, in Delaware &s;tate, in his hi&s;tory of a malignant fever, in Su&s;&s;ex county, publi&s;hed in the United States Magazine for April, 1775, after tracing its cau&s;e to exhalations from &s;avannahs or ponds, after a dry &s;ea&s;on, expre&s;sly mentions that it was contagi|ous. "Some (he &s;ays) were taken ill a few days after they had &s;een the &s;ick, but e&s;pecially after they had been at the inter|ring the dead. Some went a week, and &s;ome perhaps a fort|night, and a few took it from the air, without going nigh the &s;ick." I have &s;een a bilious fever, received by contagion, in a ca&s;e which came under my notice in September, 1778; and there are many facts which make it probable, that the bilious, or, as it was commonly called, the break-bone-fever of 1780, was propagated, in many in&s;tances, through our city, by means of contagion. The malignant fever, which was lately generated at Wethersfield, in Connecticut, it is &s;aid was evidently con|tagious.&mdash;Even the intermitting fever, according to Doctor Clarke, has, in &s;ome in&s;tances, generated a morbid matter which has produced the di&s;ea&s;e in per&s;ons who had not been expo&s;ed to the u&s;ual remote cau&s;e of that di&s;order. A &s;i|milar in&s;tance of an intermittent being propagated by conta|gion in Virginia was communicated to me a year ago by a medical gentleman in that country. In all the five la&s;t mentioned ca&s;es, the original di&s;ea&s;e which produced the contagion was gene|rated by exhalations from putrid vegetable matters.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="026111_0012_0FCFB17E1EBAF180">I am far from denying that this di&s;ea&s;e, has not &s;ometimes been imported into our country. From the authority of Dr. Lind, and Dr. Mitchell, it appears that this has been the ca&s;e in &s;eve|ral in&s;tances. In this re&s;pect, it is upon a footing with the plague, which is both an imported and a generated di&s;ea&s;e, in the cities of the Ea&s;t. I am di&s;po&s;ed however to believe that the in&s;tances of the yellow fever, being imported, are very few compared with tho&s;e of its being generated in our country. What makes this opinion probable, is, that neither Great Britain, nor Ireland, have ever to my knowledge been infected by this fever, notwith&s;tanding their long and frequent com|mercial intercour&s;e with the We&s;t-India i&s;lands. The &s;ummers in each of tho&s;e countries, though &s;edom <HI>hot</HI> enough to gene|rate a contagious yellow, or bilious fever, are notwith&s;tanding <HI>warm</HI> enough, to favour the propagation of an imported con|tagion of that di&s;order. The jail fever which has more than once been introduced into our city in crowded &s;hips from Hol|land, I &s;u&s;pect has been &s;ometimes mi&s;taken for the yellow fever of the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>I am aware that the opinion and facts which I have &s;tated, are not popular with our citizens; but I have not concealed them during the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, nor &s;hall I cea&s;e to im|pre&s;s them upon the public mind at every hazard, not only as the re&s;ult of my judgment, but as the dictates of my con&s;cience, for I am per&s;uaded they involve in their con&s;equences the lives of millions that are yet unborn.&mdash;Commerce can no more be endangered than Religion, by the publication of Philo&s;ophical truth. On the contrary it mu&s;t &s;uffer mo&s;t by the adoption of the traditional error which I have endeavoured to refute; for
<PB N="13" REF="026111_0013_0FCFB17CB880CC48">
while the cau&s;e of a malignant fever is obvious to the &s;en&s;es, it will be ea&s;y to guard again&s;t it; but while it is believed that the di&s;ea&s;e may be imported, and no body know from what <HI>place,</HI> at what <HI>time,</HI> and in <HI>what manner;</HI> we &s;hall not only be carele&s;s in the mid&s;t of filth and danger, but our city will always hold its character for health by a timid and precarious tenure. I am the more di&s;po&s;ed to expect forgivene&s;s from my fellow citizens for this attempt to &s;erve them, by the recollection of the &s;udden change in the health of our city which followed the arching the offen&s;ive dock between Front and Third &s;treets in the year 1782. By advi&s;ing that mea&s;ure (in which I &s;tood nearly alone) I incurred the cen&s;ure of &s;everal valuable citizens. The bills of mortality however &s;oon &s;hewed that the mea&s;ure was right, and I have &s;ince &s;een with great plea&s;ure, the extraordi|nary healthine&s;s of our city, a&s;cribed by indifferent people, to that, among other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The climate of our country can no more &s;uffer than the commerce of our city, by this inve&s;tigation, for it fixes the late fever, and all the other malignant fevers of the United States, upon putrid vegetable exhalation. Without the matrix of putrid vegetable matters, there can no more be a bilious, or yellow fever generated among&s;t us, than there can be vegetation without earth, water, or air. To a&s;cribe our late di&s;ea&s;e therefore to the exclu&s;ive influence of the atmo&s;phere, is a reflection upon our climate, which is equally unphilo&s;ophical and unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Let it only be clearly proved, and boldly a&s;&s;erted, that a bilious yellow fever has been, and may be generated in our country, under the circum&s;tances before mentioned, and the re|turn
<PB N="14" REF="026111_0014_0FCFB17B12F9E130">
of it, at al&s;o of common bilious; and intermitting fevers may every where be prevented by a due attention to the clean|line&s;s of the wharves, and Suburbs, as well as the &s;treets of our cities, and towns; by draining and cultivating mar&s;hy grounds in their neighbourhood, and in the neighbourhood of farm hou&s;es,&mdash;and where the la&s;t cannot be done, by &s;helter|ing them from the current of vegetable exhalations by means of a body of trees that are of &s;peedy growth. In this manner, ma|lignant and deadly fevers have been bani&s;hed from mo&s;t of the cities in Europe.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that the opinion I have delivered upon the origin of our late fever has been accommodated to my mode of treating it: this is not true: my treatment of it would have been the &s;ame had I believed it to have been an imported di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this long letter with two ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The principle of &s;elf love which is &s;o exten&s;ive in its influ|ence upon human actions, has unhappily corrupted the &s;cience of medicine; hence we find dangerous and loath&s;ome di&s;ea&s;es are con&s;idered by all nations, as of foreign extraction. Even the yellow fever it&s;elf in &s;ome parts of the We&s;t Indies, is denied to be a native of the I&s;lands. It is &s;aid by many of their writers to have been imported from Siam in the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Medical, like religious &s;uper&s;tition cleaves &s;o clo&s;ely to the human mind, that it often exi&s;ts under new forms, and names, in &s;pite of the cultivation and progre&s;s of rea&s;on: hence we find that malignant fevers, which in former ages were a&s;cribed to cele&s;tial, planetary and demoniacal influence, are now with
