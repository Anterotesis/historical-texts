<Q><BIBL>Deuteronomy XVII.18, 19.</BIBL>
<P>And it &s;hall be when he &s;itteth upon the Throne of his Kingdom, he &s;hall write him a Copy of this Law in a Book, out of that which is before the Priests, the Levites.</P>
<P>And it &s;hall be with him, and be &s;hall Read therein all the Days of his Life: that he may Learn to Fear the Lord his God, to keep all the Words of this Law, and all the&s;e Statutes, to do them.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN God chose I&s;rael to be His peculiar People before all the Nations of the Earth, He gave them Laws, Statutes, &amp; Ordinances of &s;everal &s;orts : He gave them not only the Moral Law written on the <HI>Tables of Stone,</HI> at Mount <HI>Sinai</HI>; which was a Rule to direct them in the performance of tho&s;e Duties which the Light of Nature had more imperfectly inculcated upon them : but He gave them al&s;o the Ceremonial Law, con&s;i&s;t|ing in &s;undry Rites and Ceremonies, to be u&s;ed in their Religious Wor&s;hip; mo&s;t of
<PB N="2" REF="001769_0003_0FB825872A3C1E58">
which had a Typical reference unto the Me&s;|&s;iah to come, &amp; the Righteou&s;ne&s;s that He was to bring in, and &s;o cea&s;ed with the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah. And moreover, be&s;ides the&s;e, God gave them al&s;o their Judicial or Common|Wealth Law, which con&s;i&s;ted in &s;undry Sta|tutes, and Political Orders; directing how the Civil Affairs of their Common Wealth, as they were a Civil State, &s;hould be managed. Our Text and Context is a Branch of their Civil Law, and is God's Statute to I&s;rael, de|claring how their King, their Chief Civil Ruler, &s;hould bear &amp; behave him&s;elf in that high &amp; dignify'd Station, and how he &s;hould Qualify him&s;elf for that Po&s;t in the Govern|ment of God's People, &s;o as to attain the right Ends of Civil Government, and be God's Mini&s;ter, for good to His People.</P>
<P>In the words of the Text we may ob&s;erve two things more generally;</P>
<P N="1">(1.) God declares what the Chief Civil Ruler of His People &s;hall do, or what he ought to do.</P>
<P N="2">(2) He renders a Rea&s;on why he &s;hall thus do.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to what God requires the King the Chief Civil Magi&s;trate to do; its in the&s;e words, <HI>When he &s;itteth on the Throne of his King|dom, he &s;hall write him a Copy of this Law in a Book, out of that which is before the Prie&s;ts, the
<PB N="3" REF="001769_0004_0FB82588EA691DE0">
Levites; And it &s;hall be with him, and he &s;hall Read therein all the Days of his Life.</HI> And here by a parity of Rea&s;on, this Command &s;eems to be binding to all Inferiour Magi&s;trates, tho' none but the Chief is expre&s;&s;ed; for their Office is of the &s;ame kind, tho' their Power may be le&s;s in degree: And then the rea&s;on rendred to Enforce the Command, &s;hews it to be as needful for all Inferiour Civil Rulers, to comply with this Com|mand, as the Chief, for they have all need to fear the Lord their God, and to keep all His Statutes, to do them; and particularly that of Executing Judgment among His People, &s;o as to be God's Mini&s;ter for good to them; the great End of the Office of Civil Rulers, whether of higher or lower Degree. And in this Command of God, re&s;pecting Civil Rulers, there are two Branches.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That the King, the Chief Ruler <HI>&s;hould Write out a Copy of this Law in a Book, out of that which is before the Priests, the Levites.</HI> Here we may do well to ob&s;erve, that this Origi|nal Law, out of which the Ruler was to take a Copy, was not only the Moral &amp; Ceremo|nial Law, but al&s;o the Civil or Judicial Law, which was to be the Rule of his Govern|ment; and according to which he was to Execute Ju&s;tice &amp; Judgment in I&s;rael. This is plain, if we con&s;ider that the Civil Law,
<PB N="4" REF="001769_0005_0FB8258A5C2AF7D0">
as well as the Ceremonial, was laid up before the Prie&s;ts, in the &s;ides of the Ark of the Covenant, there to be kept from one Gene|neration to another; as its written, Deut. 31.24, 25, 26. <HI>And it came to pa&s;s when Mo&s;es had made an end of writing all the Words of this Law in a Book, until they were fini&s;hed; that Mo&s;es Commanded the Levites that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, &s;aying, Take this Book of the Law, and put it in the &s;ides of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a Witne&s;s again&s;t thee.</HI> And this was more than the Moral Law, for that was repo&s;ited in the Ark, and not in the &s;ides; as may be &s;een at large, in <HI>Deut.</HI> 10.2, &amp; 5.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The &s;econd Branch of the Command unto the Civil Ruler is, <HI>That he &s;hould keep this Copy he had taken by him, and &s;hould Read therein all the Days of his Life.</HI> The meaning &s;eems to be, that he &s;hould often Read and Study this Law; and thereby get the Letter of this Law well fixed in his Memory, and his Under&s;tanding well inlightned as to the meaning and true intent of the Law; (both which frequent Reading and Study hath a tendency to promote.)</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>More generally</HI>; In the Words we may take notice of the Rea&s;on rendred, to En|force this Command, and that is this; <HI>That he may learn to Fear the Lord his God, and to
<PB N="5" REF="001769_0006_0FB8258BBB7F8588">
keep all the Words of this Law, and all the&s;e Statutes, to do them.</HI> The general Nature of the Rea&s;on &s;eems to be this; That he might by his own Practi&s;e, according to the Moral and Ceremonial Law, and by exerci&s;ing his Power over the People, according to the Limitation of the Civil Law, &s;hew him&s;elf to be one that fears God, and will be God's Mini&s;ter for good to His People; (as <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.4.) One that will take care that the Laws of God, and the good and whole&s;ome Laws of the Common Wealth are kept: Which is the great End of the Office of all Civil Rulers, whether Supreme or Subordi|nate; for they are all to be God's Mini&s;ters for good, &s;uch as bear not the Sword in vain, Revengers to Execute Wrath on them that do Evil.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINE from the Words, on which I may in&s;i&s;t is this;</P>
<P>That the frequent Reading and Studying the Scriptures, and the Civil Law of the Common Wealth, is a thing very Needful and Profitable, for Civil Rulers in order to a right Execution of their Re&s;pective Civil Offices.</P>
<P>For Illu&s;tration of the Doctrine, it may be needful to State and An&s;wer one Enquiry, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001769_0007_0FB8258D3B6E2450">Que&s;t. <HI>Wherein con&s;i&s;teth the right Execution of the Civil Rulers Office</HI>?</P>
<P>Precedent to the Reply unto this Enquiry, it may be premi&s;ed, That Civil Rulers, in the Di&s;cour&s;e under management, are to be taken in a limited &s;en&s;e; only as they are ve&s;ted with Executive Power of Government and not Legi&s;lative; not as they may be con|cerned with Legi&s;lative Power in Govern|ment. This we may take notice of in the whole of the following Di&s;cour&s;e. This being premi&s;ed, I an&s;wer the Que&s;tion &s;tated, (1.) More generally. (2.) More particularly.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>More gen.</HI> The right Execution of the Civil Rulers Office lyeth, in their well Go|verning of a People &s;ubject to their Autho|rity, according to Ju&s;t and Good Laws, &s;o as to be God's Mini&s;ters for good to them. It is not meerly in Ruling a People, but in Ru|ling them by good and whole&s;ome Laws, keeping within the due limits of their Power in Government. All Civil Rulers have their Power of Government limited, and that by the Boundaries of &s;ome Laws, that are the Laws of that Kingdom, State or Common Wealth, over which any particular Ruler or Rulers are &s;et to Govern. All ju&s;t Govern|ment, whether it be Monarchie or Popular, or
<PB N="7" REF="001769_0008_0FB825901C301C38">
a Mixture of both, or of any other differing Form; is originally founded in either Com|pact or Conque&s;t (where the War is ju&s;t on the Conquerors part:) Now when &amp; where its founded originally in Compact or Agree|ment, between the parties Ruling and Ruled, there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ome Rules agreed upon which the Ruler is bound to take notice of, in his exerting Power of Government over the Ruled; for as none can make a ju&s;t Claim to any Natural Ori|ginal Right to Rule over others, (Family Rulers only excepted) &s;o Mankind never did nor will, Submit them&s;elves voluntarily to the Government of others their Fellow|Men; but upon &s;ome Agreement of what Rules, the Ruler or Rulers &s;hould ob&s;erve in Government; which Rules are the Laws of that Kingdom or State &s;o Covenanting to be under Government; and in &s;uch Go|vernment founded thus Originally in Com|pact; the right Execution of the Civil Ru|lers Office lyeth in the impartial &amp; upright Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice among &s;uch a People, according to the&s;e Rules. And a|gain; When and where the Government of any Civil State, is originally founded in Con|que&s;t, (which may be a Ju&s;t Government, where the War is Ju&s;t on the Conquerors part) yet there God hath not Left &s;uch Con|nqueror

at his liberty, what Laws to impo&s;e upon his Conquered Subjects, but hath obli|ged him to in&s;titute good Laws for the Rule of his Government, for he is bound to be God's Mini&s;ter for good to the People, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.4. A revenger to execute Wrath upon them that do evil, and not on them that do good; and &s;o his Laws mu&s;t be corre&s;pondent to the Laws of God, and &s;o good. Neither hath God left it at &s;uch Conquerors liberty, when he hath in&s;tituted good Laws, whether he will keep to them, as the Rule of exert|ing his Executive Power in Government, or no: but he is as much bound to Govern by &s;uch good Laws as to make them; <HI>for he that Ruleth over men, mu&s;t be Ju&s;t, Ruling in the fear of the Lord.</HI> This the Rock of I&s;rael hath &s;aid, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23.3.</P>
<P>But more <HI>Particularly</HI> to Re&s;olve the En|quiry before us, we An&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. The right Execution of the Civil Ma|gi&s;trates Office, partly con&s;i&s;teth in pre&s;erving promoting, &amp; maintaining <HI>Peace</HI> among the People over whom they are &s;et to Rule; and to do this by executing good and whole&s;om laws made for that end. One great end of the Civil Rulers Office is Peace; that Peace might be kept was one end for which God appointed and approveth of Civil Govern|ment. Peace is a very valuable and choice
<PB N="9" REF="001769_0010_0FB82593280A07D0">
outward Mercy; and therefore the Spirit of God, in the Hundred &amp; Thirty Third <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> compares it to the Odori&s;erous Anointing Oil, <HI>that ran down upon Aarons Head &amp; Beard, even to the skirts of his Garments.</HI> Now mens Lu&s;ts Interrupt the &s;tream of this Choice Ble&s;&s;ing; as <HI>James</HI> faith, Jam. 4.1. <HI>Whence come Wars and Fightings, but from your Lu&s;ts</HI>? And thus every Kingdom &amp; Country would be in an Uprore, and ru&s;h quickly into in|evitable Ruine, if there was not &s;ome Ma|gi&s;trate in the Land to keep the Peace. And therefore God hath appointed &s;uch an Office among men; and men them&s;elves have &s;een it needful every where, to &s;et up &s;ome Forms of Civil Government for this End. Paralel here unto are we commanded, in I Tim. 2.1, 2. <HI>To Pray for Kings, and all in Places of Au|thority; that under them we may lead quiet and Peaceable Lives.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The right Execution of the Civil Rulers Office, partly con&s;i&s;teth, in their obliging men &s;ubject to their Authority, to <HI>Wor&s;hip God</HI> according to Divine ln&s;titution, &s;o far as they are enabled to do it, by virtue of any Civil Law of the Common Wealth over which they Rule The Civil Magi&s;trate is rightly &s;tyled, <HI>Cu&s;tos utriu&s;que Tabula</HI>; The Keeper of both Tables. Its as much within his Pro|vince to &s;ee that Men under his Authority,
<PB N="10" REF="001769_0011_0FB825949E49B920">
attend Fir&s;t Table Duties to God, as to ob|lige them to Second Table Duties; as Du|ties of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> towards their Fel|low Men. Thus the good King <HI>A&s;a</HI> did; as we find, in 2 Chron. 14.3, 4. <HI>He took away the Altars of the &s;trange gods, and the high places,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their Fathers, and to do the Law and the Commandment.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The right Execution of the Civil Ma|gi&s;trates Office, con&s;i&s;teth partly in rendring &s;uch <HI>Rewards</HI> to the Righteous and Vertuous in the Land, as they may by Law; and e&s;pe|cially in &s;hielding them from tho&s;e Injuries, Oppre&s;&s;ions &amp; Violence, that they are liable to, and may be in danger of: and mo&s;t cer|tainly to acquit them, in Judgement when ever the Righteous and Vertuous, happen to be Arraigned at the Tribunal Bar under the &s;uppo&s;ition, and accu&s;ation of Guilty per&s;ons, as Violaters of the Laws. The Civil Rulers are as much bound in Duty as Officers in the Civil State, to Ju&s;tify the Righteous in Judgment, as to Condemn the Wicked. Both were incumbent on the Judges in I&s;rael, by one and the &s;ame Command; as Deut. 25.1. <HI>If there be a Controver&s;ie between men, and they come to Judgment, that the Judges may Judge them, then they &s;hall Ju&s;tify the Righteous, and Condemn the Wicked.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="11" REF="001769_0012_0FB82599781F8208">4. The right Execution of the Civil Rulers Office, in part lieth in the <HI>Condemning</HI> &amp; <HI>Pun|i&s;hing</HI> according to the Rule of the Law, tho&s;e that are guilty of breaking the good &amp; whol|&s;om <HI>Penal Laws</HI> of the Land; e&s;pecially if the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion be a Violation of any <HI>Moral Precept,</HI> &s;o that the Criminal hath tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the Law of GOD, as well as the good and whole&s;om Laws of the Government; then the Civil Ruler with <HI>Phineas</HI>'s Zeal and re|ligious Fortitude, &s;hould take up the righteous Javelin of the Law, and finite through the Loines of &s;uch workers of Iniquity; that all <HI>I&s;rael</HI> may hear and fear, and do no more &s;o Wickedly: In thus doing, the Civil Ruler becomes God's Mini&s;ter for good; as <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.4 A revenger to execute Wrath upon them that do evil. The Civil Ruler doth rightly execute his Office in &s;uch Ca&s;es, when he acteth without fear of offending any but God; and without indulgent affection on the &s;core of Con&s;aguinity or Affinity; after the Example of that Tribe of <HI>Levi,</HI> in the Wil|derne&s;s at Mount-<HI>Sinai,</HI> when I&s;rael was fallen to Idolatry; of whom it is recorded, in <HI>Deut.</HI> 33.9. That with reference to Executing Judgment for God; <HI>he &s;aid of his Father, and his Mother, I have not &s;een him; neither did he acknowledge his Brethren, nor knew his own Children.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="12" REF="001769_0013_0FB8259B8CF64C60">5. The right Execution of the Civil Ru|lers Office in part, con&s;i&s;teth in their making a right and ju&s;t Deci&s;ion of <HI>Controver&s;ies,</HI> in matters of <HI>Meum &amp; Tuum,</HI> depending between Per&s;ons that are &s;ubject to their Authority, &amp; that according to the rules of the Law One End of Civil Government, is, That Contro|versies of a Civil Nature might be well i&s;&s;ued, and that men might not be Judges in their own Ca&s;es, &amp; endeavour to right them&s;elves, <HI>Vi &amp; Armis</HI>; when they think they are wronged, which would be de&s;tructive to any State: And therefore God hath in&s;tituted the Civil Magi&s;trates Office among men, and &s;et up Rulers, that they might Judge righte|ous Judgment between a Man &amp; his Neigh|bour, and i&s;&s;ue the Quarrel by a righteous Sentance, binding to both Parties. This was God's Command by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to the Seventy Elders, that they &s;hould Judge Righteou&s;ly in Controver&s;ies of this nature; as we &s;ee in <HI>Deut.</HI> 1.16. <HI>And I charged your Judges at that time, &s;aying Hear the Cau&s;es between your Bre|thren, Judge Righteously between every man and his Brother, &amp; the Stranger that is with him.</HI> And in this kind of Executing Civil Power the Judges &s;hould not re&s;pect Per&s;ons, but Cau&s;es only: The <HI>Rich</HI> Should not be favoured in Judgment, becau&s;e he is <HI>Rich</HI>; nor the <HI>Poor</HI> carry his Cau&s;e to his mind becau&s;e he is <HI>Poor,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="001769_0014_0FB8259D0A54B6E0">
when the right according to the Rules of the Law is not on his &s;ide; neither &s;hould the <HI>Vertuous</HI> man gain Judgment in his favour, be|cau&s;e he is <HI>Vertuous</HI>; nor the <HI>Vicious</HI> man loo&s;e the Cau&s;e becau&s;e he is <HI>Vicious</HI> (in matters of a Civil concern) when the Law di&s;covers the right to be on his &s;ide. The rule given by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> to the Judges in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> was; as in <HI>Deut.</HI> 1.17 <HI>Thou &s;halt not re&s;pect Per&s;ons in Judg|ment; but &s;hall hear the &s;mall as well as the great.</HI></P>
<P>This Enquiry being Re&s;olved in &s;ome mea|&s;ure; the thing that is next to be attended, is the Proving of the Doctrine in both the Branches of it.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>That the frequent Reading &amp; Stu|dying the Scripture, is a thing Needful and Profi|table for Civil Rulers, &amp;c.</HI> This will appear if we Con&s;ider the&s;e things.</P>
<P N="1">1. By frequent Reading and Studying the Scripture, Civil Rulers will be likely to be men of Religion &amp; good Con&s;cience: And Religion is very &s;erviceable to the regular managing the affairs of Civil Government. It was told <HI>Timothy,</HI> in 2 Tim. 3 15. <HI>That the knowledge of the holy Scriptures, was able to make him wi&s;e to Salvation.</HI> Now, if Rulers become wi&s;e to Salvation, thro' the knowledge of the Scriptures, gain'd by reading &amp; &s;tudy; they will be Wi&s;e al&s;o in ordering the Affairs of
<PB N="14" REF="001769_0015_0FB8259E82727700">
Civil Government under their care; or will order them the more Wi&s;ely. If Rulers are men really Godly, have &amp; maintain the true Fear of God before their eyes; they will en|deavour to execute their re&s;pective Offices well, &s;o as to attain the right ends of Civil Government: As <HI>Nehemith</HI> &s;aid of his Bro|ther <HI>Hanani,</HI> Neh. 7.2 That he gave him Charge over <HI>Jeru&s;alem, Because he was a faith|ful man, and one that feared God above many.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. By frequent Reading and Studying the Scriptures, Civil Rulers may learn how to ex|ert their Civil Power aright, for the glory of God &amp; the good of the People. It is &s;et down in the Scriptures, what is the Nature &amp; End of the Civil Magi&s;trates Office: As in Rom. 13.3, 4. <HI>Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? Do that which is good, &amp; thou &s;halt have prai&s;e of the &s;ame: For he is the Mini&s;ter of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be a|fraid; for he beareth not the &s;word in vain: For he is the Mini&s;ter of God, a revenger to execute wrath on him that doth evil.</HI> So in Lev. 19.15. <HI>Ye &s;hall do no Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s on Judgment; thou &s;hall not re&s;pect the per&s;on of the Poor, nor honour the per&s;on of the Mighty: but in Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;halt thou Judge thy Neighbour.</HI> So in a Chron. 19.6, 7 <HI>And &s;aid to the Judges, take heed what ye do: for ye Judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is
<PB N="15" REF="001769_0016_0FB825A115E3BE98">
with you in the Judgment. Wherefore now, let the fear of the Lord be upon you, take heed &amp; do it: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, nor taking of Gifts.</HI> Thus when Civil Rulers, learn their Duty as Rulers out of the Scriptures, they are the more likely to well execute their re&s;pective Offices; and thus Reading &amp; Studying the Scriptures, is a thing very needful, &amp; profitable for them.</P>
<P N="3">3. The frequent Reading and Study of the Scriptures keepeth fre&s;h in the Memory of Rulers, the Examples of &s;undry Good Rulers in old time, who&s;e Examples of right Ruling, are recorded in the Scriptures for Imitation. And as Examples, are more prevalent than Precepts, in &s;ome things; &s;o they are not without their u&s;efulne&s;s in the affairs of Civil Government. The Record of the Examples of tho&s;e good Rulers of old, and the Ble&s;&s;ings that followed them as a Reward of their Faithfulne&s;s in Government, hath a great tendency to influence the minds of pre&s;ent Rulers, to a vigorous di&s;charge of their Duty, as &s;uch; that they may be the recipient Sub|jects of the &s;ame Ble&s;&s;ings. And thus Read|ing and Studying the Scriptures is a thing needful &amp; profitable for all Rulers, Supreme or Subordinate. The Scripture Examples of good Rulers are tho&s;e, of <HI>David, Jeho&s;haphat, Hezekiah</HI>; and other Godly Kings, who Ruled
<PB N="16" REF="001769_0017_0FB825A249081688">
well; and God &s;how'red down many Ble&s;&s;ings upon them.

The frequent Reading &amp; Studying the Scriptures, impre&s;&s;eth on the minds of Rulers tho&s;e accounts of Evil Rulers, in old time, recorded in the Scriptures, &amp; the Judgments of God that fell upon them, for their Sins and Errors in Government; which hath a ten|dency to di&s;&s;wade pre&s;ent Rulers, whether Su|perior or Inferior, from the like evil practi&s;es in Government, left being found in the like Sins, the like Judgments &s;hould alight upon them also: For tho&s;e things written in for|mer times, were for our admonition &amp; cauti|on, as well as &s;ome of them for our imitation. And thus the Reading &amp; Studying the Scrip|tures, is needful &amp; profitable for Rulers. In the Scriptures there is Recorded the wicked Reigns of <HI>Jereboam, Ahab, Ahaz,</HI> &amp; <HI>Zedekiah</HI>; and other Ungodly Kings &amp; Rulers, on whom the wrath of God fell in the terrible effects of it in out|ward
<PB N="17" REF="001769_0018_0FB825A3A0343F58">
Judgments, brought on them and their Hou&s;es; for their wickedne&s;s in Government. Very Remarkable is <HI>Ahab</HI>'s ca&s;e; who by a wicked act in Government had di&s;&s;ei&s;ed righ|teous <HI>Naboth</HI> of his Vineyard, &amp; his Life al&s;o: but God meets him by his Prophet <HI>Elijah</HI>; as in I <HI>King.</HI> 21.19. Upon the &s;ame &s;pot of ground he had &s;o unrighteou&s;ly gotten, with a dread|ful Threatning, which came exactly to pa&s;s; <HI>in the place where the Dogs licked the blood Na|both, there &s;hall they lick thy blood, even thine.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The Scriptures containeth a Body of Po|litical Statutes, which altho' they were in&s;ti|tuted by God as the Civil Law of the Com|mon Wealth of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> only; yet many of them are of a general Nature, and are founded in natural Equity; and &s;o are as &s;uitable for o|ther Nations, States &amp; Kingdoms, as for God's <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of old; conformable unto which, &s;undry Chri&s;tian Nations, (and ours in particular) have fram'd many of their Civil Laws. So that upon this account the frequent Reading and Studying the Scriptures brings the Civil Ruler to a better under&s;tanding of the Civil Law, the Rule of right exerting Power of Government; and &s;o is Needful and Profita|ble for all Civil Rulers.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of our own Laws, called <HI>Capital Laws,</HI> are exactly the &s;ame, with the Law given to <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in tho&s;e ca&s;es; and &s;undry other of our

Laws are conformable to, and framed out of the Rea&s;on of tho&s;e Laws recorded in the Scripture; and &s;o the Reading &amp; Studying the Scriptures is very Needful and Profitable for our Rulers, in order to know and under&s;tand the Rule by which they are to Govern us; without the knowledge of which, they can never rightly Execute Judgment for God and for the Good of His People.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>That the frequent Reading and Studying the Civil Law of the Land, is a thing very Needful &amp; Profitable for Civil Rulers.</HI> This will appear if we Con&s;ider the&s;e things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Knowledge and right Understand|ing of the Law, cometh by Reading &amp; Study. <HI>Homo fit Doctus non vi &s;ed &s;epe Legendo</HI>: And the Knowledge of the Law is &s;o needful a thing for Civil Rulers to have; that they can not rightly execute their Civil Office without it: They cannot do Ju&s;tice &amp; Judg|ment without it (except it be by accident, as a blind man may chance to hit the mark) for the Law being the Rule they are to at|tend in Judgment, (and that they are Sworn to attend) how can they do Ju&s;tice, accord|ing to this Rule, unle&s;s they know it? In all affairs what&s;oever, its needful that men know the Rule by which they are to act, otherwi&s;e its as likely their actions will be irregular as

And the wicked tre&s;pa&s;s or ri&s;eth up, and no man is &s;ure of his Inheritance; tho' there be the be&s;t Laws in the world to defend it; becau&s;e he that is to Execute the law is a meer <HI>Child in Knowledge,</HI> and doth not know that righteous Rule by which Controversies are to be de|cided.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Knowledge of the Civil Law which cometh by Reading &amp; Study, is a thing very needful &amp; profitable for Civil Rulers, in that
<PB N="20" REF="001769_0021_0FB825AC71E49D10">
hereby they are enabled to weigh with a ju&s;t Balance, tho&s;e Pleadings of the Law that are frequently offered to their Con&s;ideration, when they are &s;etting on the Seats or Judg|ment; &s;o as to reject Error tho' in never &s;o fine a Dre&s;s; and to receive Arguments of Truth, and be &s;wayed thereby, tho' not &s;et off with &s;o much flowri&s;h of Words. If men that are Rulers and Judges don't know the Law, they are ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon, by more knowing Advocates, that &s;ometimes have a bad Cau&s;e to manage; and &s;o in the i&s;&s;ue the matter is brought to that fatal Cata&s;trophe, that the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> Complaineth of, in I&s;a. 59.14. <HI>Judgment is turned away backward, Ju&s;tice &s;tandeth afar off, Tru&s;h is fallen in the Streets, and Equity can not enter.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Knowledge of the Law of the Land which comes by Reading and Study, is need|ful and profitable for Civil Rulers; in that this good Knowledge gives them good Cou|rage and Fortitude of Mind; or at lea&s;t hath a tendency &s;o to do, without which its a very difficult task for the Civil Magi&s;trate to Ex|ecute his Office aright. If Rulers are afraid on the Seats of Judgment, there is but a little or no Likelihood of their bearing the Sword of Ju&s;tice, &s;o as to make others Fear; &s;o as to be a Terror to Evil doers: And if Rulers have but little knowledge in the Law the

Rule by which they are to Govern, and be Per&s;ons of &s;o much common Sen&s;e as to know they know but little, it hath a natural ten|dency to make them afraid, when in the Ex|erci&s;e of their Civil Power, &s;o every threat|ning Word from a bold &amp; &s;awcy Delinquent, which a wi&s;e Judge wou'd Curb and Puni&s;h, is &s;uch a Lion in the way, to the ignorant Ruler, that it brings him to <HI>a ne plus Ultra</HI>; he dare proceed no further: And &s;o the daring Criminal Offender pa&s;&s;eth with Im|punity.</P>
<P N="4">4. Reading and Studying of the Law, is a thing needful and profitable for Civil Rulers, in that God hath &s;een meet to Enjoyn it on the Chief Ruler in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> even the King upon the Throne; and for &s;uch Rea&s;ons as make it as needful for all Inferiour Rulers. That which God doth Command Rulers to do, as Needful, none may &s;ay is Needle&s;s: Now God expre&s;ly Commandeth, as in our Text; <HI>That the King when he &s;itteth on the Throne of his Kingdom, &s;hould write him a Copy of the Law in a Book; and it &s;hould be with him, &amp; he &s;hould Read therein all the Days of his Life; that he might learn to fear the Lord his God, and to keep all the&s;e Statutes, to do them.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The Reading and, Studying the Civil Law of the Land, by which Knowledge is at|tained, is a thing very needful and profitable

for Rulers; in order to keep up their Credit &amp; Reputation among the People over whom they are to Rule; without which they can't be very Serviceable as Rulers, in their Places. When the People have a contemptible low Thought of the Ruler, and e&s;teem him as a man of little or no Knowledge in the Law, the Rule of Government; they but little Re|gard him, or his Civil Commands, how Ju&s;t &s;o ever they are, and but a little do they Re|gard the Puni&s;hments that the Law layeth upon Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, how great &s;o ever they are; &s;ince they E&s;teem him that is to Exe|cute the Law a meer Child in Knowledge, whom they think they can ea&s;ily delude or affright; And &s;o the great End of Civil Go|vernment is in a manner Lo&s;t, and the Ruler very Un&s;erviceable in his Place.</P>

<P>USE, I. Of INFERENCE or IN|STRUCTION, in a few Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Hence we may learn, <HI>That the Civil Ma|gi&s;trates Office well Executed, is that which re|quires or calls for great Labour &amp; Pains.</HI> Idle|ne&s;s we may &s;ee is incon&s;i&s;tent with the
<PB N="23" REF="001769_0024_0FB825B06F2B5140">
right di&s;charge of Duty in a Civil Ruler. Frequent Reading &amp; Studying, the Scriptures and the Civil Law of the Common Wealth which the Doctrine &s;heweth, is &s;o needful for the Civil Ruler, is Laborious. <HI>Solomon</HI> well ob&s;erves, in Eccl. 12.12. <HI>That much Study is a wearine&s;s to the Fle&s;h.</HI> He that will Qualify him&s;elf for a good Ruler, mu&s;t take Pains. He that thinks a man may be Qualified for the Office of a Civil Ruler without Reading and Study, which takes up Time, and co&s;ts Labour &amp; Pains is much mi&s;taken. Rulers are to bear the weight of Government upon their Shoulders; the &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els the le&s;&s;er Subjects, are to have their dependance upon them, to pre&s;erve them from tho&s;e injurious Oppre&s;&s;ions and other Mi&s;chiefs that they are liable unto: In this &s;en&s;e they are to be as Nails fa&s;tened in a &s;ure place, on which they hang the &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els. As was &s;aid of <HI>Eliakim,</HI> a Chief Ruler in <HI>Judah,</HI> in I&s;a. 22.22, &amp; 24. <HI>I will fa&s;ten him as a Nail in a &s;ure Place,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And they &s;hall hang upon him all the Ve&s;&s;els of &s;maller quantity.</HI> Now what Sup|port can the Civil Ruler afford to the &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els the le&s;&s;er Subjects, that have their dependnnce upon him, for Security &amp; Safety, many ways, unle&s;s he be a man of Know|ledge? And how can Knowledge be attain|ed, without Reading &amp; Study? <HI>Nemo &s;apiens

na&s;citur.</HI> And Reading &amp; Study is Laborious. So upon the whole we &s;ee that the Civil Ru|lers Office well Executed is Laborious.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence we infer, <HI>That men who are care|le&s;s in Reading and Studying the Scriptures, and know but little of the Mind of God contained in the scriptures; are not fit for Civil Rulers.</HI> Hence we may learn, that all Per&s;ons of Athei&s;tical Principles, are unfit for Rulers; and &s;o are all Per&s;ons gro&s;ly Ignorant of the Scriptures: al&s;o all Irreligious Per&s;ons, who &s;hew by their Practical Ungodline&s;s, that they are Unac|quainted with the Law of God that Con|vinceth &amp; Converteth the Soul, Enlightens the Mind, and maketh Wi&s;e the Simple. If Rulers don't fear God, (which is gain'd in great part by the frequent u&s;e of the Scrip|tures) what may be expected from them, but that as often as they can do it, and pa&s;s with impunity, (which they have great advantage for, con&s;idering the Sphere of E|levation which they are placed in) <HI>they will Sell the Righteous for Silver, and the Poor for a Pair of Shoes</HI>? Which the Prophet <HI>Amos</HI> complaineth of, (in <HI>Amos.</HI> 2.6.) as the &s;ad Cu&s;tom of tho&s;e Evil Times. <HI>Abraham</HI> ex|pected no Ju&s;tice would be done him in <HI>A|bimelech</HI>'s Court, but rather that he &s;hould be Slain, tho' an innocent Man; not becau&s;e of
<PB N="25" REF="001769_0026_0FB825B389C6AB98">
the want of Civil Government in that Coun|trey, for that there was, and <HI>Abimelech</HI> was Chief Ruler at that time; but the rea&s;on of his fears and &s;ad expectation, aro&s;e from an apprehen&s;ion he had that there was not the fear of God in that Place; as we may &s;ee in Gen. 20.11. <HI>Becau&s;e I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this Place; and they will Slay me,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3 Hence we may be further in&s;tructed, <HI>That it is not every good Man, who doth really fear God; that is fit for a Civil Ruler</HI>: For &s;ome &s;uch have little or no Knowledge of the Law of the Common Wealth, which Rulers are Bound, nay Sworn to attend in Government; and &s;o not fit, And many times the ca&s;e is &s;o with &s;ome good Men, that they can't qua|lify and fit them&s;elves for good Rulers, tho' men of natural good Abilities; for the ca&s;e is &s;o circum&s;tanced with them, that they can't find Time to gain Knowledge in the law, the Rule of Civil Government; which Knowledge comes by Reading and Study: For their Secular occa&s;ions, needful to be at|tended in order to Support them&s;elves and their Families in this World, ingro&s;&s;eth all their Time; except &s;o much as is requi&s;ite for Natural Comforts, and Religious Du|ties; and &s;o if power of Government &s;hould

be devolved on them, <HI>they cannot be Strong Rods for Scepters to bear Rule.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Hence we learn, <HI>That Rulers &s;hould &s;pend Time and deep Tho't upon the Scriptures and the Civil Law of the Land; in or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r to a right Ad|mini&s;tration of Juftice: as well as to &s;pend what Time is needful in Hearing &amp; Determining Cau&s;es that come before them in Judgment.</HI> Prelimi|nary Preparation in this way, is as needful, as Proceeding with Care and deliberate wi&s;e Coun&s;els when they are upon the Seats of Judgment; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> indeed the latter is not like to be without the former. One Rea&s;on why God Commanded the King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as in our Text; <HI>To write him a Copy of the Book of the Law, and to keep it by him, and to Read therein all the Days of his Life</HI>; was, That he might have &s;o well dige&s;ted the whole Body of the Political Statutes contained therein, in his thoughts; that when he came to apply it to Particular Per&s;ons and Ca&s;es, he might not be at a lo&s;s, but might make a ready wi&s;e &amp; Ju&s;t Deci&s;ion of all Controver&s;ies, according to this Rule. If Judges come upon the Seats of Judgment unprepared as to any precedent Study of the Law; one of the&s;e Mi&s;chiefs ordinarily will en&s;ue, Either Ju&s;tice mu&s;t be delayed, until the Judges have took time to Study the Law referring to &s;uch. Cau&s;es, as
<PB N="27" REF="001769_0028_0FB825B6A0C55BC8">
are depending before them; which is an in|jury to the Subject, many ways: or el&s;e Judg|ment mu&s;t be given ignorantly, which is as like to be wrong, as right; and this will bring all Legal Deci&s;ions to a meer Chance, which will make the righteous Subjects whom the Laws &s;hould Secure and Protect, as un&s;afe in all their be&s;t Enjoyments, as if the Dice were ca&s;t for them.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence we learn, <HI>That the Civil Ruler &s;hould be a man of a good E&s;tate, that he may be able to afford Time to be &s;pent in Reading &amp; Study, in order furni&s;h him with Knowledge in State Affairs, that he might &s;erve the Publick the better.</HI> There are &s;ome Men that would make good Rulers, if that of E&s;tate were not wanting: but for want of this, they are not only apt to be of mean and mercinary Spirits, but are al&s;o unable to &s;pend that Time which is needful in Reading and Study, thereby to Trea&s;ure up Knowledge; and &s;o they are upon this Con&s;ideration uncapable of being good Rulers. And when any Government finds it needful to place Per&s;ons in exalted Stations of Tru&s;t and Civil Power, who are of mean E&s;tates; there &s;hould be &s;ome way found to &s;upply that detect, by afford|ing them &s;uch Supplies out of the.

them, to &s;pend a convenient part of their Time, in Reading and Study that they may &s;erve the Publick the better. And upon this Con&s;ideration of its being needful for Rulers to &s;pend part of their Time (and &s;o di&s;ad|vantage their own E&s;tates) in Reading and Studying the Law, that they may ad|vantage the Publick Intere&s;t; <HI>and be God's Mini&s;ters for good to His People</HI>: I &s;ay upon this Con&s;ideration, it becomes a very ju&s;t, Righteous and Rea&s;onable thing, for the Ruled to Pay Tribute to Rulers: Rom. 13.6, 7 <HI>For this cau&s;e pay you Tribute also; for they are God's Mini&s;ters attending constinually upon this very thing.

We read, Jo&s;h. 22.20. <HI>That one man Sinned, even Achan the Son of Zeri, and Wrath fell upon the whole Congregation of I&s;rael; and that man peri&s;hed not alone in his Iniquity.</HI> Tho&s;e that thus Offend God, and bring Wrath upon His People, &s;hould be Puni&s;hed by the Civil Ma|gi&s;trate according to the Merit of their Offences; and for this rea&s;on the Civil Ma|gi&s;trate is Armed with the Sword, that he might cut off from the Common wealth tho&s;e Wicked Men, who&s;e Crimes merit it; and who are (as gangren'd Members, to the na|tural Body) infectious and de&s;tructive to the whole Body Politick. <HI>En&s;e reciderdum ut ne pars &s;incera trahatur immedicabile Vulnus.</HI>

<P>Suffer me a few words by way of Motive here, in two Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">[1.] For Rulers to bear a &s;evere Te&s;timo|ny against Sin, &amp; Sinners; is the ready way to bring on them&s;elves and their Families a peculiar Ble&s;&s;ing from God. See that Scrip|ture; Numb. 25.12, 13. <HI>Wherefore, behold I give him my Covenant of Peace. And he &s;hall have it,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Becau&s;e he was Zealous for his God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">[2.] For Rulers thus to do, is the way to turn away God's Wrath from a Sinful People, &amp; to lengthen out their Tranquility: Numb. 25, 11. <HI>Phineas the Son of Eleazer, the Son of Aaron the Prie&s;t, hath turned away my Wrath, while he was Zealous for my &s;ake among them.</HI> And &s;o &s;aith God by His Prophet of old; Jer. 5, 1. <HI>Run ye to and fro through the Streets of Je|ru&s;alem, and &s;earch in the broad Ways thereof, if ye can find a Man, to &s;tand up &amp; execute Judg|ment, and &s;eek the Truth, and I will Pardon it.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="35" REF="001769_0036_0FB825CBEA199E50">2. In the Second Place by way of Exhor|tion, I would make my humble Addre&s;s, unto my <HI>Reverend Fathers and Brethren in the MINISTRY</HI>: And tho' it belongs not to us, to execute Judgment for God according to the Statutes of the Land, (as it belonged not to King <HI>Uzziah</HI> to burn Incen&s;e, but to the Prie&s;ts the Sons of <HI>Aaron</HI>;) and &s;o not &s;o needful for us to Read &amp; Study the Civil Law: Yet as Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, and Stewards of the My&s;teries of GOD, and Rulers in His Hou&s;e; it is very Needful and Profitable for us, to Read and Study the Scriptures, in the which the Law of CHRIST is contained. That ought to be the Rule of all our Sacred Admini&s;trations: <HI>Chri&s;t was not le&s;s Faithful in all his Hou&s;e, than Mo&s;es was in his.</HI> And HE is the great Le|gi&s;lator, as well as the King of His Church. And in the Scriptures His Laws are contain|ed, to which we must Conform as &s;trictly in our Mini&s;try and Government, as the Civil Ruler mu&s;t Conform to the Civil Law, as the Rule of the Lawful Exerci&s;e of his Power. Let us therefore Painfully Study this Law of Chri&s;t in all the Parts of it; and make it the Rule of our Practi&s;e, in the performance of all the Duties of our Sacred Calling. To CHRIST our Great Lord and King, we mu&s;t

ere long be Accountable; and the great En|quiry then will be, Whether we have Regu|lated all things, in the Hou&s;e and Wor&s;hip of God <HI>according to the Pattern given in the Mount.</HI> Therefore let us <HI>take a Copy of this Law,</HI> in the Book of the Scriptures; <HI>and let it be with us, and let us Read therein all the Days of our Lives; that we may learn to fear the Lord our God, and to keep all His Commandments and his Statutes, to do them.</HI> In our Mini&s;try and Government, let us bear a due Te&s;timony again&s;t Sin, and Sinners; as did <HI>Phincas</HI> the Son of <HI>Eleazer,</HI> that God may <HI>Ble&s;s us, and E&s;tabli&s;h with us the Covenant of an Everla&s;ting Prie&s;thood, becau&s;e we have been Zealous for His &s;ake among His People.</HI> That bold and daring Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, where the Sword of Civil Power doth not reach, or not &s;ufficiently correct and amend, may be reached and &s;lain by the Sword of the Word: That it may be, as was &s;aid, in 1 King. 19.17. <HI>Him that e&s;capeth the Sword of Jehu, &s;hall Eli&s;ha Slay.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Third Branch of Exhortation may be directed to all &s;uch, who according to the Con&s;titution of our Government, are <HI>Electors of Rulers</HI>; either as they are <HI>Freemen of this Corporation,</HI> or as they are <HI>Members of that Repre&s;entative Body of our Colony,</HI> to whom the Power of Electing Inferiour Rulers doth
<PB N="37" REF="001769_0038_0FB825D0B4B52DE8">
belong. The Advice to you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> is this; <HI>Take care to Choo&s;e &s;uch for Rulers whether Superiour or Subordinate, as are men of Religion, and Knowledge in the Laws.</HI> Such as Con&s;cientiou&s;ly Read and Study the Scrip|ture and the Laws of the Land, that they may do God and His People good Service as Rulers; and be God's Mini&s;ters for good. Don't choo&s;e either Vicious Per&s;ons or Babes in Knowledge, to manage our State Affairs; &s;uch are not fit to have the Charge over our <HI>Jeru&s;alem:</HI> or if they have it can they manage that Charge and Tru&s;t, as becomes good Rulers. And don't choo&s;e Men to Rule over us, meerly becau&s;e they are your par|ticular Friends, and will &s;uit you in &s;ome of your particular De&s;igns &amp; private Intere&s;ts: Neither with-hold your Suffrages from any that are Men of Religion and Knowledge of the Laws, becau&s;e they are not of your Faction, and will not &s;uit with your private Humour and particular Intere&s;ts. If you do guide your Choice by private Favour, Af|fection or Faction, without regard to Publick Good; you will Violate the Solemn Oath of God upon you, and bring your &s;elves under great Guilt; and can not an&s;wer it before God in the Great Day of Account. You ought herein to act in the fear of God, and di&s;carding all re&s;pect to your Private Intere&s;t
<PB N="38" REF="001769_0039_0FB825D220F852A8">
and all Prejudice; aiming at God's Glory, and the Good of His People in general; and as God declares to the Rulers what they mu&s;t do in order to Rule well; viz <HI>Write them a Copy of this Book of the Law, and Read therein,</HI> &amp;c. So tho&s;e you observe mo&s;t Con|formable to this Duty which God requires of Rulers; they are the Per&s;ons for whom you &s;hould give your Suffrages when ever you are called to it.</P>
<P>To you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> who are the <HI>Repre&s;en|tative Body of our Colony,</HI> I would &s;ay one word in &s;pecial; That altho' there may want &s;ome further good Laws to be made, for the Puni&s;hing of Sin, Immorality and Prophanene&s;s, that are too much abounding in our Land (and if that be the Ca&s;e, its your bu&s;ine&s;s to Exerci&s;e your Legi&s;lative Power for that end) yet it may be a matter more highly requi&s;ite in order to Reforma|tion, to put good Laws already made, in due Execution: And your bu&s;ine&s;s herein, is to put into Place of Power, &s;uch Inferiour Ru|lers throughout our &s;everal Tribes, as in their re&s;pective Stations, will put good Laws in due Execution. Such as know the Law, and &s;o are &s;uch as crafty and bold Criminals, or their Advocates and Abetters can not, battle; and &s;uch as have learned the Fear of God out of the Scriptures, and are men of
<PB N="39" REF="001769_0040_0FB825D45FEF2008">
&s;uch Religious and Con&s;cience, that they will be Zealous for God among His People, bear|ing the Sword of Ju&s;tice not in Vain; but &s;o as to be God's Mini&s;ters for good, revengers to execute Wrath upon them that do evil.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> I would by way of Exhortation offer a few words, unto all tho&s;e that are the <HI>Ruled,</HI> Subject to the Authority of Civil Rulers: And the Exhortation to you is, <HI>Take care to Keep the Laws of God, and the good and whole&s;ome Laws of the Common Wealth.</HI> It is as much our Duty to keep the Laws, as its the Duty of our Religious Rulers to inflict the Puni&s;hments of the Law upon us in ca&s;e we are the breakers of it.</P>
<P>And here more Particularly be Exhorted to di&s;charge Four Points of Duty, re&s;pecting our Carriage towards our Rulers, which the Laws of God as well as the Laws of the Government make our e&s;pecial Duty.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) To Honour and Regard them as our Civil Fathers; not Vilifying or Reproaching of them in any of our words or actions; as in Rom. 13.7. <HI>Render therefore to all their Duet,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Honour to whom Honour is due.</HI> So in Exod. 22.18. <HI>Thou &s;halt not revile the gods, nor cur&s;e the Ruler of thy People.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) To Freely and Readily Pay them Tribute for their Serving us as Rulers, and
<PB N="40" REF="001769_0041_0FB825D8363A7240">
being God's Mini&s;ters to us for good: Rom. 13.6, 7. <HI>For this cau&s;e pay you Tribute al&s;o: for they are God's Mini&s;ters, attending continually on this very thing. Render therefore tribute to whom Tribute is Due.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) To Pray for them to the <HI>Eternal Lord Heaven and Earth,</HI> who&s;e Vicegerents they are; that they may be acting in their &s;phere of Exaltation for God's Glory, &amp; our good. To this we are Commanded, 1 Tim. 2.2 <HI>Pray for King's, &amp; all in Place of Authority, that under them we may lead Quiet and Peaceable Lives, in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P N="4">(4) To Submit to them as they are God's Mini&s;ters to Rule over us, and have received their Power from GOD; and are called <HI>Gods</HI> from the dignity of their Office: which Submi&s;&s;ion we mu&s;t render unto them as a Duty which God requires of us, &s;o long as they keep within the limits of their Power in Ruling over us. And this we mu&s;t do not only for fear of their Wrath, but for Con&s;cience &s;ake: For the Rule is, Rom 13.5. <HI>Wherefore ye mu&s;t needs be Subject, not only for Wrath, but al&s;o for Con&s;cience &s;ake.</HI> And God &s;aith, in the Second Ver&s;e of the &s;ame Chap|ter; <HI>Who&s;oever re&s;i&s;teth, re&s;i&s;teth the Ordinance of God: and &s;hall receive to him&s;elf Damnation.</HI></P>
