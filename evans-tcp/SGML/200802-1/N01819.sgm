<HEAD>New NEWS from <HI>Robin&s;on Cru&s;o</HI>'s ISLAND, IN A Letter to a Gentleman at <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving &s;ome time &s;ince re&s;olv'd to do my &s;elf the Honour of writing to You, I at length thro' great difficulty, retired an hour from Noi&s;e and Clamour, the &s;moak of <HI>Coffee-hou&s;es,</HI> and the <HI>&s;uffocating Stench</HI> of <HI>Court-flattery,</HI> (a wonderful Engine in this Pedantick age,) whereby Men of &s;mall fortune and &s;maller merit, ea&s;ily climb to a con&s;iderable pitch of Honour and Greatne&s;s; and <HI>Preferments</HI> are confer'd on none but &s;uch as will <HI>comply</HI> and <HI>conform</HI> to <HI>another's</HI> Pa&s;&s;ion. And without pa&s;&s;ing the ful&s;om Compliments of <HI>Incomparable,</HI> and <HI>Exten&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> I &s;hall hint to you &s;ome Tran&s;actions of Moment, in this part of the Globe, &s;ince the la&s;t printed News from our I&s;land, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> commencing Jail-bird.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002153_0002_0FBC784880262988">The DISTRESSED STATE of our I&s;land, is I confe&s;s a Theme as <HI>melancholly</HI> as 'tis <HI>common.</HI> And if we take but a general Survey of our pre&s;ent Diffi|culties in their various unhappy Circum&s;tances, we &s;hall find too much rea&s;on to conclude them the <HI>begin|ning of Sorrows,</HI> and the dreadful prologue of more Complicated Mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>The Extream <HI>want</HI> of <HI>that,</HI> the love whereof is the root of all Evil, is the univer&s;al Complaint among us: So that there is hot talk that our Salary-Men, who (particularly the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks) have hitherto had an Honourable Support and &s;uitable to their Character, mu&s;t <HI>lower their Top-&s;ails,</HI> and be Content to take their pay in the <HI>produce of the I&s;land.</HI> The blood and vital Spirits of the Body-politick, (I mean the Medium of Exchange) is &s;o near exhau&s;ted as portends a <HI>Certain,</HI> &amp; <HI>Speedy</HI> di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the paper Credit, which is yet out-&s;tanding, is fallen into the hands of a few <HI>wretched Mi&s;ers,</HI> (who&s;e <HI>de&s;ires are Enlarged as Hell,</HI>) who li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s fat bea&s;ts, &s;tand gaping to devour their Indigent but hone&s;t Neighbours, and with hearts more unrelenting by far than his, make their Nece&s;&s;i|tous Circum&s;tances their cur&s;ed opportunity to <HI>Enrich them&s;elves</HI>: and having wre&s;ted their E&s;tates from them for half the Value, they boa&s;t (like tho&s;e Sin|ners <HI>Solomon</HI> Cautions to beware of,) <HI>that they have found precious Sub&s;tance, and filled their hou&s;es with &s;poil.</HI></P>
<P>In what prodigious Shoals do Men flock to U&s;e|rers to <HI>hire</HI>! and perhaps when they have waited at their Gates as long as King <HI>John</HI> did at the Pope's Legat's, they may obtain admittance; and tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s E&s;tates in Lands worth 500l. may pawn them for 94 <HI>for the Intere&s;t must be paid before they receive the Principal</HI>; and be&s;ides that, there mu&s;t be a <HI>gratuity</HI> proportionable to the urgency of their wants, before they can come off &s;o well.</P>
<P>Among the innumerable exorbitant Mi&s;chiefs which
<PB N="3" REF="002153_0003_0FBC784A21EFD208">
ari&s;e from the want of of &s;ome proper Medium of Ex|change, the&s;e are not the lea&s;t: The <HI>Trade,</HI> by which our I&s;land chiefly &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, is <HI>wofully embara&s;s'd</HI>; and many a noble Project (and profitable to the Publick) <HI>&s;adly retarded</HI>; a Multiplicity of <HI>Law-Suits,</HI> to the enriching a few <HI>luxuriant Cut-throats,</HI> and reducing many hone&s;t, frugal, indu&s;trious Familys to <HI>Beggary,</HI> and <HI>many more</HI> to the very precipice of Ruin, unle&s;s &s;peedy Relief intervene. Are not <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion, Inju&s;tice</HI> aud <HI>Cruelty</HI> (like an Innundation) making a <HI>rapid Pro|gre&s;s</HI> among us? And have we not great rea&s;on to fear a more <HI>tragic Scene</HI> will open before we are aware? But on whom mu&s;t we Father all this <HI>Ca|talogue of Mi&s;chiefs</HI> (to which a multitude more might be added) when the black <HI>Master-roll</HI> comes to be made up? Is it not an Argument, that <HI>tho&s;e</HI> who <HI>reject,</HI> and <HI>hi&s;s</HI> at <HI>all</HI> propo&s;als (even the mo&s;t fair and promi&s;ing) which are made by <HI>others,</HI> and <HI>propo&s;e nothing at all</HI> them&s;elves, would have nothing at all <HI>DONE</HI> that might conduce to our Relief &amp; advantage?</P>
<P>Our Expectations of Redre&s;s the <HI>la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion</HI> (the <HI>Expence</HI> and <HI>Damage</HI> whereof has not been much le&s;s than that of <HI>broken Conventions,</HI> with which we were threatned, if the former were not managed according to <HI>&s;ome men's minds</HI>) have been greatly rai&s;ed, and the Repre&s;entative Body of the I&s;land carried on things with great Prudence, as far as po&s;&s;ible; and I need not tell you where their Conclu&s;ions met with a re&s;olute Repul&s;e.</P>
<P>The Oppo&s;ition which the Emi&s;&s;ion of more Paper Credit has met with, has afforded various matter of Speculation among us; and many have been the Con|jectures about it, it being &s;omething unnaccountable what Men &s;hould be driving at, who (like <HI>Water-men</HI>) <HI>look one way,</HI> while at the &s;ame time they <HI>now the contrary</HI>; in&s;omuch that many (who are willing to think the be&s;t) are apt to fix them with the Carca&s;s of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> between Heaven and Earth; or with <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> the Atlas of the Papal Cau&s;e, to whom

the Catholicks (becau&s;e he wrote &s;o much like a Heretick) a&s;&s;ign a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> place, between Heaven and Hell.</P>
<P>The Great D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n of the County of <HI>E&mdash;x,</HI> (who &s;hakes his Rod terribly over the whole County, and makes his Minions cringe at his Feet) was &s;eiz'd with <HI>Bel&s;hazzar's</HI> fit of trembling (tho' doubtle&s;s from an <HI>Infernal Impre&s;&s;ion</HI>) le&s;t the <HI>Bill</HI> &s;hould pa&s;s the B&mdash;d, and his <HI>Deify'd Mammon</HI> cea&s;e to bring in &s;uch a gri|ping U&s;ury as is <HI>calculated to the Meridian of his Con|&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P>There were al&s;o <HI>terrible Alarms</HI> among the whole <HI>C&mdash;s Clan</HI> in this great Cri&s;is, for fear the re&s;ult &s;hould not plea&s;e their <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI>; but &s;ince good Pro|jections have been cru&s;h'd in the Birth, they begin to <HI>hecter</HI> and <HI>bullie</HI> with abundance of Confidence, as if they had gained the Point to <HI>all Intents and Purpo&s;es</HI>; tho' &s;everal of them <HI>want Ca&s;h</HI> as much as their Neighbours.</P>
<P>However, &s;ome of the mo&s;t Judicious and Intelli|gent among us, have ventured to <HI>Query,</HI> whether the following things be not the <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Source</HI> of the forementioned Oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s</HI>: Which con&s;i&s;ts in an <HI>eager</HI> and <HI>in&s;atiable</HI> Thir&s;t after Riches, which hurries Men on in the Acqui&s;ition of Worldly Goods, tho' in the mo&s;t <HI>unju&s;t, injurious</HI> and <HI>clandestine</HI> ways. 'Tis a <HI>Gan|grene</HI> in the Soul, that with a <HI>pay &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Heat,</HI> con&s;umes the Natural Affections, to &s;upply their room with the mo&s;t <HI>virulent Humours.</HI> This <HI>furious De&s;ire</HI> precipi|tates Men on to Oppre&s;&s;ion, Violence and Deceit; &s;o that they will not <HI>stick to betray and &s;ell their Country,</HI> if thereby they can enrich them&s;elves, and promote their private Intere&s;ts; for when this cau&s;ed Lu&s;t has once gain'd the A&s;cendant in the Soul, is it any won|der if men pro&s;titute the Gifts of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Provi|dence,</HI> to the mo&s;t <HI>base</HI> and <HI>&s;ervile</HI> Ends? Nature, in the production of Gold (as one ingeniou&s;ly ob&s;erves) &s;eems to have pre&s;aged the <HI>Mi&s;ery of her Lovers,</HI> by making the place where it grows barren of Herbs,
<PB N="5" REF="002153_0005_0FBC785000693D68">
Plants, &amp;c. intimating thereby that in the Minds where the <HI>De&s;ire</HI> of this Metal &s;hall <HI>take Birth,</HI> no Sparks of <HI>Honour</HI> or <HI>Vertue</HI> &s;hall remain.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Envy</HI>: Which is a <HI>Diabolical Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> that renders tho&s;e in whom it is predominant <HI>Emphatically the Chil|dren of the Devil.</HI> It &s;tirs up in Men a <HI>pining</HI> at the good of others, and <HI>gnaws</HI> their <HI>Hearts</HI> with continual Torment. How do &s;ome <HI>vex</HI> and <HI>frett</HI> them&s;elves, at the pro&s;perity and good of <HI>Others</HI>? And how would they (if they could) <HI>Ahab</HI>-like, hook in their fair E&s;tates? that they may <HI>join Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, &amp; lay Field to Field,</HI> &amp;c. tho' there is a terrible W O denounc'd again&s;t them, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 5. 8.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Pride.</HI> Pride and Envy are Si&s;ters of the &s;ame Complexion and Shape, and equally pernicious in their <HI>Effects.</HI> Ambition is a <HI>ravi&s;hing Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> that ea&s;ily glides into the Soul, but makes an unwilling Retreat. 'Tis a furious De&s;ire, that knows no bounds, but <HI>ab&s;o|lute Lord&s;hip</HI> and <HI>Empire</HI> for <HI>it's &s;elf,</HI> and <HI>Beggary</HI> and <HI>Slavery</HI> for <HI>all others</HI>; which <HI>Age</HI> doth not <HI>mature,</HI> nor <HI>le&s;&s;er Dignities &s;atisfy.</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Gulf</HI> without <HI>Bottom</HI> or <HI>Shore</HI>; the <HI>Vacuum in Nature,</HI> which Philo&s;ophers have not found out, nor ever will.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Hypocri&s;y.</HI> And of <HI>all</HI> the foregoing evils, this is not to be e&s;teem'd the lea&s;t. For <HI>hereby</HI> (as a mo&s;t Reverend Divine ob&s;erves) <HI>Religion</HI> is made a <HI>Stalking-Hor&s;e</HI> whereby <HI>&s;ome Men</HI> &s;erve the mo&s;t vile and un|worthy Ends; cloaking their De&s;igns of <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s, Ambition,</HI> or <HI>Revenge,</HI> with pretence of <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> and <HI>Zeal</HI>; and under the &s;pecious Umbrage hereof, the mo&s;t <HI>execrable Villanies</HI> have been acted. This lurking Evil has &s;lain it's <HI>Ten Thou&s;ands,</HI> and done more mi&s;chief in he World than open Impiety and Infidelity.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;uppos'd to be the four <HI>main Springs,</HI> from whence the Oppo&s;ition to more Bills, (tho' emitted on never &s;o good a Foundation) proceeds. And is it any wonder, that a few <HI>Muck-worms,</HI> who have <HI>monopoliz'd</HI> va&s;t Hoards of Bills &s;hould <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> it; &s;eeing they have &s;o fair a pro&s;pect (as they think) of rai&s;ing their E&s;tates,
<PB N="6" REF="002153_0006_0FBC785196503C08">
and building up their <HI>Names</HI> on the <HI>Ruins</HI> of their Country? Tho' hereby their Memory will be a <HI>Stench</HI> in the No&s;trils of Po&s;terity. For what el&s;e can we &s;uppo&s;e them &s;o furiou&s;ly driving at (unle&s;s we are bound to believe their <HI>Words,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Cour&s;e</HI> and <HI>Tenor</HI> of their <HI>Actions</HI>) but to <HI>engro&s;s</HI> all the <HI>E&s;tates in the I&s;land</HI>; and them&s;elves being <HI>Lords,</HI> the re&s;t by Con&s;equence their <HI>Slaves</HI>?</P>
<P>But will our I&s;landers, who have ever injoyed the Sweets of <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Freedom,</HI> be ea&s;ily drove to <HI>Sla|very</HI> by &s;ome <HI>who&s;e Fathers many of them would have di&s;dained to &s;it with the Dogs of their Flock</HI>? Certain|ly no. And it is <HI>greatly to be hop'd,</HI> that on the 31<HI>st</HI> of <HI>May</HI> next, when the Convention comes together, they will be in&s;pir'd with a Spirit of <HI>true di&s;cerning</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h between them who are <HI>Lovers</HI> of their Country and them who <HI>are not.</HI> Wi&s;dom 2. 12. <HI>They are not for our turn, but are quite Contrary to us.</HI></P>
<P>There has been a great Bu&s;tle and Whi&s;pering of late about our <HI>Constitution</HI>; &amp; rais'd Expectations among <HI>many,</HI> (who&s;e Endeavours have not been wanting) that <HI>tho&s;e glorious Days for Lawyers and Gentlemen,</HI> which were prophe&s;ied of and wi&s;h'd for, <HI>January</HI> 12. 1703, 4, were making a near approach to us. But as hitherto the united attempts of Earth and Hell which have been formed again&s;t it have proved <HI>un&s;ucce&s;sful</HI>; &s;o we hope that He who rules in the Kingdom of Providence, will <HI>deride</HI> their &s;ecret Coun&s;els, <HI>defeat</HI> their De&s;igns (tho' laid as deep as Hell) and <HI>cloath them</HI> with Shame and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> It is no <HI>News</HI> to you (I pre&s;ume) that the great DON-DAGO, the <HI>Primate-wou'd-be</HI> of our I&s;land, (like the famous Dr. <HI>S&mdash;l</HI> has long ago <HI>burst his Orb, and become Eccentrick.</HI> And as for the Old <HI>Itch of Scribling,</HI> (tho' plung'd in the profound <HI>Atlantic</HI>) it is not yet extingui&s;h'd.</P>
<P>Some time &s;ince we &s;aw the Meteor call'd <HI>Aurora-Borealis</HI>; which is a forerunner of <HI>News</HI> from the <HI>North,</HI> and not long after we heard of a <HI>venomous Epi&s;tle,</HI> that
<PB N="7" REF="002153_0007_0FBC78546BA5EF58">
has been &s;ent to <HI>your Parts,</HI> (with which the World may be favoured, if it can find a place among <HI>Tom Brown's</HI> Letters, the next Impre&s;&s;ion) wherein the Wri|ter (as he has formerly convinc'd the World of his <HI>ex|qui&s;ite Knack at daubing with untempered Mortar</HI>) has given us to under&s;tand, that he is Ma&s;ter of the Art of <HI>enviou&s;ly detracting</HI> from the worth of good Men, (<HI>Gentlemen of known Integrity</HI>) by throwing dirt, to &s;ully their Reputation, and blacken their Character. Moreover, he has repre&s;ented a <HI>loyal</HI> and <HI>peaceable</HI> Peo|ple, as <HI>Factious, Turbulent, and wor&s;e than the Savage Monsters of Africa.</HI></P>
<P>Some of our Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks of late, (for want of <HI>Di&s;cretion,</HI> without which <HI>Learning</HI> is <HI>Pedantry,</HI> and <HI>Wit, Impertinence,</HI>) have been guilty of <HI>too officious</HI> a meddling with <HI>State Affairs.</HI> The great &s;ub&s;tantial Duties of <HI>Faith, Repentance,</HI> and a <HI>good Life,</HI> are what they <HI>may</HI> and <HI>ought,</HI> with utmo&s;t Warmth and Energy to <HI>Inculcate</HI>; but whatever is not compris'd in the&s;e, is <HI>be&s;ide the Text, foreign to their Province, and another Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;ee a Clergy-man (<HI>Commedian</HI>-like) &s;tand <HI>bela|bouring his Cu&s;hion</HI> and intermixing his Harrangue with THUNDER-BOLTS, while he is entertaining his <HI>peaceable Congregation</HI> with things whereof he is almo&s;t as <HI>Ignorant,</HI> as I am of the <HI>Saddle</HI> Balaam <HI>rode on</HI> when his A&s;s &s;poke, and exhorting them to <HI>beware of a mutinons, mobbi&s;h Spirit, of &s;iding with this or that Party and Intere&s;t</HI>; How <HI>ridiculous</HI> is the Sight and the Sound? How <HI>nauceous,</HI> and like a <HI>Parable in the Mouth of Fools</HI>? An empty noi&s;e, like <HI>&s;ounding Bra&s;s,</HI> or a <HI>tinkling Cymbal.</HI></P>
<P>How do &s;uch Degrade their <HI>Sacred Function,</HI> and expo&s;e them&s;elves to <HI>Contempt</HI> and <HI>Mimickry,</HI> and to be <HI>Burlisqu'd</HI> by every Pamphleteer? And how high|ly meritorous is this of a <HI>Staff</HI> and Pair of <HI>Shoes.</HI></P>
<P>But, is not the Crime exceedingly aggravated, when any of that <HI>Order</HI> &s;ide with <HI>Parties,</HI> and foment <HI>Diffe|rences</HI> THEMSELVES? When in their <HI>private Vi&s;its</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="002153_0008_0FBC7856CD103D00">
and at <HI>Gentlemens Tables,</HI> they take the Licence to <HI>revile, backbite</HI> and <HI>&s;lander,</HI> endeavouring to <HI>widen</HI> the Differences between Men of <HI>high Station</HI> and <HI>Character,</HI> who&s;e Influence is likely to affect the whole I&s;land? Does not this render them <HI>vile,</HI> and mini&s;ter ju&s;t Occa&s;ion to ungodly Men to <HI>de&s;pi&s;e their Offerings</HI>?

<P>But I mu&s;t not be further tedious to you, becau&s;e I hope in a &s;hort time to &s;end you a more particular Account of things: In the mean time, recommending you and yours to the Care of the Divine Providence,</P>
