<Q>For he is the Mini&s;ter of <HI>GOD</HI> to thee for good.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is the appropriate privilege of chri&s;tianity, to afford doctrines and precepts adapted to the circum&s;tances of all characters of men. Other &s;y&s;tems of morality are partial in their in&s;truc|tions, deficient in motives, and erroneous in the maxims of human life. But the author of our &s;aith hath grounded our obligations upon a ra|tional foundation, excited us to duty by &s;uitable and efficient motives, and extended his in&s;tructions to every cla&s;s of men. With equal regards he re|&s;pects the wi&s;e and the noble, the unin&s;tructed and him of low degree. To render his &s;y&s;tem the more beneficial, he has appointed mini&s;ters to ex|plain its principles, and inculcate his &s;aving doc|trines upon men of all degrees; to vindicate and magnify his in&s;titutions before Kings, and to preach the go&s;pel to the poor.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="020469_0006_0FAF0CEE2C976F90">
AND this is the mini&s;ter's happine&s;s, that he is ready furni&s;hed with in&s;tructions &s;uited to every auditory before whom he may &s;peak. All men need in&s;truction, to be prompted to the di&s;charge of their &s;upreme obligations to God, and their re|lative obligations to each other. And this is their common privilege, that the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us by his written word and preached go&s;pel, provides for all <HI>a portion in due &s;ea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>THE words &s;elected for the ba&s;is of a di&s;cour&s;e upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, contain in&s;truction for rulers; to point them to the origin of their power and the u&s;e they &s;hould make of it: They com|prize a le&s;&s;on equally u&s;eful to &s;ubjects; how to conduct them&s;elves in relation to their rulers, and what views to entertain of their authority.</P>
<P>SHOULD the Preacher conform him&s;elf to the text, and place to view the &s;olemn importance of it, the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion might be richly profitable to this great a&s;&s;embly. May that Divine Teacher, <HI>who &s;pake as never man &s;pake,</HI> by the aids of his Spirit, a&s;&s;i&s;t the Preacher <HI>to find out acceptable words and the words of truth and &s;oberne&s;s;</HI> to recommend his doctrines in their purity and power to his &s;er|vants, now convened to learn the law in his &s;anctuary.</P>

<HI>For he is the mini&s;ter of God to thee for good.</HI></P>
<P>OUR fir&s;t enquiry is, Who is this mini&s;ter of God? The context informs us, that <HI>he is the civil magi&s;|trate,</HI> called in a preceding pa&s;&s;age, <HI>the higher powers,</HI> &s;ince the magi&s;trate is rai&s;ed in the com|munity to a &s;tation above his brethren, and in|tru&s;ted with authority to govern others, by or|daining and executing laws for the common good. That magi&s;trates are de&s;ignated by the Apo&s;tle, appears from his terming them, <HI>Rulers who are not a terror to good works, but to the evil;</HI> they are appointed to &s;upport good morals and puni&s;h vice. And this part of the de&s;cription agrees with the civil magi&s;trate, <HI>He is a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil:</HI> And as an acknowledge|ment of his &s;ervices and dignity, <HI>he receives tribute.</HI> It is thus evident from the Apo&s;tle's calling him <HI>the Higher Powers, the Ruler and the Revenger,</HI> that the <HI>civil magi&s;trate</HI> is intended by <HI>the mini&s;ter of God.</HI> In &s;peaking upon this &s;ubject, four general pro|po&s;itions will merit our attention, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That civil authority is of divine in&s;titution.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That civil authority is in&s;tituted for the good of the people in general, and for the benefit of the church of Chri&s;t in particular.</ITEM>

IV. What are the obligations of &s;ubjects to the civil authority?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>1. Civil authority is of Divine in&s;titution.</P>
<P><HI>He is the mini&s;ter of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Order is Heaven's fir&s;t law.</HI> Without it the gracious de&s;igns of the Creator cannot be accom|pli&s;hed. He has made his creatures of various powers and degrees; ri&s;ing by an ea&s;y and happy gradation, from the lowe&s;t &s;pecies of animals, to the mo&s;t exalted rank of heavenly intelligencies. Creatures of the &s;ame &s;pecies are con&s;tituted with certain differences, by which they greatly excel each other. Men, who are &s;aid to be born in a &s;tate of equality, are yet endowed with unequal mea&s;ures of &s;trength and wi&s;dom. And hence there is a greater variety among&s;t men, than among&s;t &s;everal different &s;pecies of animals. Some are qualified to teach and guide; others to be taught and led by their &s;uperiors. To affirm that in the qualifications to rule and guide, all men are equal, is to blend characters totally diver&s;e, to confound wi&s;dom with folly, and affability and conde&s;cen&s;ion with ill-nature and pride. There have ever been di&s;tinctions in the world, and various degrees among&s;t men; while endowed
<PB N="9" REF="020469_0009_0FAF0CF1F247A4A0">
with &s;uch various qualities and affections, the di&s;|tinction will remain. To gain&s;ay this di&s;tinction, is to counteract one of the principal laws of hu|manity. Some mu&s;t be in authority; others in &s;ubordination. And happy is that people who are allowed in Providence, to look out from among their brethren per&s;ons of the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition, and mo&s;t aptly qualified to rule over them.</P>
<P>THAT particular per&s;ons &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed and exalted in &s;ociety, may be argued from the methods of Providence, ever &s;ince man hath been upon earth. No people were ever able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t for any length of time, without forming into &s;ome kind of civil government, and &s;etting a&s;ide tho&s;e boa&s;ted equalities, with which men are born into the world. They mu&s;t be &s;ubject to &s;ome common rule and authority, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s any mea&s;ure of happine&s;s and &s;ecurity. Where there are no rulers to govern the community, all things are immediately involved in confu&s;ion and mi&s;ery. The continuance of our original equality, is a &s;tate of nature, and all ages have found a &s;tate of nature to be a &s;tate of war. Therefore it has plea&s;ed the common Parent of men, to lead them to a &s;tate of civil &s;ubordination, by which a part of the community are intru&s;ted to ordain and carry into effect, laws and regulations for the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="020469_0010_0FAF0CF2AEA3E548">
THAT the e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil government is by the coun&s;el and wi&s;dom of God, we are taught both from the hi&s;tory of his Providence, and the te&s;timony of his in&s;pired truth. I&s;rael, the people of his love, were formed into a civil community, and made &s;ubordinate to e&s;tabli&s;hed laws, to be admini&s;tered by rulers appointed for that purpo&s;e. And it was a time of &s;ore rebuke, when there was no magi&s;trate in the land of &s;ufficient authority, to put them in fear. The exaltation and degradation of rulers is the work of God, and not the pro|duction of a blind and fortuitous chance, accord|ing to the opinion of idle and infidel wits. <HI>For</HI> &s;aith the word of enlightning truth,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm, lxxv. 6, 7.</NOTE> <HI>Promotion cometh neither from the ea&s;t, nor from the we&s;t, nor from the &s;outh. But God is the Judge; he putteth down one and &s;etteth up another.</HI> The prerogative of or|daining magi&s;tracy and civil authority, belongs to our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; this claim he a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf under the name of Wi&s;dom.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. viii. 15, 16.</NOTE> <HI>"By me Kings reign and Princes decree ju&s;tice. By me Princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth."</HI> The&s;e words imply the power of God, in &s;upporting civil authority, and al&s;o his approbation of civil
<PB N="11" REF="020469_0011_0FAF0CF36B705C80">
magi&s;tracy, as one of the ble&s;&s;ings of the Redeemer's purcha&s;e. In what e&s;timation the ble&s;&s;ing of civil government is holden by God, may be learned from that apo&s;tolical direction to Titus, how to teach the flock of Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Titus, iii. 1.</NOTE> <HI>"Put them in mind to be &s;ubject to principalities and powers, and to obey magi&s;trates."</HI> So far is Chri&s;t intere&s;ted in the &s;up|port of civil authority, that he will acknowledge tho&s;e only to be his followers, who willingly obey rulers, and &s;ubmit to their admini&s;trations.</P>
<P>BUT we need not go far for arguments: Our text is encompa&s;&s;ed with proofs of the Divine in|&s;titution of civil authority. The argument in the fir&s;t ver&s;e, for &s;ubjection to the <HI>higher powers,</HI> is, <HI>For there is no power but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God.</HI> The rea&s;on alledged for not op|po&s;ing <HI>the power,</HI> is in the &s;econd ver&s;e. <HI>Who&s;oever re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God&punc; and they that re&s;i&s;t &s;hall receive to them&s;elves damnation.</HI> Thrice in this argument the Apo&s;tle &s;tiles the magi&s;trate, <HI>God's mini&s;ter;</HI> that is, a public &s;ervant appointed by God. He is &s;tiled al&s;o God's <HI>revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</HI> And Chri&s;tians mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only from fear and con&s;traint, but chearfully in di&s;charge of
<PB N="12" REF="020469_0012_0FAF0CF440BC4F08">
a good con&s;cience. Therefore our argument for the Divine in&s;titution of civil authority, re&s;ts upon the uniformity of Providence, in bringing man|kind under government; upon the clear te&s;timony of &s;cripture; and upon our Lord's repeated in|&s;tructions to his di&s;ciples to yield a willing homage to rulers, even when they are neither of their faith, nor even of exemplary morals.</P>
<P>NOT that God hath ordained any particular form of Government. This is left to the judge|ment of men, and the circum&s;tances of particular countries and communities. But &s;ome govern|ment is nece&s;&s;ary. God wills mankind to be in &s;ubordination, and that they &s;tand to each other in the relation of rulers and &s;ubjects. He does not &s;et up the claim of Kings, to an indefea&s;ible and hereditary right: Such a claim is without &s;upport in &s;cripture, and is repugnant to common &s;en&s;e. The leading idea of &s;cripture is, That com|munities con&s;titute certain of their brethren to rule over them: and thus con&s;tituted, they are the <HI>ordinance</HI> of the Supreme Ruler.</P>
<P>OUR argument is not, That every power which a&s;&s;umes to be authority is really &s;o; or that God would have it acknowledged as his in&s;titution.
<PB N="13" REF="020469_0013_0FAF0CF6CADBF010">
U&s;urpers and incurable tyrants are not the ordi|nance of God. Invaders are to be rejected as ho&s;tile to civil authority and &s;ubver&s;ive of govern|ment&punc; The Apo&s;tle would &s;how, That rulers allowed by long u&s;e, &s;ubmitted to by promi&s;es of allegiance, or introduced according to the &s;tated maxims of the community over whom they pre|&s;ide, are inve&s;ted with power by God him&s;elf, and are to be obeyed by Chri&s;tians as his ordinance; and this, however their characters may be faulty, and their admini&s;trations in many re&s;pects inju|dicious and reprehen&s;ible.</P>
<P>I proceed to prove,</P>
<P>II. THAT civil authority is in&s;tituted for the good of the people in general, and for the benefit of the church of Chri&s;t in particular.</P>
<P><HI>He is the Mini&s;ter of God to</HI> THEE <HI>for</HI> GOOD.</P>
<P>THAT God has in&s;tituted civil authority for the common good, is a full demon&s;tration, that he utterly abhors that tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, which is &s;o frequently practi&s;ed by the in&s;olent Rulers of the earth: His benevolence is incen&s;ed at the abu&s;e of his gifts, and the perver&s;ion of tho&s;e powers and talents which he has be&s;towed upon magi&s;trates for the happine&s;s of his creatures. Rulers, who mi&s;apply their authority for their
<PB N="14" REF="020469_0014_0FAF0CF7BAD13870">
per&s;onal advantage, and u&s;e the force of the State, to feed their ambition and revenge, or to gratify the guilty pa&s;&s;ions of minions and favourites, at the expence of publick mi&s;ery, are &s;ingular objects of Divine re&s;entment, and a &s;trange puni&s;hment is prepared for them by the righteous <HI>Avenger.</HI> No man has authority from God for partial advantage, but for the com|mon good. And while God &s;uffers &s;uch rulers to hold dominion among men, he utterly abhors the inju&s;tice and wickedne&s;s of their admini&s;tra|tions; he will bring to &s;wift de&s;truction the&s;e haughty oppre&s;&s;ors of the nations, and proportion his plagues to their violence, and to the &s;orrows which they have produced to their fellow men. He will eventually &s;hew his power, and make his wrath known in their wonderful perdition.</P>
<P>BUT let none imagine, that God has no gracious purpo&s;es to an&s;wer by an iniquitous admini&s;tra|tion of civil government. In&s;atiable oppre&s;&s;ors, bloody conquerors and imperial butchers, are of u&s;e in the &s;cheme of Providence, to correct and amend the revolting tribes of men. While they make the earth to tremble, and turn fruitful fields into a de&s;olate wilderne&s;s, they are the me&s;&s;engers of divine di&s;plea&s;ure, the rod of God's anger, and the &s;taff of his indignation, again&s;t an hypocritical
<PB N="15" REF="020469_0015_0FAF0CF909A807D8">
and rebellious people. If a wi&s;e and merciful ad|mini&s;tration will not correct the di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of an obdurate people, God &s;courges them with the &s;tings of &s;corpions, with the relentle&s;s cruelty and ambition of unprincipled tyrants Such di&s;pen|&s;ations are nece&s;&s;ary, both to reclaim the di&s;obe|dient, and as an example of retributive ju&s;tice up|on the incorrigible, that others may &s;hun the rocks on which they &s;plit.</P>
<P>GOD's judgments are full of mercy. That greate&s;t temporal calamity which men experience, an unrighteous admini&s;tration of civil power, has yet a gracious mixture of compa&s;&s;ion, and tends to make perfect the &s;cheme of Providence.</P>
<P>BUT a good and equal admini&s;tration of govern|ment, is a ble&s;&s;ing to the community in a different &s;en&s;e. The enjoyments and tranquility of &s;ubjects are &s;ecured by the protection of rulers. To ad|vance general happine&s;s, to &s;ecure property, to in|crea&s;e true, rational liberty, and to pre&s;erve the lives of men, are the original purpo&s;es for which civil laws and magi&s;trates are ordained by heaven. The Supreme Ruler has given to magi&s;trates no warrant to pur&s;ue unequal or partial mea&s;ures; to con&s;ult per&s;onal or family intere&s;ts; nor to fo&s;ter
<PB N="16" REF="020469_0016_0FAF0CF96D7E87B8">
the wi&s;hes and pur&s;uits of cringing favourites.&mdash;The &s;word of the &s;tate is not committed to them for the exclu&s;ive advantage of particular &s;ocieties or cla&s;&s;es of men. To promote the general good, to cheri&s;h virtue, and to diffu&s;e joyous pro&s;perity through the whole community, are the ends for which God has exalted them to power. And they may pur&s;ue the intere&s;ts of individuals, only in con&s;i&s;tency with the public benefit. The de&s;ign of their in&s;titution, is to encourage virtue, to pro|tect good men, to frown upon the cour&s;es of the wicked, and to repre&s;s that fraud and inju&s;tice, by which oppre&s;&s;ors con&s;ume the faithful of the land, and devour the widow and him who hath no helper.</P>
<P>OUR Apo&s;tle would teach the civil authority, that the great objects of their care, are to cheri&s;h virtue, and extirpate vice; to avenge public and individual wrongs; to curb the exce&s;&s;es of &s;elfi&s;h avarice and ambition, and to fo&s;ter that philan|thropy and integrity, by which alone, nations can be built up and e&s;tabli&s;hed. And they would do well to remember, that not only the general wel|fare of the community is a principal object with all rulers who pur&s;ue the end of their appointment, but that God requires of them, a con&s;tant and
<PB N="17" REF="020469_0017_0FAF0CFA37257A38">
watchful attention to the happine&s;s of the church of Chri&s;t; and for this plain rea&s;on, that magi|&s;trates can in no way &s;o &s;ub&s;tantially promote the common good, as by honouring the doctrines and followers of Je&s;us. Whatever infidel wits may dream to the contrary, Je&s;us Chri&s;t is appointed by the Father to an univer&s;al kingdom.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John, v. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>For the Father hath committed all judgment to the Son.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 1. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>And gave him to be head over all things to the Church.</HI> By him Kings reign, and at his plea&s;ure he &s;ets up and ca&s;ts down all human rule and authority.

As the Governor of all States, he will be acknowledged Supreme, <HI>&s;itting in the a&s;&s;emblies of the mighty, and judging among the Gods.</HI> States who have heard of Chri&s;t and his exaltation, and give him no public acknowledge|ments, are profanely impious again&s;t the Father and the Son, and may well fear the wrath of the Lamb. Let rulers then receive their power, as proceeding from Chri&s;t, and by &s;olemn te&s;timonies of re&s;pect to him and to his di&s;ciples, honour him as their Sovereign: And thus <HI>ki&s;s the Son, le&s;t he be angry and they peri&s;h from the way.</HI> They are ordained for the particular benefit of the Church, for the pro&s;perity of which, all the wheels of Pro|vidence,

and all the revolutions of empire, have been in motion from the morning of time. It &s;hould lie upon the minds of rulers, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who make a profe&s;&s;ion, <HI>that they believe the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion,</HI> to honour Chri&s;t by a true profe&s;&s;ion, and an an&s;werable life, and by their immediate regards in all their admini&s;trations, to the pro&s;perity and dignity of Chri&s;t's family upon earth. This is God's governing end in their ap|pointment to rule, that his children <HI>may lead peacea|ble and quiet lives in godline&s;s and hone&s;ty.</HI> It is a gro&s;s mi&s;take, an affront upon the Lord of all worlds, to affirm, that civil magi&s;trates have no|thing to do for the church of Chri&s;t. Their para|mount Sovereign, has taught them, that they can|not di&s;charge their civil tru&s;t, without a diligent attention to his church upon earth. As well may the mini&s;ter of an earthly Prince alledge, that he has nothing to do for the peace and dignity of his ma&s;ter's family, as civil rulers can alledge, that they have no concern with the church, the family of the King of Zion. The magi&s;trates mo&s;t a&s;&s;i|duous and unwearied labours are due by his ap|pointment to the church of God.</P>

<P>THE God of Heaven, who &s;etteth up Kings, and removeth Kings at his plea&s;ure, gives to rulers the kingdom, &s;trength, power, and glory, for the be|nefit of his people.

<P>LOVE is the main &s;pring of every interchange of kind offices among&s;t men.

IGNORANT and uninformed State&s;men, how|ever hone&s;t in their intentions, can do very little for the happine&s;s of the community. Their limit|ed views create local prejudices, and &s;ubject them to the artifices of intere&s;ted politicians. While a part of the community make undue advantages of their ignorant mi&s;management, the body lan|gui&s;hes and withers away for want of coun&s;el, energy and uniformity in the civil admini&s;tra|tion. It concerns rulers, therefore, to be well ac|quainted with the tempers, capacities, views and intere&s;ts of the citizens, in all parts of their govern|ment, that they may adapt their admini&s;tration to the advantage of the whole, without material in|jury to individuals. Rulers unacquainted with the intere&s;ts of the &s;everal profe&s;&s;ions, and the re|putation and capacities of the principal characters, will make grievous mi&s;takes in government, by confining their labours to a narrow circle, and by lo&s;ing the &s;ervices of the mo&s;t &s;uitable men in the community.

<P>IT is a &s;ad time, when rulers are &s;o inattentive to ju&s;tice and veracity, that truth falleth in the &s;treets, and he who departeth from iniquity, maketh him|&s;elf a prey.

Co|vetou&s;ne&s;s and prodigality are both mi&s;chievous vices in rulers, and they &s;hould avoid each ex|treme, if they would be ble&s;&s;ings to the people.</P>
<P>INDOLENT rulers will be otherways vicious. Idlene&s;s will cloud their minds and extingui&s;h the nobler &s;en&s;ations of the &s;oul, and the mo&s;t noxious weeds will &s;pring up in their place. By their ex|ample, habits of idlene&s;s, intemperance, di&s;&s;ipation, gaming and profanene&s;s, like &s;ome infectious con|tagion, will &s;pread through all ranks of people.

Such wicked rulers will rule over a poor, worthle&s;s people; the com|munity will &s;ink into effeminacy, dependance and wretchedne&s;s.

All delays of ju&s;tice, the exemption from cha&s;ti&s;ement, which corrupt citi|zens receive in breaking the peace and violating the ordinances of ju&s;tice, is a &s;ore malady in the State, and proves that the head is &s;ick and the heart faint. Good magi&s;trates, by their influence, &s;uppre&s;s immorality, and every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of re|lative ju&s;tice.

And the magi&s;trate who does not endeavour to puni&s;h and reclaim, or ut|terly to purge from the State wicked and di&s;obe|dient &s;ubjects, forgets the main de&s;ign of his ex|altation.

<P>ALL chri&s;tian graces are of immediate u&s;e in the admini&s;tration of government.

Since religion furni&s;hes men with tho&s;e excelling gifts and good di&s;po&s;itions, which qualify them to govern, &s;o they can never cultivate faith and piety with too care|ful an a&s;&s;iduity. Their &s;ucce&s;s in office, and their u&s;efulne&s;s among their &s;ubjects, depend primarily upon the Divine pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing. There|fore they &s;hould be men of exemplary faith in their King and Saviour, and not lean unto their own under&s;tanding.

that they are made rulers ultimately for the good and pro&s;perity of the Church, we mu&s;t cen|&s;ure tho&s;e for their ignorance or irreligion, who adopt a maxim &s;o pernicious to civil &s;ociety, and embarra&s;&s;ing to the intere&s;ts of virtue and morali|ty. Without religion, rulers have no God, unto whom they may repair and expect his ble&s;&s;ing up|on their admini&s;tration. God is not with them, and when his pre&s;ence is withdrawn, darkne&s;s and perplexity will fill their paths with &s;nares and ad|ver&s;ity. Immoral and ungodly rulers may affect courte&s;y, affability and patrioti&s;m to gain popula|rity; but they have no moral principle upon which the public may depend, and too often have they proved the &s;courge of the community, and the rod of God's indignation again&s;t a profane or hy|pocritical people. Therefore we lay it down as a qualification of great moment to the State, that magi&s;trates be men of piety, who have a govern|ing regard to the glory of God, and a warm affec|tion for the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.

A haughty, unyielding and mur|muring di&s;po&s;ition, is the infamy of &s;ubjects, and will prove their eventual ruin from the ju&s;tice of God, who wills that his ordinances be re&s;pected by men.

THIS country was planted by men of &s;ingular piety, of whom the old world was not worthy. God found them a refuge from the oppre&s;&s;ion of civil and &s;piritual tyranny. Having planted, he protected them from the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing dangers. Often hath he delivered them by &s;igns and wonders, and by an out-&s;tretched arm. In &s;ome feeble mea|&s;ure our Forefathers lived worthy of the Divine care over them, and by grateful obedience ac|knowledged the &s;alvations wrought for them. But their children forgat his benefits, and by ir|religion and &s;en&s;uality, by di&s;&s;ipation and luxury, by worldline&s;s and pride, they provoked the Holy One of I&s;rael, to threaten them with the lo&s;s of tho&s;e privileges and ble&s;&s;ings, which he had &s;o richly be&s;towed, and they had &s;o unthankfully abu&s;ed.</P>

<P>BY the will of God, and the direction of his ordinance, our civil authority, to whom our fir&s;t, allegiance was due, we were called to contend for our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, our liberties and our lives, even unto blood. Long and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing was the conflict. In the confu&s;ions of war, and e&s;pecially in the perplexities of &s;uch a war, in which the minds of the people were divided as to their duties of alle|giance, order and government were e&s;&s;entially injured among&s;t us, and that &s;pirit of &s;ubordi|nation and loyalty, which was before habitual, was nearly lo&s;t, and for a &s;ea&s;on we were threatened with all the mi&s;eries of that people, who have no magi&s;trate to put them in &s;ear.

was his grace more remarkable than in leading us out of a di&s;tempered &s;tate of partial anarchy into a &s;tate of order and government. He gave us laws and te&s;timonies right and good, a civil con&s;titution perhaps the mo&s;t perfect in the world, which is the &s;ecurity of good citizens, the admiration of the wi&s;e, and the envy of tyrants: To which if if we &s;trictly adhere, we cannot in a political &s;en&s;e, fail of being a happy people.</P>
<P>SINCE this mercy of our God upon us, in &s;aving us from the evils of war, and plucking us from the confu&s;ions of anarchy, we have walked un|worthy of his great goodne&s;s. We &s;ang his prai&s;es, but &s;oon forgot his benefits. We have continued to indulge tho&s;e follies and exce&s;&s;es, for which he had already cha&s;tized us. While deeply in|volved in debt, our di&s;tempered pa&s;&s;ion for the fa&s;hions of luxurious and affluent nations, plung|ed us into our former prodigality and unpro|fitable expences. In&s;tead of applying our&s;elves to di&s;charge the claims of public and private cre|ditors, and thus to vindicate our honour and independence, we employed the riches of our &s;oil in purcha&s;ing the trappings of an exotic dre&s;s, and in indulging our vitiated appetites in the expen&s;ive productions of di&s;tant regions, and thus are we become the &s;ervants of foreigners, and &s;trangers

rule over us. Poor and dependent, our minds are enervated to the pur&s;uits of national freedom and dignity. And yet re&s;tle&s;s under the unavoidable pre&s;&s;ure of our follies, we are little inclined to &s;atisfy our creditors, and pay the price of our beloved di&s;&s;ipation. Like the prodigal, exhau&s;ted and worn down by riot, we complain of our pains and em|barra&s;&s;ments, and idly re&s;olve into a grievance, that poverty, from which no created power but our own can &s;ave us. Jaded by our vices, indigent through profu&s;e living, rendered untractable by long exemption from the re&s;traints of human and Divine laws, and proud in a licentious liberty, that fore-runner of de&s;poti&s;m, we have become re&s;tle&s;s under nece&s;&s;ary burdens, and with a mi&s;taken re&s;entment, have complained of public requi&s;itions as the &s;ource of our &s;orrows and perplexities. Lavi&s;h expences have made us poor, and a tem|per not duly &s;ubordinate, has turned our com|plaints from our own follies, again&s;t our Fathers, our be&s;t friends and benefactors. How many of us have laboured to free our&s;elves from the ne|ce&s;&s;ary burdens of public and private debts, that we might obtain a wider &s;cope for the indulgence of appetites, which it were much better to mortify?</P>
<P>WILL the enquiry be thought immode&s;t, when I a&s;k, whether our wealthy and leading characters,
<PB N="43" REF="020469_0043_0FAF0D116D51B710">
have not been fir&s;t in this tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion? Of the legi&s;lators of our republican government, we might have expected effectual laws to di&s;courage exce&s;&s;es, by which the citizens are &s;o certainly de|graded to a &s;tate of &s;ervility and dependence. They knew better than their con&s;tituents, the evil of &s;uch exce&s;&s;es. Might they not in due &s;ea&s;on, have encouraged indu&s;try, temperance and fruga|lity, among the people; laid re&s;trictions upon foreign luxuries, and made it as nece&s;&s;ary as it was u&s;eful, for the people to produce the accommoda|tions of life by their own labour, and upon their own &s;oil. And e&s;pecially might not the exam|ples of men in power, and families of fa&s;hion and affluence, in preferring the productions of our own country, to commodities received from abroad, have produced the mo&s;t &s;alutary effects among all cla&s;&s;es of our citizens? Such examples would have been more influential and authoritative, than a whole code of commercial regulations. This is one of our wounds; I mention it freely, &s;ince I hope in a good Providence, that our rulers, our public teachers and the multitude of our brethren, will think it important to apply them&s;elves to a radi|cal cure of the evil. For nothing kills the noble &s;pirit of freedom, like a &s;tate of dependence, which
<PB N="44" REF="020469_0044_0FAF0D122B9735D0">
will ever attend the folly of &s;pending more than we earn. Let our rulers not merely in word, but in deed, by a laudable example, be fir&s;t in this matter, and teach republicans to be hone&s;t, in|du&s;trious and frugal in their modes of living. Then &s;hall &s;ub&s;tantial wealth and independence be the joyous portion, of all cla&s;&s;es of our happy ci|tizens.</P>

God has &s;uffered a &s;pirit of in&s;urrection and re|&s;i&s;tance of lawful authority to ri&s;e up in this Com|monwealth. As a correction from him, it is a righteous te&s;timony of his holy di&s;plea&s;ure; as proceeding from man, perhaps an oppo&s;ition to government, and a war again&s;t the community, has been &s;eldom more wanton and unprovoked.

The objects &s;ought after, in the&s;e tumults, have been of the mo&s;t faulty kind. One avowed end was to compel the Legi&s;lature, into an emi&s;&s;ion of a paper currency, to be a tender in payment of all public and private contracts. A mea&s;ure wholly prepo&s;terous, when the public ought to be di&s;|charging their old obligations, and not contracting a new debt by borrowing money by an emi&s;&s;ion of paper; a mea&s;ure totally unju&s;t, and as truly impolitic as to admini&s;ter opiates to cure a lethar|gy. The faultine&s;s of &s;uch violent attempts aro&s;e al&s;o from the utter impo&s;&s;ibility in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our affairs, that the Legi&s;lature could make a promi&s;e upon their paper and keep it; that is, they could never hone&s;tly redeem the money, by &s;aving it from a rapid depreciation, and making punctual payment. Such a mea&s;ure then, would have been a gro&s;s violation of commuta|tive ju&s;tice, the unwavering ob&s;ervance of which, is enjoined upon all bodies of men under all po&s;&s;i|ble circum&s;tances. To endeavour by ho&s;tility to compel the Legi&s;lature into a mea&s;ure, which they wi&s;ely thought impolitic, and knew to be palpably unju&s;t, was an high handed offence, and clearly proves, that multitudes were under the clouds of God's anger, and were &s;adly for&s;aken of re&s;train|ing grace.</P>

BUT the de&s;ign was filled with other mi&s;chiefs. It was to wre&s;t from the Legi&s;lature the power of governing; from the tribunals of law the power of decreeing ju&s;tice; and from the Executive, the e&s;&s;ential prerogative of carrying into effect the laws of the Commonwealth. Thus were our foundations to have been de&s;troyed. The declar|ed intentions of the male-contents, and what they attempted by levying an impious war upon their country, was to arre&s;t the arm of government, and &s;eize the admini&s;tration of a de&s;potic rule into their own hands; to &s;ap the foundations of our glori|ous con&s;titution, to change its e&s;&s;ential forms, and thus to break down the barriers of our rights, and overwhelm this great republic in dreary confu&s;ion and irretrievable ruin. Whoever has been ac|quainted with their complaints and their claims, and has been the witne&s;s of their proceedings, will con&s;ider this, as a charitable repre&s;entation of their views and pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>BLESSED be the Lord God of our &s;alvation, that in the mid&s;t of our unworthine&s;s and provoca|tions, he has interpo&s;ed and &s;aved us from the &s;word of the oppre&s;&s;or, and the violence of wicked men. Ardent thank&s;givings are this day due to

the Father of mercies, That in the &s;ea&s;on of alarm|ing dangers, he rai&s;ed up an admini&s;tration of go|vernment, who, in the faithful page of hi&s;tory, will be celebrated for their wi&s;dom, their modera|tion and integrity.</P>
<P>AFTER many outrageous and trea&s;onable ex|ce&s;&s;es, had prevailed, in &s;everal parts of the State, and the lives and e&s;tates of their guilty authors were forfeited to their country, our Chief Magi&s;trate, at the reque&s;t of the Legi&s;lature, offered a free and full pardon to all the promoters and abettors of tho&s;e &s;editious tumults. Through an infatuated obduracy, that pardon was &s;cornfully rejected, even under the cleare&s;t light and evidence exhibited to them, that their complaints were groundle&s;s, and that the government had been admini&s;tered with great integrity. Former violences were renewed, the criminal demands of the in&s;urgents increa&s;ed, and the exi&s;tence of the Commonwealth, was put to the hazard. When unmixed mercy could not reclaim but rai&s;ed to higher exce&s;&s;es the re&s;i&s;tance of the offenders, authority a&s;&s;umed a more firm and deci&s;ive tone, and rai&s;ed a military force to repel their violence. Yet great was the forbearance and compa&s;&s;ion of government in all their exertions to &s;uppre&s;s the rebellion. Forgivene&s;s was &s;till ex|tended

to the body of the rebels, the leaders only were left to the ju&s;tice of the law, and even with the leaders much lenity was u&s;ed by proffering terms of pardon to many of them. The &s;teps of our civil admini&s;tration were the marks of their ju&s;tice and humanity. The wi&s;dom and deci&s;ion of the Council, demand our admiration and grati|tude: the mea&s;ures of our Chief Magi&s;trate all de|noted the firmne&s;s of his &s;pirit, his regard for our laws, his inflexible adherence to the principles of the con&s;titution, and his un&s;haken determination to protect his country, and repre&s;s the violence of wicked men. His conduct was equally di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for benignity and moderation, that aver|&s;ion from blood&s;hed and that ardent wi&s;h to reco|ver and pre&s;erve offenders, which is a &s;hining part of the character of a good man and a chri&s;tian ma|gi&s;trate.

<P>MAY the author of all effectual influences impre&s;s the minds of deluded citizens with a conviction of the criminality of their conduct, and of the evident hand of God, which was lifted up again&s;t them. It is but ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve, that the mea&s;ures of government, have been conformable to the &s;y&s;tem of God's government over a &s;inful world.

<P>WITH plea&s;ing anticipation, we behold your Excellency God's mini&s;ter for good, bearing the &s;word of the State, not as a terror to good works, but to the evil. Our eye with delight marks your path, while you lead us your children into the duties of relative and Chri&s;tian life, and by your example teach us, that &s;elf-denial, frugality and indu&s;try, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the happine&s;s of a free people. From your Excellency, will our Legi&s;lature expect advice in tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which may main|tain inviolate the principles of our civil con&s;titution again&s;t every &s;pecies of encroachment; how the public good is to be pur&s;ued, hone&s;ty and integrity, diligence and application encouraged, and di&s;&s;i|pation driven from the State; how the laws of ju&s;tice may be effectually vindicated, and the &s;eat of fraud and oppre&s;&s;ion, be removed far from us. Our expectations are from your Excellency, That liberty &s;hall be maintained by law, and all &s;ubjects be &s;ecure in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; that public faith, and national credit and dignity, be &s;ollicitou&s;ly pre&s;erved.</P>

OUR re&s;pects are now due to the Gentlemen who compo&s;e the Honourable the Senate, and the Honourable the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P><HI>Fathers of our country, and Elders of our tribes,</HI></P>
<P>YOU are this day con&s;tituted by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the ordinance of God, for the good of his church, and the welfare of this Commonwealth. The oath of God is upon you, to maintain the laws of the State, and the &s;acred principles of our excellent con&s;titu|tion: A con&s;titution which wi&s;dom will approve, as the national bulwark of our independence and &s;o|vereignty, the effectual protection of good citizens, the &s;ecurity of freedom, property and life, and our defence again&s;t the rude encroachments of anarchy and de&s;poti&s;m. You have this day declared your belief of the Chri&s;tian religion. Integrity in this profe&s;&s;ion will lead you to prize our con&s;titution the more, &s;ince it is &s;o friendly to morality, and the Chri&s;tian faith. You have bound your&s;elves in the di&s;charge of your office, to promote the common good upon go&s;pel principles; by cultivat|ing in your temper, and practice, tho&s;e benevolent graces of Chri&s;tianity, which will enable you to rule with reputation to your&s;elves, and advantage to the people. You have pledged your&s;elves to honor Chri&s;t's in&s;titutions, to protect his &s;ervants, to di&s;countenance all contempt of the doctrines
<PB N="56" REF="020469_0056_0FAF0D1CCF8C9358">
and maxims of his holy faith. Thus from the manner of your inauguration, we may expect, that you be nur&s;ing Fathers to the Church. It becomes a mini&s;ter of that Church, (and will there|fore be acceptable to you) to &s;tir up your pure minds to u&s;e the gift that is in you, for the good of the people. You are the Mini&s;ters of God, and as &s;uch, accountable at the tribunal of the Son of Man, in the great day of dread deci&s;ion. Let me exhort you as candidates for eternity, to keep in mind that &s;olemn day, and as faithful &s;ervants, to be habitually prepared for it. And that through Divine grace, you may give up a good account at la&s;t, be entreated to regard the eye of God, which is upon you, and look to him to pardon your un|worthine&s;s, to coun&s;el you by his unerring wi&s;dom, and to quicken you by his truth: That he would not take his Holy Spirit from you, but by his effectual influences, guide you into the paths of uprightne&s;s. The &s;criptures will teach you your liablene&s;s to err; and your de&s;ire to be u&s;eful, will excite your applications for that anointing of the Holy One, by which you will not err fatally. As Rulers, it concerns you to be men of prayer, to maintain an intercour&s;e with Heaven, and an humble dependance upon Divine teaching and guidance. Do you wi&s;h to be honoured of God in your office? You mu&s;t honour him by &s;ubmit|ing

your admini&s;trations to his government, by a re&s;pect to his name, his in&s;titutions and tho&s;e eternal laws of righteou&s;ne&s;s, ordained for the careful ob&s;ervance of all his rational &s;ubjects. With you <HI>the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wi&s;dom, and to depart from evil is under&s;tanding.</HI>&mdash;To you as their Fathers, will the people look for patterns of moral and Chri&s;tian duty. You will therefore go before them in per&s;onal, in family and public religion and obedience. Care for the State will arm your zeal and fortitude again&s;t vicious and immoral practices, to frown upon gro&s;s breaches of human and Divine laws. Your &s;ervices will be approved of God, and u&s;eful to the community, whenever you &s;hall puni&s;h with deci&s;ion and impartiality, the lawle&s;s practices of vicious and di&s;obedient &s;ubjects. Through your example and official exertions &s;hall tho&s;e virtues of benevolence, integrity, indu&s;try and frugality, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to a republican and Chri&s;tian community, greatly prevail. And your te&s;timony &s;hall &s;uppre&s;s the in&s;olence of fraud and inju&s;tice, fal&s;hood and perjury, by which the bonds of &s;ociety are di&s;&s;olved. May the oath of God become terrible, and all human promi&s;es and con|tracts be held &s;acred. Punctuality in Rulers to their contracts, is the fir&s;t &s;tep towards a general

hone&s;ty in the State. Their example gives energy to laws again&s;t private fraud and inju&s;tice. You will feel the bond of that law of your Ma&s;ter, <HI>to owe no man any thing;</HI> but according to the ability of the people, to make a punctual and &s;atisfactory payment of public debts. You will utterly di&s;|allow all mea&s;ures, which may put hone&s;t and feeble citizens into the power of griping and un|principled oppre&s;&s;ors; than &s;uch mea&s;ures, nothing is more repugnant to that Go&s;pel, by which you are to be judged. Every indirect method to ex|tricate the people from embarra&s;&s;ments, is a new load to &s;ink them in the mire. The Fathers of our tribes will therefore cultivate public and pri|vate faith, and learn us all <HI>not to go beyond, or to defraud our neighbour.</HI></P>
<P>MAY the good God influence our honourable Legi&s;lature, into a &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration, which &s;hall defend our Con&s;titution, render venerable our laws, protect from violence the &s;eats of Ju&s;tice and the Throne of Judgement, and by a due mixture of mercy and ju&s;tice, allure offenders to obedience, or by adequate penalties incapaciate them from di&s;turbing the public tranquility. You will think nothing too much to encourage a &s;pirit of loyalty and patrioti&s;m; and to this end you will
<PB N="59" REF="020469_0059_0FAF0D20AD0D91C0">
encourage the means of grace and education. To your wi&s;dom does it belong to di&s;cover the political mea&s;ures, for promoting the good de&s;igns which have been mentioned, but I may &s;ugge&s;t, that they &s;hould be &s;uch as are approved by the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>OUR national concerns, as a confederated Republic, are &s;erious concerns. Your deliberate coun&s;els will be requi&s;ite to invent &s;ome remedy for our national imbecility and reproach. Unle&s;s effectual and liberal mea&s;ures are &s;oon taken, our glory and independence will vani&s;h into air. Be intreated Fathers, to lay a&s;ide limited views and local prejudices, and to encompa&s;s the Union in the exertions of your wi&s;dom and patrioti&s;m.</P>

which is ju&s;t, who love the people, and will by per&s;onal labours and &s;elf-denial, and unwearied diligence, pur&s;ue their &s;olid and la&s;ting advantages, and yet di&s;dain by meanne&s;s and artifice, and by &s;acrificing their own judgement, to gain an empty popular applau&s;e.</P>
<P>A LEGISLATURE thus con&s;tituted, and what a re&s;pectable number of &s;uch amiable and worthy characters do I now behold; &s;uch a Legi&s;lature, &s;hall in the i&s;&s;ue enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of their country, while time &s;erving politicians, &s;hall &s;ink in the dirt of their de&s;erved ignominy: Such a Legi&s;lature may hope to have God with them, to pro&s;per the work of their hands. From the faithful di&s;charge of an earthly tru&s;t, they &s;hall in their time and order, be received to the plaudit of their final Judge. Such is the reward which we pray that every member of our public admini&s;tration, in the Executive, Legi&s;lative and Judicial department, may now de&s;erve, and in future obtain from the mouth of him, who &s;iteth upon the Throne.</P>
<P>MAY we all repent, and do our fir&s;t works, that God may be in the mid&s;t of us. That he may &s;it in the a&s;&s;embly of our Rulers, is the devout &s;upplication of all, who hope in his mercy, and wi&s;h well to this Commonwealth.</P>
