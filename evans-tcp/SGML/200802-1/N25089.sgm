<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>UPON examining the records of medicine, from the earlie&s;t periods, it appears that phy|&s;icians have never con&s;idered the living body as &s;ubject, like all other parts of the univer&s;e, to regular and immutable laws; but &s;eem actually to have drawn an oppo&s;ite conclu&s;ion. It is from this circum&s;tance principally, that the practice of medicine has hitherto acquired &s;o &s;mall a portion of certainty, as &s;till to merit the appellation be&s;towed upon it, more than two thou&s;and years ago, of a "conjectural art."</P>
<P>THE various doctrines which have been pub|li&s;hed to the world, regarding the human body, are in general, nothing more than a mere a&s;|&s;emblage of words, without the power of con|veying any di&s;tinct ideas. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As truth is but one, and the hypothe&s;is, which may be formed upon any given &s;ubject, infinite; &s;o the chance of any hypothe&s;is being true, is as one is to an infinite number; or the certainty of its being erroneous, ab&s;olute. Every ju&s;t deduction of rea&s;oning, is properly called theory. But the&s;e terms are, to the great detriment of &s;cience, very generally confounded.</NOTE>Hypothe&s;is has &s;uc|ceeded
<PB N="18" REF="033254_0010_0ff6a76840cffe18">
hypothe&s;is, in the &s;ame regular manner, that phy&s;ician has &s;ucceeded phy&s;ician. Opi|nions have been adopted, according to the chances of education; &s;upported by the au|thority of great names; and religiou&s;ly adhered to, as fundamental axioms, into the truth of which it would have been here&s;y to enquire.</P>
<P>THE mi&s;chiefs ari&s;ing from this &s;ource,
<Q>greatly extend their influence, and &s;pread in every po&s;&s;ible direction, when error acquires the patronage of authority, and the protection of dignified names. It then takes its chair in the &s;chools, and a&s;&s;umes the pompous titles of profound, refined, or liberal know|ledge. Rai&s;ed to this eminence, the indu&s;|try of a &s;ingle teacher, or author, may cor|rupt thou&s;ands; that of a few, whole na|tions; and the addition of a proportional number, ruin the education of a world.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THIS univer&s;al diffu&s;ion of error, receives &s;anction and e&s;tabli&s;hment from the progre&s;s of time. It becomes venerable: and every attempt to detect it, is branded with the name of profanity or madne&s;s.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Introduction to the Outlines, &amp;c. by John Brown, p. ii.</NOTE> Such has, un|happily, been too long the &s;tate of &s;cience.
<PB N="19" REF="033254_0011_0ff6a76a9f90b810">
But, of late years, every department of human knowledge has undergone a rapid improvement. The dawn of rea&s;on has, in a particular degree, begun to enlighten the medical world; and the practice to a&s;&s;ume a con&s;i&s;tency, which could only be founded on the di&s;covery of the laws, by which all living bodies are governed.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;covery, one of the grande&s;t efforts of the human mind, that ever dignified the page of &s;cience, the di&s;coveries of the immortal Newton him&s;elf not excepted, is contained in the Elements of Medicine, of the late celebrated John Brown. This di&s;covery, hitherto neg|lected from ignorance, oppo&s;ed from the &s;hame of recantation, and calumniated from intere&s;t, prejudice, and pa&s;&s;ion, contains &s;o many unde|niable truths that, to an unbia&s;&s;ed mind, it only requires to be known, in order to be admired and adopted. The doctrine, although it has not yet been &s;anctioned by the medical &s;chools of Britain, has, however&punc; been very generally re|ceived, in the other &s;chools of Europe, and in America. "In the Univer&s;ity of Pavia," &s;ays Dr. Ra&s;ori,
<Q>undoubtedly one of the fir&s;t in Europe, there is hardly a &s;tudent endowed with talents, who is not a Brunonian. The doctrine begins equally to &s;pread in Ger|many. Many of the periodical publications of that country have noticed it, and the Ele|menta
<PB N="20" REF="033254_0012_0ff6a76d9eadbab0" MS="y">
have lately been publi&s;hed there. A friend at Genoa a&s;&s;ures me, that &s;everal &s;ur|geons to French men of war have informed him, that Brown is known and much admired in France. In the Univer&s;ity of Pavia, Brown is in high e&s;teem, even with &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable profe&s;&s;ors; and in other parts of Italy, I can a&s;&s;ert, from my own knowledge, that old phy&s;icians have not refu&s;|ed their &s;anction to many of the Brunonian principles.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Beddoes' Life of Brown.</NOTE></P>
<P>ONE of his Italian critics, &s;uppo&s;ed to be Profe&s;&s;or Carminati, &s;ays,
<Q>Quaerenti mihi cau&s;as incredibilis prope illius commotionis ani|morum, atque ingentis fer&eacute; plau&s;us, quibus nuperim&egrave; &s;ingularis illa hypothe&s;is, cui novum Univer&s;ae Medicinae Sy&s;tema celebri&s;mus An|gliae Scriptor et Medicus BRUNO &s;uper&s;truxit, ab iis optimae &s;pei adole&s;centibus excepta e&s;&s;et, qui in florenti&s;&s;imo Ticinen&s;i Archigymna&s;io &s;a|lutaris artis &s;tudiis omnibus mecum incumbunt, peraduum &s;ane, non fuit eas **** invenire.</Q></P>
<P>MANY tran&s;lations and editions of this work, and various critici&s;ms upon it, have appeared in different parts of Europe, which it is by no means nece&s;&s;ary to enumerate here. That
<PB N="21" REF="033254_0013_0ff6a717a1534fa0">
the knowledge of it has al&s;o made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s, among the medical philo&s;ophers of America, is evident, from the frequent allu&s;ions made to it, in a late publication, by Dr. Ru&s;h, of Philadelphia.
<Q>The principle of the gradu|al application of &s;timuli to the body, in all the di&s;ea&s;es of indirect debility on the one hand, and of direct on the other, opens a wide field for the improvement of medicine. Perhaps all the di&s;coveries of future ages, will con&s;i&s;t more in a new application of e&s;tabli&s;h|ed principle, and in new modes of exhibiting old medicine, than in the di&s;coveries of new theories, or of new articles of the Materia Medica.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> "An Account of the bilious remitting yellow Fe|ver,"&mdash;<HI>page 284.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>ANOTHER proof of the excellence of the doc|trine, no le&s;s convincing, is deducible from the frequent plagiari&s;ms of its fundamental princi|ples, by which &s;ome men, de&s;irous of pa&s;&s;ing them upon the world as their own di&s;coveries, have lately endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h a reputation for &s;uperior genius. Any attempt to detect the&s;e, in their various and mo&s;t infinite ramifi|cations, would, as Dr. Beddoes <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It would be inju&s;tice, upon this occa&s;ion, to pa&s;s over, without a tribute of applau&s;e, the laudable exertions of Dr. Beddoes, in promulgating the knowledge of Brown's doctrine, He is perhaps the only author in Britain, who has dared pub|lickly to a&s;&s;ert the merits of it. This ingenious conduct, and the liberal manner in which he &s;tepped forward, to benefit the unfortunate family of our illu&s;trious philo&s;opher,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide a new edition of the Elements of Medicine, of John Brown, M. D. with a biographical Preface by Thomas Bed|does, M. D.</NOTE> equally evince his &s;uperior mind, and univer&s;al philanthropy.</NOTE> very ju&s;tly re|marks,
<PB N="22" REF="033254_0014_0ff6a719d5b53870">
be now unnece&s;&s;ary. Among the mo&s;t con&s;picuous, however, in this li&s;t, we may par|ticulari&s;e Doctor Gritanner.&mdash;There is not a &s;ingle idea in any of the papers, which he has publi&s;hed upon that &s;ubject, that is not borrow|ed from the Doctrine of Brown, or the different modifications of it, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the Medical So|ciety of Edinburgh, and recorded upon its books. The&s;e he has freely u&s;ed, without the &s;malle&s;t acknowledgment. His doctrine, of the principle of irritability, is taken from a paper, written by a re&s;pectable member of that Society.</P>
<P>DR. G. was a &s;tudent at Edinburgh, long af|ter the publication of the <HI>Elementa Medicinae;</HI> and at a time, when the principles of the doc|trine, were the &s;ubject of inve&s;tigation, in the literary &s;ocieties of that Univer&s;ity. His plagia|ri&s;ms mu&s;t therefore have been wilful; and no acknowledgment, &s;ub&s;equent to detection, can
<PB N="23" REF="033254_0015_0ff6a71ce8f22d80" MS="y">
be con&s;idered as an atonement. There is &s;ome|thing &s;o flagitious in the attempt to rob departed genius of its honours&mdash;honours too, in the ac|qui&s;ition of which friend&s;hips, emolument, and ea&s;e, were all &s;acrificed,&mdash;that it cannot be too &s;everely reprobated.</P>
<P>IT is a common and often a true ob&s;ervation, that "no man is a prophet in his own country." Accordingly, it appears, that this doctrine was longer neglected, and is &s;till more anxiou&s;ly op|po&s;ed in Britain, than in other nations. Few men at an advanced period of life, have &s;ufficient courage to relinqui&s;h &s;entiments to which they have been habituated, from their early years; fewer &s;till have candour enough to acknowledge the truth of what they have &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed; and young men, although generally open to con|viction, &s;eldom have &s;ufficient confidence in them|&s;elves, to &s;tem the torrent of general opinion. The ri&s;ing generation, however, in order to adopt the new doctrine, will not have many &s;acrifices to make. It will neither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffect their intere&s;t, nor wound their vanity.</P>
<P>THAT the force of truth already begins to &s;i|lence the unmeaning clamour, which has hither|to been made again&s;t this doctrine in Baitain, is evinced, by the reception of a late volumi|nous publication, of which the chief merit con|&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="24" REF="033254_0016_0ff769a76c45f048" MS="y">
in, an occa&s;ional and imperfect coincidence with the principles of Brown. It will readily be perceived, that we allude to the Zoonomia of Dr. Darwin,&mdash;a work which, from the excel|lent character and reputed talents of its author, had rai&s;ed con&s;iderable expectation in the public mind. But di&s;appointment, on the peru&s;al, was in proportion to the previous expectation. In|&s;tead of important and luminous corrections of the doctrine, which might have been looked for, at this time of day, from a man of abili|ties, pur&s;uing the &s;ame track of inve&s;tigation, a want of argument and correct rea&s;oning, is found to pervade the whole. It is &s;uch a <HI>rudis indige&s;ta|que molis</HI> that, after wading through nearly &s;ix hundred pages,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the time this was written, the fir&s;t volume only, of Darwin's Zoonomia, appeared in India.</NOTE> it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to compre|hend the &s;cientific principles, upon which the author intended to build his doctrine. From the&s;e &s;trictures, it ought not to be inferred, that we wi&s;h to detract from the merits of the excel|lent poet, who has &s;o elegantly &s;ung the "Loves of the Plants." But ju&s;tice forbids that, out of re&s;pect to character or reputation, one man &s;hould be allowed to a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf, any por|tion of that honour, which exclu&s;ively belongs to another. Science knows no per&s;onal di&s;tinc|tions.

The author of a grand di&s;covery, is, at lea&s;t, entitled to po&s;thumous fame.</P>
<P>THE ORIGIN of this, like every other di&s;covery of importance, has been attempted to be traced to hints thrown out by preceding authors. E|ven the vi&s;ionary &s;peculations of Cullen, have been mentioned, as the &s;ource, of &s;ome of its fundamental principles:&mdash;with ju&s;t as much pro|priety might they he imputed to any ingenious &s;ugge&s;tion in "The life and Opinions of Tri&s;|tram Shandy." Upon the whole, it may with confidence be a&s;&s;erted, that this doctrine is, in all its parts, original, as it is undoubtedly true, and important in its application. And tho&s;e, who are di&s;po&s;ed to deny it this merit, &s;hould, in decency, adduce &s;omething like argu|ment, in&s;tead of the ebullitions of vanity, de|traction, or jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>AFTER this eulogy, the reader may perhaps expect, that the following pages contain a mere verbal copy of Brown's <HI>Elements of Medicine</HI>; but he will &s;oon perceive, that this is not the ca&s;e. For, although its fundamental principles are in|di&s;putably true, there are &s;everal errors in the detail, and &s;ome of them of very con&s;iderable importance. His opponents, however, if truth had been their object, &s;hould have endeavoured to perfect the doctrine, by a correction of its errors, in&s;tead of illiberally affecting, on ac|count
<PB N="26" REF="033254_0018_0ff7699e3166f130">
of partial blemi&s;hes, to reject the whole. To the candid, liberal, and enlightened, it will appear much le&s;s wonderful, that Brown &s;hould have &s;ome times erred, than that he &s;hould have been &s;o pre-eminently &s;ucce&s;sful, in fir&s;t pointing out, to the world, the right path of medical in|ve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>THE principal deviations, from the original doctrine, to be found in the following
<Q>View of the Science of Life,</Q>
are the&s;e:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t.&mdash;It is demon&s;trated, that di&s;ea&s;es of exce&s;|&s;ive excitement cannot exi&s;t; and that all tho&s;e, which have been &s;o called, are di&s;ea&s;es of in|direct debility.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2dly.&mdash;ALMOST the whole of the di&s;ea&s;es, which were ranked, by Brown, and his follow|ers, among the di&s;ea&s;es of direct debility, are &s;hewn to be di&s;ea&s;es of indirect debility.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3dly.&mdash;IN the mode of applying the exciting powers, for the cure of di&s;ea&s;es of indirect debi|debility.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>FROM this &s;tatement, it appears, that the al|terations, here made in the doctrine, as they affect the method of cure, in more than one half of the di&s;ea&s;es, to which living bodies are &s;ubject, are of the fir&s;t importance; and there|fore de&s;erve a candid examination.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="033254_0019_0ff769ad0fbca7f0">IT may be proper to remark, that &s;ome per|&s;ons have affected to reject this doctrine, upon the very grave and &s;olemn ground, of its being favourable to intemperance. To tho&s;e however, who will take the trouble of making them&s;elves acquainted with its principles, it will only be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that &s;uch per&s;ons do not under&s;tand the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>IN climates and countries where the tran&s;ition, from health to di&s;ea&s;e, and from di&s;ea&s;e to death, is often alarmingly rapid, and health always pre|carious, the knowledge of a doctrine, which re|duces the practice of medicine to a degree of cer|tainty hitherto unknown, cannot but be attend|ed with great and evident advantages. To dif|fu&s;e that knowledge in India, where the doctrine &s;eems to have been but little cultivated, and &s;o have acquired but a &s;mall degree of reputation &s;o ju&s;tly due to it, is the de&s;ign of this undertak|ing. The attempt is made with the greater con|fidence, from having experienced, in the appli|cation of the principles to practice, a degree of &s;ucce&s;s, far beyond even the mo&s;t &s;anguine expec|tations, that had previou&s;ly been formed in theory. If, however, this confidence &s;hould not, after a fair inve&s;tigation, be ju&s;tified by the experience of others, the &s;ubject remains open for free di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="28" REF="033254_0020_0ff769ae919436b0">
by which alone the doctrine mu&s;t, final|ly, be either confirmed, or refuted.</P>
<P>AS it is, for obvious rea&s;ons, de&s;ireable, that a knowledge of medical &s;cience, &s;hould not be ex|clu&s;ively confined to medical men, we have en|tirely dive&s;ted our ob&s;ervations of the my&s;terious garb, in which &s;uch knowledge is u&s;ually con|veyed to the world.</P>

<P N="13">XIII. As the body becomes &s;u&s;ceptible of im|pre&s;&s;ion, in the direct ratio of &s;ubduction of &s;ti|muli (v. 1.), it follows that the force of &s;timu|lus to be applied, in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, of this &s;tate, &s;hould be inver&s;ely as the accumulation of the excitability. Thus in the ca&s;e of per&s;ons who have been expo&s;ed to great degrees of cold, heat &s;hould be applied, fir&s;t in a degree not much greater than the lowe&s;t temperature, to which the per&s;on has been expo&s;ed, and gradually increa&s;ed to the u&s;ual &s;tandard. To frozen limbs, the

fir&s;t application &s;hould be &s;now, then cold wa|ter, afterwards water le&s;s cold, and &s;o on, through the various degrees, until motion and &s;en&s;ation are fully re&s;tored. Whereas, by the immediate application of the accu&s;tomed degree of heat, death would be produced in the whole, or tho&s;e parts of the body, which had been expo&s;ed.&mdash; To per&s;ons who may have remained long without food, nouri&s;hment &s;hould be exhibited in the &s;ame gradual manner. The quantity u&s;ually ta|ken at a meal would, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, in&s;tantly extingui&s;h life,&mdash; a fact of which there are many in&s;tances upon record. The eyes of per&s;ons, who have been long kept in darkne&s;s, become exceedingly &s;en&s;ible to the &s;malle&s;t degree of light. Tho&s;e unfortunate beings, whom the mi&s;|taken and perver&s;e policy of man has doomed to long confinement in dungeons, become, in the cour&s;e of time, capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing all the corners of their gloomy abode; where, upon their fir&s;t entrance, they could di&s;tingui&s;h nothing. The impre&s;&s;ion of the full glare of a meridian light, upon organs in &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;u&s;ceptibility, would occa&s;ion in&s;tant and irreco|verable blindne&s;s. A per&s;on, &s;uddenly awoke in the night, can &s;carcely bear even the &s;mall de|gree of light, emitted from a common candle. It is only by the gradual approach of day, that the eye is enabled to bear the full force of the mid-day &s;un.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="033254_0027_0ff6a78d8e8b1948">SCURVY &s;eems to be a di&s;ea&s;e of direct debili|ty, occa&s;ioned by the ab&s;ence of &s;ome of the u&s;ual exciting powers, particularly nutritive food, heat, and the mental &s;timuli. The&s;e powers mu&s;t be gradually applied, in order to re-produce health. Upon this principle it is, that vegitables and vegi|table acids, as being le&s;s &s;timulant than fre&s;h ani|mal food, are found &s;o u&s;eful in the cure of &s;curvy. An immediate indulgence in the latter, after a long ab&s;tinence, would produce dangerous con&s;equen|ces. In advanced &s;tages of this di&s;ea&s;e, a very &s;mall quantity of &s;timulus, &s;uch as a gla&s;s of ardent &s;pi|rits, or a &s;trong mental impul&s;e, has been frequent|ly known to extingui&s;h life. That diminution of heat has a &s;hare in the production of &s;curvy, is evi|dent from its more frequent occurrence in cold, than in hot climates. And that the ab&s;ence of the mental &s;timuli, is often a &s;ource of this di&s;ea&s;e, is obvious from this,&mdash;that every circum&s;tance that can occur, during a long voyage, calculated to rou&s;e the mind to moderate exertion, will pro|duce an alleviation of the &s;ymptoms;&mdash;the &s;ight of an enemy&mdash;the &s;ight of land&mdash;approach to the de|&s;tined port&mdash;the anticipation of the plea&s;ures of the &s;hore, &amp;c.

po&s;&s;ible &s;ituation. The di&s;ea&s;e in this ca&s;e affects the men, more than the women and children. The rea&s;on is evident. With men, the tran&s;iti|on from liberty to &s;lavery, is greater than with women and children, accu&s;tomed, in their mo&s;t free &s;tate, to look up to them as their &s;uperiors.

<P N="16">XVI.&mdash;AS the body becomes le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of impre&s;&s;ion, in the direct ratio of the exce&s;&s;ive application of &s;timuli (v. iii), it follows that the force of &s;timulus to be applied, in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es of this &s;tate, &s;hould be directly as the exhau&s;tion of the excitability.</P>
<P N="17">XVII.&mdash;AS all di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;e, either from accu|mulation or exhau&s;tion of the excitability, (vi.) and as the di&s;ea&s;es of accumulation have been &s;hewn to be extremely few (xiv), di&s;ea&s;es of in|direct will probably be to tho&s;e of direct debility, in &s;ome &s;uch proportion, as nine hundred and ninety nine to one. The di&s;ea&s;es of warm cli|mates may be con&s;idered, without exception, as di&s;ea&s;es of exhau&s;tion, or of indirect debility.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII.&mdash;AS the highe&s;t excitement is the greate&s;t degree of health, it is evident that, in di&s;ea&s;e, health is to be reproduced, by the ap|plication of &s;uch a degree of &s;timulant power, as is calculated to &s;upport the highe&s;t &s;tate of ex|citement, of which the body, at the time, is
<PB N="38" REF="033254_0030_0ff6a7964ad91980">
capable. Let the middle &s;tate of the excitability for in&s;tance, be repre&s;ented by 20, and the appro|priate degree of &s;timulus, producing healthy ex|citement, by 20 al&s;o (vide Table); let the dimi|ni&s;hing or increa&s;ing &s;um of &s;timulus, in propor|tion to the accumulation or exhau&s;tion of the ex|citability, be repre&s;ented by numbers, as in the annexed table. If the excitability is exhau&s;ted to 10, the &s;um of &s;timulus to be applied, in or|der to produce the greate&s;t excitement, which the &s;tate of the body will allow, will be as 30. Every degree of &s;timulus, beyond that, will exhau&s;t the body &s;till farther, and every degree, below it, will retard the cure. Thus 35 degrees of &s;timu|lus will be too much, 25 too little.</P>
<P N="19">XIX.&mdash;AS the production of the healthy &s;tate is always gradual and progre&s;&s;ive, and is effected by the powers of life; it follows that, in proportion to the degree, in which the&s;e powers can be maintained, the cure will be accelerated. There is no other mode of &s;upporting them, but by an application of &s;timuli, proportionate to the &s;u&s;ceptibility of impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="20">XX.&mdash;AS the &s;um of the powers, producing di&s;ea&s;e, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be a&s;certained, the degree of &s;timulus to be applied, for the reproduction of health, mu&s;t be entirely regulated by ob&s;ervation

<P N="22">XXII.&mdash;THIS variety is of very great extent. The u&s;ual mode, therefore, of pre&s;cribing certain fixed do&s;es of medicines, in every di&s;ea&s;e, what|ever may be the degree of it, is and mu&s;t be nugatory and inefficacious; excepting when the&s;e do&s;es happen, by mere chance, to corre&s;pond with the &s;tate of excitability.&mdash;In a&s;certaining the&s;e degrees, and proportioning the &s;timuli, con&s;i&s;t the judgment of the phy&s;ician.</P>

<P N="24">XXIV.&mdash;THE do&s;es &s;hould be repeated in &s;uch a manner, as to maintain the highe&s;t degree of excitement, of which the body, at the time is capable. But in proportion as the excitability accumulates, or the body approaches to the &s;tate of health, the do&s;es &s;hould be gradually and pro|portionally dimini&s;hed, until at length, health being e&s;tabli&s;hed, nothing more than the action of the ordinary exciting powers is required.</P>
<P N="25">XXV.&mdash;ALL the di&s;ea&s;es enumerated by Brown, as di&s;ea&s;es of accumulation or direct debi|lity, with perhaps the &s;ingle exception of &s;cur|vy, are di&s;ea&s;es of exhau&s;tion. Typhus, Inter|mittents, Dy&s;entery, and &s;ome other di&s;ea&s;es, as they appear to be occa&s;ioned by expo&s;ure to cold, and moi&s;ture, a deficiency of nutriment and of other &s;timuli, have been ranked, by him, in the cla&s;s of di&s;ea&s;es of accumulation. But as the &s;um of the powers, which are concerned in the pro|duction of any particular di&s;ea&s;e, cannot be a&s;cer|tained, the nature of it can only be determined by the effects of the &s;timulant powers, applied for the cure. And, as the cure of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es de|pends upon the application of the mo&s;t powerful &s;timuli, it nece&s;&s;arily follows that, they are di&s;ea&s;|es of indirect debility.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="033254_0033_0ff6a79cae51aa80">THIS error &s;eems to have ari&s;en from an opi|nion, that upon the ab&s;traction of &s;timuli from (or in the the words of Brown, the application of directly debilitating powers to) a body in a &s;tate of exhau&s;tion, the irritability would accu|mulate; or that direct would be &s;uperinduced on indirect debility. But this opinion is evidently erroneous. If from a per&s;on labouring under plague, malagnant fever, or gangrenous &s;ore throat, all the u&s;ual remedies are with-held, and only cold water given, no accumulation of the excitability will take place; but on the contrary, the exhau&s;tion will rapidly proceed, to the ex|tinction of life. If a per&s;on, previou&s;ly exhau&s;|ted by expo&s;ure to exce&s;&s;ive heat, drinks large|ly of, or plunges him&s;elf into cold water, the exhau&s;tion will not be removed; but on the contrary, tho&s;e greater degrees of it produced, con&s;tituting Tetanus, Spa&s;ms of the &s;tomach, &amp;c. And that the&s;e are all di&s;ea&s;es of indirect debility, the mode of cure, which con&s;i&s;ts in the application of a very high degree of &s;timulant power, is a &s;uf|ficient proof. Gout is a familiar in&s;tance in point. The &s;tate of body liable to this di&s;ea&s;e, is produc|ed by a long continued application of food and drink, &s;timulant in too high a degree. Let a gouty per&s;on be expo&s;ed to cold and moi&s;ture, and a paroxy&s;m will readily be produced. Let him &s;uddenly refrain from his u&s;ual quantity of

<P N="29">XXIX.&mdash;AS there are three &s;tates of the excita|bility, (v. 1, 2, 3) &s;o there are three corre&s;pond|ing &s;tates of excitement.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="43" REF="033254_0035_0ff6a7a22134cb20">1&s;t.&mdash;THE &s;tate of dimini&s;hed excitement, from a <HI>deficient</HI> application of &s;timuli, corre&s;|ponding with the &s;tate of accumulation, or di|rect debility.</P>
<P N="2">2dly.&mdash;THE &s;tate of high excitement, from a <HI>due</HI> application of &s;timuli, corre&s;ponding with the middle &s;tate of the excitability or health.</P>
<P N="3">3dly.&mdash;THE &s;tate of dimini&s;hed excitement, from an <HI>exce&s;&s;ive</HI> application of &s;timuli, corre&s;|ponding with the &s;tate of exhau&s;tion, or indi|rect debility.</P>
<P N="30">XXX.&mdash;ALTHOUGH the &s;timulant powers may be applied, in an exce&s;&s;ive degree, to the middle or healthy &s;tate of the excitability, it is evident that excitement never can be exce&s;&s;ive; for eve|ry degree of &s;timulant power, greater than is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to produce health, mu&s;t occa&s;ion a de|gree of exhau&s;tion proportionate to the exce&s;s, (v. 3); and every degree of &s;timulant power, le&s;s than is nece&s;&s;ary to produce health, mu&s;t oc|ca&s;ion a degree of accumulation, proportionate to the deficiency. (v. 1.)</P>
<P N="31">XXXI.&mdash;THERE are, therefore, no di&s;ea&s;es of exce&s;&s;ive excitement. From whence it follows that tho&s;e, which have been &s;o denominated by Brown, mu&s;t be di&s;ea&s;es, either of direct, or indirect debelity (vi.)</P>
<P N="32"><PB N="44" REF="033254_0036_0ff6a7a4f9996450">XXXII.&mdash;THAT they are all di&s;ea&s;es of indi|rect debility, &s;eldom con&s;tituting a very high de|gree of exhau&s;tion, is proved, both by the pow|ers that are known to induce them, and the remedies that are found mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in their cure.</P>
<P>CATARRH, pneumonia, acute rheumati&s;m, and other di&s;ea&s;es of this cla&s;s, are occa&s;ioned by the application of a con&s;iderable degree of heat, after the body has been previou&s;ly expo&s;ed to cold;&mdash;or <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> The temperature of warm rooms is, in general, greater than is &s;ufficient to &s;upport healthy excitement. If the body there|fore has been previou&s;ly expo&s;ed to a con&s;idera|ble degree of cold, the irritability mu&s;t be accu|mulated (v. 1); and the application of a high degree of heat, to a body in that &s;tate, mu&s;t in|evitably produce exhau&s;tion.</P>
<P>IF, on the contrary, a per&s;on has been previ|ou&s;ly expo&s;ed to a degree of heat, beyond what is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport healthy excitement, and cold be &s;uddenly applied, the &s;ame effects will be produced (xxv.)&mdash;In mo&s;t of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, a lo|cal affection takes place, which evidently ari&s;es, from &s;ome parts being more expo&s;ed to the exci|ting powers, than other parts of the body;&mdash;as the mucous membrane of the no&s;e and fauces, in
<PB N="45" REF="033254_0037_0ff6a7a9f42dbe08">
catarrh; the bronchioe and lungs, in pneumonia; and the extremities, in rheumati&s;m. The mode in which the cure of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es is effected, viz. by warmth, &s;mall quantities of opium, wine, &amp;c. and the application of fomentations, rubefacients, and bli&s;ters to the local affection, is a proof that they are di&s;ea&s;es of indirect debility.</P>
<P>THE langour, inability to motion, want of ap|petite, nau&s;ea, co&s;tivene&s;s, &amp;c. which occur in the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, are evidently incompatible with &s;uch a &s;tate, as that of exce&s;&s;ive excitement. Could &s;uch a &s;tate po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t, the functions of the body would be invigorated, in the exact degree of the exce&s;s.</P>
<P>IN convale&s;cence from the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, it is well known, that a greater degree of nutritious food, wine, and other &s;timuli, are nece&s;&s;ary, than in a &s;tate of health. But if they depended upon a &s;tate of exce&s;&s;ive excitement, the cure could not otherwi&s;e be effected, than by per&s;evering in an ab&s;traction of &s;timuli, until health was re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ed. The exhibition of &s;timulant powers would produce an increa&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>SMALL-POX and meazles are of this kind, and to be cured only by &s;timulant powers.</P>
<P>THE mode in which Brown fell into error, in
<PB N="46" REF="033254_0038_0ff6a72e4437f8a8">
con&s;idering &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es as depending upon a &s;tate of exce&s;&s;ive excitement, was probably this. Having &s;till, (altho' contrary to one of his own fundamental principles "that all powers applied to living bodies are &s;timulant,"&mdash;in other words "that there is not a &s;edative in nature,") retained an idea, that tho&s;e medicines, called evacuants, are debilitating; and having found that, under a moderate application of them, together with the other parts of the u&s;ual treatment, patients gene|rally recovered from the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, he was led to conclude, that they depended upon a &s;tate of ex|ce&s;&s;ive excitement.</P>
<P>THE mode of action, however, of tho&s;e me|dicines, &s;eems to have been univer&s;ally mi&s;un|der&s;tood. As all objects, capable of producing an effect upon living bodies, are &s;timulant (x), tho&s;e which produce evacuations mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be included. If a certain quantity of calomel, in|fu&s;ion of &s;enna, &s;alts, or any other cathartic medi|cine, be taken, its immediate effect, like that of opium, camphor, or any other acknowledged &s;timulus, will be an increa&s;ed &s;trength of pul&s;e, a &s;en&s;e of general invigoration, and all the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of increa&s;ed excitement, in proportion to its degree. And this will continue as long as the operation of the medicine. If the do&s;e is &s;ufficient to produce a high degree of excitement,
<PB N="47" REF="033254_0039_0ff6a7adbb88cc88">
a di&s;charge of natural foeces, when the&s;e have previou&s;ly been long retained, will be the con&s;e|quence. Is there any other mode, by which the inte&s;tines may be made to perform their functi|ons, and to expel their contents, but by increa&s;ing their excitement? Certainly not &mdash;But if a greater quantity be given than is nece&s;&s;ary, to en|able the inte&s;tines to expel, with facility, their contents, a new di&s;ea&s;e is produced;&mdash;indirect debility is e&s;tabli&s;hed; and a di&s;charge of mucus, and &s;ometimes of blood, accompanied by di&s;|agreeable &s;en&s;ations, follows; &s;ymptoms which are only to be removed by opium, and other &s;timuli.&mdash;It is not therefore with an intention of evacuating, that tho&s;e medicines &s;hould be given. In diarrhoeas, and incipient dy&s;entery, where the inte&s;tines are evidently in a &s;tate of indirect de|bility, calomel, ca&s;tor oil, and all the other me|dicines called cathartics, in&s;tead of increa&s;ing, invariably dimini&s;h the number of evacuations; and, by a judicious repetition of the do&s;es, cure the di&s;ea&s;e. Tho&s;e medicines, therefore, do not effect cures, by their EVACUANT, but by their STIMULANT POWERS.</P>
<P>AS opium, aether, volatile alkali, wine, &amp;c. when given in an improper manner, dimini&s;h; &s;o the medicines, u&s;ually denominated evacuants, when given in a proper manner, increa&s;e the excitement.</P>

<P N="33">XXXIII.&mdash;THE principles laid down in the preceding pages, re&s;pecting di&s;ea&s;es, which affect the whole body, equally apply to tho&s;e, which effect only a part.</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV.&mdash;AS di&s;ea&s;es, which affect the whole of the body, depend upon, either accumulation or exhau&s;tion of the excitability (vi.); the &s;ame law mu&s;t apply, with equal force, to any of its parts, &s;eparately con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV.&mdash;IF that propo&s;ition (vi.) be true (as it undoubtedly is) it follows, that local di&s;ea&s;es never depend upon a &s;tate of exce&s;&s;ive excitement. Inflammation, therefore, alocal di&s;ea&s;e of the mo&s;t frequent occurence, does not, as has been gene|rally &s;uppo&s;ed, depend on &s;uch a &s;tate; but, like the di&s;ea&s;es of the whole body, which have been de|nominated by Brown, di&s;ea&s;es of exce&s;&s;ive excite|ment, and by others inflammatory, is, on the contra|ry a di&s;ea&s;e of dimini&s;hed excitement, from indirect debility; excepting in the &s;ingle ca&s;e of inflam|mation, produced by the expo&s;ure of any particu|lar part of the body to a high degree of cold. As this propo&s;ition is of con&s;iderable importance, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge upon it. The &s;ymp|toms
<PB N="49" REF="033254_0041_0ff6a7b8e7ae37e8">
of local inflammation are heat, pain, redne&s;s, &s;welling; and, in &s;ecreting &s;urfaces, an increa&s;ed &s;ecretion. It is evident that, in inflammation, an enlargement of the ve&s;&s;els takes place without a proportionate degree of contraction; and that an increa&s;ed quantity of blood flows into them.&mdash;As the effect of &s;timuli, upon the mu&s;cular fibre, is to produce contraction; and as the blood is the appropriate &s;timulus of the arteries; it is evident that, if the&s;e were di&s;ea&s;es of exce&s;&s;ive excitement, an increa&s;ed contraction of the ve&s;&s;els, or a di|minution of their diameters, in proportion to the increa&s;ed quantity of the blood, would take place. If the vigour of a mu&s;cle is a&s;certained, by the force of its contraction, it is clear that every increa&s;e of vigour &s;hould be attended with an in|crea&s;ed force of contraction. If local inflamma|tion, therefore, was a di&s;ea&s;e of exce&s;&s;ive excite|ment, there would be a diminution, in&s;tead of an increa&s;e, of the quantity of blood, in the ve&s;&s;els of the part. But that there is actually an encrea&s;|ed quantity of blood, in the ve&s;&s;els of the parts inflamed, is evident in opthalmia, and tho&s;e in|flammations, which are produced, in the cour&s;e of experiments, upon the tran&s;parent membranes of animals. The &s;ame idea too is farther confirm|ed, by the mode of cure, which is univer&s;ally a|dopted, and found &s;ucce&s;sful, in tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es.
<PB N="50" REF="033254_0042_0ff6a7bc429531a0">
The application of bli&s;ters, and inhalation of warm &s;team, in pneumonia, catarrh, and inflammatory &s;ore throat; of vinegar, and ardent &s;pirits, in burns, and &s;calds; warm fomentations, and poul|tices, in phlegmon; &s;olution of volatile alkali, tincture of cantharides, and the different prepara|tions of camphor, in the inflammation of the joints, in acute rheumati&s;m; tincture of opium, and &s;olutions of corro&s;ive &s;ublimate in opthalmia; &mdash;are all &s;o many proofs of the truth of this pro|po&s;ition.</P>

<P>FRANCIS LOTE, aged 35, was admitted into the General Ho&s;pital, at Calcutta, on the 1&s;t of May, 1796.&mdash;At that time, he complained of general pains over his body, with all tho&s;e &s;ymptoms which indicate an exhau&s;ted con&s;titu|tion.

On the 3d of June, when I di&s;continued attending him, his complaints were con&s;iderably relieved, by the u&s;e of Opium. On the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t, he again came under my care, in a &s;tate of extreme debility, with ex|ce&s;&s;ive purging, and bloody &s;tools.

gentlemen. During the la&s;t of the&s;e intervals, he was &s;o extremely weak that, in the act of vo|miting, the right clavicle was fractured, which occa&s;ioned much pain. On that and the two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days, I gave him eighty drops of Tinc|ture of Opium, morning, and evening. On the 24th, in the morning, as no effect &s;eemed to be produced by the medicine, it was ordered to be given three times a day. At one o'clock P. M. the &s;ame day, I was called to him; and found him complaining of violent pain in the bowels, with ince&s;&s;ant purging. He had taken the 2d draught about an hour before. The draught was ordered to be immediately repeated. At 9 P. M. he was not relieved; upon which 150 drops of Tincture of Opium was pre&s;cribed immediately and ordered to be repeated at 12 o'clock. A gly&s;ter, with 200 drops of Tincture of Opium was al&s;o given. On the 25th he was ea&s;ier. The gly&s;ters, with 200 drops of Tincture of Opium, were continued every three hours, and the draught, with 150 drops, was repeated in the evening. On the 26th, in the morning, he was nearly in the &s;ame &s;tate; the gly&s;ters were continued, and the draughts ordered 3 times in the day. At 9 P. M. I found that the relief from the gly&s;ters, was merely temporary, that he had &s;tools every hour, and no inclination to &s;leep. Four hundred drops of Tincture of Opium were

ordered in gly&s;ter, every two hours, and a fourth draught of 200 drops to be taken at 12 o'clock. On the 26th he was ea&s;ier; he had &s;ix or &s;even &s;tools in the night, with le&s;s griping. Slept better than he had done, &s;ince he came to the Ho&s;|pital. His pul&s;e beat about 90 &s;trokes in the minute; previous to this his pul&s;e had been very quick and &s;mall, but the &s;tate of it was not particularly noted; he had 150 drops of Tinc|ture of Opium in the morning, and 200 at 12 o'clock. Four hundred drops were ordered in gly&s;ter, every three hours. One P. M. He had 5 &s;tools &s;ince morning; the gly&s;ters were continued; and a draught of 200 drops or|dered to be taken at 4 o'clock. At 8 P. M. he had 13 &s;tools &s;ince the la&s;t vi&s;it, with a good deal of pain in his bowels. He had not &s;lept; was ordered a draught of four hundred drops of Tincture of Opium at ten o'clock. Augu&s;t the 28th, he had &s;lept a little the preceding night; bowels were ea&s;ier; pul&s;e 80; had draughts of 200 drops every two hours, with the gly&s;ters occa&s;ionally. At 2 P.

day, without pain; and felt a returning appetite. Being a &s;en&s;ible and &s;teady man, he was, at that time, allowed to proportion the &s;trength and frequency of the draughts and gly&s;ters according to his own judgment.&mdash;During the whole of the time that he was under my care, he had an al|lowance of wine from one to two or three bot|tles in the 24 hours, according to exigency.&mdash; From his good &s;en&s;e and punctuality, I have a perfect reliance upon his having conformed to my orders, in every particular, as far as it is po&s;&s;ible for patients, in an ho&s;pital, to do.</P>
<P>THE treatment of this ca&s;e may give &s;ome idea of the manner in which &s;timuli &s;hould be increa&s;ed, in di&s;ea&s;es of great exhau&s;tion, until the quantity is a&s;certained, which is capable of producing the highe&s;t degree of excitement.

The &s;orene&s;s of the mouth, and the increa&s;ed flow of &s;aliva, evince that there is a greater &s;imilitude between the action of opium and mercury, than has yet been acknowledged. The &s;orene&s;s of the mouth and &s;pitting commenced, after the quan|tity of opium was dimini&s;hed. Upon re&s;um|ing the draughts, the mouth became le&s;s &s;ore,

and the flow of &s;alava decrea&s;ed; and upon leaving them off, the &s;orene&s;s and &s;pitting in|crea&s;ed. This was repeatedly remarked by the patient him&s;elf. It &s;hould be ob&s;erved, in or|der to prevent a ra&s;h imitation, where the cir|cum&s;tances are not alike, that the tincture of opium employed; upon this occa&s;ion, was much weaker than what is u&s;ually made in Europe; that a very great degree of exhau&s;tion had taken place; and that the do&s;es were gradually increa&s;ed, from eight drops to five hundred.</P>

<P>THE body of this patient was either not op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+ed, or the appearances upon di&s;&s;ection were neglected to be noted down, at the time; and were con&s;equently forgotten. But from the analogy between this ca&s;e and all the others, in which the mouth could not be affected, in the u&s;ual manner, by mercury, there can &s;carcely be a doubt that the colon and rectum, if not the whole of the abdominal vi&s;cera were in a &s;tate of local di&s;ea&s;e. The ca&s;es of di&s;&s;ection, de&s;|cribed by Mr. Maclean, will explain this point more fully. Of many ca&s;es of dy&s;entery, and other di&s;ea&s;es, that were opened by us, in which &s;alivation could not be produced by mercury, there was not one without confirmed local di&s;ea&s;e of the vi&s;cera, either of the thorax or abdomen, or both.</P>
<P>THOSE, who may look upon the quantity of medicine here pre&s;cribed as extraordinary, &s;hould con&s;ider, that when a patient is evidently in|curable, by the common practice, it becomes the duty of the practitioner to depart from it.
<PB N="68" REF="033254_0060_0ff6a81f6af07650">
An oppo&s;ite conduct is dictated, much more by a &s;ly regard to reputation, than an earne&s;t and con&s;cientious de&s;ire of &s;aving the lives of patients. Nothing can be more ea&s;y than to take &s;helter under cu&s;tomary forms.</P>

In the fall, he fir&s;t &s;truck with his hip, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, again&s;t an iron &s;tauncheon in the main-top, which bent; he then came upon the mizzen-&s;tay, which took him, as far as could be collected from the confu&s;|ed intelligence of &s;ome people upon deck, about the middle of the abdomen; and from the &s;tay he fell upon the quarter-deck. He was, as may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, entirely in&s;en&s;ible; much blood was di&s;charged from his mouth, no&s;e, ears, and even from his eyes; in this &s;tate he was carried down to his cabbin; upon examina|tion, no fracture was found; the whole con&s;e|quences of the fall &s;eemed to con&s;i&s;t of contu&s;i|ons or concu&s;&s;ion, the marks of which were very

general over his body. His pul&s;e was &s;mall, but regular. There happened to be in the &s;hip four profe&s;&s;ional gentlemen, be&s;ides my&s;elf. They all &s;eemed of opinion, that Mr. G. &s;hould imme|diately lo&s;e blood. Some of them in&s;i&s;ted upon it, with much earne&s;tne&s;s; and the by-&s;tanders, knowing that to be the common practice, joined in urging a compliance. I replied, that, how|ever common the practice might be, I was con|vinced of its being entirely wrong; and that I would not, even with the &s;anction of a majority, do what I was certain mu&s;t endanger the life of my patient. But that if any of the gentlemen pre&s;ent, cho&s;e to take charge of Mr.&mdash;G, they might have an opportunity of bleeding him, with propriety, if convinced in their con&s;cience that it was right; and I would give them my opinion when a&s;ked. This offer was not accepted. Mr. G. was not bled. In the cour&s;e of two hours from the accident, he became &s;en&s;ible; was &s;ick at &s;tomach, and vomited. This, as a &s;ymptom of concu&s;&s;ion u&s;ually enumerated, would far|ther indicate, according to the hypothe&s;es of the &s;chools, and the practice of ho&s;pitals, copious blood-letting. That, however, did not alter my plan. I was aware indeed that, if the pati|ent died, his death would be attributed to the non-ob&s;ervance of cu&s;tomary forms. But I was
<PB N="76" REF="033254_0068_0ff6a833ebc77d30">
al&s;o per&s;uaded that, if he lived, after having been copiou&s;ly bled, it would be in &s;pite of the blood-letting. He was my friend, as well as my patient; and in defiance of obloquy, I deter|mined to do what appeared to me be&s;t, in order to &s;ave his life. Externally the mo&s;t powerful &s;timulating &s;ub&s;tances were applied, in concour&s;e or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. For four days he could not move in bed, without excruciating pain. He had &s;mall opiates occa&s;ionally, wine, and nouri&s;hing food; and once half an ounce of &s;al catharticus amarus, &s;o as to produce one &s;tool. Nothing more was done. He had not an unfavourable &s;ymptom. The pains gradually abated; and on the eighth day, from the fall, he was carried upon deck in a chair.</P>
<P>THAT there was ab&s;olutely a con&s;iderable de|gree of concu&s;&s;ion in this ca&s;e appears, from his having wholly lo&s;t the &s;ight of one eye, although, when the marks of contu&s;ion had di&s;appeared from that &s;ide of his face, the eye looked almo&s;t as well as the other. He complained at times of headach, which was always relieved by wrapping up his head in warm cloths.</P>
<P>THE i&s;&s;ue of this, as well as of every other ca&s;e of contu&s;ion or concu&s;&s;ion, which I have &s;een treated, either in or out of ho&s;pitals, convinced
<PB N="77" REF="033254_0069_0ff6a835d7bc89c0">
me, that blood-letting is not only unnece&s;&s;ary but pernicious. In private practice, I fear, a mean and criminal compliance with vulgar prejudice, in order to conciliate vulgar favour, too often influences practitioners, who&s;e better judgments would lead them to reject intirely &s;o deplorable a remedy:&mdash;a remedy of which the u&s;e is not only contrary to all principle; but which, &s;o far as I know, cannot adduce a &s;ingle uncontrovert|ible fact, in proof of its utility.</P>

The draughts were continued.&mdash;14th, he was not &s;o well as the day before; his pul&s;e was 96 in the morning, and 92 in the evening, and his tongue rather foul. The medicines were continued. On the 15th, his &s;kin, tongue, and pul&s;e, ap|proached nearly to the healthy &s;tandard. He expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to eat, and was ordered to have chicken broth. The powders and draughts were continued. On the 16th, he had no fe|veri&s;h &s;ymptom, his tongue was &s;ore at the edges, and there was an increa&s;ed flow of &s;aliva. The powders were omitted, and the draughts conti|ed. From that period, he was convale&s;cent, and only took one draught occa&s;ionally at night. On

the 23d, he was free from complaint, and di&s;|charged from the Ho&s;pital.&mdash;During the whole of the time, he was allowed wine and porter, as at fir&s;t pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>THIS ca&s;e is not given as an uncommon one, either in re&s;pect to the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e, or the quantity of medicines that were pre&s;crib|ed. The hi&s;tory of it &s;hews, that the &s;um of &s;ti|mulant power fir&s;t applied, was inadequate to effect a cure, even in a ca&s;e of &s;light di&s;ea&s;e; for the &s;ymptoms by no means approached to the &s;everity of typhus gravior. In every fever, what|ever be its no&s;ological de&s;cription, the &s;ame plan would have been pur&s;ued, increa&s;ing or dimi|ni&s;hing the force of the exciting powers, in pro|portion to the degree of indirect debility. If &s;uch a quantity, as was u&s;ed here, be nece&s;&s;ary for the cure of mild typhus, what powerful &s;ti|muli mu&s;t often be required in typhus gravior, dy|&s;entery, or plague?</P>
<P>THE intervals, I think, at which the medicines were repeated, are too long. The duration of the action of each do&s;e of mercury or jallap is not, perhaps near &s;o much as four hours&mdash;pro|bably not more than one. But whatever it be, &s;uch is the period exactly, at which do&s;es ought to be repeated.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="033254_0074_0ff6a847d1caee80">IN this, as well as in many ca&s;es, both of dy|&s;entery and fever, I have given ca&s;tor oil, jallap, and other cathartics, with a view &s;imply to in|crea&s;e the excitement. In &s;o far as they effect that, and thereby invigorate the functions of life, they are proportionally as u&s;eful as opium, aether, mercury, brandy, wine, or bark. But the purging I conceive to be proportionally as in|jurious a con&s;equence, and as much a mark of in|direct debility, as the headach, &s;ickne&s;s, and vom|iting, which follow an exce&s;&s;ive or irregular u&s;e of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances.

<P>JOHN BROWN, aged 28, was admitted in|to the General Ho&s;pital, at Calcutta, on the 10th of July, 1796, with typhus fever&mdash;He had be&s;ides a &s;ore leg, and chancres. His fever, although apparently &s;light, was very ob&s;tinate. In the cour&s;e of two months, he was &s;everal times almo&s;t cured, by &s;mall and frequently repeated quantities of opium, mercury, wine, and bark, varied accor|ding to circum&s;tances. But, &s;eemingly in con&s;e|quence of internal local affection, he as often re|lap&s;ed, without any apparent cau&s;e. His fever,
<PB N="83" REF="033254_0075_0ff6a84a05559da8">
from continued became remittent, and from re|mittent intermittent. On the 24th of September, &s;u&s;pecting the exi&s;tence of local di&s;ea&s;e, I repre|&s;ented to him the nece&s;&s;ity of undergoing &s;uch a cour&s;e of mercury as to affect his mouth, to which he had hitherto expre&s;&s;ed an in&s;uperable aver&s;ion. He had, for &s;ome days previou&s;ly, taken calomel in &s;mall do&s;es; and had latterly two emetics, at his own reque&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That tartar emetic is a &s;timulant of very high power is evident, from the &s;mall quantity of it, which produces the &s;tate of indirect debility, that occa&s;ions vomiting. It &s;hould be given in &s;uch a manner, as to increa&s;e and to &s;upport the excitement. But this will be found difficult, as the duration of its action &s;eems to be even &s;horter than that of opium. If its action does not continue more than a quarter of an hour, might it not be repeated at &s;uch &s;hort intervals, and the do&s;es &s;o gradually reduced, as not to allow the e&s;tabli&s;hment of in|direct debility? If, when given at &s;uch a random rate, as to produce vomiting, and the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations that can be imagined, medicines &s;ometimes produce good effects, how much more u&s;eful mu&s;t they be, when given according to ju&s;t principles? The prejudices of patients may &s;ometimes be turned to their advantage, by judiciou&s;ly alternating &s;timuli, &s;o as to humour their whims. The medical prejudices of the vulgar, are generally dictated by tho&s;e of phy&s;icians. At pre|&s;ent they are as unrea&s;onably in favour of tartar emetic, as they are again&s;t opium.</NOTE> On that day, he was ordered to take ten grains of calomel, and fifteen grains of jallap every four hours.&mdash;25th, he had taken three powders in the cour&s;e of the day, and was exce&s;|&s;ively
<PB N="84" REF="033254_0076_0ff6a850b93f9fd8">
purged and griped through the night<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This is one of many facts that prove purging to be the effect of a &s;tate of indirect debility, occa&s;ioned by the impro|per &s;ubduction of &s;timulant powers. Had the powders been regularly repeated in the night, the purging and griping would not have taken place. This I have ob&s;erved &s;o repeatedly with re&s;pect to calomel, that I have no he&s;itation in a&s;&s;erting it to be an undoubted fact.</NOTE>. He had no fever. Two grains of opium, and four grains of calomel were directed to be taken every three hours, through the day, and four grains of each at bed time.&mdash;26th, the &s;ame plan was con|tinued; and he had no return of fever.&mdash;27th, he had no fever, and his mouth was very &s;ore.

In this ca&s;e, the medicines were by no means cor|rectly exhibited. But it is probable al&s;o, that they were not regularly taken. Salivation, or, in ca&s;es of local di&s;ea&s;e, where &s;alivation cannot be produced, a di&s;charge of blood from the mouth and fauces, does not take place, while the mercu|ry is regularly taken, but when it is either &s;udden|ly laid a&s;ide, or given at improper intervals.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide the &s;ub&s;equent ca&s;es, and the "Treati&s;e on Mercu|ry."</NOTE> The

On the 29th and 30th, he continued the mixture; his mouth was better; he had no fever, and but little purging; and his pul&s;e was 86.&mdash;October the 1&s;t, his pul&s;e was 76, and of good &s;trength; his mouth was much better; and he had no return of fever.

The mix|ture was gradually decrea&s;ed in &s;trength and di&s;|continued. On the 16th of October, he was di&s;|charged, apparently well.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal inferences to be drawn from this ca&s;e. The ob&s;tinacy of the fever convinced me, that it depended upon local di&s;ea&s;e, and de|termined me to give mercury in large do&s;es. The di&s;charge of blood from the mouth and fauces, without a previous increa&s;ed flow of &s;aliva, was an additional proof of the exi&s;tence of internal local affection. And, altho' this patient left the Ho&s;|pital apparently well, I am convinced, from the circum&s;tances mentioned, as well as from an ir|regularity of his bowels, that his abdominal vi&s;|cera were in a di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate, and that his exemp|tion
<PB N="86" REF="033254_0078_0ff6a8589299cb88">
from general di&s;ea&s;e was merely temporary. From the&s;e ob&s;ervations, I would not be under|&s;tood to infer, that mercury acts as a <HI>&s;pecific</HI> in re|moving local di&s;ea&s;e; but that, by &s;upporting the exeitement of the whole body, it invigorates each particular part, and thus occa&s;ions, to a certain extent, the regeneration of tho&s;e organs, which may have been injured by di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS is not the only in&s;tance, in which the good effects of opium have been experienced, where an exce&s;&s;ive &s;alivation, or a di&s;charge of blood from the fauces, after the u&s;e of mercury, had taken place. As the&s;e &s;ymptoms happen from too &s;udden a &s;ubduction, or an irregular re|petition of the mercury; &s;o they may be either obviated or removed, by a proper application of the &s;ame power. But as the prejudices of pa|tients will &s;eldom admit of a continuance of the medicine, in the&s;e ca&s;es, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;ub&s;titute &s;ome other &s;timulant power, equiv|alent in force. Tho&s;e which I have found to an|&s;wer be&s;t, are opium bli&s;ters, and the warm bath. Other &s;timuli, ju&s;tly proportioned, might no doubt an&s;wer equally well. But from the end|le&s;s hypothe&s;es of the art, no &s;ucce&s;sful attempts have yet been made to a&s;certain their relative powers. This is a di&s;covery, which, however di&s;tant, I am yet &s;anguine enough to expect.

<P>HENRY DOLLAWAL, aged 26, was admitted into the General Ho&s;pital, on the even|ing of the 22d of October, 1796. He had, for a fortnight before, complained of headach, pain of loins, hoar&s;ene&s;s, and cough, &amp;c. pul&s;e 58.

Four grains of opium and ten grains of calomel were ordered to be taken immediate|ly,
<PB N="88" REF="033254_0080_0ff6a86551678d18">
and repeated at 12 o'clock.&mdash;25th, he was &s;eized in the morning with violent &s;pa&s;ms. Pul&s;e 64. He was put into the warm bath, which was ordered to be repeated according to circum&s;tan|ces. Afterwards, two grains of opium and four grains of calomel were directed to be taken eve|ry two hours, day and night.&mdash;26th, he was much better, and had no cough. The pills were continued.&mdash;27th, he thought him&s;elf better. His pul&s;e beat only 44 &s;trokes in the minute. The pills were repeated every three hours.&mdash; 28th, his mouth was gently affected. Two grains of opium and two grains of calomel were given every three hours.&mdash;29th, he was in every re&s;pect better, had &s;ome &s;light &s;pitting, and felt a returning appetite. Pul&s;e 68.&mdash;One grain of opium and one grain of calomel were given eve|ry four hours.&mdash;On the 30th, he was di&s;charged well.</P>
<P>AN uncommonly flu&s;hed countenance, and what is called a plethoric habit, together with an unu&s;ual &s;lowne&s;s of pul&s;e, hoar&s;ene&s;s, cough, and pains, would have indicated, according to the common practice, blood-letting and other evacu|ations, in this ca&s;e. The powers, however, by which a cure was effected, proved, that the&s;e &s;ymp|toms depended upon a &s;tate of indirect debili|ty; and that the u&s;e of debilitating powers, would have been improper. For the &s;ame rea|&s;on,
<PB N="89" REF="033254_0081_0ff6a816031805d0">
it may be inferred, that a peculiar &s;lowne&s;s, as well as a quickne&s;s of the pul&s;e, &s;ometimes takes place in a &s;tate of indirect debility. Every departure of the pul&s;e from the healthy &s;tandard, whether in quickne&s;s or &s;lowne&s;s, depends upon debility; as well as every deviation from health, in any of the other functions. Co&s;tivene&s;s, as well as purging, depends upon debility of the in|te&s;tinal canal. This is &s;hewn from patients affect|ed with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e having, in &s;ome ca&s;es a quickne&s;s, in others, a &s;lowne&s;s of pul&s;e; in &s;ome ca&s;es purging, in others co&s;tivene&s;s; and all of them being cured by the &s;ame means. It is farther corroborated by the proof, that &s;uch a &s;tate as that of exce&s;&s;ive excitement, cannot take place. As blood-letting is the ab&s;traction of a high &s;timulant power, it mu&s;t be &s;hewn that di&s;ea&s;es of evce&s;&s;ive excitement exi&s;t, before it can be admitted as a remedy. Or if it be con|tended that blood-letting is u&s;eful in di&s;ea&s;es of debility, it mu&s;t be &s;hewn that it acts as a &s;timu|lant power. Mere a&s;&s;ertions that it has been found u&s;eful, do not amount to a &s;ufficient refuta|tion of this rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>THERE was an error of &s;ome importance in the treatment of this ca&s;e, which affords the mo&s;t convincing proof of the nece&s;&s;ity of repeating the do&s;es of medicines, at certain regular inter|vals, and by a certain rule.&mdash;On the morning of the 25th,&mdash;after having taken four grains of
<PB N="90" REF="033254_0082_0ff6a868736d3110">

This &s;ymptom, as I have had frequent opportu|nities of ob&s;erving, was undoubtedly owing to the do&s;es not having been repeated at proper inter|vals. If a do&s;e of equal &s;trength, or one &s;omewhat &s;maller, had been given at three, and another &s;till &s;maller, at &s;ix o'clock in the morn|ing, the &s;tate of indirect debility, con&s;tituting &s;pa&s;m, would not have taken place. As the&s;e &s;ymptoms may be occa&s;ioned, or prevented, at plea&s;ure, the fact is incontrovertible. In this ca&s;e, they immediately yielded to the &s;timulant power of the warm bath,&mdash;another proof that they aro&s;e from a &s;tate of indirect debility, oc|ca&s;ioned by a deficient frequency or force, in the application of &s;timulant powers. Opium, calo|mel, camphor, aether, or ca&s;tor oil, given in ju&s;t proportions, would have produced the &s;ame effect with the warm bath. But external appli|cations may often, with great advantage and con|veniency, be alternated, or conjoined, with in|ternal remedies.</P>

on the 28th of October, with a quick and &s;mall pul&s;e, laborious breathing, pain of back, loins, &amp;c. His face was turgid; and his eyes red and &s;tarting. His tongue was foul and furred. He reported that he was attacked with fever, &s;even or eight days before, which had become more &s;evere and continued for the la&s;t two days. Some medicines had been taken before he came into the Ho&s;pital.&mdash;At 3 o'clock P. M. when I fir&s;t &s;aw him, ten grains of calomel were order|ed to be taken every three hours. At 10 P.

A bli&s;ter was applied to his &s;ternum. On the 29th of October, his pul&s;e was 120, with burning heat of &s;kin. His tongue felt like a rough board. He had one &s;mall &s;tool in the morning.

<P>UPON di&s;&s;ection, the thoracic vi&s;cera were found adhering to each other, in &s;uch a manner as to form but one ma&s;s. The lungs adhered to the pleurae, media&s;tinum, and diaphragm; the heart to the pericardium; and the pericardium to all the &s;urrounding parts. The adhe&s;ions were remarkably &s;trong as well as general. The lungs were of a darker blue than u&s;ual. Upon a gene|ral view of the abdominial vi&s;cera, they appear|ed to be &s;ound. The &s;crotum was gangrenous. In one of the arms, there was the mark of a re|cent inci&s;ion, made by a lancet.</P>
<P>THIS was undoubtedly a ca&s;e of the mo&s;t vio|lent peripneumony. According to the common practice, the patient would have been repeatedly bled. Would the ab&s;traction of blood have pro|duced a re&s;olution of the adhe&s;ions, which were found in the thorax? The greate&s;t partizan of the practice, I think, would &s;carcely affirm it. According to the confu&s;ed notions entertained of peripneumony being a di&s;ea&s;e of exce&s;&s;ive ex|citement, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary, in order to pre|&s;erve &s;ome appearance of con&s;i&s;tency, to divide

the di&s;ea&s;e into different &s;tages; and to u&s;e a different or even an oppo&s;ite plan of treatment, in each. Is it po&s;&s;ible that any di&s;ea&s;e can vary in its progre&s;s, excepting in degree? And if not, ought the powers applied for the cure to be varied, in the progre&s;s of any di&s;ea&s;e, except|ing in their degree of force? The&s;e would ap|pear to be the conclu&s;ions of rea&s;on and com|mon &s;en&s;e. But to overturn &s;uch flim&s;y ar|guments, come in medical hypothe&s;es and &s;ay
<Q>inflammation we <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> ari&s;es from an increa&s;|ed impetus of the blood in the part affected, and is <HI>therefore</HI> to be cured by dimini&s;hing the quantity of that blood. In peripneumo|ny, there is an inflammation of the lungs; and in order to cure the di&s;ea&s;e, the impetus of the blood in the lungs mu&s;t be le&s;&s;ened by blood-letting.</Q>
To this curious fabric of "rea&s;oning, I will ju&s;t oppo&s;e a &s;ingle fact.&mdash; There is not an inflammation, with which we are acquainted, that is not to be cured (as far as it is curable) by the application of &s;timulant pow|ers,&mdash;as warm fomentations, tincture of opium, tincture of cantharides, camphorated &s;pirits, aether, volatile alkali, and mercury. If any per|&s;on &s;eriou&s;ly doubts the fact, it will be an ea&s;y matter to &s;ubmit it to the te&s;t of experiment.&mdash; And if there be any other rea&s;on, for per&s;ever|ing in the practice of blood-letting, than be|cau&s;e it is derived from the hypothe&s;es of the
<PB N="94" REF="033254_0086_0ff6a873c75ecb88">
&s;chools, and is conformable to cu&s;tom, let it be produced. That blood-letting had been u&s;ed, in this ca&s;e, previous to the patient's having been &s;ent into the ho&s;pital, appears probable from the inci&s;ion in the arm:&mdash;that he was purged is known. As catharticks, however, produce an increa&s;ed degree of excitement, before the debili|tating operation of purging &s;ucceeds, their &s;timu|lant effects will often more than counterbalance the indirectly debilitating effects, which after|wards ari&s;e. But as blood-letting is a directly debilitating operation,&mdash; the ab&s;traction of an or+dinary and powerful &s;timulus,&mdash;it mu&s;t always be highly injurious. In di&s;ea&s;es of direct debility, as far as they can become &s;ubjects of medical treat|ment, it mu&s;t add to the accumulation; in tho&s;e of indirect debility, it mu&s;t increa&s;e the exhau&s;ti|on (<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide, "View of the Science of Life," Prop. XXVI.</NOTE>). It is upon the &s;uppo&s;ition alone that &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es depend upon a &s;tate of exce&s;&s;ive excite|ment, that blood-letting can ever be thought admi&s;&s;ible. And that &s;uch a &s;tate does not exi&s;t has, in my opinion been fully proved. I know it will be urged, by individuals, that they have found blood-letting u&s;eful. But this, like many other medical facts, is mere a&s;&s;ertion, not proof. Whatever has been u&s;eful in one ca&s;e, mu&s;t be u&s;eful in every &s;imilar ca&s;e of di&s;|ea&s;e. But it is not &s;o with blood-letting.&mdash;It
<PB N="95" REF="033254_0087_0ff66b695e6c0e30">
has not invariably been found u&s;eful in any one di&s;ea&s;e. We may therefore, I think, fairly con|clude, that it has never been u&s;eful in any one ca&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e. If it be &s;aid that this is rea&s;on|ing, and that experience; let me be permit|ted to a&s;k whether ju&s;t rea&s;oning and real experi|ence can ever differ? It is impo&s;&s;ible.&mdash;Whate|ver is true in theory, mu&s;t be right in practice. To inculcate a contrary opinion is the grand &s;hield of empirici&s;m. Circum&s;tances delivered as facts, from the pre&s;umed experience of indivi|duals, ought never to weigh again&s;t principles, which are deduced from numerous and undoubt|ed facts, and which can be put to the te&s;t of ex|periment by all mankind.</P>
<P>THE quantity of calomel given here was large. But after taking two &s;cruples at two do&s;es, and allowing time for the operation of purging from indirect debility to take place, only one &s;canty &s;tool was produced. This &s;hews clearly, that, although the quantity was large, in proportion to what is u&s;ually given, it was by no means &s;ufficiently large in proportion to the exhau&s;tion of excitability that had taken place; or, in other words, to the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e. Altho' it be extremely doubtful whether the excitability can ever be accumulated to the healthy &s;tandard, by any degree of &s;timulant power, when &s;o many
<PB N="96" REF="033254_0088_0ff6a876686fc6b0">
principal organs have become unable to perform their functions; yet it is certain that, in order to give a patient, in &s;uch cirum&s;tances, the only chance of cure, the &s;timuli &s;hould be increa&s;ed in power, until they produce &s;ome effect. In this ca&s;e, therefore, the medicines &s;hould have been both increa&s;ed in quantity, and more frequently repeated. But as, in every kind of practice, the prejudices of patients, or carele&s;sne&s;s of attend|ants, will frequently render it impo&s;&s;ible &s;trictly to adhere to the application of principles, we can only make &s;uch an approach to them, as the&s;e, and other circum&s;tances, will permit.</P>
<P>HAD it not been my wi&s;h to bring the theory and practice of this doctrine to the fulle&s;t and fair|e&s;t proof of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and experiment, this is one of tho&s;e ca&s;es which I would have &s;uppre&s;&s;|ed. It is to be regretted that writers do not oft|ener think it nece&s;&s;ary to publi&s;h their un&s;ucce&s;s|ful, as well as their &s;ucce&s;sful ca&s;es.</P>

From that period till the 23d, the opium and calomel, from two to four grains of the one, and
<PB N="103" REF="033254_0095_0ff6a7ff77496970">
from &s;ix to ten grains of the other, were alter|nated with the mixture; the ointment was rub|bed occa&s;ionally; and the draughts, with from 60 to 100 drops of tincture of opium were giv|en at night, or 3 or 4 grains of opium, which|ever he &s;eemed inclined to prefer. From the 23d of October, to the 18th of November, he appeared to be &s;o much better, that, although confident of the exi&s;tence of much internal local di&s;ea&s;e, I was not without hopes, that it was of &s;uch a degree as to admit of a reproduction of parts. His pul&s;e varied from 80 to 96. The do&s;es of medicines were con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed. Camphor, four grains every two hours, was al|ternated occa&s;ionally with the calomel and opi|um. Gly&s;ters, with one ounce of ca&s;tor oil, were &s;ometimes given every hour, or every two hours; and two pounds of decoction of bark, with an ounce of powder, was given in the day. The ointment, and calomel pills were gradually di|mini&s;hed, to two drachms of the former, four times in the day; and two grains of the latter, every two hours. His &s;ickne&s;s and vomiting &s;till recurred. The burning &s;en&s;ations of the abdomen continued.

The other me|dicines (viz. decoction of bark, gly&s;ters, and draughts) were at the &s;ame time, de&s;ired to be continued.&mdash;20th, he had frequent &s;ickne&s;s, and vomiting; much purging, and great thir&s;t.

Two pounds of decoction of bark, with half an ounce of aether, was given, in the cour&s;e of the day; and the draughts were repeated.&mdash;22d, his &s;ymp|toms continued as before.

The ulcers were, in many places, an inch in diameter; and had penetrated the two inner coats. It is &s;omewhat remarkable that, in between thirty and forty ca&s;es of dy&s;entery which I have &s;een opened, there was not, in a &s;ingle in|&s;tance, any of the &s;cybala mentioned by authors, as a &s;ymptom of that di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THE uncommon quantity of mercury that was here u&s;ed, without being followed by any affecti|on of the mouth, was a &s;ufficient proof that there exi&s;ted a le&s;ion of organs, which, if curable, re|quired the application of &s;till higher powers than tho&s;e that were employed. Even in external lo|cal affections, it is now well known, that a cure depends more upon the &s;upport of the general ex|citement, than upon local applications. The cure then, of internal local di&s;ea&s;e, were it even po&s;&s;ible to apply local remedies, mu&s;t &s;till be per|formed by the application of powers, calculated to &s;upport the general excitement.</P>
<P>WE have yet, perhaps, no adequate idea of the degree of power, that may &s;ometimes be re|quired, to produce this effect. But it is very certain that, while in &s;ome ca&s;es by far too little, in others by far too much of &s;timulant power is applied. Mercury, for in&s;tance, in ca&s;es of dy|&s;entery, is generally u&s;ed in too &s;mall proporti|ons,
<PB N="107" REF="033254_0099_0ff6a8a21f9c77e0">
while in venereal ca&s;es, it is by much too freely given. Half a grain of calomel, or le&s;s, given every two or three hours, will in a &s;hort time effect a cure in ordinary ca&s;es of chancre, gonorrhoea, or even a certain degree of &s;yphilis. In the&s;e ca&s;es, there is &s;eldom any great degree of organic le&s;ion, at lea&s;t of tho&s;e organs which are mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to life. It is only when &s;ome of the primary organs are in a &s;tate of local di&s;|ea&s;e, that a great and long continued application, of high &s;timulant powers, becomes nece&s;&s;ary, in order to re-produce health. Of this, dy&s;entery is one of the mo&s;t familiar and fatal examples.</P>
<P>The diminution of the medicines that was made at one period, upon the pro&s;pect of the pa|tient being better, was injudicious. Although, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, no plan would probably have &s;uc|ceeded, a per&s;everance in the regular application of high exciting powers, would have given him one chance of recovery.</P>
<P>THE offen&s;ive &s;tate of his breath, of which he complained on the 18th of November, was evi|dently occa&s;ioned by the &s;ubduction of the medi|cines. This is a &s;ymptom of indirect debility, as well as &s;alivation, purging, &s;weat, or any other effect of an irregular application, or &s;udden &s;ub|duction, of mercury.

that medicine, ought not to &s;urpri&s;e us. It is al&s;o obvious that if, when given at random, this and other medicines of high &s;timulant pow|er &s;o frequently produce good effects, their &s;alu|tary effects, when applied according to ju&s;t prin|ciples, may be expected to &s;urpa&s;s any thing, of which we can yet form an idea.</P>

<P>JOHN CLUFF, aged 30, was admitted into the General Ho&s;pital, at Calcutta, on the 18th of November, 1796, with a dy&s;entery of &s;ome days &s;tanding. He had ince&s;&s;ant calls to &s;tool, pa&s;&s;ed blood, with &s;evere griping, tene&s;|mus, and prolap&s;us ani. His thir&s;t was inten&s;e; and he &s;eemed in dreadful agony, from lancinat|ing pains. Six grains of opium, and eight grains of calomel, were ordered to be given every hour; a gly&s;ter, with three ounces of ca&s;tor oil, and three ounces of warm water every hour; and half an ounce of mercurial ointment to be rub|bed in, four times in the day. A bottle of Ma|deira, in two quarts of barley water, was pre|&s;cribed for drink. At twelve o'clock, A. M. he had taken two of the pills, and &s;eemed ea&s;ier.
<PB N="109" REF="033254_0101_0ff6a8aad831e8a0">
In con&s;equence of a con&s;ultation, the pills were or|dered to be omitted, and two ounces of the follow|ing mixture to be given every half hour;&mdash;viz. Sal. Cathart. Amar. ten drachms, Crem. Tart. two drachms, Tart. Emetic two grains, water one pint. A draught, with one hundred drops of tincture of opium, was ordered at eight o'clock, and another at twelve. November the 19th, after having taken the mixture, he was both vo|mited and purged. The&s;e operations continued occa&s;ionally during the night, and were not en|tirely &s;topped by the draughts. His pul&s;e was 92, tongue foul, and thir&s;t inten&s;e; he complain|ed of great pain acro&s;s the umbilical region; and pa&s;&s;ed blood in his &s;tools. The mixture was ordered to be repeated; the ointment and gly&s;ters to be continued; warm fomentations to be u&s;ed; and three draughts, with one hundred and fifty drops of tincture of opium in each, were ordered to be given at night, at intervals of three hours. No|vember the 20th, he was much better. His tongue, however, was foul. The gly&s;ters did not &s;eem to produce much effect. The mix|ture, ointment and draughts were ordered to be repeated; and the gly&s;ters to be di&s;conti|nued.&mdash;21&s;t, having, on the evening of the 19th, taken his three draughts at once, in the cour&s;e of ye&s;terday, he became rather confu&s;ed; and was di&s;&s;uaded, by one of his comrades, from tak|ing
<PB N="110" REF="033254_0102_0ff6a8af3425f9c0">
the draughts the night before as pre&s;cribed. He appeared much confu&s;ed; but the purging was le&s;s &s;evere. The mixture, ointment, and draughts, with one hundred drops in each, were de&s;ired to be repeated. 22d, he was again di&s;|&s;uaded, with the be&s;t intentions however, from taking his draughts; in con&s;equence of which his confu&s;ion increa&s;ed, and he ran about the ward, in a &s;tate of con&s;iderable derangement, all night. I repre&s;ented to his friend, who had with-held the medicines through kindne&s;s, the danger of per&s;evering in &s;uch conduct; and en|treated that he would exhibit the do&s;es exactly as they were pre&s;cribed, which he afterwards punctually did. But in order to en&s;ure a com|pliance, I thought it be&s;t occa&s;ionally to vary the remedies, and to u&s;e &s;uch as &s;hould fall in with the prejudices of the patient and his friend. Accordingly one drachm of jallap was immedi|ately given. The warm bath was de&s;ired to be u&s;ed three times a day; and after the bath, two drachms of mercurial ointment to be rub|bed in each time.&mdash;When the operation of purg|ing &s;hould commence, after the exhibition of the jallap, a pill, con&s;i&s;ting of four grains of opium, and &s;ix of calomel, was directed to be given every hour; and to be continued through the night, in lieu of the draughts.&mdash;23d, in the cour&s;e of
<PB N="111" REF="033254_0103_0ff6a801c84c63c0">
the preceding day and night, he had taken nine pills, con&s;i&s;ting of four grains of opium and &s;ix of calomel each. He &s;lept well; had little purg|ing; and was free from pain. He only complained of weakne&s;s and thir&s;t. The pills were re|duced to two grains of opium, and four grains of calomel, every two hours. The ointment was continued; and the bath and gly&s;ters omitted.&mdash; 24th, he was better. He &s;till pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome blood by &s;tool, and had a difficulty in making water. He complained that his mouth was &s;ore. The&s;e &s;ymptoms I judged to have ari&s;en, either from the &s;ubduction of &s;timulus the day before having been two great, or the patient having neglected to take the quantity that was pre&s;cribed. The medicines were de&s;ired to be continued; and the patient was particularly enjoined to take them regularly.&mdash;25th, his mouth was le&s;s &s;ore, he had fewer &s;tools, and no blood in them; his &s;kin was moi&s;t and his pul&s;e 80.&mdash;26th, pul&s;e 88, and &s;maller. Purging and griping continued. By mi&s;take, he had no pills during the night. This fully accounted for the alteration &s;ince the day before. He was ordered to have a quart of de|coction of bark, with two hundred drops of tinc|ture of opium, to be taken in divided do&s;es through the day. Two drachms of mercurial ointment, and one drachm of calomel, were rub|bed
<PB N="112" REF="033254_0104_0ff6a8b16318c590">
in four times in the day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the 26th and 27th there was an omi&s;&s;ion, in not pre|&s;cribing draughts or pills, &s;ufficient to &s;upport the excitement in the night.</NOTE>. On the 27th, he was rather better; the medicines were continu|ed; on the 28th, he was much the &s;ame; the decoction, with two hundred drops of tincture of opium, was continued.&mdash;He did not always take the whole of the decoction; but generally more than two thirds of it. The ointment was dimini&s;hed to one drachm four times in the day; and two draughts, with eighty drops of tincture of opium in each, were ordered to be given in the night.&mdash;29th, he had taken the draughts and &s;lept well; had only one &s;tool; pul&s;e 84;&mdash; tongue clean; he felt &s;ome degree of oppre&s;&s;ion about the pit of the &s;tomach; a bli&s;ter was appli|ed; the ointment was omitted; the decoction of bark, with tincture of opium, was ordered to be continued; and the draughts to be re|duced to &s;ixty drops. From that period, he continued to get better. The &s;timuli were in|crea&s;ed, or dimini&s;hed, according to cir|cum&s;tances; and on the 12th of December, he was di&s;charged without any complaint, except|ing a little griping at times. At his own reque&s;t, he had a &s;mall phial of tincture of opium, and &s;ome pills, with directions how to take them, if
<PB N="113" REF="033254_0105_0ff6a8b39625f3d0">
required, before he could join his &s;hip at Dia|mond Harbour.</P>
<P>WHEN, in con&s;equence of con&s;ultations, as happened in this ca&s;e, cathartics were exhibited, I endeavoured &s;o to manage them, as regularly to &s;upport the excitement; and to prevent, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the &s;tate of indirect debility, which con|&s;titutes vomiting and purging, by exhibiting other &s;timuli, on the commencement of the&s;e opera|tions. But this is generally very difficult to ac|compli&s;h, principally from the ideas, which pa|tients traditionally imbibe, of the utility of the&s;e operations.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the hitherto uncertain &s;tate of the art, it is not &s;urprizing that con&s;ultations, in which, to u&s;e the words of an elegant writer," learned phy&s;icians neutralize their plans,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aikin's Letters to his Son.</NOTE>" &s;hould &s;eldom be productive of benefit to patients. They are too often &s;cenes of mutual complai&s;ance, in which he, who has mo&s;t to gain, &s;acrifices mo&s;t of his opinion. This has been a &s;ubject of much re|gret to &s;en&s;ible men of the profe&s;&s;ion; and &s;uch &s;cenes have con&s;equently been avoided by many of them. It is no mean proof of the truth of the medical principles, a&s;&s;erted in the&s;e pages, that
<PB N="114" REF="033254_0106_0ff6a804b3387510">
two per&s;ons, who thoroughly under&s;tand them, will differ, but in a very &s;mall degree, in their ap|plication to practice. In this re&s;pect, I have known a coincidence &s;o perfect, that it could, in no other manner, be accounted for. Their general adop|tion, then, would bani&s;h that vulgar adage, which, at pre&s;ent, not unde&s;ervedly attaches a degree of ridicule to the cultivators of the healing art, "doc|tors differ."</P>
<P>IN the report of the 24th of November, it is ob|&s;erved, that the patient had a difficulty in making water, and a &s;orene&s;s of the mouth, which were judged to have ari&s;en, either from the &s;ubduc|tion of &s;timulus, on the 23d, having been too great, or his having neglected to u&s;e the quantity pre&s;cribed. This is not hypothe&s;is; but a clear induction of facts. It is certain, that a difficulty of making water, is a &s;ymptom that ari&s;es from a &s;tate of indirect debility, whether that &s;ucceeds the exhibition of cantharides, opium, or any other &s;timulant power. It is al&s;o true, that it may be cured by opium, the warm bath, or cantharides. The general mode of applying bli&s;ters is &s;uch, as often to induce that &s;tate; and is therefore im|proper. Bli&s;ters of a &s;mall &s;ize, frequently repeat|ed, will produce a regular excitement, like &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive frictions of mercurial ointment. But they ought not to lay on the &s;kin ten or twelve hours;
<PB N="115" REF="033254_0107_0ff6a8b5a28dcf58">
nor &s;o long as to be &s;ucceeded by ve&s;ication, which is a &s;tate of indirect debility. Neither is it nece&s;|&s;ary that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey &s;hould be applied, in preference, to any particular &s;pot. For, although they make the fir&s;t, and a &s;omewhat greater impre&s;&s;ion, upon the part, with which they come immediately in con|tact; yet, to whatever part of the body they are ap|plied, their action will extend to every other. The action of &s;timuli upon the excitability, may be compared to an electric &s;hock, which, &s;eemingly at the &s;ame in&s;tant of time, affects every per&s;on in company,&mdash;the neare&s;t and the mo&s;t di&s;tant from the phial. When the <HI>modus operandi</HI> of the one is a&s;certained, we may expect to a&s;certain the <HI>mo|dus operandi</HI> of the other.</P>
<P>IN the preceding, as well as in many other ca|&s;es, medicines were often exhibited improperly; &s;ometimes from omi&s;&s;ions in pre&s;cribing, &s;ome|times from negligence or mi&s;takes of attendants, and &s;ometimes from the prejudices of the patient.</P>
<P>WITH any number of patients, there cannot be much difficulty in pre&s;cribing, according to the old plan of practice, which con&s;i&s;ts in giving cer|tain fixed do&s;es of medicines, in every di&s;ea&s;e, whatever be its degree. But ju&s;tly to proportion the application of &s;timulant powers, to the ex|hau&s;tion of the excitability of each patient, re|quires more exertion of judgment and con&s;idera|tion, on the part of the practitioner, and a &s;tric|ter conformity with directions, on the part of the
<PB N="116" REF="033254_0108_0ff6a8ba644dd6a8">
patient, and of the attendants. It is evident then that, in an ho&s;pital, it requires an unu&s;ual degree of exertion to apply the&s;e principles to practice, in from thirty to forty bad ca&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e, daily. But it is their introduction only that is difficult. Once generally admitted, their application would be attended with as much facility, and certainly with more plea&s;ure, becau&s;e with more &s;ucce&s;s, than any routine of empirici&s;m.</P>

<P>ISAAC HUDSON, aged 30, was admit|ted into the General Ho&s;pital, at Calcutta, on the 31&s;t of October, 1796, with the following &s;ymptoms: Pul&s;e 132, and &s;mall. He had for &s;ome time feveri&s;h paroxy&s;ms, at 11 o'clock, A. M. and 11 P. M. which continued between two and three hours. Tongue foul; &s;kin hot; his bowels were quite irregular, &s;ometimes extremely loo&s;e, at other times exce&s;&s;ively co&s;tive. He had a cough, with hoar&s;ene&s;s; and pains of the bones and joints. Together with the&s;e com|plaints, he had chancres of a fortnight's &s;tand|ing.&mdash;One grain of opium and one grain of calo|mel were pre&s;cribed every hour; and two drachms of mercurial ointment were ordered to

be rubbed in, three times in the day. Novem|ber the 1&s;t, pul&s;e 96. The fever and purging continued. His pains were rather le&s;s &s;evere. His tongue was very white. Ten grains of calo|mel were given every three hours. On the 2d, his pul&s;e was 92. He had taken four do&s;es of the calomel. His tongue was le&s;s &s;oul. Eight grains of calomel were ordered every three hours, day and night.&mdash;3d, pul&s;e 88; he had taken eight do&s;es of the calomel. He had a &s;ore throat and hoar&s;ene&s;s, with an incipient &s;pitting. The calomel was omitted, becau&s;e it was deem|ed highly probable that he would not have taken it, if pre&s;cribed. Three grains of opium were given every hour. And three drachms of oint|ment were ordered to be rubbed in, three or four times in the day.&mdash;4th, his mouth and throat were very &s;ore, and he &s;pit &s;ome blood; from whence it was concluded, that he had omitted to take his medicines, or that he had u&s;ed them in an irregular manner. A bli&s;ter was applied to one of his cheeks; two grains of opium were giv|en every two hours; and a gly&s;ter, with one ounce of ca&s;tor oil, was ordered every two hours. He was allowed four gla&s;&s;es of wine in the day. On the 5th, his mouth became very &s;ore, and there was &s;ome increa&s;ed flow of &s;aliva. A bli&s;|ter was applied to the other cheek; the pills and gly&s;ters were continued; and he was allowed &s;ix

The pills were ordered to be continued, and a gly&s;|ter, with two ounces of ca&s;tor oil, to be given every &s;econd hour.&mdash;7th, he was much in the &s;ame &s;tate; the medicines were ordered to be con|tined. On the 8th, he had &s;ome difficulty of breathing, his pul&s;e was exceedingly &s;mall, and he had fainting fits. Upon enquiry, it was found that he had lately neglected to take the medicines, which he him&s;elf confe&s;&s;ed. In order to en&s;ure compliance in this re&s;pect, a change was made in the medicines. He was put into the warm bath three times in the day. The gly&s;ters were con|tinued. And he had three draughts, with one hundred drops of tincture of opium in each, at regular intervals in the night. 9th, he was better; his pul&s;e was 108 and &s;tronger. Cough le&s;s &s;evere; and &s;welling of the face abated. The bath, and gly&s;ters were ordered to be repeated; and a draught, with forty drops of tincture of opi|um, to be given every hour.&mdash;10th, he was much in the &s;ame &s;tate; the medicines were con|tinued.

By that &s;ymptom, I could detect his irregularites. He continued, for &s;ome time, &s;ubject to purging, and &s;light paroxy&s;ms of fe|ver occa&s;ionally. But, by a per&s;everance in the &s;ame plan of treatment, diminution of the me|dicines, he remained, on the 13th of December, free from complaint, excepting a &s;light &s;orene&s;s of the mouth.

<P>THIS is one of tho&s;e ca&s;es, which &s;hew that &s;ore|ne&s;s of the mouth, and &s;alivation, do not ari&s;e from the action of mercury, when regularly appli|ed, and gradually decrea&s;ed; but that the&s;e, and other &s;ymptoms of indirect debility, ari&s;e in con|&s;equence of its irregular application, or &s;udden &s;ubduction. This patient, like many others, was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the truth of the above ob&s;ervation that, after there was a nece&s;&s;ity for u&s;ing the warm bath, he took his medicines with much regulari|ty, until he became convale&s;cent. He was, from repeated experience, convinced that the &s;orene&s;s of his mouth increa&s;ed, upon the &s;ubduction of the mercury, opium, or warm bath.</P>
<P>FROM the beginning, I was doubtful of a recov|ery. For, a &s;mall and quick pul&s;e, hoar&s;ene&s;s and difficulty of breathing, and the very irregular &s;tate of his bowels, indicated that &s;ome degree of local

December, when I di&s;continued attending him, he had no complaint, excepting the &s;orene&s;s of his mouth; which, however, was rapidly decrea&s;ing.</P>
<P>WHEN the medicines were increa&s;ed to a due degree, as on the 3d of December, the patient &s;peedily got better; and had he continued to take them with regularity throughout, he would have got well much &s;ooner.

<P>IN the foregoing ca&s;es, in general, the &s;tate of the pul&s;e has been noted with &s;ome care. The pul&s;e in all its degrees of quickne&s;s, &s;lowne&s;s, weakne&s;s, irregularity, and intermi&s;&s;ion, may be con&s;idered as a kind of thermometer, by which, together with the &s;tate of other functions, &s;ome judgment may be formed of the &s;tate of the ex|citement. A deviation from health in the &s;tate of the pul&s;e, is one of the mo&s;t con&s;tant &s;ymp|toms of indirect debility. But the &s;ure&s;t crite|rion yet known, by which to e&s;timate the degree of exhau&s;tion, is the effect produced, by the &s;ti|mulant powers, applied for the cure.</P>
<P>WHEN the effects of the mercurial ointment were not deemed &s;ufficiently powerful, calomel

was added. The ointment u&s;ed was the &s;trong|e&s;t; but the quick-&s;ilver was not always &s;uffici|ently triturated. It is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to ob|&s;erve that, in dangerous ca&s;es, mercury may at the &s;ame time be u&s;ed, both internally and exter|nally, with advantage.</P>
<P>THE explanations annexed to the ca&s;es will, perhaps, appear unnece&s;&s;arily copious; and, in &s;ome parts mere repetitions.

<P>THE preceding ca&s;es, it will be ob&s;erved, are not particularly &s;elected from &s;uch as termi|nated happily. Tho&s;e only that were deemed mo&s;t in&s;tructive, in illu&s;trating particular points, have been cho&s;en. Many more of equal impor|tance might have been added; but the publica|tion would thus have become too voluminous. None of them are offered, as approaching to per|fect examples; but merely as conveying a ge|neral idea of the mode, in which, according to our opinion, the principles of the doctrine &s;hould be applied to practice.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH opium and mercury are the me|dicines, upon which we have placed mo&s;t depen|dance, in di&s;ea&s;es of high degree, as being more intimately acquainted with their powers; it is conceived that the doctrine, properly under&s;tood, embraces the whole range of the Materia Medica. It does not admit, indeed, of any other effect being produced, by the application of any power in nature, to living bodies, than an increa&s;e or
<PB N="128" REF="033254_0120_0ff6a8de40bcf318">
diminution of the vigor, with which they per|form their proper functions; i. e. an increa&s;e or diminution of their excitement. With a view to the excitement &s;olely is every medicine what|ever pre&s;cribed. And when the means employ|ed are un&s;ucce&s;sful, the failure &s;hould be attri|buted to a want of judgment in their application, rather than to any error in the principles them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT ought not to be overlooked that, in mo&s;t of the foregoing examples, the di&s;ea&s;es were tho&s;e of the greate&s;t exhau&s;tion, occurring among a &s;et of men (&s;oldiers, mariners, &amp;c.) po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing robu&s;t con&s;titutions, and accu&s;tomed to the ap|plication of high degrees of &s;timulant power. In di&s;ea&s;es of warm climates, in general, the ex|hau&s;tion is much greater than in tho&s;e of cold climates. Perhaps too, in the former, the me|dicines lo&s;e much of their &s;trength, before they come into u&s;e. So that a material difference will be required in the practice. Another caution that de&s;erves to be attended to, in all countries, is to guard again&s;t the application of cold, dur|ing the operation of high exciting powers. For, when the &s;malle&s;t degree of indirect debility hap|pens to take place, from irregularity in the ap|plication of the&s;e powers, the application of cold, or, to &s;peak more correctly, the &s;ubduction of
<PB N="129" REF="033254_0121_0ff6a7ebb01d71a0">
heat, will increa&s;e the exhau&s;tion, and add to the force of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THE &s;trenuous and authoritative manner, in which this doctrine has always been oppo&s;ed, renders a knowledge of its application to prac|tice difficult to be obtained, even by tho&s;e who thoroughly under&s;tand its principles. The laws of mechanics may be perfectly well under&s;tood. But if a body of artificers, who had from time, immemorial conducted the operative part, in to|tal ignorance of tho&s;e laws, were unanimou&s;ly to declare,
<Q>that the principals might indeed be both ingenious and ju&s;t, for aught they knew, but that they were dangerous in their applica|tion to practice,</Q>
it is certain that the pub|lic would for a time, be deceived by the repre|&s;entations of the&s;e workmen; and the principles of mechanics, however ju&s;t or applicable, could not generally be reduced to practice, until the deception cea&s;ed. Moral truths may be perfect|ly well under&s;tood by a few; but the ignorance, prejudices, and pa&s;&s;ions of a great majority of the human race, will long retard their complete application to practice. Medical truths however have only to combat the prejudices and intere&s;ts of a particular, and but a &s;mall body of men. It may therefore be permitted to hope, that their application to practi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, cannot be much longer delayed.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="033254_0122_0ff6a8e0ae365280">THOSE who have admired, and tho&s;e who have oppo&s;ed the new medical principles, without being ma&s;ters of the &s;ubject, mu&s;t have been equally un&s;ucce&s;sful, in their attempts to apply them to practice. By every &s;ucceeding ca&s;e of failure, the admiration of the one would be di|mini&s;hed, the oppo&s;ition of the other confirm|ed. The objection, therefore, is very ju&s;t, that
<Q>attempts to apply the principles of the Brunonian Doctrine to practice, may be dan|gerous, in ignorant hands.</Q>
In other words, men cannot apply to practice principles, which they do not under&s;tand.&mdash;Let us &s;uppo&s;e a per|&s;on, wholly unacquainted with the <HI>laws</HI> of liv|ing bodies, applying <HI>powers</HI> to them; how can he be expected to produce a <HI>given effect?</HI> Over|looking the immen&s;e variety of degrees, between the &s;tate of health, and the highe&s;t &s;tate of ex|hau&s;tion, he would probably pre&s;cribe one grain of a &s;olid medicine, when he &s;hould have pre|&s;cribed twenty; or twenty, when he &s;hould have pre&s;cribed but one; he would give twenty drops of a fluid, when he &s;hould have given two hun|dred; or two hundred, when he &s;hould have given but twenty. He would repeat the medicine but once or twice in the twenty-four hours, in&s;tead of every hour, or every half hour, according to the duration of its action. He would u&s;e the &s;tronge&s;t powers, in&s;tead of the weake&s;t; and
<PB N="131" REF="033254_0123_0ff6a7f0c2c405e8">
the weake&s;t in&s;tead of the &s;tronge&s;t. He would not make any di&s;tinction between the delicate fe|male, and the robu&s;t male frame; between child|hood and youth, and youth and old age; be|tween recent and long &s;tanding di&s;ea&s;es. He would not even know how to make allowances for inveterate habits. In &s;uch hands, no &s;ucce&s;s could be expected, any more than from a me|chanic, who &s;hould employ equal powers to rai&s;e unequal weights. He might &s;ometimes in|deed be right by chance.</P>
<P>FAR otherwi&s;e is it with him who applies prin|ciples to practice. He calculates, combines, and proportions his powers, according to known laws; and applies them, in &s;uch a manner, as to produce certain and given effects. Nor is the practice of medicine different, in this re&s;pect, from any other art, which is founded upon principle, and re|quires a certain degree of mental exertion.</P>
<P>IN the preceding pages, &s;ome things may ap|pear doubtful, the arrangement occa&s;ionally inac|curate, and the whole requiring illu&s;tration. Was it not even too late, I &s;hould not think my&s;elf at liberty, without the approbation of my ingenious and e&s;teemed friend, Dr. Yates, to make any material alter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters"> in the text. But, in the mean time, it may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> proper to offer &s;uch re|marks, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> by &s;ub&s;equent re|flection,

and may perhaps lead to an arrangement &s;omewhat different, if ever an opportunity &s;hould occur of revi&s;ing the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, di&s;ea&s;es of accumulation, or of direct debility, appear to be even more rare than we have &s;uppo&s;ed them. For if, to a body in a &s;tate of accumulation, the ordinary &s;timuli be applied, a di&s;ea&s;e of exhau&s;tion will immediately en&s;ue. But a body can never long remain in a &s;tate of accumulation, without having the ordi|nary degree of &s;timulant power applied, and &s;ometimes even more. The accumulation, which is produced by the ab&s;traction of heat, food, or the mental pa&s;&s;ions, if it be not immediately re|moved, by the gradual re-application of the&s;e powers, will be converted into a &s;tate of exhau&s;|tion, as &s;oon as the ordinary exciting powers, which &s;upport the healthy &s;tate, are again appli|ed. It is evident, them, that accumulation of the excitability, from the ab&s;traction, or diminution of one or more &s;timuli, mu&s;t &s;oon terminate in the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of health, by the gradual re-application of the&s;e powers, or in the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, of a &s;tate of exhau&s;tion, or of indirect de|bility, by their &s;udden and exce&s;&s;ive re-applica|tion. But it is difficult to &s;uppo&s;e, &s;uch a com|plete ab&s;traction of heat, food or mental &s;timuli, as to occa&s;ion death, without the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tervention of
<PB N="133" REF="033254_0125_0ff6a8e65db22470">
&s;ome &s;timulant power, converting the &s;tate of ac|cumulation into a &s;tate of indirect debility. When food and drink have been long with-held, even a draught of water will exhau&s;t the excitability, and occa&s;ion death. Let us &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on travelling through a &s;andy de&s;art, under the &s;corching rays of a vertical &s;un. If he was pre|viou&s;ly in a &s;tate of accumulation, from the ab|&s;traction of the ordinary &s;timuli, that would im|mediately be converted into a &s;tate of exhau&s;tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This follows as a con&s;equence from Prop. V. I. although not &s;o &s;tated in the text.</NOTE>. And a continuance of the ab&s;traction, would &s;till farther add to the exhau&s;tion, until it terminated in death. When heat has been long ab&s;tracted, and to a con&s;iderable degree, a degree le&s;s than that which con&s;titutes the common temperature, &s;udden|ly applied, will produce mortification, or the death of a part. The ca&s;e of the Roman mother, &s;o aptly quoted by Brown, will exemplify the &s;ame principle, as applied to the mental &s;timuli. The &s;tate of torpor in which &s;ome animals remain, during the winter, and the manner of their re|&s;u&s;citation in the &s;pring, even in a lower degree of temperature than that in which they became torpid, at the &s;ame time that it affords a beauti|ful explication of the principles of this doctrine,
<PB N="134" REF="033254_0126_0ff6a8e979ee6220">
&s;eems to &s;hew, that death does not take place, from the mere ab&s;traction of heat, or from ac|cumulation of the excitability. In this &s;tate of prolonged &s;leep, while re&s;piration is languidly performed, the other functions are dimini&s;hed or entirely &s;u&s;pended. Thus in a two-fold manner, the excitability is accumulated, the &s;u&s;ceptibility of impre&s;&s;ion is proportionally increa&s;ed, and a degree of heat lower than that under which tor|por took place in autumn, will produce healthy excitement in &s;pring<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This idea is, in part, taken from Dr. Girtanner.</NOTE>. It &s;eems very difficult to conceive, how death can ever take place from mere accumulation. For while excitability re|mains, a due application of exciting powers will produce healthy excitement; and when it is ac|cumulated in an unu&s;ual degree, it is only requir|ed that a diminution of exciting powers, propor|tionate to the accumulation, or to the &s;u&s;ceptibi|lity of impre&s;&s;ion, &s;hould be made, in order to produce the highe&s;t excitement. But in every ca&s;e, in which death <HI>&s;eems</HI> to take place from ac|cumulation, it is ea&s;y to conceive, that it <HI>really</HI> happens from exhau&s;tion. For, in the highe&s;t degrees of accumulation, for in&s;tance, when a liv|ing body is nearly frozen, the &s;malle&s;t degree of exciting power, although greatly below the force
<PB N="135" REF="033254_0127_0ff6a8eba655d3d8" MS="y">
of the ordinary &s;timuli applied in a &s;tate of health, will be di&s;proportionate to the &s;u&s;ceptibility of im|pre&s;&s;ion, and will therefore produce a &s;tate of ex|hau&s;tion. And the farther &s;ubduction of heat, will increa&s;e the exhau&s;tion &s;o produced, until it ter|minates in death. Upon the whole, it may, I think, be concluded, that death never takes place directly from accumulation; but always from ex|hau&s;tion of the excitability. The &s;tate of accu|mulation, then, when it does not terminate in health by the gradual re-application of exciting powers, mu&s;t always terminate in a &s;tate of exhau&s;tion, by the application of exciting powers, di&s;propor|tionate to the &s;tate of the excitability. Scurvy therefore, and the other di&s;ea&s;es which have been mentioned as ari&s;ing from the ab&s;traction of &s;ti|muli, would &s;eem to be all di&s;ea&s;es of exhau&s;ti|on or of indirect debility. In proof of this, every ca&s;e, that I have met with at &s;ea, re&s;embling what has been de&s;cribed by authors under the name of &s;curvy, yielded to mercury. It was &s;o certain a cure, that I never thought of u&s;ing any other remedy. Nor did it at all, when properly ex|hibited, increa&s;e the debility of the patient. The rea&s;on why mercury has &s;o often been found inju|rious in &s;curvy, is, that it has &s;eldom been given in a proper manner. The &s;alvation, of which au|thors complain, as being &s;o ea&s;ily excited, would never occur, if it was exhibited in &s;uch a manner,
<PB N="136" REF="033254_0128_0ff6a8f38b8aa2b8">
as regularly to &s;upport the excitement. It is now perfectly known, that this and every other &s;ymp|tom of indirect debility, which &s;ucceed the u&s;e of mercury, ari&s;e from the &s;ubduction, not from the immediate action of that medicine. But where &s;alivation actually takes place, after the applicati- of mercury, or other &s;timulant powers, many facts concur in &s;hewing, that but a &s;mall degree of organic le&s;ion exi&s;ts; and if a patient, in that &s;tate, ever dies, it mu&s;t be from &s;ub&s;equent mi&s;manage|ment. The complaints, therefore, again&s;t mer|cury, in &s;curvy, and other di&s;ea&s;es, are not ju&s;tly to be attributed to the medicine, but to the abu&s;e of it. There does not &s;eem much difficulty in accounting for the bad effects, which have ari&s;en from the abu&s;e of mercury in that di&s;ea&s;e. As the proper principle, upon which that and every other medicine &s;hould be exhibited, as not being under&s;tood, the mode in which it was applied in &s;curvy, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have increa&s;ed the exhau|&s;tion, or converted the original &s;tate of accumu|lation, into a &s;tate of exhau&s;tion; and the vici&s;&s;i|tudes of weather, that u&s;ually occur on board of &s;hips, would increa&s;e &s;till farther the exhau&s;tion. It is in this way, and upon the principles explain|ed in the text, that cold proves &s;o injurious, dur|ing the application of mercury, or other high ex|citing powers, when they are un&s;kilfully exhibit|ed. Scurvy, in fact, appears to be a di&s;ea&s;e mere|ly
<PB N="137" REF="033254_0129_0ff6a8f6ee5b3bb8" MS="y">
general, and in its origin of &s;light degree; at fir&s;t ari&s;ing from the &s;ubduction of nouri&s;hment, and the mental &s;timuli, and afterwards increa&s;ed by an exce&s;&s;ive, or irregular application of other exciting powers, and a continued negation of food &s;ufficiently nouri&s;hing. Accordingly, the gradual re-application of food &s;ufficiently nou|ri&s;hing, and of the mental &s;timuli, is alone, for the mo&s;t part, &s;ufficient to cure the di&s;ea&s;e. It is upon the principle of the gradual re-application of nouri&s;hment, that vegetables have been found at fir&s;t preferable to animal food. And this fact it was, if the above rea&s;oning be right, that led to the error, committed in the text, of con&s;idering &s;curvy as a di&s;ea&s;e of accumulation.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the excitement and excitabili|ty, a more elegant and ju&s;t arrangement of the propo&s;itions might, no doubt, have been made. This defect, however, is not of material import|ance; as the principles of the doctrine are &s;till &s;ufficiently intelligible; and every one, who un|der&s;tands them, as they now are&punc; will be able to judge what they ought to be.</P>
<P>AN early and &s;incere admirer of this doctrine, for who&s;e judgment I entertain a re&s;pect, hav|ing expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome doubts in regard to the non|exi&s;tence of di&s;ea&s;es of exce&s;&s;ive excitement, and reque&s;ted me to re-con&s;ider the &s;ubject, a defer|ence
<PB N="138" REF="033254_0130_0ff6a7f2b8202230">
for his opinion, and a wi&s;h to place the matter in a clearer point of view, induce me to enter upon a detail, which &s;eemed at fir&s;t un|nece&s;&s;ary. As the entire rejection of di&s;ea&s;es of exce&s;&s;ive-excitement, is a great deviation from the original doctrine, and one of very con&s;idera|ble importance in its influence upon practice, I &s;hall endeavour, by &s;tating the grounds of it at &s;ome length, to obviate all rea&s;onable objections to the theory. In this place, it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that medical facts, as they have been called, are too often nothing more than a loo&s;e relation of circum&s;tances. A fact, properly &s;peak|ing, mu&s;t be &s;o evidently true, that every man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ound organs, may di&s;cern it. And the general facts, or principles, which are induc|tions from partiular facts, may al&s;o be di&s;cerned by all men of ordinary capacities, who will take the trouble of going through the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps in rea&s;oning. But where are the facts of this de&s;crip|tion, which prove that &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;e from what has been called, by Brown, a &s;tate of ex|ce&s;&s;ive excitement, and, by others, a &s;tate of plethora? If they can be produced, I will with much readine&s;s acknowledge my error, in having denied the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a &s;tate.

controver&s;y might have been avoided, by attend|ing to accuracy of expre&s;&s;ion, it may not be im|proper to explain the &s;en&s;e, in which the term "exce&s;&s;ive excitement" is here under&s;tood. Excitement is meant to expre&s;s the vigor, with which the functions of life are performed, in all their different degrees. But the functions of life can only be performed in a due, or in a defici|ent degeee. To &s;ay that they can be performed in an <HI>exce&s;&s;ive</HI> degree, is as great a contradicti|on in terms, as <HI>exce&s;&s;ive virtue,</HI> or <HI>exce&s;&s;ive joy</HI>; the one is <HI>vice,</HI> the other <HI>pain.</HI> When &s;timulant powers are applied in due proportion, the ex|citement is at the degree which con&s;titutes vi|gor, tone, or health. But when they are ap|plied, either in a deficient or an exce&s;&s;ive de|gree, the power with which the functions of life are performed, i. e. the <HI>excitement</HI> is dimini&s;hed. That power con&s;i&s;ts in a plea&s;ant, ea&s;y, and ex|act u&s;e of the&s;e functions; which is certain|ly not enjoyed in the di&s;ea&s;es, that have been referred to a &s;tate of exce&s;&s;ive excitement. When a degree of &s;timulant power, higher than is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the &s;tate of health, is applied, the func|tions of life will be performed with more than u|&s;ual vigor, before they fall into a &s;tate of indirect debility; but never with <HI>exce&s;&s;ive</HI> vigor. The <HI>action</HI> of the fibre may be exce&s;&s;ive, but its <HI>power</HI> cannot.&mdash;If we trace the progre&s;s of the living

functions, in a per&s;on expo&s;ed to the action of high &s;timulant powers, it will be found, that their vigor is fir&s;t increa&s;ed to the highe&s;t point, and afterwards dimini&s;hed in a degree proporti|onate to the exce&s;s. But if the&s;e powers be gradually &s;ubducted, that diminution will not take place; or if they be re-applied, it will be removed; unle&s;s the exce&s;s has been &s;uch as to occa&s;ion the de&s;truction of organs. It will not, I believe, be denied, that the headach, &s;ickne&s;s, &amp;c. which ari&s;e after exce&s;&s;ive drinking, con&s;ti|tute a &s;tate of indirect debility, which might have been prevented by the gradual &s;ubduction, and is to be removed by the re-application of &s;timu|lant powers. That a certain quantity of &s;pirits, a ride, &amp;c. will remove the&s;e &s;ymptoms, is a fact that is known, almo&s;t to every one. After exce&s;&s;ive walking, or dancing, that &s;tate of in|direct debility con&s;tituting fatigue, is not imme|diately induced. It becomes more &s;evere the &s;econd and third day, unle&s;s, by a certain degree of walking, or dancing, or the &s;ub&s;titution of other &s;timuli, in the intermediate time, it be prevented.

None of the&s;e &s;ymptoms occur, during the action of the exciting powers; they always commence after the&s;e powers have been with|drawn. If this be denied, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, that medicines lie dormant in the body for &s;ome hours, after having been taken; and then, all at once, begin to act. But headach does not in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly follow the application of &s;pirituous liquors; delirium, or fever, the application of opium, or the &s;olar rays; vomiting, the application of tartar emetic; &s;alivation, the u&s;e of mercury; purging, the exhibition of cathartics; &s;weat, of &s;udorifics; nor ve&s;ication, the application of a bli&s;ter, or of &s;ire, to the &s;kin.&mdash;On the contra|ry, the&s;e &s;ymptoms always appear &s;omtime after the application of the exciting powers; and may be prevented by a gradual reduction, or cured by a judicious re-application of the &s;ame powers, or

of others equivalent in force; excepting, indeed, when the force of the noxious power has been &s;o great, as to produce an immediate le&s;ion of or|gans. Let us take a familiar ca&s;e, as an exam|ple. Suppo&s;e an arm, or a leg has been expo&s;ed to the action of fire, no per&s;on, in his right &s;en|&s;es, would think of plunging it into cold water, or &s;now, or applying ice. It is a fact well known, that ardent &s;pirits, vinegar, and other &s;timuli of high degree, are the proper remedies; and that, if applied in due time, and in &s;ufficient quantity, they will prevent the inflammation, ve&s;ication, pain, and fever that would otherwi&s;e en&s;ue. If the principle be e&s;tabli&s;hed, in one ca&s;e of exce&s;|&s;ive application of &s;timuli, it mu&s;t equally apply to all. Every fact concurs in proving, that the bad &s;ymptoms which ari&s;e after an exce&s;&s;ive application of the &s;timulant powers already men|tioned, or of others, depend upon a &s;tate of in|direct debility, <HI>not</HI> upon &s;uch a &s;tate as that of exce&s;&s;ive excitement; and that they are to be prevented or removed by the proper application, <HI>not</HI> by the &s;ubduction of &s;timulant powers.</P>
<P>IF, to a per&s;on in health, a very high degree of heat has been applied, as in expo&s;ure to the rays of a burning &s;un, would it not be as danger|ous to remove him &s;uddenly into a cool, or even a temperate atmo&s;phere, as it would, in the ca&s;e
<PB N="143" REF="033254_0135_0ff6a908b16bee88">
of a per&s;on, who had been expo&s;ed to a high de|gree of cold. In the one ca&s;e the fact is uni|ver&s;ally admitted, and the principle applied to practice: Why not in the other? Is it more difficult to comprehend that, after an application of extraordinary &s;timuli, a &s;udden &s;ubduction of them &s;hould produce indirect debility, than that the &s;ame effect &s;hould follow a &s;udden re-applica|tion of the ordinary &s;timuli, after they have been for any time withheld?&mdash;Upon principles equally clear, the excitability in the one ca&s;e, would not be accumulated; in the other, it would be exhau&s;|ted. Hence it is evident, why ca&s;es of <HI>coup de &s;oleil</HI> are &s;o frequently fatal. I &s;hould think my|&s;elf acting with equal propriety, in &s;uddenly &s;ubducting, not only the high &s;timulant power of the &s;olar rays, after having been for &s;ome time applied, (at lea&s;t without &s;ub&s;tituting ano|ther &s;timulus nearly as powerful, and then gra|dually reducing it) but farther taking away a quantity of blood, and dimini&s;hing all the ordi|nary &s;timuli, as in plunging legs nearly frozen into hot water, giving a pound of meat to one who had been long fa&s;ting, and farther apply|ing, to per&s;ons, in the&s;e &s;tates, opium, aether, or brandy. It is much to be regretted that, in this, as well as in many other ca&s;es, practitioners who are not them&s;elves convinced of the efficacy of blood-letting, &s;hould think it incumbent up|on
<PB N="144" REF="033254_0136_0ff6a90ad15c2720">
them, from a fal&s;e de&s;ire of reputation, or a regard to intere&s;t, to put it &s;o frequently in practice. It is very true, that a conformity with the common practice is &s;afe&s;t in a prudential view. For, if a patient dies of peripneumony, without the formalities of bleeding and purging, he will be &s;aid to have lo&s;t his life, in con&s;equence of the&s;e omi&s;&s;ions. But if he dies, after they have been duly performed, it is only from the nece&s;&s;ity of his fate.</P>
<P>PERIPNEUMONY, in reality, is &s;eldom a dan|gerous di&s;ea&s;e, until, by blood-letting and other debilitating means, inflammation and adhe&s;ion of membranes, &s;uppuration, and drop&s;y are pro|duced.&mdash;Has a per&s;on ever died in a &s;tate of ex|ce&s;&s;ive vigour? No, nor ever will. No danger, then, need be apprehended from &s;uch a &s;tate.</P>
<P>IF it be a certain fact that opium, judiciou&s;ly repeated, will prevent or cure tho&s;e very &s;ymp|toms, which an un&s;kilful application of it may have produced; if, by the proper exhibition of mercury, that medicine may be given, not only without producing &s;alivation, but &s;o as to cure it; if the &s;ickne&s;s and headachs that occur, after exce&s;&s;ive drinking, may not only be preven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by a gradual diminution of the exce&s;s, but may be cured by the application of a certain degree of the &s;ame power. If, I &s;ay, all the&s;e be facts (and
<PB N="145" REF="033254_0137_0ff6a9102c250a68">
they will be found &s;o by tho&s;e who will give them a fair trial) the inevitable conclu&s;ion is, that all the di&s;ea&s;es in que&s;tion, depend upon a &s;tate of exhau&s;tion or of indirect debility, and are to be cured, by the application of &s;timulant powers, in a degree proportionate to the exhau&s;tion.</P>
<P>FROM the general ignorance and neglect of this doctrine, the be&s;t adapted of the&s;e powers, to particular ca&s;es and degrees of di&s;ea&s;e, have not yet been well a&s;certained. But in proporti|on as it is more generally received, phy&s;icians, in&s;tead of random empirical pre&s;criptions, will apply powers to living bodies, according to known principles, and with a view to particu|lar effects. They will con&s;ider the living body as a whole, upon the &s;tate of which depends that of every particular part; and they will de|&s;i&s;t from the hopele&s;s ta&s;k of pre&s;cribing for &s;trangling &s;ymptoms. They will co-operate in di&s;covering the relative powers, the duration of their action, and the be&s;t method of exhibiting, every &s;ub&s;tance that can be employed in medi|cine. While, in di&s;ea&s;es of the highe&s;t degree, they will all probably employ the mo&s;t diffu&s;ible &s;timuli, as opium, aether, camphor, volatile al|kali, mercury, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The powers of ar&s;enic and other &s;ub&s;tances called poi&s;ons, are by no means well a&s;certained.

may with advantage give a preference to his fa|vourite medicine. And if he applies it, &s;o as to &s;upport the excitement, health will be re-produc|ed, whether he u&s;es bark, or wine, &s;alts, aloes, or gamboge; ca&s;tor oil, rhubarb, or cream of tartar.</P>
<P>NOTHING perhaps has contributed more to increa&s;e the confu&s;ion in medical doctrines, than the inaccurate language and loo&s;e rea&s;oning, with which the cultivators of the art have found it nece&s;&s;ary to veil the ab&s;urdities of their &s;y&s;|tems. The divi&s;ion of cau&s;es into proximate and remote, is a remarkable in&s;tance of this. It &s;hews evidently that, in medical rea&s;oning, POWER has uniformly been confounded with CAUSE. Many powers may combine to produce one effect; but it is not any one of the&s;e powers, but the &s;um of the whole, that con&s;titutes the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of that <HI>effect.</HI> Thus, exce&s;&s;ive heat,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is always to be under&s;tood, that exce&s;&s;ive heat, or other &s;timuli applied in exce&s;s, relates to the &s;tate of the ex|citability, not to any particular &s;tandard of heat, or any degree of other &s;timulant powers.</NOTE> fa|tigue, bad news, noxious air, may all combine to produce a &s;tate of indirect debility. The cau&s;e of this &s;tate of indirect debility, is <HI>not</HI> exce&s;&s;ive heat, fatigue, bad news, or noxious air; <HI>but</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="033254_0139_0ff6a9159931dc10">
the &s;um of all the&s;e powers. Again, indirect debility, in its various degrees, is the cau&s;e of all tho&s;e &s;ymptoms which con&s;titute di&s;ea&s;es, depending upon that &s;tate, each of which has, in no&s;ological &s;y&s;tems, obtained a particular name. But, as there can be nothing intermedi|ate between a cau&s;e and its effect, and as there can only be required one cau&s;e to produce one effect, <HI>remote cau&s;e</HI> is evidently a gro&s;s contra|diction in terms. To &s;ay that any of the powers, the application of which will produce a &s;tate of indirect debility, is a <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of &s;ymptoms, which are <HI>con&s;equences</HI> of that &s;tate, appears to me as great a perver&s;ion of rea&s;oning, as it would be to affirm, that a man dies <HI>becau&s;e</HI> he has been begotten. The one event undoubtedly precedes the other; but they are not in the relation of cau&s;e and effect, as the&s;e terms are generally un|der&s;tood.</P>
<P>ANOTHER circum&s;tance, which has contri|buted to prolong the public delu&s;ion, in re&s;pect to the uncertainty of medical principles is this. THEORY and HYPOTHESIS, I hope and believe more through ignorance than de&s;ign, have been very generally confounded under the common name of OPINION; as if it were impo&s;&s;ible, that principles &s;hould exi&s;t, becau&s;e they have not been di&s;covered by &s;y&s;tem makers; that, as all
<PB N="148" REF="033254_0140_0ff6a80f012fb9e8">
medical &s;y&s;tems which have hitherto been framed are erroneous, there cannot be a true one in na|ture; or that man alone is that curious compo&s;i|tion, that "fortuitous concour&s;e of atoms," which nature, in a frolick&s;ome mood, had ex|empted from the operation of laws, fixed, im|mutable, eternal.&mdash;It will be difficult, without the aid of in&s;piration, to reconcile a&s;&s;ertions of &s;ucce&s;sful practice, with a confe&s;&s;ion that it is founded upon conjecture. It will be equally dif|ficult to account, with decency, for an oppo|&s;ition to a doctrine, of which the fundamental propo&s;itions are either &s;elf-evident facts, or in|ductions from numerous facts; of which every propo&s;ition has an evident relation to every other, and the whole to every part. It might rather be &s;uppo&s;ed that the contention would be, who &s;hould apply the principles mo&s;t correctly to practice.</P>
<P>TO the ridiculous and vague objections, found|ed on the alledged danger of giving large do&s;es of medicines, the following remarks, it is pre|&s;umed, will be a &s;ufficient reply. From the principles of the foregoing doctrine, it re&s;ults that, in every di&s;ea&s;e, a &s;um of &s;timulant power equal, or nearly equal, to that which has pro|duced the di&s;ea&s;e, mu&s;t be applied, in order to effect a cure. It is only when the &s;um of the
<PB N="149" REF="033254_0141_0ff6a91837059a10">
powers &s;o applied exceed that, which has produc|ed the di&s;ea&s;e, that the medicines can do harm. In that ca&s;e, and in that ca&s;e only, they will produce a di&s;ea&s;e more dangerous, becau&s;e high|er in degree, than that which had previou&s;ly ex|i&s;ted. Hence it appears that, while in di&s;ea&s;es of the highe&s;t degree, as plague, dy&s;entery, and fevers, more e&s;pecially in tho&s;e ca&s;es in which organic le&s;ion has taken place, the common do&s;|es of medicines is merely &s;porting with lives, in di&s;ea&s;es, deviating but little from health, they, for the mo&s;t part, exceed the ju&s;t proportion. While, in &s;ome ca&s;es of the former, from four to five hundred drops of tincture of opium will be too little, in &s;ome ca&s;es of the latter, the u&s;u|al quantity of from twenty to thirty drops, will be too much. Indeed in ca&s;es, deviating but lit|tle from health, tho&s;e high &s;timulant powers are unnece&s;&s;ary, and ought not to be u&s;ed. The&s;e conclu&s;ions will appear &s;o evident, to all who under&s;tand the principles of the new doctrine, that it would be &s;uperfluous, and might &s;eem im|pertinent, to dwell longer on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>IN like manner, it is evident whence the di&s;putes, which have ari&s;en among phy&s;icians, re&s;pecting the virtues of particular medicines, have derived their &s;ource. From want of ju&s;t principles as a guide, the &s;ame power which proved u&s;eful

in the hands of one man, from a particular mode of application, has been found injurious by o|thers, from a different mode of exhibiting it. Hence the virtues of the peruvian bark, &s;ince its fir&s;t di&s;covery, have been extravagantly ex|tolled, and as unrea&s;onably decried. Hence hemlock, which was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully u&s;ed by the judicious Dr. Stork, entirely failed with other practitioners, and unju&s;tly lo&s;t its reputatation. Hence electricity, which, applied according to principle, I will venture to affirm, will be found a power of &s;uperior efficacy in the cure of di&s;ea&s;|es, has been greatly neglected; and when &s;uc|ce&s;sful, has only been &s;o by chance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have &s;ome opinions regarding electricity, as applied to living bodies, which I &s;hall take an early opportunity of verifying, or di&s;proving by experiment.

<P>ONE of the mo&s;t egregious mi&s;takes which has been made, re&s;pecting the doctrine of life, re|mains &s;till to be mentioned. It has been under|&s;tood, or rather mi&s;under&s;tood, to con&s;i&s;t entire|ly in the exhibition of opium, brandy, and wine,
<PB N="151" REF="033254_0143_0ff6a9216498aed0">
in every ca&s;e, and with no di&s;crimination&punc; To tho&s;e who know it better, it mu&s;t appear evident, that the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances have no more relation to the principles of the doctrine, than any other pow|ers, that may be applied to the excitability. The free u&s;e of them, in a &s;tate of health, is even contrary to principle. But the laws of nature, as they re&s;pect living bodies, would &s;eem, in the ordinary routine of cu&s;tom, to have been nearly rever&s;ed. In a &s;tate of health, for the mo&s;t part, too great a &s;um of &s;timulant power is applied; in a &s;tate of di&s;ea&s;e, generally too little. Suppo&s;e opium, brandy, and wine annihilated, the doctrine would remain entire. Provided the excitement be &s;upported, it matters not by what powers it is done. It is evident, then, that tho&s;e, who have re&s;ted their oppo&s;ition upon objections to any particu|lar medicine, or the do&s;es of medicines, could not have under&s;tood the &s;ubject. Indeed to un|der&s;tand is to believe in it. As &s;oon will eyes, in a &s;ound &s;tate, be unable to di&s;tingui&s;h light from darkne&s;s, as a mind capable of comprehend|ing the terms, can di&s;believe the fundametal pro|po&s;itions of the doctrine of life. If this be true, can it be denied, that the doctrine has, by all its opponents, been either prejudged or mi&s;|under&s;tood?</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="033254_0144_0ff6a9248637e758">THIS is not a que&s;tion of party; but a conte&s;t between truth and error. It is not the judgment, dignity, or character of this or that individual, that is in di&s;pute; but the truth or fal&s;hood of a doctrine, who&s;e principles embrace every part of animated nature. Whether di&s;coveries have been made by a man named Brown, or a man named Cullen; whether they have i&s;&s;ued from the ob&s;curity of a cottage, or the elevated de&s;k of a profe&s;&s;or, is of little con&s;equence to the world.

<HEAD>A TREATISE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN enquiring into the action of mercu|ry upon living bodies, no attempt will be made to inve&s;tigate its <HI>modus operandi,</HI> of which we are totally ignorant. It is the effects, whether &s;alutary or noxious, that &s;ucceed the application of that power to living bodies, which will form the &s;ubject of con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>WHATEVER be the mode in which mercury acts, like every &s;ub&s;tance in nature, it can pro|duce no other effect upon living bodies, than to increa&s;e or dimini&s;h the power, with which they perform their proper functions;&mdash;in other words, to increa&s;e or dimini&s;h their excitement. All the &s;ub&s;tances in nature, which are capable, when applied to living bodies, of increa&s;ing or dimini&s;h|ing their excitement, are denominated &s;timulant or exciting powers. Should it, then, appear
<PB N="156" REF="033254_0148_0ff6a9332f82f6c0">
that mercury will increa&s;e or dimini&s;h the excite|ment,&mdash;that it will both produce and cure di&s;ea&s;|es of indirect debility,&mdash;may we not, nay, mu&s;t we not conclude that it is a &s;timulant or exciting power?</P>
<P>THIS theory I had adopted in 1789; &s;ince which period, I have applied it to practice, in ma|ny ca&s;es, and with con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s. The fir&s;t trial was made upon my&s;elf. In January, 1789, on the pa&s;&s;age from Bengal to England, having been &s;eized with a quotidian intermittent fever, tartar emetic, and afterwards bark, with now and then a cathartic medicine, were, as u&s;ual, exhibited. Under this mode of treatment, I daily became weaker, and in the cour&s;e of three weeks, during which the &s;ame plan was per&s;i&s;ted in, my legs became aedematous, the paroxy&s;ms of fever more &s;evere, and I could, with difficulty ri&s;e out of bed.</P>
<P>THE <HI>evacuant</HI> and <HI>anti&s;eptic</HI> plans were now entirely abandoned; and between two and three drachms of mercurial ointment, were rubbed up|on my body, at bed time. The alteration, which this &s;ingle rubbing produced, was equally unex|pected and &s;alutary. I &s;lept the whole night; and in the morning, awoke in a gentle per&s;pirati|on, without fever, or pain, any di&s;agreeable &s;ymptoms, excepting aedema and general debility,

remaining. The ointment was rubbed in, three or four times; and I had no return of fever. My mouth was not affected; and I &s;peedily got well. The i&s;&s;ue of this experiment made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, and determined me, in future, to u&s;e mercury, in every ca&s;e of inter|mittent fever. Having obtained a &s;light know|ledge of the Brunonian doctrine, I thought my|&s;elf in the &s;tate of the benighted traveller, to whom Brown, with &s;o much ju&s;tice and elegance, compared him&s;elf, upon the fir&s;t di&s;covery of his doctrine. ***

I inferred that mercury, in common with <HI>many</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>All,</HI> according to the pre&s;ent ideas.</NOTE> other medicines, was a &s;timulant power; and would, therefore, be u&s;eful in all di&s;ea&s;es of indirect debility.

One of the fir&s;t in&s;tances, in which an opportunity of trying the practice in other

During my re&s;idence there, an European book-keeper upon the plantation, by name&mdash;Macmillan, was &s;eiz|ed with typhus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve that no&s;ological di&s;tinc|tions are totally di&s;regarded, as incompatible with the princi|ples of the new doctrine.

When I fir&s;t &s;aw him, he was comato&s;e and picking the bed cloathes; he had got &s;ome purges, and had been taking bark. His pul&s;e was quick and &s;mall; his tongue black and furred; and he was &s;uppo&s;ed beyond the po&s;&s;ibi|bility of recovery. I repre&s;ented to Dr. Maclean the good effects produced by mercury, in other ca&s;es of fever, and reque&s;ted that he would permit it to be tried in this; to which, with a liberality, not always to be met with from e&s;tabli&s;hed practitioners, he readily con&s;ented<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This gentleman had been a practitioner of reputation. But had then retired from the exerci&s;e of his profe&s;&s;ion, and re&s;ided on his e&s;tate.</NOTE>. About an ounce of &s;trong mercurial ointment was immediatly rubbed on the patient's body.
<PB N="159" REF="033254_0151_0ff6a93d61b55d30">
But, as in typhus, this was a new experiment, I did not choo&s;e wholly to tru&s;t to the mercury; and therefore de&s;ired that he might be allowed a wine gla&s;sful of Madeira every hour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is but a &s;mall quantity of wine in typhus fever.&mdash; In &s;ome ca&s;es it may be nece&s;&s;ary to give three or four bottles, in the twenty-four hours.

<P>THE next day he was &s;till in&s;en&s;ible; but &s;at up in bed, and &s;earched, as it were in&s;tinctively, for the Madeira bottle. When it was given him, he would not con&s;ent to part with it; but held it firm, between both hands, as if &s;omething, upon which depended his exi&s;tence. The oint|ment was again rubbed in, by gue&s;s, twice in the day,&mdash;the quantity about half an ounce each time; and the wine was continued. He was perceptibly getting better. The &s;ame treat|ment was per&s;evered in; and at the end of five days, from the commencement of it, he walked in the verandah, in a &s;tate of convale&s;cence. It was &s;ometime, however, before he entirely lo&s;t the fatuitous look, which has been noticed as a &s;yptom of yellow fever. His face was a little &s;welled, and his gums &s;lightly affected by the mercury. During convale&s;cence, he took wine and bark freely.</P>

<P><Q>MERCURY is univer&s;ally allowed to cure lues venerea. All writers on hepatitis concur, in ex|tolling its virtues in that di&s;ea&s;e.

by mercury; and hence, the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es have, in my opinion, very erroneou&s;ly been &s;uppo&s;ed venereal.</Q></P>
<P>THIS conclu&s;ion, which is certainly not ju&s;t, mu&s;t have been productive of the mo&s;t di&s;agreea|ble con&s;equences. The very idea would &s;everely wound the feelings of delicate and mode&s;t females; among whom di&s;ea&s;es, from the tran&s;plantation of teeth, have mo&s;t frequently ari&s;en.

<P>THE following ca&s;e, extracted from the &s;ame journal, is the in&s;tance alluded to of gout and bleeding di&s;charges, being cured by mercury.</P>
<P><Q>MRS. E&mdash; B&mdash;, of King&s;ton, Jamaica, aged forty years, had been accu&s;tomed to live freely, and was &s;ubject to frequent attacks of gout. Having been occa&s;ionally at her hou&s;e, &s;he &s;ometimes a&s;ked my advice. In the cour&s;e of a &s;hort &s;pace of time (for &s;he was &s;ubject
<PB N="163" REF="033254_0155_0ff6a94b88224a68">
to frequent paroxy&s;ms) &s;he was cured of two attacks of gout, by mercury, opium, and the warm bath; but mercury was the principal power applied. On the 8th of Augu&s;t, 1790, &s;he complained of an ince&s;&s;ant men&s;trual di&s;|charge, alternating with a di&s;charge of blood from the piles. The&s;e &s;ymptoms &s;he &s;aid had commenced &s;even weeks before, occa&s;ioned, as &s;he thought, by fear; and, for &s;ome days, had been accompanied with headach, pain of back, loins, and other feveri&s;h &s;en&s;ations.&mdash; Her &s;tomach was very irritable, and could bear nothing liquid in the morning, excepting wa|ter, accidulated with elixir of vitriol, or ginger tea. She had a trouble&s;ome cough, and pain in her &s;ide, which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from the affection of the liver. This idea &s;he was rather encouraged to entertain, that an op|portunity might be got of trying the effects of mercury, in bleeding di&s;charges. Two drachms of mercurial ointment were rubbed on her body in the evening, and &s;he was de|&s;ired to take a draught, with forty drops of tincture of opium, every four hours, through the night. Her legs were immer&s;ed in warm water. She was advi&s;ed to take &s;olid food only; and to u&s;e for drink, water &s;trongly accidulated with elixir of vitriol, or ginger tea. Augu&s;t the 9th, the ointment and lau|danum
<PB N="164" REF="033254_0156_0ff6a972d4439388">
had been u&s;ed as directed. She had no fever; her headach was le&s;s &s;evere; and &s;he per&s;pired freely. The men&s;es cea&s;ed to flow, and di&s;charge commenced from the piles. She was &s;till encouraged to believe that her liver was affected; and the medicines were ordered to be continued. Augu&s;t the 10th, &s;he was in all re&s;pects better. The di&s;charge from the piles was con&s;iderably le&s;s.&mdash;One drachm of ointment only was rubbed in, and the tincture of opium was omitted. 11th, the ointment was once more rubbed in. The di&s;|charge from the piles entirely cea&s;ed; and &s;he had no return of any of her &s;ymptoms.</Q></P>
<P>THOSE who are inclined to que&s;tion the effi|cacy of mercury, in di&s;ea&s;es of indirect debility, may object that, as other powers were, in this ca&s;e, combined with it, the cure cannot fairly be attributed to the mercury alone. That is very true. All the other powers performed their re|&s;pective parts. But, from a thou&s;and analogies, I think it may be affirmed, that mercury alone would have been &s;ufficient. In general, when &s;everal powers can be applied to different parts of the body, either in concour&s;e or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;o as to &s;upport the excitement regularly, and with equality, it is much better to have recour&s;e to many, than to tru&s;t entirely to one.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="033254_0157_0ff6aa069c749f48">THE effects of mercury, in fevers and other di&s;ea&s;es of indirect debility, were mentioned in conver&s;ation with medical men, in many parts of the I&s;land of Jamaica; mo&s;t of which I vi&s;ited in 1789-90. The idea, as u&s;ually happens, was endeavoured to be ridiculed, and the facts to be di&s;credited.

In all the ca&s;es (not le&s;s than ten or twelve) in which the experiment was fairly made, I have not known it to fail once, where the mercurial ointment was u&s;ed in &s;uch quantity as to affect the mouth. The &s;orene&s;s of the mouth, &s;eems to be a &s;ign, that the &s;y&s;tem is &s;ufficient|ly excited, to overcome di&s;ea&s;es of debility<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This is incorrect.

As it was not &s;uppo&s;ed to act in any <HI>&s;pecific</HI> manner, its operation was &s;upported by opium, camphor, wine, bark, the warm bath, and bli&s;ters, according to circum&s;tances.

<P>ALTHOUGH it is rather deviating from the &s;ubject, it is worth while to pau&s;e a moment in admiration of the rule of practice, founded upon this fact. Fir&s;t, to draw blood, to have after|wards the plea&s;ure of introducing more opium, or mercury into the &s;y&s;tem, than could other|wi&s;e have been done; to debilitate, in order to &s;trengthen; to accommodate the patient's habit to the quantity of medicine that is to be given, rather than proportion the quantity of medicine to the &s;tate of the patient; the&s;e are rules &s;o wonderfully &s;ublime, that they can never be &s;ufficiently admired! If it were permitted, upon &s;uch &s;ubjects, to rea&s;on in a plain way, I would a&s;k, if a patient's excitement be five degrees be|low the healthy &s;tandard, how can any rational being think of lowering it five degrees more,

that he may afterwards rai&s;e it, with the greater &s;afety? He will then require to apply double the force, that would at fir&s;t have been &s;ufficient. The Journal goes on to ob&s;erve, that
<Q>mercury affects the mouth much &s;ooner, when opium, bli&s;ters, the warm bath, or any other of the more powerful &s;timuli are u&s;ed at the &s;ame time. In the ca&s;e of Willian Kirk, the addi|tional &s;timulus of the warm bath &s;peedily ac|compli&s;hed what opium, mercury, and wine did not effect for a fortnight.</Q></P>
<P>THIS patient had the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of chro|nic diarrhoea, with a con&s;iderable degree of hec|tic fever, emaciation, and entire lo&s;s of appe|tite. Externally he u&s;ed mercury, and internally opium and wine, according to circum&s;tances. It was found nece&s;&s;ary to alternate the&s;e &s;timuli with others, &s;uch as bli&s;ters and the warm bath. He u&s;ed to remain a quarter of an hour in the bath, heated to as great a degree as he could ea&s;ily bear. It was not tried, until after he had been a fortnight u&s;ing mercury. After having u&s;ed it twice, his mouth became &s;ore. There was an increa&s;ed flow of &s;aliva, and he recovered in a very &s;hort &s;pace of time, to the great &s;ur|pri&s;e of all who &s;aw him; and, I confe&s;s, contrary to my own expectations. It now, however, ap|pears, as a ca&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e, by no means danger|ous, if treated in a manner, but di&s;tantly ap|proaching

to the exactne&s;s of &s;cientific princi|ples. The following remarks are in pro&s;ecution of the &s;ame &s;ubject:&mdash;
<Q>In June, 1791, we had from thirty to forty &s;oldiers, ill of fevers, catarrhs, and rheumati&s;ms, and many more with various trifling ailments&punc; who&s;e ca&s;es were not entered in the Journal. The &s;imilarity of their di&s;ea&s;es and treatment, rendered it unnece&s;&s;ary to record any, excepting the mo&s;t dangerous. In every ca&s;e in which mercury was given, &s;o as to produce &s;alivation, the pul&s;e ro&s;e, and all complaints gave way, as &s;oon as the mouth was thoroughly affected. But in &s;ome ca&s;es, that was found very diffi|cult to accompli&s;h; and in others, I was afraid, although perhaps without ju&s;t grounds, to pu&s;h the medicine to a great extent, particularly in diarrhoea and dy&s;entery.</Q></P>
<P>THIS groundle&s;s apprehen&s;ion, aro&s;e from a knowledge of the purging effects that &s;ucceeded the u&s;e of calomel, and other mercurial prepa|rations; and from erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ing that a medicine, which, exhibited in one way, produ|ces purging, cannot, if exhibited in another way, cure di&s;ea&s;es, of which purging is the principal &s;ymptom. But farther reflection and experi|ence, &s;oon bani&s;hed this remnant of &s;chola&s;tic prejudice.</P>

<Q>In every ca&s;e of low fever, which occurred among the &s;oldiers, on the pa&s;&s;age to India, from the mo|ment the mouth was effected<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By affection of the mouth, is meant an increa&s;ed flow of &s;aliva.

In tho&s;e ca&s;es, many facts au|thori&s;e the conclu&s;ion, that no recovery will take place.

But as the mercury was u&s;ed externally only; and as, in &s;ome ca&s;es, the mouth could not, in that manner, be affected (which ca&s;es never terminated favourably) might not the internal u&s;e of that medicine prove more effectual?

<P>From that period, my confidence in the pow|ers of mercury, for the cure of all di&s;ea&s;es of in|direct debility, became &s;o decided, that I determi|ned to apply it in every ca&s;e, in which the ideas of my patients would admit of the practice,&mdash;even in diarrhoeas, and dy&s;entery, the di&s;ea&s;es in which the theory &s;eemed mo&s;t difficult of reconciliation. With re&s;pect to the di&s;ea&s;es that were con&s;idered as depending upon a &s;tate of exce&s;&s;ive excitement, although I much doubted the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a &s;tate, yet my ideas were by no means &s;ufficiently clear in regard to it. An opportunity having &s;oon occurred of putting it to the te&s;t of expe|riment, in my own per&s;on, it was eagerly em|braced. In September, 1793, after having been expo&s;ed a whole day to the heat of the &s;un, in an open boat, upon the river Hooghly, I was &s;eized, in the evening, with &s;ymptoms of high fever. According to the common practice, I &s;hould immediately have lo&s;t blood, taken an emetic, or purgative, and ab&s;tracted as far as

po&s;&s;ible, all the u&s;ual and ordinary &s;timuli. In&s;tead of that, a pill, con&s;i&s;ting of one grain of opium and one grain of calomel, was taken every hour, through the night. By this means, the excitement was &s;ufficiently &s;upported, and I remained ea&s;y, with an abatement of all the fe|brile &s;ymptoms. On the following morning, a con&s;iderable &s;tiffne&s;s, &s;welling, and pain, affected my left arm, from the &s;houlder downwards; and it had a&s;&s;umed a kind of livid appearance, rather alarming. This arm, from the &s;ituation in which I &s;tood in the boat, had been more expo&s;ed to the direct rays of the &s;un, than any other part of my body. It was bathed with tincture of opi|um, and rubbed with mercurial ointment alter|nately; and the pills were continued. After having taken about thirty pills, my arm began to return to its u&s;ual &s;tate, and all the other &s;ymptoms di&s;appeared. The pills were omitted; and I found my&s;elf quite well.&mdash;From eight to twelve hours, however, after the pills were omitted, my mouth, all at once, became very &s;ore. A di&s;charge of blood from the fauces and gums &s;oon commenced, which continued trou|ble&s;ome for two days, and ended in &s;alivation. Had I then adverted to the fact, that a &s;ore mouth and &s;alivation are not produced by a re|gular exhibition of mercury, but by the irregular exhibition, or &s;udden &s;ubduction of it, the&s;e

trouble&s;ome and di&s;agreeable &s;ymptoms might ea&s;ily have been avoided; or if, by neglect, they had been allowed to occur, they might as readi|ly have been cured. The fever did not return; and I was &s;oon re&s;tored to health. This fever, after a bleeding or two, would mo&s;t probably have a&s;&s;umed the appearance of peripneumony, which, according to the medical hypothe&s;es of the &s;chools, would have indicated &s;till farther bleeding, and other evacuations. And there is little doubt that, under &s;uch treatment, it would have terminated, at the be&s;t, as &s;o many ca&s;es of acute di&s;ea&s;es do, in this country,&mdash;in adhe|&s;ions of membranes, local affections of the vi&s;|cera, or a very lingering recovery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In con&s;equence of a conver&s;ation that took place, after writing this treati&s;e, the following note, extracted from the 9th vol. of the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries, was &s;ent me,

This mo&s;t excellent practice was, in all probability, oppo&s;ed at the time, in order to &s;upport &s;ome ri|diculous hypothe&s;es of the Schools.</NOTE>. But let me not be mi&s;under&s;tood. It is the bleeding alone which I condemn in &s;o unqualified a man|ner. The cathartics, &s;udorifics, &amp;c. employed

in the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, although by no means given with the proper view, and therefore &s;eldom giv|en in a proper manner, are, upon the whole, productive of more good than harm. Their ef|fect is always to increa&s;e excitement, and the &s;tate of indirect debility, which &s;ucceeds their operation, con&s;tituting purging, &s;weating, &amp;c. ari&s;es from their not being repeated afterwards in &s;uch a regular manner, as to produce the highe&s;t excitement.</P>
<P>SOON after this period, an opportunity occurr|ed of giving mercury a very fair trial, in diarr|hoea and dy&s;entery, almo&s;t the only di&s;ea&s;es in which I had not yet ventured to apply it. Ear|ly in the year 1794, I was on board the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India Company's &s;hip Houghton, compo&s;ing part of a &s;quadron on a cruize again&s;t the French, and de&s;igned for the protection of Batavia. The crew of the Houghton, in con&s;equence of the &s;hip's having been ill manned, &s;ome peculiarities in the internal oeconomy, and having been &s;tati|oned, at the port of Batavia, a month longer than the other &s;hips, &s;uffered much from &s;ick|ne&s;s. A very great proportion of the &s;eamen were &s;eized with diarrhoeas, fevers, and dy&s;en|teries, the &s;evere&s;t that I had ever &s;een. The European &s;oldiers and la&s;cars<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We had on board a company of European infantry, and a company of gun la&s;cars, from Bengal.</NOTE>, being &s;ubject to

different regulations, enjoyed a tolerable exemp|tion from di&s;ea&s;e. Upon this occa&s;ion, the in|efficacy of the treatment, recommended by au|thors and teachers, in &s;evere ca&s;es of dy&s;entery, &s;truck me in the mo&s;t forcible manner. The u&s;ual do&s;es of medicines produced no percepti|ble effect. In this dilemma, it was determined, as had been &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed upon other oc|ca&s;ions,
<Q>to u&s;e opium, camphor, mercury and other &s;timuli, both internally, and externally, until the di&s;ea&s;e was cured, or a &s;alivation pro|duced. In every ca&s;e, in which the mouth was affected, a recovery with certainty en&s;ued<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But in tho&s;e ca&s;es, in which the mouth could not be affected, &s;o as to produce an increa&s;ed flow of Saliva, not one recovered. This remark was omitted in the journal, having been &s;uppo&s;ed to follow as a nece&s;&s;ary conclu&s;ion from the other. But as, upon a more attentive con&s;ideration, that does not appear to be the ca&s;e, it is proper that both circum|&s;tances &s;hould be explicitly &s;tated. I was &s;ometimes deceiv|ed by an appearance of &s;orene&s;s of the mouth, and left off the medicine prematurely.</NOTE>. Bli&s;ters and wine were u&s;ed, with great ad|vantage, as auxiliaries</Q>.
The&s;e remarks are taken, with &s;ome trifling alteration in the lan|guage, from a copy of the Medical Journal, kept on board the Houghton, in 1793 and 1794<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">THE Journal it&s;elf ought to have been d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;ited, as u&s;ual, at the India Hou&s;e. But I am informed, that it has either been mi&s;laid, or, for private rea&s;ons, wilfully &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, by the commander of the Houghton, on his pa&s;&s;age to Europe. A copy of the remarks, however, has been forwarded to the Court of Directors.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="033254_0168_0ff6a950e17ce810">THUS it appears, that the efficacy of mercury has been experienced in almo&s;t every di&s;ea&s;e of in|direct debility. In the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, and in America, it has been found a cure for the yel|low fever of the&s;e climates. But it has not been exhibited with the view, or in the manner, in which alone it can produce the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible effects, viz. &s;o as to &s;upport the excitement. Dr. Chi&s;h|olm, indeed, has approached the neare&s;t to the proper mode of exhibiting this medicine, without however &s;eeming to under&s;tand the principles. It is more &s;urpri&s;ing that Dr. Ru&s;h, who appears to under&s;tand the fundamental principles of the doc|trine of life, &s;hould not have applied them, in the treatment of the yellow fever of Philadelphia. His attributing the cure to the purging operation, which &s;ucceeds the u&s;e of calomel, &s;hews how dif|ficult it is to era&s;e early impre&s;&s;ions, however erro|neous, even from the mo&s;t vigorous mind.</P>
<P>IF opium, wine, and bark failed in ca&s;es of yel|low fever oftener than mercury, as is &s;aid to have happened at Philadelphia, it mu&s;t have ari&s;en from the former having been exhibited in deficient quantities, while the latter was given more freely.
<PB N="177" REF="033254_0169_0ff6a978e14c8170">
It will often happen that the prejudices of practi|tioners, as well as of the multitude, will render the choice of one medicine more eligible than that of another, when there is no difference in other re|&s;pects. The circum&s;tance of calomel being &s;uc|ceeded by purging led, by chance, to a proper practice. But I cannot admit, with Dr. Ru&s;h, that it was "the triumph of a medical princi|ple." The di&s;ea&s;e would have been cured by any mode of treatment capable of &s;upporting the ex|citement, in &s;uch a manner as to admit of an ac|cumulation of the excitability.</P>
<P>THAT the opinion is erroneous, needs no other proof than this fact, that, in all di&s;ea&s;es, a cure will be better effected, when the medicine is re|peated at &s;uch intervals, as not to produce purg|ing; but to &s;upport the excitement in a regular manner. A cure will al&s;o be performed, by the external application of mercurial ointment, with|out producing purging, as well as by the internal exhibition of calomel. Neither is &s;alivation, &s;weat|ing, or an increa&s;ed di&s;charge of urine, nece&s;&s;ary to the cure. On the contrary, the&s;e &s;ymptoms, all of which in their different degrees depend up|on a &s;tate of indirect debility, &s;hould, as far as po&s;|&s;ible, be prevented. Salivation is, no doubt, an unequivocal proof of the original di&s;ea&s;e having been removed; for, being it&s;elf a di&s;ea&s;e of indi|rect

debility, occa&s;ioned by the &s;udden &s;ubduction of mercury, or its repetition at improper intervals, it cannot co-exi&s;t with any other di&s;ea&s;e. Al|though, therefore, in di&s;ea&s;es of very high degree, &s;alivation is &s;o far a de&s;irable &s;ymptom; yet as the di&s;ea&s;e, if not incurable, may be cured with|out it, it ought as far as practicable, to be avoid|ed. There are however, two conditions nece&s;&s;ary to this. The fir&s;t is, that the practitioner &s;hould know the principles, and the manner in which they are to be applied to practice: the &s;econd, that the patient &s;hould conform exactly to his directions. When the&s;e circum&s;tances happily concur, accor|ding to any facts that are yet known, there is not a &s;ingle di&s;ea&s;e of indirect debility, in which an organic le&s;ion has not taken place, that may not be cured, without producing either purging, or &s;alivation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two ingenious papers, on the u&s;e of nitric acid in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, were, &s;ome time ago, publi&s;hed at Bombay, &s;aid to be written by Dr. Scot, of that place. Upon peru|&s;ing them, I was led to in&s;titute &s;ome experiments with that medicine. For rea&s;ons unnece&s;&s;ary to mention, they were not completed. But there were &s;ufficient grounds to infer, that Dr. Scot's &s;tatement of its effects was faithful, and not over|charged. In chronic ca&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e, of every kind, it pro|duced good effects; and, in &s;everal ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, after the nitric acid was laid a&s;ide, a very &s;mall quantity of calomel was &s;ucceeded by &s;alivation. The inference is obvious. It produced an ef|fect upon the mouth, &s;imilar to that which ari&s;es from mer|cury; and, if a con&s;iderable degree of &s;alivation &s;eldom en|&s;ued, in the ca&s;es in which I tried it, that probably aro&s;e from its not having been given in &s;ufficient quantity.&mdash;The ingenious author of the papers alluded to, it is hoped, will find lei&s;ure to trace the analogy, between mercury and nitric acid, more in detail; and to give his ideas to the public in a le&s;s peri&s;hable &s;hape, than a news-paper e&s;&s;ay. The di&s;covery is the more entitled to our re&s;pect, as it was the re&s;ult of rea|&s;oning, not of accident. Perhaps the large quantity of fluid, nece&s;&s;ary to dilute the acid, may be an objection, where the le&s;s bulky preparations of mercury can be u&s;ed with more convenience. But it will often be found a plea&s;ant drink: and may, with advantage, be alternated with the preparations of mercury. I u&s;ually began by giving from &s;ixty to a hun|dred and twenty drops, of highly concentrated acid, in a quart of water, in the 24 hours.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>I. THAT mercury applied to living bodies, in due proportion, will increa&s;e the excitement, and thereby cure di&s;ea&s;es of indirect debility, in their various degrees.</P>
<P>II. THAT, applied in an exce&s;&s;ive degree, or in an irregular manner, it will induce a &s;tate of in|direct debility, in its various degrees.</P>
<P>III. THAT this &s;tate is indicated by ulcerations of the throat, &s;orene&s;s of the mouth, &s;alivation, purging, &s;weat, an increa&s;ed flow of urine, &s;ome|times &s;trangury, and co&s;tivene&s;s, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IV. THAT in the exhibition of mercury for the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, all the&s;e &s;ymptoms &s;hould, as far as po&s;&s;ible, be avoided.</P>
<P>V. BUT as in di&s;ea&s;es of high degree, in which large quantities of mercury are required, it will for the mo&s;t part be difficult, and often imprac|ticable

to conform to pre&s;criptions, with the nece&s;&s;ary exactne&s;s;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If in the application of mercury, the judgment of the phy&s;ician, and the punctuality of the patient, &s;hould even co|operate in en&s;uring a perfect conformity to principle; the intervals of &s;leep will often be &s;ufficiently long to occa&s;ion a &s;ore mouth, an increa&s;ed flow of &s;aliva, griping, purging, or any of the other &s;ymptoms of indirect debility. Few pa|tients, under a cour&s;e of mercury, according to the u&s;ual mode of exhibiting it, entirely e&s;cape the&s;e &s;ymptoms.

<P>VI. THAT the duration of the action of each do&s;e of mercury, upon the living body, appears to be not le&s;s than one or more than two hours. This, however, is not con&s;idered as a point yet e&s;tab|li&s;hed, with &s;ufficient preci&s;ion.</P>

IN all the ca&s;es, which, under the&s;e circum|&s;tances, terminated fatally, exten&s;ive local di&s;|ea&s;e of the abdominal or thoracic vi&s;cera, or both, was found upon di&s;&s;ection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">IN a word, infinitely the wor&s;t in the Calcutta General Ho&s;pital, and perhaps in all India, I opened, during the mo&s;t unhealthy months of the year, the body of every patient that died under my charge. The appearances were recorded on the books of the Ho&s;pital. In every ca&s;e, there was an exten&s;ive le&s;ion of &s;ome of the primary organs. Several li|vers weighed each between five and &s;ix pounds, and one near|ly eight. Some of them contained above a pint of thick pus; and that which weighed near eight pounds, contained above a quart. In &s;ome ca&s;es, cartilaginous, in others boney &s;ub&s;tances, were found in livers, in which there were no traces of recent &s;uppuration. They &s;eemed to be concretions form|ed from purulent matter. There were generally, in the&s;e ca&s;es, ulcerations of the coecum, colon, and rectum. In one ca&s;e of fever, the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;pleen was quite di&s;&s;olved. It had the appearance of dark coloured mud, without a &s;ingle trace of a blood ve&s;&s;el remaining. The mo&s;t urgent &s;ymptom, in that ca&s;e, was a raging thir&s;t. The treatment, in every in&s;tance of di&s;ea&s;e of high exhau&s;tion, was conducted on the &s;ame plan that was pur&s;ued in the foregoing ca&s;es. And I have the &s;atisfaction to &s;ay, that I did not lo&s;e a &s;ingle patient, who came under my charge in the incipient &s;tage of di&s;ea&s;e. But as it is not my de&s;ign to &s;et my own judgment in com|petition with that of any other per&s;on, I will only affirm, that the practice re&s;ulting from the principles of the new doc|trine, was in general infinitely more &s;ucce&s;sful, than the com|mon mode of practice, in like ca&s;es, has ever been in my own hands. That of Dr. Yates, and Mr. Brydie, founded upon the &s;ame principles, was attended with undeniable &s;ucce&s;s.</NOTE>.</P>

XV. FROM all the&s;e facts I conclude, that le&s;ion of particular organs, &s;uch as to render them unfit for the performance of their proper functions, is the &s;tate which con&s;titutes an incurable di&s;ea&s;e,

when the foregoing principles are &s;kilfully ap|plied.</P>
<P>XVI. TO what degree a le&s;ion of organs, of primary importance to life, may take place con&s;i&s;tently with the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of health, is a point that is by no means a&s;certained.

<P>THE pro&s;ecution of this &s;ubject, conducted up|on the principles which have now been explained, may be attended with important advantages to the practice of medicine; and it is hoped will not be neglected by tho&s;e, who wi&s;h to exerci&s;e their in|tellectual powers upon &s;ubjects of real importance.</P>

<HEAD>DISSERTATION ON THE SOURCE OF EPIDEMIC AND PESTILENTIAL DISEASES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN endeavouring to promote knowledge, it may &s;ometimes be as u&s;eful to correct ancient errors as to promulgate new di&s;coveries. In medicine, doctrines of the greate&s;t importance have been handed down from generation to generation, which altho' demon&s;trably fal&s;e, have never once been called in que&s;tion. The &s;uppo&s;ed exi&s;t|ence of contagion in plague, dy&s;entery, and fe|vers, appears to me, to be a very remark|able in&s;tance of this propen&s;ity in man, to pur&s;ue the beaten tract, however unprofitable or un&s;afe. Is not this conduct often the effect of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, choo&s;ing to avoid the re&s;pon&s;ibility of innova|tion?
<PB N="190" REF="033254_0181_0ff6a9a337be2058">
And is it not for the &s;ame rea&s;on, that erroneous doctrines generally remain longer undi&s;proved, in proportion to the extent of their influence upon practi&s;e? However that may be, it is certain that contagious matter has, in all ages, been con&s;idered, by the multitude, as the cau&s;e of plague, dy&s;entery, and fevers,&mdash;by far the mo&s;t de&s;tructive di&s;ea&s;es that affect the human race.

<P>PLAGUE, dy&s;entery, and fevers, then, as they are not &s;ubject to the &s;ame law, would, if they were contagious, never di&s;appear.

ill of typhus, dy&s;entery, or fever, is &s;eized with the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. So far from infection being invariably communicated in this manner, no in|&s;tance of it has ever been di&s;tinctly traced. If &s;uch ca&s;es had ever been recorded, we mu&s;t either reject them as fal&s;e, or abandon one of the funda|mental axioms of philo&s;phy. For, whatever has happened once, mu&s;t happen often; it mu&s;t hap|pen always, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances. But in the &s;ituations alluded to, the&s;e circum&s;tances con|&s;tantly occur, and the alledged effects do not fol|low. It is not fair to conclude, that dy&s;entery is contagious, becau&s;e one per&s;on happens to be tak|en ill, while in the neighbourhood of another, who has got the di&s;ea&s;e. If the conclu&s;ion was ju&s;t, all within the infectious di&s;tance, not labour|ing under a di&s;ea&s;e higher in degree, would be &s;imilarly affected.

It would proceed in a geometrical ratio, diverg|ing from the centre, to every point of the circum|ference, of a city, a camp, an ho&s;pital, or a &s;hip. It is evident then, that in the&s;e &s;ituations, a con|tagion, which and the power of producing its pe|culiar diea&s;e, in the &s;ame per&s;on, more than once during life, would never di&s;appear.

They cea&s;e too when they are epidemic, according to &s;ome peri|odical law, which evinces that they do not ari&s;e from any ca&s;ual and uncertain &s;ource, like the accidental application of contagious matter.</P>
<P>THE ab&s;urdity of the conclu&s;ions which re&s;ult from admitting contagious matter to be the cau&s;e of epidemic and pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es could not have been overlooked till now, if the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a &s;ource had not been &s;o implicitly taken for granted, that even to call in que&s;tion the truth of it, mu&s;t, to many, have the appearance of &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive &s;ceptici&s;m. But I &s;hall endeavour to deduce my conclu&s;ions, from &s;uch numerous and un|doubted facts, as ought, perhaps, to exempt me from that imputation.</P>
<P>DURING the prevalence of epidemic and pe&s;ti|lential di&s;ea&s;es, it is well known, that nur&s;es, and other attendants upon the &s;ick, are not more liable to be affected than other people, who un|dergo an equal degree of fatigue. It may per|haps, be &s;aid, that they become habituated to the contagion. But how do they e&s;cape the fir&s;t ap|plication of it? They have not then got the ha|bit. No per&s;on of that de&s;cription caught the in|fection from tho&s;e who died, of what was called the jail fever at the black a&s;&s;izes at Oxford; a

ca&s;e of alledged contagion &s;o generally known, and &s;o frequently quoted by authors. That the power, which occa&s;ioned di&s;ea&s;e at the Oxford a&s;&s;izes, was not contagious matter, is proved by its producing diarhoea in &s;ome, while it produced fevers in others. And further, no per&s;on was &s;eized, who had not been directly expo&s;ed to the influence of the noxious air. Specific contagion, I conceive, cannot produce a di&s;ea&s;e le&s;s uniform in its appearance, than &s;mall-pox and meazles. But every epidemic and pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e, which has hitherto been reputed contagious, a&s;&s;umes &s;uch various and di&s;&s;imilar appearances, in differ|ent per&s;ons, that they cannot be the effect of any power, equal and uniform in its operation. The &s;ymptoms are not, in any two per&s;ons, exactly alike. Hence the difference of opinion among the phy&s;icians of Philadelphia, during their late epidemic; &s;ome a&s;&s;erting that every di&s;ea&s;e had re&s;olved it&s;elf into yellow fever, while others, cer|tainly with more rea&s;on, affirmed that the di&s;ea&s;es of the city, were various. No epidemic can become &s;o general, as to &s;uppre&s;s all other di&s;ea&s;es; becau&s;e all men, labouring under di&s;|ea&s;es of lower degree, are not expo&s;ed to the powers which produce an epidemic.

<P>ANOTHER fact worthy of notice is, that aged per&s;ons and children, are both &s;eldomer and le&s;s &s;everely attacked by epidemic and pe&s;tilential di&s;|ea&s;es, than the young and middle aged; and women &s;eldomer and le&s;s &s;everely than men.

But it does not appear that Dr. Ru&s;h, in his attempts to trace the origin of the contagion, was more &s;ucce&s;sful
<PB N="206" REF="033254_0197_0ff6a9d313b12b10">
than the college. He &s;uppo&s;ed it to ari&s;e from putrid, vegetable exhalation, produced by a heap of damaged coffee, lying on a wharf. But the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e was not traced, with any certainty, to that focus. It is evident, indeed, from Dr. Ru&s;h's own account, that the inhabit|ants of other &s;treets had been as early and as ge|nerally affected, as tho&s;e of the &s;treets in the im|mediate neighbourhood of the coffee.</P>
<P>IN this, and every other ca&s;e of epidemic and pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e, the exi&s;tence of contagion would &s;eem to have been uniformly taken for granted, not only without examination, but even contrary to the evidence of numerous facts&mdash;a conduct certainly not le&s;s unphilo&s;ophical in me|dicine, than in any other department of &s;cience.</P>

This is ob&s;erved to happen, in tho&s;e months mo&s;t remarkable for heat, calm weather,

In Europe, A&s;ia, Africa and America, from July to October, with little variation, includes the mo&s;t unhealthy portion of the year. In &s;ome places indeed, as Aleppo, that happens from April to July; but always with a certain regula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ty, coinciding with periodical &s;tates of the weather. The di&s;ea&s;es which anunally ari&s;e from this &s;ource, are not always general or &s;evere.

<P>FROM every record of epidemic and pe&s;tilenti|al di&s;ea&s;es, it would appear, that they have their &s;tated periods of recurrence; that the&s;e periods are &s;uch months, as are mo&s;t remarkable for vi|ci&s;&s;itudes of the atmo&s;phere; that they become general, only in years in which the&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes are exteme; that they do not occur in &s;ea&s;ons when the degrees of heat or cold, however in|ten&s;e, are equable; nor in years when the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere remains tempered throughout; and that they uniformly cea&s;e, with the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of an equable &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, whether the weather be hot or cold.</P>

But why &s;hould we he&s;itate to be|lieve, that the &s;ame general cau&s;es which produc|ed unu&s;ual vici&s;&s;itudes of the atmo&s;phere, in the one country, &s;hould extend their influence to the other? In the &s;ame year, and the &s;ame &s;ea|&s;on, the Engli&s;h &s;ettlers, on the coa&s;t of Africa, were &s;iezed with a fever, which proved fatal to a great number of them.

And hence the contagion was &s;uppo&s;ed, by Dr. Chi&s;holm and others, to have been im|ported in that &s;hip. Was it nece&s;&s;ary, it might ea&s;ily be &s;hewn, that the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions were adopted upon very &s;light grounds. But if the ex|i&s;tence of contagion can be di&s;proved upon gene|ral

grounds, it would be &s;uperfluous to inve&s;ti|gate every particular circum&s;tance in its favour, that may have been ha&s;tily a&s;&s;umed as a fact.</P>
<P>IN Aleppo, according to Dr. Ru&s;&s;ell, the European inhabitants regularly &s;hut them&s;elves up, in their hou&s;es, every year, at &s;ome period between April and July. And the rich natives begin to adopt the &s;ame plan, as far as their cu&s;|toms will permit them to do, without &s;candal. From this fact, it appears that the plague occurs at Aleppo, in a &s;tate le&s;s or more mild, almo&s;t annually, and <HI>that it commences and cea&s;es at cer|tain known periods.</HI> But it has been remarked there that, in its mo&s;t &s;evere &s;tate, this di&s;|ea&s;e recurs only at periods of ten years, or there-abouts&mdash;a regularity, which cannot, upon any known principle, be attributed to a power of &s;uch ca&s;ual application, as contagious matter.</P>
<P>It has farther been ob&s;erved of the plague, that
<Q>the winter puts an end to it at Con&s;tanti|nople; the &s;ummer de&s;troys it in Egypt.</Q>
In fact, what epedemic or pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e has been known to occur with &s;everity at the&s;e peri|ods of the year? But, in order to account for this, will it be &s;aid, that contagion is de&s;troyed, both by heat and by cold? The a&s;&s;ertion would certainly be ab&s;urd. Be&s;ides the fact can be muhc better explained. At the&s;e periods, the body is
<PB N="210" REF="033254_0201_0ff6a9dfc5d702a8">
not &s;o liable to di&s;ea&s;e, becau&s;e it is not expo&s;ed to the effects of heat and cold, dryne&s;s and moi&s;ture, tempe&s;tuous and calm weather, &s;uddenly and frequently alternated. The&s;e vi|ci&s;&s;itudes are mo&s;t remarkable in &s;pring and autumn, which accordingly are the &s;ea|&s;ons, mo&s;t fertile of di&s;ea&s;es, in all parts of the globe. It is a curious circum&s;tance, and much to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that the belief of the Turks in the contagious nature of the plague, has con&s;iderably increa&s;ed, &s;ince their communi|cation with Europeans has become more extend|ed. Formerly there was no want of &s;ervants, or relations, to undertake every nece&s;&s;ary office about the &s;ick, the &s;ame as in any common di&s;|temper; but now, it is difficult to procure even mercenary attendants. "I have met," &s;ays Dr. Ru&s;&s;ell, &s;peaking of the plague at Aleppo in 1760,
<Q>with &s;everal in&s;tances, even in Turki&s;h hou&s;es, where the mi&s;tre&s;s of the family was not only ill attended, but even abandoned through the timidity of her daughters and &s;laves. I apprehend the dread of contagion gains ground among the Mahommedans, in all parts of Syria, where the Europeans have much commerce.</Q>
Mahommed, having pro|bably perceived the bad con&s;equences that would re&s;ult from &s;uch a dread, condemned the belief of di&s;ea&s;es being &s;pread by contagion, as <HI>impious.</HI> And this at lea&s;t &s;hews, that the plague has not
<PB N="211" REF="033254_0202_0ff6a9e39abcf498">
always been &s;uppo&s;ed, by the Turks, to ari&s;e from contagion; or if it has, that the belief was deemed injurious. With the example of Europe|an credulity before them, the modern followers of Mahommed may, in no long time, put more faith in contagion, than in this law of their pro|phet. But in &s;uch a renunciation of faith, e|ven a Chri&s;tian will have little cau&s;e to rejoice. If it &s;hould appear to be only a &s;ub&s;titution of one error for another, Europeans will not have much rea&s;on to ridicule the former &s;tupidity of the Turks; nor to boa&s;t of their own &s;uperior penetration, in intoducing among them a belief in the contagious nature of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>PHYSICIANS, having ob&s;erved the dependence of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es upon the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, their uniform appearance under &s;ome &s;tates, and ce&s;&s;ation under others, could not well reconcile the&s;e facts with the hypothe&s;is of contagion. But a reconciliation was, at all events, determined upon. The &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere was made to act upon the matter of contagion, in &s;uch a man|ner as to explain every phoenomenon. Is the weather hot, when an epidemic commences, heat gives activity to contagion; is it cold, cold is favourable to contagion; is it dry, the contagion is concentrated; is it wet, diluted: even vici&s;&s;i|tudes &s;et it in motion. But &s;hould the epidemic
<PB N="212" REF="033254_0203_0ff6a9e7915cc360">
happen to cea&s;e, during any of the&s;e &s;tates of the atmo&s;phere, this may with equal facility be ac|counted for, by a&s;&s;igning to the <HI>&s;ame</HI> powers, as has frequently been done in medical rea&s;oning, <HI>different</HI> or even <HI>oppo&s;ite</HI> modes of operation. Let the exi&s;tence of contagion be once admitted as a fact, and there is nothing more ea&s;y than to trace its orign to &s;ome ideal &s;ource. The mo&s;t obvious, and therefore the mo&s;t frequently in&s;i&s;ted upon, is contact with &s;ome per&s;on, ill of the &s;ame di&s;|ea&s;e. But as the per&s;on, who happens to be fir&s;t &s;eized, could not have received the infection in that manner, it was found nece&s;&s;ary to refer it to various &s;ources. Even with tho&s;e advantages, however, it was often difficult, and exerci&s;ed the ingenuity of the learned, to di&s;cover the origin of particular epidemics. The imputed &s;ources of tho&s;e calamities became at length &s;o numerous, that it requires little labour to trace the origin of all di&s;|ea&s;es to &s;ome one, or other of them. If, for in|&s;tance, it cannot be traced to actual contact, it will probubly be di&s;covered, that the patient has, at &s;ome recent period, been expo&s;ed to the effluvia of rotten hemp, flax, coffee, cabbage, onions, black pepper, or potatoes; for all of the&s;e pow|ers have been &s;aid to produce epidemics. But in years, when the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are &s;o highly pe&s;ti|lential,
<PB N="213" REF="033254_0204_0ff6a9e9cd6a3828">
that the effluvia, ari&s;ing from a heap of rotten vegetables, might &s;eem too trifling a pow|er to produce &s;uch important effects, recour&s;e may &s;till be had to the importation of contagious matter, in bales of goods from the Mediterra|nean; or, with the ingenious Gibbon, to the gene|ration of it, by &s;warms of putrid locu&s;ts, in Egypt. The&s;e hypothe&s;es, were they not &s;upported by the authority of celebrated names, are almo&s;t too ri|diculous for refutation. That a parcel of rotten vegetables &s;hould produce a di&s;ea&s;e, that is con|tagious, and capable of producing de&s;olation and death, over a populous city&punc; ought not certainly to be credited without proof; and with re&s;pect to proof, it does not appear that there is any, excepting that, during the prevalance of epide|mics, vegetables have become putrid. Was pu|trid vegetable exhalation ever the cau&s;e of a con|tagious di&s;ea&s;e, it would &s;pread in an evident and regular progre&s;&s;ion, affecting fir&s;t tho&s;e who are neare&s;t to its &s;ource. There could be no po&s;&s;ibitity of mi&s;taking or overlooking the cau&s;e. But as no &s;uch progre&s;s has ever been a&s;certained, and as it might have ea&s;ily been traced, had there been any truth in the opinion, it is every way in|con&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;t rea&s;oning to admit, that pu|trid vegetable exhalation can be the cau&s;e of con|tagion.&mdash;I mean not to deny, that putrid vegeta|ble exhalation may produce di&s;ea&s;e, but the di&s;ea&s;e
<PB N="214" REF="033254_0205_0ff6a9eb95456388">
will be contagious. There cannot be a doubt that putrid vegetable exhalation is a power, ca|pable of producing di&s;ea&s;e, in its immediate neighbourhood; but it is equally certain, that it never can occa&s;ion an epidemic or pi&s;tilential di&s;|ea&s;e, over a whole country, or city. The pu|tridity of vegetables, and the epidemic di&s;ea&s;es of animals, are probably occa&s;ioned by the &s;ame power, viz. a certain &s;tate or certain vici&s;&s;itudes of the atmo&s;phere. That kind of weather or that di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;urrounding elements, which occa&s;ions an uncommon mortality among animals and vegetables, will al&s;o produce an uncommon degree of putrefaction, among the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, their dead &s;tate.</P>
<P>COULD the hi&s;tory of all epidemic and pe&s;tilen|tial di&s;ea&s;es of animals be minutely traced, I am-well convinced it would be found that they have uniformly been attended with corre&s;pondent di&s;|ea&s;es of vegetables, in that particular part of a country, to which they have been confined. For, as all living bodies are &s;ubject to the &s;ame laws,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide prop. I. View of the Science of Life.</NOTE> it is evident that any power, which can produce general di&s;ea&s;e in animals, will have the &s;ame ef|fect upon that portion of vegetable &s;ub&s;tances to which it is applied; and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> Accordingly tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es of indirect debility of vegetables,

known to farmers by the terms <HI>ru&s;t</HI> and <HI>bla&s;t,</HI> have ofte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> been ob&s;erved to occur, at the &s;ame time with epidemic di&s;ea&s;es among animals. And the rea|&s;on why &s;uch a coincidence has not always been expre&s;sly noticed, is probably, that the &s;ubject has not been con&s;idered in this point of view. If &s;uch a coincidence then &s;hould be found invariably true, will it be &s;aid that contagion may be communi|cated from animals to vegetables, and from vege|tables to animals?</P>
<P>WHEN particular di&s;tricts of a country, whole nations, or con&s;iderable portions of a continent, are &s;uffering from a &s;carcity of grain, will it be &s;aid that the di&s;ea&s;e of vegetables, which is the cau&s;e of the &s;carcity, was produced, not by the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, but by contagion? In this ca&s;e, how is the contagious matter to be traced? Is it wafted, as it were by a magic influence, from field to field,&mdash;over mountains, rivers, lakes, and oceans? The infectious di&s;tance would, in that ca&s;e, be wide indeed! But I apprehend it will &s;carcely be contended, that the epidemic di&s;ea&s;es of vegetables are contagious. And in regard to animals, the opinion does not appear at all more probable; excepting from the &s;ingle circum&s;tance of their not being rooted to the &s;oil. Would it not be more rational to admit, that the di&s;ea&s;es, in both ca&s;es, as produced by the operation of &s;ome &s;uch general power as the &s;tates or vici&s;&s;i|tudes
<PB N="216" REF="033254_0207_0ff6a9f458bdbd80">
of the atmo&s;phere, to the influence of which animals and vegetables are equally expo&s;ed?</P>
<P>OF the numerous facts, by which this propo&s;i|tion is &s;upported, it will &s;uffice to quote a few. As Dr. Ru&s;h's account of the yellow fever of Phila|delphia is, perhaps, the be&s;t hi&s;tory that has been given of any epidemic, it may be often with pro|priety referred to. There was &s;omething in the "heat and drought of the &s;ummer months," (1793)
<Q>which was uncommon, in their influ|ence upon the human body. Labourers every where gave out, (to u&s;e the common phra&s;e) in harve&s;t, and frequently too when the mercury in Farenheit's Thermometer was under 84*** **. The crops of grain and gra&s;s were impair|ed by the droughts.</Q></P>
<P>IT appears, from &s;everal ob&s;ervations, that there was, that year, an uncommon calmne&s;s of the weather.</P>
<P><Q>IN the year 1762, the billious yellow fever prevailed in Philadelphia, after a very hot &s;um|mer, and &s;pread like a plague, carrying off dai|ly, for &s;ome time, upwards of twenty per&s;ons.</Q>
Can it be doubted, that the&s;e &s;tates of the weath|er will produce di&s;ea&s;e, both among animals and vegetables? And if the operation of &s;uch an obvi|ous power, be adequate to explain the phoenome|na
<PB N="217" REF="033254_0208_0ff6aa18958d1700">
of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, what need is there of adopting an ideal one, like contagious matter, to account for them?</P>
<P>MR. Potter, in a letter to Dr. Ru&s;h, dated from Caroline, county Maryland, 1&s;t November, 1793, &s;ays,
<Q>it is an invariable maxim here, both among phy&s;icians and farmers, that, if the wheat be damaged by ru&s;t or bla&s;t, a contagious dy&s;en|tery is &s;oon to follow.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 181.</NOTE></P>
<P>PREVIOUS to the occurrence of every epidemic, &s;omething unu&s;ual, in the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, has always been remarked. A yellow fever ap|peared at Cadiz, after a hot and dry &s;ummer in 1764; and at Pen&s;acola, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, in 1765. Was the contagion traced, in this ca&s;e, from Cadiz to Pen&s;acola, by a direct or circuit|ous channel, or was it traced at all?&mdash;That the yellow fever of Philadelphia, in 1793, depended upon the &s;tates or vici&s;&s;itudes of the atmo&s;phere, evidently appears from the following ob&s;ervations, communicated to Dr. Ru&s;h, by a gentleman, who re&s;ided occa&s;ionally in &s;outhern and tropical coun|tries. He informed him, that he had ob&s;erved, in
<Q>the month of July, &s;everal weeks before the yellow fever became general, a peculiar and
<PB N="218" REF="033254_0209_0ff6a9f68966ff68">
univer&s;al &s;allowne&s;s of complexion, in the faces of the citizens of Philadelphia, &s;uch as he had ob&s;erved to precede the prevalence of malignant bilious fevers, in hot climates.</Q>
Dr. Dick had
<Q>ob&s;erved the &s;ame appearance in the faces of people in Alexandria, accompanied in &s;ome ca|&s;es, by a yellowne&s;s in the eyes, during the la&s;t &s;ummer,</Q>
(1793)
<Q>and &s;ome time before vio|lent, bilious fevers became epidemic, upon the banks of the Potowmac.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Ru&s;h, page 183.</NOTE> A change &s;o gradu|al and general in the appearance, both of animals and vegetables, can never be explained by admit|ting contagion, but is ea&s;ily and &s;atisfactorily ac|counted for, by &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;tates or vici&s;&s;itudes of the atmo&s;phere to have been the noxious pow|er.
<Q>It appears farther, from the regi&s;ter of the weather, that there was no rain between the 25th of Augu&s;t, and the 15th of October, ex|cept a few drops, hardly enough to lay the du&s;t of the &s;treets, on the 9th of September, and the 12th of October. In con&s;equence of this drought, the &s;prings and wells failed in many parts of the country. The du&s;t, in &s;ome places, extended two feet above the &s;urface of the ground. The pa&s;tures were deficient or burnt up. There was a &s;carcity of autumnal fruits in the neighbourhood of the city. But while veg|etation
<PB N="219" REF="033254_0210_0ff6aa1b0c72e7a8">
drooped or died from the want of moi&s;|ture in &s;ome places, it revived with preterna|tural vigour, from unu&s;ual heat, in others. Cherry trees blo&s;&s;omed, and apple, pear, and plumb trees bore young fruit, in &s;everal gar|dens in Trenton, thirty miles from Philadel|phia, in the month of October.</Q></P>
<P><Q>HOWEVER unoffen&s;ive uniform heat, when agitated by gentle breezes, may be; there is, I believe, no record of a dry, warm, and &s;tag|nating air, having exi&s;ted for any length of time, without producing di&s;ea&s;es. Hippocrates in de&s;cribing a pe&s;tilential fever, &s;ays, the year in which it prevailed, was without a breeze of wind. The &s;ame &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, for &s;ix weeks, is mentioned in many of the hi&s;tories of the plague, which prevailed in London, in 1665.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ru&s;h, pages 109&mdash;110.</NOTE></P>
<P>THUS all the facts &s;tated by Dr. Ru&s;h, and many of his ob&s;ervations prove, that the yellow fever of Philadelphia, in common with other epi|demics, was produced by the &s;tates or vici&s;&s;itudes of the atmo&s;phere, and not by contagious matter, imported, or generated in the city.</P>
<P>PESTILENTIAL di&s;ea&s;es are neither &s;o frequent nor &s;o fatal in modern, as they were in ancient
<PB N="220" REF="033254_0211_0ff6a9f8b99691a8">
times. Cities are now more commodiou&s;ly built; the mode of living is improved; and every circum&s;tance that can contribute to the pre|&s;ervation of health better under&s;tood. Is it not from the&s;e changes, in the &s;tate of &s;ociety, that London, Paris, Madrid, Li&s;bon, and Mar&s;eilles are now much le&s;s &s;ubject to epidemic di&s;ea&s;es than formerly? And in the progre&s;s of improvement, may not the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es entirely di&s;appear? The inhabitants of Grand Cairo, according to Mr. Savary, are heaped together by thou&s;ands. Two hundred citizens there occupy le&s;s &s;pace than thirty at Paris. Thirty citizens at Paris occupy le&s;s &s;pace than ten citizens of London. Twenty citizens of Grand Cairo, therefore occupy le&s;s &s;pace than one citizen of London. The manner in which the citizens of Grand Cairo are thus crouded together, would alone &s;eem &s;ufficient, in a &s;tagnant &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, to produce pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es of the highe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>THE large commercial cities, which have been mo&s;t frequently ravaged by the plague, are for the convenience of &s;ea ports, built in low and unhealthy &s;ituations. Their &s;treets have gene|rally been irregular, crouded, and dirty. In the&s;e cities, therefore, pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es always commence. This circum&s;tance, together with that effect of &s;elf-love, which prevents us from di&s;co|vering the origin of any evil with our&s;elves, pro|bably
<PB N="221" REF="033254_0212_0ff6a95ee4d18598">
gave ri&s;e to the idea, that contagion was imported in bales of goods, or even in parcels of old clothes, from di&s;tant countries. The Epide|mic of a &s;ea&s;on, appearing generally in &s;everal places at a time, by enabling the inhabitants of one place to trace it to another, has al&s;o &s;erved to &s;trengthen the &s;ame opinion. But may not &s;imi|lar &s;tates of the atmo&s;phere occur in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, in Egypt and in Syria, in Dama&s;cus and in Aleppo, in Grand Cairo and in Mar&s;eilles, in Smyrna and in London, in the We&s;t India I&s;lands and in America? And will not the&s;e &s;i|milar &s;tates produce pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es of a &s;i|milar appearance? The plague, indeed, will ne|ver appear with &s;imilar &s;ymptoms in London and in Con&s;tantinople, becau&s;e the &s;tates or vici&s;&s;i|tudes of the atmo&s;phere, in the&s;e two places, can never be exactly alike. But if it depended upon a power, like &s;pecific contagion, which mu&s;t be the &s;ame in all places, the &s;ymptoms would every where appear with a uniformity &s;imilar to tho&s;e of &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>CONTAGION then, it would &s;eem, cannot ex|plain the phoenomena of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;tates or vici&s;&s;itudes of the atmo&s;phere; but the &s;tates or vici&s;&s;itudes of the atmo&s;phere will explain them, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of contagion. Here I will again avail my&s;elf of the authority of Dr. Ru&s;h, as far as importation is concerned.
<Q>The report of
<PB N="222" REF="033254_0213_0ff6aa1d7a3cf750">
the College of Phy&s;icians has &s;erved to con|firm me in an opinion, that the plagues which de&s;olated mo&s;t of the countries in Europe in former centuries, and which were always &s;aid to be foreign extraction, were in mo&s;t in&s;tan|ces of dome&s;tic origin. Between the years 1006 and 1680, the plague was epidemic 52 times all over Europe. It prevailed 14 times in the 14th century. The &s;tate of Europe in this long period is well known. Idlene&s;s, a deficiency of vegetable aliment, a camp life from the frequency of wars, famine, an un|cultivated and mar&s;hy &s;oil, &s;mall cabins, and the want of cleanline&s;s in dre&s;s, diet, and furniture, all concurred to generate pe&s;tilenti|al di&s;ea&s;es. The plagues which prevailed in London every year, from 1593 to 1611, and from 1636 to 1649, I &s;u&s;pect were generated in that city. The diminution of plagues in Europe, more e&s;pecially in London, appears to have been produced by the great change in the diet and manners of the people; al&s;o by the more commodious and airy forms of the hou&s;es of the poor, among whom the plague <HI>always</HI> makes its fir&s;t appearance. It is true the&s;e plagues were &s;aid by authors to have been im|ported, either directly or indirectly from the Levant; but the proofs of &s;uch importation were in mo&s;t ca&s;es as vague and deficient as they were of the We&s;t-India origin of our late
<PB N="223" REF="033254_0214_0ff6aa1fd4413610">
epidemic. The pe&s;tilentitl fevers, which have been mentioned, have been de&s;cribed by au|thors, by the generic name of the plague.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 265&mdash;166.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHY do pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es <HI>always</HI> make their fir&s;t appearance among the poor? Has contagi|ous matter an in&s;tinctive attachment to this cla&s;s of men? No. But they are con&s;tantly more ex|po&s;ed than the rich, to the principal power, which produces pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, viz. cer|tain &s;tates o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> certain vici&s;&s;itudes of the wea|ther.</P>
<P>THE vici&s;&s;itudes of the atmo&s;phere con&s;titute a power great, evident, and exten&s;ive, in its effects upon the animal and vegetable world:&mdash;a &s;ource, to which the epedemic and pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es of living bodies may, with certainty, be traced. Whereas contagious matter is a power that has uniformly been taken for granted, without ex|amination; of which the exi&s;tence, in epidemic and pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, is even di&s;proved by a numerous induction of facts; and, if admitted, is incapable of explaining their phaenomena.</P>
<P>FROM all the&s;e con&s;iderations, I conclude that no general di&s;ea&s;e, excepting &s;uch as occur only once during life, is contagious. And that all epidemic and pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, which occur more than once during life, and have hitherto
<PB N="224" REF="033254_0215_0ff6a9fce30bc958">
been reputed contagious, depend upon certain &s;tates, or certain vici&s;&s;itudes of the atmo&s;phere, together with the application of other powers, producing indirect debility.</P>
<P>VIEWING this as not merely a que&s;tion of idle medical di&s;putation, but as one of the utmo&s;t practical importance, I regret that neither my abilities nor my &s;ituation, enable me to do it that ju&s;tice, which it certainly de&s;erves. The attempt, which I have made, may however, be the means of calling forth the ob&s;ervations of others, better qualified to illu&s;trate the &s;ubject. Whether the exi&s;tence of contagion, in epidemic and pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, be ultimately proved, or di&s;proved, a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and deci&s;ion of the que&s;|tion mu&s;t be attended with con&s;iderable utility. Let us take a view of the pernicious con&s;equen|ces which re&s;ult from the opinion now received, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be fal&s;e; and contra&s;t it with the benefits that would ari&s;e from a contrary one, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be true.</P>
<P>THE con&s;ternation and mortality, occa&s;ioned by epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, mu&s;t always be greatly in|crea&s;ed, by a belief in their contagious nature. Tho&s;e who are yet well, will be the more readily affected; and tho&s;e who are ill, will be in great|er danger of &s;uffering, from the de&s;ertion of timid relations, or mercenary attendants. What &s;erious evils may not the dread of contagion
<PB N="225" REF="033254_0216_0ff6aa23d401c7c8">
produce, among the uninformed multitude, when it can occa&s;ion &s;uch &s;cenes as the following, among &s;en&s;ible men of the medical profe&s;&s;ion? In 1665, we find Dr. Hodges pre&s;cribing, from his parlor window, for patients in the &s;treets of London; and at a later period, Dr. P. Ru&s;&s;ell pre&s;cribing from a chamber window, fifteen feet above the level of the &s;treets at Aleppo. Dr. A. Ru&s;&s;ell's candid account of the manner in which he pre&s;cribed, is worthy of note; both as it tends to di&s;prove contagion, and to &s;hew the pernicious con&s;equences of believing in it.
<Q>In the two preceding years</Q>
(he wrote in 1744)
<Q>I had pre&s;cribed for the &s;ick, chiefly from the accounts brought me by a per&s;on, whom I em|ployed to vi&s;it them; for though before &s;hutt|ing up, I was often, in &s;pight of all my pre|cautions, deceived by fal&s;e repre&s;entations of the ca&s;e, and led to vi&s;it &s;ome of the infected; yet I avoided it to the utmo&s;t of my power: but this year the dread of contagion (like that of other dangers to which one has been long expo&s;ed) being much worn off, I attended the &s;ick in the plague in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e labouring under ordinary fevers.</Q>
Could Dr. Ru&s;&s;ell, or his deputy, have attended the &s;ick, with impunity, if the di&s;ea&s;e had been contagi|ous? In other words, can a power be applied, without producing its corre&s;pondent effect? I
<PB N="226" REF="033254_0217_0ff6aa28c695f960">
know not by what refinement of &s;ophi&s;try the force of this objection can be alluded. To come down to a period &s;till more recent, &s;ome of the phy&s;icians of Philadelphia are &s;aid to have fled the city, during the prevalence of their late epide|mic; a conduct that mu&s;t have added both to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he con&s;ternation and mortality of their patients. The effects of a popular belief in &s;uch opinions are, in my e&s;timation, no le&s;s injurious to man|kind, than they are humiliating to the medical profe&s;&s;ion. What would be &s;aid of a military officer, who de&s;erted his po&s;t at the &s;ight of an enemy, leaving his fellow-&s;oldiers to fight the battle? During the rage of an epidemic, phy|&s;icians may be looked upon as general officers, in whom it is always regarded more &s;hameful to abandon the field of battle, than in private &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>IF on the other hand, a belief in contagion was entirely laid a&s;ide, the European inhabitants of Aleppo, and other places &s;ubject to the plague, would no longer &s;hut them&s;elves up in their hou&s;|es, for fear of contagion. They would only re|main at home occa&s;ionally, to avoid the influence of the &s;un, or vici&s;&s;itudes of the weather. In&s;tead of a con&s;tant confinement for &s;everal months, they would only think it nece&s;&s;ary to refrain from go|ing abroad during the hotte&s;t part of the day; or to take precautions again&s;t the morning and
<PB N="227" REF="033254_0218_0ff6aa004f6dff38">
evening fogs. Thus the dread in&s;pired by the apprehen&s;ions of infection, would happily be ba|ni&s;hed from their minds; and that alone would be a powerful mean of protecting them from di&s;ea&s;e. It is not &s;uppo&s;ed, however, that the cu&s;tom of &s;hutting up is u&s;ele&s;s. The utility of it is evident; and it is as evidently founded upon a principle very different from that of avoiding contagion. By con|finement, the inhabitants of Aleppo avoid expo|&s;ure to heat, and the vici&s;&s;itudes of the weather, which are the real &s;ource of the plague. But their confinement, if regulated upon principle, need neither be &s;o con&s;tant nor &s;o anxious.</P>
<P>ANOTHER advantage that would re&s;ult from rejecting the doctrine of contagion, in pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, is that the quarantines u&s;ually exacted of &s;hips, coming from places &s;u&s;pected of contagion, would no longer be con&s;idered nece&s;&s;ary. The hard&s;hip, or rather the cruelty of &s;uch ordeals, is too evident to require a comment. Could the con|tagion be conveyed in the manner &s;uppo&s;ed, the injury to individuals mu&s;t of cour&s;e be &s;uffered, on account of the community. But if it be prov|ed that this cannot happen, the re&s;triction mu&s;t appear exceedingly ab&s;urd. Is it probable, that London being exempted from pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, for many years pa&s;t, will be imputed to the won|derful &s;trictne&s;s, with which Mediterranean
<PB N="228" REF="033254_0219_0ff6aa0274b61848">
&s;hips have been made to perform this forty days farce?</P>
<P>ABOVE all, the adoption of this theory, by recalling phy&s;icians from a wrong tract of inve&s;ti|gation, would probably be the means of enabling them to apply principles to the cure of all epide|mic di&s;ea&s;es, hitherto &s;o often fatal, which would render them little more dangerous, than common fevers are at this day.&mdash;In&s;tead of wa&s;ting time in tracing contagious matter from city to city, they would endeavour to di&s;cover what are the particular &s;tates or vici&s;&s;itudes of the atmo&s;phere, which produce epidemic di&s;ea&s;es; what are the cau&s;es of the&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes; and what are the be&s;t modes of counteracting their effects upon the hu|man body.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ubject is highly worthy of inve&s;tigation. For though it may be &s;aid that, as the &s;timu|lant powers, which are found to cure epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, afford a proof that they depend upon a very great degree of indirect debility, and that therefore a minute acquaintance with the pow|ers which occa&s;ioned them is not nece&s;&s;ary to guide the practice; yet it mu&s;t al&s;o be admitted, that every link, in the chain of knowledge, is a valuable acqui&s;ition.&mdash;There is not a fact in na|ture, from which &s;ome u&s;eful inference my not be drawn.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE CURE.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER be the powers that produce epi|demic di&s;ea&s;es, it is evident, from tho&s;e which are found to cure them, that they all depend upon a high &s;tate of indirect debility. Fevers and dy&s;entery have of late, every where, yielded to the powers of mercury, and other &s;timuli of the mo&s;t diffu&s;ible kind. That is, tho&s;e medi|cines have been found more &s;ucce&s;sful, than any that were ever u&s;ed before. If eight grains of calomel, and four grains of opium, repeated every two, three, or four hours, will cure a fever, or a dy&s;entery of a certain degree, will not the &s;ame medicines produce the &s;ame effect in plague&punc; if given in quantities proportionate to the force of the di&s;ea&s;e? Ought not the phy&s;icians of Aleppo to give a fair trial to a medicine in plague, which has been found &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in other epidemics? As plague, however, is a di&s;|ea&s;e, by all accounts, of a very high degree of exhau&s;tion, it may &s;ometimes be nece&s;&s;ary to go the length of, from fifteen to twenty grains of calomel, or even more, in repeated do&s;es. The duration of the action of each do&s;e, &s;hould re|gulate their repetition; but that does not &s;eem
<PB N="230" REF="033254_0221_0ff6aa2e64795378">
to be yet accurately a&s;certained. It appears, as far as I have been able to ob&s;erve, that the in|tervals, between the do&s;es of mercury, ought not to be longer than two or three hours.&mdash;In exhi|biting this medicine, it is a fact worthy of re|mark, and de&s;erves to be particularly remember|ed when large do&s;es are required, that by a &s;ud|den &s;ubduction of it, the patient is apt to have a very &s;ore mouth, a violent &s;alivation, and &s;ome|times an alarming di&s;charge of blood from the fauces. When any of the&s;e &s;ymptoms unex|pectedly occur, it will be found, that the pati|ent has &s;uddenly left off his medicine, or has taken it in &s;uch an irregular manner, as to pro|duce &s;imilar effects. This will often happen, from the imprudence of patients, in the hands of the mo&s;t &s;kilful phy&s;icians; but it perhaps more frequently occurs, from an ignorance of the fact. Although it has already been noticed in my "Treati&s;e on the Action of Mercury," yet it appears proper to in&s;i&s;t upon it, in a more particular manner, when that medicine is pro|po&s;ed to be given in a di&s;ea&s;e, that will probably require its exhibition in unprecedented quanti|ties. Suppo&s;e a ca&s;e of plague to require the exhibition of a &s;cruple of calomel every two or three hours, if it was &s;uddenly left off, an alarm|ing hemorrhagy would in mo&s;t ca&s;es en&s;ue. It would be of con&s;iderable advantage to the prac|titioner, to know that this effect was produced
<PB N="231" REF="033254_0222_0ff6aa04a0ba24b0">
by the too &s;udden &s;ubduction of the high &s;timu|lant power, which had been for &s;ome time pre|viou&s;ly applied to the body; and that it may be prevented by the regular exhibition and gradu|al reduction; or removed by the re-application of the &s;ame power, or the &s;ub&s;titution of others equivalent in force. Vici&s;&s;itudes in the applica|tion of &s;ub&s;tances, u&s;ed in medicine, will pro|duce di&s;ea&s;e, as well as vici&s;&s;itudes in the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, or in the force of any other ex|citing power. But an application of the &s;ame powers, in a due degree, will remove the di&s;|ea&s;es which an exce&s;&s;ive or deficient application, or alterations in the force of them may have oc|ca&s;ioned.</P>
<P>THE terms exce&s;s and deficiency, in the ap|plication of external powers to living bodies, do not relate to the &s;um of &s;timulus u&s;ually applied in a &s;tate of health, but to the &s;tate of the ex|citability at the time.</P>
