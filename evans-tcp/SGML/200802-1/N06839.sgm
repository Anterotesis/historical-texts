<HEAD>SERMON I. Of the great Importance of Sinners turning their Feet unto GOD's Te&s;timonies.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM CXIX. 59, 60.</HI></BIBL>
<P>I THOUGHT on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy te&s;timonies:</P>
<P>I MADE ha&s;te, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT being of no great con&s;equence to us to know,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM I.</NOTE> I &s;hall not now &s;pend time to inquire, whether the P&s;al|mi&s;t here refers to his thinking on his ways after falling into &s;ome particular great &s;in, or &s;ins, as good men are liable to fall; and his &s;peedily turning his feet again unto God's te&s;timonies, in con&s;e|quence
<PB N="2" REF="008667_0007_102fad526d4249d8">
of &s;uch reflection: Or whether he refers to &s;ome period, po&s;&s;ibly in his early youth, when he was not yet a true fearer and &s;ervant of God; but being brought to a &s;erious con&s;ideration of his ways, and the fatal tendency of them, he then, with|out delay, altered the general cour&s;e of his life; turning from his former wicked|ne&s;s, to the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s; and &s;o, of a child of di&s;obedience and wrath, be|coming a &s;on of God, and an heir of &s;al|vation. I &s;ay, I do not conceive it to be of much importance to us to inquire into this matter: For there is evidently a two|fold repentance, or turning to God, and to the keeping of his te&s;timonies and com|mandments; to both of which, &s;ober re|flection, or thinking on our ways, is re|qui&s;ite and conducive; and both of which may, I &s;uppo&s;e, properly come under con&s;ideration, in a di&s;cour&s;e upon the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. The fir&s;t is that of wicked, unrighteous men; of tho&s;e who have lived unmindful of God, and of their duty to him; tho&s;e who have habitually violated his commandments in the prece|ding part of their lives; till, by &s;ome means or other, being put upon &s;erious thought and reflection, they are induced to for&s;ake their &s;ins, and to enter upon a new cour&s;e of life, a life of piety, virtue
<PB N="3" REF="008667_0008_102fad54669c4700">
and religion. And this is what, in the language of &s;cripture, is more generally intended by repentance, or turning to God and his commandments. But there is a &s;econdary repentance and reformation, or turning to God's te&s;timon&iuml;es, which is proper to good and holy men, who have in general kept the commandments. For even the righteous may, in times of great temptation, or at any time, if they are not circum&s;pect and watchful, fall into con&s;iderable &s;ins, and come very &s;hort of their duty in many re&s;pects. And &s;uch men are generally, if not always, by the good providence and grace of God, ex|cited to think on their ways, and amend them; to
<Q>remember from whence they are fallen, to repent, and to do the fir&s;t works.</Q>
This, you perceive, is a re|pentance, or turning to God's te&s;timo|nies, different in &s;ome re&s;pects from that before-mentioned, the &s;ubjects of it being &s;o different. It is indeed common to the &s;ubjects of both, to have broken the com|mandments of God, and to have gone con|trary to his te&s;timonies; this being im|plied in turning their feet unto them. But then the &s;ubjects of the former repentance and reformation, are cu&s;tomary, habitual &s;inners, who&s;e whole cour&s;e and in&s;titu|tion of life is hereby changed; whereas
<PB N="4" REF="008667_0009_102fad55ece8c3e0">
the &s;ubjects of the latter, are righteous, good men, who having in &s;ome re&s;pects violated their duty, return to it, and keep the commandments of God more circum|&s;pectly. It is but once that a man exer|ci&s;es repentance towards God in the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e, as it &s;ignifies the breaking off a &s;in|ful, and entering upon a new, an holy, and divine, life: But repentance, or turn|ing to God, in the latter &s;en&s;e, may, and ought to be, and is, often repeated in this imperfect &s;tate; even as often as a good man deviates from the path of his duty, and returns to it with an humble and con|trite heart.</P>
<P>Now, what the particular ca&s;e of the P&s;almi&s;t was, to which he refers in the pa&s;&s;age I have cho&s;en for the &s;ubject of &s;everal di&s;cour&s;es; whether he refers to the time of his fir&s;t conver&s;ion to God, from the ways of &s;in and folly, or to that of his recovery from &s;ome criminal lap&s;e after he had known the way of righteou&s;|ne&s;s; every one is left to his own opinion, as a thing that is very immaterial in it&s;elf, or at lea&s;t to my pre&s;ent de&s;ign. Neither do I think it of any great impor|tance now to inquire, what was the &s;pe|cial and more immediate occa&s;ion of the P&s;almi&s;t's being thus led to think on his ways, and to walk in God's te&s;timonies;
<PB N="5" REF="008667_0010_102fad5d5d023178">
whether it were &s;ickne&s;s, or &s;ome other a|wakening vi&s;itation of divine providence; whether it were affliction and adver&s;ity of any kind, or that abounding goodne&s;s and mercy of God, the de&s;ign of which is to lead men to repentance; or la&s;tly, whe|ther there might not po&s;&s;ibly be a con|currence of &s;everal means, to the co|operation of which, under the influence and ble&s;&s;ing of God who worketh all in all, this happy effect was to be a&s;cribed.</P>
<P>THE judgments of God are un&s;earch|able; and none can find out either the Al|mighty, or his ways, unto perfection. But we know in general, that there is a great variety of means which God makes u&s;e of, to bring about the de&s;igns of his pro|vidence and grace; and which, particu|larly, he u&s;es for the awakening and re|formation of &s;inners; to reclaim them from the ways of folly and de&s;truction, to the wi&s;dom of the ju&s;t, and cau&s;e them to walk in his te&s;timonies. Tho' God is omnipotent, yet he &s;eldom or never works wholly without means. He did not even produce the world by a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> immediate ex|ertion, or act of his own power; but he "created all things by Je&s;us Chri&s;t."<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Eph. 3.9 comp. Col 1.16. Joh. 1.3. &amp; Heb 1.2. &amp; 10.</NOTE> And as God originally created, &s;o he &s;till go|verns the world by his Son; and by the means and in&s;trumentality of other beings,
<PB N="6" REF="008667_0011_102fad5ee8e4fe80">
and &s;econdary cau&s;es. And among&s;t tho&s;e which he employs for the convincing and reclaiming of &s;inners, and bringing many &s;ons unto glory, &s;ome are &s;tated and na|tural, others extraordinary and miracu|lous. It is chiefly the former, viz. the natural and &s;tated means, and very &s;eldom the latter, or miraculous ones, at lea&s;t in this age of the world, that God u&s;es to this end. Saul, afterwards Paul the A|po&s;tle, and &s;ome few others of old, &s;eem indeed to have been preternaturally &s;top|ped in their wicked cour&s;es, and converted to God; that per&s;ecutor of the &s;aints ha|ving been at once &s;truck blind, and &s;truck to the earth, in his journey to Dama&s;cus, while he heard a voice from heaven, &s;ay|ing unto him,
<Q>Saul, Saul, why per&s;e|cute&s;t thou me?</Q>
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Acts 9.3, &amp;c.</NOTE> There may po&s;&s;ibly have been &s;ome examples, even in the&s;e la&s;t ages, of a &s;udden and extraordinary conver&s;ion, not very di&s;&s;imilar to this. However, &s;uch things have neither been common and frequent in any age, even the age of miracles, nor are they to be expected in this. God has favoured us with a plain, &s;tanding revelation of his will, long &s;ince &s;ufficiently confirmed and e&s;tabli&s;hed
<Q>by &s;igns, and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q>
Herein both his mercy and
<PB N="7" REF="008667_0012_102fad6072613f50">
his wrath are clearly revealed from hea|ven; the former, to tho&s;e who think of their ways, and turn their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> unto his te&s;timonies; the latter,
<Q>again&s;t all un|godline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men.</Q>
And to this revelation God ju&s;tly expects, that we &s;hould diligently attend; receiv|ing the truth in the love of it, and govern|ing our lives and actions by the rules of it. For this grace of God which has appear|ed unto us, teaches us that,
<Q>denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in the pre&s;ent world.</Q>
And this we are indi&s;pen&s;ably bound to do, even tho' nothing very &s;ignal or re|markable &s;hould occur in the cour&s;e of God's providence, whether in the way of judgment or of mercy, to put us upon thinking on our ways, and turning to him. However, there are often &s;uch di&s;pen&s;ations of providence as the&s;e; cal|culated in the nature and de&s;ign of them, to rouze and awaken the minds of men to that &s;erious and religious &s;en&s;e of things, which becomes them. And the&s;e events of providence, tho' perhaps di&s;re|garded by many, will yet, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, have their de&s;igned good effect upon others; cau&s;ing them to think on their ways, to make ha&s;te, and not delay
<PB N="8" REF="008667_0013_102fad63afe21e20">
to keep his commandments. To this it is to be added, that God is almo&s;t con|tinually &s;triving with us by his holy Spi|rit, which co-operates with his word and providences to awaken &s;inners, and lead them to repentance: Tho', alas! there are many be&s;ides the I&s;raelites, who
<Q>do always re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t;</Q>
and grieve and quench the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of God, till they are given over of him to a reprobate mind; and left to trea&s;ure up unto them&s;elves wrath again&s;t the day of wrath, and the revelation of his righteous judgment; who will finally
<Q>render to every man according to his deeds.</Q></P>
<P>BUT to return: Whatever might be the particular ca&s;e of the P&s;almi&s;t, to which he refers in the text; and whatever were the di&s;pen&s;ations of God's providence to|wards him at that time; &s;till we are cer|tain of the&s;e three things; That he
<Q>tho't on his ways;</Q>
That, in con&s;equence hereof, he
<Q>turned his feet unto God's te&s;timonies;</Q>
and, That he did this &s;peedily; or, in his own more emphatical language, That he
<Q>made ha&s;te, and de|lay'd not to keep his commandments.</Q>
And as every one under&s;tands well e|nough in general, what is intended by turning our feet unto God's te&s;timonies, and keeping his commandments, I &s;hall
<PB N="9" REF="008667_0014_102fad6a6c6d2f28">
not needle&s;ly &s;pend time in explaining it: But</P>
<P>MY de&s;ign is, in the fir&s;t place, to re|pre&s;ent to you the great, yea, infinite im|portance hereof, by &s;everal con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>I SHALL then &s;how, by a variety of arguments, the va&s;t importance of being &s;peedy in this bu&s;ine&s;s; and the extreme folly and danger of delaying it.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;onablene&s;s of thinking on our ways, together with the nece&s;&s;ity and conducivene&s;s hereof to a reformation of them, will be &s;hown in the third place. And</P>
<P>LASTLY, I &s;hall make &s;ome applica|tion of this &s;ubject, in a &s;erious, recapitu|latory addre&s;s to you: Nor &s;hall I omit to take a particular notice therein of the late alarming vi&s;itations of divine pro|vidence, which are &s;o peculiarly adapted to awaken us all to con&s;ider our ways, and to amend them; and which have, accordingly, led my thoughts to the pre|&s;ent &s;ubject. And I &s;hall endeavour, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to handle the &s;ubject in &s;uch a manner as to render it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, profitable both to wicked men and good; to tho&s;e who have hitherto lived in the habitual violation of God's commandments, &s;o as to need a total change of heart and manners; and to
<PB N="10" REF="008667_0015_102fad6c099ab5b0">
tho&s;e who, although they may have long been the true &s;ervants of the Mo&s;t High, yet need to be awakened to greater watchfulne&s;s and circum&s;pection, and more diligence in working the work of God.</P>
<P>FIRST, I am to repre&s;ent to you the great, yea, infinite importance which it is to &s;inners, to turn their feet unto God's te&s;timonies, and to keep his command|ments. For this is &s;o far from being a matter of indifference, of little or no con|&s;equence to us, that there is hardly any thing el&s;e which claims our care and at|tention; to be &s;ure, nothing in compari&s;on of it. Now the va&s;t importance hereof is apparent from many con&s;iderations; and more particularly from the four following ones, which I &s;hall enlarge upon in this, and in the next en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e. It appears</P>
<P N="1">1^s^t^. FROM a general con&s;ideration of God's power and greatne&s;s, his holine&s;s and univer&s;al dominion, and our ab&s;olute dependence upon him.</P>
<P N="2">2^d^l^y^. FROM the clear and po&s;itive de|nunciations of his wrath, in his word, again&s;t all impenitent, irreclaimable tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P N="3">3^d^l^y^. FROM the great and precious pro|mi&s;es of the go&s;pel made to tho&s;e who
<PB N="11" REF="008667_0016_102fad6d9c67ba80">
turn at God's reproof, and keep his com|mandments.</P>
<P N="4">4^t^h^l^y^. FROM a con&s;ideration of that a&s;toni&s;hing method which God has pro|jected for our &s;alvation from the dominion of &s;in, and the puni&s;hment due to it.</P>
<P>THESE things which I have mention|ed, being &s;eriou&s;ly and properly attended to, no one can doubt but that it is of infinite importance to tho&s;e who have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the laws of God, to turn their feet unto his te&s;timonies, and to walk in his commandments. And I mu&s;t ju&s;t re|mind you, that this is what all of us have done, in a greater or le&s;s degree; it being certain, that both jews and gentiles are "all under &s;in;" and the whole world become "guilty before God:" Which could not be, except all had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed his laws; for
<Q>&s;in is the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law.</Q>
We are therefore all con|cerned in the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, either more or le&s;s; and &s;hould impartially apply it to our&s;elves, according to truth and equity.</P>
<P N="1">1^s^t^. The importance of turning our feet unto God's te&s;timonies, appears from a general con&s;ideration of his power and greatne&s;s, his holine&s;s and univer&s;al do|minion, and our ab&s;olute dependence up|on him. When we reflect upon the&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="008667_0017_102fad70d76810c0">
things, it is at fir&s;t view very evident, how greatly it concerns us to &s;ecure to our|&s;elves the good-will and patronage of our Maker, by obeying his commandments; and what a terrible hazard we run, by per&s;i&s;ting in our rebellion again&s;t him, and in oppo&s;ition to his righteous government. It is certainly wi&s;e in men, and mu&s;t fi|nally turn to their un&s;peakable advantage to plea&s;e that being, who is infinite in wi&s;dom; to &s;ubmit to his authority, who&s;e kingdom ruleth over all; to re&s;emble, in their own tempers and manners, him who is perfectly holy, ju&s;t and good; to en|gage the friend&s;hip and protection of him, who is all-powerful; and in fine, to adore, to love and obey him, in whom all the&s;e adoreable qualities and perfections are u|nited. And if it is wi&s;e and prudent for men to do thus; then it certainly becomes them, whenever they have done otherwi&s;e in any degree, and neglected their duty and true&s;t intere&s;t, to be heartily &s;orry for it; and to amend their ways. Now thus wi&s;e for them&s;elves, are all they, who, with the P&s;almi&s;t, think of their ways, and return to God, from whom they have gone a&s;tray. And if this is the mo&s;t wi&s;e and prudent cour&s;e for &s;inners to take; if, do|ing thus, they be&s;t con&s;ult both their pre|&s;ent and future intere&s;t; how fooli&s;h and
<PB N="13" REF="008667_0018_102fad770ac3b108">
mad, on the contrary, is the conduct of tho&s;e, and how certainly are they de&s;troy|ing them&s;elves, who continue in their op|po&s;ition to infinite wi&s;dom; and their re|bellion again&s;t the great lord and &s;overeign of the univer&s;e? they who, by per&s;evering in their wicked ways, continue to be as unlike as they can to the mo&s;t perfect and amiable of beings? they who provoke that infinite power, which can either deprive them of exi&s;tence in a moment, or pre|&s;erve them in it forever, to puni&s;h their di&s;|obedience and temerity? they who daily abu&s;e, affront and bla&s;pheme that mo&s;t a|doreable being, in who&s;e hand their breath is, and who&s;e are all their ways? How fooli&s;h, imprudent, and even mad, I &s;ay, are &s;uch per&s;ons? and how &s;urely do they "&s;eek death in the error of their life?" And yet thus do all they, who having departed from God's te&s;timonies, will not turn their feet to them again; but per&s;e|vere in violating his holy commandments; of whom, alas! there are &s;o many thro'|out the world; and even in that part of it which is called chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>THIS conduct of &s;inners mu&s;t, one wou'd think, proceed from great ignorance of God and them&s;elves; for if that light of divine truth which &s;hines around them, did actually &s;hine into their hearts, &s;o as
<PB N="14" REF="008667_0019_102fad78d36a69c8">
to give them the knowledge of the glory and maje&s;ty of God, it would be morally impo&s;&s;ible for them to act &s;uch a part to|wards him. No man who has a ju&s;t con|ception of the greatne&s;s and glory of that being, who created all things, and upholds them all by the word of his power; who is both the righteous lawgiver, and im|partial judge of the world, equally able to &s;ave and to de&s;troy; no man who has a ju&s;t conception of almighty God, I &s;ay, and who thinks &s;oberly of him&s;elf as he ought to think, being duly &s;en&s;ible of his own weakne&s;s, littlene&s;s and dependent condition, can help &s;eeing the infinite im|portance which it is to him to for&s;ake his &s;inful cour&s;es, and to work righteou&s;ne&s;s: No one can help &s;eeing, that upon doing &s;o, his whole intere&s;t and being depend. It were certainly better for us never to have been born, or even now to be redu|ced to nothing, by the breath which gave us being, than, by continuing to rebel a|gain&s;t the mo&s;t high God, to remain under his di&s;plea&s;ure; not only excluded from a &s;hare in his loving-kindne&s;s, which is better than life; but al&s;o the objects of his wrath, which is wor&s;e than death. Who can, on one hand, fully expre&s;s the hap|pine&s;s of tho&s;e who love and &s;erve God, and are beloved of him? Who, on the o|ther
<PB N="15" REF="008667_0020_102fad7ab6afe890">
hand, knoweth the power of his an|ger; and the mi&s;ery of tho&s;e who continue liable to the terrible effects and con&s;equen|ces of it? Reflect a little upon the a&s;to|ni&s;hing effects of God's power, vi&s;ible in the material world;
<Q>look unto the hea|vens, and &s;ee, and behold the clouds which are higher than thou;</Q>
contem|plate the great works of God in the earth beneath, the &s;ea, and upon the dry land: And when you have, by con&s;idering the&s;e works of God, attained to a ju&s;t concep|tion of his greatne&s;s and maje&s;ty, then doubt, if you can, whether it be a thing of the la&s;t importance to you to be at peace with him; to have him for your friend and protector? whether his favour is not more to be de&s;ired than life? and whether, to be the object of his wrath, is not wor&s;e than death? And if this is a thing of any con&s;equence to you, it is e|qually &s;o, whether you do, or do not turn to God, and keep his commandments: For upon this it depends, whether God, the &s;overeign ruler and potentate, who doeth his will in the armies of heaven, and among&s;t the inhabitants of the earth, &s;hall be your friend or your enemy. We may be certain from the mere light of na|ture, that impious and unrighteous men mu&s;t be the objects of God's di&s;plea&s;ure;

and that it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of him that liveth forever, as the victims of his anger: For how &s;hould a man's heart endure, or his hands be &s;trong, when God deals with him in righteous &s;everity; and gives him the due reward of his deeds! But</P>
<P>THIS brings me to the &s;econd thing mentioned, in order to &s;how the impor|tance of turning our feet unto God's te&s;timonies, and keeping his command|ments; viz.</P>
<P N="2">2^d^l^y^. THE clear and po&s;itive denuncia|tions of his wrath, in his word, again&s;t all impenitent, irreclaimable tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. Th&ocirc; it is at lea&s;t probable from the light of nature, that we &s;hall exi&s;t in a future &s;tate; and alth&ocirc; it is a dictate of rea&s;on and natural con&s;cience, that if we actually exi&s;t thus hereafter, vicious, ungodly men &s;hall undergo &s;ome &s;trange puni&s;hment, as inflicted by the righteous Lord and Gover|nor of the univer&s;e; yet men in general being &s;low at rea&s;oning, and &s;o much at|tached to this world, that they will &s;carce give them&s;elves time to think &s;eriou&s;ly of another, or to con&s;ider what mu&s;t in all probability be the con&s;equence, as it is the ju&s;t demerit, of a wicked life; God has therefore &s;ent his prophets and apo&s;tles, and even his own Son, to admoni&s;h and
<PB N="17" REF="008667_0022_102fad816d7ff6e8">
warn us; to call us to repentance, and to denounce his wrath and righteous ven|geance again&s;t bold, pre&s;umptuous &s;inners. By them his wrath is now mo&s;t clearly re|vealed from heaven again&s;t all ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men; and it is de|nounced equally, both again&s;t them that "hold the truth in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s," and them that do not hold the truth at all, but hate and reject it,
<Q>le&s;t their deeds which are evil &s;hould be reproved.</Q>
And this wrath of God is revealed in &s;uch terms as no &s;inner that hears them, can either ea&s;ily mi&s;take the &s;en&s;e of, or avoid trembling at; unle&s;s he is more hardened and aban|doned than even Felix was, when St. Paul

<P>I HAVE no fondne&s;s for u&s;ing har&s;h, and very terrifying language in preaching; and could heartily wi&s;h there was never any occa&s;ion for it. But it is manife&s;t from the holy &s;criptures, and indeed from our own experience and ob&s;ervation, that &s;ome &s;inners are &s;o in love with their lu&s;ts and vices, as to need &s;uch language in or|der to their being reclaimed from them. Yea, experience &s;hows, that even all the terrible menaces in God's word are in|&s;ufficient to produce a reformation in &s;ome hardened, and bold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; yea, I

may add, they are &s;o far from working any thor&ocirc; and la&s;ting amendment in them, that they hardly awaken them to any degree of &s;erious tho'tfulne&s;s concerning their latter end. This being the ca&s;e, I imagine there is not only no impropriety, but an evident expediency, and even nece&s;&s;ity, in a di&s;cour&s;e upon this &s;ubject, of plainly laying before men the threatnings of God in his word, again&s;t tho&s;e who per&s;evere in their wicked cour&s;es; which, by his ble&s;&s;ing, may prove &s;alvation to their &s;ouls: But whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, the mini&s;ters of religion are required, in order to the delivering their own &s;ouls, and being clear from the blood of all men, to give them warning as from God: that &s;o their guilt may be all their own, and their de&s;truction of them&s;elves, if they per&s;i&s;t in their un|godly deeds. What God &s;ays to the pro|phet Ezekiel, <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Chap. 3. ver. 17, 18, 19.</NOTE> is applicable in &s;ome mea|&s;ure to every man, who is by office a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s:
<Q>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the hou&s;e of I&s;rael: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. When I &s;ay unto the wicked, Thou &s;halt &s;urely die; and thou give&s;t him not warning; nor &s;peake&s;t to warn the wicked from his wicked way to &s;ave

his life, the &s;ame wicked man &s;hall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wick|ed way, he &s;hall die in his iniquity; but thou ha&s;t delivered thy &s;oul.</Q>
You mu&s;t therefore &s;uffer me plainly to repre&s;ent to you the threatnings, which God has de|nounced again&s;t &s;uch as di&s;regard his te&s;|timonies, and violate his commandments. This I &s;hall do in the very language of &s;cripture: for I do not think it proper to indulge to my own imagination, or even to u&s;e my own words, upon &s;o &s;olemn and tremendous a &s;ubject.</P>
<P>IN the &s;criptures of the old te&s;tament we find &s;uch declarations and threatnings as the&s;e. In the 27^t^h chapter of the book of Deuteronomy, after a cur&s;e has been particularly denounced again&s;t &s;everal &s;orts of &s;inners, there is a general one de|nounced again&s;t all the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the law in common, in the following terms:
<Q>Cur&s;ed <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The apo&s;tle Paul gives us the &s;en&s;e of this malediction, Gal. 3.10. in the following words, &mdash; <Q>It is written, Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</Q></NOTE> is he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them: and all the people &s;hall &s;ay, Amen.</Q>
It is &s;aid P&s;alm 11^t^h That
<Q>the Lord is in his holy tem|ple, the Lord's throne is in heaven; his
<PB N="20" REF="008667_0025_102fad89233b5150">
eyes behold, his eylids try the children of men. The Lord trieth the righteous; but the wicked, and him that loveth violence, his &s;oul hateth. Upon the wicked he &s;hall rain &s;nares, fire and brim&s;tone, and an horrible tempe&s;t: this &s;hall be the portion of their cup.</Q>
It is &s;aid in the book of Job, chap. 20^t^h, That
<Q>the triumphing of the wicked is &s;hort, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment. Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; yet he &s;hall peri&s;h for|ever, like his own dung</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>God &s;hall ca&s;t the fury of his wrath upon him, and &s;hall rain it upon him</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>The hea|ven &s;hall reveal his iniquity, and the earth &s;hall ri&s;e up again&s;t him</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed to him by God.</Q>
It is &s;aid in the 12^t^h chapter of the prophecy of Daniel, That
<Q>many of them that &s;leep in the du&s;t of the earth &s;hall awake, &s;ome to everla&s;ting life, and &s;ome to &s;hame, and everla&s;ting con|tempt.</Q>
It is &s;aid in the prophecy of Malachi,
<Q>Then &s;hall ye return, and di&s;|cern between the righteous and the wicked; between him that &s;erveth God, and him that &s;erveth him not. For be|hold the day cometh that &s;hall burn as

an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly &s;hall be &s;tubble; and the day that cometh &s;hall burn them up, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, that it &s;hall leave them neither root nor branch.</Q>
And be|cau&s;e wicked men are apt to flatter them|&s;elves with the hopes of impunity, even while they hear the cur&s;e of God denoun|ced again&s;t them, therefore it is &s;aid, Deute|ronomy 29^t^h chap.&mdash;
<Q>Le&s;t there be among you a root that beareth gall and worm|wood; and it come to pa&s;s, when he heareth the words of this cur&s;e, that he ble&s;s him&s;elf in his heart, &s;aying, I &s;hall have peace, th&ocirc; I walk in the imagina|tion of mine heart, to add drunkenne&s;s to thir&s;t: the Lord will not &s;pare him, but then the anger of the Lord, and his jealou&s;y &s;hall &s;moke again&s;t that man, and all the cur&s;es that are written in this book &s;hall lie upon him, and the Lord &s;hall blot out his name from under hea|ven: and the Lord &s;hall &s;eparate him unto evil.</Q>
Agreeably hereto, it is &s;aid in the per&s;on of wi&s;dom, Proverbs chap. 1^s^t.
<Q>How long, ye &s;imple ones, will ye love &s;implicity? and the &s;corners delight in &s;corning, and fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my repoof</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>Becau&s;e I have called, and ye refu&s;ed; I have &s;tretched out my hand, and no man re|garded;
<PB N="22" REF="008667_0027_102fad935683afe8">
but ye have &s;et at nought all my coun&s;el, and would none of my re|proof: I al&s;o will laugh at your cala|mity, I will mock when your fear com|eth; when your fear cometh as de&s;ola|tion, and your de&s;truction cometh as a whirlwind; when di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h cometh upon you. Then &s;hall they call upon me, but I will not an&s;wer; they &s;hall &s;eek me early, but they &s;hall not find me; for that they hated knowledge, and did not choo&s;e the fear of the Lord.</Q>
Now when wi&s;dom crieth thus without, and utters her voice in this manner, by way of warning to &s;inners, it is, I &s;uppo&s;e, the &s;ame thing in effect as if God him&s;elf had &s;poken to them in the like language; which is, indeed, very &s;olemn and terrifying.</P>
<P>BUT let us, from the old, proceed to the &s;criptures of the new te&s;tament, and &s;ee what is &s;aid therein to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e; I mean, by way of threatning again&s;t the impenitent tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of God's com|mandments and te&s;timonies. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour in his explanation of the parable of the tares, Matthew 13^t^h, &s;ays,&mdash;
<Q>The harve&s;t is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are gathered, and burnt in the fire; &s;o &s;hall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man &s;hall &s;end forth his an|gels,
<PB N="23" REF="008667_0028_102fad952d200080">
and they &s;hall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and &s;hall ca&s;t them into a furnace of fire: there &s;hall be wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth.</Q>
In the 25^t^h chapter of the &s;ame go&s;pel of St. Mat|thew, where the proceedings of the la&s;t day are more largely and particularly re|pre&s;ented to us than any where el&s;e, our Lord has declared, that when he is &s;eated upon the throne of his glory, and all na|tions are gathered before him, he will &s;ay to the wicked on his left hand,
<Q>Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</Q>
and that, in con&s;equence of this mo&s;t awful but righteous &s;entence,
<Q>the&s;e &s;hall go a|way into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment.</Q>
It is &s;aid in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, chap. 17. That God
<Q>now commandeth all men every where to repent; becau&s;e he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, by that man whom he hath ordained.</Q>
And Romans 2^d. it is &s;aid, that God
<Q>will render to every man according to his deeds:</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>unto them that are conten|tious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, indignation and wrath; tribulation and angui&s;h upon every &s;oul of man that doeth evil, of the
<PB N="24" REF="008667_0029_102fad9a4c7f0d08">
Jew fir&s;t, and al&s;o of the Gentile</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>For there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons with God.</Q>
It is declared in the &s;econd epi&s;tle to the The&s;&s;alonians, chap. 1^s^t, That
<Q>the Lord Je&s;us &s;hall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, tak|ing vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</Q>
And in the 14^t^h chapter of the revelation of St. John, it is &s;aid of the wicked, that
<Q>the &s;ame &s;hall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mix|ture, into the cup of his indignation; and he &s;hall be tormented with fire and brim&s;tone, in the pre&s;ence of the holy angels, and in the pre&s;ence of the lamb: and the &s;moke of their torment a&s;cen|deth up for ever and ever; and they have no re&s;t day nor night.</Q>
&mdash;Such are the expre&s;s, po&s;itive declarations found in the new te&s;tament re&s;pecting the future perdition of ungodly men; of all &s;uch as will not think of their ways in time, and turn their feet unto God's te&s;timonies.</P>
<P>AND it will be proper to remind you here, that le&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity &s;hould flatter them&s;elves that the&s;e and
<PB N="25" REF="008667_0030_102fad9d6059d088">
&s;uch-like threatnings in the word of God, are denounced only again&s;t the unbeliev|ing, heathen world; again&s;t tho&s;e who ei|ther never heard of the Go&s;pel, or having heard of it, openly and profe&s;&s;edly reject it; our Lord has admoni&s;hed us, that they be|long equally to wicked believers, with unbelievers, even th&ograve; they make high pre|ten&s;ions to religion, and of love and re|&s;pect to him,
<Q>eating and drinking in his pre&s;ence.</Q>
For he has a&s;&s;ured us, that he will hereafter &s;ay to all &s;uch hypocriti|cal profe&s;&s;ors of his name and religion,
<Q>Depart from me, I know you not whence you are, all ye workers of iniquity.</Q>
Yea farther, it is to be ob&s;erved, that th&ocirc; the go&s;pel is &s;o emphatically a di&s;pen&s;ation of grace and mercy to &s;inners, yet it is plain|ly declared therein, that they who con|tinue in their &s;ins and di&s;obedience, while they know the truth, and their duty, &s;hall receive a far heavier doom hereafter, than either wicked pagans, or wicked men un|der the legal di&s;pen&s;ation. There is a pa&s;&s;age full to the fir&s;t of the&s;e points in the go&s;pel of St. Matthew: <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Chap. XI. ver. 20.</NOTE>
<Q>Then be|gan he to upbraid the cities wherein mo&s;t of his mighty works were done, becau&s;e they repented not. Wo unto thee, Chorazin, wo unto thee, Beth&s;aida; for if the mighty works which were
<PB N="26" REF="008667_0031_102fada06494bf00">
done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes. But I &s;ay unto you, It &s;hall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judge|ment, than for you. And thou, Ca|pernaum, which art exalted unto hea|ven, &s;halt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works which have been done in you, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained unto this day. But it &s;hall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, in the day of judgment, than for you.</Q>
The words of our Sa|viour el&s;ewhere, are much to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; only of more general and uni|ver&s;al extent:
<Q>And that &s;ervant which knew his lord's will, and prepared not him&s;elf, neither did according to his will, &s;hall be beaten with many &s;tripes. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of &s;tripes, &s;hall be beaten with few &s;tripes: For unto whom&s;oe|ver much is given, of him &s;hall be much required: and to whom men have com|mitted much, of him they will a&s;k the more.</Q>
<NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">Luke XII.47, 48.</NOTE> And the&s;e words of our Saviour &s;ugge&s;t to us one, th&ograve; not the only, ground and rea&s;on, why wicked and incorrigible men, living under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, &s;hall incur a &s;orer puni&s;hment hereafter,
<PB N="27" REF="008667_0032_102fada2648faa38">
than &s;uch men under the law of Mo&s;es; the former being a clearer and more perfect di&s;covery and revelation of God's will, than the latter, as it was made by a far more glorious per&s;onage, the Son of God in our nature. And to this purpo&s;e are the following pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture:
<Q>If we &s;in wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there re|maineth no more &s;acrifice for &s;ins; but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation to devour the ad|ver&s;aries.

<Q>If the word &s;poken by angels</Q>

<P>CERTAINLY they who duly con&s;ider the&s;e, and &s;uch-like pa&s;&s;ages of holy &s;crip|ture, cannot encourage and harden them|&s;elves in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of, or in di&s;obe|dience to, the commandments of Chri&s;t, by reflecting upon the grace revealed in the go&s;pel; or from an imagination that any faith in Chri&s;t, or dependence upon his righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is con&s;i&s;tent with habitual &s;inning again&s;t him, will &s;kreen them from his ju&s;t indignation, when the great day of his wrath &s;hall come. In that day none will be able to &s;tand, excepting tho&s;e who, having believed in God thr&ocirc; him, have turned their feet unto his te&s;ti|monies, and been
<Q>careful to maintain good works.</Q>
Without this, our faith will not profit us in the day of wrath, any more than our riches: yea, it will &s;erve to aggravate our guilt and mi&s;ery, far beyond that of vicious Jews and Pagans.</P>

The &s;ame mount Sinai, from which his holy law had been proclaimed in &s;uch maje&s;ty and terror, &s;aw him &s;oon after pa&s;&s;ing by, and proclaiming his name,
<Q>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-&s;uffering, and abundant in goodne&s;s and truth, keeping mercy for thou&s;ands, forgiving iniquity and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Exodus XXXIV.5, 6, 7.</NOTE></Q>
&mdash;His word a&s;|&s;ures us that he is more ready to pardon &s;inners who repent, and return to him with their whole heart, than they are to a&s;k forgivene&s;s of him, or than he is to puni&s;h tho&s;e who have long de&s;erved his di&s;plea&s;ure. And hence it is, that he &s;o compa&s;&s;ionately invites and per&s;uades us to return to him; for he gains nothing by our doing &s;o, except it be an opportunity to &s;how the exceeding riches of his grace to tho&s;e, whom the &s;word of his ju&s;tice might have cut off, and utterly de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>LET me particularly remind you of a few of the&s;e his merciful offers of pardon to tho&s;e who repent, and turn their feet un|to his te&s;timonies. Thus in the prophecy of Ezekiel, chap. XVIII.&mdash;
<Q>If the wicked will turn from all his &s;ins that he hath committed, and keep all my &s;tatutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he &s;hall &s;urely live, he &s;hall not die. All his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions that he hath com|mitted,
<PB N="37" REF="008667_0042_102fadc2c6dabed8">
they &s;hall not be mentioned un|to him: in his righteou&s;ne&s;s that he hath done, he &s;hall live. Have I any plea|&s;ure at all that the wicked &s;hould die? &s;aith the Lord God: and not that he &s;hould return from his ways and live?</Q>
And afterwards in the &s;ame chapter,
<Q>Be|cau&s;e he con&s;idereth, and turneth away from all his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions that he hath committed, he &s;hall &s;urely live, he &s;hall not die&mdash;Repent, and turn your&s;elves from all your tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; &s;o iniquity &s;hall not be your ruin. Ca&s;t away from you all your tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, whereby ye have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, and make you a new heart, and a new &s;pirit; for why will ye die, O hou&s;e of I&s;rael? For I have no plea&s;ure in the death of him that dieth, &s;aith the Lord God: wherefore turn your&s;elves, and live ye!</Q>
And be|cau&s;e tho&s;e who&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions have been multiplied, of a very heinous, aggravated nature, and long continued in, are &s;ome|times apt to de&s;pond, thinking that God's mercy cannot be extended to them; he has taken particular care to a&s;&s;ure us, that the greatne&s;s of our crimes, and of our guilt, &s;hall be no bar to our finding a gracious reception with him, provided we heartily turn from our &s;ins, and work righteou&s;ne&s;s. Thus, particularly in the
<PB N="38" REF="008667_0043_102fadc726d33d50">
fir&s;t chapter of I&s;aiah, having &s;et forth the &s;ins of his people I&s;rael in the &s;tronge&s;t language, by comparing them to the people of Sodom; and admoni&s;hed them to put away the evil of their doings from before his eyes, he then encourages them to do &s;o, by giving them the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances of his mercy&mdash;
<Q>Come now, and let us rea&s;on together, &s;aith the Lord; tho' your &s;ins be as &s;carlet, they &s;hall be as white as &s;now; th&ocirc; they be red like crim&s;on, they &s;hall be as wool.</Q></P>
<P>NOR is this pardoning mercy of God limited to any particular penitent tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors, to the exclu&s;ion of others who are alike penitent. It overflows upon a whole guilty people, alth&ocirc; in a manner ripe for vengeance and de&s;truction, when|ever there is a thorough and univer&s;al re|formation in it: and this, alth&ograve; God had denounced &s;peedy ruin to it.
<Q>At what in&s;tant,</Q>
&s;ays God by the prophet,
<Q>I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to pull down, and to de&s;troy it; if that nation again&s;t whom I have pronoun|ced, turn from the evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Jerem. XVIII.7, 8.</NOTE></Q>
This declaration, and gracious promi&s;e of God relates, indeed, more imme|diately to his providential di&s;pen&s;ations in
<PB N="39" REF="008667_0044_102fadc8f5fdd6a0">
this world, than to his dealings with people in another: And being con&s;idered in this light, it was remarkably verified in his conduct towards the people of Nineveh, tho' pagans. He had &s;ent his prophet to denounce wrath and de&s;truction again&s;t that great, and very wicked city, even within forty days. But the people re|pented, and proclaimed a fa&s;t; and the king &s;aid,
<Q>Let man and bea&s;t put on &s;ackcloth, and cry mightily unto God; yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we peri&s;h not? <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Jomah III. 7, &mdash;</NOTE></Q>
It follows,
<Q>And God &s;aw their works, that they turned from their evil way, and God repented of the evil that he had &s;aid he would do unto them, and he did it not.</Q>
Thus gracious and long-&s;uffering; thus &s;low to anger and plenteous in mercy; thus ready to forgive iniquity, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in, even the &s;ins of an whole people, upon their repentance, did God both proclaim and manife&s;t him|&s;elf to be; and this, even long before the &s;etting up of that di&s;pen&s;ation in the world, which is more properly called the di&s;pen|&s;ation of his grace.

and &s;ometimes "grace" in the ab&s;tract, as if there were nothing in it but what was compri&s;ed in this term. At other times, it is

<P>AGREEABLE to this general account of the evangelical di&s;pen&s;ation, the new te&s;tament abounds with declarations of God's mercy, and the pardon of &s;in, to all truly humble, penitent, and reformed tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. The&s;e offers are &s;o nume|rous, and &s;o univer&s;ally known, that it &s;eems needle&s;s to produce any particular examples. However, to &s;how you how exceeding ready and willing God is to forgive tho&s;e who return to him; I &s;hall ju&s;t remind you of our Saviour's well-known parable of the prodigal &s;on <NOTE N="h" PLACE="marg">Luk.

This fooli&s;h youth is &s;up|po&s;ed to for&s;ake his father's hou&s;e, where he had bread enough and to &s;pare; and to go into a far di&s;tant country. Here he &s;oon wa&s;tes his &s;ub&s;tance in riotous living; is nece&s;&s;itated to betake him&s;elf to the
<PB N="42" REF="008667_0047_102fadd46cc428c8">
ba&s;e&s;t employments for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and wi&s;hes in vain to &s;atisfy him&s;elf with the hu&s;ks which the &s;wine fed upon. He at length awakes, as it were, out of a long and deep &s;leep; and "comes to him&s;elf." He thinks upon his ways, and ari&s;es to go to his father with that humble and pene|tential confe&s;&s;ion,
<Q>Father, I have &s;inned again&s;t heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy &s;on.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>But when he was yet a great way off, his father &s;aw him, and had compa&s;&s;ion on him, and ran, and fell on his neck, and ki&s;&s;ed him.</Q>
The &s;on then makes his confe&s;&s;ion and acknowledgment, ac|cording to his re&s;olution while he was yet in a far country. But the father, over|joyed at the unexpected return of his &s;on, in&s;tead of upbraiding him with his un|grateful conduct, is concerned only to give him a kind welcome&mdash;
<Q>Bring forth the be&s;t robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his finger, and &s;hoes on his feet. And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat and be merry. For this my &s;on was dead, and is alive again; he was lo&s;t, and is found.</Q>
There cannot, I think, be a &s;tronger, or more affecting repre&s;entation, than our Saviour gives us in this parable, of the great compa&s;&s;ion of God towards

&s;inful men, who at length penitently re|turn to him, how far &s;oever they have gone a&s;tray from him; of his willingne&s;s to meet them upon their return from their wanderings, with the bowels and forgive|ne&s;s of a father; of his rejoicing at an op|portunity to receive them, and to be&s;tow upon them the tokens of his love: For &s;uch

<P>YOU &s;ee then, that if the pardon of our &s;ins is of any value or importance to us, how much it concerns us to turn our feet unto God's te&s;timonies, and to keep his commandments.

<Q>In keeping his commandments there is [now] great reward.</Q>
And godline&s;s is &s;aid to be profitable unto all things,

We are a&s;&s;ured in general, from the holy &s;criptures, that they &s;hall be ble&s;|&s;ed, not only infinitely beyond their de&s;erts, but beyond their pre&s;ent conceptions and wi&s;hes; and thus ble&s;&s;ed forevermore.</P>
<P>NOW I hope I need not &s;pend time to prove to any man in his &s;en&s;es, that it is a thing of importance to him, whether he does, or does not obtain an happine&s;s un|bounded and everla&s;ting; and con&s;equent|ly, whether he does, or does not turn his feet unto God's te&s;timonies; &s;ince we are certain that they only who do the latter, &s;hall enjoy the former. We know that into that thrice glorious kingdom which God has prepared for his friends and fa|vourites, no unclean thing &s;hall enter; neither what&s;oever worketh abomination, or that maketh a lie: but the holy, that do his commandments, the redeemed and ran&s;omed of the Lord, &s;hall a&s;cend, and live, and &s;hine glorious there, with &s;ongs,

If you think it of any importance to you to be|come partakers of &s;uch an happine&s;s as this, i. e. the greate&s;t which God has to be&s;tow, certainly you cannot think it a matter of indifference to you, whether you comply with the terms of it, by repenting of your &s;ins, and turning your feet unto God's te&s;timonies; or finally cut your&s;elves off from it, by per&s;evering in your &s;inful cour&s;es.

<P>LET us now proceed to the fourth and la&s;t thing mentioned for the illu&s;tration of this fir&s;t general head of di&s;cour&s;e; which is,</P>
<P N="4">4^t^h^l^y THE a&s;toni&s;hing method which God has projected for our &s;alvation from the dominion of &s;in, and the puni&s;hment due to it: you know I mean the incar|nation and &s;ufferings, the life and death, of his own dear Son here on earth. This matter being attentively, th&ocirc; but briefly con&s;idered, will &s;et the great importance of turning our feet unto God's te&s;timonies, and keeping his commandments, in a &s;tronger point of light; and give an ad|ditional degree of weight and force to the
<PB N="52" REF="008667_0057_102fadf143817218">
arguments that have been already in&s;i&s;ted on. You are &s;en&s;ible that the particular means or method, by which God offers to deliver us from any evil, whether na|tural or &s;piritual, is of di&s;tinct con&s;idera|tion from that evil it&s;elf. So al&s;o, the particular means or method, by which he offers to confer upon us any good, whe|ther temporal or eternal, is of di&s;tinct con|&s;ideration from the good it&s;elf. It is more|over evident, that the&s;e means and me|thods may be of &s;uch a nature, as great|ly to enhance the favour, and add to the ble&s;&s;ing; or, at lea&s;t, of &s;uch a nature, as to give us a more &s;triking and affecting idea of its worth and importance; and con&s;equently of the importance of our do|ing that which may be requi&s;ite, on our part, in order to render effectual the gra|cious purpo&s;es of heaven towards us.</P>
<P>NOW this is the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the matter under con&s;ideration. It is plainly a thing of great importance to us to turn our feet unto God's te&s;timonies, that we may receive the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and ob|tain eternal life and glory in the kingdom of heaven. But &s;urely the importance hereof appears in a &s;till &s;tronger light to us, when we reflect particularly upon what God has done, in the way of means, in order to bring us to repentance, in or|der
<PB N="53" REF="008667_0058_102fadf2cbbb0570">
to our obtaining forgivene&s;s, and a title to future glory, honor and immorta|lity. That end mu&s;t be of inconceivably great importance to us, for the accom|pli&s;hing of which, God &s;pared not his on|ly begotten Son, but delivered him up for us all; that end, for which the only be|gotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, emptied him&s;elf of his glory in hea|ven, and became incarnate, dwelling a|mong&s;t men in the likene&s;s of &s;inful fle&s;h, and exchanging the form of God for the form of a &s;ervant; that end, for the ac|compli&s;hing of which he, according to the will, and eternal purpo&s;e of God, th&ocirc;t it worth his while to become our in&s;tructor and guide, our monitor and example, af|ter God had rai&s;ed up &s;o many holy men and prophets to preach righteou&s;ne&s;s to the world, and call &s;inners to repentance; that end, for which &s;o glorious a per&s;o|nage as he by whom God created all things, conde&s;cended to undergo &s;o many trials and &s;ufferings for a number of years, in our world and nature, not having where to lay his head, th&ograve; the foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have ne&s;ts: that end, for the accompli&s;hing of which, he not only became a man of &s;orrows, and acquainted with the common griefs which are incident to humanity; but to
<PB N="54" REF="008667_0059_102fadfa303b5dc8">
very peculiar and extraordinary ones, &s;o that there were no griefs in all re&s;pects like to his, whether we con&s;ider the contra|diction of tho&s;e &s;inners whom he came to redeem, which he endured again&s;t him|&s;elf, or tho&s;e temptations and vexations of &s;atan, to which he was &s;ubjected, e&s;pe|cially when his la&s;t &s;ufferings approached; when he was in an agony, and &s;weat as it were great drops of blood, falling from his face to the ground: In fine, that end, for the accompli&s;hing of which he poured out his &s;oul unto death, the accur&s;ed death of the cro&s;s, and was made a cur&s;e for us. That end, for which God gave his Son to do and &s;uffer the&s;e things, and for which he actually did and &s;uffered them, in con&s;e|quence of God's appointment, mu&s;t cer|tainly be an end of &s;uch importance to us, that it is not fully conceivable by us. We know indeed, in general, what the end hereof actually was, namely, that we might be redeemed from all iniquity, from the power and practice of &s;in, from the mi&s;eries of our fallen and corrupt e&s;tate, from the cur&s;e of the law, and become the &s;ons and heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Chri&s;t, "the fir&s;t-born among many brethren," to an incorruptible and hea|venly inheritance. We know in general, not only that this was the end of our
<PB N="55" REF="008667_0060_102fadfbd6d6f450">
Lord's incarnation, &s;ufferings and death; but we can al&s;o &s;ee in &s;ome mea&s;ure, that it highly concerns us that this end &s;hould be finally accompli&s;hed with re&s;pect to us, by our cordially falling in, and co-opera|ting with, this gracious de&s;ign, and mar|vellous di&s;pen&s;ation of providence. But &s;till there is, and mu&s;t be, &s;omewhat here|in which is unfathomable by us: It is a great deep, which we cannot go to the bottom of: It mu&s;t be &s;omewhat of &s;o momentous and intere&s;ting a nature to us, that we cannot have a full and adequate conception of it at pre&s;ent; neither of the greatne&s;s of that mi&s;ery and de&s;truction, to deliver us from which, the Son of God was made manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, lived in &s;orrow, and died upon a cro&s;s; nor yet of the greatne&s;s of that &s;alvation which he came to purcha&s;e for us, and of that glory which is to be revealed in his &s;aints. It is a di&s;pen&s;ation of divine love and grace, which evidently be&s;peaks, or indicates, an end and de&s;ign too big and augu&s;t for our narrow, limited capacities; and indeed the holy angels are repre&s;ented as prying into it with wonder and admiration.</P>
<P>WE can hardly conceive of an end great enough, a de&s;ign really worthy of &s;uch an extraordinary interpo&s;ition of providence: We can hardly imagine our|&s;elves,
<PB N="56" REF="008667_0061_102fadfdae3fa538">
or any thing which relates to us poor mortals, of &s;uch importance in the creation of God, that it would be worth while (to &s;peak after the manner of men) for God to be at &s;o great an expence for us, or for &s;o dignified and glorious a per|&s;on as the Son of God, by whom all things were made and con&s;i&s;t, to come down from heaven, and to &s;uffer death with malefactors upon a cro&s;s. But yet we are &s;ure that all this is in fact true: And what is the con&s;equence from it? I an&s;wer, it is plainly this, that we our&s;elves are of more con&s;equence, and our &s;ouls of more worth than we can well conceive of, or at pre&s;ent imagine: That we do not fully know, either what a terrible de|&s;truction is implied in that death, which is &s;aid to be the "wages of &s;in," or the glory and happine&s;s implied in that eter|nal life with God, which is his
<Q>gift thr&ocirc; Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</Q>
Both the ruin and mi&s;ery of that &s;tate of &s;in and cor|ruption, from which Chri&s;t came to re|deem us, and the bli&s;s and glory of that &s;tate to which he came to conduct us, are great beyond our pre&s;ent comprehen&s;ion. They &s;hun our finite capacities, and are in a &s;ort hidden from us, even by means of their own greatne&s;s. And we may be certain beforehand, if there be a due pro|portion

and analogy among&s;t the works of God; betwixt the di&s;pen&s;ations of his providence towards us in this probatio|nary &s;tate, and what is to &s;ucceed them hereafter, in a &s;tate of retribution, that both the ruin of tho&s;e who per&s;evere in their rebellion again&s;t God's righteous laws and government, and the happi|ne&s;s of tho&s;e who co-operate with the de&s;igns of his grace, &s;hall far &s;urpa&s;s any thing of mi&s;ery upon one hand, and of bli&s;s and glory upon the other, that we can now conceive of by the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of imagination. It was not, &s;urely, to de|liver us from &s;ome incon&s;iderable evil, nor to procure for us an incon&s;iderable good, that the Son of God came into this apo&s;tate world, and liv'd and died therein, in the manner repre&s;ented to us in the holy &s;criptures! Here it is that we &s;ee as far, perhaps, as it is po&s;&s;ible for us to &s;ee at pre&s;ent, the importance of turning our feet unto God's te&s;timonies, and keeping his commandments: We &s;ee the va&s;t im|portance hereof more fully and clearly by contemplating upon the mediation of Chri&s;t, and trying to enlarge our th&ocirc;ts to &s;omething future, that may corre&s;pond to &s;o great an interpo&s;ition of divine provi|dence and grace, than we can, even by contemplating the expre&s;s threatnings and
<PB N="58" REF="008667_0063_102fae06a60c7698">
promi&s;es of God in his word, th&ocirc; &s;o won|derfully calculated to fill us with awful apprehen&s;ions on one hand, and with glo|rious hopes on the other. Unle&s;s we co|operate with the de&s;ign of Chri&s;t's coming into the world, by exerci&s;ing repentance towards God, and faith towards him, and living in obedience to his commandments, we &s;hall not only have no lot or portion hereafter, with them that reap the glorious fruits of his mediation; but &s;uffer the full demerit of our &s;ins, and among&s;t others, that of
<Q>treading under foot the Son of God.</Q>
So that altho' we have now all of us rea&s;on to rejoice, yet we may hereafter have occa&s;ion to lament, that ever there was
<Q>born to us in the city of David, a Saviour, who is Chri&s;t the Lord!</Q>
For certainly it had been far better for us, if God had left us to peri&s;h finally in the ruins of the common apo&s;tacy, than that He &s;hould have been &s;o good and gracious as to offer us, and we &s;o evil and unthank|ful as to reject, &s;o great &s;alvation!</P>
<P>AND thus we have done with the &s;e|veral heads of argument, by which it was propo&s;ed to &s;how, of what va&s;t impor|tance it is to &s;inful men to turn their feet unto God's te&s;timonies, and keep his com|mandments; th&ograve; it is impo&s;&s;ible fully and adequately to repre&s;ent it, or even to con|ceive

Or if thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions be multi|plied, what harm doe&s;t thou unto Him? If thou art righteous, what give&s;t thou Him? or what receiveth He of thine hand? Thy wickedne&s;s may indeed hurt a poor, weak, dependent creature, as thou art; or thy righteou&s;ne&s;s may profit thee, the &s;on or daughter of man; but not Him, before whom all nations are as the &s;mall du&s;t of the balance, and are counted to Him as le&s;s than nothing and vanity. The re&s;ult of all, therefore, is this,&mdash;

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM III.</NOTE>THE great importance of turning our feet unto God's te&s;timonies, and keeping his commandments, has been &s;hown in two preceeding di&s;cour&s;es; and more e&s;pecially from the&s;e con&s;iderations;</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="008667_0070_102fae18a1d6eef0">THE power and greatne&s;s of God, his holine&s;s and univer&s;al dominion, and our ab&s;olute dependence upon him:</P>
<P>THE clear and po&s;itive denunciations of his wrath, in his word, again&s;t all im|penitent, irreclaimable tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors:</P>
<P>THE great and precious promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, made to tho&s;e who turn at God's reproof, and keep his commandments:</P>
<P>And la&s;tly,</P>
<P>THE a&s;toni&s;hing method which God has projected for our &s;alvation from the dominion of &s;in, and the puni&s;hment due to it.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations make it manife&s;t, how greatly it concerns us to break off our &s;ins by repentance, and to walk before God in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, accor|ding to his commandments; which was the fir&s;t general point propo&s;ed, in hand|ling the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. The &s;econd ge|neral head, to which we now proceed, was,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, To &s;how, by a variety of arguments, the va&s;t importance of being &s;peedy in this bu&s;ine&s;s; of making ha&s;te to keep God's commandments; and the ex|treme folly and danger of delaying it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, it is only one argument that will be in&s;i&s;ted upon at pre&s;ent, with this view; which &s;hall be drawn from a
<PB N="66" REF="008667_0071_102fae2069881868">
con&s;ideration of the &s;hortne&s;s of human life, and the uncertain duration of this pro|bationary &s;tate. Divers other arguments will be left to &s;ucceeding di&s;cour&s;es. For I &s;hall choo&s;e to confine my&s;elf to a &s;ingle point in each di&s;cour&s;e, rather than to run the hazard of perplexing and di&s;tracting your minds by too great a variety. And be&s;ides, the arguments which will, by God's leave and help, be in&s;i&s;ted upon, &s;eem to be &s;o weighty and momentous in them|&s;elves, that each of them may well claim a large and di&s;tinct con&s;ideration, by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT may be rea&s;onably pre&s;umed, that you are all in general convinced, that it is both your duty and highe&s;t intere&s;t to turn your feet unto God's te&s;timonies, and to keep his commandments: but po&s;&s;ibly you may not &s;o clearly perceive the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of being &s;peedy herein, as the P&s;al|mi&s;t was, who tells us, that he
<Q>made ha&s;te and delayed not.</Q>
There are ma|ny per&s;ons who will not pretend to deny, but that it is of the la&s;t importance to them to repent of their &s;ins, and reform their lives; who yet cannot be per&s;uaded of the rea&s;onablene&s;s and importance of do|ing this immediately, without any delay; but will be for deferring it to &s;ome future opportunity, which they imagine will be more convenient for them, and an&s;wer the
<PB N="67" REF="008667_0072_102fae226717e388">
end as well in other re&s;pects. It is indeed here, that one of the greate&s;t dangers lies, of mens finally peri&s;hing in their &s;ins: So that when they are convinced of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity and importance of a reformation in general, they are to be &s;hown the ne|ce&s;&s;ity and importance of beginning it without any delay; otherwi&s;e the time may perhaps never come, which &s;uits them in all re&s;pects; and &s;o they will ne|ver be the better for that general con|viction, which they have of the impor|tance of leading a better life.</P>
<P>Now th&ocirc; there were no other argu|ments to inforce a &s;peedy repentance and amendment, be&s;ides that which was ju&s;t mentioned above, the &s;hortne&s;s of human life, and the uncertain continuance of our &s;tate of trial; yet this alone would be ab|&s;olutely conclu&s;ive; &s;o as to convict that per&s;on of the greate&s;t imprudence and madne&s;s, who &s;hould defer the thoughts of returning to God and his duty, a &s;ingle day or hour; &s;ince we know not what a day or hour may bring forth, and the op|portunity which is let &s;lip, and is lo&s;t to day, may be lo&s;t forever! Whenever there is any thing which is in it&s;elf of great im|portance and concernment to us in this world; (if indeed there is any thing here below that can be ju&s;tly accounted &s;o) and
<PB N="68" REF="008667_0073_102fae23f39d1ab0">
when, by neglecting it at pre&s;ent, we may probably mi&s;s of &s;ome great temporal good, or incur &s;ome great temporal evil, and render the damage irretrievable to us; whenever this is the ca&s;e, as to our worldly bu&s;ine&s;s and concernments, it is the plain dictate of rea&s;on and prudence to embrace the pre&s;ent time, and not to let &s;lip the opportunity which we actually have, up|on the di&s;tant and uncertain pro&s;pect of another afterwards. And this is the ge|neral rule and maxim, by which all men that are tolerably wi&s;e and prudent in their temporal affairs, invariably conduct them|&s;elves: for
<Q>the children of this world are in their generation wi&s;er than the children of light;</Q>
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Luke XVI.8.</NOTE> more wary and provident, and more careful to improve their &s;everal opportunities to &s;ecure their worldly advantage, than they who are favoured with &s;piritual privileges, and a &s;pace for repentance, are to
<Q>make their calling and election &s;ure;</Q>
and entitle them&s;elves to eternal life and &s;alvation. Our Saviour takes occa&s;ion to teach us a le&s;&s;on of prudence in our &s;piritual and e|ternal concernments, from the conduct and example of &s;uch children of this world, as neglect not to improve their pre&s;ent opportunities; nor put off 'til to|morrow, that which &s;hould be done to|day.
<PB N="69" REF="008667_0074_102fae25804ce780">
Con&s;ider, therefore, their ways, and be wi&s;e.</P>
<P>THE careful hu&s;bandman ob&s;erves the fir&s;t opening of the &s;pring, and the ad|vancing of the &s;un with his genial warmth: He con&s;iders the approaching &s;ummer, the autumnal &s;ea&s;on, and &s;ub&s;e|quent winter. In the &s;pring he manures, &s;ows and plants his fields; in the &s;ummer he dre&s;&s;es them,
<Q>waiting for the pre|cious fruit of the earth;</Q>
and in autumn he gathers his harve&s;t into barns, that he may have all manner of &s;tore, when the &s;ea&s;on is pa&s;t for that kind of labor, and winter confines him at home. Did you ever know a di&s;crete hu&s;bandman, who did not thus con&s;ider times, &s;ea&s;ons and opportunities; and lay hold upon them as they arrived, le&s;t, letting them &s;lip, he &s;hould be de&s;titute of the means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence? Fools, and &s;lothful men, may indeed be guilty of &s;uch negligence, and only they: And &s;uch are accordingly &s;ent to learn wi&s;dom even of the ant, or pi&s;|mire:
<Q>Go to the ant thou &s;luggard, con|&s;ider her ways, and be wi&s;e: which having no guide, over&s;eer, or ruler, provideth her meat in the &s;ummer, and gathereth her food in the harve&s;t.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Prov. VI 6, 7, 8.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>IF you con&s;ider the di&s;crete mariner, you will find in him the &s;ame care, and
<PB N="70" REF="008667_0075_102fae2d337b0420">
attention to times and opportunities. Knowing that winds, and tides, and wea|ther, will not conform to his inclinations, or wait his plea&s;ure, he prudently con|forms him&s;elf to them, as far as po&s;&s;ible. When the weather is fair, the gale from the proper point, and the tide &s;erves, he weighs anchor, &s;preads his &s;ails, and takes the helm, le&s;t he &s;hould mi&s;s his pa&s;&s;age, and by unnece&s;&s;ary delays, be kept from the country and port for which he is bound.</P>
<P>THE di&s;crete merchant, the object of who&s;e attention is worldly gain and pro|fit, acts in conformity to the &s;ame pruden|tial maxim, of ob&s;erving times and oppor|tunities; which, being once &s;lipped, may never return. Does he not carefully ob|&s;erve the ri&s;e and fall of &s;tocks, and of in|tere&s;t? Does he not diligently inquire into the &s;tate of foreign markets; and into an hundred other things and circum&s;tances, which are in their nature fluctuating and changeable, that, by improving his op|portunities, and the critical time, he may make &s;ure of &s;omething; and promote his intere&s;t to the utmo&s;t? Will he neglect a pre&s;ent favourable opportunity, when he knows not but that delaying a day or two, may not only put it out of his power to make great profit to him&s;elf, but prove ruin|ous
<PB N="71" REF="008667_0076_102fae2ec0953350">
to his fortunes, and reduce him to bank|ruptcy? Certainly a cautious, prudent mer|chant will not be guilty of &s;uch negligence; but improve every fair opportunity that pre&s;ents it&s;elf, while it is in his power.</P>
<P>DOES not every wi&s;e general, or pru|dent commander, act upon the &s;ame prin|ciple? Will &s;uch an one neglect a pre&s;ent advantage again&s;t the enemy, &s;uch a one as almo&s;t &s;ecures &s;ucce&s;s and triumph to him; when he knows not but that his omitting it, may &s;oon give the enemy as great, or a greater advantage again&s;t him|&s;elf; not only &s;natch a victory from him, but prove the occa&s;ion of his being &s;poiled and captivated?</P>
<P>IN &s;hort do not all men in general act upon this &s;ame prudential maxim in their &s;ecular affairs and concernments, even from the ermin'd monarchs, the great warriours and politicians of the earth, down to the cobler upon his &s;tall? You may plainly &s;ee this principle of warine&s;s and caution operating, and exerting it|&s;elf, thr&ocirc; all the various ranks of human life, from the throne to the foot&s;tool; there are no men who are not governed by it in their worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, excepting tho&s;e only, whom all the world agrees to call, either giddy or &s;tupid, &s;lothful or mad. Every individual, that has any pre|tence
<PB N="72" REF="008667_0077_102fae3073ff3010">
to be reckoned knowing in his own proper concerns, and wi&s;e for him&s;elf in this world, is habitually influenced by it. It is the di&s;cernment of times, and the improvement of opportunities, that makes wi&s;e men, and the not ob&s;erving, or neg|lecting them, that makes fools, in all &s;ecular and earthly affairs. Prudent fore|thought is the parent of plenty and pro|&s;perity; delay is the mother of want, &s;hame and wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>APPLY this to your&s;elves in your high|er capacity, and more important intere&s;t, as you &s;tand related to God, and to ano|ther world. Reflect how much more ir|rational and fooli&s;h it is for men to pro|cra&s;tinate in things of a &s;piritual nature, and eternal concernment, than to be di|latory in their worldly concernments. This life is the &s;ea&s;on for planting and cultivating tho&s;e &s;eeds of piety and vir|tue, which may yield us a harve&s;t of the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s; that we may reap immortal felicity, and make provi&s;ion for our&s;elves again&s;t the winter of death that is approaching. We are all mariners, bound to another country to another world; and now is the time to weigh anchor, to &s;pread our &s;ails, and &s;hape our cour&s;e, towards the haven of endle&s;s peace and joy. There is a pearl of great price
<PB N="73" REF="008667_0078_102fae320ba1e3d8">
&s;et before us, which, like wi&s;e merchants, we &s;hould endeavour to make &s;ure of, th&ocirc; at the expence of every thing el&s;e which we po&s;&s;e&s;s; and without u&s;ing any delay, le&s;t the opportunity &s;hould be over for making our&s;elves rich towards God, before we are aware; and we &s;hould be ca&s;t into that pri&s;on, from whence we &s;hall not come out,
<Q>'til we have paid the uttermo&s;t farthing.</Q>
There is vic|tory, and triumph, and an unfading crown of glory in view; obtaining which, we &s;hall be more than conquerors thr&ocirc; him that loved us; and mi&s;&s;ing of which, we &s;hall be far more wretched than cap|tives;&mdash;puni&s;hed as rebels and traitors a|gain&s;t the king of heaven!</P>
<P>SO important is the intere&s;t which we have depending; and all depending upon our making a wi&s;e and diligent improve|ment of this pre&s;ent life; the only oppor|tunity which we have, or may expect, in order to work out our &s;alvation. That this &s;ea&s;on cannot be very long, and that it may po&s;&s;ibly be very &s;hort, we are e|qually certain. The life of man, when protracted to its greate&s;t length, in this period of the world, is but an
<Q>hand|breadth;</Q>
and it is, be&s;ides, every mo|ment uncertain. And whenever it is ter|minated, our time of trial, you know, is
<PB N="74" REF="008667_0079_102fae38deef1528">
over; &s;o that nothing then remains for us, but to
<Q>receive the things done in the body, according to that we have done, whether it be good or evil.</Q>
Can there be any thing more rea&s;onable for us then, than to make ha&s;te? any thing more im|prudent, than delaying to keep God's commandments? Can you think of any negligence of men in their worldly con|cernments, but what is infinitely le&s;s foo|li&s;h and ab&s;urd, than this negligence and delay, which are &s;o common with re&s;pect to religion, and the concerns of eternity? If men are negligent and imprudent in their worldly concernments, there is &s;till a po&s;&s;ibility of retrieving: Sea&s;ons may return; another &s;pring and &s;eed-time to the hu&s;bandman, another wind to the mariner, another lucky opportunity to the merchant, another advantage to the war|rior. But
<Q>the accepted time, and the day of &s;alvation,</Q>
being once over, ne|ver return to the probationer for another world. This life being run out, the time of trial which God has allotted us, is pa&s;t; we know of no other; we are to expect no other. For as it is
<Q>appointed unto men once to die,</Q>
&s;o
<Q>after that is the judgment;</Q>
and God will then
<Q>render to every man according to his deeds.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="008667_0080_102fae3be4732188">AND what now is human life, upon which &s;o much depends? Is it like the con&s;tant &s;un, which burns and &s;hines thr&ocirc; a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years, &s;o that there is no danger of its going out, and leaving us, th&ograve; we &s;hould neglect our proper bu|&s;ine&s;s for the pre&s;ent? Is it not rather like a little meteor, that darts along the &s;ky, and both appears, and is wholly extin|gui&s;hed, in a moment? in the &s;ame breath? Or, to u&s;e a &s;cripture-compari&s;on, is it not like a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vani&s;hes away, al|mo&s;t as &s;oon as the &s;un is ri&s;en? Is it not like the gra&s;s? In the morning it flouri|&s;heth and groweth up; but at noon it is cut down and withereth. Man knoweth not his time; nor what &s;hall be, even on the morrow. If therefore he is wi&s;e, he will make ha&s;te, and not delay to keep God's commandments to day; le&s;t, thr&ocirc; &s;uch negligence, he &s;hould &s;uddenly fall into la&s;ting and irretrievable ruin.</P>
<P>I WILL not now a&s;k you, where your fathers are, or whether the prophets live for ever? But let me a&s;k you, Where are many of your cotemporaries? Where are many of your friends and acquaintance, who made their appearance upon the &s;tage of this life, about the &s;ame time that you did your&s;elves? Are they all living?
<PB N="76" REF="008667_0081_102fae3dc3646c68">

Yea, I may a&s;k you, Where are many that are younger than you? that were born &s;eve|ral years after you? Are they all &s;till a|live? Are they all &s;till probationers for their eternal &s;tate? Or is not that &s;tate al|ready fixed with re&s;pect to divers of tho&s;e, who entered upon their &s;tate of trial &s;ome years after you?

Alas! are not &s;ome of tho&s;e, who were br&ocirc;t into the world by you, un|der God the common parent, gone out of it before you, leaving you to mourn their untimely exit! It may be further enquired, Where are many that were not only much younger than you, but al&s;o, once, more healthy, &s;trong and vigorous? of firmer nerves and &s;inews? of more robu&s;t con&s;titutions? and who were therefore, according to human rules of probability,

Did they all langui&s;h away by &s;uch &s;low degrees, and die &s;uch a lingering death, as gave them, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, fair warning to pre|pare for it, by making their peace with God, and &s;ettling their accounts with hea|ven? &s;o that after they were unable to walk the earth, they might turn their feet un|to God's te&s;timonies, and run the way of his commandments? What! Were none of them &s;uddenly &s;natched away, as in a moment, by &s;ome violent, rapid di&s;ea&s;e, which had no &s;ooner &s;eized, than it de|&s;troyed them? or, at lea&s;t, took from them

while for this world. What di&s;tre&s;s are they in? how &s;orry for their pa&s;t &s;ins? how anxious about futurity? how re&s;olved do they &s;eem to be, that they will u&s;e the&s;e &s;hort remains of life to the be&s;t advantage; and not trifle away another moment?</P>
<P>Now if you con&s;ider the matter atten|tively, you will plainly &s;ee, that you have more rea&s;on to make ha&s;te, and not delay to keep God's commandments, than if you were &s;ure you had one month, and no longer to live. For, as the ca&s;e now &s;tands with you, you are not certain of another month; nor even of another hour. You may indeed think it probable that you may live &s;everal years; but &s;ince it is po&s;&s;ible you may be di&s;appointed, and that this day is your la&s;t; &s;ince it is po&s;&s;ible your probationary &s;tate may end before the evening; and if it &s;hould, your op|portunity is entirely over, as much as it would be, if you now &s;aw the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, or &s;itting upon the throne of his glory, to judge the world; &s;ince your lives are &s;o uncertain, and the&s;e things are thus, I &s;ay, it is evi|dent that you have a louder call to make ha&s;te in your preparation for death; and that it is more unrea&s;onable and ha|zardous for you to delay it another day, than if you was certain you had one

month, and no longer to live. Why then, I be&s;eech you, will you live as carele&s;ly, as negligently of your eternal intere&s;t, as if you was &s;ure of many years to come; and that future opportunites would not be wanting, wherein to do that nece&s;&s;ary and mo&s;t important work, which you leave undone at pre&s;ent? You are &s;en&s;ible that you are undone, and your &s;ouls lo&s;t forever, if you do not turn your feet un|to God's te&s;timonies, and learn to keep his commandments, before your lives, and this &s;tate of trial, are ended. And &s;ince you have only a di&s;tant, and very uncer|tain pro&s;pect of any future opportunity, whether it be many years hence, or only one, or but a &s;ingle month; how de&s;pe|rate is the hazard which you run by your pre&s;ent delay? Or what is there in this world that &s;hould tempt you thus to put off, and defer from time to time, the one thing needful!</P>
<P>WE may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that by far the greater part of tho&s;e who die in their &s;ins under the light, and in a &s;pecu|lative belief of the go&s;pel, had &s;ome &s;en&s;e of the great importance of religion; that they had at times &s;ome checks and remor&s;e of con&s;cience; &s;ome de&s;ire to e&s;cape the condemnation of the wicked, and to ob|tain eternal life; and accordingly, that
<PB N="83" REF="008667_0088_102fae5738afeac8">
they frequently re&s;olved with them&s;elves, that they would, &s;ome time or other, break off their wicked lives, and turn their feet unto God's te&s;timonies. Yea, 'tis probable there is hardly one of the&s;e &s;inners, among&s;t that wretched multitude, who are now lamenting their wickedne&s;s and impenitence in the regions of woe, but what had often re&s;olved thus with him&s;elf, upon occa&s;ion of &s;ome alarming providences, &s;ome pathetic di&s;cour&s;es, or reading or hearing the promi&s;es and threat|nings of God in his holy word, which is &s;o quick, and powerful, and piercing, at times, even to the hearts of very wicked men. But, alas! death overtook them be|fore the time actually came, which &s;uited them to &s;et about this bu&s;ine&s;s of reforma|tion in earne&s;t. They determined, per|haps, that they would do it five, ten, or twenty years hence; but to be &s;ure, be|fore their time of trial was elap&s;ed. Their &s;ins and lu&s;ts were &s;o dear to them, and their pre&s;umption upon many years to come, was &s;o &s;trong, that it &s;eemed, not only very hard and mortifying, but in &s;ome mea&s;ure unnece&s;&s;ary al&s;o, to break off from them at pre&s;ent, and make ha&s;te to keep God's commandments. This &s;ee|med to them like &s;eparating choice friends, the friends of their bo&s;om; th&ocirc;, in reality,
<PB N="84" REF="008667_0089_102fae58f7f0ffc8">
only the poi&s;onous a&s;ps therein, which were unperceived &s;tinging and wounding them to death. Thus it is that wicked and fooli&s;h men go on, hugging and cheri&s;h|ing their lu&s;ts; and violating the known, plain commandments of God, from on|time to another: and yet, with a &s;trange mixture of faith and infidelity, of con&s;ci|ence and no con&s;cience, of piety and im|piety, of love to this world and regard to another, of concern for their &s;ouls and neg|ligence of them, hypocritically re&s;olving that they will not be wicked always, th&ocirc; fully determined to be &s;o at pre&s;ent. They imagine they have time enough before them; and God forbid that they &s;hould always live that wicked life, and die in their &s;ins at la&s;t! They have &s;ome favorite folly or vanity, to which, having &s;acrifi|ced a little longer, they will piou&s;ly con|&s;ecrate the remainder of their days to the &s;ervice of God, and &s;ecure the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls. They have either bought a piece of ground, or a yoke of oxen, or married a wife, or are building, or taking their &s;wing at youthful plea&s;ures; &s;o that they beg to be excu&s;ed ju&s;t now; but will be &s;ure not to let death overtake them un|prepared, the thought of which they can|not endure. And what is the con&s;equence of the&s;e delays and procra&s;tinations?
<PB N="85" REF="008667_0090_102fae5a824ab738">
of pre&s;uming thus upon &s;eeing many days, and having time enough in &s;tore to do that, which ought to be done immedi|ately, while it is called to-day? I will tell you plainly what it is, becau&s;e it may, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, prove a &s;alutary warning to you, and the means of exci|ting you to improve your pre&s;ent oppor|tunity. The con&s;equence is, that the&s;e fooli&s;h, pre&s;uming &s;inners are damned, before they really conceived them&s;elves to be in any great danger of damnation. I do not mean that this is always, and u|niver&s;ally, but very often the con&s;equence, of &s;uch dilatory pre&s;umption. Some men doubtle&s;s live to repent, according to their hopes and expectations, thr&ocirc; God's good|ne&s;s, forbearance, and long-&s;uffering to|wards them. But many are &s;natched a|way in the mid&s;t of their fond pre&s;umpti|on, and vain imaginations; having no other opportunity for repentance, be&s;ides that &s;ea&s;on which they thought too &s;oon, and therefore neglected. And this is &s;o frequently the fatal con&s;equence of letting &s;lip the time actually pre&s;ent, that the con&s;ideration hereof may well alarm every &s;inner; and excite him to make ha&s;te to keep God's commandments, le&s;t he him&s;elf &s;hould be another &s;ad example, how dangerous it is to delay it!</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="008667_0091_102fae5c172892d8">A MAN who is thor&ocirc;ly and properly &s;en&s;ible of the hazard he runs by delaying to turn his feet unto God's te&s;timonies; of the danger he is really in, every mo|ment of his delay, of being undone for|ever; cannot u&s;e any delay in this mat|ter, con&s;i&s;tently with the known princi|ples of human nature, and the motives by which men are influenced to action: Which makes it proper and nece&s;&s;ary par|ticularly to inculcate a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of this their danger upon them. If men either di&s;believe the great and fundamental doc|trines of religion, re&s;pecting future re|wards and puni&s;hments, and the nece&s;&s;i|ty of a pious and holy life; or, if believ|ing the&s;e things, they confidently depend upon living long, and having time enough to repent and amend hereafter; upon ei|ther of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions it is ea&s;y to con|ceive it po&s;&s;ible for them to per&s;evere in their wicked cour&s;es; and indeed it is improbable that they &s;hould do otherwi&s;e.

The man who &s;ees but an hand's or hair's-breadth, as it were, betwixt him&s;elf and eternal perdition, (as all wicked men who believe the &s;criptures would do, if they had a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the uncertainty of their lives) will &s;urely ne|ver rea&s;on thus ab&s;urdly in his heart:
<Q>When I am &s;ome months or years ol|der; when I have fini&s;hed the worldly &s;chemes I am now &s;o deeply engaged in; when I have taken my fill of &s;en|&s;ual delights; when I have di&s;obeyed, affronted and di&s;honored God, by in|dulging my lu&s;ts a while longer, then will I make all up with him by turning my feet unto his te&s;timonies, and keep|ing his commandments; &s;o that I &s;hall &s;ecure my &s;alvation effectually, without foregoing my pre&s;ent &s;inful plea&s;ures. I can &s;in with &s;afety to my&s;elf for a while; and be wi&s;e, and pious, and virtuous, &s;ome time hence, when my life is drawing near to a period.</Q>
How ab&s;urd and &s;en&s;ele&s;s would &s;uch rea&s;oning be, if it could be called rea&s;oning? how unnatural in the mouth or heart of a &s;in|ner, who had any proper &s;en&s;e of human frailty, the precariou&s;ne&s;s of his life, and the con&s;equence of death to tho&s;e, whom it finds unprepared!

No, &s;urely: The language of a &s;inner's heart, awakened into a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the &s;hortne&s;s and uncertainty of human life, and the con&s;equences of death, will be of a quite contrary &s;train:
<Q>I have far too often tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed God's com|mandments already; I have ri&s;qued my &s;oul far too long. How fooli&s;h and bru|ti&s;h have I been! O my God! what have I been doing! How have I been provoking thy ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure! I am a monument of thy mercy, forbearance and long-&s;uffering. I will no longer tempt thy vengeance, and hazard the lo&s;s of my &s;oul: I have done iniquity; I will do &s;o no more.

O my God, help me to put the&s;e my pre&s;ent re&s;olutions into practice; and pre&s;erve me from that great and mo&s;t dangerous folly of deferring my repen|tance to another day!</Q></P>
<P>THIS, or the like, will ever be the language of that man's heart, who truly believes the great doctrines of religion, who duly con&s;iders how much depends
<PB N="90" REF="008667_0095_102fae70e37ecac0">
upon turning his feet unto God's te&s;timo|nies, and how &s;hort, how very uncer|tain the time is, which is alotted him for that end. It is not &s;uppo&s;eable that &s;uch a man &s;hould think of delaying a &s;ingle day to make his peace with God; to &s;eek an intere&s;t in his favour, thr&ograve; him that came to &s;eek and &s;ave that which was lo&s;t; and to &s;ecure him&s;elf again&s;t the terrible effects of his righteous di&s;plea&s;ure. You might as well &s;uppo&s;e that a man would, with his eyes open, precipitate him&s;elf in|to the &s;ea, or leap headlong into the fire, as that &s;uch a per&s;on would per&s;evere in the indulgence of tho&s;e lu&s;ts, which drown men in de&s;truction and perdition; or in perpetrating tho&s;e crimes, for which he knows he may &s;uddenly be ca&s;t into hell, where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched!</P>
<P>AND hence it plainly follows, that what|ever tho&s;e men may pretend, who go on from year to year in the gratification of their &s;inful lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, they do not give a full and firm a&s;&s;ent to the impor|tant doctrines of religion, more e&s;pecially tho&s;e re&s;pecting a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, or el&s;e they have not a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their frailty, the uncertainty of their lives, and the time of their proba|tion. Either they have &s;ome doubts re|maining
<PB N="91" REF="008667_0096_102fae72c12ca8c0">
upon their minds, re&s;pecting the truth of what religion teaches concerning the perfections and moral government of God, and the con&s;equences of death to the righteous and wicked re&s;pectively; or, if they really and fully believe the&s;e things, they are not duly apprehen&s;ive how &s;hort and precarious their time here is, but mo&s;t fondly and fooli&s;hly pre&s;ume upon that as certain, than which nothing is le&s;s &s;o, viz. that they &s;hall have an opportu|nity to repent and reform hereafter. One or the other of the&s;e mu&s;t needs be the ca&s;e: There is no po&s;&s;ibility of account|ing for their conduct, in delaying to turn their feet unto God's te&s;timonies, in any other way, without contradicting the known principles of human nature, and the motives upon which men con&s;tantly act in all other matters of importance to them. The former &s;uppo&s;ition may pro|bably be the truth as to &s;ome wicked men, even among&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of religion; and the latter as to others. Some, per|haps, may not really believe tho&s;e great and fundamental articles of religion, which they profe&s;s; but profe&s;s them on|ly for form and fa&s;hion &s;ake, to avoid the appearance of &s;ingularity. It is ea&s;y to account for the conduct of &s;uch. But there may be others who really believe
<PB N="92" REF="008667_0097_102fae749a84a2a0">
the&s;e doctrines, and are per&s;uaded in their own minds, that their eternal well-being depends upon turning to God, and keep|ing his commandments, during the pre&s;ent life; who have yet never once thought &s;eriou&s;ly and ju&s;tly of the uncertainty of life; who have never learnt, with their other arithmetic, to number their days a|right; nor duly con&s;idered the hazard of delaying, on a pre&s;umption that the pe|riod of their lives is far di&s;tant.</P>
<P>NOW whatever may be the rea&s;on why other per&s;ons neglect to return to God, the more immediate cau&s;e why the&s;e lat|ter defer their repentance, is, becau&s;e they thus put far away the time of their death, and thus flatter them&s;elves with future opportunities of amendment. And you are &s;en&s;ible that my &s;ubject, and the main argument and de&s;ign of this di&s;cour&s;e, lead me more particularly to guard you again&s;t this error, &s;o natural, and almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary a cau&s;e, of &s;ecurity in &s;in. It is probable that this is a very common, if not the mo&s;t general and fatal delu&s;ion, which people who believe the go&s;pel, fall into; and which keeps &s;inners from turn|ing their feet unto God's te&s;timonies without delay. The devil is too know|ing to tempt men to go on in their &s;ins with their eyes wide open, and while they

clearly di&s;cern the danger of it; he knows this would be to little purpo&s;e. The great adver&s;ary of our &s;ouls, of who&s;e devices we &s;hould not be ignorant, therefore de|ludes people into this notion, that their lives are not &s;o very precarious as is pre|tended; that they may, and probably will, live long; that they need not be in ha&s;te; that there is no great danger of delaying a little longer, and enjoying the plea&s;ures of &s;in: And that after they have indulged their lu&s;ts a few years more, then they may repent, and work out their &s;alvation, and do it with double diligence.</P>
<P>I CALL this a delu&s;ion of the devil, not only becau&s;e all vain and fal&s;e imagina|tions in general, which tend to make men quiet in their &s;ins, are a&s;cribed to him in &s;cripture; but al&s;o becau&s;e it is in it|&s;elf hardly po&s;&s;ible that men &s;hould be de|luded in this manner, and run into &s;uch a gro&s;s mi&s;take, unle&s;s they were under &s;ome &s;trange infatuation; unle&s;s, in &s;hort, they were in fact blinded and bewitch'd by that evil &s;pirit, that worketh in the children of di&s;obedience. For what &s;inner could pre&s;ume thus upon future opportunities, and on that fooli&s;h pre&s;umption make him&s;elf ea&s;y, and think his condition &s;afe, were he not under the influence of &s;ome &s;pirit even wor&s;e than his own, that de|priv'd

<P>LET me therefore endeavour to re&s;cue mi&s;erable, mortal &s;inners, out of the &s;nare of the evil one, by impre&s;&s;ing this plain, but u&s;eful &s;entiment upon their hearts, that it may be written there as with a pen of iron and the point of a diamond, as their &s;ins are written in the book of God's remembrance; this &s;entiment, I mean, that their lives are every moment uncer|tain. You can have no dependence up|on any future &s;ea&s;on, if you neglect the pre&s;ent, for turning to God, and &s;ecuring that great &s;alvation which is revealed in the go&s;pel. In the language of &s;cripture, NOW is the accepted time, and NOW is the day of &s;alvation. It is unrea&s;onable to allot upon that time which may never be yours, even in things of little moment: but to allot and rely upon it in a matter of infinite and eternal concernment, and when, if you &s;hould happen to be di&s;ap|pointed, you will be undone forever, this is &s;uch &s;otti&s;hne&s;s and infatuation as can|not

One would think that the word of God him&s;elf, wherein we are &s;o frequently reminded of the uncer|tainty of our lives, and admoni&s;hed not to "boa&s;t our&s;elves of to-morrow," might be &s;ufficient to reclaim us from this folly; and to make us con&s;tantly look upon our&s;elves as dying men, even th&ocirc; there were no other argument to convince us.

<P><PB N="98" REF="008667_0103_102fae81b8d368b8">WHAT do your rea&s;on and con&s;ciences an&s;wer to the&s;e plain, but very &s;erious and important que&s;tions? But indeed I need not a&s;k you what an&s;wer they make: for I know what it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be, if you under&s;tand the que&s;tions, and the ground of them. It mu&s;t needs be, that it is the height of imprudence and madne&s;s to defer your repentance a day, or hour longer; that you will forfeit all ju&s;t pre|tentions to di&s;crete and wi&s;e conduct, if you do not make ha&s;te to keep God's commandments; &s;ince you have &s;o great an intere&s;t that depends upon your doing it before this life, which is &s;o very preca|rious, is brought to a conclu&s;ion. It is impo&s;&s;ible but that your under&s;tandings &s;hould be convinced of the&s;e things; and God grant that your hearts may be di&s;|po&s;ed to follow their dictates!</P>
<P>THE argument which has been in&s;i&s;ted upon in this di&s;cour&s;e, you are &s;en&s;ible, is drawn wholly from a con&s;ideration of the &s;hortne&s;s and uncertainty of that &s;pace which God allows us for repentance, and working out our &s;alvation. If I &s;hould live to preach, and you to hear, any more di&s;cour&s;es upon this &s;ubject, you may ex|pect to hear &s;ome other arguments, tending to &s;how you the importance of acting the &s;ame part which the P&s;almi&s;t did, who
<PB N="99" REF="008667_0104_102fae8353e3ef28">
tells us that he made ha&s;te, and delayed not to keep the commandments of God.</P>
<P>TO conclude for the pre&s;ent; Let me be&s;eech you, as you value your &s;ouls, &s;e|riou&s;ly to con&s;ider, and keep in your re|membrance, that argument which has now been improved to quicken you to your duty. Fix it in your thoughts, that this world is not your home; that you are &s;trangers and pilgrims in the earth, as all your fathers were; that you are ha&s;tening to an eternal &s;tate, a &s;tate of righteous retribution; that you can have no dependence upon to-morrow; that you may be in another world before you hear another &s;ermon, yea before you get to your own hou&s;es from the hou&s;e of God, where the preca|riou&s;ne&s;s of life has been repre&s;ented to you. However you may triumph in the thoughts of your youth, health or &s;trength, you have, believe it, all a mor|tal di&s;temper now upon you; you are in a con&s;umption; the &s;eeds and the &s;en|tence of death is within you; it cannot be long before, and it may be very &s;oon that, you will go to the hou&s;e appointed for all the living. Watch therefore, and endeavour to be prepared for your great change; for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein it will come upon you.
<PB N="100" REF="008667_0105_102fae8bc0686690">
Whenever it comes, you will be &s;en&s;ible, that as but one thing is needful, &s;o that claims the fir&s;t and la&s;t attention of man; and that all other cares, be&s;ides that of the &s;oul, are foreign from his true intere&s;t, and therefore little better than mere tri|fling. One might be confident, that a man who believes the &s;criptures, and has a due &s;en&s;e of life's uncertainty, cannot go on from year to year, in the known, wilful violation of God's commandments, or delay to turn his feet unto his te&s;timo|nies. A man mu&s;t almo&s;t forget that he is mortal, to be &s;ure forget that he is eve|ry hour liable to death and its con&s;e|quences, before he can be ea&s;y in his &s;ins. While he keeps death and eternal judg|ment in view, and con&s;iders how &s;oon and &s;uddenly he may be called out of the world to receive his recompence, he will of cour&s;e be con&s;trained to live to God, who giveth unto all, life and breath and all things; and upon whom all intirely depend. So that there can hardly be a prayer more proper for mortal man to put up to the immortal, invi&s;ible and eternal God, than that of the P&s;almi&s;t, with which I conclude; and which each one of us &s;hould make with &s;incerity and fervor, as he did, while we are mu&s;ing, and the fire burns;&mdash;

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM IV.</NOTE>THE rea&s;onablene&s;s and importance of making ha&s;te to keep God's commandments, was &s;hown in the la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e upon this &s;ubject, from
<PB N="103" REF="008667_0108_102fae91c9d5bef8">
a con&s;ideration of the &s;hortne&s;s of human life, and the uncertain duration of this probationary &s;tate. It was then intima|ted to you, that &s;ome other arguments would, by God's leave and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, be in&s;i&s;ted upon, in order to quicken you in your return to him, and to &s;how you the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of delay in this matter. Accordingly I intend, in this di&s;cour&s;e, to handle another argument with the &s;ame general de&s;ign of exciting you to a &s;peedy repentance, and reformation of your lives; th&ocirc; the argument will be quite different in kind from the former.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent argument, then, &s;hall be drawn from a con&s;ideration of the greater ea&s;e of reforming now, without delay, than there will be hereafter, if we put off this nece&s;&s;ary and important work to a|nother &s;ea&s;on, th&ocirc; we were &s;ure of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aving another, as we are not. Taking it for granted that you have as many years cer|tainly to come, as you may perhaps pre|&s;ume upon, th&ocirc; nothing is le&s;s certain; yet if by delaying your return to God, you will render &s;till more difficult, what &s;eems &s;o difficult and irk&s;ome to you at pre&s;ent, it is plainly the dictate of wi&s;dom and prudence to make ha&s;te, and not to defer it to another time.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="008667_0109_102fae98754c97a0">WHEN any thing, be it what it will, is of great importance and nece&s;&s;ity to be done by us &s;ome time or other, which will be attended with difficulty, and re|quire much pains and labor, whenever it is done; and when delaying it will cer|tainly, or only probably, increa&s;e the difficulty, this is a plain rea&s;on why we &s;hould immediately apply our&s;elves to the doing of it, without the lo&s;s of any time. There would be &s;ome plau&s;ible excu&s;e, yea, in many ca&s;es a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for delay, provided the particular bu&s;ine&s;s be|fore us would grow ea&s;ier and ea&s;ier up|on our hands, the longer it was deferred; provided that which at pre&s;ent requires great pains and &s;elf-denial, care and watchfulne&s;s, would require little or none &s;ome years hence. In many affairs of a worldly nature, th&ocirc; not in all univer&s;ally, this would fully ju&s;tify a delay, and even make it the part of wi&s;dom. But where the rever&s;e of this is true; where the difficulty will be made greater by pro|cra&s;tination, it is evidently mo&s;t rea&s;onable for us immediately to apply our&s;elves to the work before us; that &s;o we may &s;ave our&s;elves that additional degree of toil, trouble and vexation, which will be the certain, or at lea&s;t probable con&s;e|quence of delay.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="008667_0110_102fae9a3064dae0">THE general rule or maxim here laid down, is indi&s;putably true, and univer&s;al|ly acknowledged by men in their &s;ecular concernments. All men, excepting only the fooli&s;h, &s;lothful and improvident, both acknowledge it true in &s;peculation, and act according to it, in their worldly affairs. Does not every man, who is but tolerably wi&s;e and prudent in the management of his affairs, &s;tudy and contrive, and exert him&s;elf, to di&s;patch them with all &s;peed, when it is either certain, or highly pro|bable, that delays will create new diffi|culties and ob&s;tructions to the accompli&s;h|ing his de&s;igns? when he knows that what is hard to be executed at pre&s;ent, will, in all likelihood, become &s;till the harder, the longer it is deferred? Do not all men of all ranks, profe&s;&s;ions and &s;tations in life, rea&s;on thus, and act upon this prin|ciple; except only the fooli&s;h, negligent and &s;lothful, as was intimated before? Shew me, if you can, any of tho&s;e chil|dren of this world, who can be called wi&s;e in their generation, or di&s;crete in the conduct of their temporal affairs, who do not govern them&s;elves by this rule. You can &s;hew me none, who do not. And &s;hould not we, who are called to the kingdom and glory of God, be as careful, prudent and provident in the concerns of
<PB N="106" REF="008667_0111_102fae9c0d372dc0">
our &s;ouls, and eternal intere&s;t, as the men of the world generally are in their tempo|ral concerns? Or rather, &s;hould we not be more wary, more circum&s;pect, more diligent, more &s;tudious to embrace the fitte&s;t opportunity for working out our &s;alvation, than they are to compa&s;s their worldly de&s;igns and projects? Certainly we &s;hould be &s;o, by how more important and nece&s;&s;ary this bu&s;ine&s;s is to us, than the former is to them. We &s;hould take heed le&s;t, by any delay, we render this mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary work of amending our hearts and manners, more difficult and irk&s;ome than it would be, if we engaged in it immediately, as we &s;hall doubtle&s;s do, if we delay it at all.</P>
<P>BUT let me be a little more particular in &s;tating and urging this argument for making ha&s;te to keep the command|ments of God. And here, allowing all that could be de&s;ired, and indeed much more than is true, viz, that wicked men might depend upon many years to come, and be certain of a future &s;ea&s;on for repen|tance, th&ograve; they neglect the pre&s;ent; yet e|ven upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, I &s;ay, it would be their wi&s;dom immediately to apply them|&s;elves to the nece&s;&s;ary work of reforma|tion, becau&s;e deferring it will render it the more irk&s;ome and difficult, and co&s;t
<PB N="107" REF="008667_0112_102fae9f1e82a370">
them the more pains in accompli&s;hing it at la&s;t. This argument con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;e|veral parts following, which, for the &s;ake of clearne&s;s, it will be proper to con&s;ider di&s;tinctly: viz.</P>
<P>THAT for wicked men to reform their hearts and ways, and turn their feet unto God's te&s;timonies, is a work of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to them:</P>
<P>THAT it will be attended with difficul|ty and &s;elf-denial, how &s;oon &s;oever it is engaged in:</P>
<P>THAT it will become &s;till more difficult by being delayed: And, therefore,</P>
<P>THAT it highly concerns them to en|gage in it immediately; to make ha&s;te, and not delay to keep God's command|ments.&mdash;Of each of the&s;e particulars in its order, as the time will allow.</P>
<P>IT was ob&s;erved then, as the ground|work of the pre&s;ent argument, and what is to be taken along with us thr&ograve;out, That for wicked men to reform their hearts and ways, and turn their feet unto God's te&s;|timonies, is a work of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to them. By which is meant, that they are intirely undone and lo&s;t, if they do it not, and happy forever if they do it. There are many things, which a man may either do or forbear, without any con&s;i|derable advantage to him upon one hand,
<PB N="108" REF="008667_0113_102faea3ed70dfa0">
or di&s;advantage upon the other. But here, the gain and the lo&s;s are both of them beyond compari&s;on or computation, being both infinite. This is a work which, if we perform it in the day of our vi&s;ita|tion, will gain us the favour of almighty God, will in&s;ure the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls, and a glorious, incorruptible inheri|tance in the kingdom of heaven; &s;o that whatever el&s;e we may neglect, yet if we do this, we &s;hall be happy forever, happy beyond all our pre&s;ent ideas and concep|tions. On the other hand, if we leave this undone, and die in our &s;ins, we &s;hall incur the wrath of God, we &s;hall lo&s;e our &s;ouls, and have our portion with the de|vil and his angels in outer darkne&s;s; &s;o that whatever el&s;e we may do, yet if we neglect this, we &s;hall be wretched forever, wretched beyond all that we can conceive of wretchedne&s;s at pre&s;ent. How ne|ce&s;&s;ary a work then, mu&s;t that be, upon the performance or neglect of which, &s;o much depends! In our worldly affairs, we frequently think and &s;peak of this and the other thing as nece&s;&s;ary, which are by no means &s;o, the con&s;equences of doing or omitting them, not being very material to us one way or the other. But this is truly nece&s;&s;ary; becau&s;e our great and e|ternal intere&s;t is in&s;eparably connected
<PB N="109" REF="008667_0114_102faea74b65b1b0">
with, and depends upon it. And indeed all that was &s;aid in the two fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;es upon this &s;ubject, concerning the impor|tance of turning our feet unto God's te&s;ti|monies, is a proof of the great and ab|&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of this work, in the &s;en&s;e of the term nece&s;&s;ity, as here u&s;ed: So that there is no occa&s;ion for enlarging any farther here, upon this point.</P>
<P>IT was ob&s;erved in the next place, That this work will be attended with difficulty and &s;elf-denial, how &s;oon &s;oever it is en|gaged in. To correct the temper and manners, to break off a vicious cour&s;e of life, and enter the paths of righteou&s;ne&s;s, will at any time require great re&s;olution, and co&s;t t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> penitent much pains. Even before the fle&s;h, the world and the devil, have e&s;tabli&s;hed their empire over a man in its full &s;trength and power, it is no ea&s;y thing to conquer them, and throw off their oppre&s;&s;ive yoke. There will be many a &s;truggle betwixt the fle&s;h and the &s;pirit; there mu&s;t be many a conflict for the dominion over us, betwixt the world in which we live, and that world which faith di&s;covers to us; there will be many a &s;trife and conte&s;t betwixt con&s;cience and the evil &s;pirit that worketh in the children of di&s;obedience, before you will fully re|cover and e&s;tabli&s;h your moral liberty,
<PB N="110" REF="008667_0115_102faea90c291150">
and get into a fixed habit of piety, and obedience to God's commandments. I would not therefore by any means flatter you with the thought, that you will not meet with difficulties, with many di&s;cou|ragements, with much hard labor, and have occa&s;ion to exerci&s;e great &s;elf-denial, 'ere you accompli&s;h a thorough reforma|tion in your&s;elves, and become indeed the &s;ervants of God and righteou&s;ne&s;s. This would be to &s;peak wickedly for God, and to deceive you to your hurt; whereas it is my duty to forewarn you truly of what you are to expect, that you may &s;it down and count the co&s;t, and be the better pre|pared to encounter the difficulties that may ari&s;e in your way. The&s;e will pro|bably be &s;o many and great, that you will often be ready to de&s;pond, thinking them un&s;urmountable; and that th&ocirc; you &s;hould &s;truggle for a while, yet you mu&s;t finally be overcome, and fall by the hands of your &s;piritual enemies. This is what you are to expect, in turning your feet unto God's te&s;timonies, how much ha&s;te &s;oever you may make to do it, and how re&s;olutely &s;oever you may begin. You will find numerous temp|tations to overcome, which will require all your fortitude and &s;trength, and with|out them, will prove too hard for you.
<PB N="111" REF="008667_0116_102faeadb53ce418">
You will have &s;nares laid in your way, &s;o that you will &s;ometimes be &s;urpri&s;ed into &s;in, and caught by the wiles of the de|&s;troyer, before you was aware of the par|ticular danger you was in. And it will co&s;t you many a groan in &s;pirit, many a tear, before you can recover your&s;elves out of the &s;nare, and from under the power of the devil. Even the young, alth&ocirc; they may never have been remar|kably vicious, will be no &s;trangers to the&s;e di&s;couragements and difficulties, when they &s;et them&s;elves in earne&s;t to &s;eek and &s;erve their Creator. Nor is it proper that they &s;hould be fed up, and deluded, with the contrary notions, that all will be ea&s;y and plea&s;ant to them at their fir&s;t &s;etting out in a life of religion, and obedience to God's commandments; which might be of very hurtful, if not fatal con&s;equence to them.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the ways of wi&s;dom are truly ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her paths peace, yet they are &s;o only to tho&s;e who have fairly entered into them, and for &s;ome &s;hort time at lea&s;t, been walking therein; who have gotten the ma&s;tery of their lu&s;ts, and br&ocirc;t their pa&s;&s;ions into &s;ub|jection to the laws of God and rea&s;on. In doing this, the difficulty lies; in getting into the right way; in thus &s;ubduing your
<PB N="112" REF="008667_0117_102faeb0962dbfe8">
lu&s;ts, and regulating your pa&s;&s;ions: And herein there ever was, and always will be, great difficulty, how much ea&s;e and plea|&s;ure &s;oever there may be in the exerci&s;es of piety and virtue, after the habit of them is in &s;ome good mea&s;ure gained. The &s;e|vering of your hearts from the world, from all the lu&s;ts and vanities of it, and devo|ting it to God, in &s;uch a manner as the go&s;pel makes indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, will ordinarily cau&s;e pain and angui&s;h, equal to that of cutting off a right hand, or plucking out a right eye; yea, it will be like rending the heart it|&s;elf a&s;under; which may be one rea&s;on why repentance is expre&s;&s;ed in &s;cripture, by the metaphor of "a broken heart." It may be added, that it would not be on|ly difficult, but altogether impracticable, for &s;inners to &s;ubdue their lu&s;ts, to change their carnal minds, and &s;erve God accept|ably, were it not for the grace and a&s;&s;i&s;|tances of his holy Spirit, thr&ocirc; which all things are po&s;&s;ible. Without him they can do nothing effectual to their &s;alvation. But his word gives them rea&s;on to hope, and firmly to expect, that if they are not wanting to them&s;elves, he
<Q>will not &s;uf|fer them to be tempted above that they are able; but will with the temptation make a way to e&s;cape, that they may
<PB N="113" REF="008667_0118_102faeb25a3ccfe8">
be able to bear it;</Q>
and not labor in vain, or &s;pend their &s;trength for nought.</P>
<P>BUT however unable you are to con|vert your&s;elves from the love of your lu&s;ts to the love of God; and altho' his pow|er is exerted in the change of every &s;in|ner's heart, that is effectually changed; yet you are not to imagine that his Spi|rit operates herein in &s;uch a manner, as to &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;inner's labor and endeavours, or to exempt him from all pain and toil and trouble, in turning to God. We may indeed &s;up|po&s;e it po&s;&s;ible for God to turn a &s;inner to him&s;elf, without any pain, or difficulty, or labor to the &s;inner. But it is certain that this is not the way, in which he ac|tually works upon the hearts of wicked men in their conver&s;ion. His almighty power is not exerted in &s;uch a manner as leaves them no work to do, no tempta|tions and difficulties to &s;truggle with, no &s;elf-denial to practi&s;e. For all who have ever been truly converted from their &s;ins to God, have actually found the&s;e difficul|ties in their way, and found by their own experience the nece&s;&s;ity of exerting them|&s;elves to the utmo&s;t, in order to &s;urmount them. And all theories and &s;peculations, &s;chemes and notions, whether re&s;pecting things natural or things &s;piritual, mu&s;t
<PB N="114" REF="008667_0119_102faeb5d3550538">
certainly give way to what is plain mat|ter of fact and experience, if there is any di&s;agreement betwixt them.</P>
<P>LET every &s;inner therefore, whether old or young, remember the&s;e two things, of great importance to be kept in mind by him; That without grace and help from above, he cannot effectually change his own heart, &s;o as to be made fit for the kingdom of heaven: And, That he mu&s;t co-operate with the good Spirit of God in turning to him. He mu&s;t not imagine that God will give him his Spi|rit in &s;uch manner and mea&s;ure, as will leave him no work to do, no trials and conflicts to go thr&ocirc;, no temptations and difficulties to vanqui&s;h. He mu&s;t learn to endure toil and hard&s;hip, if he hopes to become a good &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; he mu&s;t exert him&s;elf with diligence, prayer and watchfulne&s;s. This is as cer|tain upon one hand, as it is upon the other, that all his pains and labor would be ineffectual, without the ble&s;&s;ing of God upon them. Wicked men are required in the holy &s;criptures, not only to "&s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate," which our Saviour &s;ays was found but of few, at lea&s;t in that age and country wherein he lived; but they are even required to
<Q>make them a new heart, and a new &s;pirit.</Q>

Which admonitions evidently &s;uppo&s;e, that they have &s;omewhat to do, which is their own proper work, in their con|ver&s;ion to God and his righteous ways.

<P>BUT not to digre&s;s any farther from the particular point before us. It is mo&s;t certain that all &s;inners, even the young not excepted, will find many trials and difficulties, whenever they apply them|&s;elves to the working out their &s;alvation; much labour and pains will be requi&s;ite, and great &s;elf-denial, till &s;uch time as they have made &s;ome con&s;iderable attainments in religion. However, this &s;hould by no means di&s;courage or deter any from at|tempting a reformation of them&s;elves, with God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which will not be denied to them that &s;eek it aright. Whatever dif|ficulties may attend this work, yet, as was ob&s;erved to you above, it is a work of ab&s;olute, indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity to you: You mu&s;t either turn your feet unto God's

Wicked men gro&s;ly deceive them&s;elves, or are deluded by the devil, if they imagine, on the con|trary, that the power of &s;in and corrup|tion in them will decay merely by length of time, without their oppo&s;ing it; and that if they delay to keep God's com|mandments for a &s;ea&s;on, they &s;hall find repentance and reformation an ea&s;ier work, than it would be at pre&s;ent. The rever&s;e of this is mo&s;t certainly the truth. And yet it is highly probable, that many wicked men, unwilling to part with their &s;ins at pre&s;ent, for the love they bear to them, &s;ecretly flatter them&s;elves that this will be the ca&s;e; and upon &s;uch a ground|le&s;s &s;uppo&s;ition, and fond pre&s;umption, indulge their lu&s;ts year after year, 'til they are grown old in iniquity.

It is plentifully &s;upplied, and will be kept full, how great rivers and floods of iniquity &s;oever are con&s;tantly pouring from it. Yea, if pains be not &s;ea&s;onably taken to cut off its latent, &s;ecret &s;ources, it will ri&s;e higher and higher, 'til it exceeds all banks and bounds; &s;o that it will be next to impo&s;&s;ible to reduce and confine it, or prevent its drowning the &s;inner in de&s;truction and perdition. If it would be difficult for you to bridle and re&s;train your lu&s;ts now, how will you conquer them when they are grown far more violent and head-&s;trong? The words of the prophet, th&ocirc; perhaps &s;poken with another view, may yet be accommodated to the point in hand:
<Q>If thou ha&s;t run with footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how can&s;t thou contend with hor&s;es? and if in the land of peace wherein thou tru&s;ted&s;t, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the &s;welling of Jordan<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Jer. XII.5.</NOTE>?</Q></P>

<P>IT is not indeed to be denied, that a per&s;on's inclination to &s;ome particular &s;ins may be naturally le&s;&s;ened by time, age and experience; I mean, le&s;&s;ened of cour&s;e, without any efforts or endeavours of the per&s;on him&s;elf to amend his ways. But then his inclination to other particu|lar &s;ins will naturally and of cour&s;e be &s;trengthened, in the &s;ame, if not in a greater proportion. Man is not alike di&s;po&s;ed to the &s;ame &s;ins at all periods of his life; but has, like the year, various &s;ea&s;ons, which produce a variety of fruits. You &s;ee in the natural world, I mean up|on this earth, now under the malediction of heaven, that there are certain poi&s;on|ous weeds, and evil fruits, proper, and almo&s;t peculiar, to every month, from the fir&s;t opening of the &s;pring to the ap|proach of winter. There is a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion

of them, even upon the &s;ame &s;oil; one dies, in appearance, &s;till leaving its root alive in the earth, and another &s;prings up and flouri&s;hes in its &s;tead. Thus it is with mankind and their vices: The carnal heart of man is a &s;oil, fruitful of evil; &s;o that even in the early &s;pring of life, you will often &s;ee many corrupt fruits produ|ced from it. For, in the language of &s;cripture,
<Q>the wicked are e&s;tranged from the womb: they go a&s;tray as &s;oon as they are born &s;peaking lies.</Q>
And alth&ocirc; &s;ome of the&s;e evil weeds, the&s;e follies and vices of childhood, &s;eem to die away of them&s;elves, yet the root of bitterne&s;s is &s;till alive: And unle&s;s religion, a virtuous education, and the grace of God prevent, the&s;e vices will be followed by others, proper to youth; the&s;e by others, proper to manly, mature life; and the&s;e &s;till by others, more natural to old age. So that in every &s;ea&s;on of life, even from its ear|ly bloom to the winter of age, you will &s;ee a large crop of vices, but too naturally growing and flouri&s;hing upon this bad ground. Th&ocirc; the leaves fall off, and the branches wither away, at certain times, the poi&s;onous root of all is &s;till green, &s;trong and vigorous in the heart&punc; It re|mains like the root of the emblematic tree, which Nebuchadnezzar<NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Dan.

<P>IT is indubitably certain, that 'til a man &s;ets about reforming his heart and ways in earne&s;t, he will really grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e, whether he is &s;en&s;ible of it or not him&s;elf; and th&ocirc; it may &s;eem to him&s;elf and others, that he has for&s;aken divers of his youthful follies and vices; yea, th&ocirc; it may be true, he does not actually live in the outward practice of them. He may perhaps flatter him&s;elf that he &s;hall drop all the re&s;t by degrees, without taking a|ny pains to get rid of them, as the adder drops his &s;kin. However, the &s;erpent
<PB N="123" REF="008667_0128_102faed2b496ff58">
&s;till remains a &s;erpent in nature; he is dai|ly growing an older and more venomous one; and a new &s;kin will as naturally &s;ucceed, as the other fell off. And in like manner, 'til the &s;inner actually returns to God by unfeigned repentance, he grows more and more a &s;inner: He does at be&s;t, only exchange his old vices for new ones, and tho&s;e probably greater. The poi&s;on of a&s;ps is &s;till under his tongue, and in his heart, which will vent it&s;elf in &s;ome way or other: And all the time, while the deluded wretch fancies his vices are leaving him, he is growing into a nearer re&s;emblance of that
<Q>old &s;erpent, called the devil and &s;atan, which deceiveth the whole world.</Q>
The natural principle of con&s;cience will be in&s;en&s;ibly weakened in him; his heart will grow more callous and unfeeling; his power of &s;elf-govern|ment will gradually be lo&s;t; and the em|pire of &s;in in general will be the more firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed in his &s;oul, the longer it is &s;ubmitted to, and indulged: So that a reformation will become much more difficult than it would otherwi&s;e have been. According to the e&s;tabli&s;hed order of things, and the method of God's deal|ing with us, in our &s;piritual concernments, it is pa&s;t doubt, that we may much ea&s;ier turn our feet unto his te&s;timonies, &s;oon
<PB N="124" REF="008667_0129_102faed61c484ba0">
after deviating from them, and before we have gone far in the ways of error and vice, than when long, cu&s;tomary &s;inning, has render'd vice our &s;econd nature. For, as has been intimated before, it is ab&s;urd in this ca&s;e to talk of what God can do by his almighty power, and how ea&s;ily he can convert the mo&s;t obdurate &s;inner to him&s;elf, even without giving the &s;inner any pain, trouble or difficulty. However po&s;&s;ible this may be, yet &s;urely there is not the lea&s;t ground to hope, that he will in fact do thus. No, verily: They who enter into life at all, mu&s;t &s;trive and labor to do it; exerting them&s;elves with all diligence to work out their own &s;alva|tion, while God by his providence, word and Spirit, is drawing them, and working in them to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure. And the &s;ooner they &s;et about this nece&s;&s;ary work, the le&s;s &s;orrow will they give them&s;elves.</P>
<P>HAVING therefore e&s;tabli&s;h'd the&s;e pre|mi&s;es, the conclu&s;ion cannot be denied. It &s;tands thus: Since repentance and re|formation are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to our &s;alvation; &s;ince this work is painful and difficult whenever it is engaged in; and &s;ince it will certainly become more &s;o by being delayed; the mo&s;t wi&s;e and prudent cour&s;e is, to make ha&s;te, and immediately
<PB N="125" REF="008667_0130_102faedce2f64d58">
to apply our&s;elves to it. It is folly to put it off another day or hour. You &s;hould even now re&s;olve to amend your ways; your hearts &s;hould even now be lifted up to God in the heavens, in the exerci&s;e of humble repentance for what is already pa&s;t; in prayer for the pardon of it, and that he would grant you tho&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, which are needful in order to your for&s;aking your &s;ins, and keeping his holy commandments for the future.</P>
<P>SOME may perhaps &s;ay in their hearts, that this is hard doctrine.
<Q>May I not indulge my favourite lu&s;t a little longer? Mu&s;t I now, th&ocirc; in the bloom and vi|gor of life, mortify my members which are upon the earth? Mu&s;t I now take my heart from the world, on which I have be&s;towed it, and give it to God? How can I endure the thought of &s;o &s;udden and &s;peedy a change! Let me walk in the way of my heart, and in the &s;ight of my eyes, but a few years longer; and then will I, without reluctance, turn at God's reproof, and devote my&s;elf to his &s;ervice!</Q>
But, O child of di&s;obedi|ence, guilt and folly! I tell thee, and know thou it for thy good, that th&ocirc; thou &s;hould&s;t live a few years longer, as thou pre&s;ume&s;t, yet by per&s;i&s;ting thus in thy

evil cour&s;es for the pre&s;ent, thou art mak|ing hard and bitter work for thy&s;elf. Thou art making that which thou now thinke&s;t &s;o irk&s;ome and difficult, far more &s;o.

<P>TO draw to a conclu&s;ion; let me ear|ne&s;tly be&s;eech every impenitent &s;inner pre&s;ent, &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider what has been &s;aid, re&s;pecting the greater difficulty he will find hereafter in reforming his ways, if God peradventure &s;hould give him an opportunity for it, than he would find at pre&s;ent. It is certain from &s;crip|ture, and both rea&s;on and experience con|firm it, that vice and wickedne&s;s long in|dulged, become more hard to be &s;ubdued; that th&ograve; the external exertions and ma|nife&s;tations thereof in the lives and actions of men, &s;hould not be multiplied, or be|come more &s;ignal and ob&s;ervable, yet the habit and dominion of &s;in in the heart will be &s;trengthened; and the moral fea|tures of the &s;oul, becoming more di&s;torted

and mon&s;trous, be the harder to be re|claimed to the image and likene&s;s of God. This argument for making ha&s;te, is of great weight; and &s;hews, of it&s;elf, the great folly and imprudence of delaying your repentance. And as this is the only argument which I propo&s;ed to in&s;i&s;t up|on at this time, I will not now urge the &s;hortne&s;s and uncertainty of human life; nor any other Con&s;iderations to quicken you; though there are many &s;uch, and &s;ome, which are naturally &s;ugge&s;ted by the late di&s;pen&s;ations, and the pre&s;ent a&s;|pects, of divine providence.

<P>THE rea&s;onablene&s;s and importance of making ha&s;te to keep God's commandments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM V.</NOTE> was the &s;ubject of the two la&s;t di&s;cour&s;es, and is likewi&s;e to be the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent. Two ar|guments have been already in&s;i&s;ted on, for the illu&s;tration and proof of this point.
<PB N="130" REF="008667_0135_102faeebd0f0cea8">
The former of them was drawn from a con&s;ideration of the &s;hortne&s;s of human life, and the uncertain duration of this probationary &s;tate: The latter of them, from a con&s;ideration of the greater diffi|culty attending a reformation, if defer|red till the habits of &s;in are confirmed and &s;trengthened. I propo&s;e, in this di&s;cour&s;e, to urge another argument with the &s;ame general de&s;ign of exciting tho&s;e who have gone a&s;tray from God, and his holy com|mandments, to be &s;peedy in their return to him, and living &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in the world.</P>
<P>THIS third argument &s;hall be drawn from a con&s;ideration of the &s;uperior hap|pine&s;s attending a religious and virtuous life, compared with a life of &s;in, and ali|enation from God, the fountain of living waters. It is certainly a thing, very rea&s;onable in it&s;elf, and of great impor|tance to men, to make ha&s;te to be hap|py: I mean, to obtain the greate&s;t and noble&s;t happine&s;s, of which they are ca|pable in this world. No one, it is pre|&s;umed, will deny the rea&s;onablene&s;s of this, or its importance to us: For the de|&s;ire of happine&s;s is both a natural and ra|tional one; no ways criminal in it&s;elf, however criminal mo&s;t of the ways are, in which mankind &s;eek felicity; but per|fectly
<PB N="131" REF="008667_0136_102faeeede978b00">
conformable to the will of God, and the great end of our being. Now if it be rea&s;onable, and a thing of impor|tance to us, to make ha&s;te to be happy, it is equally rea&s;onable, and of equal im|portance to us, to make ha&s;te in turning our feet unto God's te&s;timonies: Or if it be irrational and fooli&s;h to delay the pro|&s;ecution of that happine&s;s, for which we were made, and which is within our reach, it is equally irrational and fooli&s;h for us to delay our return to God, and keeping his commandments. For there is no peace, no felicity, no joy in this world, comparable to that, which attends a life devoted to God, &s;pent in his &s;ervice, and in communion with him: And who|ever hopes for any happine&s;s here, worthy the pur&s;uit of a rea&s;onable and immortal creature, while he is wandering from his God, and violating his laws, is as certain|ly deceived, and will as &s;urely be di&s;ap|pointed, as God and his word are true.</P>
<P>DOUBTLESS a very common, and one of the mo&s;t fatal offences, which wicked men take at practical religion, and which makes them &s;o backward to reform their lives, has its ri&s;e in an ill-grounded ima|gination, that religion is a gloomy, me|lancholly bu&s;ine&s;s, a foe to human felici|ty; that it multiplies our pains, and a|bridges

Nor indeed can it be denied, that &s;ome injudicious, tho' perhaps very good men, have expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves &s;o incautiou&s;ly concerning the &s;elf-denial, and mortifications of a religious life, as very much to &s;trengthen this vulgar, and too natural prejudice of vicious men, a|gain&s;t the right ways of the Lord. And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that were religion &s;o great an enemy to men's happine&s;s in this world, as is often &s;uppo&s;ed, it would not be altogether &s;trange, that &s;inners are &s;o apt to delay their reformation, as they are. This, if true, mu&s;t needs be looked upon as a very great, tho' by no means a &s;ufficient objection, again&s;t a man's al|tering the cour&s;e of his life, and making ha&s;te to keep God's commandments: For who is forward to do that, which he knows will render his life more unhappy upon the whole, than it would other|wi&s;e be? My de&s;ign therefore, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is, to &s;how how groundle&s;s a prejudice this is; to make it evident to
<PB N="133" REF="008667_0138_102faef701d23b78">
you, by rea&s;on and &s;cripture, that a life conducted by the principles of religion, is the happie&s;t you can po&s;&s;ibly live on earth: And &s;o, from hence to argue the rea&s;onablene&s;s and importance of making ha&s;te to keep God's commandments, and live this ble&s;&s;ed life.</P>

<P>I KNOW not exactly in what light the&s;e reflections may appear to others, whether ju&s;t or not. But to me it appears with all the certainty of a &s;elf-evident propo&s;i|tion, that a life of rea&s;on mu&s;t needs be a life of happine&s;s; and that as far as men walk contrary to rea&s;on, they run into mi&s;ery: So that if the laws of God are rea&s;onable laws, we mu&s;t needs be gainers, even at pre&s;ent, by ob&s;erving them. It is plain to a demon&s;tration, that if the world is under the government of a perfectly wi&s;e and good being, as we all &s;uppo&s;e, the cour&s;e of life which he has pointed out for us, partly by that internal &s;en&s;e and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of moral obligations which he has given us, and more fully by an external revelation, mu&s;t needs be the mo&s;t happy cour&s;e of life that man can lead; &s;uitable to his nature, and in all re&s;pects be&s;t for him. From which con&s;ideration alone, it is evident to all that will attend to it, that to per&s;e|vere in di&s;obeying God's commandments, is, in effect, per&s;evering to be mi&s;erable; or depriving our&s;elves of that felicity which was de&s;igned for us, and is with|in

If we imagine that God's precepts, and our own rea&s;on and con|&s;ciences, concur in leading us a&s;ide from our true happine&s;s, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, there is a grand, fundamental error in the very nature, and original con&s;titution of things; that we are a contradiction to our&s;elves; that rea&s;on requires us to make our&s;elves mi&s;erable; that there is no wi&s;e and good moral government e&s;tabli&s;hed in the univer&s;e; but only a cruel tyran|ny.

<P>BUT leaving the&s;e general reflections, which &s;urely are not without their weight,
<PB N="139" REF="008667_0144_102faf08e50b7d70">
let us de&s;cend to fact and experience. And it will appear, as it was ob&s;erved a|bove, that a life of irreligion and vice is naturally productive of many evils and di&s;quietudes, from which the contrary cour&s;e of life is free. It is undeniable, that a di&s;turbed mind and unea&s;y con|&s;cience, are the common, and natural ef|fects of a wicked life. Some men are in|deed hardened to a great degree in vice; but, probably, never to &s;o great a degree, that they are kept in perfect peace in their own brea&s;ts. Generally it is far other|wi&s;e with wicked men. The con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of their crimes, and ill de&s;ert, joined with an apprehen&s;ion of God's righteous di&s;plea&s;ure, gives them great unea&s;ine&s;s, however they may try to drown the voice of con&s;cience. They are far from being &s;atisfied with them&s;elves, in their evil cour|&s;es, whatever they may pretend. A rea|&s;onable creature cannot be at quiet in his own mind, while he knows he is acting an unrea&s;onable part; that his Maker is di&s;plea&s;ed with him, and that he is con|tinually expo&s;ed to the fatal con&s;equences of that di&s;plea&s;ure. A &s;en&s;e of guilt, and &s;ecret apprehen&s;ion of danger, will or|dinarily lie as a heavy weight and burthen upon his mind; and, even in the mid&s;t of laughter, make his heart &s;orrowful.
<PB N="140" REF="008667_0145_102faf0bd3143b48">
The mind of man is the chief, and, philo|&s;ophically &s;peaking, perhaps the only &s;eat, both of plea&s;ure and pain: And if that is di&s;quieted within him, by any means, e&s;pecially by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his dai|ly violating his duty to God and his neighbour, and abu&s;ing his intellectual powers, it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould be hap|py in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any external goods, tho' he has more than heart could wi&s;h. This internal &s;ource of di&s;quietude will remain, while a man remains wicked and impenitent, tho' all things without &s;hould con&s;pire to make him happy. In this re|&s;pect therefore it is evident, that a pious, good man, has greatly the advantage of the &s;inner and profligate; the former be|ing free from that remor&s;e, and tho&s;e guilty fears, which always attend the lat|ter in &s;ome degree, and generally make life uncomfortable to him.</P>
<P>BUT there are al&s;o many external evils which are the natural fruit of an irreligi|ous, profligate life, from which evils good men are exempted. What a numerous train of woes does a libertine cour&s;e of behaviour lead after it, in addition to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e which are common to men?
<Q>Who hath woes? Who hath &s;orrow? Who hath contentions? Who hath wounds with|out cau&s;e?</Q>
Is it they who are &s;ober

and temperate in all things? Or they who "tarry long at the wine; they that go to &s;eek mixt wine?" Who are the mo&s;t &s;ubject to bodily pains and di&s;ea&s;es? They who keep under their body, and bring it into &s;ubjection to the laws of rea&s;on and religion? Or they, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions and appetites are without re&s;traint and con|troul? Do not the libertine part of the world generally pay dearly for their ex|ce&s;&s;es and debaucheries, in tho&s;e pains and bodily di&s;orders, which are the natural con&s;equence of them? Yea, do not many bring a premature old age upon them|&s;elves, and die before their time, by be|ing thus "wicked overmuch?" Whether we con&s;ider the hi&s;tory of times pa&s;t, or look round the world at pre&s;ent, or con|&s;ider the nature of the thing it&s;elf, we cannot be in&s;en&s;ible that vicious men do, and mu&s;t, bring many external, bodily evils on them&s;elves, which they might a|void by a contrary behaviour, and which good men are actually free from.</P>
<P>IT may be added here, that as human laws are
<Q>not made for a righteous man, but for the lawle&s;s and di&s;obedient, for the ungodly and for &s;inners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers, &mdash; for whoremongers,&mdash; for perjured per|&s;ons,</Q>

<PB N="142" REF="008667_0147_102faf1246771720">
not the righteous, &s;uffer by them, in the ordinary cour&s;e of things. Civil &s;ociety will not permit men to go on with impu|nity, in violating the laws of virtue and righteou&s;ne&s;s; but is obliged, for its own &s;ecurity and &s;upport, to puni&s;h them in a variety of ways. And how frequent are the examples of this &s;ort, even in times and places wherein religion and virtue are at a low ebb in general? Such is the na|ture of &s;ociety, and the laws by which it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts throughout the world, that aban|doned wickedne&s;s and vice mu&s;t needs be &s;ubjected to many inconveniencies, and even heavy penalties, from which virtue is ordinarily free.
<Q>For who is he that will harm you, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, if ye be followers of that which is good?</Q></P>
<P>FROM the&s;e con&s;iderations it appears, that the pre&s;ent con&s;titution and cour&s;e of things, is moral in a high degree, not|with&s;tanding the general depravity of the world. Such is human nature, &s;uch the natural effects of vice, and &s;uch the na|ture of &s;ociety, that vice is evidently the parent of mi&s;ery and evil, mental, bodily, and penal. Men are u&s;ually, tho' not univer&s;ally, made to &s;uffer evil even now, in &s;ome proportion to the nature and de|gree of their crimes. No one can habi|tually act contrary to the fundamental
<PB N="143" REF="008667_0148_102faf183af039f0">
laws of religion, righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;o|briety, without hurting him&s;elf, and ma|king his life much more uncomfortable than it would be, if directed by the prin|ciples of piety and virtue. And this being the ca&s;e, &s;urely wicked men &s;hould, for their own &s;akes, make ha&s;te, and not de|lay to keep God's commandments. By this means they would deliver them&s;elves from many di&s;tre&s;&s;ing fears, and po&s;itive evils, which are incident to a vicious life: So that the calm con&s;ideration of their own pre&s;ent intere&s;t, could not but in|duce them, when they think of their ways, to imitate the example of the P&s;al|mi&s;t in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>BUT for the farther illu&s;tration of this point, it was ob&s;erved above, that not|with&s;tanding the prejudices which men often entertain again&s;t religion; it is &s;o far from abridging us of the natu|ral plea&s;ures of life, which are worthy of our pur&s;uit, that it refines and ex|alts them all. You cannot think of any &s;ort of worldly happine&s;s or enjoyment, forbidden you by the laws of God, to which you would not be a&s;hamed to own before a wi&s;e man, that you had any in|clination; or that your own rea&s;on would not condemn you for coveting and pur&s;uing, even tho' God had explicitly
<PB N="144" REF="008667_0149_102faf19c663aa78">
laid you under no prohibition re&s;pecting it. For example; would you not be a&s;hamed to acknowledge before a wi&s;e man, that you took a plea&s;ure in intoxi|cating, or making bea&s;ts of your&s;elves, by drunkenne&s;s? Or that any part of your happine&s;s was placed in gluttony? Would you be willing it &s;hould be even &s;u&s;pec|ted, that you had any plea&s;ure in the&s;e things, or in them that do them, tho' re|vealed religion was out of the ca&s;e? Would you not be a&s;hamed to own, that you de&s;ired to enrich your&s;elves by inju|ring your neighbour? by &s;tealing, cozen|ing, or any of the various kinds of di&s;|hone&s;ty? Would you not think it a di&s;|grace, even tho' it were no &s;in, to be tho't capable of taking delight in practices &s;o unrea&s;onable, and unworthy of a man? Would you not be a&s;hamed to be thought per&s;ons of unbridled lu&s;t, and given to lawle&s;s leudne&s;s? &s;uch as could not be happy without breaking thro' tho&s;e rules and ties, on the ob&s;ervation of which the well-being of &s;ociety &s;o much depends; and which being di&s;regarded, no one could have the &s;atisfaction of knowing, either his own father, or his own offspring? Would you not be a&s;hamed to own, tho' you were under no apprehen&s;ion of fu|ture puni&s;hment, that you took plea&s;ure
<PB N="145" REF="008667_0150_102faf1ce88a95f8">
in a practice &s;o irrational, as that of bla&s;|pheming the holy name of God, or profanely cur&s;ing, either your neigh|bour or your&s;elves? You cannot, in &s;hort, think of any &s;pecies of plea&s;ure or enjoyment, forbidden by religion, which your own rea&s;on could ju&s;tify, or which your&s;elves could think worthy of your pur&s;uit, tho' religion laid you under no re&s;traints with re&s;pect to it. The world is all before you, given by our bountiful Creator to the children of men, with the things of it, for their u&s;e and enjoyment. You are laid un|der no re&s;trictions or limitations, excep|ting &s;uch as you mu&s;t acknowledge to be fit and rea&s;onable, and even nece&s;&s;a|ry, in order to the well-being of &s;ociety; and which being tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed by a man, he mu&s;t acknowledge, he acts below the dignity of his rational nature.</P>
<P>THIS being evident, I may a&s;k, Where is that hard and intolerable yoke of re|ligion, at which many are &s;o &s;candalized? It is purely an imaginary one. Where is that command of God, which you your&s;elves can pronounce grievous? In what chapter of the bible is that law, re&s;pecting the government of your pa&s;|&s;ions, which you would chu&s;e to have blotted out or repealed, for the common,
<PB N="146" REF="008667_0151_102faf1e6e581320">
or even for your own particular good, in order to have the road to plea&s;ure, any plea&s;ure worth de&s;iring, left more open than it is at pre&s;ent? Tho' I fre|quently read the bible, I can, for my own part, find no one command or pro|hibition therein, which abridges the happine&s;s, or real enjoyments, either of mankind in general, or of individuals, &s;o that they would upon the whole live more delightfully in the world if it were aboli&s;hed, than they may under the re&s;traints of it. And I may almo&s;t ven|ture to tell you, that whenever you &s;hall think in your con&s;ciences, after &s;erious, calm and deliberate reflection, that you have found &s;uch a grievous command|ment, you are at liberty to era&s;e it. For whatever you may imagine in the heat of pa&s;&s;ion, and for want of attending to the nature and con&s;equences of things, I may be confident that, on due and tho|rough reflection, you would be convin|ced, that all God's commandments are not only holy and ju&s;t, but even good; good for the world, and for your&s;elves. For, as was intimated above, religion does not only, not abridge the plea&s;ures and enjoyments of men in this world, but heightens and improves them all.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="008667_0152_102faf21c67194f8">No libertine enjoys that happine&s;s which is proper to man, con&s;idered merely as an inhabitant of this world, in &s;o great a degree, or in &s;uch perfection, as a chri&s;tian, who

This may perhaps &s;eem a paradox at be&s;t, if not a contradiction. However, it is certainly true; and will be in &s;ome mea&s;ure apparent only from the follow|ing con&s;ideration. Tho&s;e impious and vicious men who have, &s;hall I &s;ay, the mode&s;ty, or the impudence, to profe&s;s a total di&s;regard to the laws of religion, yet find the nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;cribing ma|ny &s;imilar laws and re&s;trictions to them|&s;elves, merely with a view at attaining their great and avowed end, plea&s;ure. They perceive the nece&s;&s;ity of ob&s;erving the&s;e &s;ame rules, many of them at lea&s;t, in order to their enjoying animal plea|&s;ures and gratifications in their greate&s;t height and perfection. And this, po&s;&s;i|bly, may be the true drift and &s;cope of the Epicurean philo&s;ophy; which is cer|tainly mi&s;taken by tho&s;e, who exclude all morals from their idea of it. So that whether men believe in God and his providence, or not; whether they will love, reverence and obey him, or the contrary; &s;till they are obliged, if they
<PB N="148" REF="008667_0153_102faf28270d9ab8">
would live in the mo&s;t refined and ele|gant luxury they are capable of, to im|po&s;e on them&s;elves much the &s;ame laws of temperance and moderation, and a certain oeconomy in their plea&s;ures, which religion her&s;elf obliges them to ob&s;erve. The connoi&s;&s;ieurs in voluptu|ou&s;ne&s;s, while they have no more &s;en&s;e of religious obligations, than the flocks and herds on which they riot, are yet, in one &s;en&s;e, tho' again&s;t their will, re|ally under the prohibitions, and mortifi|cations, and &s;elf-denials, which religion impo&s;es; being forced, if I may &s;o ex|pre&s;s it, to exerci&s;e the rea&s;on of men, in order to enjoy the plea&s;ures of bruits in their greate&s;t perfection. Which being the ca&s;e, it is a clear proof and demo&s;tra|tion, that keeping the commandments of God, re&s;pecting the government of our a|nimal pa&s;&s;ions, is &s;o far from dimini&s;hing the happine&s;s of man, con&s;idered in his animal and worldly capacity, that it is the greate&s;t improvement of them. All vicious, irregular, pa&s;&s;ions, as intimated above, are productive of pain and mi&s;e|ry. This is e&s;pecially true of envy, wrath and re&s;entment.
<Q>Bitter and malevolent tempers puni&s;h them&s;elves: They are not always gratified; never

Who would feel the torture of envy? Who would burn with raging rancour? Whoever hates any man, pays dear for his hate: Whoever is cur&s;ed with a revengeful heart, needs no other cur&s;e.</Q>
The vicious man, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are always either rampant, or palled to a nau&s;ea, has certainly a le&s;s &s;hare of real enjoyment, than he who &s;trictly ob&s;erves the commandments of God, following him, and rea&s;on. The former is always, either like a barque to&s;&s;ed in a tempe&s;tuous &s;ea, or one &s;tuck fa&s;t in a miry, motionle&s;s lake

and they are the mo&s;t intolerable to tho&s;e, who are de&s;titute hereof. Reflect &s;o|berly on human life; think of the out|ward calamities which come alike to all, and the various evils to which we are expo&s;ed; &s;ickne&s;s and pains of number|le&s;s kinds; the ill-will, and ill offices of our enemies; the lo&s;s of our friends; the uncertainty of riches, honors and all earthly goods: Con&s;ider the di&s;order'd &s;tate of the world in general; the fraud, deceit and violence that are found there|in from age to age; the revolutions and mighty changes that are frequently brought about in the kingdoms and civil affairs of it;&mdash; changes, as often for the wor&s;e as for the better: Con&s;ider &s;eri|ou&s;ly of the&s;e things, I &s;ay; and you cannot be wholly in&s;en&s;ible, either of the happine&s;s of good men, who have faith, hope and confidence in God, or of the forlorn, di&s;con&s;olate condition of the wicked, who are de&s;titute of this relief. How great is the &s;upport? how un&s;peakable the con&s;olation, when a man is &s;uffering adver&s;ity, or fore&s;ees it coming upon him; when he finds him|&s;elf encompa&s;&s;ed with infirmities, ills and dangers; and &s;ees him&s;elf, as it were, ju&s;t dropping into the grave, his fle&s;h and his heart failing him; how un&s;peakable is

the con&s;olation, I &s;ay, re&s;ulting to a good man in the&s;e circum&s;tances, from the re|flexion, that there is a God above, all-wi&s;e, good and powerful; that this God is his God forever and ever; his friend, and guardian, and portion; that the very hairs of his head are numbered by him; that he will cau&s;e "all things to work together for good to him"; that he will guide him by his coun&s;el during life, and at death receive him to glory, and joys forevermore? Surely this is the be&s;t &s;upport, that any man can have in &s;uch a world of confu&s;ion, danger and death, as this; than which the heart of man cannot conceive a greater, a more &s;olid or rational. But it may be further illu&s;trated by way of contra&s;t.

<P>THERE are peculiar and exalted plea|&s;ures attending the practice and hopes of religion; &s;uch as a "&s;tranger inter|meddleth not with;" &s;uch as a wicked man can form no adequate idea of; &s;carce more than a blind man can of co|lors, or a deaf one of &s;ounds: It is only experience that can fully make them known.

<P>BUT the happine&s;s of good men, who are at peace with God thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is not merely that, which naturally re&s;ults from a rational, well-grounded confidence in God's favour: They have, &s;ometimes at lea&s;t, a more direct and immediate intercour&s;e with God, and a &s;till more exalted happine&s;s ari&s;ing from &s;uch intercour&s;e, than any which re&s;ults from the deductions of rea&s;on, in the way of argumentation. I would not willingly be an enthu&s;ia&s;t. But when the &s;cripture &s;aith, "Truly our fellow&s;hip is with the Father, and with his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t": When it &s;aith, that the kingdom of God is "joy in the Holy Gho&s;t," as well as righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and peace: When the &s;criptures &s;peak of God, as the God of all grace and con&s;olation, who "comforteth his

In &s;hort, God does &s;ometimes, tho' not al|ways, by the immediate influences of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, cau&s;e his &s;aints to re|joice with joy un&s;peakable and full of glory," filling them "with all his ful|ne&s;s;" with a big, ineffable and divine joy&punc; that &s;wallows up all the &s;oul; a joy, as much &s;urpa&s;&s;ing, not only the plea|&s;ures of &s;in, but I had almo&s;t &s;aid, even the merely <HI>rational</HI> plea&s;ures of piety, as heaven &s;urpa&s;&s;es earth, or eternity is more la&s;ting than time! I am aware that &s;ome will probably look on this, as nothing better than enthu&s;ia&s;tic rant: To whom, God grant the only full, ade|quate and &s;atisfactory evidence of its reality, the experience of the thing it|&s;elf!

on this point. But it may be ju&s;tly apprehended, that the more general and common rea&s;on, why the&s;e things are called folly and enthu&s;ia&s;m, is, that men are really &s;trangers to the &s;pirit and power of religion in their hearts. And there is doubtle&s;s &s;ome good meaning of tho&s;e words, &s;o often abu&s;ed and perver|ted by cen&s;orious vi&s;ionaries &mdash;

of the Holy Spirit, &s;poken of above; in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;tinct from, tho' not wholly independent of, that peace and joy, which naturally ari&s;e from a rational and &s;criptural per&s;wa&s;ion of a man's be|ing in a &s;tate of favour with God. And the mo&s;t probable rea&s;on, why chri&s;ti|ans do not more generally experience the&s;e divine con&s;olations, and in a great|er degree, is, that they do not a&s;pire af|ter greater degrees of holine&s;s, and chri&s;|tian perfection; but content them&s;elves with little more than "a name to live." For you will ob&s;erve, that they are pro|mi&s;ed above, by our Saviour, not ab&s;o|lutely, but conditionally:&mdash;
<Q>If ye love me, keep my commandments: And I will pray the Father, and he &s;hall give you another Comforter,</Q>
&amp;c. But I mu&s;t not enlarge; it being time to draw towards a conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;hown in this di&s;cour&s;e, That religion, being a rea&s;onable &s;ervice, enjoined upon us by our wi&s;e and good Creator, mu&s;t needs be &s;uppo&s;ed in general conducive to the happine&s;s of mankind, even in their pre&s;ent &s;tate. And if we come to fact and experience, it has been &s;hown, That a life of irreli|gion and vice is naturally productive of many evils and di&s;quietudes, from which
<PB N="160" REF="008667_0165_102faf4f5b8f7b20">
the contrary cour&s;e of life is free: That religion is &s;o far from abridging us of any of the natural plea&s;ures of life, which are worthy our pur&s;uit, that it improves and exalts them all: That it affords the be&s;t relief, the mo&s;t &s;olid and ra|tional &s;upports, under tho&s;e numerous trials and afflictions which are common to men in this evil world: And la&s;tly, That the practice and hopes of religion are attended with other, with noble, di|vine plea&s;ures, and heavenly joys, to which wicked men are not only &s;tran|gers, but of which they cannot even have any proper or adequate conception. From all which con&s;iderations laid to|gether, it appears that a religious and truly chri&s;tian life is, beyond all com|pari&s;on, the happie&s;t that a man can live in this world; and that the plea&s;ures of the wicked are mean, low, and con|temptible, when compared with tho&s;e which good men enjoy. And from hence the main conclu&s;ion de&s;igned to be drawn, appears in a clear and &s;trong light; viz. That it is of great importance to wicked men to make ha&s;te, and not delay to keep the commandments of God, even with regard to their pre&s;ent, temporal welfare. For if the&s;e things are as they have been repre&s;ented, as
<PB N="161" REF="008667_0166_102faf50ef0ed448">
they certainly are, unle&s;s rea&s;on, &s;crip|ture and experience all con&s;pire to de|ceive us, (which is impo&s;&s;ible) it is the greate&s;t imprudence and folly for men to per&s;evere in their &s;ins; and of the ut|mo&s;t con&s;equence to them, immediately, and in earne&s;t, to devote them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of God.</P>
<P>SOME other arguments, if God per|mit, will be in&s;i&s;ted upon hereafter. Let me conclude for the pre&s;ent, by be|&s;eeching wicked men, if there are any &s;uch in this a&s;&s;embly, duly to con&s;ider that which has now been handled.&mdash; Whatever objections you may have in other re&s;pects, again&s;t a &s;peedy return to God and your duty, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t the redeemer and &s;aviour of &s;inners; I am almo&s;t confident you can have none, (after &s;eriou&s;ly weighing what has now been offered) on account of any &s;uppo|&s;ed happine&s;s which this would oblige you to forego: I mean, any which is not ab&s;olutely unworthy the pur&s;uit of rea&s;onable creatures; and the lo&s;s of which, would not be infinitely more than compen&s;ated, by the plea&s;ures of piety and virtue. This common ob|jection is doubtle&s;s &s;ugge&s;ted by the evil One, that he may de&s;troy the &s;ouls of &s;inners, by infu&s;ing into them a &s;en&s;ele&s;s,
<PB N="162" REF="008667_0167_102faf52f106f2f8">
irrational fear, that they will make them|&s;elves mi&s;erable by &s;aving them! There is a great degree of infatuation in all &s;uch-like apprehen&s;ions; there being, not only no vi&s;ible foundation for them in nature; but they being utterly re|pugnant to the plaine&s;t dictates of rea|&s;on, revelation and experience, all uni|ted. Be a&s;&s;ured that you will be &s;tran|gers to true happine&s;s, to the proper, and almo&s;t only happine&s;s of man, &s;o long as you continue &s;trangers to true religi|on, and "alienated from the life of God." So long as you expect to drink of plea&s;ure, while at a di&s;tance from the "fountain of living waters," you will be continually di&s;appointed, and &s;till thir&s;ty: All the ci&s;terns you can hew out to your&s;elves, will be broken, leaky ones, which will "hold no water;" none that is pure and whole&s;ome; none but what will, in the end, rather give you a vomit, and bring &s;ickne&s;s and death, a terrible death, than chear, re|fre&s;h, and immortalize you.

<P>A FOURTH argument, by God's per|mi&s;&s;ion and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is now to be ad|ded to the preceeding, to &s;hew &s;till more plainly the rea&s;onablene&s;s and impor|tance of making ha&s;te to keep his com|mandments, in oppo&s;ition to delaying it to another &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>AND the argument of the pre&s;ent di&s;|cour&s;e &s;hall be drawn from this con&s;idera|tion, That the &s;ooner we heartily engage in the &s;ervice of God, the greater degree of chri&s;tian perfection we &s;hall probably arrive at in this world; and accordingly &s;hall receive &s;o much a brighter crown of glory and joy in the kingdom of hea|ven. Let us, for the pre&s;ent, wave all other con&s;iderations, and confine our at|tention to this alone, that by God's ble&s;|&s;ing, it may have it's proper and full effect upon our hearts and conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="008667_0171_102faf5fcd5d43c0">IT was not &s;aid above, po&s;itively, without re&s;erve, that the &s;ooner we be|gin to keep the commandments of God, the greater degree of chri&s;tian perfection, and future felicity, we &s;hall attain to; but that this will "probably" be the con&s;equence. For it may be thought, that this is not univer&s;ally certain, with|out any exceptions. If we judge accor|ding to appearance, it will perhaps be &s;aid, that &s;ome per&s;ons who, as there is rea&s;on to think, have been truly religi|ous and virtuous from their youth, have yet been &s;o immer&s;ed in the cares of this life, and &s;o &s;lothful in their &s;piritual con|cerns, even while they &s;erved the Lord, that they have at la&s;t, when full of days, been chri&s;tians but of a dwarfi&s;h &s;ize; mere babes in Chri&s;t, with re&s;pect to their &s;piritual growth and &s;tature, tho' men with re&s;pect to the length of time &s;ince their &s;piritual birth. To pre&s;erve a due di&s;tinction of characters in our &s;a|viour's parable of the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Matth. 13.</NOTE> &s;ower, it may &s;eem requi&s;ite to under&s;tand &s;uch very imperfect, tho' &s;incere chri&s;tians, as the&s;e, where it is &s;aid, that

Our Lord explains him&s;elf thus, "He al&s;o that received the &s;eed among thorns, is he that hear|eth

the word: and the care of this world, and the deceitfulne&s;s of riches choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful <NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Ver. 22.</NOTE>": Or, as it is explained, perhaps with greater exactne&s;s and preci&s;ion, in the parallel place, they "bring no fruit to <HI>perfection</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Luke 7.14.</NOTE>". But whatever may be the true, preci&s;e meaning of the&s;e words, there is no rea&s;onable ground to doubt, but that the character alluded to above, is a real character in the chri&s;tian world. And tho' the labor, even of &s;uch imperfect and &s;lothful chri&s;tians, &s;hall not be wholly in vain; yet, as they have not "<HI>abounded</HI> always in the work of the Lord," there is no ground to think, that "an entrance will be mini&s;tred to them <HI>abundantly,</HI> into his everla&s;ting king|dom." If they gain an admittance into that ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate, as they doubtle&s;s will, they may well be content with an infe|rior man&s;ion.</P>
<P>ON the other hand it will be &s;aid, That there have been examples of per|&s;ons who, after long delays, have at length turned their feet unto God's te&s;|timonies; and who have, by redeeming the time with uncommon diligence, un|der a peculiar ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, arrived to high attainments in religion, to an e|minent degree of &s;anctity, and chri&s;tian

Tho' he is before-hand with the &s;un in his ri&s;ing, when he goeth forth to his labour, and after it in his reclining to re&s;t, he finds but little fruit of his labour which he has taken under it. On the contrary, do we not &s;ometimes &s;ee a man indulging to &s;loth the former part of the day, on the bed of ea&s;e, &s;aying,
<Q>A little more &s;leep, a little more &s;lumber,</Q>
rou&s;ed up in the afternoon; and applying him|&s;elf to his bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;o much addre&s;s and indu&s;try, that the &s;etting &s;un beholds much greater effects of his labour, than
<PB N="169" REF="008667_0174_102faf6af3de1b50">
of the other's; and his profit proportio|nably greater? And all this, it will be &s;aid, may be applied to men's religious concerns and labours, to the time when they re&s;pectively begin, and the rewards they &s;hall finally receive.</P>
<P>Now the truth of the&s;e repre&s;entations and facts is not to be ab&s;olutely denied; tho' &s;uch in&s;tances as tho&s;e alluded to, are comparatively rare. And the gene|ral truth of the propo&s;ition, which is the argument of this di&s;cour&s;e, is not mate|rially infringed by a few &s;ingular exam|ples that may be found of the contrary; which is the utmo&s;t that can be pretend|ed. But if we look a little more care|fully into the natural import of the a&s;|&s;ertion above, it may at lea&s;t be doubted, whether &s;uch examples as the&s;e, are re|ally any exceptions at all to the truth of it. For, plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that when it is &s;aid, The &s;ooner we heartily engage in the &s;ervice of God, the greater degree of chri&s;tian perfection we &s;hall arrive at, &amp;c, the compari&s;on implied, does not lie between <HI>us</HI> and <HI>other</HI> per&s;ons, but is con|fined to <HI>our&s;elves</HI>; and lies wholly be|tween <HI>our</HI> beginning earlier or later in life, to keep God's commands, and the greater or le&s;s degree of perfection and happine&s;s <HI>we</HI> our&s;elves &s;hall attain to, ac|cording
<PB N="170" REF="008667_0175_102faf6c7af4c9e8">
as we do one or the other; it being &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed that we engage hear|tily in the &s;ervice of God, whenever we engage in it, and per&s;evere therein with diligence. Which being con&s;idered, the propo&s;ition, I &s;uppo&s;e, is not only pro|bably, but certainly true; however true it may be, at the &s;ame time, that &s;ome per&s;ons who begin to &s;erve God at a late &s;ea&s;on of life, may, by uncommon dili|gence, and a peculiar ble&s;&s;ing on their endeavours, make greater advances in piety and virtue than &s;ome others, who did not delay &s;o long.</P>
<P>AND now, avoiding all u&s;ele&s;s &s;ubtle|ties as much as po&s;&s;ible, let me more par|ticularly explain and urge the pre&s;ent argument, under the following propo&s;i|tions; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>THAT religion is progre&s;&s;ive in the hearts and lives of good men:</P>
<P>THAT, by natural con&s;equence, the &s;ooner any one begins to be &s;incerely re|ligious, the greater improvement he will make at la&s;t in holine&s;s and virtue:</P>
<P>THAT the greater degree of chri&s;tian perfection we attain to, the greater will be our happine&s;s in the world to come: And la&s;tly, which is the practical con|clu&s;ion from the whole,</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="008667_0176_102faf6e04e7ad20">THAT it is highly rea&s;onable, and of great importance to us, to make ha&s;te, or that we do not delay, to turn our feet unto God's te&s;timonies.</P>
<P>THE former of the&s;e propo&s;itions, now to be enlarged upon in their order, is, That religion is progre&s;&s;ive in the hearts and lives of good men. When a &s;inner is converted from the error of his way, to the wi&s;dom of the ju&s;t, he is not at once made perfect in holine&s;s, or in any chri&s;tian virtue: So far from it, that no man attains to perfection, &s;trictly &s;peaking, in this life; there is always room for improvement both in know|ledge and in virtue, how long &s;oever a man has been engaged in the &s;ervice of God. And there is, generally at lea&s;t, mo&s;t room and occa&s;ion for &s;uch im|provement, in tho&s;e who are newly en|tered upon a religious cour&s;e of life. However po&s;&s;ible and ea&s;y it might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be, for God, by his grace and Spirit, at once to produce a com|pleat and perfect change in the heart of a wicked man, as compleat and perfect as is ever effected in this world; yet we know it is not agreeable to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed method of divine grace to effect at once &s;uch a thorough change. God is plea&s;ed, after our regeneration, to leave
<PB N="172" REF="008667_0177_102faf758b049268">
our improvement in goodne&s;s and holi|ne&s;s, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to our &s;elves; I do not mean independently of him, with|out whom we can do nothing; but un|der his gracious influence, or by his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. And thus it is, that from very imperfect degrees of goodne&s;s, the new man advances to higher, to a nearer re|&s;emblance of God, after who&s;e image he was "created in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and true holine&s;s <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Eph. 4.24.</NOTE>" That the &s;aints thus make progre&s;s in piety and virtue, is plainly a|greeable to the doctrine and repre&s;entati|ons of &s;cripture, as well as to experience. Our Saviour &s;ays, that the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mu&s;tard-&s;eed, the lea&s;t of all &s;eeds, which yet groweth till it "becometh a tree." This is ap|plicable, not only to the external, vi&s;ible kingdom of God in this world, under Chri&s;t, who is to reign till every knee &s;hall bow to him; but al&s;o to that king|dom of God which is "within us," and which "cometh not with ob&s;ervation;" or that kingdom of heaven which, the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "is not meat and drink, but righteou&s;ne&s;s, and peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t." This kingdom, as well as the external, is at fir&s;t &s;o &s;mall and imperfect, that it may be fitly compared to a grain of mu&s;tard-&s;eed, tho', by the
<PB N="173" REF="008667_0178_102faf7714eb4150">
ble&s;&s;ing of God, it will in its progre&s;s become great and flouri&s;hing, even like the cedars of Lebanon. Agreeably here|to, chri&s;tians are exhorted to "grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t." It is &s;aid&punc; that "the path of the ju&s;t is as the &s;hining light, that &s;hineth more and more unto the perfect day." St. Paul tells tho&s;e, to whom he wrote one of his e|pi&s;tles, he was "per&s;waded that He, who had begun a good work in them, would perform it unto the day of Chri&s;t." The &s;ame apo&s;tle having ob&s;erved, in his e|pi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;ians, that when Chri&s;t a&s;cended, he gave to his church, apo&s;tles, pa&s;tors, teachers, &amp;c. immediately &s;ub|joins, as the end and de&s;ign of their in|&s;titution, &mdash; "for the perfecting of the &s;aints, for the work of the mini&s;try, for the edifying of the body of Chri&s;t; till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t; that we henceforth be no more children; &mdash; but &s;peaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things." This may be under&s;tood, both with reference to the church in general, and to particular per&s;ons. In conformity whereto, St.
<PB N="174" REF="008667_0179_102faf78dd4679f0">
Paul, even after he had been many years a faithful mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, and not be|hind the very chief of the apo&s;tles, &s;ays of him&s;elf, under an humble &s;en&s;e of his infirmities and imperfections &mdash; "Not as tho' I had already attained, either were already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which al|&s;o I am apprehended of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Brethren, I count not my&s;elf to have ap|prehended; but this one thing I do, for|getting tho&s;e things which are behind, and reaching forth unto tho&s;e things which are before, I pre&s;s toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us."</P>
<P>Now all the&s;e, and innumerable other pa&s;&s;ages of holy &s;cripture, plainly &s;up|po&s;e religion to be progre&s;&s;ive in the hearts and lives of men; to be weak in it's beginning, or ri&s;e, and gradually ad|vancing towards perfection, by the care and indu&s;try of good men, under the &s;miles and influences of heaven, or the gracious operations of God's &s;pirit. And this repre&s;entation, as was intimated be|fore, is verifyed by the experience of good men in all ages and generations. As wicked men and &s;educers often, not always, "wax wor&s;e and wor&s;e"; &s;o good men, generally at lea&s;t, wax bet|ter
<PB N="175" REF="008667_0180_102faf7a6ea49ce0">
and better; "perfecting holine&s;s in the fear of God"; and obtaining, by de|grees, a more compleat victory over their lu&s;ts, till they are finally made even "more than conquerors, thro' him that loved them". Tho&s;e who are born of the Spirit, tho' they are at fir&s;t truly chil|dren and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s of God, and are in one &s;en&s;e perfect, <HI>viz.</HI> as no intire member is wanting in them; yet they are &s;poken of as being but "babes in Chri&s;t"; who accordingly need to be "fed with milk", that they may "grow there|by"; not with "&s;trong meat", which
<Q>belongeth to them that are of full age, even tho&s;e who, by rea&s;on of u&s;e, have their &s;en&s;es exerci&s;ed to di&s;cern both good and evil.</Q>
It is needle&s;s, I imagine, to enlarge any farther in the proof of this point. Rea&s;on, &s;cripture and experience, all concur in e&s;tabli&s;hing its truth, be|yond the po&s;&s;ibility of a rational doubt concerning it. Let us therefore proceed to the next remark mentioned above; which is indeed a plain con&s;equence from this; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>THAT the &s;ooner any one begins to be &s;incerely religious, the greater im|provement he will make at la&s;t in true wi&s;dom, virtue and holine&s;s; the greater degree of chri&s;tian perfection he will at|tain
<PB N="176" REF="008667_0181_102faf8243cd30b8">
to at the clo&s;e of life. Whatever is progre&s;&s;ive in its nature, requires time, and is improved, advanced and perfected thereby. There is no making progre&s;s in any thing, but by time. And if re|ligion in men's hearts and lives is pro|gre&s;&s;ive, according to the e&s;tabli&s;hed cour&s;e of nature, and the methods of God's grace, agreeably to what has been &s;aid above, it follows by plain con&s;e|quence, that the &s;ooner we turn our feet unto God's te&s;timonies, the greater pro|gre&s;s we &s;hall have made in chri&s;tian piety, when our days are numbered and fini&s;hed. The nearer our lives are to a period, when we begin to fear and &s;erve God, the le&s;s opportunity we have for improvement, and the lower will be our attainments at la&s;t. Notwith&s;tanding what was &s;aid in the beginning of this di&s;|cour&s;e, any man who begins his worldly labor with the day, and is diligent there|in, will do more than if he delay'd till it was far &s;pent, and the night was at hand, "wherein no man can work". Accordingly all men who are wi&s;e in the management of their temporal affairs, and hope to thrive by their indu&s;try, un|der the ble&s;&s;ing of God, are early at their bu&s;ine&s;s. And you would think <HI>that</HI> man talk'd very irrationally, who
<PB N="177" REF="008667_0182_102faf83ca112dd0">
&s;hould tell his poor neighbour, that he might &s;tand almo&s;t all the day idle, and then make up for it, by doubling his di|ligence when the &s;un was ju&s;t &s;etting. This is contrary to experience, and the common &s;en&s;e of mankind. All which is, in general, applicable to the higher concerns and bu&s;ine&s;s of religion. Youth is the morning of human life; death the evening or night: And cer|tainly if we begin to be wi&s;e and good, and to work out our &s;alvation, in the former, and per&s;evere diligently in do|ing &s;o, we &s;hall at la&s;t be wi&s;er and bet|ter, and more effectually &s;ecure our &s;al|vation, than if we delay till we are pa&s;t the meridian of our days, and death is at hand. This is as certain as it is, that if a man travel diligently all the day, be|ginning his journey with the &s;un, he will get farther on his road at evening, than if he delay'd till the afternoon.</P>
<P>BUT if we come to fact and experi|ence, the &s;ure&s;t guides in all ca&s;es where|in recour&s;e may be had to them, it is plain, that tho&s;e per&s;ons who have known and &s;erved God from their youth, have been much oftner eminent for their know|ledge and great improvements in chri&s;ti|anity, in their old age, than they who have lived as without God in the world,
<PB N="178" REF="008667_0183_102faf85ab8ce148">
till gray hairs were upon them. Tho' we &s;hould allow that there are &s;ome ex|ceptions here, they are but few. And as to tho&s;e very per&s;ons who may be looked upon as exceptions, I mean tho&s;e who have made a great progre&s;s in a little time, towards the clo&s;e of life; doubt|le&s;s they would have been &s;till far more eminent for their &s;anctity and chri&s;tian perfection, had they not delayed &s;o long to keep God's commandments. If this is allowed, it is &s;ufficient to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, as it &s;hows that the degree of our attainments in true wi&s;dom and ho|line&s;s, depends in a great mea&s;ure, under God, on the time that we begin to know and &s;erve him. The earlier in life we do this, the more perfect we &s;hall be, when the time of our departure out of this world is at hand, and we are going to "receive the things done in the body." This point, I imagine, need not be fur|ther in&s;i&s;ted on, it being &s;o clear from what was &s;aid above, concerning the progre&s;&s;ive nature of religion.</P>
<P>THE next thing to be con&s;idered is, That the greater degree of chri&s;tian per|fection we attain to in this life, the grea|ter will be our glory and happine&s;s in the world to come. The recompence of re|ward which the &s;aints &s;hall receive here|after,
<PB N="179" REF="008667_0184_102faf88de863580">
is not, indeed, a reward of merit, &s;trictly &s;peaking, but of grace; "the gift of God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord." However, the holy &s;criptures them&s;elves often call it by the name of a reward: And our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ays expre&s;ly,
<Q>Behold I come quickly, and my re|ward is with me to give to every man</Q>,
&amp;c. Now if the righteous are to be re|warded, it is mo&s;t agreeable to rea&s;on and &s;cripture to &s;uppo&s;e, that they &s;hall be rewarded in proportion to the degree of their goodne&s;s and holine&s;s re&s;pectively, however unde&s;erving all may be; the perfecter here, the happier hereafter. This &s;uppo&s;ition be&s;t accords to our con|ceptions of God, as the all-wi&s;e, good and perfect governor of the world; with whom there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons in judgment; who is neither influenced by any blind, groundle&s;s prejudice again&s;t, nor by weak partiality in favour of, any of tho&s;e &s;ouls which he has made, and which are all equally his, the &s;ouls of the parents, and the &s;ouls of the children. It is natural for us to expect, that the common Father of &s;pirits, the Father of all, will di&s;pen&s;e his favors to his chil|dren, in a &s;tate of retribution, not at ran|dom, or with the capriciou&s;ne&s;s of a lawle&s;s, unregulated &s;overeignty; but
<PB N="180" REF="008667_0185_102faf8c18c199c8">
according to &s;ome wi&s;e, proper, and fix|ed rule of di&s;tribution. And if it is rea|&s;onable to expect, that the righteous judge of the earth, how &s;overeign &s;oever he may be, will do thus; what method of di&s;tribution is &s;o likely to be ob&s;erved by him, as that of conferring greater de|grees of happine&s;s on his &s;ervants, in ex|act proportion to the degrees of their per|fection re&s;pectively, or their diligence and fidelity in his &s;ervice? Can we think of any other rule or method to be ob&s;er|ved, in this matter, which &s;o ea&s;ily and naturally falls in with our ideas of God, as the wi&s;e, ju&s;t and good governor of the world? or indeed, which it would not be very difficult, at lea&s;t, to recon|cile with &s;uch a character? In this way, there will &s;till be encouragement left for all, even the mo&s;t perfect, as well as mo&s;t imperfect chri&s;tians, to exert them&s;elves, and to abound always in the work of the Lord, in hopes of attaining to greater glory and felicity in the regions of im|mortality: And the belief hereof has an apparent tendency to promote piety and virtue among&s;t men. On any o|ther &s;uppo&s;ition, there is far le&s;s encou|ragement to virtue; any other would have a manife&s;t tendency to damp our endeavours after perfection, and be very
<PB N="181" REF="008667_0186_102faf8da116c3a0">
prejudicial to the intere&s;t of virtue in the world. For it is rather folly and impie|ty, than true wi&s;dom, for us to pretend to a more di&s;intere&s;ted and refined vir|tue, than that of the captain of our &s;alva|tion, who hath &s;et us an example, that we &s;hould follow his &s;teps; of whom it is &s;aid, in his humble and afflicted &s;tate in this world, that
<Q>for the joy that was &s;et before him, he endured the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame,</Q>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>IT is, moreover, to be con&s;idered here, that the happine&s;s of rea&s;onable, moral and religious creatures, mu&s;t almo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be in proportion to the degree of their wi&s;dom and moral perfection, in whatever &s;tate or world they are. We find it &s;o, even in this world, almo&s;t in|variably, amid&s;t the confu&s;ions, and ap|parent di&s;orders of the pre&s;ent &s;tate; and notwith&s;tanding the many &s;eeming hin|drances and ob&s;tacles that are in the way of virtue, or ob&s;tructions to the natural and genuine effects thereof. In the fu|ture &s;tate, we are a&s;&s;ured the&s;e ob&s;tacles or ob&s;tructions &s;hall be removed out of the way. It is therefore at lea&s;t probable, if not certain, from the nature of the thing, that in that other &s;tate, virtue &s;hall in va|riably, and without exception, have it's full effect; that it &s;hall actually produce
<PB N="182" REF="008667_0187_102faf9280ad2438">
tho&s;e con&s;equences, which it partly pro|duceth now, in a greater degree, much more uniformly and immutably; &s;o that the &s;aints &s;hall of cour&s;e be the happier, as they are wi&s;er, and more holy, or more like God, "ble&s;&s;ed forever." In that &s;tate, where bodily pains and &s;ickne&s;s are no more; where the "wicked cea&s;e from troubling"; where the &s;ociety &s;hall con&s;i&s;t only of &s;uch as are good and wor|thy, it mu&s;t needs be, that the mea&s;ure of each one's happine&s;s and glory, will be the degree of his capacity for rational happine&s;s; i. e. his moral perfection, or likene&s;s to God.</P>
<P>WHAT has been ob&s;erved above, could not be denied, or called in que&s;tion, on any principles of rea&s;on, even tho' the holy &s;criptures had been intirely &s;i|lent as to this point. Had they only in|formed us in general, that good men were to be rewarded hereafter, without &s;aying any thing particularly concerning the rule that was to be ob&s;erved in con|ferring this reward; we might rationally infer from the divine perfections, and from the nature of the thing, that the good would be rewarded re&s;pectively, in proportion to their virtue and perfection: e&s;pecially con&s;idering, what is &s;een and experienced even in this world of con|fu&s;ion,
<PB N="183" REF="008667_0188_102faf9405c60ed0">
that men are now generally, if not univer&s;ally, happy in the like pro|portion; for there are very few, if any exceptions.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the &s;criptures are far from being &s;ilent as to this point: They plainly teach this doctrine, &s;o encourag|ing to men, &s;o apparently calculated to promote piety and holine&s;s in the world. Our Saviour has not only told us, that in his Father's hou&s;e there are "many man&s;ions," intimating that they were prepared and made &s;uitable for the gue&s;ts, they were re&s;pectively to receive; but he &s;peaks of &s;ome per&s;ons, who&s;e reward &s;hall be "great in heaven;" emphatically great; they having di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves by their eminent vir|tue and faithfulne&s;s, under &s;ome peculiar circum&s;tances of difficulty and di&s;cou|ragement. The apo&s;tle Paul does not only tell us in general, that what&s;oever a man &s;oweth, that he &s;hall al&s;o reap; but, that "he that &s;oweth &s;paringly, &s;hall reap &s;paringly; and that he that &s;oweth bountifully, &s;hall reap al&s;o bountifully:" Which language is not the le&s;s intelligi|ble, becau&s;e it is metaphorical; but is as fully expre&s;&s;ive of the thing here in|tended, as if it had been &s;aid, that he &s;hall receive an abundant reward, who
<PB N="184" REF="008667_0189_102faf9999a28000">
abounds in piety and good works. It is &s;aid of &s;ome, in the parabolical way, that they had dominion given them over "ten cities," becau&s;e they had gained "ten pounds;" others, over "five cities," who had gained "five," &amp;c. The true moral of which, agreeable to the point before us, cannot ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken by any one, who is not willingly ignorant and deceived. And, indeed, that com|mon expre&s;&s;ion in the new te&s;tament, that men &s;hall be rewarded "according to their works," plainly implies the &s;ame thing. For the righteous will not, pro|perly &s;peaking, be rewarded "according to their works," merely by having a re|ward be&s;towed on them, unle&s;s that re|ward be al&s;o in &s;ome &s;uitable proportion to their works, re&s;pectively; and &s;o, greater or le&s;s in degree, according to the degree of their goodne&s;s, and moral attainments. To this I may &s;ubjoin, without a comment, which is unnece&s;|&s;ary, the words of the apo&s;tle:
<Q>There is one glory of the &s;un, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the &s;tars; for one &s;tar differeth from ano|ther &s;tar in glory. <HI>So al&s;o is the re&s;ur|rection of the dead.</HI></Q></P>

It may po&s;&s;ibly, at fir&s;t view, &s;eem the de&s;ign of this parable to intimate, not only that God might without inju&s;tice, but that he finally will, be&s;tow an equal reward on all good men, whether they have &s;erved him from their youth, or only to|wards the clo&s;e of life; or, without ma|king any di&s;tinction between them, in re&s;pect of the different degrees of their piety and goodne&s;s. This, however, is by no mean the intent of the parable.</P>
<P>THE known partiality and pride of the Jews, who had long been God's pe|culiar people; their contempt of the Gentiles; their di&s;daining the thoughts of their ever being put on a footing with
<PB N="186" REF="008667_0191_102faf9fb94b8e88">
them&s;elves in the kingdom or church of God, &s;o as to be equally heirs of eternal life; the&s;e things, I &s;ay, give us the true clue for interpreting this parable. The church, or kingdom of God in this world, is here repre&s;ented under the &s;i|militude of a vineyard. God's calling different people or nations into his church, in different periods of the world, the Jews fir&s;t, and afterwards the Gen|tiles, is repre&s;ented by the Lord of the vineyard's hiring labourers at different times of the day, &s;ome in the morning, and &s;ome at the eleventh hour. Under the &s;imilitude of his giving every man a penny at night, without any regard to the time when they came into the vine|yard, is repre&s;ented to us God's de&s;ign, in the day of judgment, to be&s;tow on the faithful Gentiles as great a reward, as on the faithful Jews, tho' not called into his church and kingdom till long after them. This is the true intent of the parable: Not that individuals, particular per&s;ons, whether Jews or Gentiles, &s;hould not be variou&s;ly rewarded hereafter, ac|cording to the degree of their goodne&s;s (which would be repugnant both to rea|&s;on, and to many clear te&s;timonies of &s;crip|ture); but that no difference &s;hould be made between Jews and Gentiles, as &s;uch;
<PB N="187" REF="008667_0192_102fafa14e08be30">
tho' the former were God's people &s;o long before the latter; and therefore expected, in all other things to have the pre-emi|nence, as what of right belonged to them. It was to humble this vain confidence, and arrogance, of the Jews, that our Lord more e&s;pecially &s;pake this parable. And, indeed, he plainly intimates, both in the ver&s;e immediately preceeding, and in the clo&s;e of it, that &s;ome of the Gen|tiles, who were la&s;t in the church of God on earth, might be fir&s;t in the king|dom of heaven above. In &s;hort, the words of the apo&s;tle, <NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Gal. 3.28, 29.</NOTE> are a good com|ment on this parable, tho' they do not take in all the parts of it:
<Q>There is nei|ther Jew nor Greek,</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q>there is neither bond nor free &mdash; for ye are all one in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: And if ye be Chri&s;t's, then are ye Abraham's &s;eed, and heirs according to the promi&s;e.</Q>
And the main de&s;ign of it may be fur|ther illu&s;trated by our Lord's own words to the Jews <NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">Luk. 13.29, 30.</NOTE>;
<Q>And they &s;hall come from the ea&s;t, and from the we&s;t, and from the north, and from the &s;outh; and &s;hall &s;et down in the kingdom of God. And behold, there are la&s;t which &s;hall be fir&s;t, and there are fir&s;t which &s;hall be la&s;t.</Q>
And there is the more rea&s;on for interpreting this
<PB N="188" REF="008667_0193_102f74f84a93ded8">
parable agreeably hereto, becau&s;e it is both introduced and clo&s;ed with almo&s;t the &s;ame words;
<Q>But many that are fir&s;t, &s;hall be la&s;t; and the la&s;t &s;hall be fir&s;t,</Q>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>WE may therefore, notwith&s;tanding this parable, be very certain from the reflections above, e&s;pecially from the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture before referred to, that God will hereafter be&s;tow a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed reward in heaven, on tho&s;e who have early devoted them&s;elves to his &s;er|vice, and been eminently faithful there|in: A doctrine very important in its con&s;equences, as it affords the greate&s;t encouragement to virtue; which would be apt to flag and langui&s;h, even in the be&s;t of men, were it not animated from time to time, by &s;uch-like reflections.</P>
<P>BUT I come now more particularly to draw the practical conclu&s;ion from the premi&s;es, thus e&s;tabli&s;hed; which is, that &s;inners &s;hould not delay, but make ha&s;te to keep God's commandments: An inference, which all mu&s;t needs &s;ee, is ju&s;tly deduced. For if religion be pro|gre&s;&s;ive in the heart and life; if the &s;oon|er we begin to be wi&s;e and virtuous, the more likely we are to attain to high de|grees of chri&s;tian perfection; and, final|ly, if the more perfect we are in this

world, the more happy we &s;hall be in the other; if the&s;e things are &s;o, &s;urely it is highly rea&s;onable, and of great im|portance to us all, to be &s;peedy in our return to God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in&s;tead of delaying to keep his te&s;timonies. Our own intere&s;t is far more e&s;&s;entially concerned herein, than in any thing el&s;e, which we can po&s;&s;ibly conceive of; and doubtle&s;s, what makes any thing to be of importance to us, is its connection with our own well-being.</P>
<P>AND, for what is it worth while to exert our&s;elves, to ri&s;e up early, and &s;it up late, and eat the bread of carefulne&s;s? For what does it concern us to make ha&s;te, rather than that we may obtain a di&s;tingui&s;hed crown of glory in heaven! If to be, in an eminent degree, like to God; if to be high in his &s;avour and e&s;|teem; if to be greatly ble&s;&s;ed among the ble&s;&s;ed; if to have, as it were, a double portion among the &s;ons of God; if to have an abode in one of the mo&s;t glori|ous man&s;ions in his hou&s;e; and, perhaps, caught up even to the third heaven, where the apo&s;tle was; I &s;ay, if it is not worth our while to be in ha&s;te for the&s;e things, it may be pre&s;umed, no one can tell, what is &s;o; or what is worthy even the lea&s;t, or late&s;t concern of man.</P>

All the rituals of religion, all the external ordinances of the go&s;pel, were de&s;igned to an&s;wer moral ends: Not, as many would flatter them&s;elves, that the ob&s;er|vers of them might have a di&s;pen&s;ation from ob&s;erving moral obligations, the mo&s;t fundamental and indi&s;pen&s;able of all others.

<P>FOUR arguments have already been in&s;i&s;ted on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM VII.</NOTE> in order to &s;how the rea&s;onablene&s;s and importance of making
<PB N="196" REF="008667_0201_102fb05e1b4e0938">
ha&s;te to keep God's commandments. The&s;e arguments were, The &s;hortne&s;s, and uncertain duration of our probatio|nary &s;tate: The greater ea&s;e of reforming now, than of doing it hereafter: The &s;uperior happine&s;s attending a religious and virtuous life: And the greater per|fection and glory, to which we &s;hall at|tain, by devoting our&s;elves early to the &s;ervice of God. It is propo&s;ed, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to &s;tate and urge another ar|gument in this di&s;cour&s;e, with the &s;ame general view, of &s;howing you the im|portance of making ha&s;te in this matter.</P>
<P>THE argument here intended, &s;hall be drawn from a con&s;ideration of the peculiar amiablene&s;s of religion and vir|tue in the young, the peculiar infamy of vice in mature life, and the greater ho|nor we do to God and our Redeemer, by making ha&s;te to keep the command|ments, than if this is delayed to the de|cline, or even the meridian of our days. This argument, you perceive, is calcu|lated to operate upon that &s;en&s;e of ho|nor, that de&s;ire of applau&s;e, that dread &s;hame, that quick and delicate &s;en&s;e of things, which are natural to ingenuous minds, before per&s;ons are gone far in the paths of vice; rather than it is to work on per&s;ons of a dull, a rough, crabbed,
<PB N="197" REF="008667_0202_102fb062ceee9dd8">
or &s;our nature, made &s;till wor&s;e by cu&s;|tomary &s;inning; e&s;pecially, than it is to work on quite hardned, veteran tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors; to who&s;e impious rebellion and war again&s;t heaven, nothing but the ter|rors of damnation, and perhaps not even they, can put a period.</P>
<P>SOME, yea, many, will probably look on the argument mentioned above, as being of very little weight or force; and e&s;pecially after tho&s;e more &s;ub&s;tantial, or, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, more gro&s;s and palpable ones, which have been handled in &s;ome preceeding di&s;cour&s;es. For I am not in&s;en&s;ible, that there are many per&s;ons of &s;uch a &s;aturnine, lum|pi&s;h and indelicate make, both among the old and the young, that they can &s;carce apprehend the force of any motives or arguments, be&s;ides tho&s;e that either promi&s;e them &s;ome happine&s;s, or menace them with &s;ome evil, of a gro&s;&s;er kind. Accordingly, the holy &s;criptures abound with threatnings and promi&s;es, motives and arguments of the latter &s;ort; &s;uch as &s;et before men ble&s;&s;ing and cur|&s;ing, great and &s;en&s;ible evils, and great and &s;en&s;ible good, re&s;embled to tho&s;e things which are commonly the mo&s;t dread|ed, and the mo&s;t valued in this world. And arguments of this kind are probably
<PB N="198" REF="008667_0203_102fb064a09aae00">
of the mo&s;t general u&s;e and benefit to men, con&s;idering what their frame is; how gro&s;s their &s;en&s;es and apprehen|&s;ions of things commonly are. How|ever there are other con&s;iderations, which ought not to be wholly neglected, as they may give an additional weight to the&s;e; and, indeed, may po&s;&s;ibly have a greater influence on per&s;ons of an inge|nuous temper, than tho&s;e more &s;ub&s;tan|tial ones, alluded to above. And it is to be hoped, there are not wanting &s;ome among&s;t us, who can apprehend, and even feel the force of that, which is to be illu&s;trated in this di&s;cour&s;e. I have called it but one argument: However, it mu&s;t be re&s;olved into, and con&s;idered under, the following particulars, which are the con&s;tituent parts thereof: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>THAT religion is peculiarly amiable and honorable in youth:</P>
<P>THAT vice is peculiarly odious and infamous in age:</P>
<P>THAT by an early devoting our&s;elves to God, we do the mo&s;t honour to Him, and our Redeemer:</P>
<P>AND therefore, That it becomes the young, as they regard either their own honor, or God's glory, to make ha&s;te, and not delay, to keep his command|ments; this being the obvious conclu&s;i|on
<PB N="199" REF="008667_0204_102fb066288ec830">
from the premi&s;es, and the great point in view. You perceive by the very na|ture of the pre&s;ent argument, that it is addre&s;&s;ed chiefly to the young; and not equally to all &s;uch; but principally to tho&s;e of them, who are of a more inge|nuous di&s;po&s;ition: For there is little ground to hope that it will have much influence on tho&s;e, who have no &s;en&s;e of honor or di&s;grace; but are wholly devoted to low and brutal plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>TO return then: RELIGION and vir|tue are peculiarly amiable and laudable in the young. Religion, or the &s;ervice of God, being in it&s;elf a rea&s;onable &s;er|vice, is, indeed, becoming and honora|ble at all ages, at all &s;ea&s;ons of life, in all per&s;ons without exception, whether old or young, great or &s;mall. But that which is &s;o fitting and decent, both in the decline, and in the dawn of human life, has &s;till a peculiar grace and beauty, and the mo&s;t attractive charms, in the latter. God him&s;elf is plea&s;ed to expre&s;s a &s;pecial complacency in tho&s;e that fear him in their youth. And all wi&s;e and good men are more particularly delight|ed with the appearances of a pious and virtuous di&s;po&s;ition, in tho&s;e that are ju&s;t coming into the world, as it were, than in tho&s;e that are ju&s;t going off the
<PB N="200" REF="008667_0205_102fb06dccefdbf0">
&s;tage. This is a known fact, which does not need any formal proof to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the truth of it. I appeal to the high commendations of early piety in the holy &s;criptures; to the writings of good men, and the common &s;en&s;e and apprehen&s;i|ons of mankind; I mean, of the wi&s;e and virtuous. But however certain and acknowledged this fact may be, it will be neither an impertinent curio&s;ity, nor a mi&s;-&s;pence of time, to inquire a little into the grounds hereof; or whence it comes to pa&s;s, that virtuous youth is thus more amiable and honorable in the eyes of men, tho' perhaps le&s;s venerable, than virtuous age.</P>
<P>NOW youth, according to prevailing cu&s;tom, and indeed, according to a too prevalent opinion in the world, is a &s;ea|&s;on for levity, in which the pa&s;&s;ions are to be indulged; and wherein it is com|paratively rare to find a per&s;on with a &s;erious brow, or of a &s;ober mind. This is far le&s;s the ca&s;e in more advanced years. Age is, almo&s;t of cour&s;e, grave and &s;olid, at lea&s;t in appearance; &s;o that the appearance of religion therein, be|ing more u&s;ual and common, becomes the le&s;s &s;triking and engaging, the le&s;s worthy of notice; to be &s;ure, of admi|ration.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="008667_0206_102fb06f521bcda0">CAN you tell why the fir&s;t flowers of the &s;pring, or the earlie&s;t-ripe fruit, has a peculiar charm, and delights both the eye and fancy, more than tho&s;e of mid|&s;ummer, or autumn, tho' perhaps of the &s;ame &s;ort, and even more perfect in their kind? If you can re&s;olve this que&s;tion, which is no very difficult one, you will, at lea&s;t in part, di&s;cover the true rea&s;on, why religion and virtue in youth, have a more engaging form and appearance, than in age. This is an indication of a promptne&s;s, and true greatne&s;s of mind, beyond the years of the &s;ubject, accor|ding to cu&s;tom; and to corrupt maxims, which give too great allowance to the indi&s;cretions, the follies, and vices of youth. It is an indication of an early-ripe judgment, of a premature wi&s;dom; and, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, proves the &s;uperior excellency of the &s;oil, or the greater care and pains taken in cultiva|ting it, whereby it yields &s;o early a crop of virtue. It is not therefore &s;trange that tho&s;e, who have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the worth and importance of virtue in every age, &s;hould be more e&s;pecially delighted with it in an age, wherein it is &s;o unu&s;ual. It charms, not only by it's intrin&s;ick va|lue, but by the &s;ingularity of it in that age, and in &s;uch per&s;ons; as a rich dia|mond,
<PB N="202" REF="008667_0207_102fb070da96fdd8">
or wedge of gold, found in a cot|tage, would be a much more engaging curio&s;ity, than one of equal value, &s;een in a palace. But, to return to the for|mer &s;imilitude: Should we behold a lilly of the field, arrayed in more beauty than Solomon in all his glory, before o|thers &s;how'd their heads, and while their roots, perhaps, lay covered with fro&s;t and &s;now, it would naturally attract our admiration in that &s;ea&s;on, tho' we might little regard it a month or two later. 'Tis thus we admire the virtue of youth, while we comparatively di&s;re|gard that of mature age. Or &s;hould a fruit-tree of a particular kind, which u&s;ed commonly to bear, not till the fifth or &s;ixth year after planting (when &s;ome of its branches, perhaps, already began to wither) bud, and blo&s;&s;om, and bear fruit plentifully, the fir&s;t or &s;econd year, while all its boughs were green and flouri&s;hing, every &s;pectator would be plea&s;ed with &s;uch a rarity. Well, therefore, may we be &s;truck, and particularly plea&s;ed, with &s;o rare a phaenomenon, as a very young per&s;on bringing forth much of that fruit, by which our Father in heaven is glori|fied: Well may we look on &s;uch a one, as a di&s;tingui&s;hed plant of renown in the garden of God, while older ones, tho'
<PB N="203" REF="008667_0208_102fb073db86c0c0">
equally, or more fruitful, are little re|garded.</P>
<P>IT is naturally expected, that the hoary head &s;hould be found in the way of wi&s;|dom and righteou&s;ne&s;s: And tho' it is truly "a crown of glory <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Prov. 16.31.</NOTE>" to him that wears it, being found in this way; yet we cannot, even then, look upon it as a crown of glory, equal to that of wi&s;dom and piety on the head of youth, where there is commonly nothing found but folly and extravagance, but vain and wicked imaginations.</P>
<P>ANOTHER rea&s;on, why early wi&s;|dom and virtue are particularly plea&s;ing to the wi&s;e and good, is, that they pro|mi&s;e an eminent degree of perfection in more advanced life. They delight, not only by their pre&s;ent appearance, but by the pro&s;pect which they afford; a pro|&s;pect, that he who is, even in youth a &s;aint, will in age be in the foremo&s;t rank of &s;uch, and a di&s;tingui&s;hed ble&s;|&s;ing in his day; agreeably to what was &s;aid in the la&s;t preceeding di&s;cour&s;e, con|cerning the progre&s;&s;ive nature of virtue and religion. All good men have the intere&s;t of the common-wealth, and of the church of Chri&s;t, nearly at heart: To both which, &s;uch examples of early virtue bode good; e&s;pecially if found
<PB N="204" REF="008667_0209_102fb07a29ceed38">
in tho&s;e, who, by their birth, fortune and quality, are likely to act in &s;ome public &s;phere, where their influence will be ex|ten&s;ive. The tree which is remarkably flouri&s;hing in its youth, promi&s;es in due time, if not cut down, to &s;pread its boughs far and wide; to afford, at once, an a|bundance of fruit, an ample &s;hade from the &s;corching &s;un, and a covert from the &s;torm. In like manner does a youth of eminent virtue and accompli&s;hments, e&s;pecially in any of the higher ranks of life, bid fair to become at length, a great and di&s;tingui&s;hed ble&s;&s;ing, either to the church or the &s;tate, or perhaps to both. It would therefore be a wonder, if wi&s;|dom and virtue in this early &s;ea&s;on, did not afford a peculiar plea&s;ure to all good men; being at the &s;ame time, both a rare phaenomenon, and the earne&s;t of &s;o much good to the world.</P>
<P>AND now, if the young have any &s;en&s;e of true honor, any ambition to be e&s;teem|ed highly by the wi&s;e and good; the path of glory is plain and open before them: Let them avoid the &s;nares of vice, and re&s;i&s;t all her deceitful charms; let them con&s;ecrate the beginning, by which they will, as it were, make all the re|maining part of life, &s;acred to God and virtue. Hereby they will acquire the
<PB N="205" REF="008667_0210_102fb07bb1528a88">
true&s;t fame; that of doing good. They will begin life with honor: As it advan|ces, they will &s;till grow in favour with God and man: They will al&s;o end life with glory; and even after death, their memory will &s;till be ble&s;&s;ed, when all other fame would for&s;ake them, or per|haps be turned into the foule&s;t and ju&s;t|e&s;t reproaches. For the very be&s;t that the wicked and impious can expect, is, that their name and memory &s;hall rot!</P>
<P>YOU &s;hould now be a&s;hamed of that, which is in it&s;elf &s;o &s;hameful; and which will bring reproach in the latter end. You &s;hould now be in love with that, which is in its own nature &s;o love|ly and honorable; and which will pro|cure you the highe&s;t renown at la&s;t. And here it will not be ami&s;s to remind you, that all vice in general, and &s;ome vices more particularly, are repre&s;ented in &s;cripture by the metaphors of impuri|ty, defilement, filthine&s;s, uncleanne&s;s, &amp;c. while, on the other hand, virtue and piety are expre&s;&s;ed by the terms pu|rity, cleanne&s;s of heart and hands, and the like: And "fine linnen, clean and white," is the &s;cripture-emblem of the "righteou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;aints." The de|&s;ign of the&s;e metaphors and emblems is, to make us abhor vice, as being foul,
<PB N="206" REF="008667_0211_102fb07d6cac4b68">
loath&s;ome, and di&s;graceful to us; and to in&s;pire us with the love of true virtue, as being in its own nature mo&s;t amiable, ornamental, and glorious. The young, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are any ways di&s;|tingui&s;hed by their birth or fortune, are generally fond of appearing neat and clean, and well-dre&s;s'd; and indeed, of be|ing &s;o in private, as well as appearing &s;o in public: They would be quite a&s;hamed and di&s;concerted, to be found in a dirty, &s;lovenly dre&s;s. But how much more ambitious ought the young to be of that moral purity, which is the beauty and ornament of the &s;oul? how much more a&s;hamed of that moral defilement, which makes it deformed and odious? I do not mean, ambitious of the one, or a&s;hamed of the other, only in company, or when the world beholds them; but in &s;ecret, even when no eyes are upon them, ex|cept tho&s;e, which are &s;aid to be "as a flame of fire"; which
<Q>run to and fro in the earth, beholding the evil and the good</Q>;
equally beholding tho&s;e who, to u&s;e the language of &s;cripture, have "defiled their garments," and "&s;potted them by the fle&s;h;" and tho&s;e, who&s;e
<Q>robes are wa&s;hed, and made white in the blood of the Lamb.</Q>
The apo&s;tle hints at &s;ome things that are
<PB N="207" REF="008667_0212_102fb07ef733baa8">
done in &s;ecret, &s;o foul, that
<Q>it is a &s;hame even to &s;peak of them</Q>.
How much more &s;hameful is it then to practi&s;e them, tho' it be in &s;ecret? Nor, indeed, is there any thing now hid, which &s;hall not be made manife&s;t; yea, which is not already &s;o to Him,
<Q>with whom we have to do.</Q></P>
<P>TO fini&s;h the fir&s;t part of the pre&s;ent argument; tho' virtue is truly amiable and ornamental in all, it is mo&s;t &s;o in the young, in divers re&s;pects. Some of the&s;e have been &s;poken of already; and there is another which I &s;hall ju&s;t mention here: The pa&s;&s;ions, &s;ome of them more e&s;pecially, are naturally &s;tronger in youth than in age; which con&s;ideration doubt|le&s;s makes the conque&s;t, or due regula|tion of them, in that &s;ea&s;on of life, the mo&s;t honorable and glorious; far more &s;o, than any other victory or triumph: For he that is "&s;low to anger," or re&s;trains his other pa&s;&s;ions within due bounds,
<Q>is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth his &s;pirit, than he that taketh a city</Q>.
Remember therefore, the coun&s;el which David gave to Solo|mon, while young, tho' it &s;eems the latter unhappily di&s;regarded it, till he was advanced in years.
<Q>I was my father's &s;on, &s;ays he, tender and only
<PB N="208" REF="008667_0213_102fb08727fd5da0">
beloved in the &s;ight of my mother. He taught me al&s;o, and &s;aid unto me, Let thine heart retain my words &mdash; Wi&s;dom is the principal thing, there|fore get wi&s;dom; and with all thy getting, get under&s;tanding.</Q>
<Q>Exalt her, and &s;he &s;hall promote thee; &s;he &s;hall bring thee to honor when thou do&s;t embrace her: She &s;hall give to thine head an or|nament of grace; a crown of gold &s;hall &s;he deliver to thee <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Prov. 4.3,&mdash;</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>BUT, in order the more effectually to di&s;&s;uade the young from delaying to &s;erve God, or from continuing to &s;erve divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures, till they are far advanced in years, and got, as it were, within the confines of death; I was, in the next place, more particular|ly to remind them of the great odiou&s;|ne&s;s and infamy of vice in maturer life. Whoever, being now young, determines not to be virtuous and pious, till he is advanced to middle, or old age, does, in effect, re&s;olve to be vicious and impious at that period of life; if not thro' it, yet, at lea&s;t, till he has enter'd upon it: A &s;ea|&s;on of life wherein, as was intimated, vice is much more odious and di&s;graceful, be|cau&s;e more inexcu&s;eable, than it is in childhood and youth. By how much more amiable and prai&s;e-worthy virtue
<PB N="209" REF="008667_0214_102fb0892d6b3a50">
is in youth, than in old age, by &s;o much more hateful and &s;hameful is vice in old age, than in youth. And people of re|flection are almo&s;t as much &s;truck with horror in the latter ca&s;e, as they are with plea&s;ure, and agreeable &s;urprize, in the former. There is a real and ju&s;t, tho' not an equal foundation in nature, for the&s;e different emotions of the mind, oc|ca&s;ioned by &s;uch different objects as a young &s;aint, and a veteran &s;inner. I &s;ay, not an equal foundation; becau&s;e folly and vice are not &s;o &s;ingular in ma|ture life, or even in old age, as wi&s;dom and virtue are in youth; and the pecu|liar amiablene&s;s of the latter ari&s;es, in part, from the rarity of the thing, or its being &s;o uncommon, as was ob&s;erved a|bove. However, after allowing all that is proper, in re&s;pect of this di&s;parity in one circum&s;tance, I &s;uppo&s;e all will readily grant in general, that an aged fool, bla&s;phemer, knave, or debauchee, is a much more contemptible and odious character, than a young one, altho', in this evil world, it is not &s;o &s;ingular as a young man of wi&s;dom and virtue.</P>
<P>ALTHO' vice in age is not &s;o &s;ingular as virtue in youth, and therefore is not altogether &s;o &s;triking; there is &s;till &s;uffi|cient rea&s;on why it &s;hould be, as it is in
<PB N="210" REF="008667_0215_102fb08ab44b11d8">
the common apprehen&s;ion of men, at lea&s;t of the wi&s;e and good, more di&s;|graceful in mature, than in early life. For it is, in that age or &s;ea&s;on of life, precluded from availing it&s;elf of tho&s;e pleas, apologies and excu&s;es, which are generally made, and too generally allow|ed, in favour of vicious youth; &s;uch as, want of time for reflection, the &s;trength of pa&s;&s;ion, inexperience, and the like. The&s;e excu&s;es, tho' quite in&s;ufficient, ought, doubtle&s;s, to have &s;ome weight, &s;o as to extenuate the crimes and guilt of youth, in a degree: And they are often, tho' unju&s;tly, urged, as if they, in a man|ner, exempted youth from blame, what|ever is done in that age. How often is the exce&s;s of riot and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and even of prophanene&s;s and impiety, ju&s;tified, as it were, by the&s;e few words, or the like?&mdash;
<Q>He is an inexperienced, thoughtle&s;s, young man.</Q>
&mdash;And tho' candor is highly commendable, &s;o far as there is room for it in rea&s;on; yet, &s;urely, tho&s;e who make the&s;e, or &s;uch-like re|flections, on the follies and vices of youth, ought to reflect al&s;o, that vice is &s;till vice; that even the young have ca|pacity &s;ufficient, and ought to know what it is, and to ab&s;tain from it; and therefore, that they are not to be ju&s;tifi|ed
<PB N="211" REF="008667_0216_102fb08e1bb73ed0">
by &s;uch ob&s;ervations, which, I think, are never made in the holy &s;criptures, with the like view or de&s;ign. The language of &s;cripture is,
<Q>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the &s;ight of thine eyes: But know thou, that for all the&s;e things, <HI>God will bring thee into judgment. Therefore remove &s;orrow from thine heart, and put away evil from thy fle&s;h; for childhood and youth are vanity</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Eccl. 12.13, 14.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>BUT to return from what may, per|haps, &s;eem a digre&s;&s;ion; the greater the allowance is, which ought in rea&s;on to be made for vicious youth, as &s;uch, the le&s;s ought in rea&s;on to be made for vici|ous age, as &s;uch. And without fixing preci&s;ely, bounds, limits and degrees, in this ca&s;e (which is impo&s;&s;ible, and there|fore ab&s;urd to attempt,) we are much more naturally led to expect gravity, and &s;obriety of mind and manners, in per&s;ons come to mature life, than in the young. And therefore our &s;urprize and horror are proportionably heightened, when|ever we &s;ee the gray hairs of age, and all the folly, madne&s;s and licentiou&s;ne&s;s of youth, united in the &s;ame per&s;ons.&mdash; Their rea&s;on is pre&s;umed to be long &s;ince
<PB N="212" REF="008667_0217_102fb093b180f940">
come to maturity; they have had time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or reflection and con&s;ideration; they have had much experience, in the or|dinary progre&s;s of things; many of their natural pa&s;&s;ions are of cour&s;e &s;ub&s;ided, in a degree; and temptation is le&s;&s;ened. All which things, not only make vicious age appear, but actually renders it much more odious and contemptible, than vi|cious youth. Whatever apologies we make for the young, in the re&s;pects a|bovementioned, to extenuate their faults and vices; we can make none of them in behalf of the aged; or tho&s;e who are, long &s;ince, arrived at the years of di&s;cre|tion and reflection: E&s;pecially if they were favoured with a religious education in their youth; if they have always li|ved under the light of the go&s;pel, and been frequently admoni&s;hed, both by the word and providences of God, to for&s;ake their &s;ins, and keep his command|ments. Such men, to be &s;ure, are left wholly without excu&s;e; yea, without any rea&s;onable apology, for their &s;ins. They have a double, a treble, yea, a tenfold &s;hare of infamy and guilt, lying upon them: and are like that ground which the apo&s;tle James &s;peaks of, which, after long cultivation, bearing nothing but briars, and thorns, and weeds, is
<Q><PB N="213" REF="008667_0218_102fb09537d53e50">nigh unto cur&s;ing, who&s;e end is to be burned.</Q></P>
<P>LET the young think &s;oberly of this: For youth and &s;obriety are not univer|&s;ally enemies, or &s;trangers to each other, how &s;eldom &s;oever they may meet, and embrace as friends. Con&s;ider the great &s;hame and infamy that ju&s;tly belong to impious and vicious per&s;ons, even in middle, but e&s;pecially in old age. Con|&s;ider that man, (for doubtle&s;s many &s;uch are to be found) who, tho' he has enjoy|ed many advantages of a religious nature, and is now pa&s;t the meridian of his life, has never yet tho't &s;oberly of his latter end, or of his duty to God, who gave, and pre&s;erves his being. Reflect on &s;uch a one as, almo&s;t daily, perhaps, transforms him&s;elf into a brute, by his intemperance: On another, who&s;e mouth is &s;till filled with oaths and profanity: On a third, who, regardle&s;s of a trea&s;ure in heaven, is &s;et on getting earthly riches, not by right, but by fraud, and oppre&s;&s;ion: On another, who is &s;o e&s;tranged from the God of truth, that lying and fal&s;hood are his delight: On another, who is &s;till intent on gratifying his fle&s;hly lu&s;ts, even after his fle&s;h, his body and, perhaps, his e&s;tate, are almo&s;t con&s;umed, by his de|baucheries; &s;o that he is become, not

only the &s;corn of the good, but even the ridicule and contempt of his former com|panions in vice and guilt. Reflect on the&s;e, and &s;uch-like characters, I &s;ay, which are common, and tell me whe|ther there is not a peculiarly infamy ju&s;tly belonging to them; I mean, in the old, or even middle age? If you are per&s;ons of &s;uch an ingenuous turn of mind, as this di&s;cour&s;e was more parti|cularly de&s;igned for, I am &s;ure you think, nothing can well be more odious or contemptible than &s;uch men, howe|ver di&s;tingui&s;hed by their &s;tation and circum&s;tances in life. For even an old, and fooli&s;h, and wicked king, is &s;poken of by Solomon, as a mo&s;t de&s;picable character; while that of a wi&s;e child is highly commended by him. Well: If &s;uch per&s;ons are ju&s;tly the objects of great contempt; if they are de&s;pi&s;ed by all wi&s;e men, and the all-wi&s;e God; are you willing to be like them, and &s;o become objects of the &s;ame contempt and abhorrence your&s;elves? as you will certainly be, if you &s;hould delay to keep God's commandments, and per&s;evere in the practice of &s;in and vice, in the man|ner they have done. For, &s;urely, you cannot flatter your&s;elves, that tho' you &s;hould act like them, tread in their &s;teps,
<PB N="215" REF="008667_0220_102fb09c9b8038e0">
and imitate their bad example, yet you &s;hall avoid that ju&s;t ignominy, which they have incurred. What can you rea|&s;onably expect, if you retain your vices and follies, till you are as far advanced in years as they, and under the enjoy|ment of like advantages, but to become as de&s;picable and odious hereafter, as they are at pre&s;ent; and as you acknow|ledge, they ought to be accounted? You cannot be &s;o partial to your&s;elves, and your own fame, as to entertain the lea&s;t hope, that the wi&s;e and good will honor you, if you &s;hould grow old in tho&s;e vices and impieties, on account of which they de&s;pi&s;e others, become &s;o al|ready.</P>
<P>To clo&s;e this part of the argument, therefore: If you have any ingenuous dread of the ju&s;te&s;t infamy; if you would not incur the contempt of all wi&s;e and virtuous men; yea, if you would not be de&s;pi&s;ed of God him&s;elf; do not entertain a thought of continuing to indulge your lu&s;ts, till you are more advanced in years. Turn your feet, even while you are young, into that good path, from which you will have no de&s;ire to depart, when you are old: That path, in which you will have all the wi&s;e and good for your fellow-tra|vellers,
<PB N="216" REF="008667_0221_102fb09e21363e38">
from whom you will ever re|ceive that honor which is infinitely more than a balance for the contempt, or ri|dicule, of ten million vicious fools; that path of the ju&s;t, which will
<Q>&s;hine more and more unto the perfect day:</Q>
in fine, the path which will conduct you to that eternal kingdom and glory, to which you are called by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 1.10.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT it is time to proceed to the third branch of the pre&s;ent argument which is, That greater honor will redound, not on|ly to your&s;elves, but to God and your Redeemer, by making ha&s;te to keep the divine commandments, than by delaying this till you are farther advanced in life. It is one indication of an ingenuous mind, to be ready to give honor, to whom honor is due, as well as to merit it by worthy actions. God is plea&s;ed to ac|count him&s;elf honoured, by our love and obedience: our Saviour is al&s;o ho|noured thereby. Nor om I willing to believe, there are many &s;uch children of di&s;obedience here pre&s;ent, as have no &s;en&s;e of any obligation lying upon them, to honor their Father who is in heaven; the God that made, that pre&s;erves them, and who offers them the inheritance of children: this would &s;uppo&s;e them to
<PB N="217" REF="008667_0222_102fb09faa4b9748">
be "ba&s;tards and not &s;ons." Nor will I &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible for you to entertain a doubt, whether you ought to honor &s;o glorious a per&s;on, &s;o great a benefactor as Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who being rich, yet for your &s;akes became poor; enduring the cro&s;s, and de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame; and whom, being now, by the right hand of God exalted, we are all required to honor, to the glory of God the Father. To im|agine that you can call in que&s;tion your obligation to glorify God, and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, would be to &s;uppo&s;e you ba&s;e and degenerate to a great degree; quite contrary to the principle I &s;et out upon. It is therefore now taken for granted, that you own your&s;elves under obligation, to give all the honor you po&s;&s;ibly can, to tho&s;e who are &s;o worthy of it.</P>
<P>AND if you acknowledge this, let me a&s;k you, whether you know any other way, in which you can &s;o truly and ef|fectually honor God and your Redeemer, as by keeping the commandments? by living and acting as God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t require you to do? Our Saviour &s;ays,
<Q>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; &s;o &s;hall ye be my di&s;ciples.</Q>
And again:
<Q>If ye love me, keep my commandments.</Q>
You
<PB N="218" REF="008667_0223_102fb0a2f40d1e78">
&s;ee then, that you will, by doing thus, the mo&s;t effectually glorify God, and &s;hew your regard to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Is it not therefore incumbent upon you, even now, however young you may be, to turn your feet unto God's te&s;timonies; to make ha&s;te, and not delay, to keep his commandments? Would you not do more honor to him that made, and him that redeemed you by his blood, by en|tering on a life of religion now, than by doing it hereafter when you are old, if perhaps, you &s;hould live to become &s;o? If God is at all honored by the obedience of his creatures, certainly they who keep his commandments thro' the whole cour&s;e of their lives, honor him more than they, who neglect to do &s;o, till their lives are almo&s;t come to a period.</P>
<P>THAT you may be the more fully convinced of this, and plainly &s;ee, how much more God and our Saviour are glorified, by an early, than by a late conver&s;ion to the ways of wi&s;dom, I &s;hall here briefly &s;et them in contra&s;t; fir&s;t repre&s;enting to you the ca&s;e and character of One, who even in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> morning of life remembers his creator&punc; and &s;erves him faithfully thro' life; and then, of One, who delays his return to God, till age has almo&s;t put a period to

his days. There will be nothing very peculiar, or &s;ingular, in the&s;e characters; either with re&s;pect to the outward con|dition and circum&s;tances to the per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed, or with re&s;pect to the manner and means of their being reclaimed from the error of their ways, to the wi&s;dom of the ju&s;t; which would not &s;o well an&s;wer the propo&s;ed end, of general u&s;e.</P>
<P>FIRST then, Here is One, who, even in early youth, by a chri&s;tian education, has deep impre&s;&s;ions of religion made on his heart: And tho' he has not been more vicious than children commonly are, yet his con&s;cience is awakened and troubled, &s;o that he is inqui&s;itive

him&s;elf to his &s;ervice, and keep the com|mandments of his Redeemer. He not only re&s;olves; but puts his good re&s;olu|tions in practice. He immediately re|nounces all the vanities of childhood and youth: And has &s;o firm a belief of things invi&s;ible and eternal, as enables him to vanqui&s;h all temptations. He is a conqueror, while but a child: And being come to years, would, like Mo&s;es, rather &s;uffer affliction with the people of God, than enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;in for a &s;ea&s;on, and be called

<P>REFLECT a little on this character, wherein there is nothing romantic; no|thing over-done, or carried beyond real life; tho', it is confe&s;&s;ed, it is far from being &s;o common as were to be de&s;ired. The propo&s;ed contra&s;t thereto, follows.</P>
<P>HERE then, is another per&s;on, born and educated, like the former, in a chri|&s;tian country, and in a chri&s;tian manner; if you plea&s;e, his co-temporary, and neighbour: But how unlike him in o|ther re&s;pects! For tho' "from a child he has known the holy &s;criptures, which were able to make him wi&s;e unto &s;alva|tion," he practically di&s;regarded them till he became a man, yea, old and grey-headed. His childhood and youth were wholly given to vanity. He was never a &s;peculative unbeliever; but yet, while young, intirely addicted him&s;elf to tho&s;e "fle&s;hly lu&s;ts, which war again&s;t the &s;oul." When pa&s;t the meridian of his days, &s;chemes of worldly ambition, and world|ly wealth, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart; and chiefly employ'd his thoughts. In pro&s;ecuting the&s;e, he &s;tuck at none of the u&s;ual methods of intrigue, fal&s;hood
<PB N="222" REF="008667_0227_102fb0af1dab3ae8">
and calumny, of craft, oppre&s;&s;ion and fraud: Tho' &s;till, to prevent the lo&s;s of his reputation in a chri&s;tian country, he u&s;ed often to attend the public wor&s;hip; and was heard, more than once, to ex|pre&s;s him&s;elf with &s;eeming warmth, not only again&s;t our modern infidels; but again&s;t others, whom popular cen&s;ure calls innovators in religion, or men of un&s;ound and dangerous principles. How|ever, by a &s;eries of follies, vices and crimes, whereby he did much mi&s;chief in the world; and in which he grew &s;till more hardened and audacious with years, he made it evident to all who knew his practices, how little he feared God, or regarded man; or rather, how much he contemned both. But being now far advanced in life; having been di&s;appointed in mo&s;t of his worldly pro|jects; finding the infirmities of age come fa&s;t upon him; being apprehen&s;ive that, according to the cour&s;e of nature, death was at hand; reflecting on the greatne&s;s of his guilt, and fearing the wrath to come; being al&s;o alarmed by &s;ome a|wakening di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, he determines at length to reform his ways; and to do whatever he can, in the clo&s;e of life, to &s;ave his &s;oul.

He lives a little while after; ju&s;t long enough to make charitable people believe, he is a true penitent; and &s;o he dies; not, in|deed, in the full a&s;&s;urance of faith; nor yet without a degree of hope, that he &s;hall not be "condemned with the world."</P>
<P>THIS is the man, or character, which you are de&s;ired to compare with the for|mer; a common character, excepting the latter part of it: For I own, it is un|u&s;ual for tho&s;e, who have &s;o long lived the life of the wicked, at la&s;t to
<Q>die the death of the righteous.</Q></P>
<P>YOU cannot rea&s;onably make it a doubt, by which of the&s;e two per&s;ons God was mo&s;t glorified. The former glorified him, and was a credit to religion, from childhood to youth, from youth to mid|dle age, from middle age to old; and fi|nally in death; &s;till making it manife&s;t how great a regard he had for God and his laws. The latter, on the contrary, was a di&s;grace to the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion; and thro' him,
<Q>the name of God was bla&s;phemed <NOTE N="e" PLACE="marg">Rom. 2.24.</NOTE></Q>
by many. How many altars did he rai&s;e to lu&s;t, ambition, and mammon, the only deities to which he &s;acrificed, before ever he &s;eriou&s;ly tho't
<PB N="224" REF="008667_0229_102fb0b867dda488">
of giving glory to God? He plainly pre|ferred the &s;ervice of Satan, to that of God mo&s;t high, till he was almo&s;t pa&s;t &s;erving the former any longer, by rea&s;on of na|ture's decay, and the near approach of death. He could not, even at la&s;t, be &s;o properly &s;aid to have voluntarily for|&s;aken his &s;ins, and returned to God, as compell'd to do it, by the extremity of his condition. And if he glorified God at all, it was chiefly by being an example of his long-&s;uffering, and grace, in his for|givene&s;s and conver&s;ion, after having di&s;|honored and affronted him &s;o many years, by &s;uch a life.</P>
<P>A MORE particular compari&s;on was intended between the&s;e two characters; in order to &s;how, how much more honor accrues to God and our Redeemer by the former, than by the latter of them. But as there is hardly time for it, &s;o it is hoped, it is not nece&s;&s;ary. After laying the characters before you, your own rea&s;on, your own ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of things, will &s;ave me this labour; for, in your judgment, I am &s;ure, you cannot he&s;i|tate a moment, however you may be di&s;|po&s;ed in point of inclination.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t not clo&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e, without briefly &s;umming up the argu|ment of it; without drawing, and ur|ging,
<PB N="225" REF="008667_0230_102fb0ba73abf378">
the practical conclu&s;ion from the whole.</P>
<P>YOU will remember then, that I am not now &s;peaking to per&s;ons of a flagiti|ous and abandoned character; nor even to tho&s;e who are naturally of a dull and &s;ordid di&s;po&s;ition, almo&s;t all body, with|out &s;oul or &s;pirit: but to ingenuous youth, who have a lively &s;en&s;e of honor, of propriety and decorum, with their contraries; and who would be a&s;hamed to act a part, evidently ba&s;e and unwor|thy in their own apprehen&s;ions. Now you have &s;een, by what has been &s;aid above, that religion, being a rea&s;onable &s;ervice, is in it&s;elf becoming and hono|rable in all per&s;ons, at all times. You have &s;een that it is, in divers re&s;pects, pe|culiarly amiable and reputable in youth. You have &s;een what particular infamy attends, and ju&s;tly belongs to vicious age. And, la&s;tly, you have &s;een, how much more honor is done to God and our Redeemer, whom we are all bound to honor, by tho&s;e who early devote them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of God, than by tho&s;e who &s;erve the devil and their lu&s;ts, till age overtakes them. What, now, is the plain con&s;equence from the&s;e premi&s;es? Doubtle&s;s, That you ought to make ha&s;te, and not delay, to
<PB N="226" REF="008667_0231_102fb0bc0232a328">
turn your feet unto God's te&s;timonies, and keep his commandments. If you would acquire the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial glo|ry; if you would avoid the ju&s;te&s;t and greate&s;t infamy; if you would, as much as in you lies, do honor to God that made, and to Chri&s;t that redeemed you; if you would do all, or any of the&s;e things, you are immediately to for&s;ake your fooli&s;h and vicious practices, and to live henceforward, in the faith and fear of God, in obedience to his holy will.</P>
<P>AND what more forcible argument, or motive than this, could be u&s;ed to per|&s;wade per&s;ons of your ingenuous and generous temper, to be &s;peedy in turn|ing your feet unto God's te&s;timonies? What others need I urge? What others need I &s;o much as mention? Need I re|mind you, how precarious life is; and that you may very &s;oon and unexpected|ly be called out of this world, to give an account of your&s;elves to God? Need I tell you, that it will be far more irk&s;ome and difficult to reform your evil ways hereafter, than to do it now, even "while it is called to-day?" Need I tell you, that you will be far more hap|py in this world, in the practice of reli|gion, than you can po&s;&s;ibly be, in the
<PB N="227" REF="008667_0232_102fb0bf0c02ef98">
indulgence of your lu&s;ts? Need I a&s;&s;ure you, that there is a peculiar and great reward, laid up in heaven for tho&s;e, who faithfully &s;erve God from the morning to the eye of life? Need I &s;ugge&s;t to you, what bold and pre&s;umptuous im|piety it is, to per&s;i&s;t in di&s;obeying God's commandments, while his wrath is &s;o clearly
<Q>revealed from heaven again&s;t all ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men?</Q>
Need I mention any thing of the terrors of the Lord? Any thing, of that "rod of iron," with which har|dened, irreclaimable &s;inners, are to be ruled, or rather,
<Q>da&s;hed to pieces like a potter's ve&s;&s;el?</Q>
Any thing, of that
<Q>fire prepared for the devil and his an|gels,</Q>
into which the workers of ini|quity are to be ca&s;t? Any thing of that
<Q>outer darkne&s;s, where there &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth</Q>?</P>
<P>IS there any need to in&s;i&s;t on, or even to mention, &s;uch topics and motives as the&s;e, in order to per&s;wade per&s;ons of your ta&s;te and temper, to make ha&s;te, and not delay? No, &s;urely! they are calcu|lated for per&s;ons of a very different make; naturally void of ingenuity, or deeply immer&s;ed already in vice and impiety. With you, the argument of this di&s;cour&s;e will &s;upply the place of all others: You
<PB N="228" REF="008667_0233_102fb0c4eac24a00">
covet true, &s;ub&s;tantial glory: You dread de&s;erved infamy: You would, to the utmo&s;t of your power, do honor to your great and good Creator, to your merci|ful Redeemer. And being now convin|ced, that in order to the&s;e ends, you mu&s;t for&s;ake your &s;ins, and keep God's commandments, you will doubtle&s;s make ha&s;te, and not delay. You are now re|&s;olved, that you will not offend any more; that you will no longer violate the &s;acred laws of right rea&s;on, honor and gratitude, by with-holding your hearts, your love and obedience, from Him, to whom they are &s;o ju&s;tly due. You are now re&s;olved, that before your eyes are clo&s;ed with &s;leep, they &s;hall o|verflow with tears of ingenuous peni|tence, and godly &s;orrow, while you implore forgivene&s;s thro' Him, who was "once offered to bear the &s;ins of many;" and be&s;eech God, without whom you can, effectually, do nothing, to give you "a new heart;" to guide, and keep you, in the paths of righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace. It can hardly be doubted, but the&s;e are your pre&s;ent intentions and re&s;olutions; do not, I be&s;eech you, forget, but put them, in practice; that &s;o, thro' the a|bundant goodne&s;s of God, that &s;ame &s;un, which to-day aro&s;e on you,

<Q>&s;hine forth as the &s;un in the kingdom of their Fa|ther</Q>!</P>
<P>YOUR youth, and your turn of mind, leave &s;ome room for candor to hope, that your neglecting hitherto, what would be &s;o reputable to your&s;elves, and contribute &s;o much to the honor of Reli|gion, to the glory of God and your Re|deemer, is rather owing to want of con|&s;ideration and reflection, than to any thing wor&s;e; tho' that, indeed, is it&s;elf highly blameable. Surely, you did not well con&s;ider in what true glory con|&s;i&s;ts; you did not duly reflect, Who&s;e commandments you violated! Who&s;e Son you "trod under foot"! Who&s;e blood you "accounted an unholy thing!" Who&s;e good Spirit you "grieved"! Had you thoroughly thought of the&s;e things, doubtle&s;s you would, before this time, have turned your feet unto God's te&s;ti|monies. Wherefore, being now &s;o par|ticularly reminded of them, let them have their proper influence on your hearts; and depart not from the holy commandment delivered to you.

That it becomes us to make ha&s;te to keep God's com|mandments; and that all delay herein is utterly inexcu&s;able. The&s;e &s;everal to|pics, or heads of argument, having been dilated upon in &s;ome of the la&s;t preceed|ing di&s;cour&s;es, are now pa&s;&s;ed over with a bare mention.</P>
<P>ANOTHER argument is, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance to be handled in this di&s;cour&s;e, with the &s;ame general view: And this &s;hall be taken from a con&s;ideration of the ba&s;ene&s;s, the black ingratitude, of per|&s;evering in our &s;ins, while God allows us a &s;pace for repentance, and &s;hews &s;o much grace, pity and conde&s;cention to|wards us, as appear in the go&s;pel of his Son.</P>
<P>THIS argument has &s;ome affinity with that of the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e, and is a|dapted to operate on the &s;ame tempers,
<PB N="233" REF="008667_0238_102fb0d30fa44d90">
or per&s;ons of a like di&s;po&s;ition and cha|racter, with the former: I mean on per|&s;ons who have &s;ome ingenuity of mind; &s;ome &s;en&s;e of honor and decorum; and who, tho' of a vicious character, are not yet abandoned &mdash; Not on tho&s;e, who are of a &s;ervile and &s;ordid di&s;po&s;ition, or who are already hardned to a great degree in vice and impiety. The&s;e latter, equally regardle&s;s of God's honor, and of their own, would perhaps only &s;mile at our &s;implicity, if we &s;hould attempt to work upon them by &s;uch airy notions, and empty &s;peculations, as the&s;e are in their gro&s;s apprehen&s;ions. But there are ma|ny, at lea&s;t &s;ome, of a more ingenuous temper, who will feel a divine power and energy even in arguments of this kind; airy and un&s;ub&s;tantial, only in the conceptions of tho&s;e, who are either naturally of a fordid make, or who are plunged deep in vice and &s;en&s;uality, That any particular action, or cour&s;e of life, is ungrateful, that it is ba&s;e and di&s;|ingenuous, will be a con&s;ideration of great weight, even with many who are not of a virtuous character. And, cer|tainly, there is no ingratitude &s;o ba&s;e and infamous, as that of per&s;evering in di&s;obedience to God's commandments, con&s;idering his goodne&s;s, forbearance,

and long-&s;uffer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing towards us, and his grace revealed in the go&s;pel of our &s;alva|tion.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent argument may be ex|plained and enforced under the following ob&s;ervations; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>THAT God allows tho&s;e who have gone a&s;tray from his commandments, a &s;pace for repentance, that they may be reconciled to him, and happy in his fa|vor:</P>
<P>THAT he has given his own dear &s;on to &s;uffer and die for us:</P>
<P>THAT he conde&s;cends to invite, and, as it were, to intreat and be&s;eech &s;inners, to be reconciled to him:</P>
<P>THAT this is the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing goodne&s;s and conde&s;cention in him:</P>
<P>THAT it is, therefore, the ba&s;e&s;t in|gratitude in us to per&s;evere in our &s;ins from time to time: And con&s;equently,</P>
<P>THAT if we have any ingenuity of temper, or any &s;en&s;e of honor, it be|comes us to make ha&s;te, and not delay, to keep the commandments of our God: Which is the great point in view.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be &s;hort upon the&s;e particulars, &s;ince the compa&s;s of one di&s;|cour&s;e will not admit of any great en|largement on them.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="008667_0240_102fb0d7adc18810">To return therefore: GOD allows tho&s;e who have gone a&s;tray from his commandments, a &s;pace for repentance, that they may return to him, and be hap|py in his favor. We are all of us the witne&s;&s;es and monuments of this his le|nity, mercy and forbearance. We doubt|le&s;s began early to depart from the living God, and to break his commandments; for "childhood and youth are vanity". And &s;ome of us have, perhaps, been walking in vicious cour&s;es, even till old age has overtaken us therein: All which time, God has been waiting to be graci|ous. So that he not only allows a &s;pace for repentance to &s;inners in general, that they may make their peace with him, by turning their feet unto his te&s;timonies; but to &s;ome of them, he allows a long time for this purpo&s;e; if, indeed, human life can ever be called long. And to be &s;ure, half this term may well be looked upon as long, for the great and holy God to wait on his &s;inful, rebellious creatures, while he beholds them trampling on his laws; that they may &s;ee, and repent of their wicked deeds. For this is the end and de&s;ign of his forbearing thus with them. Were he not pitiful and gracious he would &s;peedily execute his righteous &s;entence again&s;t the evil works of men,
<PB N="236" REF="008667_0241_102fb0de275146f0">
in&s;tead of delaying it in the manner he does. In the language of the apo&s;tle Peter, He is "long-&s;uffering to us-ward, not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h; but that all &s;hould come to repentance".</P>
<P>GOD might, indeed, be &s;aid to be gra|cious and long-&s;uffering, tho' he allow'd &s;inners only the &s;pace of two or three years to think on their ways, and turn their feet unto his te&s;timonies. Are there many earthly monarchs, who exerci&s;e &s;uch forbearance towards their unrea&s;o|nable and rebellious &s;ubjects, having all the time full power to make them feel the due de&s;ert of their crimes? To be &s;ure, we do not often &s;ee &s;uch examples of lenity and forbearance in the poten|tates of this world. God's conduct to|wards us in this re&s;pect, fully verifies his own words: "My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, &s;aith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, &s;o are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">I&s;ai. 55.8, 9.</NOTE> This is &s;aid with particular reference to the patience and mercy of God towards &s;inners; which &s;o far exceeds that of men one towards another, who are common|ly ha&s;ty, and almo&s;t in&s;atiable, in aven|ging them&s;elves on their enemies. God
<PB N="237" REF="008667_0242_102fb0dfad2c83a0">
might make his power known, and glo|rify his ju&s;tice, in puni&s;hing our &s;ins as &s;oon as committed. But he had rather that we would turn and live; having no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked. He had rather make his mercy appear illu&s;|trious and glorious, by forbearing with us in our &s;ins for a time, and then pardon|ing them upon our repentance, than &s;hew his righteous &s;everity, by cutting us off in our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, without allowing us a &s;ea&s;on to reflect on our ways, and reform them. How backward he is to de&s;troy the wicked, and his great com|pa&s;&s;ion towards them, we may further learn from what he &s;aid to Ephraim and I&s;rael of old, [Ho&s;. xi.] "My people are bent to back&s;liding from me&mdash;How &s;hall I give thee up, Ephraim? how &s;hall I deliver thee I&s;rael? how &s;hall I make thee as Admah? how &s;hall I &s;et thee as Zeboim? my heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. I will not execute the fiercene&s;s of mine anger; I will not return to de&s;troy E|phraim: For I am God and not man; the holy One in the mid&s;t of thee." Impenitent &s;inners in general may here &s;ee the rea&s;on, why they are not yet cut off and de&s;troyed: It is not, becau&s;e they have not de&s;erved to be thus dealt with;

but becau&s;e they have to do with that God who&s;e mercy is infinite; and his forbearance unexampled among&s;t men.</P>
<P>BUT it will give us a &s;till more exal|ted idea of God's goodne&s;s and grace, if, in the next place, we reflect, That he has given his own dear Son to &s;uffer and die for us. So greatly has God loved this &s;inful world! So unwilling is he, that we &s;hould peri&s;h! So de&s;irous, to &s;peak after the manner of men, that we &s;hould obtain eternal life! In the language of the apo&s;tle Paul, "God was in Chri&s;t, reconciling the world unto him&s;elf, not imputing their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es unto them"&mdash; "For he hath made him to be &s;in [a &s;in-offering] for us, who knew no &s;in, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him." And again: "God com|mendeth his love towards us, &s;aith he, in that while we were yet &s;inners, Chri&s;t died for us." So the apo&s;tle John: "In this was manife&s;ted the love of God to|wards us, becau&s;e that God &s;ent his only begotten Son into the world; that we might live thro' him. Herein is love; not that we loved God, but that he lo|ved us, and &s;ent his Son to be the pro|pitiation for our &s;ins."</P>
<P>AND now, adhering to the Scripture-phra&s;e, could the love of God have been
<PB N="239" REF="008667_0244_102fb0e2c0e48400">
&s;o <HI>manife&s;ted</HI> to a guilty world, in any o|ther way, as it is in this? He loved us, indeed, anticedendy to Chri&s;t's coming into the world, and even antecedently to his de&s;ignation to the mediatorial of|fice. For this appointment it&s;elf took its ri&s;e from the love, and free grace of God; being the effect, not the cau&s;e thereof. And it was herein, that God's eternal love was made manife&s;t, vi&s;ible, or evident to mankind; <HI>viz.</HI> in his ac|tually &s;ending his Son into the world, in the fulne&s;s of time; a per&s;on of &s;uch excellence and dignity, and &s;o beloved by him, here to live a life of &s;orrow, and die a &s;hameful and accur&s;ed death, in order to reconcile us unto him&s;elf, and "bring many &s;ons unto glory." Taking it for granted, that God had a mo&s;t &s;in|cere and tender love for us, and concern for our eternal happine&s;s; taking this for granted, I &s;ay, a&s;k your&s;elves, whe|ther you can conceive of any other me|thod, in which he could &s;o effectually have &s;hown, and demon&s;trated this to the world, as that which he has actually taken to this end? Abraham manife&s;ted his great piety, in being ready to part&punc; with his only &s;on I&s;aac, at the call of God, when he was plea&s;ed to make that trial of his &s;incerity: "Now know I
<PB N="240" REF="008667_0245_102fb0ea9d86e620">
that thou feare&s;t God, &s;eeing thou ha&s;t not with-held thy &s;on, thine <HI>only</HI> &s;on, from me." <NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Gen. 22.12.</NOTE> This was the &s;tronge&s;t te&s;timony, the highe&s;t evidence, he could po&s;&s;ibly give of his &s;incenty, con&s;idering the great love which he had for his &s;on. In allu&s;ion to which &s;tory, we may ju&s;t|ly &s;ay, Now know we that God loveth us indeed, &s;eeing he hath not with-held his Son, his only Son from us. And he that &s;pared not his own Son, in whom he &s;o much delighted, but delivered him up for us all, how &s;hall he not with him al&s;o, freely give us all things? How &s;trong is that love? How great is that mercy? How rich is that grace, which has, in this way, been manife&s;ted to|wards us? Doubtle&s;s this is the &s;tronge&s;t evidence, the highe&s;t proof, which God could give, of his compa&s;&s;ion and mercy to the &s;inful children of men. I am &s;ure, you cannot conceive of any greater, more convincing, affecting, or a&s;toni&s;h|ing.</P>
<P>AND you know that the Son of God was manife&s;ted to take away our &s;ins, not only by bearing them in his own body on the tree, but by delivering us from the power and dominion thereof; that we might be purified unto him, a peculiar people, zealous of good works;

and &s;erve God in holine&s;s and in righte|ou&s;ne&s;s all the days of our lives. Can we then make too much ha&s;te? or, ra|ther, can we po&s;&s;ibly make ha&s;te enough, to co-operate with the de&s;igns of God's love in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, by turning our feet unto his te&s;timonies? How ungrateful are we to him, as well as unkind to our&s;elves, if we make any delay to keep his commandments?</P>
<P>BUT it is farther to be ob&s;erved, That God conde&s;cends mo&s;t earne&s;tly to in|vite, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, to intreat and be|&s;eech us, to be reconciled to him, as tho' his own happine&s;s depended upon our's.

What a&s;toni&s;hing language is this!&mdash; "Look unto the heavens, and &s;ee, and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. If thou &s;inne&s;t, what do&s;t thou again&s;t him?

why will ye die?" As if it were not enough for the great God, whom we have offended by our &s;ins, to give us a &s;pace and opportunity to make our peace with him; as if it were not enough for him, to have delivered up his own Son for us all; as if it were not enough for him, by his prophets and apo&s;tles, to proclaim to us his willingne&s;s to receive us into his favor, on our return to him: As if all this were not enough, I &s;ay, the great Lord of all does, as it were, conde&s;cend to become Him&s;elf a petiti|oner, and &s;upplicant, to his &s;inful crea|tures: He invites, hc per&s;uades, he ur|ges us, to return to him, and be happy, with more apparent tenderne&s;s and &s;olli|citude, than any earthly parent would invite a rebellious and prodigal &s;on to return, and receive the inheritance de|&s;igned for him.</P>
<P>WHY does God u&s;e &s;o many per&s;ua|&s;ions and intreaties, in order to effect a reconciliation, and to e&s;tabli&s;h peace, be|tween him&s;elf and us? Is this, becau&s;e he was the aggre&s;&s;or, the offending par|ty, to whom it of right belongeth to be fir&s;t in an overture to this end, and to make &s;upplication? No: He had done us no wrong, but great good; which we requited with evil. Did he fear any

harm would accrue to him, from our continued oppo&s;ition to him, and enmi|ty again&s;t him? No: He is far exalted above the reach of our impotent mad|ne&s;s; and could utterly de&s;troy us with one breath of his mouth. Did he expect to receive any benefit to him&s;elf, as the effect of this reconciliation? any aug|mentation of his perfections, or happi|ne&s;s? No: We are as unable to do him good, as harm; and are ab&s;olutely de|pendent upon his plea&s;ure, both for happine&s;s, and our very being. Does he think he &s;hould be left de&s;titute of &s;ubjects to reign over, if he &s;hould ac|tually de&s;troy, in&s;tead of reclaiming us to our allegiance? No: Tho' mankind were de&s;troyed from the earth, there are millions of glorious angels in heaven, that delight in doing his will; and he could ea&s;ily re-people this earth with other inhabitants: There is more <HI>du&s;t,</HI> out of which to form them; and the &s;ame <HI>breath</HI> that animated us, whereby "man became a living &s;oul <NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">Gen. 2.7.</NOTE>," is not yet exhau&s;ted! What then is the rea&s;on of God's dealing thus with us? Why does he u&s;e intreaties? Why is he &s;o de|&s;irous of reconciling this wicked and a|po&s;tate world unto him&s;elf? Why exer|ci&s;e &s;o much forbearance towards us?
<PB N="244" REF="008667_0249_102fb0e134561628">
The only rea&s;on hereof is, that he is in|finitely good, merciful and conde&s;cend|ing; and is not willing we &s;hould peri&s;h, how much &s;oever we have de&s;erved it.</P>
<P>UPON the whole then, the goodne&s;s and conde&s;cention of God towards his &s;inful creatures, are, as was &s;aid above, the great|e&s;t and mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing, that we can po&s;|&s;ibly conceive of. If we duly con&s;ider the greatne&s;s and maje&s;ty of God, our own littlene&s;s and vilene&s;s; and what it is for &s;uch worms of the du&s;t to tran&s;gre&s;s his laws; we may well be &s;urpri&s;ed, that he does not immdiately tread upon us, and cru&s;h us into the du&s;t again, out of which we were taken; I mean, upon our fir&s;t ri&s;ing up in oppo&s;ition to his will. Is it not &s;trange, that he &s;hould allow us any &s;pace at all for repentance? If it is not; yet, &s;urely, it is &s;urprizing, that his mer|cy and grace &s;hould be protracted to|wards us from year to year, to &s;uch long-&s;uffering. We &s;ee no grace, no lenity, no forbearance among&s;t men, which, all circum&s;tances being duly con&s;idered, will bear any compari&s;on with this: E|&s;pecially when we reflect, that God &s;till offers us, not only the forgivene&s;s of our pa&s;t offences, but eternal life and glory. But our admiration of his goodne&s;s and mercy, mu&s;t needs be &s;till heightened,
<PB N="245" REF="008667_0250_102f7502c4685b60">
by reflecting on that particular method, in which he has manife&s;ted this his mercy and grare to us; the method which he has cho&s;en for our redemption from &s;in, and mi&s;ery, and to bring us to glory. Did ever any earthly &s;overeign, from meer pity and compa&s;&s;ion to his rebel|lious, ill-de&s;erving &s;ubjects, deliver up an only begotten, and well-beloved &s;on, to &s;uffer and die in their room, as a ran|&s;om for them, that they might live, and yet the honor of his laws and govern|ment be maintained? There is no ex|ample of &s;uch conde&s;cention and grace, but in almighty God, the Father of mer|cies, towards us, when we were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins.</P>
<P>HOWEVER; allowing for the pre&s;ent, that we could call to mind &s;omething &s;imilar hereto, in the conduct of certain earthly potentates towards their rebelli|ous &s;ubjects; yet can we recollect an in|&s;tance of any king's continuing to i&s;&s;ue out acts of grace, from year to year, in favour of his rebel-&s;ubjects, after having once given them &s;uch a proof of his le|nity and goodne&s;s; &s;till inviting them to return to their duty and allegiance, and to accept his mercy? Can we think of any examples of tho&s;e, who in &s;uch a ca&s;e have become, as it were, &s;uppli|cants
<PB N="246" REF="008667_0251_102fafba5ae3e558">
to their di&s;loyal and traiterous &s;ub|jects, praying and be&s;eeching them for a long cour&s;e of time, to lay a&s;ide their unrea&s;onable oppo&s;ition, and to &s;ubmit them&s;elves? Tho' it mu&s;t be &s;till &s;up|po&s;ed, that this was not for the injured monarch's, but for their own advantage; and that, all this time, he had &s;ufficient power, and might with the greate&s;t ea&s;e, as well as ju&s;tice, have avenged him&s;elf on them: For otherwi&s;e the ca&s;es will not be parallel. I am &s;ure you cannot call to remembrance any &s;uch examples of goodne&s;s and conde&s;cention, in the kings and potentates of this world.</P>
<P>BUT altho' you could do &s;o, &s;till you will allow that there is &s;ome difference between them, and the king eternal, im|mortal and invi&s;ible, the only wi&s;e God; &s;ome difference between mens rebelling again&s;t tho&s;e, who are weak and mortal creatures as well as them&s;elves, and re|belling again&s;t the King of heaven; &s;ome difference between the former's &s;tooping to intreat their unrea&s;onable &s;ubjects to be reconciled to them, and God's be|&s;eeching us to be reconciled to Him: So that, after all, there is, and mu&s;t be, a very wide and e&s;&s;ential difference between the two ca&s;es. There neither are, not can in nature be, any examples of grace or

conde&s;cention among men, in their con|duct towards each other, however great in appearance, which will, on due con|&s;ideration, come up in any mea&s;ure to that which God exerci&s;es towards his &s;inful creatures. All &s;uch examples mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, fall infinitely &s;hort; infi|nitely below the divine pattern and ori|ginal; becau&s;e God is infinitelv greater than man. We cannot, therefore, as I &s;aid before, even conceive of any other goodne&s;s, grace and conde&s;cention, &s;o great and a&s;toni&s;hing, as that which God has manife&s;ted towards us, in allowing us a &s;ea&s;on for repentance; in giving his Son to die for us; in waiting &s;o long with us; and in thus intreating us to be at peace with him. As the heavens are high above the earth, &s;o does the grace of Him, whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain, exceed all other grace and goodne&s;s: "There is none good but One: that is God."</P>
<P>FROM whence it clearly follows, as was &s;aid before, that it is the ba&s;e&s;t, the blacke&s;t ingratitude in us, to per&s;evere in our &s;ins again&s;t him from time to time, that can be conceived of.

to the degree of his goodne&s;s to us, and the obligations which he has laid us under.

This, as far as I am able to &s;ee, is a true and ju&s;t &s;tate of the ca&s;e, de&s;titute of all fal&s;e colouring and glo&s;&s;ing. If God is infinitely greater in him&s;elf, and infinitely better to us, than any o|ther being is, or can be; our ingratitude to him, in continuing to rebel again&s;t him, mu&s;t of con&s;equence be infinitely more &s;ordid and ba&s;e, than any we can po&s;&s;ibly be guilty of, towards any other benefac|tor, whether friend, parent or king; whether man, or mini&s;tring angel.

<P>THE practical conclu&s;ion from the whole, therefore, and the &s;um of the pre&s;ent argument, is this; That if we have any ingenuity of mind, or any &s;en&s;e of honor, it becomes us to make ha&s;te, and not delay to keep the commandments of our God. It is now taken for granted, that you, for whom this di&s;cour&s;e is more e&s;pecially de&s;igned, would not willingly be thought ba&s;e and &s;ordid in your na|ture and di&s;po&s;ition; that you would not lie under the reproach and infamy, of having treated a benefactor ill, and re|quited him evil for good, even tho' you were never to incur any other harm thereby, than to be ju&s;tly accounted di&s;|ingenuous and ba&s;e.

temper, or, in one word, ungrateful. If you would not be a&s;hamed of this, you are not the per&s;ons to whom the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e is chiefly directed. It is, more|over, now taken for granted, that you believe God is your greate&s;t benefactor, your be&s;t friend; that he waits to be gracious to you; that he has given his own Son to die for your redemption from &s;in and death; that he invites you to ac|cept of eternal life; and that he conde|&s;cends even to intreat you to be reconci|led unto him. If I did not take it for granted, that you believe all the&s;e things, I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e you to be di&s;believers of the chri&s;tian revelation in general; which I would by no means do, without ha|ving &s;ome &s;trong and po&s;itive proof of your infidelity: becau&s;e as you have had a chri&s;tian education, and opportunity to know its truth and evidences, your di&s;belief of it would infer &s;omething ve|ry wrong, either in your heads or hearts, if not in both.

<P>WHAT pains will not per&s;ons of a grateful and ingenuous turn of mind take, to plea&s;e and gratify tho&s;e, who have &s;hown them great favour and kind|ne&s;s? who appear'd their friends in a time of affliction and trouble? who, when they were fallen into adver&s;ity, lent them a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and exerted them&s;elves in their &s;ervice? People of an ingenuous di&s;po|&s;ition, never think they can do too much by way of return to tho&s;e, who have laid them under peculiar obligations; or be too ready and forward to oblige them. And I doubt not but that you have, &s;ometimes, taken much pains, to gratify tho&s;e, who had done kind offices for you, tho' not very con&s;iderable in them|&s;elves; and even been &s;orry that you could not do more for them. How &s;trange is it then, if you are not &s;ollici|tous to make a proper return to your Father in heaven, for his manifold mer|cies; &s;aying, "What &s;hall I render to the Lord for all his benefits?" Should you not be infinitely more de&s;irous to plea&s;e him, by doing his will, than you are to

<P>YOU, perhaps, frequently hear per|&s;ons blamed for their ungratitude, and cen&s;ured for u&s;ing their benefactors ill: Yea, perhaps you often blame others for their unworthy treatment of your&s;elves; for not making &s;uitable returns to your kindne&s;s, and the obligations which you have laid them under. All this may be very ju&s;t; for I am not in&s;en&s;ible that this is indeed a very evil and ungrateful world, that we live in: And not only you, but others in general, look upon per&s;ons of an ingrateful temper, with a mixture of contempt and indignation, as &s;ome of the ba&s;e&s;t, vile&s;t, and mo&s;t brui|ti&s;h of men.

commandments, has already been argu|ed from the &s;everal con&s;iderations fol|lowing, in as many different di&s;cour&s;es; viz.

Each of the&s;e con&s;iderati|ons in particular, but more e&s;pecially all of them in conjunction, &s;how the im|portance of making ha&s;te to keep the commandments of God. But they are now only mentioned, having before been handled, and urged with &s;ome extent.</P>
<P>IT is propo&s;ed, by God's leave and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to urge one argument more, with the &s;ame general de&s;ign, or to the &s;ame end, in the en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e. And this &s;hall be drawn from a con&s;ide|ratio of the bold impiety of per&s;evering in our &s;inful cour&s;es, while God admo|ni&s;heth us to break them off by repen|tance;

together with the hazard there is, that &s;uch audacious contemners of his di&s;plea&s;ure, will be utterly for&s;aken of him, and left to fill up the dreadful mea|&s;ure their iniquities; being quite har|dened thro' the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in, long continued in again&s;t light; and having their "con&s;ciences &s;eared as with a hot iron". Some hints to this purpo&s;e have, I believe, been occa&s;ionally dropped, in &s;ome of the preceeding di&s;cour&s;es on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject: But the argument &s;eems to de&s;erve a more di&s;tinct con&s;ideration, and to be treated with greater extent, being very important in it's nature.</P>
<P>SOME of the la&s;t arguments were cal|culated, and de&s;igned, to operate upon the minds of per&s;ons who are naturally of an ingenuous temper, and who are not yet gone far in the paths of &s;in, ra|ther than upon per&s;ons of a crabbed, &s;our, and &s;ordid di&s;po&s;ition, or &s;uch as have greatly corrupted them&s;elves, by a long habit of &s;inning. And it is hoped that &s;uch arguments may, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, have their intended effect on that &s;ort of per&s;ons, for whom they were de&s;igned. The pre&s;ent argument is of a &s;omewhat different kind; as it is pri|marily, and principally, intended for per&s;ons of a different character; namely,
<PB N="263" REF="008667_0268_102faff1288980a0">
for tho&s;e, if there are any &s;uch here pre|&s;ent before God, who are little or no|thing affected with a &s;en&s;e of their ma|ker's goodne&s;s, forbearance and long-&s;uffering; being de&s;titute of all ingenui|ty, and genero&s;ity of temper; or who are already vicious and corrupt to a great degree. There is &s;carce any other way of coming at per&s;ons of this latter cha|racter, but by alarming their fears, and &s;hewing them the great danger they are in, of being &s;oon rejected of God, and finally incurring an aggravated condem|nation.</P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary that pre&s;umptuous tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, who have no &s;en&s;e of &s;hame or honor, and no fear of God before their eyes, &s;hould be admoni&s;hed to con&s;ider, how terrible the maje&s;ty of that God is, whom they dare thus to affront and pro|voke; what danger there is, that they will be given over by him to a repro|bate mind; and at length be ca&s;t into hell-fire; where &s;uch in&s;olent defiers of their maker's di&s;plea&s;ure will, except they repent, be puni&s;hed with a &s;everity proportionable to their daring impieties. However, I would not be mi&s;under&s;tood here: Tho' I de&s;ign to &s;peak with all po&s;&s;ible freedom and plainne&s;s upon this head, I am far from intending to deba&s;e

preaching by &s;colding, or "bringing a railing accu&s;ation," even again&s;t wicked and ungodly men. Nor will I forget the apo&s;tle's admonition to Timothy, "Re|buke not an elder [or aged per&s;on] but intreat him as a father": As, I hope, I have not forgotten what he immediately &s;ubjoins &mdash; "and the younger men as brethren". We had &s;colding and rail|ing preaching enough in the town and country, but a few years &s;ince, to &s;uffice for a long time; when it &s;eemed to be fa&s;hionable to violate all the rules of de|corum and mode&s;ty in the pulpit; and he was commonly thought to have the mo&s;t zeal for God, who had lea&s;t regard to decency in addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to men.</P>
<P>NOW, for the illu&s;tration of the pre|&s;ent argument, it will be proper briefly to remind you, both of the greatne&s;s and maje&s;ty of God, and of the littlene&s;s and weakne&s;s of man, From whence will be&s;t appear the bold impiety, and audaci|ou&s;ne&s;s, of men's per&s;evering in the breach of his known commandments, while he admoni&s;hes them to repent, and amend their ways. Something will then be ad|ded concerning the danger of God's be|ing provoked wholly to withdraw his Holy Spirit from &s;uch, and to give them up intirely to their own hearts lu&s;ts; as

al&s;o, concerning the aggravated perdi|tion of tho&s;e, who have &s;pent a long life in &s;inning again&s;t God, without repent|ing at la&s;t, to give him glory.

<P>TO return then: Let me briefly remind you of the greatne&s;s and maje&s;ty of God; which appear, both by his mighty works which men behold, and from his &s;acred oracles. How wi&s;e, powerful and great, mu&s;t that Being be, who created the heavens and the earth, with all that they contain? this mighty univer&s;e, which, to our &s;en&s;es, appears boundle&s;s and in|finite? And you know, that he who made, upholds and governs all things, can, if he plea&s;es, de&s;troy them with e|qual ea&s;e. What power can be compa|red with his, who is omnipotent? What wi&s;dom may be likened to that of the only wi&s;e God? What greatne&s;s is com|men&s;urate with his, whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain? What do|minion, and maje&s;ty, and glory, may be re&s;embled to that of almighty God, who&s;e dominion is everla&s;ting, who&s;e
<PB N="266" REF="008667_0271_102faffac43ec6d8">
kingdom ruleth over all, and who has &s;et his glory above the heavens? Reflect &s;oberly upon the works of God, and the &s;ublime repre&s;entations which the holy &s;criptures give us of his perfections, and the "glorious maje&s;ty of his kingdom;" and then, altho' you may po&s;&s;ibly be at a lo&s;s, which proclaims his power and greatne&s;s the mo&s;t, yet you will be filled with a&s;toni&s;hment at both; and be &s;en|&s;ible that all nations are, indeed, as no|thing before him; yea, "le&s;s than no|thing and vanity."</P>
<P>FOR, what a little, incon&s;iderable creature man is, in compari&s;on of his Maker, I was, in the next place, to re|mind you.
<Q>When I con&s;ider the hea|vens, &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the &s;tars which thou ha&s;t ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the &s;on of man that thou vi&s;ite&s;t him?</Q>
This is a very natural reflec|tion: For nothing can give us &s;o ju&s;t a &s;en&s;e of our own littlene&s;s, and in&s;igni|ficance, as con&s;idering the power and greatne&s;s of God.&mdash;"What is man!"&mdash; A reptile of a day; a child of du&s;t, bro't forth in &s;orrow and tears; altogether helple&s;s in his infancy; cru&s;hed before the moth, even in youth; in old age,
<PB N="267" REF="008667_0272_102faffc4b32a360">
burthened by the gra&s;s-hopper; and in his be&s;t e&s;tate, altogether vanity! He pretends to be wi&s;e, but is ever lo&s;t in error; his knowledge is but ignorance; his &s;trength weakne&s;s; his health and di&s;ea&s;e almo&s;t the &s;ame; his pains tor|menting; his very plea&s;ures vexatious; his birth and death but an hand-breadth a&s;under; to-day, boa&s;ting him&s;elf of to-morrow; and to-morrow the food of vermin, the worm feeding &s;weetly on him!&mdash;Such is man; wholly mean and vile; excepting that he is animated by the breath of God; and that his Maker has been &s;o mindful of him, as to give his own Son to redeem him. Which lat|ter con&s;ideration, while it &s;eems to give us &s;ome degree of &s;ignificance and im|portance in the creation, may, at the &s;ame time, &s;erve for our humiliation: &s;ince it was the &s;infulne&s;s and wretched|ne&s;s of our condition, that were the ground or occa&s;ion of God's manife&s;ting &s;uch a regard to us. And, indeed, we are not to e&s;timate our&s;elves, or our real worth, by what God has, in his grace and conde&s;cention done for us (accord|ing to which rule of judging, we &s;hould be creatures of great dignity and impor|tance;) but by what we are in our&s;elves naturally, and independently thereof;
<PB N="268" REF="008667_0273_102fb000f65a2770">
according to which, we mu&s;t needs ac|count our&s;elves little, vile and contemp|tible creatures, how prone &s;oever we may be to think highly of our&s;elves.

<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Job 35.5, 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE more we know of God and of our&s;elves, the greater di&s;tance &s;hall we perceive between him and us; and the more readily &s;hall we acquie&s;ce in the ju&s;tice of tho&s;e &s;entiments, which a&s;cribe to him, all glory, maje&s;ty, might, and dominion; and to our&s;elves, weakne&s;s, vilene&s;s and unworthine&s;s.</P>
<P>NOW, having thus briefly reminded you of the greatne&s;s and glory of God, and the littlene&s;s and vilene&s;s of man; you may from hence, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, conceive what pre&s;umption, what mad|ne&s;s it is, for &s;inners to per&s;evere in af|fronting him, by a continued violation of his commandments, notwith&s;tanding his repeated threatnings. The boldne&s;s and pre&s;umption of any one's conduct to|wards a &s;uperior, is to be e&s;timated by
<PB N="269" REF="008667_0274_102fb005e95081f0">
the di&s;tance which there is between them; by the relative greatne&s;s and power, or littlene&s;s and weakne&s;s, of the one to the other. According to which rule judg|ing, tho' we may in &s;ome mea&s;ure con|ceive, yet it will be impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s, the amazing pre&s;umption of man's wil|fully continuing to offend his Creator; the di&s;tance between them being infinite. For &s;uch an inferior and weak creature as man, to ri&s;e up in rebellion again&s;t the almighty Lord of the univer&s;e; and not only once to rebel, but to repeat his acts of rebellion from year to year; to trample upon the authority of Him, with|out who&s;e &s;u&s;taining hand, he would in|&s;tantly drop into nothing, from whence he is &s;o little removed; to de&s;pi&s;e his awful threatnings; and, in the language of &s;cripture, to run even upon "the thick bo&s;&s;es of his buckler," as tho' he "had an arm like God, or could thunder with a voice like him;" for weak, mortal man thus to contemn, thus to provoke Him, before whom Cherubim and Sera|phim bow with veiled faces; and from who&s;e frown apo&s;tate angels would, were it po&s;&s;ible, hide them&s;elves even in the lowe&s;t depths of hell;&mdash;&s;urely, it is not po&s;&s;ible, I &s;ay, for words fully to &s;et forth the impious madne&s;s of &s;uch a con|duct!</P>

What compari&s;on can we think of, which will not rather tend to le&s;&s;en the pre&s;umption thereof, than to place it in a ju&s;t and proper light? Shall we &s;ay, this is as if a &s;ervant, who had di&s;obey'd his ma&s;ters command, and who, being threatned that he &s;hould be beaten with many &s;tripes, unle&s;s he returned to his duty, &s;hould intirely di&s;regard the&s;e threatnings, and even grow more idle and in&s;olent? No: this compari&s;on would not an&s;wer; but tend to dimini&s;h, rather than to illu&s;trate, the guilt and horror of &s;uch pre&s;umptuous &s;inners con|duct.

Neither will &s;imilitude &s;erve the purpo&s;e; becau&s;e there is &s;till an infinitely greater di&s;tance between God and man, than there is between the highe&s;t arch-angel, and the lea&s;t reptile of the earth. All that is fabled of the giants of old, mak|ing war again&s;t heaven, is more than realized in the mad pre&s;umption of wick|ed men: for tho&s;e were &s;uppo&s;ed to be creatures of far greater power than or|dinary men, while the gods of the hea|then, again&s;t whom they were &s;uppo&s;ed to wage war, were not to be compared to our God, tho' "among the &s;ons of the mighty."

<P>NOW when we con&s;ider the great pre&s;umption, and daring impiety, of men's continuing from time to time, to trample upon God's commandments; does there not &s;eem to be danger, that he may be provoked to withdraw his holy Spirit intirely from &s;uch, and to leave them wholly to them&s;elves; the certain con&s;equence of which, will be the de|&s;truction of their &s;ouls? It is here taken for granted, that God's Spirit &s;trives with &s;inners in general, in conjunction with his word and providence, and their own rea&s;on, in order to reclaim them from their wicked ways. But are we &s;ure that he will continue always thus to &s;trive with them by his Spirit, while they live in this world? Are we &s;ure that he will not for&s;ake, and give them over, before they are taken hence to be here no more? Has he promi&s;ed, that he will not do &s;o? Certainly he has not; &s;o that they can have no a&s;&s;urance, that he will not: And this is what pre&s;ump|tuous &s;inners have great rea&s;on to fear may be the &s;ad con&s;equence of their da|ring impiety. I &s;ay, the &s;ad con&s;equence of it; becau&s;e &s;hould this be the ca&s;e,

<P>THERE are, if I mi&s;take not, &s;ome plain intimations in &s;cripture, that God does actually, &s;ometimes, thus for&s;ake the pre&s;umptuous tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of his laws; and warnings and admonitions given us to this purpo&s;e, le&s;t we &s;hould too far abu&s;e his goodne&s;s and patience.

Yea, is not God &s;poken of in &s;cripture as hardening the hearts of &s;inners, already obdurate?

Upon the fore|going &s;uppo&s;itions, if true, as they doubt|le&s;s are, being grounded on &s;cripture,
<PB N="276" REF="008667_0281_102fb01a0ac76a28">
the final &s;tate of &s;uch per&s;ons is already fixed, as much as the &s;tate of tho&s;e, who are already taken out of this world in their &s;ins: Tho' we u&s;ually &s;peak in ge|neral of &s;inners being in a &s;tate of pro|bation, during the whole term of their life here on earth. Which can be ju&s;t and proper only in this &s;en&s;e, that a truly penitent and reformed &s;inner &s;hall obtain mercy thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whenever he becomes &s;o, tho' it be on a death-bed, and in his la&s;t moments. In this &s;en&s;e our &s;tate of trial, or &s;ea&s;on of grace, is doubt|le&s;s commen&s;urate with the pre&s;ent life. But neverthele&s;s it may in reality be over, before our lives are run out; and is in effect &s;o, whenever our repen|tance and conver&s;ion to God, are ren|der'd morally and naturally impo&s;&s;ible, by the total and final withdrawing of his Spirit from us. And how long &s;oever per&s;ons may live after being thus given over of God, they are left only to fill up their &s;ins, and &s;it them&s;elves thereby for a more aggravated condemnation here|after: As good men, who are already pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life, are left here that they may perfect holine&s;s in the fear of God, and thereby become entitled to a greater reward in heaven.

Tho' it will by no means follow from hence, that they are not, even in this &s;tate of dere|liction, accountable for their conduct; or that they may not be ju&s;tly puni&s;hed for the &s;ins which they commit, after being thus given over to their own hearts lu&s;t. They are &s;till in a capacity to incur guilt, tho' not in a capacity of obtaining eternal life, or the &s;alvation of the go&s;pel. Altho' by the &s;uppo&s;iti|ons gone upon, they have already "&s;in|ned unto death," they may &s;till go on &s;inning; and "trea&s;uring up unto them|&s;elves wrath again&s;t the day of wrath:" And if we certainly knew of any parti|cular per&s;ons in this &s;tate, "I &s;ay not that we &s;hould pray for them <NOTE N="f" PLACE="marg">John 5&punc;16.</NOTE>," any more than for the wicked actually dead, and gone to "their own place."</P>
<P>Now, not to u&s;e many exclamations on the point, the&s;e are mo&s;t awful con|&s;iderations, and highly de&s;erve the &s;eri|ous

awakened attention of all tho&s;e, who &s;in pre&s;umptuou&s;ly again&s;t God; e&s;pecially of &s;uch as have already long abu&s;ed his mercy and patience, grieving that good Spirit, by which others are "&s;ealed to the day of redemption." For tho' their death may po&s;&s;ibly be at a great di&s;tance; yet how nigh may that time be, when God, whom they have for&s;aken, &s;hall wholly for&s;ake them; when he &s;hall ca&s;t them off forever, "&s;wearing in his wrath, that they &s;hall never enter into his re&s;t;" as he once &s;ware concerning &s;ome of the rebellious I&s;raelites in the wilderne&s;s!</P>
<P>BUT, as was ob&s;erved above, this de|&s;erves the &s;erious con&s;ideration of all pre&s;umptuous &s;inners without exception: For tho' &s;uch as have long gone on in their evil ways, &s;eem to be more e&s;pe|cially concerned in it; yet it is to be re|membred, that God has fixed, and made known to us, no certain &s;pace, or mea|&s;ure of time, wherein his Spirit &s;hall &s;trive with &s;inners re&s;pectively, any more than he has made known to us, how long we are re&s;pectively to live. We are as ignorant of the former, as we are of the latter; and there may po&s;&s;i|bly be as great a variety in his dealings with &s;inners, with reference to one of
<PB N="279" REF="008667_0284_102fb024439459f0">
the&s;e things, as there certainly is with reference to the other; I mean the re|&s;pective duration of their lives. There are &s;ome per&s;ons who, even in youth, make a &s;ad, a &s;urpri&s;ing progre&s;s in vice and impiety; and who are apparently hardened to a great degree, thro' the de|ceitfulne&s;s of &s;in. And &s;ome, even of the&s;e, may po&s;&s;ibly be near the time wherein God &s;hall finally give them over, except they repent. Yea, for any thing we can tell to the contrary, there may be &s;ome among the&s;e, as well as among more aged and veteran &s;inners&punc; whom God has already actually thus given up to their own hearts lu&s;ts; with whom his Spirit &s;hall no more &s;trive.&mdash;God for|bid, there &s;hould be any &s;uch abandoned, &s;uch lo&s;t and undone, &s;uch irreparably lo&s;t and undone &s;inners, among&s;t us, whether young or old! But whether there are or not, God only knows. &mdash; All have at lea&s;t &s;ome rea&s;on to fear that this may be their own wretched ca&s;e, who have long been &s;inning a|gain&s;t God with an high hand, and yet have now no con&s;iderable remor&s;e of con&s;cience; no concern about their &s;al|vation; no de&s;ire to reform their ways. This ea&s;e and &s;ecurity in &s;in, is a proof that God's Spirit is, in a great mea&s;ure,
<PB N="280" REF="008667_0285_102fb02753a73830">
actually withdrawn from them already; and gives, at lea&s;t, &s;ome ground to fear, that it may 'ere long totally and finally for&s;ake them: And then, "good were it for &s;uch, if they had never been born!"</P>
<P>LET none therefore, whether old or young, pre&s;ume to harden their hearts again&s;t God another day, another hour, or moment; le&s;t the divine patience &s;hould have a period put to it, before a period is put to their audacious offences again&s;t the high and holy God. Wo be to that man, whoever, or wherever he be, who is thus finally for&s;aken of God. Tho' he may perhaps live long, and be quiet from any fear of evil; enjoying both outward pro&s;perity, and carnal peace within, his heart being waxed gro&s;s, and his con&s;cience &s;eared, he is only as an ox in the &s;tall, uncon&s;ciou&s;ly and &s;tupidly nouri&s;hing him&s;elf for the day of &s;laughter!</P>
<P>THIS brings me, in the next place, to remind you of the aggravated condem|nation which awaits tho&s;e, who have &s;pent a long life in di&s;obedience to God's commandments; I mean tho&s;e, who have provoked God by their repeated and pre&s;umptuous &s;ins, to withdraw his Holy Spirit from them, and who die at la&s;t, laden both with iniquity and years.
<PB N="281" REF="008667_0286_102fb02dc6bfdff0">
It doubtle&s;s becomes us to re&s;pect the hoary head, e&s;pecially when found in the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s. But the Ancient of days pays no reverence to age as &s;uch, any more than to youth; and you know what he has &s;aid concerning the "&s;inner of an hundred years old," &s;o that it need not be here repeated. It is in general very evident, that they who live long without thinking on their ways, &s;o as to turn their feet unto God's te&s;timonies, and who at la&s;t die in their &s;ins, mu&s;t needs have a much greater weight of guilt lying upon them, than they who die in youth, altho' the lives of the lat|ter have al&s;o been "among the unclean." And by how much more guilt any have incurred during this probationary &s;tate, by &s;o much &s;orer a puni&s;hment, we may be &s;ure, they will be thought worthy in the day of retribution, when every man &s;hall be judged according to his works. And thus, altho' a man may now think him&s;elf, both the more happy and ho|nourable for living long; yet the time may at length come, when he &s;hall have rea&s;on to wi&s;h that he died, like many others, in youth; yea, when he &s;hall have much more cau&s;e than ever Job had, to &s;ay,

&mdash; This may po&s;&s;ibly be the &s;ad ca&s;e of any particular per&s;on, who now goes on pre&s;umptuou&s;ly in his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. And there is great rea&s;on to fear, it will actually be the ca&s;e of tho&s;e, who have already lived to old age, and have not yet remembred their Creator, whom they ought to have re|membred even in the days of their youth, before the&s;e evil days came, wherein the mo&s;t may truly &s;ay, that they "have no plea&s;ure in them"; e&s;pecially tho&s;e who, in the decline of life, are de&s;titute of the hopes and comforts of religion. It is probable there are but few per&s;ons, com|paratively &s;peaking, who live in the known violation of God's command|ments till old age, then turn their feet unto his te&s;timonies. So that tho' the &s;tate of &s;uch is not ab&s;olutely de&s;perate, yet it is extremely hazardous and me|lancholy.</P>
<P>BUT I now proceed, in the la&s;t place, more particularly to draw and enforce the practical inference from what has been &s;aid in this di&s;cour&s;e. It is this: The&s;e things being con&s;idered, it highly concerns all, e&s;pecially the aged, who
<PB N="283" REF="008667_0288_102fb0310c604620">
have delayed &s;o long already, now to think on their ways, and make ha&s;te to keep God's commandments. Rea&s;on allows of no delays in religion. Rea&s;on &s;hows all, of every age, the importance of devoting them&s;elves immediately to the &s;ervice of God. If God is always the &s;ame almighty, all-wi&s;e, holy, ju&s;t and good Being; and if we are always de|pendent upon him, certainly he is al|ways to be reverenced and obeyed by all his creatures. There is no time, or moment of life, whether early or late, wherein we can excu&s;e our&s;elves in the neglect of him, or in breaking any one of his commandments, tho' it were the lea&s;t; to do which pre&s;umptuou&s;ly, were practically to renounce his authority, or to deny that he is God. And when, in conformity to what has been &s;aid above, you &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider his greatne&s;s and maje&s;ty; and your own weakne&s;s and littlene&s;s in compari&s;on of him; when you con&s;ider the audaciou&s;ne&s;s, or rather the madne&s;s, of per&s;evering in trampling on his laws, while he admoni&s;hes, and threatens, and, as it were, &s;hews you his hand full of thunder and vengeance; when you duly con&s;ider the great dan|ger there is, that he will be provoked by your continuing to grieve and affront his

good Spirit, intirely to take it from you, with the dreadful con&s;equences hereof; when you con&s;ider the aggravated guilt which you will incur, by &s;pending a long life, if &s;uch an one &s;hould be allowed you, in &s;inning again&s;t God; together with the real danger there is, according to what has been found true in all ages, that being grown old in impiety and vice, you will not then effectually reform your evil ways, tho' there is a po&s;&s;ibility of it; but only fill up the mea&s;ure of your ini|quities, and &s;o be finally wretched in proportion to the duration of the &s;pace allowed you for repentance: When you &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the&s;e things, I &s;ay, it is impo&s;&s;ible but that you mu&s;t acknow|ledge the ju&s;tne&s;s of the conclu&s;ion be|fore-mentioned; viz. that you &s;hould lo&s;e no more time; that you &s;hould make no longer delay; that you &s;hould not harden your hearts again&s;t God ano|ther moment; but make ha&s;te to keep his holy commandments. Will any pre|&s;ume to &s;ay, or even to think, that there is no occa&s;ion for making &s;peed, when God warns, threatens, and admoni&s;hes us to fly for refuge? Can any think them&s;elves prudent, or &s;afe, in once more grieving that "holy Spirit of di&s;ci|pline," which may then be utterly with|drawn

<P>THESE things being duly con&s;idered, what can be &s;aid in excu&s;e, even for the young, if they delay their repentance, and their return to God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t? I know of nothing, unle&s;s per|haps it be, that they are be&s;ide them|&s;elves, and "know not what they do." They who are already arrived at middle age, are &s;till le&s;s excu&s;able than youth, upon any principles of rea&s;on; or, unle&s;s they would avail them&s;elves of the apolo|gy ju&s;t now mentioned, viz. that they are mad, which is the be&s;t, or rather the only tolerable one that I can think of. But what is the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing of all, is, that there &s;hould be many aged per&s;ons in the chri&s;tian world, people already bowed down with years and infirmities, and on the very con&s;ines of another world, who &s;eem to think, that even They have no need to make ha&s;te, but may &s;till de|lay

<P>I WOULD willingly hope, that there are no &s;uch per&s;ons as the&s;e la&s;t mention|ed, now pre&s;ent in this a&s;&s;embly.

A&s;k your&s;elves&punc; I be&s;eech you, whether you have indeed turned your feet unto God's te&s;timonies? whether you now live in a con&s;cientious obedience to all his known commandments? whether you walk as the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t ought to walk, having your conver&s;ation in hea|ven, from whence we look for the Sa|viour? In fine, can you reflect, with inward &s;atisfaction, upon the manner in which you have &s;pent &s;o many years; or at lea&s;t &s;ome of the la&s;t of them? and can you look forward into that world, to which you are &s;o near, with comfort, with holy hope, and a joyful expecta|tion

under the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t of the three general divi|&s;ions of the &s;ubject, &s;poken of when we enter'd upon it.</P>
<P>I HAVE, in &s;even other di&s;cour&s;es, &s;hown at large, and by a con&s;iderable variety of arguments, the va&s;t importance of <HI>making ha&s;te</HI> to keep God's command|ments, and the extreme folly and danger of delaying. This is what was propo&s;ed under the &s;econd general head of di&s;cour&s;e. But in&s;tead of repeating any of the&s;e ar|guments here, I &s;hall now proceed to the third general divi&s;ion of the &s;ubject, formerly mentioned: which was,</P>
<P><HI>THIRDLY,</HI> to &s;how the rea&s;onable|ne&s;s of <HI>thinking on our ways,</HI> together with the nece&s;&s;ity, and the conducivene&s;s hereof, to a reformation of them. "I thought on my ways," &s;ays the p&s;almi&s;t, "and turned my feet unto thy te&s;timo|nies: I made ha&s;te," &amp;c. plainly intima|ting, that &s;ober reflection on our conduct, or behaviour, is the fir&s;t, and a nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep, in order to a thorough reformation thereof; and living a life of obedience to God's commandments. Con&s;idering of our ways undoubtedly becomes us as we are rea&s;onable creatures, under the moral government of God, and proba|tioners
<PB N="295" REF="008667_0300_102f7517651243d0">
for happine&s;s in a future &s;tate: Principles which are here taken for gran|ted, as at lea&s;t generally, if not univer|&s;ally believed among&s;t us. And &s;uch con&s;ideration, or reflexion, is not only rea&s;onable in it&s;elf, but, as was intimated above, &s;eems to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order to our turning our feet unto God's te&s;timonies, after we have un|happily gone a&s;tray from them. For how can we reform what is ami&s;s in our tempers, or practices, without fir&s;t re|flecting, what it is that is &s;o, or wherein our ways need reforming? And as this is a nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep in order to amend|ment, &s;o it is al&s;o naturally and plainly conducive thereto. There is ju&s;t ground to hope, that when people are brought to a &s;erious con&s;ideration of their ways, they will, by God's grace and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, actually reform them; or, in the lan|guage of the text, turn their feet unto his te&s;timonies: yea, there is rea&s;on to hope, that they will make ha&s;te, and not delay to do it. Delay in this matter &s;eems to be chiefly owing to incon&s;ideration. We can hardly &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible for a wick|ed man, who con&s;iders his ways, and the con&s;equences of them as he ought to do, to continue any longer in his vicious cour&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="008667_0301_102f751d43693ec8">FROM what has now been &s;ugge&s;ted, you may perceive that this third gene|ral head of di&s;cour&s;e, compri&s;es in it the following particulars, under which it will accordingly be con&s;idered: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>THE rea&s;onablene&s;s of thinking on our ways, as we are rational and moral creatures:</P>
<P>THE indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity hereof, in order to a thorough reformation of them:</P>

<P>THE natural conducivene&s;s hereof to &s;uch amendment; or the ground there is to hope, that tho&s;e who duly reflect on their ways, will, in con&s;equence hereof, make ha&s;te to keep God's com|mandments.</P>
<P>IT is propo&s;ed, by the will of God, to handle the&s;e three particulars in the &s;ame number of di&s;cour&s;es, as di&s;tinctly as may well be. I &s;ay, as di&s;tinctly as may well be; becau&s;e they will in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, almo&s;t unavoidably run into each other in &s;ome re&s;pects. There is a natural and clo&s;e connexion between them, &s;o that it will be hardly po&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve them intirely di&s;tinct thro'out; nor will this be &s;tudiou&s;ly endeavoured. However, it is hoped, there will not be m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ny needle&s;s repetitions of the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="008667_0302_102f7558f3152dd0">To return then: The bu&s;ine&s;s of this di&s;cour&s;e, is to &s;hew the rea&s;onablene&s;s of thinking on our ways, as we are rea|&s;onable and moral creatures, in a &s;tate of probation. For I will not &s;u&s;pect any of my auditors to be &s;o degenerate, or in|fatuated to &s;uch a degree, as to doubt whether man has, or has not, in this re|&s;pect, any "preheminence above a bea&s;t," tho' it &s;eems &s;ome of our pretended &s;ages, both ancient and modern, have made this a que&s;tion, or rather confidently a&s;&s;umed and defended the negative; and even gloried in degrading them&s;elves into the rank of brutes. It is doubtle&s;s a &s;otti&s;h impiety to
<Q>change the glory of the in|corruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man</Q>;
and much more &s;o, to
<Q>birds, and fourfooted bea&s;ts, and creeping things.</Q>
It is a degree of the &s;ame impious folly, for men to de|grade them&s;elves, even in &s;peculation, into brutes;
<Q>for in the image of God made he man</Q>: And it is at lea&s;t pro|bable, that none ever did this in &s;pecu|lation, till they had fir&s;t done it in prac|tice, and for that rea&s;on.</P>
<P>YOU are &s;en&s;ible that the author of our being has made us rational, moral creatures; not "like the hor&s;e and mule which have no under&s;tanding";
<PB N="298" REF="008667_0303_102fb0f76cf9a048">
and therefore, that we ought not to make our&s;elves like them, by bani&s;hing thought and reflexion, and &s;inking into a &s;tate of brutal in&s;en&s;ibility. Tho' con|&s;ideration, or reflexion, is not the chief, ultimate bu&s;ine&s;s of man; yet it ought plainly to be one principal part of his employment; and it is the fir&s;t in order, as it is by this that we are to regulate all our conduct in other re&s;pects. Surely the faculty of rea&s;on, comprehending memory, reflexion and fore-ca&s;t, or the ability of di&s;cerning before-hand certain effects in their cau&s;es, was given us for &s;ome end by our creator. It was not given us to lie dormant, and unemploy|ed; but to be con&s;tantly exerci&s;ed in &s;ome way or other.</P>
<P>NOR indeed is it po&s;&s;ible for the hu|man mind to remain quite idle and inac|tive, for any con&s;iderable time together. It is in its nature active and &s;tirring: It will unavoidably be employed, almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly, in thinking on one thing or another. For altho' it has, in a great mea&s;ure, the choice of the objects, or the &s;ubjects, on which it will employ it|&s;elf, wherein its freedom partly con&s;i&s;ts; yet it &s;eems not to be at liberty, whether it will think and reflect at all or not. &mdash; While a man is awake, he will always
<PB N="299" REF="008667_0304_102fb0f8f4786b38">
employ his thoughts on &s;ome &s;ubject or other; yea, he does this &s;ometimes even in &s;leep; as in dreams. So thoughtful, &s;o contemplative a creature is man by nature, if not again&s;t, yet without his will! All men do not think and reflect upon the &s;ame matters; and many, alas! do not think &s;oberly and properly, either upon them&s;elves, or any thing el&s;e,
<Q>as they ought to think.</Q>
But you ob|&s;erve none, who&s;e thoughts are not, &s;ome way or other, actually employed. Even the <HI>fool,</HI> who in the language of a wit, "whi&s;tles for want of thought," &s;till thinks upon his whi&s;tling at lea&s;t; and upon &s;ome of the objects around him; tho', to be &s;ure, not wi&s;ely. The fool thinks, tho' it be only fooli&s;hly; and the madman, tho' it be only madly. It is probable that all men think and reflect nearly with the &s;ame con&s;tancy, tho' up|on different objects, with different de|grees of inten&s;ene&s;s; &s;ome more proper|ly, others le&s;s; &s;ome wi&s;ely, and others fooli&s;hly. The grand difference between wi&s;e men and fools, or madmen, &s;eems not to lie in this, that the former think and reflect more con&s;tantly and uninter|ruptedly than the latter, but only more ju&s;tly, or to better purpo&s;e. For "vain thoughts will &s;till lodge within us," if
<PB N="300" REF="008667_0305_102fb0fa7b3a9ce8">
wi&s;e ones do not: the very nature of man, and his condition in this world, being &s;uch, that he cannot ordinarily but employ his thoughts on &s;ome thing or other. He mu&s;t needs think, con&s;ider, and reflect, tho' it be only upon trifles, on things of no importance to him&s;elf or o|thers, and even upon them in a fooli&s;h, ab&s;urd manner.</P>
<P>BEING therefore endow'd with this di&s;tingui&s;hing faculty, certainly we ought to exerci&s;e and employ it upon things worthy of it, and in the be&s;t manner po&s;|&s;ible. We &s;hould think chiefly on things that are of importance to us. Tho' we &s;peak of mankind in general as rea&s;ona|ble creatures; yet &s;urely, all men do not exerci&s;e their rational faculties in a way equally rea&s;onable, equally becoming &s;uch creatures. It is an abu&s;e and pro&s;|titution of our rea&s;on, to employ it only, or chiefly, upon trifles; e&s;pecially while there are &s;o many things, worthy to em|ploy it, and take up our attention. It is our indi&s;pen&s;ible duty, as creatures who have received &s;o noble a faculty from God, to exerci&s;e it chiefly upon things of weight and moment; things wherein his honor, and our own good are concerned. If we do not thus em|ploy it, we had as good, perhaps better,
<PB N="301" REF="008667_0306_102fb0fdad287878">
been wholly de&s;titute of rea&s;on. It is rather a di&s;grace to us, than any honor, while we employ it in an unworthy manner; and not only &s;hame, but guilt and mi&s;ery, mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of &s;uch an abu&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is evident then, that we are not on|ly made for thought and con&s;ideration in general; but al&s;o that we ought to chu&s;e fit and worthy objects on which to employ our rational faculties; &s;ince otherwi&s;e we can hardly de&s;erve a better title than that of fools, or madmen. And what is there, on which it more concerns us to think, than on <HI>our own ways,</HI> as we are moral and accountable creatures? I &s;ay, as we are moral and accountable creatures: For to think on our ways in the &s;criptural and theological &s;en&s;e, is not merely to reflect on the actions which we have heretofore done, or to con&s;ider the cour&s;e of life which we lead at pre&s;ent. This does not, of it&s;elf, come up to the full &s;en&s;e of the P&s;almi&s;t in the text. To think on our ways in the re|ligious &s;en&s;e, is to con&s;ider them with re|lation to God and his will, to the rule of our duty, and to a future &s;tate; or as we are the &s;ubjects of God's moral govern|ment, who are hereafter to be rewarded or puni&s;hed by him, according to the
<PB N="302" REF="008667_0307_102fb1031fbf4220">
"things done in the body." To think &s;eriou&s;ly on our behaviour, and review it in this point of light, in order to know how the ca&s;e &s;tands between God and our &s;ouls; whether we are in the way that leadeth to life, or in the broader path that leadeth to death and de&s;tructi|on; this, I &s;ay, is to think on our ways in the &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture. And this being explained, certainly no man who believes the holy &s;criptures; yea, no man who believes the moral character and government of God, and a future &s;tate of retribution, can doubt but that he ought thus to think on his ways.</P>
<P>HAS God made us capable of virtue and religion, and of rendering him a rea&s;onable &s;ervice; and &s;hall we never con&s;ider, whether our conduct is &s;uch as becomes creatures thus di&s;tingui&s;hed? Has he written his law upon our hearts, and our con&s;ciences; and &s;hall we never inquire, whether we have conformed our&s;elves thereto, or deviated from it in our behaviour? Has he given us a reve|lation of his will from heaven, by pro|phets and apo&s;tles, and his own Son; and &s;hall we not con&s;ider, whether we have yielded obedience thereto, or trampled on his authority? Has he gra|ciou&s;ly promi&s;ed eternal life and happi|ne&s;s
<PB N="303" REF="008667_0308_102fb104a75f9318">
to us on certain conditions; and &s;hall we never think it worth while to inquire, whether we have complied with them or not? Has he al&s;o threat|ned to puni&s;h with an everla&s;ting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+&s;truction, tho&s;e that obey not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> but obey unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; and &s;hall we not be inqui&s;itive, whether we are lia|ble to this cur&s;e or not? Are the&s;e &s;uch trivial matters, as not to claim our thoughts and attention? And are the common bu&s;ine&s;s and amu&s;ements of life, of &s;o much importance to us, as to ju&s;tify our giving our minds wholly, or chiefly, to them? No man can he&s;itate, or be at any lo&s;s, for the true and proper an&s;wer to the&s;e &s;everal demands; his con&s;cience will &s;peak, tho' his lips are &s;ilent. You cannot but know, that if you neglect to think on your ways, whatever el&s;e you may employ your thoughts on, you are chargeable with a great and fundamental omi&s;&s;ion; and act a part wholly unworthy of creatures, who claim the title of rational.</P>
<P>THE grand concern of mankind is, to act with propriety as the &s;ubjects of God's moral government. Upon this our pre|&s;ent and future intere&s;t depends. And whether we act &s;uch a part or not, can|not be known by us with out thinking
<PB N="304" REF="008667_0309_102fb1064e240a78">
on our ways; and examining them by the rule which God has given us to walk by. Without this we cannot tell, whe|ther we keep the commandments of God, or live in di&s;obedience to them; whether we are the objects of his favour, or of his wrath; whether we are heirs of the king|dom of heaven, or of death and perdition. And can we content our&s;elves in &s;uch an ignorance of our &s;tate and condition? What inquiry is there that &s;o nearly con|cerns us as this, whether we have hear|kened to the voice of the Son of God, &s;o as to comply with the terms of the go&s;|pel; and con&s;equently, whether we are &s;uch per&s;ons as he will approve in the day of judgment? Or whether we are &s;uch workers of iniquity, to whom he will &s;ay,
<Q>Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire prepared for the devil and his angels?</Q>
If we think at all, we mu&s;t acknowledge it to be both our duty and intere&s;t, thus to examine our&s;elves and our conduct.</P>
<P>IT is the duty and intere&s;t of all men in general, both good and bad, thus to think on their ways: And indeed, as was ju&s;t now intimated, no one can tell, which of the&s;e characters belongs to him, without fir&s;t making the inquiry, by comparing his ways and practices with
<PB N="305" REF="008667_0310_102fb1098911de70">
the rule of his duty, the word of God. So that this examination is not of le&s;s im|portance to us, than it is to know, whe|ther we are the &s;ons of God, and heirs of eternal life, or children of wrath, ex|po&s;ed to eternal de&s;truction; to one or other of which cla&s;&s;es of men, we all be|long, whether we con&s;ider it or not.</P>
<P>IF we are good men, there will pro|bably be at lea&s;t two happy effects of maturely thinking on our ways: One is, the &s;atisfying our&s;elves upon &s;olid and rational grounds, that we are indeed the &s;ervants of God and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and heirs of the promi&s;es; which will not only mini&s;ter great peace and comfort to our minds, but al&s;o excite us to run, with more diligence and delight, the race &s;et before us. The other is, that we &s;hall di&s;cover our pa&s;t defects, and errors, and &s;o be naturally led to correct them. So that, however good we are, we &s;hall doubtle&s;s be both the happier and the better, for carefully reviewing our pa&s;t lives. But it is, if po&s;&s;ible, of &s;till more importance for wicked men to think on their ways; becau&s;e this is one nece&s;&s;ary and probable means, under the influence of the Spirit of God, of con|vincing them of their &s;in and danger; without which, they neither will, nor
<PB N="306" REF="008667_0311_102fb10f59690140">
can, fly for refuge to lay hold of the hope &s;et before them, and &s;o e&s;cape the wrath to come.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t not be omitted here, that in this examination of our&s;elves, we &s;hould u&s;e the utmo&s;t caution and impartiality. A &s;light, &s;uperficial and partial one, may po&s;&s;ibly be of more fatal con&s;equence than none at all, by leading us to form a wrong judgment concerning our&s;elves, or confirming us therein. There is a certain pride, and &s;elf-partiality, too na|tural to mankind, which makes them reluct at &s;eeing the wor&s;t of them&s;elves; which prejudices them in their own &s;a|vour; and often makes them think much better of them&s;elves than they can do with rea&s;on. Of this we &s;hould be aware, and carefully guard again&s;t it. We &s;hould not endeavour to le&s;&s;en the number of our &s;ins, or to extenuate our faults. We &s;hould con&s;ider how "ex|ceeding broad the commandment" is; how numerous its branches, both nega|tive and po&s;itive. We &s;hould reflect, not only on our &s;ins of commi&s;&s;ion, but of omi&s;&s;ion; both what we have done, that ought not to have been done; and what we have left undone, that ought to have been done, and how often. We &s;hould reflect, as much as may be, upon all the

His childhood is all vanity; his youth is employed in thinking on, and enjoying, his &s;inful plea&s;ures. The attaining of worldly honours chiefly employ his riper years.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM XI.</NOTE>IN the la&s;t preceeding di&s;cour&s;e, the rea&s;onablene&s;s of thinking on our ways, was &s;hown from a con&s;idera|ration of tho&s;e intellectual and moral powers, with which the author of our nature has endowed us; and whereby we are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the brutal part of the creation; "the hor&s;e and mule, which have no under&s;tanding."</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="008667_0322_102fb12f51252518">THE propo&s;ed bu&s;ine&s;s of the en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e, is, To &s;how the indi&s;pen&s;ible <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of thinking on our ways, in or|der to a thorough reformation of them; and as what is, in the nature of things previous to the turning our feet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> God's te&s;timonies. This is as nece&s;&s;ary as it is for the mariner, whom winds, &s;torms and currents have long driven, he knows not whither, to take an <HI>ob&s;er|vation,</HI> in order to his finding his port: He mu&s;t know whereabouts he is in the ocean, before he can &s;teer his cour&s;e a|right, unle&s;s he does it by chance. In like manner it is nece&s;&s;ary, that men &s;hould &s;ee whither they have wandered out of the path of life, in order to their returning to it again: Nor is there even a po&s;&s;ibility of their going right by <HI>chance,</HI> in the latter ca&s;e, as there is in the for|mer.</P>
<P>BUT, for the further illu&s;tration of the point before us, it is to be ob&s;erved, that as true religion is founded in rea&s;on, it mu&s;t needs be the re&s;ult of thought, re|flexion, and deliberate choice; it can never be the effect of a blind, undirected &s;ally of the will. You are &s;en&s;ible, it is by means of our rea&s;on, or the faculties of under&s;tanding and reflexion, that we be|come capable &s;ubjects of virtue and re|ligion.
<PB N="318" REF="008667_0323_102fb135a68abad0">
For were we de&s;titute of the&s;e, 'tis manife&s;t we &s;hould be no more capa|ble of religion than the brute creatures. Without them, we could know nothing of God, of his will, or of duty; nothing of what we are to believe as truth, or to practi&s;e as moral beings; we could nei|ther hope nor fear any thing hereafter. And upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, it would be altogether as proper to preach the go&s;pel of the kingdom to bea&s;ts, birds and fi&s;h, as &s;ome of the eminent <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> &s;aints are &s;aid to have done in their <HI>catholick</HI> zeal, as to preach it to mankind. It will rea|dily be allowed then, that the&s;e intellec|tual faculties are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order to our being in any degree religi|ous; and that no creature, being de&s;ti|tute of them, can, in the nature of the thing, be a &s;ubject of piety and virtue.</P>
<P>BUT it is not merely the <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing</HI> of the&s;e faculties, that is requi&s;ite in order to the practice of religion; the <HI>exerci&s;e,</HI> or <HI>u&s;e</HI> of them, is equally nece&s;&s;ary&punc; If it were po&s;&s;ible for us to be religious, pious and virtuous, without actually employing and exerting the&s;e faculties, I &s;ee not why we might not be &s;o, even tho' we were not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them at all. They are nece&s;&s;ary, no further than the u&s;e of them is nece&s;&s;ary; and only be|cau&s;e
<PB N="319" REF="008667_0324_102fb1372c6cc998">
it is. Whatever we are capable of, without the actual u&s;e of any particular powers or faculties, we are equally ca|pable of, without tho&s;e powers them|&s;elves: for not being exerci&s;ed, or &s;o long as they lie dormant, they are as nothing; and can have no effect. That man who never thinks of God&punc; and of his ways, of his duty, and of the obligations which he is under, is doubtle&s;s as void of reli|gion, while thus thoughtle&s;s, as the bea&s;ts of the field. All the difference is, that he has a remote capacity for religion and virtue, whereas the brutes are &s;uppo|&s;ed to have none: But at pre&s;ent, he is not more pious or virtuous than they.</P>
<P>IT is indeed very evident, that reli|gion con&s;i&s;ts in the proper exerci&s;e, or due application, of tho&s;e faculties and powers, whereby we are originally ren|der'd the capable &s;ubjects thereof. For in what does religion con&s;i&s;t? What is it that denominates a man to be truly pi|ous and virtuous? Doubtle&s;s religion con&s;i&s;ts in knowing God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t; in under&s;tanding his word and will; in believing what God has revealed; in loving him above all things; and an ha|bitual care to keep his commandments, in hope of eternal life; not as of merit in us, but as the "gift of God thro'
<PB N="320" REF="008667_0325_102fb138b287da20">
Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord." This is a &s;um|mary account of the nature of religion. From whence it plainly appears, as was &s;aid before, that it con&s;i&s;ts in the actual exerci&s;e, and right application, of our intellectual and moral powers. For what are knowledge, faith, reflexion, choice, hope, and obedience, but the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e various powers? And hence it is evident, that without think|ing on God and our ways, it is impo&s;&s;i|ble for us to turn our feet unto his te&s;ti|monies, or to keep his commandments.</P>
<P>BUT, from the&s;e general remarks, let us proceed to &s;ome more particular ones. And here it is to be ob&s;erved, that with|out thinking on our ways, it is impo&s;&s;i|ble we &s;hould know, in what re&s;pects they are evil, and need reforming. The expre&s;&s;ion in the text, of turning our feet unto God's te&s;timonies, pre&s;uppo&s;es that we have in &s;ome degree at lea&s;t, and in certain in&s;tances, gone a&s;tray from them. It implies, that we have, in &s;ome particulars, walked contrary to God's commandments, and violated our duty. This, I &s;ay, is plainly implied, or pre&s;uppo&s;ed, in that manner of ex|pre&s;&s;ion. Now it may be a&s;ked, how it is po&s;&s;ible for a man, who does not re|flect &s;eriou&s;ly on his ways, to know
<PB N="321" REF="008667_0326_102fb13a37e207c0">
which of them are evil; what duties he has neglected, and what &s;ins he is charge|able with? And if he is ignorant as to the&s;e points, is it not impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould for&s;ake his &s;ins, and practi&s;e his duty for the time to come? Doubtle&s;s this is impo&s;&s;ible. Tho' a man were &s;en&s;ible in general, that his ways had been evil, and were de&s;irous to reform them; yet it is obvious, that without particularly reflecting upon them, and comparing them with the rule of duty, &s;o as to &s;ee in what re&s;pects they have been evil, and wherein they ought to be amended, he cannot reform them, or turn his feet unto God's te&s;timonies. You &s;ee then, from this con&s;ideration only, the nece&s;&s;ity of thinking on our ways; and that without it, no man can po&s;&s;ibly for&s;ake his former &s;ins, become a true &s;ervant of God, and a di&s;ciple of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>MOREOVER: Thinking on our ways, &s;o as to be deeply &s;en&s;ible of the evil of them, is nece&s;&s;ary in order to beget in us that humility, and godly &s;orrow, which are e&s;&s;ential ingredients of true repentance; that repentance, which is the principle, and the beginning of a new and &s;piritual life. You know that evangelical repentance implies in it, &s;elf-condemnation,
<PB N="322" REF="008667_0327_102fb141cb94eb88">
&s;hame, grief, and humi|liation before God; hearty &s;orrow for our &s;ins, that we have acted &s;o fooli&s;hly and ungratefully; and thereby render'd our&s;elves the objects of God's righteous di&s;plea&s;ure. Without this, there is no true repentance; nor can there be any thorough reformation. But is it not im|po&s;&s;ible in the nature of the thing, that without &s;eriou&s;ly thinking on our ways, we &s;hould thus condemn our&s;elves for them, be thus a&s;hamed, grieved and hum|bled before God? What foundation is there for &s;elf-condemnation, grief or &s;hame, antecedently to our reflecting, wherein we have done ami&s;s? Can tho&s;e things, or actions, which are not even tho't of by us, or if at all tho't of, yet not reflected on as evil, and contrary to the law of God, be to us the ground of humiliation and godly &s;orrow? Cer|tainly they cannot. You cannot be grieved, and &s;orry for your &s;ins, with|out thinking of them; without remem|bring that you have committed them, and &s;eeing your pa&s;t errors. You can|not be a&s;hamed of the part you have acted, till you are convinced, by reflec|tion, that it is a ba&s;e and unworthy one. You cannot bewail your &s;ins before God, till you are deeply &s;en&s;ible of them.
<PB N="323" REF="008667_0328_102fb143a9481d80">
This is obvious: So that if &s;elf-condem|nation, &s;hame, and godly &s;orrow, be e&s;&s;ential to true repentance, and nece&s;&s;a|ry in order to our turning our feet unto God's te&s;timonies; thinking on our ways is plainly nece&s;&s;ary al&s;o to the &s;ame end: For without thinking on them, a man cannot thus condemn him&s;elf, be a&s;hamed and grieved, on account of what he has done.</P>
<P>WE know not what we ought to be &s;orry for, or what rejoiced at, with re|ference to our pa&s;t behaviour, without maturely reflecting upon it. Why &s;hould we bewail one part of our conduct, ra|ther than any other, till, by &s;eriou&s;ly &s;canning and examining it, we have learned wherein it has been wrong, or criminal? If we would exerci&s;e that humility which becomes us; if we would condemn our&s;elves to the degree we ought to do; if we would aba&s;e our &s;elves before God, in a manner becoming &s;uch &s;inful creatures; to reflect in general, that we are &s;inners, is not &s;ufficient. We &s;hould con&s;ider, how numerous and great our offences have been; how frequently we have broken God's commandments; and with what aggravating circum&s;tances our &s;ins have been attended. Slight and &s;uperficial reflection, will produce only
<PB N="324" REF="008667_0329_102fb1452fd45ab0">
a &s;light, &s;uperficial, and ineffectual re|pentance. It is nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould think particularly and inten&s;ely on our ways, in order to beget in us a deep &s;or|row on account of them; and that, our hearts being truly broken and contrite, we may be excited in earne&s;t, and with|out delay, to fly for refuge, and lay hold on the hope &s;et before us.</P>
<P>NO one will &s;uppo&s;e my meaning to be, that we cannot be truly penitent for our &s;ins, and turn our feet unto God's te&s;timonies, unle&s;s we &s;o think of our ways, as actually to recollect every par|ticular in&s;tance, wherein we have devi|ated from the rule of duty, together with every minute circum&s;tance, by which our guilt has been enhanced, thro' the cour&s;e of our lives. Were this indi&s;pen|&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, there would be no tho|roughly penitent, and reformed &s;inner in the world. For who can, in this &s;en&s;e, "under&s;tand his errors?" No man can remember all his &s;inful deeds without ex|ception, however de&s;irous to call them to mind, for his humiliation. But it is both practicable and nece&s;&s;ary, to be much more particular and circum&s;tan|tial in reviewing our pa&s;t lives, and re|collecting our mi&s;carriages, than many per&s;ons &s;eem to imagine.

in general, that we have done ami&s;s, to be &s;ure, is not all that is po&s;&s;ible, or all that is requi&s;ite. We &s;hall never abhor our&s;elves, or "repent in du&s;t and a&s;hes," till we have a more particular view of our pa&s;t &s;ins, and &s;ee our&s;elves in our pro|per colours. It is nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould &s;ee our &s;ins, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, as God &s;ees them, or in the &s;ame odious light, in or|der to hating them as he hates them; and "breaking them off by righteou&s;ne&s;s."</P>
<P>THINKING on our ways, is plainly nece&s;&s;ary in order to our having the pro|per <HI>motives</HI> and <HI>inducements</HI> to amend our ways, pre&s;ent to our minds, &s;o as effec|tually to influence our practice. It is, in the nature of things, impo&s;&s;ible for us to turn our feet unto God's te&s;timonies, and to keep his commandments for the future, without &s;eeing, or perceiving, the motives, proper to induce us thereto. Arguments, or motives, that are not per|ceived by us, are to us, as nothing; and can have no effect upon us. The prin|cipal motives, by which &s;inners are wrought upon, and induced to for&s;ake their evil ways, whenever they do &s;o, are the&s;e which follow:&mdash; The apparent unrea&s;onablene&s;s and ba&s;ene&s;s of their pa&s;t behaviour; an apprehen&s;ion of God's di&s;plea&s;ure; a fear of future puni&s;hment;
<PB N="326" REF="008667_0331_102fb14ead3d2188">
together with the hopes of pardon and eternal life thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in con&s;e|quence of for&s;aking their evil ways. The&s;e are the principal, and mo&s;t u&s;ual, if not the only motives, by which wick|ed men are induced to turn from their &s;ins to God. None of which can have any influence upon us, or even be per|ceived as motives, inciting us to &s;uch a change of life and behaviour, unle&s;s we &s;eriou&s;ly think on our ways.</P>
<P>FOR, as to the former of them: It is impo&s;&s;ible the unrea&s;onablene&s;s and ba&s;e|ne&s;s of &s;inning again&s;t God, &s;hould be any inducement to us to cea&s;e from evil, unle&s;s that unrea&s;onablene&s;s and ba&s;e|ne&s;s is perceived by us; and it cannot be perceived, till we think on our ways. However ba&s;e or di&s;ingenuous a man's behaviour has been, yet without reflec|ting upon it, he cannot perceive it; and, con&s;equently, this will be no motive with him to alter his cour&s;e and manner of life.</P>
<P>AGAIN: However obnoxious a man may be to God's righteous di&s;plea&s;ure, on account of his pa&s;t &s;ins; yet he can have no &s;en&s;e, no apprehen&s;ion of that di&s;plea&s;ure, till he con&s;iders his ways: And con&s;equently, he cannot be indu|ced hereby to reform his ways. This
<PB N="327" REF="008667_0332_102fb1503322b6a8">
will, as to him, be no motive at all, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, how efficacious an one &s;oever it might be, if by means of reflecting on his &s;ins, he had a proper &s;en&s;e of their demerit.</P>
<P>NOR can the terrible puni&s;hment, which God has threatned to inflict on the impenitent workers of iniquity, have any influence, by way of motive, upon the mind and practice of that man, who does not view him&s;elf in the light of a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, and &s;ee, that without repentance and reformation, he mu&s;t finally incur this puni&s;hment. He can|not fear future evil, at lea&s;t, not rea&s;o|nably, but in proportion to the &s;en&s;e which he has of his evil de&s;erts, on ac|count of his pa&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>LASTLY here, How can the hopes of obtaining pardon and eternal life, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, induce that man to for&s;ake his &s;ins, and to work righteou&s;ne&s;s, who is &s;o far from being burthened, and heavy laden with a &s;en&s;e of his guilt, that he does not even think of his pa&s;t &s;ins, or his need of a pardon? To tho&s;e who are &s;en&s;ible of their demerits, and their need of forgivene&s;s, the hopes thereof will be a powerful motive; but to others it will be none at all.
<Q>The whole need not the phy&s;ician, but they that are &s;ick</Q>.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="008667_0333_102fb152419f9a88">FROM the&s;e hints it is evident, that none of the great motives to repent, and to live a new life, can have any influence upon a man, who does not think on his ways; they cannot be felt and perceiv|ed by carele&s;s, thoughtle&s;s &s;inners. It is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in order to their having any weight or influence as mo|tives, that the mind be duly awakened; or that a man has a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the evil of his ways, which, certainly, he cannot have without thinking &s;eriou&s;ly on them.</P>
<P>NOW is it po&s;&s;ible, in the nature of things, that &s;inners &s;hould truly repent, and turn their feet unto God's te&s;timonies, without any motives thereto; or which is the &s;ame thing in effect, without per|ceiving tho&s;e which there are? This is plainly impo&s;&s;ible; an ab&s;urd &s;uppo&s;ition. No man does, or can, for&s;ake his &s;ins, and work righteou&s;ne&s;s, without know|ing why, or wherefore he does &s;o; with|out having certain inducements thereto in his own mind; and &s;uch as are pro|per to influence it in this manner. And it is only by means of &s;erious reflexion, that the&s;e motives come to be perceived, &s;o as to operate, and produce their pro|per effect.</P>
<P>I HAVE now almo&s;t fini&s;hed what was propo&s;ed as the main bu&s;ine&s;s of
<PB N="329" REF="008667_0334_102fb15864cf4b48">
this di&s;cour&s;e; which was, to &s;how the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of thinking on our ways, in order to reforming them, and keeping God's commandments for the time to come. To this end it has been &s;hown in general, that without exerci|&s;ing our intellectual and moral powers, in thinking on God, our duty and our ways, we cannot be the &s;ubjects of religi|on and virtue: That without reviewing our pa&s;t lives, we cannot even know, wherein our ways need reforming, or whether they at all need it, or not: That reflecting on our ways, is nece&s;&s;ary to beget in us that humility, and godly &s;or|row, which are e&s;&s;ential ingredients in true repentance: And la&s;tly, it has been &s;hown, That the great motives to reform and amend our ways, can have no influ|ence upon our minds, nor even be per|ceived by us, unle&s;s we fir&s;t think on our ways, and are duly &s;en&s;ible of our guilt and danger, while we continue to break God's commandments. From all which con&s;iderations laid together, I &s;uppo&s;e it &s;ufficiently appears to be an impo&s;&s;ibili|ty for any &s;inner to turn his feet unto God's te&s;timonies, without &s;eriou&s;ly re|flecting on his ways in the manner before explained.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="008667_0335_102fb159e8f8c500">BUT there is one objection, which may be thought to lie again&s;t this man|ner of rea&s;oning, concerning the nece&s;|&s;ity of thinking on our ways: And this mu&s;t be obviated before we di&s;mi&s;s this branch of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>WE all &s;uppo&s;e, at lea&s;t it is now taken for granted, that it is the work of the Spirit of God effectually to renew and con|vert &s;inners, or to turn them from the error of their ways to the wi&s;dom of the ju&s;t. And may not God, by the influences of his Spirit, thus change the hearts of men immediately, whether they think on their ways or not? Cannot God work without means? Or can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that man's co-operation is nece&s;&s;ary in order to his being created anew unto good works, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, any more than to his fir&s;t creation? How can thinking on our ways be &s;aid to be nece&s;&s;ary to this end, if it either mu&s;t, or may be, &s;up|po&s;ed po&s;&s;ible for God to change a man's heart, and convert him, without think|ing on them.</P>
<P>NOW there are &s;everal things to be ob|&s;erved with reverence to this objection.</P>
<P>ALTHO' the influences of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of God, are undoubtedly nece&s;&s;ary in order to the effectual conver&s;ion of &s;in|ners; and altho' God <HI>can</HI> do all things,

which do not involve a contradiction; yet he may have e&s;tabli&s;hed, and re|vealed to us, &s;uch a method of operating, even in the kingdom of grace, that we may mode&s;tly &s;ay, in a qualified &s;en&s;e, that &s;uch or &s;uch a thing is impo&s;&s;ible; meaning thereby, that it would be incon&s;i&s;tent with, or contrary to, what he has been plea&s;ed to reveal as the rule or method of his dealings with the &s;in|ful children of men; and not, that the thing it&s;elf exceeds the power of God, or involves a contradiction in its own na|ture. Many things are naturally po&s;&s;ible, which yet are apparently incon&s;i&s;tent with what God has revealed, and what we know concerning the manner of his acting; and therefore no one &s;cruples to &s;ay of &s;uch things, that they are impo&s;&s;i|ble; that they cannot be done, or come to pa&s;s. Now in this qualified &s;en&s;e at lea&s;t, we may, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ay without offence, or pre&s;umption, that it is impo&s;|&s;ible for a man to be converted from &s;in to righteou&s;ne&s;s, without fir&s;t thinking on his ways. For thro'out the holy &s;crip|tures, &s;inners thinking on their ways, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be previous to their conver|&s;ion from the error of them. God treats with &s;inful men therein, as rational crea|tures: He conde&s;cends to rea&s;on with
<PB N="332" REF="008667_0337_102fb15e7a075ca8">
them him&s;elf, concerning the evil of their ways, admoni&s;hing them to reflect on them, and to for&s;ake them, le&s;t ini|quity &s;hould be their ruin. This is of|ten the manner of his addre&s;s to them. &mdash;
<Q>Come now, and let us rea&s;on toge|ther, &s;aith the Lord.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>Are not my ways equal; are not your ways une|qual?</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>What more could have been done in my vineyard, that I have not done in it?</Q>
&mdash;

Such a kind of addre&s;s and expo&s;tulation, is frequently met with, both in the old and new-te&s;tament. And I appeal to every unprejudiced man, whether &s;uch a manner of addre&s;s, does not plainly &s;uppo&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eri|ous reflexion on our ways, as one means of our conver&s;ion; and whether this can be reconciled with the other &s;uppo&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI> that &s;inners are converted by an im|mediate exertion of the divine power on their hearts, before they are per&s;waded to think on their ways, and the con&s;e|quences of them? All the expo&s;tulations, the admonitions, the promi&s;es and threat|nings, of God's word, &s;eem plainly de|&s;igned to awaken &s;inners to &s;erious con|&s;ideration,
<PB N="333" REF="008667_0338_102fb1651a9ff6b8">
and reflexion on their ways, as preparatory to their conver&s;ion, and nece&s;&s;ary to that end; tho' this, to be &s;ure, will not be effectual without the ble&s;&s;ing of God concurring; without whom we can do nothing.</P>
<P>AT fir&s;t view, there may, perhaps, &s;eem to be &s;ome in&s;tances, or examples in &s;cripture, of &s;inners being immediate|ly and in&s;tantaneou&s;ly converted by the power of God, antecedently to their thinking on their ways, and being awa|kened to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their guilt: But, upon mature con&s;ideration, I believe, we &s;hall find no &s;uch examples. The thief upon the cro&s;s may, by &s;ome, be thought one; but there in no &s;ufficient ground for it. It is rather to be &s;uppo&s;|ed, that his condemnation and &s;ufferings were in&s;trumental of awakening in him a &s;en&s;e of his &s;ins, which, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God i&s;&s;ued in his conver&s;ion. That he thought on his ways, judged and condemned him&s;elf, is very evident from his an&s;wer to the guilty and hardened companion of his &s;ufferings, who <HI>railed</HI> on our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. For he rebuked him, &s;aying,
<Q>Do&s;t thou not fear God? &s;eeing thou art in the &s;ame condemna|tion; <HI>and we indeed ju&s;tly</HI>; but this man hath done nothing ami&s;s.</Q>
To &s;ay the
<PB N="334" REF="008667_0339_102fb166a0002380">
lea&s;t, the hi&s;tory gives us no rea&s;on to think, that the penitent thief became a penitent, without being fir&s;t led, by the providence and Spirit of God, to a &s;eri|ous con&s;ideration of his ways; how &s;hort &s;oever the time may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been, between that and his conver&s;ion. Tho', by the way, it is by no means cer|tain, that he had been hardened and thoughtle&s;s till he was actually brought to the cro&s;s, tho' this &s;eems to be gene|rally taken for granted.</P>
<P>AS to the apo&s;tle Paul; tho' there was &s;omething very &s;ingular, and even miraculous, in the manner and circum|&s;tances of his conver&s;ion; yet we have no rea&s;on to think that he was in&s;tanta|neou&s;ly converted, when he was &s;truck down in his journey to Dama&s;cus; I mean, antecedently to his thinking on his ways. There is, on the contrary, great rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that what happened to him at that time, was a means of awakening him, and con|vincing him of his &s;in; and this in order to his conver&s;ion. It is, indeed, evident from his &s;tory in the new te&s;tament, that his turning his feet unto God's te&s;|timonies, was &s;ub&s;equent to, and in con|&s;equence of, his being thus admoni&s;hed to think on his ways; tho' the preci&s;e
<PB N="335" REF="008667_0340_102fb1682516c810">
time of his conver&s;ion, or being born a|gain, cannot be a&s;certained.</P>
<P>BUT what &s;hall we &s;ay of the three thou&s;and, that were added to the church &s;o &s;uddenly on the day of penteco&s;t? We may &s;ay, in the fir&s;t place, that there is no certainty of their having been then converted, in the &s;en&s;e wherein we now u&s;e that term, tho' they were convinced that Je&s;us was <HI>the Chri&s;t,</HI> the anointed of God. And, in the &s;econd place, that upon &s;uppo&s;ition they were thus conver|ted, yet this does not militate in the lea&s;t degree, again&s;t any thing that has been &s;aid concerning the nece&s;&s;ity of thinking on our ways. For the apo&s;tle Peter had been preaching the go&s;pel to them, in a mo&s;t awakening and affecting manner; whereby they were brought to &s;erious reflexion. And it is expre&s;ly &s;aid in the &s;tory, that when they heard him,
<Q>they were pricked in the heart, and &s;aid, Men and brethren, what &s;hall we do?</Q>
Had they not thought on their ways, they would not have been thus "pricked in the heart," which implies a deep &s;en&s;e of their &s;ins: So that nothing can be argued from hence, again&s;t what has been &s;aid in this di&s;cour&s;e, concerning the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;erious con&s;ideration and reflexion.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="008667_0341_102fb16b844c47e0">I BELIEVE there are no in&s;tances of a quick and &s;udden conver&s;ion, recorded in &s;cripture, which bid fairer than tho&s;e mentioned above, to be examples of the conver&s;ion of &s;inners, without thinking on their ways. However, neither that of the thief, that of Saul, nor that of the three thou&s;and, comes up to the point. It &s;eems plain from the &s;everal accounts of them, that all the&s;e per&s;ons did actu|ally think on their ways, as well as Da|vid, before they turned their feet unto God's te&s;timonies; though, perhaps, not &s;o long before. And if any &s;hould think it may be inferred from the&s;e examples, that per&s;ons, in this age of the world, may po&s;&s;ibly be converted almo&s;t in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly, or in a very &s;hort time from their being fir&s;t awakened to a &s;en&s;e of their &s;ins; I will not deny the inference. There may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uch a concur|rence of alarming circum&s;tances, as, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, &s;hall in a moment, as it were, produce a thorough and &s;a|ving change in the heart of a &s;inner, even without a miracle. This may be allow|ed without inconvenience. But there was plainly &s;omething preternatural and miraculous in the circum&s;tances of the conver&s;ion of the thief, of Saul, and of the three thou&s;and. That was the age
<PB N="337" REF="008667_0342_102fb16e9b490be0">
of miracles: And to &s;ay the lea&s;t, there is no rea&s;on to think, that &s;uch quick and &s;udden conver&s;ions have been common, &s;ince miracles have cea&s;ed in the church&punc; This work is u&s;ually, if not always, effected, in the&s;e latter times, in a more gradual way. And it is to rea&s;on fal&s;ely and ab&s;urdly, to argue from tho&s;e extra|ordinary and preternatural conver&s;ions, as &s;ome have done; as if we were to conceive, that other per&s;ons who are con|verted from age to age, are u&s;ually con|verted in as &s;udden and extemporaneous a manner. For this there is no founda|tion; and it may be of bad con&s;equence for people to entertain &s;uch an opinion. But it would be &s;till more ab&s;urd and per|nicious, to argue from tho&s;e examples, that whether &s;inners think on their ways at all, or not, they may be converted by &s;ome &s;udden impul&s;e, or &s;ecret energy, of the Spirit of God.</P>
<P>THIS, if I am not extremely mi&s;taken, is not only a moral, but a natural impo&s;|&s;ibility, implying a plain contradiction. For conver&s;ion, or a turning from &s;in to God, in the nature of it pre&s;uppo&s;es re|pentance, an awakened &s;en&s;e of, and &s;orrow for &s;in. And, as was particular|ly &s;hown above, it is, in the nature of things, impo&s;&s;ible for a man to repent of
<PB N="338" REF="008667_0343_102fb1745401f2c0">
his &s;ins, or to be &s;orry for them, without thinking on his ways. That which is not even the &s;ubject of our thoughts, cannot, &s;urely, be any ground of &s;hame and &s;orrow to us, or be repented of by us. And if it be a contradiction to &s;ay, that a man repents of his &s;ins without thinking on them; it is al&s;o a contradic|tion to &s;ay, that a man may be convert|ed without thinking on his ways; &s;ince, as was ob&s;erved before, conver&s;ion pre|&s;uppo&s;es repentance. And if this involves a contradiction, there is no pre&s;umption in &s;aying, that it is impo&s;&s;ible, even with God him&s;elf; tho' I am by no means fond of making a frequent u&s;e of &s;uch expre&s;|&s;ions; and would never do it at all, but with reverence and awe. It is, on all hands allowed, that even the power of God does not extend to the doing of things impo&s;&s;ible in their own nature, as all tho&s;e are, which involve a contradic|tion. How much &s;oever we a&s;cribe to the Spirit of God, in the conver&s;ion of &s;inners; &s;till it may, and mu&s;t be a&s;&s;ert|ed, that no man is or can be converted, without thinking on his ways, either for a longer or &s;horter time. Nor does God give us his holy Spirit to &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of this, or to render it needle&s;s for us to think on, and repent of our

&s;ins: But on the contrary, to awaken and excite us thereto; to convince us of &s;in, to humble us for it, to make us &s;ee it in its proper colors, to in&s;pire us with an hatred of it, and the love of virtue and holine&s;s. Thus it is, that he con|verteth &s;inners from the error of their ways, to the wi&s;dom of the ju&s;t, by his providence and good Spirit; &s;ometimes, indeed in a le&s;s, and &s;ometimes in a more gradual way; but never without awaken|ing us to &s;erious thought and reflexion; which is a manife&s;t impo&s;&s;ibility and con|tradiction, as before ob&s;erved. And this is &s;ufficient to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; &s;ince from hence appears, the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of thinking on our ways, in order to a thorough reformation thereof, and turn|ing our feet unto God's te&s;timonies.</P>

If wicked men now refu&s;e to con&s;ider their ways, and the things which belong to their peace, there is a day approaching, which will not only awaken, but fill them with terror and amazement; and they will think on their ways when it will be too late to amend them.

For had thinking on our ways no kind of tendency to reform them, it could not be truly and properly &s;aid, to be nece&s;&s;ary in order thereto; this man|ner of expre&s;&s;ion &s;uppo&s;ing it to be a mean to the mentioned end. But it will not be ami&s;s to &s;peak more particu|larly upon this point, as was propo&s;ed under the third and la&s;t general divi&s;ion of the &s;ubject. Accordingly, the main bu&s;ine&s;s of this di&s;cour&s;e will be, to &s;how,</P>
<P>THAT thinking on our ways has a natural tendency to reform them, or lead us to the keeping of God's com|mandments: So that there is great rea|&s;on to hope, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e who do &s;o, in the &s;en&s;e of the text, will, like the P&s;almi&s;t, actually turn their feet unto God's te&s;ti|monies, and walk before him in newne&s;s of life.</P>
<P>THERE &s;eems to be a kind of incon|&s;i&s;tency between &s;erious reflexion, and allowed, habitual di&s;obedience to God's commandments. For 'tis very difficult to conceive, how a man who duly thinks on his ways, and &s;ees the evil and danger of them, can po&s;&s;ibly per&s;evere, notwith&s;tanding, in the violation of God's laws. And the holy &s;criptures, you are &s;en&s;ible&punc; &s;ometimes repre&s;ent it
<PB N="343" REF="008667_0348_102fb1823323e370">
as owing to incon&s;ideration, or a want of due attention, that men go on in their &s;ins. "My people doth not con&s;ider," <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">I&s;a. Ch. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> was the complaint exhibited again&s;t I&s;|rael of old; and this is &s;poken of as the rea&s;on, or cau&s;e, of all their &s;ins and mi&s;|carriages in general. To this it is attri|buted, that they were &s;uch a "&s;inful nation, a people laden with iniquity." In which pa&s;&s;age it is implied, that had they properly con&s;idered of God and their ways, they could not have been &s;uch a &s;inful people. Con&s;ideration will either prevent men from falling into a cour&s;e and habit of &s;in; or, after they are fallen into &s;uch a cour&s;e, be a means of reforming them. And hence it is, that we are &s;o frequently admoni&s;hed in &s;cripture, to think on our ways, what we are about, and to what our doings tend. And in many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, a connexion is plainly implied, between con&s;ideration and amendment; as if the latter of cour&s;e followed the former. Thus the P&s;almi&s;t in the text, "I <HI>thought</HI> on my ways, and <HI>turned,</HI> &amp;c. So it is &s;aid (Ezek. chap. 18.) concerning the wicked man, That "becau&s;e he <HI>con&s;idereth,</HI> and <HI>turneth</HI> away from all his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions &mdash;he &s;hall &s;urely live." It is here im|plied, not only that con&s;ideration is, in
<PB N="344" REF="008667_0349_102fb183ba30aec8">
the natural order of things, antecedent to repentance and amendment, but that it is conducive thereto, as a means: So that when a &s;inner becomes thoughtful and con&s;iderate, he is in a fair and hope|ful way to be reformed. It may natu|rally be expected, that having thought on his ways, he will now cea&s;e to do e|vil, and learn to do well. This is the manife&s;t &s;cope of many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;crip|ture, which it will not be nece&s;&s;ary par|ticularly to refer to.</P>
<P>BUT it will be proper to be a little more di&s;tinct in explaining and proving this &s;uppo&s;ed connexion between think|ing on our ways, and turning our feet unto God's te&s;timonies. And a little at|tention to the point, will, I &s;uppo&s;e, make it &s;ufficiently evident, that there is indeed &s;uch a connexion between the&s;e things.</P>
<P>THE chief, governing principles in human nature, (exclu&s;ive of worldly lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions) are rea&s;on, con&s;cience, gratitude, fear, and hope. Now &s;erious con&s;ideration, or thinking on our ways, as this was explained in a preceeding di&s;cour&s;e, has a direct tendency to a|waken all the&s;e principles into act, and make them operate together to the pro|duction of &s;uch an effect in us, I mean
<PB N="345" REF="008667_0350_102fb186ccd2ce70">
our reformation. While we are thought|le&s;s, they lie dormant in us, or at lea&s;t they are not properly directed. But con&s;ideration awakens and regulates them, in &s;uch a manner, that our a|mendment can hardly fail to be the con|&s;equence thereof.</P>
<P>TO begin with the former of the&s;e principles, REASON. All vice and ir|religion are doubtle&s;s contrary to rea&s;on; piety and virtue agreeable thereto. And if &s;o, when a rea&s;onable creature con&s;i|ders, and this faculty is awakened, it is naturally conducive to pious and virtu|ous practice. Tho&s;e who are thought|le&s;s and incon&s;iderate, do not really know how unrea&s;onable their practices are; and therefore ru&s;h blindly on in &s;in, without check or bridle. But he that thinks on his ways, &s;ees the folly and madne&s;s of vice; and knows how it be|comes him to act. His rea&s;on, which was before inoperative, and a&s;leep, be|ing now rou&s;ed up, will perform its proper function. And one would think it impo&s;&s;ible for a man to act unrea&s;ona|bly in the actual exerci&s;e of rea&s;on, as every one is, while he thinks on his ways in the manner &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>CONSCIENCE and rea&s;on are &s;o near akin to each other, that they can hardly
<PB N="346" REF="008667_0351_102fb18b1d2b1250">
be &s;eparated, tho' they do not &s;ignify exactly the &s;ame thing. Con&s;cience im|plies in it a certain moral &s;en&s;e, or in|ternal feeling, of right and wrong, vir|tue and vice, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e di&s;tinct from mere rea&s;on. This, however, is not al|ways awake; or rather it is generally a&s;leep in vicious men; and &s;ometimes "&s;eared as with an hot iron;" &s;o that very profligate and abandoned &s;inners, are &s;aid to be "pa&s;t feeling." Whenever it is awake, or in exerci&s;e, it is a power|ful principle of action; and will not &s;uf|fer a man to do ami&s;s, without the mo&s;t bitter reproaches. Now it is by means of reflexion, and con&s;ideration, that the con&s;cencies of &s;inners are alarmed, and put upon exerting their proper authority. And whenever they do &s;o, they are pro|ductive of a reformation, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree. A &s;inner, who&s;e con&s;cience is duly awakened by thinking on the evil and danger of his ways, cannot at the &s;ame time, commit iniquity with grea|dine&s;s; but will of cour&s;e be de&s;irous to reform his ways; which de&s;ire is it&s;elf the beginning of a reformation in him. Nor will &s;uch a per&s;on
<Q>turn again to folly,</Q>
unle&s;s his con&s;cience is, by &s;ome means or other lulled to &s;leep again.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="008667_0352_102fb18e2b5f7c30">MOREOVER: Serious con&s;ideration has a natural tendency to awaken our GRATITUDE to God for his goodne&s;s, forbearance and long-&s;uffering, and &s;o to lead us to repentance. Thoughtle&s;s &s;in|ners have no proper conception of the goodne&s;s and mercy of God, daily ex|tended towards them; nor know how ba&s;e and di&s;ingenuous their conduct is with regard to him. But when a man thinks &s;eriou&s;ly on his ways, he will be a&s;hamed, yea even confounded, that he has &s;o abu&s;ed the goodne&s;s of God, and made &s;o ill a return to him for his mer|cies. He will be almo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed, that God has been &s;o patient and kind to one, who has de&s;erved &s;o ill at his hands; and not con&s;umed him in his hot di&s;plea&s;ure. And when a per&s;on is, by reflexion, brought to &s;uch a ju&s;t and ingenuous &s;en&s;e of things, it will naturally lead him to amend his ways. He will be power|ful incited to make &s;ome returns to God, an&s;werable to the obligations he has been laid under; and to devote his future life to the honor and &s;ervice of his divine benefactor. If the la&s;t &s;park of ingenui|ty is not quite extingui&s;hed in us, &s;erious con&s;ideration will not fail to awaken it, and being awakened, it will certainly have &s;ome good effect upon our beha|viour.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="008667_0353_102fb18fb2fb9708">AGAIN: Serious con&s;ideration has a natural tendency to awaken our FEARS, to excite in &s;inners a ju&s;t apprehen&s;ion of the wrath to come, and, thereby, to reform them. Tho&s;e who do not think, do not fear God's di&s;plea&s;ure, how much rea&s;on &s;o ever they may have for it. But when &s;inners reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on their ways, they cannot but &s;ee that they are expo&s;ed to the wrath of God, and know that they mu&s;t finally experience the dreadful effects of it, except they repent, and turn their feet unto his te&s;timonies. Now when a man has a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the mi&s;ery of his condition, in being an ob|ject of God's di&s;plea&s;ure, and &s;ees the danger he is in of being condemned in the judgement of the great day; this will make him anxious to fly from the wrath to come. A ju&s;t fear being thus excited in him, it will be morally impo&s;&s;ible for him to per&s;evere in his vicious cour&s;es. All men dread mi&s;ery; and not only dread, but endeavour to avoid it, when they plainly &s;ee they are in danger. And this principle of fear, will operate at lea&s;t as powerfully in the concernments of religion, when a man really &s;ees, or believes his danger, as it does in tho&s;e of a temporal and worldly nature. So that if a man be a &s;peculative believer of
<PB N="349" REF="008667_0354_102fb192c0098968">
the holy &s;criptures, which is here all a|long taken for granted, he mu&s;t needs be afraid, when he thinks of his &s;ins; and be &s;ollicitous to e&s;cape the perdition threatned.</P>
<P>MOREOVER: Con&s;ideration will &s;erve to awaken the HOPES, as well as the fears of wicked men. A tho'tle&s;s &s;inner is unaffected with the ble&s;&s;ed promi&s;es of the go&s;pel; and no more de&s;ires the &s;al|vation of it, than he fears the de&s;truction which it threatens. But con&s;ideration, at the &s;ame time that excites fear in wicked men, al&s;o awakens in them a de&s;ire of obtaining an intere&s;t in God's favour, that they may be happy here|after. And the hope hereof will operate in conjunction with the fear of the con|trary; both tending to lead the &s;inner to repentance.</P>
<P>THUS it appears, that thinking on our ways is naturally conducive to repen|tance and reformation, as it tends to a|waken and rouze the chief, governing principles in human nature; and make them operate conjunctly to that end. Rea&s;on, con&s;cience, gratitude, fear and hope, are, by means of &s;erious reflexion, properly directed, and put into action in &s;uch a manner, that it may be naturally expected, a reformation will be the con|&s;equence:
<PB N="350" REF="008667_0355_102fb198335cd590">
Whereas, while &s;inners re|main thoughtle&s;s, the&s;e principles can have no &s;uch effect.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed, other principles in human nature, which will in &s;ome mea&s;ure counteract the&s;e, tending to ob&s;truct them in their operation, and to prevent that good effect which has been &s;poken of; I mean our &s;en&s;ual and worldly pa&s;&s;ions. For "the &s;pirit lu&s;t|eth again&s;t the fle&s;h, and the fle&s;h again&s;t the &s;pirit; and the&s;e two are contrary one to the other." We all of us "&s;ee a law in our members, warring again&s;t the law of our minds," and too often "bringing us into captivity to the law of &s;in." Yea, this law of &s;in that is in our members, is &s;o powerful, that it will finally prevail over rea&s;on and con&s;ci|ence, hope and fear, and every good natural principle, if we are left intirely to our&s;elves. And, therefore, nothing which has been &s;aid above, concerning the natural tendency of thinking on our ways, to reform us, mu&s;t be under&s;tood to mean, that it will ever actually pro|duce this effect, without the Spirit and grace of God concurring,</P>
<P>IT is an undoubted truth, and doctrine of &s;cripture, that &s;inners, how much &s;o|ever they may think on their ways, do
<PB N="351" REF="008667_0356_102fb199c03d33f8">
not obtain a victory over their lu&s;ts, merely by their own power, but only thro' God, working in and with them; or thro' "&s;anctification of the Spirit unto obedience." In conformity to, and con|&s;i&s;tence with, which important doctrine, whatever has been &s;aid above, is to be under&s;tood. Nor are the&s;e things incon|&s;i&s;tent with each other. Altho' we are not able, as of our&s;elves, to do any thing to purpo&s;e in religion; yet it may be true, that thinking on our ways is a ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;tep to reformation, and a natu|ral means thereof. It may be a real means hereof, and conducive to this end, altho' it be not &s;uch a one, as will take effect, or be effectual to that end, with|out the ble&s;&s;ing of God. And we have great rea&s;on from &s;cripture, to hope that, when ever wicked men are led &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect on their ways, and are heartily de&s;irous of amending them, God will graciou&s;ly afford them all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance nece&s;&s;ary hereto, &s;o that the event &s;hall be, their &s;aving conver&s;ion to him. Being thus awakened to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their &s;in and danger, and being &s;en&s;ible of their own depravity and weakne&s;s, they will of cour&s;e, implore the grace and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God's Spirit, in order to the mortify|ing of their earthly members, and the re|novation
<PB N="352" REF="008667_0357_102fb19b47b4c358">
of their hearts. And our ble&s;|&s;ed Saviour has declared, that God will "give the holy Spirit to them that a&s;k him." So that there is a plain probabili|ty, that tho&s;e who think &s;eriou&s;ly on their ways, will eventually turn their feet unto God's te&s;timonies; and that He who has begun a good work in them, will perfect it unto the day of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>THOSE who have been awakened into a &s;en&s;e of their &s;ins, and who now think &s;eriou&s;ly on their ways, may rea&s;onably take &s;ome encouragement from what has been di&s;cour&s;ed above. They have great cau&s;e of thankfulne&s;s to God, that they have been rouzed from a &s;tate of thought|le&s;s &s;ecurity, by whatever means this has been done; and that they have at length &s;ome concern about their eternal &s;alva|tion. This is a hopeful &s;ymptom; it is a token for good to them; and may pro|bably be followed by a throrough con|ver&s;ion from &s;in to God.</P>
<P>BUT whatever probability there may be hereof, it mu&s;t be allowed, there is no certainty. Tho' &s;uch per&s;ons &s;eem not to be far from the kingdom of hea|ven, they may yet never enter into it. Sinners are not, by being thus brought to think on their ways, or even by refor|ming them in &s;ome degree, put beyond
<PB N="353" REF="008667_0358_102fb19e15fa5f90">
the po&s;&s;ibility and danger of a relap&s;e, and &s;o of finally mi&s;carrying. They have ground for hope, but none for confi|dence or pre&s;umption. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, or rather plainly a&s;&s;erted, in the holy &s;criptures, that &s;ome who are awakened to a great concern about their &s;ins, and &s;piritual &s;tate, who begin hopefully, and do many things gladly, become carele&s;s and incon&s;iderate again after a time; and return to their former &s;inful cour&s;es. It is &s;aid of &s;ome, that their goodne&s;s is as the morning cloud, and early dew, that &s;oon pa&s;&s;eth away. Some of tho&s;e, who are &s;aid to have e&s;caped the corruptions that are in the world, thro' the know|ledge of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be again entang|led, and overcome by them: Who are compared to the "dog returning to his vomit"; and "the &s;ow that was wa&s;hed, to her wallowing in the mire." It is &s;uppo&s;ed, that tho&s;e may fall away, who have once been enlightened, and have ta&s;ted the heavenly gift, and the powers of the world to come; yea, tho&s;e that have in &s;ome mea&s;ure and manner, been "made partakers of the holy Gho&s;t". Our Saviour, in his parable of the &s;ower, &s;peaks of &s;ome, who receive the word with joy; but yet endure only for a time,
<PB N="354" REF="008667_0359_102fb1a42b6154d8">
being by and by offended, when temp|tations and trials come. And &s;uch apo&s;|tates as the&s;e, often, if not always, be|come more hardened and profligate than ever they were. So that the apo&s;tle &s;ays, it had been better for them not to have known the way of life, than thus to de|part from the holy commandment deli|vered to them. And it is of &s;uch per&s;ons, that tho&s;e remarkable words of our Savi|our are commonly interpreted, (Luke XII) "When the unclean &s;pirit is gone out of a man, he walketh thro' dry pla|ces, &s;eeking re&s;t: And finding none, he &s;aith, I will return unto my hou&s;e, whence I came out. And when he com|eth, he findeth it &s;wept and garni&s;hed.&mdash; Then goeth he and taketh with him &s;e|ven other &s;pirits more wicked than him|&s;elf: And they enter in, and dwell there. <HI>And the latter &s;tate of that man is wor&s;e than the fir&s;t.</HI>"</P>
<P>I WOULD qualify what has been &s;aid in the former part of this di&s;cour&s;e, by reminding you of the&s;e repre&s;entations in the holy &s;criptures; which &s;how the po&s;&s;ibility and danger of awakened &s;in|ners, yea, of partially reformed ones, returning, after a time, to their vicious cour&s;es; and dying at la&s;t in their ini|quities.

things with a de&s;ign to throw any need|le&s;s di&s;couragements in the way of tho&s;e, who are become thoughtful, and are &s;eriou&s;ly concerned about their &s;alvation: God forbid! By &s;ugge&s;ting their dan|ger to them, I mean to keep them from pre&s;umption; to excite them to great watchfulne&s;s, and diligence in working out their &s;alvation: Le&s;t becoming &s;e|cure by degrees, they &s;hould fall away, thro' the temptations of this evil world, and the devices of Satan; becoming more hardened and abandoned than ever, in&s;tead of being eventually the better for their pre&s;ent concern about their &s;pi|ritual &s;tate.</P>
<P>BUT, beloved, we would hope "bet|ter things of you, and things that ac|company &s;alvation, tho' we thus &s;peak." There is ground of hope concerning tho&s;e of you, who now think &s;eriou&s;ly on your ways, tho' you are not out of danger. It becomes you both to watch and to pray, that you enter not into temptation. Depend not too much on your own &s;trength; but look up to God for his grace and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in an humble &s;en&s;e of your weakne&s;s. It is He only, that is able to keep you from falling, and finally to pre&s;ent you before his glorious pre&s;ence with exceeding joy. If you

&s;eek him with your whole heart, he will be found of you: He will afford you all needed mea&s;ures of his grace and Spirit, for your &s;anctification, and pre&s;ervation in the way of life and &s;alvation. But if you for&s;ake him, and become carele&s;s and thoughtle&s;s of the things that belong to your peace, he will al&s;o for&s;ake you, and give you up to your own hearts lu&s;t. Take heed, that you do not lo&s;e tho&s;e &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions, which you are now, any of you, under. How &s;ad would be your &s;tate and condition, if you &s;hould return to &s;in and folly, after being in &s;uch a hopeful way to obtain the &s;alvation of your &s;ouls! You doubt|le&s;s now look with &s;ome degree of pity on all tho&s;e, who appear to have no con|cern about their &s;ins, and their eternal intere&s;t, if there are any &s;uch among&s;t us at this time. They are indeed ob|jects of pity. But if you your&s;elves, after being thus awakened to a &s;en&s;e of your &s;in and danger, &s;hould grow &s;ecure, and give your&s;elves up to work iniquity, your ca&s;e would be then more &s;ad and de&s;perate than their's is at pre&s;ent. There would then be hardly any hopes of your "being renewed again unto repentance." Good impre&s;&s;ions lo&s;t, u&s;ually leave the heart more callous and hardened than it

was at fir&s;t, before tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions were made on it.

And this appears evident from the &s;everal arguments that were in&s;i&s;ted on in the two fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;es: From a general con&s;ideration of God's power and greatne&s;s, his holine&s;s and univer&s;al dominion, and our ab&s;olute dependence upon him: From the clear and po&s;itive denunciations of his wrath, in his word, again&s;t all impenitent, irreclaimable tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors:
<PB N="360" REF="008667_0365_102fb1b4692825e8">
From the great and precious promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, made to tho&s;e who turn at God's reproof: And la&s;tly, From a con&s;ideration of that a&s;toni&s;hing method which God has projected for our &s;alvation from &s;in and death. It is cer|tainly a matter of infinite importance to us, to reverence and obey the great Lord of heaven and earth, in who&s;e hand our breath is, and who&s;e are all our ways. It infinitely concerns &s;inners to fly from the wrath to come, that wrath of God, which is revealed from heaven again&s;t all ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men, and revealed in language &s;o full of terror. Is it not of infinite importance to us, to obtain an intere&s;t in the ble&s;&s;ed promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, the promi&s;es of pardon and eternal life? And it mu&s;t needs give us a deeper &s;en&s;e of this im|portance, if we con&s;ider the Son of God as coming down from heaven, and &s;uf|fering and dying for our &s;alvation. The fir&s;t point is, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ufficiently con|firmed and illu&s;trated by the&s;e con&s;idera|tions, which were di&s;tinctly enlarged on in their order.</P>
<P>THE SECOND general head of di&s;|cour&s;e was, To &s;how the va&s;t importance of <HI>making ha&s;te</HI> to keep God's command|ments, and the extreme folly and danger
<PB N="361" REF="008667_0366_102fb1b5f18e5338">
of <HI>delaying</HI> it. Human life is &s;hort and uncertain: &s;o that we cannot depend up|on any future opportunity to make our peace with God, if we neglect the pre|&s;ent. But if we were certain of another, yet delay will render the work of refor|mation more difficult and painful. The plea&s;ures attending a religious and virtu|ous life, are far &s;uperior to tho&s;e of &s;in and folly; and the &s;ooner we begin to fear and &s;erve God, the &s;ooner &s;hall we begin to be truly happy. The greater al&s;o will be our progre&s;s towards chri&s;|tain perfection, and the greater our re|ward in heaven. Piety and virtue are peculiarly amiable in youth; and we &s;hall do much more honor to God and our Redeemer by an early, than by a late repentance. To delay, is the ba&s;e&s;t in|gratitude. It is al&s;o &s;uch daring impiety, that we may well fear, God will utterly withdraw his holy Spirit from tho&s;e, who continue long in their &s;ins; giving them up to their own hearts lu&s;t, and leaving them to, trea&s;ure up unto them&s;elves wrath again&s;t the day of wrath. The&s;e arguments were enlarged upon in &s;even di&s;cour&s;es; and all who duly con&s;ider them, mu&s;t needs acknowledge the im|portance of <HI>making ha&s;te</HI> to keep the com|mandments of God.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="008667_0367_102fb1bd75cb0ea0">THE THIRD general head of di&s;cour&s;e was, To &s;how the rea&s;onablene&s;s of <HI>think|ing on our ways,</HI> together with the nece&s;|&s;ity and conducivene&s;s hereof, to a re|formation of them. We cannot better employ tho&s;e rational faculties which God has given us, than by thinking &s;e|riou&s;ly of our own ways; by reflecting, what manner of life we have lived; what our religious &s;tate is; what we have to hope, or what to fear, in the way and cour&s;e we are in at pre&s;ent. Certainly &s;uch thoughts and inquiries become us, as we are rea&s;onable creatures, made for virtue and religion, and are to be happy or mi&s;erable in another world, ac|cording to our behaviour in this. Unle&s;s we think on the&s;e things, we &s;hall think only of &s;uch as are vain and trifling in compari&s;on of them. 'Till we thus think on our ways, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for us to a mend them, how much &s;oever they may need reforming. And, on the other hand, when we properly reflect on our ways, there is ground to hope, that we &s;hall actually turn our feet unto God's te&s;timonies; the former naturally lead|ing to the latter.

<P>IT is &s;trange that any &s;hould be tho't|le&s;s about their &s;piritual &s;tate, and their eternal intere&s;t, con&s;idering how many things daily occur to rouze us to &s;erious reflexion on them. We do not live a &s;ingle day, without having admonitions of one kind or other, to this end. The whole vi&s;ible creation, which proclaims the perfections and glory of God, and reminds us of our dependence on him, is an ince&s;&s;ant, unwearied monitor to us. The &s;un, moon and &s;tars preach to us, night and day: And the mo&s;t common events of providence, are in&s;tructive and monitory. In which re&s;pect,
<Q>Wi&s;dom crieth without, &s;he uttereth her voice in the &s;treets: She crieth in the chief place of concour&s;e, in the opening of the gates; in the city &s;he uttereth her words, &s;aying, How long, ye &s;imple ones, will ye love &s;implicity? and the &s;corners delight in their &s;corning, and fools hate knowledge?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="008667_0369_102fb1c11e2ccec8">WE are &s;till more explicitly admoni|&s;hed of our duty by the holy &s;criptures, which we have in our hands. The&s;e &s;acred oracles, to be &s;ure, are profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s. So that while we have the written word of God, yea, while the world &s;tandeth, and the cour&s;e of nature is maintained, we can never want admonitions to think of God, and of our ways, and to keep his commandments.

<P>BUT be&s;ides the&s;e con&s;tant monitors; be&s;ides this word, and the&s;e works of God, which preach uninterruptedly and uniformly to the world, from age to age; be&s;ides the&s;e, I &s;ay, there are ma|ny particular di&s;pen&s;ations of providence towards our&s;elves, which ought in rea|&s;on to awaken us to a &s;erious &s;en&s;e of religion, and which, being di&s;regarded, leave us the more inexcu&s;able. All the &s;ignal mercies and ble&s;&s;ings which God be&s;tows upon us, are admonitions to re|member, to love him, and to keep his commandments.

the holy &s;criptures more frequently re|pre&s;ent afflictions and calamities, as de|&s;igned to awaken and reform us, than they do the outward ble&s;&s;ings and &s;miles of providence. In this light we ought to look upon &s;ickne&s;s, pains, lo&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments, and all kinds of world|ly adver&s;ity in general. They are the corrections and cha&s;ti&s;ements of divine providence; de&s;igned to bring us to a &s;en&s;e of our &s;ins; to wean our affections from this world, and to make us &s;eek our happine&s;s in God, and his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>WE are all in common admoni&s;hed, in the&s;e &s;everal ways, to think on God and our duty, and to turn our feet unto his te&s;timonies; by his works which we daily behold; by his word; by his mer|cies, and by his cha&s;tening hand. But there are &s;ome other vi&s;itations of provi|dence of a mixed nature, &s;o that we can hardly tell whether they ought to be called mercies or afflictions; which are yet plainly monitory in their de&s;ign; loud calls to think on, and to amend our ways. I have here more particularly in view, the late earthquakes, which were the more immediate occa&s;ion of the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider the terror and amazement that earthquakes naturally
<PB N="366" REF="008667_0371_102fb1c46edda288">
bring with them, even tho' the harm done by them may be incon&s;iderable, we can hardly help looking on them as the judgments of heaven, at lea&s;t as intima|tions of God's righteous di&s;plea&s;ure, and warnings from him. The earthquakes which lately &s;hook this part of the con|tinent, were not productive of any great cata&s;trophe, as &s;ometimes happens; but they occa&s;ioned a general terror; and indeed, we had, in the time of them, great rea&s;on to apprehend fatal con&s;e|quences from them. God hereby threat|ned us, and put us in fear: his hand was apparently lifted up, tho' he did not &s;trike the awful blow, which &s;eemed coming upon us. And when we reflect, that our lives were pre&s;erved in this time of vi&s;ible danger; that we were only alarmed, not de&s;troyed, but delivered from threatned ruin; the vi&s;itations, in this re&s;pect, &s;eem kind, favourable and merciful: And the more &s;o, when we con&s;ider the great de&s;olations lately wrought by earthquakes in &s;ome other places.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Li&s;bon, and &s;ome parts of Africa.</NOTE> When we lay all circum&s;tances together, &s;ome people may po&s;&s;ibly be in doubt, whether we ought to con&s;ider the&s;e vi&s;itations as judgments, or as mer|cies; whether we have more rea&s;on to
<PB N="367" REF="008667_0372_102fb1ca29f9ae88">
humble our&s;elves, as being under the frowns of divine providence, or to re|joice and be thankful, on account of our pre&s;ervation, when we were in &s;uch apparent danger.</P>
<P>WHICH of the&s;e would be the ju&s;ter &s;entiment of the two, I will not be very po&s;itive; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary to determine that point. We have plainly, on one hand, great rea&s;on to humble our&s;elves under the&s;e alarming vi&s;itations; and to look on them as warnings and threat|nings from God, ju&s;tly provoked at our &s;ins. On the other hand, we have a|bundant cau&s;e for prai&s;e and gratitude to him, that he has mercifully &s;pared us; and not brought upon us the de&s;truction, we had &s;o much rea&s;on to fear. There is, in &s;uch-like vi&s;itations, a mixture of divine di&s;plea&s;ure and kindne&s;s? &s;o that we may &s;ing, both of judgment and mercy, on account of them. However, I cannot but think, upon the whole, that they are much more properly called judgments, or manife&s;tations of God's righteous di&s;plea&s;ure, than mercies, or tokens of his favour and kindne&s;s. No man looks upon pain and &s;ickne&s;s&punc; where|by his life is endangered&punc; as ble&s;&s;ings, con&s;idered in them&s;elves&punc; tho', if his life is pre&s;erved notwith&s;tanding, that is

doubtle&s;s a mercy, which demands his thanks and prai&s;es to God. The ma|riner does not con&s;ider the &s;torm and tempe&s;t, whereby he is put
<Q>at his wit's end,</Q>
as ble&s;&s;ings, or tokens of God's favour; tho', if he is &s;aved from &s;hip|wrack, he looks on this as a mercy, and giveth God thanks. The child, the &s;er|vant, the &s;ubject, look on the rod, the &s;courge, and ax, &s;haken at them, as &s;hown to them in di&s;plea&s;ure, not as marks of favour in the parent, ma&s;ter and &s;ove|reign; tho' the laying of them a&s;ide, may be con&s;idered as a token of kindne&s;s and mercy. The application of the&s;e &s;imilitudes to the point in hand, is ob|vious and ea&s;y. In this light, I &s;uppo&s;e, we ought to look on the&s;e late vi&s;itati|ons of providence; I mean, as minatory, or as intimations of God's di&s;plea&s;ure a|gain&s;t us: But their pa&s;&s;ing over, and leaving us in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our lives, and the ble&s;&s;ings of life, as before, mu&s;t needs be acknowledged as a token of God's fatherly goodne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion. But, view them in what light we plea&s;e, we mu&s;t, unle&s;s we are mere athei&s;ts, &s;uppo&s;e the general de&s;ign of them is, to excite us to a &s;erious con&s;ideration, and an amendment of our ways; as loud pro|vidential calls to fear God, and keep his commandments.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="008667_0374_102fb1cd761d4580">MANY per&s;ons among&s;t us have doubt|le&s;s been put upon very &s;erious reflexion, as well as terrified, by the&s;e vi&s;itations of providence.

There has probably been no age or period of the world, wherein events have more nearly corre&s;ponded to this prophetic de&s;cription, than the pre&s;ent; tho' as was intimated before, I do not pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that the&s;e are the very times fore|told.</P>
