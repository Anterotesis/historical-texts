<P>ONE Objection made again&s;t the goodne&s;s of divine Providence which a late Learned Writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Sherlock's</HI> Di&s;cour&s;e of the Divine Providence. Pag. 324. Edit. 4.</NOTE> takes notice of, is, <HI>God'</HI>s <HI>Partial &amp; unequal Care of his creatures;</HI> the foundation of which Ob|jection is; <HI>that there are various Ranks &amp; Con|ditions of men in the world; Rich and Poor, High and Low, Princes and Subjects,</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> But how|ever athei&s;tical wits may argue from the va|riety of mens Conditions, certain it is that the various Ranks and degrees of men are for the advantage and benefit of mankind in Ge|neral, in as much as without this variety, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f all mens Conditions were alike, men would want &s;ome Motives and Encouragements to

Vertue &amp; Re&s;traint from Vice, that now they have; and there could be no &s;uch thing as Government in the world, which is a thing &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the well-being of it, that any thing conducive hereunto Rather argues a good Providence over the world, than the Contrary.</P>
<P>Government is a great Ble&s;&s;ing to this Sinful &amp; Mi&s;erable world, &amp; if it &s;hould be de&s;titute thereof, it would &s;oon become a heap of Confu&s;ion, a &s;tage of mournful Trage|dies, a Theater of woful Spectacles; the whole world might fitly be called, Aceldama, a field of Blood; or Golgotha, a place of a Scull. One man would be as a wolf to another, the wicked would devour the man that is more Righteous than he, men would be as the fi&s;hes of the Sea, &amp; as the creeping things, that have no Ruler over them, as the Prophet &s;peaks&punc; Hab. 1&punc; 13. What God &s;aith of the old world. Gen. 6&punc; 13&punc; <HI>The Earth is filled with violence&punc;</HI> would &s;oon become true of the world now if de&s;titute of Government.</P>
<P>Government being &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing, and con&s;equently the variety of mens conditions in the world, and their &s;ubordination one to another, which is nece&s;&s;ary to the very being of it; The mo&s;t High God, who <HI>will not give his glory to another, nor his prai&s;e to graven Images,</HI> I&s;a. 42. 8. hath &s;ufficiently taught us in his

word, to whom we are beholding for it; &amp; that it hath an higher &amp; more Excellent Ori|ginal, than only the pride, ambition, &amp; Crafty de&s;igns of &s;ome a&s;piring mortals, that affect a Superiority over others and can bear to be &s;e|cond to none in honour and power; Even his own wi&s;e and gracious providence over the world.</P>
<P>To this End we are Taught, that <HI>there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no power but of God, that the powers that be are or|dained of God.</HI> Rom. 13. 1. That <HI>by him Kings Reign, and princes decree ju&s;tice. That by him princes Rule &amp; nobles, Even all the Judges of the Earth&punc;</HI> Prov. 8. 15, 16. That <HI>he removeth Kings and &s;etteth up Kings.</HI> Dan. 2. 21. And be&s;ides many other places that might be mentioned, we are Taught this Le&s;&s;on in our Text and Context&punc; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that <HI>promotion cometh not from the Ea&s;t, nor from the We&s;t, nor from the South; but God is the Judge he putteth down one, and &s;etteth up another.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the Penman and occa&s;ion of this p&s;alm wherein our Text is, there is vari|ety of opinions among&s;t Expo&s;itors, (as may be &s;een by Mr Pool'<HI>s</HI> Collections in his Criti|ca Sacra, and his Engli&s;h Annotations&punc;) Some being of opinion that it was compo&s;ed in the Babyloni&s;h Captivity &amp; written in form of a Dialogue, tho' there be no mention made of the per&s;ons &s;peaking therein. Others that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

was compo&s;ed by A&s;aph in Davids time, and in his name and per&s;on, as it is not unu&s;ual for poets to bring in princes &s;peaking in their poems. Others that it was compo&s;ed by David him&s;elf, and with this opinion the Learned Ames<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ames.</HI> Lectiones in P&s;almes in Loc.</NOTE> concurs.</P>
<P>The P&s;alm &s;eems to Relate to the time when Saul &amp; other of Davids Enemies were overthrown, and he had Entered upon the Kingdom of I&s;rael, altho' he had not Gotten full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. And herein David in the name of other pious per&s;ons profe&s;&s;eth his Thankfulne&s;s unto God for his wonderful providence over all things, and in &s;pecial to|wards him&s;elf v. 1. <HI>Unto thee, O God do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near, thy wondrous works do declare.</HI> And then he makes a promi&s;e agreeable to &s;uch a frame of &s;pirit, Even that he would do the duty of a Ju&s;t &amp; pious Ruler. v. 2. <HI>When I &s;hall receive the Congregation, I will Judge uprightly.</HI> This general Promi&s;e he &s;eems more parti|cularly to Explain, in the following ver&s;es, in that he Promi&s;es to Endeavour to Re&s;tore the Decayed &s;tate of Things in his Kingdom v. 3. <HI>The Earth and all the Inhabitants of it are Di&s;|&s;olved: I bear up the Pillars of it, Selah.</HI> or&mdash;<HI>I will bear up</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> as Tremellius &amp; Junius Ren|der

it. And as a means to this Re&s;titution of things in his Kingdom, that he would &s;up|pre&s;s the Madne&s;s &amp; Haughtine&s;s of the wick|ed. v. 4, 5. <HI>I &s;aid unto the fools deal not &s;o fooli&s;h|ly; &amp; to the wicked, lift not up the horn Lift <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ot up your horn on high: &s;peak not with a &s;tiff neck.</HI> And the more Effectually to Suppre&s;s their haughtine&s;s, he refutes &amp; condemns one great Errour of theirs, about the Exaltation or de|pre&s;&s;ion of this or that man. Shewing that it is not to be a&s;cribed to chance, or humane policy &amp; power, but to that wi&s;e &amp; powerful providence which God Exerci&s;eth over the world. v. 6, 7 <HI>For promotion cometh neither from the Ea&s;t, nor from the We&s;t, nor from the South. But God is the Judge: he putteth down one, &amp; &s;etteth up another.</HI></P>
<P>In the ver&s;e now Read, we may Ob&s;erve</P>
<P N="1">1. The per&s;on &s;poken of, the Mo&s;t High God.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Relation he &s;tands in to his crea|tures&punc; <HI>he is the Judge.</HI> The Judge by way of Eminency. It is the work of a Judge to De|termine matters of Right. To Di&s;tribute Rewards and Puni&s;hments. To Determine Controver&s;ies Relating to Commutative Ju&s;|tice. In the&s;e Re&s;pects God may be Called the Judge. He determines the Eternal &s;tate of men. Rom. 2. 16. And al&s;o he determines what their Condition in this world &s;hall be,
<PB N="6" REF="002323_0008_0FDC0F576C1E20E0">
whether high or low, whether they &s;hall be Rich or poor, the men of the world are as &s;o many Rivals, Competitors or Candidates for Riches &amp; honours, &amp; God as Judge, doth by his all governing providence, pa&s;s Sentence, who &s;hall have them &amp; who &s;hall go without them. Again a Judge Sometimes in Scripture Signifies the chief Ruler in a &s;tate. So in I&s;rael before Saul'<HI>s</HI> Reign the Chief Rulers were called Judges. Ruth. 1. 1. <HI>Now it came to pa&s;s in the dayes when the Judges Ruled.</HI> God may be Called the Judge in this &s;en&s;e. Be|cau&s;e the whole world is governed by him.</P>
<P N="3">3. We may herein ob&s;erve tho&s;e works that are a&s;cribed to God, that are agreeable to &s;uch a Relation. He putteth down one &amp; &s;etteth up another. He di&s;po&s;eth of men to their Several Ranks &amp; po&s;ts, as the chief Ru|ler of a &s;tate conferreth offices and places of tru&s;t on &s;ome, and degrades others, So the mo&s;t High depre&s;&s;eth and Exalteth whom he plea&s;eth. Dan&punc; 4. 17.</P>
<P>DOCT. That God is the Supreme Ruler of the world, and he placeth all per&s;ons in their Several Stations and Conditions.</P>
<P>The Doctrine may be branched into two Particulars.</P>

II. <HI>That he placeth all per&s;ons in their Several Stations and Conditions.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I. <HI>God is the Supreme Ruler of the world.</HI> He governs the world, &amp; not in Subordination to any Superiour power. All other beings that are in power in the univer&s;e are &s;ubject to him, but he is &s;ubject to none. <HI>That God is the Supreme Ruler of the world appears.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>From that wi&s;dom and power that is di&s;co|vered in the Government of the world.</HI> Infinite wi&s;dom and Infinite power are peculiar to &amp; In&s;eperable from Gods works. Prov. 8. 30 P&s;al. 111. 7. This wi&s;dom &amp; power appears in the government of the world. And con|&s;equently God is the Ruler of it. This wi&s;|dom &amp; power appears <HI>in Gods common Govern|ment:</HI> what Le&s;s than Infinite wi&s;dom and power could make the Luminaries of heaven, by an uniform &amp; &s;teady motion to De&s;cribe to men the times &amp; &s;ea&s;ons, like &s;ome publick Clock or Dial. as P&s;al. 104. 19 <HI>He appointeth the moon for &s;ea&s;ons; the Sun Knoweth his going down.</HI> It is beyond finite power &amp; wi&s;dom to make the Thunder &amp; Lightning, a thing &s;o powerful and ungovernable by man, to help Gods People &amp; puni&s;h their Enemies, &amp; yet it doth this. P&s;al. 18. 13, 14. Or to make the fire, hail, &s;now and vapour, and &s;tormy wind to fulfil his word&punc; as P&s;al. 148. 8. To

make the Frogs, Lice, Flies, and Locu&s;ts to puni&s;h the Egyptians. The Quails to come in &s;uch va&s;t numbers and at &s;et times to the Camp of the I&s;raelites to feed them; the Ra|vens to feed Elijah, or the worms to De&s;troy Herod when he gave not God the Glory. It's from this Infinite Wi&s;dom &amp; Power that the Stork in the heavens Knows he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> appointed times, and the Turtle Crane and Swallow the Time of her Coming. Jer. 8. 7. That the ants prepare their meat in Summer, the Conies make their hou&s;es in the Rocks, and the Lo|cu&s;ts go forth by bands. Prov. 30. 25, 26, 27. Yea from this wi&s;dom and power it is that wicked men are made to &s;erve the Great Ends of Providence, to Puni&s;h one another, and to Cha&s;ti&s;e Gods People. I&s;ai. 10. 5, 6, 7. <HI>O A&s;&s;yrian the Rod of mine anger, and the Staff in their hand is mine Indignation. I will &s;end him again&s;t an Hypocritical Nation; and again&s;t the people of my wrath will I give him a Charge to take the Spoil, &amp; to take the Prey, &amp; to tread them Down like the mire of the &s;treets. Howbeit he meaneth not &s;o, neither doth his heart think &s;o, but it is in his heart to Cut off &amp; De&s;troy Nations not a few.</HI> Further &s;uch a wi&s;dom &amp; &s;uch a power appear <HI>in Special Government.</HI> The Redemption of mankind &amp; Gods great works relating to his Church belong to This, and herein a <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> above that which is finite is

con&s;picuous not only to men but Even to Angels. Eph 3. 10. <HI>To the intent that now unto the principalities &amp; powers in heavenly places might be Known by the Church the manifold wi&s;dom of God.</HI> And &s;uch a <HI>Power</HI> is manife&s;ted by the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t from the Dead, by the Pre&s;ervation of Gods church in the world, &amp; by the Conver&s;ion of Sinners. Eph. 1&punc; 19. And what is the Exceeding greatne&s;s of his power to us ward who believe according to the working of his mighty power.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That God is the Supreme Ruler of the world appears, from his foretelling future Events, &amp; his Exact &amp; Infallible accompli&s;hment of them.</HI> God foretels things that are contingent as to Se|cond Cau&s;es, a great while beforehand, and Exactly accompli&s;heth them. Thus he fore|told to Abraham the affliction of his po&s;terity in Egypt &amp; their Deliverance. Gen. 15. 13, 14. The Babyloni&s;h Captivity of Seventy years, &amp; their Deliverance by Cyrus who is mention|ed by name a long while before he was born. I&s;a. 44. 28 &amp; 45. 1. Likewi&s;e the great power of the Grecian and Roman Monarchs before they appeared in the world. By the Prophet Daniel. And al&s;o many circum&s;tances of the Incarnation and Sufferings of Chri&s;t, as they were afterward accompli&s;hed. Now &s;eeing God foretels &s;uch things as they come to pa&s;s, it is Evident that he is the chief ruler
<PB N="10" REF="002323_0012_0FDC0F61F861EA08">
of the world, and that there is not any other being, that is Equal with, or &s;uperiour to him, to fru&s;trate his De&s;igns. God him&s;elf u&s;eth this argument with his people to convince them that he alone is God. I&s;a. 46. 9, 10. <HI>Remember the former things of old, for I am God, &amp; there is none El&s;e, I am God &amp; there is none like me&punc; Declaring the End from the Beginning, &amp; from Ancient times the things that are not yet done, Saying, My Coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand. &amp; I will do all my Plea&s;ure.</HI> Now he that is God alone without any Superiour or Equal, mu&s;t be Su|preme Ruler of the world.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This is Evident, becau&s;e all things are &s;ubject to Gods Government.</HI> P&s;al. 103. 19. <HI>The Lord hath prepared his Throne in the heavens: and his Kingdom Ruleth over all</HI> Great and Potent Creatures are Governed by him. He Ruleth the Raging of the Sea. P&s;al. 89&punc; 9. The Winds and the Sea Obey him. Mat. 8. 27. Earthly Rulers are &s;ubject to his government. Prov. 21. 1. <HI>The Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord as the Rivers of water: he turneth it whi|ther&s;oever he will.</HI> Yea Even the angels that Excel in &s;trength are governed by God. They do his commandments, hearken to his word, and are mini&s;ters of his that do his plea&s;ure. P&s;al. 103. 20, 21. And God is &s;aid to Rule in the armies of heaven as well as among the Inhabitants of the Earth. Dan. 4. 35 Yea
<PB N="11" REF="002323_0013_0FDC0F65E67FF118">
Weak &s;mall &amp; minute beings are not Exempt|ed from his Government; for Even a &s;parrow doth not fall to the Ground without our hea|venly Father. Now he that hath all things under his Government mu&s;t needs be the Supreme Ruler of the world.</P>
<P>II. <HI>God placeth all per&s;ons in their re&s;pective Stations &amp; Conditions;</HI> As the place of mens abode is ordered by God&punc; Act. 17. 26. So is their Rank, condition and Quality, as in the ver&s;e of our Text.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Per&s;ons of Low degree have their condition a&s;&s;igned them by God.</HI> Whether men are brought Low as a puni&s;hment for Sin or for any other wi&s;e &amp; holy End, Gods providence is to be acknowleged therein Job 1. 21&mdash;The Lord Gave, &amp; the Lord hath Taken away.&mdash;Men may &s;ometimes be &s;aid to bring them|&s;elves Low. Ho&s;. 14. 1. <HI>O I&s;rael return thou unto the Lord thy God; for thou ha&s;t fallen by thine Iniquities.</HI> Sin in General is a lowering, &s;ink|ing thing Prov. 14. 24 But &s;ome Sins are peculiarly &s;o. Some Sins are di&s;honouring &amp; di&s;graceful. As whoredom &amp; adultery. Prov. 6 33. <HI>A wound &amp; di&s;honour &s;hall he Get.</HI> Theft. Jer. 2. 26. <HI>A Thief is a&s;hamed when he is found&mdash;Lying.</HI> Prov. 19. 22. <HI>A poor man is better than a Liar.</HI> Some Sins are Impoveri&s;hing. As Un|cleanne&s;s. Prov. 6. 26. <HI>By means of a whori&s;h

woman a man is brought to a piece of bread.</HI> In|temperance. Prov. 23. 21. The Drunkard &amp; the Glutton &s;hall come to poverty&mdash;Inju&s;tice is al&s;o Impoveri&s;hing. Prov. 11. 24.&mdash;<HI>There is that witholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.</HI> So is Idlene&s;s. Prov. 23. 21&mdash;<HI>Drow|&s;ine&s;s &s;hall clothe a man with Rags.</HI> The like may be &s;aid of Keeping bad Company. Prov&punc; 28. 19&mdash;<HI>He that followeth after vain per&s;ons &s;hall have poverty Enough.</HI> But although men may by Sin Bring them&s;elves low, yet Gods Providence is not to be Excluded, upon this account; although he is Righteous in all his ways &amp; holy in all his works; yet &s;ome things are &s;aid to be done by him which are brought about by Sinful means. Thus God is &s;aid to &s;end Jo&s;eph into Egypt. Gen. 45. 5 And to Exalt Baa&s;ha 1 Kings. 16 2 When as both were brought about by Sinful means Hence God is &s;aid to make poor. 1 Sam 2. 7. And to pour contempt upon princes. P&s;al&punc; 107. 40.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Per&s;ons of high Degree are Exalted by God.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>He Exalteth tho&s;e that are above others in wealth &amp; Riches.</HI> Tho' God hath Given the Earth to the Sons of men. P&s;al. 115 16 Yet all have not an Equal &s;hare in it. And this difference is not to be Imputed only to mens prudence &amp; diligence. But a higher hand is to be acknowledged in the matter Deut. 8. 17, 18. <HI>And thou &s;ay in thine heart, my power</HI> &amp;
<PB N="13" REF="002323_0015_0FDC0F68B9E57CC8">
<HI>the might of mine hand hath Gotten me all this wealth. But thou &s;halt Remember the Lord thy God, for it is he that giveth thee power to Get wealth</HI>&mdash;Mens prudence &amp; diligence may be In&s;trumental to advance their E&s;tates, and Encrea&s;e their Sub&s;tance. But without Gods Ble&s;&s;ing this will not Avail. P&s;al. 127. 2. <HI>It is vain for you to Ri&s;e up Early, to Sit up Late to Eat the Bread of Sorrows.</HI> Therefore Gods Ble&s;&s;ing is &s;aid to make Rich as well as the Diligent Hand. Prov. 10. 22. And God is &s;aid to be the maker of the Rich and Poor&punc; Prov. 22. 2. <HI>The Rich &amp; Poor meet together, the Lord is the maker of them all.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>God Exalteth tho&s;e that are above others in Gifts and parts.</HI> As it is God that makes men in General Wi&s;er than the fowls of hea|ven Job. 35. 11. So it is he that di&s;tingui&s;heth per&s;ons of Great Gifts and Parts from others. Mens Gifts &amp; abilities are the manife&s;tation of the Spirit, and are wrought by that one &amp; the &s;elf &s;ame Spirit that divides to Every one &s;everally as he will. 1 Cor 12. 7, 11. God is the father of Lights &amp; from him Every good Gift &amp; Every perfect Gift comes. Jam. 1. 17. It was God that Gave to Solomon wi&s;dom and Largene&s;s of heart as the &s;and upon the Sea &s;hore. 1 King. 4. 29.</P>

him. Judg. 2. 16. The Lord rai&s;ed them up Judges which delivered them. Godly Rulers are promoted by God. David Stiles him|&s;elf the man that was rai&s;ed up on high. 2 Sam. 23. 1. And acknowledges that it was God that &s;o advanced him. P&s;al. 78. 70. 71. <HI>He cho&s;e David al&s;o his Servant and took him from the Sheepfolds: from following the Ews great with young, he brought him to feed Jacob his people &amp; I&s;rael his Inheritance.</HI> Yea wicked Rulers are beholding to the mo&s;t high for their Ex|altation. 1 Sam. 15. 1. 1 King. 16. 2. Like|wi&s;e church officers are promoted by God.
