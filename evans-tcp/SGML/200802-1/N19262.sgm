<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE MALIGNANT FEVER, Lately prevalent in Philadelphia.</HEAD>
<P>AT the period when the Malignant Fe|ver made its appearance in Philadel|phia, the City, by a &s;eries of pro&s;|perity in commerce, had grown to a &s;tate of opulence not often recorded in the hi&s;toric page. Her inhabitants indulged them&s;elves in all the gratifications of luxury and di&s;&s;ipation, to be procured in this We&s;t|ern hemi&s;phere. Her &s;treets were crouded by the gay carriages of plea&s;ure, going and returning in every direction; new and ele|gant buildings were &s;een ri&s;ing in every quarter; and her port was thronged with &s;hipping from every trading country in Eu|rope, and both the Indies: like Tyre of old
<PB N="4" REF="025075_0004_0FCE4B36212FDD68">
<Q>her merchants were princes, and her traffickers were the honourable of the earth.</Q> This uncommon &s;low of pro&s;|perity had its too common effect. The ci|tizens too generally had forgotten the Fountain from whom all their ble&s;&s;ings flowed; and impiou&s;ly &s;aid or &s;eemed to &s;ay <Q>by thy great wi&s;dom and by thy traf|fic, ha&s;t thou encrea&s;ed thy riches.</Q></P>
<P>By the unfortunate divi&s;ions in St. Domin|go, one of the French I&s;lands, many of its in|habitants, to avoid the fire and &s;word of their &s;tronger antagoni&s;ts, had fled from their homes, and, about the time the contagion took place in Philadelphia, a large number of them &s;ought refuge among us. Before they had left their own burning and bloody &s;hores their hearts had been appalled by &s;cenes of the mo&s;t atrocious cruelty, and by the &s;ight of numerous bodies of the &s;lain which had remained unburied for many days: &s;o that the air mu&s;t have become too polluted for healthful re&s;piration, had they been per|mitted to &s;tay. Many of the&s;e unfortunate refugees came in ve&s;&s;els exceedingly croud|ed; as well as poorly provided with the means nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve health: had they even
<PB N="5" REF="025075_0005_0FCE4B656B266AD0">
left their homes in a &s;tate of &s;oundne&s;s: &s;ome of cour&s;e arrived &s;ickly.</P>
<P>About this time, likewi&s;e, the licen&s;ed plunderers of the Ocean, belonging to the &s;ame nation, brought in their prizes for con|demnation and &s;ale. One of the&s;e freeboot|ers, belonging to Mar&s;eilles in France, (the hot bed of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e) after a leng|thy circuitous cruize, came into our port, and brought with her the Flora, a prize &s;hip, both in a &s;ickly condition. HERE the in|habitants have generally agreed to fix the origin of the late dreadful vi&s;itation. And in this opinion they have been confirmed by the report of two accurate ob&s;ervers, Phy|&s;icians, who had vi&s;ited the &s;ick in the ear|lie&s;t, and every &s;ucceeding &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e. <Q>From all the evidence we have been able to collect,</Q> &s;ay they, "the di&s;|order made it; fir&s;t appearance in water &s;treet, at Richard Denny's lodging hou&s;e, who kept an ordinary frequented by a num|ber of Frenchmen who had lately arrived in &s;ome of the &s;u&s;pected ve&s;&s;els."</P>
<P>"Mrs. Parkin&s;on, who lodged at Mr. Denny's, took the di&s;ea&s;e on the third and di|ed on the &s;eventh of Augu&s;t, two French
<PB N="6" REF="025075_0006_0FCE4B38A246E318">
lads had taken lodgings at Denny's, a few days before the death of Mrs, Parkin&s;on, one of whom was &s;oon after taken ill and died. Immediately after his death, Mr. Denny's daughter &s;ays the other one took lodgings higher up the &s;treet, and died &s;oon after. Mr. and Mrs. Denny, and two of their next door neighbours, al&s;o died of the &s;ame fever, about two weeks after the French lads. Among the next &s;ucceeding victims were Mrs. Lamaigre and Mr. Miller in the fame neighbourhood, and almo&s;t every ca&s;e which occurred for the fir&s;t two weeks could be traced to the &s;ame &s;ource."</P>
<P>"From a comparative view of all the preceding circum&s;tances&mdash;from the conta|gious nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, and from the re|&s;emblance of its leading &s;ymptoms to tho&s;e of the yellow fever of the We&s;t-Indies, there can be no doubt that the contagion, which gave ri&s;e to the di&s;ea&s;e here, was imported. And from its occurring in that part of wa|ter &s;treet, in a few days after the Amelia, Sans Culottes, and Flora arrived, there is the &s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umption, a pre&s;umption amounting almo&s;t to a certainty, that it was introduced and cummunicated by &s;ome of the crew or pa&s;&s;engers, belonging to one or other of the &s;aid ve&s;&s;els."</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="025075_0007_0FCE4B66DC6C90C8">
"That the fever originated from the rotten coffee, as has been &s;ugge&s;ted, is altogether chimerical."</P>
<P>"That the dry and warm &s;tate of our atmo&s;phere had no &s;hare in the generation of the di&s;ea&s;e is reduced to a certain|ty, from the di&s;ea&s;e being at fir&s;t confined to a few particular per&s;ons, and in that par|ticular part of water &s;treet near to the &s;u&s;pected ve&s;&s;els; from its being communicat|ed from tho&s;e to others, and &s;o on, in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>Such hath been the report of Doctors Currie and Cathrall, men of exten&s;ive &s;kill and ob&s;ervation. But this opinion hath been combatted by a phy&s;ician of very con&s;iderable reputation and practice, who hath offered &s;ome rea&s;ons to the public for di&s;&s;enting on this occa&s;ion, from the above mentioned gentlemen, as well as mo&s;t others of their profe&s;&s;ion. He &s;uppo&s;es that the contagion was generated from the &s;tench of a Cargo of damaged coffee, which had been landed near the &s;ame place where it made its fir&s;t appearance; on a &s;uppo&s;iti|on that vegetable putrefaction might pro|duce &s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e. This gentleman has
<PB N="8" REF="025075_0008_0FCE4B39E28B2B90">
de&s;ervedly gained much credit by his noble and humane attention to unhappy patients of the contagion, during its mo&s;t perilous &s;tages; but the majority of his fellow citi|zens think that he has carried the &s;pirit of di&s;covery too far in tracing its origin.</P>
<P>It is certain that neither the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, nor any other &s;imilar to it, has ever vi&s;ited, this city at any preceding time &s;ince it was founded, but what has been undeniably traced to a foreign &s;ource. The city police, perhaps, was never better admini&s;tered; nor its cleanline&s;s more attended to; and if vegetable putrefaction alone were &s;uffici|ent to produce &s;o dire a contagion; &s;urely in the lap&s;e of one hundred years it might have happened, and been a&s;certained be|yond a contradiction. The cleanline&s;s of our &s;treets and wharves has been more neg|lected in former times than lately; they have, al&s;o, been more incommoded by pu|trid vegetable &s;ub&s;tances; and we have had every diver&s;ification of &s;ea&s;ons, wet and dry, hot and cold, that could a&s;&s;i&s;t in pro|ducing &s;uch an effect: and as the learned Doctor has not produced &s;ufficient rea&s;ons to convince a number of his fellow citizens
<PB N="9" REF="025075_0009_0FCE4B6A51D34F08">
of the ju&s;tne&s;s of his opinion in this in&s;tance, he mu&s;t indulge them in believing that the deleterious mia&s;mata was introduced from abroad, and from the &s;ick from on board one of the three ve&s;&s;els before mentioned.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome indeed, who go &s;o far as to &s;ay that if particular men had done their duty; and had not betrayed more in|dulgence to French cruizers, than genuine friendship for this city, we &s;hould never have had occa&s;ion to di&s;pute on &s;o &s;orrow|ful a theme.</P>
<P>From whatever fountain we trace this poi|&s;oned &s;tream it has de&s;troyed the lives of many thou&s;and citizens and &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed worth. Many widows and orphans are left to deplore the lo&s;s of hu&s;|bands and parents: at the acme of its pre|dominance, the univer&s;al complexion of the city was like Ezekiels roll, in&s;cribed from one end to the other with characters of lament|ation and woe.</P>
<P>A particular account of the various &s;ymp|toms of the late malignant fever have been de&s;cribed with great preci&s;ion and per&s;pi|cuity by the ingenious Dr. William Cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rie,
<PB N="10" REF="025075_0010_0FCE4B3B5C523A98">
in a piece publi&s;hed in an early &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e. From which the following brief ab&s;tract is taken and in&s;erted, for the infor|mation of our readers.</P>
<P>"THE patient fir&s;t complains of wearine&s;s and weakne&s;s, which, in a few hours, is &s;uc|ceeded by a &s;en&s;e of chillne&s;s, and an op|pre&s;&s;ive dull pain and giddine&s;s in the head, an oppre&s;&s;ive weight and &s;tricture about the brea&s;t, particularly at the region of the heart, as if the &s;pace was too narrow for its pul&s;ations. The breathing is performed with quickne&s;s and unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ymptoms in mo&s;t ca&s;es, are &s;oon &s;ucceeded by a frequent propen&s;ity to puke, and this by a quick, full, but &s;oft and irre|gular pul&s;e; great heat about the head, neck, and brea&s;t; the &s;kin generally hot and moi&s;t about the neck and forehead, but dry, and but little increa&s;e of heat about the feet and legs.</P>
<P>IF, to the&s;e &s;ymptoms we add an extra|ordinary pro&s;tration of &s;trength or &s;udden debility in the animal functions of the body, we have a perfect de&s;cription of the fever
<PB N="11" REF="025075_0011_0FCE4B6BB88BA988">
under con&s;ideration, from the fir&s;t day of its attack to the third of its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEN no amendment takes place by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or 4th day, mo&s;t of the recited &s;ymptoms become more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and alarming, with the pul&s;e low and &s;unk. Frequent vomiting of matter re&s;embling coffee grounds in co|lour and con&s;i&s;tence, generally occurs before the di&s;ea&s;e terminates, when it proves mor|tal, together with a cadaverous appearance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the countenance, &s;ucceeded by a deep yel|low or leaden colour of the &s;kin and nails; the eyes become &s;uffu&s;ed with blood, and the countenance appears like that of one &s;trangled; but no &s;igns of jaundice appear, either in the urine or feces. In &s;ome ca&s;es, a profu&s;e di&s;charge of blood from the no&s;e, concludes the cata&s;trophe. A hiccup is a very frequent but not a con&s;tant &s;ymptom, nor does vomiting always occur. The tongue is &s;eldom very foul or dry, nor does the patient always crave drink. His intel|lects, though always confu&s;ed, are &s;eldom &s;o much di&s;ordered as to amount to a deli|rium. Sub&s;ultus tendinum are very rare</P>
<P>When the di&s;ea&s;e terminates favourably,
<PB N="12" REF="025075_0012_0FCE4B3EAAF56FC0">
the &s;ymptoms generally abate on the third or fourth day, accompanied by a profu&s;e &s;weat. When it ends fatally, it is general|ly between the fifth and eighth day, though &s;ome have &s;urvived the tenth and died af|terwards.</P>
<P>The characteri&s;tic or leading &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e, as has already been ob&s;er|ved, are &s;udden debility in the voluntary powers, oppre&s;&s;ive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ain, giddine&s;s and &s;en&s;e of fulne&s;s and di&s;tention in the ve&s;&s;els of the forepart of the head, and an oppre&s;&s;ive weight, or an inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;en&s;ation of tightne&s;s about the heart and lungs, accom|panied with excruciating angui&s;h and re&s;t|le&s;&s;ne&s;s."</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the contagion had reached the central &s;treets, it &s;pread it&s;elf with dreadful rapidity on all &s;ides. In the cour&s;e of Au|gu&s;t there were more than three hundred funerals; towards the clo&s;e of the month there were twenty buried in a day. Dur|ing the major part of the time the thermo|ter &s;tood from 80 to 90 in the afternoons; the &s;ky was mo&s;tly fair, and the winds ge|nerally we&s;terly. From the 25th. to the

end of the month the weather was cloudy and &s;ome rain fell; during the&s;e days the mortallity encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>In September its malignance increa&s;ed amazingly: fear impre&s;&s;ed the &s;toute&s;t hearts; the dread of infection increa&s;ed with the the infection it&s;elf. Many peo|ple declined vi&s;iting their neare&s;t relatives that were &s;ick. The mo&s;t humane &s;eemed to have forgotten their humanity. The utmo&s;t &s;kill in the healing art was employed in vain. Every family &s;eemed to hug it&s;elf in a &s;tate of &s;eclu&s;ion from its neare&s;t neighbour. Indeed in &s;ome few &s;orrowful in&s;tances, all the warm "charities of father, &s;on and brother," were pal&s;ied by the cold hand of death.</P>
<P>At this cri&s;is, a cri&s;is of inconceivable con&s;ternation, many thou&s;ands flew into the country, as choice or chance directed; and in our own &s;tate they generally met with a &s;ympathetic reception; the farmer opened his ho&s;pitable doors to receive the affrighted fugitives, and condoled in their &s;ufferings. A few there were who allowed

their fears to overpower their fellow-feel|ing, and refu&s;ed their aid unle&s;s paid an extraordinary price. In this month four|teen hundred citizens were added to the li&s;t of mortality. The contagion was &s;till progre&s;&s;ive; towards the end of it there were from fifty to ninety buried in a day. By the gla&s;&s;es the heat of the atmo&s;phere had abated; the mercury &s;eldom ro&s;e above 80. The weather was mo&s;tly fair, with a few intervening days of cloud, which promi&s;ed rain but di&s;charged none. The winds &s;till continued to be we&s;terly. From the 19th to the 23d the air was calm; and during the&s;e five days and the day following there were near five hundred per&s;ons buri|ed. Throughout the month the heat was generally moderate, and the weather pret|ty equable; &s;o that the increa&s;e of the mortality was owing merely to the enlarge|ment of the circle of infection.</P>
<P>Until the middle of October the mighty de&s;troyer went on with increa&s;ing havoc. From the 1&s;t. to the 17th upwards of four|teen hundred fell as victims to the tremen|dous malady: from the latter day to the 31&s;t. the bills of mortality le&s;&s;oned pretty

gradually. In the whole of this month the dead amounted to near two thou&s;and; a dreadful number! if we con&s;ider that at this time upwards of one third of its inhabitants had for&s;aken the city.</P>
<P>People by this time had experienced the inefficacy of &s;melling bottles, handkerchiefs dipped in vinegar, camphor bags pieces of tarred rope, &amp;c. as a prevention; and had very generally laid them a&s;ide; tru&s;ting rather to the protection of Providence, and a prudent care to avoid the hou&s;es of the &s;ick. In the earlier period of the di&s;ea&s;e the&s;e precautions were almo&s;t univer&s;al; in&s;omuch that the greater part of the peo|ple to be &s;een in the &s;treets, had either one or the other applied to their no&s;trils. Many pla|ced an extraordinary confidence in the vir|tue of garlic and chewed it con&s;tantly, even to &s;uch a degree as to be &s;melled at &s;eve|veral yards di&s;tance. Samuel Benge, who had that dangerous office, the &s;uperintend|ance of the removal of the &s;ick from their hou&s;es to Bu&s;h-hill, u&s;ed to take a few An|der&s;on's pills, and a little &s;weet-oil every evening: whether this was the cau&s;e of his

e&s;caping the di&s;ea&s;e, cannot be a&s;certained.</P>
<P>The thermometer was very variable, mo&s;t|ly below 80, and above 50 until the 27th, from which day to the end of the month it was al|ways below 50, and one day below 40. The winds generally blew from the N. and N. W. The weather for the greate&s;t part of the time fair. During the five or &s;ix la&s;t days of this month the virulence of the contagion was greatly abated; but few fre&s;h patients pre|&s;ented them&s;elves&mdash;and the funerals were from 12 to 20 per diem.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t of November to the &s;eventh, the mortality continued gradually to de|crea&s;e; on the ninth, the burials in all the grave-yards were reduced to &s;o &s;mall a num|ber as &s;ix. By this time the fugitive citizens had recovered their &s;pirits &s;ufficiently to venture back to their homes; the &s;treets and the various departments of bu&s;ine&s;s began to re&s;ume life and activity.</P>
<P>Let us now make a pau&s;e; a &s;olemn pau&s;e! The vi&s;itation has pa&s;&s;ed over our heads for a time at lea&s;t. Let us look back on the awful &s;cene; and endeavour to draw

<P>A contagious fever hath made dreadful, and in this country unparallelled, ravages in every quarter of the city; few hou&s;es in|deed have e&s;caped. Univer&s;al con&s;ternati|on invaded every mind: the feelings of hu|manity; the &s;ugge&s;tions of duty; the for|titude of man, have all been ab&s;orbed by the &s;en&s;e of private danger, and a wi&s;h to e&s;cape the infectious calamity: every me|dical aid hath been exerted; and in mo&s;t ca&s;es exerted in vain! The potent malady hath laughed to &s;corn our wi&s;dom, and our ingenuity.

<P>With this humble temper of mind he will be better prepared to receive the benefits of Heaven with gratitude; he can never fail to feel a glow of devotion, when he con&s;id|ers that all human &s;kill had been exhau&s;ted in mo&s;t ca&s;es to no good purpo&s;e; and the gloom which hung over the city &s;eemed to threaten to unpeople it, the forgivene&s;s and and mercy of the MOST HIGH, bur&s;t out, like the brightne&s;s of the &s;un through a cloud, with healing virtue. Mercy rea&s;u|med the a&s;cendant on the judgment &s;eat; and the raging mortallity cea&s;ed. Let us then with one accord lift up our hearts with our hands to God in the Heavens, and pray, that he may animate our minds with a re&s;o|lution to profit by the late humiliating di&s;|play of his judgment and his mercy.</P>

that reflects much credit on the neghbouring country people is that our markets were to|lerably well &s;upplied with every nece&s;&s;ary of life, u&s;ually to be found in them; and that at no con&s;iderable advance in the price.</P>
<P>Although the predominant feature of the city while the mortality raged at the ex|treme, was terror and di&s;may; and altho' mo&s;t people &s;ought their own &s;afety with too little concern about others; there were found men, who, at the imminent ri&s;que of their own lives, &s;tept forward, at the mo&s;t trying pinch, to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who wanted the choice or the means of flying.

<P>The country &s;eat of William Hamilton at Bu&s;h-hill being an high and airy &s;ituation&punc; and at &s;ome di&s;tance from the city, was ta|ken and converted into an ho&s;pital for the poor, and &s;uch as had not conveniencies of being nur&s;ed at their own homes.

Clean|line&s;s was neglected to &s;uch a degree that the chambers became too offen&s;ive and danger|ous for any but an in&s;en&s;ible, or an he|roic mind to enter. In this &s;tate of di&s;order and filthine&s;s; it will be naturally &s;uppo&s;ed, the &s;ick had little chance of recovering: and indeed &s;o few did recover, that the minds of the poor, who to this time had e&s;ca|ped the infection, in&s;tead of con&s;idering the ho&s;pital as a ble&s;&s;ing, became terrified with the thoughts of being &s;ent to it, and many, even of the &s;ick, re&s;i&s;ted as long they were able, the importunities of their friends to have them taken to inevitable death as it appeared to them to be.</P>
<P>A Committee of citizens (a li&s;t of who&s;e names is hereunto annexed) who had under|taken to a&s;&s;ist the ordinary and legal guar|dians of the poor, heard repeated com|plaints of this alarming evil: but the ha|zard of attending at the ho&s;pital to remove it, as well as prevent the repetition of it when removed, &s;eemed like an immediate &s;acrafice of the lives of the undertakers.

<P>So great a mortality among the people con&s;equently left a large number of or|phan children in a very de&s;titute and di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing &s;ituation; &s;ome of them without a friend to admini&s;ter to their wants; &s;eve|ral of them indeed, were found wandering in the &s;treets, not knowing where to apply for relief. Here again was a large field of labour opened for the benevolent. The chil|dren were to be provided with nur&s;es pro|vi&s;ions
<PB N="25" REF="025075_0025_0FCE4B7765DF1D38">
and other accommodations, which was no &s;mall undertaking. The committee however in addition to their former bur|dens, al&s;o undertook this; and procured the Loganian Library which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ed up, and appropriated to the purpo&s;e of an Orphan hou&s;e. A &s;uitable woman hath been provided as &s;uperintendant, with &s;ufficient a&s;&s;i&s;tants under her. Every nece&s;&s;ary care appears to have been taken and the children mo&s;tly healthy and chearful. Many of the&s;e have been delivered to their relatives. About two hundred have been introduced into this hou&s;e of whom about &s;ixty were infants. At pre&s;ent there are nearly fifty in the hou&s;e and between thirty and forty out with wet nur&s;es.

<P>The accumulating expence of this in|&s;titution as well as that at Bu&s;h-hill, with many others, obliged the committee to ne|gociate a loan of 1500 dollars with the bank of North America, and this being ina|diquate to the expence, they borrowed a farther &s;um of 5000 dollars of the &s;ame bank, for which the directors refu&s;ed to re|cieve any intere&s;t. Several liberal contri|butions have enabled the committee to con|tinue

<P>Notwith&s;tanding &s;o generous as were the &s;upplies handed us by our friendly coun|trymen, &s;o great was the terror and di&s;may with which they were affected at the idea of the fugitive Philadelphians carrying the di&s;order with them and &s;preading it in the country, that the great law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation &s;uper&s;eded every other con&s;i|deration; in&s;omuch that in many places re&s;olutions were entered into, that no per|&s;on

The inhabitants of the town of Bo&s;ton, New York, Baltimore, Charle&s;ton, and mo&s;t other &s;ea-ports in the United States, made re&s;olutions &s;imilar to the above and obliged all ve&s;&s;els coming from Phila|delphia, to ride quarantine for the &s;pace of time which they re&s;pectively apprehended requi&s;ite to a&s;&s;ertain whether there was any thing of the contagion among them.

<P>It is remarkable that the French who &s;et|tled among us, and particularly tho&s;e from the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, were in a particular manner pre&s;erved from this &s;ickne&s;s: &s;ome few, however, took it and died.</P>

<P>Though the conduct of &s;ome of them, in taking three and four dollars a day; ex|acting it with the utmo&s;t rigor from &s;tarving families, and then not doing their duty, is to be reprobated, and for that of others an ex|cu&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary, yet there are &s;ome among them who&s;e conduct merits great applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are acquainted with human na|ture, will readily allow that the principle of &s;elf pre&s;ervation, mu&s;t operate upon the blacks as &s;trongly as upon other people. Now tho' experience has &s;hewn that the former have almo&s;t univer&s;ally e&s;caped the contagion, yet at that time the fact was not ab&s;olutely e&s;tabli&s;hed, and they might rati|onally be &s;uppo&s;ed to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the idea that the circulating report of their being incapable of taking the infection, was but a fine&s;&s;e or &s;tratagem of the whites, to fa|cilitate the attainment of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and as they were ignorant of the phy&s;ical

properties of bodies, and as even we, with all the advantages of education, have not yet been able to develope the cau&s;e of their wonderful pre&s;ervation, the idea, which they may have had of the danger, would very probably prevent many from underta|king &s;o difficult and hazardous an employ|ment. Is it not human nature? Would it not have been almo&s;t a phenomenon, had they, educated as they are, acted otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>As the value of labour is generally e&s;ti|mated by the trouble it co&s;ts, or the danger which attends it, and the plenty or &s;carcity of hands that are willing to undertake an employment, the blacks would naturally follow the general principle and take ad|vantage of the time, to get as much for their labour as they could. I mean not to ju&s;tify the exaction of exorbitant prices at &s;uch a time, but merely to offer a &s;mall ex|tenuation of a fault which the negroes were unfortunately guilty of. It &s;hould be con|&s;idered that their education has been &s;uch as to keep them in ignorance of the finer feel|ings of nature, that they have generally been in the habit of being impo&s;ed upon, that they are univer&s;ally poor, and mu&s;t

<P>THE fever at that period was circum&s;cri|bed between Pine-&s;treet northerly, and three or four &s;quares from thence &s;outherly, and extended from Water-&s;treet, to Third or Fourth-&s;treet we&s;terly.

There was al&s;o a kind of cardial|gia, or burning heat about the &s;crobiculus cordis, with great oppre&s;&s;ion; but if I re|member right, not much pain like a cholic; nor do I recollect any chill generally prece|ding the above &s;ymtoms&mdash;however, it might be with &s;ome.

The pul&s;e was not generally either full or ten&s;e, but very quick in the beginning, by which the degree of fe|ver was chiefly de&s;ignated.

<HEAD>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE PLAGUE IN LONDON, 1665.</HEAD>
<HEAD>(Written at that time.)</HEAD>
<P>AMONGST the many calamities with which the Almighty is plea&s;ed to vi&s;it the children of men, in order to reduce them to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their own weakne&s;s and entire dependance upon him, there is &s;carce any that are more productice of true pe|nitent humiliation and of a &s;ight of what is really good and truly evil, than tho&s;e contagious di&s;tem|pers, which an offended God &s;ometimes &s;uffers to rage among&s;t the people. In the year 1665 the city of London was &s;orely vi&s;ited by the plague. An account of the progre&s;s and effects of that vi&s;it|ation was kept by a citizen who remained there during the whole time of the &s;ickne&s;s, and appears to have been candid and judicious in his remarks thereon. I tru&s;t my readers may, in a &s;hort de|&s;cription of that memorable judgment, meet with &s;uch le&s;&s;ons of be&s;t wi&s;dom, which nothing can &s;o effectually produce, as a clo&s;e and &s;erious conver&s;e with death and the grave. The introduction of this contagion in London was by &s;ome goods im|ported from Holland, which had been brought thi|ther from the Levant. It fir&s;t broke out in the hou&s;e where tho&s;e goods were opened, from whence it &s;pread to other hou&s;es. In the fir&s;t hou&s;e that was infected there died four per&s;ons: A neigh|bour who went to vi&s;it them returning home,
<PB N="2" REF="025075_0038_0FCE4B55CE7683C0">
gave the di&s;temper to her family, and died with all her hou&s;hold. The pari&s;h officers who were employed about the &s;ick per&s;ons, being al&s;o infect|ed, the phy&s;icians perceived the danger, and, upon narrow in&s;pection, a&s;&s;ured, that it was indeed the plague, with all its terrifying particulars, and that it threatened a general infection. The people began now to be alarmed all over the town: the u&s;ual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week were generally about 240 to 300, but from the 17th to the 24th of Jan. the printed bill was 474. However this went off again, and the fro&s;t continuing very &s;evere till nearly the end of February, the bills decrea&s;ed again, and people began to look upon the danger as good as over; but in May the bills greatly increa&s;ed, and the weather becoming hot, the infection &s;pread again in a dreadful manner.</P>
<P>I lived, &s;ays the author, without Aldgate, and as the di&s;temper had not reached to that &s;ide of the city, our neighbourhood continued ea&s;y; but at the other end of the town the con&s;ternation was very great, and the nobility and gentry thronged out of the town with their families in an unu&s;ual manner; nothing was to be &s;een but waggons, carts, and coaches, with goods and people, and hor&s;e-men attending them, hurrying away; then empty waggons and carts appeared, who were apparently returning to fetch more people, be&s;ides innumerable numbers of people on hor&s;e back, fitted out for travelling. This was a very melancholy pro&s;pect; indeed there was nothing el&s;e of moment to be &s;een; it filled my mind with very &s;erious thoughts of the mi&s;ery that was coming upon the city, and the unhappy condition of tho&s;e that would be left in it. By the end of July the contagion had &s;pread and in|crea&s;ed to a great degree: Sorrow and &s;adne&s;s
<PB N="3" REF="025075_0039_0FCE4B82E2790AF0">
&s;at upon every face; and though &s;ome parts were not yet overwhelmed, all looked deeply concern|ed. London might well be &s;aid to be all in tears, the mourners did not go about the &s;treets, for no|body made a formal dre&s;s of mourning for their neare&s;t relations, but the voice of mourning was indeed heard in the &s;treets; the &s;hrieks of women and children at the windows and doors of their hou&s;es where their deare&s;t relations were dying, were &s;o frequent to be heard as we pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treets, that it was enough to pierce the &s;toute&s;t heart in the world. Tears and lamentations were &s;een al|mo&s;t in every hou&s;e, e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t part of the vi&s;itation; for towards the latter end people did not &s;o much concern them&s;elves for the lo&s;s of their friends, expecting that them&s;elves &s;hould be &s;ummoned the next hour.</P>
<P>It was a time of very unhappy breaches among&s;t us; in matters of religion, divi&s;ions and &s;eparate opinions prevailed; the church of England was lately re&s;tored, and the Pre&s;byterians and other profe&s;&s;ions had &s;et up their meetings for wor&s;hip, apart, in which they were frequently di&s;turbed, the government endeavouring to &s;uppre&s;s their meetings. But this dreadful vi&s;itation reconciled the different parties, and took all manner of prejudice and &s;cruple from the people. But after the &s;ickne&s;s was over, that &s;pirit of charity &s;ub&s;i|ded, and things returned to their own channel again. Here we may ob&s;erve, that a nearer view of death would &s;oon reconcile men of good prin|ciples to one another, and that it is chiefly owing to our ea&s;y &s;ituations in life, and our putting the&s;e things far from us, that our breaches are fomented, and that there is &s;o much prejudice and want of Chri&s;tian charity and union among&s;t us. A clo&s;e view and conver&s;e with death, or with di&s;|ea&s;es that threaten death, would &s;cum off the
<PB N="4" REF="025075_0040_0FCE4B5724424D88">
gall of our temper, remove our animo&s;ities, and bring us to &s;ee with different eyes. On the other &s;ide of the grave we &s;hall all be brethren again.</P>
<P>The inns of court were now all &s;hut up, there was few lawyers to be &s;een in the city, indeed there was no need of them, for quarrels and divi&s;ions about intere&s;t had cea&s;ed; every body was at peace.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o worthy of ob&s;ervation, as well as fruitful of in&s;truction, to ob&s;erve with what ala|crity the people of all per&s;ua&s;ions embraced the opportunities they had of attending upon the public wor&s;hip, and other appointed times of de|votion, as humiliations, fa&s;tings and public con|fe&s;&s;ions of &s;ins, to implore the mercy of GOD, and avert the judgment which hung over their heads. The churches were &s;o thronged, that there was often no coming near, no, not to the very door of the large&s;t churches. There was al&s;o daily prayers appointed morning and even|ing, at which the people attended with uncommon devotion.</P>
<P>All plays and interludes which had lately be|gan to increa&s;e among&s;t us, were forbidden; the gaming tables, publick dancing-rooms and mu&s;ick-hou&s;es, which multiplied and began to de|bauch the manners of the people, were &s;hut up and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, finding indeed no trade, for the minds of the people were generally humbled and agitated with other things, death was before their eyes, and every body began to think of their grave.</P>
<P>The infection &s;till gradually increa&s;ed till the middle of Augu&s;t when there died a thou&s;and a day, by account of the weekly bills, though they never gave a full account by many thou&s;ands; many of the pari&s;h officers were taken &s;ick them|&s;elves and died when their account was to be given in. The pari&s;h of Stepney alone had with|in
<PB N="5" REF="025075_0041_0FCE4B84EDEC87E0">
in the year one hundred and &s;ixteen &s;extons, grave-diggers and carriers of the dead, &amp;c. In|deed the work was not of a nature to allow them lei&s;ure to take an exact tale of the dead bodies, which were all thrown together in the dark in a pit, to which no man could come near without the utmo&s;t peril.</P>
<P>I had &s;ays the author, the care of my brother's hou&s;e which obliged me &s;ometimes to go abroad. In the&s;e walks I had di&s;mal &s;cenes before my eyes, as particularly of per&s;ons falling dead in the &s;treets, terrible &s;hrieks of women, who in their agonies would throw open their chamber-windows, and cry out in a di&s;mal &s;urpri&s;ing manner; it is impo&s;|&s;ible to de&s;cribe the variety of po&s;tures in which the pa&s;&s;ions of the poor people would expre&s;s them|&s;elves. Pa&s;&s;ing through Token Hou&s;e yard, of a &s;udden a ca&s;ement violently opened ju&s;t over my head and a woman gave three frightful &s;hrikes, and then cry'd: <HI>Oh! Death Death Death,</HI> which &s;truck me with horror and chillne&s;s in my very blood, there was nobody to be &s;een in the whole &s;treet, neither did any window open, for people now had no curio&s;ity in any ca&s;e. I went on to pa&s;s into Bell-Alley, where there was a greater cry than that; I could hear women and children run &s;kreaming about the rooms like di&s;tracted, when a garret window opened, and &s;omebody on the other &s;ide a&s;ked <HI>What is the matter?</HI> Upon which it was an&s;wered, <HI>Oh Lord! my old ma&s;ter has hang|ed him&s;elf.</HI> The other a&s;ked again, <HI>Is he quite dead?</HI> And the fir&s;t an&s;wered, <HI>Ay ay quite dead and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> This Per&s;on was a Deputy-Alderman and very rich, But this is but one in&s;tance, it is &s;carce credible what dreadful ca&s;es happened in particular fami|lies every day. People in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the di&s;tem|per or in the torment of the &s;welling, which was indeed intolerable, becoming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">,
<PB N="6" REF="025075_0042_0FCE4B5A23256020">
oftentimes laid violent hands upon them&s;elves throwing them&s;elves out of the windows, or breaking out of the hou&s;es, would dance naked about the &s;treets, not knowing one extacy from another; others if not prevented, would run di|rectly down the river, and plunge into the water. Some dying of mere grief as a pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;ome of fright and &s;urpri&s;e, without having recieved the infection. It often pierced my very &s;oul, to hear the groans and cries of tho&s;e thus tormented; but this of the &s;wellings was accounted the mo&s;t promi&s;ing particular in the whole infection; for if the&s;e &s;wellings could be brought to break and run, the patient generally recovered. Whereas tho&s;e who were &s;truck with death at the beginning of the di&s;temper, and had &s;pots come upon them, often went about indifferent ea&s;y, till a little before they died, and &s;ome till the moment they dropt down; &s;ome would be taken very &s;uddenly &s;ick, and would run to a convenient place, or their own hou&s;es if po&s;&s;ible, and there &s;it down, grow faint, and die. The method the magi&s;trates fell into of locking up the doors of the people's hou&s;es where they had taken the di&s;temper, &s;etting watchmen there night and day to prevent any going out to &s;pread the infection, looked hard and cruel, as perhaps tho&s;e who were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound in the family, might have e&s;ca|ped, if they had been removed from the &s;ick? but the public good &s;eem'd to ju&s;tify &s;uch a conduct, and there was no obtaining the lea&s;t mitigation by any application to the magi&s;trates. This put the people who thought them&s;elves well, upon many &s;tratigems to get out of their confinements. Going out one morning, I heard a great outcry, which prompting my curio&s;ity, I inquired the cau&s;e of a per&s;on who locked out of a window. A watchman had been employed to watch at the door of a hou&s;e, which was infected and &s;hut up, both him&s;elf and the day-watchman attended there
<PB N="7" REF="025075_0043_0FCE4B865E048260">
a day and two nights, all this while no noi&s;e had been heard, nor lights &s;een in the hou&s;e, neither had they called for any thing: it &s;eems that two or three days before the dead cart had &s;topt there, and a &s;ervant maid had been brought down to the door, dead, wrapt only in a green rug, which the buriers had put into the cart, and carried away. The next day the watchman heard great crying and &s;creaming in the hou&s;e, which he &s;uppo&s;ed was occa&s;ioned by &s;ome of the family dying ju&s;t at that time; upon which he knocked at the door a great while, at la&s;t one looked out, and &s;aid with an an|gry quick tone, and a voice of one that was cry|ing, <HI>What d'ye want that ye make &s;uch a knocking?</HI> He an&s;wered: <HI>I am the watchman: how do you do? what is the matter?</HI> The per&s;on an&s;wered: <HI>What is that to you? Stop the dead cart.</HI> This was about one o'clock; &s;oon after the &s;topt the dead cart, and then knock'd again, but nobody an&s;wer|ed. He continued knocking, and the bellman called &s;everal times: <HI>Bring out your dead;</HI> but nobody an&s;wered, till the man that drove the cart being called to other hou&s;es, would &s;tay no longer, but drove away. In the morning when the day-watchman came in, they knocked at the door a great while, but nobody an&s;wering, they got a ladder, and one of them went up to the window, and &s;aw a woman lying dead upon the floor in a di&s;mal manner: but tho' he called aloud and knocked hard on the floor with his &s;taff, nobody &s;tirred or an&s;wered.</P>
<P>This they made known to the magi&s;trate, who ordered the hou&s;e to be broken open, when nobo|dy was found in the hou&s;e, but that young woman, who having been infected, and pa&s;t recovery, the re&s;t had left her to die by her&s;elf, and were every one gone, having found &s;ome way to delude the watchman, and go out. As to tho&s;e cries and &s;hrieks which he heard, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, they were the
<PB N="8" REF="025075_0044_0FCE4B5BADB64158">
pa&s;&s;ionate cries of the family, at the bitter part|ing, which, to be &s;ure, it was to them all; this being the &s;i&s;ter to the mi&s;tre&s;s of the family. Many more in&s;tances might be given, but the&s;e may &s;uf|fice to &s;hew the deep di&s;tre&s;s of that day. Death did not now hover over every one's head only, but looked into their hou&s;es and chambers, and even &s;tared in their very faces; and though there was &s;ome &s;tupidity and dulne&s;s of mind, yet there was a great deal of ju&s;t alarm &s;ounded in the inmo&s;t &s;oul: many con&s;ciences were awakened; many hard hearts melted into tears; many a penitent confe&s;&s;ion was made of crimes long concealed. Peo|ple might be heard even in the &s;treets as we pa&s;&s;ed along calling upon God for mercy, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;aying: I have been a thief; I have been an adulterer; I have been a murderer, and the like, and none dur&s;t &s;top to make enquiry into &s;uch things, or to admini&s;ter comfort to the poor creature, who in the angui&s;h both of &s;oul and body thus cried out. Many were the warnings that were then given by dying penitents to others, not to put off and delay their repentance to a day of di&s;tre&s;s, that &s;uch a time of calamity as this, was no time for repentance. I wi&s;h, &s;ays the author, I could repeat the very &s;ound of tho&s;e groans and exclamations that I heard from &s;ome poor dying creatures, when in the height of their agonies and di&s;tre&s;s, and that I could make him that reads this hear, as, I imagine, I now hear them, for the &s;ound &s;eems &s;till to ring in my ears.</P>
<P>In the beginning of September the number of bu|rials increa&s;ing, the church-wardens of Aldgate pari&s;h ordered a large pit to be dug, to hold all the dead which might die in a month, it was about forty feet long and &s;ixteen broad; &s;ome blamed the church-wardens for &s;uffering &s;uch a frightful gulf to be dug: neverthele&s;s in two weeks they had thrown more than eleven hundred bodies into
<PB N="9" REF="025075_0045_0FCE4B87F605C5E0">
it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> when they were obliged to fill it up, as the bodies were come within 6 feet of the &s;urface. My curio&s;ity drove me to go and &s;ee this pit, when there had been near four hundred people buried in it. I got admittance into the church-yard, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ns of the &s;exton, who was a &s;en&s;ible, religious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

There was nobody, as I could perceive, at fir&s;t with the cart but the buri|ers, and the man that led the cart; but when they came to the pit, I &s;aw a man muffled in a cloak who appeared in great agony; the buriers imme|diately gathered about him, &s;uppo&s;ing he was one of tho&s;e poor delirious or de&s;perate creatures, that would &s;ometimes run to the pit, wrapt in blankets, and throw them&s;elves in, and as they &s;aid, bury them&s;elves. When the buriers came to him, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound he was neither de&s;|perate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or di&s;tempered in mind, but one oppre&s;&s;ed with a dreadful weight of grief, having his wife and &s;everal children all in the cart, that was ju&s;t come in with him, and he followed in agony and exce&s;s of &s;orrow. He calmly de&s;ired the buriers to let him alone, &s;aid he would only &s;ee the bodies thrown in, and go away; &s;o they left importun|ing him. But no &s;ooner was the cart turned round, and the bodies &s;hot into the pit promi&s;cuou&s;ly, which was a &s;urpri&s;e to him, for he at lea&s;t expect|ed,

they would have been decently laid in, though indeed he was afterwards convinced that was im|practicable, I &s;ay, no &s;ooner did he &s;ee the &s;ight, but he cryed out aloud, unable to contain him&s;elf, and fell down in a &s;woon; the buriers ran to him, and took him up, and when he came to him&s;elf, led him to a place where he was taken care of. He looked into the pit again, as he went away, but the buriers had covered the bodies &s;o immedi|ately with throwing earth, that nothing could be &s;een. The cart had in it &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen bo|dies. Some were wrapt up in linen &s;heets, &s;ome in rugs, &s;ome little other than naked, or &s;o loo&s;e, that what covering they had, fell from them, in the &s;hooting out of the cart, and they fell quite naked among the re&s;t; but the matter was not much to them, or the indecency much to any one el&s;e, &s;eeing they were to be huddled to|gether into the common grave of mankind; for here was no difference made, but poor and rich went together; there was no other way of buri|als, neither was it po&s;&s;ible there &s;hould.</P>
<P><HI>John Hayward,</HI> under-&s;exton, that is, grave|digger and bearer of the dead, never had the di&s;temper at all, but lived about twenty years after it. His wife was employed to nur&s;e the infected people; yet &s;he her&s;elf never was in|fected. The only pre&s;ervative he u&s;ed again&s;t the infection, was holding garlick and rue in his mouth, and &s;moaking tobacco; this I had from his own mouth. His wife's remedy was wa&s;hing her head in vinegar, and &s;prinkling her head-clothes &s;o with vinegar, as to keep them always moi&s;t; and if the &s;mell of any of tho&s;e &s;he waited on was more than ordinary offen&s;ive, &s;he &s;nuffed vinegar up into her no&s;e, &s;prinkled her head-clothes and held her handkerchief wet|ted with vinegar to her mouth.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t not omit mentioning the di&s;po&s;ition of the people of that day, with
<PB N="11" REF="025075_0047_0FCE4B8AE6022210">
re&s;pect to their charity to the poor, which indeed was very large both in a public and pri|vate way. Some pious ladies were &s;o zealous in this good work, and &s;o confident in the protecti|on of Providence in the di&s;charge of this great duty, that they went about them&s;elves di&s;tribu|ting alms, and vi&s;iting the poor families that were infected, in their very hou&s;es, appointing nur&s;es and apothecaries to &s;upply them with what they wanted, thus giving their ble&s;&s;ings to the poor in &s;ub&s;tantial relief, as well as hearty prayers for them. I will not undertake to &s;ay, that none of the&s;e charitable people were &s;uffer|ed to die of the plague, but this I may &s;ay, that I never knew any of them mi&s;carried, which I mention for the encouragement of others in ca&s;e of like di&s;tre&s;s, and doubtle&s;s, if they <HI>that give to the poor, lend to the Lord, and he will repay it,</HI> tho&s;e that hazard their lives to give to the poor, and to comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in &s;uch a mi&s;ery as this, may hope to be protected therein.</P>
<P>From the middle of Augu&s;t to the middle of September the infection &s;till encrea&s;ed and &s;pread it&s;elf, with an irre&s;i&s;table fury; it was reckoned, that during that time there died no le&s;s than &s;ix|teen hundred a day, one day with another. It was then that the confu&s;ion and terror was inex|pre&s;&s;ible: the courage of the people appointed to carry away the dead, began to fail them; the vi|gilence of the magi&s;trates was now put to the ut|mo&s;t trial. At la&s;t the violence of the di&s;temper came to &s;uch a height that the people &s;at &s;till, look|ing at one another, and &s;eemed quite abandoned to de&s;pair. In a word, people began to give them|&s;elves up to a fear, that there was nothing to be expected but univer&s;al de&s;olation.</P>
<P>This de&s;pair made people bold and venturous, they were no more &s;hy of one another, as expect|ing there was now no avoiding the di&s;temper, but that all mu&s;t go, this brought them to croud into
<PB N="12" REF="025075_0048_0FCE4B5EB8E2BA98">
the churches, they inquired no more what conditi|on the people who &s;at near them, were in, but look|ing upon them&s;elves as &s;o many dead corps, they came to the churches without the lea&s;t caution and crouded together, as if their lives were of no con|&s;equence, compared to the work which they were come about: Indeed their zeal in coming, and the earne&s;tne&s;s and affectionate attention they &s;hewed to what they heard, made it manife&s;t what value people would &s;et upon the wor&s;hip of GOD, if they thought that every day they attended at the church would be their la&s;t. It was in the height of their de&s;pair, that it plea&s;ed GOD to &s;tay his hand, and &s;lacken the fury of the contagion, in a manner as &s;urpri&s;ing as that of its beginning, and which demon&s;trated it to be his own particular hand above the agency of means; nothing but omni|potent power could have done it; the contagion de&s;pi&s;ed all medicine; death raged in every cor|ner, and had it gone on as it did then, a few weeks more would have cleared the town of all its inhabitants. In that very moment when thirty thou&s;and were dead in three weeks, nay when it was reported three thou&s;and had died in one night, &amp; an hundred thou&s;and more were taken &s;ick, they well might &s;ay, <HI>I am was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">p of man,</HI> it plea&s;ed God to cau&s;e the fury of it to abate, and by his immediate hand to di&s;arm the enemy. It was wonderful! The phy&s;icians were &s;urpri&s;ed, where&s;oever they vi&s;ited, to find their patients better, and in a few days every body was recover|ing: Nor was this by any medicine found out or any new method of cure di&s;covered, but it was evidently from the &s;ecret invi&s;ible hand of him that fir&s;t &s;ent this di&s;ea&s;e, as a judgment upon us. Let the philo&s;ophers &s;earch for rea&s;ons in nature to account for it, and labour as much as they will to le&s;&s;en the debt they owe to their maker; tho&s;e phy&s;icians who had the lea&s;t &s;hare of religion in them were obliged to acknowledge, that it was all &s;upernatural.</P>
