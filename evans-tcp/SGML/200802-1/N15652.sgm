<HEAD>A PLAN FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I proceed to &s;ugge&s;t a Plan for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of public &s;chools in Penn&s;ylvania, I &s;hall point out, in a few words, the influence and advantages of learning upon mankind.</P>
<P>I. It is friendly to religion, ina&s;much as it a&s;&s;i&s;ts in removing prejudice, &s;uper&s;tition and enthu&s;ia&s;m, in promoting ju&s;t notions of the Deity, and in enlarging our know|ledge of his works.</P>
<P>II. It is favourable to liberty. A free government can only exi&s;t in an equal dif|fu&s;ion of literature. Without learning men become Savages or Barbarians, and where learning is confined to a <HI>few</HI> people, we
<PB N="4" REF="019974_0003_0FAD489E88244E08">
always find monarchy, ari&s;tocracy and &s;la|very.</P>
<P>III. It promotes ju&s;t ideas of laws and go|vernment. "When the clouds of ignorance are di&s;pelled (&s;ays the Marquis of Beccaria) by the radiance of knowledge, power trem|bles, but the authority of laws remains im|moveable."</P>
<P>IV. It is friendly to manners. Learning, in all countries, promotes civilization, and the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>V. It promotes agriculture, the great ba|&s;is of national wealth and happine&s;s. Agri|culture is as much a &s;cience as hydraulics, or optics, and has been equally indebted to the experiments and re&s;earches of learned men. The highly cultivated &s;tate, and the immen&s;e profits of the farms in England, are derived wholly from the patronage which agricul|ture has received in that country, from learn|ed men and learned &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>VI. Manufactures of all kinds owe their perfection, chiefly to learning&mdash;hence the nations of Europe advance in manufactures and commerce, only in proportion as they cultivate the arts and &s;ciences.</P>
<P>For the purpo&s;e of diffu&s;ing knowledge through every part of the &s;tate, I beg leave to propo&s;e the following &s;imple plan.</P>
<P>I. Let there be one univer&s;ity in the &s;tate, and let this be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the capital.
<PB N="5" REF="019974_0004_0FAD489F5CBBD9A8">
Let law, phy&s;ic, divinty, the law of nature and nations, oeconomy, &amp;c. be taught in it by public lectures in the winter &s;ea&s;on, after the manner of the European univer&s;ities, and let the profe&s;&s;ors receive &s;uch &s;alaries from the &s;tate as will enable them to deliver their lectures at a moderate price.</P>
<P>II. Let there be four colleges. One in Philadelphia,&mdash;one at Carli&s;le&mdash;a third, for the benefit of our German fellow citizens, at Manheim,&mdash;and a fourth, &s;ome years hence, at Pitt&s;burgh. In the&s;e colleges, let young men be in&s;tructed in mathematics and in the higher branches of &s;cience, in the &s;ame manner that they are now taught in our American colleges. After they have taken a degree in one of the&s;e colleges, let them, if they can afford it, complete their &s;tudies by &s;pending a &s;ea&s;on or two in attending the lectures in the univer&s;ity. I prefer four col|leges in the &s;tate to one or two, for there is a certain &s;ize of colleges as there is of towns and armies, that is mo&s;t favourable to morals and good government. Oxford and Cambridge in England are the &s;eats of di&s;&s;i|pation&punc; while the more numerous, and le&s;s crouded univer&s;ities and colleges in Scotland, are remarkable for the order, diligence, and decent behaviour of their &s;tudents.</P>
<P>III. Let there be an academy e&s;tabli&s;hed in each county, for the purpo&s;e of in&s;truct|ing
<PB N="6" REF="019974_0005_0FAD48A00E139788">
learned youth in the languages, and thereby preparing them to enter college.</P>
<P>IV. Let there be free &s;chools e&s;tabli&s;hed in every town&s;hip, or in di&s;tricts con&s;i&s;ting of one hundred families. In the&s;e &s;chools, let children be taught to read and write the Engli&s;h and German languages, and the u&s;e of figures. Such of them as have parents that can afford to &s;end them from home, and are di&s;po&s;ed to extend their educations, may remove their children from the free &s;chool to the county academy.</P>
<P>By this plan, the whole &s;tate will be tied together by one &s;y&s;tem of education. The univer&s;ity will in time furni&s;h ma&s;ters for the colleges, and the colleges will furni&s;h ma&s;ters for the academies and free &s;chools, while the free Schools, in their turns, will &s;upply the academies&mdash;the colleges, and the uni|ver&s;ity, with &s;cholars&mdash;&s;tudents, and pupils. The &s;ame &s;y&s;tems of grammar, oratory and philo&s;ophy will be taught in every part of the &s;tate, and the literary features of Penn|&s;ylvania will thus de&s;ignate one great, and equally enlightned family.</P>
<P>A que&s;tion now ri&s;es, and that is, How &s;hall this plan be carried into execution?&mdash;I an&s;wer&mdash;</P>
<P>The funds of the univer&s;ity of Penn&s;yl|vania (if the Engli&s;h and other &s;chools were &s;eparated from it) are nearly equal to the
<PB N="7" REF="019974_0006_0FAD48A0D73BB548">
purpo&s;e of &s;upporting able profe&s;&s;ors in all the arts and &s;ciences that are taught in the European univer&s;ities.</P>
<P>A &s;mall addition to the funds of Dickin&s;on college, will enable it to exi&s;t without any further aid from government.</P>
<P>Twenty thou&s;and acres of good land in the late Indian purcha&s;e, will probably af|ford a revenue large enough to &s;upport a college at Manheim, and another on the banks of the Ohio, in the cour&s;e of twenty years.</P>
<P>Five thou&s;and acres of land, appropriated to each county academy, will probably af|ford a revenue &s;ufficient to &s;upport them in twenty years. In the mean while let a tax from &pound;200 to &pound;400 a year be laid on each county for that purpo&s;e, according to the number and wealth of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>Let &s;ixty thou&s;and acres of land be &s;et apart, to be divided, twenty years hence, among the free &s;chools. In the mean while let a tax from &pound;30 to &pound;60 a year be levied upon each di&s;trict of one hundred families, for the &s;upport of the &s;choolma&s;ter, and to prompt him to indu&s;try in encrea&s;ing his &s;chool, let each &s;cholar pay him from 1<HI>&s;</HI>6 to 2<HI>&s;</HI>6 every quarter.</P>
<P>But, how &s;hall we bear the expence of the&s;e literary in&s;titutions under the pre&s;ent weight of our taxes?&mdash;I an&s;wer&mdash;The&s;e in|&s;titutions
<PB N="8" REF="019974_0007_0FAD48A185186D98">
are de&s;igned to <HI>le&s;&s;en</HI> our taxes. They will enlighten us in the great bu&s;ine&s;s of finance&mdash;they will teach us to encrea&s;e the ability of the &s;tate to &s;upport govern|ment, by encrea&s;ing the profits of agricul|ture, and by promoting manufactures. They will teach us all the modern improvements and advantages of inland navigation. They will defend us from ha&s;ty and expen&s;ive ex|periments in government, by unfolding to us the experience and folly of pa&s;t ages, and thus, in&s;tead of adding to our taxes and debts, they will furni&s;h us with the true &s;ecret of le&s;&s;ening and di&s;charging both of them.</P>
<P>But, &s;hall the e&s;tates of orphans, batche|lors and per&s;ons who have no children be taxed to pay for the &s;upport of &s;chools from which they can derive no benefit? I an&s;wer in the affirmative, to the fir&s;t part of the ob|jection, and I deny the truth of the latter part of it. Every member of the community is intere&s;ted in the propagation of virtue and knowledge in the &s;tate. But I will go fur|ther, and add, it will be true oeconomy in individuals to &s;upport public &s;chools. The batchelor will in time &s;ave his tax for this purpo&s;e, by being able to &s;leep with fewer bolts and locks to his doors,&mdash;the e&s;tates of orphans will in time be benefited, by being protected from the ravages of unprincipled and idle boys, and the children of wealthy pa|rents
<PB N="9" REF="019974_0008_0FAD48A2433146A8">
will be le&s;s tempted, by bad company, to extravagance. Fewer pillories and whipping po&s;ts, and &s;maller jails, with their u&s;ual ex|pences and taxes, will be nece&s;&s;ary when our youth are properly educated, than at pre&s;ent. I believe it could be proved, that the ex|pences of confining, trying and executing criminals amount every year, in mo&s;t of the counties, to more money than would be &s;uf|ficient to maintain all the &s;chools that would be nece&s;&s;ary in each county. The confe&s;&s;ions of the&s;e criminals generally &s;how us, that their vices and puni&s;hments are the fatal con&s;equences of the want of a proper edu|cation in early life.</P>
<P>I &s;ubmit the&s;e detatched hints to the con|&s;ideration of the legi&s;lature and of the citi|zens of Penn&s;ylvania. The plan for the free &s;chools is taken chiefly from the plans which have long been u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s in Scot|land, and in the Ea&s;tern &s;tates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are 600 of the&s;e &s;chools in the &s;mall &s;tate of Connecticut, which, at this time, have in them 25,000 &s;cholars. Only two natives of this &s;tate have been executed in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t 25 years. The German Lutherans in Penn&s;ylvania take uncommon pains in the education of their youth. Not one of this &s;ociety has &s;ubmitted to the ignominy of a legal puni&s;hment, of any kind, in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t 17 years.</NOTE> of Ame|rica, where the influence of learning in promoting religion, morals, manners, go|vernment,
<PB N="10" REF="019974_0009_0FAD48A304FBC990">
&amp;c. has never been exceeded in any country.</P>
<P>The manner in which the&s;e academies and &s;chools, &s;hould be &s;upported and govern|ed,&mdash;the modes of determining the charac|ters and qualifications of &s;choolma&s;ters, and the arrangement of families in each di&s;trict, &s;o that children of the &s;ame religious &s;ect and nation, may be educated as much as po&s;&s;ible together, will form a proper part of a LAW for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;chools, and therefore, does not come within the limits of this plan.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this part of the plan, by &s;ubmitting it to the wi&s;dom of the legi&s;la|ture, whether in granting charters for col|leges in future, they &s;hould not confine them to giving degrees only in the <HI>arts,</HI> e&s;pecially while they teach neither law, phy&s;ic nor di|vinity. It is a folly peculiar to our Ameri|can colleges, to confer literary honours in profe&s;&s;ions that are not taught by them, and which, if not &s;peedily checked, will render degrees &s;o cheap, that they will cea&s;e to be the honourable badges of indu&s;try and learning.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid nothing of the utility of pub|lic libraries in each college, academy and free &s;chool. Upon this &s;ubject, I &s;hall only remark, that they will tend to diffu&s;e know|ledge more generally, if the farmers and
<PB N="11" REF="019974_0010_0FAD48A4D4661B60">
trade&s;men in the neighbourhood of them, (upon paying a moderate &s;um yearly) are permitted to have acce&s;s to them.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of news papers, in a few of the mo&s;t populous county towns, will contribute very much to diffu&s;e knowledge of all kinds through the &s;tate. To accom|pli&s;h this, the means of conveying the papers &s;hould be made ea&s;y, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the legi&s;lature. The effects of a news paper, upon the &s;tate of knowledge and opinions, appear already in &s;everal of the counties be|yond the Su&s;quehannah. The pa&s;&s;ion for this u&s;eful &s;pecies of in&s;truction, is &s;trongly marked in Penn&s;ylvania, by the great en|couragement this paper has received in tho&s;e counties. In the &s;pace of eight months the number of &s;ub&s;cribers to the Carli&s;le Gazette, have amounted to above 700. Henry the IVth of France, u&s;ed to &s;ay, he hoped to live to &s;ee the time, when every pea&s;ant in his kingdom would dine on a turkey every Sundays. I have not a wi&s;h for the exten&s;ion of literature in the &s;tate, that would not be gra|tified, by living to &s;ee a weekly news paper in every farm hou&s;e in Penn&s;ylvania. Part of the effects of this univer&s;al diffu&s;ion of knowledge, would probably be, to produce turkies and poultry of all kinds on the tables of our farmers, not only on Sundays, but on every day of the week.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="019974_0011_0FAD48A544E97DF8">
By multiplying villages and county towns, we encrea&s;e the means of diffu&s;ing know|ledge. Villages are favourble to &s;chools and public wor&s;hip, and county towns, be&s;ides po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the&s;e two advantages, are favoura|ble to the propagation of political and legal information. The public officers of the county, by being obliged to maintain a con|nection with the capital of the government, often become repo&s;itories and vehicles of news and u&s;eful publications, while the judges and lawyers, who attend the courts that are held in the&s;e towns, &s;eldom fail of leaving a large portion of knowledge be|hind them.</P>

<HEAD>THOUGHTS UPON THE MODE OF EDUCATION PROPER IN A REPUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE bu&s;ine&s;s of education has acquired a new complexion by the independence of our country. The form of government we have a&s;&s;umed, has created a new cla&s;s of duties to every American. It becomes us, therefore, to examine our former habits up|on this &s;ubject, and in laying the foundati|ons for nur&s;eries of wi&s;e and good men, to adapt our modes of teaching to the peculiar form of our government.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t remark that I &s;hall make upon this &s;ubject is, that an education in our own, is to be preferred to an education in a fo|reign country. The principle of patrioti&s;m &s;tands in need of the reinforcement of <HI>pre|judice,</HI> and it is well known that our &s;trong|e&s;t prejudices in favour of our country are
<PB N="14" REF="019974_0013_0FAD48A8DD721218">
formed in the fir&s;t one and twenty years of our lives. The policy of the Lacedamoni|ans is well worthy of our imitation. When Antipater demanded fifty of their children as ho&s;tages for the fulfilment of a di&s;tant en|gagement, tho&s;e wi&s;e republicans refu&s;ed to comply with his demand, but readily offered him double the number of their adult citi|zens, who&s;e habits and prejudices could not be &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> by re&s;iding in a foreign country. Pa&s;&s;ing by, in this place, the advantages to the community from the early attachment of youth to the laws and con&s;titution of their country, I &s;hall only remark, that young men who have trodden the paths of &s;ci|ence together, or have joined in the &s;ame &s;ports, whether of &s;wimming, &s;cating, fi&s;h|ing, or hunting, generally feel, thro' life, &s;uch ties to each other, as add greatly to the obligations of mutual benevolence.</P>
<P>I conceive the education of our youth in this country to be peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary in Penn&s;ylvania, while our citizens are com|po&s;ed of the natives of &s;o many different kingdoms in Europe. Our Schools of learn|ing, by producing one general, and uni|form &s;y&s;tem of education, will render the ma&s;s of the people more homogeneous, and thereby fit them more ea&s;ily for uniform and peaceable government.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="019974_0014_0FAD48AA08566E10">
I proceed, in the next place, to enquire, what mode of education we &s;hall adopt &s;o as to &s;ecure to the &s;tate all the advantages that are to be derived from the proper in|&s;truction of youth; and here I beg leave to remark that the only foundation for a u&s;eful education in a republic is to be laid in RELIGION. Without this, there can be no virtue, and without virtue there can be no liberty, and liberty is the object and life of all republican governments.</P>
<P>Such is my veneration for every religion that reveals the attributes of the Deity, or a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, that I had rather &s;ee the opinions of Confu|cius or Mahomed inculcated upon our youth, than &s;ee them grow up wholly devoid of a &s;y&s;tem of religious principles. But the re|ligion I mean to recommend in this place, is the religion of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>It is foreign to my purpo&s;e to hint at the arguments which e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of the Chri&s;tian revelation. My only bu&s;ine&s;s is to declare, that all its doctrines and pre|cepts are calculated to promote the happi|ne&s;s of &s;ociety, and the &s;afety and well be|ing of civil government. A Chri&s;tian can|not fail of being a republican. The hi&s;tory of the creation of man, and of the relation of our &s;pecies to each other by birth, which is recorded in the Old Te&s;tament, is the be&s;t
<PB N="16" REF="019974_0015_0FAD48AAAAF39B00">
refutation that can be given to the divine right of kings, and the &s;tronge&s;t argument that can be u&s;ed in favour of the original and natural equality of all mankind. A Chri&s;tian, I &s;ay again, cannot fail of being a republican, for every precept of the Go&s;|pel inculcates tho&s;e degrees of humility, &s;elf-denial, and brotherly kindne&s;s, which are directly oppo&s;ed to the pride of monarchy and the pageantry of a court. A Chri&s;tian cannot fail of being u&s;eful to the republic, for his religion teacheth him that no man "liveth to him&s;elf." And la&s;tly, a Chri&s;tian cannot fail of being wholly inoffen&s;ive, for his religion teacheth him, in all things to do to others what he would wi&s;h, in like circum&s;tances, they &s;hould do to him.</P>
<P>I am aware that I di&s;&s;ent from one of tho&s;e paradoxical opinions with which modern times abound; that it is improper to fill the minds of youth with religious prejudices of any kind, and that they &s;hould be left to choo&s;e their own principles, after they have arrived at an age in which they are capable of judging for them&s;elves. Could we pre|&s;erve the mind in childhood and youth a perfect blank, this plan of education would have more to recommend it; but this we know to be impo&s;&s;ible. The human mind runs as naturally into principles as it does
<PB N="17" REF="019974_0016_0FAD48AB55519888">
after facts. It &s;ubmits with difficulty to tho&s;e re&s;traints or partial di&s;coveries which are impo&s;ed upon it in the infancy of rea&s;on. Hence the impatience of children to be in|formed upon all &s;ubjects that relate to the invi&s;ible world. But I beg leave to a&s;k, Why &s;hould we pur&s;ue a different plan of education with re&s;pect to religion from that which we pur&s;ue in teaching the arts and &s;ciences? Do we leave our youth to acquire &s;y&s;tems of geography, philo&s;ophy, or poli|tics, till they have arrived at an age in which they are capable of judgeing for them&s;elves? We do not. I claim no more then for reli|gion, than for the other &s;ciences, and I add further, that if our youth are di&s;po&s;ed after they are of age to think for them&s;elves, a knowledge of <HI>one</HI> &s;y&s;tem will be the be&s;t means of conducting them in a free enquiry into other &s;y&s;tems of religion, ju&s;t as an ac|quaintance with one &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy is the be&s;t introduction to the &s;tudy of all the other &s;y&s;tems in the world.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg leave upon this &s;ubject to go one &s;tep further. In order more effectually to &s;ecure to our youth the advantages of a religious education, it is nece&s;&s;ary to impo&s;e upon them the doctrines and di&s;cipline of a particular church. Man is naturally an un|governable animal, and ob&s;ervations on par|ticular &s;ocieties and countries will teach us,
<PB N="18" REF="019974_0017_0FAD48AC0CDCA9E0">
that when we add the re&s;traints of ecle&s;ia&s;ti|cal, to tho&s;e of dome&s;tic and civil govern|ment, we produce, in him, the highe&s;t de|grees of order and virtue. That fa&s;hionable liberality which refu&s;es to a&s;&s;ociate with any one &s;ect of Chri&s;tians is &s;eldom u&s;eful to it|&s;elf, or to &s;ociety, and may fitly be compar|ed to the unprofitable bravery of a &s;oldier, who wa&s;tes his valour in &s;olitary enterprizes, without the aid or effect of military a&s;&s;ocia|tions. Far be it from me to recommend the doctrines or modes of wor&s;hip of any one denomination of Chri&s;tians. I only re|commend to the per&s;ons entru&s;ted with the education of youth, to inculcate upon them a &s;trict conformity to that mode of wor&s;hip which is mo&s;t agreeable to their con&s;ciences, or the inclinations of their parents.</P>
<P>Under this head, I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed in not agreeing with tho&s;e modern writers who have oppo&s;ed the u&s;e of the Bible as a &s;chool book. The only objection I know to it is, its divi&s;ion into chapters and ver&s;es, and its improper punctuation, which render it a more difficult book to read <HI>well,</HI> than many others; but the&s;e defects may ea&s;ily be cor|rected; and the di&s;advantages of them are not to be mentioned with the immen&s;e ad|vantages of making children early, and in|timately acquainted with the means of ac|quiring happine&s;s both here and hereafter.
<PB N="19" REF="019974_0018_0FAD48AD35ACE7E0">
How great is the difference between making young people acquainted with the intere&s;ting and entertaining truths contained in the Bi|ble, and the fables of Moore and Croxall, or the doubtful hi&s;tories of antiquity! I maintain that there is no book of its &s;ize in the whole world, that contains half &s;o much u&s;eful knowledge for the government of &s;tates, or the direction of the affairs of in|dividuals as the bible. To object to the prac|tice of having it read in &s;chools, becau&s;e it tends to de&s;troy our veneration for it, is an argument that applies with equal force, again&s;t the frequency of public wor&s;hip, and all other religious exerci&s;es. The fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ions upon the mind are the mo&s;t dura|ble. They &s;urvive the wreck of the memo|ry, and exi&s;t in old age after the ideas ac|quired in middle life have been obliterated. Of how much con&s;equence then mu&s;t it be to the human mind in the evening of life, to be able to recal tho&s;e ideas which are mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to its happine&s;s; and the&s;e are to be found chiefly in the Bible. The great de|light which old people take in reading the Bible, I am per&s;uaded is derived chiefly from its hi&s;tories and precepts being <HI>a&s;&s;ociated</HI> with the events of childhood and youth, the re|collection of which forms a material part of their plea&s;ures.</P>

I do not mean to exclude books of hi&s;to|ry, poetry or even fables from our &s;chools.

<P>NEXT to the duty which young men owe to their Creator, I wi&s;h to &s;ee a SUPREME REGARD TO THEIR COUNTRY, inculcated upon them. When the Duke of Sully be|came prime mini&s;ter to Henry the IVth of France, the fir&s;t thing he did, he tells us, "Was to &s;ubdue and forget his own heart." The &s;ame duty is incumbent upon every citi|zen of a republic. Our country includes family, friends and property, and &s;hould be preferred to them all. Let our pupil be taught that he does not belong to him&s;elf, but that he is public property. Let him be taught to love his family, but let him be
<PB N="21" REF="019974_0020_0FAD48AE54D5D108">
taught, at the &s;ame time, that he mu&s;t for|&s;ake and even forget them, when the welfare of his country requires it. He mu&s;t watch for the &s;tate as if its liberties depended upon his vigilance alone, but he mu&s;t do this in &s;uch a manner as not to defraud his creditors, or neglect his family. He mu&s;t love private life, but he mu&s;t decline no &s;tation, however public or re&s;pon&s;able it may be, when called to it by the &s;uffrages of his fellow-citizens. He mu&s;t love popularity, but he mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e it when &s;et in competition with the dictates of his judgement, or the real intere&s;t of his country. He mu&s;t love character, and have a due &s;en&s;e of injuries, but he mu&s;t be taught to appeal only to the laws of the &s;tate, to de|fend the one, and puni&s;h the other. He mu&s;t love family honour, but he mu&s;t be taught that neither the rank nor antiquity of his ance&s;tors can command re&s;pect, without per&s;onal merit. He mu&s;t avoid neutrality in all que&s;tions that divide the &s;tate, but he mu&s;t &s;hun the rage, and acrimony of party &s;pirit. He mu&s;t be taught to love his fellow crea|tures in every part of the world, but he mu&s;t cheri&s;h with a more inten&s;e and peculiar af|fection, the citizens of Penn&s;ylvania and of the United States. I do not wi&s;h to &s;ee our youth educated with a &s;ingle prejudice again&s;t any nation or country; but we impo&s;e a ta&s;k upon human nature, repugnant alike to rea|&s;on,
<PB N="22" REF="019974_0021_0FAD48AF1CE92B38">
revelation and the ordinary dimen&s;ions of the human heart, when we require him to embrace, with equal affection, the whole family of mankind. He mu&s;t be taught to ama&s;s wealth, but it mu&s;t be only to encrea&s;e his power of contributing to the wants and demands of the &s;tate. He mu&s;t be indulg|ed occa&s;ionally in amu&s;ements, but he mu&s;t be taught that &s;tudy and bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be his principal pur&s;uits in life. Above all he mu&s;t love life, and endeavour to acquire as many of its conveniences as po&s;&s;ible by in|du&s;try and oeconomy, but he mu&s;t be taught that this life "Is not his own," when the &s;afety of his country requires it. The&s;e are practicable le&s;&s;ons, and the hi&s;tory of the commonwealths of Greece and Rome &s;how, that human nature, without the aids of Chri&s;tianity, has attained the&s;e degrees of perfection.</P>
<P>While we inculcate the&s;e republican duties upon our pupil, we mu&s;t not neglect, at the &s;ame time, to in&s;pire him with republican principles. He mu&s;t be taught that there can be no durable liberty but in a republic, and that government, like all other &s;ciences, is of a progre&s;&s;ive nature. The chains which have bound this &s;cience in Europe are happi|ly unloo&s;ed in America. <HI>Here</HI> it is open to inve&s;tigation and improvement. While phi|lo&s;ophy has protected us by its di&s;coveries
<PB N="23" REF="019974_0022_0FAD48AFCBCD83D0">
from a thou&s;and natural evils, government has unhappily followed with an unequal pace. It would be to di&s;honour human ge|nius only to name the many defects which &s;till exi&s;t in the be&s;t &s;y&s;tems of legi&s;lation. We daily &s;ee matter of a peri&s;hable nature rendered durable by certain chemical opera|tions. In like manner, I conceive, that it is po&s;&s;ible to analyze and combine power in &s;uch a manner as not only to encrea&s;e the happine&s;s, but to promote the duration of republican forms of government far beyond the terms limited for them by hi&s;tory, or the common opinions of mankind.</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;i&s;t in rendering religious, moral and political in&s;truction more effectual upon the minds of our youth, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ub|ject their bodies to phy&s;ical di&s;cipline. To obviate the inconveniences of their &s;tudious and &s;edantary mode of life, they &s;hould live upon a temperate diet, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of broths, milk and vegetables. The black broth of Sparta, and the barley broth of Scotland, have been alike celebrated for their beneficial effects upon the minds of young people. They &s;hould avoid ta&s;ting &s;pirituous liquors. They &s;hould al&s;o be accu&s;tomed occa&s;ionally to work with their hands, in the intervals of &s;tudy, and in the bu&s;y &s;ea&s;ons of the year in the country. Moderate &s;leep, &s;ilence, occa&s;ional &s;olitude,
<PB N="24" REF="019974_0023_0FAD48B0B036D1B8">
and cleanline&s;s, &s;hould be inculcated upon them, and the utmo&s;t advantage &s;hould be taken of a proper direction of tho&s;e great principles in human conduct,&mdash;&s;en&s;ibility, habit, imitation, and a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>The influence the&s;e phy&s;ical cau&s;es will be powerful upon the intellects, as well as upon the principles and morals of young people.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who have &s;tudied human nature, it will not appear paradoxical to recommend, in this e&s;&s;ay, a particular attention to vocal mu&s;ic. Its mechanical effects in civilizing the mind, and thereby preparing it for the influence of religion and government, have been &s;o often felt and recorded, that it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to mention facts in favour of its u&s;efulne&s;s in order to excite a proper at|tention to it.</P>
<P>In the education of youth, let the authority of our ma&s;ters be as <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> as po&s;&s;ible. The government of &s;chools like the government of private families, &s;hould be <HI>arbitary,</HI> that it may not be <HI>&s;evere.</HI> By this mode of edu|cation, we prepare our youth for the &s;ubor|dination of laws, and thereby qualify them for becoming good citizens of the republic. I am &s;atisfied that the mo&s;t u&s;eful citizens have been formed from tho&s;e youth who have never known or felt their own wills till they were one and twenty years of age, and I have often thought that &s;ociety owes a great deal
<PB N="25" REF="019974_0024_0FAD48B1644E2C98">
of its order and happine&s;s to the deficiencies of parental government, being &s;upplied by tho&s;e habits of obedience and &s;ubordination which are contracted at &s;chools.</P>
<P>I cannot help bearing a te&s;timony, in this place, again&s;t the cu&s;tom, which prevails in &s;ome parts of America, (but which is daily falling into di&s;u&s;e in Europe) of crouding boys together under one roof for the pur|po&s;e of education. The practice is the gloomy remains of monki&s;h ignorance, and is as unfavourable to the improvements of the mind in u&s;eful learning, as mona&s;teries are to the &s;pirit of religion. I grant this mode of &s;ecluding boys from the intercour&s;e of private families, has a tendency to make them &s;cholars, but our bu&s;ine&s;s is to make them men, citizens and chri&s;tians. The vices of young people are generally learned from each other. The vices of adults &s;eldom infect them. By &s;eparating them from each other, therefore, in their hours of relaxati|on from &s;tudy, we &s;ecure their morals from a principal &s;ource of corruption, while we improve their manners, by &s;ubjecting them to tho&s;e re&s;traints, which the difference of age and &s;ex, naturally produce in private families.</P>
<P>I have hitherto &s;aid nothing of the AMUSE|MENTS that are proper for young people in a republic. Tho&s;e which promote health and
<PB N="26" REF="019974_0025_0FAD48B243B7B4B8">
good humour, will have a happy effect upon morals and government. To encrea&s;e this influence, let the per&s;ons who direct the&s;e amu&s;ements, be admitted into good com|pany, and &s;ubjected, by that means, to re|&s;traints in behaviour and moral conduct. Taverns which in mo&s;t countries are expo&s;ed to riot and vice, in Connecticut are places of bu&s;ine&s;s and innocent plea&s;ure, becau&s;e the tavern-keepers in that country are generally men of &s;ober and re&s;pectable characters. The theatre will never be perfectly reformed till players are treated with the &s;ame re&s;pect as per&s;ons of other ornamental profe&s;&s;ions. It is to no purpo&s;e to attempt to write or preach down an amu&s;ement, which &s;eizes &s;o forcibly upon all the powers of the mind. Let mi|ni&s;ters preach <HI>to</HI> players, in&s;tead of <HI>again&s;t</HI> them; let them open their churches and the ordinances of religion to them and their families, and, I am per&s;uaded, we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee &s;uch a reformation in the theatre as can never be effected by all the means that have hitherto been employed for that purpo&s;e. It is po&s;&s;ible to render the &s;tage, by the&s;e means, &s;ub&s;urvient to the purpo&s;es of virtue and even religion. Why &s;hould the mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel exclude the player from his vi&s;its, or from his public or private in&s;truc|tions? The Author of Chri&s;tianity knew no difference in the occupations of men. He
<PB N="27" REF="019974_0026_0FAD48B2D274CEC8">
eat and drank daily with publicans and &s;in|ners.</P>
<P>From the ob&s;ervations that have been made it is plain, that I con&s;ider it as po&s;&s;ible to convert men into republican machines. This mu&s;t be done, if we expect them to perform their parts properly, in the great machine of the government of the &s;tate. That republic is &s;ophi&s;ticated with monarchy or ari&s;tocracy that does not revolve upon the wills of the people, and the&s;e mu&s;t be fitted to each other by means of education before they can be made to produce regularity and uni&s;on in government.</P>
<P>Having pointed out tho&s;e general princi|ples, which &s;hould be inculcated alike in all the &s;chools of the &s;tate, I proceed now to make a few remarks upon the method of conducting, what is commonly called, a li|beral or learned education in a republic.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin this part of my &s;ubject by bearing a te&s;timony again&s;t the common practice of attempting to teach boys the learned languages, and the arts and &s;ciences too early in life. The fir&s;t twelve years of life are barely &s;ufficient to in&s;truct a boy in reading, writing and arithmetic. With the&s;e, he may be taught tho&s;e modern languages which are nece&s;&s;ary for him to <HI>&s;peak.</HI> The &s;tate of the memory, in early life, is favour|able to the acqui&s;ition of languages, e&s;peci|ally
<PB N="28" REF="019974_0027_0FAD48B3852598B0">
when they are conveyed to the mind through the ear. It is, moreover, in early life only, that the organs of &s;peech yield in &s;uch a manner as to favour the ju&s;t pronoun|ciation of foreign languages.</P>
<P>I do not wi&s;h the LEARNED OR DEAD LAN|GUAGES, as they are commonly called, to be reduced below their pre&s;ent ju&s;t rank in the univer&s;ities of Europe, e&s;pecially as I con&s;ider an acquaintance with them as the be&s;t foun|dation for a correct and exten&s;ive knowledge of the language of our country. Too much pains cannot be taken to teach our youth to read and write our American language with propriety and elegance. The &s;tudy of the Greek language con&s;tituted a material part of the literature of the Athenians, hence the &s;ublimity, purity and immortality of &s;o many of their writings. The advantages of a perfect knowledge of our language to young men intended for the profe&s;&s;ions of law, phy&s;ic or divinity are too obvious to be mentioned, but in a &s;tate which boa&s;ts of the fir&s;t commercial city in America, I wi&s;h to &s;ee it cultivated by young men, who are intended for the compting hou&s;e, for many &s;uch, I hope, will be educated in our col|leges. The time is pa&s;t when an academical education was thought to be unnece&s;&s;ary to qualify a young man for merchandize. I
<PB N="29" REF="019974_0028_0FAD48B4610E2498">
conceive no profe&s;&s;ion is capable of receiv|ing more embelli&s;hments from it.</P>
<P>Connected with the &s;tudy of our own lan|guage is the &s;tudy of ELOQUENCE. It is well known how great a part it con&s;tituted of the Roman education. It is the fir&s;t ac|compli&s;hment in a republic, and often &s;ets the whole machine of government in motion. Let our youth, therefore, be in&s;tructed in this art. We do not extol it too highly when we attribute as much to the power of eloquence as to the &s;word in bringing about the American revolution.</P>
<P>With the u&s;ual arts and &s;ciences that are taught in our American colleges, I wi&s;h to &s;ee a regular cour&s;e of lectures given upon HISTORY and CHRONOLOGY. The &s;cience of government, whether it relates to con&s;ti|tutions or laws, can only be advanced by a careful &s;election of facts, and the&s;e are to be found chiefly in hi&s;tory. Above all, let our youth be in&s;tructed in the hi&s;tory of the an|cient republics, and the progre&s;s of liberty and tyranny in the different &s;tates of Europe. I wi&s;h likewi&s;e to &s;ee the numerous facts that relate to the origin and pre&s;ent &s;tate of COM|MERCE, together with the nature and prin|ciples of MONEY, reduced to &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem as to be intelligible and agreeable to a young man. If we con&s;ider the commerce of our metropolis only as the avenue of the wealth
<PB N="30" REF="019974_0029_0FAD48B50D16EFD8">
of the &s;tate, the &s;tudy of it merits a place in a young man's education; but, I con&s;ider commerce in a much higher light when I recommend the &s;tudy of it in republican &s;eminaries. I view it as the be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t the influence of heriditary monopo|lies of land, and, therefore, the &s;ure&s;t pro|tection again&s;t ari&s;tocracy. I con&s;ider its effects as next to tho&s;e of religion in huma|nizing mankind, and la&s;tly, I view it as the means of uniting the different nations of the world together by the ties of mutual wants and obligations.</P>
<P>CHEMISTRY by unfolding to us the effects of heat and mixture, enlarges our acquaint|ance with the wonders of nature, and the my&s;teries of art, hence it has become, in mo&s;t of the univer&s;ities of Europe, a nece&s;|&s;ary branch of a gentleman's education. In a young country, where improvements in agriculture and manufactures are &s;o much to be de&s;ired, the cultivation of this &s;cience, which explains the principles of both of them, &s;hould be con&s;idered as an object of the ut|mo&s;t importance.</P>
<P>In a &s;tate where every citizen is liable to be a &s;oldier and a legi&s;lator, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary to have &s;ome regular in&s;truction given upon the ART OF WAR and upon PRACTICAL LEGISLATION. The&s;e branches of know|ledge are of too much importance in a re|public
<PB N="31" REF="019974_0030_0FAD48B5C4A95C00">
to be tru&s;ted to &s;olitary &s;tudy, or to a fortuitous acquaintance with books. Let mathematical learning, therefore, be care|fully applied, in our colleges, to gunnery and fortification, and let philo&s;ophy be applied to the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e compo&s;itions which have been made u&s;e of for the terrible pur|po&s;es of de&s;troying human life. The&s;e branches of knowledge will be indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary in our republic, if unfortunately war &s;hould continue hereafter to be the unchri&s;tian mode of arbitrating di&s;putes be|tween Chri&s;tian nations. Again, let our youth be in&s;tructed in all the means of pro|moting national pro&s;perity and independence, whether they relate to improvements in agri|culture, manufactures, or inland navigation. Let him be in&s;tructed further in the general principles of legi&s;lation, whether they relate to revenue, or to the pre&s;ervation of life, liberty or property. Let him be directed frequently to attend the courts of ju&s;tice, where he will have the be&s;t opportunities of acquiring habits of arranging and comparing his ideas by ob&s;erving the &s;ecretion of truth, in the examination of witne&s;&s;es, and where he will hear the laws of the &s;tate explained, with all the advantages of that &s;pecies of eloquence which belongs to the bar. Of &s;o much importance do I conceive it to be, to a young man, to attend occa&s;ionally to the
<PB N="32" REF="019974_0031_0FAD48B68A5241F8">
deci&s;ions of our courts of law, that I wi&s;h to &s;ee our colleges and academies e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, only in county towns.</P>
<P>But further, con&s;idering the nature of our connection with the United States it will be nece&s;&s;ary to make our pupil acquainted with all the prerogatives of the foederal govern|ment. He mu&s;t be in&s;tructed in the nature and variety of treaties. He mu&s;t know the difference in the powers and duties of the &s;everal &s;pecies of amba&s;&s;adors. He mu&s;t be taught wherein the obligations of individuals and of &s;tates are the &s;ame, and wherein they differ. In &s;hort, he mu&s;t acquire a general knowledge of all tho&s;e laws and forms, which unite the &s;overeigns of the earth, or &s;eparate them from each other.</P>
<P>I have only to add that it will be to no pur|po&s;e to adopt this, or any other mode of education, unle&s;s we make choice of &s;uita|ble ma&s;ters to carry our plans into execution. Let our teachers be di&s;tingui&s;hed for their abilities and knowledge. Let them be grave in their manners,&mdash;gentle in their tempers,&mdash;exemplary in their morals, and of found principles in religion and government. Let us not leave their &s;upport to the precarious re&s;ources to be derived from their pupils, but let &s;uch funds be provided for our &s;chools and colleges as will enable us to allow them liberal &s;alaries. By the&s;e means we &s;hall
<PB N="33" REF="019974_0032_0FAD48B7B17D3C38">
render the chairs,&mdash;the profe&s;&s;or&s;hips and rector&s;hips of our colleges and academies objects of competition among learned men. By conferring upon our ma&s;ters that inde|pendence, which is the companion of com|petency, we &s;hall, moreover, &s;trengthen their authority over the youth committed to their care. Let us remember that a great part of the divines, lawyers, phy&s;icians, legi&s;lators, &s;oldiers, generals, delegates, coun&s;ellors, and governors of the &s;tate will probably hereafter pa&s;s through their hands. How great then &s;hould be the wi&s;dom!&mdash;how honourable the rank! and how generous the reward of tho&s;e men who are to form the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary and leading members of the re|public!</P>
<P>I beg pardon for having delayed &s;o long, to &s;ay any thing of the &s;eparate and peculiar mode of education proper for WOMEN in a republic. I am &s;en&s;ible that they mu&s;t con|cur in all our plans of education for young men, or no laws will ever render them effec|tual. To qualify our women for this pur|po&s;e, they &s;hould not only be in&s;tructed in the u&s;ual branches of female education, but they &s;hould be in&s;tructed in the principles of liberty and government; and the obligations of patrioti&s;m, &s;hould be inculcated upon them. The opinions and conduct of men are often regulated by the women in the
<PB N="34" REF="019974_0033_0FAD48B80A374BA0">
mo&s;t arduous enterprizes of life; and their approbation is frequently the principal re|ward of the hero's dangers, and the patriot's toils. Be&s;ides, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> impre&s;&s;ions upon the minds of children are generally derived from the women. Of how much con&s;e|quence, therefore, is it in a republic, that they &s;hould think ju&s;tly upon the great &s;ub|jects of liberty and government!</P>
<P>The complaints that have been made again&s;t religion, liberty and learning, have been made again&s;t each of them in a <HI>&s;eperate</HI> &s;tate. Perhaps like certain liquors, they &s;hould only be u&s;ed in a &s;tate of mixture. They mutually a&s;&s;i&s;t in correcting the abu&s;es, and in improving the good effects of each other. From the combined and reciprocal influence of religion, liberty and learning up|on the morals, manners and knowledge of in|dividuals, of the&s;e, upon government, and of government, upon individuals, it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to mea&s;ure the degrees of happine&s;s and perfection to which mankind may be rai&s;ed. For my part, I can form no ideas of the golden age, &s;o much celebrated by the poets, more delightful, than the contemplation of that happine&s;s which it is now in the power of the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania to confer upon her citizens, by e&s;tabli&s;hing proper modes and places of education in every part of the &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="019974_0034_0FAD48B8CF6D3418">
The <HI>pre&s;ent time</HI> is peculiarly favourable to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the&s;e benevolent and nece&s;&s;ary in&s;titutions in Penn&s;ylvania. The minds of our people have not as yet lo&s;t the yeilding texture they acquired by the heat of the late revolution. They will <HI>now</HI> receive more readily, than five or even three years hence, new impre&s;&s;ions and habits of all kinds. The &s;pirit of liberty <HI>now</HI> pervades every part of the &s;tate. The influence of error and deception are <HI>now</HI> of &s;hort dura|tion. Seven years hence, the affairs of our &s;tate may a&s;&s;ume a new complexion. We may be rivetted to a criminal indifference for the &s;afety and happine&s;s of our&s;elves and our po&s;terity. An ari&s;tocratic or democratic junto may ari&s;e, that &s;hall find its de&s;potic views connected with the prevalence of ig|norance and vice in the &s;tate; or a few art|ful pedagogues who con&s;ider learning as u&s;e|ful only in proportion as it favours their pride or avarice, may prevent all new literary e&s;ta|bli&s;hments from taking place, by rai&s;ing a hue and cry again&s;t them, as the offspring of improper rival&s;hip, or the nur&s;eries of party &s;pirit.</P>
<P>But in vain &s;hall we lavi&s;h pains and ex|pence, in e&s;tabli&s;hing nur&s;eries of virtue and knowledge in every part of the &s;tate. In vain &s;hall we attempt to give the minds of our citizens a virtuous and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">iform bias in

Of the many criminals that have been executed within the&s;e &s;even years, four out of five of them have been foreigners, who have arriv|ed here during the war and &s;ince the peace.
