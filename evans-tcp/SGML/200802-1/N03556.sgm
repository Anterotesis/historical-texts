<P>_'_TIS a very high Character and Commendation that is given in the&s;e Words of the Kingdom of <HI>Judah,</HI> both of Prince and Peo|ple, on the Account of their &s;teady Adherence to the divine Con&s;ti|tution of their Government, and to the Purity of &s;acred In&s;titutions, when the ten Tribes had for a long Time apo&s;tatiz'd to idola|trous Wor&s;hip. And a brighter Repre&s;entation could &s;carce be given in &s;o few Words, of the true Intere&s;t and Glory of a profe&s;&s;ing People. If therefore the opening of this Character, and di&s;|playing &s;ome of the Beauties and Advantages of it, according to the Mea&s;ure of the Gift I have re|ceived, may be of U&s;e to excite a pious Emulati|on in the Rulers and People of this Land, and the

various Orders and Degrees of Men, that com|po&s;e this great Audience, it will &s;ufficiently an|&s;wer the De&s;ign I had in view in the Choice of my Subject.</P>
<P>Concerning this Prophet <HI>Ho&s;ea,</HI> who&s;e Words I have read, we may ob&s;erve, That it appears from the Date of his Prophecy, that he was one of the anciente&s;t of the Prophets who penn'd their Pro|phecies, and continued longe&s;t in the Di&s;charge of the prophetical Function, during the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Reigns of &s;everal Kings; for the Word of the Lord came unto him in the Days of <HI>Uzziah, Jo|tham, Ahaz,</HI> and <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> Kings of <HI>Judah;</HI> and in the Days of <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> the Son of <HI>Joa&s;h,</HI> King of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> (Chap. 1. 1.) The Prophecy con&s;i&s;ts of Reproofs, and Convictions of Sin, and Com|minations of divine Judgments for the awaken|ing a &s;ecure People, and &s;erious and urgent Ex|hortations to Repentance, addre&s;s'd both to the Kingdom of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not &s;pend Time on the Context, the Con|nection of the Ver&s;e of our Text, being variou&s;ly under&s;tood by Interpreters; &s;ome making it the Clo&s;e of the eleventh Chapter; others,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Rivet: Comment: in Ho&s;ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">: Pol: Synop&s;: in Loc.</NOTE> with greater Probability, under&s;tand it as the Begin|ning of a new Di&s;cour&s;e, which the Prophet con|tinues in the following Chapter, upbraiding the apo&s;tate <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> with their Defection from the true Wor&s;hip of GOD, and the Faith and Piety of their Ance&s;tors, and with their vain Confidence in an Arm of Fle&s;h; and upon Conviction there|of, exhorting them to Amendment, and a peni|tent Return to the Lord their GOD. But it may
<PB N="3" REF="004350_0006_100445713ABAAEE8">
conduce not a little to the clearing of the Words, to take &s;ome Notice of the oppo&s;ite Clau&s;e of the Ver&s;e, <HI>Ephraim compa&s;&s;eth me about with Lies, and the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael with Deceit. Ephraim</HI> put in Di&s;tribution with <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as here, is commonly u&s;ed to denote the Hou&s;e of the King, the Princes and Rulers of <HI>I&s;rael; Jeroboam,</HI> who headed the Re|volt from the Hou&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> and the Defection from the in&s;tituted Wor&s;hip of GOD at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> being a Man of that Tribe. And by the Hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> is meant the Body of the ten Tribes. That which they are charged with, is, That they <HI>compa&s;&s;ed GOD about with Lies, and with Deceit.</HI> In which Words the Prophet taxes the Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, Hypocri&s;y, and Idolatry of the <HI>I&s;raelites;</HI> they pretended a mighty Veneration for the GOD of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and Zeal for his Service; yet having de|&s;erted his own In&s;titutions, and &s;et up their Calves at <HI>Dan</HI> and <HI>Bethel,</HI> and wor&s;hipping him by Ima|ges and Rites of their own Invention, it was all, in GOD's Account, <HI>Deceit</HI> and a <HI>Lye.</HI></P>
<P>Perfidy, and Hypocri&s;y in Religion, is, in Scrip|ture, called Lying to God. P&s;al. 78. 36. <HI>They flattered him with their Mouth, and they lyed to him with their Tongues.</HI> So likewi&s;e is Idolatry and Fal&s;e-wor&s;hip; it being familiar in Scripture to term Idols, <HI>Vanities,</HI> and <HI>Lies,</HI> a <HI>Work of Errors,</HI> and <HI>Teachers of Lies.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. 16. 19.

<P>To aggravate this Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the Prophet &s;ets before them the Example of <HI>Judah,</HI> (comprehending the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> and other

pious <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> who adhered to the Hou&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> and the true Wor&s;hip of GOD, after the Revolt of the ten Tribes) with an high Encomium of their Stedfa&s;tne&s;s and Integrity. <HI>But Judah yet ruleth with GOD, and is faithful with the Saint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> It is a De&s;cription of the State of <HI>Judah,</HI> in it's be&s;t and pure&s;t Times. Here are two &s;ignal In&s;tances of the Integrity of the two Tribes, mention'd to their Commendation.</P>
<P N="1">1. That Judah <HI>ruled with GOD.</HI> This has a direct A&s;pect on the Princes and Rulers of <HI>Judah,</HI> who were peculiarly de&s;ign'd by GOD to the Government of the Kingdom: They ruled with GOD, as his Delegates, executing their Commi&s;&s;i|on for his Honour and Intere&s;t, and according to the Direction of his Laws. Some indeed give us this general Meaning of the Words, <HI>Judah</HI> per|&s;i&s;ted faithfully in the Service of GOD, following him as their Guide and Ruler: for <HI>to &s;erve GOD, is to rule with him.</HI> The Glo&s;s, I confe&s;s, &s;eems rather ingenious than &s;olid; for, however true it be (and a great Truth doubtle&s;s it is, tho' a Pa|radox to the World) that <Q>The Service of GOD is not only true Liberty and Freedom, but Dignity and Dominion.</Q> Yet that <HI>Ruling</HI> here is to be under&s;tood in its proper Signification, appears from the tacit Oppo&s;ition between <HI>Ephra|im</HI> and the <HI>Hou&s;e of I&s;rael</HI> on the one Hand, and <HI>Judah</HI> on the other. <HI>Ephraim,</HI> the royal Tribe, that is, the Rulers of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> are &s;uppos'd to <HI>rule without GOD,</HI> when they fell to Idolatry; yea, it was their Ambition, and Lu&s;t of Domination, which was the Cau&s;e of their ca&s;ting off the true Wor&s;hip of GOD; for this politick Rea&s;on it was, that <HI>Jeroboam</HI> &s;et up the idolatrous Wor&s;hip of the golden Calves, and devi&s;ed new In&s;titutions, that by this Means he might &s;trengthen his Dominion,
<PB N="5" REF="004350_0008_100444D2D6A6BC90">
and prevent the Return of the Tribes of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to the Hou&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> which he feared might be occa&s;ion'd by their Re&s;ort to the Temple at <HI>Je|ru&s;alem</HI> to offer Sacrifice, e&s;pecially on the three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Fea&s;ts.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kings 12, 26, 27, 28.</NOTE> And the &s;ame State-Maxims prevailed with all his Succe&s;&s;ors 'till the Captivity, to tread in the &s;ame Steps. But <HI>Judah (i. e.</HI> the Governors of the two Tribes, for GOD <HI>cho&s;e</HI> Ju|dah <HI>to be the Ruler,</HI> 1 Chron. 28. 4.) <HI>yet ruled with GOD,</HI> becau&s;e in <HI>Judah</HI> remained the true and lawful Succe&s;&s;ion of Princes in the Hou&s;e of <HI>David,</HI> cho&s;en and approved of GOD, and becau&s;e in <HI>Judah</HI> the Kingdom remained united with the true and lawful Prie&s;thood, appointed and &s;etled by GOD in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Aaron.</HI> So that GOD him&s;elf ruled by his own In&s;titutions in the King|dom of <HI>Judah:</HI> And e&s;pecially <HI>Judah</HI> might be &s;aid to <HI>rule with GOD,</HI> when the Princes and Go|vernors of <HI>Judah</HI> took Care to admini&s;ter the po|litical Affairs of the Kingdom, and to order Mat|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ers of Religion in it according to the righteous Laws and Ordinances of GOD their &s;upream King.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, That this &s;ame Prophet gives a very different Character of the Princes of <HI>Judah,</HI> repre&s;enting them as guilty of great Irregularities (for which GOD had a Controver&s;y with them) in &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of his Prophecy, particularly, Chap. 5. 10. <HI>The Princes of Judah were like Men that remove the Bounds;</HI> either by introducing Cor|ruption into GOD's Wor&s;hip, by their impious Examples and Decrees, and &s;o encroaching on GOD's Rights, and removing the Bounds of Re|ligion, or by invading the Rights and Properties
<PB N="6" REF="004350_0009_1004454F131C6CF0">
of the Subjects, and &s;o removing the Bounds of Ju&s;tice and Equity; <HI>therefore,</HI> it follows, <HI>I will pour out my Wrath upon them like Water.</HI> How then is this con&s;i&s;tent with their ruling with GOD?</P>
<P>To &s;olve this, we mu&s;t recollect what has been ob&s;erved concerning the Date of this Prophecy, which was given forth, not all at once, but in the &s;everal Reigns of the Kings of <HI>Judah,</HI> in the Days of <HI>Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz,</HI> and <HI>Hezekiah.</HI> Whence it appears, That what the holy Prophet has left on Record, was but a brief Summary of tho&s;e Things that were more largely delivered in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Reigns of &s;o many Kings, and that as he lived and prophecy'd in the Reign of one of the wor&s;t of them, <HI>viz Ahaz,</HI> to the Character of who&s;e Reign the wor&s;t Things here charg'd on the Princes of <HI>Judah,</HI> might well agree; &s;o did he al&s;o continue in the Di&s;charge of the prophe|tick Office, in the Reign of one of the be&s;t, his Son and Succe&s;&s;or, <HI>Hezekiah;</HI> to who&s;e religious and pro&s;perous Reign, the Character exhibited in the Text did undoubtedly belong. Thus <HI>Grotius</HI> under&s;tands it to be a De&s;cription of the Times of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> who re&s;tored the true Wor&s;hip of GOD in <HI>Judah,</HI> when Corruption in Wor&s;hip and Man|ners did exceedingly prevail in the ten Tribes.</P>
<P N="2">2. The other In&s;tance of their Integrity was, That they continued <HI>faithful with the Saints:</HI> Which is to be under&s;tood of the whole Kingdom of <HI>Judah</HI> in general, including both Prince and People, as the <HI>Antithe&s;is</HI> betwixt this, and the for|mer Branch of the Ver&s;e, requires. This is the Prai&s;e of <HI>Judah,</HI> That when his Brethren of the Hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> apo&s;tatiz'd to Idolatry and fal&s;e Wor&s;hip, he was faithful with the <HI>Mo&s;t-Holy,</HI> ac|cording
<PB N="7" REF="004350_0010_1004474252F60100">
to the marginal Ver&s;ion, that is, <HI>with GOD;</HI> which denotes his faithful and con&s;tant adherence to the Wor&s;hip of God; or <HI>with the Saints,</HI> as the Text renders the Word in its mo&s;t proper &amp; u&s;ual Signification. He was faithful in the Service of God in Communion with all the Saints. By the <HI>Saints</HI> may be meant either the godly Patriarchs, and Predece&s;&s;ors of the Jewi&s;h Church, <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob, Mo&s;es</HI> and the &s;ucceeding Pro|phets, by whom God revealed to them his Laws and Ordinances, and directed their Wor&s;hip and Obedience to him: So to be <HI>faithful with the Saints,</HI> is to per&s;evere in the Steps of their pious Ance&s;tors, and faithfully to retain the true Religion in its Purity, as it was tran&s;mitted to them by their Hands. Or by <HI>the Saints</HI> may be meant the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Levites,</HI> the Mini&s;ters of holy Things, who being con&s;ecrated to God, and his &s;pecial Service, were in a peculiar manner dignifyed with the Title of <HI>Saints,</HI> or <HI>holy Ones,</HI> the High Prie&s;t, more emi|nently, <HI>Aaron the Saint of the Lord.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 106. 16.</NOTE> And <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in ble&s;&s;ing the Tribes of <HI>Levi, he &s;aid, Let thy Thummim, and thy Urim be with thy holy one.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. 33. 8.</NOTE> Thus <HI>Judah</HI> was <HI>faithful with the Saints,</HI> when <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> with his Princes and People join'd with the &s;acred Order the Prie&s;ts of the Lord, in pro|moting the Wor&s;hip of God, when they kept clo&s;e to &s;acred In&s;titutions, attending the Service of the Temple, perform'd by the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Le|vites,</HI> according to God's Ordinance, whom <HI>Jero|boam</HI> and his Succe&s;&s;ors had ca&s;t off from executing the Prie&s;t's Office.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. 11. 14.</NOTE> In this we find <HI>Abijah</HI> King of <HI>Judah</HI> glorying in his Speech to <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> and the Tribes of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> 2 Chron. 13. 9, 10. <HI>But as for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not for&s;a|ken him, and the Prie&s;ts which mini&s;ter unto the Lord

are the Sons of</HI> Aaron, <HI>and the</HI> Levites <HI>wait upon their Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. And this indeed &s;erv'd to heighten the Commendation of <HI>Judah,</HI> that not|with&s;tanding the Revolt and Degeneracy of his Brethren, and the ill Example of their idolatrous Wor&s;hip, he &s;tood firm in his Loyalty, &amp; Fidelity to God in the Profe&s;&s;ion and Practice of the true Religion. Judah <HI>yet ruleth with God, and is yet faithful</HI> &amp;c. But it &s;hall &s;uffice to have offer'd thus much in way of Explication.</P>
<P>Now tho' the State of the Jews under the old Te&s;tament, was properly a <HI>Theocracy,</HI> God him&s;elf being in a peculiar manner their King, having by various extraordinary Methods, form'd them a People for him&s;elf, took upon him, by the general Con&s;ent of that Nation, the Government over them; their Con&s;titution both civil and eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal, was of his forming, the Laws by which their Common-Wealth was admini&s;tred, as well as their religious In&s;titutions were enacted by his immedi|ate Authority; their Magi&s;trates and Rulers were of his more immediate and peculiar De&s;ignation, authorized and furni&s;h'd by him with Powers for the execution of their Office, as his Deputies on Earth,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">For which Rea&s;on I humbly conceive that the glorious Title of <HI>Gods</HI> in Scripture is attributed, if not appropriated only to the Magi&s;trates of the I&s;raeliti&s;h Nation, as they were in a peculiar Manner the Delagates, or Lieutenants of the God of I&s;rael on Earth, impower'd by a &s;pecial Commi&s;&s;ion from him to execute his Laws; and e&s;pecially as they were in that Capacity Types of the Me&s;&s;iah, who is that in Truth, which they were in Type, <HI>God over all ble&s;&s;ed for ever.</HI> To which purpo&s;e the Words of our Saviour are remarkable, who in quoting that Pa&s;&s;age of the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 82. 6. <HI>I have &s;aid ye are Gods</HI> &amp;c. from thence ju&s;tifying his own Claim to the Title of <HI>the Son of God</HI> again&s;t the cavils of the Jews, thus argues, Joh. 10. 36. <HI>If he called them Gods unto whom the Word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken; &s;ay ye of him, whom the Father hath &s;anctifyed, and &s;ent into the World, thou bla&s;pheme&s;t, becau&s;e I &s;aid, I am the Son of God?</HI> Tho&s;e Words, <HI>and the Scriptures cannot be broken,</HI> plainly &s;hew, that the Prophet's Words were &s;poken of the Jewi&s;h Magi&s;trates, with a typical Reference to Chri&s;t (in which Re&s;pect they have the Nature of Prophecys, and mu&s;t be fulfilled) and were verifyed and fulfilled in him, who (being God, not only by Office, but by Nature (as the Antitype always carries in it the Truth and Reality of what was but &s;hadow'd in the Type) and therefore equal to his Charge) is appointed by the Father, his high Commi&s;&s;ioner to the Children of Men.</NOTE> who were al&s;o favour'd with frequent

<P N="1">1. When we receive, and faithfully and invio|lably retain the true Religion, Faith, and Wor&s;hip, as it is delivered to us in the in&s;pired Writings of holy Men of GOD, the Prophets and Apo&s;tles. As the Jewi&s;h Church was faithful with the Saints in adhering to the Religion tran&s;mitted to them by their pious Ance&s;tors, and to the Pre&s;criptions and Ordinances of the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> &s;o may Chri&s;tians, in a &s;pecial Manner, be &s;aid to be, when they adhere faithfully to the Doctrines and In&s;titutions of the new Te&s;tament, deliver'd to them in the &s;acred Writings of the Evangeli&s;ts and Apo&s;tles. <HI>This is the Faith which was once delivered unto the Saints,</HI> and which all the Saints have been mo&s;t careful to pre&s;erve, not only for their own U&s;e and Benefit, but as a &s;acred De|po&s;itum to be handed down to &s;ucceeding Ages. And this will be the be&s;t Evidence to Mini&s;ters and Churches at this Day, of their being truly apo&s;toli|cal, the true and approv'd Succe&s;&s;ors of the A|po&s;tles, without which, all other Rea&s;ons and Pleas
<PB N="31" REF="004350_0034_10044792EB62BC38">
to &s;upport &s;uch a Claim, will plainly appear far fetch'd and inconclu&s;ive; This, I &s;ay, will be the only &s;ure Evidence, namely, Their retaining the true Faith, the true Wor&s;hip, and the true Piety which the Apo&s;tles taught and recommended by their Preaching and Example, and have tran&s;mit|ted to us in their Writings.</P>
<P N="2">2. When we carefully imitate the Saints that have gone before us in their Faith and Piety; not only in the Profe&s;&s;ion of the true Religion, but in the Vertues of an holy Life. When we follow the Foot-&s;teps of the Flock of Chri&s;t, and tread in the Steps of good Men, whether of &s;uch as have been of our &s;pecial Acquaintance, or our pious Fore-fathers, who were &s;hining Patterns of Faith, Zeal, Self-denial, Charity, Humility, and other Chri&s;tian Vertues; or of the Saints in former Ages, who&s;e pious Example is left on Record for our Imitation; as we are required to walk in the Steps of faithful <HI>Abraham,</HI> and to be <HI>Followers of tho&s;e who thro' Faith and Patience inherit the Pro|mi&s;es</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 4. 12. Heb. 6. 12.</NOTE> This will be the &s;ure&s;t Proof of our Faithfulne&s;s with the Saints, as it evidences our Fellow&s;hip with them in the &s;ame Spirit.</P>
<P N="3">3. When we faithfully adhere to the Commu|nion of living Saints, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the &s;acred Order, and under the Conduct of a pious and faithful Mini&s;try, ob&s;erve all the Ordinances and Commandments of GOD our Saviour, in particu|lar Church Fellow&s;hip, and duely attend the Duties that &s;uch a Relation binds us to; approving our Faithfulne&s;s to GOD in keeping the Charge of his Covenant, in the &s;everal In&s;tances I have men|tion'd;
<PB N="32" REF="004350_0035_10044543126C2020">
and maintaining a firm Con&s;tancy in the Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of the Truth, and in the Duties of our ho|ly Profe&s;&s;ion, whatever Temptations &s;urround us to move us from our own Stedfa&s;tne&s;s. The&s;e, I take to be the principal Things intended by being <HI>faithful with the Saints.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> When may this Character be applied to a People in general? Particular Per&s;ons may be found faithful to GOD in Times of general A|po&s;tacy and prevailing Corruption; but when may it be &s;aid of a People in general, as here, they are <HI>faithful with the Saints?</HI></P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer in a Word, When not only an outward Face of Religion, or Form of Godli|ne&s;s, is kept up by a profe&s;&s;ing People, but the Power and Practice of Piety, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Holine&s;s is found in a prevailing Degree among them; when the Body of Profe&s;&s;ors keep clo&s;e to GOD's In&s;titutions, tho' &s;ome, yea many Hypo|crites and wicked People may be intermix'd with them, which mu&s;t be expected in the pure&s;t Com|munities, 'till the great Day of Seperation; yet when Religion has the vi&s;ible A&s;cendant, and no open Iniquity or Impiety is tolerated, when tho&s;e that bear Authority in Families, Churches, or in the State, faithfully exert their Endeavours to &s;up|pre&s;s Sin, and promote Religion and Vertue: When this is the Ca&s;e of a People in general, tho' there may be yet much ami&s;s in them (as there was in <HI>Hezekiah's</HI> Time) that calls for Reforma|tion, yet according to the Mitigations and Abate|ments the Mercies of GOD are wont to allow, they may be denominated a religious faithful People.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="004350_0036_1004479474BD4050">
So I proceed</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> To &s;hew the Connection between <HI>Ru|ling with GOD,</HI> and being <HI>faithful with the Saints.</HI> And this appears nece&s;&s;ary, with Re&s;pect to the Per&s;ons of Rulers, and the People under their Charge.</P>
<P N="1">1. With re&s;pect to the Per&s;ons of Rulers, it is evidently &s;uppos'd in their <HI>ruling with</HI> GOD, that they are al&s;o faithful with the Saints; that they profe&s;s and practice the true Faith and Religon in common with all the Saints, and u&s;e their Power to encourage, protect, and promote it, as I have &s;hewed already. And on the other Hand, &s;uppo&s;ing Power and Dominion given to the Saints of the Mo&s;t High, or, which is the &s;ame Thing, to tho&s;e that are faithful in the Commu|nion of Saints, it is quite out of Character for them to u&s;e their Authority for any other Ends than tho&s;e of GOD's Glory, the Intere&s;t of Reli|gion, and the Good of their People; and the&s;e are in&s;eperably link'd together.</P>
<P N="2">2. With re&s;pect to the People under their Charge, we may ob&s;erve, That a People's Repu|tation for Religion and Virtue will very much follow the Character of their Rulers. If they are vicious and corrupt, no Wonder Iniquity abounds in a Land, and Corruption of Manners every where prevails; when tho&s;e that &s;hou'd be a Ter|ror to evil Works and evil Workers, do rather countenance and promote them: When vile Men are exalted to Places of power and Tru&s;t, no other can be expected but that the Wicked will walk on every Side.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 12. 8.</NOTE> On the contrary, when Rulers
<PB N="34" REF="004350_0037_1004503867B93C38">
are pious and faithful, and employ their Power on GOD's Side, for the Advancement of pure Religi|on, their Example and Authority will go far to en|gage a People to Faithfulne&s;s in their Duty to GOD in the ob&s;ervance of his Ordinances, and will have a marvellous Influence on their Religion and Morals.</P>
<P>And if we look over the Hi&s;tory of the Kings of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> we &s;hall find this Ob&s;ervation commonly verifyed, That as their Rulers were well, or ill-affected to Religion, and the Wor&s;hip of GOD, &s;uch were for the mo&s;t Part the Body of the People, who generally follow'd their Leaders. When tho&s;e that are in Authority are endow'd with Grace and Wi&s;dom from above, and go be|fore their People in an Example of Piety, and u&s;e their Authority for its right Ends, in the Suppre&s;&s;i|on of Vice, and Reformation of Manners, it may rea&s;onably be hop'd that the People under their Charge, will <HI>lead quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godline&s;s &amp; Hone&s;tly.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 2. 2.</NOTE> They have it much in their Power by the Sword of Ju&s;tice that is put into their Hands to re&s;train and &s;uppre&s;s the open Prac|tice of every Thing that is impious and vicious, that the criminal Actors of it &s;hall be forc'd to lurk in Corners, and the Guilt lye on them&s;elves alone, and not on the Publick. And from the publick Countenance given to Religion, all that look for Preferment in the State, will readily ap|prehend what mu&s;t be the nece&s;&s;ary Qualification. And their pious Example in the&s;e honourable Stations will have an attractive and engaging In|fluence on all about them, and &s;erve to bring Vice and vicious Per&s;ons into Contempt, and
<PB N="35" REF="004350_0038_1004479903047600">
Religion and Virtue into Reputation, and &s;o take off much of the Prejudice that lies on the carnal Hearts of Men again&s;t it. We all know what an happy Influence that zealous Re&s;olution of <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> had on the Congregation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when he &s;o bravely declar'd to them, that tho' every Man of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;hould for&s;ake GOD and his Service, <HI>as for me and my Hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the Lord;</HI> upon which all the Motives of Honour and Con&s;cience con&s;pir'd to bring them on to join with him in the &s;ame noble Re&s;olution, <HI>We al&s;o will &s;erve the Lord, for he is our GOD.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h. 24. 15, 18.</NOTE> And they were as good as their Word, while this zealous Magi&s;trate liv'd, <HI>the People &s;erv'd the Lord all the Days of Jo&s;hua.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Judg 2. 7.</NOTE> And thus may it be expected that a People will be found faithful with the Saints, when their Ma|gi&s;trates and Leaders rule with GOD.</P>
<P>Wherefore I add in the la&s;t Place,</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That it will be highly for the Intere&s;t and Reputation of a profe&s;&s;ing People, e&s;pecially in Times of Degeneracy, to abide <HI>faithful with the Saints.</HI> I need not in&s;i&s;t here, the Evidences and Proofs of this are obvious to the lea&s;t Reflection. Thus when good <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> (to who&s;e Reign, I &s;up|po&s;e the Prophet's Words to refer,) had purg'd out Corruptions of Wor&s;hip, re&s;tor'd Religion to its Purity, the Kingdom of <HI>Judah</HI> began to lift up its Head, and recover its &s;inking Reputation, and GOD magnifyed him in the Sight of the Nations, and ble&s;s'd him with Succe&s;s, Victory, Wealth, and Honour. Nothing can contribute more to the Reputation of a People, than their Fidelity to GOD in keeping his Covenant, and Command|ments.

<P>The Churches of Chri&s;t in this Land are foun|ded on a &s;acred Covenant, tran&s;acted between GOD and them, in a more &s;olemn and explicit Manner than perhaps in mo&s;t Churches in the World.

from our Back&s;liding to a more con&s;cionable and faithful ob&s;ervance of our covenanted Duty.</P>
<P>I purpos'd, (would the Time have permitted) to &s;et before you, and earne&s;tly recommend &s;ome &s;pecial In&s;tances of Duty, wherein GOD expects and requires you &s;hould give a Proof of your Loy|alty and Fidelity to him, in Conformity to the Example of our godly Ance&s;tors, and to the Practice of the Saints in all Ages. Let me men|tion only the general Heads, and &s;o draw to a Clo&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. Your Loyalty and Faithfulne&s;s to GOD de|mands the &s;trict Ob&s;ervance of all <HI>moral Duties,</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Hone&s;ty, Charity, Sobriety, and Temperance. If you fail here, not only the Saints, but many virtuous Pagans, will ri&s;e up in Judgment again&s;t you, and condemn you.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Ob&s;ervance of <HI>po&s;itive In&s;titutions,</HI> the Duties of GOD's Wor&s;hip, &s;ecret and &s;ocial Prayer, attending on a Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, &s;ubmit|ting your &s;elves to your &s;piritual Guides, <HI>who &s;peak to you the Word of GOD, and watch for your Souls;</HI> a &s;trict Care to &s;anctify the Lord's Day, and re|verently to approach the Lord's Table, ob&s;erving all the Ordinances of the Hou&s;e of GOD in Com|munion with particular Churches. The free, and unmole&s;ted Enjoyment of &s;uch Go&s;pel In&s;titutions was the known De&s;ign of our Fathers in coming hither. The&s;e Things indeed do belong to the Form of Godline&s;s; yet have they a vital Con|nection with the Power thereof, in&s;omuch that where this is wanting, they will be either wholly neglected, or but carele&s;ly and &s;uperficially at|tended. But the Life and Power of Religion, wherever it is, will evidence it &s;elf in a &s;trict Ob|&s;ervance
<PB N="54" REF="004350_0057_1004505B2E31DDE0">
of the&s;e divine In&s;titutions, which are de&s;ign'd for the Honour of GOD in the World, and a publick Te&s;timony of his People's Loyalty and Subjection to him, which have ever been had in precious E&s;teem with all real Saints, as the Means of maintaining and improving their &s;piri|tual Life in Communion with GOD, till they ar|rive to immediate Vi&s;ion in the Life of Heaven, and al&s;o as the Means of reviving the Power of Godline&s;s when it is fallen into Decay. When it plea&s;es GOD to &s;end down his quickening Spirit upon a People, who have very much lo&s;t the Spi|rit and Life of Religion, and have degenerated into Lukewarmne&s;s and Formality, he ordinarily makes U&s;e of the In&s;tituted Forms of Religion among them, as the Vehicles of tho&s;e heavenly Influences, particularly the Word preached and heard, Fa&s;ting and Prayer. And by this Means, Religion is propagated from Parents to Children, from one Generation to another. Wherefore</P>
<P N="3">3. Another Article which demands your mo&s;t &s;erious Regards is the keeping up <HI>Family Religion,</HI> Family In&s;truction, Wor&s;hip and Government. 'Tis not to be doubted, but that the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of Youth, and mo&s;t of the Iniquities that abound in the Land, are mainly owing to the criminal Remi&s;sne&s;s of Governours of Families, or of tho&s;e that ought to be &s;o, with re&s;pect to the religious Education of tho&s;e under their Charge. And all that Magi&s;trates or Mini&s;ters can do to reform them, will be to little Purpo&s;e, unle&s;s Heads of Families faithfully do their Part: And if there be any Hope of a more general Reformation and Amend|ment of what is ami&s;s among us, it mu&s;t chiefly be done by a more &s;trict Care of Family Religion, and of the virtuous and pious Education of Youth. O remember the Charge of GOD that lies upon

<P N="4">4.
