<Q><BIBL><HI>I. TIMOTHY II. 1, 2.</HI></BIBL>
<P>I exhort therefore that fir&s;t of all, &s;upplications, prayers, interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of thanks be made for all men:</P>
<P>For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet, and peaceable life, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty.</P></Q>

<P>_AS it is a &s;igular favour and di&s;tingui&s;hing privilege to be betru&s;ted with the divine Ora|cles, according to that in P&s;al. 147.19, 20. <HI>He &s;heweth his word unto Jacob, his &s;tatutes, and his judgments unto I&s;rael. He hath not dealt &s;o with any nation.</HI> And that, in Rom. 3.1, 2. <HI>What advan|tage hath the Jew? &mdash; Much every way, chiefly, becau&s;e that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</HI> So to hearken unto, and obey the voice of GOD in his word, is, the mo&s;t &s;ure &amp; certain way for a per&s;on or people to become truly and
<PB N="2" REF="002841_0005_0FE674F08048B548">
really happy. And hence, it is to be looked up|on as a good <HI>Omen,</HI> a token for good, that tho&s;e who are &s;et in the highe&s;t and mo&s;t exalted Pla|ces and Stations among this People, do not only permit and allow, but call the Me&s;&s;engers of the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the Di&s;pen&s;ers of his holy Word, to be their Remembrancers, to put them in mind of the will of GOD, and their Duty, who do An|nually introduce the weighty bu&s;ine&s;s &amp; affairs of this Day, not only by &s;olemn Prayer and Sup|plication, to the Prayer-hearing GOD; but al&s;o by giving attention unto the Word, which is profi|table for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, and for In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s. And the Tribes do come up, the Tribes of the Lord, to the Te&s;ti|mony of I&s;rael. Per&s;ons of all Ranks, Orders and Degrees come up to the Sanctuary of the Lord, and pre&s;ent them&s;elves before the mo&s;t High GOD, practically &s;aying with them, in Luke 3.14. <HI>And what &s;hall we do?</HI> Well, the words which have been now read do lay before all &s;orts of Per&s;ons their Duty, and &s;how them what they are to do in their &s;everal Places and Capacities, to promote the be&s;t Intere&s;t of the People among&s;t whom they dwell.</P>
<P>The&s;e words are contained in an <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> that was written by the great Apo&s;tle &amp; Doctor of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> unto his Son <HI>Timothy.</HI> That admirable Per&s;on who after he had been a violent Per&s;ecu|tor of Chri&s;t, became a zealous Preacher of him, did labour abundantly to advance his cau&s;e; and had the intere&s;t of Religion, continually lying very much upon his heart.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002841_0006_0FE674CDDE67A548">After he had planted a Church at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> he having occa&s;ion to depart from thence, and go in|to <HI>Macedonia,</HI> to promote the work of the Lord there, be&s;ought <HI>Timothy</HI> to abide &s;till in <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> for the better ordering, in&s;tructing and e&s;tabli&s;h|ing of the Church there; and when he was ab&s;ent from him, he wrote this <HI>Epistle</HI> to him to encou|rage and in&s;truct him in his work, and &s;hew him how to behave him&s;elf in the Hou&s;e of GOD.</P>
<P>And having directed him in the <HI>fir&s;t Chapter,</HI> how to maintain the Truth of the Go&s;pel, and defend it again&s;t the Teachers of the Law, and &s;hewed him how to &s;tate the true u&s;e and end of the Law, which being rightly under&s;tood and u&s;ed is not contrary, but con&s;onant unto the Go&s;pel; He does in this <HI>&s;econd Chapter,</HI> teach and in&s;truct him with re&s;pect unto divine Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>In the words of our Text, with which the Chap|ter begins, we have a very &s;erious and pathetical Exhortation. And here we may ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Per&s;on Exhorting,</HI> viz. The holy and in&s;pired Apo&s;tle. <HI>I exhort</HI> (&s;aith he) or <HI>de&s;ire,</HI> as it is in the Margin.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Duty exhorted to</HI>; or what it was the Apo&s;tle &s;hewed his concern to have done, and that was, <HI>That &s;upplications, prayers, interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of thanks &s;hould be made.</HI> Supplicati|ons and Prayers for the &s;upply of wants: Inter|ce&s;&s;ions for others&punc; And giving of Thanks for good things be&s;towed.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Whom this Duty doth concern</HI>; or who are to be employed herein. And the Apo&s;tle doth not only call upon <HI>Timothy,</HI> to perform this duty,
<PB N="4" REF="002841_0007_0FE674F46C0BECB8">
and attend this part of wor&s;hip. Nor doth he only call upon him to put others upon it: but he exhorts <HI>That prayers be made,</HI> &amp;c. intimating, that <HI>Timothy</HI> &s;hould not only do it him&s;elf; but al&s;o put others upon doing of it. Mini&s;ters mu&s;t not only give them&s;elves to Prayer; but al&s;o put all others upon this duty, and &s;tir them up to it, as they have opportunity.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>weight and &s;tre&s;s</HI> that the Apo&s;tle lays upon it. I exhort that <HI>fir&s;t of all,</HI> or <HI>principally</HI>: intimating, that it is a nece&s;&s;ary duty that mu&s;t not be neglected.</P>

<P>From the&s;e words, thus con&s;idered, many Ob|&s;ervations might be rai&s;ed: But I would take Notice only of tho&s;e things in the words which may more particularly &s;uit the occa&s;ion of the Day. And &s;o in&s;i&s;t only on the following Doctrines or Propo&s;itions, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>This is the Be&s;t and the Greate&s;t thing that they can de&s;ire for them&s;elves, or that their be&s;t Friends can wi&s;h unto them: And this is what they &s;hould be always mo&s;t Sollicitou&s;ly con|cerned about.</P>
<P>But what is it to lead a Quiet and a Peaceable Life? What to live in the practice of true god|line&s;s? What to live Hone&s;tly? And why &s;hould all &s;orts of Per&s;ons among a People be Sol|licitou&s;ly concerned that they may lead a Quiet and Peaceable Life, in all Godline&s;s &amp; Hone&s;ty? Or, How doth it appear, that this is the greate&s;t and the be&s;t thing that can be de&s;ired for a Pro|fe&s;&s;ing People? The&s;e things may come under our con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>What is it for a People to lead a Quiet and a Peaceable Life?</HI> And</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To lead a Quiet and a Peaceable Life, is, to be freed from War, and all Mole&s;tation from Ene|mies.</HI> When a People hear the &s;ound of the Trumphet, and the Alarm of War; when the Enemy is at the gate; when they are be&s;et and a&s;&s;aulty by their Adver&s;aries, &s;o that there is no &s;afety for him that comes in, or for him that goes out; when they are often hearing of Garments rolled in blood; or if they only hear the rumors of War, they do not live quietly and peaceably&punc; But when they have no Enemies to mole&s;t them;
<PB N="7" REF="002841_0010_0FE674CF8042F0B8">
when there is no breaking in, nor going out; when they &s;it every one under his vine &amp; figtree, and there is none to make them affraid: they lead a quiet and a peaceable life. And altho' this may not be what is immediately intended in our Text; yet, Happy is the People that is in &s;uch a ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. To lead a quiet and a peaceable life, is, <HI>To be &s;ecured and protected in the peaceable and quiet enjoyment of their Rights, Liberties and Pri|vileges.</HI> As there are Enemies without, who do often draw the Sword again&s;t them, and mole&s;t, and di&s;quiet a People: &s;o there are many within them, and among them&s;elves, or el&s;e-where, who would di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them of their E&s;tates, or deprive them of their Liberties &amp; Privileges: but when they are protected and defended in the quiet and peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their own Rights, and have their invaluable Liberties and Privileges &s;ecured unto them, and they enjoy them quietly, they may be &s;aid to lead quiet and peaceable lives.</P>
<P N="3">3. To lead quiet and peaceable lives, is, <HI>to Live quietly and peaceably together.</HI> When they are at Peace among them&s;elves, and live quietly to|gether; when Families live Peaceably &amp; quiet|ly; when there is peace and quietne&s;s in Towns and Churches; and in all Societies among a Peo|ple, they may be &s;aid to lead quiet and peace|able lives. And this is what they are required and commanded to do. 1 The&s;. 4.11. <HI>Study to be quiet.</HI> And in Heb. 12.14. <HI>Follow peace with all men.</HI> Rom. 12.18. <HI>If it be po&s;&s;ible as much as in you lyeth, live peaceably with all men.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="8" REF="002841_0011_0FE674F7C12A2438">II. <HI>What is it to live in the due exerci&s;e and practice of true Godline&s;s?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. It implies, <HI>their being like unto GOD.</HI> To be godly is to be like GOD, and the more like unto GOD any are, the more godly are they. Altho' Men have lo&s;t the Image of GOD, yet that glorious One hath of his rich Grace &s;o order|ed things, that they may be renewed in his Image. Col. 3.10. <HI>And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the Image of him that created him.</HI> They have tho&s;e divine Qua|lities and Di&s;po&s;itions infu&s;ed into them, and implanted in them which render <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">em like unto GOD, and &s;o they are made Partakers of the di|vine Nature; as it is expre&s;&s;ed, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.4. Now when they have the Image of GOD renewed in them, tho&s;e Graces implanted in them, which are the fruits of the Spirit of GOD, and live in the exerci&s;e of the&s;e Graces, &s;o as to &s;hew forth the virtues and prai&s;es of him who hath called them out of darkne&s;s into his marvellous light, imita|ting him in all his imitable excellencies and per|fections, treading in his &s;teps, and following his example: This is to live in the exerci&s;e and practice of godline&s;s. And this is what is requi|red and commanded, Math. 5.48. <HI>Be ye perfect as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</HI> And in 1 Pet. 1.16. <HI>Be ye Holy for I am Holy.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To be godly, or to live in the exerci&s;e of godline&s;s, is, <HI>to &s;tudy &amp; endeavour to plea&s;e GOD in all that they do.</HI> And this implies, their &s;hunning and avoiding what is di&s;plea&s;ing to GOD, and &s;o their departing from Iniquity, and for&s;aking every
<PB N="9" REF="002841_0012_0FE674CFA861E018">
way of Sinning; for Sin is that abominable thing which the Soul of the Lord hates, <HI>Jer.</HI> 44.4. And their &s;tudying and endeavouring to know what GOD would have them to do in every &s;tate and condition, and under whatever circum&s;tan|ces they are; and when they know what GOD would have them to do, apply them&s;elves to the performance of it; and &s;o endeavour to do always the things that plea&s;e GOD, and in &s;uch a man|ner as will be acceptable to him: and &s;o devote them&s;elves entirely to him. This is to live in the exerci&s;e of godline&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It is to live and walk with GOD.</HI> To live godlily is to think and meditate much on GOD, to thir&s;t for GOD, even for the living GOD, and follow after him from Duty to Duty, and from Ordinance to Ordinance, and &s;o walk in all his Ordinances, drawing near to him in all the ways of his appointment, never being &s;atisfied and con|tented before they find him, and &s;it under his &s;hadow with great delight, and find his fruit to be very &s;weet and plea&s;ant unto them. This is to live in the exerci&s;e &amp; practice of true godline&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>What is it to live Hone&s;tly?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> This hath reference to our carriage &amp; be|haviour towards Men. And &s;o <HI>Men live hone&s;tly, when they are &s;incere and plain-hearted in all their dealings with one another</HI>; not only their trading and commerce, but al&s;o in the di&s;charge of every duty that they ought to perform towards one a|nother: when every one looks at the good of others, as well as his own; according to that in <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.4. <HI>Look not every man on his own things; but every
<PB N="10" REF="002841_0013_0FE674F7E79E6908">
man al&s;o on the things of others.</HI> And when they have their conver&s;ations towards one another in &s;implicity, and godly &s;incerity, not with fle&s;hly wi&s;dom; but by the Grace of GOD, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.12.</P>
<P N="4">IV. We may con&s;ider, <HI>How it appears that this is the best thing than can be de&s;ired &amp; wi&s;hed for, with re&s;pect unto a Profe&s;&s;ing People</HI>? And &s;o that this is what all &s;orts of Per&s;ons among them &s;hould be &s;ollicitou&s;ly concerned about, that they may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty. Now this will appear if we con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. When a People do lead &s;uch a life, and live in the due exerci&s;e and practice of godline&s;s and hone&s;ty, <HI>The Name of GOD is greatly honoured and glorified.</HI> There is nothing to be thought of that is of &s;o great Importance and Concernment, as that whereby GOD is honoured and glorified: for he is Infinitely worthy of it, who is the chief and &s;upreme good, the fir&s;t Cau&s;e &amp; the la&s;t End of all things; a Being full of all po&s;&s;ible Per|fection, and hath made all things for the advance|ment of his own glory, and laid all Men, and e&s;pecially his own People under infinite Obliga|tions to honour and glorifie him. They are a People whom he hath formed for him&s;elf, that they might &s;hew forth his prai&s;e, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 43.21. And they have peculiar advantages to honour and glo|rifie GOD. And hence, it is not a matter of in|difference whether GOD be honoured by them or no; but it is of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Now the more quiet and peaceable a People
<PB N="11" REF="002841_0014_0FE674D3ADA6D420">
are, and the more there is of true godline&s;s and hone&s;tly among them, the more is GOD honoured and glorified by them. When the command|ments of GOD are obeyed by them, and they manife&s;t their care to plea&s;e GOD, then he ac|counts him&s;elf honoured and glorified by them; their hearts are &s;et upon honouring and glorifying of GOD, and they do advance his declarative glory. Whereas on the other hand, GOD is greatly di&s;honoured by a People, when they live in &s;trife and contention, and when impiety and di&s;hone&s;ty prevails among them.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Peoples leading a quiet and peaceable life in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty, <HI>will tend very much to their own great Benefit and Advantage.</HI> They cannot po&s;&s;ibly do any thing that will tend &s;o much unto their own good as this will, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.8. And that whether they are con&s;idered per|&s;onally, and particularly: Or, as a People. As for particular Per&s;ons among&s;t a People, there is nothing will promote their Intere&s;t and Happi|ne&s;s &s;o much as their living in the practice of true godline&s;s and hone&s;ty: for herein they will find that Plea&s;ure, Sweetne&s;s and Satisfaction, which will &s;ufficiently reward them for all the care and pains they take to live holily and godlily. And for a few years Service here, they will be recom|penced with an Eternity of bli&s;s and happine&s;s in the coming world. And then the more there is of godline&s;s and peace, and hone&s;ty among a Peo|ple, the better it will fare with them in all re&s;pects, and upon all accounts, as they are a People.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="12" REF="002841_0015_0FE674FE12C2F698">1. If a People would live in the exerci&s;e of godline&s;s and hone&s;ty, <HI>They would hereby be &s;ecu|red from amazing Judgments and Calamities.</HI> It is accounted a terrible thing to &s;mart under aw|ful Judgments and Calamities. A People are very apt to grown under them; and they account it an happy thing to be freed therefrom. And as Sin does procure them all. Jer. 4.18. <HI>Thy way, and thy doings have procured the&s;e things unto you</HI>: &s;o if a People would live in peace and in the practice of godline&s;s and hone&s;ty, they would be &s;afe and out of danger of Judgments or Cala|mities. When there was a de&s;troying Judgment coming upon the Cities of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> it was declared to <HI>Abraham,</HI> that if there could have been found <HI>Ten</HI> godly Per&s;ons among them, the whole city &s;hould be &s;pared for the &s;ake of tho&s;e <HI>righteous Ones,</HI> Gen. 18.32. whereby it is intimated unto us, what ble&s;&s;ings godly Ones are to the Places where they dwell, and how much they do to &s;ecure &s;uch Places from Judgments and Calamities.

<P>That when Civil Rulers are In&s;trumental to promote Peace &amp; Godline&s;s, and Hone&s;ty among&s;t a People, &s;uch a People are greatly benefitted by them. Very great is the good and advantage which a People receive by &s;uch Rulers; and well may they be called Pillars &amp; Shields, and &s;trong Foundations, and the Breath of their No&s;trils, as they &s;ometimes are. But then,</P>
<P>It is GOD that makes them to be what they are. As He &s;ets them in tho&s;e Places wherein they are &s;o &s;erviceable &amp; beneficial to their Peo|ple: &s;o all their Gifts &amp; Qualifications are from GOD: It is He that hath qualified them for the&s;e Places, and &s;pirited them to improve their Gifts and Parts, their Opportunities and Advantages for the good and benefit of their People.</P>
<P>And therefore altho' &s;uch Rulers are to be re|&s;pected &amp; honoured, and &s;o acknowledged as in|&s;trumental of great good in the hands of GOD; yet, GOD is in a peculiar manner to be acknow|ledged herein; unto Him are we to give the prai&s;e &amp; glory hereof. We are hereby brought under very great obligations to gratitude &amp; thank|fulne&s;s unto him.</P>
<P>This is all the return we can make unto him for &s;o great and unde&s;erved a favour, to give
<PB N="27" REF="002841_0030_0FE674E6CB07E5F8">
Thanks unto his holy Name, with affected and enlarged hearts, and to walk in &s;ome mea&s;ure agreeable there-unto.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall now proceed to the Improvement, and apply what hath been &s;aid.</P>
<P>USE 1 <HI>Hence we &s;ee what cau&s;e of Humilia|tion, and deep &amp; bitter Lamentation there is, That there is &s;o much Impiety &amp; Di&s;hone&s;ty prevailing in this Land.</HI> We are fallen into great Apo&s;ta|cies and &s;ore Declen&s;ions, have lo&s;t much of the Life &amp; Power of Godline&s;s; and the Form of it &s;eems to be going too; and tho' GOD hath been calling aloud to us by his Judgments to Repent, and Reform, yet we go on &s;till in our Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, and after all that GOD hath done to reclaim us, What &s;inful &amp; &s;candalous Contentions have there been, which make way for Confu&s;ion, and every evil Work: And how notorious does Pride and Idlene&s;s, Oppre&s;&s;ion, Sabbath breaking, prophane Cur&s;ing &amp; Swearing, Drunkenne&s;s &amp; Uncleanne&s;s, and many more Abominations abound and pre|vail among&s;t us! And how are we ripening a|pace hereby for more terrible &amp; amazing Judg|ments and Calamities! This is for a Lamentati|on, and &s;hould be for a Lamentation.</P>
<P>USE 2. <HI>Hence &s;ee what ground &amp; occa&s;ion there is of Joy &amp; Rejoycing that there are any among us, who have a zealous concern to promote Peace and Godline&s;s, and Hone&s;ty among this People.</HI> Altho' we are grown very Degenerate &amp; Corrupt, and
<PB N="28" REF="002841_0031_0FE675073050D1F8">
Iniquity does abound exceedingly among&s;t us; yet it mu&s;t be acknowledged to the glory of di|vine Grace &amp; Mercy, that there is a Number of &s;erious godly, praying Ones among us, who weep and mourn Day and Night for the Iniquities and Abominations, that are in the mid&s;t of us; and are zealou&s;ly concerned for the revival of the work of the LORD, and the promoting of Peace, and Godline&s;s, and Hone&s;ty. The&s;e are the Cha|riots of our I&s;rael, and the Hor&s;emen thereof.</P>
<P>And it is to be looked upon as a Token for good, that &s;o many are &s;pirited to lay out part of their E&s;tates, to give their hopeful Sons a liberal Education; and that &s;o many of tho&s;e who are &s;o Educated, are Spirited to give up them&s;elves to the work of the Mini&s;try, when the Mini&s;try is under &s;uch dark &amp; di&s;couraging circum&s;tances, that they cannot have any pro&s;pect of advancing their worldly Intere&s;t by engaging in that work. It looks as if they were acted by a more noble and generous principle; that it is a de&s;ire to be in|&s;trumental of promoting Religion &amp; Godline&s;s, that carries them out to undertake &s;o good a work; May the GOD of all Grace be with them, and fill them more abundantly with his Spirit &amp; Grace, that when the Aged Servants of the Lord, and tho&s;e who are in our declining Years &s;hall be called off from our work, we may leave it with a joyful pro&s;pect of this, that our Places are like to be filled up with tho&s;e who will do more to promote true Godline&s;s, than ever we have done.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="002841_0032_0FE674E812E22AE0">USE 3. <HI>Hence we may learn, That Rulers &s;hould be Men of Prayer.</HI> They &s;hould Pray much and often to GOD, if their work be of &s;uch weight and concernment; that their People ought to Pray much for them. Certainly they ought to Pray much for them&s;elves, and for their People too. And tho&s;e of them who are &s;en&s;ible of the weight and Difficulty of their work, will be much in Prayer. King <HI>David</HI> was a Man of Prayer: He re&s;olved that Evening and Morning and at Noon he would pray, and cry aloud unto GOD, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 55 17. And how earne&s;t did <HI>Solomon</HI> pray for Wi&s;dom, to know how to go in and out before his Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ple? And <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did not only pray much for him&s;elf, but was al&s;o a powerful Interce&s;&s;or for his People.

<P>USE 4. <HI>What hath been &s;aid may be improved for the Direction of tho&s;e concerned in the Elections of this Day.</HI> You have often heard what a great Tru&s;t is repo&s;ed in you by GOD &amp; Men, who are to make choice of many of tho&s;e who are to be Rulers over this People, and certainly you ought to be true to your Tru&s;t, and do what you may be able to give a good account of to your glorious Judge. And not act herein meerly to &s;erve your own private I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tere&s;t or to &s;erve any party; but &s;incerely to make choice of &s;uch as will be mo&s;t

And &s;o to choo&s;e &s;uch as are not only able Men, Men that are able to choo&s;e out our way; but al&s;o that have the Intere&s;t of Religion lying much upon their hearts, and will improve all their Op|portunities &amp; Advantages to promote Peace and Godline&s;s, and Hone&s;ty among this People.</P>
<P>USE 5. <HI>Let us hence be excited to Pray much for our Rulers, for all that are, or may be &s;et up in Authority over us.</HI> We hear that this is our Duty, Let not any be negligent in it; but let all of us pray without cea&s;ing for them, and that with the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s and importunity, unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an affecting &s;en&s;e of the weightine&s;s and difficulty of their work. Let us be often &s;triving together in our prayers for them, as well as pray for them alone by our &s;elves. This would better become us than to be too forward to complain of them, and murmur again&s;t them. And if we would pray more for them, it may be we &s;hould not have &s;o much occa&s;ion to complain of them. If they at any time do what they &s;hould not do, or neglect to do what they &s;hould do; it may be we are to blame. If we had prayed for them as we &s;hould have done, perhaps it would have been otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>USE 6. <HI>Let us be excited by what we have heard, to Gratitude and Thankfulne&s;s to GOD.</HI> Let us ble&s;s and prai&s;e GOD who hath given us a KING who hath been &s;o zealous to &s;ecure and promote the Prote&s;tant Religion, and to &s;uppre&s;s

But this is what was in&s;i&s;ted on in the la&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e you were entertained with on this occa&s;ion: And therefore I &s;hall not any further enlarge upon it.</P>
<P>USE 7. <HI>Let us all be excited by what we have heard, to labour, and do our utmo&s;t, in our &s;everal Places to promote Peace and Piety, and Hone&s;ty among this People.</HI> Seeing this will be &s;o much for the Glory of GOD, and the Good and Benefit of this People.

<P N="1">1. In an humble Addre&s;s to his HONOUR, our Commander in Chief, The <HI>Honourable Council,</HI> and the <HI>Honoured</HI> Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives.</P>

<P>And here,</P>
<P>Let it be &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered, Whether the Mul|tiplying of Hou&s;es that are Licen&s;ed to Sell Strong Drink be not the occa&s;ion of a great deal of Sin.

<P>And what Obligations are the Rulers of this People under, to &s;ee to it, that the Wor&s;hip of GOD and the Ordinances of CHRIST be attended upon, and improved according to Divine Pre&s;cription,

This is the work which we are &s;eparated and &s;et apart unto, and very awfully and dread|fully Charged to do, <HI>viz</HI> to promote Peace and Godline&s;s, and Hone&s;ty among our People; and &s;eeing it is &s;o de&s;irable a thing for a People to lead &s;uch lives, and will conduce &s;o much to the Glory of GOD, and the good of his People, how &s;hould we labour and &s;pend our&s;elves to promote them not only by Praying for our Civil Rulers, and encouraging them to go on &s;teddily and zea|lou&s;ly with their work; but al&s;o by applying our &s;elves to that which is our proper work. That if po&s;&s;ible in this Day of Degeneracy the work of the Lord may be revived, and many may have their eyes opened, and be turned from darkne&s;s

to light, and from the Power of Sin and Satan unto GOD; that Bold and daring Sinners may turn their Feet into the way of GOD's Te&s;ti|monies, and the Profe&s;&s;ors of Religion may be &s;ound in GOD's Statutes, and &s;tedfa&s;t in his Co|venant, and adorn the Doctrine of GOD their Saviour in all things; and the things which are ready to die may be &s;trengthned. And to that End, labour in the mo&s;t lively and affecting man|ner to &s;et forth unto them their Mi&s;ery by Na|ture, the vilene&s;s of Sin, the Vanity of the Crea|ture, and the Excellency of CHRIST. And with the greate&s;t Importunity cry to the GOD of all Grace, for the plentiful effu&s;ion of his Spirit and Grace, that it may be a Day of his Power where|in very many may be made willing to come over to CHRIST, and walk in his ways, and uphold Religion in the Life &amp; Power of it. And dili|gently and faithfully attend upon every part of our work, depending upon GOD for A&s;&s;i&s;tance therein, and Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>Indeed, many are labouring under &s;uch diffi|culties that they cannot give them&s;elves to this work, as they &s;hould do, and would do. Altho' they are wronged and injured; yet, People who are quick &s;ighted in other Ca&s;es will not &s;ee it, and therefore they are not relieved; yet let all, as far as po&s;&s;ibly they can, improve their Time, and all their Talents to promote Peace and God|line&s;s, depending upon GOD, not only for A&s;|&s;i&s;tance and Succe&s;s; but for a Maintenance, who is able to open the Eyes and Hearts of People. It is a Good GOD that we &s;erve, and he will not
<PB N="35" REF="002841_0038_0FE674EEAE98CD70">
fail any that Tru&s;t in him. He hath a glorious Reward for all that will &s;erve him faithfully.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The&s;e Truths may be improved in a loud Call to the Body of this People.</HI> You hear how much our living in Peace, and in the Practice of Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty would tend to the Glo|ry of GOD. And how much it would be for our own Honour and Safety. O, that you would all do what you po&s;&s;ibly can for the promoting of it, and that not only by praying for, and ho|nouring and &s;upporting our Rulers, and by in|forming and te&s;tifying again&s;t Bold Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ors, and by encouraging the hearts, and &s;trength|ning the hands of your Mini&s;ters: but al&s;o by labouring to uphold and maintain the life and power of Godline&s;s in your own Souls, and promo|ting it as much as you can in your Families.</P>
<P>And &s;o all Heads of Families are to be called upon, to endeavour the Revival of Family Religion and Family Government. There is nothing more nece&s;&s;ary than this at this Day. For, as one well ob&s;erves, If a People have the be&s;t Magi|&s;trates, and they Enact the be&s;t Laws, and back them with the &s;tricte&s;t Execution; yet So|cieties will be naught, if Heads of Families neg|lect their Duty. They have the Care of Per&s;ons in their young and tender Years, when they may be bowed; but if they neglect them till they grow up, they are like to be unmanageable; and &s;o to be plagues to the Places where they dwell. It is very probable that at this Door, that Apo|&s;tacy and Degeneracy came in which hath aw|fully crept upon this People, and hath been
<PB N="36" REF="002841_0039_0FE6750ED8CAEC80">
te&s;tified again&s;t, by &s;o many amazing Judgments and Calamities. And if ever this People become a truly reformed People there mu&s;t be a Revival of Family Religion, Family In&s;truction and Fa|mily Government. I &s;hall therefore Conclude with a Call to all Heads of Families, to walk within their Hou&s;es with a perfect Heart. Set up and maintain the Wor&s;hip of GOD in your Families con&s;tantly. Take pains in teaching and in&s;tructing all that are under your Care, and Go|vern your Families well.</P>
<P>And if All &s;orts of Per&s;ons would unite their active and zealous Endeavours, with Prudence and Fidelity, to &s;uppre&s;s Sin and Wickedne&s;s and promote the contrary, we &s;hould &s;oon come to live in Peace, and in the due Exerci&s;e &amp; Prac|tice of all true Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty. And then &s;hould we pro&s;per in all our Undertakings, and &s;ee Good according to the Years wherein we have &s;een Evil; Glory al&s;o would dwell in our Land. And we &s;hould have occa&s;ion to rai&s;e that note of Triumph, <HI>The Lord of HOST is with us, The GOD of Jacob is our Refuge,</HI> Selah.</P>
