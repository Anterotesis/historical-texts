<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the &s;ub&s;equent Letters were written by a tender father, in a declining &s;tate of health, for the in&s;truction of his daughters, and not intended for the Public, is a circum&s;tance which will recommend them to every one who con&s;iders them in the light of admonition and advice. In &s;uch dome&s;tic intercour&s;e, no &s;acrifices are made to pre|judices, to cu&s;toms, to fa&s;hionable opinions. Pa|ternal love, paternal care, &s;peak their genuine &s;enti|ments, undi&s;gui&s;ed and unre&s;trained. A father's zeal for his daughter's improvement, in whatever can make a woman amiable, with a father's quick apprehen&s;ion of the dangers that too often ari&s;e, even from the attainment of that very point, &s;ugge&s;t his admonitions, and render him attentive to a thou&s;and little graces and little decorums, which would e&s;cape the nice&s;t morali&s;t who &s;hould undertake the &s;ubject on unintere&s;ted &s;peculation. Every faculty is on the alarm, when the objects of &s;uch tender affection are concerned.</P>
<P>In the writer of the&s;e Letters paternal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and vigilance were doubted, as he was at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ole parent; death having before deprived, the young ladies of their excellent mother. His own precarious &s;tate of health in&s;pired him with the mo&s;t tender &s;olicitude for their future welfare; and though he might have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> that the impre&s;&s;i|on
<PB N="viii" REF="025067_0005_0FCE4A067279DC18">
on made by his in&s;truction and uniform example could never be effaced from the memory of his chil|dren, yet his anxiety for their orphan condition &s;ug|ge&s;ted to him this method of continuing to them tho&s;e advantages.</P>
<P>The Editor is encouraged to offer this Treati&s;e to the Public, by the very favourable reception which the re&s;t of his father's works have met with. The Comparative View of the State of Man and other Animals, and the E&s;&s;ay on the Office and Du|ties of a Phy&s;ician, have been very generally read; and, if he is not deceived by the partiality of his friends, he has rea&s;on to believe they have met with general approbation.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of tho&s;e tracts the Author's object was to improve the ta&s;te and under&s;tanding of his reader; in others, to mend his heart; in others, to point out to him the proper u&s;e of philo&s;ophy, by &s;hewing its application to the duties of common life. In all his writings his chief view was the good of his fellow-creatures; and as tho&s;e among his friends, in who&s;e ta&s;te and judgment he mo&s;t confided, think the pub|lication of this &s;mall work will contribute to that general de&s;ign, and at the &s;ame time do honour to his memory, the Editor can no longer he&s;itate to com|ply with their advice in communicating it to the Public.</P>

<HEAD>A FATHER's LEGACY TO HIS DAUGHTERS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR GIRLS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU had the mi&s;fortune to be deprived of your mother at a time of life when you were in&s;en&s;ible of your lo&s;s, and could receive little be|nefit either from her in&s;truction or her example. Before this comes to your hands, you will likewi&s;e have lo&s;t your father.</P>
<P>I have had many melancholy reflections on the forlorn and helple&s;s &s;ituation you mu&s;t be in, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> it &s;hould plea&s;e God to remove me from you, before you arrive at that period of life when you will be able to think and act for your&s;elves. I know mankind too well: I know their fal&s;e|hood, their di&s;&s;ipation, their coldne&s;s to all the duties of friend&s;hip and humanity. I know the little attention paid to helple&s;s infancy. You will meet with few friends di&s;intere&s;ted enough to do you good offices, when you are incapable of making them any return, by contributing to their intere&s;t or their plea&s;ure, or even to the gratification of their vanity.</P>
<P>I have been &s;upported under the gloom natu|rally ari&s;ing from the&s;e reflections, by a reliance on the goodne&s;s of that Providence which has hi|therto
<PB N="11" REF="025067_0008_0FCE49D59D7CACF0">
pre&s;erved you, and given me the mo&s;t plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of the goodne&s;s of your di&s;po|&s;itions; and by the &s;ecret hope that your mother's virtues will entail a ble&s;&s;ing on her children.</P>
<P>The anxiety I have for your happine&s;s, has made me re&s;olve to throw together my &s;entiments relating to your future conduct in life. If I live for &s;ome years, you will receive them with much greater ad|vantage, &s;uited to your different geniu&s;es and di&s;po|&s;itions. If I die &s;ooner, you mu&s;t receive them in this very imperfect manner,&mdash;the la&s;t proof of my affection.</P>
<P>You will all remember your father's fondne&s;s, when perhaps every other circum&s;tance relating to him is forgotten. This remembrance, I hope, will induce you to give a &s;erious attention to the advices I am now going to leave with you. I can reque&s;t this attention with the greater confi|dence, as my &s;entiments on the mo&s;t intere&s;ting points that regard life and manners, were entire|ly corre&s;pondent to your mother's who&s;e judg|ment and ta&s;te I tru&s;ted much more than my own.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t expect that the advices which I &s;hall give you will be very imperfect, as there are many namele&s;s delicacies in female manners of which none but a woman can judge. You will have one advantage by attending to what I am going to leave with you; you will hear, at lea&s;t for once in your lives, the ginuine &s;entiments of a man who has no intere&s;t in flattering or deceiv|ing you. I &s;hall throw my reflections together without any &s;tudied order, and &s;hall only, avoid confu&s;ion, range them under a few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>You will &s;ee, in a little Treati&s;e of mine ju&s;t

publi&s;hed, in what an honourable point of view I have con&s;idered your &s;ex; not as dome&s;tic dru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">es, or the &s;laves of our plea&s;ures, but as our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">mpanions and equals; as de&s;igned to &s;often our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and poli&s;h our manners; and as Thom&s;on finely &s;ays,

<L>And &s;weeten all the toils <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> human life.</L></Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall not repeat what I have there &s;aid on this &s;ubject, and &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that from the view I have given of your natural character and place in &s;ociety, there ari&s;es a certain pro|priety of conduct peculiar to your &s;ex. It is this peculiar propriety of female manners of which I intend to give you my &s;entiments, without touch|ing on tho&s;e general rules o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> conduct by which men and women are equally bound.</P>
<P>While I explain to you that &s;y&s;tem of conduct which I think will tend mo&s;t to your honour and happine&s;s, I &s;hall, at the &s;ame time, endeavour to point out tho&s;e virtues and accompli&s;hments which render you mo&s;t re&s;pectable and mo&s;t amia|ble in the eyes of my own &s;ex.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the duties of religion, &s;trictly &s;peaking, are equally binding on both &s;exes, yet certain differences in their natural character and education, render &s;ome vices in your &s;ex par|ticularly odious. The natural hardne&s;s of our hearts, and &s;trength of our pa&s;&s;ions, inflamed by the uncontrouled licence we are too often indulged with in our youth, are apt to render our manners
<PB N="13" REF="025067_0010_0FCE49D76E603910">
more di&s;&s;olute, and make us le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of the finer feelings of the heart. Your &s;uperior delicacy, your mode&s;ty, and the u&s;ual &s;everity of your education, pre&s;erve you, in a great mea&s;ure, from any temptation to tho&s;e vices to which we are mo&s;t &s;ubjected. The natural &s;oftne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility of your di&s;po&s;itions particularly &s;it you for the practice of tho&s;e duties where the heart is chiefly concerned. And this, along with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|tural warmth of your imagination, renders you peculiarly &s;u&s;ceptible of the feelings of devotion.</P>
<P>There are many circum&s;tances in your &s;ituation that peculiarly require the &s;upports of religion to enable you to act in them with &s;pirit and pro|priety. Your whole life is often a life of &s;uffer|ing. You cannot plunge into bu&s;ine&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;&s;i|pate your&s;elves in plea&s;ure and riot, as men too often do, when under the pre&s;&s;ure of misfortunes. You mu&s;t bear your &s;orrows in &s;ilence, unknown and unpitied. You mu&s;t often put on a face of &s;erenity and cheerfulne&s;s, when your hearts are torn with angui&s;h, or &s;inking in de&s;pair. Then your only re&s;ource is in the con&s;olations of reli|gion. It is chiefly owing to the&s;e, that you bear dome&s;tic misfortunes better than we do.</P>
<P>But you are &s;ometimes in very different circum|&s;tances, that equally require the re&s;traints of re|ligion. The natural vivacity, and perhaps the natural vanity of your &s;ex, is very apt to lead you into a di&s;&s;ipated &s;tate of life that deceives you, under the appearance of innocent plea&s;ure; but which in reality wa&s;tes you, &s;pirits, impairs your health, weakens all the &s;uperior facultie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of your minds, and often fullies your reputations. Religion, by checking this di&s;&s;ipation, and rage for plea&s;ure, enables you to draw more happi|ne&s;s
<PB N="14" REF="025067_0011_0FCE4A0DE1F56BA0">
even from tho&s;e very &s;ources of amu&s;ement, which, when too frequently applied to, are often productive of &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>Religion is rather a matter of &s;entiment than rea|&s;oning. The important and intere&s;ting articles of faith are &s;ufficiently plain. Fix your attention on the&s;e, and do not meddle with controver&s;y. If you get into that, you plunge into a chaos, from which you will never be able to extricate your&s;elves. It &s;poils the temper, and, I &s;u&s;pect, has no good effect on the hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>Avoid all books and all conver&s;ation that tend to &s;hake your faith on tho&s;e great points of religion which &s;hould &s;erve to regulate your conduct, and on which your hopes of future and eternal happine&s;s depend.</P>
<P>Never indulge your&s;elves in ridicule on reli|gious &s;ubjects, nor give countenance to it in others by &s;eeming diverted with what they &s;ay. This, to people of good-breeding, will be a &s;ufficient check.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you to go no further than the Scriptures for your religious opinions. Embrace tho&s;e you find clearly revealed. Never perplex your&s;elves about &s;uch as you do not under&s;tand, but treat them with &s;ilent and becoming reverence. I would advi&s;e you to read only &s;uch religious books as are addre&s;&s;ed to the heart, &s;uch as in&s;pire pious and devout affections, &s;uch as are proper to direct you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in your conduct, and not &s;uch as tend to entangle you in the endle&s;s maze of opinions and &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P>Be punctual in the &s;tated performance of your private devotions, morning and evening. If you have any &s;en&s;ibility or imagination, this will e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch an intercour&s;e between you and the
<PB N="15" REF="025067_0012_0FCE49D8CF2C23D8">
Supreme Being, as will be of infinite con&s;equence to you in life. It will communicate an habitual cheerfulne&s;s to your tempers, give a firmne&s;s and &s;teadine&s;s to your virtue, and enable you to go through all the vici&s;&s;itudes of human life with propriety and dignity.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h you to be regular in your attendance on public wor&s;hip, and in receiving the communion. Allow nothing to interrupt your public or private devotions, except the performance of &s;ome active duty in life, to which they &s;hould always give place. In your behaviour at public wor&s;hip, ob|&s;erve an exemplary attention and gravity.</P>
<P>That extreme &s;trictne&s;s which I recommend to you in the&s;e duties, will be con&s;idered by many of your acquaintance as a &s;uper&s;titious attach|ment to forms; but in the advices I give you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> on this and other &s;ubjects, I have an eye to the &s;pirit and manners of the age. There is a levity and di&s;&s;ipation in the pre&s;ent manners, a coldne&s;s and li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s in whatever relates to religion which can|not fail to infect you, unle&s;s you purpo&s;ely cultivate in your minds a contrary bias, and make the devoti|onal ta&s;te habitual.</P>
<P>Avoid all grimace and o&s;tentation in your re|ligious duties. They are the u&s;ual cloaks of hy|procri&s;y; at lea&s;t they &s;hew a weak and vain mind.</P>
<P>Do not make religion a &s;ubject of common conver&s;ation in mixed companies. When it is introduced, rather &s;eem to decline it. At the &s;ame time, never &s;uffer any per&s;on to in&s;ult you by any fooli&s;h ribaldry on your religious opi|nions, but &s;hew the &s;ame re&s;entment you would naturally do on being offered any other per&s;onal in&s;ult. But the &s;ure&s;t way to avoid this, is by
<PB N="16" REF="025067_0013_0FCE4A12C904F9A8">
a mode&s;t re&s;erve on the &s;ubject, and by u&s;ing no freedom with others about their religious &s;enti|ments.</P>
<P>Cultivate an enlarged charity for all mankind, however they may differ from you in their reli|gious opinions. That difference may probably ari&s;e from cau&s;es in which you had no &s;hare, and from which you can derive to merit.</P>
<P>Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w your regard to religion by a di&s;tingui&s;hing re&s;pect to all its mini&s;ters, of whatever per&s;ua&s;ion who do not by their lives di&s;honour their profe&s;|&s;ion; but never allow them the direction of your con&s;ciences, left they taint you with the narrow &s;pirit of their party.</P>
<P>The be&s;t effect of your religion will be a dif|fu&s;ive humanity to all in di&s;tre&s;s. Set apart a certain proportion of your income as &s;acred to charitable purpo&s;es. But in this, as well as in the practice of every other duty, carefully avoid o&s;tentation. Vanity is always defeating her own purpo&s;es. Fame is one of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tural rewards of virtue. Do not pur&s;ue her, and &s;he will follow you.</P>
<P>Do not confine your charity to giving money. You may have many opportunities of &s;hewing a tender and compa&s;&s;ionate &s;pirit where your mo|ney is not wanted. There is a fal&s;e and unna|tural refinement in &s;en&s;ibility, which makes &s;ome people &s;hun the &s;ight of every object in di&s;|tre&s;s. Never indulge this, e&s;pecially where your friends or acquaintances are concerned. Let the days of there misfortunes, when the world forgets or avoids them, be the &s;ea&s;on for you to exerci&s;e your humanity and friend&s;hip, the &s;ight of human mi&s;ery &s;oftens the heart, and makes it better: it checks the pride of health and pro&s;pe|rity,
<PB N="17" REF="025067_0014_0FCE49DBC6BA88C0">
and the di&s;tre&s;s it occa&s;ions is amply com|pen&s;ated by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doing your duty, and by the &s;ecret endearment which nature has annexed to all our &s;ympathetic &s;orrows.</P>
<P>Women are greatly deceived, when they think they recommend them&s;elves to our &s;ex by their indifference about religion. Even tho&s;e men who are them&s;elves unbelievers, di&s;like infidelity in you. Every man who knows human nature, connects a religious ta&s;te in your &s;ex with &s;oft|ne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility of heart; at lea&s;t we always con&s;ider the want of it as a proof of that hard and ma&s;culine &s;pirit, which of all your faults we di&s;|like the mo&s;t. Be&s;ides, men con&s;ider your reli|gion as one of their principal &s;ecurities for that female virtue in which they are mo&s;t intere&s;ted. If a gentleman pretends an attachment to any of you, and endeavours to &s;hake your religious principles, be a&s;&s;ured he is either a fool, or has de&s;igns on you which he dares not openly avow.</P>
<P>You will probably wonder at my having edu|cated you in a church different from my own. The rea&s;on was plainly this: I looked on the differences between our churches to be of no real importance, and that a preference of one to the other was a mere matter of ta&s;te. Your mother was educated in the Church of England, and had an attachment to it, and I had a prejudice in favour of every thing &s;he liked. It never was her de&s;ire that you &s;hould be bapti&s;ed by a cler|gyman of the Church of England, or be educated in that Church. On the contrary, the delicacy of her regard to the &s;malle&s;t circum&s;tance that could affect me in the eye of the world, made her anxiou&s;ly in&s;i&s;t it might be otherwi&s;e. But I could not yield to her in that kind of genero&s;ity.
<PB N="18" REF="025067_0015_0FCE4A13E2CD7838">
When I lo&s;t her, I became &s;till more determined to educate you in that Church, as I feel a &s;ecret plea|&s;ure in doing every thing that appears to me to ex|pre&s;s my affection and veneration for her memory. I draw but a very faint and imperfect picture of what your mother was, while I endeavour to point out what you &s;hould be<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader will remember, that &s;uch ob&s;erva|tions as re&s;pect equally both the &s;exes, are all along as much as po&s;&s;ible avoided.</NOTE>.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>CONDUCT and BEHAVIOUR.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the chief beauties in a female character, is that mode&s;t re&s;erve, that retiring delicacy, which avoids the public eye, and is di&s;concerted even at the gaze of admiration.&mdash;I do not wi&s;h you to be in&s;en&s;ible to applau&s;e; if you were, you mu&s;t become, if not wor&s;e, at lea&s;t le&s;s amiable women: but you may be dazzled by that admiration which yet rejoices your hearts.</P>
<P>When a girl cea&s;es to blu&s;h, &s;he has lo&s;t the mo&s;t powerful charm of beauty. That extreme &s;en&s;ibility which it indicates, may be a weakne&s;s and incumbrance in our &s;ex, as I have too often felt; but in yours it is peculiarly engaging. Pe|dants, who think them&s;elves philo&s;ophers, a&s;k why a woman &s;hould blu&s;h when &s;he is con&s;cious of no crime? It is a &s;ufficient an&s;wer, that Na|ture has made you to blu&s;h when you are guilty of no fault, and has forced us to love you becau&s;e you do &s;o.&mdash;Blu&s;hing is &s;o far from being nece&s;&s;arily an attendant on guilt, that it is the u&s;ual companion of innocence.</P>
<P>This mode&s;ty, which I think &s;o e&s;&s;ential in
<PB N="19" REF="025067_0016_0FCE49DD27FA0628">
your &s;ex, will naturally di&s;po&s;e you to be rather &s;i|lent in company, e&s;pecially in a large one.&mdash;Peo|ple of &s;en&s;e, and di&s;cernment will never mi&s;take &s;uch &s;ilence for dulne&s;s. One may take a &s;hare in con|ver&s;ation without uttering a &s;yllable. The expre&s;|&s;ion in the countenance &s;hews it, and this never e&s;|capes an ob&s;erving eye.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad that you had an ea&s;y dignity in your behaviour at public places, but not that confident ea&s;e, that unaba&s;hed countenance, which &s;eems to &s;et the company at defiance. If, while a gentleman is &s;peaking to you, one of &s;uperior rank addre&s;&s;es you, do not let your eager atten|tion and vi&s;ible preference betray the flutter of your heart: let your pride on this occa&s;ion pre|&s;erve you from that meanne&s;s into which your vanity would &s;ink you.

<P>Wit is the mo&s;t dangerous talent you can po&s;|&s;e&s;s. It mu&s;t be guarded with great di&s;cretion and good nature, otherwi&s;e it will create you many enemies. Wit is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with &s;oftne&s;s and delicacy; yet they are &s;eldom found united. Wit is &s;o flattering to vanity, that they who po&s;&s;e&s;s it become intoxicated, and lo&s;e all &s;elf-command.</P>

delicacy, and a &s;till greater one to dignity of cha|racter. It may &s;ometimes gain you applau&s;e, but will never procure you re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Be even cautious in di&s;playing your good &s;en&s;e. It will be thought you a&s;&s;ume a &s;uperiority over the re&s;t of the company. But if you happen to have any learning, keep it a profound &s;ecret, e&s;pecially from the men, who generally look with a jealous and malignant eye on a woman of great parts, amd a cultivated under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>A man of real genius and candour is far &s;upe|rior to this meanne&s;s; but &s;uch a one will &s;eldom fall in your way; and if by accident he &s;hould, do not be anxious to &s;hew the full extent of your knowledge. If he has any opportunities of &s;ee|ing you, he will &s;oon di&s;cover it him&s;elf; and if you have any advantages of per&s;on or manner, and keep your own &s;ecret, he will probably give you credit for a great deal more than you po&s;&s;e&s;s, The great art of plea&s;ing in conver&s;ation con&s;i&s;ts in making the company plea&s;ed with them&s;elves. You will more readily hear them talk your&s;elves into their good graces.</P>
<P>Beware of detraction, e&s;pecially where your own &s;ex are concerned. You are generally ac|cu&s;ed of being particularly addicted to this vice&mdash;I think, unjustly. Men are fully as guilty of it when their intere&s;ts interfere.

<P>Con&s;ider every &s;pecies of indelicacy in conver|&s;ation, as &s;hameful in it&s;elf, and as highly di&s;|gu&s;ting to us. All double entendre is of this fort. The di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of men's education al|lows them to be diverted with a kind of wit, which yet they have delicacy enough to be &s;hock|ed at, when it comes from your mouths, or even when you hear it without pain and contempt.&mdash;Virgin purity is of that delicate nature, that it cannot hear certain things without contammation. It is always in your power to avoid the&s;e. No man but a brute or a fool will in&s;ult a woman with conver&s;ation which he &s;ees gives her pain; nor will he dare to do it, if &s;he re&s;ent the injury with a becoming &s;pirit. There is a dignity in con&s;cious virtue which is able to awe the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s and a|bandoned of men.</P>
<P>You will be reproached perhaps with prudery. By prudery is u&s;ually meant an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> affectation of delicacy: Now I do not wi&s;h you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o affect delica|cy; I wi&s;h you to po&s;&s;e&s;s it: at any rate it is bet|ter to run the ri&s;k of being thought ridiculous than di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>The men will complain of your re&s;erve. They will a&s;&s;ure you that a franker behaviour would make you more amiable. But, tru&s;t me, they are not &s;incere when they tell you &s;o. I acknow|ledge, that on &s;ome occa&s;ions it might render you more agreeable as campanions, but it would make you le&s;s amiable as women&mdash;an important di&s;|tinction, which many of your &s;ex are not aware of
<PB N="22" REF="025067_0019_0FCE4A18F37704B0">
After all, I wi&s;h you to have great ea&s;e and open|ne&s;s in your conver&s;ation; I only point out &s;ome con&s;iderations which ought to regulate your behavi|our in that re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Have a &s;acred regard to truth. Lying is a mean and de&s;picable vice. I have known &s;ome women of excellent parts, who were &s;o much ad|dicted to it, that they could not be tru&s;ted in the re|lation of any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> e&s;pecially if it contained any thing of the marvellous, or if they them&s;elves were the heroines of the tale. This weakne&s;s did not proceed from a bad heart, but was merely the effect of vanity, or an unbridled imagination. I do not mean to cen&s;ure that lively embelli&s;hment of a hu|morous &s;tory, which is only intended to promote in|nocent mirth.</P>
<P>There is a certain gentlene&s;s of &s;pirit and man|ners extremely engaging in your &s;ex; not that indi&s;criminate attention, that unmeaning &s;imper, which &s;miles on all alike. This ari&s;es either from an affectation of &s;oftne&s;s, or from perfect in&s;ipidity.</P>
<P>There is a &s;pecies of refinement in luxury, ju&s;t beginning to prevail among the gentlemen of this country, to which our ladies are yet as great &s;tran|gers as any women upon earth; I hope, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the &s;ex, they may ever continue &s;o; I mean, the luxury of eating. It is a de&s;picable &s;el|fi&s;h vice in men, but in your &s;ex it is beyond expre&s;|&s;ion indelicate and di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>Every one who remembers a few years back, is &s;en&s;ible of a very &s;triking change in the atten|tion and re&s;pect formerly paid by the gentlemen to the ladies; their drawing rooms are de&s;erted, and after dinner and &s;upper the gentleman are impatient till they retire. How they came to lo&s;e this re&s;pect, which nature and politene&s;s &s;o
<PB N="23" REF="025067_0020_0FCE49E0DCD9B248">
well entitle them to, I &s;hall not here particularly inquire. The revolutions of manners in any coun|try depend on cau&s;es very various and complicat|ed. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the behaviour of the ladies in the la&s;t age was very re&s;erved and &s;tately. I would now be reckoned ridiculou&s;ly &s;tiff and formal. Whatever it was, it had cer|tainly the effect of making them more re&s;pected.</P>
<P>A fine woman, like other fine things in nature, has her proper point of view, from which &s;he may be &s;een to mo&s;t advantage. To fix this point requires great judgement, and an intimate know|ledge of the human heart. By the pre&s;ent mode of female manners, the ladies &s;eem to expect that they &s;hall regain their a&s;cendency over us, by the fulle&s;t di&s;play of their per&s;onal charms, by being always in our eye at public places, by conver|&s;ing with us with the &s;ame unre&s;erved freedom as we do with one another; in &s;hort, by re&s;embling us as nearly as they po&s;&s;ibly can.&mdash;But a little time and experience will &s;how the folly of this expectation and conduct.</P>
<P>The power of a fine woman over the hearts of men, of men of the fine&s;t parts, is even beyond what &s;he conceives. They are &s;en&s;ible of the plea&s;ing illu&s;i|on, but they cannot, nor do they wi&s;h to di&s;&s;olve it. But if &s;he is determined to di&s;pel the charm; it cer|tainly is in her power; &s;he may &s;oon reduce the an|gel to a very ordinary girl.</P>
<P>There is a native dignity in ingenuous mode&s;ty to be expected in your &s;ex, which is your natural protection from the familarities of the men, and which you &s;hould feel previous to the reflection that it is your intere&s;t to keep your&s;elves &s;acred from all per&s;onal freedoms. The many name|le&s;s charms and endearments of beauty &s;hould be re&s;erved to ble&s;s the arms of the happy man to
<PB N="24" REF="025067_0021_0FCE4A1C393D0BB0">
whom you give your heart, but who, if he has the lea&s;t delicacy, will de&s;pi&s;e them if he knows that they have been pro&s;tituted to fifty men before him. The &s;entiment, that a woman may allow all innocent freedoms, provided her virtue is &s;ecure, is both gro&s;sly indelicate and dangerous, and has proved fa|tal to many of your &s;ex.</P>
<P>Let me now recommend to your attention that elegance, which is not &s;o much a quality it&s;elf, as the high poli&s;h of every other. It is what diffu&s;es an ineffable grace over every look, every motion, every &s;entence you utter; it gives that charm to beauty, without which it generally fails to plea&s;e. It is partly a per&s;onal quality, in which re&s;pect it is the gift of nature; but I &s;peak of it principally as a quality of the mind. In a word, it is the per|fection of ta&s;te in life and manners;&mdash;every virtue and every excellency in their mo&s;t graceful and amiable forms.</P>
<P>You may perhaps think that I want to throw every &s;park of nature out of your compo&s;ition, and to make you entirely artificial. Far from it. I wi&s;h you to po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t perfect &s;implicity of heart and manners.

<HEAD>AMUSEMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY period of life has amu&s;ements which are natural and proper to it. You may in|dulge the variety of your ta&s;tes in the&s;e, while
<PB N="25" REF="025067_0022_0FCE49E1A12C6A98">
you keep within the bounds of that propriety which is &s;uitable to your &s;ex.</P>
<P>Some amu&s;ements are conductive to health, as various kinds of exerci&s;e; &s;ome are connected with qualities really u&s;eful, as different kinds of women's work, and all the dome&s;tic concerns of a family; &s;ome are elegant accompli&s;hments, as dre&s;s, dancing, mu&s;ic, and drawing. Such books as improve your under&s;tanding, enlarge your know|ledge, and cultivate your ta&s;te, may be con&s;idered in a higher point of view than mere amu&s;ements. There are a variety of others, which are neither u&s;eful nor ornamental, &s;uch as play of different kinds.</P>
<P>I would particularly recommend to you tho&s;e exerci&s;es that oblige you to be much abroad in the open air, &s;uch as walking and riding on hor&s;e|back. This will give vigour to your con&s;titutions, and a bloom to your complexions. If you ac|cu&s;tom your&s;elves to go abroad always in chairs and carriages, you will &s;oon become &s;o enervated, as to be unable to go out of doors without them. They are like mo&s;t articles of luxury, u&s;eful and agreeable when judiciou&s;ly u&s;ed; but when made habitual, they become both in&s;ipid and pernicious.</P>
<P>An attention to your health is a duty you owe to your&s;elves and to your friends. Bad health &s;el|dom fails to have an influence on the &s;pirits and temper. The fine&s;t geniu&s;es, the mo&s;t delicate minds, have very frequently a corre&s;pondent delica|cy of bodily con&s;titution, which they are too apt to neglect. Their luxury lies in reading and late hours, equal enemies to health and beauty.</P>
<P>But though good health be one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of life, never make a boa&s;t of it, but enjoy it in grateful &s;ilence. We &s;o naturally a&s;|&s;ociate
<PB N="26" REF="025067_0023_0FCE4A1DA52A5BC8">
the idea of female &s;oftne&s;s and delicacy with a corre&s;pondent delicacy of con&s;titution, that when a woman &s;peaks of her great &s;trength, her extraordinary appetite, her ability to bear exce&s;|&s;ive fatigue, we recoil at the de&s;cription in a way &s;he is little aware of.</P>
<P>The intention of your being taught needle|work, knitting, and &s;uch like, is not on account of the intrin&s;ic value of all you can do with your hands, which is trifling, but to enable you to judge more perfectly of that kind of work, and to direct the execution of it in others. Another principal end is to enable you to fill up, in a to|lerably agreeable way, &s;ome of the many &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ltary hours you mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s at home. It is a great article in the happine&s;s of life, to have your plea&s;ures as independent of others as po&s;&s;ible. By continually gadding abroad in &s;earch of amu&s;e|ment, you lo&s;e the re&s;pect of all your acquain|tances, whom you oppre&s;s with tho&s;e vi&s;its, which, by a more di&s;creet management, might have been courted.</P>
<P>The dome&s;tic oeconomy of a family is entirely a woman's province, and furni&s;hes a variety of &s;ubjects for the exertion both of good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ence and good ta&s;te. If you ever come to have the charge of a family, it ought to engage much of your time and attention; nor can you be excu&s;ed from this by any extent of fortune, though with a narrow one the ruin that follows the neglect of it may be more immediate.</P>
<P>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the greate&s;t lo&s;s what to advi&s;e you in regard to books. There is no impropriety in your reading hi&s;tory, or cultivating any art or &s;cience to which genius or accident lead you. The whole volume of Nature lies open to your
<PB N="27" REF="025067_0024_0FCE49E55DFDDF28">
eye, and furni&s;hes an infinite variety of entertain|ment. If I was &s;ure that Nature had given you &s;uch &s;trong principles of ta&s;te and &s;entiment as would remain with you, and influence your fu|ture conduct, with the utmo&s;t plea&s;ure would I endeavour to direct your reading in &s;uch a way as might from that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;te to the utmo&s;t perfection of truth and elegance. "But when I reflect how ea&s;y it is to warm a girl's imagination, and how difficult deeply and permanently to affect her heart; how readily &s;he enters into every refine|ment of &s;entiment, and how ea&s;ily &s;he can &s;acri|fice them to vanity or convenience;" I think I may very probably do you an injury by arti|ficially creating a ta&s;te, which, if Nature never gave it you, would only &s;erve to embarra&s;s your future conduct. I do not want to <HI>make</HI> you any thing: I want to know what Nature has made you, and to perfect you on her plan. I do not wi&s;h you to have &s;entiments that might perplex you; I wi&s;h you to have &s;entiments that may uniformly and &s;teadily guide you, and &s;uch as your hearts &s;o thoroughly approve, that you would not forego them for any con&s;ideration this world could offer.</P>
<P>Dre&s;s is an important article in female life. The love of dre&s;s is natural to you, and therefore it is proper and rea&s;onable. Good &s;en&s;e will re|gulate your expence in it, and good ta&s;te will di|rect you to dre&s;s in &s;uch a way as to conceal any blemi&s;hes, and &s;et off your beauties, if you have any, to the greate&s;t advantage. But much delica|cy and judgement are required in the application of this rule. A fine woman &s;hews her charms to mo&s;t advantage, when &s;he &s;eems mo&s;t to con|ceal them. The fine&s;t bo&s;om in nature is not &s;o
<PB N="28" REF="025067_0025_0FCE4A1F510AF210">
fine as what imagination forms. The mo&s;t perfect elegance of dre&s;s appears always the mo&s;t ea&s;y, and the lea&s;t &s;tudied.</P>
<P>Do not confine your attention to dre&s;s to your public appearances. Accu&s;tom your&s;elves to an habitual neatne&s;s, &s;o that in the mo&s;t carele&s;s un|dre&s;s, in your mo&s;t unguarded hours, you may have no rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of your appearance. You will not ea&s;ily believe how much we con&s;ider your dre&s;s as expre&s;&s;ive of your characters. Va|nity, levity, &s;lovenline&s;s, folly, appear through it. An elegant &s;implicity is an equal proof of ta&s;te and delicacy.</P>
<P>In dancing, the principal points you are to attend to are ea&s;e and grace: I would have you to dance with &s;pirit; but never allow your&s;elves to be &s;o far tran&s;ported with mirth, as to forget the delicacy of your &s;ex. Many a girl dancing in the gaiety and innocence of her heart, is thought to di&s;cover a &s;pi|rit &s;he little dreams of.</P>
<P>I know no entertainment that gives &s;uch plea|&s;ure to any per&s;on of &s;entiment or humour, as the theatre. But I am &s;orry to &s;ay there are few Engli&s;h comedies a lady can &s;ee, without a &s;hock to delicacy. You will not readily &s;u&s;pect the comments gentlemen make on your behaviour on &s;uch occa&s;ions. Men are often be&s;t acquainted with the mo&s;t worthle&s;s of your &s;ex, and from them too readily form their judgement of the re&s;t. A virtuous girl often hears very indelicate things with a countenance no wi&s;e embarra&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e in truth &s;he does not under&s;tand them. Yet this is, mo&s;t ungenerou&s;ly, a&s;cribed to that command of features, and that ready pre&s;ence of mind, which you are thought to po&s;&s;e&s;s in a degree
<PB N="29" REF="025067_0026_0FCE49E645133D78">
far beyond us; or, by &s;till more malignant ob&s;ervers, it is a&s;cribed to hardened effrontery.</P>
<P>Sometimes a girl laughs with all the &s;implicity of un&s;u&s;pecting innocence, for no other rea&s;on but being infected with other people's laughinging: &s;he is then believed to know more than &s;he &s;hould do. If &s;he does happen to under&s;tand an impro|per thing, &s;he &s;uffers a very complicated di&s;tre&s;s. &s;he feels her mode&s;ty hurt in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible man|ner, and at the &s;ame time is a&s;hamed of appearing con&s;cious of the injury. The only way to avoid the&s;e inconveniencies, is never to go to a play that is par|ticularly offen&s;ive to delicacy. Tragedy &s;ubjects you to no &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;Its &s;orrows will &s;often and enable your hearts.</P>
<P>I need &s;ay little about gaming, the ladies in this country being as yet almo&s;t &s;trangers to it. It is a ruinous and incurable vice; and as it leads to all the &s;elfi&s;h and turbulent pa&s;&s;ions, is peculiarly odious in your &s;ex. I have no objection to your playing a little at any kind of game, as a variety in your a|mu&s;ements, provided that what you can po&s;&s;ibly lo&s;e is &s;uch a trifle as can neither intere&s;t you, nor hurt you.</P>
<P>In this, as well as in all important points of con|duct, &s;hew a determined re&s;olution and &s;teadine&s;s. This is not in the lea&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent with that &s;oftne&s;s and gentlene&s;s &s;o amiable in your &s;ex. On the con|trary, it gives that &s;pirit to a mild and &s;weet di&s;posi|tion, without which it is apt to degenerate into in&s;ipidity. It makes you re&s;pectable in your own eyes, and dignifies you in ours.</P>

<HEAD>FRIENDSHIP, LOVE, MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE luxury and di&s;&s;ipation that prevails in genteel life, as it corrupts the heart in many re&s;pects, &s;o it renders it incapable of warm, &s;in|cere, and &s;teady friend&s;hip. A happy choice of friends will be of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to you, as they may a&s;&s;i&s;t you by their advice and good offices. But the immediate gratification which friend&s;hip affords to a warm, open, and ingenuous heart, is of it&s;elf a &s;ufficient motive to court it.</P>
<P>In the choice of your friends, have your prin|cipal regard to goodne&s;s of heart and fidelity. If they al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s ta&s;te and genius, that will &s;till make them more agreeable and u&s;eful com|panions. You have particular rea&s;on to place confidence in tho&s;e who have &s;hewn affection for you in your early days, when you were incapable of making them any return. This is an obligation for which you cannot be too grateful. When you read this, you will naturally think of your mother's friend, to whom you owe &s;o much.</P>
<P>If you have the good fortune to meet with any who de&s;erve the name of friends, unbo&s;om your|&s;elf to them with the mo&s;t un&s;u&s;picious confi|dence. It is one of the world's maxims, never to tru&s;t any per&s;on with a &s;ecret, the di&s;covery of which could give you any pain; but it is the maxim of a little mind and a cold heart, unle&s;s where it is the effect of frequent di&s;appointments and bad u&s;age. An open temper, it re&s;trained but by tolerable prudence, will make you, on the whole, much happier than re&s;erved &s;u&s;picious
<PB N="31" REF="025067_0028_0FCE49E7A3710368">
one, although you may &s;ometimes &s;uffer by it. Coldne&s;s and di&s;tru&s;t are but the too certain con|&s;equences of age and experience; but they are un|plea&s;ant feelings, and need not be anticipated before their time.</P>
<P>But however open you may be in talking of your affairs, never di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ecrets of one friend to another. The&s;e are &s;ecret depo&s;its, which do not belong to you, nor have you any right to make u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>There is another ca&s;e, in which I &s;u&s;pect it is proper to be &s;ecret, not &s;o much from motives of prudence, as delicacy; I mean in love matters. Though a woman has no rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of an attachment to a man of merit, yet Nature, who&s;e authority is &s;uperior to philo&s;ophy, has annexed a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame to it. It is even long be|fore a woman of delicacy dares avow to her own heart that &s;he loves; and when all the &s;ubterfuges of ingenuity to conceal it from her&s;elf fail, &s;he feels a violence done both to her pride and to her mode|&s;ty. This, I &s;hould imagine, mu&s;t always be the ca&s;e where &s;he is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of a return to her attach|ment.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a &s;ituation, to lay the heart open to any per&s;on whatever, does not appear to me con|&s;i&s;tent with the perfection of female delicacy. But perhaps I am in the wrong. At the &s;ame time I mu&s;t tell you, that, in point of prudence, it concerns you to attend well to the con&s;equences of &s;uch a di&s;covery. The&s;e &s;ecrets, however important in your own e&s;timation, may appear very trifling to your friend, who po&s;&s;ibly will not enter into your feelings, but may rather con&s;ider <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as a &s;ubject of plea&s;antry. For this rea&s;on love &s;ecrets are of all others the wor&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

There are certain unguarded moments, in which &s;uch a woman, though the be&s;t and worthie&s;t of her &s;ex, may let hints e&s;cape, which at other times, or to any other per&s;on than her hu&s;band, &s;he would be incapable of; nor will a hu&s;band in this ca&s;e feel him&s;elf under the &s;ame obligation of &s;ecrecy and honour, as if you had put your confidence origi|nally in him&s;elf, e&s;pecially on a &s;ubject which the world is apt to treat &s;o lightly.</P>
<P>If all other circum&s;tances are equal, there are obvious advantages in your making friends of one another. The ties of blood, and your being &s;o much united in one common intere&s;t, from an additional bond of union to your friend&s;hip. If your brothers &s;hould have the good fortune to have hearts &s;u&s;ceptible of friend&s;hip, to po&s;&s;e&s;s truth, honour, &s;en&s;e and delicacy of &s;entiment, they are the fitte&s;t and mo&s;t unexceptionable con|fidants.

<P>Beware of making confidants of your &s;ervants. Dignity not properly under&s;tood very readily de|generates into pride, which enters into no friend|&s;hip, becau&s;e it cannot bear an equal, and is &s;o fond of flattery as to gra&s;p at it even from &s;er|vants and dependants. The mo&s;t intimate con|fidants, therefore, of proud people, are valets-de-chamber and waiting-women. Shew the utmo&s;t

<P>Never allow any per&s;on, under the pretended &s;anction of friend&s;hip, to be &s;o familiar as to lo&s;e a proper re&s;pect to you. Never allow them to teaze you on any &s;ubject that is di&s;agreeable, or where you have once taken your re&s;olution. Ma|ny will tell you, that this re&s;erve is incon&s;i&s;tent with the freedom which friend&s;hip allows; but a certain re&s;pect is as nece&s;&s;ary in friend&s;hip as in love. Without it you may be liked as a child, but you will never be beloved as an equal.</P>
<P>The temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the heart in your &s;ex make you enter more readily and warmly into friend&s;hips than men. Your natural propen&s;ity to it is &s;o &s;trong, that you often run into intima|cies which you &s;oon have &s;ufficient cau&s;e to re|pent of; and this makes your friend&s;hips &s;o very fluctuating.</P>
<P>Another great ob&s;tacle to the &s;incerity as well as &s;teadine&s;s of your friend&s;hips, is the great cla&s;hing of your intere&s;ts in the pur&s;uits of love, ambition, or vanity. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, it would appear it fir&s;t view more eligible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you to con|tract your friend&s;hips with the men. Among other obvious advantages of an ea&s;y intercour&s;e between the two &s;exes it occa&s;ions an emulation and exertion in each to excel and be agreeable: hence their re&s;pective excellencies are mutually communicated and blended.

<P>But apply the&s;e ob&s;ervations with great caution. Thou&s;ands of women of the be&s;t hearts and fine&s;t parts have been ruined by men who approach them under the &s;pecious name of friend&s;hip.

<P>The effects of love among men are diver&s;ified by their different tempers. An artful man may counterfeit every one of them &s;o ea&s;ily as to im|po&s;e on a young girl of an open, generous, and feeling heart, if &s;he is not extremely on her guard. The fine&s;t parts in &s;uch a girl may not always prove &s;ufficient for her &s;ecurity. The dark and crooked paths of cunning are un&s;earchable and inconceivable to an honourable and elevated mind.</P>
<P>The following, I apprehend, are the mo&s;t ge|nuine effects of an honourable pa&s;&s;ion among the men, and the mo&s;t difficult to counterfeit. A man of delicacy often betrays his pa&s;&s;ion by his too great anxiety to conceal it, e&s;pecially if he has little hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. True love, in all its &s;tages, &s;eeks concealment, and never expects &s;ucce&s;s. It renders a man not only re&s;pectful, but timid to the highe&s;t degree in his behaviour to the woman he loves. To conceal the awe he &s;tands in of her, he may &s;ometimes affect plea&s;antry, but it &s;its awkwardly on him, and he quickly relap&s;es in|to &s;eriousne&s;s, if not into dulne&s;s. He magnifies all her real perfections in his imagination, and is either blind to her failings, or converts them into beau|ties. Like a per&s;on con&s;cious of guilt, he is jea|lous that every eye ob&s;erves his; and to avoid this, he &s;huns all the little ob&s;ervances of common gal|lantry.</P>
<P>His heart and his character will be improved in every re&s;pect by his attachment. His manners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> become more gentle, and his conver&s;ation more agreeable: but diffidence and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> always make him appear to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="38" REF="025067_0035_0FCE4A2B217BC700">
in the company of his mi&s;tre&s;s. If the fa&s;ci|nation continue long, it will totally depre&s;s his &s;pirit, and extingui&s;h every active, vigorous, and manly principle of his mind. You will find this &s;ubject beautifully and pathetically painted in Thom&s;on's Spring.</P>
<P>When you ob&s;erve in a gentleman's behaviour the&s;e marks which I have de&s;cribed above, reflect &s;eriou&s;ly what you are to do. If his attachment is agreeable to you, I leave you to do as nature, good &s;en&s;e, and delicacy &s;hall direct you. If you love him, let me advi&s;e you never to di&s;cover to him the full extent of your love, no, not although you marry him. That &s;ufficiently &s;hews your preference, which is all he is intitled to know. If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e has delicacy, he will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for no &s;tronger proof of your affection for your &s;ake; if he has &s;en&s;e, he will no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a&s;k it for his own. This is an unplea&s;ant truth, but it is my duty to let you know it. Vio|lent love cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, at lea&s;t cannot be expre&s;&s;ed, for any time together on both &s;ides; otherwi&s;e the certain con&s;equence, however concealed, is &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t. Nature in this ca&s;e has laid the re&s;erve on you.</P>
<P>If you &s;ee evident proofs of a gentleman's at|tachment, and are determined to &s;hut your heart again&s;t him, as you ever hope to be u&s;ed with genero&s;ity by the per&s;on who &s;hall engage your own heart, treat him honourably and humanely. Do not let him linger in a mi&s;erable &s;u&s;pen&s;e, but be anxious to let him know your &s;entiments with re|gard to him.</P>
<P>However people's hearts may deceive them, there is &s;carcely a per&s;on that can love for any time without at lea&s;t &s;ome di&s;tant hope of &s;ucce&s;s. If you really wi&s;h to undeceive a lover, you may do
<PB N="39" REF="025067_0036_0FCE49F2E2ED48C0">
it in a variety of ways. There is a certain &s;pecies of ea&s;y familiarity in your behaviour which may &s;atisfy him, if he has any di&s;cernment left, that he has nothing to hope for. But perhaps your particular temper may not admit of this: you may ea&s;ily &s;hew that you want to avoid his com|pany; but if he is a man who&s;e friend&s;hip you wi&s;h to pre&s;erve, you may not chu&s;e this method, becau&s;e then you lo&s;e him in every capacity. You may get a common friend to explain matters to him, or fall on many other divice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> you are &s;eriou&s;ly anxi|ous to put him out of &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>But if you are re&s;olved again&s;t every &s;uch me|thod, at lea&s;t do not &s;hun opportunities of letting him explain him&s;elf. If you do this, you act barbarou&s;ly and unju&s;tly. If he brings you to an explanation, give him a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">e, but re&s;olute and deci&s;ive an&s;wer. In whatever, way you convey your &s;entiments to him, if he is a man of &s;pirit and delicacy, he will give you no further trou|ble, nor apply to your friends for their interce&s;|&s;ion. This la&s;t is a method of court&s;hip which every man of &s;pirit will di&s;dain. He will never whine nor &s;ue for your pity: That would morti|fy him almo&s;t as much as your &s;corn. In &s;hort, you may po&s;&s;ibly break &s;uch a heart, but you can never bend it. Great pride always accompanies delicacy, however concealed under the appear|ance of the utmo&s;t gentlene&s;s and mode&s;ty, and is the pa&s;&s;ion of all others the mo&s;t difficult to conquer.</P>
<P>There is a ca&s;e where a woman may coquette ju&s;tifiably to the utmo&s;t verge which her con|&s;cience will allow. It is where a gentleman pur|po&s;ely declines to make his addre&s;&s;es, till &s;uch time as he thinks him&s;elf perfectly &s;ure of her
<PB N="40" REF="025067_0037_0FCE4A2C9EDF6588">
con&s;ent. This at bottom is intended to force a woman to give up the undoubted privilege of her &s;ex, the privilege of refu&s;ing; it is intended to force her to explain her&s;elf, in effect, before the gentleman deigns to do it, and by this means to oblige her to violate the mode&s;ty and delicacy of her &s;ex, and to invert the cleare&s;t order of nature. All this &s;acrifice is propo&s;ed to be made merely to gratify a mo&s;t de&s;picable vanity in a man who would degrade the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> woman whom he wi&s;hes to make his wife.</P>
<P>It is of great importance to di&s;tingui&s;h whether a gentleman, who has the appearance of being your lover, delays to &s;peak explicitly, from the motive I have mentioned, or from a diffidence in&s;eparable from true attachment. In the one ca&s;e, you can &s;carcely u&s;e him too ill; in the other, you ought to u&s;e him with great kindne&s;s: and the greate&s;t kindne&s;s you can &s;hew him, if you are determined not to li&s;ten to his addre&s;&s;es, is to let him know it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I know the many excu&s;es with which women endeavour to ju&s;tify them&s;elves to the world, and to their own con&s;ciences, when they act otherwi&s;e. Sometimes they plead ignorance, or at lea&s;t un|certainty, of the gentleman's real &s;entiments. That may &s;ometimes be the ca&s;e. Sometimes they plead the decorum of their &s;ex, which en|joins an equal behaviour to all men, and forbids them to con&s;ider any man as a lover till he has directly told them &s;o. Perhaps few women carry their ideas of female delicacy and decorum &s;o far as I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o. But I mu&s;t &s;ay, you are not intitled to plead the obligation of the&s;e virtues in oppo&s;ition to the &s;uperior ones of gratitude, ju&s;tice and hu|manity. The man is intitled to all there, who
<PB N="41" REF="025067_0038_0FCE49F4652C5B80">
prefers you to the re&s;t of your &s;ex, and perhaps who&s;e greate&s;t weakne&s;s is this very preference. The truth of the matter is, vanity, and the love of admiration, is &s;o prevailing a pa&s;&s;ion among you, that you may be con&s;idered to make a very great &s;acrifice whenever you give up a lover, till every art of coquetry fails to keep him, or till he forces you to an explanation. You can be fond of the love, when you are indifferent to, or even when you de&s;pi&s;e the lover.</P>
<P>But the deepe&s;t and mo&s;t artful coquetry is em|ployed by women of &s;uperior ta&s;te and &s;en&s;e, to engage and fix the heart of a man whom the world and whom they them&s;elves e&s;teem, al|though they are firmly determined never to mar|ry him. But his conver&s;ation amu&s;es them, and his attachment is the highe&s;t gratification to their vanity: nay, they can &s;ometimes be gratified with the utter ruin of his fortune, &s;ame and hap|pine&s;s. God forbid I &s;hould ever think &s;o of all your &s;ex! I know many of them have princi|ples, have genero&s;ity and dignity of &s;oul that ele|vate them above the worthle&s;s vanity I have been &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>Such a woman, I am per&s;uaded, may always convert a lover, if &s;he cannot give him her affec|tions, into a warm and &s;teady friend, provided he is a man of &s;en&s;e, re&s;olution and candour. If &s;he explains her&s;elf with a generous openne&s;s and freedom, he mu&s;t feel the &s;troke as a man; but he will likewi&s;e bear it as a man: what he &s;uffers, he will &s;uffer in &s;ilence. Every &s;entiment of e&s;teem will remain; but love, though it re|quires very little food, and is ea&s;ily &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ited with too much, yet it requires &s;ome. He will view her in the light of a married woman; and
<PB N="42" REF="025067_0039_0FCE4A32D627B508">
though pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;ides, yet a man of a candid and generous heart always retains a tenderne&s;s for a woman he has once loved, and who has u&s;ed him well, beyond what he feels for any other of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>If he has not confided his own &s;ecret to any body, he has an undoubted title to a&s;k you not to divulge it. If a woman chu&s;es to tru&s;t any of her companions with her own unfortunate at|tachments, &s;he may, as it is her own affair alone; but if &s;he has any genero&s;ity or gratitude, &s;he will not betray a &s;ecret which does not belong to her.</P>
<P>Male coquetry is much more in excu&s;able than female, as well as more pernicious; but it is rare in this country. Very few men will give them&s;elves the trouble to gain or retain any wo|man's affections, unle&s;s they have views on them either of an honourable or di&s;honourable kind. Men employed in the pur&s;uits of bu&s;ine&s;s, am|bition or plea&s;ure, will not give them&s;elves the trouble to engage a woman's affections, merely from the vanity of conque&s;t, and of triumphing over the heart of an innocent and defencele&s;s girl. Be&s;ides, people never value much what is entirely in their power. A man of parts, &s;enti|ment and addre&s;s, if he lays a&s;ide all regard to truth and humanity, may e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gae the hearts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> women at the &s;ame time, and may likewi&s;e conduct his coquetry with &s;o much art, as to put it out of the power of any of them to &s;pecify <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion that could be &s;aid to be directly ex|pre&s;&s;ive of love.</P>
<P>This ambiguity of behaviour, this art of keep|ing one in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, is the great &s;ecret of coquetry in both &s;exes. It is the more cruel in as, be|cau&s;e

<P>I have in&s;i&s;ted the more particularly on this &s;ubject of court&s;hip, becau&s;e it may mo&s;t readily happen to you at that early period of life when you can have little experience or knowledge of the word; when your pa&s;&s;ions are warm, and your judgments not arrived at &s;uch full maturity as to be able to correct them. I wi&s;h you to po&s;&s;es &s;uch high principles of honour and genero&s;ity as will ren|der you incapable of deceiving, and at the &s;ame time to po&s;&s;e&s;s that acute di&s;cernment which may &s;ecure you again&s;t being deceived.</P>
<P>A woman, in this country, may ea&s;ily prevent the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of love; and every motive of prudence and delicacy &s;hould make her guard her heart again&s;t them, till &s;uch time as &s;he has re|ceived the mo&s;t convincing proofs of the attach|ment of a man of &s;uch merit, as will ju&s;tify a reciprocal regard. Your hearts indeed may be &s;hut inflexibly and permanently again&s;t all the merit a man can po&s;&s;es. That may be your mis|fortune, but cannot be your fault. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, you would be equally unju&s;t to your|&s;elf and your lover, if you gave him your hand when your heart revolted again&s;t him. But mi|&s;erable will be your fate, if you allow an attach|ment to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">al on you before you are &s;ure of a re|turn; or, what is infinitely wor&s;e, where there are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e qualities which alone can en&s;ure hap|pine&s;s in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;tate.</P>

But if it was true, the belief that it is &s;o, and the con&s;equent impa|tience to be married, is the mo&s;t effectual way to prevent it.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not think from this that I do not wi&s;h you to marry; on the contrary, I am of opinion, that you may attain a &s;uperior degree of happine&s;s in a married &s;tate, to what you can po&s;&s;ibly find in any other. I know the forlorn and unprotected &s;ituation of an old maid, the chagrin and peevi&s;hne&s;s which are apt to infect their tempers, and the great difficulty of making a tran&s;ition, with dignity and cheerfulne&s;s, from the period of youth, beauty, admiration and re&s;pect, into the calm, &s;ilent unnoticed retreat of declining years.</P>
<P>I &s;ee &s;ome unmarried women, of active vi|gorous minds, and great vivacity of &s;pirits, de|grading them&s;elves; &s;ometimes by entering into a di&s;&s;ipated cour&s;e of life, un&s;uitable to their years, and expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the ridicule of girls, who might have been their grand children; &s;ometimes by oppre&s;&s;ing their acquintances by impertinent intru&s;ions in their private affairs; and &s;ometimes by being the propagators of &s;can|dal and defamation. All this is owing to an exu|berant activity of &s;pirit, which, if it had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound em|ployment at home, would have rendered them re|&s;pectable and u&s;eful members of &s;ociety.</P>

<P>In &s;hort, I am of opinion, that a married &s;tate, if entered into from proper motives of e&s;teem and affection, will be the happie&s;t for your&s;elves, make you mo&s;t re&s;pectable in the eyes of the world, and the mo&s;t u&s;eful members of &s;ociety: but I con|fess I am not enough of a Patriot to wi&s;h you to marry for the good of the public;&mdash;I wi&s;h you to marry for no other rea&s;on but to make your&s;elves happier. When I am &s;o particular in my advices about your conduct, I own my heart beats with the fond hope of making you worthy the attachment of men who will de&s;erve you, and be &s;en&s;ible of your merit. But Heaven forbid you &s;hould ever relinqui&s;h the ea&s;e and independence of a &s;ingle life, to become the &s;laves of a fool or a ty|rant's caprice.</P>
<P>As the&s;e have always been my &s;entiments, I &s;hall do you but ju&s;tice, when I leave you in &s;uch independent circum&s;tances as may lay you under no temptation to do from nece&s;&s;ity what you would never do from choice.

<P>If I live till you arrive at that age when you &s;hall be capable to judge for your&s;elves, and do not &s;trangely alter my &s;entiments, I &s;hall act to|wards you in a very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> manner from what mo&s;t parents do.

<P>I hope I &s;hall always treat you with that affec|tion and ea&s;y confidence which may di&s;po&s;e you to look on me as your friend; in that capacity alone I &s;hall think my&s;elf intitled to give you my opinion; in the doing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. I &s;hould think my&s;elf highly criminal, if I did not to the utmo&s;t of my power endeavour to dive&s;t my&s;elf of all per&s;onal vanity, and all prejudices in favour of my particular ta&s;te.

you do not allow gentlemen to become acquainted with you, you can never expect to marry with attachment on either &s;ide&mdash;Love is very &s;eldom produced at fir&s;t &s;ight, at lea&s;t it mu&s;t have, in that ca&s;e, a very unju&s;tifiable foundation. True love is founded on e&s;teem, in a corre&s;pondence of ta&s;tes and &s;entiments, and &s;teals on the heart im|perceptibly.</P>
<P>There is one advice I &s;hall leave you, to which I beg your particular attention:&mdash;Before your affections come to be in the lea&s;t engaged to any man, examine your tempers, your ta&s;tes, and your hearts, very &s;everely, and fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">e in your own minds, what are the requi&s;ites to your happine&s;s in a married &s;tate; and, as it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;i|ble that you &s;hould get every thing you wi&s;h, come to a &s;teady determination what you are to con&s;ider as e&s;&s;ential, and what may be &s;acrificed.</P>
<P>If you have hearts di&s;po&s;ed by nature for love and friend&s;hip, and po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e feelings which enable you to enter into all the refinements and delicacies of the&s;e attachments, con&s;ider well, for Heaven's &s;ake, and as you value your future happine&s;s, before you give them any indulgence.

<P><PB N="48" REF="025067_0045_0FCE4A375824B5B8">
But if you find on a &s;trict &s;elf-examination that marriage is ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to your hap|pine&s;s, keep the &s;ecret inviolable in your own bo&s;oms, for the rea&s;ons I formerly mentioned; but &s;hun as you would do the mo&s;t fatal poi&s;on, all that &s;pecies of reading and conver&s;ation which warms the imagination, which engages and &s;of|tens the heart, and rai&s;es the ta&s;te above the level of common life; if you do otherwi&s;e, confider the terrible conflict of pa&s;&s;ions this may afterwards rai&s;e in your brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>If this refinement once takes deep root in your minds, and you do not obey its dictates, but marry from vulgar and mercenary views, you may never be able to eradicate it entirely, and then it will embitter all your married days. In|&s;tead of meeting with &s;en&s;e, delicacy, tenderne&s;s, a lover, a friend, an equal companion, In a hu&s;|band, you may be tired with in&s;ipidity and dul|ne&s;s; &s;hocked with indelicacy, or mortified by indifference. You will find none to compa&s;&s;ionate, or even under&s;tand your &s;ufferings; for your hu&s;bands may not u&s;e you cruelly, and may give you as much money for your clothes, per&s;onal expence, and dome&s;tic nece&s;&s;aries, as is &s;uitable to their fortunes. The world would therefore look on you as unrea&s;onable women, and that did not de&s;erve to be happy, if you were not &s;o. To avoid the&s;e complicated evils, if you are de|termined at all events to marry, I would advi&s;e you to make all your reading and amu&s;ements of &s;uch a kind, as do not affect the heart nor the imagination, except in the way of wit or humour.</P>
<P>I have no view by the&s;e advices to lead your ta&s;tes; I only want to per&s;uade you of the nece&s;|&s;ity of knowing your own minds, which, though
<PB N="49" REF="025067_0046_0FCE49FE4C0B86D0">
&s;eemingly very ea&s;y, is what your &s;ex &s;eldom at|tain on many important occa&s;ions in life, but particularly on this of which I am &s;peaking. There is not a quality I more anxiou&s;ly wi&s;h you to po&s;&s;e&s;s, than that collective deci&s;ive &s;pi|rit, which re&s;ts on it&s;elf which enables you to &s;ee where your true happine&s;s lies, and to pur|&s;ue it with the mo&s;t determined re&s;olution. In matters of bu&s;ine&s;s, follow the advice of tho&s;e who know them better than your&s;elves, and in who&s;e integrity you can confide; but in matters of ta&s;te, that depend on your own feelings, con|&s;ult no one friend whatever, but con&s;ult your own hearts.</P>
<P>If a gentleman makes his addre&s;&s;es to you, or gives you rea&s;on to believe he will do &s;o, before you allow your affections to be engaged, endea|vour, in the mo&s;t prudent and &s;ecret manner, to procure from your friends every nece&s;&s;ary piece of information concerning him; &s;uch as his cha|racter for &s;en&s;e, his morals, his temper, fortune, and family; whether it is di&s;tingui&s;hed for parts and worth, or for folly, knavery, and loath&s;ome hereditary di&s;ea&s;es. When your friends inform you of the&s;e&punc; they have fulfilled their duty.

<P>From what I have &s;aid, you will ea&s;ily &s;ee that I could never pretend to advi&s;e whom you &s;hould marry; but I can with great confidence advi&s;e whom you &s;hould not marry.</P>
<P>Avoid a companion that may entail any heredi|tary di&s;ea&s;e on your po&s;terity, particularly (that mo&s;t dreadful of all human calamities) madne&s;s. It is the height of imprudence to run into &s;uch a danger, and, in my opinion, highly criminal.</P>
<P>Do not marry a fool; he is the mo&s;t intractable of all animals; he is led by his pa&s;&s;ions and ca|prices, and is incapable of hearing the voice of rea&s;on. It may probably too hurt your vanity to have hu&s;bands for whom you have rea&s;on to blu&s;h and tremble every time they open their lips in company. But the wor&s;t circum&s;tance that attends a fool<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> his con&s;tant jealou&s;y of his wife being thought to govern him.

<P>A rake is always a &s;u&s;picious hu&s;band, becau&s;e, he has only known the mo&s;t worthle&s;s of your &s;ex. He like wi&s;e entails the wor&s;t di&s;ea&s;es on his wife and children, if he has the misfortune to have any.</P>
<P>If you have a &s;en&s;e of religion your&s;elves, do not think of hu&s;bands who have none.

<P>As I look on your choice of a hu&s;band to be of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to your happine&s;s, I hope you will make it with the utmo&s;t circum&s;pecti|on. Do not give way to a &s;udden &s;ally of pa&s;&s;ion, and dignify it with the name of love.&mdash;Genuine love is not founded in caprice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> it is founded in nature, on honourable views, on virtue, on &s;imilarity of ta&s;tes and &s;ympathy of &s;ouls.</P>
<P>If you love the&s;e &s;entiments, you will never marry any one, when you are not in that &s;ituation, in point of fortune, which is nece&s;&s;ary to the hap|pine&s;s of either of you. What that competency may be, can only be determined by your own ta&s;tes. It would be ungenerous in you to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> advantage of a lover's attachment, to plunge him into di&s;tre&s;s; and if he has any honour, no per&s;onal gratification will ever tempt him to enter into any connection which will render you unhappy. If you have as much between you as to &s;atisfy all your demands, it is &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with endeavouring to remove a difficulty which mu&s;t naturally occur to any woman of reflection on the &s;ubject of marriage. What is to become of all tho&s;e refinements of delicacy, that dignity of manners, which check|ed all familiarities, and &s;u&s;pended de&s;ire in re|spectful and awful admiration? In an&s;wer to this, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that if motives of intere&s;t or vanity have had any &s;hare in your re&s;olutions

to marry, none of the&s;e chimerical notions will give you any pain; nay, they will very quickly appear as ridiculous in your own eyes, as they probably always did in the eyes of your hu&s;bands. They have been &s;entiments which have floated in your imaginations, but have never reached your hearts. But if the&s;e &s;entiments have been truly genuine, and if you have had the &s;ingular happy fate to attach tho&s;e who under&s;tand them, you have no rea&s;on to be afraid.</P>
<P>Marriage, indeed, will at once di&s;pel the en|chantment rai&s;ed by external beauty; but the virtues and graces that fir&s;t warmed the heart, that re&s;erve and delicacy which always left the lover &s;omething further to wi&s;h, and often made him doubtful of your &s;en&s;ibility or attachment, may and ought ever to remain. The tumult of pa&s;&s;ion will nece&s;&s;arily &s;ub&s;ide; but it will be &s;ucceeded by an endearment, that effects the heart in a more equal, more &s;en&s;ible, and tender manner. But I mu&s;t check my&s;elf, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not in|dulge in de&s;criptions that may mi&s;lead you, and that too &s;en&s;ibly awake the remembrance of my happier days, which, perhaps, it were better for me to forget for ever.</P>
<P>I have thus given you my opinion on &s;ome of the mo&s;t important articles of your future life, chiefly calculated for that period when you are ju&s;t entering the world. I have endeavoured to avoid &s;ome peculiarities of opinion, which, from their con|tradiction to the general practice of the world, I might rea&s;onably have &s;u&s;pected were not to well founded.

<P>WAS there any probability that a letter from me would be permitted to reach <HI>your hand alone,</HI> I &s;hould not have cho&s;en this lea&s;t eligible method of writing to you.

<P>A long train of events, of a mo&s;t extraordinary nature con&s;pired to remove you, very early from the tender care of an affectionate mother. You were then too young to be able to form any right judgement of her conduct; and &s;ince that time it is very probable that it has been repre&s;ented to you in the mo&s;t unfavourable light. The gene|ral prejudice again&s;t me I never gave my&s;elf the u&s;ele&s;s trouble of any endeavour to remove.

<P>It is acknowledged that our petitions cannot in any degree alter the intention of a Being, who is in him&s;elf invariable, and without a po&s;&s;ibility of change; all that can be expected from them is, that, by bettering our&s;elves, they will render us more proper objects of His favourable regard; and this mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the re&s;ult of a &s;erious, regular, and con&s;tant di&s;charge of this branch of our duty; for it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to offer up our &s;incere and fervent devotions to Heaven every morning and evening, without leaving on our minds &s;uch u&s;eful impre&s;&s;ions as will natu|rally di&s;po&s;e us to a ready and cheerful obedience, and will in&s;pire a filial fear of offending, the be&s;t &s;ecurity virtue can have.

Regard neither the actions nor the dre&s;s of others: let not your eyes rove in &s;earch of acquaintance, but in the time of divine &s;ervice avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, all complimental civilities, of which there are too great an intercour&s;e, in mo&s;t of our churches.

Nothing has more contributed to the neglect of this duty, than the numerous well-meaning books that have been written to enjoin a month's or a week's preparation, as previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to the due performance of it; by the&s;e means fil|ling the minds of many with needle&s;s terror, put|ting it even out of the power of &s;ome to receive it at all, and inducing great numbers to re&s;t &s;a|tisfied with doing it only once or twice in a year, on &s;ome high fe&s;tival; whereas it was certainly the con&s;tant cu&s;tom of the apo&s;tles and primitive chri&s;tians on every Sunday; and it ought to be received by us as often as it is admini&s;tered in the church we frequent, which in mo&s;t places is but once in a month.

Youth is the &s;ea&s;on for diver&s;ions, but it is al&s;o the &s;ea&s;on for acquiring knowledge, for fixing u&s;eful habits, and for laying in a &s;tock of &s;uch well-cho&s;en materials, as may grow into a &s;erene happine&s;s, which will encrea&s;e with every added year of life, and will bloom in the fulle&s;t perfection in the decline of it.

It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that &s;ome reading ladies have given but too much cau&s;e for this objection; and could it be proved to hold good throughout the &s;ex, it would certainly be right to confine their im|provements within the narrow limits of the nur|&s;ery, of the kitchen, and the confectionary: but, I believe, it will, upon examination, be found, that &s;uch ill con&s;equences proceed chiefly from too great an imbecility of mind to be capable of much enlargement, or from a mere affectation of knowledge, void of all reality. Vanity is never the re&s;ult of under&s;tanding.

directly influence your conduct in life&mdash;<HI>Our rule of faith</HI> &s;hould be taken from the &s;cripture alone, which we mu&s;t under&s;tand for our&s;elves; therefore the controverted opinions of others &s;erve in general rather to puzzle than to improve the mind.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Novels and Romances,</HI> very few are worth the trouble of reading: &s;ome of them per|haps do contain a few good morals, but they are not worth the finding where &s;o much rubbi&s;h is intermixed. Their moral parts indeed are like &s;mall diamonds among&s;t mountains of dirt and tra&s;h, which, after you have found them, are too incon|&s;iderable to an&s;wer the pains of coming at: yet, ridiculous as the&s;e fictirious tales generally are, they are &s;o artfully managed as to excite an idle curio&s;ity to &s;ee the conclu&s;ion, by which means the reader is drawn on, through a tire&s;ome length of fooli&s;h adventures, from which neither know|ledge, plea&s;ure, or profit, &s;eldom can accrue, to the common cata&s;trophe of a wedding. The mo&s;t I have met with of the&s;e writings, to &s;ay no wor&s;e, it is little better than the lo&s;s of time to peru&s;e. But &s;ome of them have more pernicious con&s;equences. By drawing characters that never exi&s;t in life, by repre&s;enting per&s;ons and things in a fal&s;e and extravagant light, and by a &s;eries of improbable cau&s;es bringing on impo&s;&s;ible events, they are apt to give a romantic turn to the mind, which is often productive of great errors in judg|ment, and of fatal mi&s;takes in conduct. Of this I have &s;een frequent in&s;tances, and therefore advi&s;e you &s;carce ever to meddle with any of them.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tice however to a late ingenious author, this Letter mu&s;t not be reprinted, without my ac|knowledging that, &s;ince the la&s;t edition was pub|li&s;hed, I have accidentally met with one exception

to my general rule, namely, <HI>The Vicar of Wake-field.</HI> That novel is equally entertaining and in&s;tructive, without being liable to any of the objections that occa&s;ioned the above re&s;triction.

<PB N="87" REF="025067_0083_0FCE4A97E5E58DA8">
an argument of great folly to engage in any thing without doing it well; but this is a diver&s;ion which I hope you will have no fondne&s;s for, as it is in it&s;elf, to &s;ay no wor&s;e, a very in&s;ignificant amu&s;e|ment.</P>
<P>With per&s;ons for whom you can have no e&s;teem, good-breeding may oblige you to keep up an in|tercour&s;e of ceremonious vi&s;its, but politene&s;s enjoins not the length or frequency of them. Here inclination may be followed without a breach of civility: there is no tax upon intimacy but from choice; and that choice &s;hould ever be founded on merit, the certainty whereof you cannot be too careful in previou&s;ly examining. Great caution is nece&s;&s;ary not to be deceived by &s;pecious appearances. A plau&s;ible behaviour of|ten, upon a &s;uperficial knowledge, creates, a pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of particulars, who, upon a nearer view, may be found to have no claim to e&s;teem. The forming a precipitate judgment &s;ometimes leads into an unwary intimacy, which it may prove ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eak off; and yet that breach may be attended with innu|merable inconveniencies; nay, perhaps, with very material and la&s;ting ill con&s;equences: prudence, therefore, here enjoins the greate&s;t circum&s;pection.</P>
<P>Few people are capable of friend&s;hip, and &s;till fewer have all the qualifications one would chu&s;e in a friend. The fundamental point is a virtuous di&s;po&s;ition; but to that &s;hould be added a good under&s;tanding, a &s;olid judgement, &s;weetne&s;s of temper, &s;teadine&s;s of mind, freedom of behavi|our, and &s;incerity of heart. Seldom as the&s;e are to be found united, never makes a bo&s;om friend of any one greatly deficient in either. Be &s;low in contracting friend&s;hip, and invariably con&s;tant in
<PB N="88" REF="025067_0084_0FCE4A644CD8E508">
maintaining it. Expect not many friends, but think your&s;elf happy, if, through life, you meet with one or two who de&s;erve that name, and have all the requi&s;ites for the valuable relation. This may ju&s;tly be deemed the highe&s;t ble&s;&s;ing of mor|tality. Uninterrupted health has the general voice; but, in my opinion, &s;uch an intercour&s;e of friend&s;hip, as much de&s;erves the preference, as the mental plea&s;ures, both in nature and degree, exceed the corporeal. The weakne&s;&s;es, the pains of the body may be inexpre&s;&s;ibly alleviated by the conver&s;ation of a per&s;on, by affection endear|ed, by rea&s;on approved; who&s;e tender &s;ympathy partakes your afflictions, and &s;hares your enjoy|ments; who is &s;teady in the correction, but mild in the reproof of your faults; like a guardian angel, ever watchful to warn you of unfore&s;een danger, and, by timely admonitions, to prevent the mi&s;takes incident to human frailty and to &s;elf-partiality: this is the true office of friend&s;hip, With &s;uch a friend, no &s;tate of life can be ab&s;o|lutely unhappy; but, de&s;titute of &s;ome &s;uch con|nection, Heaven has &s;o formed our natures for this intimate &s;ociety, that amid&s;t the affluence of fortune, and in the flow of uninterrupted health, there will be an aching void in the &s;olitary brea&s;t, which can never otherwi&s;e know a plenitude of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Should the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er of all events be|&s;tow on you this &s;uperlative gift, to &s;uch a friend let your heart be ever unre&s;ervedly open. Con|ceal no &s;ecret thought, di&s;gui&s;e no latent weak|ne&s;s, but bare your bo&s;om to the faithful probe of hone&s;t friend&s;hip, and &s;hrink not if it &s;marts beneath the touch; nor with tenacious pride di&s;|like the per&s;on who freely dares to condemn &s;ome

favourite foible; but, ever open to conviction, hear with attention, and receive with gratitude, the kind reproof that flows from tenderne&s;s. When &s;en&s;ible of a fault, be ingenuous in the confe&s;&s;ion&mdash;be &s;incere and &s;teady in the correction of it.</P>
<P>Happy is her lot, who in a Hu&s;band find this invaluable friend! Yet &s;o great is the ha|zard, &s;o di&s;proportioned the chances, that I could almo&s;t wi&s;h the dangerous die was never to be thrown for any of you: but as probably it may, let me conjure ye all, my dear girls, if ever any of you take this mo&s;t important &s;tep in life, to proceed with the utmo&s;t care and with deliberate circum&s;pection. Fortune and Family it is the &s;ole province of your father to direct in: he cer|tainly has always an undoubted right to a nega|tive voice, though not to a compul&s;ive one. As a child is very ju&s;tifiable in the refu&s;al of her hand, even to the ab&s;olute command of a father, where her heart cannot go with it; &s;o is &s;he ex|tremely culpable in giving it cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> to his ap|probation. Here I mu&s;t take &s;hame to my&s;elf; and for this unpardonable fault, I do ju&s;tly acknowledge that the &s;ub&s;equent ill con&s;equences <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a mo&s;t un|happy marriage were the proper puni&s;hment. This, and every other error in my own conduct, I do, and &s;hall, with the utmo&s;t candour, lay open to you; &s;incerely praying that you may reap the benefit of my experience, and that you may avoid tho&s;e rocks, which, either by carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, or &s;ometimes, alas, by too much caution, I have &s;plit again&s;t!

this, you will be continually &s;hocked by inde|cency, and pained by impiety. So numerous have been the unhappy victims to the ridiculous opinion, "<HI>A reformed libertine makes the be&s;t hu&s;band,</HI>" that, did not experience daily evince the contrary, one would believe it impo&s;&s;ible for a girl who has a tolerable degree of common under&s;tanding to be made the dupe of &s;o errone|ous a po&s;ition, which has not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of rea&s;on for its foundation, and which a &s;mall &s;hare of ob&s;ervation will prove to be fal&s;e in fact. A man who has been long conver&s;ant with the wor&s;t &s;ort of women, is very apt to contract a bad opinion of and a contempt for the &s;ex in ge|neral. Incapable of e&s;teeming any, he is &s;u&s;pi|cious of all, jealous without cau&s;e, angry with|out provocation, and his own di&s;turbed imagina|tion is a continual &s;ource of ill humour. To this is frequently joined a bad habit of body, the natural con&s;equence of an irregular life, which gives an additional &s;ourne&s;s to the temper. What rational pro&s;pect of happine&s;s can there be with &s;uch a companion? And that this is the general character of tho&s;e who are called reformed rakes, ob&s;ervation will certify&mdash;But, admit there may be &s;ome exceptions, it is a hazard upon which no con&s;iderate women would venture the peace of her whole future life. The vanity of tho&s;e girls who believe them&s;elves capable of working mira|cles of this kind, and who give up their per&s;ons to men of libertine principles, upon the wild ex|pectation of reclaiming them, ju&s;tly de&s;erves the di&s;appointment which it will generally meet with; for, believe me, a wife is, of all per&s;ons, the lea&s;t likely to &s;ucceed in &s;uch an attempt. Be it your care to find that virtue in a lover which you mu&s;t

never hope to form in a hu&s;band. Good-&s;en&s;e and good-nature are almo&s;t equally requi&s;ite. If the former is wanting, it will be next to impo&s;&s;i|ble for you to e&s;teem the per&s;on of who&s;e behavi|our you may have cau&s;e to be a&s;hamed; and mu|tual e&s;teem is as nece&s;&s;ary to happine&s;s in the married &s;tate as mutual affection: without the latter, every day will bring with it &s;ome fre&s;h cau&s;e of vexation; 'till repeated quarrels produce a coldne&s;s, which will &s;ettle into an irreconcile|able aver&s;ion, and you will become not only each other's torment, but the object of contempt to your family and to your acquaintance.</P>
<P>This quality of Good-Nature is, of all others, the mo&s;t difficult to be a&s;certained, on account of the general mi&s;take of blending it with Good-Humour, as if they were in them&s;elves the &s;ame; whereas, in fact, no two principles of action are more e&s;&s;entially different. And this may require &s;ome explanation.&mdash;By Good-Nature I mean, that true benevolence which partakes the felicity of all mankind; which promotes the &s;atisfaction or every individual within the reach of its abi|lity; which relieves the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, comforts the afflicted, diffu&s;es ble&s;&s;ings, and communicates happine&s;s, as far as its &s;phere of action can extend, and which, in the private &s;cenes of life, will &s;hine con&s;picuous in the dutiful &s;on, the affec|tionate hu&s;band, the indulgent father, the faith|ful friend, and the compa&s;&s;ionate ma&s;ter both to man and bea&s;t: whil&s;t Good-Humour is nothing more than a cheerful, plea&s;ing deportment, ari&s;ing either from a natural gaiety of mind, or from an affectation of popularity, joined to an affability <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> behaviour, the re&s;ult of good-breeding, and a ready compliance with the ta&s;te of every company.
<PB N="92" REF="025067_0088_0FCE4A674D6D4568">
This kind of mere good-humour is, by far, the mo&s;t &s;triking quality; 'tis frequently mi&s;taken for, and complimented with, the &s;uperior name of real good-nature. A man by this &s;pecious ap|pearance has often acquired that appellation, who, in all the actions of his private life, has been a moro&s;e, cruel, revengeful, &s;ullen, haughty tyrant. Let them put on the cap who&s;e temples fit the gal|ling wreath! On the contrary, a man of a truly benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, and formed to promote the happine&s;s of all round him, may &s;ometimes, perhaps from an ill habit of body, an accidental vexation, or from a commendable openne&s;s of heart above the meanne&s;s of di&s;gui&s;e, be guilty of little &s;allies of peevi&s;hne&s;s, or of ill-humour, which, carrying the appearance of ill nature, may be unju&s;tly thought to proceed from it, by per&s;ons who are unacquainted with his true charac|ter, and who take ill humour and ill-nature to be &s;ynonimous terms, though in reality they bear not the lea&s;t analogy to each other. In order to the forming a right judgment, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve this di&s;tinction, which will effectually &s;ecure you from the dangerous error of taking the &s;hadow for the &s;ub&s;tance; an irre|trievable mi&s;take, pregnant with innumerable con|&s;equent evils!</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid it plainly appears, that the criterion of this amiable virtue is not to be taken from the general opinion; mere good-humour being, to all intents and purpo&s;es, &s;uf|ficient in this particular to e&s;tabli&s;h the public voice in favour of a man utterly devoid o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> every humane and benevolent affection of heart. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is only from the le&s;s con&s;picuous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> more retired &s;phere of action, from the art <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

The be&s;t method, therefore, to avoid the deception in this ca&s;e, is to lay no &s;tre&s;s on outward appear|ances, which are too often fallacious, but to take the rule of judging from the &s;imple, unpoli&s;hed &s;entiments of tho&s;e, who&s;e dependent connections give them an undeniable certainty; who not only &s;ee, but hourly feel the good or bad effects of that di&s;po&s;ition to which they are &s;ubjected. By this I mean, that if a man is equally re&s;pected, e&s;teemed, and beloved by his tenants, by his de|pendents and dome&s;tics; from the &s;ub&s;tantial farmer to the laborious pea&s;ant: from the proud &s;teward to the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive wretch, who, thankful for employment, humbly obeys the mental tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> you may ju&s;tly conclude he has that true good-nature, that real benevolence, which delights in communicating felicity, and enjoys the &s;atisfaction it diffu&s;es.

<P>Remember, however, that infallibility is not the property of man, or you may entail di&s;ap|pointment on your&s;elf, by expecting what is never to be found. The be&s;t men are &s;ometimes incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves. They are liable to be hurried by &s;udden &s;tarts of pa&s;&s;ion into expre&s;|&s;ions and actions which their cooler rea&s;on will condemn. They may have &s;ome oddities of be|haviour, &s;ome peculiarities of temper; they may be &s;ubject to accidental ill-humour, or to whim|&s;ical complaints: blemi&s;hes of this kind often &s;hade the brighte&s;t character, but they are never de&s;tructive of mutual felicity, unle&s;s when they are made &s;o by an improper re&s;entment, or by an ill-judged oppo&s;ition. Rea&s;on can never be heard by pa&s;&s;ion; the offer of it tends only to enflame the more. When cooled, and in his u&s;ual tem|per, the man of under&s;tanding, if he has been wrong, will &s;ugge&s;t to him&s;elf all that could be urged again&s;t him: the man of good nature will, unupbraided, own his error: immediate contra|diction is, therefore, wholly un&s;erviceable, and highly imprudent; an after repetition equally unnece&s;&s;ary and injudicious. Any peculiarities in the temper or behaviour ought to be properly repre&s;ented in the tendere&s;t and in the mo&s;t friend|ly manner, and if the repre&s;entation of them is made di&s;creetly, it will generally be well taken: but if they are &s;o habitual as not ea&s;ily to be altered, &s;trike not too often upon the unharmo|nious &s;tring; rather let them pa&s;s as unob&s;erved: &s;uch a chearful compliance will better c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ment

In this ca&s;e, no farther direction is nece&s;&s;ary, but that you &s;trictly perform the duty of a wife, namely, to love, to honour and obey. The two fir&s;t articles are a tribute &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ibly due to merit, that they mu&s;t be paid by inclina|tion; and they naturally lead to the performance of the la&s;t, which will not only be an ea&s;y, but a plea&s;ing ta&s;k, &s;ince nothing can ever be enjoined by &s;uch a per&s;on that is in it&s;elf improper, and few things will, that can with any rea&s;on be di&s;agreeable to you.</P>
<P>Here &s;hould this &s;ubject end, were it not more than po&s;&s;ible for you, after all that has been urged, to be led by &s;ome inferior motive to the neglect of the primary caution; and that, either from an opinion too ha&s;tily entertained, from an unaccountable partiality, or from the powerful prevalence of per&s;ua&s;ion, you may be unfortu|nately induced to give your hand to a man who&s;e bad heart and moro&s;e temper, concealed by a well-practi&s;ed di&s;&s;imulation, may render every flattering hope of hapine&s;s abortive.&mdash;May Hea|ven, in mercy, guard you from this fatal error!

<P>The being united to a man of irreligious prin|ciples makes it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;charge a great part of the proper duty of a wife.

This is not &s;uppo&s;ition, but is founded upon facts, which I have too often &s;een and can atte&s;t. Where this happens, the rea&s;ons for non|compliance ought to be offered in a plain, &s;trong, good-natured manner; there is at lea&s;t the chance of &s;ucce&s;s from being heard; but &s;hould tho&s;e rea&s;ons be rejected, or the hearing of them be refu&s;ed, and &s;ilence on the &s;ubject enjoined&mdash;which is mo&s;t probable, few people caring to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> what they know to be right, when determined not to appear convinced by it&mdash;obey the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">c|tion, and urge not the argument, farther: keep, however, &s;teady to your principles, and &s;uffer neither per&s;ua&s;ion nor threats to prevail on you to act contrary to them.

duty to di&s;obey; all reque&s;ts that are incon&s;i&s;tent with prudence, or incompatible with the rank and character which you ought to maintain in life, it is your intere&s;t to refu&s;e. A compliance with the former would be criminal; a con&s;ent to the latter highly indi&s;creet; and it might thereby &s;ubject you to general cen&s;ure: for a man capable of requiring from his wife what he knows to be in it&s;elf wrong, is equally capable of throwing the whole blame of &s;uch mi&s;conduct on her, and of afterwards upbraiding her for a behaviour to which he will, upon the &s;ame principle, di&s;own that he has been acce&s;&s;ary. Many &s;imilar in|&s;tances have come within the compa&s;s of my own ob&s;ervation. In things of a le&s;s material nature, that are neither criminal in them&s;elves nor perni|cious in their con&s;equences, always acquie&s;ce, if in&s;i&s;ted on, however di&s;agreeable they may be to your own temper and inclination. Such a com|pliance will evidently prove that your refu&s;al, in the other ca&s;es, proceeds not from a &s;pirit of con|tradiction, but merely from a ju&s;t regard to that &s;uperior duty, which can never be infringed with impunity. Pa&s;&s;ion may re&s;ent, but rea&s;on mu&s;t ap|prove this conduct; and therefore it is the mo&s;t likely method, in time, to make a favourable im|pre&s;&s;ion.

the more &s;upportable will it be to tho&s;e who are under its baneful influence. When all endea|vours to plea&s;e are ineffectual, and when a man &s;eems determined to find fault with every thing, as if his chief plea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ted in tormenting tho&s;e about him, it requires a more than common degree of patience and re&s;olution to forbear ut|tering reproaches, which &s;uch a behaviour may be ju&s;tly allowed to de&s;erve: yet it is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the maintaining any tolerable degree of ea&s;e, not only to re&s;train all expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;entment, but to withhold even tho&s;e di&s;dainful looks which are apt to accompany a contemptu|ous &s;ilence; and they both equally tend only to encrea&s;e the malady. This infernal delight in giving pain is mo&s;t unwearied in the &s;earch of matter for its gratification, and can either find, or unaccountably can form it, in almo&s;t all the occurrences of life; but, when &s;uffered unob|&s;tructed and unregarded to run its malicious cour&s;e, it will quickly vent its blunted arrows, and will die of di&s;appointment; whil&s;t all endea|vours to appea&s;e, all complaints of unkindne&s;s will but &s;harpen again&s;t your&s;elf the weapon's edge, and, by proving your &s;en&s;ibility of the wound, will give the wi&s;hed-for &s;atisfaction to him who inflicts it. Prudence, in this ca&s;e, di|rects more than ordinary circum&s;pection, that every part of your behaviour may be as blame|le&s;s as po&s;&s;ible, even to the ab&s;taining from the lea&s;t appearance of evil; and after you have, to the utmo&s;t of your power, &s;trove to merit appro|bation, expect not to meet with it: by the&s;e means you will e&s;cape the mortification of being di&s;appointed, which, often repeated, is apt to give a gloomy &s;ourne&s;s to the temper, incompa|tible

<P>A woman can never be &s;een in a more ridicu|lous light than when &s;he appears to govern her hu&s;band. If, unfortunately, the &s;uperiority of under&s;tanding is on her &s;ide, the apparent con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of that &s;uperiority betrays a weakne&s;s that renders her contemptible in the fight of every con|&s;iderate per&s;on, and it may, very probably, fix in his mind a di&s;like never to be eradicated. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, if it &s;hould ever be your own, remember that &s;ome degree of di&s;&s;imulation is commendable, &s;o far as to let your hu&s;band's defect appear un|ob&s;erved.

ADVICE of a MOTHER TO HER DAUGHTER.</HEAD>
<P>THE world has in all ages been very negligent in the education of daughters; all their care is laid out entirely upon the men; and as if the women were a di&s;tinct &s;pecies, they leave them to them&s;elves without any helps, without think|ing that they compo&s;e one half of the world; that the two &s;exes are nece&s;&s;arily united together by alliances; that the women make either the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of the men, who always feel the want of having them rea&s;onable; that they are a great means of the ri&s;e and ruin of families; that they are entru&s;ted with the education of the children in their early youth, a &s;ea&s;on of life in which they receive the livelie&s;t and deepe&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ions. What would they have them in&s;pire into their children, when from their very infancy they are left them&s;elves in the hands of gover|nantes, who, as they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> generally taken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t of the low world, in&s;pire them with low &s;entiments,
<PB N="121" REF="025067_0116_0FCE4AEA6C1E4020">
encourage all the timorous pa&s;&s;ions, and form them to &s;uper&s;tition in&s;tead of religion. 'Twould be a &s;ubject worthier of their thoughts to contrive how to make certain vices hereditary to their fa|milies, by conveying them down from the mother to the children, than how to &s;ecure their e&s;tates by entails. Nothing therefore is &s;o much mi&s;|taken as the education which they give to young women: they de&s;ign them to plea&s;e; they give them no in&s;tructions but for the ornament and graces of the body; they flatter their &s;elf-love; they give them up to effeminacy, to the world, and to fal&s;e opinions; they give them no lectures o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> virtue and fortitude: &s;urely it is unrea&s;onable or rather downright madne&s;s to imagine that &s;uch an education &s;hould not turn to their pre|judice.</P>
<P>It may be nece&s;&s;ary, my Daughter, to ob&s;erve all the outward rules of <HI>Decorum;</HI> but this is not enough to gain you the e&s;teem of the world; 'tis the &s;entiments of the mind that form the cha|racter of a per&s;on; that lead the under&s;tanding; that govern the will; that &s;ecure the reality and duration of all our virtues: but religion &s;hould be the principle and foundation of the&s;e &s;enti|ments. When religion is once engraven on our heart, all the virtues will naturally flow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that &s;ource; all the duties of life will be regularly practi&s;ed in their re&s;pective order. 'Tis not enough for the conduct of young per&s;ons to oblige them to do their duty; they mu&s;t be brought to love it. Authority is a tyrant only over the outward behaviour, it has no &s;way over the in|ward &s;entiments. When one pre&s;cribes a conduct, we &s;hould repre&s;ent the rea&s;ons and the motives
<PB N="122" REF="025067_0117_0FCE4ABA69B6AE30">
of it, and give them a reli&s;h for what we advi&s;e them.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;o much for our intere&s;t to practi&s;e virtue, that we &s;hould never con&s;ider it as our enemy, but rather as the &s;ource of happine&s;s, of glory, and of peace.</P>
<P>You are ju&s;t coming into the world; enter it, my daughter, with &s;ome principles; you cannot fortify your&s;elf too much again&s;t what you will meet with there: bring along with you all your religion; nou|ri&s;h it in your heart by your &s;entiments; confirm it in your mind by proper reflections, and by reading adapted to encourage it.</P>
<P>There is nothing more nece&s;&s;ary, and indeed more happy for us than to keep up a &s;entiment that makes us love and hope; that gives us a pro&s;pect of an agreeable futurity; that reconciles all times; that in&s;ures all the duties of life; that an&s;wers for us to our&s;elves, and is our gua|rantee with regard to others. What a &s;upport will you find from religion under the mi&s;fortunes that threaten you! for a certain number of mi&s;|fortunes mu&s;t fall to your &s;hare. 'Twas a &s;aying of one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, "That he wrapped him&s;elf up in the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">his Virtue:" Wrap your&s;elf up in that of your Religion; it will be a great help to you again&s;t the weakne&s;s of youth, and a &s;ure re|fuge in your riper years.</P>
<P>Women that have cultivated their under&s;tand|ing with nothing but the maxims of the world, are pre&s;ented at la&s;t with an univer&s;al blank, and find them&s;elves in a terrible want of thought and employment, the mo&s;t irk&s;ome &s;ituation in life. As they advance in age the world quits them, and rea&s;on tells them they &s;hould quit the world; but where mu&s;t they go for relief? The time pa&s;t
<PB N="123" REF="025067_0118_0FCE4AEBE7E2AD98">
furni&s;hes us with regrets, the pre&s;ent with inqui|etudes, and the time to come with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ears. Religion alone calms all our unea&s;ine&s;s, and comforts us under all misfortunes; by uniting you to God, it reconciles you with the world, and your|&s;elf too.</P>
<P>A young per&s;on when &s;he comes into the world frames to her&s;elf an high notion of the happine&s;s re&s;erved for her. She &s;ets her&s;elf to obtain it; 'tis the &s;ource of all her cares. She is always on the hunt after her notion, and in hopes of finding a perfect happine&s;s: this is the occa&s;ion of lightne&s;s and incon&s;tancy.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ures of the world are deceitful; they promi&s;e more than they perform; the que&s;t of them is full of anxiety: their enjoyment is far from yielding any true &s;atisfaction, and their lo&s;s is attended with vexation.</P>
<P>To fix your de&s;ires, think that no &s;olid or la&s;t|ing happine&s;s is to be found any where but in your own brea&s;t. Honours and riches have no charms that are la&s;ting for any length of time; their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion extends our view, and gives us new de&s;ires. Plea&s;ures when they grow familiar, lo&s;e their reli&s;h. Before you have ta&s;ted them, you may do without them; whereas enjoyment makes that nece&s;&s;ary to you, which was once &s;uperfluous, and you are wor&s;e at your ea&s;e than you were before; by enjoying them you grow u&s;ed to them, and when you lo&s;e them, they leave you nothing but emptine&s;s and want. What affects us &s;en&s;ibly is the pa&s;|&s;age from one circum&s;tance of life to another; the interval between a mi&s;erable &s;ea&s;on and a happy one. The &s;en&s;e of plea&s;ure wears off as &s;oon as we grow habituated to it. 'Twould be a

great advantage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f rea&s;on could a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> once lay before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s all that is nece&s;&s;ary for our happine&s;s. Expe|rience brings us back to our&s;elves; &s;pare your&s;elf that expence, and lay it early down for a a maxim, with a firmne&s;s and re&s;olution to determine your conduct, that "true felicity con&s;i&s;ts in peace of mind, in rea&s;on, and in the di&s;charge of our duty." Let us not fancy our&s;elves happy, my Daughter, till we feel our plea&s;ures of this &s;ort flow from the bottom of our &s;oul.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections &s;eem too &s;trong for a young per&s;on, and are proper for a riper age: however, I believe you capable of them; and be&s;ides, I am in&s;tructing my&s;elf&punc; We cannot engrave the pre|cepts of wi&s;dom too deeply in our hearts; the impre&s;&s;ions that they make are always too light; but it can't be denied th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> u&s;e them&s;elves to make reflections, and fortify their hearts with principles, are in a fairer way to virtue than &s;uch as neglect them. If we are unhappy enough to be detective in the practice of our duty, let us a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> lea&s;t not be wanting in our affections to it: let us then, my Daughter, make u&s;e of the&s;e precepts for a continual help to our virtue.</P>
<P>'Tis commonly &s;aid there are two prejudices with which every body mu&s;t comply; Religion and Hon|our. 'Tis a wrong expre&s;&s;ion to call Religion a prejudice. A prejudice is an opinion that may be &s;ub&s;ervient to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as well as truth: the term ought never to be applied but to things that are uncertain; and Religion is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o.</P>
<P>Honour is indeed an invention merely human; yet nothing is more real than the evils that people &s;uffer who would get rid of it; 'twould be dan|gerous to &s;hake it off; we &s;hould rather do all we can to fortify, a &s;entiment that ought to be a rule
<PB N="125" REF="025067_0120_0FCE4AEFC9DBE918">
to our conduct, &s;ince nothing is more de&s;tructive o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> our quiet, or makes our life more unequal, than to think one way and act another. Po&s;&s;e&s;s your heart as much as is po&s;&s;ible with &s;entiments for the conduct that you ought to ob&s;erve; fortify this prejudice of Honour in your mind; you cannot be too &s;crupu|lou&s;ly nice on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Never warp in the lea&s;t from the&s;e principles; never entertain a notion, as if the virtue of wo|men was a virtue only enjoined by cu&s;tom; nor al|low your&s;elf to think you have &s;ufficiently di&s;charg|ed your obligations, if you can but e&s;cape the eyes of the world. There are two courts before which you mu&s;t inevitably appear in judgment, your Con|&s;cience and the World; you may po&s;&s;ibly get clear of the World, but you can never get clear of Con|&s;cience. Secure her te&s;timony in favour of your hone&s;ty; 'tis what you owe to your&s;elf; but withal do not neglect the approbation of the public, for a contempt of reputation naturally leads to a contempt of virtue.</P>
<P>When you are a little acquainted with the world, you will find that there is no need of the &s;anctions and terror of laws to keep you within the bounds of your duty; the example of &s;uch as have deviated from it, and the calamities that have ever attended them, is enough to &s;top any inclination in the mid&s;t of its career; for there is no coquet but mu&s;t own, if &s;he would be &s;incere, that it is the greate&s;t misfortune in the world to be forgot and neglected.</P>
<P>Shame is a pa&s;&s;ion that might be of excellent advantage to us, if we managed it well: I do not mean th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> fal&s;e &s;hame which only &s;erves to di&s;turb our quiet, without being of any &s;ervice to our behaviour; I &s;peak of that which keeps
<PB N="126" REF="025067_0121_0FCE4ABEF8B3A000">
us from evil out of fear of di&s;honour: we mu&s;t con|fe&s;s this &s;hame is &s;ometimes the &s;ure&s;t guard of the women's virtue; there are very few virtuous for virtue it&s;elf.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome great virtues, which, when they are carried to a certain degree, make a great many defects be over-looked; &s;uch as extraordinary va|lour in the men, and extreme mode&s;ty in the wo|men. Agrippina, the wife of Germanicus, was ex|cu&s;ed of all her faults on account of her cha&s;tity. This Prince&s;s was ambitious and haughty; but, &s;ays Tacitus, <Q>all her pa&s;&s;ions were con&s;ecrated by her cha&s;tity.</Q></P>
<P>If you are &s;en&s;ible and nice in the point of reputation, if you are apprehen&s;ive of being attack|ed as to e&s;&s;ential virtues, there is one &s;ure means to calm your fears and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> your nicety; 'tis to be virtuous. Make it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> great care to refine your &s;entiments: let them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e rea&s;onable and full of honour. Be &s;ure always to keep well with your&s;elf; 'tis a &s;ure income of plea&s;ures; and will gain you prai&s;e, and a good reputation to boot: in a word, be but truly virtuous, and you'll find admirers enough.</P>
<P>The virtues that make a figure in the world do not fall to the women's &s;hare; their virtues are of a &s;imple and peaceable nature: Fame will have nothing to do with us. 'Twas a &s;aying of one of the Antients, that <Q>the great virtues are for the men!</Q> he allows the women nothing but the &s;ingle merit of being unknown; and <Q>&s;uch as are mo&s;t prai&s;ed, (&s;ays he) are not always the per&s;ons that de&s;erve it be&s;t; but rather &s;uch as are not talked of at all.</Q> The notion &s;eems to me to be wrong; but to reduce this maxim into prac|tice, I think it be&s;t to avoid the world, and mak|ing
<PB N="127" REF="025067_0122_0FCE4AF1E1FF8D60">
a figure, which always &s;trike at mode&s;ty, and he contented with being one's own &s;pectator.</P>
<P>The virtues of the women are difficult, becau&s;e they have no help from glory to practi&s;e them. To live at home; to meddle with nothing but one's &s;elf and family; to be &s;imple, ju&s;t, and mode&s;t, are painful virtues, becau&s;e they are ob|&s;cure. One mu&s;t have a great deal of merit to &s;hun making a figure, and a great deal of cou|rage to bring one's &s;elf to be virtuous only to one's own eyes. Grandeur and reputation &s;erve for &s;upports to our weakne&s;s, for &s;uch in reality is our de&s;ire to di&s;tingui&s;h and rai&s;e our&s;elves. The mind re&s;ts in the public approbation, but true glory con&s;i&s;ts in being &s;atisfied without it. Let it not enter then into the motives of your actions; 'tis enough that it is the recompence of them.</P>
<P>Be a&s;&s;ured, my Daughter, that perfection and happine&s;s cling together; that you can never be happy but by virtue, and &s;carce ever unhappy but by ill conduct. Whoever examines them|&s;elves &s;trictly, will find that they never had any grievous affliction, but they occa&s;ioned it them|&s;elves by &s;ome fault, or by being wanting in &s;ome duty. Anxiety always follows the lo&s;s of innocence; but virtue is ever attended with an in|ward &s;atisfaction, that is a con&s;tant &s;pring of felicity to all its votaries.</P>
<P>Do not however imagine that your only virtue is mode&s;ty; there are abundance of women that have no notion of any other, and fancy, that by practi&s;ing it they di&s;charge all the duties of &s;ocie|ty: they think they have a right to neglect all the re&s;t, and to be as proud and cen&s;orious as they plea&s;e. Anne of Bretagne, a proud and imperious Prince&s;s, made Lewis XII. &s;uffer ex|ceedingly;

<P>Be very cautious on the article of plays, and the like public diver&s;ions. There is no dignity in &s;hewing one's &s;elf continually, nor is it an ea&s;y matter to pre&s;erve a &s;trict mode&s;ty in a con&s;tant hurry of diver&s;ions. It is mi&s;taking one's intere&s;t to frequent them: if you have beauty, you mu&s;t not wear out the ta&s;te of the world by &s;hewing your&s;elf continually: you mu&s;t be &s;till more re|&s;erved if you want graces to &s;et you off; be&s;ides the con&s;tant u&s;e of diver&s;ions le&s;&s;ons the reli&s;h of them.</P>
<P>When all your life has been &s;pent in plea&s;ures, and they come to leave you, either becau&s;e your ta&s;te for them is over, or becau&s;e your rea&s;on for|bids you the enjoyment of them, your mind finds it&s;elf in a mo&s;t unea&s;y &s;ituation for want of em|ployment. If you would therefore have your plea&s;ures and amu&s;ements la&s;t, u&s;e them only as diver&s;ions to relieve you after more &s;erious occu|pations. Entertain your&s;elf with your own rea|&s;on;

keep up that corre&s;pondence, and the ab&s;ence of plea&s;ures will not leave you any time upon your hands nor any hankering after them.</P>
<P>It behoves us therefore to hu&s;band our ta&s;tes; there is no reli&s;hing life without them, but innocence only can pre&s;erve them in their integrity; irregu|larity is &s;ure to deprave them.</P>
<P>When we have a &s;ound heart, we make an advantage of every thing, and turn it into a &s;ource of plea&s;ure. We come frequently to plea|&s;ures with a &s;ick man's palate; we fancy our|&s;elves nince, when we are only &s;urfeited and ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of ta&s;te. When we have not &s;poiled our mind and heart by &s;entiments that &s;educe the fancy, or by any flaming pa&s;&s;ion, it is ea&s;y to find delight: health and innocence are the true fountains of joy. But when we have had the misfortune to habituate our&s;elves to vehement plea&s;ures, we become in&s;en|&s;ible to moderate ones. We &s;poil our ta&s;te by di|ver&s;ions, and u&s;e our&s;elves &s;o much to violent plea|&s;ures, that we cannot take up with &s;uch an are &s;imple and regular.</P>
<P>We &s;hould always dread &s;uch great emotions of the &s;oul as leave us flat and out of &s;orts. Young per&s;ons have the greater rea&s;on to fear them, in that they are le&s;s capable of re&s;i&s;ting what flatters their &s;en&s;e. "Temperance," &s;aid one of the Antients, <Q>is the be&s;t caterer for lux|ury.</Q> With this temperance, which makes the health both of mind and body, one has always a plea&s;ing and an equal joy; one has no need of diver&s;ions and expence; reading, work, and con|ver&s;ation, afford a purer joy than all the train of the greate&s;t plea&s;ures. In a word, innocent de|lights are of mo&s;t advantage; they are always ready at hand; they are beneficient, and are never

purcha&s;ed at too dear a rate. Other plea&s;ures flatter, but they do mi&s;chief: they alter the con|&s;titution of the mind, and &s;poil it like that of the body.</P>
<P>Be regular in all your views and in all your actions; it would be happy if our fortune was &s;uch as to make computations of our income unne|ce&s;&s;ary; but as yours is narrow, it obliges us to be regular. Be di&s;creet in the article of your ex|pences; if you do not ob&s;erve a moderation in them, you will &s;oon &s;ee your affairs in di&s;order; as &s;oon as you lay a&s;ide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">economy, you can an|&s;wer for nothing.</P>
<P>Pompous living is the high road to ruin, and the ruin of people's fortune is almo&s;t always fol|lowed with corruption of manners: but in order to be regular, it is no way nece&s;&s;ary to be covet|ous. Remember that avarice is of little &s;ervice, and di&s;honours a per&s;on infinitely. All that one &s;hould aim at in a regular management, is to avoid the &s;hame and inju&s;tice that always attend an irregular conduct. We mu&s;t retrench &s;uper|fluous expences only to be a better condition to afford &s;uch as decency, friend&s;hip and charity en|gage us to make.</P>
<P>It is good order, and not the looking into little matters, that turns to any great account.

to gratify the &s;entiments of genero&s;ity, which every per&s;on of a genteel &s;pirit ought to have.</P>
<P>Never mind the wants that vanity creates. "We mu&s;t be," they &s;ay, "like others;" this <HI>like</HI> goes a va&s;t way. Have a noble emulation, and allow nobody to have more honour, probi|ty, and integrity than your&s;elf.

You fancy it is a mere amu&s;ement; it is only the per&s;on's wit or good &s;en&s;e that plea&s;es us. In a word, Love is almo&s;t always unknown till he has got the ma&s;tery. As &s;oon as he comes to be felt, fly that in&s;tant, and hearken not to the complaints of your heart: Love is not rooted out of the &s;oul with ordinary efforts, it has too many partizans within us: as &s;oon as it has &s;urprized you, every thing is on its &s;ide again&s;t you, and nothing will &s;erve you again&s;t Love. It is the mo&s;t cruel &s;ituation a rational per&s;on can be in; where there is nothing to &s;upport you; where you have no &s;pectator but your&s;elf. You mu&s;t &s;ummon up your courage immediately, and re|member

<P>Reflect upon the fatal con&s;equences of pa&s;&s;ions, and you will find but too many examples to in|&s;truct you; but we are often convinced of our mi&s;take, without being cured of our pa&s;&s;ion.

Nothing deba&s;es you to &s;uch a degree, and &s;inks you to much below your&s;elf, as the Pa&s;&s;ions: they degrade you: there is no|thing but rea&s;on that can maintain your dignity. It is far more unhappy to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> need of one's courage to bear a misfortune, than to void it; the plea&s;ure of doing one's duty is a comfort to you; but never applaud your&s;elf, for fear of be|ing humbled.

<P>Borrow forces and &s;uccour from your enemy and the very nature of Love; if you would not fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tter him, he will &s;upply you with them.

<P>Let us now pa&s;s, my daughter, to the Social Duties.

<P>The fir&s;t duty of civil life is to take care of others; &s;uch as live only for them&s;elves fall into contempt, and are neglected by every body. If you are for requiring too much from others, they will refu&s;e you every thing, their friend&s;hip, their affections, and their &s;ervices. Civil life is a mutual intercour&s;e of good offices: the mo&s;t valuable part of mankind go &s;till further: by promoting the

<P>Nothing can be more odious than people that make every body &s;ee that they live only for them&s;elves. An extravagant &s;elf-love is the &s;ource of great crimes; &s;ome degrees lower it occa&s;ions vices; but let there be never &s;o little a &s;pice of it in a per&s;on, it impairs all the virtues and charms of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to make a friend&s;hip with per|&s;ons who have a predominant &s;elf-love, and take care to &s;hew it; and yet we can never &s;trip our|&s;elves of it entirely; as long as we are attached to life, we &s;hall be attached to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>But the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> is a qualified &s;elf-love, that is not ex|erci&s;ed at the ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ce of others.</P>
<P>We fancy we exalt our&s;elves by depre&s;&s;ing our equals: th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s makes us cen&s;orious and envious. Good-nature turns to more account than malig|nity. Do good when it is in your power; &s;peak well of all the world, and never judge with rigour. Such acts of goodne&s;s and genero&s;ity frequently repeated will gain you at la&s;t a great and excellent reputation. All the world is engaged to com|mend you, to extenuate your defects, and enhance your good qualities. You &s;hould found your reputation upon your own virtues, and not upon the demerit of others; con&s;ider that their good qualities take nothing at all from you, and that the diminution of your reputation can be imputed to no body but your&s;elf.</P>
<P>One of the things that contributes mo&s;t to make us unhappy is, that we depend too much upon the men; 'tis the &s;ource too of our inju&s;|tice. We pick quarrels with them, not on account of what they owe us, or of that they have pro|mi&s;ed

<P>Civility, which is an imitation of charity, is another of the &s;ocial virtues: it puts you above others when you have it in a more eminent de|gree; but it is practi&s;ed and maintained at the ex|pence of &s;elf-love. Civility is always borrowing &s;omething from your&s;elf, and turning it to the ad|vantage of others.

<P>Pride keeps us off from &s;ociety: our &s;elf love gives us a peculiar rank, which is always di&s;|puted with us.

Con|ver&s;ation in the world is enough to poli&s;h our outward behaviour; but there mu&s;t be a good deal of delicacy to form a politene&s;s of mind. A nice politene&s;s formed with art and ta&s;te, will

make the world excu&s;e you a great many failings, and improve your good qualities. Such as are defective in point of behaviour have the greater need of &s;olid qualities, and make &s;low advances in gaining a reputation. In a word, politene&s;s co&s;ts but little, and is of va&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>Silence always becomes a young per&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> is a mode&s;ty and dignity in keeping it; you fit in judgment upon others, and run no hazard your|&s;elf: but guard your&s;elf again&s;t a proud and in&s;ulting &s;ilence; it &s;hould be the re&s;ult of your prudence, and not the con&s;equence of your pride. But as there is no holding our peace always, it is fit for us to know that the principal rule for &s;peaking well is to think well.</P>
<P>When your notions are clear and di&s;tinct, your di&s;cour&s;e will be &s;o too; let a proper decorum and mode&s;ty run through them. In all your di&s;cour&s;es pay a regard to received cu&s;toms and prejudices; expre&s;&s;ions declare the &s;entiments of the heart, and the &s;entiments form the beha|viour.</P>
<P>Be particularly careful not to &s;et up for a joker; 'tis an ill part to act, and by making others laugh, we &s;eldom make our&s;elves e&s;teemed. Pay a great deal more attention to others than to your&s;elf, and think how to &s;et them out rather than to &s;hine your&s;elf: we &s;hould learn how to li&s;ten to other people's di&s;cour&s;e, and not betray an ab&s;ence of mind either by our eyes or our manner. Never dwell upon &s;tories: if you chance to tell any, do it in a genteel and clo&s;e manner; let what you &s;ay be new, or at lea&s;t give it a new turn. The world is full of people, that are dinning things into your ears, without
<PB N="162" REF="025067_0157_0FCE4B22CF652980">
&s;aying any thing to entertain the mind. When|ever we &s;peak, we &s;hould take care either to plea&s;e or in&s;truct; when you call for the attention of the company, you &s;hould make them amends by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> agreeablene&s;s of what you &s;ay: an indif|ferent di&s;cour&s;e cannot be too &s;hort.</P>
<P>You may approve what you hear but &s;hould very &s;eldom admire it: admiration is proper to blockheads. Never let your di&s;cour&s;e have an air of art and cunning; the greate&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">dence lies in &s;peaking little, and &s;hewing more diffidence of one's &s;elf than of other people. An upright conduct, and a reputation for p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ity, gains more confidence and e&s;teem, and at the long run more advantages too in point of fortune, than any by ways. Nothing makes you &s;o worthy of the greate&s;t matters, and rai&s;es you &s;o much above others, as an exact probity.</P>
<P>U&s;e your&s;elf to treat your &s;erva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> with kind|ne&s;s and humanity. 'Tis a &s;aying of one of the Antients, <Q>that we ought to con&s;ider them as unhappy friends.</Q> Remember that the va&s;t difference between you and them is owing merely to chance; never make them unea&s;y in their &s;tate of life, or add weight to the trouble of it. There is nothing &s;o poor and mean as to be haughty to any body that is in your &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Never u&s;e any har&s;h language; it &s;hould never come out of the mouth of a delicate and polite per&s;on. Servitude being &s;ettled in oppo&s;ition to the natural equality of mankind, it behoves us to &s;often it. What right have we to expect our &s;ervants &s;hould be without faults, when we are giving them in&s;tances every day of our own? Let us rather bear with them. When you &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w

A mean familiarity with them i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> indeed ever to be avoided; but you owe them a&s;&s;i&s;tance, advice, and bounties &s;uitable to their condition and wants.</P>
<P>One &s;hould keep up authority in one's family, but it &s;hould be a mild authority. We &s;hould not indeed always threaten without puni&s;hing, for fear of bringing our treats into contempt; but we &s;hould not call in authority till per&s;ua&s;ion has failed. Remember that humanity and chri&s;tiani|ty put all the world on the &s;ame foot. The im|patience and heat of youth, joined to the fal&s;e no|tion they give you of your&s;elf, make you look upon your &s;ervants as creatures of a different &s;pe|cies; but how contrary are &s;uch &s;entiments to the mode&s;ty that you owe to your&s;elf, and the hu|manity you owe to others.</P>
<P>Never reli&s;h or encourage the flattery of &s;er|vants; and to prevent the impre&s;&s;ion which their fawning &s;peeches frequently repeated may make upon you, con&s;ider that they are hirelings paid to &s;erve your weakne&s;&s;es and pride.</P>
<P>If by misfortune, Daughter, you &s;hould not think &s;it to follow my Advice and Precepts, though they be lo&s;t upon you, they will &s;till be u&s;eful to my&s;elf, as laying me under new obliga|tions.
