<BIBL>MATT. XXV. 21.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>HIS LORD &s;aid unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful Servant; thou ha&s;t been faithful&mdash;</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THIS is part of our Saviour's well-known parable of the talents; the moral of which is in general this, That whatever powers and advantages of any kind, men &s;everally enjoy, are committed to them in tru&s;t by the great Lord and Proprietor of all, to whom they are accountable for the u&s;e they make of them; and from whom they &s;hall, in the clo&s;e of this pre&s;ent &s;cene, receive either a glorious recompence of
<PB N="2" REF="007256_0005_102B46673AA1B848">
their fidelity, or the puni&s;hment due to their &s;loth and wickedne&s;s. The &s;ubject, then, is very general, and equally intere&s;ting. All men, of whatever rank or character, are concerned in it. It leads our thoughts from what we po&s;&s;e&s;s, up to the great &s;ource thereof; from what we are at pre&s;ent, to what we &s;hall be here|after. It connects this world with another; and com|prehends both our probationary and final &s;tate, under the righteous admini&s;tration of God.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the &s;ubject is very general, and of the la&s;t importance to all; yet civil power being one of the principal of tho&s;e talents which Heaven commits to men, and the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion requiring a more particu|lar con&s;ideration of it, the en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e will be con|fined thereto. Nor would I injure our honoured Rulers by the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion, that they can po&s;&s;ibly take it ami&s;s to be reminded of their duty to God and Man upon this occa&s;ion, with all the plainne&s;s and &s;implicity becoming a mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, and con&s;i&s;tent with decency; the rules of which, it is hoped, will not be violated.</P>
<P>INDEED were One to di&s;cour&s;e upon this &s;ubject be|fore Rulers in an arbitary government; or before un|faithful Rulers, even where the con&s;titution is free; there would be almo&s;t a nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;gui&s;ing and &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing the truth, on one hand, or of giving umbrage on the other. A mi&s;erable dilemma! But &s;urely there
<PB N="3" REF="007256_0006_102B4668D0A39520">
can be no nece&s;&s;ity of the former, nor any danger of the latter, under &s;uch a government as the Briti&s;h, and before &s;uch Rulers as I have the honour to &s;peak to.</P>
<P>IT is cu&s;tomary for tho&s;e who are called to &s;peak upon &s;uch public occa&s;ions, to apologize for their want of pro|per qualifications for the ta&s;k. But how much rea&s;on &s;oever they may often have for this, I think it is u&s;ually their unhappine&s;s not to be tho't very &s;incere in doing it. I &s;hall therefore wholly omit this common ceremony; becau&s;e I would fain be thought quite in earne&s;t in every thing I &s;ay before &s;o grave and venerable an auditory, and upon &s;o important an occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT may not be improper, in the fir&s;t place, to &s;peak of the &s;ource and origin of civil power: And then, of the great end of government: Which two particulars will be di&s;patched in a few words. In the third place, it will be u&s;eful to recollect &s;ome of tho&s;e argu|ments, by which tho&s;e who are ve&s;ted with authority, &s;hould be induced to exerci&s;e it with fidelity, &s;uitable to the de&s;ign of it. And &s;o the &s;ubject will be clo&s;ed with &s;ome reflections, chiefly relative to this Anniver&s;ary, and to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Province.</P>
<P>As to the &s;ource and origin of civil power; the para|ble on which my di&s;cour&s;e is grounded, &s;ugge&s;ts that it is ultimately derived from God, who&s;e "kingdom rul|eth over all;" this being as truly a talent committed
<PB N="4" REF="007256_0007_102B466B34165DA8">
by Him to the fidelity of men, as any thing el&s;e can be. In this light it is con&s;idered in the holy &s;criptures. It is not only agreable to the original &s;cheme and plan of God's univer&s;al government, that civil rule &s;hould take place among men, in &s;ubordination to His own; but his providence is actually concerned in rai&s;ing tho&s;e per&s;ons to power and dominion, who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it. In the language of the Prophet, <Q>Wi&s;dom and might are His. He removeth kings, and &s;etteth up kings. The mo&s;t High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whom&s;oever he will.</Q> The language of the apo&s;tles is not le&s;s emphatical. They tell us that <Q>there is no power, but of God; that the powers that be, are ordained of God; and that they are God's Mini&s;ters.</Q></P>
<P>BUT then it is to be remembred, that this power is derived from God, not immediately, but mediately, as other talents and ble&s;&s;ings are. The notions of any par|ticular form of government explicitly in&s;tituted by God, as de&s;igned for a univer&s;al model; of the divine right of monarchy, in contradi&s;tinction from all other modes; of the hereditary, unalienable right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; of the de&s;potic, unlimited power of kings, by the immediate grant of Heaven; and the like; the&s;e notions are not drawn from the holy &s;criptures, but from a far le&s;s pure and &s;acred fountain. They are only the divices of lawned para&s;ites, or other gracele&s;s politicians, to &s;erve
<PB N="5" REF="007256_0008_102B466D84585DA0">
the purpo&s;es of ambition and tyranny. And tho' they are of late date, yet being traced up to their true original, they will be found to come, by uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, from him who was a politician from the beginning.</P>
<P>GOD did indeed formerly take one nation under his more immediate care and patronage, e&s;tabli&s;hing therein a kind of civil polity. But with this, the other nations of the world had no concern; nor were they required to imitate it. It might be added, that even this common-wealth of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was not moulded and modeled wholly by the immediate dictates of Heaven. <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who &s;ome|times con&s;ulted God in the Mount, at other times con|&s;ulted his father-in-law <HI>Jethro</HI> in <HI>Midian,</HI> the prince and prie&s;t of that country. By who&s;e advice, tho' a mere pagan, it was that the great <HI>Hebrew</HI> lawgiver, partly framed his government. And it is to be ob&s;erved, that this government did not put on the regal form at all, till after a long time; and then, in expre&s;s contradiction to the coun&s;el of the Prophet, God declaring that this people rejected Him, in reque&s;ting a king. To &s;ay the lea&s;t, monarchical government has no better foundation in the oracles of God, than any other. And after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of it among&s;t the Hebrews, the crown, in&s;tead of de&s;cending uniformly to the elder branch of the male line, was often be&s;towed on a younger; &s;ome|times transferred to another family; and &s;ometimes even into another tribe: And this not without the divine approbation.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007256_0009_102B4670478B1760">
ALL the different con&s;titutions of government now in the world, are immediately the creatures of man's mak|ing, not of God's. And indeed the ve&s;tiges of human imperfection are &s;o manife&s;t in them, that it would be a reproach to the all-wi&s;e God to attribute them directly to Him. And as they are the creatures of man's mak|ing; &s;o from man, from common con&s;ent, it is that lawful rulers immediately receive their power. This is the channel in which it flows from God, the original &s;ource of it. Nor are any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a greater por|tion of it, than what is conveyed to them in this Way. Or at lea&s;t, if they have any more, they have it only as the thief or the robber has the &s;poil, which fraud or vio|lence has put into his hands. Agreably to what is here &s;aid, concerning the medium or channel thro' which power is derived from God, government is &s;poken of in &s;cripture, as being both the ordinance of God, and the ordinance of man: Of God, in reference to His original plan, and univer&s;al Providence; and of man, as it is more immediately the re&s;ult of human prudence, wi&s;|dom and concert.</P>
<P>IN the SECOND place, we are ju&s;t to mention the great end of government. And after the glory of God, which we u&s;ually con&s;ider as the end of all things in general, that can be no other than the good of man, the com|mon benefit of &s;ociety. This is equally evident whether we con&s;ider it as a divine, or an human in&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="007256_0010_102B4671D87E0118">
As it is God's ordinance, it is de&s;igned for a ble&s;&s;ing to the world. It is in&s;tituted for the pre&s;ervation of mens per&s;ons, properties &amp; various rights, again&s;t fraud and lawle&s;s violence; and that, by means of it, we may both procure, and quietly enjoy, tho&s;e numerous ble&s;&s;ings and advantages, which are unattainable out of &s;ociety, and being unconnected by the bonds of it. It is not conceiveable that the all-wi&s;e and good God, &s;hould or|dain government among&s;t men, but with a view to its being &s;ub&s;ervient to their happine&s;s, and well-being in the world: to be &s;ure, not, that it might be &s;ub&s;ervient to a contrary one, their mi&s;ery. We cannot imagine it po&s;&s;ible that He who is good unto all, and who&s;e tender mercies are over all his works, &s;hould exalt a few per&s;ons to power over the re&s;t, to be their oppre&s;&s;ors; or merely for their own &s;akes, that they may ama&s;s riches, that they may live in ea&s;e and &s;plendor, that they may riot on the produce of other's toil, and receive the homage of mil|lions, without doing them any good. It were bla&s;phe|mous to think that God has in&s;tituted government for &s;uch a partial, unworthy end.</P>
<P>So far as God interpo&s;ed in founding the common-wealth of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> it was in favour to his cho&s;en people that he did it: not that they might be oppre&s;&s;ed and en&s;laved by their own Rulers; but that they might be delivered from oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;lavery and their ta&s;kma&s;ters in <HI>Egypt:</HI> And that, being brought out of the hou&s;e of Bon|dage,
<PB N="8" REF="007256_0011_102B4674AE086C80">
they might be conducted into a good land, flowing with milk &amp; honey; that they might there po&s;&s;e&s;s pro|perty, enjoy the ble&s;&s;ing of equal laws, and be happy. Nor is the general de&s;ign of government and magi&s;tracy now, throughout the world, different from what it was among the I&s;raelites; viz. the happine&s;s of men. Ac|cordingly the apo&s;tle tells us that the civil magi&s;trate "is the mini&s;ter of God to us for good," and from hence argues the rea&s;onablene&s;s of &s;ubmitting to his au|thority. And all the in&s;tructions &amp; admonitions which God has given to rulers in his word, exactly corre&s;pond to this declared end of their in&s;titution. The end of government then, as it is a divine ordinance, mu&s;t be human felicity.</P>
<P>AND if we con&s;ider it as it is more immediately the ordinance of man, the end mu&s;t evidently be the &s;ame. It being founded in, and &s;upported by, common con&s;ent, it is impo&s;&s;ible the de&s;ign of it &s;hould be any other: &s;ince we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that men would voluntarily enter into &s;ociety, and &s;et up and maintain a common autho|rity, upon any other principles than tho&s;e of mutual &s;e|curity and common good. Nor is there any medium betwixt &s;uch common con&s;ent as is here intended, and plain lawle&s;s force and violence; for which Chri&s;tians, &s;urely, ought not to be advocates. Some &s;tates may have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their beginning, and more, their progre&s;s and en|gagement, to the latter of the&s;e cau&s;es. But the&s;e are
<PB N="9" REF="007256_0012_102B467686347C58">
not to be drawn into example, or to have any regard paid to them, when we are &s;peaking of the end of go|vernment. We ought not to take our e&s;timate of the de&s;ign hereof, from the views of banditti, and robbers, a&s;&s;ociated to plunder and oppre&s;s others: (tho' even they have a common intere&s;t which they profe&s;s to regard, and which keeps them together.) But we are to form our idea of this end, by what rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ts mu&s;t be the motive with rea&s;onable and hone&s;t men to unite to|gether in the bonds of &s;ociety. And if we judge by this rule, the end of government mu&s;t be the common good of all, and of every individual, &s;o far as is con&s;i&s;tent therewith.</P>
<P>We are therefore brought exactly to the &s;ame point at la&s;t, whether we con&s;ider government as it is originally an appointment of Heaven, or, more immediately, the voluntary choice of men. The &s;ecurity and happine&s;s of all the members compo&s;ing the political body, mu&s;t be the de&s;ign and end thereof, con&s;idered in both the&s;e lights. God is too good to ordain it for any other Pur|po&s;es; and men, at lea&s;t love them&s;elves too well, to chu&s;e it from any other principles: Unle&s;s, perhaps we may &s;uppo&s;e that a farther de&s;ign of political union, is the defence and patronage of other per&s;ons, out of the &s;ociety; and the doing of good to all, as opportunity is, in providence, afforded for it. But if this is really any end at all; yet it being only a &s;econdary and remote one, it might have been pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="007256_0013_102B46781212D8A8">
BUT tho' the grand end of government under all its different forms, is one, the good of the political body; this general end admits of various &s;ubdivi&s;ions, and is pro&s;ecuted in a variety of ways; to &s;peak of which is quite beyond the de&s;ign of this di&s;cour&s;e: and indeed that would be to deliver a &s;y&s;tem of politicks, rather than a &s;ermon. I &s;hall therefore only add under this head, that as the happine&s;s of men in &s;ociety depends greatly upon the goodne&s;s of their morals, and as morals have a clo&s;e connection with religion, the latter as well as the former, ought doubtle&s;s to be encouraged by the civil magi&s;trate; not only by his own pious life &amp; good example; but al&s;o by his laws, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with the natural, unalie|nable rights of every man's con&s;cience. Protection is, in ju&s;tice, due to all per&s;ons indifferently, who&s;e religion does not manife&s;tly, and very directly, tend to the &s;ub|ver&s;ion of the government. And a general toleration, with this &s;ingle exception, is &s;o far from being pernicious to &s;ociety, that it greatly promotes the good of it in many re&s;pects. Per&s;ecution and intolerance, are not only un ju&s;t, and criminal in the &s;ight of God; but they al&s;o cramp, enfeeble, and dimini&s;h the &s;tate. And many &s;tates, in other re&s;pects politic enough, have hereby greatly prejudiced them&s;elves, and &s;trengthened their ri|val neighbours. For what el&s;e is it, to butcher multi|tudes of their own people on religious accounts, as they have done; and to oblige others of them to betake them|&s;elves to flight, with their effects and arts, into foreign
<PB N="11" REF="007256_0014_102B467B07142240">
countries, where they may live &s;ecurely? So that &s;etting a&s;ide the great impiety and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of this prac|tice, the impolicy of it is a &s;ufficient argument again&s;t it. Nor, indeed, can it be doubted but that the intere&s;t of true religion, has been greatly prejudiced, by that notion which has &s;o generally prev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">d in Chri&s;tendom from the days of Con&s;tantine; I mean, that kings could not be <HI>nur&s;ing fathers,</HI> nor queens <HI>nur&s;ing mothers,</HI> to the Church, unle&s;s they &s;uckled her with human blood, and fed her with the fle&s;h of tho&s;e, whom angry Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks are plea&s;ed to &s;tigmatize with the names of heretic, &s;chi&s;|matic and infidel.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>Not only Germany, but all the Chri&s;tian &s;tates, bled at the wounds which they&mdash;received in&mdash;religious wars; a rage which is peculiar to Chri&s;tians, who are ignorant of idolatry, and is the unhappy con&s;equence of that dogmatical &s;pirit, which has &s;o long been introduced into all parties. There are few points of controver&s;y which have not been the occa&s;ion of a civil war: and foreign nations (perhaps our own po&s;terity) will one day be unable to comprehend how it was po&s;&s;ible, that our fore-fathers could kill one another, for &s;o many years together, and yet, at the &s;ame time, be preaching patience.</Q> Vol. Age of L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">XIV.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIRDLY: It is now time to mention &s;ome of tho&s;e arguments by which Rulers &s;hould be induced to exer|ci&s;e their power with fidelity, &s;uitable to the great end and de&s;ign of it. It is a&s;&s;erted by a great man of the la&s;t age, <Q>that the pretended depth and difficulty in matters of &s;tate, is a mere cheat. And from the beginning of the world, &s;ays he, to this day, you never found a common-wealth, where the leaders, hav|ing
<PB N="12" REF="007256_0015_102B467CF6D0B700">
hone&s;ty enough, wanted &s;kill enough to lead her to her true intere&s;t both at home and abroad.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Harrington&punc;</HI></NOTE> It belongs not to my function to determine how far this a&s;&s;ertion will hold true. But I may venture to &s;ay, that if hone&s;ty &amp; publick &s;pirit are all that are wanting, there are not wanting arguments enough, &s;ounded in rea&s;on and religion, to engage Rulers to act from tho&s;e principles.</P>
<P>To a generous mind, the public good, as it is the end of government, &s;o it is al&s;o &s;uch a noble and excellent one, that the pro&s;pect of attaining it will animate the pur&s;uit, and being attained, it will reward the pains. The very name of patrioti&s;m is indeed become a je&s;t with &s;ome men; which would be much &s;tranger than it is, had not &s;o many others made a je&s;t of the thing, &s;erving their own ba&s;e and wicked ends, under the pretext and colour of it. But there will be hypocrites in politicks, as well as in religion. Nor ought &s;o &s;acred a name to fall into contempt, however it may have been pro&s;tituted &amp; pro|faned, to varni&s;h over crimes. And tho&s;e times are <HI>pe|rilous</HI> indeed, wherein <HI>men &s;hall be</HI> only <HI>lovers of their own &s;elves,</HI> having no concern for the good of the public. Shall we go to the pagans to learn this god-like virtue? Even they can teach it. And is there a Chri&s;tian, who is required to love all men, and to do good to all, as he may have opportunity for it; is there a Chri&s;tian, who does not love even his brethren, the members of the &s;ame body
<PB N="13" REF="007256_0016_102B467E83A9D208">
with him&s;elf? Is there a Chri&s;tian, who is void of all generous &s;olicitude for his country's welfare? Is there, who has no de&s;ire to &s;ee it in a pro&s;perous and flouri&s;hing condition? Who has no plea&s;ure in actually &s;eeing it &s;o? Is there, who has no grief, in beholding its calamities? no di&s;po&s;ition to &s;erve it? Such a per&s;on, tho' he were of a private character, would be a reproach not only to his religion, a religion of charity and beneficence, but even to our common nature, as corrupt and depraved as it is. But how much more infamous were this, in per|&s;ons of a public character? in tho&s;e, on whom the wel|fare of their country, under providence, immediately depends?</P>
<P>BUT it is not to be thought merely an office of gene|ro&s;ity and charity, for Rulers to exert them&s;elves in the &s;ervice of the public. This is an indi&s;pen&s;able duty of ju&s;tice which they owe to it, by virtue of their &s;tation. They have taken the care and guardian&s;hip thereof upon them&s;elves: yea they are commonly laid under the &s;o|lemn obligation of an oath, to &s;tudy and pur&s;ue its in|tere&s;t. And why are they honoured? why, rewarded by the public, but that the public may receive benefit from them?

ANOTHER argument of &s;ome weight, is, that people are not u&s;ually either &s;o blind and in&s;en&s;ible as not to know when they are well governed; or &s;o ungrateful as not to acknowledge it, and to requite their benefactors &s;uitably to their merits. Some men will, indeed be cap|tious, and find fault without rea&s;on: But it is a mere calumny to repre&s;ent them of this turn and temper in general. All hi&s;tory &s;carce affords an example of a peo|ple ruled with prudence, ju&s;tice, and due clemency, but what lov'd and honour'd their Rulers; but what loudly proclaimed their vertues; but what, in all proper ways, requited their paternal care and goodne&s;s, while living, and reverenced their memory, when dead. And how much more de&s;ireable is this, than for them to have their ears filled with cries, complaints and murmurings? How much more eligible is it, to live e&s;teemed, and to have their names tran&s;mitted with honour to po&s;terity, than to be the objects of public hatred, as being rather ta&s;k-ma&s;ters than fathers; and to leave no remembrance be|hind them, but of their &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and inju&s;tice; their unfaithfulne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ions?</P>
<P>IT were, moreover, to be wi&s;hed, that Rulers (e&s;pecially Legi&s;lators, whom I have all along chiefly in view) would &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider how much their own beloved po&s;terity may be affected by their coun&s;els and conduct. The effect of public coun&s;els and re&s;olutions, whether good or bad, is not &s;o tran&s;ient as they are them&s;elves. Even re|mote

generations often feel the con&s;equence of them. By wi&s;e and good laws, and a proper conduct in other re|&s;pects, the governors of a people, lay a foundation, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, not only for the welfare of the generation pre&s;ent, but al&s;o for the pro&s;perity of tho&s;e who may come after them. In doing which, they, in effect, leave the mo&s;t valuable legacy to their own offspring; where|as, by a contrary conduct, they entail on them only mi|&s;ery and ruin. This con&s;ideration will be of great weight, not only with per&s;ons of a truly patriot and public &s;pirit; but even with all &s;uch as are not <HI>without natural affection;</HI> with all, who would not have their memory cur&s;ed after they are gone, even by tho&s;e who &s;hould <HI>ri&s;e up, and call them ble&s;&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>A FARTHER argument may be drawn from this con|&s;ideration, that Rulers derive their power from God, and are ordained to be his <HI>mini&s;ters for good.</HI> They are not only entru&s;ted by man with the care of the public; but by God him&s;elf, the &s;upreme lawgiver, that they may be the in&s;truments of his goodne&s;s and munificence. This doctrine, that rulers are God's mini&s;ters, and cloathed with authority delegated from Him, has far too often been made u&s;e of as a topic of compliment and adulation, in order to &s;ooth them, and puff them up with vain ima|ginations. And &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful have the &s;ervile adorers of Princes &s;ometimes been, in the management of it, as to make them conceit them&s;elves almo&s;t literally Gods, and
<PB N="16" REF="007256_0019_102B468511D9F240">
to think their &s;ubjects &s;carce better than brutes, made only for their &s;ervice. That the title intended, denotes their dignity, and the honour which they may ju&s;tly ex|pect, no one can que&s;tion. But the grand inference they them&s;elves ought to draw from hence, is, that they &s;hould imitate the ju&s;tice and unwearied goodne&s;s of that God, who&s;e mini&s;ters they are; and exerci&s;e the power with which His providence has cloathed them, to that graci|ous end, for which it is given. When they pro&s;ecute the true intere&s;ts of the public, and diffu&s;e happine&s;s a|round them, then, and only then, they act up to their honourable character. They then an&s;wer the noble pur|po&s;es for which Heaven exalted them; and are &s;econd|ing the benevolent de&s;igns of providence, being <HI>workers together with God.</HI> And what can more animate a con|&s;iderate man to fidelity in his tru&s;t, than this reflection, That while he is thus &s;erving his generation, he is doing it <HI>according to the will of God?</HI> that he therein concurs with the de&s;igns of the greate&s;t and be&s;t of Beings, the Creator and Lord of all, who is good unto all? It is an hone&s;t joy, a plea&s;ure truly divine, that mu&s;t re&s;ult from &s;uch con&s;cious integrity.</P>
<P>CHRISTIAN Rulers &s;hould, moreover, always have in view the example of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Redeemer, to whom <HI>all power in Heaven and in earth is given.</HI> All his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ws are calculated for the good of his &s;ubjects; and he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them, in order to render them happy.

<P>BUT the argument &s;ugge&s;ted in my text, is of the greate&s;t weight and &s;olemnity of any that can be tho't of; viz. the account which all men are to give of their conduct hereafter, to the judge of quick and dead. That &s;ame Lord, who has given to one of his &s;ervants five talents, to another two, and to another one, will come at the appointed time to reckon with them; and to render to every man according to his deeds. Nor are there any per&s;ons who have more rea&s;on to aim at approving them|&s;elves to Him, than civil Rulers, who have &s;o great a charge. It is an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim of God's equal go|vernment, that <Q>unto whom&s;oever much is given, of him &s;hall much be required.</Q> Nor does He, at who&s;e tribunal they are to appear, regard the per&s;ons of princes any more than of their &s;laves. They are all equally His &s;ervants. Happy! thrice happy! tho&s;e who &s;hall then be found faithful; for then &s;hall they <HI>enter into the joy of their Lord.</HI> Not &s;o, the &s;lothful and wicked &s;ervant, who has either neglected, or wilfully mi&s;applied, the talents committed to him! Innumerable, alas! innu|merable are the mi&s;eries and calamities which have ac|crued, and are daily accruing, to mankind, from the abu&s;e of that very power, which was de&s;igned to prevent

them, and to be in&s;trumental of good to all that are un|der it. Heaven beholds the&s;e things: And &s;hall not Heaven, at length, vi&s;it for them! "Shall not the judge of all the earth do right!"</P>
<P>RULERS &s;urely, even the mo&s;t dignified and powerful of them, &s;hould not be &s;o elevated with the thoughts of their power, as to forget from whom it comes; for what purpo&s;es it is delegated to them; who&s;e impartial eye it is that &s;urveys all their coun&s;els, de&s;igns and actions; and who it is that will, one day, exact an account of their &s;teward&s;hip.

AND we are reminded by the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e, how great a ble&s;&s;ing good government is; and what gratitude becomes tho&s;e whom God, in his providence, favours with it. Incon&s;iderate men are too apt to think government rather a burden, than a ble&s;&s;ing; rather, as what &s;ome per&s;ons have invented for their own particular advantage, than what God has in&s;tituted for the good of all. This is, under Him, the great guard and &s;ecurity of mens property, peace, religion, lives; of every thing here, for which it is worth while to live. And this is a ble&s;&s;ing which Briti&s;h &s;ubjects enjoy, in as high a degree, perhaps, as any other people. It is their felicity to be governed by &s;uch men, and by &s;uch laws, as them&s;elves approve; without which their boa&s;ted liberty wou'd, indeed, be but an empty name. The form of our go|vernment is ju&s;tly the envy of mo&s;t other nations; e&s;pe|cially of tho&s;e which have either no parliaments at all, or &s;uch as may be bani&s;hed at the word and plea&s;ure of a tyrant; which comes much to the &s;ame thing. We have al&s;o, for &s;everal late reigns, been ble&s;&s;ed with Princes too ju&s;t &amp; good to encroach upon the rights of their &s;ubjects, and too wi&s;e to think that Britons can endure a chain.

PERSONS of a private character are, moreover, admo|ni&s;hed of the reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which they owe to government as it is God's ordinance; and as Rulers derive their power from him. Were this no more than an human in&s;titution, yet it would, in the nature of the thing, demand great re&s;pect; that being nece&s;&s;ary even to the pre&s;ervation of it in the world, and &s;o, to peoples reaping tho&s;e numerous advantages which accrue from it. But when we reflect, that this is an appointment of Heaven, it &s;ugge&s;ts that we &s;hould be &s;ubject even "for con&s;cience &s;ake;" and that we cannot behave undutifully towards our Rulers, without al&s;o rebelling again&s;t God. Nor is it ea&s;y to mention any duty which the go&s;pel in|culcates upon the con&s;ciences of men, with greater &s;o|lemnity, than that of paying due honour to Kings, and all that are in authority. However, it is not be forgotten, that as in all free con&s;titutions of government, law, and not will, is the mea&s;ure of the executive Magi&s;trate's power; &s;o it is the mea&s;ure of the &s;ubject's obedience and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion.

<P>IT is moreover &s;ugge&s;ted by what has been &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, how much care and integrity &s;hould be exer|cis'd in the choice of tho&s;e, who are to have a &s;hare in government; that they may not be unworthy of it. If it ever happens in countries of liberty, that the conduct of public affairs falls into the hands of weak or di&s;hone&s;t men, the people will &s;carce be the le&s;s mi&s;erable, becau&s;e they had the choice of the&s;e men them&s;elves; tho' they will be the le&s;s to be pitied. People have, in &s;ome countries, been &s;o regardle&s;s of their own welfare, as to give too much encouragement to de&s;igning men, who would prac|ti&s;e upon them; yea, as to make an infamous merchan|dize of their hands and voices to the highe&s;t bidder, without any con&s;ideration of merit, of capacity or incli|nation to &s;erve the public. It is not ea&s;y to determine, who are the mo&s;t criminal, they who would make their way to places of power and tru&s;t, by indirect means, or they who have &s;o little concern for the welfare of their country, as to hearken to them, and to become the tools of their ambition and covetou&s;ne&s;s. And how faithfully they are likely to &s;erve their country, who &s;et out with corrupting it; they who a&s;pire to a part in the govern|ment, by bribing the avaricious, by flattering the fooli&s;h, and making fine promi&s;es to the credulous; is not hard to conjecture.</P>

<P>THE want of &s;ome act effectually to &s;ettle claims and quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, e&s;pecially in the frontiers of the Pro|vince, is much complained of by many: not merely, as what renders private property too precarious; but al&s;o as what is prejudicial to the publick, in more re&s;pects than one.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;uch a &s;pirit in &s;ome re&s;pects, now appear|ing, and growing, among&s;t us, as being duly encouraged by the legi&s;lature, cannot, with the ordinary ble&s;&s;ing of providence, but be of happy con&s;equence. We are grown pretty &s;en&s;ible of the importance of improving our lands, better than formerly; that &s;o we may not be beholden for our daily bread, unle&s;s it is to Him, to whom we pray for it. It is not improbable, from the late experiments of &s;ome public &s;pirited Gentlemen, that we might have a valuable &s;taple, by means of that fruit which delights &s;o much in our &s;oil; as well as greatly le&s;&s;en the importation of foreign liquors. Something con&s;iderable has, of late, been done towards the e&s;tabli&s;h|ing of u&s;eful manufactures among us: none of which, it is to be hoped, will fall thro' and mi&s;carry, for want

of proper encouragement from the government. The fi&s;hery now of late projected, and carried on, from this Capital, cannot fail to be of great Advantage to it, in the low and declining &s;tate of its commerce; and, indeed, to the whole province; at lea&s;t as long as the mortifying religion of lent, is upheld in foreign countries.&mdash;</P>
<P>To the&s;e Things, which have a favourable a&s;pect, may be added the zeal &s;hown by many for the introduction of foreign Prote&s;tants. It is large importations of this &s;ort, not of other European commodities, that has made one of our Briti&s;h provinces rich and populous, in the cour&s;e of a few years; &s;o that, of an incon&s;iderable &s;et|tlement, it now vies with the greate&s;t and mo&s;t opulent. And that which may, perhaps, render it the more expe|dient thus to increa&s;e our numbers, is the probability that we &s;hall, before long, have other employment than agri|culture, and the ble&s;&s;ed arts of peace, for many of our own people: I mean, in curbing and cha&s;tizing the in|&s;olence of our neighbours on the Continent; neighbours, who&s;e perfidy renders them a more formidable enemy even in peace, than either their number or bravery in war.</P>
<P>IT is not a little &s;urprizing to many per&s;ons abroad, that this government has been at no greater expence, and taken no more pains, to civilize the natives of the country; and to propagate among&s;t them the glorious

Go&s;pel of our Redeemer: E&s;pecially con&s;idering one profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of our fore-fathers in coming hither, our own high preten&s;ions to religion, and our own intere&s;t. Indeed there is &s;ome rea&s;on to fear, that even the dona|tions of per&s;ons abroad, and entru&s;ted with others here, in America, for carrying on &s;o pious and good a de&s;ign, have not always been applied with that care, impar|tiality and faithfulne&s;s, which might have been ju&s;tly expected But this not being a matter wherein the go|vernment is immediately concerned, I &s;hall &s;ay no more of it: and &s;ome will, perhaps, think that even this is too much.</P>
<P>IT is to be hoped that You, our honoured Rulers, will not neglect any means that are proper to be u&s;ed by the government, to humanize and chri&s;tianize the&s;e poor Salvages. Charity requires this, and requires it the more, becau&s;e they will, otherwi&s;e, be in great danger of apo&s;tatizing from their natural pagani&s;m and barbari|ty, into that which is wor&s;e, the religion of Rome; a religion, calculated rather to make men wicked, than to keep them from being &s;o, or to reform them after they are become &s;o. We know the great pains, and various artifices, that are u&s;ed by the Romi&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries, to con|vert them to this wicked religion. Nor can One well help calling to mind here, the words of our ble&s;&s;ed Savi|our: <Q>Woe unto you;&mdash;for ye compa&s;s &s;ea and land to make one pro&s;elyte; and when he is made, ye make him two-fold more the child of hell,</Q> &amp;c.</P>

BUT, as was intimated before, were compa&s;&s;ion to the &s;ouls of the&s;e mi&s;erable pagans wholly out of the ca&s;e, even policy requires us to bring them, if po&s;&s;ible, to embrace the prote&s;tant faith. This would be one great means, among&s;t others not &s;o proper to be mentioned in this place, of attaching them to the Briti&s;h intere&s;t: Whereas they will, otherwi&s;e, probably be our enemies. And what &s;ort of enemies we are to expect in them, is no hard matter to conjecture, &s;ince the great duties which the mi&s;&s;ionaries of Rome inculcate upon their &s;avage converts, are tho&s;e of butchering and &s;calping Prote&s;tans: Generous enemies, doubtle&s;s, when their native ferocity is whetted and improved by a religion, that naturally delights in blood and murder!</P>
<P>THAT which &s;eems, at pre&s;ent, chiefly to engage the attention of the public, is the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements on the Continent being now, in a manner, encompa&s;&s;ed by the French. And this is a matter of much more &s;erious importance than it would be, were it not for the nume|rous tribes of warlike natives on our back; who, it is to be feared, are more generally di&s;po&s;ed to fall in with that intere&s;t, than with ours. The principal rea&s;on of which is, doubtle&s;s, this; That our politic neighbours take much more pains to gain them over, than our colonies have hitherto done.

<P>As You, honoured Gentlemen, are delegated imme|diately by the good people of the Province, to repre&s;ent, and act for, them; You are, if po&s;&s;ible, under a nearer and &s;tricter obligation, to regard their welfare, than the other branches of the legi&s;lature. You are more particu|larly the guardians of their rights and privileges. It is, therefore, to be pre&s;umed, that you will always be zea|lous
<PB N="44" REF="007256_0047_102B46BE79027798">
to maintain them; and not only &s;o, but, in all things, &s;tudious of their real and be&s;t intere&s;t. Private, per&s;onal intere&s;t, You are very &s;en&s;ible, has nothing to do in the &s;upreme Court of the province. You are not deputed hereto by your con&s;tituents, Gentlemen, that you may pro&s;ecute your particular intere&s;ts, or the intere&s;ts of others, any farther than they coincide with the com|mon good, and are involved in it. Nor can you be at any lo&s;s, what ought to be done to the vile, mercenary tongue, that &s;hould toil; what, to the guilty hand, that <HI>right hand of fal&s;hood,</HI> which &s;hould either be lifted up, or kept down, to &s;erve the particular ends of any man or party whatever, to the detriment of the public! Such things are indeed, almo&s;t too infamous and horrid, to be &s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;ible, in a Chri&s;tian country. But alas! it is a degenerate world, if not a corrupt age of it, that we live in!&mdash;</P>
<P>HOWEVER, it were very injurious to &s;u&s;pect, honoured Gentlemen, but that You are all a&s;&s;embled here, from different parts of the land, with upright views, and an ardent love to your country. And if You mean to &s;erve the public, as doubtle&s;s you do, you will always <HI>&s;tudy the things that make for peace,</HI> both among&s;t your&s;elves, and with the other branches of the legi&s;lature: For it is by the&s;e things only, that the common-wealth is <HI>edified:</HI> not, &s;urely, by party di&s;putes and factions; not by in|dulged animo&s;ities, and &s;tudied oppo&s;itions; which
<PB N="45" REF="007256_0048_102B46C0ED36C4A0">
greatly di&s;honor and weaken any government; and have both their origin and end in evil. They who promote and foment them, have always &s;omething el&s;e in view than, what they would be tho't to have, the public good. This is, indeed, always the pretence; but private pique, or private intere&s;t, or a general temper and turn to wrangling, is at the bottom. It is, u&s;ually at lea&s;t, the pur&s;uit of &s;eperate, di&s;tinct intere&s;ts, and a want of pub|lic &s;pirit, that is the &s;ource of party and contentions in any &s;tate. When all are united heartily in the main end, having nothing &s;o much in view, as the good of the public; party names, di&s;tinctions, and di&s;putes, vani&s;h of cour&s;e; and that unanimity and harmony take place, which give both beauty and &s;trength to government; and without which, the public affairs cannot be carried on, to advantage. A public &s;pirit, is a &s;pirit of union; and union is the &s;ource of public happine&s;s: and public happine&s;s is the great end which you &s;hould have in view.</P>
<P>As you, honoured Gentlemen, have a di&s;tinct part in the legi&s;lature, nothing con&s;iderable can be done without You, for the public good; and I may add, or contrary to it: tho' I am far from thinking, that this is de&s;igned by any. God forbid! But the granting of monies, a thing of the utmo&s;t importance, lies more immediately with <HI>You.</HI> And tho' you will always have a tender con|cern
<PB N="46" REF="007256_0049_102B46C27880B4D8">
for the intere&s;t of your re&s;pective con&s;tituents, yet You will have a greater, for the good of the whole Pro|vince; to be &s;ure, for the common intere&s;t of his Ma|je&s;ty's dominions on this Continent. Nor will You be over thrifty, when <HI>that</HI> calls for liberality. And this will probably be the ca&s;e before it is long, if it is not actually &s;o already.</P>
<P>I &s;peak now with particular reference to the nece&s;&s;ary defence of this, and all the&s;e colonies, again&s;t tho&s;e who are making inroads upon us; and who have, even with|in the &s;pace of a few weeks, had the hardine&s;s to commit &s;uch ho&s;tilities as are not to be endured, unle&s;s we are determined to &s;it down in inglorious ea&s;e, and patiently to look on, while our trade with the natives is ra|vi&s;hed from us; our fortre&s;&s;es, taken; our friends and brethren, captivated, butchered, &s;calped; our fields, laid wa&s;te; our territories, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e that hate us; and the Briti&s;h intere&s;t on the Continent brought to no|thing. Peace is a great ble&s;&s;ing; peace is what we would chu&s;e; peace is the de&s;ire of all who de&s;erve the name of Chri&s;tians. But &s;hall the trumpet &s;leep? Shall the &s;word ru&s;t? Shall our gold and &s;ilver lye cankering in our coffers? Shall our military garments be moth-eaten for want of u&s;e, when &s;uch things are doing! It is impo&s;&s;ible, Gentlemen, you &s;hould be any ways back|ward, or par&s;imonious, in &s;uch a cau&s;e as this; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cau&s;e

wherein the glory of God, the honour of your King, and the good of your country, are &s;o deeply concerned; I might perhaps add, a cau&s;e, whereon the liberties of Eu|rope depend. For of &s;o great con&s;equence is the empire of North America, (and that, you are &s;en&s;ible, is the thing now aimed at by our neighbours) that it mu&s;t turn the &s;cale of power greatly in favour of the only Monarch, from whom tho&s;e liberties are in danger; and again&s;t that Prince, who is the grand &s;upport and bulwark of them. Con&s;ider then, Gentlemen, in the name of God, con&s;ider, what you owe Him, and to your holy religion; what, to the prote&s;tant intere&s;t in general; what, to your King and to Great-Britain, in particular; what, to your native country; what, to the honour of your Ance&s;tors; what, to the pre&s;ent generation; what, to future ones; what, to your&s;elves; and what, to tho&s;e whom the God of nature has made dearer to you than your&s;elves, your children. It is even uncertain, Gentlemen, how long you will have an <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> to &s;it in, unle&s;s a &s;peedy and vigorous oppo&s;ition is made to the pre&s;ent encroach|ments, and to the farther de&s;igns, of our enemies! This, &s;urely, is not a time to be &s;aving, unle&s;s in our private expences.</P>
<P>AND while I am &s;peaking of grants for the common good, I cannot but ju&s;t add, That neither the honour of the Province can be promoted, at pre&s;ent, nor its true

intere&s;t, in the end, by great par&s;imony towards tho&s;e who &s;erve the public in a public capacity; and receive &s;alaries from it. There is another thing which I would beg leave to hint at here. So far, honoured Gentlemen, as fixing the proportion which the different parts of the Community are re&s;pectively to bear in the public Ex|pences, lies with You, You will doubtle&s;s be far from de&s;iring, that any particular part, &s;hould bear a greater proportion than is ju&s;t and equal; being regulated by its ability and circum&s;tances relatively con&s;idered. You are too religious, ju&s;t and impartial to de&s;ire this.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>A certain part of this Community (which &s;urely there is no need of mentioning!) has fallen under &s;uch great decays and difficulties of late, thro' that &s;ame Providence, which has been &s;miling upon the other parts of the Province; that I verily believe righteous Heaven will be ju&s;tly and greatly provoked, unle&s;s &s;ome pity and relief is afforded to it.

IN fine, honoured Gentlemen, I per&s;wade my&s;elf, that you will, in all your debates and con&s;ultations, in all you do in your political, as well as private capacity, remem|ber you are to give an account of your&s;elves to the all-knowing, all-ju&s;t, and impartial Judge of the world. And if you keep this mo&s;t &s;olemn and awful truth up|permo&s;t in your minds, it will be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for you to do ami&s;s. You will then act, in all re&s;pects, with &s;uch a di&s;intere&s;ted view to the common good of your country; with &s;uch unblemi&s;hed, irreproachable integ|rity, as will be both acceptable to God your Saviour, and to tho&s;e for whom you act; with &s;uch prudence and fidelity, at lea&s;t, as will afford no handle to per&s;ons of captious tempers, and licentious tongues, under the pre|text of blaming <HI>former Hou&s;es,</HI> to couch a real and ju&s;t &s;arca&s;m on the <HI>pre&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>IF any thing has been &s;aid in this di&s;cour&s;e, not &s;uffi|ciently conformable to the u&s;ual &s;tyle of the pulpit; if, any thing that approaches too near to politicks; if the di&s;cour&s;e has not been enough confined to matters alto|gether &s;piritual; if our temporal and worldly concern|ments have been too long dwelt upon; in fine, if there has been any greater liberty of &s;peech u&s;ed; if, any greater pathos of expre&s;&s;ion, than becomes an Engli&s;h &s;ubject, a lover of his country, and a prote&s;tant Mini&s;ter, upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, and at &s;uch a juncture, as the pre&s;ent;

if this is the ca&s;e, as perhaps it is, the great candor of the audience is humbly relied on, to make the <HI>mo&s;t fa|vourable apology,</HI> that the nature of the thing will admit of, for him that has thus tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed. And <HI>that</HI> will be, at lea&s;t, as good a one, as any he could make for him&s;elf, &s;hould he attempt one. But an apology would certainly be nece&s;&s;ary in <HI>another</HI> re&s;pect, were this di&s;|cour&s;e protracted to a much greater length. My Re|verend fathers and brethren in the mini&s;try, will there|fore readily excu&s;e me, if I do not honour my&s;elf by a particular addre&s;s to them, as is cu&s;tomary upon the&s;e occa&s;ions: Tho' the &s;ubject I have been upon, is very applicable, not only to civil Rulers; but al&s;o to tho&s;e whom our ble&s;&s;ed Lord has <HI>counted faithful, putting them into the mini&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, I cannot conclude without ju&s;t reminding this great a&s;&s;embly, That all men have certain talents committed to them, for which they are accountable to him that gave them. The lea&s;t and lowe&s;t of us need not live without honouring God, in &s;ome way or other, and being, in a degree, &s;erviceable to the world. Nor &s;hall any one that is faithful to his tru&s;t, lo&s;e his reward; tho' he is &s;o far from being in a capacity to do great and exten&s;ive good in his generation, that he can only <Q>give a cup of cold water to a di&s;ciple in the name of a di&s;ciple. For if there be fir&s;t a willing mind, it is
<PB N="51" REF="007256_0054_102B46CC90542148">
accepted according to that a man hath, and not ac|cording to that he hath not. As we have many members in one body, and all members have not the &s;ame office; &s;o we, being many, are one body in Chri&s;t, and members one of another. Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether mini&s;try, let us wait on our mini&s;tring; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation; he that giveth, let him do it in &s;implicity; he that ruleth, with dili|gence; And, in all of us, let love be without di&s;&s;i|mulation, while we abhor that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good.</Q> Thus, thro' faith, and patience in well doing, &s;hall we at length <Q>inherit the promi&s;es:</Q> for "he is faithful that has promi&s;ed."</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t unavoidably concern our&s;elves, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, about the things of this mortal life, &s;o long as it &s;hall plea&s;e the Father of &s;pirits to continue us in it. But our great intere&s;t lies in another region, far beyond the &s;phere and verge of mortality. And who&s;oever is faithful to the death, &s;hall receive a crown of life, that fadeth not. There is nothing here, Men, Brethren and Fathers! there is nothing here, that can claim our highe&s;t love and affections. "All that cometh is vanity." Riches take to them&s;elves wings; plea&s;ures pall; "favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain." <Q>All things are full of change,</Q> and in perpetual rotation. <Q>The fa&s;hion of the world pa&s;&s;eth away;</Q> and God alone
