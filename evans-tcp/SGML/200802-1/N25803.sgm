<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT, &amp;c.
TO THE MEDICAL SOCIETY OF CONNECTICUT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have been informed, that, in the beginning of Augu&s;t la&s;t, the yellow fever broke out in Phildelphia; that, according to authentic records, this malignant &s;courge devoured about thirteen hundred of its inhabitants; and that, ear|ly in the month of October, it had happily and ab|&s;olutely di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>You have known al&s;o what mea&s;ures were adopted by our executive, by the board of in&s;pec|tors of the health-office, and by the college of phy|&s;icians of this city, to check its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>No doubt you have likewi&s;e read &s;everal pub|lications on the cau&s;e of origin, and on the nature and treatment of that malady. You mu&s;t al&s;o have ob&s;erved, with much concern, that learned men, eminent profe&s;&s;ional characters of the faculty, were ab&s;olutely and &s;y&s;tematically divided both in their theoretical and practical opinions on the
<PB REF="034311_0010_0FFC3C5BCE037E70">&s;ubject; &s;o that, tho&s;e de&s;irable improvements which would check its progre&s;s, and ju&s;tify and e&s;tabli&s;h the be&s;t mode of treatment, were unhap|pily retarded. But, gentlemen, the public alarm will &s;oon &s;ub&s;ide; and it is my hope that all regu|lar phy&s;icians, without any party &s;pirit or ambi|tion to dictate to each other, will very &s;oon &s;ur|render to &s;triking facts, and &s;ubmit to fundamen|tal and beneficial rules.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, therefore, di&s;pen&s;e with any hi&s;torical de|tails, conceiving that they more properly belong to the province of a public recorder, or to an official authority. My only view is, to promote medical knowledge, on that intere&s;ting &s;ubject; and it ad|mits of nothing foreign to the obligation which is impo&s;ed upon every phy&s;ician, to afford, if he can, by the means of a candid inve&s;tigation, &s;ome im|provements to the healing art. To phy&s;icians and to natural philo&s;ophers, in fact, the public, with confidence, entru&s;t the ta&s;k of re&s;earching the laws and evils of nature, that they may thus be ena|bled to protect the lives and health of their fellow creatures. My opinions and ob&s;ervations, however, I &s;ubmit to your examination and judgement; not pretending to dictate to any one who may think him&s;elf better informed.</P>
<P>I &s;hall trace the de&s;ign of my &s;ubject in order to compri&s;e the different views under which it may be con&s;idered; in all of which I &s;hall con|fine
<PB N="3" REF="034311_0011_0FFC3C5A465D7C70">my&s;elf to well known facts, in&s;tead of ar|ranging new theories and &s;y&s;tems.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;tly,</HI> I &s;hall examine mo&s;t of the opinions en|tertained by writers on the yellow fever, and the arguments by which they have been &s;upported or refuted.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall give a phy&s;iological de&s;crip|tion of the yellow fever, as it appeared, at differ|ent periods, in Philadelphia, and enquire into the cau&s;es to which it may be a&s;cribed.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I will de&s;cribe our method of treatment for the cure of the yellow fever.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Practical cautions for the cure, will be enumerated.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> General means to prevent the intro|duction and generation of the yellow fever, will be propo&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>VARIOUS and numerous are the opinions on the origin and nature of the yellow fever. The fir&s;t is, that it was imported from the empire of Siam,
<PB N="4" REF="034311_0012_0FFC3C58B919C088">into the We&s;t-India i&s;lands by a French &s;quadron, returning from thence, in the year 1689; and which was obliged, by &s;tre&s;s of weather, to put into Fort Royal, in Martinico<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide De&s;cription de la partie Franc, de St. Domingue par Moreau de St. Mery, p. 700.</NOTE>. It is true, in|deed, that, as &s;oon as the&s;e &s;hips arrived, their crews, as well as the crews of many others, were much infected with a very malignant fever. Great number peri&s;hed, together with many inhabitants of the i&s;land. From Fort Royal the malady was imported, by &s;ome commi&s;&s;ioned &s;hips, into St. Chri&s;topher's and into Hi&s;paniola, where it made great havock. In Port-de-Paix, and &s;everal other places, its effects were &s;o dread|ful, during many years after, that, in the year 1692, a royal edict, from the king of France, ordered a quarantine for all &s;hips coming from Martinico. Two years after, and even &s;o late as 1708, penal laws, inflicting the puni&s;h|ment of death, were pa&s;&s;ed in commercial towns again&s;t any &s;eaman or pa&s;&s;enger who &s;hould come on &s;hore without a legal examination or permit. The malignancy of the di&s;order was &s;uch, &s;ays Mr. Morean de St. Mery, "as to cau&s;e corrup|ted blood to run out from all the organs, and even from the pores of the &s;kin, which was after|wards covered with bloody &s;pots." Since that fa|tal epocha, &s;everal accounts have been publi&s;h|ed of a particular kind of malignant fever raging,
<PB N="5" REF="034311_0013_0FFC3C5661005958">at certain periods and &s;ea&s;ons of the year, in all the tropical countries; which, in all its &s;ymptoms was nearly like the yellow fever. One of the olde&s;t and mo&s;t &s;atisfactory accounts which we have of the malady of Siam, or of the yellow fever, is that of Mr. Pouppe De&s;portes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Maladies de St. Domingue.</NOTE>, a French phy&s;ician, &s;ent to Hi&s;paniola, by the king of France, in the year 1732, to &s;uperintend the regulations and e&s;ta|bli&s;hments of the ho&s;pitals in the colony. It is true that &s;ome &s;ymptoms of the fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er de&s;cribed by that candid writer, &s;eem never to have occur|red in the American yellow fever; but they can|not con&s;titute a material difference. They only lead to prove, that the &s;ame di&s;ordered may take va|rious &s;hapes, and characters, according to circum|&s;tances of &s;oil and climate. Pouppe De&s;portes cal|led the fever an pe&s;tilential one, and had no doubt of its contagious nature. He enumerated more dreadful diagno&s;tics than any we know of. Be|&s;ides the black vomit, and the j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">ice, he ob|&s;erved that &s;uppurations and mortifications on the joints were often its forerunners. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e, as de&s;cribed by him, corre|&s;pond with what we have experienced here; and, from a comparative &s;tatement of the temperature and variation of the atmo&s;phere, during many years, he drew the decided opinion, that the ma|lady of Siam was always an immediate effect of
<PB N="6" REF="034311_0014_0FFC3C53605DC828">noxious exhalations, produced by the united agen|cy of &s;torms, rains, and great heats.</P>
<P>Another re&s;pectable witne&s;s of the &s;ame di&s;|ea&s;e, is Mr. Dazille, phy&s;ician appointed by the king in Hi&s;paniola, about twenty years ago<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Ob&s;ervations &s;ur les Maladies des Negres.</NOTE>. He reports that he was called in, at Cape Francois, with three other phy&s;icians, to con&s;ult on the ca&s;e of a Mr. Lambert, who had lately arrived from Europe, and thus expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf. "On the &s;e|venth day of his &s;ickne&s;s, Mr. Lambert was &s;tand|ing up in the middle of his room, not complain|ing of any kind of pain. He appeared much di&s;|plea&s;ed at our meeting for con&s;ultation, and af|firmed that the was not &s;ick. His pul&s;e was inter|mitting, and a little febrile; his conver&s;ation was &s;omewhat incoherent; and his eyes were tinged with a light yellow hue. I firmly declared to the phy&s;icians, that, in the evening, he would die. We met again at twelve o'clock; when we found him as yellow as a marigold and in a &s;tate of coma. His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">glutition was already difficult, and he died at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> half after &s;even in the evening!</P>
<P>"I was &s;ometime after, reque&s;ted, by the vi&s;|count de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hoi&s;eul, to vi&s;it Mr. de Sainthenay, knight of St. Louis, &amp;c. I found him &s;itting at his de&s;k counting money. Since the fourth day of his &s;ickne&s;s, he had been yellow and over his
<PB N="7" REF="034311_0015_0FFC3C50F90CD3F0">body. His countenance was anxious and much altered; his pul&s;e very bad; and his &s;kin had al|ready that cold moi&s;ture which &s;o peculiarly de|&s;ignates the la&s;t &s;tage of this kind of malignant fever. I immediately &s;ent word to the vi&s;count, that Mr. de S. would die on the &s;ame day, which was, unfortunately, the ca&s;e."</P>
<P>Experience had taught Mr. Dazille the in&s;idi|ous and deceiving appearances peculiarly remark|able in the malady of Siam, or yellow fever; and he cautions his medical readers not ha&s;tily to progno&s;ticate the fate of their patients. He and &s;everal other French writers have po&s;itively a&s;|&s;erted that this fever was introduced into the We&s;t-Indies from A&s;ia, about a century before. Although it has all the features of a contagion, to prove that opinion, yet it is very &s;trange that it never has been imported into Europe, notwith|&s;tanding the uninterupted intercour&s;e of all the European powers with their i&s;lands. Time and experience have proved to them, that the malig|nancy and frequency of fevers in the tropical countries could not reach Europe. However, it cannot be incon&s;i&s;tent to &s;uppo&s;e, that, if the malady of Siam had been imported from &s;o di&s;|tant a region as the Ea&s;t-Indies into tropical Ame|rica, it might, of cour&s;e, have been received in the &s;outh of Europe; &s;ince there is no great dif|ference between the climates of New-York or Newhaven, and tho&s;e of Cadiz or Mar&s;eilles.
<PB N="8" REF="034311_0016_0FFC3C4E9C73EB98">Indeed, if there is a difference, it &s;urely will he favourable to the hypothe&s;is, that &s;uch a fever could have been imported often into the &s;outhern latitudes of Europe. This was never the ca&s;e, I believe, however, but once; when, in the year 1757, an Engli&s;h man of war from Quebec arri|ved in Plymouth with the yellow fever, which was very &s;oon &s;ubdued by the climate, and did not leave the lea&s;t marks of contagion.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, that, by its nature, this fe|ver is confined to tropical countries, and &s;eldom or never can &s;pread in the northern latitudes, un|le&s;s it &s;hould there meet with an uncommon de|gree of heat, as is often the ca&s;e in North Ame|rica. Such objections may be refuted, by con&s;ider|ing, that the yellow fever does not preci&s;ely break out during the heat of our tropical days, but on the return of the variable days of autumn. Shall we not then &s;ay, that the yellow fever may ari&s;e from &s;ome &s;ource colder and nearer than Siam or other tropical countries?</P>

<P>It is an unque&s;tionable truth, that a contagious di&s;order may be imported; and that this frequently happens, can be proved by many hi&s;torical and re|cent facts. Again&s;t the&s;e we do not pretend to op|po&s;e any dogmatical a&s;&s;ertion. But, if the malignant &s;courge has always been introduced by extraneous cau&s;es, and could never exi&s;t in our climate but by importation, why does it reach our &s;hores, &s;o late as the month of Augu&s;t? Why is the plague of the American tropical i&s;lands increa&s;ed by the mild and moderate temperature of our autumn? If it be an&s;wered, that the contagion mu&s;t acquire its growth during the hot &s;ummer of the i&s;lands, before it can be tran&s;ported, they thus a&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> po&s;itive contradiction.

<P>An imported contagion might, indeed, be more heightened in certain places than in others; but as the contagion of the plague, the venereal lues, the itch, the &s;curvy, the &s;mall pox, &amp;c. are active in any part of the world, why does not this complaint &s;pread to our inland places, country &s;eats, and towns; among our robu&s;t farmers and the numerous inhabitants of our back countries? Are the&s;e places &s;o perfectly airy and refre&s;hed, that this kind of contagion cannot reach them? Should it be an&s;wered, that in maritime towns only the atmo&s;phere can receive and tran&s;mit the &s;eed of contagion, it is obviou&s;ly admitting that there is an unque&s;tionable ground to a&s;&s;ert, that the fever is generated among us.</P>
<P>Why is it that people, attached to a certain mode of life, and careful in the u&s;e of certain pre|ventives, may expo&s;e them&s;elves to the floating contagion, without fear as well as without effect? Are they more favoured by nature, di&s;po&s;ition, and con&s;titution? If it is &s;aid, that a perfect &s;tate of health does not admit this kind of contagion, is not, what we &s;uppo&s;e, admitted, that an imper|fect &s;tate of health will ea&s;ily be acted upon by an impure atmo&s;phere, or by exhalations from cor|rupted animal, or vegetable &s;ub&s;tances?</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="034311_0019_0FFC3C4783664CE0">Infine, there are authentic proofs that the yel|low fever has &s;ometimes, appeared in i&s;olated ca&s;es, in Philadelphia, and other towns. It did not &s;pread, however, except in the years 1762, 1793, and 1797. Doctor Hilary has al&s;o ob&s;erved, and po&s;itively a&s;certained, that once in Barbadoes the yellow fever was not communicated even to the attendants of the &s;ick. As this &s;trange circum&s;tance cannot be explained, except by the &s;tate of the air, is it not enough from his a&s;&s;ertion, and from the repeated in&s;tances in which it did not &s;pread, to derive the grounds of our opinion, that this fever is &s;ometimes generated by principles contained in our own atmo&s;phere? After all the&s;e arguments, gentlemen, again&s;t the importation of the yellow fever, from Siam or from the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, it would be unfair not to take notice of the arguments by which it has been deduced from a different ori|gin. The&s;e grounds or proofs are but few and equi|vocal, and mo&s;t of them will contribute to &s;upport our opinion. It is &s;aid, <HI>fir&s;tly,</HI> that, in all places and towns in America, which have been infected with the yellow fever, it has been ea&s;y to trace its origin to certain &s;hips from the We&s;t-Indies, &amp;c. Now, I &s;hall not recapitulate to you tho&s;e tedious enquiries into facts that every party have ingeniou&s;ly and with equal &s;ucce&s;s controverted; for, &s;hould they prove the po&s;&s;ibility of the impor|tation of the contagion, it will not affect our doc|trine. Such facts, indeed, ought rather to impre&s;s
<PB N="12" REF="034311_0020_0FFC3C4544B38978">upon our minds, the important truths of the dan|gerous effects of any kind of effluvia from cor|rupted vegetable or animal &s;ub&s;tances, which are &s;o often unavoidably engendered in the cargoes of &s;hips coming from tropical countries in the hot &s;ea&s;ons of the year. Of this, there are as many in&s;tances as there are eminent medical writers, on the &s;ubject of contagion.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The importation of the yellow fe|ver cannot be doubted, when it is &s;o often known to have raged on board of ve&s;&s;els both at &s;ea and in port. Indeed, the French have derived their name of this fever, from its peculiar frequency among &s;eaman; and &s;everal of their writers have called it <HI>la matelote.</HI> Be this as it may, two rea|&s;ons are obvious, even in our opinion, to render the yellow fever more frequent among &s;eamen. One is, that they are con&s;tantly predi&s;po&s;ed to bilious complaints, as we &s;hall hereafter explain; and the other, that they are continually expo&s;ed to putrid exhalations.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> If the&s;e towns and places had not re|ceived, the contagion from tropical countries, we &s;hould find in our hi&s;torical records more frequent in&s;tances of a malady that is &s;uppo&s;ed to be of a dome&s;tic origin. Formerly our &s;ummers were &s;till hotter, and more in&s;upportable than they are at pre&s;ent; and our towns, or rather villages, were de&s;titute of any improvement, were often filthy and nece&s;&s;arily neglected; yet they were remarkably
<PB N="13" REF="034311_0021_0FFC3C4387F9A810">healthy. Again&s;t objections &s;o ob&s;tinately urged, I could oppo&s;e undeniable proofs of great changes in many towns and places, of variations in the air, winds, and atmo&s;phere, from whole|&s;ome to pe&s;tilential, and <HI>vice ver&s;a</HI>; but we have no certain data from &s;uch fluctuating pre|mi&s;es to direct our enquiries. It is, therefore, un|nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t on them here, while we can, in a few words, &s;atisfy our rea&s;on and judgement from well-known facts, more applicable to the point in controver&s;y. Is it not true, that putrid effluvia, infections vapours, and poi&s;onous mia&s;|mata, mu&s;t be more abundant and permanent, more often generated, and more fully diffemina|ted, in populous and large towns than in villages or thinly inhabited places?</P>
<P>I do not find, gentlemen, among the Engli&s;h medical writers, any other peculiar opinion, on the origin of the yellow fever, except that of Dr. Warren, who implicitly believed, that it had been fir&s;t brought from Pale&s;tine to Mar|&s;eilles, and from thence to Martinico and to Bar|badoes, about thirty or forty years ago. All the works I have read, agree generally in the &s;upport of the doctrine of local exhalations. It is now time, however, for me to dwell a little on the opinions which, though much divided, have neverthele&s;s prevailed in Philadelphia, both among phy&s;icians and others. The college of phy|&s;icians of this city, had officially expre&s;&s;ed, in the
<PB N="14" REF="034311_0022_0FFC3C41494EF328">year 1793, an opinion, that the fever had been im|ported from the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, and that it was very contagious. They have, by no means, depar|ted this year, from that declaration. As we have not any publication, collectively, from that body, that could exhibit more, and &s;tronger arguments than merely their opinion of its importation, I &s;uppo&s;e, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ay any thing either for or again&s;t the opinion. An almo&s;t equal number of phy&s;icians, among whom are many eminent characters, have uniformly &s;upported the contrary doctrine, that the fever was of a dome&s;|tic origin; and that it re&s;ulted from corrupted &s;ub&s;tances in the cargoes confined in &s;hips' holes, as well as from tho&s;e impure exhalations to which we are expo&s;ed. Among the&s;e la&s;t, however, a di&s;tinction &s;hould be carefully made of tho&s;e who acknowledge its highly contagious nature, and the few who yet think that it is not of &s;uch a malignant character. I ha&s;ten to ob&s;erve, that this a&s;&s;ertion has been repeatedly publi&s;hed by a few European and We&s;t-India practitioners, who have had but few opportunities of &s;eeing many in&s;tances of the <HI>malady of Siam,</HI> at lea&s;t in Hi&s;pani|ola, where it has very &s;eldom appeared for the&s;e la&s;t twenty years, and where they have a better opportunity of treating the <HI>amphimerina bilio&s;a</HI> of Savage, or what they call la <HI>fievre lipyrienne,</HI> or the <HI>Tritacophya Americana</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Savage's No&s;ologia, cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, ii. febr.</NOTE>. The&s;e are

This capital mi&s;take has been, con&s;equently, connected with a&s;&s;er|tions de&s;titute of nece&s;&s;ary demon&s;tration; it has expo&s;ed to doubt, and almo&s;t denied, &s;ome fundamental principles of phi&s;iology and practice, re&s;pecting infectious di&s;orders and epidemics of camps, jails, &s;hips, and of all crowded places<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has narrowly reduced medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the in&s;uffici|ent method of diluting, cooling draughts, and feeble cathartics.</NOTE>. In a word, this mi&s;take has erected a doctrine void of the deference due to the authority of writers in the healing art of the former and pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P>I &s;hall analy&s;e, with more plea&s;ure, the contra|ry opinion, for which documents, enquiries, and liberal and candid di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, have been procu|red and unremittingly pur&s;ued by &s;everal phy&s;i|cians. Among the&s;e Dr. B. Ru&s;h de&s;erves particu|lar notice; becau&s;e he has &s;upported it, &s;ince the year 1793, both in his lectures of the in&s;titutes of medicine, in the univer&s;ity of Penn&s;ylvania, and in &s;everal treati&s;es he has &s;ince publi&s;hed on the yel|low fever. He has never cea&s;ed to warm his fel|low citizens of the pre&s;ence or proximity of the cau&s;e of this contagion, in their &s;ea-ports, wharves, &s;treets, and &s;tagnant waters. He has ex|plained the phenomena of exhalation from a com|bination of vegetable and and animal putrefac|tion; and, being aware, by long experience, and
<PB N="16" REF="034311_0024_0FFC3C3CCA51C110">an elightened judgement, that the inhabitants of this place were particularly &s;ubject to billious fe|vers during the autumn, from &s;udden changes, and the extremes of the climate, and from the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s and indige&s;tive quality of their aliments, he early under&s;tood that infectious mia&s;mata could aggra|vate the bilious remittent, and convert it into a ma|lignant and contagious fever. On this judicious ground he founded his theory and practice, and we &s;hall &s;ee hereafter of what importance it has been to the di&s;covery of truth, and the improve|ment of medical practice.</P>
<P>Having hitherto &s;tated, gentlemen, the hi&s;tori|cal opinions of the mo&s;t enlightened phy&s;icians of Europe and of America, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that it was my purpo&s;e to point out &s;uch of their opi|nions as were more congenial to the true ba&s;is of the theory to which I have confined my&s;elf; and to illu&s;trate a po&s;ition which has already occupi|ed &s;o greatly the public attention. I &s;hall add a few more arguments to &s;upport the local origin of the yellow fever and its highly contagious na|ture.</P>
<P>A &s;triking circum&s;tance was formerly exhibi|ted by Pouppe De&s;partes, a French phy&s;ician, &s;ent by the king into Hi&s;paniola. During many years he accurately ob&s;erved the &s;tate of the at|mo&s;phere in the &s;pring and &s;ummer. He noticed, that frequent and heavy rains, interrupted by &s;e|rene
<PB N="17" REF="034311_0025_0FFC3C3A8319B768">weather, and intervals of heat, in tho&s;e tro|pical countries, was productive of more dange|rous exhalations from the earth. He was thus ena|bled to foretell the appearance of the pe&s;tilential malady of Siam, as he called it. He ob&s;erved, al&s;o, that, after heavy rains, the noxious effects of ex|halations were checked by winds, or other circum|&s;tances. A few ca&s;es from this very ju&s;t authority, will &s;erve to warn the inhabitants of our towns of the terrible effects of the exhalations to which they will be expo&s;ed, by the concurrence of rains, after long draughts, with the inten&s;e heat of the &s;um|mers, if they retain among them&s;elves all the ma|terials of vegetable and animal corruption. The&s;e materials &s;eem to increa&s;e with our population; and, in Philadelphia, I believe, there are more of them than in any other town in the union. They may con&s;i&s;t of the logs which form our wharves, and which project to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance in the water; of the boards with which almo&s;t all in|clo&s;ures of lots and hou&s;es are &s;urrounded; of the roofs of all our hou&s;es; of numerous privy-hou&s;es which are &s;eldom emptied; and of many ponds and &s;tagnant waters, both in the city and &s;uburbs. If it &s;hould appear &s;trange to point out, among the &s;ources of exhalation, the very wood which we ne|ce&s;&s;arily make u&s;e of for our dwellings and ports, I intreat my reader, before he rejects my a&s;&s;ertion, carefully to enquire into the natured laws and effects of exhalations from wood, timbers, new
<PB N="18" REF="034311_0026_0FFC3C3790188778">&s;hips, cellars, fore&s;ts, &amp;c. of which he will find ample documents in the writings of doctor Lind and others. Let him call to mind the number of wooden works in all our cities and ports, where the tide &s;ucce&s;&s;ively uncovers and expo&s;es the wharves to the &s;chorching rays of the &s;un, and then let him draw his conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>In proof of the fermentation of animal &s;ub&s;tan|ces, particularly during the heat of &s;ummer, which I have already &s;ugge&s;ted, I &s;hall propo&s;e an expe|riment. Let a candle be lowered into a ditch, by means of a line, and it will be found, that the me|phitic a&s;cending gas, will put out the light in pro|portion as it approaches the &s;urface of the earth, and this effect will be much more certain in the latter end, than in the beginning of the hot &s;ea&s;on. When this gas a&s;cends and is received into the atmo&s;phere, it doubtle&s;s breeds contagion and death; and I am fully &s;atisfied, that many people have, as well as my&s;elf, perceived and &s;melt its effluvia, chiefly du|ring the calm and clear nights of the month of Sep|tember. Several intere&s;ting publications have appeared in the papers of Philadelphia on this &s;ub|ject<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been &s;trongly contended in &s;ame of them, that the wa|ters of the wells of Philadelphia are rendered noxious by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">utial grounds and others cau&s;es. I confe&s;s I have not yet heard &s;ufficient objections to de&s;troy this opinion. By the effect of &s;ome local im|pregnations, &s;everal of our wells are particularly remarked for their bad waters. A re&s;pectable chymi&s;t of this city, analy&s;ed the water of his own well, and found that it contained a quantity of magne&s;ia, muriatic &s;alt, and uncombined alkali. This certain|ly does not prove much in favour of our waters; and I am ful|ly aware, that this &s;ubject requires a more particular inve&s;tiation. I hope, therefore, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> all attract the attention and fix the ob&s;er|vation of &s;ome of our learned and philanthropic citizens.</NOTE>. From this &s;hort &s;ketch we may conclude,
<PB N="19" REF="034311_0027_0FFC3C3551F411C0">that the opinion of the yellow fever being generated among us, is founded upon good ground; and that it would be in vain to attack this opinion by the objections which have been mentioned and refu|ted above. For further &s;atisfaction, we &s;hall add, that the circum&s;tance of its having appeared but once in Philadelphia, before the year 1793, does not imply that it cannot be of a dome&s;tic origin; &s;ince it is obvious, that it might have ac|tually &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in &s;ome or few ca&s;es, among tho&s;e bilious fevers that are endemic among us in the autumn, without having been much taken notice of.</P>
<P>Would it be ju&s;t to &s;ay, that this epidemic has never made its appearance in Philadelphia, ex|cept in 1762, 1793, and 1797, while there are creditable witne&s;&s;es who have po&s;itively &s;een and ob&s;erved it, every year &s;ince the atten|tion of phy&s;icians and others has been kept up by the recollection of the calamity? This fever, though &s;o highly contagious as to be compared even to the plague, may, like the plague, be wide|ly propagated or entirely imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded by cau&s;es that favour of oppo&s;e its progre&s;s; for unaccoun|table changes and variations of heat and wea|ther,
<PB N="20" REF="034311_0028_0FFC3C33B93D1768">have &s;ometimes put an end to the latter in the heat of the &s;ummer, and they have al&s;o in|crea&s;ed it in the middle of the winter. The ca&s;e No. 1, was that of a father &s;urrounded with a numerous family of whom not one was infected but him&s;elf. The &s;ame fact has occurred to my ob&s;ervation, in almo&s;t every family, in which the di&s;order proved mortal. In &s;uch ca&s;es, the patients &s;ecrete very little of the putrid mia&s;|mata; they are much le&s;s infectious, becau&s;e the poi&s;on is kept in their body to de&s;troy the func|tions of life; and one of the mo&s;t deceiving &s;ymp|toms is, that they &s;eldom emit any di&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">able &s;mell. It is quite the rever&s;e, however, when they recover; and phy&s;icians and nur&s;es are well acquainted with the in&s;upportable foetor, peculiar to that fever, which exudes from their bodies, and continues, for a long time after, in their bed and clothes. Con&s;equently one or many mortal ca&s;es of the yellow fever may have happened, without having been followed by contagion.</P>
<P>But it is further objected, that the traces of the importation have been vi&s;ibly marked in Phila|delphia; where the fever, having been commu|nicated by &s;omebody from Southwark, has in|fected the mo&s;t di&s;tant part, which is Ken&s;ington, and the hou&s;es on the Frankford road; meanwhile there were but few &s;cattered ca&s;es in the centre and northern parts of the city. This la&s;t mentioned theatre of the di&s;ea&s;e, would, however, have been pre&s;erved from contagion if the epidemic was of
<PB N="21" REF="034311_0029_0FFC3C314DFEDAF0">a dome&s;tic origin; for the place is quite open, and pre&s;ents a view of many country &s;eats, and being not on the &s;ame &s;traight line of the town, it cannot receive its exhalations. However &s;triking and conclu&s;ive this whole objection &s;eems to be, yet what will be thought at la&s;t, by an unprejudi|ced reader, when he recollects that Ken&s;ington, and all the adjacent grounds, are wholly a kind of naval yard, full of timber, and more than any other part of our &s;uburbs, &s;urrounded with mar&s;hy grounds, and &s;tagnant waters. The adjacent banks of the river are, be&s;ides, filled up with all the rubbi&s;h of new and old timber. So much for the origin of the yellow fever in Ken&s;ington, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of the opinion, that the yellow fever is of dome&s;tic origin, why &s;hould we not derive, gentlemen, &s;ome authority from the medical doctrine already known and promul|gated in all the &s;chools of the world; of the po&s;|&s;ible infection of di&s;orders generated in places where people are crowded, or where unwhole&s;ome exhalations are produced? The hi&s;tory of jail di&s;tempers, of fevers on board of fleets, and of va|rious di&s;orders in camps, teaches us that it is not requi&s;ite to &s;earch for the origin of our calamity in di&s;tant countries. We mu&s;t not be unaccu&s;tomed to the id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, that our atmo&s;phere may be poi&s;oned as ea&s;ily as a plant growing in our fields.

To incredulous and &s;y&s;tematic theori&s;ts, I &s;hall exhibit the faithful evidences which we may derive from the in&s;tinct of ominous birds. If my mind was not di&s;tracted by error and prejudice, I &s;aw, repeatedly, during the two in|&s;tances of our calamity, vultures flying over our afflicted town. The&s;e kinds of volatile and carnivorous animals, never wander but in the currents of mia&s;mata and putrefaction. This is the means by which, in a few hours, they reach their di&s;tant and putrid prey. This is al&s;o a proof that our atmo&s;phere was infected with the corruption which created our epidemic. For an imported di&s;order cannot infect the atmo&s;phere, any more than our &s;ources of exhalation.</P>
<P>It remains now with me, gentlemen, to make a few more ob&s;ervations on the contagious power of the yellow fever. I have already notice, that very few opponents have appeared again&s;t that opini|on; and it is certain, it will meet with none in the &s;chools of America. The doctrine of the noxious qualities or &s;ub&s;tances of which the air and winds may be the vehicles, has been handed down to us by Hypocrates; and wonderful im|provements in chymi&s;try have &s;till letter explain|ed this truth, and all its phenomena; for the
<PB N="23" REF="034311_0031_0FFC3C2C08D64C70">idea of contagion implies nothing el&s;e but the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of certain principles of di&s;order, whether conveyed through the medium of the air or by an immediate contact. When this effect takes place, bodies are &s;aid to be infected; and &s;urely as many di&s;orders as by their particular effluvia always excite the &s;ame morbid &s;tate, &s;o many mu&s;t be contagious. Happily, in the long catalogue of di&s;ea&s;es to which we are &s;ubject, the&s;e are, comparatively, few.

<P>This fleet was, at fir&s;t, joined at Bre&s;t by two &s;hips of the line, the <HI>Gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> and the <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e de B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rgogne,</HI> both of which had received on board &s;ome men from the ho&s;pital at Rochefort. Dur|ing their &s;tay at Bre&s;t, the contagion was &s;o rapid, that they were obliged to &s;end four hundred of their &s;ick on &s;hore.</P>
<P>On the 3d of May, the fleet &s;ailed from Bre&s;t to Loui&s;bourg, but both during their pa&s;&s;age to, and &s;tay in that port, the fever became general, and was attended with a con&s;iderable mortali|ty. On the 20th of October, the fleet &s;ailed from Loui&s;bourg, ta|king on board their &s;ick, but leaving about four hundred in a dy|ing &s;tare. At &s;ea, the contagion acquired new vigour In a very &s;hort, time, the whole &s;quadron was di&s;abled; and, on their ar|rival at Bre&s;t, on the 22d of November, the few remaining &s;ea|men were &s;carcely &s;ufficient to navigate their &s;hips, having no le&s;s than four thou&s;and men ill. All their &s;urgeons and almoners were either &s;ick or dead; and, when they arrived, &s;eamen were immediately &s;ent on board to bring them to anchor, and &s;urgeons to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;ick. Unfortunately four thou&s;and more arrived, at the &s;ame time, from Quebec, in the <HI>Bizarre</HI> and <HI>Celebre,</HI> two men of war, into which the &s;ickne&s;s was communicated by the above &s;quadrom. During the general confu&s;ion, they had been promi&s;|cuou&s;ly crowded into the town of Bre&s;t, wherever they could get admi&s;&s;ion. Fifteen ho&s;pitals were at la&s;t &s;itted up. Phy&s;icians and &s;urgeons came from all parts of France, and voluntarily gave their &s;ervices, be&s;ides tho&s;e who were commi&s;&s;ioned by the court. The ho&s;pitals were &s;o crowded, that at la&s;t the mortality &s;pread among the attendants. Five phy&s;icians, one hundred and fifty &s;urgeons, and two hundred almoners and nur&s;es, fell victims, together with a great number of &s;laves, who were engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;ick, upon a promi&s;e to receive their liberty. From the attendants, the fever pa&s;&s;ed to the lower cla&s;s of people in Bre&s;t, among whom it quickly diffu&s;ed it&s;elf. The havoc then became general; and the hou&s;es were filled with the dying and the dead. A proclamation from authority, had promi&s;ed the &s;ick, that they would be provided with the attendance of a phy&s;ician, or any other nece&s;&s;ary means of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if they would give proper notice. But, it was &s;oon found, that, in many hou&s;es not one was left who could give the nonce, and that, in others dead bodies had remained without burial. In &s;ine, the month of April brought a gradual and ab&s;olute ce&s;&s;ation of this contagious epidemic, which, in le&s;s than five months, &s;wept off ten thou&s;and people in the ho&s;pitals alone, be&s;ides the inhabitants who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied in the town of Bre&s;t, and who could not be numbered!!!</P></NOTE>!

It was not like an epidemic which &s;trikes only at certain in|dividuals, of the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition, or defects of con&s;titution; and thus di&s;clo&s;es, at la&s;t, what kind of victim it endangers. It does not, like the ague, threaten tho&s;e of lax nerves and fibres; like the catarrhs or influenza, falling upon the humourous; like the autumnal fevers, afflicting the bilious; and like inflammatory di&s;orders, &s;ei|zing upon the plethoric; no, the yellow fever has &s;pared neither &s;ex nor age.

Its irre|gular march and progre&s;s, its appearance in op|po&s;ite extremities of the city, without any vi&s;ible way of propagation, could not be explain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

<P>Moreover, the&s;e principles and facts cannot, in the lea&s;t, be invalidated by objecting, that a con|tagious di&s;order could not remain confined in maritime towns; and that, like the plague, it would have found its way to populated coun|try places; for even the plague abated entirely in Aleppo in the height of the &s;ummer, when the extreme heat, dilating too much the pe&s;tilential mia&s;mata, probably rendered them harmle&s;s. It di&s;appeared in Vienna, in 1713, as &s;oon as tem|pe&s;tuous winds blew away its aerial venom. By other unaccountable cau&s;es, it equally broke out during the winter and &s;ummer, and al&s;o equal|ly di&s;appeared, during each contrary &s;ea&s;on, in Ok&s;acow, in the years 1737 and 1738. If the plague could be checked by contrary changes of &s;ea&s;on, and even by the heat of the &s;ummer, who will be a&s;toni&s;hed at finding that &s;ome rea&s;ons al&s;o excludes generally the yellow fever from the coun|try?

<HEAD>SECTION II.
Phy&s;iological and Pathological De&s;cription of the Yellow Fever.</HEAD>
<P>FROM all the documents which have been tran&s;|mitted to us, both by Engli&s;h and French writers, there is no room to doubt, that the di&s;order which they have called the malady of Siam, the <HI>mate|lote,</HI> or the yellow fever, is exactly the &s;ame which has, in &s;everal in&s;tances, raged among us. It &s;eems, however, that our epidemic, differs, though not materially, in &s;ome of its &s;ymptoms, from that of the tropical countries. Dr. John&s;on, has, indeed, acknowledged three kinds of yellow fever. With re&s;pect to them, I &s;hall, ju&s;t &s;imply remark, that, if there are three di&s;tinct and appa|rent degrees, they mu&s;t be owing to the following obvious circum&s;tances. Fir&s;t, that of its effects or attacks on a patient who quickly becomes its vic|tim; &s;econd, of one who, without great difficul|ty, or danger, pa&s;&s;es through its &s;tages; and la&s;tly, if tho&s;e, who, with proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance, get over the re&s;olution and cri&s;is. The&s;e three characters, are, undoubtedly, the natural re&s;ult of the differ|ent degrees of contagion, or of the con&s;titution, habit, and previous complaints of the patient. There is con&s;equently out one &s;ort of yellow fe|ver. This malady &s;hould, be&s;ides, be con&s;idered only during two of its periods, that of its <HI>&s;ymptoms</HI> and that of the <HI>cri&s;is.</HI> In practice, this divi&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="29" REF="034311_0037_0FFC3C1E340FED38">a very ju&s;t one. It traces, exactly, the limits of medical treatment, and is a &s;ure mean of &s;ug|ge&s;ting true progno&s;tics<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I beg tho&s;e of my medical readers who are profe&s;&s;edly at|tached to the &s;y&s;tem of Dr. Brown, and which appears to have been i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="7 letters">ed into the univer&s;ity of Penn&s;ylvania, to direct the u&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of prejudice again&s;t a theory, and to examine with can|dour a work, written in the good old &s;cientifical language of Hy|pocrates, Boerhaave, and Cullen; for I have not any prejudice my&s;elf again&s;t them.
<Q>Till this day, theories have often changed, while practice remains the &s;ame: and it was the doctrine of a celebrated author (Dr. Cullen) that medical hypothe&s;is is but a chain to link facts together,</Q>
(<HI>Analytical Review, Arg.</HI> 1789, <HI>Art.</HI> viii.l I have often been indured to contemplate this doc|trine, either from the con&s;ideration that men of great genius and information have adapted it, or from a determined re&s;olution not to condemn, what, perhaps. I did not properly under&s;tand. With great reluctance, however, I would have exchanged tho&s;e &s;imple elements that &s;o ea&s;ily explain the laws of nature, the phe|nomena of life and vegetation, for a metaphi&s;ical theory, which, from the po&s;itive qualities of bodies and &s;ub&s;tances, carries us in|to a &s;eries of complex and occult modes of action. If a per&s;on can under&s;tand all the phenomena of health and life, by the ob&s;cure ideas of excitement being always evolved in a ratio to the quan|tity of the excitability, and exciting powers, which mu&s;t al|ways bear a due proportion to each other, &amp;c. let him enjoy his conviction. But, why cannot the &s;ame conviction re&s;ult from the &s;imple laws of human life, as anatomy and phi&s;iology exhibit them to our ob&s;ervation? As for the &s;ucce&s;s, which might in practice be derived from that theory, it is a delicate matter, and I will not avail my&s;elf of tho&s;e &s;arca&s;tic comments upon it which I have frequently read. This much I can &s;ay, that I believe the doctrine may be of &s;ome advantage with men of genius, but I am &s;atisfied that it leads to capital mi&s;takes, tho&s;e who di|rect them&s;elves by it, whil&s;t they do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ufficiently the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of nature.</NOTE>. When death is unavoid|ably
<PB N="30" REF="034311_0038_0FFC3C1CACD1B970">the final re&s;ult of this di&s;order, it is equally horrid and in&s;idious. Penetration and attention are, therefore, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential requi|&s;ites to keep us from indulging tho&s;e erroneous and fal&s;e hopes, which, both the patient and his friends, are too apt to entertain. A turgency of the blood ve&s;&s;els, or what we call a plethoric &s;tate, may, during one or two days, precede the attack, but is &s;eldom taken notice of by the patient; and no other previous indi&s;po&s;ition can be remarked. Whatever then may be the &s;tate of the body, the fever &s;uddenly and tumultuou&s;ly breaks out. Spon|taneous vomitings of yellow, green, and gluti|nous bile; a depre&s;&s;ing head ache; a numbne&s;s of the limbs, and joints; a burning heat in the face; and redne&s;s in the eyes; imme|diately take place. Such rapid and violent changes in the whole frame, are, I believe, un|common in any kind of fever, and belong only to the plague. During the two fir&s;t days, this &s;tate admits of but little change. Short intermi&s;|&s;ions, are, however, &s;ometimes obtained by means of the remedies which are admini&s;tered. The patient may po&s;&s;e&s;s all the other febrile &s;ymp|toms; but I have &s;een none of them more fre|quent than delirium and coma. We next di&s;|cover an ominous and ab&s;olute pro&s;tration of &s;trength, an abatement in the pul&s;e, an entire ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation of feeling, and an in&s;idious &s;ecurity in the patient, who fancies him&s;elf fa&s;t approaching
<PB N="31" REF="034311_0039_0FFC3C1A700C0898">to a recovery, and who only complains of a want of &s;trength. He &s;oon after, however, expe|riences frequent and &s;hort chills; and his evacua|tions are colliquative, foetid, with yellow or white matter. He then &s;ighs deeply; is re&s;tle&s;s; and he cannot even bear the weight of a covering upon his body. He next appears totally in&s;en&s;ible either to heat or cold; his &s;kin is dry; there is no kind of exhalation of di&s;agreeable &s;mell about him, and even very little is perceived from his breath. He has no thir&s;t, but he can drink any thing. Nau&s;eous medicines, or agreeable food, are alike received into his &s;tomach without &s;ick|ening it. His tongue as yet portends nothing alarming; it is covered, however, with a kind of thick white cru&s;t, from the root to the edges, which remain perfectly red. In this &s;tate his urine &s;eems &s;topped, although he drinks much; and, if he voids any, it is generally purulent. This period of the di&s;ea&s;e, in which the delu&s;ion of the patient exi&s;ts, notwith&s;tanding the ce&s;&s;ation of his regular functions, is highly expre&s;&s;ive of the di&s;order being unconquerable; and I ven|ture to a&s;&s;ert, that when it is ob&s;erved in the &s;econd or third day, it ought to determine the phy&s;ician to give over, without he&s;itation, the lea&s;t hope of a recovery. The patient will be in the agonies of death as &s;oon as the third day arrives, and never later than the fifth.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="034311_0040_0FFC3C182223B730">Another more in&s;idious &s;tage than the former, may take place in the beginning of the di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e, and la&s;t two or three days. It is not &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in its progre&s;s, but is equally fatal in its i&s;&s;ue. In this ca&s;e, an ardent fever, which, however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y be occa&s;ionally abated by judicious re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> is the only characteri&s;tic.

On this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. I cannot too &s;trongly in&s;i&s;t: for here the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of that &s;ickne&s;s lies, in which it is &s;o difficult to re|cover any dangerous &s;ymptoms. Several of them are, however, to be remarked.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Although the patient may be acted upon by medicines, he is certainly deprived of &s;alutary evacuations; and chiery of tho&s;e which we &s;hall hereafter de&s;cribe as the only proof of a &s;ucce&s;sful treatment. To be deprived of them, before the third day, is a &s;ure progno&s;tic of death.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>Secondly,</HI> The patient complains but little; and a kind of &s;tupidity, re&s;ulting from the &s;low|ne&s;s of his ideas, forms a &s;triking contra&s;t with the watchfulne&s;s and the confu&s;ion of his countenance. This &s;ymptom is more alarming, and is direc|tly oppo&s;ite to the inqui&s;itive anxiety and irre&s;i&s;|table unea&s;ine&s;s of patients in common ca&s;es. Tho&s;e, therefore, who are be&s;t acquainted with the natural di&s;po&s;ition of the per&s;on who is &s;ick, will be be&s;t able to judge of this deci&s;ive &s;ymptom.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="034311_0041_0FFC3C15E97697F0"><HI>Thirdly,</HI> In all his actions the patient &s;hews an uncommon degree of &s;trength; while repeated exacerbations of fever, frequent bloodlettings, and want of nouri&s;hment, &s;hould render him very weak. This very &s;trength, however, is unnatural and contrary to the appearance ob&s;erved in fa|vourable ca&s;es. It is the effect of an univer&s;al &s;pa&s;|modic con&s;triction of the nerves, and indicates the dreadful action of the morbid cau&s;e upon the vi&s;|cera, and its manife&s;ted by a kind of trill in the nerves, or by an involuntary fluttering in the mu&s;cles, which we may evidently perceive, if we keep, attentively, during a few minutes, the hand or the arm of the patient in our hand. This la&s;t &s;ign claimed my particular notice, and it has al|ways proved &s;ingularly u&s;eful to me.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> and la&s;tly, we may always di&s;cover, that each of the exacerbations of the fever are preceded by <HI>horripilatio,</HI> or violent chill. After the&s;e four &s;ymptoms have taken place, we &s;hould never put any dependence either on the pul&s;e or the tongue; for, whether the pul&s;e be febrile or not, intermitting or regular, it progno&s;|ticates nothing deci&s;ive for the patient, unle&s;s we can di&s;tingui&s;h it hard, and ten&s;e, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;pa&s;modic and fatal con&s;triction. The tongue al&s;o pre&s;ages nothing conclu&s;ive; it will be found white or &s;oul all over its upper &s;urface, and its edges red. If the patient remains for &s;ome time
<PB N="34" REF="034311_0042_0FFC3C13B16CB1D8">without drink, a triangular red &s;pot will appear from the edge to the centre of the tongue. But after a diluting draught this di&s;appears; and the&s;e &s;tates take place, both in ca&s;es of death and recovery. One appearance of the tongue, however, is omi|nous in the fir&s;t days of the di&s;ea&s;e; which is, when it turns black or brown, before the la&s;t exa|cerbation of the fever, which generally &s;ub&s;ides on the fourth day. Iliccough or an ab&s;olute &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine, are likewi&s;e very dangerous &s;ymptoms, if they take place before the time of the re&s;olution of the fever; but if the fir&s;t hap|pens after it, it happily con&s;titutes the final and &s;alutary cri&s;is.</P>
<P>Another &s;ymptom u&s;ual in malignant fevers, but particularly in this, is a kind of &s;mall red petechiae, very &s;imilar to free bites. They appear on the hands, the neck, the brea&s;t, and al&s;o on the face. Many &s;uppo&s;e that they are from the bites of mu&s;quitoes, or of other in&s;ects. A phy&s;ician may know better, but cannot derive from them any thing further than a proof of the malignancy of the fever. (Vide ca&s;e No. 4.)</P>
<P>I dwell more particularly upon the&s;e apparent|ly trifling circum&s;tances, becau&s;e they are of the utmo&s;t importance towards a&s;&s;i&s;ting us in our en|quiries. Phy&s;icians are, alas! pecularly liable to error in a di&s;order &s;o difficult to judge, and &s;o violent in its attacks. From an affectionate regard
<PB N="35" REF="034311_0043_0FFC3C116FD5AE88">to their patients, or from a rea&s;onable pride in their own medical &s;kill, they are &s;ometimes over confident of their &s;ucce&s;s; and too frequently, in the event, the friends of the patient, are unhappily plunged into di&s;pair, at the di&s;appointment of their expectations. Would it not be more pru|dent, then, in ca&s;es of iminent danger, to cau|tion them again&s;t it; and thus, when the utmo&s;t of our &s;kill is baffled, to de&s;erve their confidence and gratitude by our candour?</P>
<P>I now arrive at that fatal period, when, by the deadly effect of the decompo&s;ition and mor|tification of the animal fluids, all the &s;truggles of nature are entirely overcome. On the fourth day, this period is announced by the palene&s;s of the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and the extreme debility of the pul&s;e; unle&s;s, indeed, as it frequently happens, a &s;till more vio|lent degree of contagion has, through uncommon circum&s;tances, produce the&s;e &s;ymptoms &s;ooner. The feelings of the unhappy patient have now lo&s;t &s;o much of their power that he is totally incapable of giving any account of his confu&s;ed &s;en&s;ations. His &s;kin becomes gradually tinged with a yellowi&s;h colour, while his lower extremities become of a deep red and are a little &s;welled. The eyes loo&s;e that remarkable animation which they before po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, and appear de&s;ponding; while the coun|tenance becomes confu&s;ed and grim. Nau&s;ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at this period, is a common &s;ymptom. If drink be thrown up, it is not altered from the
<PB N="36" REF="034311_0044_0FFC3C0E65162BD0">&s;tate in which it was taken, unle&s;s indeed, by ha|ving acquired a ropine&s;s, and being mixed with &s;mall flakes of dark coloured matter. A black or brown fluid, much like coffee grounds, is next vo|mitted. If this does not take place, it is only owing to a want of &s;trength; and the &s;tomach is, then, much more oppre&s;&s;ed; and the patient may be expected to die early in the fifth day, or &s;ooner. Stools are al&s;o frequent and ea&s;y, but very offen&s;ive. They are yellow, grey, and of a &s;ooty colour, and contain a few flakes of white or red. Delirium in this &s;tage is very common. Frequent in&s;tances are al&s;o &s;een of patients pre&s;er|ving their rea&s;on till the la&s;t moment, (Vide ca&s;e No. 4,) when a cloud &s;uffu&s;es their eyes, and makes them aver&s;e to the light. During all this time, the pul&s;e is in a deceiving &s;tate. It keeps, for the mo&s;t part, quite calm, and is a little febrile, or perhaps not &s;o at all. It occa&s;ionally, however, appears intermitting, unequal, and different on one &s;ide of the body from what it is on the other. This is generally its la&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of energy, and may be owing to a &s;pa&s;modic con&s;triction. In &s;uch ca&s;es, it &s;ometimes ri&s;es to an unexpected vigour, and is the forerunner of a temporary re|lief. The patient talks much of his expected reco|very, and will &s;ometimes even try, with &s;ucce&s;s, to give deceiving proofs of it. He wi&s;hes to take exerci&s;e and to pur&s;ue his bu&s;ine&s;s. He will get up; want to dre&s;s him&s;elf; and will walk very

Every one was a&s;|toni&s;hed, and would remark no other alterations than that of a deep orange colour all over his bo|dy, an incoherence in his conver&s;ation, and a very confu&s;ed look. How &s;hort, alas! and deceiving is this la&s;t &s;park of life? A cool moi&s;ture and a total pro&s;tration of &s;trength &s;ucceeds, and &s;uddenly conquers this ela&s;ticity of the fibres. On a &s;udden, the pul&s;e di&s;appears; the extreme|ties cool; the convul&s;ions of the &s;tomach are re|newed, with accute pains, cau&s;ed by a &s;light pre&s;|&s;ure in the abdomen; and a deplorable, though &s;hort agony, terminates the di&s;order, after having diffu&s;ed a putrifying poi&s;on in the blood, and de&s;|troyed the noble&s;t vi&s;cera by mortification. (Vide ca&s;e No. 5.)</P>
<P>Such are the periods and &s;ymptoms of the yel|low fever, which has been di&s;tingui&s;hed, by &s;e|veral writers, as a particular &s;pecies of the mo&s;t malignant kind. When there exi&s;ts an error in the treatment, or any dangerous circum&s;tances in the con&s;titution of the patient, he mu&s;t certainly fall a victim. The di&s;ea&s;e remains the &s;ame, however, in its nature and operation; and we will find, among tho&s;e who happily recover, no other chan|ges than tho&s;e which con&s;titute an i&s;&s;ue prompted by accidental or unavoidable cau&s;es, and which take certain modifications from the con&s;titution, the &s;ex, the age, or previous indi&s;po&s;ition of the
<PB N="38" REF="034311_0046_0FFC3C0A99891FE8">patient. Let us now direct our enquiry further, by a review of the different &s;tages of the malady, when it can be conquered by nature or by art.</P>
<P>It was the doctrine of Hippocrates, that, on the breaking out of any acute malady, there were &s;ymptoms pointedly progno&s;ticating its fatal i&s;&s;ue, or the probability of its cure. Thus he remarked, that, if the patient, on being taken, was di&s;cove|red involuntarily to &s;hed tears, or if he was &s;ei|zed with convul&s;ive fits, he would either die, or labour under a very long and dangerous attack. Medical practice, in our day, is, however, great|ly improved, and is attended with far different and happier re&s;ults. We have &s;een and known many who have recovered from pe&s;tilential and malignant di&s;orders, who, at fir&s;t, had exhi|bited the mo&s;t portentous &s;ymptoms. (Vide ca&s;es No. 6 and 7.) Whatever the&s;e &s;ymptoms may be, in the fir&s;t day of the di&s;ea&s;e, any unfavoura|ble judgement mu&s;t be &s;u&s;pended. In fact, if obvi|ous indications have been faithfully followed, on the &s;econd day, we may di&s;cover beneficial and critical per&s;pirations, remi&s;&s;ions of the fever, and &s;alutary evacuations. The latter mu&s;t be repea|ted, copious, and of a dark green colour. In&s;tead of that pro&s;tration of organic &s;trength, which we have noticed above, the patient complains only of a natural weakne&s;s; and when he takes refre&s;h|ment, by a few hours of &s;leep, he keeps a peace|able &s;ituation in his bed. Upon comparative ob&s;er|vation,
<PB N="39" REF="034311_0047_0FFC3C079D53C830">it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that, in&s;tead of weakening the organic &s;en&s;ations, the yellow fe|fever irritates and heightens their powers; for, if but a &s;ight do&s;e of phy&s;ic be given to the patient it will be very powerfully felt. His ta&s;te is like|wi&s;e equally affected by nau&s;eous medicines, by refre&s;hing liquors, and by the mo&s;t whole&s;ome nouri&s;hments. The coma and delirium may take place, without being ominous; the pul&s;e may be rapid and revul&s;ive without a convul&s;ive con&s;tric|tion. The lea&s;t noi&s;e provokes in him a &s;orrowful anxiety; but this &s;ymptom is for better than a deceiving &s;ecurity and a portentous ce&s;&s;ation of his complaints. The fever keeps the patient, ge|nerally, in this &s;ituation for three days. On the fourth, the change operates; and is, indeed, con|nected with &s;ome apparently dangerous circum|&s;tances, which are very critical; but, which, in the end, become &s;alutary. The chief of the&s;e are, the affection of the &s;tomach, and its repeated nau|&s;ea, joined to frequent vomitings, attended with a pain which a gentle pre&s;&s;ure accutely exa&s;perates. Proper medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance gradually relieves this and other acciedents; but, until the &s;ixth day, no &s;afe proofs of a good i&s;&s;ue are to be perceived. Should, however, a few paroxi&s;ns of fever be re|peated, &s;o much the better, provided they are unattended with a chill. The&s;e will &s;erve to de|termine a happy re&s;olution; for the yellow fever, when treated with &s;ucce&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, runs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">es</HI>

It is not inter&s;per&s;ed with any &s;hade or red &s;pots, and there are &s;carcely any which are apparent on the extremities. This jaundice begins to di&s;ap|pear on the &s;eventh day. In the beginning, the tongue does not much differ from what I have above de&s;cribed in the wor&s;t ca&s;es. In the&s;e ca&s;es however, it every day acquires a more uniform palene&s;s, or &s;mall red &s;pots; and upon the whole &s;eems of a more &s;pongy and porous &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>It is a general ob&s;ervation in medicine, that in proportion as the re&s;olution of an acute di&s;ea&s;e is perfect, the weaker the patient afterwards feels him&s;elf. This &s;tate of the body is al&s;o, one of the be&s;t means by which we can judge of the &s;afety of organic life. Agreeably to the&s;e principles, the pa|tient who recovers from the yellow fever under|goes great exertions and a very difficult &s;truggle. In this exhau&s;ted &s;tate, he is doomed to a tedious convale&s;cence, and may e&s;teem him&s;elf happy if he recover from it in a &s;pace of time equal to that of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Several other circum&s;tances more particularly de&s;ignating the character of the yellow fever, when carried to a &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue, remain to be mentioned.</P>

<P>The fifth frequently took place as a pain, but never as a &s;uppuration.</P>

In fact, we learn, by the pathology of the human body, that, in all acute di&s;orders, Nature re|quires a certain &s;pace of time either to cure, to re&s;olve, or to di&s;per&s;e the morbid cau&s;e under which the body is labouring; and the mo&s;t per|fect proof that the attempts of art or of nature have failed is when we too early di&s;cover incom|plete effects or a fal&s;e cri&s;is.

<P>The opinion that the yellow fever is a true bi|lious one, and differs only in degree, which is the highe&s;t and the mo&s;t malignant, has been al|ready known and &s;atisfactorily proved by Dr. B. Ru&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Account of the bilious remitting yellow fever, &amp;c. in the year 1793, by B. Ru&s;h. M. D.</NOTE>. With this principle as a guide, many er|rors, &s;y&s;tems and conjectures might have been long &s;ince di&s;pelled, or at lea&s;t better explained. The hi&s;tory of its &s;ymptoms, exhibits, in the plain|e&s;t manner, the corruption and malignancy of the bile. As &s;oon as the patient is &s;eized, he &s;pon|taneou&s;ly vomits bile; and if he recover, it is by the means of &s;ucce&s;sful and copious evacuations of hepatic and cy&s;tic bile. If he die, it is evident|ly in con&s;equence of the mixture of the bile with the blood, and the mortification of all its vi&s;cera and re&s;ervoirs. All the anxieties, nau&s;ea, pains, ob&s;tructions, and exacerbations of fever, in every ca&s;e, &s;eem evidently cau&s;ed by the fermentation, the &s;tagnation, and the acrimony of the bile. In &s;hort, if morbid bodies be examined by defection, new ravages of the bile are al&s;o di&s;covered. From
<PB N="44" REF="034311_0052_0FFC3BFBD69D5E20">the&s;e facts, what other inferences can be drawn, but that of fixing the pathology of the yellow fe|ver in tho&s;e laws and accidents that are connected with the bile. In order then to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome rea|&s;onable ground, let us fir&s;t enquire to what uni|form cau&s;e we may attribute all the above men|tioned &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>Hippocrates has ob&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aphor. 62. Sect. IV.</NOTE>, that autumnal fe|vers were attended with jaundice, in con&s;equence of people living upon rich beef, and Boer|haave admits acrid bile and poi&s;on among the cau&s;es of the wor&s;t kind of jaundice. The liver, from its nature and functions, receives a great quantity of blood from the <HI>venaporta,</HI> to prepare the bile; we may therefore conclude, that di&s;ea&s;es of that vi&s;cera, might di&s;turb or alter the bile, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> But, if a poi&s;onous exhalation has, by its affinity with the bile, diffu&s;ed it&s;elf in the alimentary canal, it is very probable that the infection will early reach, by many known pa&s;&s;ages, its very &s;ource; and the liver, the gall bladder, the duodenum, the &s;tomach, &amp;c. will then be di&s;ea&s;ed by a poi&s;oned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which &s;timu|lates, inflames, and corrodes th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">e <HI>the &s;pontaneous vomitings of the bile.</HI> Be&s;ides, before this infected bile could be &s;ufficiently diluted, neutralized, and evacuated, it is obvious to think, that the whole liver,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Icterus multiplex. &sect; 916.</NOTE> being affected either direct|ly

Method of Treatment of the Yellow Fever.</HEAD>
<P>WITHIN the&s;e la&s;t five years, the period in which the yellow fever has made its general appearance in America, &s;everal methods of treatment have been publi&s;hed here; and the &s;ame &s;ubject has al&s;o been ably di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by ma|ny eminent We&s;t-India writers. I will not, gen|tlemen, attempt to comment or decide upon the re&s;pective merits of either; but, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I have never yet been able &s;ufficiently to di&s;cover by what indications the u&s;e of their re|medies was to be directed. Thus it frequently happens that they &s;ometimes &s;ucceed and &s;ome|times not; and the mercury, bleedings, bark, cold or warm baths, acids, bli&s;ters, &amp;c. often fail|ed even in the hands of tho&s;e who contended the mo&s;t warmly for their application. If they afterwards attempted to explain under what circum&s;tances their propo&s;ed method has fail|ed, they have generally offered vague pretences and uncertain rules. Let us then, with can|dour, declare this unexceptionable rule in me|dicine, that no method of cure &s;hould ever be depended on, unle&s;s it be founded on &s;uch
<PB N="50" REF="034311_0058_0FFC3BEE42E85E98">rational grounds that the remedies employed will an&s;wer, under every circum&s;tance, the indications of the di&s;ea&s;e. Experience has, at la&s;t, proved that bleeding and mercury are &s;ufficiently powerful to conquer the mo&s;t ma|lignant degrees of the yellow fever; yet, in the u&s;e of the&s;e remedies, the greate&s;t care and cir|cum&s;pection are requi&s;ite in order to in&s;ure their &s;ucce&s;s. Before I enter upon the explana|tion of my method of treatment of the yellow fever, and of the proper mode of admini&s;|tering the&s;e fundamental remedies, &s;uffer me, gentlemen, to ob&s;erve, that, in America at lea&s;t, Dr. B. Ru&s;h has the honour to &s;tand foremo&s;t in &s;upport of their efficacy. While no other method &s;eemed equally &s;ucce&s;sful, that of ve|ne&s;ection and calomel was &s;upported, during the two in&s;tances of our calamity, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t bitter invectives and &s;arca&s;tic publica|tions were continually levelled again&s;t it. Some unfortunate and un&s;ucce&s;sful ca&s;es were held out as proofs of its danger; and the charge of pro|fu&s;e and indi&s;criminate bleeding was exbited as a murderous practice.

<P>It is only from the pathology of the yellow fever, that any &s;afe or efficacious rules for its cure can be derived. For every judicious ob|&s;erver, will candidly acknowledge, that, if the numerous remedies which have hitherto been re|commended for the yellow fever, have produced a cure, they have likewi&s;e too frequently failed.

<P>T ... B ... about twenty-two years of age, was of a &s;ound con&s;titution, and of a regular life. He had lately lo&s;t his father and a brother in the prevailing fever. After their death, he, with the re&s;t of the family, went into the country; but he had already been infected with the contagion. This was &s;oon manife&s;ted by all the alarming &s;ymptoms, but chiefly by the &s;pontaneous puking of the bile. He was immediately carried back to town, where proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance might be obtained; and, before a phy&s;ician could be &s;ent for, an expe|rienced nur&s;e had ordered him to be copiou&s;ly bled, and had given him a do&s;e of &s;alts. The&s;e orders were good but in&s;ufficient, and nothing further was done until the evening of the &s;econd day. At this time I was called in, when I found him extremely ill, and very nearly approaching to that pro&s;tration of organic action which does not even give time for an exacerbation of fever. Having ju&s;t lo&s;t his parent and a brother with this &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, he could not but con&s;ider him&s;elf al&s;o as a devoted victim. His &s;pirits were, there|fore
<PB N="54" REF="034311_0062_0FFC3BE518699E58">uncommonly low, and he appeared invo|luntarily to shed tears. This circum&s;tance, agree|ably to the rule of Hippocrates, I con&s;idered as an ominous and fatal progno&s;tic. A confu&s;ed and gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ntenants, cold extremities, and a hard and low pul&s;e, marked the rapid progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, during only thirty hours of &s;ickne&s;s.

Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> I kept his pul&s;e and hand within n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, they acquired a &s;en&s;ible energy. His extre|mities became warm; and, wi&s;hing to remove every ob&s;tacle to the operations of the treatment, I immediately ordered a carminative and nitrous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Thus I con&s;idered that the previous conge&s;tion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the foeces might be di&s;charged, and that the &s;ub&s;equent and nece&s;&s;ary evacuations could no lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">r be retarded. At night, the patient was, agreeably to my wi&s;hes and expecta|tations,
<PB N="55" REF="034311_0063_0FFC3BE2CBDC29D0">&s;eized with a violent exacerbation of fever, attended with delirium. This &s;tate gave the po|&s;itive, indication of a copious bleeding; for by it I fulfilled the &s;econd fundamental indication abovementioned, viz. that of emptying the blood-ve&s;&s;els, when the blood can be no longer admit|ted into the liver, and when the large ve&s;&s;els are in a &s;tate of infection. Agreeably to this indica|tion, the patient lo&s;t fifteen ounces of blood on the night of the &s;econd day. Without lo&s;ing-time, the bile was to be evacuated; for a favour|able relaxation, and an ab&s;olute ce&s;&s;ation of &s;pa&s;ms, irritation, and inflammation, always &s;uc|ceed a copious bleeding, and at this time the me|dicines have con&s;equently more power. I direc|ted the patient, therefore, to take immediately, and every two hours after, a do&s;e of calomel <HI>gvi.</HI> jalap, <HI>gx.</HI> and &s;camm. of Alep. <HI>gii..</HI> This pre&s;cription was to be alternately followed with proper diluting and cooling drinks. On the third day, the medicine operated &s;atisfactorily; for a prodigious quantity of green or cy&s;tic bile was evacuated. The pul&s;e, however, exhibited a &s;tate of con&s;triction, and the &s;tomach was &s;ick.</P>
<P>Let us now venture a few conjectures on the&s;e unfavourable &s;ymptoms. Among the remedies which we employ, there are many, who&s;e power and efficacy we can under&s;tand and analy&s;e; but there are others al&s;o which may an&s;wer all our
<PB N="56" REF="034311_0064_0FFC3BE142752298">wi&s;hes, without our being able to account for their &s;ucce&s;sful operation. Thus, if in the remo|te&s;t foldings and cavities of our vi&s;cera, there exi&s;t a corrupted fluid which we wi&s;h to evacu|ate, it is obvious that venefection, affecting the whole &s;y&s;tem and di&s;tending the nerves and the ve&s;&s;els, will operate on each di&s;ea&s;ed part; yet how does it happen that a mercurial powder &s;o effectu|ally obtains the &s;ecretion of the hepatic and cy&s;tic bile? This circum&s;tance, as well as that of the &s;ame effect being produced by the regulus of antimo|ny, when taken into the &s;tomach, cannot as yet be explained. In the ca&s;e now under contempla|tion, twelve grains of calomel, mixed with other dra&s;tics, was &s;ufficient to evacuate a great quan|tity of cy&s;tic bile. It was not, therefore, impro|bable, that by a continued action of the mercury another quantity of bile might be forced out and &s;ecreted from the liver to the duodenum and the &s;tomach. It was the acridity of this bile which cau&s;ed the con&s;triction of the pul&s;e, and which &s;ickened the &s;tomach. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances I con&s;idered it &s;afer to effect its evacuation by a vomit than otherwi&s;e; and I con&s;equently order|ed an emetic. It produced the happie&s;t effects; for, at the clo&s;e of the third day, the patient had &s;carcely any inflammatory &s;ymptoms, and en|joyed a vi&s;ible remi&s;&s;ion of fever. His &s;kin ap|peared moi&s;t; and his countenance was more cool and placid. All his &s;en&s;ations were agree|ably
<PB N="57" REF="034311_0065_0FFC3BDEF97AC478">affected by the comforts of a good bed, and a room warmed and purified by a chimney fire.</P>
<P>It &s;hould appear, gentlemen, that our patient is now brought, from the mo&s;t perilous &s;tate to the point of recovery. The <HI>moles movenda</HI> of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, and of the large infarcted ve&s;&s;els; have been relieved, and the contaminated bile evacuated. Thus, therefore, two important in|dications have been timely fulfilled; and the actual &s;tate of the patient appears to be that of the <HI>vis vitae,</HI> which always marks the beginning of the convale&s;cence. But you will remember that the la&s;t indication has not yet been obtained, and that, within a certain &s;pace of time, it mu&s;t be effected either by natural or artificial exertions. This indication has already been de&s;cribed as re|lating to the depuratory cri&s;is of the whole flu|ids, when they have been more or le&s;s contami|nated; and it compri&s;es all the <HI>&s;econdary ones</HI> for the treatment of malignant and bilious remit|tents. It is beyond the power of medicine to abridge the cour&s;es and periods of the&s;e fevers. But, notwith&s;tanding their different &s;tages cannot be &s;o accurately traced as would enable us to form a nomenclature, yet &s;ome general rules have been deduced; and, upon the authority of the&s;e, it mu&s;t be allowed, that the bilious remit|tent, like the <HI>cau&s;os</HI> or <HI>febris ardens,</HI> mu&s;t la&s;t four or &s;even days, and may even be protracted
<PB N="58" REF="034311_0066_0FFC3BDD70408DE8">to nine or fourteen. Exceptions to this march are very &s;carce; and the ca&s;e No. 6, which was perfectly re&s;olved in three days, I never could account for in any other way than the following. By the <HI>primary</HI> effects of the contagion on the bile, the patient did not receive its <HI>&s;econdary</HI> tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion into the blood, and had not con&s;e|quently the elaboration of nature to &s;uffer, but was cured as &s;oon as the evacuations of the he|patic and cy&s;tic bile were obtained.</P>
<P>But, gentlemen, the illne&s;s of my young pa|tient did not end at the point I have la&s;t mention|ed; for I &s;oon di&s;covered another paroxi&s;m of fever. For the relief of this I pre&s;cribed gentle remedies, &s;uch as carminative injections and di|luting draughts; and previous warm bath had been applied to the inferior extremities and ab|domen. You will thus perceive, that I con&s;ider mild operations only as de&s;irable, during the ex|acerbations of the fever, except that bleeding is requi&s;ite when its inflammatory characters are too high. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, I could &s;ee no urg|ing nece&s;&s;ity for vene&s;ection; for the bile had al|ready been evacuated, and the remi&s;&s;ion of the &s;ymptoms and fever had been regular and uni|form. Be&s;ides endeavouring to pre&s;erve the life of his patient, a phy&s;ician &s;hould be careful in the u&s;e of tho&s;e means which, by their frequency, may create other di&s;ea&s;es, or render the convale|&s;cence
<PB N="59" REF="034311_0067_0FFC3BD9AFAE96B8">very long and perilous. On the night of the fourth day, the fever of the patient was &s;o violent, that, in his delirium, he got up and went naked into &s;everal corners of the hou&s;e. How wonderful, gentlemen, are the exertions of Na|ture when &s;he is properly a&s;&s;i&s;ted! As &s;oon as this exacerbation was over, the patient had &s;eve|veral copious di&s;charges of bile; red petechiae were ob&s;erved on his brea&s;t and arms; and his &s;alivary glands being a little affected, he had a &s;alutary and frequent &s;pitting. The cri&s;is pecu|liar to the malady was now beginning to appear. The redne&s;s of the &s;kin began gradually to change to a whiti&s;h hue, which I judged would, at a pro|per time, turn yellow. What were then my ob|&s;ervations; what was I to do; and what had I to expect? The revul&s;ion of the blood from the veins into the arterial &s;y&s;tem was certainly fini&s;h|ed; and the corrupted bile, by which the liver was infarcted, was &s;ecreting and diffu&s;ing partly in the bowels, and partly in the blood. Mercurial dra&s;|tics were &s;till nece&s;&s;ary; and, by their means, I again procured copious evacuations of yellow bile which was probably from the liver. On the fifth day, the yellowne&s;s was vi&s;ible; a quantity of this &s;tagnant bile having mixed with the blood. It was then nece&s;&s;ary to accelerate and &s;timulate the circulation by &s;udorifics and tonics; and the &s;tomach, being languid and exhau&s;ted, &s;ome re&s;torative and nouri&s;hing &s;ub&s;tances were
<PB N="60" REF="034311_0068_0FFC3BD827861A60">to be admini&s;tered. Thus, from the fifth to the &s;ixth day, the patient was a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and enjoyed &s;ome natural &s;leep. His fever had been very moderate and attended with but little delirium. On the &s;ixth, ob&s;erving no further exi&s;ting cau&s;e of irritation, I ordered a mild nitrous cathartic to keep up the motion of the bowels, and to prepare, by natural evacuations, if po&s;&s;ible, the approaching final re&s;olution of the malady. This took place, during the night of the &s;eventh day, by an equal and profu&s;e per&s;piration, by copious urines, containing a thick yellow &s;ediment, and by repeated di&s;charges from the bowels.. I then de&s;ired that the patient &s;hould be put in clean linen and in another bed. I mu&s;t not, however, omit ob&s;erving, that the &s;heets and clothes with which he had been covered during the la&s;t days of his illne&s;s, were &s;potted with a kind of yellow purulent matter, and had a very offen&s;ive &s;mell. This circum&s;tance is always a &s;triking proof of the final depuratory cri&s;is terminating a malig|nant fever, and more peculiarly exhaling the contagious mia&s;mata of the yellow fever.</P>
<P>From this moment, the patient could not, with any probability, experience any further exacer|bations of fever; and he wanted no further a&s;|&s;i&s;tance than &s;uch as is nece&s;&s;ary to convale|&s;cents. He was in this &s;tate during five or &s;ix days, and a gradual nouri&s;hment, with two grains of
<PB N="61" REF="034311_0069_0FFC3BD5E7A5FA88">opium, given at night, were for &s;ome time admini&s;|tered. This remedy is very re&s;torative after acute and dangerous di&s;ea&s;es. It calms the general ir|ritation of the vi&s;cera; it fixes the o&s;cillation of the nerves; it procures repo&s;e and comfort; it gives &s;ome tonic power to the alimentary chan|nel; and, infine, it helps the di&s;per&s;ion of the yellow &s;erum remaining in the cellular mem|branes.</P>
<P>A &s;crutini&s;ing peru&s;al of the preceding ca&s;e, will, perhaps, gentlemen, afford a better idea of my method of treatment of the yellow fever, than any treati&s;e I could give. I &s;hall, therefore, con|clude this &s;ection with the following propo&s;itions.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> The pathology of the yellow fever &s;ug|ge&s;ts three indications to be ob&s;erved in the me|thod of treatment. The fir&s;t is the &s;peedy eva|cuation and renovation of the corrupted and acrib bile; the &s;econd, to counteract the pro|gre&s;s of inflammation and to di&s;cu&s;s the conge&s;|tion of the large blood ve&s;&s;els, which cannot di&s;|charge into the liver; and the la&s;t, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the depuratory cri&s;is of the whole &s;y&s;tem, which is to be effected within a certain &s;pace of time, and by natural or artificial means.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> The calomel is a &s;pecific of unexception|able &s;ucce&s;s, to evacuate the hepatic and cy&s;tic bile; provided its action be directed towards the
<PB N="62" REF="034311_0070_0FFC3BD39C7C3C80">bowels, by being united with other dra&s;tics. As a &s;ialagogue it may be favourable: and the mer|cury, applied externally, cannot be u&s;eful but in the la&s;t indication.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> The fir&s;t indication will be al&s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the u&s;e and action of an anti|monial emetic; but, before this and the calomel could be efficaciou&s;ly admini&s;tered, the &s;y&s;tom mu&s;t be brought to a con&s;iderable relaxation and tem|porary ce&s;&s;ation of the inflammatory &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> Profu&s;e and repeated bleedings are the only &s;ure means of abating the inflammation, and of fulfilling all the views of the &s;econd indica|tion, which occur at the exacerbation of the fe|ver. There may, however, be &s;ome advantage in &s;paring the blood; but, during the three fir&s;t days, not to take enough of it would be fatal.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly,</HI> The la&s;t indication requires all the me|dical rules for the treatment of malignant fevers within a certain &s;pace of time; but the two fir&s;t mu&s;t be completely ob&s;erved within three days; for, in the latter period, the contagious mia&s;ma|ta may already have contaminated all the animal fluids and mortified &s;everal vi&s;cera.</P>

<P>THIS was one of the cautions laid down by the immortal father of the medical art, who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the trea&s;ures both of judgment and experience.
<Q>All that is too much is contra|ry to Nature;</Q>
and even our important di&s;co|veries of a &s;pecific and of remedies for the yellow fever, will become dangerous if we admini&s;ter them without proportion or re&s;traint. I &s;hall, therefore, gentlemen, proceed to con&s;ider a few important cautions in vene&s;ection and the u&s;e of mercury for the cure of the yellow fever, and then enumerate &s;uch other objects as relate merely to the patient.</P>
<P>It is a well authenticated fact, that frequent &s;ucce&s;s has attended profu&s;e blood letting in the yellow fever. If the injudicious and illiberal at|tacks
<PB N="64" REF="034311_0072_0FFC3BCF16EADDF8">that have been levelled again&s;t it during our late calamity, have de&s;troyed the confidence of &s;ome of the patients and their attendants, it has been owing to the force of ridicule which is too apt to &s;educe unreflecting minds. But time and expe|rience lead to truth and will &s;urmount every ob|&s;tacle. When the celebrated Moliere had, by &s;e|veral dramatic pieces, painted the medical pro|fe&s;&s;ion in the mo&s;t ludicrous colours, the public laughed at the ignorance of pretended phy&s;icians. But the re&s;ult was, that a more ju&s;t di&s;crimina|tion was afterwards made between them and practitioners of genuine re&s;pectability. However, the public will doubtle&s;s readily acknowledge that facts and principles will always &s;tand forth again&s;t every &s;arca&s;tic a&s;&s;ailant. To tho&s;e who think that indi&s;criminate bloodletting was recommen|ded as a &s;pecific in the yellow fever, we would remark, that the principles held out by phy&s;ici|ans, ought always to be examined with imparti|ality and attention. We &s;ay, it is true, that, for the cure of the yellow fever, we mu&s;t bleed early and as copiou&s;ly as fifteen or twenty ounces at a time; that, in each exacerbation of fever, during the three fir&s;t days, bleeding ought to be free in proportion to the apparent inflammatory &s;ymptoms or elevation of the pul&s;e; that the &s;tagnation of the bile in the liver and other vi&s;|cera infarcted, &s;u&s;pending the circulation of the blood in the large ve&s;&s;els, ought partly to be
<PB N="65" REF="034311_0073_0FFC3BCCD8C0D290">con&s;idered as an immediate cau&s;e of mortifica|tion, and partly requiring a great depletion of blood; that the power and efficacy of mercu|rial dra&s;tic do&s;es, being always in a ratio to the relaxation of the &s;y&s;tem, it will be previou&s;ly ne|ce&s;&s;ary to relax by bleeding, and this perhaps as often as they are admini&s;tered; that the mea&s;ure of bloodletting has no bounds but that of a vi&s;ible and favourable change, and no terms to its reiteration, but the marked period where the effects of the malady are irrevocably fixe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for death or recovery. After admitting the&s;e ge|neral rules, two cautions ari&s;e from pathological principles, viz. the time of bleeding and the quan|tity of blood to be taken. If vene&s;ection pro|duces &s;uch powerful changes in the equilibrium of the animal fluids, and if it relaxes the &s;olids, we ought not to have recour&s;e to it, without a &s;trict attention to the &s;tage of the malady, to the exacerbation of the fever, and to the formation of certain cri&s;es. 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> During the three fir&s;t days of the fever, this remedy will doubtle&s;s an&s;wer all the afore&s;aid indications and purpo&s;es; but, when the effects of the contagion are diffu&s;ed in the vi&s;cera and blood, as is generally the ca&s;e after the third day, bloodletting may an&s;wer very well for certain &s;econdary &s;ymptoms, but would then be u&s;ele&s;s for primary indications; and even if the patient was likely to recover, &s;uch means as have an enweakening tendency, would only retard
<PB N="66" REF="034311_0074_0FFC3BC921AA4D28">the favourable event. Hence ari&s;es the practical caution of &s;paring blood, if po&s;&s;ible, after the third day. 2<HI>dly,</HI> As the exacerbation of the fever ex|hibits all the extent and degrees of the inflam|matory &s;ymptoms, it affords the be&s;t opportunity of judging of the nece&s;&s;ary quantity of blood to be taken. At this period, al&s;o, the blood-ve&s;&s;els are infarcted or are in a &s;tate of conge&s;tion; while, at any other, nature &s;eems to re&s;t, and it is perhaps better to let her help the patient with|out di&s;turbing the cri&s;es and operations of the fe|ver. Hence ari&s;es the practical method of bleed|ing at the very moment of exacerbation; but &s;el|dom before and never immediately after. For, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, we may retard it, when it is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, and in the &s;econd, we intervert its ef|fects and render them incomplete. 3<HI>ly,</HI> We have already noticed, that the admi&s;&s;ion of the bile into the blood, the hemorrhage, eruptions on the &s;kin, &amp;c. were cri&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e, and that when one or many of them take place, the fate of the patient is decided. If he has not, how|ever, been bled, before the&s;e &s;ymptoms take place, it is &s;eldom in his favour; and if a ca&s;e &s;hould happen, in which nature, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of bloodletting, &s;hould effect the re&s;olu|tion of the di&s;ea&s;e, it mu&s;t be owing to the un|corrupted &s;tate of the whole ma&s;s of forces and fluids. If then, the&s;e happy effects can be a&s;|cribed to &s;uch a &s;tate, we mu&s;t be careful not to
<PB N="67" REF="034311_0075_0FFC3BC793DCD2D8">commit the i&s;&s;ue of a recovery, or create irrepa|rable accidents, by a diminution of the&s;e forces and fluids. Hence ari&s;es another practical caution of &s;paring the blood after the appearance of one or more of the cri&s;es. It would be very difficult and almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to trace all tho&s;e circum|&s;tances, which are to be di&s;covered and deter|mined by accurate attention and judgment. One in&s;tance, however, in the ca&s;e of T. B. above related, may &s;erve to illu&s;trate the caution upon bloodletting. His &s;ituation &s;eemed to require a third bleeding, and but little danger could have re&s;ulted from it. It will be remembered, that he had been copiou&s;ly bled at fir&s;t, while in the country, and that, deprived of any further ad|vice, he remained without medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance till the latter end of the &s;econd day. At this time, he was in the mo&s;t alarming &s;ituation, and I wai|ted anxiou&s;ly for the &s;econd exacerbation, which took place in the night, and indicated a &s;econd copious bleeding. Its effects were &s;o favourable, and it produced &s;o happy a change, that, at the time of the approach of the third exacerbation, I was convinced it would be regular, and not at|tended with too much inflammatory diathe&s;is; for the patient had &s;till continued to evacuate bile. I then left it entirely to the forces of nature. It was indeed violent; but its effects pre&s;en|ted regular cri&s;es as far as medical rules de&s;ignate. Infine, I concluded, that if this la&s;t
<PB N="68" REF="034311_0076_0FFC3BC5F871BCD0">exacerbation could, without bleeding, be atten|ded with many favourable &s;ymptoms, I might continue the treatment without u&s;ing it any fur|ther. I afterwards received the greate&s;t benefit from this re&s;erve; for it rendered the convale|&s;cence of the patient very &s;hort. This generally is the ca&s;e with tho&s;e who lo&s;e but little blood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Lieutand, phy&s;ician of the late king of France, has proved that profu&s;e bleeding cau&s;es &s;uch a relaxation of all the blood ve&s;&s;els, as greatly to enlarge their capacities, which, by admitting more blood than is nece&s;&s;ary, creates all the maladies incident to a plethoric &s;tate. It will, con&s;equently, be of the ut|mo&s;t &s;ervice to our patient to &s;pare as much blood as po&s;&s;ible. The mercurial dra&s;tics &s;hould be given immediately after bloodletting, as they will then produce a more efficacious effect; and, as the exacerbations after the third day till the end of the fever, are al|ways decrea&s;ing, it mu&s;t be concluded, that, admitting the reme|dy indi&s;pen&s;able during the three fir&s;t days, nece&s;&s;ity will hardly be found for more than three or four vene&s;ections.</NOTE>.

<P>The exhibition of the calomel, in the yellow fever, will pre&s;ent to us more important and un|objectionable grounds of caution, when we re|trace the different modes of the operation of this precious medicine, in order to confine its u&s;e to what ab&s;olutely requires it. We have &s;een that, as a dra&s;tic purge, it was particularly adapted to the excretion of the hepatic and cy&s;tic bile. To this &s;triking circum&s;tance, we cannot help a&s;cribing the repeated &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e phy&s;icians who fir&s;t recommended the u&s;e of this medicine. We are
<PB N="69" REF="034311_0077_0FFC3BC3006E2F08">al&s;o acquainted with its effects as a &s;ialogogue or &s;alivating remedy; &s;ince many phy&s;icians have thought that this kind of operation could be pro|duced by it only, and could be depended upon. Infine, the u&s;e of mercury, in the form of oint|ment, has been applied in many ca&s;es of the yellow fever, and I &s;hall therefore, examine whe|ther it will thus an&s;wer &s;ome u&s;eful purpo&s;es or not. From the&s;e preliminaries, gentlemen, I &s;hall derive only one propo&s;ition, for practical caution re&s;pecting the u&s;e of mercury, including all my own rules.</P>
<P><HI>The calomel, or mercurius dulcis, &s;hould never be admini&s;tered as a &s;alivating remedy in the yellow fever. It is &s;ufficient to direct its action towards the bowels by the help of other powerful dra&s;tics. It will a&s;&s;i&s;t the cri&s;is of the &s;uppuration of the paro|tids if it can take place. The external application of mercury will not effect an evacuation of the bile, and could not an&s;wer but for the depuration of the &s;y&s;tem if the patient had not exacerbations of fe|ver; but in this hypothe&s;is the remedy mu&s;t prove u&s;ele&s;s and dangerous.</HI></P>
<P>Several important que&s;tions ari&s;e from the preceding propo&s;ition. What are the objections again&s;t the &s;alivating method? Is the cri&s;is of the &s;welling and &s;uppuration of the parotids differ|ent from common &s;alivation? Can it take place
<PB N="70" REF="034311_0078_0FFC3BC175122E80">in the yellow fever without the action of mercu|ry? If it is a &s;ucce&s;sful cri&s;is, why do we avoid exciting it? And finally, if a mercurial prepa|ration, taken internally, is allowed to be a good &s;pecific, why does another &s;imple mercurial pre|paration, applied externally, prove u&s;ele&s;s or dan|gerous? Let us now re&s;ume each of the&s;e que&s;|tions, and candidly inve&s;tigate them, unattended with a lengthy and &s;cientifical collection of au|thorities, with which I &s;uppo&s;e my medical rea|der well acquainted. In every kind of complaint there is not one of tho&s;e revolutions or admira|ble cri&s;es in the frame, which are excited by the combined action of remedies, with a view of ob|taining a ce&s;&s;ation of the di&s;order, that is not an exact imitation of what the natural and &s;pontane|ous laws would accompli&s;h, if they were not ob|&s;tructed. The be&s;t, therefore, we can do is what nature frequently operates without our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and often before it can even be obtained. Thus, among all the &s;ingular circum&s;tances to be re|marked at the end or re&s;olution of malignant fe|vers, the &s;welling and &s;uppuration of the glands and parotids has been noticed as one of the mo&s;t favourable cri&s;es, and I have already ob&s;erved that Pouppe De&s;portes, in his de&s;cription of the malady of Siam, had particularly noticed its final and &s;ucce&s;sful operation. To his authority I could &s;ubjoin that of many phy&s;iological writers. Ex|perience al&s;o has exhibited to me &s;everal in&s;tan|ces
<PB N="71" REF="034311_0079_0FFC3BBE43ABD1C0">of the mo&s;t perfect and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;uppura|tion of the parotids, in the yellow fever, with|out much mercury or none at all. (Vide ca&s;es No. 8 and 10.) I do not doubt, gentlemen, but to this cri&s;is, which is not uncommon, we are in|debted for the con&s;i&s;tent and bold attempt of the phy&s;icians who fir&s;t di&s;covered the &s;ucce&s;s of ca|lomel in the yellow fever. They did not perhaps notice, that it cured by its dra&s;tic power, and that a &s;ucceeding &s;uppuration of the parotids was rather a &s;pontaneous cri&s;is, than the effect of the remedy. But if this be &s;o, there are others al&s;o which &s;pontaneou&s;ly progno&s;ticate a perfect cure in all malignant fevers, as well as in our epide|mic. The&s;e are yellowne&s;s, profu&s;e evacuations from the bowels, hemorrhages, tran&s;udation of cor|rupted blood from the lips<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular cri&s;es I ever &s;aw; and, as it occurs but &s;eldom to practitioners, I think it de&s;erves de&s;crip|tion. The &s;ubject was a poor man, of about thirty years of age. He was in the third day of his fever, entirely in the hands of na|ture, and de&s;titute of any proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Although he was very ill, the u&s;ual medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance operated &s;o favourably, that I de&s;ired he might not be &s;ent to the ho&s;pital. On the fifth day, &s;ome blood ran from different parts of his lips; where it &s;oon har|dened and thickened &s;o much, that he could hardly received any thing into his mouth. The lea&s;t motion or violence would cau&s;e a new hemorrhage. On the &s;eventh day, the yellowne&s;s appeared much le&s;s than is common; but the &s;ize and weight of tho&s;e black &s;cabs were &s;o great, that they reached the no&s;trils, and ren|dered the re&s;piration very difficult. The patient was in the great|e&s;t torture, and made a hideous appearance. I ordered the lips to be wa&s;hed with &s;ome warm mucilage. A few pieces of &s;cab were &s;oon detached, but new beds formed again though much thinner. They gradually dimini&s;hed during the convale&s;cence, which was otherwi&s;e rapid and regular.</NOTE>, &amp;c. All the&s;e cri&s;es,
<PB N="72" REF="034311_0080_0FFC3BBCAE0B7DA8">which are equally good when they take place at a proper time, appear various in different kinds of malignant fever. Thus, the yellowne&s;s is particularly characteri&s;tic of our fever, and the lymphatic &s;wellings, in the &s;ame manner, de&s;ig|nate the plague, &amp;c. But, if in both di&s;ea&s;es, the &s;uppuration of the parotids could be excited, by art or nature, the one would not be attended with a jaundice, nor the other with a &s;welling; for there is never more than one cri&s;is peculi|arly &s;pontaneous. The mo&s;t convincing proof, however, that the &s;uppuration of the parotids ought to be con&s;idered as a &s;pontaneous cri&s;is in this fever, may be derived from the ob&s;erva|tion which every practitioner mu&s;t have made on the progre&s;s, &s;tages, and &s;pace of time, through which a &s;alivation is commonly artificially ob|tained. Few in&s;tances are found, even among de|licate patients, in which it breaks out in le&s;s than eight days, and it generally takes two or three weeks. As much time is afterwards nece&s;|&s;ary to obtain, by it, a ce&s;&s;ation of the exi&s;ting &s;ymptom or di&s;ea&s;e. Now, it mu&s;t be remem|bered, that five or &s;ix days only embrace all the periods and i&s;&s;ue of the yellow fever. Con&s;e|quently, if a &s;uppuration of the parotids takes
<PB N="73" REF="034311_0081_0FFC3BB981B84EC0">place, it will rather be &s;pontaneous, than be the re&s;ult of a few do&s;es of calomel; for the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e is too rapid to depend upon its &s;alivating effects. But if the cri&s;es of a &s;welling and &s;uppuration of the parotids is to be con&s;ider|ed as a &s;pontaneous re&s;ult, peculiar to one indivi|dual, and not to another; if it be a mere chance to receive it, as well as to be favoured with another as hemorrhage, flux of the bowels, &amp;c. will it be prudent to admini&s;ter the calomel as a &s;alivary medicine only? Will not the &s;afety of &s;o rapid and violent a di&s;order be committed to an un|certain effect? And will not the treatment be ren|dered an ob&s;tacle to &s;uch means as nature em|ploys to get rid of the imminent morbid cau&s;e?</P>
<P>To enforce this argument, we mu&s;t examine what indications, facts, and theories, have united in &s;upport of calomel. This medicine has un|doubtedly a peculiar efficacy in evacuating the bile, and in cleaning the infarcted liver; and I tru&s;t that no &s;y&s;tematic practitioner will deny the truth of this fact. Why then do they prefer an uncertain operation to that which is as ea&s;ily and as well produced in all &s;ubjects? Why would they endanger the i&s;&s;ue of the malady, by fixing the whole effects of the mercury upon the primae viae, in order to confine its action on the &s;aliva|ry glands only, and thus render it u&s;ele&s;s in the evacuation of the <HI>&s;pecific contagion,</HI> at a time when
<PB N="74" REF="034311_0082_0FFC3BB7F5593618">the mo&s;t urging nece&s;&s;ity calls for it? Why would they give time to the poi&s;oned bile to injure its re&s;ervoirs, and then, by pouring into the blood, infect the whole &s;y&s;tem? Why would they believe that the evacuation of that <HI>&s;pecific contagion</HI> can be better effected by means of the &s;alivary glands than by the natural excretory organs, as long as its &s;ources in the vi&s;cera are not emptied? Such, however, would be the effects of adopting exclu|&s;ively the idea of &s;alivation by calomel for the cure of the yellow fever.</P>
<P>In dwelling a little longer, upon a &s;ubject of &s;o much importance, I do not, gentlemen, fear to be tedious; and I tru&s;t I &s;hall be excu&s;ed when I attribute many un&s;ucce&s;sful in&s;tances of our treatment of the yellow fever, by calomel and bleeding, to the neglect of the con&s;iderations I &s;hall now &s;ubmit to your attention. I have alrea|dy ob&s;erved, that when the hepatic and cy&s;tic bile are evacuated, the &s;y&s;tem remained more or le&s;s infected; becau&s;e the large blood ve&s;&s;els, which pour into the liver, and receive its blood again, mu&s;t have wa&s;hed off enough of the con|tagious bile. I al&s;o &s;tated, that to repair &s;uch ef|fects, a general depuratory cri&s;is was afterwards to take place, within a certain &s;pace of time, and by natural or artificial means. As this phy&s;iolo|gical rule cannot be denied, it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged, by every practitioner, that it would be
<PB N="75" REF="034311_0083_0FFC3BB5078C4FE0">impo&s;&s;ible, as well as improper, to excite, in every patient, the &s;ame final and depuratory cri&s;is. They will remember, that, in a woman, it may, perhaps, take place by a di&s;charge from the ute|rus, and in men, by per&s;piration, hemorrhages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I remember &s;eeing, during the late calamity, a publication in one of the new&s;papers of Philadelphia, in which the writer pre|tended to prove the nece&s;&s;ity of bleeding in the yellow fever, by the frequent hemorrhages of the patient. I differ greatly from this opinion, and believe it might occa&s;ion con&s;iderable mi&s;takes in practice. In the highe&s;t turgency of the blood-ve&s;&s;els, the &s;mall or capillary ones, have, according to their &s;ize, as much to re&s;i&s;t as the large&s;t, which are &s;eldom known to bur&s;t, even when the pul&s;e is in the highe&s;t &s;tate of elevation, except in ca&s;es of appo|plexy, when the blood cannot return into the heart. Hemorrhages are always the effect of a le&s;ion or of the morbid &s;tate of the tex|ture of the ve&s;&s;els. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;ea&s;es, they originate from the va&s;|cular &s;y&s;tem; and they never happen during the exacerbations, but on the contrary during the remi&s;&s;ions, and when the pul&s;e has returned to its greate&s;t calm. At this period, the relaxed va&s;cu|lar &s;y&s;tem, pours off a fluid ejected from the circulation, and not re&s;umed in the veins. It is from this cau&s;e that hemorrhages in fevers are con&s;idered as ominous progno&s;tics, according to the time of their appearance.</NOTE>, evacuations from the bowels, &amp;c. The di&s;cove|ry of what will be the tendency of the patient, and by what cri&s;is he will be finally a&s;&s;i&s;ted, re|mains con&s;equently with us. When this is made, we &s;hall be obliged again to acknowledge, that the calomel, when admini&s;tered to &s;alivate, will, in many ca&s;es, counteract the march of the di&s;|ea&s;e; and that it will ob&s;truct every cri&s;is, but that of the mouth. A purge counteracts the &s;a|livation,
<PB N="76" REF="034311_0084_0FFC3BB3457FD640">while the latter has the &s;ame effect upon all that can be obtained by hemorrhages, per&s;|pirations, &amp;c. It follows, therefore, that, if the patient has neither time or a natural tendency to undergo the operation of &s;alivating, this means would be contrary to the cure of the yellow fever.</P>
<P>The practice of exciting a &s;alivation, for the cure of &s;everal di&s;ea&s;es, will better explain its equi|vocal effects in the yellow fever. By it, the morbid cau&s;e is tran&s;ported from any part of the body or from the blood, into the &s;alivary glands, from whence it is in&s;en&s;ibly wa&s;hed out, attended with a mo&s;t offen&s;ive &s;mell; and the mercury &s;ecretes, by the&s;e glands, a great quantity of &s;aliva. Should others give a different explanation of this phenome|non, yet we mu&s;t all agree as to the fact, and this is &s;ufficient. It cannot be denied but that the affection of the mouth varies afterwards very much among different individuals, and although this circum|&s;tance cannot be accounted for, the re&s;ults may be &s;atisfactory and have the de&s;ired effect. There are patients on whom the greate&s;t quantity of mercury has never been able to affect their mouths. Some receive an ea&s;y affection in the &s;ublinguals and maxillary, but their &s;pitting is unattended with a &s;welling of the parotids, and con&s;equently has no critical good effect. The &s;tate of the teeth, their being covered with ear|thy &s;cales, or much decayed, and previous mala|dies
<PB N="77" REF="034311_0085_0FFC3BB10663F0C8">of the gums, may, in many ca&s;es, render the action of the mercury &s;o painful and even dan|gerous, by hemorrhages, that the cour&s;e of the medicine mu&s;t be interrupted, without fulfilling the adopted intention. Infine, the practice of ad|mini&s;tering mercury, without &s;alivation, by the means of certain precautions, recommended by many phy&s;icians as equally &s;ucce&s;sful and &s;afer in the re&s;ults, are con&s;iderations &s;ufficiently pow|erful to make us di&s;approve of the &s;alivating me|thod in a di&s;order &s;o rapid, and the malignancy of which, might be conquered by le&s;s equivocal means.</P>
<P>Re&s;uming my former propo&s;ition, I recom|mend, as an important caution, that calomel &s;hould never be admini&s;tered by it&s;elf nor in the method or proportions intended for &s;alivation; that, on the contrary, it mu&s;t be but about the third part of a dra&s;tic mixture, by the means of which it will immediately be diffu&s;ed into the bowels; and that, if, in &s;pite of jalap, &s;cammo|nea, or gamboge, it is retained too long without operation, an oily cathartic, or &s;ome neutral &s;alts, &s;hould be given to prevent the mercury from a&s;|cending, and to enforce the bilious evacuations, the importance of which has been &s;ufficiently proved. This method leaves always time enough for the cri&s;is of the mouth if it is nece&s;&s;arily in|tended by nature. It helps it &s;ufficiently, and it
<PB N="78" REF="034311_0086_0FFA6B85C1A90C80">even accelerates its appearance, and gives it all the characters that can render it perfect and &s;a|lutary. Such ca&s;es have occurred to me in the proportion of one out of ten<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In practi&s;ing the method of admini&s;tering calomel, in the proportion of a third again&s;t two-thirds of other dra&s;tics, as ja|lap, &s;cammonea, &amp;c. the following has been the re&s;ult of my practice in the wor&s;t ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Out of &s;even patients to whom the calomel was carefully ad|mini&s;tered as a dra&s;tic, I lo&s;t only one.</P>
<P>I had one &s;pontaneous &s;uppuration of the parotids out of ten.</P>

<P>One by eruptions out of twenty.</P>
<P>And, finally, one by tran&s;udation of the blood from the lips out of fifty.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Few ob&s;ervations remain again&s;t the external application of mercurial ointment. Admitting that it tends to the purification of the blood, what will be thought if the original cau&s;e and the foam of contagion are not de&s;troyed? The re&s;ervoirs of the bile are not emptied by mercu|rial <HI>frictions.</HI> This remedy, therefore, cannot an|&s;wer any good purpo&s;e, except after the fir&s;t pe|riod of the di&s;ea&s;e, when previous evacuations have been accompli&s;hed. This hypothe&s;is, how|ever,
<PB N="79" REF="034311_0087_0FFC3BADE1A2D318">would &s;till be liable to con&s;iderable objec|tions, &s;uch as the exacerbations of the fever, and the turgency of the blood-ve&s;&s;els, which never fail to manife&s;t them&s;elves as &s;oon as the mer|cury is admitted into the circulation. The fir&s;t would be con&s;iderably counteracted by mercu|rial frictions, while they are nece&s;&s;ary to termi|nate the malady within a certain &s;pace of time; and the other would become preci&s;ely one of its mo&s;t dangerous &s;ymptoms, and would be renew|ed and &s;ettled before we could have time to op|po&s;e it, or to obtain any deci&s;ive and good re&s;ult. I &s;aw, in the la&s;t prevalence of the fever, a ro|bu&s;t young man, in the fourth day of his &s;ick|ne&s;s, who had been regularly rubbed with mer|curial ointment. The excretory evacuations had been neglected; he had not the lea&s;t affection of the mouth; and he died on the fifth day.</P>
<P>Some practical cautions re&s;pecting emetics al&s;o demand our attention. I have already &s;tated their u&s;efulne&s;s in emptying the &s;tomach and duode|num, when, in the cour&s;e of the fir&s;t period, the&s;e vi&s;cera are &s;ickened, notwith&s;tanding every other application has been &s;ucce&s;sful. If the mercury, in &s;hort, promotes the &s;ecretion of the bile from the liver, this favourable operation is immediate|ly followed by a &s;ickne&s;s of the &s;tomach, and then the emetic is nece&s;&s;ary. (Vide ca&s;e No. 7.) In many in&s;tances, the patients di&s;cover a great
<PB N="80" REF="034311_0088_0FFC3BAB9F74E6F8">aver&s;ion to this remedy, and if they are of a delicate nervous con&s;titution they frequently re|fu&s;e to take it. In &s;uch ca&s;es I employ an equiva|lent remedy, &s;trongly recommended by the inge|nious Mr. Dubois de Rochefort, in his Materia Medica. He calls it <HI>un emetique cathartique en lavage.</HI> One grain of tartar emetic, or one grain and an half at mo&s;t, is to be di&s;&s;olved, with half an ounce, or three drams, of &s;alt of Glaubert, in about two pounds of water. The patient is to drink it by tumblers full every hour. This medi|cine is not nau&s;eous; it &s;eldom excites vomitting; and it is always &s;ure to empty the &s;tomach and bowels downwards. It is a general ob&s;ervation in practice, that the patient &s;hould, in all acute di&s;|orders, be prepared, by various depleting reme|dies, for all the &s;ub&s;equent operations.

I &s;hall not here enquire into the nature and extent of their utility, nor the method of their application.

<P>In order to illu&s;trate the importance of an ear|ly application to phy&s;icians, during the &s;ea&s;on which unfortunately creates all degrees of bilious, remittent, and malignant fevers in the&s;e climates, I &s;hall familiarly relate an in&s;tructive in&s;tance of errors of judgment, in a ca&s;e of apparently com|mon and trifling indi&s;po&s;ition, and of the inutility of medical aid when applied for too late. To|wards the clo&s;e of our late calamity, I was &s;ent for by the wife of an unfortunate hu&s;band.
<PB N="83" REF="034311_0091_0FFC3BA7CB415CE8">From motives of the mo&s;t unequivocal tenderne&s;s and affection, &s;he unhappily deprived him of &s;uch timely aid as would undoubtedly have &s;aved his life. "During four nights &s;he had not left his bed|&s;ide. Per&s;uaded that &s;he knew, by experience, his indi&s;po&s;ition, &s;he continued all this time to give him &s;uch remedies as &s;he thought proper. She re|fu&s;ed at fir&s;t to admit me into his room; for the frequent vi&s;its of phy&s;icians to infected hou&s;es alarmed her very much. She &s;aid that &s;he had been &s;o &s;ecluded from any kind of intercour&s;e with others, that, thank God, the yellow fever had &s;pared every one of her family. She ob&s;er|ved, that &s;he had called me for &s;ome advice re|&s;pecting the indi&s;po&s;ition of her dear hu&s;band; but &s;he was happy to think, that there would not be much occa&s;ion for medical aid; for, &s;ince &s;he had &s;ent her me&s;&s;age, he appeared to be on the point of recovery. He was up, walking about the room; and he intended, next day, to ride out to the country." This la&s;t circum&s;tance, &s;truck me with the apprehen&s;ion that this was the la&s;t day of the life of the patient; and, that I might be better able to judge, I reque&s;ted her to give me an account of his indi&s;po&s;ition from the begin|ning. "He was taken, &s;he replied, with a &s;light fever and puking, owing to a little intemperance on the preceding day; and his head ache and pain in the limbs, &s;he knew very well, proceeded from a violent cold, which &s;he always cured with &s;weat|ing

The patient had, la&s;t night, puked &s;omething of a black colour; but &s;he did not wonder at it, as &s;he had previou&s;ly complied with his wi&s;h of giving him &s;ome coffee and toa&s;|ted bread.

I cannot tell, after &s;uch a recital, which &s;truck me mo&s;t, the innocent confidence of the wife, her un|&s;u&s;pecting ignorance, the irrevocable fate of her hu&s;band, or the painful ta&s;k which devolved upon me, of de&s;troying &s;o many erroneous opinions, and plunging, by one word, the whole family in the mo&s;t unexpected di&s;tre&s;s. My &s;ilence was in|terrupted by the patient, who called us up, ex|pre&s;&s;ing &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s and wi&s;hing to lie down again. His pul&s;e was &s;mall, ten&s;e, and intermit|tent; and a black in&s;tead of a yellow hue was &s;uffu&s;ed all over his body. The confu&s;ion of his look, was highly expre&s;&s;ive of in&s;tant danger; and being &s;uddenly taken with the mo&s;t extreme weakne&s;s, he could hardly an&s;wer to but few of my que&s;tions. His wife was now &s;eized with a&s;to|ni&s;hment; and, taking advantage of the circum|&s;tances of the moment, I retired with her from

<P>The la&s;t &s;ubject of practical caution, gentle|men, that has occurred to me in the treatment of the yellow fever, is &s;till more &s;erious than the preceding ones, and of more certain fatal con&s;e|quences. In other acute di&s;orders, a phy&s;ician may perhaps find out &s;ome means of relief, and calculate by them a &s;ucce&s;sful mode of treatment, notwith&s;tanding the patient may labour under pre|vious complaints of di&s;ea&s;ed vi&s;cera or injured con&s;titution; but in our epidemic there is no &s;uch pro&s;pect, or at lea&s;t it is very faint. During the two periods of its prevalence, I never met with an in&s;tance of recovery from it, when the whole frame had been materially injured by certain cau&s;es. A pulmonic affection, however, when not too far advanced, would not, I believe, readily pre&s;ent an ob&s;tacle to the cure, as I have once &s;een exemplified; becau&s;e the proximate cau&s;e of our fever lies entirely in the bile and alimenta|ry channel. But I &s;hall always de&s;pair, at the fir&s;t

On the dreadful effects of this la&s;t, in the malignant yel|low fever, I &s;hall pre&s;ent you a few important re|flexions; and that they may be carefully contemp|lated by my young readers, is the philanthropic wi&s;h dictated by too many fatal in&s;tances. It has been evidently remarked, that the epidemic acted mo&s;t &s;everely upon young and robu&s;t men, and that its victims were chiefly of that de&s;cription. This is a po&s;itive fact, the elucidation of which will not appear &s;trange, when it is remembered that it is not ea&s;y to get rid of the poi&s;on receiv|ed in the embraces of pro&s;titution; that many methods for its cure are truly deceiving; that &s;ome noble vi&s;cera may, by it, remain e&s;&s;entially di&s;ea&s;ed; and that the blood, which contains its particles, will be &s;ooner and unavoidably conta|minated by another contagion. The mo&s;t fa|vourable &s;ymptoms do not always ju&s;tify the con|fidence either of the patient or phy&s;ician; for we are unacquainted with all the changes and &s;hapes of a malady which has been ju&s;tly termed a Proteus or a Cameleon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide A&s;truc on venereal di&s;ea&s;es.</NOTE>. We are daily taught by experience, that, by the ce&s;&s;ation of one of its &s;ymptoms, we are not to judge of a perfect cure. It
<PB N="87" REF="034311_0095_0FFC3B9ED4F5D458">deceives us and the patient al&s;o; for it often lurks within the body, without diffu&s;ing into the blood, or producing any mark of infection. Since there are external &s;wellings and various &s;orts of tumours which we attribute to the venereal lues, why &s;hould we doubt but that they may exi&s;t in|ternally, or within &s;ome noble glands? How of|ten, indeed, the pro&s;trate gland remains ulcera|ted, &s;welled, and tumefied with exuberances, af|ter the improper cure of a gonorrhoea, by &s;trong a&s;tringents, I leave tho&s;e to determine, who are acquainted with the precious enquiries of two famous &s;urgeons on that &s;ubject, Petit of France, and Hunter of England. In the&s;e ca&s;es it is very ea&s;y to appreciate, without further explana|tion, what will be the effects on the &s;ecretions of the urine, on the functions of the kidneys, and on the bowels. To &s;uch internal and chro|nical cau&s;es, we mu&s;t a&s;cribe the numerous ob|&s;tinate and long complaints, which baffle medical &s;kill until their primitive cau&s;e is cured. Mania, hypocondria, epilep&s;y, and the long li&s;t of ner|vous complaints, may originate from the &s;imple irregularity of &s;ecretion of urine into the kidneys; for a part of that fluid remaining in the blood, mu&s;t afterwards affect the whole, or at lea&s;t a part of the frame. But &s;uch circum&s;tances have a deci|ded effect in acute, malignant, and contagious fe|vers. The violence of the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms is an additional evil to the enweakened vi&s;cera; for
<PB N="88" REF="034311_0096_0FFC3B9BD9540DF8">by it they are immediately brought to the brink of de&s;truction.

General Means to prevent the Generation and In|troduction of the Yellow Fever.</HEAD>
<P>Two contrary opinions have appeared on the origin of the yellow fever, and have been officially tran&s;mitted to the executive, by medi|cal bodies of Philadelphia. An attentive public, who know that truth cannot be contradictory, mu&s;t doubtle&s;s feel deeply concerned; and will regret that, after repeated calamities, no unanimous im|provement &s;hould be made among the learned on &s;o intere&s;ting a &s;ubject. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances it becomes nece&s;&s;ary, that, while mea&s;ures are adopting to prevent its importation, the probability of its dome&s;tic generation &s;hould not be forgot|ten. The public precautions &s;hould not be foun|ded &s;olely on the particular opinions of either p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rty; and experience may hereafter afford us &s;ufficient and &s;uch unexceptionable proof, as will leave room but for one opinion upon the &s;ubject. I do not, therefore, gentlemen, di&s;ap|prove of any mea&s;ures that may be adopted to prevent the imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rtation of the yellow fever; on the contrary you will di&s;cover that the above theory has a &s;en&s;ible advantage over the latter,
<PB N="91" REF="034311_0099_0FFC3B966AE17678">for it al&s;o admits of all the nece&s;&s;ary precautions again&s;t the effects of noxious exhalations from the holds of &s;hips or ve&s;&s;els arriving from tropi|cal countries in the hot &s;ea&s;on of the year. If we do not implicitly believe that this contagious epi|demic is imported from one country to another, like the plague or the lepro&s;y, &s;till we admit that it may po&s;&s;ibly originate on board of &s;hips during a long pa&s;&s;age, which contain animal or vegeta|ble &s;ub&s;tances in a &s;tate of fermentation; that, raging contagiou&s;ly among crews from tropical i&s;lands, when the remains of them come to mix with our citizens, it may &s;pread its infection among them, and chiefly during the hot &s;ea&s;on of the year; and that, infine, when a contagious di&s;temper is known to rage in any part of the world, our intercour&s;e with it &s;hould be cautions and &s;ubject to lawful controul. Thus far, there|fore, we coincide in the mea&s;ures of the implicit believers of local importation. We de&s;ire, how|ever, above every thing they have as yet &s;ugge&s;|ted, to fix the ob&s;ervation of our fellow citizens on the dome&s;tic &s;ources of contagion to which they are expo&s;ed.

It of cour&s;e follows, that to oppo&s;e the po&s;&s;ibility of its importation, and of its breaking from corrupted cargoes, it would be expedient to remove &s;uch &s;hips from our &s;hores as are loaded with colonial produce, at lea&s;t du|ring the months of June, July, Augu&s;t, Septem|ber, and October. The rule for admitting the&s;e articles &s;hould be defined according to their good or corrupted &s;tate, a few days after the &s;hips have been unloaded. No intercour&s;e with their crews &s;hould be permitted during five days af|ter.

<P>Philadelphia, &s;ituated on the we&s;t bank of the Delaware, and on the narrowe&s;t &s;pace between the Schuylkill and that river, may be wholly de|&s;ignated in the form of a parallelogram, the &s;quares of which are inter&s;ected by wide cro&s;s-&s;treets, which rai&s;e very little, in certain points, from the &s;outh to the north, but which are open to all the winds, and to all the emanations of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e &s;urrounding fields, ponds, mar&s;hes, and &s;wamps. The conveniencies of foot ways, their cleanne&s;s, and the uniform practice of the inhabitants in fre|quently wa&s;hing the out&s;ide of their hou&s;es, give to the city a &s;ingular appearance of regularity and neatne&s;s highly admired by foreigners. It contains, however, &s;ome capital defects; and too many unfavourable circum&s;tances concur to in|jure its &s;alubrity. Water-&s;treet, thirty feet wide, extending from the northern liberties to Pine-&s;treet, parallel with the cour&s;e of the Delaware, is in a confined low &s;ituation. Though the whole of its extent, it has but few vacancies, is com|pactly
<PB N="94" REF="034311_0102_0FFC3EA454B2B4C0">built, very di&s;agreeable, and is totally de|prived of back yards on the &s;ide of Frount-&s;treet. The &s;ame is to be ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to Penn-&s;treet. It likewi&s;e runs along the river from Pine to Cedar-&s;treet; and, in the late ca&s;es of epide|mic, both have been particularly marked as the fir&s;t &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e. The main height of the ground on which the city &s;tands, is nearly forty feet above the Delaware. Many &s;treets are, how|ever, lower; and, con&s;equently, the adjacent ground, intended for the continuation of the origi|nal plan, is in many places mar&s;hy.

<P>Our city is &s;upplied with no running waters or fountains, and but few ci&s;terns are to be found in private hou&s;es. Wells only are dug, in di&s;tri|butive number, in different parts of the city and &s;uburbs. A pump is placed in each well, and wa|ter is thus ea&s;ily obtained for all the wants of life. A gutter, formed by the elevation of the foot way, and by the gradual de&s;cent of the &s;treet to each &s;ide, &s;eems &s;ufficient to receive and carry down the dropping waters. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> declivity of the &s;treets, in &s;ome places, however, is worn down; and the waters &s;tagnate, more or le&s;s, in all the gutters.

Even admitting this ob&s;ervation to be true, yet, if dangerous vapours cannot immediately ri&s;e from the grave-yards, by the effect of the heat, they may otherwi&s;e be di&s;engaged, by the hydraulick laws of &s;ubterraneous waters. For, &s;uppo&s;ing a grave-yard in a very elevated part of the city, as that of the Friends, at the corner of Arch and Fourth-&s;treets, which is be&s;ides near five feet above the &s;treet, within a &s;tony enclo|&s;ure, it will be granted that the dead are on a level with many different parts of the city, and in &s;ome ca&s;es even above it. Now, &s;ince it is ac|knowledged that the greate&s;t elevation of the ci|ty from the river is forty feet, and that many of the grave-yards are on the highe&s;t grounds, it will evidently appear, that the inhabitants liv|ing in a lower part of the city, will receive ex|halations from the earth, of moi&s;ture and waters that have been infiltrated through an elliptic plan and through a va&s;t number of dead bodies. This ob&s;ervation will be found to agree with the hy|draulick laws; for, according to them, in &s;atura|ted grounds, evaporation collects the waters by
<PB N="97" REF="034311_0105_0FFC3E9E1F69F248">infiltration from higher &s;urrounding points in the &s;ame manner, that, to obtain water from the the highe&s;t parts, we dig for its evacuation at the lower ones. This explanation, gentlemen, will &s;hew how the evaporations in mo&s;t of the low parts of our city, are rendered noxious by the putrefaction of thou&s;ands of dead bodies, and may be carried from one point to another, by means of the grave-yards being intermixed with our dwellings, be&s;ides their immediate ef|fect in altering the waters collected in our wells.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, we have a more dangerous &s;ource of putrid animal exhalations, which is more &s;en|&s;ibly di&s;covered in thickly inhabited places af|ter the heat, and at the clo&s;e of &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Each dwelling has a privy-hou&s;e, &s;ituated at the farthe&s;t end of the yard; and the hou&s;es on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Front-&s;treet have them in their cellars. The ditches upon which they &s;tand, are dug to a con&s;iderable depth and built round with &s;tones or bricks. Many of them are twenty fee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> deep, but this circum&s;tance removes &s;till further the idea of cleaning them. After many years the fermentation cau&s;es of|fen&s;ive vapours during the &s;ummer; and it is very &s;eldom the ca&s;e that the ditches are clean|ed more than once in ten years, when it is of|ten
<PB N="98" REF="034311_0106_0FFC3E9B9B946CC0">con&s;idered ca&s;ier to fill them with &s;tones, and to dig others. The fact is, gentlemen, that towards the end of the &s;ummer, that is to &s;ay, after the action of the heat has &s;ufficiently ex|cited fermentation, mephitic gas a&s;cends from the ditch. Our inhabitants are &s;o well appri&s;ed of this, that they always provide their little-hou&s;es with a vent hole. This is a proof that the depth of the ditch is not a pre&s;ervative a|gain&s;t its noxious vapours; for the rarefaction and the heat of our atmo&s;phere could rai&s;e them from a much more di&s;tant centre. The ab&s;orption of the within contained fluids is &s;o &s;low, in moi&s;t and impregnated grounds, that they wholly remain and &s;erve to accumulate the ma&s;s of fermentating animal &s;ub&s;tances. If a lighted candle be lowered into one of the&s;e ditches, by means of a line, it will often be put out; and when the temperature of autumn does not oppo&s;e the dilation of the a&s;cending gas, it is plentifully diffu&s;ed round the hou&s;es, yards, and alleys, where it is often &s;en&s;ibly &s;melt, chiefly when the air is calm and &s;ultry.</P>
<P>After the enumeration of &s;o many cau&s;es and dangerous &s;ources of putrid exhalation, will not our minds, gentlemen, be impre&s;&s;ed when the reflection of Dr. Lind, that, "next to infection, the mo&s;t frequent cau&s;e of fevers
<PB N="99" REF="034311_0107_0FFC3E994A9FCD88">is perhaps the offen&s;ive and polluted air in un|healthy places;" and that our calamity, perio|dically breaking out, at a certain &s;ea&s;on of the year, was not merely imported?</P>
<P>There are, in Philadelphia, many other &s;ources of putrid effluvia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There are &s;everal &s;inks in Philadelphia, to receive the waters from the gutters, at tho&s;e points where a declivity can no longer be given to their beds. Two very remarkable ones at the corners of High and Fourth-&s;treets, were, during la&s;t &s;ummer and fall, productive of the mo&s;t offen&s;ive exhalations and became a mere nui&s;ance. It is very probable, that, by &s;ome defect or other, the waters in them were ob|&s;tructed; and I take the liberty to direct my reque&s;t to the proper authorities, to have the&s;e &s;inks examined and repaired. As many cats were &s;tarved, in con&s;equence of the de&s;er|tion of the city, there was, I am per&s;uaded, a quantity of car|rion in them. Called out frequently during the night, I could &s;trongly perceive the &s;mell as far as Arch-&s;treet on one &s;ide, and Che&s;nut on the other. I employed &s;ome hours in follow|ing the current of exhalation, and was at la&s;t &s;atisfied as to its true origin.</P>
<P>There were al&s;o &s;everal &s;inks in Pear-&s;treet, in Che&s;nut-&s;treet, at the corner of Dock and Walnut-&s;treets, and in other parts, the canals of which have been, I believe, de&s;troyed, but the holes left open, and the people of the neighbouring hou&s;es &s;till continue to throw their filth in them. I have been informed, by a very re&s;pectable citizen, that he ob&s;erved, du|ring the two in&s;tances of our calamity, that the&s;e vent-holes of putrefaction had been productive of a great number of death in their neighbourhoods.</P></NOTE>, which perhaps are
<PB N="100" REF="034311_0108_0FFC3E962EB47F48">unavoidable, and are common to all other thickly inhabited places in the world, but which ought to attract the attention of our public authorities; &s;ince they are much more dangerous in a place expo&s;ed to the heat of the tropical countries. For the&s;e, as well as for the preceding ob&s;ervations, I hardly think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, gentlemen, to dwell much upon the direct mea&s;ures that &s;hould be adopted by the citizens at large, again&s;t the different cau&s;es of our epidemic. If they were not kept in a &s;tate of incertitude, with re&s;pect to its real origin, their wi&s;dom and prudence would enable them to make the proper regulations. But alas! tho&s;e who are induced, after &s;ufficient con|templation, to predict that the fever will fre|quently rage again in Philadelphia, know how many opponents there are to this melancholy truth, and have very little hopes of obtaining a majority in favour of their advices. Yet, if I cannot flatter my&s;elf with gaining many pro|&s;elytes to my opinion, I con&s;ider it as a duty and a plea&s;ure to throw my mite of informa|tion and firm belief, into the fluctuating &s;cale of public opinion. Under the influence of this &s;entiment, I a&s;&s;ert, that the only &s;ure and effi|cacious means of pre&s;erving Philadelphia from contagious malignant fevers, will be tho&s;e that are directly calculated to remove or de&s;troy,
<PB N="101" REF="034311_0109_0FFC3E94A76B2408">if po&s;&s;ible, the &s;ources of putrid exhalation from animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances that are contained within our precincts. The&s;e means, gentlemen, are of &s;uch a magnitude, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> neither time or great expence would be able to effect them, if religious prejudices, views of mercantile intere&s;t, and opinions of party &s;pirit, are &s;uffered to thwart their execution. Before I attempt to enumerate them permit me to make a few reflexions more on the chymical principles and re&s;ults of putrid ex|halations.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> In whatever light we con&s;ider the com|ponent parts of vapours and ga&s;&s;es, either ac|cording to the former or new nomenclature of chymi&s;try, this much will be acknowledged, that life is oppo&s;ed to the putrid fermentation of animal or vegetable &s;ub&s;tances; and that, as &s;oon as they are deprived of it, they nece&s;|&s;arily fall into a complete &s;tate of putrefaction, which is more or le&s;s accelerated, according to the quantity of heat or caloric, of air and of water, in which they are immer&s;ed.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> As &s;oon as the putrid fermentation takes place, a new combination ari&s;es of &s;eve|ral &s;ub&s;tances, which have a peculiar tendency to unite to the air by the help of the heat, or
<PB N="102" REF="034311_0110_0FFC3E9198D5F0D0">to the water by their affinity to them; &s;o that both fluids, being con&s;iderably altered in their nature, will pre&s;ent a quite contrary effect to that they would have exhibited at fir&s;t, viz. the very air which was good for life and health, will produce a quite contrary effect, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> Among the different qualities of the &s;ub&s;tances di&s;engaged from animal fermenta|tion, there are two very remarkable and which con&s;titute all the degrees of noxious exh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a|tions. The fir&s;t is their extreme tendency unite with air and water, (<HI>Vide Diction. de Chimie, par Macquer, art.</HI> GAS); and the other is a certain degree of their development, which is impo&s;&s;ible to account for, in which whether in a fluid or &s;olid &s;tate, their imme|diate contact with any living body, &s;uddenly de&s;troys or &s;u&s;pends the phenomenon of life. A traveller found the body of a drowned man that had been wa&s;hed on the &s;hore by the flood. As he perceived no foetor, in examining the corp&s;e, he inadvertantly plunged his finger into a &s;oft and putrified limb. From the finger the mortification was &s;o rapid to the vitals, that he had no time to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and he died. Anatomical di&s;&s;ection has al&s;o proved the truth of this terrible and dangerous &s;tate of pu|trefaction. Its various degrees mu&s;t undoubt|edly
<PB N="103" REF="034311_0111_0FFC3E9010DB3368">breed different kinds of di&s;ea&s;e and con|tagion.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> The&s;e exhalations are, moreover, &s;ub|ject to other laws and phenomena of nature, which &s;ometimes occa&s;ion them to be harmle&s;s when they are mo&s;t dreaded, or very noxious and fatal while they are not perceived or even thought of. Heat, without aqueous particles, rai&s;es them, and winds carry them through immen&s;e regions. They &s;eem vi&s;ibly to be a kind of meteor; their operation on the body is terrible, and they in &s;ome mea&s;ure de&s;troy the vitals without any contagious or poi&s;onous ef|fect. Such are tho&s;e remarkable winds and va|pours, &s;o well known in the de&s;erts of Africa, and which originate in the mountains of Aby&s;|&s;inia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Bruse's Travels through Aby&s;&s;inia,</NOTE>. Heat, al&s;o, may dilate them to &s;uch a degree that they become harmle&s;s. This is the ca&s;e when it puts an end to the plague in the hotte&s;t countries of the earth. Aqueous vapours, without much heat, can di&s;en|gage but little of the&s;e exhalations, and it is then very common to perceive much foe|tor, without receiving any injury from it. Thus people attending the &s;ick, di&s;&s;ecting of dead bodies, butchers, tanners, and all tho&s;e who are frequently among exhalations from animal
<PB N="104" REF="034311_0112_0FFC3E8D07A788A0">fermentation, are not known to be injured at all. Tho&s;e exhalations which are &s;u&s;pended above a corp&s;e, within a metallic or wooden coffin, do not want much heat or moi&s;ture, to become fatal as &s;oon as broken open. A mephi|tic gas then appears &s;imilar to that which we di&s;cover in our chymical experiments. Its ef|fects are &s;udden again&s;t every living body; but it can be almo&s;t de&s;troyed or rendered harm|le&s;s, by aqueous vapours, and may be totally ab&s;orbed by vegetables. This air or exhala|tion occa&s;ioned the death of many citizens of Paris, who, in the month of Augu&s;t, 1792, were in&s;tantly killed by its contact, while they were breaking the tombs, to take away the leaden coffins, for materials of military ammu|nition.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly,</HI> Fevers, produced by exhalations are remarkably various, according to their places, time, and &s;ea&s;on. What a &s;triking difference was there between the elephantia&s;is of Athens, the plague of Mar&s;eilles, the &s;ore-throat of Italy, and the &s;weating &s;ickne&s;s of England? We could hardly find, in the pre&s;ent day, any pathological &s;imilarity among the dreadful epi|demics of Norway and Holland; the anomolous malignant ob&s;erved by Hoffman in Germany, during the years 1727, 1728, and 1729; the in|termittent
<PB N="105" REF="034311_0113_0FFC3E8AB6A72E30">ague of mar&s;hy places; the camp di&s;&s;enteries; the ho&s;pital contagious petechiae; the convul&s;ive malignant related by Dr. Chi&s;|holm, which he thought had been imported from Guinea into the We&s;t-Indies; the <HI>vomito pietro</HI> of the Spaniards in Vera Cruz; and the yellow fever of the tropical countries, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="6">6<HI>thly</HI> and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> The concurrence of rains, &s;torms, and heat, are nece&s;&s;ary to develope noxious exhalations from vegetable and animal fermentation. The conjectures re&s;ulting from attentive ob&s;ervations are, that inten&s;e heat, without wind, after heavy rains and &s;outherly &s;torms, is mo&s;t productive of noxious exhala|tions in places containing materials for vegeta|ble and animal fermentation.</P>
<P>The&s;e elementary laws, re&s;pecting the na|ture and effects of exhalations, I have, gentle|men, endeavoured to pre&s;ent, unaccompanied with any &s;cientifical method, in order that every de&s;cription of my readers might be|come better acquainted with them, and finally apply the following means as the only preven|tives again&s;t the generation of the yellow fe|ver <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The committee of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives of this &s;tate, on the health laws, have, in their report, expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in the following terms.</P>
<P>"Although your committee are decidedly of opinion, af|ter the mo&s;t attentive inve&s;tigation, that the di&s;ea&s;e which ra|vaged this city and its &s;uburbs, in the year 1793 and the late autumn, was of foreign origin, they neverthele&s;s believe that there exi&s;ted at tho&s;e periods a certain condition of the at|mo&s;phere which &s;avoured its propagation, and without which it could not have been tran&s;mitted to any a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ing extent. It being a de&s;ideratum, that &s;uch a &s;tate of air &s;hould be coun|teracted, which affords nouri&s;hment to contagion, they cannot too &s;trongly inculcate the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;upply of pure water to the city, and of the &s;tricte&s;t attention to &s;uch regulations as will keep it and its environs free from putrefactive &s;ub|&s;tances."</P>
<P>I am happy to think that the above <HI>certain condition</HI> of the atmo&s;phere, to which the alarming extent of our di&s;ea&s;e has been a&s;cribed, and which has not been explained by the re|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">, may be fully under&s;tood, by the means of elementary chymical ob&s;ervation; and tho&s;e who are decidedly of opi|nion, that they yellow fever is of foreign origin, &s;hould not for|get that, in this age, there is no certain noxious condition of the atmo&s;phere, but has been &s;ubmitted to the mo&s;t <HI>attentive chymical inve&s;tigation and analy&s;is.</HI> This much, however, may be a&s;&s;erted, that the de&s;ideratum to counteract an unhealthy &s;tate of the air, by rendering it free from putrefaction, per|fectly coincides with our theory, ob&s;ervations, and general propo&s;ed means of preventing the generation of the yellow fever.</P></NOTE>:&mdash;</P>

<P>THIS &s;ection, gentlemen, I would con&s;ider as the lea&s;t u&s;eful of my e&s;&s;ay, if any of my readers expected to find in it &s;ecret receipts or infallible remedies, and if they believed that I thought my advices, joined to tho&s;e of the mo&s;t eminent phy&s;icians, &s;ufficient to render them invulnerable to one of the mo&s;t rapid and fero|cious di&s;orders.

<P>Phy&s;icians and others who fir&s;t &s;u&s;pected the dome&s;tic origin of our fever, advi&s;ed their fel|low citizens to remove to the country. How|ever efficacious this mea&s;ure was to tho&s;e who
<PB N="110" REF="034311_0118_0FFC3E800DFD7390">could afford the expences attending it, what di&s;tre&s;s did it not produce among the labour|ing cla&s;s of our citizens, to the public func|tionaries, and to tho&s;e whom public or private concerns retained at the theatre of the cala|mity! By de&s;ertion, indeed, the la&s;t preva|lence was rendered more afflictive than that of 1793, although it was not &s;o exten&s;ive in its ravages; and it will always be my wi&s;h, that, during &s;uch a period, we may experience le&s;s of that ruinous and unexpected di&s;per&s;ion of our citizens. When this is the ca&s;e, there is no kind of di&s;tre&s;s to which our patients are not expo&s;ed. In&s;tances, likewi&s;e, were known of malignant ca&s;es and of deaths among the fugitives. A mortal infection was thus propa|gated in &s;everal &s;urrounding country places, for how could they e&s;cape the nece&s;&s;ary com|munications and intercour&s;e? In European places expo&s;ed to pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, it is a &s;upreme law, that, during their prevalence, the inhabitants are not &s;uffered to quit their places of abode. Far be it from me to wi&s;h for &s;uch an inho&s;pitable mea&s;ure. It is only mentioned to &s;ugge&s;t, that it is a que&s;tion whether more good than evil would not ari&s;e to the community at large, if, free from terror, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by proper and efficacious mea&s;ures, en|couraged by numerous in&s;tances of pre&s;erva|tion
<PB N="111" REF="034311_0119_0FFC3E7CDD66AC20">in town and recovery among the patients, they could be per&s;uaded to &s;ee the &s;hort period of an epidemic &s;pent, unaccompanied with the tenfold calamities and misfortunes of de&s;er|tion.</P>
<P>However rapid the effects of an exi&s;ting con|tagion may be upon healthy people, we can derive from our &s;tated principles, three powerful mo|tives of confidence and &s;ecurity. The fir&s;t re|&s;ults from the nature and operation of the con|tagion on the bile only; the &s;econd, from the po&s;&s;ible removal of the &s;ick from numerous families, or an ab&s;olute ce&s;&s;ation of intercour&s;e with them; and the la&s;t from efficaciou&s;ly ex|perienced cautions even in ca&s;es of the neare&s;t danger.</P>
<P N="1">I. The yellow fever, we have already &s;aid, is merely a bilious one of the mo&s;t malignant degree. Its operations and &s;ymptoms are wholly upon and from the bile. Our inhabitants are particularly &s;ubject to bilious complaints in a certain &s;ea&s;on of the year, and when the la&s;t are endemics, the former will turn out to be an epidemic of the &s;evere&s;t kind.</P>
<P>We have &s;een al&s;o that bilious and yellow fevers commonly fell upon tho&s;e in whom the
<PB N="112" REF="034311_0120_0FFC3E7A959F6E50">bile was of a thick or vitiated nature, and who, by habitual neglect, intemperance, or other unhealthy mode of living, expo&s;ed that &s;ecre|tion to a &s;tate of &s;tagnancy and corruption. Such &s;imple and rea&s;onable given ob&s;ervations &s;hould help us to fix upon a &s;ucce&s;sful method of diet, of remedies, and of cautions, during the perilous prevalence of the yellow fever. At &s;uch a period, a vegetable diet will be a &s;ure preventive again&s;t animal corruption; and ani|mal food of the lighte&s;t kind, being always &s;ufficient for nece&s;&s;ary nutriment, if preferred to heavy and gro&s;s meats, will not excite &s;o great a fermentation of the animal fluids. Sim|ple tonic drinks, mea&s;ured according to the wanted dige&s;tive power, will pre&s;erve us from tho&s;e inflammatory and heated motions of cir|culation which always attend the face and feelings of drinkers of &s;trong wines and &s;pi|ritous liquors, which is an ob&s;tacle to the for|mation and &s;ecretion of liquid and pure bile. But it may be &s;aid, that &s;uch a plan of diet would not be &s;ufficient, during the exhau&s;ting heat of the weather and the nece&s;&s;ary fatigues of life, and particularly &s;o at a time when the body &s;eems to want more &s;timulating means to rai&s;e the lowne&s;s of our &s;trength and &s;pirits. This, gentlemen, is true, and this feeling is powerful; but we ought not to &s;uffer our ha|bits
<PB N="113" REF="034311_0121_0FFC3E790C6D80D8">or mi&s;information, to make us mi&s;take the proper means. I have been frequently more a|nimated and refre&s;hed by a warm bath, during the heat of &s;ummer, by an airing in the coun|try, or by a cooling medicine, than I could po&s;&s;ibly be by the mo&s;t &s;ucculent cordial. In fact, we may compare our body, charged with &s;o ma|ny &s;pringy actions, to a bow, the ela&s;tic power of which would be lo&s;t if it was &s;tiffened by the effect of a drying fire, but which would be bet|ter pre&s;erved if kept in a &s;oft and moi&s;t tempe|rature. Be&s;ides, when we feel very weak, it is often becau&s;e the vis vitae, elevated to an un|common degree above the point of health, ap|proaches to its end, the &s;ame as when it is too low; and then relaxing means are proper, &s;a|lutary, and &s;ucce&s;sful. It is ob&s;erved that we ne|ver more frequently experience the effects of weakne&s;s, brought on by the heat of our fluids, than in the &s;ummer. At this &s;ea&s;on, we are pe|culiarly expo&s;ed to ob&s;tructions in the alimen|tentary channel, crudities of the &s;tomach, and ce&s;&s;ations of daily evacuations. This la&s;t effect is unavoidable, even among the mo&s;t regular con&s;titutions; but evacuating medicines oppo&s;e to it an infallible power. A puke or a dra&s;tic never fails in removing tho&s;e crudities or ob&s;tructions; and, if they are mercurial or antimonial, they will more properly di&s;cu&s;s
<PB N="114" REF="034311_0122_0FFC3E7769233C18">the re&s;ervoirs of the bile, and renew that ani|mal fluid, the fermentation of which becomes &s;o dangerous. I had frequent opportunities, during the two prevalences of the yellow fe|ver, to give this advice to people, who ap|peared to enjoy a regular degree of health. A &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition, which could hardly call for their attention, at another time, was then a &s;ufficient motive for applying to cautious mea&s;ures. I never he&s;itated, when the &s;ubject could bear it, to pre&s;cribe a puke at fir&s;t, and a mercurial dra&s;tic after. In this manner, and with much &s;urpri&s;e, I timely delivered many of them of a prodigious quantity of unnatural, black corrupted bile, from which a dangerous fit of &s;ickne&s;s would undoubtedly have origina|ted. (Vide ca&s;e No. II.) Yet they afterwards lived healthy, notwith&s;tanding the heat of the &s;ea&s;on and the prevalence of the contagion. It is, in fine, a nece&s;&s;ary caution, repeatedly to have recour&s;e to &s;uch medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for it is acknowledged, both by phy&s;icians and others, that repeated ca&s;es of infection may occur.</P>
<P>Frequent walks and airings, chiefly during the cool moi&s;ture of the morning and evening, taken to &s;ome di&s;tant places from our &s;ultry dwellings, will be another &s;alutary practice.

It al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ts the functions that are the mo&s;t endangered, and frequently breaks the cour&s;e of annual and ac|cidental di&s;ea&s;es. In mo&s;t of the cities of Eu|rope, where the &s;treets are irregular, a long experience has &s;hewn, that the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential cau&s;es of their &s;alubrity are, pure waters and public walks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">and every means, both natural and artificial, has been employed to render the latter delightful.

<P N="2">II. Another motive of &s;ecurity for the citi|zens at large, during the prevalence of a con|tagious epidemic, would be, I have already &s;aid, the removal of the &s;ick, or an ab&s;olute ce&s;&s;ation of intercour&s;e with them. This mea|&s;ure, during the late calamity, was ordered by a proclamation from our governor. He was blamed by many who thought only of the in|conveniences ari&s;ing, in its execution, to the &s;ick, who were reluctant to leave their homes and their cho&s;en attendants; and the frequent in&s;tances of mi&s;taken ca&s;es was another cau&s;e of their di&s;approbation of the mea&s;ure. This oppo&s;ition prevailed to &s;uch a degree, that ma|ny ob&s;tinately remained &s;ecluded in their own hou&s;es, died there, and their bodies were af|terwards &s;ecretly carried to the di&s;tant grave|yard of the Wigwam ho&s;pital. The&s;e inconve|niencies cannot be denied, but the efficacious and vigilant mea&s;ures of authority might at la&s;t conquer them. The idea that they are a violation of the rights of humanity and of per|&s;onal liberty, may be oppo&s;ed by good argu|ment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Public &s;afety, and a care for the health and lives of the community at large, have of|ten commanded &s;till more &s;evere mea&s;ures.

<P>Another argument will enforce the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;training per&s;onal liberty in ca&s;es of contagion. It is the cu&s;tomary right by which the neighbour|ing &s;tates exclude us from the u&s;ual intercour&s;e with them. The time may come, which heaven forbid, when the contagious power of this epi|demic, may &s;ugge&s;t to neighbouring di&s;tricts the nece&s;&s;ity of a temporary &s;eclu&s;ion, and par|ticularly &s;o, if &s;evere regulations are not adop|ted among our&s;elves. Will it then appear in|humane, if we our&s;elves are obliged to forbid any communication with the &s;ick, their hou&s;es, and the &s;treets in which they are &s;ituated? The di&s;tre&s;&s;es of this &s;evere mea&s;ure would, no doubt, be &s;oftened, if &s;everal ho&s;pitals were fit|ted up, and a choice left to the patients of their own attendants. They could be thus &s;up|plied with more private accommodations at their own expence, while the poor and forlorn would be taken into tho&s;e public hou&s;es which have been already &s;ufficiently well regulated and &s;upplied with every nece&s;&s;ary by the vigi|lant
<PB N="118" REF="034311_0126_0FFC3E6D41F075C0">care, and generous donations of our citi|zens, during our pa&s;t calamities. Infine, if the&s;e general mea&s;ures are never adopted, we &s;hould at lea&s;t be cautious to &s;u&s;pend any intercour&s;e with the infected hou&s;es and &s;treets, although it will be mo&s;tly too late when the contagion has been &s;uffered to &s;pread. Patrioti&s;m and candour, both of phy&s;icians and citizens, would &s;oon a&s;certain the pre&s;ence of the &s;courge. The mi&s;takes of an i&s;olated judgment may be obvi|ated by previous appointment of many phy&s;i|cians to vi&s;it and con&s;ult upon each new ca&s;e and patient. During the la&s;t prevalence, the public were cautioned that many deaths were a&s;cribed to the yellow fever, &s;ome weeks be|fore they would believe it; but they &s;oon ac|knowledged that they received proper and timely information, owing to the attention of well known phy&s;icians. This is an unque&s;tion|able re&s;ult from what we have &s;tated of the nature and operation of putrid exhalations, that as &s;oon as their fir&s;t effects are di&s;cover|ed, in the early &s;tage of the &s;ea&s;on, we might think it in our power to be prepared again&s;t &s;ub&s;equently created ca&s;es, and again&s;t the contagion from bodies. The&s;e are known to emit, in ca&s;es of death, almo&s;t none, and to be|come dangerous only in the la&s;t periods of the &s;ickne&s;s when they recover.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="119" REF="034311_0127_0FFC3E6A468747A8">III. There are other mea&s;ures which expe|rience has proved extremely &s;ucce&s;sful for pre&s;erving even tho&s;e who are obliged to re|main in infected places. It has been officially reported to the governor, that, in the ho&s;pitals, during the late prevalence, the contagion had not &s;pread among the attendants. This would be incredible were we not appri&s;ed of the re|&s;erves and cautions that are naturally made u&s;e of, invented, and dictated by nece&s;&s;ity when it becomes the &s;upreme law. The origin of the famous <HI>vinegar of four thieves,</HI> &s;o much recom|mended as a preventive again&s;t the plague, is a proof of that beneficial indu&s;try, and I ne|ver found better or more medical means em|ployed with &s;ucce&s;s, than among tho&s;e who do not he&s;itate to exchange many chances of dan|ger again&s;t a valuable compen&s;ation. Yet all their indu&s;try is a&s;&s;i&s;ted with nothing el&s;e than what is in the power of every one. Re&s;uming, my enquiries, and the effects of their general method, I found three re&s;ults from taking vari|ous medicines and from diet. One is, that they reduced the &s;y&s;tem, and abated, con&s;equently, any di&s;po&s;ition to inflammatory or phlogi&s;tic diathe&s;is; the &s;econd, that they kept them|&s;elves in a continual &s;tate of evacuation, and thus were never &s;ufficiently acted upon by the contagious mia&s;mata; and the la&s;t, that they re|newed
<PB N="120" REF="034311_0128_0FFC3E6805EFA740">the bile and rendered it more pure, more fluid, and of a quite contrary &s;tate to that which con&s;titutes a bilious malignancy. The&s;e three rules or indications are equal to any that the medical art can &s;ugge&s;t and pre|&s;cribe; and, as far as they could be well under|&s;tood by individuals, and an&s;wered to by ea&s;y means, they would, I believe, mo&s;tly render the contagion harmle&s;s to healthy people, and ju&s;tify a very frequent u&s;e of warm baths, pre|vious bleedings, and the occa&s;ional admini&s;tra|tion of pukes and mercurial dra&s;tics, &s;uch as we employ in the treatment of our patients.</P>
<P>Some of my readers would, perhaps, here wi&s;h to be informed, as well as in every other medical work, what peculiar do&s;es, powders, or pills, and the quantity admini&s;tered, &s;hould be particularly employed as preventives again&s;t the yellow fever. I do not wi&s;h to make a &s;ecret of the mo&s;t minute circum&s;tances for the proper u&s;e of bleedings, pukes, and mercurial dra&s;tics, but I have already &s;aid enough upon that &s;ubject. A &s;till more u&s;eful piece of advice &s;hall here be given, viz. that it is not by <HI>&s;aturation</HI> or quan|tity only that medicines are rendered efficaci|ous, nor without tho&s;e proportions and modifi|cation, which the various con&s;titutions of dif|ferent patients require, and of which phy&s;ici|ans
<PB N="121" REF="034311_0129_0FFC3E6633D63F98">can be the only proper judges. I con&s;e|quently prefer that preventive medicines &s;hould always be prepared according to what is requi&s;ite for each con&s;titution and by the previous indi&s;po&s;ition of body. The mo&s;t impo&s;ing name, affixed to a pill or powder, will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> make it better, if given and employed without any nece&s;&s;ary re&s;triction whatever, but would, on the contrary, cover great blunders and mi&s;takes. Such is the ca&s;e of tho&s;e patent medicines, which, in the immen&s;e catalogue of their virtual properties, include all the &s;eries of human infirmities, but which are at la&s;t given up as dangerous or equivocal remedies. To their patrons, however, I am willing to grant, that, if it was po&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain above what point they are variou&s;ly noxious, before any obtained &s;ucce&s;s, and under which propor|tion they would fail or become u&s;ele&s;s, they would not be thought a great nui&s;ance among the credulous, whatever power they may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.</P>
<P>The attendants of the &s;ick &s;hould always be attentive to keep a fire in the patient's room, although the warm weather might render it uncomfortable. This I con&s;ider as a pow|erful mean for purifying and renewing the inclo&s;ed air, which is in&s;tantly ab&s;orbed with
<PB N="122" REF="034311_0130_0FFC3E63D031D408">any morbid exhalation. The phenomenon of fire, cannot take place but by an immen&s;e con|&s;umption of air, and it thus becomes a draw|ing ventilator. This mea&s;ure not only de&s;troys any floating contagion for the benefit of the attendants, but I have ob&s;erved it to be very u&s;eful to the patient, who&s;e body &s;hould not be immer&s;ed in its own infectious emanations, and who cannot yet bear to be expo&s;ed to the variable external temperature. Infine, by the means of fire, a &s;alutary and fragrant &s;team can be immediately procured, in the critical mo|ment of foetid and dangerous evacuations.</P>
<P>Various means have been al&s;o recommended as preventives by expanding round our&s;elves volatile and chymical &s;ub&s;tances to neutrali&s;e, as it were, the putrid mia&s;mata. Although this method is very uncertain, yet much benefit may be obtained when the current of an arti|ficial vapour breaks or alters a contagious one. The&s;e means, however, too often act unfa|vourably towards the con&s;titution, and have a tendency to enweaken the nerves, while it is highly requi&s;ite that the body be kept in the very point of health. Every one knows, in this re&s;pect, the effects of camphor and of mu&s;k. The aromatics have a contrary and better ef|fect, becau&s;e they are equally tonics and anti|&s;ceptics.
<PB N="123" REF="034311_0131_0FFC3E617A3BC6A0">We &s;hould, therefore, con&s;tantly make u&s;e of their e&s;&s;ential oils, of their artificial perfumes, and of the fragrancy of their plants. I have &s;een al&s;o the &s;tronge&s;t vinegar general|ly u&s;ed again&s;t pe&s;tilential emanations, and its ebullition with &s;ugar upon red hot iron, pro|duces an agreeable and &s;alutary vapour.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid upon the &s;ubject of de|&s;troying or wa&s;hing with caution the clothes and beds of the &s;ick. None, I believe, are more infectious than tho&s;e of a recovered patient. I have collected, on that &s;core, the mo&s;t &s;atis|factory proofs, that a patient may be even re|infected in his own bed and clothes; and this is undoubtedly the origin of tho&s;e &s;trange ca&s;es, the &s;tages of which run through a longer cour&s;e, and repeated recoveries and relaxes, which is quite contrary to the known periods of a malig|nant fever. it is perhaps u&s;ele&s;s and even incon|venient frequently to trouble a patient by giving him the comfort of fre&s;h, clean, warm clothes, but it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to do &s;o as &s;oon as a profu&s;e per&s;piration has marked the end or a favourable cri&s;is of the malady. If the care of the infected linen is left entirely to the nur&s;es and &s;ervants, they mu&s;t be directed to fold them immediately, and to throw them into cold water, where
<PB N="124" REF="034311_0132_0FFC3E5E68CE6D28">they &s;hould be kept for twenty-four hours, co|vered with a&s;hes to be filtrated into lie, with which they mu&s;t be wa&s;hed. The &s;ame care &s;hould be extended to the beds. At lea&s;t they &s;hould not be u&s;ed again but after repeated night and morning airings. Infine, the attendants &s;hould be careful to promote in them&s;elves a a con&s;tant &s;pitting, and to avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, &s;wallowing the &s;aliva. But let it be re|membered, that, with the&s;e general cautions, and many more too tedious to be related, at the clo&s;e of the &s;eventh day, the convale&s;cent patient can no longer tran&s;mit any contagion. His recovering &s;tate, is a proof of the purity of his blood. How di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, therefore, would it be, under a fal&s;e idea of danger, &s;till to con|tinue our intercour&s;e with him with re&s;erve and caution, when it is no longer nece&s;&s;ary. He has been already too long obliged to con|&s;ider him&s;elf as an object of terror and dere|liction. To what a perilous de&s;pondency has he not been delivered by fugitive friends and re|lations! To what afflictive &s;olitude has he not been condemned, while excruciated by a devouring poi&s;on! The arm of Providence could alone help him from under the two fold pre&s;&s;ure of his body and of his mind! The for|mer may counteract the laws of life as &s;oon and as irrevocably as the latter! And ye attendants

<P>J. W. upwards of forty-five, was corpulent, &s;anguineo-phlegmatic, robu&s;t, and apt to in|dulge in the u&s;e of &s;piritous liquors. For &s;ome years, he had been &s;ubject, during the winter, to pains in the brea&s;t, and to conge&s;tion of bile in the &s;tomach. He was &s;oon relieved by dilu|ting and depleting remedies; but, after &s;everal relap&s;es, I had &s;ufficient rea&s;on to think his complaint a chronical one, originating from &s;ome &s;erious cau&s;e. He oppo&s;ed any further in|ve&s;tigation, always depending upon a real cure. He was taken, on the 22d of July, of the
<PB N="128" REF="034311_0136_0FFC3E5523ECA3D8">la&s;t &s;ea&s;on, with all the alarming &s;ymptoms of the yellow fever, and was treated accordingly. As his pul&s;e was hectic, in the beginning, I was not &s;urpri&s;ed to find him wor&s;e on the &s;econd and third days. The evacuations were always colliquative and foetid, his urine &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and copious bleeding, could never abate the gene|ral &s;ymptoms. I affirmed, to his friends, that he would die in two days. I neverthele&s;s endea|voured to enquire from his neare&s;t relation in|to &s;uch circum&s;tances as would lead to a di&s;|covery of the real chronical cau&s;e, which was &s;o highly aggravating this acute malady; and it was at la&s;t di&s;covered, that, for nine years pa&s;t, he had been &s;ubject to what was termed, the gravel. Sufficient inductions could im|mediately explain my &s;u&s;picions, although it was too late to remedy a di&s;ea&s;ed vi&s;cera. It was intere&s;ting to a&s;certain the ca&s;e, and I ob|tained leave from the patient to introduce a catheter and a bougie into his bladder.

<P>It would be &s;uperfluous to explain the pri|mordial cau&s;e of the&s;e &s;trictures, of the &s;wel|ling of the pro&s;trate, and the tumour projecting within the bladder.

This patient was more affected by the effect than by the cau&s;e. When the &s;ecretions from the blad|der and kidneys were totally di&s;ordered, the blood retained much of the urine, and cau&s;ed the &s;ecretion in the liver to be more copious and corrupted.

D. was a man of fifty years of age, of a very thin habit, with large and numerous blood ve&s;&s;els; of a merry di&s;po&s;ition; and who had unre&s;ervedly u&s;ed high food and &s;trong li|quors. He was &s;till very cautious, in the month of October, 1793, and continued to live in a country place in the neighbourhood. The com|pany of a friend induced him to come in town, and he was immediately taken. His previous complaints were &s;aid to be a con&s;tant rheumatic affection, in the thighs and hips. He had al&s;o frequently experienced paroxi&s;ms of gravel, and no more could be &s;aid on that re&s;pect. His fever was very high; his face red, lurid, and all his frame agitated. A copious bleeding, nitrous drinks, and mercurial dra&s;tics, were admini&s;tered in the &s;econd day. They afforded but a very &s;hort remi&s;&s;ion. The evacuations
<PB N="131" REF="034311_0139_0FFC3E4EE0583278">contained very little bile; the urine was very clear; and he felt an uncommon pro&s;tration of &s;trength. I had, from the patient him&s;elf, that he did not feel whether he had a &s;tomach and a belly. I conceived him to be under a ve|ry fatal progno&s;is. Two other bleedings were ordered in a &s;hort interval, with more power|ful evacuations, and an emetic. They had not the lea&s;t favourable effects. He continued re&s;t|le&s;s, a&s;leep, and had a violent chill. His de&s;pon|dency grew more alarming. He lo&s;t all feeling. The jaundice came on rapidly, on the third day, tinged with a blacki&s;h hue; and he died on the fourth.</P>

<P>If the fir&s;t mercurial dra&s;tics, admini&s;|tered a little after vene&s;ection and when the exacerbation abates, are unattended with a pro|fu&s;e di&s;charge of green bile, we will proba|bly fail in all the &s;ub&s;equent applications; be|cau&s;e there is not any other combination of re|medies to overcome the increa&s;ing re&s;i&s;tance of the morbid cau&s;e. Pro&s;tration of &s;trength is, al&s;o, a premature &s;ymptom of death, when it appears without previous critical operations. Infine, the &s;econd exacerbation of this patient
<PB N="132" REF="034311_0140_0FFC3E4BC11B3018">came on with a chill, and nothing could be more ominous. Early on the &s;econd day, &s;uch were the certain &s;igns of his death, yet I had drawn a much more po&s;itive progno&s;tic of a fa|tal i&s;&s;ue when I was fir&s;t informed of his pre|vious pains called rhuematic, and of his affec|tion of the gravel. Whatever kind of ob&s;truc|tion may happen, in the urinary pa&s;&s;ages, they are mo&s;tly attended with numb pains in the hips and thighs. The&s;e mo&s;tly prove the exi&s;tence of a di&s;ea&s;ed vicera in the <HI>lumbary</HI> region, which aggravates a malignant fever to death.</P>

<HEAD>CASE&mdash;No. III.</HEAD>
<P>A young gentleman, J. T. of a tender con|&s;titution, &s;anguineo-phlegmatic; of irritable nerves, &s;ober life, thin habit, and &s;ubject to frequent weakne&s;s of the &s;tomach, was &s;eized with a &s;hivering, internal burning heat, retching, &s;pontaneous puking of bile, and the mo&s;t tumultuous fever. Headach, pains in the limbs, with exce&s;&s;ive anxiety of mind and body, had increa&s;ed to an in&s;upportable degree, when I fir&s;t &s;aw him; and nothing better could be done than to open a vein and let out twelve
<PB N="133" REF="034311_0141_0FFC3E4A31FAF7B8">ounces of blood. The u&s;ual mercurial dra&s;tics were given after the exacerbation, in very &s;mall do&s;es, and their operation was very incon|&s;iderable and contained very little bile. The urine appeared turbid and foetid. The &s;econd day offered a very gloomy pro&s;pect for the fu|ture i&s;&s;ue. The countenance and look of the patient were confu&s;ed, although he was beauti|fully red coloured, and I di&s;covered retch|ings and &s;ome convul&s;ions in the mu&s;cles of the arm and a general &s;pa&s;modic &s;tate, with a &s;light pain in the pit of the &s;tomach. His tongue was covered with a thick yellowi&s;h cru&s;t, and his pul&s;e very hard. I thus judged that the &s;mal|le&s;t benefit had not been obtained, and that the ca&s;e was more perilous. With the inten|tion of oppofing the &s;pa&s;ms and irritation, of re|laxing them to the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree, and of procuring afterwards critical evacuations, he was ordered to be put into a &s;emi|warm bath, and bled after it. With the&s;e pre|vious means, it was probable that the opera|tion of an antimonial emetic would be regular. It certainly an&s;wered to profu&s;e evacuation of hepatic bile, but it drew the patient into the mo&s;t alarming faintne&s;s and convul&s;ion. We were then in the third day! I gave up all my hopes. Other remedies, as bli&s;ters, and dra&s;tics, were &s;ub&s;equently admini&s;tered to gratify the &s;oli|tude
<PB N="134" REF="034311_0142_0FFC3E47E82B43A0">of friends; but the amiable youth rapid|ly &s;hewed more dangerous &s;ymptoms. A deep orange colour &s;uffu&s;ed all over his body on the fourth day; &s;ome black, yellowi&s;h, and foetid &s;tools took place, and his delirium in|crea&s;ed to di&s;parity. In the evening, he got up, could walk, and in many other exertions, &s;ur|pri&s;ed the vigilance of his attendants, until he was &s;eized with agonizing pains; he expired early on the fifth day.</P>

<P>This is another of tho&s;e melancholy in|&s;tances in which a &s;uperior power overcomes, all at once, the &s;trength of the body, the &s;kill of the medical art, and the aid of natural exer|tions. In it I never experienced the lea&s;t bene|fit from any kind of application, nor could I di&s;tingui&s;h any thing but the rapid de&s;truction of the whole frame. I could not regret that he had not lo&s;t more blood, &s;ince two copious bleeding had afforded no means of relief. I could not accu&s;e the violent operation of a puke, which in its proportions and circum&s;tances is not known to be of &s;uch a dangerous effect. But as I had been informed that the patient had been previ|ou&s;ly much &s;ubject to &s;ickne&s;s of the &s;tomach,
<PB N="135" REF="034311_0143_0FFC3E45A60185D0">for which he repeatedly applied to medical aid, I more diligently enquired and remained, at la&s;t, &s;atisfied, that he was in the ca&s;e of a di&s;|ea&s;ed vi&s;cera, and this explained why, early in the fir&s;t day, his urine was &s;o highly foetid.</P>

<P>The mo&s;t in&s;idious ca&s;e was that of B. a robu&s;t young man, of twenty-three, brought up to hard labour, of a bilious temperament, of a middling &s;ize and regular habit, &s;trong nerves and hard fibres. The mo&s;t particular care was paid to him, and he went through all the &s;tages of the malady without any very alar|ming &s;ymptom; for he died on the eigthth day, after a &s;hort agony, without any previous pro&s;|tration of &s;trength or a moment of delirium. Of the u&s;ual cri&s;es of the yellow fever, the jaundice only had been marked &s;ince the fifth day. It is true the urine was very rare, but bleedings, mercurial dra&s;tics, and other reme|dies, had all produced vi&s;ible effects, and &s;atis|factory relief. Every night the patient appear|ed to be refre&s;hed with a few hours of &s;leep. If he had &s;ome anxiety, it was rather from
<PB N="136" REF="034311_0144_0FFC3E42A1407B50">his mind than from his body. Sitting upon his bed, conver&s;ing, and directing him&s;elf the preparations of medicine, was his &s;ituation more or le&s;s, until the la&s;t moment of his life, and I confe&s;s that, during four days, he deceived my expectation. My reader will now recollect &s;ome ob&s;ervations made in p. 32, re&s;pecting dangerous &s;ymptoms, which it is &s;o difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h. I have there &s;tated that want of &s;ufficient evacuations of bile, lo&s;s of painful anxieties of the body, an uncommon degree of &s;trength and chills preceding the fever, and mu&s;cular convul&s;ions, were the on|ly remaining but fatal &s;ymptoms in in&s;idious ca&s;es. The&s;e were all the &s;triking &s;igns di&s;tinct|ly marked in this patient; and, in &s;pite of the apparent mildne&s;s of all other &s;ymptoms, they always con&s;tituted an alarming progno&s;is, which the i&s;&s;ue ju&s;tified by a &s;udden death. It was very intere&s;ting to a&s;certain what previous di&s;order in the con&s;titution, or in any vi&s;cera, had aggravated the ca&s;e of this robu&s;t young man; but, if there was any, I could not di&s;co|ver it, and remained &s;atisfied with that general opinion, that de&s;truction of life is more fre|quently cau&s;ed by unob&s;erved violation of natu|ral laws, than by effects that &s;trike our &s;en&s;es and our feelings.</P>

<P>Mr. F. d' E. a foreign gentleman, was taken in the latter end of Augu&s;t. He was upwards of thirty-&s;ix, of a pale complexion, tall and &s;lim in his body, bilious-choleric in his temperament, of great &s;en&s;ibility, and of a &s;edentary life. Recent misfortunes had much undermined a con&s;ti|tution naturally &s;trong. He had lately been &s;ubject to frequent indi&s;po&s;itions of the &s;tomach, and chiefly &s;o fifteen days before his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, during which time he had entirely lo&s;t his ap|petite. Probably he received the infection in the company of a friend who fell a victim, a few days before, and it quickly di&s;turbed the opertion of every function. His fir&s;t and &s;onta|neous pukings of the bile were very con&s;idera|ble, as well as his inflammatory diathe&s;is. He lo&s;t near forty ounces of blood, in le&s;s than twenty-four hours. On the &s;econd day, all eva|cuations had been colliquative, foetid, and without cy&s;tic bile. In the exacerbation of the following night, he complained of an internal burning heat, and his eyes appeared red and
<PB N="138" REF="034311_0146_0FFC3E3EC8B93EF0">inflamed. In vain did I again employ the be&s;t of an antiphlogi&s;tic method; and neither anti|mony or mercury could &s;timulate the re&s;er|voirs of the bile. On the third day no dejec|tion of the mind was remarked; but, on the contrary, an incoherent conver&s;ation, a &s;tu|pid and grim look, and a con&s;tant watch|fulne&s;s prevailed, &s;o that he could not bear the &s;lighte&s;t covering in the way of bed-clothes, and was often indulged in the trial of &s;everal beds, to find a diver&s;ion to the anxieties of his body. At &s;uch a &s;ight we gave way to de&s;pair, and medical pre&s;criptions were but formalities of circum&s;tance! The urine was to|tally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed on the fourth day, a &s;tricture on the brea&s;t &s;ucceeded, with great difficulty of the deglutition, and with an earne&s;t de&s;ire of drinking, he hardly could &s;wallow a few drops of any liquid. The jaundice was diffu&s;ing ra|pidly, leaving pale red &s;pots on the joints. His &s;pontaneous &s;tools were highly foetid, black like foot, and full of white and red flakes, very &s;i|milar to parcels of teguments of the bowels. Never, never, were greater ravages and putre&s;cence &s;een in the human frame, except in the plague<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Yet the pul&s;e was regular. On the forenoon of the fifth day, our unfortunate pa|tient got up and completely dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf. With an uncommon vigour he came down from
<PB N="139" REF="034311_0147_0FFC3E3C5533C3D0">a bed room, into the yard, to &s;it and conver&s;e with a&s;toni&s;hed friends. No longer than half an hour was the delu&s;ion of health and life given to him. Alas! an horrid look a deep yellow colour, and a blacki&s;h hue diffu&s;ed over his face formed a countenance which could no longer deceive a medical ob&s;erver. The motions of his body were now an&s;wered by pains in the abdominalia; his pul&s;e became convul&s;ive; a tumultuous delirium marked his agony; and he died late in the night, when a great quantity of putrid blood bur&s;t and was di&s;charged from the bowels.</P>

<P>That the extremely malignant ca&s;e of this patient had been aggravated by a previ|ous &s;tate of &s;ickne&s;s, is unque&s;tionably true. From the be&s;t te&s;timonies, proofs were derived of &s;ome ob&s;tructions in the liver, or of &s;uch <HI>atrabilious</HI> affections as are frequent among peo|ple of his turn and de&s;cription. When all the animal fluids are vitiated, and of cour&s;e their vital power enweakened, how great mu&s;t be the power of a contagious virus on more corrup|tible juices? This in&s;tance, with &s;uch a princi|ple, would then totally contradict the ob&s;erva|tion
<PB N="140" REF="034311_0148_0FFC3E395F675650">of Dr. Hoffman, upon tho&s;e who labour un|der hypochondriacal complaints, whom he thinks are very rarely &s;eized with epidemic or contagi|ous di&s;ea&s;es, or even with the plague it&s;elf. (<HI>Hoff|man's Practice of Medicine, chap.</HI> vi. <HI>art.</HI> HYP.) If &s;uch an effect was ever ob&s;erved to be true, it was &s;urely owing to the u&s;e of tho&s;e medicines to which &s;uch patients have con&s;tantly re|cour&s;e to relieve them&s;elves. As they promote at lea&s;t &s;everal evacuations, they are, more or le&s;s, preventives again&s;t the ab&s;orption of dangerous mia&s;mata. Never were the charac|ters and &s;ymptoms of the yellow fever more &s;trikingly marked, except in the black vomit, which did not take place. But the black matter was plentifully di&s;charged from the bowels. It excoriated them and no doubt it infu&s;ed it&s;elf into the abdominalia. The renewal of vigour, which &s;o peculiarly and in&s;idiou&s;ly &s;ucceeds in the very la&s;t &s;tage of the yellow fever, was extraordinary in this &s;ubject and equal to the violence of all other &s;ymptoms. At &s;uch a de|gree of the yellow fever, its medical inve&s;tiga|tion would not leave room to the lea&s;t &s;ucce&s;s|ful application. Its turbulent and rapid cour&s;e could not be &s;u&s;pended by human aid; but let us tru&s;t to a more con&s;oling opinion, which numerous facts will bring now to the mo&s;t in|controvertible light.</P>

<P>A young man, of about twenty-five, of a florid countenance, plethoric habit, of a labo|rious and irregular life, was &s;eized with a vio|lent fit of epilep&s;y in the &s;treet. He was taken up and carried to his bed in that &s;tate of &s;tupor which accompanies &s;uch paroxi&s;ins. His pul&s;e was depre&s;&s;ed and intermittent; but, as &s;oon as he was copiou&s;ly bled, he vomited a great quantity of yellow bile, and an exacer|bation of high fever immediately came on, which cau&s;ed another bleeding to be pre&s;cri|bed, with an antimonial emetic, a few hours after. It did not produce the lea&s;t motion, although he had been bled twice, which I a&s;cri|bed to the highe&s;t degree of &s;pa&s;modic and in|flammatory diathe&s;is. In fact, his tongue and face were yet of a red fiery colour and his &s;en&s;ibility was not yet re&s;tored. I feared that an immediate bleeding could not bring any further relaxation, nor procure evacuations of the bile, and that I &s;hould &s;oon loo&s;e my patient. In this perilous &s;ituation. I could tru&s;t only to na|ture. The orifice of the bleeding was examined
<PB N="142" REF="034311_0150_0FFC3E3595E18060">and covered with a grea&s;ed lint, and the ban|dage was relaxed with the view of procuring, du|ring the night, a &s;pontaneous di&s;charge of blood, le&s;t the next exacerbation &s;hould be kept up too high, and leave again a tonic re-action. NO in&s;tructions were left to the attendants, for fear of dangerous mi&s;apprehen&s;ions. Nitrous and copious injections were ordered for every two hours, and a do&s;e of mercurial dra&s;tic pills was given before the fever, and the &s;ame after it. All that had been fore&s;een and wi&s;hed for happen|ed. The fever &s;oon became &s;o turbulent on the delirious patient, that the blood bur&s;ted out from the orifice which had been prepared, and continued to run to more than fourteen ounces, and until the patient was deluged with it. The fever than abated with a relaxation; as the ab|domen had been refre&s;hed by many injections, the cri&s;is happened to be more complete. The former emetic, and the mercurial pills, opera|ted all at once, and they cau&s;ed, in every way, prodigious di&s;charges of dark green bile, which, by its acrimony, excoriated the &s;phincters of the fundament. Early the next day, I &s;aw the patient in this favourable &s;tate. He felt extreme|ly weak, but his pul&s;e, and his &s;kin were good.

<P>It has been frequently &s;een, during the two la&s;t prevalences of the yellow fever in Phila|delphia, that the breaking of the malady was marked by an epileptical fit, as it often happens in the &s;mall pox and &s;everal other ca&s;es; for, in whatever pathology epilep&s;y is under&s;tood, it is admitted that it may originate from &s;trong &s;pa&s;ms in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines. That the effect or action of a highly malignant contagion can at fir&s;t be entirely directed on the nervous &s;y&s;|tem, is likewi&s;e beyond any doubt. With the&s;e previous hints, and with the certainty that the patient had never been &s;ubject to that complaint, nor particularly to any other, the circum&s;tance alone of the prevailing epidemic, ju&s;tified an immediate treatment for the yellow fever. The continuation of the inflammatory &s;ymptoms af|ter two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive bleedings, and the ineffica|cy of an antimonial emetic, evinced what has been already &s;tated of the impo&s;&s;ibility of de|livering the body of the contaminated bile, or of the &s;pecific contagion, le&s;t an artificial or na|tural relaxation is timely brought on. The fact
<PB N="144" REF="034311_0152_0FFC3E304B3366B0">al&s;o proved, that I ought not to have he&s;itated for a third bleeding, in the fir&s;t day, although two preceding ones proved inefficacious; but I yet que&s;tion whether the effect of the latter had been &s;o well applied as the &s;ponta|neous bleeding, the mea&s;ure of which I left to the force of the next exacerbation. Be it as it may, the profu&s;e di&s;charge of dark green bile, was as &s;udden as the re&s;i&s;tance had appear|ed ob&s;tinate.

<PB N="145" REF="034311_0153_0FFC3E2EC269B8B8">another rea&s;on &s;trikes us when we con&s;ider that the i&s;&s;ue of the malady mu&s;t, nece&s;&s;arily, depend very much upon the effect or quantity of the &s;pecific contagion that has been diffu&s;ed from the bile into the blood.

<P>H. L. an aged woman, of a lively di&s;po&s;ition, active body, and indu&s;trious life, and remarka|bly &s;pent thirty years of her life in the mo&s;t perfect health. In attending the &s;ick, who had recovered, me took the infection. Although &s;he had all the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms and puked much, &s;he thought but little of her ca&s;e. She had her&s;elf bled copiou&s;ly, applied a bli&s;ter to her brea&s;t, and hardly permitted her&s;elf to be under me|dical direction. I &s;aw her late in the evening of the &s;econd day, full of courage and &s;pirits; but, as during the remi&s;&s;ion of the fever, her pul&s;e was hard and ten&s;e, and as &s;he was in an unnatural agitation, her ca&s;e was, at lea&s;t ve|ry &s;erious. The epi&s;pa&s;tic pla&s;ter was imme|diately taken of. Diluting drinks, and carmina|tive and nitrous injections were ordered, with mercurial dra&s;tics in pill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at different times. All the&s;e remedies an&s;wered very well, and produced copious evacuations of green bile. On the fourth day, the pul&s;e was yet a little convul&s;ive, and the exacerbation brought on a delirium. Thinking it not very nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="147" REF="034311_0155_0FFC3E289F10A300">relax the &s;y&s;tem, by means of bleeding, for fear of counteracting too much the organic &s;trength of an aged body, I gave a cathartico|emetic, with previous dilutings. One grain of antimoniated tartar, di&s;&s;olved with an ounce of &s;alt of glaubert, in a quart of water, a half a pint of which was to be taken every two hours, cau&s;ed little retchings, but produced a prodigious evacuation of yellow, green, brown, and clammy matters. The re&s;ultion of the di&s;or|der was pre&s;umed, and &s;ome opium was ad|mini&s;tered. Yet, on the &s;ixth day, we were threatened with a melancholic di&s;appointment.

<P>A. M. upwards of forty-five, full of juices, of a plethoric temperament and &s;trong con&s;ti|tution,
<PB N="149" REF="034311_0157_0FFC3E257484AFD8">which had been a little impaired by a deep wound received in the brea&s;t, took the yellow fever, as many people did, by keeping a good tonic and uncautious life in a di&s;tant country place, and then coming occa&s;ionally into town, and expo&s;ing them&s;elves to our fultry and impure atmo&s;phere. Two copious bleedings, a warm bathing, nitrous injections, diluting drinks, cathartico-emetics, and mer|curial dra&s;tics, procured &s;ufficient evacautions of bile, and nothing altered the regularity of the exacerbations. On the fourth day, a con&s;i|derable eruption of &s;mall red petechiae broke out, almo&s;t all over the body, and the patient informed me of a violent pain felt in the paro|tid glands. A cool &s;weat diffu&s;ed all over his head, and he was in a great febrile anxiety. Fore&s;eeing a &s;alutary cri&s;is from the mouth, I rendered the dra&s;tics more mercurial and &s;afe|ly waited for the re&s;ult. The &s;welling of the parotids rapidly came on. It broke out on the &s;e|venth day with an in&s;upportable &s;tench and the mo&s;t profu&s;e &s;alivation. The patient could not &s;peak, and large ulcers on the gums and fauces, rendered his deglutition very difficult. It was a plea&s;ing pro&s;pect that this cri&s;is would throw off the contagious matter from the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es and happily terminate the yellow fever without any further nece&s;&s;ary application; but
<PB N="150" REF="034311_0158_0FFC3E230D5D6EB8">the inflammation of the mouth grew &s;o alarming that it threatened with danger of another kind, whil&s;t the patient could not &s;wallow any nou|ri&s;hment, and as the internal ero&s;ions gave way to frequent &s;mall haemorrhages. Such an irritat|ing cau&s;e excited a &s;ymptomatic fever, attended with extreme anxiety of the mind and body. The infection from the &s;alivary glands was &s;o great that it was in&s;upportably &s;melt, even at a great di&s;tance from the patient, and in &s;pite of an ardent chimney fire. It was indeed recei|ved by many per&s;ons; and upwards of two gallons of &s;aliva was one day evacuated. Care was taken to relieve the gums, by cleaning the teeth and &s;crap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> out &s;everal thick &s;cales. Gen|tle anti&s;ceptic and a&s;tringent emul&s;ions were u&s;ed in the way of frequent gargari&s;m. To the ab&s;olute ce&s;&s;ation of nouri&s;hment I &s;ub&s;ti|tuted injections, with the liquor of boiled beef and mutton. It was, in fine, but at the tenth day after the &s;alivation, and the &s;ixteenth of confinement, that the patient began to recover from his mi&s;ery and from the yellow fever.</P>

Yet, agreeably to the intention of evacuating the bile, it had been all preci|pitated downwards, by the power of other dra&s;tics, and after very particular ob&s;ervation; &s;o that nothing or very little of that &s;pecific medicine could remain in the <HI>primae viae,</HI> to pro|mote &s;uch a &s;alivation in a man of &s;trong con|&s;titution. It is true, that as &s;oon as its approach was perceived and determined, more mercury was u&s;ed; but always with the caution to direct its effects towards the bowels. It thus remain|ed to be concluded, that the cri&s;is was altoge|ther &s;pontaneous, and &s;uch as may &s;ucceed in every malignant fever, and once out of ten ca&s;es in the yellow fever.</P>
<P>A remarkable circum&s;tance al&s;o fixes our attention in this &s;ubject. Whatever means of re&s;olution we have &s;een terminating the yellow fever, I do not remember of a &s;ingle in&s;tance without jaundice, except when the &s;welling and &s;uppuration of the parotids have been &s;pontaneous. If the morbid bile, thrown into the blood, con&s;titutes the regular duration of the malignant di&s;order, within a certain &s;pace of time, with the vi&s;ible effect of jaundice, it is a fact, that, before this morbid fluid could
<PB N="152" REF="034311_0160_0FFC3E1DA81C47B0">be confined in the la&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the circula|tion over the &s;kin, it may be determined by ad|mirable laws, but almo&s;t unknown to us, to fix it&s;elf within the &s;alivary glands, from where it will poured off, like a torrent, in a more diluted &s;tate. This happy effect will, then, &s;up|pre&s;s the jaundice and evince the nece&s;&s;ity of a cri&s;is, to help the patient in getting rid of &s;o great a quantity of noxious and morbid fluids. The above ca&s;e, with one of the following, will al&s;o &s;ugge&s;t further cautions to the atten|dants; for the infectious matter poured off by &s;alivation appeared to be more inten&s;e, and of a more penetrating malignancy than is com|monly produced in other &s;ecretions. The operator who had cleaned the teeth of this patient, was immediately taken with an hor|rid pain in the arm, and an eruption on it of a gangrenous nature, of which I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter. As long as the ptyal&s;m is kept up, the en&s;uing di&s;charges, which in the&s;e ca&s;es are purulent, and form a &s;ediment, &s;hould be received in ve&s;&s;els prepared for the purpo&s;e, and half filled up with lime or any other ab|&s;orbant earth.

<P>M. S. a gentleman upwards of forty, cor|pulent, robu&s;t, and healthful, lately from the European continent, prone to a &s;edentary life, but regularly addicted to a whole&s;ome and light diet, was taken during the fever of 1793. Unacquainted with all the fatal circum&s;tances of the prevailing epidemic, he applied to &s;ome
<PB N="156" REF="034311_0164_0FFC3E146782FD80">&s;imple evacuating remedies, until his &s;tate grew very alarming, towards the end of the &s;econd day. At this moment, a friend who &s;lept in the &s;ame room with him, and who had been ne|glected during four days of &s;ickne&s;s, was dy|ing. All the&s;e circum&s;tances threw him into dreadful convul&s;ive motions. A vein being opened, the convul&s;ions increa&s;ed, and never cea&s;ed but by the means of an antimonial eme|tic, the operation of which produced much good and gave &s;ome regularity to the cour&s;e of the malady. At the fir&s;t appearance of an exacerbation of fever, having propo&s;ed blood letting, the patient, who never was bled be|fore this attack of &s;ickne&s;s, and to whom the la&s;t bleeding had not appeared beneficial, utter|ly refu&s;ed to comply with this pre&s;cription, and &s;imple depleting remedies only were u&s;ed.</P>

<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that medical theory had but little participation to this unexpected cure. Moreover, this was one of tho&s;e memo|rable in&s;tances, and not uncommon indeed, in which particular laws and &s;ymptoms being un|ob&s;erved, we are e&s;pecially deceived in our progno&s;tics and mi&s;taken in our fears. It is to be lamented that, in &s;uch ca&s;es, the medical art is not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of more deci&s;ive rules than tho&s;e which are commonly ob&s;erved; for there is no fatal progno&s;tic, but we may find, although very &s;eldom, its exception for a con|trary i&s;&s;ue, and no favourable admitted &s;ymp|toms but were al&s;o &s;ucceeded by unexpected death. No doubt, this limitation of human knowledge devoted, more than once, victims to a fatal or premature dereliction, and rai&s;ed op|probious reproaches again&s;t the medical &s;cience;
<PB N="158" REF="034311_0166_0FFC3E108C5A6A20">yet rea&s;on and experience will unite to ju&s;tify human errors and ignorance, as long as we will be &s;urrounded by my&s;terious laws in nature.

With this ju&s;t confidence, practitioners in phy|&s;ic will never think that ta&s;k &s;uperfluous devol|ved to them of attaining, by one way or ano|ther, to that philo&s;ophical &s;tone of their profe&s;|&s;ion, THE ART OF CERTAIN PROGNOSTICS. Its elements, it is true, are perhaps as exten&s;ive as all the cau&s;es concurring for the phenomenon of life, and as much as the innumerable com|binations that may counteract it; but let us indulge the con&s;oling hope, that that analy&s;is, which has &s;ubmitted to our &s;peculations, as many exten&s;ive laws of nature, from the rol|ling planets and lightenings above, down to the ambient fluids which are unperceived by our &s;en&s;es; the &s;ame analogies, I &s;ay, might &s;ome|times, and with a far more glorious &s;ucce&s;s, em|brace all the laws of nature, round the bed of a patient.

<P>By what expre&s;&s;ion or power, in the coun|tenance of a patient, without any reference to &s;ymptoms and circum&s;tances, are we deter|mined?

If we can point out frequent in&s;tances where our judgment has been &s;trikingly de|cided by means, thoroughly unaccountable, would it be impo&s;&s;ible to analy&s;e them, or to direct our attention to many others? Let us rather fear, that, in fact, we are not &s;ufficiently acquainted with the laws or effects of life and health. Our phy&s;iological methods &s;eem to have included a &s;eries of mo&s;t &s;triking circum&s;tances; and a veil has been thrown upon any thing apparently unattainable by the multitude.

After long ob&s;ervations we have known, the degree of our animal heat, when in a &s;tate of health, and of its variations nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ulting from ce&s;&s;ation of health, we could not exactly apply a &s;ingle one to any malady whatever.

This poi&s;on is, mo&s;t commonly, inhaled through the mouth, in re&s;piration, whence it diffu&s;es through the alimentary channel, di&s;turbs, at fir&s;t, all its functions, and contaminates all its fluids. The ab&s;orbent lymphatic ve&s;&s;els take their ri&s;e from the &s;kin, which may determine &s;uch a &s;ingular ca&s;e, whenever they come in contact with the infection, &s;o immediately as I did when my hand and fingers were intro|duced into the mouth of the patient. Whether the &s;ub&s;equent violent illne&s;s was &s;ymptomatic of the affection of the arm, or whether I had likewi&s;e received the infection in the bile, I am not able to de|termine; though, to me, the latter &s;eems mo&s;t
<PB N="166" REF="034311_0174_0FFC3E0062BA6950">probable, as the pain remained invariably on the &s;ame point, and never extended further up the <HI>os humeri</HI>; and yet, the morbid cau&s;e in the vi&s;cera was proved both by the illne&s;s and the evacuations. The cutaneous teguments which really mortified and formed a pretty thick e&s;char, preceded by <HI>phlictenes,</HI> were my demon&s;trative proofs of the virulence of a poi|&s;on which had on the &s;kin as much power as a a burn, when &s;econded by natural exertions, and emollient poultices, it exuded out|wardly. This in&s;tance will, above all, ju&s;tify my above theories and ob&s;ervations on the greater danger of infection from recovering patients: the more contagious mia&s;mata they throw off, the more certain is their recovery.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WOULD, perhaps, de&s;erve the re|proach of having a&s;&s;umed too great and bold a confidence, if I now &s;hould omit earne&s;tly to &s;olicit your indulgence and that of the public
<PB N="167" REF="034311_0175_0FFC3DFE20D1AC20">The &s;ubject I have treated, requires undoubted|ly longer inve&s;tigations and many more of tho&s;e qualifications which are acce&s;&s;ary to a writer. It is true, the language to which I was obliged to entru&s;t my ob&s;ervations, which never was that of my youth nor of habitude, could not be but a rugged and difficult road, where I ought to have feared to entangle my reader. To &s;uch a con&s;ideration, I had &s;urely &s;acrificed my emulation and my attempt, had I not been much more impre&s;&s;ed upon with the duty of joining what I could of my views to all tho&s;e from which the whole nation expect to derive &s;ome relief again&s;t &s;o great a calamity. Truth could never be attained, if di&s;cu&s;&s;ions from various &s;ides and opinions were not alike in&s;ti|tuted by free and liberal communications. The public claims, as it were, that every one &s;hould be li&s;tened to who thinks that he can contribute to the common welfare. It is of no importance if the learned are divided among them&s;elves, it always is and always will be &s;o, until the truth comes out. There are be|&s;ides principles or opinions which are not to be exclu&s;ively for the learned, whatever may be their conte&s;t and &s;y&s;tems. On the con|trary, if the&s;e opinions are good and &s;afe, they &s;pread and propagate among the people at large, becau&s;e there is much rea&s;on and good
<PB N="168" REF="034311_0176_0FFC3DFBD236A0D0">&s;en&s;e, and no party &s;pirit among the people. This is the cau&s;e why it has happened &s;o of|ten that the public have adopted &s;ound and definitive opinions, while the learned had not yet &s;ettled their own variances. J. James Rou&s;&s;eau reports, that a pea&s;ant of Sile&s;ia had the honour of &s;ettling a great and &s;erious &s;cientifical conte&s;t among the learned in Ger|many, who could not agree, or explain, in the &s;ame way, how a child could be born with a golden tooth!! He fir&s;t thought it nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h the fact, and this he took the trouble upon him&s;elf to do, which he proved to be a fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>Far be it from me, gentlemen, by relating this fact, to throw out any allu&s;ion again&s;t phy|&s;icians of this city, with whom, I am not &s;o happy as to agree in opinion, on &s;everal of the above &s;ubjects; it will be &s;ufficient, perhaps, to declare that I profe&s;s the greate&s;t re&s;pect for many of them; but there are many in&s;tances to prove, that, in matters of fact and rea&s;on, the tribunal of the public opinion will, at la&s;t, be the be&s;t judge. It was thus in Mar&s;eillies in the year 1720. While the plague was rapidly &s;preading and raging, phy&s;icians and &s;urgeons publicly declared, that the prevailing di&s;ea&s;e was not the plague, nor even contagious; and
<PB N="169" REF="034311_0177_0FFC3DF8DB67B770">the famous Dr. A&s;truc had to contend again&s;t all of them, until the fact and the public pro|claimed the plague. Unfortunately, Philadel|phia will be expo&s;ed to the dreadful experience of more facts, and then the public will decide again&s;t all the alledged authorities and &s;y&s;tems. Thus to the public, as a fellow citizen, I thought it my duty, to fulfil this ta&s;k, and to you, gentlemen, as a phy&s;ician, to pre&s;ent my in|ve&s;tigations and experience. Be&s;ides, if every man be indebted to the country and commu|nity to which he choo&s;es to belong, it is my peculiar &s;atisfaction in being enabled to pay this tribute of gratitude to the citzens of Phi|ladelphia. On the&s;e motives, therefore, I ground my claim for the indulgence I &s;olicit for this publication; and, however imperfect it may appear, in the extent, di&s;cernment, and foreign dre&s;s of my ob&s;ervations, if, among the po&s;&s;ible &s;arca&s;ms of critici&s;m, no kind of merit would be be&s;towed on my work, &s;till it will remain as a proof of labour and philanthro|phy; the one is the virtue of a citizen, and the other the character of a phy&s;ician.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been without reference to anotomical or phy&s;iological di&s;cu&s;&s;ions that I have explain|ed the proximate cau&s;e of &s;everal &s;ymptoms and of the jaundice in the yellow fever, by the immediate pa&s;&s;age of the infected bile into the blood from the <HI>pori biliarii</HI> into the vena cava, or at la&s;t by the &s;imple and immediate ab&s;orp|tion of the bile into the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, which exi&s;t in that vi&s;cera as numerous as in many others, when it is &s;topped or ob&s;tructed in its excretory ducts. I was led to that indifference by contemplating that each theory re&s;uming the &s;ame re&s;ult of the admi&s;&s;ion of the bile in all our fluids, it was unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate by what proce&s;s it had taken place. Another ar|gument al&s;o &s;truck me in this acute di&s;order, as well as in many others, in which the jaun|dice is frequently an attending &s;ymptoms or a cri&s;is, although I have not mentioned it in any of the above reflections. Each of our &s;ecre|tions have more than one object of nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="171" REF="034311_0179_0FFA6B97140E2BA8">operation to fulfil for the animal economy. Thus it can be &s;aid, that the &s;imple per&s;piration of the &s;kin, while evacuating a &s;uperfluous fluid, wa&s;hes and opens the pores. The &s;ecretion of urine not only filtrates and reduces the blood to its proper degree of fluidity, but it is a ve|hicle intended to carry off any heterogenous &s;ub&s;tance admitted into it. The bile, prepared in the liver, be&s;ides being a nece&s;&s;ary liquor in the dige&s;tion, will be the means of di&s;charg|ing from the blood tho&s;e elementary &s;ub&s;tances which were created and added to it by the <HI>chyli|fication.</HI> But, if the bile originally received its component parts from the blood, we mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e that as &s;oon as its &s;ecretion is interrupted, the blood will retain all tho&s;e component parts; they will then gradually increa&s;e to &s;uch a quantity that they will be by another law emit|ted in the rece&s;&s;es of the circulation, and there form the jaundice. Therefore, in any theory we may admit three origins of <HI>icterus</HI>; one by the infu&s;ion of the bile already formed, and poured from its excretory ducts into the la&s;t ramifications of the vena cava; another by the ab&s;orbing lymphatic ve&s;&s;els; and a la&s;t, by the biliary component parts retained and re|maining in the blood whenever that &s;ecretion cannot take place. Other circum&s;tances en|force the po&s;&s;ibility of this la&s;t means of jaun|dice,
<PB N="172" REF="034311_0180_0FFA6B9B595E79F0">when we con&s;ider how many cau&s;es may retard the circulation of the blood in the vena portarum, in con&s;equence of &s;ome inflammation or morbid action within the ab|domen, where are &s;ituated all the branches that form its trunk. It is al&s;o admitted, that, in warm countries, the powers of circulation are much enweakened, by which means the large ve&s;&s;els may be di&s;tended, and the bile not &s;uf|ficiently renewed or diluted. Hence ari&s;e bili|ous di&s;orders and bilious evacuations, &amp;c. Such are the general grounds by which I ever thought that &s;everal &s;ymptoms as well as the jaundice in the yellow fever, might equally be under&s;tood in any of the above theories; but, I have &s;ince had the opportunity of con&s;ider|ing a very &s;olid objection again&s;t a pre&s;umed cau&s;e of the jaundice in the yellow fever, ad|mitting that, by ob&s;ervation and &s;atisfactory experiments, it has been proved, that, in ca&s;e of &s;toppage or ob&s;truction, the bile is &s;ooner, ea&s;ier, and even immediately re&s;umed by the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, in&s;tead of the veins. This ab&s;orption, it is &s;aid, cannot originate but with a &s;toppage of the bile in its excretory ducts, or with an ob&s;truction in the liver; yet neither are found by di&s;&s;ection or &s;ymptoms, in ca&s;es of the yellow fever. Its jaundice, therefore, con&s;titutes no &s;imilarity with any other kind
<PB N="173" REF="034311_0181_0FFA6B9D095684A8">of remittent fever or bilious di&s;order; and it is yet a problematic &s;ubject and a <HI>morbus &s;ui generis.</HI> This objection, I mu&s;t own, came to me from a re&s;pectable quarter, and is connected with &s;o many other authorities of facts and opinions, that it indi&s;pen&s;ably demanded a &s;e|rious con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject, in order ei|ther to correct my pointed errors, or to ba|lance the argument by &s;atisfactory rea&s;ons. In the mean time, to my medical reader it will obviou&s;ly appear, that, my only motive for this controver&s;y, is from a con&s;i&s;tency and adhe|rence to the chief opinions of the &s;ubject upon which I have treated. Thus it will be &s;tated,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> as a general view, that the for|mation of jaundice in any ca&s;e of the only ce&s;|&s;ation of proper &s;ecretion of bile, acknow|ledges &s;o many probable cau&s;es, different from any &s;ort of ob&s;truction in the liver, that it could not be confined to the theory of the ab|&s;orption of lymphatic ve&s;&s;els. We &s;ee the po&s;|&s;ibility of an inflammatory and morbid action in the abdomen from the inte&s;tines or the &s;to|mach, and from the diaphragm, immediately di&s;tending or ob&s;tructing the blood in the nu|merous branches of the vena porta, and &s;u&s;pending the circulation in that large ve&s;&s;el, more probably &s;o when we con&s;ider
<PB N="174" REF="034311_0182_0FFA6BCAE2466DE8">that this heavy column of blood mu&s;t be a&s;&s;i&s;ted in its cour&s;e, by all the &s;urrounding motions and vibrations. Now, it will always be &s;afe to conclude, that, if the blood does not &s;ecrete in the liver, and particularly &s;o in acute fe|vers, the principal character of which is a di&s;|turbed circulation, it will keep the bilious com|ponent matter, which it &s;hould lo&s;e, in the liver, and from that mu&s;t ari&s;e an accidental <HI>icterus.</HI> But it is objected, that, even in this ca&s;e, bile &s;hould be left in the blood, as it finds its elements in the liver. I deny that however, and very confidently, until it &s;hall be proved that water could be obtained without <HI>oxygen</HI> or <HI>hydrogen;</HI> or that in any of our glands there is an inexhau&s;tible quantity of the component parts of <HI>oils, acids, &s;alts, water,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>Secondly,</HI> The po&s;&s;ible and immediate infu|&s;ion of the bile from the <HI>pori biliarii</HI> into the minute&s;t ramifications of veins and arteries, is by no means improbable or impo&s;&s;ible, although it is granted that their lymphatic branches (as they appear to be) do not belong to the ab&s;or|bent &s;y&s;tem; for injections have been made, with &s;ucce&s;s, from the <HI>hepatic dact</HI> into the <HI>ve|na cava and vena porta.</HI> But nothing could bet|ter prove, this immediate infu&s;ion of bile into the blood, than frequent ca&s;es of &s;udden
<PB N="175" REF="034311_0183_0FFC3DF5A58898C8">jaundice, by a wound on the head, by too great haemorrhages and profu&s;e bleedings, by a fit of pa&s;&s;ion or anger, and al&s;o by the effect of &s;trong and acrid medicines. It occurs ve|ry often al&s;o in practice, among ordinary and quite contrary ca&s;es to any kind of <HI>hepatitis,</HI> when we find, chiefly towards the end, the eyes of our patients very yellow. This is a cer|tain degree of jaundice; yet it could not take place in con&s;equence of ob&s;tructions, nor by the minute proce&s;s of all the windings of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some anatomi&s;ts contend that nothing is more rapid in the circulation, than the ab&s;orption of the lacteal ve&s;&s;els and lymphatic veins. This I grant; but what will be &s;aid if the fluid expo&s;ed to ab&s;urption becomes thick and tough?</NOTE>. The bile has, therefore, been immediately &s;queezed and poured into blood ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Were the ab&s;orbent power of the lymphatic veins the only means and cau&s;e of jaundice, it could not certainly proceed but by &s;uch &s;toppages and ob&s;tructions as after a while would force and open the valves of the mouth of the &s;aid lymphatic veins; for, in any other &s;tate, the ab&s;orption of the bile could not be affected, as is proved by our u&s;ual &s;tate of health. But we &s;ee the contrary in the yellow fever; no previous &s;ymptoms
<PB N="176" REF="034311_0184_0FFC3DF12354DC60">induced us to &s;uppo&s;e the formation of an ob|&s;truction. Spontaneous and profu&s;e evacua|tions of bile, and a great quantity of it acrid, always diffu&s;ed all along the alimentary chan|nel, &s;eems to prove, that the u&s;ual excretory ducts are opened, and that the only quality of the bile is altered. Let us, then, turn the ar|gument in another manner. There is no ob|&s;truction of the liver nor &s;toppage of the bile in the yellow fever, yet the jaundice regular|ly takes place; this mu&s;t, therefore, proceed from &s;ome other po&s;&s;ible means of jaundice.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Is there no other &s;tate in the con|glomerate glands, but that of ob&s;truction, that can di&s;turb the &s;ecretions and then expo&s;e their fluids to the effects of the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem? Are they not &s;ubject al&s;o to a quite contrary &s;tate, to that of <HI>atrophy</HI>? Although we cannot preci&s;ely account for their mechan|ical functions, mu&s;t we not &s;uppo&s;e, that, what we call an ob&s;truction, when we &s;ee a hard exuberance, or feel a heavy &s;welling in &s;ome parts, that this &s;tate has been preceded by &s;eve|ral degrees of conge&s;tion and <HI>infarction</HI> which con&s;iderably di&s;tended the va&s;cular, villous, or <HI>parenchimatous</HI> &s;ub&s;tances, and, of cour&s;e, much better favoured the tran&s;udaton of certain fluids within the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem. It is not
<PB N="177" REF="034311_0185_0FFC3DEF9B2B23A0">indeed when we feel an ob&s;truction in the li|ver, or a &s;kirrus, or any other unnatural al|teration, that we &s;hould fear that other ope|ration of the lymphatic veins; becau&s;e in this &s;tate, various fluids have no longer any circu|lation nor connection among them&s;elves; but on the contrary, this ab&s;orption has more probably taken place when the ob&s;truction was forming, and when the fluids were yet &s;ufficiently liquid in their circulation. It is not, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary, to have any vi&s;ible ob&s;truction in the liver or &s;toppage in the ex|cretory ducts of the bile, to have a &s;ub&s;equent jaundice; this without the former happens in the yellow fever, and it is often &s;een without ob&s;tructions, nor &s;kirrus in &s;everal in&s;tances. It may then have originated &s;olely from the enthickening of the bile in the <HI>pori billiarii,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Let us never confine our&s;elves with|in narrower bounds, than tho&s;e which belong to the admirable laws of nature. Such a large and important vi&s;cera as the liver mu&s;t have more than one means to di&s;charge the bile which it cannot empty. That of ab&s;orption only would be eventually interrupted or incon&s;idera|ble. The blood may re&s;ume it, to a certain quantity and pour it into the kidneys, or into any other &s;ecretion, as known facts have frequent|ly proved. I al&s;o, readily believe, that the
<PB N="178" REF="034311_0186_0FFC3DEE080DE7A8" MS="y">lacteal ve&s;&s;els may take it from the inte&s;tines, when there is nothing in them but bile, and di&s;charge it into the <HI>thoracic</HI> duct, along with the lymphatic veins. I hope, therefore, that the above argument, the ground of which I had le&s;s the intention to remove than to explain, leaves principles enough with &s;ufficient means to the above theory on the yellow fever, and to all the &s;ub&s;equent opinions.</P>
<P>A famous doctrine has been introduced into the medical world, and it is yet vigorou&s;ly &s;up|ported and even improve by numerous par|tizans. We may call it the doctrine of direct and indirect debility, or the &s;timulating &s;y&s;|tem. The &s;upporters of it &s;ay, that it has &s;uc|ceeded to the imperfect doctrine of &s;pa&s;ms and con&s;trictions, the &s;ame as this latter had exploded the old and more imperfect one of vi&s;cidity and lentor. It &s;eems that unfor|tunately that by tho&s;e methods of definition, modern and ancient di&s;coveries are equally marked either with exclu&s;ive advantages or with reproachfull defects. Thus the ungra|cious abu&s;e of words finally will divide lear|ned men, as it evidently created many heretics, and &s;ectaries during pa&s;t ages of chri&s;tendom. Yet whatever may be the inflexible dogma|ti&s;m of tho&s;e who mi&s;take true learning, by prai&s;ing only one doctrine, who will de|ny
<PB N="179" REF="034311_0187_0FFC3DEBC9588C30">but every judicious phy&s;ician con&s;iders it as his duty to examine all doctrines, and all methods, with an impartial and unbia&s;&s;ed mind to call to his aid all the good re&s;ults from ob|&s;ervations and principles. It was with the motive of avoiding the abu&s;e of words and definition that I introduced only the name of Dr. Brown in my note, p. 29, the author of the doctrine abovementioned; although I ought not to have omitted to ob&s;erve that the actual profe&s;&s;or of the in&s;titutes of medicine, was not preci&s;ely &s;ubordinate to the Brownonian &s;y&s;|tem; &s;ince, on the contrary, he has improved on it, by his excellent views on <HI>morbid excite|ment</HI> on <HI>the preternatural and convul&s;ive actions of the blood ve&s;&s;els,</HI> on the inequality in fevers, of <HI>excitement and excitability,</HI> and on the nece&s;|&s;ity of ab&s;tracting what we &s;hould call in other words, &s;pa&s;ms, irritation, inflammation, &amp;c. and, in one word, &s;ugge&s;ting the relaxation without which no &s;olutary cri&s;is are ever ob|tained.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, in page 14, that as
<Q>we have not any publication, collectively, from that body (the college of phy&s;icians) that could exhibit more, and &s;tronger arguments than merely their opinion of its importation, I &s;up|po&s;e that is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ay any thing either for or again&s;t the opinion.</Q>
This might be deemed a material inaccuracy
<PB N="180" REF="034311_0188_0FFC3DE8CE880050">if I &s;hould not add a nece&s;&s;ary explanation. That body, has, in &s;everal circum&s;tances, publi&s;hed the authentic facts, by which it has appeared that the di&s;order has been impor|ted from foreign countries. The reader will re|member, that I have not drawn the lea&s;t con|trover&s;y from any of the facts concern|ing the importation of the fever nor of of the means which have been alledged to have &s;pread it. Their authenticity and mo&s;t &s;tri|king circum&s;tances never could weaken the contrary belief, which implies the eventual generation of the fever on board of &s;hips from tropical countries, and as it is contagious, we do not deny that an infected &s;eaman might, of cour&s;e, communicate it to his attendants. If a whole crew al&s;o or a part of it, came from a known infected place to another of very hot temperature, they &s;urely may be dan|gerous. The&s;e chances are acknowledged or granted; but, to &s;uch chances we will not give up a matter of principles, of analogy, and an opinion, the arguments of which, in the con&s;titution of the air, are even employ|ed by the opponent believers. Therefore, if the facts proving the importation to others, prove to me nothing el&s;e than the generation of the yellow fever on board of &s;hips, it will not be improper to conclude, that with only &s;uch arguments one &s;ide has nothing &s;tronger than merely their opinion.</P>
