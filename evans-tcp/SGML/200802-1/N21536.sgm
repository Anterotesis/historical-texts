<P>LONG have you been my <HI>fathers</HI> and lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> my attentive <HI>pre|ceptors,</HI> in the intere&s;ting &s;cience of medicine. You ju&s;tly hold on me, therefore, a twofold claim for the twofold duty of a pupil and a &s;on. In re&s;pectful acknowledge|ment of this undeniable claim, I now &s;tep forward and thus publicly &s;olicit your acceptance of the <HI>fir&s;t fruits</HI> of that medical education, which you your&s;elves were plea&s;ed

<P>Avowedly to &s;olicit an exten&s;ion of your immediate patronage and protection to the following tran&s;|lation, would be to offer you an indignity little &s;hort of actual in|&s;ult. Such a &s;olicitation would fal&s;ely repre&s;ent you as men un|willing to become the &s;pontaneous guardians and friends of &s;ilent, una&s;&s;uming truth and merit, but &s;tanding with open arms for the reception even of intru&s;ive error it&s;elf, when u&s;hered to your notice by a brazen front and a blanditious tongue.</P>

by the applauding voice of the learned and the ingenious in almo&s;t every part of the globe to which phy&s;ical &s;cience has hitherto found its way.

<HEAD>Preface by the Tran&s;lator.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT a fa&s;hionable letter of in|troduction is to its bearer, a fa&s;hionable pre|face is to the literary performance which it openly announces to the world. The former procures, for the mo&s;t part, admi&s;&s;ion, and, at lea&s;t, a dinner; the latter mo&s;t commonly an attentive peru&s;al. For their future conti|nuance, however, in favour and e&s;teem, both the vi&s;itant and the volume mu&s;t depend on &s;omething more &s;ub&s;tantial, and of more un|equivocal utility, than either the light eti|quette of a letter, or the &s;pecious propo&s;als of a recommendatory preface.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="028310_0008_0FD89637BA9D6EA0">The reader is reque&s;ted to view the pre|&s;ent prefatory addre&s;s as a mere peace-offering, made by the tran&s;lator to ancient and invete|rate cu&s;tom, and not as a &s;olemn appeal to the public de&s;igned to enhance either the <HI>merit</HI> of the following <HI>performance,</HI> or the <HI>uprightne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>motives</HI> which led to its execution. For with regard to the <HI>merit</HI> of the work, I flatter my&s;elf that no character of literature and ta|lents will ever re&s;ign his right of judging for him&s;elf; and as to the <HI>motives</HI> by which I was induced to engage in its tran&s;lation, they are indeed at pre&s;ent nothing better than ab|&s;olute non-entities, and will in no way effect its utility to man.</P>
<P>The want of a new and complete &s;y&s;tem of phy&s;iology has been long and very &s;en&s;i|bly experienced and regretted by all medical &s;tudents on this &s;ide the Atlantic. As to my&s;elf, I am &s;ure I was led mo&s;t devoutly to
<PB N="xi" REF="028310_0009_0FD8963951C15D48">
regret &s;uch a want, throughout every &s;tage of my medical &s;tudies. In order to acquire a knowledge of the improvements which had lately taken place in this important branch of phy&s;ical &s;cience, I was obliged to range with an infinitude of labour and attention, through daily accumulating volumes, which it was &s;ometimes extremely difficult to pro|cure. This difficulty was augmented even to impo&s;&s;ibility it&s;elf with tho&s;e unfor|tunately living out of the &s;phere of public libraries.</P>
<P>The mutilated abridgment of Haller's phy&s;iology, publi&s;hed in the Engli&s;h lan|guage, is (to u&s;e a common mode of expre&s;|&s;ion) certainly nothing more than a <HI>bare apo|logy</HI> for a &s;y&s;tem. It is imperfect, erro|neous, and, in many places, to me wholly unintelligible. In &s;ome parts, therefore, it no doubt inculcates truth, in others implants

the &s;eeds of error, and in other places again leaves the young mind at liberty to indulge it&s;elf in all the wildne&s;s and revelry of con|jecture.</P>
<P>For the&s;e deficiencies and faults. I am &s;ure that at lea&s;t &s;ome compen&s;ation is made, and &s;ome degree of remedy provided in the fol|lowing &s;heets, which I am about to u&s;her forth to the world.

<HEAD>&sect; 1.</HEAD>
<P>IN the living human body, the healthy functions of which con&s;titute the exclu&s;ive object of the &s;cience of Phy&s;iology, there occur three things worthy of our immediate attention and regard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In an ancient volume commonly ranked among the wri|tings of Hippocrates, <HI>Epidemic.</HI> VI. Sect. 8. &sect; 19, we find the following remarkable clau&s;e:
<Q>Quae continent corpora, aut intus continentur, aut in nobis cum impetu moventur contemplanda &s;unt.</Q>
This celebrated clau&s;e furni&s;hed Abr. Kaau Boerhaave with the fir&s;t hints and &s;ugge&s;tions on the &s;ubject of his ine&s;timable work entitled,
<Q>Impetum faciens dictum Hippocrati per corpus con&s;entiens.</Q>
L. B. 1745-8.</NOTE>; namely,</P>
<P>The <HI>Solids,</HI> or parts containing;</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="028310_0016_0FD896453B4BAC18">The <HI>Fluids,</HI> or parts contained within the &s;olids;</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, the <HI>Vital Energies,</HI> which in the con&s;ideration of the &s;cience of phy&s;iology, con&s;ti|tute the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and important object of our regard. It is in con&s;equence of the&s;e energies that the &s;olids are rendered alive to the impul&s;e of the fluids, endued with a power to propel the &s;ame, and al&s;o to perform a variety of other motions. It mu&s;t however be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e energies are not incommunicably excluded even from &s;ome of the fluids them&s;elves: on the whole, they ap|pear to con&s;titute the e&s;&s;ence or &s;upreme charac|teri&s;tic of an organi&s;ed body.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>&sect; 2.</HEAD>
<P>But although the&s;e three <HI>objects</HI> have been with propriety con&s;idered as di&s;tinct from each other, and may therefore be &s;eparately enumerated on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, they are notwith&s;tanding in the living body, which is alone the exclu&s;ive &s;ub|ject of phy&s;iology, &s;o intimately connected toge|ther, that it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to form even a conception of one without at the &s;ame time em|bracing the others.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="028310_0017_0FD89646B8CDA810">The mo&s;t pure and limpid fluids of our body abound with animal earth: on the other hand, though our &s;olids may appear to us completely de&s;titute of liquid matter, yet, be&s;ides the circum|&s;tance of their originating from the fluids as their <HI>matrix</HI> or primary &s;ource, they contain in their compo&s;ition an evident quantity of moi&s;ture&punc; la&s;tly, if we be not deceived, it is certainly true that there exi&s;ts &s;carcely a fibril in the living body which does not po&s;&s;e&s;s, in a higher or lower degree, a vital energy inherent in it&s;elf.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>&sect; 3.</HEAD>
<P>We now proceed to treat of each of tho&s;e three objects &s;eparately and in order: and fir &s;t of the fluids; as con&s;tituting by far the <HI>greate&s;t,</HI> and what may be emphatically called the <HI>fir&s;t-born</HI> part of our bodies.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; 4.</HEAD>
<P>All the different fluids of our body, may with propriety be thrown into three leading cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="028310_0018_0FD896485079B278">The&s;e are, I. The <HI>Crude</HI> or una&s;&s;imili&s;ed fluid, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of the chyle contained in the primae viae, and de&s;tined for conver&s;ion into blood; to which may al&s;o be added, <HI>that fluid</HI> received by ab&s;orption from the external &s;uperficies of the body, and conveyed to the &s;ame receptacle with the former.</P>
<P N="2">II. The blood it&s;elf;</P>
<P>And La&s;tly, the <HI>&s;ecreted fluid,</HI> or that formed from the volume of blood by the animal proce&s;s, called &s;ecretion: the fluids prepared by this pro|ce&s;s are de&s;tined, &s;ome of them, to be retained in our body, to &s;erve further purpo&s;es in the animal economy; and others, to be eliminated from our &s;y&s;tem, as wholly excrementitious.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>&sect; 5.</HEAD>
<P>Of the fir&s;t and third of tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es we will &s;peak on a future occa&s;ion, when we come to treat of chylification, and of &s;ecretion, together with the other functions to which tho&s;e fluids are re&s;pec|tively related. Let us now proceed to the con&s;i|deration of the blood, that mo&s;t important, that primary, and truly vital liquid, which may with the greate&s;t propriety be called, the living fountain of all the other fluids; as being that <HI>into</HI> which the crude fluid is converted; and <HI>from</HI> which all
<PB N="5" REF="028310_0019_0FD8964A94CC3030">
the &s;ecreted fluids derive their origin; and which (a few parts of the body excepted, &s;uch as the epidermis, the <HI>tunica arachnoidea,</HI> the amnion, the vitreous &s;ub&s;tance, or enamel, of the teeth, &amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.) fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ws uniformly through every even the mo&s;t minute and fine &s;pan parts of the inexplicable texture of our &s;y&s;tem.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>&sect; 6.</HEAD>
<P>The blood is a liquid <HI>&s;ui generis,</HI> of a well known colour, more or le&s;s inten&s;e: it is glutin|ous and warm to the touch: the formation of this liquid has hitherto been ranked among the <HI>arcana</HI> of nature, as it has never been &s;ucce&s;sfully imi|tated by any proce&s;s of art.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>&sect; 7.</HEAD>
<P>This vital liquid when recently drawn from a living &s;ubject, and received into a ve&s;&s;el, exhibits in a very obvious manner the following remark|able phenomena:</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, while it is yet warm, a &s;ubtle halitus a&s;cends from it, which being collected in a receiver, forms &s;mall pellucid globules, &s;imilar in appearance to drops of dew; it is of an aqueous nature, re&s;embling not a little common fountain water, except that it emits a peculiar nidorous &s;mell, (&s;till more con&s;iderable in the blood of car|nivorous

animals) and which may be aptly called the <HI>animal odour;</HI> &s;uch, for example, as ari&s;es from fre&s;h urine, or from the thoracic and abdo|minal cavities of a dead &s;ubject recently opened. Of this aqueous liquor a con&s;iderable quantity re|mains in a &s;tate of mixture with the other con&s;ti|tuent parts of the blood, which &s;hall be hereafter mentioned.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="8" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>&sect; 8.</HEAD>
<P>In the mean while, as the blood contained in the ve&s;&s;el &s;uffers a gradual reduction of tempera|ture, it begins to &s;eparate into two parts. A coagulum is fir&s;t formed, from the &s;uperficies and &s;ides of which, there pre&s;ently ex&s;udes a liquor of an intermediate &s;hade between pale yellow, and evane&s;cent red, which they call the <HI>&s;erum</HI> of the blood; in proportion as this liquor accumu|lates by ex&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation, a corre&s;ponding diminution is ob&s;ervable in the volume of the coagulum it&s;elf; the coagulum thus reduced in &s;ize has been di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>cra&s;&s;amentum,</HI> as al&s;o by tho&s;e of the <HI>liver,</HI> and <HI>placenta</HI> of the blood, from a re&s;emblance, in point of colour and fran|gibility of texture &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t between it and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;e two bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s; it has been likewi&s;e called <HI>the i&s;land,</HI> from the circum&s;tance of its being held in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tant or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing &s;tate in the &s;urrounding &s;erum.</P>

<P>This cra&s;&s;amentum it&s;elf, by a delicate treatment, &s;uch as gentle agitation or frequent ablutions in water, may be again &s;eparated into two con&s;tituent parts, viz. the <HI>cruor,</HI> which imparts the red co|lour to the whole ma&s;s of blood, and which by ablution is carried off from the <HI>lymph,</HI> the other and more &s;ub&s;tantial part, and which, therefore, is called the ba&s;is of the cra&s;&s;amentum; that the cruor retains for this ba&s;is a much &s;tronger af|finity than the &s;erum po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, is &s;ufficiently ob|vious from this circum&s;tance, that the cruor and ba&s;is cannot be di&s;parted unle&s;s by the interpo|&s;ition of a certain degree of force. The lymph it&s;elf being robbed of the cruor, becomes more and more pale until it finally a&s;&s;umes the appearance of a white and con&s;iderably tenaceous coagulum.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; 10.</HEAD>
<P>Such then appears to be the four principal con|&s;tituent parts of the blood,&mdash;viz. the watery <HI>halitus;</HI> the <HI>&s;erum;</HI> the <HI>cruor,</HI> or red globules; and the coagulable <HI>lymph;</HI> which &s;everal parts, as long as they retain their native degree of viral temperature, continue in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t equable mixture, con&s;tituting an uniform and homogeneous fluid.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="028310_0022_0FD8964EFB604970">It will now be proper to enter into a more mi|nute con&s;ideration of tho&s;e three portions of the blood which &s;tand la&s;t in the above enumeration: As to the aqueous exhalation which we have men|tioned, it does not appear of &s;ufficient importance to claim any further attention; indeed as it is al&s;o di&s;covered in other parts of the body, it cannot be con&s;idered as proper to the blood alone, any more than the air which this vital fluid contains, and on which we will &s;tate a few ob&s;ervations in a &s;ub&s;equent part of this &s;ection.</P>

<P>Upon the whole, the cau&s;es, which augment the quantity of the red globules in general, and al&s;o heighten the inten&s;ity of their colour, are &s;ufficiently evident: but to di&s;cover from what &s;ecret &s;ource their di&s;po&s;ition to this crim&s;on dye is originally derived, is a matter of Herculean difficulty indeed. Haller a&s;cribed it to the pre|&s;ence of <HI>crocus martis,</HI> becau&s;e the blood abounds more with iron than the bones, or other parts of the body, although the quantity contained, even in the blood it&s;elf, is very &s;mall; and although authors differ a&s;toni&s;hingly in their attempts to a&s;certain it. Thus, for in&s;tance, Menghinus e&s;ti|mated its relative proportion to the whole ma&s;s of the blood, to be as 1 to 110; whereas, the illu&s;|trious Rhades calculated it to be only as 1 to 427; and again, in &s;ome future experiments, to be no more than as 1 to 503, &amp;c.</P>

<P>This, in former times, was very erroneou&s;ly confounded with the &s;erum, from which it is not|with&s;tanding very widely different, in all its e&s;&s;en|tial properties.

<P>The &s;imilitude which prevails between the mem|brane thus formed by art, and certain remarkable phenomena in di&s;ea&s;es, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e of an inflammatory nature, reduces it to a certainty, that &s;uch phenomena are to be entirely referred to the coagulation of the lymph, of which we are now treating.</P>

agreeably to the opinion of William Hunter, or whether it merely tran&s;udes, by &s;imple diapede&s;is, through the patulous mouths of arteries?

<P>WE enter now on the con&s;ideration of a difficult &s;ubject, namely, <HI>the living &s;olid,</HI> and &s;hall attempt a full account of the vital energies, by which the different parts of our body appear to be animated and fitted, as well to receive the impul&s;e of &s;timuli, as to perform the various mo|tions which are nece&s;&s;ary in the economy of the living &s;y&s;tem.</P>

by the living &s;olid it&s;elf, con&s;idered as a mate|rial body. We will confine our&s;elves &s;olely to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e energies which re&s;ide in our body as a &s;y&s;tem of organi&s;ed matter, and which appear to be related to each other in the following order.</P>

<P>The fir&s;t and mo&s;t univer&s;al &s;pecies of tho&s;e vi|tal energies, and which may indeed be regarded as an inferior degree of the others, or rather as the thre&s;hold leading to them, is &s;imple <HI>contractility,</HI> i. e. a propen&s;ity in a part to contract it&s;elf.

<P>Another of the vital energies is, the <HI>irritability of Haller,</HI> which re&s;ides in mu&s;cular fibres only, and may therefore be called the <HI>vis mu&s;cularis.</HI> It manife&s;ts it&s;elf by a very &s;ingular, o&s;cillatory and tremulous motion, ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from &s;imple contraction, by its being more readily ex|cited to action on the application of any acrid &s;ti|mulus.</P>

<P>In&s;tances of &s;uch &s;igularity of action we have in the motions of the iris; the erection of the papilla in the brea&s;ts of females; the motions of the fim|bria; of the fallopian tubes; the action of the placenta; the action of the uterus in parturition; the de&s;cent of the te&s;tes in the male foetus; and, if I am not deceived, in a great part, if not in the whole of the proce&s;s of &s;ecretion.</P>

for example, that namele&s;s trunk from which the right carotid and &s;ubclavian arteries diverge as branches, and al&s;o the brachial trunk, together with its branches, the radial and cubital arteries, and having formed a rectangular triangle, from the diameter of the trunk and the diameters of its appended ramifications, I found, from the well known theorem of Pythagoras, that the &s;quare of the hypothenu&s;e was equal to the &s;um of the &s;quares of the ba&s;e and perpendicular.</P>
<P>Indeed, in arteries of the &s;malle&s;t orders, Haller him&s;elf acknowledged that the capacity of the trunks is greater than that of their ramifications; &s;o that, at lea&s;t, the common calculation does not apply univer&s;ally, but, (if it be indeed ever admi&s;|&s;ible), mu&s;t be re&s;tricted to a very few orders of ve&s;&s;els.</P>

there are not wanting in&s;tances of &s;ome arteries which in their progre&s;s rather widen and expand, &s;uch, for example, are the mammariae internae, or internal mammaries, and even the arch of the aorta it&s;elf is more contracted at its ba&s;e than at its apex or top.

The truth of this po&s;ition will be obvious to any one who con&s;iders, that in the different parts of the body, e&s;pecially in the vi&s;cera, the arteries are &s;ubject to great variety with re&s;pect to their divi&s;ions; and that, on this account, they &s;ometimes form more, &s;ometimes fewer orders of ve&s;&s;els, previou&s;ly to their &s;epa|ration into evane&s;cent capillaries.</P>
<P>Hence the di&s;agreement of authors who have attempted to amu&s;e them&s;elves with calculations of this kind. Thus, for example, Keil e&s;timated the number of the orders of arteries at fifty, while

<P>Speaking in general terms, there exi&s;ts a very con&s;iderable re&s;emblance between the arteries and the heart it&s;elf: that the arteries, for example, have a <HI>mu&s;cular coat,</HI> is a fact of the utmo&s;t pub|licity (&sect; 72.)</P>

<P>Though the truth of this la&s;t propo&s;ition is generally believed to be e&s;tabli&s;hed and confirmed by the &s;imple te&s;timony of the &s;en&s;es them&s;elves, the &s;ubject is neverthele&s;s &s;till embarra&s;&s;ed with

various doubts and difficulties: the&s;e difficulties immediately ri&s;e to view, when it is a&s;ked, whether this vibrating or pul&s;atory motion, which is felt on examination by the finger, is to be attributed to the inherent energy of the ar|teries, or to the impul&s;e of the heart; and whether the whole motion of the arteries does not depend &s;olely on the impetus with which the blood is projected into the aorta, and thus im|pinges again&s;t the &s;ides of that tube, and its rami|fications?</P>
<P>Di&s;&s;ections of living animals have not been &s;uf|ficient to decide this controver&s;y. For it &s;ome|times happens that during the live-di&s;&s;ections of warm blooded animals you may di&s;cover the lar|ger arteries pul&s;ating, while at other times again they appear in a &s;tate of complete re&s;t.

<P>When all circum&s;tances relative to this &s;ubject are impartially weighed and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately con&s;i|dered, this appears to be the re&s;ult, viz. that the <HI>dia&s;tole</HI> of the larger arteries takes place in con&s;e|quence of their peculiar nature, and is to be attri|buted to the impetus of the blood ru&s;hing for|cibly into them, and expanding their coats or tu|nics, which, by means of their ela&s;ticity, imme|diately return again to their natural dimen&s;ions.

<P>But in a &s;ound &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem, we contend that the arteries &s;carcely exhibit any unequivocal proofs of a <HI>true &s;y&s;tole,</HI> i. e. they do not by a ge|nuine contraction recede from their <HI>natural,</HI> to <HI>&s;maller</HI> dimen&s;ions, as long as the heart is adequate to the due performance of its momentous func|tion; but although it be certain, that the arteries do not always, yet we acknowledge that they do &s;ometimes, exhibit and exerci&s;e a power of real contraction: thus for in&s;tance, when the heart is

That the&s;e minute valves are of the utmo&s;t importance in promoting and continuing the regular and free circulation of the blood, is &s;atisfactorily demon&s;trated by the fre|quent conge&s;tions and infarctions, which happen in tho&s;e veins that originate in the inferior parts of the abdominal cavity, and which are entirely de|&s;titute of &s;uch valves.</P>

<P>Enquiries have been in&s;tituted for the purpo&s;e of a&s;certaining the nature of tho&s;e changes which the air we in&s;pire undergoes in our lungs. Such changes certainly do not ari&s;e, as was formerly believed, from the lo&s;s of any my&s;terious principle of ela&s;ticity, which re&s;ides in the air, but are evi|dently produced by a decompo&s;ition of its elemen|tary parts. For the atmo&s;pheric air which we breathe is truly an a&s;toni&s;hing mixture of elemen|tary &s;ub&s;tances, very widely different from each other in their natures. Not to mention the va|rious heterogenous matters which this nece&s;&s;ary fluid contains; &s;uch, for example, as the aerial &s;eeds of the &s;malle&s;t and mo&s;t &s;imple plants, the odorous effluvia ari&s;ing from numerous bodies, volumes of du&s;t, and a thou&s;and other &s;imilar &s;ub|&s;tances, which for the mo&s;t part float in the at|mo&s;phere. Not to mention, I &s;ay, the&s;e hetero|genous bodies at all, the air which we breathe always contains aqueous exhalations in larger or &s;maller quantities, and is al&s;o more or le&s;s charged with the matters of electricity and magneti&s;m. But finally, though the whole of the foregoing &s;ub&s;tances be left entirely out of view, yet even then the air of our atmo&s;phere does not con&s;i&s;t of one &s;imple aeriform fluid, but is compo&s;ed of de|phlogi&s;ticated, phlogi&s;ticated, and fixed airs.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="028310_0121_0FD882B30E793340">The proportion of tho&s;e elementary matters, e&s;pecially of &s;uch as are organic, is varied ex|tremely from diver&s;ity of places, and by the nature of the bodies which exi&s;t in the&s;e places.

<DIV3 N="148" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>&sect; 148.</HEAD>
<P>THE leading function of re&s;piration has been already the &s;ubject of our con&s;ideration. We will &s;peak, in another place, of the part which this &s;ublime proce&s;s acts, in blending and intimately uniting the chyle with the blood, and al&s;o of the &s;ervices which it renders, in a variety of ways, to almo&s;t the whole cla&s;s of <HI>natural functions,</HI> (&sect; 63.112.) We now proceed to con&s;ider its other u&s;es in the animal economy.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t object or phenomenon which attracts our attention, in this inve&s;tigation, is the Voice, which belongs to the human &s;ubject after birth, and evidently proceeds from the lungs, as was long &s;ince very ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by Ari&s;totle, who &s;aid, that no animals are vocal, <HI>i. e.</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of emitting &s;ound, but &s;uch as breathe through lungs. For, by the denomination of <HI>voice,</HI> we properly de&s;ignate that &s;ound formed, by means of the ex&s;pired air, in the <HI>larynx,</HI> which is a &s;mall apparatus or machine of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;truc|ture, placed on the top of the wind-pipe or <HI>a&s;pera

arteria,</HI> &s;omewhat like a capital on the &s;ummit of a column.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="149" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>&sect; 149.</HEAD>
<P>This &s;mall machine is compo&s;ed of various car|tilages joined together &s;omewhat after the form of a cap&s;ula or ca&s;ket. The&s;e cartilages are furni&s;hed with a great and truly admirable apparatus of mu&s;|cles, in con&s;equence of which, not only the whole are rendered fit for motion collectively, but &s;ome of them are al&s;o enabled to move individually and alone, according to the different variations about to be produced in the voice.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="150" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>&sect; 150.</HEAD>
<P>That part which is more particularly engaged in the immediate generation of the voice is the <HI>glottis,</HI> a very narrow pa&s;&s;age leading into the wind-pipe from above, to which is prefixed, or applied as a lid, a minute cartilage called the <HI>epiglottis.</HI> That &s;ound is produced by the air expelled from the lungs, &s;triking, in a proper direction and with due force, again&s;t the edges of this &s;trait pa&s;&s;age, is a matter too plain to admit of a doubt.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="151" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>&sect; 151.</HEAD>
<P>Controver&s;ies have exi&s;ted on the &s;ubject of tho&s;e changes that take place in the glottis, by which the modulations of the voice are produced,
<PB N="112" REF="028310_0126_0FD882BEAC0AEED0">
namely, Whether this cartilaginous part be alter|nately expanded and contracted, as was the opi|nion of Galen, and afterwards of Dodart? or, Whether the variations of the voice do not rather depend on the ten&s;ion and relaxation of its liga|ments, as was held by Ferrein?</P>
<P>The latter of tho&s;e, therefore, compared the primary organ of the voice to a <HI>violin,</HI> the former to a <HI>flute</HI>&mdash;i. e. the one &s;et of di&s;putants conceived it to emit &s;ound on the principles of a <HI>corded,</HI> the other on tho&s;e of a <HI>wind, in&s;trument</HI> of mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>From a faithful collection, and impartial con&s;i|deration, of all the arguments which have been advanced on this conte&s;ted point, we are of opi|nion, that both kinds of changes do actually take place in the glottis when employed in the emi&s;&s;ion of &s;ound; but we, neverthele&s;s, believe, that the principal and mo&s;t important of tho&s;e changes de|pend on and ari&s;e from the ten&s;ion of the liga|ments, more e&s;pecially of the <HI>thyreo-arytonoidel inferiores</HI> (which appear to have been the vocal cords of Ferrein.</P>

<P>But <HI>&s;ong,</HI> which is compo&s;ed of &s;peech and a harmonious modulation of the voice, I would con|&s;ider as peculiar to man alone, and as con&s;tituting the leading prerogative of his vocal organs. The faculty of whi&s;tling is, as already ob&s;erved, a part of the birth-right of birds: a numerous train of the feathered race, and &s;ometimes even dogs them|&s;elves, have al&s;o been taught to pronounce a va|riety
<PB N="114" REF="028310_0128_0FD882C0295538F8">
of words. But I doubt extremely indeed, whether any brute animals have ever yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a faculty of true and genuine &s;ong; whereas, on the other hand, I believe there &s;carcely exi&s;ts a a nation &s;o barbarous, where &s;ong does not very generally prevail.</P>

<DIV3 N="155" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>&sect; 155.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Speech</HI> it&s;elf is a peculiar modification of the voice, chiefly by the aid of the tongue, but par|tially al&s;o by that of the lips, the teeth, the palate, and by the further a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the no&s;e, combined into the formation of words.</P>
<P>Hence the difference between <HI>voice</HI> and <HI>&s;peech</HI> appears very obvious and plain: the fir&s;t is evi|dently formed in the larynx it&s;elf; whereas the latter is effected by the &s;ingular mechani&s;m of the other organs already mentioned. It is but ju&s;t and proper, however, to ob&s;erve, that this la&s;t po&s;ition is not capable of univer&s;al application, as there are a few nations (of which the Sinen&s;ians may &s;erve as an example), among whom their al|mo&s;t <HI>homonymous</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A word is &s;aid to be homonymous, when it is highly equivocal, or u&s;ed indi&s;criminately to repre&s;ent a di&s;cordant variety of objects or things.</NOTE> words are di&s;tingui&s;hed only by a varied modulation of the <HI>voice</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="028310_0129_0FD88252BAD3B140">But further, voice belongs in common to brutes as well as to man; it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed al&s;o by the new-born babe, nor is it wholly denied to &s;uch unhap|py infants as have pa&s;&s;ed their lives amid&s;t the haunts, and in the gloomy &s;ociety, of wild bea&s;ts, nor even to tho&s;e that have been born without the &s;en&s;e of hearing.

<P>The whole drift and tenor of Crawford's theory obviou&s;ly re&s;ults in this, that <HI>re&s;piration,</HI> no le&s;s than <HI>combu&s;tion,</HI> belongs to &s;uch proce&s;&s;es as are called phlogi&s;tic; in which the phlogi&s;ton re&s;iding in, and con&s;tituting a part of, our bodies, is ex|pelled by the acce&s;&s;ion of <HI>free</HI> or <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> heat, (which ought to be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed from heat exi&s;ting in a <HI>fixed</HI> or <HI>latent</HI> &s;tate.)</P>
<P>For phlogi&s;ton and the matter of heat are ele|ments of &s;uch contrary and oppo&s;ite natures, that the greater quantity of the one our bodies at any time contain, the le&s;s, at the &s;ame time, is their proportion of the other; thus, fixed air, for ex|ample, is not &s;uppo&s;ed to contain more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th part of the quantity of the matter of heat, which belongs to an equal weight of atmo&s;pheric air, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But it appears, from experiments, that atmo|&s;pheric air has a &s;tronger affinity to phlogi&s;ton than to the matter of heat, &s;o that it unites it&s;elf with the greate&s;t readine&s;s to the former, while, at the &s;ame time, it &s;ets at liberty the latter, which had been hitherto held in a fixed and latent &s;tate.</P>

<P>When we come to apply the foregoing po&s;i|tions and principles to the phenomena of re&s;pira|tion, it appears highly probable, that animal heat is generated by a proce&s;s of a &s;imilar nature.</P>
<P>For, as we have already had occa&s;ion to ob|&s;erve, the air which we ex&s;pire differs, in a very remarkable degree, from what we had immediately before in&s;pired; being deprived of its igneous portion, or of that part fit for contributing to the &s;upport of flame, it is returned highly impreg|nated, on the contrary, with phlogi&s;ton and the ba&s;e of fixed air.

<P>It appears, therefore, extremely probable, that the igneous portion of the air we breathe enters tho&s;e minute blood-ve&s;&s;els, which are every where di&s;per&s;ed throughout the &s;ub&s;tance of the lungs, and &s;eparated from the air-ve&s;icles them&s;elves by nothing more than &s;ubtle partitions of the mo&s;t filmy texture (&sect; 136); that from the lungs it is conveyed through the pulmonary veins to the aorta, from whence it is again, by means of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, di&s;tributed throughout every part of the body.</P>

This phlo|gi&s;tic principle, being thus mixed with the blood, and occupying the place ju&s;t evacuated by the matter of heat, is conveyed back, by means of the venous &s;y&s;tem to the right &s;ide of the heart, and from thence by the pulmonary artery, into the lungs, where, agreeably to tho&s;e laws of affinity which we ju&s;t now hinted at, it is immediately received and taken up by the volume of air recently in&s;pired. In con&s;equence of the acce&s;&s;ion of this quantity of phlogi&s;ton, and its union with the air contained in the lungs, a fre&s;h portion of the element of fire or heat is &s;et at liberty, which in&s;tantly enters the blood and is thus ince&s;&s;antly di&s;tributed throughout the &s;y&s;tem in the manner already de&s;cribed.</P>

<P>The nugatory calculations, re&s;pecting the a&s;to|ni&s;hing rapidity, with which the animal &s;pirits have been &s;uppo&s;ed to hurry through their nervous canals, in all parts of the &s;y&s;tem, are &s;ubjects too hypothetical and vi&s;ionary to merit our time, or command our attention.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXX. OF THE BILE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Doctor Maclurg, of Virginia, publi&s;hed in the year 1772, an experimental treati&s;e on the formation, the nature and the u&s;es of the human bile, which has acquired for its learned and ingenious author, no &s;mall degree of reputation both at home and abroad. That this elaborate publication po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an uncommon &s;hare of merit, not even the avowed enemies of the Doctor are them&s;elves able to deny. The author has &s;hewn him&s;elf to be, at lea&s;t, a very patient expe|rimenter, and an extremely attentive ob&s;erver. He appears to have made him&s;elf perfectly ma&s;ter of the opinions of all authors of celebrity and di&s;tinction, who had previou&s;ly writ|ten on the &s;ame &s;ubject. With regard to the literary merit of the compo&s;ition it&s;elf, it is doubtle&s;s entitled to the highe&s;t en|comiums that even the mo&s;t partial eulogi&s;t can be&s;tow. The order is inimitably lucid, the &s;tyle is cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e, manly and ner|vous in the highe&s;t degree, and as to clo&s;ene&s;s and propriety of argumentative arrangement, not even the &s;upercilious lo|gitian him&s;elf, can find room to &s;ugge&s;t the &s;hadow of an amendment.</P>
<P>All human compo&s;itions are, however, like the &s;ources from whence they originate, in &s;ome mea&s;ure faulty and im|perfect. To this general maxim, humiliating as it may ap|pear to the pride of the &s;elf-adoring philo&s;opher, the treati&s;e of the illu&s;trious Maclurg is by no means an exception. In &s;everal of the Doctor's experiments there appears to be a want of &s;ufficient accuracy and definitude, in others a want of object and de&s;ign. Over the&s;e faults, however, con&s;ider|able as they are in the works of an experimentali&s;t, we feel inclined to &s;pread a kind mantle of palliation, when we re|collect that our author experimented and wrote in the early morn of &s;cientific chemi&s;try. Experimenters had not yet be|come perfect adopts in their nice and momentous art; they had not yet acquired &s;ufficient circum&s;pection and addre&s;s to obviate every &s;ource of fallacy, and to avail them&s;elves of every circum&s;tance that might pave the way to &s;atisfactory and unequivocal re&s;ults.</P>
<P>But another cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge of a more weighty and important na|ture, lies again&s;t our learned and ingenious author. He h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s certainly built, on nothing more &s;ub&s;tantial than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lim&s;y ba&s;is of deceptious analogy, &s;ome of the leading principles of his favourite doctrine&punc; Thus, for example, he &s;uppo&s;es the bile to be a fluid, the direct re&s;ult of a putrefactive degene|racy in a portion of the circulating volume of the blood. His mo&s;t plau&s;ible rea&s;ons in &s;upport of this opinion are, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that the parts, from whence the incipient radicles of the vena portarum immediately originate, contain, and communicate with, matter already in a &s;emiputre&s;cent &s;tate. And <HI>&s;econd|ly,</HI> that the bile is mo&s;t abundant in quantity and mo&s;t active with regard to its quality, at that &s;ea&s;on, and under tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which are mo&s;t favourable to the commence|ment and progre&s;s of putrefaction in the living &s;y&s;tem, as well as in all other phy&s;ical bodies.</P>
<P>Plau&s;ible as tho&s;e arguments may, on fir&s;t view appear, they are certainly, as already ob&s;erved, founded on nothing better than fair, but fallacious analogy. The principle which they tend to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;tands in the mo&s;t direct oppo&s;i|tion to the re&s;ult of experiment&mdash;&s;acred experiment! the on|ly unerring guide to conduct the candid enquirer to the ever|la&s;ting temple of truth. Did our learned author (I would beg leave to a&s;k) ever faithfully experiment on &s;eparate por|tions of the blood, drawn from different parts of the body, in order to determine the comparative proximity of each portion, to the putrefactive &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate? I pre&s;ume he never did, otherwi&s;e his opinion on this &s;ubject would have been, doubtle&s;s, very diff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rent from what we find in his ingenious publication. For it is a truth, nothing the le&s;s &s;acred and re&s;pectable on account of its novelty, that if equal quantities of blood be taken from the <HI>vena p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rtarum,</HI> and from the lungs or any part of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, and expo&s;ed to the &s;ame incumbent circum&s;tances, the <HI>pulmonic</HI> or <HI>arterial,</HI> will a&s;&s;ume the putre|factive proce&s;s, much &s;ooner than the <HI>hepatic,</HI> blood. The cau&s;e of this phenomenon mu&s;t be &s;ufficiently obvious to any one acquainted with the late di&s;coveries, in the divine &s;cience of chemi&s;try. We would attempt its &s;olution in the follow|ing manner.</P>
<P>Vital air (which is indeed the genuine &s;eptic principle, if any &s;uch principle exi&s;t) is in all ca&s;es e&s;&s;ential to the progre&s;s of putrefaction. This air, or rather its ba&s;e (termed oxygene by the ingenious chemi&s;ts of France) is, as we have the &s;trong|e&s;t rea&s;ons to believe, from the experiments of Goodwyn, Beddoes, Girtanner, and others, intimately blended with the circulating blood in its pa&s;&s;age through the lungs. As the blood proceeds in its mazy route through the different parts of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, it is gradually robbed of its concommi|tant oxygene or ba&s;e of vital air, by the my&s;terious action of the animal &s;y&s;tem. The con&s;equence of this &s;poliation is, that the florid <HI>arterial,</HI> a&s;&s;umes a much darker colour, and &s;uf|fers finally a complete tran&s;mutation into <HI>venous</HI> blood. In this latter &s;tate the putrefactive proce&s;s is le&s;s apt to com|mence, becau&s;e the blood contains le&s;s oxygene in a &s;tate of intimate mixture, or perhaps I might with more propriety &s;ay, in a &s;tate of combination. For in proportion as the ba&s;e of vital air is more intimately blended with, and therefore more nearly approximated to, the con&s;tituent parts of the blood, the more powerfully can it co-operate with other aux|iliary agents, in inducing <HI>the&s;e parts</HI> to a&s;&s;ume that inte&s;tine motion, which con&s;titutes the putrefactive proce&s;s. Although our learned author is decidedly of opinion, that putrefaction commences more readily, if vital air be excluded altogether from the putrefying &s;ub&s;tances, yet it is now well know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that the very rever&s;e of this is true. Exclude vital air from a body, in the compo&s;ition of which none of this energetic fluid exi&s;ts, and you thereby embalm that body in a deg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> equal, if not &s;uperior to the embalmment of the unperi&s;hable mummies of the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>No body, whatever, is capable of taking on the putrefac|tive proce&s;s, that does not contain in its compo&s;ition more or le&s;s of tho&s;e &s;imple &s;ub&s;tances that belong to the cla&s;s of <HI>inflammables.</HI> Rea&s;oning therefore a <HI>priori,</HI> or climbing the arduous &s;teeps of &s;cience by the more laborious &s;teps of expe|riment and ob&s;ervation, we are warranted in either ca&s;e to conclude, that putrefaction con&s;i&s;ts, in a very con&s;iderable degree, in the intimate combination of the ba&s;e of vital air to certain &s;ub&s;tances of an inflammable nature. Both the pri|mary elements of which putrefiable bodies are compo&s;ed, and al&s;o the re&s;ults of actual putrefaction, co-operate in the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the &s;ame conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is certainly a truth, that vital air is as e&s;&s;ential to the putrefactive proce&s;s as it is to the &s;upport of combu&s;tion, or the continuance of animal life.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, we may without the &s;malle&s;t he&s;itation conclude, that the former opinions of phy&s;iologi&s;ts re&s;pecting the &s;uppo&s;ed putre&s;cent di&s;po&s;ition of the hepatic blood, are wholly in&s;upportable by argument or fact, being indeed di|rectly oppo&s;ed to the literal re&s;ult of po&s;itive experiment; and therefore, that the pious eulogia &s;o profu&s;ely be&s;towed on the powers of the animal economy, in being able to form an <HI>anti&s;eptic</HI> out of a highly <HI>putre&s;cent</HI> fluid, appear to be as vi&s;ionary and hypothetical, as <HI>nature's</HI> final intention in the preparation of this fluid was thought to be beneficent, and her proce&s;s it&s;elf beautiful, and intere&s;ting.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>

<P>The <HI>mu&s;cular</HI> coat con&s;i&s;ts of two orders of fibres, to wit, <HI>longitudinal,</HI> which are interrupted in their cour&s;e, and run rather <HI>externally,</HI> e&s;peci|ally on that &s;ide of the inte&s;tine that looks in a contrary direction from the me&s;entery; and more <HI>internal, annular,</HI> or <HI>falciform</HI> fibres, which are calculated to contract or narrow the diameter of the tube; whereas the former are intended to di|mini&s;h its longitudinal extent. On both the pre|ceding orders of fibres depends that exqui&s;itely energetic and pertinacious <HI>irritability</HI> of the inte&s;|tines, of which we have &s;poken on a former occa|&s;ion (&sect; 306.)</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="028310_0401_0FDAB828BB1BD600">The <HI>nervous</HI> coat con&s;i&s;ts of compacted cellular membrane; and may, by a very &s;imple mode of treatment, e&s;pecially by blowing into it, be again reduced to a &s;pongy, foam-like ti&s;&s;ue: throughout this coat a variety of blood-ve&s;&s;els, detached from the me&s;enteric, are di&s;tributed in the form of ar|borets or branching &s;hrubs, of inimitable elegance and beauty.

<P>The&s;e minute glands are commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t of three orders. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> the Brunnerian or larger glands, which are &s;eparate from each other, and &s;ituated principally on that part of the duode|num, which lies next to the pylorus.</P>

<P>It ought to be ob&s;erved, however, that this di|vi&s;ion of the &s;ources of mucus appears to re&s;t on very equivocal evidence.

&s;uperficies of the chorion, a membrane attached to, and even in&s;erted in, the <HI>decidua cra&s;&s;a:</HI> Hence we perceive that the placenta is a body compo&s;ed of two different kinds of &s;ub&s;tance, re|ceived from an equal number of &s;ources.

<P>At this time the increa&s;e of the tender ovum is unequal, &s;o that the growth of the &s;mooth por|tion of the chorion is greater and more rapid than that of the <HI>mu&s;co&s;um</HI> or mo&s;s-like; hence it is evident, that the relative magnitude of the placenta to that of the whole volume of the egg, is greater in proportion as the conception is more recent, and le&s;s, on the other hand, accordingly as the period of parturition is nearer.</P>
<P>As pregnancy gradually advances, the placenta becomes more and more clo&s;e and compact in its texture; it is impre&s;&s;ed with grooves, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed into lobes on its <HI>external</HI> &s;urface which re&s;pects the uterus, but is &s;mooth and highly po|li&s;hed on its <HI>internal,</HI> which, looking towards the

<P>Although all phy&s;iologi&s;ts uniformly concur in this, that the <HI>placenta</HI> is the principal organ through the medium of which the tender foetus is &s;upplied with nutriment, yet various contro|ver&s;ies have latterly exi&s;ted among them re&s;pect|ing the genuine mode of <HI>its</HI> official action, and its reciprocal relation, as well to the uterus as to the foetus. From an attentive and impartial con&s;ide|ration of all the te&s;timony that can be collected on this &s;ubject, the re&s;ult appears to be, that there exi&s;ts no direct ana&s;tomo&s;is between the blood-|ve&s;&s;els of the maternal uterus and tho&s;e of the umbilical cord; but the arterial blood which pa&s;&s;es by a continuous route from the uterus of the mother to that portion of the placenta that owes its origin to the decidua cra&s;&s;a, is there ab&s;orbed by the inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ient radicles of the umbilical veins, that are di&s;tributed throughout the mo&s;s-like por|tion of the chorion, and thus conducted into the

venous trunk of the <HI>funis umbilicalis:</HI> while, on the other hand, the blood which is conveyed back from the foetus by the umbilical arteries, being in like manner effu&s;ed into the parenchyma of the placenta, is taken up by the venous radi|cles of its uterine portion, and thus finally re-con|veyed into the &s;ub&s;tance of the uterus it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The foregoing opinions receive additional con|firmation from the many well guarded but fruit|le&s;s attempts that have been made by different phy&s;iologi&s;ts to inject the ve&s;&s;els of the umbilical cord through tho&s;e of the uterus, or, on the other hand, to fill the <HI>ve&s;&s;els</HI> of the latter organ by in|jections forced through <HI>tho&s;e</HI> of the former. As a further evidence in &s;upport of the &s;ame prin|ciples, we may mention the difference which is ob&s;erved to exi&s;t between the pul&s;e of the mother and that of the foetus before their final di&s;en|gagement from each other; and la&s;tly, it may not be improper to add, as a circum&s;tance tend|ing to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;ame re&s;ult, the ob&s;ervations which we formerly delivered re&s;pect|ing the difference between the nature of the foetal and that of the maternal blood (&sect; 147).</P>

<P>With regard to the parenchymatous portion of the impregnated uterus, it becomes gradually more and more lax and &s;pongy, e&s;pecially where it is in contact with the ovum contained; &s;o that towards its fundus or bottom it becomes con&s;ider|ably thick, and in a living and healthy female, is greatly di&s;tended with blood, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the powers of life in a very high degree.

During the continuance of the former &s;tate, the <HI>foetus</HI> is connected, and pre&s;erves a cir|cular intercour&s;e with the uterine placenta, by means of the umbilical cord; it has never, as yet, in&s;pired air for the purpo&s;e of &s;upplying the blood with that vital pabulum, a proce&s;s which immedi|ately commences and is uniformly continued after birth, when this reciprocal connection between the mother and child, is finally de&s;troyed.</P>

<P>When, in the foetus, the blood is conveyed from the inferior vena cava to the right &s;ide of the heart, the greater part of it is denied a pa&s;&s;age from thence through the lungs, and is therefore directed towards the left or po&s;terior auricle of the heart, by the valve of Eu&s;tachius, and admit|ted into that cavity through the <HI>foramen ovale.</HI></P>

<P>For over the mouth of the inferior vena cava, after its a&s;cent from the cavity of the abdomen in the foetal &s;tate, a valve of a lunated figure is extended, which, in honour of its immortal di&s;coverer, has been called the valve of Eu&s;tachius.

<P>The orifice referred to in the preceding para|graph is called the <HI>foramen ovale,</HI> through which by far the greater part of the a&s;cending column of blood, derived immediately from the inferior vena cava, is conducted into the left <HI>auris</HI> of the heart during each dia&s;tole of the auricles: of this blood the regurgitation is effectually prevented, by the elegant falciform valve formerly mentioned, which is clo&s;ely &s;pread over the foramen, and appears to clo&s;e that orifice completely, during each &s;y&s;tolic motion of the auricles. During the fir&s;t years of infancy the <HI>foramen ovale</HI> is in part clo&s;ed by means of this &s;mall valve, and partly obliterated by the gradual but &s;low adhe&s;ion of its &s;ides: in cor|re&s;pondence to &s;uch adhe&s;ion, the valve of Eu&s;ta|chius it&s;elf undergoes al&s;o a &s;low and gradual diminution in point of &s;ize, till &s;carcely a wreck of it is left behind.</P>

<P>Of that blood which, at the &s;ame time, enters the right auricle of the heart from the &s;uperior vena cava, a very &s;mall portion only can be received by the lungs of the foetus, as yet in a weak and in|active condition: it is therefore taken up by the <HI>ductus arterio&s;us,</HI> from the trunk of the pulmonary artery (of which this duct is indeed the leading branch) and conveyed by a direct and &s;peedy route
<PB N="195" REF="028310_0439_0FD88D514BC42D30">
to the arch of the aorta, without pa&s;&s;ing through the lungs at all.

<HEAD>APPENDIX, IN WHICH IS EXHIBITED A Conden&s;ed and Summary View OF THE EXISTING DISCOVERIES AND SPECULATIONS Relative to the Subject of, what is u&s;ually denominated, ANIMAL ELECTRICITY.</HEAD>
<P>STEADY and uniform as the lap&s;e of time it&s;elf, are the exertions made by the enter|prize and indu&s;try of man, to &s;hed light on the <HI>arcana</HI> or <HI>&s;ecret proce&s;&s;es</HI> of nature. In proportion as &s;uch laudable attempts are pro&s;ecuted with boldne&s;s and crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, <HI>revolutions</HI> and <HI>improvements</HI> take place in the various branches of phy&s;ical &s;cience. Revolutions derive birth from the detection of error, while improvements re&s;ult from the di&s;covery of truth. On the repudiation of fal&s;e principles in &s;cience, as well as on the developement of new ones deduced from the reci|procal
<PB N="214" REF="028310_0457_0FD89B23EB2DFC50">
concurrence of numerous and unequivocal facts, it is not without the &s;anction of rea&s;on and propriety that new &s;y&s;tems are forthwith compiled, dige&s;ted and u&s;hered into the world.</P>
<P>For, to be complete and &s;atisfactory, a &s;y&s;tem in any branch of &s;cience, &s;hould embrace and ar|range in order all the well authenticated principles &s;pontaneou&s;ly re&s;ulting from facts already a&s;cer|tained and ob&s;ervations already made, relative to that particular branch. A &s;y&s;tem le&s;s general and comprehen&s;ive in its &s;cope than this, &s;hould be deemed, at be&s;t, but defective and partial, and received as the abortive production of a mind deficient in point of information.</P>
<P>Of the former de&s;cription was the famous phy|&s;iological &s;y&s;tem of Baron Haller, at the time its illu&s;trious author fir&s;t &s;ubmitted it to the eye of the world. That excellent phy&s;ician and philo&s;opher gra&s;ped in his acute and comprehen&s;ive mind, and detailed at large, in the work to which I here allude, all the authentic and well defined princi|ples re&s;ulting from the infinitude of facts with which the &s;cience of phy&s;iology was at that time enriched.</P>
<P>But all &s;y&s;tems are &s;tationary and have been as yet imperfect, while, happily for the intere&s;t of
<PB N="215" REF="028310_0458_0FD89B252FC4D9F0">
man, improvements in &s;cience are progre&s;&s;ive and advancing towards perfection. In the cour&s;e of a few years, &s;uch a blaze of phy&s;ical light was dif|fu&s;ed abroad by the indu&s;try and ingenuity of philo&s;ophers in general, but of phy&s;icians and chemi&s;ts in particular, that the deficiencies and errors of the Baron's elaborate &s;y&s;tem were ren|dered obvious to the mo&s;t weak and inattentive ob&s;erver. In the important <HI>doctrines</HI> re&s;pecting the <HI>cau&s;es</HI> of <HI>animal heat</HI> and the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>purpo&s;es</HI> of re&s;piration, in particular, entire revolu|tions were effected by the numerous and ingenious di&s;coveries of chemi&s;ts in that branch of &s;cience denominated aerology.</P>
<P>To &s;upply, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the deficiencies of this &s;y&s;tem of Haller, and to circumvent the errors which the authority of &s;o celebrated a cha|racter might tend to diffu&s;e throughout the minds of his numerous readers, became <HI>de&s;iderata</HI> of no &s;mall moment in the &s;cience of phy&s;iology.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t effectual method of accompli&s;hing the&s;e de&s;irable ends was too obvious to e&s;cape di&s;covery. For as violence is mo&s;t effectually repelled by counter violence, and one di&s;ea&s;e not unfrequently removed from the animal &s;y&s;tem by the impetuous inva&s;ion of another, &s;o in like manner, in &s;cience, the defects of one &s;y&s;tem are mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly
<PB N="216" REF="028310_0459_0FD89B29158DFD78">
&s;upplied, and its errors mo&s;t effectually contro|verted and expo&s;ed, by the plenitude and unequi|vocal certainty of the principles of a rival &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>This truth did not e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of that learned and acute profe&s;&s;or, of Goettingen, who now fills the chair which was formerly rendered vocal by the eloquence of the immortal Haller. Need I add, that profe&s;&s;or Blumenbach is the man to whom I allude&mdash;a man, for the completion of who&s;e greatne&s;s and utility in phy&s;ical &s;cience, nature and art appear to have all but exhau&s;ted their abundant re&s;ources! For indu&s;try and per&s;e|verance in the collection of materials, for powers to combine and arrange materials when thus col|lected, and for ingenuity and acumen to deduce and &s;peculate from &s;uch combination and arrange|ment, the pre&s;ent age certainly boa&s;ts few&mdash;too few phy&s;iologi&s;ts who may be &s;et in competition with the illu&s;trious Blumenbach.</P>
<P>For this phy&s;ician and philo&s;opher was re&s;erved the honourable and important ta&s;k of collecting, dige&s;ting and con&s;igning to publicity, a &s;y&s;tem of phy&s;iology de&s;tined to &s;upply the deficiencies and correct the errors of that which had already re&s;ulted from the labours of his celebrated friend and predece&s;&s;or. The &s;y&s;tem of profe&s;&s;or Blumen|bach was, like that of Baron Haller, perfect and
<PB N="217" REF="028310_0460_0FD89B2CB071F270">
complete at the time in which it was handed to the world. There exi&s;ted not, at that period, an e&s;tabli&s;hed principle, nor &s;carcely even a probable conjecture in phy&s;iology, with which he was not minutely acquainted, and which he did not draw into the exten&s;ive and powerful <HI>vortex</HI> of his &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Had the &s;cience of phy&s;iology been finally com|plete at the time in which profe&s;&s;or Blumenbach wrote, the indu&s;try, the immen&s;e re&s;ources and the comprehen&s;ive talents of that philo&s;opher would, no doubt, have quite precluded the nece&s;|&s;ity of future &s;y&s;tems in this branch of &s;cience. But in the unfathomed depths of the animal economy more <HI>arcana</HI> yet exi&s;ted&mdash;more <HI>terra incognita</HI> lay yet unexplored, and further re|&s;earches of enterpri&s;e were therefore e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>By the combined labours of experimental phy&s;i|ologi&s;ts in different parts of the world, this branch of &s;cience was at length matured for giving birth to another <HI>di&s;covery,</HI> which will probably be found of equal importance, in explaining the phenomena, and in removing the di&s;ea&s;es of the animal &s;y&s;tem, with that which con&s;igned to immortality the name of the illu&s;trious Harvey. The di&s;covery to which I wi&s;h at pre&s;ent to direct the attention of the reader is that of, what is u&s;ually called <HI>animal
<PB N="218" REF="028310_0461_0FD885C6177BAC48">
electricity,</HI> or, of the exi&s;tence and operation of a fluid extremely &s;imilar to electricity in the living animal &s;y&s;tem. For the fortunate Galvani pro|fe&s;&s;or of anatomy at Bologna, was re&s;erved the honour of lighting <HI>by accident</HI> on this beautiful and divine di&s;covery&mdash;a di&s;covery which entitles its author to be ranked with the great promoters &s;cience and the e&s;&s;ential benefactors of man.</P>
<P>That &s;uch a fluid did actually exi&s;t in the bo|dies of animals, had been long &s;u&s;pected by phy|&s;iologi&s;ts and other &s;peculative philo&s;ophers. The matter re&s;ted however on pure conjecture alone, and was yet un&s;anctioned by the te&s;ts of experi|ment and ob&s;ervation. The apparent intricacy of the &s;ubject depre&s;&s;ed the hopes of the bolde&s;t experimenters, and the &s;ubtlety of the inve&s;tiga|tion &s;eemed to throw an in&s;urmountable bar in the road to &s;ucce&s;s. But <HI>accident</HI> not unfrequently does more for the real advancement of &s;cience, than boa&s;ted genius and indu&s;try are able to ac|compli&s;h. It was accident that fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted to the celebrated Gallileo the con&s;truction and u&s;e of that optical in&s;trument denominated the <HI>tele|&s;cope</HI>&mdash;It was accident which fir&s;t led the immortal Newton to the original conception of that prin|ciple of <HI>gravitation,</HI> by which he afterwards ex|plained, with &s;uch facility, the movements and ex|qui&s;ite balance of the material univer&s;e. And it
<PB N="219" REF="028310_0462_0FD89B2F3648E190">
was, in like manner, accident&mdash;fortunate accident, that fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted to the indu&s;trious and acute Galvani the mode of experimenting, with effect, on the intricate &s;ubject of <HI>animal electricity</HI>&mdash;a &s;ubject which may po&s;&s;ibly be de&s;tined as the only proper clue to conduct future phy&s;iologi&s;ts to the genuine &s;prings and principles of life it&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Whil&s;t the profe&s;&s;or (alluding to Galvani) was engaged in di&s;&s;ecting a frog in a room where &s;ome of his friends were amu&s;ing them&s;elves with an electrical machine, one of them drew a &s;park from the conductor, at the &s;ame time that the profe&s;&s;or touched one of the nerves of the animal. In an in&s;tant the whole body of the frog was &s;hook by a violent convul&s;ion. The profe&s;&s;or was a&s;toni&s;hed at the phenomenon, and believed it owing to his having wounded the nerve; to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf whether this was really the ca&s;e, he pricked it with the point of his knife, without any motion of the body being produced; he now touched the nerve with the in&s;trument as at fir&s;t, and ordered a &s;park to be taken from the machine, on which the contractions were renewed. The experiment was repeated a third time, but the animal remained motionle&s;s; however, upon per|ceiving he held his &s;calpel by the handle, which was of ivory (a bad conductor), he changed it
<PB N="220" REF="028310_0463_0FD885C8684EF840">
for a metallic one, and re-excited the movements, which he con&s;tantly failed of doing whil&s;t u&s;ing an electric &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>"After having made a number of experiments with the elect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ical machine, he re&s;olved to pro&s;e|cute the &s;ubject with atmo&s;pheric electricity. To this end he rai&s;ed a conductor upon the roof of his hou&s;e, from which he brought an iron wire into his room, and to this attached metal con|ductors, connected with the nerves of the animals de&s;tined to be the &s;ubjects of his experiments, and to their legs he tied wires, which reached the floor. Con&s;iderable movements were ob&s;erved in the animals, whether of cold or warm blood, whenever it lightened. The&s;e preceded thun|der, and corre&s;ponded with its inten&s;ity and re|petition, and even when it did not lighten the movements took place when any &s;tormy cloud pa&s;&s;ed over the apparatus."</P>
<P>"Profe&s;&s;or Galvani one day &s;u&s;pended &s;ome frogs, perhaps with &s;imilar views, on metal hooks, fixed in the &s;pine of the back, upon the iron rail|ing of his garden; &s;everal times he remarked that the&s;e animals contracted, and appeared to receive &s;hocks; at fir&s;t he conceived the movements were owing to changes in the atmo&s;phere, but a more

&s;crupulous examination undeceived him&middot; Having placed a prepared frog <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the reader may not be entirely ignorant of what is meant by a prepared frog, I take the liberty of pre&s;enting him with the following brief extract from the fir&s;t experi|ment detailed in Dr. Valli's publication: "My fir&s;t experi|ment was made on a frog, in the following manner: I opened the abdomen in order to lay bare the &s;pine of the back, and di&s;cover the crural nerves which i&s;&s;ue from it; a few lines above this point I cut the animal in two, and by pa&s;&s;ing my &s;ci&s;&s;ars immediately under the origin of the&s;e nerves, re|moved the remaining portion of the vertebral column, &s;o as only to leave the vertebrae which united the bundle of nerves. Having enveloped this portion of the vertebrae with a piece of &s;heet lead, with one end of a metal conductor, I touched the coated part, and with the other the &s;urface of the thighs, which had been previou&s;ly &s;tripped of the &s;kin. The movements were violent, and continued for a long time," &amp;c. In general, throughout the whole of this phy&s;ician's expertmental treati&s;e, when one or more of the nerves of an animal are coated with &s;heet-lead or any other metal, that animal is &s;aid to be <HI>prepared.</HI></NOTE> upon an iron plate in his room, and happening with his di&s;&s;ecting forceps to pre&s;s it again&s;t the plate, he ob&s;erved the move|ments to take place. This experiment &s;ucceeded with all metallic bodies, but more particularly well with &s;ilver; non-conducting &s;ub&s;tances were not proper for it. From this period our author began to &s;u&s;pect the animal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an electricity of its own; and in this &s;u&s;picion he was further con|firmed by the following circum&s;tance:&mdash;He held

a prepared frog by a hook with one hand, &s;o as to let its feet re&s;t upon the bottom of a &s;mall &s;il|ver cup, which he happened unintentionally to &s;trike with the other; at the in&s;tant the body of the animal fell into violent convul&s;ions. If one per&s;on held the prepared frog, and another touch|ed the cup, no movements were excited. The profe&s;&s;or being now aware of the nece&s;&s;ity of a communication, undertook a &s;eries of experiments for the farther inve&s;tigation of this &s;ubject. He fir&s;t placed a prepared frog upon a non-conduct|ing &s;urface, and brought one end of a conductor in contact with the hook which &s;ecured the ani|mal, and with the other touched its feet, on which the contractions took place.

<P>No &s;ooner had profe&s;&s;or Galvani publi&s;hed to the world his experiments on animal electricity, than their &s;ame di&s;pread, &s;wift us the intangible fluid which they regarded, throughout the differ|ent parts of Europe. Animal electricity became, in a &s;hort time, a &s;ubject of very intere&s;ting &s;pecu|lation to medical philo&s;ophers.

<P>The objects which he appears to have kept &s;tea|dily in view throughout the whole cour&s;e of his experiments and ob&s;ervations were, to a&s;certain the <HI>nature</HI> of the animal fluid di&s;covered by the profe&s;&s;or of Bologna, and to determine its <HI>influ|ence</HI> and <HI>medium</HI> of operation in the animal eco|nomy. In the pro&s;ecution of the&s;e ends the Doc|tor has doubtle&s;s di&s;played all that indu&s;try and patient per&s;everance, &s;o e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite in the character who would &s;ucce&s;sfully inquire of na|ture, through the medium of experiment. I am &s;orry, however, to ob&s;erve, that all his experiments were not conceived and in&s;tituted with equal in|genuity, and perhaps I may add, not executed with equal accuracy and definitude. Many of
<PB N="224" REF="028310_0467_0FD89B3470BFD7D8">
them appear to have been in&s;tituted without a di|rect reference to any &s;pecific or particular end&mdash; Equally unhappy with regard to conception, inde|finite with re&s;pect to their nature, and inconclu|&s;ive in point of re&s;ult, they leave no <HI>impre&s;&s;ions</HI> on the mind of the reader, &s;ave tho&s;e of <HI>di&s;ap|pointment</HI> and <HI>regret</HI>&mdash;regret that a character of &s;uch learning and indu&s;try &s;hould, notwith&s;tand|ing, interrogate nature with &s;o little meaning, and (I am &s;orry to add) with &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The preceding ob&s;ervations mu&s;t be con&s;idered only in the light of <HI>general rules,</HI> and as &s;uch, are liable to numerous exceptions. Many of the experiments of Dr. Valli are, doubtle&s;s, both in|genious and valuable; and I even entertain the utmo&s;t confidence, that the period will yet arrive, when the whole of them, that are a&s;certained and related with ju&s;tne&s;s and definitude, will be made &s;ub&s;ervient to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of general and u&s;eful re&s;ults. At pre&s;ent, however, they &s;tand in an <HI>in&s;ulated</HI> &s;tate, completely detached from practical conclu&s;ions, and di&s;connected from all known principles in phy&s;ical &s;cience.</P>
<P>After a &s;eries of experiments &s;ufficiently lengthy and tedious, the Doctor conceived him&s;elf une|quivocally authori&s;ed to conclude, that the animal fluid of Galvani, was entirely the &s;ame with the
<PB N="225" REF="028310_0468_0FD885D1C98D9650">
&s;ubtle matter of electricity. This conclu&s;ion he alleges to be the &s;pontaneous and nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of the following po&s;itions, which he delivers as &s;ub&s;tantiated and confirmed by actual experiment.</P>
<P>"Fir&s;t, &s;ub&s;tances which conduct electricity, are conductors likewi&s;e of the nervous fluid."</P>
<P N="2">"2<HI>dly,</HI> Sub&s;tances which are not conductors of electricity, do not conduct the nervous fluid."</P>
<P N="3">"3<HI>dly,</HI> Non-conducting bodies, which acquire by heat the property of conducting electricity, pre&s;erve it likewi&s;e for the nervous fluid."</P>
<P N="4">"4<HI>thly,</HI> Cold at a certain degree, renders water a non-conductor of electricity, as well as of the nervous fluid."</P>
<P N="5">"5<HI>thly,</HI> The velocity of the nervous fluid is, as far as we can calculate, the &s;ame with that of electricity."</P>
<P N="6">"6<HI>thly,</HI> The ob&s;tacles which the nerves, under certain circum&s;tances, oppo&s;e to electricity, they pre&s;ent likewi&s;e to the nervous fluid."</P>
<P N="7">"7<HI>thly,</HI> Attraction is a property of the electric fluid, and this property has been di&s;covered in the nervous fluid."</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="028310_0469_0FD89B35B7FD6F60">Having enumerated and detailed the foregoing arguments, the Doctor, in an effu&s;ion of triumph, &s;ubjoins, "We here &s;ee the greate&s;t analogy be|tween the&s;e fluids; nay, I may even add, the cha|racters of their identity."</P>
<P>As an additional &s;upport to the &s;ame opinion, Dr Valli adduces the peculiar and &s;triking pheno|mena exhibited by the <HI>torpedo,</HI> the <HI>gymnotus elec|tricus,</HI> the <HI>&s;ilurus,</HI> &amp;c. which proceed, as he alleges, from a fluid in every re&s;pect the &s;ame with that which was di&s;covered in frogs, by the profe&s;&s;or of anatomy at Bologna. As the Doctor, however, has advanced nothing in confirmation of &s;uch entire &s;amene&s;s, &s;ave a certain remote analogy which he &s;ays he has di&s;covered between the mu&s;|cles of animals, and the <HI>electrical apparatus</HI> of the torpedo, the gymnotus, &amp;c. it is obvious that this latter argument will but very &s;lightly impre&s;s the philo&s;ophical phy&s;iologi&s;t, who founds his belief of principles on <HI>facts,</HI> rather than on vague and vi&s;ionary <HI>conjectures.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;atisfactorily a&s;cer|tained the identity of the <HI>nervous</HI> with the electric fluid, he next proceeds to &s;peculations on its in|fluence in the diver&s;ified movements and functions of the animal economy. To me, however, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the greater part of this &s;peculative inve&s;|tigation, appears to be rather the efferve&s;cent

effu&s;ions of an <HI>imagination,</HI> heated to exce&s;s in a favourite pur&s;uit, than the &s;olemn <HI>deci&s;ions</HI> of a tranquil and unbia&s;&s;ed <HI>under&s;tanding.</HI> I acknow|ledge my&s;elf unable, in many in&s;tances, to di&s;cern the nece&s;&s;ary nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s or affinity between his con|clu&s;ions, and the facts from which they are de|duced:&mdash;or perhaps I may &s;peak my &s;entiments more fully when I &s;ay, that the learned author appears not unfrequently to have &s;ub&s;tituted mere <HI>hypothetical allegations,</HI> for fair and logical <HI>conclu|&s;ions</HI>&mdash;the vacant re&s;ults of his own conjectures, for genuine principles developed by experiment, and a&s;certained by ob&s;ervation. It very often happens, that by attempting to embrace too much under a &s;ingle cau&s;e, we extend the tortured principle beyond its natural limits, and thus, to appearance, weaken or render doubtful its influ|ence, even on tho&s;e phenomena which it immedi|ately regards. This ob&s;ervation applies with too much propriety and force, to the &s;peculations of the indefatigable Valli. By attempting to explain <HI>all,</HI> he has in fact explained <HI>none,</HI> of the pheno|mena of the animal economy, by that &s;ubtle fluid on which he &s;o patiently experimented. Many of his phy&s;iological facts and &s;peculations are indeed ingenious and intere&s;ting, but, in my view, they are equally deducible from any other &s;eries of experi|ments, as from that by which they are preceded in the Doctor's publication. Many of the learned author's facts may be, no doubt, true and well
<PB N="228" REF="028310_0471_0FD89B38AFAAFCD8">
defined, and &s;ome of his principles and re&s;ults to a certain degree intere&s;ting to the phy&s;ician and philo&s;opher, but, taken in the aggregate, they are too di&s;jointed to con&s;titute any thing like a &s;y&s;tem, too di&s;connected to form a regular chain of inve&s;tigation. On my mind, his <HI>&s;peculations</HI> on the cau&s;es of <HI>mu&s;cular motion, &s;en&s;ation &s;ecre|tion</HI> and <HI>nutrition,</HI> impre&s;s no more &s;olid convic|tion than do <HI>tho&s;e</HI> of Stahl on the &s;ubject of his <HI>anima medica,</HI> of Van Helmont re&s;pecting his &s;ubtle <HI>Archeus,</HI> or of the airy Paracel&s;us with re|gard to his <HI>planetary influence.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding the apparent &s;everity of the foregoing ob&s;erva|tions, I am &s;till obliged to declare it as my opinion, that the novelty and importance of the &s;ubject on which Dr Valli has experimented and written, entitle his work to the particular atten|tion of the learned and ingenious of every na|tion.</P>
<P>For the want of &s;y&s;tem and requi&s;ite deci&s;ion in the writings of the preceding author, compen&s;ation is, in a great mea&s;ure, made by a &s;ub&s;equent pub|lication of the accurate and ingenious Fowler. The experiments and &s;peculations of this young philo&s;o|pher, on what he terms, the "<HI>influence di&s;covered by Galvani,</HI>" made their fir&s;t public appearance at Edinburgh, in the cour&s;e of the year 1793: they are not, indeed, &s;o numerous as tho&s;e of the Italian phy&s;ician, but they appear to have been
<PB N="229" REF="028310_0472_0FD89B3A3260ED48">
conceived with more de&s;ign, and executed with more judgment. Mr. Fowler &s;eems to have been among the fir&s;t who controverted the opinion of Galvani and Valli, re&s;pecting the identity of the nervous and electric fluids: and he has, doubtle&s;s, controverted it with ability and effect.</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler prelimina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es his ob&s;ervations, with a lucid and forcible &s;tatement of a certain previous combination of circum&s;tances, which he alleges, mu&s;t have &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mind of profe&s;&s;or Galvani, with a belief of the &s;amene&s;s of the pre|ceding fluids.</P>
<P>That &s;uch a prepo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ion mu&s;t have had, indeed, a powerful effect on the &s;ub&s;equent deductions and conclu&s;ions of the Profe&s;&s;or, will be readily ac|knowledged, by every one who has experienced the influence of preconceived opinions&mdash;an influ|ence pregnant with error, and leading countle&s;s evils in its train.</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler proceeds then to mention the fir&s;t object which engaged his attention, in the com|mencement of his intere&s;ting inquiry, and which appears well calculated to pave the way, for the more ea&s;y and effectual accompli&s;hment of his experimental cour&s;e. This, to make u&s;e of his own words, was, "to a&s;certain, as well the va|rious
<PB N="230" REF="028310_0473_0FD89B3DF44E26E8">
circum&s;tances, e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite to the production of the&s;e new phenomena, as tho&s;e in which they can be rendered mo&s;t obvious." The i&s;&s;ue of his enquiry on this &s;ubject, I will al&s;o lay before the reader in his own words. "After" &s;ays he, "a great variety of experiments, of which it would be unnece&s;&s;ary here, to relate more than the re&s;ult, I found, that I could not excite in an animal the appearances de&s;cribed by Galvani, with any &s;ub&s;tances whatever, whether &s;olid or fluid, except the metals: and that the mutual contact of two different metals with each other, &s;o far as I was able to determine, was in every ca&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to the effect."</P>
<P>After a &s;atisfactory attainment of this object, the ingenious author next proceeds to a judicious &s;eries of experiments, with a view to di&s;cover the genuine nature of the animal fluid, fir&s;t reali&s;ed by the fortunate profe&s;&s;or of Bologna. Of tho&s;e ex|periments he does not give us a minute &s;pecifica|tion, but only furni&s;hes &s;tatements of their mo&s;t obvious and &s;triking re&s;ults. The&s;e &s;tatements he al&s;o occa&s;ionally inter&s;per&s;es with intere&s;ting and important remarks, and &s;ome very ingenious &s;pe|culations.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed his &s;eries of experiments, (a &s;eries &s;ufficiently numerous and diver&s;ified for the
<PB N="231" REF="028310_0474_0FD89B402F1D7E30">
&s;tabli&s;hment of general principles) relative to the nature of the nervous fluid, and its affinity to the matter of electricity, Mr. Fowler at length favours us on this &s;ubject with the following conclu&s;ions, which I &s;hall take the liberty of pre&s;enting to the reader in the words of their ingenious anther.</P>
<P>After having &s;tated a few analogies between the animal fluid of Galvani, and that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>torpedo,</HI> he then rever&s;es the compari&s;on, and lays down &s;everal points of e&s;&s;ential difference, not only between the two preceding fluids, but al&s;o between the former of them, namely the fluid of Galvani, and the matter of electricity.</P>
<P>"This influence, (&s;ays he, referring to the nervous fluid of animals) differs, both from that of the torpedo, &amp;c. and from electricity, in pro|ducing no &s;en&s;ation (in man at lea&s;t) at all &s;imilar to that of an electrical &s;hock."</P>
<P>"&mdash;That &s;ome kind of di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation is occa&s;ioned by it, even in frogs, independent of that which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e from irritation and the contractions of their mu&s;cles, is evident from their re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and expre&s;&s;ions of unea&s;ine&s;s. In other animals, as I &s;hall afterwards have occa|&s;ion to &s;hew, the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are &s;till le&s;s equi|vocal: and in man we can a&s;certain both their
<PB N="232" REF="028310_0475_0FD885D2FA3D2630">
degree and their kind. That they differ con&s;ider|ably from &s;uch as are produced by electricity will be proved when I come to &s;peak of the effects of this influence upon our &s;en&s;es."</P>
<P>"But the mo&s;t important, and characteri&s;tic difference which I have yet been able to di&s;cover, between this new influence and electricity, con&s;i&s;ts in their effects upon the contractile power of animals and of plants. The contractions of ani|mals excited by electricity have a tendency to de&s;troy that power upon which contractions de|pend. But the contractions excited, by the appli|cation of the metals, have, in all my experiments, had the directly oppo&s;ite effect. The more fre|quently contractions have been in this way excited, the longer do they continue excitable: and the longer are the parts upon which &s;uch experiments are made, pre&s;erved from putridity. An influ|ence, capable of exciting contractions without occa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ioning exhau&s;tion, was a thing I &s;o little expected to find, and &s;o contrary to the character which had been given of this both by Galvani and by Doctor Valli, that I at fir&s;t di&s;tru&s;ted my own ob&s;ervation of the fact: but the number of comparative experiments which I had afterwards occa&s;ion to make, though with views different from that of a&s;certaining the point in que&s;tion, convinced me that this influence, &s;o far from
<PB N="233" REF="028310_0476_0FD89B41D859DB30">
de&s;troying the contractility of mu&s;cles, has a ten|dency to pre&s;erve it. Oxygene is, &s;o far as I know, the only &s;timulus in nature, who&s;e effects are at all analogous."</P>
<P>"When a frog has been long dead, I have been &s;ometimes more than a quarter of an hour without being able to excite a &s;ingle contraction by the application of the metals: but after this, without at all varying the means employed, con|tractions have appeared, and have become gradu|ally more and more vigorous."</P>
<P>"It is &s;aid (for I have never had an opportunity of making the experiment), that a &s;tream of elec|tricity, pa&s;&s;ed through a &s;en&s;itive plant, produces an almo&s;t immediate collap&s;e of its leaves. But the influence di&s;covered by Galvani produced no &s;uch effect in the following experiment. Having &s;eparated the leg of a frog from its body, I freed its crural nerves from &s;urrounding parts, and with one hand held it &s;upported upon the end of a probe. An a&s;&s;i&s;tant placed a piece of &s;ilver under its foot, and held the zinc with which it was to be touched. A &s;en&s;ative plant formed the medium of communication between us. He held the bot|tom of its &s;tem between his fingers, while I held the top; &s;o that when the &s;ilver was touched by the zinc, the influence pa&s;&s;ed up the plant, and
<PB N="234" REF="028310_0477_0FD89B46682851B8">
through the whole of its &s;tem. The frog's leg in&s;tantly contracted, and repeated its contractions every time the &s;ilver and zinc were brought in contact: but the leaves of the plant did not col|lap&s;e; neither did they when any of its branches formed part of the circuit."</P>
<P>I mu&s;t however, confe&s;s that the plant, upon which this experiment was made, had been kept through the winter. With a young one the re&s;ult might po&s;&s;ibly be different; but &s;uch an one I have not yet had in my power to procure.</P>
<P>"The torpedo does not appear at all affected by the influence which it&s;elf produces. Animals in which Galvani's phenomena are produced, are &s;trongly affected."</P>
<P>The very ingenious author pa&s;&s;es on next to report the re&s;ult of certain experiments which he in&s;tituted, in order to refute the opinion of tho&s;e, who allege, that the fluid of Galvani proceeds entirely from the metallic &s;ub&s;tances u&s;ed, and does not re&s;ide at all in any part of the animal &s;y&s;tem. In his enquiry re&s;pecting this point he di&s;plays the &s;ame fertility in devi&s;ing, the &s;ame &s;agacity in judging, and the &s;ame ingenuity in deducing, which &s;o forcibly impre&s;s the reader throughout every part of his experimental inve&s;ti|gation.
<PB N="235" REF="028310_0478_0FD89B4AB01AD5A8">
He al&s;o farther &s;hows, that the nervous influence of Galvani, and the &s;ubtle fluid of elec|tricity differ very materially from each other in the following particular, namely, that again&s;t the effects of the former, animals are able to guard them&s;elves by means of a certain voluntary e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er|tion, whereas the operation of the latter is not in the &s;malle&s;t degree &s;ubject to the controul or in|fluence of the will.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed the con&s;ideration of the <HI>nature,</HI> Mr. Fowler proceeds to make &s;ome u&s;eful <HI>appli|cations,</HI> of the influence di&s;covered by the profe&s;&s;or of anatomy at Bologna. In his attempts to &s;hed light on certain controverted points, and to &s;olve certain ab&s;tru&s;e que&s;tions, in phy&s;iology, by means of this fluid, he appears no le&s;s ingenious and &s;atisfactory than in the former parts of his enquiry.</P>
<P>He appears peculiarly happy and conclu&s;ive in his re&s;earches after the <HI>&s;ource</HI> from whence the nerves and mu&s;cles derive their re&s;pective powers. I beg leave to lay before the reader two of the author's experiments, in&s;tituted for the purpo&s;e of a&s;certaining this intere&s;ting particular&mdash;a particular which has &s;o long furni&s;hed a &s;ubject of contro|ver&s;y among &s;peculative phy&s;iologi&s;ts. The latter of the two experiments, (to which the former
<PB N="236" REF="028310_0479_0FD885D82933E5B8">
&s;erves only as a nece&s;&s;ary introduction) is of it&s;elf more than equal to all that has ever been ad|vanced on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>EXPERIMENT I.</P>
<P>"I divided (&s;ays Mr. Fowler) the &s;ciatic nerve of one leg, and tied the crural artery of the other in a large frog. Scarcely any blood was lo&s;t in doing either. Two days aft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this I &s;trangled it. During the fir&s;t 24 hours, the leg in which the nerve had been divided, appeared to contract with the mo&s;t vigour; after this period the difference between them became more doubtful; but the contractions were at no time &s;tronger in the leg who&s;e artery was tied, than in that who&s;e nerve was divided.</P>
<P>EXPERIMENT II.</P>
<P>"The &s;ame operations were performed upon a large female frog full of &s;pawn. Four hours afterwards &s;he was covered by a male, who had been treated in a &s;imilar manner. I mention this circum&s;tance, as it tends to prove, that the pain occa&s;ioned by the operation was probably not &s;o great as to produce much fallacy.</P>
<P>"On the day following, &s;he had &s;pawned, and on the &s;ixth day from the operations, &s;he was &s;trangled. When laid upon a plate of zinc, and
<PB N="237" REF="028310_0480_0FD89B4F6521AD20">
excited by means of a rod of &s;ilver, the contrac|tions were found extremely feeble in the leg who&s;e artery had been tied, and cea&s;ed altogether in about twenty-two hours after her death.</P>
<P>In the leg, who&s;e nerve had been divided, they appeared as vigorous as they u&s;ually are in legs to which no injury has been previou&s;ly done, and continued excitable upwards of two days after they had cea&s;ed to be &s;o in the other."</P>
<P>It may be proper on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion briefly to ob&s;erve, that the influence di&s;covered by Gal|vani was the te&s;t u&s;ed by Mr. Fowler to determine the exi&s;tence or ce&s;&s;ation of irritability in the mu&s;cles of the animals &s;ubjected to the preceding experiment. For this influence, as our author judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erves, appears to be indeed by far the be&s;t and mo&s;t delicate te&s;t that has ever yet been di&s;covered for a&s;certaining the lowe&s;t po&s;&s;ible degrees of mu&s;cular irritability. After having become wholly in&s;en&s;ible to the impre&s;&s;ions of all other &s;timuli, mu&s;cles &s;till continue to vibrate to the kindred touches of this &s;ubtle fluid, to which nature appears to have given them &s;uch a nice, and, perhaps I may &s;ay, &s;pecific corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>Mr. Fowler, after having tran&s;iently glanced on the &s;ubject of inflammation, pa&s;&s;es on to the
<PB N="238" REF="028310_0481_0FD89B53723B96B0">
attack of a phy&s;iological doctrine, propagated with zeal, and &s;upported with ability by that celebrated experimentali&s;t, the Abbe Fontana. The doctrine alluded to, embraces the exi&s;tence or re&s;idence of a certain vital principle in the volume of the blood. On this principle, as the indu&s;trious Abbe alleges, poi&s;ons produce their in&s;tantaneous effect, when introduced into the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tems of living animals. To all the different parts of this phy&s;ical <HI>doctrine</HI> I could never yet be induced to &s;ub&s;cribe, notwith&s;tanding the re&s;pectability of its learned and numerous advocates.</P>
<P>By attacking and vanqui&s;hing one of its mo&s;t powerful champions, Mr. Fowler has doubtle&s;s contributed much to its final demolition. For, in the conte&s;t now under our immediate con&s;ide|ration, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that to me the laurels of victory appear to be fairly wre&s;ted from the &s;ilvered temples of the <HI>Italian,</HI> and planted over the youthful brow of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>I have thus exhibited a view, &s;omewhat general indeed, though confe&s;&s;edly very &s;uccinct, of the re&s;ults laid down, and of the opinions entertained, by the ingenious Fowler, on the &s;ubject of the animal influence di&s;covered by Profe&s;&s;or Galvani. To lay before the reader a full account of all that is u&s;eful and important in the ob&s;ervations of this
<PB N="239" REF="028310_0482_0FD89B548869A020">
intere&s;ting author, would be to tran&s;cribe and re|print his whole publication.</P>
<P>The only productions in the Engli&s;h language, which this country now furni&s;hes, profe&s;&s;edly on the &s;ubject of the animal fluid di&s;covered by Gal|vani, are (as formerly ob&s;erved) tho&s;e of Fowler and Valli. On the comparative merit of tho&s;e two authors I will here take the liberty of advancing a few general, and, I flatter my&s;elf, impartial, ob&s;ervations:</P>
<P>The experiments of Doctor Valli are more numerous and pompous&mdash;tho&s;e of Mr. Fowler more definite and intelligible. The former author appears <HI>often,</HI> the latter, <HI>never,</HI> to have experi|mented without &s;ome determinate end in view. The experiments of the Italian may be compared to the promi&s;cuous plants of the fore&s;t, &s;trewn at random by the &s;portive and irregular hand of nature&mdash;tho&s;e of the young Briton, to choice and valuable collections, arranged with order and elegance, in a well regulated and beautiful garden. The experiments of Valli appear to throw into <HI>&s;hade,</HI> tho&s;e of Fowler into <HI>light,</HI> the objects which they immediately regard. From the for|mer, the reader collects information with diffi|culty, from the latter, without labour or painful attention.</P>

Valli is more diffu&s;e and often hypothetical&mdash;Fowler more pointed and generally conclu&s;ive. Valii appears to give loo&s;ened reins to a glowing imagination&mdash; Fowler to be con&s;tantly under the &s;teady guidance of a powerful and well-cultivated under&s;tanding. The former makes a greater di&s;play of learning, and, therefore, too frequently views objects through the more ob&s;cure <HI>media</HI> of previous publications&mdash;the latter exhibits a higher degree of ingenuity, and derives the principal part of his information, not from pages, &s;anctioned only by the names of celebrated, yet fallible, authors, but from the great <HI>folio</HI>-volume of <HI>nature,</HI> impre&s;&s;ed with her own &s;ignature. On the whole, Valli has experimented and written in the mo&s;t lengthy and profu&s;e&mdash;Fowler in the mo&s;t definite and conclu&s;ive manner. In many parts of the writings of the former, nothing el&s;e than the <HI>fiat</HI> of an almighty genius would be able to bring <HI>order</HI> out of <HI>confu&s;ion</HI>&mdash;in tho&s;e of the latter, lucidity, con|nection, and regularity, &s;hine pre-eminent through almo&s;t every page.</P>
<P>Having thus, without re&s;erve, delivered my &s;entiments on the <HI>publications of others,</HI> I hope I may be allowed to tre&s;pa&s;s on the reader's attention
<PB N="241" REF="028310_0484_0FD885DAAD1E1838">
while I make a few ob&s;ervations relating to <HI>my own.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing could have induced me thus ha&s;tily to for&s;ake the humble, but &s;ecure, retreats of ob&s;cu|rity, and ri&s;k my&s;elf before the eye of the world in the hazardous character of an author, &s;ave a &s;olicitous wi&s;h to contribute to the advancement of medical &s;cience, and thus aid in acquiring for man a more effectual exemption from mi&s;ery and pain. I &s;aw with regret the literary trea&s;ures of a Blumenbach concealed from the view of my fellow-citizens beneath the drapery of an ancient and an ob&s;olete language. I was anxiou&s;ly de&s;irous to &s;ee the phy&s;iological &s;y&s;tem of that illu&s;trious character completely clothed in the language of my country. I engaged in the tran&s;|lation of this work, not becau&s;e I conceived my|&s;elf better qualified for its execution than others, but becau&s;e others appeared to me unpardonably remi&s;s with regard to the undertaking. The execution proved laborious and difficult beyond my expectations. The difficulty of detecting an author's preci&s;e meaning through the du&s;ky medium of a Latin expre&s;&s;ion, can be fully under|&s;tood and reali&s;ed only by him who has made the arduous experiment.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="028310_0485_0FD885E5A70D67F0">Even after the ideas and opinions in the original are fully embraced and completely comprehended, another difficulty of no &s;mall magnitude &s;till remains, namely, to convey them to the reader with unequivocal definitude, through the indefinite medium of a different language. It is well known how extremely liable we are to mi&s;apprehend the preci&s;e meaning of an author who even writes in our own vernacular tongue, much more &s;o of one who publi&s;hes in a language but little u&s;ed in con|ver&s;ation, and, at be&s;t, but imperfectly under&s;tood by any man living.</P>
<P>Should the foregoing tran&s;lation ever fall into the hands of the celebrated profe&s;&s;or of Geottingen, I hope he will receive, with candour and indul|gence, a well meant attempt to extend the empire of his utility and his fame, by increa&s;ing the number of his admiring readers. If the tran&s;la|tion be in any part erroneous, in any part defi|cient, &s;trictures and corrections will be thankfully received, and punctually attended to in a &s;econd edition of the work, &s;hould a &s;econd be demanded by a patroni&s;ing public.</P>
<P>To pre&s;erve as far as po&s;&s;ible the firm and energetic &s;pirit which characterizes the writings of the illu&s;trious profe&s;&s;or of Goettingen, and to

convey to my readers the facts, the principles, the &s;peculations, and the opinions contained in his original work, without even the &s;hadow of altera|tion, diminution, or addition, has been my &s;teady and uniform aim throughout the whole of the foregoing tran&s;lation. Owing, however, to the different <HI>con&s;titutions</HI> or <HI>idioms,</HI> as they are more generally termed, of the Latin and Engli&s;h lan|guages, my tran&s;lation is in many places far&mdash;very far from being &s;trictly literal. <HI>Phra&s;eology</HI> I con|&s;ider, at be&s;t, as the mere trappings or drapery of <HI>compo&s;ition,</HI> while <HI>facts</HI> and <HI>principles</HI> con&s;titute its more &s;ub&s;tantial and important part. To pre&s;erve the latter, therefore, inviolate, and to communicate them with the utmo&s;t definitude, is the indi&s;pen|&s;ible duty of a tran&s;lator, from a principle of ju&s;tice to the original author, to the public, and to him&s;elf; but in my opinion, he is not bound, by any principle whatever, to make an entire &s;acrifice of all <HI>elegance</HI> and <HI>beauty,</HI> to mere puncti|lious <HI>literality</HI> of expre&s;&s;ion. Impre&s;&s;ed with the propriety and truth of the&s;e &s;entiments, I have, throughout the whole of the foregoing work, been &s;ometimes <HI>literal</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>free,</HI> accordingly as the one or the other mode of tran&s;lation gave birth to a phra&s;eology or &s;tile mo&s;t agreeable to my ear, and mo&s;t accordant to the &s;pirit of the original compo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="028310_0487_0FD89B6674222160">With re&s;pect to the appendix it&s;elf, it may not be ami&s;s to make it the &s;ubject of a few tran&s;ient ob&s;ervations. The <HI>principle</HI> which the&s;e additi|onal pages regard, and are intended to commu|nicate, is ju&s;tly becoming, among medical philo&s;o|phers, an object of primary importance. This principle opens to the view of the &s;peculative mind a rich and &s;pacious field, never yet printed, &s;ave by the adventurous &s;teps of a few pre-eminently active and enterpri&s;ing phy&s;iologi&s;ts&mdash;A field, the &s;alutary fruits of which will, no doubt, at a future day, &s;erve to elucidate the nature, to develope the compo&s;ition, and to alleviate the complicated mi&s;ery of man.</P>
<P>My whole de&s;ign in this appendix is to give a conden&s;ed, but &s;omewhat general view, of this principle or influence di&s;covered by profe&s;&s;or Gal|vani.</P>
<P>By far the greater number of medical charac|ters in the immen&s;e tract of country embraced within the limits of the <HI>United States,</HI> are, in con|&s;equence of their di&s;tances from literary in&s;titu|tions, excluded from acce&s;s to public libraries, and &s;ituated quite beyond the free circulation of phy&s;ical &s;cience. To &s;uch my appendix will &s;erve the humble purpo&s;e of a <HI>literary chronicle;</HI> it will convey to them a brief account of the di&s;coveries
<PB N="245" REF="028310_0488_0FD89B67EC4FDB58">
which are now going forward in the delightful and important &s;cience of phy&s;iology.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of the influence di&s;covered by Galvani I have my&s;elf in&s;tituted and performed a con&s;iderable number of experiments <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>That the reader may be acquainted with an ea&s;y, cheap and familiar method of experimenting on this &s;ubject, with|out having his feelings hurt by the agonizing pangs of tor|tured and dying animals, I will here take the liberty of in|&s;erting, in form of notes, a few extracts taken from a com|munication tran&s;mitted to Mr. Fowler, by his learned friend Mr. Robi&s;on, profe&s;&s;or of natural philo&s;ophy in the univer|&s;ity of Edinburgh.</P>
<P N="1">I. "I find (&s;ays the profe&s;&s;or) that if a piece of zinc be applied to the tongue, and be in contact with a piece of &s;il|ver, which touches any part of the lining of the mouth, no&s;trils, ears, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rethra, or anus, the &s;en&s;ation re&s;embling ta&s;te is felt on the tongue. If the experiment be inverted, by ap|plying the &s;ilver to the tongue, the irritation produced by the zinc is not &s;en&s;ible, except in the mouth and the urethra, and is very flight.</P>
<P N="2">II. "If the zinc (finely poli&s;hed) be applied to the ball of the eye, the brightne&s;s of the fla&s;h &s;eems to corre&s;pond with the &s;urface of contact of the &s;ilver with the tongue, palate, fauces, or cheek. The &s;ame thing happens when the &s;ilver is applied to the eye."</P>
<P N="3">III. "When a rod of zinc and one of &s;ilver are applied to the roof of the mouth, as far back as po&s;&s;ible, the irrita|tions produced by bringing their outer ends into contact, are very &s;trong, and that by the zinc re&s;embles ta&s;te, in the &s;ame manner as when applied to the tongue."</P>
<P N="4">IV. "I had been paring my toe nails with &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and had cut off a con&s;iderable portion of the thick &s;kin, &s;o that the blood began to <HI>ooze</HI> through in the middle of the wound. I applied the zinc there, and an exten&s;ive &s;urface of &s;ilver to the tongue. Every time I brought the metals into con|tact, I felt a &s;mart irritation by the zinc at the wound," &amp;c.</P>
<P>A variety of other experiments of a &s;imilar nature are contained in the &s;ame communication from Mr. Robi&s;on to Mr. Fowler; but a further detail of them I conceive un|nece&s;&s;ary, as the ingenious reader, being acquainted with the foregoing, can with facility devi&s;e other experiments for him&s;elf. Thus I have frequently conveyed to my eye the luminous fla&s;h mentioned by Mr. Robi&s;on, not only from the internal ve&s;tments of the mouth, the no&s;e, the ure|thra, &amp;c. but al&s;o from between my fingers, from the cu|bital flexure of my arm, and from various other parts of my body, where the texture of the cuticle and &s;kin is more fine and &s;oft than ordinary; always taking care, however, to moi&s;ten the part previou&s;ly to the application of the metals.</P></NOTE>; &s;ome of

my re&s;ults have appeared &s;triking and new, but my experiments have been neither &s;ufficiently nume|rous nor varied to warrant the deduction and e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of general principles. My pre&s;ent in|tention is (&s;hould heaven indulge me in life and health), to pro&s;ecute to &s;ome extent this highly

intere&s;ting &s;ubject. Should my inve&s;tigation be favoured with the di&s;covery of any thing curious in &s;cience, or u&s;eful in practice, a detail of it may be expected in a future communication.</P>
<P>To my &s;olemn audit before the bar of the pub|lic, I now ha&s;ten in tremulous anxiety, "with all my imperfections on my head,"&mdash;imperfections which will no doubt awaken the cen&s;ure of the critic, but receive, I flatter my&s;elf, the indulgence of the liberal and candid. The approbation of the former I neither court nor regard; that of the latter it &s;hall be my con&s;tant ambition to de|&s;erve. The profe&s;&s;ed bu&s;ine&s;s of mo&s;t modern critics appears to be, to condemn&mdash;promi&s;cuou&s;ly condemn, too frequently without the fainte&s;t &s;ha|dow of either inclination or talents to di&s;criminate merit from its rever&s;e.</P>
<P>In my view the <HI>approbation</HI> of a profe&s;&s;ed critic is perfectly &s;ynonymous with the <HI>cen&s;ure</HI> of the liberal and the ingenious, to who&s;e candid exami|nation the preceding pages are &s;ubmitted with all that re&s;pect and deference due from an inexperi|enced writer.</P>
