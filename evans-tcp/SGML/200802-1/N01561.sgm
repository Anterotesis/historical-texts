<P>IN a Country of much Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s, and where the <HI>Silver</HI> (which is the be&s;t <HI>Medium</HI>) is drawn off, the Trade will thereby be greatly di&s;ad|vantaged. To &s;upply the Deficiency thereof in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Country, the Publick <HI>Bills of Credit</HI> have been fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome Years a u&s;eful Expedient; but they being be|come &s;carce, and daily decrea&s;ing, various have been the Projections of &s;etting up a <HI>Bank</HI> to the value of 200000 <HI>l.</HI> more or le&s;s, as the only <HI>Medium</HI> of Trade.</P>
<P>Before the Con&s;ideration of the &s;everal Projecti|ons, it may be of u&s;e to con&s;ider, that before the War, 26 or 27 Years &s;ince, there was a competent Ca&s;h to an&s;wer the Trade of the Country; and to enquire what it was that drew it in, and how it comes to pa&s;s tis now drawn out; that &s;o the fir&s;t may be encouraged, and the other avoided.</P>
<P>And tho' the Wrecks and the Privateers did bring in con&s;iderable Quantities, yet many are of the Opinion tho&s;e were but a &s;mall Proportion to the runing Ca&s;h of the Country; but that the Fi&s;hery was then the <HI>N. E. Silver Mine,</HI> and if Peace conti|nue, may prove the principal Means to draw in <HI>Silver</HI> again; and &s;o much the more, if it has all needful Encouragement given by the <HI>General Court.</HI> For tho' tis true the needle&s;s Expence in many re&s;pects, as in <HI>Silks, fine Cloth,</HI> both <HI>Linen</HI> and <HI>Woollen,</HI> as al&s;o the Drinking &s;o much <HI>Wine</HI> &amp; <HI>Rum,</HI> &amp;c. has been a great means of carrying off the
<PB N="4" REF="001855_0003_0FB91D7A1AF91338">
<HI>Silver,</HI> yet this is a Toppick ea&s;ier to &s;peak to, than to redre&s;s; &amp; is a Matter worthy of the Legi&s;lators care. And if the <HI>General Court</HI> &s;hould lend upon good Security, and without Intere&s;t, (only paying for the making) great Sums of Bills for inabling Particular Men to carry on any u&s;eful and beneficial Works, and &s;hould give to others &s;ufficient to Encourage them to &s;et up u&s;eful and profitable Inventions or Trades, it would be not only &s;ome addition to the Running Ca&s;h, but al&s;o would prevent much of our Importation. And Encouragement to our Fi&s;hery would much increa&s;e our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="7 letters">tion, whereby in time, the Difficulties we now labour under, would be abated. For till our Exportation exceeds our Importation, if <HI>Silver</HI> &s;hould happen to be brought into th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">untry, it could not abide here, but of nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t be again Exported to pay the Debt contracted. But as a needful Expedient, and while other Methods can be taken, (the Country Bills failing, and &s;hortning every Day more and more) &s;everal have been the Projections of Banks to &s;up|ply the Defect.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t propo&s;ed, is a <HI>Private Bank</HI>; wherein a number of Men, of good Real E&s;tates, entering their Names, and Sub&s;cribing for any Sum proporti|onable to the Security they can give in Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> take out perhaps half the Sum Sub&s;cribed for, pay|ing <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> for what they take out; the re&s;t of the Bills to be let out to &s;uch as will hire the &s;ame upon good Security; a part of the whole <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> to be to Publick U&s;es, the re&s;t to the <HI>Bankers</HI>; He
<PB N="5" REF="001855_0003_0FB91D7A1AF91338">
that Sub&s;cribes mo&s;t to have mo&s;t Voices, &s;o that one Man may have 5 Votes in all Matters, with many other Articles.</P>
<P>This <HI>Bank</HI> &s;eems projected more for the Advan|tage of the <HI>Bankers,</HI> than for the <HI>Publick Good</HI>: For (not to mention many other Objections) till we can be a&s;&s;ured that not only the pre&s;ent <HI>Bankers,</HI> but al&s;o their Po&s;terity, will always &s;eek the <HI>Publick</HI> above their own <HI>Private Advantage</HI>; What A&s;&s;urance can there be, that tho&s;e Gentlemen of 5 Votes a-piece, will not by joyning together, ea&s;ily &s;way the Votes to their own Advantage; as by drawing out of great Sums to Monopoli&s;e not only Goods, but Pro|vi&s;ions; with many other ways ruinous to the <HI>Pub|lick</HI>?</P>
<P>The &s;econd Projection is; That the Country Emit <HI>Bills</HI> and let them out upon <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> and upon good Security, which will bring in a large Revenue towards the &s;upport of the Charges of the Govern|ment.</P>
<P>This has likewi&s;e met with Objections; and till the <HI>Throne</HI> can be &s;ecured from a Prince of Arbitrary Principles in all times to come, &s;uch a <HI>Bank</HI> will be dangerous: For how ea&s;y will it be for &s;uch a <HI>Prince</HI> to divert &s;uch a large Revenue to his U&s;e and Plea|&s;ure? If any think otherwi&s;e, they may con&s;ider the la&s;t 5 Reigns, and &s;ee if they can a&s;&s;ure us, that any more than one of them would not have taken hold of &s;uch an Opportunity: For tho' (thanks be to Heaven) we have a King upon the Throne, that Studies nothing more than the welfare of his Peo|ple,
<PB N="6" REF="001855_0004_0FB91D7B96D7EA68">
yet all Men are Mortal, and as Changes have been in our Kindom of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o no doubt may be again; and if a Prince of &s;uch Principles &s;hould ever A&s;cend the Throne, all the Laws of &s;ecure &s;o large a Revenue, would prove but as <HI>Spiders Webs.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e two <HI>Banks</HI> which are level'd to rai&s;e a large Income yearly, which mu&s;t al&s;o have many Officers, and a large Pen&s;ion for their Service, are recipro|cally oppo&s;ed by both; neither of the two Parties, but can &s;ee danger in the others obtaining their ends.</P>
<P>A third Propo&s;al has been, That the Country &s;hould make a competent Sum of <HI>Publick Bills,</HI> and lend them to the &s;everal Towns in proportion to their <HI>Rates,</HI> at 5 <HI>per Cent</HI> for 20 Years, in which time the whole being paid in, the Principal to be to &s;uch <HI>Town,</HI> who may either let it out upon <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> or purcha&s;e Lands with it for the u&s;e of the Town.</P>
<P>This third Propo&s;al being without the Charge of great Officers and Salaries, and without the ri&s;que of <HI>bad Bills,</HI> or <HI>Cheats,</HI> yet an&s;wering the end pro|po&s;ed of &s;upplying a Medium of Trade, and having none of the former Objections lying again&s;t it, may rea&s;onably be accounted the mo&s;t eligible, &amp; every way preferable, rather than any of the two former, or than that of framing a new <HI>Specie</HI> of <HI>Bills</HI> founded upon the Mortgaged Lands; and all the Country's undivided Lands, which &s;o long as any of tho&s;e <HI>Bills</HI> were out, would bar the Country from &s;ettling one Town more; and (without the Country's Sanction) would involve the People in new Perplexities how to pay their Specialties for <HI>Province Bills.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001855_0004_0FB91D7B96D7EA68">And it being &s;uppo&s;ed, that many that are rather for no <HI>Bank,</HI> yet joyn in &s;ome with one &s;ide, &s;ome with the other, in order to ob&s;truct emiting of any; as be&s;t &s;uiting their particular Intere&s;t: In which ca&s;e a Fourth has been propo&s;ed, (<HI>viz.</HI>) A <HI>Private Bank,</HI> of a competent Number of Men in Bu&s;ine&s;s agreeing together, make <HI>Bills,</HI> &amp; give Security each to other to an&s;wer them; to let their Books lie open for any Man in the Province to Sub&s;cribe his Sum; and giving in Security &s;ufficient, to take out what <HI>Bills</HI> he Sub&s;cribes for, without paying any <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> only at taking out, to pay for the making, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to be obliged in &s;ome Penalty to meet once a Year, and pay off the nece&s;&s;ary Charge, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> till a com|petent Ca&s;h be taken out, and then the Books to be &s;hut up, and no more <HI>Bills</HI> Emitted, &s;ave only to change the defective, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Such a <HI>Bank</HI> might be very U&s;eful as a Medium of Trade, and would &s;oon obtain in this Province, to be as good as the <HI>Bills</HI> of the other Colonies.</P>
<P>'Tis certain, <HI>Banks</HI> of what kind &s;oever, cannot be (in our declining Circum&s;tances) a compleat Re|medy, but only may render us more Comfortable in our con&s;uming Condition; as a Cordial to a Man in in a deadly Di&s;ea&s;e, may be &s;ome Support till other Means can be u&s;ed; for which Rea&s;on 'tis preferable to all <HI>Banks,</HI> that the Government Emit large Sums for promoting what may be Beneficial and of a general Good; (<HI>ut &s;up.</HI>) which will not only be a Supply of pre&s;ent Ca&s;h, but will al&s;o lay certain and &s;table Foundations of increa&s;ing the Produce of
<PB N="8" REF="001855_0005_0FB91D80166229E0">
the Country; which is the Intere&s;t and Wi&s;dom of all Nations.</P>
<P>Such as lending large Sums upon good Security, without <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> for &s;ome Term of Years, (only pay|ing for the making) for building a Bridge over <HI>Charles</HI> River, cutting a Channel at <HI>Sandwich</HI> for &s;afe and more &s;peedy Pa&s;&s;age of Ve&s;&s;els, if tho&s;e Works upon Mature Con&s;ideration &s;hall be found Practicable. And here being both <HI>Iron Oar,</HI> and a plenty of Wood to work it, and this Country hav|ing great occa&s;ion for all &s;orts of Iron Work; it may be advi&s;able to advance con&s;iderably in <HI>Bills,</HI> either by the way of <HI>Loan</HI> or <HI>Gift,</HI> to &s;uch as will undertake to &s;et up a <HI>Finery,</HI> and cau&s;e it to Work to Effect; which would work the <HI>Iron</HI> better, and in greater Quantities; and by the help of which, <HI>Pots</HI> &amp; <HI>Kettles</HI> might be made here for the u&s;e of the Country. To encourage which, the Duty laid in <HI>England</HI> upon Hollow Ware, would have no &s;mall Influence. True it is, here was a <HI>Finery</HI> in the beginning of Times at <HI>Lynn,</HI> which did not pro&s;per, here not being then a competent Number of People to manage them, nor yet to take off the Wares when made, tho' at half the Price now &s;old at. It ought not to be any Di&s;|couragement in the Undertaking, now both the quantity of Hands to work at it, as al&s;o to expend the Goods when made, are double; the Price they then were at, being al&s;o doubled.</P>
<P>And here being great occa&s;ion for <HI>Nails,</HI> &amp; other &s;mall Works, which at pre&s;ent cannot be made at the price for want of a Slitting Mill, to &s;lit the <HI>Iron</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="001855_0005_0FB91D80166229E0">
into &s;uitable Rods; (for it is found that 'tis as much Labour to fit the Rods, as to make the Nails when the Rod is prepared) If the Country &s;hould give or lend a competent Sum to any that &s;hall procure Workmen to bring &s;uch a Mill to work to Effect here, it would inable the <HI>Smiths</HI> to make a &s;ufficient Supply of <HI>Nails</HI> for this Country. And if the Sol|diers at the Ca&s;tle had <HI>Nailers</HI> to in&s;truct them, many of them might be imployed in it, which would be a benefit to &s;uch Soldiers in their Health. This one Article of <HI>Iron-works,</HI> which might be &s;et upon for a few Hundreds, would &s;oon &s;ave the Country &s;ome Thou&s;ands in a Year.</P>
<P><HI>Gla&s;s-works</HI> might al&s;o be improved here, the Ma|terials being all at hand, which in its &s;everal parts, as <HI>Window-Gla&s;s, Beer-Gla&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Bottles,</HI> would amount to a very great Sum; and a &s;mall Encou|ragement from the Country, would be &s;ufficient to &s;et it up here. The like may be &s;aid of <HI>Paper</HI> mak|ing, working upon <HI>Horn</HI> for <HI>Combs, Ink-Horns,</HI> &amp;c. which with Encouragement, would &s;ave the Coun|try very Con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The improving the &s;owing of <HI>Hemp</HI> and <HI>Flax,</HI> is al&s;o a Matter worthy of great Regard; &amp; is much ob&s;tructed by the inability of many to break up Land &s;uitable. In which ca&s;e, it would be a good Encou|ragement to lend them without <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> &s;uch a Sum as may inable them yearly to break up and Fence in 10 or 20 Acres for that U&s;e. This would be of very great Service to the Country.</P>
<P>And tho' the Crown will always have a jealous
<PB N="10" REF="001855_0006_0FB91D8965222250">
Eye upon any Increa&s;e of the <HI>Woollen</HI> Manufactury here; yet it will rather Encourage the working upon <HI>Linen</HI> or upon <HI>Cotton,</HI> (as in <HI>Ireland</HI>) which with &s;uit|able Encouragement, is capable of a va&s;t Improve|ment here, by making <HI>Sheeting, Shirting,</HI> &amp; <HI>Callicoes.</HI></P>
<P>This Country being often liable upon a failure of Crops, to be bro't to Extremity for want of Grain; and when a time of Plenty comes, there are but few Buyers, whereby 'tis often run down below a rea|&s;onable Price: To prevent both which Extreams, the erecting of Store-hou&s;es or Graineries, would be of &s;ingular U&s;e: And if the Country advance &s;ome Thou&s;ands for building of Graineries, for &s;afe lay|ing up of Grain, many in a time of Plenty, would lay up their Grain in them; and taking a Receit for it may with it pay their Debts. (As is practi&s;ed in <HI>Germany</HI>) It is ea&s;y to conceive, that this would be a very great Benefit to Trade, and that which <HI>Holland,</HI> tho' they have comparatively but little Grain growing, yet hereby are inabled in times of Scar&s;ity, to &s;upply not only them&s;elves, but al&s;o the Neigh|bouring Nations.</P>
<P>Tho' this Country be large, and much good Land in it, which for want of People, cannot be improved in many Generations; yet a &s;hame it is to &s;ay, This Colony cannot provide them&s;elves nece&s;&s;ary Food.</P>
<P>The Town of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> much increa&s;ed of late Years, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> but the Country has not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">: But in &s;tead of that, many are gone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> following them, &s;o that 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> la&s;t 12 Years enough have
<PB N="11" REF="001855_0006_0FB91D8965222250">
gone out of this Colony, to Plant 12 good Towns in <HI>Connecticut</HI> only; be&s;ides what have gone to other Places. The rea&s;on of the not improving the Country more, and al&s;o many going out, when here is want of double the Number we have, is a Matter worthy to be well con&s;idered.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Setling this Country, Land was ea&s;y to be attained, and at a low price, which was an Inducement to multitudes to come over Servants: But now the Land being &s;o generally taken up, few come over that can live el&s;ewhere; &s;o that Servants now brought, generally prove Run-aways, Thieves, or &s;ome way Di&s;orderly: To avoid having of &s;uch, multitudes have rather cho&s;en to get Slaves, tho' at exce&s;&s;ive Price; which Practice, tho &s;o directly again&s;t the Peopling the Country, is encouraged in &s;tead of being remedied, even by the Laws of the Country. For he that is able to purcha&s;e a Slave, comes off in the Rates cheaper than his poorer Neighbour that has an Apprentice: tho' indeed in that hard and un|equal Tax of <HI>Polemoney,</HI> the Ma&s;ters are made equal. But he that has an Apprentice, mu&s;t pay more for him, than his richer Neighbour is &s;et at for his Slave; &amp; the poor Man's Apprentice mu&s;t Watch &amp; Train, and not only &s;o, but in a time of War, mu&s;t be Pre&s;t from him: All which his richer Neighbour is clear|ed from, be&s;ides his paying le&s;s in the Rates; to the encouraging of Slavery, and di&s;couraging of the Poor; and con&s;equently to the putting a full &s;top to the Growth of the Country: Slaves being a weak|ning rather than Addition to the Strength of a
<PB N="12" REF="001855_0007_0FB91D8EC4EF5228">
Country. <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> alone is &s;uppo&s;ed to have 3 or 400 Slaves; which were there &s;o many Servants in their &s;tead, enough would come out of their time yearly, to people a good Town.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the Hindrances of the Increa&s;e of the Country; for Remedy whereof, it is humbly Propo&s;ed, That the Country make &s;uch Provi&s;ion, that Servants when out of their time, &s;hall be entitu|led to 50 or 60 Acres of Land, &amp; a Town&s;hip appoin|ted for them; and if others &s;hall joyn with them in &s;ettling &s;uch Town, they to pay to the Country a moderate Price for Land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;uch Town&s;hip not to exceed 4 or 5 Miles Square; for the extravegant Bounds of Town&s;hips, is that which has occa&s;ioned great Quarrels among them&s;elves, and al&s;o given a great deal of Trouble to the <HI>General Court</HI> about pla|cing new <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;es,</HI> and the Bounds of Pre|cincts. And &s;uch Town&s;hip (if it may be) to have a Brook or River in it, proper for a <HI>Gri&s;t-Mill</HI> and a <HI>Saw-Mill,</HI> the <HI>Meeting-Hou&s;e</HI> to be &s;et in the middle of the Town&s;hip, and the Hou&s;es as near as may be to it. And as &s;oon as &s;uch Town&s;hip is filled up with Inhabitants, then to appoint another. And this would be the greate&s;t Inducement to the coming over of Servants, and the greate&s;t Means of Increa|&s;ing and Strengthening the Country.</P>
<P>To effect which, if tho&s;e Gentlemen that have In|gro&s;t va&s;t Tracts of Land, without any de&s;ign ever to &s;ettle them by them&s;elves, Servants or Slaves, &s;hould Voluntarily thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> up into the Country's Hands, one half of what may have &s;o Ingro&s;t, in
<PB N="13" REF="001855_0007_0FB91D8EC4EF5228">
order to furni&s;h Conveniences for &s;uch Settlements, they might be gainers by it in the other half.</P>
<P>Or if the Country &s;hould put a Rate upon &s;uch Tracts of Land as lie convenient to &s;ettle Town|&s;hips upon, in order to make them willing to throw them up to the Country; &s;uch yearly Rate would be more Ju&s;tifiable, and more Equal, than to Rate a poor Man 10 <HI>s.</HI> that has much ado to live; tho&s;e E&s;tates being valued worth <HI>hundreds of Pounds</HI> by the Owners thereof, who keep them only in hopes that as other Places hereafter &s;hall be &s;ettled, they may Advance upon the Price, yet Pay no Rates for them: And in the mean time their poor Neighbours mu&s;t pay perhaps a greater Rate than would be put upon him in the mo&s;t Arbitrary Kingdom in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Either of the&s;e two ways, with what Lands remain yet in the Country's Di&s;po&s;e, would &s;oon furni&s;h Land &s;ufficient to &s;upply Servants as they &s;hall be|come Free, and &s;upply others that they need not withdraw, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But if neither of the&s;e two Me|thods &s;hould be approved of, If the Country &s;hould Enact, <HI>That as often as there &s;hould be occa&s;ion, a conve|nient Town&s;hip be lookt out and Survey'd, and made &s;ure to them, and &s;uch others as &s;hall joyn with them, they after &s;ome Years to pay a quit Rent, in &s;ome Proportion to the former Value of the Land, to the Owners thereof when they &s;hall have made out their Claims</HI>; This would be &s;o far from being a Damage, that it would be a Be|nefit to &s;uch Owners of Lands, by having an In|come of that which if the former Methods continue, can hardly ever be &s;ettled.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="001855_0008_0FB91D9456808F20">Some that are good Farmers, who ob&s;erving that the Lands are &s;o generally Ingro&s;t, fear they &s;hall not procure &s;ufficient to &s;ettle their Children upon, have &s;traitned them|&s;elves, and perhaps run in debt to buy Land, to the di&s;abling them to improve the Lands they before had. For inabling &s;uch to improve their Lands, if the Country &s;hould lend 100 <HI>l.</HI> without Intere&s;t, upon Condition that in ten Years time they break up and keep &s;ubdued 50 Acres of Land; this would be a great Encouragement to them, and would much Increa&s;e the Produce of the Country.</P>
<P>And as to Slaves, as was before Demon&s;trated, they are a great hinderance to the Peopling and Improving the Country: And the Proverb tells us, That <HI>the Receiver is as bad as the Thief</HI>; and <HI>that if there were no Receivers, there would be no Thieves</HI>: If tho&s;e are true <HI>Proverbs,</HI> then are not we of this Country guilty of that Violence, Treachery and Blood&s;hed, that is daily made u&s;e of to obtain them; we rendring our &s;elves Partakers with them in that Wickedne&s;s? (For 'tis not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the&s;e do voluntarily abandon them&s;elves to be carried into a Foreign Country, and there to be &s;old for Slaves) If therefore the Country in &s;tead of many Laws they have made obout <HI>Negroes,</HI> &s;hould Enact, That twenty Years hence there &s;hould be no Slave in the Country, it would hurt no Man, but would greatly Encourage Servants to come, and nece&s;&s;itate their being brought over, to the great Increa&s;e and Strengthning the Country.</P>
<P>And now if any &s;hall object to what is &s;aid, in order to better the Propo&s;als, for advancing the general Good of the Country; or &s;hall add mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch better Rea&s;ons to Enforce what may be &s;aid, they would therein do good Service to their Country.</P>
<P>But if they Object with de&s;ign to hinder the Improve|ments hinted at, from private and &s;ecret Views of their own, however they may e&s;teem of them&s;elves, are far from being true Friends to the Country. All wi&s;e civilized Nations make it a principal Part of their Care to Encourage the Pro|duce of their &s;everal Countries, that &s;o they may &s;tand in need of the le&s;s from abroad,</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="001855_0008_0FB91D9456808F20">And it being agreed upon on all hands, that a Medium is wanting, and the <HI>General Court</HI> having pitch'd upon the Sum of 100000 <HI>l.</HI> to be Made and Emitted; The Que&s;tion is, Whether it be be&s;t for the General Good, to inve&s;t all or Part of &s;aid Sum in the &s;everal Towns in Proportion; and with the remainder, or with other Money lent, (for 100000 <HI>l.</HI> will be found too &s;mall a Sum) free of Intere&s;t, to Particular Men, to be for the Advance of Husbandry, and bringing in of Arts and Trades that may be of va&s;t Be|nefit to the Country (<HI>ut &s;up.</HI>)?</P>
<P>Or whether it be be&s;t to let it out to Intere&s;t to our Ne|ce&s;&s;itous Neighbours, and thereby rai&s;e a large Revenue?</P>
<P>For An&s;wer, Can it be thought, that a little U&s;e-Money &s;hould be a greater Benefit to the Country, than any or all the various Methods hinted at, or that might be thought of? One Branch of which, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that of breaking up of Land, and Improvements thereon, or that other Branch of Iron|work. would Yearly &s;ave the Country much more than all the U&s;e-Money could amount to, (were it to come clear of all Charges.)</P>
<P>Or can it be conceived, that a Committee, tho' well cho&s;en, can In&s;pect the Title and Value of Lands in all the remote Parts of the Province, better than the &s;everal Towns can act for them&s;elves? Or will the Sallaries of &s;uch Com|mittees be &s;o &s;mall, as to be le&s;s than if the &s;everal Towns have the Management for their own Advantage? Or can it con&s;i&s;t with the Wi&s;dom of a Religious People, even to force tho&s;e to be <HI>U&s;urers,</HI> who&s;e Judgment and Con&s;cience is ut|terly again&s;t it; and for failure of paying Debt and Intere&s;t, to &s;wallow up the E&s;tates of their poor Neighbours? Is not this what is abhorred by <HI>Jews, Turks</HI> and <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI>; (<HI>viz.</HI>) To eat up their poor Neighbours by <HI>U&s;ury</HI>?</P>
<P>Have the Laws of any Chri&s;tian Nation ever approved of it, or any more that barely tollerated it? And have not ma|ny

of the Celebrated Divines in <HI>England</HI> declar'd it utterly Unlawful? And mu&s;t this Country run Retrograde to all?</P>
<P>To Conclude; Take the Words of the Law-Book, Title (<HI>U&s;ury</HI>) which was Enacted when there was in the General Court, many Wi&s;e Religious Men, and &s;uch as were of the Fir&s;t Comers; where after they have expre&s;t, that none &s;hall be adjudged more than <HI>Eight Pounds</HI> in the Hundred for Forbearance for a Year, adds, P. 153. the&s;e Words; <HI>Neither &s;hall this be a Colour or Countenance to allow any U&s;ury among us, contrary to the Law of God.</HI></P>
