<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE abilities of LORD CHESTERFIELD to inculcate &s;uch precepts as &s;hould form the mind and fa&s;hion the manners of youth&punc; are too uni|ver&s;ally admired to need encomium. In the ADVICE of that noble EARL to his SON, there are to be found &s;uch judicious remarks on men, manners, and things, connected with &s;o intimate a knowledge of the world, that the &s;entiments, con&s;idered as maxims, form a very valuable &s;y&s;tem of education.</P>
<P>But as the ob&s;ervations of different writers on the &s;ame &s;ubject are mutually illu&s;trative of each other; to render the following work &s;till more acceptable, the MARCHIONESS DE LAMBERT's "Advice to her Son," a tract particularly recommended by Lord CHESTERFIELD to HIS SON, is annex|ed.</P>
<P>That nothing might be wanting to render the following work complete, the PRECEPTS of Lord BURLEIGH to his SON are added, as highly e&s;tima+ble on the &s;ubjects of manners and education.

acquire weight; but when a &s;eries of well-dige&s;ted Precepts, the re&s;ult of great knowledge and exten&s;ive experience, are delivered for the guidance of a Son in the momentous concerns of life and happine&s;s, the Preceptor claims our e&s;teem, and his opinions our reverence.</P>

<HEAD>LORD CHESTERFIELD's ADVICE TO HIS SON.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ABSENCE OF MIND.</HEAD>
<P>AN Ab&s;ent Man is generally either a very weak, or a very affected man; he is, how|ever, a very di&s;agreeable man in company. He is defective in all the common offices of civility; he does not enter into the general conver&s;ation, but breaks into it from time to time, with &s;ome &s;tarts of his own, as if he waked from a dream. He &s;eems wrapt up in thought, and po&s;&s;ibly does not think at all: he does not kno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his mo&s;t inti|mate acquaintance by &s;ight, or an&s;wers them as if he were at cro&s;s-purpo&s;es. He leaves his hat in one room, his cane in another, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would pro|bably leave his &s;hoes in a third if his buckles, though awry, did not &s;ave them. This is a &s;ure indication, either of a mind &s;o weak that it can|not bear above one object at a time; or &s;o affect|ed, that it would be &s;uppo&s;ed to be wholly en|gro&s;&s;ed by &s;ome very great and important objects. Sir I&s;aac Newton, Mr. Locke, and perhaps five

or &s;ix more &s;ince the Creation, may have had a right to ab&s;ence, from the inten&s;e thought their inve&s;tigations required; but &s;uch liberties cannot be claimed by, nor will be tolerated in, any other per&s;ons.</P>
<P>No man is, in any degree, fit for either bu&s;ine&s;s or conver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd his attention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t object, be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> what i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> When I &s;ee a man ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent in mind, I c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;e to be ab&s;ent in body; for it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;tay in the room, as I cannot &s;tand inattention and awkward|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I would rather be in company with a dead man than with an ab&s;ent one; for if the dead man affords me no plea&s;ure, at lea&s;t he &s;hews me no contempt; whereas the ab&s;ent man very plainly, though &s;ilently, tells me that he does not think me worth his attention. Be&s;ides, an ab&s;ent man can never make any ob&s;ervations upon the cha|racters, cu&s;toms, and manners of the company. He may be in the be&s;t companies all his life-time (if they will admit him), and never become the wi&s;er: we may as well conver&s;e with a deaf man, as an ab&s;ent one. It is indeed a practical blunder to addre&s;s our&s;elves to a man, who, we plainly perceive, neither hears, minds, nor under&s;tands us.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ATTENTION.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN is fit for neither bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure, who either cannot, or does not command and direct his attention to the pre&s;ent object, and, in &s;ome degree, bani&s;h, for that time, all other objects from his thoughts. If at a ball, a &s;up|per,
<PB N="3" REF="025064_0011_0FCE483C2C7A2778">
or a party of plea&s;ure, a man were to be &s;olving, in his own mind, a problem in Euclid, he would be a very bad companion, and make a poor figure in that company; or if, in &s;tudying a problem in his clo&s;et, he were to think of a minuet, I am apt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o believe that he would make a very poo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mathematician&punc;</P>
<P>There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ough for eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ything, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the cour&s;e of the day, if you do but one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce: but there is not time enough in the year, if you will do two things at a time.</P>
<P>This &s;teady and undi&s;&s;ipated attention to one ob|ject is a &s;ure mark of a &s;uperior genius; as hurry, bu&s;tle, and agitation, are the never-failing &s;ymptoms of a weak and frivolous mind.</P>
<P>Indeed, without attention nothing is to be done: want of attention, which is really want of thought, is either folly or madne&s;s. You &s;hould not only have attention to every thing, but a quickne&s;s of attention, &s;o as to ob&s;erve, at once, all the people in the room, their motions, their looks, and their words; and yet, without &s;taring at them, and &s;eeming to be an ob&s;erver. This quick and unob&s;erved ob&s;ervation is of infinite advantage in life, and is to be acquired with care; and, on the contrary, what is called ab&s;ence, which is a thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s and want of attention about what is doing, makes a man &s;o like either a fool or a madman, that, for my part, I &s;ee no real difference. A fool never has thought; a madman has lo&s;t it; and an ab&s;ent man is, for the time, without it.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the mo&s;t material knowledge of all, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mean the knowledge of the world, is never to be acquired without great attention: and I know many old people, who, though they have lived
<PB N="4" REF="025064_0012_0FCE4840AD3C5668">
long in the world, are but children &s;till as to the knowledge of it, from their levity and inattention. Certain forms, which all people comply with, and certain arts, which all people aim at, hide, in &s;ome degree, the truth, and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve a general exterior re&s;em|blance to almo&s;t every body. Attention and &s;agacity mu&s;t &s;ee through that veil, and di&s;cover the natural character.</P>
<P>Add to this, there are little att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntions which are infinitely engaging, and which &s;en&s;ibly affect that degree of pride and &s;elf-love which is in&s;eparable from human nature; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they are unque&s;tionable proofs of the regard and con&s;ideration which we have for the per&s;ons to whom we pay them. As for ex|ample: Suppo&s;e you invited any body to dine or &s;up with you, you ought to recollect if you had ob|&s;erved that they had any favourite di&s;h, and take care to provide it for them: and when it came, you &s;hould &s;ay,
<Q>You &s;eemed to me, at &s;uch and &s;uch a place, to give this di&s;h a preference, and there|fore I ordered it.</Q>
&mdash;This is the wine that I ob&s;erv|ed you liked, and therefore I procured &s;ome." Again: Mo&s;t people have their weakne&s;&s;es; they have their aver&s;ions or their likings to &s;uch or &s;uch things. If we were to laugh at a man for his aver&s;i|on to a cat or chee&s;e (which are common antipathies) or, by inattention or negligence, to let them come in his way where we could prevent it; he would, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, think him&s;elf in&s;ulted, and in the &s;econd, &s;lighted; and would remember both. But, on the other hand, our care to procure for him what he likes, and to remove from him what he di&s;likes, &s;hews him that he is at lea&s;t an object of our atten|tion, flatters his vanity, and perhaps makes him more you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> friend, than a more important &s;ervice
<PB N="5" REF="025064_0013_0FCE4842E34A0308">
have done. The more trifling the&s;e things are, the more they prove your attention for the per&s;on, and are con&s;equently the more engaging. Con|&s;ult your own brea&s;t, and recollect how the&s;e lit|tle attentions, when &s;hewn you by others, flatter that degree of &s;elf-love and vanity from which no man living is free. Reflect how they incline and attract you to that per&s;on, and how you are pro|pitiated afterwards to all which that per&s;on &s;ays or does. The &s;ame cau&s;es will have the &s;ame effects in your favour.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>AWKWARDNESS OF DIFFERENT KINDS.</HEAD>
<P>MANY very worthy and &s;en&s;ible people have certain odd tricks, ill habits, and awkward|ne&s;&s;es in their behaviour, which excite a di&s;gu&s;t to, and di&s;like of their per&s;ons, that cannot be removed or overcome by any other valuable endowment or merit which they may po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>Now awkwardne&s;s can proceed but from two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u|&s;es: either from not having kept good compa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, or from not having attended to it.</P>
<P>When an awkward fellow fir&s;t comes into a room, it is highly probale, that his &s;word gets between his legs, and throws him down, or makes him &s;tumble, at lea&s;t; when he has recovered th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> accident, he goes and places him&s;elf in the very place of the whole room where he &s;hould not; there he &s;oon lets his hat fall down, and in taking it up again, throws down his cane; in recover|ing his cane, his hat falls a &s;econd time; &s;o that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a quarter of an hour before he is in order
<PB N="6" REF="025064_0014_0FCE48446BDCD220">
again. If he drinks tea or coffee, he certainly &s;calds his mouth, and lets either the cup or the &s;acer fall, and &s;pills the tea or coffee in his breeches. At dinner, his awkwardne&s;s di&s;tin|gui&s;hes it&s;elf particularly, as he has more to do; there he holds his knife, fork, and &s;poon, dif|ferently from other people; eats with his knife to the great danger of his mouth, picks his teeth with his fork, and puts his &s;poon, which has been in his throat twenty times, into the di&s;hes again. If he is to carve, he can never hit the joint; but, in his vain efforts to cut through the bone, &s;catters the &s;auce in every body's face. He generally daubs him&s;elf with &s;oup and grea&s;e, though his napkin is commonly &s;tuck through a button-hole, and tickles his chin. When he drinks, he infallibly coughs in his gla&s;s, and be|&s;prinkles the company. Be&s;ides all this, he has &s;trange tricks and ge&s;tures; &s;uch as &s;nuffing up his no&s;e, making faces, putting his fingers in his no&s;e, or blowing it and looking afterwards in his handkerchief, &s;o as to make the company &s;ick. His hands are trouble&s;ome to him when he has not &s;omething in them, and he does not known where to put them; but they are in perpetual mo|tion between his bo&s;om and his breeches: he does not wear his cloaths, and, in &s;hort, does nothing like other people.

<P>There is a very material difference between mo|de&s;ty and an awkward ba&s;hfulne&s;s, which is as ridi|culous as true mode&s;ty is commendable&punc; it is as ab|&s;urd to be a &s;impleton as to be an impudent fellow; and we make our&s;elves contemptible, if we can|not come into a room and &s;peak to people without being out of countenance, or without embarra&s;&s;|ment.

<HEAD>COMPANY.</HEAD>
<P>TO keep good company, e&s;pecially at your fir&s;t &s;etting out is the way to receive good im|pre&s;&s;ions. Good company is not what re&s;pective &s;ets of company are plea&s;ed either to call or think them&s;elves. It con&s;i&s;ts chiefly (though not wholly) of people of con&s;iderable birth, rank, and cha|racter; for people of neither birth nor rank are frequently and very ju&s;tly admitted into it, if di&s;tingui&s;hed by any peculiar merit, or eminency in any liberal art or &s;cience. So motly a thing is good company, that many people, without birth, rank, or merit, intrude into it by their own forwardne&s;s, and others get into it by the protection of &s;ome con&s;iderable per&s;on. In this fa&s;hionable good company, the be&s;t manners and the pure&s;t language are mo&s;t unque&s;tionably to be learned: for they e&s;tabli&s;h and give the TON to both, which are called the language and man|ners of good company, neither of them being a&s;|certained by any legal tribunal.</P>
<P>A company of people of the fir&s;t quality can|not be called good company, in the common ac|ceptation of the phra&s;e, unle&s;s they are the fa&s;hi|onable and accredited company of the place; for people of the fir&s;t quality can be as &s;illy, as ill-bred, and as worthle&s;s, as people of the meane&s;t degree: and a company, con&s;i&s;ting wholly of people of very low condition, what|ever their merit or talents may be, can never be called good company; and therefore &s;hould not be much frequented, though by no means de&s;|pi&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="025064_0019_0FCE484DB469D8C0">A company wholly compo&s;ed of learned men, though greatly to be re&s;pected, is not meant by the words <HI>good company</HI>: they cannot have the ea&s;y and poli&s;hed manners of the world, as they do not live in it. If we can bear our parts well in &s;uch a company, it will be proper to be in it &s;ometimes, and we &s;hall be more e&s;teemed in other companies for having a place in that.</P>
<P>A company con&s;i&s;ting wholly of profe&s;&s;ed wits and poets, is very inviting to young men who are plea&s;ed with it, if they have wit them&s;elves; and if they have none, are fooli&s;hly proud of being one of it. But &s;uch companies &s;hould be frequented with moderation and judgment. A wit is a very unpopular denomination, as it car|ries terror along with it; and people are as much afraid of a wit in company as a woman is of a gun, which &s;he &s;uppo&s;es may go off of it&s;elf, and do her a mi&s;chief. Their acquaintance, however, is worth &s;eeking, and their company worth fre|quenting; but not exclu&s;ively of others, nor to &s;uch a degree as to be con&s;idered only as one of that parti|cular &s;et.</P>
<P>Above all things, endeavour to keep company with people above you; for there you ri&s;e, as much as you &s;ink with people below you. When I &s;ay company above you, I do not mean with regard to their birth, but with regard to their merit, and the light in which the world con&s;iders them.</P>
<P>There are two &s;orts of good company; one which is called the BEAU MONDE, and con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e people who have the lead in cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and in the gay part of life; the other con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e who are di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome peculiar merit, or
<PB N="12" REF="025064_0020_0FCE484EE411C7A8">
who excel in &s;ome particular or valuable art or &s;cience.</P>
<P>Be equally careful to avoid that low company which, in every &s;en&s;e of the word, is low indeed; low i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> rank, low in parts, low in manners, and low in merit. Vanity that &s;ource of many of our fol|lies, and of &s;ome of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r crimes, has &s;unk many a man into company in every light infinitely below him, for the &s;ake of being the fir&s;t man in it. There he dictates, is applauded, and admired; but he &s;oon di&s;graces him&s;elf, and di&s;qualifies him&s;elf for any bet|ter company.</P>
<P>Having thus pointed out what company you &s;hould avoid, and what company you &s;hould a&s;&s;ociate with, I &s;hall next lay down a few CAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN ADOP|TING THE MANNERS OF A COMPANY.</P>
<P>WHEN a young man, new in the world, fir&s;t gets into company, he determine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to conform to and imitate it. But he too often mi&s;takes the ob|ject of his imitation. He has frequently heard the ab&s;urd term of genteel and fa&s;hionable vices. He there ob&s;erves &s;ome people who &s;hine, and who in general are admired and e&s;teemed; and perceives that the&s;e people are rakes, drunkards, or game&s;ters; he therefore adopts their vices, mi&s;taking their defects for their perfections, and imagining that they owe their fa&s;hion and their l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tre to the&s;e genteel vices. But it is exactly the rever&s;e; for the&s;e people have acquired their reputation by their parts, their learning, their good-breeding, and other real accompli&s;hments: and are only blemi&s;hed and lowered in the opi|nions
<PB N="13" REF="025064_0021_0FCE48545ECE71B0">
of all rea&s;onable people by the&s;e general and fa&s;hionable vices. It is therefore plain that, in the&s;e mixed characters, the good part only makes people forgive, but not approve the bad.</P>
<P>If a man &s;hould, unfortunately, have any vices, he ought at lea&s;t to be content with his own, and not adopt other people's. The adoption of vice has ruined ten times more young men, than natural inclinations.</P>
<P>Let us imitate the real perfections of the good company into which we may get; copy their po|litene&s;s, their carriage, their addre&s;s, and the ea&s;y and well-bred turn of their conver&s;ation; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> we &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould remember, that, let them &s;hine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ght, their vices, if they have any, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> blemi&s;hes, which we &s;hould no more en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to imitate, than we would make arti|ficial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arts upon our faces, becau&s;e &s;ome very hand&s;ome man had the misfortune to have a na|tural one upon his.

<P>There are a thou&s;and &s;uch follies and extrava|gancies which vanity draws people into, and which always defeat their own purpo&s;e.

Real friend&s;hip is a &s;low grower; and never thrives, unle&s;s ingrafted upon a &s;tock of known and reciprocal merit.</P>
<P>There is another kind of nominal friend&s;hip among young people, which is warm for the time, but luckily of &s;hort duration.

<P>Good-breeding alone can prepo&s;&s;e&s;s people in our favour at fir&s;t &s;ight; more time being nece&s;|&s;ary to di&s;cover greater talents. Good-breeding, however, does not con&s;i&s;t in low bows and formal ceremony; but in an ea&s;y, civil, and re&s;pectful be|haviour.</P>
<P>Indeed, good-&s;en&s;e in many ca&s;es mu&s;t deter|mine good-breeding; for what would be civil at one time, and to one per&s;on, would be rude at another time, and to another per&s;on; there are, however, &s;ome general rules of good-breeding. As for example: To an&s;wer only Yes, or No, to any per&s;on, without adding, Sir, My Lord, or Madam (as it may happen), is always ex|tremely rude; and it is equally &s;o not to give proper attention and a civil an&s;wer when &s;poken to: &s;uch behaviour convinces the per&s;on who is &s;peaking to us, that we de&s;pi&s;e him, and do not think him worthy of our attention, or an an|&s;wer.</P>
<P>A well-bred per&s;on will take care to an&s;wer with complai&s;ance when he is &s;poken to; will place him&s;elf at the lower end of the table, un|le&s;s

bid to go higher; will fir&s;t drink to the lady of the hou&s;e, and then to the ma&s;ter; he will not eat awkwardly or dirtily, nor &s;it when other &s;tand; and he will do all this with an air of complai&s;ance, and not with a grave ill natured look, as if he did it all unwillingly.</P>
<P>There is nothing more difficult to attain, or &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to po&s;&s;e&s;s, as perfect good-breeding; which is equally incon&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tiff formality, an impertinent forwardne&s;s, and an awkward ba&s;hfulne&s;s.

<P>Virtue and learning, like gold, have their in|trin&s;ic value; but if they are not poli&s;hed, they certainly lo&s;e a great deal of their lu&s;tre; and even poli&s;hed bra&s;s will pa&s;s upon more people than rough gold.

It is much more &s;o with regard to women; who, of what|ever rank they are, are intitled, in con&s;ideration of their &s;ex, not only to an attentive, but an offi|cious good-breeding from men. Their little wants, likings, di&s;likes, preferences, antipathies, fancies, whims, and even impertinencies, mu&s;t be officiou&s;ly attended to, flattered, and, if po&s;|&s;ible, gue&s;&s;ed at and anticipated by a well-bred man.

He watches how they addre&s;s them&s;elves to their &s;uperiors, how they acco&s;t their equals and how they treat their inferiors; and lets none of tho&s;e little niceties e&s;cape him, which are to good-breading what the la&s;t delicate and ma&s;terly touches are to a good picture, and which the vulgar have no notion of, but by which good judges di&s;tingui&s;h the ma&s;ter. He attends even to their air, dre&s;s, and motions, and imitates them liberally, and not fervilely: he copies, but does not mimic. The&s;e per&s;onal graces are of very great con&s;equence. They anticipate the &s;entiments before merit can engage the under|&s;tanding; they captivate the heart, and give ri&s;e.

<HEAD>Art of plea&s;ing.</HEAD>
<P>THE de&s;ire of plea&s;ing is at lea&s;t half the art of doing it; the re&s;t depends only upon the man|ner, which attention, ob&s;ervation, and frequent|ing good company will teach. Tho&s;e who are lazy, carele&s;s, and indifferent whether they plea&s;e or not, we may depend upon it, will never plea&s;e. The art of plea&s;ing is a very nece&s;&s;ary one to po&s;|&s;e&s;s, but a very difficult one to acquire. To do as one would be done by, is the &s;ure&s;t method of plea&s;ing. Ob&s;erve carefully what plea&s;es us in others, and probably the &s;ame things in us will plea&s;e others. If we are plea&s;ed with the com|plai&s;ance and attention of others to our humours, our ta&s;tes, or our weakne&s;&s;es; the &s;ame complai|&s;ance and attention on our parts to theirs, will equally plea&s;e them. Let us be &s;erious, gay, or even trifling, as we find the pre&s;ent humour of the company: this is an attention due from every individual to the majority. The art of plea&s;ing cannot be reduced to a receipt; if it could, that receipt would be worth purcha&s;ing at any price. Good &s;en&s;e and good-nature are the principal in|gredients; and our own ob&s;ervation, and the good advice of others, mu&s;t give the right colour and ta&s;te to it.</P>

<P>If we examine our&s;elves &s;eriou&s;ly, why parti|cular people plea&s;e and engage us more than others of equal merit, we &s;hall always find, that it is becau&s;e the former have the Graces, and the latter not. I have known many a woman, with an exact &s;hape, and a &s;ymmetrical a&s;&s;emblage of beautiful features, plea&s;e nobody; while others, with very moderate &s;hapes and features, have charmed every body. It is certain that Venus will not charm &s;o much without her attendant Graces, as they will without her. Among men, how often has the mo&s;t &s;olid merit been neglect|ed, unwelcome, or even rejected for want of them! while &s;lim&s;y parts, little knowledge, and le&s;s me|rit, introduced by the Graces, have been received, cheri&s;hed, and admired!</P>

<P>The differ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce in dre&s;s between a man and a fop is, that the fop values him&s;elf upon his dre&s;s; and the man of &s;en&s;e laughs at it, at the &s;ame time that he knows he mu&s;t not neglect it: there are a thou|&s;and fooli&s;h cu&s;toms of this kind, which, as they are not criminal, mu&s;t be complied with, and even chearfully, by men of &s;en&s;e.

<HEAD>Pronuncia|tion in &s;peak|ing.</HEAD>
<P>To acquire a graceful utterance, read aloud to &s;ome friend every day, and beg of him to interrupt and correct you whenever you read too fa&s;t, do not ob&s;erve the proper &s;tops, lay a wrong empha&s;is, or utter your words unintelligi|bly. You may even read aloud to your&s;elf, and tune your utterance to your own ear. Take care to open your teeth when you read or &s;peak, and articulate every word di&s;tinctly; which la&s;t cannot be done but by &s;ounding the final letter. But above all, &s;tudy to vary your voice according to the &s;ub|ject, and avoid a monotony. Daily attention to the&s;e articles will, in a little time, render them ea&s;y and habitual to you.</P>
<P>The voice and manner of &s;peaking, too, are not to be neglected; &s;ome people almo&s;t &s;hut their mouths when they &s;peak, and mutter &s;o that they are not be under&s;tood; others &s;peak &s;o fa&s;t, and &s;putter, that they are not to be under&s;tood neither: &s;ome always &s;peak as loud as if they were talking to deaf people; and others &s;o low, that one cannot hear them. All the&s;e habits are awk|ward and di&s;agreeable, and are to be avoided by attention; they are the di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of the ordinary people, who have had no care taken of their education. You cannot imagine how nece&s;&s;ary it is to mind all the&s;e little things; for I have &s;een many people, with great talents, ill-received for the want of having the&s;e talents; and

<P>Though men are all of one compo&s;ition, the &s;everal ingredients are &s;o differently proportioned in each individual, that no two are exactly alike; and no one, at all times, like him&s;elf. The able&s;t man will, &s;ometimes, do weak things; the proude&s;t man, mean things; the hone&s;t man, ill things; and the wickede&s;t man, good things. Study individuals then, and if you take (as you ought to do) their outlines from their prevailing pa&s;&s;ion, &s;u&s;pend your la&s;t fini&s;hing &s;trokes till you have attended to and have di&s;covered the opera|tions of their inferior pa&s;&s;ions, appetites, and
<PB N="57" REF="025064_0065_0FCE48AEE9D60988">
humours. A man's general character may be that of the hone&s;t man in the world; do not di&s;pute it; you might be thought envious or ill-natured; but, at the &s;ame time, do not take this probity upon tru&s;t, to &s;uch a degree as to put your life, fortune, or reputation in his power. This hone&s;t man may happen to be your rival in power, in intere&s;t, or love; three pa&s;&s;ions that often put hone&s;ty to mo&s;t &s;evere trials, in which it is too often ca&s;t; but fir&s;t analy&s;e this hone&s;t man your|&s;elf, and then only you will be able to judge, how far you may, or may not, with &s;afety tru&s;t him.</P>
<P>If you would particularly gain the affection and friend&s;hip of particular people, whether men or women, endeavour to find out their predomi|nant excellency, if they have one, and their pre|vailing weakne&s;s, which every body has; and do ju&s;tice to the one, and &s;omething more than ju&s;|tice to the other. Men have various objects in which they may excel, or at lea&s;t would be thought to excel; and though they love to hear ju&s;tice done to them where they know that they excel, yet they are mo&s;t and be&s;t flattered upon tho&s;e points where they with to excel, and yet are doubt|ful whether they do or not. As for example: Cardinal Richelieu, who was undoubtedly the able&s;t &s;tate&s;man of his time, or perhaps of any other, had the idle vanity of being thought the be&s;t poet too; he envied the great Corneille his reputation, and ordered a critici&s;m to be written upon the <HI>Cid.</HI> Tho&s;e, therefore, who flattered &s;kilfully, &s;aid little to him of his abilities in &s;tate affairs, or at lea&s;t but <HI>en pa&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt,</HI> and as it might naturally occur. But the incen&s;e which they gave him, the &s;moke of which they knew would

turn his head in their favour, was as a <HI>bel e&s;prit</HI> and a poet. Why? Becau&s;e he was &s;ure of one excel|lency, and di&s;tru&s;tful as to the other.</P>
<P>You will ea&s;ily di&s;cover every man's prevailing vanity, by ob&s;erving his favourite topic of con|ver&s;ation; for every man talks mo&s;t of what he has mo&s;t a mind to be thought to excel in. Touch him but there, and you touch him to the quick.</P>
<P>Women have in general but one object, which is their beauty; upon which &s;carce any flattery is too gro&s;s for them to &s;wallow. Nature has hardly formed a woman ugly enough to be in|&s;en&s;ible to flattery upon her per&s;on; if her face is &s;o &s;hocking, that &s;he mu&s;t, in &s;ome degree, be con&s;cious of it, her figure and her air, &s;he tru&s;ts, makes ample amends for it. If her figure is deformed, her face, &s;he thinks, counterba|lances it. If they are both bad, &s;he comforts her&s;elf that &s;he has graces; a certain manner; a <HI>je ne &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ais quoi,</HI> &s;till more engaging than beauty. This truth is evident from the &s;tudied and ela|borate dre&s;s of the uglie&s;t women in the world. An undoubted, unconte&s;ted, con&s;cious beauty is, of all women, the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible of flattery upon that head; &s;he know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it is her due, and is therefore obliged to nobody for giving it her. She mu&s;t be flattered upon her under&s;tanding; which though &s;he may po&s;&s;ibly not doubt of her&s;elf, yet &s;he &s;u&s;pects that men may di&s;tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Do not mi&s;take me, and think that I mean to recommend to you abject and criminal flattery: no, flatter nobody's vices or crimes; on the con|trary, abhor and di&s;courage them. But there is no living in the world without a complai&s;ant in|dulgence for people's weakne&s;&s;es, and innocent

though ridiculous vanities. If a man has a mind to be thought wi&s;er, and a woman hand&s;omer than they really are, their error is a comfortable one to them&s;elves, and an innocent one with re|gard to other people; and I would rather make them my friends, by indulging them in it, than my enemies, by endeavouring (and that to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o purpo&s;e) to undeceive them.</P>

<P>Be upon your guard again&s;t tho&s;e who, upon very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">light acquaintance, obtrue their una&s;ked and unmerited friend&s;hip and confidence upon you; for they probably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ram you with them only for their own eating; but at the &s;ame time do not roughly reject them upon that general &s;uppo&s;i|tion.

<P>A certain degree of exterior &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s in looks and motions gives dignity, without excluding wit and decent chearfulne&s;s, which are always &s;erious them&s;elves. A con&s;tant &s;mirk upon the face, and a whiffling activity of the body, are &s;trong indications of futility. Whoever is in a hurry &s;hews that the thing he is about is too big for him.

<P>To conclude: A man who has patiently been kicked may as well pretend to courage, as a man bla&s;ted by vices and crimes may to dignity of any kind.

On the other hand, the cunning, crafty man thinks to gain all his ends by gentlene&s;s of manners only: <HI>he becomes all things in all men</HI>; he &s;eems to have no opinion of his own, and &s;er|vilely adopts the pre&s;ent opinion of the pre&s;ent per&s;on; he in&s;inuates him&s;elf only into the e&s;teem of fools, but is &s;oon detected, and &s;urely de&s;pi&s;ed by every body el&s;e. The wi&s;e man (who differs as much from the cunning as from the choleric man) alone joins &s;oftne&s;s of manners with firm|ne&s;s of mind.</P>
<P>The advantages ari&s;ing from an union of the&s;e qualities are equally &s;triking and obvious. For example&punc; If you are in authority, and have a

<P>If you are to a&s;k a favour, or even to &s;olicit your due, you mu&s;t do it with a <HI>grace,</HI> or you will give tho&s;e who have a mind to refu&s;e you, a pretence to do it, by re&s;enting the manner; but, on the other hand, you mu&s;t, by a &s;teady per&s;everance and decent tenaciou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hew firm|ne&s;s and re&s;olution. The right motives are &s;el|dom the true ones of men's actions, e&s;pecially of people in high &s;tations; who often give to impor|tunity and fear what they would refu&s;e to ju&s;tice or to merit. By gentlene&s;s and &s;oftne&s;s engage their hearts, if you can; at lea&s;t prevent the pre|tence of offence; but take care to &s;hew re&s;olution and firmne&s;s enough to extort from their love of ea&s;e, or their fear, what you might in vain hope for from their ju&s;tice or good-nature. People in high life are hardened to the wants and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of mankind, as &s;urgeons are to their bodily pains; they &s;ee and hear of them all day long, and even of &s;o many &s;imulated ones, that they do not know which are real and which are not. Other &s;enti|ments are therefore to be applied to, than tho&s;e of mere ju&s;tice and humanity: their favour mu&s;t be captivated by the Graces; their love of ea&s;e di&s;turbed by unwearied importunity, or their
<PB N="71" REF="025064_0079_0FCE48CB100F1198">
fears wrought upon by a decent intimation of implacable, cool, re&s;entment. This precept is the only way I know in the world, of being loved without being de&s;pi&s;ed, and feared without being hated. It con&s;titutes the dignity of cha|racter, which every wi&s;e man mu&s;t endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>To conclude: If you find that you have a ha&s;tine&s;s in your temper, which unguardedly breaks out into indi&s;creet &s;allies, or rough ex|pre&s;&s;ions, to either your &s;uperiors, your equals, or your inferiors, watch it narrowly, check it carefully, and call the Graces to your a&s;&s;i&s;tance. At the fir&s;t impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, be &s;ilent till you can be &s;oft. Labour even to get the command of your countenance &s;o well, that tho&s;e emotions may not be read in it: a mo&s;t un&s;peakable advan|tage in bu&s;ine&s;s!

A yielding, timid meekne&s;s is always abu&s;ed and in&s;ulted by the unju&s;t and unfeeling; but when &s;u&s;tained by firmne&s;s and re&s;olution, is always re&s;pected, com|monly &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>In your friend&s;hips, and connections, as well as in your enmities, this rule is particularly u&s;eful; let your firmne&s;s and vigour pre&s;erve and invite attchments to you; but, at the &s;ame time, let your manner hinder the enemies of your friends and dependents from becoming yours: let your enemies be di&s;armed by the gentlene&s;s of

<HEAD>MORAL CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Moral Character of a man &s;hould be not only pure, but, like Cae&s;ar's wife, un&s;u&s;pect|ed. The lea&s;t &s;peck or blemi&s;h upon it is fatal.
<PB N="73" REF="025064_0081_0FCE48CDAAEB55D0">
Nothing degrades and villifies more, for it excites and unites dete&s;tation and contempt. There are, however, wretches in the world proffigate enough to explode all notions of moral good and evil; to maintain that they are merely local, and de|pend entirely upon the cu&s;toms and fa&s;hions of different countries: nay, there are &s;till, if po&s;&s;ible, more unaccountable wretches; I mean tho&s;e who affect to preach and propagate &s;uch ab&s;urd and infamous notions without believing them them|&s;elves. Avoid as much as po&s;&s;ible the com|pany of &s;uch people, who reflect a degree of di&s;|credi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and infamy upon all who conver&s;e with them. But as you may &s;ometimes by accident fall into &s;uch company, take great care that no complai&s;ance, no good-humour, no warmth of fe&s;|tal mirth, ever make you &s;eem even to acquie&s;ce, much le&s;s approve or applaud, &s;uch infamous doctrines. On the other hand, do not debate, nor enter into &s;erious argument, upon a &s;ubject &s;o much below it&punc; but content your&s;elf with telling them that you know they are not &s;erious; that you have a much better opinion of them than they would have you have; and that you are very &s;ure they would not practi&s;e the doctrine they preach. But put your private mark upon them, and &s;hun them for ever afterwards.</P>
<P>There is nothing &s;o delicate as a man's moral character, and nothing which it is his intere&s;t &s;o much to pre&s;erve pure. Should he be &s;u&s;pected of inju&s;tice, malignity, perfidy, lying, &amp;c. all the parts and knowledge in the world will never procure him e&s;teem, friend&s;hip, or re&s;pect. I therefore recommend to you a mo&s;t &s;crupulous tenderne&s;s for your moral character, and the utmo&s;t care not to &s;ay or do the lea&s;t thing that

<HEAD>COMMON-PLACE OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>NEVER u&s;e, believe, or approve Common-place Ob&s;ervations. They are the common topics of witlings and coxcombs; tho&s;e who really have wit have the utmo&s;t contempt for them,
<PB N="75" REF="025064_0083_0FCE48D159143250">
and &s;corn even to laugh at the pert things that tho&s;e would-be wits &s;ay upon &s;uch &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Religion is one of their favourite topics; it is all prie&s;t-craft, and an invention contrived and carried on by prie&s;ts of all religions for their own power and profit: from this ab&s;urd and fal&s;e principle flow the common-place in&s;ipid jokes and in&s;ults upon the clergy. With the&s;e people every prie&s;t of every religion is either a public or a concealed unbeliever, drunkard, and whorema&s;ter; whereas I conceive that prie&s;ts are extremely like other men, and neither the better nor the wor&s;e for wearing a gown or a &s;urplice; but if they are different from other people, probably it is rather on the &s;ide of religion and morality, or at lea&s;t decency, from their education and manner of life.</P>
<P>Another common topic for fal&s;e wit and cold raillery is matrimony. Every man and his wife hate each other cordially, whatever they may pretend in public to the contrary. The hu&s;band certainly wi&s;hes his wife at the devil, and the wife certainly cuckolds her hu&s;band. Whereas I pre&s;ume, that men and their wives neither love nor hate each other the more, upon account of the form of matrimony which has been &s;aid over them. The cohabitation, indeed, which is the con&s;equence of matrimony, makes them either love or hate more, accordingly as they re&s;pec|tively de&s;erve it; but that would be exactly the &s;ame, between any man and woman who lived toge|ther without being married.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o a trite common-place ob&s;ervation, that courts are the &s;eats of fal&s;hood and di&s;&s;imu|lation. That like many I might &s;ay mo&s;t common-place ob&s;ervations is fal&s;e. Fal&s;hood
<PB N="76" REF="025064_0084_0FCE48D2B455A4E0">
and di&s;&s;imulation are certainly to be found at courts; but where are they not to be found? Cottages have them, as well as courts; only with wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e manners. A couple of neighbouring farmers in a village will contrive and practi&s;e as many tricks to over-reach each other at the next market, or to &s;upplant each other in the favour of the 'Squire, as any two courtiers can do to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">upplant each other in the favour of their Prince. Whatever poets may write, or fools believe, of rural inno|cence and truth, and of the perfidy of courts, this is undoubtedly true&mdash;That &s;hepherds and mini&s;ters are both men&punc; their nature and pa&s;&s;ions the &s;ame, the modes of them only different.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many other common-place reflec|tions upon nations, or profe&s;&s;ions, in general (which are at lea&s;t as often fal&s;e as true) are the poor refuge of people who have neither wit nor invention of their own, but endeavour to &s;hine in company by &s;econd hand finery. I always put the&s;e pert jackanapes's out of countenance, by looking extremely grave, when they expect that I &s;hould laugh at their plea|&s;antries; and by &s;aying, <HI>Well&punc; and &s;o</HI>? as if they had not done, and that the &s;ting were &s;till to come. This di&s;concerts them, as they have no re&s;ources in them|&s;elves, and have but one &s;et of jokes to live upon.

<P>ORATORY, or the art of &s;peaking well, is u&s;e|ful in every &s;ituation of life, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in mo&s;t. A man cannot di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf without it in parliament, in the pulpit, or at the bar; and even in comon conver&s;ation, he who has acquired an ea&s;y and habitual elo|quence, and who &s;peaks with propriety and ac|curacy, will have a great advantage over tho&s;e who &s;peak inelegantly and incorrectly. The bu|&s;ine&s;s of oratory is to per&s;uade; and to plea&s;e is the mo&s;t effectual &s;tep towards per&s;uading. It is very advantageous for a man who &s;peaks in public to plea&s;e his hearers &s;o much as to gain their attention; which he cannot po&s;&s;ibly do, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of oratory.</P>
<P>It is certain that by &s;tudy and application every man may make him&s;elf a tolerable good orator, eloquence depending upon ob&s;ervation and care. Every man may, if he plea&s;es, make choice of good in&s;tead of bad words and phra&s;es, may &s;peak with propriety in&s;tead of impropriety, and may be clear and per&s;picuous in his recitals, in|&s;tead of dark and unintelligible; he may have grace in&s;tead of awkwardne&s;s in his ge&s;tures and deportment: in &s;hort, it is in the power of every man, with pains and application, to be a very agreeable in&s;tead of a very di&s;agreeable &s;peaker; and it is well worth the labour to excel other men in that particular article in which they excel be&s;t.</P>
<P>Demo&s;thenes thought it &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak well, that though he naturally &s;tuttred,
<PB N="78" REF="025064_0086_0FCE48D754CA47E8">
and had weak lungs, he re&s;olved by application to overcome tho&s;e di&s;advantages. He cured his &s;tammering by putting &s;mall pebbles in his mouth, and gradually &s;trengthened his lungs by daily u&s;ing him&s;elf to &s;peak loudly and di&s;tinctly for a con&s;iderable time. In &s;tormy weather he often vi&s;ited the &s;ea-&s;hore, where he &s;poke as loud as he could, in order to prepare him&s;elf for the noi&s;e and murmurs of the popular a&s;&s;emblies of the Athenians, before whom he was to &s;peak. By this extraordinary care and attention&punc; and the con&s;tant &s;tudy of the be&s;t authors, he became the greate&s;t oratory that his own, or any other age or country have produced.</P>
<P>Whatever language a per&s;on u&s;es, he &s;hould &s;peak it in its greate&s;t purity, and according to the rules of grammer; nor is it &s;ufficient that we do not &s;peak a language ill, we mu&s;t endeavour to &s;peak it well; for which purpo&s;e we &s;hould read the be&s;t authors with attention, and ob&s;erve how people of fa&s;hion and education &s;peak. Common people, in general, &s;peak ill; they make u&s;e of inelegant and vulgar expre&s;&s;ions, which people of rank never do. In numbers they frequent|ly join the &s;ingular and plural together, and confound the ma&s;culine with the feminine gender, and &s;eldom make choice of the proper ten&s;e. To avoid all the&s;e faults we &s;hould read with attention, and ob&s;erve the turn and expre&s;&s;ions of the be&s;t authors; nor &s;hould we pa&s;s over a word we do not perfectly under&s;tand, with|out &s;earching or enquiring for the exact meaning of it.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that a man mu&s;t be born a poet, but it is in his own power to make him&s;elf an orator; for to be a poet requires a certain degree of &s;trength and vivacity of mind; but that attention, reading, and labour, are &s;ufficient to form an orator.</P>

<P>HOW little do we reflect on the u&s;e and value of time! It is in every body's mouth, but in few people's practice. Every fool who &s;latterns away his whole time in nothings, frequently utters &s;ome trite common-place &s;entence to prove at once the value and the fleetne&s;s of time. The &s;un|dials all over Europe have &s;ome ingenious in&s;crip|tion to that effect; &s;o that nobody &s;quanders away their time without frequently hearing and &s;eeing how nece&s;&s;ary it is to employ it well, and how irrecoverable it is if lo&s;t.

<P>Many people think that they are in plea&s;ures, provided they are neither in &s;tudy nor in bu&s;ine&s;s. Nothing like it; they are doing nothing, and might ju&s;t as well be a&s;leep.

<P>BE extremely on your guard again&s;t vanity, the common failing of inexperienced youth; but particularly again&s;t that kind of vanity which dubs a man a coxcomb; a character which, once ac|quired, is more indelible than that of the prie&s;t|hood. It is not to be imagined by how many different ways vanity defeats its own purpo&s;es. One man decides peremptorily upon every &s;ub|ject, betrays his ignorance upon many, and &s;hews a di&s;gu&s;ting pre&s;umption upon the re&s;t: another de&s;ires to appear &s;ucce&s;sful among the women: he hints at the encouragement he has received from tho&s;e of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed rank and beauty, and intimates a particular connection with &s;ome one: if it is true, it is ungenerous; if fal&s;e, it is infamous: but in either ca&s;e he de&s;troys the re|putation he wants to get. Some flatter their va|nity by little ext<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aneous objects, which have not the lea&s;t relation to them&s;elves; &s;uch as being de&s;cended from, related to, or acquainted with, people of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit, and eminent cha|racters. They talk perpetually of their grand|father &s;uch-a-one, their uncle &s;uch a-one, and their intimate friend Mr. &s;uch-a-one, whom, po&s;|&s;ibly, they are hardly acquainted with. But ad|mitting it all to be as they would have it, what

then? Have they the more merit for tho&s;e acci|dents? Certainly not. On the contrary, their taking up adventitious, proves their want of in|trin&s;ic merit; a rich man never borrows. Take this rule for granted, as a never-failing one, that you mu&s;t never &s;eem to affect the character in which you have a mind to &s;hine. Mode&s;ty i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the only &s;ure bait, when you angle for prai&s;e. The affectation of courage will make even a brave man pa&s;s only for a bully; as the affectation of wit will make a man of parts pa&s;s for a coxcomb. By this mode&s;ty I do not mean timidity, and awkward ba&s;hfulne&s;s. On the contrary, be in|wardly firm and &s;teady, know your own value, whatever it may be, and act upon that principle; but take great care to let nobody di&s;cover that you do know your own value. Whatever real merit you have, other people will di&s;cover; and people always magnify their own di&s;coveries, as they le&s;&s;en tho&s;e of others.</P>

<HEAD>VIRTUE.</HEAD>
<P>VIRTUE is a &s;ubject which de&s;erves your and every man's attention. It con&s;i&s;ts in doing good, and in &s;peaking truth; the effects of it, therefore, are advantageous to all mankind, and to one's &s;elf in particular. Virtue makes us pity and relieve the misfortunes of mankind; it makes us promote ju&s;tice and good order in &s;ociety; and, in general, contributes to whatever tends to the real good of mankind. To our&s;elves it gives an inward comfort and &s;atisfaction, which no|thing el&s;e can do, and which nothing can rob us of. All other advantages depend upon others,
<PB N="94" REF="025064_0102_0FCE368D3244F138">
as much as upon our&s;elves. Riches, power, and greatne&s;s may be taken away from us by the vio|lence and inju&s;tice of others, or by inevitable ac|cidents; but virtue depends only upon our&s;elves, and nobody can take it away from us. Sickne&s;s may deprive us of all the plea&s;ures of the body; but it cannot deprive us of our virtue, nor of the &s;atisfaction which we feel from it. A virtuous man, under all the misfortunes of life, &s;till finds an inward comfort and &s;atisfaction, which makes him happier than any wicked man can be with all the other advantages of life. If a man has ac|quired great power and riches by fal&s;ehood, in|ju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, he cannot enjoy them: becau&s;e his con&s;cience will torment him, and con|&s;tantly reproa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h him with the means by which he got them. The &s;tings of his con&s;cience will not even let him &s;leep quietly; but he will dream of his crimes; and in the day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">time, when alone, and when he has time to think, he will be unea&s;y and melancholy. He is afraid of every thing; for, as he knows mankind mu&s;t hate him, he has rea&s;on to think they will hurt him if they can. Whereas if a virtuous man be ever &s;o poor and unfortunate in the world, &s;till his virtue is its own reward, and will comfort him under all af|flictions. The quiet and &s;atisfaction of his con&s;cience make him chearful by day, and &s;leep &s;ound of nights: he can be alone with plea&s;ure, and is not afraid of his own thoughts. Virtue forces her way, and &s;hines through the ob&s;curity, of a retired life; and, &s;ooner or letter, it always is rewarded.</P>
<P>To conclude:&mdash;Lord Shafte&s;bury &s;ays, that he would be virtuous for his own &s;ake, though nobody were to know it&punc; as he would he clean for his own &s;ake, though nobody were to &s;ee him.</P>

<HEAD>USEFUL MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS ON MEN AND MANNERS, Selected from Lord CHE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">TERFIELD's LETTERS.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN who does not &s;olidly e&s;tabli&s;h, and re|ally de&s;erve, a character of truth, probity, good manners, and good morals, at his fir&s;t &s;etting out in the world, may impo&s;e, and &s;hine like a me|teor for a &s;hort time, but will very &s;oon vani&s;h, and be extingui&s;hed with contempt. People ea&s;ily par|don, in young men, the common irregularities of the &s;en&s;es; but they do not forgive the lea&s;t vice of the heart.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t favours may be done &s;o awkward|ly and bunglingly as to offend; and di&s;agreea|ble things may be done &s;o agreeably as almo&s;t to oblige.</P>
<P>There are very few Captains of Foot who are not much better company than ever De&s;cartes or Sir I&s;aac Newton were. I honour and re&s;pect &s;uch &s;uperior genui&s;es; but I de&s;ire to conver&s;e with people of this world, who bring into com|pany their &s;hare, at lea&s;t, of chearfulne&s;s, good-breeding, and knowledge of mankind. In com|mon life, one much oftener wants &s;mall money, and &s;ilver, than gold. Give me a man who has ready ca&s;h about him for pre&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t expences; &s;ix-pences, &s;hillings, half-crowns, and crowns, which circulate ea&s;ily; but a man who has only an in|got

of gold about him, is much above common pur|po&s;es, and his riches are not handy nor convenient. Have as much gold as you plea&s;e in one pocket, but take care always to keep change in the other; for you will much oftener have occa&s;ion for a &s;hilling than for a guinea.</P>
<P>Advice is &s;eldom welcome, and tho&s;e who want it the mo&s;t always like it the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Envey is one of the meane&s;t and mo&s;t tormenting of all pa&s;&s;ions, as there is hardly a per&s;on exi&s;ting that has not given unea&s;ine&s;s to an envious brea&s;t; for the envious man cannot be happy while he beholds others &s;o.</P>
<P>A great action will always meet with the approba|tion of mankind, and the inward plea&s;ure which it produces is not to be expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Humanity is the particular characteri&s;tic of great minds; little vicious minds abound with anger and revenge, and are incapable of feeling the exalted plea|&s;ure of forgiving their enemies.</P>
<P>The ignorant and the weak only are idle; tho&s;e who have acquired a good &s;tock of knowledge al|was de&s;ire to increa&s;e it. Knowledge is like power in this re&s;pect, that tho&s;e who have the mo&s;t are mo&s;t de&s;irous of having more. Idlene&s;s is only the refuge of weak minds, and the holiday of fools.</P>
<P>Every man has a natural right to his liberty; and whoever endeavours to ravi&s;h it from him, de&s;erves death more than the robber who attacks us for our money on the highway.</P>
<P>Mode&s;ty is a commendable quality, and gene|rally accompanies true merit; it engages and captivates the minds of people; for nothing is
<PB N="97" REF="025064_0105_0FCE48FB02304D80">
more &s;hocking and di&s;gu&s;tful, than pre&s;umption and impudence. A man is de&s;pi&s;ed who is always commending him&s;elf, and who is the hero of his own &s;tory.</P>
<P>Not to perform our promi&s;e is a folly, a di&s;ho|nour, and a crime. It is a folly, becau&s;e no one will rely on us afterwards; and it is a di&s;honour and a crime, becau&s;e truth is the fir&s;t duty of re|ligion and morality: and whoever is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of truth, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any one good quality, and mu&s;t be held in dete&s;tation by all good men.</P>
<P>Wit may create many admirers, but makes few friends. It &s;hines and dazzles like the noon-day &s;un, but, like that too, is very apt to &s;corch, and therefore is always feared. The milder morning and evening light and heat of that planet &s;ooth and calm our minds. Never &s;eek for wit: if it pre|&s;ents it&s;elf, well and good; but even in that ca&s;e, let your judgment interpo&s;e; and take care that it be not at the expence of any body. Pope &s;ays very truly.
<Q><L>"There are whom heaven has ble&s;t with &s;tore of wit,</L>

And in another place, I doubt with too much truth,
<Q><L>"For wit and judgment ever are at &s;trife,</L>
<L>"Though meant each other's aid, like man and wife."</L></Q></P>
<P>A proper &s;ecrecy is the only my&s;tery of able men; my&s;tery is the only &s;ecrecy of weak and cun|ning ones.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="025064_0106_0FCE48FC38C28098">To tell any friend, wife, or mi&s;tre&s;s, any &s;ecret with which they have nothing to do, is di&s;covering to them &s;uch an unretentive weakne&s;s, as mu&s;t con|vince them that you will tell it to twenty others, and con&s;equently that they may reveal it without the ri&s;k of being di&s;covered. But a &s;ecret properly commu|nicated only to tho&s;e who are to be concerned in the que&s;tion will probably be kept by them, though they &s;hould be a good many. Little &s;ecrets are commonly told again, but great ones generally kept.</P>
<P>A man who tells nothing, or who tells all, will equally have nothing told him.</P>
<P>If a fool knows a &s;ecret, he tells it becau&s;e he is a fool; if a knave knows one, he tells it whereever it is his intere&s;t to tell it. But women and young men are very apt to tell what &s;ecrets they know, from the vanity of having been tru&s;ted. Tru&s;t none of the&s;e, wherever you can help it.</P>
<P>In your friend&s;hips, and in your enmities, let your confidence and your ho&s;tilities have certain bounds: make not the former dangerous, nor the latter irreconcileable. There are &s;trange vici&s;&s;itudes in bu&s;ine&s;s!</P>
<P>Smooth your way to the head through the heart. The way of rea&s;on is a good one; but it is commonly &s;omething longer, and perhaps not &s;o &s;ure.</P>
<P>Spirit is now a very fa&s;hionable word: to act with &s;pirit, to &s;peak with &s;pirit, means only to act ra&s;hly, and to talk indi&s;cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tly.

<P>It is always right to detect a fraud, and to perceive a folly; but it is often very wrong to expo&s;e either. A man of bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould always have his eyes open, but mu&s;t often &s;eem to have them &s;hut.</P>
<P>In courts, <HI>(and every where el&s;e)</HI> ba&s;hfulne&s;s and timidity are as prejudicial on one hand, as impudence and ra&s;hne&s;s are on the other. A &s;teady a&s;&s;urance and a cool intrepidity, with an exterior mode&s;ty, are the true and nece&s;&s;ary me|dium.</P>

It is a common, but a mo&s;t mi&s;taken rule at Court, to a&s;k for every thing in order to get &s;omething: you do get &s;omething by it, it is true; but that &s;omething is, refu&s;als and ri|dicule.&mdash;This maxim, like the former, is of general application.</P>
<P>A chearful, ea&s;y countenance and behaviour are very u&s;eful: they make fools think you a good-natured man; and they make de&s;igning men think you an unde&s;igning one.</P>

<P><PB N="101" REF="025064_0109_0FCE4901D82D06A0">The Due de Sully ob&s;erves very ju&s;tly, in his Memoirs, that nothing contributed more to his ri&s;e, than that prudent oeconomy which he had ob&s;erved from his youth; and by which he had always a &s;um of money before-hand, in ca&s;e of emer|gencies.</P>
<P>It is very difficult to fix the particular point of oeconomy; the be&s;t error of the two, is on the par|&s;imonious &s;ide. That may be corrected, the other cannot.</P>
<P>The reputation of genero&s;ity is to be purcha&s;ed pretty cheap; it does not depend &s;o much upon a man's general expence, as it does upon his giving hand&s;omely where it is proper to give at all.

<P>There are but two &s;ea&s;ons of life in which truth di&s;tingui&s;hes it&s;elf for our advantage: in youth, for our in&s;truction; and in our advanced years, to com|fort us.

<P>At your entering the world, you mu&s;t certainly propo&s;e to your&s;elf &s;ome end or other: you have too much &s;en&s;e to care to live without any de&s;ign at all; nor can you a&s;pire to any thing more becoming and worthy of you than glory. 'Tis a noble view for you to entertain; but it is fit for you to know what is meant by the term, and what notion you frame of it.</P>
<P>'Tis of various kinds, and each profe&s;&s;ion has a glory that is peculiar to it. In your's, my &s;on, it means the glory that attends valour. This is the glory of heroes; it makes a brighter figure than any other; it always carries with it the true marks of honour, and the recompences it de&s;erves; Fame &s;eems to have no tongue but to &s;ound their prai&s;e; and when you arrive at a certain degree of reputation, every thing you do is con&s;iderable.

They have put you in a capacity of attaining to any thing; 'tis not enough to equal them, you mu&s;t go beyond them, and arrive to the goal, I mean the honours which they were at the point of enjoying, when they were carried off by an untime|ly death.</P>
<P>Great fortunes are &s;o &s;eldom innocent, that I ea&s;ily forgive your ance&s;tors for not leaving you any. I have done all I could to bring out af|fairs into &s;ome order; a point in which women can di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves no way but by oeco|nomy. I &s;hall do my utmo&s;t to di&s;charge every duty incumbent upon me in my circum&s;tances: I &s;hall leave you as much as is fitting for you, if you are &s;o unhappy as to have no merit; and enough in all rea&s;on, if you have the virtues I wi&s;h you.</P>
<P>As I de&s;ire nothing upon earth &s;o much as to &s;ee you a perfectly hone&s;t man, let us &s;ee what &s;ort of conduct is nece&s;&s;ary to give one a title to that character, that we may know what we ought to do to de&s;erve it. I improve my&s;elf by the&s;e reflec|tions; and may perhaps be one day happy enough to change my precepts into examples.</P>
<P>She that exhorts another ought to lead the way her&s;elf. A Per&s;ian amba&s;&s;ador a&s;ked the wife of Leonidas,
<Q>Why they paid &s;uch honours to the women at Lacedaemon?</Q>
''Tis (replied &s;he) be|cau&s;e 'they have entirely the forming of the men. A Greek lady &s;howed her jewels to Phocion's mo|ther, and a&s;ked to &s;ee her's: The noble Athenian pointed to her children, and &s;aid to her, 'The&s;e

are my finery and jewels.' I hope, my &s;on, to find in time a like &s;ubject of glory in you. But let us return to the obligations which men are obliged to di&s;charge.</P>
<P>There is a certain order in the&s;e obligations. A man &s;hould know how to live with his &s;upe|rors, his equals&punc; and his inferiors, as well as with him&s;elf. With his &s;uperiors he &s;hould know how to plea&s;e without &s;inking into mean|ne&s;s, &s;hould &s;hew an e&s;teem and friend&s;hip to his equals, &s;hould conde&s;cend to his inferiors &s;o as not to let them feel the weight of his &s;uperiority, and &s;hould keep up a dignity with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>All the&s;e obligations are &s;till inferior to the vene|ration you owe to the Supreme Being. Religion is a corre&s;pondence &s;ettled between God and man, by the favours of God to men, and the wor&s;hip that men pay to God. Souls of a &s;uperior genius have noble &s;entiments for the Deity, and pay him a wor&s;hip pe|culiar to them&s;elves, very different from that of the vulgar: it all comes from their heart, and is directed immediately to God. Moral virtues are very pre|carious without the chri&s;tian to &s;upport them. I do not recommend to you a piety blended with weakne&s;s and &s;uper&s;tition; I only in&s;i&s;t, that the love of order &s;hould make you &s;ubmit your under&s;tanding and &s;en|timents to God, and &s;hould &s;hew it&s;elf in every part of your conduct; it will in&s;pire ju&s;tice into you, and ju&s;tice is the ba&s;is of all other virtues.</P>
<P>The generality of young men think to di&s;tin|gui&s;h them&s;elves now-a-days by a&s;&s;uming a li|bertine air, which degrades them among men of &s;en&s;e: Such an air, in&s;tead of arguing a &s;uperio|rity
<PB N="111" REF="025064_0117_0FCE49118DE0CF88">
of under&s;tanding, &s;hews only the depravity of the heart. People never attack religion, but when they have an intere&s;t to attack it: Nothing makes a man happier than to have his under|&s;tanding convinced, and his heart affected with it; 'tis of excelent u&s;e in every &s;ea&s;on and cir|cum&s;tance of life. Such as are not happy enough to believe as they ought, do yet find it rea&s;onable to &s;ubmit to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion: They know that what is mi&s;called prejudice has a great vogue in the world, and ought to be treated with re&s;pect.</P>
<P>A libertine way of thinking, and licentiou&s;ne&s;s of manners, ought to be bani&s;hed under the pre|&s;ent reign.</P>
<P>The behaviour of the Sovereign is a &s;ort of law to regulate that of others; it enjoins whatever he practi&s;es, and forbids what he declines doing. The failings of princes are multiplied, and their vir|tues are renewed by imitation. Though cour|tiers &s;hould be debauched in their &s;entiments, there is &s;till a politene&s;s reigning at court, which &s;erves to throw a veil over vice. We have the good fortune to be born in an age when purity of morals and a re&s;pect for religion are nece&s;&s;ary to plea&s;e the Prince.</P>
<P>I might, my &s;on, in the order of your du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es, in&s;i&s;t on what you own to me, but I would derive it entirely from your heart. Con&s;ider the con|dition in which your father left me: I had &s;acri|ficed all that belonged to me to rai&s;e his fortune, and I lo&s;t my all at his death. I &s;aw my&s;elf left alone, de&s;titute of any &s;upport. I had no friends but his; and I found by experience, that few per&s;ons are capable of being friends to the dead. I met with enemies in my own family: I had a

law-&s;uit upon my hands again&s;t potent adver&s;a|ries, and my whole fortune depended on the event. I gained it at la&s;t without any power of my own, and without any cringing to others. In a word, I made the be&s;t I could of my ill circum&s;tances; and as &s;oon as my own fortune was mended, I &s;et my&s;elf to make your's. Give me the &s;ame &s;hare in your friend&s;hip, that I &s;hall give you in my little fortune.</P>
<P>I will have no affected re&s;pect: I would have all your regards to me come not from con&s;traint, but purely from your heart. Let them proceed entirely from your inclinations, without being influenced by any motive of intere&s;t. In &s;hort, take care of your own glory, and I'll take care of every thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>You know how to conduct your&s;elf with your &s;uperiors: but there are &s;till &s;ome in&s;tructions to be given with regard to the duty you owe your Prince. You are of a family that has &s;acrificed their all for him. As for the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;ons on whom you depend, the fir&s;t merit is to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>In &s;ubaltern employments you have no way to &s;upport your&s;elf but by being agree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble: Ma&s;ters are ju&s;t like mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; whatever &s;ervices you have done them, they cea&s;e to love you as &s;oon as you cea&s;e to plea&s;e them.</P>
<P>There are various &s;orts of dignity, and they re+quire as various kinds of re&s;pect.</P>
<P>There are real and per&s;onal dignities, and there are dignities of in&s;titution: There is always a re|&s;pect due to per&s;ons in elevated &s;tations, but it is merely an outward re&s;pect: Our real re&s;pect and e&s;teem is due only to merit. When fortune and virtue have concurred to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;e a man to a high po&s;t, there is a double empire in the ca&s;e, which
<PB N="113" REF="025064_0119_0FCE491976E04B48">
commands a double &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; but let not the glittering of grandeu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> dazzle and impo&s;e upon you.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome mean &s;ouls that are always crouch|ing and grovelling before grandeur. One ought to &s;eparate the man from the dignity, and &s;ee what he is when he is &s;tripped of it. There is another great|ne&s;s very different from that which power and autho|rity give. 'Tis neither birth nor riches that di&s;tin|gui&s;h men; the only real and true &s;uperiority among them is merit.</P>
<P>The character of an hone&s;t man is a nobler ti|tle than any that fortune can be&s;tow. In &s;ubal|tern po&s;ts one is nece&s;&s;arily dependent: one mu&s;t make one's court to the mini&s;ters, but it mu&s;t be made with dignity. I &s;hall never give you any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">inging lectures; 'tis your &s;ervices that &s;hould &s;peak for you, and not any unbecoming &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Men of merit, when they make their court to Mini&s;ters, do them an honour, but &s;coun|drels di&s;grace them. Nothing is more agreeable than to be a friend of per&s;ons of dignity; but what lays the foundation of this friend&s;hip, is a de&s;ire to plea&s;e them.</P>
<P>Let your acquaintance be with per&s;ons that are above you; you will by that means get a habit of re&s;pect and politene&s;s. People are too carele&s;s when they conver&s;e with their equals; they grow dull for want of exerting their parts.</P>
<P>I do not know whether one may hope to find friends at court. As for per&s;ons of eminent dig|nity, their po&s;t exempts them from a great many duties, and covers abundance of their failings. 'Tis good to examine into men to know them
<PB N="114" REF="025064_0120_0FCE491AE2337E40">
thoroughly, and &s;ee them with their every day's merit about them. The favourites of fortune im|po&s;e upon you, when you look upon them at a di&s;|tance; the di&s;tance puts them in a point of view that is favourable to them: Fame always enhances their merit, and flattery deifies them. Examine them near, and you'll find them to be but men. What a number of ordinary creatures do we find at court! To rectify one's notions of greatne&s;s, one mu&s;t view it near; you'll cea&s;e immediately either to de&s;ire or fear it.</P>
<P>Let not the failings of great men corrupt you, but rather teach you to correct your own. Let the ill u&s;e which they make of their e&s;tates teach you to de&s;pi&s;e riches, and keep your&s;elf within bounds. Virtue &s;eldom has the direction of their expences.</P>
<P>Among the infinite number of ta&s;tes invented by luxury and &s;en&s;uality, why has there not been one formed for relieving the mi&s;erable? Does not humanity it&s;elf make you feel the nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;&s;i&s;ting your fellow-creatures? Good-natured and generous tempers are more &s;en&s;ible of the ob|ligation that lies upon them to do good, than they are of all the other nece&s;&s;ities of life. Marcus Aurelius thanked the Gods for his having always done good to his friends, without making them wait for it. 'Tis the great felicity of grandeur when others find their fortune in our's:
<Q>I can't (&s;aid that Prince) have any reli&s;h of a happine&s;s that nobody &s;hares in but my&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>The mo&s;t exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure in nature is to make the plea&s;ure of others; but for this end one mu&s;t not be too fond of the goods of fortune. Riches never were the parent of virtue, but virtue has often been the cau&s;e of riches. What u&s;e,
<PB N="115" REF="025064_0121_0FCE491C6024B2E0">
too, do the generality of great men make of the glory of their &s;tation? They put it all in exterior marks, and in an air of pride. Their dignity &s;its heavy on them and depre&s;&s;es others; whereas true greatne&s;s is humane; it is always ea&s;y of acce&s;s, and conde&s;cends even to &s;toop to you: &s;uch as really enjoy it, are at their ea&s;e, and make others &s;o too as well as them&s;elves. Their advancement does not co&s;t their any virtue, and the noblene&s;s of their &s;en|timents had formed, and in a manner habituated them to it beforehand. Their elevated &s;tation &s;eems natur|al to them, and nobody is a &s;uffer by it.</P>
<P>Titles and dignities are not the bonds that unite us to men, or gain them to us: Without merit and beneficence to recommend our grandeur to them, we have but a precarious tenure of their friend&s;hip; and they will only &s;eek to indemni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y them&s;elves at our expence, for the homage which they have been forced to pay to the po&s;t, rather than to the man that enjoys it, whom they will not fail to arraign freely, and condemn in his ab&s;ence. If envy be the motive that makes us love to le&s;&s;en the good qualities of men in great po&s;ts, 'tis a pa&s;&s;ion we ought to oppo&s;e, and ren|der them the ju&s;tice that they de&s;erve. We fancy frequently that we have no grudge but again&s;t the men, when indeed our malignity is owing to their places: Per&s;ons in great po&s;ts never yet en|joyed them with the good liking of the world, which only begins to do them ju&s;tice when they are out of place. Envy in &s;uite of it&s;elf pays a homage to greatne&s;s, at the &s;ame time that it &s;eems to de&s;pi&s;e it; for to envy places is to honour them. Let us not out of di&s;content condemn agreeable &s;tations, which have no fault but that
<PB N="116" REF="025064_0122_0FCE4921680AEA60">
we are not in them our&s;elves.&mdash;'Tis time now to pa&s;s to the duties of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Men have found it nece&s;&s;ary as well as agree|able to unite for the common good: They have made laws to re&s;train <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he wicked; they have agreed among&s;t them&s;elves as to the duties of &s;ociety, and have annexed an honourable cha|racter to the practice of tho&s;e duties. He is the hone&s;t man that ob&s;erves them with the mo&s;t exactne&s;s, and the in&s;tances of them multiply in proportion to the degree and nicety of a per&s;on's honour.</P>
<P>Virtues are linked together, and have a &s;ort of alliance with one another: What con&s;titutes a hero is the union of all the virtues. After pre|&s;cribing the duties nece&s;&s;ary for their common &s;ecurity, men &s;et them&s;elves to make their con|ver&s;ation agreeable, and &s;ettled certain rules of politene&s;s and living to be ob&s;erved by per&s;ons of birth and quality.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome failings, again&s;t which no pre|cepts are to be given: There are certain vices that are unknown to men of honour. Probity, fidelity in keeping one's word, and a love of truth, are &s;ubjects that I think I need not in&s;i&s;t on, and recommend to you: You know that a man of honour knows not what it is to tell a lie. What eulogiums does not the world give, and give de&s;ervedly, to lovers of truth: The man, &s;ay they, that does good and &s;peaks truth, re&s;embles the Deity, who&s;e e&s;&s;ential properties are goodne&s;s and truth. We are not indeed ob|liged always to &s;peak what we think, but we mu&s;t always think what we &s;peak. The true u&s;e of &s;peech is to promote truth. When a man has acquired a reputation for veracity, his word
<PB N="117" REF="025064_0123_0FCE49226447F2D8">
is taken implicitly; it has all the authority of an oath, and the world receives what he &s;ays with a &s;ort of religious re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Fal&s;hood in actions is full as incon&s;i&s;tent with a love of truth as fal&s;hood in words. Men of honour are never fal&s;e; what indeed have they to di&s;gui&s;e? Nor are they fond of &s;hewing them&s;elves, becau&s;e, &s;ooner or later, true merit will make its way.</P>
<P>Remember that the world will &s;ooner pardon you your failings, than the affectation of pretending to virtues which you have not in reality. Fal&s;e|hood affects to put on the air of truth, but a fal&s;e man's profe&s;&s;ions go no further than his looks and di&s;cour&s;es; whereas a man of veracity's are made good by his actions. It has been &s;aid a long time ago, that hypocri&s;y is an homage which vice pays to virtue: But the principal virtues are not of them&s;elves &s;ufficient to qualify a man to plea&s;e; he mu&s;t have likewi&s;e agreeable and engaging qualities.</P>
<P>When one aims at gaining a great reputation, one is always in a &s;tate of dependence on the opinion of others. It is very difficult for a man to ri&s;e to ho|nours by his &s;ervices, unle&s;s he has friends to &s;et them forth, and a manner of behaviour proper to recom|mend them.</P>
<P>I have told you already, that in &s;ubaltern po&s;ts a man can't &s;upport him&s;elf but by a knack of plea&s;ing; as &s;oon as ever he is neglected, he be|comes from that moment incon&s;iderable: There is nothing &s;o di&s;agreeable as to &s;hew a too great fondne&s;s for one's &s;elf, and expo&s;e one's vanity, &s;o as to make people &s;ee that we like our&s;elves above all the world, and that every thing centers in us.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="025064_0124_0FCE4923E37D3098">A man with a great deal of wit may make him|&s;elf very di&s;agreeable, when he only employs it to find out the failings of others, and expo&s;e them publicly. As for this &s;ort of men who only &s;hew their wit at other people's expence, they ought to con&s;ider that no body's life is &s;o perfectly without a blemi&s;h, as to give him a right to cen&s;ure another man's.</P>
<P>Rallery makes a part of the amu&s;ements of conver&s;ation, but is a very nice matter to manage. Per&s;ons that want to traduce, and love to rally, have a &s;ecret malignity in their heart. The mo&s;t agreeable rallery in nature gives offence, if it advances a &s;tep too far; &s;o ea&s;y is the tran&s;ition from the one to the other. A fal&s;e friend often abu&s;es the liberty of banter, and reflects upon you: In all ca&s;es of this nature, the per&s;on that you attack has the &s;ole right of judging whether you are in je&s;t or no; the moment that he takes offence, it cea&s;es to be rallery; 'tis a downright affront.</P>
<P>Rallery &s;hould never be u&s;ed but with regard to failings of &s;o little con&s;equence, that the per|&s;on concerned may be merry on the &s;ubject him|&s;elf. Nice rallery is a decent mixture of prai&s;e and reproach; it touches &s;lightly upon little fail|ings, only to dwell the more upon great qualities. Mon&s;ieur de la Rochefoucault &s;ays, that
<Q>the man who di&s;honours another, does le&s;s mi&s;chief than he that ridicules him:</Q>
I &s;hould be of his opinion for this rea&s;on, that it is not in any body's power to di&s;honour another; 'tis not the di&s;cour&s;e or reflections of others; 'tis only our own conduct that can di&s;honour us. The cau&s;es of di&s;honour are known and certain, but ridicule is entirely arbitrary: It depends on the manner
<PB N="119" REF="025064_0125_0FCE4925B83D6660">
how objects appear to us, and on our manner of thinking and taking them. There are &s;ome people that may be &s;aid to wear always &s;pectacles of ridi|cule, and &s;ee every thing through them: 'tis not &s;o much the fault of objects as the fault <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er&s;ons that view them in &s;uch a light: This is &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> that &s;uch per&s;ons as appear ridiculous in cert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mpanies, would be admired in others, where there are men of &s;en&s;e and merit.</P>
<P>A man's humour too contributes much to the making him agreeable or otherwi&s;e; dark and &s;our humours, that have a &s;pice of malevolence in them, are va&s;tly di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>Humour is the di&s;po&s;ition with which the &s;oul re|ceives the impre&s;&s;ion of objects; good-natured tem|pers take nothing ill; their indulgence is of benefit to others, and &s;upplies them with what they want in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The generality of mankind imagine, that it is to no purpo&s;e to attempt to correct their humour; they &s;ay 'I was born &s;o,' and fancy this excu&s;e is enough to ju&s;tify their not taking any pains about it. Such tempers mu&s;t infallibly di&s;plea&s;e; men owe you nothing, any farther than you are agreeable to them. The way to be &s;o is to forget one's &s;elf, to put others upon &s;ubjects which they like, to make them plea&s;ed with them&s;elves, to &s;et them out with advantage, and allow them the good qualities which others di&s;|pute their having. They believe you give them what the world does not allow them: Their merit &s;eems in &s;ome &s;ort to be of your creation, whil&s;t you exalt them in the opinion of others: But this is ne|ver to be pu&s;hed &s;o far as to commence flattery.</P>
<P>Nothing plea&s;es &s;o much as &s;en&s;ible tender per&s;ons trying to make a friend&s;hip with others.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="025064_0126_0FCE4926E04C9DA0">Take care to carry your&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, that your behaviour may at once make a tender of your own friend&s;hip, and invite the friend&s;hip of others. You can never be an amiable man without knowing how to be a friend, without a ta&s;te and knowledge of friend&s;hip. 'Tis this corrects the vi|ces of &s;ociety; it &s;oftens the roughne&s;s of people's natures; it brings down their vanity, and makes them know them&s;elves.

<P>In the hurry and bu&s;tle of the world, take care, my &s;on, to have a &s;ure friend to whi&s;per truth to your &s;oul: Be always ready to hear the ad|vice of your friends. The owning of faults is no hard matter for per&s;ons that find a fund within them|&s;elves to mend them: Think that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">u have never done enough, when you find that you can &s;till do better. No body takes a reproof &s;o kindly as he that de&s;erves mo&s;t to be commended. If you are happy enough to find a true friend, you have found a trea&s;ure; his reputation will &s;ecure your own: He will an&s;wer for you to your&s;elf; he will alleviate all your troubles, and multiply all your plea&s;ures. But if you would de&s;erve a friend, you mu&s;t know how to be one.</P>
<P>All the world is complaining of the want of friends, and yet &s;carce any body gives him&s;elf the trouble of bringing the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;po&s;itions to gain and pre&s;erve them. Young men have their companions, but they very rarely have any friends: Plea&s;ures are what unite them, but plea|&s;ures are not ties worthy of friend&s;hip.

<P>If you would be perfectly an hone&s;t man, you mu&s;t think of keeping your&s;elf within bounds, and placing it on a good object. Hone&s;ty con|&s;i&s;ts in waiving one's own rights, and paying a re|gard to tho&s;e of others. If you &s;et up to be hap|py alone, you will never be &s;o; all the world will di&s;pute your happine&s;s with you: but if you are for making the world happy as well as your&s;elf every body will a&s;&s;i&s;t you. All vices whatever flatter &s;elf-love, and all the virtues agree to at|tack it; valour expo&s;es it; mode&s;ty lowers it; genero&s;ity throws it away; moderation mortifies it; and zeal for the public &s;acrifices it to the good of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Self-love is a preferring of one's &s;elf to others&punc; as hone&s;ty is the preferring of others to one's &s;elf. There are two kinds of &s;elf-love; the one natu|ral, lawful, and regulated by ju&s;tice and rea&s;on; the other vicious and corrupt. Our fir&s;t object is certainly our&s;elves; 'tis only reflection that calls us back to ju&s;tice. We don't know how to love our&s;elves; we either carry our &s;elf-love too high, or exerci&s;e it improperly. To love one's &s;elf as one ought is to love virtue; to love vice is to &s;trike in with a blind and mi&s;taken love.</P>
<P>We have &s;ometimes &s;een per&s;ons advance them|&s;elves by ill ways; but if vice is preferred, it is not for any length of time; corrupt per&s;ons ruin them&s;elves by the very means, and with the &s;ame principles that rai&s;ed them. If you would be happy with &s;ecurity, you mu&s;t be &s;o with inno|cence.

There is no power &s;ure and la&s;ting but that of virtue.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome amiable tempers that have a fine and natural congruity with virtue: Tho&s;e to whom nature has not been &s;o bountiful mu&s;t be watchful over their conduct, and know their true intere&s;t, to be able to correct an evil di&s;po&s;ition. Thus the un|der&s;tanding rectifies the heart.</P>
<P>The love of e&s;teem is the life and &s;oul of &s;o|ciety; it unites us to one another: I want your ap|probation, you &s;tand in need of mine. By for&s;aking the conver&s;e of men, we for&s;ake the virtues nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ociety; for when one is alone, one is apt to grow negligent; the world forces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to have a guard over your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Politene&s;s is the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary quality for con|ver&s;ation; 'tis the art of employing the exterior marks of breeding, which after all gives us no a&s;&s;ur|ance of a man's inward qualities. Politene&s;s is an imitation of hone&s;ty, and &s;hews a man in his out<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ide, &s;uch as he ought to be within; it di&s;covers it&s;elf in every thing, in his air, in his di&s;cour&s;e, and in his ac|tions.</P>
<P>There is politene&s;s of under&s;tanding, and a polite|ne&s;s of manners: That of the under&s;tanding con&s;i&s;ts in &s;aying curious and ingenious things; that of man|ners, in &s;aying things of a flattering nature, and an agreeable turn.</P>
<P>I do not confine politene&s;s to that intercour&s;e of civilities and compliments, which is &s;ettled by common u&s;e; they are made without meaning, and received without any &s;en&s;e of obligation: People are apt to over-do the matter in this &s;ort of intercour&s;e, and abate of it upon expe|rience.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="025064_0129_0FCE492D2A4B2DD0">Politene&s;s is a de&s;ire to plea&s;e the per&s;ons with whom we are obliged to live, and to behave our|&s;elves in &s;uch a manner, that all the world may be &s;atisfied with us&punc; our &s;uperiors with our re&s;pects; our equals with our e&s;teem; and our inferiors with our kindne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion. In a word, it con&s;i&s;ts in a care to plea&s;e, and &s;ay what is proper to every body. It &s;ets out their good qualities; it makes them &s;en&s;ible that you acknowledge their &s;uperiority; when you know how to exalt them, they will &s;et you out in their turn; they will give you the &s;ame preference to others, which you are plea&s;ed to give them to your&s;elf, their &s;elf love obliges them to do &s;o.</P>
<P>The way to plea&s;e is not to di&s;play your &s;upe|riority; 'tis to conceal it from being perceived. There is a great deal of judgement in being po|lite; but the world will excu&s;e you at an ea&s;ier rate.</P>
<P>The generality of people require only certain manners that plea&s;e: if you have them not, you mu&s;t make up the defect with the number of your good qualities. There mu&s;t be a great deal of merit to get over a clowni&s;h awkward behaviour. Ne|ver let the world &s;ee that you are fond of your own per&s;on: A polite man never finds time to talk of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>You know what &s;ort of politene&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved to the women. At pre&s;ent it looks as if the young men had made a vow not to practi&s;e it, 'tis a &s;ign of a carele&s;s education.</P>
<P>Nothing is more &s;hameful than a voluntary rudene&s;s; but let them do their wor&s;t, they can never rob the women of the glory of having formed the fine&s;t gentlemen of the la&s;t age. 'Tis

to them that they owed all the complai&s;ance of behaviour, the delicacy of inclinations, and the fine gallantry of wit and manners which were then remarkable.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, indeed, exterior gallantry &s;eems to be bani&s;hed; the manners of the world are differ|ent, and every body has lo&s;t &s;omething by the change; the women the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, which was the &s;ource of their charms; and the men the complai&s;ance and fine politene&s;s, which is only to be acquired in their conver&s;ation. The generality of men fancy that they owe them neither probity nor fidelity: it looks as if they had a licence to betray them, without affecting their honour. Who|ever would think fit to examine into the motives of &s;uch a conduct, would find them very &s;canda|lous. They are faithful to one another, becau&s;e they are afraid, and know they &s;hall be called to an account; but they are fal&s;e to the women without fear of &s;uffering, and without remor&s;e. This &s;hews their probity to be only forced, to be rather the effect of fear than the love of ju&s;tice: and accordingly, if we examine clo&s;e into &s;uch as make a trade of gallantry, we &s;hall find them fre|quently to be men of no honour; they contract ill habits; their manners are corrupted: they grow indifferent to truth, and indulge them&s;elves in their habitual neglect of their word and oaths.</P>
<P>What a trade is this! where the lea&s;t ill thing that you do, is to &s;educe the women from their duty, to di&s;honour &s;ome, to make others de&s;|pera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, where a &s;ure calamity is oftentimes all the recompence of a &s;incere and con&s;tant af|fection.</P>
<P>The men have no rea&s;on to find &s;o much fault with the women; for it is by them that they lo&s;e

their innocence. If we except &s;ome women that &s;eem de&s;tined to vice from their cradle, the re&s;t would live in a regular practice of their duty, if the men did not take pains to turn them from it: but, in &s;hort, 'tis their bu&s;ine&s;s to be on their guard again&s;t them. You know that it is never allowable to di&s;honour them; if they have had the weakne&s;s to tru&s;t you with their honour, 'tis a confidence that you ought not to abu&s;e. You owe it to them, if you have rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with them; you owe it to your&s;elf, if you have rea&s;on to compain of them. You know, too that by the laws of honour you mu&s;t fight with equal weapons; you ought not therefore to expo&s;e a wo|man to di&s;honour for her amour, &s;ince &s;he can never expo&s;e you for yours.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t, however, caution you again&s;t incurring their hatred; it is violent and implacable. There are &s;ome offences which they never pardon, and people run a greater ri&s;k than they imagine, in wounding their honour; the le&s;s their re&s;entment breaks out, the more terrible is it; by being held in, it grows the fiercer. Have no quarrel with a &s;ex that knows &s;o well how to re&s;ent and revenge them&s;elves; and the rather, becau&s;e the women make the reputation of the men, as the men make that of the women.</P>
<P>'Tis a happy talent, but very rarely to be met with, to know how to manage the point of prai&s;e, to give it agreeably and with ju&s;tice. The moro&s;e man does not know how to prai&s;e&punc; his judgement is &s;poiled by his temper. The flatter, by prai|&s;ing too much, ruins his own credit, and does ho|nour to nobody.

An hone&s;t man prai&s;es in the right place: he feels more plea&s;ure in doing ju&s;tice, than in rai&s;ing his own reputation by le&s;&s;ening that of others. Per&s;ons that reflect, and are nice upon this article, are very &s;en&s;ible of all the&s;e differences.

<P>One &s;hould know how to live with one's com|petitors; there is nothing more common than to wi&s;h to rai&s;e one's &s;elf above them, or to try to ruin them: But there is a much nobler conduct; 'tis never to attack them, and always &s;trive to exceed them in merit; 'tis a hand&s;ome action to yield them the place which you think is due to them.</P>
<P>An hone&s;t man chu&s;es rather to neglect his own fortune, than to fail in a point of ju&s;tice. Di&s;pute about glory with your&s;elf, and &s;trive to acquire new virtues, and to improve the merit of tho&s;e which you have already.</P>
<P>One mu&s;t be very cautious in the article of re|venge; it is often of u&s;e to make one's &s;elf fear|ed; but it is almo&s;t always dangerous to revenge one's &s;elf.

<P>The generality of mankind bring nothing into the intercour&s;e of life but their weakne&s;s, which &s;erves for &s;ociety. Hone&s;t men form an intimacy by their virtues, the ordinary &s;ort of men by their plea&s;ures, and villains by their crimes.</P>
<P>Good-fellow&s;hip and gaming have their exce&s;s and their dangers: Love has others peculiar to it&s;elf; there is no playing always with beauty; it &s;ometimes commands imperiou&s;ly.

To give up one's &s;elf to voluptuou&s;ne&s;s is to degrade one's nature.

<P>As for gaming, 'tis the de&s;truction of all deco|rum. The prince forgets his dignity at it, and the woman her mode&s;ty. Deep play carries with it all the &s;ocial vices.

<P>Keep your&s;elf from envy, 'tis the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;hameful pa&s;&s;ion in the world; it is always di&s;owned. Envy is the &s;hadow of glory, as glory is the &s;hadow of virtue. The grate&s;t &s;ign that a man is born with great qualities is to &s;ay, that he has no envy in his nature.</P>
<P>A man of quality can never be amiable with|out liberality. The covetous man cannot fail of being di&s;agreeable.

<P>Though liberality is a gift of nature, yet if we had a di&s;po&s;ition to the contrary vice, we might by good &s;en&s;e and reflection correct it.</P>

<P>Riches mu&s;t be immen&s;e, in order to be enti|tled to the fir&s;t place among the goods of life: they are indeed the fir&s;t object of the de&s;ires of the greate&s;t part of mankind; yet virtue, glory, and a great reputation, are va&s;tly preferable to all the gifts of fortune.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure of hone&s;t men is to do good, and relieve the mi&s;erable.

Deny your&s;elf &s;ome|thing to lay up a fund for your liberality; 'tis an excellent point of oeconomy, which naturally tends to advance you, and gain you a good cha|racter.</P>
<P>A great reputation is a great trea&s;ure. We mu&s;t not imagine that a great fortune is nece&s;&s;ary to enable one to do good; all the world can do it in their &s;everal &s;tations, with a little attention to them&s;elves, and others; fix this inclination in your heart, and you'll find wherewith to gratify it: occa&s;ions enough offer them&s;elves before you, and there are but too many unhappy per&s;ons that &s;oli|cit you.</P>
<P>Liberality di&s;tingui&s;hes it&s;elf in the manner of giving. The liberal man doubles the merit of a pre&s;ent by the good-will with which he makes it: the covetous wretch &s;poils it by his regret at part|ing with it. Liberality never ruined any body.

&s;upported by ju&s;tice, moderation, and integrity. Liberality is one of the duties of a noble birth. When you do good, you only pay a debt; but &s;till prudence is to govern you in &s;uch ca&s;es; the prin|ciples of profu&s;ene&s;s are not &s;hameful, but the con&s;e|quences of it are dangerous.</P>

<P>Con&s;ider with what view authority was fir&s;t in&s;tituted, and in what manner it &s;hould be exer|ci&s;ed; 'tis virtue, and the natural re&s;pect which the world pays to it, that made men con&s;ent to obedience.

<P>Take care to have thoughts and &s;entiments worthy of you. Virtue rai&s;es the dignity of man, and vice degrades him. If one was un|happy enough to want an hone&s;t heart, one ought for one's own intere&s;t to correct it: nothing makes a man truly valuable but his heart, and nothing but that can make him happy; &s;ince our happine&s;s depends only on the nature of our in|clinations. If they are &s;uch as lead you to trifling pa&s;&s;ions, you will be the &s;port of their vain attachments: they offer you
<Q>flowers; but always (as Montaigne &s;ays) mi&s;tru&s;t the trea|chery of your plea&s;ures.</Q></P>
<P>We mu&s;t not indulge our&s;elves long in things that plea&s;e us; the moment that we give our|&s;elves up to them, we lay the foundation of our &s;orrows. The generality of mankind employ the fir&s;t part of their life in making the re&s;t of it mi&s;erable. You mu&s;t not abandon rea&s;on in your plea&s;ures, if you would find it again in your troubles.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, keep a &s;trict guard over your heart; it is the &s;ource of innocence and happine&s;s. You
<PB N="135" REF="025064_0141_0FCE4943F73D9A00">
will not pay too dear for the freedom of your mind and heart, though you purcha&s;e it by the &s;acrifice of your plea&s;ures, as was the &s;aying of an ingenious ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. Never expect then to recon|cile &s;en&s;uality, with glory, or the charm of volup|tuou&s;ne&s;s with the recompence of virtue. How|ever, when you bid adieu to plea&s;ures, you will find in other things &s;atisfaction enough to make you amends. There are various &s;orts of it: Glory and truth have their plea&s;ures; they are the delights of the &s;oul and heart.</P>
<P>Learn likewi&s;e to reverence and &s;tand in awe of your&s;elf. The foundation of happine&s;s is laid in the peace of the mind, and &s;ecret te&s;timony of the con&s;cience. By the word con&s;cience, I mean the inward &s;en&s;e of a nice honour, which a&s;&s;ures you that you have nothing to reproach your&s;elf with. Again, how happy is it to know how to live with one's &s;elf, to renew your acquaintance there with plea&s;ure, and quit your&s;elf for a time with regret! The world then indeed is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to you; but take care it does not make you out of hu|mour with it. One mu&s;t not entertain an aver&s;ion for men; they will de&s;ert you when you de&s;ert them: You have &s;till occa&s;ion for them; you are not either of an age or profe&s;&s;ion to do without them; but when one knows how to live one's &s;elf as well as with the world, they are two plea|&s;ures that &s;upport one another.</P>
<P>A pa&s;&s;ion for glory may contribute greatly to your advancement and happine&s;s; but it may likewi&s;e make you unhappy and di&s;picable, if you know not how to govern it: 'tis the mo&s;t active and la&s;ting of all our inclinations. The love of glory is the la&s;t pa&s;&s;ion that quits us; but we mu&s;t not confound it with vanity. Vanity aims
<PB N="136" REF="025064_0142_0FCE494623D16F00">
at the approbation of other people; true glory at the &s;ecret te&s;timony of the con&s;cience. Endea|vour to gratify the pa&s;&s;ion that you have for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, make &s;ure of this inward te&s;timony; your tri|bunal is &s;eated in your own brea&s;t, why then &s;hould you &s;eek it el&s;ewhere? You can always be a judge of your own worth. Let men di&s;|pute your good qualities if they plea&s;e; as they do not know you, you can ea&s;ily con&s;ole your|&s;elf. It is not of &s;o much con&s;equence to be thought an hone&s;t man, as to be one. Such as do not mind the approbation of other people, but only aim at de&s;erving it, take the &s;ure&s;t way to obtain both. What affinity is there between the greatne&s;s of man, and the littlene&s;s of the things which make the &s;ubject of his glorying? There is nothing &s;o ill &s;uited as his dignity and the va|nity that he derives from an infinite number of trifling things: a glory &s;o ill-grounded &s;hews a great want of merit. Per&s;ons that are truly great are not &s;ubject to the infatuations of vain|glory.</P>
<P>One mu&s;t, if it be po&s;&s;ible, my &s;on be content with one's condition in the world: there is nothing more rare and valuable than to find per&s;ons that are &s;atisfied with it. 'Tis our own fault. There is no condition of life &s;o bad, but it has one good &s;ide. Every &s;ituation has its point of view; we &s;hould place it in that favourable light, and &s;hall find that it is not the fault of our &s;ituations, but purely our own. We have much more rea|&s;on to complain of our own temper than of for|tune. We lay all the blame upon events, when all the fault lies upon our own di&s;content; the evil is within us, let us not &s;eek for it any where el&s;e. By qualifying our temper, we often change
<PB N="137" REF="025064_0143_0FCE49478EA40430">
our fortune. It is much ea&s;ier for us to adju&s;t our&s;elves to things, than to adju&s;t things to our|&s;elves. A great application to find out a remedy frequently irritates the di&s;ea&s;e, and the imagina|tion con&s;pires with the pain to increa&s;e and for|tify it. A dwelling upon misfortunes renews them, by making them pre&s;ent to the mind. An u&s;ele&s;s &s;truggling to get out of our circum&s;tances, makes us &s;lower in contracting an acqaintance with them, which would make them &s;it ea&s;y on us. One mu&s;t always give way to misfortunes; have recour&s;e to patience: 'tis the only way to alleviate them.</P>
<P>If you would do your&s;elf ju&s;tice, you will be content with your &s;ituation. I dare &s;ay, that after the lo&s;s we have &s;uffered, if you had another mother you would be &s;till fuller of complaints. Reflect on the advantages of your condition, and you will be le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the difficulties of it. A wi&s;e man, in the &s;ame circum&s;tances with others, has more advantages, and feels fewer inconveniencies than they.</P>
<P>You may depend upon it that there is no con|dition, but has its troubles; 'tis the &s;ituation of human life; there is nothing pure and unblended in it. 'Tis to pretend to exempt one's &s;elf from the common law of our nature to expect a con|&s;tant happine&s;s. The very per&s;ons that you think the happie&s;t would hardly appear &s;o to you, if you knew the exact &s;ituation of their fortune or their heart. Tho&s;e that are rai&s;ed the highe&s;t are frequently the mo&s;t unhappy. With great em|ployments and vulgar maxims one is always re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y: 'tis not places, but rea&s;on that removes anxiety from the mind. If you are

wi&s;e, fortune can neither increa&s;e nor dimini&s;h your happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Judge by your&s;elf, and not by the opinions of others. Misfortunes and di&s;orders ari&s;e from fal&s;e judgments, fal&s;e judgments from our pa&s;&s;ions, and pa&s;&s;ions from our conver&s;ation with mankind; you always come from them more perfect than you were before. To weaken the impre&s;&s;ion that they make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pon you, and to moderate your de&s;ires and inquie|tudes, con&s;ider that time is continually running away with your pains as well as your plea&s;ures; that every moment, young as you are, carries off a part of your&s;elf, that all things are perpetually &s;inking into the aby&s;s of pa&s;t time, thence never to return again.</P>
<P>All that you &s;ee greate&s;t on earth meets with the very &s;ame treatment as your&s;elf. The ho|nours, the dignities, the precedences &s;ettled among men, are mere &s;hows and ceremonies, without any reality; do not imagine that they are qualities in|&s;eparable from their being. Thus ought you to con|&s;ider &s;uch as are above you; but take in your view likewi&s;e an infinite number of mi&s;erable wretches that are below you: the difference between you and them is owing only to chance, but pride and the great opinion we have of our&s;elves make us think that the good condition we are in is no more than our due, and con&s;ider every thing that we do not enjoy as a robbery of what &s;hould belong to us: you cannot but &s;ee plainly that nothing is more unrea&s;onable than &s;uch an imagination. Enjoy, my &s;on, the ad|vantages of your circum&s;tances; but &s;uffer patiently the inconveniencies that attend them: Con&s;ider that wherever there are men, there are unhappy creatures. Enlarge your mind, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;o far as to fore&s;ee and know all the accidents that can befall you. In a word, remember that a man's happine&s;s depends

<HEAD>LORD BURGHLEY's TEN PRECEPTS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SON ROBERT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE virtuous inclination of thy matchle&s;s mother, by who&s;e tender and goldly care thy infancy was governed, together with thy education under &s;o zealous and excellent a tutor, puts me in rather a&s;&s;urance than hope, that you are not ignorant of that <HI>&s;ummum bonum,</HI> which is only able to make thee happy as well in thy death as life; I mean, the true knowledge and wor&s;hip of thy Creator and Redeemer, without which all other things are vain and mi&s;erable: &s;o that, thy youth being guided by &s;o &s;ufficient a teacher, I make no doubt but he will furni&s;h thy life with divine and moral documents. Yet, that I may not ca&s;t off the care be&s;eeming a pa|rent towards his child, or that you &s;houlde&s;t have cau&s;e to derive thy whole felicity and wel|fare rather from others, than from whence thou received&s;t thy breath and being, I think it fit and agreeable to the affection I bear thee, to help thee with &s;uch rules and adverti&s;ements for the &s;quaring of thy life, as are rather gained by ex|perience than by much reading; to the end that entering into this exorbitant age, thou maye&s;t be
<PB N="144" REF="025064_0148_0FCE494EA37F6318">
the better prepared to &s;hun tho&s;e &s;candalous cour&s;es whereunto the world, and the lack of experience, may ea&s;ily draw thee. And becau&s;e I will not con|found thy memory&punc; I have reduced them in Ten Precepts; and, next unto Mo&s;es' Tables, if thou imprint them in thy mind, thou &s;halt reap the benefit, and I the content. And they are the&s;e following:</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="precept">
<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN it &s;hall plea&s;e God to bring thee to man's e&s;tate, u&s;e great providence and circum|&s;pection in chu&s;ing thy wife; for from thence will &s;pring all thy future good or evil: and it is an ac|tion of life, like unto a &s;tratagem of war, where|in a man can err but once. If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hy e&s;tate be good, match near home and at lei&s;ure; if weak, far off and quickly. Enquire diligently of her di&s;po&s;i|tion, and how her parents have been inclined in their youth. Let her not be poor, how generous &s;oever; for a man can buy nothing in the market with gentility. Nor choo&s;e a ba&s;e and uncomely creature altogether for wealth; for it will cau&s;e contempt in others, and loathing in thee. Nei|ther make choice of a dwarf, or a fool; for by the one thou &s;halt beget a race of pigmies, the other will be thy continual di&s;grace; and it will irke thee to hear her talk; for thou &s;halt find it to thy great grief, that there is nothing more ful&s;ome than a &s;he-fool.</P>
<P>And, touching the guiding of thy hou&s;e, let thy ho&s;pitality be moderate; and, according to the means of thy e&s;tate, rather plentiful than &s;paring, but not co&s;tly; for I never knew any man grow poor by keeping an orderly table.
<PB N="145" REF="025064_0149_0FCE4953311A86B0">
But &s;ome con&s;ume them&s;elves through &s;ecret vices, and their ho&s;pitality bears the blame. But ba|ni&s;h &s;wimi&s;h drunkards out of thine hou&s;e, which is a vice imparing health, con&s;uming much, and makes no &s;how. I never heard prai&s;e a&s;cribed to the drunkard, but for the well-bearing of his drink; which is a better commendation for a brewer's hor&s;e or a dray-man, than for either a gentleman or a &s;erving-man. Beware thou &s;pend not above three or four parts of thy revenues, nor above a third part of that in thy hou&s;e; for the other two parts will do no more than defray thy extraordinaries, which always &s;urmount the or|dinary by much: otherwi&s;e thou &s;halt live, like a rich beggar, in continual want. And the needy man can never live happily nor contentedly; for every di&s;a&s;ter makes him ready to mortgage or &s;ell; and that gentleman who &s;ells an acre of land &s;ells an ounce of credit: for gentility is nothing el&s;e but ancient riches; &s;o that if the foundation &s;hall at any time &s;ink, the building mu&s;t need follow. So much for the Fir&s;t Pre|cept.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="precept">
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<P>BRING thy children up in learning and obe|dience, yet without outward au&s;terity. Prai&s;e them openly, reprehend them &s;ecretly. Give them good countenance and convenient mainte|nance according to thy ability, otherwi&s;e thy life will &s;eem their bondage; and what portion thou &s;halt leave them at thy death, they will thank Death for it, and not thee. And I am per&s;uaded that the fooli&s;h cockering of &s;ome parents, and the over-&s;tern carriage of others, cau&s;eth more men and women to take ill cour&s;es, than their own vicious inclinations. Marry thy daughters

Neither, by my con&s;ent, &s;halt thou train them up in wars; for he that &s;ets up his re&s;t to live by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fe&s;&s;ion, can hardly be an hone&s;t man or a good chri&s;tian: be&s;ides, it is a &s;cience no longer in reque&s;t than u&s;e; for &s;oldiers in peace are like chimneys in &s;ummer.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="precept">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>LIVE not in the country without corn and cattle about thee; for he that putteth his hand to the pur&s;e for every expence of hou&s;hold, is like him that keepeth water in a &s;ieve: and what provi&s;ion thou &s;halt want, learn to buy it at the be&s;t hand; for there is one penny &s;aved in four, betwixt buy|ing in the need, and when the markets and &s;ea|&s;ons &s;erve fitte&s;t for it. Be not &s;erved with kin&s;|men, or friends, or men intreated to &s;tay; for they expect much, and do little: nor with &s;uch as are amorous; for their heads are intoxicated. And keep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther too few, than one too many. Feed them well, and pay them with the mo&s;t; and then thou maye&s;t boldly require &s;ervice at their hands.</P>

<P>LET thy kindred and allies be welcome to thy hou&s;e and table.

<P>UUDERTAKE no &s;uit again&s;t a poor man with|out receiving much wrong; for, be&s;ides that thou make&s;t him thy compeer, it is a ba&s;e conque&s;t to triumph where there is &s;mall re&s;i&s;tance.

Towards thine inferiors &s;hew much huma|nity, and &s;ome familiarity; as to bow the body, &s;tretch forth the hand, and to uncover the head, with &s;uch like popular compliments. The fir&s;t prepares thy way to advancement: the &s;econd makes thee known for a man well bred: the third gains a good report, which, once got, is ea&s;ily kept; for right humanity takes &s;uch deep root in the minds of the multitude, as they are more ea&s;ily gained by unprofitable courte&s;ies than by churli&s;h benefits. Yet I advi&s;e thee not to affect or neglect popularity too much. Seek not to be E&s;&s;ex: &s;hun to be Raleigh.</P>

<P>TRUST not any man with thy life, credit, or e&s;tate; for it is mere folly for a man to enthrall him&s;elf to a friend, as though, occa&s;ion being of|fered, he &s;hould not dare to become thine enemy.</P>
