<HEAD>REMARKS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE bill, which originated in the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania has wi&s;ely directed, that, "To the end that laws, before they are enacted, may be more maturely con&s;idered, and the inconvenience of ha&s;ty determinations as much as po&s;&s;ible prevented, all bills of a public nature &s;hall be printed for the con&s;ideration of the people, before they are read in general a&s;&s;embly the la&s;t time for debate and amendment; and, except on occa&s;ions of &s;udden nece&s;&s;ity, &s;hall not be pa&s;&s;ed into laws, until the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of a&s;&s;embly."</NOTE> la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of a&s;&s;embly, for repealing the law whereby a charter of incorporation is granted to the bank in this city, under the name of the Bank of North-America, will be taken up, in a few days, for its final deci&s;ion. It re&s;pects an object of great and general concern; and requires the &s;erious con|&s;ideration of every member of the legi&s;latre.</P>
<P>A gentleman, well known for his <HI>profe&s;&s;ional</HI> abilities, has undertaken to advocate the cau&s;e of the bank, in a pamphlet, ju&s;t publi&s;hed, entitled&mdash;"Con&s;iderations on the Bank of North&punc;America." He has gone fully into the defence of this in&s;titution; and has pleaded for his client with his u&s;ual ingenuity.</P>
<P>The writer of the following &s;trictures a&s;&s;ures the public, that he has no inducement to take up his pen, on the oc|ca&s;ion, but to offer his candid, unbia&s;&s;ed &s;entiments, on the &s;ubject to which they relate. He has to lament, that &s;o little time is afforded him for the purpo&s;e: and this, he begs, may be accepted as his apology, for not going more fully into the matter.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t po&s;ition, which the author of the Ob&s;ervations endeavours to e&s;tabli&s;h, is&mdash;"That the Bank of North-America was <HI>legally and Con&s;titutionally</HI> in&s;tituted and or|ganized, by the charter of incorporation granted by the <HI>United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="019217_0004_0FAA640E6A4EA870">
This we deny&mdash;The &s;econd article of the confederation declares. in <HI>expre&s;s</HI> terms, that "Each &s;tate retains its &s;overeignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, juri&s;diction and right, which is not by this confederation <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> delegated to the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;|&s;embled."&mdash;The right of creating a corporation appertains to &s;overeignty; and every &s;tate in the union, by virtue of this right, exerci&s;es the power. It is a power ve&s;ted in the legi&s;lature of each &s;tate. We find that, in <HI>England,</HI> though a monarchy, the power of erecting corporations, is a <HI>right of parliament.</HI> It is true, the king <HI>al&s;o</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;es this power: but it &s;eems to be rather a <HI>permi&s;&s;ive</HI> pre|rogative of the &s;overeign, which he, as a con&s;tituent part of the parliament, has the <HI>privilege</HI> of exerting; not|with&s;tanding the forced con&s;truction, in favour of <HI>preroga|tive,</HI> which Judge Black&s;tone makes, in his ob&s;ervations on this privilege (though not an <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> one) of the crown&mdash;"The method," &s;ays the learned Judge, "by which the king's con&s;ent (to the erection of any corporation) is expre&s;sly given, are either by <HI>act of parliament</HI> or char|ter. By <HI>act of parliament,</HI> of which the royal a&s;&s;ent is a nece&s;&s;ary ingredient, <HI>corporations may undoubtedly be created:</HI> but it is ob&s;ervable, that mo&s;t of the&s;e &s;tatutes, which are u&s;ually cited as having created corporations, do either <HI>con|firm</HI> &s;uch as have been before created by the king, as in the ca&s;e of the College of Phy&s;icians, erected by charter, 10. Henry VIII&mdash;<HI>Which charter was afterward confirmed in parliament;</HI> or they PERMIT the <HI>king</HI> to erect a corpo|ration <HI>in futuro,</HI> with &s;uch and &s;uch powers, as is the ca&s;e of the BANK OF ENGLAND, and the &s;ociety of the Briti&s;h fi&s;hery. So that the <HI>immediate</HI> creative act is u&s;ually per|formed by the King alone, in virtue of his royal prero|gative."&mdash;The foregoing quotation naturally &s;ugge&s;ts the idea of a di&s;tinction, with re&s;pect to corporations by <HI>char|ter</HI> in England, between the "immediate creative act," by the <HI>king,</HI> and a <HI>&s;ub&s;equent confirmation in parliament.</HI> This idea will apply to a charter granted by CONGRESS; its immediate <HI>creation</HI> may be by them; but, to give it <HI>operation,</HI> it mu&s;t be <HI>confirmed</HI> by the &s;everal &s;tates. So far, and no farther, do the powers of Congre&s;s extend, as to the erecting of corporations. And it is evident this
<PB N="5" REF="019217_0005_0FAA6410AC89C778">
was the idea of the matter, entertained by that body, when they <HI>recommended</HI> to the legi&s;lature of <HI>each</HI> &s;tate, "to pa&s;s &s;uch laws as they might judge <HI>nece&s;&s;ary for giving the ordinance incorporating the bank its</HI> FULL OPERA|TION." By the 9th &s;ection of the con&s;titution of this commonwealth, there is an expre&s;s confirmation of the power of the legi&s;lature, "to grant charters of incorpo|ration." The exerci&s;e of this power is an act of "&s;ove|reignty;" and as it is <HI>not,</HI> by the articles of confederati|on, "<HI>expre&s;sly</HI> delegated to the United States in Con|gre&s;s a&s;&s;embled," the <HI>"right"</HI> to exerci&s;e it is <HI>exclu&s;ively</HI> ve&s;ted in the legi&s;latures of the &s;everal &s;tates. Nor can any <HI>implication</HI> operate to the extinction of this right, by giving Congre&s;s any other power, in this ca&s;e, than &s;uch as is above defined.</P>
<P>But, could we, for a moment, &s;uppo&s;e, that Congre&s;s has a power of <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hing</HI> corporations, we mu&s;t admit that &s;oleci&s;m in politics, <HI>imperium in imperio.</HI> For could they not in&s;titute a corporation, who&s;e objects might, to u&s;e the words of the author of the "Ob&s;ervations," be&mdash;"commen&s;urate to the United States"&mdash;who&s;e opera|tions would extend through all&mdash;and who&s;e principles, pro|ceedings and police might interfere with the laws and con&s;titutions of individual &s;tates?&mdash;<HI>Such</HI> a power, Con|gre&s;s neither po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es nor claims: And though the autho|rity and power of that truly honourable and re&s;pectable body are, without doubt, in many in&s;tances, incompetent to the di&s;charge of the high and important duties annexed to their office; it is to be pre&s;umed, that no man will &s;e|riou&s;ly contend for the propriety of granting them <HI>this</HI> prerogative. "Cities and towns" (&s;ays Judge Black|&s;tone, I. 472. note <HI>h.</HI>) "were fir&s;t erected into corporate communities on the Continent, and endowed with many valuable privileges, about the eleventh century: to which the <HI>con&s;ent</HI> of the feodal <HI>&s;overeign</HI> was <HI>ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, as many of his prerogatives and revenues were thereby con&s;i|derably dimini&s;hed"</HI>&mdash;If the Bank of North-America is to be con&s;idered as a body corporate within the Common|wealth of Penn&s;ylvania, without the "con&s;ent" of the legi&s;lature, which is the &s;overeign power of the &s;tate; is not an <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> "prerogative" of the &s;tate infringed&mdash;And
<PB N="6" REF="019217_0006_0FAA6411EB1DFE90">
may not its "revenues" be "con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed" by many of its citizens ve&s;ting their funds in an in&s;tituti|on, within the heart of the &s;tate, <HI>&s;olely</HI> "under the <HI>autho|rity</HI> and au&s;pices of <HI>Congre&s;s,</HI>" and not am enable to the laws of any &s;ingle &s;tate?&mdash;Might not Congre&s;s, on the &s;ame principles, incorporate an Ea&s;t-India Company, and grant them great and exclu&s;ive privileges, with an exemp|tion of their imports from all duties and impo&s;ts what|&s;oever?</P>
<P>The author of the Ob&s;ervations a&s;&s;erts&mdash;That "STATES are <HI>corporations,</HI> or bodies politic, of the mo&s;t important and dignified kind." "New &s;tates, &s;ays he, "mu&s;t be FORMED and e&s;tabli&s;hed; their extent and boundaries mu&s;t be regulated and a&s;certained"&mdash;And then a&s;ks&mdash;"How can this be done, unle&s;s by the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled."</P>
<P>To this we reply&mdash;That &s;tates <HI>re&s;emble</HI> corporations in their nature and properties; and, in &s;ome re&s;pects, may be con&s;idered as &s;uch. The <HI>territory,</HI> on which the <HI>new</HI> &s;tates are to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, was ceded to the United States, in con&s;equence of a <HI>treaty</HI> between Congre&s;s and the original proprietors of the &s;oil; the right of "enter|ing into treaties" being ve&s;ted in Congre&s;s, by the 9th article of the confederation. But, neither the acqui&s;ition of the lands, nor the regulating and a&s;certaining "their extent and boundaries," con&s;titute the act of incorporat|ing&mdash;<HI>People</HI> are the nece&s;&s;ary ingredient, (if we may u&s;e the term) which enter into the compo&s;ition of a body politic: And Congre&s;s do no more than declare, that the <HI>&s;ettlers</HI> on the&s;e lands &s;hould, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> in&s;tance, be authorized "to meet together, for the purpo&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hing a <HI>tem|porary</HI> government," FOR THEMSELVES&mdash;and, on an in|crea&s;e of their numbers, "to e&s;tabli&s;h a <HI>permanent con&s;titu|tion and government,</HI> FOR THEMSELVES."&mdash;<HI>They</HI> are to incorporate, or rather confederate <HI>them&s;elves:</HI> Congre&s;s has nothing to do with their <HI>incorporation</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author of the Ob&s;ervations &s;eems to have derived his idea of the new &s;tates being <HI>corporations,</HI> from Congre&s;s having declared that their re&s;olutions, (re&s;pecting, among other articles, the manner in which the inhabitants of tho&s;e &s;tates are to adopt and afterwards form a government and con&s;titution "for them&s;elves") "&s;hall be formed into a CHARTER of <HI>compact,</HI> &amp;c." A <HI>charter</HI> is defined to be&mdash;"An in&s;trument, or written evidence, of a thing, under the &s;eal of a prince" (or &s;overeign power) "whereby he makes a <HI>grant</HI> to a per&s;on, or community, of &s;ome particular and exclu&s;ive privileges, under certain limitations." And, according to Black&s;tone (I. fol. 45) a <HI>compact</HI> is a promi&s;e proceeding <HI>from</HI> us. The union of the&s;e two words, therefore, cannot be con&s;trued to mean, in this in&s;tance, a charter of <HI>incorporation&mdash;nothing</HI> is <HI>granted to</HI> the inhabitants of the new &s;tates&mdash;<HI>emption</HI> gives them a right to the <HI>&s;oil;</HI> and they enjoy an <HI>inherent</HI> right to frame, "for them&s;elves" a <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> and to admi|ni&s;ter their government&mdash;Congre&s;s <HI>recognize</HI> this inherent right. Black&s;tone, treating of the <HI>charter governments,</HI> dependent on the Briti&s;h crown, which formerly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in America, &s;ays&mdash;they were "in the nature of civil <HI>corporations</HI>&mdash;with &s;uch rights and authorities, as were <HI>&s;pecially given them,</HI> in their &s;everal <HI>charters of incorporation.</HI>" The very idea of a <HI>corporation</HI> &s;uppo&s;es its <HI>dependence</HI> on &s;ome <HI>higher</HI> power, which cannot apply to &s;overeign, independent &s;tates:&mdash;And, conformably to this opinion, it is ob&s;erved by Dr. Turnbull (in his notes to Heineccius &s;y&s;tem of univer&s;al law) that, "a multitude of people, united under a common magi&s;tracy; but &s;ubjected to a large Kingdom or republic, does not properly come under the name of a <HI>republic,</HI> but a <HI>town incorporate.</HI>"&mdash;The ju&s;t and proper &s;ignification of CHARTER OF COMPACT, in the ca&s;e before us, is&mdash;a written evi|dence or "promulgated" te&s;timony, <HI>prior</HI> to the laying off and &s;ettling the new &s;tates, that the inhabitants thereof &s;hall be con&s;idered as citizens of the American confederated republic;&mdash;under which <HI>compact</HI> or declaratory promi&s;e, and &s;ubject to which condition, &s;uch per&s;ons as may choo&s;e to become inhabitants of tho&s;e new &s;tates, will owe allegeance to, and be entitled to protection from, the <HI>confederacy of all the &s;tates:</HI> and that certain articles, con&s;tituting the &s;aid charter of compact, "&s;hall &s;tand as <HI>fundamental con&s;titutions</HI> between the thirteen <HI>original</HI> &s;tates, and each of the &s;everal <HI>&s;tates now newly de&s;cribed.</HI>"</NOTE>, having no agen|cy in <HI>this</HI> part of the formation of the new &s;tates.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="019217_0007_0FAA641212833A30">
To what has been &s;aid on this &s;ubject, we &s;ubjoin the &s;en&s;e of the <HI>Council of Cen&s;ors,</HI> relative thereto.&mdash;"By the fir&s;t &s;ection of the act of a&s;&s;embly to incorporate the Bank of North-America, pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t of April, 1782, the claim of Congre&s;s to erect incorporations is acknowledged.&mdash;Yet there is <HI>no countenance</HI> given to this a&s;&s;umed authority by the <HI>confederation.</HI>"</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments, we conceive, are &s;ufficient to &s;hew the futility of the a&s;&s;ertion&mdash;"That the Bank of North-America was <HI>legally and con&s;titutionally</HI> in&s;tituted and or|ganized by the <HI>charter of incorporation</HI> granted by the Unit|ed States in <HI>Congre&s;s</HI> a&s;&s;embled."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="019217_0008_0FAA64133300CB10">
On what ba&s;is, then, does this in&s;titution &s;tand?&mdash;It will not be &s;eriou&s;ly contended, that any &s;ingle &s;tate in the union has a right to exerci&s;e a legi&s;lative power over any one or more of the others; nor that twelve &s;tates, out of Congre&s;s, have authority to bind a thirteenth <HI>in any ca&s;e what&s;oever.</HI>&mdash;The re&s;ult, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, is&mdash;that the <HI>validity</HI> of the incorporation of the bank depends on the exi&s;tence of a law of this &s;tate, entitled, "An act to incorporate the &s;ub&s;cribers to the Bank of North-America."</P>
<P>This point being e&s;tabli&s;hed, it follows, as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, that the a&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania have a <HI>right</HI> to di&s;&s;olve the corporation of the bank. "<HI>A corpo|ration</HI> (&s;ays Judge Black&s;tone, I. 485) <HI>may be di&s;&s;olved by act of parliament,</HI> which is boundle&s;s in its operations." The power of <HI>repealing</HI> its own laws, is a right inherent in every legi&s;lative body&mdash;it is a right exerci&s;ed by the <HI>freemen of Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> through the medium their repre|&s;entatives, <HI>for the benefit of the whole community;</HI> and therefore it cannot, with any rea&s;on, be &s;uppo&s;ed, that "acts of the &s;tate" exerting that right, will be directed by "every varying gu&s;t of politics." The mo&s;t ab&s;olute and explicit terms of <HI>perpetuity,</HI> as to the force and ope|ration of a law, cannot militate again&s;t this right: for to &s;uppo&s;e the contrary, would, in effect, be to infer&mdash;either, that the legi&s;lature can do no wrong; or that, having once gone into an error, the people mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubmit to the con&s;equences, be they what they may, without any means of obtaining redre&s;s&mdash;The ab&s;urdity of &s;uch doctrine is too glaring, to need any comment; it being &s;ufficiently exemplified in the in&s;tance before us, of a legi&s;lative body erecting a <HI>public bank</HI> into a <HI>perpetual corporation</HI>&mdash;a thing unprecedented in any free country!</P>
<P>The right of the legi&s;lature, to di&s;&s;olve the corporation of the bank, being a&s;certained, our next enquiry &s;hall be&mdash;as to the <HI>expediency</HI> of the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>We &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, as conci&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible that the Bank is an in&s;titution incompatible with the inte|re&s;t and welfare of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>High intere&s;t for money is allowed, by all writers, to be extremely prejudicial to every country where it obtains.
<PB N="9" REF="019217_0009_0FAA6413AD8194F8">
It is alike unfavourable to the farmer, merchant and trade&s;|man. In a country, where the principal &s;ource of their wealth is agriculture and the lands are in a &s;tate of progre&s;|&s;ive improvement, with a proportionable increa&s;e of trade, manufactures and people, every man mu&s;t &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of a circulating medium being kept up, in a due ratio to the&s;e increa&s;ing u&s;es and demands for money. Such a country is <HI>this:</HI> But the balance of trade being again&s;t it, <HI>that</HI> balance mu&s;t be paid in gold and &s;ilver; and as the addition made to the circulating medium by the bank, mu&s;t bear a certain rea&s;onable proportion to its <HI>limited</HI> and <HI>fixed capital,</HI> which cannot be enlarged, &s;o as to keep pace with the growing pecuniary u&s;es, there mu&s;t be a <HI>progre&s;|&s;ive diminution</HI> of the circulating medium of the country; operating again&s;t its intere&s;t, in a <HI>compound</HI> ratio to the <HI>in|crea&s;ing u&s;es and demands</HI> for money: unle&s;s, indeed, <HI>other paper,</HI> be&s;ides that of the bank, be thrown into circulati|on, as a medium of alienation; which would be contrary to <HI>their</HI> intere&s;t. This effect will be produced by the <HI>high rate of money;</HI> whereby none can po&s;&s;ibly be benefited, but the &s;tockholders them&s;elves, and an incon&s;iderable number of merchants and traders: while the <HI>farmer</HI> is deprived of acce&s;s to &s;uch &s;ums, as are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, towards enabling him to cultivate and improve his lands, in &s;uch a manner, as to contribute to his own emolument and the wealth of his country; otherwi&s;e than on terms totally in|con&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e purpo&s;es. In what manner will this operate? In facilitating the importation of foreign commo|dities; preventing the &s;ettling and improvement of the lands; di&s;couraging emigration of u&s;eful citizens hither, from abroad; and expediting the tran&s;portation of gold and &s;ilver to other countries. The great emoluments which would accrue from banking, under the&s;e circum|&s;tances would induce men of <HI>moderate monied</HI> property, as well as the rich, to ve&s;t their funds in bank-&s;tock, to the di&s;couragement of indu&s;try. And, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and to a &s;imilar effect, would the occupier of a <HI>landed</HI> e&s;tate convert it into ca&s;h, in order to become a proprietor in the funds of the bank; that he might draw an intere&s;t of eight or ten per cent. per annum for his money, without any la|bour, and &s;ubject to no taxes. The&s;e allurements might

continue for &s;ome con&s;iderable time; probably long enough to &s;uffer a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of great holders of &s;tock to acquire independent fortunes, from the accumulation of <HI>intere&s;t upon intere&s;t every &s;ix months.</HI> But, finally, all the circulating &s;pecie of the country mu&s;t center in the bank, and, whil&s;t one of its notes remains in circulation, will be drawn out to di&s;charge the grand balance of our trade with foreign countries, till the whole &s;hall be exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>The <HI>influence</HI> of the bank is not le&s;s to be dreaded, than its dangerous tendency in other re&s;pects. By the act of a&s;&s;embly for incorporating the &s;ub&s;cribers to the bank, they are "declared and made able and capable in law to have, purcha&s;e, receive, po&s;&s;e&s;s, enjoy and retain lands, rents, tenements, hereditaments, goods<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bank of England is, by its charter, <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> re&s;tricted from <HI>trading,</HI> or &s;uffering any per&s;on or per&s;ons, <HI>in tru&s;t for them,</HI> to trade with any of the effects of the corporation, in the buying or &s;elling of <HI>any merchandize or goods;</HI> except in buying or &s;elling gold or &s;ilver bullion, or in &s;elling goods mortgaged to them and not redeemed in due time.

The intere&s;t of the &s;tate requires a <HI>paper cur|rency,</HI> for the encouragement of the <HI>farmer;</HI> but this would dimini&s;h the profits of the &s;tockholders, and therefore they will continue to oppo&s;e it. Here, then, is an interference of intere&s;ts between the <HI>&s;tate</HI> and a <HI>mercantile corporation.</HI> To de&s;troy this competition, the latter will naturally be led to exert its utmo&s;t <HI>influence:</HI> and, when we con&s;ider of what <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>extent</HI> this INFLUENCE may be;&mdash;e&s;pe|cially when exerci&s;ed by men who &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves, in their corporate capacity, <HI>free from the control of the laws;</HI> and who, po&s;&s;ibly, may be aliens and even enemies, or under the direction of &s;uch;&mdash;what may not be its effects?&mdash;what have we not to fear?</P>
<P>The people of England, ever jealous of their liberties, were alarmed at the parliament extending the duration of the charter of their national bank <HI>only ten years</HI> beyond its u&s;ual term of <HI>twenty one!</HI> what &s;ays Mr. David Hartley on that occa&s;ion (in his letter, dated 22d. June, 1782) to the Lord Mayor of London?&mdash;"The e&s;tabli&s;hment of a monopoly in any corporation, immen&s;e in its magnitude, of the duration of thirty-one years," (the duration of the Bank of North-America is to ETERNITY) "&s;ituated in the very heart of the city of London, which is the heart of the kingdom, and which may, by that e&s;tabli&s;hment, be enabled to control the whole national powers of public and private credit, is an object mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly de&s;erving the attention of the city of London"&mdash;"A &s;tate bank &s;hould be the &s;er|vant of the &s;tate, QUAMDIU SE BENE GESSERIT, and under the control of a lea&s;e of moderate duration. Tho&s;e who give power out of their own hands, are re&s;pon&s;ible for any &s;ub&s;equent u&s;urparions or encroachments which <HI>may</HI> follow."&mdash;"If they were upon any &s;udden occa&s;ion, or up|on any pre&s;&s;ing emergence of the &s;tate, <HI>to refu&s;e the ordinary circulation</HI> of land or malt bills, <HI>or of any other articles of</HI>

<HI>public &s;upply,</HI> they might have it in their power to control all the executive faculties of the &s;tate, and to fetter, by their exclu&s;ive negative all their vigorous and financial ope|rations. The extremes likewi&s;e, on the other hand, would be equally in their power. If any daring mini&s;ter hereafter &s;hould meditate &s;ome deep de&s;ign, and &s;hould extend the <HI>influence and powers of corruption</HI> over &s;ome unknown future &s;et of twenty-four bank directors"(the Bank of North America has but twelve) "the immen&s;e power of their monopoly, thus liberated from fear or control for an age to come, might become the mo&s;t formidable engine of &s;tate; even &s;o far, po&s;&s;ibly, as by &s;ome de&s;perate &s;troke to render the executive power independent on the knowlege or con|&s;ent of parliament, for any required &s;um of money." And farther. "If, unfortunately, in any future period in this country, vehement factions &s;hould ari&s;e, and that the bank &s;hould, incidentally, become an engine in the hands of any one party, to wreak their vengeance upon their ad|ver&s;aries, might not <HI>&s;ome</HI> men be prefered to partial favor, while others of equal merit might be pro&s;cribed to bank|ruptcy? Let every merchant and banker in the city of London apply this ca&s;e to his own thoughts, whether he would wi&s;h to &s;et it merely on a ca&s;t of lots, on who&s;e head favor or pro&s;cription &s;hould fall."</P>
<P>This is the language of Mr. Hartley.&mdash;We offer no apo|logy for the length of the quotations&mdash;They are <HI>in point</HI>&mdash;And every man, capable of judging, may draw the <HI>parallel,</HI> and determine, whether the&s;e remarks do not apply with equal force, if not greater, to the Bank of North America.</P>
<P>This bank, as well as that of England, is founded on the principles of <HI>mercantile credit.</HI> Sir James Steuart (in his "Political OEconomy") tells us&mdash;"The con&s;titution of the bank of England differs <HI>e&s;&s;entially,</HI> in &s;ome particulars, from that of <HI>banks upon mortgage and private credit.</HI> It is not &s;o much calculated for <HI>multiplying the currency</HI> by melt|ing down private property, as for <HI>facilitating the circulation of the trade of London, and</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"So early as 1706, the government of England began to borrow at &s;ix per cent. upon funds already engaged. What was the con&s;equence? The exchequer, <HI>having no money to pay the intere&s;t as it fell due,</HI> paid with tallies; the&s;e fell to <HI>great di&s;count.</HI> Upon this occa&s;ion, they availed them&s;elves of the bank of England.&mdash;They engaged the bank to di&s;count <HI>all</HI> tallies i&s;&s;ued for intere&s;t of debts: but as public credit was &s;o low that money could not be found to di&s;charge <HI>even the intere&s;t of the advance made by the bank,</HI> the <HI>government</HI> con&s;ented that all ad|vances of that kind &s;hould bear <HI>compound</HI> intere&s;t quarterly, at 6 per cent.&mdash;Had banks of circulation upon <HI>mortgage</HI> been e&s;tabli&s;hed at that time, money would have come in, at a moderate <HI>&s;imple</HI> intere&s;t, to in|dividuals, who would have evailed them&s;elves of them for the payment of all public burthens."&mdash;Steuarts Political Oeconomy, Vol. II.</NOTE> <HI>exchequer of Great Britain</HI>"

It is, &s;ays he, "more u&s;eful for promoting circulation, than <HI>augmenting</HI> it."&mdash;Where then are the great advanta|ges re&s;ulting to this country from the Bank of North-Ame|rica, to counterpoi&s;e its numerous and great di&s;advantages? "It is not much calculated for multiplying the currency." Nor has it te&s;tified any di&s;po&s;ition to <HI>co-operate</HI> with govern|ment, in the re&s;toration and &s;upport of <HI>public credit;</HI> as the bank of England has done: on the contrary, it has fully evinced its determination to <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> all paper but its own. The author of the ob&s;ervations has exhibited a li&s;t of monies advanced to the public by the bank&mdash;We wi&s;h not to de|tract from the merit of the bank: but, on enquiry, it will be found&mdash;that the&s;e &s;ums were advanced on ample &s;ecuri|ties; and that they received intere&s;t for the&s;e advances; altho they had the u&s;e of a &s;um not le&s;s than 16,000 dol|lars belonging to the &s;tate, ten or twelve months, without any charge. If the facts are otherwi&s;e, we wi&s;h to be &s;et right: they may be a&s;certained, without much difficulty.</P>
<P>On a review of what has been &s;aid, we apprehend it will be &s;ufficiently evident, that it would be "wi&s;e" and "po|litic" to repeal the charter granted by this &s;tate to the Bank of North-America; and that the legi&s;lature would be ju&s;tifiable, in &s;o doing, on every principle of equity, expediency, and duty.</P>
<P>It now remains for us to point out a proper &s;ub&s;titute for the bank&mdash;&s;ome in&s;titution, which &s;hall an&s;wer all the pur|po&s;es of a bank, <HI>&s;uited to this country;</HI> which &s;hall not be attended with the di&s;advantages and dangers of one, but adapted to promote the <HI>intere&s;ts of the whole community. Such</HI> an in&s;titution is a LOAN-OFFICE; on a footing &s;imilar to that which obtained in this &s;tate, prior to the revolution. This is, in fact, a <HI>&s;tate bank,</HI> and analogous,
<PB N="14" REF="019217_0014_0FAA641731283698">
in its operations, to a <HI>bank of circulation upon mortgage.</HI> A paper currency is emitted by government&mdash;This is <HI>loaned,</HI> (in &s;ums not exceeding, perhaps, two hundred pounds to any one per&s;on,) to proprietors of lands within this &s;tate; who mortgage <HI>real,</HI> &s;ub&s;tantial property, amounting to double or treble the value of the money borrowed by them, as a &s;ecurity for the repayment of the principal with inter|e&s;t, in fifteen or &s;ixteen years, in equal yearly portions.</P>
<P>The <HI>demands for money</HI> in every country, will be regulat|ed by its <HI>u&s;es:</HI> When the u&s;es are great, the demands will be &s;o; and &s;o, <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;,</HI> in proportion. The occupiers of the lands, in a new and unimproved country, have continu|al u&s;es for money, to &s;tock and improve their farms. With|out this, the &s;ettlers in an unimproved country can do no|thing; and the improvements of the partially-cultivated lands mu&s;t become &s;tationary, or advance but &s;lowly. But when the farmer is enabled to obtain money, on the fa|vourable terms of a loan-office he <HI>u&s;es</HI> it in extending the improvements of his farm; which improvements become, as it were, the <HI>capital &s;tock,</HI> from the employment of which he is enabled to repay, in the limited time, the principal &s;um borrowed; together with <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> which mu&s;t come out of the <HI>profits</HI> on his capital &s;tock.&mdash;For in&s;tance&mdash;"A farmer borrows, from a public loan-office, one hun|dred pounds, on a mortgage of lands double or treble in value; repayable, with intere&s;t, in &s;ixteen yearly in&s;talments. He pays &pound;.142 10, principal and intere&s;t, in that term. As this intire &s;um of one hundred pounds, in <HI>paper money,</HI> originally lent, mu&s;t be withdrawn from circulation by the &s;tate, at the expiration of the &s;ixteen years, the <HI>additional</HI> &s;um of &pound;.42 10, which the borrower will have then paid, will be produced by the u&s;e which he has had, during that term, of the <HI>average</HI> &s;um of &pound;.53 26, per annum, at an intere&s;t of five per centum. Therefore, the borrower of the original &s;um of &pound;.100, in the bills of credit, will, by the employment thereof, have created the additional &s;um of &pound;.42 10, in <HI>actual money.</HI> The <HI>principal</HI> will have been <HI>realized</HI> by the borrower in <HI>that improved value of his lands,</HI> which has furni&s;hed <HI>&s;uch intere&s;t;</HI> and <HI>that</HI> intere&s;t will have &s;upplied a <HI>fund for public u&s;es.</HI>"</P>
<P>Nothing is more evident, than, that the objects, which
<PB N="15" REF="019217_0015_0FAA641812CC0EB8">
create <HI>&s;uch</HI> u&s;es for money, are of the mo&s;t important kind: They promote, in the highe&s;t degree, the national wealth and pro&s;perity. The demands of the farmer, for money, will continue while he can apply it to &s;uch u&s;es with ad|vantage, but no longer; and &s;o long may the government continue to i&s;&s;ue it, without any danger of creating too great a quantity. While in circulation, there can be no apprehen&s;ion of its depreciation, having <HI>indubitable</HI> and &s;ufficient funds for its redemption.</P>
<P>Loan-office bills of credit anticipate, from time to time, the improvement of real e&s;tates. Money of this kind ope|rates as a <HI>&s;timulus</HI> to the borrower, to procure funds for re|payment, whereby a &s;pirit of indu&s;try is excited. Add to this, that a circulating medium is e&s;tabli&s;hed, adequate to the nece&s;&s;ities of the whole community; our exports in|crea&s;ed; dome&s;tic trade enlivened; population promoted; and a revenue furni&s;hed to the &s;tate.&mdash;"I will venture to &s;ay" (in the words of Mr. Pownall, extracted from his "Admini&s;tration of the Colonies") "that there never was a wi&s;er or a better mea&s;ure, never one better calculat|ed to &s;erve the u&s;es of an increa&s;ing country, that there never was a mea&s;ure more &s;teadily pur&s;ued, or more faith|fully executed, for forty years together, than the loan-of|fice in Penn&s;ylvania, formed and admini&s;tered by the a&s;|&s;embly of that province."</P>
<P>A<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following extracts from that invaluable work, Sir James Stew|art's Political Oeconomy, &s;erve to elucidate further what has been ob|&s;erved, relative to <HI>banks</HI> and <HI>paper money.</HI>&mdash;The great utility and expe|diency of &s;ome in&s;titution for furni&s;hing men with <HI>credit</HI> upon the de|po&s;it of <HI>private &s;ecurity,</HI> are enforced every where by this author, in his ob&s;ervations on <HI>banks of circulation upon mortgage.</HI> The <HI>principles</HI> of this kind of bank may be much more u&s;efully applied, and with greater practicability, in a <HI>new and improving country circum&s;tanced like this,</HI> than in any other.&mdash;I have ob&s;erved the <HI>great affinity</HI> there is between <HI>the&s;e principles and tho&s;e of a loan-office.</HI> The reader will &s;ee this affinity, and will di&s;cern, that the <HI>inferences</HI> deduced from the former will &s;uit the latter: he will make his own comments on the quotations here pre&s;ented to him, which I &s;ubmit to his own judg|ment.</P>
<P>"Banks of circulation upon <HI>private</HI> credit (&s;uch are banks of mort|gage) are of great u&s;e in the <HI>infancy of indu&s;try.</HI> In countries where indu&s;try is only taking root, the greate&s;t ob&s;truction it meets with is the <HI>&s;carcity of money.</HI> When money is &s;carce, payments are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> made, and when the u&s;es of money increa&s;e, if it be not made to augment its proportion, alienation will cea&s;e to go on, and payments will daily be more precarious.&mdash;Now as every individual in a &s;tate does, more or le&s;s, &s;upport indu&s;try by con&s;uming its produce, money mu&s;t be provided for every one, <HI>in proportion to the value of his property.</HI> This opens at once the principle of banks upon <HI>private credit.</HI>"</P>
<P>"A circulating value (money) mu&s;t con&s;tantly bear a proportion to allenation. Circum&s;tances will determine what proportion of coin and what proportion of paper will be nece&s;&s;ary for carrying it on. The&s;e circum&s;tances, under banks of circulation upon <HI>mortgage,</HI> multiply paper &s;o much, that <HI>little coin</HI> is required."</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved in a preceding note, that the bank of England, in 1706, di&s;counted and circulated exchequer bills and tallies. By this &s;ervice, the bank re&s;tored the credit of that <HI>government-paper;</HI> although it had been depreciated, <HI>for want of being punctually paid,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> 30 and 40 per cent. below par. "This operation," &s;ays &s;ir James Stewart, "was quite &s;imilar to banks of circulation upon mortgage; the bank of England was here employed in converting into money exchequer bills, <HI>&s;ecured upon the faith of government. Banks upon mortgage covert into money the property of individuals, upon private &s;ecurity.</HI> Had therefore, banks upon mortgage been e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, at this time, all tho&s;e who had <HI>property</HI> would have got <HI>credit</HI> from them, and would have been enabled thereby to pay their taxes, and carry on their indu&s;try, without dimini&s;hing their con|&s;umption. The exchequer would then have had no occa&s;ion to i&s;&s;ue di&s;credited bills and tallies for making up deficiencies; becau&s;e taxes would have been productive, and the &s;tate would have been relieved of the exce&s;&s;ive burthen of intere&s;t at &s;ix per cent. accumulated quarterly in favour of the bank."</P></NOTE> LOAN-OFFICE, then, is the proper <HI>&s;uccedaneum</HI> to &s;upply the place of a <HI>bank</HI> in this country.</P>
