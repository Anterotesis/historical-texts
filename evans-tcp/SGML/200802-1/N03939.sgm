<HEAD>A LETTER TO THE REVEREND <HI>Mr.</HI> John We&s;ley, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>REVEREND SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have perus'd your Sermon publi&s;h'd under the plau&s;ible Title of <HI>Free Grace.</HI> If an Enemy to the Power of Godline&s;s, had de|clared him&s;elf again&s;t <HI>the Election of Grace,</HI> by as plain Indications of implacable Hatred, as you have done in this printed Sermon, I &s;hould not have been &s;urpriz'd at it; when I remember, what Oppo&s;ition that and other Doctrines founded upon it, have met with, from the <HI>Pelagians</HI> of old, <HI>Papi&s;ts, Socinians,</HI> and the Self-Righteous <HI>Arminians</HI> of late: But to hear the Whi&s;pers of the Enemy, reviving from the Mouth, and Pen, of the Reverend and learned Mr. <HI>We&s;ley,</HI> gives me Room to appre|hend, That there is none, in Time, can plead Ex|emption from &s;inning.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004857_0003_100E03296E8224A8">I am per&s;uaded, That it was neither Enmity, or any other known or wicked Motive, gave Ri&s;e to this Di&s;cour&s;e again&s;t <HI>Election,</HI> but a certain ill-grounded Per&s;ua&s;ion, That what you have delive|red, is <HI>the Truth as it is in Je&s;us,</HI> and therefore found your&s;elf obliged to declare it to the World.</P>
<P>However <HI>(humanum e&s;t errare)</HI> I'm far from ad|vi&s;ing you to venture your <HI>eternal All</HI> upon this Bottom. You'll therefore pardon me, when I &s;ay that I'm convinced, not only, That what you have delivered is <HI>not the Truth as it is in Je&s;us,</HI> but al&s;o find my&s;elf obliged to declare &s;o much to you.</P>
<P>And tho' in Ju&s;tice to the well <HI>ordered</HI> and <HI>ever|la&s;ting Covenant,</HI> I cannot be of your mind, in the Point of <HI>univer&s;al Redemption</HI>; yet let us agree to <HI>put on Bowels of Mercy, Gentlene&s;s and Long-&s;uffer|ing,</HI> in Meekne&s;s <HI>inquiring the Way to Zion: That when the Day breaks, and the Shadows fly away,</HI> it may be reported in <HI>Emanuel's</HI> Land,
<Q><HI>See how the di&s;puting Children are come home, and lovingly warm their Souls under the Redeemer's Wings.</HI></Q></P>
<P>You have been at &s;ome Pains, <HI>Section</HI> 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, to put the <HI>Calvini&s;tical</HI> Notion of <HI>Elec|tion</HI> in a clear Light. You might have &s;aid all in le&s;s Bounds, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>They hold, an eternal, ab&s;olute, per&s;onal <HI>Electi|on,</HI> of a certain Number of <HI>Adam's</HI> Seed to Salvati|on, without an antecedent Re&s;pect to any Qualifi|cation in them, and they leave you to conjecture, how God &s;hall deal with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>You al&s;o hold an Election, which (if I mi&s;take not) is this, &sect; 28.
<Q>An eternal unchangeable
<PB N="5" REF="004857_0003_100E03296E8224A8">
Decree to &s;ave all Men <HI>in the general, re&s;pecting this Qualification</HI> or <HI>Condition,</HI> If they &s;hould &s;uf|fer Chri&s;t to make them alive; That God fore|&s;eeing who would and would not &s;uffer Chri&s;t to make them alive, did eternally and unchange|ably elect tho&s;e who would:</Q>
And you leave them to conjecture, how God &s;hall deal with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I find, upon Examination, That the Difference between the two Schemes, as to the Con&s;equences, is not worth the half of your Sermon. Yes; you'll &s;ay,
<Q>The Doctrine of ab&s;olute <HI>Election</HI> is attended with &s;even Con&s;equences horrible in their Na|ture, hurtful in their Tendency, uncomfortable to Man, and bla&s;phemous towards God, and my Election upon Fore-Knowledge is not.</Q>
If tho&s;e forced Inconveniencies have determined you again&s;t ab&s;olute <HI>Election,</HI> I hope if they &s;hould attend your own, you'll abandon that too. Let us &s;ee:</P>
<P>You'll admit there is a certain Di&s;po&s;ition in one Man to embrace Chri&s;t, that is not in another, who rejects him; for if there is no &s;uch Di&s;po&s;ition, then, if ever God finds out any, it mu&s;t be in an ab&s;olute Way, which you will not allow. &sect;. 3. Therefore in your own Account, they are only the Elect, who,
<Q>according to the Fore-knowledge of God, would &s;uffer Chri&s;t to make them alive;</Q>
<HI>i. e.</HI> whom he did fore&s;ee were di&s;po&s;ed to believe. You'll admit, That the omni&s;cient God did, from Eternity, Foreknow the Number and Names of
<PB N="6" REF="004857_0004_100E032B640F0888">
the Per&s;ons &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, or (if you plea&s;e) whom he was to di&s;po&s;e.</P>
<P>You'll grant al&s;o, That this Fore-knowledge of God is <HI>eternal, unchangeable</HI> and <HI>infallible,</HI> to exclude all Po&s;&s;ibility of Mi&s;take; and by Con&s;e|quence the State of tho&s;e elected upon it, mu&s;t be <HI>eternal, unchangeable,</HI> and <HI>infallible</HI> al&s;o: And if &s;o, then follows your fir&s;t Con&s;equence. &sect;. 9. Vain
<Q>is our Preaching, and vain the People's Hearing, for whether with, or without the&s;e, God <HI>in|fallibly knows whom he did fore&s;ee</HI> in Heaven, and whom in Hell; the&s;e &s;hall unavoidably be &s;aved, and tho&s;e unavoidably damned.</Q>
For it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, any thing &s;hould be otherwi&s;e than as God did fore&s;ee it; for In&s;tance, if of Forty Per&s;ons, God did <HI>eternally,</HI> and <HI>unchangeably</HI> fore&s;ee Twenty di&s;po&s;ed, and Twenty indi&s;po&s;ed, to
"&s;uffer Chri&s;t to make-them alive,"
he as <HI>eternally</HI> and <HI>unchangeably</HI> elected the&s;e, and over-looked tho&s;e; upon which, the State of both is <HI>eternally</HI> fixt; no one &s;ingle Circum&s;tance in the State of either can be otherwi&s;e, than as <HI>unchangeably</HI> Fore&s;een.</P>
<P>If &s;o, your &s;econd Con&s;equence follows, &sect;. 10.
<Q>This tends to de&s;troy Holine&s;s, by wholly taking away the fir&s;t Motives to follow after it, <HI>viz.</HI> The Hope of Heaven and the Fear of Hell. The&s;e can be no Motives to him to &s;truggle for Life, who believes</Q>
<HI>God did fore&s;ee him in Heaven, or Hell</HI>;
"his Lot is ca&s;t already,"
<HI>upon the Foundation of God's Fore-knowledge, who knoweth who are his:</HI>
<Q>And tho' he knows not
<PB N="7" REF="004857_0004_100E032B640F0888">
whether it is Heaven, or Hell, this helps not the Matter; for <HI>(if you judge rightly)</HI> if he knows he &s;hall infallibly be in the one or in the other, it is not rea&s;onable for him to be holy, or practi&s;e any particular Branch of Holine&s;s; &s;uch as, Meekne&s;s or Love. &sect;. 11. Yea, if he believes, <HI>(according to you)</HI> &s;u&s;pects or fears any &s;uch thing, what Comfort can he have from all the precious Promi&s;es of God,</Q>
Which is your third Con&s;equence, &sect;. 12.</P>
<P>Again: If the Foundation of God's Fore-know|ledge &s;tands &s;ure;
<Q>This de&s;troys <HI>our</HI> Zeal for Good Works, for whether with, or without them, &s;hall unavoidably be in Heaven or Hell; and if <HI>we happen</HI> to know that the mo&s;t Part of Mankind &s;hall be damned, this le&s;&s;ens our Love to them, <HI>we</HI> believe it is the Will of God they &s;hould die. Yea; tho' we &s;hould not know whether they &s;hall be in Heaven or Hell, only believe they &s;hall <HI>land</HI> in the one or in the other, our Labour is vain, &amp;c.</Q>
Which is your fourth Con&s;equence, &sect;. 17.</P>
<P>Al&s;o,
<Q>By this Doctrine <HI>of a Fore-known Elec|tion,</HI> the whole Chri&s;tian Revelation is de&s;troy|ed, it is not nece&s;&s;ary,</Q>
<HI>for known to God are all his Works.</HI> The limited Number of Per&s;ons whom from Eternity he did fore&s;ee in Heaven, &s;hall infal|libly be there, and no other &s;hall, whether Revela|tion or none, which is your fifth Con&s;equence. &sect;. 18. All I fore&s;ee you can an&s;wer is, <HI>as God did infallibly fore&s;ee &s;ome in Heaven, &s;o he did as infallibly fore&s;ee the Death of Chri&s;t, the Chri&s;tian Revelation,
<PB N="8" REF="004857_0005_100E032ED74B0B10">
preaching, hearing and Good Works, as the Means towards their being there.</HI> So &s;ay I on ab&s;olute E|lection, as God decreed a certain Number to Salva|tion, &s;o he al&s;o decreed Chri&s;t's Death, the Chri&s;ti|an Revelation, preaching, hearing, and Good Works, as the Means towards that End; And where is the Difference?</P>
<P>Again, This Doctrine of Fore-knowledge
<Q>makes the Chri&s;tian Revelation contradict it&s;elf;</Q>
for In&s;tance, The A&s;&s;ertors of it interpret that Text, <HI>He is not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h,</HI> &amp;c. as im|plying that God made no Man to be damned, quite contrary to that Text, <HI>Prov.</HI> xvi. 4. <HI>The Lord made</HI> All <HI>for him&s;elf, yea, even the Wicked for the Day of Evil</HI>; which is your &s;ixth Con&s;equence.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI>
<Q>This <HI>Doctrine</HI> contains in it manife&s;t Bla&s;phemies.</Q>
&sect;. 23, 24, 25; For in&s;tance, The Lord Je&s;us, the omni&s;cient God invited every individual Sinner to him, and wept <HI>becau&s;e of the Hardne&s;s of Men's Hearts,</HI> tho' he did fore&s;ee &s;ome of them in Hell, as infallibly as his Knowledge was clear and uninterrupted from Eternity, and yet (with Reverence to the <HI>Eternal,</HI> I repeat your Words)
<Q>like a Hypocrite, a Deceiver, a Man void of common Sincerity, invites to Favour whom he knew would never come.</Q>
You &s;ee that the Con&s;equences with which you have load|ed Ab&s;olute Election, &s;o as naturally attend your <HI>Election</HI> upon Fore-knowledge, which has made &s;ome con&s;i&s;tent Gentlemen of your Way, &s;ay, That God &s;u&s;pends his Knowledge in &s;uch a Ca&s;e <HI>i. e.</HI> de&s;troys his own being; and, That God cannot
<PB N="9" REF="004857_0005_100E032ED74B0B10">
know Contingencies, <HI>i. e.</HI> what depends upon the Will of another. Some Men chu&s;e rather to bid an open Defiance to Heaven than hold Prede&s;tination! I hope God will not allow you to be hurried their Length. But perhaps you'll &s;ay, That God's Fore-knowledge has no cau&s;al <HI>Influence</HI> towards the Exi|&s;tence, or Non-exi&s;tence of any thing. I an&s;wer, ju&s;t as much as his po&s;itive Decree; for In&s;tance, God did Decree from Eternity I &s;hould write to Day; he did eternally and infallibly fore&s;ee that you would read to Day; it is therefore as eternally impo&s;&s;ible for you not to read, as it is for me not to write; or it was as certain from Eternity, That you &s;hould read and I write, as it is when we have done both: And yet it is certain, you find your|&s;elf free to read or not read, and I my&s;elf to write or not write. So that hitherto your Doctrine of Fore-knowledge, is as narrow, ungenerous and ill-natured, as ab&s;olute Election. Let us &s;ee whether your next Account of it is more generous.</P>
<P>You tell us (&sect;. 3.)
<Q>The Grace or Love of God is free in all to whom it is given.</Q>
You mu&s;t mean <HI>Paul</HI>'s Love to God, or God's Love to <HI>Paul. Paul</HI>'s Love to God, is not free: Chri&s;t bought it, the Spirit wrought it and &s;upports it. Therefore you mu&s;t mean God's Love to <HI>Paul</HI> is free. What did con&s;titute <HI>Paul</HI>'s <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to that Love? <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s <HI>Death</HI>: That has founded a Title to every Individual of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Seed, as well as to <HI>Paul</HI>; there mu&s;t therefore be &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hing Love to <HI>Paul,</HI> to make him differ from <HI>Simon,</HI> call it a Second Love, or a more inten&s;e Degree of the &s;ame Love, or without Degrees, the &s;ame Love ap|plied
<PB N="10" REF="004857_0006_100E03307842B5C0">
or what el&s;e you plea&s;e; it is plain, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> would be a Cypher in <HI>Paul</HI>'s Salvation, without the <HI>la&s;t.</HI> I a&s;k, What did con&s;titute his Title to that Second Love? You an&s;wer, &sect;. 3.
<Q>Not any thing he is, or has done, not his good Purpo&s;es, Endeavours, good De&s;ires, or Intentions, the&s;e flow from the Grace, or Love of God, not it from them.</Q>
Never <HI>Prede&s;tinarian</HI> made Grace more ab&s;olute! It is then, in all po&s;&s;ible Re&s;pects <HI>free,</HI> which others call <HI>ab&s;olutely free</HI>; and &s;ince it depends on nothing in, or about <HI>Paul,</HI> it (mu&s;t if we &s;peak Sen&s;e) be irre&s;i&s;table too. Thus you have got into <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> and <HI>irre&s;i&s;table Grace.</HI> You'll go further, and own, That God purpo&s;ed Ye&s;ter|day, to give that Grace to <HI>Paul</HI> to Day, and what he purpo&s;ed Ye&s;terday, he purpo&s;ed from <HI>Eternity</HI>; for there are no new Acts in the Will of God, but
<Q>through one Eternal Now, the &s;ame;</Q>
So that God's Love to <HI>Paul</HI> is <HI>ab&s;olute, irre&s;i&s;table</HI> and <HI>eternal.</HI> You'll al&s;o grant, That God from Eter|nity, could di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>Paul</HI> by Name and Per&s;on, from <HI>Simon</HI>: That as purpo&s;ely, freely, knowingly, and eternally, God dealt with <HI>Paul</HI>; &s;o with every <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> who &s;hall be in Glory: And I am &s;ure you will not deny, that God from Eternity did know their exact Number, Names, and Per&s;ons. And as to the Decree of God, it is his <HI>eternal, con|tinued Thought</HI> or <HI>Purpo&s;e,</HI> (u&s;e which Term you will) knowing, fore-knowing, &s;eeing, di&s;cerning them, without the lea&s;t De&s;ire, Intention or En|deavour on their Side, (as you have granted) to bribe his eternal Re&s;pect. So that by what you have ad|mitted, you are as ab&s;olute a <HI>Prede&s;tinarian</HI> as any in Town.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="004857_0006_100E03307842B5C0">However, let that be as it will, you'll overturn all immediately: Grace mu&s;t depend, in its coming and going, on &s;ome Power in Man, tho' at the Expence of God's Fore-knowledge, Power, and Wi&s;dom; yea, to the utter Confu&s;ion of all God's Ways, and Works; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, you are not Singular in this Conduct; for enquire of the Coun&s;el of <HI>Trent,</HI> of all <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> (<HI>excepting a few</HI> Jan|&s;eni&s;ts) of the Church of <HI>England</HI> (<HI>excepting the Ar|ticles, and a few &s;erious Mini&s;ters, who are</HI> rarae aves in terris) and of all other <HI>Univer&s;ali&s;ts,</HI> whether Grace is free? You &s;hall be an&s;wered; It is Free; and &s;ometimes front their Performances with <HI>Free Grace</HI>; when their plain Meaning is free in the general, free to all, and free to none, unle&s;s they bribe it with a good Di&s;po&s;ition, and a few good Works to help it up, free, as it is God's, and bought as it is ours; fir&s;t by Chri&s;t for every Body, and next by every Body for him&s;elf: Or free at a Di|&s;tance, which will never come unto you, unle&s;s you go to it; and tho' it &s;hould happen to come, you may re&s;i&s;t it: Or free for the taking, <HI>i.e.</HI> if you get Faith, God will get Grace; or if you get a Pur|po&s;e, a Di&s;po&s;ition, God will find Faith, and more Grace after that: Free in the Purcha&s;e, brib'd in the Application: Free in the Offer, clogg'd in the Enjoyment: Free in the Front, mercenary in the Body: Free in Sound, and bound in Fact. Now, Sir, if this was your Meaning, why was you di&s;inge|nuous, to write the fir&s;t Part of your Sermon? And if not, why was you injurious, to write the la&s;t? For I defy an Angel to reconcile both together, with the Provi&s;o he &s;peak Sen&s;e: However, you'll attempt it.</P>

"Grace is free for All;"
What All? <HI>Every Child of the fir&s;t Adam, Chri&s;t ta&s;ted Death for All, and procured the Love of God in the general?</HI> How then comes the Difference to be made? <HI>by God's Fore-knowledge of Something in the one, which is not in the other.</HI> What can that be? <HI>A Power to choo&s;e, or to refu&s;e.</HI> Every Man has that Power (you &s;ay) in virtue of Chri&s;t's Death, they are yet on a Level: What more? <HI>Faith in the one, and not in the other.</HI> What Faith? either the general Faith of Chri&s;t's coming to the World to &s;ave Sin|ners, which Devils have as well as Men; or that which purifies the Heart, and di&s;tingui&s;hes from Men and Devils? You'll &s;ay <HI>the la&s;t</HI>; tho' the Generality of your Way are wi&s;e, tho' irreligious, to hold by <HI>the fir&s;t.</HI> How does he fore&s;ee this Faith in them; as his own, or as theirs, or as his and theirs together? <HI>Not entirely as his, for as &s;uch, he is willing every Man &s;hould have it; not entirely as theirs, it is the Gift of God: It mu&s;t be his by Giving, and theirs by Acceptance and Enjoyment.</HI> How come they to ac|cept of it, and not others; It mu&s;t be either by a peculiar Turn in their Con&s;titution, or by a certain Act of their Will? It cannot be by the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that would argue Partiality in the Maker, or &s;omething wor&s;e, which you will not allow; it mu&s;t then be by an Act of their Will, a Turn, a De&s;ire, a Purpo&s;e, call it what you will: It is very plain, that all the awful and my&s;terious Proceedings of God, in relati|on to Man's Salvation entirely depend for Succe&s;s, on a &s;ingle contingent Turn in the Will of Man.

You believe:</P>
<P N="1">1. That no created Motive can influence an un|created Mind, to act or not act otherwi&s;e than he eternally thought fit to be done. Therefore it fol|lows, that no created Di&s;po&s;ition, &amp;c. can influence God to &s;ave any, but whom he purpo&s;ed from <HI>Eter|nity</HI> to &s;ave.</P>
<P N="2">2. That there are no fre&s;h Purpo&s;es in the Mind of God, as in that of Man, <HI>He is not Man that he &s;hould repent,</HI> and proceed upon Rea&s;ons to Day, unknown to him Ye&s;terday. His Purpo&s;es, and the Rea&s;ons on which he proceeds, are as Eternal as Him&s;elf. Therefore it follows, That if God pur|po&s;es to &s;ave <HI>John</HI> to Day, or Twenty Years hence he purpo&s;ed the &s;ame from Eternity, and that upon eternal Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="3">3. That there is no formal, oral, judicial <HI>Decree</HI> with God, as with Men. The uncreated con&s;tant Purpo&s;e of his Mind, is his <HI>Decree,</HI> call it Thought, Purpo&s;e or Decree, it matters not. Therefore it follows, That God did eternally and unchangeably
<PB N="18" REF="004857_0010_100E03396EE101D0">
<HI>decree</HI> to &s;ave <HI>John.</HI> And if the Affirmative holds the Negative mu&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> If God did not purpo&s;e to &s;ave <HI>Judas,</HI> when he hanged him&s;elf, neither did he (God) from Eternity.</P>
<P N="4">4. That if God purpo&s;ed, to Day, to &s;ave <HI>John,</HI> through Chri&s;t, preaching, hearing, &amp;c, He purpo|&s;ed the &s;ame Salvation to <HI>John,</HI> by the &s;ame Means from Eternity, &amp;c. Therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">5. That if God knows <HI>John</HI>'s Per&s;on and Name to Day, he knew that numerical Per&s;on and Name from Eternity; and as truly knows the Names and Per&s;ons of every Heir of Glory. Therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now, if you deny the above Propo&s;itions, or any of them, you lo&s;e your God, and have a Man in his Room: And if you own them, you lo&s;e univer&s;al <HI>Redemption,</HI> and find in its Room, an eternal, un|changeable Purpo&s;e, or <HI>Decree</HI> to &s;ave thro' Chri&s;t, &amp;c. a certain Number of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Seed per&s;onally, nominally, freely, and ab&s;olutely, without Re&s;pect to any Qualification in them, more than in others.</P>
<P>After all, tho' you cannot deny the Propo&s;itions you'll deny the Conclu&s;ion no doubt, <HI>viz.</HI> Ab&s;olute Election; becau&s;e of the Seven Con&s;equences, you have drawn from it, which induce you to believe,
"it is not of God."
I have made the very &s;ame Con&s;equences attend your Doctrine of Fore-know|ledge. Why then &s;hould you believe any of them to be of God, but pur&s;ue a Third Scheme?

<Q>This Doctrine tends to de&s;troy the Comforts of Religion.</Q>
This is turning the Chace! We think the Doctrine teaching a Man, tho' a real Child of God to Day, may open his Eyes in Hell To-morrow, to be the mo&s;t uncomfortable of the Two. However, you &s;ay,
<Q>this is evident, as to tho&s;e who believe them|&s;elves to be reprobated.</Q>

<Q>It is true of tho&s;e who only &s;u&s;pect or fear it.</Q>
I am &s;ure not true, for I &s;u&s;pect and fear it, and en|joy many Rays of Comfort. <HI>No Comfort when you fear.</HI> Yes, if you believe me, &s;ometimes my Trembling and Mirth join &s;o clo&s;e, that I cannot di&s;tingui&s;h the one or the other.</P>
<P>&sect;. 13, 14, 15. You give Life to this Objection by ob&s;erving,
<Q>The A&s;&s;erters of <HI>Election</HI> have their Doubts and Fears; whereas many of tho&s;e who hold it not, have a full A&s;&s;urance of Faith to exclude all Doubts and Fears.</Q>
This is a new Turn! <HI>Univer&s;ali&s;ts</HI> hitherto have tho't others half mad, to affirm A&s;&s;urance of Salvation, to be attain|able in Time. <HI>Univer&s;ali&s;ts</HI> now do affirm, the op|po&s;ite
<Q>Doctrine not to be of God, becau&s;e it tends to ob&s;truct, if not de&s;troy that A&s;&s;urance.</Q>
How comes this about? The <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> after <HI>Ab&s;o|lution,</HI> or any other Sacrament, are a&s;&s;ured they have Grace,
<Q>a feeling Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of God's Love in their Hearts, and the Willingne&s;s of the Spirit.</Q>
The Engli&s;h <HI>Arminians</HI> deny not the A&s;&s;urance of Grace, <HI>i. e.</HI> That they are Chil|dren of God now, tho' po&s;&s;ibly of <HI>Satan</HI> To-morrow. The <HI>Quakers</HI> are as &s;trongly per&s;uaded of a
<Q>feeling Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of God in their Hearts.</Q>
You plead for A&s;&s;urance with the re&s;t; Do you mean any Thing more than they? No:
<Q>This Feeling Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of God in the Heart, or the witne&s;|&s;ing of the Spirit, &amp;c. implies a full A&s;&s;urance, that pa&s;t Sins are forgiven, but not a full A&s;&s;u|rance of our future Per&s;everance.</Q>
The Coun|cil of <HI>Trent,</HI> and the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Writers have told us this
<PB N="23" REF="004857_0012_100E033DCA209338">
much, a Thou&s;and Times over. And as you are convinced many of them take fond Pre&s;umption for A&s;&s;urance; even of Grace; &s;o it cannot at all en|danger your after Salvation, to lo&s;e your Comfort for a Time, in examining whether your A&s;&s;urance be of the &s;ame Nature with theirs. Better to work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling, than to enjoy a temporary one, without either.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, the Salvation you contend for, is not worth much Fear and Doubts; for when you have got it, you are only a&s;&s;ured you have a crea|ted Love or Joy, are Creature for your Portion. Are you certain you &s;hall have the Creator? No:
"I take no Thought for To-morrow."
Chri&s;t in|tended by the&s;e Words, We &s;hould take no Tho't for the Creature. You intend, we &s;hould take no Tho't for the Creator.
<Q>We feel the Creator po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing our Hearts, &amp; his Spirit witne&s;&s;ing with us.</Q>
You really can never feel God in or about you. You feel only &s;ome created Effects of an invi&s;ible unfelt Hand, &s;uch as Love and Joy, &amp;c. And tho' you are a&s;&s;urred of the&s;e Effects, (be&s;ides the Danger of their ari&s;ing from other Cau&s;es) you are a&s;&s;ured of nothing material, in Time or Eternity; and yet you fear none. No:
<Q>Becau&s;e the Holy Gho&s;t &s;upports &s;uch A&s;&s;urance, and needs not a &s;peculative Faith to help it.</Q>
Suppo&s;ing he did &s;upport it, (which notwith&s;tanding may be a De|lu&s;ion.) Yet Holy Gho&s;t, Love, A&s;&s;urance, and all may turn away To-morrow, and leave you in Hell; and yet you fear none. No: Becau&s;e,
<Q>If I abide in Him, he &s;hall abide with me from Hour to Hour.</Q>
I am not to believe, if his eternall. we

he not engaged to keep you in Him, your created Love cannot keep him in you. It is not un&s;afe therefore, to doubt a little of your Strength to keep Him; for according to your own Account, one &s;inful Thought, tho' on a Death-Bed, is enough to lo&s;e Chri&s;t's Spirit, Grace and Glory: and yet you fear none. No:
<Q>Becau&s;e I have the full A&s;&s;urance of Faith, &amp;c.</Q>
If you believe the Apo&s;tle, Faith is the Sub&s;tance of Things not &s;een and the Evidence of Things hoped for. Things not &s;een, not felt, not at hand, not in your Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Whatever A&s;&s;urance you have, cannot be that of Faith, but of Sen&s;e; therefore not the chief Com|fort of the Believer; (tho' you &s;ay it is) becau&s;e every created Grace in you is vitiated, by re|maining Corruption, and the lea&s;t Imperfection in any of them, is enough to exclude the Soul from God forever; and yet you fear none.</P>
<P>Real A&s;&s;urance of Faith, is a full Per&s;ua&s;ion in the Soul, that neither Life, or Death, Things pre|&s;ent or to come, &s;hall &s;eparate him from the uncre|ated Love of God, in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This A&s;&s;u|rance, you &s;ay,
<Q>is not nece&s;&s;arily implied in your full A&s;&s;urance;</Q>
therefore, &s;ay I, your A&s;&s;u|rance is not good: Much like his who &s;aid, <HI>If the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin &s;tands at my Bed-Side, I'm &s;ure to be &s;aved; if not, I'm &s;ure to be damned.</HI> But the full A&s;&s;urance of the Imputation of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, apprehended by Faith alone, is that, which others labour for with Doubts and Fear. And you
<Q>appeal to them, to &s;ay it between God and them, whether their Fears have not returned?</Q>
You &s;hould rather have put the Que&s;tion, Whether their
<PB N="25" REF="004857_0013_100E034002969900">
Fears have ever left them? For generally they can|not pre&s;ume, they are out of the Reach of Danger, till in Chri&s;t's Arms. They cannot be Fearle&s;s in their Enemies Land.</P>
<P>You add on this Head, (&sect;. 16.)
<Q>A Thought uncomfortable to tho&s;e who have put on Bowels of Mercy, &amp;c. That Thou&s;ands and Millions, without any preceding Offence of theirs, are un|changeably doom'd to everla&s;ting Burnings.</Q>
Is not this as uncomfortable a Thought? That God unchangeably fore&s;eeing Thou&s;ands and Millions &s;hould offend, and knowing the very Per&s;ons who would, &s;hould notwith&s;tanding create them meerly to be damned? Does not this follow, as plain on your Doctrine, as that upon the other? But what &s;hall you <HI>gain at the Almighty's Hand, to charge him fooli&s;hly,</HI> and to &s;ay, <HI>Why ha&s;t thou made me thus? His Ways are pa&s;t finding out. He &s;hall give Account of his Matters to none.</HI></P>

<Q>This Doctrine de&s;troys Good Works, by de&s;troying our Love to the Evil and Unthankful, and cutting off one of the &s;tronge&s;t Motives to Acts of Bodily Mercy, &s;uch as Feed|ing the Hungry, and Cloathing the Naked, <HI>viz.</HI> The Hope of Saving their Souls from Death.</Q>
This runs upon an impo&s;&s;ible Suppo&s;ition of know|ing the Evil, <HI>i. e.</HI> Non-Elected.
