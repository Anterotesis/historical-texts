<P>NOTHING can be more applicable to the &s;olemnity in which we are engaged, than this pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred writ. The Prophecy &s;eems to have been made for our&s;elves, it is &s;o exactly de&s;criptive of that important, that compre|hen&s;ive, that e&s;&s;ential civil ble&s;&s;ing, which kindles the lu&s;tre, and diffu&s;es the joy of the pre&s;ent day. Nor is this the only
<PB N="2" REF="016753_0005_0F9E703E996B2808">
pa&s;&s;age of holy Scripture that holds up to our view a &s;triking re&s;emblance between our own circum&s;tances and tho&s;e of the antient I&s;raelites; a nation cho&s;en by God a theatre for the di&s;play of &s;ome of the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;pen&s;ations of his Pro|vidence. Like that nation we ro&s;e from oppre&s;&s;ion, and emerged "from the Hou&s;e of Bondage": Like that nation we were led into a wilderne&s;s, as a refuge from tyranny, and a preparation for the enjoy|ment of our civil and religious rights: Like that nation we have been pur&s;ued through the &s;ea, by the armed hand of power, which, but for the &s;ignal interpo|&s;itions of Heaven, mu&s;t before now have totally defeated the noble purpo&s;e of our emigration: And, to omit many other in&s;tances of &s;imilarity, like that nation we have been ungrateful to the Supreme Ruler of the world, and too "lightly e&s;teemed the Rock of our Salvation"; accordingly, we have been corrected by his ju&s;tice, and at the &s;ame time remarkably &s;upported and defended by his mercy: So that we may di&s;cern our own picture in the figure of the antient church divinely exhibited to Mo&s;es in vi&s;ion, "a bu&s;h burning and not con&s;umed." This day, this memorable day, is a witne&s;s, that the Lord, He who&s;e
<PB N="3" REF="016753_0006_0F9E703F59840F08">
"hand maketh great, and giveth &s;trength unto all, hath not for&s;aken us, nor our God forgotten us." This day, which forms a new aera in our annals, exhibits a te&s;timony to all the world, that contrary to our de&s;erts, and amid&s;t all our troubles, the ble&s;&s;ing promi&s;ed in our text to the afflicted &s;eed of Abraham is come upon us; "Their Nobles &s;hall be of them&s;elves, and their Governor &s;hall proceed from the mid&s;t of them."</P>
<P>This Prophecy has an immediate re&s;pect to the deliverance of the Jews from the cruel oppre&s;&s;ions of the king of Babylon. Their &s;ufferings, when they fell under the power of this haughty tyrant, as they are repre&s;ented to us in &s;acred hi&s;tory, mu&s;t harrow a bo&s;om &s;oftened with the lea&s;t degree of humanity. They give us a fright|ful picture of the effects of de&s;potic power, guided and inflamed by tho&s;e lu&s;ts of the human heart with which it is &s;eldom un|accompanied. Can we forbear weeping for human nature, or blu&s;hing for its de|gradation, when we view either the &s;ufferer or the actor in &s;uch a &s;cene; the relentle&s;s oppre&s;&s;or, or tho&s;e who are "&s;ore broken in the place of dragons?" What can be more pathetic than the de&s;cription of it
<PB N="4" REF="016753_0007_0F9E70401968A380">
given by the &s;ame Prophet who gave the con&s;olation in our text. <Q>How doth the city &s;it &s;olitary that was full of people? How is &s;he become as a widow: &s;he that was great among the nations, and prince&s;s among the provinces? She weepeth &s;ore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; &s;he hath none to comfort her; her friends have dealt treacherou&s;ly with her. Judah is gone into captivity; be|cau&s;e of affliction, and becau&s;e of great &s;ervitude, &s;he findeth no re&s;t. Her mighty men are trodden under foot; her young men are cru&s;hed; the young and the old lie on the ground in the &s;treets&mdash;Mine eyes do fail with tears; my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured on the earth, for the de&s;truction of the daughter of my people.</Q></P>
<P>Such are the fruits of lawle&s;s and de&s;potic power in a mortal man intoxicated with it: Such de&s;olations does it make in the earth &mdash;Such havock in the family of God, merely for the &s;ake of enlarging it's bounds and impre&s;&s;ing its terror on the human bo&s;om. It often, indeed, claims a divine original, and impudently &s;upports it&s;elf not barely on the permi&s;&s;ion, but the expre&s;s de&s;ignation of him "who&s;e tender mercies
<PB N="5" REF="016753_0008_0F9E7040D96E48D0">
are over all his works;" though it exactly re&s;embles the grand adver&s;ary of God and man, and is only a "roaring lion that &s;eeketh whom he may devour." To plead a divine right for &s;uch a power is truly to teach "the doctrine of devils." It covets every thing without bounds: It gra&s;ps every thing without pity: It riots on the &s;poils of innocence and indu&s;try: It is proud to annihilate the rights of mankind; to de|&s;troy the faire&s;t con&s;titutions of wi&s;dom, policy and ju&s;tice, the broade&s;t &s;ources of human happine&s;s: While it en&s;laves the bodies, it deba&s;es the minds of the offspring of God: In its progre&s;s it changes the very face of nature, it withers even the fruits of the earth, and fru&s;trates the bounties of our common parent. "Before it is the garden of God, behind it is a de&s;olate wilderne&s;s."</P>
<P>Looking upon the Jews when groaning under &s;uch a power; their armies van|qui&s;hed; the flower of their country cut off by the &s;word; their fortre&s;&s;es reduced; their cities in a&s;hes; their land ravaged; their temple and wor&s;hip de&s;troyed, and the remnant of the nation led in chains to a foreign land; who would have thought that in a few years, the&s;e cities and this
<PB N="6" REF="016753_0009_0F9E7041995FB658">
temple &s;hould ri&s;e again from their ruins, and a people &s;o totally en&s;laved and widely di&s;per&s;ed be re&s;tored to their rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, their laws and in&s;titutions; peace, liberty and plenty daily augmenting their numbers, and lighting up the face of joy through their whole land; while the haughty empire of Babylon, from which they had &s;uffered &s;o much, &s;hould &s;et to ri&s;e no more! Such, however, were the decrees of Heaven; &s;uch the predictions of the in&s;pired Prophets; and &s;uch the event.</P>
<P><Q>Thus &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will bur&s;t thy bonds, and &s;trangers &s;hall no more &s;erve them&s;elves of thee; but thou &s;halt &s;erve the Lord thy God: and the city &s;hall be builded upon her own heap, and they &s;hall come and &s;ing in the height of Zion: And fields &s;hall be bought in this land whereof ye &s;ay it is de&s;olate, it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans&mdash;men &s;hall buy fields for money. And they that devour thee &s;hall be devoured; and they that &s;poil thee &s;hall be a &s;poil. And out of Judah &s;hall proceed thank&s;giving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them and they &s;hall not be few;
<PB N="7" REF="016753_0010_0F9DF1877338F210">
I will al&s;o glorify them and they &s;hall not be &s;mall. Their children al&s;o &s;hall be as aforetime, and their congregation, their religious and civil a&s;&s;emblies, &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed before me: and I will puni&s;h all that oppre&s;s them: and their Nobles &s;hall be of them&s;elves, and their Gover|nor &s;hall proceed from the mid&s;t of them, and I will cau&s;e him to draw near, and he &s;hall approach unto me.</Q></P>
<P>When Nebuchadnezzar invaded the land of Judea, and brought upon it &s;uch de|va&s;tations and mi&s;eries, it was governed by a King, who &s;hared in the captivity of his &s;ubjects, and was led with them by the conqueror in chains to Babylon. But in the happy re&s;toration promi&s;ed in our text, it is ob&s;ervable, that the royal part of their government was not to be renewed. No mention is made in this refre&s;hing pre|diction of a King, but only of Nobles, men of principal character and influence, who were to <HI>be of them&s;elves,</HI> and &s;uch as they would chu&s;e to conduct their affairs; and a Governor, who &s;hould al&s;o <HI>proceed from the mid&s;t of them,</HI> and pre&s;ide over all, cloathed with a tempered authority and dignity, not with arbitary power, and the means of gratifying an unbounded avarice and ambition.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="016753_0011_0F9DF188409260A8">The form of government originally e&s;tab|li&s;hed in the Hebrew nation by a charter from Heaven, was that of a free republic, over which God him&s;elf, in peculiar favour to that people, was plea&s;ed to pre&s;ide. It con&s;i&s;ted of three parts; a chief magi&s;trate who was called judge or leader, &s;uch as Jo&s;hua and others, a council of &s;eventy cho|&s;en men, and the general a&s;&s;emblies of the people. Of the&s;e the two la&s;t were the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and permanent, and the fir&s;t more occa&s;ional, according to the particular circum&s;tances of the nation. Their Council or Sanhedrim, remained with but little &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion, through all the vici&s;&s;itudes they ex|perienced, till after the commencement of the chri&s;tian aera. And as to the a&s;&s;emblies of the people, that they were frequently held by divine appointment, and con&s;idered as the fountain of civil power, which they exerted by their own decrees, or di&s;tributed into various channels as they judged mo&s;t con|ducive to their own &s;ecurity, order, and happine&s;s, is evident beyond contradiction from the &s;acred hi&s;tory. Even the law of Mo&s;es, though framed by God him&s;elf, was not impo&s;ed upon that people again&s;t their will; it was laid open before the whole congregation of I&s;rael; they freely adopted it, and it became their law, not only by
<PB N="9" REF="016753_0012_0F9DF18A7AEE9028">
divine appointment, but by their own volun|tary and expre&s;s con&s;ent. Upon this account it is called in the &s;acred writings a <HI>Covenant,</HI> compact, or mutual &s;tipulation.</P>
<P>A &s;olemn renewal of this covenant was the very la&s;t public act of Jo&s;hua their re|nowned leader. "He gathered all the tribes of I&s;rael to Sechem, and called for the elders of I&s;rael, and for the heads and for the judg|es, and for their officers, and they pre&s;ented them&s;elves before God." The occa&s;ion was great and important; being nothing le&s;s than to renew their acceptance of the con|&s;titution they had received from Heaven, and &s;olemnly to confirm the national com|pact. How augu&s;t was this a&s;&s;embly of a great nation, it's repre&s;entatives and magi|&s;trates of every order, with their brave and faithful leader at their head; He, who had been foremo&s;t to face the dangers of their cau&s;e, who had fought &s;o many battles for their happy &s;ettlement, and rendered &s;uch various and important &s;ervices to his coun|try. In a &s;hort but nervous and pathetic addre&s;s to the a&s;&s;embly, he reminded them of their &s;mall original; of the peculiar favors granted by Heaven to their proge|nitors; of their remarkable deliverance from the &s;lavery of Egypt; of the wonders wrought for them by a divine hand in their
<PB N="10" REF="016753_0013_0F9DF18B5E68B2D0">
progre&s;s thro' the wilderne&s;s; in their con|que&s;ts on the borders of Canaan, and their firm po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that promi&s;ed land. Deeply impre&s;&s;ed with this intere&s;ting re|collection, he warmly declares his own re&s;o|lution to abide by that noble cau&s;e for which they had been led by Heaven from an ignominious and &s;ervile dependence, and formed into a di&s;tinct and re&s;pectable nation. But as the memorable act of the day depended intirely on the con&s;ent of the people, he accordingly refers the mat|ter to their own free determination. "Chu&s;e you this day whom you will &s;erve." It was impo&s;&s;ible for the people not to be moved by &s;uch an addre&s;s; not to di&s;cern the excellency of the mo&s;aic con&s;titutions; how well they were adapted to the parti|cular circum&s;tances of the nation, and the noble purpo&s;es they were de&s;igned to pro|mote. The people replied, <HI>the Lord our God we will &s;erve</HI>; we con&s;ent, and are determined to be governed by the laws and the &s;tatutes he has been &s;o graciou&s;ly plea|&s;ed to afford us. "Then Jo&s;hua &s;aid unto the people, ye are witne&s;&s;es again&s;t your&s;elves that ye have cho&s;en the Lord to &s;erve him; and they &s;aid, we are witne&s;&s;es." If ever we renounce the con&s;titution and happy &s;ettlement granted to us by Heaven; if ever
<PB N="11" REF="016753_0014_0F9DF18C8F2B0A98">
we break the &s;acred compact; this day, and all the public and voluntary tran&s;actions of it, mu&s;t be a witne&s;s again&s;t us. "Thus Jo&s;hua made a covenant with the people at Sechem", which, we are afterwards told, he recorded in a book, and at the &s;ame time erected a monumental &s;tone upon the &s;pot, as a memorial of the&s;e &s;acred &s;tipula|tions, and as a perpetual te&s;timony, that the Supreme Ruler him&s;elf had not e&s;tabli&s;hed their polity without their own free con|currence, and that the Hebrew nation, late|ly redeemed from tyranny, had now a civil and religious con&s;titution of their own choice, and were governed by laws to which they had given their &s;olemn con&s;ent.</P>
<P>To mention all the pa&s;&s;ages in &s;acred writ which prove that the Hebrew govern|ment, tho' a theocracy, was yet as to the outward part of it, a free republic, and that the &s;overeignty re&s;ided in the people, would be to recite a large part of it's hi&s;|tory. I will therefore only add a &s;ingle in|&s;tance. When the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and the half tribe of Mana&s;&s;ah had erected a &s;eparate altar, tho' it afterwards appeared with no bad intention, all the other tribes were extremely alarmed, and being met in General A&s;&s;embly, determined
<PB N="12" REF="016753_0015_0F9DF18CEBB76800">
to make war on their offending brethren, But previous to the intended a&s;&s;ault they agreed to &s;end an emba&s;&s;y to expo&s;tulate with them on the occa&s;ion. Phinehaz and ten princes, or principal men, were appointed for this purpo&s;e. Here was an act of &s;overeign|ty, and an act of the highe&s;t importance to the intere&s;t of any nation, involving in it nothing le&s;s than the power of making peace or war. It was not done by Jo&s;hua, tho' he was then alive; it was an act of the congregation of I&s;rael: The emba&s;&s;y upon this momentous ma&s;ter was cho&s;en, com|mi&s;&s;ioned, and in&s;tructed by them. "As it was democratically &s;ent, &s;ays a great au|thor, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Algernon Sidney</HI> upon Government.</NOTE> who wrote conclu&s;ively, who fought bravely, and died gloriou&s;ly in the cau&s;e of liberty, it was democratically received: It was not directed to one man, but to all the children of Reuben, Gad and Mana&s;|&s;ah, and the an&s;wer was &s;ent by them all." The report was made to the congregation, who finally determined the grand que&s;tion, and decided for peace.</P>
<P>Such was the civil con&s;titution of the Hebrew nation, till growing weary of the gift of heaven, they demanded a King. After being admoni&s;hed by the Prophet Samuel of the ingratitude and folly of their
<PB N="13" REF="016753_0016_0F9DF18D8BAD6140">
reque&s;t, they were puni&s;hed in the grant of it. Impiety, corruption and di&s;order of every kind afterwards increa&s;ing among them, they grew ripe for the judgments of Heaven in their de&s;olation and captivity. Taught by the&s;e judgments the value of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings they had before de&s;pi&s;ed&punc; and groaning under the hand of tyranny more heavy than that of death&punc; they felt the worth of their former civil and religious privileges, and were prepared to receive with gratitude and joy a re&s;toration not barely to the land flowing with milk and honey, but to the mo&s;t precious advantage they ever enjoyed in that land, their origi|nal con&s;titution of government: They were prepared to welcome with the voice of mirth and thank&s;giving the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of their congregations; nobles cho&s;en from among them&s;elves, and a governor proceed|ing from the mid&s;t of them.</P>
<P>Such a con&s;titution, twice e&s;tabli&s;hed by the hand of Heaven in that nation, &s;o far as it re&s;pects civil and religious liberty in general, ought to be regarded as a &s;olemn recognition from the Supreme Ruler him|&s;elf of the rights of human nature. Ab|&s;tracted from tho&s;e appendages and for|malities which were peculiar to the Jews,
<PB N="14" REF="016753_0017_0F9DF18E2ADD34A0">
and de&s;igned to an&s;wer &s;ome particular pur|po&s;es of divine Providence, it points out in general what kind of government infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s would e&s;tabli&s;h among mankind.</P>
<P>We want not, indeed, a &s;pecial revela|tion from Heaven to teach us that men are born equal and free; that no man has a natural claim of dominion over his neigh|bours, nor one nation any &s;uch claim upon another; and that as government is only the admini&s;tration of the affairs of a num|ber of men combined for their own &s;ecurity and happine&s;s, &s;uch a &s;ociety have a right freely to determine by whom and in what manner their own affairs &s;hall be admini&s;ter|ed. The&s;e are the plain dictates of that rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e with which the common parent of men has informed the human bo&s;om. It is, however, a &s;atisfacti|on to ob&s;erve &s;uch everla&s;ting maxims of equity confirmed, and impre&s;&s;ed upon the con&s;ciences of men, by the in&s;tructions, precepts, and examples given us in the &s;a|cred oracles; one internal mark of their divine original, and that they come from him "who hath made of one blood all nations to dwell upon the face of the earth," who&s;e authority &s;anctifies only tho&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="016753_0018_0F9DF18F05CE8E98">
governments that in&s;tead of oppre&s;&s;ing any part of his family, vindicate the oppre&s;&s;ed, and re&s;train and puni&s;h the oppre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Unhappy the people who are de&s;titute of the ble&s;&s;ing promi&s;ed in our text; who have not the ulterior powers of government within them&s;elves; who depend upon the will of another State, with which they are not incorporated as a vital part, the intere&s;t of which mu&s;t in many re&s;pects be oppo&s;ite to their own; and who at the &s;ame time have no fixed con&s;titutional barrier to re&s;train this reigning power: There is no mean|ne&s;s or mi&s;ery to which &s;uch a people is not liable: There is not a &s;ingle ble&s;&s;ing, tho' perhaps indulged to them for a while, that they can call their own; there is nothing they have not to dread. Whether the go|verning power be it&s;elf free or de&s;potic, it matters not to the poor dependent. Nati|ons who are jealous of their own liberties often &s;port with tho&s;e of others; nay, it has been remarked, that the dependent provinces of free &s;tates have enjoyed le&s;s freedom than tho&s;e belonging to de&s;potic powers. Such was our late di&s;mal &s;ituation, from which Heaven hath redeemed us by a &s;ignal and glorious revolution. We thought, indeed, we had a charter to &s;up|port
<PB N="16" REF="016753_0019_0F9DF18FC2C5F9E8">
our rights; but we found a written charter, a thin barrier again&s;t all-prevailing power, that could con&s;true it to its own purpo&s;e, or re&s;cind it by the &s;word at its own plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Upon our pre&s;ent independence, &s;weet and valuable as the ble&s;&s;ing is, we may read the in&s;cription, <HI>I am found of them that &s;ought me not.</HI> Be it to our prai&s;e or blame, we cannot deny, that when we were not &s;earching for it, it happily found us. It certainly mu&s;t have been not only innocent but laudable and manly, to have de&s;ired it even before we felt the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of it.

Then all eyes are turned upon it; they view it with attention; and the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions it makes are commonly la&s;ting. This circum&s;tance mu&s;t render the conduct of our pre&s;ent rulers peculiarly important, and fall with particular weight upon their minds. We hope from their wi&s;dom and abilities, their untainted in|tegrity and un&s;haken firmne&s;s, this new
<PB N="36" REF="016753_0039_0F9DF1A331FF2608">
formed Commonwealth will ri&s;e with honour and applau&s;e, and attract that re&s;pect, which the number and quality of its inhabitants, the extent of its territory and commerce, and the natural advantages with which it is ble&s;t, cannot fail, under a good govern|ment, to command.</P>
<P>From our pre&s;ent happy e&s;tabli&s;hment we may rea&s;onably hope for a new energy in government; an energy that &s;hall be felt in all parts of the State: We hope that the &s;inews of civil authority through its whole frame will be well braced, and the public intere&s;t in all its extended branches be well attended to; that no officer will be permitted to neglect the duties, or tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds of his de|partment; that peculations, frauds, and even the &s;maller oppre&s;&s;ions in any office, will be watchfully prevented, or exempla|rily puni&s;hed; and that no corruption will be allowed to re&s;t in any part of the political body, no not in the extreme&s;t, which may &s;pread by degrees, and finally reach the very vitals of the community.</P>
<P>Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;ays one of the greate&s;t politicians and wi&s;e&s;t princes that ever lived, "Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation." This
<PB N="37" REF="016753_0040_0F9DF1A3EB674078">
maxim doth not barely re&s;t upon his own but al&s;o on a divine authority; and the truth of it hath been verified by the expe|rience of all ages.</P>
<P>Our civil rulers will remember, that as piety and virtue &s;upport the honour and hap|pine&s;s of every community, they are pecu|liarly requi&s;ite in a free government. Virtue is the &s;pirit of a Republic; for where all power is derived from the people, all de|pends on their good di&s;po&s;ition. If they are impious, factious and &s;elfi&s;h; if they are abandoned to idlene&s;s, di&s;&s;ipation, luxury, and extravagance; if they are lo&s;t to the fear of God, and the love of their country, all is lo&s;t. Having got beyond the re|&s;traints of a divine authority, they will not brook the control of laws enacted by rulers of their own creating. We may therefore rely that the pre&s;ent Government will do all it fairly can, by authority and example, to an&s;wer the end of its in&s;titution, that the members of this Commonwealth may <HI>lead a quiet and peaceable life in all</HI> GODLI|NESS as well as <HI>hone&s;ty,</HI> and our liberty never be ju&s;tly reproached as licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I know there is a diver&s;ity of &s;entiment re&s;pecting the extent of civil power in reli|gious
<PB N="38" REF="016753_0041_0F9DF1A4AF9964F0">
matters. In&s;tead of entering into the di&s;pute, may I be allowed from the warmth of my heart, to recommend, where con|&s;cience is pleaded on both &s;ides, mutual candour and love, and an happy union of all denominations in &s;upport of a govern|ment, which though human, and therefore not ab&s;olutely perfect, is yet certainly found|ed on the broade&s;t ba&s;is of liberty, and af|fords equal protection to all. Warm par|ties upon civil or religious matters, or from per&s;onal con&s;iderations, are greatly injurious to a free State, and particularly &s;o to one newly formed. We have indeed le&s;s of this than might be expected: We &s;hall be happy to have none at all; happy indeed, when every man &s;hall love and &s;erve his country, and have that &s;hare of public in|fluence and re&s;pect, without di&s;tinction of parties, which his virtues and &s;ervices may ju&s;tly demand. This is the true &s;pirit of a Commonwealth, centring all hearts, and all hands in the common intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Neither piety, virtue, or liberty can long flouri&s;h in a community, where the education of youth is neglected. How much do we owe to the care of our venera|ble ance&s;tors upon this important object? Had not they laid &s;uch foundations for
<PB N="39" REF="016753_0042_0F9DF1A569E21390">
training up their children in knowledge and religion, in &s;cience, and arts, &s;hould we have been &s;o re&s;pectable a community as we this day appear? Should we have under&s;tood our rights &s;o clearly? or valued them &s;o highly? or defended them with &s;uch advantage? Or &s;hould we have been prepared to lay that ba&s;is of liberty, that happy con&s;titution, on which we rai&s;e &s;uch large hopes, and from which we derive &s;uch uncommon joy? We may therefore be confident that the &s;chools, and particularly the univer&s;ity, founded and cheri&s;hed by our wi&s;e and pious fathers, will be patronized and nur&s;ed by a government which is &s;o much indebted to them for its honour and efficacy, and the very principles of its exi&s;tence. The pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of tho&s;e in&s;titutions call for the kinde&s;t attention of our rulers; and their clo&s;e connection with every public intere&s;t, civil and religious, &s;trongly en|forces the call.</P>
<P>The &s;ciences and arts, for the encou|ragement of which a new foundation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</NOTE> hath lately been laid in this Commonwealth, de&s;erve the countenance and particular favour of every government. They are not only ornamental but u&s;eful: They not

only poli&s;h, but &s;upport, enrich, and de|fend a community. As they delight in liberty, they are particularly friendly to free States. Barbarians are fierce and un|governable, and having the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ideas of order, and the benefits re&s;ulting from it, they require the hand of a &s;tern ma&s;ter; but a people enlightened and civilized by the &s;ciences and liberal arts, have &s;enti|ments that &s;upport liberty and good laws: They may be guided by a &s;ilken thread; and the mild puni&s;hments proper to a free State are &s;ufficient to guard the public peace.</P>
<P>An e&s;tabli&s;hed honour and fidelity in all public engagements and promi&s;es, form a branch of righteou&s;ne&s;s that is wealth, is power, and &s;ecurity to a State: It pre|vents innumerable perplexities: It creates confidence in the government from &s;ub|jects and from &s;trangers: It facilitates the mo&s;t advantageous connections: It extends credit; and ea&s;ily obtains &s;upplies in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing public emergencies, and when nothing el&s;e can obtain them: While the want of it, whatever benefits &s;ome &s;hort-&s;ighted politicians may have promi&s;ed from delu&s;ive expedients, and deceitful arts, ren|ders a State weak and contemptible; &s;trips

it of its defence; grieves and provoke its friends, and delivers it up to the will of its enemies. Upon what does the power of the Briti&s;h nation chiefly re&s;t at this mo|ment? That power that has been &s;o un|righteou&s;ly employed again&s;t America? Upon the long and nice pre&s;ervation of her faith in all monied matters. With all her inju&s;tice in other in&s;tances, meer policy hath obliged her to maintain a fair character with her creditors. The &s;upport this hath given her in frequent and expen&s;ive wars, by the &s;upplies it has enabled her to rai&s;e upon loan, is a&s;toni&s;hing. By this her government hath availed it&s;elf of the whole immen&s;e capital of the national debt, which has been expended in the public &s;ervice, while the creditors content them|&s;elves with the bare payment of the inter|e&s;t. It may be demon&s;trated that the growing re&s;ources of the&s;e &s;tates, under the conduct of prudence and ju&s;tice, are &s;ufficient to form a fund of credit for pro|&s;ecuting the pre&s;ent war, &s;o ruinous to Britain, much longer than that nation, loaded as &s;he now is, can po&s;&s;ibly &s;upport it.</P>
<P>But need I urge, in a chri&s;tian audience, and before chri&s;tian rulers, the importance of pre&s;erving inviolate the public faith?
<PB N="42" REF="016753_0045_0F9DF1AA05409AC0">
If this is allowed to be important at all times, and to all &s;tates, it mu&s;t be peculiarly &s;o to tho&s;e who&s;e foundations are newly laid, and who are but ju&s;t numbered among the nations of the earth. They have a national character to e&s;tabli&s;h, upon which their very exi&s;tence may depend. Shall we not then rely that the pre&s;ent government will employ every mea&s;ure in their power, to maintain in this commonwealth a clear ju&s;tice, an untainted honour in all public engagements; in all laws re&s;pecting property; in all regulations of taxes; in all our conduct towards our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates, and towards our allies abroad.</P>
<P>The treaty of alliance and friend&s;hip be|tween HIS MOST CHRISTIAN MAJESTY and the&s;e &s;tates, is engraved on every bo&s;om friendly to the rights and independence of America. If fidelity dwells in &s;uch bo&s;oms, it will be con&s;picuous on every occa&s;ion of performing our own part of the&s;e &s;acred &s;tipulations. The intere&s;t is indeed mu|tual, as was openly confe&s;&s;ed: The treaty is therefore natural, and likely to be la&s;ting.

felt and acknowledged in America. I will not affront either the under&s;tanding or the feelings of this re&s;pectable audience, by attempting formally to demon&s;trate that we have received great advantages and &s;upport from this friend&s;hip. It is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould forget the fir&s;t pledge of it, in the &s;quadron &s;ent to our aid under the orders of that vigilant, active and intrepid com|mander the COUNT D'ESTAING; who greatly di&s;concerted the de&s;igns of the ene|my, and did every thing for us that wi&s;dom and valour, in his &s;ituation, could perform. Nor need I call your attention to that im|portant armament lately arrived to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, under leaders of di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities, and the mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed military reputation. France, tho' a monarchy, has been the nur&s;e and protectre&s;s of free re|publics. Switzerland among others can atte&s;t to this: Her free States can atte&s;t; that during an alliance with France of more than three hundred years, their liberties have been con&s;tantly befriended by that nation, and every part of the treaty for their &s;upport punctually performed. This they have acknowledged in a late &s;olemn renewal of the alliance. An happy omen to the&s;e States, who&s;e circum&s;tances are in many re&s;pects &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the united cantons of Switzerland.</P>

They, who thought no toils or vigilance too great to e&s;tabli&s;h and protect the rights of human nature; no riches too large to be exchanged for them; no blood too precious to be &s;hed for their redemption?&mdash;But who are they who &s;eem to approach nearear to us, and in who&s;e countenances we di&s;cern a peculiar mixture of gravity and joy upon this &s;olemnity? Are they not the venerable Fathers of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; who though not perfect while they dwelt in fle&s;h, were yet greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed by an ardent piety, by all the manly virtues, and by an unquenchable love of liberty&mdash;&mdash;They, who to form a retreat for it, cro&s;&s;ed the ocean, through innumerable difficulties, to a &s;avage land: They, who brought with them a broad Charter of Liberty, over which they wept when it was wre&s;ted from them by the hand of power, and an in&s;idious one placed in its room.

what plea&s;ure do they &s;eem to behold their children, like the antient &s;eed of Abraham, this day re&s;tored to their ori|ginal foundations of freedom! their Go|vernor "as at the fir&s;t, and their Coun|cellors as at the beginning"? Do they not call upon us to defend the&s;e founda|tions at every hazard, and to perpetuate <HI>their</HI> honour in the liberty and virtue of the State they planted?</P>
<P>O thou &s;upreme Governor of the world, who&s;e arm hath done great things for us, e&s;tabli&s;h the foundations of this Common|wealth, and evermore defend it with the &s;aving &s;trength of thy right hand! Grant that here the divine con&s;titutions of Je&s;us thy Son may ever be honoured and main|tained! Grant that it may be the re&s;i|dence of all private and patriotic virtues, of all that enlightens and &s;upports, all that &s;weetens and adorns human &s;ociety, till the &s;tates and kingdoms of this world &s;hall be &s;wallowed up in thine own king|dom: In that, which alone is immortal, may we obtain a perfect citizen&s;hip, and enjoy in its completion, "the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God!&mdash;And let all the people &s;ay, AMEN!</P>
