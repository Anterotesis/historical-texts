<OPENER><SALUTE>MY BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AN occa&s;ion &s;o melancholy as the pre&s;ent, viewed in all circum&s;tances, hath rarely, if ever, fallen under our notice. This numerous a&s;|&s;embly, of all orders and characters, will attend with reverence to the coun&s;el that may be brought from the word of God. E&s;pecially is it to be hop|ed, that <HI>he,</HI> who&s;e tragical death is to &s;ucceed this &s;olemnity, may be all attention to the la&s;t &s;ermon he will ever hear. I have ever con&s;idered that I preached to mortal men; but was ne|ver called to preach to one doomed to death by public ju&s;tice, and but a few hours before his launching into eternity.</P>
<P>AN important end of capital puni&s;hment, as it relates to &s;ociety and this world, is pointed out in the words read. This comprehends &s;undry par|ticulars: It is to rid the &s;tate of a pre&s;ent nui|&s;ance&mdash;to prevent the exten&s;ion of the evil&mdash;to re|claim or pre&s;erve tho&s;e who have been, or might be in danger of being, &s;educed by examples of
<PB N="6" REF="022446_0004_0FB889BF1976EFA8">
profligate wickedne&s;s. <HI>So &s;halt thou put the e|vil away from among you. And tho&s;e which re|main &s;hall hear, and fear, and &s;hall henceforth com|mit no more any &s;uch evil among you.</HI> A further end of capital puni&s;hment will be attended to, as it is a natural con&s;equence from the words. This re&s;pects the offender, and a future world. Let us fir&s;t attend to the former.</P>
<P>WHAT is here &s;aid with immediate re&s;pect to <HI>perjury</HI> is applicable to other crimes equally per|nicious in their tendency. The direction is to civil magi&s;trates and judges, to make diligent en|quiry re&s;pecting the evil; and upon proof of it, to put it away by the exci&s;ion of the criminal. It is a duty which the civil guardians of a commu|nity owe to God and their people. They are the mini&s;ters of God, by him appointed "revengers to execute wrath upon &s;uch as do evil." They may "not bear the &s;word in vain." In being "a terror to evil works," they are mini&s;ters of God for good to the community and its virtuous citi|zens.</P>
<P>THE exci&s;ion of a member of &s;ociety can be ju&s;tified only for crimes of <HI>magnitude.</HI> It is put|ting a period, a reproachful and excruciating peri|od, to the probation of a fellow-creature. A ju&s;t and humane government will recur to it only in ca&s;es where the &s;overeign of life has declared his will, or the public &s;afety clearly requires it. "A|mong the variety of actions which men are daily liable to commit, it is a melancholy truth," &s;ays judge Black&s;tone, "that no le&s;s than an hundred and &s;ixty have been declared by act of parliament
<PB N="7" REF="022446_0005_0FB889C06D4EE080">
to be felonies without benefit of clergy; or, in o|ther words, to be worthy of in&s;tant death. So dreadful a li&s;t, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, increa&s;es the number of offences. The injured, through com|pa&s;&s;ion, will often forbear to pro&s;ecute: Juries, through compa&s;&s;ion, will &s;ometimes forget their oaths, and either acquit the guilty, or mitigate the nature of the offence: And judges, through com|pa&s;&s;ion, will re&s;pite one half of the convicts, and recommend them to the royal mercy. Among &s;o many chances of e&s;caping, the needy or hard|ened offender overlooks the multitude that &s;uffer; he boldly engages in &s;ome de&s;perate attempt to relieve his wants, or &s;upply his vices; and, if un|expectedly the hand of ju&s;tice over-takes him, he deems him&s;elf peculiarly unfortunate, in falling at la&s;t a &s;acrifice to tho&s;e laws, which long impunity had taught him to contemn."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Vol. 4. p. 18, 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>SHALL crimes &s;o different in their natures as murder and a trifling theft be &s;ubjected to the &s;ame penalty? Policy, ju&s;tice and humanity alike re|mon&s;trate again&s;t it. "Death is of dreadful things the mo&s;t dreadful. This terror &s;hould be the la&s;t re&s;ort of authority, the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t opera|tive of prohibitory &s;anctions, and placed before the trea&s;ure of life, to guard from inva&s;ion what can|not be re&s;tored." It doth honor to the wi&s;dom as well as lenity of our legi&s;lators, that not more than &s;ix crimes are capital by our law.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lenity of government &s;hould rather be expre&s;&s;ed in <HI>framing</HI> of penal laws, than in &s;u&s;pending or &s;topping the <HI>execution.</HI> Government is weakened by an|nexing to crimes &s;uch penalties as are too &s;evere to be executed. It is a pre&s;ump|tive evidence of the wi&s;dom and lenity of our penal laws, of the ju&s;t &s;en&s;e our le|gi&s;lators have of the rights of the &s;ubject, and the importance of life, that capital puni&s;hments are very rare with us. In&s;titutions, providing for the pre&s;ervation and employment of public criminals of various de&s;cription, have been found &s;alu|tary in many &s;tates.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="022446_0006_0FB889C1EBE07F88">THE execution of a capital &s;entence &s;hould e|ver be accompanied with circum&s;tances of &s;olemn|ity expre&s;&s;ive of public grief, and adapted to make a la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion on all ages, ranks and charac|ters&mdash;particularly on children and youth: Such &s;olemnity will greatly &s;ub&s;erve the &s;ecurity of the &s;tate, and the cau&s;e of morality.</P>
<P>VARIOUS crimes were made capital by the jewi&s;h con&s;titution, for peculiar rea&s;ons which do not apply to other people. Nations are far from being agreed in the number of crimes which &s;hould be puni&s;hed with death. The circum|&s;tances of different nations may require them to have recour&s;e to this puni&s;hment for different crimes. Nations in general have agreed to make murder, trea&s;on, and rape, capital. The divine legi&s;lator has expre&s;&s;ly interpo&s;ed his authority with re&s;pect to the fir&s;t. And the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for the exci&s;ion of a murderer equally applies to all times and people: It is this: <HI>For in the image of God made he man.</HI> The &s;econd, or high trea&s;on, is murder increa&s;ed, and extended to an whole community. The la&s;t is the crime for which this malefactor is to &s;uffer death. It is be&s;ide the intent of this &s;olemnity to &s;pecify all the crimes which the legi&s;lature and magi&s;tracy of a &s;tate may be bound to put away by cutting off the perpetra|tors. Such we &s;uppo&s;e this malefactor's offence to have been. Seldom is <HI>&s;uch</HI> an offence &s;o am|ply proved. For &s;eldom is a delinquent of this de&s;cription &s;o bold and &s;hamele&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is on all hands agreed that a private citizen may defend him&s;elf again&s;t a violent a&s;&s;ault. The
<PB N="9" REF="022446_0007_0FB889C3DC3E06B8">
con&s;equence is plain, that a &s;tate may defend her citizens again&s;t &s;uch a&s;&s;ault. When lenity to a criminal would be cruelty to good &s;ubjects, on what ground doth he expect lenity? The God of order hath ve&s;ted civil government with authority to pre&s;erve it&s;elf&mdash;to provide for the per&s;onal &s;afe|ty and rights of every &s;ubject. He has command|ed the civil magi&s;trate to put away any flagrant evil from the &s;tate. If this can be done only at the expence of life, then life hath been forfeited to the &s;tate. <HI>Ravi&s;hment</HI> is &s;uch an outrage on hu|manity, an injury &s;o great and irreparable, a crime &s;o baneful and dangerous to &s;ociety, that civilized nations have agreed to protect female honor from violence by making death the penalty for this crime.</P>
<P>THERE is a di&s;tinction between the forfeiture of <HI>liberty,</HI> and the forfeiture of <HI>life.</HI> But the cri|minal who&s;e atrocious conduct hath merited im|pri&s;onment for life, doth not differ materially in his moral character from one whom all will allow to have merited death. And whether one who hath wholly forfeited liberty can have a claim to life will admit a que&s;tion. In the in&s;tance before us, we proceed on the &s;uppo&s;ition that it is <HI>un&s;afe</HI> and <HI>dangerous,</HI> and therefore <HI>unfit,</HI> that &s;uch an offender &s;hould live. Tho&s;e who are &s;o depraved in their moral character that they can neither be cured nor endured, are in the civil &s;tate what a mortified member is in the natural body. As &s;uch member mu&s;t be amputated for the pre&s;erva|tion of the body, &s;o per&s;ons of &s;uch depravity mu&s;t be cut off for the pre&s;ervation of the &s;tate. The
<PB N="10" REF="022446_0008_0FB889C4ED7F3780">
ma&s;ter of a family expells from his hou&s;e the member who&s;e re&s;idence in it is no longer con&s;i&s;t|ent with its order and welfare. Should his con|duct as a citizen be equally vicious and dangerous, the like power in civil government mu&s;t be exer|ci&s;ed in &s;entencing him to death&mdash;not to <HI>bani&s;h|ment.</HI> If unworthy to live in his own country, he is equally unworthy to live in another. If he hath no rights in his own country, where hath he any rights? And what indignity to another nati|on, to tran&s;port into it &s;uch convict?</P>
<P>ONE de&s;ign of capital puni&s;hments then is to rid the &s;tate of a pre&s;ent nui&s;ance, and protect good &s;ubjects. A further de&s;ign is to <HI>warn</HI> and <HI>re&s;train</HI> others of evil di&s;po&s;itions. That <HI>tho&s;e which re|main</HI> may <HI>hear and fear.</HI></P>
<P>WITH this view the &s;upreme ruler, in his mo|ral government of the world, &s;ometimes evident|ly &s;ets forth individuals, and &s;ometimes commu|nities, as an <HI>example</HI>&mdash;an example of his righteous &s;everity; and an admonition to the ungodly. You will readily call to mind various examples in &s;crip|ture of the judgments of God, final as to this world&mdash;inflicted with the parental de&s;ign of giv|ing a &s;en&s;ible demon&s;tration of the malignity of vice, preventing the exten&s;ion of it, and awaken|ing a ju&s;t awe in the minds of many, who, were it not for &s;uch admonitions, would proceed to commit all iniquity with greedine&s;s. Divine threatnings as well as judgments recorded in &s;crip|ture are all parental warnings. The divine go|vernment is a pattern to earthly rulers.</P>
<P>SOME may imagine that puni&s;hment, e&s;pecially
<PB N="11" REF="022446_0009_0FB889C66C62CB00">
capital puni&s;hment, mu&s;t be dictated by <HI>revenge.</HI> If only the ca&s;e of the &s;uffering individual came into con&s;ideration, this might appear &s;pecious. But government, from the nature of it, regards a public intere&s;t: It provides for particular parts or members in &s;ubordination and &s;ub&s;erviency to the good of the whole. Surely no individual can complain that his intere&s;t is not con&s;ulted to the injury of any citizen&mdash;much le&s;s at the peril of the public. He cannot complain, that he, being of an abandoned character, is not &s;pared to &s;pread the contagion of iniquity. If righteou&s;ne&s;s exalts a nation, and iniquity is its ruin, goodne&s;s requires that &s;uch as would bring on this ruin be cut off. That mu&s;t be a very bad admini&s;tration under which any &s;ubject is permitted with impunity to a&s;&s;ault his fellow-&s;ubjects, or to &s;educe them from their allegiance. That head of a family doth not con&s;ider what he owes to his hou&s;hold, who &s;uf|fers any member of it to &s;ubvert all order, deco|rum and duty. Nor could we prove the moral rectitude and goodne&s;s of God, were he not known in the cour&s;e of his providence by the judgments he execu&s;eth. Puni&s;hment is his &s;trange work. He delighteth in mercy. But if this doth not re|claim, he will whet his glittering &s;word, and his hand will lay hold on judgment. Benevolence it&s;elf calls for puni&s;hment in this or an after &s;tate, or there is no &s;uch thing as moral government. In civil &s;ociety, the wicked would walk on every &s;ide, and the cry of the oppre&s;&s;ed be in vain, the foundations would be de&s;troyed, confu&s;ion and mi&s;ery would prevail, were puni&s;hment, capital puni&s;hment, never executed.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="022446_0010_0FB889C7EBDA9000">INGENUOUS motives are the be&s;t. But with how many have &s;uch motives little or no influ|ence? It would be well, could we, in inculcating morality, prevail with all by repre&s;enting the rea|&s;onablene&s;s, excellence and advantages of virtue, the turpitude and mi&s;ery of vice. But we are compelled to per&s;uade men by the terror of future judgment, and future wrath. With this view the &s;criptures reveal future indignation and wrath, tribulation and angui&s;h. Yet even the revelation of the wrath of God from heaven doth not re&s;train many. They do not believe, or do not fear, him who can de&s;troy &s;oul and body in hell. So in re|gard to civil government, the <HI>love</HI> of it is the mo&s;t worthy and &s;ure principle of obedience and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion. But what cour&s;e mu&s;t be taken with tho&s;e who neither fear God, nor regard man? who are impatient of controul, and break through the re&s;traints of all laws human and divine? who would di&s;&s;olve &s;ociety, and introduce univer&s;al a|narchy? If &s;uch would be the con&s;equence of &s;uf|fering them to live, they manife&s;tly ought to die, that &s;o great an evil may be prevented. Such ex|amples of public vengeance naturally &s;trike terror into others, who&s;e lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions might impel them to the &s;ame, or as great evil, were it not for this warning.</P>
<P>THERE are but few who are made without fear. So awful and &s;trange a puni&s;hment e&s;pecially, as in a few hours awaits this poor pri&s;oner, is calculated and de&s;igned to put the lawle&s;s in fear. On this occa&s;ion per&s;ons of all characters have come toge|ther. Po&s;&s;ibly there may be &s;ome in this great
<PB N="13" REF="022446_0011_0FB889CAED156990">
concour&s;e, who have been kept back from the &s;ame, or the like exce&s;s of riot, by no other con|&s;ideration than the fear of human laws. To &s;uch e&s;pecially he is now &s;et forth for an example, and will be in a yet more affecting manner in the af|ternoon. Very few have ever been more harden|ed and audacious offenders. Yet even he informs us, that when in the mid&s;t of his career, one of his a&s;&s;ociates was tried and condemned, he, with tho&s;e that remained, heard and feared. Well had it been, if they had taken warning, and committed no more any &s;uch evil. But when they found that their companion, who met the ju&s;t reward of his deeds, made no di&s;covery of his accomplices, their fears vani&s;hed, and they returned to their for|mer cour&s;e. Now another, perhaps the mo&s;t bold and &s;ubtil of all, after having e&s;caped the vigil|ance of the civil magi&s;trate in &s;everal kingdoms of Europe, is this day to be offered a victim to pub|lic ju&s;tice. From the pa&s;t tenor of divine provi|dence towards &s;uch offenders, the probability is, that none of them will die a common death, but that all will &s;hare a &s;imilar fate with this criminal. If even his heart failed him for fear, le&s;t his ini|quity &s;hould be brought to light, how doth it now tremble? If this &s;pectacle of human depravity and mi&s;ery &s;hould prove a re&s;traint to others from com|mitting any &s;uch evil, it will not be exhibited in vain. They them&s;elves will have rea&s;on to ac|knowledge the divine goodne&s;s in giving them this warning&mdash;a check will be put to &s;uch evil in the &s;tate. This example of wrath will prai&s;e God. It may be heard of in the kingdoms where the
<PB N="14" REF="022446_0012_0FB889CC6CDFBB60">
pri&s;oner long perpetrated the mo&s;t flagitious crimes. It may be a means of bringing his confederates in vice to de&s;erved puni&s;hment, of detecting a band of villains, combined for the vile&s;t of purpo&s;es, and as dangerous to a community as the pe&s;tilence that walketh in darkne&s;s. It may be a re&s;traint to an horrible practice which hath long prevailed in Europe, and hath begun to prevail in this coun|try.</P>
<P>BUT whether it may be pre&s;umed or not, that this day's example may be thus exten&s;ively known, and be followed with &s;uch &s;alutary con&s;equences; it is at lea&s;t adapted to re&s;train any of a like cha|racter who may be witne&s;&s;es, or hear of it. In this view its de&s;ign is important to them, and to the community. If &s;uch a warning &s;hould not be hearkened to, it mu&s;t argue &s;tupidity and mad|ne&s;s in vice, which forebode &s;peedy de&s;truction from God and man. Seldom is there &s;uch an ex|ample, &s;uch a warning, as the pre&s;ent. God grant it may not be an admonition unregarded by &s;uch who&s;e degeneracy makes it a needful one to them. What fruit of his pa&s;t life hath this con|demned malefactor? The end is a premature, &s;hameful and violent death. In full health and &s;trength, in early life, in a moment, on a gibbet, he is to be di&s;patched into eternity. Compa&s;&s;ion it|&s;elf calls for it&mdash;public compa&s;&s;ion. I add, compa&s;|&s;ion al&s;o to &s;uch as have entred on a vicious cour&s;e, or may be in danger of being &s;educed. The pri&s;o|ner preacheth a better &s;ermon to &s;uch than I am a|ble. Look on him, ye who make a mock of &s;in; hear, and fear. Behold, ye de&s;pi&s;ers and wonder.
<PB N="15" REF="022446_0013_0FB889CE6034ACB8">
See an early wanderer from the path of good educati|on, an early de&s;pi&s;er of God and things &s;acred, one who has had no awe of &s;in and wrath, one who has &s;ported him&s;elf in the &s;poils of his fellow men, one who hath &s;peedily filled up his mea&s;ure of ini|quity, one of who&s;e untimely end you are to be witne&s;&s;es this day. Beware how you harden your|&s;elves after his example&mdash;&s;tifle the checks of con|&s;cience&mdash;hate in&s;truction, and de&s;pi&s;e reproof&mdash; how you join your&s;elves to company who are in the broad road to de&s;truction. Such was the ca&s;e with him who is now &s;et before you as a warning. He hath been almo&s;t in all evil, and is going to appear before the judge of all, to give account of him&s;elf. Should he, in this &s;ituation, have a feared con&s;cience, what thought more af|fecting!</P>
<P>THIS reminds us of another end of capital pun|i&s;hment mentioned at the beginning of my di&s;|cour&s;e. It re&s;pects the <HI>offender</HI> and a <HI>future</HI> world, as the former re&s;pected &s;ociety and the pre&s;ent world. This is a con&s;equence from our &s;ubject. For crimes which call for &s;uch &s;everity of puni&s;h|ment, which render it dangerous to &s;ociety that the criminal &s;hould any longer live on earth, mu&s;t needs be as <HI>&s;carlet and crim&s;on,</HI> and call for a re|pentance deep in proportion. When nothing &s;hort of death can expiate his crimes again&s;t his fellow-&s;ubjects or the &s;tate, his puni&s;hment is in|deed <HI>final</HI> as to <HI>this</HI> world. But in this la&s;t ex|tremity his &s;oul is commended to the divine mer|cy. What hath been ever u&s;ual under our happy government, ought to be the u&s;age in all, to allow
<PB N="16" REF="022446_0014_0FB889CF6D3D63F0">
the convict a &s;pace of repentance. To hurry him immediately from an earthly bar to the bar of God, (extraordinary ca&s;es excepted) &s;eems to argue want of &s;en&s;ibility and compa&s;&s;ion. To give him op|portunity to con&s;ider, and give glory to God be|fore he dies, is the united dictate of humanity, morality, and chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>THE &s;ituation of a condemned malefactor, con|fined and chained in a dark pri&s;on, an emblem of the &s;hadow of death, the day of his execution fix|ed, mu&s;t awaken reflection in one who is not to|tally abandoned. The providence of God intends it as a moral means of opening the ears to di&s;ci|pline. By this means hath he &s;ealed the in&s;truc|tion of &s;ome. The natural horror of death, the ad|ditional horror from the expectation of &s;uch a peculiar kind of death, conduce to arre&s;t the mind with apprehen&s;ions of eternal con&s;equences. Where &s;ome weeks are allowed between the &s;en|tence of death and the execution of it, there is time for mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration and penitential &s;or|row. The mind is not thrown into &s;uch agitati|on as precludes &s;ober reflection. In the &s;ituation above &s;uppo&s;ed, the malefactor, who&s;e mind is not exerci&s;ed with other thoughts than tho&s;e of tem|poral death, mu&s;t indeed be hardened through the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in. The &s;econd death, the wrath of an incen&s;ed Deity abiding on him, the day of the lamb's wrath, the greater damnation for hav|ing neglected a great &s;alvation, rai&s;e other appre|hen&s;ions than temporal de&s;truction. If the near view of the latter may be improved as a means of quickening him in flying from the wrath to come,
<PB N="17" REF="022446_0015_0FB889D11DC46450">
in this ca&s;e he that dies on a gibbet will have rea|&s;on to be thankful that his wickedne&s;s was di&s;co|vered, and met a merited puni&s;hment from public ju&s;tice. The expectation of the de&s;truction of the fle&s;h, through the operation of &s;overeign grace is a means of &s;aving the &s;oul from death, and of hi|ding a multitude of &s;ins. Such as "&s;it in dark|ne&s;s and in the &s;hadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; becau&s;e they rebelled again&s;t the words of God, and contemned the coun&s;el of the mo&s;t HIGH;" have had their heart brought down&mdash;have cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and been brought out of wor&s;e darkne&s;s than the dungeon of any pri&s;on on earth&mdash;wor&s;e chains than any outward ones have been broken.</P>
<P>THE &s;criptures mention a thief who found mer|cy on the cro&s;s. But he was a <HI>penitent,</HI> not a <HI>re|viler.</HI> There were <HI>two</HI> malefactors on the cro&s;s at the &s;ame time. One of them railed on the &s;uf|fering Redeemer, &s;aying, "Save thy&s;elf and us." The other rebuked his fellow, &s;aying, "Do&s;t thou not fear God, &s;eeing thou art in the &s;ame con|demnation? And we indeed ju&s;tly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done nothing ami&s;s." He proceeded, and "&s;aid unto Je&s;us, Lord, remember me when thou com|e&s;t into thy kingdom. And Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, Verily I &s;ay unto you, To day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e." You &s;ee to whom the&s;e reviving words were &s;poken&mdash;to one who had indeed been a notorious &s;inner in his life, was capitally con|demned, and brought forth to execution. But he was fully convinced of the enormities of his
<PB N="18" REF="022446_0016_0FB889D26BE555D0">
life, the ju&s;tice of the puni&s;hment to which he was doomed, and feared the wrath of God more than that of man. His trial and pri&s;on awakened his con&s;cience: He was re&s;igned to his de&s;tiny as what he had merited: He admini&s;tred a mo&s;t per|tinent reproof to his companion in &s;in, who with an air of levity, and with ridicule on his tongue, was &s;uffering a capital puni&s;hment&mdash;ridicule point|ed at the holy and ju&s;t ONE, who was then endu|ring the cro&s;s to &s;ave mankind, and while he hung on the cro&s;s prayed for revilers and murderers, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." In the&s;e circum&s;tances of ignominy, the other malefactor condemned him&s;elf, ju&s;tified God, rebuked the reviler, bore te&s;timony to the innocence of Je&s;us, confe&s;&s;ed him as the Chri&s;t of God, and was an earne&s;t, a &s;ucce&s;sful &s;uitor for mercy. Whoever with like penitence and faith applies for mercy, &s;hall find it, though at the la&s;t hour of life.</P>
<P>BUT what encouragement doth this in&s;tance af|ford to the unbelieving, unconcerned &s;inner? what encouragement to one who laughs at de&s;truction, and dies deriding Chri&s;t, in&s;tead of expre&s;&s;ing hum|ble faith in him? All manner of &s;in is forgiven for his &s;ake to the penitent. The gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;inners have been wa&s;hed&punc; &s;anctified, and ju&s;tified in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the Spirit of our God. They who have <HI>much forgiven</HI> them, are &s;en&s;ible of the obligation, and <HI>love much.</HI> They are found weeping at the feet of Je&s;us. Or with the prodigal, not while wa&s;ting his &s;ub&s;tance in riot; but when he came to him&s;elf, and re&s;olved, "I
<PB N="19" REF="022446_0017_0FB889D3EC36F840">
will ari&s;e, and go to my father, and &s;ay, Father, I have &s;inned again&s;t heaven, and before thee." Or with the publican, who "would not lift up &s;o much as his eyes to heaven, but &s;mote on his brea&s;t, &s;aying, God be merciful to me a &s;inner." When great &s;inners are thus overwhelmed with grief and &s;hame; thus &s;ee the purity of God, and abhor them&s;elves; thus look to him whom they have pierced, and are in bitterne&s;s of &s;oul, then may they have hope. For Je&s;us was <HI>&s;ent to heal the broken hearted.</HI> The &s;acrifices of God are a contrite &s;pirit.</P>
<P>BUT &s;hall we talk wickedly and deceitfully for God? Shall we &s;peak comfortably, while the workers of iniquity boa&s;t them&s;elves? while they &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t the Lord, and again&s;t his a|nointed? while they think to out-brazen HIS wrath, at who&s;e "pre&s;ence the mountains quake, and the hills melt, and the world and all therein are burnt? Who can &s;tand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fiercene&s;s of his anger? Ki&s;s the Son, le&s;t he be angry, and ye peri&s;h."</P>
<P>THERE is danger, great danger, of mi&s;applying and perverting the grace of the go&s;pel. On the very favourable &s;uppo&s;ition of true repentance at the clo&s;e of a profligate life, there will not be the be&s;t evidence of the reality of &s;uch repentance. Op|portunity is not left to manife&s;t the &s;incerity and bring forth the fruits of it. There cannot then be the comfort and hope which is greatly to be de&s;ired. There is not &s;pace to efface, by the ex|ample of his repentance, the reproach which the delaying and pre&s;umptuous &s;inner hath brought on
<PB N="20" REF="022446_0018_0FB889D5DA093CC8">
the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity and of virtue. There is not time to undo what he hath done again&s;t God and his fellow-men.</P>
<P>THESE things we ob&s;erve on the favourable &s;uppo&s;ition of true evangelical repentance, after a life &s;pent in vicious indulgence. But &s;uch repen|tance is rare. More generally tho&s;e who have de&s;pi&s;ed the riches of God's goodne&s;s, forbearance and long-&s;uffering till the clo&s;e of their days, go on &s;till indulging an hard and impenitent heart, trea&s;uring up wrath again&s;t the day of wrath: Some remarkable providence may, in a few in&s;tan|ces, have rou&s;ed open and flagitious &s;inners from their &s;ecurity, &s;o that a bad life may have ended well. But though this may be a rea&s;on why none &s;hould <HI>de&s;pair,</HI> who have thus wa&s;ted life, is it not as forcible a rea&s;on why none &s;hould <HI>pre&s;ume</HI> thus to wa&s;te it? Would you thru&s;t forward the main bu&s;ine&s;s of life into the la&s;t day and hour of it? Yea, would you refer to your dying hour, not on|ly the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of life, but al&s;o the much more difficult bu&s;ine&s;s of reforming and renounc|ing habits of &s;in and exce&s;s? Is not the natural bitterne&s;s of death enough, without the greater bitterne&s;s of &s;in unrepented of, and uncancelled? Laden with an heavy load of guilt, which, with|out any additional load of infirmity, would he hea|vy enough, how will the &s;inner, on the verge of eternity, &s;upport his own reflections!</P>
<P>WHATEVER a&s;pect any of the preceding re|flections may have on &s;uch as have lived without God in the world, and at the end of their days mourn thus, "How have I hated in&s;truction, and
<PB N="21" REF="022446_0019_0FB889D6EC104218">
my heart de&s;pi&s;ed reproof,"&mdash;whatever a&s;pect they may have on the &s;tate of the unhappy man here before us; they are, I am per&s;uaded, the words of truth and &s;oberne&s;s. However di&s;tre&s;&s;ed we may feel for him, we may not, in this la&s;t in&s;truc|tion to him, hold up fallacious hopes; nor give countenance to others, who are warned by this example to <HI>hear</HI> and <HI>fear.</HI></P>
<P>YET once more am I called to adddre&s;s you, <HI>Jo&s;eph Mountain.</HI> No more will you hear the coun&s;el of God from any of his mini&s;ters. The bounds are &s;et which you cannot pa&s;s. <HI>The judge,</HI> your eternal judge, now <HI>&s;tandeth before the door.</HI> This day, in about three hours, you mu&s;t die&mdash; mu&s;t be hanged as a &s;pectacle to the world, a warning to the vicious. Had I not been very &s;en|&s;ibly affected&mdash;were I not now e&s;pecially affected, with your &s;ituation, I &s;hould be a&s;hamed of my|&s;elf as a man, more as a Chri&s;tian, and yet more as a Chri&s;tian mini&s;ter. It is a weighty argument with us to warn the wicked, that we watch for &s;ouls as tho&s;e that mu&s;t give account. If warn|ing is not given them, and they die in their ini|quity, their blood will be required at the watch|man's hand. He is &s;ometimes &s;ent with this mo&s;t melancholy me&s;&s;age, "Hear ye indeed, but under|&s;tand not; and &s;ee ye indeed, but perceive not." But this de&s;perate me&s;&s;age no &s;piritual watchmen may directly apply to any, unle&s;s divinely in&s;pir|ed, and commi&s;&s;ioned in an extraordinary manner. Our general encouragement to warn and reprove is this: "If any do err from the truth, and one
<PB N="22" REF="022446_0020_0FB889D86DA83798">
convert him; let him know that he who convert|eth the &s;inner from the error of his way, &s;hall &s;ave a &s;oul from death, and &s;hall hide a multitude of &s;ins." Great &s;inners may be reclaimed. With God all things are po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>SOME &s;inners, if &s;aved at all, are plucked as <HI>a brand out of the fire.</HI> And this, I am compelled to tell you, is the utmo&s;t we can hope concerning you. Had not the levity of your mind, during the fir&s;t part of your impri&s;onment, prevented, I &s;hould have cho&s;en another text for the pre&s;ent melancholy occa&s;ion. Since your confinement you have by no means given the be&s;t evidence of true contrition. Your circum&s;tances have called upon you, and Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters have called upon you, to repent in du&s;t and a&s;hes&mdash;to e&s;cape for your life, to flee for refuge to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who &s;aveth from &s;in, and from the wrath to come. How many and fervent prayers have been offered for you in public and private? We have tried to per&s;uade our&s;elves that you were a <HI>pri&s;oner of hope,</HI> and have mo&s;t affectionately warned and intreated you to <HI>turn to the &s;trong hold.</HI> And did I not think it at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible, that there may yet be mercy in &s;tore for you, I &s;hould hardly have com|plied with your reque&s;t to preach to you this day. Unto you, therefore, I once more call. You are ready to be offered a victim to public ju&s;tice. Wherefore, in the language of the holy Gho&s;t, "TO DAY, if you will hear his voice, harden not not your heart."</P>
<P>IF the hi&s;tory of your life, taken from your own mouth, and this day publi&s;hed, may be credited,
<PB N="23" REF="022446_0021_0FB889DA61CC2150">
you have been almo&s;t in all evil for &s;ixteen years pa&s;t; that is, ever &s;ince you were &s;eventeen years old, and left your ma&s;ter's family. You have per|&s;onally, and in company with others, been guilty of high-way <HI>robbery</HI> in about twenty in&s;tances; of <HI>burglary</HI> once at lea&s;t; of <HI>theft</HI> repeatedly; and for <HI>rape</HI> you are now to be executed. From rob|bery you have proceeded to <HI>gaming, riot</HI> and <HI>de|bauch,</HI> and from the&s;e to robbery. How many have you &s;educed? How many have you ruined in their character and e&s;tate? From early youth to thirty three years you have lived in &s;loth, di&s;&s;ipati|on, lewdne&s;s and violence. You have gone to and fro in the earth, as Satan your ma&s;ter, &s;eeking whom you might devour. You have &s;pent your days in contempt of every duty to God and your fellow-men, and gloried in your &s;hame. You have merited the puni&s;hment you are now to &s;uf|fer more than twenty times. I &s;ay this on the &s;up|po&s;ition that you are &s;uch a per&s;on as you have now told the world. If your hi&s;tory is fal&s;e, your de|pravity is equally manife&s;t. For then, as you go out of the world, you mock at the mo&s;t pre&s;ump|tuous &s;ins. You boa&s;t of <HI>pretended</HI> valor as a vil|lain, in the moment of death. Yea, you die with an act of the deepe&s;t inju&s;tice to numbers of your fellow-men, whom you now accu&s;e of a confede|racy with you, for a number of years, in capital crimes. You &s;till per&s;i&s;t to affirm, that the hi&s;|tory you have given of your life is true in every particular. You can reap no advantage from de|ceiving the world in which you are no longer to live. I &s;hall therefore &s;uppo&s;e that you have &s;aid
<PB N="24" REF="022446_0022_0FB889DB6BCEC478">
the truth. Your pa&s;t unprincipled and &s;hamele&s;s character, and this only, can explain that apparent indifference to your &s;tate, during a great part of your impri&s;onment, which hath a&s;toni&s;hed us. Should you wi&s;h to leave behind you a character for &s;kill and bravery as a thief or robber, a rioter in the &s;poils of your fellow-men&mdash;Should you now think of thus outbraving the wrath of the mo&s;t HIGH, the la&s;t act of your life would be yet more pre&s;umptuous than any or all your <HI>great tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions.</HI> God forbid that you &s;hould harbour a thought of thus filling up the &s;um of your wick|edne&s;s&mdash;that you &s;hould thus with madne&s;s in your heart go down to the dead. Your name, crimes and puni&s;hment will be remembred, we hope, that others may hear and fear, and commit no &s;uch evil. Though young in years, you are old in &s;in.</P>
<P>WERE a pardon from man this day offered, how would it affect you, while your heart is trem|bling for fear of the tragical death before you? But it is un&s;afe for the world that you &s;hould live. You have lived a nui&s;ance on earth. You mu&s;t therefore be executed. There is no reprieve for you. Yet a pardon from God is even now offer|ed you, if you repent; otherwi&s;e you mu&s;t peri&s;h in a more deplorable &s;en&s;e than is implied in the &s;trange puni&s;hment which awaits you. If de&s;|truction from man be a terror, de&s;truction from God is much more. There is a world to come. There is an omni&s;cient, holy and righteous judge. The great Redeemer will be revealed from heav|en in flaming fire. Then &s;uch as have trampled him under foot, &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;t|ing
<PB N="25" REF="022446_0023_0FB889DCEEFDBD48">
de&s;truction from his pre&s;ence. In that day &s;uch will be the lively horror of hardned, but then too late awakened &s;inners, that they will cry to the rocks and mountains to fall on them, and co|ver them from the face of the Lamb, who&s;e wrath they have inflamed. Is it not now high time for you to "con&s;ider this, le&s;t he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver? The ungodly &s;hall not &s;tand in judgment, nor &s;inners in the congre|gation of the righteous." Of what va&s;t moment then is it, that you "acquaint your&s;elf NOW with him, and be at peace?" How have you improv|ed the &s;pace &s;ince you were tried and condemned at man's bar, in preparing to &s;tand before the bar of the great judge of the world? I fear you can|not give a good an&s;wer to this que&s;tion. A few moments are yet left you. <HI>Who can tell but God may have mercy?</HI> There is plenteous redempti|on with him. Fall down before him in the deep|e&s;t contrition of &s;oul. Own the ju&s;tice of your &s;entence. In the depths of di&s;tre&s;s cry to him, "Lord, &s;ave me; I peri&s;h." Let free and &s;ove|reign grace in the Mediator be your plea. I be|&s;eech you, be reconciled to God. I be&s;eech you as an amba&s;&s;ador of Chri&s;t, and in his &s;tead, who made peace by the blood of his cro&s;s; in whom all fulne&s;s dwells; who hath the words of eternal life; who hath the keys of hell and of death; who will come in glory, and call you and all mankind to account; who will pronounce the final &s;en|tence, "Come ye ble&s;&s;ed," or, "Depart ye cur&s;|ed."&mdash;In his &s;tead I be&s;eech you, for the la&s;t time, BE RECONCILED TO GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="022446_0024_0FB889DE6C7EE650">My hearers, we have before us one, who&s;e boa&s;t it has been, that he was pre-eminent in the &s;kill and valour of an highway-man; who &s;eems to have accounted this an honorable acqui&s;ition, and hath blended with it, as the natural con&s;e|quence, various other, and equally atrocious crimes. The la&s;t, for which he is to &s;uffer death, be&s;ides its enormity in its own nature, was attended with circum&s;tances which &s;hewed that he had ca&s;t off all &s;hame, and even all fear of detection; that he feared not the eye of the world any more than that of God.</P>
<P>HE began his career of wickedne&s;s at or before <HI>&s;eventeen.</HI> This is the mo&s;t critical and danger|ous &s;tage of life. From this circum&s;tance, and this example, I may therefore very pertinently take occa&s;ion to caution our <HI>young</HI> people again&s;t the follies and temptations to which their inexperi|ence and impetuo&s;ity expo&s;e them. See in this in&s;tance of what moment it is to form early habits of virtue&mdash;to hear coun&s;el, and turn at reproof&mdash; to &s;hun the paths of vice. Happy the youth who "walketh not in the coun&s;el of the ungodly, nor &s;tandeth in the way of &s;inners, nor &s;itteth in the &s;eat of the &s;cornful." Small &s;ins lead to great ones. <HI>The beginning</HI> of a vicious cour&s;e, as that of <HI>&s;trife,</HI> is like <HI>the letting out water.</HI> Wherefore "ab&s;tain from all appearance of evil." Re&s;i&s;t the fir&s;t &s;olicitation, as he, "How can I do this great evil, and &s;in again&s;t God?" Whenever tempted, allow time for this reflection, "Thou, Lord, &s;ee&s;t me." "Can the ethiopian change his &s;kin, or the leopard his &s;pots? then may tho&s;e who have
<PB N="27" REF="022446_0025_0FB889DFEE2CB1A8">
been accu&s;tomed to do evil, learn to do well." How melancholy a comment on the&s;e words doth the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion afford? When &s;inners have a&s;&s;umed the boldne&s;s to leap over the boundaries of laws human and divine, they gradually lo&s;e all tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience, and proceed from evil to evil. What is particularly &s;aid of the i&s;&s;ue of un|lawful plea&s;ure, may be applied to any other vicious cour&s;e: It is "the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death." We therefore be&s;eech tho&s;e who are yet young, by the &s;orrowful example they here behold, that they for&s;ake not "the guide of their youth; that they be not wi&s;e in their own eyes: Fear the Lord, and depart from evil." The choice they make, the cour&s;e they enter upon in early youth, is of un&s;peakable importance, both with re&s;pect to this world and another. Would to God that the pre&s;ent warning may not be an un|profitable one! that they may &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity and advantage of &s;ubmitting to &s;alutary re&s;traint, and tru&s;t the wi&s;dom of their &s;uperiors, in&s;tead of do|ing what &s;eemeth right in their own eyes. When the &s;corner is puni&s;hed, the &s;imple is made wi&s;e.</P>
<P>FURTHER, have any by fal&s;e accu&s;ation, or &s;e|cret fraud, or extortion, or otherwi&s;e, deeply in|jured their fellow-men? They will do well to a&s;k, whether, in the view of the heart-&s;earching God, they may not be as verily guilty concerning their brother, as tho&s;e who have injured him more gro&s;&s;ly, and are &s;ubjected to ignominious puni&s;h|ment from civil government? Do the checks of con&s;cience, or force of human laws, or a &s;en&s;e of public &s;hame, re&s;train men from &s;uch enormities
<PB N="28" REF="022446_0026_0FB889E1E491CD18">
as the pri&s;oner hath been addicted to? And &s;hould not the all-&s;eeing eye of God re&s;train from all inju&s;tice to men? yea, from all &s;in either again&s;t God, or man, or our&s;elves? Should it not influence to keep the heart with all diligence? Do men take pains to &s;ave appear|ances? How much greater rea&s;on have they to ap|prove them&s;elves to him who &s;earcheth the reins and hearts; and will give to every man according to his works?</P>
<P>MAY all who indulge vicious pa&s;&s;ions be warned by the event of this day. May the con&s;equences of idlene&s;s, gaming and di&s;&s;ipation, of lu&s;t and an ungo|verned &s;pirit, fal&s;hood and greedine&s;s of gain, the tem|poral and eternal con&s;equences, be well con&s;idered. The&s;e things impel men into cour&s;es de&s;tructive of their peace, and of their &s;ouls. From &s;mall beginnings they increa&s;e to more ungodline&s;s. Tho' timid at fir&s;t, they &s;oon become capable of bold exploits, and prove veterans in vice. But few who enter the&s;e paths, re|turn again. The few who do, find it extremely diffi|cult to tread back the wrong &s;teps they have taken. The gains of vice are hard, perilous and momentary. The triumph of its votaries is &s;hort. They travel with pain all their days. They know not the way of peace, becau&s;e they fear not God. Their own coun&s;el ca&s;t|eth them down. "The heaven &s;hall reveal their ini|quity, and the earth &s;hall ri&s;e up again&s;t them. They &s;hall be driven from light into darkne&s;s, and cha&s;ed out of the world. The Lord's throne is in heaven. His eyes behold the children of men. He trieth the righte|ous; but the wicked and him that loveth violence his &s;oul hateth. Upon the wicked he &s;hall rain &s;nares, fire and brim&s;tone, and an horrible tempe&s;t: This &s;hall be the portion of their cup." But <HI>the fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, to depart from the &s;nares of death.</HI></P>
