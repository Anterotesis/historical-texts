<P><HI>THE following Sermons, I think I may &s;ay, were given me by the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and according to my pre&s;ent light, are agreeable to the form of &s;ound words delivered to us in the lively oracles of God.

to preach upon the &s;ame &s;ubjects, I was obliged, according to the free|dom and a&s;&s;i&s;tance given me from above, to enlarge, or make excur&s;ions, agree|able to the people's circum&s;tances among whom I was preaching the kingdom of God.

<HEAD>THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JEREMIAH xxiii. 6.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>The Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHOEVER is acquainted with the nature of mankind in general, or the propen&s;ity of his own heart in particular, mu&s;t acknowledge that &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s is the la&s;t idol that is rooted out of the heart.&mdash;Being once born under a covenant of works, it is natural for us all to have recour&s;e to a covenant of works for our everla&s;ting &s;alvation. And we have contracted &s;uch a devili&s;h pride by our fall from God, that we would, if not wholly, yet in part at lea&s;t, glory in being the cau&s;e of our own &s;alvation. We cry out again&s;t Popery, and that very ju&s;tly; but we are all Papi&s;ts, at lea&s;t I am &s;ure we are all Arminians by nature; and therefore, no wonder &s;o many natural men em|brace that &s;cheme. It is true, we di&s;claim the doctrine of merit, are a&s;hamed directly to &s;ay we de&s;erve any good at the hands of God; therefore as the apo&s;tle excellently well ob&s;erves, we go a|bout, we fetch a circuit, to e&s;tabli&s;h a righteou&s;|ne&s;s of our own, and, like the phari&s;ees of old,
<PB N="12" REF="029886_0009_0FE2BE4375BCBE90">
will not wholly &s;ubmit to that righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P>
<P>This is the &s;ore&s;t, though alas! the mo&s;t com|mon evil that was ever yet &s;een under the &s;un. An evil, that in any age, e&s;pecially in the&s;e dregs of time wherein we live, cannot &s;ufficiently be in|veighed again&s;t&mdash;For as it is with the people, &s;o it is with the prie&s;ts; and it is to be feared, even in tho&s;e places where once the truth, as it is in Je&s;us, was eminently preached, many mini&s;ters are &s;o &s;adly degenerated from their pious ance&s;tors, that the doctrines of grace, e&s;pecially the per&s;onal all-&s;ufficient righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us, is but too &s;el|dom, too &s;lightly mentioned. Hence the love of many waxeth cold; and&punc; I have too often thought was it po&s;&s;ible, that this &s;ingle con&s;ideration would be &s;ufficient to rai&s;e our venerable forefathers again from their graves; who would thunder in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ars their fatal error.</P>
<P>The righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is one of tho&s;e great my&s;teries which the angels de&s;ire to <HI>look into,</HI> and &s;eems to be one of the fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons that God taught men after the fall. For what were the coats that God made to put on our fir&s;t parents, but types of the application of the merits or righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to believers hearts? We are told, that tho&s;e coats were made of &s;kins of bea&s;ts, and as bea&s;ts were not then food for men, we may fairly infer, that tho&s;e bea&s;ts were &s;lain in &s;acrifice, in commemoration of the great &s;acrifice Je&s;us Chri&s;t thereafter to be offered. And the &s;kins of tho&s;e bea&s;ts thus &s;lain, being put on Adam and Eve, they were thereby taught <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ow their nakedne&s;s was to be covered with the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lamb of God.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="029886_0010_0FE2BEE238FF5AB8">
This is it which is meant, when we are told A|braham believed on the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s. In &s;hort, this is it of which the law and all the prophets have &s;poken, e&s;pecially Jeremiah in the words of the text&mdash;<HI>The Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;</P>

</LIST></P>
<P>I. I am to con&s;ider who we are to under&s;tand by the word <HI>Lord&mdash;The Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>And if any Arians or Socinians are drawn by cu|rio&s;ity to hear what the babler has to &s;ay, let them be a&s;hamed of denying the divinity of that Lord that has bought poor &s;inners by his precious blood. For the Per&s;on mentioned in the text under the character of <HI>Lord,</HI> is Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;<HI>Behold,</HI> ver. 5. <HI>the days come, &s;aith the Lord, that I will rai&s;e unto David a righteous branch, a King &s;hall reign and pro&s;|per, &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> judgment and ju&s;tice in the earth.&mdash;In his days,</HI> ver. 6. <HI>Judah &s;hall be &s;aved, and I&s;rael &s;hall dwell &s;afely, and this is his name whereby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;hall be called, The Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;By the <HI>righte|ous&punc; Branch,</HI> all agree that we are to under&s;tand Je|&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;He it is that is called the Lord in our text. If &s;o, if there were no other text in the Bi|ble
<PB N="14" REF="029886_0011_0FE2BE488F02C9E8">
to prove the divinity of Chri&s;t, that is &s;uffici|ent. For if the word <HI>Lord</HI> may properly belong to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He mu&s;t be God. For as you have it in the margins of your Bibles, the word <HI>Lord</HI> is in the original <HI>Jehovah,</HI> which is the e&s;&s;en|tial title of God him&s;elf. Come then, ye Arians, ki&s;s the Son of God, bow down before him, and honour him, even as you honour the Father, Learn of the angels tho&s;e morning &s;tars, and wor&s;hip him as truly God.&mdash;For otherwi&s;e you are as much idolaters, as tho&s;e that wor&s;hip the Virgin Mary. And as for you Socinians, who &s;ay Chri&s;t was a mere man, and yet profe&s;s that he was your Sa|viour, according to your own principles you are accur&s;ed. For, if Chri&s;t be a mere man, then he is only an arm of fle&s;h.&mdash;And it is written, <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that tru&s;teth on an arm of fle&s;h.</HI>&mdash;But I would hope there are no &s;uch mon&s;ters here. At lea&s;t, that after the&s;e con&s;iderations, they would be a|&s;hamed of broaching &s;uch mon&s;trous ab&s;urdities any more.&mdash;For it is plain, that by the word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> we are to under&s;tand the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who here takes to him&s;elf the title of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> and therefore mu&s;t be very God of very God, or, as the apo&s;tle devoutly expre&s;&s;es it, God <HI>ble&s;&s;ed for ever.</HI></P>
<P>How the Lord is to be <HI>man's righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> comes next to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>And that is, in one word, by <HI>imputation.</HI>&mdash;For it plea&s;ed God, after he had made all things <HI>by the word of his power,</HI> to create man after his own im|age. And &s;o infinite was the conde&s;cen&s;ion of the high and lofty One, who inhabiteth eternity, that although he might have in&s;i&s;ted on the everla&s;ting obedience of him and his po&s;terity, yet he was plea&s;|ed to oblige him&s;elf, by a covenant or agreement
<PB N="15" REF="029886_0012_0FE2BEECB98DE6E8">
made with his own creatures, upon condition of an un&s;inning obedience, to give them immortality and eternal life.&mdash;For when it is &s;aid, <HI>the day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die,</HI> we may fairly infer, &s;o long as he continued obedient, and did not eat thereof, he &s;hould &s;urely live.&mdash;The 3d of Gene&s;is gives us a full, but mournful account&punc; how our fir&s;t parents broke this covenant, and thereby &s;tood in need of a better righteou&s;ne&s;s than their own, in order to procure their future acceptance with God. For what mu&s;t they do? They were as much un|der a covenant of works, as ever. And, though after their di&s;obedience they were without &s;trength, yet they were obliged not only to do, but continue to do all things, and that too in the mo&s;t perfect manner which the Lord had required of them.&mdash;And not only &s;o, but to make &s;atisfaction to God's infinitely offended ju&s;tice, for the breach they had already been guilty of.&mdash;Here then opens the amazing &s;cene of divine philanthropy&mdash;I mean God's love to man&mdash;For behold, what man could not do, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Son of his Father's love, undertakes to do for him. And that God might be ju&s;t in ju&s;tifying the ungodly, though he was in the form of God, and therefore thought it no rob|bery to be equal with God, yet he took upon him the form of a &s;ervant, even human nature.&mdash;In that nature he obeyed, and thereby fulfilled the whole moral law in our &s;tead&mdash;And al&s;o died a painful death upon the cro&s;s, and thereby became a cur&s;e for, or in&s;tead of, tho&s;e whom the Father had given him. As God, he &s;atisfied at the &s;ame time that he obeyed, and &s;uffered as man; and being God and man, in one per&s;on&punc; wrought out a full, perfect and &s;ufficient righteou&s;ne&s;s for all to whom it was to be imputed.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="029886_0013_0FE2BE544D032188">
Here then we &s;ee the meaning of the word <HI>righ|teou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> It implies the active, as well as pa&s;&s;ive obedience of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. We general|ly, when talking of the merits of Chri&s;t, only men|tion the latter, <HI>viz&punc;</HI>&mdash;his death; whereas the for|mer, <HI>viz.</HI> his life and active obedience is equally nece&s;&s;ary. Chri&s;t is not &s;uch a Saviour as becomes us, unle&s;s we join both together.&mdash;Chri&s;t not only died, but lived; not only &s;uffered, but obeyed, for or in&s;tead of poor &s;inners. And both the&s;e jointly make up that complete righteou&s;ne&s;s which is to be imputed to us, as the di&s;obedience of our fir&s;t parents was made ours by <HI>imputation.</HI> In this &s;en&s;e, and no other, are we to under&s;tand that parallel which St. Paul draws in the 5th of the Romans, between the fir&s;t and &s;econd Adam. This is what he el&s;ewhere terms our <HI>being made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him.</HI> This is the &s;en&s;e wherein the pro|phet would have us to under&s;tand the words of the text; therefore chap. xxx. ver. 16. <HI>She, i. e.</HI> the church it&s;elf &s;hall be called (having this righteou&s;|ne&s;s imputed to her) the <HI>Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;A pa&s;&s;age, I think, worthy the profounde&s;t medi|tation of all the &s;ons and daughters of Abraham.</P>
<P>Many are the objections which the proud hearts of fallen men are continually urging again&s;t this whole&s;ome, this divine, this &s;oul-&s;aving doctrine. I come now in the third place, to an&s;wer &s;ome few of tho&s;e which I think the mo&s;t con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, they &s;ay, becau&s;e they would appear friends to morality, <Q>That the doctrine of an im|puted righteou&s;ne&s;s is de&s;tructive of good works, and leads to licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>And who pray are the per&s;ons that generally urge this objection? Are they men full of faith, and men really concerned for good works? No, what|ever
<PB N="17" REF="029886_0014_0FE2BEF18AEEB8A8">
few exceptions there may be, if there be any at all, its notorious, they are generally men of cor|rupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. The be&s;t title I can give them is, that of prophane mor|ali&s;ts, or morali&s;ts fal&s;ely &s;o called. For I appeal to the experience of the pre&s;ent, as well as pa&s;t ages, if iniquity did and does not mo&s;t abound where the doctrine of Chri&s;t's whole per&s;onal righ|teou&s;ne&s;s is mo&s;t cried down, and mo&s;t &s;eldom mentioned.&mdash;Arminian being Antichri&s;tian princi|ples, always did, and always will lead to Antichri&s;|tian practices. And never was there a reformation brought about in the church, but by the preach|ing the doctrine of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;This, as that man of God, Luther calls it, is <HI>Ar|ticulus Stantis aut Cadentis Eccle&s;iae,</HI> the article by which the church &s;tands or falls.&mdash;And though the preachers of this doctrine are generally branded by tho&s;e on the other &s;ide with the approbrious names of Antinomians, deceivers, and what not! yet, I believe&punc; if the truth of the doctrine on both &s;ides was to be judged of by the lives of the preachers and profe&s;&s;ors of it, their's on our &s;ide the que&s;tion, would have the advantage every way.</P>
<P>Its true, this, as well as every other doctrine of grace, may be abu&s;ed. And perhaps the unchri&s;|tian walk of &s;ome, who have talked of Chri&s;t's im|puted righteou&s;ne&s;s, ju&s;tification by faith, and the like, and yet never felt it imputed to their own &s;ouls, has given the enemies of the Lord thus cau&s;e to bla&s;pheme. But this is a very un&s;afe, as well as very unfair way of arguing.&mdash;The only que&s;tion &s;hould be, Whether or no this doctrine of an im|puted righteou&s;ne&s;s does it&s;elf cut off the occa&s;ion of good works, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ead to licentiou&s;ne&s;s? No, in no wi&s;e. It excludes works indeed from being any
<PB N="18" REF="029886_0015_0FE2BE58F07D8F18">
cau&s;e of our ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God.&mdash;But it requires good works as a proof of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ur hav|ing this righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed to us, and as a de|clarative evidence of our ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of men. And then how can the doctrine of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, be a doctrine leading to li|centiou&s;ne&s;s?</P>
<P>Its all calumny.&mdash;St. Paul introduces an infidel making this objection in his epi&s;tle to the Romans.&mdash;And none but infidels, that never felt the power of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection upon their &s;ouls, will urge it over again.&mdash;And therefore, notwith&s;tanding this objection, with the prophet in the text we may boldly &s;ay, <HI>The Lord is our righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But Satan (and no wonder that his &s;ervants im|itate him) often <HI>transforms him&s;elf into an angel of light.</HI> And therefore (&s;uch perver&s;e things will in|fidelity and Arminiani&s;m make men &s;peak) in or|der to dre&s;s their objections in the be&s;t colours.&mdash;Some urge, <Q>that our Saviour preached on &s;uch doctrine&mdash;that in his &s;ermon upon the Mount, He mentions only morality;</Q> and con&s;equently the doctrine of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s falls whol|ly to the ground.&mdash;</P>
<P>But &s;urely the men, who urge this objection, ei|ther have not read, or never under&s;tood our Lord's ble&s;&s;ed di&s;cour&s;e, wherein the doctrine of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;o plainly taught, that he that runs, if he has eyes that &s;ee, may read.</P>
<P>Indeed our Lord does recommend morality and good works (as all faithful mini&s;ters will do) and clears the moral law from the many corrupt glo&s;&s;es put upon it by the letter-learned Phari&s;ees.&mdash;But then, before he comes to this, its remarkable, he talks of inward piety, &s;uch as poverty of &s;pirit, meekne&s;s, holy mourning, purity of heart,&mdash;e&s;pe|cially

<P>We may &s;tate it thus:&mdash;<Q>The evangeli&s;t St&punc; Mark, &s;ay they, chap. x. mentions a young man that came to Chri&s;t, running and a&s;king him what he &s;hould do to in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> eternal life?

is plain therefore, works were to be partly at lea&s;t, the cau&s;e of his ju&s;tification; and con&s;e|quently the doctrine of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s is un&s;criptural.</Q>&mdash;This is the objection in its full &s;trength; and little &s;trength in all its fulne&s;s. For, was I to prove the nece&s;&s;ity of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, I &s;carce know how I could bring a better in&s;tance to make it good.</P>
<P>Let us take a more intimate view of this young man, and our Lord's behaviour towards him, Mark x. 17. the evangeli&s;t tells us, <Q>That when Chri&s;t was gone forth into the way, there came one running (it &s;hould &s;eem it was &s;ome nobleman, a rarity indeed, to &s;ee &s;uch a one running to Chri&s;t!) and not only &s;o, but he kneeled to him (though perhaps many of his rank &s;carce knew the time when they kneeled to Chri&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and <HI>a&s;k|ed him, &s;aving, Good Ma&s;ter, what &s;hall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?</HI></Q>&mdash;Then Je&s;us, to &s;ee whether or not he believed him to be what he real|ly was, truly, properly God, &s;aid unto him, <HI>Why calle&s;t thou me Good? There is none good, but one, that is God.</HI>&mdash;And that he might directly an&s;wer his que&s;tion; &s;ays he, <HI>Thou knowe&s;t the command|ments: Do not commit adultery, Do not bear fal&s;e wit|ne&s;s, Defraud <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, Honour thy father and mother.</HI>&mdash;This, I &s;ay, was a direct an&s;wer to his que&s;tion; namely, that eternal life was not to be attained by his doings.&mdash;For our Lord, by referring him to the commandments, did not (as the objecters in&s;inuate) in the lea&s;t hint, that his morality would recom|mend him to the favour and mercy of God.&mdash;But he intended thereby to make the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his &s;chool|ma&s;ter to bring him to him&s;elf; that the young man, &s;eeing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> broken every one of the&s;e commandments, might thereby <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e convinced o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

the in&s;ufficiency of his own, and con&s;equently the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of looking out for a better righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, whereon he might depend for eternal life.</P>
<P>This was what our Lord de&s;igned.&mdash;The young man being &s;elf-righteous, and willing to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, &s;aid, <HI>All the&s;e have I ob&s;erved from my youth.</HI> But had he known him&s;elf, he would have confe&s;|&s;ed, <HI>All the&s;e have I broke from my youth.</HI>&mdash;For &s;up|po&s;ing he had not actually committed adultery, had he never lu&s;ted after a woman in his heart? What if he had not really killed another; had he never been angry without a cau&s;e, or &s;poken unad|vi&s;edly with his lips? If &s;o, by breaking one of the lea&s;t commandments in the lea&s;t degree, he be|came liable to the cur&s;e of God: For <HI>cur&s;ed is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> (&s;aith the law) <HI>that continueth not to do all things that are written in this book.</HI>"&mdash;And therefore, as I ob&s;erved before, our Lord was &s;o far from &s;peaking again&s;t, that he treated the young man in that man|ner, on purpo&s;e to convince him of the nece&s;&s;ity of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>But perhaps they will reply, it is &s;aid, <HI>Je&s;us be|holding him loved him.</HI> And what then? This he might do with a human love, and at the &s;ame time this young man have no intere&s;t in his blood.&mdash;Thus Chri&s;t is &s;aid to wonder&mdash;to weep over Je|ru&s;alem, and &s;ay&mdash;<HI>Oh that thou had&s;t</HI> KNOWN, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But &s;uch like pa&s;&s;ages are to be referred only to his human nature. And there is a great deal of difference between the love wherewith Chri&s;t loved this young man, and that wherewith he loved Ma|ry, Lazarus, and their &s;i&s;ter Martha.&mdash;To illu&s;trate this by a compari&s;on.&mdash;A mini&s;ter of the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;eeing many amiable di&s;po&s;itions, &s;uch as readine&s;s to hear the word, and decent behaviour

at public wor&s;hip, a life outwardly &s;potle&s;s in ma|ny, cannot but &s;o far love them. But then there is much difference betwixt that love which a mini|&s;ter feels for &s;uch, and that divine love, that union and &s;ympathy of &s;oul, which he feels for tho&s;e that he is &s;atisfied are really born again of God.&mdash;Ap|ply this to our Lord's ca&s;e, as a faint illu&s;tration of it&mdash;Con&s;ider what has been &s;aid upon the young man's ca&s;e in general, and then, if before you were fond of this objection, in&s;tead of triumphing with him, you will go &s;orrowful away.&mdash;Our Saviour's reply to him, more and more convinces us of the truth of the prophet's a&s;&s;ertion in the text, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>the Lord is our righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But there is a fourth and grand objection yet be|hind, and that is taken from the 25th chapter of St. Matthew, <Q>where our Lord is de&s;cribed, as re|warding people with eternal life, becau&s;e they fed the hungry, clothed the naked, and &s;uch like.&mdash;Their works therefore were a cau&s;e of their ju&s;tification; con&s;equently, the doctrine of im|puted righteou&s;ne&s;s is not agreeable to &s;cripture.</Q></P>
<P>This I confe&s;s is the mo&s;t plau&s;ible objection that is brought again&s;t the doctrine in&s;i&s;ted on from the text. And in order that we may an&s;wer it in as clear and brief a manner as may be, we confe&s;s with the article of the church of England, <Q>that albeit good works do not ju&s;tify us, yet they will follow after ju&s;tification, as fruits of it; and tho' they can claim no reward in them&s;elves, yet for|a&s;much as they &s;pring from faith in Chri&s;t, and a renewed &s;oul, they &s;hall receive a reward <HI>of grace,</HI> though not <HI>of debt;</HI> and con&s;equently, the more we abound in &s;uch good works, the greater will be our reward when Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall come to judgment.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="029886_0020_0FE2BF09F8A78E28">
Take the&s;e con&s;iderations along with us, and they will help us much to an&s;wer the objection now before us.&mdash;For thus St. Matthew&mdash;<HI>Then &s;hall the King &s;ay to them on the right hand, Come ye ble&s;&s;ed children of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.&mdash;For I was an hungry, and ye gave me meat. I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me drink. I was a &s;tranger, and ye took me in. Naked, and ye clothed me. I was &s;ick, and ye vi&s;ited me I was in pri&s;on, and ye came unto me.</HI> <Q>I will therefore reward you, becau&s;e you have done the&s;e things out of love to me, and hereby have evidenced your&s;elves to be my true di&s;ci|ples.</Q>&mdash;And that the people did not depend on the&s;e good actions for their ju&s;tification in the fight of God, is evident. <HI>For when &s;aw we thee an hungry,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>and fed thee? or thir&s;ty, and gave thee drink? When &s;aw we thee a &s;tranger, and took thee in? Or naked, and clothed thee? Or when &s;aw we thee &s;ick, or in pri&s;on, and came unto thee?</HI>&mdash;Lan|guage and que&s;tions quite improper for per&s;ons re|lying on their own righteou&s;ne&s;s for acceptance and acquitance in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>But when they reply again this.&mdash;In the latter part of the chapter, &s;ay they, It is plain that Je&s;us Chri&s;t rejects and damns the others for not doing the&s;e things. And therefore if he damns tho&s;e for not doing, he &s;aves tho&s;e for doing; and con&s;e|quently the doctrine of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s is good for nothing.</P>
<P>But that is no con&s;equence at all&mdash;For God may ju&s;tly damn any man for omitting the lea&s;t duty of the moral law, and yet in him&s;elf is not obliged to give any one any reward, &s;uppo&s;ing he has done all that he can. We are unprofitable &s;ervants, we have done not near &s;o much as it was our duty to

do, mu&s;t be the language of the mo&s;t holy &s;ouls living; and therefore from, or in our&s;elves, cannot be ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God.&mdash;This was the frame of the devout &s;ouls ju&s;t now referred to&mdash;Sen&s;ible of this, they were &s;o far from depending on their works for ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God, that they were filled, as it were, with a holy blu&s;h|ing, to think our Lord &s;hould conde&s;cend to men|tion, much more to reward them for their poor works of faith and labours of love. I am per&s;uad|ed their hearts would ri&s;e with a holy indignation again&s;t tho&s;e, who urge this pa&s;&s;age as an objection again&s;t the a&s;&s;ertion of the prophet in the words of the text, that the <HI>Lord is our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I think we have fairly an&s;wered the&s;e grand objections, which are generally urged again&s;t the doctrine of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;Was I to &s;top here, I think I might &s;ay, we are made more than conquerors, through him that loved us.&mdash;But there is a way of arguing which I have always admired, becau&s;e I have thought always very con|vincing, <HI>viz.</HI> by &s;hewing the ab&s;urdities that will follow from denying any particular propo&s;ition in di&s;pute.</P>
<P>This is the next thing that was propo&s;ed,&mdash;<Q>And n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ver did greater or more ab&s;urdities flow from the denying any doctrine, than will flow from denying the doctrine of Chri&s;t's imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>And fir&s;t, if we deny this doctrine, we turn the truth, I mean the word of God, as much as we can into a lie, and utterly &s;ubvert all tho&s;e places of &s;cripture, which &s;ay, <HI>That we are &s;aved by grace; that it is not of works, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t any man &s;hould boa&s;t.</HI>&mdash;That &s;alvation is God's free gift&mdash;and that, <HI>He that glorieth, mu&s;t glory in the Lord.</HI>&mdash;For, if the whole

Let it &s;uffice to affirm in the general, that if we deny an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, we may as well deny a divine revelation all at once. For it is the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end of the book of God.&mdash;We mu&s;t either di&s;believe that, or believe what the prophet hath &s;poken in the text, <HI>That the Lord is our righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But farther.&mdash;I ob&s;erved at the beginning of this di&s;cour&s;e, that we are all Arminians and Pa|pi&s;ts by nature;&mdash;for, as one ob&s;erves, Arminian|i&s;m is the back way to Popery.

<P>Suppo&s;e I went a little more round about, and told you, that the death of Chri&s;t was not &s;uffici|ent, without our death being added to it; that you mu&s;t die as well as Chri&s;t, join your death with his, and then it would be &s;ufficient.&mdash;Might you not then, with a holy indignation, throw du&s;t in the air, and ju&s;tly call me a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">etter forth of &s;trange doctrines?

<P>WHEN I read to you the&s;e words, I may ad|dre&s;s you in the language of the holy an|gels to the &s;hepherds, that were watching their flocks by night. <HI>Behold I bring you glad tidings of great joy.</HI>&mdash;For this is the fir&s;t promi&s;e that was made of a Saviour&punc; to the apo&s;tate race of Adam. We generally look for Chri&s;t only in the New Te&s;tament; but Chri&s;tianity, in one &s;en&s;e, is very near as old as the creation.&mdash;It is wonderful to ob&s;erve, how gradually God revealed his Son to mankind. He began with the promi&s;e in the text, and this the elect lived upon till the time of Abraham&mdash;To him God made further di&s;coveries of his eternal coun&s;el concerning man's redemp|tion.&mdash;Afterwards, at &s;undry times, and in divers manners, God &s;pake to the fathers by the prophets, till at length the Lord Je&s;us him&s;elf was manife&s;t|ed in the fle&s;h, and came and tabernacled among us.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t promi&s;e mu&s;t certainly be but dark to our fir&s;t parents, in compari&s;on of that &s;ight we enjoy.&mdash;And yet, dark as it was, we may a&s;&s;ure

our&s;elves they built upon it their hopes of everla&s;t|ing &s;alvation, and by that faith were &s;aved.</P>
<P>How they came to &s;tand in need of this prom|i&s;e, and what is the extent and meaning of it, I intend God willing, to make the &s;ubject matter of your pre&s;ent meditation.</P>
<P>The fall of man is written in too legible cha|racters not to be under&s;tood&mdash;Tho&s;e that deny it, by their denying prove it. The very heathens confe&s;&s;ed and bewailed it.&mdash;They could &s;ee the &s;treams of corruption running through the whole race of mankind, but could not trace them to the fountain head. Before God gave a revelation of his Son, man was a riddl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to him&s;elf&mdash;And Mo&s;es unfolds more in this one chapter (out of which the text is taken) than all mankind could have been capable of finding out of them&s;elves, though they had &s;tudied to all eternity.</P>
<P>In the foregoing chapter, he had given us a full account, how God &s;poke the world into being; and e&s;pecially how he formed man of the du&s;t of the earth, and breathed into him the breath of life, &s;o that he became a living &s;oul. A coun&s;el of the Trinity was called concerning the formati|on of this lovely creature. The re&s;ult of that council was, <HI>Let us make man in our image after our likene&s;s.&mdash;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him.</HI>&mdash;Mo&s;es remark|ably repeats the words, that we might take par|ticular notice of our divine original.&mdash;Never was &s;o much expre&s;&s;ed in &s;o few words.&mdash;None but a man in&s;pired could have done &s;o. But it is re|markable, that though Mo&s;es mentions our being made in the image of God, yet he mentions it but twice, and that, as it were, in a tran&s;ient man|ner, as though he would have &s;aid, "Man was
<PB N="39" REF="029886_0035_0FE2BF4111804150">
made in honour, God made him upright, <HI>in the image of God male and female created he them.</HI> But man &s;o &s;oon fell, and became like the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h, nay; like the devil him&s;elf, that it is &s;carce worth mentioning."</P>
<P>How &s;oon man fell after he was created, is not told us, and&punc; therefore, to fix any time, is to be wi&s;e above what is written.&mdash;And, I think, they who-&s;uppo&s;e that man fell the &s;ame day in which he was made, have no &s;ufficient ground for their opinion.&mdash;The many things which are crouded to|gether in the former chapter, &s;uch as the formation of Adam's wife, his giving names to the bea&s;ts, and his being put into the garden which God had planted, I think require a longer &s;pace of time than a day to be tran&s;acted in&mdash;However, all agree in this, "Man &s;tood not long." How long, or how &s;hort a while, I will not take upon me to de|termine.&mdash;It more concerns us to enquire, how he came to fall from his &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s, and what was the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the temptation which pre|vailed over him.&mdash;The account given us in this chapter concerning it, is very full, and it may do us much &s;ervice under God, to make &s;ome re|marks upon it.</P>
<P><HI>Now the &s;erpent,</HI> &s;ays the &s;acred hi&s;torian, <HI>was more &s;ubtile than any bea&s;t of the field which the Lord God had made, and he &s;aid unto the woman, yea, hath God &s;aid, ye &s;hall not eat of every tree of the garden.</HI></P>
<P>Though this was a real &s;erpent, yet he that &s;poke was no other than the devil; from hence, perhaps, called the old &s;erpent, becau&s;e he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;erpent when he came to beguile our fir&s;t parents.&mdash;The devil envied the happine&s;s of man, who was made, as &s;ome think, to &s;upply the place of fallen angels.&mdash;God made man upright, and

Here &s;he begins to warp, and &s;in begins to con|ceive in her heart.&mdash;Already &s;he has contracted &s;ome of the &s;erpent's poi&s;on, by talking with him, which &s;he ought not to have done at all. For we might ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, that it could be no good be|ing, that could put &s;uch a que&s;tion unto her, and infinuate &s;uch di&s;honourable thoughts of God.&mdash;She &s;hould therefore have fled from him, and not &s;tood to have parleyed with him at all.&mdash;Immedi|ately the ill effects of it appear&mdash;&s;he begins to &s;of|ten the divine threatening.&mdash;God hath &s;aid, the <HI>Day thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;halt &s;urely die;</HI> or, <HI>dy|ing thou &s;halt die.</HI>&mdash;But Eve &s;ays, ye &s;hall not eat of it, neither &s;hall ye touch it le&s;t ye die.&mdash;We may be a&s;&s;ured we are fallen into, and begin to fill by temptation, when we begin to think God

will not be &s;o good as his word, in re&s;pect to the execution of his threatnings denounced again&s;t &s;in.&mdash;Satan knew this, and therefore artfully &s;aid unto the woman, ver. 4. <HI>Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die,</HI> in an in&s;inuating manner, "Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die&mdash;&s;urely, God will not be &s;o cruel as to damn you only for eating an apple, it cannot be."&mdash;Alas! how many does Satan lead captive at his will, by flattering them that they &s;hall not &s;urely die, that hell torments will not be eternal&mdash;that God is all mercy; that he therefore will not puni&s;h a few years &s;in with an eternity of mi&s;ery.&mdash;But Eve found God as good as his word, and &s;o will all they that go on in &s;in, under a fal&s;e hope that they &s;hall not &s;urely die.</P>
<P>We may al&s;o under&s;tand the words &s;poken po&s;itively, and this is agreeable to what follows&mdash;<HI>You &s;hall not &s;urely die</HI>&mdash;"It is all a delu&s;ion, a mere mere bugbear, to keep you in a &s;ervile &s;ubjection."</P>
<P>For, ver. 4. <HI>God doth know, that in the day ye eat thereof, then &s;hall your eyes be opened, and ye &s;hall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</HI></P>
<P>What child of God can expect to e&s;cape &s;lan|der, when God him&s;elf was thus &s;landered even in paradi&s;e? Surely the under&s;tanding of Eve mu&s;t have been, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, blinded, or &s;he would not have &s;uffered the tempter to &s;peak &s;uch perver&s;e things.&mdash;In what odious colours is God here repre&s;ented! <HI>God doth know, that in the day ye eat thereof, ye &s;hall be as gods</HI> (equal with God.) So that the grand temptation was, that they &s;hould be hereafter under no controul, equal, if not &s;upe|rior to God, that made them, knowing good and evil.&mdash;Eve could not t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll what Satan meant by this; but, to be &s;ure, &s;he under&s;tood it of &s;ome great privilege which they were to enjoy.&mdash;And

<P>To give &s;trength and force to this temptation, in all probability, Satan, or the &s;erpent, at this time, plucked an apple from the tree, and ate it before Eve, by which Eve might be induced to think, that the &s;agacity and power of &s;peech, which the &s;erpent had above the other bea&s;ts, mu&s;t be owing, in a great mea&s;ure, to his eating that fruit; and, therefore, if he received &s;o much improvement, &s;he might al&s;o expect a like bene|fit from it.

It is a matter of great importance&mdash;For want of knowing this, people have been &s;o long mi&s;led&mdash;They have been taught that they mu&s;t do &s;o and &s;o, as though they were under a covenant of works, and then for DOING this, they &s;hould be &s;aved.&mdash;This is plainly the whole drift of the book wrong|ly intitled, <HI>The Whole Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of Man</HI>&mdash;Whereas, on the contrary, people &s;hould be taught, that the Lord Je&s;us was the &s;econd Adam, with whom the Father entered into covenant for fallen man&mdash;That they can now do nothing of or for them|&s;elves, and &s;hould therefore come to God, be|&s;eeching him to give them faith, by which they &s;hall be enabled to lay hold on the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and that faith they will &s;hew forth by their works, out of love and gratitude to the ever ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, their mo&s;t glorious Redeemer, for what he has done for their &s;ouls: this is a con|&s;i&s;tent &s;criptural &s;cheme; without holding this, we mu&s;t run into one of the&s;e two bad extremes, I mean Antinomiani&s;m on the one hand, or Armin|iani&s;m on the other&mdash;From both which may the good Lord deliver us!&mdash;</P>
<P>But to proceed: By the <HI>&s;eed of the woman,</HI> we are here to under&s;tand the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who, though very God of very God, was for us men and our &s;alvation, to have a body prepared for him by the Holy Gho&s;t, and to be born of a woman, who never knew man, and by his obedience and death, make an atonement for man's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and bring in an everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, work in them a new nature, and thereby brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head, <HI>i. e.</HI> de&s;troy his power and dominion over

<P>It is not to be doubted but Adam and Eve un|der&s;tood this promi&s;e in this &s;en&s;e; for its plain, in the latter part of the chapter, &s;acrifices were in&s;tituted&mdash;For, from whence &s;hould tho&s;e &s;kins come, but from bea&s;ts &s;lain for &s;acrifice, of which God made them coats?&mdash;We find al&s;o Abel, as well as Cain, offering &s;acrifice in the next chap|ter: and the apo&s;tle tells us, he did it <HI>by faith,</HI> no doubt in this promi&s;e&mdash;And Eve, when Cain was born, &s;aid, <HI>I have gotten a man from the</HI> LORD, or (as Mr. Henry ob&s;erves) it may be rendered, <HI>I have gotten a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> man</HI>&mdash;THE LORD&mdash;the promi&s;ed M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;iah.&mdash;Some further &s;uppo&s;e, that Eve was the fir&s;t believer, and therefore they tran&s;late it thus; the <HI>&s;eed,</HI> not of THEE, but of THIS <HI>woman,</HI> which magnifies the grace of God &s;o much the more, that &s;he, who was fir&s;t in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, &s;hould be the fir&s;t partaker of redemption&mdash;Adam be|lieved al&s;o, and was &s;aved&mdash;For, unto Adam and his wife, did the Lord God make coats of &s;kins, and cloathed THEM, which was a remarkable type of their being cloathed with the righteou&s;ne&s;s of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>This promi&s;e was literally fulfilled in the per&s;on of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash;Satan brui&s;ed his heel, when he tempted him for forty days together in the wilderne&s;s&mdash;He brui&s;ed his heel, when he rai&s;ed up &s;trong per&s;ecution again&s;t him, during the time of his public mini&s;try&mdash;He, in an e&s;pe|cial manner, brui&s;ed his heel, when our Lord complained that his <HI>&s;oul was exce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing &s;orrowful,

even unto death, and he &s;weat great drops of blood falling upon the ground,</HI> when praying in the garden. He brui&s;ed his heel, when he put it into the heart of Judas to betray him:&mdash;And he brui&s;ed him yet mo&s;t of all, when his emi&s;&s;aries nailed him to an accur&s;ed tree, and our Lord cried out, <HI>My God, my God! Why&punc; ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me?</HI>&mdash;Yet, in all this, the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, the &s;eed of the wo|man, brui&s;ed his accur&s;ed head&mdash;For, in that he was tempted, he was able to <HI>&s;uccour tho&s;e that are tempted.</HI> By <HI>his &s;tripes we are healed.</HI> The cha&s;|ti&s;ement of our peace was upon him. By dying, he de&s;troyed him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.&mdash;He thereby &s;poiled principali|ties and powers, and made a &s;hew of them openly, triumphing over them upon the cro&s;s.&mdash;</P>
<P>This promi&s;e has been, is, and will be fulfilled in the elect of God con&s;idered collectively, as well before as after the coming of our Lord in the fle&s;h&mdash;For they may be called <HI>the &s;eed of the woman.</HI> Marvel not, that <HI>all that will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us mu&s;t &s;uffer per&s;ecution.</HI>&mdash;In this promi&s;e there is an eternal enmity put between the &s;eed of the woman, and the &s;eed of the &s;erpent. So that tho&s;e that are born after the fle&s;h, cannot but per|&s;ecute tho&s;e that are born after the Spirit. This enmity &s;hewed it&s;elf &s;oon after this promi&s;e was revealed, in Cain's brui&s;ing the heel of Abel&punc; It continued in the church through all the ages be|fore Chri&s;t came in the fle&s;h, as the hi&s;tory of the Bible, and the 11th chapter of the Hebrews plain|ly &s;hew&mdash;It raged exceedingly after our Lord's a&s;cen&s;ion, witne&s;s the acts of the apo&s;tles, and the hi&s;tory of the primitive Chri&s;tians.&mdash;It now rages, and will continue to rage, and &s;hew it&s;elf, in a greater or le&s;s degree, to the end of time. But let

not this di&s;may us! For, in all this, the &s;eed of the woman is more than conqueror, and brui&s;es the &s;erpent's head&mdash;Thus the I&s;raelites, the more they were oppre&s;&s;ed, the more they encrea&s;ed.&mdash;Thus it was with the apo&s;tles&mdash;Thus it was with their immediate followers. So that Tertullian compares the church in his time to a mowed field, the more frequently it is cut, the more it grows. The blood of the martyrs was always the &s;eed of the church. And I have often &s;at down with wonder and delight, and admire how God has made the very &s;chemes, which his enemies con|trived in order to hinder, the mo&s;t effectual means to propagate his go&s;pel&mdash;The devil has had &s;o lit|tle &s;ucce&s;s in per&s;ecution, that if I did not know, that he and his children, according to this ver&s;e&punc; could not but per&s;ecute, I &s;hould think he would count it his &s;trength to &s;it &s;till. What did he get by per&s;ecuting the martyrs in queen Mary's time? Was not the grace of God exceedingly glorified in their &s;upport? What did he get by per&s;ecuting the good old Puritans? Did it not prove the peo|pling, of New England?&mdash;Or to come nearer to our own times, What hath he got by putting us out of the &s;ynagogues? Hath not the word of God, &s;ince that, mightily prevailed? My dear hearers, you mu&s;t excu&s;e me for enlarging on this head. God fills my &s;oul generally, when I come to this topic. I can &s;ay with Luther, "If it were not for per&s;ecution, I &s;hould not under&s;tand the &s;cripture." If Satan &s;hould be yet &s;uffered to brui&s;e my heel further, and his &s;ervants &s;hould thru&s;t me into pri&s;on, I doubt not, but even that would only tend to the more effectual brui&s;ing of his head. I remember a &s;aying of the then lord Chancellor to the pious Bradford: "Thou ha&s;t
<PB N="58" REF="029886_0054_0FE2BEDD97339728">

<P>Further: This promi&s;e is al&s;o fulfilled, not only in the church in general, but in every individual believer in particular&mdash;In every believer there are two &s;eeds, the &s;eed of the woman, and the &s;eed of the &s;erpent&mdash;The fle&s;h lu&s;ting again&s;t the Spirit, and the Spirit again&s;t the fle&s;h&mdash;It is with the be|liever, when quickened with grace in his heart, as it was with Rebeccah, when &s;he had conceived E&s;au and Jacob in her womb!

<P>WHEN our Lord Je&s;us was plea&s;ed to take upon him&s;elf the form of a &s;er|vant, and go about preaching the kingdom of God, he took all opportunities in public, and more e&s;pecially in private, to caution his di&s;ciples again&s;t &s;eeking great things for them&s;elves; and al&s;o to forwarn them of the many di&s;tre&s;&s;es, afflictions, and per&s;ecutions which they mu&s;t expect to en|dure and go through for his name's &s;ake. The great St. Paul, therefore, the author of this epi&s;|tle, in this, as in all other things, following the &s;teps of his ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, takes particular care, among other apo&s;tolical admonitions, to warn young Timothy of the difficulties he mu&s;t expect to meet with in the cour&s;e of his mini&s;try&punc; "This know al&s;o," (&s;ays he, ver&s;e fir&s;t of this chapter) "that in the la&s;t days perilous times &s;hall come.

And then, to encourage Tim|othy yet the more, he propounds to him his own example: "But thou ha&s;t fully known my doc|trine, manner of life, purpo&s;e, faith, long-&s;uffering, charity, patience, per&s;ecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Ly&s;tra; what per&s;ecutions I endured; But out of them all the Lord delivered me."

<ITEM>II. The different kinds of per&s;ecution to which they, who live godly, are expo&s;ed.</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> We &s;hall apply the whole.</P>
<P>And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> Let us con&s;ider what it is to live god|ly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: this &s;uppo&s;es, that we are made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in Chri&s;t, that we are born again, and are made one with Chri&s;t by a living faith, and a vital union even as Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the Father are one. Unle&s;s we are thus con|verted, and transformed by the renewing of our minds, we cannot properly be &s;aid to be in Chri&s;t, much le&s;s to live godly in him. To be in Chri&s;t merely by bapti&s;m, and an outward profe&s;&s;ion; is not to be in him in the &s;trict &s;en&s;e of the word: No; they that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, are new crea|tures; old things are pa&s;&s;ed away, and all things are become new in their hearts. Their life is hid with Chri&s;t in God; their &s;ouls daily feed on the invi&s;ible realities of another world. To live godly in Chri&s;t, is to make the divine will, and not our own, the &s;ole principle of all our thoughts, words and actions; &s;o that, whether we eat or drink, or what&s;oever we do, we do all to the glory of God. Tho&s;e who live godly in Chri&s;t, may not &s;o much be &s;aid to live, as Chri&s;t to live in them: he is their alpha and omega, their fir&s;t and la&s;t, their beginning and end. They are led by his Spirit, as a child is led by the hand of its Father; and are willing to follow the Lamb whither&s;oever he leads them. They hear, know, and obey his voice.&mdash;Their affections are &s;et on things above. Their

hopes are full of immortality; their citizen&s;hip is in heaven. Being born again of God, they habit|ually live to, and daily walk with God. They are pure in heart; and, from a principle of faith in Chri&s;t, are holy in all manner of conver&s;ation and godline&s;s.</P>
<P>This is to live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: and hence we may ea&s;ily learn, why &s;o few &s;uffer per&s;ecution? becau&s;e &s;o few live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. You may attend on outward duties; you may live morally in Chri&s;t, <HI>i. e.</HI> you may do (as they term it) no one any harm, and avoid per&s;ecution: but they that will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, mu&s;t &s;uffer per&s;ecution.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> What is the meaning of the word <HI>per|&s;ecution,</HI> and how many kinds there are of it, I come now to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>The word <HI>per&s;ecution</HI> is derived from a Greek word &s;ignifying to <HI>pur&s;ue,</HI> and generally implies, "pur&s;uing a per&s;on for the &s;ake of his goodne&s;s, or God's good will to him." The fir&s;t kind of it, is that of the heart. We have an early exam|ple of this in that wicked one Cain, who, becau&s;e the Lord had re&s;pect to Abel and his offering, and not to him and his offering, was very wroth, his countenance fell, and at length he cruelly &s;lew his envied brother. Thus the Phari&s;ees hated and per&s;ecuted our Lord long before they laid hold on him: and our Lord mentions being inwardly ha|ted of men, as one kind of per&s;ecution his di&s;ci|ples were to undergo. This heart-enmity (if I may &s;o term it) is the root of all other kinds of per&s;ecution, and is in &s;ome degree or other, to be found in the &s;oul of every&punc; unregenerated man; and numbers are guilty of this per&s;ecution, who never have it in their power to per&s;ecute any oth|er
<PB N="65" REF="029886_0061_0FE2C02C574AD078">
way. Nay, numbers would be carried out ac|tually to put in practice all other degrees of per|&s;ecution, was not the name of per&s;ecution become odious among mankind, and did they not hereby run the hazard of lo&s;ing their reputation. Alas! how many at the great day, whom we know not now, will be convicted and condemned, that all their life harboured a &s;ecret evil will again&s;t Zion! They may now &s;creen it before men; but God &s;eeth the enmity of their hearts, and will judge them as per&s;ecutors at the great and terrible day of judgment!</P>
<P>A &s;econd degree of per&s;ecution is that of the tongue; out of the abundance of the heart the mouth &s;peaketh. Many I &s;uppo&s;e think it no harm to &s;hoot out arrows, even bitter words, a|gain&s;t the di&s;ciples of the Lord: they &s;catter the fire-brands, arrows, and death, &s;aying, "Are we not in &s;port?" But, however they may e&s;teem it, in God's account evil-&s;peaking is a high degree of per&s;ecution. Thus I&s;hmael's mocking I&s;aac in the Old, is termed per&s;ecuting him in the New Te&s;tament. Ble&s;&s;ed are ye, &s;ays our Lord, when men &s;hall revile you, and per&s;ecute you, and &s;hall &s;ay all manner of evil again&s;t you fal&s;ely for my name's &s;ake. From whence we may gather, that reviling and &s;peaking all manner of evil fal&s;ely for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, is a high degree of per&s;ecution. For a good name, &s;ays the wi&s;e man, is better than precious ointment, and to many is dearer than life it&s;elf. It is a great breach of the &s;ixth command|ment to &s;lander any one; but to &s;peak evil of and &s;lander the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, merely becau&s;e they are his di&s;ciples, mu&s;t be highly provoking in the &s;ight of God; and &s;uch who are guilty of it (with|out
<PB N="66" REF="029886_0062_0FE2BF9B4A7BC6E0">
repentance) will find that Je&s;us Chri&s;t will call them to an account, and puni&s;h them for all their ungodly and hard &s;peeches in a lake of fire and brim&s;tone. This &s;hall be their portion to drink.</P>
<P>The third and la&s;t kind of per&s;ecution, is that which expre&s;&s;es it&s;elf in actions; as when wicked men &s;eparate the children of God from their com|pany; <HI>ble&s;&s;ed are ye,</HI> &s;ays our Lord, <HI>when they &s;hall &s;eparate you from their company:</HI> or expo&s;e them to church-cen&s;ures. <HI>They &s;hall put you out of their &s;ynagogues;</HI> threatening and prohibiting them from making an open profe&s;&s;ion of his religion or wor&s;hip; or interdicting mini&s;ters for preaching his word, as the high prie&s;ts threatened the apo&s;|tles, and forbad them <HI>any more to &s;peak in the name of Je&s;us;</HI> and <HI>Paul breathed out threatenings and &s;laughter again&s;t the di&s;ciples of the Lord:</HI> Or when they call them into courts; <HI>you &s;hall be called before governors,</HI> &s;ays our Lord: Or when they fine, im|pri&s;on, or puni&s;h them, by confi&s;cation of goods, cruel &s;courging, and, la&s;tly, death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible to enumerate in what various &s;hapes per&s;ecution as appeared. It is a many-headed mon&s;ter, in&s;atiable as hell, cruel as the grave; and, what is wor&s;e, it generally ap|pears under the cloak of religion. But cruel, in|&s;atiable, and horrid as it is, they that live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, mu&s;t expect to &s;uffer and encounter with it in all its forms.</P>
<P>This is what we are to make good under our next general head.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Why is it that godly men mu&s;t expect to &s;uffer per&s;ecution? And,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> This appears from the whole ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ur of our Lord's doctrine. We will begin with his di|vine
<PB N="67" REF="029886_0063_0FE2C031D8018200">
&s;ermon on the Mount. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>are they who are per&s;ecuted for righteou&s;ne&s;s' &s;ake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</HI> So that, if our Lord &s;poke truth, we are not &s;o ble&s;&s;ed as to have an intere&s;t in the kingdom of heaven, unle&s;s we are or have been <HI>per&s;ecuted for righteou&s;ne&s;s' &s;ake.</HI> Nay, our Lord (it is remarkable) employs three ver&s;es in this beatitude, and only one in each of the oth|ers; not only to &s;hew that it was a thing which men (as men) are unwilling to believe, but al&s;o the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of it upon our being Chri&s;tians. This is likewi&s;e evident from all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, wherein our Lord informs us, that he came upon the earth, not to &s;end peace but a &s;word; and that the father-in-law &s;hall be again&s;t the mother-in-law, and that a man's foes &s;hall be tho&s;e of his hou&s;ehold. Pa&s;&s;ages, which, though confined by fal&s;e prophets to the fir&s;t, I am per|&s;uaded will be verified by the experience of all true Chri&s;tians in this, and every age of the church. It would be endle&s;s to recount all the places where|in our Lord forewarns his di&s;ciples that they &s;hould be called before rulers, and thru&s;t out of &s;yna|gogues, nay, that the time would come, wherein men &s;hould think they did God &s;ervice to kill them. For this rea&s;on he &s;o frequently declared, that unle&s;s a man <HI>for&s;ake all that he had, and even hated life it&s;elf, he could not be his di&s;ciple.</HI> And therefore it is worthy our ob&s;ervation, that in that remarkable pa&s;&s;age, wherein our Lord makes &s;uch an exten&s;ive promi&s;e to tho&s;e who <HI>left all for him,</HI> he cautiou&s;ly in&s;erts per&s;ecution. <HI>And Je&s;us an|&s;wered and &s;aid, Verily I &s;ay unto you, there i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> man that hath left hou&s;e, or brethren, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, or fa|ther, or mother, or wife, or children, or land, for my &s;ake and the go&s;pel's, but he &s;hall receive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hundred

<P>As this is proved from our Lord's doctrine, &s;o it is no le&s;s evident from his life. Follow him from the manger to the cro&s;s, and &s;ee whether any per&s;ecution was like that which the Son of God the Lord of glory, underwent whil&s;t here on earth. How was he hated by wicked men? How often would that hatred have excited them to take hold of him, had it not been for fear of the people? How was he reviled, counted and called a bla&s;|phemer, a wine bibber, a Samaritan, nay, a devil, and, in one word, had all manner of evil &s;poken again&s;t him fal&s;ely? What contradiction of &s;in|ners did he endure again&s;t him&s;elf? How did men &s;eparate from his company, and were a&s;hamed to walk with him openly? In&s;omuch that he once &s;aid to his own di&s;ciples, <HI>Will you al&s;o go away?</HI> Again, how was he &s;toned, thru&s;t out of the &s;yn|agogues, arraigned as a deceiver of the people, a &s;editious and pe&s;tilent fellow, an enemy to Ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ar, and as &s;uch &s;courged, blindfolded, &s;pit upon, and at length condemned, and nailed to an accur&s;ed tree? Thus was the Ma&s;ter per&s;ecuted; thus did the Lord &s;uffer; and the &s;ervant is not above his ma&s;ter, nor the di&s;ciple above his Lord: <HI>If they have per&s;ecuted me, they will al&s;o per&s;ecute you,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aith the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us.

For all the&s;e things our
<PB N="69" REF="029886_0065_0FE2C0372B088678">
Lord has &s;et us an example, that we &s;hould fol|low his &s;teps: and therefore, God forbid that any who would live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hould henceforward expect to e&s;cape &s;uffering per&s;ecu|tion.</P>
<P>But farther: Not only our Lord's example, but the example of all the &s;aints that ever lived, evi|dently demon&s;trates the truth of the apo&s;tle's a&s;|&s;ertion in the text. How &s;oon was Abel made a martyr for his religion? How was I&s;aac mocked by the &s;on of the bond-woman! And what a large catalogue of &s;uffering Old Te&s;tament &s;aints, have we recorded in the eleventh chapter of the He|brews! Read the Acts of the apo&s;tles, and &s;ee how the Chri&s;tians were threatened, &s;toned, im|pri&s;oned, &s;courged, and per&s;ecuted even unto death. Examine church-hi&s;tory in after-ages, and you will find the murder of the innocents by He|rod, was but an earne&s;t of the innocent blood which &s;hould be &s;hed for the name of Je&s;us. Ex|amine the experience of &s;aints now living on earth; and if it were po&s;&s;ible to con&s;ult the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, I am per&s;uaded each would concur with the apo&s;tle in a&s;&s;erting, that <HI>all who will live godly-in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hall &s;uffer per&s;ecution.</HI></P>
<P>How can it be otherwi&s;e in the very nature of things? Ever &s;ince the fall, there has been an ir|reconcileable enmity between the feed of the wo|man and the &s;eed of the &s;erpent. Wicked men hate God, and therefore, cannot but hate tho&s;e who are like him: they hate to be reformed, and therefore mu&s;t hate and per&s;ecute tho&s;e who, by a contrary behaviour, te&s;tify of them, that their deeds are evil. Be&s;ides, pride of heart leads men to per&s;ecute the &s;ervants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. If they commend them, they are afraid of being a&s;ked,
<PB N="70" REF="029886_0066_0FE2BFA7971341D0">
"Why do you not follow them?" And therefore becau&s;e they dare not imitate, though they may &s;ometimes be even forced to approve their way, yet pride and envy make them turn per&s;ecutors. Hence it is, that as it was formerly, &s;o it is now, and &s;o will it be to the end of time; he that is born after the fle&s;h, the natural man, does and will per&s;ecute him that is born after the Spirit, the regenerate man. Becau&s;e Chri&s;tians are not of the world, but Chri&s;t hath cho&s;en them out of the world, therefore the world will hate them. If it be objected again&s;t this doctrine, "that we now live in a Chri&s;tian world, and therefore mu&s;t not expect &s;uch per&s;ecution as formerly;" I an&s;wer, "All are not Chri&s;tians that are called &s;o; and, till the heart is changed, the enmity again&s;t God (which is the root of all per&s;ecution) remains," and con&s;equently Chri&s;tians, fal&s;ely &s;o called, will per&s;ecute as well as others. I ob&s;erved therefore, in the beginning of this di&s;cour&s;e, that Paul men|tions tho&s;e that had a form of religion, as per&s;ons of whom Timothy had need be chiefly aware: for, as our Lord and his apo&s;tles were mo&s;tly per&s;ecu|ted by their countrymen the Jews, &s;o we mu&s;t ex|pect the like u&s;age from the formali&s;ts of our own nation, the Phari&s;ees, who &s;eem to be religious. For the mo&s;t horrid and barbarous per&s;ecutions have been carried on by tho&s;e who have called them&s;elves Chri&s;tians; witne&s;s the days of queen Mary; and the fines, bani&s;hments, and impri&s;on|ments of the children of God in the la&s;t century, and the bitter irreconcileable hatred that appears in thou&s;ands who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, even in the pre&s;ent days wherein we live.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons who argue again&s;t per&s;ecution now, are not &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of the bitter enmity of the
<PB N="71" REF="029886_0067_0FE2C03DD9686CD0">
heart of every unregenerate man again&s;t God. For my own part, I am &s;o far from wondering that Chri&s;tians are per&s;ecuted, that I wonder our &s;treets do not run with the blood of the &s;aints: was men's power equal to their wills, &s;uch a horrid &s;pectacle would &s;oon appear. But,</P>
<P>Per&s;ecution is nece&s;&s;ary in re&s;pect to the godly them&s;elves. If we have not all manner of evil &s;po|ken of us, how can we know whether we love contempt, and &s;eek only that honour which com|eth from above? If we have not per&s;ecutors, how can our pa&s;&s;ive graces be kept in exerci&s;e? How can many Chri&s;tian precepts be put into practice? How can we love, pray for, and do good to tho&s;e who de&s;pitefully u&s;e us? How can we overcome evil with good? In &s;hort, how can we know we love God better than life it&s;elf? St. Paul was &s;en|&s;ible of all this, and therefore &s;o po&s;itively and peremptorily a&s;&s;erts, that all that will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hall &s;uffer per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>Not that I affirm, "All are per&s;ecuted in a like "degree." No: This would be contrary both to &s;cripture and experience. But though all Chri&s;tians are not really called to &s;uffer every kind of per&s;ecution, yet all Chri&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s are liable thereto: and notwith&s;tanding &s;ome may live in more peace|ful times of the church than others, yet all Chri&s;|tians, in all ages, will find by their own experience that, whether they act in a private or public capa|city, they mu&s;t in &s;ome degree or other, &s;uffer per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>Here then I would pau&s;e, and, <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> by way of application, exhort all per&s;ons,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t&punc;</HI> To &s;tand a while and examine them&s;elves. For, by what has been &s;aid, you may gather one mark, whereby you may judge whether you are
<PB N="72" REF="029886_0068_0FE2BFACF1E095D0">
Chri&s;tians or not. Were you ever per&s;ecuted for righteou&s;ne&s;s' &s;ake? If not, you never yet lived godly in Chri&s;t our Lord. Whatever you may &s;ay to the contrary, the in&s;pired apo&s;tle, in the words of the text (the truth of which, I think, I have &s;ufficiently proved) po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts, that "all that will live godly in him, &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l &s;uffer per|&s;ecution." Not that all who are per&s;ecuted are real Chri&s;tians; for many &s;ometimes &s;uffer, and are per&s;ecuted on other accounts than for righte|ou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake. The great que&s;tion therefore is, "Whether you are ever per&s;ecuted for living god|ly?" You may boa&s;t (as perhaps you may think) of your great prudence and &s;agacity, (and indeed the&s;e are excellent things) and glory becau&s;e you have not run &s;uch lengths and made your&s;elves &s;o &s;ingular, and liable to &s;uch contempt, as &s;ome others have. But, alas! this is not a mark of your being a Chri&s;tian, but of a Laodicean &s;pirit, neither hot nor cold, and &s;it only to be &s;pewed out of the mouth of God. That which you call prudence, is often only cowardice, dreadful hypo|cri&s;y, pride of heart, which makes you dread con|tempt, and afraid to give up your reputation for God. You are a&s;hamed of Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel, and in all probability, was he to appear a &s;econd time upon earth, in words as well as works, you would deny him. Awake therefore, all ye that live only formally in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and no longer &s;eek that honour which cometh of man.&mdash;I do not de&s;ire to court you, but I entreat you to live godly, and fear not contempt for the &s;ake of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Beg of God to give you his Holy Spirit, that you may &s;ee through, and di&s;cover the latent hypocri&s;y of your hearts, and no longer deceive your own &s;ouls. Re|member you cannot reconcile two irreconcileable
<PB N="73" REF="029886_0069_0FE2C0429D9C4E98">
differences, God and Mammon, the friend&s;hip of this world, with the favour of God. Know you not who hath told you, that the "friend&s;hip of this world is enmity with God?" If therefore you are in friend&s;hip with the world, notwith&s;tanding all your &s;pecious pretences to piety, you are at en|mity with God: you are only heart-hypocrites, and, "What is the hope of the hypocrite, when God &s;hall take away his &s;oul?" Let the words of the text &s;ound an alarm in your ears&mdash;Oh let them &s;ink deep into your hearts; "yea, and all that will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hall &s;uffer per&s;e|cution."</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> From the words of the text, I would take occa&s;ion to &s;peak to tho&s;e "who are about to li&s;t them&s;elves under the banner of Chri&s;t's cro&s;s." What &s;ay you? Are you re&s;olved to live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, notwith&s;tanding the con&s;equence will be, that you mu&s;t &s;uffer per&s;ecution? You are beginning to build, but have you taken our Lord's advice, to &s;it down fir&s;t and count the co&s;t? Have you well weighed with your&s;elves that weighty de|claration, "he that loveth father or mother more than ME, is not worthy of ME;" and again, "Un|le&s;s a man for&s;ake all that he hath, he cannot be my di&s;ciple?" Perhaps &s;ome of you have great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; will not you go away &s;orrowful, if Chri&s;t &s;hould require you to &s;ell all that you have! Others of you again, may be kin&s;men, or &s;ome way related, or under obligations to the high prie&s;ts, or other great per&s;onages, who may be per&s;ecuting the church of Chri&s;t: what &s;ay you? Will you, with Mo&s;es, rather choo&s;e to "&s;uffer affliction with the people of God, than enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;in for a &s;ea&s;on?" Perhaps you may &s;ay, "My friends will not oppo&s;e me." That is
<PB N="74" REF="029886_0070_0FE2BFB4024CBAD8">
more than you know: in all probability your chief enemies will be tho&s;e of your own hou&s;e|hold. If therefore they &s;hould oppo&s;e you, are you willing naked to follow a naked Chri&s;t? and to wander about in &s;heep-&s;kins, and goat-&s;kins, in dens and caves of the earth, being afflicted, de&s;ti|tute, tormented, rather than not be Chri&s;t's di&s;ci|ples? You are now all following with zeal, as Ruth and Orpah did Naomi, and may weep un|der the word; but are not your tears crocodile's tears? And when difficulties come, will you not go back from following your Lord, as Orpah de|parted from following Naomi; Have you really the root of grace in your hearts? Or, are you on|ly &s;tony-ground hearers? You receive the word with joy; but, when per&s;ecution ari&s;es becau&s;e of of the word, will you not be immediately offen|ded? Be not angry with me for putting the&s;e que&s;tions to you. I am jealous over you, but it is with a godly jealou&s;y; For, alas! how many have put their hands to the plough, and afterwards have &s;hamefully looked back? I only deal with you, as our Lord did with the per&s;on that &s;aid, "Lord I will follow thee whither&s;oever thou wilt. The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have ne&s;ts, but the Son of man, &s;ays he, hath not where to lay his head." What &s;ay you? Are you willing to endure hardne&s;s, and thereby approve your&s;elves good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t! You now come on foot out of the towns and villages to hear the word, and receive me as a me&s;&s;enger of God: But will you not by and by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> out, "Away with him, away with him; it is not fit &s;uch a fellow &s;hould live upon the earth?"

Sit down therefore, I be&s;eech you, and &s;eriou&s;ly count the co&s;t, and a&s;k your|&s;elves again and again, whether you count all things but dung and dro&s;s, and are willing to &s;uffer the lo&s;s of all things, &s;o that you may win Chri&s;t, and be found in him: for you may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elves, the apo&s;tle hath not &s;poken in vain, "All that will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hall &s;uffer per&s;e|cution."</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> The text &s;peaks to you that are pati|ently &s;uffering for the truth's &s;ake: "Rejoice and be exceeding glad; great &s;hall be your reward in heaven." For to you it is given not only to believe, but al&s;o to &s;uffer, and perhaps remarkably too, for the &s;ake of Je&s;us! This is a mark of your di&s;ciple|&s;hip, an evidence that you do live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Fear not therefore, neither be di&s;mayed. Oh, be not weary and &s;aint in your minds! Je&s;us, your Lord, your life, cometh and his reward is with him. Though all men for&s;ake you, yet will not he: No; the Spirit of Chri&s;t and of glory &s;hall re&s;t upon you. In patience therefore, po&s;&s;e&s;s your &s;ouls. Sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. Be in nothing terrified by your adver&s;aries: on their part Chri&s;t is evil &s;poken of; on your part he is glorified. Be not a&s;hamed of your glory, &s;ince others can glory in their &s;hame. Think it not &s;trange concerning the fiery tria<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, wherewith you are or may be tried.

given them from above; God &s;ets them their bounds, which they cannot pa&s;s; and the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; no one &s;hall &s;et upon you to hurt you, without your heavenly Father's knowledge. Do your earthly friends and parents for&s;ake you? Are you ca&s;t out of the &s;ynagogues? The Lord &s;hall reveal him&s;elf to you, as to the man that was born blind. Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall take you up. If they carry you to pri&s;on, and load you with chains, &s;o that the iron enter into your &s;ouls, even there &s;hall Chri&s;t &s;end an angel from heaven to &s;trengthen you, and enable you with Paul and Silas, to &s;ing prai&s;es at midnight. Are you threatened to be thrown into a den of lions, or ca&s;t into a burning fiery furnace, becau&s;e you will not bow down and wor&s;hip the bea&s;t? Fear not; the God whom you &s;erve, is able to deliver you: Or, if he &s;hould &s;uffer the flames to devour your bodies, they would only &s;erve as &s;o many fiery chariots, to carry your &s;ouls to God. Thus it was with the martyrs of old; &s;o that one, when he was burning, cried out, "Come, you Pa|pi&s;ts, if you want a miracle, here, behold one! This bed of flames is to me a bed of down." Thus it was with almo&s;t all that &s;uffered in former times; For Je&s;us, notwith&s;tanding he withdrew his own divinity from him&s;elf, yet has always lifted up the light of his countenance upon the &s;ouls of &s;uffer|ing &s;aints. "Fear not therefore tho&s;e that can kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do: but fear him only, who is able to de&s;troy both body and &s;oul in hell." <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Dare, dare, to live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, though you &s;uffer all manner of per&s;ecution.

<HEAD>ABRAHAM'S OFFERING UP HIS SON ISAAC.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>GENESIS xxii. 12.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And he &s;aid, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him; for now I know that thou feare&s;t God, &s;eeing thou ha&s;t not withheld thy &s;on, thine only &s;on from me.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE great Apo&s;tle Paul, in one of his epi&s;tles, informs us, that <HI>what&s;over was written a|foretime was written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the holy &s;cripture might have hope.</HI> And as without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God, or to be accepted in Je&s;us, the Son of his love; we may be a&s;&s;ured, that whatever in&s;tances of a more than common faith are recorded in the book of God&punc; they were more immediately de&s;ign|ed by the Holy Spirit for our learning and imita|tion, upon whom the ends of the world are come. For this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;on, the author of the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, in the eleventh chapter, mentions a noble catalogue of Old Te&s;tament &s;aints and mar|tyrs, "who &s;ubdued kingdoms, wrought righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, &s;topped the mouths of lions, &amp;c. and are gone before us to inherit the promi&s;es." A &s;uf|ficient confutation, I think, of their error, who lightly e&s;teem the Old Te&s;tament &s;aints, and would not have them mentioned to Chri&s;tians, as per&s;ons who&s;e faith and patience we are called upon more immediately to follow. If this was true, the apo&s;tle would never have produced &s;uch a cloud
<PB N="82" REF="029886_0077_0FE2BFC55B74F9F8">
of witne&s;&s;es out of the Old Te&s;tament, to excite the Chri&s;tians of the fir&s;t, and con&s;equently pure&s;t age of the church, to continue &s;teadfa&s;t and un|moveable in the profe&s;&s;ion of their faith. Amid&s;t this catalogue of &s;aints, methinks, the patriarch Abraham &s;hines the brighte&s;t, and differs from the others, as one &s;tar differeth from another &s;tar in glory; for he &s;hone with &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre, that he was called the <HI>friend of God,</HI> the <HI>father of the faithful;</HI> and tho&s;e who believe on Chri&s;t, are &s;aid to be &s;ons and daughters of, and to be ble&s;&s;ed with, faithful Abraham. Many trials of his faith did God &s;end this great and good man, after he had commanded him to get out from his country, and from his kindred, unto a land which he &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hew him; but the la&s;t was the mo&s;t &s;evere of all, I mean, that of offering up his only &s;on. This, by the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I propo&s;e to make the &s;ubject of your pre&s;ent meditation, and, by way of conclu&s;ion, to draw &s;ome practical inferences, as God &s;hall enable me, from this in&s;tructive &s;tory.</P>
<P>The &s;acred penman begins the narrative thus, ver&s;e 1. <HI>And it came to pa&s;s after the&s;e things, God did tempt Abraham&mdash;After the&s;e things,</HI> that is, after he had underwent many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">evere trials before, after he was old, full of days, and might flatter him&s;elf perhaps that the troubles and toils of life were now fini&s;hed&mdash;<HI>After the&s;e things God did tempt A|braham</HI>&mdash;Chri&s;tian, you know not what trials you may meet with before you die&mdash;Nothwith&s;tanding you may have &s;uffered, and been tried much al|ready, yet, it may be, a greater mea&s;ure is &s;till be|hind, which you are to fill up&mdash;<HI>Be not high-minded, but fear</HI>&mdash;Our la&s;t trials, in all probability, will be the greate&s;t&mdash;And we can never &s;ay our warfare is accompli&s;hed, or our trials fini&s;hed, till we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<P><HI>God did tempt Abraham</HI>&mdash;But can the &s;cripture contradict it&s;elf? Does not St. James tell us, <HI>That God tempts no man?</HI> And God does tempt no man to evil, or on purpo&s;e to draw him into &s;in.

<P>How God was plea&s;ed to reveal his will at this time to his faithful &s;ervant, whether by the She|chinah, or Divine appearance, or by a &s;mall &s;till voice, as he &s;poke to Elijah, or by a whi&s;per, like that of the Spirit to Philip, when he commanded him to join him&s;elf to the Eunuch's chariot, we are not told, nor is it material to inquire. It is enough that we are informed, God &s;aid unto him, Abraham; and that Abraham knew it was the voice of God: for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he &s;aid, behold, here I am." O what a holy familiarity (If I may &s;o &s;peak) is there between God and tho&s;e holy &s;ouls that are
<PB N="84" REF="029886_0079_0FE2BFCD0E0BF668">
united to him by faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us! God &s;ays, Abraham; and Abraham &s;aid (it &s;hould &s;eem without the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;e) "Behold, here I am." Being reconciled to God by the death and obedi|ence of Chri&s;t, which he rejoiced in, and &s;aw by faith afar off; he did not, like guilty Adam, &s;eek the trees of the garden to hide him&s;elf from, but takes plea&s;ure in conver&s;ing with God, and talketh with him, as a man talketh with his friend. O that CHRIST-le&s;s &s;inners knew what it is to have fellow&s;hip with the Father and the Son! They would envy the happine&s;s of &s;aints, and count it all joy to be termed enthu&s;ia&s;ts and fools for Chri&s;t's &s;ake.</P>
<P>But what does God &s;ay unto Abraham; Ver. 2. "Take now thy &s;on, thine only &s;on I&s;aac, whom thou love&s;t, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I &s;hall tell thee of."</P>
<P>Every word de&s;erves our particular ob&s;ervation. Whatever he was to do, he mu&s;t do it now, im|mediately, without conferring with fle&s;h and blood. But what mu&s;t he do? <HI>Take now thy &s;on.</HI> Had God &s;aid, take now a fir&s;tling, or choice&s;t lamb or bea&s;t of thy flock, and offer it up for a burnt-of|fering, it would not have appeared &s;o gha&s;tly; but for God to &s;ay, "Take now thy &s;on, and of|fer him up for a burnt-offering," one would have imagined, was enough to &s;tagger the &s;tronge&s;t faith. But this is not all: It mu&s;t not only be a &s;on, but <HI>thine only &s;on I&s;aac, whom thou love&s;t.</HI> If it mu&s;t be a &s;on, and not a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t, that mu&s;t be offered, why will not I&s;hmael do, the &s;on of the bond-woman?

<PB N="85" REF="029886_0080_0FE2C0672E33D9B0">
<HI>whom thou love&s;t,</HI> &s;ays God, in who&s;e life his own was wrapped up: And this &s;on, this only &s;on, this I&s;aac, the &s;on of his love, mu&s;t be taken now, even now without delay, and be offered up by his own father, for a burnt offering, upon one of the moun|tains of the which God would tell him.</P>
<P>Well might the apo&s;tle, &s;peaking of this man of God, &s;ay, that <HI>again&s;t hope he believed in hope, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, being &s;trong in faith, gave glory to God:</HI> For, had he not been ble&s;&s;ed with faith which man ne|ver before had, he mu&s;t have refu&s;ed to comply with this &s;evere command. For how many argu|ments might nature &s;ugge&s;t, to prove that &s;uch a command could never come from God, or to ex|cu&s;e him&s;elf from obeying it? "What! (might the good man have &s;aid) butcher my child! it is contrary to the very law of nature: Much more to butcher my dear &s;on I&s;aac, in who&s;e &s;eed God him&s;elf has a&s;&s;ured me, that all the families of the earth &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed. But &s;uppo&s;ing I could give up my own affections, and be willing to part with him, though I love him &s;o dearly, yet, if I murder him, what will become of God's promi&s;e? Be&s;ides I am now like a city built upon a hill; I &s;hine as a light in the world, in the mid&s;t of a crooked and perver&s;e generation: How then &s;hall I cau&s;e God's name to be bla&s;phemed, how &s;hall I become a by-word among the heathen, if they hear that I have committed a crime which they abhor! But, above all, what will Sarah my wife &s;ay? How can I ever return to her again, after I have imbrued my hands in my dear child's blood? O that God would pardon me in this thing, or take my life in the place of my &s;on's!" Thus, I &s;ay, Abraham might have argued, and that too &s;eemingly with great rea&s;on, again&s;t complying with the divine
<PB N="86" REF="029886_0081_0FE2BFD273BDFCA8">
command. But, as before by faith he con&s;idered not the deadne&s;s of Sarah's womb, when &s;he was pa&s;t age, but believed on him, who &s;aid, "Sarah thy wife &s;hall bear thee a &s;on indeed;" &s;o now being convinced that the &s;ame God &s;poke to, and commanded him to offer up that &s;on, and know|ing that God was able to rai&s;e him from the dead, without delay he obeys the heavenly call.</P>
<P>O that unbelievers would learn of faithful A|braham, and believe whatever is revealed from God, though they cannot fully comprehend it! Abraham knew God commanded him to offer up his &s;on, and therefore believed, notwith&s;tanding carnal rea&s;oning might &s;ugge&s;t many objections. We have &s;ufficient te&s;timony, that God has &s;po|ken to us by his Son; why &s;hould we not al&s;o be|lieve, though many things in the New Te&s;tament are above our rea&s;on? For, where rea&s;on ends, faith begins. And, however infidels may &s;tyle them&s;elves rea&s;oners, of all men they are the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable: For is it not contrary to all rea&s;on, to mea&s;ure an infinite by a finite under&s;tanding, or think to find out the my&s;teries of godline&s;s to perfection?</P>
<P>But to return to the patriarch Abraham: We ob&s;erved before what plau&s;ible objections he might have made; but he an&s;wered not a &s;ingle word: No, without replying again&s;t his Maker, we are told, ver. 3. that "Abraham ro&s;e up early in the morning, and &s;addled his a&s;s, and took two of his young men with him, and I&s;aac his &s;on, and clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and ro&s;e up and went unto the place of which God had told him."</P>
<P>From this ver&s;e we may gather, that God &s;poke to Abraham in a dream, or vi&s;ion of the night: For it is &s;aid, he <HI>ro&s;e up early.</HI> Perhaps it was
<PB N="87" REF="029886_0082_0FE2C06FF262D1A8">
near the fourth watch of the night, ju&s;t before break of day, when God &s;aid, <HI>Take now thy &s;on;</HI> and Abraham ri&s;es up early to do &s;o; as I doubt not but he u&s;ed to ri&s;e early to offer up his morn|ing &s;acrifice of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving. It is oft|en remarked of people in the Old Te&s;tament, that they ro&s;e early in the morning; and particularly of our Lord in the New, that he ro&s;e a great while before day to pray. The morning befriends de|votion; and if people cannot u&s;e &s;o much &s;elf-de|nial as to ri&s;e early to pray, I know not how they will be able to die at a &s;take (if called to it) for Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The humility, as well as piety of the patriarch, is ob&s;ervable: He &s;addled his own a&s;s (great men &s;hould be humble;) and to &s;hew his &s;incerity, though he took two of his young men with him, and I&s;aac his &s;on, yet he keeps his de&s;ign as a &s;e|cret from them all: Nay, he does not &s;o much as tell Sarah his wife: For he knew not but &s;he might be a &s;nare unto him in this affair; and, as R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ekah afterwards, on another occa&s;ion, advi&s;ed Jacob to flee, &s;o Sarah al&s;o might per&s;uade I&s;aac to hide him&s;elf; or the young men, had they known of it, might have forced him away, as in after-ages the &s;oldiers re&s;cued Jonathan out of the hands of Soul. But Abraham &s;ought no &s;uch eva|&s;ion, and therefore, like an I&s;raelite indeed, in whom there was no guile, he him&s;elf re&s;olutely "clave the wood for the burnt-offering, ro&s;e up and went unto the place of which God had told him." In the &s;econd ver&s;e, God commanded him to offer up his &s;on upon one of the mountains which he would tell him of. He commanded him to offer his &s;on up, but would not then directly tell him the place where: This was to keep him

dependent and watching unto prayer: For there's nothing like being kept waiting upon God; and, if we do, a&s;&s;uredly God will reveal him&s;elf unto us yet further in his own time. Let us practi&s;e what we know, follow providence &s;o far as we can &s;ee already; and what we know not, what we &s;ee not as yet, let us only be found in the way of duty, and the Lord will reveal even that unto us. Abra|ham knew not directly where he was to offer up his &s;on; but he ri&s;es up and &s;ets forward, and be|hold now God &s;hews him; and he went to the place of which God had told him. Let us go and do likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>Ver. 4. Then on the third day, Abraham lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> up his eyes, and &s;aw the place afar off.</P>
<P>So that the place, of which God had told him, was no le&s;s than three days journey di&s;tant from the place where God fir&s;t appeared to him, and commanded him to take his &s;on. Was not this to try his faith, and to let him &s;ee that what he did, was not merely from a &s;udden pang of devo|tion, but a matter of choice and deliberation? But who can tell what the aged patriarch felt during the&s;e three days? Strong as he was in faith, I am per&s;uaded his bowels often yearned over his dear &s;on I&s;aac. Methinks I &s;ee the good old man walk|ing with his dear child in his hand, and now and then looking upon him, loving him, and then turning a&s;ide to weep. And perhaps, &s;ometimes he &s;tays a little behind to pour out his heart be|fore God; for he had no mortal to tell his ca&s;e to. Then, methinks, I &s;ee him join his &s;on and &s;er|vants again, and talking to them of the things per|taining to the kingdom of God, as they walked by the way. At length, on the third day, he lift up his eyes and &s;aw the place afar off. And, to

&s;hew that he was yet &s;incerely re&s;olved to do what|&s;over the Lord required of him, he even now will not di&s;cover his de&s;ign to his &s;ervants, but &s;aid, ver. 5. to his young men (as we &s;hould &s;ay to our worldly thoughts when about to tread the courts of the Lord's hou&s;e) "abide you here with the a&s;s; and I and the lad will go up yonder and wor|&s;hip, and come again to you."

Little did I&s;aac think that he was to be offered on that very wood which he was carrying upon his &s;houlders; and therefore, ver. 7. I&s;aac innocently, and with a holy freedom (for good men &s;hould not keep their chil|dren at too great a di&s;tance) &s;pake unto Abra|ham his father, and &s;aid, My father; and he (with equal affection and holy conde&s;cen&s;ion) &s;aid, Here am I, my &s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> And to &s;hew how careful Abra|ham had been (as all Chri&s;tian parents ought to be) to in&s;truct his I&s;aac how to &s;acrifice to God, like a youth trained up in the way wherein he &s;hould go; I&s;aac &s;aid, Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?

<P>Hitherto, it is plain, I&s;aac knew nothing of his father's de&s;ign: But I believe, by what his father &s;aid in an&s;wer to his que&s;tion, that now was the time Abraham revealed it unto him.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 8. "And Abraham &s;aid, my &s;on, God will provide him&s;elf a lamb for a burnt-offering." Some think that Abraham by faith &s;aw the Lord Je&s;us afar off, and here &s;pake prophetically of that Lamb of God already &s;lain in decree, and hereafter to be actually offered up for &s;inners. This was a lamb of God's providing indeed (we dared not have thought of it) to &s;atisfy his own ju&s;tice, and to render him ju&s;t in ju&s;tifying the ungodly. What is all our fire and wood, the be&s;t preparation and performances we can make or pre&s;ent unle&s;s God had provided him&s;elf this Lamb for a burnt offer|ing? He could not away with them. The words will well bear this interpretation. But, whatever Abraham might intend. I cannot but think he here made an application, and acquainted his &s;on of God's dealing with his &s;oul; and at length, with tears in his eyes, and the utmo&s;t affection in his heart, cried out, "Thou art to be the lamb, my &s;on; God has commanded me to provide thee for a burnt offering, and to offer thee upon a mountain which we are now a&s;cending." And, as it appears from a &s;ub&s;equent ver&s;e, I&s;aac, con|vinced that it was the divine will, made no re&s;i&s;t|ance at all; for it is &s;aid, "they went both of them together;" and again, ver&s;e 9, when we are
<PB N="91" REF="029886_0086_0FE2C07DCA634958">
told that Abraham bound I&s;aac, we do not hear of his complaining or endeavouring to e&s;cape, which he might have done, being (as &s;ome think) near thirty years of age, and it is plain, capable enough for carrying wood enough for a burnt-of|fering. But he was partaker of the like precious faith with his aged father, and therefore is as will|ing to be offered, as Abraham is to offer him: and &s;o they went both of them together.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 6. At length "they came to the place of which God had told Abraham. He built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound I&s;aac his &s;on, and laid him on the altar upon the wood."</P>
<P>And here let us pau&s;e awhile, and by faith take a view of the place where the father has laid him. I doubt not but the ble&s;&s;ed angels hovered round the altar and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ang, Glory be to God in the highe&s;t, for giving &s;uch faith to man.

<P>And now, ver. 10. The fatal blow is going to be given. "And Abraham &s;tretched forth his hand, and took the knife to &s;lay his &s;on." But&punc; do you not think he intended to turn away his head, when he gave the blow? Nay, why may we not &s;uppo&s;e he &s;ometimes drew his hand in, after it was &s;tretched out, willing to take another la&s;t farewel of his beloved I&s;aac, and de&s;irous to defer it a little, though re&s;olved at la&s;t to &s;trike home? Be that as it will, his arm is now &s;tretched out, the knife is in his hand, and he is about to put it to his dear &s;on's throat.</P>
<P>But &s;ing, O heavens! and rejoice, O earth! Man's extremity is God's opportunity: for behold, ju&s;t as the knife, in all probability, was near his throat, ver. 11. "the angel of the Lord, (or rather, the Lord of angels, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the angel of the everla&s;ting covenant) called unto him (probably in a very audible manner) from heaven, and &s;aid, Abraham, Abraham.&punc; (The word is doubled, to engage his attention; and perhaps the &s;uddenne&s;s of the call made him draw back his hand, ju&s;t as he was going to &s;trike his &s;on) And Abraham &s;aid, Here am I."</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="029886_0088_0FE2C082A1FFDF68">
And he &s;aid, ver&s;e 12. "Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now know I that thou feare&s;t God, &s;eeing thou ha&s;t not withheld thy &s;on, thine only &s;on from me."</P>
<P>Here then it was that Abraham received his &s;on I&s;aac from the dead in a figure. He was in effect offered upon the altar, and God looked upon him as offered and given unto him. Now it was that Abraham's faith, being tried, was found more pre|cious than gold purified &s;even times in the fire. Now as a reward of grace, though not of debt, for this &s;ignal act of obedience, by an oath, God gives and confirms the promi&s;e, "that in his &s;eed all the nations of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed," ver&s;e 17, 18. With what comfort may we &s;up|po&s;e the good old man and his &s;on went down from the mount, and returned unto the young men! With what joy we imagine he went home, and related all that had pa&s;&s;ed to Sarah! And above all, with what triumph is he exulting now in the paradi&s;e of God, and adoring rich, free, di&s;|tingui&s;hing, electing, everla&s;ting love, which alone made him to differ from the re&s;t of mankind, and rendered him worthy of that title which he will have &s;o long as the &s;un and the moon endure: "The father of the faithful!"</P>
<P>But let us now draw our eyes from the creature, and do what Abraham, if he was pre&s;ent, would direct to; I mean, fix them on the Creator, God ble&s;&s;ed for evermore.</P>

<P>From hence we may learn the nature of true ju&s;tifying faith. Whoever under&s;tands and preach|es the truth as it is in Je&s;us, mu&s;t acknowledge, that &s;alvation is God's free gift, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;aved, not by any or all the works of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> which we have done or can do; no; we can neither wholly nor in part ju&s;tify our&s;elves in the &s;ight of God. The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is our righteou&s;ne&s;s; and if we are accepted with God, it mu&s;t be only in and through the per&s;onal righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, the active and pa&s;&s;ive obedience of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t his beloved Son. This righteou&s;ne&s;s mu&s;t be imputed, or counted over to us, and ap|plied by faith to our hearts, or el&s;e we can in no wi&s;e be ju&s;tified in God's &s;ight: and that very mo|ment a &s;inner is enabled to lay hold on Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s by faith, he is freely ju&s;tified from all his &s;ins, and &s;hall never enter into condemnation, notwith&s;tanding he was a fire brand of hell before. Thus it was that Abraham was ju&s;tified before he did any good work: he was enabled to believe on the Lord Chri&s;t; it was accounted to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> righteou&s;ne&s;s; that is, Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s was made over to him, and &s;o accounted his. This, this is go&s;pel; this is the only way of finding ac|ceptance
<PB N="97" REF="029886_0092_0FE2C08E801E6158">
with God: good works have nothing to do with our ju&s;tification in his &s;ight. We are ju&s;|tified by faith alone, as faith the article of our church; agreeable to which the apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays, "By grace ye are &s;aved, through faith; and that not of your&s;elves; it is the gift of God." Not|with&s;tanding good works have their proper place: they ju&s;tify our faith, though not our per&s;ons; they follow it, and evidence our ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of men. Hence it is that the apo&s;tle James a&s;ks, was not Abraham ju&s;tified by works (allud|ing no doubt to the &s;tory on which we have been di&s;cour&s;ing) that is, did he not prove he was in a ju&s;tified &s;tate, becau&s;e his faith was productive of good works? This declarative ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of men, is what is directly to be under&s;tood in the words of the text: "Now know I," &s;ays God, "that thou feare&s;t me, &s;ince thou ha&s;t not withheld thy &s;on, thine only &s;on from me." Not but that God knew it before; but this is &s;poken in conde&s;cen&s;ion to our weak capacities, and plain|ly &s;hews, that his offering up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;on was accepted with God, as an evidence of the &s;incerity of his faith, and for this, was left on record to future ages. Hence then you may learn, whether you are ble&s;&s;ed with, and are &s;ons and daughters of faithful Abraham. You &s;ay you believe; you talk of free grace, and free ju&s;tification: you do well; the devils al&s;o believe and tremble. But has the faith which you pretend to, influenced your hearts, renewed your &s;ouls, and, like Abra|ham's, worked by love? Are your affections, like his, &s;et on things above? Are you heavenly-minded, and, like him, do you confe&s;s your&s;elves &s;trangers and pilgrims on the earth? In &s;hort, has
<PB N="98" REF="029886_0093_0FE2BFFB68044EF8">
your faith enabled you to overcome the world, and &s;trengthened you to give up your I&s;aacs, your laughter, your mo&s;t beloved lu&s;ts, friends, plea|&s;ures, and profits for God? If &s;o, take the com|fort of it; for ju&s;tly may you &s;ay, "We know a&s;|&s;uredly, that we do fear and love God, or rather are loved of him." But if you are only talking believers, have only a faith of the head, and never felt the power of it in your hearts, however you may bol&s;ter your&s;elves up, and &s;ay, "we have A|braham for our father, or Chri&s;t is our Saviour;" unle&s;s you get a faith of the heart, a faith working by love, you &s;hall never &s;it with Abraham, I&s;aac, Jacob, or Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the kingdom of heaven.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t draw one more inference, and with that I &s;hall conclude.</P>
<P>Learn, O &s;aints! from what has been &s;aid, to &s;it loo&s;e to all your worldly comforts; and &s;tand ready prepared to part with every thing, when God &s;hall require it at your hand. Some of you perhaps may have friends, who are to you as your own &s;ouls, and others may have children, in who&s;e lives your own lives are bound up: all I believe have their I&s;aacs, their particular delights of &s;ome kind or other. Labour, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, labour, ye &s;ons and daughters of Abraham, to re&s;ign them, daily in affection to God, that, when he &s;hall re|quire you really to &s;acrifice them, you may not confer with fle&s;h and blood, any more th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> the ble&s;&s;ed patriarch now before us.

<P>IT is an undoubted truth, however it may &s;eem a paradox to natural men, that "who&s;oever will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hall &s;uffer per&s;ecu|tion." And therefore it is very remarkable, that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, in his glorious &s;ermon on the Mount, after he had been pronouncing tho&s;e ble&s;|&s;ed, who were poor in &s;pirit, meek, pure in heart, and &s;uch like, immediately adds (and &s;pends no le&s;s than three ver&s;es in this beatitude) "Ble&s;&s;ed are they who are per&s;ecuted for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake." No one ever was, or ever will be endowed with the forementioned graces in any degree, but he will be per&s;ecuted for it in a mea&s;ure. There is an ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">concileable enmity between the &s;eed of the woman, and the &s;eed of the &s;erpent. And if we are not of the world, but &s;hew by our fruits that we are of the number of tho&s;e whom Je&s;us Chri&s;t has cho&s;en out of the world, for that very rea&s;on the world will hate us. As this is true of every particular Chri&s;tian, &s;o it is true of every Chri&s;tian church in general. For &s;ome years pa&s;t we have heard but little of a public per&s;ecution: why! Becau&s;e but little of the power of godline&s;s has prevailed among&s;t all denominations. The &s;trong

man armed has had full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mo&s;t pro|fe&s;&s;ors' hearts, and therefore he has let them re&s;t in a fal&s;e peace. But we may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, when Je&s;us Chri&s;t begins to gather in his elect in any remarkable manner, and opens an effectual door for preaching the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, per&s;ecu|tion will flame out, and Satan and his emi&s;&s;aries will do their utmo&s;t (though all in vain) to &s;top the work of God. Thus it was in the fir&s;t ages; thus it is in our days, and thus it will be till time &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tians, and Chri&s;tian churches mu&s;t then expect enemies. Our chief concern &s;hould be, to learn how to behave towards them in a Chri&s;tian manner: for unle&s;s we take good heed to our|&s;elves, we &s;hall embitter our &s;pirits, and act unbe|coming the followers of the Lord, "who, when he was reviled, reviled not again&punc; when he &s;uffer|ed, threatened not; and, as a lamb before his &s;hearers is dumb; &s;o opened he not his mouth." But what motive &s;hall w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> make u&s;e of to bring our&s;elves to this ble&s;&s;ed Lamb-like temper? Next to the immediate operation of the Holy Spirit up|on our hearts, I know of no con&s;ideration more conducive to teach us long-&s;uffering towards our mo&s;t bitter per&s;ecutors; than this, "That, for all that we know to the contrary, &s;ome of tho&s;e very per&s;ons, who are now per&s;ecuting, may be cho&s;en from all eternity by God, and hereafter called in time, to edify and build up the church of Chri&s;t."</P>

I &s;ay, a per&s;ecutor, and that a bloody one: for &s;ee how he is introduced in the beginning of this chapter; "and Saul yet breathing out threaten|ings and &s;laughter again&s;t the di&s;ciples of our Lord, went unto the high prie&s;t, and de&s;ired of him let|ters to Dama&s;cus to the &s;ynagogues, that if he found any of THIS WAY, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jeru|&s;alem."</P>
<P>"And Saul yet breathing out." This implies that he had been a per&s;ecutor before.

He &s;eems, though young to be in &s;ome authority. Perhaps, for his zeal again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, he was preferred in the church, and was allowed to &s;it in the great council or &s;anhedrim; for we are told, chap. viii. ver. I. "That Saul was con&s;enting unto his death;" and again, at ver. 3. he is brought in as exceeding all in his oppo&s;ition; for thus &s;peaks the evangeli&s;t, "as for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every hou&s;e, and haling men and women, committed them to pri&s;on." One would have imagined, that this &s;hould have &s;atisfied; at lea&s;t abated the fury of this young zealot. No: being exceedingly mad again&s;t them, as he him&s;elf informs Agrippa, and having made havock of all in Jeru&s;alem, he now is re&s;olved to per&s;ecute the di&s;ciples of the Lord, even to &s;trange cities; and therefore yet breathing out threat|ening. "Breathing out." The words are very emphatical, and expre&s;&s;ive of his bitter enmity. It was a natural to him now to threaten the
<PB N="103" REF="029886_0098_0FE2C099E6B52248">
Chri&s;tians, as it was for him to breathe: he could &s;carce &s;peak, but it was &s;ome threatenings again&s;t them. Nay, he not only breathed out threaten|ings, but &s;laughters al&s;o (and tho&s;e who threaten, would al&s;o &s;laughter, if it were in their power) again&s;t the di&s;ciples of the Lord. In&s;atiable there|fore as hell, finding he could not refute or &s;top the Chri&s;tians by force of argument, he is re&s;olved to do it by force of arms; and therefore went to the high prie&s;t (for there never was a per&s;ecution yet without a high prie&s;t at the head of it) and de&s;ired of him letters, i&s;&s;ued out of his &s;piritual court, to the &s;ynagogues or eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts at Dama&s;cus, giving him authority, "that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Je|ru&s;alem"&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e to be arraigned and con|demned in the high prie&s;t's court. Ob&s;erve how he &s;peaks of the Chri&s;tians. Luke, who wrote the Acts, calls them di&s;ciples of the Lord, and Saul &s;tyles them men and women of this way. I doubt not but he repre&s;ented them as a company of up&s;tart enthu&s;ia&s;ts, that had lately gotten into a new method or way of living; that would not be content with the temple-&s;ervice, but they mu&s;t he righteous over-much, and have their private meetings or conventicles; and break bread, as they called it, from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, to the great di&s;turbance of the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy, and to the utter &s;ubver&s;ion of all order and decency. I do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear that the high prie&s;t makes any objection: No, he was as willing to grant letters, as Saul was to a&s;k them; and wonderfully plea&s;ed within him&s;elf, to find he had &s;uch an active zealot to employ again&s;t the Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="029886_0099_0FE2C01128A12B38">
Well then, a judicial proce&s;s is immediately i&s;|&s;ued out, with the high prie&s;t's &s;eal affixed to it. And now methinks I &s;ee the young per&s;ecutor finely equipped, and plea&s;ing him&s;elf with thoughts how triumphantly he &s;hould ride back with the men and women of this way, dragging after him to Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>What a condition may we imagine the poor di&s;ciples at Dama&s;cus were in at this time! No doubt they had heard of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ul's impri&s;oning and making havock of the &s;aints at Jeru&s;alem, and we may well &s;uppo&s;e were appri&s;ed of his de&s;ign again&s;t them. I am per&s;uaded this was a growing, becau&s;e a trying time with the&s;e dear people. O how did they wre&s;tle with God in prayer, be&s;eech|ing him either to deliver them from, or give them grace &s;ufficient to enable them to bear up under the fury of their per&s;ecutors? The high prie&s;t doubtle&s;s with the re&s;t of his reverend brethren, flattered them&s;elves, that they &s;hould now put an effectual &s;top to this growing here&s;y, and waited with impatience for Saul's return.</P>
<P>But, "He that &s;itteth in heaven laughs them to &s;corn, the Lord has them in deri&s;ion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">" And therefore, ver. 3. "As Saul journeyed, and came even near unto Dama&s;cus," perhaps to the very gates (our Lord permitting this, to try the faith of his di&s;ciples, and more con&s;picuou&s;ly to baffle the de&s;igns of his enemies) "&s;uddenly at mid|day, as he acquaints Agrippa) there &s;hined round about him a light from heaven," a light brighter than the &s;un; "and he fell to the earth (why not into hell?) and heard a voice &s;aying unto him, Saul, Saul, why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me?" The word is doubled, Saul, Saul: like that of our Lord to Martha; Martha, Martha; or the prophet, O
<PB N="105" REF="029886_0100_0FE2C0A146FBBC28">
earth, earth, earth! Perhaps the&s;e words came like thunder to his &s;oul. That they were &s;poken audibly, we are a&s;&s;ured from ver&s;e 7. His com|panions heard the voice. Our Lord now arre&s;ts the per&s;ecuting zealot, calling him by name; for the word never does us good, till we find it &s;poken to us in particular. "Saul, Saul, why per&s;ecute&s;t thou ME?" Put the empha&s;is upon the word <HI>why,</HI> what evil have I done? Put it upon the word <HI>per&s;ecute&s;t,</HI> why per&s;ecute&s;t! I &s;uppo&s;e Saul thought he was not per&s;ecuting; no, he was only putting the laws of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court into execution; but Je&s;us, who&s;e eyes are as a flame of fire, &s;aw through the hypocri&s;y of his heart, that, notwith|&s;tanding his &s;pecious pretences, all this proceeded from a per&s;ecuting &s;pirit, and &s;ecret enmity of heart again&s;t God; and therefore &s;ays, "Why per&s;ecute&s;t thou ME?" Put the empha&s;is upon the word ME, "Why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me?" Alas! Saul was not per&s;ecuting Chri&s;t, was he? He was only taking care to prevent innovations in the church, and bringing a company of enthu|&s;ia&s;ts to ju&s;tice, who otherwi&s;e would overturn the e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;titution. But Je&s;us &s;ays, "Why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me?" For what is done to Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples, he takes as done to him&s;elf, whether it be good or whether it be evil. He that touches Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples, touches the apple of his eye; and they that per&s;ecute the followers of our Lord would per&s;ecute our Lord him&s;elf, was he again to come and tabernacle among us.</P>
<P>I do not find that Saul gives any rea&s;on why he did per&s;ecute; no, he was &s;truck dumb; as every per&s;ecutor will be, when Je&s;us Chri&s;t puts this &s;ame que&s;tion to them at the terrible day of judgment. But being pricked at the heart, no

doubt with a &s;en&s;e not only of this, but of all his other offences again&s;t the great God, he &s;aid, ver. 5. "Who art thou, Lord?" See how &s;oon God can change the heart and voice of his mo&s;t bitter enemies. Not many days ago, Saul was not only bla&s;pheming Chri&s;t him&s;elf, but, as much as in him lay, compelling others to bla&s;pheme al&s;o: But now, he who before was an impo&s;tor, is called "Lord; who art thou, Lord?" This admirably points out the way in which God's Spirit works upon the heart: It fir&s;t powerfully convinces of &s;in, and of our damnable &s;tate; and then puts us upon inquiring after Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Saul being &s;truck to the ground, or pricked to the heart, cries out after Je&s;us, "Who art thou, Lord?" As many of you that were never &s;o far made &s;en|&s;ible of your damnable &s;tate, as to be made feel|ingly to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eek after Je&s;us Chri&s;t, were never yet truly convicted by, much le&s;s converted to, God. May the Lord, who &s;truck Saul, effectually now &s;trike all my Chri&s;t-le&s;s hearers, and &s;et them up|on inquiring after Je&s;us as their ALL in ALL! Saul &s;aid, "Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord &s;aid, I am Je&s;us, whom thou per&s;ecute&s;t." Nev|er did any one inquire truly after Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but Chri&s;t made a &s;aving di&s;covery of him&s;elf to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oul. It &s;hould &s;eem, our Lord appeared to him in per&s;on; for Ananias, afterwards &s;ays, "the Lord who appeared to thee in the way which thou came&s;t;" though this may only imply Chri&s;t's meeting him in the way; it is not much matter: It is plain Chri&s;t here &s;peaks to him, and &s;ays "I am Je&s;us, whom thou per&s;ecute&s;t." It is remark|able, how our Lord takes to him&s;elf the name of Je&s;us; for it is a name in which he delights: I am Je&s;us, a Saviour of my people; both from the

guilt and power of their &s;ins; a "Je&s;us, whom thou per&s;ecute&s;t." This &s;eems to be &s;poken to convince Saul more and more of his &s;in: and I doubt not, but every word was &s;harper than a two-edged &s;word, and came like &s;o many daggers to his heart: O, how did the&s;e words affect him! a Je&s;us! a Saviour! and yet I am per&s;ecuting him! This &s;trikes him with horror; but then the word Je&s;us, though he was a per&s;ecutor, might give him &s;ome hope. However, our dear Lord, to convince Saul that he was to be &s;aved by grace, and that he was not afraid of his power and en|mity, tells him, "It is hard for thee to kick a|gain&s;t the pricks." As much as to &s;ay, though he was per&s;ecuting, yet he could not overthrow the church of Chri&s;t: For he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it as King upon his holy hill of Zion; the malice of men or devils &s;hould never be able to prevail again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Ver. 6. And he "trembling and a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;aid, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" Tho&s;e, who think Saul had a di&s;covery of Je&s;us made to his heart before, think that this que&s;tion is the re&s;ult of his faith, and that he now de&s;ires to know what he &s;hall do, out of gratitude, for what the Lord had done for his &s;oul; in this &s;en&s;e it may be under&s;tood,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See my Sermon on, <HI>What think ye of Chri&s;t?</HI></NOTE> and I have made u&s;e of it as an in&s;tance to prove, that faith will work by love; but perhaps it may be more agreeable to the context, if we &s;uppo&s;e that Saul had only &s;ome di&s;tant di&s;covery of Chri&s;t made to him, and not a full a&s;&s;urance of faith: For we are told, "he trembling and a&s;toni&s;hed," trembling at the thoughts of his per&s;ecuting a Je&s;us, and a&s;toni&s;h|ed at his own vilene&s;s, and the infinite conde&s;cen|&s;ion
<PB N="108" REF="029886_0103_0FE2C01BDC5DA860">
of this Je&s;us, cries out, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" Per&s;ons under &s;oul-trouble, and &s;ore conviction, would be glad to do any thing, or comply on any terms, to get peace with God. "Ari&s;e &s;ays our Lord) and go into the city, and it &s;hall be told thee what thou &s;halt do."</P>
<P>And here we will leave Saul a while, and &s;ee what is become of his companions. But what &s;hall we &s;ay? God is a &s;overeign agent; his &s;acred Spi|rit bloweth when and where it li&s;teth; "He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy." Saul is taken, but, as far as we know to the contrary, his fellow-travellers are left to peri&s;h in their &s;ins; For we are told, ver. 7. "That the men who journeyed with him &s;tood, indeed &s;peechle&s;s, and hearing a confu&s;ed voice," for &s;o the word &s;ignifies, and mu&s;t be &s;o interpreted, in order to reconcile it with chap. xxii. ver. 9. where Saul giving an ac|count of the&s;e men, tells Agrippa, "They heard not the voice of him that &s;pake to me." They heard a voice, a confu&s;ed noi&s;e, but not the articu|late voice of him that &s;pake to Saul, and therefore remained unconverted. For what are all ordi|nances, all, even the mo&s;t extraordinary di&s;pen&s;a|tions of providence, without Chri&s;t &s;peaks to the &s;oul in them? Thus it is now under the word preached: many, like Saul's companions, are &s;ome|times &s;o &s;truck with the out-goings of God ap|pearing in the &s;anctuary, that they even &s;tand &s;peechle&s;s; they hear the preacher's voice, but not the voice of the Son of God, who, perhaps at the &s;ame time is &s;peaking effectually to many other hearts; this I have known often; and what &s;hall we &s;ay to the&s;e things? O the depth of the &s;ov|ereignty of God! It is pa&s;t finding out. Lord&punc; I de&s;ire to adore what I cannot comprehend. "Ev|en

<P>But to return to Saul: the Lord bids him ari&s;e and go into the city; and we are told, ver. 8. that "Saul aro&s;e from the earth; and when his eyes were opened," (he was &s;o overpowered with the greatne&s;s of the light that &s;hone upon them) that "he &s;aw no man; but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Dama&s;cus," that ve|ry city which was to be the place of his executing or impri&s;oning the di&s;ciples of the Lord. "And he was three days without fight, and neither did eat nor drink." But who can tell what horrors of con&s;cience, what convul&s;ion of &s;oul, what deep and pungent convictions of &s;in he underwent dur|ing the&s;e three long days? It was this took away his appetite (for who can eat or drink when under a &s;en&s;e of the wrath of God for &s;in?) and, being to be greatly employed hereafter, he mu&s;t be great|ly humbled now; therefore the Lord leaves him three days groaning under the &s;pirit of bondage, and buffetted, no doubt, with the fiery darts of the devil, that, being tempted like unto his bre|thren, he might be able hereafter, to &s;uccour tho&s;e that were tempted. Had Saul applied to any of the blind guides of the Jewi&s;h church under the&s;e circum&s;tances, they would have &s;aid, he was mad, or going be&s;ide him&s;elf; as many carnal teachers and blind Phari&s;ees now deal with, and &s;o more and more di&s;tre&s;s poor &s;ouls labouring under a|wakening convictions of their damnable &s;tate.

This was afterwards remark|ably exemplified in Saul, who was three days with|out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight, and neither did eat nor drink.</P>
<P>But will the Lord leave his poor &s;ervant in this di&s;tre&s;s? No: his Je&s;us (though Saul per&s;ecuted him) promi&s;ed (and he will perform) that it "&s;hould be told him what he mu&s;t do. And there was a certain di&s;ciple at Dama&s;cus, named Ananias, and unto him, &s;aid the Lord in a vi&s;ion, Ananias; and he &s;aid, Behold, I am here, Lord." What a holy familiarity is there between Je&s;us Chri&s;t and regenerate &s;ouls! Ananias had been u&s;ed to &s;uch love-vi&s;its, and therefore knew the voice of his beloved. The Lord &s;ays, Ananias; Ananias &s;ays, "Behold, I am here, Lord." Thus it is that Chri&s;t now, as well as formerly, often talks with his children at &s;undry times, and after divers manners, as a man talketh with his friend. But what has the Lord to &s;ay to Ananias?</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 11. "And the Lord &s;aid unto him, ari&s;e, and go into the &s;treet, which is called Streight, and inquire in the hou&s;e of Judas, for one called Saul of Tar&s;us;" (&s;ee here for your comfort, O children of the mo&s;t high God, what notice Je&s;us Chri&s;t takes of the &s;treet, and the hou&s;e where his own dear &s;ervants lodge) "for behold, he prayeth;" but why is this u&s;hered in with the word <HI>behold&punc;</HI> What, was it &s;uch a wonder to hear that Saul was
<PB N="111" REF="029886_0106_0FE2C14D02460800">
praying? Why, Saul was a Phari&s;ee&punc; and there|fore, no doubt, fa&s;ted and made long prayers and, &s;ince we are told that he profited above ma|ny of his equals, I doubt not but he was taken no|tice of for his gift in prayer; and yet it &s;eems, that before the&s;e three days, Saul never prayed in his life; and why? Becau&s;e, before the&s;e three days, he never felt him&s;elf a condemned creature: he was alive in his own opinion, becau&s;e without a knowledge of the &s;piritual meaning of the law; he felt not a want of, and therefore, before now, cried not after a Je&s;us, and con&s;equently, though he might have &s;aid, or made a prayer, as many Phari&s;ees do now-a-days, he never prayed a pray|er; but now, behold! he prayed indeed; and this was urged as one rea&s;on why he was convert|ed. None of God's children, as one ob&s;erves, comes into the world &s;till-born; prayer is the ve|ry breath of the new creature: and therefore, if we are prayerle&s;s, we are Chri&s;t-le&s;s; if we never had the &s;pirit of &s;upplication, it is a &s;ad &s;ign that we never had the &s;pirit of grace in our &s;ouls: and you may be a&s;&s;ured you never did pray, unle&s;s you have felt your&s;elves &s;inners, and &s;een the want of Je&s;us to be your Saviour. May the Lord, whom I &s;erve in the go&s;pel of his dear Son, prick you all to the heart, and may it be &s;aid of you all as it was of Saul, Behold, they pray!</P>
<P>The Lord goes on to encourage Ananias to go to Saul: &s;ays he, ver&s;e 12. "For he hath &s;een in a vi&s;ion a man named Ananias, coming i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his &s;ight." So that though Chri&s;t converted Saul immediately by him&s;elf, yet he will carry on the work, thus begun, by a mini&s;ter. Happy they, who under &s;oul troubles have &s;uch experienced
<PB N="112" REF="029886_0107_0FE2C0BA151DEA10">
guides, and as well acquainted with Je&s;us Chri&s;t as Ananias was: you that have &s;uch, make much of and be thankful for them; and you who have them not, tru&s;t in God; he will carry on his own work without them.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, Ananias was a good man; but &s;hall I commend him for his an&s;wer to our Lord? I commend him not: for &s;ays he, ver&s;e 13, "Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy &s;aints at Jeru&s;alem: and here he hath authority from the chief prie&s;ts to bind all that call upon thy name." I fear this an|&s;wer proceeded from &s;ome relics of &s;elf-righteou&s;|ne&s;s, as well as infidelity, that lay undi&s;covered in the heart of Ananias. "Ari&s;e (&s;aid our Lord) and go into the &s;treet, which is called Streight, and inquire in the hou&s;e of Judas, for one called Saul of Tar&s;us; for behold he prayeth!" One would think this was &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy him: but &s;ays Ananias, "Lord I have heard by many of this man" (he &s;eems to &s;peak of him with much contempt; for even good men are apt to think too contemptuou&s;ly of tho&s;e who are yet in their &s;ins) "how much evil he hath done to thy &s;aints in Jeru&s;alem: and here, he hath authority from the chief prie&s;ts, to bind all that call upon thy name." And what then, Ananias? Is any thing too hard for the Lord? Who made thee to differ? Could not he who converted thee, convert him al&s;o! Surely Ananias here forgets him&s;elf, or per|haps fears, left this man, who had authority from the chief prie&s;ts to bind all that call upon Chri&s;t's name, &s;hould bind him al&s;o, if he went unto him; but the Lord &s;ilences all objections, with a "Go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hy way, for he is a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the
<PB N="113" REF="029886_0108_0FE2C153276ECD88">
children of I&s;rael. For I will &s;hew him how great things he mu&s;t &s;uffer for my name's &s;ake." Here God &s;tops his mouth immediately, by a&s;&s;erting his &s;overeignty, and preaching to him the doctrine of election. And the frequent conver&s;ion of no|torious &s;inners to God, to me is one great proof, among a thou&s;and others, of that precious, but too much exploded, and &s;adly mi&s;repre&s;ented doc|trine of God's electing love; for whence is it that &s;uch are taken, while thou&s;ands not near &s;o vile, die &s;en&s;ele&s;s and &s;tupid? All the an&s;wer that can be given, is, "They are cho&s;en ve&s;&s;els, Go thy way (lays God) for he is a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of I&s;rael: for I will &s;hew him how great things he mu&s;t &s;uffer for my name's &s;ake." Ob&s;erve what a clo&s;e connection there is between doing and &s;uffering for Chri&s;t. If any of my brethren in the mini&s;try are pre&s;ent, let them hear what preferment we mu&s;t expect, if we are called out to work remarkably for God: not great prebendaries or bi&s;hoprics, but great &s;ufferings for our Lord's name &s;ake; the&s;e are the fruits of our labour; and he that will not contentedly &s;uffer great things for preaching Chri&s;t, is not worthy of him. Suffering will be found to be the be&s;t pre|ferment, when we are called to give an account of our mini&s;try at the great day.</P>
<P>I do not hear that Ananias quarrelled with God concerning the doctrine of election: no; O that all good men would, in this, learn of him! "He went his way, and entered into the hou&s;e; and put his hands on him, and &s;aid, Brother Saul;" ju&s;t now it was this man; now it is Brother Saul: It is no matter what a man has been, if he be now

a Chri&s;tian; the &s;ame &s;hould be our brother, our &s;i&s;ter, and mother: God blots out every convert's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions as with a thick cloud, and &s;o &s;hould we; the more vile a man has been, the more &s;hould we love him when believing in Chri&s;t, be|cau&s;e Chri&s;t will be more glorified on his behalf. I doubt not, but Ananias was wonderfully delight|ed to hear that &s;o remarkable a per&s;ecutor was brought home to God! I am per&s;uaded he felt his &s;oul immediately united to him by love, and therefore addre&s;&s;es him not with, "Thou per&s;e|cutor, Thou murderer, that came&s;t to butcher me and my friends; but, brother Saul." It is remarkable that the primitive Chri&s;tians much u&s;ed the word brother and brethren; I know it is a term now much in reproach; but tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e it, I believe would be glad to be of our brotherhood, when they &s;ee us &s;itting at the right hand of the Maje&s;ty on high. "Brother Saul, the Lord (even Je&s;us that appeared unto thee in the way as thou came&s;t) hath &s;ent me, that thou mighte&s;t receive thy &s;ight, and be filled with the Holy Gho&s;t." At this time, we may &s;uppo&s;e, he laid his hands upon him. See the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Ver. 18. "Immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been &s;cales, and he received &s;ight forth|with;" not only bodily, but &s;piritual &s;ight; he emerged as it were into a new world; he &s;aw, and felt too, things unutterable: he felt a union of &s;oul with God; he received the &s;pirit of adoption; he could now, with a full a&s;&s;urance of faith, cry, <HI>Abba, Father.</HI> Now was he filled with the Holy Gho&s;t; and had the love of God &s;hed abroad in his heart; now were the days of his mourning ended; now was Chri&s;t formed in his &s;oul; now he could give men and devils the challenge, know|ing
<PB N="115" REF="029886_0110_0FE2C1594D735048">
that Chri&s;t had ju&s;tified him; now he &s;aw the excellences of Chri&s;t, and e&s;teemed him the faire&s;t among ten thou&s;and.&mdash;You only know how to &s;ympathize with the apo&s;tle in his joy, who, after a long night of bondage, have been &s;et free by the Spirit, and have received joy in the Holy Gho&s;t. May all that are now mourning, as Saul was, be comforted in like manner!</P>
<P>The &s;cales then are now removed from the eyes of Saul's mind; Ananias has done that for him, under God: he mu&s;t now do another office&mdash;bap|tize him, and &s;o receive him into the vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t; a good proof to me of the nece&s;&s;ity of bapti&s;m where it may be had: for I find here, as well as el&s;ewhere, that bapti&s;m is admini&s;tered ev|en to tho&s;e who had received the Holy Gho&s;t; Saul was convinced of this, and therefore aro&s;e and was baptized; and now it is time for him to recruit the outward man, which, by three days ab&s;tinence and &s;piritual conflicts, had been much impaired: we are therefore told (ver&s;e 19) "when he had re|ceived meat, he was &s;trengthened."</P>
<P>But O, with what comfort did the apo&s;tle now eat his food! I am &s;ure it was with &s;inglene&s;s, I am per&s;uaded al&s;o with gladne&s;s of heart; and why? He knew that he was reconciled to God; and, for my own part, did I not know how blind and flinty our hearts are by nature, I &s;hould won|der how any one could eat even his common food with any &s;atisfaction, who has not &s;ome well-grounded hope of his being reconciled to God. Our Lord intimates thus much to us: for in his glorious prayer, after he has taught us to pray for our daily bread, immediately adds that petition, "forgive us our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es;" as though our daily
<PB N="116" REF="029886_0111_0FE2C0C71D5425F0">
bread would do us no &s;ervice, unle&s;s we were &s;en|&s;ible of having the forgivene&s;s of our &s;ins.</P>
<P>To proceed: Saul hath received meat, and is &s;trengthened; and whither will he go now? To &s;ee the brethren; "then was Saul certain days with the di&s;ciples that were at Dama&s;cus." If we know and love Chri&s;t, we &s;hall al&s;o love, and de|&s;ire to be acquainted with the brethren of Chri&s;t: We may generally know a man by his company. And though all are not &s;aints that a&s;&s;ociate with &s;aints (for tares will be always &s;pringing up among the wheat till the time of harve&s;t) yet, if we never keep company, but are &s;hy and a&s;hamed of the de&s;pi&s;ed children of God, it is a certain &s;ign we have not yet experimentally learnt Je&s;us, or re|ceived him into our hearts. My dear friends, be not deceived; if we are friends to the Bridegroom, we &s;hall be friends to the children of the Bride|groom. Saul, as &s;oon as he was filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, "was certain days with the di&s;ciples that were at Dama&s;cus."</P>
<P>But who can tell what joy the&s;e di&s;ciples felt when Saul came among them! I &s;uppo&s;e holy Ananias introduced him. Methinks I &s;ee the once per&s;ecuting zealot, when they came to &s;alute him with a holy ki&s;s, throwing him&s;elf upon each of their necks, weeping over them with floods of tears, and &s;aying, "O my brother, O my &s;i&s;ter, Can you forgive me? Can you give &s;uch a wretch as I the right hand of fellow&s;hip, who intended to drag you behind me bound unto Jeru&s;alem!"&mdash;Thus, I &s;ay, we may &s;uppo&s;e Saul addre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf to his fellow-di&s;ciples; and I doubt not but they were as ready to forgive and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orget as Ana|nias was, and &s;aluted him with the endearing ti|tle of brother Saul. Lovely was this meeting; &s;o
<PB N="117" REF="029886_0112_0FE2C15EAD530318">
lovely, that it &s;eemed Saul continued certain days with them, to communicate experiences, and to learn the way of God more perfectly, to pray for a ble&s;&s;ing on his future mini&s;try, and to prai&s;e Chri&s;t Je&s;us for what he had done for their &s;ouls. Saul, perhaps, had &s;at certain years at the feet of Gamaliel, but undoubtedly learnt more the&s;e cer|tain days, than he had learnt before in all his life. It plea&s;es me to think how this great &s;cholar is transformed by the renewing of his mind: what a mighty change was here! That &s;o great a man as Saul was, both as to his &s;tation in life, and in|ternal qualifications, and &s;uch a bitter enemy to the Chri&s;tians; for him, I &s;ay, to go and be cer|tain days with the people of <HI>this mad way,</HI> and to &s;it quietly, and be taught of illiterate men, as ma|ny of the&s;e di&s;ciples we may be &s;ure were, what a &s;ub&s;tantial proof was this of the reality of his con|ver&s;ion!</P>
<P>What a hurry and confu&s;ion may we &s;uppo&s;e the chief prie&s;ts now were in! I warrant they were ready to cry out, what! is he al&s;o deceived? As for the common people, who know not the law and are accur&s;ed, for them to be carried away is no &s;uch wonder; but for a man bred up at the feet of Gamaliel, for &s;uch a &s;cholar, &s;uch an ene|my to the cau&s;e as Saul; for him to be led away with a company of &s;illy, deceived men and wo|men, &s;urely it is impo&s;&s;ible: We cannot believe it. But Saul &s;oon convinces them of the reality of his becoming a fool for Chri&s;t's &s;ake: For &s;traightway, in&s;tead of going to deliver the letters from the high prie&s;ts, as they expected, in order to bring the di&s;ciples that were at Dama&s;cus bound to Jeru&s;alem, "he preached Chri&s;t in the &s;yna|gogues, that he is the Son of God." This was
<PB N="118" REF="029886_0113_0FE2C0CBF6FE6268">
another proof of his being converted. He not only conver&s;ed with Chri&s;tians in private, but he preached Chri&s;t publicly in the &s;ynagogues: E&s;pe|cially, he in&s;i&s;ted on the divinity of our Lord, proving, notwith&s;tanding his &s;tate of humiliation, that he was really the Son of God.</P>
<P>But why did Saul preach Chri&s;t thus? Becau&s;e he had felt the power of Chri&s;t upon his own &s;oul. And here is the rea&s;on why Chri&s;t is &s;o &s;eldom preached, and his divinity &s;o &s;lightly in&s;i&s;ted on in our &s;ynagogues, becau&s;e the generality of tho&s;e that pretend to preach him, never felt a &s;aving work of conver&s;ion upon their own &s;ouls. How can they preach, unle&s;s they are fir&s;t taught of, and then &s;ent by God? Saul did not preach Chri&s;t before he knew him; no more &s;hould any one el&s;e. An unconverted mini&s;ter, though he could &s;peak with the tongues of men and angels, will be but as a &s;ounding bra&s;s and tinkling cymbal to tho&s;e who&s;e &s;en&s;es are exerci&s;ed to di&s;cern &s;piritual things. Mini&s;ters that are unconverted, may talk and declaim of Chri&s;t, and prove from books that he is the Son of God; but they cannot preach with the demon&s;tration of the Spirit and with power, unle&s;s they preach from experience, and have had a proof of his divinity, by a work of grace wrought upon their own &s;ouls. God forgive tho&s;e who lay hands on an unconverted man, knowing that he is &s;uch&punc; I would not do it for a thou&s;and worlds. Lord Je&s;us, keep thy own faith|ful &s;ervants pure, and let them not be then parta|kers of other men's &s;ins!</P>
<P>Such an in&s;tance as was Saul's conver&s;ion, we may be a&s;&s;ured, mu&s;t make a great deal of noi&s;e; and, therefore, no wonder we are told, ver. 21. "But all that heard him were amazed, and &s;aid,
<PB N="119" REF="029886_0114_0FE2C166448472C8">
Is not this he that de&s;troyed them who called on this name in Jeru&s;alem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound to the chief prie&s;ts?"</P>
<P>Thus it will be with all that appear publicly for Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and it is as impo&s;&s;ible for a true Chri&s;tian to be hid, as a city built upon a hill.&mdash;Brethren, if you are faithful to, you mu&s;t be re|proached and have remarks made on you for Chri&s;t; e&s;pecially if you have been remarkably wicked before your conver&s;ion. Your friends &s;ay, is not this he, or &s;he, who a little while age would run to as great exce&s;s of riot and vanity as the wor&s;t of us all? What has turned your brain? Or if you have been clo&s;e, fal&s;e, formal hypocrites, as Saul was, they will wonder that you &s;hould be &s;o deceived, as to think you were not in a &s;afe &s;tate before. No doubt, numbers were &s;urpri&s;ed to hear Saul, who was touching the law blamele&s;s, affirm that he was in a damnable condition (as in all probability he did) a few days before.</P>
<P>Brethren, you mu&s;t expect to meet with many &s;uch difficulties as the&s;e. The &s;courge of the tongue is generally the fir&s;t cro&s;s we are called to beat for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t. Let not, therefore, this move you: It did not intimidate, no, it ra|ther encouraged Saul.</P>
<P>Says the text, "But Saul increa&s;ed the more in &s;trength, and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Dama&s;cus, proving that this is very Chri&s;t." Op|po&s;ition never yet did, nor ever will hurt a &s;incere convert: Nothing like oppo&s;ition to make the man of God perfect. None but a hireling, who careth not for the &s;heep, will be affrighted at the approach or barking of wolves. Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters
<PB N="120" REF="029886_0115_0FE2C0D2837A9060">
are as bold as lions: It is not for &s;uch men as they to flee.</P>
<P>And therefore (that I may draw towards a con|clu&s;ion) let the mini&s;ters and di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t learn from Saul, not to fear men or their revil|ings; but, like him, increa&s;e in &s;trength, the more wicked men endeavour to weaken their hands.&mdash;We cannot be Chri&s;tians without being oppo&s;ed: No; di&s;ciples in general mu&s;t &s;uffer; mini&s;ters in particular mu&s;t &s;uffer great things. But let not this move any of us from our &s;teadfa&s;tne&s;s in the go&s;pel: He that &s;tood by and &s;trengthened Saul, will al&s;o &s;tand by and &s;trengthen us: He is a God mighty to &s;ave all that put their tru&s;t in him. If we look up with an eye of faith, we, as well as the fir&s;t martyr St. Stephen may &s;ee Je&s;us &s;tanding at the right hand of God, ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t and protect us. Though the Lord's &s;eat is in heaven, yet he has re&s;pect to his &s;aints in an e&s;pecial manner, when &s;uffering here on earth: Then the Spirit of Chri&s;t and of glory re&s;ts upon their &s;ouls. And, if I may &s;peak my own experience, "I never en|joy more rich communication from God, than when de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of men for the &s;ake of Je&s;us Chri&s;t." However, little they may de&s;ign it, my enemies are my greate&s;t friends. What I mo&s;t fear, is a calm; but the enmity which is in the hearts of natural men again&s;t Chri&s;t, will not &s;uffer them to be quiet long: No; as I hope the work of God will increa&s;e, &s;o the rage of men and devils will increa&s;e al&s;o. Let us put on, there|fore, the whole armour of God: Let us not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear the face of men: Let us fear him only who can de&s;troy both body and &s;oul in hell: I &s;ay unto you, let us fear him alone. You &s;ee how &s;oon God can &s;top the fury of his enemies.</P>

You have ju&s;t now heard of a proud, powerful zealot &s;topped in his full career, &s;truck down to the earth with a light from heaven, converted by the almighty power of efficacious grace, and there|upon zealou&s;ly promoting, nay, re&s;olutely &s;uffer|ing for, the faith which once with threatnings and &s;laughters he endeavoured to de&s;troy. Let this teach us to pity and pray for our Lord's mo&s;t in|veterate enemies. Who knows, but in an&s;wer thereunto, our Lord may give them repentance unto life? Mo&s;t think, that Chri&s;t had re&s;pect to Stephen's prayer, when he converted Saul. Perhaps for this rea&s;on God &s;uffers his adver&s;aries to go on, that his goodne&s;s and power may &s;hine more bright in their conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>But let not the per&s;ecutors of Chri&s;t take en|couragement from this to continue in their oppo|&s;ition. Remember, though Saul was converted, yet the high prie&s;t and Saul's companions, were left dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins: And, if this &s;hould be your ca&s;e, you will of all men be mo&s;t mi&s;erable: For per&s;ecutors have the lowe&s;t place in hell. And, if Saul was &s;truck to the earth by a light from heaven, how will you be able to &s;tand before Je&s;us Chri&s;t, when he comes in terrible maje&s;ty to take vengeance on all tho&s;e who have per&s;ecuted his go&s;pel? Then the que&s;tion, "Why per&s;ecuted thou me?" will cut you through and through. The &s;ecret enmity of your hearts &s;hall be then detected before men and angels, and you &s;hall be doomed to dwell in the blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s for evermore.

<P>OF all the ver&s;es in the book of God, this whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> I have now read to you, is, I believe, one of the mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive: What glad tid|ings does it bring to believers!

unto us:" the Father, he it is who is &s;poken of here. Not as though Je&s;us Chri&s;t was not God al&s;o; but God the Father is the fountain of the Deity; and, if we con&s;ider Je&s;us Chri&s;t acting as Mediator, God the Father is greater than he; there was an eternal contract between the Father and the Son: "I have made a covenant with my cho&s;en, and I have &s;worn unto David my &s;ervant;" now David was a type of Chri&s;t, with whom the Father made a covenant, that if he would obey and &s;uffer, and make him&s;elf a &s;acrifice for &s;in, he &s;hould "&s;ee his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eed, he &s;hould prolong his days, and the plea&s;ure of the Lord &s;hould pro&s;per in his hands." This compact our Lord refers to, in that glorious prayer recorded in the 17th chap. of John; and therefore he prays for, or rather de|mands with a full a&s;&s;urance, all that were given to him by the Father: "Father, I will that they al|&s;o whom thou ha&s;t given me, be with me where I am." For this &s;ame rea&s;on the apo&s;tle breaks out in prai&s;es of God, even the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for he loved the elect with an everla&s;ting love, or, as our Lord expre&s;&s;es it, "before the foundation of the world;" and there|fore, to &s;hew them to whom they were beholden for their &s;alvation, our Lord, in the 25th of Mat|thew, repre&s;ents him&s;elf, &s;aying, "Come, ye ble&s;&s;|ed children of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." And thus, in reply to the mother of Zebedee's children, he &s;ays, "It is not mine to give, but it &s;hall be given to them for whom it is prepared of the Father." The apo&s;tle therefore, when here &s;peaking of the Chri&s;tian's privileges, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;acrifice to their own drag, or

<P>Would to God, this part of doctrine was con|&s;idered more, and people were more &s;tudious of the covenant of redemption between the Father and the Son! we &s;hould not then have &s;o much di&s;puting again&s;t the doctrine of election, or hear it condemned (even by good men) as a doctrine of devils.

But what &s;hall I &s;ay? Election is a my&s;tery that &s;hines with &s;uch re&s;plendent brightne&s;s, that, to make u&s;e of the words of one who has drank deep|ly of electing love, it dazzles the weak eyes even of &s;ome of God's dear children; however, though they know it not, all the ble&s;&s;ings they receive, all the privileges they do or will enjoy through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, flow from the everla&s;ting love of God the Father: "But of him are you in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who of God is made unto us, wi&s;dom, righteou&s;|ne&s;s, &s;anctification, and redemption."</P>

Even wi&s;dom it&s;elf a&s;&s;ures us, "that a man's life doth not con|&s;i&s;t in the abundance of the things which he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es;" vanity, vanity, all the&s;e things are vanity; for, if riches leave not the owner, the owners mu&s;t &s;oon leave them; "for rich men mu&s;t al&s;o die, and leave their riches for others;" their rich|es cannot procure them redemption from the grave, whither we are all ha&s;tening apace.</P>
<P>But perhaps you de&s;pi&s;e riches and plea&s;ure, and therefore place wi&s;dom in the knowledge of books: but it is po&s;&s;ible for you to tell the num|bers of the &s;tars, and call them all by their names, and yet be mere fools; learned men are not al|ways wi&s;e; nay, our common learning &s;o much cried up, makes men only &s;o many accompli&s;hed fools; to keep you therefore no longer in &s;u&s;pence, and withal to humble you, I will &s;end you to a heathen &s;chool, to learn what true wi&s;dom is: <HI>know thy&s;elf,</HI> was a &s;aying of one of the wi&s;e men of Greece; this is certainly true wi&s;dom, and
<PB N="128" REF="029886_0123_0FE2C0EC0E160888">
this is that wi&s;dom &s;poken of in the text, and which Je&s;us Chri&s;t has made to all elect &s;inners; they are made to know them&s;elves, &s;o as not to think more highly of them&s;elves, &s;o as not to think more highly of them&s;elves, than they ought to think. Before they were darkne&s;s; now they are light in the Lord; and in that light they &s;ee their own darkne&s;s; they now bewail them&s;elves as fallen creatures by nature, dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, &s;ons and heirs of hell, and children of wrath; they now &s;ee that all their righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es are but as filthy rags; that there is no health in their &s;ouls; that they are poor and mi&s;erable, blind and naked; and that there is no name given under heaven, whereby they can be &s;aved, but that of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. They &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of clo&s;ing with a Saviour, and behold the wi&s;dom of God in appointing him to be a Saviour; they are al&s;o made willing to accept of &s;alvation upon our Lord's own terms, and to receive him as their all in all: thus Chri&s;t is made to them wi&s;dom.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s. "Who of God is made unto us, wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s;" Chri&s;t's whole per&s;onal righteou&s;ne&s;s is made over to, and accounted theirs. Being enabled to lay hold on Chri&s;t by faith, God the Father blots out their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, as with a thick cloud; their &s;ins, and their iniquities he remembers no more; they are made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in Je&s;us, who is the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believeth. In one &s;en&s;e, God now &s;ees no &s;in in them; the whole covenant of works is fulfilled in them; they are actually ju&s;tified, ac|quitted, and looked upon as righteous in the &s;ight of God; they are perfectly accepted in the Belov|ed; they are complete in him; the flaming &s;word of God's wrath, which before moved every way,
<PB N="129" REF="029886_0124_0FE2C17FC17565D8">
is now removed, and free acce&s;s given to the tree of life; they are enabled now to reach out the arm of faith, and pluck and live for evermore.&mdash;Hence it is that the apo&s;tle, under a &s;en&s;e of this ble&s;&s;ed privilege, breaks out into this triumphant language, "it is Chri&s;t that ju&s;tifies, who is he that condemns?" Does &s;in condemn? Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s delivers believers from the guilt of it: Chri&s;t is their Saviour, and is become a pro|pitiation for their &s;ins: who therefore &s;hall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? Does the law condemn? By having Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s impu|ted to them, they are dead to the law, as a cove|nant of works; Chri&s;t has fulfilled it for them, and in their &s;tead. Does death threaten them? They need not fear: The &s;ting of death is &s;in, the &s;trength of &s;in is the law; but God has given them the victory, by imputing to them the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us.</P>
<P>And what a privilege is here! Well might the angels at the birth of Chri&s;t, &s;ay to the humble &s;hepherds, "Behold, I bring you glad tidings of great joy;" unto you that believe in Chri&s;t, "a Saviour is born." And well may they rejoice at the conver&s;ion of poor &s;inners: for the Lord is their righteou&s;ne&s;s: they have peace with God, through faith in Chri&s;t's blood, and &s;hall never enter into condemnation. O believers! (for this di&s;cour&s;e is intended in a &s;pecial manner for you) lift up your heads; "Rejoice in the Lord always; again I &s;ay, rejoice." Chri&s;t is made to you of God, righteou&s;ne&s;s, what then &s;hould you fear? you are made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him; you may be called, "The Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s." Of what then &s;hould you be afraid? What &s;hall &s;eparate you henceforward from the love of Chri&s;t?
<PB N="130" REF="029886_0125_0FE2C0F236D06110">
Shall tribulation, or di&s;tre&s;s, or per&s;ecution, or fam|ine, or nakedne&s;s, or peril, or &s;word? No; I am per&s;uaded, neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things pre&s;ent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, &s;hall be able to &s;eparate you from the love of God, which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord, who of God is made unto you righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>This is a glorious privilege, but this is only the beginning of the happine&s;s of believers: for,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Chri&s;t is not only made to them righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, but &s;anctification. By &s;anctification, I do not mean a bare hypocritical attendance on outward ordinances (though rightly informed Chri&s;tians will think it their duty and privilege con&s;tantly to attend on all outward ordinances.) Nor do I mean by &s;anctification, a bare outward reformation, and a few tran&s;ient convictions, or a little legal &s;orrow; for all this an un&s;anctified man may have; but, by &s;anctification I mean a total renovation of the whole man; by the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, believers become legally, by &s;anctification they are made &s;piritually, alive; by one they are entitled to, by the other they are made meet for glory. They are &s;anctified there|fore throughout, in &s;pirit, &s;oul and body.</P>
<P>Their under&s;tandings, which were before dark, now become light in the Lord: and their will, before contrary to, now become one with the will of God: their affections are now &s;et on things a|bove; their memory is now filled with divine things; their natural con&s;ciences are now enlight|ened; their members, which were before in&s;tru|ments of uncleanne&s;s, and of iniquity unto iniqui|ty, are now in&s;truments of righteou&s;ne&s;s and true
<PB N="131" REF="029886_0126_0FE2C1845D3153E0">
holine&s;s; in &s;hort, they are new creatures; "old things are pa&s;&s;ed away, all things are become new," in their hearts; &s;in has now no longer do|minion over them; they are freed from the pow|er, though not the indwelling and being of it; they are holy both in heart and life, in all manner of conver&s;ation; they are made partakers of a divine nature; and from Je&s;us Chri&s;t they receive grace for grace; and every grace that is in Chri&s;t, is copied and tran&s;cribed into their &s;ouls; they are transformed into his likene&s;s; he is formed within them; they dwell in him, and he in them; they are led by the Spirit, and bring forth the fruits thereof: they know that Chri&s;t is their Im|manuel, God with and in them; they are living temples of the Holy Gho&s;t. And therefore, be|ing a holy habitation unto the Lord, the whole Trinity dwells and walks in them; even here, they fit together with Chri&s;t in heavenly places, and are vitally united to him, their head, by a living faith; their Redeemer, their Maker, is their hu&s;band; they are fle&s;h of his fle&s;h, bone of his bone; they talk, they walk with him, as a man talketh and walketh with his friend; in &s;hort, they are one with Chri&s;t, even as Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the Father are one.</P>
<P>Thus is Chri&s;t made to believers &s;anctification. And O what a privilege is this! To be changed from bea&s;ts into &s;aints, and from a devili&s;h, to be made partakers of a divine nature; to be tran&s;|lated from the kingdom of Satan, into the king|dom of God's dear Son! To put off the old man, which is corrupt, and to put on the new man, which is created after God, in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s. O what an un&s;peakable ble&s;&s;ing is this!

<P>But, before we enter upon the explanation and contemplation of this privilege,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Learn hence the great mi&s;take of tho&s;e writers, and clergy, who, notwith&s;tanding they talk of &s;anctification and inward holine&s;s (as in|deed &s;ometimes they do, though in a very loo&s;e and &s;uperficial manner) yet they generally make it the cau&s;e, whereas they &s;hould con&s;ider it as the effect, of our ju&s;tification. Of him "are ye in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who of God is made unto us wi&s;|dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s," and then &s;anctification. For Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, or that which Chri&s;t has done in our &s;tead without us, is the &s;ole cau&s;e of our acceptance in the &s;ight of God, and of all ho|line&s;s wrought in us: To this, and not to the light within, or any thing wrought within, &s;hould poor &s;inners &s;eek for ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God: for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s alone, and not any thing wrought in us, does God look favourably upon us; our &s;anctification at be&s;t, in this life, is not complete: Though we are deliv|ered from the power, we are not freed from the in-being of &s;in; but not only the dominion, but the in-being of &s;in, is forbidden by the perfect law of God: For it is not &s;aid, "thou &s;halt not
<PB N="134" REF="029886_0129_0FE2C0FE80B66F20">
give way to lu&s;t, but, thou &s;halt not lu&s;t." So that whil&s;t the principle of lu&s;t remains in the lea&s;t degree in our hearts, though we are otherwi&s;e nev|er &s;o holy, yet we cannot, on account of that, hope for acceptance with God. We mu&s;t fir&s;t therefore, look for a righteou&s;ne&s;s without us, even the righteou&s;ne&s;s of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: For this rea&s;on the apo&s;tle mentions it, and puts it before &s;anctification in the words of the text. And who&s;oever teacheth any other doctrine, doth not preach the truth as it is in Je&s;us.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> From hence al&s;o, the Antinomians and formal hypocrites may be confuted, who talk of Chri&s;t without, but know nothing, experimental|ly, of a work of &s;anctification wrought within them. Whatever they may pretend to, &s;ince Chri&s;t is not in them, the Lord is not their righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and they have no well-grounded hope of glory: For though &s;anctification is not the cau&s;e, yet it is the effect of our acceptance with God; "who of God is made unto us righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;anctification." He therefore, that is really in Chri&s;t, is a new creature; it is not going back to a covenant of works, to look into our hearts, and, &s;eeing that they are changed and renewed, from thence form a comfortable and well-grounded a&s;|&s;urance of the &s;afety of our &s;tates: No, but this is what we are directed to in &s;cripture; by our bringing forth the fruits, we are to judge whether or no we ever did truly partake of the Spirit of God, "We know (&s;ays John) that we are pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life, becau&s;e we love the breth|ren." And however we may talk of Chri&s;t's righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and exclaim again&s;t legal preachers: yet, if we are not holy in heart and life, if we are not &s;anctified and renewed by the Spirit in our
<PB N="135" REF="029886_0130_0FE2C19024A40528">
minds, we are &s;elf-deceivers, we are only formal hypocrites: For we mu&s;t not put a&s;under what God has joined together; we mu&s;t keep the me|dium between the two extremes; not in&s;i&s;t &s;o much on the one hand upon Chri&s;t without, as to exclude Chri&s;t within, as an evidence of our being his, and as a preparation for future happine&s;s; nor on the other hand, &s;o depend on inherent righte|ou&s;ne&s;s or holine&s;s wrought in us, as to exclude the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t without us. But,</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Let us now go on, and take a view of the other link, or rather the end, of the believer's golden chain of privileges, redemption. But we mu&s;t look very high; for the top of it, like Ja|cob's ladder, reaches heaven, where all believers will a&s;cend, and be placed at the right hand of God. "Who of God is made unto us, wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification, and redemption."</P>
<P>This is a golden chain indeed! And, what is be&s;t of all, not one link can ever be broken a&s;un|der from another. Was there no other text in the book of God, this &s;ingle one &s;ufficiently proves the final per&s;everance of true believers? for never did God yet ju&s;tify a man, whom he did not &s;anc|tify; nor &s;anctify one whom he did not complete|ly redeem and glorify; no, as for God, his way, his work, is perfect; he always carried on and fini&s;hed the work he began; thus it was in the fir&s;t, &s;o it is in the new creation; when God &s;ays, "let there be light," there is light, that &s;hines more and more unto the perfect day, when believers en|ter into their eternal re&s;t, as God entered into his. Tho&s;e whom God has ju&s;tified, he has in effect glorified: for as a man's worthine&s;s was not the cau&s;e of God's giving him Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o neither &s;hall his unworthine&s;s be a cau&s;e of his
<PB N="136" REF="029886_0131_0FE2C104037BEC08">
taking it away; God's gifts and callings are with|out repentance; and I cannot think, they are clear in the notion of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, who deny the final per&s;everance of the &s;aints; I fear, they under&s;tand ju&s;tification in that low &s;en&s;e, which I under&s;tood it in a few years ago, as im|plying no more than remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins: but it not only &s;ignifies remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins pa&s;t, but al&s;o a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|deral right to all good things to come. If God has given us his only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">on, how will he not with him freely give us all things? Therefore, the apo&s;|tle, after he &s;ays, "who of God is made unto us righteou&s;ne&s;s," does not &s;ay, perhaps he may be made to us &s;anctification and redemption; but he is made: for there is an eternal, indi&s;&s;oluble con|nection between the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed privileges. As the obedience of Chri&s;t is imputed to believers, &s;o his per&s;everance in that obedience is to be imputed to them al&s;o: and it argues great ignorance of the covenant of grace and redemption to object again&s;t it.</P>
<P>By the word redemption, we are to under&s;tand, not only a complete deliverance from all evil, but al&s;o a full enjoyment of all good both in body and &s;oul: I &s;ay both in body and &s;oul: for the Lord is al&s;o for the body; the bodies of the &s;aints in this life are temples of the Holy Gho&s;t; God makes a covenant with the du&s;t of believers; after death, though worms de&s;troy them, yet, even in their fle&s;h &s;hall they &s;ee God. I fear, indeed, there are &s;ome Sadducees in our days, or at lea&s;t heretics, who &s;ay, either that there is no re&s;urrec|tion of the body, or that the re&s;urrection is pa&s;t already, namely, in our regeneration: Hence it is, that our Lord's coming in the fle&s;h, at the day of judgment, is denied; and con&s;equently, we mu&s;t
<PB N="137" REF="029886_0132_0FE2C1975134A5D8">
throw a&s;ide the &s;acrament of the Lord's Supper. For why &s;hould we remember the Lord's death until he come to judgment, when he is already come to judge our hearts, and will not come a &s;e|cond time? But all this is only the rea&s;oning of unlearned, un&s;table men, who certainly know not what they &s;ay, nor whereof they affirm. That we mu&s;t follow our Lord in the regeneration, be par|takers of a new birth, and that Chri&s;t mu&s;t come into our hearts, we freely confe&s;s, and we hope, when &s;peaking of the&s;e things, we &s;peak no more than what we know and feel: but then it is plain, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t will come, hereafter, to judg|ment, and that he a&s;cended into heaven with the body which he had here on earth; for, &s;ays he, after his re&s;urrection, "handle me, and &s;ee; a &s;pirit hath not fle&s;h and bones, as you &s;ee me have." And it is plain, that Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection was an earne&s;t of ours: for, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, "Chri&s;t is ri&s;en from the dead, and become the fir&s;t fruits of them that &s;lept;" and as in Adam all die and are &s;ubject to mortality; &s;o all that are in Chri&s;t, the &s;econd Adam, who repre&s;ented be|lievers as their foederal head, &s;hall certainly be made alive, or ri&s;e again with their bodies at the la&s;t lay.</P>
<P>Here then, O believers! is one, though the lowe&s;t, degree of that redemption which you are to be partakers of hereafter; I mean, the redemp|tion of your bodies: For this corruptible mu&s;t put on im|mortality. Your bodies, as well as &s;ouls, were given to Je&s;us Chri&s;t by the Father: they have been companions in watching, and fa&s;ting and praying: Your bodies therefore, as well as &s;ouls,
<PB N="138" REF="029886_0133_0FE2C109FA92DB98">
&s;hall Je&s;us Chri&s;t rai&s;e up at the la&s;t day. Fear not, therefore, O believers, to look into the grave; for to you it is no other than a con&s;ecrated dormi|tory, where your bodies &s;hall &s;leep quietly until the morning of the re&s;urrection; when the voice of the archangel &s;hall &s;ound, and the trump of God give the general alarm, "Ari&s;e ye dead, and come to judgment;" earth, air, fire, water, &s;hall give up your &s;cattered atoms, and both in body and &s;oul &s;hall you be ever with the Lord. I doubt not but many of you are groaning under crazy bodies, and complain often that the mortal body weighs down the immortal &s;oul; at lea&s;t this is my ca&s;e; but let us have a little patience, and we &s;hall be delivered from our earthly pri&s;ons; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re long, the&s;e tabernacles of clay &s;hall be di&s;&s;ol|ved, and we &s;hall be cloathed with our hou&s;e which is from heaven: hereafter, our bodies &s;hall be &s;piritualized, and &s;hall be &s;o far from hindering our &s;ouls through weakne&s;s, that they &s;hall be|come &s;trong; &s;o &s;trong, as to bear up under an exceeding and eternal weight of glory; others a|gain may have deformed bodies, emaciated al&s;o with &s;ickne&s;s, and worn out with labour and age; but wait a little, until your ble&s;&s;ed change by death comes; then your bodies &s;hall be renewed and made glorious, like unto Chri&s;t's glorious bo|dy: of which we may form &s;ome faint idea, from the account given us of our Lord's transfiguration on the Mount, when it is &s;aid, "His raiment be|came bright and glittering, and his face brighter than the &s;un." Well then may a believer break out into the apo&s;tle' triumphant language, 'O death, where is thy &s;ting! O grave, where is thy victory!"</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="029886_0134_0FE2C19BEE912480">
But what is the redemption of the body, in compari&s;on of the redemption of the better part, our &s;ouls? I mu&s;t, therefore, &s;ay to you believers, as the angel &s;aid to John, "Come up higher," and let us take as clear a view as we can, at &s;uch a di&s;tance, of the redemption Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed for, and will &s;hortly put you in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. Already you are ju&s;tified, already you are &s;anctified, and thereby freed from the guilt and dominion of &s;in: but, as I have ob&s;erved, the be|ing and indwelling of &s;in yet remains in you; God &s;ees it proper to leave &s;ome Amalekites in the land, to keep his I&s;rael in action. The mo&s;t per|fect Chri&s;tian, I am per&s;uaded, mu&s;t agree, ac|cording to one of our articles, "that the corrup|tion of nature remains even in the regenerate; that the fle&s;h lu&s;teth always again&s;t the &s;pirit, and the &s;pirit again&s;t the fle&s;h." So that believers cannot do things for God with that perfection they de&s;ire; this grieves their righteous &s;ouls day by day, and, with the holy apo&s;tle, makes them to cry out, "Who &s;hall deliver us from the body of this death!" I thank God, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t will, but not completely before the day of our di&s;&s;olution; then will the very being of &s;in be de&s;troyed, and an eternal &s;top put to inbred, in|dwelling corruption. And is not this a great re|demption? I am &s;ure believers e&s;teem it &s;o: for there is nothing grieves the heart of a child of God &s;o much, as the remains of indwelling &s;in. Again, believers are often in heavine&s;s through manifold temptations; God &s;ees that it is needful and good for them &s;o to be; and though they may be high|ly favoured, and wrapt up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> communion with God, even to the third heaven, yet a me&s;&s;enger of Satan is often &s;ent to buffet them, le&s;t they

<P>THOUGH there be &s;ome who dare to deny the Lord Je&s;us, and di&s;believe the revela|tion he has been plea&s;ed to give us, and thereby bring upon them&s;elves &s;wift de&s;truction; yet I would charitably hope there are but few, if any &s;uch among you to whom I am now to preach the kingdom of God. Was I to a&s;k you, "how you expect to be ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of an offended God?" I &s;uppo&s;e you would an&s;wer, only for the &s;ake of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But, was I to come more home to your con&s;ciences, I fear mo&s;t would make the Lord Je&s;us but in part their Sa|viour, and go about, as it were, to e&s;tabli&s;h a righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own. And this is not think|ing contrary to the rules of Chri&s;tian charity: For we are all &s;elf-righteous by nature; it is as natural for us to turn back to a covenant of works, as for the &s;parks to fly upwards. We have had &s;o many legal and &s;o few free-grace preachers, for the&s;e
<PB N="146" REF="029886_0141_0FE2C1228EA17BC0">
many years, that mo&s;t profe&s;&s;ors now &s;eem to be &s;ettled upon their lees, and rather de&s;erve the title of Phari&s;ees than Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Thus it was with the generality of the people during the time of our Lord's public mini&s;trations: And therefore, in almo&s;t all his di&s;cour&s;es, he preached the go&s;pel to poor &s;inners, and denounced terrible woes again&s;t proud &s;elf-ju&s;ticiaries. The parable to which the words of the text belong, looks both the&s;e ways: For the evangeli&s;t informs us (ver. 9.) that our Lord "&s;pake it unto certain who tru&s;ted in them&s;elves, that they were righte|ous, and de&s;pi&s;ed others." And a notable parable it is; a parable worthy your mo&s;t &s;erious attention. "He that hath ears to hear let him hear" what Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;peaks to all vi&s;ible profe&s;&s;ors in it.</P>
<P>Ver. 10. "Two men went up to the temple to pray," (and never two men of more oppo&s;ite cha|racters) "the one a Phari&s;ee, and the other a Pub|lican." The Phari&s;ees were the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ect a|mong the Jews; I was of the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ect of the Phari&s;ees, &s;ays Paul. They played often; not only &s;o, but they made long prayers; and, that they might appear extraordinary devout, they would pray at the corners of the &s;treet, where two ways met, that people going or coming, both ways, might &s;ee them. "They made broad (as our Lord informs us) the borders of their philacte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ies," they had pieces of parchment &s;own to their long robes, on which &s;ome parts of the &s;cripture were written, that people might from thence infer, that they were lovers of the law of God. They were &s;o very punctual and exact in outward purifications, that they wa&s;hed at their going out and coming in. They held the wa&s;hing of pots, brazen ve&s;&s;els and tables, and many other &s;uch-like things they
<PB N="147" REF="029886_0142_0FE2C1B352C13948">
did. They were very zealous for the traditions of the fathers, and for the ob&s;ervation of the rites and ceremonies of the church, notwith&s;tanding they frequently made void the law of God by their traditions. And they were &s;o exceedingly exact in the outward ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath, that they condemned our Lord for making a little clay with his &s;pittle; and called him a &s;inner, and &s;aid, he was not of God, becau&s;e he had given &s;ight to a man born blind, on the Sabbath-day. For the&s;e rea&s;ons they were had in high veneration among the people, who were &s;adly mi&s;led by the&s;e blind guides: They had the uppermo&s;t places in the &s;ynagogues, and greetings in the market places (which they loved dearly) and were called of men, Rabbi; in &s;hort, they had &s;uch a reputation for piety, that it became a proverb among the Jews, that if there were but two men &s;aved, the one of them mu&s;t be a Phari&s;ee.</P>
<P>As for the Publicans it was not &s;o with them. It &s;eems they were &s;ometimes Jews, or at lea&s;t pro|&s;elytes of the gate; for we find the one here com|ing up to the temple; but for the generality, I am apt to think they were Gentiles;&mdash;for they were gatherers of the Roman taxes, and u&s;ed to ama&s;s much wealth (as appears by the confe&s;&s;ion of Zac|cheus, one of the chief of them) by wronging men by fal&s;e accu&s;ations. They were &s;o univer&s;ally in|famous, that our Lord him&s;elf tells his di&s;ciples, the excommunicated man &s;hould be to them as a Heathen man, or a Publican. And the Phari&s;ees thought it a &s;ufficient impeachment of our Lord's character, that he was a "friend to Publicans and &s;inners, and went to &s;it down with them at meat."</P>
<P>But, however they di&s;agreed in other things, they agreed in this, that public wor&s;hip is a duty
<PB N="148" REF="029886_0143_0FE2C12933B76140">
incumbent upon all: For they both came up to the temple. The very Heathens were ob&s;ervers of temple-wor&s;hip. We have very early notice of men's &s;acrificing to, and calling upon the name of the Lord, in the Old Te&s;tament! and I find it no where contradicted in the new. Our Lord, and his apo&s;tles, went up to the temple; and we are commanded by the apo&s;tle, "not to for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling of our&s;elves together," as the manner of too many is in our days; and &s;uch too, as would have us think well of them, though they &s;eldom or never tread the courts of the Lord's hou&s;e. But, though our devotions begin in our clo&s;ets, they mu&s;t not end there. And, if people never &s;hew their devotions abroad, I mu&s;t &s;u&s;pect they have little or none at home. "Two men went up to the temple." And what went they thither for? Not (as multitudes among&s;t us do) to make the hou&s;e of God a hou&s;e of merchandi&s;e, or to turn it into a den of thieves; much le&s;s to ridicule the preacher, or di&s;turb the congregation. No, they came to the temple, &s;ays our Lord, to pray. Thither &s;hould the tribes of God's &s;piritual I&s;rael go up, to walk with and pour out their hearts be|fore the mighty God of Jacob.</P>
<P>"Two men went up to the temple to pray." I fear one of them forgot his errand. I have often been at a lo&s;s what to call the Phari&s;ee's addre&s;s; It certainly does not de&s;erve the name of prayer: He may rather be &s;aid to come to the temple to boa&s;t, than to pray; for I do not find one word of confe&s;&s;ion of his original guilt; not one &s;ingle pe|tition for pardon of his pa&s;t actual &s;ins, or for grace to help and a&s;&s;i&s;t him for the time to come: he only brings in God, as it were, a reckoning of
<PB N="149" REF="029886_0144_0FE2C1BA19DDEED8">
his performances, and does that, which no fle&s;h can ju&s;tly do, I mean, glory in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 11. "The Phari&s;ee &s;tood, and prayed thus with him&s;elf; God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unju&s;t, adulter|ers, or even as this Publican."</P>
<P>Our Lord fir&s;t takes notice of his po&s;ture; the Phari&s;ee &s;tood, he is not to be condemned for that; for &s;tanding, as well as kneeling, is a proper po&s;ture for prayer. When you &s;tand praying, &s;ays our Lord; though &s;ometimes our Lord kneeled, nay, lay &s;lat on his face upon the ground; his apo&s;tles al&s;o kneeled, as we read in the Acts, which has made me wonder at &s;ome, who are &s;o bigotted to &s;tanding in family as well as public prayer, that they will not kneel, notwith&s;tanding all kneel that are around them. I fear there is &s;omething of the Phari&s;ee in this conduct. Kneel|ing and &s;tanding are indifferent, if the knee of the &s;oul be bent, and the heart upright towards God. We &s;hould &s;tudy not to be particular in indiffer|ent things, le&s;t we offend weak minds. What the Phari&s;ee is remarked for, is his &s;tanding by him&s;elf: For the words may be rendered, he &s;tood by him&s;elf, upon &s;ome eminent place, at the upper part of the temple, near the holy of holies, that the congregation might &s;ee what a devout man he was: Or it may be under&s;tood as we read it, he prayed by him&s;elf or of him&s;elf out of his own heart; he did not pray by form; it was an extempore prayer: For there are many Phari|&s;ees that pray and preach too extempore. I do not &s;ee why the&s;e may not be acquired, as well as other arts and &s;ciences. A man, with a good elo|cution, ready turn of thought, and good memory,
<PB N="150" REF="029886_0145_0FE2C12EC8879800">
may repeat his own or other men's &s;ermons, and by the help of a Wilkins or Henry, may pray &s;eemingly excellently well, and yet not have the lea&s;t grain of true grace in his heart; and I &s;peak this, not to cry down extempore prayer, or to di&s;courage tho&s;e dear &s;ouls who really pray by the Spirit; I only would hereby give a word of re|proof to tho&s;e who are &s;o bigotted to extempore prayer, that they condemn, at lea&s;t judge, all that u&s;e forms, as though not &s;o holy and heavenly, as others who pray without them. Alas! this is wrong. Not every one that prays extempore is a &s;piritual, nor every one that prays with a form, a formal man. Let us not judge one another; let not him that u&s;es a form, judge him that prays extempore, on that account; and let not him that prays extempore, de&s;pi&s;e him who u&s;es a form.&mdash;"The Phari&s;ee &s;tood, and prayed thus by him|&s;elf." Which may &s;ignify al&s;o praying inwardly in his heart; for there is a way (and that an ex|cellent one too) of praying when we cannot &s;peak: thus Anna prayed when &s;he &s;poke not aloud, only her lips moved. Thus God &s;ays to Mo&s;es, "Why crie&s;t thou?" when it is plain, he did not &s;peak a word. This is what the apo&s;tle means by the "Spirit making interce&s;&s;ion (for believers) with groanings which cannot be uttered." For there are times when the &s;oul is too big to &s;peak; when God fills as it were, and over&s;hadows it with his pre&s;ence, &s;o that it can only fall down, wor&s;hip, adore, and lie in the du&s;t before the Lord. Again, there is a time when the &s;oul is benumbed, bar|ren and dry, and the believer has not a word to &s;ay to his heavenly Father; and then the heart only can &s;peak. And I mention this for the encou|ragement of weak Chri&s;tians, who think they nev|er
<PB N="151" REF="029886_0146_0FE2C1BFD8168100">
are accepted but when they have a flow of words, and fancy they do not plea&s;e God at the bottom, for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e they do not plea&s;e them&s;elves. Such would do well to con&s;ider, that God knows the language of the heart, and the mind of the &s;pirit; and that we make u&s;e of words, not to inform God, but to af|fect our&s;elves. Whenever therefore any of you find your&s;elves in &s;uch a frame, be not di&s;courag|ed: offer your&s;elves up in &s;ilence before God, as clay in the hands of the potter, for him to write and &s;tamp his own divine image upon your &s;ouls. But I believe the Phari&s;ee knew nothing of this way of prayer: he was &s;elf-righteous, a &s;tranger to the divine life; and therefore either of the for|mer explanations may be be&s;t put upon the&s;e words. "He &s;tood, and prayed thus with him&s;elf; God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, ex|tortioners, unju&s;t, adulterers, or even as this pub|lican." Here is &s;ome appearance of devotion, but it is only in appearance. To thank God, that we are not extortioners, unju&s;t, adulterers, and as wicked in our practices, as other men are, is certainly meet, right, and our bounden duty: for whatever degrees of goodne&s;s there may be in us, more than in others, it is owing to God's re|&s;training, preventing and a&s;&s;i&s;ting grace. We are all equally conceived and born in &s;in all are fall|en &s;hort of the glory of God, and liable to all the cur&s;es and maledictions of the law; &s;o that he that glorieth, mu&s;t glory only in the Lord. For none of us have any thing which he did not re|ceive; and whatever we have received, we did not in the lea&s;t merit it, nor could we lay the lea&s;t claim to it on any account whatever: we are wholly indebted to free grace for all. Had the
<PB N="152" REF="029886_0147_0FE2C136069A0488">
Phari&s;ee thought thus, when he &s;aid, "God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are," it would have been an excellent introduction to his prayer: but he was a free-willer, as well as &s;elf-righteous (for he that is the one mu&s;t be the oth|er) and thought by his own power and &s;trength he had kept him&s;elf from the&s;e vices. And yet I do not &s;ee what rea&s;on he had to tru&s;t in him&s;elf that he was righteous, merely becau&s;e he was not an extortioner, unju&s;t, adulterer; for all this while he might be, as he certainly was (as is al&s;o every &s;elf-righteous per&s;on) as proud as the devil. But he not only boa&s;ts, but lies before God (as all &s;elf-ju&s;ticiaries will be found liars here or here|after.) He thanks God that he was not unju&s;t: but is it not an act of the highe&s;t inju&s;tice to rob God of his prerogative? Is it not an act of inju&s;|tice to judge our neighbour? And yet of both the&s;e crimes this &s;elf-righteous vaunter is guilty. "Even as this Publican!" He &s;eems to &s;peak with the utmo&s;t di&s;dain; <HI>this Publican</HI> Perhaps he pointed at the poor man, that others might treat him with the like contempt. Thou proud, confident boa&s;ter, what had&s;t thou to do with that poor Publican? Suppo&s;ing other Publicans were unju&s;t and extortioners, did it therefore follow that he mu&s;t be &s;o? Or, if he had been &s;uch a &s;inner, how knowe&s;t thou but he has repented of tho&s;e &s;ins? His coming up to the temple to pray, is one good &s;ign of a reformation at lea&s;t. Thou art therefore inexcu&s;able, O Phari&s;ee, who thus judg|e&s;t the Publican; for thou that judge&s;t him to be unju&s;t, art, in the very act of judging, unju&s;t thy|&s;elf: thy &s;acrifice is only the &s;acrifice of a fool.</P>
<P>We have &s;een what the Phari&s;ee's negative goodne&s;s comes to; I think, nothing at all. Let

us now &s;ee how far his po&s;itive goodne&s;s extends; for, if we are truly religious, we &s;hall not e&s;chew evil, but al&s;o do good: "I fa&s;t twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I po&s;&s;e&s;s."</P>
<P>The Phari&s;ee is not here condemned for his fa&s;ting, for fa&s;ting is a Chri&s;tian duty; "when you fa&s;t," &s;ays our Lord, thereby taking it for granted, that his di&s;ciples would fa&s;t. And "when the bridegroom &s;hall be taken away, then &s;hall they fa&s;t in tho&s;e days." In fa&s;ting often, &s;ays the apo&s;tle. And all that would not be ca&s;t|aways, will take care, as their privilege, without legal con&s;traint, to "keep their bodies under, and bring them into &s;ubjection." The Phari&s;ee is only condemned for making a righteou&s;ne&s;s of his fa&s;ting, and thinking that God would accept him, or that he was any better than his neighbours, merely on account of his fa&s;ting: this is what he was blamed for. The Phari&s;ee was not to be di&s;|commended for fa&s;ting twice in a week; I wi&s;h &s;ome Chri&s;tians would imitate him more in this: but to depend on fa&s;ting in the lea&s;t, for his ju&s;ti|fication in the fight of God, was really abomina|ble. "I give tithes of all that I po&s;&s;e&s;s:" He might as well have &s;aid, I pay tithes. But &s;elf-righteous people (whatever they may &s;ay to the contrary) think they give &s;omething to God. I give tithes of all that I po&s;&s;e&s;s: I make con&s;ci|ence of giving tithes, not only of all that the law requires, but of my mint, anni&s;e, and cummin, of all things whatever I po&s;&s;e&s;s; this was well; but to boa&s;t of &s;uch things, or of fa&s;ting, is Phari&s;aical and devili&s;h. Now then let us &s;um up all the righteou&s;ne&s;s of this boa&s;ting Phari&s;ee, and &s;ee what little rea&s;on he had to tru&s;t in him&s;elf, that he was righteous, or to de&s;pi&s;e others. He is not
<PB N="154" REF="029886_0149_0FE2C13AD7275670">
unju&s;t (but we have only his word for that, I think I have proved the contrary;) he is no adulterer, no extortioner; he fa&s;ts twice in the week, and gives tithes of all that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; and all this he might do, and a great deal more, and yet be a child of the devil: for here is no mention made of his loving the Lord his God with all his heart, which was the "fir&s;t and great commandment of the law;" here is not a &s;ingle &s;yllable of inward religion; and he was not a true Jew, who was on|ly one outwardly. It is only an out&s;ide piety at the be&s;t; inwardly he is full of pride, &s;elf-ju&s;tifi|cation, free-will, and great uncharitablene&s;s.</P>
<P>Were not the Phari&s;ees, do you think, highly offended at this character? For they might ea&s;ily know that it was &s;poken again&s;t them. And though perhaps &s;ome of you may be offended at me, yet, out of love, I mu&s;t tell you, I fear this parable is &s;poken again&s;t many of you: For are there not many of you, who go up to the temple to pray, with no better &s;pirit than this Phari&s;ee did? And becau&s;e you fa&s;t, it may be in the Lent, or every Friday, and becau&s;e you do nobody any harm, receive the &s;acrament, pay tithes, give an alms now and then, you think that you are &s;afe, and tru&s;t in your&s;elves that you are righteous, and inward|ly de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e, who do not come up to you in the&s;e outward duties? This I am per&s;uaded is the ca&s;e of many of you, although alas! it is a de&s;|perate one, as I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew at the clo&s;e of this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Let us now take a view of the Publican, ver&s;e 13. "And the Publican &s;tanding afar off, would not lift up &s;o much as his eyes unto heaven, but &s;mote upon his brea&s;t, &s;aying, God be merciful to me a &s;inner."</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="029886_0150_0FE2C1CD087ABEF0">
The "Publican &s;tanding afar off:" Perhaps in the outward court of the temple, con&s;cious to him&s;elf that he was not worthy to approach the holy of holies; &s;o con&s;cious, and &s;o weighed down with a &s;en&s;e of his own unworthine&s;s, that he would not &s;o much as lift up his eyes unto heaven, which he knew was God's throne. Poor heart! what did he feel at this time! None but returning Publicans, like him&s;elf can tell. Methinks I &s;ee him &s;tand|ing afar off, pen&s;ive, oppre&s;&s;ed, and even over whelm|ed with &s;orrow; &s;ometimes he attempts to look up; but then, thinks he, the heavens are unclean in God's &s;ight, and the very angels are charged with folly; how then &s;hall &s;uch a wretch as I, dare to lift up my guilty head! And to &s;hew that his heart was full of holy &s;elf-re&s;entment, and that he &s;or|rowed after a godly &s;ort, he &s;mote upon his brea&s;t; the word in the original implies, that he &s;truck hard upon his brea&s;t; he will lay the blame upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">one but his own wicked heart. He will not, like un|humbled Adam, tacitly lay the fault of his vile|ne&s;s upon God, and &s;ay, the "pa&s;&s;ions which thou gave&s;t me, they deceived me, and I &s;inned:" he is too penitent thus to reproach his Maker: he &s;mites upon his brea&s;t, his treacherous, ungrateful, wick|ed brea&s;t; a brea&s;t now ready to bur&s;t: and at length, out of the abundance of his heart, I doubt not with many tears, he at la&s;t cries out, "God be merciful to me a &s;inner." Not, God be mer|ciful to yonder proud Phari&s;ee: he found enough in him&s;elf to vent his re&s;entment again&s;t, without looking abroad upon others. Not, God be mer|ciful to me a &s;aint; for he knew all his righteou&s;|ne&s;&s;es were but filthy rags. Not, God be merci|ful to &s;uch or &s;uch a one; but, God be merciful to me, even to me a &s;inner, a &s;inner by birth, a
<PB N="156" REF="029886_0151_0FE2C1410ADDC8B8">
&s;inner in thought, word, and deed; a &s;inner as to my per&s;on, a &s;inner as to all my performances; a &s;inner in whom is no health, in whom dwelleth no good thing; a &s;inner, poor, mi&s;erable, blind, and naked, from the crown of the head to the &s;ole of the feet, full of wounds, and brui&s;es, and putrify|ing &s;ores; a &s;elf-accu&s;ed, &s;elf-condemned &s;inner. What think you? would this Publican have been offended if any mini&s;ter had told him that he de|&s;erved to be damned? would he have been angry, if any one had told him, that by nature he was half a devil and half a bea&s;t? No: he would have confe&s;&s;ed a thou&s;and hells to have been his due, and that he was an earthly, devili&s;h &s;inner. He felt now what a dreadful thing it was to depart from the living God: he felt that he was inexcu&s;|able every way; that he could in no wi&s;e, upon account of any thing in him&s;elf, be ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God; and therefore lays him&s;elf at the feet of &s;overeign mercy, "God be merciful to me a &s;inner." Here is no confidence in the fle&s;h, no plea fetched from fa&s;ting, paying tithes, or the performance of any other duty; here is no boa&s;t|ing that he was not an extortioner, unju&s;t, or an adulterer. Perhaps he had been guilty of all the&s;e crimes, at lea&s;t he knew he would have been guilty of all the&s;e, had he been left to follow the devices and de&s;ires of his own heart; and therefore, with a broken and contrite &s;pirit, he cries out, "God be merciful to me a &s;inner."</P>
<P>This man came up to the temple to pray, and he prayed indeed. And a broken and contrite heart God will not de&s;pi&s;e. I tell you, &s;ays our Lord, I who lay in the bo&s;om of the Father from all eternity; I who am God, and therefore know all things; I who can neither deceive, nor be de|ceived,

who&s;e judgment is according to right; I tell you, whatever you may think of it, or of me for telling you &s;o, this man, this Publican, this de&s;pi&s;ed, &s;inful, but broken-hearted man, went down to his hou&s;e ju&s;tified (acquitted, and looked upon as righteous in the &s;ight of God) rather than the other.</P>
<P>Let Phari&s;ees take heed that they do not per|vert this text; for when it is &s;aid, "this man went down to his hou&s;e ju&s;tified rather than the other," our Lord does not mean that both were ju&s;tified, and that the Publican had rather more ju&s;tification than the Phari&s;ee: but it implies, either that the Publican was actually ju&s;tified, but the Phari&s;ee was not; or, that the Publican was in a better way to receive ju&s;tification, than the Phari&s;ee; according to our Lord's &s;aying, "the Publicans and harlots enter into the kingdom of heaven before you." That the Phari&s;ee was not ju&s;tified is certain, for God re&s;i&s;teth the proud; and that the Publican was at this time actually ju&s;tified (and perhaps went home with a &s;en&s;e of it in his heart) we have great rea&s;on to infer from the latter part of the text, "For every one that exalteth him&s;elf &s;hall be aba&s;ed, and he that hum|bleth him&s;elf &s;hall be exalted."</P>
<P>The parable therefore now &s;peaks to all who hear me this day: for that our Lord intended it for our learning, is evident, from his making &s;uch a general application; "for every one that exalt|eth him&s;elf &s;hall be aba&s;ed, and he that humbleth him&s;elf &s;hall be exalted."</P>
<P>The parable of the Publican and Phari&s;ee, is but as it were a gla&s;s, wherein we may &s;ee the dif|ferent di&s;po&s;ition of all mankind; for all mankind

And we may add al&s;o, that the different reception the&s;e men met with, points out to us in lively co|lours, the different treatment the &s;elf-ju&s;ticiary and &s;elf-condemned criminal will meet with at the terrible day of judgment; "Every one that ex|alts him&s;elf &s;hall be aba&s;ed, but he that humbleth him&s;elf &s;hall be exalted."</P>
<P>Every one, without exception, young or old, high or low, rich or poor (for God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons) every one, who&s;oever he be, that ex|alteth him&s;elf, and not free grace; every one that tru&s;teth in him&s;elf that he is righteous, that re&s;ts in his duties; or thinks to join them with the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God, though he be no adulterer, no extortioner, though he be not outwardly unju&s;t, nay, though he la&s;t twice in the week, and gives tithes of all that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; yet &s;hall he be aba|&s;ed in the &s;ight of all good men who know him here, and before men and angels, and God him|&s;elf, when Je&s;us Chri&s;t comes to appear in judg|ment hereafter.

you this day, that God &s;hall vi&s;it you with all his &s;torms, and pour all the vials of his wrath upon your rebellious heads; you exalted your|&s;elves here, and God &s;hall aba&s;e you hereafter; you are as proud as the devil, and with devils &s;hall you dwell to all eternity.

<P>THESE words contain part of a gracious pro|mi&s;e, which the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us was plea&s;ed to make to his weeping and &s;orrowful di&s;ciples. The time was now drawing near, in which the Son of man was fir&s;t to be lifted upon the cro&s;s, and after|wards to heaven. Kind, wondrous kind! had this merciful High-prie&s;t been to his di&s;ciples, during the time of his tabernacling among&s;t them. He had compa&s;&s;ion on their infirmities, an&s;wered for them when a&s;&s;aulted by their enemies, and fet them right when out of the way, either in princi|ple or practice.

The thoughts of parting with &s;o dear and

loving a ma&s;ter as this, e&s;pecially for a long &s;ea&s;on, mu&s;t needs affect them much. When on a cer|tain occa&s;ion he intended to be ab&s;ent from them only for a night; we are told, he was obliged to con&s;train them to leave him; no wonder then, that when he now informed them he mu&s;t entirely go away, and that the Phari&s;ees in his ab&s;ence would put them out of their &s;ynagogues, and excom|municate them; yea, that the time &s;hould come, that who&s;oever killed them, would think they did God &s;ervice (a prophecy, one would imagine, in an e&s;pecial manner de&s;igned for the &s;uffering mini&s;|ters of this generation;) no wonder, I &s;ay, con&s;id|ering all this that we are told, ver. 6.

The per&s;on referred to in the words of the text, is plainly the Comforter, the Holy Gho&s;t; and the promi&s;e was fir&s;t made to our Lord's apo&s;tles. But though it was primarily made to them, and was literally and remarkably fulfilled at the day of Penteco&s;t, when the Holy Gho&s;t came down as a mighty ru&s;hing wind, and al&s;o when three thou&s;|and were pricked to the heart by Peter's preach|ing; yet, as the apo&s;tles were the repre&s;entatives of the whole body of believers, we mu&s;t infer, that this promi&s;e mu&s;t be looked upon as &s;poken to us, and to our children, and to as many as the Lord our God &s;hall call.</P>
<P>My de&s;ign from the&s;e words, is to &s;hew the manner in which the Holy Gho&s;t generally works upon the hearts of tho&s;e, who, through grace, are made ve&s;&s;els of mercy, and tran&s;lated from the kingdom of darkne&s;s, into the kingdom of God's dear Son.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, generally: for as God is a &s;overeign agent, his &s;acred Spirit bloweth not only on whom, out when and how it li&s;teth. Therefore, far he it from me to confine the Almighty to one way of acting: or &s;ay, that all undergo an equal degree of conviction; no, there is a holy variety in God's methods of calling home his elect. But this we may affirm a&s;&s;uredly, that, wherever there is a work of true conviction and conver&s;ion wrought upon a &s;inner's heart, the Holy Gho&s;t, whether by a greater or le&s;s degree of inward &s;oul-trouble, does that which our Lord Je&s;us told the di&s;ciples, in the words of the text, that he &s;hould do when he came.</P>
<P>If any of you ridicule inward religion, or think there is no &s;uch thing as our feeling or receiving the Holy Gho&s;t, I fear my preaching will be quite
<PB N="166" REF="029886_0161_0FE2C1EE944C0F68">
fooli&s;hne&s;s to you, and that you will under&s;tand me no more than if I &s;poke to you in an unknown tongue. But as the promi&s;e in the text is made to the world, and as I know it will be fulfilling till time &s;hall be no more, I &s;hall proceed to explain the general way whereby the Holy Gho&s;t works upon every converted &s;inner's heart; and I hope that the Lord, even whil&s;t I am &s;peaking, will be plea&s;ed to fulfil it in many of your hearts. "And when he is come, he will reprove the world of &s;in, of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of judgment."</P>
<P>The word which we tran&s;late reprove, ought to be rendered convince; and in the original it im|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">es a conviction by way of argumentation, and coming with a power upon the mind equal to a demon&s;tration. A great many &s;coffers of the&s;e la&s;t days, will a&s;k &s;uch as they term pretenders to the Spirit, how they feel the Spirit, and how they know the Spirit? They might as well a&s;k, how they know, and how they feel the &s;un when it &s;hines upon the body? For with equal power and demon&s;tration does the Spirit of God work upon and convince the &s;oul. And,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It convinces of &s;in; and generally of &s;ome enormous &s;in, the wor&s;t perhaps the convicted per|&s;on ever was guilty of. Thus, when our Lord was conver&s;ing with the woman of Samaria, he convinced her fir&s;t of her adultery: "Woman, go call thy hu&s;band. The woman an&s;wered, and &s;aid, I have no hu&s;band. Je&s;us &s;aid unto her, Thou ha&s;t well &s;aid, I have no hu&s;band: for thou ha&s;t had five hu&s;bands, and he whom thou now ha&s;t, is not thy hu&s;band; in this &s;aid&s;t thou truly." With this, there went &s;uch a powerful conviction of all her other actual &s;ins, that &s;oon after, &s;he "left her water pot, and went her way into the city, and
<PB N="167" REF="029886_0162_0FE2C2863905AFD0">
&s;aith to the men, Come, and &s;ee a man that told me all things that ever I did: Is not this the Chri&s;t?" Thus our Lord al&s;o dealt with the per|&s;ecutor Saul: he convinced him fir&s;t of the horrid &s;in of per&s;ecution; "Saul, Saul, why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me?" Such a &s;en&s;e of all his other &s;ins, pro|bably at the &s;ame time revived in his mind, that immediately he died; that is, died to all his fal&s;e confidences, and was thrown into &s;uch an agony of &s;oul, that he continued three days, and neither did eat nor drink. This is the method the Spirit of God generally takes in dealing with &s;inners; he fir&s;t convinces them of &s;ome heinous actual &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and at the &s;ame time brings all their other &s;ins into remembrance, and as it were &s;ets them in battle|array before them: "When he is come, he will reprove the world of &s;in."</P>
<P>And was it ever thus with you, my dear hearers? (For I mu&s;t que&s;tion you as I go along&punc; becau&s;e I intend, by the divine help, to preach not only to your heads, but your hearts.) Did the Spirit of God ever bring all your &s;ins thus to remembrance, and make you cry out to God, "thou write&s;t bit|ter things again&s;t me?" Did your actual &s;ins ever appear before you, as though drawn in a map? If not, you have great rea&s;on (unle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> you were &s;ancti|fied from the womb) to &s;u&s;pect th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> you are not convicted, much more not converted, and that the promi&s;e of the text was never yet fulfilled in your hearts.</P>
<P>Farther: When the Comforter comes into a &s;inner's heart, though it generally convinces the &s;inner of his actual &s;in fir&s;t, yet it leads him to &s;ee and bewail his original &s;in, the fountain from which all the&s;e polluted &s;treams do flow.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="029886_0163_0FE2C1F6D3450390">
Though every thing in the earth, air and water; every thing both without and within, concur to prove the truth of that a&s;&s;ertion in the &s;cripture, "in Adam we all have died;" yet mo&s;t are &s;o hardened through the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in, that not|with&s;tanding they may give an a&s;&s;ent to the truth of the propo&s;ition in their heads, yet they never felt it really in their hearts. Nay, &s;ome in words profe&s;&s;edly deny it, though their works, too, too plainly prove them to be degenerate &s;ons of a de|generate father. But when the Comforter, the Spirit of God arre&s;ts a &s;inner, and convinces him of &s;in, all carnal rea&s;oning again&s;t original corrup|tion, every proud and high imagination, which exalteth it&s;elf again&s;t that doctrine, is immediately thrown down; and he is made to cry out, "Who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death?" He now finds that concupi&s;ence is &s;in; and does not &s;o much bewail his actual &s;ins, as the inward perver&s;e|ne&s;s of his heart, which he now finds not only to be an enemy to, but al&s;o direct enmity again&s;t God.</P>
<P>And did the Comforter, my dear friends, ever come with &s;uch a convincing power as this into your hearts? Were you ever made to &s;ee and feel, that in your fle&s;h dwelleth no good thing; that you are conceived and born in &s;in; that you are by nature children of wrath; that God would be ju&s;t if he damned you, though you never commit|ted an actual &s;in in your lives? So often as you have been at church and &s;acrament, did you ever feelingly confe&s;s, that there was no health in you; that the remembrance of your original and actual &s;ins was grievous unto you, and the burden of them intolerable? If not, you have been only of|fering to God vain oblations; you never yet pray|ed in your lives, the Comforter never yet came ef|fectually
<PB N="169" REF="029886_0164_0FE2C28AF44D9660">
into your &s;ouls; con&s;equently you are not in the faith properly &s;o called; no, you are at pre&s;ent in a &s;tate of death and damnation.</P>
<P>Again, the Comforter, when he comes effectu|ally to work upon a &s;inner, not only convinces him of the &s;in of his nature, and the &s;in of his life, but al&s;o of the &s;in of his duties.</P>
<P>We all naturally are legali&s;ts, thinking to be ju&s;tified by the works of the law. When &s;ome|what awakened by the terrors of the Lord, we im|mediately, like the Phari&s;ees of old, go about to e&s;tabli&s;h our own righteou&s;ne&s;s, and think we &s;hall, find acceptance with God, if we &s;eek it with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ears; finding our&s;elves damned by nature and our actual &s;ins, we then think to recommend our&s;elves to God by our duties, and hope, by our doings of one kind or another, to inherit eternal life. But, whenever the Comforter comes into the heart, it convinces the &s;oul of the&s;e fal&s;e re&s;ts, and makes the &s;inner to &s;ee that all his righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es are but as filthy rags; that his be&s;t works are but &s;o ma|ny &s;plendid &s;ins; and that, for the mo&s;t pompous &s;ervices, he de&s;erves no better doom than that of the unprofitable &s;ervant, to be thrown into out|er darkne&s;s, where is weeping, and wailing, and gna&s;hing of teeth.</P>
<P>And was this degree of conviction ever wrought in any of your &s;ouls? Did the Comforter ever come into your hearts, &s;o as to make you &s;ick of your duties, as well as your &s;ins? Were you ever, with the great apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, made to ab|hor your own righteou&s;ne&s;s which is by the law, and acknowledge that you de&s;erve to be damned, though you &s;hould give all your goods to &s;eed the poor? Were you made to feel, that your very re|pentance needed to be repented of, and that every
<PB N="170" REF="029886_0165_0FE2C1FBB3F8A448">
thing in your&s;elves is but dung and dro&s;s? And that all the arguments you can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">etch for mercy, mu&s;t be out of the heart and pure unmerited love of God? Were you ever made to lie at the feet of &s;overeign grace, and to &s;ay, Lord if thou wilt, thou may'&s;t &s;ave me; if not, thou may'&s;t ju&s;tly damn me; I have nothing to plead, I can in no wi&s;e ju&s;tify my&s;elf in thy &s;ight; my be&s;t perfor|mances, I &s;ee will condemn me; and all I have to depend upon is thy free grace? What &s;ay you? Was this ever, or is this now, the habitual language of your hearts? You have been frequently at the temple; but did you ever approach it in the tem|per of the poor publican; and, after you have done all&punc; acknowledge that you have done nothing; and upon a feeling experimental &s;en&s;e of your own unworthine&s;s and &s;infulne&s;s every way, &s;mite upon your brea&s;ts, and &s;ay, "God be merciful to us &s;in|ners?" If you never were thus minded, the Comforter never yet effectually came into your &s;ouls, you are out of Chri&s;t; and if God &s;hould require your &s;ouls in that condition, he would be no better to you than a con&s;uming &s;ire.</P>
<P>But there is a fourth &s;in, of which the comfort|er, when he comes convinces the &s;oul, and which alone (it is very remarkable) our Lord mentions as though it was the only &s;in worth mentioning; for indeed it is the root of all other &s;ins what&s;o|ever: It is the reigning as well as the damning &s;in of the world. And what now do you imagine that &s;in may be? It is that cur&s;ed &s;in, that root of all other evils, I mean the &s;in of unbelief. "Of &s;in, becau&s;e they believe not on me."</P>
<P>But does the Chri&s;tian world, or any of you that hear me this day, want the Holy Gho&s;t to con|vince you of unbelief? Are there any infidels
<PB N="171" REF="029886_0166_0FE2C29271F77930">
here? Yes (O that I had not too great rea&s;on to think &s;o) I fear mo&s;t are &s;uch: Not indeed &s;uch infidels as profe&s;&s;edly deny the Lord that bought us (though I fear too many even of &s;uch mon&s;ters are in every country) but I mean &s;uch unbelievers that have no more faith in Chri&s;t than the devils them&s;elves. Perhaps you may think you believe, becau&s;e you repeat the creed, or &s;ub&s;cribe to a confe&s;&s;ion of faith; becau&s;e you go to church or meeting, receive the &s;acrament, and are taken in|to full communion. The&s;e are ble&s;&s;ed privileges; but all this may be done without our being true believers. And I know not how to detect your fal&s;e hypocritical faith better, than by putting to you this que&s;tion, How long have you believed? Would not mo&s;t of you &s;ay, as long as we can remember, we never did di&s;believe. Then this is a certain &s;ign that you have no true faith at all: No, not &s;o much as a grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed: For if you believe now (unle&s;s you were &s;anctified from your infancy, which is the ca&s;e of &s;ome) you mu&s;t know that there was a time in which you did not believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and the Holy Gho&s;t, if ever you received it, convinced you of this. Eternal truth has declared, "when he is come he will convince the world of &s;in, becau&s;e they believe not on me."</P>
<P>None of us believe by nature: But after the Holy Gho&s;t has convinced us of the &s;in of our na|tures, and the &s;in of our lives and duties, in order to convince us of our utter inability to &s;ave our|&s;elves, and that we mu&s;t be beholden to God, as for every thing el&s;e, &s;o for faith (without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e, or be &s;aved by Chri&s;t) he convinces us al&s;o that we have no faith. Do&s;t thou believe on the Son of God? is the grand que&s;tion
<PB N="172" REF="029886_0167_0FE2C2022D4D80F0">
which the Holy Gho&s;t now puts to the &s;oul: At the &s;ame time he works with &s;uch power and de|mon&s;trations, that the &s;oul &s;ees, and is obliged to confe&s;s, that it has no faith.</P>
<P>This is a thing little thought of by mo&s;t who call them&s;elves believers. They dream they are Chri&s;tians becau&s;e they live in a Chri&s;tian country: If they were born Turks, they would believe on Mahomet; for what is that which men common|ly call faith, but an outward con&s;ent to the e&s;tab|li&s;hed religion? But do not you thus deceive your own&s;elves; true faith is quite another thing. A&s;k your&s;elves, therefore, whether or not the Holy Gho&s;t ever powerfully convinced you of the &s;in of unbelief? You are perhaps &s;o devout (you may imagine) as to get a catalogue of &s;ins, which you look over, and confe&s;s in a formal manner, as often as you go to the holy &s;acrament: But among all your &s;ins, did you ever once confe&s;s and bewail that damning &s;in of unbelief? Were you ever made to cry out, Lord, give me faith; Lord, give me to believe on thee; O that I had faith! O that I could believe! If you never were thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, at lea&s;t, if you never &s;aw and felt, that you had no faith, it is a certain &s;ign that the Holy Gho&s;t the Comforter, never came into and worked &s;avingly upon your &s;ouls.</P>
<P>But is it not odd, that the Holy Gho&s;t &s;hould be called a Comforter, when it is plain, by the experience of all God's children, that this work of conviction is u&s;ually attended with &s;ore inward conflicts, and a great deal of &s;oul-trouble? I an|&s;wer, the Holy Gho&s;t may well be termed a Com|forter, even in this work; becau&s;e it is the only way to, and ends in, true &s;olid comfort. Ble&s;&s;ed are they that are thus convicted by him; for they
<PB N="173" REF="029886_0168_0FE2C297C8A954B8">
&s;hall be comforted. Nay, not only &s;o, but there is pre&s;ent comfort, even in the mid&s;t of the&s;e con|victions: The &s;oul &s;ecretly rejoices in the &s;ight of its own mi&s;ery, ble&s;&s;es God for bringing it out of darkne&s;s into light, and looks forward with a com|fortable pro&s;pect of future deliverances, knowing, that 'though &s;orrow may endure for a night, joy will come in the morning."</P>
<P>Thus it is that the Holy Gho&s;t convinces the &s;oul of &s;in. And, if &s;o, how wretchedly are they mi&s;taken, that blend the light of the Spirit with the light of con&s;cience, as all &s;uch do, who &s;ay, that Chri&s;t lighteth every man that cometh into the world, and that light, if improved, will bring us to Je&s;us Chri&s;t? If &s;uch doctrine be true, the promi&s;e in the text was needle&s;s: Our Lord's apo&s;tles had already that light; the world hereaf|ter to be convinced, had that light; and, if that was &s;ufficient to bring them to Chri&s;t, why was it expedient that Chri&s;t &s;hould go away to heaven, to &s;end down the Holy Gho&s;t to do this for them? Alas! all have not this Spirit: It is the &s;pecial gift of God, and, without this &s;pecial gift, we can never come to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The light of con&s;cience will accu&s;e or convince us of any common &s;in; but the light of natural con&s;cience never did, never will, and never can convince us of unbelief. If it could, how comes it to pa&s;s, that not one of the heathens, who im|proved the light of nature in &s;uch an eminent de|gree, was ever convinced of unbelief? No, natu|ral con&s;cience cannot effect this; it is the peculiar property of the Holy Gho&s;t the Comforter: "When he is come, he will reprove (or convince) the world of &s;in, of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and judgment."</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="029886_0169_0FE2C206DC6E7910">
We have heard how he convinces of &s;in: We come now to &s;hew,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> What is the righteou&s;ne&s;s, of which the Comforter convinces the world?</P>
<P>By the word <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> in &s;ome places of &s;cripture, we are to under&s;tand that common ju&s;|tice which we ought to practice between man and man; as when Paul is &s;aid to rea&s;on of temper|ance and righteou&s;ne&s;s before a trembling Felix. But here (as in a multitude of other places in ho|ly writ) we are to under&s;tand by the word righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, the active and pa&s;&s;ive obedience of the dear Lord Je&s;us; even that perfect, per&s;onal, all|&s;ufficient righteou&s;ne&s;s, which he has wrought out for that world which the Spirit is to convince. "Of righteou&s;ne&s;s (&s;ays our Lord) becau&s;e I go to the Father, and ye &s;ee me no more." This is one argument that the Holy Spirit makes u&s;e of to prove Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, becau&s;e he is gone to the Father, and we &s;ee him no more. For had he not wrought out a &s;ufficient righteou&s;ne&s;s, the Father would have &s;ent him back, as not having done what he undertook; and we &s;hould have &s;een him again.</P>
<P>O the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t! It &s;o comforts my &s;oul, that I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed if I mention it in almo&s;t all my di&s;cour&s;es. I would not, if I could help it, have one &s;ermon without it. What|ever infidels may object, or Arminians &s;ophi&s;tical|ly argue again&s;t an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s; yet whoever know them&s;elves and God, mu&s;t acknow|ledge, that "Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s (and perfect ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God) to every one that believeth," and that we are to be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him. This, and this only, a poor &s;inner can
<PB N="175" REF="029886_0170_0FE2C29F91251578">
lay hold of, as a &s;ure anchor of his hope. What|ever other &s;cheme of &s;alvation men may lay, I ac|knowledge I can &s;ee no other foundation whereon to build my hopes of &s;alvation, but on the rock of Chri&s;t's per&s;onal righteou&s;ne&s;s, imputed to my &s;oul.</P>
<P>Many, I believe, have a rational conviction of, and agree with me in this: But rational convic|tions, if re&s;ted in, avail but little; it mu&s;t be a &s;piritual, experimental conviction of the truth which is &s;aving. And therefore our Lord &s;ays, when the Holy Gho&s;t comes in the day of his power, it convinces of this righteou&s;ne&s;s, of the reality, completene&s;s and &s;ufficiency of it, to &s;ave a poor &s;inner.</P>
<P>We have &s;een how the Holy Gho&s;t convinces the &s;inner of the &s;in of his nature, life, duties, and of the &s;in of unbelief, and what then mu&s;t the poor crea|ture do? He mu&s;t, he mu&s;t inevitably de&s;pair, if there be no hope but in him&s;elf. When there|fore the Spirit has hunted the &s;inner out of all his fal&s;e re&s;ts and hiding-places, taken off the pitiful fig-leaves of his own works, and driven him out of the trees of the garden (his outward reformations) and placed him naked before the bar of a &s;over|eign, holy, ju&s;t, and &s;in-avenging God; then&punc; then it is, when the &s;oul, having the &s;entence of death within it&s;elf becau&s;e of unbelief, has a &s;weet di&s;|play of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s made to it by the holy Spirit of God. Here it is, that he begins more immediately to act in the quality of a Com|forter, and convinces the &s;oul &s;o powerfully of the reality and all-&s;ufficiency of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, that the &s;oul is immediately &s;et a hungering and thir&s;ting after it. Now the &s;inner begins to &s;ee, that though he has de&s;troyed him&s;elf, yet in Chri&s;t
<PB N="176" REF="029886_0171_0FE2C20EACAF50D8">
is his help; that, though he has no righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own to recommend him, there is a fulne&s;s of grace, a fulne&s;s of truth, a fulne&s;s of righteou&s;|ne&s;s in the dear Lord Je&s;us, which, if once impu|ted to him, would make him happy for ever and ever.</P>
<P>None can tell, but tho&s;e happy &s;ouls who have experienced it, with what demon&s;tration of the Spirit this conviction comes. O how amiable, as well as all-&s;ufficient, does the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us now appear! With what new eyes does the &s;oul now &s;ee the Lord its righteou&s;ne&s;s! Brethren, it is un|utterable. If you were never thus convinced of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s in your own &s;ouls, though you may believe it doctrinally, it will avail you nothing; if the Comforter never came &s;avingly into your &s;ouls, then you are comfortle&s;s indeed. But</P>
<P>What will this righteou&s;ne&s;s avail, if the &s;oul has it not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The next thing therefore the Comfort|er, when he comes, convinces the &s;oul of, is judgment.</P>
<P>By the word <HI>judgment</HI> I under&s;tand, that well|grounded peace, that &s;ettled judgment, which the &s;oul forms of it&s;elf, when it is enabled by the Spi|rit of God to lay hold on Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, which I believe it always does, when convinced in the manner before-mentioned. "Of judgment (&s;ays our Lord) becau&s;e the Prince of this world is judged;" the &s;oul, being enabled to lay hold on Chri&s;t's perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s by a lively faith, has a conviction wrought in it by the Holy Spirit, that the "Prince of this world is judged." The &s;oul being now ju&s;tified by faith, has peace with God, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and can trium|phantly
<PB N="177" REF="029886_0172_0FE2C2A441F25E08">
&s;ay, it is Chri&s;t that ju&s;tifies me, who is he that condemns me? The &s;trong man armed is now ca&s;t out; my &s;oul is in a true peace; the Prince of this world will come and accu&s;e, but he has now no &s;hare in me: The ble&s;&s;ed Spirit which I have received, and whereby I am enabled to ap|ply Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s to my poor &s;oul, power|fully convinces me of this: Why &s;hould I fear? Or of what &s;hall I be afraid, &s;ince God's Spirit witne&s;&s;es with my &s;pirit, that I am a child of God? The Lord is a&s;cended up on high; he has led captivity captive; he has received the Holy Gho&s;t the Comforter, that be&s;t of gifts for men: and that Comforter is come into my heart: he is faith|ful that hath promi&s;ed: I, even I am powerfully, rationally, &s;piritually convicted of &s;in, righteou&s;|ne&s;s and judgment. By this I know the prince of this world is judged.</P>
<P>Thus, I &s;ay, may we &s;uppo&s;e that &s;oul to tri|umph, in which the promi&s;e of the text is happily fulfilled. And though, at the beginning of this di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;aid, mo&s;t had never experienced any thing of this, and that therefore this preaching mu&s;t be fooli&s;hne&s;s to &s;uch; yet I doubt not but there are &s;ome few happy &s;ouls, who, through grace, have been enabled to follow me &s;tep by &s;tep and notwith&s;tanding the Holy Gho&s;t might not directly work in the &s;ame order as I have de|&s;cribed, and perhaps they cannot exactly &s;ay the time when, yet they have a w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll grounded confi|dence that the work is done, and that they have really been convinced of &s;in, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and judgment, in &s;ome way, or at &s;ome time or a|nother.</P>
<P>And now what &s;hall I &s;ay to you? O thank God, thank the Lord Je&s;us, thank the ever ble&s;&s;|ed
<PB N="178" REF="029886_0173_0FE2C21385786400">
Trinity, for this un&s;peakable gift: For you would never have been thus highly favoured, had not he who fir&s;t &s;poke darkne&s;s into light, loved you with an everla&s;ting love, and enlightened you by his Holy Spirit, and that too, not on account of any good thing fore&s;een in you, but for his own name's &s;ake.</P>
<P>Be humble therefore, O believers be humble: Look to the rock from whence you have been hewn: Extol free grace; admire electing love, which alone has made you to differ from the re&s;t of your brethren. Has God brought you into light? Walk as becometh the children of light. Provoke not the Holy Spirit to depart from you: For though he hath &s;ealed you to the day of re|demption, and you know that the Prince of this world is judged; yet if you back&s;lide, grow luke|warm, or forget your fir&s;t love, the Lord will vi&s;it your offences with the rod of affliction, and your &s;in with &s;piritual &s;courges. Be not therefore high|minded, but fear. Rejoice, but let it be with trembling. As the elect of God, put on, not on|ly humblene&s;s of mind, but bowels of compa&s;&s;ion; and pray, O pray for your unconverted brethren! Help <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, help me now, O children of God, and hold up my hands, as Aaron and Hur once held up the hands of Mo&s;es. Pray whil&s;t I am preach|ing, that the Lord may enable me to &s;ay, This day is the promi&s;e in the text fulfilled in &s;ome poor &s;inners' hearts. Cry mightily to God, and with the cords of a holy violence, pull down ble&s;s|ings on your neighbours' heads. Chri&s;t yet lives and reigns in heaven: The re&s;idue of the Spirit is yet in his hand, and a plentiful effu&s;ion of it is promi&s;ed in the latter days of the church. And O that the Holy Gho&s;t, the ble&s;&s;ed Comforter,
<PB N="179" REF="029886_0174_0FE2C2AD4C6D3E70">
would now come down, and convince tho&s;e that are Chri&s;t le&s;s among you, "of &s;in, of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and of judgment!" O that you were once made willing to be convinced!</P>
<P>But perhaps you had rather be filled with wine than with the Spirit, and are daily cha&s;ing that Holy Gho&s;t from your &s;ouls. What &s;hall I &s;ay for you to God? "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." What &s;hall I &s;ay from God to you? Why?" that God was in Chri&s;t reconciling the world unto him&s;elf:" Therefore I be&s;eech you, as in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, be ye reconciled to God. Do not go away contradicting and bla&s;|pheming. I know Satan would have you begone. Many of you may be unea&s;y, and are ready to cry out, "What a wearine&s;s is this!" But I will not let you go: I have wre&s;tled with God for my hear|ers in private, and I mu&s;t wre&s;tle with you here in public. Though of my&s;elf I can do nothing, and you can no more by your own power come to and believe on Chri&s;t, than Lazarus could come forth from the grave; yet who knows but God may beget &s;ome of you again to a lively hope by this fooli&s;hne&s;s of preaching, and that you may be &s;ome of that world, which the Comforter is to convince "of &s;in, of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of judg|ment?" Poor Chri&s;t-le&s;s &s;ouls! do you know what a condition you are in? Why, you are lying in the wicked one, the devil; he rules in you, he walks and dwells in you, unle&s;s you dwell in Chri&s;t, and the Comforter is come into your hearts. And will you contentedly lie in that wicked one the devil? What wages will he give you? Eternal death. O that you would come to Chri&s;t! The free gift of God through him is eternal life. He will accept of you even now, if you will believe in

<P>I &s;ee many of you affected: But are your pa&s;|&s;ions only a little wrought upon, or are your &s;ouls really touched with a lively &s;en&s;e of the heinou&s;ne&s;s of your &s;ins, your want of faith, and the preciou&s;|ne&s;s of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? If &s;o, I hope the Lord has been gracious, and that the Comforter is coming into your hearts. O do not &s;tifle the&s;e convictions! Do not go away, and &s;traightway forget what manner of doctrine you have heard, and thereby &s;hew that the&s;e are only common workings of a few tran&s;ient convictions, floating upon the &s;urface of your hearts. Beg of God that you may be &s;incere (for he alone can make you &s;o) and that you may indeed de&s;ire the promi&s;e of the text to be fulfilled in your &s;ouls, Who knows but the Lord may be gracious? Re|member you have no plea but &s;overeign mercy; but for your encouragement al&s;o, remember it is the world, &s;uch as you are, to whom the Comfort|er is to come, and whom he is to convince: Wait therefore at Wi&s;dom's gates. The bare probabil|ity of having a door of mercy opened, is enough to keep you &s;triving. Chri&s;t Je&s;us came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners, the chief of them: You know not but he came to &s;ave you. Do not go and quarrel with God's decrees, and &s;ay, if I am a reprobate, I &s;hall be damned; if I am elected, I &s;hall be &s;aved; and therefore I will do nothing. What have you to do with God's decrees? Secret things belong to him; it is your bu&s;ine&s;s to give "all diligence to make your calling and election

If there are but few who find the way that leads to life, do you &s;trive to be &s;ome of them: You know not but you may be in the number of tho&s;e few, and that your &s;triving may be the means which God intends to ble&s;s, to give you an entrance in. If you do not act thus, you are not &s;incere; and, if you do, who knows but you may find mercy? For though after you have done all that you can, God may ju&s;tly cut you off, yet never was a &s;ingle per&s;on damned who did all that he could. Though therefore your hands are withered, &s;tretch them out; though you are im|potent &s;ick, and lame, come lie at the pool. Who knows but by and by the Lord Je&s;us may have compa&s;&s;ion on you, and &s;end the Comforter to convince you of &s;in, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of judge|ment? He is a God full of compa&s;&s;ion and long-&s;uffering, otherwi&s;e you and I had been long &s;ince lifting up our eyes in torments. But &s;till he is pa|tient with us!</P>
<P>O Chri&s;t-le&s;s &s;inners, you are alive, and who knows but God intends to bring you to repent|ance? Could my prayers or tears effect it, you &s;hould have volleys of the one, and floods of the other. My heart is touched with a &s;en&s;e of your condition: May our merciful High-Prie&s;t now &s;end down the Comforter and make you &s;en&s;ible of it al&s;o! O the love of Chri&s;t! It con&s;trains me to be&s;eech you to come to him; what do you reject, if you reject Chri&s;t, the Lord of glory! Sinners, give the dear Redeemer a lodging in your &s;ouls. Do not be Beth&s;hemites; give Chri&s;t your hearts, your whole hearts. Indeed he is worthy. He made you and not you your&s;elves. You are not your own; give Chri&s;t then your bodies and &s;ouls, which are his! Is it not enough to melt you down,

<HEAD>THE CONVERSION OF ZACCHEUS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>LUKE xix. 9, 10.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, This day is &s;alvation come to this hou&s;e, fora&s;much as he al&s;o is the &s;on of Abra|ham. For the Son of man is come to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SALVATION, every where through the whole &s;cripture, is &s;aid to be the free gift of God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord. Not only free, becau&s;e God is a &s;overeign agent and therefore may withhold it from, or confer it on, whom he plea&s;eth; but free, becau&s;e there is nothing to be found in man, that can any way induce God to be merciful unto him. The righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the &s;ole cau&s;e of our finding favour in God's &s;ight: This righteou&s;ne&s;s apprehended by faith (which is al&s;o the gift of God) makes it our own; and this faith, if true, will work by love.</P>
<P>The&s;e are parts of tho&s;e glad tidings which are publi&s;hed in the go&s;pel; and of the certainty of them, next to the expre&s;s word of God, the ex|perience of all &s;uch as have been &s;aved, is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and as I take it, the mo&s;t undoubted proof, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> God might teach us every way, he has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to leave upon record many in&s;tances <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the power of his grace exerted in the &s;alvation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ev|eral per&s;ons, that we hearing how he dealt with

them, might from thence infer the manner we mu&s;t expect to be dealt with our&s;elves, and learn in what way we mu&s;t look for &s;alvation, if we tru|ly de&s;ire to be made partakers of the inheritance with the &s;aints in light.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ion of the per&s;on referred to in the text, I think will be of no &s;mall &s;ervice to us in this matter, if rightly improved, I would hope, mo&s;t of you know who the per&s;on is, to whom the Lord Je&s;us &s;peaks; it is the Publican Zaccheus, to who&s;e hou&s;e the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us &s;aid, &s;alvation came, and whom he pronounces a &s;on of Abraham.</P>
<P>It is my de&s;ign (God helping) to make &s;ome re|marks upon his conver&s;ion recorded at large in the preceding ver&s;es, and then to inforce the latter part of the text, as an encouragement to poor undone &s;inners to come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. "For the Son of man is come to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t."</P>
<P>The evangeli&s;t Luke introduces the account of this man's conver&s;ion thus, ver. 1. "And Je&s;us entered and pa&s;&s;ed through Jericho." The holy Je&s;us made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to go about doing good. As the &s;un in the firmament is continually &s;pread|ing his benign, quickening, and cheering influenc|es over the natural; &s;o the Son of Righteou&s;ne&s;s aro&s;e with healing under his wings, and was daily and hourly diffu&s;ing his gracious influences over the moral world. The preceeding chapter ac|quaints us of a notable miracle wrought by the holy Je&s;us on a poor blind Bartimeus; and in this, a greater pre&s;ents it&s;elf to our con&s;ideration. The evangeli&s;t would have us take particular notice of it; for he introduces it with the word behold: "And behold, there was a man named Zaccheus,
<PB N="186" REF="029886_0181_0FE2C22BC6D41BA0">
who was the chief among the Publicans, and he was rich."</P>
<P>Well might the evangeli&s;t u&s;her in the relation of this man's conver&s;ion with the word <HI>behold!</HI> For, according to human judgment, how many in&s;urmoutable ob&s;tacles lay in the way of it! Surely no one will &s;ay there was any fitne&s;s in Zaccheus for &s;alvation; for we are told that he was a Publican, and therefore in all probability a notorious &s;inner. The Publicans were gatherers of the Roman taxes; they were infamous for their abominable extortion; their very name therefore became &s;o odious, that we find the Pha|ri&s;ees often reproached our Lord, as very wicked, becau&s;e he was a friend unto and &s;at down to meat with them. Zaccheus then, being a Pub|lican, was no doubt a &s;inner; and, being chief a|mong the Publicans, con&s;equently was chief among &s;inners. Nay, he was rich. And one in&s;pired apo&s;tle has told us, that not many mighty, not many noble, are called. Another &s;aith, "God has cho&s;en the poor of this world, rich in faith." And he who was the Maker and the Redeemer of the apo&s;tles, a&s;&s;ures us, "that it is ea&s;ier for a camel (or cable-rope) to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the king|dom of God." Let not therefore the rich glory in the multitude of their riches.</P>
<P>But rich as he was, we are told, ver&s;e 3 that he &s;ought to &s;ee Je&s;us." And that was a won|der indeed! The common people heard our Lord gladly, and the poor received the go&s;pel. The multitude, the very mob, the people that kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w not the law, as the proud high-prie&s;ts called them&punc; u&s;ed to follow him on foot into the country, and &s;ometimes &s;tayed with him three days together to
<PB N="187" REF="029886_0182_0FE2C2C535F727B0">
hear him preach: But did the rich believe or at|tend on him? No. Our Lord preached up the doctrine of the cro&s;s; he preached too &s;earching for them, and therefore they counted him their enemy, per&s;ecuted and &s;poke all manner of evil again&s;t him fal&s;ely. Let not the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t marvel, if they meet with the like treat|ment from the rich men of this wicked and adul|terous generation. I &s;hould think it no &s;candal (&s;uppo&s;ing it true) to hear it affirmed, that none but the poor attended my mini&s;try. Their &s;ouls are as precious to our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the &s;ouls of the greate&s;t men. They were the poor that attended him in the days of his fle&s;h: The&s;e are they whom he hath cho&s;en to be rich in faith, and to be the greate&s;t in the kingdom of heaven. Were the rich in this world's goods generally to &s;peak well of me, woe be unto me; I &s;hould think it a dreadful &s;ign that I was only a wolf in &s;heep's cloathing, that I &s;poke peace, peace, when there was no peace and prophe&s;ied &s;moother things than the go&s;pel would allow of. Hear ye this, O ye rich. Let who will dare to do it, God forbid that I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e the poor; in doing &s;o, I &s;hould reproach my Maker. The poor are dear to my &s;oul; I rejoice to &s;ee them fly to the doctrine of Chri&s;t, like the doves to their windows. I only pray that the poor who attend, may be evangel|ized, and turned into the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel: "If &s;o, ble&s;&s;ed are ye; for yours is the kingdom of heaven."</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t return to Zaccheus. He &s;ought to &s;ee Je&s;us. This is good news. I heartily wi&s;h I could &s;ay, it was out of a good principle: But, without &s;peaking contrary to that charity which hopes and believeth all things for the be&s;t, we
<PB N="188" REF="029886_0183_0FE2C234919F98C0">
may &s;ay, that the &s;ame principle drew him after Chri&s;t, which now draws multitudes (to &s;peak plainly, it may be multitudes of you) to hear a particular preacher, even curio&s;ity: For we are told, that he came not to hear his doctrine, but to view his per&s;on, or to u&s;e the words of the evan|geli&s;t, to &s;ee who he was. Our Lord's &s;ame was now &s;pread abroad through all Jeru&s;alem, and all the country round about: Some &s;aid he was a good man; others, nay, but he deceiveth the people. And therefore curio&s;ity drew out this rich Publican Zaccheus to &s;ee who this per&s;on was, of whom he had heard &s;uch various accounts. But it &s;eems he could not conveniently get a &s;ight of him for the pre&s;s, and becau&s;e he was little of &s;tature. Alas! how many are kept from &s;eeing Chri&s;t in glory, by rea&s;on of the pre&s;s. I mean, how many are a&s;hamed of being &s;ingularly good, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> therefore follow a multitude to do evil, be|cau&s;e they have a pre&s;s or throng of polite acquain|tance! And&punc; for fear of being &s;et at nought by tho&s;e with whom they u&s;ed to &s;it at meat, they deny the Lord of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and are a&s;hamed to confe&s;s him before men. This ba&s;e, this &s;ervile fear of man, is the bane of true Chri&s;tianity; it brings a dread|ful &s;nare upon the &s;oul, and is the ruin of ten thou|&s;ands: For I am fully per&s;uaded, numbers are ra|tionally convicted of go&s;pel truths; but not being able to brook contempt, they will not pro&s;ecute their convictions, nor reduce them to practice. Happy tho&s;e, who in this re&s;pect, at lea&s;t, like Zaccheus, re&s;olved to overcome all impediments that lie in their way to a &s;ight of Chri&s;t: For find|ing he could not &s;ee Chri&s;t becau&s;e of the pre&s;s, and the littlene&s;s of his natural &s;tature, he did not &s;mite upon his brea&s;t, and depart, &s;aying, "It is
<PB N="189" REF="029886_0184_0FE2C2C9D692D6D0">
in vain to &s;eek after a &s;ight of him any longer, I can never attain unto it." No, finding he could not &s;ee Chri&s;t, if he continued in the mid&s;t of the pre&s;s, "he ran before the multitude; and climbed up into a &s;ycamore tree, to &s;ee him; for he was to pa&s;s that way&punc;"</P>
<P>There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eeing Chri&s;t in glory, unle&s;s we run before the multitude, and are willing to be in the number of tho&s;e de&s;pi&s;ed few, who take the king|dom of God by violence. The broad way in which &s;o many go, can never be that &s;traight and narrow way which leads to life. Our Lord's flock was, and always will be, comparatively a little one: And unle&s;s we dare to run before the multitude in a holy &s;ingularity, and can rejoice in being ac|counted fools for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, we &s;hall never &s;ee Je&s;us with comfort, when he appears in glory. From mentioning the &s;ycamore-tree, and con&s;id|ering the difficulty with which Zaccheus mu&s;t climb it, we may farther learn, that tho&s;e who would &s;ee Chri&s;t, mu&s;t undergo other difficulties and hard|&s;hips, be&s;ides contempt. Zaccheus, without doubt went through both. Did not many, think you, laugh at him as he ran along, and in the language of Michal, Saul's daughter, cry out, how glori|ous did the rich Zacheus look to-day, when, for|getting, the greatne&s;s of his &s;tation, he ran before a pitiful, giddy mob, and climbed a &s;ycamore-tree, to &s;ee an enthu&s;ia&s;tic preacher! But Zaccheus cares not for all that; his curio&s;ity was &s;trong: If he could but &s;ee who Je&s;us was, he did not value what &s;coffers &s;aid of him. Thus, and much more will it be with all tho&s;e who have an effectual de|&s;ire to &s;ee Je&s;us in heaven: They will go on from &s;trength to &s;trength, break through every difficul|ty lying in their way, and care not what men or
<PB N="190" REF="029886_0185_0FE2C239300073C0">
devils &s;ay of or do unto them. May the Lord make us all thus minded, for his dear Son's &s;ake!</P>
<P>At length, after taking much pains, and going (as we may well &s;uppo&s;e) through much contempt, Zaccheus has climbed the tree; and there he &s;its, as he thinks, hid in the leaves of it, and watching when he &s;hould &s;ee Je&s;us pa&s;s by: "For he was to pa&s;s by that way."</P>
<P>But &s;ing, O heavens, and rejoice, O earth! Prai&s;e magnify, and adore &s;overeign, electing, free, preventing love; Je&s;us the everla&s;ting God, the Prince of peace, who &s;aw Nathaniel under the fig tree, and Zaccheus from eternity, now &s;ees him in the &s;ycamore-tree, and calls him in time.</P>
<P>Ver, 5. "And when Je&s;us came to the place, he looked up, and &s;aw him, and &s;aid unto him, Zaccheus, make ha&s;te and come down; for this day I mu&s;t abide at thy hou&s;e." Amazing love! Well might Luke u&s;her in the account with be|hold! It is worthy of our highe&s;t admiration. When Zaccheus thought of no &s;uch thing, nay, thought that Chri&s;t Je&s;us did not know him; be|hold, Chri&s;t does what we never hear he did be|fore or after, I mean, invite him&s;elf to the hou&s;e of Zaccheus, &s;aying, "Zaccheus make ha&s;te and come down; for this day I mu&s;t abide at thy hou&s;e." Not pray let me abide, but I mu&s;t abide this day at thy hou&s;e. He al&s;o calls him by name, as though he was well acquainted with him: and indeed well he might; for his name was written in the book of life, he was one of tho&s;e whom the Father had given him from all eternity: therefore he mu&s;t abide at his hou&s;e that day. "For whom he did prede&s;tinate, them he al&s;o called."</P>
<P>Here then, as through a gla&s;s, we may &s;ee the doctrine of free grace evidently exemplified before
<PB N="191" REF="029886_0186_0FE2C2D078232F70">
us. Here was no fitne&s;s in Zaccheus. He was a Publican, chief among the Publicans; not only &s;o, but rich, and came to &s;ee Chri&s;t only out of curio&s;ity: but &s;overeign grace triumphs over all. And if we do God ju&s;tice, and are effectually wrought upon, we mu&s;t acknowledge there was no more fitne&s;s in us than in Zaccheus; and, had not Chri&s;t prevented us by his call, we had remained dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, and alienated from the divine life, even as others. "Je&s;us looked up, and &s;aw him, and &s;aid unto him, Zaccheus, make ha&s;te and come down; for this day I mu&s;t abide at thy hou&s;e."</P>
<P>With what different emotions of heart may we &s;uppo&s;e Zaccheus received this invitation? Think you not that he was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear Je&s;us Chri&s;t call him by name, and not only &s;o, but invite him|&s;elf to his hou&s;e? Surely, thinks Zaccheus, I dream: it cannot be; how &s;hould he know me? I never &s;aw him before: be&s;ides, I &s;hall undergo much contempt, if I receive him under my roof. Thus, I &s;ay, we may &s;uppo&s;e Zaccheus thought within him&s;elf. But what &s;aith the &s;cripture? "I will make a willing people in the day of my power." With this outward call, there went an efficacious power from God, which &s;weetly over-ruled his natural will: and therefore, ver&s;e 6. "He made ha&s;te, and came down, and received him joyfully," not only into his hou&s;e, but al&s;o into his heart.</P>
<P>Thus it is the great God brings home his chil|dren. He calls them by name, by his word or providence; he &s;peaks to them al&s;o by his Spirit. Hereby they are enabled to open their hearts, and are made willing to receive the King of glory, For Zaccheus' &s;ake, let us not entirely condemn people that come unto the word, out of no better
<PB N="192" REF="029886_0187_0FE2C24015396538">
principle than curio&s;ity. Who knows, but God may call them? It is good to be where the Lord is pa&s;&s;ing by. May all who are now pre&s;ent out of this principle, hear the voice of the Son of God &s;peaking to their &s;ouls; and &s;o hear that they may live! Not that men ought therefore to take en|couragement to come out of curio&s;ity. For per|haps a thou&s;and more, at other times, came to &s;ee Chri&s;t out of curio&s;ity, as well as Zaccheus, who were not effectually called by his grace. I only mention this for the encouragement of my own &s;oul, and the con&s;olation of God's children, who are too apt to be angry with tho&s;e who do not at|tend on the word out of love to God: but let them alone. Brethren, pray for them. How do you know but Je&s;us Chri&s;t may &s;peak to their hearts? A few words from Chri&s;t applied by his Spirit, will &s;ave their &s;ouls. "Zaccheus, &s;ays Chri&s;t, make ha&s;te and come down. And he made ha&s;te, and came down, and received him joyfully."</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved in holy &s;cripture, how particu|larly it is remarked, that per&s;ons rejoiced upon be|lieving in Chri&s;t. Thus the converted Eunuch went on his way rejoicing; thus the jailor rejoiced with his whole hou&s;e; thus Zaccheus received Chri&s;t joyfully. And well may tho&s;e rejoice who receive Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for with him they receive righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification, and eternal redemp|tion. Many have brought up an ill report upon our good land, and would fain per&s;uade people that religion will make them melancholy mad. So far from it, that joy is one ingredient of the kingdom of God in the heart of a believer; "the kingdom of God is righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t." To rejoice in the Lord, is a go&s;pel duty. Rejoice in the Lord always, and
<PB N="193" REF="029886_0188_0FE2C2D55D881EA0">
again I &s;ay, rejoice. And who can be &s;o joyful, as tho&s;e who know that their pardon is &s;ealed be|fore they go hence and are no more &s;een? The godly may, but I cannot &s;ee how any ungodly men can rejoice: they cannot be truly cheerful. What if wicked men may &s;ometimes have laugh|ter among&s;t them? It is only the laughter of fools; in the mid&s;t of it there is heavine&s;s; at the be&s;t, it is but like the crackling of thorns under a pot: It makes a blaze, but &s;oon goes out. But, as for the godly, it is not &s;o with them; their joy is &s;ol|id and la&s;ting. As it is a joy that a &s;tranger in|termeddleth not with, &s;o it is a joy that no man taketh from them, it is a joy in God, a joy un|&s;peakable and full of glory.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem that Zaccheus was under &s;oul-di&s;tre&s;s but a little while; "perhaps," &s;ays Guth|rie, in his book intitled, The trial concerning a &s;aving intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, "not above a quarter of an hour;" I add, perhaps not &s;o long: For as one ob&s;erves, &s;ometimes the Lord Je&s;us delights to de|liver &s;peedily. God is a &s;overeign agent, and works upon his children in their effectual calling, according to the coun&s;el of his eternal will. It is with the &s;pi|ritual, as natural birth: All women have not the like pangs; all Chri&s;tians have not the like de|gree of conviction. But all agree in this, that all have Je&s;us Chri&s;t formed in their hearts: And tho&s;e who have not &s;o many trials at fir&s;t, may be vi&s;ited with the greater conflicts hereafter; though they never come into bondage again, after they have once received the &s;pirit of adoption. "We have not (&s;ays Paul) received the &s;pirit of bondage again unto fear." We know not what Zaccheus underwent before he died: However this one
<PB N="194" REF="029886_0189_0FE2C244D01AF878">
thing I know, he now believed in Chri&s;t, and was ju&s;tified, or acquitted, and looked upon as righte|ous in God's &s;ight, though a Publican, chief among the Publicans, not many moments before. And thus it is with all, that, like Zaccheus, receive Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, by faith into their hearts. The very moment they find re&s;t in him, they are freely ju&s;|tified from all things from which they could not be ju&s;tified by the law of Mo&s;es; "for by grace are we &s;aved, through faith, and that not of our|&s;elves, it is the gift of God."</P>
<P>Say not within your&s;elves this is a licentious, Antinomian doctrine; for this faith, if true, will work by love, and be productive of the fruits of holine&s;s. See an in&s;tance in this convert Zacche|as: No &s;ooner had he received Je&s;us Chri&s;t by faith into his heart, but he evidences it by his works; for ver. 8. we are told Zaccheus &s;tood forth, and &s;aid unto the Lord, "Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give unto the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by fal&s;e accu&s;ation, I re&s;tore him four fold."</P>
<P>Having believed on Je&s;us in his heart, he now makes confe&s;&s;ion of him with his mouth to &s;alva|tion. Zaccheus &s;tood forth: He was not a&s;ham|ed, but &s;tood forth before his brother Publicans; for true faith ca&s;ts out all &s;ervile, &s;inful fear of men; and &s;aid "Behold, Lord." It is remarka|ble, how readily people in &s;cripture have owned the divinity of Chri&s;t immediately, upon their con|ver&s;ion. Thus the woman at Jacob's well; "Is not this the Chri&s;t?" Thus the man born blind; "Lord, I believe; and wor&s;hipped him." Thus Zaccheus, "Behold, Lord." An inconte&s;tible proof this to me, that tho&s;e who deny our Lord's divinity, never effectually felt his power: If they
<PB N="195" REF="029886_0190_0FE2C2DB9543B5D8">
had, they would not &s;peak &s;o lightly of him; they would &s;corn to deny his eternal power and God-head. "Zaccheus &s;tood forth, and &s;aid, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken any thing from any man by fal&s;e accu&s;ation, I re&s;tore him fourfold." Noble fruits of a true living faith in the Lord Je&s;us! Every word calls for our notice. Not &s;ome &s;mall, not the tenth part, but the half. Of what? My goods; things that were valuable. My goods, his own, not another's: I give: Not, I will give when I die, when I can keep them no longer; but, I give now, even now. Zaccheus would be his own executor. For whil&s;t we have time we &s;hould do good. But to whom would he give half of his goods? Not to the rich, not to tho&s;e who were already clothed in purple and fine linen, of whom he might be recompen&s;ed again; but to the poor, the maimed, the halt, the blind, from which he could expect no recompence till the re&s;urrection of the dead. "I give to the poor." But know|ing that he mu&s;t be ju&s;t, before he could be chari|table, and con&s;cious to him&s;elf that in his public admini&s;trations he had wronged many per&s;ons, he adds, "And, if I have taken any thing from any man by fal&s;e accu&s;ation, I re&s;tore him fourfold." Hear ye this, all ye that make no con&s;cience of cheating the king of his taxes, or of buying or &s;elling run goods. If ever God gives you true faith, you will never re&s;t, till, like Zaccheus, you have made re&s;titution to the utmo&s;t of your pow|er. I &s;uppo&s;e, before his conver&s;ion he thought it no harm to cheat thus, no more than you may do now, and plea&s;ed him&s;elf frequently, to be &s;ure, that he got rich by doing &s;o: But now he is griev|ed for it at his heart; he confe&s;&s;es his inju&s;tice
<PB N="196" REF="029886_0191_0FE2C24B287DD458">
before men, and promi&s;es to make ample re&s;titu|tion. Go, ye cheating Publicans, learn of Zac|cheus, go away and do likewi&s;e; if you do not make re&s;titution here, the Lord Je&s;us &s;hall make you confe&s;s your &s;ins before men and angels, and condemn you for it, when he comes in the glory of his Father to judgment hereafter.</P>
<P>After all this, with good rea&s;on might our Lord &s;ay unto him, "This day is &s;alvation come to this hou&s;e; fora&s;much as he is the &s;on of Abraham;" not &s;o much by a natural as by a &s;piritual birth. He was made partaker of like precious faith with Abraham: Like Abraham, he believed on the Lord, and it was accounted to him for righteou&s;|ne&s;s: His faith, like Abraham's, worked by love; and I doubt not, but he has been long &s;ince &s;it|ting in Abraham's harbour.</P>
<P>And now are you not a&s;hamed of your&s;elves, who &s;peak again&s;t the doctrines of grace, e&s;pecially that doctrine of being ju&s;tified by faith alone, as though it leaded to licentiou&s;ne&s;s? What can be more unju&s;t than &s;uch a charge? Is not the in&s;tance of Zaccheus a &s;ufficient proof to the contrary? Have I &s;trained it to &s;erve my own turn? God forbid. To the be&s;t of my knowledge I have &s;poken the truth in &s;incerity, and the truth as it is in Je&s;us. I do affirm that we are &s;aved by grace, and that we are ju&s;tified by faith alone: But I do al&s;o affirm, that faith mu&s;t be evidenced by good works where there is an opportunity of performing them.</P>
<P>What therefore has been &s;aid of Zaccheus, may &s;erve as a rule, whereby all may judge whether they have faith or not. You &s;ay you have faith; but how do you prove it? Did you ever hear the Lord Je&s;us call you by name? Were you ever
<PB N="197" REF="029886_0192_0FE2C2E0618C5930">
made to obey that call? Did you ever, like Zac|cheus, receive Je&s;us Chri&s;t joyfully into your hearts? Are you influenced by the faith you &s;ay you have, to &s;tand up and confe&s;s the Lord Je&s;us before men? Were you ever made willing to own, and humble your&s;elves for, your pa&s;t offences? Does your faith work by love, &s;o that you con&s;cientiou&s;|ly lay up, according as God has pro&s;pered you, for the &s;upport of the poor? Do you give alms of all things that you po&s;&s;e&s;s? And have you made due re&s;titution to tho&s;e you have wronged? If &s;o, happy are ye; &s;alvation is come to your &s;ouls; you are &s;ons, you are daughters of, you &s;hall &s;hortly be everla&s;ting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ble&s;&s;ed with faithful Abraham. But, if you are not thus minded, do not deceive your own &s;ouls; though you may talk of ju&s;tifi|cation by &s;aith, like angels, it will do you no good; it will only increa&s;e your damnation. You hold the truth, but it is in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s: Your faith being without works, is dead; you have the devil, not Abraham, for your father. Unle&s;s you get a faith of the heart, a faith working by love, with devils and damned &s;pirits &s;hall you dwell for ever|more.</P>
<P>But it is time now to enforce the latter part of the text; "For the Son of man is come to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t." The&s;e words are &s;poken by our Saviour, in an&s;wer to &s;ome &s;elf|righteous Phari&s;ees, who in&s;tead of rejoicing with the angels in heaven, at the conver&s;ion of &s;uch a &s;inner, murmured, "that he was gone to be a gue&s;t with a man that was a &s;inner." To vindi|cate his conduct, he tells them, that this was an act agreeable to the de&s;ign of his coming: "For the Son of man is come to &s;eek and to &s;ave that
<PB N="198" REF="029886_0193_0FE2C24FCCBD2390">
which was lo&s;t." He might have &s;aid, the "Son of God." But O the wonderful conde&s;cen&s;ion of our Redeemer! He delights to &s;tyle him&s;elf the Son of man. He came not only to &s;ave, "but to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t." He came to Jericho to &s;eek and &s;ave Zaccheus; for other|wi&s;e Zaccheus would never have been &s;aved by him. But from whence came he? Even from heaven, his dwelling-place, to this lower earth, this vale of tears, "to &s;eek and &s;ave that which was lo&s;t;" or all that feel them&s;elves lo&s;t, and are willing, like Zaccheus, to receive him into their hearts to &s;ave them; with how great a &s;alvation? even from the guilt, and al&s;o from the power of their &s;ins; to make them heirs of God, and joint-heirs with him&s;elf, and partakers of that glory which he enjoyed with the Father before the world began. Thus will the Son of man &s;ave that which is lo&s;t. He was made the Son of man on purpo&s;e that he might &s;ave them. He had no other end but this in leaving his Father's throne, in obeying the moral law, and hanging upon the cro&s;s: All that was done and &s;uffered, merely to &s;atisfy, and procure a righteou&s;ne&s;s for poor, lo&s;t, undone &s;inners, and that too without re&s;pect of per&s;ons. "That which was lo&s;t:" all of every nation and language, that feel, bewail, and are truly de&s;irous of being delivered from their lo&s;t &s;tate, did the Son of man come down to &s;eek and to &s;ave: For he is mighty, not only &s;o, but will|ing, to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that come to God through him; he will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t them out. For he is the &s;ame to-day as he was ye&s;terday. He comes now to &s;inners, as well as formerly; and, I hope, hath &s;ent me out this day to &s;eek,
<PB N="199" REF="029886_0194_0FE2C2E7AE693DA8">
and, under him, to bring home &s;ome of you, the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>What &s;ay you? Shall I go home rejoicing, &s;ay|ing, that many like &s;heep, have gone a&s;tray, but they have now believed on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;o re|turned home to the great Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of their &s;ouls? If the Lord would be plea&s;ed thus to pro&s;per my handy-work, I care not how many le|gali&s;ts and &s;elf-righteous Phari&s;ees murmur again&s;t me, for offering &s;alvation to the wor&s;t of &s;inners: For I know the Son of man came to &s;eek and to &s;ave them; and the Lord Je&s;us will now be a gue&s;t to the wor&s;t Publican, the vile&s;t &s;inner that is among you, if he does but believe on him.&mdash;Make ha&s;te then, O &s;inners, make ha&s;te, and come by faith to Chri&s;t. Then, this day, even this hour, nay this moment, if you believe, Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall come and make his eternal abode in your hearts. Which of you is made willing to receive the King of glory? Which of you obeys the call, as Zaccheus did? Alas! why do you &s;tand &s;till? How know you, whether Je&s;us Chri&s;t may ever call you again? Come then, poor, guil|ty &s;inners; come away, poor, lo&s;t, undone Publi|cans: Make ha&s;te, I &s;ay, and come away to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The Lord conde&s;cends to invite him&s;elf to come under the filthy roofs of the hou&s;es of your &s;ouls. Do not be afraid of entertaining him; he will fill you with all peace and joy in believing. Do not be a&s;hamed to run before the multitude, and to have all manner of evil &s;poken again&s;t you fal&s;ely for his &s;ake: One &s;ight of Chri&s;t will make amends for all. Zaccheus was laughed at; and "all that will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hall &s;uf|fer per&s;ecution." But what of that? Zaccheus is now crowned in glory; as you al&s;o &s;hall &s;hortly
<PB N="200" REF="029886_0195_0FE2C255405A9B50">
be, if you believe on, and are reproached for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. Do not, therefore, put me off with frivolous excu&s;es; there is no excu&s;e can be given for your not coming to Chri&s;t. You are lo&s;t, un|done without him; and if he is not glorified in your &s;alvation, he will be glorified in your de&s;truc|tion; if he does not come and make his abode in your hearts, you mu&s;t take up an eternal abode with the devil and his angels. O that the Lord would be plea&s;ed to pa&s;s by &s;ome of you at this time! O that he may call you by his Spirit, and make you a willing people in this day of his power! For I know my calling will not do, unle&s;s he, by his efficacious grace, compel you to come in. O that you once felt what it is to receive Je&s;us Chri&s;t into your hearts! You would &s;oon, like Zacche|us, give him every thing. You do not love Chri&s;t, becau&s;e you do not know him; you do not come to him, becau&s;e you do not feel your want of him: you are whole and not broken-hearted; you are not &s;ick, at lea&s;t not &s;en&s;ible of your &s;ickne&s;s; and, therefore, no wonder you do not apply to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that great, that almigh|ty phy&s;ician. You do not feel your&s;elves lo&s;t, and therefore do not &s;eek to be found in Chri&s;t. O that God would wound you with the &s;word of his Spirit, and cau&s;e his arrows of conviction to &s;tick deep in your hearts! O that he would dart a ray of divine light into your &s;ouls! For if you do not feel your&s;elves lo&s;t without Chri&s;t, you are of all men mo&s;t mi&s;erable: your &s;ouls are dead; you are not only an image of hell, but in &s;ome degree hell it&s;elf: you carry hell about with you, and you know it not. O that I could &s;ee &s;ome of you &s;en&s;ible of this, and hear you cry out, "Lord, break this hard heart; Lord, deliver me from the

body of this death; draw me, Lord make me willing to come after thee; I am lo&s;t; Lord, &s;ave me, or I peri&s;h!" Was this your ca&s;e, how &s;oon would the Lord &s;tretch forth his almighty hand, and &s;ay, be of good cheer, it is I; be not afraid? What a wonderful calm would then po&s;&s;e&s;s your troubled &s;ouls! Your fellow&s;hip would then be with the Father and the Son: Your life would be hid with Chri&s;t in God.</P>
<P>Some of you, I hope, have experienced this, and can &s;ay, I was loft, but am found; I was dead, but am alive again. The Son of man came and &s;ought me in the day of his power, and &s;aved my &s;inful &s;oul. And do you repent that you came to Chri&s;t? Has he not been a good Ma&s;ter! Is not his pre&s;ence &s;weet to your &s;ouls? Has he not been faithful to his promi&s;e? And have you not found, that even in doing and &s;uffering for him, there is an exceeding pre&s;ent great reward? I am per&s;uaded you will an&s;wer, Yes. O then, ye &s;aints, recommend and talk of the love of Chri&s;t to oth|ers, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you! This may encourage others to come unto him. And who knows but the Lord may make you fi&s;hers of men? The &s;tory of Zac|cheus was left on record for this purpo&s;e. No truly convicted &s;oul, after &s;uch an in&s;tance of di|vine grace has been laid before him, need de&s;pair of mercy. What if you are Publicans? Was not Zaccheus a Publican? What if you are chief among the Publicans? Was not Zaccheus like|wi&s;e? What if you are rich? Was not Zaccheus rich al&s;o? And yet almighty grace made him more than conqueror over all the&s;e hindrances. All things are po&s;&s;ible to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; nothing is too hard for him: he is the Lord almighty. Our

mountains of &s;ins mu&s;t all fall before this great Zerubabel. On him God the Father has laid the iniquities of all that &s;hall truly believe; and in his own body he bare them on the tree.

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PHILIP. iii. 10.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>That I may know him, and the power of his re&s;ur|rection.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE apo&s;tle, in the ver&s;es before the text, had been cautioning the Philippians to be|ware of the conci&s;ion, Jadaizing teachers, who en|deavoured to &s;ubvert them from the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel, by telling them, they &s;till ought to be &s;ubject to circumci&s;ion and all the other ordinan|ces of Mo&s;es. And that they might not think he &s;poke out of prejudice, and condemned their tenets becau&s;e he him&s;elf was a &s;tranger to the Jew|i&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation, he acquaints them, that if any other man thought he had whereof he might tru&s;t in the fle&s;h, or &s;eek to be ju&s;tified by the outward privileges of the Jews, he had more: for he was circumci&s;ed the eighth day; of the &s;tock of I&s;rael (not a pro&s;elyte, but a native I&s;raelite;) of the tribe of Benjamin (the tribe which adhered to Judah when the others revolted;) an Hebrew of the Hebrews, a Jew both of the father and mo|ther's &s;ide) and as touching the law, a phari&s;ee, the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ect among all I&s;rael. To &s;hew that he was no Gallio in religion, through his great though mi&s;guided zeal, he had per&s;ecuted the church of Chri&s;t; and as touching the righteou&s;|ne&s;s
<PB N="205" REF="029886_0200_0FE2C2F7C317B7B0">
of the law (as far as the Phari&s;ees expo&s;ition of it went) he was blamele&s;s, and had kept it from his youth. But, when it plea&s;ed God who &s;eparated him from his mother's womb, to reveal his Son in him, What things were gain to me, (he &s;ays) tho&s;e privileges I boa&s;ted my&s;elf in, and &s;ought to be ju&s;tified by, I counted lo&s;s for Chri&s;t. And that they might not think he repented that he had done &s;o, he tells them, he was now more confirmed than ever in his judgment. For, &s;ays he, "yea doubtle&s;s," (the expre&s;&s;ion in the origi|nal ri&s;es with a holy triumph)" and I do count all things but lo&s;s for the excellency of the knowledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us my Lord." And that they might not object that he &s;aid, and did not, he acquaints them, he had given proofs of the &s;incerity of the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, becau&s;e for the &s;ake of them, he had &s;uffered the lo&s;s of all his worldly things, and &s;till was willing to do more; for, "I count them but dung (no more than offals thrown out to dogs) &s;o that I may win, (or have a &s;aving intere&s;t in) Chri&s;t, and be found in him, (as the man&s;layer in the city of refuge) not having my own righteou&s;|ne&s;s which is of the law," not depending on hav|ing Abraham for my father, or on any works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which I have done, either to a|tone or &s;erve as a balance for my evil deeds, but that which is through the faith of Chri&s;t, the right|eou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by faith, a righteou&s;ne&s;s of God's appointing, and which will be imputed to me, if I believe in Chri&s;t, "that I may know him, and the power of his re&s;urrection;" that I may have an experimental knowledge of the effi|cacy of his re&s;urrect on by feeling the influences of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit on my &s;oul. In which words two things are implied.</P>

<P>Accordingly in the following di&s;cour&s;e I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew

<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That Chri&s;t is ri&s;en indeed from the dead; and that it was nece&s;&s;ary for him &s;o to do; and,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> That it highly concerns us to know and experience the power of his re&s;urrection.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Chri&s;t is indeed ri&s;en.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>That Je&s;us &s;hould ri&s;e from the dead was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> on his own account. He had often appealed to this as the la&s;t and mo&s;t convincing proof, he would give them that he was the true Me&s;&s;iah, "There &s;hall no other &s;ign be given you, than the &s;ign of the prophet Jonas. And again, De&s;troy this temple of my body, and in three days I will build it up." Which words his enemies remembered, and urged it as an argument, to in|duce Pilate to grant them a watch, to prevent his being &s;tolen out of the grave. "We know that deceiver &s;aid, whil&s;t he was yet alive, after three days I will ri&s;e again." So that had he not ri&s;en again, they might have ju&s;tly &s;aid, we know that this man was an impo&s;tor.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It was nece&s;&s;ary on our account. "He ro&s;e again, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, for our ju&s;tifica|tion;" or that the debt we owed to God for our &s;ins, might be fully &s;atisfied and di&s;charged.</P>
<P>It had plea&s;ed the Father (for ever adored be his infinite love and free grace) to wound his only Son for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and to arre&s;t and confine him in the pri&s;on of the grave, as our &s;urety for the guilt we had contracted by &s;etting at nought his commandments. Now had Chri&s;t continued al|ways
<PB N="207" REF="029886_0202_0FE2C2FF90AB6520">
in the grave, we could have had no more a&s;&s;urance that our &s;ins were &s;atisfied for, than any common debtor can have of his creditor's being &s;atisfied whil&s;t his &s;urety is kept confined. But he being relea&s;ed from the power of death, we are thereby a&s;&s;ured, that with his &s;acrifice God was well plea&s;ed, and that our atonement was fini&s;hed on the cro&s;s, and that he had made a full, perfect, and &s;ufficient &s;acrifice, oblation, and &s;atisfaction for the &s;ins of the world.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> It was nece&s;&s;ary that our Lord Je&s;us &s;hould ri&s;e again from the dead, to a&s;&s;ure us of the certainty of the re&s;urrection of our own bodies.</P>
<P>The doctrine of the re&s;urrection of the body was entirely exploded and &s;et at nought among the Gentiles, as appears from the Athenians mocking at, and calling St. Paul a babbler and a &s;etter forth of &s;trange doctrines when he preached to them Je|&s;us, and the re&s;urrection. And though it was be|lieved by mo&s;t of the Jews, as is evident from ma|ny pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, yet not by all; the whole &s;ect of the Sadduces denied it. But the re&s;urrec|tion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t put it out of di&s;pute. For as he acted as our repre&s;entative, if he our Head is ri&s;en, then mu&s;t we al&s;o, who are his members ri&s;e with him. And as in the fir&s;t Adam we all died, even &s;o in him our &s;econd Adam we mu&s;t all, in this &s;en&s;e, be made alive.</P>
<P>As it was nece&s;&s;ary, upon the&s;e accounts, that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;hould ri&s;e from the dead; &s;o it is plain beyond contradiction, that he did. Nev|er was any matter of fact better atte&s;ted; never were more precautions made u&s;e of to prevent a cheat. He was buried in a &s;epulchre, hewn out of a rock, &s;o that it could not be &s;aid that any digged under, and conveyed him away. It was a
<PB N="208" REF="029886_0203_0FE2C26C830C9808">
&s;epulchre al&s;o wherein man never was laid; &s;o that if any body did ri&s;e from thence, it mu&s;t be the body of Je&s;us of Nazareth. Be&s;ides, the &s;epulchre was &s;ealed; a great &s;tone rolled over the mouth of it; and a band of &s;oldiers (con&s;i&s;t|ing not of friends, but of his profe&s;&s;ed enemies) was &s;et to guard it. And as for his di&s;ciples coming by night and &s;tealing him away, it was altogether improbable: for it was not long &s;ince, that they had all for&s;aken him, and they were the mo&s;t backward in believing his re&s;urrection. And &s;up|po&s;ing it was true that they came whil&s;t the &s;ol|diers &s;lept; yet the &s;oldiers mu&s;t be ca&s;t into a deep &s;leep indeed, that the rolling away &s;o great a &s;tone did not awake &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>And our ble&s;&s;ed Lord's afterwards appearing at &s;undry times, and in divers manners, to his di&s;ci|ples, as when they were a&s;&s;embled together, when they were walking to Emma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, when they were fi&s;hing; nay, and conde&s;cending to &s;hew them his hands and feet, and his appearing to above five hundred brethren at once, put the truth of his re|&s;urrection out of all di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Indeed there is one objection that may be made again&s;t what has been &s;aid, that the books wherein the&s;e facts are recorded were written by his di&s;|&s;ciples.</P>
<P>And who more proper per&s;ons than tho&s;e who were eye-witne&s;&s;es of what they related, and eat and drank with him after his re&s;urrection? "But they were illiterate and ignorant men." Yet as good witne&s;&s;es of a plain matter of fact, as the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t learned ma&s;ters in I&s;rael. Nay, this render|ed them more proper witne&s;&s;es. For being plain men, they were therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to be &s;u&s;pected of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing or making a lie, particularly, &s;ince they
<PB N="209" REF="029886_0204_0FE2C3042DF07B98">
laid down their lives for a te&s;timony of the truth of it. We read indeed of Jacob's telling a lie, though he was a plain man, in order to get his father's ble&s;&s;ing. But it was never heard &s;ince the world began, that any man, much le&s;s a whole &s;et of men, died martyrs for the &s;ake of an untruth, when they them&s;elves were to reap no advantage from it.</P>
<P>No, this &s;ingle circum&s;tance proves them to be I&s;raelites indeed, in whom was no guile. And the wonderful &s;ucce&s;s God gave to their mini&s;try after|wards, when three thou&s;and were converted by one &s;ermon; and twelve poor fi&s;hermen, in a very &s;hort time enabled to be more than conquerors over all the oppo&s;ition men or devils could make, was as plain a demon&s;tration, that Chri&s;t was ri&s;en, accord|ing to their go&s;pel, as that a divine power, at the &s;ound of a few ram horns, cau&s;ed the wall of Jeri|ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to fall down.</P>
<P>But what need we any farther witne&s;&s;es? Believe you the re&s;urrection of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord? I know that you believe it, as your gathering together on this fir&s;t day of the week in the courts o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Lord's hou&s;e abundantly te&s;tifies.</P>
<P>What concerns us mo&s;t to be a&s;&s;ured of, and which is the</P>
<P><HI>Second</HI> thing I was to &s;peak to, is, Whether we have experimentally known the power of his re&s;ur|rection; that is, Whether or not we have received the Holy Gho&s;t, and by his powerful operations on our hearts, have been rai&s;ed from the death of &s;in, to a life of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and true holine&s;s.</P>
<P>It was this, the great apo&s;tle was chiefly de&s;irous to know: the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t's body he was &s;atisfied would avail him nothing, unle&s;s he experi|enced the power of it in rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> dead &s;oul.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="029886_0205_0FE2C34906831188">
For another, and that a chief end of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord's ri&s;ing from the dead, was to enter heaven as our repre&s;entative, and to &s;end down the Holy Gho&s;t to apply that redemption he had fini&s;hed on the cro&s;s, to our hearts, by working an entire change in them.</P>
<P>Without this, Chri&s;t would have died in vain. For it would have done us no &s;ervice to have had his outward righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed to us, unle&s;s we had an inward inherent righteou&s;ne&s;s wrought in us. Becau&s;e, being altogether conceived and born in &s;in, and con&s;equently unfit to hold communion with an infinitely pure and holy God, we cannot po&s;&s;ibly be made meet to &s;ee and enjoy him, till a thorough renovation has pa&s;&s;ed upon our hearts.</P>
<P>Without this we leave out the Holy Gho&s;t in the great work of our redemption. But as we were made by the joint concurrence and con&s;ulta|tion of the ble&s;&s;ed Trinity; and as we were bap|tized in their name, &s;o mu&s;t all of them concur in our &s;alvation: as the Father made, and the Son redeemed, &s;o mu&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t &s;anctify and &s;eal us, or otherwi&s;e we have believed in vain.</P>
<P>This then is what the apo&s;tle means by the pow|er of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection, and this is what we are as much concerned experimentally to know, as that he ro&s;e at all.</P>
<P>Without this, though we may be morali&s;ts, though we may be civilized, good-natured people, yet we are no Chri&s;tians. For he is not a true Chri&s;tian, who is only one outwardly; nor have we therefore a right, becau&s;e we daily profe&s;s, to be|lieve that Chri&s;t ro&s;e again the third day from the dead. But he is a true Chri&s;tian who is one in|wardly, and then only can we be &s;tyled true be|lievers, when we not only profe&s;s to believe, but
<PB N="211" REF="029886_0206_0FE2C328462C8D18">
have felt the power of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord's ri&s;ing from the dead, by being quickened and rai&s;ed by his Spirit, when dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, to a thorough newne&s;s both of heart and life.</P>
<P>The devils them&s;elves cannot but believe the doctrine of the re&s;urrection, and tremble; but yet they continue devils, becau&s;e the benefits of this re&s;urrection have not been applied to them, nor have they received a renovating power from it, to change and put off their diabolical nature. And &s;o, unle&s;s we not only profe&s;s to know, but al&s;o feel that Chri&s;t is ri&s;en indeed, by being born a|gain from above, we &s;hall be as far from the king|dom of God as they: our faith will be as ineffectu|al as the faith of devils.</P>
<P>Nothing has done more harm to the Chri&s;tian world, nothing has rendered the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t of le&s;s effect, than a vain &s;uppo&s;ition, that religion is &s;omething without us. Whereas we &s;hould con|&s;ider, that every thing that Chri&s;t did outwardly&punc; mu&s;t be done over again in our &s;ouls; or other|wi&s;e, the believing there was &s;uch a divine Per&s;on once on earth who triumphed over hell and the grave, will profit us no more than believing there was once &s;uch a per&s;on as Alexander who con|quered the world.</P>
<P>As Chri&s;t was born of the Virgin's womb, &s;o mu&s;t he be &s;piritually formed in our hearts. As he died for &s;in, &s;o mu&s;t we die to &s;in. And as he ro&s;e again from the dead, &s;o mu&s;t we al&s;o ri&s;e to a divine life.</P>
<P>None but tho&s;e who have followed him in this regeneration, or new-birth, &s;hall &s;it on thrones as approvers of his &s;entence, when he &s;hall come in terrible maje&s;ty to judge the twelve tribes of I&s;rael.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="029886_0207_0FE2C30B9A2C1A90">
It is true, as for the outward work of our re|demption, it was a tran&s;ient act, and was certainly fini&s;hed on the cro&s;s; but the application of that redemption to our hearts, is a work that will con|tinue always, even unto the end of the world.</P>
<P>So long as there is an elect man breathing on the earth, who is naturally engendered of the off|&s;pring of the fir&s;t Adam, &s;o long mu&s;t the quick|ening Spirit, which was purcha&s;ed by the re&s;ur|rection of the &s;econd Adam, that Lord from heaven, be breathing upon his &s;oul.</P>
<P>For though we may exi&s;t by Chri&s;t, yet we cannot be &s;aid to exi&s;t in him, till we are united to him by one &s;pirit, and enter into a new &s;tate of things, as certainly as he entered into a new &s;tate of things, after that he ro&s;e from the dead.</P>
<P>We may throng and crowd round about Chri&s;t, and call him Lord, Lord, when we come to wor|&s;hip before his foot&s;tool; but we have not effec|tually touched him, till by a lively faith in his re|&s;urrection, we perceive a divine virtue coming out of him, to renew and purify our &s;ouls.</P>
<P>How greatly then do they err who re&s;t in a bare hi&s;torical faith of our Saviour's re&s;urrection, and look only for external proofs to evidence it? Whereas were we the mo&s;t learned di&s;puters of this world, and could &s;peak of the certainty of this fact with the tongue of men and angels, yet with|out this inward te&s;timony of it in our hearts, tho' we might convince others, yet we &s;hould never be &s;aved by it our&s;elves.</P>
<P>For we are but dead men, we are like &s;o many carca&s;es wrapt up in grave clothes, till that &s;ame Je&s;us who called Lazarus from his tomb, and at who&s;e own re&s;urrection many that &s;lept aro&s;e, doth rai&s;e us al&s;o by his quickening Spirit from our
<PB N="213" REF="029886_0208_0FE2C32C980C6AF8">
natural death, in which we have &s;o long lain, to a holy and heavenly life.</P>
<P>We might think our&s;elves happy, if we had &s;een the holy Je&s;us after he was ri&s;en from the dead, and our hands had handled that Lord of life. But more happy are they who have not &s;een him, and yet having felt the power of his re&s;ur|rection, therefore believe in him. For many &s;aw our divine Ma&s;ter, who were not &s;aved by him; but who&s;oever has thus felt the power of his re|&s;urrection, has the earne&s;t of his inheritance in his heart, he has pa&s;&s;ed from death to life, and &s;hall never fall into final condemnation.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible that this is fooli&s;hne&s;s to the natural man, as were many &s;uch like truths to our Lord's own di&s;ciples, when only weak in faith, be|fore he ro&s;e again. But when the&s;e natural men, like them, have fully felt the power of his re&s;ur|rection, they will then own that this doctrine is from God, and &s;ay with the Samaritans, "Now we believe not becau&s;e of thy &s;aying," for we our|&s;elves have experienced it in our hearts.</P>
<P>And O that all unbelievers, all letter-learned ma&s;ters of I&s;rael, who now look upon the doctrine of the power of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection, or our new|birth, as an idle tale, and condemn the preachers of it as enthu&s;ia&s;ts and madmen, did but thus feel the power of it in their &s;ouls, they would no long|er a&s;k, how this thing could be? But they would be convinced of it as much as Thomas was, when he &s;aw the Lord's Chri&s;t; and like him, when Je&s;us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">id him reach out his hands and thru&s;t them into his &s;ide, in a holy confu&s;ion they would cry out, "My Lord, and my God!"</P>
<P>But how &s;hall an unbeliever, how &s;hall the for|mal Chri&s;tian come thus to "know Chri&s;t, and
<PB N="214" REF="029886_0209_0FE2C311901EB968">
the power of his re&s;urrection?" God, who cannot lie, has told us, "I am the re&s;urrection and the life, who&s;oever liveth and believeth in me, though he were dead, yet &s;hall he live." Again &s;ays the apo&s;tle, "By faith we are &s;aved, and that not of our&s;elves, it is the gift of God."</P>
<P>This, this is the way, walk in it. Believe and you &s;hall live in Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t in you; you &s;hall be one with Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t one with you. But without this, your outward goodne&s;s and pro|fe&s;&s;ions will avail you nothing.</P>
<P>But then, by this faith we are not to under&s;tand a dead &s;peculative faith, a faith in the head; but a living principle wrought in the heart by the powerful operations of the Holy Gho&s;t, a faith that will enable us to overcome the world, and for&s;ake all in affection for Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For thus &s;peaks our ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, "Unle&s;s a man for&s;ake all that he hath, he cannot be my di&s;ciple."</P>
<P>And &s;o the apo&s;tle, in the words immediately following the text, &s;ays, "being made conform|able to his death;" thereby implying, that we cannot know the power of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection un|le&s;s we are made conformable to him in his death.</P>
<P>This we have &s;hadowed out by the cu&s;tom of baptizing by immer&s;ion in the primitive church, and (which is al&s;o recommended by our own) their putting the infants under the water, &s;ignified their obligation to die unto &s;in; as their taking them out of the water, &s;ignified their ri&s;ing again to newne&s;s of life. To which the apo&s;tle plainly al|ludes, when he &s;ays, "we are buried with him in bapti&s;m."</P>
<P>If we can reconcile light and darkne&s;s, heaven and hell, then we may hope to know the power of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection without dying to our&s;elves
<PB N="215" REF="029886_0210_0FE2C3322AC5F768">
and the world. But till we can do this, we might as well expect that Chri&s;t will have concord with Belial.</P>
<P>For there is &s;uch a contrariety between the &s;pi|rit of this world, and the &s;pirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that he who will be at friend&s;hip with the one, mu&s;t be at enmity with the other: "We cannot &s;erve God and mammon."</P>
<P>This may, indeed, &s;eem a hard &s;aying; and many, with the young man in the go&s;pel, may be tempted to go away &s;orrowful: but wherefore &s;hould this offend them? For what is all that is in the world, the lu&s;t of the eye, the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, and the pride of life, but vanity and vexation of &s;pirit?</P>
<P>God is love; and therefore, could our own wills, or the world, have made us happy, he never would have &s;ent his own dear Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t to die and ri&s;e again, to deliver us from the power of them. But becau&s;e they only torment and cannot &s;atisfy, therefore God bids us to renounce them.</P>
<P>Had any one per&s;uaded profane E&s;au not to lo&s;e &s;o glorious a privilege, merely for the &s;ake of gratifying a pre&s;ent corrupt inclination, when he law him about to &s;ell his birth-right for a little red pottage, would not one think that man to have been E&s;au's friend! And ju&s;t thus &s;tands the ca&s;e between God and us. By the death and re|&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we are new-born to an heavenly inheritance among all them which are &s;anctified; but our own corrupt wills would tempt us to &s;ell this glorious birth-right for the vanities of the world, which, like E&s;au's red pottage, may plea&s;e us for a while, but will &s;oon be taken away from us. God knows this, and therefore rather bids us renounce them for a &s;ea&s;on, than for the
<PB N="216" REF="029886_0211_0FE2C31690C22170">
&s;hort enjoyment of them lo&s;e the privilege of that glorious birth-right, to which, by knowing the power of the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we are entitled.</P>
<P>O the depth of the riches and excellency of Chri&s;tianity! Well might the great St. Paul count all things but dung and dro&s;s for the excellency of the knowledge of it. Well might he de&s;ire &s;o ardently to know Je&s;us, and the power of his re|&s;urrection. For even on this &s;ide eternity it rai&s;es us above the world, and makes us to &s;it in heav|enly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Well might that glorious company of worthies, recorded in the holy &s;criptures, &s;upported with a deep &s;en&s;e of their heavenly calling, de&s;pi&s;e the plea&s;ures and profits of this life, and wander about in &s;heep-&s;kins, and goat-&s;kins, in dens and caves of the earth, being de&s;titute, afflicted, tormented.</P>
<P>And O that we were all like-minded! that we felt the power of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection as they did! How &s;hould we then count all things as dung and dro&s;s for the excellency of the knowledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord! How &s;hould we then recover our primitive dignity, trample the earth under our feet, and with our &s;ouls be continually ga&s;ping after God.</P>
<P>And what hinders but we may be thus minded? Is Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our great High Prie&s;t, altered from what he was? No, he is the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to day and for ever. And though he is exalted to the righthand of God, yet he is not a&s;hamed to call us brethren. The power of his re&s;urrection is as great now as formerly, and the Holy Spirit, which was a&s;&s;ured to us by his re&s;urrection, as ready and able to quicken us who are dead in tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, as any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aint that ever lived. Let

us but cry, and that in&s;tantly, to him that is mighty and able to &s;ave; let us, in &s;incerity and truth, without &s;ecretly keeping back the lea&s;t part, renounce our&s;elves and the world; then we &s;hall be Chri&s;tians indeed. And though the world may ca&s;t us out and &s;eparate from our company, yet Je&s;us Chri&s;t will walk with, and abide in us. And at the general re&s;urrection of the la&s;t day, when the voice of the archangel and trump of God &s;hall bid the &s;ea and the graves to give up their dead, and all nations &s;hall appear before him, then will he confe&s;s us before his Father and the holy angels, and we &s;hall receive that invitation which he &s;hall then pronounce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o all who love and fear him, "Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed children of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world."</P>
<P>"Grant this, O Father, for thy dear Son's &s;ake, Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord; to whom, with thee and the Holy Gho&s;t, &amp;c."</P>
