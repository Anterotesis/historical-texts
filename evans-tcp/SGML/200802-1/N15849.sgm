THE General-A&s;&s;embly of this State was, per|haps, never convened at a &s;ea&s;on that called louder for the wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e, the under&s;tanding of the aged, the &s;peech of the tru&s;ty, or the guidance of him who is wonderful in coun&s;el and excellent in working.&mdash;No, not in tho&s;e trying hours, when, in the face of the ho&s;tile power of Britain, the arm of America was lifted to Heaven, and &s;he declared &s;overeign and independent. If to recover the bewildered traveller is as intere&s;ting as to point him his way at fir&s;t&mdash;if to extricate from embarra&s;&s;ments require as much wi&s;dom as to prevent them&mdash;and if to &s;ave a kingdom is as important as to found one, the truth of tho&s;e declarations will be readily conceded.</P>

<P>THERE is a GOD&mdash;and MAN is his creature.&mdash;The &s;overeign, independent, and all-perfect character of GOD, and the weak, dependant, and imperfect character of MAN, are clearly &s;een from the light of nature, rea&s;on, and experience. He mu&s;t be a fool and without ex|cu&s;e, who &s;aith in his heart, there is no God; or boa&s;ts of his own powers and faculties, as though he had not received them.</P>
<P>WHEREVER we go, though among the mo&s;t barbarous of the earth, we &s;ee the Temple and the Altar, the &s;acrifice and the oblation, tokens of ac|knowledged dependance upon an un&s;een Power.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="020253_0008_0FAE9CB4759698F0">
WHAT the light of nature dictates, revelation confirms, and teaches us, that though God made man after his own image, and gave him di&s;tin|gui&s;hed powers and capacities to be his &s;ubordinate guides and directors, in the duties of his elevated &s;tation; yet he communicated but his image, not his nature. He retained man dependant upon him&s;elf, and in his be&s;t &s;tate man needed habitual in&s;truction and direction from his all-wi&s;e Creator.</P>
<P>THIS golden age is pa&s;t, the powers of man have &s;uffered an humiliating &s;hock in the &s;ad apo&s;tacy of our race from God. "The under&s;tanding is darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in us, by rea&s;on of the blindne&s;s of our hearts," and though man would be wi&s;e, he is born with very little preten|&s;ion to the exalted character.</P>
<P>MANY are the in&s;tances, in private life, in mere per&s;onal concerns, where the wi&s;dom of the pru|dent fails him, and he knows not what to do; well may we &s;uppo&s;e it will not be more adequate to the complicated affairs of civil government, which involve the duty and intere&s;t of many indi|viduals, or that tho&s;e who are honored with the
<PB N="10" REF="020253_0009_0FAE9CB530C219F8">
important charge of guiding and directing the&s;e will feel them&s;elves in le&s;s need of a &s;uperior influence.</P>
<P>THERE is an in&s;tinctive propen&s;ity in our na|tures, in &s;cenes of perplexity and di&s;tre&s;s, e&s;pecially if they are become &s;ufficiently pre&s;&s;ing, to look out for foreign aid; and the light of rea&s;on leads us ultimately to him who teacheth man know|ledge and giveth him under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>PRAYER to God for wi&s;dom is a duty of natu|ral religion; and perhaps no nation can be named that has not &s;ought, in &s;ome expre&s;&s;ive way, to the Deity it acknowledged, for help in trouble, and guidance in important affairs of government. The Heathen mariners, with whom Jonah fled to Tar&s;hi&s;h, applied to this duty in the hour of their di&s;tre&s;s, and thought him a miracle of &s;tupidity that he could &s;leep and neglect it. The Romans, no le&s;s renowned for their wi&s;dom than their valor, paid a very a&s;&s;iduous attention to this duty; they con&s;ulted their au&s;pices at the appointment of their civil and military officers, and at the determina|tion of every de&s;ign of con&s;equence. What they did from the una&s;&s;i&s;ted light of nature, we are di|rected
<PB N="11" REF="020253_0010_0FAE9CB79FA2A200">
to do by the light of divine revelation, and that glorious Being from whom alone help comes, &s;ays, "If any man lack wi&s;dom, let him a&s;k of God." And he not only points us our duty, but enjoins it under the highe&s;t encouragement; for he a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>he gives liberally.</HI> He is the all-wise and infinitely good God, and never &s;aid to any, &s;eek ye me in vain.</P>
<P>THE words of the text &s;eem to be de&s;igned for the direction and encouragement of an individual in his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ate concerns, but they apply with higher energy and encouragement to tho&s;e that are en|tru&s;ted with the concerns of thou&s;ands of indivi|duals, in proportion to the greater dignity of their &s;tation, the more intricate perplexity of their af|fairs, and the more exten&s;ive influence of their mea&s;ures. And he not only gives liberally, but <HI>he upbraideth not:</HI> he does not, as is too often the ca&s;e with human coun&s;ellors, cen&s;ure the weak|ne&s;s or ignorance of his &s;upplicants, the trifling|ne&s;s of the occa&s;ions upon which they apply, or their pa&s;t neglect of him. He is not wearied with the frequency of their addre&s;&s;es, nor with the ear|ne&s;tne&s;s and per&s;everance with which they pur&s;ue them. <HI>He upbraideth not,</HI> but clo&s;es his encou|ragement
<PB N="12" REF="020253_0011_0FAE9CB870509B48">
with a promi&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s to him who a&s;ks aright, it &s;hall be given him. The meek he will guide in judgment; the meek he will teach his way.</P>
<P>THEY who are unacquainted with the great truths of the Go&s;pel, may be accepted in their im|mediate application to the throne of the divine Ma|je&s;ty; but they who have heard of Je&s;us the me|diator, is advocate and interce&s;&s;or at the right hand of God, mu&s;t approach in his name as they would hope for audience and acceptance; for no man cometh to the Father but by him, and there is no other name in which we can be heard. The apo&s;|tle &s;ugge&s;ts as much in the words immediately following the text, when he &s;ays, "Let him a&s;k in faith nothing wavering," for Chri&s;t is the author, the object, and the medium of faith; and "what|&s;oever we a&s;k the father in his name, believing, we &s;hall receive."</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible there are tho&s;e who, from the glo|rious perfections of the Deity, endeavor to derive an argument again&s;t prayer; and improve the glo|ry of the divine character as a rea&s;on for withold|ing all explicit homage. Their argument is, that
<PB N="13" REF="020253_0012_0FAE9CB949F73560">
as God is an omni&s;cient and infinitely benevolent Being, he mu&s;t know all our wants, and be ready to &s;upply them; and as he is the unchanging God, the mo&s;t fervent addre&s;&s;es can be of no efficacy. But the argument mi&s;takes the end and de&s;ign of prayer, which is not to inform God, or influence him to change, but to render us proper objects of divine mercies, and fit us to receive them; and nothing can be plainer, from the word of God, than that prayer is the enjoined duty of tho&s;e that need mercies, and the u&s;ual pre-requi&s;ite of Heaven to their be&s;towal. "A&s;k and ye &s;hall receive, I will be inquired of to do it for them. If any of you lack wi&s;dom, let him a&s;k of God." If this be true, the omni&s;cience and unchangablene&s;s of God af|ford the &s;tronge&s;t arguments for prayer; for with|out it he mu&s;t, in an ordinary way, &s;ee us unfit to receive mercies, and mu&s;t change his u&s;ual method to be&s;tow them.</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to our prayers for wi&s;dom and direc|tion, we are not to expect any oracular re&s;pon&s;es, or miraculous communications; but a &s;ecret divine energy attending the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e fa|culties that heaven has given us to improve, di|recting their u&s;e, &s;trengthening them in exerci&s;e,
<PB N="14" REF="020253_0013_0FAE9CB9C0D3F9A0">
removing darkne&s;s and difficulties out of the way, and fixing in tho&s;e re&s;olves which he will approve, who&s;e coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand, and who will do all his plea&s;ure. Shall &s;uch communications be thought impo&s;&s;ible or improbable, from him who is a &s;pi|rit? Who is the Father of our &s;pirits, acquainted with all their powers and principles, and who can|not but have intimate acce&s;s to them? Are they not communications that are con&s;entaneous to the glo|rious character of God, as the all-perfect &s;pirit, and to the character of man as a rational, moral, and yet dependant creature? "Man's heart devi&s;eth his way, but the Lord directeth his &s;teps. He giveth under&s;tanding to the &s;imple, and taketh the wi&s;e in their own craftine&s;s." The objections to this duty, the &s;cruples concerning it, originate in infidelity and ignorance of God.</P>
<P>I HAVE already &s;ugge&s;ted the &s;upplications and &s;acrifices of the Romans for wi&s;dom in the faire&s;t era of their commonwealth; farther to inforce the duty, as incumbent upon tho&s;e that are intru&s;ted with the affairs of &s;tates and empires, let me call your recollection to the attention paid to it by the renowned leaders of that people who&s;e hi&s;tory is handed down in the &s;acred pages. Mo&s;es, their
<PB N="15" REF="020253_0014_0FAE9CBA868D3F00">
lawgiver and deliverer, was a man of prayer, and though he had the &s;pecial tokens of the divine pre&s;ence with him, in the pillars of cloud and fire, to be his general directors; yet, on various emer|gencies, we find him pro&s;trate before Jehovah, &s;eeking &s;pecial guidance and direction, and de|precating evils that impended his people, and the effect of his prayers, not once nor twice, was the averting of tho&s;e evils, and proved the lengthening of their tranquility. David, no le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed for his valor than his piety, a&s;ked coun&s;el of the Lord in a great variety of in&s;tances. Solomon, his &s;on, the wi&s;e&s;t of men, when he was about &s;uc|ceeding his father in the throne of I&s;rael, mo&s;t ear|ne&s;tly be&s;ought the Lord for a wi&s;e and under&s;tand|ing heart, to guide him in his kingdom. And in what attitude did he ever appear more dignified and exalted! God granted him his reque&s;t, and what nation ever enjoyed greater power and pro&s;|perity, or ro&s;e to more exalted heights of national glory, than this, under his admini&s;tration, 'till he for&s;ook the Lord, and called upon Gods that could not &s;ave? Hezekiah be&s;ought the Lord for a way of e&s;cape, in a mo&s;t critical and threatening &s;ituation, and the Lord opened it for him, and re&s;tored pro&s;perity. Jeho&s;aphat, in like circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="16" REF="020253_0015_0FAE9CB48A9AAA8">
fell pro&s;trate before the Lord, and in the&s;e expre&s;&s;ive laconic terms, poured forth his heart: Our God&mdash;we know not what to do: but our eyes are upon thee. And he &s;tood &s;till, and &s;aw the &s;alvation of God. What need I more &s;ay?&mdash;the time would fail me to mention the in&s;tances that might be adduced from the rulers of I&s;rael and Judah. Let it &s;uffice to ob&s;erve, that in them was verified that ob&s;ervation of the wi&s;e&s;t of their kings, that when the righteous were in authority, the people rejoiced; but when the wicked bore rule, the people mourned.</P>
<P>As we have examples of attention to this duty in the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t characters, and of &s;ucce&s;s following it, &s;o we are not de&s;titute of in&s;tances of unwi&s;e admini&s;tration, and fooli&s;h re&s;olves, a&s;crib|ed to the neglect of this duty. The children of I&s;rael, impo&s;ed upon by the craft and &s;ubtilty of the Gibeonites, entered into a league with them, which was injurious to their intere&s;ts, and led them to violate the expre&s;s injunctions of Jehovah; and this their ra&s;h and unwi&s;e procedure is a&s;cribed to their neglect to a&s;k coun&s;el of the Lord. They that honor God he will honor, and they that de&s;|pi&s;e him he will lightly e&s;teem. The moral rea|&s;ons

of God's government are ever the &s;ame, and they who neglect to a&s;k coun&s;el of the Lord mu&s;t expect to have their councils turned into fooli&s;h|ne&s;s, to meet darkne&s;s in their paths, &s;ee confu&s;ion in their mea&s;ures, and find them&s;elves entangled in the maze of their own errors.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job &s;peaking of the Great God in his providential gov|ernment, &s;ays, "He leadeth coun&s;ellors away &s;poiled, and maketh the judges fools.

If the circulating medium could be increa&s;ed, it would probably afford &s;ome relief in our pre&s;ent exigencies; and, if the legi&s;|lature of New-Hamp&s;hire are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fancied philo&s;opher's &s;tone, or the fabled tran&s;mu|ting touch of Midas, they might li&s;ten to a pro|po&s;al of paper-money; but if they are not, rea&s;on and experience reprobate the mea&s;ure, as having a direct tendency to put out of circulation every &s;hilling of hard money, as a mean of further em|barra&s;&s;ment, and an engine of oppre&s;&s;ion, fraud, and cruelty, and no wi&s;dom, human or divine, can dictate a mea&s;ure that leads to &s;uch evils. As in divinity there can be no faith contrary to rea&s;on, &s;o in politics there can be no wi&s;dom contrary to righteou&s;ne&s;s. "Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation, but &s;in is the reproach of any people." Righteou&s;|ne&s;s is the rule of God's admini&s;tration, and ought to be the rule of theirs who reign or decree ju&s;tice by him. Maxims of convenience, or even of &s;up|po&s;ed

<P>THE only probable way of increa&s;ing the cir|culating medium, to the benefit of the public, is by giving up, forever, the idea of paper-money; and by a &s;trict regard to ju&s;tice in all public mea|&s;ures, re&s;toring to men of property in the govern|ment a confidence, that when they have parted

<P>THE time would fail me to particularize the im|portant matters that will engage your attention, but whatever they may be, in them all acknow|ledge God, and he will direct your &s;teps; delibe|rate upon them in his fear; and if you lack wi&s;|dom, a&s;k of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not. This habitual application to God, for guidance and direction, will not only &s;ecure you the &s;ecret influence you need, as it is God's appointed method of be&s;towing it, but it will have a natural tendency to bring coolne&s;s and candor into your debates, to form your minds to that &s;erene and placid &s;tate, which, like the un|ruffled &s;urface of the water, reflects the images of objects ju&s;t as they are, and it will &s;uppre&s;s that prejudice and partiality, tho&s;e heated pa&s;&s;ions and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions from which the greate&s;t minds are not free, but which form as fal&s;e a medium of vi&s;ion as the agitated &s;urface of the troubled deep. The mind that has reached the Throne of Grace in

elevated devotion, in retiring from that place of &s;erenity and calmne&s;s, will bring a tincture of the region into the legi&s;lative areopagus, and &s;pread a lu&s;tre all around him, re&s;embling the lu&s;tre of Mo&s;es' face when he came from Mount Sinai from immediate conver&s;e with God.</P>
<P>LET me, then, again recommend to you the direction of the text, a&s;k coun&s;el of the Lord, call upon him, not only upon &s;et and formal occa&s;ions, in public and in &s;ecret, but whenever your deci&s;ion is called for, upon any important matter, let the devout breath|ing of your heart, to him that teacheth man know|ledge, prepare you to judge for him who is with you in the judgment; nor need you &s;ay who &s;hall a&s;cend to Heaven to bring God down from above: he &s;tandeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the Gods. Nor are &s;uch ejaculatory addre&s;&s;es without precedent or precept.</P>
<P>NEHEMIAH, while he was cup-bearer to king Artaxerxes, and was performing the du|ties of his office in the pre&s;ence of his royal ma&s;|ter, lifted up his heart to God for direction and

<P>I AM not unapprehen&s;ive that many have been &s;urprized at the choice of our &s;ubject on this oc|ca&s;ion, and will be di&s;appointed, that they have not been amu&s;ed with a di&s;&s;ertation upon the nature of civil government, the character of civil rulers, the dignity of their office, and its impor|tance to the world. They may wonder that they have heard nothing of the natural and political advantages of this country, and its pro&s;pects of future eminence and glory.

<P>WHEN a beautiful edifice &s;tands firm on its foundation, the &s;pectator may ju&s;tly amu&s;e him|&s;elf in contemplating its &s;ymmetry, proportions, ornaments, and pro&s;pects; but, if it were totter|ing to its fall, he would be unpardonable to be thus employed, and neglect every effort to &s;u&s;tain and re&s;tore it.</P>
<P>I HAVE predicted the future glory of America; yet nothing but an attention to the duty that has now been recommended, and a con&s;equent con|duct, corre&s;pondent to it, will verify that pre|diction.</P>
<P>OUR political &s;ituation is not le&s;s hazardous or threatening than was the real &s;ituation of the ma|riners with Jonah, when Heathen could exclaim,
