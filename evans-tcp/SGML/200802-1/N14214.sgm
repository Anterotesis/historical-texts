<P>IN this di&s;cour&s;e, I have u&s;ed all plainne&s;s and &s;implicity, both of &s;entiment, and &s;tyle, agreeable to the nature, &s;olemnity and importance of the &s;ubject; as al&s;o &s;uitable to the de&s;ign of the aged Mini&s;ter's &s;erious addre&s;s to the People, in the ca&s;e of life and death in a moral view.</P>

<P>IT is with &s;elf diffidence, that I venture it out to public no|tice, and mu&s;t a&s;k the readers candour; but, would humbly commit it to the divine ble&s;&s;ing and influence, to render it &s;a|vingly profitable to the fathers, and their children after them.</P>

<HEAD>A PREFACE. DEDICATORY TO THE CHURCH AND CONGREGATI|ON, UNDER MY PASTORAL CARE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR PEOPLE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT the invitation of your fathers, long &s;ince departed, I came hither in October, 1716.&mdash;After &s;ome proper time, with the people on probation; had their unanimous call, to &s;ettle with them, in the work of the mini&s;try, and accordingly was ordained thereunto in November, 1717.</P>
<P>AT the expiration of <HI>fifty years,</HI> from my ordination, I gave you an half century di&s;cour&s;e, in November, 1767, from 1 Pet. i. 12, 13. "Wherefore, I will not be negligent to put you al|ways in remembrance of the&s;e things, although you know them, and be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the pre&s;ent truth; yea, I think it mu&s;t, as long as I am in the tabernacle, to &s;tir you up, by putting you in remembrance; knowing that &s;hortly, I mu&s;t put off this taber|nacle, even as our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath &s;hewed me. More|over, I will endeavour, that you may be able after my decea&s;e, to have the&s;e things always in remembrance."</P>
<P>WHICH di&s;cour&s;e, at the de&s;ire you have had among you, and at the revolution of every year &s;ince that period, I have given you a di&s;cour&s;e, on &s;ome &s;uitable &s;ubject for the occa&s;ion: to re|mind my &s;elf, and you, of the riches of God's forbearance to|wards us: of our increa&s;ing obligations to fill up our &s;wiftly pa&s;|&s;ing time, with duty to God, and u&s;efulne&s;s to man. And that, with a ju&s;t and practical regard, and reverence to the invi&s;ible, untried &s;tate beyond the grave.</P>
<P>At the completion of the la&s;t year, I began a di&s;cour&s;e, from tho&s;e &s;olemn affecting words of Mo&s;es, Deut. xxx. 19. "I call
<PB N="vi" REF="018003_0005_0FA414E0626E54C0">
heaven and earth to record this day again&s;t you, that I have &s;et life and death before you; choo&s;e ye life," &amp;c.</P>
<P>AND now, at the &s;ixty-fir&s;t year of my mini&s;try, I rea&s;&s;umed the important &s;ubject, with enlargements; if po&s;&s;ible, (through grace) to have my own heart and your's, deeply impre&s;&s;ed with things &s;o &s;olemn and intere&s;ting as are contained therein: for it &s;urely becomes mini&s;ters to u&s;e all means within the compa&s;s of their office and ability, for their own, and people's &s;afety and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT, notwith&s;tanding all the means of grace, here and there; and methods of providence al&s;o; even the very "terrible things in righteou&s;ne&s;s;" of late, there have been a mo&s;t evident decay of piety, and growing corruption of manners. Yea, more e&s;pe|cially &s;ince the commencement of the pre&s;ent war, which has &s;pread iniquity more than equal to de&s;olation; replete with all manner of dreadfuls, and &s;till increa&s;ing; which aggravates the di&s;ea&s;ed guilty &s;tate of the land, and heightens their danger.</P>
<P>THIS with other rea&s;ons, hath induced me to give you the&s;e anniver&s;ary di&s;cour&s;es from the &s;olemn and awakning words of Mo&s;es, before recited: in hopes, that by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, the &s;ame may be of &s;ervice to excite &s;ome proper reflections in the more <HI>thoughtle&s;s cla&s;s</HI> of mankind, who have expo&s;ed them|&s;elves to the witne&s;s of God and con&s;cience again&s;t them, for their great neglect of religion and &s;alvation to this day&mdash;and to awaken re&s;olutions in the <HI>more &s;erious,</HI> to improve better than ever their day, and advantages for the&s;e worthy purpo&s;es.&mdash;As al&s;o, to promote the revival of religion, in <HI>the be&s;t,</HI> &s;o much needed in this day of mo&s;t awful declen&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have always had a large field of bu&s;ine&s;s here; many to mini&s;ter unto, not only publickly&mdash;but al&s;o privately, through
<PB N="vii" REF="018003_0006_0FA414E163EE1EC0">
all their changing &s;cenes of life. While, with as great proprie|ty, (as in any in&s;tance) might &s;ay, "who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things?" And though I fear, as to many, I have laboured in vain; yet humbly hope, that thro' grace have had &s;ome fruit un|to God, in this place; as I may ob&s;erve to the glory of God, that in &s;ome of the fir&s;t years of my mini&s;try, there have been &s;e|veral &s;ea&s;ons, whereto appeared marks of a divine work upon the hearts of men, attended with la&s;ting good fruits in the life. And though in later years, there hath not been ob&s;erved any thing of the like extent, yet hopefully &s;ome in&s;tances of conver|&s;ion, and &s;piritual edification, &s;ome tokens of the &s;pirit's influ|ence, at lea&s;t as the &s;mall gleanings of the vintage.</P>
<P>Now the importance of our &s;ubject from the words of Mo&s;es, when ju&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> his life and mini&s;try, together with the proba|bility that this may be the la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e from me, of this kind; may excu&s;e me in giving them on to you, that they may be with you, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">hen I can &s;peak to you no more, but in &s;uch a form as this. And this by the grace of God, be more effectual to you, and children after you, than the perfect mode of &s;peaking hath been.</P>
<P>You will then take it as a kind of la&s;t and dying advice to you and yours in after time&mdash;Oh receive in unto the very heart, that "life and death are &s;et before you," and &s;ee to it, that you are not witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t for refu&s;ing life, and ru&s;hing on to death a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> all authority and grace, until the door of hope be &s;hut, and there be no remedy&mdash;Agreeable hereunto, &s;uffer me to urge it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> you in the language of the text, that "ye choo&s;e life that both you and your children may live." And for particu|lars, refer you to the coun&s;el given you and children, in the clo|&s;ing part of the following di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>To &s;ay no more here, only this&mdash;in all your religion, re&s;t not

without integrity of heart; for without this, all fails of God's acceptance, and of &s;aving advantage to our&s;elves, therefore it is of the highe&s;t importance that we do not re&s;t in pompous ceremonies, parod<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, and &s;how in religion, not yet in attend|ing the externals of it, even though the whole circle thereof; but realize the nece&s;&s;ity of being <HI>God's workman&s;hip,</HI> created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us <HI>unto good works.</HI> Can there be a right &s;pirit in our religion, without a new heart at bottom? And 'tis uprightne&s;s with God and men that is connected "with the Saviour of God, which is life." Now, as religion is the <HI>be&s;t thing</HI> any have, better than riches, honour, &amp;c. So the corruption of it by er|rors in doctrine, e&s;pecially capital ones; or by hypocri&s;y in practice, is <HI>the wor&s;t;</HI> mo&s;t odious to the God of truth and puri|ty. It mu&s;t be fixed in our minds, that a right evangelical tem|per of the heart, is the &s;oul and life of all religion; the orna|ment and glory of them that have it; the very dre&s;s of the "King's daughters that is all glorious within," and much &s;o without. 'Tis the upright that God beholds with approbation and plea&s;ure now: and who &s;hall have dominion in the morning of the re&s;urrection, when they &s;hall ri&s;e to reign and be with Chri&s;t forever? Beyond all expre&s;&s;ion and conception, happy in the everla&s;ting abodes of con&s;ummate felicity above.</P>

<HEAD>THE AGED MINISTER'S SOLEMN APPEAL TO GOD, AND SERIOUS ADDRESS TO HIS PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>DEUTERONOMY. xxx. 19.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>I call heaven and earth to record this day again&s;t you, that I have &s;et before you life and death, ble&s;&s;ing and cur&s;ing: therefore choo&s;e life, that both thou and thy &s;eed may live.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AT this &s;ea&s;on, I &s;hall re&s;ume the &s;ubject, introduced on tho la&s;t. The &s;ubject is important enough to bear taking up a &s;econd time. Al&s;o to have &s;ome recapitulation of what was &s;aid the year before&mdash;and copeous enough to admit of the de&s;igned enlargement at this time. I have before, endeavoured to ex|plain the &s;olemn truths and duties, contained in the words. I &s;hall now briefly go over again with &s;ome of the capital articles, and leading &s;entiments before given out; and then after reciting the la&s;t year's introduction to the whole, proceed to what re|mains on the &s;ubject. Truly, my hearers, the words I have read to you, mo&s;t &s;olemn and affecting, are worthy our atten|tion, and &s;olicitude to &s;hare in the good of them.</P>
<P>I have no &s;ooner recited this &s;acred &s;triking pa&s;&s;age, and you have reflected on the occa&s;ion of my u&s;ing it; but your thoughtful minds, with your fixed eyes, do view me as one draw|ing near to the clo&s;e of his life and mini&s;try. You will then
<PB N="10" REF="018003_0009_0FA414E3600CCDB0">
&s;eriou&s;ly attend unto me, as a dying mini&s;ter preaching to dy|ing men, (though now) to a congregation that will mo&s;tly &s;ur|vive me, who have &s;urvived by far, the mo&s;t of the congrega|tion I began to preach unto.</P>
<P>WHEN Mo&s;es looked upon his work among his people to be near done, in&s;piration taught him to give them a recapitulation of tho&s;e things he had delivered to them from God&mdash;the great <HI>doctrines</HI> of religion to guide their faith&mdash;and <HI>precepts</HI> thereof to govern their practice&mdash;together with the <HI>&s;tatutes and ordinances</HI> of God, to direct their wor&s;hip. As al&s;o, his <HI>promi&s;es</HI> to encou|rage their obedience; yea, and his <HI>threatnings</HI> to deter them from di&s;obedience: and then &s;ums up the whole, under the emphari|cal expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>life and death, ble&s;&s;ing and cur&s;ing,</HI> which he had plainly &s;et before them in the cour&s;e of his mini&s;try, humbly ap|pealing to God, that he had &s;o done; then mo&s;t affectionately addre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf to the people of his charge.</P>
<P>"THEREFORE, choo&s;e ye life, that both thou and thy &s;eed may live." With re&s;pect to all this, Mo&s;es &s;aith, "I call hea|ven and earth to record this day," this day of my very advanced age, when &s;oon, very &s;oon, you will hear me no more. God and your own con&s;ciences te&s;tify again&s;t you, who notwith&s;tand|ing all that God has done for you, and by me, hath &s;aid unto you, have continued in your &s;in and neglect of duty. And &s;o a|gain&s;t all tho&s;e, who, hereafter are found thus di&s;obedient. All the&s;e implying that the &s;ame which is witne&s;s again&s;t the guilty, is witne&s;s for the obedient now and hereafter.</P>
<P>So that upon the whole, the &s;olemn words of my text may be thought applicable on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, both as they look <HI>back</HI> (in <HI>a moral view</HI>) upon the like general cour&s;e of a mini&s;ter's con|duct in his &s;pecial office, and on the people's behaviour, under
<PB N="11" REF="018003_0010_0FA414E4295A74D0">
the preaching of the word; and al&s;o as looking <HI>forward</HI> unto fu|ture duty, and the eternal &s;tate, which the moral conduct of mini&s;ters and people &s;tand related unto. Whence I ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>I. THAT the &s;um of a mini&s;ter's duty, is to &s;et life and death the ble&s;&s;ing and the cur&s;e, before the people of his charge. This general phra&s;e includes all the particulars of a mini&s;ter's duty, as it is de&s;igned to &s;peak out the <HI>good</HI> of religion and &s;alvation, and the <HI>evil</HI> of &s;in and de&s;truction: yea, this doth mean that the mi|ni&s;ter is to &s;et before the people the whole &s;y&s;tem of religion, with all the doctrines and precepts of it, &amp;c. together with the obligations to faith and practice, according to the divine requi|&s;ition. In a word, he is to preach the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, which eminently holds up life to the believer, who is careful to main|tain good works; and mo&s;t certainly &s;huts out from life the un|believer, and di&s;obedient: and all the preacher has in charge to &s;ay to the people, he is to <HI>&s;et before them</HI> in a plain, intelligible and engaging manner, not hide any part of God's council from them by ob&s;curity of language, or artful repre&s;entation of &s;crip|ture, to turn off people's minds from the ju&s;t &s;en&s;e they have</P>
<P>II. OBSERVE when the mini&s;ter is drawing near to the clo&s;e of his life and mini&s;try, there is a &s;pecial propriety in his remind|ing them of this, that he has by the grace of God been &s;etting life and death before them in the cour&s;e of his mini&s;try: often opening the way of life by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and di&s;playing the ter|rors of the Lord again&s;t the unbelieving and di&s;obedient. Now the mini&s;ters declaring this with a &s;olemn appeal to God and their conciences, has a tendency to put people upon &s;olemnly ex|amining how they have heard and improved, under the means of grace and life. And what would likely be their ca&s;e, if they &s;hould now be called hence? This al&s;o tends to &s;olemnize the
<PB N="12" REF="018003_0011_0FA414E4E02E6F10">
mini&s;ter's own heart, unto the better fini&s;hing his cour&s;e of mi|ni&s;try and life, and to the giving account of his &s;teward&s;hip, with the <HI>joy of the faithful in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>III. I ob&s;erved, that of the mini&s;ter, upon a ju&s;t examina|tion of him&s;elf; is con&s;cious, that by the grace of God, he has plainly and faithfully &s;et life and death before the people of his charge: he may then humbly appeal to God, and their con&s;ci|ences, that he hath &s;o done.&mdash;<HI>Mo&s;es</HI> fully &s;atisfied in this point, could and did call heaven and earth to witne&s;s hereunto: as al|&s;o to witne&s;s again&s;t the di&s;obedient, and for the obedient. And whoever &s;ince have obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful; that in &s;ome mea&s;ure they have been &s;o, may in &s;ome imitation of Mo&s;es, make the &s;ame kind of appeal.</P>
<P>Now, this may add weight to what mini&s;ters &s;ay in God's name, and people thus hear from God. This al&s;o &s;hews 'tis of great importance, that the word be well &s;poken, and well attended unto. For, that God is witne&s;s, and that con&s;cience is witne&s;s to the whole, is what demands the attention both of mini&s;ters and people, unto their duty&mdash;Yes, &s;urely, it mu&s;t be of great im|portance, that <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> "do preach only the preaching that God kids them," and that <HI>the people</HI> do hear the word, as it is in|deed the word of God, and not of man: that they hear, as for their lives, for indeed the life of the immortal &s;oul, is intimate|ly concerned herein. Again, I ob&s;erved,</P>
<P>IV. THAT the &s;olemnity of this appeal, together with the im|portance of the whole matter, may well put mini&s;ters upon ex|horting their people to choo&s;e life. And this as excited hereun|to by the good of it, to them&s;elves and their children, "that both they and their feed may <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">."</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="018003_0012_0FA414E6E6758908">
SUCH a &s;olemn appeal to God (as Mo&s;es doth here make) may well be attended with a &s;erious addre&s;s to the people; when Mo|&s;es had &s;et life and death before the people, in this &s;triking con|tra&s;t, i. e. with the glory of the one, and terror of the other, that they might have the argument in its full force opened to them, to gain their intelligent and free choice of life. Then like a faithful compa&s;&s;ionate friend to them, he adds and &s;ays, in the language of mo&s;t pathetic addre&s;s&mdash;"Therefore choo&s;e ye life, that both thou and thy &s;eed may live." This was to &s;trike every pa&s;&s;ion, reach all the feelings of the intelligent con|&s;cious heart, and the&s;e of the parent, for the dear pieces of them|&s;elves. I then went on to the</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>I. USE, from this &s;ubject, we learn the high importance of mini&s;ter's being very faithful in their work, which their com|mi&s;&s;ion, character and &s;acred office, doth loudly &s;peak them obliged unto. No room for their &s;olemn appeal to God, with|out faithfulne&s;s in his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>II. USE, whatever there was to recommend unto I&s;rael of old, the duty urged in the text, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> to chu&s;e religion and life connected therewith; taken from the high character and &s;ignal hi&s;tory of Mo&s;es, which no meer man may pretend to;&mdash;Yet there is now and always, enough in the worth of life, and terror of death; as well as argument enough from the author, and na|ture of religion, to recommend the advice in our text. <HI>Therefore choo&s;e life,</HI> and &s;o enough to recommend religion, to mens attention, and practice, in all ages. <HI>Life</HI> in the &s;en&s;e of the text is what it is, &s;ome permanent good, which is known in &s;crip|ture as that important &s;omething, which connects the &s;oul of man with the Deity, in who&s;e <HI>favour is life.</HI> So that it may be de&s;|cribed and known by the name of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to God, nearne&s;s to
<PB N="14" REF="018003_0013_0FA414E86CDEE488">
him, as fixed in the favour and friend&s;hip of God forever,&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> the &s;ame as unlikne&s;s to God, &s;eperation from him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> forever, the &s;ame as everla&s;ting di&s;tance from God, the only &s;ource of life, which mu&s;t amount to de&s;truction, "for &s;o they that are far from him do of cour&s;e peri&s;h." God is the &s;ame, without the lea&s;t &s;hadow of change, his perfections, authority, and grace do always require religion, the &s;ame for &s;ub&s;tance under all di&s;pen&s;ations, and as the nature of true and &s;aving religion, is always the &s;ame; &s;o it always hath reference to another &s;tate of Being. Therefore it is of eternal con&s;equence to us, that we be found to have cho&s;en life and the way that leads unto it, omitting any mention of &s;everal affecting &s;enti|ments in the application, the la&s;t year, I &s;hall now, go on, to the de&s;igned enlargement&mdash;and infer from the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>III. THAT religion is no vague, uncertain trifling bu&s;ine&s;s, very far from this; when it is our conformity to God, and communion with him, our only road to eternel life. 'Tis indeed, too &s;erious, &s;olemn, and intere&s;ting a bu&s;ine&s;s to be trifled with. Due thoughts of the author, and object of it; as al&s;o of the dignity and con&s;equences of it; utterly forbid treating <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, in a loo&s;e way, with a licentious mind, that breaks over rule, and rangeth want|only in the field of wild imagination. It mu&s;t rather be treated with &s;olid judgment and exactne&s;s; for it is a very critical and delicate bu&s;ine&s;s, by no means to be trifled with.</P>

RELIGION, is al&s;o a very <HI>delicate thing,</HI> and cannot bear any thing to fully its beauty; and darken its glory, it will not bear with heterogeneous things; jaring principles, and e&s;pecially di&s;|cordant with the &s;tandard of orthodoxy. Nor will it bear with in|&s;tability, off an on, as if it were <HI>a vague bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> neither certain|ly this or that, it implys unexampled prece&s;&s;ion, the very thing, that God hath determined; exactly this, and no other. It is of God, and mu&s;t be e&s;teemed what he has &s;aid, and doth require, and &s;o to remain permanant like his "word which abide, for ever." never to be altered at the will of man, as if he may &s;hew him&s;elf weary of truth, and &s;trictne&s;s. We mu&s;t abide by its very principles, and continue &s;teaddy in the practice, for God's honor, and our own happine&s;s, as he has de&s;igned it; view, and u&s;e it as an in&s;titution worthy of God; fitted for us, both dignifying and beautifying to us, &s;o that, God is jealous for the honor due to him, in the way of our faithfullne&s;s and &s;teady practice. There mu&s;t not be any &s;hifting here, to &s;uit the times, no kind of trifling here. In a word, true religion will not bear with ficklene&s;s, hypocri&s;y or &s;loth; or any &s;uch thing that is unfriendly to the power of it.</P>
<P>Now then, if religion be of &s;o fine and delicate a con&s;titution, &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of injury by oppo&s;ition, and even by mi&s;take, tak|ing that for doctrine and principle, which was no place in reli|gion; and that for its bu&s;ine&s;s, which the laws of religion ad|mit not; al&s;o con&s;idering the noble end which religion is fitted to promote. The glory of the Deity, and our own happy im|mortality; it mu&s;t certainly be of the greate&s;t importance, that we have ju&s;t notions of, and pay a faithful regard thereunto. And this, as ever we would not be found to have affronted the author of its and our&s;elves &s;uffer accordingly. For religion is &s;tamped with a divine authority, and trifling in it threatens our lo&s;s of heaven.</P>

SURELY then the in&s;tituting it for the end above &s;aid, is not a wa&s;te of divine wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s, &amp;c. which &s;trongly argues, that it mu&s;t not be neglected or trifled with. Here the life and death &s;et before us, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, and will it do, (my hearers) to trifle in the ca&s;e of life and death.</P>
<P>IV. USE of exhortation to you and your's; "therefore choo&s;e life, that you may live, that both <HI>you and your children</HI> may live." But as life is a per&s;onal happine&s;s, and religion a per&s;onal thing, how will the parent's religion and choo&s;ing life &s;erve the life of the children? Why to be &s;ure it may be &s;o, as here is a fair ex|ample, by the wi&s;dom and religion of the parents, for the chil|dren to copy after; they beholding their parents &s;trictly religi|ous, and conducting as per&s;ons who have cho&s;en the better part, and bound for heaven; may be awakened to a ju&s;t &s;olicitude about the&s;e important things, according to that, "train up a child in the way wherein he &s;hould go," &amp;c.</P>
<P>HERE is Mo&s;es's addre&s;s to the people of his charge, that they choo&s;e life to the end, that both they and their &s;eed may live. Well explained and urged in the following words, "that thou mighte&s;t love the Lord, and that thou mighte&s;t cleave unto him, for he is thy life;" which all &s;hews that to choo&s;e life, im|plies the choice and exerci&s;e of religion here &s;ummed up, in loving the Lord our God, with all our hearts, and cleaving to him in our whole life.</P>
<P>Now then, &s;o far as I may u&s;e the words of Mo&s;es, which in|deed are expre&s;&s;ive of the divine council and compa&s;&s;ion; let them be duly regarded by us, and this be &s;een in a practical re|&s;pect to the one thing needful, in the well proved "choice of that better part, which cannot be taken away."</P>

HOWEVER &s;en&s;ible of my failures in the office of a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t; yet, I hope I may, in &s;ome feeble imitation of Mo&s;es, call heaven and earth to record this day; that I have by the grace of God been &s;etting life and death before you, in the cour&s;e of my mini&s;try among you, which now completes &s;ixty-one years, &s;ince my ordination: and may I not hope that through the di|vine ble&s;&s;ing accompanying the word, I have been in&s;trumental of the conver&s;ion and edification of &s;ome; while yet ju&s;tly to be lamented, that many have not believed the report of the go&s;pel, may there in future time, be greater numbers believe and turn to the Lord.</P>

THE importance of our &s;ubject, and my &s;ituation as near done &s;peaking to you, may give me warrant to give, and engage you to take the following as a kind of la&s;t and dying advice to you and your children, all agreeable to that of Mo&s;es, "therefore choo&s;e life, that both thou and thy &s;eed may live." To be more particular in &s;ome &s;et form of advice,</P>
<P>I. BE e&s;tabli&s;hed firmly in the belief of this prime truth, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that "<HI>God is,</HI> and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him," which is the foundation of all religion. In this Athie&s;tical age, very eminently &s;o, when &s;o many, at lea&s;t practi|cally deny the exi&s;tence of a God, as &s;upreme law-giver and judge&mdash;that "live without God in the world," as if there was no God to give law unto them and judge them; let me &s;olemn|ly repeat it, and pre&s;&s;ingly urge, that you have your hearts a&s;|&s;ured of this great truth, that certainly there is a God, one all perfect Being, nece&s;&s;arily and unchangeably what he is; the grand ba&s;is of all religion. For, if there is no God, it could not with any propriety be &s;aid, "if there be any virtue, if there be any prai&s;e think on the&s;e things," as there could not be any &s;uch thing to employ the mind, &s;ince virtue and Godline&s;s hath a ne|ce&s;&s;ary relation to the certain exi&s;tence and perfections of deity, to require and reward the &s;ame. Therefore if any Athie&s;tical thoughts or de&s;ires be ever &s;ugge&s;ted to you, re&s;i&s;t them, with vehement indignation, as infinitely impious and ab&s;urd. For it is "<HI>the feel</HI> that even in his heart, <HI>&s;aith there is no God,</HI>" which is to deny both his Maker and his own exi&s;tence at one &s;troke, and at once di&s;lodge all thoughts of religion, virtue and happine&s;s; and what a &s;trange kind of being mu&s;t man be, without virtue and religion, as his proper exerci&s;e and bu&s;ine&s;s, and without God as the only true happine&s;s of an intelligent creature.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="018003_0018_0FA50B579DE08B58">
II. BE e&s;tabli&s;hed in this, that God (mo&s;t high, yet conver|&s;able with men) hath by his own gracious revelation, opened a conver&s;e with fallen man, through his own &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the great medium of our intercour&s;e with heaven, and only Media|tor of our prayers and prai&s;es, and all our religion: in a word, God's way to us, and our's to him by faith.</P>
<P>III. BE a&s;&s;ured of this, that the &s;criptures of the old and new Te&s;tament, are the word of God: that they naturally prove the divinity of each other, as the former predictions in the old Te&s;|tament, having their accompli&s;hment by facts of later date rela|ted in the new Te&s;tament, do prove that all &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God. Thus Chri&s;t him&s;elf alledgeth that his Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip and character, as he, &s;on of God, and Saviour of men, is given out and proved by the writings of Mo&s;es; for &s;ays he, "they are they, which te&s;tify of me; of me as I now appear, and am manife&s;ted in the very character foretold of the Me&s;&s;iah." Moreover, as the miracles of Mo&s;es proved the di|vinty of his writings, &s;o the unconte&s;table miracles of Je&s;us Chri&s;t proved the divinity of his go&s;pel: e&s;pecially his re&s;urrection from the dead, evident to his di&s;ciples, was, and is clear proof of this. Further the divinity of the &s;acred &s;criptures, appears from the di|vine excellency of the matter the inimitable maje&s;ty of the &s;tyle, compo&s;ed of greatne&s;s and &s;implicity, as no other writings are. So is the power and efficacy of the word of God upon the mind and con&s;cience, &s;trong proof of the point in hand. Yea, this &s;ame e&s;pecial evidence of the divine authority of the word, according to the de&s;ign of Jer. iii. 28, 29. adduced to this very purpo&s;e; "for, what is the chaff to the wheat? Is not my word like fire, and like as a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?" Now then, is not the given characters of the word of God, when verified by the work of the divine &s;pirit on the mind and heart, good proof of the divine authority thereof.

And all this effected by the &s;pirit. So it fol|lows, that when per&s;ons are convinced of &s;in, converted to God, and comforted in this way, by this means; and all this evidenced by fruits, which the word marks out as genuine; here is good proof of the divinity of the &s;criptures; in that God him&s;elf, doth hereby &s;et to his &s;eal, in confirmation of the truth of them. By this it appears, that his authority is really &s;tamped upon them; and that they are indeed the word of God, and not of man, and to be taken by us, as "the faithful &s;aying, worthy of all ac|ceptation." Then let it be &s;ettled upon your hearts, that the di|vine Revelation is to apo&s;tate man, the only &s;ure and &s;ufficient rule of faith and practice, morally fitted to be the means of our conver&s;ion to God, and forming for heaven.</P>

IV. BE then very careful to &s;et out right in the <HI>theory of reli|gion;</HI> for a mi&s;take here, if it be a mi&s;take as to the grand e&s;&s;enti|al doctrines of it; is a fundamental error, and not corrected, will be fatal by erring in vi&s;ion, we are expo&s;ed to &s;tumble in judgment, and practice too. You are al&s;o in experience, but to receive and be well e&s;tabli&s;hed in the truth, as it is in Je&s;us in his go&s;pel; is the way to be <HI>&s;ound in the faith:</HI> as al&s;o in all prac|tical and experimental religion. El&s;e, why do we read of Chri&s;t's <HI>doctrine</HI> being <HI>according to Godline&s;s?</HI> And of <HI>the truth</HI> as being <HI>af|ter Godline&s;s?</HI> Plainly &s;hewing that every doctrine, not taken from the word of God, and that &s;tands not connected with true piety and religion, and no ways adapted to promote the &s;ame, is fal&s;e doctrine; not fit to be preached; not &s;afe to be heard, and believed. Expre&s;s is the Apo&s;tle upon this &s;ubject. "If any man teach otherwi&s;e, and con&s;ent not to whole&s;ome words of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the doctrine which we preach (that is according to Godline&s;&s;) he is perver&s;e, and knoweth nothing," therefore, "take heed what you hear, and that no man deceive you," and turn you a&s;ide from tho&s;e whole&s;ome words, and &s;o from the right ways of the Lord; and you wander in the wild maze of <HI>ignorance</HI> and <HI>error,</HI> and peri&s;h forever. Oh! my bre|thren, &s;ee that you &s;et out right, and keep the road of truth and duty:" be not deceived, God "is not mocked;" the heart is ve|ry deceitful; &s;elf flattery "but too natural to depraved man." And &s;o there is an imbred prone&s;s to yield to the flattering &s;enti|ments of tho&s;e that lie in wait to deceive with their doc|trines, plea&s;ing to corrupt nature. Therefore, be on your guard, "not to be carried away with &s;trange doctrines,&mdash;with every wind of doctrine, to turn you from the faith once delivered to the &s;aints," and yet continued unto them.

V. BE well e&s;tabli&s;hed in the connection of internal religion and &s;alvation; the &s;ame as a connection of heart purity with a Chri&s;t. For as it is mo&s;t evident there is &s;alvation in no other, but Chri&s;t the one Mediator between God and man; and no inte|re&s;t in Chri&s;t without union to him; &s;o no union to him without faith, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ought in us in our effectual calling. Not &s;ome time <HI>after,</HI> but <HI>in it.</HI> According to &s;uch plain pa&s;&s;ages of &s;crip|ture as the&s;e. Eph. ii. 10. "We are his workman&s;hip created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, unto good works." John, i. 12. "As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the &s;ons of God." The regenerate are &s;ons of God, born of him by his &s;pirit: the&s;e are <HI>his workman&s;hip created in Chri&s;t,</HI> i. e. renewed <HI>in him</HI> as united <HI>to him.</HI> So that it &s;eems not agreeable to the language and &s;pirit of the bible; that we conceive of regenerati|on in the order of time, before faith in Chri&s;t. Doth God by his &s;pirit take a poor creature all in the rough, renew him in the whole man after his image, that he &s;hall love God &s;upremely, love his law as holy, and yet know nothing of Chri&s;t, and have no union to him by faith, while yet the &s;cripture &s;peaks of men's being the children of God by faith, Gal. iii. 26. The truth is, that regeneration is prior to faith, only in the order of nature, and of their conception of things. We conceive of <HI>God's drawing,</HI> and then of <HI>our coming;</HI> but really they are together. As God draws, we come. So <HI>Mr. Polbil</HI> de&s;cribes it, <HI>acta, agit.</HI> The &s;oul acted upon, doth act. Which appears to an&s;wer well to the de&s;cription of it. John, vi. 44. "No man cometh to the Son, but whom the Father draws." And what is his draw|ing if we come not? How is it an effectual calling if the extar|nal call doth not take with us, and we don't come to Chri&s;t as offered in the go&s;pel?</P>
<P>BE well informed in this point, according to the experience of
<PB N="23" REF="018003_0022_0FA414F0F07C0C60">
the church in Sol. Song, i. 4. "Draw me, we will run after thee." Is not regeneration the work of God within us, by which we are conformed to the <HI>image of his Son?</HI> Here is a Chri&s;t in|cluded in the bu&s;ine&s;s. And can this be without any connection with him; without any knowledge of him, or faith in him? In a word, it &s;eems that the renovation of our natures doth not take place, ab&s;tract from Chri&s;t, any more than the ju&s;tification of our per&s;ons. The Apo&s;tle is full here: &s;ee I Cor. i. 30. "But of him are ye <HI>in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> who of God is made unto us <HI>righteou&s;|ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>&s;anctification."</HI> And is it &s;afe to think we have the qua|lification for heaven? <HI>Heart</HI> purity, without a Chri&s;t formed in us the hope of glory.</P>
<P>Now, as religion is not any thing &s;aving to us, unle&s;s it be a per&s;onal powerful principle of obedience to God; &s;o this internal religion is what we have <HI>in our union to Chri&s;t by faith:</HI> the new creature is what it is <HI>in him,</HI> and cannot exi&s;t without him.</P>
<P>VI. BE well e&s;tabli&s;hed in the connection of God's in&s;tituted means, and the end propo&s;ed in our u&s;e of them. Now the &s;crip|tures abundantly &s;hew, that God hath in his infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, appointed external means with re&s;pect to our &s;alvati|on; yea, to our obtaining of &s;aving grace. Means, well adapt|ed to our <HI>nature</HI> as men, and to our <HI>&s;tate</HI> as &s;inners: means which he makes u&s;e of by his &s;pirit, for this purpo&s;e. As the &s;pirit takes of Chri&s;t and &s;heweth it unto us: and means which he re|quires us diligently and faithfully to attend on for his influence and ble&s;&s;ing, to make them effectual unto us. So that to &s;ay, "there is no &s;ort of connection between the means and the end;" is an un&s;criptural a&s;&s;ertion. Indeed, there is no cau&s;al or meri|torious connection, as if the means were thought to ri&s;e into the place and character of <HI>an Efficant,</HI> or that by the be&s;t u&s;e we can make of them we could merit grace and &s;alvation; yet there is
<PB N="24" REF="018003_0023_0FA414F1AE84B100">
&s;ome &s;ort of connection, &s;uch as is proper between means and end: and that the encrea&s;e or ble&s;&s;ing, is God's prerogative to give; yet Paul is to plant, and Apollos water, and we to attend thereon. For "faith comes by hearing the word preached," the means in&s;tituted for that end. Therefore, be you faithful in the u&s;e of the means left you fall under the cen&s;ure of tho&s;e that "frame not their doings (or ways) to turn unto the Lord," and fail of the ble&s;&s;ing to be obtained in the way of duty. This the ordinary way of it: to be &s;ure more likely than in the neg|lect of means. Examples in &s;cripture are full to this purpo&s;e. And is not our &s;anctification by the &s;pirit, <HI>through belief of the truth,</HI> which is revealed and preached to us, according to that in John, 17. where our Saviour is full in this? <HI>Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth.</HI> The written word contain|ing the means by which the &s;pirit doth his work. And is the means we are to u&s;e to this purpo&s;e, evident by that in Rom. 10? <HI>How &s;hall they hear without a preacher?</HI> Which &s;heweth there mu&s;t be <HI>preaching</HI> the word, and hearing it. And how comes <HI>faith</HI> ordinarily, but <HI>by hearing?</HI> Thus internal religion is form'd in us.</P>
<P>VII. SET out early and earne&s;tly in the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion, that divine &s;ervice you were eminently made for, and do owe to God that made you, and who only can make you happy. This advice is e&s;pecially addre&s;&s;ed to the youth, agreeable to that of Solomon's; "Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the evil days come," &amp;c. Intimating that the younger part of life is ordinarily mo&s;t free of evil days. Of &s;uch wherein is no plea&s;ure, except it be in religion.</P>
<P>BUT the advice is al&s;o proper for tho&s;e in elder life, delay no longer now, but early and earne&s;tly apply to this &s;erious bu&s;i|ne&s;s: whatever is your age now, delay no longer; for the put|ting
<PB N="25" REF="018003_0024_0FA414F26209F958">
off to a future day, under a notion of a more convenient &s;ea|&s;on, is a meer cheat, and danger enough, that be fatal: for they who put off to a morrow, are apt and want to do ju&s;t &s;o again, when the morrow comes; and &s;o on, till a morrow be no more delay, will co&s;t you bitter repentance here or hereafter.</P>
<P>AND dont think that a little religion will an&s;wer for God's acceptance and your &s;afety: only going on in a circle of external duties (if you were come to that) with an unhallowed heart, will not be enough to plea&s;e him, "with whom you have to do;" who &s;eeth not as man &s;eeth, but looketh on the heart. There|fore be very &s;olicitous to have the foundation laid in <HI>the &s;anctifi|cation of the &s;pirit unto obedience;</HI> in faith repentance, with &s;elf|-dedication to God, devotedne&s;s to him without re&s;erve, and be|yond revocation.</P>
<P>VIII. BE frequent and faithful in &s;elf-examination into your &s;tate and wants, &amp;c. which may be awakning to the &s;inner, and improving to the &s;aint. 'Tis a good guard again&s;t every kind of temptation, and friendly to every branch of religion. Yes, to be much at home communing with your own hearts, is a good way to be the more with God, in communion with him.</P>
<P>IX. CONSCIENCIOUSLY attend God's in&s;tituted wor&s;hip. Let not any trifling excu&s;es hinder you from con&s;tant attendance on it in <HI>public.</HI> Be &s;teady in <HI>family wor&s;hip,</HI> in reading the word and prayer. (not pa&s;&s;ing over that of the <HI>&s;olitary kind</HI>) Let there be no prayerle&s;s families among you; and let no family di&s;cord have place within your hou&s;e, le&s;t thereby your pray|ers be hindered. Let <HI>heads of families</HI> be faithful in the in&s;truc|tion and government thereof; teach your children and &s;ervants <HI>&s;ound doctrine, which only is unto Godly edifying.</HI> Train them up well, like Abraham, "command your hou&s;hold after you, to keep the way of the Lord."

And not a little with this view, that well regulated families, are the nur|&s;ery of the church and &s;tate in their glory; but that the community of every kind is extremely injured by irreligion and di&s;order in private families. Let <HI>children</HI> be obedient to their parents, as ever they would hope to &s;hare in the promi&s;e annexed in the 5th commandment. And <HI>&s;ervants</HI> chearfully obey their ma&s;ters in the Lord. Let all in <HI>early life</HI> be far from thinking they are ex|cu&s;ed in the vanities of children and youth, but rather attend to that advice, "young men and maidens (with old men and chil|dren) let them prai&s;e the name of the Lord." This a fit bu&s;i|ne&s;s in all ages, and through life. Let the <HI>aged</HI> be eminently &s;ober, grave, and of good behaviour, bringing forth fruit in old age to the glory of God, and their own comfort.</P>
<P>UNTO one and all ages and characters, let me &s;ay, that it &s;hould be a &s;ettled point with you, to be &s;trictly virtuous and re|ligious: fail not of any breach of duty, in the whole circle there|of. If <HI>moral virtue</HI> fail in your conduct, <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> cannot flou|ri&s;h. Therefore, "that which is altogether ju&s;t, &amp;c. thou &s;hall follow;" or can you think to be followers of Chri&s;t, act out the Chri&s;tian in every way required, &amp;c. in every thing called for, without a &s;trict regard to moral virtue, in all righteou&s;ne&s;s and charity?</P>
<P>BUT perhaps it will be &s;aid, how can &s;uch important matters be attended to, again&s;t the impetuous current of wickedne&s;s? Again&s;t all the embarra&s;&s;ments to virtue and religion, that crowd upon us, in times &s;o di&s;tracted and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing as the pre&s;ent? I reply, the &s;tate of our affairs, both in a political and moral view, do indeed wear a dark a&s;pect; e&s;pecially, as our abounding ini|quities and impieties do compo&s;e the darke&s;t part of the cloud that hangs over us; and mu&s;t needs &s;trike a thoughtful mind with
<PB N="27" REF="018003_0026_0FA414F4AF0DD660">
grief and lamentation; yet, and although <HI>Ichabod</HI> in &s;ome plain characters, is written upon this land; as the glory is awfully de|parted from us; &s;till, let not the mourners in Zion, who trem|ble for the ark of God, be di&s;couraged from con&s;tant fervent prayers for his return unto us, with his healing &s;aving mercy; nor be di&s;couraged from vigorous attempts of our reformation; for as God hath for his own name's &s;ake, &s;aved his people of old, when on the brink of ruin: &s;o, for his own name's &s;ake (&s;till as dear to him as ever) he may appear for us in our low e&s;tate, as many as our &s;ins are, and heavy as his judgments are; &s;ee Ezek. 22. where it is &s;aid four times over,&mdash;"I will pour out my fury," &amp;c. But I wrought for my name's &s;ake. Neverthele&s;s, mine eye pi|tied and &s;pared them from de&s;troying them. And for this rea|&s;on, as God him&s;elf &s;ays, <HI>becau&s;e I am God, and not man.</HI> As in Ho&s;ea, xi. 9. where, open to view, the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing &s;truggle between ju&s;tice and mercy, and mercy prevailing, "how &s;hall I give thee up Ephraim, &amp;c. mine heart is turned within me, and my repentings are kindled together? I will not return to de|&s;troy Ephraim in the fiercene&s;s of mine anger, but will &s;urely have mercy on him, for I am God and not man, &s;aith the Lord." A &s;imilar &s;urpri&s;ing pa&s;&s;age is that in I&s;a. lviii. 18. <HI>I have &s;een his ways, and will heal him:</HI> yes, the <HI>ways of my people,</HI> and there|fore greatly aggravated. Yet, as bad as they are, I will heal him. So he may for his name's &s;ake heal us of our back&s;lidings, and give us repentence unto life. But "for this he will be enquired of to do it for us." And, as a ju&s;t reflection on our abominable declen&s;ion from God, together with his terrible things in righte|ou&s;ne&s;s at this day, may awaken us to our duty. So God's com|pa&s;&s;ion (ever the &s;ame) may encourage us to &s;trive and pray for a reformation and the removal of his judgments. Shall we dare to indulge our &s;tupidity, till our iniquity complete our ruin; till our all is gone, pa&s;t recovery? The ca&s;e is fairly &s;tated thus, if ye
<PB N="28" REF="018003_0027_0FA414F5603A61A8">
live after the fle&s;h, (and continue to do &s;o) ye &s;hall die, and there is no remedy. And how can the &s;hort-lived plea&s;ures of &s;inful gratifications more than ballance the horrors of eternal de|&s;truction, as if it could not be wi&s;e, to be at the pains of &s;elf|mortification to e&s;cape it.</P>
<P>To revert for a moment to the fir&s;t paragraph under this la&s;t head of advice, and &s;ay, by no means for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling of your&s;elves together for public wor&s;hip; but be faithful and con&s;tant in the attendance on the in&s;titutions of God's hou&s;e, e&s;|pecially on the Lord's day; for, as &s;lackne&s;s in this, and as to the &s;trict ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath (as at this day) is an awful <HI>evidence</HI> of great declen&s;ions already taking place; &s;o if continu|ed, will be a terrible <HI>omen</HI> of mo&s;t threatning declen&s;ions to fol|low. Oh this being weary of Sabbaths, and God's wor&s;hip, do awfully expo&s;e us to God's ca&s;ting us off, to be no more his peo|ple; for though he bear long, he will not bear always. And if <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> be written upon us, wo to us: as &s;aid, "wo to them if I depart from them." But I would hope better things of you; and therefore proceed one &s;tep further by way of advice.</P>
<P>SPARE no pains in the Chri&s;tian work, or warfare, be very &s;olicitous for a &s;aving and &s;atisfying connection with Chri&s;t, give up your&s;elves to him by faith, love him &s;upremely, make much of him, more than any other beloved, infinitely more, e&s;pecial|ly as the Lord your only righteou&s;ne&s;s: live by the faith of the Son of God, &s;trictly follow him, walk circum&s;pectly, (i. e. look|ing all around you) to e&s;py danger from every quarter, from your own hearts, the world and Satan, as well as not to let any duty pa&s;s unnoticed: lay up your trea&s;ure in heaven, and have your hearts there as an evidence of this. Ever account it a prize worth contending for, and the &s;piritual warfare you mu&s;t be en|gaged in to obtain it; as you mu&s;t li&s;t under Chri&s;t's banner, &s;o
<PB N="29" REF="018003_0028_0FA414F71F93DCC0">
fight the good fight of faith, to lay hold, and keep hold of eter|nal life. Put on the whole armour of God, e&s;pecially the &s;hield of faith, and therewith u&s;e the &s;word of the &s;pirit, the word of God, to quench the fiery darts of the wicked one. Re&s;i&s;t temp|tation early, and give no place to the Devil: re&s;i&s;t him &s;tedfa&s;t|ly in the faith of Chri&s;t's power and merit, yea, in a humble confidence in his grace to be &s;ufficient for you. However ardu|ous the &s;truggle may be, be re&s;olute and courageous in the &s;piri|tual battle, with a reliance on Chri&s;t to be your &s;upport, and to give you the victory. Never give over as to any branch of the Chri&s;tian work or warfare, however much you may be afflicted with oppo&s;ition&mdash;but continue in well doing, and vigorous fight|ing. Shrink not back from the mo&s;t vigorous efforts in &s;o noble a cau&s;e: keep a good con&s;cience before, toward God and man: faithfully regard the dictates of a well enlightened con&s;cience in living well, and &s;ettling well the grand account for the la&s;t judg|ment. Oh then indulge not any thing that will not bear a look from God's all pervading eye; that will not bear a &s;ingle ca&s;t from his dread tribunal, much le&s;s the full glare of eternity.</P>
<P>THROUGH all life keep death and the future world in view, realizing their &s;wift approach. In this view, keep up the impor|tant &s;truggle for the prize of the high calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>IN the clo&s;e of the&s;e heads of advice, re&s;pecting faith and du|ty, I &s;hall only add, that whatever men believe and do, or feel and &s;uffer, even in the bitter reflections of con&s;cience, it all dont make up a righteou&s;ne&s;s to ju&s;tify them before God. No, the true faith, &s;incere obedience, and rich experience of eminent Chri&s;|tians, in the exerci&s;e of love to God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in repen|tance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &amp;c. have not any thing in them of the nature of an expiatory &s;acrifice
<PB N="30" REF="018003_0029_0FA50B59538281C0">
and payment of our immen&s;e debt to divine ju&s;tice. It is mo&s;t evident, from the pre&s;ent &s;tate of di&s;ea&s;ed guilty man, from the whole current of the bible, and from every con&s;titution of God; that all his pretences to ju&s;tification and life, by any thing of his own, are utterly vain; which mu&s;t not e&s;cape our notice, or fail of the &s;tricte&s;t attention.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ane is a very important matter to be ever in our view. Yea, a point as clear as any in all the bible, and abundantly con|firmed therein. It is ob&s;ervable, that early upon the fall of man, God declares again&s;t the vanity and folly of &s;ealing righteou&s;|ne&s;s by the deeds of the law, when once he had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed it. Accordingly he &s;oon lets Adam know he may not attempt now to approach the tree of life: but &s;o far from this, God drove him out of the garden; and &s;et cherubims, and a flaming &s;word which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. But oh! how &s;urpri&s;ing the divine benevolence, that even before Adam's exclu&s;ion from Paradi&s;e, and prohibition of u&s;ing the fir&s;t cove|nant, he opens a new and living way by the promi&s;e of the &s;eed of the woman to be the Saviour of men; the &s;ane that afterwards, is &s;tiled <HI>the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>VERY worthy of our remark it is, that God who is wont to &s;peak to us, e&s;pecially the mo&s;t important things by way of con|tra&s;t, &s;etting the one over again&s;t the other, that the light may appear the &s;tronger, and have the greater effect; and often &s;ets forth the gloomy part of the contra&s;t fir&s;t, though immediately after the encouraging part, as it were in the &s;ame breath. See the in&s;tance in Ho&s;es, xiii. 9. "O I&s;rael, (O man) thou ha&s;t de|&s;troyed thy&s;elf, but in me is thine help." So that in I&s;aiah, xxvii. 4, 5. "Who would &s;et the briers and thorns again&s;t me in the battle? I would go through them and burn them together Or let him take hold of my &s;trength and make peace with me,
<PB N="31" REF="018003_0030_0FA50B59DF0B3C30">
and he &s;hall make peace." I &s;ay it is worthy of remark, here in the ca&s;e of Adam; he exhibits the bright &s;ide of the contra&s;t fir&s;t: gives out the promi&s;e of a Saviour, before he fully opens upon the guilty creature the terrors of the broken law; as if he &s;hould be prevented from any di&s;pair, (only in him&s;elf) and have imme|diately ready at hand the mo&s;t powerful argument, to renounce &s;elf, and tru&s;t in an all-&s;ufficient Saviour. How thankful &s;hould we be for the provi&s;ion now made for our ju&s;tification and life, up|on a go&s;pel plan, that humbles men, and exalts the Lord.</P>
<P>I have fini&s;hed the whole, when I have added the appendix, u&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions; the account of <HI>bapti&s;ms</HI> and <HI>deaths,</HI> in this &s;ociety, with &s;ome proper reflections.</P>
<P>BAPTISMS this year, 40. Deaths, 36. Of the&s;e, infants, 5. Children from 2 years, with the youth to 25, are 10. From the age of 25 to 50, are 13. From 50 to 94, are 7. And al|&s;o died here in a few weeks, of the French pri&s;oners from New-York, 20. In all, 56.</P>
<P>I have thus cla&s;&s;ed out the dead, that you might have before you a &s;pecimen of demon&s;tration, that death &s;pares no age or character, but runs through all ages, from the infant of days, to the elde&s;t mortal: it &s;eizeth on per&s;ons of all characters, without di&s;tinction; &s;paring not the mo&s;t virtuous and u&s;eful, within its commi&s;&s;ion. Very &s;peaking it is, that no age or qualification, &s;ecureth from the irre&s;i&s;tible &s;troke. So that none may boa&s;t of a morrow; when death in its rapid way to the living, may come to day &s;uddenly, and un&s;u&s;pected as "a thief in the night."</P>
<P>AND now by this look into the grave, into the congregation of the dead, who number on in all periods of life, and continu|ally filling up that va&s;t collection in the &s;ilent abodes below: I &s;ay, by this view of what we are all ha&s;tening unto, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> to join
<PB N="32" REF="018003_0031_0FA50B5A9CD30B28">
the dead, every one in his own order and time. May we thro' grace, be very &s;olicitous to prepare each one for his own ap|proaching change; &s;o as that we may then attend with faith and fortitude to the <HI>&s;olemnities of dying,</HI> which &s;tand alone by them|&s;elves, and never repeated. Indeed the <HI>&s;olemnity of living</HI> with a ju&s;t reference to <HI>dying,</HI> is next to it and connected with it; and this to be carried on through life: but that of dying is but once and alone; and not a little determined what it is by the manner and kind of our life. Then let us not &s;pend our days as a tale that is told; &s;oon out, and to little purpo&s;e. But may we hear of every age, capable of reflecting on the importance of living and dying well; mo&s;t faithfully apply our&s;elves to our great work "while it is day, for the night cometh wherein no man can work."</P>
<P>IT is an old &s;aying and a true one, delays are dangerous; e&s;|pecially &s;o in the important matters of religion The King's bu&s;ine&s;s requires ho&s;te; the King of Kings will not have his po&s;t|poned, how expre&s;s his demand, that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">elay not to keep his com|mands.</HI> The rea&s;on is plain; delay is keeping God out of his due; is a kind of refu&s;al to pay it at all. 'Tis very injurious to our&s;elves, and threatens to be fatal. 'Tis certain our days ha&s;ten fa&s;t to a clo&s;e; and if our work doth not go on in &s;ome good pro|portion thereto, we &s;hall be &s;adly in the arrears of duty; and if the one thing needful is not done, what then but immer&s;ed in the irretrievable &s;tate of the &s;lothful? And now having &s;o many arguments to awaken our attention to our duty and intere&s;t, may we &s;ea&s;onably and thoroughly attend thereunto; let us &s;ee to it that our hearts are right with God; that we make with him an everla&s;ting covenant, and e&s;pecially learn to live the life of the righteous, and have our la&s;t end like his. Oh! let us under the realizing views of death's approach and &s;eizure, beyond any di&s;|charge in that war; be acting in the full character of the God|ly, and with right Chri&s;tian perceverance to the end. I con|clude with the prayer of Mo&s;es, "So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wi&s;dom," that by ha|ving through life, a ju&s;t and practical reference to death, and that final great account, we may commence <HI>the wi&s;e, that &s;hall inherit glory.</HI> AMEN.</P>
