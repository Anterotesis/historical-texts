<P>RESPECTING the &s;ource from which the following Letters have been drawn, and the grounds on which the reader is expected to re&s;t his belief of their authenticity, it may be &s;ufficient to inform him, that permi&s;&s;ion was obtained from the proper authority, to tran|&s;cribe, from the original papers pre&s;erved in the Secretary of State's office in Philadelphia, the&s;e and &s;undry other authentic documents relating to the conte&s;t between the colonies and the mother country, viz. Letters from the Commanders of the continental forces, and other per&s;ons employed in the public &s;ervice,&mdash;intercepted Letters from Briti&s;h Officers and other adherents to the royal cau&s;e,&mdash;Communications from the Gover|nors, Conventions, and Committees, of the &s;everal American States,&mdash;Di&s;patches from Agents and Commi&s;&s;ioners,&mdash;In&s;tructions,&mdash;Reports of Committees of Congre&s;s,&mdash;parts of the &s;ecret Journals hitherto unpubli&s;hed,&mdash;and various other pieces elucidative of the events which led to and finally e&s;tabli&s;hed American Independence.</P>
<P>That permi&s;&s;ion was granted early in the year 1792, and immediate advantage was
<PB N="iv" REF="029737_0003_0FE2463D94F232A8">
taken of the indulgence; though, from va|rious circum&s;tances, of little con&s;equence to the reader to know, the publication has been &s;o long delayed. Even at this late period, the editor contents him&s;elf with laying be|fore the public but a part of the collection,&mdash;intending, if the&s;e volumes meet with a fa|vourable reception, to continue the publica|tion, and pre&s;ent his readers with a variety of intere&s;ting pieces penned by the leaders and principal agents in the American Revolution, and tending to throw light on many import|ant tran&s;actions that have hitherto been ei|ther enveloped in total darkne&s;s, or, at be&s;t, but ob&s;curely perceived, and imperfectly un|der&s;tood.</P>
<P>Some parts of the&s;e letters may perhaps appear too full of minutiae to intere&s;t that cla&s;s of readers, who, unaccu&s;tomed to enter into the inve&s;tigation of cau&s;es or con&s;e|quences, delight only in recitals of battles, &s;ieges, and other &s;triking occurrences which con&s;titute the more prominent features of hi&s;tory. But, to the rea&s;oning philo&s;ophic reader, who wi&s;hes to explore the &s;ecret &s;prings of action,&mdash;to trace events to their remote and latent cau&s;es,&mdash;to di&s;cover and examine the &s;ubordinate and collateral cir|cum&s;tances (oft trifling in appearance, and generally overlooked by the vulgar eye) which, in the &s;truggles of contending na|tions give a preponderancy to the one or the other &s;cale,&mdash;tho&s;e minute details will, it
<PB N="v" REF="029737_0004_0FE2463F179F16B0">
is pre&s;umed, be far from unacceptable, as furni&s;hing him with that &s;pecies of informa|tion, upon which alone he can venture to ground a deci&s;ive opinion, and which he might el&s;ewhere &s;eek in vain.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ures, frequently referred to in the&s;e volumes, would &s;till further contribute to &s;et every circum&s;tance in a clearer and &s;tronger light; and it was the editor's origi|nal intention that they &s;hould have accompa|nied the letters to which they re&s;pectively belong. Ob&s;tacles however, <HI>at pre&s;ent</HI> in&s;ur|mountable, &s;tand in the way of their imme|diate publication: but, when the&s;e are re|moved, the papers alluded to &s;hall make their appearance in form of an Appendix,&mdash;&s;uch parts of them at lea&s;t, as are of a curious and intere&s;ting nature.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the reader will ob&s;erve, that it was deemed as yet premature to publi&s;h cer|tain pa&s;&s;ages of the&s;e letters: &s;ome omi&s;&s;ions have of cour&s;e taken place, which are every where pointed out by a&s;teri&s;ks, and which will be &s;upplied at a proper &s;ea&s;on, probably not far di&s;tant. On the other hand, in per|haps half a dozen in&s;tances, a &s;ingle word has been hazarded on conjecture, to fill up a cha&s;m, where either the original or the copy happened to be torn or defaced; in which ca&s;es, the &s;upplemental words are inclo&s;ed within crotchets and printed in Italic. A few entire letters, moreover, as appears by refer|ence made to them in &s;ub&s;equent ones, are
<PB N="vi" REF="029737_0005_0FE24641B1B046A0">
here wanted to complete the chain of cor|re&s;pondence. The&s;e the editor can give no account of, as the originals appear to have been lo&s;t from the files of office.</P>
<P>About a dozen letters, written by the gen|eral's &s;ecretary,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. P. H. Harri&s;on.</NOTE> are here in&s;erted;&mdash;a few from the general him&s;elf to the board of war, or committee of Congre&s;s,&mdash;one to the pre&s;|ident of the New-York Convention, and one to R. Morris, E&s;quire, in the department of finance. The&s;e it was thought improper to omit: nor did it &s;eem worth while, on ac|count of a few exceptions, to make any al|teration in the general title of the book.</P>

<P>THE rain on Friday afternoon and Saturday,&mdash;the ad|vice of &s;everal gentlemen of the Jer&s;eys and this city, by no means to cro&s;s Hud&s;on's river at the lower ferry&mdash;and &s;ome other circum&s;tances, too trivial to mention, pre|vented my arrival at this place, until the afternoon of this day.</P>
<P>In the morning, after giving general Schuyler &s;uch or|ders, as, from the re&s;ult of my inquiry into matters here, appear nece&s;&s;ary, I &s;hall &s;et out on my journey to the camp at Bo&s;ton, and &s;hall proceed with all the di&s;patch in my power. Powder is &s;o e&s;&s;ential an article, that I can|not help again repeating the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;upply. The camp at Bo&s;ton, from the be&s;t account I can get from thence, is but very poorly &s;upplied. At this place, they have &s;carce any. How they are provided at general Woo&s;ter's camp, I have not been able yet to learn.</P>
<P>Governor Tryon is arrived, and general Schuyler di|rected to advi&s;e you of the line of conduct he moves in. I fear it will not be very favourable to the American cau&s;e.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UPON my arrival here this afternoon, I was inform|ed that an express's was in town, from the provincial camp in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay; and having &s;een, among the pa|pers in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, a letter directed to you as Pre&s;ident of the Congre&s;s, I have taken the liberty to open it. I was induced to take that liberty, by &s;everal gentlemen of New-York who were anxious to know the particulars of the affair of the &s;eventeenth in&s;tant, and agreeable to the orders of many members of the Congre&s;s, who judged it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould avail my&s;elf of the be&s;t information in the cour&s;e of my journey.</P>
<P>You will find, Sir, by that letter, a great want of pow|der in the provincial army, which I &s;incerely hope the Congre&s;s will &s;upply as &s;peedily and as effectually as in their power. One thou&s;and pounds in weight were &s;ent to the camp at Cambridge, three days ago, from this city; which has left this place almo&s;t de&s;titute of that nece&s;&s;ary article; there being at this time, from the be&s;t informa|tion, not more than four barrels of powder in the city of New-York.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e to &s;et off for the provincial camp to-morrow, and will u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch to join the forces there.</P>
<P>Plea&s;e to make my compliments to the gentlemen of the Congre&s;s; and believe me to be, Sir, your obliged friend, and humble &s;ervant,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ARRIVED &s;afe at this place on the third in&s;tant, after a journey attended with a good deal of fatigue, and retarded by nece&s;&s;ary attentions to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive civilities which accompanied me in my whole route.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="029737_0008_0FE2464AEB01BC30">
Upon my arrival, I immediately vi&s;ited the &s;everal po&s;ts occupied by our troops; and, as &s;oon as the weather per|mitted, reconnoitred tho&s;e of the enemy. I found the lat|ter &s;trongly intrenched on Bunker's-hill, about a mile from Charle&s;town, and advanced about half a mile from the place of the late action, with their centries extended about one hundred and fifty yards on this &s;ide of the narrowe&s;t part of the neck leading from this place to Charle&s;town. Three floating batteries lie in My&s;tick river near their camp, and one twenty-gun &s;hip below the ferry place between Bo&s;ton and Charle&s;town. They have al&s;o a battery on Cop&s;e-hill, on the Bo&s;ton &s;ide, which much annoyed our troops in the late attack. Upon the neck, they have al&s;o deeply in|trenched and fortified. Their advanced guards, till la&s;t Saturday morning, occupied Brown's hou&s;es, about a mile from Roxbury meeting-hou&s;e, and twenty roods from their lines: but, at that time, a party from general Thomas's camp &s;urpri&s;ed the guard, drove them in, and burned the hou&s;es. The bulk of their army, commanded by general Howe, lies on Bunker's-hill, and the remainder on Rox|bury-neck, except the light hor&s;e, and a few men in the town of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>On our &s;ide, we have thrown up intrenchments on Win|ter and Pro&s;pect hills,&mdash;the enemy's camp in full view, at the di&s;tance of little more than a mile. Such intermediate points as would admit a landing, I have &s;ince my arrival taken care to &s;trengthen, down to Sewal's Farm, where a &s;trong intrenchment has been thrown up. At Roxbury, general Thomas has thrown up a &s;trong work on the hill, about two hundred yards above the meeting-hou&s;e; which, with the brokenne&s;s of the ground, and a great number of rocks, has made that pa&s;s very &s;ecure. The troops rai&s;ed in New-Hamp&s;hire, with a regiment from Rhode-I&s;land, occupy Winter-hill: a part of tho&s;e from Connecticut, un|der general Putnam, are on Pro&s;pect-hill. The troops in this town are entirely of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts: the remainder of the Rhode-I&s;land men are at Sewal's Farm. Two reg|iments of Connecticut, and nine of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, are at Roxbury. The re&s;idue of the army, to the number of about &s;even hundred, are po&s;ted in &s;everal &s;mall towns along the coa&s;t, to prevent the depredations of the enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="029737_0009_0FE2464D890EB1F0">
Upon the whole, I think my&s;elf authori&s;ed to &s;ay, that, con&s;idering the great extent of line and the nature of the ground, we are as well &s;ecured, as could be expected in &s;o &s;hort a time, and under the di&s;advantages we labour. The&s;e con&s;i&s;t in a want of engineers to con&s;truct proper works and direct the men, a want of tools, and a &s;ufficient number of men to man the works in ca&s;e of an attack. You will ob&s;erve, by the proceedings of the council of war which I have the honour to inclo&s;e, that it is our unanimous opin|ion, to hold and defend the&s;e works as long as po&s;&s;ible. The di&s;couragement it would give the men, and its con|trary effects on the mini&s;terial troops, thus to abandon our encampment in their face, formed with &s;o much labour,&mdash;added to the certain de&s;truction of a con&s;iderable and valu|able extent of country, and our uncertainty of finding a place in all re&s;pects &s;o capable of making a &s;tand,&mdash;are leading rea&s;ons for this determination. At the &s;ame time we are very &s;en&s;ible of the difficulties which attend the defence of lines of &s;o great extent, and the dangers which may en&s;ue from &s;uch a divi&s;ion of the army.</P>
<P>My earne&s;t wi&s;h to comply with the in&s;tructions of the Congre&s;s, in making an early and complete return of the &s;tate of the army, has led into an involuntary delay of ad|dre&s;&s;ing you; which has given me much concern. Hav|ing given orders for this purpo&s;e immediately on my arriv|al,&mdash;and unappri&s;ed of the imperfect obedience which had been paid to tho&s;e of the like nature from general Ward, I was led from day to day to expect they would come in, and therefore detained the me&s;&s;enger. They are not now &s;o complete as I could wi&s;h: but much allowance is to be made for inexperience in forms, and a liberty which had been taken (not given) on this &s;ubject. The&s;e rea|&s;ons I flatter my&s;elf, will no longer exi&s;t; and, of con&s;e|quence, more regularity and exactne&s;s will in future pre|vail. This, with a nece&s;&s;ary attention to the lines, the movements of the mini&s;terial troops, and our immediate &s;ecurity, mu&s;t be my apology, which I beg you to lay be|fore Congre&s;s with the utmo&s;t duty and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>We labour under great di&s;advantages for want of tents: for, though they have been helped out by a collection of now u&s;ele&s;s &s;ails from the &s;ea-port towns, the number is far
<PB N="11" REF="029737_0010_0FE24653E9BB1B00">
&s;hort of our nece&s;&s;ities. The colleges and hou&s;es of this town are nece&s;&s;arily occupied by the troops; which affords another rea&s;on for keeping our pre&s;ent &s;ituation. But I mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h the whole army was properly provided to take the field, as I am well a&s;&s;ured, that (be&s;ides greater expedition and activity in ca&s;e of alarm) it would highly conduce to health and di&s;cipline. As materials are not to be had here, I would beg leave to recommend the pro|curing a farther &s;upply from Philadelphia, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be extremely deficient in gratitude as well as ju&s;|tice, if I did not take the fir&s;t opportunity to acknowledge the readine&s;s and attention, which the provincial Congre&s;s and different committees have &s;hewn, to make every thing as convenient and agreeable as po&s;&s;ible. But there is a vital and inherent principle of delay, incompatible with military &s;ervice, in tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s through &s;uch numerous and different channels. I e&s;teem it therefore my duty to repre|&s;ent the inconvenience which mu&s;t unavoidably en&s;ue from a dependence on a number of per&s;ons for &s;upplies; and &s;ub|mit it to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, whether the pub|lic &s;ervice will not be be&s;t promoted by appointing a com|mi&s;&s;ary-general for the&s;e purpo&s;es. We have a &s;triking in&s;tance of the preference of &s;uch a mode, in the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of Connecticut, as their troops are extremely well provided under the direction of Mr. Trumbull, and he has at different times a&s;&s;i&s;ted others with various articles. Should my &s;entiments happily coincide with tho&s;e of your honours on this &s;ubject, I beg leave to recommend Mr. Trumbull as a very proper per&s;on for this department. In the arrangement of troops collected under &s;uch circum|&s;tances, and upon the &s;pur of immediate nece&s;&s;ity, &s;everal appointments are omitted, which appear to be indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for the good government of the army&mdash;particu|larly a quarter-ma&s;ter-general, a commi&s;&s;ary of mu&s;ters, and a commi&s;&s;ary of artillery. The&s;e I mu&s;t earne&s;tly recom|mend to the notice and provi&s;ion of the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>I find my&s;elf already much embarra&s;&s;ed, for want of a military che&s;t. The&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments will increa&s;e every day: I mu&s;t therefore reque&s;t that money may be forward|ed as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. The want of this mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary arti|cle will (I fear) produce great inconveniences, if not pre|vented
<PB N="12" REF="029737_0011_0FE24656D3586C50">
by an early attention. I find the army in general, and the troops rai&s;ed in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts in particular, very deficient in nece&s;&s;ary clothing. Upon inquiry, there ap|pears no probability of obtaining any &s;upplies in this quar|ter: and, on the be&s;t con&s;ideration of this matter I am able to form, I am of opinion that a number of hunting &s;hirts (not le&s;s than ten thou&s;and) would in a great degree re|move this difficulty, in the cheape&s;t and quicke&s;t manner. I know nothing, in a &s;peculative view, more trivial, yet, if put in practice, would have a happier tendency to unite the men, and aboli&s;h tho&s;e provincial di&s;tinctions which lead to jealou&s;y and di&s;&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>In a former part of this letter, I mentioned the want of engineers. I can hardly expre&s;s the di&s;appointment I have experienced on this &s;ubject,&mdash;the &s;kill of tho&s;e we have being very imperfect, and confined to the mere man|ual exerci&s;e of cannon; whereas the war in which we are engaged requires a knowledge, comprehending the duties of the field, and fortification. If any per&s;ons thus qual|ified are to be found in the &s;outhern colonies, it would be of great public &s;ervice to forward them with all expe|dition.</P>
<P>Upon the article of ammunition, I mu&s;t re-echo the former complaints on this &s;ubject. We are &s;o exceeding|ly de&s;titute, that our artillery will be of little u&s;e, without a &s;upply both large and &s;ea&s;onable. What we have mu&s;t be re&s;erved for the &s;mall arms, and that managed with the utmo&s;t frugality.* * *</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the army you will find a&s;certained with tolerable preci&s;ion in the returns which accompany this letter. Upon finding the number of men to fall &s;o far &s;hort of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, and below all expectation, I imme|diately called a council of the general officers, who&s;e opinion (as to the mode of filling up the regiments, and providing for the pre&s;ent exigency) I have the honour of inclo&s;ing, together with the be&s;t judgment we are able to form of the mini&s;terial troops. From the number of boys, de&s;erters, and negroes, that have been enli&s;ted in the troops of this province, I entertain &s;ome doubts wheth|er the number required can be rai&s;ed here: and all the gen|eral officers agree that no dependence can be put on the
<PB N="13" REF="029737_0012_0FE246585766DC28">
militia, for a continuance in camp, or regularity and di&s;|cipline during the &s;hort time they may &s;tay. This unhap|py and devoted province has been &s;o long in a &s;tate of anarchy, and the yoke * * * * * been laid &s;o heavily on it, that great allowances are to be made for troops rai&s;ed under &s;uch circum&s;tances. The deficiency of numbers, di&s;cipline, and &s;tores, can only lead to this conclu&s;ion, that their &s;pirit has exceeded their &s;trength. But at the &s;ame time I would humbly &s;ubmit to the con&s;id|eration of Congre&s;s the propriety of making &s;ome further provi&s;ion of men from the other colonies. If the&s;e regi|ments &s;hould be completed to their e&s;tabli&s;hment, the di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e unfit for duty on account of their age and character would occa&s;ion a con&s;iderable reduction; and, at all events, they have been enli&s;ted upon &s;uch terms, that they may be di&s;banded when other troops arrive. But &s;hould my apprehen&s;ions be realized, and the regiments here be not filled up, the public cau&s;e would &s;uffer by an ab|&s;olute dependence upon &s;o doubtful an event, unle&s;s &s;ome provi&s;ion is made again&s;t &s;uch a di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>It requires no military &s;kill, to judge of the difficulty of introducing proper di&s;cipline and &s;ubordination into an ar|my while we have the enemy in view, and are in daily ex|pectation of an attack: but it is of &s;o much importance, that every effort will be made, which time and circum|&s;tances will admit. In the mean time I have a &s;incere plea&s;ure in ob&s;erving that there are materials for a good army&mdash;a great number of able-bodied men, active, zealous in the cau&s;e, and of unque&s;tionable courage.</P>
<P>I am now, Sir, to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the twenty-eighth, inclo&s;ing the re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s, of the twenty-&s;eventh ultimo, and a copy of a letter from the committee of Albany; to all which I &s;hall pay due attention.</P>
<P>Generals Gates and Sullivan have both arrived in good health.</P>
<P>My be&s;t abilities are at all times devoted to the &s;ervice of my country: but I feel the weight, importance, and variety of my pre&s;ent duties too &s;en&s;ibly, not to wi&s;h a more immediate and frequent communication with the Congre&s;s. I fear it may often happen in the cour&s;e of our
<PB N="14" REF="029737_0013_0FE24659DB70C7C0">
pre&s;ent operations, that I &s;hall need that a&s;&s;i&s;tance and direction from them, which time and di&s;tance will not al|low me to receive.</P>

<P>P. S. Having ordered the commanding officer to give me the earlie&s;t intelligence of every motion of the enemy by land or water, di&s;cernible from the heights of his camp, I this in&s;tant, as I was clo&s;ing my letter, received the in|clo&s;ed from the brigade major. The de&s;ign of this ma|noeuvre I know not:&mdash;perhaps it may be to make a de|&s;cent &s;omewhere along the coa&s;t:&mdash;it may be for New-York; or it may be practi&s;ed as a deception on us. I thought it not improper however to mention the matter to you: I have done the &s;ame to the commanding officer at New-York; and I &s;hall let it be known to the committee of &s;afety here, &s;o that intelligence may be communicated, as they &s;hall think be&s;t, along the &s;ea-coa&s;t of this gov|ernment.</P>

<P>SINCE I did my&s;elf the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the tenth in&s;tant, nothing material has happened in the camp. From &s;ome authentic and late advices of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the mini&s;terial troops, and the great inconvenience of calling in the militia in the mid&s;t of harve&s;t, I have been induced for the pre&s;ent to wave it:&mdash;but in the mean time recruiting parties have been &s;ent throughout this province,
<PB N="15" REF="029737_0014_0FE24664CE3901A8">
to fill up the regiments to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the provin|cial Congre&s;s. At the &s;ame time that I received the&s;e ad|vices, I al&s;o obtained a li&s;t of the officers of the enemy killed and wounded in the late battle at Charle&s;town, which I take this opportunity to inclo&s;e.</P>
<P>The great &s;carcity of fre&s;h provi&s;ions in their army has led me to take every precaution to prevent a &s;upply: for this purpo&s;e, I have ordered all the cattle and &s;heep to be drawn from the low grounds and farms within their reach. A detachment from general Thomas's camp, on Wedne&s;|day night, went over to Long-I&s;land, and brought from thence twenty cattle and a number of &s;heep, with about fifteen labourers who had been put on by a Mr. Ray Thomas, to cut the hay, &amp;c. By &s;ome accident, they omitted burning the hay, and returned the next day at noon to complete it; which they effected, amid&s;t the firing of the &s;hipping, with the lo&s;s of one man killed and anoth|er wounded.</P>
<P>La&s;t evening al&s;o a party of the Connecticut-men &s;troll|ed down on the mar&s;h at Roxbury, and fired upon a cen|try; which drew on a heavy fire from the enemy's lines and floating batteries, but attended with no other effect than the lo&s;s of one killed by a &s;hot from the enemy's lines. In the mean time, we are, on both &s;ides, contin|uing our works: but there has been no other movement than what I have noticed above. I &s;hall endeavour to give a regular and particular account of all tran&s;actions as they occur, which you will plea&s;e to lay before the honourable Congre&s;s. I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I did my&s;elf the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you the fourteenth in&s;tant, I have received advice from gov|ernor Trumbull, that the a&s;&s;embly of Connecticut had vot|ed, and that they are now rai&s;ing, two regiments of &s;even hundred men each, in con&s;equence of an application from the provincial Congre&s;s of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay. The Rhode-I&s;land a&s;&s;embly has al&s;o made an augmentation for
<PB N="16" REF="029737_0015_0FE24666A5B06C18">
this purpo&s;e. The&s;e reinforcements, with the riflemen who are daily expected, and &s;uch recruits as may come in to fill up the regiments here, will, I apprehend, compo&s;e an army &s;ufficiently &s;trong to oppo&s;e any force which may be brought again&s;t us at pre&s;ent. I am very &s;en&s;ible that the heavy expen&s;e, nece&s;&s;arily attendant upon this cam|paign, will call for the utmo&s;t frugality and care, and would therefore, if po&s;&s;ible, avoid enli&s;ting one unnece&s;&s;ary man. As this is the fir&s;t certain account of the de&s;tina|tion of the&s;e new-rai&s;ed troops, I thought proper to com|municate my &s;entiments as early as po&s;&s;ible, le&s;t the Con|gre&s;s &s;hould act upon my letter of the tenth, and rai&s;e troops in the &s;outhern colonies, which, in my pre&s;ent judg|ment, may be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>For the&s;e eight days pa&s;t, there have been no move|ments in either camp, of any con&s;equence. On our &s;ide, we have continued the works without any intermi&s;&s;ion; and they are now &s;o far advanced as to leave us little to apprehend on that &s;core. On the &s;ide of the enemy, they have al&s;o been very indu&s;trious in fini&s;hing their lines, both on Bunker's-hill and Roxbury-neck. In this inter|val al&s;o, their tran&s;ports have arrived from New-York; and they have been employed in landing and &s;tationing their men. I have been able to collect no certain account of the numbers arrived: but the inclo&s;ed letter, wrote (though not &s;igned) by Mr. Sheriff Lee, and delivered me by captain Darby, (who went expre&s;s with an account of the Lexington battle) will enable us to form a pretty accurate judgment. The increa&s;e of tents and men in the town of Bo&s;ton is very obvious; but all my accounts from thence agree that there is a great mortality, occa&s;ioned by the want of vegetables and fre&s;h meat; and that their lo&s;s in the late battle at Charle&s;town (from the few recoveries of their wounded) is greater than at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed. The condition of the inhabitants detained in Bo&s;ton is very di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing: they are equally de&s;titute of the comfort of fre&s;h provi&s;ions; and many of them are &s;o reduced in their cir|cum&s;tances, as to be unable to &s;upply them&s;elves with &s;alt. Such fi&s;h as the &s;oldiery leave is their principal &s;upport. Added to all this, &s;uch &s;u&s;picion and jealou&s;y prevails, that
<PB N="17" REF="029737_0016_0FE2466829A8F290">
they can &s;carcely &s;peak, or even look, without expo&s;ing them&s;elves to &s;ome &s;pecies of military execution.</P>
<P>I have not been able, from any intelligence I have re|ceived, to form any certain judgment of the future opera|tions of the enemy. Sometimes I have &s;u&s;pected an in|tention of detaching a part of their army to &s;ome part of the coa&s;t, as they have been building a number of flat-bot|tomed boats, capable of holding two hundred men each. But, from their works, and the language held at Bo&s;ton, there is rea&s;on to think they expect the attack from us, and are principally engaged in preparing them&s;elves again&s;t it. I have ordered all the whale-boats along the coa&s;t to be collected: and &s;ome of them are employed every night to watch the motions of the enemy by water, &s;o as to guard as much as po&s;&s;ible again&s;t any &s;urpri&s;e. * * *</P>
<P>Next to the more immediate and pre&s;&s;ing duties of put|ting our lines in as &s;ecure a &s;tate as po&s;&s;ible, attending to the movements of the enemy, and gaining intelligence,&mdash;my great concern is to e&s;tabli&s;h order, regularity and di&s;|cipline, without which our numbers would embarra&s;s us, and, in ca&s;e of action, general confu&s;ion mu&s;t infallibly en|&s;ue. In order to this, I propo&s;e to divide the army into three divi&s;ions:&mdash;at the head of each will be a general officer:&mdash;the&s;e divi&s;ions to be again &s;ubdivided into brig|ades, under their re&s;pective brigadiers. But the difficul|ty ari&s;ing from the arrangement of the general officers, and waiting the farther proceedings of the Congre&s;s on this &s;ubject, has much retarded my progre&s;s in this mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary work. I &s;hould be very happy to receive their final commands, as any determination would enable me to proceed in my plan. * * *</P>
<P>In addition to the officers mentioned in mine of the tenth in&s;tant, I would humbly propo&s;e that &s;ome provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for a judge-advocate, and provo&s;t-mar&s;hal. The nece&s;&s;ity of the fir&s;t appointment was &s;o great, that I was obliged to nominate a Mr. Tudor, who was well recommended to me, and now executes the office under an expectation of receiving captain's pay&mdash;an allowance (in my opinion) &s;carcely adequate to the &s;ervice, in new-rai&s;ed troops, where there are court-martials every day. However, as that is the proportion in the regular army,
<PB N="18" REF="029737_0017_0FE24669AC62BB60">
and he is contented, there will be no nece&s;&s;ity of an ad|dition.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o renew my reque&s;t as to money, and the ap|pointment of a pay-ma&s;ter. I have forbore urging mat|ters of this nature, from my knowledge of the many im|portant concerns which engage the attention of the Con|gre&s;s: but as I find my difficulties thicken every day, I make no doubt, &s;uitable regard will be paid to a nece&s;&s;ity of this kind. The inconvenience of borrowing &s;uch &s;ums as are con&s;tantly requi&s;ite mu&s;t be too plain for me to en|large upon, and is a &s;ituation from which I &s;hould be very happy to be relieved.</P>
<P>Upon the experience I have had, and the be&s;t con&s;id|eration of the appointment of the &s;everal offices of com|mi&s;&s;ary-general, mu&s;ter-ma&s;ter-general, quarter-ma&s;ter-gen|eral, pay-ma&s;ter-general, and commi&s;&s;ary of artillery, I am clearly of opinion that they not only conduce to or|der, di&s;patch and di&s;cipline, but that it is a mea&s;ure of economy. The delay, the wa&s;te, and unpuni&s;hable neglect of duty, ari&s;ing from the&s;e offices being in commi&s;&s;ion in &s;everal hands, evidently &s;hew that the public expen&s;e mu&s;t be finally enhanced. I have experienced the want of the&s;e officers, in completing the returns of men, ammunition, and &s;tores. The latter are yet imperfect, from the number of hands in which they are di&s;per&s;ed. I have inclo&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> la&s;t weekly return, which is more accurate than the former; and hope in a little time we &s;hall be perfectly regular in this as well as &s;everal other nece&s;&s;ary branches of duty.</P>
<P>I have made inquiry into the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the ho&s;|pital, and find it in a very un&s;ettled condition. There is no principal director, nor any &s;ubordination among the &s;ur|geons: of con&s;equence, di&s;putes and contention have ari&s;en, and mu&s;t continue until it is reduced to &s;ome &s;y&s;tem. I could wi&s;h it was immediately taken into con&s;ideration, as the lives and health of both officers and men &s;o much de|pend upon a due regulation of this department. I have been particularly attentive to the lea&s;t &s;ymptoms of the &s;mall pox; and hitherto we have been &s;o fortunate as to have every per&s;on removed &s;o &s;oon, as not only to prevent any communication, but any alarm or apprehen&s;ion it might
<PB N="19" REF="029737_0018_0FE24672A1AE6020">
give in the camp. We &s;hall continue the utmo&s;t vigilance again&s;t this mo&s;t dangerous enemy.</P>
<P>In an army properly organized, there are &s;undry offices of an inferior kind, &s;uch as waggon-ma&s;ter, ma&s;ter-carpen|ter, &amp;c. but I doubt whether my powers are &s;ufficiently exten&s;ive for &s;uch appointments. If it is thought prop|er to repo&s;e &s;uch a tru&s;t in me, I &s;hall be governed, in the di&s;charge of it, by a &s;trict regard to economy and the public intere&s;t.</P>
<P>My in&s;tructions from the honourable Congre&s;s direct that no troops are to be di&s;banded without their expre&s;s direction, nor to be recruited to more than double the num|ber of the enemy. Upon this &s;ubject I beg leave to rep|re&s;ent, that, unle&s;s the regiments in this province are more &s;ucce&s;sful in recruiting than I have rea&s;on to expect, a re|duction of &s;ome of them will be highly nece&s;&s;ary, as the public is put to the whole expen&s;e of an e&s;tabli&s;hment of officers, while the real &s;trength of the regiment (which con&s;i&s;ts in the rank and file) is defective. In ca&s;e of &s;uch a reduction, doubtle&s;s &s;ome of the privates and all the officers would return home: but many of the former would go into the remaining regiments; and having had &s;ome ex|perience, would fill them up with u&s;eful men. I &s;o plainly perceive the expen&s;e of this campaign will exceed any cal|culation hitherto made, that I am particularly anxious to &s;trike off every unnece&s;&s;ary charge. You will therefore, Sir, be plea&s;ed to favour me with explicit directions from the Congre&s;s, on the mode of this reduction (if it &s;hall ap|pear nece&s;&s;ary) that no time may be lo&s;t when &s;uch nece&s;|&s;ity appears.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday we had an account that the light-hou&s;e was on fire:&mdash;by whom, and under what orders, I have not yet learned: but we have rea&s;on to believe it has been done by our irregulars.</P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to pre&s;ent me to the Congre&s;s, with the utmo&s;t duty and re&s;pect; and believe me to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>NOTHING material has occurred in either camp, &s;ince I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you on the twenty-fir&s;t in&s;tant by expre&s;s: but on Tue&s;day, three men-of-war and nine tran&s;ports &s;ailed out of Bo&s;ton harbour, and &s;tood a cour&s;e about E. S. E.</P>
<P>One Groves, who came out of Bo&s;ton the &s;ame evening, informed the officer at one of the out-po&s;ts, that the tran&s;|ports had on board &s;ix hundred men, and were bound to Block-I&s;land, Fi&s;her's-I&s;land, and Long-I&s;land, to plunder them, and bring off what cattle they may find. The fellow returned again into Bo&s;ton under &s;uch &s;u&s;picious circum|&s;tances, that it has led me to doubt the truth of his intel|ligence.</P>
<P>A de&s;erter, who came in afterwards, informs me that it was given out in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">amp, that they were either gone for Indians or fre&s;h provi&s;ions; and that each tran&s;port had but twenty men on board. Upon this intelligence, I im|mediately wrote to governor Cooke of Rhode-I&s;land, and
<PB N="21" REF="029737_0020_0FE24675AE57C500">
to general Woo&s;ter, that they might take proper precau|tions for removing the cattle off tho&s;e i&s;lands and the coa&s;ts, and to prevent any &s;urpri&s;e. As we are confirmed, by every account, in the &s;carcity of fre&s;h provi&s;ions in the ene|my's camp, and particularly by this de&s;erter, it is very prob|able this voyage may be only intended for a &s;upply: but as it may po&s;&s;ibly be otherwi&s;e, I thought it be&s;t to tran&s;mit the intelligence to the honourable Congre&s;s, that they may forward it to the &s;outhward, or take &s;uch other &s;teps as they may judge proper.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, three more de&s;erters have come out,&mdash;which makes four in twenty-four hours. Their ac|counts corre&s;pond with tho&s;e of the fir&s;t who came out, and which I have related above. I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the twenty-fourth July, accompanied by two hundred and eighty-four commi&s;&s;ions, which are yet much &s;hort of the nece&s;&s;ary number. I am much honoured by the confidence repo&s;ed in me, of appointing the &s;everal officers recom|mended in mine of the tenth ultimo; and &s;hall endeavour to &s;elect &s;uch per&s;ons as are be&s;t qualified to fill the&s;e import|ant po&s;ts. * * * *</P>
<P>In the renewal of the&s;e commi&s;&s;ions, &s;ome difficulties occur, in which I &s;hould be glad to know the plea&s;ure of the honourable Congre&s;s. The general officers of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts have regiments; tho&s;e of Connecticut have both regiments and companies; and the other field officers have companies each. From Rhode-I&s;land, the general officer has no regiment, but the field officers have com|panies: but I do not find that they have or expect pay under more than one commi&s;&s;ion. Should the com|mi&s;&s;ions, now to be delivered, pur&s;ue the&s;e different e&s;tabli&s;hments, there will be a di&s;tinction between general and field officers of the &s;ame rank. In order to put New-Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and Rhode-I&s;land, upon a line with Connecticut, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;mi&s;s a num|ber
<PB N="22" REF="029737_0021_0FE2467733837448">
of officers, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of commi&s;&s;ions, without any fault of theirs. On the other hand, to bring the Connec|ticut generals and field officers to the &s;ame &s;cale with the others, will add to the number of officers, and may be deem|ed incon&s;i&s;tent with the terms on which they entered into the &s;ervice, although you add nothing to the expen&s;e, ex|cept in the article of provi&s;ions. Upon the whole, it is a ca&s;e which I would wi&s;h the honourable Congre&s;s to con|&s;ider and determine.</P>
<P>Colonel Gridley of this province, who is at the head of the artillery, has the rank of major-general from the pro|vincial Congre&s;s. Will it be proper to renew his commi&s;|&s;ion here in the &s;ame manner?&mdash;It is proper here to re|mark, that, in this ca&s;e, he will take rank of all the briga|diers-general, and even the majors-general, who&s;e commi&s;|&s;ions are &s;ub&s;equent in date: and this can an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e, but may be productive of many bad con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The&s;e are matters of &s;ome importance: but I am em|barra&s;&s;ed with a difficulty of a &s;uperior kind. The e&s;ti|mate, made in Congre&s;s, &s;uppo&s;ed all the regiments to be formed upon one e&s;tabli&s;hment: but they are different in different provinces, and even vary in the &s;ame province, in &s;ome particulars. In Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, &s;ome regiments have ten companies, others eleven: the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the former is five hundred and ninety men, officers included; of the latter, &s;ix hundred and forty-nine. The e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of Rhode-I&s;land and New-Hamp&s;hire is five hundred and ninety to a regiment, officers included:&mdash;Connecticut has a thou&s;and men to a regiment. Should the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts regiments be completed, with the new levies from Rhode-I&s;land and Connecticut, and the riflemen, the num|ber will exceed twenty-two thou&s;and. If they &s;hould not be completed,&mdash;as each regiment is fully officered, there will be a heavy expen&s;e to the public, without an adequate &s;ervice. The reduction of &s;ome of them &s;eems to be nec|e&s;&s;ary, and yet is a matter of much delicacy, as we are &s;ituated. I mo&s;t earne&s;tly reque&s;t it may be taken into immediate con&s;ideration, and the time and mode of doing it pointed out by the honourable Congre&s;s. By an e&s;ti|mate I have made from the general return,&mdash;when the new levies arrive, and the regiments are completed, there will
<PB N="23" REF="029737_0022_0FE246806AD600E0">
be twenty-four thou&s;and four hundred and fifty men on the pay and provi&s;ion of the United Colonies. Some of the recruiting officers, who have been out on that &s;ervice, have returned with very little &s;ucce&s;s; &s;o that we may &s;afely con|clude, the number of two thou&s;and and &s;ixty-four, now wanting to complete, will rather increa&s;e than dimini&s;h. There are the regiment of artillery, con&s;i&s;ting of four hun|dred and ninety-three men, and one under colonel Ser|geant (who has not received any commi&s;&s;ion, although he had orders to rai&s;e a regiment, from the provincial Congre&s;s here) which are not included in the above e&s;timate. This la&s;t regiment con&s;i&s;ts of two hundred and thirty-four men by the la&s;t return; but a company has &s;ince joined.</P>
<P>By adverting to the general return, which I have the honour of inclo&s;ing (N^o 1) it will be &s;een what regiments are mo&s;t deficient.</P>
<P>If the Congre&s;s does not choo&s;e to point out the particu|lar regiments, but the provinces in which the reduction is to be made, the &s;everal Congre&s;&s;es and A&s;&s;emblies may be the proper channel to conduct this bu&s;ine&s;s, which I would al&s;o conceive the mo&s;t advi&s;able, from their better acquaint|ance with the merits, terms, and time of &s;ervice, of the re&s;pective officers. Reducing &s;ome regiments, and, with the privates thereof, filling up others, would certainly be the be&s;t method of accompli&s;hing this work if it were prac|ticable: but the experiment is dangerous, as the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts-men, under the privilege of choo&s;ing their own offi|cers, do not conceive them&s;elves bound, if tho&s;e officers are di&s;banded.</P>
<P>As general Gage is making preparations for winter by contracting for quantities of coal, it will &s;ugge&s;t to us the propriety of extending our views to that &s;ea&s;on. I have directed that &s;uch huts as have been lately made of boards &s;hould be done in &s;uch a manner, that, if nece&s;&s;ary, they may &s;erve for covering during the winter. But I need not enlarge upon the variety of nece&s;&s;ities, &s;uch as cloth|ing, fuel, &amp;c. (both exceedingly &s;carce, and difficult to be procured) which that &s;ea&s;on mu&s;t bring with it, if the ar|my or any con&s;iderable part of it is to remain embodied.</P>
<P>From the inactivity of the enemy &s;ince the arrival of their whole reinforcement, their continual addition to their
<PB N="24" REF="029737_0023_0FE24682295AAB80">
lines,&mdash;and many other circum&s;tances,&mdash;I am inclined to think, that, finding us &s;o well prepared to receive them, the plan of operations is varied, and they mean, by regular approaches, to bombard us out of our pre&s;ent line of defence, or are waiting in expectation that the colonies mu&s;t &s;ink under the weight of the expen&s;e, or the pro&s;pect of a winter campaign &s;o di&s;courage our troops, as to break up our army. If they have not &s;ome &s;uch expectations, the i&s;&s;ue of which they are determined to wait, I cannot account for the delay, when their &s;trength is le&s;&s;ened every day by &s;ickne&s;s, de&s;ertions, and little &s;kirmi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e la&s;t we have had only two worthy of notice. Having &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect they were extending their lines at Charle&s;town, I, la&s;t Saturday evening, ordered &s;ome of the riflemen down, to make a di&s;covery, or bring off a pri&s;oner. They were accidentally di&s;covered &s;oon|er than they expected, by the guard coming to relieve, and obliged to fire upon them. We have rea&s;on to believe they killed &s;everal. They brought in two pri&s;oners, who&s;e account (confirmed by &s;ome other circum&s;tances) removed my &s;u&s;picions in part. Since that time, we have, on each &s;ide, drawn in our c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ntries, and there have been &s;catter|ing fires along the line. This evening we have heard of three captains who have been taken off by the riflemen, and one killed by a cannon-&s;hot from Roxbury, be&s;ides &s;ev|eral privates: but as the intelligence is not direct, I only mention it as a report which de&s;erves credit&punc; The other happened at the light-hou&s;e. A number of workmen hav|ing been &s;ent down to repair it, with a guard of twenty-two marines and a &s;ubaltern,&mdash;major Tupper, la&s;t Monday morning about two o'clock, landed there with about three hundred men, attacked them, killed the officer and four privates; but being detained by the tide, in his return he was attacked by &s;everal boats; but he happily got through with the lo&s;s of one man killed, and another wounded. The remainder of the mini&s;terial troops (three of whom are badly wounded) he brought off pri&s;oners, with ten to|ries, all of whom are on their way to Springfield jail. The riflemen, in the&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hes, lo&s;t one man, who (we hear) is a pri&s;oner in Bo&s;ton jail. The enemy, in return, endeav|oured to &s;urpri&s;e our guard at Roxbury: but they, being
<PB N="25" REF="029737_0024_0FE24683AE7474C0">
appri&s;ed of it by a de&s;erter, had time to prepare for it: but by &s;ome negligence or mi&s;conduct in the officer of the guard, they burned the George tavern on the neck; and have every day &s;ince been cannonading us from their lines, both at Roxbury and Charle&s;town, but with no other effect than the lo&s;s of two men. On our part, except &s;traggling fires from the &s;mall arms about the lines, which we endeavour to re&s;train, we have made little or no return.</P>
<P>Our &s;ituation in the article of powder, is much more alarming than I had the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of. Having de|&s;ired a return to be made out (on my arrival) of the am|munition, I found three hundred and three barrels and a half of powder mentioned as in the &s;tore: but on ordering a new &s;upply of cartridges ye&s;terday, I was informed, to my very great a&s;toni&s;hment, that there was no more than thirty-&s;ix barrels of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts &s;tore, which, with the &s;tock of Rhode-I&s;land, New-Hamp&s;hire, and Connec|ticut, makes nine thou&s;and nine hundred and thirty-&s;even pounds,&mdash;not more than nine rounds a man. As there had been no con&s;umption of powder &s;ince, that could in any degree account for &s;uch a deficiency, I was very par|ticular in my inquiries, and found that the committee of &s;upplies, not being &s;ufficiently acquainted with the nature of a return, or mi&s;apprehending my reque&s;t, &s;ent in an ac|count of all the ammunition which had been collected by the province; &s;o that the report included not only what was in hand, but what had been &s;pent.</P>
<P>Upon di&s;covering this mi&s;take, I immediately went up to confer with the &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, upon &s;ome mea&s;ures to obtain a &s;upply from the neighbour|ing town&s;hips, in &s;uch a manner as might prevent our pov|erty being known; as it is a &s;ecret of too great con&s;e|quence to be divulged in the general court, &s;ome individu|al of which might perhaps indi&s;creetly &s;uffer it to e&s;cape him, &s;o as to find its way to the enemy,&mdash;the con&s;equences of which are terrible even in idea. I &s;hall al&s;o write to the governors of Rhode-I&s;land and Connecticut, and the com|mittee of &s;afety in New-Hamp&s;hire, on this &s;ubject, urging, in the mo&s;t forcible terms, the nece&s;&s;ity of an immediate &s;upply, if in their power. I need not enlarge on our mel|ancholy &s;ituation: it is &s;ufficient that the exi&s;tence of the
<PB N="26" REF="029737_0025_0FE2468533AA1300">
army and the &s;alvation of the country depends upon &s;ome|thing being done for our relief, both &s;peedy and effectual&punc; and that our &s;ituation be kept a profound &s;ecret.</P>
<P>In the inclo&s;ures, N^o 2 and 3, I &s;end the allowance of provi&s;ions, &amp;c. made by the provinces of Connecticut and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. The mode and quantity are different from what has fallen within my experience, and, I am confident, mu&s;t prove very wa&s;teful and expen&s;ive. If any alteration can be &s;afety made (which I much doubt) there might be a great &s;aving to the public.</P>
<P>A gentleman of my family, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a de&s;erter who has &s;ome &s;kill in fortification, has, by my direction, &s;ketched out two draughts of our re&s;pective lines at Charle&s;town and Roxbury, which, with the explanations, will convey &s;ome idea of our &s;ituation, and, I hope, prove acceptable to the members of the honourable Congre&s;s. They are the in-clo&s;ures, N^o 4 and 5.</P>
<P>Since I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you la&s;t, I have been applied to, by a committee of the general court, for a detachment of the army, to protect the inhabitants of the ea&s;tern parts of this province from &s;ome apprehended dep|redations on their coa&s;ts. I could have wi&s;hed to have complied with their reque&s;t: but, after due con&s;ideration&punc; and con&s;ulting the general officers, together with tho&s;e members of Congre&s;s who are here, I thought it my duty to excu&s;e my&s;elf. The application and my an&s;wer are the inclo&s;ures, N^o 6 and 7, which I hope will be approved by the honourable Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Since I began this letter, the original (of which the in|clo&s;ure N^o 8 is a copy) fell into my hands. As the writer is a per&s;on of &s;ome note in Bo&s;ton, and it contains &s;ome advices of importance not mentioned by others, I thought proper to forward it as I received it. By comparing the hand-writing with another letter, it appears the writer is one Belcher Noyes, a per&s;on probably known to &s;ome of the gentlemen, delegates from this province, who can de|termine, from his principles and character, what credit is due to him.</P>
<P>The army is now formed into three grand divi&s;ions, under the command of the generals Ward, Lee, and Put|nam; each divi&s;ion into two brigades, con&s;i&s;ting of about
<PB N="27" REF="029737_0026_0FE2468EA32544C8">
&s;ix regiments each, commanded by generals Thomas and Spencer at Roxbury,&mdash;Heath at Cambridge,&mdash;Sullivan and Greene at Winter-hill. By this, you will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, there is a deficiency of one brigadier-general (oc|ca&s;ioned by Mr. Pomroy's not acting under his com|mi&s;&s;ion) which I beg may be filled up as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. I ob&s;erve the honourable Congre&s;s have al&s;o favoured me with the appointment of three brigade-majors. I pre&s;ume they have or intend to appoint the re&s;t &s;oon, as they cannot be unacquainted that one is nece&s;&s;ary to each brigade; and in a new rai&s;ed army, it will be an office of great duty and &s;ervice.</P>
<P>General Gage has at length liberated the people of Bo&s;|ton, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in numbers at Chel&s;ea every day. The terms on which the pa&s;&s;es are granted, as to money, effects and provi&s;ions, corre&s;pond with Mr. Noyes's letter.</P>
<P>We have &s;everal reports that general Gage is di&s;man|tling Ca&s;tle-William, and bringing all the cannon up to town: but, upon a very particular inquiry, accounts are &s;o various, that I cannot a&s;certain the truth of it.* * *</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t in&s;tant, a chief of the Caghnewaga tribe, who live about &s;ix miles from Montreal, came in here, accompained by a colonel Bayley of Coho&s;s. His accounts of the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the Indians are very fa|vourable. He &s;ays they have been &s;trongly &s;olicited by governor Carleton to engage again&s;t us; but his nation is totally aver&s;e;&mdash;that threats, as well as entreaties, have been u&s;ed without effect;&mdash;that the Canadians are well di&s;|po&s;ed to the Engli&s;h colonies; and, if any expedition is meditated again&s;t Canada, the Indians in that quarter will give all their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I have endeavoured to cheri&s;h the&s;e favourable di&s;po&s;itions, and have recommended to him to cultivate them on his return. What I have &s;aid, I en|forced with a pre&s;ent, which I under&s;tood would be agreea|ble to him: and as he is repre&s;ented to be a man of weight and con&s;equence in his own tribe, I flatter my&s;elf his vi&s;it will have a good effect. His accounts of general Carle|ton's force and &s;ituation at St. John's corre&s;pond with what we have already had from that quarter.</P>
<P>The acce&s;&s;ion of Georgia to the mea&s;ures of the Con|gre&s;s is a happy event, and mu&s;t give a &s;incere plea&s;ure to every friend of America.</P>

<P>I have this morning been alarmed with an information that two gentlemen from Philadelphia, (Mr. Hitchbourn and captain White) with letters for general Lee and my|&s;elf, have been taken by captain Ay&s;cough at Rhode-I&s;land, the letters intercepted and &s;ent forward to Bo&s;ton,&mdash;with the bearers as pri&s;oners; that the captain exulted much in the di&s;coveries he had made: and my informer (who was al&s;o in the boat, but relea&s;ed) under&s;tood them to be letters of con&s;equence. I have therefore di&s;patched the expre&s;s immediately back, though I had before re&s;olved to detain him till Fe&s;&s;enden's return.

The former is colonel John Arm&s;trong, of Penn&s;ylvania: he &s;erved during the la&s;t war, in mo&s;t of the campaigns to the &s;outhward; was honoured with the command of the Penn&s;ylvania forces, and his general military conduct and &s;pirit much approved by all who &s;erved with him: be&s;ides which, his character was di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by an enterpri&s;e again&s;t the Indians, which he planned with great judgment, and executed with equal courage and &s;ucce&s;s. It was not till lately that I had rea|&s;on to believe he would enter again on public &s;ervice; and it is now wholly un&s;olicited and unknown on his part. The other gentleman is colonel Fry, of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay. He entered into the &s;ervice as early as 1745, and ro&s;e through the different military ranks, in the &s;ucceeding wars, to that of colonel, until la&s;t June, when he was ap|pointed a major-general by the Congre&s;s of this province. From the&s;e circum&s;tances, together with the favourable report made to me of him, I pre&s;ume he &s;u&s;tained the character of a good officer, though I do not find it di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by any peculiar &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Either of the&s;e gentlemen, or any other whom the hon|ourable Congre&s;s &s;hall plea&s;e to favour with this appoint|ment, will be received by me with the utmo&s;t deference and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The late adjournment having made it impracticable to know the plea&s;ure of the Congre&s;s as to the appointment of brigade-majors, beyond the number of three which they were plea&s;ed to leave to me,&mdash;and the &s;ervice not admitting of farther delay,&mdash;I have continued the other three: which I hope their honours will not di&s;approve. The&s;e latter were recommended by the re&s;pective corps to which they belong, as the propere&s;t per&s;ons for the&s;e offices until farther direction, and have di&s;charged the duty ever &s;ince. They are the majors Box, Scammel, and Samuel Brewer.</P>

La&s;t Saturday night we took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hill con|&s;iderably advanced beyond our former lines; which brought on a very heavy cannonade from Bunker's-hill, and after|wards a bombardment, which has been &s;ince kept up with little &s;pirit on their part, or damage on ours.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been in daily expectation of being favoured with the commands of the honourable Congre&s;s, on the &s;ubject of my two la&s;t letters. The &s;ea&s;on now advances &s;o fa&s;t that I cannot any longer defer laying before them &s;uch farther mea&s;ures as require their immediate attention, and in which I wait their direction.</P>
<P>The mode in which the pre&s;ent army has been collected has occa&s;ioned &s;ome difficulty in procuring the &s;ub&s;cription of both officers and &s;oldiers to the continental articles of war. Their principal objection has been, that it might &s;ubject them to a longer &s;ervice than that for which they engaged under their &s;everal provincial e&s;tabli&s;hments. It is in vain to attempt to rea&s;on away the prejudices of a whole army: * * * I have therefore forbore pre&s;&s;ing them, as I did not experience any &s;uch inconvenience from their adherence to their former rules, as would warrant the ri&s;k of entering into a conte&s;t upon it: more e&s;pecially as the re&s;traints, nece&s;&s;ary for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of e&s;&s;ential di&s;ci|pline and &s;ubordination, indi&s;po&s;ed their minds to every change, and made it both duty and policy to introduce as little novelty as po&s;&s;ible. With the pre&s;ent army, I fear &s;uch a &s;ub&s;cription is impracticable: but the difficulty will cea&s;e with this army.</P>
<P>The Connecticut and Rhode-I&s;land troops &s;tand engag|ed to the fir&s;t of December only; and none longer than the fir&s;t of January. A di&s;&s;olution of the pre&s;ent army
<PB N="33" REF="029737_0032_0FE2469F602AD148">
therefore will take place, unle&s;s &s;ome early provi&s;ion is made again&s;t &s;uch an event. Mo&s;t of the general officers are of opinion the greater part of them may be re-enli&s;ted for the winter, or another campaign, with the indulgence of a furlough to vi&s;it their friends, which may be regulated &s;o as not to endanger the &s;ervice. How far it may be proper to form the new army entirely out of the old, for another campaign, rather than from the contingents of the &s;everal provinces, is a que&s;tion which involves in it too ma|ny con&s;iderations of policy and prudence, for me to under|take to decide. It appears to be impo&s;&s;ible to draw it from any other &s;ource than the old army, for this winter; and, as the pay is ample, I hope a &s;ufficient number will engage in the &s;ervice for that time at lea&s;t. But there are various opinions of the temper of the men on the &s;ubject; and there may be great hazard in deferring the trial &s;o long.</P>
<P>In the continental e&s;tabli&s;hment, no provi&s;ion has been made for the pay of artificers, di&s;tinct from that of the common &s;oldiers; whereas, under the provincial, &s;uch as found their own tools were allowed one &s;hilling per diem advance, and particular artizans, more. The pay of the artillery al&s;o now differs from that of the province; the men have le&s;s, the officers more; and, for &s;ome ranks, no pro|vi&s;ion is made, as the Congre&s;s will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve by the li&s;t which I have the honour to inclo&s;e. (N^o 1.) The&s;e par|ticulars, though &s;eemingly incon&s;iderable, are the &s;ource of much complaint and di&s;&s;atisfaction, which I endeavour to compo&s;e in the be&s;t manner I am able.</P>
<P>By the returns of the rifle companies, and that battalion, they appear to exceed their e&s;tabli&s;hment very con&s;iderably. I doubt my authority to pay the&s;e extra men without the direction of the Congre&s;s: but it would be deemed a great hard&s;hip wholly to refu&s;e them, as they have been en|couraged to come.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ities of the troops having required pay, I di|rected that tho&s;e of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts &s;hould receive for one month, upon their being mu&s;tered, and returning a proper roll: but a claim was immediately made for pay by lunar months; and &s;everal regiments have declined taking up their warrants on this account. As this practice was en|tirely new to me, though &s;aid to be warranted by former
<PB N="34" REF="029737_0033_0FE246A0E4383398">
u&s;age, here the matter now waits the determination of the honourable Congre&s;s. I find, in Connecticut and Rhode-I&s;land, this point was &s;ettled by calendar months: in Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts, though mentioned in the Congre&s;s, it was left undetermined; which is al&s;o the ca&s;e of New-Hamp&s;hire.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ure, N^o 2, is a petition from the &s;ubalterns, re&s;pecting their pay. Where there are only two of the&s;e in a company, I have con&s;idered one as an en&s;ign, and or|dered him pay as &s;uch, as in the Connecticut forces. I mu&s;t beg leave to recommend this petition to the favour of the Congre&s;s; as I am of opinion the allowance is inadequate to their rank and &s;ervice, and is one great &s;ource of that familiarity between the officers and men, which is &s;o incom|patible with &s;ubordination and di&s;cipline. Many valuable officers of tho&s;e ranks, finding them&s;elves unable to &s;upport the character and appearance of officers, (I am informed) will retire as &s;oon as the term of &s;ervice is expired, if there is no alteration.</P>
<P>For the better regulation of duty, I found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ettle the rank of the officers, and to number the regiments; and, as I had not received the commands of the Congre&s;s on the &s;ubject, and the exigence of the &s;ervice forbade any farther delay, the general officers were con&s;idered as having no regiments; an alteration, which, I under&s;tand, is not plea&s;ing to &s;ome of them, but appeared to me and others to be proper, when it was con&s;idered, that, by this means, the whole army is put upon one footing, and all particular at|tachments di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>Among many other con&s;iderations which the approach of winter will demand, that of clothing appears to be one of the mo&s;t important. So far as regards the pre&s;ervation of the army from cold, they may be deemed in a &s;tate of nakedne&s;s. Many of the men have been without blankets the whole campaign: and tho&s;e, which have been in u&s;e during the &s;ummer, are &s;o much worn as to be of little &s;ervice. In order to make a &s;uitable provi&s;ion in the&s;e arti|cles, and at the &s;ame to guard the public again&s;t impo&s;ition and expen&s;e, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to determine the mode of continuing the army: for, &s;hould the&s;e troops be clothed under their pre&s;ent engagement, and, at the expiration of
<PB N="35" REF="029737_0034_0FE246AAE9D91AB0">
the term of &s;ervice, decline renewing it, a &s;et of unprovid|ed men may be &s;ent to &s;upply their places.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;uppo&s;e it&punc; to be unknown to the honourable Congre&s;s, that, in all armies, it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed practice to make an allowance to officers, of provi&s;ions and forage, pro|portionate to their rank. As &s;uch an allowance formed no part of the continental e&s;tabli&s;hment, I have hitherto forbore to i&s;&s;ue the orders for that purpo&s;e: but, as it is a received opinion of &s;uch members of the Congre&s;s as I have had an opportunity of con&s;ulting, as well as throughout <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> army, that it mu&s;t be deemed a matter of cour&s;e and im|plied in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the army, I have directed the following proportion of rations, being the &s;ame allowed in the American armies la&s;t war:&mdash;Major-general, fifteen; brigadier-general, twelve; colonel, &s;ix; lieutenant-colonel, five; major, four; captain, three; &s;ubaltern, two; &s;taff, two.</P>
<P>If the&s;e &s;hould not be approved by the honourable Con|gre&s;s, they will plea&s;e to &s;ignify their plea&s;ure, as to the alterations they would have made in the whole or in part.</P>
<P>I am now to inform the honourable Congre&s;s, that, en|couraged by the repeated declarations of the Canadians and Indians, and u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ged by their reque&s;ts, I have detached col|onel Arnold with a thou&s;and men, to penetrate into Cana|da by way of Kennebeck river, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to make him|&s;elf ma&s;ter of Quebec. By this manoeuvre, I propo&s;ed ei|ther to divert Carleton from St. John's, which would leave a free pa&s;&s;age to general Schuyler;&mdash;or, if this did not take effect, Quebec, in its pre&s;ent defencele&s;s &s;tate, mu&s;t fall into his hands an ea&s;y prey. I made all po&s;&s;ible inquiry, as to the di&s;tance, the &s;afety of the route, and the danger of the &s;ea&s;on being too far advanced; but found nothing in either, to deter me from proceeding, more e&s;pecially as it met with very general approbation from all whom I con&s;ulted upon it. But, that nothing might be omitted, to enable me to judge of its propriety and probable con&s;equences, I communicated it by expre&s;s to general Schuyler, who approved of it in &s;uch terms, that I re&s;olved to put it in immediate execu|tion. They have now left this place &s;even days: and, if favoured with a good wind, I hope &s;oon to hear of their being &s;afe in Kennebeck river. For the &s;atisfaction of the
<PB N="36" REF="029737_0035_0FE246AC6E74F5A8">
Congre&s;s, I here inclo&s;e a copy of the propo&s;ed route. (N^o 3.) I al&s;o do my&s;elf the honour of inclo&s;ing a mani|fe&s;to, which I cau&s;ed to be printed here, and of which col|onel Arnold has taken a &s;uitable number with him. This is the inclo&s;ure, N^o 4. I have al&s;o forwarded a copy of his in&s;tructions (N^o 5)&mdash;from all which I hope the Con|gre&s;s will have a clear view of the motives, plan, and in|tended execution of this enterpri&s;e, and that I &s;hall be &s;o happy as to meet with their approbation in it.</P>
<P>I was the more induced to make this detachment, as it is my clear opinion, from a careful ob&s;ervation of the move|ments of the enemy, corroborated by all the intelligence we receive by de&s;erters and others, (of the former of whom we have &s;ome every day) that the enemy have no intention to come out, until they are reinforced. They have been wholly employed for &s;ome time pa&s;t in procuring materials for barracks, fuel, and making other preparations for winter. The&s;e circum&s;tances, with the con&s;tant additions to their works which are apparently defen&s;ive, have led to the above conclu&s;ion, and enabled me to &s;pare this body of men where I hope they will be u&s;efully and &s;ucce&s;sfully employed.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of inactivity, in which this army has lain for &s;ome time, by no means corre&s;ponds with my wi&s;hes, by &s;ome deci&s;ive &s;troke to relieve my country from the heavy expen&s;e its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence mu&s;t create. After frequently rec|onnoitring the &s;ituation of the enemy in the town of Bo&s;|ton, collecting all po&s;&s;ible intelligence, and dige&s;ting the whole, a &s;urpri&s;e did not appear to me wholly impracticable, though hazardous. I communicated it to the general offi|cers &s;ome days before I called them to a council, that they might be prepared with their opinions. The re&s;ult I have the honour of inclo&s;ing. (N^o 6.) I cannot &s;ay that I have wholly laid it a&s;ide: but new events may occa&s;ion new mea&s;ures. Of this I hope the honourable Congre&s;s can need no a&s;&s;urance, that there is not a man in America who more earne&s;tly wi&s;hes &s;uch a termination of the campaign, as to make the army no longer nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on advances &s;o fa&s;t, that I have given orders to prepare barracks and other accommodations for the winter. The great &s;carcity of tow-cloth in this country, I fear, will totally di&s;appoint as in our expectations of procuring hunt|ing-&s;hirts.
<PB N="37" REF="029737_0036_0FE246ADF4A55350">
Governor Cooke informs me, few or none are to be had in Rhode-I&s;land; and governor Trumbull gives me little encouragement to expect many from Connecticut.</P>
<P>I have filled up the office of quarter-ma&s;ter-general, which the Congre&s;s was plea&s;ed to leave to me, by the appoint|ment of major Mifflin, which I hope and believe will be univer&s;ally acceptable.</P>
<P>It gives me great pain to be obliged to &s;olicit the atten|tion of the honourable Congre&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o the &s;tate of this army, in terms which imply the &s;lighte&s;t apprehen&s;ion of being neg|lected. But my &s;ituation is inexpre&s;&s;ibly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, to &s;ee the winter fa&s;t approaching upon a naked army; the time of their &s;ervice within a few weeks of expiring; and no pro|vi&s;ion yet made for &s;uch important events. Added to the&s;e, the military che&s;t is totally exhau&s;ted: the pay-ma&s;|ter has not a &s;ingle dollar in hand: the commi&s;&s;ary-general a&s;&s;ures me he has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">trained his credit, for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the army, to the utmo&s;t. The quarter-ma&s;ter-general is preci&s;ely in the &s;ame &s;ituation; and the greater part of the troops are in a &s;tate not far from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">utiny, upon the deduction from their &s;tated allowance. I know not to whom I am to impute this failure: but I am of opinion, if the evil is not immediately remedied, and more punctuality ob&s;erved in future, the army mu&s;t ab&s;olutely break up. I hoped I had &s;o fully expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf on this &s;ubject, (both by letter, and to tho&s;e members of the Congre&s;s who honoured the camp with a vi&s;it) that no di&s;appointment could po&s;&s;ibly happen: I therefore hourly expected advice from the pay|ma&s;ter that he had received a fre&s;h &s;upply, in addition to the hundred and &s;eventy-two thou&s;and dollars delivered him in Augu&s;t: and thought my&s;elf warranted to a&s;&s;ure the public creditors that in a few days they &s;hould be &s;atisfied. But the delay has brought matters to &s;uch a cri&s;is, as ad|mits of no farther uncertain expectation. I have therefore &s;ent off this expre&s;s, with orders to make all po&s;&s;ible di&s;|patch. It is my mo&s;t earne&s;t reque&s;t that he may be re|turned with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, unle&s;s the honourable Congre&s;s have already forwarded what is &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>THE reverend Mr. Kirkland, the bearer of this, having been introduced to the honourable Congre&s;s, can need no particular recommendation from me. But as he now wi&s;hes to have the affairs of his mi&s;&s;ion and public employ put upon &s;ome &s;uitable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ooting, I cannot but intimate my &s;en&s;e of the importance of his &s;tation, and the great advan|tages which have and may re&s;ult to the United Colonies, from his &s;ituation being made re&s;pectable.</P>
<P>All accounts agree that much of the favourable di&s;po&s;ition &s;hewn by the Indians, may be a&s;cribed to his labour and in|fluence. He has accompanied a chief of the Oneidas to this camp, which I have endeavoured to make agreeable to him, both by civility and &s;ome &s;mall pre&s;ents.

<P>I cannot but congratulate the honourable Congre&s;s on the happy temper of the Canadians and Indians, our accounts of which are now fully confirmed by &s;ome intercepted let|ters from officers in Canada, to general Gage and others in Bo&s;ton, which were found on board the ve&s;&s;el lately taken, going into Bo&s;ton with a donation of cattle and other fre&s;h provi&s;ions for the mini&s;terial army.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honoured with your favour of the twenty|&s;ixth ultimo, late the night before la&s;t; and a meeting of the general officers having been called upon a bu&s;ine&s;s which will make a con&s;iderable part of this letter. I took the op|portunity of laying before them tho&s;e parts of yours which re&s;pect the continuance and new-modelling of the army, the fuel, clothing, and other preparations for the en&s;uing winter. They have taken two or three days to con&s;ider; and, as &s;oon as I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their opinions, I &s;hall lo&s;e no time in tran&s;mitting the re&s;ult, not only on the above &s;ub|jects, but the number of troops nece&s;&s;ary to be kept up.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="029737_0038_0FE246B9007F8488">
I have al&s;o directed the commi&s;&s;ary-general and the quar|ter-ma&s;ter-general to prepare e&s;timates of the expen&s;e of their departments for a certain given number of men, from which a judgment may be made, when the number of men to be kept in pay is determined:&mdash;all which I &s;hall do my|&s;elf the honour to lay before the Congre&s;s, as &s;oon as they are ready.</P>
<P>I have now a painful though a nece&s;&s;ary duty to perform, re&s;pecting Dr. Church, director-general of the ho&s;pital. About a week ago, Mr. &s;ecretary Ward, of Providence, &s;ent up to me one Wainwood, an inhabitant of Newport, with a letter directed to major Cane, in Bo&s;ton, in <HI>[occult]</HI> char|acters, which he &s;aid had been left with Wainwood &s;ome time ago, by a woman who was kept by Dr. Church. She had before pre&s;&s;ed Wainwood to take her to captain Wal|lace, Mr. Dudley the collector, or George Rome; which he declined. She then gave him the letter, with a &s;trict charge to deliver it to either of tho&s;e gentlemen. He, &s;u&s;|pecting &s;ome improper corre&s;pondence, kept the letter, and after &s;ome time opened it; but, not being able to read it, laid it up, where it remained until he received an ob&s;cure letter from the woman, expre&s;&s;ing an anxiety after the origi|nal letter. He then communicated the whole matter to Mr. Ward, who &s;ent him up with the papers to me. I im|mediately &s;ecured the woman: but for a long time &s;he was proof again&s;t every threat and per&s;ua&s;ion to di&s;cover the au|thor. However, at length &s;he was brought to a confe&s;&s;ion, and named Dr. Church. I then immediately &s;ecured him and all his papers. Upon his fir&s;t examination, he readily acknowledged the letter, &s;aid it was de&s;igned for his brother Fleming, and, when deciphered, would be found to contain nothing criminal. He acknowledged his never having com|municated the corre&s;pondence to any per&s;on here but the girl, and made many prote&s;tations of the purity of his inten|tions. Having found a per&s;on capable of deciphering the letter, I in the mean time had all his papers &s;earched, but found nothing criminal among them: but it appeared on in|quiry, that a confidant had been among the papers before my me&s;&s;enger arrived. I then called the general officers together for their advice, the re&s;ult of which you will find in the inclo&s;ure, N^o 1. The deciphered letter is the inclo|&s;ure,
<PB N="40" REF="029737_0039_0FE246BAEC4ACE60">
N^o 2. The army and country are exceedingly irri|tated: and upon a free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the nature, circum|&s;tances, and con&s;equence of this matter, it has been unani|mou&s;ly agreed to lay it before the honourable Congre&s;s for their &s;pecial advice and direction; at the &s;ame time &s;ug|ge&s;ting to their con&s;ideration, whether an alteration of the twenty-eighth article of war may not be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>As I &s;hall re&s;erve all farther remarks upon the &s;tate of the army till my next, I &s;hall now beg leave to reque&s;t the determination of Congre&s;s, as to the property and di&s;po&s;al of &s;uch ve&s;&s;els and cargoes as are de&s;igned for the &s;upply of the enemy, and may fall into our hands. There has been an event of this kind at Port&s;mouth, (as by the inclo&s;ure, N^o 3) in which I have directed the cargo to be brought hither for the u&s;e of the army, re&s;erving the &s;ettlement of any claims of capture to the deci&s;ion of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>As there are many unfortunate individuals who&s;e prop|erty has been confi&s;cated by the enemy, I would humbly &s;ugge&s;t to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s the humanity of ap|plying, in part or in the whole, &s;uch captures to the relief of tho&s;e &s;ufferers, after compen&s;ating any expen&s;e of the cap|tors, and for their activity and &s;pirit. I am the more indue|ed to reque&s;t this determination may be &s;peedy, as I have directed three ve&s;&s;els to be equipped in order to cut off the &s;upplies; and, from the number of ve&s;&s;els hourly arriving, it may become an object of &s;ome importance. In the di&s;po|&s;al of the&s;e captures, for the encouragement of the officers and men, I have allowed them one third of the cargoes, ex|cept military &s;tores, which, with the ve&s;&s;els, are to be re|&s;erved for the public u&s;e. I hope my plan, as well as the execution, will be favoured with the approbation of Con|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>One Mr. Fi&s;k, an intelligent per&s;on, came out of Bo&s;ton on the third in&s;t. and gives us the following advices:&mdash;that a fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;ixty-four, and twenty-gun &s;hip, two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">loops of eighteen guns, and two tran&s;ports with &s;ix hun|dred men, were to &s;ail from Bo&s;ton as ye&s;terday; that they took on board two mortars, four howitzers, and other artil|lery calculated for the bombardment of a town:&mdash;their de&s;|tination was kept a profound &s;ecret:&mdash;that an expre&s;s &s;loop of war, which left England the eighth of Augu&s;t, arrived
<PB N="41" REF="029737_0040_0FE246BC7111EB90">
four days ago;&mdash;that general Gage is recalled, and la&s;t Sun|day re&s;igned his command to general Howe;&mdash;that lord Percy, colonel Smith, and other officers who were at Lex|ington, are ordered home with Gage;&mdash;that &s;ix &s;hips of the line and two cutters were coming out under Sir Peter Dennis;&mdash;that five regiments and a thou&s;and marines are ordered out, and may be expected in three or four weeks:&mdash;no pro&s;pect of accommodation; but the mini&s;try deter|mined to pu&s;h the war to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>I have an expre&s;s from colonel Arnold, and herewith &s;end a copy of his letter and an inclo&s;ure, N^o 4 and 5.&mdash;I am happy in finding he meets with no di&s;couragement. The claim of the rifle officers, to be independent of all the &s;uperior officers except colonel Arnold, is without any countenance or authority from me, as I have &s;ignified in my la&s;t di&s;patch both to colonel Arnold and captain Mor|gan. The captain of the brig from Quebec for Bo&s;ton in|forms me that there is no &s;u&s;picion of any &s;uch expedition; and that, if Carleton is not drove from St. John's, &s;o as to be obliged to throw him&s;elf into Quebec, it mu&s;t fall into our hands, as it is left without a regular &s;oldier, and many of the inhabitants are mo&s;t favourably di&s;po&s;ed to the American cau&s;e;&mdash;and that there is the large&s;t &s;tock of ammunition ever collected in America.</P>
<P>In the above ve&s;&s;el &s;ome letters were al&s;o found, from an officer at Quebec, to general Gage and major Sheriff at Bo&s;ton, containing &s;uch an account of the temper of the Canadians, as cannot but afford the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction. I have thought it be&s;t to forward them: they are the inclo|&s;ures, N^o 6 and 7.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with your &s;everal favours of the twenty-&s;ixth and thirtieth of September, and fifth of Octo|ber, the contents of which I &s;hall beg leave to notice in their re&s;pective order.</P>
<P>Previous to the direction of Congre&s;s to con&s;ult the gen|eral officers on the be&s;t mode of continuing and providing
<PB N="42" REF="029737_0041_0FE246BDF4FDD390">
for the army during the winter, I had de&s;ired them to tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> their thoughts upon the&s;e &s;ubjects, and to favour me with the re&s;ult, by a particular day, in writing. In this interval, the appointment of Dr. Franklin, Mr. Lynch, and colonel Harri&s;on, was communicated,&mdash;an event which has given me the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction, as the &s;ubject was too weighty and complex for a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion by letter. This appointment made any conclu&s;ion here unnece&s;&s;ary, as it is not probable any &s;uch arrangement would be agreed on, as would not be altered in &s;ome re&s;pects, upon a full and free conference. This good effect will ari&s;e from the &s;tep already taken, that every officer will be prepared to give his &s;entiments upon the&s;e important &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The e&s;timates of the commi&s;&s;ary and quarter-ma&s;ter|general I have now the honour of inclo&s;ing. The fir&s;t is N^o 1, the other N^o 2.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the reduction of the pay of the men, which may enter into the con&s;ideration of their &s;upport, it is the unanimous opinion of the general officers, that it cannot be touched with &s;afety at pre&s;ent. * * *</P>
<P>Upon the pre&s;umption of there being a vacancy in the direction of the ho&s;pital, lieutenant-colonel Hand, former|ly a &s;urgeon in the eighteenth regiment, or royal Iri&s;h, and Dr. Fo&s;ter, late of Charle&s;town, and one of the &s;urgeons of the ho&s;pital under Dr. Church, are candidates for that office. I do not pretend to be acquainted with their re|&s;pective merits, and therefore have given them no farther expectation, than that they &s;hould be mentioned as candi|dates for the department. I therefore need only to add upon this &s;ubject, that the affairs of the ho&s;pital require that the appointment &s;hould be made as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Before I was honoured with your favour of the fifth in|&s;tant, I had given orders for the equipment of &s;ome armed ve&s;&s;els, to intercept the enemy's &s;upplies of provi&s;ions and ammunition. One of them was on a crui&s;e between Cape Anne and Cape Cod, when the expre&s;s arrived. The others will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it for the &s;ea in a few days, under the com|mand of officers of the continental army, who are well rec|ommended, as per&s;ons acquainted with the &s;ea, and capa|ble of &s;uch a &s;ervice. Two of the&s;e will be immediately
<PB N="43" REF="029737_0042_0FE246C6A374D3F8">
di&s;patched on this duty, and every particular, mentioned in your favour of the fifth in&s;tant, literally complied with.</P>
<P>That the honourable Congre&s;s may have a more com|plete idea of the plan on which the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are equipped; I inclo&s;e a copy of the in&s;tructions given to the captains now out (N^o 4). The&s;e, with the additional in&s;truction directed, will be given to the captains who go into the mouth of St. Laurence's river. As both officers and men mo&s;t cheerfully engage in the &s;ervice on the terms men|tioned in the&s;e in&s;tructions, I fear that the propo&s;ed in|crea&s;e will create &s;ome difficulty, by making a difference between men engaged on &s;imilar &s;ervice. I have therefore not yet communicated this part of the plan, but re&s;erved an extra bounty as a reward for extraordinary activity. There are no armed ve&s;&s;els in this province; and governor Cooke informs me the enterpri&s;e can receive no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him, as one of the armed ve&s;&s;els of Rhode-I&s;land is on a long crui&s;e, and the other unfit for the &s;ervice. Nothing &s;hall be omitted to &s;ecure &s;ucce&s;s. A fortunate capture of an ordnance &s;hip would give new life to the camp, and an immediate turn to the i&s;&s;ue of this campaign.</P>
<P>Our la&s;t accouts from colonel Arnold are very favoura|ble: he was proceeding with all expedition; and I flatter my&s;elf (making all allowances) he will be at Quebec the twentieth in&s;tant, where a gentleman from Canada (Mr. * * *) a&s;&s;ures me he will meet with no re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In the quarter-ma&s;ter's e&s;timate, there are &s;ome arti|cles omitted, of which he informs me he cannot pretend to furni&s;h a computation,&mdash;&s;uch as cartage, tools, &amp;c. for which &s;ome general allowance mu&s;t be made.</P>
<P>From the various accounts received from Europe, there may be rea&s;on to expect troops will be landed at New-York, or &s;ome other middle colony. I &s;hould be glad to know the plea&s;ure of the Congre&s;s, whether, upon &s;uch an event, it would be expected that a part of this army &s;hould be detached, or the internal force of &s;uch colony and its neighbourhood be deemed &s;ufficient; or whether, in &s;uch ca&s;e, I am to wait the particular direction of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The fleet, mentioned in my la&s;t, has been &s;een &s;tanding N. N. E.; &s;o that we apprehend it is intended for &s;ome
<PB N="44" REF="029737_0043_0FE246C875D60350">
part of this province, or New-Hamp&s;hire, or po&s;&s;ibly Que|bec.</P>
<P>The late&s;t and be&s;t accounts we have from the enemy are, that they are engaged in their new work acro&s;s the &s;outh end of Bo&s;ton, preparing their barracks, &amp;c. for win|ter:&mdash;that it is propo&s;ed to keep from five hundred to a thou&s;and men on Bunker's hill all winter, who are to be relieved once a week;&mdash;the re&s;t to be drawn into Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>A per&s;on who has lately been a &s;ervant to major Conolly (a tool of lord Dunmore's) has given an account of a &s;cheme to di&s;tre&s;s the &s;outhern provinces, which ap|peared to me of &s;ufficient con&s;equence to be immediately tran&s;mitted. I have therefore got it atte&s;ted, and do my|&s;elf the honour of inclo&s;ing it, N^o 5.</P>
<P>The new levies from Connecticut have lately marched into camp, and are a body of as good troops as any we have: &s;o that we have now the &s;ame &s;trength as before the detachment made under colonel Arnold.</P>
<P>I am, with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful &s;entiments to the honoura|ble Congre&s;s, and your&s;elf, Sir, your mo&s;t obedient, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY conjecture of the de&s;tination of the late &s;quadron from Bo&s;ton, in my la&s;t, has been unhappily verified by an outrage, exceeding, in barbarity and cruelty, every ho&s;tile act practi&s;ed among civilized nations. I have inclo&s;ed the account given me by Mr. Jones, a gentleman of the town of Falmouth, of the de&s;truction of that increa&s;ing and flour|i&s;hing village. He is a very great &s;ufferer, and informs me that the time allowed for the removal of effects was &s;o &s;mall, that valuable property of all kinds, and to a great amount, has been de&s;troyed. The orders &s;hewn by the captain for this horrid procedure (by which it appears the &s;ame de&s;o|lation is meditated upon all the towns on the coa&s;t) made it my duty to communicate it as quickly and exten&s;ively as po&s;&s;ible. As Port&s;mouth was the next place to which he propo&s;ed to go, general Sullivan was permitted to go up, and give them his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice to ward off the blow. I flatter my&s;elf the like event will not happen

there, as they have a fortification of &s;ome &s;trength, and a ve&s;&s;el has arrived at a place called Sheep&s;cot, with fif|teen hundred pounds of powder.</P>

<P>THE information, which the gentlemen who have lately gone from hence can give the Congre&s;s, of the &s;tate and &s;ituation of the army, would have made a letter unnece&s;|&s;ary, if I did not &s;uppo&s;e there would be &s;ome anxiety to know the intentions of the army on the &s;ubject of the re|enli&s;tment.</P>
<P>Agreeably to the advice of tho&s;e gentlemen, and my own opinion, I immediately began by directing all &s;uch officers as propo&s;ed to continue, to &s;ignify their intentions as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. A great number of the returns are come in, from which I find that a very great proportion of the officers of the rank of captains, and under, will retire;&mdash;from pre&s;ent appearances, I may &s;ay, half,&mdash;but at lea&s;t, one third. It is with &s;ome concern al&s;o that I ob&s;erve, that many of the officers who retire di&s;courage the continuance of the men, and, I fear, will communicate the infection to them. Some have advi&s;ed, that tho&s;e of|ficers who decline the &s;ervice &s;hould be immediately di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed: but this would be very dangerous and inconve|nient. I confe&s;s I have great anxieties upon the &s;ubject, though I &s;till hope the pay and terms are &s;o advantageous, that intere&s;t, and, I hope al&s;o, a regard to their country, will retain a greater proportion of the privates than their officers. In &s;o important a matter, I &s;hall e&s;teem it my indi&s;pen&s;able duty, not only to act with all po&s;&s;ible pru|dence,

but to give the mo&s;t early and con&s;tant advice of my progre&s;s.</P>
<P>A &s;upply of clothing, equal to our nece&s;&s;ities, would greatly contribute to the encouragement and &s;atisfaction of the men. In every point of view, it is &s;o important, that I beg leave to call the attention of the Congre&s;s to it in a particular manner.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE immediate occa&s;ion of my giving the Congre&s;s the trouble of a letter at this time is to inform them, that, in con&s;equence of their order &s;ignified in your letter of the twentieth ultimo, I laid my&s;elf under a &s;olemn tie of &s;ecre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y to captain M^cPher&s;on, and proceeded to examine his plan for the de&s;truction of the fleet in the harbour of Bo&s;|ton, with all that care and attention which the importance of it de&s;erved, and my judgment could lead to. But not be|ing happy enough to coincide in opinion with that gentleman, and finding that his &s;cheme would involve greater expen&s;e, than (under my doubts of its &s;ucce&s;s) I thought my&s;elf ju&s;ti|fied in giving into, I prevailed upon him to communicate his plan to three gentlemen of the artillery in this army, well acquainted in the knowledge and practice of gunnery. By them he has been convinced, that, ina&s;much as he &s;et out upon wrong principles, the &s;cheme would prove abortive. Unwilling however to relinqui&s;h his favourite project of re|ducing the naval force of Great-Britain, he is very de&s;irous of building a number of row-gallies for this purpo&s;e. But as the Congre&s;s alone are competent to the adoption of this mea&s;ure, I have advi&s;ed him (although he offered to go on with the building of them at his own expen&s;e, till the Con|gre&s;s &s;hould decide) to repair immediately to Philadelphia with his propo&s;als; where, if they &s;hould be agreed to, or ve&s;&s;els of &s;uperior force, agreeably to the wi&s;hes of mo&s;t others, &s;hould be re&s;olved on, he may &s;et in&s;tantly about them, with all the materials upon the &s;pot:&mdash;here, they are to collect. To him therefore I refer for further in|formation on this head.</P>
<P>A ve&s;&s;el, &s;aid to be from Philadelphia and bound to Bo&s;|ton, with a hundred and twenty pipes of wine (a hundred and eighteen of which are &s;ecured) &s;tranded at a place called Ea&s;tham, in a gale of wind on the &s;econd in&s;tant:&mdash;another from Bo&s;ton to Halifax, with dry goods, &amp;c. (amounting, per invoice, to about two hundred and forty pounds lawful) got di&s;abled in the &s;ame gale, near Beverly. The&s;e car|goes, with the papers, I have ordered to this place,&mdash;the ve&s;&s;els to be taken care of till further orders. I have al&s;o an account of the taking of a wood-&s;loop bound to Bo&s;ton,
<PB N="48" REF="029737_0047_0FE246D5C2455838">
and carried into Port&s;mouth by one of our armed ve&s;&s;els;&mdash;particulars not yet come to hand;&mdash;and this in&s;tant, of two others, from Nova-Scotia to Bo&s;ton, with hay, wood, live &s;tock, &amp;c. by another of our armed &s;chooners.&mdash;The&s;e are in Plymouth.</P>
<P>The&s;e accidents and captures point out the nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;tabli&s;hing proper courts without lo&s;s of time, for the de|ci&s;ion of property, and the legality of &s;eizures; otherwi&s;e I may be involved in inextricable difficulties.</P>
<P>Our pri&s;oners, by the reduction of Fort Chamblee (on which happy event I mo&s;t &s;incerely congratulate the Con|gre&s;s) being con&s;iderably augmented, and likely to be in|crea&s;ed, I &s;ubmit it to the wi&s;dom of Congre&s;s, whether &s;ome convenient inland towns, remote from the po&s;t-roads, ought not to be a&s;&s;igned them; the manner of their treat|ment, &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &amp;c. defined; and a commi&s;&s;ary or agent appointed, to &s;ee that ju&s;tice is done both to them and the public, proper accounts rendered, &amp;c. Without a mode of this &s;ort is adopted, I fear there will be &s;ad confu&s;ion hereafter, as there are great complaints at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I reckoned without my ho&s;t, when I informed the Con|gre&s;s in my la&s;t, that I &s;hould in a day or two be able to acquaint them of the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;oldiery towards a new enli&s;tment. I have been in con&s;ultation with the gen|erals of this army ever &s;ince Thur&s;day la&s;t, endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h new corps of officers; but find &s;o many doubts and difficulties to reconcile, that I cannot &s;ay when they are to end, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> con&s;equences; as there appears to be &s;uch an unwillingne&s;s in the officers of one government mixing in the &s;ame regiment with tho&s;e of another; and, without it, many mu&s;t be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed who are willing to &s;erve, notwith&s;tanding we are deficient on the whole.</P>
<P>The council of officers are unanimou&s;ly of opinion that the command of the artillery &s;hould no longer continue in colonel * * *; and knowing of no per&s;on better qual|ified to &s;upply his place, or who&s;e appointment will give more general &s;atisfaction, have taken the liberty of recom|mending Henry Knox, e&s;quire, to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, thinking it indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary at the &s;ame time that this regiment &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of two lieutenant-col|onels, two majors, and twelve companies, agreeably to the

plan and e&s;timate handed in; which, differing from the la&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, I &s;hould be glad to be in&s;tructed on.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ary-general not being returned, will apolo|gize, I hope, for my &s;ilence re&s;pecting a requi&s;ition of the expen&s;e of his clerks, &amp;c. which I was to have obtained together with others, and forwarded.</P>
<P>I have heard nothing of colonel Arnold &s;ince the thir|teenth ultimo. His letter of, and journal to, that date, will convey all the information I am able to give of him. I think he mu&s;t be in Quebec. If any mi&s;chance had hap|pened to him, he would, as directed, have forwarded an expre&s;s. No account yet of the armed ve&s;&s;els &s;ent to St. Laurence. I think they will meet the &s;tores inward or outward bound.</P>
<P>Captain Symons, in the Cerberus lately &s;ent from Bo&s;ton to Falmouth, hath publi&s;hed the inclo&s;ed declaration at that place; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd it is &s;u&s;pected he intends to make &s;ome kind of a lodgment there.

<P>* * * INCLOSED you have a copy of an act, pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, by the honourable council and hou&s;e of repre|&s;entatives of this province. It re&s;pects &s;uch captures as may be made by ve&s;&s;els fitted out by the province, or by individ|uals thereof. As the armed ve&s;&s;els, fitted out at the con|tinental expen&s;e, do not come under this law, I would have it &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, to point out a more &s;ummary way of proceeding, to determine the prop|erty and mode of condemnation of &s;uch prizes as have been or hereafter may be made, than is &s;pecified in this act.</P>
<P>Should not a court be e&s;tabli&s;hed by authority of Con|gre&s;s, to take cognizance of prizes made by the continental ve&s;&s;els? Whatever the mode is which they are plea&s;ed to
<PB N="50" REF="029737_0049_0FE246D8CAEE7258">
adopt, there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of its being &s;peedily de|termined on: for I cannot &s;pare time from military affairs, to give proper attention to the&s;e matters.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Plymouth have taken a &s;loop, laden with provi&s;ions, &amp;c. from Halifax, bound to Bo&s;ton: and the inhabitants of Beverly have, under cover of one of the armed &s;chooners, taken a ve&s;&s;el from Ireland, laden with beef, pork, butter, &amp;c. for the &s;ame place. The latter brings papers and letters of a very intere&s;ting nature, which are in the hands of the honourable council, who informed me they will tran&s;mit them to you by this conveyance. To the contents of the&s;e papers and letters I mu&s;t beg leave to refer you and the honourable Congre&s;s, who will now &s;ee the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity there is of exerting all their wi&s;|dom, to with&s;tand the mighty efforts of our enemies.</P>
<P>The trouble I have in the arrangement of the army is real|ly inconceivable. Many of the officers &s;ent in their names to &s;erve, in expectation of promotion: others &s;tood aloof * * *; whil&s;t a number who had declined have again &s;ent in their names, to &s;erve. So great has the confu&s;ion, ari&s;|ing from the&s;e and many other perplexing circum&s;tances, been, that I found it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to fix this very in|tere&s;ting bu&s;ine&s;s exactly on the plan re&s;olved on in the con|ference, though I have kept up to the &s;pirit, as near as the nature and nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e would admit of: the difficul|ty with the &s;oldiers is as great, indeed more &s;o, if po&s;&s;ible, than with the officers. They will not enli&s;t, until they know their colonel, lieutenant-colonel, major, captain, &amp;c.; &s;o that it was nece&s;&s;ary to fix the officers the fir&s;t thing; which is, at la&s;t, in &s;ome manner done; and I have given out enli&s;ting orders.</P>
<P>You, Sir, can much ea&s;ier judge, than I can expre&s;s, the anxiety of mind I mu&s;t labour under on the occa&s;ion, e&s;pecially at this time, when we may expect the enemy will begin to act on the arrival of their reinforcement, part of which is already come, and the remainder daily dropping in.</P>
<P>I have other di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a very alarming nature. The arms of our &s;oldiery are &s;o exceeding bad, that I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, I cannot place a proper confidence in them. Our powder is wa&s;ting fa&s;t, notwith&s;tanding the &s;tricte&s;t
<PB N="51" REF="029737_0050_0FE24732F4DF4358">
care, economy and attention are paid to it. The long &s;eries of wet weather we have had, renders the greater part of what has been &s;erved out to the men of no u&s;e. Ye&s;terday I had a proof of it, as a party of the enemy, about four or five hundred, taking the advantage of a high tide, landed at Leechmore's point: we were alarmed, and of cour&s;e ordered every man to examine his cartouch|box, when the melancholy truth appeared; and we were obliged to furni&s;h the greater part of them with fre&s;h am|munition.</P>
<P>The damage done at the point was the taking of a man who watched a few hor&s;es and cows: ten of the lat|ter they carried off. Colonel Thomp&s;on marched down with his regiment of riflemen, and was joined by colonel Woodbridge, with a part of his and a part of Patter&s;on's regiment, who gallantly waded through the water, and &s;oon obliged the enemy to embark under cover of a man-of-war, a floating battery, and the fire of a battery on Charle&s;town neck. We have two of our men dangerou&s;ly wounded by grape-&s;hot from the man-of-war; and, by a flag &s;ent out this day, we are informed the enemy lo&s;t two of their men.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your favours of the &s;eventh and tenth in&s;tant, with the re&s;olves of the honourable Congre&s;s, to which I will pay all due attention. As &s;oon as two ca|pable per&s;ons can be found, I will di&s;patch them to Nova-Scotia, on the &s;ervice re&s;olved on in Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The re&s;olve to rai&s;e two battalions of marines will (if practicable in this army) entirely derange what has been done. It is therein mentioned, "one colonel for the two battalions:"&mdash;of cour&s;e, a colonel mu&s;t be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. One of the many difficulties which attended the new ar|rangement, was in reconciling the different intere&s;ts, and judging of the merits of the different colonels. In the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of this one, the &s;ame difficulties will occur. The officers and men mu&s;t be acquainted with maritime
<PB N="52" REF="029737_0051_0FE246E1C161E1C0">
affairs; to comply with which, they mu&s;t be picked out of the whole army,&mdash;one from this corps, one from an|other,&mdash;&s;o as to break through the whole &s;y&s;tem, which has co&s;t us &s;o much time, anxiety and pains, to bring into any tolerable form. Notwith&s;tanding any difficulties which will ari&s;e, you may be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, that I will u&s;e every endeavour to comply with their re&s;olve.</P>
<P>I beg leave to &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of Con|gre&s;s (if the&s;e two battalions can be formed out of this army) whether this is a time to weaken our lines, by em|ploying any of the forces appointed to defend them, on any other &s;ervice. The gentlemen who were here from the Congre&s;s know their va&s;t extent: they mu&s;t know that we &s;hall have occa&s;ion for our whole force for that purpo&s;e; more &s;o now than at any pa&s;t time, as we may expect the enemy will take the advantage of the fir&s;t hard weather, and attempt to make an impre&s;&s;ion &s;omewhere. That this is their intention, we have many rea&s;ons to &s;u&s;|pect.</P>
<P>We have had, in the la&s;t week, &s;ix de&s;erters, and took two &s;traggling pri&s;oners. They all agree that two compa|nies, with a train of artillery and one of the regiments from Ireland, were arrived at Bo&s;ton;&mdash;that fre&s;h ammunition and flints have been &s;erved out;&mdash;that the grenadiers and light infantry had orders to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s at a moment's warning.</P>
<P>As there is every appearance that this conte&s;t will not be &s;oon decided, and of cour&s;e that there mu&s;t be an aug|mentation of the continental army, would it not be eligible to rai&s;e two battalions of marines in New-York and Phila|delphia, where there mu&s;t be numbers of &s;ailors now unem|ployed?&mdash;This however is matter of opinion, which I men|tion with all due deference to the &s;uperior judgment of the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed you have copies of two letters,&mdash;one from colonel Arnold,&mdash;the other from colonel * * *. I can form no judgment on the latter's conduct, until I &s;ee him. Notwith&s;tanding the great defection, I do not de&s;pair of colonel Arnold's &s;ucce&s;s. He will have, in all probabili|ty, many more difficulties to encounter than if he had been a fortnight &s;ooner; as it is likely that governor Carleton

The other crui&s;ers have been chiefly confined to harbour, by the badne&s;s of the weather. The &s;ame rea&s;on has cau&s;ed great delay in building of our barracks; which, with a mo&s;t mortifying &s;carcity of fire-wood, di&s;courages the men from enli&s;ting.

<P>I HAD the honour of writing to you on the nine|teenth in&s;tant. I have now to inform you that Henry Knox, e&s;quire, is gone to New-York, with orders to for|ward to this place what cannon and ordnance &s;tores can be there procured. From thence he will proceed to gen|eral

Schuyler on the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s, as you will &s;ee by the inclo&s;ed copy of in&s;tructions which I have given him. It would give me much &s;atisfaction, that this gentleman, or any other whom you may think qualified, was appointed to the command of the artillery regiment. In my letter to you, of the eighth in&s;tant, I have expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf fully on this &s;ubject, which I beg leave to recommend to your immediate attention; as the formation of that corps will be at a &s;tand, until I am honoured with your in&s;tructions thereon. * * * *</P>
<P>There are two per&s;ons engaged to go to Nova-Scotia, on the bu&s;ine&s;s recommended in your la&s;t. By the be&s;t information we have from thence, the &s;tores, &amp;c. have been withdrawn &s;ome time. Should this not be the ca&s;e, it is next to an impo&s;&s;ibility to attempt any thing there, in the pre&s;ent un&s;ettled and precarious &s;tate of the army. * * *</P>
<P>From what I can collect by my inquiries among&s;t the officers, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to get the men to enli&s;t for the continuance of the war; which will be an in&s;uperable ob&s;truction to the formation of the two battalions of ma|rines on the plan re&s;olved on in Congre&s;s. As it can make no difference, I propo&s;e to proceed on the new ar|rangement of the army, and, when completed, inquire out &s;uch officers and men as are be&s;t qualified for that &s;ervice, and endeavour to form the&s;e two battalions out of the whole. This appears to me the be&s;t method, and will, I hope, meet the approbation of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>As it will be very difficult for the men to work when the hard fro&s;t &s;ets in, I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary (though of little u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e at pre&s;ent) to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Coble-hill, for the benefit of any future operations. It was effected, without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition from the enemy, the twenty|third in&s;tant. Their inactivity on this occa&s;ion is what I cannot account for;&mdash;it is probable they are meditating a blow &s;omewhere.</P>
<P>About three hundred men, women and children of the poor inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, came out to Point-Shir|ley la&s;t Friday. They have brought their hou&s;ehold fur|niture, but are unprovided of every other nece&s;&s;ary of life. I have recommended them to the attention of the
<PB N="55" REF="029737_0054_0FE247371ED72828">
committee of the honourable council of this province, now &s;itting at Watertown.</P>
<P>The number enli&s;ted &s;ince my la&s;t are two thou&s;and four hundred and fifty men. * * * * Our &s;ituation is truly alarming: and of this general Howe is well appri&s;ed, it being the common topic of conver&s;ation when the people left Bo&s;ton la&s;t Friday. No doubt, when he is reinforced; he will avail him&s;elf of the information.</P>
<P>I am making the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition I can for our defence, having thrown up, be&s;ides the work on Coble-hill, &s;everal redoubts, half-moons, &amp;c. along the bay: and I fear I &s;hall be under the nece&s;&s;ity of calling in the militia and minute-men of the country to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance: I &s;ay, I fear it,&mdash;becau&s;e, by what I can learn from the officers in the army, belonging to this colony, it will be next to an im|po&s;&s;ibility to keep them under any degree of di&s;cipline, and that it will be very difficult to prevail on them to re|main a moment longer than they choo&s;e them&s;elves. It is a mortifying reflection, to be reduced to this dilemma. There has been nothing wanting on my part, to infu&s;e a proper &s;pirit among&s;t the officers, that they may exert their influence with the &s;oldiery. You &s;ee, by a fortnight's recruiting among&s;t men with arms in their hands, how little has been the &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>As the &s;mall-pox is now in Bo&s;ton, I have u&s;ed the precaution of prohibiting &s;uch as lately came out from coming near our camp. General Burgoyne, I am inform|ed, will &s;oon embark for England. I think the ri&s;k too great to write you by po&s;t, whil&s;t it continues to pa&s;s through New-York. It is certain that a po&s;t has been in|tercepted the beginning of la&s;t month, as they &s;ent out &s;everal letters from Bo&s;ton with the po&s;t-mark of Balti|more on them. This goes by captain Jo&s;eph Blewer, who promi&s;es to deliver it carefully unto you.</P>
<P>You doubtle&s;s will have heard, before this reaches, of general Montgomery's having got po&s;s;e&s;s;ion of Mon|tr&eacute;al. I congratulate you thereon. He has troubles with his troops, as well as I have. All I can learn of colonel&punc; Arnold is, that he is near Quebec. I hope Montgomery will be able to proceed to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour of writing to you the thirtieth ultimo, inclo&s;ing an inventory of the military &s;tores taken on board the brig Nancy by captain Manly of the armed &s;chooner Lee. I have now to inform you that he has &s;ince &s;ent into Beverly a &s;hip named the Concord, James Lowrie, ma&s;ter, from Greenock in Scotland, bound to Bo&s;ton. She has on board dry goods and coals, to the value of three thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ix pounds, nine &s;hillings and &s;even pence &s;terling, &s;hipped by Crawford, Ander&s;on, and Co. and con&s;igned to James Ander&s;on, merchant in Bo&s;ton. It is mentioned in the letters found
<PB N="57" REF="029737_0056_0FE24738A42A3590">
on board, that this cargo was for the u&s;e of the army: but, on a &s;trict examination, I find it is really the property of the &s;hippers and the per&s;on to whom con&s;igned. Pray what is to be done with this &s;hip and cargo? and what with the brigantine which brought the military &s;tores?&mdash;It was agreed, in the conference la&s;t October, <HI>"that all ve&s;&s;els employed merely as tran&s;ports, and unarmed, with their crews, be &s;et at liberty, upon giving &s;ecurity to return to Europe; but that this indulgence be not extended longer than till the fir&s;t of April next."</HI> In the &s;hippers' letter, they mention: "You mu&s;t procure a certificate from the general and admiral, of the Concord's being in the government &s;ervice, &s;uch as the Gla&s;gow packet brought with her, which was of great &s;er|vice, procured a liberty to arm her, which was refu&s;ed us; al&s;o gave her a preference for &s;ome recruits that went out in her." In another part of the letter, they &s;ay: "Cap|tain Lowrie will deliver you the contract for the coals: we gave it to him, as it perhaps might be of u&s;e, as a certificate of his &s;hip being employed in the government &s;ervice." Every letter on board breathes nothing but enmity to this country: and a va&s;t number of them there are.</P>
<P>It is &s;ome time &s;ince I recommended to the Congre&s;s that they would in&s;titute a court for the trial of prizes made by the continental armed ve&s;&s;els; which I hope they have ere now taken into their con&s;ideration: otherwi&s;e I &s;hould again take the liberty of urging it in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing manner.</P>
<P>The conduct of a great number of the Connecticut troops has laid me under the nece&s;&s;ity of calling in a body of the militia, much &s;ooner than I apprehended there would be an occa&s;ion for &s;uch a &s;tep. I was afraid &s;ome time ago that they would incline to go home, when the time of their en|li&s;tment expired. I called upon the officers of the &s;everal regiments, to know whether they could prevail on the men to remain until the fir&s;t of January, or till a &s;ufficient number of other forces could be rai&s;ed to &s;upply their place. I &s;uppo&s;e they were deceived them&s;elves: I know they deceived me by a&s;&s;urances that I need be under no apprehen&s;ion on that &s;core, for the men would not leave the lines. La&s;t Friday &s;hewed how much they were mi&s;|taken, as the major part of the troops of that colony were
<PB N="58" REF="029737_0057_0FE246E68039E838">
going away with their arms and ammunition. We have however by threats, per&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;ion, and the activity of the peo|ple of the country who &s;ent back many of them that had &s;et out, prevailed upon the mo&s;t part to &s;tay. There are about eighty of them mi&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>I have called in three thou&s;and men from this province; and general Sullivan, who lately returned from the prov|ince of New-Hamp&s;hire, having informed me that a num|ber of men were there ready at the &s;horte&s;t notice, I have demanded two thou&s;and from that province. The&s;e two bodies, I expect, will be in by the tenth in&s;tant, to make up the deficiency of the Connecticut-men whom I have promi&s;ed to di&s;mi&s;s on that day, as well as the numbers to whom I was obliged to grant furloughs before any would enli&s;t. As the &s;ame defection is much to be ap|prehended when the time of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, New-Hamp&s;hire, and Rhode-I&s;land forces is expired, I beg the attention of Congre&s;s to this important affair.</P>
<P>I am informed that it has been the cu&s;tom of the&s;e prov|inces in the la&s;t war, for the legi&s;lative power to order ev|ery town to provide a certain quota of men for the cam|paign. This or &s;ome other mode &s;hould be at pre&s;ent adopted, as I am &s;atisfied the men cannot be had without. This the Congre&s;s will plea&s;e to take into their immediate con&s;ideration. My &s;u&s;picions on this head I &s;hall al&s;o communicate to the governors Trumbull and Cooke, al&s;o to the New-Hamp&s;hire convention.</P>
<P>The number enli&s;ted in the la&s;t week are about thirteen hundred men. By this you &s;ee how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">low this important work goes on. * * *</P>
<P>An expre&s;s is ju&s;t come in from general Schuyler, with letters from colonel Arnold and general Montgomery, copies of which I have the honour to inclo&s;e you. Upon the whole, I think affairs carry a plea&s;ing a&s;pect in that quarter. The reduction of Quebec is an object of &s;uch great importance, that I doubt not the Congre&s;s will give every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power for the accompli&s;hing it this winter.</P>
<P>By the la&s;t accounts from the armed &s;chooners &s;ent to the river St. Laurence, I fear we have but little to expect from them: they were falling &s;hort of provi&s;ion, and men|tion
<PB N="59" REF="029737_0058_0FE247428A3F4E68">
that they would be obliged to return; which at this time is particularly unfortunate, as, if they cho&s;e a proper &s;tation, all the ve&s;&s;els coming down that river mu&s;t fall into their hands. The plague, trouble and vexation I have had with the crews of all the armed ve&s;&s;els, is inexpre&s;&s;ible. I do believe there is not on earth a more di&s;orderly &s;et: ev|ery time they come into port, we hear of nothing but mutinous complaints. Manly's &s;ucce&s;s has lately, and but lately, quieted his people. The crews of the Wa&s;hington and Harri&s;on have actually de&s;erted them; &s;o that I have been under the nece&s;&s;ity of ordering the agent to lay the latter up, and get hands for the other on the be&s;t terms he could.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives and the honourable board have &s;ent me a vote of theirs relative to the harbour of Cape-Cod, which you have herewith. I &s;hall &s;end an offi|cer thither to examine what can be done for its defence, though I do not think I &s;hall be able to give them &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as may be requi&s;ite; for I have at pre&s;ent neither men, powder, nor cannon to &s;pare. The great want of powder is what the attention of Congre&s;s &s;hould be partic|ularly applied to. I dare not attempt any thing offen&s;ive, let the temptation or advantage be ever &s;o great, as I have not more of that mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential article than will be ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to defend our lines, &s;hould the enemy at|tempt to attack them.</P>
<P>By recent information from Bo&s;ton, general Howe is go|ing to &s;end out a number of the inhabitants, in order, it is thought, to make more room for his expected reinforce|ments. There is one part of the information I can hardly give credit to:&mdash;a &s;ailor &s;ays that a number of tho&s;e com|ing out have been inoculated, with de&s;ign of &s;preading the &s;mall-pox through this country and camp. I have communicated this to the general court; and recommend|ed their attention thereto.</P>
<P>They are arming one of the tran&s;ports in Bo&s;ton, with which they mean to decoy &s;ome of our armed ve&s;&s;els. As we are appri&s;ed of their de&s;ign, I hope they will be di&s;appointed.</P>

A letter to the &s;ame purport I &s;ent to the legi&s;lature of this province.</P>
<P>The militia are coming in fa&s;t. I am much plea&s;ed with the alacrity which the good people of this province, as well as tho&s;e of New-Hamp&s;hire, have &s;hewn upon this occa&s;ion.

<P>The commi&s;&s;ary-general is &s;till by his indi&s;po&s;ition de|tained from camp. He committed an error, when mak|ing out the ration-li&s;t: for he was then &s;erving out (and has continued &s;o to do) &s;ix ounces per man per week of butter, though it is not included in the li&s;t approved of by Congre&s;s. I do not think it would be expedient to put a &s;top thereto; as every thing, that would have a tendency to give the &s;oldiery room for complaint, mu&s;t be avoided.</P>
<P>The information I received that the enemy intended &s;preading the &s;mall-pox among&s;t us, I could not &s;uppo&s;e them capable of.

Every nece&s;&s;ary precaution has been taken to prevent its being communicated to this ar|my; and the general court will take care that it does not &s;pread through the country.</P>
<P>I have not heard that any more troops are arrived at Bo&s;ton; which is a lucky circum&s;tance, as the Connecticut troops, I now find, are for the mo&s;t part gone off. The hou&s;es in Bo&s;ton are le&s;&s;ening every day: they are pulled down, either for fire-wood, or to prevent the effects of fire, &s;hould we attempt a bombardment or an attack upon the town.

<P>I RECEIVED your favour of the &s;econd in&s;tant, with the &s;everal re&s;olves of Congre&s;s therein inclo&s;ed. The re|&s;olves relative to captures made by continental armed ve&s;|&s;els only want a court e&s;tabli&s;hed for trial, to make them complete. This, I hope, will be &s;oon done, as I have taken the liberty to urge it often to the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>I am &s;omewhat at a lo&s;s to know whether I am to rai&s;e the two battalions of marines here, or not. As the delay can be attended with but little inconvenience, I will wait a farther explanation from Congre&s;s, before I take any &s;teps therein.</P>
<P>I am much plea&s;ed that the money will be forwarded with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, as it is much wanting; al&s;o that Conolly and his a&s;&s;ociates are taken. It has been a very fortunate di&s;covery. I make no doubt but that the Congre&s;s will take every nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s lord Dunmore of his hold in Virginia: the &s;ooner &s;teps are taken for that purpo&s;e, the more probability there will be of their being effectual. * * * *</P>
<P>I will make application to general Howe, and propo&s;e an exchange for Mr. Ethan Allen. I am much afraid I &s;hall have a like propo&s;al to make for captain Martindale, of the armed brigantine Wa&s;hington, and his men, which, it is reported, was taken a few days pa&s;t by a man-of-war, and carried into Bo&s;ton. We cannot expect to be always &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>

<P>About a hundred and fifty more of the poor inhabit|ants are come out of Bo&s;ton. The &s;mall-pox rages all over the town: &s;uch of the military as had it not before are now under inoculation.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS OF THE DAY.</HEAD>
<P>LAST evening, eight men came in a boat from Bo&s;ton, to our guard at the ferry,&mdash;&s;ix of them captains of ve&s;&s;els. They brought the following account:</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday, one large mortar was carried over to Bun|ker's hill:&mdash;the troops filling water, carrying it on board the tran&s;ports:&mdash;provi&s;ions &s;carce,&mdash;not more than &s;uf|ficient for &s;ix weeks.

<P>CAPTAIN Manly, of the Lee armed &s;chooner, took and &s;ent into Beverly the &s;loop Bet&s;ey, A. Atkin&s;on, ma&s;ter. She is an armed ve&s;&s;el, di&s;patched by lord Dun|more, with Indian corn, potatoes, and oats, for the army in Bo&s;ton. The packets of letters found on board, I have the honour to &s;end you with this by captain James Chambers, they being of &s;o much importance that I do not think it would be prudent to tru&s;t them by a common expre&s;s.</P>
<P>As lord Dunmore's &s;chemes are fully laid open in the&s;e letters, I need not point out to the Congre&s;s the nece&s;&s;ity there is of a vigorous exertion being adopted by them, to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s his lord&s;hip of the &s;trong hold he has got in Virginia. I do not mean to dictate: but I am &s;ure they will pardon me for giving them freely my opin|ion, which is, that the fate of America a good deal de|pends on his being obliged to evacuate Norfolk this win|ter, or not.</P>
<P>I have Kirkland well &s;ecured, and think I will &s;end him to you for examination. By mo&s;t of the letters relative to him, he is a dangerous fellow. John Stewart's letters and papers are of a very intere&s;ting nature. Gov|ernor Tonyn's and many other letters from Augu&s;tine &s;hew the weakne&s;s of the place; at the &s;ame time, of what va&s;t con&s;equence it would be for us to po&s;&s;e&s;s our|&s;elves of it, and the great quantity of ammunition con|tained in the forts. Indeed the&s;e papers are of &s;o great con&s;equence, that I think this but little inferior to any prize our famous Manly has taken.</P>
<P>We now work at our ea&s;e on Leechmore's hill. On di&s;covering our party there ye&s;terday morning, the &s;hip which lay oppo&s;ite began a cannonade, to which Mount Horam added &s;ome &s;hells. One of our men was wound|ed. We fired a few &s;hot from two eighteen pounders which are placed on Coble-hill, and &s;oon obliged the &s;hip to &s;hift her &s;tation. She now lies in the ferry-way: and, except a few &s;hells from the mount in Bo&s;ton, (which do no execution) we have no interruption in pro&s;ecuting our works. which will in a very &s;hort time be completed.
<PB N="65" REF="029737_0064_0FE247488E026D00">
When that is done,&mdash;when we have powder to &s;port with,&mdash;I think, if the Congre&s;s re&s;olve on the execution of the propo&s;al made relative to the town of Bo&s;ton, it can be done.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent a letter in this day to general Howe, of which a copy goes herewith. My rea&s;on for pointing out brigadier-general Pre&s;cot as the object who is to &s;uffer Mr. Allen's fate, is, that, by letters from general Schuy|ler, and copies of letters from general Montgomery to Schuyler, I am given to under&s;tand that Pre&s;cot is the cau&s;e of Allen's &s;ufferings. I thought it be&s;t to be deci|&s;ive on the occa&s;ion, as did the generals whom I con&s;ulted thereon.</P>
<P>The returns of men enli&s;ted &s;ince my la&s;t amount to about eighteen hundred, making in the whole &s;even thou|&s;and one hundred and forty. The militia that are come in, both from this province and New-Hamp&s;hire, are very fine-looking men, and go through their duty with great alacrity. The di&s;patch made, both by the people in march|ing and by the legi&s;lative powers in complying with my requi&s;ition, has given me infinite &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Your letter of the eighth in&s;tant, with the explanatory re&s;olve re&s;pecting my calling forth the militia and minute|men, is come to hand; to which I &s;hall pay all due atten|tion. You have removed all the difficulties which I labour|ed under, about the two battalions of marines. I &s;hall obey the orders of Congre&s;s in looking out for proper offi|cers to command that corps. I make no doubt but, when the money arrives to pay off the arrears and the month's ad|vance, that it will be a great encouragement for the men to enli&s;t.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed is a letter I lately received from Mr. James Lovell. His ca&s;e is truly pitiable. I wi&s;h &s;ome mode could be fallen upon to relieve him from the cruel &s;ituation he is now in. I am &s;en&s;ible of the impropriety of exchang|ing a &s;oldier for a citizen: but there is &s;omething &s;o cru|elly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing in regard to this gentleman, that I dare &s;ay you will take it under your con&s;ideration.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour to addre&s;s my&s;elf to you on the nineteenth in&s;tant, &s;ince which I have received endoubted information that the genuine in&s;tructions given to Conolly have not reached your hands; that they are very artfully concealed in the tree of his &s;addle, and covered with can|va&s;s &s;o nicely that they are &s;carcely di&s;cernible: that tho&s;e which were found upon him were intended to deceive, if he was caught. You will mo&s;t certainly have his &s;addle taken to pieces, in order to di&s;cover this deep-laid plot.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed is a copy of general Howe's letter in an&s;wer to the one I wrote him the eighteenth in&s;tant. The con|duct I am to ob&s;erve towards brigadier Pre&s;cot in con&s;e|quence of the&s;e letters, the Congre&s;s will oblige me by determining for me.</P>
<P>The gentlemen by whom you &s;ent the money are arriv|ed. The &s;um they brought, though large, is not &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the demands of the army, which at this time are remarkably heavy: there is three month's pay due, one month's advance, two dollars for each blanket,&mdash;the arms, that are left by tho&s;e who are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, to be paid for,&mdash;be&s;ides the demands which are on the commi&s;&s;ary and quarter-ma&s;ter generals. You will therefore &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of another remittance, which I beg may be as &s;oon as you conveniently can.</P>
<P>I will take the opportunity of the return of the&s;e gen|tlemen, to &s;end colonel Kirkland to you for examination, and that you may di&s;po&s;e of him as to you may &s;eem proper.</P>
<P>A committee from the general court of this province called on me the other day, informing me that they were in great want of ordnance for the defence of the colony; that, if what belonged to them, now in u&s;e here, was kept for the continent, they would be under the nece&s;&s;ity of providing them&s;elves with others: of cour&s;e what is kept mu&s;t be paid for. There are many of the cannon of very little u&s;e: &s;uch of them as are good, I cannot at pre&s;ent part with: perhaps when I receive the &s;upply

from New-York and Canada, it may be in my power to &s;pare them.</P>
<P>Mr. Wad&s;worth has &s;ent in his report re&s;pecting Cape-Cod harbour, a copy of which you will receive herewith; al&s;o a letter from a Mr. Jacob Bailey, put into my hands by colonel Little. It contains &s;ome things that may not be unworthy the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>We have made good progre&s;s in the works on Leech|more's point. They would have been fini&s;hed ere this, but for the &s;everity of the weather, which prevents our people from working.</P>
<P>I received a letter from governor Cooke, which expre&s;&s;|es the fears of the people of Rhode-I&s;land, le&s;t the &s;hips, which we had information were &s;ailed, with &s;ome troops on board, were de&s;tined for Newport.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WROTE to you the twenty-fifth in&s;tant; &s;ince which I am not honoured with any of your favours. The e&s;timate I then inclo&s;ed you was calculated to pay the troops, &amp;c. up to the fir&s;t of January. That cannot be done for want of funds in the pay-ma&s;ter-general's hands; which cau&s;es a great murmuring among&s;t tho&s;e who are going off. The monthly expenies of this army amount to near two hundred and &s;eventy-five thou&s;and dollars, which I take the liberty of recommending to the ob&s;ervation of Congre&s;s, that their future remittances may be governed thereby.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="029737_0067_0FE246FB8B44A8A8">
It &s;ometimes happens that per&s;ons would wi&s;h to depo&s;it money in the hands of the pay-ma&s;ter-general, for his bills on the trea&s;ury at Philadelphia. He has hitherto declined &s;uch offers, not having authority from Congre&s;s to draw. Would it not be proper to give this power? If it &s;hould be approved of, you will plea&s;e to point out the mode that the Congre&s;s would choo&s;e to have it done in.</P>
<P>The clothing &s;ent to the quarter-ma&s;ter-general is not &s;ufficient to put half our army into regimentals; nor is there a po&s;&s;ibility of getting any quantity here. I have wrote to general Schuyler, that I wi&s;h what was lodged at Albany could be &s;pared for the&s;e troops, as general Mont|gomery would clothe the men under his command at Montr&eacute;al. If this can be done, it will be of infinite &s;er|vice; and no time &s;hould be lo&s;t in forwarding them to this camp.</P>
<P>In forming the regiments for the new e&s;tabli&s;hment, I thought it but ju&s;tice to appoint the officers, detached under colonel Arnold, to commi&s;&s;ions in them. Their ab&s;ence at pre&s;ent is of very great detriment to the &s;ervice, e&s;pecially in recruiting: I would therefore wi&s;h, if the Congre&s;s intend rai&s;ing troops in or for Canada, that they could be taken in there. The &s;ooner I have their opin|ion of this matter, the better, that, if they can be com|mi&s;&s;ioned in Canada, I may appoint officers here to replace them.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed you have a copy of a repre&s;entation &s;ent to me by the legi&s;lative body of this province, re&s;pecting four companies &s;tationed at Braintree, Weymouth, and Hingham. As they were never regimented, and were doing duty at a di&s;tance from the re&s;t of the army, I did not know whether to con&s;ider them as a part of it; nor do I think my&s;elf authori&s;ed to direct payment for them with|out the approbation of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>It has been repre&s;ented to me that the free negroes who have &s;erved in this army are very much di&s;&s;atisfied at be|ing di&s;carded. As it is to be apprehended that they may &s;eek employ in the mini&s;terial army, I have pre&s;umed to depart from the re&s;olution re&s;pecting them, and have given licen&s;e for their being enli&s;ted. If this is di&s;approv|ed of by Congre&s;s, I will put a &s;top to it.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="029737_0068_0FE2475111CB9A60">
* * * I mu&s;t remark that the pay of the a&s;&s;i&s;tant en|gineers is &s;o very &s;mall, that we cannot expect men of &s;cience will engage in it. Tho&s;e gentlemen, who are in that &s;tation, remained under the expectation that an addi|tional allowance would be made them by the re&s;pective provinces in which they were appointed, to that allowed by the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Captain Freeman arrived this day at camp from Canada. He left Quebec the twenty-fourth ultimo, in con&s;equence of general Carleton's proclamation which I have the hon|our to &s;end you herewith. He &s;aw colonel Arnold the twenty-&s;ixth, and &s;ays that he was joined at Point-&agrave;-trem|ble by general Montgomery, the fir&s;t in&s;tant;&mdash;that they were about two thou&s;and &s;trong, and were making every preparation for attacking Quebec;&mdash;that general Carleton had with him about twelve hundred men, the majority of whom are &s;ailors;&mdash;that it was his opinion the French would give up the place if they get the &s;ame conditions granted to the inhabitants of Montr&eacute;al. * * *</P>
<P>Captains Semple and Harbe&s;on take under their care Mr. Kirkland. * * * Captain Mathews and Mr. Rob|in&s;on will accompany them. The two latter were taken pri&s;oners by lord Dunmore, who was &s;ending them to Bo&s;ton, from whence there is little doubt but they would be forwarded to England, to which place I am credibly informed captain Martindale and the crew of the Wa&s;h|ington are &s;ent; al&s;o colonel Allen, and the pri&s;oners tak|en with him in Canada. This may account for general Howe's &s;ilence on the &s;ubject of an exchange of pri&s;oners mentioned in my letter to him.</P>
<P>General Lee is ju&s;t returned from his excur&s;ion to Rhode-I&s;land:&mdash;he has pointed out the be&s;t method the i&s;land would admit of for its defence: he has endeavoured all in his power to make friends of tho&s;e that were our en|emies. You have, inclo&s;ed, a &s;pecimen of his abilities in that way, for your peru&s;al. I am of opinion that, if the &s;ame plan was pur&s;ued through every province, it would have a very good effect.</P>
<P>I have long had it on my mind to mention to Congre&s;s, that frequent applications had been made to me re&s;pecting the chaplains' pay, which is too &s;mall to encourage men
<PB N="70" REF="029737_0069_0FE246FE18F32178">
of abilities. Some of them, who have left their flocks, are obliged to pay the par&s;on acting for them more than they receive. I need not point out the great utility of gentlemen who&s;e lives and conver&s;ation are unexceptiona|ble, being employed for that &s;ervice in this army. There are two ways of making it worth the attention of &s;uch: one is an advancement of their pay; the other, that one chaplain be appointed to two regiments. This la&s;t, I think, may be done without inconvenience. I beg leave to recommend this matter to Congre&s;s, who&s;e &s;entiments hereon I &s;hall impatiently expect.</P>
<P>Upon a farther conver&s;ation with captain Freeman, he is of opinion that general Montgomery has with him near three thou&s;and men, including colonel Arnold's. He &s;ays that lord Pit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> had received repeated orders from his father to return home; in con&s;equence of which, he had embarked, &s;ome time in October, with a captain Green who was ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el belonging to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>By a number of &s;alutes in Bo&s;ton harbour ye&s;terday, I fancy admiral Shuldha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> is arrived. Two large &s;hips were &s;een coming in.</P>
<P>Our enli&s;tments now amount to nine thou&s;and &s;ix hun|dred and fifty.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e gentlemen who were made pri&s;oners by lord Dunmore, being left de&s;titute of money and nece&s;&s;aries, I have advanced them a hundred pounds lawful-money be|longing to the public, for which I have taken captain Ma|thews's draught on the trea&s;ury of Virginia, which goes inclo&s;ed.</P>

to be put in execution the fir&s;t moment I &s;ee a proba|bility of &s;ucce&s;s, and in &s;uch a way as a council of officers &s;hall think mo&s;t likely to produce it: but if this &s;hould not happen as &s;oon as you may expect or my wi&s;hes prompt to, I reque&s;t that Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to advert to my &s;ituation, and do me the ju&s;tice to believe, that circum|&s;tances, and not want of inclination, are the cau&s;e of delay.</P>
<P>It is not in the pages of hi&s;tory perhaps to furni&s;h a ca&s;e like ours:&mdash;to maintain a po&s;t within mu&s;ket-&s;hot of the enemy, for &s;ix months together, without<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Left blank in the original to guard again&s;t the danger of mi&s;carriage.

But if we &s;uc|ceed as well in the la&s;t, as we have heretofore in the fir&s;t, I &s;hall think it the mo&s;t fortunate event of my whole life.</P>
<P>By a very intelligent gentleman, a Mr. Hutchin&s;on, from Bo&s;ton, I learn, that it was admiral Shuldham that came into the harbour on Saturday la&s;t; that two of the five regiments from Cork are arrived at Halifax; two others have &s;ailed for Quebec; but what was become of them could not be told:&mdash;and the other (the fifty-fifth) has ju&s;t got into Bo&s;ton. Certain it is al&s;o, that the greate&s;t part of the &s;eventeenth regiment is arrived there. Whether we are to conclude from hence that more than five regiments have been &s;ent out, or that the com|panies of the &s;eventeenth, arrived at Bo&s;ton, are part of the regiments de&s;tined for Halifax and Quebec, I know not.</P>
<P>We al&s;o learn from this gentleman and others, that the troops, embarked for Halifax (as mentioned in my letter of the &s;ixteenth) were really de&s;igned for that place, but recalled from Nanta&s;ket road, upon advice being received of the above regiments there. I am al&s;o informed of a fleet now getting ready under the convoy of the Scarbo|rough and Fowey men-of-war,&mdash;con&s;i&s;ting of five tran&s;|ports and two bomb ve&s;&s;els, with about three hundred marines, and &s;everal flat-bottomed boats. It is whi&s;pered that they are de&s;igned for Newport, but generally thought
<PB N="72" REF="029737_0071_0FE246FF9ED829F8">
in Bo&s;ton that it is meant for Long-I&s;land: and it is probable it will be followed by more troops, as the other tran&s;ports are taking in water,&mdash;to lie, as others &s;ay, in Nanta&s;ket road, to be out of the ice. A large quantity of bi&s;cuit is al&s;o baking.</P>
<P>As the real de&s;ign cannot with certainty be known, I &s;ubmit it, with all due deference, to the &s;uperior judgment of Congre&s;s, whether it would not be con&s;i&s;tent with pru|dence to have &s;ome of the Jer&s;ey troops thrown into New-York, to prevent an evil which would be almo&s;t irremedia|ble, &s;hould it happen,&mdash;I mean, the landing of troops at that place, or upon Long-I&s;land near it.</P>
<P>As it is po&s;&s;ible you may not yet have received his maj|e&s;ty's <HI>"mo&s;t gracious"</HI> &s;peech, I do my&s;elf the honour to inclo&s;e one of many, which were &s;ent out of Bo&s;ton ye&s;ter|day.

<P>EVERY account I have out of Bo&s;ton confirms the embarkation of troops mentioned in my la&s;t, which, from the &s;ea&s;on of the year and other circum&s;tances, mu&s;t be de&s;tined for &s;ome expedition to the &s;outhward of this. I have therefore thought it prudent to &s;end major-general Lee to New-York. I have given him letters recommen|datory to governor Trumbull, and to the committee of &s;afety at New-York. I have good hopes that in Connec|ticut he will get many volunteers, who (I have &s;ome rea|&s;on to think) will accompany him on this expedition, without more expen&s;e to the continent than their mainte|nance. But &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e, and that they &s;hould expect pay, I think it is a trifling con&s;ideration, when put

<P>I AM exceedingly &s;orry that I am under the nece&s;|&s;ity of applying to you, and calling the attention of Con|gre&s;s to the &s;tate of our arms, which is truly alarming.
<PB N="74" REF="029737_0073_0FE24701236FDE70">
Upon the di&s;&s;olution of the old army, I was apprehen&s;ive that the new would be deficient in this in&s;tance: and, that the want might be as incon&s;iderable as po&s;&s;ible, I gave it out in orders, that the arms of &s;uch men as did not re-enli&s;t (or &s;uch of them as were good) &s;hould be retained at the prices which &s;hould be affixed by per&s;ons appointed to in|&s;pect and value them: and, that we might be &s;ure of them, I added that there would be a &s;toppage of pay for the months of November and December, from tho&s;e who &s;hould carry their firelocks away without their being fir&s;t examined. I hoped, by the&s;e precautions, to have procured a con&s;ider|able number: but, Sir, I find with much concern, that, from the badne&s;s of the arms, and the di&s;obedience of too many in bearing them off without a previous in&s;pection,&mdash;very few were collected. Neither are we to expect that many will be brought in by the new recruits,&mdash;the officers, who are out enli&s;ting, having reported that few men who have arms will engage in the &s;ervice; and that they are under the di&s;agreeable alternative of taking men without arms, or of getting none. Unhappy &s;ituation, and much to be deplored!&mdash;e&s;pecially when we have every rea&s;on to convince us, that we have to contend with a formidable army, well provided of every nece&s;&s;ary; and that there will be a mo&s;t vigorous exertion of mini&s;terial vengeance again&s;t us, as &s;oon as they think them&s;elves in a condition for it. I hope it is in the power of Congre&s;s to afford us relief:&mdash;if it is not, what mu&s;t, what can be done?</P>
<P>Our trea&s;ury is almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, and the demands again&s;t it very con&s;iderable. A con&s;tant &s;upply of money, to an&s;wer every claim and exigency, would much promote the good of the &s;ervice. In the common affairs of life, it is u&s;eful: in war, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential. I would beg leave, too, to remind you of the tents, and of their importance,&mdash;hoping that, if an opportunity has offered, you have procured them. I fear that our army will not be rai&s;ed to the new e&s;tabli&s;hment in any rea&s;ona|ble time, if ever: the enli&s;ting goes on &s;o very &s;low, that it almo&s;t &s;eems at an end.</P>
<P>In my letter of the fourth in&s;tant, I wrote you that I had received certain intelligence from a Mr. Hutchin&s;on and others, that two of the five regiments from Cork were
<PB N="75" REF="029737_0074_0FE2475CE3F15AE0">
arrived at Halifax, one at Bo&s;ton, and the two others had &s;ailed for Quebec, and had not been heard of. I am new a&s;&s;ured (as a matter to be relied on) by four captains of &s;hips, who left England about the &s;econd of November, and who appear to be men of veracity, that the whole of the&s;e regiments, (except the two companies that arriv|ed at Bo&s;ton &s;ome time ago) when they &s;ailed, were at Milford Haven, where they had been obliged to put in, by a violent &s;torm, the nineteenth of October; that they would not be able to leave it for a con&s;iderable time, as they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of repairing their ve&s;&s;els, and getting &s;ome new ones taken up. Such is the un|certainty and contradiction in what I now hear, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to know what to believe or di&s;believe.</P>
<P>I wrote to the general court ye&s;terday, and to the con|vention of New-Hamp&s;hire, immediately upon &s;eeing the great deficiency in our arms,&mdash;praying that they would in|tere&s;t them&s;elves in the matter, and furni&s;h me with all in their power. Whether I &s;hall get any, or what quantity, I cannot determine, not having received their an&s;wers. The &s;ame application will be made to the governments of Con|necticut and Rhode-I&s;land.</P>
<P>I do my&s;elf the honour to &s;end you &s;undry new&s;papers I received from the above-mentioned captains, as they may be later than any you have &s;een, and contain &s;ome intere&s;t|ing intelligence.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TAKING it for granted that general Schuyler has not only informed you of the fall of the brave and much-to-be-lamented general Montgomery, but of the &s;ituation of our affairs in Canada, (as related by general Woo&s;ter, colonel Arnold, colonel Campbell, and others) I &s;hall not take up much more of your time on this &s;ubject, than is nece&s;&s;ary to inclo&s;e you a copy of his letter to me, with the re&s;ult thereon, as appears by the council of war, which I immediately &s;ummoned on the occa&s;ion, and at
<PB N="76" REF="029737_0075_0FE2470B070A2B78">
which Mr. Adams, by my particular de&s;ire, was good enough to attend.</P>
<P>It may appear &s;trange, Sir, as I had not men to &s;pare from the&s;e lines, that I &s;hould pre&s;ume (without fir&s;t &s;ending to Congre&s;s, and obtaining an expre&s;s direction) to recommend to the governments of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Con|necticut and New-Hamp&s;hire, to rai&s;e each a regiment, on the continental account, for this &s;ervice. I wi&s;h mo&s;t ar|dently that the urgency of the ca&s;e would have admitted of the delay. I wi&s;h al&s;o that the purport of general Schuy|ler's letter had not, unavoidably as it were, laid me under an indi&s;pen&s;able obligation to do it:&mdash;for having informed you in his letter (a copy of which he inclo&s;ed me) of his dependence on this quarter, for men, I thought you might al&s;o have &s;ome reliance on my exertions. This con&s;ideration, added to my fears of the fatal con&s;equences of delay,&mdash;to an information of your having de&s;igned three thou&s;and men for Canada,&mdash;to a belief, founded chiefly on general Schuyler's letters, that few or none of them were rai&s;ed,&mdash;and to my apprehen&s;ions for New-York, which led me to think that no troops could be &s;pared from that quarter,&mdash;induced me to lo&s;e not a moment's time in throwing in a force there; being well a&s;&s;ured that general Carleton will improve to the utmo&s;t the advantages gained, leaving no artifices untried, to fix the Canadians and In|dians (who, we find, are too well di&s;po&s;ed to take part with the &s;tronge&s;t) in his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>If the&s;e rea&s;ons are not &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify my conduct in the opinion of Congre&s;s,&mdash;if the mea&s;ure contravenes any re&s;olution of theirs, they will plea&s;e to countermand the levying and marching of the regiments as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible, and do me the ju&s;tice to believe that my intentions were good, if my judgment has erred.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s will plea&s;e al&s;o to ob&s;erve, that the mea&s;|ure of &s;upporting our po&s;ts in Canada appeared of &s;uch ex|ceeding great importance, that the general officers (agree|ing with me in &s;entiment, and unwilling to lay any burden which can po&s;&s;ibly be avoided,&mdash;although it may turn out an ill-timed piece of par&s;imony) have re&s;olved that the three regiments for Canada &s;hall be part of the thirteen militia regiments which were reque&s;ted to reinforce this

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE commi&s;&s;ary-general being at length [<HI>recovered</HI>] from along and painful illne&s;s, I have it in my power to comply with the requi&s;ition of Congre&s;s, in forwarding an e&s;timate of the expen&s;e attending his office, as al&s;o that of the quarter-ma&s;ter-general.</P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve that the commi&s;&s;ary, by his account of the matter, has entered into no &s;pecial agree|ment with any of the per&s;ons he has found occa&s;ion to em|ploy, (as tho&s;e, to who&s;e names &s;ums are annexed, are of their own fixing) but left it to Congre&s;s to a&s;certain their wages. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing therefore on this head, farther than relates to the propo&s;ition of Mr. * * *, to be allow|ed one eighth for his trouble and the delivery of the other &s;even eighths of provi&s;ions, which to me appears exorbitant in the extreme, however conformable it may be to cu&s;tom
<PB N="78" REF="029737_0077_0FE2470CE9A53588">
and u&s;age: I therefore think that rea&s;onable &s;tipends had better be fixed upon. Both the quarter-ma&s;ter and com|mi&s;&s;ary-generals a&s;&s;ure me, that they do not employ a &s;ingle per&s;on u&s;ele&s;sly: and as I have too good an opinion of them to think they would deceive me, I believe them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take the liberty, in this place, of recommending the expediency, indeed the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, of appoint|ing fit and proper per&s;ons to &s;ettle the accounts of this army. To do it with preci&s;ion, requires time, care, and attention: the longer it is left undone, the more intricate they will be, the more liable to error, and difficult to ex|plain and rectify;&mdash;as al&s;o the per&s;ons in who&s;e hands they are (if di&s;po&s;ed to take undue advantage) will be le&s;s &s;ubject to detection. I have been as attentive as the nature of my office would admit of, in granting warrants for mon|ey on the pay-ma&s;ter: but it would be ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;i|ble for me to go into an examination of all the accounts incident to this army, and the vouchers appertaining to them, without devoting &s;o large a portion of my time to the bu&s;ine&s;s, as might not only prove injurious, but fatal to it in other re&s;pects. This ought, in my humble opinion, to be the particular bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;elect committe of Con|gre&s;s, or one appointed by them, who, once in three months at furthe&s;t, &s;hould make a &s;ettlement with the officers in the different departments.</P>
<P>Having met with no encouragement from the govern|ments of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-Hamp&s;hire, from my application for arms, and expecting no better from Con|necticut and Rhode-I&s;land, I have, as the la&s;t expedient, &s;ent one or two officers from each regiment into the country, with money, to try if they can buy. In what manner they &s;ucceed, Congre&s;s &s;hall be informed as &s;oon as they return.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s, in my la&s;t, would di&s;cover my motives for &s;trengthening the&s;e lines with the militia: but whether, as the weather turns out exceedingly mild, in&s;omuch as to promi&s;e nothing favourable from ice,&mdash;and no appearance of powder,&mdash;I &s;hall be able to attempt any thing deci&s;ive, time only can determine. No man upon earth wi&s;hes more ardently to de&s;troy the ne&s;t in Bo&s;ton, than I do:&mdash;no per&s;on would be willing to go greater lengths than I
<PB N="79" REF="029737_0078_0FE24760470C5A10">
&s;hall, to accompli&s;h it, if it &s;hall be thought advi&s;eable. But if we have neither powder to bombard with, nor ice to pa&s;s on, we &s;hall be in no better &s;ituation than we have been in all the year:&mdash;we &s;hall be wor&s;e, becau&s;e their works are &s;tronger.</P>
<P>I have accounts from Bo&s;ton, which I think may be relied on, that general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">inton, with about four or five hundred men, hath left that place within the&s;e four days. Whether this is part of the detachment which was mak|ing up (as mentioned in my letter of the fourth in&s;tant, and then at Nanta&s;ket) or not, is not in my power to &s;ay. If it is de&s;igned for New-York or Long-I&s;land as &s;ome think, throwing a body of troops there may prove a for|tunate circum&s;tance. If they go farther &s;outh agreeable to the conjectures of others, I hope there will be men to receive them.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions of the four cap|tains from Port&s;mouth, noticed in my letter of the four|teenth, I am now convinced from &s;everal corroborating circum&s;tances,&mdash;the accounts of de&s;erters, and of a lieu|tenant Hill, of lord Percy's regiment, who left Ireland the fifth of November, and was taken by a privateer from Newburyport,&mdash;that the &s;eventeenth and fifty-fifth regi|ments are arrived at Bo&s;ton, and other troops at Halifax, agreeable to the information of Hutchin&s;on and others. Lieutenant Hill &s;ays that the tran&s;ports of two regiments only were forced into Milford Haven.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s will think me a little remi&s;s, I fear, when I inform them that I have done nothing yet towards rai&s;ing the battalion of marines: but I hope to &s;tand exculpated from blame, when they hear the rea&s;on, which was, that already having twenty-&s;ix incomplete regiments, I thought it would be adding to an expen&s;e, already great, in officers, to &s;et two entire corps of officers on foot, when perhaps we &s;hould not add ten men a week by it to our pre&s;ent numbers. In this opinion the general officers have concur|red, which induced me to &s;u&s;pend the matter a little long|er. Our enli&s;tments, for the two la&s;t weeks, have not amounted to a thou&s;and men, and are dimini&s;hing. The regiment for Canada (it is thought) will &s;oon be filled, as
<PB N="80" REF="029737_0079_0FE2470E6E5E21E8">
the men are to choo&s;e all but their field officers, who are appointed by the court.</P>
<P>On Sunday evening, thirteen of the Caghnewaga In|dians arrived here on a vi&s;it. I &s;hall take care that they be &s;o entertained during their &s;tay, that they may return impre&s;&s;ed with &s;entiments of friend&s;hip for us, and al&s;o of our great &s;trength. One of them is colonel Louis, who honoured me with a vi&s;it once before.</P>

<P>YOUR favours of the &s;ixth and twentieth in&s;tant I received ye&s;terday, with the &s;everal re&s;olves of Congre&s;s alluded to; for which I return you my thanks.</P>
<P>Knowing the great importance Canada will be of to us in the pre&s;ent intere&s;ting conte&s;t, and the relief our friends there &s;tand in need of, I &s;hould be happy, were it in my power to detach a battalion from this camp: but it can|not be done. On the nineteeth in&s;tant, I had the hon|our to write to you, which will fully convey the re&s;olu|tions of a council of war, and the &s;entiments of the gener|al officers here, as to the propriety and expediency of &s;ending troops from the&s;e lines, for the defence of which we have been and now are obliged to call in the militia;&mdash;to which I beg leave to refer you. You may re&s;t a&s;|&s;ured that my endeavours and exertions &s;hall not be want|ing, to &s;timulate the governments of Connecticut and New-Hamp&s;hire to rai&s;e and forward reinforcements as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; nor in any other in&s;tance that will pro|mote the expedition.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, in obedience to the order of Congre&s;s, though interdicted by general Howe, propo&s;e an exchange of governor Skene for Mr. Lovell and family, and &s;hall be happy to have an opportunity of putting this de&s;erving man (who has di&s;tingui&s;hed his fidelity and regard to his country to be too great for per&s;ecution and cruelty to overcome) in any po&s;t agreeable to his wi&s;hes and in|clination.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="029737_0080_0FE24761CCEC0390">
I do not know that there is any particular rank annex|ed to the office of aide-de-camp. Generally they are captains, and rank as &s;uch: but higher rank is often given on account of particular merit and particular circum|&s;tances. Aides to the king have the rank of colonels. Whether any di&s;tinction &s;hould be made between tho&s;e of your commander-in-chief and the other generals, I really know not:&mdash;I think there ought.</P>
<P>You may rely that Conolly had in&s;tructions conceal|ed in his &s;addle. Mr. * * * who was one of lord Dunmore's family, and another gentleman who wi&s;hes his name not to be mentioned, &s;aw them ca&s;ed in tin, put in the tree, and covered over. He probably has exchanged his &s;addle, or withdrew the papers when it was mended, as you conjecture. Tho&s;e that have been di&s;covered are &s;ufficiently bad; but I doubt not of the others being wor&s;e, and containing more diabolical and exten&s;ive plans. I hope he will be taken proper care of, and meet with re|wards equal to his merits.</P>
<P>I &s;hall appoint officers in the places of tho&s;e who are in Canada, as I am fully per&s;uaded they will wi&s;h to con|tinue there, for making our conque&s;t complete in that quarter. I wi&s;h their bravery and valour may be attend|ed with the &s;miles of fortune.</P>
<P>It gives me great plea&s;ure to hear of the mea&s;ures Con|gre&s;s are taking for manufacturing powder. I hope their endeavours will be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. I too well know and regret the want of it. It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the di&s;advantages an army mu&s;t labour under, when not provided with a &s;ufficient &s;upply of this nec|e&s;&s;ary. It may &s;eem &s;trange, that, after having received about eleven tons, added to about five tons which I found here, and no general action has happened, we &s;hould be &s;o deficient in this article, and require more. But you will plea&s;e to con&s;ider, that, be&s;ides its being in its nature &s;ub|ject to wa&s;te, and (whil&s;t the men lay in bad tents) una|voidably damaged by &s;evere and heavy rains (which could not have been prevented, unle&s;s it had been entirely with|drawn from the men, and an attack hazarded again&s;t us without ammunition in their hands)&mdash;the armed ve&s;&s;els, our own occa&s;ional firings, and &s;ome &s;mall &s;upplies I have
<PB N="82" REF="029737_0081_0FE2470FF0EF05F8">
been obliged to afford the &s;ea-port towns threatened with de&s;truction,&mdash;to which may be added the &s;upply to the mi|litia, and going off of the old troops,&mdash;have occa&s;ioned, and ever will, a large con&s;umption of it, and wa&s;te, in &s;pite of all the care in the world. The king's troops never have le&s;s than &s;ixty rounds a man in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, independ|ent of their &s;tores. To &s;upply an army of twenty thou|&s;and men in this manner, would take near four hundred barrels, allowing nothing for &s;tores, artillery, &amp;c. I have been always afraid to place more than twelve or fifteen rounds at a time in the hands of our men, le&s;t, any acci|dent happening to it, we &s;hould be left de&s;titute, and be undone. I have been thus particular, not only to &s;hew our poverty, but to exculpate my&s;elf from even a &s;u&s;picion of unnece&s;&s;ary wa&s;te.</P>
<P>I &s;hall inform the pay-ma&s;ter-general of the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s re&s;pecting his draughts, and the mode and account of them.</P>
<P>The companies at Chel&s;ea and Malden are and have always been regimented. It was not my intention to re|place with continental troops the independent companies at Hingham, Weymouth and Braintree. The&s;e places are expo&s;ed, but not more than Cape-Ann, Beverly, Sa|lem, Marblehead, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Is it the intention of Congre&s;s that the officers of the army &s;hould pay po&s;tage? They are not exempted by the re&s;olve of the ninth in&s;tant.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed, I have no doubt, to recol|lect that the five hundred thou&s;and dollars, now coming, are but little more than enough to bring us up to the fir&s;t day of this month; that to-morrow will be the la&s;t of it; and, by their re&s;olves, the troops are to be paid monthly.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h it was in my power to furni&s;h Congre&s;s with &s;uch a general as they de&s;ire, to &s;end to Canada. Since the un|happy rever&s;e of our affairs in that quarter, general Schuy|ler has informed me, that, though he had thoughts of declin|ing the &s;ervice before, he would now act. My letter of the eleventh will inform them of general Lee's being at New-York. He will be ready to obey their orders, &s;hould they incline to &s;end him: but, if I am not greatly deceived, he or &s;ome other &s;pirited able officer will be wanted there

in the &s;pring, if not &s;ooner; as we have undoubted intelli|gence that general Clinton has &s;ailed with &s;ome troops. The reports of their number are various, from between four and five hundred to nineteen companies of grenadiers and light infantry. It is al&s;o imagined that the regiments, which were to &s;ail the fir&s;t of December, are intended for that place or Virginia. General Putnam is a mo&s;t valuable man, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine executive officer: but I do not know how he would conduct in a &s;eparate department. He is a young|er major-general than Mr. Schuyler, who, as I have ob|&s;erved, having determined to continue in the &s;ervice, will, I expect, repair into Canada. A copy of my letter to him, on this and other &s;ubjects, I inclo&s;e you, as it will explain my motives for not &s;topping the regiments from the&s;e gov|ernments.</P>
<P>When captain Cockran arrives, I will give him every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power, in obedience to the orders of Con|gre&s;s: but I fear it will be the means of laying up our own ve&s;&s;els, as the&s;e people will not bear the di&s;tinction. Should this be the con&s;equence, it will be highly preju|dicial to us, as we &s;ometimes pick up their provi&s;ion-ve&s;&s;els, and may continue to di&s;tre&s;s them in this way.</P>
<P>La&s;t week captain Manly took a &s;hip and a brig bound to Bo&s;ton from Whitehaven, with coals chiefly, and &s;ome potatoes, for the army. I have, for his great vigilance and indu&s;try, appointed him commodore of our little &s;quad|ron; and he now hoi&s;ts his flag on board the &s;chooner Hancock.</P>
<P>I congratulate you upon the recovery of Smith, and am exceedingly glad to hear of the mea&s;ures Congre&s;s are tak|ing for the general defence of the continent. The clouds thicken fa&s;t: where they will bur&s;t, I know not: but we &s;hould be armed at all points.</P>
<P>I have not &s;ucceeded in my applications to the&s;e govern|ments for arms. They have returned for an&s;wer, that they cannot furni&s;h any. Whether I &s;hall be more lucky in the la&s;t re&s;ource left me in this quarter, I cannot deter|mine, having not received returns from the officers &s;ent out to purcha&s;e of the people. I greatly fear that but very few will be procured in this way, as they are exceedingly &s;carce, and but a &s;mall part of what there are, fit for &s;er|vice.

When they make their report, you &s;hall be in|formed.</P>
<P>The quarter-ma&s;ter-general has ju&s;t received from gen|eral Schuyler clothing for the &s;oldiery, amounting to about &s;eventeen hundred pounds York currency. It has come very &s;ea&s;onably, as they are in great want, and will con|tribute a little to their relief.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, I &s;aw Mr. * * *, and men|tioning that nothing had been found in the tree of Conol|ly's &s;addle, he told me there had been a mi&s;take in the matter; that the in&s;tructions were artfully concealed on the two pieces of wood which are on the mail-pillion of his portmanteau-&s;addle; that, by order of lord Dun|more, he &s;aw them contrived for the purpo&s;e, the papers put in, and fir&s;t covered with tin, and over that with a waxed canva&s;s cloth. He is &s;o exceedingly pointed and clear in his information, that I have no doubt of its being true. I could wi&s;h them to be di&s;covered, as I think they contain &s;ome curious and extraordinary plans.</P>
<P>In my letter of the twenty-fourth in&s;tant I mentioned the arrival of thirteen of our Caghnewaga friends. They honoured me with a talk to-day, as did three of the tribes of the St. John's and Pafmiquoddi Indians;&mdash;copies of which I beg leave to inclo&s;e you. I &s;hall write to general Schuyler re&s;pecting the tender of &s;ervice made by the for|mer, and not to call for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, unle&s;s he &s;hall at any time want it, or be under the nece&s;&s;ity of doing it to prevent their taking the &s;ide of our enemies.</P>
<P>I had the honour of writing you on the nineteenth of November, and then I informed you of having engaged two per&s;ons to go to Nova-Scotia on the bu&s;ine&s;s recom|mended in your letter of the tenth; and al&s;o that the &s;tate of the army would not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n admit of a &s;ufficient force be|ing &s;ent, for carrying into execution the views of Congre&s;s re&s;pecting the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ck-yards, &amp;c.&mdash;I would now beg leave to mention, that, if the per&s;ons, &s;ent for information, &s;hould report favourably of the expediency and practicability of the mea&s;ure, it will not be in my power to detach any men from the&s;e lines: the &s;ituation of our affairs will not allow it. I think it would be advi&s;eable to rai&s;e them in the ea&s;t|ern parts of this government. If it is attempted, it mu&s;t

A colonel * * * and a captain * * * have been with me:&mdash;they think the men nece&s;&s;ary may be ea&s;ily engaged there, and the mea&s;ure prac|ticable: provided there are not more than two hundred Briti&s;h troops at Halifax, they are willing and ready to embark in the matter, upon the terms mentioned in their plan, which I inclo&s;e you. I would wi&s;h you to advert to the con&s;iderations inducing them to the expedition, as I am not without apprehen&s;ion, &s;hould it be undertaken upon their plan, that the innocent and guilty will be involved in one common ruin. I pre&s;ume they do not expect to receive more than the five or ten thou&s;and pounds mentioned in their &s;cheme, and to be at every expen&s;e. If we had men to &s;pare, it might be undertaken for le&s;s than either, I con|ceive. Perhaps, if Congre&s;s do not adopt their propo&s;i|tion, they will undertake to rai&s;e men for that particular purpo&s;e, who may be di&s;banded as &s;oon as it is effected, and upon the &s;ame terms that are allowed the continental troops in general. Whatever may be the determination of Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject, you will plea&s;e to communicate it to me immediately: for the &s;ea&s;on mo&s;t favourable for the enterpri&s;e is advancing fa&s;t; and we may expect in the &s;pring, that there will be more troops there, and the mea&s;|ure be more difficult to execute.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE purport of this letter will be directed to a &s;ingle object: through you, I mean to lay it before Congre&s;s; and, at the &s;ame time that&punc; I beg their &s;erious attention to the &s;ubject, to a&s;k pardon for intruding an opinion, not only una&s;ked, but, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, repugnant to their re&s;olves.</P>
<P>The di&s;advantages attending the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mited enli&s;tment of troops are too apparent to tho&s;e who are eye-witne&s;&s;es of them, to render any animadver&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary: but to gen|tlemen at a di&s;tance, who&s;e attention is engro&s;&s;ed by a thou|&s;and important objects, the ca&s;e may be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>That this cau&s;e precipitated the fate of the brave and much-to-be-lamented general Montgomery, and brought on
<PB N="86" REF="029737_0085_0FE2471B52DC04A8">
the defeat which followed thereupon, I have not the mo&s;t di&s;tant doubt: for, had he not been apprehen&s;ive of the troops leaving him at &s;o important a cri&s;is, but continued the blockade of Quebec, a capitulation (from the be&s;t ac|counts I have been able to collect) mu&s;t inevitably have followed. And that we were not at one time obliged to di&s;pute the&s;e lines under di&s;advantageous circum&s;tances (proceeding from the &s;ame cau&s;e, to wit, the troops di&s;band|ing of them&s;elves before the militia could be got in) is to me a matter of wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment: and proves that general Howe was either unacquainted with our &s;ituation, or re&s;trained by his in&s;tructions from putting any thing to a hazard till his reinforcements &s;hould arrive.</P>
<P>The in&s;tance of general Montgomery&mdash;(I mention it be|cau&s;e it is a &s;triking one; for a number of others might be adduced)&mdash;proves, that in&s;tead of having men to take advantage of circum&s;tances, you are in a manner compelled, right or wrong, to make circum&s;tances yield to a &s;econdary con&s;ideration. Since the fir&s;t of December, I have been devi&s;ing every means in my power to &s;ecure the&s;e encamp|ments; and, though I am &s;en&s;ible that we never have, &s;ince that period, been able to act upon the offen&s;ive, and at times not in a condition to defend, yet the co&s;t of marching home one &s;et of men,&mdash;bringing in another,&mdash;the havoc and wa&s;te occa&s;ioned by the fir&s;t,&mdash;the repairs nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ec|ond, with a thou&s;and incidental charges and inconveniences which have ari&s;en, and which it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible either to recollect or de&s;cribe&mdash;amount to near as much, as the keeping up a re&s;pectable body of troops the whole time, ready for any emergency, would have done. To this may be added, that you never can have a well-di&s;ciplined army.</P>
<P>To bring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> well acquainted with the duties of a &s;ol|dier, requires time. To bring them under proper di&s;cipline and &s;ubordination, not only requires time, but is a work of great difficulty, and, in this army where there is &s;o little di&s;tinction between the officers and &s;oldiers, requires an uncommon degree of attention. To expect then the &s;ame &s;ervice from raw and undi&s;ciplined recruits as from veteran &s;oldiers, is to expect what never did and perhaps never will happen. Men who are familiari&s;ed to danger meet it with|out &s;hrinking&punc; whereas tho&s;e who have never &s;een &s;ervice
<PB N="87" REF="029737_0086_0FE2476D6F8F52D0">
often apprehend danger where no danger is. Three things prompt men to a regular di&s;charge of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in time of action&mdash;natural bravery, hope of reward, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of pun|i&s;hment. The two fir&s;t are common to the untutored and the di&s;ciplined &s;oldier: but the latter mo&s;t obviou&s;ly di&s;|tingui&s;hes the one from the other. A coward, when taught to believe, that, if he breaks his ranks and abandons his colours, he will be puni&s;hed with death by his own party&mdash;will take his chance again&s;t the enemy: but a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> who thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s little of the one&punc; and is fearful of the other, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from pre&s;ent feelings, regardle&s;s of con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Again, men of a day's &s;tanding will not look forward: and from experience we find, that, as the time approaches for their di&s;charge, they grow carele&s;s of their arms, am|munition, camp uten&s;ils, &amp;c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, even the barracks them|&s;elves have felt uncommon marks of wanton depredation, and lay us under fre&s;h trouble and additional expen&s;e in providing for every fre&s;h &s;et, when we find it next to im|po&s;&s;ible to procure &s;uch articles as are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. To this may be added the &s;ea&s;oning which new recruits mu&s;t have to a camp, and the lo&s;s con|&s;equent thereupon. But this is not all. Men, engaged for a &s;hort limited time only, have the officers too much in their power: for, to obtain a degree of popularity in order to induce a &s;econd enli&s;tment, a kind of familiarity takes place, which brings on a rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">tion of di&s;cipline, unlicen&s;|ed furloughs, and other indulgences incompatible with order and good government; by which means, the latter part of the time for which the &s;oldier was engaged is &s;pent in undoing what you were aiming to inculcate in the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>To go into an enumeration of all the evils we have ex|perienced in this late great change of the army, and the expen&s;es incidental to it&mdash;to &s;ay nothing of the hazard we have run, and mu&s;t run, between the di&s;charging of one army and enli&s;tment of another, unle&s;s an enormous ex|pen&s;e of militia is incurred&mdash;would greatly exceed the bounds of a letter. What I have already taken the liberty of &s;aying will &s;erve to convey a general idea of the matter; and therefore I &s;hall, with all due deference, take the freedom to give it as my opinion, that, if the Congre&s;s have any rea&s;on to believe that there will be occa&s;ion for
<PB N="88" REF="029737_0087_0FE2471CD698B2D0">
troops another year, and con&s;equently of another enli&s;t|ment, they would &s;ave money, and have infinitely better troops, if they were, even at a bounty of twenty, thirty, or more dollars, to engage the men already enli&s;ted (till Jan|uary next) and &s;uch others as may be wanted to complete the e&s;tabli&s;hment, for and during the war. I will not un|dertake to &s;ay that the men can be had upon the&s;e terms: but I am &s;atisfied that it will never do to let the matter alone, as it was la&s;t year, till the time of &s;ervice was near expiring. The hazard is too great in the fir&s;t place:&mdash;in the next, the trouble and perplexity of di&s;banding one ar|my and rai&s;ing another at the &s;ame in&s;tant, and in &s;uch a critical &s;ituation as the la&s;t was, is &s;carcely in the power of words to de&s;cribe, and &s;uch as no man, who has experi|enced it once, will ever undergo again.</P>
<P>If Congre&s;s &s;hould differ from me in &s;entiment upon this point, I have only to beg that they will do me the ju&s;tice to believe, that I have nothing more in view than what to me appears nece&s;&s;ary to advance the public weal, although in the fir&s;t in&s;tance it will be attended with a capital ex|pen&s;e;&mdash;and that I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>IN compliance with the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, I have applied to general Howe for the exchange of Mr. Lovell. A copy of my letter, and his an&s;wer thereto, you have inclo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Captain Watters and captain Tucker, who command two of the armed &s;chooners, have taken and &s;ent into Gloc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ter a large brigantine, laden with wood, a hundred and fifty butts for water, and forty &s;uits of bedding, bound from La Have in Nova-Scotia, for Bo&s;ton. She is one of the tran&s;ports in the mini&s;terial &s;ervice. The captain &s;ays that he was at Halifax the &s;eventeenth of January, and that general Ma&s;&s;ey was arrived there with two regi|ments from Ireland.</P>
<P>The different prizes were all libelled immediately on the receipt of the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s pointing out the mode; but none of them yet brought to trial, owing to a difference be|tween
<PB N="89" REF="029737_0088_0FE2476EF390AF00">
the law pa&s;&s;ed in this province, and the re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s. The general court are making an amendment to their law, by which the difficulties that now occur will be removed, as I under&s;tand it is to be made conformable to your re&s;olves. The unavoidable delay attending the bring|ing the captures to trial is grievou&s;ly complained of by the ma&s;ters of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, as well as the captors. Many of the former have applied for liberty to go away without waiting the deci&s;ion&mdash;which I have granted them.</P>
<P>I beg leave to recall the attention of Congre&s;s to their appointing a commi&s;&s;ary in the&s;e parts, to attend the pro|viding of nece&s;&s;aries for the pri&s;oners who are di&s;per&s;ed in the&s;e provinces. Complaints are made by &s;ome of them, that they are in want of bedding and many other things. As I under&s;tand that Mr. Franks has undertaken that bu&s;ine&s;s, I wi&s;h he was ordered to &s;end a deputy immedi|ately to &s;ee that the pri&s;oners get what is allowed them by Congre&s;s; al&s;o to &s;upply the officers with money as they may have occa&s;ion. It would &s;ave me much time and much trouble.</P>
<P>There are yet but few companies of the militia come in. This delay will, I am much afraid, fru&s;trate the intention of their being called upon, as the &s;ea&s;on is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lipping fa&s;t away when they may be of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The demands of the army were &s;o very pre&s;&s;ing before your la&s;t remittance came to hand, that I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of borrowing twenty-five thou&s;and pounds lawful money from this province. They very cheerfully lent it, and pa&s;&s;ed a vote for as much more, if required. I have not repaid the &s;um borrowed, as I may &s;tand in need of it before the arrival of another &s;upply, which the demands of the commi&s;&s;ary-general, quarter-ma&s;ter-general, and paying off the arrearages, will very &s;oon require.</P>
<P>Your e&s;teemed favour of the twenty-ninth ultimo is ju&s;t come to hand. It makes me very happy to find my con|duct to hath met the approbation of Congre&s;s. I am entirely of your opinion, that, &s;hould an accommodation take place, the terms will be &s;evere or favourable in proportion to our ability to re&s;i&s;t, and that we ought to be on a re&s;pectable footing to receive their armaments in the &s;pring. But how far we &s;hall be provided with the means, is a matter I pro|fe&s;s

not to know, under my pre&s;ent unhappy want of arms, ammunition, and,. I may add, men&mdash;as our regiments are very incomplete. The recruiting goes on very &s;low, and will, I apprehend, be more &s;o, if for other &s;ervice the men receive a bounty, and none is given here.</P>
<P>I have tried every method I could think of, to procure arms for our men. They really are not to be had in the&s;e governments (belonging to the public;) and if &s;ome meth|od is not fallen upon, in the &s;outhern governments, to &s;upply us, we &s;hall be in a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation for want of them. There are near two thou&s;and men now in camp without firelocks. I have wrote to the committee of New-York this day, reque&s;ting them to &s;end me tho&s;e arms which were taken from the di&s;affected in that government. The Congre&s;s intere&s;ting them&s;elves in this reque&s;t will doubtle&s;s have a good effect. I have &s;ent officers into the country, with money to purcha&s;e arms in the different towns. Some have returned, and brought in a few:&mdash;many are &s;till out:&mdash;what their &s;ucce&s;s will be, I cannot determine.</P>
<P>I was in great hopes that the expre&s;&s;es, re&s;olved to be e&s;tabli&s;hed between this place and Philadelphia, would ere now have been fixed. It would, in my opinion, rather &s;ave than increa&s;e the expen&s;e; as many hor&s;es are de|&s;troyed by one man coming the whole way. It will cer|tainly be more expeditious, and &s;afer, than writing by the po&s;t or private hands, which I am often under the nece&s;&s;ity of doing.</P>

<P>THROUGH you, I beg leave to lay before Con|gre&s;s the inclo&s;ed letter from lord Drummond to general Robert&s;on, which came to my hands a few days ago in order to be &s;ent into Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>As I never heard of his lord&s;hip being ve&s;ted with pow|er to treat with Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject of our grievances, nor of his having laid any propo&s;itions before them for an accommodation, I confe&s;s it &s;urpri&s;ed me much, and led me to form various conjectures of his motives, and intend|ed application to general Howe and admiral Shuldham for a pa&s;&s;port for the &s;afe-conduct of &s;uch deputies as Congre&s;s might appoint for negociating terms of reconciliation be|tween Great Britain and us. Whatever his intentions are, however benevolent his de&s;igns may be, I confe&s;s that his letter has embarra&s;&s;ed me much; and I am not without &s;u&s;picion of its meaning more than the generous purpo&s;es it profe&s;&s;es. I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that, if the mode for negoci|ation, which he points out, &s;hould be adopted (which I hope will never be thought of) it ought to have been fixed and &s;ettled previous to any application of this &s;ort; and at be&s;t, that his conduct in this in&s;tance is premature and of|ficious, and leading to con&s;equences of a fatal and injurious nature to the rights of this country. His zeal and de&s;ire perhaps of an amicable and con&s;titutional adju&s;tment's tak|ing place may have &s;ugge&s;ted and precipitated the mea&s;ure. Be that as it may, I thought it of too much importance, to &s;uffer it to go in without having the expre&s;s direction of
<PB N="92" REF="029737_0091_0FE2472568D03A18">
Congre&s;s for that purpo&s;e; and that it was my indi&s;pen&s;able duty to tran&s;mit them the original, to make &s;uch interpre|tations and inferences as they may think right.</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;rs. Willard and Child, who were &s;ent to Nova-Scotia in pur&s;uance of the re&s;olve of Congre&s;s, have ju&s;t returned, and made their report, which I do my&s;elf the honour to inclo&s;e you. They have not an&s;wered the pur|po&s;es of their commi&s;&s;ion by any means, as they only went a little way into that country, and found their intelligence upon the information of others. You will &s;ee the rea&s;ons they a&s;&s;ign in excu&s;e or ju&s;tification of their conduct, in the report it&s;elf.</P>
<P>La&s;t night a party of regulars, &s;aid to be about five hun|dred, landed on Dorche&s;ter neck, and burned &s;ome of the hou&s;es there, which were of no value to us; nor would they have been, unle&s;s we take po&s;t there: they then might be of &s;ome &s;ervice. A detachment went after them as &s;oon as the fire was di&s;covered: but, before it could arrive, they had executed their plan, and made their retreat.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed is a letter for David Franks, e&s;quire, from Mr. Chamier in Bo&s;ton, upon the &s;ubject of victualling &s;uch of the king's troops as may be pri&s;oners within the limits of his contract, which I beg the favour of you to deliver him, and that proper agents may be appointed by him, to &s;ee that it is done. I could wi&s;h, too, that Congre&s;s would fall upon &s;ome mode for &s;upplying the officers with &s;uch money as they may really &s;tand in need of, and depute proper per&s;ons for that purpo&s;e, and furni&s;hing the privates with &s;uch clothing as may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. I am appli|ed to, and wearied by their repeated reque&s;ts.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE late freezing weather having formed &s;ome pretty &s;trong ice from Dorche&s;ter point to Bo&s;ton neck, and from Roxbury to the Common, thereby affording a more expanded and con&s;equently a le&s;s dangerous ap|proach to the town, I could not help thinking,&mdash;notwith|&s;tanding the militia were not all come in, and we had little or no powder to begin our operation by a regular cannonade or bombardment,&mdash;that a bold and re&s;olute a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ault upon the troops in Bo&s;ton with &s;uch men as we had (for it could not take many men to guard our own lines at a time when the enemy were attacked in all quarters) might be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s: and therefore, &s;eeing no certain pro&s;pect of a &s;upply of powder on the one hand, and a certain di&s;&s;olution of the ice on the other, I called the general officers together, for their opinion, agreeably to the re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ove of Congre&s;s, of the twenty-&s;econd of De|cember.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult will appear in the inclo&s;ed council of war; and, being almo&s;t unanimous, I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it to be right; although, from a thorough conviction of the nece&s;&s;ity of attempting &s;omething again&s;t the mini&s;terial troops before a reinforcement &s;hould arrive, and while we were favoured with the ice, I was not only ready, but willing, and de&s;ir|ous of making the a&s;&s;ault, under a firm hope (if the men would have &s;tood by me) of a favourable i&s;&s;ue, notwith|&s;tanding the enemy's advantage of ground, artillery, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Perhaps the irk&s;omene&s;s of my &s;ituation may have given different ideas to me, than tho&s;e which influenced the gentlemen I con&s;ulted, and might have inclined me to put more to the hazard than was con&s;i&s;tent with pru|dence:&mdash;if it had, I am not &s;en&s;ible of it, as I endeavour|ed to give it all the con&s;ideration that a matter of &s;uch importance required. True it is, and I cannot help ac|knowledging, that I have many di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations on account of my &s;ituation: for, to have the eyes of the whole continent fixed with anxious expectation of hear|ing of &s;ome great event,&mdash;and to be re&s;trained in every military operation, for want of the nece&s;&s;ary means of carrying it on,&mdash;is not very plea&s;ing, e&s;pecially as the
<PB N="94" REF="029737_0093_0FE2472889FCE668">
means u&s;ed to conceal my weakne&s;s from the enemy, conceal it al&s;o from our friends, and add to their wonder.</P>
<P>I do not utter this by way of complaint. I am &s;en&s;ible that all that the Congre&s;s can do, they have done; and I &s;hould feel mo&s;t powerfully the weight of con&s;cious in|gratitude were I not to acknowledge this. But as we have accounts of the arrival of powder in captain Ma&s;on, I would beg to have it &s;ent on in the mo&s;t expeditious manner: otherwi&s;e we not only lo&s;e all chance of the ben|efits re&s;ulting from the &s;ea&s;on, but of the militia, who are brought in at a mo&s;t enormous expen&s;e, upon a pre&s;ump|tion that we &s;hould, long ere this, have been amply &s;upplied with powder, under the contracts entered into with the committee of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The militia, contrary to an expre&s;s requi&s;ition, are come and coming in without ammunition. To &s;upply them alone with twenty-four rounds (which is le&s;s, by three fifths, than the regulars are &s;erved with) will take between fifty and &s;ixty barrels of powder; and to complete the other troops to the like quantity, will take near as much more, and leave in &s;tore not more than about &s;ixty barrels, be&s;ides a few rounds of cannon cartridges ready filled for u&s;e. This, Sir, Congre&s;s may be a&s;&s;ured, is a true &s;tate of our powder, and will, I hope, bear &s;ome te&s;timony of my in|capacity for action in &s;uch a way as may do any e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 21.&mdash;When I began this letter, I propo&s;ed to have &s;ent it by expre&s;s. But recollecting that all my late letters have been as expre&s;&s;ive of my want of powder and arms as I could paint them, and that Mr. Hooper was to &s;et off in a day or two, I thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to run the continent to the expen&s;e of an expre&s;s, merely to re|peat what I had &s;o often done before, when I am certain that Congre&s;s, knowing our nece&s;&s;ities, will delay no time that can po&s;&s;ibly be avoided in &s;upplying them.</P>
<P>My duty is offered to Congre&s;s; and, with great re&s;pect and e&s;teem, I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you on the eigh|teenth and twenty-fir&s;t in&s;tant, by Mr. Hooper; &s;ince which, nothing material has occurred.</P>
<P>We are making every nece&s;&s;ary preparation for taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dorche&s;ter heights as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, with a view of drawing the enemy out. How far our expecta|tions may be an&s;wered, time only can determine: but I &s;hould think, if any thing will induce them to hazard an en|gagement, it will be our attempting to fortify the&s;e heights; as, on that event's taking place, we &s;hall be able to com|mand a great part of the town and almo&s;t the whole har|bour, and to make them rather di&s;agreeable than otherwi&s;e, provided we can get a &s;ufficient &s;upply of what we greatly want.</P>
<P>Within the&s;e three or four days, I have received &s;undry accounts from Bo&s;ton, of &s;uch movements there&mdash;(&s;uch as taking the mortars from Bunker's hill&mdash;the putting them, with &s;everal pieces of heavy ordnance, on board of &s;hip, with a quantity of bedding&mdash;the &s;hips all taking in water&mdash;the baking a large quantity of bi&s;cuit, &amp;c.)&mdash;as to indicate an embarkation of the troops from thence. A Mr. Ides, who came out ye&s;terday, &s;ays that the inhabitants of the town generally believe that they are about to remove either to New-York or Virginia, and that every ve&s;&s;el in the har|bour on Tue&s;day la&s;t was taken up for government's &s;er|vice, and two months' pay advanced them. Whether they really intend to embark, or whether the whole is a feint, is impo&s;&s;ible for me to tell. However I have thought it expedient to &s;end an expre&s;s to general Lee, to inform him of it&mdash;(in order that he may not be taken by &s;urpri&s;e, if their de&s;tination &s;hould be again&s;t New-York)&mdash;and con|tinued him on to you. If they do embark, I think the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of that place, and of the North-river, is the object they have in view, thereby &s;ecuring the com|munication with Canada, and rendering the intercour&s;e be|tween
<PB N="96" REF="029737_0095_0FE2472A0C4B2010">
the northern and &s;outhern United Colonies exceed|ingly precarious and difficult. To prevent them from ef|fecting their plan, is a matter of the highe&s;t importance, and will require a large and re&s;pectable army, and the mo&s;t vigilant and judicious exertions.</P>
<P>Since I wrote by Mr. Hooper, &s;ome &s;mall parcels of powder have arrived from Connecticut, which will give us a little a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day night a party of our men at Roxbury made the enemy's out-centries, con&s;i&s;ting of a corporal and two privates, pri&s;oners, without firing a gun or giving the lea&s;t alarm.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be as attentive to the enemy's motions as I can, and obtain all the intelligence in my power; and, if I find them embark, &s;hall in the mo&s;t expeditious manner detach a part of the light troops to New-York, and repair thither my&s;elf if circum&s;tances &s;hall require it. I &s;hall be better able to judge what to do, when the matter happens. At pre&s;ent, I can only &s;ay that I will do every thing that &s;hall appear proper and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Your letter of the twelfth in&s;tant, by colonel Bull, came to hand ye&s;terday evening: and I &s;hall, agreeable to your recommendation, pay proper notice to him. The &s;upply of ca&s;h came very &s;ea&s;onably, as our trea&s;ury was ju&s;t ex|hau&s;ted, and nothing can be done here without it.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the twenty-&s;ixth ultimo I had the honour of ad|dre&s;&s;ing you, and then mentioned that we were making prep|arations for taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dorche&s;ter heights. I now beg leave to inform you, that, a council of general officers having determined a previous bombardment and cannonade expedient and proper, in order to hara&s;s the enemy and divert their attention from that quarter&mdash;on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday nights la&s;t, we carried
<PB N="97" REF="029737_0096_0FE2477D22F02EF0">
them on from our po&s;ts at Coble-hill, Leechmore's-point, and Lam's-dam. Whether they did the enemy any con|&s;iderable and what injury, I have not yet heard, but have the plea&s;ure to acquaint you that they greatly facilitated our &s;chemes, and would have been attended with &s;ucce&s;s equal to our mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations, had it not been for the unlucky bur&s;ting of two thirteen, and three ten-inch mortars, among which was the bra&s;s one taken in the ord|nance brig. To what cau&s;e to attribute this misfortune, I know not&mdash;whether to any defect in them, or to the inex|perience of the bombardiers. But to return&mdash;on Monday evening, as &s;oon as our firing commenced, a con&s;iderable detachment of our men, under the command of brigadier-general Thomas, cro&s;&s;ed the neck, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the two hills, without the lea&s;t interruption or annoyance from the enemy; and by their great activity and indu&s;try, before the morning, advanced the works &s;o far as to be &s;e|cure again&s;t their &s;hot. They are now going on with &s;uch expedition, that in a little time I hope they will be com|plete, and enable our troops &s;tationed there to make a vig|orous and ob&s;tinate &s;tand. During the whole cannonade, which was ince&s;&s;ant the la&s;t two nights, we were fortunate enough to lo&s;e but two men&mdash;one, a lieutenant, by a can|non ball's taking off his thigh&mdash;the other, a private, by the explo&s;ion of a &s;hell, which al&s;o &s;lightly wounded four or five more.</P>
<P>Our taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dorche&s;ter heights is only pre|paratory to taking po&s;t on Nuke-hill, and the points oppo|&s;ite the &s;outh end of Bo&s;ton. It was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould be previou&s;ly fortified, in order to cover and command them. As &s;oon as the works on the former are fini&s;hed and complete, mea&s;ures will be immediately adopted for &s;ecuring the latter, and making them as &s;trong and defen&s;ible as we can. Their contiguity to the enemy will make them of much importance, and of great &s;ervice to us.</P>
<P>As mortars are e&s;&s;ential, and indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on our operations, and for the pro&s;ecution of our plans, I have applied to two furnaces to have &s;ome thirteen-inch ones ca&s;t with all expedition imaginable, and am en|couraged to hope, from the accounts I have had, that they
<PB N="98" REF="029737_0097_0FE2472C92CFEB00">
will be able to do it. When they are done, and a proper &s;upply of powder obtained, I flatter my&s;elf, from the po&s;ts we have ju&s;t taken and are about to take, that it will be in our power to force the mini&s;terial troops to an attack, or to di&s;po&s;e of them in &s;ome way that will be of advantage to us. I think from the&s;e po&s;ts they will be &s;o galled and annoy|ed, that they mu&s;t either give us battle or quit their pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. I am re&s;olved that nothing on my part &s;hall be wanting, to effect the one or the other.</P>
<P>It having been the general opinion that the enemy would attempt to di&s;lodge our people from the hills, and force their works as &s;oon as they were di&s;covered, which proba|bly might have brought on a general engagement,&mdash;it was thought advi&s;eable that the honourable council &s;hould be applied to, to order in the militia from the neighbouring and adjacent towns. I wrote to them on the &s;ubject, which they mo&s;t readily complied with: and, in ju&s;tice to the militia, I cannot but inform you that they came in at the appointed time, and manife&s;ted the greate&s;t alertne&s;s, and determined re&s;olution to have acted like men engaged in the cau&s;e of freedom.</P>
<P>When the enemy fir&s;t di&s;covered our works in the morning, they &s;eemed to be in great confu&s;ion, and, from their movements, to have intended an attack. It is much to be wi&s;hed that it had been made: the event, I think, mu&s;t have been fortunate, and nothing le&s;s than &s;ucce&s;s and victory on our &s;ide, as our officers and men appeared impatient for the appeal, and to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t animated &s;entiments and determined re&s;olution.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day evening a con&s;iderable number of their troops embarked on board of their tran&s;ports, and fell down to the ca&s;tle, where part of them landed before dark. One or two of the ve&s;&s;els got a-ground, and were fired at by our people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> field-piece, but without any dam|age. What was the de&s;ign of this embarkation and land|ing, I have not been able to learn. It would &s;eem as if they meant an attack; for it is mo&s;t probable, that, if they make one on our works at Dorche&s;ter at this time, they will fir&s;t go to the ca&s;tle, and come from thence. If &s;uch was their de&s;ign, a violent &s;torm that night, and which la&s;ted till eight o'clock the next day, rendered the exe|cution
<PB N="99" REF="029737_0098_0FE2478730C66B70">
of it impracticable. It carried one or two of their ve&s;&s;els a-&s;hore, which have &s;ince got off.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e the mini&s;terial troops had made an attempt to di&s;lodge our men from Dorche&s;ter hills, and the number detached upon the occa&s;ion had been &s;o great as to have afforded a probability of a &s;ucce&s;sful attack's being made upon Bo&s;ton,&mdash;on a &s;ignal given from Roxbury for that purpo&s;e, agreeable to a &s;ettled and concerted plan, four thou&s;and cho&s;en men, who were held in readine&s;s, were to have embarked at the mouth of Cambridge river, in two divi&s;ions, the fir&s;t under the command of brigadier-general Sullivan, the &s;econd under brigadier-general Greene,&mdash;the whole to have been commanded by major-general Putnam. The fir&s;t divi&s;ion was to land at the powder-hou&s;e, and gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Beacon-hill and Mount-Horam,&mdash;the &s;econd at Barton's point or a little &s;outh of it, and, after &s;ecuring that po&s;t, to join the other divi&s;ion, and force the enemy's gates and works at the neck, for letting in the Roxbury troops. Three floating batteries were to have preceded, and gone in front of the other boats, and kept up a heavy fire on that part of the town were our men were to land.</P>
<P>How far our views would have &s;ucceeded, had an op|portunity offered for attempting the execution, is impo&s;&s;i|ble for me to &s;ay; nothing le&s;s than experiment could determine with preci&s;ion. The plan was thought to be well dige&s;ted; and, as far as I could judge from the cheer|fulne&s;s and alacrity which di&s;tingui&s;hed the officers and men who were to engage in the enterpri&s;e, I had rea&s;on to hope for a favourable and happy i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>The militia who were ordered in from the adjacent towns brought with them three days' provi&s;ion. They were only called upon to act under the idea of an attack's being immediately made, and were all di&s;charged this afternoon.</P>
<P>I beg leave to remind Congre&s;s that three major-gen|erals are e&s;&s;ential and nece&s;&s;ary for this army; and that by general Lee's being called from hence to the command in Canada, the left divi&s;ion is without one. I hope they will fill up the vacancy by the appointment of another. General Thomas is the fir&s;t brigadier, &s;tands fair in point
<PB N="100" REF="029737_0099_0FE248BAC5A33108">
of reputation, and is e&s;teemed a brave and good officer. If he is promoted, there will be a vacancy in the briga|dier-generals, which it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply by the appointment of &s;ome other gentleman that &s;hall be agreea|ble to Congre&s;s: but ju&s;tice requires me to mention that William Thomp&s;on, e&s;quire, of the rifle regiment, is the fir&s;t colonel in this department, and, as far as I have had an opportunity of judging, is a good officer and a man of courage. What I have &s;aid of the&s;e two gentlemen, I conceived to be my duty, at the &s;ame time acknowledg|ing, whatever promotions are made will be &s;atisfactory to me.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.&mdash;Ye&s;terday evening, a captain Irvine, who e&s;caped from Bo&s;ton the night before with &s;ix of his crew, came to head-quarters, and gave the following intelligence:&mdash;"That our bombardment and cannonade cau&s;ed a great deal of &s;urpri&s;e and alarm in town, as many of the &s;oldiery &s;aid they never heard or thought we had mortars of &s;hells;&mdash;that &s;everal of the officers acknowledg|ed they were well and properly directed; that they made much di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion;&mdash;that the cannon-&s;hot, for the greate&s;t part, went through the hou&s;es; and he was told that one took off the legs and arms of &s;ix men lying in the barracks on the neck;&mdash;that a &s;oldier, who came from the lines there on Tue&s;day morning, informed him that twenty men had been wounded the night before:&mdash;(it was reported that others were al&s;o hurt, and one of the light-hor&s;e torn to pieces by the explo&s;ion of a &s;hell: this was afterwards contradicted)&mdash;that, early on Tue&s;day morning, admiral Shuldham, di&s;covering the works our people were throwing up on Dorche&s;ter heights, imme|diately &s;ent an expre&s;s to general Howe, to inform him that it was nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be attacked and di&s;lodged from thence, or he would be under the nece&s;&s;ity of with|drawing the &s;hips from the harbour, which were under his command;&mdash;that preparations were directly made for that purpo&s;e, as it was &s;aid; and, from twelve to two o'clock, about three thou&s;and men embarked on board the tran&s;|ports, which fell down to the ca&s;tle with a de&s;ign of land|ing on that part of Dorche&s;ter next to it, and attacking our works on the heights at five o'clock next morning;&mdash;
<PB N="101" REF="029737_0100_0FE247D196A4A950">
that lord Percy was appointed to command;&mdash;that it was generally believed the attempt would have been made, had it not been for the violent &s;torm which happened that night, as I have mentioned before;&mdash;that he heard &s;everal of the privates, and one or two &s;erjeants, &s;ay as they were embarking, that it would be another Bunker's-hill affair."</P>
<P>He further informs&mdash;"that the army is preparing to leave Bo&s;ton, and that they will do it in a day or two;&mdash;that the tran&s;ports nece&s;&s;ary for their embarkation were getting ready with the utmo&s;t expedition;&mdash;that there had been great movements and confu&s;ion among the troops, the night and day preceding his coming out, in hurrying down their cannon, artillery and other &s;tores, to the wharfs, with the utmo&s;t precipitation; and they were putting them on board the &s;hips in &s;uch ha&s;te, that no account or memoran|dum was taken of them;&mdash;that mo&s;t of the cannon were removed from their works, and embarked or embarking;&mdash;that he heard a woman &s;ay, whom he took to be an officer's wife, that &s;he had &s;een men go under the ground at the lines on the neck, without returning;&mdash;that the &s;hip he commanded was taken up, places fitted, and fitting, for of|ficers to lodge, and &s;everal &s;hot, &s;hells, and cannon already on board;&mdash;that the tories were to have the liberty of go|ing where they plea&s;e, if they can get &s;eamen to man the ve&s;&s;els, of whom there was a great &s;carcity;&mdash;that, on that account, many ve&s;&s;els could not be carried away, and would be burned;&mdash;that many of the inhabitants apprehended the town would be de&s;troyed; and that it was generally thought their de&s;tination is Halifax."</P>
<P>The account given by captain Irvine, as to the embark|ation, and their being about to leave the town, I believe true. There are other circum&s;tances corroborating; and it &s;eems fully confirmed by a paper &s;igned by four of the &s;electmen of the town, (a copy of which I have the hon|our to inclo&s;e you) which was brought out ye&s;terday even|ing by a flag, and delivered to colonel Learned, by major Ba&s;&s;et of the tenth regiment, who de&s;ired it might be deliv|ered me as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. I advi&s;ed with &s;uch of the general officers upon the occa&s;ion as I could immediately a&s;&s;emble; and we determined it right (as it was not ad|dre&s;&s;ed to me or any one el&s;e, nor authenticated by the
<PB N="102" REF="029737_0101_0FE1BFA64F880F18">
&s;ignature of general Howe, or any other act obliging him to a performance of the promi&s;e mentioned on his part) that I &s;hould give it no an&s;wer; at the &s;ame time, that a letter &s;hould be returned, as going from colonel Learned, &s;ignifying his having laid it before me,&mdash;with the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for not an&s;wering it. A copy of this is &s;ent.</P>
<P>To-night I &s;hall have a battery thrown up on Nuke-hill (Dorche&s;ter point) with a de&s;ign of acting as circum&s;tances may require; it being judged advi&s;eable to pro&s;ecute our plans of fortification, as we intended before this informa|tion from the &s;electmen came.</P>
<P>It being agreed on all hands that there is no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;topping them in ca&s;e they determine to go,&mdash;I &s;hall order look-outs to be kept upon all the head-lands, to di&s;|cover their movements and cour&s;e, and moreover direct commodore Manly and his little &s;quadron to dog them, as well for the &s;ame purpo&s;e as for picking up any of their ve&s;&s;els that may chance to depart their convoy. From their loading with &s;uch precipitancy, it is pre&s;umable they will not be in the be&s;t condition for &s;ea.</P>
<P>If the mini&s;terial troops evacuate the town and leave it &s;tanding, I have thoughts of taking mea&s;ures for fortifying the entrance into the harbour, if it &s;hall be thought proper, and the &s;ituation of affairs will admit of it.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the report from Bo&s;ton that Halifax is the place of their de&s;tination, I have no doubt but that they are going to the &s;outhward of this,&mdash;and, I appre|hend, to New-York. Many rea&s;ons lead to this opinion: it is in &s;ome mea&s;ure corroborated by their &s;ending an ex|pre&s;s &s;hip there, which, on Wedne&s;day week, got on &s;hore and bilged at Cape-Cod. The di&s;patches, if written, were de&s;troyed when &s;he was boarded.

<P>I &s;hall hold the riflemen and other parts of our troops in readine&s;s to march at a moment's warning, and govern my movements by the events that happen, or &s;uch orders as I may receive from Congre&s;s, which I beg may be am|ple, and forwarded with all po&s;&s;ible expedition.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixth in&s;tant, a &s;hip bound from London, with &s;tores for the mini&s;terial army, con&s;i&s;ting of coal, porter,

and krout, fell in with our armed ve&s;&s;els, four of them in company, and was carried into Port&s;mouth. She had had a long pa&s;&s;age, and of cour&s;e brought no papers of a late date. The only letters of importance, or in the lea&s;t intere&s;ting that were found, I have inclo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I beg leave to mention to Congre&s;s that money is much wanted. The militia from the&s;e governments, engaged till the fir&s;t of April, are then to be paid: and, if we march from hence, the expen&s;e will be very con&s;iderable, mu&s;t be defrayed, and cannot be accompli&s;hed without it. The nece&s;&s;ity of making the earlie&s;t remittance for the&s;e purpo&s;es is too obvious for me to add more.</P>
<P>When I wrote that part of this letter which is antece|dent to this date, I fully expected it would have gone be|fore now by colonel Bull, not deeming it of &s;ufficient importance to &s;end a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger. But he deferred his return from time to time, and never &s;et off till to-day.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my letter of the &s;eventh and ninth in&s;tant which I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you, I mentioned the in|telligence I had received re&s;pecting the embarkation of the troops from Bo&s;ton; and fully expected, before this, that the town would have been entirely evacuated. Al|though I have been deceived, and was rather premature in the opinion I had then formed, I have little rea&s;on to doubt but the event will take place in a very &s;hort time, as other accounts which have come to hand &s;ince, of the &s;ailing of a great number of tran&s;ports from the har|bour to Nanta&s;ket-road, and many circum&s;tances corre&s;|ponding therewith, &s;eem to confirm and render it un|que&s;tionable.</P>
<P>Whether the town will be de&s;troyed, is a matter of much uncertainty: but it would &s;eem, from the de&s;truc|tion they are making of &s;undry pieces of furniture, of many of their waggons, carts, &amp;c. which they cannot take
<PB N="104" REF="029737_0103_0FE1BFB364DACC98">
with them as it is &s;aid, that it will not: for, if they in|tended it, the whole might be involved in one general ruin.</P>
<P>Holding it of the la&s;t importance in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t that we &s;hould &s;ecure New-York, and prevent the enemy from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it,&mdash;and conjecturing they have views of that &s;ort, and their embarkation to be for that purpo&s;e,&mdash;I judged it nece&s;&s;ary, under the &s;ituation of things here, to call a council of general officers to con&s;ult of &s;uch mea&s;ures as might be expedient to be taken at this inter|e&s;ting conjuncture of affairs. A copy of the proceedings I have the honour to inclo&s;e you.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the opinion of the council, I &s;hall detach the rifle regiment to-morrow, under the command of brig|adier-general Sullivan, with orders to repair to New-York with all po&s;&s;ible expedition;&mdash;which will be &s;uc|ceeded, the day after, by the other five in one brigade,&mdash;they being all that it was thought advi&s;eable to &s;end from hence till the enemy &s;hall have quitted the town. Imme|diately upon their departure, I &s;hall &s;end forward major-general Putnam, and follow my&s;elf with the remainder of the army as &s;oon as I have it in my power,&mdash;leaving here &s;uch a number of men as circum&s;tances may &s;eem to require.</P>
<P>As the badne&s;s of the roads at this &s;ea&s;on will greatly retard the march of our men, I have, by advice of the gen|eral officers, wrote to governor Trumbull by this expre&s;s, to u&s;e his utmo&s;t exertions for throwing a reinforcement, of two thou&s;and men into New-York, from the we&s;tern parts of Connecticut,&mdash;and to the commanding officer there, to apply to the provincial convention or committee of &s;afety of New-Jer&s;ey, for a thou&s;and more for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, to oppo&s;e the enemy and prevent their getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in ca&s;e they arrive before the troops from hence can get there; of which there is a probability, unle&s;s they are impeded by contrary winds. This mea&s;ure, though it may be attended with con&s;iderable expen&s;e, I flatter my&s;elf, will meet with the approbation of Congre&s;s. Pa&s;t experience, and the lines in Bo&s;ton and on Bo&s;ton neck, point out the propriety, and &s;ugge&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of keep|ing
<PB N="105" REF="029737_0104_0FE247DD946A8830">
our enemies from gaining po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and making a lodgement.</P>
<P>Should their de&s;tination be further &s;outhward, or for Halifax (as reported in Bo&s;ton) for the purpo&s;e of going into Canada,&mdash;the march of our troops to New-York will place them nearer the &s;cene of action, and more convenie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> for affording &s;uccours.</P>
<P>We have not taken po&s;t on Nuke-hill, and fortified it, as mentioned that we &s;hould, in my la&s;t. On hearing that the enemy were about to retreat and leave the town, it was thought imprudent and unadvi&s;eable to force them with too much precipitation, that we might gain a little time, and prepare for a march. To-morrow evening we &s;hall take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s they are gone.</P>
<P>As New-York is of &s;uch importance, prudence and policy require that every precaution that can be devi&s;ed &s;hould be adopted, to fru&s;trate the de&s;igns which the ene|my have of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it. To this end I have ordered ve&s;|&s;els to be provided and held ready at Norwich, for the embarkation and tran&s;portation of our troops thither. This I have done with a view not only of greatly expedit|ing their arrival, (as it will &s;ave &s;everal days marching) but al&s;o that they may be fre&s;h and &s;it for intrenching and throwing up works of defence as &s;oon as they get there, if they do not meet the enemy to contend with:&mdash;for nei|ther of which would they be in a proper condition after a long and fatiguing march in bad roads. If Wallace, with his &s;hips, &s;hould be appri&s;ed of the mea&s;ure, and at|tempt to prevent it by &s;topping up the harbour of New-London, they can but pur&s;ue their march by land.</P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve that it is the opinion of the general officers, if the enemy abandon the town, that it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to employ or keep any part of this ar|my for its defence; and that I have mentioned, on that event's happening, I &s;hall immediately repair to New-York with the remainder of the army not now detached, leaving only &s;uch a number of men here as circum&s;tances may &s;eem to require. What I partly allude to, is, that, as it will take a con&s;iderable time for the removal of &s;uch a body of men, and the divi&s;ions mu&s;t precede each other in &s;uch order as to allow intermediate time &s;ufficient for
<PB N="106" REF="029737_0105_0FE24788B4039510">
them to be covered and provided for, and many things done previous to the march of the whole, for &s;ecuring and forwarding &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as cannot be immediately car|ried, and others which it may be proper to keep here,&mdash;that directions might be received from Congre&s;s re&s;pecting the &s;ame, and as many men ordered to remain for that and other purpo&s;es, as they may judge proper. I could wi&s;h to have their commands upon the &s;ubject, and in time; as I may be under &s;ome degree of embarra&s;&s;ment as to their views.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s having been plea&s;ed to appoint colonel Thomp&s;on a brigadier-general, there is a vacancy for a colonel in the regiment he commanded, to which I would beg leave to recommend the lieutenant-colonel Hand. I &s;hall al&s;o take the liberty of recommending captain Hugh Stephen&s;on, of the Virginia riflemen, to &s;ucceed colonel Hand, and to be appointed in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as lieuten|ant-colonel,&mdash;there being no major to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">egiment &s;ince the promotion of major Magaw to be lieutenant-colonel of one of the Penn&s;ylvania battalions, and who is gone from hence. He is, in my opinion, the fitte&s;t per&s;on in this army for it, as well as the olde&s;t captain in the &s;ervice, having di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf at the head of a rifle company all the la&s;t war, and highly merited the approbation of his &s;uperior officers.</P>
<P>Colonel Mifflin informed me to-day of his having re|ceived tent-cloths from Mr. Barrell, of Philadelphia, to the amount of &s;even thou&s;and five hundred pounds Penn|&s;ylvania currency, and applied for a warrant for payment of it. But, as our fund is low, and many nece&s;&s;ary de|mands again&s;t it which mu&s;t be &s;atisfied,&mdash;and our calls for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oney are and will be exceedingly great,&mdash;I could not gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nt it, thinking it might be convenient for payment to be made in Philadelphia, by your order on the trea&s;ury there.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure I inform you, that, on Sunday la&s;t, the &s;eventeenth in&s;tant, about nine o'clock in
<PB N="107" REF="029737_0106_0FE247DF188C5CE0">
the forenoon, the mini&s;terial army evacuated the town of Bo&s;ton, and that the forces of the United Colonies are now in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof. I beg leave to congratu|late you, Sir, and the honorable Congre&s;s, on this happy event, and particularly as it was effected without endanger|ing the lives and property of the remaining unhappy inhab|itants.</P>
<P>I have great rea&s;on to imagine their flight was precipitat|ed by the appearance of a work which I had ordered to be thrown up la&s;t Saturday night on an eminence at Dorche&s;|ter which lay neare&s;t to Bo&s;ton neck, called Nuke-hill.</P>
<P>The town, although it has &s;uffered greatly, is not in &s;o bad a &s;tate as I expected to find it; and I have a particu|lar plea&s;ure in being able to inform you, Sir, that your hou&s;e has received no damage worth mentioning. Your furniture is in tolerable order, and the family pictures are all left en|tire and untouched. Captain Cazneau takes charge of the whole, until he &s;hall receive further orders from you.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the mini&s;terial troops had quitted the town, I ordered a thou&s;and men, (who had had the &s;mall-pox) under command of general Putnam, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights, which I &s;hall endeavour to fortify in &s;uch a man|ner as to prevent their return, &s;hould they attempt it. But, as they are &s;till in the harbour, I thought it not prudent to march off with the main body of the army until I &s;hould be fully &s;atisfied they had quitted the coa&s;t. I have there|fore only detached five regiments, be&s;ides the rifle battal|ion, to New-York, and &s;hall keep the remainder here till all &s;u&s;picion of their return cea&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation in which I found their works evidently di&s;covered that their retreat was made with the greate&s;t precipitation. They have left their barracks and other works of wood at Bunker's hill, &amp;c. all &s;tanding, and have de&s;troyed but a &s;mall part of their lines. They have al&s;o left a number o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine pieces of cannon, which they fir&s;t &s;piked up, al&s;o a very large iron mortar; and, as I am in|formed, they have thrown another over the end of your wharf. I have employed proper per&s;ons to drill the can|non, and doubt not I &s;hall &s;ave the mo&s;t of them.&mdash;I am not yet able to procure an exact li&s;t of all the &s;tores they have left.

<P>Part of the powder mentioned in yours of the &s;ixth in|&s;tant has already arrived. The remainder I have ordered to be &s;topped on the road, as we &s;hall have no occa&s;ion for it here. The letter to general Thomas, I immediately &s;ent to him. He de&s;ired leave for three or four days, to &s;ettle &s;ome of his private affairs; after which, he will &s;et out for his command in Canada.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the honour to addre&s;s you on the nineteenth in&s;tant upon the evacuation of the town of Bo&s;|ton by the mini&s;terial army, I fully expected, as their re|treat and embarkation were hurried and precipitate, that, before now, they would have departed the harbour, and been far in their pa&s;&s;age to the place of de&s;tination. But, to my &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;appointment, the fleet is &s;till in Nanta&s;|ket-road. The purpo&s;e inducing their &s;tay is altogether unknown; nor can I &s;ugge&s;t any &s;atisfactory rea&s;on for it. On Wedne&s;day night la&s;t, before the whole of the fleet fell down to Nanta&s;ket, they demoli&s;hed the ca&s;tle and hou&s;es belonging to it, by burning them down, and the &s;everal for|tifications. They left a great number of the cannon, but have rendered all of them, except a very few, entirely u&s;e|le&s;s, by breaking off the trunnions; and tho&s;e they &s;piked up: but they may be made &s;erviceable again:&mdash;&s;ome are already done.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal ve&s;&s;els in the docks, which were taken by the enemy (&s;ome with and others without cargoes,) which different per&s;ons claim as their property and right. Are they to be re&s;tored to their former owners on making proof of their title, or to belong to the continent, as captures made from the enemy?&mdash;I wi&s;h Congre&s;s would direct a mode of proceeding again&s;t them, and e&s;tabli&s;h a rule for
<PB N="109" REF="029737_0108_0FE247E0B868CBC0">
deci&s;ion: they appear to me to be highly nece&s;&s;ary. In like manner, &s;ome of the cannon which are in Bo&s;ton are &s;aid to have come from the ca&s;tle. Suppo&s;ing them, with tho&s;e remaining at the ca&s;tle, to have been purcha&s;ed by and pro|vided originally at the expen&s;e of this province,&mdash;are they now to be con&s;idered as belonging to it, or to the public? I beg leave to refer the matter to the opinion of Congre&s;s, and pray their direction how I am to conduct re&s;pecting them.</P>
<P>It having been &s;ugge&s;ted to me that there was con&s;ider|able property, &amp;c. belonging to per&s;ons who had, from the fir&s;t of the pre&s;ent unhappy conte&s;t, manife&s;ted an unfriend|ly and invetera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e di&s;po&s;ition, in the town of Bo&s;ton, I thought it prudent to write to the honourable General Court upon the &s;ubject, that it might be inquired after and &s;ecured. A copy of the letter I herewith &s;end you, and &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s, through you, whether they will not determine how it is to be di&s;po&s;ed of, and as to the appropriation of the money ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the town was abandoned by the enemy, I judged it advi&s;eable to &s;ecure the &s;everal heights, le&s;t they &s;hould attempt to return: and, for this purpo&s;e, have cau&s;|ed a large and &s;trong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> be thrown up on Fort-hill, a po&s;t of great importance, as it commands the whole harbour, and, when fortified, if properly &s;upported, will greatly an|noy any fleet the enemy may &s;end again&s;t the town, and render the landing of their troops exceedingly difficult, if not impracticable. This work is almo&s;t done, and in a little time will be complete: and, that the communication between the town and country may be free and open, I have ordered all the lines upon the neck to be immediately de|&s;troyed, and the other works on the &s;ides of the town facing the country, that the inhabitants from the latter may not be impeded, and afforded an ea&s;y entrance, in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at any future time. The&s;e matters I conceived to be within the line of my duty; of which I advi&s;ed the General Court, and recommended to their attention &s;uch other mea&s;ures as they might think nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ecuring the town again&s;t the ho&s;tile de&s;igns of the enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="029737_0109_0FE2478BC49FE620">
I have ju&s;t got an inventory of &s;tores and property be|longing to the crown, which the enemy left in Bo&s;ton, at the ca&s;tle, and Bunker's-hill,&mdash;which I have the honour to tran&s;mit you; and &s;hall give &s;trict orders that a careful attention be had to any more that may be found. I &s;hall take &s;uch precautions re&s;pecting them, that they may be &s;e|cure, and turn to the public advantage, as much as po&s;&s;ible, or circum&s;tances will admit of.</P>
<P>A Mr. Bulfinch from Bo&s;ton, who acted as clerk to Mr. * * *, having put into my hands a li&s;t of rations drawn the Saturday before the troops evacuated the town, I have inclo&s;ed it for your in&s;pection. He &s;ays, neither the &s;taff officers nor women are included in the li&s;t; from which it appears that their number is greater than we had an idea of.</P>
<P>Major-general Ward and brigadier-general Frye are de|&s;irous of leaving the &s;ervice; and, for that purpo&s;e, have reque&s;ted me to lay the matter before Congre&s;s, that they may be allowed to re&s;ign their commi&s;&s;ions. The papers containing their applications you will herewith receive. They will give you a full and more particular information upon the &s;ubject; and therefore I &s;hall take the liberty of referring you to them.</P>
<P>I would mention to Congre&s;s that the commi&s;&s;ary of artillery &s;tores has informed me, that whatever powder has been &s;ent to this camp has always come without any bill a&s;certaining the number of ca&s;ks or quantity. This, it is probable, has proceeded from forgetfulne&s;s or inattention in the per&s;ons appointed to &s;end it, or the negligence of tho&s;e who brought it, though they have declared otherwi&s;e, and that they never had any. As it may in &s;ome mea&s;ure prevent embezzlements, (though I do not &s;u&s;pect any to have been made) and the commi&s;&s;ary will know what and how much to receive, and be enabled to di&s;cover mi&s;takes if any &s;hould happen,&mdash;I &s;hould be glad if you will direct a bill of parcels to be always &s;ent in future.</P>
<P>There have been &s;o many accounts from England, all agreeing that commi&s;&s;ioners are coming to America, to propo&s;e terms for an accommodation, as they &s;ay,&mdash;that I am inclined to think the time of their arrival not very far off. If they come to Bo&s;ton, (which probably will be the
<PB N="111" REF="029737_0110_0FE247EB0E3D7E18">
ca&s;e if they come to America at all) I &s;hall be under much embarra&s;&s;ment re&s;pecting the manner of receiving them, and the mode of treatment that ought to be u&s;ed. I there|fore pray that Congre&s;s will give me directions, and point out the line of conduct to be pur&s;ued&mdash;whether they are to be con&s;idered as amba&s;&s;adors, and to have a pa&s;s or per|mit for repairing through the country to Philadelphia or to any other place&mdash;or whether they are to be re&s;trained in any and what manner. I &s;hall anxiou&s;ly wait their orders, and, whatever they are, comply with them literally.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED your favour of the eleventh in&s;tant by Saturday night's po&s;t, and mu&s;t beg pardon for not ac|knowledging it in my la&s;t of the twenty-fourth. The hur|ry I was then in occa&s;ioned the neglect, and I hope will apologize for it.</P>
<P>I now beg leave to inform you that I have ju&s;t received intelligence, that the whole of the mini&s;terial fleet, be&s;ides three or four &s;hips, got under way this evening at Nanta&s;|ket-road, and were &s;tanding out for &s;ea: in con&s;equence of which, I &s;hall detach a brigade of &s;ix regiments immedi|ately from hence for New-York, under the command of brigadier-general Sullivan (brigadier-general Heath having gone with the fir&s;t) which will be &s;ucceeded by another in a day or two; and directly after, I &s;hall forward the re|mainder of the army (except four or five regiments which will be left for taking care of the barracks and public &s;tores, and fortifying the town, and erecting &s;uch works for its defence as the honourable General Court may think nece&s;|&s;ary)&mdash;and follow my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Apprehending that general Thomas will &s;tand in need of &s;ome artilleri&s;ts in Canada, I have ordered two com|panies of the train to march immediately; and two mor|tars, with a quantity of &s;hells and &s;hot, to be &s;ent him. He &s;et out on the twenty-fir&s;t in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed you have a copy of the return of ordnance &s;tores left in Bo&s;ton by the enemy. In it are not included
<PB N="112" REF="029737_0111_0FE247945C0E5B98">
the cannon left at the ca&s;tle, amounting to a hundred and thirty-five pieces, as reported, all of which, except a very few, they have de&s;troyed and rendered u&s;ele&s;s, by knock|ing off the trunnions, and &s;piking up.</P>
<P>I beg leave to tran&s;mit you the copy of a petition from the inhabitants of Nova-Scotia, brought me by * * *, e&s;|quire, mentioned therein, who is now here with an Acadian. From this it appears they are in a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation; and, from Mr. * * *'s account, are exceedingly apprehen&s;ive that they will be reduced to the di&s;agreeable alternative of taking up arms and joining our enemies, or to flee their country, unle&s;s they can be protected again&s;t their in&s;ults and oppre&s;&s;ions. He &s;ays that their committees think ma|ny &s;alutary and valuable con&s;equences would be derived from five or &s;ix hundred men being &s;ent there, as it would not only quiet the minds of the people from the anxiety and unea&s;ine&s;s they are now filled with, and enable them to take a part in behalf of the colonies, but be the means of preventing the Indians (of whom there are a good many) from taking the &s;ide of government, and the mini&s;terial troops from getting &s;uch &s;upplies of provi&s;ions from thence as they have done.</P>
<P>How far the&s;e good purpo&s;es would be an&s;wered if &s;uch a force was &s;ent as they a&s;k for, is impo&s;&s;ible to determine in the pre&s;ent uncertain &s;tate of things. For, if the army from Bo&s;ton is going to Halifax (as reported by them be|fore their departure) that or a much more con&s;iderable force would be of no avail: if not, and they po&s;&s;e&s;s the friendly di&s;po&s;ition to our cau&s;e, &s;ugge&s;ted in the petition and declared by Mr. * * *, it might be of great &s;ervice, unle&s;s another body of troops &s;hould be &s;ent thither by ad|mini&s;tration, too powerful for them to oppo&s;e. It being a matter of &s;ome importance, I judged it prudent to lay it before Congre&s;s for their con&s;ideration; and reque&s;ting their direction upon the &s;ubject, &s;hall only add, if they de|termine to adopt it, that they will pre&s;cribe the number to be &s;ent, and whether it is to be from the regiments which will be left here.

<P>THIS letter will be delivered you by * * *, e&s;quire, the gentleman from Nova-Scotia whom I mentioned to you in mine of the twenty-&s;eventh ultimo. He &s;eemed de&s;ir|ous of waiting on the honourable Congre&s;s, in order to lay before them the &s;tate of public affairs, and &s;ituation of the inhabitants of that province. And, as it might be in his power to communicate many things per&s;onally which could not be &s;o well done by letter, I encouraged him in his de|&s;ign, and have advanced him fifty dollars to defray his ex|pen&s;es. The Acadian accompanies him: and, as they &s;eem to be &s;olid judicious men, I beg leave to recommend them both to the notice of Congre&s;s;&mdash;and am mo&s;t re|&s;pectfully, Sir, your mo&s;t obedient, &amp;c.</P>

<P>AN expre&s;s arrived this morning with a letter from governor Cooke of Rhode-I&s;land, of which the inclo&s;ed is a copy. In con&s;equence of this important intelligence, I immediately di&s;patched an expre&s;s after general Sullivan who is on his march to Norwich with &s;ix regiments, and ordered him to file off to Providence, if he &s;hould be &s;o de&s;ired by governor Cooke, to whom I have wrote on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>General Greene was to have marched this morning with five more regiments, by way of Providence. I have order|ed him to ha&s;ten his march for that place; and hope to collect a force there, &s;ufficient to prevent the enemy from effecting their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Whether this movement be only a feint to draw our at|tention from their principal object, or not, is at pre&s;ent im|po&s;&s;ible to determine. I momently expect further intel|ligence from governor Cooke. If the alarm &s;hould be well grounded, I &s;hall ha&s;ten to Providence, and make the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;po&s;itions for their reception. I beg you to a&s;|&s;ure the honourable Congre&s;s I &s;hall exert my&s;elf to the at|mo&s;t to fru&s;trate the de&s;igns of the enemy.</P>

<P>I WAS honoured with your favours of the twenty-fir&s;t and twenty-fifth ultimo, on the &s;econd in&s;tant,&mdash;the former by Mr. Han&s;on, &amp;c. the latter by Fe&s;&s;enden. I heartily wi&s;h the money had arrived &s;ooner, that the militia might have been paid as &s;oon as their time of &s;ervice ex|pired. The di&s;appointment has given them great unea&s;i|ne&s;s, and they are gone home much di&s;&s;atisfied: nor have I been without &s;evere complaints from the other troops on the &s;ame account. When I get to New-York, I hope a &s;ufficient &s;um will be there, ready to pay every claim.</P>
<P>It is not in my power to make report of the deficie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of arms in compliance with the direction of Congre&s;s at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> time, as &s;ome of the regiments are at, and mo&s;t of the oth|ers on their march to New-York; nor do I know that is would an&s;wer any good purpo&s;e, if it were,&mdash;having made repeated applications to the &s;everal a&s;&s;emblies and conven|tions upon the &s;ubject, and con&s;tantly received for an&s;wer, that they could afford no relief.</P>
<P>When I arrive at New-York, I &s;hall, in pur&s;uance of the order of Congre&s;s, detach four battalions to Canada, if the &s;ituation of affairs will admit of it; and &s;hall be ex|tremely happy if they and the troops already there can ef|fect the important end of their going.</P>
<P>In my letter of the fir&s;t in&s;tant, per po&s;t, I inclo&s;ed you a copy of a letter from governor Cooke, advi&s;ing me of the arrival of a &s;hip of war, &amp;c. at and near the harbour of Newport. I have now the plea&s;ure to inform you that the report was entirely premature, and without any foundation. You have a copy of his letter of the fir&s;t in&s;tant to this effect. I wi&s;h the alarm had never been given: it occa&s;ioned general Sullivan and his brigade to make an unnece&s;&s;ary and inconvenient diver&s;ion from their route.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed is a copy of an account, pre&s;ented by the honourable General Court, of powder furni&s;hed the conti|nental army by this colony. From the account, it ap|pears that part of it was &s;upplied before the army was un|der my command; and therefore I know nothing of it; but have not the &s;malle&s;t doubt of the ju&s;tice of the charge.
<PB N="115" REF="029737_0114_0FE247EE51FBAEF8">
I &s;hall leave about two hundred barrels of this article with major-general Ward, out of which Congre&s;s will direct him to make a return, if they think proper,&mdash;and al&s;o repayment of what may have been furni&s;hed by the other governments.</P>
<P>A proclamation of general Howe's, i&s;&s;ued a few days before his departure from town, having fallen into my hands, I have inclo&s;ed you a copy, which may probably have been the occa&s;ion of large quantities of goods being carried away, and the removal of many per&s;ons, which otherwi&s;e would not have happened.</P>
<P>Colonel Warren, pay-ma&s;ter-general, finding the army likely to be removed from hence, informed me the other day that the &s;ituation of his affairs and engagements in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the colony are &s;uch, as to prevent him from per&s;onally attending the army; and offered, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be required, to re&s;ign. This was rather embarra&s;|&s;ing. To me it appears indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary that the pay-ma&s;ter-general, with his books, &s;hould be at or near head-quarters. Indeed it is u&s;ual for the head of every department in the army, however di&s;per&s;ed tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> army may be, to be with the commanding general, keeping deputies in the &s;maller departments. On the other hand, colonel Warren's merit and attachment to the cau&s;e are &s;uch, that I could do nothing le&s;s than de&s;ire, (as &s;ome money mu&s;t be left for the pay and contingent charges of the army which will remain here) he would wait here till Congre&s;s &s;hall be plea&s;ed to give their &s;entiments upon the matter&mdash;&s;ending in the mean time &s;ome per&s;on in whom he could confide, with the money, but little of which there will be to carry, though great the demands, as nine of the regi|ments which have marched to New-York have only re|ceived five hundred pounds each, towards their pay for the months of February and March&mdash;and &s;ix others, not a farthing. I hope therefore this matter will be con&s;ider|ed by Congre&s;s, and the re&s;ult tran&s;mitted me as &s;oon as done.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o mention to Congre&s;s, that the militia regi|ments which were la&s;t called upon, in making up their ab|&s;tracts, charged pay&mdash;the officers, from the time they re|ceived orders to rai&s;e companies&mdash;and the privates, from
<PB N="116" REF="029737_0115_0FE24797CD41A570">
the time they re&s;pectively engaged to come or were call|ed upon, though they did not march for a con&s;iderable time after&mdash;&s;ome not within three, four, to twenty days, during all which, they remained at home about their own private affairs, without doing any thing el&s;e than "prepar|ing for the march," as they &s;ay by way of plea. This appeared to me &s;o exceedingly unrea&s;onable, and &s;o con|trary to ju&s;tice, that the public &s;hould pay for a longer time than from the day of their march to that of their return, that I ordered the ab&s;tracts to be made out accordingly, and refu&s;ed to give warrants on any other terms. They &s;ay that the enli&s;ting orders, which went out from their governments, give them the pay they claim. The fact may be that &s;omething in the&s;e may &s;eem to authorize it: but I mu&s;t &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s, and wi&s;h for their deci|&s;ion, whether the continent mu&s;t pay it.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to inform you that on the fourth in&s;tant I &s;et out from Cambridge, and arrived here on Saturday la&s;t. I came through Providence, Norwich, and New-London, in order to &s;ee and expedite the embarkation of the troops. The third brigade, under the command of general Greene, was at New-London when I left it, where there was a &s;ufficient number of tran&s;ports to embark them&mdash;and mo&s;t probably would have arrived here before this, had it not been for a &s;evere &s;torm which happened the night they &s;ailed, which di&s;per&s;ed them, and, I fear, has done them &s;ome injury.</P>
<P>General Spencer, with the la&s;t brigade, marched from Roxbury the day I left Cambridge, and would be at New-London, ready to embark in the return tran&s;ports which brought general Sullivan's divi&s;ion to this place. The whole of the troops may be rea&s;onably expected here in the cour&s;e of this week. The badne&s;s of the roads, and difficulty of procuring teams for bringing the &s;tores, bag|gage, &amp;c. have greatly prolonged their arrival at this place.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="029737_0116_0FE247F0DD4291F0">
I have not had time, &s;ince I came, to look fully about me; but find many works of defence begun, and &s;ome fini&s;hed. The troops are much di&s;per&s;ed&mdash;&s;ome on Long-I&s;land, others on Staten-I&s;land, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I have ordered four battalions from hence to Canada, and am taking mea&s;ures to have them forwarded to Albany, by water, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. This will greatly expedite their arrival, and ea&s;e the men of much fatigue. I have wrote general Schuyler of their coming, that he may have nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures taken to hurry their march to general Thomas.</P>
<P>I am informed by general Putnam that the militia, that were called in for the &s;upport of this town in ca&s;e the mini&s;terial army had arrived before our troops, are all di&s;|charged, it being unnece&s;&s;ary to keep them longer.</P>
<P>All the &s;hips of war, be&s;ides the A&s;ia moved out of this harbour on Saturday, and the A&s;ia ye&s;terday; &s;ome of which are now below the Narrows, and the re&s;t gone to &s;ea.</P>
<P>Your favour of the tenth in&s;tant, by major Sherburne, directed to general Putnam or the commanding officer here, came to hand on Saturday evening, with three boxes of money, which I &s;hall deliver the pay-ma&s;ter as &s;oon as he arrives, and tran&s;mit you his receipt for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Having received information from hence before my de|parture from Camb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">dge, that thirty pieces of heavy can|non were wanting, and e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of this place, in addition to tho&s;e already here&mdash;I took the liberty of applying to admiral Hopkins, whom I &s;aw at New-London, for that number, with the mortars and &s;tores he brought from Providence,&mdash;a li&s;t of which he had tran&s;mitted you. He told me, that, as many were wanting for the defence of Providence river and the harbour at New-London, it was uncertain whether I could have all I wanted; but that he would &s;end me all that could be &s;pared.</P>
<P>I have not been able to get a return of the troops &s;ince I came:&mdash;as &s;oon as I do, I will &s;end it you.</P>

<P>I HAVE this moment received a letter from gen|eral Schuyler, containing inclo&s;ures of a very important nature, copies of which, I imagine, are contained in the inclo&s;ed letter to you, which I thought it my duty imme|diately to forward by expre&s;s, that they may be laid before the honourable Congre&s;s, and proper mea&s;ures pur&s;ued to prevent the fatal effects which are therein apprehended. For my own part, I have done my utmo&s;t to forward the four
<PB N="119" REF="029737_0118_0FE247F9EC266228">
regiments ordered by Congre&s;s: but a variety of incidents have hitherto con&s;pired to prevent their embarkation. The men had &s;carcely recovered them&s;elves from the fa|tigues of their march from Bo&s;ton, and are quite unpro|vided with nece&s;&s;aries. The colonels of the regiments, though repeatedly called upon for that purpo&s;e, had neg|lected making out the ab&s;tracts for their pay. All ob&s;ta|cles however are now removed; and I hope to begin the embarkation this day. Indeed it would have been be&s;t, in my opinion, to have &s;ent the regiments, rai&s;ed in this province and New-Jer&s;ey, upon that &s;ervice, had not the peculiar circum&s;tances under which they were rai&s;ed pre|vented it. By the terms of their enli&s;tment, they are to &s;erve during the war, and at five dollars per month, on condition (as I am informed) that they &s;hall not be &s;ent out of tho&s;e provinces. Be&s;ides, they are very ill provid|ed with arms, &s;ome companies not having any. It mu&s;t be a great burden upon the continent to keep &s;uch a num|ber of u&s;ele&s;s men in pay: and yet, if they &s;hould be di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, and an unexpected &s;upply of arms &s;hould arrive, it may be found very difficult to replace them.</P>
<P>The officers of the &s;everal corps that have arrived here have been &s;o bu&s;ily employed in fixing their men in quar|ters, that I have not yet been able to procure an exact return of their numbers. Some are yet behind. As &s;oon as the whole are collected, I &s;hall order the proper returns, and tran&s;mit them to Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to notice what colonel Hazen &s;ays of the di&s;po&s;ition of the Indians. In my opinion, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to keep them in a &s;tate of neutrality. They mu&s;t, and, no doubt, &s;oon will take an active part either for or again&s;t us: and I &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, whether it would not be be&s;t immediately to engage them on our &s;ide, and to u&s;e our utmo&s;t endeav|ours to prevent their minds being poi&s;oned by mini&s;terial emi&s;&s;aries, which will ever be the ca&s;e while a king's gar|ri&s;on is &s;uffered to remain in their country. Would it not therefore be advi&s;eable to &s;end a &s;ufficient force from the back counties of Penn&s;ylvania, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the garri&s;ons of Niagara and Detroit? This, I think, might ea&s;ily be effected, and would an&s;wer the mo&s;t &s;alutary

purpo&s;es. The Seneca Indians, who have hitherto ap|peared friendly to us, might be u&s;efully employed in this bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I am in hopes mo&s;t of the difficulties mentioned in colonel Hazen's letter will be obviated by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he appearance of the re&s;pectable committee of Congre&s;s in Canada, and the forces that have been and will be &s;ent there.

<P>The honourable Congre&s;s will be able to judge from the papers &s;ent them by general Schuyler, and the in|formation they may receive of the de&s;igns of the enemy, whether it is expedient to &s;end a further reinforcement to Canada.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this day honoured with the receipt of your favour of the twentieth in&s;tant. I have now the plea&s;ure to acquaint you that the four regiments de&s;igned for Can|ada embarked ye&s;terday with a fair wind for Albany, un|der the command of colonels Greaton, Patter&s;on, Bond, and Poor; be&s;ides which there was a company of riflemen, a company of artificers, and two engineers,&mdash;the whole commanded by brigadier-general Thomp&s;on.</P>
<P>I have repeatedly mentioned to the honourable Con|gre&s;s the di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation we are in for want of arms. With much pains and difficulty I got mo&s;t of the regi|ments from the ea&s;tward tolerably well furni&s;hed; but find the York regiments very badly provided. Colonel Ritze|ma's
<PB N="121" REF="029737_0120_0FE247FB91BD59F0">
has &s;carcely any: and yet the&s;e men, being enli&s;ted during the war, and at five dollars per month, ought not (in my judgment) to be di&s;charged; as we find it almo&s;t as difficult to get men, as arms. This is a matter of &s;ome importance, which I &s;hould be glad to receive the particu|lar opinion of Congre&s;s upon.</P>
<P>Mr. Baldwin is one of the a&s;&s;i&s;tant engineers ordered to Canada. He is indeed a very u&s;eful man in his department, but declined the &s;ervice on account of his pay, which he &s;ays is inadequate to his &s;upport. In order to induce him to continue, I promi&s;ed to repre&s;ent his ca&s;e to Congre&s;s; and would recommend an increa&s;e of his pay, and that he &s;hould have the rank of lieutenant-colonel, of which he is very de&s;erving. I beg leave therefore to recommend him to the Congre&s;s, and that they would make provi&s;ion for him accordingly.</P>
<P>A few days ago, application was made to me by the com|mittee of &s;afety for this colony, for an exchange of pri&s;on|ers. For the particulars I beg leave to refer you to their letter, a copy of which you have inclo&s;ed. As there is a &s;tanding order of Congre&s;s that no &s;ailors or &s;oldiers &s;hall be exchanged for citizens, I did not incline to comply with the reque&s;t without the particular direction of Congre&s;s: but I have been &s;ince informed that the pri&s;oners, mention|ed in the committee's letter as citizens, are really &s;eamen taken from private ve&s;&s;els, but not in arms. How far this may alter the ca&s;e, or how far the rea&s;ons which induc|ed the Congre&s;s to pa&s;s the re&s;olve above-mentioned may &s;till exi&s;t, mu&s;t be left to their determination.</P>
<P>The militia, who, on my application, were ordered to this place to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion until I &s;hould arrive with the continental forces, were obliged to return home without their pay, as there was not then money &s;ufficient in the trea&s;ury for that purpo&s;e, and to an&s;wer the exigencies of the army. This occa&s;ioned great unea&s;ine&s;s among them, and may be attended with very bad con&s;equences in ca&s;e we &s;hould have occa&s;ion for their &s;ervice on any future emergency. I therefore beg the Congre&s;s would make pro|vi&s;ion for their pay, and point out particularly whether it is to be done by the commander of the continental forces,
<PB N="122" REF="029737_0121_0FE247A40F2F4888">
or by the provincial a&s;&s;emblies or conventions from whence they are &s;ent.</P>
<P>As the time for which the riflemen enli&s;ted will expire on the fir&s;t of July next, and as the lo&s;s of &s;uch a valuable and brave body of men will be of great, injury to the &s;ervice, I would &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, whether it would not be be&s;t to adopt &s;ome method to induce them to continue. They are indeed a very u&s;eful corps: but I need not mention this, as their importance is already well known to the Congre&s;s. It is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould pay an early attention to this matter, as we know from pa&s;t ex|perience that men are very &s;low in re-enli&s;ting.</P>
<P>When I had the honour of &s;eeing admiral Hopkins at New-London, he repre&s;ented to me the weak &s;tate of his fleet, occa&s;ioned by &s;ickne&s;s and the damage he received in his engagement with the enemy; and reque&s;ted I would &s;pare him two hundred men to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in a de&s;ign he had formed of attacking Wallace. This I readily con&s;ented to; and the men are to be returned as &s;oon as the &s;ervice is performed.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h it was in my power at pre&s;ent to furni&s;h general Lee with the companies of artillery he de&s;ires. I have al|ready &s;ent two companies to Quebec; and I have not yet been able to procure a return of tho&s;e that are here. I expect colonel Knox every moment, and &s;hall then be able to determine whether any can be &s;pared from hence. Blankets we are in great want of, our&s;elves; and it was with great difficulty a few could be procured for the rifle|men that were ordered for Canada.</P>
<P>I inclo&s;e you Mr. Winthrop's receipt for two hundred thou&s;and dollars brought &s;ome time ago from Philadelphia by major Sherburne, which you will plea&s;e to deliver to the continental trea&s;urers.</P>
<P>On my arrival here, I found that Mr. Living&s;ton had been appointed by the provincial Congre&s;s a commi&s;&s;ary, to furni&s;h the continental troops &s;tationed in this city with provi&s;ions. I &s;uppo&s;e this was done becau&s;e there was no continental commi&s;&s;ary then on the &s;pot. Mr. Living&s;ton &s;till claims a right of furni&s;hing all the troops but tho&s;e lately arrived from Cambridge. Mr. Trumbull is now here: and, as I con&s;ider him as the principal in that office,
<PB N="123" REF="029737_0122_0FE247FD16A4FB58">
I &s;hould be glad to know whether any part of the conti|nental troops is to be furni&s;hed by any other than their com|mi&s;&s;ary-general. I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that to me it appears very incon&s;i&s;tent, and mu&s;t create great confu&s;ion in the accounts as well as in the contracts. I intended to have laid before Congre&s;s the amount of the rations, as &s;upplied by colonel Trumbull and Mr. Living&s;ton; and called upon tho&s;e gentlemen to furni&s;h me with a &s;eparate e&s;timate for that purpo&s;e. Colonel Trumbull has given me his, by which it appears he &s;upplies the troops at eight pence and one third per ration. I have not yet re|ceived any from Mr. Living&s;ton; but am informed his contract is at ten pence half-penny. The difference is im|men&s;e, as it will amount to no le&s;s than two hundred pounds per day, for twenty thou&s;and men. It is indeed to be con&s;idered that Mr. Living&s;ton's contract is, includ|ing every other charge; and that to Mr. Trumbull's mu&s;t be added &s;tore hire, clerks, and every other contin|gent expen&s;e. But even then it will not amount to &s;o much as Mr. Living&s;ton's, by a penny per ration, which, in the gro&s;s, will be &s;omething very con&s;iderable. I thought it my duty, without prejudice or partiality, to &s;tate the matter fairly to Congre&s;s, that they might take &s;uch order upon it as to them &s;hall &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary. I cannot however, in ju&s;tice to Mr. Trumbull, help adding that he has been indefatigable in &s;upplying the army; and I be|lieve, from his connexions in New-England, is able to do it on as good terms as any per&s;on in America.</P>
<P>The &s;everal matters contained in the foregoing, I mu&s;t beg the early attention of Congre&s;s to; and that I may be favoured with an an&s;wer as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P>IN a letter which I had the honour to receive from Congre&s;s &s;ome con&s;iderable time ago, they were plea&s;ed to a&s;k what rank aides-de-camp bore in the army? from whence I concluded that they had adverted to the extra|ordinary trouble and confinement of tho&s;e gentlemen, with
<PB N="124" REF="029737_0123_0FE247A59506F710">
a view to make them an adequate allowance. But noth|ing being &s;ince done or &s;aid of the matter, I take the lib|erty, un&s;olicited by, and unknown to my aides-de-camp, to inform your honourable body that their pay is not by any means equal to their trouble and confinement.</P>
<P>No per&s;on wi&s;hes more to &s;ave money to the public, than I do: and no per&s;on has aimed more at it. But there are &s;ome ca&s;es in which par&s;imony may be ill placed; and this I take to be one. Aides-de-camp are per&s;ons in whom entire confidence mu&s;t be placed: it requires men of abilities to execute the duties with propriety and di&s;patch, where there is &s;uch a multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s, as mu&s;t at|tend the commander-in-chief of &s;uch an army as ours&punc; and per&s;uaded I am, that nothing but the zeal of tho&s;e gentle|men (who live with me, and act in this capacity) for the great American cau&s;e, and per&s;onal attachment to me, has induced them to undergo the trouble and confinement they have experienced &s;ince they have become members of my family.</P>
<P>I give in to no kind of amu&s;ements my&s;elf; and con&s;e|quently tho&s;e about me can have none, but are confined from morning till eve, hearing and an&s;wering the applica|tions and letters of one and another, which will now, I expect, receive a pretty con&s;iderable addition, as the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the northern and ea&s;tern departments (if I continue here) mu&s;t. I &s;uppo&s;e, pa&s;s through my hands. If the&s;e gentlemen had the &s;ame relaxation from duty as other of|ficers have in their common routine, there would not be &s;o much in it. But, to have the mind always upon the &s;tretch&mdash;&s;carce ever unbent&mdash;and no hours for recreation, makes a material odds. Knowing this, and at the &s;ame time how inadequate the pay is, I can &s;carce find inclina|tion to impo&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary duties of their office upon them. To what I have here &s;aid, this further remark may be made, and is a matter of no &s;mall concernment to me, and, in its con&s;equences, to the public:&mdash;and that is, that, while the duty is hard and the pay &s;mall, it is not to be wondered at, if there &s;hould be found a promptne&s;s in them to &s;eek preferment, or in me to do ju&s;tice to them by facilitating their views; by which means I mu&s;t lo&s;e their aid when they have it mo&s;t in their power to a&s;&s;i&s;t

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED by la&s;t evening's po&s;t a letter from Jo&s;hua Wentworth, e&s;quire, of Port&s;mouth, whom I had appointed agent for our little fleet in that province. It is dated the fifteenth in&s;tant; an extract from which I have the honour of tran&s;cribing for your peru&s;al.</P>
<P>"The third in&s;tant, commodore Manly brought in the brigantine Elizabeth, one of the third divi&s;ion which &s;ailed from Nanta&s;ket, with a valuable cargo of Engli&s;h goods, and a few hog&s;heads of rum and &s;ugar, by a Mr. J * * *, who was pa&s;&s;enger, part freighter, and a very tory. Sup|po&s;e the cargo worth twenty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. Tho&s;e goods are, the greater part, owned by the late in|habitants of Bo&s;ton, and by &s;ome that were inhabitants when the troops left it,&mdash;the re&s;idue of this Mr. J * * *, and others of the &s;ame ca&s;t. The complicate &s;tate of this
<PB N="126" REF="029737_0125_0FE247A7191B71C8">
prize required my immediate &s;etting off for Bo&s;ton, ex|pecting I might find &s;ome directions for my government there; when I waited on general Ward, who was obliging enough to give me his opinion (but not able to direct, hav|ing received no in&s;tructions to the point) that the ve&s;&s;el and cargo mu&s;t be libelled, and a dividend to the captors would follow, of all &s;uch goods as might be legally claim|ed by the friends to America; and tho&s;e that were the property of them inimical, might be decreed forfeited. Upon further inquiry, I was informed a re&s;olve pa&s;&s;ed in Congre&s;s that all ve&s;&s;els and goods, retaken previous to a condemnation by a Briti&s;h court of admiralty, were liable to a partial decree (by every colony judge) to the captors, not more than one-third, nor le&s;s than one-fourth. The pre&s;ent prize falls under this re&s;olve: and any other, that [<HI>makes the</HI>] property of our internal enemies liable to a full confi&s;cation, may be nece&s;&s;ary for my government: there|fore &s;hall be much obliged by your full direction of this capture, and a copy of the continental re&s;olves thereon. This brigantine is owned by a Mr. Richard Hart, of this town, taken on her return from the We&s;t-Indies la&s;t Oc|tober, and carried into Bo&s;ton, not condemned: The rum on board are &s;eventeen hog&s;heads,&mdash;and four of &s;ugar, not removed out of her from the time of capture. The other cargo was in general &s;tolen by virtue of general Howe's proclamation (which undoubtedly you have &s;een) appointing one C * * * B * * * &s;uperintendant, who, by the way, was taken in the prize, and is now confined in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts colony, with Mr. J * * * and &s;undry others, by order of the general court, to whom general Ward delivered them.</P>
<P>"There were a &s;erjeant and twelve privates of the fourth, or king's own regiment, taken pri&s;oners on board, with the others, making &s;ixty-three &s;ouls. * * *</P>
<P>"There appeared from the pillage of this cargo by ma|ny of the pa&s;&s;engers, the property was in him who could &s;ecrete the mo&s;t. For, when examining the che&s;ts and bedding of the pri&s;oners, I found great quantity of goods that they had collected while on board, which were taken out of ware-hou&s;es without packing, and hove promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly on board the ve&s;&s;el. Even the &s;ailors had provided
<PB N="127" REF="029737_0126_0FE24806AA27BB98">
for their di&s;po&s;al at plea&s;ure. In fact, the de&s;truction of property, under cover of general Howe's proclamation, is unparell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">led. * * *</P>
<P>"I am now di&s;charging the cargo, as it is in a peri&s;hing &s;ituation; and, when &s;elected, and the regular cour&s;e pur&s;ued through the admiralty, &s;hall adverti&s;e agreeable to his Excellency's in&s;tructions to general Ward, who was obliging enough to give me an ab&s;tract.</P>
<P>"The general court of this province, finding a difficul|ty in making a code of laws for the admiralty-court, did not complete that in&s;titution their la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, when they adjourned to June; which lap&s;e of time will not admit my facilitating the di&s;po&s;al of the prizes under my care, &s;o early as I could wi&s;h, for the &s;afety of part of the intere&s;t of the Su&s;anna's cargo, viz. the porter, which I fear may be &s;poiled by lying &s;o long,&mdash;it not having equal body to that commonly imported for &s;ale;&mdash;which induces me to de&s;ire your direction for a di&s;po&s;al of that article either at private or public &s;ale."</P>
<P>That, Sir, is an exact copy of part of Mr. Went|worth's letter to Mr. Moylan. I now reque&s;t you will plea&s;e to direct me, in what manner I &s;hall in&s;truct the agent re&s;pecting the complicated cargo, and whether he may be empowered to di&s;po&s;e of the porter or any other articles on board the prizes under his care, which the de|lay of e&s;tabli&s;hing the court of admiralty may make liable to peri&s;h.</P>
<P>I have not yet heard that there has been any trial of the prizes carried into Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay. This procra&s;tina|tion is attended with very bad con&s;equences. Some of the ve&s;&s;els I had fitted out are now laid up, the crews be|ing di&s;&s;atisfied that they cannot get their prize-money. I have tired the Congre&s;s upon this &s;ubject: but the import|ance of it makes me again mention, that, if a &s;ummary way of proceeding is not re&s;olved on, it will be impo&s;&s;i|ble to get our ve&s;&s;els manned. I mu&s;t al&s;o mention to you, Sir, that captain Manly and his crew are de&s;irous to know when they may expect their part of the value of the ordnance &s;tores taken la&s;t fall. They are anxious to know what the amount may be. As the inventory of that car|go is in the hands of Congre&s;s, I would humbly &s;ubmit it
<PB N="128" REF="029737_0127_0FE247B1134F4C60">
to them, whether a valuation thereof &s;hould not be made, and the captors' dividend be remitted them as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible. It will give them &s;pirit, and encourage them to be alert in looking out for other prizes.</P>
<P>Several officers belonging to the regiments rai&s;ed in the&s;e middle colonies inform me that their men (notwith&s;tanding their agreement) begin to murmur at the di&s;tinction of pay made between them and the regiments from the ea&s;t-ward. I would be glad that the Congre&s;s would attend to this in time, le&s;t it may get to &s;uch a pitch as will make it difficult to &s;uppre&s;s. They argue that they perform the &s;ame duty, undergo the &s;ame fatigue, and receive five dol|lars, when the ea&s;tern regiments receive &s;ix dollars and two-thirds per month. For my own part, I wi&s;h they were all upon the &s;ame footing: for, if the Briti&s;h army will not face this way, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to detach a great part of our troops: in that ca&s;e, I would, for many rea|&s;ons, be &s;orry there &s;hould be any di&s;tinctions of regiments that are all in the pay of the United Colonies.</P>
<P>The deficiency of arms (in the New-York regiments e&s;|pecially) is very great. If I am rightly informed, there are &s;carce as many in colonel Ritzema's regiment as will arm one company. Can the Congre&s;s remedy this evil? If they can, there &s;hould not a moment be lo&s;t in effecting it, as our &s;trength at pre&s;ent is, in reality, on paper only. Should we think of di&s;charging tho&s;e men who are without arms, the remedy would be wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e: for, by vigorous exertions, I hope arms may be procured; and I well know that the rai&s;ing men is exceeding difficult, e&s;pecially to be engaged during the continuance of the war, which is the footing on which colonel Ritzema's regiment is engaged.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 26.&mdash;I had wrote thus far before I was hon|oured with your favour of the twenty-third in&s;tant. In obedience to the order therein contained, I have directed &s;ix regiments more for Canada, which will embark as &s;oon as ve&s;&s;els and other nece&s;&s;aries can be provided. The&s;e regiments will be commanded by general Sullivan. I &s;hall give him in&s;tructions to join the forces in that country un|der general Thomas, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to &s;ending more troops to that country, I
<PB N="129" REF="029737_0128_0FE248085D7C1498">
am really at a lo&s;s what to advi&s;e, as it is impo&s;&s;ible at pre&s;ent to know the de&s;igns of the enemy. Should they &s;end the whole force under general Howe up the river St. Lawrence, to relieve Quebec and recover Canada, the troops gone and now going will be in&s;ufficient to &s;top their progre&s;s: and &s;hould they think proper to &s;end that or an equal force this way from Great-Britain for the purpo&s;e of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing this city and &s;ecuring the navigation of Hud&s;on's river, the troops left here will not be &s;ufficient to oppo&s;e them: and yet, for any thing we know, I think it not im|probable they may attempt both,&mdash;both being of the great|e&s;t importance to them,&mdash;if they have men.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h indeed that the army in Canada &s;hould be more powerfully reinforced: at the &s;ame time I am con|&s;cious that the tru&s;ting this important po&s;t (which is now become the grand magazine of America) to the handful of men remaining here, is running too great a ri&s;k. The &s;ecuring this po&s;t and Hud&s;on's river is to us al&s;o of &s;o great importance, that I cannot at pre&s;ent advi&s;e the &s;end|ing any more troops from hence:&mdash;on the contrary, the general officers now here, whom I thought it my duty to con&s;ult, think it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to increa&s;e the army at this place with at lea&s;t ten thou&s;and men, e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered, that, from this place only, the army in Canada mu&s;t draw its &s;upplies of ammunition, provi&s;ions, and, mo&s;t probably, of men; and that all reinforcements can be &s;ent from hence much ea&s;ier than from any other place. By the inclo&s;ed return, you will fee the &s;tate of the army here, and that the number of effective men is far &s;hort of what the Congre&s;s mu&s;t have expected.</P>
<P>I have found it nece&s;&s;ary to order colonel Dayton's regiment from New-Jer&s;ey to march as one of the &s;ix to Canada: wherefore I mu&s;t recommend it to Congre&s;s to order two companies of one of the regiments &s;till in Penn|&s;ylvania to march to Cape-May, which can be done much &s;ooner: for, had this de&s;tination of that regiment not tak|en place, it would have been very inconvenient to have de|tached two companies from it to that place; as the march would (according to lord Stirling's and other accounts) have been at lea&s;t two hundred miles from Amboy, and they mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed within twenty miles of Philadelphia,
<PB N="130" REF="029737_0129_0FE247B2ECCDBA00">
there being no practicable road along the &s;ea-coa&s;t of New-Jer&s;ey for their baggage to have pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Dr. Potts, who is bearer hereof, was, I under&s;tand, ap|pointed director of the ho&s;pital for the&s;e middle colonies: but the army being removed, with the general ho&s;pital, from the ea&s;tward, does in cour&s;e &s;uper&s;ede him. He is inclined to go to Canada, where he may be very u&s;eful, if a per&s;on is not already appointed for that department. I would humbly beg leave to a&s;k the Congre&s;s whether, in all the&s;e appointments, it would not be be&s;t to have but one chief, to whom all the others &s;hould be &s;ubordinate.</P>

<P>I AM honoured with your favour of the thirtieth ul|timo, and ob&s;erve what Congre&s;s have done re&s;pecting the &s;ettlement of the payma&s;ter's accounts. This &s;eems expe|dient, as he is out of office, and, I am certain, will be at|tended with but little if any difficulty; nothing more being nece&s;&s;ary, than to compare the warrants with his debts, and the receipts he has given, with his credits. I wi&s;h every other &s;ettlement as ea&s;y, and that a committee was appoint|ed to examine and audit the accounts upon which the war|rants are founded, particularly tho&s;e of the quarter-ma&s;ter and commi&s;&s;ary generals. They are long and of high amount, con&s;i&s;ting of a variety of charges,&mdash;of cour&s;e more intricate, and will require time and an extraordinary degree of attention to adju&s;t and liquidate in a proper manner.&mdash;Upon this &s;ubject, I did my&s;elf the honour to write you a con&s;iderable time ago.</P>
<P>Having had &s;everal complaints from the officers in the ea&s;tern regiments who have been and are engaged in recruit|ing, about the expen&s;e attending it, and for which they have never yet been allowed any thing, though the officers in the&s;e governments have, as I am informed,&mdash;I &s;hall be glad to know whether the allowance of ten &s;hillings, grant|ed to the officers for every man enli&s;ted, by the re&s;olve of Congre&s;s in [<HI>January</HI>] is general and indi&s;criminate, or confined to the middle di&s;tricts. If general, mu&s;t I have
<PB N="132" REF="029737_0131_0FE247B471C8DB98">
retro&s;pect to the time of the re&s;olve, and pay for the &s;er|vices &s;ince, or only for future enli&s;tments?</P>
<P>In a letter I wrote to Congre&s;s the twenty-fifth of De|cember, I inclo&s;ed one I had received from Jacob Baily, e&s;quire, about opening a road from Newbury to Canada. I have received another of the fifteenth ultimo: and, from his account and the intelligence I have from others upon inquiry, I have no doubt of the practicability of the mea&s;|ure; and am well informed that the di&s;tance will be con|&s;iderably &s;hortened, in&s;omuch that our people going from any part of the New-England governments ea&s;tward of Connecticut-river, to Canada, or returning from thence home, will perform their march in five or &s;ix days le&s;s time than by coming or going any way now u&s;ed. Add to this, that the road may be &s;o conducted (as it is &s;aid) as to go to the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;que, from whence the water-carriage to St. John's is good, except forty odd miles,&mdash;or be carried &s;o far to the northward, as to keep clear of the Lakes altogether, and afford an ea&s;y pa&s;s into Canada at all &s;ea&s;ons. The advantage re&s;ulting from this route being &s;o great and important, I have advanced colonel Bai|ley two hundred and fifty pounds to begin with, and di|rected him to execute his plan. No doubt it will require a con&s;iderable advance to accompli&s;h it: but that will be &s;oon &s;unk. The expen&s;e &s;aved, by taking off &s;ix day's pay and provi&s;ions from the &s;oldiers returning to the ea&s;t|ern governments at the expiration of this campaign, will be almo&s;t if not more than equal to the charge incur|red in opening it. If not,&mdash;as in all probability there will be often a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;ending detachments of our troops to Canada from tho&s;e governments, and for others to return, it will &s;oon be repaid.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Schuyler, of the twenty-&s;eventh ultimo, I find general Thomp&s;on and his brigade were at Albany;&mdash;general Sullivan with the la&s;t (except three or four companies of colonel Wayne's regiment, not yet come) is embarked and gone, and probably will be &s;oon there. I am apprehen&s;ive, from general Schuyler's account, that they will not proceed with the wi&s;hed-for expedition, owing to a difficulty in getting teams and provender for cattle nece&s;|&s;ary to carry their baggage, and a &s;carcity of batteaux at
<PB N="133" REF="029737_0132_0FE2480B64B37648">
the Lakes for &s;o large a number, though he is taking the ut|mo&s;t pains to procure them. Should they be &s;topped for any time, it will be exceedingly unfortunate, as their going from hence has weakened us here much, and our army in Canada will not be &s;trengthened.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent with the la&s;t brigade &s;ixty barrels of powder, and other &s;tores and intrenching tools, a &s;upply being a&s;k|ed for; al&s;o the chain for a boom at the narrows of Rich|elieu, and the three boxes of money brought by Mr. Han|&s;on; and have wrote to general Schuyler to have the boom fixed as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. The commi&s;&s;ary too has for|warded about eight hundred barrels of pork, and is in ex|pectation of a further quantity from Connecticut, which will go on without &s;topping here.</P>
<P>As the magazine from whence the northern and ea&s;tern armies will occa&s;ionally receive &s;upplies of powder will probably be here, and our &s;tock is low and incon&s;iderable, being much reduced by the &s;ixty barrels &s;ent to Canada, I &s;hall be glad to have a quantity immediately forwarded. Our &s;tores &s;hould be great: for if the enemy make an at|tack upon the town, or attempt to go up the North-river, the expenditure will be very con&s;iderable. Money too is much wanted:&mdash;the regiments that are paid have only re|ceived to the fir&s;t of April, except tho&s;e of Penn&s;ylvania and Jer&s;ey which are gone to Canada: they are paid to the la&s;t of April. By a letter from general Ward, I find his che&s;t is ju&s;t exhau&s;ted; the money which was left with him for the payment of the five regiments at Bo&s;ton and Beverly being almo&s;t expended by large draughts in favour of the commi&s;&s;ary and quarter-ma&s;ter, and in fitting out the armed ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>I would here a&s;k a que&s;tion, to wit, whether, as Mr. Warren's commi&s;&s;ion is &s;uper&s;eded by Mr. Palfrey's ap|pointment, it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to fix upon &s;ome per&s;on to pay the troops there: or are the payments to go through his hands?&mdash;He does not incline to do any thing in the affair without the direction of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed you a return of the la&s;t brigade detached, and al&s;o of the forces remaining here. And as it is a matter of much importance to know the whole of our &s;trength from time to time, and to &s;ee it at one view, for

regulating our movements with propriety, I wi&s;h it were a direction from Congre&s;s to the commanding officers in the different di&s;tricts to make monthly returns to the command|er-in-chief of the continental army, of the &s;tate of the troops in their departments, and al&s;o of the military &s;tores. Such direction will probably make them more attentive than they otherwi&s;e would be. I could not get a return of the army in Canada all la&s;t year.</P>
<P>I beg leave to lay before Congre&s;s a copy of the pro|ceedings of a court-martial upon lieutenant * * * *, of the &s;econd regiment, and of his defence&mdash;which I &s;hould not have troubled them with, had I not conceived the court's &s;entence, upon the facts &s;tated in the proceedings, of a &s;in|gular nature, to be by no means adequate to the enormity of his offence, and to be of exceeding dangerous and per|nicious tendency. Upon the&s;e principles I thought it my duty to tran&s;mit the proceedings to them, in order that they may form &s;uch a judgment upon the facts &s;tated, as they may conceive right and ju&s;t, and advancive of the public good. At the &s;ame time I would mention to Con|gre&s;s that I think it of material con&s;equence that they &s;hould pa&s;s a re&s;olve, cutting off the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the military line from one rank to another, which is claim|ed by many upon the happening of vacancies&mdash;(upon which principle this offence &s;eems to have originated in a great mea&s;ure, and the extraordinary judgment in this in&s;tance to be founded)&mdash;declaring that no &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or promotion can take place upon any vacancy, without a continental commi&s;&s;ion giving and authori&s;ing it. It is of much con|&s;equence to check and entirely &s;uppre&s;s this opinion and claim, which is becoming too prevalent, and has an obvi|ous tendency to introduce mutiny and di&s;order;&mdash;or, if they conceive the claim good, and that it &s;hould take place, that they will declare it &s;o, that the point may be &s;ettled and known in future.</P>

<P>I HAVE &s;o often and &s;o fully communicated my want of arms to Congre&s;s, that I &s;hould not have given
<PB N="135" REF="029737_0134_0FE24814367CD658">
them the trouble of receiving another letter upon this &s;ub|ject at this time, but for the particular application of colo|nel Wayne, of Penn&s;ylvania, who has pointed out a method by which he thinks they may be obtained.</P>
<P>In the hands of the committee of &s;afety at Philadelphia, there are, according to colonel Wayne's account, not le&s;s than two or three thou&s;and &s;tand of arms for provincial u&s;e. From hence he thinks a number might b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> borrowed by Congre&s;s, provided they are replaced w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> continental arms as they are brought into the magazine in that city.

<P>To give Congre&s;s &s;ome idea of our &s;ituation with re&s;pect to arms&mdash;(and ju&s;tice to my own character requires that it &s;hould be known to them, although the world at large will form their opinion of our &s;trength from numbers, with|out attending to circum&s;tances)&mdash;it may not be ami&s;s to inclo&s;e a copy of a return which I received a few days ago from the forts in the Highlands, and add, that, by a report fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> colonel Ritzema's regiment, of the twenty-ninth ul|timo, there appeared to be only ninety-&s;even firelocks and &s;even bayonets belonging thereto; and that all the regi|ments from the ea&s;tward are deficient from twenty to fifty of the former. Four of tho&s;e companies at the fortifica|tions in the Highlands belong to colonel Clinton's regi|ment: but in what condition the re&s;idue are on account of arms, and how colonel Wynkoop's men are provided, I cannot undertake to &s;ay, but am told, mo&s;t mi&s;erably; as colonel Dayton's of New-Jer&s;ey and colonel Wayne's of Penn&s;ylvania al&s;o are. This, Sir, is a true though mel|ancholy de&s;cription of our &s;ituation. The propriety there|fore of keeping arms in &s;tore when men in actual pay are in want of them, and who (it is to be pre&s;umed) will, as they ought, bear the heat and burden of the day, is &s;ub|mitted with all due deference to the &s;uperior judgment of others.</P>
<P>I cannot, by all the inquiries I have been able to make, learn what number of arms have been taken from the to|ries, where they lie, or how they are to be got at. The
<PB N="136" REF="029737_0135_0FE247BE28255800">
committee of &s;afety for this colony have a&s;&s;ured me that no exertions of theirs &s;hall be wanting to procure arms: but our &s;ufferings in the mean while may prove fatal, as men without are in a manner u&s;ele&s;s. I have therefore thoughts of employing an agent who&s;e &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s it &s;hall be to ride through the middle and interior parts of the&s;e governments, for the purpo&s;e of buying up &s;uch arms as the inhabitants may incline to &s;ell, and are fit for u&s;e.</P>
<P>The de&s;igns of the enemy are too much behind the cur|tain for me to form any acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ate opinion of their plan of operations for the &s;ummer's campaign. We are left to wander therefore in the field of conjecture: and as no place (all its con&s;equences con&s;idered) &s;eemed of more importance in the execution of their grand plan, than po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of Hud&s;on's river, I thought it advi&s;ea|ble to remove with the continental army to this city &s;o &s;oon as the king's troops evacuated Bo&s;ton. But if Con|gre&s;s, from their knowledge, information, or belief, think it be&s;t for the general good of the &s;ervice that I &s;hould go to the northward or el&s;ewhere, they are convinced, I hope, that they have nothing more to do than &s;ignify their com|mands.</P>

<P>AT a quarter after &s;even this evening, I received by expre&s;s a letter from Thomas Cu&s;hing, e&s;quire, chairman of a committee of the honourable general court, covering one to them from the committee of Salem; copies of which I do my&s;elf the honour to lay before Congre&s;s, that they may judge of the intelligence contained therein, and direct &s;uch mea&s;ures to be taken upon the occa&s;ion as they may think proper and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your favours of the fourth and &s;eventh in&s;tant with their &s;everal inclo|&s;ures, and am exceedingly glad, that before the re&s;olution re&s;pecting lieutenant-colonel Ogden came to hand, I had ordered him to join his regiment, and had qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lled a di&s;a|greeable &s;pirit both of mutiny and de&s;ertion, which had taken place and &s;eemed to be ri&s;ing to a great degree in con&s;equence of it. In order to effect it, I had the regi|ment paraded, and ordered two more at the &s;ame time un|der arms, convinced them of their error and ill conduct, and obtained a promi&s;e for their good behaviour in future. To &s;uch of the men as had ab&s;conded I gave pardons, on their a&s;&s;urances to return to their duty again.</P>
<P>In my letter of the fifth in&s;tant which I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you, I mentioned to Congre&s;s the refractory and mutinous conduct of lieutenant * * * *, of the &s;econd regiment, and laid before them a copy of the proceedings
<PB N="138" REF="029737_0137_0FE247C0C264F210">
of a court-martial upon him, and of his defence, with a view that &s;uch mea&s;ures might be adopted as they &s;hould think adequate to his crime. I would now beg leave to inform them, that, &s;ince then, he has appeared &s;en&s;ible of his mi&s;conduct; and having made a written acknowledg|ment of his offence, and begged pardon for it, (as by the inclo&s;ed copy will appear) I thought it be&s;t to relea&s;e him from his confinement, and have ordered him to join his regiment; which I hope will meet their approbation, and render any determination, as to him, unnece&s;&s;ary;&mdash;ob|&s;erving at the &s;ame time that I have endeavoured, and, I flatter my&s;elf, not ineffectually, to &s;upport their authority, and a due &s;ubordination in the army. I have found it of importance and highly expedient to yield many points in fact, without &s;eeming to have done it&mdash;and this, to avoid bringing on a too frequent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of matters, which, in a political view, ought to be kept a little behind the cur|tain, and not be made too much the &s;ubjects of di&s;qui&s;ition. Time only can eradicate and overcome cu&s;toms and prej|udices of long &s;tanding: they mu&s;t be got the better of by &s;low and gradual advances.</P>
<P>I would here take occa&s;ion to &s;ugge&s;t to Congre&s;s (not wi&s;hing or meaning of my&s;elf to a&s;&s;ume the &s;malle&s;t degree of power in any in&s;tance) the propriety and nece&s;&s;ity of having their &s;entiments re&s;pecting the filling up the vacan|cies and i&s;&s;uing commi&s;&s;ions to officers, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e under the rank of field officers. Had I literally complied with the directions given upon this &s;ubject when I fir&s;t en|gaged in the &s;ervice, and which I conceived to be &s;uper|&s;eded by a &s;ub&s;equent re&s;olve for forming the army upon the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, I mu&s;t have employed one clerk for no other bu&s;ine&s;s than i&s;&s;uing warrants of appointment, and giving information to Congre&s;s for their confirmation or refu&s;al. It being evident from the nece&s;&s;ity of the thing, that there will be frequent changes and vacancies in office, from death and a variety of other cau&s;es, I now &s;ubmit it to them, and pray their direction whether I am to pur&s;ue that mode and all the ceremonies attending it, or to be at liberty to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll up and grant commi&s;&s;ions at once to &s;uch as may be fit and proper per&s;ons to &s;ucceed. * * *</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="029737_0138_0FE2481744E43668">
Before I have done, with the utmo&s;t deference and re|&s;pect I would beg leave to remind Congre&s;s of my former letters and applications re&s;pecting the appointment of prop|er per&s;ons to &s;uperintend and take direction of &s;uch pri&s;|oners as have already fallen and will fall into our hands in the cour&s;e of the war&mdash;being fully convinced, that, if there were per&s;ons appointed who would take the whole management of them under their care, the continent would &s;ave a con&s;iderable &s;um of money by it, and the pri&s;oners be better treated and provided with real nece&s;&s;aries than they now are;&mdash;and &s;hall take the liberty to add that it appears to me a matter of much importance, and worthy of con&s;ideration, that particular and proper places of &s;ecu|rity &s;hould be fixed on and e&s;tabli&s;hed in the interior parts of the different governments for their reception.</P>
<P>Such e&s;tabli&s;hments are agreeable to the practice and u&s;age of the Engli&s;h and other nations, and are founded on principles of nece&s;&s;ity and public utility. The advantages which will ari&s;e from them are obvious and many:&mdash;I &s;hall only mention two or three. They will tend much to prevent e&s;capes, (which are difficult to effect when the public is once adverti&s;ed that the pri&s;oners are re&s;trained to a few &s;tated and well-known places, and not permitted to go from thence,) and the more ingenious among them from di&s;&s;eminating and &s;preading their artful and per|nicious intrigues and opinions throughout the country, which would influence the weaker and wavering part of mankind, and meet with but too favourable a hearing. Further, it will be le&s;s in their power to join and a&s;&s;i&s;t our enemies in ca&s;es of inva&s;ion, and will give us an oppor|tunity always to know, from the returns of tho&s;e appoint|ed to &s;uperintend them, what number we have in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, the force &s;ufficient to check and &s;uppre&s;s their ho&s;tile views in times of emergency, and the expen&s;es nece&s;&s;ary for their maintenance and &s;upport. Many other rea&s;ons might be adduced to prove the nece&s;&s;ity and expediency of the mea&s;ure:&mdash;I &s;hall only &s;ubjoin one more, and then have done on the &s;ubject,&mdash;which is, that many of the towns where pri&s;oners have been already &s;ent, not having convenience for or the mean of keeping them, complain they are burden&s;ome; and have become carele&s;s, inat|tentive,
<PB N="140" REF="029737_0139_0FE247C24820BBF8">
and altogether indifferent whether they e&s;cape or not; and tho&s;e of them that are re&s;tricted to a clo&s;er con|finement (the limits of jail) are neglected, and not treated with that care and regard which Congre&s;s wi&s;h.</P>
<P>I have not received further intelligence of the German troops &s;ince my letter of the &s;eventh in&s;tant, covering Mr. Cu&s;hing's di&s;patches. But, le&s;t the account of their coming &s;hould be true, may it not be advi&s;eable and good policy to rai&s;e &s;ome companies of our Germans to &s;end among them when they arrive, for exciting a &s;pirit of di&s;affection and de&s;ertion?&mdash;If a few &s;en&s;ible and tru&s;ty fellows could get with them, I &s;hould think they would have great weight and influence with the common &s;oldiery, who certainly have no enmity towards us, having received no injury nor cau&s;e of quarrel from us. The mea&s;ure having oc|curred, and appearing to me expedient, I thought it pru|dent to mention it for the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Having received a letter from general Ward, advi&s;ing that Congre&s;s have accepted his re&s;ignation, and praying to be relieved,&mdash;and it being nece&s;&s;ary that a general of|ficer &s;hould be &s;ent to take the command of the troops at Bo&s;ton, e&s;pecially if the army &s;hould arrive which is talk|ed of, and which &s;ome con&s;ider as a probable event,&mdash;I mu&s;t beg leave to recommend to Congre&s;s the appoint|ment of &s;ome brigadier-generals, not having more here (nor &s;o many at this time) than are e&s;&s;ential to the gov|ernment and conducting the forces and the works that are carrying on. Generals Sullivan and Thomp&s;on being ordered to Canada, I cannot &s;pare one more general of|ficer from hence without injuring the &s;ervice greatly, and leaving the army here without a &s;ufficient number.</P>
<P>Having frequent applications from the committee of &s;afety and others, about an exchange of pri&s;oners, and not having authority to pur&s;ue any other mode in this in&s;tance, than that marked out by a re&s;olve of Congre&s;s &s;ome con|&s;iderable time ago, I hope they will pardon me when I wi&s;h them to take under con&s;ideration &s;uch parts of my letter of the twenty-&s;econd ultimo as relate to this &s;ubject; and for their determination upon it.

<P>SINCE my la&s;t of the eleventh in&s;tant which I had the honour to addre&s;s you, nothing of moment or import|ance has occurred; and the principal de&s;ign of this is to communicate to Congre&s;s the intelligence I received la&s;t night from general Schuyler by a letter of the tenth, re|&s;pecting the progre&s;s of our troops in getting towards Can|ada, not doubting of their impatience and anxiety to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">r of it and of every thing relating to the expedition. For their more particular information and &s;atisfaction, I have done my&s;elf the plea&s;ure to extract the &s;ub&s;tance of his letter on this head, which is as follows:&mdash;"that general Thomp&s;on, with the la&s;t of his brigade, on the morning of Tue&s;day &s;e'nnight, embarked at Fort-George; and, in the evening of the next day, general Sullivan arrived at Albany; that he had ordered an additional number of carpenters to a&s;&s;i&s;t in building boats: who, fini&s;hing eight every day, would have a hundred and ten complete by the twenty-fir&s;t, before which he was fearful the la&s;t of general Sullivan's brigade could not embark;&mdash;that they would carry thirty men each, be&s;ides the baggage, ammu|tion, and intrenching tools." * * *</P>
<P>He al&s;o informs, "that the &s;ixty barrels of powder had arrived, and would be forwarded that day;&mdash;that the fir&s;t regiment of general Sullivan's brigade marched that morn|ing; and that the intrenching tools and about &s;ix hundred barrels of pork were al&s;o gone on;&mdash;that he cannot po&s;|&s;ibly &s;end more than half of the three hundred thou&s;and dollars into Canada, (being greatly in debt on the public account, and the creditors exceedingly clamorous and im|portunate for payment) which &s;um he hopes will be &s;uf|ficient till the Canadians agree to take our paper currency, to which they are much aver&s;e, and of which he is ex|ceedingly doubtful;&mdash;that he had got the chain, and would forward it that day to general Arnold, with orders to fix it at the rapids of Richelieu." He adds "that he had reviewed general Sullivan's brigade in pre&s;ence of about two hundred and &s;ixty Indians, who were greatly plea&s;ed with the order and regularity of the troops, and &s;urpri&s;ed at the number, which, the tories had indu&s;triou&s;|ly

propagated, con&s;i&s;ted only of three companies, and that they were kept always walking the &s;treets, to induce them to believe their number was much greater than it really was."</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a copy of general Schuyler's in&s;tructions to James Price, e&s;quire, deputy commi&s;&s;ary-general, for the regulation of his conduct in that department, which I received la&s;t night, and which general Schuyler reque&s;ted me to forward you.

As to the medicines, I &s;hall &s;peak to Dr. Mor|gan (not yet arrived) as &s;oon as he comes, and order him to forward &s;uch as may be nece&s;&s;ary and can be po&s;&s;ibly &s;pared.</P>

<P>I THIS moment received by expre&s;s from general Schuyler an account of the melancholy pro&s;pect and re|ver&s;e of our affairs in Canada: and pre&s;uming that the letters which accompany this will give Congre&s;s full infor|mation upon the &s;ubject, I &s;hall only add that general Schuy|ler, in pur&s;uance of orders from the honourable commi&s;|&s;ioners, has directed brigadier-general Sullivan to halt his brigade; as a further reinforcement (on account of the &s;car|city of provi&s;ions) would not relieve, but contribute great|ly to di&s;tre&s;s our troops already in Canada. Before he received the&s;e orders, all the brigade, except Dayton's and Wayne's regiments, had left Albany: but I &s;uppo&s;e he will be able to &s;top their march.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="029737_0142_0FE2482132ED9CE8">
By my letter of the fifteenth, Congre&s;s will perceive the quantity of pork already gone from hence: and the commi&s;&s;ary has a&s;&s;ured me that he will forward a further &s;upply as &s;oon as it can be po&s;&s;ibly collected. I had al&s;o directed five tons of lead to be &s;ent to general Schuyler for the Canada expedition, before I received this unfortu|nate account; which was as much as could be &s;pared for the pre&s;ent (our &s;tock being incon&s;iderable in proportion to the demand we may rea&s;onably expect for it;) and &s;hall do every thing in my power to relieve our affairs from their pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and melancholy &s;ituation in that quarter, which occurs to me and appears nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour to inform Congre&s;s that I arrived here ye&s;terday afternoon about one o'clock, and found all in a &s;tate of peace and quiet. I had not time to view the works carrying on, and tho&s;e ordered to be be|gun when I went away; but have rea&s;on to believe, from the report of &s;uch of the general and other officers as I had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee, that they have been pro&s;ecuted and forwarded with all po&s;&s;ible diligence and di&s;patch.</P>
<P>I am much concerned for the &s;ituation of our affairs in Canada, and am fearful, ere this, it is much wor&s;e than was fir&s;t reported at Philadelphia. The intelligence from thence, in a letter from captain Wilkin&s;on of the &s;econd regiment, to general Greene, is truly alarming. It not only confirms the account of colonel Biddle and major Sherburne's defeat, but &s;eems to forebode general Arnold's, with the lo&s;s of Montreal. I have inclo&s;ed a copy of the letter, which will but too well &s;hew that there is founda|tion for my apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="029737_0145_0FE247CE8A9FFC68">
On Wedne&s;day evening I received an expre&s;s from gen|eral Schuyler, with &s;undry papers re&s;pecting Sir John John|&s;ton, which I have not time to copy, as the po&s;t is ju&s;t go|ing off, but will do my&s;elf the honour of tran&s;mitting you as &s;oon as I po&s;&s;ibly can.</P>
<P>Before I left Philadelphia, I employed a per&s;on to &s;uper|intend the building of the gondolas which Congre&s;s had re&s;olved on for this place.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my letter of ye&s;terday which I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you, and which was de&s;igned to have gone by po&s;t, but was prevented by his departure before the u&s;u|al time, I mentioned my having received by expre&s;s a let|ter and &s;undry papers from general Schuyler, re&s;pecting Sir John John&s;ton, copies of which I herewith tran&s;mit you for your in&s;pection and peru&s;al. They will &s;hew you what mea&s;ures were planned and attempted for apprehending him, and &s;ecuring the Scotch Highlanders in Tryon county.</P>
<P>Having heard that the troops at Bo&s;ton are extremely unea&s;y and almo&s;t mutinous for want of pay, (&s;everal months being now due) I mu&s;t take the liberty to repeat a que&s;tion contained in my letter of the fifth ultimo&mdash;"What mode is to be pur&s;ued re&s;pecting it? whether is money to be &s;ent from hence by the payma&s;ter general, or &s;ome per&s;on &s;ub|ordinate
<PB N="147" REF="029737_0146_0FE2482440280618">
ordinate to him to be appointed there for that purpo&s;e?" I expected &s;ome direction would have been given in this in|&s;tance, long ere this, from what was contained in yours ac|companying (or about the time of) the la&s;t remittance. I pre&s;ume it has been omitted by rea&s;on of the multiplicity of important bu&s;ine&s;s before Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>In peru&s;ing the &s;everal re&s;olves you honoured me with when at Philadelphia and &s;ince my return, I find one allow|ing a chief engineer for the army in a &s;eparate department. The &s;ervice requiring many of them, I wi&s;h Congre&s;s, if they know any per&s;ons &s;killed in this bu&s;ine&s;s, would ap|point them. General Schuyler has frequently applied, and &s;ugge&s;ted the nece&s;&s;ity of having &s;ome in Canada. I my|&s;elf know of none.</P>
<P>I al&s;o find there is a re&s;olve of the third of June for taking Indians into the &s;ervice, which, if literally con&s;tru|ed, confines them to that in Canada. Is that the meaning of Congre&s;s, or that the commander-in-chief may order their &s;ervice to any place he may think nece&s;&s;ary?</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the e&s;tabli&s;hing expre&s;&s;es between the &s;ever|al continental po&s;ts,&mdash;who is to do it? the re&s;olve does not &s;ay. Is it expected by Congre&s;s that I &s;hould? Who|ever the work is a&s;&s;igned to, I think, &s;hould execute it with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch. The late imperfect and contradicto|ry accounts re&s;pecting our defeat at the Cedars, &s;trongly point out the nece&s;&s;ity there is for it. No intelligence is yet come from any officer in command there, (and mo&s;t probably for want of a proper channel to convey it) though this misfortune happened &s;o long ago.</P>
<P>When I had the honour of being in Congre&s;s, if I mi&s;|take not, I heard a re&s;olve read, or was told of one, allow|ing the New-York troops the &s;ame pay as others in the continental &s;ervice. This, if any &s;uch, I do not find; and if there is not &s;uch a one, I &s;hall be under &s;ome embarra&s;s|ment, how to pay the militia to be provided by this prov|ince. The re&s;olve providing them &s;ays they are to be paid, while in &s;ervice, as other troops are. But if tho&s;e enli&s;ted heretofore in this province are to receive according to the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, it is a matter of doubt what the militia are to have.</P>
<P>Before this comes to hand, a hand-bill, containing an
<PB N="148" REF="029737_0147_0FE247D010F097F8">
account of a victory gained by general Arnold over the party that had defeated colonel Biddle and major Sher|burne, will mo&s;t probably have reached you. I have in|quired into the authenticity of this fortunate report, and have found there is no dependence to be put in it; nor do I believe it de&s;erving of the lea&s;t credit. I &s;hall be happy not to hear the rever&s;e.</P>

<P>As the militia will be coming in, and they will be in much need of covering, plea&s;e to have all the tents, and cloth proper for making them that can be procured, for|warded as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honoured ye&s;terday with your favour of the &s;eventh, with its inclo&s;ures. When Dr. Potts arrives, I &s;hall order him to Canada or Lake-George, as may appear mo&s;t proper. It is certainly nece&s;&s;ary that he or Dr. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">inge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould go to the former. The re&s;olve re&s;pecting general Woo&s;ter's recal I will immediately tran&s;mit him, with directions to repair hither without delay.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of our affairs in Canada, as reported by the honourable commi&s;&s;ioners, is truly alarming; and I am &s;orry that my opinion of the ill con&s;equences re&s;ulting from the &s;hort enli&s;tment of the army &s;hould be but too well confirmed by the experience they have had of the want of di&s;cipline and order in our &s;oldiery there. This induces me again to wi&s;h Congre&s;s to determine on a lib|eral allowance to engage the troops already in &s;ervice to re-enli&s;t for a longer period, or during the continuance of the war; nor can I forbear expre&s;&s;ing my opinion of the propriety of keeping the military che&s;t always &s;upplied with money, as evils of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting nature are often pro|duced for want of a regular payment of troops. The neg|lect makes them impatient and unea&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="029737_0148_0FE24826D1C9CD70">
I am much &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;carcity of provi&s;ions there, particularly of flour; as, from &s;everal accounts I had re|ceived from thence, I was led to expect that con&s;iderable &s;upplies of that article could be procured there. That our misfortunes may not become greater, I have wrote to the commi&s;&s;ary to forward more provi&s;ions, in addition to tho&s;e already &s;ent.</P>
<P>An adjutant and quarter-ma&s;ter-general are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, with a&s;&s;i&s;tants. The money &s;aved to the conti|nent by their non-appointment will be but &s;mall and trifling, when put in competition with the lo&s;s for want of them. Colonel Fleming, who acted in the former capacity under general Montgomery, is now here: but his indi&s;po&s;ition is &s;uch as to render him unfit, at this time, for the po&s;t:&mdash;it is an important one, and requires vigour and activity to di&s;charge the duties of it. He will be of much &s;ervice to colonel Reed, the bu&s;ine&s;s of who&s;e office will increa&s;e con&s;iderably by the augmentation of the army.</P>
<P>It will be nece&s;&s;ary, too, that the commi&s;&s;aries in Can|ada, and the deputy quarter-ma&s;ter-generals, &s;hould have &s;everal a&s;&s;i&s;tants and clerks: nor do I think a preci&s;e num|ber can be fixed on, as a variety of circum&s;tances may and mu&s;t occur, to render the number, e&s;&s;ential for doing the bu&s;ine&s;s in tho&s;e departments, greater or le&s;s at different times. It will be better, I apprehend, to leave it indef|inite, and with power to the commanding officer to allow &s;uch as may be wanted.</P>
<P>I am &s;till in the dark, how the unfortunate affair ended at the Cedars, or on what terms the &s;urrender was made, as the la&s;t letter from the commi&s;&s;ioners has reference to a former, and mentions an agreement entered into, which I have not &s;een: but I know of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> more than I could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>I have received from Providence, in con&s;equence of Mr. Morris's order, as chairman of the &s;ecret committee of Congre&s;s, two hundred and thirty-four mu&s;kets, in part of the two hundred and forty-four directed to be &s;ent. The inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from Mr. Brown will ac|count for the deficiency.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be much obliged by your ordering a quantity of lead and flints to be immediately forwarded: our demands for both are and will be very pre&s;&s;ing. There are al&s;o want|ed
<PB N="150" REF="029737_0149_0FE2482E560D9D58">
&s;ome particular and nece&s;&s;ary medicines to complete our ho&s;pital che&s;ts, of which I will get Dr. Morgan to furni&s;h Congre&s;s with a li&s;t, when he writes or waits on them about &s;ome other matters nece&s;&s;ary to be fixed in his de|partment.</P>
<P>As general Woo&s;ter, in all probability, will be here in a little time in compliance with the re&s;olve of Congre&s;s and my order tran&s;mitted to him, I wi&s;h to know what I am to do with him when he comes.</P>
<P>General Schuyler, in his letter of the thirty-fir&s;t ultimo, of which I tran&s;mitted you a copy ye&s;terday, mentions that &s;undry per&s;ons had a de&s;ign to &s;eize him as a tory, and probably &s;till have; and wi&s;hes Congre&s;s to give him &s;ome public mark of their approbation, if they are convinc|ed of his zeal and attachment to the cau&s;e of his country. Whether he intended that I &s;hould communicate his de&s;ire to them, or not, I am not certain: but, &s;uppo&s;ing that he did, I mu&s;t beg leave to reque&s;t that you will lay the par|agraph before them, that they may do, in the in&s;tance of his requi&s;ition, whatever they may judge nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>SINCE I did my&s;elf the honour of writing to you ye&s;terday, I have had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing, and for a few minutes conver&s;ing with Mr. Cha&s;e and Mr. Car|roll, from Canada. Their account of our troops and the &s;ituation of affairs in that department cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ur|pri&s;e you more than it has done me. But I need not touch upon a &s;ubject which you will be &s;o well informed of from the fountain-head; nor &s;hould I have given you the trouble of a letter by this day's po&s;t, but for the di&s;traction
<PB N="151" REF="029737_0150_0FE24881324195D8">
which &s;eems to prevail in the commi&s;&s;ary's department, as well as others in that quarter,&mdash;the nece&s;&s;ity of having it under one general direction,&mdash;and the di&s;&s;atisfaction of colonel Trumbull at the allowance made him by Congre&s;s as an equivalent for his trouble. With re&s;pect to this particular matter, I can only &s;ay that I think he is a man well [<HI>calculated</HI>] for the bu&s;ine&s;s, and that, where a &s;hil|ling is &s;aved in the pay, a pound may be lo&s;t by mi&s;man|agement in the office; and that his re&s;ignation at this time (I mean this campaign) may po&s;&s;ibly be attended with fa|tal con&s;equences. I therefore humbly &s;ubmit to Congre&s;s the propriety of hand&s;omely rewarding tho&s;e gentlemen who hold &s;uch very important, trouble&s;ome, and hazard|ous offices, as commi&s;&s;ary and quarter-ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking to the former about the &s;upplies nece&s;&s;ary for the troops to be rai&s;ed, he informed me that the quan|tity of &s;alt provi&s;ions which was &s;hipping from hence might render his attempts to do it precarious; in con&s;equence of which, I de&s;ired him to lay the matter before the con|vention of this colony, which he will do this day, but in the mean while de&s;ired Congre&s;s might be informed of the matter, which I cannot better do than in his own words inclo&s;ed, and &s;ubmit the con&s;ideration of it to the wi&s;dom of that honourable body.</P>
<P>To Congre&s;s I al&s;o &s;ubmit the propriety of keeping the two continental battalions (under the command of colonels Shee and M^cGaw) at Philadelphia, when there is the greate&s;t probability of a &s;peedy attack upon this place from the king's troops. The encouragements given by gover|nor Tryon to the di&s;affected, which are circulated, no one can well tell how,&mdash;the movements of the&s;e kind of peo|ple, which are more ea&s;y to perceive than de&s;cribe,&mdash;the confident report, which is &s;aid to have come immediately from governor Tryon, and brought by a frigate from Hal|ifax, that the troops at that place were embarking for this,&mdash;added to a thou&s;and incidental circum&s;tances, trivial in them&s;elves, but &s;trong from compari&s;on,&mdash;leave not a doubt upon my mind but that troops are hourly expected at the Hook.</P>
<P>I had no doubt when I left this city for Philadelphia, but that &s;ome mea&s;ures would have been taken to &s;ecure
<PB N="152" REF="029737_0151_0FE2482FDB1E90E0">
the &s;u&s;pected and dangerous per&s;ons of this government before now, and left orders for the military to give every aid to the civil power. But the &s;ubject is delicate, and nothing is done in it. We may therefore have internal as well as external enemies to contend with.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honour of tran&s;mitting to Congre&s;s a letter which came by expre&s;s la&s;t night from general Schuyler, inclo&s;ing a copy of a letter to him from colonel Kirkland. I have likewi&s;e inclo&s;ed the copy of one di|rected to general Putnam or the commanding officer at New-York. The repre&s;entations contained in the&s;e letters have induced me, without waiting the determination of Congre&s;s, to direct general Schuyler immediately to com|mence a treaty with the Six Nations, and to engage them in our intere&s;t, upon the be&s;t terms he and his colleagues in commi&s;&s;ion can procure: and I tru&s;t the urgency of the occa&s;ion will ju&s;tify my proceeding to the Congre&s;s:&mdash;the nece&s;&s;ity for deci&s;ion and di&s;patch in all our mea&s;|ures, in my opinion, becomes every day more and more apparent.</P>
<P>The expre&s;s, Mr. Bennet, was overtaken at Albany by general Schuyler, who had received intelligence at Fort-George that a con&s;iderable body of Mohawk Indians were coming down the Mohawk river under the conduct of Sir John John&s;ton. The general's extreme hurry would not allow him to write: but it &s;eems his intention is to collect at Albany a &s;ufficient force to oppo&s;e Sir John. I have given him my opinion that colonel Day|ton's regiment &s;hould be employed in that &s;ervice, and to &s;ecure the po&s;t where Fort-Stanwix formerly &s;tood.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of an information that &s;everal mer|chants were exporting &s;alt pork and beef from this place, I reque&s;ted the commi&s;&s;ary to make application to the provincial Congre&s;s for a re&s;traint to be laid on the ex|portation of tho&s;e articles, as I apprehended, not only that the enemy might receive &s;upplies by the capture of
<PB N="153" REF="029737_0152_0FE24882B6613038">
our ve&s;&s;els, but that our people might &s;hortly experience a &s;carcity. The provincial Congre&s;s have accordingly made a re&s;olution (a copy of which is inclo&s;ed) to &s;top the exportation for fourteen days. They expect Congre&s;s will in the mean time frame &s;ome general regulations on this head. They are unwilling (they &s;ay) to &s;ubject their con&s;tituents to partial re&s;traints.</P>
<P>I once mentioned to Congre&s;s that I thought a war-office extremely nece&s;&s;ary, and they &s;eemed inclined to in|&s;titute one for our army; but the affair &s;eems to have been &s;ince dropped. Give me leave again to in&s;i&s;t on the util|ity and importance of &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment. The more I reflect upon the &s;ubject, the more I am convinced of its nece&s;&s;ity, and that affairs can never be properly con|ducted without it.</P>
<P>It is with plea&s;ure I receive the re&s;olve inclo&s;ed in your favour of the eleventh in&s;tant. One con&s;iderable ground of di&s;&s;atisfaction in the army is thereby removed.</P>
<P>I have employed per&s;ons in building the gondolas and rafts which the Congre&s;s thought nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of this place; and, in conjunction with the provincial Congre&s;s, have determined to &s;ink chevaux-de-fri&s;e, one of which is already begun.</P>

<P>I HEREWITH tran&s;mit you copies of a letter from general Schuyler and its &s;everal inclo&s;ures, which I received &s;ince I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you ye&s;ter|day. From the&s;e you will learn that general Thomas died the &s;econd in&s;tant; and the apprehen&s;ions of our frontier friends in this colony, that our &s;avage foes are meditating an attack again&s;t them.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg leave to refer you to a paragraph in the copy of general Schuyler's letter to general Putnam or the com|manding officer here, inclo&s;ed in mine of the thirteenth, where he reque&s;ts a &s;upply of cloathing to be &s;ent for the army in Canada. As there is but little or no probability of
<PB N="154" REF="029737_0153_0FE248315DD2C400">
getting it here, I &s;hall be glad to know whether there will be any chance of procuring it in Philadelphia; and, if it &s;hould be &s;ent through the hands of the quarter-ma&s;ter here, to what account it is to be charged.</P>
<P>I was la&s;t evening favoured with yours of the eleventh in&s;tant, and hope the two battalions, which Congre&s;s have ordered from Philadelphia for the defence of this place, will come provided with arms. If they do not, they will be of no &s;ervice, as there are more troops here already than are armed.</P>
<P>From general Schuyler's letter, he has in view the tak|ing po&s;t where Fort-Stanwix formerly &s;tood. I wrote him I thought it prudent, previous to that, to &s;ecure a po&s;t lower down, about the falls below the German-Flats, le&s;t the &s;avages &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the country, and pre|vent &s;upplies of men and provi&s;ions that may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end there in future. He &s;ays he is in want of cannon and ammunition; but has expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o ambiguou&s;ly, that I am at a lo&s;s to know whether he meant what he has &s;aid as an application or not,&mdash;this being the only intelli|gence on the &s;ubject, and the fir&s;t mention of his want. I have de&s;ired him to explain the matter, and, in his future requi&s;itions for nece&s;&s;aries, to be more certain and explicit as to quantity and quality. In the mean time I &s;hall &s;end him &s;ome intrenching tools, and inquire whether there are any cannon that can be &s;pared from hence.</P>

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour to tran&s;mit to Congre&s;s a copy of a letter covering copies of other papers, which I re|ceived ye&s;terday evening from general Sullivan. The intel|ligence communicated by him is plea&s;ing and intere&s;ting, and &s;uch as mu&s;t afford the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction, if the conduct the Canadians have di&s;covered &s;ince his arrival among them is ingenuous and &s;incere.</P>
<P>General Sullivan mentions his having given commi&s;&s;ions to &s;ome of the Canadians as a mea&s;ure founded in nece&s;&s;ity, and reque&s;ts my approbation of it. But not con&s;idering
<PB N="155" REF="029737_0154_0FE2488565F11E98">
my&s;elf empowered to &s;ay any thing upon the &s;ubject, it may not be improper for Congre&s;s to give him their opinion in this in&s;tance.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o inclo&s;ed copies of general Schuyler's letters received at the &s;ame time. They contain accounts re&s;pect|ing the Indians, variant from what was reported by Mr. Kirkland, but amounting to the &s;ame thing,&mdash;the probabil|ity of the &s;avages attacking our frontiers.</P>
<P>By la&s;t night's po&s;t I had information of a capture made by our armed ve&s;&s;els, of one of the tran&s;ports with a com|pany of Highlanders on board, bound to Bo&s;ton. The in-clo&s;ed extract from general Ward's letter to me will give you the intelligence more particularly. There are accounts in the city mentioning other valuable prizes: but as general Ward has &s;aid nothing of them, I fear they want authen|ticity.</P>
<P>I beg leave to mention that a further &s;um of money will be wanted for our military che&s;t by the time it can be &s;ent. The inclo&s;ed note from the pay-ma&s;ter-general &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity for it; and, I may add, be&s;ides his e&s;timate of draughts to be made, there are the claims of the ea&s;tern troops at Bo&s;ton for three or four months' pay, not included, and now due.</P>
<P>Colonel M^cGaw is arrived with part of his battalion; and by Wedne&s;day evening the whole both of his and colonel Shee's will be here, as I am told.</P>
<P>As it is and may be of great importance to have a com|munication with the Jer&s;ies and Long-I&s;land, I have had &s;everal flat-bottomed boats built for the purpo&s;e, and have thoughts of getting more for Po&s;aic and Hackin&s;ac rivers, where they may be equally nece&s;&s;ary for tran&s;porting our army or part of it occa&s;ionally, or &s;uccours coming to or going from it.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your fa|vours of the fourteenth and eighteenth in&s;tant, and the intere&s;ting re&s;olves contained in them, with which I have been honoured. The &s;everal matters recommended to my attention &s;hall be particularly regarded, and the directions of Congre&s;s and your reque&s;ts complied with in every in|&s;tance, as far as in my power.</P>
<P>The in&s;tituting a war-office is certainly an event of great importance, and, in all probability, will be recorded as &s;uch in the hi&s;toric page. The benefits derived from it, I flatter my&s;elf, will be con&s;iderable, though the plan upon which it is fir&s;t formed may not be entirely perfect. This, like other great works, in its fir&s;t edition, may not be free from error:&mdash;time will di&s;cover its defects, and ex|perience &s;ugge&s;t the remedy, and &s;uch further improvements as may be nece&s;&s;ary; but it was right to give it a begin|ning, in my opinion.</P>
<P>The recommendation to the convention of New-York for re&s;training and puni&s;hing di&s;affected per&s;ons, I am hopeful, will be attended with &s;alutary con&s;equences; and the prohibition again&s;t exporting provi&s;ions appears to have been a mea&s;ure founded in &s;ound policy, le&s;t proper &s;upplies &s;hould be wanted, wherewith to &s;upply our armies.</P>
<P>I have tran&s;mitted general Schuyler the re&s;olves about the Indians, and the others on which he is to act; and have reque&s;ted his &s;trict attention and exertions in or|der to their being carried into execution with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch.</P>
<P>I note your reque&s;t re&s;pecting Mr. Hancock. He &s;hall have &s;uch directions as may be nece&s;&s;ary for conducting
<PB N="157" REF="029737_0156_0FE2488B834802F8">
his office; and I am happy he will have &s;o early a re|mittance for paying the troops in his department.</P>
<P>The &s;ilver and paper money de&s;igned for Canada will be highly &s;erviceable, and I hope will be the means of re|e&s;tabli&s;hing our credit there in &s;ome degree with the Can|adians, and al&s;o encourage our men too, who have com|plained in this in&s;tance. When it arrives, I will &s;end it forward under a proper guard.</P>
<P>I have communicated to major-general Gates the re|&s;olve of Congre&s;s for him to repair to Canada, and di|rected him to view Point-au-fer, that a fortre&s;s may be erected if he &s;hall judge nece&s;&s;ary. He is preparing for his command, and in a few days will take his departure for it. I would fain hope his arrival there will give our af|fairs a complexion different from what they have worn for a long time pa&s;t, and that many e&s;&s;ential benefits will re&s;ult from it.</P>
<P>The kind attention Congre&s;s have &s;hewn to afford the commander-in-chief here every a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by re&s;olving that recommendatory letters be written to the conventions of New-Jer&s;ey, New-York, and a&s;&s;embly of Connecticut, to authorize him to call in the militia in ca&s;e of exigency, claims my thankful acknowledgments; and, I tru&s;t, if carried into execution, will produce many advantages in ca&s;e it may be expedient at any time to call in early rein|forcements. The delays incident to the ordinary mode may frequently render their aid too late, and prove ex|ceedingly injurious.</P>
<P>I this evening received intelligence of the nineteenth in&s;tant from captain Pond, of the armed &s;loop Schuyler, of his having taken, about fifty miles from this, on the &s;outh &s;ide of Long-I&s;land, a &s;hip and a &s;loop bound to Sandy-Hook. The &s;hip, from Gla&s;gow, with a company of the forty-&s;econd regiment, had been taken by one of commodore Hopkins's fleet, who took the &s;oldiers out, and ordered her to Rhode-I&s;land; after which, &s;he was retaken by the Cerberus, and put under the convoy of the &s;loop. As captain Pond informs me, there were five com|mi&s;&s;ioned officers, two ladies, and four privates on board. They are not yet arrived at head-quarters. Inclo&s;ed is an invoice of what they have on board.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="029737_0157_0FE24839CD061370">

<P>I have been up to view the grounds about King&s;bridge, and find them to admit of &s;everal places well calculated for defence; and, e&s;teeming it a pa&s;s of the utmo&s;t importance, have ordered works to be laid out, and &s;hall direct part of the two battalions from Penn&s;ylvania to &s;et about the ex|ecution immediately, and will add to their number &s;everal of the militia when they come in, to expedite them with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch.

<P>I WAS this morning honoured with your favour of the nineteenth in&s;tant, with &s;undry re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, which came to hand after I had clo&s;ed mine of the twenti|eth. I &s;hall appoint a deputy mu&s;ter-ma&s;ter-general as &s;oon as I can fix upon a proper per&s;on for the office, and direct him immediately to repair to Canada.</P>
<P>Mr. Bennet, the bearer of this, delivered me a letter to-day from general Schuyler, inclo&s;ing the proceedings of the commi&s;&s;ioners of Indian affairs at a meeting at Albany in con&s;equence of the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s (as they &s;ay) which I tran&s;mitted, the &s;eventh in&s;tant, for engaging the Indians in our &s;ervice. The gentlemen appear to me to have widely mi&s;taken the views of Congre&s;s in this in|&s;tance, and to have formed a plan for engaging &s;uch Indians as were not in contemplation. I cannot account upon what principles they have gone, as a part of their proceed|ings &s;hews they are about to hold a conference with the Six Nations.

of a body of men who are de&s;irous of being employed in the continental &s;ervice as a troop of hor&s;e, and at the &s;ame time to offer my opinion that &s;uch a corps may be ex|tremely u&s;eful in many re&s;pects. In a march, they may be of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice in reconnoitring the enemy and gaining intelligence, and have it in their power to render many important benefits. The terms on which they are willing to engage are inclo&s;ed, which appear to me mod|erate and rea&s;onable. I am al&s;o informed that another company might readily be made up, and mo&s;t probably upon the &s;ame terms.

I &s;incerely wi&s;h the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s had attended our arms in another quarter&mdash;but it has not. In Canada, the &s;ituation of our affairs is truly alarming. The inclo&s;ed copies of generals Schuyler, Sullivan, and Arnold's letters will in|form you that general Thomp&s;on has met with a repul&s;e at Three-Rivers, and is now a pri&s;oner in the hands of gen|eral Burgoyne, who (the&s;e accounts &s;ay) is arrived with a con&s;iderable army.

They will give you a further account of the melancholy &s;ituation of our affairs in Canada, and &s;hew that there is nothing left to &s;ave our army there but evacu|ating the country.</P>
<P>I am hopeful general Sullivan would retreat from the I&s;le-aux-noix without waiting for previous orders for that purpo&s;e; as, from generals Schuyler and Arnold's letters, it is much to be feared, by remaining there any con&s;idera|ble time, his retreat would be cut off, or at lea&s;t be a mat|ter of extreme difficulty. I would ob&s;erve to Congre&s;s that it is not in my power to &s;end any carpenters from hence to build the gondolas and gallies general Arnold mentions, without taking them from a work equally nece&s;&s;ary (if not more &s;o) here, of the &s;ame kind:&mdash;and &s;ubmit it to them whether it may not be advi&s;eable (as it is of great import|ance to us to have a number of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els on the Lake, to prevent the enemy's pa&s;&s;ing) to withdraw the carpenters for the pre&s;ent from the frigates building up the North-river, and detach them immediately, with all that can be got at Philadelphia, for that purpo&s;e and carrying on tho&s;e here.</P>
<P>I have the plea&s;ure to inform you of another capture made by our armed ve&s;&s;els, of a tran&s;port, on the nine|teenth in&s;tant, with a company of Highland grenadiers on board. The inclo&s;ed extract of a letter from general Ward, by la&s;t night's po&s;t, contains the particulars; to which I beg leave to refer you.</P>
<P>I have been honoured with your favours of the twenty-fir&s;t and twenty-fifth in&s;tant in due order, with their im|portant inclo&s;ures, to which I &s;hall particularly attend. I have tran&s;mitted general Schuyler a copy of the re&s;olve of Congre&s;s re&s;pecting the Mohickan and Stockbridge In|dians, and directed him to put an immediate &s;top to the rai&s;ing the two companies.</P>
<P>The quarter-ma&s;ter-general has been called upon for &s;topping the tents de&s;igned for Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, and or|dered to forward them immediately. He means to write to Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject, and hopes his conduct will

not appear to de&s;erve their reprehen&s;ion. Of this they will judge from his relation of the matter.</P>
<P>Being extremely de&s;irous to forward the intelligence from Canada to Congre&s;s, well knowing their anxiety about our affairs there, I mu&s;t defer writing upon &s;ome other matters I want to lay before them, until the next oppor|tunity, which I hope will be to-morrow, when I will in|form them fully upon the &s;ubject of rations, having de&s;ired the commi&s;&s;ary-general to furni&s;h me with &s;ome things nece&s;&s;ary in that in&s;tance.</P>

<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s, which he informs me he has with Con|gre&s;s, is a &s;ecret offer of his &s;ervices, to the end that, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be rejected, he might have his way left open to an employment in the Ea&s;t-Indies, to which he is a&s;&s;igned: and in that ca&s;e he flatters him&s;elf he will ob|tain leave of Congre&s;s to go to Great-Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="029737_0162_0FE24891346957D8">
As he had been put upon his parole by Congre&s;s, I thought it would be improper to &s;tay his progre&s;s to Phil|adelphia, &s;hould he be in fact de&s;tined thither. I there|fore &s;end him forward, but (to prevent impo&s;ition) under the care of an officer, with letters found upon him, which, from their tenour, &s;eem calculated to recommend him to Congre&s;s.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with the reque&s;t of Congre&s;s contain|ed in your favour of the twenty-fifth in&s;tant, and my prom|i&s;e of ye&s;terday, I do my&s;elf the honour to inform you that the co&s;t of a ration, according to the commi&s;&s;ary-general's e&s;timate, from the fir&s;t of July to the fir&s;t of December, will be from eight-pence to eight-pence halfpen|ny, York currency.</P>
<P>Having di&s;charged the obligation I was under in this in&s;tance, and finding that many applications have been made for victualling the flying camp, I would, with all po&s;&s;ible deference, wi&s;h Congre&s;s to con&s;ider the matter well before they come to any determination upon it. Who the gentlemen are that have made offers upon this occa&s;ion, I know not: con&s;equently my objections to their appointment cannot proceed from per&s;onal di&s;like; nor have I it in view to &s;erve Mr. Trumbull the commi&s;&s;ary-general, by wi&s;hing him to have the direction of the whole &s;upplies for his emolument; becau&s;e whatever rations are taken from him &s;ave him the trouble of &s;upplying provi&s;|ions to the amount, without dimini&s;hing his pay,&mdash;that being fixed and certain:&mdash;but what influences me is a re|gard to the public good. I am morally certain, if the bu&s;ine&s;s is taken out of Mr. Trumbull's hands and put in|to another's, that it may and will in all probability be at|tended with great and many inconveniences. It is likely, during the continuance of the war between us and Great-Britain, that the army here, or part of it, and the troops
<PB N="164" REF="029737_0163_0FE2483F6183A6A0">
compo&s;ing the flying camp, will be frequently joined, and under the nece&s;&s;ity of affording each other mutual aid. If this event is probable (and mo&s;t certainly it is) the &s;ame confu&s;ion and di&s;order will re&s;ult from having two com|mi&s;&s;aries, or one commi&s;&s;ary and one contractor in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> army in the &s;ame department, as did between Mr. Trumbull and Mr. Living&s;ton on the coming of the form|er to New-York. I cannot di&s;criminate the two ca&s;es; and not fore&s;eeing that any good con&s;equences will flow from the mea&s;ure, but that many bad ones will,&mdash;&s;uch as cla&s;hing of intere&s;ts,&mdash;a contention for &s;tores, carriages,&mdash;and many other cau&s;es that might be mentioned if hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s would permit,&mdash;I confe&s;s I cannot perceive the propriety of appointing a different per&s;on, or any but the commi&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o add, that few armies, if any, have been better &s;upplied than the troops under Mr. Trumbull's care in this in&s;tance; which, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, ought to have con&s;iderable weight, e&s;pecially as we have &s;trong rea&s;ons to believe that a large &s;hare of the misfortunes our arms have &s;u&s;tained in Canada &s;prang from a want of proper and nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Mr. Trumbull too (I am informed) has already made provi&s;ion in New-Jer&s;ey for the flying camp which will be &s;tationed there, and employed proper per&s;ons in that colony to tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s incident to his department, in obe|dience to my orders, and in full confidence that it was to come under his management.</P>
<P>My great de&s;ire to &s;ee the affairs of this important po&s;t, on which &s;o much depends, go on in an ea&s;y, &s;mooth and uninterrupted cour&s;e, has led me to &s;ay thus much upon the &s;ubject, and will, I hope, (if I am unhappy enough to differ in opinion with Congre&s;s) plead my excu&s;e for the liberty I have taken.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o beg leave to mention to Congre&s;s the ne|ce&s;&s;ity there is of &s;ome new regulations being entered into, re&s;pecting the chaplains of this army. They will remem|ber that applications were made to increa&s;e their pay, which was conceived too low for their &s;upport; and that it was propo&s;ed (if it could not be done for the whole) that the number &s;hould be le&s;&s;ened, and one be appointed
<PB N="165" REF="029737_0164_0FE2489B045F5AB0">
to two regiments, with an additional allowance. This latter expedient was adopted, and, while the army con|tinued all together at one encampment, an&s;wered well, or at lea&s;t did not produce many inconveniences. But the army now being differently circum&s;tanced from what it then was,&mdash;part here, part at Bo&s;ton, and a third part detached to Canada,&mdash;has introduced much confu&s;ion and di&s;order in this in&s;tance; nor do I know how it is po&s;&s;ible to remedy the evil, but by affixing one to each regiment, with &s;alaries competent to their &s;upport. No &s;hifting, no change from one regiment to another can an&s;wer the pur|po&s;e; and in many ca&s;es it could never be done though the regiments &s;hould con&s;ent,&mdash;as where detachments are compo&s;ed of unequal numbers, or ordered from different po&s;ts. Many more inconveniences might be pointed out: but the&s;e, it is pre&s;umed, will &s;ufficiently &s;hew the defect of the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the propriety of an alter|ation. What that alteration &s;hall be, Congre&s;s will plea&s;e to determine.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s, I doubt not, will have heard of the plot that was forming among many di&s;affected per&s;ons in this city and government for aiding the king's troops upon their arrival. No regular plan &s;eems to have been dige&s;ted: but &s;everal per&s;ons have been enli&s;ted, and &s;worn to join them. The matter, I am in hopes, by a timely di&s;covery, will be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and put a &s;top to. Many citizens and others, among whom is the mayor, are now in confine|ment. The matter has been traced up to governor Tryon; and the mayor appears to have been a principal agent, or go-between him and the per&s;ons concerned in it. The plot had been communicated to &s;ome of the army, and part of my guard engaged in it. T * * * H * * *, one of them, has been tried, and, by the unanimous opinion of a court-martial, is &s;entenced to die,&mdash;having enli&s;ted him&s;elf, and engaged others. The &s;entence, by the advice of the whole council of general officers, will be put in execution to-day at eleven o'clock. The others are not tried. I am hopeful this example will produce many &s;alutary con|&s;equences, and deter others from entering into the like traitorous practices.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I was la&s;t night honoured with your favour of the twenty-&s;ixth in&s;tant, and, agreeable to your reque&s;t, &s;hall pay proper attention to the re&s;olves it inclo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve the augmentation Congre&s;s have re&s;olved to make to the forces de&s;tined for the northern department, and the bounty to be allowed &s;uch &s;oldiers as will enli&s;t for three years. I hope many good con&s;equences will re|&s;ult from the&s;e mea&s;ures; and that, from the latter, a con|&s;iderable

number of men may be induced to engage in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I &s;hould e&s;teem my&s;elf extremely happy to afford the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Canada department in compliance with the de&s;ire of Congre&s;s and your requi&s;ition, were it in my power: but it is not. The return which I tran&s;|mitted ye&s;terday will but too well convince Congre&s;s of my incapacity in this in&s;tance, and point out to them that the force I now have is trifling, con&s;idering the many and important po&s;ts that are nece&s;&s;ary, and mu&s;t be &s;upported, if po&s;&s;ible. But few militia have yet come in, the whole being about twelve hundred, including the two battalions of this city, and one company from the Jer&s;ies. I wi&s;h the delay may not be attended with di&s;agreeable con&s;e|quences, and their aid may not come too late, or when it may not be wanted. I have wrote, I have done every thing I could, to call them in: but they have not come, though I am told that they are generally willing.</P>
<P>The accounts communicated ye&s;terday through lieuten|ant Davi&s;on's letter are partly confirmed, and, I dare &s;ay, will turn out to be true on the whole. For two or three days pa&s;t, three or four &s;hips have been dropping in; and I ju&s;t now received an expre&s;s from an officer appointed to keep a look-out on Staten-I&s;land, that forty-five arrived at the Hook to-day:&mdash;&s;ome &s;ay more; and I &s;uppo&s;e the whole fleet will be in, within a day or two. I am hope|ful, before they are prepared to attack, that I &s;hall get &s;ome reinforcements. Be that as it may, I &s;hall attempt to make the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition I can of our troops, in order to give them a proper reception, and to prevent the ruin and de&s;truction they are meditating again&s;t us.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the plea&s;ure of receiving your favour of the twenty-ninth early this morning, with which you have been plea&s;ed to honour me, together with the re&s;olves for a fur|ther augmentation of our army.</P>
<P>The battalion of Germans, which Congre&s;s have order|ed to be rai&s;ed, will be a corps of much &s;ervice; and I am hopeful that &s;uch per&s;ons will be appointed officers, as will complete their enli&s;tments with all po&s;&s;ible expedition.</P>
<P>I &s;hall communicate to colonel Steven&s;on and one of his field-officers what you have reque&s;ted, and direct them to re|pair immediately to Philadelphia. It is an unlucky cir|cum&s;tance that the term of enli&s;tment of the&s;e three com|panies, and of the rifle battalion, &s;hould expire at this time when a hot campaign is, in all probability, about to com|mence.</P>
<P>Canada, it is certain, would have been an important ac|qui&s;ition, and well worth the expen&s;es incurred in the pur|&s;uit of it. But as we could not reduce it to our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the retreat of our army with &s;o little lo&s;s, under &s;uch a va|riety of di&s;tre&s;&s;es, mu&s;t be e&s;teemed a mo&s;t fortunate event. It is true, the accounts we have received do not fully au|thori&s;e us to &s;ay that we have &s;u&s;tained no lo&s;s: but they hold forth a probable ground for &s;uch conclu&s;ion. I am anxious to hear it confirmed.</P>
<P>I have the honour of tran&s;mitting you an extract of a letter received la&s;t night from general Ward. If the &s;cheme the privateers had in view, and the mea&s;ures he had planned, have been carried into execution, the Highland corps will be tolerably well di&s;po&s;ed of: but I fear the for|tunate event has not taken place.</P>
<P>In general Ward's letter, was inclo&s;ed one from lieuten|ant-colonel Campbell, who was made pri&s;ioner with the Highland troops. I have tran&s;mitted you a copy. This will give you a full and exact account of the number of pri&s;oners that were on board the four tran&s;ports; and will prove, beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, that the evacuation of Bo&s;ton by the Briti&s;h troops was a matter neither known nor expected when he received his orders. Indeed &s;o
<PB N="169" REF="029737_0168_0FE2489E0E365610">
many facts had concurred before to &s;ettle the matter, that no additional proofs were nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>When I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you ye&s;terday, I had only been informed of the arrival of forty-five of the fleet in the morning. Since that, I have received authentic in|telligence from &s;undry per&s;ons (among them, from general Greene) that a hundred and ten &s;ail came in before night, that were counted, and that more were &s;een about du&s;k in the offing. I have no doubt but the whole that &s;ailed from Halifax are now at the Hook.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I was about to conclude my letter, I received one from a gentleman upon the &s;ubject of calling the five regiments from Bo&s;ton to the defence of Canada or New-York, and to have militia rai&s;ed in their lieu. I have &s;ent you a copy, and &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that I know the author well: his hand-writing is quite familiar to me: he is a member of the General Court, very &s;en&s;ible, of great influ|ence, and a warm and zealous friend to the cau&s;e of Amer|ica. The expedient propo&s;ed by him is &s;ubmitted to Con|gre&s;s.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you, and on the &s;ame day, &s;everal &s;hips more arrived within the Hook, making the number that came in then a hundred and ten; and there remains no doubt of the whole of the fleet from Halifax being now here. Ye&s;terday evening fifty of them came up the bay and anchored on the Staten-I&s;land &s;ide. Their views I cannot preci&s;ely determine; but am ex|tremely apprehen&s;ive, as part of them only came, that they mean to &s;urround the i&s;land, and &s;ecure the &s;tock upon it. I had con&s;ulted with a committee of the provincial Con|gre&s;s upon the &s;ubject, before the arrival of the fleet; and they appointed a per&s;on to &s;uperintend the bu&s;ine&s;s, and to drive the &s;tock off. I al&s;o wrote to brigadier-general Heard, and directed him to the mea&s;ure le&s;t it might be neglected; but am fearful it has not been effected.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="029737_0169_0FE2484B9037FE28">
Our reinforcement of militia is yet but &s;mall:&mdash;I can|not a&s;certain the amount, not having got a return. How|ever, I tru&s;t, if the enemy make an attack, they will meet with a repul&s;e, as I have the plea&s;ure to inform you that an agreeable &s;pirit and willingne&s;s for action &s;eem to animate and pervade the whole of our troops.</P>
<P>As it is difficult to determine what objects the enemy may have in contemplation, and whether they may not detach &s;ome part of their force to Amboy, and to ravage that part of the country, if not extend their views farther, I &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s whether it may not be expedient for them to repeat and pre&s;s home their reque&s;ts to the different governments that are to provide men for the fly|ing camp, to furni&s;h their quotas with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;|patch. It is a matter of great importance, and will be of &s;erious con&s;equence, to have the camp e&s;tabli&s;hed in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould be able to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of this river, and cut off the &s;upplies of troops that might be nec|e&s;&s;ary on certain emergencies to be &s;ent from hence.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t entreat your attention to an application I made &s;ome time ago for flints. We are extremely deficient in this nece&s;&s;ary article, and &s;hall be greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed if we cannot obtain a &s;upply. Of lead we have a &s;ufficient quantity for the whole campaign, taken off the hou&s;es here.</P>
<P>E&s;teeming it of infinite advantage to prevent the enemy from getting fre&s;h provi&s;ions, and hor&s;es for their waggons, artillery, &amp;c, I gave orders to a party of our men on Staten-I&s;land (&s;ince writing to general Heard) to drive the &s;tock off without waiting for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance or direction of the committees there, le&s;t their &s;low mode of tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s might produce too much delay;&mdash;and have &s;ent this morning to know what they have done. I am this morning informed by a gentleman, that the committee of Elizabeth-Town &s;ent their company of light-hor&s;e on Mon|day to effect it, and that &s;ome of their militia were to give their aid ye&s;terday. He adds that he was credibly told la&s;t night by a party of the militia coming to this place, that ye&s;terday they &s;aw a good deal of &s;tock driving off the

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the honour to addre&s;s you on the thirtieth ultimo, I tran&s;mitted a copy of a letter I had re|ceived from a gentleman, a member of the honourable Gen|eral Court, <HI>[of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts]</HI> &s;ugge&s;ting the improbability of &s;uccours coming from thence in any rea&s;onable time, either for the defence of this place, or to reinforce our troops engaged in the Canada expedition. I am &s;orry to inform you, that, from a variety of intelligence, his appre|hen&s;ions appear to be ju&s;t, and to be fully confirmed: nor have I rea&s;on to expect but that the &s;upplies from the other two governments, Connecticut and New-Hamp&s;hire, will be extremely &s;low and greatly deficient in number.</P>
<P>As it now &s;eems beyond que&s;tion, and clear to demon|&s;tration, that the enemy mean to direct their operations
<PB N="172" REF="029737_0171_0FE2484D14DD1850">
and bend their mo&s;t vigorous efforts again&s;t this colony, and will attempt to unite their two armies,&mdash;that under general Burgoyne, and the one arrived here,&mdash;I cannot but think the expedient propo&s;ed by that gentleman is ex|ceedingly ju&s;t; and that the continental regiments, now in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, &s;hould be immediately called from thence, and be employed where there is the &s;tronge&s;t rea|&s;on to believe their aid will be indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. The expediency of the mea&s;ure I &s;hall &s;ubmit to the con|&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, and will only ob&s;erve, as my opin|ion, that there is not the mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect of an at|tempt being made, where they now are, by the enemy; and, if there &s;hould, that the militia that can be a&s;&s;embled upon the &s;horte&s;t notice will be more than equal to repel it. They are well armed, re&s;olute, and determined, and will in&s;tantly oppo&s;e any inva&s;ion that may be made in their own colony.</P>
<P>I &s;hall al&s;o take the liberty again to reque&s;t Congre&s;s to intere&s;t them&s;elves in having the militia rai&s;ed and for|warded with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, as fa&s;t as any con&s;id|erable number of them can be collected, that are to com|po&s;e the flying camp. This I mentioned in my letter ye&s;|terday, but think proper to repeat it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing more and more convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity. The camp will be in the neighbourhood of Amboy: and I &s;hall be glad that the conventions, or committees of &s;afety, of tho&s;e governments from whence they come, may be reque&s;ted to give me previous notice of their marching, that I may form &s;ome plan, and direct provi&s;ion to be made for their reception.</P>
<P>The di&s;affection of the people at that place and others not far di&s;tant is exceedingly great; and, unle&s;s it is checked and overawed, it may become more general, and be very alarming. The arrival of the enemy will encour|age it. They, or at lea&s;t a part of them, are already land|ed on Staten-I&s;land, which is quite contiguous; and about four thou&s;and were marching about it ye&s;terday, as I have been advi&s;ed, and are leaving no arts un-e&s;&s;ayed to gain the inhabitants to their &s;ide, who &s;eem but too favourably di&s;po&s;ed. It is not unlikely that in a little time they may attempt to cro&s;s to the Jer&s;ey &s;ide, and induce many to
<PB N="173" REF="029737_0172_0FE248A69A860DE8">
join them, either from motives of intere&s;t or fear, unle&s;s there is a force to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>As we are fully convinced that the mini&s;terial army we &s;hall have to oppo&s;e this campaign will be great and numer|ous, and well know that the utmo&s;t indu&s;try will be u&s;ed, as it already has been, to excite the &s;avages and every body of people to arms again&s;t us whom they can influence, it certainly behoves us to &s;train every nerve to counteract their de&s;igns. I would therefore &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s, whether (e&s;pecially as our &s;chemes for employing the we&s;t|ern Indians do not &s;eem to be attended with any great pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, from general Schuyler's accounts) it may not be advi&s;eable to take mea&s;ures to engage tho&s;e of the ea&s;tward, the St. John's, Nova-Scotia, Penob&s;cot, &amp;c. in our favour. I have been told that &s;everal might be got, perhaps five or &s;ix hundred or more, readily to join us. If they can, I &s;hould imagine it ought to be done. It will prevent our enemies from &s;ecuring their friend&s;hip; and further they will be of infinite &s;ervice in annoying and hara&s;&s;ing them, &s;hould they ever attempt to penetrate the country. Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider the mea&s;ure: and if they determine to adopt it, I conceive it will be nece&s;&s;ary to authori&s;e and reque&s;t the General Court of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay to carry it into execution. Their &s;ituation and advantages will enable them to negociate a treaty and an alliance better than it can be done by any per&s;ons el&s;e.</P>
<P>I have been honoured with your two favours of the fir&s;t in&s;tant; and, agreeable to the wi&s;hes of Congre&s;s, &s;hall put mon&s;ieur Wiebert in the be&s;t place I can to prove his abilities in the art he profe&s;&s;es. I &s;hall &s;end him up imme|diately to the works erecting towards King&s;bridge under the di&s;cretion of general Mifflin, whom I &s;hall reque&s;t to employ him.</P>
<P>I this moment received a letter from general Greene, an extract of which I have inclo&s;ed. The intelligence it contains is of the mo&s;t important nature, and evinces the nece&s;&s;ity of the mo&s;t &s;pirited and vigorous exertions on our part.</P>
<P>The expectation of the fleet under admiral Howe is cer|tainly the rea&s;on the army already come have not begun
<PB N="174" REF="029737_0173_0FE248569C2BAF68">
their ho&s;tile operations. When that arrives, we may look for the mo&s;t intere&s;ting events, and &s;uch as, in all probabil|ity, will have con&s;iderable weight in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t. It behoves us to be prepared in the be&s;t manner: and I &s;ubmit it again to Congre&s;s, whether the accounts given by their pri&s;oners do not &s;hew the propriety of calling the &s;ev|eral continental regiments from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts govern|ment, rai&s;ing the flying camp with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, and engaging the ea&s;tern Indians.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 5.&mdash;General Mercer arrived here on Tue&s;day, and, the next morning, was ordered to Paulus-Hook to make &s;ome arrangements of the militia as they came in, and the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition he could to prevent the enemy cro&s;&s;|ing from Staten-I&s;land, if they &s;hould have any &s;uch views. The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of the inhabitants of Elizabeth-Town and Newark has &s;ince induced me, upon their appli|cation, to give up all the militia from the Jer&s;ies, except tho&s;e engaged for &s;ix months. I am hopeful they will be able to repel any incur&s;ions that may be attempted. Gen|erals Mercer and Living&s;ton are concerting plans for that purpo&s;e. By a letter from the latter la&s;t night, I am in|formed the enemy are throwing up &s;mall works at all the pa&s;&s;es on the north &s;ide of Staten-I&s;land, which it is prob|able they mean to &s;ecure.</P>
<P>None of the Connecticut militia are yet arrived: &s;o that the reinforcement we have received is very incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>A letter from general Schuyler, with &s;undry inclo&s;ures, (of which N^o 1, 2 and 3 are exact copies) this moment came to hand, and will no doubt claim, as it ought to do, the immediate attention of Congre&s;s. The evils which mu&s;t inevitably follow a di&s;puted command, are too obvi|ous and alarming to admit a moment's delay in your deci|&s;ion thereupon: and, although I do not pre&s;ume to advi&s;e in a matter, now, of this delicacy, yet as it appears evi|dent that the northern army has retreated to Crown-Point, and mean to act upon the defen&s;ive only, I cannot help giving it as my opinion that one of the major-gener|als in that quarter would be more u&s;efully employed here, or in the flying camp, than there: for it becomes my du|ty to ob&s;erve, if another experienced officer is taken from hence in order to command the flying camp, that your

grand army will be entirely &s;tripped of generals who have &s;een &s;ervice,&mdash;being in a manner already de&s;titute of &s;uch. My di&s;tre&s;s on this account,&mdash;the appointment of general Whitcomb to the ea&s;tern regiments,&mdash;a convic|tion in my own brea&s;t that no troops will be &s;ent to Bo&s;|ton,&mdash;and the certainty of a number coming to this place,&mdash;occa&s;ioned my po&s;tponing, from time to time, &s;ending any general officer from hence to the ea&s;tward heretofore: and now I &s;hall wait the &s;entiments of Congre&s;s relative to the five regiments in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, before I do any thing in this matter.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ary-general has been with me this morning concerning the other matter contained in general Schuy|ler's letter re&s;pecting the bu&s;ine&s;s of that department. He has, I believe, (in order to remove difficulties) re|called Mr. Avery, but &s;eems to think it nece&s;&s;ary in that ca&s;e that Mr. Living&s;ton &s;hould be left to him&s;elf, as he cannot be re&s;pon&s;ible for per&s;ons not of his own appoint|ment. This matter &s;hould al&s;o be clearly defined by Congre&s;s. I have already given my opinion of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the&s;e matters being under one general direction, in &s;o full and clear a manner, that I &s;hall not take up the time of Congre&s;s to repeat it in this place.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your two favours of the fourth and &s;ixth in&s;tant, which came duly to hand, with their important inclo&s;ures.</P>
<P>I perceive that Congre&s;s have been employed in delib|erating on mea&s;ures of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting nature. It is certain that it is not with us to determine in many in|&s;tances what con&s;equences will flow from our councils: but yet it behoves us to adopt &s;uch, as, under t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;miles of a gracious and all-kind Providence, will be mo&s;t likely to promote our happine&s;s. I tru&s;t the late deci&s;ive part they have taken is calculated for that end, and will &s;ecure us that freedom and tho&s;e privileges, which have been and are refu&s;ed us, contrary to the voice of nature and the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. Agreeable to the reque&s;t of Congre&s;s, I cau&s;ed "THE DECLARATION" to be proclaimed before all the army under my immediate com|mand; and have the plea&s;ure to inform them that the mea&s;ure &s;eemed to have their mo&s;t hearty a&s;&s;ent,&mdash;the ex|pre&s;&s;ions and behaviour, both of officers and men, te&s;tify|ing their warme&s;t approbation of it. I have tran&s;mitted a copy to general Ward at Bo&s;ton, reque&s;ting him to have it proclaimed to the continental troops in that de|partment.</P>
<P>It is with great plea&s;ure that I hear the militia from Maryland, the Delaware government, and Penn&s;ylvania, will be in motion every day to form the flying camp. It is of great importance, and &s;hould be accompli&s;hed with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. The readine&s;s and alacrity with which the committee of &s;afety of Penn&s;ylvania and the other conferees have acted in order to forward the a&s;&s;o|ciated militia of that State to the Jer&s;ies for &s;ervice till the men to compo&s;e the flying camp arrive, &s;trongly ev|idence their regard to the common cau&s;e, and that noth|ing on their part will be wanting to &s;upport it. I hope, and I doubt not, that the a&s;&s;ociated militia, impre&s;&s;ed with the expediency of the mea&s;ure, will immediately carry it into execution, and furni&s;h in this in&s;tance a proof of the continuance of that zeal which has &s;o eminently marked their conduct. I have directed the commi&s;&s;ary
<PB N="177" REF="029737_0176_0FE248AAB3A6A418">
to make the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion for their reception, who will al&s;o &s;upply the army for the flying camp with rations. A proper officer will be appointed to command it.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the power given me by Congre&s;s, and the advice of my general officers, I have wrote to general Ward, and de&s;ired him forthwith to detach three of the fulle&s;t regiments from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay to join the northern army,&mdash;e&s;teeming it a matter of the greate&s;t im|portance to have a &s;ufficient force there to prevent the en|emy pa&s;&s;ing the Lake and making an impre&s;&s;ion in that quarter. The gondolas and gallies will be of great &s;er|vice; and I am hopeful the carpenters you have &s;ent from Philadelphia, and that will go from the ea&s;tward on your application, will be able to build a &s;ufficient number in time to an&s;wer every exigency.</P>
<P>I have reque&s;ted governor Cooke, if the duck men|tioned in Mr. Greene's letter is proper for tents, to have it made up as early as po&s;&s;ible, and forwarded here. I have al&s;o de&s;ired him to &s;end the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lints and &s;mall arms, as I have general Ward tho&s;e of the latter that were tak|en out of the Scotch tran&s;ports,&mdash;our deficiency in the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary articles being &s;till great.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving that Congre&s;s have particularly mentioned a bounty of ten dollars, to be paid to men of &s;ome corps directed to be rai&s;ed in two or three in&s;tances &s;ince their re&s;olve of the twenty-&s;ixth of June, allowing &s;uch boun|ty, I have been led to doubt how that re&s;olve is to be con&s;trued; whether it is a general regulation, and ex|tends to all men that will engage for three years,&mdash;for in|&s;tance, the &s;oliders of the pre&s;ent army, if they will en|li&s;t for that time. If it is, and extends to them, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to forward a large &s;um of money: many per|haps would engage.</P>
<P>I al&s;o ob&s;erve, by their re&s;olve of the twenty-fifth of June for rai&s;ing four regiments of militia in the ea&s;tern governments to augment the troops in the northern de|partment, that the a&s;&s;emblies of tho&s;e governments are em|powered to appoint payma&s;ters to the &s;aid regiments. This appears to me a regulation of great u&s;e, and I could wi&s;h that it was made general, and one allowed to eve|ry
<PB N="178" REF="029737_0177_0FE24859F30C2938">
regiment in the &s;ervice. Many advantages would re|&s;ult from it.</P>
<P>The Connecticut militia begin to come in: but from every account the battalions will be very incomplete, owing, they &s;ay, to the bu&s;y &s;ea&s;on of the year. That government, le&s;t any inconvenience might re&s;ult from their militia not being here in time, ordered three regi|ments of their light-hor&s;e to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, part of which have arrived. But, not having the means to &s;upport them (and, if it could be done, the expen&s;e would be enormous) I have thanked the gentlemen for their zeal, and the at|tachment they have manife&s;ted upon this occa&s;ion, and informed them that I cannot con&s;ent to their keeping their hor&s;es,&mdash;at the &s;ame time wi&s;hing them to &s;tay them&s;elves. I am told they or part of them mean to do &s;o.</P>
<P>General Mercer is now in the Jer&s;ies, for the purpo&s;e of receiving and ordering the militia coming for the flying camp: and I have &s;ent over our chief engineer to view the ground within the neighbourhood of Amboy, and to lay out &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary works for the encampment, and &s;uch as may be proper at the different pa&s;&s;es in Bergen-Neck, and other places on the Jer&s;ey &s;hore oppo&s;ite Staten-I&s;land, to prevent the enemy making impre&s;|&s;ions, and committing depredations on the property of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>The intelligence we have from a few de&s;erters that have come over to us, and from others, is that general Howe has between nine and ten thou&s;and men, who are chiefly landed on the i&s;land, po&s;ted in different parts, and &s;ecuring the &s;everal communications from the Jer&s;ies with &s;mall works and intrenchments, to prevent our people from paying them a vi&s;it;&mdash;that the i&s;landers have all joined them, &s;eem well di&s;po&s;ed to favour their cau&s;e, and have agreed to take up arms in their behalf. They look for admiral Howe's arrival every day with his fleet and a large reinforcement; are in high &s;pirits, and talk confi|dently of &s;ucce&s;s, and carrying all before them when he comes. I tru&s;t, through divine favour and our own exer|tions, they will be di&s;appointed in their views: and, at all events, any advantages they may gain will co&s;t them

very dear. If our troops will behave well (which I hope will be the ca&s;e, having every thing to contend for that freemen hold dear) they will have to wade through much blood and &s;laughter before they can carry any part of our works, if they carry them at all,&mdash;and, at be&s;t, be in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a melancholy and mournful victory. May the &s;acredne&s;s of our cau&s;e in&s;pire our &s;oldiery with &s;entiments of heroi&s;m, and lead them to the performance of the no|ble&s;t exploits!&mdash;</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honoured with your favour of the eighth in|&s;tant by ye&s;terday morning's po&s;t, with the &s;everal re&s;olves to which you referred my attention. I &s;hall duly regard them, and attempt their execution as far as I am able.</P>
<P>By virtue of the di&s;cretionary power that Congre&s;s were plea&s;ed to ve&s;t me with, and by advice of &s;uch of my gen|eral officers as I have had an opportunity of con&s;ulting, I have ordered the two remaining continental regiments in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay to march immediately for the defence of this place, in full confidence that nothing ho&s;tile will be attempted again&s;t that State in the pre&s;ent campaign.</P>
<P>I have wrote to the General Court of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, and tran&s;mitted a copy of the re&s;olve for employing the ea&s;tern Indians, entreating their good offices in this in&s;tance, and their exertions to have them forthwith engaged and marched to join this army. I have de&s;ired five or &s;ix hun|dred of them to be enli&s;ted for two or three years, if they will con&s;ent to it,&mdash;&s;ubject to an earlier di&s;charge if it &s;hall be thought nece&s;&s;ary,&mdash;and upon the &s;ame terms as the con|tinental troops, if better cannot be had,&mdash;though I am hopeful they may.</P>
<P>In my letter of ye&s;terday, I mentioned the arrival of part of the Connecticut light-hor&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the defence of this place, and my objection to their hor&s;es being kept. Four or five hundred of them are now come in; and, in ju&s;tice to their zeal and laudable attachment to the cau&s;e of
<PB N="180" REF="029737_0179_0FE2485B76CF6EE0">
their country, I am to inform you that they have con&s;ented to &s;tay as long as occa&s;ion may require, though they &s;hould be at the expen&s;e of maintaining their hor&s;es them&s;elves. They have pa&s;tured them out about the neighbourhood of King&s;bridge (being unwilling to &s;end them away) at the rate of half a dollar per week each, meaning to leave in en|tirely with Congre&s;s either to allow or refu&s;e it, as they &s;hall judge proper. I promi&s;ed to make this repre&s;entation and thought it my duty; and will only ob&s;erve that the motives which induced them at fir&s;t to &s;et out were good and prai&s;e-worthy, and were, to afford the mo&s;t &s;peedy and early &s;uccour, which they apprehended would be wanted before the militia arrived. Their &s;ervices may be extreme|ly important,&mdash;being mo&s;t of them, if not all, men of rep|utation and of property.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of the inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from gover|nor Trumbull I beg leave to &s;ubmit to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s. They will perceive from his repre&s;entation the di&s;quieting apprehen&s;ions that have &s;eized on the minds of the people &s;ince the retreat of the northern army, and how expo&s;ed the northern frontiers of New-York and New-Hamp&s;hire are to the ravages and incur&s;ions of the Indians. How far it may be expedient to rai&s;e the battalion he con|ceives nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the calamities and di&s;tre&s;&s;es he points out, they will determine, upon what he has &s;aid, and the nece&s;&s;ity that may appear to them for the mea&s;ure;&mdash;what I have done, being only to lay the matter before them in compliance with his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o inclo&s;ed a memorial from the &s;urgeons'-mates, &s;etting forth the inadequacy of their pay to their &s;er|vices and maintenance, and praying that it may be increa&s;|ed. I &s;hall ob&s;erve that they have a long time complained in this in&s;tance, and that &s;ome additional allowance may not be unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>As I am truly &s;en&s;ible the time of Congre&s;s is much taken up with a variety of important matters, it is with un|willingne&s;s and pain I ever repeat a reque&s;t after having once made it, or take the liberty of enforcing any opinion of mine after it is once given: but as the e&s;tabli&s;hing of &s;ome office for auditing accounts is a matter of exceeding importance to the public intere&s;t, I would beg leave once
<PB N="181" REF="029737_0180_0FE248B601610ED0">
mere to call the attention of Congre&s;s to an appointment competent to the purpo&s;e. Two motives induce me to urge the matter; fir&s;t, a conviction of the utility of the mea&s;|ure&mdash;&s;econdly, that I may &s;tand exculpated if hereafter it &s;hould appear that money has been improperly expended, and nece&s;&s;aries for the army obtained upon unrea&s;onable terms.</P>
<P>For me, who&s;e time is employed from the hour of my ri&s;ing till I retire to bed again, to go into an examination of the accounts of &s;uch an army as this with any degree of preci&s;ion and exactne&s;s, without neglecting other matters of equal importance, is utterly impracticable. All that I have been able to do (and that, in fact, was doing nothing) was, when the commi&s;&s;ary, and quarter-ma&s;ter, and director-general of the ho&s;pital (for it is to the&s;e the great advances are made) applied for warrants,&mdash;to make them at times produce a general account of their expenditures. But this an&s;wers no valuable purpo&s;e. It is the minutiae that mu&s;t be gone into,&mdash;the propriety of each charge examined,&mdash;the vouchers looked into;&mdash;and, with re&s;pect to the com|mi&s;&s;ary-general, his victualling returns and expenditures of provi&s;ions &s;hould be compared with his purcha&s;es: other|wi&s;e a per&s;on in this department, if he was inclined to be knavi&s;h, might purcha&s;e large quantities with the public money, and fell one half of it again for private emolument; and yet his accounts upon paper would appear fair, and be &s;upported with vouchers for every charge.</P>
<P>I do not urge this matter from a &s;u&s;picion of any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nfair practices in either of the departments before mentioned; and &s;orry &s;hould I be if this con&s;truction was put upon it, having a high opinion of the honour and integrity of the&s;e gentlemen. But there &s;hould neverthele&s;s be &s;ome con|trol as well upon their di&s;cretion as hone&s;ty:&mdash;to which may be added, that accounts become perplexed and con|fu&s;ed by long &s;tanding, and the errors therein not &s;o di&s;|coverable as if they underwent an early revi&s;ion and exam|ination. I am well appri&s;ed that a trea&s;ury-office of ac|counts has been re&s;olved upon, and an auditor-general for &s;ettling all public accounts: but, with all deference and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the opinion of Congre&s;s, the&s;e in&s;titutions are not calculated to prevent the inconveniences I have men|tioned;
<PB N="182" REF="029737_0181_0FE248629C6D6B88">
nor can they be competent to the purpo&s;es, circum|&s;tanced as they are.</P>
<P>We have intelligence from a de&s;erter that came to us, that on Wedne&s;day morning the A&s;ia, Chatham, and Grey|hound men-of-war weighed anchor, and (it was &s;aid) in|tended to pa&s;s up the North-river above the city, to pre|vent the communication with the Jer&s;ies. They did not attempt it, nor does he know what prevented them. A pri&s;oner belonging to the tenth regiment, taken ye&s;terday, informs that they hourly expected admiral Howe and his fleet. He adds that a ve&s;&s;el has arrived from them, and the prevailing opinion is, that an attack will be ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> im|mediately on their arrival.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Ward, I am informed that the &s;mall-pox has broke out at Bo&s;ton, and infected &s;ome of the troops. I have wrote to him to place the invalids under an officer, to remain till they are well; and to u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible precaution to prevent the troops from thence bringing the infection. The di&s;tre&s;&s;es and calam|ities we have already &s;uffered by this di&s;order in one part of our army, I hope, will excite his utmo&s;t care that they may not be increa&s;ed.</P>

<P>The de&s;ign of this is to inform Congre&s;s, that, about half after three o'clock this evening, two of the enemy's &s;hips of war, one of forty and the other of twenty guns, with three tenders, weighed anchor in the bay oppo&s;ite Staten-I&s;land, and, availing them&s;elves of a bri&s;k and fa|vourable breeze, with a flowing tide, ran pa&s;t our batteries up the North-river, without receiving any certain damage that I could perceive, notwith&s;tanding a heavy and ince&s;|&s;ant cannonade was kept up from our &s;everal batteries here, as well as from that at Paulus-Hook. They, on their part, returned and continued the fire as they ran by. I di&s;patched an expre&s;s to brigadier-general Mifflin, at our encampment towards the upper end of the i&s;land;
<PB N="183" REF="029737_0182_0FE248B7B8070868">
but have not heard whether they have got by, or received any damage.</P>
<P>The account tran&s;mitted by this morning's po&s;t, re|&s;pecting the arrival of one of the fleet, &s;eems to be confirm|ed. Several &s;hips have come in to-day: among them, one this evening, with a Saint-George's flag at her fore-top-ma&s;t-head, which we conclude to be admiral Howe, from the circum&s;tance of the flag, and the &s;everal and gen|eral &s;alutes that were paid. It is probable they will all arrive in a day or two, and immediately begin their ope|rations.</P>
<P>As it will be extremely nece&s;&s;ary that the flying camp &s;hould be well provided with powder and ball, and it may be impracticable to &s;end &s;upplies from hence on account of our hurry and engagements, (be&s;ides, the communication may be uncertain) I mu&s;t beg the attention of Congre&s;s to this matter, and reque&s;t that they will forward with all po&s;&s;ible expedition &s;uch a quantity of mu&s;ket-powder and lead, (if balls of different &s;izes cannot be had) as will be &s;ufficient for the militia to compo&s;e that camp.</P>
<P>By an expre&s;s this minute arrived from general Mifflin, the &s;hips have pa&s;&s;ed his works.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>My la&s;t of Friday evening, which I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you, advi&s;ed that two of the enemy's &s;hips of war and three tenders had run above our batteries here and the works at the upper end of the i&s;land. I am now to inform you, that, ye&s;terday forenoon, receiving intelli|gence from general Mifflin that they had pa&s;&s;ed the Tap|pan-Sea, and were trying to proceed higher up,&mdash;by advice of R. R. Living&s;ton, e&s;quire, and other gentlemen, I di&s;|patched expre&s;&s;es to general Clinton of Ul&s;ter, and the committee of &s;afety for Duche&s;s-county, to take mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring the pa&s;&s;es in the Highlands, le&s;t they might have de&s;igns of &s;eizing them, and have a force concealed
<PB N="184" REF="029737_0183_0FE2486567F5F330">
for the purpo&s;e. I wrote the evening before to the com|manding officer of the two garri&s;ons there to be vigilant and prepared again&s;t any attempts they or any di&s;affected per&s;ons might make again&s;t them, and to forward expre&s;|&s;es all the way to Albany, that provi&s;ion and other ve&s;&s;els might be &s;ecured and prevented falling into their hands.</P>
<P>The information given general Mifflin was rather pre|mature, as to their having gone pa&s;t the Sea. A letter from the committee of Orange-county, which came to hand this morning, &s;ays they were there ye&s;terday, and that a regiment of their militia was under arms, to prevent their landing and making an incur&s;ion. The me&s;&s;enger who brought it, and to whom it refers for particulars, adds that a party of them, in two or three boats, had approach|ed the &s;hore, but were forced back by our people firing at them. Since the manoeuvre of Friday, there have been no other movements in the fleet.</P>
<P>General Sullivan, in a letter of the &s;econd in&s;tant, in|forms me of his arrival with the army at Crown-Point, where he is fortifying and throwing up works. He adds that he has &s;ecured all the &s;tores except three cannon left at Chamblee, which in part is made up by taking a fine twelve-pounder out of the Lake. The army is &s;ickly,&mdash;many with the &s;mall-pox; and he is apprehen&s;ive the militia, ordered to join them, will not e&s;cape the infection. An officer he had &s;ent to reconnoitre had reported that he &s;aw at Saint John's about a hundred and fifty tents,&mdash;twenty at Saint Roy's, and fifteen at Chamblee; and works at the fir&s;t were bu&s;ily carrying on.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a general return of the army here, which will &s;hew the whole of our &s;trength. All the detached po&s;ts are included.</P>
<P>A letter from the ea&s;tward, by la&s;t night's po&s;t, to Mr. Hazard, po&s;t-ma&s;ter in this city, advi&s;es that two &s;hips had been taken and carried into Cape-Ann,&mdash;one from Antigua, con&s;igned to general Howe, with four hundred and thirty-nine puncheons of rum,&mdash;the other a Jamaica|man, with four hundred hog&s;heads of &s;ugar, two hundred puncheons of rum, thirty-nine bales of cotton, pimento, fu&s;tic, &amp;c. &amp;c. Each mounted two guns, &s;ix-pounders.</P>
<P>About three o'clock this afternoon I was informed that
<PB N="185" REF="029737_0184_0FE248B941388000">
a flag from lord Howe was coming up, and waited with two of our whale-boats, until directions &s;hould be given. I immediately convened &s;uch of the general officers as were not upon other duty, who agreed in opinion that I ought not to receive any letter directed to me as a private gentleman: but if otherwi&s;e, and the officer de&s;ired to come up to deliver the letter him&s;elf, as was &s;ugge&s;ted, he &s;hould come under a &s;afe-conduct. Upon this, I directed colonel Reed to go down and manage the affair under the above general in&s;truction.</P>
<P>On his return, he informed me, that, after the common civilities, the officer acquainted him that he had a letter from lord Howe to Mr. Wa&s;hington, which he &s;hewed un|der a &s;uper&s;cription, <HI>"To George Wa&s;hington, e&s;quire."</HI> Colonel Reed replied there was no &s;uch per&s;on in the ar|my, and that a letter intended for the general could not be received under &s;uch a direction. The officer expre&s;&s;ed great concern,&mdash;&s;aid it was a letter rather of a civil than military nature,&mdash;that lord Howe regretted he had not ar|rived &s;ooner,&mdash;that he (lord Howe) had great powers. The anxiety to have the letter received was very evident, though the officer di&s;claimed all knowledge of its contents. However, colonel Reed's in&s;tructions being po&s;itive, they parted. After they had got &s;ome di&s;tance, the officer with the flag again put about, and a&s;ked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">der what direc|tion Mr. Wa&s;hington cho&s;e to be addre&s;&s;ed:&mdash;to which colonel Reed an&s;wered, his &s;tation was well known, and that certainly they could be at no lo&s;s how to direct to him. The officer &s;aid they knew it and lamented it; and again repeated his wi&s;h that the letter could be received. Colonel Reed told him a proper direction would obviate all difficulties, and that this was no new matter,&mdash;this &s;ub|ject having been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year; of which lord Howe could not be ignorant:&mdash;upon which they parted.</P>
<P>I would not upon any occa&s;ion &s;acrifice e&s;&s;entials to punc|tilio: but in this in&s;tance, the opinion of others concurring with my own, I deemed it a duty to my country and my appointment, to in&s;i&s;t upon that re&s;pect, which, in any oth|er than a public view, I would willingly have waved. Nor do I doubt, but, from the &s;uppo&s;ed nature of the me&s;&s;age,
<PB N="186" REF="029737_0185_0FE24866ED15F630">
and the anxiety expre&s;&s;ed, they will ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">her repeat their flag, or fall upon &s;ome mode to communicate the import and <HI>[contents]</HI> of it.</P>
<P>I have been duly honoured with your two letters, that of the tenth by Mr. Ander&s;on,&mdash;and the eleventh, with its inclo&s;ures. I have directed the quarter-ma&s;ter to pro|vide him with every thing he wants to carry his &s;cheme in|to execution. It is an important one, and I wi&s;h it &s;uc|ce&s;s; but am doubtful that it will be better in theory than practice.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age of the &s;hips of war and tenders up the river is a matter of great importance, and has excited much con|jecture and &s;peculation. To me two things have occurred, as leading them to this proceeding,&mdash;fir&s;t a de&s;ign to &s;eize on the narrow pa&s;&s;es on both &s;ides of the river, giving almo&s;t the only land-communication with Albany, and of con&s;e|quence with our northern army; for which purpo&s;e they might have troops concealed on board, which they deemed competent of them&s;elves, as the defiles are narrow,&mdash;or that they would be joined by many di&s;affected per&s;ons in that quarter. Others have added a probability of their having a large quantity of arms on board, to be in readi|ne&s;s to put into the hands of the tories immediately on the arrival of the fleet, or rather at the time they intend to make their attack. The &s;econd is, to cut off entirely all intercour&s;e between this and Albany by water, and the up|per country, and to prevent &s;upplies of every kind going and coming.</P>
<P>The&s;e matters are truly alarming, and of &s;uch importance that I have wrote to the provincial Congre&s;s of New-York, and recommended to their &s;erious con&s;ideration the adoption of every po&s;&s;ible expedient to guard again&s;t the two fir&s;t; and have &s;ugge&s;ted the propriety of their employing the militia, or &s;ome part of them, in the counties in which the&s;e defiles are, to keep the enemy from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them, till further provi&s;ion can be made; and to write to the &s;ev|eral leading per&s;ons on our &s;ide in that quarter, to be atten|tive to all the movements of the &s;hips and the di&s;affected, in order to di&s;cover and fru&s;trate whatever pernicious &s;chemes they have in view.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="029737_0186_0FE1BFA1EEDB29B8">
In re&s;pect to the &s;econd conjecture of my own, and which &s;eems to be generally adopted, I have the plea&s;ure to in|form Congre&s;s, that, if their de&s;ign is to keep the armies from provi&s;ion, the commi&s;&s;ary has told me upon inquiry, he has forwarded &s;upplies to Albany (now there, and above it) &s;ufficient for ten thou&s;and men for four months; that he has a &s;ufficiency here for twenty thou&s;and men for three months, and an abundant quantity &s;ecured in differ|ent parts of the Jer&s;ies for the flying camp, be&s;ides having about four thou&s;and barrels of flour in &s;ome neighbouring part of Connecticut.

<P>THIS will be handed you by Mr. Griffin, who has al&s;o taken upon him the charge and delivery of two pack|ets containing &s;undry letters which were &s;ent to Amboy ye&s;terday by a flag, and forwarded to me to-day by gen|eral Mercer.

<P>The inhuman treatment of the whole, and murder of part of our people, after their &s;urrender and capitulation, was certainly a flagrant violation of that faith which ought to be held &s;acred by all civilized nations, and founded in the mo&s;t &s;avage barbarity.

<P>I WAS this morning honoured with yours of the fifteenth in&s;tant, with &s;undry re&s;olves.</P>
<P>I perceive the mea&s;ures Congre&s;s have taken to expe|dite the rai&s;ing of the flying camp, and providing it with articles of the greate&s;t u&s;e. You will &s;ee by a po&s;t&s;cript to my letter of the fourteenth, I had wrote to the com|manding officer of the Penn&s;ylvania militia, ordering them to be marched from Trenton to Amboy, as their remain|ing there could not an&s;wer the lea&s;t public good. For, having con&s;ulted with &s;undry gentlemen, I was informed, if the enemy mean to direct their views towards Penn&s;yl|vania or penetrate the Jer&s;ies, their route will be from near Amboy, and either by way of Brun&s;wic or Bound-brook,&mdash;the lower road from South-Amboy being through a woody, &s;andy country. Be&s;ides, they will be then able to throw in &s;uccour here, and to receive it from hence in ca&s;es of emergency.</P>
<P>The Connecticut light-hor&s;e, mentioned in my letter of the eleventh, notwith&s;tanding their then promi&s;e to continue here for the defence of this place, are now di&s;|charged, and about to return home,&mdash;having peremptorily refu&s;ed all kind of fatigue duty, or even to mount guard, claiming an exemption as troopers. Though their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance is much needed, and might be of e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice in ca&s;e of an attack, yet I judged it advi&s;eable, on their ap|plication and claim of &s;uch indulgences, to di&s;charge them; as granting them would &s;et an example to others, and might produce many ill con&s;equences. The number of men included in the la&s;t return, by this, is le&s;&s;ened about five hundred.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="029737_0188_0FE248C45B759A20">
I la&s;t night received a letter from general Schuyler, with &s;everal inclo&s;ures, copies of which I have herewith tran&s;mitted. They will give Congre&s;s every information I have re&s;pecting our northern army and the &s;ituation of our affairs in that quarter;&mdash;to which I beg leave to re|fer their attention. I cannot but expre&s;s my &s;urpri&s;e at the &s;carcity of provi&s;ion which general Schuyler mentions, after what the commi&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;ured me, and which formed a part of my letter of the fourteenth. He &s;till a&s;&s;ures me of the &s;ame. This is a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tance, as every article of provi&s;ion, and every thing nece&s;&s;ary for that de|partment, can have no other now than a land-conveyance, the water-communication from hence to Albany being en|tirely cut off.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s will plea&s;e to con&s;ider the inclo&s;ure, N^o 6, about rai&s;ing &s;ix companies out of the inhabitants about the Lakes, to prevent the incur&s;ions of the Indians. The general officers, in their minutes of council, have deter|mined it a matter of much importance;&mdash;and their atten|tion to the price of goods furni&s;hed the &s;oldiery may be extremely nece&s;&s;ary. They have complained much upon this head.</P>
<P>The retreat from Crown-Point &s;eems to be con&s;idered in oppo&s;ite views by the general and field officers. The former (I am &s;atisfied) have weighed the matter well; and yet the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned by the latter again&s;t it appear &s;trong and forcible. I hope whatever is done will be for the be&s;t. * * *</P>
<P>By a letter from the committee of Orange-county, re|ceived this morning, the men-of-war and tenders were ye&s;|terday at Haver&s;ham-bay, about forty miles above this. A number of men, in four barges from the tenders, at|tempted to land, with a view (they &s;uppo&s;e) of taking &s;ome &s;heep and cattle, that had been previou&s;ly removed. A &s;mall number of militia that were collected obliged them to retreat, without their doing any damage with their cannon. They were &s;ounding the water up towards the Highlands; by which it is probable they will attempt to pa&s;s with part of the fleet, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday evening a flag came from general Howe with a letter addre&s;&s;ed "<HI>To George Wa&s;hington, e&s;quire, &amp;c.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favours of the &s;ixteenth and &s;eventeenth, with the &s;everal re&s;olves they contained; to the execution of which, &s;o far as &s;hall be in my power, I will pay proper attention.</P>
<P>In my letter of the &s;eventeenth I tran&s;mitted you a copy of one from general Schuyler, and of its &s;everal in|clo&s;ures. I confe&s;s the determination of the council of general officers on the &s;eventh, to retreat from Crown-Point, &s;urpri&s;ed me much: and the more I con&s;ider it, the more &s;triking does the impropriety appear. The rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned again&s;t it by the field-officers, in their re|mon&s;trance, coincide greatly with my own ideas and tho&s;e of the other general officers I have had an opportunity of con&s;ulting with, and &s;eem to be of con&s;iderable weight,&mdash;I may add, conclu&s;ive. I am not &s;o fully acquainted with the geography of that country and the &s;ituation of the different po&s;ts, as to pronounce a peremptory judg|ment upon the matter: but, if my ideas are right, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Crown-Point is e&s;&s;ential, to give us the &s;u|periority and ma&s;tery upon the Lake.</P>
<P>That the enemy will po&s;&s;e&s;s it as &s;oon as abandoned by us, there can be no doubt; and if they do, whatever gallies or force we keep on the Lake will be unque&s;tiona|bly in their rear. How they are to be &s;upported there, or what &s;uccour can be drawn from them there, is beyond my comprehen&s;ion. Perhaps it is only meant that they &s;hall be employed on the communication between that and Ticonderoga. If this is the ca&s;e, I fear the views of Con|gre&s;s will not be an&s;wered, nor the &s;alutary effects be de|rived from them, that were intended.</P>
<P>I have mentioned my &s;urpri&s;e to general Schuyler, and would, by the advice of the general officers here, have directed that that po&s;t &s;hould be maintained, had it not been for two cau&s;es,&mdash;an apprehen&s;ion that the works
<PB N="191" REF="029737_0190_0FE248C614C9DA88">
have been de&s;troyed, and that, if the army &s;hould be or|dered from Ticonderoga, or the po&s;t oppo&s;ite to it (where I pre&s;ume they are) to repo&s;&s;e&s;s it, they would have nei|ther one place nor another &s;ecure and in a defen&s;ible &s;tate: the other, le&s;t it might increa&s;e the jealou&s;y and diver&s;ity of opinions which &s;eem already too prevalent in that ar|my, and e&s;tabli&s;h a precedent for the inferior officers to &s;et up their judgments whenever they would, in oppo&s;i|tion to tho&s;e of their &s;uperiors,&mdash;a matter of great deli|cacy, and that might lead to fatal con&s;equences, if coun|tenanced;&mdash;though in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance I could wi&s;h their rea&s;oning had prevailed.</P>
<P>If the army has not removed, what I have &s;aid to gen|eral Schuyler may perhaps bring on a recon&s;ideration of the matter; and it may not be too late to take mea&s;ures for maintaining that po&s;t. But of this I have no hope.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the re&s;olve of Congre&s;s for three of the ea&s;tern regiments to reinforce the northern army, I wrote to general Ward, and, by advice of my gen|eral officers, directed them to march to Norwich, and there to embark for Albany; conceiving that two val|uable purpo&s;es might re&s;ult therefrom,&mdash;fir&s;t, that they would &s;ooner join the army, by pur&s;uing this route, and be &s;aved from the di&s;tre&s;s and fatigue that mu&s;t attend every long march through the country at this hot and un|comfortable &s;ea&s;on; and &s;econdly, that they might give &s;uccour here, in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould make an attack about the time of their pa&s;&s;ing. But the enemy having now, with their &s;hips of war and tenders, cut off the water-communication from the hence to Albany, I have wrote this day and directed them to proceed by land acro&s;s the country. If Congre&s;s di&s;approve the route, or wi&s;h to give any orders about them, you will plea&s;e to certify me thereof, that I may take mea&s;ures accordingly.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed I have the honour to tran&s;mit you copies of a letter and &s;undry re&s;olutions which I received ye&s;terday from the convention of this State. By them you will per|ceive they have been acting upon matters of great impor|tance, and are exerting them&s;elves in the mo&s;t vigorous manner to defeat the wicked de&s;igns of the enemy, and &s;uch di&s;affected per&s;ons as may incline to a&s;&s;i&s;t and facili|tate
<PB N="192" REF="029737_0191_0FE24871E69906F8">
their news. In compliance with their reque&s;t, and on account of the &s;carcity of money for carrying their &s;alutary views into execution, I have agreed to lend them, out of the &s;mall &s;tock now in hand, (not more than &s;ixty thou&s;and dollars) twenty thou&s;and dollars, in part of what they want; which they promi&s;e &s;peedily to re|place. Had there been money &s;ufficient for paying the whole of our troops and no more, I could not have done it. But as it was otherwi&s;e, and by no means proper to pay a part and not the whole, I could not fore&s;ee any in|conveniences that would attend the loan;&mdash;on the con|trary, that it might contribute in &s;ome degree to forward their &s;chemes. I hope my conduct in this in&s;tance will not be di&s;approved.</P>
<P>I inclo&s;ed governor Trumbull a copy of their letter and of their &s;everal re&s;olves, to-day, by colonel Broom and Mr. Duer, two members of the convention, who are go|ing to wait on him; but did not think my&s;elf at liberty to urge or reque&s;t his intere&s;t in forming the camp of &s;ix thou&s;and men, as the levies, directed by Congre&s;s to be furni&s;hed the third of June, for the defence of this place, by that government, are but little more than one third come in. At the &s;ame time, the propo&s;ition I think a good one, if it could be carried into execution. In ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould attempt to effect a landing above King&s;bridge, and to cut off the communication between this city and the country, an army to hang on their rear would di&s;tre&s;s them exceedingly.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favours of the eighteenth and nineteenth, with which you have been plea&s;ed to honour me, have been duly received, with the &s;everal re&s;olves alluded to.</P>
<P>When the letter and declaration, from lord Howe to Mr. Franklin and the other late governors, come to be pub|li&s;hed, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the warme&s;t advocates for depend|ence on the Briti&s;h crown mu&s;t be &s;ilent, and be convinc|ed beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, that all that has been &s;aid about the commi&s;&s;ioners was illu&s;ory, and calculated expre&s;sly to deceive and unguard, not only the good peo|ple of our own country, but tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h nation that were aver&s;e to the proceedings of the king and mini&s;|try. Hence we &s;ee the cau&s;e why a &s;pecification of their powers was not given the mayor and city of London, on their addre&s;s reque&s;ting it. That would have been danger|ous, becau&s;e it would then have been manife&s;t that the line of conduct they were to pur&s;ue would be totally variant from that they had indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated, and amu&s;ed the public with. The uniting the civil and military offices in the &s;ame per&s;ons too, mu&s;t be conclu&s;ive to every think|ing one, that there is to be but little negociation of the civil kind.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed, for the &s;atisfaction of Congre&s;s, the &s;ub|&s;tance of what pa&s;&s;ed between my&s;elf and lieutenant-colo|nel Patter&s;on, adjutant-general, at an interview had ye&s;ter|day
<PB N="194" REF="029737_0193_0FE248736BD9FB90">
in con&s;equence of a reque&s;t from general Howe the day before;&mdash;to which I beg leave to refer them for par|ticulars.</P>
<P>Colonel Knox of the train having often mentioned to me the nece&s;&s;ity of having a much more numerous body of artilleri&s;ts than what there now is, in ca&s;e the pre&s;ent con|te&s;t &s;hould continue longer,&mdash;and knowing the deficiency in this in&s;tance, and their extreme u&s;efulne&s;s,&mdash;I de&s;ired him to commit his ideas upon the &s;ubject to writing, in or|der that I might tran&s;mit them to Congre&s;s for their con|&s;ideration. Agreeable to my reque&s;t, he has done it; and the propriety of his plan is now &s;ubmitted for their deci&s;ion. It is certain that we have not more at this time than are &s;ufficient for the &s;everal exten&s;ive po&s;ts we now have,&mdash;including the draughts which he &s;peaks of, and which, I pre&s;ume (not only from what he has informed me, but from the nature of the thing) can never be qualified to render the &s;ame &s;ervice as if they were regularly appointed and formed into a corps for that particular purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I beg leave to remind Congre&s;s that &s;ome time ago I laid before them the propo&s;als of &s;ome per&s;ons here for forming a company of light-hor&s;e; and the pre&s;ident's an|&s;wer, a little time after, intimated that the plan &s;eemed to be approved of. As tho&s;e who wanted to make up the troop are frequently pre&s;&s;ing me for an an&s;wer, I could wi&s;h to be favoured with the deci&s;ion of Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Schuyler, of the fourteenth in&s;tant, dated at Albany, he informs me, that, the day before, &s;ome de&s;perate de&s;igns of the tories in that quar|ter had been di&s;covered, the particulars of which he could not divulge, being under an oath of &s;ecrecy;&mdash;however, that &s;uch mea&s;ures had been taken, as to promi&s;e a pre|vention of the intended mi&s;chief; and that four of the con&s;pirators (among them, a ringleader) were apprehend|ed about one o'clock that morning, not far from the town. What the plot was, or who were concerned in it, is a matter I am ignorant of as yet.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the plea&s;ure of writing you by this morning's po&s;t, I was favoured with a letter from gover|nor Trumbull, a copy of which is inclo&s;ed, and to which I beg leave to refer you. In regard to the &s;tock he men|tions, I wrote to him, reque&s;ting that they might be re|moved from the i&s;lands on which they were, as I conceiv|ed it of great importance to di&s;tre&s;s the enemy as much as po&s;&s;ible in the article of fre&s;h provi&s;ion. I wi&s;h the other governments may follow his example, and have it remov|ed from the i&s;lands belonging to them re&s;pectively.</P>
<P>When the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ps of war and tenders went up the river, it was thought expedient that application &s;hould be made for the Connecticut row-gallies and tho&s;e belonging to Rhode-I&s;land, in order to attempt &s;omething for their de&s;truction. As &s;oon as they arrive we &s;hall try to employ them in &s;ome u&s;eful way,&mdash;but in what, or how &s;ucce&s;sfully, I cannot at pre&s;ent determine.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve what Mr. Trumbull &s;ays re&s;pecting the continental regiment rai&s;ing under colonel Ward. If they incline to give any orders about their de&s;|tination, you will plea&s;e to communicate them by the ear|lie&s;t opportunity, as their march will be &s;u&s;pended till they are known.</P>
<P>The orders Mr. Trumbull has given to the officers of their crui&s;ers, to &s;top provi&s;ion-ve&s;&s;els, &s;eem to be nece&s;&s;ary. We have too much rea&s;on to believe that &s;ome have gone voluntarily to the enemy, and that there are many per&s;ons who would continue to furni&s;h them with large &s;upplies: and, however upright the intentions of others may be, it will be a matter of the utmo&s;t difficulty, if not an impo&s;&s;i|bility, for any to e&s;cape falling into their hands now, as every part of the coa&s;t (it is probable) will &s;warm with their &s;aips of war and tenders. I had propo&s;ed writing to the convention of this State upon the &s;ubject before I re|ceived his letter; and am now more per&s;uaded of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of their taking &s;ome &s;teps to prevent further expor|tations down the Sound. In my next I &s;hall inform them of the intelligence received from Mr. Trumbull, and rec|ommend the matter to their attention.</P>

<P>DISAGREEABLE as it is to me and unplea&s;ing as it may be to Congre&s;s to multiply officers, I find my&s;elf under the unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;king an increa&s;e of my aides-de-camp.

<P>I WAS ye&s;terday morning honoured with your fa|vour of the twenty-fourth in&s;tant with its &s;everal inclo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">res, to which I &s;hall pay the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> attention.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="029737_0197_0FE2487DDFDED810">
The confidence Congre&s;s are plea&s;ed to repo&s;e in my judgment demands my warme&s;t acknowledgments, and they may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured it &s;hall be invariably employed, &s;o far as &s;hall be in my power, to promote their views and the public weal. * * *</P>
<P>Since my la&s;t, nothing material has occurred. Ye&s;ter|day evening report was made that eight &s;hips were &s;een in the offing, &s;tanding towards the Hook. The men-of-war and tenders are &s;till up the river. They have never attempt|ed to pa&s;s the Highland fortifications; and, a day or two ago, quitted their &s;tation, and fell down the river eight or ten miles. The vigilance and activity of the militia oppo|&s;ite where they were have prevented their landing and do|ing much injury. One poor pea&s;ant's cot they plundered and then burnt.</P>
<P>I would wi&s;h to know whether the allowance given to officers, the &s;eventeenth of January, of a dollar and one-third for every man they enli&s;t, Congre&s;s mean to extend to the officers who enli&s;t for the new army for three years. At fir&s;t it may appear wrong, or rather exorbitant, &s;uppo&s;|ing that many will be recruited out of the regiments now in &s;ervice, and under them: but the allowance will be of great u&s;e, as it will intere&s;t the officers, and call forth their exertions, which otherwi&s;e would be faint and languid. In|deed I am fearful, from the inquiries I have made, that their utmo&s;t exertions will be attended with but little &s;ucce&s;s. It is objected that the bounty of ten dollars is too low; and argued,&mdash;"if the States, furni&s;hing men for five or &s;ix months, allow con&s;iderably more, why &s;hould that be ac|cepted when the term of enli&s;tment is to be for three years." I heartily wi&s;h a bounty in land had been or could be giv|en, as was propo&s;ed &s;ome time ago. I think it would be attended with &s;alutary con&s;equences.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of my application to governor Trumbull, he has &s;ent me two row-gallies; and I expect another from him. None from governor Cooke are yet come; nor have I heard from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m on the &s;ubject. One is complete here. The fire-&s;hips are going on under Mr. Ander&s;on's direction, but rather &s;lowly; and I am preparing &s;ome ob|&s;tructions for the channel nearly oppo&s;ite the works at the upper end of this i&s;land. When all things are ready, I in|tend
<PB N="199" REF="029737_0198_0FE248D4B9AE5798">
to try, if it &s;hall &s;eem practicable, to de&s;troy the &s;hips and tenders above, and to employ the gallies, if they can be of advantage.</P>
<P>The militia for the flying camp come in but &s;lowly. By a return from general Mercer ye&s;terday, they are but little more than three thou&s;and. If they were in, or can be there &s;hortly, and the &s;ituation of the enemy remains the &s;ame, I would make &s;ome efforts to annoy them, keeping our po&s;ts here well guarded, and not putting too much to the hazard, or in any manner to the ri&s;k.</P>

<P>YOUR favour of the twenty-fourth I received on Sat|urday evening, and, agreeable to your reque&s;t, &s;hall expunge the preamble to the re&s;olution &s;ubjecting the property of &s;ubjects to the Briti&s;h crown to forfeiture and confi&s;ca|tion.</P>
<P>Our &s;tock of mu&s;ket-powder is entirely made up in car|tridges. I therefore reque&s;t that Congre&s;s will order four or five tons more of that &s;ort to be immediately forwarded; it being not only nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould have more for that purpo&s;e, but al&s;o &s;ome &s;tock to remain in barrels.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday evening Hutchin&s;on's and Sergeant's regi|ments from Bo&s;ton arrived; al&s;o two row-gallies from Rhode-I&s;land.

I &s;hall u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible precaution to prevent the infection &s;preading; and, for that purpo&s;e, have ordered them to an encampment &s;eparate and detached from the re&s;t.</P>
<P>By Saturday's report from Long-I&s;land camp, five &s;hips, a brig, and five &s;chooners, had got into the Hook; by ye&s;|terday's, two &s;hips more, and a &s;loop, were &s;tanding in. What they are, I have not been able to learn.</P>

<P>I WAS this morning honoured with your two favours of ye&s;terday's date; and, agreeable to your reque&s;t, have given Mr. Palfrey liberty to negociate your claim with Mr. Brimer, and wi&s;h it may be &s;atisfied agreeably to you.</P>
<P>I la&s;t night received a letter from general Schuyler, a copy of which I do my&s;elf the honour to tran&s;mit you. You will thereby perceive his rea&s;ons for leaving Crown-Point, and preferring the po&s;t the council of officers deter|mined to take oppo&s;ite to Ticonderoga. I am totally un|acquainted with tho&s;e &s;everal po&s;ts and the country about them, and therefore cannot determine on the validity of his ob&s;ervations, or think my&s;elf at liberty to give any di|rection in the matter.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve what he &s;ays of their di&s;|tre&s;s for money. From hence he can have no relief, there being only about three or four thou&s;and dollars in the pay|ma&s;ter's hands, according to his return this morning,&mdash;and all but two months pay due to the army, be&s;ides many other demands. I could wi&s;h that proper &s;upplies of money could be always kept:&mdash;the want may occa&s;ion con&s;equen|ces of an alarming nature.</P>
<P>By a letter from him, of a prior date to the copy inclo&s;|ed, he tells me that a Mr. Ryckman, who has ju&s;t returned through the country of the Six-Nations, reports that the Indians who were at Philadelphia have gone home with very favourable ideas of our &s;trength and re&s;ources. This he heard in many of their villages:&mdash;a lucky circum&s;tance if it will either gain their friend&s;hip or &s;ecure their neu|trality.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="029737_0200_0FE249277047DD00">
In my letter of the twenty-&s;eventh I informed Congre&s;s of my views and wi&s;hes to attempt &s;omething again&s;t the troops on Staten-I&s;land. I am now to acquaint them, that, by the advice of general Mercer and other officers at Amboy, it will be impracticable to do any thing upon a large &s;cale, for want of craft, and as the enemy have the entire command of the water all round the i&s;land. I have de&s;ired general Mercer to have nine or ten flat-bot|tomed boats built at Newark-bay and Elizabeth-Town, with a de&s;ign principally to keep up the communication acro&s;s Hackin&s;ac and Pa&s;&s;aic rivers, which I deem a matter of great importance, and extremely nece&s;&s;ary to be attend|ed to.</P>
<P>Since I wrote you ye&s;terday, eleven &s;hips more, four brigs, and two &s;loops, have come into the Hook. I have not yet received intelligence what any of the late arrivals are: but I &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hall not long remain in a &s;tate of uncertainty.</P>
<P>Having rea&s;on to believe that lord Howe will readily come into an exchange of &s;uch pri&s;oners as may be more immediately under his command, and that &s;omething will be offered on this &s;ubject within a day or two, or rather come in an&s;wer to the propo&s;itions I have made general Howe. I &s;hould be glad to have Congre&s;s's interpretation of the re&s;olve of the twenty-&s;econd in&s;tant, empowering the commanders to exchange, &amp;c. whether by the word <HI>'&s;ailor,'</HI> they mean &s;ailors generally, as well tho&s;e taken in the ve&s;&s;els of private adventurers by the enemy, as tho&s;e be|longing to the continental crui&s;ers, or ve&s;&s;els in the conti|nent's employ; or whether they only de&s;ign to extend the exchange to the latter,&mdash;tho&s;e in their particular em|ploy.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o ob&s;erve, that, heretofore, &s;ailors belonging to merchant &s;hips that have fallen into our hands, and tho&s;e employed merely as tran&s;ports, have not generally been con&s;idered as pri&s;oners. I &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s whether it may not be now nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s a re&s;olve declaring their &s;entiments on this &s;ubject, and, in general, who are to be treated as pri&s;oners of war, that are taken on board ve&s;&s;els belonging to the &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h crown, &amp;c.

The re&s;ult of their opinion upon the fir&s;t que&s;tion propo&s;|ed, you will be plea&s;ed to tran&s;mit me by the earlie&s;t op|portunity.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed, for the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, a memorial and petition by captain Holdridge, praying to be relieved again&s;t the lo&s;s of money &s;tolen from him,&mdash;not conceiving my&s;elf authori&s;ed to grant his reque&s;t. The certificate which attends it proves him a man of character; and his ca&s;e is hard, on his &s;tate of it. Whether making the lo&s;s good may not open a door to others, and give ri&s;e to applications not &s;o ju&s;t as his may be, I cannot deter|mine. That &s;eems to be the only objection to relieving him.</P>

<P>YOUR favour of the thirtieth ultimo, with its &s;ev|eral inclo&s;ures, I was honoured with by Wedne&s;day's po&s;t.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s having been plea&s;ed to leave with me the direction of colonel Ward's regiment, I have wrote to governor Trumbull, and reque&s;ted him to order their march to this place, being fully &s;atisfied that the enemy mean to make their grand pu&s;h in this quarter, and that the good of the &s;ervice requires every aid here that can be obtained. I have al&s;o wrote to colonel Elmore, and
<PB N="203" REF="029737_0202_0FE24928F6A0CD60">
directed him to repair hither with his regiment. When it comes, I &s;hall fill up commi&s;&s;ions for &s;uch officers as ap|pear with their re&s;pective companies.</P>
<P>Colonel Holman, with a regiment from the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts State, is arrived. Colonel Cary from thence is al&s;o here, waiting the arrival of his regiment which he hourly expects. He adds, when he left New-London he heard that the third regiment from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts was almo&s;t ready, and would &s;oon be in motion.</P>
<P>The enemy's force is daily augmenting and becoming &s;tronger by new arrivals. Ye&s;terday, general Greene re|ports that about forty &s;ail, including tenders, came into the Hook. What they are, or what tho&s;e have brought that have lately got in, I remain uninformed. How|ever, I think it probable they are part of lord Howe's fleet, with the He&s;&s;ian troops:&mdash;it is time to look for them.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honoured with your favour of the thirty-fir&s;t ultimo on Friday, with its &s;everal inclo&s;ures; and return you my thanks for the agreeable intelligence you were plea&s;ed to communicate, of the arrival of one of our &s;hips with &s;uch valuable articles as arms and ammunition; al&s;o of the capture made by a privateer.</P>
<P>The mode for the exchange of pri&s;oners, re&s;olved on by Congre&s;s, is acceded to by general Howe, &s;o far as it comes within his command. A copy of my letter and his an&s;wer upon this &s;ubject I have the honour to inclo&s;e you; to which I beg leave to refer Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from colonel Tupper, who had the general command of the gallies here, will inform Congre&s;s of the engagement between them and the &s;hips of war up the North-river on Saturday evening, and of the damage we &s;u&s;tained. What injury was done to the &s;hips, I cannot a&s;certain. It is &s;aid they were hulled &s;ev|eral
<PB N="204" REF="029737_0203_0FE248D7CA8F1C18">
times by our &s;hot. All accounts agree that our of|ficers and men, during the whole of the affair, behaved with great &s;pirit and bravery. The damage done the gallies &s;hews beyond que&s;tion that they had a warm time of it. The &s;hips &s;till remain up the river; and, before any thing further can be attempted again&s;t them (&s;hould it be thought advi&s;eable) the gallies mu&s;t be repaired.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o tran&s;mitted Congre&s;s a copy of a letter I received by Saturday's po&s;t from governor Cooke, to which I refer them for the intelligence it contains. The &s;eizure of our ve&s;&s;els by the Portugue&s;e is, I fear, an event too true. Their dependence upon the Briti&s;h crown for aid again&s;t the Spaniards mu&s;t force them to comply with every thing required of them. I wi&s;h the Morris may get &s;afe in with her cargo. As to the &s;hips captain Buch|lin &s;aw on the twenty-fifth ultimo, they are probably ar|rived; for ye&s;terday twenty-five &s;ail came into the Hook.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Ward, of the twenty-ninth ultimo, he informs me that two of our armed ve&s;&s;els, the day before, had brought into Marblehead a &s;hip bound from Halifax to Staten-I&s;land. She had in about fifteen hundred and nine pounds' worth of Briti&s;h goods, be&s;ides a good many belonging to tories. A Halifax paper, found on board her, I have inclo&s;ed, as al&s;o an account &s;ent me by Mr. Hazard, tran&s;mitted him by &s;ome of his friends, as given by the tories taken in her. Their intel|ligence, I dare &s;ay, is true re&s;pecting the arrival of part of the He&s;&s;ian troops. General Ward in his letter men|tions, that, the day this prize was taken, captain Burke, in another of our armed ve&s;&s;els, had an engagement with a &s;hip and a &s;chooner which he thought were tran&s;ports, and would have taken them, had it not been for an un|lucky accident in having his quarter-deck blown up. Two of his men were killed, and &s;everal more were wounded.</P>
<P>The hulks and chevaux-de-fri&s;e, that have been pre|paring to ob&s;truct the channel, have got up to the place they are intended for, and will be &s;unk as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible.</P>
<P>I have tran&s;mitted Congre&s;s a general return of the ar|my in and about this place on the third in&s;tant, by which they will perceive the amount of our force.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="029737_0204_0FE2492A7B5CF1F8">
Before I conclude, I would beg leave to remind Con|gre&s;s of the nece&s;&s;ity there is of having &s;ome major-gener|als appointed for this army, the duties of which are great, exten&s;ive, and impo&s;&s;ible to be di&s;charged as they ought and the good of the &s;ervice requires, without a competent number of officers of this rank. I mean to write more fully upon the &s;ubject: and, as things are drawing fa&s;t to an i&s;&s;ue, and it is nece&s;&s;ary to make every proper di&s;|po&s;ition and arrangement that we po&s;&s;ibly can, I pray that this matter may be taken into con&s;ideration, and claim their early attention. I well know what has prevented appointments of this &s;ort for &s;ome time pa&s;t: but the &s;it|uation of our affairs will not ju&s;tify longer delays in this in&s;tance. By the fir&s;t opportunity, I &s;hall take the liber|ty of giving you my &s;entiments more at large upon the propriety and nece&s;&s;ity of the mea&s;ure.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my letter of the fifth which I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you, I begged leave to recal the attention of Congre&s;s to the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity there is for appointing more general officers,&mdash;promi&s;ing at the &s;ame time, by the fir&s;t opportunity, to give my &s;entiments more at large upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Confident I am that the po&s;tponing this mea&s;ure has not proceeded from motives of frugality: otherwi&s;e I &s;hould take the liberty of attempting to prove that we put too much to the hazard by &s;uch a &s;aving. I am but too well appri&s;ed of the difficulties that occur in the choice. They are, I acknowledge, great; but at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be allowed they are of &s;uch a nature as to pre&s;ent them&s;elves whenever the &s;ubject is thought of. Time on the one hand does not remove them; on the other, delay may be pro|ductive of fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P>This army, though far &s;hort as yet of the numbers in|tended by Congre&s;s, is by much too unwieldy for the com|mand of any one man, without &s;everal major-generals to a&s;&s;i&s;t. For it is to be ob&s;erved that a brigadier-general at
<PB N="206" REF="029737_0205_0FE248DEE4AA8D08">
the head of his brigade is no more than a colonel at the head of a regiment, except that he acts upon a larger &s;cale. Officers of more general command are at all times wanted for the good order and government of an army, e&s;pecially when the army is compo&s;ed chiefly of raw troops: but in an action they are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. At pre&s;ent there is but one major-general for this whole department and the flying camp; whereas, at this place alone, le&s;s than three cannot di&s;charge the duties with that regularity they ought to be.</P>
<P>If the&s;e major-generals are appointed, as undoubtedly they will, out of the pre&s;ent brigadiers, you will want for this place three brigadiers at lea&s;t. The northern depart|ment will require one, if not two (as general Thomp&s;on is a pri&s;oner, and the baron Woedtke reported to be dead or in a &s;tate not much better) there being at pre&s;ent only one brigadier-general (Arnold) in all that department. For the ea&s;tern governments there ought to be one, or a major-general, to &s;uperintend the regiments there, and to prevent impo&s;itions that might otherwi&s;e be practi&s;ed. The&s;e make the number wanted to be &s;ix or &s;even: and who are to be appointed, Congre&s;s can be&s;t judge.</P>
<P>To make brigadiers of the olde&s;t colonels would be the lea&s;t exceptionable way: but it is much to be que&s;tioned whether by that mode the able&s;t men would be appointed to office. And I would ob&s;erve, though the rank of the colonels of the ea&s;tern governments was &s;ettled at Cam|bridge la&s;t year, it only re&s;pected them&s;elves and is &s;till open as to officers of other governments. To pick a col|onel here and a colonel there through the army according to the opinion entertained of their abilities, would no doubt be the means of making a better choice, and nominating the fitte&s;t per&s;ons: but then the &s;enior officers would get di&s;gu&s;ted, and, more than probable, with their connexions, quit the &s;ervice. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> might prove fatal at this time. To appoint gentlemen as brigadiers, that had not &s;erved in this army, (in this part of it at lea&s;t) would not wound any one in particular, but hurt the whole equally, and mu&s;t be con&s;idered in a very di&s;couraging light by every officer of merit. View the matter therefore in any point of light you will, there are inconveniences on the one hand, and
<PB N="207" REF="029737_0206_0FE24933CB344D28">
difficulties on the other, which ought to be avoided. Would they be remedied by appointing the olde&s;t colonels from each State?&mdash;If this mode &s;hould be thought ex|pedient, the inclo&s;ed li&s;t gives the names of the colonels, from New-Hamp&s;hire to Penn&s;ylvania inclu&s;ive, &s;peci|fying tho&s;e who rank fir&s;t, as I am told, in the &s;everal colony li&s;ts.</P>
<P>I have tran&s;mitted a copy of a letter from Mr. John Glover, &s;etting forth the nature and grounds of a di&s;pute between him and a Mr. Bradford re&s;pecting their agency. Not conceiving my&s;elf authori&s;ed, nor having the &s;malle&s;t inclination to interefere in any degree in the matter, it is referred to Congre&s;s, who will determine and give direc|tion upon it in &s;uch manner as they &s;hall judge be&s;t. I will only ob&s;erve that Mr. Glover was recommended to me as a proper per&s;on for an agent when we fir&s;t fitted out armed ve&s;&s;els, and was accordingly appointed one; and, &s;o far as I know, di&s;charged his office with fidelity and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>I received ye&s;terday evening a letter from general Schuyler, containing lieutenant M^cMichael's report, who had been &s;ent a &s;cout to O&s;wego. A copy of the report I have inclo&s;ed for the information of Congre&s;s, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t gen|eral Schuyler &s;hould have omitted it in his letter which accompanies this. He was at the German-Flats when he wrote, which was the &s;econd in&s;tant, and the treaty with the Indians not begun; nor had the whole expected then arrived. But of the&s;e things he will have advi&s;ed you more fully, I make no doubt.</P>
<P>The pay-ma&s;ter informs me he received a &s;upply of mon|ey ye&s;terday. It came very &s;ea&s;onably: for the applica|tions and clamours of the troops had become ince&s;&s;ant and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing beyond mea&s;ure. There is now two months' pay due to them.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>By ye&s;terday morning's po&s;t, I was honoured with your favour of the &s;econd in&s;tant, with &s;undry re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s, to which I &s;hall pay &s;trict attention.</P>
<P>As the propo&s;ition for employing the Stockbridge In|dians has been approved, I have wrote to Mr. Edwards, one of the commi&s;&s;ioners, and who lives among them, re|que&s;ting him to engage them, or, &s;uch as are willing, to enter the &s;ervice. I have directed him to indulge them with liberty to join this or the northern army, or both, as their inclination may lead.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h the &s;alutary con&s;equences may re&s;ult from the regulation re&s;pecting &s;eamen taken, that Congre&s;s have in view. From the nature of this kind of people, and the privileges granted on their entering into our &s;ervice, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e many of them will do it. We want them much.</P>
<P>I ye&s;terday tran&s;mitted the intelligence I received from the de&s;erters from the Solebay man-of-war. The inclo&s;|ed copy of a letter by la&s;t night's po&s;t, from the honoura|ble Mr. Bowdoin, with the information of a captain Ken|nedy lately taken, corroborate their accounts re&s;pecting the He&s;&s;ian troops. Indeed his report makes the fleet and armament, to be employed again&s;t us, greater than what we have heard they would be. However there re|mains no doubt of their being both large and formidable, and &s;uch as will require our mo&s;t vigorous exertions to oppo&s;e them. Per&s;uaded of this, and knowing how much inferior our numbers are and will be to theirs when the whole of their troops arrive,&mdash;of the important con&s;e|quences that may and will flow from the appeal that will &s;oon be made,&mdash;I have wrote to Connecticut and New-Jer&s;ey, for all the &s;uccour they can afford, and al&s;o to the convention of this State. What I may receive, and in what time, the event mu&s;t determine. But I would fain hope, the &s;ituation and the exigency of our affairs will call forth the mo&s;t &s;trenuous efforts and early a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e who are friends to the cau&s;e. I confe&s;s there is but too much occa&s;ion for their exertions. I confidently tru&s;t they will not be withheld.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="029737_0209_0FE248E2F36EEA78">
I have inclo&s;ed a copy of a letter from Mr. Bowdoin re&s;pecting the ea&s;tern Indians. Congre&s;s will thereby perceive that they profe&s;s them&s;elves to be well attached to our intere&s;t,&mdash;and the &s;ummary of the mea&s;ures taken to engage them in our &s;ervice. I have the treaty at large between the honourable council of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, on behalf of the United States, with the delegates of the Saint John's and Mickmac tribes. The probability of a copy's being &s;ent already, and its great length, prevent one coming herewith. If Congre&s;s have not had it for|warded to them, I will &s;end a copy by the fir&s;t oppor|tunity after notice that it has not been received.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 9.&mdash;By a report received from general Greene la&s;t night, at &s;un&s;et and a little after, about a hundred boats were &s;een bringing troops from Staten-I&s;land to the &s;hips, three of which had fallen down towards the narrows, having taken in &s;oldiers from thirty of the boats. He adds, that, by the be&s;t ob&s;ervations of &s;everal officers, there appeared to be a general embarkation.</P>
<P>I have wrote to general Mercer for two thou&s;and men from the flying camp. Colonel Smallwood's battalion, as part of them, I expect this forenoon: but where the re&s;t are to come from, I know not, as, by the general's la&s;t re|turn, not more than three or four hundred of the new levies had got in.</P>
<P>In my letter of the fifth I inclo&s;ed a general return of the army under my immediate command; but I imagine the following &s;tate will give Congre&s;s a more perfect idea, though not a more agreeable one, of our &s;ituation. For the &s;everal po&s;ts on New-York, Long and Governor's i&s;lands, and Paulus-Hook, we have, fit for duty, ten thou|&s;and five hundred and fourteen,&mdash;&s;ick pre&s;ent, three thou|&s;and and thirty-nine,&mdash;&s;ick ab&s;ent, &s;ix hundred and twen|ty-nine,&mdash;on command, two thou&s;and nine hundred and forty &s;ix,&mdash;on furlough, ninety-&s;even,&mdash;total, &s;eventeen thou&s;and two hundred and twenty-five. In addition to the&s;e, we are only certain of colonel Smallwood's battalion in ca&s;e of an immediate attack. Our po&s;ts too are much divided, having waters between many of them, and &s;ome di&s;tant from others fifteen miles. The&s;e circum&s;tances, &s;ufficiently di&s;tre&s;&s;ing of them&s;elves, are much aggravated
<PB N="211" REF="029737_0210_0FE24936CFB5F518">
by the &s;ickne&s;s that prevails through the army. Every day more or le&s;s are taken down; &s;o that the proportion of men that may come in cannot be con&s;idered as a real and &s;erviceable augmentation on the whole.</P>
<P>The&s;e things are melancholy; but they are neverthe|le&s;s true. I hope for better. Under every di&s;advantage, my utmo&s;t exertions &s;hall be employed to bring about the great end we have in view: and, &s;o far as I can judge from the profe&s;&s;ions and apparent di&s;po&s;ition of my troops, I &s;hall have their &s;upport. The &s;uperiority of the enemy and the expected attack do not &s;eem to have depre&s;&s;ed their &s;pirits. The&s;e con&s;iderations lead me to think, that, though the appeal may not terminate &s;o happily in our favour as I could wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h, yet they will not &s;ucceed in their views without con&s;iderable lo&s;s. Any advantage they may get, I tru&s;t, will co&s;t them dear.</P>
<P><HI>Eight o'clock, P. M.</HI></P>
<P>By the reverend Mr. Madi&s;on and a Mr. John&s;on, two gentlemen of Virginia, who came from Staten-I&s;land ye&s;|terday, where they arrived the day before in the packet with colonel Guy John&s;on, I am informed that nothing material had taken place in England when they left it:&mdash;that there had been a change in the French mini&s;try, which, many people thought, foreboded a war;&mdash;that it &s;eemed to be believed by many that Congre&s;s would attempt to buy off the foreign troops, and that it might be effect|ed without great difficulty. Their accounts from Staten-I&s;land nearly corre&s;pond with what we had before: they &s;ay that every preparation is making for an attack;&mdash;that the force now upon the i&s;land is about fifteen thou&s;and;&mdash;that they appear very impatient for the arrival of the for|eign troops, but a very &s;mall part having got in. Wheth|er they would attempt any thing before they come, they are uncertain: but they are &s;ure they will as &s;oon as they arrive, if not before. They &s;ay, from what they could collect from the conver&s;ation of officers, &amp;c. they mean to hem us in by getting above us and cutting off all commu|nication with the country.</P>
<P>That this is their plan, &s;eems to be corroborated and confirmed by the circum&s;tance of &s;ome &s;hips of war going out at different times within a few days pa&s;t, and other

<P>The convention of this State have been exerting them|&s;elves to call forth a portion of their militia to an encamp|ment forming above King&s;bridge, to remain in &s;ervice for the &s;pace of one month after their arrival there; and al&s;o half of tho&s;e in King and Queen's counties, to reinforce the troops on Long-I&s;land till the fir&s;t of September, un|le&s;s &s;ooner di&s;charged. General Morris too is to take po&s;t with his brigade on the Sound and Hud&s;on's-river for ten days, to annoy the enemy in ca&s;e they attempt to land; and others of their militia are directed to be in readine&s;s, in ca&s;e their aid &s;hould be required. Upon the whole, from the information I have from the convention, the militia ordered are now in motion, or will be in a lit|tle

time, and will amount to about three thou&s;and or more. From Connecticut, I am not certain what &s;uccours are coming. By one or two gentlemen who have come from thence, I am told &s;ome of the militia were a&s;&s;embling, and, from the intelligence they had, would march this week.</P>
<P>By a letter from governor Trumbull, of the fifth, I am advi&s;ed that the troops from that State, de&s;tined for the northern army, had marched for Skene&s;borough. Gener|al Ward too, by a letter of the fourth, informs me that the two regiments would march from Bo&s;ton la&s;t week, having been clean&s;ed and generally recovered from the &s;mall-pox. I have al&s;o countermanded my orders to col|onel Elmore, and directed him to join the northern army, having heard, after my orders to Connecticut for his march|ing hither, that he and mo&s;t of his regiment were at Alba|ny or within its vicinity. General Ward mentions that the council of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts State will have in from two to three thou&s;and of their militia to defend their lines and different po&s;ts, in lieu of the regiments ordered from thence agreeable to the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed copy of a re&s;olve of this State, pa&s;&s;ed the tenth in&s;tant, will di&s;cover the apprehen&s;ion they are un|der of the defection of the inhabitants of King's county from the common cau&s;e, and of the mea&s;ures they have taken thereupon. I have directed general Greene to give the committee &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as he can, and they may re|quire, in the execution of their commi&s;&s;ion; though at the &s;ame time I wi&s;h the information the convention have re|ceived upon the &s;ubject may prove groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to mention to Congre&s;s, that, in a letter I received from general Lee, he mentions the valua|ble con&s;equences that would re&s;ult from a number of cav|alry being employed in the &s;outhern department.

<P>As we are in extreme want of tents and covering for this army,&mdash;a great part of tho&s;e at the out-po&s;ts having nothing to &s;helter them, nor hou&s;es to go into,&mdash;I &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s whether it may not be prudent to remand tho&s;e that were lately &s;ent to Bo&s;ton, where there are no troops at pre&s;ent; and, if there were, the nece&s;&s;ity for them would not be great, as the town, and barracks at &s;everal of the po&s;ts, would be &s;ufficient to receive them.</P>

<P>THE circum&s;tances of the two armies having under|gone no material alteration &s;ince I had the honour of writ|ing to you la&s;t, I have nothing particular or important to communicate re&s;pecting them.</P>
<P>In my letter of ye&s;terday I forgot to mention the arrival of lord Dunmore here. By the examination of a captain Hunter (who e&s;caped from the enemy, and came to Am|boy on the fourteenth) tran&s;mitted me by general Rober|deau, I am certainly informed his lord&s;hip arrived on the thirteenth. The examination does not &s;ay any thing about the &s;hips he brought with him; it only extends to his force, which it mentions to be weak.</P>
<P>I before now expected the enemy would have made their attack; nor can I account for their deferring it, unle&s;s the intelligence, given by captain Hunter and another per|&s;on who e&s;caped about the &s;ame time, is the cau&s;e, to wit, that they are waiting the arrival of another divi&s;ion of the He&s;&s;ian troops, which (they &s;ay) is &s;till out.

<P>I HAVE been honoured with your favour of the &s;ixteenth with the inclo&s;ure, and am &s;orry it is not in my power to tran&s;mit Congre&s;s a copy of the treaty as they require, having &s;ent it away with the other papers that were in my hands.</P>
<P>The re&s;olution they have entered into re&s;pecting the for|eign troops, I am per&s;uaded, would produce &s;alutary effects if it could be properly circulated among them. I fear it will be a matter of difficulty. However, I will take every mea&s;ure that &s;hall appear probable to facilitate the end.</P>
<P>I have the honour to inclo&s;e you, for the peru&s;al and con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, &s;undry papers marked N^o 1 to N^o 7, inclu&s;ive; the whole of which, except N^o 2 and 7, (my an&s;wers to lord Drummond and general Howe) I received ye&s;terday evening by a flag, and to which I beg leave to refer Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>I am exceedingly at a lo&s;s to know the motives and cau&s;es inducing a proceeding of &s;uch a nature at this time, and why lord Howe has not attempted &s;ome plan of nego|ciation before, as he &s;eems &s;o de&s;irous of it. If I may be allowed to conjecture and gue&s;s at the cau&s;e, it may be that part of the He&s;&s;ians have not arrived, as mentioned in the examination tran&s;mitted ye&s;terday,&mdash;or that general Burgoyne has not made &s;uch progre&s;s as was expected, to form a junction of their two armies,&mdash;or, what I think equally probable, they mean to procra&s;tinate their opera|tions for &s;ome time, tru&s;ting that the militias which have come to our &s;uccour will &s;oon become tired and return home, as is but too u&s;ual with them. Congre&s;s will make their ob&s;ervations upon the&s;e &s;everal matters, and favour me with the re&s;ult as &s;oon as they have done. They will ob&s;erve my an&s;wer to lord Drummond, who (I am pretty confident) has not attended to the terms of his parole, but
<PB N="220" REF="029737_0219_0FE248F269FDCD38">
has violated it in &s;everal in&s;tances. It is with the re&s;t of the papers; but, if my memory &s;erves me, he was not to hold any corre&s;pondence directly or indirectly with tho&s;e in arms again&s;t us, or to go into any port or harbour in America, where the enemy them&s;elves were or had a fleet, or to go on board their &s;hips.</P>
<P>The treaty with the Indians is in the box which lieuten|ant-colonel Reed, I pre&s;ume, has delivered before this. If Congre&s;s are de&s;irous of &s;eeing it, they will be plea&s;ed to have the box opened. It contains a variety of papers, and all the affairs of the army, from my fir&s;t going to Cam|bridge, till it was &s;ent away.</P>
<P>This morning the Phoenix and Ro&s;e men-of-war, with two tenders, availing them&s;elves of a favourable and bri&s;k wind, came down the river, and have joined the fleet. Our &s;everal batteries fired at them in their pa&s;&s;age, but without any good effect that I could perceive.</P>

<P>I wrote &s;ome days ago to general Schuyler to propo&s;e to generals Carleton and Burgoyne an exchange of pri&s;on|ers in con&s;equence of a former re&s;olve of Congre&s;s author+i&s;ing their commanders in each department to negociate one.

<P>I am al&s;o advi&s;ed by the examination of a captain Button (ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el that had been taken) tran&s;mitted me by general Mercer, that the general report among the ene|my's troops, when he came off, was, that they were to attack Long-I&s;land, and to &s;ecure our works there if po&s;&s;i|ble, at the &s;ame time that another part of their army was to land above this city. This information is corroborated by many other accounts, and is probably true: nor will it be po&s;&s;ible to prevent them landing on the i&s;land, as its great extent affords a variety of places favourable for that purpo&s;e, and the whole of our works on it are at the end

<P>I BEG leave to inform Congre&s;s, that, ye&s;terday morning and in the cour&s;e of the preceding night, a con|&s;iderable body of the enemy, amounting by report to eight or nine thou&s;and, and the&s;e all Briti&s;h, landed from the tran&s;port-&s;hips mentioned in my la&s;t, at Grave&s;end-bay on Long-I&s;land, and have approached within three miles of our lines, having marched acro&s;s the low cleared grounds near the woods at Flat-bu&s;h, where they are halt|ed, from my la&s;t intelligence.</P>
<P>I have detached from hence &s;ix battalions as a rein|forcement to our troops there, which are all that I can &s;pare at this time, not knowing but the fleet may move up with the remainder of their army, and make an attack here, on the next flood-tide. If they do not, I &s;hall &s;end a further reinforcement, &s;hould it be nece&s;&s;ary; and have ordered five battalions more to be in readine&s;s for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but a little time will produce &s;ome im|portant events. I hope they will be happy. The rein|forcement detached ye&s;terday went off in high &s;pirits; and I have the plea&s;ure to inform you that the whole of the army, that are effective and capable of duty, di&s;cover the &s;ame, and great cheerfulne&s;s.

<P>THE irregularity of the po&s;t prevents your receiv|ing the early and con&s;tant intelligence it is my wi&s;h to communicate. This is the third letter which you will probably receive from me by the &s;ame po&s;t. The fir&s;t was of little or no con&s;equence: but that of ye&s;terday gave you the be&s;t information I had been able to obtain of the enemy's landing and movements upon Long-I&s;land. Having occa&s;ion to go over thither ye&s;terday, I &s;ent my letter to the po&s;t-office at the u&s;ual hour, being informed that the rider was expected every moment, and would go out again directly: but in the evening when I &s;ent to inquire, none had come in.</P>
<P>I now inclo&s;e you a report made to me by general Sullivan after I left Long-I&s;land ye&s;terday. I do not conceive that the enemy's whole force was in motion, but a detached party rather. I have &s;ent over four more regi|ments, with boats, to be ready either to reinforce the troops under general Sullivan, or to return to this place, if the remainder of the fleet at the watering-place &s;hould pu&s;h up to the city; which hitherto (I mean, &s;ince the landing upon Long-I&s;land) they have not had in their power to do, on account of the wind which has either been a-head or too &s;mall when the tide has &s;erved.

my an&s;wer to lord Drummond has met the approbation of Congre&s;s. Whatever his views were, mo&s;t certainly his conduct re&s;pecting his parole is highly reprehen&s;ible.</P>
<P>Since my letter of the twenty-fourth, almo&s;t the whole of the enemy's fleet have fallen down to the Narrows; and, from this circum&s;tance, and the &s;triking of their tents at their &s;everal encampments on Staten-I&s;land from time to time previous to the departure of the &s;hips from thence, we are led to think they mean to land the main body of their army on Long-I&s;land, and to make their grand pu&s;h there. I have ordered over con&s;iderable reinforcements to our troops there, and &s;hall continue to &s;end more as circum&s;tances may require. There has been a little &s;kir|mi&s;hing and irregular firing kept up between their and our advanced guards, in which colonel Martin of the Jer&s;ey levies has received a wound in his brea&s;t, which, it is ap|prehended, will prove mortal; a private has had his leg broke by a cannon-ball, and another has received a &s;hot in the groin from their mu&s;ketry. This is all the damage they have yet done us:&mdash;what they have &s;u&s;tained, is not known.</P>
<P>The &s;hifting and changing the regiments have undergone of late has prevented their making proper returns, and of cour&s;e put it out of my power to tran&s;mit a general one of the army. However, I believe our &s;trength is much the &s;ame as it was when the la&s;t was made, with the ad|dition, of nine militia regiments come from the State of Connecticut, averaging about three hundred and fifty men each. The&s;e are nine of the fourteen regiments mention|ed in my letter of the nineteenth. Our people &s;till con|tinue to be very &s;ickly.</P>
<P>The papers de&s;igned for the foreign troops have been put into &s;everal channels, in order that they might be conveyed to them; and, from the information I had ye&s;|terday, I have rea&s;on to believe many have fallen into their hands.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a copy of lord Drummond's &s;econd let|ter (in an&s;wer to mine) which I received &s;ince I tran&s;|mitted his fir&s;t, and which I have thought nece&s;&s;ary to lay before Congre&s;s, that they may po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole of the

<P>I THIS minute returned from our lines on Long-I&s;land, where I left his excellency the General. From him I have it in command to inform Congre&s;s, that ye&s;|terday he went there, and continued till evening, when, from the enemy's having landed a con&s;iderable part of their forces,&mdash;and many of their movements,&mdash;there was rea&s;on to apprehend they would make in a little time a general attack. As they would have a wood to pa&s;s through before they could approach the lines, it was thought expedient to place a number of men there on the different roads leading from where they were &s;tationed, in order to hara&s;s and annoy them in their march. This being done, early this morning a &s;mart engagement en&s;ued between the enemy and our detachments, which, being unequal to the force they had to contend with, have &s;u&s;|tained a pretty con&s;iderable lo&s;s: at lea&s;t many of our men are mi&s;&s;ing. Among tho&s;e that have not returned, are generals Sullivan and lord Stirling. The enemy's lo&s;s is not known certainly: but we are told by &s;uch of our troops as were in the engagement and have come in, that they had many killed and wounded. Our party brought off a lieutenant, &s;erjeant, and coporal, with twen|ty privates, pri&s;oners.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="029737_0227_0FE249011AA23CC0">
While the&s;e detachments were engaged, a column of the enemy de&s;cended from the woods, and marched to|wards the centre of our lines with a de&s;ign to make an impre&s;&s;ion, but were repul&s;ed. This evening they ap|peared very numerous about the &s;kirts of the woods, where they have pitched &s;everal tents: and his excellency in|clines to think they mean to attack and force us from our lines by way of regular approaches, rather than in any other manner.</P>
<P>To-day, five &s;hips of the line came up towards the town, where they &s;eemed de&s;irous of getting, as they turn|ed a long time again&s;t an unfavourable wind: and on my return this evening, I found a de&s;erter from the twenty-third regiment, who informed me that they de&s;ign, as &s;oon as the wind will permit them to come up, to give us a &s;evere cannonade, and to &s;ilence our batteries, if po&s;&s;ible.

<P>I WAS la&s;t night honoured with your favour of the twenty-&s;eventh, accompanied by &s;undry re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s. Tho&s;e re&s;pecting the officers, &amp;c. that may be wounded in the &s;ervice of the States, are founded much in ju&s;tice, and (I &s;hould hope) may be productive of ma|ny &s;alutary con&s;equences. As to the encouragement to the He&s;&s;ian officers, I wi&s;h it may have the de&s;ired effect. Perhaps it might have been better had the offer been &s;ooner made.</P>
<P>Before this, you will probably have received a letter from Mr. Harri&s;on, of the twenty-&s;eventh, advi&s;ing of the engagement between a detachment of our men and the enemy on that day. I am &s;orry to inform Congre&s;s that I have not yet heard either of general Sullivan or lord Stirling, who (they would ob&s;erve) were among the mi&s;&s;ing after the engagement: nor can I a&s;certain our lo&s;s. I am hopeful, part of our men will yet get in: &s;everal did ye&s;terday morning. That of the enemy is al&s;o un|certain:

the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ounts are various. I incline to think they &s;uffered a good deal. Some de&s;erters &s;ay five hun|dred were killed and wounded.</P>
<P>There was &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hing, the greate&s;t part of ye&s;|terday, between parties from the enemy and our people: in the evening it was pretty &s;mart. The event I have not yet learned.</P>

<P>INCLINATION as well as duty would have in|duced me to give Congre&s;s the earlie&s;t information of my removal and that of the troops, from Long-I&s;land and its dependencies, to this city, the night before la&s;t: but the extreme fatigue which my&s;elf and family have undergone, as much from the weather &s;ince as the engagement on the twenty-&s;eventh, rendered me and them entirely unfit to take pen in hand. Since Monday, &s;carce any of us have been out of the lines till our pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s the Ea&s;t-river was effected ye&s;terday morning; and, for forty-eight hours preceding that, I had hardly been off my hor&s;e, and never clo&s;ed my eyes; &s;o that I was quite unfit to write or dic|tate till this morning.</P>
<P>Our retreat was made without any lo&s;s of men or am|munition, and in better order than I expected from troops in the &s;ituation ours were. We brought off all our cannon and &s;tores, except a few heavy pieces, which, in the condition the earth was by a long-continued rain, we
<PB N="230" REF="029737_0229_0FE249092AF84650">
found, upon trial, impracticable. The wheels of the car|riages &s;inking up to the hobs rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for our whole force to drag them. We left but little provi&s;ions on the i&s;land, except &s;ome cattle which had been driven within our lines, and which, after many attempts to force acro&s;s the water, we found impo&s;&s;ible to effect, circum|&s;tanced as we were.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a copy of the council of war held pre|vious to the retreat, to which I beg leave to refer Congre&s;s for the rea&s;ons, or many of them, that led to the adoption of that mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday evening and la&s;t night, a party of our men were employed in bringing our &s;tores, cannon, tents, &amp;c. from Governor's-I&s;land, which they nearly completed. Some of the heavy cannon remain there &s;till, but (I ex|pect) will be got away to-day.</P>
<P>In the engagement on the twenty-&s;eventh, generals Sullivan and Stirling were made pri&s;oners. The former has been permitted, on his parole, to return for a little time. From my lord Stirling I had a letter by general Sullivan (a copy of which I have the honour to tran&s;mit) that contains his information of the engagement with his brigade. It is not &s;o full and certain as I could wi&s;h:&mdash;he was hurried mo&s;t probably, as his letter was unfini&s;hed:&mdash;nor have I been yet able to obtain an exact account of our lo&s;s;&mdash;we &s;uppo&s;e it from &s;even hundred to a thou&s;and killed and taken.</P>
<P>General Sullivan &s;ays lord Howe is extremely de&s;irous of &s;eeing &s;ome of the members of Congre&s;s; for which purpo&s;e he was allowed to come out, and to communicate to them what has pa&s;&s;ed between him and his lord&s;hip. I have con&s;ented to his going to Philadelphia, as I do not mean, or conceive it right, to withhold, or prevent him from giving, &s;uch information as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in this in|&s;tance.</P>
<P>I am much hurried and engaged in arranging and mak|ing new di&s;po&s;itions of our forces; the movements of the enemy requiring them to be immediately had;&mdash;and there|fore have only time to add, that I am, with my be&s;t re|gards to Congre&s;s, their and your mo&s;t obedient, &amp;c.</P>

<P>AS my intelligence of late has been rather unfavour|able, and would be received with anxiety and concern, pe|culiarly happy &s;hould I e&s;teem my&s;elf, were it in my pow|er at this time to tran&s;mit &s;uch information to Congre&s;s, as would be more plea&s;ing and agreeable to their wi&s;hes:&mdash;but, unfortunately for me,&mdash;unfortunately for them,&mdash;it is not.</P>
<P>Our &s;ituation is truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. The check our de|tachment &s;u&s;tained on the twenty-&s;eventh ultimo has di&s;|pirited too great a proportion of our troops, and filled their minds with apprehen&s;ion and de&s;pair. The militia, in&s;tead of calling forth their utmo&s;t efforts to a brave and manly oppo&s;ition in order to repair our lo&s;&s;es, are di&s;mayed, in|tractable, and impatient to return. Great numbers of them have gone off,&mdash;in &s;ome in&s;tances, almo&s;t by whole regiments, by half ones, and by companies at a time. This circum&s;tance, of it&s;elf, independent of others, when fronted by a well-appointed enemy &s;uperior in number to our whole collected force, would be &s;ufficiently di&s;agreea|ble:&mdash;but, when their example has infected another part of the army,&mdash;when their want of di&s;cipline, and refu&s;al of almo&s;t every kind of re&s;traint and government, have pro|duced a like conduct but too common to the whole, and an entire di&s;regard of that order and &s;ubordination nece&s;&s;a|ry to the well doing of an army, and which had been in|culcated before, as well as the nature of our military e&s;|tabli&s;hment would admit of,&mdash;our condition is &s;till more alarming: and with the deepe&s;t concern I am obliged to confe&s;s my want of confidence in the generality of the troops.</P>
<P>All the&s;e circum&s;tances fully confirm the opinion I ev|er entertained, and which I more than once in my letters took the liberty of mentioning to Congre&s;s, that no depend|ence could be put in a militia, or other troops than tho&s;e enli&s;ted and embodied for a longer period than our regula|tions heretofore have pre&s;cribed. I am per&s;uaded, and as fully convinced as I am of any one fact that has happened, that our liberties mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be greatly hazarded if not entirely lo&s;t, if their defence is left to any but a per|manent
<PB N="232" REF="029737_0231_0FE2490BDBE2CF28">
&s;tanding army,&mdash;I mean, one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">xi&s;t during the war. Nor would the expen&s;e, incident to the &s;upport of &s;uch a body of troops as would be competent to almo&s;t every exigency, far exceed that which is daily incurred by calling in &s;uccour, and new enli&s;tments, which, when ef|fected, are not attended with any good con&s;equences. Men who have been free, and &s;ubject to no control, cannot be reduced to order in an in&s;tant; and the privileges and exemptions they claim and will have, influence the con|duct of others; and the aid derived from them is nearly counterbalanced by the di&s;order, irregularity, and confu&s;ion they occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I cannot find that the bounty of ten dollars is likely to produce the de&s;ired effect. When men can get double that &s;um to engage for a month or two in the militia, and that militia frequently called out, it is hardly to be expect|ed. The addition of land might have a con&s;iderable in|fluence on a permanent enli&s;tment.</P>
<P>Our number of men at pre&s;ent fit for duty is under twenty thou&s;and; they were &s;o by the la&s;t returns and be&s;t accounts I could get after the engagement on Long-I&s;land; &s;ince which, numbers have de&s;erted. I have or|dered general Mercer to &s;end the men intended for the flying camp to this place, about a thou&s;and in number, and to try with the militia, if practicable, to make a diver&s;ion upon Staten-I&s;land.</P>
<P>Till of late, I had no doubt in my own mind, of de|fending this place: nor &s;hould I have yet, if the men would do their duty: but this I de&s;pair of. It is painful, and ex|tremely grating to me, to give &s;uch unfavourable accounts: but it would be criminal to conceal the truth at &s;o critical a juncture. Every power I po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;hall be exerted to &s;erve the cau&s;e; and my fir&s;t wi&s;h is, that, whatever may be the event, the Congre&s;s will do me the ju&s;tice to think &s;o.</P>
<P>If we &s;hould be obliged to abandon the town, ought it to &s;tand as winter quarters for the enemy? They would derive great conveniences from it on the one hand; and much property would be de&s;troyed on the other. It is an important que&s;tion, but will admit of but little time for de|liberation.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you on the &s;econd, our affairs have not undergone a change for the better, nor a&s;&s;umed a more agreeable a&s;pect than what they then wore. The militia, under various pretences, of &s;ick|ne&s;s, &amp;c. are daily dimini&s;hing; and in a little time, I am per&s;uaded, their number will be very incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>On Monday night a forty-gun &s;hip pa&s;&s;ed up the Sound between Governor's and Long-I&s;land, and anchored in Turtle-bay. In her pa&s;&s;age &s;he received a di&s;charge of cannon from our batteries, but without any damage; and, having a favourable wind and tide, &s;oon got out of their reach. Ye&s;terday morning I di&s;patched major Crane of the artillery, with two twelve-pounders and a howitzer, to annoy her; who, hulling her &s;everal times, forced her from that &s;tation, and to take &s;helter behind an i&s;land, where &s;he &s;till continues. There are &s;everal other &s;hips of war in the Sound, with a good many tran&s;ports or &s;tore-&s;hips which came round Long-I&s;land, &s;o that that communication is entirely cut off. The admiral, with the main body of the fleet, is clo&s;e in with Governor's-I&s;land.</P>
<P>Judging it expedient to guard again&s;t every contingency as far as our peculiar &s;ituation will admit, and that we may have re&s;ources left if obliged to abandon this place, I have &s;ent away and am removing above King&s;bridge all our &s;tores that are unnece&s;&s;ary, and that will not be immedi|ately wanted.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed &s;everal original letters from &s;ome of our officers pri&s;oners at Quebec, which fell into general Gates's hands, and were tran&s;mitted by him to general Schuyler who &s;ent them to me. General Gates adds, that the per|&s;ons who brought them &s;aid general Burgoyne had &s;ent me&s;&s;ages to the inhabitants upon the lakes; inviting their
<PB N="234" REF="029737_0233_0FE2490D5F2D6A30">
continuance on their farms, and a&s;&s;uring them that they &s;hould remain in &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>The po&s;t-ma&s;ter having removed his office from the city to Dobbs's-ferry, as it is &s;aid, makes it extremely incon|venient, and will be the means of my not giving &s;uch con|&s;tant and regular intelligence as I could wi&s;h. Cannot &s;ome mode be devi&s;ed, by which we may have a pretty con&s;tant and certain intercour&s;e and communication kept up? It is an intere&s;ting matter, and of great importance; and, as &s;uch, I am per&s;uaded, will meet with due attention from Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>I have tran&s;mitted the copy of general Gates's letter as &s;ent me by general Schuyler, from which Congre&s;s will di&s;cover all the information I have re&s;pecting general Bur|goyne's me&s;&s;age, and my late&s;t intelligence from Ticonde|roga, with the returns of the army there. Tho&s;e of the army here it is, impo&s;&s;ible to obtain, till the hurry and bu&s;|tle we are now in are a little over.</P>

<P>P. S. Congre&s;s will perceive, by general Gates's letter, his want of mu&s;ket-cartridge-paper. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upply him from hence. They will therefore be plea&s;ed to order what he wants (if it can be procured) to be im|mediately &s;ent him from Philadelphia.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS la&s;t night honoured with your favour of the third, with &s;undry re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s; and perceiving it to be their opinion and determination that no damage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hall be done the city in ca&s;e we are obliged to abandon it, I &s;hall take every mea&s;ure in my power to prevent it.</P>
<P>Since my letter of the fourth, nothing very material has occurred, unle&s;s it is that the fleet &s;eem to be drawing more together, and all getting clo&s;e in with Governor's-I&s;land. Their de&s;igns we cannot learn; nor have we been able to procure the lea&s;t information of late, of any of their plans or intended operations.</P>
<P>As the enemy's movements are very different from what we expected,&mdash;and, from their large encampments a
<PB N="235" REF="029737_0234_0FE2495F09E69390">
con&s;iderable di&s;tance up the Sound, there is rea&s;on to be|lieve they intend to make a landing above or below King&s;|bridge, and thereby to hem in our army, and cut off the communication with the country,&mdash;I mean to call a coun|cil of general officers to-day or to-morrow, and endeavour to dige&s;t and fix upon &s;ome regular and certain &s;y&s;tem of conduct to be pur&s;ued in order to battle their efforts and counteract their &s;chemes; and al&s;o to determine of the ex|pediency of evacuating or attempting to maintain the city and the &s;everal po&s;ts on this i&s;land. The re&s;ult of their opinion and deliberations I &s;hall advi&s;e Congre&s;s of by the earlie&s;t opportunity, which will be by expre&s;s, having it not in my power to communicate any intelligence by po&s;t, as the office is removed to &s;o great a di&s;tance, and entirely out of the way.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a li&s;t of the officers who are pri&s;oners, and from whom letters have been received by a flag. We know there are others not included in the li&s;t.</P>
<P>General Sullivan having informed me that general Howe was willing that an exchange of him for general Pre&s;cot &s;hould take place, it will be proper to &s;end general Pre&s;cot immediately, that it may be effected.</P>
<P>As the milltia regiments in all probability will be impa|tient to return, and become pre&s;&s;ing for their pay, I &s;hall be glad of the direction of Congre&s;s, whether they are to receive it here or from the conventions or a&s;&s;emblies of the re&s;pective States to which they belong. On the one hand, the &s;ettlement of their ab&s;tracts will be attended with trou|ble and difficulty: on the other, they will go away much better &s;atisfied, and be more ready to give their aid in future, if they are paid before their departure.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I mu&s;t take the liberty of mentioning to Congre&s;s the great di&s;tre&s;s we are in for want of money. Two months' pay (and more to &s;ome battalions) is now due to the troops here, without any thing in the military che&s;t to &s;atisfy it. This occa&s;ions much di&s;&s;atisfaction, and almo&s;t a general unea&s;ine&s;s. Not a day pa&s;&s;es without complaints and the mo&s;t importunate and urgent demands on this head. As it may injure the &s;ervice greatly, and the want of a regular &s;upply of ca&s;h produce con&s;equences of the mo&s;t fatal tendency, I entreat the attention of Congre&s;s

to this &s;ubject, and that we may be provided as &s;oon as can be with a &s;um equal to every pre&s;ent claim.</P>
<P>I have wrote to general Howe, propo&s;ing an exchange of general M^cDonald for lord Stirling, and &s;hall be ex|tremely happy to obtain it, as well as that of general Sul|livan for general Pre&s;cot, being greatly in want of them, and under the nece&s;&s;ity of appointing, pro tempore, &s;ome of the colonels to command brigades.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you on the &s;ixth in&s;tant, I have called a council of the general officers, in order to take a full and comprehen&s;ive view of our &s;itua|tion, and thereupon form &s;uch a plan of future defence as may be immediately pur&s;ued, and &s;ubject to no other alter|ation
<PB N="237" REF="029737_0236_0FE249608E1DB948">
than a change of operations on the enemy's &s;ide may occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Before the landing of the enemy on Long-I&s;land, the point of attack could not be known, or any &s;atisfactory judgment formed of their intentions. It might be on Long-I&s;land, or Bergen, or directly on the city. This made it nece&s;&s;ary to be prepared for each, and has occa|&s;ioned an expen&s;e of labour which now &s;eems u&s;ele&s;s, and is regretted by tho&s;e who form a judgment from after-knowledge. But I tru&s;t, men of di&s;cernment will think differently, and &s;ee that by &s;uch works and preparations we have not only delayed the operations of the campaign till it is too late to effect any capital incur&s;ion into the country, but have drawn the enemy's forces to one point and obliged them to [<HI>di&s;clo&s;e</HI>] their plan, &s;o as to enable us to form our defence on &s;ome certainty.</P>
<P>It is now extremely obvious from all intelligence,&mdash;from their movements, and every other circum&s;tance,&mdash;that having landed their whole army on Long-I&s;land (except about four thou&s;and on Staten-I&s;land) they mean to inclo&s;e us on the i&s;land of New-York, by taking po&s;t in our rear while the &s;hipping effectually &s;ecure the front; and thus, either by cutting off our communication with the country, oblige us to fight them on their own terms, or &s;urrender at di&s;cretion,&mdash;or by a brilliant &s;troke en|deavour to cut this army in pieces, and &s;ecure the col|lection of arms and &s;tores, which they well know we &s;hall not be able &s;oon to replace.</P>
<P>Having therefore their &s;y&s;tem unfolded to us, it became an important con&s;ideration how it could be mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully oppo&s;ed. On every &s;ide there is a choice of diffi|culties; and every mea&s;ure on our part (however painful the reflection is from experience) to be formed with &s;ome apprehen&s;ion that all our troops will not do their duty. In deliberating on this great que&s;tion, it was impo&s;&s;ible to forget, that hi&s;tory, our own experience, the advice of our able&s;t friends in Europe, the fears of the enemy, and even the declarations of Congre&s;s, demon&s;trate, that on our &s;ide the war &s;hould be defen&s;ive&mdash;(it has ever been called a war of po&s;ts)&mdash;that we &s;hould on all occa&s;ions avoid a general action, nor put any thing to the ri&s;k, un|le&s;s
<PB N="238" REF="029737_0237_0FE24916E3718838">
compelled by a nece&s;&s;ity into which we ought never to be drawn.</P>
<P>The arguments on which &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem was founded were deemed unan&s;werable; and experience has given her &s;anction. With the&s;e views, and being fully per&s;uaded that it would be pre&s;umption to draw out our young troops into open ground again&s;t their &s;uperiors both in number and di&s;cipline, I have never &s;pared the &s;pade and pickaxe. I confe&s;s I have not found that readine&s;s to defend even &s;trong po&s;ts at all hazards, which is nece&s;&s;ary to derive the greate&s;t benefit from them. The honour of making a brave defence does not &s;eem to be a &s;ufficient &s;timulus when &s;uc|ce&s;s is very doubtful, and the falling into the enemy's hands probable: but I doubt not, this will be gradually attained. We are now in a &s;trong po&s;t, but not an impregnable one, nay, acknowledged by every man of judgment to be unten|able, unle&s;s the enemy will make the attack upon lines when they can avoid it, and their movements indicate that they mean to do &s;o.</P>
<P>To draw the whole army together in order to arrange the defence proportionate to the extent of lines and works, would leave the country open for an approach, and put the fate of this army and its &s;tores on the hazard of making a &s;ucce&s;sful defence in the city, or the i&s;&s;ue of an engagement out of it. On the other hand, to abandon a city which has been by &s;ome deemed defen&s;ible, and on who&s;e works much labour has been be&s;towed, has a tendency to di&s;pirit the troops and enfeeble our cau&s;e. It has al&s;o been con|&s;idered as the key to the northern country. But as to that, I am fully of opinion that the e&s;tabli&s;hing of &s;trong po&s;ts at Mount-Wa&s;hington on the upper part of this i&s;land, and on the Jer&s;ey &s;ide oppo&s;ite to it, with the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the ob&s;tructions already made (and which may be improved) in the water, not only the navigation of Hud&s;on's-river, but an ea&s;ier and better communication may be more effectually &s;ecured between the northern and &s;outhern States. This, I believe, every one acquainted with the &s;ituation of the country will readily agree to; and it will appear evident to tho&s;e who have an opportuni|ty of recurring to good maps.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="029737_0238_0FE2496AC199D210">
The&s;e and many other con&s;equences, which will be in|volved in the determination of our next mea&s;ure, have given our minds full employ, and led every one to form a judgment as the various objects pre&s;ented them&s;elves to his view.</P>
<P>The po&s;t at King&s;bridge is naturally &s;trong, and is pretty well fortified: the heights about it are command|ing, and might &s;oon be made more &s;o. The&s;e are im|portant objects, and I have attended to them accordingly. I have al&s;o removed from the city all the &s;tores and am|munition except what was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for its de|fence, and made every other di&s;po&s;ition that did not e&s;|&s;entially interfere with that object,&mdash;carefully keeping in view, until it &s;hould be ab&s;olutely determined on full con&s;ideration, how far the city was to be defended at all events.</P>
<P>In re&s;olving points of &s;uch importance, many circum|&s;tances peculiar to our own army al&s;o occur. Being only provided for a &s;ummer's campaign, their clothes, &s;hoes, and blankets, will &s;oon be unfit for the change of weather which we every day feel. At pre&s;ent we have not tents for more than two thirds, many of them old and worn out: but if we had a plentiful &s;upply, the &s;ea&s;on will not admit of continuing in them long. The ca&s;e of our &s;ick is al&s;o worthy of much con&s;ideration. Their number, by the returns, forms at lea&s;t one fourth of the army. Policy and humanity require they &s;hould be made as comfort|able as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>With the&s;e and many other circum&s;tances before them, the whole council of general officers met ye&s;terday in order to adopt &s;ome general line of conduct to be pur&s;ued at this important cri&s;is. I intended to have procured their &s;epa|rate opinions on each point; but time would not admit. I was therefore obliged to collect their &s;en&s;e more generally than I could have wi&s;hed. All agreed the town would not be tenable if the enemy re&s;olved to bombard and can|nonade it: but the difficulty attending a removal operated &s;o &s;trongly, that a cour&s;e was taken between abandoning it totally and concentring our whole &s;trength for its defence: nor were &s;ome a little influenced in their opinion, to whom the determination of Congre&s;s was known, again&s;t an evac|uation
<PB N="240" REF="029737_0239_0FE24919A30368D0">
totally, as they were led to &s;u&s;pect Congre&s;s wi&s;hed it to be maintained at every hazard.</P>
<P>It was concluded to arrange the army under three divi|&s;ions;&mdash;five thou&s;and to remain for the defence of the city;&mdash;nine thou&s;and to King&s;bridge and its dependencies, as well to po&s;&s;e&s;s and &s;ecure tho&s;e po&s;ts, as to be ready to attack the enemy who are moving ea&s;tward on Long-I&s;l|and, if they &s;hould attempt to land on this &s;ide;&mdash;the re|mainder to occupy the intermediate &s;pace, and &s;upport ei|ther;&mdash;that the &s;ick &s;hould be immediately removed to Orangetown, and barracks prepared at King&s;bridge with all expedition to cover the troops.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome general officers, in who&s;e judgment and opinion much confidence is to be repo&s;ed, that were for a total and immediate removal from the city,&mdash;urging the great danger of one part of the army being cut off be|fore the other can &s;upport it, the extremities being at lea&s;t &s;ixteen miles apart;&mdash;that our army, when collected, is inferior to the enemy;&mdash;that they can move with their whole force to any point of attack, and con&s;equently mu&s;t &s;ucceed by weight of numbers, if they have only a part to oppo&s;e them;&mdash;that, by removing from hence, we deprive the enemy of the advantage of their &s;hips, which will make at lea&s;t one half of the force to attack the town;&mdash;that we &s;hould keep the enemy at bay, put nothing to the hazard, but at all events keep the army together, which may be recruited another year;&mdash;that the un&s;pent &s;tores will al&s;o be pre&s;erved; and, in this ca&s;e, the heavy artille|ry can al&s;o be &s;ecured. But they were overruled by a majority, who thought for the pre&s;ent a part of our force might be kept here, and attempt to maintain the city a while longer.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible a retreating army is encircled with diffi|culties; that the declining an engagement &s;ubjects a gener|al to reproach; and that the common cau&s;e may be affect|ed by the di&s;couragement it may throw over the minds of many. Nor am I in&s;en&s;ible of the contrary effects, if a brilliant &s;troke could be made with any probability of &s;uc|ce&s;s, e&s;pecially after our lo&s;s upon Long-I&s;land. But, when the fate of America may be at &s;take on the i&s;&s;ue, when the wi&s;dom of cooler moments and experienced men
<PB N="241" REF="029737_0240_0FE2496C7A6599A8">
have decided that we &s;hould protract the war if po&s;&s;ible, I cannot think it &s;afe or wi&s;e to adopt a different &s;y&s;tem when the &s;ea&s;on for action draws &s;o near a clo&s;e.</P>
<P>That the enemy mean to winter in New-York, there can be no doubt:&mdash;that, with &s;uch an armament, they can drive us out, is equally clear. The Congre&s;s having re|&s;olved that it &s;hould not be de&s;troyed, nothing &s;eems to remain, but to determine the time of their taking po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion. It is our intere&s;t and wi&s;h to prolong it as much as po&s;&s;ible, provided the delay does not affect our future mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The militia of Connecticut is reduced, from &s;ix thou|&s;and, to le&s;s than two thou&s;and, and in a few days will be merely nominal. The arrival of &s;ome Maryland troops, &amp;c. from the flying camp, has in a great degree &s;upplied the lo&s;s of men: but the ammunition they have carried away will be a lo&s;s &s;en&s;ibly felt. The impul&s;e for going home was &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible, it an&s;wered no purpo&s;e to oppo&s;e it. Though I would not di&s;charge, I have been obliged to acquie&s;ce; and it affords one more melancholy proof, how delu&s;ive &s;uch dependencies are.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed I have the honour to tran&s;mit a general return, the fir&s;t I have been able to procure for &s;ome time; al&s;o a report of captain Newel from our works at Horn's-Hook or Hell-gate.

<P>I WAS ye&s;terday honoured with your favour of the eighth in&s;tant, accompanied by &s;undry re&s;olutions of Con|gre&s;s, to which I &s;hall pay the &s;tricte&s;t attention, and, in the in&s;tances required, make them the future rule of my conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="029737_0241_0FE2491B26231790">
The mode of nego<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iation pur&s;ued by lord Howe I did not approve of; but as general Sullivan was &s;ent out upon the bu&s;ine&s;s, and with a me&s;&s;age to Congre&s;s, I could not conceive my&s;elf at liberty to interfere in the matter, as he was in the character of a pri&s;oner, and totally &s;ubject to their power and direction.</P>
<P>The li&s;t of pri&s;oners, before omitted through hurry, is now inclo&s;ed; though it will probably have reached Con|gre&s;s before this. I &s;hall write by the fir&s;t opportunity for major Haw&s;ack&s;e to repair to Philadelphia&mdash;(he is in the northern army;)&mdash;and will al&s;o mention the &s;everal ap|pointments in con&s;equence of colonel St. Clair's promo|tion.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as generals Pre&s;cot and M^cDonald arrive, I &s;hall take mea&s;ures to advi&s;e general Howe of it, that the propo&s;ed exchange for general Sullivan and lord Stirling may be carried into execution.</P>
<P>Since my letter of the eighth, nothing material has oc|curred, except that the enemy have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of Montezore's-i&s;land, and landed a con&s;iderable number of troops upon it. This i&s;land lies in the mouth of Haerlem-river, which runs out of the Sound into the North-river, and will give the enemy an ea&s;y opportunity of landing either on the low grounds of Morri&s;ania, if their views are to &s;eize and po&s;&s;e&s;s the pa&s;&s;es above King&s;bridge, or on the plains of Haerlem, if they de&s;ign to intercept and cut off the communication between our &s;everal po&s;ts. I am making every di&s;po&s;ition and arrangement that the divided &s;tate of our troops will admit of, and which ap|pear mo&s;t likely and the be&s;t calculated to oppo&s;e their attacks; for I pre&s;ume there will be &s;everal. How the event will be, God only knows: but you may be a&s;&s;ured that nothing in my power, circum&s;tanced as I am, &s;hall be wanting, to effect a favourable and happy i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>By my letter of the eighth you would perceive that &s;everal of the council were for holding the town, con|ceiving it practicable for &s;ome time. Many of them now, upon &s;eeing our divided &s;tate, have altered their opinion, and allow the expediency and nece&s;&s;ity of concentring our whole force, or drawing it more together. Convinced of the propriety of this mea&s;ure, I am ordering our &s;tores

away, except &s;uch as may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to keep as long as any troops remain; that, if an evacuation of the city becomes inevitable (which certainly mu&s;t be the ca&s;e) there may be as little to remove as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P>HIS excellency being called from Head-Quarters to|day on bu&s;ine&s;s of importance which prevents his writing, I therefore do my&s;elf the honour to inform Congre&s;s of what has happened &s;ince his letter of ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>La&s;t evening the enemy tran&s;ported a number of men from Buchanan's to Montezore's-i&s;land, and, by their &s;everal movements, more &s;trongly indicate their intention to land &s;omewhere about Haerlem or Morri&s;ania,&mdash;mo&s;t likely, at both at the &s;ame time. This morning one of the &s;hips that have been for &s;ome time in the Sound mov|ed down towards Hell-gate; but, the tide leaving her, &s;he could not get near enough to bring her guns to bear upon our fortification. If &s;he means to attack it, it is probable &s;he will warp in the next tide. Their batteries have kept up a pretty con&s;tant fire again&s;t ours at that place, but without any con&s;iderable effect. This morn|ing they opened a new one.</P>
<P>I do not recollect any other material occurrence, and &s;hall only add, that I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favour of the tenth, with the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s which accompani|ed
<PB N="244" REF="029737_0243_0FE2491CAAF373F0">
it, and thank them for the confidence they repo&s;e i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> my judgment re&s;pecting the evacuation of the city. I could wi&s;h to maintain it, becau&s;e I know it to be of im|portance: but I am fully convinced that it cannot be done, and that an attempt for that purpo&s;e, if per&s;evered in, might and mo&s;t certainly would be attended with con&s;e|quences the mo&s;t fatal and alarming in their nature.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible of this, &s;everal of the general officers, &s;ince the determination of the council mentioned in my la&s;t, petitioned that a &s;econd council might be called to recon|&s;ider the propo&s;itions which had been before them upon the &s;ubject. Accordingly I called one on the twelfth, when a large majority not only determined a removal of the army prudent, but ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary,&mdash;declaring they were entirely convinced from a full and minute inquiry into our &s;ituation, that it was extremely perilous; and, from every movement of the enemy, and the intelligence received, their plan of operations was to get in our rear, and, by cutting off the communication with the main, oblige us to force a pa&s;&s;age through them on the terms they wi&s;h, or to become pri&s;oners in &s;ome &s;hort time for want of nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>We are now taking every method in our power to re|move the &s;tores, &amp;c, in which we find almo&s;t in&s;uperable difficulties. They are &s;o great and &s;o numerous, that I fear we &s;hall not effect the whole before we meet with &s;ome interruption. I fully expected that an attack &s;ome|where would have been made la&s;t night. In that I was di&s;appointed; and happy &s;hall I be, if my apprehen&s;ions of one to-night, or in a day or two, are not confirmed by the event. If it is deferred a little while longer, I flatter my&s;elf all will be got away, and our force be more con|centred, and of cour&s;e more likely to re&s;i&s;t them with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday afternoon, four &s;hips of war, two of forty and two of twenty-eight guns, went up the Ea&s;t-river, pa&s;&s;ing between Governor's and Long-I&s;land, and anchored about a mile above the city, oppo&s;ite Mr. Stivan&s;ent's, where the Ro&s;e man-of-war was lying before. The de&s;ign of their going not being certainly known, gives ri&s;e to various con|jectures,&mdash;&s;ome &s;uppo&s;ing they are to cover the landing of
<PB N="245" REF="029737_0244_0FE2496F84DA14A8">
a party of the enemy above the city,&mdash;others that they are to a&s;&s;i&s;t in de&s;troying our battery at Horn's-hook, that they may have a free and uninterrupted navigation in the Sound. It is an object of great importance to them, and what they are indu&s;triou&s;ly trying to effect by a pretty con&s;tant can|nonade and bombardment.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I would beg leave to mention to Congre&s;s, that the pay now allowed to nur&s;es for their at|tendance on the &s;ick is by no means adequate to their &s;er|vices; the con&s;equence of which is, that they are extremely difficult to procure: indeed they are not to be got; and we are under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ub&s;tituting in their place a number of men from the re&s;pective regiments, who&s;e &s;ervice by that means is entirely lo&s;t in the proper line of their du|ty, and but little benefit rendered to the &s;ick. The officers I have talked with upon the &s;ubject all agree that they &s;hould be allowed a dollar per week, and that for le&s;s they cannot be had.</P>
<P>Our &s;ick are extremely numerous, and we find their re|moval attended with the greate&s;t difficulty. It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> matter that employs much of our time and care; and what makes it more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing is the want of proper and convenient places for their reception. I fear their &s;ufferings will be great and many. However, nothing on my part, that humanity or policy can require, &s;hall be wanting to make them comfortable, &s;o far as the &s;tate of things will ad|mit of.</P>

<P>ON Saturday about &s;un&s;et, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ix more of the enemy's &s;hips, one or two of which were men-of-war, pa&s;&s;ed be|tween Governor's-i&s;land and Red hook, and went up the Ea&s;t-river to the &s;tation taken by tho&s;e mentioned in my la&s;t. In half an hour I received two expre&s;&s;es,&mdash;one from colonel Serjeant at Horn's-hook [Hell-gate] giving an account that the enemy, to the amount of three or four thou&s;and, had ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ched to the river, and were embarking
<PB N="246" REF="029737_0245_0FE24924E536D330">
for Barns's or Montezore's-i&s;land, where numbers of them were then encamped;&mdash;the other from general Mifflin, that uncommon and formidable movements were di&s;covered among the enemy; which being confirmed by the &s;couts I had &s;ent out, I proceeded to Haerlem, where it was &s;uppo&s;ed (or at Morri&s;ania oppo&s;ite to it) the principal at|tempt to land would be made. However, nothing re|markable happened that night: but in the morning they began their operations. Three &s;hips of war came up the North-river as high as Bloomingdale, which put a total &s;top to the removal, by water, of any more of our provi|&s;ion, &amp;c. and about eleven o'clock tho&s;e in the Ea&s;t-river began a mo&s;t &s;evere and heavy cannonade, to &s;cour the grounds, and cover the landing of their troops between Turtle-bay and the city, where brea&s;tworks had been thrown up to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I heard the firing, I rode with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch towards the place of landing, when, to my great &s;urpri&s;e and mortification, I found the troops that had been po&s;ted in the lines retreating with the utmo&s;t precipitation, and tho&s;e ordered to &s;upport them (Par&s;ons's and Fellows's brigades) flying in every direction, and in the greate&s;t con|fu&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding the exertions of their generals to form them. I u&s;ed every means in my power to rally and get them into &s;ome order: but my attempts were fruitle&s;s and ineffectual; and on the appearance of a &s;mall party of the enemy, not more than &s;ixty or &s;eventy, their di&s;order increa&s;ed, and they ran away in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion, without firing a &s;ingle &s;hot.</P>
<P>Finding that no confidence was to be placed in the&s;e brigades, and apprehending that another party of the ene|my might pa&s;s over to Haerlem plains and cut off the re|treat to this place, I &s;ent orders to &s;ecure the heights in the be&s;t manner with the troops that were &s;tationed on and near them; which being done, the retreat was effected with but little or no lo&s;s of men, though, of a con&s;iderable part of our baggage,&mdash;occa&s;ioned by this di&s;graceful and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;tardly conduct. Mo&s;t of our heavy cannon, and a part of our &s;tores and provi&s;ions which we were about removing, was unavoidably left in the city, though every means (after
<PB N="247" REF="029737_0246_0FE2497B31964A48">
it had been determined in council to evacuate the po&s;t) had been u&s;ed to prevent it.</P>
<P>We are now encamped with the main body of the army on the heights of Haerlem, where I &s;hould hope the ene|my would meet with a defeat in ca&s;e of an attack, if the generality of our troops would behave with tolerable brave|ry. But experience to my extreme affliction has convinc|ed me, that this is rather to be wi&s;hed for than expected. However, I tru&s;t that there are many who will act like men, and &s;hew them&s;elves worthy of the ble&s;&s;ings of freedom.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent out &s;ome reconnoitring parties to gain intel|ligence, if po&s;&s;ible, of the di&s;po&s;ition of the enemy, and &s;hall inform Congre&s;s of every material event by the earlie&s;t opportunity.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my letter of the &s;ixteenth contained intelligence of an important nature, and &s;uch as might lead Congre&s;s to expect that the evacuation of New-York and retreat to the heights of Haerlem, in the manner they were made, would be &s;ucceeded by &s;ome other intere&s;ting event, I beg leave to inform them that as yet nothing has been attempt|ed upon a large and general pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of attack.</P>
<P>About the time of the po&s;t's departure with my letter, the enemy appeared in &s;everal large bodies upon the plains about two and a half miles from hence. I rode down to our advanced po&s;ts, to put matters in a proper &s;ituation if they &s;hould attempt to come on. When I arrived there I heard a firing, which, I was informed, was between a party of our rangers under the command of lieutenant-col|onel Knolton, and an advanced party of the enemy. Our men came in and told me that the body of the enemy, who kept them&s;elves concealed, con&s;i&s;ted of about three hundred as near as they could gue&s;s. I immediately ordered three companies of colonel Weeden's regiment from Virginia, under the command of major Leitch, and colonel Knolton with his rangers compo&s;ed of volunteers from different
<PB N="248" REF="029737_0247_0FE2497CB458C1C0">
New-England regiments to try to get in their rear, while a di&s;po&s;ition was making as if to attack them in front, and thereby draw their whole attention that way.</P>
<P>This took effect as I wi&s;hed on the part of the enemy. On the appearance of our party in front, they immediately ran down the hill, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome fences and bu&s;h|es, and a &s;mart firing began, but at too great a di&s;tance to do much execution on either &s;ide. The parties under col|onel Knolton and major Leitch unluckily began their at|tack too &s;oon, as it was rather in flank than in rear. In a little time major Leitch was brought off wounded, having received three balls through his &s;ide; and in a &s;hort time after colonel Knolton got a wound which proved mortal. Their men however per&s;evered, and continued the engage|ment with the greate&s;t re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Finding that they wanted a &s;upport, I advanced part of colonel Griffith's and colonel Richard&s;on's Maryland regi|ments, with &s;ome detachments from the ea&s;tern regiments who were neare&s;t the place of action. The&s;e troops charg|ed the enemy with great intrepidity, and drove them from the wood into the plain, and were pu&s;hing them from thence (having &s;ilenced their fire in a great mea&s;ure) when I judged it prudent to order a retreat, fearing the enemy (as I have &s;ince found was really the ca&s;e) were &s;ending a large body to &s;upport their party.</P>
<P>Major Leitch, I am in hopes, will recover: but colonel Knolton's fall is much to be regretted, as that of a brave and good officer. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad about forty wounded: the number of &s;lain is not yet a&s;certained: but it is very in|con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>By a &s;ergeant who de&s;erted from the enemy and came in this morning, I find that their party was greater than I imagined. It con&s;i&s;ted of the &s;econd battalion of light in|fantry, a battalion of the royal Highlanders, and three companies of He&s;&s;ian riflemen, under the command of brigadier-general Le&s;lie. The de&s;erter reports that their lo&s;s in wounded and mi&s;&s;ing was eighty-nine, and eight killed. In the latter, his account is too &s;mall, as our peo|ple di&s;covered and buried double that number. This af|fair, I am in hopes, will be attended with many &s;alutary con&s;equences, as it &s;eems to have greatly in&s;pirited the
<PB N="249" REF="029737_0248_0FE2497E378FB1A0">
whole of our troops. The &s;ergeant further adds that a con&s;iderable body of men are now encamped from the Ea&s;t to the North-river, between the &s;even and eight-mile &s;tones, under the command of general Clinton. General Howe, he believes, has his quarters at Mr. Apthorp's hou&s;e.</P>

<P>I HAVE been honoured with your favour of the &s;ix|teenth with its inclo&s;ures. To prevent the injury and
<PB N="250" REF="029737_0249_0FE24979AD2C6C30">
abu&s;es which would ari&s;e from the militia and other troops carrying away ammunition and continental property, I have publi&s;hed the &s;ub&s;tance of the re&s;olves upon the &s;ubject in general orders.</P>
<P>Since my letter of ye&s;terday, nothing of importance has ca&s;t up. The enemy are forming a large and exten&s;ive encampment in the plains mentioned in my la&s;t, and are bu&s;ily employed in tran&s;porting their cannon and &s;tores from Long-I&s;land. As they advance them this way, we may rea&s;onably expect their operations will not long be deferred.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed are &s;undry letters, &amp;c. to which Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to pay &s;uch regard as they may think them de|&s;erving of. The letter from mon&s;ieur . . . . . came open under cover of one to me. Tho&s;e from colonel Hand and colonel Ward contain a li&s;t of vacancies in their regi|ments, and of the per&s;ons they e&s;teem proper to fill them. The former, I believe, returned no li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t before: the latter &s;ays he never got any commi&s;&s;ions. Generals Howe and Er&s;kine's proclamations &s;hew the mea&s;ures that have been pur&s;ued, to force and &s;educe the inhabitants of Long-I&s;land from their allegiance to the States, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t in their de&s;truction.</P>
<P>As the period will &s;oon arrive, when the troops com|po&s;ing the pre&s;ent army (a few excepted) will be di&s;band|ed according to the tenor of their enli&s;tments, and the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences may en&s;ue if a &s;uitable and timely pro|vi&s;ion is not made in this in&s;tance, I take the liberty of &s;ugge&s;ting to Congre&s;s not only the expediency but the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity there is that their earlie&s;t attention &s;hould be had to this &s;ubject. In re&s;pect to the time that troops &s;hould be engaged for, I have frequently given my &s;enti|ments; nor have I omitted to expre&s;s my opinion of the difficulties that will attend rai&s;ing them, nor of the imprac|ticability of effecting it without the allowance of a large and extraordinary bounty.</P>
<P>It is a melancholy and painful con&s;ideration to tho&s;e who are concerned in the work and have the command, to be forming armies con&s;tantly, and to be left by troops ju&s;t when they begin to de&s;erve the name, or perhaps at a moment when an important blow is expected. This, I
<PB N="251" REF="029737_0250_0FE249DD2AE92350">
am informed, will be the ca&s;e at Ticonderoga with part of the troops there, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;y&s;tem is immediately come into, by which they can be induced to &s;tay. General Schuyler tells me in a letter received ye&s;terday, that De Haas's, Maxwell's, and Wind's regiments &s;tand engaged only till the beginning of next month, and that the men, he is fearful, will not remain longer than the time of their enli&s;tment.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o beg leave to mention to Congre&s;s, that the &s;ea&s;on is fa&s;t approaching when clothes of every kind will be wanted for the army. Their di&s;tre&s;s is already great, and will be increa&s;ed as the weather becomes more &s;evere. Our &s;ituation is now bad, but is much better than that of the militia that are coming to join us from the States of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay and Connecticut in con&s;equence of the requi&s;ition of Congre&s;s. They, I am informed, have not a &s;ingle tent or a nece&s;&s;ary of any kind; nor can I conceive how it will be po&s;&s;ible to &s;upport them. The&s;e circum&s;tances are extremely alarming, and oblige me to wi&s;h Congre&s;s to have all the tents, clothing of every kind, and camp nece&s;&s;aries, provided and forwarded, that are to be procured. The&s;e ea&s;tern reinforcements have not a &s;ingle nece&s;&s;ary, not a pan or a kettle,&mdash;in which we are now greatly deficient. It is with reluctance that I trouble Congre&s;s with the&s;e matters: but to whom can I re&s;ort for relief unle&s;s to them? The nece&s;&s;ity therefore, which urges the application, will excu&s;e it, I am per&s;uaded.</P>
<P>I have not been able to tran&s;mit Congre&s;s a general re|turn of the army this week, owing to the peculiar &s;ituation of our affairs, and the great &s;hifting and changing among the troops. As &s;oon as I can procure one, a copy &s;hall be forwarded to Congre&s;s.</P>

which ought to characterize a man of candour, and with the freedom which may be u&s;ed in giving u&s;eful informa|tion without incurring the imputation of pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>We are now, as it were, upon the eve of another di&s;&s;o|lution of our army. The remembrance of the difficulties which happened upon the occa&s;ion la&s;t year, the con&s;e|quences which might have followed the change if proper advantages had been taken by the enemy, added to a knowledge of the pre&s;ent temper and &s;ituation of the troops, reflect but a very gloomy pro&s;pect upon the appearances of things now, and &s;atisfy me beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, that, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;peedy and effectual mea&s;ures are adopted by Congre&s;s, our cau&s;e will be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>It is in vain to expect that any or more than a trifling part of this army will again engage in the &s;ervice on the encour|agement offered by Congre&s;s. When men find that their town&s;men and companions are receiving twenty, thirty, and more dollars, for a few months' &s;ervice (which is truly the ca&s;e,) it cannot be expected, without u&s;ing compul&s;ion; and to force them into the &s;ervice would an&s;wer no valua|ble purpo&s;e. When men are irritated, and the pa&s;&s;ions in|flamed, they fly ha&s;tily and cheerfully to arms: but after the fir&s;t emotions are over * * *, a &s;oldier, rea&s;oned with upon the goodne&s;s of the cau&s;e he is engaged in and the ine&s;timable rights he is contending for, hears you with pa|tience, and acknowledges the truth of your ob&s;ervations, but adds that it is of no more importance to him than others. The officer makes you the &s;ame reply, with this further remark, that his pay will not &s;upport him, and he cannot ruin him&s;elf and family to &s;erve his country, when every member of the community is equally intere&s;ted and benefited by his labours. * * *</P>
<P>It becomes evidently clear then, that, as this conte&s;t is not likely to be the work of a day,&mdash;as the war mu&s;t be carried on &s;y&s;tematically,&mdash;and to do it you mu&s;t have good officers,&mdash;there are, in my judgment, no other po&s;&s;ible means to obtain them but by e&s;tabli&s;hing your army upon a permanent footing, and giving your officers good pay. This will induce gentlemen and men of character to en|gage: and, till the bulk of your officers are compo&s;ed of &s;uch per&s;ons as are actuated by principles of honour and a
<PB N="254" REF="029737_0253_0FE24989AFD18038">
&s;pirit of enterpri&s;e, you have little to expect from them. They ought to have &s;uch allowances as will enable them to live like and &s;upport the characters of gentlemen. * * * Be&s;ides, &s;omething is due to the man who puts his life in <HI>[your]</HI> hands, hazards his health, and for&s;akes the &s;weets of dome&s;tic enjoyment. Why a captain in the continen|tal &s;ervice &s;hould receive no more than five &s;hillings cur|rency per day for performing the &s;ame duties that an officer of the &s;ame rank in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice receives ten &s;hillings &s;terling for, I never could conceive, e&s;pecially when the latter is provided with every nece&s;&s;ary he requires upon the be&s;t terms, and the former can &s;carce procure them at any rate. There is nothing that gives a man con&s;equence and renders him fit for command, like a &s;upport that renders him independent of every body but the State he &s;erves.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the men, nothing but a good bounty can obtain them upon a permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment: and for no &s;horter time than the continuance of the war, ought they to be engaged; as facts inconte&s;tibly prove that the diffi|culty and co&s;t of enli&s;tments increa&s;e with time. When the army was fir&s;t rai&s;ed at Cambridge, I am per&s;uaded the men might have been got, without a bounty, for the war. After this, they began to &s;ee that the conte&s;t was not likely to end &s;o &s;peedily as was imagined, and to feel their con&s;equence by remarking, that, to get in the militia in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year, many towns were induced to give them a bounty.</P>
<P>Fore&s;eeing the evils re&s;ulting from this, and the de|&s;tructive con&s;equences which unavoidably would follow &s;hort enli&s;tments, I took the liberty in a long letter (date not now recollected, as my letter-book is not here) to rec|ommend the enli&s;tments for and during the war, a&s;&s;igning &s;uch rea&s;ons for it as experience has &s;ince convinced me were well founded. At that time, twenty dollars would, I am per&s;uaded, have engaged the men for this term. But it will not do to look back: and, if the pre&s;ent opportunity is &s;lipped, I am per&s;uaded that twelve months more will increa&s;e our difficulties four-fold. I &s;hall therefore take the freedom of giving it as my opinion, that a good bounty be immediately offered, aided by the proffer of at lea&s;t a hundred or a hundred and fifty acres of land, and a &s;uit of
<PB N="255" REF="029737_0254_0FE249E097E43218">
clothes and blanket to each non-commi&s;&s;ioned officer and &s;oldier; as I have good authority for &s;aying, that, however high the men's pay may appear, it is barely &s;ufficient, in the pre&s;ent &s;carcity and dearne&s;s of all kinds of goods, to keep them in clothes, much le&s;s afford &s;upport to their families.</P>
<P>If this encouragement then is given to the men, and &s;uch pay allowed the officers as will induce gentlemen of character and liberal &s;entiments to engage, and proper care and precaution u&s;ed in the nomination (having more re|gard to the characters of per&s;ons than the number of men they can enli&s;t,) we &s;hould in a little time have an army able to cope with any that can be oppo&s;ed to it, as there are excellent materials to form one out of. But while the only merit an officer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es is his ability to rai&s;e men,&mdash;while tho&s;e men con&s;ider and treat him as an equal, and (in the character of an officer) regard him no more than a broom&s;tick, being mixed together as one common herd, no order nor di&s;cipline can prevail; nor will the officer ever meet with that re&s;pect which is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to due &s;ubordination.</P>
<P>To place any dependence upon militia is a&s;&s;uredly re&s;t|ing upon a broken &s;taff,&mdash;men ju&s;t dragged from the ten|der &s;cenes of dome&s;tic life,&mdash;unaccu&s;tomed to the din of arms,&mdash;totally unacquainted with every kind of military &s;kill; which being followed by a want of confidence in them&s;elves, when oppo&s;ed to troops regularly trained, di&s;|ciplined, and appointed, &s;uperior in knowledge and &s;upe|rior in arms, makes them timid and ready to fly from their own &s;hadows. Be&s;ides, the &s;udden change in their man|ner of living (particularly in the lodging) brings on &s;ick|ne&s;s in many, impatience in all, and &s;uch an unconquera|ble de&s;ire of returning to their re&s;pective homes, that it not only produces &s;hameful and &s;candalous de&s;ertions among them&s;elves, but infu&s;es the like &s;pirit into others.</P>
<P>Again; men accu&s;tomed to unbounded freedom and no control, cannot brook the re&s;traint which is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to the good order and government of an army; without which, licentiou&s;ne&s;s and every kind of di&s;order triumphantly reign. To bring men to a proper degree of &s;ubordination is not the work of a day, a month, or even
<PB N="256" REF="029737_0255_0FE2498B34D5F870">
a year: and, unhappily for us and the cau&s;e we are enga|ged in, the little di&s;cipline I have been labouring to e&s;tab|li&s;h in the army under my immediate command is in a manner done away, by having &s;uch a mixture of troops as have been called together within the&s;e few months.</P>
<P>Relaxed and unfit as our rules and regulations of war are for the government of an army, the militia (tho&s;e prop|erly &s;o called; for of the&s;e we have two &s;orts, the &s;ix-months-men, and tho&s;e &s;ent in as a temporary aid) do not think them&s;elves &s;ubject to them, and therefore take liber|ties which the &s;oldier is puni&s;hed for. This creates jeal|ou&s;y: jealou&s;y begets di&s;&s;atisfactions; and the&s;e by de|grees ripen into mutiny, keeping the whole army in a con|fu&s;ed and di&s;ordered &s;tate,&mdash;rendering the time of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to &s;ee regularity and good order prevail, more un|happy than words can de&s;cribe. Be&s;ides this, &s;uch repeated changes take place, that all arrangement is &s;et at nought, and the con&s;tant fluctuation of things deranges every plan as fa&s;t as adopted.</P>
<P>The&s;e, Sir, Congre&s;s may be a&s;&s;ured, are but a &s;mall part of the inconveniences which might be enumerated, and attributed to militia: but there is one that merits particular attention, and that is the expen&s;e. Certain I am, that it would be cheaper to keep fifty or a hundred thou&s;and in con&s;tant pay, than to depend upon half the number and &s;upply the other half occa&s;ionally by militia. The time the latter are in pay before and after they are in camp, a&s;&s;embling and marching,&mdash;the wa&s;te of ammu|nition, the con&s;umption of &s;tores, which, in &s;pite of every re&s;olution or requi&s;ition of Congre&s;s, they mu&s;t be furni&s;h|ed with, or &s;ent home,&mdash;added to other incidental ex|pen&s;es con&s;equent upon their coming and conduct in camp, &s;urpa&s;&s;es all idea, and de&s;troys every kind of regularity and economy which you could e&s;tabli&s;h among fixed and &s;et|tled troops, and will, in my opinion, prove (if the &s;cheme is adhered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">) the ruin of our cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The jealou&s;ies of a &s;tanding army, and the evils to be apprehended from one, are remote, and, in my judgment, &s;ituated and circum&s;tanced as we are, not at all to be dreaded: but the con&s;equences of wanting one, according to my ideas formed from the pre&s;ent view of things, is
<PB N="257" REF="029737_0256_0FE249E21B8CC7B8">
certain and inevitable ruin. For, if I was called upon to declare upon oath, whether the militia have been mo&s;t &s;erviceable or hurtful upon the whole, I &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe to the latter. I do not mean by this, however, to arraign the conduct of Congre&s;s: in &s;o doing I &s;hould equally con|demn my own mea&s;ures, if I did not my judgment: but experience, which is the be&s;t criterion to work by, &s;o fully, clearly and deci&s;ively reprobates the practice of tru&s;ting to militia, that no man who regards order, regularity and economy, or who has any regard for his own honour, char|acter, or peace of mind, will ri&s;k them upon this i&s;&s;ue. * * *</P>
<P>An army formed of good officers moves like clock|work: but there is no &s;ituation upon earth le&s;s enviable nor more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing than that per&s;on's wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">s at the head of troops who are regardle&s;s of order and di&s;cipline, and who are unprovided with almo&s;t every nece&s;&s;ary. In a word, the difficulties which have forever &s;urrounded me &s;ince I have been in the &s;ervice, and kept my mind con|&s;tantly upon the &s;tretch,&mdash;the wounds which my feelings (as an officer) have received by a thou&s;and things which have happened contrary to my expectation and wi&s;hes, * * *&mdash;added to a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my inability to gov|ern an army compo&s;ed of &s;uch di&s;cordant parts, and under &s;uch a variety of intricate and perplexing circum&s;tances,&mdash;induce not only a belief, but a thorough conviction in my mind, that it will be impo&s;&s;ible (unle&s;s there is a thorough change in our military &s;y&s;tem) for me to conduct matters in &s;uch a manner as to give &s;atisfaction to the public, which is all the recompen&s;e I aim at, or ever wi&s;hed for.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I mu&s;t apologize for the liberties taken in this letter, and for the blots and &s;cratchings there|in, not having time to give it more correctly. With truth I can add, that, with every &s;entiment of re&s;pect and e&s;teem,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING wrote you fully on &s;undry important &s;ubjects this morning, as you will perceive by the letter which accompanies this, I mean principally now to inclo&s;e
<PB N="258" REF="029737_0257_0FE2498CB7929FA0">
a copy of a letter received from general Howe on Sunday morning, with the li&s;ts of the pri&s;oners in his hands,&mdash;of tho&s;e in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion belonging to the army immediately under his command,&mdash;and of my an&s;wer, which were omitted to be put in the other. His letter will di&s;cover to Congre&s;s his refu&s;al to exchange lord Stirling for Mr. M^cDonald, con&s;idering the latter only as a major. They will be plea&s;ed to determine how he is to be ranked in future.</P>
<P>The number of pri&s;oners according to the&s;e returns is greater than what we expected. However, I am inclined to believe, that, among tho&s;e in the li&s;t from Long-I&s;land, are &s;everal militia of general Woodhull's party, who were never arranged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this army. As to tho&s;e taken on the fifteenth, they greatly exceed the number that I &s;uppo&s;ed fell into their hands in the retreat from the city. At the time that I tran&s;mitted an account of that affair, I had not obtained returns, and took the matter upon the offi|cers' reports. They are difficult to get with certainty at any time. In the &s;kirmi&s;h of Monday &s;e'nnight, they could have taken but very few.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I &s;hall take occa&s;ion to mention that tho&s;e returns made with &s;uch preci&s;ion, and the difficulty that will attend the propo&s;ed exchange on account of the di&s;per&s;ed and &s;cattered &s;tate of the pri&s;oners in our hands, will clearly evince the nece&s;&s;ity of appointing commi&s;&s;aries and proper per&s;ons to &s;uperintend and conduct in &s;uch in|&s;tances. This I took the liberty of urging more than once, as well on account of the propriety of the mea&s;ure and the &s;aving that would have re&s;ulted from it, as that the pri&s;on|ers might be treated with humanity, and have their wants particularly attended to.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o ob&s;erve (as I e&s;teem it my duty) that this army is in want of almo&s;t every nece&s;&s;ary,&mdash;tents, camp kettles, blankets, and clothes of all kinds. But what is to be done with re&s;pect to the two la&s;t articles, I know not, as the term of enli&s;tment will be nearly expired by the time they can be provided. This may be exhibited as a further proof of the di&s;advantages attending the levy|ing of an army upon &s;uch a footing as never to know how to keep them without injuring the public or incommoding

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour of tran&s;mitting to you the inclo&s;ed letter from lieutenant-colonel Living&s;ton, with &s;undry copies of general Delancey's orders, which di&s;cover the mea&s;ures the enemy are pur&s;uing on Long-I&s;land for rai&s;ing recruits and obtaining &s;upplies of provi&s;ions. In con|&s;equence of the intelligence they contain, and authentic advices through other channels re&s;pecting th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e matters, I have &s;ent brigadier-general George Clinton to meet gener|al Lincoln, who has got as far as Fairfield with part of the troops lately ordered by the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts a&s;&s;embly, to concert with him and others an expedition acro&s;s the Sound with tho&s;e troops, three companies under colonel Living&s;ton, and &s;uch further aid as governor. Trumbull can afford, in order to prevent if po&s;&s;ible their effecting tho&s;e important objects, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t the inhabitants in the removal of their &s;tock, grain, &amp;c. or in de&s;troying them, that the enemy may not derive any advantage or benefit from them.</P>
<P>The recruiting &s;cheme they are pro&s;ecuting with un|common indu&s;try; nor is it confined to Long-I&s;land alone. Having ju&s;t now received a letter from the committee of We&s;t-Che&s;ter county, advi&s;ing that there are &s;everal com|panies of men in that and Duche&s;s county preparing to go off and join the king's army, I have given directions to our guard-boats and the centries at our works at Mount-Wa&s;hington to keep a &s;trict look-out in ca&s;e they attempt to come down the North-river; al&s;o to general Heath at King&s;bridge, that the utmo&s;t vigilance may be ob&s;erved by the regiments and troops &s;tationed above there and down
<PB N="262" REF="029737_0261_0FE24996EFAE44B0">
towards the Ea&s;t-river, that they may intercept them, &s;hould they take that route with a view of cro&s;&s;ing to Long-I&s;land. I will u&s;e every precaution in my power to pre|vent tho&s;e parricides from accompli&s;hing their de&s;igns: but I have but little hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, as it will be no difficult matter for them to procure a pa&s;&s;age over &s;ome part or other of the Sound.</P>
<P>I have been applied to lately by colonel Weedon of Vir|ginia, for permi&s;&s;ion to recruit the deficiency of men in his regiment out of the troops compo&s;ing the flying camp,&mdash;informing me at the &s;ame time that &s;ome of tho&s;e from Maryland had offered to engage. Colonel Hand of the rifle battalion made a &s;imilar application to-day. If the enli&s;tments could be made, they would have this good con&s;equence,&mdash;the &s;ecuring of &s;o many in the &s;ervice. However, as the mea&s;ure might occa&s;ion &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s in their own corps, and be con&s;idered as a hard&s;hip by the States to which they belong, and the means of their fur|ni&s;hing more than the quota extracted from them in the general arrangement, and would make it more difficult for them to complete their own levies, I did not conceive my&s;elf at liberty to authori&s;e it without &s;ubmitting the pro|priety of it to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, and obtain|ing their opinion whether it &s;hould be allowed or not.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a li&s;t of warrants granted from the &s;ec|ond to the thirtieth ultimo inclu&s;ive, the only return of the &s;ort that I have been able to make &s;ince the re&s;olution for that purpo&s;e,&mdash;owing to the un&s;ettled &s;tate of our affairs, and my having &s;ent my papers away. You will al&s;o receive &s;undry letters, &amp;c. from general Schuyler, which came under cover to me, and which I have the honour of for|warding.</P>
<P>By a letter ju&s;t received from the committee of &s;afety of the State of New-Hamp&s;hire, I find a thou&s;and of their militia were about to march on the twenty-fourth ultimo to reinforce this army in con&s;equence of the requi&s;ition of Congre&s;s. Previous to their march, general Ward writes me he was obliged to furni&s;h them with five hundred pounds of powder and a thou&s;and pounds of mu&s;ket-ball; and I have little rea&s;on to expect that they are better pro|vided with other articles than they were with ammunition.

In &s;uch ca&s;e they will only add to our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s which is already far too great, and become di&s;gu&s;ted with the &s;ervice, though the time they are engaged for is only till the fir&s;t of December. This will injure their enli&s;ting for a longer term, if not wholly prevent it.</P>
<P>By three de&s;erters who came from the Galatea man-of-war about five days ago, we are informed that &s;everal tran&s;|ports had &s;ailed, before they left her, for England, as it was generally reported, in order to return with a &s;upply of provi&s;ions, of which they &s;ay there is a want. General Mercer, in a letter, informed me that general Thomp&s;on &s;aid he had heard they were going to di&s;mi&s;s about a hun|dred of the &s;hips from the &s;ervice. I am al&s;o advi&s;ed by a letter from Mr. Derby at Bo&s;ton, of the twenty-&s;ixth ultimo, that, the day before, a tran&s;port &s;now had been taken and &s;ent into Pi&s;cataqua by a privateer, in her pa&s;&s;age from New-York to the We&s;t-Indies. She &s;ailed with five more under the convoy of a man-of-war, in order to bring from thence the troops that are there, to join general Howe. They were all victualled for four months. From this intelligence it would &s;eem as if they did not apprehend any thing to be meditating again&s;t them by the court of France.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 3. I have nothing in particular to commu|nicate re&s;pecting our &s;ituation, it being much the &s;ame as when I wrote la&s;t. We had an alarm this morning a lit|tle before four o'clock, from &s;ome of our out-centries, who reported that a large body of the enemy was advan|cing towards our lines. This put us in motion: however, it turned out entirely premature; or at lea&s;t we &s;aw noth|ing of them.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE I knew of the late re&s;olutions of Con|gre&s;s which you did me the honour to inclo&s;e in your let|ter of the twenty-fourth, and before I was favoured with the vi&s;it of your committee, I took the liberty of giving you my &s;entiments on &s;everal points which &s;eemed to be
<PB N="264" REF="029737_0263_0FE2499874801FE0">
of importance. I have no doubt but that the committee will make &s;uch report of the &s;tate and condition of the army, as will induce Congre&s;s to believe that nothing but the mo&s;t vigorous exertions can put matters upon &s;uch a footing as to give this continent a fair pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. Give me leave to &s;ay, Sir,&mdash;I &s;ay it with due deference and re&s;pect (and my knowledge of the facts, added to the importance of the cau&s;e, and the &s;take I hold in it, mu&s;t ju&s;tify the freedom,)&mdash;that your affairs are in a more unpromi&s;ing way than you &s;eem to apprehend.</P>
<P>Your army, as I mentioned in my la&s;t, is on the eve of its political di&s;&s;olution. True it is, you have voted a larger one in lieu of it: but the &s;ea&s;on is late; and there is a material difference between voting of battalions and rai&s;ing of men. In the latter there are more difficulties than Congre&s;s are aware of; which makes it my duty (as I have been informed of the prevailing &s;entiments of this army) to inform them, that, unle&s;s the pay of the of|ficers, e&s;pecially that of the field-officers, is rai&s;ed, the chief part of tho&s;e that are worth retaining will leave the &s;ervice at the expiration of the pre&s;ent term, as the &s;oldiers will al&s;o, if &s;ome greater encouragement is not offered them than twenty dollars and a hundred acres of land.</P>
<P>Nothing le&s;s, in my opinion, than a &s;uit of clothes an|nually given to each non-commi&s;&s;ioned officer and &s;oldier&punc; in addition to the pay and bounty, will avail; and I que&s;|tion whether that will do, as the enemy (from the infor|mation of one John Ma&s;h, who, with &s;ix others, was ta|ken by our guards) are giving ten pounds bounty for re|cruits, and have got a battalion under major Rogers nearly completed upon Long-I&s;land.</P>
<P>Nor will le&s;s pay, according to my judgment, than I have taken the liberty of mentioning in the inclo&s;ed e&s;ti|mate, retain &s;uch officers as we could wi&s;h to have contin|ued. The difference per month in each battalion will amount to better than a hundred pounds. To this may be added the pay of the &s;taff-officers; for it is pre&s;umable they will al&s;o require an augmentation: but, being few in number, the &s;um will not be greatly increa&s;ed by them, and con&s;equently is a matter of no great moment: but it is a matter of no &s;mall importance to make the &s;everal of|fices
<PB N="265" REF="029737_0264_0FE249F099821338">
de&s;irable. When the pay and e&s;tabli&s;hment of an officer once become objects of intere&s;ted attention, the &s;loth, negligence, and even di&s;obedience of orders, which at this time but too generally prevail, will be purged off. But while the &s;ervice is viewed with indifference,&mdash;while the officer conceives that he is rather conferring than receiving an obligation,&mdash;there will be a total relaxation of all order and di&s;cipline, and every thing will move heavily on, to the great detriment of the &s;ervice, and inexpre&s;&s;ible trouble and vexation of the general.</P>
<P>The critical &s;ituation of our affairs at this time will ju&s;|tify my &s;aying that no time is to be lo&s;t in making of fruit|le&s;s experiments. An unavailing trial of a month to get an army upon the terms propo&s;ed may render it impracti|cable to do it at all, and prove fatal to our cau&s;e; as I am not &s;ure whether any rubs in the way of our enli&s;t|ments, or unfavourable turn in our affairs, may not prove the means of the enemy recruiting men fa&s;ter than we do. To this may be added the inextricable difficulty of form|ing one corps out of another, and arranging matters with any degree of order, in the face of an enemy who are watching for advantages.</P>
<P>At Cambridge, la&s;t year, where the officers (and more than a &s;ufficiency of them) were all upon the &s;pot, we found it a work of &s;uch extreme difficulty to know their &s;entiments (each having &s;ome terms to propo&s;e) that I de&s;paired once of getting the arrangements completed: and I do &s;uppo&s;e, that at lea&s;t a hundred alterations took place before matters were finally adju&s;ted. What mu&s;t it be then under the pre&s;ent regulation, where the officer is to negociate this matter with the State he comes from, di&s;tant perhaps two or three hundred miles?&mdash;&s;ome of whom, without leave or licen&s;e from me, &s;et out to make per&s;onal application, the moment the re&s;olve got to their hands. What kind of officers the&s;e are, I leave Congre&s;s to judge.</P>
<P>If an officer of reputation (for none other &s;hould be applied to) is a&s;ked to &s;tay, what an&s;wer can he give, but in the fir&s;t place, that he does not know whether it is at his option to do &s;o, no provi&s;ion being made in the re&s;olu|tion of Congre&s;s, even recommendatory of this mea&s;ure;
<PB N="266" REF="029737_0265_0FE24999F6888A70">
con&s;equently, that it re&s;ts with the State he comes from (&s;urrounded perhaps with a variety of applications, and influenced probably by local attachments) to determine whether he can be provided for or not? In the next place, if he is an officer of merit, and knows that the State he comes from is to furni&s;h more battalions than it at pre&s;ent has in the &s;ervice, he will &s;carcely, after two years' faith|ful &s;ervices, think of continuing in the rank he now bears, when new creations are to be made, and men appointed to offices (nowi&s;e &s;uperior in merit, and ignorant perhaps of &s;ervice) over his head. A committee, &s;ent to the army from each State, may upon the &s;pot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ix things with a de|gree of propriety and certainty, and is the only method I can &s;ee of bringing matters to a deci&s;ion with re&s;pect to the officers of the army. But what can be done in the meanwhile towards the arrangement in the country, I know not. In the one ca&s;e you run the hazard of lo&s;ing your officers; in the other, of encountering delay, unle&s;s &s;ome method could be devi&s;ed of forwarding both at the &s;ame in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Upon the pre&s;ent plan, I plainly fore&s;ee an intervention of time between the old and new army, which mu&s;t be fil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed up with militia (if to be had) with whom no man who has any regard for his own reputation can undertake to be an&s;werable for con&s;equences. I &s;hall al&s;o be mi&s;taken in my conjectures, if we do not lo&s;e the mo&s;t valuable offi|cers in this army, under the pre&s;ent mode of appointing them: con&s;equently, if we have an army at all, it will be compo&s;ed of materials not only entirely raw, but (if un|common pains are not taken) entirely unfit: and I &s;ee &s;uch a di&s;tru&s;t and jealou&s;y of military power, that the commander in chief has not an opportunity, even by rec|ommendation, to give the lea&s;t a&s;&s;urances of reward for the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices. In a word, &s;uch a cloud of perplexing circum&s;tances appear before me, without one flattering hope, that I am thoroughly convinced, unle&s;s the mo&s;t vigorous and deci&s;ive exertions are immediately adopted to remedy the&s;e evils, that the certain and ab&s;o|lute lo&s;s of our liberties will be the inevitable con&s;equence; as one unhappy &s;troke will throw a powerful weight into the &s;cale again&s;t us, enabling general Howe to recruit his

<P>I a&s;k pardon for taking up &s;o much of their time with my opinions. But I &s;hould betray that tru&s;t which they and my country have repo&s;ed in me, were I to be &s;ilent upon a matter &s;o extremely intere&s;ting. With the mo&s;t perfect e&s;teem, I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS la&s;t night honoured with your favour of the &s;econd with &s;undry re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s. * * *</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the exchange of pri&s;oners, I fear it will be a work of great difficulty, owing to their di&s;per&s;ed and &s;cattered &s;ituation throughout the States. In order to ef|fect it, I have wrote to the ea&s;tern governments to have them collected, and to tran&s;mit me an account of their number, di&s;tingui&s;hing the names and ranks of the field and commi&s;&s;ioned officers, and the corps they belong to. I have al&s;o wrote to governor Living&s;ton of the Jer&s;eys up|on the &s;ubject, and mu&s;t take the liberty of reque&s;ting Con|gre&s;s to give directions that a &s;imilar return may be made of tho&s;e in Penn&s;ylvania and Maryland, and for their be|ing brought to Brun&s;wic, that they may be ready to be exchanged for an equal number of tho&s;e of the &s;ame rank.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, by the re&s;olve of the twenty-&s;ixth ultimo, that the exchange in particularly directed to be made of the of|ficers and &s;oldiers taken on Long-I&s;land. But &s;hould not that follow the exchange of tho&s;e officers and men who have lately returned from Quebec, who&s;e impri&s;onment has been much longer, and who&s;e &s;ervice has not been le&s;s &s;evere, and, in many in&s;tances, conducted with great in|trepidity? I have had many applications &s;ince their arrival, by which they claim a kind of preference as far as their number and the circum&s;tances of their rank will allow,
<PB N="268" REF="029737_0267_0FE249A462103318">
and which I thought it my duty to mention, that I may obtain &s;ome direction upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve by a paragraph of a letter received ye&s;|terday from general Howe, a copy of which you have at&punc; length, that the non-performance of the agreement between captain For&s;ter and general Arnold, by which the latter &s;tipulated for the return of an equal number of officers and pri&s;oners in our hands for tho&s;e delivered him, is con&s;ider|ed in an unfavourable light, and entirely imputed to me, as having the chief command of the armies of the States, and a controlling power over general Arnold. The point|ed manner in which Mr. Howe is plea&s;ed to expre&s;s him|&s;elf could not per&s;onally affect me, &s;uppo&s;ing there had been no good grounds for the treaty not being ratified, having been nothing more than an in&s;trument of conveying to him the re&s;olutions formed upon the &s;ubject. * * *</P>
<P>However, I would beg leave to ob&s;erve, from the letters from the ho&s;tages,&mdash;from what has been reported by others re&s;pecting captain For&s;ter's having u&s;ed his endeavours to re&s;train the &s;avages from exerci&s;ing their wonted barbarities, though in &s;ome in&s;tances they did,&mdash;his purcha&s;ing &s;ome of the pri&s;oners for a pretty con&s;iderable premium,&mdash;but, above all, from the delicate nature of &s;uch treaties, and be|cau&s;e the non-ob&s;ervance of them mu&s;t damp the &s;pirits of the officers who make them, and add affliction to the mi&s;|fortunes of tho&s;e whom nece&s;&s;ity and the nature of the ca&s;e force into captivity to give them a &s;anction by a long and irk&s;ome confinement,&mdash;for the&s;e rea&s;ons and many more that will readily occur, I could wi&s;h Congre&s;s to recon&s;id|er the matter, and to carry it into execution.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible the wrong was originally in their employ|ing &s;avages, and that whatever cruelties were committed by them &s;hould be e&s;teemed their own acts: yet perhaps, in point of policy, it may not be improper to overlook the&s;e infractions on their part, and to pur&s;ue that mode which will be the mo&s;t likely to render the hard&s;hips in|cident to war mo&s;t tolerable, and the greate&s;t benefits to the State.</P>
<P>I have ventured to &s;ay thus much upon the &s;ubject from a regard to the &s;ervice, and becau&s;e &s;uch gentlemen of the
<PB N="269" REF="029737_0268_0FE249FB660BF1C8">
army as I have heard mention it &s;eem to wi&s;h the treaty had been ratified rather than di&s;allowed.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed is a li&s;t of vacancies in the third regiment of Virginia troops, in part occa&s;ioned by the death of major Leitch who died of his wounds on Tue&s;day morning,&mdash;and of the gentlemen who &s;tand next in regimental order, and who are recommended to &s;ucceed to them. You will ob&s;erve that captain John Fitzgerald is &s;aid to be appoint|ed to the duty of major. This I have done in order, be|ing the olde&s;t captain in the regiment, and, I believe, an offi|cer of unexceptionable merit, and as it was highly nece&s;&s;ary at this time to have the corps as well and fully officered as po&s;&s;ible. There is al&s;o a vacancy in the fir&s;t continental battalion by the promotion of lieutenant Clarke to a major|ity in the flying camp, to which colonel Hand has recom|mended William Patten to &s;ucceed, as you will perceive by his letter inclo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I have taken the liberty to tran&s;mit a plan for e&s;tabli&s;h|ing a corps of engineers, artificers, &amp;c. &s;ketched out by colonel Putnam, and which is propo&s;ed for the con&s;idera|tion of Congre&s;s. How far they may incline to adopt it, or whether they may choo&s;e to proceed upon &s;uch an ex|ten&s;ive &s;cale, they will be plea&s;ed to determine. However, I conceive it a matter well worthy of their con&s;ideration, being convinced from experience, and from the rea&s;ons &s;ugge&s;ted by colonel Putnam who has acted with great dil|igence and reputation in the bu&s;ine&s;s, that &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;ort is highly nece&s;&s;ary, and will be productive of the mo&s;t beneficial con&s;equences.</P>
<P>If the propo&s;ition is approved by Congre&s;s, I am inform|ed by good authority that there is a gentleman in Virginia, in the colony &s;ervice, John Stadler, e&s;quire, a native of Germany, who&s;e abilities in this way are by no means in|con&s;iderable. I am told he was an engineer in the army under general Stanwix, and is reputed to be of &s;kill and ingenuity in the profe&s;&s;ion. In this capacity I do not know him my&s;elf, but am intimately acquainted with him in his private character, as a man of under&s;tanding and of good behaviour. I would &s;ubmit his merit to the inquiry of Congre&s;s; and if he &s;hould an&s;wer the report I have
<PB N="270" REF="029737_0269_0FE249A5E58AFA28">
had of him, I make no doubt but he will be &s;uitably pro|vided for.</P>
<P>The convention of this State have lately &s;eized and had apprai&s;ed two new &s;hips, valued at &s;ix thou&s;and two hun|dred and twenty-nine pounds York currency, which they have &s;ent down for the purpo&s;e of &s;inking, and ob&s;tructing the channel oppo&s;ite Mount-Wa&s;hington. The price being high, and the opinions various as to the nece&s;&s;ity of the mea&s;ure, &s;ome conceiving the ob&s;truction nearly &s;ufficient already, and others that they would render it &s;ecure, I would wi&s;h to have the direction of Congre&s;s upon the &s;ub|ject by the earlie&s;t opportunity, thinking my&s;elf, that, if the enemy &s;hould attempt to come up, they &s;hould be u&s;ed, &s;ooner than to hazard their pa&s;&s;ing. I mu&s;t be governed by circum&s;tances, yet hope for their &s;entiments before any thing is nece&s;&s;ary to be done.</P>
<P>Sundry di&s;putes having ari&s;en of late between officers of different regiments and of the &s;ame rank, re&s;pecting the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to &s;uch vacancies as happen from death or other cau&s;es,&mdash;&s;ome &s;ugge&s;ting that it &s;hould be in a co|lonial line and governed by the priority of their commi&s;&s;ions; others, that it &s;hould be regimentally,&mdash;and there being an in&s;tance now before me, between the officers of the Vir|ginia regiments, occa&s;ioned by the death of major Leitch; it has become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that Congre&s;s &s;hould determine the mode by which promotions are to be regu|lated,&mdash;whether colonially and by priority of commi&s;&s;ions, or regimentally, re&s;erving a right out of the general rule they adopt, to reward for particular merit, or of withhold|ing from office &s;uch as may not be worthy to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>I have only propo&s;ed two modes for their con&s;ideration, being &s;atisfied that promotions through the line (as they are called) can never take place without producing di&s;cord, jealou&s;y, di&s;tru&s;t, and the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences. In &s;ome of my letters upon the &s;ubject of promotions, and one which I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing to the board of war on the thirtieth ultimo, I advi&s;ed that the mode &s;hould be rather practi&s;ed than re&s;olved on: but I am fully con|vinced now of the nece&s;&s;ity there is of &s;ettling it in one of the two ways I have taken the liberty to point out, and under the re&s;trictions I have mentioned; or the di&s;putes

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour of tran&s;mitting to you a copy of a letter from the comte D'Emery, governor-gen|eral of the French part of St. Domingo, which I received ye&s;terday, and al&s;o my an&s;wer, which I have inclo&s;ed and left open for the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, wi&s;hing that it may be &s;ealed if they approve of the &s;ieur De Chambea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">'s relea&s;ement, which I think may be attended with many valuable con&s;equences. If Congre&s;s concur in &s;entiment with me, they will be plea&s;ed to give direction for his pa&s;&s;age by the fir&s;t opportunity to the French i&s;lands: if they do not, I &s;hall be obliged by your returning my letter.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o the plea&s;ure of inclo&s;ing a copy of a letter from mon&s;ieur P. Pennel, which came to hand la&s;t night, and which contains intelligence of an agreeable and inter|e&s;ting nature, for which I beg leave to refer you to the copy. The polite manner in which mon&s;ieur Pennel has reque&s;ted to be one of my aides-de-camp demands my acknowledgments. As the appointment will not be at|tended with any expen&s;e, and will &s;hew a proper regard for his complai&s;ance and the attachment he is plea&s;ed to expre&s;s for the &s;ervice of the American States, I &s;hall take the liberty of complying with his requi&s;ition, and tran&s;mit him a brevet commi&s;&s;ion, provided the &s;ame &s;hall be agree|able to Congre&s;s. Their &s;entiments upon this &s;ubject you will be kind enough to favour me with by the fir&s;t opportunity. The inclo&s;ed letter for the &s;ieur De Chambeau you will plea&s;e to forward to him (if he is to be enlarged) after clo&s;ing it.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I mu&s;t take the liberty to ob&s;erve that I am under no &s;mall difficulties on account of the French gentlemen that are here in con&s;equence of the commi&s;&s;ions they have received,&mdash;having no means to employ them, or to afford them an opportunity of ren|dering that &s;ervice they them&s;elves wi&s;h to give, or which
<PB N="272" REF="029737_0271_0FE249A76B2BBE18">
perhaps is expected by the public. Their want of our language is an objection to their being joined to any of the regiments here at this time, were there vacancies, and not other ob&s;tacles. The&s;e con&s;iderations induce me to wi&s;h that Congre&s;s would adopt and point out &s;ome par|ticular mode to be ob&s;erved re&s;pecting them. What it &s;hould be, they will be be&s;t able to determine. But to me it appears that their being here now can be attended with no valuable con&s;equences, and that, as the power of appointing officers for the new army is ve&s;ted in the con|ventions, &amp;c. of the &s;everal States, it will be nece&s;&s;ary for Congre&s;s to direct them to be provided for in the regiments to be rai&s;ed, according to the ranks they would wi&s;h them to bear&mdash;(or I am convinced they will never be taken in, let their merit be what it may;)&mdash;or to form them into a di&s;tinct corps which may be increa&s;ed in time. They &s;eem to be genteel, &s;en&s;ible men; and I have no doubt of their making good officers as &s;oon as they can learn as much of our language as to make them&s;elves well under|&s;tood: but, unle&s;s Congre&s;s interfere by their particular direction to the States, they will never be incorporated in any of the regiments to be rai&s;ed: and, without they are, they will be entirely at a lo&s;s, and in the mo&s;t irk&s;ome &s;ituation, for &s;omething to do, as they now are.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honour of writing you ye&s;ter|day, I have been favoured with a letter from the honour|able council of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, covering one from Richard Derby, e&s;quire, a copy of which is herewith tran&s;mitted, as it contains intelligence of an important and intere&s;ting nature.</P>
<P>As an exchange of pri&s;oners is about to take place, I am induced, from a que&s;tion &s;tated in a letter I received from governor Trumbull this morning, to a&s;k the opinion of Congre&s;s, in what manner the States that have had the care of them are to be reimbur&s;ed the expen&s;es incurred on their account. My want of information in this in&s;tance,
<PB N="273" REF="029737_0272_0FE249FE6EA8CF18">
or whether any account is to be &s;ent in with the pri&s;oners, would not allow me to give him an an&s;wer, as nothing that I recollect has ever been &s;aid upon the &s;ubject. He al&s;o mentions another matter, viz. whether &s;uch privates as are mechanics, and others who may de&s;ire to remain with us, &s;hould be obliged to return. In re&s;pect to the latter, I conceive there can be no doubt of our being under a nece&s;&s;ity of returning the whole, a propo&s;ition having been made on our part for a general exchange, and that agreed to: be&s;ides, the balance of pri&s;oners is greatly again&s;t us; and I am informed it was particularly &s;tipulated by gen|eral Montgomery, that all tho&s;e that were taken in Canada &s;hould be exchanged whenever a cartel was &s;ettled for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the &s;everal committees having the care of them &s;hould be in&s;tructed to make the mo&s;t exact returns of the whole, however wil|ling a part &s;hould be to continue with us. At the &s;ame time I &s;hould think, it not improper to inform them of the rea&s;ons leading to the mea&s;ure, and that they &s;hould be in|vited to e&s;cape afterwards, which, in all probability, they may effect without much difficulty if they are attached to us, extending their influence to many more, and bringing them away al&s;o.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of our affairs and the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment of the army requiring our mo&s;t vigorous exertions to en|gage a new one, I pre&s;ume it will be nece&s;&s;ary to furni&s;h the pay-ma&s;ter-general as early as po&s;&s;ible with money to pay the bounty, lately re&s;olved on, to &s;uch men as will enli&s;t. Prompt pay perhaps may have a happy effect, and induce the continuance of &s;ome who are here: but, with|out it, I am certain that nothing can be done; nor have we time to lo&s;e in making the experiment. But then it may be a&s;ked, who is to recruit? or who can con&s;ider them&s;elves as officers for that purpo&s;e, till the conventions of the different States have made the appointments?</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday afternoon the exchange between lord Stirling and governor Browne was carried into execution; and his lord&s;hip is now here. He confirms the intelligence men|tioned by captain Souther, about the tran&s;ports he met, by the arrival of the Daphne man-of-war (a twenty-gun &s;hip)
<PB N="274" REF="029737_0273_0FE249A8F8287700">
a few days ago, with twelve &s;hips under her convoy, having light-hor&s;e on board. They &s;ailed with about twenty in each, and lo&s;t about eighty in their pa&s;&s;age, be&s;ides tho&s;e in the ve&s;&s;el taken by captain Souther. He further adds that he had heard it acknowledged more than once, that, in the action of the &s;ixteenth ultimo, the enemy had a hundred men killed,&mdash;about &s;ixty Highlanders of the for|ty-&s;econd regiment, and forty of the light-infantry. This confe&s;&s;ion coming from them&s;elves, we may rea&s;onably conclude, did not exaggerate the number. * * *</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 9. About eight o'clock this morning, two &s;hips, of forty-four guns each (&s;uppo&s;ed to be the Roebuck and Phenix,) and a frigate of twenty guns, with three or four tenders, got under way from about Bloomingdale where they had been lying &s;ome time, and &s;tood with an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;y &s;outherly breeze towards our chevaux-de-fri&s;e, which we hoped would have inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">epted their pa&s;&s;age while our batteries played upon them: but, to our &s;urpri&s;e and mor|tification, they ran through without the lea&s;t difficulty, and without receiving any apparent damage from our forts, though they kept up a heavy fire from both &s;ides of the river. Their de&s;tination or views cannot be known with certainty: but mo&s;t probably they are &s;ent to &s;top the navigation, and cut off the &s;upplies of boards, &amp;c. which we &s;hould have received, and of which we are in great need. They are &s;tanding up, and I have di&s;patched an expre&s;s to the convention of this State, that notice may be immediately communicated to general Clinton at the Highland fortifications, to put him on his guard in ca&s;e they &s;hould have any de&s;igns again&s;t them, and that pre|cautions may be taken to prevent the craft belonging to the river falling into their hands.</P>

<P>I BEG leave to inform you, that, &s;ince my letter of the eighth and ninth in&s;tant which I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you, nothing of importance has occurred, except that the &s;hips of war which I then mentioned, in their

pa&s;&s;age up the river, took a &s;loop that was at anchor off the mouth of Spitendevil, and two of our row-gallies which they out-&s;ailed. The crews, finding that they could not prevent them falling into the enemy's hands, ran them near the &s;hore, and effected their own e&s;cape. From the intel|ligence I have received, the &s;hips are now lying at Tarry-town, without having landed any men (which &s;eemed to be apprehended by &s;ome) or attempted any thing el&s;e. Their principal views, in all probability, are, to interrupt our navigation, and to receive &s;uch di&s;affected per&s;ons as incline to take part again&s;t us. The former they will ef|fect beyond all que&s;tion; and I fear that their expectations re&s;pecting the latter will be but too fully an&s;wered.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 12. The inclo&s;ed copy of a letter received la&s;t night from the convention of this State will &s;hew you the apprehen&s;ions they are under on account of the di&s;af|fected among them. I have ordered up a part of the mi|litia from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts under general Lincoln, to pre|vent, if po&s;&s;ible, the con&s;equences which they &s;ugge&s;t may happen, and which there is rea&s;on to believe the con&s;pira|tors have in contemplation. I am per&s;uaded that they are upon the eve of breaking out, and that they will leave nothing une&s;&s;ayed that will di&s;tre&s;s us and favour the de&s;igns of the enemy, as &s;oon as their &s;chemes are ripe for it.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 13. Ye&s;terday the enemy landed at Frog's-Point, about nine miles from hence, further up the Sound. Their number we cannot a&s;certain, as they have not ad|vanced from the point,&mdash;which is a kind of i&s;land,&mdash;but the water that &s;urrounds it is fordable at low tide. I have ordered works to be thrown up at the pa&s;&s;es from the point to the main. From the great number of &s;loops, &s;chooners, and nine &s;hips, that went up the Sound in the evening, full of men, and from the information of two de&s;erters who came over la&s;t night, I have rea&s;on to believe that the greate&s;t part of their army has moved upwards or is about to do it, pur&s;uing their original plan of getting in our rear, and cutting off our communication with the country.</P>
<P>The grounds from Frog's-Point are &s;trong and defen&s;i|ble, being full of &s;tone fences, both along the road and acro&s;s the adjacent fields, which will render it difficult for

<P>HIS excellency having gone this morning to vi&s;it our po&s;ts beyond King&s;bridge and the &s;everal pa&s;&s;es leading from Frog's-Point and the necks adjacent, I have the honour to inform you by his command, that no intere&s;ting event has taken place &s;ince his letter by ye&s;terday's po&s;t.</P>

<P>There are now in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;everal per&s;ons, inhabit|ants of this State, who had engaged to join the enemy, and were intercepted in going to them.

As the affairs of this government are in a precarious &s;ituation, and &s;uch as, the convention them|&s;elves &s;eem to think, forbid their interpo&s;ition farther than taking mea&s;ures to apprehend them, his excellency would wi&s;h to obtain the &s;entiments of Congre&s;s, and their direc|tion upon a &s;ubject &s;o extremely critical and delicate, and

Declin|ing an attack upon our front, they have drawn the main body of their army to Frog's-Point, with a de&s;ign of hem|ming us in, and drawing a line in our rear. To prevent the con&s;equences which would but too probably follow the execution of their &s;cheme, the general officers determined ye&s;terday that our forces mu&s;t be taken from hence, and extended towards Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Che&s;ter, &s;o as to out|flank them. General Lee, who arrived on Monday, has &s;trongly urged the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of the mea&s;ure. It is propo&s;ed to leave a garri&s;on at Fort-Wa&s;hington, and to maintain it if po&s;&s;ible, in order to pre&s;erve the communica|tion with the Jer&s;eys.

<P>The enemy are pur&s;uing with great indu&s;try their plan of penetrating the country from the Sound, and of forming a line in our rear. They are now extended from Frog's-Point to New-Rochelle, from whence it is generally con|jectured they mean to take their route by way of the White-Plains, and from thence to draw a line to the North-river. We on our part have drawn our whole force, ex|cept the regiments intended to garri&s;on Fort-Wa&s;hington, from the i&s;land of New-York, and have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed our&s;elves of the heights, pa&s;&s;es, and advantageous grounds, between

<P>THE whole of our army is now here and on the neighbouring heights, except the troops left at Mount-Wa&s;h|ington and King&s;bridge, (about fourteen hundred at the former, and &s;ix hundred at the latter) and general Lee's divi&s;ion which now forms the rear, and which is on their march. Our removal, and that of the &s;tores, have been attended with a great deal of trouble, owing to the &s;carcity and difficulty of procuring waggons. However, they are nearly effected, and without any lo&s;s. The general officers are now reconnoitring the &s;everal pa&s;&s;es leading from the enemy, that the mo&s;t important may be immediately &s;ecur|ed. The &s;ituation of their army remains nearly the &s;ame as when I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you on the twenty-fir&s;t in&s;tant. It differs in nothing unle&s;s it is that their main body is more collected about New-Rochelle. A few of their troops are extended as far as Momarioneck.</P>
<P>On Monday night a detachment of our men, under the command of colonel Hazlet, was &s;ent out to &s;urpri&s;e and cut off major Rogers, if po&s;&s;ible, with his regiment which was po&s;ted there. By &s;ome accident or other the expedi|tion did not &s;ucceed &s;o well as I could have wi&s;hed. However, our advanced party, led on by major Greene of
<PB N="281" REF="029737_0280_0FE24A0C79293590">
the fir&s;t Virginia regiment, fell in with their out-guard, and brought off thirty-&s;ix pri&s;oners, &s;ixty mu&s;kets, and &s;ome blankets. The number killed is not certainly known: but it is reported by an officer who was there, that he counted about twenty-five. Our lo&s;s, two killed, and ten or twelve wounded; among the latter, major Greene, who&s;e recov|ery is very doubtful.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day there was al&s;o a &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;h between a party of colonel Hand's riflemen,&mdash;about two hundred and forty,&mdash;and nearly the &s;ame number of He&s;&s;ian cha&s;|&s;eurs, in which the latter were put to the route. Our men buried ten of them on the field, and took two pri&s;oners, one badly wounded. We &s;u&s;tained no other lo&s;s than having one lad wounded, &s;uppo&s;ed mortally.</P>
<P>The &s;hips of war that are in the North-river fell down, ye&s;terday morning or the evening before, to Dobbs's ferry, to prevent our bringing &s;tores from below by water, and the removal of tho&s;e that are landed there. As &s;oon as the waggons, employed in bringing the baggage and &s;tores of general Lee's divi&s;ion, are di&s;engaged, they will be immediately &s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e already there to remove them.</P>
<P>On Saturday night we had the misfortune to lo&s;e one of the new &s;hips intended to be &s;unk for ob&s;tructing the chan|nel. She parted her cables in a &s;evere &s;quall, when prop|erly balla&s;ted, and bilged as &s;oon as &s;he &s;truck the &s;hore. The other &s;hip was &s;unk well; and ye&s;terday morning two brigs, both ready, were &s;ent down for the &s;ame pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>About two o'clock this afternoon, intelligence was brought to Head-Quarters that three or four detachments of the enemy were on their march, and had advanced within about four miles of this place. It has been fully confirm|ed &s;ince by a variety of per&s;ons who have been out to rec|onnoitre. Their number cannot be a&s;certained: but it is generally conjectured that the detachments are or will be &s;ucceeded by as many columns compo&s;ing their main body. Our drums have beat to arms, and the men are ordered to their &s;everal po&s;ts. Mo&s;t probably &s;ome important event is upon the eve of taking place: I hope it will be victory in favour of our arms. General Lee, with his divi&s;ion, has not got up; but I hear he is on his march.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="029737_0281_0FE249B8BAB338C0">
Experiment having proved it difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to prevent the enemy from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the navigation of the North-river, and rendering the communication and inter|cour&s;e between the States divided by it extremely hazard|ous and precarious by means of their &s;hips of war, it has become a matter of important con&s;ideration how to remedy the evil, and to guard again&s;t the con&s;equences which may re&s;ult from it. I am charged by his excellency to men|tion it to Congre&s;s as a matter that has employed much of his thought, and that &s;eems worthy of their mo&s;t &s;erious attention. He has communicated it to &s;everal of the gen|eral and other officers, and to many gentlemen of &s;en&s;e and di&s;cernment, who all agree with him, not only upon the propriety but the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity that two di&s;tinct armies &s;hould be formed,&mdash;one to act particularly in the States which lie on the ea&s;t, the other in tho&s;e that are on the &s;outh of the river;&mdash;the whole however to be rai&s;ed on a general plan, and not to be confined to any particular place by the terms of enli&s;tment. The&s;e matters,&mdash;the apparent difficulty and perhaps impracticability of &s;uccours being thrown acro&s;s the river while the enemy can command it,&mdash;have induced his excellency to &s;ubmit the mea&s;ure to their con&s;ideration, not knowing how their operations may be directed, and fore&s;eeing that innumerable evils may ari&s;e if a re&s;pectable force is not appointed to oppo&s;e their arms where&s;oever they are carried.</P>

<P>After gaining the hill, (upon which they are entrenching) and leaving a &s;ufficient number of men and artillery to prevent our repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it, they proceeded to advance by our left; and, as far as I can di&s;cover, their po&s;ts or en|campments now form nearly a &s;emicircle.

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you on the twenty-ninth in&s;tant, no event of importance has occurred. The enemy are throwing up &s;ome lines and redoubts in our front, with a view of cannonading as &s;oon as they are ready; and at the &s;ame time are extending their wings far|ther by our right and left. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that one of their objects is to advance a part of their troops, and &s;eize on the bridge over Cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">on river, that the communication may be cut off with the upper country. To prevent this, a part of our force is detached, with orders to proceed with the utmo&s;t expedition, and to &s;ecure the pa&s;s, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>We are trying to remove, to guard again&s;t their de&s;igns, but are greatly impeded by rea&s;on of the &s;carcity of wag|gons in proportion to our baggage and &s;tores. Every ex|ertion has been employed to obtain a &s;ufficiency; but they cannot be had in this part of the country. The quarter-ma&s;ter has &s;ent to Connecticut to get a &s;upply, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>

Our army is decrea&s;ing fa&s;t. Several gentlemen, who have come to camp within a few days, have ob&s;erved large numbers of militia returning home on the different roads: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or are any mea&s;ures taken as yet to rai&s;e the new army, no commi&s;&s;ions having come from the States to appoint or &s;ignify the nomination of their officers.

<P>I AM directed by his excellency to acknowledge his receipt of your favour of the twenty-eighth ultimo which came to hand ye&s;terday evening, and to tran&s;mit you a copy of the letter. I had the honour of writing you by the Bo&s;ton expre&s;s by his command. Had the expre&s;s been charged with no other letter, the lo&s;s would not have been attended with any material injury to us or advantage to the enemy, provided it &s;hould come to their hands: but there were others from his excellency, of a very intere&s;t|ing nature, the mi&s;carriage of which gives him much con|cern. As the bundle was taken away in &s;o &s;udden and &s;ecret a manner, I fear there is but little hope of recover|ing it,&mdash;being done mo&s;t probably for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of furni&s;hing the enemy with intelligence, and a &s;tate of our army. Be&s;ides his excellency's letters, the mo&s;t ma|terial of which was to Mr. Rutledge, there were five or &s;ix more from the gentlemen of his family.</P>
<P>My letters of the twenty-ninth and of ye&s;terday, which I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you, will give a pretty full account of our &s;ituation, and of every matter re&s;pecting this army antecedent to this date. I only omitted to mention that we have taken thirteen of the Waldeckers, and that, for &s;everal days pa&s;t, our &s;couting parties have brought in one, two, or three pri&s;oners. In addition to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e, we have every day a de&s;erter or two.</P>

There is a good deal of flour on the Jer&s;ey &s;ide: but there is no other way to get it, but by carting and ferrying it over to Peek&s;kill.

<P>BY command of his excellency, I have the honour to acknowledge his receipt of your favour of the twenty-fourth ultimo, and to inform you that he e&s;teems the plan you propo&s;e to lay before Congre&s;s, for preventing more rations being drawn than may be due, well calculated to an&s;wer the end. That re&s;pecting the &s;ick &s;eems to him not entirely perfect. The captains or commanders of companies are prohibited from drawing pay for &s;uch &s;ick as may be di&s;charged from the ho&s;pitals as unfit for &s;ervice. If, during their &s;tay, and before it can be known whether their ca&s;e will or will not admit of their return, it &s;hould become nece&s;&s;ary to make up a regimental pay-ab&s;tract, in what manner are the officers to make up their rolls? are they to include the &s;ick, or not?</P>
<P>As this is a ca&s;e which may and mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity fre|quently happen, it appears to his excellency that the intend|ed regulations &s;hould be more general, and re&s;train the officers from including in their pay-ab&s;tracts or rolls all the &s;ick they &s;end to the ho&s;pitals, and the pay due them previ|ous to their going. In &s;uch ca&s;e, tho&s;e who are di&s;charged as unfit for &s;ervice may receive their pay as intended; and tho&s;e who return to duty can obtain what was due to them when the regiment was paid, by applying to the payma&s;ter with the officer and &s;urgeon's certificates, or be included in a &s;ub&s;equent ab&s;tract. The inconveniences and abu&s;es which are de&s;igned to be remedied by the&s;e regulations, his excellency does not apprehend to ari&s;e &s;o much from nece&s;&s;ity (as incident to the nature of armies) as from the imperfect in&s;titution of the pre&s;ent, and the great mix|ture and diver&s;ity of troops compo&s;ing it, and al&s;o from the inattention of the officers. * * *</P>
<P>The defencele&s;s &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, as communicated by the committee of &s;afety to your honourable body, is a matter of much concern to his excellency, which is not a little aggravated by the part too many &s;eem ready to take in favour of the enemy. He tru&s;ts, however, the defec|tion will be too incon&s;iderable to threaten any alarming con&s;equences.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="029737_0286_0FE24A1AA16193F8">
Before the receipt of your letter, his excellency had wrote to the commanding officer of the Virginia regiments at Trenton, directing him to march them forward towards general Greene's po&s;t, and there remain under his com|mand till further orders, unle&s;s &s;pecial in&s;tructions had been or &s;hould be given to the contrary by Congre&s;s, or for their particular de&s;tination.</P>
<P>Agreeable to your reque&s;t, his excellency has con&s;ulted with general Lee upon the be&s;t mode for employing the French gentlemen, and making them &s;erviceable. The re&s;ult is that they &s;hould be appointed to regiments by Congre&s;s according to the ranks they have been plea&s;ed to give them, and with the &s;ame pay as is allowed other offi|cers in &s;uch ca&s;es. Their want of our language is rather an objection: but it is hoped they will attain a &s;ufficient knowledge of it, ere it be long, to be of great &s;ervice; and that, in the interim, their advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in di|recting of works may be of u&s;e where they may be &s;ta|tioned.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour to inform you that on ye&s;ter|day morning the enemy made a &s;udden and unexpected movement from the &s;everal po&s;ts they had taken in our front. They broke up their whole encampments the pre|ceding night, and have advanced towards King&s;bridge and the North-river. The de&s;ign of this manoeuvre is a mat|ter of much conjecture and &s;peculation, and cannot be ac|counted for with any degree of certainty. The grounds we had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of were &s;trong and advantageous, and &s;uch as they could not have gained without much lo&s;s of blood in ca&s;e an attempt had been made. I had taken every po&s;&s;ible precaution to prevent their outflanking us;&mdash;which may have led to the pre&s;ent mea&s;ure. They may &s;till have in view their original plan, and, by a &s;udden wheel, try to accompli&s;h it. Detachments are con&s;tantly out to ob&s;erve their motions, and to hara&s;s them as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this movement I called a council of general officers to-day, to con&s;ult of &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hould
<PB N="288" REF="029737_0287_0FE249C41486AB50">
be adopted in ca&s;e they pur&s;ued their retreat to New-York; the re&s;ult of which is herewith tran&s;mitted. In re&s;pect to my&s;elf, I cannot indulge an idea that general Howe, &s;up|po&s;ing he is going to New-York, means to clo&s;e the cam|paign, and to &s;it down without attempting &s;omething more. I think it highly probable, and almo&s;t certain, that he will make a de&s;cent with a part of his troops into Jer&s;ey: and, as &s;oon as I am &s;atisfied that the pre&s;ent manoeuvre is real and not a feint, I &s;hall u&s;e every means in my power to forward a part of our force to counteract his de&s;igns: nor &s;hall I be di&s;appointed if he &s;ends a detachment to the &s;outhward for the purpo&s;e of making a winter campaign.</P>
<P>From the information I have received, there is now a number of tran&s;ports at Red-Hook, with about three thou&s;and troops on board. Their de&s;tination, as given out, is to Rhode-I&s;land: but this &s;eems altogether im|probable for various rea&s;ons; among others, the &s;ea&s;on is much again&s;t it. In the &s;outhern States they will find it milder, and much more favourable for their purpo&s;es. I &s;hall take the liberty of mentioning that it may not be im|proper to &s;ugge&s;t the probability of &s;uch a mea&s;ure to the a&s;&s;emblies and conventions in tho&s;e States, that they may be on their guard,&mdash;and the propriety of their e&s;tabli&s;hing and laying up magazines of provi&s;ions and other nece&s;&s;a|ries in &s;uitable places. This is a matter of exceeding im|portance, and what cannot be too much attended to.</P>
<P>From the approaching di&s;&s;oluti&oacute;n of the army, and the departure of the new levies which is on the eve of taking place, and the little pro&s;pect of levying a new one in time, I have wrote to the ea&s;tern States by the unanimous ad|vice of the general officers, to forward &s;upplies of militia in the room of tho&s;e that are now here, and who, it is fear|ed, will not be prevailed on to &s;tay any longer than the time they are engaged for. The propriety of this appli|cation I tru&s;t will appear, when it is known that not a &s;ingle officer is yet commi&s;&s;ioned to recruit, and when it is con&s;idered how e&s;&s;ential it is to keep up &s;ome &s;hew of force and &s;hadow of an army.</P>
<P>I expect the enemy will bend their force again&s;t Fort-Wa&s;hington, and inve&s;t it immediately. From &s;ome ad|vices, it is an object that will attract their earlie&s;t attention.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="029737_0288_0FE24A1C257157A8">
I am happy to inform you, that, in the engagement on Monday fe'nnight, I have rea&s;on to believe our lo&s;s was by no means &s;o con&s;iderable as was conjectured at fir&s;t. By &s;ome de&s;erters and pri&s;oners we are told, that of the enemy was tolerably great: &s;ome accounts make it about four hundred in killed and wounded: all agree that among the former there was a colonel Carr of the thirty-fifth regi|ment.</P>
<P>The force that will be &s;ent to Jer&s;ey after I am &s;atisfied of Mr. Howe's retreat, in addition to tho&s;e now there, ac|cording to my pre&s;ent opinion, will make it nece&s;&s;ary for me to go with them, to put things in a proper channel, and &s;uch a way of defence as &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t probable to check the progre&s;s of the enemy, in ca&s;e they &s;hould at|tempt a de&s;cent there, or a move toward Philadelphia.</P>

<P>I HAVE only time to acknowledge the honour of your letter of the fifth in&s;tant, and its &s;everal inclo&s;ures, and to inform you, that, agreeable to the re&s;olves of Con|gre&s;s, I &s;hall u&s;e every mea&s;ure in my power that the moving and pre&s;ent confu&s;ed &s;tate of the army will admit of, to appoint officers for recruiting.</P>
<P>You will have been advi&s;ed, before this, of the arrival of commi&s;&s;ioners from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. Others have come from Connecticut: but, from the pre&s;ent appearance of things, we &s;eem but little if any nearer to levying an army. I had anticipated the re&s;olve re&s;pecting the militia, by writing to the ea&s;tern States and to the Jer&s;ey, by the
<PB N="291" REF="029737_0290_0FE24A25DAE9A9E8">
advice of my general officers, and from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the nece&s;&s;ity of getting in a number of men if po&s;&s;ible, to keep up the appearance of an army. How my applica|tions will &s;ucceed, the event mu&s;t determine. I have little or no rea&s;on to expect that the militia now here will remain a day longer than the time they fir&s;t engaged for. I have rec|ommended their &s;tay, and reque&s;ted it in general orders. General Lincoln and the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts commi&s;&s;ioners are u&s;ing their intere&s;t with tho&s;e from that State: but, as far as I can judge, we cannot rely on their &s;taying.</P>
<P>I left White-Plains about eleven o'clock ye&s;terday;&mdash;all peace then. The enemy appeared to be preparing for their expedition to Jer&s;ey according to every information. What their de&s;igns are, or whether their pre&s;ent conduct is not a feint, I cannot determine.</P>
<P>The Maryland and Virginia troops under lord Stirling have cro&s;&s;ed the river, as have part of tho&s;e from the Jer|&s;ey: the remainder are now embarking. The troops, judged nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the &s;everal po&s;ts through the Highlands, have al&s;o got up. I am going to examine the pa&s;&s;es, and direct &s;uch works as may appear nece&s;&s;ary; after which, and making the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition I can of things in this quarter, I intend to proceed to Jer&s;ey, which I expect to do to-morrow.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;emblies of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connecticut, to induce their men more readily to engage in the &s;ervice, have voted an advance pay of twenty &s;hillings per month, in addition to that allowed by Congre&s;s to privates. It may perhaps be the means of their levying the quotas ex|acted from them &s;ooner than they could otherwi&s;e have been rai&s;ed: but I am of opinion, a more fatal and mi&s;|taken policy could not have entered their councils, or one more detrimental to the general cau&s;e. The influence of the vote will become continental, and materially affect the other States in making up their levies. If they could do it, I am certain, when the troops come to act together, that jealou&s;y, impatience and mutiny would nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e. A different pay cannot exi&s;t in the &s;ame army. The rea&s;ons are obvious, and experience has proved their force in the ca&s;e of the ea&s;tern and &s;outhern troops la&s;t &s;pring. Sen&s;ible of this, and of the pernicious con&s;e|quences
<PB N="292" REF="029737_0291_0FE249CE88615320">
that would inevitably re&s;ult from the advance, I have prevented the commi&s;&s;ioners from proceeding or pub|li&s;hing their terms till they could obtain the &s;en&s;e of Con|gre&s;s upon the &s;ubject, and remon&s;trated again&s;t it in a let|ter to governor Trumbull. I am not &s;ingular in opinion: I have the concurrence of all the general officers, of its fatal tendency.</P>

time: to me there appears a probability of it, which &s;eems to be favoured by the advices we have that many tran&s;ports are wooding and watering. General Greene's letter would give you the &s;ub&s;tance of the intelligence brought by Mr. Mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> from Staten-I&s;land in this in&s;tance, which he received before it came to me.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed you have copies of two letters from general Howe, and of my an&s;wer to the fir&s;t of them. The letter alluded to, and returned in his la&s;t, was one from my&s;elf to Mrs. Wa&s;hington, of the twenty-fifth ultimo, from whence I conclude that all the letters which went by the Bo&s;ton expre&s;s have come to his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. You will al&s;o perceive that general Howe has reque&s;ted the return of Peter jack, a &s;ervant to major Stewart, to which I have con&s;ented, as he was not in the military line, and the re|qui&s;ition agreeable to the cu&s;tom of war. This &s;ervant having been &s;ent to Philadelphia with the Waldockers and other pri&s;oners, I mu&s;t reque&s;t the favour of you to have him conveyed to general Greene by the earlie&s;t opportuni|ty, in order that he may be returned to his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I beg leave not only to &s;ugge&s;t but to urge the nece&s;&s;ity of increa&s;ing our field artillery very con&s;iderably. Experience has convinced me, as it has every gentleman of di&s;cernment in this army, that, while we remain &s;o much inferior to the enemy in this in&s;tance, we mu&s;t carry on the war under infinite di&s;advantages, and without the &s;malle&s;t probability of &s;ucce&s;s. It has been peculiarly owing to the &s;ituation of the country where their operations have been conducted, and to the rough and &s;trong grounds we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed our&s;elves of, and over which they had to pa&s;s, that they have not carried their arms, by means of their artillery, to a much greater extent. When the&s;e difficulties cea&s;e by changing the &s;cene of action to a level champaign country, the wor&s;t of con&s;equences are to be apprehended. I would therefore, with the concurrence of all the officers whom I have &s;poken to upon the &s;ubject, &s;ubmit to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s whether immediate mea&s;ures ought not to be taken for procuring a re&s;pectable train.</P>
<P>It is agreed on all hands that each battalion &s;hould be furni&s;hed at lea&s;t with two pieces, and that a &s;maller num|ber
<PB N="294" REF="029737_0293_0FE249D0660F9F30">
than a hundred of three pounds, fifty of &s;ix pounds, and fifty of twelve pounds, &s;hould not be provided, in ad|dition to tho&s;e we now have. Be&s;ides the&s;e, if &s;ome eigh|teen and twenty-four-pounders are ordered, the train will be more &s;erviceable and complete. The whole &s;hould be of bra&s;s, for the mo&s;t obvious rea&s;ons: they will be much more portable, not half &s;o liable to bur&s;t: and, when they do, no damage is occa&s;ioned by it, and they may be ca&s;t over again. The &s;izes before de&s;cribed &s;hould be particu|larly attended to: if they are not, there will be great rea|&s;on to expect mi&s;takes and confu&s;ion in the charges in time of action, as it has frequently happened in the be&s;t regulated armies. The di&s;parity between tho&s;e I have mentioned and &s;uch as are of an intermediate &s;ize is diffi|cult to di&s;cern.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o agreed that a regiment of artilleri&s;ts, with ap|proved and experienced officers, &s;hould be obtained if po&s;|&s;ible, and &s;ome engineers of known reputation and abilities. I am &s;orry to &s;ay, too ready an indulgence has been had to &s;everal appointments in the latter in&s;tance, and that men have been promoted, who &s;eem to me to know but little if any thing of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Perhaps this train, &amp;c. may be looked upon by &s;ome as large and expen&s;ive. True, it will be &s;o: but when it is con&s;idered that the enemy, having effected but little in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent campaign, will u&s;e their utmo&s;t efforts to &s;ubjugate us in the next, every con&s;ideration of that &s;ort &s;hould be di&s;regarded, and every po&s;&s;ible preparation made to fru&s;trate their * * * attempts. How they are to be procured, is to be inquired into. That we cannot provide them among our&s;elves, or more than a very &s;mall proportion, &s;o trifling as not to de&s;erve our notice, is evident. There|fore I would advi&s;e, with all imaginable deference, that, without any abatement of our own internal exertions, ap|plication &s;hould be immediately made to &s;uch powers as can and may be willing to &s;upply them. They cannot be obtained too early, if &s;oon enough: and I am told they may be ea&s;ily had from France and Holland.</P>
<P>Mr. Trumbull the commi&s;&s;ary-general has frequently mentioned to me of late the inadequacy of his pay to his trouble and the great ri&s;k he is &s;ubject to on account of the
<PB N="295" REF="029737_0294_0FE24A28E5DC71A0">
large &s;ums of money which pa&s;s through his hands. He has &s;tated his ca&s;e with a view of laying it before Congre&s;s and obtaining a more adequate compen&s;ation. My &s;entiments upon the &s;ubject are already known: but yet I &s;hall take the liberty to add that I think his complaint to be well founded, and his pay, con&s;idering the important duties and ri&s;ks of his office, by no means &s;ufficient, and that the foot|ing he &s;eems to think it &s;hould be upon, him&s;elf, appears ju&s;t and rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>A propo&s;ition having been made long &s;ince to general Howe and agreed to by him, for an exchange of pri&s;oners in con&s;equence of the re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s to that effect, I &s;hall be extremely happy if you will give directions to the committees and tho&s;e having the charge of pri&s;oners in the &s;everal States &s;outh of Jer&s;ey, to tran&s;mit me proper li&s;ts of the names of all the commi&s;&s;ioned officers, and of their ranks and the corps they belong to; al&s;o the number of non-commi&s;&s;ioned and privates, and their re&s;pective regi|ments. You will perceive by his letter, he &s;uppo&s;es me to have affected &s;ome delay, or to have been unmindful of the propo&s;ition I had made.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e to &s;tay in this neighbourhood a few days, in which time I expect the de&s;igns of the enemy will be more di&s;clo&s;ed, and their incur&s;ions be made in this quarter, or their inve&s;titure of Fort-Wa&s;hington, if they are intended.</P>

<P>HAVING given my promi&s;e to general Howe, on his application, that Peter Jack, a &s;ervant of major Stewart, who was &s;ent to Philadelphia with the Waldeckers and other pri&s;oners, and who has nothing to do in the military line, &s;hould be returned to his ma&s;ter agreeable to the u&s;age of war in &s;uch ca&s;es,&mdash;I mu&s;t take the liberty to reque&s;t the favour of you to have him conveyed to general Greene by the earlie&s;t opportunity, that he may be forwarded to his ma&s;ter in compliance with my promi&s;e.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you la&s;t, an important event has taken place, of which I wi&s;h to give you the earlie&s;t intelligence.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="029737_0296_0FE24A2A68511B20">
The pre&s;ervation of the pa&s;&s;age of the North-river was an object of &s;o much con&s;equence that I thought no pains o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> expen&s;e too great for that purpo&s;e: and therefore, after &s;ending off all the valuable &s;tores except &s;uch as were nece&s;&s;ary for its defence, I determined, agreeable to the ad|vice of mo&s;t of the general officers, to ri&s;k &s;omething to defend the po&s;t on the ea&s;t &s;ide, called Mount-Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>When the army moved up in con&s;equence of general Howe's landing at Frog-point, colonel Magaw was left on that command, with about twelve hundred men, and orders given to defend it to the la&s;t. Afterwards, reflect|ing upon the &s;mallne&s;s of the garri&s;on, and the difficulty of their holding it if general Howe &s;hould fall down upon it with his whole force, I wrote to general Greene who had the command on the Jer&s;ey &s;hore, directing him to govern him&s;elf by circum&s;tances, and to retain or evacuate the po&s;t as he &s;hould think be&s;t, and revoking the ab&s;olute order to colonel Magaw to defend the po&s;t to the la&s;t ex|tremity. General Greene, &s;truck with the importance of the po&s;t, and the di&s;couragement which our evacuation of po&s;ts mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have given, reinforced colonel Magaw with detachments from &s;everal regiments of the flying camp, but chiefly of Penn&s;ylvania, &s;o as to make up the number about two thou&s;and.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation things were ye&s;terday, when general Howe demanded the &s;urrendry of the garri&s;on, to which colonel Magaw returned a &s;pirited refu&s;al. Immediately upon receiving an account of this tran&s;action, I came from Hackin&s;ac to this place, and had partly cro&s;&s;ed the North-river when I met general Putnam and general Greene, who were ju&s;t returning from thence, and informed me that the troops were in high &s;pirits, and would make a good defence: and it being late at night, I returned.</P>
<P>Early this morning colonel Magaw po&s;ted his troops partly in the lines thrown up by our army on our fir&s;t com|ing thither from New-York, and partly on a commanding hill lying north of Mount-Wa&s;hington,&mdash;the lines being all to the &s;outhward. In this po&s;ition the attack began about ten o'clock, which our troops &s;tood, and returned the fire in &s;uch a manner as gave me great hopes the enemy was entirely repul&s;ed. But at this time a body of troops cro&s;&s;|ed
<PB N="298" REF="029737_0297_0FE249D36FA382C8">
Haerlem-river in boats, and landed in&s;ide of the &s;econd lines, our troops being then engaged in the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Colonel Cadwallader, who commanded in the lines, &s;ent off a detachment to oppo&s;e them: but they, being over-powered by numbers, gave way; upon which, colonel Cad|wallader ordered his troops to retreat in order to gain the &s;ort It was done with much confu&s;ion; and the enemy cro&s;&s;ing over came in upon them in &s;uch a manner, that a number of them &s;urrendered.</P>
<P>At this time the He&s;&s;ians advanced on the north &s;ide of the fort in very large bodies. They were received by the troops po&s;ted there, with proper &s;pirit, and kept back a con&s;iderable time; but at length they were al&s;o obliged to &s;ubmit to a &s;uperiority of numbers, and retire under the cannon of the fort.</P>
<P>The enemy, having advanced thus far, halted; and im|mediately a flag went in, with a repetition of the demand of the fortre&s;s, as I &s;uppo&s;e. At this time I &s;ent a billet to colonel Magaw, directing him to hold out, and I would endeavour this evening to bring off the garri&s;on, if the for|tre&s;s could not be maintained, as I did not expect it could, the enemy being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the adjacent ground. But, before this reached him, he had entered too far into a treaty to retract: after which, colonel Cadwallader told another me&s;&s;enger who went over, that they had been able to obtain no other terms than to &s;urrender as pri&s;oners of war. In this &s;ituation matters now &s;tand. I have &s;topped general Beall's and general Heard's brigades, to pre&s;erve the po&s;t and &s;tores here; which, with the other troops, I hope we &s;hall be able to effect.</P>
<P>I do not yet know the numbers killed or wounded on either &s;ide: but, from the heavine&s;s and continuance of the fire in &s;ome places, I imagine there mu&s;t have been con&s;id|erable execution.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of &s;uch a number of officers and men, many of whom have been trained with more than common at|tention, will, I fear, be &s;everely felt; but, when that of the arms and accoutrements is added, much more &s;o; and mu&s;t be a further incentive to procure as con&s;iderable a &s;upply as po&s;&s;ible for the new troops, as &s;oon as it can be done.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not been yet able to obtain a particular account of the unhappy affair of the &s;ixteenth, nor of the terms on which the garri&s;on &s;urrendered. The intelli|gence that has come to hand is not &s;o full and accurate as I could wi&s;h. One of the artillery, who&s;e information is mo&s;t direct, and who e&s;caped on Sunday night, &s;ays the enemy's lo&s;s was very con&s;iderable, e&s;pecially in the attack made above the fort by the divi&s;ion of He&s;&s;ians that march|ed from King&s;bridge, and where lieutenant-colonel Raw|lins, of the late colonel Stephen&s;on's regiment, was po&s;ted.</P>
<P>They burned ye&s;terday one or two hou&s;es on the heights, and contiguous to the fort, and appeared, by advices from general Greene, to be moving in the evening their main body down towards the city. Whether they will clo&s;e the campaign without attempting &s;omething more, or make an incur&s;ion into Jer&s;ey, mu&s;t be determined by the events them&s;elves.</P>
<P>As Fort-Lee was always con&s;idered as only nece&s;&s;ary in conjunction with that on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, to pre&s;erve the communication acro&s;s, and to prevent the ene|my from a free navigation, it has become of no importance by the lo&s;s of the other, or not &s;o material as to employ a force for its defence. Being viewed in this light, and ap|prehending that the &s;tores there would be precariou&s;ly &s;itu|ated, their removal has been determined on to Boundbrook above Brun&s;wic, Princeton, Springfield, and Acquacke|nunk bridge, as places that will not be &s;ubject to &s;udden danger in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould pa&s;s the river, and which have been thought proper as repo&s;itories for &s;ome of our &s;tores of provi&s;ion and forage.</P>
<P>The troops belonging to the flying camp under generals Heard and Beall, with what remains of general Ewing's brigade, are now at Fort-Lee, where they will continue till the &s;tores are got away. By the time that is effected, their term of enli&s;tment will be near expiring; and, if the enemy &s;hould make a pu&s;h in this quarter, the only troops that there will be to oppo&s;e them, will be Hand's, Haz|lett's, the regiments from Virginia, and that, lately Small|wood's,&mdash;the latter greatly reduced by the lo&s;&s;es it &s;u&s;tain|ed
<PB N="300" REF="029737_0299_0FE24AA92B79A768">
on Long-I&s;land, &amp;c. and &s;ickne&s;s: nor are the re&s;t by any means complete. In addition to the&s;e, I am told there are a few of the militia of this State, who have been called in by governor Living&s;ton. I &s;hall make &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition of the whole at Brun&s;wic and at the interme|diate po&s;ts, as &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t likely to guard again&s;t the de&s;igns of the enemy, and to prevent them making an ir|ruption or foraging with detached parties.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed letter from colonels Miles and Atlee will &s;hew Congre&s;s the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of our pri&s;oners in New-York; and their di&s;tre&s;s will become greater every day by the cold inclement &s;ea&s;on that is approaching. It will be happy if &s;ome expedient can be adopted, by which they may be furni&s;hed with nece&s;&s;ary blankets and clothing. Humanity and the good of the &s;ervice require it. I think the mode &s;ugge&s;ted by the&s;e gentlemen, for e&s;tabli&s;hing a credit, appears as likely to &s;ucceed, and as eligible, as any that occurs to me. It is probable many articles that may be wanted can be obtained there, and upon better terms than el&s;ewhere. In re&s;pect to provi&s;ion, their allowance perhaps is as good as the &s;ituation of general Howe's &s;tores will admit of: it has been &s;aid of late by de&s;erters and others that they were rather &s;cant.</P>
<P>By a letter from the payma&s;ter-general, of the &s;even|teenth, he &s;ays there will be a nece&s;&s;ity that large and early remittances &s;hould be made him. The demands, when the troops now in &s;ervice are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, will be extremely great. Be&s;ides, the bounty to recruits will require a large &s;upply; and he adds that the commi&s;&s;ary-general has informed him, that, between this and the la&s;t of December, he &s;hall have occa&s;ion for a million of dollars.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 21. The unhappy affair of the &s;ixteenth has been &s;ucceeded by further misfortunes. Ye&s;terday morn|ing a large body of the enemy landed between Dobbs's ferry and Fort-Lee. Their object was, evidently, to in|clo&s;e the whole of our troops and &s;tores that lay between the North and Hackin&s;ac rivers, which form a very nar|row neck of land. For this purpo&s;e, they formed and marched as &s;oon as they had a&s;cended the high grounds towards the fort. Upon the fir&s;t information of their hav|ing landed, and of their movements, our men were order|ed
<PB N="301" REF="029737_0300_0FE24A72665A5C00">
to meet them: but finding their numbers greatly &s;upe|rior, and that they were extending them&s;elves to &s;eize on the pa&s;&s;es over the river, it was thought prudent to with|draw our men; which was effected, and their retreat &s;e|cured. We lo&s;t the whole of the cannon that was at the fort (except two twelve-pounders) and a great deal of baggage, between two and three hundred tents, about a thou&s;and barrels of flour, and other &s;tores in the quarter-ma&s;ter's department. This lo&s;s was inevitable. As many of the &s;tores had been removed as circum&s;tances and time would admit of. The ammunition had been happily got away.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent &s;ituation between Hackin&s;ac and Pa&s;&s;aic rivers being exactly &s;imilar to our late one, and our force here by no means adequate to an oppo&s;ition that will promi&s;e the &s;malle&s;t probability of &s;ucce&s;s, we are taking mea&s;ures to retire over the waters of the latter, when the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition will be formed that circum&s;tances will ad|mit of.</P>
<P>By colonel Cadwallader, who has been permitted by general Howe to return to his friends, I am informed the &s;urrender of the garri&s;on on the &s;ixteenth was on the com|mon terms as pri&s;oners of war; the lo&s;s of the He&s;&s;ians, about three hundred privates and twenty-&s;even officers kill|ed and wounded; about forty of the Briti&s;h troops, and two or three officers; the lo&s;s on our &s;ide but incon&s;ider|able. I beg leave to refer you to him for a more particu|lar account, and al&s;o for his relation of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our pri&s;oners. Colonels Miles and Atlee's letter, men|tioned above, upon this &s;ubject, was through mi&s;take &s;ent from hence ye&s;terday morning. The mode of relief pro|po&s;ed by them was a credit or &s;upply of ca&s;h through the means of Mr. Franks.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not yet heard that any provi&s;ion is making to &s;upply the place of the troops compo&s;ing the flying camp, who&s;e departure is now at hand. The &s;ituation of our affairs is truly critical, and &s;uch as requires uncommon ex|ertions on our part. From the movements of the enemy, and the information we have received, they certainly will make a pu&s;h to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of this part of the Jer&s;ey. In order that you may be fully appri&s;ed of our weakne&s;s, and of the nece&s;&s;ity there is of our obtaining early &s;uccours, I have, by the advice of the general officers here, directed general Mifflin to wait on you. He is intimately acquaint|ed with our circum&s;tances, and will repre&s;ent them better than my hurried &s;tate will allow.</P>
<P>I have wrote to general Lee to come over with the con|tinental regiments immediately under his command: tho&s;e with general Health I have ordered to &s;ecure the pa&s;&s;es through the Highlands. I have al&s;o wrote to governor Living&s;ton reque&s;ting of him &s;uch aid as may be in his power; and would &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of Con|gre&s;s whether application &s;hould not be made for part of the Penn&s;ylvania militia to &s;tep forth at this pre&s;&s;ing time.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I would mention, if an early and immediate &s;upply of money could be &s;ent to Mr. Dalham to pay the flying camp troops, it might have a happy effect. They would &s;ub&s;i&s;t them&s;elves comfortably on their return, provide many nece&s;&s;aries of which they are in great want; and moreover, it might be the means of inducing many, after &s;eeing their friends, to engage again.</P>
<P>I expected, on coming here, to have met with many of the militia, but find from inquiry that there are not more than from four to five hundred at the different po&s;ts.</P>

their &s;everal inclo&s;ures. The execution of the re&s;olves has been and will be attended to as far as in my power.</P>
<P>I have wrote to general Schuyler to &s;end down as early as po&s;&s;ible the troops in the northern department from this and the State of Penn&s;ylvania.

<P>I have nothing in particular to advi&s;e you of, re&s;pecting the enemy, more than that they are advancing this way.

<P>I HAVE been honoured with your favour of the twenty-&s;ixth, and with its inclo&s;ures, by which I perceive the mea&s;ures that have been adopted for forwarding a re|inforcement of militia. Their arrival is much to be wi&s;h|ed, the &s;ituation of our affairs being truly alarming, and
<PB N="304" REF="029737_0303_0FE24A3622B1D218">
&s;uch as demands the earlie&s;t aids. As general Mifflin's pre&s;ence may have a happy influence on the di&s;po&s;ition and temper of many of the a&s;&s;ociators, I &s;hall not direct his re|turn &s;o long as he can be done without, and till it becomes indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day morning I left Newark, and arrived here ye&s;terday with the troops that were there. It was the opinion of all the generals who were with me, that a re|treat to this place was requi&s;ite, and founded in nece&s;&s;ity, as our force was by no means &s;ufficient to make a &s;tand, with the lea&s;t probability of &s;ucce&s;s, again&s;t an enemy much &s;uperior in number, and who&s;e advanced guards were en|tering the town by the time our rear got out. It was the wi&s;h of all to have remained there longer, and to have halt|ed before we came thus far; but, upon due con&s;ideration of our &s;trength, the circum&s;tances attending the enli&s;tment of a great part of our little force, and the frequent advices that the enemy were embarking or about to embark an|other detachment for Staten-I&s;land with a view of landing at Amboy to co-operate with this, which &s;eemed to be confirmed by the information of &s;ome per&s;ons who came from the i&s;land, that they were collecting and impre&s;&s;ing all the waggons they could find,&mdash;it was judged nece&s;&s;ary to proceed till we came here, not only to prevent their bringing a force to act upon our front and rear, but al&s;o that we might be more convenient to oppo&s;e any troops they might land at South-Amboy, which many conjectur|ed to be an object they had in view. This conjecture too had probability and &s;ome advices to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>I hoped we &s;hould have met with large and early &s;uc|cours by this time: but as yet no great number of the mi|litia of this State has come in; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> have I much rea&s;on to expect that any con&s;iderable aid will be derived from the counties which lie beyond this river, and in which the enemy are. Their &s;ituation will prevent it in a great mea&s;ure from tho&s;e parts where they are, provided the in|clinations of the people were good. Added to this, I have no a&s;&s;urances that more than a very few of the troops compo&s;ing the flying camp will remain after the time of their engagement is out: &s;o far from it, I am told that &s;ome of general Ewing's brigade, who &s;tand engaged to

the fir&s;t of January, are now going away. If tho&s;e go who&s;e &s;ervice expires this day, our force will be reduced to a mere handful.</P>
<P>From intelligence received this morning, one divi&s;ion of the enemy was advanced la&s;t night as far as Elizabeth-town, and &s;ome of their quarter-ma&s;ters had proceeded about four or five miles on this &s;ide, to provide barns, &amp;c. for their accommodation. Other accounts &s;ay another divi&s;ion, compo&s;ed of He&s;&s;ians, are on the road through Springfield, and are reported to have reached that place la&s;t night. I do not know how far their views extend: but I doubt not, they mean to pu&s;h every advantage re&s;ult|ing from the &s;mall number and &s;tate of our troops.</P>
<P>I early began to forward part of the &s;tores from this place towards Philadelphia. Many are gone: the re&s;t we are removing, and hope to &s;ecure.</P>

<P>I AM to acknowledge the receipt of your favours of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-third in&s;tant, which, from the un&s;ettled &s;ituation of our affairs, I have not been able to an&s;wer before.

that &s;o great a quantity of military &s;tores &s;hould be lodg|ed with the army, e&s;pecially at pre&s;ent, as we know not to-day where we &s;hall be obliged to remove to-morrow: and that will in all probability be the ca&s;e while the ene|my continue with a light army on this &s;ide the North-river.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to that part of yours of the nineteenth in which you a&s;k my advice as to the propriety of enli&s;ting pri&s;oners of war, I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that, in my opinion, it is neither con&s;i&s;tent with the rules of war, nor politic: nor can I think, that, becau&s;e our enemies have committed an unju&s;tifiable action, by enticing, and, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> in&s;tances, intimidating our men into their &s;er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e, we ought to follow their example. Before I had the honour of yours on this &s;ubject, I had determined to remon&s;trate to general Howe on this head. As to tho&s;e few who have already enli&s;ted, I would not have them again withdrawn and &s;ent in, be|cau&s;e they might be &s;ubjected to pun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">hment: but I would have the practice di&s;continued in future. If you will re|vert to the capitulation of St. John's and Chamblee, you will find an expre&s;s &s;tipulation again&s;t the enli&s;ting the pri&s;|oners taken there.</P>
<P>I remarked that the enli&s;tment of pri&s;oners was not a politic &s;tep:&mdash;my rea&s;on is this, that in time of danger I have always ob&s;erved &s;uch per&s;ons mo&s;t backward, for fear (I &s;uppo&s;e) of falling into the hands of their former ma&s;|ters, from whom they expect no mercy: and this fear they are apt to communicate to their fellow-&s;oldiers. They are al&s;o mo&s;t ready to de&s;ert when any action is expected, hop|ing, by carrying intelligence, to &s;ecure their peace.</P>
<P>I met captain He&s;keth on the road; and, as the &s;itua|tion of his family did not admit of delay, I permitted him to go immediately to New-York, not having the lea&s;t doubt but general Howe will make a return of any officer of equal rank who &s;hall be required.</P>

you that the enemy are &s;till advancing, and that their van-guard had proceeded as far as Bonem, a &s;mall town about four miles this &s;ide of Woodbridge, according to my la&s;t intelligence. As to their number, reports are various. Some &s;ay they were joined ye&s;terday by a con&s;iderable re|inforcement from Staten-I&s;land. How far this fact may be true, I cannot determine: but, from every information, before, they were between &s;ix and &s;even thou&s;and &s;trong.</P>
<P>I have for &s;ome time pa&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed Philadelphia to be the object of their movement, and have every rea&s;on to be|lieve my opinion well founded,&mdash;the advices of &s;undry per&s;ons who have had an opportunity of mixing and con|ver&s;ing with them on the march, agreeing that &s;uch is the report.

<P>Several officers belonging to the enemy, who were pri&s;|oners, have obtained permi&s;&s;ion to return. I have not yet &s;ent in the names of tho&s;e belonging to us, that are to be exchanged for them.

It would be well if they were relea&s;ed: but, being Virginians, and not knowing that any gentlemen who were taken at the &s;ame time are &s;o circum&s;tanced, I have declined claiming their return without the opinion of Congre&s;s, le&s;t I &s;hould incur the charge of partiality.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent forward colonel Humpton to collect proper boats and craft at the ferry for tran&s;porting our troops: and it will be of infinite importance to have every other craft be&s;ides what he takes for the above purpo&s;e, &s;ecured on the we&s;t &s;ide of Delaware: otherwi&s;e they may fall into the enemy's hands and facilitate their views.</P>

<P>Immediately on my arrival here, I ordered the removal of all the military and other &s;tores and baggage over the Delaware: a great quantity are already got over; and as &s;oon as the boats come up from Philadelphia, we &s;hall load them; by which means I hope to have every thing &s;ecur|ed this night and to-morrow, if we are not di&s;turbed.

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you ye&s;terday, I received a letter from general Lee. On the thirtieth ul|timo he was at Peek&s;kill, and expected to pa&s;s the river with his divi&s;ion two days after. From this intelligence you will readily conclude that he will not be able to afford us any aid for &s;everal days. The report of general St. Clair's having joined him with three or four regiments, I believe to be altogether premature, as he mentions nothing of it. It has ari&s;en, as I am informed, from the return of &s;ome of the Jer&s;ey and Penn&s;ylvania troops from Ticon|deroga, who&s;e time of &s;ervice is expired. They have reached Pluckemin where I have wrote to have them halt|ed and kept together, if they can be prevailed on, till further orders.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed is a copy of a letter which came to hand la&s;t night from major Clark, to which I beg leave to refer you for the intelligence it contains. The number of the enemy &s;aid to be embarked is &s;uppo&s;ed to be rather exag|gerated.
<PB N="311" REF="029737_0310_0FE24A8BA6ACB220">
That there has been an embarkation is not to be doubted, it being confirmed through various channels. By colonel Griffin, who went from Brun&s;wic on Sunday morning with a captain Sims, to pa&s;s him by our guards, and who was detained by lord Cornwallis till Monday evening on account of his &s;ituation, the amount of general Clinton's force, from what he could collect from the offi|cers, was about &s;ix thou&s;and: as to their de&s;tination, he could not obtain the lea&s;t information. By him I al&s;o learn the enemy were in Brun&s;wic, and that &s;ome of their advanced parties had proceeded two miles on this &s;ide. The heavy rain that has fallen has probably checked their progre&s;s, and may prevent their further movement for &s;ome time.</P>

Sorry I am to ob&s;erve, however, that the frequent calls upon the militia of this State, the want of exertion in the principal gentlemen of the country, or a fatal &s;upinene&s;s and in&s;en&s;i|bility of danger till it is too late to prevent an evil that was not only fore&s;een but foretold, have been the cau&s;es of our late di&s;graces.</P>
<P>If the militia of this State had &s;tepped forth in &s;ea&s;on (and timely notice they had,) we might have prevented the enemy's cro&s;&s;ing the Hackin&s;ac, although without &s;ome previous notice of the time and place it was impo&s;&s;ible to have done this at the North-river. We might with equal probability of &s;ucce&s;s have made a &s;tand at Brun&s;wic on the Rariton. But as both the&s;e rivers were fordable in a variety of places (knee-deep only,) it required many men to defend the pa&s;&s;es; and the&s;e we had not. At Hack|in&s;ac our force was in&s;ufficient, becau&s;e a part was at Eliz|abethtown, Amboy, and Brun&s;wic, guarding a coa&s;t which I thought mo&s;t expo&s;ed to danger; and at Brun&s;wic, be|cau&s;e I was di&s;appointed in my expectation of militia, and becau&s;e on the day of the enemy's approach (and probably the occa&s;ion of it) the term of the Jer&s;ey and Maryland brigades &s;ervice expired; neither of which would con&s;ent to &s;tay an hour longer.</P>
<P>The&s;e, among ten thou&s;and other in&s;tances, might be adduced to &s;hew the di&s;advantages of &s;hort enli&s;tments, and the little dependence upon militia in times of real danger. But, as ye&s;terday cannot be recalled, I will not dwell up|on a &s;ubject which, no doubt, has given much unea&s;ine&s;s to Congre&s;s, as well as extreme pain and anxiety to my&s;elf. My fir&s;t wi&s;h is that Congre&s;s may be convinced of the impropriety of relying upon the militia, and of the nece&s;&s;ity of rai&s;ing a larger &s;tanding army than what they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d. The &s;aving in the article of &s;tores, provi&s;ions, and in a thou&s;and other things, by having nothing to do with mili|tia unle&s;s in ca&s;es of extraordinary exigency, and &s;uch as could not be expected in the common cour&s;e of events, would amply &s;upport a large army, which, well officered, would be daily improving, in&s;tead of continuing a de&s;truc|tive, expen&s;ive, and di&s;orderly mob.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="029737_0313_0FE24A45A7B200A8">
I am clear in opinion, that, if forty thou&s;and men had been kept in con&s;tant pay &s;ince the fir&s;t commencement of ho&s;tilities, and the militia had been excu&s;ed doing duty during that period, the continent would have &s;aved money. When I reflect on the lo&s;&s;es we have &s;u&s;tained for want of good troops, the certainty of this is placed beyond a doubt in my mind. In &s;uch ca&s;e, the militia, who have been hara&s;&s;ed and tired by repeated calls upon them (and farm|ing and manufactures in a manner &s;u&s;pended,) would, upon any pre&s;&s;ing emergency, have &punc;run with alacrity to arms; whereas the cry now is, "they may be as well ru|ined in one way as another;" and with difficulty they are obtained.</P>
<P>I mention the&s;e things to &s;hew, that, in my opinion, if any dependence is placed in the militia another year, Con|gre&s;s will be deceived. When danger is a little removed from them, they will not turn out at all. When it comes home to them, the well-affected, in&s;tead of flying to arms to defend them&s;elves, are bu&s;ily employed in removing their families and effects,&mdash;whil&s;t the di&s;affected are concerting mea&s;ures to make their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and &s;pread terror and di&s;may all around, to induce others to follow the exam|ple. Daily experience and abundant-proofs warrant this information.</P>
<P>I &s;hall this day reinforce lord Stirling with about twelve hundred men, which will make his number about two thou&s;and four hundred. To-morrow I mean to repair to Princeton my&s;elf, and &s;hall order the Penn&s;ylvania troops (who are not yet arrived, except part of the German bat|talion and a company of light infantry) to the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>By my la&s;t advices, the enemy are &s;till at Brun&s;wic; and the account adds that general Howe was expected at Eliz|abethtown with a reinforcement, to erect the king's &s;tand|ard, and demand a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of this State. I can only give this as a report brought from the enemy's camp by &s;ome of the country people.</P>

<P>COLONEL Reed would inform you of the intelli|gence which I fir&s;t met with on the road from Trenton to Princeton ye&s;terday. Before I got to the latter, I received a &s;econd expre&s;s informing me, that, as the enemy were advancing by different routes, and attempting by one to get in the rear of our troops which were there, (and who&s;e numbers were &s;mall, and the place by no means defen&s;ible) they had judged it prudent to retreat to Trenton. The retreat was accordingly made, and &s;ince to this &s;ide of the river.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="029737_0315_0FE24A4729B11C68">
This information I thought it my duty to communicate as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, as there is not a moment's time to be lo&s;t in a&s;&s;embling &s;uch force as can be collected: and as the object of the enemy cannot now be doubted in the &s;malle&s;t degree. Indeed I &s;hall be out in my conjecture (for it is only conjecture) if the late embarkation at New-York is not for Delaware river, to co-operate with the ar|my under the immediate command of general Howe, who, I am informed from good authority, is with the Briti&s;h troops and his whole force upon this route.</P>
<P>I have no certain intelligence of general Lee, although I have &s;ent frequent expre&s;&s;es to him, and lately a colonel Humpton to bring me &s;ome accurate accounts of his &s;itu|ation.

<P>In the di&s;ordered and moving &s;tate of the army, I can|not get returns: but, from the be&s;t accounts, we had be|tween three thou&s;and and three thou&s;and five hundred men, before the Philadelphia militia and German battalion arriv|ed:&mdash;they amount to about two thou&s;and.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DID my&s;elf the honour of writing to you ye&s;ter|day, and informing you that I had removed the troops to this &s;ide of the Delaware. Soon after, the enemy made their appearance, and their van entered ju&s;t as our rear guard quitted. We had removed all our &s;tores, except a few boards. From the be&s;t information, they are in two bod|ies, one at and near Trenton, the other &s;ome miles higher up, and inclining towards Delaware; but whether with intent to cro&s;s there, or throw them&s;elves between general Lee and me, is yet uncertain.</P>
<P>I have this morning detached lord Stirling with his brigade, to take po&s;t at the different landing-places, and prevent them from &s;tealing a march upon us from above:
<PB N="317" REF="029737_0316_0FE24A9031A30BE8">
for I am informed, if they cro&s;s at Coryel's ferry or there-abouts, they are as near to Philadelphia, as we are here. From &s;everal accounts I am led to think that the enemy are bringing boats with them: if &s;o, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for our &s;mall force to give them any con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition in the pa&s;&s;age of the river, [<HI>as they may</HI>] make a feint at one place, and, by a &s;udden removal, carry their boats higher or lower before we can bring our cannon to play upon them.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the &s;ecurity of Philadelphia &s;hould be our next object. From my own remembrance, but more from information, (for I never viewed the ground) I &s;hould think that a communication of lines and redoubts might &s;oon be formed from the Delaware to Schuylkill on the north entrance of the city, the lines to begin on the Schuylkill &s;ide, about the heights of Springate|b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ry, and run ea&s;tward to Delaware, upon the mo&s;t advan|tageous and commanding grounds. If &s;omething of this kind is not done, the enemy might, in ca&s;e any misfortune &s;hould b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">al us, march directly in, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. We have ever found that lin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light, are very formidable to them: they would at lea&s;t give a check till people could recover of the fright and con&s;ternation that naturally attends the fir&s;t appearance of an enemy.</P>
<P>In the mean time every &s;tep &s;hould be taken to collect force, not only from Penn&s;ylvania, but from the mo&s;t neigh|bourly States. If we can keep the enemy from entering Philadelphia, and keep the communication by water open for &s;upplies, we may yet make a &s;tand, if the country will come to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance till our new levies can be collected.</P>
<P>If the mea&s;ure of fortifying the city &s;hould be adopted, &s;ome &s;kilful per&s;on &s;hould immediately view the grounds, and begin to trace out the lines and works.

<P>AFTER I had wrote you ye&s;terday, I received cer|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> information that the enemy, after repairing Cro&s;wix's br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ge, had advanced a party of about five hundred to Bordentown.

<P><PB N="319" REF="029737_0318_0FE24A98E0C73858">
I la&s;t night directed commodore Seymour to &s;tation all his galleys between Bordentown and Philadelphia, to give the earlie&s;t intelligence of any appearance of the enemy on the Jer&s;ey &s;hore.</P>
<P>I ye&s;terday rode up the river about eleven miles, to lord Stirling's po&s;t, where I found a pri&s;oner of the forty-&s;econd regiment who had been ju&s;t brought in. He informed me that lord Cornwallis was at Pennytown with two battalions of grenadiers, and three of light infantry, all Briti&s;h, the He&s;&s;ian grenadiers, the forty-&s;econd Highland regiment, and two other battalions, the names of which he did not remember. He knew nothing of the rea&s;ons of their be|ing a&s;&s;embled there, nor what were their future intentions. But I la&s;t night received information from my lord Stir|ling, which had been brought in by his &s;couts, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure accounted for their being there. They had made a forced march from Trenton on Sunday night, to Coryel's ferry, in hopes of &s;urpri&s;ing a &s;ufficient number of boats to tran&s;port them; but, finding them&s;elves di&s;ap|pointed, had marched back to Pennytown, where they re|mained ye&s;terday. From their &s;everal attempts to &s;eize boats, it does not look as if they had brought any with them, as I was at one time informed. I la&s;t night &s;ent a per&s;on over to Trenton, to learn whether there was any appearance of building any: but he could not perceive any preparations for a work of that kind; &s;o that I am in hopes, if proper care is taken to keep all the craft out of their way, they will find the cro&s;&s;ing of Delaware a matter of con&s;iderable difficulty.</P>
<P>I received another letter from general Lee la&s;t evening: it was dated at Chatham (which I take to be near Mor|ri&s;town) the eighth of this month. He had then received my letter &s;ent by major Hoops, but &s;eemed &s;till inclined to hang upon the enemy's rear, to which I &s;hould have no objection, had I a &s;ufficient force to oppo&s;e them in front: but as I have not at pre&s;ent, nor do I &s;ee much probabil|ity of further reinforcement, I have wrote to him in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing terms, to join me with all expedition.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I LAST night received the favour of Mr. Thomp|&s;on's letter inclo&s;ing the proceedings of Congre&s;s, of the eleventh in&s;tant. As the publication of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> re&s;olve, is my opinion, will not lead to any good end, but, on the contrary, may be attended with &s;ome bad con&s;equences, I &s;hall take the liberty to decline in&s;erting it in this day's orders. I am per&s;uaded, if the &s;ubject is taken up and re|con&s;idered, that Congre&s;s will concur with me in &s;entiment. I doubt not but there are &s;ome who have propagated the report: but what if they have? Their remaining in or leaving Philadelphia mu&s;t be governed by circum&s;tances and events. If their departure &s;hould become nece&s;&s;ary, it will be right: on the other hand, if there &s;hould not be a nece&s;&s;ity for it, they will remain, and their continuance will &s;hew the report to be the production of calumny and fal&s;ehood. In a word, Sir, I conceive it a matter that may be as well di&s;regarded; and that the removal or &s;tay|ing of Congre&s;s, depending entirely upon events, &s;hould not have been the &s;ubject of a re&s;olve.</P>
<P>The intelligence we obtain re&s;pecting the movements and &s;ituation of the enemy is far from being &s;o certain and &s;atisfactory as I could wi&s;h, though every probable means in my power, and that I can devi&s;e, are adopted for that
<PB N="321" REF="029737_0320_0FE24A9B787B5DA8">
purpo&s;e. The late&s;t I have received was from lord Stir|ling la&s;t night. He &s;ays that two grenadiers of the In|ni&s;killen regiment, who were taken and brought in by &s;ome countrymen, inform that generals Howe, Corn|wallis, Vaughan, &amp;c. with about &s;ix thou&s;and of the flying army, were at Pennytown, waiting for pontons to come up, with which they mean to pa&s;s the river near the Blue Mounts, or at Coryel's ferry,&mdash;they believe, the latter;&mdash;that the two battalions of guards were at Brun&s;wic, and the He&s;&s;ian grenadiers, cha&s;&s;eurs, and a regiment or two of Briti&s;h troops, are at Trenton.</P>
<P>Captain Miller of colonel Hand's regiment al&s;o informs me, that a body of the enemy were marching to Burling|ton ye&s;terday morning. He had been &s;ent over with a &s;trong &s;couting party, and, at day-break, fell in with their advanced guards con&s;i&s;ting of about four hundred He&s;&s;ian troops, who fired upon him before they were di&s;covered, but without any lo&s;s, and obliged him to retreat with his party and to take boat. The number of the whole he could not a&s;certain: but it appeared to be con&s;iderable. Captain Miller's account is partly confirmed by commodore Seymour, who reports that four or five hundred of the en|emy had entered the town. Upon the whole, there can be no doubt but that Philadelphia is their object, and that they will pa&s;s the Delaware as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. Happy &s;hould I be if I could &s;ee the means of preventing them: at pre&s;ent, I confe&s;s, I do not. All military writers agree that it is a work of great difficulty, nay, impracticable, where there is any extent of coa&s;t to guard. This is the ca&s;e with us; and we have to do it with a force &s;mall and incon&s;iderable, and much inferior to that of the enemy. Perhaps Congre&s;s have &s;ome hope and pro&s;pect of rein|forcements: I have no intelligence of the &s;ort, and wi&s;h to be informed on the &s;ubject. Our little handful is daily decrea&s;ing by &s;ickne&s;s and other cau&s;es: and, without aid, without con&s;iderable &s;uccours and exertions on the part of the people, what can we rea&s;onably look for o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> expect, but an event that will be &s;everely felt by the common cau&s;e, and that will wound the heart of every virtuous American,&mdash;the lo&s;s of Philadelphia? The &s;ubject is di&s;agreeable: but yet it is true. I will leave it, wi&s;hing that our &s;itua|tion
<PB N="322" REF="029737_0321_0FE24A551D774A08">
may become &s;uch as to do away the apprehen&s;ions which at this time &s;eem to fill the minds of too many, and with too much ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Heath, dated at Peek&s;kill, the eighth, I am advi&s;ed that lieutenant-colonel Vo&s;e was then there with Greaton's, Bond's, and Porter's regiment, amounting in the whole to between five and &s;ix hundred men, who were coming this way. He adds that generals Gates and Arnold would be at Go&s;hen that night, with S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ark's, Poor's, and Read's regiments; but for what pur|po&s;e he does not mention.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed extract of a letter which I received la&s;t night contains intelligence of an agreeable nature. I wi&s;h to hear its confirmation by the arrival of the &s;everal prizes: that with clothing and arms will be an invaluable acqui|&s;ition.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be glad to be advi&s;ed of the mode I am to ob&s;erve in paying the officers; whether they are to be allowed to draw the pay lately e&s;tabli&s;hed, and from what time, or how long they are to be paid under the old e&s;tabli&s;hment. A pay-roll which was pre&s;ented ye&s;terday, being made up for the new, has given ri&s;e to the&s;e propo&s;itions. Upon my objecting to it, I was told that Congre&s;s or the board of war had e&s;tabli&s;hed the precedent, by paying the &s;ixth regiment of Virginia troops commanded by colonel Buck|ner, agreeable to the latter, as they came through Phila|delphia.</P>

<P>Four brigades of the army, under generals lord Stirling, Mercer, Stephen and De Fermoy, extend from Yardley's up to Coryel's ferry, po&s;ted in &s;uch a manner as to guard every &s;u&s;picious part of the river, and to afford a&s;&s;i&s;tance to each other in ca&s;e of attack. General Ewing, with the flying camp of Penn&s;ylvania, and a few Jer&s;ey troops under general Dickin&s;on, are po&s;ted from Yardley's ferry down to the ferry oppo&s;ite Bordentown. Colonel Cad|wallader, with the Penn&s;ylvania militia, occupies the ground above and below the mouth of Ne&s;haminy river as far down as Dunk's ferry, at which place colonel Nixon is po&s;ted with the third battalion of [<HI>Penn&s;ylvania. </HI>] A proper quantity of artillery is appointed to each brigade; and I have ordered &s;mall redoubts to be thrown up oppo|&s;ite every place where there is a po&s;&s;ibility of fording. I &s;hall remove further up the river to be near the main body of my &s;mall army, with which every po&s;&s;ible oppo&s;ition &s;hall be given to any further approach of the enemy to|wards Philadelphia.</P>
<P>As general Arm&s;trong has a good deal of influence in this State, and our pre&s;ent force is &s;mall and incon&s;idera|ble, I think he cannot be better employed than to repair to the counties where his intere&s;t lies, to animate the peo|ple, promote the recruiting &s;ervice, and encourage the mi|litia to come in. He will al&s;o be able to form a proper judgment of the places &s;uitable for magazines of provi&s;ion to be collected. I have reque&s;ted him to wait upon Con|gre&s;s on this &s;ubject: and if general Smallwood &s;hould go to Maryland on the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s, I think it would have a happy effect: he is popular and of great influence, and, I am per&s;uaded, would contribute greatly to that State's furni&s;hing her quota of men in a little time. He is now in Philadelphia.</P>

<P>ABOUT one o'clock to day I received a letter from general Sullivan, a copy of which you have inclo&s;ed. I will not comment on the melancholy intelligence which it contains, only adding that I &s;incerely regret general Lee's unhappy fate, and feel much for the lo&s;s of my country in his captivity.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the enemy, they have been indu&s;trious in their attempts to procure boats and &s;mall craft: but as yet their efforts have not &s;ucceeded. From the late&s;t advices that I have of their movements by &s;ome pri&s;oners and others, they appear to be leaving Trenton, and to be filing off towards Princeton and Allentown. What their de|&s;igns are, whether they mean to retreat, or only a feint, cannot be determined. I have parties out to watch their n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tions, and to form, if po&s;&s;ible, an accurate opinion of their plans.</P>
<P>Our force, &s;ince my la&s;t, has received no augmentation,&mdash;of cour&s;e, by &s;ickne&s;s and other cau&s;es, has dimini&s;hed: but I am advi&s;ed by a letter from the council of &s;afety, which ju&s;t came to hand, that colonels Burd and Gil|breath are marching with their battalions of militia, and al&s;o that &s;ome &s;mall parties are a&s;&s;embling in Cumberland county. * * *</P>

<P>IN a late letter which I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you, I took the liberty to recommend that more battalions &s;hould be rai&s;ed for the new army than what had been voted. Having fully con&s;idered the matter, I am more and more convinced not only of the propriety but of the nece&s;&s;ity of the mea&s;ure. That the enemy will leave noth|ing un-e&s;&s;ayed in the cour&s;e of the next campaign to re|duce the&s;e States to the rule of a mo&s;t * * *, mu&s;t be obvious to every one; and that the militia is not to be depended on, or aid expected from them but in ca&s;es of the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing emergency, is not to be doubted. The
<PB N="325" REF="029737_0324_0FE24A9E81968650">
fir&s;t of the&s;e propo&s;itions is unque&s;tionable, and fatal ex|perience has given her &s;anction to the truth of the latter: indeed their lethargy of late, and backwardne&s;s to turn out at this alarming cri&s;is, &s;eem to ju&s;tify an apprehen&s;ion that nothing can bring them from their homes. For want of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, a large part of Jer&s;ey has been expo&s;ed to ravage and to plunder; nor do I know that Penn&s;ylvania would &s;hare a better fate, could general Howe effect a pa&s;|&s;age acro&s;s the Delaware with a re&s;pectable force. The&s;e con&s;iderations have induced me to wi&s;h that no reliance, except &s;uch as may ari&s;e from nece&s;&s;ity, &s;hould ever be had in them again; and to make further mention to Congre&s;s of the expediency of increa&s;ing their army. I tru&s;t the mea&s;ure will meet their earlie&s;t attention.</P>
<P>Had I lei&s;ure and were it nece&s;&s;ary, I could &s;ay much upon this head: but, as I have not, and the matter is well under&s;tood, I will not add much. By augmenting the number of your battalions, you will augment your force: the officers of each will have their intere&s;t and influence; and, upon the whole, their numbers will be much greater, though they &s;hould not be complete. Added to this, from the pre&s;ent confu&s;ed &s;tate of Jer&s;ey, and the improper ap|pointment of officers in many in&s;tances, I have little or no expectation that &s;he will be able to rai&s;e all the troops ex|acted from her, though I think it might be done, were &s;uitable &s;pirited gentlemen commi&s;&s;ioned, who would exert them&s;elves, and encourage the people, many of whom (for a failure in this in&s;tance, and who are well di&s;po&s;ed) are making their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions. In a word, the next will be a trying campaign: and as all that is dear and valuable may depend upon the i&s;&s;ue of it, I would advi&s;e that nothing &s;hould be omitted, that &s;hall &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary to our &s;ucce&s;s. Let us have a re&s;pectable army, and &s;uch as will be com|petent to every exigency.</P>
<P>I will al&s;o add that the critical &s;ituation of our affairs, and the di&s;&s;olution of our pre&s;ent force, (now at hand) re|quire that every nerve and exertion be employed for re|cruiting the new battalions. One part of general Howe's movements at this time, I believe, is with a de&s;ign to di&s;|tract us and prevent this bu&s;ine&s;s. If the inclemency of the weather &s;hould force him into winter-quarters, he will not remain there longer than nece&s;&s;ity &s;hall oblige him: he
<PB N="326" REF="029737_0325_0FE24A60001D76F8">
will commence his operations in a &s;hort &s;pace of time; and in that time our levies mu&s;t be made up, to oppo&s;e him, or I fear the mo&s;t melancholy of all events mu&s;t take place.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed extract of a letter from the commi&s;&s;ary-general will &s;hew his demands for money, and his plans for procuring &s;alted provi&s;ions and a quantity of flour from the &s;outhward. The whole is &s;ubmitted to the con&s;idera|tion of Congre&s;s; and I wi&s;h the re&s;ult of their opinion to be tran&s;mitted him, with &s;uch &s;upplies of money as may be nece&s;&s;ary for him&s;elf and the departments he mentions.</P>
<P>The clothing of the troops is a matter of infinite import|ance, and, if it could be accompli&s;hed, would have a hap|py effect. Their di&s;tre&s;&s;es are extremely great, many of them being entirely naked, and mo&s;t &s;o thinly clad as to be unfit for &s;ervice. I mu&s;t entreat Congre&s;s to write to the agents and contractors upon this &s;ubject, that every po&s;&s;ible &s;upply may be procured and forwarded with the utmo&s;t expedition. I cannot attend to the bu&s;ine&s;s my&s;elf, having more than I can po&s;&s;ibly do be&s;ides.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE waited with much impatience to know the determinations of Congre&s;s on the propo&s;itions made &s;ome time in October la&s;t for augmenting our corps of artillery and e&s;tabli&s;hing a corps of engineers. The time is now come when the fir&s;t cannot be delayed without the great|e&s;t injury to the &s;afety of the&s;e States; and therefore, un|der the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s bearing date the twelfth in|&s;tant, at the repeated in&s;tances of colonel Knox, and by the pre&s;&s;ing advice of all the general officers now here, I have ventured to order three battalions of artillery to be immediately recruited. The&s;e are two le&s;s than colonel Knox recommends, as you will &s;ee by his plan inclo&s;ed: but then this &s;cheme comprehends all the United States, whereas &s;ome of the States have corps already e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the&s;e three battalions are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for the operations in this quarter, including the northern de|partment.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="029737_0326_0FE24AA65B36B878">
The pay of our artilleri&s;ts bearing no proportion with that in the Engli&s;h or French &s;ervice,&mdash;the murmuring and di&s;&s;atisfaction thereby occa&s;ioned, and the ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;i|bility (as I am told) of getting them upon the old terms,&mdash;and the unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity of obtaining them at all events,&mdash;have induced me (al&s;o by advice) to promi&s;e officers and men that their pay &s;hould be augmented twen|ty-five per cent, or that the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> engagements &s;hall become null and void. This may appear to Congre&s;s premature and unwarrantable. But, Sir, if they view our &s;ituation in the light it &s;trikes their officers, they will be convinced of the utility of the mea&s;ure, and that the execution could not be delayed till after their meeting at Baltimore. In &s;hort, the pre&s;ent exigency of our affairs will not admit of delay either in council or the field: for well convinced I am, that, if the enemy go into quarters at all, it will be for a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on. But I rather think the de&s;ign of gen|eral Howe is to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of Philadelphia this winter, if po&s;&s;ible; and in truth I do not &s;ee what is to prevent him, as ten days more will put an end to the exi&s;tence of our army. That one great point is to keep us as much hara&s;&s;ed as po&s;&s;ible, with a view to injure the recruiting &s;ervice and hinder a collection of &s;tores and other nece&s;|&s;aries for the next campaign, I am as clear in, as I am of my exi&s;tence. If therefore,&mdash;[<HI>when</HI>] we have to provide in this &s;hort interval, and make the&s;e great and arduous preparations,&mdash;every matter that in its nature is &s;elf-evident is to be referred to Congre&s;s at the di&s;tance of a hundred and thirty or forty miles, &s;o much time mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily elap&s;e, as to defeat the end in view.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid that this is an application for powers that are too dangerous to be entru&s;ted. I can only add that de&s;perate di&s;ea&s;es require de&s;perate remedies; and with truth declare that I have no lu&s;t after power, but wi&s;h with as much fervency as any man upon this wide-extend|ed continent for an opportunity of turning the &s;word into a plough&s;hare. But my feelings, as an officer and a man, have been &s;uch as to force me to &s;ay that no per&s;on ever had a greater choice of difficulties to contend with than I have. It is needle&s;s to add that &s;hort enli&s;tments, and a mi&s;taken dependence upon militia, have been the origin of all our misfortunes and the great accumulation of our debt.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="029737_0327_0FE24A61B13AD438">
We find, Sir, that the enemy are daily gathering &s;trength from the di&s;affected. This &s;trength, like a &s;now-ball, by rolling, will increa&s;e, unle&s;s &s;ome means can be devi&s;ed to check effectually the progre&s;s of the enemy's arms. Mi|litia may po&s;&s;ibly do it for a little while: but in a little while al&s;o, the militia of tho&s;e States which have been fre|quently called upon will not turn out at all; or, if they do, it will be with &s;o much reluctance and &s;loth, as to amount to the &s;ame thing:&mdash;in&s;tance, New Jer&s;ey!&mdash;wit|ne&s;s, Penn&s;ylvania!&mdash;Could any thing but the river Dela|ware have &s;aved Philadelphia?&mdash;Can any thing (the exi|gency of the ca&s;e indeed may ju&s;tify it) be more de&s;truc|tive to the recruiting &s;ervice, than giving ten dollars bounty for &s;ix weeks' &s;ervice of the militia, who come in, you cannot tell how,&mdash;go, you cannot tell when,&mdash;and act, you cannot tell where,&mdash;con&s;ume your provi&s;ions, exhau&s;t your &s;tores, and leave you at la&s;t at a critical moment?</P>
<P>The&s;e, Sir, are the men I am to depend upon ten days hence: this is the ba&s;is on which your cau&s;e will and mu&s;t forever depend, till you get a large &s;tanding army &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to oppo&s;e the enemy. I therefore beg leave to give it as my humble opinion, that eighty-eight battalions are by no means equal to the oppo&s;ition you are to make, and that a moment's time is not to be lo&s;t in rai&s;ing a great|er number,&mdash;not le&s;s, in my opinion and the opinion of my officers, than a hundred and ten. It may be urged that it will be found difficult enough to complete the fir&s;t number. This may be true, and yet the officers of a hun|dred and ten battalions will recruit many more men, than tho&s;e of eighty-eight. In my judgment this is not a time to &s;tand upon expen&s;e: our funds are the only object of con&s;ideration. The State of New-York have added one battalion (I wi&s;h they had made it two) to their quota. If any good officers offer to rai&s;e men upon continental pay and e&s;tabli&s;hment in this quarter, I &s;hall encourage them to do &s;o, and regiment them when they have done it. If Congre&s;s di&s;approve of this proceeding, they will plea&s;e to &s;ignify it, as I mean it for the be&s;t.</P>
<P>It may be thought that I am going a good deal out of the line of my duty, to adopt the&s;e mea&s;ures, or to advi&s;e thus freely. A character to lo&s;e,&mdash;an e&s;tate to forfeit,&mdash;
<PB N="329" REF="029737_0328_0FE1BFA7F1194660">
the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings of liberty at &s;take,&mdash;and a life de|voted,&mdash;mu&s;t be my excu&s;e.</P>
<P>I have heard nothing of the light-hor&s;e from Virginia, nor the regiment from the Ea&s;tern-Shore. I wi&s;h to know what troops are to act in the different departments, and to have tho&s;e from the &s;outhward (de&s;igned for this place) ordered on as fa&s;t as they &s;hall be rai&s;ed. The route &s;hould be pointed out by which they are to march; a&s;&s;i&s;tant-com|mi&s;&s;aries and quarter-ma&s;ters upon the communication, to &s;upply their wants; the fir&s;t or &s;econd officer of each bat|talion to forward them, and the other to come on, receive and form them at their place of de&s;tination. Unle&s;s this is immediately &s;et about, the campaign, if it &s;hould be clo&s;|ed, will be opened in the &s;pring before we have any men in the field.</P>
<P>Every exertion &s;hould be u&s;ed to procure tents: a clothier-general &s;hould be appointed without lo&s;s of time for &s;upplying the army with every article in that way:&mdash;he &s;hould be a man of bu&s;ine&s;s and abilities. A commi&s;&s;ary of pri&s;oners mu&s;t be appointed to attend the army:&mdash;for want of an officer of this kind, the exchange of pri&s;oners has been conducted in a mo&s;t &s;hameful and injurious man|ner. We have had them from all quarters pu&s;hed into our camps at the mo&s;t critical junctures, and without the lea&s;t previous notice. We have had them travelling through the different States in all directions by certificates from committees, without any kind of control; and have had in&s;tances of &s;ome going into the enemy's camp without my privity or knowledge, after pa&s;&s;ing in the manner before mentioned. There may be other officers nece&s;&s;ary which I do not recollect at this time, and which, when thought of, mu&s;t be provided: for this, Sir, you may rely on, that the commanding officer, under the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, is obliged to attend to the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o many different de|partments, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible to conduct that of his own with the attention nece&s;&s;ary;&mdash;than which, nothing can be more injurious.</P>
<P>In a former letter, I intimated my opinion of the nece&s;|&s;ity of having a brigadier for every three regiments, and a major-general to every three brigades, at mo&s;t. I think no time is to be lo&s;t in making the appointments, that the arrangements may be con&s;equent. This will not only aid
<PB N="330" REF="029737_0329_0FE24A633506D828">
the recruiting &s;ervice, but will be the readie&s;t means of forming and di&s;ciplining the army afterwards, which, in the &s;hort time we have to do it, is of amazing con&s;equence. I have laboured, ever &s;ince I have been in the &s;ervice, to di&s;courage all kinds of local attachments and di&s;tinctions of country, denominating the whole by the greater name of <HI>'American:'</HI> but I found it impo&s;&s;ible to overcome preju|dices; and, under the new e&s;tabli&s;hment, I conceive it be&s;t to &s;tir up an emulation; in order to do which, would it not be better for each State to furni&s;h (though not to ap|point) their own brigadiers?&mdash;This, if known to be part of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, might prevent a good deal of conten|tion and jealou&s;y; and would, I believe, be the means of promotions going forward with more &s;atisfaction, and quiet the higher officers.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I am &s;peaking of promotions, I cannot help giv|ing it as my opinion, that, if Congre&s;s think proper to con|firm what I have done with re&s;pect to the corps of artille|ry, colonel Knox (at pre&s;ent at the head of that depart|ment, but who, without promotion, will re&s;ign) ought to be appointed to the command of it, with the rank and pay of brigadier. I have al&s;o to mention, that, for want of &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hment in the department of engineers agreea|ble to the plan laid before Congre&s;s in October la&s;t, colo|nel Putnam, who was at the head of it, has quitted, and taken a regiment in the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. I know of no other man tolerably well qualified for the conducting of that bu&s;ine&s;s. None of the French gentlemen whom I have &s;een with appointments in that way appear to me to know any thing of the matter. There is one in Philadel|phia, who, I am told, is clever: but him I have never &s;een.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o once more beg leave to mention to Congre&s;s the expediency of letting promotions be in a regimental line. The want of this has already driven &s;ome of the be&s;t officers that were in your army, out of the &s;ervice. From repeated and &s;trict inquiry I am convinced you can adopt no mode of promotion that will be better received, or that will give more general &s;atisfaction. I wi&s;h therefore to have it announced.</P>
<P>The ca&s;ting of cannon is a matter that ought not to be one moment delayed: and therefore I &s;hall &s;end colonel Knox to put this in a train, as al&s;o to have travelling car|riages
<PB N="331" REF="029737_0330_0FE24AAAAFA2D6E8">
and &s;hot provided,&mdash;elaboratories to be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, one in Hartford<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and another in York. Magazines of provi&s;ions &s;hould al&s;o be had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n. The&s;e I &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with the commi&s;&s;ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. As our great lo&s;s la&s;t year proceeded from a want of teams. I &s;hall direct the quarter ma&s;ter-gen|eral to furni&s;h a certain number to each regiment to an&s;wer the common purpo&s;es thereof, that the army may be ena|bled to remove from place to place differently from what we have done, or could do, this campaign. Ammunition carts, and proper carts for intrenching tools, &s;hould al&s;o be provided, and I &s;hall direct about them accordingly. Above all, a &s;tore of &s;mall arms &s;hould be provided, or men will be of little u&s;e. The con&s;umption and wa&s;te of the&s;e, this year, has been great:&mdash;militia, flying-camp men, &amp;c. coming in without, were obliged to be furni&s;hed, or become u&s;ele&s;s. Many of the&s;e threw their arms away: &s;ome lo&s;t them, whil&s;t others de&s;erted, and took them away. In a word, although I u&s;ed every precaution to pre&s;erve them, the lo&s;s has been great; and this will forever be the ca&s;e in &s;uch a mixed and irregular army as ours has been.</P>
<P>If no part of the troops already embarked at New-York has appeared in Virginia, their de&s;tination doubtle&s;s mu&s;t be to &s;ome other quarter; and that State mu&s;t, I &s;hould think, be freed from any inva&s;ion, if general Howe can be effectually oppo&s;ed in this. I therefore inclo&s;e a memo|randum given me by brigadier Stephen of Virginia, which Congre&s;s will plea&s;e to adopt in the whole,&mdash;in part,&mdash;or reject,&mdash;as may be con&s;i&s;tent with their plans and intelli|gence.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ion of the army, late under the command of general Lee, now general Sullivan, is ju&s;t upon the point of joining us. A &s;trange kind of fatality has attended it. They had orders on the &s;eventeenth of November to join, now more than a month. General Gates, with four ea&s;t|ern regiments, is al&s;o near at hand: three others from tho&s;e States were coming on, by his order, by the way of Peek&s;kill, and had joined general Heath whom I had or|dered on with Par&s;ons's brigade, to join me, leaving Clin|ton's brigade and &s;ome militia (that were at Forts Mont|gomery and Con&s;titution) to guard tho&s;e important pa&s;&s;es of the Highlands. But the convention of the State of
<PB N="332" REF="029737_0331_0FE24A64B9640C10">
New-York &s;eeming to be much alarmed at Heath's coming away,&mdash;a fleet appearing off New-London,&mdash;and &s;ome part of the enemy's troops retiring towards Brun&s;wic,&mdash;induc|ed me to countermand the order for the march of Par&s;ons's brigade, and to direct the three regiments from Ticonderoga to halt at Morri&s;town in Jer&s;ey (where I under&s;tand about eight hundred militia had collected,) in order to in&s;pirit the inhabitants, and, as far as po&s;&s;ible, cover that part of the country. I &s;hall &s;end general Maxwell this day to take the command of them, and, if to be done, to hara&s;s and annoy the enemy in their quarters, and cut off their convoys.</P>
<P>The care and vigilance, which were u&s;ed in &s;ecuring the boats on this river, have hitherto baffled every attempt of the enemy to cro&s;s: but, from concurring reports and appearances, they are waiting for ice to afford them a pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Since writing the foregoing I have received a letter from governor Cooke of Rhode-I&s;land, of which the inclo&s;ed is a copy. Previous to this, and immediately upon the fir&s;t intelligence obtained of a fleet's going through the Sound, I di&s;patched orders to generals Spencer and Arnold to proceed without the lea&s;t delay to the ea&s;tward. The fir&s;t, I pre&s;ume, is gone: the latter, not getting my letter till he came to a place called Ea&s;ton, was, by advice of general Gates who al&s;o met my letter at the &s;ame place, induced to come on hither before he proceeded to the ea&s;tward. Mo&s;t of our brigadiers are laid up: not one has come on with the divi&s;ion under general Sullivan, but they are left &s;ick at different places on the road.</P>
<P>By accounts from the ea&s;tward, a large body of men had a&s;&s;embled in Rhode-I&s;land from the States of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts and Connecticut. I pre&s;ume (but I have no ad|vice of it) that the militia, ordered from the fir&s;t to ren|dezvous at Danbury (&s;ix thou&s;and in number) under the command of major general Lincoln, for &s;upplying the place of the di&s;banded men of that State in the continental army, will now be ordered to Rhode-I&s;land.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of general Lincoln, I &s;hould not do him ju&s;tice, were I not to add that he is a gentleman well wor|thy of notice in the military line. He commanded the militia from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts la&s;t &s;ummer, or fall rather, and much to my &s;atisfaction,&mdash;having proved him&s;elf on all

occa&s;ions an active, &s;pirited, &s;en&s;ible man. I do not know whether it is his wi&s;h to remain in the military line, or whether, if he &s;hould, any thing under the rank he now holds in the State he comes from would &s;atisfy him. How far an appointment of this kind might offend the continen|tal brigadiers, I cannot undertake to &s;ay: many there are, over whom he ought not to be placed; but I know of no way to di&s;criminate. Brigadier Reed of New-Hamp&s;hire does not, I pre&s;ume, mean to continue in &s;ervice: he ought not,&mdash;as I am told, by the &s;everity of the &s;mall-pox, he is become both blind and deaf.</P>

<P>P. S. Generals Gates and Sullivan have this in&s;tant come in. By them I learn that few or no men are recruited out of the regiments coming on with them, and that there is very little rea&s;on to expect that the&s;e regiments will be prevailed upon to continue after their term of &s;er|vice expires. If militia then do not come in, the con&s;e|quences are but too evident.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT I &s;hould dwell upon the &s;ubject of our di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, cannot be more di&s;agreeable to Congre&s;s than it is painful to my&s;elf. The alarming &s;ituation to which our affairs are reduced impels me to the mea&s;ure. Inquiry and inve&s;tigation,&mdash;which in mo&s;t ca&s;es &s;erve to develop and point out a remedy, in ours, pre&s;ent more and greater difficulties. Till of late, I was led to hope from report that no incon&s;iderable part of the troops compo&s;ing the regiments that were with general Lee, and tho&s;e from Ti|conderoga under general Gates, had enli&s;ted again. This intelligence, I confe&s;s, gave me rea&s;on to expect that I &s;hould have, at the expiration of the pre&s;ent year, a force &s;omewhat more re&s;pectable than what I find will be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Having examined into the &s;tate of tho&s;e regiments, I am authori&s;ed to &s;ay from the information of their officers, that but very few of the men have enli&s;ted. Tho&s;e who have are of the troops from Ticonderoga, and were permitted to vi&s;it their friends and homes, as part of the terms on which they would re-engage. In re&s;pect to tho&s;e who marched
<PB N="334" REF="029737_0333_0FE24A6CC7DC2178">
with general Lee, I cannot learn that any have. Their refu&s;al, I am told, has not proceeded more from an aver&s;ion to the &s;ervice, or any fixed determination not to engage again, than from their wi&s;hes to return home,&mdash;the non-appointment of officers in &s;ome in&s;tances,&mdash;the turning out of good, and appointing of bad,&mdash;and in others, the incom|plete or rather no arrangement of them,&mdash;a work unhappi|ly committed to the management of their States: nor have I the mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect of retaining them a moment longer than the la&s;t of this in&s;tant, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitations and the obvious nece&s;&s;ity for it.</P>
<P>By the departure of the&s;e regiments I &s;hall be left with five from Virginia, Smallwood's from Maryland, a &s;mall part of Rawlins's, Hand's from Penn&s;ylvania, a part of Ward's from Connecticut, and the German battalion, amounting in the whole at this time from fourteen to fif|teen hundred effective men. This handful, and &s;uch mili|tia as may choo&s;e to join me, will then compo&s;e our army.</P>
<P>When I reflect upon the&s;e things they fill me with much concern, knowing that general Howe has a number of troops cantoned in the towns bordering on and near the Del|aware,&mdash;his intentions being to pa&s;s, as &s;oon as the ice is &s;uf|ficiently formed, to invade Penn&s;ylvania and to po&s;&s;e&s;s him|&s;elf of Philadelphia if po&s;&s;ible. To guard again&s;t his de|&s;igns and the execution of them, &s;hall employ my every exertion: but how is this to be done? As yet but few militia have gone to Philadelphia, and they are to be our &s;upport at this alarming cri&s;is. Had I entertained a doubt of general Howe's intentions to pa&s;s the Delaware on the di&s;&s;olution of our army, and as &s;oon as the ice is made, it would now be done away. An intercepted letter from a gentleman of Philadelphia (who has joined the enemy) to his friend and partner in the city declares that to be their de&s;ign,&mdash;that the army would be there in ten or twenty days from the &s;ixteenth in&s;tant, the time of his writing, if the ice &s;hould be made;&mdash;advi&s;es him by no means to re|move their &s;tores,&mdash;that they would be &s;afe.</P>
<P>The ob&s;tacles which have ari&s;en to the rai&s;ing of the new army, from the mode of appointing the officers, in|duce me to hope, if Congre&s;s re&s;olve on an additional num|ber of battalions to tho&s;e already voted, that they will de|vi&s;e &s;ome other rule by which the officers, e&s;pecially the
<PB N="335" REF="029737_0334_0FE24AB4DE892F38">
field-officers, &s;hould be appointed. In ca&s;e an augmentation &s;hould be made to the ea&s;tern regiments, a deviation from the former m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">de will operate more &s;trongly as to them than to other battalions, becau&s;e there have been many more officers in &s;ervice from tho&s;e States, than the regi|ments voted to be rai&s;ed would admit of; by which means &s;everal de&s;erving men could not have been provided for, had the utmo&s;t pains been u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e; and many others of merit have been neglected in the late appoint|ments, and tho&s;e of little worth and le&s;s experience put in their places or promoted over their heads. This has been the ca&s;e with many of the be&s;t officers.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed letter from the payma&s;ter-general will &s;hew the &s;tate of the military che&s;t, and the nece&s;&s;ity of a large and immediate &s;upply of ca&s;h. The advances to the officers, for bounty and the recruiting &s;ervice, are great: be&s;ides, the regiments, at the expiration of this month, will require pay of their claims. * * *</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE your obliging favours of the twenty-fir&s;t and twenty-third. The blankets are come to hand; but I would not have any of the other goods &s;ent on till you hear again from me.</P>
<P>I agree with you that it is in vain to ruminate upon, or even reflect upon the authors or cau&s;es of, our pre&s;ent mi&s;|fortunes: we &s;hould rather exert our&s;elves, and look for|ward with hopes that &s;ome lucky chance may yet turn up in our favour. Bad as our pro&s;pects are, I &s;hould not have the lea&s;t doubt of &s;ucce&s;s in the end, did not the late treach|ery and defection of tho&s;e, who &s;tood foremo&s;t in the op|po&s;ition

while fortune &s;miled upon us, make me fearful that many more will follow their example, who, by u&s;ing their influence with &s;ome and working upon the fears of others, may extend the circle &s;o as to take in whole towns, coun|ties, nay, provinces. Of this we have a recent in&s;tance in Jer&s;ey; and I wi&s;h many parts of Penn&s;ylvania may not be ready to receive the yoke.</P>
<P>The &s;ecurity of the continental &s;hips of war in Delaware is certainly a capital object; and yet to draught the many hands, nece&s;&s;ary to fit them out, from the militia, might be dangerous ju&s;t now: perhaps in a little time hence their places may be &s;upplied with country militia; and then, if the exigency of affairs requires it, they certainly ought to be &s;pared. I will ju&s;t hint to you a propo&s;ition that was made, or rather talked of, a few days ago by the officers of two New-England regiments who&s;e time of &s;ervice will expire on the fir&s;t of January. They are mo&s;t of them water men: and they &s;aid their men would willingly go on board the frigates, and navigate them round to any of the ports in New-England, if it was thought they would be &s;afer there than in Delaware. You may think of this, and let me hear from you on the &s;ubject, if the propo&s;ition plea&s;es you.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Boger of the navy is already gone in, and I have made a demand of lieutenant Jo&s;iah in exchange; but I have not heard whether lord Howe accedes to it. I will procure the relea&s;e of doctor Hodge as &s;oon as it can be done without injuring others by giving him the prefer|ence, as I have always made it a rule to demand tho&s;e fir&s;t who have been longe&s;t in captivity. I will take the &s;ame &s;teps in regard to Mr. Jones, commander of the &s;loop taken by the Andrew Doria.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take the earlie&s;t opportunity of &s;ending in your letter to general Lee, with the bill drawn upon major Small.</P>
<P>From an intercepted letter from a per&s;on in the &s;ecrets of the enemy, I find their intentions are to cro&s;s Delaware as &s;oon as the ice is &s;ufficiently &s;trong. I mention this, that you may take the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps for the &s;ecurity of &s;uch public and private property as ought not to fall into their hands &s;hould they make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Phil|adelphia, of which they do not &s;eem to entertain the lea&s;t doubt.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the plea&s;ure of congratulating you upon the &s;ucce&s;s of an enterpri&s;e which I had formed again&s;t a detachment of the enemy lying in Trenton, and which was executed ye&s;terday morning.</P>
<P>The evening of the twenty-fifth I ordered the troops in|tended for this &s;ervice to parade back of M^cKonkey's fer|ry, that they might begin to pa&s;s as &s;oon as it grew dark, imagining we &s;hould be able to throw them all over, with the nece&s;&s;ary artillery, by twelve o'clock, and that we might ea&s;ily arrive at Trenton by five in the morning, the di&s;tance being about nine miles. But the quantity of ice, made that night, impeded the pa&s;&s;age of the boats &s;o much, that it was three o'clock before the artillery could all be got over; and near four, before the troops took up their line of march.</P>
<P>This made me de&s;pair of &s;urpri&s;ing the town, as I well knew we could not reach it before the day was fairly broke. But as I was certain there was no making a retreat with|out being di&s;covered, and hara&s;&s;ed on re-pa&s;&s;ing the river, I determined to pu&s;h on at all events. I formed my de|tachment into two divi&s;ions, one to march by the lower or river road, the other by the upper or Pennington road. As the divi&s;ions had nearly the &s;ame di&s;tance to march, I ordered each of them, immediately upon forcing the out-guards, to pu&s;h directly into the town, that they might charge the enemy before they had time to form.</P>
<P>The upper divi&s;ion arrived at the enemy's advanced po&s;t exactly at eight o'clock; and in three minutes after, I found, from the fire on the lower road, that that divi&s;ion had al&s;o got up. The out-guards made but &s;mall oppo&s;i|tion, though, for their numbers, they behaved very well, keeping up a con&s;tant retreating fire from behind hou&s;es.
<PB N="338" REF="029737_0337_0FE24A70E2DDCFD0">
We pre&s;ently &s;aw their main body formed: but, from their motions, they &s;eemed undetermined how to act.</P>
<P>Being hard pre&s;&s;ed by our troops, who had already got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their artillery, they attempted to file off by a road on their right, leading to Princeton. But, perceiving their intention, I threw a body of troops in their way; which immediately checked them. Finding from our di&s;|po&s;ition, that they were &s;urrounded, and that they mu&s;t inevitably be cut to pieces if they made any further re&s;i&s;t|ance, they agreed to lay down their arms. The number that &s;ubmitted in this manner was twenty-three officers and eight hundred and eighty-&s;ix men. Colonel Rahl the commanding officer, and &s;even others, were found wound|ed in the town. I do not exactly know how many they had killed; but I fancy not above twenty or thirty, as they never made any regular &s;tand. Our lo&s;s is very trifling indeed,&mdash;only two officers and one or two privates wounded.</P>
<P>I find that the detachment of the enemy con&s;i&s;ted of the three He&s;&s;ian regiments of Lan&s;pach, Kniphau&s;en, and Rahl, amounting to about fifteen hundred men, and a troop of Briti&s;h light hor&s;e: but, immediately upon the begin|ning of the attack, all tho&s;e who were not killed or taken pu&s;hed directly down the road towards Bordentown. The&s;e would likewi&s;e have fallen into our hands, could my plan have been completely carried into execution. Gen|eral Ewing was to have cro&s;&s;ed before day at Trenton fer|ry, and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bridge leading out of town: but the quantity of ice was &s;o great, that, though he did every thing in his power to effect it, he could not get over. This difficulty al&s;o hindered general Cadwallader from cro&s;&s;ing with the Penn&s;ylvania militia from Bri&s;tol. He got part of his foot over: but finding it impo&s;&s;ible to em|bark his artillery, he was obliged to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>I am fully confident, that, could the troops under gen|erals Ewing and Cadwallader have pa&s;&s;ed the river, I &s;hould have been able with their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to have driven the ene|my from all their po&s;ts below Trenton. But the numbers I had with me being inferior to theirs below me, and a &s;trong battalion of light infantry being at Princeton above me, I thought it mo&s;t prudent to return the &s;ame evening
<PB N="339" REF="029737_0338_0FE24AB905347948">
with the pri&s;oners and the artillery we had taken. We found no &s;tores of any con&s;equence in the town.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tice to the officers and men, I mu&s;t add that their behaviour upon this occa&s;ion reflects the highe&s;t honour upon them. The difficulty of pa&s;&s;ing the river in a very &s;evere night, and their march through a violent &s;torm of &s;now and hail, did not in the lea&s;t abate their ardour: but, when they came to the charge, each &s;eemed to vie with the other in pre&s;&s;ing forward: and were I to give a prefer|ence to any particular corps, I &s;hould do great inju&s;tice to the others.</P>
<P>Colonel Baylor, my fir&s;t aide-de-camp, will have the honour of delivering this to you; and from him you may be made acquainted with many other particulars. His &s;pirited behaviour upon every occa&s;ion requires me to rec|ommend him to your particular notice.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM ju&s;t &s;etting out to attempt a &s;econd pa&s;&s;age over the Delaware with the troops that were with me on the morning of the twenty-&s;ixth. I am determined to ef|fect it if po&s;&s;ible; but know that it will be attended with much fatigue and difficulty on account of the ice, which will neither allow us to cro&s;s on foot, nor give us an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age with boats. General Cadwallader cro&s;&s;ed from Bri&s;tol on the twenty-&s;eventh, and, by his letter of ye&s;ter|day, was at Bordentown with about eighteen hundred men. In addition to the&s;e, general Mifflin &s;ent over five hundred from Philadelphia on Friday, three hundred ye&s;terday evening from Burlington, and will follow to-day with &s;even or eight hundred more. I have taken every precaution in my power for &s;ub&s;i&s;ting the troops, and &s;hall, without lo&s;s of time, and as &s;oon as circum&s;tances will admit of it, pur|&s;ue the enemy in their retreat,&mdash;try to beat up more of their quarters,&mdash;and, in a word, in every in&s;tance, adopt &s;uch mea&s;ures as the exigency of our affairs requires, and our &s;ituation will ju&s;tify.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="029737_0339_0FE24ABA887F23F0">
Had it not been for the unhappy failure of generals Ew|ing and Cadwallader in their attempts to pa&s;s on the night of the twenty-fifth,&mdash;and if the &s;everal concerted attacks could have been made,&mdash;I have no doubt but that our views would have &s;ucceeded to our warme&s;t expectations. What was done occa&s;ioned the enemy to leave their &s;everal po&s;ts on the Delaware with great precipitation. The peculiar di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which the troops who were with me were re|duced by the &s;everities of cold, rain, &s;now, and &s;torm,&mdash;the charge of the pri&s;oners they had taken,&mdash;and another rea&s;on that might be mentioned,&mdash;and the little pro&s;pect of receiving &s;uccours on account of the &s;ea&s;on and &s;itua|tion of the river,&mdash;would not authorize a further pur&s;uit at that time.</P>
<P>Since tran&s;mitting the li&s;t of pri&s;oners, a few more have been di&s;covered and taken in Trenton,&mdash;among them a lieutenant-colonel, and a deputy-adjutant-general,&mdash;the whole amounting to about a thou&s;and.</P>
<P>I have been honoured with your letter of the twenty-third and its &s;everal inclo&s;ures, to which I &s;hall pay due attention.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR re&s;olves of the twenty-&s;eventh ultimo were tran&s;|mitted me la&s;t night by me&s;&s;ieurs Clymer, Morris, and Walton. The confidence which Congre&s;s have honoured me with by the&s;e proceedings has a claim to my warme&s;t acknowledgments. At the &s;ame time I beg leave to a&s;&s;ure them, that all my faculties &s;hall be employed to direct prop|erly the powers they have been plea&s;ed to ve&s;t me with, and to advance tho&s;e objects, and only tho&s;e, which gave ri&s;e to this honourable mark of di&s;tinction. If my exer|tions &s;hould not be attended with the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s, I tru&s;t the failure will be imputed to the true cau&s;e,&mdash;the peculiarly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of our affairs, and the difficul|ties I have to combat,&mdash;rather than to a want of zeal for my country, and the clo&s;e&s;t attention to her intere&s;ts, to promote which has ever been my &s;tudy.</P>
<P>On Monday morning I pa&s;&s;ed the Delaware my&s;elf; the whole of our troops and artillery not till ye&s;terday, owing to the ice which rendered their pa&s;&s;age extremely difficult and fatiguing. Since their arrival, we have been parading the regiments who&s;e time of &s;ervice is now expired, in or|der to know what force we &s;hould have to depend on, and how to regulate our views accordingly. After much per|&s;ua&s;ion and the exertions of their officers, half or a greater proportion of tho&s;e from the ea&s;tward have con&s;ented to
<PB N="4" REF="029737_0342_0FE24AC59C3CDDD8">
&s;tay &s;ix weeks on a bounty of ten dollars. I feel the in|convenience of this advance, and I know the con&s;equences which will re&s;ult from it:&mdash;but what could be done?&mdash;Penn&s;ylvania had allowed the &s;ame to her militia:&mdash;the troops felt their importance, and would have their price. Indeed, as their aid is &s;o e&s;&s;ential, and not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with, it is to be wondered they had not e&s;timated it at a higher rate. I perceive that Congre&s;s, apprehen&s;ive of this event, had made unlimited provi&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>General Mifflin is at Bordentown with about eighteen hundred men, and general Cadwallader at Cro&s;wix's, with about the &s;ame number. We are now making our arrange|ments, and concerting a plan of operations, which I &s;hall attempt to execute as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and which I hope will be attended with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>As to the number and &s;ituation of the enemy, I cannot obtain certain intelligence: but, from the accounts mo&s;t to be relied on, they have collected the principal part of their force, from Brun&s;wic and the neighbouring po&s;ts, at Princeton, where they are throwing up &s;ome works. The number there is reported to be from five to &s;ix thou&s;and; and it is confidently &s;aid they have &s;ent the chief part of their baggage to Brun&s;wic. It is added that general Howe landed at Amboy a day or two ago with a thou&s;and light troops, and is on his march from thence.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour to inform you, that, &s;ince the date of my la&s;t from Trenton, I have removed with the army under my command to this place. The difficulty of cro&s;&s;|ing the Delaware on account of the ice made our pa&s;&s;age over it tedious, and gave the enemy an opportunity of draw|ing in their &s;everal cantonments, and a&s;&s;embling their whole force at Princeton. Their large picquets, advanced to|wards Trenton,&mdash;their great preparations, and &s;ome intel|ligence I had received,&mdash;added to their knowledge that the fir&s;t of January brought on a di&s;&s;olution of the be&s;t part of our army,&mdash;gave me the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons to conclude that an attack upon us was meditating.</P>
<P>Our &s;ituation was mo&s;t critical, and our force &s;mall. To remove immediately was again de&s;troying every dawn of hope which had begun to revive in the brea&s;ts of the Jer&s;ey militia; and to bring tho&s;e troops which had fir&s;t cro&s;&s;ed the Delaware and were lying at Cro&s;wix's under general Cadwallader, and tho&s;e under general Mifflin at Bordentown, (amounting in the whole to about three thou|&s;and &s;ix hundred) to Trenton, was to bring them to an expo&s;ed place. One or the other however was unavoida|ble: the latter was preferred, and they were ordered to join us at Trenton, which they did, by a night-march on the fir&s;t in&s;tant.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd, according to my expectation, the enemy began to advance upon us; and, after &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hing, the head of their column reached Trenton about four o'clock, whil&s;t their rear was as far back as Maidenhead. They attempted to pa&s;s Sanpink creek which runs through Tren|ton, at different places; but, finding the fords guarded, halted, and kindled their fires. We were drawn up on the other &s;ide of the creek. In this &s;ituation we remain|ed till dark, cannonading the enemy, and receiving the fire of their field pieces, which did us but little damage.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="029737_0344_0FE24AC71E25A6C0">
Having by this time di&s;covered that the enemy were greatly &s;uperior in number, and that their de&s;ign was to &s;urround us, I ordered all our baggage to be removed &s;ilent|ly to Burlington &s;oon after dark; and at twelve o'clock, after renewing our fires, and leaving guards at the bridge in Trenton, and other pa&s;&s;es on the &s;ame &s;tream above, marched by a round-about road to Princeton, where I knew they could not have much force left, and might have &s;tores. One thing I was certain of, that it would avoid the ap|pearance of a retreat, (which was of cour&s;e,&mdash;or to run the hazard of the whole army being cut off) whil&s;t we might by a fortunate &s;troke withdraw general Howe from Tren|ton, and give &s;ome reputation to our arms. Happily we &s;ucceeded. We found Princeton about &s;un-ri&s;e with only three regiments, and three troops of light-hor&s;e in it, two of which were on their march to Trenton. The&s;e three regiments, e&s;pecially the two fir&s;t, made a gallant re&s;i&s;tance, and, in killed, wounded, and pri&s;oners, mu&s;t have lo&s;t five hundred men: upwards of one hundred of them were left dead in the field; and, with what I have with me and what were taken in the pur&s;uit and carried acro&s;s the Del|aware, there are near three hundred pri&s;oners, fourteen of whom are officers, all Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>This piece of good fortune is counterbalanced by the lo&s;s of the brave and worthy general Mercer, colonels Haz|let and Potter, captain Neal of the artillery, captain Flem|ing who commanded the fir&s;t Virginia regiment, and four or five other valuable officers, who, with about twenty-five or thirty privates, were &s;lain in the field. Our whole lo&s;s cannot be a&s;certained, as many who were in pur&s;uit of the enemy (who were cha&s;ed three or four miles) are not yet come in.</P>
<P>The rear of the enemy's army lying at Maidenhead (not more than five or &s;ix miles from Princeton) was up with us before our pur&s;uit was over: but as I had the precaution to de&s;troy the bridge over Stoney-brook, (about half a mile from the field of action) they were &s;o long retarded there as to give us time to move off in good order for this place. We took two bra&s;s field-pieces; but, for want of hor&s;es, could not bring them away. We al&s;o took &s;ome blankets, &s;hoes, and a few other trifling articles, burned the
<PB N="7" REF="029737_0345_0FE24B1AC14A71C0">
hay, and de&s;troyed &s;uch other things as the &s;hortne&s;s of the time would admit of.</P>
<P>My original plan, when I &s;et out from Trenton, was, to have pu&s;hed on to Brun&s;wic: but the hara&s;&s;ed &s;tate of our troops, (many of them having had no re&s;t for two nights and a day) and the danger of lo&s;ing the advantage we had gained by aiming at too much, induced me, by the advice of my officers, to relinqui&s;h the attempt: but, in my judg|ment, &s;ix or eight hundred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e&s;h troops upon a forced march would have de&s;troyed all their &s;tores and magazines,&mdash;taken (as we have &s;ince learned) their military che&s;t, containing &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds,&mdash;and put an end to the war. The enemy, from the be&s;t intelligence I have been able to get, were &s;o much alarmed at the apprehen&s;ion of this, that they marched immediately to Brun&s;wic without halting, except at the bridges, (for I al&s;o took up tho&s;e on Mill&s;tone, on the dffierent routes to Brun&s;wic) and got there before day.</P>
<P>From the be&s;t information I have received, general Howe has left no men either at Trenton or Princeton. The truth of this I am endeavouring to a&s;certain, that I may regulate my movements accordingly.</P>
<P>The militia are taking &s;pirits, and, I am told, are coming in fa&s;t from this State: but I fear tho&s;e from Philadelphia will &s;carcely &s;ubmit to the hard&s;hips of a winter campaign much longer, e&s;pecially as they very unluckily &s;ent their blankets with their baggage to Burlington. I mu&s;t do them the ju&s;tice however to add, that they have undergone more fatigue and hard&s;hip, than I expected militia (e&s;pecially cit|izens) would have done at this inclement &s;ea&s;on. I am ju&s;t moving to Morri&s;town, where I &s;hall endeavour to put them under the be&s;t cover I can:&mdash;hitherto we have been with|out any; and many of our poor &s;oldiers quite barefoot, and ill clad in other re&s;pects.</P>

<P>I AM happy to inform you that the account of gen|eral Mercer's death, tran&s;mitted in my la&s;t, was premature, though it was mentioned as certain by many who &s;aw him
<PB N="8" REF="029737_0346_0FE24AC9B4582580">
after he was wounded. By intelligence from Princeton ye&s;|terday evening, he was alive, and &s;eemed as if he would do well:&mdash;unhappily he is a pri&s;oner. Had it not been for the information I had of his death, I would have tried to have brought him away, though I believe it could not have been effected.</P>
<P>The enemy have totally evacuated Trent and Prince towns, and are now at Brun&s;wic and the &s;everal po&s;ts on the communication between that and Hud&s;on's river, but chiefly at Brun&s;wic. Their numbers and movements are variou&s;ly reported: but all agree that their force is great. There have been two or three little &s;kirmi&s;hes between their parties and &s;ome detachments of militia, in which the latter have been &s;ucce&s;sful, and made a few pri&s;oners. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable was on Sunday morning near Springfield, when eight or ten Waldeckers were killed and wounded, and the remainder of the party (thirty-nine or forty) made pri&s;oners, with two officers, by a force not &s;uperior in number, and without receiving the lea&s;t damage.</P>
<P>The &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on has made our troops, e&s;pecially the militia, extremely impatient, and has reduced the num|ber very con&s;iderably. Every day more or le&s;s leave us. Their complaints, and the great fatigues they had undergone, induced me to come to this place, as the be&s;t calculated of any in this quarter to accommodate and refre&s;h them. The &s;ituation is by no means favourable to our views; and, as &s;oon as the purpo&s;es are an&s;wered for which we came, I think to remove, though I confe&s;s I do not know how we &s;hall procure covering for our men el&s;ewhere.</P>

<P>I AM honoured with yours of the &s;ixth, inclo&s;ing &s;ev|eral re&s;olves of Congre&s;s re&s;pecting an exchange to be pro|po&s;ed between general Lee and the He&s;&s;ian field-officers taken at Trenton. Colonel Ralle died the day after the action; and we left one of the majors &s;o ill of his wounds, that I am in doubt of his recovery. I can however make a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> offer of all that remain, in exchange for general Lee, except one whom you order to be propo&s;ed for colonel Allen. If the offer is rejected by general Howe, I &s;hall think my&s;elf then at liberty to remon&s;trate to him on his treatment of general Lee. If he will not exchange him, he &s;hould at lea&s;t admit him to his parole, as we have ever done their pri&s;oners who have fallen into our hands.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand from undoubted authority that they intend to try the general by a court-martial, as a de&s;erter from their &s;ervice, pretending that his re&s;ignation was never accepted of. But I &s;hall inform general Howe, that, if any &s;uch &s;tep is taken under &s;o &s;hallow and illegal a pretext, and their &s;entence &s;hould extend either to affect his life or liberty, they may depend upon the mo&s;t &s;evere and adequate retali|ation upon our part.</P>
<P>The enemy have made no move &s;ince my la&s;t. By every account, they begin to be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, particularly for forage, of which there is little or none remaining in the &s;mall circle they po&s;&s;e&s;s, except &s;alt hay.</P>

<P>I EMBRACE this opportunity, by Mr. Hopkins, of informing you that the enemy remain upon their old ground at Amboy and Brun&s;wic.

<P>General Warner, with two regiments from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, is arrived here: general Heath, with the remainder of the troops from that State, has by this time begun to move down towards King&s;bridge.</P>

<P>I HAVE not had the honour of any of your favours &s;ince I wrote to you on the fourteenth in&s;tant.&mdash;No material alterations have happened in this quarter. The enemy, from every account, mean to make Brun&s;wic their advanc|ed po&s;t for this winter. They are endeavouring to draw in all the forage they can get; in the cour&s;e of which, they have daily &s;kirmi&s;hes with our advanced parties: but I think, do what they will, they mu&s;t be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed greatly before the winter is over.</P>
<P>By a late re&s;olve of Congre&s;s, the towns of Carli&s;le in Penn&s;ylvania, and Brookfield in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, are fixed upon for the proper places to erect elaboratories, and lay

up magazines of military &s;tores. Upon communicating this re&s;olve to general Knox, who will have the principal direction of the&s;e matters, he was of opinion that Hartford in Connecticut would be on many accounts more conve|nient for that purpo&s;e than Brookfield, particularly in re|&s;pect to buildings, which are already erected, and, though not &s;uch as are immediately fit for the u&s;es they are intend|ed, may be ea&s;ily converted to them.&mdash;General Knox, and others whom I have con&s;ulted upon the occa&s;ion, al&s;o think that Yorktown will be full as &s;afe, and more convenient than Carli&s;le.&mdash;If the&s;e two alterations &s;hould, upon a re|con&s;ideration, appear to you in the &s;ame light, and no &s;teps &s;hould have been taken towards carrying matters into exe|cution, I &s;hould be glad that you would, by a new re&s;olve, permit me to direct the works to be carried on at the places la&s;t mentioned.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE fluctuating &s;tate of an army compo&s;ed chiefly of militia bids fair to reduce us to the &s;ituation in which we were &s;ome little time ago,&mdash;that is, of &s;carce having any ar|my at all,&mdash;except reinforcements &s;peedily arrive. One of the battalions from the city of Philadelphia goes home to|day,&mdash;and the other two only remain a few days longer upon courte&s;y. The time for which a country brigade un|der general Mifflin came out is expired, and they &s;tay from day to day by dint of &s;olicitation,&mdash;their numbers much reduced by de&s;ertions. We have about eight hundred of the ea&s;tern continental troops remaining of twelve or four|teen hundred who at fir&s;t agreed to &s;tay,&mdash;part engaged to the la&s;t of this month, and part to the middle of next. The five Virginia regiments are reduced to a handful of men, as are colonel Hand's, Smallwood's, and the German battalion. A few days ago general Warner arrived with
<PB N="12" REF="029737_0350_0FE24AD45CCAC9E0">
about &s;even hundred Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts militia engaged to the fifteenth of March.</P>
<P>Thus you have a &s;ketch of our pre&s;ent army, with which we are obliged to keep up appearances before an enemy already double to us in numbers, and who from every ac|count are withdrawing their troops from Rhode-I&s;land, to form a junction of their whole army, and make another at|tempt either to break up ours, or penetrate towards Phila|delphia,&mdash;a thing by no means difficult now, as the ice af|fords an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age over the Delaware.</P>
<P>I do not yet know what effect general Heath's moving down towards New-York will have. Ye&s;terday morning a con&s;iderable firing was heard, which &s;eemed to be about King&s;bridge. I am in hopes that his appearance on that quarter with a pretty large force will oblige them to with|draw part of theirs from Jer&s;ey, to &s;ecure the city of New-York, which, by late accounts, is weakly garri&s;oned. Gen|eral Heath has all the ea&s;tern and York militia with him, except the &s;mall brigade under general Warner that I men|tioned before, one regiment of Connecticut, &s;topped at Providence in Rhode-I&s;land, and a number (how many I do not know) reque&s;ted by general Schuyler to be &s;ent to Ticonderoga.&mdash;If it &s;hould appear that they are regardle&s;s of the diver&s;ion made by general Heath, and per&s;i&s;t in their plan of drawing their whole army together in Jer&s;ey, I mu&s;t order him over with all his troops, except as many as are nece&s;&s;ary to garri&s;on the forts and guard the pa&s;&s;es in the Highlands.</P>
<P>I have ordered away every officer that could be &s;pared, &s;ome to recruit, and &s;ome to collect the &s;cattered men of the different regiments, who are di&s;per&s;ed almo&s;t over the con|tinent: for, of the va&s;t numbers &s;ent to the ho&s;pitals at different times, few ever returned after they got well.</P>
<P>As militia mu&s;t be our dependence till we can get the new army rai&s;ed and properly arranged, I mu&s;t entreat you to continue your endeavours with the States of Penn&s;ylva|nia, Maryland and Virginia to turn out every man they po&s;&s;ibly can, and for &s;ome longer time than they generally have &s;tipulated for. If they agree for a month or any lim|ited time, it &s;hould commence from the time they actually join the army, and not from the time they leave their
<PB N="13" REF="029737_0351_0FE24B27CEBFFC58">
homes: otherwi&s;e the marching backwards and forwards con&s;umes the term of engagement.</P>
<P>I think the&s;e demands of aid &s;hould be made as quietly as the nature of the ca&s;e will admit of, e&s;pecially at this time when we are deceiving our enemies with fal&s;e opinions of our numbers: for, to boa&s;t of our &s;uperiority in that re&s;pect on one hand, and to call publickly on the people for a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance on the other, is an impropriety too glaring:&mdash;indeed it has been already noticed in &s;ome publications that I have &s;een from New-York.</P>

<P>I AM favoured with yours of the fifteenth in&s;tant, with the &s;undry re&s;olves inclo&s;ed in it. If that re&s;pecting the continental currency is carried &s;trictly into execution, it cannot fail of fully re-e&s;tabli&s;hing its credit.</P>
<P>I have no objection to the three gentlemen who are recommended for field-officers in the New-Hamp&s;hire regi|ment; they &s;eem fully entitled to it, as they have rai&s;ed the regiment. I will furni&s;h them with commi&s;&s;ions from the date of their appointment, when applied to for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething particular in the application of colonel Dubois and his officers for the &s;um of five hundred and thirteen dollars and two thirds. They were to have been commi&s;&s;ioned provided they could rai&s;e the men; but, from their own pay-ab&s;tract, it appears that fourteen officers only brought twenty-five men into the field. As they certainly did not comply with their agreement, I would, after &s;tating the matter as it really was, &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s who have the di&s;po&s;al of the public money.</P>
<P>I have peru&s;ed the petition of mon&s;ieur Faneuil and other French gentlemen. If they could rai&s;e &s;uch a regiment as they propo&s;e, it would certainly be u&s;eful: but I have no conception that there are Canadians enough to be found even for a regiment of the common number, much le&s;s of two thou&s;and three hundred and forty-&s;even, which is the number propo&s;ed. I know, neither colonel Living&s;ton nor colonel Hazen could ever complete their Canadian regi|ments
<PB N="14" REF="029737_0352_0FE24AD5E054EAA0">
when they had the country open to them. As I would give encouragement to foreigners of real merit, I would put the thing upon this footing:&mdash;if mon&s;ieur Faneuil can procure a &s;ufficient number of officers to fill a regiment of the common &s;ize, and they can give any a&s;&s;ur|ances of being able to rai&s;e the men, I would grant them commi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to remark here, that, except we can throw the many foreigners who have commi&s;&s;ions in our army into a corps together, they will be entirely u&s;ele&s;s, as they can neither conver&s;e with officers nor men in any other kind of regiment.</P>
<P>I am &s;o well a&s;&s;ured that you would not recommend doctor Potts to &s;ucceed doctor Stringer in the northern de|partment except you had &s;ufficient proof of his abilities in the medical line, that I readily concur with you in the ap|pointment.</P>
<P>I have received a piece of information which I am afraid is true,&mdash;and that is, that the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers have taken a French ve&s;&s;el, with a large parcel of cannon and mortars on board. I know &s;uch a one was expected, and therefore more readily credit the account.</P>

<P>MY la&s;t to you was on the twentieth in&s;tant. Since that, I have the plea&s;ure to inform you that general Dick|in&s;on, with about four hundred militia, has defeated a for|aging party of the enemy of an equal number, and has taken forty waggons, and upwards of a hundred hor&s;es, mo&s;t of them of the Engli&s;h draft breed, and a number of &s;heep and cattle which they had collected. The enemy retreated with &s;o much precipitation, that general Dickin&s;on had on|ly an opportunity of making nine pri&s;oners. They were ob&s;erved to carry off a good many dead and wounded in light waggons.&mdash;This action happened near Somer&s;et court|hou&s;e on Mill&s;tone river. General Dickin&s;on's behaviour reflects the highe&s;t honour upon him: for, though his troops were all raw, he led them through the river middle-deep,

and gave the enemy &s;o &s;evere a charge, that, although &s;upported by three field-pieces, they gave way and left their convoy.</P>
<P>I have not heard from general Heath &s;ince the &s;iring near King&s;bridge la&s;t Saturday; which I cannot account for, un|le&s;s the North-river &s;hould have been rendered impa&s;&s;able by the ice. But the account of his having &s;urpri&s;ed and taken Fort-Independence on Friday night la&s;t comes &s;o well au|thenticated by different ways, that I cannot doubt it. It is &s;aid that he took four hundred pri&s;oners in that fort, and that he inve&s;ted Fort-Wa&s;hington on Saturday, which oc|ca&s;ioned the &s;iring. This is brought out by three of our officers who made their e&s;cape from New-York on Sunday, and is confirmed by a &s;py who went into Amboy, who &s;ays an expre&s;s had arrived at Amboy from New-York, with an account of the lo&s;s of Fort-Independence, and calling for a reinforcement to protect the city; in con&s;e|quence of which, a number of troops had gone over. I have &s;ent in &s;pies to Brun&s;wic and Amboy to know the truth of this: and if it appears that they have weakened them&s;elves to reinforce New-York, I &s;hall probably make &s;ome attempt upon them, if we have men enough left to do it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be glad to know what &s;tock of &s;mall-arms you at pre&s;ent have, and what are your expectations &s;hortly. The nece&s;&s;ity that we have been and are now under, of calling in and arming the militia, &s;catters our armory all over the world, in a manner: their officers are &s;o irregular that they generally &s;uffer their men to carry home every thing that is put into their hands, which is forever lo&s;t to the public. The new-rai&s;ed regiments will call for a great number of arms; and I do not at pre&s;ent &s;ee how they are to be &s;upplied.</P>
<P>I would again beg leave to recall the attention of Congre&s;s to the appointment of general officers. I will not &s;uppo&s;e the nomination of them is po&s;tponed upon a &s;aving principle, becau&s;e the advantage in having proper officers to examine the pay-rolls of their &s;everal regiments, and compare them with the returns of their brigades,&mdash;to &s;ee that the regiments are provided with what is proper, and that no more than a &s;ufficiency is allowed,&mdash;to keep officers to their duty, and not, while the &s;pirited officer is encountering all the fatigues
<PB N="16" REF="029737_0354_0FE24AD764627BD0">
and hard&s;hips of a rigorous campaign, &s;uffer a number of others, under various frivolous pretences and imaginary &s;ick|ne&s;&s;es, to enjoy them&s;elves at the public expen&s;e at their own fire&s;ides;&mdash;I &s;ay, if the appointments are withheld upon par|&s;imonious principles, the Congre&s;s are mi&s;taken: for I am convinced, that, by the correction of many abu&s;es which it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to attend to, the public will be benefited in a great degree in the article of expen&s;e. But this is not all. We have a very little time to do a very great work in. The arranging, providing for, and di&s;ciplining a hundred and odd battalions is not to be accompli&s;hed in a day; nor is it to be done at all with any degree of propriety, when we have once entered upon the active part of the campaign. The&s;e duties mu&s;t be branched out, or they will be neglected, and the public injured. Be&s;ides, were the brigadiers appointed, they might be facilitating the recruiting &s;ervice; they would have time to get a little acquainted with their brigades, the wants of them, and ea&s;e me of the great weight and burden which I at pre&s;ent feel.</P>
<P>On whom the choice will or ought to light, I cannot un|dertake to &s;ay. In a former letter I took the liberty of &s;ubmitting to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s the propriety of appointing, out of each State, brigadiers to command the troops of that State,&mdash;thinking, as a di&s;tinction is now fix|ed, a &s;pirit of emulation might ari&s;e by this means. At any rate, I &s;hall take the liberty of recommending general Cad|wallader as one of the fir&s;t for the new appointments. I have found him a man of ability, a good di&s;ciplinarian, firm in his principles, and of intrepid bravery. I &s;hall al&s;o beg leave to recommend colonel Reed to the command of the hor&s;e, as a per&s;on, in my opinion, every way qualified: for he is extremely active and enterpri&s;ing; many &s;ignal proofs of which he has given this campaign. For the re&s;t, the members of Congre&s;s can judge better than I can: I can only &s;ay, that, as the army will probably be divided in the cour&s;e of the next campaign, there ought, in my opinion, to be three lieutenant-generals, nine major-generals, and twen|ty &s;even brigadiers:&mdash;in other words, there ought, at lea&s;t, to be a brigadier to every four regiments, and a major-gen|eral to every three brigades. The lieutenant-generals will, I pre&s;ume, be appointed out of the olde&s;t major-generals, and
<PB N="17" REF="029737_0355_0FE24B2B1A59CDC8">
the major-generals from the olde&s;t brigadiers. Nine briga|diers will then be to nominate.</P>
<P>I forgot before this to inform Congre&s;s, that, including the regiment of light dragoons from Virginia, and colonel Shel|don's to be rai&s;ed in Connecticut, I have only commi&s;&s;ion|ed officers for four regiments. I was willing to try how the&s;e could be equipped before I put more officers into commi&s;&s;ion. It is apprehended we &s;hall find difficulty in providing nece&s;|&s;aries or even hor&s;es for the&s;e four regiments: if we &s;hould not, I &s;hall immediately &s;et about the re&s;idue. Colonel Baylor, colonel Moylan, (who, as volunteer, has remained con&s;tantly with the army &s;ince his di&s;continuance in the quarter-ma&s;ter's department) and colonel Sheldon, com|mand the three new regiments of light dragoons.</P>
<P>The trea&s;ury has been for &s;ome time empty, and the army has laboured under the greate&s;t inconvenience for want of money. The recruiting &s;ervice is particularly injured by this, as many officers are now waiting only for bounty-money. I have al&s;o complaints from the ea&s;tward, of the want of money to carry on their recruiting &s;ervice. If we are not &s;upplied with that nece&s;&s;ary article, all matters mu&s;t be at a &s;tand. I mu&s;t therefore beg, that, if Mr. Palfrey has not been already &s;upplied with a large &s;um, it may be done with the utmo&s;t expedition, and that you will endeav|our to keep up the &s;upply by con&s;tantly &s;ending on &s;maller parcels.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS la&s;t night honoured with yours of the eigh|teenth in&s;tant, inclo&s;ing a letter from the State of New-York to Congre&s;s. From the particular &s;ituation of their State in regard to their being totally deprived of commerce, they cer|tainly mu&s;t &s;tand in need of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other States to provide them with clothing and every thing nece&s;&s;ary for the equipment of their forces; and it ever was my intention
<PB N="18" REF="029737_0356_0FE24AE0AA87F080">
to allow them a full proportion of the clothing purcha&s;ed to the ea&s;tward, whenever it came to hand. Little or none of it has yet reached this army, though in the greate&s;t want, and expo&s;ed to the &s;everities of a winter campaign.</P>
<P>The convention have in one in&s;tance already provided for them&s;elves out of the public &s;tock, by &s;topping and making u&s;e of twenty-&s;ix bales of clothing coming on from the ea&s;t|ward to the army here. As this was done without con&s;ult|ing me, I took the liberty of de&s;iring them not to do the like in future; not that I meant to deprive them of their &s;hare, but becau&s;e it di&s;appointed me of many articles which I &s;tood in immediate want of, and had not provided from other quarters. But you may be a&s;&s;ured, that, whenever returns are made of the whole &s;tock of clothing, they &s;hall have their proportion, and more than that,&mdash;allowance for their peculiar &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I am amazed to hear complaints of the ho&s;pital on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's-river. Doctor Morgan, with mo&s;t of his mates, has been con&s;tantly there &s;ince I left it with the main body of the army. It is in vain however to look back upon pa&s;t misfortunes. I will not pretend to point out the cau&s;es; but I know matters have been &s;trangely conducted in the medical line. I hope your new appointment, when it is made, will make the nece&s;&s;ary reform in the ho&s;pital, and that I &s;hall not, the next campaign, have my ears, and eyes too, &s;hocked with the complaints and looks of poor creatures peri&s;hing for want of proper care, either in the regimental or ho&s;pital &s;urgeons.</P>
<P>I agree with the convention in the expediency of ob|&s;tructing the pa&s;&s;age of the North-river in &s;ome place be|tween the mouth and the Highlands. We have found that our labour and expen&s;e has been thrown away in endeavour|ing to do it below, where the channel is amazingly wide and deep; but, from the &s;light view I have had of the river above, I think the pa&s;&s;age may be ea&s;ily ob&s;tructed, and de|fended by proper fortifications, as the river is &s;o narrow that no ve&s;&s;el going up could po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape the fire. I am no judge of what can be done towards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itting out the frigates at Poughkeep&s;ie:&mdash;that mu&s;t be left to the gentlemen of the marine committee.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="029737_0357_0FE24B2C9CA17F90">
The hint given by the convention of New-York, of the nece&s;&s;ity and utility of a commi&s;&s;ary of forage, had &s;truck me before, and had been mentioned by general Mif|flin, who&s;e department of quarter-ma&s;ter-general mu&s;t be ea&s;ed of part of the load which is at pre&s;ent thrown upon it. He is obliged in many in&s;tances to act entirely out of his proper line; and, in&s;tead of being confined to the duty of quarter-ma&s;ter-general, is al&s;o waggon-ma&s;ter, and forage-ma&s;ter-general.&mdash;I have wrote to two per&s;ons that I think qualified to fill the office of waggon-ma&s;ter; and I hope one of them will accept.&mdash;That of commi&s;&s;ary of forage &s;hall be attended to.</P>
<P>The want of accurate maps of the country which has hitherto been the &s;cene of war, has been of great di&s;advan|tage to me. I have in vain endeavoured to procure them, and have been obliged to make &s;hift with &s;uch &s;ketches as I could trace out from my own ob&s;ervation and that of gen|tlemen around me. I really think, if gentlemen of known character and probity could be employed in making maps (from actual &s;urvey) of the roads,&mdash;the rivers, and bridges and fords over them,&mdash;the mountains, and pa&s;&s;es through them&mdash;it would be of the greate&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>I had, previous to the receipt of your letter, wrote to gene|ral Howe, and propo&s;ed the fixing an agent for pri&s;oners at New-York. I have not received an an&s;wer: but if he ac|cedes to the propo&s;al, I &s;hall appoint Mr. Lewis Pintard.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry that I am obliged to contradict the report of the taking of Fort-Independence as mentioned in my la&s;t. I believe the evacuation of &s;ome detached redoubts gave ri&s;e to the report.&mdash;I have not heard from general Heath &s;ince the fourteenth in&s;tant, which I am amazed at. I am quite in the dark as to his numbers, and what progre&s;s he has made.</P>
<P>On the twenty-third, a party of four hundred of our men, under colonel * * *, fell in with two regiments of the enemy, convoying a number of waggons from Brun&s;wic to Amboy. Our advanced party under colonel Parker en|gaged them with great bravery upwards of twenty minutes, during which time the colonel-commandant was killed, and the &s;econd in command mortally wounded. The people living near the field of action &s;ay their killed and wounded
<PB N="20" REF="029737_0358_0FE24AE250BFB070">
were con&s;iderable. We lo&s;t only two men, who were made pri&s;oners. Had colonel * * * come up with the main body, colonel Parker and the other officers think we &s;hould have put them to the rout, as their confu&s;ion was very great, and their ground di&s;advantageous. I have ordered * * * under arre&s;t, and &s;hall bring him to trial to an&s;wer for &s;o extraordinary a piece of conduct.</P>
<P>Reinforcements come up &s;o extremely &s;low, that I am afraid I &s;hall be left without any men before they arrive: The enemy mu&s;t be ignorant of our numbers, or they have not hor&s;es to move their artillery, or they would not &s;uffer us to remain undi&s;turbed. I have repeatedly wrote to all the recruiting officers, to forward on their men as fa&s;t as they could arm and clothe them; but they are &s;o extremely aver&s;e to turning out of comfortable quarters, that I cannot get a man to come near me, though I hear from all parts that the recruiting &s;ervice goes on with great &s;ucce&s;s. It would be well if the board of war, in who&s;e department it is, would i&s;&s;ue orders for all officers to equip and forward their re|cruits to Head-Quarters with the greate&s;t expedition.</P>
<P>By a re&s;olve of Congre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time ago, general Schuyler is directed to apply to me for ninety-four tons of powder&mdash;a quantity which it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould have by me, and for which I do not know where to direct him to apply. I could wi&s;h that returns were made to me of the quantity of powder on hand, and where it is to be found, that I may not be at a lo&s;s at any time of emergency.</P>
<P>Since the re&s;ignation of colonel Reed, the important of|fice of adjutant-general has been left unfilled, (I mean as to a principal) and I am much at a lo&s;s how or where to find a per&s;on in every way capable and proper to execute the of|fice. My inclinations lead me to confer the appointment upon a major Morris: but ample te&s;timonials &s;hould be pro|duced, and full proof of fidelity ought to be made, before an office of &s;o high tru&s;t &s;hould be conferred upon a per&s;on in a manner a &s;tranger to me. I only know major Morris from a &s;hort per&s;onal acquaintance, and from report: he never even brought a letter of recommendation to me. From his conver&s;ation, and from the accounts I have received from others, he is a man of con&s;iderable military abilities; and, from his behaviour in two in&s;tances, he is a man of
<PB N="21" REF="029737_0359_0FE24B36767ECE40">
bravery and conduct. His &s;tory is &s;imply this&mdash;that he left the Briti&s;h &s;ervice in di&s;gu&s;t upon not receiving a promotion to which he was ju&s;tly entitled. Perhaps &s;ome gentlemen of Congre&s;s may know more about him, or may be able to make &s;uch inquiries as might &s;atisfy them as to the &s;afety and propriety of appointing him. I have no other motive for wi&s;hing him a preference than that I think him the prop|ere&s;t per&s;on that has come under my notice, provided all matters before mentioned were cleared up. I &s;hall wait the re&s;ult of a determination of Congre&s;s before I proceed fur|ther in this appointment: and I wi&s;h to be favoured with their advice as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible; for the remains of the old army is much di&s;arranged for want of a good adjutant-general, and the formation of the new in a great mea&s;ure depends upon an able officer in that line.</P>

<P>I HAVE none of your favours unan&s;wered at pre&s;ent. There is &s;uch a demand upon me from all quarters for money, which I am unable to an&s;wer, that I cannot help again pre&s;&s;ing you to &s;end on a &s;upply. The recruiting &s;er|vice is almo&s;t at a &s;top here for want of money; and gov|ernor Trumbull writes me word that it is totally &s;o in Con|necticut. He adds that their loan officers cannot proceed in their bu&s;ine&s;s for want of proper check-books and notes; but that, if they were furni&s;hed with them, they could &s;oon take in a &s;ufficient quantity to an&s;wer their purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be glad to be informed whether I have a right to draw warrants upon the loan-officers in the different States. The State of Connecticut advanced colonel Sheldon, at my reque&s;t, ten thou&s;and pounds lawful, to rai&s;e his regi|ment of hor&s;e. For their reimbur&s;ement they de&s;ired me to give them a draught upon the loan-office: but, not know|ing whether I had a right to draw upon that fund, I deferred it till I heard from you.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg you to write to the a&s;&s;emblies of the different States, and in&s;i&s;t upon their pa&s;&s;ing a law to inflict a &s;evere and heavy penalty upon tho&s;e who harbour de&s;erters, know|ing
<PB N="22" REF="029737_0360_0FE24AE3D286E798">
them to be &s;uch. Our army is &s;hamefully reduced by de&s;ertion; and, except the people in the country can be forced to give information when de&s;erters return to their old neighbourhoods, we &s;hall be obliged to detach one half of the army to bring back the other.</P>
<P>I have a letter from general Heath, of the twenty-fourth in&s;tant. He was at and near King&s;bridge with his army. I do not find that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e is likely to do more than to draw the attention of the enemy that way, and to cut them off from forage, of which they are in great wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with yours of the twenty-fourth of January, with &s;undry re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, and a peti|tion of mon&s;ieur Pelli&s;ier's inclo&s;ed. I am not the proper <HI>[per&s;on]</HI> to refer the petition to, as I am no judge of his merit as an engineer, having never had an opportunity of &s;eeing any of his performances. At any rate I do not &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of appointing him or any other per&s;on principal engineer at Ticonderoga: for that would exclude any other, though of &s;uperior abilities, from being &s;ent there. Be&s;ides, as a corps of engineers will in all probability be &s;oon e&s;tab|li&s;hed, mon&s;ieur Pelli&s;ier's rank can then be &s;ettled with more propriety.</P>
<P>I forgot to mention in any of my former letters that I had appointed captain Nathaniel Gue&s;t, of Virginia, to the command of a regiment to be rai&s;ed upon the frontiers of Virginia and Carolina; and I have directed him, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring a company or two of Cherokee Indians. If they can be procured, they will an&s;wer two valuable purpo&s;es&mdash;one, as excellent &s;couts&mdash;the other, that they will be in fact ho&s;tages, and will &s;ecure the good behaviour of their nation.</P>
<P>Major Bland, commandant of the Virginia hor&s;e, has de|&s;ired to know whether there is not a nece&s;&s;ity of giving a bounty and re-enli&s;ting his regiment as continental troops. They were enli&s;ted to &s;erve in the colony; and the men
<PB N="23" REF="029737_0361_0FE24B37FABB2030">
were with &s;ome difficulty prevailed upon to march hither: but the major thinks they would be entirely reconciled upon receiving the bounty.</P>
<P>I received a letter from Mr. Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e, de&s;iring I would ap|point proper per&s;ons to make inquiry into and take depo&s;i|tions concerning the behaviour of the Briti&s;h and foreign troops in Jer&s;ey. This would be an endle&s;s ta&s;k, as their line of march is marked with deva&s;tation, and is a thing of &s;uch public notoriety that it demands no further proof.</P>
<P>I remon&s;trated with general Howe upon the treatment of our wounded at Princeton. You will &s;ee by the inclo&s;ed letter from him, that he di&s;avows and dete&s;ts the proceed|ing: but I fear that too much encouragement is given to &s;uch barbarous behaviour by the Briti&s;h officers; for, in a late &s;kirmi&s;h in which Sir William Er&s;kine commanded, lieutenant Kelly of the fifth Virginia regiment was flightly wounded in the thigh; but, before he could get off the field, he was overtaken and murdered in a mo&s;t cruel manner. General Stephen informed me that he would write to Sir William, and inform him, that, unle&s;s &s;uch practices were put a &s;top to, our &s;oldiers would not be re&s;trained from making retaliation.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Heath, of the thirteenth of la&s;t month, I find that he had decamped from the neighbour|hood of King&s;bridge, and removed back towards the White-Plains. His rea&s;ons for doing &s;o were, that the troops could not &s;tand the inclemency of the weather, and that he feared the troops expected from Rhode-I&s;land would land upon his back. I have however directed him to leave a body of light troops under an active officer, in order to hara&s;s their foraging parties, and to cover our own who are to remove as much of the forage from We&s;t-Che&s;ter county as they can; and, after leaving as many men as will &s;ecure the pa&s;&s;es in the Highlands, the remainder are to be &s;ent over here to join me; for I am apprehen&s;ive that the enemy are reinforc|ing them&s;elves at Brun&s;wic.</P>
<P>I &s;hall to-morrow &s;end out parties from every quarter, to remove all the waggons, hor&s;es, cattle and &s;heep, or as many as po&s;&s;ible, from the neighbourhood of the enemy's lines. They are to attend particularly to the hor&s;es: for if we can reduce tho&s;e that they at pre&s;ent have, and can hinder them
<PB N="24" REF="029737_0362_0FE24AE5558B2AD0">
from getting fre&s;h ones from the adjacent country, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for them to move their artillery and waggons forward, &s;hould they incline to make another pu&s;h towards Philadelphia.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve by your la&s;t re&s;olves that the militia of Balti|more, Harford and Cecil counties in Maryland, are order|ed out and to march this way. Let me entreat you to &s;uf|fer none to go forward to Philadelphia but what are equip|ped with arms, accoutrements and blankets: they hurt the &s;ervice much by taking tho&s;e things only for a &s;hort time from the continental troops, many of whom would other|wi&s;e be enabled to take the field.</P>
<P>The &s;ecretary of the board of war has tran&s;mitted me ex|tracts of general Schuyler's letters, in which he calls pre&s;&s;|ingly for &s;ome general officers to be &s;ent to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This will &s;hew you the nece&s;&s;ity of immediately making the promotions recommended in mine of the twenty-&s;econd of January; for at pre&s;ent I cannot &s;pare a general officer from this quarter without injuring the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Nothing of con&s;equence has happened &s;ince I wrote to you la&s;t, except a &s;kirmi&s;h on the fir&s;t of this month, five or &s;ix miles from Brun&s;wic-landing, between our advanced par|ties (about &s;even hundred in the whole) and upwards of two thou&s;and of the enemy, under Sir William Er&s;kine. The heat of the engagement was <HI>[borne by]</HI> colonel Scott of the fifth Virginia regiment, who, with about a hundred men, beat back two hundred of the Briti&s;h grenadiers. Sev|eral other officers behaved with great &s;pirit; but there is &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that colonel * * *, who command|ed our main body, did not behave altogether as he ought. I have ordered a court upon him, that the matter may be fairly canva&s;&s;ed, and that he may &s;tand condemned or ac|quitted by the evidence of tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Colonel * * *, who was under arre&s;t upon a charge of cowardice, broke his parole and went over to Bucks-county, I &s;uppo&s;e with an intent to make his e&s;cape: but I di&s;patched a troop of light hor&s;e after him, who brought him back ye&s;|terday; and he is to take his trial on Friday.</P>
<P>The &s;mall-pox has made &s;uch head in every quarter, that I find it impo&s;&s;ible to keep it from &s;preading through the whole army in the natural way. I have therefore deter|mined,
<PB N="25" REF="029737_0363_0FE24B3984E8B6C0">
not only to inoculate all the troops now here that have not had it, but &s;hall order doctor Shippen to inoculate the recruits as fa&s;t as they come in to Philadelphia. They will lo&s;e no time, becau&s;e they will go through the di&s;order while their clothing, arms and accoutrements are getting ready.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t in&s;titution of civil government, it has been the national policy of every precedent State to endeavour to engage its members to the di&s;charge of their public duty by the obligation of &s;ome oath: its force and happy influence has been felt in too many in&s;tances, to need any arguments to &s;upport the policy or prove its utility. I have often thought the States have been too negligent in this particular, and am more fully convinced of it from the effect general Howe's excur&s;ion has produced in New-Jer&s;ey. An oath is the only &s;ub&s;titute that can be adopted to &s;upply the defect of princi|ple. By our inattention in this article, we lo&s;e a con&s;ider|able cement to our own force, and give the enemy an oppor|tunity to make the fir&s;t tender of the oath of allegiance to the king. Its baneful influence is but too &s;everely felt at this time. The people generally confe&s;s they were compelled to take protection, and &s;ub&s;cribe the <HI>Declaration:</HI> yet it fur|ni&s;hes many with arguments to refu&s;e taking any active part&punc; and further they allege them&s;elves bound to a neutrality at lea&s;t. Many con&s;cientious people who were well-wi&s;hers to the cau&s;e, had they been bound to the States by an oath, would have &s;uffered any puni&s;hment rather than have taken the oath of allegiance to the king; and are now lo&s;t to our intere&s;t for want of this nece&s;&s;ary tie. Notwith&s;tanding the obligation of the <HI>A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> they do not conceive it to have the &s;ame effect as an oath. The more united the inhabit|ants appear, the greater difficulty general Howe will have in reconciling them to regal government, and con&s;equently the le&s;s hope of conquering them. For the&s;e rea&s;ons and many more that might be urged, I &s;hould &s;trongly recom|mend every State to fix upon &s;ome oath or affirmation of allegiance to be tendered to all the inhabitants without ex|ception, and to outlaw tho&s;e that refu&s;e it.</P>

<P>I WAS ye&s;terday waited upon by two French gen|tlemen, mon&s;ieur Romand de Li&s;le, and Robillard. The fir&s;t produced a commi&s;&s;ion &s;igned by you in November la&s;t, appointing him a major of artillery: but, by the inclo&s;ed let|ter from him to me, he claims much higher rank under the promi&s;e of Congre&s;s&mdash;that of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ommandant of the continen|tal artillery. Whether any &s;uch promi&s;e was made, I leave you to determine.</P>
<P>Robillard claims a captaincy of artillery: but, upon what he grounds his preten&s;ions, I do not know. I never &s;aw him but once before; and that was upon his way from Bo&s;|ton to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>You cannot conceive what a weight the&s;e kind of people are upon the &s;ervice, and upon me in particular. Few of them have any knowledge of the branches which they pro|fe&s;s to under&s;tand; and tho&s;e that have are entirely u&s;ele&s;s as officers, from their ignorance of the Engli&s;h language. I wi&s;h it were po&s;&s;ible to make them under&s;tand, when com|mi&s;&s;ions are granted to them, that they are to make them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of the Engli&s;h language in &s;ome degree before they can be attached to any particular corps.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you on the fifth in&s;tant, no event of an important and intere&s;ting nature has occurred, unle&s;s the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of our parties in foraging and bringing off &s;everal hor&s;es, waggons, and &s;ome fat cattle and &s;heep, which were contiguous to and around the enemy's lines, are con&s;idered as &s;uch. I then mentioned that I had &s;uch a &s;cheme in contemplation, which was happily accom|pli&s;hed the next day without any lo&s;s. The enemy in turn have made frequent efforts in that way, but with little &s;uc|ce&s;s. Whenever they made the attempt, it never failed to produce a &s;kirmi&s;h. They have been common of late, but with little damage to either &s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="029737_0365_0FE24B3B0824BB68">
We have certain intelligence that they have drawn the greate&s;t part of their troops from Rhode-I&s;land, and are told that part of them have landed on Staten-I&s;land and at Am|boy, with a view of augmenting their force at Brun&s;wic.</P>
<P>Colonel * * *, agreeable to the information contained in my la&s;t, has been tried by a court-martial, and ca&s;hiered. The proceedings and &s;entence I directed to be tran&s;mitted to the &s;ecretary of the war-office, and to the printers of this State and Virginia, to be publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>General Lincoln is ju&s;t arrived with a regiment of Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts militia, about two hundred and fifty. This, he &s;ays, is &s;ucceeded by three more, which will make in the whole near eighteen hundred: but in this I think he mu&s;t be mi&s;taken, unle&s;s tho&s;e on the march are much fuller and larger than what they u&s;ually are. The whole are of the troops that were with general Heath.</P>
<P>General Knox, by a letter of the fir&s;t in&s;tant, informs me, that, on mature inquiry and examination, he finds Spring|field to be more convenient and much better calculated for an elaboratory and cannon-foundery, than any other part of the New-England States. He adds that a quantity of copper, tin, and other u&s;eful materials, can be had there; and that the nece&s;&s;ary works and preparations, from the&s;e and other advantages, can be accompli&s;hed at lea&s;t three or four months &s;ooner there than any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of his opinion, which I e&s;teem of weight, particularly in this in&s;tance&mdash;and knowing the importance of, and how e&s;&s;ential the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments are&mdash;I have ven|tured to order the works to be begun there, without regard to what had been done at Brookfield, which was of but little con&s;equence. The former, be&s;ides the many advantages mentioned by general Knox, &s;tands on Connecticut-river, and has a good navigation: yet is entirely &s;ecure again&s;t any attempts of the enemy, being twenty miles above Hartford, where the river is narrow, and too &s;hoal to admit ve&s;&s;els that can give the lea&s;t annoyance. As nothing but the good of the &s;ervice could have led to this mea&s;ure, I tru&s;t it will be approved.</P>
<P>I have wrote to the a&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts State and the convention of New-Hamp&s;hire, reque&s;ting their good offices and exertions to promote the rai&s;ing of their regiments

<P>Mr. James Mea&s;e is now here in con&s;equence of being appointed clothier-general. He is adju&s;ting a plan for an|&s;wering the end of his appointment, and making an e&s;timate, to be laid before Congre&s;s or their &s;ecret committee, of &s;uch clothes as may be nece&s;&s;ary to import for the army.</P>
<P>It is with much concern that the &s;ituation of our affairs obliges me to mention &s;o frequently the want of money, e&s;|pecially when I am per&s;uaded every means are u&s;ed to fur|ni&s;h it. Our di&s;tre&s;s on this account is great indeed; and the injury the &s;ervice receives, almo&s;t inconceivable:&mdash;not a day, an hour, or &s;carcely a minute pa&s;&s;es, without com|plaints and applications on this head. The recruiting the regiments is mo&s;t materially retarded by it.</P>

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour to inclo&s;e you a plan drawn up by doctor Shippen in c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ert with doctor Cochran, for
<PB N="29" REF="029737_0367_0FE24B449E6AB288">
the arrangement and future regulation of the general ho&s;pi|tal. As this plan is very exten&s;ive, the appointments numer|ous, and the &s;alaries affixed to them at pre&s;ent, large, I did not think my&s;elf at liberty to adopt any part of it before I laid it before Congre&s;s for their approbation. I will ju&s;t re|mark, that, though the expen&s;e attending an ho&s;pital upon the inclo&s;ed plan will be very great, it will in the end not only be a &s;aving to the public, but the only po&s;&s;ible method of keeping an army a-foot.</P>
<P>We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> now at an enormous bounty, and with no &s;mall difficulty, recruiting an army of upwards of a hundred bat|talions. The en&s;uing campaign may, from the &s;ame cau&s;es, prove as &s;ickly as the la&s;t: and if the ho&s;pitals are in no better condition for the reception of the &s;ick, our regiments will be reduced to companies by the end of the campaign; and tho&s;e poor wretches who e&s;cape with life will be either &s;cattered up and down the country, and not to be found, or, if found, totally enervated and unfit for further duty. By the&s;e means not only the bounty is lo&s;t, but the man is lo&s;t al&s;o: and I leave you to judge whether we have men enough to allow of &s;uch a con&s;umption of lives and con&s;ti|tutions as have been lo&s;t the la&s;t campaign. For my own part I am certain, that, if the army which I hope we &s;hall have in the field this year is &s;uffered to moulder away by &s;ickne&s;s as it did the la&s;t, we mu&s;t look for reinforcements to &s;ome other places than our own States.</P>
<P>The number of officers mentioned in the inclo&s;ed plan I pre&s;ume are nece&s;&s;ary for us, becau&s;e they are found &s;o in the Briti&s;h ho&s;pitals: and, as they are e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the &s;ure&s;t ba&s;is,&mdash;that of long experience under the able&s;t phy|&s;icians and &s;urgeons,&mdash;we &s;hould not he&s;itate a moment in adopting their regulations, when they &s;o plainly tend to correct and improve our former want of method and knowl|edge in this important department.</P>
<P>The pay affixed to the different appointments is, as I &s;aid before, great, and perhaps more than you may think adequate to the &s;ervice. In determining upon the &s;um that is to be allowed to each, you ought to con&s;ider that it &s;hould be &s;uch as will induce gentlemen of character and &s;kill in their profe&s;&s;ion to &s;tep forth, and in &s;ome manner adequate to the practice which they have at home: for unle&s;s &s;uch
<PB N="30" REF="029737_0368_0FE24AF16E7B1FC8">
gentlemen are induced to undertake the care and manage|ment of our ho&s;pitals, we had better tru&s;t to the force of nature and con&s;titution, than &s;uffer per&s;ons entirely ignorant of medicine to de&s;troy us by ill-directed applications.</P>
<P>I hear from every quarter, that the dread of undergoing the &s;ame mi&s;eries for want of proper care and attention when &s;ick, has much retarded the new enli&s;tments, particularly to the &s;outhward. This is another rea&s;on for e&s;tabli&s;hing our ho&s;pitals upon a large and generous plan: for we ought to make the &s;ervice as agreeable and enticing as po&s;&s;ible to the &s;oldiery, many of whom (e&s;pecially when we call forth the militia) not only quit the comforts but the luxuries of life.</P>
<P>A few days ago doctor * * * &s;ent me the inclo&s;ed man|u&s;cript, which is a vindication of his conduct, upon which he de&s;ires a court of inquiry may be held. I tran&s;mit it to you by his direction. As I do not know what particular charges were alleged again&s;t him, I can &s;ay nothing to it or about it. You will find a plan of his al&s;o inclo&s;ed, for the better regulation of the ho&s;pital: but I think all his hints are included in doctor Shippen's plan.</P>
<P>As no time is to be lo&s;t in appointing the nece&s;&s;ary of|ficers, fixing upon the proper places for ho&s;pitals, and many other preparations, I could wi&s;h that Congre&s;s would take this matter under their immediate con&s;ideration, and favour me with their &s;entiments thereon as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE principal de&s;ign of this is to inform you, that we have &s;trong rea&s;ons to believe that the enemy are on the point of making &s;ome pu&s;h. What their object is,&mdash;whether to beat up our quarters and to extend their own, to make a large forage and collection of provender, of which they are in great want, or to turn their views towards the Delaware,&mdash;is a matter of uncertainty: but it &s;eems probable that one of the&s;e things they have in contemplation. Such of their troops as have returned from Rhode-I&s;land have landed at Amboy, and, with them, &s;everal pieces of heavy artillery. General Howe is come over too, and it is &s;aid, lord Percy.
<PB N="31" REF="029737_0369_0FE24B465D9FC938">
Their number at Brun&s;wic and the landing place, before the arrival of this la&s;t reinforcement, was e&s;timated from &s;even to eight thou&s;and.</P>
<P>I have ordered the utmo&s;t vigilance and attention to be ob|&s;erved at our &s;everal po&s;ts, to guard again&s;t &s;urpri&s;es, and every preparation to be made that the weak and feeble &s;tate of our little army will admit of. At this time we are only about four thou&s;and &s;trong; a force, you will &s;uppo&s;e, une|qual to a &s;ucce&s;sful oppo&s;ition, if they were not militia, and far too &s;mall for the exigencies of our affairs.

<P>MONSIEUR Faneuil, who &s;ome time ago laid a plan before you for rai&s;ing and officering a corps of Frenchmen, waited upon me ye&s;terday. His &s;ucce&s;s, as I expected, has been &s;mall in enli&s;ting or rather engaging Can|adians. I cannot find that he has met with more than thir|ty or forty who would be willing to &s;erve with him. He is now upon another &s;cheme,&mdash;that of rai&s;ing, arming and clothing a number of men in the French i&s;lands. To grant a commi&s;&s;ion of that kind is without the extent of my pow|ers, and I have therefore de&s;ired him to go forward, and lay
<PB N="32" REF="029737_0370_0FE24AF2F113CC08">
his propo&s;als before Congre&s;s. If they appear fea&s;ible, they may be adopted&punc; but I would beg leave to ob&s;erve that one precaution will be nece&s;&s;ary, that is, that the commi&s;|&s;ions of mon&s;ieur Faneuil and his officers &s;hould depend upon the performance of their agreement for rai&s;ing any certain number of men.</P>
<P>I have often mentioned to you the di&s;tre&s;s I am every now and then laid under by the application of French of|ficers for commi&s;&s;ions in our &s;ervice. This evil, if I may call it &s;o, is a growing one: for, from what I learn, they are coming in &s;warms from old France and the i&s;lands. There will therefore be a nece&s;&s;ity of providing for them or di&s;countenancing them. To do the fir&s;t is difficult; and the la&s;t, di&s;agreeable, and perhaps impolitic, if they are men of merit:&mdash;and it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e from mere adventurers, of whom, I am convinced, there are the greate&s;t number. They &s;eldom bring more than a com|mi&s;&s;ion and pa&s;&s;port, which, we know, may belong to a bad as well as a good officer.</P>
<P>Their ignorance of our language, and their inability to re|cruit men, are un&s;urmountable ob&s;tacles to their being in|grafted into our continental battalions: for our officers, who have rai&s;ed their men, and have &s;erved through the war up|on pay that has hitherto not borne their expen&s;es, would be di&s;gu&s;ted if foreigners were put over their heads:&mdash;and I a&s;&s;ure you, few or none of the&s;e gentlemen look lower than field-officers' commi&s;&s;ions. To give them all brevets, by which they have rank and draw pay without doing any &s;er|vice, is &s;addling the continent with a va&s;t expen&s;e: and to form them into corps, would be only e&s;tabli&s;hing corps of officers; for, as I &s;aid before, they cannot po&s;&s;ibly rai&s;e any men.</P>
<P>Some general mode of di&s;po&s;ing of them mu&s;t be adopted; for it is ungenerous to keep them in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and at great charge to them&s;elves: but I am at a lo&s;s how to point out this mode. Suppo&s;e they were told in general, that no man could obtain a commi&s;&s;ion, except he could rai&s;e a number of men in proportion to his rank. This would effectually &s;top the mouths of common appliers, and would leave us at liberty to make provi&s;ion for gentlemen of undoubted
<PB N="33" REF="029737_0371_0FE24B47E10C3C50">
military character and merit, who would be very u&s;eful to us as &s;oon as they acquired our language.</P>
<P>If you approve of this, or can think of any better meth|od, be plea&s;ed to inform me as &s;oon as you po&s;&s;ibly can&punc; for, if I had a deci&s;ive an&s;wer to give them, it would not only &s;ave me much trouble but much time, which I am now obliged to be&s;tow in hearing their different preten&s;ions to merit, and their expectations thereupon.</P>
<P>I inclo&s;e you the papers which Mon&s;ieur Faneuil origi|nally laid before the council of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts: they may be of u&s;e if you enter into a negociation with him.</P>

<P>CONGRESS having re&s;olved that &s;everal regiments of cavalry &s;hould be rai&s;ed to form a part of their army, I beg leave, through you, to lay before them the inclo&s;ed li&s;t of officers which appear nece&s;&s;ary to be appointed to each corps, and which they will be plea&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h. At the &s;ame time I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it highly expedient to fix their pay and that of the privates. There is now one regiment in &s;ervice, and three more recruiting: this makes it indi&s;|pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be done. Applications are con&s;tantly making to know what the pay is, and objections rai&s;ed again&s;t the &s;ervice for want of due information.</P>
<P>I have tran&s;mitted a li&s;t of &s;uch pay as &s;eemed to be thought rea&s;onable for part of the officers to receive when colonel Sheldon's regiment was directed to be levied, and a copy of the memorandum made at that time. This, col|onel Sheldon conceived, would not be more than adequate to their &s;ervices, trouble, and expen&s;e, and which in &s;ome degree was founded on the opinions of other gentlemen of whom inquiry was made upon the &s;ubject. I did not fix it in the in&s;tances where it is &s;et down with certainty, as the memorandum will &s;hew. A criterion, by which I was al&s;o governed upon that occa&s;ion, was the re&s;olve appoint|ing Mr. Sheldon lieutenant-colonel-commandant, with the rank and pay of colonel. From thence I attempted to pro|portion that of &s;ome other officers. Upon the whole, I
<PB N="34" REF="029737_0372_0FE24AFC6C680AC0">
think it &s;hould be &s;ettled without further lo&s;s of time, and wi&s;h the earlie&s;t attention of Congre&s;s to be had to it.</P>
<P>Our delicate and truly critical &s;ituation, for want of a &s;uf|ficient force to oppo&s;e the enemy who are now ready, and, before many days elap&s;e, will take the field, induced me to expect that the troops rai&s;ing in the &s;outhern States, and intended for this army, would march in companies or half companies as they were made up, without waiting for their regiments to be complete. Policy &s;trongly &s;ugge&s;ted the propriety of the mea&s;ure, and I reque&s;ted it: but, to my great anxiety and &s;urpri&s;e, I am told that this line of con|duct is totally neglected, though a great number of recruits are actually engaged. I mu&s;t entreat Congre&s;s to interpo&s;e again with their mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing applications and commands that this expedient be adopted without a moment's delay. No injury can re&s;ult from it, becau&s;e a &s;ufficient number of proper officers can and mu&s;t be left, to recruit the corps to their full complement.</P>
<P>Nor will my fears re&s;pecting the &s;tate of our arms allow me to be &s;ilent on that head. Let the States be urged to &s;end their men equipped with them and every other nece&s;|&s;ary, if po&s;&s;ible. I know not what &s;upplies may be in &s;tore el&s;ewhere, or in the power of Congre&s;s: but they mu&s;t not depend upon their being furni&s;hed here with any, or but with very few:&mdash;no human prudence or precaution could &s;ecure but a &s;mall part of tho&s;e belonging to the public, and in the hands of the &s;oldiery, from being embezzled and carried off when their time of &s;ervice expired; nor can the &s;ame abu&s;es be re&s;trained in the militia.</P>

They were however oppo&s;ed in &s;o &s;pirited a manner by our advanced parties, that they were checked, and retired in the afternoon towards Amboy, from whence they came. Their lo&s;s in the cour&s;e of the day, from the be&s;t accounts I can get, amounts to about one hundred in killed, wounded, pri&s;oners, and de&s;erters. Some people who were near the &s;cene of action, and who have picked up accounts from tho&s;e who have &s;ince been in Amboy, are &s;anguine enough to &s;uppo&s;e that they have lo&s;t five hundred all together: but of this I have no conception.

<P>I was in hopes, that, by the time the militia who are now in &s;ervice would be di&s;charged, we &s;hould have a con|&s;iderable number of the new levies in the field: but, though I have reports from all quarters of the great &s;ucce&s;s of re|cruiting, I cannot get a man of them into &s;ervice. General John&s;on's militia all go the fifth of March (many are gone already) and general Lincoln's on the fifteenth. The&s;e two bodies form &s;o con&s;iderable a part o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ur force, that, unle&s;s they are replaced, I &s;hall be left in a manner de&s;ti|tute: for I have no great hopes of &s;eeing an equal number of continental troops by that time.</P>
<P>I have wrote to Penn&s;ylvania, to endeavour to get a re|inforcement of militia from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ence; and I am told the mi|litia from the counties of Baltimore, Hartford, and Cecil, in Maryland, are on their march: but as I have it not from any authority, I know not when to expect them, or in what numbers. They are about pa&s;&s;ing a militia-law in this State, which may perhaps have &s;ome effect: but at pre&s;ent they are under no regulation at all.</P>
<P>I have in my late letters recommended &s;everal things to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our con&s;ideration, particularly that of a promotion of general officers.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this evening honoured with your favour of the twenty-third ultimo, accompanied by &s;undry proceed|ings of Congre&s;s. Tho&s;e re&s;pecting general Lee, and which pre&s;cribe the treatment of lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the five He&s;&s;ian field-officers, are the cau&s;e of this letter.</P>
<P>Though I &s;incerely commi&s;erate the misfortunes of gen|eral Lee, and feel much for his pre&s;ent unhappy &s;ituation, yet, with all po&s;&s;ible deference to the opinion of Congre&s;s, I fear that the&s;e re&s;olutions would not have the de&s;ired ef|fect&mdash;are founded in impolicy&mdash;and will, if adhered to, produce con&s;equences of an exten&s;ive and melancholy na|ture. Retaliation is certainly ju&s;t, and &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;a|ry, even where attended with the &s;evere&s;t penalties: but, when the evils which may and mu&s;t re&s;ult from it exceed tho&s;e intended to be redre&s;&s;ed, prudence and policy require that it &s;hould be avoided. Having premi&s;ed thus much, I beg leave to examine the ju&s;tice and expediency of it in the in&s;tances now before us.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="029737_0375_0FE24B515DE60D80">
From the be&s;t information I have been able to obtain, general Lee's u&s;age has not been &s;o di&s;graceful and di&s;hon|ourable as to authori&s;e the treatment decreed to tho&s;e gen|tlemen, was it not prohibited by many other important con|&s;iderations. His confinement, I believe, has been more rigorous than has been generally experienced by the re&s;t of our officers, or tho&s;e of the enemy who have been in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: but if the reports be true, (received on that head) he has been provided with a decent apartment and with mo&s;t things nece&s;&s;ary to render him comfortable. This is not the ca&s;e with one of the officers comprehended in the re&s;olves, if his letter, of which a copy is tran&s;mitted, de&s;erves your credit. Here retaliation &s;eems to have been prematurely begun; or, to &s;peak with more propriety, &s;everities have been and are exerci&s;ed towards colonel Campbell, not ju&s;tified by any that general Lee has yet received.</P>
<P>In point of policy, under the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of our af|fairs, this doctrine cannot be &s;upported. The balance of pri&s;oners is greatly again&s;t us; and a general regard to the happine&s;s of the whole &s;hould mark our conduct. Can we imagine that our enemies will not mete the &s;ame puni&s;h|ments, the &s;ame indignities, the &s;ame cruelties, to tho&s;e be|longing to us, in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that we impo&s;e on theirs in our power? Why &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e them to po&s;&s;e&s;s more humanity than we have our&s;elves? or why &s;hould an inef|fectual attempt to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of one brave unfor|tunate man involve many more in the &s;ame calamities?</P>
<P>However di&s;agreeable the fact may be, the enemy at this time have in their power, and &s;ubject to their call, near three hundred officers belonging to the army of the United States. In this number there are &s;ome of high rank; and mo&s;t of them are men of bravery and of merit. The quota of theirs in our hands bears no proportion, being not more than fifty at mo&s;t. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances we &s;hould certainly do no act to draw upon the gentlemen belonging to us, and who have already &s;uffered a long captivity, greater puni&s;hments than they have and now experience. If we &s;hould, what will their feelings be, and tho&s;e of their numerous and ex|ten&s;ive connexions?&mdash;Suppo&s;e the treatment pre&s;cribed for the He&s;&s;ians &s;hould be pur&s;ued, will it not e&s;tabli&s;h what the enemy have been aiming to effect by every artifice and
<PB N="38" REF="029737_0376_0FE24B00BB5DD488">
the gro&s;&s;e&s;t mi&s;repre&s;entations,&mdash;I mean, an opinion of our enmity towards them, and of the cruel conduct they expe|rience when they fall into our hands,&mdash;a prejudice which we on our part have heretofore thought it politic to &s;up|pre&s;s and to root out by every act of lenity and of kindne&s;s? It certainly will:&mdash;the He&s;&s;ians would hear of the puni&s;h|ment with all the circum&s;tances of heightened exaggera|tion&mdash;would feel the injury, without inve&s;tigating the cau&s;e, or rea&s;oning upon the ju&s;tice or nece&s;&s;ity of it. The mi&s;|chiefs, which may and mu&s;t inevitably flow from the execu|tion of the re&s;olves, appear to be endle&s;s and innumerable.</P>
<P>On my own part, I have been much embarra&s;&s;ed on the &s;ubject of exchanges already. Applications are daily made by both friends and enemies, to complete them as far as circum&s;tances of number and rank will apply. Some of the former have complained that a di&s;crimination is about to be adopted, perhaps injurious to their reputation, and certainly depriving them of their right of exchange in due cour&s;e, as e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the principles of equality pro|po&s;ed la&s;t year, acceded to by both parties, and now &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting. The latter charge me with a breach of faith, and call upon me to perform the agreement.</P>
<P>Many more objections might be &s;ubjoined, were they material:&mdash;I &s;hall only ob&s;erve that the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our army (if it de&s;erves that name) will not authori&s;e the lan|guage of retaliation or the &s;tyle of menace. This will be conceded by all who know that the whole of our force is weak and trifling, and compo&s;ed of militia (a very few reg|ular troops excepted) who&s;e &s;ervice is on the eve of ex|piring.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal other matters which might be men|tioned upon this &s;ubject, would time and opportunity per|mit: but as they will not, I beg leave to refer you to col|onel Walker, who will deliver this, and give &s;atisfaction to any inquiries that may be deemed nece&s;&s;ary. Per&s;uading my&s;elf that Congre&s;s will indulge the liberty I have taken upon this occa&s;ion, I have only to wi&s;h for the re&s;ult of their deliberations after they have recon&s;idered the re&s;olves, and to a&s;&s;ure them that I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour to tran&s;mit you the inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from general Lee, received by a flag on Tue&s;day la&s;t. You will perceive from thence his wi&s;hes and expectations of &s;eeing &s;ome members of Congre&s;s in con&s;e|quence of his letter upon that &s;ubject. None of the pa&s;&s;|ports which he mentions were &s;ent out, though the letter came by general Howe's permi&s;&s;ion as the others did. I &s;hould be happy to relieve his anxiety as far as I could, by &s;ending in major Morris: but this I cannot do till a &s;afe-conduct is granted.</P>
<P>The more I con&s;ider the re&s;olves re&s;pecting lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the He&s;&s;ian officers, the more con|vinced I am of their impolicy. The propo&s;ition made by Congre&s;s for the exchange of pri&s;oners, and which by their direction was tran&s;mitted to general Howe, was found|ed on principles of equality in number and in rank. From hence no demand, as a matter of right, can be made of general Lee's relea&s;ement for any officer or number of of|ficers of inferior rank: whatever is or might be done in &s;uch in&s;tance, would be of favour and indulgence. The only cartel that now &s;ub&s;i&s;ts is the one I have mentioned. This, &s;o far as it goes, is a beneficial one: it recogni&s;es the rank of our officers, and in&s;ures their di&s;charge from captivity whenever we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a like number belonging to them, and of the &s;ame rank. If on our part it &s;hould be violated,&mdash;if it is not ob&s;erved,&mdash;&s;urely it will and mu&s;t cea&s;e to be obligatory on general Howe. What con&s;e|quences may then en&s;ue, I leave to your conjecture.</P>
<P>If it be objected that the above ob&s;ervations, and what I &s;aid in my former letter, prove that no treatment receiv|ed by our officers &s;hould be retaliated on theirs,&mdash;my an|&s;wer is, that the proportion of officers in their hands is at lea&s;t &s;ix to one in ours. This con&s;ideration, &s;uppo&s;ing we had a right to demand general Lee's liberty, would be of great weight, and &s;ufficient to prevent, in my opinion, the execution of the re&s;olves. I have the honour to be, in ha&s;te, your mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honoured &s;everal days ago with your letter of the twenty-fifth ultimo, with its inclo&s;ures, the receipt of which was omitted to be acknowledged in my la&s;t.</P>
<P>Could I accompli&s;h the important objects &s;o eagerly wi&s;h|ed by Congre&s;s,&mdash;"confining the enemy within their pre&s;|ent quarters,&mdash;preventing their getting &s;upplies from the country, and totally &s;ubduing them before they are rein|forced,"&mdash;I &s;hould be happy indeed. But what pro&s;pect or hope can there be of my effecting &s;o de&s;irable a work at this time? The inclo&s;ed return, to which I &s;olicit the mo&s;t &s;erious attention of Congre&s;s, comprehends the whole force I have in Jer&s;ey. It is but a handful, and bears no pro|portion, on the &s;cale of numbers, to that of the enemy. Added to this, the major part is made up of militia. The mo&s;t &s;anguine in &s;peculation cannot deem it more than ade|quate to the lea&s;t valuable purpo&s;es of war.</P>
<P>The reinforcements mentioned to be drawn from general Heath were merely ideal,&mdash;nearly the whole of the ea&s;tern troops which were with him being here before. They were only engaged till to-day: and to-day they leave the camp. Their &s;ervice has been of pretty long continuance, and al|mo&s;t the whole of the winter months. What pro&s;pect there may be of immediate &s;uccours from other quarters, I know not: but from the militia of this State I cannot expect to derive much more aid. Tho&s;e who are well affected have been &s;o frequently called from their homes, that they are tired out, and almo&s;t profe&s;s an abhorrence of the &s;ervice: nor have I heard as yet that any continental troops are on the way. I have wrote to the brigadiers-general in mo&s;t of the States upon the &s;ubject, and al&s;o to the colonels, urging them by every motive to exert them&s;elves in filling the reg|iments, and to forward them on.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, Sir, I feel the mo&s;t painful anxiety when I reflect on our &s;ituation and that of the enemy. Unle&s;s the levies arrive &s;oon, we mu&s;t, before it be long, experience &s;ome intere&s;ting and melancholy event. I believe the en|emy have fixed their object, and the execution will &s;urely be attempted as &s;oon as the roads are pa&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ble. The un|prepared &s;tate in which we are, favours all their de&s;igns;
<PB N="41" REF="029737_0379_0FE24B556ED2D8D0">
and it is much to be wi&s;hed that they may not &s;ucceed to their warme&s;t expectations.</P>
<P>On recurring to the late promotions of brigadiers, I find the number appointed to be &s;hort of what I took the liberty to recommend, and not competent to the exigencies of the &s;ervice, &s;uppo&s;ing the whole in office before, and tho&s;e lately created, con&s;ent to act, which I have rea&s;on to believe will not be the ca&s;e. I &s;hall only beg leave to refer you to my former letters upon this &s;ubject, and to a&s;&s;ure you that many di&s;advantages will re&s;ult from not having a &s;ufficient number of officers of this rank. We have always been de|ficient in this in&s;tance; and certain I am that the &s;ervice has been greatly injured by it. The proportion I mentioned was full &s;mall, and, in my opinion, &s;hould not be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o take the liberty of mentioning again (having received no an&s;wer upon the &s;ubject) that &s;ettling the ho&s;|pital plan and e&s;tabli&s;hment becomes more and more nec|e&s;&s;ary. It is an object of infinite importance; and the dif|ficulties of doing it on a proper foundation will be great, if not almo&s;t in&s;urmountable, &s;hould it be deferred till the campaign opens, and the enemy begin their operations. The benefits of the in&s;titution will &s;oon be known:&mdash;the want was &s;everely felt in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year.</P>
<P>There is one thing more which claims, in my opinion, the earlie&s;t attention of Congre&s;s,&mdash;I mean the pay of the regimental &s;urgeons, and that of the mates. The&s;e ap|pointments are &s;o e&s;&s;ential, that they cannot be done with|out. The pay, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, is &s;o low, &s;o inadequate to the &s;ervices which &s;hould be performed, that no man &s;u&s;taining the character of a gentleman, and who has the lea&s;t medical abilities or &s;kill in the profe&s;&s;ion, can think of accepting it: that in the latter is &s;o paltry and trifling, that none, of the lea&s;t genero&s;ity of &s;entiment or preten&s;ions to merit, can con&s;ent to act for it. In a word, the&s;e are in|conveniences of an intere&s;ting nature:&mdash;they amount to an exclu&s;ion of per&s;ons who could di&s;charge the duties of tho&s;e offices; and, if not redre&s;&s;ed, there is not the &s;malle&s;t prob|ability that any can be prevailed on to enter them again.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal matters al&s;o which I referred to Con|gre&s;s &s;ome time &s;ince, and upon which I have not received
<PB N="42" REF="029737_0380_0FE24B0C3951DFB8">
the re&s;ult of their deliberations.&mdash;One inquiry, about the &s;tate of arms and ammunition, I am peculiarly anxious to be &s;atisfied in.</P>
<P>From the inconveniences and injuries to the &s;ervice of late for want of money, I am induced to reque&s;t that the &s;tricte&s;t regard &s;hould be had to furni&s;hing the pay-ma&s;ter with con&s;tant and &s;ufficient &s;upplies. On Sunday he re|ceived five hundred thou&s;and dollars, half of which is al|ready expended, and the balance in a day or two will be entirely &s;wept away&punc; without di&s;charging the &s;everal claims. By his report, the commi&s;&s;ary here requires an immediate draught for a hundred thou&s;and; and the militia returning and about to leave camp, a hundred and twenty thou&s;and more. The expen&s;e incurred by calling on them &s;o fre|quently is almo&s;t incredible. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are &s;ev|eral arrears due to the old troops, and to mo&s;t of the gen|eral and &s;taff officers.</P>

However, from the mo&s;t accurate e&s;timate that I can form, the whole of our numbers in Jer&s;ey, fit for duty at this time, is under three thou&s;and.

All that was po&s;&s;ible for me to do towards collecting a force at Peek&s;kill, I had attempted before: I had in peremptory terms called upon the officers of Rhode-I&s;land and Con|necticut to forward on their recruits under proper officers as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to that place: I had directed &s;uch of the New-York regiments as had been ordered to Ticonderoga, to repair thither: I had reque&s;ted eight of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts regiments to be marched to that po&s;t: and left the&s;e &s;hould not arrive in time, I urged governor Trumbull, in a letter of the &s;ixth in&s;tant, to &s;end two thou&s;and of his militia to the &s;ame place. But &s;orry I am to ob&s;erve, the militia have got tired; and the colonels of the continental regiments have been greatly deceived them&s;elves,&mdash;have greatly de|ceived me,&mdash;or the mo&s;t unheard-of de&s;ertions * * * have prevailed * * *: for regiments, reported two or

In Connecticut alone, by a letter from general Par&s;ons, of the &s;ixth in&s;tant, four regiments are mentioned as not hav|ing more than eighty rank and file, each.</P>
<P>The&s;e, Sir, are melancholy truths: but facts they are, and nece&s;&s;ary to be known to Congre&s;s, however prudent it may be to conceal them from the ob&s;ervation of others.</P>
<P>To &s;uperintend the bu&s;ine&s;s of recruiting,&mdash;to &s;ee that the officers were diligent,&mdash;to prevent impo&s;itions if po&s;|&s;ible,&mdash;to appoint fit places of rendezvous,&mdash;to &s;ee that the recruits were actually brought to tho&s;e places, and there equipped and trained for the field,&mdash;were among the great objects which early and repeatedly induced me to pre&s;s the appointment of general officers: but unfortunately the delay of appointing, being followed by the re&s;ignation of &s;ome officers and non-acceptance of others, will involve the army in a mere chaos of confu&s;ion at a time when the utmo&s;t order and regularity &s;hould prevail, and when all our arrangements ought to be completely e&s;tabli&s;hed. The medical department will, it is much to be feared, be in the &s;ame &s;ituation:&mdash;not an officer yet appointed to it.</P>
<P>For want of proper and coercive powers,&mdash;from di&s;af|fection and other cau&s;es,&mdash;the militia of this State are not to be depended upon. They are drawn out with difficul|ty, and at a mo&s;t enormous expen&s;e, as their accounts will &s;hew: they come, you can &s;carce tell how; they go, you hardly know when. In the &s;ame predicament are tho&s;e of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>Numbers from this State have joined the enemy; and many more are di&s;po&s;ed to do &s;o, as the letter from Mr. Hoff (a copy of which is inclo&s;ed, corre&s;ponding with &s;ev|eral others of the &s;ame tenor) &s;ufficiently evinces.</P>

<P>I LAST night had the honour to receive your letter of the twenty-&s;ixth in&s;tant, accompanied by &s;undry re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, and &s;ome other papers.</P>
<P>The arrival of the arms, locks and flints, you have been plea&s;ed to mention, is a mo&s;t fortunate and happy event. I join you mo&s;t &s;incerely in congratulations upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have not yet obtained a certain account of the ex|pedition again&s;t and de&s;truction of Peek&s;kill. Information of tho&s;e events has not been yet tran&s;mitted by generals M^cDougal or Clinton, or the convention of the State. There is no doubt but that the town is de&s;troyed, and, with it, &s;ome &s;tores:&mdash;neither the quality nor amount of them is known. It is &s;aid that it was done in part by our own people when they found that they could not pre|vent them falling into the enemy's hands. The &s;hips and troops have gone down the river again.</P>
<P>Mr. Kirkland, the Oneida mi&s;&s;ionary, arrived here this week, with a chief warrior and five other Indians of that nation. They had been to Bo&s;ton, and came from thence to this place to inquire into the true &s;tate of matters, that they might report them to a grand council to be &s;hortly held. They &s;aid things were &s;o fal&s;ely and variou&s;ly rep|re&s;ented by our enemies through their agents, that they did not know what to depend on. I invited them to go to Philadelphia: but they declined it, declaring they were well &s;atisfied with what they had &s;een, and that they were authori&s;ed to tell their nation, all they had heard from the enemy was fal&s;e. Being told that France was a&s;&s;i&s;ting us, and about to join in the war, they &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed; and Mr. Kirkland &s;aid he was per&s;uaded it
<PB N="47" REF="029737_0385_0FE24B625CAB4778">
would have a con&s;iderable effect on the minds of &s;everal of the nations, and &s;ecure to us their neutrality, if not a declaration and commencement of ho&s;tilities in our favour. I &s;hewed them every civility in my power, and every thing that I thought material to excite in them an idea of our &s;trength and independence. After &s;taying two days, they &s;et off for their nation, expre&s;&s;ing their de&s;ire of the mo&s;t &s;peedy return to the council, and profe&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t friend|ly &s;entiments towards us.</P>

<P>CAPTAIN De&s;hields, of Mr. Buchanan's &s;hip from Baltimore, who was taken by the enemy and carried into York, made his e&s;cape from thence on Saturday evening. He informs that three thou&s;and troops, Briti&s;h and He&s;&s;ian, embarked about ten days ago from the city and Staten-I&s;land, on board tran&s;ports which were lying at the latter when he came away. He adds that the enemy have built

and are building a number of light flat-bottomed boats, about &s;eventy of which were fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Captain De&s;hields &s;ays it &s;eemed to be the general opin|ion and conver&s;ation that this embarkation was for Che&s;a|peak-bay, with a view of making a de&s;cent on the Ea&s;tern-Shore, or that the troops were to proceed to the Head of Elk, taking Annapolis and Baltimore in their way. There were &s;ome who thought it probable they mean to go up the North-river and attempt the Highland fortifications. I have written to general M^cDougal and Clinton, de&s;iring them to make the be&s;t preparation that circum&s;tances will admit of, for their reception, in ca&s;e the latter &s;hould be their object.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honour of writing to you la&s;t, I have received the inclo&s;ed from general M^cDougal, which contains a full account of the late affair at Peek&s;kill. Eve|ry prudential &s;tep appears to have been taken by the gener|al, and as good a di&s;po&s;ition made as his &s;mall number of men would admit of.</P>
<P>I have heard nothing further re&s;pecting the embarkation of troops which I mentioned in my la&s;t.

I have wrote to ha&s;ten them as much as po&s;&s;ible, le&s;t &s;uch another de|&s;ign &s;hould be really in agitation.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with yours of the fourth, inclo&s;ing &s;undry re&s;olves of Congre&s;s from the twenty-ninth of March to the fifth in&s;tant. I am extremely glad to &s;ee the re&s;olve for the immediate removal of military &s;tores from Baltimore and Annapolis: for, although I do not imagine that the enemy intend an expedition of any great con&s;e|quence in Che&s;apeak-bay, yet while the &s;tores lay at the above-mentioned places, they were always &s;ubject to be de&s;troyed by a &s;udden attack of a &s;hip of war with a few land forces.</P>
<P>The regulations for the pay-ma&s;ter-general's department are very &s;alutary, and, if carried &s;trictly into execution, will make a va&s;t &s;aving to the public. It may be ea&s;ily done when the army is put upon a regular footing: but while we are obliged to make u&s;e of militia, we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to all the irregularities that naturally attend them, and mu&s;t not therefore expect to have the rule as &s;crupulou&s;ly complied with by them as could be wi&s;hed. * * *</P>
<P>The mu&s;ter-ma&s;ter-general complained that the duty re|quired of him was more than he could perform: but by the late re&s;olves there is an ample allowance for deputies; and therefore no further excu&s;e can be made upon that head.</P>
<P>I mo&s;t ardently wi&s;h to &s;ee the ho&s;pital e&s;tabli&s;hed. I am afraid too much time has been lo&s;t in the con&s;ideration
<PB N="50" REF="029737_0388_0FE24B1C450D0B88">
of the plan: but the gentlemen who &s;hall be appointed to the &s;uperintendence mu&s;t endeavour to make up for lo&s;t time by their diligence.</P>
<P>By the late&s;t accounts from Brun&s;wic, it looks as if the enemy were projecting an embarkation. They have been &s;tripping the buildings of boards, and cutting &s;mall timber, and tran&s;porting them from Brun&s;wic to Amboy. It is imagined this is to build births in their tran&s;ports. I &s;hall keep a con&s;tant look-out upon the motions of their ve&s;&s;els, and &s;hall endeavour to obtain every intelligence by &s;ending people into their quarters. I think Delaware-bay mu&s;t be their de&s;tination, if they move by water.</P>

<P>I WAS ju&s;t now honoured with your letter of the ninth in&s;tant, covering &s;undry re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s. Tho&s;e for regulating the ho&s;pital and medical department, I tru&s;t, will prove of the mo&s;t &s;alutary con&s;equences. It is only to be regretted that this nece&s;&s;ary and liberal in&s;ti|tution had not been gone into and completed at an earlier period.</P>
<P>The honours Congre&s;s have decreed to the memory of generals Warren and Mercer afford me the highe&s;t plea&s;|ure: their character and merit had a ju&s;t claim to every mark of re&s;pect; and I heartily wi&s;h that every officer of the United States, emulating their virtues, may by their actions &s;ecure to them&s;elves the &s;ame right to the grateful tributes of their country.</P>
<P>Since writing to you ye&s;terday I have received further intelligence of the enemy's preparations in York, indicating a movement before long. It is contained in the inclo&s;ed letter, N^o 1, and corroborates the opinion I have long en|tertained that they would make a pu&s;h again&s;t Philadelphia. The tory regiments mentioned, we are told, are at Hack|in&s;ac, and are about five hundred &s;trong, exclu&s;ive of a company of Highlanders which is with them.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed letter from le chevalier count De Vrecourt came to hand this morning,&mdash;which I have thought proper
<PB N="51" REF="029737_0389_0FE299D28050EEC0">
to tran&s;mit to Congre&s;s, that they may con&s;ider his ca&s;e, and adopt &s;uch mea&s;ures re&s;pecting him as his character and te&s;timonials de&s;erve. I never heard of him before: but if he is a &s;kilful engineer, he will be extremely u&s;eful, and &s;hould be employed, though he may not under&s;tand our language. At this time we have not one with the army, nor one to join it, of the lea&s;t reputation or preten|&s;ions to &s;kill. If this gentleman came in con&s;equence of an agreement with doctor Franklin, and brought creden|tials from him, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e him to be acquainted with what he was recommended for.</P>
<P>The cartel, propo&s;ed to be &s;ettled, and &s;o long in agita|tion, is not accompli&s;hed yet: the la&s;t meeting on that bu&s;ine&s;s was the &s;econd in&s;tant, when nothing was done: nor is a further interview appointed re&s;pecting it. I have tran&s;mitted a copy of lord Cornwallis's letter which came out the next day, with that of the paper alluded to by him, which Mr. Harri&s;on refu&s;ed to receive from colonel Walcot, and of my an&s;wer to the latter in a letter to general Howe. The objections or articles mentioned by colonel Walcot were tho&s;e general Greene had with him, and which he left when he came from Philadelphia: the original I have by me. Tho&s;e points were in&s;i&s;ted on again, and rejected, and a tender made of the paper by colonel Walcot, which he brought with him prepared.</P>
<P>I have appointed John Wilkens, John Steel, Mathew Irvine, and Samuel Ker&s;ley, e&s;quires, captains of companies to be rai&s;ed by them, in con&s;equence of the recommenda|tion of general Arm&s;trong. As the intere&s;t of tho&s;e gen|tlemen lies in Penn&s;ylvania chiefly, and it would be draw|ing money from the pay-ma&s;ter here to carry to Philadel|phia, (&s;uppo&s;ing there was a &s;upply in the che&s;t, which is not the ca&s;e) I &s;hall be obliged by Congre&s;s's ordering &s;ix hundred dollars to be advanced to each of them on ac|count of the recruiting &s;ervice; the fir&s;t of whom I imag|ine is in Philadelphia. If this requi&s;ition can be complied with, he, I pre&s;ume, will give notice to the re&s;t; or, if general Arm&s;trong is informed of it, he will do it.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honoured with yours of the tenth, accompanied with one from the committee of Congre&s;s to whom I have wrote very fully upon the &s;ubject of the re&s;olve for forming an army upon the we&s;t &s;ide of Delawar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; and to which I refer you. I wi&s;h I could &s;ee any pro&s;pect of an army, fit to make proper oppo&s;ition, formed any where. You will perhaps be &s;urpri&s;ed at this, after the public reports of the great &s;ucce&s;s of recruiting in all the States; but, to convince you that the&s;e are but bare reports, I will give you the be&s;t information I have been able to collect from actual returns and other accounts.</P>
<P>New-Hamp&s;hire.&mdash;No returns: but a letter from gen|eral Heath &s;ays they are tolerably forward. All their regiments go to the northward.</P>
<P>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.&mdash;About four hundred men rai&s;ed to a regiment; many of the&s;e yet to undergo inoculation. Seven of their regiments go to the northward, and eight are to come to Peek&s;kill for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Rhode-I&s;land.&mdash;Only three hundred and &s;ixty men en|li&s;ted in both regiments the fir&s;t of April. Two hundred of the&s;e are yet to be inoculated. General Varnum writes me that he de&s;pairs of filling up the regiments.</P>
<P>Connecticut.&mdash;By a return from general Par&s;ons, of the fourth of April, about eighteen hundred men were recruited through the whole State,&mdash;they, much di&s;per&s;ed;&mdash;many to have the &s;mall-pox; and recruiting at a &s;tand.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="029737_0391_0FE299D55AC706B8">
New-York.&mdash;About two hundred men to a regiment: and, from the peculiar &s;ituation of that province, it will be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for them to fill up their regiments though they exert them&s;elves very much.</P>
<P>New-Jer&s;ey.&mdash;Between two and three hundred to a regiment. They al&s;o lie under many difficulties on ac|count of the di&s;affection of their State: but their officers are active and diligent.</P>
<P>Penn&s;ylvania.&mdash;Mo&s;t of her regiments are very back|ward; tho&s;e mo&s;t &s;o who have been longe&s;t recruiting.</P>
<P>Delaware State.&mdash;No return of their regiment.</P>
<P>Maryland.&mdash;I have only the return of one regiment, which con&s;i&s;ts of two hundred men; but I do not believe the others are in more forwardne&s;s. The di&s;putes about the rank of officers have prevailed &s;o much, that the re|cruiting &s;ervice has been in a manner neglected.</P>
<P>Virginia.&mdash;The nine old regiments will not exceed eigh|teen hundred effective men: and governor Henry, in a letter which I received ye&s;terday, informs me that he did not think that more than four of the &s;ix new ones would be filled. He propo&s;es the expediency of rai&s;ing volunteer companies to &s;erve &s;even or eight months, to make up the deficiency: but this I &s;hall object to on many accounts, particularly that it would be introducing a body of men who would look upon them&s;elves at liberty to do what they plea&s;ed, and, the moment their time expired, would leave us, though at the mo&s;t critical juncture.</P>
<P>If the men that are rai&s;ed, few as they are, could be got into the field, it would be a matter of &s;ome con&s;olation; but every method that I have been able to devi&s;e has prov|ed ineffectual. If I &s;end an officer to collect the &s;ick and &s;cattered of his regiment, it is ten to one but he neglects his duty, goes home on plea&s;ure or bu&s;ine&s;s, and the next that I hear of him is that he has re&s;igned:&mdash;furloughs are no more attended to than if there was no limitation of time: and in &s;hort, Sir, there is &s;uch a total depre&s;&s;ion of that mil|itary ardour which I hoped would have in&s;pired every of|ficer when he found his pay genteelly augmented, and the army put upon a re&s;pectable footing, that it &s;eems to me as if all public &s;pirit was &s;unk. * * *</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="029737_0392_0FE24B7004062AA8">
I &s;hall as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible tran&s;mit to the board of war a li&s;t of the appointments I have made in con&s;equence of the powers ve&s;ted in me.</P>
<P>If the appointments in the ho&s;pital are not filled up be|fore the receipt of this, I would take the liberty of men|tioning a gentleman whom I think highly de&s;erving of no|tice, not only on account of his abilities, but for the very great a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he has afforded in the cour&s;e of this winter, merely in the nature of a volunteer. The gentle|man is doctor John Cochran, well known to all the faculty, and particularly to doctor Shippen, who, I &s;uppo&s;e, has mentioned him among the candidates. The place for which the doctor is well fitted, and which would be mo&s;t agreeable to him, is &s;urgeon-general to the middle depart|ment. In this line he &s;erved all the la&s;t war in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice, and has di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf this winter, particular|ly in his attention to the &s;mall-pox patients and the wound|ed, who, but for him and doctor Bond, mu&s;t have &s;uffered much, if not been totally neglected, as there were no other medical gentlemen to be found. If the appointment of &s;urgeon-general is filled up, that of deputy-director of the middle department would be acceptable.</P>
<P>I have been thus full in my recommendation becau&s;e doctor Cochran in a manner had my promi&s;e of one of the capital appointments in the ho&s;pital, upon a pre&s;umption that I &s;hould have had &s;ome hand in the nomination by the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s empowering me to fill all commi&s;&s;ions under the rank of brigadiers-general.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 13.&mdash;I have this moment received a line from general Lincoln, informing me that the enemy attempted to &s;urpri&s;e him early this morning at his po&s;t at Bound-brook; but he made good his retreat to the pa&s;s of the mountains ju&s;t in his rear, with trifling lo&s;s.</P>

<P>THE inclo&s;ed from mon&s;ieur le chevalier De Dreud|homme de Borre, with the papers annexed to it, were re|ceived this day by the ea&s;tern mail. It appears that by an

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE nothing of importance to tran&s;mit Con|gre&s;s, no event in the military line having happened &s;ince my la&s;t, except the &s;urpri&s;ing a &s;mall picquet guard of the enemy on Monday night at Bonemtown, and bringing off thirteen pri&s;oners, by one of our parties. An enterpri&s;e of a &s;imilar nature was formed again&s;t that at Amboy, in which the party &s;ent to effect it did not &s;ucceed &s;o well, though the mo&s;t advanced of them &s;eized and &s;ecured three of their out-centries without giving an alarm.</P>
<P>By a letter from general M^cDougal, of ye&s;terday, I am informed that he had received accounts of thirty-&s;ix &s;ail of tran&s;ports having left Newport on Friday la&s;t, with troops on board. Other reports he had were that a number of &s;hips were coming up the Sound, &s;o that we may rea&s;onably conclude general Howe is drawing his forces from the ea&s;t|ward. General Arnold, in a letter of the &s;ixth, mention|ed, that, from the preparation of tran&s;ports, and other circum&s;tances, he thought it probable an embarkation was about to take place.</P>
<P>There are grounds to &s;u&s;pect, from information received, that &s;ome unfair practices have been and are meant to be u&s;ed in certain exports from Philadelphia. It is &s;aid that a ve&s;&s;el <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">avigated by Frenchmen loaded there, belonging to * * * of New-York, which carried her cargo to gener|al Howe; al&s;o that * * * and * * * of Monmouth-coun|ty intend to load one or more for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, under the idea of &s;ending them to foreign markets. I have writ|ten to the board of war for Penn&s;ylvania upon the &s;ubject,
<PB N="56" REF="029737_0394_0FE24B718A5F3660">
and doubt not but the&s;e hints will be properly improved, and &s;uch frauds guarded again&s;t as well as circum&s;tances will admit.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a copy of an adverti&s;ement publi&s;hed in Gaine's paper of the fourteenth, which &s;hews that no arti|fices are left untried by the enemy to injure us. Before the appearance of this unparalleled piece, I had heard that a per&s;on was gone from York to Rhode-I&s;land with a quantity of counterfeit money.</P>
<P>There is one thing which I beg leave to mention to Congre&s;s, and which I think highly de&s;erving their atten|tion, that is, that &s;upplies of hard money, or bills of ex|change to procure it, &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be &s;ent to our pri&s;|oners in the hands of the enemy, at lea&s;t to the officers, to relieve their wants. By letters which I have received from them of late, I find they are in great di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;uch as ought to be removed, if it can be done. No inconveni|ence will re&s;ult to the public from &s;uch &s;upplies, if they can be furni&s;hed, as proper &s;toppages and deductions can be made from their pay.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 19.&mdash;I was honoured with your letter of the &s;ixteenth between twelve and one o'clock ye&s;terday, ac|companied by &s;undry re&s;olutions. I hope the mea&s;ures Congre&s;s have adopted will produce the &s;alutary con&s;e|quences they had in view: but I fear that the States, unle&s;s they are delicate in exerci&s;ing the powers they are inve&s;ted with for filling vacancies in in&s;tances of removal from office, and pay &s;trict attention to a proper line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion where there are no capital objections, will renew much of that confu&s;ion and di&s;order we have been endeav|ouring to extricate our&s;elves from. Nor will this be of &s;mall difficulty, if they di&s;place many officers: for, &s;uppo&s;|ing them to have kept the mo&s;t accurate li&s;ts of their orig|inal appointments, changes have taken place in &s;everal in&s;tances from various cau&s;es unknown to them, and of which they cannot be appri&s;ed.</P>
<P>I can a&s;&s;ure Congre&s;s the appellation given to the reg|iments officered by me was without my con&s;ent or privity. As &s;oon as I heard it, I wrote to &s;everal of the officers in terms of &s;evere reprehen&s;ion, and expre&s;sly charged them to &s;uppre&s;s the di&s;tinction, adding that all the battalions
<PB N="57" REF="029737_0395_0FE299D8649CC5B0">
were on the &s;ame footing, and all under the general name of Continental.</P>
<P>An attack upon the king's troops at Rhode-I&s;land was certainly a de&s;irable event, could it have been conducted with &s;ucce&s;s, or upon equal terms. It being an object of great moment, and involving in its i&s;&s;ue many important con&s;equences, I am led to believe the practicability of it has had much con&s;ideration, and the mea&s;ure was found to be unadvi&s;eable under the circum&s;tances of the troops collected for the purpo&s;e. If the enemy have not evac|uated the i&s;land, I &s;uppo&s;e the matter will be further weighed.</P>
<P>I do not find in the medical arrangement any mention of regimental &s;urgeons'-mates, or provi&s;ion made for their payment. Whether Congre&s;s mean to di&s;pen&s;e with &s;uch officers or not, I cannot tell: I have heard that they do: but they appear to me to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. We are often obliged to divide regiments and &s;end a part to a di&s;tant po&s;t: when this is the ca&s;e, it is e&s;&s;ential that there &s;hould be &s;ome per&s;on with them to take charge of the &s;ick or wounded, if &s;uch there &s;hould be. I have only mentioned this of many rea&s;ons that might be urged to &s;hew the expediency of &s;uch appointments.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the many circum&s;tances inducing a belief that Philadelphia will be the fir&s;t object of the ene|my's attention,&mdash;yet, as the &s;tratagems of war are various, and they may be ea&s;ily changed, e&s;pecially when they have the entire command of the water,&mdash;I cannot but con&s;ider the detention of the troops at Philadelphia, farther than mentioned in my letter in an&s;wer to that from the board of war, as inexpedient, and &s;ubject to great inconvenience and injury. In the pre&s;ent divided, &s;eparated &s;tate of the army, we are weak at all points, and not able to make the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition promi&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s. Suppo&s;ing they were collected here, they would be ready to act as nece&s;&s;ity and circum|&s;tances might require. If the enemy pu&s;hed for Philadel|phia, we &s;hould have notice of it, and could hang upon their flank and rear: nor is it likely they would undertake &s;uch an expedition without attempting the de&s;truction or di&s;per&s;ion of the army fir&s;t. If they embarked and &s;hould go by &s;ea, we &s;hould have information of it, and could be
<PB N="58" REF="029737_0396_0FE24B730FF88810">
there in time. On the other hand, &s;hould all they have done prove a feint&punc; and they &s;hould turn their views to the North-river, we &s;hould be in a much better &s;ituation to counteract their de&s;igns, and to check the progre&s;s of their arms in that quarter. Added to this, &s;everal of the reg|iments, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which came fir&s;t from Virginia and Penn&s;ylvania, are &s;o broken that it is impo&s;&s;ible to do any thing with the parts that are here; and that &s;pirit which is always derived from a corps being full, or as much &s;o as circum&s;tances of number will admit of, is entirely done away.</P>

<P>I WAS this morning honoured with you favour of the twentieth, inclo&s;ing &s;undry proceedings of Congre&s;s. The removal of provi&s;ions, &amp;c. from the communication be|tween Brun&s;wic and Trenton has been pretty well effected already. It was an object early attended to, and what I recommended to the a&s;&s;embly of this State as de&s;er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing their interpo&s;ition and aid: but, finding that it had not their immediate con&s;ideration, and that they &s;eemed to decline interfering in the matter, I directed the quarter ma&s;ters and commi&s;&s;aries to purcha&s;e their fir&s;t &s;upplies of tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries from &s;uch places as appeared to be mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the enemy's incur&s;ions, and through which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is mo&s;t probable they will take their route towards the Delaware, in ca&s;e an enterpri&s;e that way &s;hould be in con|templation. I have tran&s;mitted copies of the re&s;olve up|on this &s;ubject to general Putnam and colonel Forman, (the latter of whom is in Monmouth-country) with orders to execute the &s;ame agreeable to the directions therein pre|&s;cribed, where it may be nece&s;&s;ary on the road leading from South-Amboy acro&s;s the country.</P>

<P>I WAS la&s;t night honoured with your letter of the twenty-fifth, with &s;undry re&s;olves of Congre&s;s. Such of them as are nece&s;&s;ary for my government and conduct I &s;hall &s;trictly attend to.</P>
<P>The money and bills for our pri&s;oners had better be tran&s;mitted to Elias Boudinot, e&s;quire, to whom I &s;hall give directions to adopt ways and means for &s;ending the &s;ame, and for a proper appropriation and di&s;tribution of the money among&s;t them. Bills, I think, will be mo&s;t eligible, provided they are duly paid. As to procuring clothes in New-York, I have rea&s;on to believe that it will not be al|lowed, and that the pri&s;oners, will obtain no &s;upplies but what we &s;end them.</P>
<P>I heard of Mr. Franklin's practices &s;ome time ago, and advi&s;ed governor Trumbull of the &s;ame, that his conduct might be properly attended to. It is very unhappy for us that, through the intrigues of &s;uch men, the enemy have found means to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ai&s;e a &s;pirit of di&s;affection but too gen|erally in many of the States. In this, I have &s;trong a&s;&s;ur|ances
<PB N="60" REF="029737_0398_0FE24B7B704F37D0">
that it has ari&s;en to a great height; and I &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be di&s;appointed if a large number of the inhabitants in &s;ome of the counties &s;hould openly appear in arms as &s;oon as the enemy begin their operations. I have taken every mea&s;ure in my power to &s;uppre&s;s it; but neverthele&s;s &s;everal from Su&s;&s;ex and Bergen have joined their army, and the &s;pirit becomes more and more daring every day.</P>
<P>You will be plea&s;ed to direct general Mifflin to remain in Philadelphia as long as Congre&s;s &s;hall think his pre&s;ence there e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a copy of general Howe's letter which I received la&s;t night in an&s;wer to mine of the ninth in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Nothing of an intere&s;ting nature has occurred &s;ince my la&s;t; which leaves me only to add, that I have the honour to be, with &s;entiments of the greate&s;t re&s;pect, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I LAST night received the favour of your letter of the twenty-&s;ixth, with the re&s;olves to which it alludes.</P>
<P>The views of Congre&s;s, in &s;ending general officers to the ea&s;tward to ha&s;ten on the troops, have been long an|ticipated: general Poor is in New-Hamp&s;hire for the pur|po&s;e,&mdash;general Heath in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, with the brig|adiers Nixon, Glover and Patter&s;on,&mdash;general Varnum in Rhode-I&s;land, and general Par&s;ons in Connecticut. Gen|erals Spencer and Arnold too have been de&s;ired to attend to the bu&s;ine&s;s. To the&s;e gentlemen I have wrote repeat|edly in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing terms upon the &s;ubject, and I have no rea&s;on to doubt but every exertion on their part has been employed to promote the end. The delay of tho&s;e who have enli&s;ted has ari&s;en from the late period when they engaged, and from their being inoculated &s;ince, which could not be di&s;pen&s;ed with, without &s;ubjecting them to the calamities and ravage of the &s;mall-pox in the natu|ral way.</P>
<P>At three o'clock this morning I received a letter from general M^cDougal inclo&s;ing three from colonel Huntington, copies of the whole of which I have tran&s;mitted. By the&s;e
<PB N="61" REF="029737_0399_0FE299E3B4880368">
you will perceive the impre&s;&s;ion which a part of general Howe's army has made into Connecticut, and the pro&s;pect they had of de&s;troying &s;uch of our &s;tores as were depo&s;ited in Danbury, which unfortunately were but too large and con&s;iderable, if the event has taken place. A circum|&s;tance, perhaps more to be regretted, is that the enemy marched through a &s;trong and rough country, and were near that place, without the &s;malle&s;t oppo&s;ition. I have no other information upon the &s;ubject than what the&s;e pa|pers contain: but we have little ground to expect that they have not accompli&s;hed their purpo&s;e. Further intel|ligence will be probably received to-day or to-morrow, when I &s;hall be happy to hear that they have paid for their enterpri&s;e. Of this, I confe&s;s however, I am not very &s;anguine in my expectations.</P>
<P>This po&s;t had been con&s;idered as a proper depo&s;itory for &s;tores, by gentlemen acquainted with it; and its &s;ecuri|ty not thought que&s;tionable whil&s;t troops were pa&s;&s;ing through it. I had al&s;o directed that as many of the draughts in Connecticut as the place was capable of ac|commodating, &s;hould be collected there and inoculated, to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of a guard, hoping by the time of their recovery, that the &s;ituation of the army would be &s;uch as to admit a &s;trong one to be &s;tationed there and continued: but, unhappily for us, &s;uch languor and &s;upinene&s;s prevails every where, that we &s;eem unable to effect any point we wi&s;h, though never &s;o important and intere&s;ting. So ear|ly as the &s;ixth of March, I wrote to governor Trumbull, earne&s;tly reque&s;ting two thou&s;and militia to be &s;ent to gen|eral M^cDougal to be employed at Peek&s;kill and on the com|munication in We&s;t-Che&s;ter county for &s;ix weeks. With this requi&s;ition he mo&s;t readily complied &s;o far as his or|ders were nece&s;&s;ary, and (I am certain) his influence would extend. This I have repeated, and this &s;upply he has ex|erted him&s;elf to furni&s;h: yet &s;o ineffectual have his endeav|ours been, that not more than eight hundred had come out by general M^cDougal's return on the &s;eventeenth in|&s;tant; nor did he expect more, from the accounts he had. In a word, Sir, no expedient or pains have been unattempt|ed by me to bring on troops, and to keep our affairs on a favourable footing.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="029737_0400_0FE24B7E3B5583A0">
I would again mention the ca&s;e of our pri&s;oners with the enemy, and pray that the &s;ecret committee would &s;end to Mr. Boudinot &s;upplies of money for them as early as po&s;&s;i|ble. They are in great di&s;tre&s;s, and many officers have lately e&s;caped, contrary to the tenor of their parole; &s;ome of whom are now here, urging that nece&s;&s;ity compelled them to the mea&s;ure.</P>

The inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from general M^cDougal, and of &s;everal others which he tran&s;mitted, will give Congre&s;s all the intelligence I have upon the &s;ubject.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS ye&s;terday honoured with your letter of the twenty-ninth ultimo, inclo&s;ing &s;undry re&s;olves. Agreeable to the directions of Congre&s;s, I have written to the States of New-Hamp&s;hire and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and urged them to complete and forward their troops de&s;tined for Ticondero|ga, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. The brigadiers gone there for the pre&s;ent are Fermoy, Poor, Patter&s;on and Learned. Nixon and Glover were al&s;o intended for that po&s;t under my fir&s;t plan, which was, that all the regiments, to be rai&s;ed in tho&s;e States by the re&s;olve in September, &s;hould compo&s;e that army. But having by the advice of my officers direct|ed the route of eight regiments from the latter to Peek&s;kill, to wait till the de&s;igns of general Howe were unfolded, the&s;e two officers were to follow them. I did not partic|ularize the brigadiers who were to go fir&s;t, or the regiments;
<PB N="63" REF="029737_0401_0FE299E538295990">
but left the matter to major-general Heath, who was in|&s;tructed in general terms to pur&s;ue &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;eemed mo&s;t likely to promote the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The colonels appointed to the New-Hamp&s;hire regiments I never knew. Tho&s;e ordered to Ticonderoga from Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts by general Heath, and who I pre&s;ume have marched, were Bailey, We&s;&s;on, Jack&s;on, Mar&s;hall, Brewer-Bradford and Francis. What proportions of their regi|ments have marched, I cannot a&s;certain: but I am per|&s;uaded they were detached as fa&s;t as they were rai&s;ed, and circum&s;tances would admit. Francis's, the fir&s;t of April, was returned five hundred &s;trong; and, by a letter from colonel Mar&s;hall about the fifteenth of la&s;t month, he ex|pected to march in a day or two with the la&s;t divi&s;ion of his regiment that was ready, which would make about four hundred, including tho&s;e who had gone. The remainder (about &s;ixty) were to follow with the proper officers as &s;oon as they were fit&mdash;they having been inoculated.</P>
<P>I have written to generals M^cDougal and Clinton to have the provi&s;ion removed from Derby, &amp;c. and directed that they &s;hould point out proper places for its reception in Ul&s;ter; al&s;o that &s;mall works and guards of militia will be e&s;&s;ential for its protection. * * *</P>
<P>The damage we &s;u&s;tained at Danbury, nor the enemy's lo&s;s, have not been tran&s;mitted with any accuracy: but, from the late&s;t accounts from thence, the former was not &s;o great, and the latter more con&s;iderable, than was appre|hended at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I congratulate Congre&s;s upon the fortunate arrival of the Amphitrite with military and ordnance &s;tores:&mdash;it is an important event. That of the French &s;hip at Bo&s;ton, and of the &s;loop from Martinique, added to the capture of the two provi&s;ion &s;hips, are to be regarded as intere&s;ting too. I would here take the liberty to mention that I think all the military and ordnance &s;tores &s;hould be moved without a moment's delay to Springfield or &s;ome interior part of the country. Springfield &s;hould be the place, becau&s;e the elab|oratory is there, and they will be more convenient to u&s;e as exigences require. In their pre&s;ent &s;ituation their &s;e|curity is que&s;tionable; and, if an attack &s;hould be made in the ea&s;tern quarter, their lo&s;s is much to be apprehended.
<PB N="64" REF="029737_0402_0FE24B7FD6694248">
Before I quit this &s;ubject, I would beg leave to ob&s;erve al&s;o that the di&s;po&s;al and direction of military &s;tores &s;hould be only with one body or with one per&s;on. At pre&s;ent this power is exerci&s;ed through &s;o many channels, that much confu&s;ion is introduced; and it cannot be avoided: nor will it be po&s;&s;ible that matters in this line &s;hould be con|ducted with any degree of propriety, unle&s;s Congre&s;s come into &s;ome regulations re&s;pecting them. The inclo&s;ed ex|tract of a letter from general Heath will prove the expedi|ency. Many other in&s;tances might be mentioned, were it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The de&s;ertions from ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> army of late have been very con&s;iderable. General Howe's proclamation, and the bounty allowed to tho&s;e who carry in their arms, have had an unhappy influence on too many of the &s;oldiery: in a particular manner on tho&s;e who are not natives. * * *</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h &s;ome means could be devi&s;ed to cau&s;e more frequent de&s;ertions of <HI>[the enemy's]</HI> troops.

He has certainly di&s;cov|ered, in every in&s;tance where he has had an opportunity, much bravery, activity and enterpri&s;e. But what will be done about his rank?&mdash;He will not act mo&s;t probably un|der tho&s;e he commanded but a few weeks ago.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t the appointment of Mr. Ludwick as &s;uperintend|ant of bakers will have the &s;alutary con&s;equences you men|tion: I have been long a&s;&s;ured that many abu&s;es have been
<PB N="65" REF="029737_0403_0FE299E6BA851828">
committed for want of &s;ome proper regulations in that de|partment.</P>
<P>By major Troop, one of general Gates's aides, and who left Albany on Tue&s;day la&s;t, I am informed the accounts of general Carleton's approach towards Ticonderoga were premature. He &s;ays general Gates received a letter before he came away, from brigadier-general Wayne, of the twen|ty-fourth ultimo, in which he mentioned nothing of it;&mdash;that three thou&s;and troops had arrived there, all in high &s;pirits and health, except nine;&mdash;and that that po&s;t could never be carried without the lo&s;s of much blood. The proceedings of Congre&s;s and your letter of the twenty-ninth ultimo were the fir&s;t and only information I had of Mr. Carleton's being on the lake, having heard nothing upon the &s;ubject from general Gates or any other per&s;on.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t I mentioned that &s;ixteen dollars bounty were given by general Howe to de&s;erters with arms. I have rea&s;on to believe from information received &s;ince, and which &s;eems to be generally credited, that he has advanced the bounty to twenty-four dollars.</P>
<P>It is much to be wi&s;hed that our printers were more di&s;|creet in many of their publications. We &s;ee, almo&s;t in ev|ery paper, proclamations or accounts tran&s;mitted by the en|emy, of an injurious nature. If &s;ome hint or caution could be given them on the &s;ubject, it might be of material &s;ervice.</P>
<P>By a per&s;on who has ju&s;t arrived here, it is reported that general Woo&s;ter is dead of his wounds.</P>
<P>I would mention to Congre&s;s that in a day or two our military che&s;t will be exhau&s;ted. I beg that a &s;upply may be forwarded as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible: if there &s;hould be a fai|lure, we &s;hall have many things to apprehend.</P>

<P>I have inclo&s;ed a li&s;t of &s;tores lo&s;t at Danbury. You will al&s;o receive a New-York paper, by which you will &s;ee the enemy's account of that affair, and how little they have regarded a true &s;tate. We are told certainly they had forty-&s;even men killed: and, from the accounts that have been received, I think it may be fairly concluded that their lo&s;s was much more con&s;iderable than they make it.</P>

<P>THIS will be delivered you by colonel Conway&punc; an Iri&s;h gentleman in the &s;ervice of France, who came pa&s;|&s;enger in the Amphitrite, and was introduced to me ye&s;|terday, by a letter from Mr. Deane and one from general Heath, copies of which are tran&s;mitted.</P>
<P>This gentleman waits on Congre&s;s to obtain an ap|pointment in the army of the States, and, from Mr. Deane's recommendation, is an officer of merit. He &s;ays no par|ticular command was agreed on between him and Mr. Deane; nor does he wi&s;h otherwi&s;e than that Congre&s;s &s;hould exerci&s;e their own di&s;cretion: at the &s;ame time he ob&s;erves that it will be mortifying to him to hold a rank under that of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ieurs De Fermoy and De Borre, who were inferior officers in their own &s;ervice, and &s;ubject to his command. He can give the character of &s;everal of the officers who were pa&s;&s;engers with him.</P>
<P>I cannot pretend to &s;peak of colonel Conway's merits or abilities, of my own knowledge, having had but little opportunity to be acquainted with him. From what I can di&s;cover, he appears to be a man of candour: and if he has been in &s;ervice as long as he &s;ays he has, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e him infinitely better qualified to &s;erve us, than many who have been promoted, as he &s;peaks our language. He &s;eems extremely anxious to return to camp, as the campaign may be expected to become active every day; and wi&s;hes Congre&s;s to determine whatever command they may think proper to honour him with, as &s;oon as they &s;hall think it expedient.</P>

<P>THE inclo&s;ed is copy of a letter which was hand|ed to me by mon&s;ieur Mottin de la Balme, from Silas Deane, e&s;quire. For a more particular account of his merit and &s;ervices, I mu&s;t refer you to him&s;elf. I have &s;ounded him as to his expectations, and find that nothing under a lieutenant-colonelcy of hor&s;e will content him.
<PB N="67" REF="029737_0405_0FE299F18DA3ED98">
If you &s;hould, from his own account, or from what you can collect from others, think proper to confer this rank upon him, there is no vacancy in any other corps except that of colonel Sheldon.</P>
<P>I am afraid we &s;hall never be able to find places va|cant, equal to the expectations of the French gentlemen who are now here, much le&s;s for tho&s;e that will follow. The high rank conferred upon tho&s;e who fir&s;t came over, many of whom had no preten&s;ions either from their &s;er|vices or meri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, has naturally rai&s;ed the expectations of tho&s;e who come properly recommended, to &s;uch a pitch, that I know not what will &s;atisfy them. Indeed it is not to be imagined that a gentleman and an old &s;oldier can &s;ubmit to be commanded by a per&s;on in this country, whom he remembers to have been his inferior in France. I know not how we can remedy this evil, or put a &s;top to the growth of it, but by being very circum&s;pect for the future, on whom we confer rank above that of a &s;ubaltern.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you on the fifth in&s;tant nothing material has occurred.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed you will be plea&s;ed to receive a general return of our forces in Jer&s;ey, the &s;ixth in&s;tant, which is the fir&s;t I have been able to obtain with any degree of accuracy.</P>
<P>I have not heard from general De Haas &s;ince his pro|motion. As &s;oon as I was informed of it, I wrote and reque&s;ted him to repair to camp: but, having received no an&s;wer, I am apprehen&s;ive my letter mi&s;carried. I wi&s;h Congre&s;s to give him notice of his appointment, and direc|tions to join the army, if he accepts his commi&s;&s;ion and is not prevented by indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Through the board of war I have been favoured with a copy of general Gates's letter of the twenty-ninth ultimo. Hud&s;on's-river and the pa&s;&s;es in the Highlands I always con&s;idered as objects of great importance, and accordingly have provided for their &s;ecurity in the be&s;t manner my judg|ment could direct, and the circum&s;tances of the army admit.
<PB N="68" REF="029737_0406_0FE299988C044F28">
If they are le&s;s &s;ecure than we wi&s;h them to be, it is owing to our inability, and not to inattention. I have written to general M^cDougal, and will do it again, to employ much of his care upon this &s;ubject. War, in theory, and the modes of defence, are obvious and ea&s;y; but, in practice, they are more difficult. Unhappily for us, the means in our power do not always accord with our wi&s;hes or what would be our intere&s;t to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>As yet none of the ea&s;tern troops have pa&s;&s;ed the North-river, except two &s;mall detachments from Connecticut and Rhode-I&s;land, amounting to about two hundred and &s;even|ty, which mi&s;&s;ed my orders till they had got over. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> I &s;hall &s;end back after we are more reinforced, unle&s;s the movements of the enemy in this quarter make their detention nece&s;&s;ary. The re&s;t of the ea&s;tern troops which have marched (except the &s;even regiments from Massachu&s;etts and three from New-Hamp&s;hire, ordered immediately to Ticonderoga) are at and on their way to Peek&s;kill, as mentioned in my letter of the third&mdash;where they are to remain with all the York troops except Van&s;chaick's and Gan&s;evoort's now at the northward, till general Howe's de&s;igns and intended operations are better under&s;tood. This di&s;po&s;ition appearing to me and my general officers the be&s;t that could be made in our &s;tate of uncertainty, was adopted. The two troops of hor&s;e, recommended by Congre&s;s to be &s;ent to general Gates, &s;hall go as &s;oon as circum&s;tances will admit. At pre&s;ent we have not more than are con&s;tantly employed at the different po&s;ts.</P>
<P>General Heath, in a letter of the thirtieth ultimo, mentions that the military che&s;t at the ea&s;tward is exhau&s;t|ed, and that a &s;upply will be wanted much to defray the expen&s;es which will ari&s;e on the removal of the military and ordnance &s;tores to Springfield. He &s;ays Mr. Han|cock was to write upon the &s;ubject, and reque&s;ted I would al&s;o mention it to Congre&s;s in my fir&s;t letter.</P>
<P>Accounts have been frequently exhibited of late by the officers, re&s;pecting &s;ub&s;i&s;tence whil&s;t recruiting and on their march. As I do not recollect the provi&s;ion Congre&s;s have made in &s;uch ca&s;es, I wi&s;h to be informed, and to be fa|voured with a copy of their &s;everal re&s;olves upon the &s;ubject.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS will be delivered you by general Arnold, who arrived here to-day in his way to Philadelphia. He &s;eems to be anxious to &s;ettle his public accounts which are of con&s;iderable amount, and waits on Congre&s;s, hoping they will appoint a committee of their body, or of such gentle|men as they &s;hall judge proper, to take the matter into con|&s;ideration. This he con&s;iders the more nece&s;&s;ary, as he has heard &s;ome reports have been propagated, injurious to his character as a man of integrity. If any &s;uch a&s;per&s;ions lie again&s;t him, it is but rea&s;onable that he &s;hould have an opportunity of vindicating him&s;elf and evincing his inno|cence.</P>
<P>I find he does not con&s;ider the promotion Congre&s;s have been plea&s;ed to confer upon him &s;ufficient to obviate the neglect ari&s;ing from their having omitted him in their late appointments of major-generals. He ob&s;erves it does not give him the rank he had a claim to from &s;eniority in the line of brigadiers, and that he is &s;ubject to be commanded by tho&s;e who had been inferior to him. He further adds, that Congre&s;s, in their la&s;t re&s;olve re&s;pecting him, have ac|knowledged him competent to the &s;tation of major-general, and therefore have done away every objection implied by their former omi&s;&s;ion. The&s;e con&s;iderations are not with|out their weight, though I pretend not to judge what mo|tives may have influenced the conduct of Congre&s;s upon this occa&s;ion. It is needle&s;s to &s;ay any thing of this gen|tleman's military character: it is univer&s;ally known that he has always di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a judicious, brave officer, of great activity, enterpri&s;e and per&s;everance.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this morning honoured with your letter of the tenth in&s;tant, accompanied by the proceedings of Con|gre&s;s of the day before.</P>
<P>The conduct of two many officers in withholding the pay of their &s;oldiers, I am per&s;uaded, is reprehen&s;ible, and has been the cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s and of many de&s;ertions. Every mea&s;ure in my power will be exerted to prevent &s;uch abu&s;es in future, and every aid given to puni&s;h the offenders in an exemplary manner. But Congre&s;s will excu&s;e me when I tell them it will be impo&s;&s;ible to com|ply with their recommendation upon this &s;ubject, unle&s;s the general officers withdraw their attention from matters of the utmo&s;t importance, and &s;uch as require their con|&s;tant care. Were this not the ca&s;e, the di&s;per&s;ed &s;ituation of the officers at this time through the different States on the recruiting &s;ervice would prohibit the inquiry. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> do I apprehend the regulations empowering and enjoin|ing the regimental pay-ma&s;ters to bring them to an account will be found competent to the end. Such officers will be proper to &s;tate the accounts in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and to receive vouchers, &amp;c. but will not do to &s;ettle them final|ly, as their connexions with the regiments will &s;ubject them much to the influence of the officers.</P>
<P>I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, if two or three gentlemen of integrity and of ability in accounts, were appointed auditors to at|tend the army till the bu&s;ine&s;s is fini&s;hed, it would be the be&s;t expedient that could be fallen on. They would be a check on the pay-ma&s;ters, and, I am per&s;uaded, will be the means of the accounts being fairly and ju&s;tly liquidated. If a &s;ettlement can be once obtained, I tru&s;t the &s;ame con|fu&s;ion will never take place again, as the pay-ma&s;ters will receive and pay all money due to the regiments, and ac|count for it, and as the army is on a more permanent footing than it ever was before: for this, like mo&s;t other inconveniences and difficulties which we have experienced, is to be imputed in a great mea&s;ure to &s;hort enli&s;tments and the frequent di&s;&s;olution of our troops.</P>
<P>A return of the army in Jer&s;ey, as late as the &s;ixth in|&s;tant, I tran&s;mitted ye&s;terday morning in a letter by Mr.
<PB N="71" REF="029737_0409_0FE299F49847D200">
Randolph of Che&s;nut-&s;treet, which you will probably re|ceive to-day, and from which Congre&s;s will be able to determine the expediency of calling out the militia from Delaware and Penn&s;ylvania. Though it gives me pain that we &s;hould be under the nece&s;&s;ity of recurring to &s;uch a mea&s;ure, yet I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it to be advi&s;eable. Our army is weak, and by no means equal to that of the ene|my; and, till their de&s;igns are known and we are more reinforced with regular troops, we &s;hould be prepared in the be&s;t manner we can. I would ob&s;erve, if the militia are called out, it &s;hould be for a fixed determinate time: for, though they will certainly return when that expires, yet that is more tolerable than for them to go off in par|ties every day, as their whim and caprice &s;ugge&s;t,&mdash;which has always been the ca&s;e when the time was not &s;tated. I would al&s;o ob&s;erve, if it is po&s;&s;ible, they &s;hould be en|gaged to march out of their States if ordered. If their &s;ervice is located, they will move with great reluctance, if they do at all.</P>
<P>On Saturday a &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;h happened with a detach|ment of our troops who attacked a number of the enemy near Pi&s;catawa, in which our men behaved well, and oblig|ed the enemy to give way twice (as reported to me) with lo&s;s. The enemy receiving a &s;trong reinforcement, our people retreated to their po&s;t. I cannot give the particu|lars, as they have not been &s;ufficiently a&s;certained. Their piquets were al&s;o attacked ye&s;terday by &s;ome of our parties from Boundbrook, and forced within their lines.</P>

I fear it will be hardly po&s;&s;ible to &s;atisfy the views and claims of &s;ome of the French gentlemen.

I &s;hall inform mon&s;ieur Armand (and reconcile him to it in the be&s;t manner I can) that there is no vacancy for him at pre&s;ent: and I would beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t, that, where promotions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> made in future from political and honourary motives, it would be well for Congre&s;s to explain to the gentlemen that it may be &s;ome time before they can be put in actual command.

<P>I BEG leave to inform Congre&s;s, that, immediately after the receipt of their re&s;olve of the twenty-&s;ixth of March, recommending the office of adjutant-general to be filled by the appointment of a per&s;on of abilities and un&s;u&s;|pected attachment to our cau&s;e, I wrote to colonel Timo|thy Pickering of Salem, offering him the po&s;t in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and tran&s;mitting at the &s;ame time a letter for col|onel William Lee, whom Congre&s;s had been plea&s;ed to mention, to be delivered him in ca&s;e my offer could not be accepted. This conduct, in preference of colonel Picker|ing, I was induced to adopt from the high character I had of him, both as a great military genius cultivated by an in|du&s;trious attention to the &s;tudy of war, and as a gentleman of liberal education, di&s;tingui&s;hed zeal, and great method and activity in bu&s;ine&s;s. This character of him I had from gentlemen of di&s;tinction and merit, and on who&s;e judgment I could rely.</P>
<P>When my letter reached colonel Pickering, at fir&s;t view he thought his &s;ituation in re&s;pect to public affairs would not permit him to accept the po&s;t. That for colonel Lee he &s;ent immediately to him, who, in con&s;equence of it, re|paired to head-quarters. By colonel Lee I received a let|ter from colonel Pickering, &s;tating more particularly the
<PB N="74" REF="029737_0412_0FE299A6D14088D0">
cau&s;es which prevented him accepting the office when it was offered, and a&s;&s;uring me that he would in a little time ac|commodate his affairs in &s;uch a manner as to come into any military po&s;t in which he might be &s;erviceable, and thought equal to.</P>
<P>Here I am to mark with peculiar &s;atisfaction, in ju&s;tice to colonel Lee who has de&s;ervedly acquired the reputation of a good officer, that he expre&s;&s;ed a di&s;tru&s;t of his abilities to fill the appointment intended for him; and, on hearing that colonel Pickering would accept it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e not only offered but wi&s;hed to relinqui&s;h his claim to it in favour of him, whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e declared he con&s;idered, from a very intimate and friendly acquaintance, as a fir&s;t military character; and that he knew no gentleman better or &s;o well qualified for the po&s;t among us. Matters being thus circum&s;tanced, and colonel Lee plea&s;ed with the command he was in, I wrote to colonel Pickering on his return, who accepted the office, and is daily expected.</P>
<P>In this bu&s;ine&s;s I beg Congre&s;s to be a&s;&s;ured, though col|onel Lee was po&s;tponed in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, their recom|mendation had its due weight; and that no motive, other than a regard to the &s;ervice, induced me to prefer colonel Pickering. His acknowledged abilities and equal zeal&mdash;without derogating from the merits of colonel Lee who holds a high place in my e&s;teem&mdash;gave him a preference; and I flatter my&s;elf the cau&s;e will be promoted in his ap|pointment, e&s;pecially as we &s;hall have two good officers in lieu of one, who, I am per&s;uaded, will do honour to them&s;elves in the line in which they move.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the pa&s;&s;es through the Highlands of the ut|mo&s;t importance to &s;ecure, I &s;ent generals Greene and Knox about a fortnight ago to &s;ee what had been done for their defence, and to con&s;ult with the general officers they &s;hould meet, upon &s;uch further mea&s;ures as might be deem|ed nece&s;&s;ary for their greater &s;afety. The inclo&s;ed copy of their report will fully convey their &s;entiments upon the &s;ub|ject; to which I beg leave to refer Congre&s;s. I have &s;ent general Putnam to command in that quarter, and have in|&s;tructed him to u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible means in his power for expediting and effecting the works and ob&s;tructions men|tioned in the report. Fearing that the cables might not
<PB N="75" REF="029737_0413_0FE299FE9FC70668">
be procured in time, I have directed his particular and im|mediate attention to fixing the boom. However, as the cables would render that more &s;ecure, and will be extreme|ly &s;erviceable in the opinion of the officers&mdash;if they are to be had in Philadelphia, I would advi&s;e Congre&s;s to order them to be purcha&s;ed and forwarded without lo&s;s of time: they cannot be got el&s;ewhere. They mu&s;t be proportioned to the width of the river, which is about five hundred and forty yards; and, as they will be of mo&s;t u&s;e if diagonally laid, the gentlemen think they &s;hould not be le&s;s than four hundred and fifty fathoms long, and of the large&s;t &s;ize that can be had. Unle&s;s they are large and &s;ub&s;tantial, they will an&s;wer no purpo&s;e, and will not &s;u&s;tain their weight when &s;tretched.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad to know whether it be the intention of Congre&s;s that one of the already-appointed general officers may be a&s;&s;igned to the command of the light-hor&s;e, or wheth|er they have in contemplation the appointing of one for this purpo&s;e: if the fir&s;t, I &s;hall immediately name one to that duty; if the &s;econd, they will be plea&s;ed to choo&s;e one, as it is time we &s;hould have our arrangements complete.</P>
<P>I have nothing of importance to communicate, unle&s;s it is that &s;eventeen &s;hips are &s;aid to have arrived at New-York on the twenty-&s;econd, and that others were in the offing. A report has al&s;o prevailed, and has come through two or three channels, that governor Tryon (that was) is dead of the wound he received in the Danbury expedition: and one account is that lieutenant-colonel Walcot fell in the engage|ment at Ridgefield. I do not know how far the facts are to be depended on:&mdash;it &s;eems certain that Mr. Tryon was wounded.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE inclo&s;ed is a copy of a letter received ye&s;terday from general Howe. Congre&s;s will perceive, by referring to the copy of his letter of the twenty-fir&s;t of April tran&s;|mitted in mine of the twenty-&s;ixth, that he per&s;evered in his demand for an equal number of pri&s;oners to be returned for tho&s;e &s;ent out by him; which has been the &s;ubject of con|trover&s;y between us. As general Howe has called upon me again for my final deci&s;ion upon the &s;ubject, and Con|gre&s;s are fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, having received tran&s;cripts of every paper re&s;pecting it&punc; I wi&s;h them to take the matter un|der their earlie&s;t con&s;ideration, and to inform me as &s;oon as they can, whether the grounds on which it has been con|ducted by me are agreeable to their ideas, and whether my objections are or are not to be departed from. The affair is particularly &s;tated in my letter of the ninth ultimo to gen|eral Howe, in an&s;wer to the paper addre&s;&s;ed to me by lieu|tenant-colonel Walcot; copies of which were inclo&s;ed in my letter to the pre&s;ident on the tenth of the &s;ame month. The di&s;pute, &s;o far as general Lee is concerned, re&s;ts at pre&s;ent on their declaring him exchangeable, as other pri&s;on|ers are, on the principle of equality of rank; to en&s;ure which, or his &s;afety, lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the He&s;&s;ian field-officers are detained. The other objection to returning their pri&s;oners is, that a great proportion of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e &s;ent out by them were not fit &s;ubjects of exchange when re|lea&s;ed, and were made &s;o by the &s;everity of their treatment and confinement, and therefore a deduction &s;hould be made, from the li&s;t.</P>
<P>Good faith &s;eems to require that we &s;hould return as ma|ny of theirs at lea&s;t as we received effectives from them&mdash;I mean &s;uch as could be con&s;idered capable of being ex|changed; and perhaps &s;ound policy, that the agreement &s;ub&s;i&s;ting for exchanges &s;hould continue. On the other hand it may be &s;aid, that our pri&s;oners in general, in the enemy's hands at pre&s;ent, will have greater &s;ecurity by our retaining them, and that general Howe will be le&s;s apt to relinqui&s;h any part of his claim, the more the number in our hands is dimini&s;hed by an exchange.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I am under great difficulty in this bu&s;ine&s;s. But what is more particularly the cau&s;e of this application
<PB N="77" REF="029737_0415_0FE29A019027BA18">
is the latter part of the fir&s;t paragraph of the inclo&s;ed copy.&mdash;<HI>"and for your determination re&s;pecting the pri&s;oners now here, that I may make my arrangements accordingly."</HI> This is couched in terms of great ambiguity; and I am really at a lo&s;s what interpretation to give it,&mdash;whether he in|tends that his conduct re&s;pecting them &s;hall be as I advi&s;e (this appears more favourable than can well be expected) or that, if the previous demand is not an&s;wered in a &s;atis|factory manner, he &s;hall con&s;ider them on a different foot|ing from that on which our former pri&s;oners were, and the agreement totally di&s;&s;olved. We are told government of|fered the pri&s;oners they took to the India company, and they have procured an act di&s;pen&s;ing with that of the habeas-corpus in particular ca&s;es of per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed inimical to them, &amp;c. How far they or their commanders may adopt the&s;e mea&s;ures, remains to be known: I have only mentioned them as they re&s;pect the general &s;ubject of my letter.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding my recommendation agreeable to what I conceived to be the &s;en&s;e of Congre&s;s, lieutenant-colonel Campbell's treatment continues to be &s;uch as cannot be ju&s;|tified either on the principles of genero&s;ity, or &s;trict retal|iation; as I have authentic information, and I doubt not you will have the &s;ame, that general Lee's &s;ituation is far from being rigorous or uncomfortable: except his not be|ing permitted to go at large on parole, he has rea&s;on to be content with every other circum&s;tance of his treatment.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t moving to Boundbrook, from whence I return|ed ye&s;terday morning. On Monday morning a body of the enemy advanced near that po&s;t. They retreated, on &s;eeing a detachment march to meet them. There was &s;ome firing at long &s;hot, but without any great damage. We had only three men &s;lightly wounded. What their lo&s;s was, I know not: three of their light-hor&s;e were killed. By advices from the ea&s;tward, the troops are coming from Rhode-I&s;land.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I did my&s;elf the honour to write to you the twenty-ninth, I have received the inclo&s;ed intelligence. As it comes from a per&s;on of veracity, and one who is much in the confidence of the enemy, I have no doubt as to the fact of the two brigades having come over from New-York to Amboy, and al&s;o that a number of waggons have been brought from Staten and Long-I&s;land&punc; The&s;e accounts are corroborated by information of the &s;ame kind from &s;everal different quarters. But I do not place &s;o much dependence upon the account of the intended attack upon this place, becau&s;e I think, if &s;uch a matter was really in agitation, it would be kept a profound &s;ecret; I rather am opinion that it is thrown out to deceive. But at any rate, taking it for granted that they are a&s;&s;embling their troops and carriages, what can they have in view but a move, either immediately, or when their reinforcement (if they get any) arrives? and if they do move, I can &s;ee no other object but Philadelphia. It is true they have &s;eemed for &s;ome time pa&s;t to have laid a&s;ide all thoughts of attempting that city by land: but if they had only the attacking this army in contemplation, they would never encumber them&s;elves with a large train of waggons, which,
<PB N="79" REF="029737_0417_0FE29A03187E37C8">
if they were &s;ucce&s;sful, would retard them in their pur|&s;uit, and, if defeated, would be in danger of falling into our hands.</P>
<P>I inclo&s;e you an extract of a letter which I received from general Sullivan. If the two India &s;hips which have been cut down are gone out to &s;ea, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e they are intended for the Delaware, becau&s;e they are not capa|ble of performing a rough or long voyage. This, if true, looks if a &s;udden corre&s;ponding move by land was in|tended; for they will never &s;end their &s;hips long before their troops.</P>
<P>The&s;e, you will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, are mere conjectures upon circum&s;tances: for the actions of the enemy have for a long time pa&s;t been &s;o different from appearances, that I hardly dare to form an opinion. But I would wish to profit by every piece of intelligence, and be prepared to ward off every danger that threatens. I would therefore recommend that the Penn&s;ylvania militia, who are a&s;&s;em|bled at Bri&s;tol for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of guarding the riv|er and oppo&s;ing the pa&s;&s;age of the enemy, &s;hould be put under the command of a good general officer, who would &s;ee that they are kept to their duty, and prepared for a &s;ud|den emergency. Except this is done, they may as well be at home.</P>
<P>I la&s;t night received a letter from general M^cDougal, an extract of which you have inclo&s;ed. By this it appears that a reinforcement is arrived, but whether from Canada or Europe, is uncertain. You will ob&s;erve that he likewi&s;e mentions, that eight tran&s;ports with foot, and a &s;chooner with hor&s;es and hay, had fallen down. We can only form conjectures at pre&s;ent of the place of their de&s;tination: but if they &s;tand &s;outhward, Philadelphia is the mo&s;t probable place.</P>
<P>I have the plea&s;ure to communicate a very agreeable piece of intelligence which I have received from general Par&s;ons, of the de&s;truction of twelve of the enemy's ve&s;&s;els in Sag-harbour upon the ea&s;t end of Long-I&s;land. I give you his letter at length, which I think reflects high honour upon the conduct and bravery of colonel Meigs, his officers, and men.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MONSIEUR Coudray is ju&s;t arrived at camp, and propo&s;es to &s;et out to-morrow for Philadelphia. What his views are, I am uncertain, having had no conver&s;ation with him upon the &s;ubject: but I find an idea prevails that there is an agreement between Mr. Deane and him, that he &s;hall have the chief command of the artillery. How well found|ed this opinion may be, I cannot determine: but if it be true, it may involve the mo&s;t injurious con&s;equences. Gen|eral Knox, who has de&s;ervedly acquired the character of one of the mo&s;t valuable officers in the &s;ervice, and who, combat|ing almo&s;t innumerable difficulties in the department he fills, has placed the artillery upon a footing that does him the greate&s;t honour&mdash;he, I am per&s;uaded, would con&s;ider him|&s;elf injured by an appointment &s;uper&s;eding his command, and would not think him&s;elf at liberty to continue in the &s;ervice. Should &s;uch an event take place in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, there would be too much rea&s;on to appre|hend a train of ills, &s;uch as might convul&s;e and unhinge this important department.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing mon&s;ieur Coudray to have made &s;uch an agreement, the ca&s;e is of great difficulty, and, in my opin|ion, is worthy of the mo&s;t delicate con&s;ideration of Con|gre&s;s. Yet may not means be &s;till devi&s;ed to &s;atisfy this gentleman by appointing him to &s;ome command not derog|atory to his promi&s;ed rank, and which will be agreeable to him? From the recommendations we have had of him, I am obliged to e&s;teem him of high character, and of great knowledge in what he profe&s;&s;es: and, from this con&s;ider|ation and the manner in which he is mentioned to us, it ap|pears that much addre&s;s and delicacy mu&s;t be u&s;ed, to con|ciliate matters.</P>
<P>Many rea&s;ons, be&s;ides tho&s;e I have noted, might be a&s;&s;igned for continuing general Knox fir&s;t in command in this department, which, on reflection, will readily occur. I would only ob&s;erve, without in&s;inuating the mo&s;t di&s;|tant &s;hadow of di&s;tru&s;t of mon&s;ieur Coudray's honour, candour, or integrity, that, on the general maxims of prudence and policy, it may be que&s;tioned with much pro|priety whether &s;o important a command as that of the ar|tillery

&s;hould be ve&s;ted in any but a native, or one attach|ed by the ties of intere&s;t to the&s;e States.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to excu&s;e the freedom I have u&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion, and, I tru&s;t, will impute it to the importance of the &s;ubject which gave ri&s;e to it.</P>

The &s;hameful deficiency in all our armies affords but too ju&s;t grounds for di&s;agreeable apprehen&s;ions: if the quotas a&s;|&s;igned the different States are not immediately filled, we &s;hall have every thing to fear.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WOULD take the liberty of addre&s;&s;ing a few lines to Congre&s;s on a matter which appears to me of im|portance,
<PB N="82" REF="029737_0420_0FE299AB9F1B7870">
and which is con&s;idered in the &s;ame light by many of our officers, and others not in the military line. The &s;ubject I allude to is the condition of many per&s;ons now with the enemy, who, deluded by their arts and a mi&s;guided attachment to their mea&s;ures, fled from the pro|tection of the States, to find &s;ecurity with them, and who in many in&s;tances, are in arms again&s;t us.</P>
<P>It has been &s;ugge&s;ted through various channels,&mdash;and the &s;ugge&s;tion &s;eems to be credited, e&s;pecially as &s;ome have already e&s;caped,&mdash;that many of the&s;e unhappy people, con|vinced of their error and the wicked part they have takes, would embrace the earlie&s;t opportunity of leaving the ene|my and returning among us, were they &s;ure of being re|ceived into our friend&s;hip again, and of enjoying their prop|erty and the rights of citizens.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject, in the con&s;ideration of it, &s;trikes me as important, intere&s;ting, and delicate,&mdash;involving many con|&s;equences worthy of mature deliberation and attention. As &s;uch,&mdash;and deeming my&s;elf incompetent to it,&mdash;I think it my duty to &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s for their di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, to take &s;uch mea&s;ures therein as they &s;hall e&s;teem nece&s;&s;ary and right.</P>
<P>If the&s;e people, particularly tho&s;e in arms, are ingeni|ous in what has been hinted, and it is their wi&s;h, or that of any con&s;iderable part of them, to return,&mdash;I &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e that it would be expedient, and founded in found policy, to give every &s;uitable a&s;&s;urance to induce them to come. Such an event would be attended with &s;alutary ef|fects, would weaken the enemy, di&s;tre&s;s them greatly, and would probably have a mo&s;t happy influence in preventing others from joining their arms. On the other hand, the indulgence may be liable to great abu&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ing it not to be duly guarded: or if the effects produced by it &s;hould be partial, they will not be adequate to the ends in view. Yet, as the enemy on their part are u&s;ing every device they are capable of, to &s;educe both &s;oldiers and citizens from our &s;ervice into theirs, and have &s;ucceeded but too well, it is generally thought in the military line that &s;omething &s;hould be attempted to counteract them. Whether Con|gre&s;s will be of the &s;ame &s;entiment, and, if they &s;hould, what and how exten&s;ive the mode and indulgence ought to be, is entirely with them.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="029737_0421_0FE29A0F25059D88">
There is one difficulty that occurs to me, &s;uppo&s;ing the mea&s;ure to be adopted. What line of di&s;crimination can be drawn upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, though circum&s;tances &s;hould differ and &s;eem to require it? While the poor, de|luded, ignorant, duped by artifices and a thou&s;and cau&s;es to lead them wrong, have a claim to their country's par|don and indulgence, there are many of well-informed un|der&s;tanding, who, from their early-avowed ho&s;tile di&s;po|&s;itions and inveterate di&s;regard of her rights, and tho&s;e who have taken a double and triple part, cannot have the &s;ame preten&s;ions; who&s;e only view in returning may be to &s;erve their own &s;ordid purpo&s;es, and the better to pro|mote tho&s;e plans they have &s;teadily pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>One thing more I would ob&s;erve, which is, that if Con|gre&s;s judge an adoption of mea&s;ures eligible on the &s;ubject of my letter, the &s;ooner it is come into, the better, for the mo&s;t obvious rea&s;ons; and the time allowed for tho&s;e to return who wi&s;h the indulgence, &s;hould be fixed at a &s;hort period,&mdash;not longer, in my opinion, than till the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Left blank in the original.</NOTE> day of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Left blank in the original.</NOTE> next: otherwi&s;e they may avail them&s;elves of the circum&s;tance, and wait events to decide their choice. If any good con&s;equences are produced, the means can be renewed and further extended.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to excu&s;e me for thus freely com|municating my &s;entiments, e&s;pecially when I a&s;&s;ure them that they are dictated by what I e&s;teem my duty.</P>

I am in|clined to think, if the mea&s;ure propo&s;ed &s;hould be deemed expedient, that it will be better that the indulgencies and a&s;&s;urances for their return &s;hould be communicated through the medium of &s;ome &s;econd, &s;ecret hand, qualified to offer them and negociate the bu&s;ine&s;s, rather than by an act of public authority. Opportunities, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, may be found, by which they may obtain due information in that way, and which will not hold out to the enemy the &s;ame cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion and of vigilance to prevent their e&s;|caping. Whatever mode &s;hall be con&s;idered mo&s;t advi&s;e|able, &s;hould be immediately adopted. What time &s;hould

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THIS morning had the honour of your letter of the fifth, with its inclo&s;ures. The re&s;olution of the thir|tieth of May, re&s;pecting the French gentlemen who came pa&s;&s;engers in the Amphitrite, reached camp before your letter, and has excited much unea&s;ine&s;s in the artillery corps. The inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from general Knox will convey their anxiety upon the &s;ubject,&mdash;which I think it nece&s;&s;ary to tran&s;mit, as well from duty as on account of his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The difficulties upon this occa&s;ion ari&s;e from the pecu|liar circum&s;tances of mo&s;t of the officers compo&s;ing the artillery regiments at this time. I do not know, for my own part, what operation Congre&s;s preci&s;ely meant the re&s;olution &s;hould have; but if the commi&s;&s;ions which the&s;e gentlemen are to receive &s;hould give them rank from the date of tho&s;e they had from the king of France, or from
<PB N="85" REF="029737_0423_0FE1BFADD29873C8">
their compact with Mr. Deane, there are but few officers now in the artillery who will not be &s;uper&s;eded in their command, unle&s;s &s;ome method is adopted to prevent it. This, I am per&s;uaded, Congre&s;s had not in contempla|tion, becau&s;e it is oppo&s;ed to policy and to ju&s;tice; and I am led to believe the re&s;olution was come into for want of due information how matters were circum&s;tanced in this in&s;tance.</P>
<P>The officers now in the artillery I am obliged to con|&s;ider of great merit: experience has proved them to be mo&s;t warmly attached to the rights of their country; and their conduct in the line of their profe&s;&s;ion has been &s;uch as does the highe&s;t honour to them&s;elves and the gentleman who immediately commands them. Without derogating in the lea&s;t from the character of the French officers who are to be commi&s;&s;ioned, and whom I wi&s;h to receive every countenance they merit, there is &s;trong rea&s;on to doubt (laying a&s;ide every con&s;ideration of policy) whether they have &s;een as much real &s;ervice as our own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the cour&s;e of two campaigns. It would be hard, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ay unju&s;t, that the latter &s;hould lo&s;e their command when they have a claim to every mark of favour, and after they have taken great pains to form their companies: the &s;ervice requires that they &s;hould not; and I am convinced the event would be attended with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P>But what is to be done? This is a ca&s;e of difficulty, view it as you will. I am not for rejecting the French gentlemen:&mdash;far otherwi&s;e&mdash;I am for employing them: and public faith, and the encouragements given to bring them over, demand that it &s;hould be done. After much thought and con&s;ideration upon the &s;ubject, two modes oc|cur to me, as the only po&s;&s;ible ones by which it can be ef|fected, and by which the inconveniences I have mentioned can be remedied. One is, that a new corps of artillery &s;hould be formed, and the&s;e gentlemen attached to it. This, we have rea&s;on to fear, cannot be done, from the difficulties we have experienced in rai&s;ing men, and from their having no intere&s;t or connexions with the people. Their &s;ituation in &s;uch ca&s;e, if they are men of &s;entiment and active di&s;po&s;itions, would be irk&s;ome and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. The other is, that our pre&s;ent officers now under con&s;ider|ation
<PB N="86" REF="029737_0424_0FE299B85D790370">
&s;hould have their commi&s;&s;ions antedated, to give them precedency of rank: and this may be done with the great|er propriety, as mo&s;t of them were intended to hold the po&s;ts they now &s;u&s;tain, before the French gentlemen had any claim upon us. It is true they were not commi&s;&s;ioned, becau&s;e the old corps exi&s;ted under the fir&s;t arrangement. Further it is &s;aid&mdash;and there is no doubt of the fact&mdash;that the&s;e gentlemen were promoted by brevet ju&s;t before their departure from France, merely to give them rank here; antecedent to which, our officers were &s;uperior to them in this point; and the&s;e brevets only confer local <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nk, confined to the French-American colonies.</P>
<P>This latter m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">de appears the mo&s;t eligible: if it is adopt|ed, they will be di&s;tributed through the corps as a&s;&s;i&s;tant officers. Their want of a knowledge in our language inca|pacitates them for command in the fir&s;t in&s;tance; and not only &s;o, but to place them at the head of companies, over officers that have been at great trouble, pains and expen&s;e in rai&s;ing the men, would be both unmilitary and unju&s;t. I &s;hall now quit the &s;ubject, wi&s;hing that whatever will be&s;t conciliate matters and advance the public good, may be done; &s;ugge&s;ting at the &s;ame time, with all deference, as it is much ea&s;ier to prevent evils than to remedy them after they have happened, it will be well, in all ca&s;es of foreign and indeed other applications, that the con&s;equences, which granting them will involve, &s;hould be maturely weighed and taken in every point of view. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e of difficulty, things I am per&s;uaded, might have been adju&s;ted with the greate&s;t facility, had the committee of foreign ap|plications been fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the circum&s;tances re|&s;pecting the artillery regiments.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Gates, of the &s;econd in&s;tant, tran&s;mitting a copy of one from general Poor, the enemy, who were at Split-Rock according to their la&s;t advices which I forwarded, have returned down the Lake. Cap|tain Whitcomb had been &s;ent out to reconnoitre, and re|ported on his return that only one boat remained.</P>
<P>From &s;undry accounts from New-York, there is rea&s;on to believe the enemy are on the point of making &s;ome ex|pedition. Their preparation of &s;hips for troops, light-hor&s;e, &amp;c. indicates that they intend to go by water. What their
<PB N="87" REF="029737_0425_0FE29A126EA79A80">
object is, yet remains a &s;ecret. The inclo&s;ed copy of an examination is very particular, and as recent as any that I have received. The per&s;on who gave the information be|longs to Cape-May county, and appeared to be a &s;en&s;ible intelligent lad. A de&s;erter of the &s;eventy-fir&s;t this moment came in: you al&s;o have his examination inclo&s;ed.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this morning honoured with your favour of the &s;ixth in&s;tant with its inclo&s;ures. I am extremely happy in the approbation Congre&s;s have been plea&s;ed to expre&s;s of my conduct re&s;pecting the propo&s;ed cartel for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of pri&s;oners, and &s;hall govern my&s;elf by the principles which influenced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e on that occa&s;ion, and &s;uch other as &s;hall ap|pear right and ju&s;t, &s;hould there be any further negociation on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I &s;hall order a return to be made of the chaplains in &s;er|vice, which &s;hall be tran&s;mitted as &s;oon as it is obtained. At pre&s;ent, as the regiments are greatly di&s;per&s;ed, part in one place and part in another, and accurate &s;tates of them have not been made, it will not be in my power to for|ward it immediately. I &s;hall here take occa&s;ion to mention that I communicated the re&s;olution appointing a brigade|chaplain in the place of all others, to the &s;everal brigadiers. They are all of opinion that it will be impo&s;&s;ible for them to di&s;charge the duty; that many inconveniences and much di&s;&s;atisfaction will be the re&s;ult; and that no e&s;tabli&s;hment appears &s;o good in this in&s;tance as the old one. Among many other weighty objections to the mea&s;ure, it has been &s;ugge&s;ted that it has a tendency to introduce religious di&s;|putes into the army, which, above all things, &s;hould be avoided,&mdash;and in many in&s;tances would compel men to a mode of wor&s;hip which they do not profe&s;s. The old e&s;|tabli&s;hment gives every regiment an opportunity of having a chaplain of their own religious &s;entiments,&mdash;is founded on a plan of a more generous toleration,&mdash;and the choice of chaplains to officiate has been generally in the regiments. Suppo&s;ing one chaplain could do the duties of a brigade,
<PB N="88" REF="029737_0426_0FE299B9F0E37CD8">
(which &s;uppo&s;ition however is inadmi&s;&s;ible when we view things in practice) that being compo&s;ed of four or five per|haps, in &s;ome in&s;tances, &s;ix regiments, there might be &s;o many different modes of wor&s;hip. I have mentioned the opinion of the officers and the&s;e hints to Congre&s;s upon this &s;ubject, from a principle of duty, and becau&s;e I am well a&s;&s;ured it is mo&s;t foreign to their wi&s;hes or intention to excite, by any act, the &s;malle&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s and jealou&s;y among the troops.</P>
<P>There remains no room to believe otherwi&s;e than that the enemy are on the point of moving: this is confirmed by intelligence from all quarters, and through &s;o many different channels, that we mu&s;t con&s;ider it certain. Whether they will move by land or water, or by both, cannot be a&s;certain|ed; nor is their de&s;tination preci&s;ely known: but every circum&s;tance points out Philadelphia as their object. Be|ing of this opinion, I have directed the return of general Mifflin. Before he left Philadelphia, I wrote, counter|manding the order for his coming here; but he did not re|ceive my letter. I would al&s;o mention to Congre&s;s that I think the military &s;tores, lately arrived, and at or coming to Philadelphia, &s;hould be removed to a place of perfect &s;e|curity. Though I would not excite needle&s;s unea&s;y ap|prehen&s;ions, prudence requires that things &s;o e&s;&s;ential &s;hould not be expo&s;ed to ri&s;k.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INCLOSED you will receive a copy of a letter from me to lord Cornwallis, on the inhuman treatment of lieu|tenant Martin by a party of the enemy's hor&s;e. My re|mon&s;trance and &s;ending his corp&s;e produced nothing more than a &s;hort an&s;wer from his lord&s;hip, which you al&s;o have. It was thought unnece&s;&s;ary to view the body, the fact being admitted and ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o taken the liberty to inclo&s;e a copy of my letter to general Howe, in an&s;wer to his of the twenty-fir&s;t of April, twenty-&s;econd of May, and fifth in&s;tant. From the latter part of the fir&s;t paragraph in that of the twenty-&s;econd
<PB N="89" REF="029737_0427_0FE29A13F358BEB0">
of May, I was induced to propo&s;e an exchange of all the pri&s;oners now in his hands, &s;o far as it can be effected on the principles of the agreement &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between us, ex|cept that of lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the He&s;&s;ian field-officers who are to be retained till general Lee is de|clared exchangeable. I did not expect the propo&s;ition would be acceded to: but, as his letter is of doubtful meaning in this in&s;tance, I thought it expedient to make the offer,&mdash;fir&s;t, as it will be a happy event if we relea&s;e our pri&s;oners,&mdash;and &s;econdly, as the propo&s;ition may draw from him an explanation of his &s;entiments, though he &s;hould re|ject it.</P>
<P>The New-York paper of the ninth in&s;tant I tran&s;mit for your peru&s;al: it contains an extract of a letter from gover|nor Tryon to Chri&s;topher Billop of Long-I&s;land. This extract, I think, is worthy of attention, and may be im|proved to great advantage if publi&s;hed in the papers with &s;uch &s;trictures and ob&s;ervations as it will well warrant, and as will occur to an ingenious pen. The enemy, on their part, u&s;e the mo&s;t artful publications, and avail them&s;elves of every thing they can, going from us. We &s;hould prof|it, where we can, by their productions.</P>
<P>I would mention to Congre&s;s that &s;everal officers in the corps of cavalry have applied to me, to know in what point of view their hor&s;es are con&s;idered&mdash;whether as pub|lic property, or as private belonging to them&s;elves, to be fur|ni&s;hed at their own expen&s;e. When colonel Sheldon's regiment was ordered to be rai&s;ed, the officers thought the hor&s;es &s;hould be a matter of public charge: but as it had never been determined, and I was not perfectly &s;atisfied with the cu&s;tom in &s;uch ca&s;es, I did not con&s;ider my&s;elf authori&s;ed to decide upon it. I promi&s;ed to recommend it to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s; and this I have done &s;ince on &s;imilar occa&s;ions. The officers urge, that, as hor&s;|es are e&s;&s;ential to the di&s;charge of their duty, they &s;hould be provided at the public expen&s;e; that they have ri&s;en to &s;uch enormous prices, that, if the contrary is e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, they mu&s;t, from the nature of the &s;ervice, not only &s;ink their pay, but make a large &s;acrifice of their private intere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="029737_0428_0FE299BB75598C08">
Though the practice may have been again&s;t their appli|cation in other armies, yet their rea&s;oning &s;eems plau&s;ible and to be founded in ju&s;tice. There are objections too again&s;t the mea&s;ure, but not of &s;ufficient validity, in my opinion, to oppo&s;e to their claim. Another rea&s;on may be &s;ugge&s;ted, why the public &s;hould find them hor&s;es; which is, that if they were to provide them them&s;elves, the apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing them might prevent a proper di&s;charge of duty, and in &s;ome ca&s;es produce too great a degree of cautious prudence.</P>
<P>This matter I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to lay before Congre&s;s, not doubting but it will have that attention which it may &s;eem to de&s;erve. There is one thing more I would add upon the &s;ubject, which is, if their application is con&s;idered ju&s;t, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it be&s;t to fix a certain determinate &s;um to be allowed for the hor&s;es they have brought and may have occa&s;ion to purcha&s;e, in preference to leaving it to their di&s;cretion and judgment.</P>
<P>It being evident, &s;o far as we can rea&s;on from circum|&s;tances and appearances, that general Howe de&s;igns Phil|adelphia to be the fir&s;t object of his pur&s;uits, or the defeat of this army; and, for one or both of the&s;e purpo&s;es, is collecting nearly his whole force at Brun&s;wic,&mdash;a board of general officers determined ye&s;terday evening after ma|ture deliberation, that all the continental troops at Peek&s;|kill and its dependencies, except one thou&s;and effectives, &s;hould be immediately marched to reinforce this army. That number, with the convale&s;cents and &s;uch aids of mi|litia as are now and may be a&s;&s;embled in ca&s;e of emergen|cy, was deemed competent to the defence of tho&s;e po&s;ts again&s;t any attempt that may be made to po&s;&s;e&s;s them in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of things.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a general return &s;hewing our whole &s;trength in Jer&s;ey at this time, from which it will appear our circum&s;tances in this re&s;pect are by no means &s;o de|&s;irable as could be wi&s;hed. I e&s;teem it my duty to tran&s;|mit information of this &s;ort from time to time to Congre&s;s, and am encouraged the more to do it from a conviction that they, &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of the mo&s;t profound &s;ecrecy, will not &s;uffer the lea&s;t intimation of our numbers to tran&s;pire.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="029737_0429_0FE29A1F5860EBC8">
<HI>June</HI> 14.&mdash;Your favour of the thirteenth, with its in|clo&s;ures, was received la&s;t night.</P>
<P>Having propo&s;ed to general Howe an exchange of the pri&s;oners now in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as you will perceive by the inclo&s;ed copy of my letter, and al&s;o added, that <HI>"his con|duct towards pri&s;oners would govern mine,"</HI> it appears to me that it would be improper to tran&s;mit him a copy of your fir&s;t re&s;olution of the tenth in&s;tant, till we have &s;ome|thing more from him on the &s;ubject propo&s;ed. I confe&s;s I did not, nor do I yet, under&s;tand the paragraph of his let|ter of the twenty-&s;econd ultimo, to which I have alluded, and which induced me to propo&s;e an exchange if that was his wi&s;h, and to &s;ubjoin, that his conduct to our pri&s;oners &s;hould govern mine,&mdash;as a caution to prevent him exerci&s;|ing &s;everity or a new mode of treatment of them, contrary to the &s;pirit of the agreement between us, and the ideas entertained upon the &s;ubject when it was fir&s;t entered in|to,&mdash;if &s;uch was his meaning.</P>
<P>Finding that there would be great difficulty in filling the battalions intended to be rai&s;ed, I did not commi&s;&s;ion officers for all the &s;ixteen additional ones: I apprehended &s;uch a mea&s;ure would accumulate expen&s;e without increa&s;|ing our &s;trength, and therefore did not &s;et the whole on foot. I &s;hall be happy, on governor Ca&s;well's letter and your recommendation of colonel Shepard, that he &s;hould have a regiment: from the character given him, and the terms on which he offers his &s;ervices, there can be no ob|jection. Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to appoint him to the command they wi&s;h him to have; and I &s;hould think it advi&s;eable that he be ordered to march with his corps to join this army, leaving proper officers to recruit the de|ficiency.</P>
<P>I have peru&s;ed mon&s;ieur De Coudray's opinion about the fortifications, and have no doubt but that it is well founded. I have not &s;ufficient knowledge of them to pro|nounce an opinion with certainty my&s;elf.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve by the New-York paper the execution of * * *. His family well de&s;erves the generous notice of Congre&s;s. He conducted him&s;elf with great fidelity to our cau&s;e, rendering <HI>[his country e&s;&s;ential]</HI> &s;ervices, and has fallen a &s;acrifice in promoting her intere&s;t. Perhaps
<PB N="92" REF="029737_0430_0FE299C5B2EF8918">
a public act of genero&s;ity (con&s;idering the character he was in) might not be &s;o eligible as a private donation.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 15.&mdash;When I wrote ye&s;terday, my information was that one divi&s;ion of the enemy was advancing on the Princeton road, and it was believed from the general movement of their army that they were proceeding towards Delaware. What their real de&s;ign was, is not yet under|&s;tood. Tho&s;e that advanced on that road, after marching &s;ome di&s;tance, filed off to the right, down Mill&s;tone-river, and joined the other column on the Coryel-ferry road leading by Somer&s;et court-hou&s;e. One object of their movement might be to inclo&s;e general Sullivan and his divi&s;ion between their two columns: another (which mo&s;t probably was the principal cau&s;e, if they did not mean to proceed to Delaware when they &s;et out) to manoeuvre us out of our pre&s;ent encampment into action upon di&s;advan|tageous terms. The fir&s;t they could not hope to &s;ucceed in after general Sullivan changed his po&s;t to Rocky-Hill; an event which took place only the evening before, and which it is pre&s;umed they were not well advi&s;ed of when they left Brun&s;wic. A con&s;iderable body of them remain at Somer&s;et court-hou&s;e, and on the communication be|tween that and Brun&s;wic. We have been and are harra&s;|&s;ing them with light troops: but they being in open ground with a large train of artillery, we cannot do it &s;o effectually as could be wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be glad to be informed whether general De Haas con&s;iders him&s;elf an officer in the army. He has never joined it &s;ince his promotion, or written a &s;ingle line to me upon the &s;ubject. If he accepts his commi&s;&s;ion, it will be well for Congre&s;s to order him to repair to the army immediately. The brigade intended for him is without a general officer, and has brought on a di&s;agreea|ble di&s;pute between two of the colonels, each claiming the command. This is not the only inconvenience:&mdash;officers of high rank remaining at home, afford a bad example to others who are inferior, and grounds of application for the like indulgence.</P>
<P>This letter, except the paragraphs of this date, I in|tended to &s;end ye&s;terday, but was prevented by the move|ment of the enemy which rendered it unadvi&s;eable.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you la&s;t, I informed you that the main body of the enemy had march|ed from Brun&s;wic, and extended their van as far as Som|er&s;et court-hou&s;e. I am now to acquaint you, that, after encamping between the&s;e two po&s;ts and beginning a line of redoubts, they changed their ground ye&s;terday morning and in the cour&s;e of the preceding night, and returned to Brun&s;|wic again, burning, as they went, &s;everal valuable dwelling hou&s;es. We had con&s;tantly light troops hovering round them as far as circum&s;tances would permit: but, being &s;e|cured on their flanks by the Rariton and Mill&s;tone, they were difficult to approach; and, without lo&s;s, effected their return to their former po&s;ts. This &s;udden and precipitate change in their operations has afforded matter for much &s;pec|ulation. We &s;uppo&s;e their original de&s;ign was to attempt an impre&s;&s;ion on our right, or to manoeuvre us out of our ground, or to advance towards the Delaware. Whether the&s;e con|jectures were well founded, cannot be a&s;certained: but it is probable, if they had an impre&s;&s;ion in view, they found

it could not be attempted without great lo&s;s&mdash;(as to bring|ing on an attack, they effectually &s;ecured them&s;elves again&s;t one by the po&s;t they took)&mdash;or if pa&s;&s;ing the Delaware was their object, that, from the temper of the people, the pro&s;ecution of it (if not impracticable) would meet with much greater oppo&s;ition than what they expected: for I mu&s;t ob&s;erve&mdash;and with peculiar &s;atisfaction I do it&mdash;that, on the fir&s;t notice of the enemy's movements, the militia a&s;&s;embled in the mo&s;t &s;pirited manner, firmly determined to give them every annoyance in their power, and to afford us every po&s;&s;ible aid. This I thought it my duty to men|tion in ju&s;tice to their conduct; and I am inclined to be|lieve that general Howe's return, thus &s;uddenly made, mu&s;t have been in con&s;equence of the information he received that the people were in and flying to arms in every quarter to oppo&s;e him. I &s;hall not rea&s;on upon this event: but I cannot but con&s;ider it as a mo&s;t fortunate and happy one to us, and the mo&s;t di&s;tressing Mr. Howe has yet experi|enced, unle&s;s he has &s;chemes in contemplation beyond the reach of my conjecture.</P>

<P>Inclo&s;ed you will be plea&s;ed to receive an extract of a letter from colonel Jack&s;on of Bo&s;ton to general Knox.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour and plea&s;ure to inform you that the enemy evacuated Brun&s;wic this morning and retired to Amboy, burning many hou&s;es as they went along.
<PB N="96" REF="029737_0434_0FE299C8BB3AC010">
Some of them, from the appearance of the flames, were con&s;iderable buildings.</P>
<P>From &s;everal pieces of information and from a variety of circum&s;tances, it was evident that a movement was in agi|tation, and it was the general opinion that it was intended this morning. I therefore detached three brigades under the command of major-general Greene to fall upon their rear, and kept the main body of the army paraded upon the heights, to &s;upport them if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion. A party of colonel Morgan's regiment of light-infantry at|tacked and drove the He&s;&s;ian piquet about &s;un-ri&s;e: and upon the appearance of general Wayne's brigade and Mor|gan's regiment (who got fir&s;t to the ground) oppo&s;ite Brun&s;|wic, the enemy immediately cro&s;&s;ed the bridge to the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, and threw them&s;elves into redoubts which they had before con&s;tructed. Our troops advanced bri&s;kly upon them; upon which they quitted the redoubts without making any oppo&s;ition, and retired by the Amboy road.</P>
<P>As all our troops, from the difference of their &s;tations in camp, had not come up when the enemy began to mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e off, it was impo&s;&s;ible to check them, as their numbers were far greater than we had any rea&s;on to expect,&mdash;being, as we were informed afterwards, between four and five thou|&s;and men. Our men pur&s;ued them as far as Pi&s;catawa: but finding it impo&s;&s;ible to overtake them, and fearing they might be led on too far from the main body, they returned to Brun&s;wic.</P>
<P>By information of the inhabitants, general Howe, lord Cornwallis, and general Grant, were in the town when the alarm was fir&s;t given: but they quitted it very &s;oon after.</P>
<P>In the pur&s;uit, colonel Morgan's riflemen exchanged &s;everal &s;harp fires with the enemy, which, it is imagined, did con&s;iderable execution. I am in hopes that they after|wards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell in with general Maxwell, who was detached la&s;t night with a &s;trong party, to lie between Brun&s;wic and Amboy to intercept any convoys or parties that might be pa&s;&s;ing: but I have yet heard nothing from him.</P>
<P>General Greene de&s;ires me to make mention of the con|duct and bravery of general Wayne and colonel Morgan, and of their officers and men, upon this occa&s;ion, as they con&s;tantly advanced upon an enemy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ar &s;uperior to them i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> numbers, and well &s;ecured behind &s;trong redoubts.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="029737_0435_0FE29A242AEBF210">
General Sullivan advanced from Rocky-Hill to Brun&s;|wic with his divi&s;ion; but, as he did not receive his order of march till very late at night, he did not arrive till the enemy had been gone &s;ome time.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent down lord Stirling's divi&s;ion to reinforce general Maxwell; and in the morning I &s;hall move the main body of the army to &s;ome &s;ecure po&s;t nearer Amboy, from whence we can with more ca&s;e annoy the enemy than from this di&s;tance. I am inclined to think they mean to cro&s;s to Staten-I&s;land: if they do, we may perhaps find an opportunity of making a &s;troke upon their rear: at any rate we &s;hall have a chance of obliging them to make a total evacuation of the State of Jer&s;ey.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the honour to addre&s;s you la&s;t, it was on the &s;ubject of the enemy's retreat from Brun&s;wic to Am|boy, and of the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued to annoy them. At the time of writing, the information I had received re&s;pecting their lo&s;s was rather vague and uncertain: but we have rea|&s;on to believe, from intelligence through various channels &s;ince, that it was pretty con&s;iderable, and fell chiefly on the grenadiers and light-infantry, who formed their covering party. The inclo&s;ed copy of a letter, containing the in|formation of a per&s;on ju&s;t from New-York, corre&s;ponds with other accounts on this head, and with the declarations of &s;ome de&s;erters. Some of the accounts are, that officers were heard to &s;ay they had not &s;uffered &s;o &s;everely &s;ince the affair at Princeton.</P>
<P>After the evacuation of Brun&s;wic, I determined, with the advice of my general officers, to move the whole army the next morning to this po&s;t, where they would be nearer the enemy, and might act according to circum&s;tances. In this I was prevented by rain, and they only moved ye&s;terday morning. I have advanced lord Stirling's divi&s;ion and &s;ome other troops lower down in the neighbourhood of Metuchin meeting-hou&s;e, and intended to have po&s;ted more there; but found, on reconnoitring the ground, that it was low and
<PB N="98" REF="029737_0436_0FE299CA456C6998">
di&s;advantageous, and &s;till more unfavourable through a &s;car|city of water. The&s;e rea&s;ons, added to that of there not being the &s;malle&s;t pro&s;pect of attacking the enemy in Amboy with a probability of &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;&s;ecured on their flanks by water, and in their front by &s;trong redoubts acro&s;s the Neck&mdash;would not permit me, either in my own opinion or that of my general officers, to keep any greater body of men in that quarter, where they would have been di&s;per&s;ed, and of con&s;equence extremely in&s;ecure.</P>
<P>I have light parties lying clo&s;e on the enemy's lines, to watch their motions, and who will be ready to act in con|junction with lord Stirling's divi&s;ion and &s;uch other troops as it may be necessary to detach; though I think&mdash;and &s;o do the re&s;t of the officers&mdash;that no event is likely to take place that will require more, &s;ince the idea of forcing their lines, or bringing on a general engagement on their own ground, is univer&s;ally held incompatible with our intere&s;t, and that that number is &s;ufficient to avail us of any advan|tages we can expect to ari&s;e from their retreating from Amboy, &s;uppo&s;ing notice of the fact &s;hould be obtained. Their contiguity to the Sound, and the &s;mall di&s;tance acro&s;s it, (having boats prepared to pa&s;s in) will enable them to get off (&s;hould they &s;o incline) again&s;t every prudent and ju&s;tifiable exertion on our part. Whether &s;uch is their de&s;ign, is more than I can po&s;itively determine: but there is every rea&s;on to believe that they have been and are tran&s;|porting their baggage to Staten-I&s;land, and making every preparation to embark on board their tran&s;ports for &s;ome new expedition.</P>
<P>Your favour of the twenty-fourth I ju&s;t now received, and am extremely obliged by your cordial congratulations on the enemy's retreat from Brun&s;wic, and favourable in|terpretation of the event of my conduct. The re&s;olution you did me the honour to tran&s;mit &s;hall have my attention.</P>
<P>It is much to be regretted, that an expre&s;s &s;ent off to general Maxwell on Saturday night, to inform him of gen|eral Greene's movement towards Brun&s;wic that he might conduct him&s;elf accordingly, did not reach him. Wheth|er the expre&s;s went de&s;ignedly to the enemy, or was taken, is not known: but there is rea&s;on to believe he fell into their hands. If general Maxwell had received the order,
<PB N="99" REF="029737_0437_0FE29A2EE87D2C60">
there is no doubt but their whole rear-guard would have been cut off. This the enemy confe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, as we are well informed by per&s;ons in Bonemtown.</P>
<P>By a reconnoitring party ju&s;t returned, it is reported as a matter of doubt whether any of the enemy have removed from Amboy; though it is almo&s;t certain they have tran&s;|ported a great deal of their baggage.</P>

<P>ON Thur&s;day morning general Howe advanced with his whole army in &s;everal columns, from Amboy, as far as We&s;tfield. We are certainly informed that the troops &s;ent to Staten-I&s;land returned the preceding evening, and, it is &s;aid, with an augmentation of marines, &s;o that carrying them there was a feint with intention to deceive us. His de&s;ign in this &s;udden movement was either to bring on a general engagement upon di&s;advantageous terms, con&s;idering mat|ters in any point of view&mdash;or to cut off our light parties, and lord Stirling's divi&s;ion which was &s;ent down to &s;up|port them&mdash;or to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the heights and pa&s;&s;es in the mountains on our left. The two la&s;t &s;eemed to be the fir&s;t objects of his attention, as his march was rapid again&s;t the&s;e parties, and indicated a &s;trong di&s;po&s;ition to gain tho&s;e pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of affairs it was thought ab&s;olutely nec|e&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould move our force from the low grounds, to occupy the heights before them; which was effected. As they advanced, they fell in with &s;ome of our light par|ties and part of lord Stirling's divi&s;ion, with which they had &s;ome pretty &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;hing, with but very little lo&s;s I believe on our &s;ide, except in three field-pieces which un|fortunately fell into the enemy's hands: but, not having obtained returns yet, I cannot determine it with certainty; nor can we a&s;certain what the enemy's lo&s;s was.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had gained the pa&s;&s;es, I detached a body of light troops under brigadier-general Scott, to hang on their flank, and to watch their motions; and ordered Mor|gan's corps of riflemen to join him &s;ince. The enemy re|mained

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not been able to a&s;certain yet with any degree of preci&s;ion the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the enemy in the &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes on Thur&s;day, though we have many rea&s;ons to believe it was much more con&s;iderable than what it was apprehended to be when I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you upon the &s;ubject. The inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from lord Stirling contains the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t par|ticular information that I have received: and the accounts given by &s;undry inhabitants to per&s;ons who have been in the neighbourhood where the &s;kirmi&s;hes were, and where the enemy were encamped, countenance this intelligence.</P>
<P>As to our lo&s;s, as reported by the enemy, I am per&s;uad|ed it is exaggerated beyond all bounds of truth or prob|ability, being a&s;&s;ured by lord Stirling that it was trifling&mdash;and by &s;uch de&s;erters as have come in, that they &s;aw but very few pri&s;oners taken. It would have been certainly known before this, (that is, the number not yet returned) had not &s;ome of the parties, and I believe the mo&s;t which were then out, joined the corps &s;ince detached.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the enemy's de&s;igns or intended move|ments, they are not to be determined. It is certain they got into Amboy ye&s;terday evening: and, from advices this morning from officers &s;ent to South-Amboy to ob&s;erve their motions, there were &s;trong rea&s;ons to conclude they were evacuating the town, as their hor&s;e had gone over to Staten-I&s;land, and as &s;everal boats were al&s;o pa&s;&s;ing with baggage, and others with troops. There were further cir|cum&s;tances favouring this opinion, &s;uch as apparent breach|es in &s;ome of their lines: yet general Sullivan informs me, by a letter ju&s;t new received, that, from all the intelligence
<PB N="101" REF="029737_0439_0FE29A7F607D4A90">
he has been able to obtain to-day, he does not think they have any &s;erious intention of quitting it, and that all their movements are a feint, calculated merely to deceive, and to cover &s;ome plans they have in view.</P>
<P>I have two brigades&mdash;Scott's and Conway's&mdash;now lying at and near Woodbridge, as corps of ob&s;ervation, and to act as circum&s;tances may require. General Sullivan was down in the &s;ame neighbourhood with his divi&s;ion, till this even|ing, when he returned, it appearing to him unnece&s;&s;ary to remain longer, and that the brigades I have mentioned would be &s;ufficient for any event likely to take place.</P>

<P>P. S. <HI>June</HI> 30.&mdash;From intelligence received la&s;t night, the opinion that the enemy are evacuating Amboy &s;eems to be more confirmed.</P>
<P>As the facts in lord Stirling's letter are rather taken up on report than from any certain knowledge of their having happened, I cannot con&s;ider them &s;ufficiently authentic for publication; nor are they tran&s;mitted for that purpo&s;e, though I am well per&s;uaded the enemy's lo&s;s was much more con&s;iderable than it was at fir&s;t imagined to be. It has been reported to me to-day that the enemy took &s;ixty|four pri&s;oners in the whole. Whether they were all of our army, or in part countrymen, I cannot decide; for, having detached at that time a number of light parties, and man, of them having fallen in with the corps ordered out &s;ince, returns could not be made with accuracy. The pri&s;oners taken by us were thirteen, two of whom are light dragoons, the re&s;t infantry.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE inclo&s;ed copies of general St. Clair's letters, tran&s;mitted ye&s;terday afternoon and la&s;t night by general Schuyler, I have thought it my duty to &s;end you. The intelligence they contain is important and intere&s;ting; nor are there circum&s;tances wanting be&s;ides the&s;e, to induce a belief, or at lea&s;t to rai&s;e a &s;trong pre&s;umption, that the enemy have in contemplation a junction of their two armies by way of the Lakes and the North-river. If they have their whole Canada force on the former, it is certainly their object.</P>
<P>On receiving the&s;e accounts, I wrote immediately to general Putnam to embark Nixon's brigade for reinforcing the northern army&mdash;to wait however the arrival or near approach of generals Par&s;ons and Varnum's brigades from this place, who march this morning&mdash;or the coming in of an equal number of militia to &s;upply their place before they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. This I have done by the advice of my general offi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">, and is all that is thought practicable in the pre&s;ent un|certain indeterminate &s;ituation of things. The re&s;t of the army here will be held in readine&s;s to move according to information and circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>As I have ob&s;erved, if we were certain general Burgoyne was approaching Ticonderoga with his whole army, I &s;hould not he&s;itate a moment in concluding that it is in con&s;equence of a preconcerted plan with general Howe, and that the latter is to co-operate with him, by pu&s;hing his whole force up the North-river, and aiming a &s;troke in
<PB N="103" REF="029737_0441_0FE29A88850C9270">
the fir&s;t in&s;tance and immediately again&s;t the Highland pa&s;&s;|es. But as the appearance of the enemy on the Lake may be a feint, calculated to amu&s;e and di&s;tract (though it may &s;eem like a real attack) to draw this army to Peek&s;kill and more to the northward, that general Howe may with more facility turn his arms again&s;t Philadelphia&mdash;it has been de|termined unadvi&s;eable for us to move till we have further proofs of his intentions, and that our conduct mu&s;t be gov|erned by his.</P>
<P>Our &s;ituation is truly delicate and embarra&s;&s;ing. Should we march to Peek&s;kill, leaving general Howe on Staten-I&s;land, there will be nothing to prevent him pa&s;&s;ing to South Amboy, and pu&s;hing from thence to Philadelphia, or in &s;hort by any other route; though the marching &s;uch of his troops from the point oppo&s;ite Amboy as were encamped there, and the &s;ailing of the &s;hips from Prince&s;s-bay ye&s;|terday morning, are circum&s;tances indicating that an em|barkation has or will take place. On the other hand, if the North-river and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Highlands are his objects, our remaining here till his views are certainly known may &s;ubject us to a ri&s;k that we wi&s;h to avoid.</P>
<P>Thus, let us examine matters as we will, difficulties &s;tare us in the face. We &s;hall attempt to con&s;ult, and to do the be&s;t we can. I have written to generals Putnam and George Clinton fully upon the &s;ubject, urging them to put forth every exertion in their power, and in&s;tantly to call in a re&s;pectable body of militia to aid in the defence of tho&s;e important po&s;ts at this critical conjuncture. I tru&s;t they will come out; their &s;ervices in all probability will not be wanted but for a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t earne&s;tly reque&s;t that you will &s;end Mr. Stew|art, the i&s;&s;uing commi&s;&s;ary-general, to camp immediately. There is rea&s;on to apprehend the army will be in great di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion for want of i&s;&s;uing commi&s;&s;aries in three or four days. On Saturday, tho&s;e with Mr. Trum|ball declare they will leave him, without they are put on a different footing from what they now are. I need not mention the con&s;equences that will re&s;ult from &s;uch an event, if there are not others here to &s;upply their places.</P>
<P>There is one thing more I would add, which is, that there is not more than forty thou&s;and dollars in the milita|ry
<PB N="104" REF="029737_0442_0FE1BFC974398D78">
che&s;t, and two months' pay due to all the army, except two or three regiments which have ju&s;t obtained warrants. A hundred and fifty-&s;ix thou&s;and, out of the la&s;t &s;upply &s;ent the payma&s;ter, I was obliged to order to Peek&s;kill for the troops in that quarter, who&s;e demands are great and pre&s;&s;ing al&s;o.

<P>As the enemy will adopt every &s;tratagem and device to deceive and di&s;tract us,&mdash;notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ent ap|pearance in favour of their making an expedition up the North-river, I doubt not but you will have the mo&s;t vigi|lant look-outs kept along Delaware-bay, and proper ex|pre&s;&s;es and &s;ignals for communicating the earlie&s;t intelligence. I think it would be highly expedient that &s;ome &s;en&s;ible judicious men &s;hould be employed in that bu&s;ine&s;s at this time, who would view things as they ought to be, and from who&s;e accounts certain inferences and conclu&s;ions may be drawn, &s;o as to form a proper line for our conduct. The mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences may flow from fal&s;e information at this period: things &s;hould be examined with all po&s;&s;ible certainty. I &s;hall not be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear of &s;everal &s;hips appearing in or off Delaware, though general Howe's de&s;|tination &s;hould be el&s;ewhere.

<P>No change has taken place in the &s;ituation of the enemy upon Staten-I&s;land &s;ince I wrote to you on the fifth: but I have this morning received an account from Elizabeth-Town, which mentions that a per&s;on had ju&s;t come from the I&s;land, who informs that &s;mall craft are con&s;tantly

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THIS morning received a letter of the &s;eventh in|&s;tant from general Schuyler, a copy of which, and of its in|clo&s;ure, I herewith &s;end you. The intelligence which they contain is truly intere&s;ting, &s;uppo&s;ing it ju&s;t: but it differs &s;o widely from what we had rea&s;on to expect from the ac|counts mentioned in general St. Clair's letters to general Schuyler (copies of which you would receive in his letter tran&s;mitted from hence la&s;t night by major Hoops) that I would fain flatter my&s;elf it is not true. I am the more encouraged to hope this, as captain Farmam's letter from Fort-Ann to brigadier Learned &s;eems to be the founda|tion of the whole, and does not authori&s;e the unfavourable and unhappy conclu&s;ions built upon it. I &s;hould rather &s;uppo&s;e, if any accident has befallen us, it mu&s;t have hap|pened to the detachment of men from the Grants, under colonel Warner: for we find from general St. Clair's let|ters, he expected &s;omething from him. The whole ac|count is &s;o confu&s;ed that we cannot e&s;tabli&s;h any certain deduction from it; and I &s;hall be happy if it proves pre|mature and groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>I am told by a gentleman who came to camp ye&s;terday evening, that Nixon's brigade would certainly arrive at Al|bany on Tue&s;day morning, as he &s;aw the ve&s;&s;els, in which it was embarked, &s;tanding up the evening before with a fair wind.</P>
<P>If the event mentioned by general Schuyler &s;hould not have happened, we cannot doubt but general Burgoyne has come up the Lake, determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to carry his point,&mdash;I mean, to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of our po&s;ts in that quarter, and to pu&s;h his arms further. Suppo&s;ing this not to have happened, as our continental levies are &s;o deficient in their number, our &s;ecurity and &s;afety will require that aids from the militia &s;hould be called forth in ca&s;es of
<PB N="107" REF="029737_0445_0FE29A8CE24DEFC8">
emergency: if it has, there is now an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for their turning out to check general Burgoyne's progre&s;s; or the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable con&s;equences may be apprehended. Upon this occa&s;ion I would take the liberty to &s;ugge&s;t to Congre&s;s the propriety of &s;ending an active, &s;pirited of|ficer, to conduct and lead them on. If general Arnold has &s;ettled his affairs, and can be &s;pared from Philadelphia, I would recommend him for this bu&s;ine&s;s, and that he &s;hould immediately &s;et out for the northern department: he is active, judicious, and brave, and an officer in whom the militia will repo&s;e great confidence. Be&s;ides this, he is well acquainted with that country, and with the routes and mo&s;t important pa&s;&s;es and defiles in it. I do not think he can render more &s;ignal &s;ervices, or be more u&s;e|fully employed at this time, than in this way. I am per|&s;uaded his pre&s;ence and activity will animate the militia greatly, and &s;pur them on to a becoming conduct. I could wi&s;h him to be engaged in a more agreeable &s;ervice&mdash;to be with better troops: but circum&s;tances call for his exer|tions in this way, and I have no doubt of his adding much to the honours he has already acquired.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the advices from general St. Clair, and the &s;trong probability there is that general Howe will pu&s;h again&s;t the Highland pa&s;&s;es to co-operate with general Burgoyne, I &s;hall, by the advice of my officers, move the army from hence to-morrow morning towards the North|river. If &s;uch &s;hould be his intention, we &s;hall not be too early, as a favourable wind and tide will carry him up in a few hours. On the other hand, if Philadelphia is his ob|ject, he cannot get round before we can arrive there; nor can he well debark his troops, &amp;c. and proceed acro&s;s the land, before we can oppo&s;e him.</P>

<P>WHEN I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you la&s;t. I hoped the intelligence received re&s;pecting our affairs in the northern department was not true, or at lea&s;t that they were not &s;o unfavourable as they were then repre&s;ented.
<PB N="108" REF="029737_0446_0FE29A322737C798">
But the inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from general Schuyler, which came to hand ye&s;terday evening, confirms it, mo&s;t unhappily for us, in its fulle&s;t latitude. This event, (the evacuation of our po&s;ts on the Lake) among the mo&s;t un|fortunate that could have befallen us,&mdash;is rendered more intere&s;ting by the manner in which it took place. I have no further information upon the &s;ubject than what the copy contains, and &s;hall be happy to hear by my next advices, that the main body of the army, of who&s;e &s;ituation general Schuyler knew nothing with certainty, have not become pri&s;oners: for I fear, from the di&s;po&s;ition they di&s;covered on this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion, they would have surrendered to the enemy, in ca&s;e they fell in with them, though infe|rior in number.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to general Schuyler's demands, it is not in my power to comply with the whole of them. Not a &s;in|gle tent can be furni&s;hed: the kettles will be, and are or|dered on; and an expre&s;s is going to Springfield for all the mu&s;ket-cartridges, &s;ixty barrels of powder, and a pro|portionable quantity of lead and cartridge-paper for his u&s;e. Ten pieces of artillery, with harne&s;s, are al&s;o ordered, with proper officers from Peek&s;kill. I have written to him to procure hor&s;es and drivers him&s;elf, as they are to be ob|tained with much more ea&s;e where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e is, than here: nor can he be &s;upplied with the heavy cannon which he reque&s;ts, &s;uppo&s;ing them nece&s;&s;ary,&mdash;not having one to &s;pare from a more important u&s;e,&mdash;the defence of the Highlands Colonel Putnam, I imagine, will be with him before this, as his regiment is part of Nixon's brigade,&mdash;who will an|&s;wer every purpo&s;e he can po&s;&s;ibly have for an engineer at this cri&s;is. A &s;upply of intrenching tools was &s;ent him four or five days ago, in con&s;equence of an application then made.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be extremely happy if our &s;ituation would allow me to afford him a large reinforcement of men: but I cannot with any degree of propriety, in the opinion of my general officers, &s;end more to his aid at this time than a number of recruits on the march from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts State, belonging to &s;ome of the regiments under his command, who amount to &s;ix hundred at lea&s;t, and are now, I ex|pect, pretty well advanced towards Peek&s;kill. With this
<PB N="109" REF="029737_0447_0FE29A8E6671EB40">
augmentation to what he already has,&mdash;&s;uppo&s;ing general St. Clair and his force to have come in, and any number of militia to have turned out,&mdash;he will have an army, equal if not &s;uperior to general Burgoyne's, from the only accounts we have obtained. Be&s;ides this con&s;ideration, it is mo&s;t probable that general Burgoyne will &s;u&s;pend his operations till general Howe makes a movement and an effort on his part. His de&s;igns, I think, are mo&s;t unque&s;tionably again&s;t the Highlands, and that he will attempt the execution as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>We have been prevented marching to-day by the rain; but, as &s;oon as the weather permits, &s;hall proceed as expe|ditiou&s;ly as we can towards the North-river, and cro&s;s, or not, as &s;hall appear nece&s;&s;ary from circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t I took the liberty of &s;ugge&s;ting the propriety of &s;ending an active officer to animate the militia that may a&s;&s;emble for checking general Burgoyne's progre&s;s, and mentioned general Arnold for that purpo&s;e. Being more and more convinced of the important advantages that will re&s;ult from his pre&s;ence and conduct, I have thought it my duty to repeat my wi&s;hes on the &s;ubject, and that he may, without a moment's lo&s;s of time, &s;et out from Philadelphia for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>When this arrives, it is likely general Howe's intention will be well under&s;tood: but whether it is or not, as there are &s;trong rea&s;ons to believe his operations will be up the North-river and on the ea&s;t &s;ide of it, I &s;hall take the lib|erty to recommend the &s;ending on the North-Carolina and other continental troops at Philadelphia, to join this army, unle&s;s Congre&s;s have &s;ome information that a &s;outhern ex|pedition is intended, of which I am not appri&s;ed.</P>
<P>If Congre&s;s have taken colonel Procter and his corps into the &s;ervice of the States, it will be expedient for them to come on with all the field-artillery which colonel Flow|ers the commi&s;&s;ary may have ready. This I have been induced to mention, having heard Congre&s;s were about to adopt them, and as our demand for artilleri&s;ts is great. I would al&s;o ob&s;erve that the &s;ituation of our affairs has be|come &s;o delicate and embarra&s;&s;ing by the late misfortune we have experienced, that it is much to be wi&s;hed &s;ome expedient could be come into, if there be any more effica|cious

<P>Your letter of the eighth was duly received; and, agree|able to your reque&s;t. I communicated to generals Greene and Knox the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s re&s;pecting them and general Sullivan, the la&s;t of whom I have not &s;een &s;ince it came to hand.</P>

<P>I WAS ye&s;terday evening honoured with yours of the fourteenth. I have heard nothing from the northward &s;ince my la&s;t.

Till I have more certain information of the &s;tate of our affairs to the northward, and of general Howe's real intentions, I have concluded to halt the army at this place, from whence. I can either march forward or return, as circum&s;tances may require.</P>
<P>If general Na&s;h &s;hould not have begun his march before this reaches you, be plea&s;ed to order him to proceed as far as Trenton only, and there wait my further orders. In ca&s;e he &s;hould have marched, be plea&s;ed to di&s;patch an ex|pre&s;s after him, with orders to halt at Trenten.</P>
<P>I am plea&s;ed to hear that you have taken colonel Proc|ter's corps of artillery into continental &s;ervice. You will be kind enough to order them to join the army immediate|ly: for I expect the light artillery in a few days from the ea&s;tward; and artillery-men will be wanted to man them.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but the militia from the we&s;tern parts of New-England will turn out to general Schuyler's a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, as I hope tho&s;e of this State and Jer&s;ey will to mine, &s;hould they be wanted.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be very happy if the committee of Congre&s;s can arrange the commi&s;&s;ary's department in &s;uch a manner as will &s;atisfy the officers concerned in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and at the &s;ame time &s;erve to &s;upply the army with more regularity than has been done for &s;ome time pa&s;t.

<P>With re&s;pect to food, con&s;idering we are in &s;uch an ex|ten&s;ive and abundant country, no army was ever wor&s;e &s;up|plied than ours, with many e&s;&s;ential articles of it. Our &s;oldiers, the greate&s;t part of la&s;t campaign and the whole of this, have &s;carcely ta&s;ted any kind of vegetables,&mdash;had but little &s;alt;&mdash;and vinegar, which would have been a tol|erable &s;ub&s;titute for vegetables, they have been in a great mea&s;ure &s;trangers to. Neither have they been provided with proper drink: beer or cider &s;eldom comes within the verge of the camp, and ruin in much too &s;mall quanti|ties. Thus, to devouring large quantities of animal food untempered by vegetables or vinegar, or by any kind of drink but water,&mdash;and eating indifferent bread, (but for this la&s;t a remedy is provided)&mdash;are to be a&s;cribed the many putrid di&s;ea&s;es incident to the army, and the lament|able mortality that attended us la&s;t campaign. If the&s;e evils can be remedied, the expen&s;e and trouble ought not to be ob&s;tacles. Though &s;ome kinds of vegetables are not to be had, others are, which, together with &s;our krout and vinegar, might ea&s;ily be had, if proper per&s;ons ac|quainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s were employed therein.</P>
<P>Soap is another article in great demand. The conti|nental allowance is too &s;mall: and, dear as every nece&s;|&s;ary of life is now got, a &s;oldier's pay will not enable him to purcha&s;e; by which means his con&s;equent dirtine&s;s adds not a little to the di&s;ea&s;es of the army.</P>

I have no rea&s;on to accu&s;e the clothier-general of inat|tention to his department; and therefore, as his &s;upplies are incompetent to the wants of the army, I am to &s;up|po&s;e his re&s;ources are unequal. Ought not each State then to be called upon to draw &s;uch &s;upplies from the country manufactories, as can be afforded? particularly of &s;hoes, &s;tockings, &s;hirts and blankets,&mdash;articles indi&s;pen&s;ably nec|e&s;&s;ary, and of which &s;carce too many can be provided:&mdash;in the mean while, every provi&s;ion to be making, for cloth|ing the troops uniformly and warm in the winter. It is a maxim which needs no illu&s;tration, that nothing can be of more importance in an army, than the clothing and feeding it well. On the&s;e the health, comfort and &s;pirits of the &s;oldiers e&s;&s;entially depend; and it is a melancholy fact, that the American army are mi&s;erably defective in both the&s;e re&s;pects. The di&s;tre&s;s mo&s;t of them are in for want of cloathing is painful to humanity, di&s;piriting to them|&s;elves, and di&s;couraging to every officer. It makes every preten&s;ion to the pre&s;ervation of cleanline&s;s impo&s;&s;ible, expo&s;es them to a variety of di&s;orders, and abates or de|&s;troys that military pride, without which nothing can be expected from any army.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence of giving rank indi&s;criminately is much to be dreaded: great di&s;&s;atisfaction has already ari&s;en on account of be&s;towing this on officers in the civil departments of the army, on the inferior &s;taff, waggon-ma&s;ter, &amp;c. who, by cu&s;tom, propriety, and every other motive, are excluded from it in all well-regulated armies. The too great liber|ality practi&s;ed in this re&s;pect will de&s;troy the pride of rank where it ought to exi&s;t, and will not only render it cheap, but contemptible. It is the policy of all armies to make it valued and re&s;pected, as a &s;timulus to emulation, and an incitement to bold and gallant undertakings: it mu&s;t be very unadvi&s;eable therefore, in our infant &s;tate of war, to adopt novel cu&s;toms to bring it into di&s;credit&mdash;which mu&s;t and will be the con&s;equence of making it too common, be|&s;ides the di&s;gu&s;t it creates in others.</P>
<P>An auditor of accounts, to be con&s;tantly with the army, is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite. It is impo&s;&s;ible for me, crowded as I am with other bu&s;ine&s;s, to examine and adju&s;t the numerous complex accounts of the army with-that correctne&s;s the
<PB N="116" REF="029737_0454_0FE29A417AB4AFC0">
public have a right to expect, before warrants pa&s;s for pay|ment; and, without doing it, great impo&s;itions may follow. The provi&s;ion for making regimental pay-ma&s;ters regulate all regimental accounts is altogether incompetent to the end propo&s;ed from it: for the&s;e men being appointed generally agreeable to the recommendation of the field-officers of the regiments they belong to&mdash;a&s;&s;ociating con&s;tantly with the officers of their corps, and in a great mea&s;ure under their control&mdash;cannot be con&s;idered as &s;ufficiently uninfluenced: nor are auditors at a di&s;tance from the army of much u&s;e, as it would require a delay not admi&s;&s;ible, to &s;end accounts to them to audit before they were pa&s;&s;ed and paid in con&s;e|&s;equence of warrants from the commander-in-chief of the army.</P>
<P>A good geographer, to &s;urvey the roads and take &s;ketch|es of the country where the army is to act, would be ex|tremely u&s;eful, and might be attended with exceeding valuable con&s;equences. He might with propriety have the chief direction of the guides, and mu&s;t have a head to pro|cure, govern, and pay them. If &s;uch a per&s;on &s;hould be approved of, I would beg leave to recommend Mr. Robert Er&s;kine, who is thoroughly &s;killed in this bu&s;ine&s;s, has al|ready a&s;&s;i&s;ted us in making maps of the country, and has (as I am informed) uniformly &s;upported the character of a fa&s;t friend to America.</P>
<P>A &s;mall travelling pre&s;s, to follow head-quarters, would be productive of many eminent advantages. It would enable us to give &s;peedy and exact information of any mil|itary tran&s;actions that take place, with proper comments upon them, and thereby fru&s;trate the pernicious tendency of fal&s;ehood and mi&s;repre&s;entation, which in my opinion, of whatever complexion they may be, are, in the main, detrimental to our cau&s;e. If the people had a channel of intelligence, that, from its u&s;ual authenticity, they could look up to with confidence, they might often be pre&s;erved from that de&s;pondency which they are apt to fall into from the exaggerated pictures our enemies and their emi&s;&s;aries among us commonly draw of any misfortunes we meet with,&mdash;and from that diffidence of truths favourable to us, which they mu&s;t naturally feel from the frequent deception they are expo&s;ed to by the extravagant colourings our
<PB N="117" REF="029737_0455_0FE29A9E09D68A18">
friends often give to our &s;ucce&s;&s;es. It would al&s;o be very u&s;eful to di&s;patch bu&s;ine&s;s in camp, being the mo&s;t expedi|tious means of taking copies of orders or other matters that require to be di&s;per&s;ed, and would &s;ave a good deal in returns and other papers we are often obliged to get printed in Philadelphia. An ingenious man, to accompa|ny this pre&s;s and be employed wholly in writing for it, might render it &s;ingularly beneficial.</P>
<P>I am exceedingly embarra&s;&s;ed how to di&s;po&s;e of the French officers in general, but more e&s;pecially the artillery officers, who are come out under the &s;anction of a compact. I can think of no other way than that of forming a &s;eparate corps of them, and draughting men from the whole line to compo&s;e that corps: but even this will be attended with many di&s;agreeable effects;&mdash;among others this is not the lea&s;t, that officers will think them&s;elves much injured to have the men they have had the trouble of rai&s;ing, taken from them and given to others. There is &s;omething in this which is di&s;couraging, and breaks the &s;pirit of a good officer, who prides him&s;elf in having a full and complete corps.</P>
<P>A doubt has ari&s;en, whether a per&s;on who belongs to any of the United States of America, and who owed al|legiance to any of the &s;aid States,&mdash;that went to the ene|my &s;ome time pa&s;t, and &s;ince that time has been lurking about any of the fortifications, or about any of the encamp|ments of the armies of the United States,&mdash;plundering and driving off cattle to the enemy, recruiting for them, or committing any other atrocious crime,&mdash;or who is appoint|ed an officer in the enemy's army,&mdash;can be tried by a general court-martial, under the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s of the twenty-fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1776, and puni&s;hed as a &s;py.</P>

<PB N="118" REF="029737_0456_0FE29A445A93AE30">
out to &s;ea. By authentic information, there are only forty &s;hips at New-York; the re&s;t are gone el&s;ewhere, and have fallen down between the Narrows and the Hook: between the&s;e two places, the number, from the mo&s;t accurate ob|&s;ervation, was about one hundred and twenty ye&s;terday. As I ob&s;erved before, their de&s;tination is uncertain and un|known: but I have thought it my duty to inform Congre&s;s of the&s;e facts, that they may give orders to the militia to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to march on the &s;horte&s;t notice, in ca&s;e Philadelphia &s;hould be their object. At the &s;ame time I am to reque&s;t that they will have a &s;ufficient number of proper look-outs fixed at the Capes of Delaware, (to who&s;e accounts implicit confidence may be given) to make the earlie&s;t reports of the arrival of any &s;leet,&mdash;which Con|gre&s;s will tran&s;mit me by the &s;peedie&s;t conveyance.</P>
<P>As the enemy will probably make many feints, and have it unhappily but too much in their power from their &s;hip|ping, I would advi&s;e that the look-outs &s;hould be cautioned to be extremely accurate in their ob&s;ervations and reports, mentioning, with as much preci&s;ion as po&s;&s;ible, the number of &s;hips that may appear. Our &s;ituation is already criti|cal, and may be rendered &s;till more &s;o by inaccurate and ill-grounded intelligence.</P>

an exchange between generals Lee and Pre&s;cot. I di&s;patched it early the next morning, and pre&s;ume it got to hand on the eighteenth. As yet I have not received his an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The amazing advantage the enemy derive from their &s;hips and the command of the water, keeps us in a &s;tate of con&s;tant perplexity and the mo&s;t anxious conjecture. We are not yet informed of their de&s;tination, nor can any plau|&s;ible conclu&s;ions be drawn re&s;pecting it, at lea&s;t not &s;uch as appear &s;atisfactory. What renders the matter &s;till more difficult and confu&s;ed, is their extreme inactivity and delay: for it is certain they began to embark immediately after the evacuation of Amboy, and now remain between the Narrows and the Hook, or were there when I was la&s;t ad|vi&s;ed upon the &s;ubject. I have two active officers, with an e&s;cort, now out, for the purpo&s;e of intelligence, and for re|connoit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing their &s;ituation from Fort-Lee and along the river in that neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Things being thus circum&s;tanced, and various opinions, as to their real object, prevailing among us,&mdash;&s;ome &s;uppo&s;|ing it to be Philadelphia, others the North-river, and others an expedition more ea&s;terly,&mdash;I would &s;ubmit it to Con|gre&s;s whether the militia of the neighbouring counties &s;hould not be immediately called to the fir&s;t, or at Che&s;ter,&mdash;the lower counties, at Wilmington. This mea&s;ure appears to me highly expedient, and no objection can lie again&s;t it, of &s;ufficient validity to prevent it, as a few days mu&s;t certainly determine their real de&s;igns. Should they be again&s;t Phil|adelphia, and they have favourable winds, their voyage will be made in a &s;hort time, when it may be too late to obtain their aid, and to arrange them properly for defence, &s;uppo&s;ing them to come in. I am the more induced to recommend this mea&s;ure, as the &s;everal objects we have to attend to necessa|rily oblige this army to continue at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from that place till their intentio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s are better under&s;tood; and as they might by a &s;udden and rapid p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">h attempt to ef|fect &s;ome material, capital &s;troke, before we could get there, unle&s;s there is a re&s;pectable force to oppo&s;e them: for, though no great dependence can be put in a militia acting alone, nor a vigorous oppo&s;ition expected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them (from the nature of things) to a di&s;ciplined, well appointed army,

yet their operations may be greatly retarded by them, and may be checked till other &s;uccours arrive. The report of a force, e&s;pecially if it is in any wi&s;e re&s;pectable, let it be of what &s;ort it may, will have &s;ome influence on their conduct, and may prevent enterpri&s;es that would otherwi&s;e be undertaken.</P>
<P>From the intelligence we received on Saturday evening that a number of the enemy's &s;hips were &s;tanding up the North-river,&mdash;and in the cour&s;e of that and the preceding day, that forty &s;ail were in the Sound, going into Fairfield harbour,&mdash;I had not the lea&s;t doubt in my mind but gen|eral Howe had in view a &s;troke again&s;t the Highlands and the fortifications there, and to co-operate with general Burgoyne. In con&s;equence of the&s;e advices, I judged it expedient to move the army the next morning, from our then encampment, towards tho&s;e po&s;ts. Lord Stirling's divi&s;ion was ordered to take the route to King's-ferry, and to pa&s;s the river to Peek&s;kill; and I proceeded my&s;elf with the remainder, which compo&s;ed the main body, by the route leading through the Clove towards New-Wind&s;or. We marched over a very difficult and rugged road till night, when we halted,&mdash;the fir&s;t divi&s;ion having advanced about eighteen miles. In this &s;ituation we lay till ye&s;terday morning, when, from the information received before re|&s;pecting the enemy's fleet being at and near the Hook, and no further accounts of the &s;hips in the Sound, a change in our mea&s;ures took place. Stephen and Lincoln's divi&s;ions were ordered to proceed to Che&s;ter, (there to wait fur|ther directions, as a place from whence they may move with much more ea&s;e either to Philadelphia or Hud&s;on's river, being &s;even miles nearer the former, and equally con|venient to the latter) and general Greene's divi&s;ion to this ground. By dividing, and this arrangement, I am in hopes our movements will be more expeditious, where&s;oev|er they may be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your letter of ye&s;terday, and with its inclo&s;ures.

In the cour&s;e of their deliberation they took into con&s;ideration the &s;ubject reported&mdash;I &s;hall only add that this matter has been long complained of by the officers, and the more &s;o as the indulgence they pray could not nor can be ever attended with the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible injury to the public, and is what I believe is allowed in mo&s;t armies.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE di&s;appearance of the enemy's fleet for &s;o many days rendering it rather improbable that they will again re|turn, I have thought it advi&s;eable to remove the army back to Coryel's, where it will be near enough to &s;uccour Phila|delphia, &s;hould the enemy, contrary to appearances, &s;till make that the object of their next operation; and will be &s;o much the more conveniently &s;ituated to proceed to the northward, &s;hould the event of the pre&s;ent ambiguous and perplexing &s;ituation of things call them that way. I was the more inclined to this &s;tep, as the nearne&s;s of the army to the city, be&s;ides other di&s;advantages, afforded a temp|tation both to officers and men, to indulge them&s;elves in licen&s;es incon&s;i&s;tent with di&s;cipline and order, and con&s;e|quently of an injurious tendency.</P>
<P>But before my departure, I e&s;teem it my duty to commu|nicate to Congre&s;s the re&s;ult of my examination into the nature of the river-defence proper to be adopted, according to the means in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to prevent the &s;ucce&s;s of any attempt upon Philadelphia by water. I therefore beg leave to lay before Congre&s;s what appears to me mo&s;t eligible, con&s;idering all circum&s;tances, and comparing my own ob&s;ervations with the different opinions of the gentlemen whom I con&s;ulted on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is generally a well-founded maxim, that we ought to endeavour to reduce our defence as much as po&s;&s;ible to a certainty by collecting our &s;trength and making all our prep|arations at one point, rather than to ri&s;k its being weak and ineffectual every where, by dividing our attention and force to different objects:&mdash;in doing this, we may di&s;able our&s;elves from acting with &s;ufficient vigour any where, and a misfortune in one place may pave the way for a &s;imilar
<PB N="128" REF="029737_0466_0FE29A5C544D53A0">
one in another. In our circum&s;tances we have neither men, cannon, nor any thing el&s;e to &s;pare, and perhaps can|not with propriety hazard them on objects, which, being attended with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s we can promi&s;e our&s;elves, can be productive of only partial and indeci&s;ive advantages, and which may po&s;&s;ibly fail of the end propo&s;ed,&mdash;may have &s;ome &s;erious ill con&s;equences,&mdash;and mu&s;t at all events have &s;ome di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>It is then to be con&s;idered where our defence can be mo&s;t effectually made&mdash;whether at Billing&s;port or at Fort-I&s;land. It appears to me that the la&s;t de&s;erves greatly the preference: Billing&s;port has but one row of chevaux-de-fri&s;e: Fort-I&s;land has three, and, in addition to them, a boom, and another chevaux-de-fri&s;e ready to be &s;unk in the channel on the approach of the enemy: of cour&s;e the ob|&s;tructions, in this re&s;pect, are four times as great at the one as at the other. The gallies and floating batteries that could be brought for the defence of the chevaux-de-fri&s;e at Billing&s;port would be unable to maintain their &s;tation when once the enemy were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the commanding ground on the Jer&s;ey &s;ide, to which they would be entirely expo&s;ed; and, notwith&s;tanding the works rai&s;ing there, even &s;uppo&s;ing them complete, the &s;tronge&s;t advocates for making our defence in this place do not pretend that the event can be protracted more than fifteen or twenty days at mo&s;t; at the end of which time, we &s;hould be obliged, with the lo&s;s of our cannon at lea&s;t, to abandon the de|fence, and leave it in the power of the enemy to remove or de&s;troy the chevaux-de-fri&s;e at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Nor is it by any means certain that a &s;ingle row of che|vaux-de-fri&s;e would be an impenetrable barrier to the ene|my's &s;hips:&mdash;experiments have been made, that lead to a contrary &s;uppo&s;ition; and if they &s;hould hazard one (which it might be well worth their while to do with &s;ome of their le&s;s valuable &s;hips) under favour of a leading breeze and tide, and &s;hould &s;ucceed in it,&mdash;the con&s;equence might be the lo&s;s of our gallies and floating batteries, which I appre|hend might be intercepted, and (with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their gallies and &s;mall armed ve&s;&s;els) taken: and this would greatly weaken the oppo&s;ition we might otherwi&s;e give at Fort-I&s;land, and tend powerfully to tender it abortive.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="029737_0467_0FE29ABB4E2B78D0">
But if they &s;hould not attempt this, contenting them&s;elves with &s;afer though &s;lower operations, I have already ob&s;erv|ed that it is agreed on all hands, in fifteen or twenty days they would be able to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of infallible means of fru&s;trating our oppo&s;ition there by the capture of our works. And if we add to this that it might very po&s;|&s;ibly happen in le&s;s time,&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no other cau&s;e, yet, from the garri&s;on being intimidated by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of its own inferiority and inability to &s;upport it&s;elf again&s;t a &s;o much &s;uperior force of numbers, which might occa&s;ion a conduct de&s;tructive to it&s;elf,&mdash;there will remain no &s;ufficient rea&s;ons to ju&s;tify the making this the principal point of defence.</P>
<P>At Fort-I&s;land, the boom and chevaux-de-fri&s;e are an ample &s;ecurity again&s;t any forcible impre&s;&s;ion of the enemy's &s;hips, which it would be imprudent in them to attempt. On the Jer&s;ey &s;ide, the &s;ituation of the ground is &s;uch, that the gallies, floating-batteries, and forts, employed in the defence of the ob&s;tructions, would have little to fear from any batteries erected there. Red-bank &s;eems by its eleva|tion to be the only advantageous &s;pot for annoying them: but as it is computed to be above nineteen hundred yards from Fort-I&s;land, the di&s;tance is rather too great to allow any battery rai&s;ed there to act with &s;uch effect as to be able to &s;ilence our fire. On this &s;ide, the ground, by dikes and &s;luices, may be laid under water to &s;o con&s;iderable an ex|tent as to leave no danger of our river force being annoyed from thence; for which purpo&s;e &s;uitable preparations ought at once to be made, again&s;t it be nece&s;&s;ary to carry them into effect.</P>
<P>But though a battery upon Red-bank would not, in my apprehen&s;ion, be able to prevent the efficacy of our defence, or give any material di&s;turbance to Fort-I&s;land in particu|lar, yet it might &s;erve to make the &s;ituation of &s;ome of our gallies rather unea&s;y; and this perhaps makes it worth while to pre-occupy it in order to keep it out of the enemy's hands, erecting a &s;mall but &s;trong work there, capable of containing about two hundred men, with &s;ix or eight pieces of light cannon and a proportionable quantity of &s;tores. As the approaches to it are difficult on account of the ad|jacent creeks, and a communication can be kept open be|tween it and our army,&mdash;by which means the garri&s;on
<PB N="130" REF="029737_0468_0FE29A5E0CA5D6B8">
might receive &s;uccours from time to time,&mdash;though we could not expect to make it impregnable, yet we &s;hould have a pro&s;pect of holding it much longer than we could the work at Billing&s;port. In the po&s;ition, which, from my pre&s;ent view of it, I &s;hould think it be&s;t for our army to take, the left wing of it would be nearly oppo&s;ite to Red-bank, and therefore in a condition to relieve and &s;upport it;&mdash;whereas Billing&s;port being more remote from the probable po&s;ition of the army, and detached from any other work, could not ea&s;ily derive any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from without, and mu&s;t rely wholly upon its own &s;trength.</P>
<P>Either at Billing&s;port or at Fort-I&s;land, I believe there is not much to be apprehended from the fire of the enemy's &s;hips unaided by land-batteries: for, as by the information of tho&s;e who ought to be acquainted with the fact, not more than three &s;hips can act a-brea&s;t at a time at either place,&mdash;and as the gallies, not requiring the &s;ame depth of water, can extend them&s;elves at plea&s;ure, and be&s;ides carry a &s;uperior weight of metal to that which frigates commonly have,&mdash;a much &s;uperior fire could be oppo&s;ed to them than any they could bring, and (from the difference of &s;ize and make between the frigates and gallies) to much better ef|fect than theirs. The comparative extent of the river at Billing&s;port and at Fort-I&s;land has been a&s;&s;igned as a motive of preference to the former,&mdash;the river being narrower there than at the latter, and &s;uppo&s;ed to admit of fewer &s;hips op|erating at a time: but as it is a&s;&s;erted by the gentlemen in the river department, that the &s;and-banks and &s;hallow|ne&s;s of the river in mo&s;t places near Fort-I&s;land compen|&s;ate for the width of it, and make it impo&s;&s;ible for more than three &s;hips to act together at a time,&mdash;this rea&s;on for preferring the po&s;ition at Billing&s;port &s;eems to have no foundation. And if we con&s;ider that our whole force of gallies and floating batteries would be collected at Fort-I&s;land, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the fort it&s;elf,&mdash;and that it would not be &s;afe to tru&s;t them all out for the defence of Billing&s;port for fear of the di&s;a&s;ter already &s;ugge&s;ted,&mdash;it &s;eems evident enough that this is the place where our defence may be mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully made.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t weighty con&s;iderations with me is that our army, as before intimated, could more conveniently
<PB N="131" REF="029737_0469_0FE29ABCD4E84F68">
co-operate with the defence by water here than at Billing&s;|port. The ground on this &s;ide is better &s;ituated here than at the other place: and the army being &s;o much nearer the city, it is &s;o much the le&s;s likely that the enemy &s;hould be able, by a circuitous route, to fall into the rear of it, and &s;eparate it from the city,&mdash;which is a circum|&s;tance that ought carefully to be attended to.</P>
<P>Some gentlemen are of opinion that our principal de|pendence ought to be upon Fort-I&s;land and its appendages: but, at the &s;ame time, that we &s;hould make a part of our defence at Billing&s;port,&mdash;propo&s;ing, for that purpo&s;e, that the works there &s;hould be continued on the new contracted &s;cale, to be garri&s;oned by four or five hundred men. The rea&s;ons for this are, that it would &s;erve to delay the ene|my, and give our army time to come up, &s;hould it be at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay di&s;tance,&mdash;and that it would prevent tho&s;e di&s;agreea|ble impre&s;&s;ions which never fail to accompany the aban|doning works that have been once rai&s;ed, and plans that have been once in execution, e&s;pecially when the per&s;ons concerned in the defence of them repo&s;e a degree of con|fidence in them,&mdash;which is &s;aid to be the ca&s;e in the pres|ent in&s;tance.</P>
<P>But the&s;e rea&s;ons may perhaps not be &s;o conclu&s;ive as it is imagined: for it is a que&s;tion, whether, if our army was &s;o remote as to make &s;uch a delay nece&s;&s;ary, the enemy would embarra&s;s them&s;elves with removing the wa|ter ob&s;tructions in the fir&s;t place, but would not rather de|bark and make a rapid march by land, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves of the city, and of tho&s;e po&s;itions which would make the &s;urrender of the gallies, &amp;c. in &s;ome &s;ort a nat|ural con&s;equence. And it is worthy of con&s;ideration whether the abandoning the works begun at this time, which will probably allow &s;ome lei&s;ure for any di&s;agree|able impre&s;&s;ions it might make to be effaced, will not be le&s;s injurious than the abandoning them hereafter when they have co&s;t more expen&s;e, time and labour, and in the critical moment of an attack, when every misfortune, and the lo&s;s of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable po&s;t, is too apt to have a much wor&s;e influence on the mind, than the real import|ance of it will ju&s;tify.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="029737_0470_0FE29A5F91943A98">
Add to this the po&s;&s;ibility that the garri&s;on, di&s;mayed at the approach of numbers &s;o &s;uperior to their own, might not an&s;wer the end expected from them, and might even be lo&s;t by their timidity;&mdash;the certainty of lo&s;ing the can|non after the time limited for the defence, and thereby weakening that of the upper po&s;ition;&mdash;the chance of lo&s;|ing the gallies and floating-batteries requi&s;ite for covering the chevaux-de-fri&s;e, by a hazardous and &s;ucce&s;sful attempt to break through them,&mdash;and the garri&s;on with them, which would fall of cour&s;e upon &s;uch an event. It is however &s;ubmitted to Congre&s;s to balance the advantages and di&s;ad|vantages, and determine accordingly. I would only beg leave to give it clearly as my opinion that our principle de|pendence ought to be upon Fort-I&s;land and the ob&s;tructions there, and that Billing&s;port ought not by any means to be defended more than as a &s;econdary object: and, to that end, I would recommend that the works on Fort-I&s;land,&mdash;which, on their pre&s;ent con&s;truction, are by no means calculated for the defence of the chevaux-de-fri&s;e,&mdash;be immediately altered and adapted to that purpo&s;e, tak|ing care at the &s;ame time to make them defen&s;ible with a &s;mall number of men again&s;t any &s;udden attempt to land in boats and carry them by a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>But, whatever &s;cheme is pur&s;ued, I could wi&s;h the greate&s;t diligence and di&s;patch may be u&s;ed in bringing it to maturity: for, though the danger which lately threat|ened &s;eems to have &s;ub&s;ided, there is no knowing how &s;oon it may return: and certainly it will be prudent to do every thing in our power to be prepared for it, as we can lo&s;e nothing by being &s;o, and may lo&s;e a great deal by neglecting to improve the interval of lei&s;ure they have given us, &s;hould it be their intention to revi&s;it this quarter. As the means to this, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to furni&s;h Mr. Coud|ray, to whom the &s;uperintendency of tho&s;e works is entru&s;t|ed, with a competent number of workmen, tools, and what other things he may want, to enable him to carry them on with propriety, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e, and expedition.</P>
<P>On the whole, I am of opinion that the ob&s;tructions in the river, with the help of gallies, floating-batteries, and with tolerable indu&s;try to put the land works in a proper &s;tate, will be extremely formidable to the enemy, and au|thori&s;e
<PB N="133" REF="029737_0471_0FE29ABE581C7858">
a rea&s;onable expectation of their being effectual. The fire-&s;hips al&s;o will contribute to this end: for though there are many ob&s;tacles to render their &s;ucce&s;s precarious, and a happy concurrence of circum&s;tances is nece&s;&s;ary to|wards it,&mdash;any of which failing may di&s;appoint the project, and there is therefore no room to be &s;anguine, yet there is &s;ome probability of its &s;ucceeding; and they will be at lea&s;t an embarra&s;&s;ment and terror to the enemy, and will oblige them to u&s;e precautions inconvenient to them, and &s;ervice|able to us.</P>
<P>As an accurate knowledge of the country is e&s;&s;ential to a good defence,&mdash;and as the enemy's approach may be &s;ud|den, and we may be called to act, without having time, when it happens, to examine it &s;ufficiently if it is not done beforehand, it would an&s;wer a valuable purpo&s;e to have it immediately carefully reconnoitred, and &s;ketches taken of all the landing places, great roads, and by-paths, encamp|ing grounds, heights, rivers, creeks, mora&s;&s;es, and every thing that it can be of any importance to know.

<P>GENERAL Newcomb having informed me that he had collected a body of about five hundred Jer&s;ey militia at Woodbury, I have de&s;ired him to endeavour to keep them together while matters remain in their pre&s;ent uncertainty and &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and to employ them in whatever works may be carrying on at Billing&s;port or Red-bank for the defence of the river. I mention this, that, if it &s;hall be thought proper, mon&s;ieur Du Coudray may be directed to call for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e militia accordingly.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MONSIEUR Du Coudray has laid before me a plan of the river, by which it appears that, for a con&s;ider|able &s;pace between the two &s;and-banks on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Fort-I&s;land, there is from four to four and a half fathoms depth of water. According to this repre&s;entation, there would be room for three frigates to lie between tho&s;e banks in &s;uch a po&s;ition as to en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ilade the works at Fort-I&s;land, and make it difficult to maintain them.</P>
<P>There are but two ways of remedying this inconveni|ence;&mdash;one by having a &s;ufficient number of chevaux-de-fri&s;e &s;unk at the entrance between the two banks;&mdash;and the other, by having the le&s;t flank of Fort-I&s;land fortifica|tion &s;upported by a good battery capable of re&s;i&s;ting the cannon of the &s;hips, and obliging them to quit their &s;tation. The fir&s;t is evidently preferable, becau&s;e the efficacy of it will be more certain. A few chevaux-de-fri&s;e properly placed might effectually bar all acce&s;s to the &s;hips: but there is a po&s;&s;ibility that any battery we can con&s;truct might be overpowered by the fire of the &s;hipping: and as
<PB N="135" REF="029737_0473_0FE29AC6DEDE5418">
we have few cannon, and Fort-I&s;land is it&s;elf a mar&s;hy &s;pot, incapable of affording earth for the batteries nece&s;&s;ary to be rai&s;ed upon it, which mu&s;t be brought from the oppo|&s;ite &s;hore,&mdash;it would not be prudent to multiply works there more than cannot be avoided. It would al&s;o be a great advantage gained, to &s;ecure the I&s;land from annoyance ex|cept in one point, and that in front, from only three &s;hips at a time,&mdash;which would be effected by &s;topping up the pa&s;&s;age between the two banks with chevaux-de-fri&s;e. I &s;hould therefore think it of importance to have this mea&s;ure immediately adopted and carried into execution.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour of addre&s;&s;ing a few lines to Congre&s;s on a &s;ubject which appears to me of infinite im|portance, and to have a claim to their &s;erious attention. The matter I allude to is the exorbitant price exacted by merchants and venders of goods for every nece&s;&s;ary they di&s;po&s;e of. I am &s;en&s;ible the trouble and ri&s;k in importing give the adventurers a right to a generous price, and that &s;uch, from motives of policy, &s;hould be paid: but yet I cannot conceive that they, in direct violation of every prin|ciple of genero&s;ity, of rea&s;on, and of ju&s;tice, &s;hould be al|lowed (if it is po&s;&s;ible to re&s;train them) to avail them&s;elves of the difficulties of the times, and to ama&s;s fortunes upon the public ruin.</P>
<P>This grievance is now an object of univer&s;al complaint, and of univer&s;al apprehen&s;ion: and the con&s;equences that are likely to re&s;ult from a continuance of it excite in every well-affected mind the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable feelings. The inclo&s;ed copy of a memorial from a part of the Penn&s;ylva|nia officers &s;hews their &s;entiments upon the &s;ubject: and I am per&s;uaded tho&s;e of the whole army are &s;imilar, as they have and do experience the gro&s;s abu&s;es they com|plain of. I know that ways and means for preventing this evil wholly, are difficult (if practicable) to find out: but I &s;hould hope that Congre&s;s them&s;elves, or the &s;upreme
<PB N="136" REF="029737_0474_0FE29A6BA7DB8590">
powers in the re&s;pective States, through their recommenda|tion, may devi&s;e &s;ome mode by which it may be redre&s;&s;ed in part.</P>
<P>I think there are two mea&s;ures, which, if adopted and put under proper regulations, would be of con&s;iderable &s;av|ing to the public, and to the army, at the &s;ame time that they would contribute a good deal to do away part of the unea&s;ine&s;s of the latter, ari&s;ing from the enormous prices they are compelled to pay for nece&s;&s;aries. The fir&s;t is the e&s;tabli&s;hment of public tanneries in three or four of the States, under care of a judicious commi&s;&s;ary or director, to which all the hides of the cattle killed for the army &s;hould be carried, and tanned. There &s;hould be al&s;o deputies to attend the army to collect the hides: and it appears to me that e&s;tabli&s;hing the tanneries in different States,&mdash;for in|&s;tance one in this, and another in Connecticut,&mdash;will be much more advi&s;eable than fixing only one in either of them; as the bu&s;ine&s;s may be carried on more exten&s;ively, with more convenience, and at le&s;s expen&s;e, than if the raw hides were to be tran&s;ported to one place only, from which probably there would be a nece&s;&s;ity of carrying them the whole di&s;tance back again after they were dre&s;&s;ed. This &s;ubject was under con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s once be|fore, and a commi&s;&s;ary (if I recollect, a Mr. Phillips) ap|pointed, who declined the office. Leather is of &s;uch e&s;|&s;ential u&s;e, and &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for &s;hoes and other purpo&s;es in the army, that too much care nor too effectual means cannot be taken to procure it.</P>
<P>What I have ventured to mention, if gone into, will add much to our &s;upplies, and, I am certain, will prevent the high and unju&s;tifiable prices demanded for this article when in the hands of private owners. Be&s;ides, at tho&s;e tanne|ries, a number of arti&s;ts, &s;uch as &s;hoe and harne&s;s makers, might be employed to work the leather up.</P>
<P>In like manner, &s;ince our imports of &s;pirit have become &s;o precarious, nay impracticable, on account of the enemy's fleet which infe&s;ts our whole coa&s;t,&mdash;I would beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t the propriety of erecting public di&s;tilleries in differ|ent States. The benefits ari&s;ing from the moderate u&s;e of &s;trong liquor have been experienced in all armies, and are not to be di&s;puted. In the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, our
<PB N="137" REF="029737_0475_0FE29AC9EF5C92A0">
&s;oldiery cannot obtain &s;uch &s;upplies as are ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary; and if they are fortunate enough to get any, it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the &s;utlers at mo&s;t extravagant rates, and at &s;uch as are in|credible to tell of. This is a &s;ource of much complaint, and, I &s;hould hope, may be removed by appointing proper per&s;ons to buy grain and di&s;til it for the army,&mdash;large quan|tities of which may be ea&s;ily procured, and on rea&s;onable terms, in many of the States.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the ob&s;ervation in the memorial about ra|tions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> certain the pre&s;ent allowed value is by no means &s;ufficient; nor does it an&s;wer the purpo&s;e intended. Since that was fixed, provi&s;ions, like every other article, though not from the &s;ame cau&s;es, have become extremely dear; and what at that time was a ju&s;t equivalent, is totally inade|quate now. This matter, I doubt not, will have the atten|tion of Congre&s;s, and &s;uch regulations be made re&s;pecting it, as may be right and equitable.</P>
<P>It appears to me, from the information I have received, that two companies, each to con&s;i&s;t of &s;ixty men at lea&s;t, under proper officers, of un&s;u&s;pected attachment, &s;pirit and activity,&mdash;&s;hould be immediately rai&s;ed, to guard the labo|ratory and &s;tores at Carli&s;le. Their &s;ecurity is of con&s;ider|able importance, and ought to be attended to. The&s;e com|panies, be&s;ides &s;erving as a guard, will be frequently of u&s;e as e&s;corts and convoys to &s;tores. If Congre&s;s &s;hould deem them nece&s;&s;ary, and order them to be enli&s;ted, yet I would recommend that they &s;hould not be rai&s;ed as merely &s;tation|ary or local,&mdash;having found from experience that regiments or companies formed upon &s;uch a footing enter upon other &s;ervices with great di&s;content and reluctance, though the occa&s;ion &s;hould be never &s;o pre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>In a letter of the thirteenth of June, I &s;ubmitted to Con|gre&s;s an application from the officers of cavalry re&s;pecting their hor&s;es,&mdash;whether they were to be provided at their own or the public expen&s;e. I al&s;o laid before them, in a letter of the fifth of July, captain Sullivan's requi&s;ition for pay. I &s;hall be glad to be honoured with their determination upon the&s;e &s;ubjects, and al&s;o in general re&s;pecting the line of conduct I &s;hould pur&s;ue as to the pay of officers taken pri&s;oners at any time before the clo&s;e of the la&s;t campaign, who have been permitted to be on parole;&mdash;and wheth|er

there is to be any di&s;tinction between &s;uch of them as are continued by new appointments, and tho&s;e who are not. I have frequent applications in the&s;e in&s;tances, and wi&s;h to know how to act.</P>
<P>Since the expre&s;s from general Schuyler left this, I re|ceived a letter from governor Clinton, a copy of which, and of its inclo&s;ures, I herewith tran&s;mit, as they give a much more favourable account of the affair at Fort-Schuy|ler, than was contained in his letter.</P>

<P>FROM the time which has clap&s;ed &s;ince general Howe departed from the Capes of Delaware, there is the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to conclude that he is gone far either to the ea&s;tward or &s;outhward, and with a de&s;ign to execute &s;ome determined plan. The danger of the &s;ea,&mdash;the inju|ry his troops mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain from being &s;o long confined,&mdash;the lo&s;s of time, &s;o late in the campaign,&mdash;will &s;carcely ad|mit a &s;uppo&s;ition that he is merely making a feint, and &s;till
<PB N="141" REF="029737_0479_0FE29ACCF74DBAE8">
intends to return either to Delaware or the North-river, without performing &s;ome enterpri&s;e fir&s;t in another quarter. The probability is in favour of a &s;outhern expedition, be|cau&s;e he has been &s;een, &s;ince his departure from the Capes, off Sinapuxent, &s;teering a &s;outhern cour&s;e,&mdash;and becau&s;e, had his de&s;tination been to the ea&s;tward, his arrival there, from the general &s;tate of the winds, mu&s;t have announced it before this, or his fleet would have been di&s;covered by &s;ome of the crui&s;ers on that coa&s;t.</P>
<P>If he is gone to the &s;outhward, he mu&s;t be gone far that way: for, had Che&s;apeak-bay been his object, he would have been there long &s;ince, and the fact well e&s;tabli&s;hed. Beyond that, there is no place &s;hort of Charle&s;ton, of &s;uf|ficient importance to engage his attention. The exten&s;ive commerce,&mdash;the va&s;t accumulation of military and other &s;tores in that town and its dependencies,&mdash;with the eclat it would give his arms if he &s;hould unfortunately take it,&mdash;afford him &s;tronger inducements to direct his operations there, than he could po&s;&s;ibly have el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Matters being thus circum&s;tanced, an important que&s;tion ari&s;es,&mdash;how this army is to be employed?&mdash;If his inten|tions are &s;uch as I have &s;uppo&s;ed them, it appears to me that an attempt to follow him would not only be fruitle&s;s, but would be attended with the mo&s;t ruinous con&s;equences. The di&s;tance is &s;o immen&s;e that general Howe might ac|compli&s;h every purpo&s;e he had in view, before we could po&s;&s;ibly arrive to oppo&s;e him; and &s;o long a march through an unhealthy climate at this &s;ea&s;on would debilitate and wa&s;te a principal part of our force. Added to this,&mdash;after we had made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s, he might ea&s;ily re|embark his troops and turn his arms again&s;t Philadelphia or el&s;ewhere, as he &s;hould think proper, without our being in a condition to give the lea&s;t aid.</P>
<P>As the&s;e, and many other rea&s;ons which will readily occur to Congre&s;s, will &s;hew the impracticability of our counteracting general Howe in that quarter with any good effect, we have no other alternative left than to remain here idle and inactive, on the remote probability of his re|turning this way,&mdash;or to proceed towards Hud&s;on's-river, with a view of oppo&s;ing general Burgoyne, or making an attempt on York-I&s;land, as the &s;ituation of affairs &s;hall
<PB N="142" REF="029737_0480_0FE29A703148DDF8">
point out. A &s;ucce&s;sful &s;troke with re&s;pect to either would be attended with the mo&s;t &s;ignal advantages, and would be the be&s;t compen&s;ation we could make for any lo&s;&s;es we may &s;u&s;tain to the &s;outhward. Be&s;ides the&s;e con|&s;iderations,&mdash;if, after all our conjectures and rea&s;oning up|on the &s;ubject, general Howe &s;hould be gone to the ea&s;t|ward to co-operate with Mr. Burgoyne, the army will be, by the movement propo&s;ed, &s;o far on its way, to prevent, I hope, the &s;ucce&s;s of his enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>The above rea&s;ons led me to call a council of general officers this morning, to take the &s;ubject of removing the troops from hence into con&s;ideration: and I am happy to inform Congre&s;s they were in &s;entiment with me upon the occa&s;ion, as they will perceive by a copy of the proceedings then had, which I do my&s;elf the honour of laying before them. Neverthele&s;s, as it is a movement which may in|volve the mo&s;t important con&s;equences, I have thought proper to &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s for their deliberation and deci&s;ion. If it is deemed expedient, we have perhaps not a moment to lo&s;e in carrying it into execution; and, un|der this per&s;ua&s;ion, I have &s;ent colonel Hamilton, one of my aides, (who will have the honour of delivering this) to bring me the re&s;ult of their opinion.</P>
<P>As the northern department has been all along con&s;id|ered &s;eparate, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;tinct, and there are &s;pecial re&s;olves ve&s;ting the command in particular per&s;ons,&mdash;in ca&s;e it &s;hould hereafter appear eligible to unite the two armies, it may perhaps be nece&s;&s;ary that Congre&s;s &s;hould place the matter upon &s;uch a footing as to remove all &s;cru|ples or difficulties about the command, that could po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e on my arrival there. This I reque&s;t, from a di&s;po&s;i|tion to harmony, and from my knowing the ill and fatal con&s;equences that have often ari&s;en from &s;uch controver|&s;ies, and not from the mo&s;t di&s;tant apprehen&s;ion that one would take place upon &s;uch an event.

As I cannot yet think that general Howe &s;eriou&s;ly intends to go into Che&s;apeak, I would by all means advi&s;e that an expre&s;s be immediately di&s;patched (if one has not already gone) to warn them of their danger, to let them prepare in the be&s;t manner for defence, and to advi&s;e them to remove all &s;upernumerary &s;tores.</P>

<P>I BEG leave to inform you that the army marched early this morning, and will encamp, I expect, this even|ing within five or &s;ix miles of Philadelphia. To-morrow morning it will move again, and I think to march it through the city, but without halting. I am induced to do this, from the opinion of &s;everal of my officers and many friends in Philadelphia, that it may have &s;ome influence on the minds of the di&s;affected there, and tho&s;e who are dupes to their artifices and opinions. The march will be down Front and up Che&s;nut-&s;treet, and, I pre&s;ume, about &s;even o'clock.</P>

<P>I LAST night had the honour of your favour of the twenty-fourth, with its inclo&s;ures. No letters came for you from general Schuyler; and therefore, agreeable to your reque&s;t, I tran&s;mit you a copy of one I received from him, and of the material papers which it covered. Among the copies, you will find general Burgoyne's in&s;tructions at large to lieutenant-colonel Baum, pointing out the objects of his command when he was fir&s;t detached. What we had before was after he marched, and was an an&s;wer to a report he had received from him. There was al&s;o a mi&s;|take in his name before, being called Bom in the copies &s;ent by general Lincoln.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be happy if the account re&s;pecting Staten-I&s;land &s;hould prove true:&mdash;I hope it will.</P>
<P>Two divi&s;ions of the army moved this morning, and will proceed after a &s;hort halt near this place to refre&s;h them&s;elves: the remainder will continue on their ground to-day, in order to re&s;t and recover from the fatigue of the march ye&s;terday and the day before.

<P>HAVING endeavoured, at the &s;olicitation of the count De Pula&s;ki, to think of &s;ome mode for employing him in our &s;ervice, there is none occurs to me, liable to &s;o few inconveniences and exceptions as the giving him the command of the hor&s;e.

The nature of the hor&s;e &s;ervice with us being &s;uch that they commonly act in detachments, a general officer with them is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than at the head of the brigades of infantry.

<P>I THIS minute returned to head-quarters, where I found your favour of this date, with the re&s;olves re&s;pecting general Sullivan, and colonel Richard&s;on's battalion. I had conver&s;ed with general Sullivan upon the &s;ubject, and ob&s;erved to him that it was nece&s;&s;ary an inquiry &s;hould be had relative to the affair of Staten-I&s;land, as his conduct was cen&s;ured, and much di&s;&s;atisfaction prevailed. He was &s;en&s;ible of the propriety of the mea&s;ure, and expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire that it &s;hould take place, provided he could have the benefit of general Smallwood's te&s;timony, who was on the expedition. That gentleman happens at this time to be in Maryland; which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily delay the inquiry, unle&s;s &s;ome mode can be agreed upon for obtaining his &s;entiments upon the matter.</P>
<P>This morning the enemy came out with a con&s;iderable force and three pieces of artillery, again&s;t our light advanc|ed corps, and, after &s;ome pretty &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;hing, obliged them to retreat,&mdash;being far inferior in number, and without cannon. The lo&s;s on either &s;ide is not yet a&s;certained: ours, though not exactly known, is not very considerable: theirs, we have rea&s;on to believe, was much greater, as &s;ome of our parties, compo&s;ed of expert mark&s;men, had opportunities of giving them &s;everal clo&s;e, well-directed fires,&mdash;more particularly in one in&s;tance, when a body of riflemen formed a kind of ambu&s;cade. They advanced about two miles this &s;ide of Iron-hill, and then withdrew to that place, leaving a piquet at Couch's mill, about a mile in front. Our parties now lie at White Clay creek, ex|cept the advanced piquets, which are at Chri&s;tiana bridge.</P>
<P>On Monday a large detachment of the enemy landed at Cecil court-hou&s;e; and this morning I had advice of their having advanced on the Newca&s;tle road as far as Car&s;on's tavern. Parties of hor&s;e were &s;ent out to reconnoitre them, which went three miles beyond the Red Lion, but could neither &s;ee nor hear of them; whence I conjecture they filed off by a road to their left, and fell in with their main body. The de&s;ign of their movement this morning &s;eems to have been to di&s;per&s;e our light troops who had been trouble&s;ome to them, and to gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Iron-hill,

<P>In re&s;pect to the militia reque&s;ted of Jer&s;ey, his excel|lency is doubtful whether they can be obtained: for gov|ernor Living&s;ton, by a late letter, informed him that he

had no expectation that more than three hundred of the thou&s;and called for to garri&s;on the po&s;ts in the Highlands, would march, notwith&s;tanding he had i&s;&s;ued orders for that purpo&s;e; and that three weeks would probably elap&s;e before that number went. If the requi&s;ition can be com|plied with, he has no doubt of general Dickin&s;on's exer|tions, and is &s;atisfied of the propriety of appointing him to the command. This, he imagines, would have followed of cour&s;e, as he is major-general of all the militia in the State, and has given ample te&s;timony, as well of his ca|pacity as of his firmne&s;s and bravery.</P>
<P>By de&s;erters and other intelligence, his excellency was informed la&s;t night that the enemy's whole force left Elk ye&s;terday, and advanced on the road towards Chri&s;tiana. The de&s;erters added that they had di&s;encumbered them|&s;elves of all their tents and baggage, and had &s;ent them back and re-embarked them.

<P>YESTERDAY evening I received the honour of your letter of the ninth, with its &s;everal inclo&s;ures.

<P>In re&s;pect to the &s;ubject of mon&s;ieur Du Coudray's let|ter, I would beg leave to ob&s;erve, however eligible the mea&s;ure might otherwi&s;e be which he recommends, an at|tempt to carry it into execution at this time would an&s;wer no valuable purpo&s;e, as the work in all probability could not be more than marked out when it would be wanted. I would al&s;o add that I do not conceive any great advan|tages could be derived from it, &s;uppo&s;ing it could be com|pleted,&mdash;as we are certain the enemy will never attack lines which they can avoid. If they were obliged to ap|proach Philadelphia by a particular route, in &s;uch ca&s;e no exertions &s;hould be &s;pared to erect works, and the adop|tion of the plan would be highly expedient.</P>
<P>The enemy are now lying near Kennet's Square, and in a tolerably compact body. They have parties advanced on the Lanca&s;ter road, and on tho&s;e leading over this ford and to Wilmington. Manoeuvring appears to be their plan. I hope, notwith&s;tanding, that we &s;hall be able to find out their real intended route, and to defeat their purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>By light-hor&s;emen this in&s;tant come in, the enemy are in motion, and appear to be advancing towards us. His excellency is giving the nece&s;&s;ary orders, and getting the troops under arms, which prevents him from &s;igning this him&s;elf, as was intended at fir&s;t.</P>

<P>WHEN I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you this morn|ing, I mentioned that the enemy were advancing, and had begun a cannonade. I would now beg leave to inform you that they have kept up a bri&s;k fire from their artillery ever &s;ince. Their advanced party was attacked by our light troops under general Maxwell, who cro&s;&s;ed the Brandi|wine for that purpo&s;e, and had po&s;ted his men on &s;ome high grounds on each &s;ide the road. The fire from our people was not of long duration, as the enemy pre&s;&s;ed on in force,&mdash;but was very &s;evere.</P>
<P>What lo&s;s the enemy &s;u&s;tained, cannot be a&s;certained with preci&s;ion: but, from our &s;ituation and the bri&s;kne&s;s
<PB N="156" REF="029737_0494_0FE29AEB94CDA730">
of the attack, it is the general opinion, particularly of tho&s;e who were engaged, that they had at lea&s;t three hundred men killed and wounded. Our damage is not exactly known: but, from the be&s;t accounts we have been able to obtain, it does not exceed fifty in the whole.</P>
<P>After this affair, the enemy halted upon the heights, where they have remained ever &s;ince, except a detachment of them which filed off about eleven o'clock from their left, and which has &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed Brandiwine a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Jones's ford, between five and &s;ix miles above Chad's.

There has been a &s;cattering loo&s;e fire between our parties on each &s;ide the creek &s;ince the action in the morning, which ju&s;t now became warm, when general Maxwell pa&s;&s;ed over with his corps, and drove them from their ground with the lo&s;s of thirty men left dead on the &s;pot, (among them a captain of the forty-ninth) and a number of entrenching tools with which they were throwing up a battery.</P>
<P>At half after four o'clock the enemy attacked general Sullivan at the ford next above this, and the action has been very violent ever &s;ince. It &s;till continues. A very &s;evere canonade has begun here too; and I &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hall have a very hot evening:&mdash;I hope it will be a happy one.</P>

<P>I AM &s;orry to inform you, that, in this day's engage|ment, we have been obliged to leave the enemy ma&s;ters of the field. Unfortunately, the intelligence received, of the enemy's advancing up the Brandiwine and cro&s;&s;ing at a ford about &s;ix miles above us, was uncertain and contra|dictory, notwith&s;tanding all my pains to get the be&s;t. This prevented me making a di&s;po&s;ition adequate to the force

with which the enemy attacked us on our right; in con&s;e|quence of which, the troops fir&s;t engaged were obliged to retire before they could be reinforced. In the mid&s;t of the attack on the right, that body of the enemy, which remain|ed on the other &s;ide of Chad's ford, cro&s;&s;ed it, and attacked the divi&s;ion there under the command of general Wayne, and the light troops under general Maxwell, who, after a &s;evere conflict, al&s;o retired. The militia under the com|mand of general Arm&s;trong, being po&s;ted at a ford about two miles below Chad's, had no opportunity of engaging.</P>
<P>But, though we fought under many di&s;advantages, and were, from the cau&s;es above mentioned, obliged to retire, yet our lo&s;s of men is not, I am per&s;uaded, very con&s;ider|able,&mdash;I believe much le&s;s than the enemy's. We have al&s;o lo&s;t &s;even or eight pieces of cannon, according to the be&s;t information I can at pre&s;ent obtain. The baggage, having been previou&s;ly moved off, is all &s;ecure, &s;aving the men's blankets, which being at their backs, many of them doubtle&s;s are lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I have directed all the troops to a&s;&s;emble behind Che&s;|ter, where they are now arranging for this night. Not|with&s;tanding the misfortune of the day, I am happy to find the troops in good &s;pirits: and I hope another time we &s;hall compen&s;ate for the lo&s;&s;es now &s;u&s;tained.</P>

<P>I HAVE been honoured with your favour of this date. I heartily wi&s;h the works on Delaware were com|pleted: but I think,&mdash;and in this opinion my officers con|cur,&mdash;that the &s;ervice will be injured if any part of the con|tinental troops were now to be employed about them. If

we &s;hould be able to oppo&s;e general Howe with &s;ucce&s;s in the field, the works will be unnece&s;&s;ary: if not, and he &s;hould force us from hence, he will certainly po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of them.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favour of ye&s;terday, with its &s;everal inclo|&s;ures, came to hand la&s;t night. Though I would willingly pay every attention to the re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s, yet, in the late in&s;tance re&s;pecting the recal of general Sullivan, I mu&s;t beg leave to defer giving any order about it till I hear further from that honourable body. Our &s;ituation at this time is critical and delicate; and nothing &s;hould be done to add to its embarra&s;&s;ments. We are now mo&s;t probably on the point of another action, and to derange the army by withdrawing &s;o many general officers from it, may and mu&s;t be attended with many di&s;agreeable if not ruinous con&s;equences. Such a proceeding at another time might not produce any bad effects: but how can the army be po&s;|&s;ibly conducted with a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, if the general of|ficers are taken off in the moment of battle?&mdash;Congre&s;s may rely upon it, &s;uch a mea&s;ure will not promote but in|jure the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>It is not my wi&s;h to prevent or to delay a proper inquiry into general Sullivan's conduct a &s;ingle in&s;tant, when the circum&s;tances of the army will admit: but now they pro|hibit it, and (I think) the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion in his command al&s;o. The recal of general St. Clair obliged me to part with general Lincoln whom I could but ill &s;pare; &s;o that the whole charge of his divi&s;ion is now upon general Wayne, there being no other brigadier in it than him&s;elf. The Maryland troops, if general Sullivan is taken away, will not have one general officer, general Smallwood being at the head of the militia coming from that State, and general De Borre &s;u&s;pended:&mdash;added to this, colonel Gift, who commands one regiment of them, is now from it by order. In a word, Sir, whether the charges alleged again&s;t general
<PB N="160" REF="029737_0498_0FE29AF643193E50">
Sullivan are true or fal&s;e, or whether his conduct has been exceptionable or not, I am &s;atisfied the re&s;olution for his recal at this time was unhappily adopted, and, if carried into execution, will not fail to add new difficulties to our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es: and I am obliged to ob&s;erve, in ju&s;tice to my own character, that I cannot be an&s;werable for the con&s;equences which may ari&s;e from a want of officers to a&s;&s;i&s;t me.</P>
<P>It gives me great plea&s;ure to find general Gates is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;pectable a footing; and I hope our affairs in that quar|ter, in the cour&s;e of a little time, will be in as pro&s;perous a train as we could rea&s;onably wi&s;h.</P>
<P>The main body of the enemy, from the be&s;t intelligence I have been able to get, lies near Dilworthtown, not far from the field of action, where they have been bu&s;ily em|ployed in burying their dead, which, from accounts, amount|ed to a very con&s;iderable number. We are moving up this road to get between the enemy and the Swedes' ford, and to prevent them from turning our right flank, which they &s;eem to have a violent inclination to effect, by all their movements.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to recommend in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, that &s;ome board or committee be appointed, or &s;ome mode adopted, for obtaining &s;upplies of blankets for the troops:&mdash;many are now without; and the &s;ea&s;on becoming cold, they will be injured in their health, and unfitted for &s;ervice, unle&s;s they are immediately provided with them. Our &s;upplies in this in&s;tance, as well as in every article of cloathing, cannot be too great, as there are frequent lo&s;&s;es not ea&s;ily to be avoided. I would al&s;o ob&s;erve that I think, in point of prudence and &s;ound policy, every &s;pecies of pro|vi&s;ions &s;hould be removed from the city, except &s;uch as will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply the pre&s;ent demands of this army. I have been told there are con&s;iderable quantities in private Lands, which &s;hould not be &s;uffered to remain a moment longer than they can be conveyed away.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you &s;ince your adjournment to Lanca&s;ter, and I &s;incerely wi&s;h that my fir&s;t letter was upon a more agreeable &s;ubject. The enemy, by a variety of perplexing manoeuvres through a country from which I could not derive the lea&s;t intelli|gence, (being to a man di&s;affected) contrived to pa&s;s the Schuylkill la&s;t night at the Flat-land and other fords in the neighbourhood of it. They marched immediately to|wards Philadelphia, and I imagine their advanced parties will be near that city to-night.</P>
<P>They had &s;o far got the &s;tart before I received certain intelligence that any con&s;iderable number had cro&s;&s;ed, that I found it in vain to think of overtaking their rear, with troops hara&s;&s;ed as ours had been with con&s;tant marching &s;ince the battle of Brandiwine; and therefore concluded, by the advice of all the general officers, to march from this place to-morrow morning towards Philadelphia, and on the way endeavour to form a junction with the conti|nental troops under general M^cDougal from Peek&s;kill, and the Jer&s;ey militia under general Dickin&s;on, both of whom are, I hope, on this &s;ide the Delaware. I am al&s;o oblig|ed to wait for general Wayne and general Smallwood, who were left upon the other &s;ide of Schuylkill, in hopes
<PB N="163" REF="029737_0501_0FE29B5D756FFE20">
of falling upon the enemy's rear:&mdash;but they have eluded them as well as us.</P>
<P>When I la&s;t recro&s;&s;ed the Schuylkill, it was with a firm intent of giving the enemy battle whereever I &s;hould meet them, and accordingly advanced as far as the Warren tavern upon the Lanca&s;ter road, near which place the two armies were upon the point of coming to a general engagement, but were prevented by a mo&s;t violent flood of rain, which continued all the day and following night. When it held up, we had the mortification to find that our ammunition, which had been completed to forty rounds a man, was entirely ruined; and in that &s;ituation we had nothing left for it but to find out a &s;trong piece of ground which we could ea&s;ily maintain till we could get the arms put into order, and a recruit of ammunition.</P>
<P>Before this could be fully effected, the enemy marched from their po&s;ition near the White-hor&s;e tavern, down the road leading to the Swedes' ford. I immediately cro&s;&s;ed the Schuylkill above them, and threw my&s;elf full in their front, hoping to meet them in their pa&s;&s;age, or &s;oon after they had pa&s;&s;ed the river. The day before ye&s;|terday they were again in motion, and marched rapidly up the road leading towards Reading. This induced me to believe that they had two objects in view,&mdash;one to get round the right of the army,&mdash;the other perhaps to detach parties to Reading where we had con&s;iderable quantities of military &s;tores.</P>
<P>To fru&s;trate tho&s;e intentions, I moved the army up on this &s;ide the river to this place, determined to keep pace with them: but early this morning I received intelligence that they had cro&s;&s;ed the fords below. Why I did not follow immediately, I have mentioned in the former part of my letter: but the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on again&s;t being able to make a forced march is the want of &s;hoes. Me&s;&s;ieurs Car|roll, Cha&s;e and Penn, who were &s;ome days with the army, can inform Congre&s;s in how deplorable a &s;ituation the troops are, for want of that nece&s;&s;ary article. At lea&s;t one thou&s;and men are bare-footed, and have performed the marches in that condition. I was told of a great number of &s;hoes in the hands of private people in Philadelphia, and &s;ent down to &s;ecure them: but I doubt the approach of the enemy will prevent it.</P>

I have planned a method of throwing a garri&s;on into Fort Mifflin. If it &s;ucceeds, and they, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;hips and gallies, &s;hould keep the ob&s;tructions in the river, general Howe's &s;ituation in Philadelphia will not be the mo&s;t agreeable: for if his &s;upplies can be &s;topped by water, it may be ea&s;ily done by land.

<P>YESTERDAY afternoon I had the honour to re|ceive your favours of the thirtieth ultimo with their in|clo&s;ures. I was much obliged by the accounts from the northern army, though in general they had reached me be|fore; and I flatter my&s;elf we &s;hall &s;oon hear that they have been &s;ucceeded by other fortunate and intere&s;ting events, as the two armies, by general Gates's letter, were encamped near each other.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING received intelligence through two inter|cepted letters, that general Howe had detached a part of his force for the purpo&s;e of reducing Billing&s;port and the forts on Delaware, I communicated the accounts to my general officers, who were unanimou&s;ly of opinion that a favourable opportunity offered to make an attack upon the troops which were at and near Germantown. It was ac|cordingly agreed that it &s;hould take place ye&s;terday morn|ing, and the following di&s;po&s;itions were made.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ions of Sullivan and Wayne, flanked by Con|way's brigade, were to enter the town by the way of Che&s;|nut-hill, while general Arm&s;trong with the Penn&s;ylvania militia &s;hould fall down the Manatawny road by Vandeer|ing's
<PB N="166" REF="029737_0504_0FE29B0419478AD8">
mill, and get upon the enemy's left and rear. The divi&s;ions of Greene and Stephen, flanked by M^cDougal's brigade, were to enter, by taking a circuit by way of the lime-kiln road, at the market-hou&s;e, and to attack their right wing; and the militia of Maryland and Jer&s;ey, under gen|erals Smallwood and Forman, were to march by the old York road, and fall upon the rear of their right. Lord Stirling, with Na&s;h and Maxwell's brigades, was to form a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orps-de-re&s;erve.</P>
<P>We marched about &s;even o'clock the preceding evening, and general Sullivan's advanced party, drawn from Con|way's brigade, attacked their piquet at Mount Airy or Mr. Allen's hou&s;e about &s;un-ri&s;e the next morning, which pre&s;|ently gave way; and his main body, con&s;i&s;ting of the right wing, following &s;oon, engaged the light-infantry and other troops encamped near the piquet, which they forced from their ground. Leaving their baggage, they retreated a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance, having previou&s;ly thrown a party into Mr. Chew's hou&s;e, who where in a &s;ituation not to be ea&s;ily forced, and had it in their power, from the windows, to give us no &s;mall annoyance, and in a great mea&s;ure to ob|&s;truct our advance.</P>
<P>The attack from our left column under general Greene began about three-quarters of an hour after that from the right, and was for &s;ome time equally &s;ucce&s;sful. But I cannot enter upon the particulars of what happened in that quarter, as I am not yet informed of them with &s;ufficient certainty and preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The morning was extremely foggy, which prevented our improving the advantages we gained, &s;o well as we &s;hould otherwi&s;e have done. This circum&s;tance, by concealing from us the true &s;ituation of the enemy, obliged us to act with more caution and le&s;s expedition than we could have wi&s;hed, and gave the enemy time to recover from the effects of our fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion: and, what was &s;till more unfortu|nate, it &s;erved to keep our different parties in ignorance of each other's movements, and hindered their acting in con|cert. It al&s;o occa&s;ioned them to mi&s;take one another for the enemy,&mdash;which, I believe, more than any thing el&s;e, contributed to the misfortune which en&s;ued. In the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing appearances, when every thing gave
<PB N="167" REF="029737_0505_0FE29B68643EBF60">
the mo&s;t flattering hopes of victory, the troops began &s;ud|denly to retreat, and entirely left the field, in &s;pite of every effort that could be made to rally them.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it may be &s;aid the day was rather unfor|tunate than injurious. We &s;u&s;tained no material lo&s;s of men, and brought off all our artillery, except one piece which was di&s;mounted. The enemy are nothing the better by the event; and our troops, who are not in the lea&s;t di&s;|pirited by it, have gained what all young troops gain by be|ing in actions. We have had however &s;everal valuable of|ficers killed and wounded, particularly the latter. General Na&s;h is among the wounded, and his life is de&s;paired of. As &s;oon as it is po&s;&s;ible to obtain a return of our lo&s;s, I will tran&s;mit it.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tice to general Sullivan and the whole right wing of the army, who&s;e conduct I had an opportunity of ob|&s;erving, as they acted immediately under my eye,&mdash;I have the plea&s;ure to inform you that both officers and men be|haved with a degree of gallantry that did them the highe&s;t honour.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you on the fifth, I have obtained a return of our lo&s;s in the action on Saturday, by which it appears to be much more con&s;ider|able than I at fir&s;t apprehended, though I always imagin|ed my&s;elf that it was greater than it was generally &s;uppo&s;|ed to be. The copy of the return inclo&s;ed will &s;hew the amount as it now &s;tands; but I hope many of tho&s;e who are mi&s;&s;ing will yet come in: I fear however there are &s;ev|eral under that denomination to be added to the number of the &s;lain, as the action was warm in every quarter, from
<PB N="168" REF="029737_0506_0FE29B05D149DB88">
the information of the officers who commanded the differ|ent attacks.</P>
<P>What lo&s;s the enemy &s;u&s;tained, I am not able preci&s;ely to a&s;certain: but from a variety of corre&s;ponding accounts of per&s;ons who left the city &s;ince, and tho&s;e of a de&s;erter, it was very con&s;iderable. The de&s;erter, who is intelligent, &s;ays general Agnew was killed, Sir William Er&s;kine wounded in the head and leg, and that their general lo&s;s, in killed and wounded, amounted to near eight hundred. Several reputable per&s;ons from the city corroborate this, particularly with re&s;pect to general Agnew's death: &s;ome &s;ay upwards of two hundred waggons with wounded were carried in after the action, and before they came out: and that it was the common belief there, the enemy had been &s;everely handled.</P>
<P>It is with much chagrin and mortification I add that every account confirms the opinion I at fir&s;t entertained, that our troops retreated at the in&s;tant when victory was declaring her&s;elf in our favour. The tumult, di&s;order, and even de&s;pair, which, it &s;eems, had taken place in the Briti&s;h army, were &s;carcely to be paralleled: and it is &s;aid, &s;o &s;trongly did the ideas of a retreat prevail, that Che&s;ter was fixed on as their rendezvous. I can di&s;cover no other cau&s;e for not improving this happy opportunity, than the extreme hazine&s;s of the weather.</P>
<P>My intention is to encamp the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at &s;ome &s;uitable place to re&s;t and refre&s;h the men, and recover them from the &s;till remaining effects of that di&s;order naturally at|tendant on a retreat. We &s;hall here wait for the rein|forcements coming on, and &s;hall then act according to circum&s;tances. General Varnum, with the detatchment from Peek&s;kill amounting to about twelve hundred, in+cluding officers, would be la&s;t night at Coryel's ferry. About five hundred militia from Virginia, and two hun|dred from Maryland, together with colonel Gib&s;on's State regiment con&s;i&s;ting of two hundred and twenty-&s;ix effec|tives, have already joined the army. Since the action, general Forman's brigade of Jer&s;ey militia has quitted us. The men began to be unea&s;y at their &s;ituation, and de&s;irous to return home: and as, by &s;ome intelligence received from general Dickin&s;on, there was rea&s;on to imagine there
<PB N="169" REF="029737_0507_0FE29B69E9379ED8">
might be a call for their &s;ervices in the Jer&s;ies, it was thought expedient to gratify their de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of our water defence on the Delaware is far from being as flattering as could be wi&s;hed. After &s;ome &s;light oppo&s;ition from the Jer&s;ey militia under general Newcomb, a detachment of the enemy took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Billing&s;port. This perhaps is an event of no material con&s;equence: but it is to be lamented that many of the officers and &s;eamen on board the gallies have manife&s;ted a di&s;po&s;ition that does them little honour. Looking upon their &s;ituation as de&s;perate, or probably from wor&s;e mo|tives, they have been guilty of the mo&s;t alarming de&s;er|tions: two whole crews, including the officers, have de|&s;erted to the enemy. I learn however by captain Brew|er, who is this moment arrived here from the fleet, that the accounts they have received from the city, of our late attack, were &s;uch as to have produced a favourable change, and to have in&s;pired them with more confidence. I would here ob&s;erve that the charge of bad conduct was by no means applicable to the whole:&mdash;far from it. He fur|ther adds that four of the enemy's &s;hips made an attempt ye&s;terday morning to weigh the chevaux-de-fri&s;e oppo&s;ite to Billing&s;port, but were repul&s;ed by our gallies,&mdash;which has al&s;o contributed to rai&s;e the &s;pirits of the &s;eamen. Our garri&s;on on Fort-I&s;land, con&s;i&s;ting of little more than two hundred continental troops under lieutenant-colonel Smith, appear determined to maintain their po&s;t to the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>I beg leave to mention to Congre&s;s that there is a great deficiency of general officers in this army. When the de|tachment coming from Peek&s;kill joins us, we &s;hall have thirteen brigades. The&s;e require as many brigadiers, and &s;ix major-generals:&mdash;in&s;tead of the&s;e, we &s;hall have only four major-generals and eleven brigadiers; and the deficien|cy will be &s;till increa&s;ed by the death of general Na&s;h, which, from every appearance, is momently to be expected. General Woodford's ab&s;ence, occa&s;ioned by his wound, adds to our embarra&s;&s;ments, though it will be but for a time. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, Congre&s;s will be &s;en&s;ible that the government of the army cannot go on with that energy which is e&s;&s;ential to its well-being and &s;ucce&s;s. Neither
<PB N="170" REF="029737_0508_0FE29B0753ABE768">
officers nor men will transfer the re&s;pect and obedience they pay to a general officer, to a colonel who happens to be appointed to the temporary command of a brigade; nor will he, knowing his authority to be only temporary, be as &s;olicitous to enforce it, as one who is con&s;cious he is to continue in the &s;tation he fills. Want of lei&s;ure pre|vents my being more particular at this time: but I &s;hall take the liberty, in a day or two, to point out the troops that are in want of general officers, with my ob&s;ervations on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I cannot however omit this opportunity of recommend|ing general M^cDougal to their notice. This gentleman, from the time of his appointment as brigadier,&mdash;from his abilities, military knowledge, and approved bravery,&mdash;has every claim to promotion. If I mi&s;take not, he was pa&s;&s;ed over in the la&s;t appointments of major-generals, and young|er officers preferred before him: but his di&s;intere&s;ted at|tachment to the &s;ervice prevented his acting in the manner that is cu&s;tomary in like circum&s;tances. This, I think, gives him a peculiar title to e&s;teem, and concurs with the opinion I have of his value as an officer, to make me wi&s;h it may appear advi&s;eable to Congre&s;s to promote him to one of the vacancies.</P>
<P>It would be well if the intended inquiry into the conduct of general St. Clair could be brought to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue; and, if he is acquitted to the &s;atisfaction of Congre&s;s, that, as his general character as an officer is good, he may be again re&s;tored to the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>By a letter this evening received from colonel Hawkes Hay of Haver&s;traw, dated the fifth at four o'clock, P. M. four &s;hips of war, a con&s;iderable number of armed ve&s;&s;els, eight tran&s;ports, and forty flat-bottomed boats, arrived that morning in the bay oppo&s;ite that place, and were landing troops at Verplank's-Point.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Wedne&s;day evening I received the honour of your letter of the &s;eventh with its &s;everal inclo&s;ures. The providing of &s;uitable quarters for the troops during the winter demands our attention: but I confe&s;s it is difficult to &s;ay where they will be. Sundry circum&s;tances may occur in the cour&s;e of the campaign, to render any provi&s;|ion, which might now be thought of, altogether improper.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to general Putnam's letter, though the ac|counts tran&s;mitted by colonel Hawkes Hay indicate that the enemy had &s;ome attack in contemplation, yet I cannot but think the force the general mentions to have been at New-York was greatly exaggerated. The highe&s;t number of the reinforcements, &s;aid to have arrived, is three thou|&s;and; and the&s;e are mentioned to be half boys. Other reports make it much le&s;s,&mdash;and &s;ome as low as five or &s;ix hundred. However, be it what it may, it is not in my power to grant him aid. Had the reinforcement arrived before the troops marched from Peek&s;kill, &s;o many might
<PB N="172" REF="029737_0510_0FE29B08D6EA5D10">
not have been ordered from thence. But the ca&s;e was oth|erwi&s;e, or at lea&s;t I was not appri&s;ed of their arrival; and the detachments from thence were directed by the ad|vice of my general officers, who had under con&s;ideration the &s;tate of the whole force at that po&s;t and its de|pendencies, according to a general return. At the &s;ame time I urged general Putnam to call in all his out-po&s;ts, and to write in pre&s;&s;ing terms to governor Trumbull <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o a&s;&s;i&s;t him with &s;ome militia.</P>
<P>I have not heard a &s;ingle &s;yllable more of the troops or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eet mentioned by colonel Hawkes Hay, except a vague report to-day that a number, &s;uppo&s;ed to be about fifteen hundred, had landed on this &s;ide the river at Haver&s;traw. If the fact is &s;o, it is probable, they mean to pa&s;s through the Clove and inve&s;t the forts. I have great confidence in the activity and bravery of governor Clinton; and I tru&s;t, if &s;uch is their view, they will meet at lea&s;t with a &s;pirited if not a &s;ucce&s;sful oppo&s;ition. I have &s;ent up lieu|tenant-colonel Radiere, one of the engineers, with orders to direct &s;uch other works as may appear nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>There was a very &s;evere cannonade on Wedne&s;day night: it began about twelve o'clock, and continued till ye&s;terday morning between &s;even and eight. I have not learned the occa&s;ion; but, from the direction, &s;uppo&s;e it was at Fort-Mifflin, or an engagement between our armed ve&s;&s;els and the enemy's &s;hips, which probably were making a &s;econd attempt again&s;t the chevaux-de-fri&s;e. I have determined to maintain the po&s;t at Red-Bank, if it can be done, and have detached colonel Greene there with his regiment of Rhode-I&s;land troops, con&s;i&s;ting of about two hundred and twelve effective privates. I have al&s;o written to general Newcomb of Jer&s;ey, pre&s;&s;ing him to give all the aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e can from the militia.</P>
<P>Since my letter of the &s;eventh we have been joined by more of the Virginia militia. The whole number now in camp amounts to about eleven hundred. Many of their arms are indifferent, and almo&s;t the whole are de&s;titute of pouches and other nece&s;&s;ary accoutrements.</P>
<P>On Sunday the enemy evacuated Billing&s;port. They left all our cannon, but burned the platforms and carriages.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="029737_0511_0FE29B735EC2C950">
Inclo&s;ed you will receive a letter addre&s;&s;ed to me by colonel Portail. Congre&s;s will judge of the contents, and decide upon them as they may think they merit.</P>
<P>The military che&s;t is nearly exhau&s;ted, not having more than ten thou&s;and dollars in it; and a large part of the army is to pay for the month of Augu&s;t. Be&s;ides their claims, large &s;ums are wanted by the quarter-ma&s;ter-general, and for other purpo&s;es. Congre&s;s, I hope, will order &s;uch immediate &s;upply to be forwarded to the payma&s;ter-general, as &s;hall be in their power.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 11.&mdash;I wi&s;h to know what &s;tores of le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d we have, and what expectations of further &s;upplies. I am rather unea&s;y on this head, as I have not been able to ob|tain &s;atisfaction on &s;ome inquiries within the cour&s;e of a few days.</P>
<P>The cannonade mentioned above was between our gallies and a detachment of the enemy who were attempting to throw up a battery at Webb's or the lowe&s;t ferry on Schuyl|kill. It has been repeated this morning. Their de&s;ign, in erecting this battery, probably is to cover their pa&s;&s;age to Province-I&s;land, from whence, by occupying the grounds about the pe&s;t-hou&s;es, they may expect to annoy Fort-Mifflin.</P>
<P>Our di&s;tre&s;s for want of &s;hoes and &s;tockings is amazing|ly great, particularly for want of the former. On this ac|count we have a great many men who cannot do duty, and &s;everal detained at the ho&s;pitals for no other cau&s;e. I mu&s;t reque&s;t Congre&s;s to continue their exertions to relieve us, and to direct every &s;upply of the&s;e and other nece&s;&s;aries to be forwarded as &s;oon as they po&s;&s;ibly can after they are collected. It will be proper to &s;end them on as fa&s;t as they can be procured, without waiting to make up a con&s;idera|ble quantity to be brought at one time.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you on the eleventh in&s;tant, nothing material has happened between our army and general Howe's. The inclo&s;ed copies of commodore Hazlewood and colonel Bradford's letters will &s;hew the &s;ituation of affairs in the navy and at Fort-Mifflin, on the eleventh,&mdash;which are the late&s;t accounts I have re|ceived from thence. But there has been a warm cannonade &s;ince, which continued, with but little intermi&s;&s;ion, till be|tween two and three o'clock ye&s;terday afternoon, when it cea&s;ed. The re&s;ult I have not heard; but I hope, from the determined &s;pirit of the fleet and the garri&s;on, matters continue as we could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>I received an expre&s;s la&s;t night from general Putnam, informing me of the capture of Fort-Montgomery, and the con&s;equent evacuation of Peek&s;kill. I &s;hould &s;end copies of his letters to me: but as the expre&s;s who brought them had di&s;patches for Congre&s;s, I conclude he has advi&s;ed them fully on the &s;ubject. The&s;e events may have an un|happy influence on our northern affairs: but as the Con|necticut militia &s;eem to be coming in fa&s;t, and governor Clinton is exerting him&s;elf to bring out the force of New-York,&mdash;if general Putnam can but keep pace with their fleet in their progre&s;s up the river, I hope he will be able
<PB N="175" REF="029737_0513_0FE29B77B70AE970">
to fru&s;trate their de&s;ign of relieving general Burgoyne, and that every thing will &s;till terminate well in that quarter.</P>
<P>It gives me pain to repeat &s;o often the wants of the army: and nothing would induce me to it but the mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ity. Every mode hitherto adopted for &s;up|plying them has proved inadequate, notwith&s;tanding my be&s;t endeavours to make the mo&s;t of the means which have been in my power. The inclo&s;ed return will &s;hew how great is our deficiency in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential articles. What new expedient Congre&s;s can devi&s;e for more effectually an&s;wering the&s;e demands, I know not, per&s;uaded as I am that their clo&s;e&s;t attention has not been wanting to a mat|ter of &s;o great importance: out, circum&s;tanced as we are, I am under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of troubling them, that if any new &s;ource can be opened for alleviating our di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, it may be embraced as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible; for it is impo&s;&s;ible that any army, &s;o unprovided, can long &s;ub&s;i&s;t, or act with that vigour which is requi&s;ite to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The return now inclo&s;ed is for troops pre&s;ent in camp; be&s;ides which, there are numbers in the &s;everal ho&s;pitals, totally de&s;titute of the nece&s;&s;aries they require to fit them for the field; and, on this account alone, are prevented from joining their corps. The recruits coming in are al&s;o in the &s;ame melancholy predicament. I cannot a&s;certain with preci&s;ion what quantity of cloathing is at this time in Mr. Mea&s;e's hands: but, from every account, what he has can admini&s;ter but a very partial relief. I know he is en|tirely bare of &s;ome of the mo&s;t capital articles we want.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to cartouch-boxes, without which it is im|po&s;&s;ible to act, I cannot find from my inquiries that there are any in &s;tore. Several of the continental troops are de|ficient in this in&s;tance; and, what adds to our di&s;tre&s;s, there are but very few of the &s;outhern militia that are provided. I am trying to make a collection about the country: but, from the information I have received, the mea&s;ure will be attended with but little &s;ucce&s;s. This want, though not remedied immediately, may be removed in time; and I would take the liberty to recommend that the earlie&s;t at|tention &s;hould be had to making a large &s;upply. I would al&s;o advi&s;e that much care &s;hould be u&s;ed in choo&s;ing the
<PB N="176" REF="029737_0514_0FE29B15086DF198">
leather:&mdash;none but the be&s;t and thicke&s;t is proper for the purpo&s;e; and each box &s;hould have a &s;mall inner flap for the greater &s;ecurity of the cartridges again&s;t the rain and moi&s;t weather. The flaps in general are too &s;mall, and do not project &s;ufficiently over the ends or &s;ides of the boxes. I am convinced of the utility, nay nece&s;&s;ity, of the&s;e improve|ments, and that the adoption of them, though they will incur an additional expen&s;e at fir&s;t, will prove a con&s;idera|ble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aving, and of the mo&s;t beneficial con&s;equences: for we know from unhappy experience, in the &s;evere rain on the &s;ixteenth ultimo, the few boxes we had of this con|&s;truction pre&s;erved the ammunition without injury, whil&s;t it was almo&s;t wholly de&s;troyed in tho&s;e of the common form with a &s;ingle flap.</P>
<P>There is one thing more which I cannot omit men|tioning to Congre&s;s, and which, in my opinion, has a claim to their mo&s;t &s;erious attention,&mdash;I mean the general defective &s;tate of the regiments which compo&s;e our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|mies. Congre&s;s will find, from a view of the returns tran&s;mitted from time to time, that they do not amount to half of their ju&s;t complement. What can be done to remedy this, I know not: but it is certain every idea of voluntary enli&s;tments &s;eems to be at an end; and it is equally certain that the mode of draughting has been car|ried on with &s;uch want of energy in &s;ome States, and &s;o much di&s;regarded in others, that but a &s;mall acce&s;&s;ion of force has been derived from it. The&s;e facts are &s;ufficient|ly intere&s;ting of them&s;elves. But there are others to be added. I am told that Virginia, in her regulations for draughting, extended her plan only to the nine regiments that were fir&s;t rai&s;ed. In what policy this was founded, I cannot determine: but the other &s;ix are to receive no reinforcements from that &s;ource. Nor do matters &s;top here. The engagements of the fir&s;t nine regiments, I am informed, were temporary: and, according to the officer's accounts, the longe&s;t period to which any of the men are bound to &s;erve is next April:&mdash;many are not obliged &s;o long: and there are &s;ome who claim a di&s;charge at this time. I do not mention the&s;e things through choice, but from a principle of duty, to the end that Congre&s;s may de|vi&s;e &s;ome timely and effectual provi&s;ion for the whole, if
<PB N="177" REF="029737_0515_0FE29B806236CA00">
&s;uch &s;hall be in their power. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to enlarge upon the &s;ubject; and I will only ob&s;erve that the con&s;e|quences of calling the militia [<HI>into the field in</HI>] the cour&s;e of the war have been &s;o &s;everely and ruinou&s;ly felt, that I tru&s;t our views will never be turned to them but in ca&s;es of the greate&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, a court of in|quiry has &s;at upon general Sullivan. They met on the tenth, and continued the examination till the twelfth, when they came to the inclo&s;ed opinion. The depo&s;itions and papers which were before the court were many and prolix. They are not tran&s;mitted: but they may be obtained from the court, if wanted. Be&s;ides the depo&s;itory proofs which they had of wounded and dead officers, they had many gentlemen before them in per&s;on.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favours of the twelfth and thirteenth in&s;tant, with their &s;everal inclo|&s;ures. In re&s;pect to the re&s;olution directing a flag to be &s;ent to general Howe, I am inclined to think that the informa|tion upon which it was framed was without foundation. The letters which have come from our officers who have been lately taken generally mention that their treatment has been tolerably good; and &s;uch privates as have e&s;caped have &s;aid nothing in the cour&s;e of their examination, of their having been compelled to work. For the&s;e rea&s;ons I have taken the liberty to decline <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ending the flag. At the &s;ame time Congre&s;s may be a&s;&s;ured, if our pri&s;oners &s;uffer any wrongs, I &s;hall take every means in my power to have them redre&s;&s;ed as &s;oon as I am appri&s;ed of them.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="029737_0516_0FE29B168A54BAC8">
It is with the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction I congratulate Congre&s;s on the &s;ucce&s;s of our arms at the northward in the action of the &s;eventh,&mdash;an event of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting import|ance at this critical juncture. From the happy train in which things then were, I hope we &s;hall &s;oon hear of the mo&s;t deci&s;ive advantages.</P>
<P>We moved this morning from the encampment at which we had been for &s;ix or &s;even days pa&s;t, and are ju&s;t arrived at the grounds we occupied before the action of the fourth. One motive for coming here is to divert the enemy's atten|tion and force from the forts. The&s;e they &s;eem to con&s;id|er as capital objects, and (from their operations) mean to reduce, if po&s;&s;ible. At pre&s;ent their de&s;igns are directed again&s;t Fort-Mifflin and the chevaux-de-fri&s;e. I have therefore detached a further reinforcement to the garri&s;on.</P>
<P>I ye&s;terday, through the hands of Mrs. * * *, received a letter of a very curious and extraordinary nature from Mr. D * * *, which I have thought proper to tran&s;mit to Congre&s;s. To this ridiculous, illiberal performance. I made a &s;hort reply, by de&s;iring the bearer of it, if &s;he &s;hould hereafter by any accident meet with Mr. D * * *, to tell him I &s;hould have returned it unopened, if I had had any idea of the contents;&mdash;ob&s;erving at the &s;ame time, that I highly di&s;approved the intercour&s;e &s;he &s;eemed to have been carrying on, and expected it would be di&s;continued. Notwith&s;tanding the author's a&s;&s;ertion. I cannot but &s;u&s;|pect that the mea&s;ure did not originate with him; and that he was induced to it by the hope of e&s;tabli&s;hing his intere&s;t and peace more effectually with the enemy.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I LAST night had the honour to receive your letter of the &s;eventeenth in&s;tant, with its &s;everal inclo&s;ures.</P>
<P>I heartily wi&s;h the States may feel the importance of fill|ing their battalions, and may, in con&s;equence of the rec|ommendation of Congre&s;s, adopt &s;uch mea&s;ures as will prove effectual for the purpo&s;e. I cannot but think that heretofore there has been a want of attention in this in&s;tance,
<PB N="179" REF="029737_0517_0FE29BA0C8FDAE78">
and that the &s;ubject, though intere&s;ting to the la&s;t degree, has been viewed with too much indifference. The re&s;olu|tion re&s;pecting de&s;erters, I hope will al&s;o have their notice. It is highly nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould come into &s;ome regu|lations for apprehending them, and puni&s;hing tho&s;e who give them countenance. If this is not done, our force will be always dimini&s;hing, and no exertions in the army will prevent it. I &s;hall try the effects of a proclamation on tho&s;e who are now delinquents, and &s;hall be happy if it meets with &s;ucce&s;s; but confe&s;s, from the experiment I have made, that I am not &s;anguine in my expectations that it will be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the recruiting officers, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that, not|with&s;tanding the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s of the thirty-fir&s;t of July, and my circular letter on the &s;ubject of it to ma|ny of the States, I have not received an account that any officers have been appointed, except in Connecticut and Jer&s;ey.</P>
<P>On Sunday the enemy evacuated Germantown, and with|drew them&s;elves within their lines near the city. They &s;eem determined to reduce the forts, if po&s;&s;ible; and, for this purpo&s;e, have thrown &s;everal parties over on Province-I&s;land. I was informed this afternoon that a detachment al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed the Delaware at Cooper's ferry in the morning. If the account be true, (and I have no doubt of it) it is high|ly probable they mean to make an attack upon the garri&s;on at Red-Bank. I am taking every mea&s;ure in my power to counteract them, and have written to generals Forman and Newcomb of Jer&s;ey to afford every aid they can to relieve the fort, in ca&s;e they do inve&s;t it.</P>
<P>Again&s;t Fort-Mifflin they have kept up a cannonade, more or le&s;s, every day, and have thrown &s;everal &s;hells, but without doing any con&s;iderable damage. The explo&s;ion of one killed a private, and wounded three others, who were in a barrack where it fell. They al&s;o &s;et fire to two ammunition-boxes with a hot ball on the nineteenth, which did &s;ome injury to the barracks. I do not recollect that we have &s;uffered lately in any in&s;tances be&s;ides the&s;e.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour of tran&s;mitting to Congre&s;s the inclo&s;ed copies of &s;undry letters ju&s;t now received, and congratulate them mo&s;t &s;incerely on the important intelli|gence which they contain. The damage the enemy have &s;u&s;tained in their &s;hips, I hope, will prevent their future at|tempts to gain the pa&s;&s;age of the river; and the repul&s;e of the troops under count Donnop, and his captivity, I flatter my&s;elf, will al&s;o be attended with the mo&s;t happy con&s;e|quences. At the time the&s;e actions happened, a &s;upply of ammunition was on the way to the forts; and I have al&s;o ordered a further quantity to be immediately &s;ent.</P>
<P>By colonel Blaine, one of the i&s;&s;uing commi&s;&s;aries, who left Red-Bank in the morning before the action, I am hap|pily informed that he had thrown con&s;iderable &s;upplies of provi&s;ion into both garri&s;ons. He al&s;o adds that he came from Jer&s;ey this morning, and that the enemy had recro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> the Delaware and returned to Philadelphia. I have written to colonel Greene that the pri&s;oners mu&s;t be immediately &s;ent from his po&s;t: and Mr. Clymer, a deputy under Mr. Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dinot, will &s;et out to-morrow morning to make a prop|er di&s;po&s;ition of them.</P>
<P>It gives me great concern to inform Congre&s;s, that, after all my exertions, we are &s;till in a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation for want of blankets and &s;hoes. At this time no incon&s;idera|ble part of our force are incapable of acting, through the deficiency of the latter; and I fear, without we can be re|lieved, it will be the ca&s;e with two-thirds of the army in the cour&s;e of a few days.</P>
<P>I am and have been waiting with the mo&s;t anxious in|patience for a confirmation of general Burgoyne's &s;urrender. I have received no further intelligence re&s;pecting it (except vague report) than the fir&s;t account which came to hand &s;o long ago as Saturday morning. If Congre&s;s have had authentic advices about it, I wi&s;h to be favoured with them.</P>

<P>I WAS duly honoured with Mr. Hancock's letter if the twenty-fifth, with its &s;everal inclo&s;ures. I &s;hall take the ca&s;e of John More under con&s;ideration, and will tran&s;|mit colonel Ma&s;on my determination upon the &s;ame.</P>
<P>At this time I cannot inform the commi&s;&s;ary whether any alterations have or have not been made by general orders in the original ration e&s;tabli&s;hment. I have been under the nece&s;&s;ity, from time to time, to &s;end away my orderly books; and they are nece&s;&s;ary to be examined upon the &s;ubject. However, I think it probable that a departure from the fir&s;t allowance may have been found expedient, and direct|ed by &s;ome authority, or the commi&s;&s;ary would not have adopted it. In re&s;pect to the alteration referred to my con|&s;ideration, it is a matter of con&s;equence, and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;ired the general officers to inform them&s;elves whether it will be agreeable to the army at large, or what other regulations may be nece&s;&s;ary in this in&s;tance. As &s;oon as I have their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ments, I will write to Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The enemy &s;till con&s;ider the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our po&s;ts upon the river of great importance; and, from their preparation of fa&s;cines, &amp;c. and the be&s;t information I have been able to obtain, they will make further efforts to carry them. Viewing them in this light my&s;elf, and imagining that they would per&s;evere in their plans to occupy them, I wrote &s;ome days ago in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing terms to generals Dickin&s;on, Forman, and * * *, to afford every aid in their power from the militia of Jer&s;ey. As yet we have receiv|ed but little; and I have no encouragement to expect that it will be much augmented in a &s;hort time. This does not proceed from a want of activity and exertion on the part of the two fir&s;t mentioned gentlemen, who&s;e conduct and zeal upon every occa&s;ion give them a claim to the public e&s;teem, but in a con&s;iderable degree from the peculiar cir|cum&s;tances of their State at this time. The apprehen&s;ions of an inva&s;ion from Staten-I&s;land keep a large proportion of the militia from the ea&s;tern and upper part of the State al|mo&s;t con&s;tantly employed at and in the neighbourhood of Elizabeth-Town: and Mr. Living&s;ton's powers as gover|nor being expired, and no provi&s;ion made (it &s;eems) for
<PB N="182" REF="029737_0520_0FE29B25AC4CBA90">
&s;uch a contingency,&mdash;there are none of &s;ufficient authority to order them out, till a new appointment can be had:&mdash;at lea&s;t there is ground to &s;u&s;pect that the orders and exertions of the&s;e two gentlemen, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by civil authority, will not be attended with the advantages we wi&s;h, and which our affairs require. * * *</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances I have been obliged to detach a further reinforcement of continental troops under general Varnum, to maintain the two garri&s;ons, if po&s;&s;ible,&mdash;be&s;ides &s;ailors drawn from the line, to man the gallies. This de|tachment, when it arrives, added to the force now in the forts, will make the whole amount to &s;ixteen hundred ef|fective rank and file &s;ent from this army.</P>
<P>After the action of the fourth ultimo at Germantown, I hoped we &s;hould have been in a &s;ituation to attack the ene|my again on tho&s;e grounds, and with more &s;ucce&s;s than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the former in&s;tance; but this I was not able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. The &s;evere rain on the &s;ixteenth of September,&mdash;the action on the fourth,&mdash;the removal of our &s;tores, and having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> form a new elaboratory,&mdash;added to the &s;mall number <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hands engaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s of it,&mdash;laid us under di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|ties in the capital and e&s;&s;ential article of ammunition, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> could not be &s;urmounted. Every exertion was directed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> obtain &s;upplies; but (notwith&s;tanding) they were inade|quate, too &s;canty, and in&s;ufficient to attempt any thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a large and general &s;cale, before the enemy withdrew them|&s;elves. With what we had, in ca&s;e an experiment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> been made, fortune might have decided in our favour for the pre&s;ent; but we &s;hould not have been afterwards in a &s;ituation to maintain the advantage we might have gained: and if a repul&s;e had taken place, and the enemy pur&s;ued,&mdash;for want of a re&s;erve we might have been expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent danger of being ruined. The di&s;tre&s;s of the &s;oldiers for want of &s;hoes was al&s;o a powerful ob&s;tacle to the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h that our circum&s;tances were now &s;uch as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> authori&s;e a general attack for di&s;lodging them from the city: but I think that they are not. This al&s;o is the opinion of my general officers, upon a full and comprehen&s;ive view of matters, as Congre&s;s will perceive by the inclo&s;ed copy of the minutes of council on the twenty-ninth ultimo, which
<PB N="183" REF="029737_0521_0FE29BA8A5DBC1D8">
I have taken the liberty to tran&s;mit and lay before them. The &s;uperiority of numbers on the part of the enemy, in re&s;pect to regular troops,&mdash;their &s;uperior di&s;cipline, and the redoubts and lines which they have thrown up between the two rivers and about the city,&mdash;the happy &s;tate of our af|fairs at the northward, and the practicability of drawing &s;uccours from thence,&mdash;the con&s;equences of a defeat,&mdash;the&s;e were all motives which led to a deci&s;ion again&s;t an attack at this time.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent colonel Hamilton, one of my aides, to gen|eral Gates, to give him a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of things, and to explain to him the expediency of our receiving the rein|forcements which have been determined nece&s;&s;ary, if they will not interfere with and fru&s;trate any important plans he may have formed. Indeed I cannot conceive that there is any object now remaining, that demands our attention and mo&s;t vigorous efforts &s;o much as the de&s;truction of the army in this quarter. Should we be able to effect this, we &s;hall have little to fear in future.</P>
<P>General Howe's force, according to the &s;tate now made, is more con&s;iderable than it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be. I did not think it quite &s;o great my&s;elf, but always imagin|ed the common e&s;timate much too low:&mdash;nor can I po&s;i|tively &s;ay what it really is. However, there are &s;trong rea&s;ons to believe that it is not over-rated. After the evac|uation of Germantown, an almo&s;t infinite number of &s;craps and bits of paper were found, which, being &s;eparated and arranged with great indu&s;try and care, bear the marks of genuine and authentic returns at different periods. The manner in which they were de&s;troyed and di&s;po&s;ed of gives no room to &s;u&s;pect that it was the effect of de&s;ign. In ad|dition to this, I am informed by general Putnam that he had heard a reinforcement of four regiments was coming round to Delaware from New-York.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed return will give Congre&s;s a general view of the &s;trength of this army when it was made, and a par|ticular one of the forces of each State which compo&s;e it. By this they will perceive how greatly deficient the whole are in furni&s;hing their ju&s;t quotas. The militia from Mary|land and Virginia are no longer to be counted on:&mdash;all the former, except about two hundred, are already gone? and
<PB N="184" REF="029737_0522_0FE29B278B763440">
a few days, I expect, will produce the departure of the whole or chief part of the latter, from the importunate ap|plications which &s;ome of them have made. Be&s;ides this diminution, I am apprehen&s;ive we &s;hall have &s;everal men added to the &s;ick li&s;t by rea&s;on of the late exce&s;&s;ive rain and want of clothes.</P>
<P>We have not yet come to any determination re&s;pecting the di&s;po&s;ition of our troops for the winter,&mdash;&s;uppo&s;ing it a matter of great importance, and that for the pre&s;ent we &s;hould be &s;ilent upon it. The rea&s;ons will readily occur. By continuing the campaign, perhaps many &s;alutary if not deci&s;ive advantages may be derived; but it appears to me that this mu&s;t depend upon the &s;upplies of cloathing which the men receive. If they cannot be accommodated in this in&s;tance, it will be difficult if not impo&s;&s;ible to do it without effecting their de&s;truction.</P>
<P>I would take the liberty to mention that I feel my&s;elf in a delicate &s;ituation with re&s;pect to the marquis La Fayette. He is extremely &s;olicitous of having a command equal to his rank, and profe&s;&s;es very different ideas, as to the purpo&s;es of his appointment, from tho&s;e Congre&s;s have mentioned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me:&mdash;he certainly did not under&s;tand them. I do not know in what light they will view the matter: but it ap|pears to me, from a con&s;ideration of his illu&s;trious and im|portant connexions,&mdash;the attachment which he has mani|fe&s;ted for our cau&s;e,&mdash;and the con&s;equences which his return in di&s;gu&s;t might produce,&mdash;that it will be advi&s;eable to gratify him in his wi&s;hes; and the more &s;o, as &s;everal gentlemen from France, who came over under &s;ome a&s;&s;ur|ances, have gone back di&s;appointed in their expectations. His conduct with re&s;pect to them &s;tands in a favourable point of view,&mdash;having intere&s;ted him&s;elf to remove their unea&s;ine&s;s, and urged the impropriety of their making any unfavourable repre&s;entations upon their arrival at home: and in all his letters, he has placed our affairs in the be&s;t &s;ituation he could. Be&s;ides, he is &s;en&s;ible, di&s;creet in his manners, has made great proficiency in our language, and, from the di&s;po&s;ition he di&s;covered at the battle of Brandi|wine, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a large &s;hare of bravery and military ardour.</P>
<P>There is a French gentleman here,&mdash;mon&s;ieur Vrigny, in who&s;e favour the marquis &s;eems much intere&s;ted.
<PB N="185" REF="029737_0523_0FE1BFB9ADEFEEF8">
He a&s;&s;ures me he is an officer of great merit, and, from that motive and a regard to the &s;ervice, wi&s;hes to &s;ee him promoted. The rank he holds in France, and his pre&s;ent expectations, are contained in the inclo&s;ed copy of a paper given me by the marquis. Mon&s;ieur Vrigny al&s;o has hon|ourable certificates of his &s;ervices, nearly corre&s;ponding with the marquis's account of them. If Congre&s;s are plea&s;ed to honour him with a commi&s;&s;ion in the army of the States, I mu&s;t try to employ him.</P>
<P>I took the liberty &s;ome &s;hort time ago to mention to Congre&s;s the &s;ituation of the nine fir&s;t rai&s;ed Virginia regi|ments, and the term for which they &s;tand engaged; and, con&s;idering that we &s;hould &s;uffer greatly by the lo&s;s of &s;o large a part of our force which have been long inured to &s;ervice, I thought it advi&s;eable to con&s;ult the officers com|manding them, upon the mode which &s;hould app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">r to them be&s;t calculated to re-enli&s;t them. They accordingly met, and reported their &s;entiments in writing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> copy of which I have inclo&s;ed. I do not know that expedients, more promi&s;ing of &s;ucce&s;s than tho&s;e they have pointed out, can be adopted.

The high &s;ums paid for &s;ub&s;titutes and draughts, of late, even in the militia &s;ervice, will make this nece&s;&s;ary: for the &s;oldiers, being well appri&s;ed of that fact, will not be induced to engage again during the war or for three years, for the u&s;ual p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">mium.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o lay before Congre&s;s a remon&s;trance by the &s;ubaltern officers of the Virginia line, founded on a reform I thought nece&s;&s;ary to take place in the regiments from that State. The&s;e, in their e&s;tabli&s;hment, were made to con&s;i&s;t of ten companies,&mdash;two more than were a&s;&s;igned to tho&s;e of the States in general. This, and the great di&s;pro|portion between the officers and men, induced me to reduce them to a level with the re&s;t belonging to the continent, in order to prevent a con&s;iderable unnece&s;&s;ary expen&s;e. To effect this, no new promotions are to be made in the two extra companies, viz. the ninth and tenth, either to vacan|cies

exi&s;ting at the time of the regulation, or to any future ones that may happen therein: and the &s;ubalterns are to remain in their rank and command till they can be promot|ed in the other eight companies, and their men incorporat|ed. This is what they complain of. I have made a &s;hort &s;tate of facts, and wi&s;h Congre&s;s to determine upon them and the remon&s;trance as they &s;hall think proper.</P>
<P>At the reque&s;t of governor Clinton, I have tran&s;mitted a copy of his letter to me, giving an account of general Vaughan's expedition up the North-river after the capture of Fort-Montgomery, and of the de&s;truction committed by his troops in burning King&s;ton and the hou&s;es and mills on the river. According to the late&s;t advices, they have re|turned again; and it is reported that they have de&s;troyed the barracks and forts, and gone to New-York:&mdash;but this is not confirmed.</P>
<P>A few days ago Mr. Franks of Philadelphia, agent for the Briti&s;h pri&s;oners, &s;ent out &s;ix thou&s;and continental dol|lars to Mr. Richard Graham of Virginia, for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the He&s;&s;ians and other pri&s;oners in that State. The policy of &s;uffering the enemy to &s;upport their pri&s;oners with money which they refu&s;e them&s;elves, and which they at|tempt to depreciate in every in&s;tance they po&s;&s;ibly can, ap|pears to me very que&s;tionable,&mdash;and the more &s;o, as it may be counterfeited. Be&s;ides, they have laid us under every difficulty they can devi&s;e, as to our pri&s;oners in their hands:&mdash;nothing will do for their &s;upport but hard money. If the enemy were obliged to furni&s;h the &s;ame, the quantity with us would be greater, and of cour&s;e the means of re|lieving ours, ea&s;ier. I do not know what con&s;equences a prohibition again&s;t receiving continental money or the cur|rency of any State from them might involve: I think the &s;ubject is worthy of the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s; and for that rea&s;on. I have mentioned it.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 3.&mdash;The report of the enemy's having de&s;troy|ed the forts and barracks on the North-river, and of their having returned to New-York, is confirmed. I this morn|ing received a letter from general Putnam upon the &s;ubject, a copy of which is tran&s;mitted. The information that they mean to reinforce general Howe, I doubt not is true: it has come through &s;everal channels, and nothing is more
<PB N="187" REF="029737_0525_0FE29BABADF968C0">
probable. As to their having a further expedition in view, it &s;eems to be que&s;tionable:&mdash;general Burgoyne's defeat, and the ea&s;tern troops being ready to be employed in an|other way, are circum&s;tances again&s;t the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Agreeable to my expectation, the Virginia militia are gone: &s;o that we have none now in aid of the continental troops, but tho&s;e of the State mentioned in the return, and a few from Maryland. I do not know what can or will be done to obtain further reinforcements of them; but it appears to me, taking matters in any point of light, that fur|ther aids &s;hould come from Virginia and Maryland: for, &s;hould we be able to accommodate the continental forces with clothes &s;o as to carry on a winter campaign, their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance will be material, either to maintain a blockade, or in any deci&s;ive &s;troke we may attempt. And if they can|not be &s;o provided, and we &s;hould be obliged to retire into quarters, their &s;ervice will be &s;till more nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;i&s;t in covering the country again&s;t incur&s;ions for forage and pro|vi&s;ions. The militia of this State, them&s;elves, &s;uppo&s;ing they &s;hould be tolerably vigorous in their exertions, will not be equal to the ta&s;k: at lea&s;t it will be difficult, if not impracticable, for them to do it. It is to be wi&s;hed that &s;uch as can be drawn out may be engaged to &s;erve three months, or two at lea&s;t, (if it can be effected) after their arrival in camp; and that a mode could be adopted to &s;up|ply their places with others at the expiration of their term, &s;hould the exigency o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> our affairs require it. A time for their contin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ance &s;hould be fixed, or they will always be unea&s;y and pu&s;hing off; and the longer circum&s;tances will admit it to be, the better; for, after the period recurs, for which they come, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to retain them a mo|ment. As to the number that &s;hould be required, it is dif|ficult to determine: however, it is likely it will fall &s;hort of the requi&s;ition, as it ever has upon &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>There is a report prevailing in camp, which has come through &s;everal channels, that a &s;ucce&s;sful expedition has been made upon Rhode-I&s;land, and eight hundred pri&s;|oners taken, with &s;everal pieces of artillery, and a large quantity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alt.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour to inclo&s;e you an extract of a letter from major general Dickin&s;on, of the &s;ixth in&s;tant, by which it appears that a reinforcement has &s;ailed from New-York, either for general Howe or &s;ome other expe|dition. I have not yet heard whether any of the troops on their march from the northward have yet cro&s;&s;ed the North-river; but I hope they will be with me near as &s;oon as general Howe's reinforcement can arrive at Phila|delphia.</P>
<P>There was a heavy firing of cannon, all the day of the fifth, down the river; and in the evening &s;ome mu&s;ketry was heard; from whence we concluded that an attack had been made upon Fort-Mifflin. But it turned out to be an attack made by general Varnum, with a twelve and an eigh|teen-pounder fixed near Red-Bank, upon the enemy's &s;hips. He thinks he damaged the Somer&s;et of &s;ixty-four guns con|&s;iderably, as &s;he got on ground, and was for &s;ome time ex|po&s;ed to his fire. The &s;hips were obliged to quit their &s;ta|tions and fall lower down.</P>
<P>From a variety of accounts and circum&s;tances, I am in|duced to believe that the enemy are meditating a grand blow again&s;t Fort-Mifflin. I have put the place in as good a &s;tate of defence as my pre&s;ent numbers will admit, and have directed general Varnum to afford every further a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in his power. I therefore hope they will meet a warm reception whenever they make the attempt.</P>
<P>The military che&s;t is again empty, and the army is un|paid for the months of September and October,&mdash;be&s;ides the draughts that are requi&s;ite for the commi&s;&s;ary and quar|ter-ma&s;ter-general's department. You will therefore be

<P>I fear, from a letter which I have lately received from gen|eral Heath, that no proper mea&s;ures are taken to put up a &s;upply of &s;alt provi&s;ions for next campaign, to the ea&s;tward. I have inclo&s;ed a copy of general Heath's letter to Mr. Buchanan, the commi&s;&s;ary-general of purcha&s;es, and have de&s;ired him to have the matter looked into in time: but it is of &s;o much importance to the very exi&s;tence of the ar|my, that I think it de&s;erves the attention of Congre&s;s.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favours of the fourth and fifth in&s;tant, with their &s;everal inclo&s;ures. Among tho&s;e of the former, I found the re&s;olution you are plea&s;ed to allude to, re&s;pecting your appointment as pre&s;i|dent. Permit me, Sir, to congratulate you upon this event, and to a&s;&s;ure you I have the mo&s;t entire confidence that I &s;hall experience in you during your pre&s;idency the &s;ame politene&s;s, and attention to the intere&s;ts of the States, that marked the conduct of your worthy predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the views of the navy-board for &s;ecuring the frigates, the &s;ituation of the army would not admit of a compliance with them, &s;uppo&s;ing they would an&s;wer the end. I have therefore written to the board in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing terms, to have the frigates &s;cuttled in &s;uch way that they may be rai&s;ed when it &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary, and that in the mean time they may not be liable to injury from float|ing ice. I &s;ee no mea&s;ure &s;o likely to &s;ecure them to us, and again&s;t the enemy's attempts. I have been extremely fearful they would have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and employed them, with the Delaware and their batteries, on the rear of the gallies and the fort, while the &s;hips below attacked in front. I need not point out the probable con&s;equences of &s;uch an event: they are too obvious.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="029737_0528_0FE29B37AD8DC228">
The re&s;olves which you reque&s;t to be communicated to the army &s;hall be publi&s;hed in general orders. The let|ters for commodore Hazelwood, &amp;c. have been put in a proper channel of conveyance.</P>
<P>As to the di&s;po&s;ition of part of the northern army, my letter of the fir&s;t, continued to the third, contains my ideas upon the &s;ubject, and tho&s;e of my general officers. I &s;hall be &s;orry if the mea&s;ures I have taken on this head &s;hould interfere with or materially vary from any plans Congre&s;s might have had in view. Their proceedings of the fifth, I pre&s;ume were founded on a &s;uppo&s;ition that the enemy were &s;till up the North-river, and garri&s;oning the forts they had taken. This not being the ca&s;e, and all accounts agreeing that reinforcements to general Howe are coming from York, I hope the aids I have required will be con&s;idered expedient and proper. Independent of the latter con&s;ideration, I think our exertions and force &s;hould be directed to effect general Howe's de&s;truction, if it is po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Among the various difficulties attending the army, the adju&s;tment of rank is not the lea&s;t. This,&mdash;owing to the &s;everal modes, the &s;everal principles, that have prevailed i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> granting commi&s;&s;ions,&mdash;is involved in great perplexity. The officers of the Penn&s;ylvania troops are in much con|fu&s;ion about it: in many in&s;tances, tho&s;e who were junior in rank, from local and other circum&s;tances, have obtained commi&s;&s;ions older in date than tho&s;e which were granted afterwards to officers their &s;uperiors before. This with many other irregularities, has been and is the cau&s;e of great unea&s;ine&s;s: and, though precedency of rank &s;o claim|ed &s;hould not be &s;upported in ju&s;tice or upon any principle,&mdash;we find all, having the lea&s;t pretext for the title, &s;trenu|ous to &s;upport it, and willing to hold a &s;uperiority. I was therefore induced to order a board of officers to take the matter under con&s;ideration. The re&s;ult, re&s;pecting the field-officers of this State, I now inclo&s;e, and wi&s;h Con|gre&s;s to adopt the regulation which the board have made, and to tran&s;mit me, by the earlie&s;t opportunity, commi&s;|&s;ions dated according to their arrangement. At the &s;ame time it may be proper that there &s;hould be a re&s;olve vacat|ing the commi&s;&s;ions they now have, and directing them to
<PB N="191" REF="029737_0529_0FE29BB960922668">
be delivered to me. Their attention to this bu&s;ine&s;s, I tru&s;t, will be immediate: the di&s;putes and jealou&s;ies with the officers require it.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed the memorial of colonel Portail and the other engineers for their promotion, referred to me by the board of war for my &s;entiments. As to the terms the&s;e gentlemen mentioned to have been propo&s;ed and agreed to when they fir&s;t arrived, I know nothing of them further than the memorial &s;tates. In re&s;pect to their abilities and knowledge in their profe&s;&s;ion, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve they have had no great opportunity of proving them &s;ince they were in our &s;ervice. However, I have rea&s;on to believe that they have been regularly bred in this important branch of war, and that their talents, which have been hitherto, as it were, dormant, want only a proper occa&s;ion to call them forth; in which ca&s;e, I have no doubt they would do them&s;elves honour and the States e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice. It is of great importance, too, to con&s;ider the practicability of replacing the&s;e gentlemen with per&s;ons equally qualified, if they &s;hould quit the &s;ervice; and how indi&s;pen&s;able men of &s;kill in this branch of military &s;cience are to every army. While I am on this &s;ubject, I would take the liberty to mention that I have been well informed that the engineer in the northern army (Corie&s;ki, I think, his name is) is a gentleman of &s;cience and merit. From the character I have had of him, he is de&s;erving of notice too.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to mention that we are in great di&s;|tre&s;s for want of money. This will be more urgent every day: and it is probable there will be a good deal of pay due to the troops coming to reinforce us. General Putnam writes pre&s;&s;ingly for a &s;upply, and &s;ays, he is in a mo&s;t di&s;|agreeable &s;ituation for want of it. I mu&s;t reque&s;t the at|tention of Congre&s;s to this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Your favour of the &s;eventh came to hand this morning. I &s;hall pay proper attention to the inclo&s;ures. The rank of the officers of cavalry I will attempt to have &s;ettled as &s;oon as circum&s;tances will admit.</P>
<P>I have nothing very intere&s;ting to communicate. The enemy have lo&s;t one of their new floating-batteries: it &s;unk in a little time after it was launched. There has been a

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE condition of the army for want of clothes and blankets, and the little pro&s;pect we have of obtaining re|lief, according to the information I have received from the board of war, occa&s;ion me to trouble you at this time. The mode of &s;eizing and forcing &s;upplies from the inhabitants, I fear, would prove very inadequate to the demands, while it would certainly embitter the minds of the people, and excite perhaps a hurtful jealou&s;y again&s;t the army. I have had officers out for the purpo&s;e of purcha&s;ing and making voluntary collections of nece&s;&s;aries: and, in a few in&s;tances, more coercive mea&s;ures have been exerci&s;ed: but all the&s;e have proved of little avail: our di&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;till continue, and are becoming greater. I would therefore humbly &s;ub|mit it to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s whether it may not be expedient for them to addre&s;s the &s;everal legi&s;lative and executive powers of the States on this &s;ubject as early as po&s;&s;ible, and in the mo&s;t urgent terms. It appears to me, if they were to appoint, under the authority of Congre&s;s, proper active agents, that many nece&s;&s;aries might be pro|cured in addition to tho&s;e [<HI>purcha&s;ed</HI>] on public account. Be&s;ides this, I think the exigency of our affairs requires that they &s;hould re&s;olve on an immediate a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment to be made on the inhabitants. If the&s;e modes were adopted, con&s;iderable aids might be derived, and in a way much le&s;s exceptionable than that of &s;eizing by the army. The a&s;|&s;emblies in many States, I believe, are now &s;itting; and I have no doubt, upon a requi&s;ition by Congre&s;s, but they will give attention to the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed you will receive a copy of a letter from general Putnam, which came to hand to-day. You will find his and governor Clinton's opinion re&s;pecting the fortifications nece&s;&s;ary to be made for the &s;ecurity of the North-river. As &s;oon as I heard that Warner's militia were coming down to reinforce me, I immediately wrote to countermand
<PB N="193" REF="029737_0531_0FE29BBAE3B3B988">
them, and directed that they &s;hould be retained to carry on the nece&s;&s;ary works during the time they are to &s;erve. My letter on this &s;ubject was on the ninth in&s;tant. As to the other troops, the propriety of bringing them here, I be|lieve, is not to be que&s;tioned. We are told through vari|ous channels that Sir Henry Clinton is coming round with all the force that can be po&s;&s;ibly &s;pared from New-York; and it is &s;aid that tho&s;e on Staten-I&s;land are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;orry to inform you that Fort-Mifflin was evacuated the night before la&s;t, after a defence which does credit to the American arms, and will ever reflect the
<PB N="194" REF="029737_0532_0FE29B3B174D1298">
highe&s;t honour upon the officers and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n of the garri&s;on. The works were entirely beat down, every piece of can|non di&s;mounted, and one of the enemy's &s;hips &s;o near that &s;he threw grenades into the fort, and killed men upon the platforms, from her tops, before they quitted the i&s;land. This &s;hip had been cut down for the purpo&s;e, and &s;o con|&s;tructed that &s;he made but a &s;mall draught of water, and by the&s;e means warped in between Fort-Mifflin and Province-I&s;land. Some complaints are made that the captains of the galleys did not &s;ufficiently exert them&s;elves to drive this ve&s;&s;el from her &s;tation: but I &s;hall not deter|mine any thing upon the matter till a proper inquiry is made.</P>
<P>Nothing in the cour&s;e of this campaign has taken up &s;o much of the attention and con&s;ideration of my&s;elf and all the general officers, as the po&s;&s;ibility of giving a further relief to Fort-Mifflin than what we had already afforded. Such a garri&s;on was thrown into it as has been found by experience capable of defending it to the la&s;t extremity: and Red-Bank, which was deemed e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, not only for the purpo&s;e of keeping open the communication, but of annoying the enemy's &s;hips and covering our own fleet, has been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a con&s;idera|ble detachment from this army. The only remaining and practicable mode of giving relief to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort was by di&s;lodging the enemy from Province-I&s;land, from whence they kept up an ince&s;&s;ant fire. But this, from the &s;itua|tion of the ground, was not to be attempted with any de|gree of &s;afety to the attacking party, without the whole or a con&s;iderable part of the army &s;hould be removed to the we&s;t &s;ide of Schuylkill to &s;upport and cover it.</P>
<P>To account for this, you mu&s;t be made acquainted with the nature of the ground. In order to have made the attack upon Province-I&s;land, the party de&s;tined for that &s;ervice, which &s;hould have been at lea&s;t fifteen hundred, mu&s;t have marched down the Che&s;ter road as far as the Bell inn near Derby, and thence, turning towards Del|aware, mu&s;t have proceeded about four miles further through a neck of land, to the i&s;land. The enemy have a bridge at the middle ferry upon Schuylkill, which is but four miles from the Bell inn: con&s;equently, by throwing a body of men over that bridge upon the fir&s;t di&s;covery of
<PB N="195" REF="029737_0533_0FE29BBC66E14EE0">
our de&s;ign, and marching down to the Bell, they would have effectually cut off our detachment upon their return. It is true the covering party might have con&s;i&s;ted of a le&s;s number than the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e army: but then tho&s;e remaining upon this &s;ide of the river would have been too few to have been entru&s;ted with all the artillery and &s;tores of the army, within twelve miles of the enemy.</P>
<P>There were many and very forcible rea&s;ons again&s;t a total remove to the we&s;t &s;ide of Schuylkill. Leaving all our &s;tores at Ea&s;ton, Bethlehem and Allentown uncov|ered, and abandoning &s;everal of our ho&s;pitals within reach of the enemy, fir&s;t pre&s;ented them&s;elves. Another, and, in my opinion, a more weighty rea&s;on than either of the preceding, was the importance of &s;upporting the po&s;t at Red-Bank, upon which that of Fort-Mifflin in a great mea&s;ure depended, as through it we &s;ent in &s;upplies of men, provi&s;ion and ammunition. The enemy, &s;en&s;ible of this, endeavoured to di&s;lodge us from Red-Bank on the twen|ty-&s;econd of la&s;t month; which, as Congre&s;s have been informed, co&s;t them four hundred men.</P>
<P>Now, had our army been on the we&s;t &s;ide of Schuylkill, they might, without any danger of an attack upon their lines, have thrown over &s;o con&s;iderable a force into Jer|&s;ey, that they might have overpowered the garri&s;on, and, by making them&s;elves ma&s;ters of it, have reduced Fort-Mifflin by famine or want of ammunition. Thus we &s;hould in all probability have lo&s;t both po&s;ts by one &s;troke. They might al&s;o, by taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fords upon Schuylkill, have rendered the junction of our northern reinforcements with us a very difficult, if not an imprac|ticable matter: and, &s;hould any accident have happened to them, we &s;hould have &s;tood a very poor chance of looking general Howe in the face through the winter with an inferior army. We &s;hould finally have thrown the ar|my into &s;uch a &s;ituation, that we mu&s;t inevitably have drawn on a general engagement before our reinforcements arrived; which, con&s;idering our di&s;parity of numbers, would probably have ended with the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable con&s;equences.</P>
<P>It was therefore determined a few days ago to wait the arrival of the reinforcement from the northward before
<PB N="196" REF="029737_0534_0FE29B3C9A4985D0">
any alteration could &s;afely be made in the di&s;po&s;ition of the army: and I was not without hopes that the fort would have held out till that time. That we might then have moved without endangering the &s;tores, I had given orders for the removal of them, from the places before mentioned, to Lebanon and other places in Lanca&s;ter county, which is at any rate more &s;afe and convenient than where they were.</P>
<P>As the keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Red-Bank, and thereby &s;till preventing the enemy from weighing the chevaux-de-fri&s;e before the fro&s;t obliges their &s;hips to quit the river, has become a matter of the greate&s;t importance, I have determined to &s;end down general St. Clair, general Knox, and baron Kalb, to take a view of the ground, and to en|deavour to form a judgment of the mo&s;t probable means of &s;ecuring it. They will at the &s;ame time &s;ee how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it is po&s;&s;ible for our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">leet to keep their &s;tation &s;ince the lo&s;s of Fort-Mifflin, and al&s;o make the proper inquiry into the conduct of the captains of the galleys, mentioned in the former part of this letter.</P>
<P>I am informed that it is matter of amazement, and that reflections have been thrown out again&s;t this army, for not being more active and enterpri&s;ing than, in the opinion of &s;ome, they ought to have been. If the charge is ju&s;t, the be&s;t way to account for it will be to refer you to the returns of our &s;trength, and tho&s;e which I can produce of the ene|my, and to the inclo&s;ed ab&s;tract of the clothing now actual|ly wanting for the army: and then I think the wonder will be, how they keep the field at all in tents at this &s;ea&s;on of the year. What &s;tock the clothier-general has to &s;up|ply this demand, or what are his pro&s;pects, he him&s;elf will inform you, as I have directed him to go to York-town to lay the&s;e matters before Congre&s;s. There are, be&s;ides, mo&s;t of tho&s;e in the ho&s;pitals more bare than tho&s;e in the field: many remain there for want of clothes only.</P>
<P>Several general officers, unable to procure clothing in the common line, have employed agents to purcha&s;e up what could be found in different parts of the country. General Wayne, among others, has employed Mr. Zantzinger of Lanca&s;ter, who has purcha&s;ed to the amount
<PB N="197" REF="029737_0535_0FE29BC7952957D8">
of four thou&s;and five hundred pounds, for which he de|&s;ires a draught upon the trea&s;ury-board. Inclo&s;ed you have a copy of his letter. I am not clear whether this application &s;hould properly be made to the trea&s;ury, or the clothier-general, who &s;hould charge the money to the regiments for whom the clothes are, as &s;o much advanced to them. If the latter &s;hould appear the mo&s;t proper mode, I will order it to be done.</P>
<P>I am anxiou&s;ly waiting the arrival of the troops from the northward, who ought, from the time they have had my orders, to have been here before this. Colonel Hamil|ton, one of my aides, is up the North-river, doing all he can to pu&s;h them forward: but he writes me word that he finds many unaccountable delays thrown in his way. However, I am in hopes that many days will not elap&s;e before a brigade or two, at lea&s;t, arrive. The want of the&s;e troops has embarra&s;&s;ed all my mea&s;ures exceedingly.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favours of the thirteenth and nineteenth in&s;tant with their inclo&s;ures. I am well a&s;&s;ured Congre&s;s have not been inattentive to the nece&s;&s;ities of the army; and that the deficiency in our &s;upplies, particularly in the article of clothing, has ari&s;en from the difficulty of importing, on account of the nume|rous fleet that line our coa&s;t. However, I am per&s;uaded that con&s;iderable relief might be drawn from the different States, were they to exert them&s;elves properly. This I hope will be the ca&s;e as &s;oon as they receive the pre&s;&s;ing recommendations of Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It has been the unvaried cu&s;tom of the enemy, from the commencement of the pre&s;ent conte&s;t, to try every artifice and device to delude the people. The me&s;&s;age through John Brown was calculated for this end. I am &s;urpri&s;ed Mr. Willing &s;hould &s;uffer him&s;elf to be impo&s;ed on by
<PB N="198" REF="029737_0536_0FE29B496C8819C8">
&s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">im&s;y mea&s;ures. He knows that there is a plain, obvious way for general and lord Howe to communicate any propo&s;als they wi&s;h to make, to Congre&s;s, without the intervention of a &s;econd and third hand. But this would not &s;uit their views. I am &s;orry that Mr. Brown &s;hould be the bearer of the me&s;&s;age; as, from the character I have had of him, he is a worthy, well-di&s;po&s;ed man. It has been frequently mentioned that he had intere&s;ted him|&s;elf much in behalf of our pri&s;oners, and had afforded them every relief and comfort his circum&s;tances would allow him to give.</P>
<P>I have been endeavouring to effect an exchange of pri&s;|oners, from principles of ju&s;tice, and from motives of hu|manity: but at pre&s;ent I have no pro&s;pect of it. Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> general Howe has a&s;&s;ured our officers it was his wi&s;h, and, if it could not be done, that he &s;hould readily agree to their relea&s;e on parole. The inclo&s;ed copies of my let|ters and his an&s;wer will &s;hew Congre&s;s what has pa&s;&s;ed between us upon that &s;ubject; and at the &s;ame time, that I had remon&s;trated again&s;t the &s;evere and cruel treatment of the pri&s;oners, and propo&s;ed the plan of &s;ending in a &s;uit|able per&s;on to inquire into the facts, before the receipt of their re&s;olution. Their &s;ufferings, I am per&s;uaded, have been great, and &s;hocking to humanity. I have called up|on general Howe for redre&s;s, and an explicit an&s;wer to my letter of the fourteenth. If I do not receive one by to-morrow night, with the mo&s;t po&s;itive and &s;atisfactory a&s;&s;urances that a proper conduct &s;hall be ob&s;erved towards them in future, we mu&s;t retaliate, however much we wi&s;h to avoid &s;everity, and mea&s;ures that bear the &s;malle&s;t ap|pearance of rigour or inhumanity.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed you will receive a li&s;t of &s;undry officers who have been ca&s;hiered &s;ince the action of the fourth ultimo. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> that the&s;e examples will involve many favourable and beneficial con&s;equences. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there were many more brought to trial, who were acquit|ted; among them, general Maxwell, and general Wayne&mdash;the former for charges again&s;t him while he command|ed the light troops,&mdash;the latter for charges again&s;t his conduct in the attack made on his divi&s;ion, in the night of the twentieth of September. The re&s;ult of the court <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="199" REF="029737_0537_0FE29BC9267598A8">

<P>I am &s;orry to inform Congre&s;s that the enemy are now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the water defences. Fort-Mifflin and that at Red-Bank mutually depended on each other for &s;upport: and the reduction of the former made the tenure of the latter extremely precarious, if not impracticable. After the lo&s;s of Fort-Mifflin, it was found Red-Bank could derive no advantages from the galleys and armed ve&s;&s;els&mdash;(they could not maintain their &s;tation)&mdash;and, in ca&s;e of inve&s;titure, the garri&s;on could have no &s;upplies, no retreat, nor any hope of relief, but &s;uch as might ari&s;e from a &s;upe|rior force acting without on the rear of the enemy, and di&s;lodging them. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the garri&s;on was obliged to evacuate it on the night of the twentieth in&s;tant, on the approach of lord Cornwallis, who had cro&s;&s;|ed the river from Che&s;ter with a detachment, &s;uppo&s;ed to be about two thou&s;and men, and formed a junction with the troops lately arrived from New-York, and tho&s;e that had been landed before at Billing&s;port.</P>
<P>From general Varnum's account, I have rea&s;on to hope that we &s;aved mo&s;t of the &s;tores, except a few heavy can|non: however, I cannot be particular in this in&s;tance. I am al&s;o to add, from the intelligence I have received, that mo&s;t if not all the armed ve&s;&s;els have been burned by our own people, except the galleys, one brig, and two &s;loops, which are &s;aid to have run by the city. How far this might be founded in nece&s;&s;ity, I am not able to determine; but I &s;uppo&s;e it was done under that idea, and an apprehen&s;ion of their falling into the enemy's hands if they attempted to pa&s;s up the river.</P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t information I had of lord Cornwallis's movement, I detached general Huntington's brigade to join general Varnum, and, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, general Greene with his divi&s;ion; hoping that the&s;e,&mdash;with Glover's brig|ade which was on the march through Jer&s;ey, and which I directed to file off to the left for the &s;ame purpo&s;e,&mdash;and with &s;uch militia as could be collected,&mdash;would be able to
<PB N="200" REF="029737_0538_0FE29D180C9B8DE8">
defeat the enemy's de&s;ign, and to pre&s;erve the fort. But they were &s;o rapid in their advances, that our troops could not form a junction and arrive in time to &s;uccour the gar|ri&s;on; which obliged them to withdraw.</P>
<P>General Greene is &s;till in Jer&s;ey; and when Glover's brigade joins him, if an attack can be made on lord Corn|wallis with a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, I am per&s;uaded it will be done. About a hundred and &s;eventy of Morgan's corps are al&s;o gone to reinforce him.</P>
<P>Generals Poor and Patter&s;on with their brigades, and colonel Bailey with Learned's, are now in camp. The la&s;t arrived on Friday evening, the other two in the cour&s;e of ye&s;terday. I have not yet obtained returns of their &s;trength; but, from the accounts of the officers, they will amount in the whole to twenty-three or twenty-four hundred rank and file. But I find many of them are very deficient in the articles of &s;hoes, &s;tockings, breeches, and blankets. Be&s;ides the&s;e, about three hundred and fifty men,&mdash;detachments from Lee's, Jack&s;on's, and Henley's regiments,&mdash;have joined me.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday evening the enemy burned &s;everal hou&s;es in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia, and they have commit|ted the mo&s;t wanton &s;poil in many others.</P>

<P>I WAS ye&s;terday morning honoured with your fa|vours of the twenty-&s;econd in&s;tant. I wi&s;h the mea&s;ures Congre&s;s have adopted may effectually &s;uppre&s;s the di&s;turb|ances in the we&s;tern department. Should they prove &s;uc|ce&s;sful, and the &s;avages and wicked deluded inhabitants re|ceive a &s;evere check, it is probable they will not be induc|ed again to take part again&s;t us, or at lea&s;t for &s;ome con&s;iderable time. Colonel Crawford &s;et out ye&s;terday evening, and will be with Congre&s;s, I expect, in the cour&s;e of two or three days to take their commands.</P>
<P>I was much obliged by the foreign intelligence you were plea&s;ed to tran&s;mit me: it is agreeable and intere&s;ting; and I heartily wi&s;h there may be an early declaration of ho&s;til|ities

between France and Britain. From the&s;e advices, things &s;eem to be getting into a proper train for it: and it is not ea&s;ily to be conceived that it can be much longer delayed. However, our expectations have not been an|&s;wered in this in&s;tance, and they may yet be held in &s;u&s;|pen&s;e. The political rea&s;ons, that lead to delay on the part of France, I do not perfectly under&s;tand. As to Britain, her honour is lo&s;t in the conte&s;t with us, and the mo&s;t indignant in&s;ults will &s;carcely be able to draw her at|tention from her pre&s;ent pur&s;uits. The account of Mr. Lee having effected the purpo&s;es of his emba&s;&s;y at the court of Berlin is of great importance. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be true. In &s;uch ca&s;e, admini&s;tration, however de&s;irous they may be, will probably be di&s;appointed in their &s;chemes of further mer|cenary aids again&s;t us.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t take the liberty to reque&s;t the deci&s;ion of Con|gre&s;s on the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the nine fir&s;t-rai&s;ed Virginia regiments as early as circum&s;tances will permit. If the plan propo&s;ed for re-enli&s;ting them is judged expedient, one capital in|ducement to that end, &s;ugge&s;ted by the officers, will cea&s;e if it is longer delayed. It is a matter of con&s;iderable im|portance, and of which I wi&s;h to be &s;atisfied as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible. I &s;hould al&s;o be happy in their determination re|&s;pecting the marquis De la Fayette. He is more and more &s;olicitous to be in actual &s;ervice, and is pre&s;&s;ing in his appli|cations for a command. I ventured before to &s;ubmit my &s;entiments upon the mea&s;ure; and I &s;till fear a refu&s;al will not only induce him to return in di&s;gu&s;t, but may involve &s;ome unfavourable con&s;equences. There are now &s;ome vacant divi&s;ions in the army, to one of which he may be appointed, if it &s;hould be the plea&s;ure of Congre&s;s. I am convinced he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a large &s;hare of that military ardour which generally characterizes the nobility of his country. He went to Jer&s;ey with general Greene, and I find he has not been inactive there. This you will perceive by the following extract from a letter ju&s;t received from general Greene.</P>
<P>"The marquis, with about four hundred militia and the rifle corps, attacked the enemy's piquet la&s;t evening, killed about twenty, wounded many more, and took about twenty pri&s;oners. The marquis is charmed with the &s;pirited

behaviour of the militia and rifle corps: they drove the en|emy about half a mile, and kept the ground until dark. The enemy's piquet con&s;i&s;ted of about three hundred, and were reinforced during the &s;kirmi&s;h. The marquis is de|termined to be in the way of danger."</P>

I am in hopes the treatment of ours will be much better in future. Mr. Boudinot will immediately take mea&s;ures for relea&s;ing the officers on parole, that we may relieve an equal number of ours.

At pre&s;ent it is truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing: and, unle&s;s &s;ome means can be devi&s;ed to &s;upport them more comfortably, we &s;hall have to appre|hend the mo&s;t alarming con&s;equences. The officers, or at lea&s;t a large proportion of them, as well as the men, are in a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable condition as to clothing, and without any certain pro&s;pect of relief: and, what is &s;till more pain|ful,&mdash;if perchance they have an opportunity of purcha&s;ing, (which is &s;eldom the ca&s;e) they have the mortification to find them&s;elves totally incompetent to it, from the depre|ciation of our money, and the exorbitant prices demanded for all articles in this way. This is the &s;ource of great unea&s;ine&s;s, of indifference to the &s;ervice, and of repeated (I may &s;ay, daily) applications to leave it, and the&s;e too by as good officers as are in the American line.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to promotions for merit and intrepidity, I would beg leave to ob&s;erve, that, though the&s;e are proper con&s;iderations to found them upon, yet they &s;hould be made with the greate&s;t caution and attention, and only in ca&s;es of the mo&s;t eminent and di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ervices. Every pro|motion or ri&s;e out of common cour&s;e cannot fail to excite unea&s;ine&s;s in a greater or le&s;&s;er degree: and nothing will reconcile them to the army at large, and particularly the officers more immediately affected by them, but where the cau&s;es are known and acknowledged. This I mention from my wi&s;hes to promote the public intere&s;t, from my knowing that harmony is e&s;&s;ential to this end, and from no other motives whatever.</P>
<P>Before the receipt of your favour, I do not recollect to have heard of John Simper's ca&s;e. His brother has not been with me. As &s;oon as he arrives, I &s;hall give direc|tions for him to be relea&s;ed from his pre&s;ent confinement, and to be forwarded to Cecil county.</P>
<P>I have nothing material to inform you of. Lord Corn|wallis and the detachment under his command (mentioned in my la&s;t) returned from Jer&s;ey on Thur&s;day. We had rea&s;on to expect an attack &s;ince, from our advices from the city, but have been di&s;appointed.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour to inform you, that, in the cour&s;e of la&s;t week, from a variety of intelligence, I had rea&s;on to expect that general Howe was preparing to give us a general action. Accordingly, on Thur&s;day night he moved from the city with all his force, except a very in|con&s;iderable part left in his lines and redoubts,&mdash;and ap|peared the next morning on Che&s;nut-hill, in front of, and about three miles di&s;tant from, our right wing. As &s;oon as their po&s;ition was di&s;covered, the Penn&s;ylvania militia were ordered from our right, to &s;kirmi&s;h with their light advanced parties; and I am &s;orry to mention that briga|dier-general Irvine who led them on had the misfortune to be wounded and to be made pri&s;oner. Nothing more oc|cured on that day.</P>
<P>On Friday night the enemy changed their ground, and moved to our left, within a mile of our line, where they remained quiet and advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted the whole of the next day. On Sunday they inclined &s;till further to our left; and, from every appearance, there was rea&s;on to ap|prehend they were determined on an action. In this movement, their advanced and flanking parties were warm|ly attacked by colonel Morgan and his corps, and al&s;o by the Maryland militia under colonel Gi&s;t. Their lo&s;s I cannot a&s;certain: but I am informed it was con&s;iderable, having regard to the number of the corps who engaged them. About &s;un&s;et, after various marches and counter|marches, they halted; and I &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed, from their di&s;|po&s;ition and preceding manoeuvres, that they would attack us in the night or early the next morning: but in this I was mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>On Monday afternoon they began to move again, and, in&s;tead of advancing, filed off from their right: and the fir&s;t certain account that I could obtain of their intentions was, that they were in full march towards Philadelphia by two or three routes. I immediately detached light parties after them to fall upon their rear: but they were not able to come up with them.</P>
<P>The enemy's lo&s;s, as I have ob&s;erved, I cannot a&s;cer|tain. One account from the city is that five hundred
<PB N="205" REF="029737_0543_0FE29C25AEF83B20">
wounded had been &s;ent in: another is that eighty-two waggons had gone in with men in this &s;ituation. The&s;e, I fear, are both exaggerated, and not to be depended upon. We lo&s;t twenty-&s;even men in Morgan's corps, killed and wounded, be&s;ides major Morris, a brave and gallant officer, who is among the latter. Of the Maryland militia there were al&s;o &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen wounded. I have not re|ceived further returns yet.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely wi&s;h that they had made an attack, as the i&s;&s;ue, in all probability, from the di&s;po&s;ition of our troops, and the &s;trong &s;ituation of our camp, would have been for|tunate and happy. At the &s;ame time I mu&s;t add, that rea&s;on, prudence, and every principle of policy, forbad us quitting our po&s;t to attack them. Nothing but &s;ucce&s;s would have ju&s;tified the mea&s;ure: and this could not be expected from their po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The con&s;tant attention and watching I was obliged to give the enemy's movements would not allow me to write before: and this I believe was the le&s;s material, as I have rea&s;on to think your committee who were in camp mo&s;t of the time, and who are now here, tran&s;mitted an account of &s;uch occurrences as they deemed important in any degree. The fir&s;t cau&s;e too, Sir, and my engagements with the committee previous to the coming out of the enemy, will, I tru&s;t, &s;ufficiently apologize for my not acknowledging be|fore the honour of your favours of the thirtieth ultimo and the fir&s;t in&s;tant, which came to hand in due order and time.</P>

I tru&s;t they will be vigorous, or the army cannot exi&s;t. It will never an&s;wer, to procure &s;upplies of clothing or provi&s;ion by coercive mea&s;ures:&mdash;the &s;mall &s;eizures made of the former a few days ago in con&s;equence of the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing and ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity,&mdash;when that, or to di&s;&s;olve, was the alternative,&mdash;excited the greate&s;t alarm and unea&s;ine&s;s even among our be&s;t and warme&s;t friends. Such procedures may give a momentary relief; but, if repeated, will prove of the mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equence. Be&s;ides &s;preading di&s;affection, jealou&s;y, and fear in the people, they never fail, even in the mo&s;t veteran troops under the mo&s;t rigid and exact di&s;cipline, to rai&s;e in the &s;olidery a di&s;po&s;ition to licentiou&s;ne&s;s, to plunder and robbery,&mdash;difficult to &s;up|pre&s;s afterwards, and which has proved not only ruinous to the inhabitants, but, in many in&s;tances, to armies them|&s;elves. I regret the occa&s;ion that compelled us to the mea&s;ure the other day; and &s;hall con&s;ider it among the greate&s;t of our misfortunes, if we &s;hould be under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of practi&s;ing it again.</P>

<P>I YESTERDAY evening had the honour to re|ceive your favour of the fifth in&s;tant, with its inclo&s;ures.&mdash;The power Congre&s;s have been plea&s;ed to ve&s;t me with, for appointing aides-de-camp, I &s;hall u&s;e with economy, and I will not appoint more at any time than &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential to advance the public intere&s;t. Any future appointments that may be material will be made out of the line of the army, if circum&s;tances will allow it. In gen|eral this has been the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The proceedings of Congre&s;s for the detention of gen|eral Burgoyne and army, or rather &s;u&s;pending their em|barkation, till the convention of Saratoga is explicitly ratified and notified by the court of Britain, &s;hall re|main &s;ecret here till they are duly announced by Con|gre&s;s. This procedure, when known to the general, will chagrin him much: for I learn by a letter from general Heath, that the refu&s;al to let his troops embark at Rhode-I&s;land or in the Sound had given him &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s. I have nothing of importance to communicate; and have only to add that</P>

<P>P. S. The great diver&s;ity of opinions prevailing, as to the operation which the re&s;olves of the thirtieth ultimo and fir&s;t in&s;tant &s;hould have, which give a month's extra pay, makes it nece&s;&s;ary for me to reque&s;t Congre&s;s to de&s;cribe with certainty and preci&s;ion the per&s;ons whom they intend|ed &s;hould be the particular objects of their benevolence.
<PB N="208" REF="029737_0546_0FE29BD4945D9F80">
Without this, I am certain I &s;hall not be able to execute the re&s;olves according to their intention, and in a manner that will be agreeable to the army.</P>
<P>If &s;uch officers and men as were in camp when the re|&s;olves were pa&s;&s;ed, and who continue the whole winter, are the only objects to be benefited, it is urged that many who have di&s;charged their duty with fidelity,&mdash;who have ex|perienced a &s;evere campaign to that time or till a few days before,&mdash;who may be now out of camp, and yet be here in the cour&s;e of the winter,&mdash;will be excluded. For ex|ample, all officers and men on furlough, though they &s;hould have been long from their homes before,&mdash;perhaps much longer, in many in&s;tances, than many who remain,&mdash;and who&s;e private and family nece&s;&s;ities oblige them to be ab|&s;ent,&mdash;tho&s;e who have fallen &s;ick from their &s;ervices, and who are in ho&s;pitals or the country,&mdash;detachments on com|mand,&mdash;the&s;e would be excluded. Such di&s;criminations, I believe, will give great di&s;gu&s;t and unea&s;ine&s;s. It is dif|ficult, in ca&s;es of this nature, to draw a proper line of di&s;|tinction, and impo&s;&s;ible to do it in &s;uch a way as to give &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>I do not mean to enlarge upon the &s;ubject: my only wi&s;h is to have it preci&s;ely a&s;certained who are to be in|cluded and paid, and who are not, under the re&s;olves, that I may not on the one hand act contrary to public inten|tion, and on the other give cau&s;e of complaint, and perhaps do wrong to individuals.</P>
<P>Knowing the difficulty of drawing a proper line, and the di&s;gu&s;t and murmurings that ever attend di&s;crimina|tions,&mdash;were I to advi&s;e upon the &s;ubject, only &s;uch officers and men &s;hould be excluded (&s;ince extra pay has been de|termined on) as are ab&s;ent from camp without regular authority, or &s;uch as may abu&s;e indulgencies regularly obtained.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved by &s;ome, and perhaps with pro|priety, that there are officers and men now in camp, or who may be &s;hortly in, who have no &s;uperior claim to merit,&mdash;who&s;e affairs are not &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, or who have al|ready had indulgencies,&mdash;or who, from their being nearer their friends and connexions, have had opportunities of &s;eeing them frequently, of ordering their concerns, and

vi&s;iting their homes once, twice, or perhaps oftener in the campaign, whil&s;t they who were more remote were precluded from any of the&s;e advantages, and were con&s;tantly on duty. The&s;e con&s;iderations will have their weight in the &s;cale of di&s;gu&s;t with the parties intere&s;ted. For my part, though the re&s;olves were founded in principles of genero&s;ity,&mdash;were intended to reward merit, and promote the &s;ervice,&mdash;from the difficulties attending the execution, I wi&s;h they had never been made, e&s;pecially as I believe officers and men would in a little time have become tolerably well rec|onciled to their quarters.</P>

<P N="4">4. If there is to be a di&s;tinction between &s;tationary and other detachments,&mdash;and the former are denied an exclu&s;ive right to the captures they make,&mdash;what propor|tion of the articles are they to have?</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="029737_0548_0FE29BD767487520">
I have been induced to &s;tate the above que&s;tions on ac|count of &s;ome difficulties that have ari&s;en re&s;pecting the prize taken by the detachment at Wilmington under gen|eral Smallwood, that the &s;ame may be determined, and certain principles e&s;tabli&s;hed, to govern in like and future ca&s;es.

<P>THIS will be delivered to you by the chevalier De Mauduit du Ple&s;&s;is, who was among the fir&s;t French officers that joined the army of the United States. The gallant conduct of this young gentleman at Brandywine, German|town, and his di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ervices at Fort-Mercer where he united the offices of engineer and commandant of artil|lery, entitle him to the particular notice of Congre&s;s. He made &s;everal judicious alterations in the works at Red-Bank, &s;hewed great good conduct during the action in which the He&s;&s;ians were repul&s;ed, and was &s;poken of, in con&s;e|quence, in terms of the highe&s;t applau&s;e, by the command|ing officer of the po&s;t.

<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favour of the third in&s;tant, and with its inclo&s;ure.</P>
<P>As general M^cDougal's late &s;evere illne&s;s and pre&s;ent feeble &s;tate will not permit him to proceed on the intended excur&s;ion into Canada, baron De Kal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> will follow the marquis agreeable to his wi&s;h and the direction of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>According to the promi&s;e contained in my la&s;t, I take the liberty of tran&s;mitting you copies of &s;uch letters as have lately pa&s;&s;ed between general Howe and my&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 12. Since writing the above, I have received another letter from general Howe, of the fifth in&s;tant, a copy of which, and of my an&s;wer, you have al&s;o inclo&s;ed. By the&s;e you will perceive that he has propo&s;ed a general exchange of pri&s;oners, and that I have acceded to it. I have written to Mr. Boudinot, commi&s;&s;ary in this line, re|quiring his return to camp; and &s;hall give him direction<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to pur&s;ue the mo&s;t &s;peedy mea&s;ures for accompli&s;hing this bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o intere&s;ting to the unhappy officers and men in general Howe's hands, and to the cau&s;e of humanity. There are &s;ome other matters, as you will di&s;cover, which I could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the affairs of the army has not till lately made it convenient to go into the inquiry directed by the re&s;olve of the twenty-eighth of November, of the lo&s;&s;es of the Forts Montgomery and Clinton in the State of New-York, and of Fort-Mifflin on Delaware. With re&s;pect to the two former, it happens that almo&s;t all the principal officers acting in that quarter were in &s;ome way or other &s;o far concerned in the affair, as to make them improper for pro&s;ecuting the inquiry. I therefore propo&s;e to &s;end officers from this army. If his health will permit, I &s;hould wi&s;h general M^cDougal to pre&s;ide. His thorough knowledge of tho&s;e po&s;ts and all their connexions qualifies him in a peculiar manner for the purpo&s;e. I have written to him on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Fort-Mifflin, the inquiry involves very exten&s;ive con&s;iderations, and, more or le&s;s, affects almo&s;t all the general officers in this army, who&s;e advice and con|currence in the mea&s;ures taken make them in &s;ome degree

parties. The mode, in my opinion, mo&s;t unexceptionable to be pur&s;ued, is for Congre&s;s to authori&s;e a committee of their own body, or to delegate any other per&s;ons they may choo&s;e to entru&s;t, not connected with the operations of this army, to go into the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 14. Your &s;everal favours of the &s;eventh, and that of the eighth in&s;tant, were duly received ye&s;terday evening. As &s;oon as circum&s;tances will admit, I &s;hall appoint a court-martial in the ca&s;e directed, and &s;hall no|tify the parties concerned of the &s;ame. The oath, which Congre&s;s have pre&s;cribed to be taken by the officers of the army, I &s;hall publi&s;h in general orders, and the mode how it is to be done, with directions about the certificates. I &s;hall extend colonel Dyer's furlough to the fir&s;t of April, as required.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to acknowledge the honour of your &s;ev|eral favours of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-fir&s;t in&s;tant, which, with their re&s;pective inclo&s;ures, have been duly received.</P>
<P>In compliance with the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s of the fifth in&s;tant, tran&s;mitted in your letter of the &s;eventh, I was about to take mea&s;ures for appointing a court-martial and bringing on the trials which they direct. But on recur|ring to the papers you were plea&s;ed to &s;end me, I do not find that the committee have made any particular charges again&s;t the officers who are to be the objects of trial. It was probably the intention of Congre&s;s that the&s;e charges &s;hould be laid by me. But as I might err in doing it, and not fully corre&s;pond with their views in the matter, e&s;pecially as it would require con&s;iderable time and thought to make my&s;elf &s;ufficiently acquainted with it from the pa|pers collected, I &s;hould think it would be mo&s;t advi&s;eable for Congre&s;s to &s;tate explicitly the charges they wi&s;h to have exhibited again&s;t the officers re&s;pectively; and then the bu&s;ine&s;s may be proceeded on with propriety.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="029737_0553_0FE29C406DBD4E08">
Be&s;ides the above rea&s;ons which operate generally again&s;t my exhibiting the charges, in the particular in&s;tance of general Schuyler, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to do it, as I do not know what in&s;tructions he had received from Congre&s;s from time to time as to the objects of his command, nor preci&s;ely what the&s;e were. The&s;e appear to me nece&s;&s;ary to be known, and e&s;&s;ential to carry on a pro&s;ecution again&s;t him.</P>
<P>When Congre&s;s &s;hall have arranged the&s;e points, and are plea&s;ed to honour me with them, I will pur&s;ue the &s;peedie&s;t mea&s;ures to bring on the trials. The &s;ooner this can be done, the better, as &s;ome of the parties are extreme|ly anxious, and &s;trongly importune it.</P>
<P>Baron Steuben has arrived at camp. He appears to be much of a gentleman, and, as far as I have had an oppor|tunity of judging, a man of military knowledge, and ac|quainted with the world.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed extract of a letter from general Putnam will &s;hew how great the di&s;tre&s;&s;es are in that quarter for want of money. He has de&s;cribed their nece&s;&s;ities &s;o ful|ly, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to add upon the &s;ubject: I &s;hall only ob&s;erve that his account is more than ju&s;tified by many other letters, and that I am per&s;uaded the earlie&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;upply will be forwarded, that the very important and intere&s;ting works carrying on there may not be the lea&s;t retarded.</P>
<P>I am under &s;ome embarra&s;&s;ments re&s;pecting the thir|teenth Virginia regiment. It was rai&s;ed on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Allegany and towards Pitt&s;burg, with a&s;&s;urances from the officers, it is &s;aid, that the men &s;hould not be drawn from that quarter. This circum&s;tance, added to the di&s;turbances by the Indians, and the expo&s;ed &s;ituation of their families, has been the cau&s;e of great de&s;ertions, and is at pre&s;ent the &s;ource of much unea&s;ine&s;s, and the more &s;o, as part of the regiment was never marched from thence. I think the whole &s;hould be united either here or there, and wi&s;h Congre&s;s to direct me upon the &s;ubject. At the &s;ame time that their ca&s;e, if truly repre&s;ented, &s;eems to be hard, and to merit the indulgence they claim, I would ob&s;erve that the twelfth regiment from the we&s;t|ern parts of the &s;ame State, and the eighth and twelfth

Penn&s;ylvania from the frontier counties of this, have &s;imilar preten&s;ions, and might become unea&s;y, and apply for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> indulgence.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the directions of Congre&s;s, I &s;hall &s;end a major-general to Rhode-I&s;land, though the number of offi|cers here of this rank, from one cau&s;e and another, is greatly reduced, and more &s;o than it ought to be in point of policy.</P>
<P>Our lo&s;s of matro&s;&s;es, the la&s;t campaign, in killed and wounded, was con&s;iderable; and it has not been a little increa&s;ed this winter by de&s;ertions from colonel Proctor's corps. From the&s;e circum&s;tances, we are very weak in this line; and I reque&s;t that Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to order colonel Harri&s;on's regiment of artillery to march from Virginia as early as the roads will admit, and join this army.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE the liberty of tran&s;mitting you copies of three letters from general Howe, of the fourteenth and twenty-fir&s;t ultimo, and of the &s;econd in&s;tant, with their inclo&s;ures. The unhappy violation of the flag of truce has laid us under no &s;mall embarra&s;&s;ments, and has afford|ed the enemy good grounds for complaint and triumph at the &s;ame time. This however is the natural con&s;equence, and mu&s;t ever be the ca&s;e, where different powers counter|act each other in matters of the mo&s;t delicate importance. There are &s;ome circum&s;tances attending this affair, which it may po&s;&s;ibly be in the power of Congre&s;s to throw light upon. If they can, I &s;hall be obliged by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 8. In con&s;equence of the letters which have lately pa&s;&s;ed between general Howe and my&s;elf, particu|larly tho&s;e of the fifth and tenth ultimo, copies of which I had the honour to tran&s;mit you in mine of the eighth, continued to the fourteenth, I was about to &s;end com|mi&s;&s;ioners to meet tho&s;e appointed by general Howe for adju&s;ting the di&s;puted points between us, carrying into ex|ecution an exchange of pri&s;oners, and improving the old
<PB N="217" REF="029737_0555_0FE29C41F02D6B78">
cartel, as far as it might be practicable, for their better ac|commodation in future. This meeting was to be on the tenth in&s;tant: but, ye&s;terday morning, Dunlap's paper of the fourth being put into my hands, I found that a re&s;o|lution had been made the twenty-&s;ixth of February, calling for all accounts again&s;t pri&s;oners in our hands, and declar|ing that no exchange &s;hould take place, till the balance due thereon to the United States is di&s;charged. Some of the States are not required to exhibit their claims till the fir&s;t of June. The time that would be taken to adju&s;t them, and make a delivery of the pri&s;oners, would more than exhau&s;t all the en&s;uing &s;ummer.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution I cannot con&s;ider as an intended infrac|tion of my engagements with general Howe: yet its op|eration is diametrically oppo&s;ite both to the &s;pirit and letter of the propo&s;itions made on my part, and acceded to on his. I &s;uppo&s;ed my&s;elf fully authori&s;ed "by the in&s;truc|tions and intentions" of Congre&s;s to act as I did: and I now conceive that the public as well as my own per&s;onal honour and faith are pledged for the performance.</P>
<P>By the direction of Congre&s;s, I in the fir&s;t in&s;tance &s;tipulated with general Howe an exchange of pri&s;oners,&mdash;officer for officer, of equal rank,&mdash;&s;oldier for &s;oldier,&mdash;and citizen for citizen. This agreement they have ever approved, and repeatedly declared their willingne&s;s to carry into execution. Their re&s;olution of the twenty-fourth of March la&s;t empowered me (on condition of general Lee being declared exchangeable) not only <HI>"to proceed"</HI> to the exchange of pri&s;oners according to the principles and regulations of the cartel before agreed on, but al&s;o to enter, into &s;uch further principles and regulations as &s;hould ap|pear to me mo&s;t proper and advantageous. A &s;ub&s;equent re&s;olution of the &s;ixth of June holds forth the &s;ame lan|guage, &s;anctions my conduct and rea&s;onings in the nego|ciations about that time on the &s;ubject, and directs an ad|herence to them. No event has occurred &s;ince that period, by which I could conclude there was any alteration in the views of Congre&s;s:&mdash;&s;o far from it, that all my late let|ters breathing the &s;ame &s;pirit with the former, and pointedly &s;ignifying my wi&s;h to bring about a general exchange, if not with an expre&s;s, at lea&s;t met with a tacit approbation.
<PB N="218" REF="029737_0556_0FE29BE577307AA0">
General Howe at length, by profe&s;&s;ion, if not in reality, is willing to perform the agreement on the conditions re|quired by me, and confirmed by them.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that, with whatever powers I was orig|inally ve&s;ted to negociate an exchange, the re&s;olution of the nineteenth of December la&s;t was an abridgment of them, &s;o far as to annex a new condition,&mdash;the &s;ettlement and payment of accounts previous to its taking place. I had no conception of this being the ca&s;e in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance, however the letter may warrant the con&s;truction. Be&s;ides the common principle of preventing the inconven|iences nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ulting from allowing the enemy to make their payments in paper currency, I had rea&s;on to imagine that general Burgoyne's army was more particularly the object of the concluding clau&s;e. This interpretation I the more readily adopted; for, exclu&s;ive of the affairs of that army, I verily believed, that, from the confu&s;ed defective &s;tate of our accounts relating to pri&s;oners, there would be a con&s;iderable balance in favour of Mr. Howe. Nor was the &s;ituation of our accounts the only rea&s;on for this belief: the pri&s;oners in our hands, e&s;pecially tho&s;e we&s;tward of the Delaware, as I am informed, have been in a great mea&s;ure &s;upported by their own labour, and at the expen&s;e of the enemy, who have had agents con&s;tantly among us. If this is the ca&s;e, the rea&s;on of the re&s;olve not applying, the effect ought not of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But perhaps it may be thought contrary to our intere&s;t to go into an exchange, as the enemy would derive more immediate advantage from it than we &s;hould. This I &s;hall not deny: but it appeared to me, that, on principles of genuine, exten&s;ive policy, independent of the con&s;iderations of compa&s;&s;ion and ju&s;tice, we were under an obligation not to elude it. I have the be&s;t evidence that an event of this kind is the general wi&s;h of the country: I know it to be the wi&s;h of the army; and no one can doubt that it is the ardent wi&s;h of the unhappy &s;ufferers them&s;elves. We need only con&s;ult the tide of humanity, and the &s;ympathies natural to tho&s;e connected by the cements of blood, inter|e&s;t, and a common dread of evil, to be convinced that the prevailing current of &s;entiment demands an exchange. If the country, the army, and even the pri&s;oners them&s;elves,
<PB N="219" REF="029737_0557_0FE29C4372166340">
had a preci&s;e idea of our circum&s;tances, and could be fully &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;advantages that might attend the giving our enemy a con&s;iderable reinforcement without having an equivalent, they might perhaps be willing to make a &s;acri|fice of their feelings to the motives of policy. But they have not this knowledge, and cannot be entru&s;ted with it; and their rea&s;onings, of nece&s;&s;ity, will be governed by what they feel.</P>
<P>Were an opinion once to be e&s;tabli&s;hed (and the enemy and their emi&s;&s;aries know very well how to inculcate it, if they are furni&s;hed with a plau&s;ible pretext) that we de|&s;ignedly avoided an exchange, it would be a cau&s;e of di&s;|&s;atisfaction and di&s;gu&s;t to the country and to the army,&mdash;of re&s;entment and de&s;peration to our captive officers and &s;ol|diers: to &s;ay nothing of the importance of not hazarding our national character but upon the mo&s;t &s;olid grounds, e&s;|pecially in our embryo &s;tate, from the influence it may have on our affairs abroad; it may not be a little dangerous to beget in the minds of our own countrymen a &s;u&s;picion that we do not pay the &s;tricte&s;t ob&s;ervance to the maxims of honour and good faith.</P>
<P>It is prudent to u&s;e the greate&s;t caution not to &s;hock the notions of general ju&s;tice and humanity, univer&s;al among mankind, as well in a public as a private view. In a bu&s;i|ne&s;s on the &s;ide of which the pa&s;&s;ions are &s;o much con|cerned as in the pre&s;ent, men would be readily di&s;po&s;ed to believe the wor&s;t, and cheri&s;h the mo&s;t unfavourable con|clu&s;ions. Were the letters that have pa&s;&s;ed between gen|eral Howe and my&s;elf from fir&s;t to la&s;t, and the proceed|ings of Congre&s;s on the &s;ame &s;ubject, to be publi&s;hed with proper comments, it is much to be feared, if the exchange &s;hould be deferred till the terms of the la&s;t re&s;olve were fulfilled, that it would be difficult to prevent our being generally accu&s;ed with a breach of good faith. Perhaps it might be &s;aid, that, while the enemy refu&s;ed us ju&s;tice, we fondly embraced the opportunity to be loud, per&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ering, ince&s;&s;ant in our claims; but the moment they were willing to render it, we receded from our&s;elves, and &s;tarted new difficulties. This, I &s;ay, might be the rea&s;oning of &s;pec|ulative minds; and they might con&s;ider all our profe&s;&s;ions
<PB N="220" REF="029737_0558_0FE29BE6F8F417E8">
as <HI>mere</HI> profe&s;&s;ions; or, at be&s;t, that intere&s;t and policy were to be the only arbiters of their validity.</P>
<P>Imputations of this nature would have a tendency to unnerve our operations, by dimini&s;hing that re&s;pect and confidence which are e&s;&s;ential to be placed in tho&s;e who are at the head of affairs either in the civil or military line. This, added to the pro&s;pect of hopele&s;s captivity, would be a great di&s;couragement to the &s;ervice. The ill con&s;e|quences of both would be immen&s;e,&mdash;by increa&s;ing the cau&s;es of di&s;content in the army, which are already too numerous, and many of which are in a great mea&s;ure un|avoidable,&mdash;by fortifying that unwillingne&s;s which already appears too great, towards entering into the &s;ervice, and of cour&s;e impeding the progre&s;s both of draughting and re|cruiting,&mdash;by dejecting the courage of the &s;oldiery, from an apprehen&s;ion of the horrors of captivity,&mdash;and finally by reducing tho&s;e, who&s;e lot it is to drink the bitter cup, to a de&s;pair which can only find relief by renouncing their attachments and engaging with their captors. The&s;e ef|fects have already been experienced in part from the ob&s;ta|cles that have lain in the way of exchanges: but if the&s;e ob&s;tacles were once to &s;eem the re&s;ult of &s;y&s;tem, they would become ten-fold. Nothing has operated more di&s;|agreeably upon the minds of the militia than the fear of captivity, on the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ting it has hitherto &s;tood. What would be their rea&s;onings, if it &s;hould be thought to &s;tand-upon a wor&s;e?</P>
<P>If a pre&s;ent temporary intere&s;t is to be a ruling principle, it is ea&s;y to prove that an exchange can never take place. The con&s;titution of our army in re&s;pect to the term of &s;ervice for which our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> engage, and the dependence we are obliged to place on the militia, mu&s;t forever operate again&s;t us in exchanges, and forbid an equality of advantages. Should it be &s;aid that there are times when it might be more peculiarly unequal and injurious, and that the pre&s;ent is &s;uch on account of the week condition of our army,&mdash;I an&s;wer that the delay nece&s;&s;arily involved in the previous negocia|tion on the &s;ubject, in delivering the pri&s;oners from time to time in &s;mall numbers and receiving others in their &s;tead, and the mode of delivery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> different places, will nearly bring the matter to the point we could wi&s;h, and give us
<PB N="221" REF="029737_0559_0FE29C44F7A986E8">
lei&s;ure to reinforce this army, (if it is to be done at all) &s;o as to obviate in a great mea&s;ure the ill con&s;equences apprehended.</P>
<P>But if the argument of intere&s;t on a partial &s;cale be pur|&s;ued as far as it will go, not only the general con&s;ideration thrown out above, but &s;pecial ones appo&s;ite to every &s;itua|tion, will pre&s;ent them&s;elves, that we ought not to exchange: now we ought not, becau&s;e our army is weak!&mdash;when the &s;ea&s;on is more advanced, and it is time for the campaign to open, we ought not, becau&s;e our army may be &s;trong, and it will be our bu&s;ine&s;s to avail our&s;elves of our own &s;trength and the enemy's weakne&s;s, to &s;trike &s;ome deci&s;ive blow!&mdash;if they, by the protection of their &s;hipping and impregnable works, &s;hould be able to baffle our attempts till the period of reinforcements from Europe arrive, it will &s;urely then not be our intere&s;t to add numbers and &s;trength to an enemy already &s;ufficiently numerous and &s;trong!&mdash;Thus, by a par|ity of rea&s;oning, the golden era will never come, which is to relieve the mi&s;eries of captivity. Our &s;ervice mu&s;t be|come odious: tho&s;e who are out of it will endeavour to keep &s;o; and tho&s;e who are in it will wi&s;h to get out of it: every pri&s;oner the enemy makes will be his &s;oldier rather than &s;ubmit to a rigorous and de&s;pairing confinement.</P>
<P>If we do not &s;eize the pre&s;ent propitious moment when the nece&s;&s;ities of the enemy pre&s;s them to rea&s;onable terms, to form and e&s;tabli&s;h a liberal cartel, it is not impo&s;&s;ible, in the vici&s;&s;itudes and rever&s;es of war, that a time may come when we &s;hould wi&s;h we had embraced it, and intere&s;t may &s;trongly impel the enemy to decline it, except on the mo&s;t unequal conditions. True policy, as well as good faith, in my opinion, binds us to improve the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>There are however &s;ome ambiguities in general Howe's conduct, which require explanation, and ought to put us upon our guard. I determined to make the affair of citi|zens,&mdash;viz. to procure an exemption from captivity for them, if po&s;&s;ible,&mdash;or, if not, (&s;ince it cannot now be de|manded as a matter of right) to fix their exchangeability upon the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t unequivocal foundation,&mdash;an in|di&s;pen&s;able preliminary to any further procedure; and at the &s;ame time to &s;ecure the exchange of general Lee and all
<PB N="222" REF="029737_0560_0FE29BE87AE871C0">
other officers who have been the particular objects of exception.</P>
<P>The interview intended between general Howe's com|mi&s;&s;ioners and tho&s;e on our part on the tenth in&s;tant is now po&s;tponed. I cannot doubt that Congre&s;s, in pre&s;ervation of the public faith and my per&s;onal honour, will remove all impediments that now oppo&s;e them&s;elves to my engagements, and that they will authori&s;e me, through commi&s;&s;ioners ap|pointed for the purpo&s;e, to negociate a more exten&s;ive and competent cartel, upon &s;uch principles as may appear ad|vantageous and founded in nece&s;&s;ity,&mdash;any re&s;olutions here|tofore to the contrary notwith&s;tanding; and I mu&s;t reque&s;t that they will favour me with their an&s;wer by the earlie&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>The work, from its nature, will be difficult. Two par|ties are concerned, who&s;e intere&s;ts are more than oppo&s;ite in a common view. We &s;hall endeavour to act for the be&s;t, and to promote the public &s;ervice as far as po&s;&s;ible, though we may not be able to an&s;wer the expectations of all. But it &s;hould be remembered, that, although general Howe's want of men affords a pro&s;pect of favourable terms, yet he will not be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;acrifice to it all con&s;iderations of general advantage in a contract of &s;uch a nature; and it is not even to be hoped that it can take place except on princi|ples of mutual benefit.</P>
<P>I per&s;uade my&s;elf that the freedom I have taken in de|livering my &s;entiments &s;o fully upon this occa&s;ion will rea|dily be excu&s;ed, as it proceeds from a de&s;ire to place the motives of my conduct in a ju&s;t point of view, and from an opinion of duty that led me to a free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a &s;ubject, which, con&s;idered in all its lights, will appear to compre|hend con&s;equences of the fir&s;t delicacy and magnitude.</P>

<P>I HAVE been this day favoured with yours of the twenty-&s;eventh of February, and of the &s;econd, third, and fourth in&s;tant, which I &s;hall an&s;wer in their order.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="029737_0561_0FE29C4F65D64B68">
The removal of &s;o valuable a train of field artillery from. Albany to Farmington, as to a place of greater &s;ecurity, was certainly a mea&s;ure highly proper; and you may be a&s;&s;ured that every precaution &s;hall be taken to e&s;cort them &s;afely through Jer&s;ey to this camp, when it is thought ad|vi&s;eable to bring them hither.</P>
<P>You mi&s;took the intent of mine of the eighteenth of February. I did not mean to give you the trouble of mak|ing a return of the Briti&s;h officers who were exchanged af|ter the convention. General R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ide&s;el, as I informed you, wrote to me to obtain liberty for him to make an exchange of &s;ome of his &s;uit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and other foreign officers, as that liber|ty had been allowed to the Briti&s;h. I did not choo&s;e to give him any an&s;wer until I had applied to you, that I might know whether you had any rea&s;on for making &s;uch di&s;tinction: and as you mi&s;apprehended me, I &s;hall &s;till be obliged to defer an&s;wering him till I hear from you. I think, con&s;idering the great number of officers of ours who are in captivity, it is our intere&s;t to exchange as many of their officers, pri&s;oners under the convention, as we can.</P>
<P>Commi&s;&s;ioners from me are to meet others from general Howe on the thirty-fir&s;t of this month, to endeavour to &s;ettle a general exchange of pri&s;oners. Until we know the i&s;&s;ue of the negociation, it will be hardly worth while to alter the &s;ituation of the pri&s;oners in Lanca&s;ter county.</P>
<P>On the twenty-&s;eventh of February I had occa&s;ion to write to Congre&s;s, on the &s;ubject of yours of the third. It was occa&s;ioned by a repre&s;entation from the colonel of the thirteenth Virginia regiment which was rai&s;ed (as colonel M^cKay's and Cooke's were) to remain upon the frontier. Were this the ca&s;e with only one regiment, I &s;hould not he&s;itate, con&s;idering the face of affairs to the we&s;tward, to order it immediately to Fort-Pitt or the neighbourhood. But the eighth and twelfth Penn&s;ylvania, and the twelfth and thirteenth Virginia, all claim the &s;ame right; and if the indulgence is granted to one, the others will be di&s;&s;at|isfied: and to &s;pare them all at this time is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>To regain the de&s;erters from tho&s;e regiments is certainly a very de&s;irable thing: and the mode you point out is the mo&s;t probable. But I fear, if tho&s;e men who are now here find that the de&s;erters are not to be brought down to join
<PB N="224" REF="029737_0562_0FE29BF2EA577658">
their regiments in camp, that they may be induced to go off, in hopes of obtaining the &s;ame terms. I confe&s;s I am much embarra&s;&s;ed by this matter, and &s;hall be exceedingly glad to have the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Congre&s;s and the board upon the &s;ubject, before I come to any determination. It is an evil that will ever re&s;ult from enli&s;tments for local purpo&s;es, when it is not convenient to abide by the agree|ment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall immediately tran&s;mit the papers, inclo&s;ed in yours of the fourth, to general Howe.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Sunday night I had the honour to receive your favours of the fir&s;t and fifth in&s;tant, with their inclo&s;ures.</P>
<P>I am happy to find that my pa&s;t conduct re&s;pecting citi|zens, in the corre&s;pondence between general Howe and my&s;elf, is approved by Congre&s;s. They may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that their rights are &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on my mind; and that, in all my tran&s;actions, every &s;upport in my power &s;hall be given them. I know their importance; and, in my ex|pected negociations with general Howe, if po&s;&s;ible, I will exempt citizens from captivity. However, I cannot hope to effect it, as I cannot demand it as a matter of right, &s;ince Congre&s;s them&s;elves, in their original re&s;olve directing a propo&s;ition to be made for the exchange of pri&s;oners, mentioned that of citizens,&mdash;which implied a right of cap|turing them.</P>
<P>They may al&s;o be a&s;&s;ured that general Lee will not be forgotten. He has all along been a principal object in di&s;|pute: and, &s;o far from doing any thing injurious to him, his
<PB N="225" REF="029737_0563_0FE29C50E9915B80">
right to be exchanged, and his relea&s;ement, are intended to be placed upon the mo&s;t explicit, unambiguous footing. Indeed, from the &s;pirit of general Howe's letters collective|ly taken, &s;ince his agreement to enlarge the officers on pa|role in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and his exten&s;ion of it in the la&s;t to an exchange,&mdash;though they are not free from ambigui|ties,&mdash;it may be inferred, that, on &s;ending in lieutenant-col|onel Campbell and the He&s;&s;ian field-officers captured at Trenton, an exchange of all officers will immediately com|mence. It &s;eems to be a point with him that it &s;hall be|gin with them, as they have been longe&s;t in captivity. I have taken the liberty to inclo&s;e you copies of three letters which have ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed between general Howe and my&s;elf, more particularly concerning general Lee, in which I have pu&s;hed matters re&s;pecting him as far as I thought it pru|dent at this time. Every precaution will certainly be u&s;ed to prevent the enemy gaining any advantage in the ex|change of pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>With great deference, I would take the liberty to ob|&s;erve that Congre&s;s &s;eem to have carried the preamble of their re&s;olve of the twenty-&s;ixth ultimo, prohibiting the en|li&s;ting, &amp;c. pri&s;oners and de&s;erters, too far; and, through accident, to have recited a fact that has never happened (at lea&s;t to my knowledge) and which is injurious to us,&mdash;viz. that pri&s;oners had been enli&s;ted by us. If any have, it is what I never knew. However, be this as it may, if the re&s;olution has not been publi&s;hed, I could wi&s;h the preamble to be altered, and only to recite, <HI>"that experience,</HI> &amp;c. in <HI>de&s;erters"</HI> only. The re&s;olution it&s;elf may &s;tand as it does, comprehending a prohibition again&s;t the en|li&s;tment of both.</P>
<P>My rea&s;on for troubling Congre&s;s upon this occa&s;ion is, we have always complained again&s;t general Howe, and &s;till do, for obliging or permitting the pri&s;oners in his hands to enli&s;t, as an unwarrantable procedure, and wholly re|pugnant to the &s;pirit at lea&s;t of the cartel. This preamble &s;eems to admit the practice on our part, which would cer|tainly ju&s;tify it in him, and is &s;uch evidence as mu&s;t &s;ilence us in future, (&s;hould it &s;tand) and afford him an opportu|nity for recrimination,&mdash;though, as I have &s;ugge&s;ted, I be|lieve
<PB N="226" REF="029737_0564_0FE29BF4A596C998">
no pri&s;oners have ever been enli&s;ted by us,&mdash;I am &s;ure none have through compul&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have the plea&s;ure to tran&s;mit you an extract of a letter from captain Barry, which will inform you of his &s;ucce&s;&s;es. The two &s;hips he burned after &s;tripping them; and he was obliged, it &s;eems, two days after the capture, to ground and abandon the &s;chooner, after a long and &s;evere engagement with &s;ome of the enemy's frigates and &s;maller armed ve&s;&s;els. It is &s;aid he &s;aved her guns and mo&s;t of her tackle.</P>
<P>I al&s;o take the liberty to lay before Congre&s;s copies of letters from me&s;&s;ieurs Champion, W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d&s;worth, and Reed. From the uniformity of &s;entiment held forth by the&s;e gen|tlemen, it is much to be feared the mea&s;ures lately adopted by the commi&s;&s;ioners at New-Haven, for regulating the prices of provi&s;ion, will have a di&s;agreeable effect upon our &s;upplies of meat. How far it may be practicable to &s;u&s;|pend their operation for a time, I cannot determine: but, if it can be done, it appears we &s;hould experience many ad|vantages from it. It is a matter of great importance; and, as &s;uch, is &s;ubmitted to Congre&s;s for their con&s;ideration. If any thing can be done to procure &s;upplies of provi&s;ion, particularly of the &s;alt kind, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, and am per|&s;uaded, it will not be omitted.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS will be pre&s;ented to you by count Pula&s;ki, who, from a conviction that his remaining at the head of the cavalry was a con&s;tant &s;ubject of unea&s;ine&s;s to the prin|cipal officers of that corps, has been induced to re&s;ign his command. Waving a minute inquiry into the cau&s;es of di&s;&s;atisfaction,&mdash;which may be reduced perhaps to the di&s;|advantages under which he laboured, as a &s;tranger not well acquainted with the language, genius and manners of this country,&mdash;it may be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the degree of harmony which is in&s;eparable from the well-being and con&s;equent utility of a corps, has not &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the cavalry &s;ince his appointment, and that the mo&s;t effectual as well
<PB N="227" REF="029737_0565_0FE29C526C6A4CE0">
as the ea&s;ie&s;t remedy is that which he has generou&s;ly applied.</P>
<P>The count, however, far from being di&s;gu&s;ted with the &s;ervice, is led by his thir&s;t of glory, and zeal for the cau&s;e of liberty, to &s;olicit farther employment, and waits upon Congre&s;s to make his propo&s;als. They are briefly that he be allowed to rai&s;e an independent corps compo&s;ed of &s;ixty-eight hor&s;e and two hundred foot,&mdash;the hor&s;e to be armed wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h lances, and the foot equipped in the manner of light infantry. The former he thinks he can readily fill with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ives of good character and worthy the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them. With re&s;pect to the other, he is de&s;irous of more latitude, &s;o as to have liberty of engaging pri&s;oners and de|&s;erters from the enemy.</P>
<P>The original plan for the lance-men was to have draught|ed them from the regiments of hor&s;e. But as this method <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> produce a cla&s;hing of intere&s;ts and perhaps occa&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;turbances, the count prefers having a corps totally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">nnected with any other. My advice to him, therefore, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> enli&s;t his number of cavalry with the continental boun|ty&punc; and, if it &s;hould be found con&s;onant to the views of Congre&s;s to allow his rai&s;ing the number propo&s;ed over and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the e&s;tabli&s;hment for the hor&s;e, then he would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on the footing of an independent corps&punc; if not, he might at all events have them as draughts; and in this ca&s;e there would be no ground for complaint.</P>
<P>with regard to the infantry, which the count e&s;teems e&s;|&s;ential to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ucce&s;s of the cavalry, I have informed him that the enli&s;ting de&s;erters and pri&s;oners is prohibited by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;olve of Congre&s;s. How far congre&s;s might be in|clined to make an exception, and licen&s;e the engaging pri&s;|oners in a particular detached corps, in which &s;uch charac|ters may be admitted with le&s;s danger than promi&s;cuou&s;ly is the line, I cannot undertake to pronounce.</P>
<P>I have only to add that the count's valour and active zeal on all occa&s;ions have done him great honour; and from a per&s;ua&s;ion, that, by being le&s;s expo&s;ed to the inconveni|ences which he has hitherto experienced, he will render <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ervices with &s;uch a command as he a&s;ks for, I wi&s;h him to &s;ucceed in his application.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour to tran&s;mit you a letter from governor Clinton which he inclo&s;ed to me for my peru&s;al and con&s;ideration. The inconvenience he mentions, as re|&s;ulting from the re&s;olve re&s;pecting the appointment of a commandant for Forts Montgomery and Clinton, requires to be obviated. I do not conceive it to have been the de|&s;ign of Congre&s;s to make the command of tho&s;e forts alto|gether di&s;tinct and independent on the general command of the po&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> in that quarter; but only to de&s;ignate the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the officer who &s;hould have the immediate charge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them.</P>
<P>There is &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n intimate connexion between the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and the other po&s;ts and pa&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es in the Highlands and their vicinity, that it is nece&s;&s;ary for one officer to have the &s;uper|intendency and control of the whole, and to be an&s;wera|ble for all. If this were not to be the ca&s;e, but the command were to be divided, there might want that co-operation be|tween the garri&s;ons and the troops without, which might be e&s;&s;ential to their pre&s;ervation and to the common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|po&s;es of defence. The a&s;&s;igning a fixed number of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the garri&s;ons would not remove this inconvenience; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the co-operation would &s;till be nece&s;&s;ary. But if it were otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould not think the mea&s;ure advi&s;eable, be|cau&s;e we do not know what number of men we may have in the field next campaign; and the number for the defence of the Highlands mu&s;t be proportioned to the general &s;trength; and the force of the garri&s;ons, to that number.</P>
<P>On the&s;e con&s;iderations, having ordered general M^cDou|gal to repair to the Highlands to a&s;&s;ume the chief command there, I have comprehended the forts among the other ob|jects of his tru&s;t; in the di&s;charge of which, I am per&s;uaded he will manife&s;t adequate zeal and ability. But as the re|&s;olve
<PB N="229" REF="029737_0567_0FE29C53F02921D0">
in que&s;tion affords room for doubt, it will be proper to have it explained, &s;o as more explicitly to a&s;certain the intention of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>I am perfectly in &s;entiment with governor Clinton on the propriety of drawing the troops from the northward to re|inforce and carry on the works in the Highlands. From every thing I can learn, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ere &s;eems to be no pro&s;pect of pro&s;ecuting the intended expedition into Canada. If &s;o, I apprehend it can an&s;wer no valuable end to keep a body of troops in and about Albany. In the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of Canada, little is to be dreaded thence: the enemy, in all probability, will be well &s;atisfied to act on the defen&s;ive, without ri&s;king the con&s;equences of an attempt again&s;t us. A proper garri&s;on at Fort-Schuyler, and a &s;mall party by way of guard at Albany, with the militia of the country that may be occa&s;ionally drawn together, will be a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity again&s;t the inroads of the enemy from Canada, or the depredations of the neighbouring Indians, &s;uppo&s;ing there were any of the tribes who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions were &s;till actively ho&s;tile notwith&s;tanding our late northern &s;ucce&s;&s;es, which is by no means a natural &s;uppo&s;ition. All the men, more than are wanted for the&s;e purpo&s;es, would be of the mo&s;t important utility in the Highlands.</P>
<P>If the arms and &s;tores <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Albany &s;hould be thought an objection to the plan, I would beg leave to ob&s;erve that Al|bany appears to me a mo&s;t improper place for &s;tationary ar&s;enals or magazines, and that tho&s;e which are there at pre&s;ent &s;hould be removed without delay. Be&s;ides, as they would be in mo&s;t danger from an incur&s;ion up the North-river, the be&s;t way to counteract that danger is to &s;trength|en the pa&s;&s;es in the Highlands, and ob&s;truct the navigation; in order to which, the reinforcing them with the troops from the northward would be no incon&s;iderable &s;tep.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS will be delivered you by captain Sullivan, who waits on Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject of pay and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="230" REF="029737_0568_0FE29BF7ADB16EF8">
his rank in the line of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts officers. He is one of the gentlemen, who, in going with major Sherburne to relieve the po&s;t we had at the Cedars in 1776, after a brave and gallant conduct, fell into the enemy's hands. In a few days after, on the treaty which general Arnold made, he generou&s;ly offered him&s;elf, as I have been informed, and went one of the ho&s;tages to Quebec, for the perform|ance of it.</P>
<P>By &s;ome means the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay has not continued him in their line, nor has he any appointment in the army. He is now on parole through the indulgence of general Carleton, and has applied to me for pay and rations from the time of his return: and con&s;idering al&s;o the depri|vation of his rank as hard and injurious, he hopes he will be provided for in a &s;uitable manner, and according to that &s;tanding which he formerly held in the army.</P>
<P>Captain Sullivan's wi&s;hes in either in&s;tance cannot be an|&s;wered by me. As to the fir&s;t, the re&s;olution of the nine|teenth of January, regulating the pay of pri&s;oners (which is the only rule for my government) &s;eems to have drawn the line between officers on parole who are continued in &s;ervice, and tho&s;e who are not; and, making that the only criterion to fix pay, to have precluded every other di&s;crim|ination; and the powers, which were ve&s;ted in the re&s;pect|ive States to appoint officers, prohibit any interference by me in his favour, as to the latter.</P>
<P>I have &s;tated the nature of the captain's claims, and the rea&s;ons which are oppo&s;ed to his obtaining relief in either in&s;tance from me. I &s;hall only add that the neglect by the States (in their appointments) of the officers who were in captivity, where there was no other objection to them, was at lea&s;t ungenerous, if not impolitic and unju&s;t. It has been the ca&s;e in many in&s;tances: and as to the gentlemen who is particularly the &s;ubject of this letter, the te&s;timonials that have been given of his character as an officer were much in his favour, and greatly to his honour.</P>
<P>By accident, the re&s;olution of the nineteenth of January, alluded to above, has been mi&s;laid. I mu&s;t trouble you with a reque&s;t for another copy of it.</P>
<P>I tran&s;mit Congre&s;s colonel * * *'s application to re|&s;ign. As general Huntington, in who&s;e brigade he is, and
<PB N="231" REF="029737_0569_0FE29C5DA74DFF18">
in whom I have the utmo&s;t confidence, is perfectly willing, I have only to &s;ay upon the occa&s;ion that I have not the &s;malle&s;t objection to the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>General Sullivan &s;et out for Rhode-I&s;land on Friday la&s;t to take the command there, in con&s;equence of the re&s;olu|tion of Congre&s;s directing me to &s;end a major-general there for that purpo&s;e.

<P>ON Saturday I had the honour to receive your fa|vour of the tenth, with the re&s;olutions alluded to.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed I take the liberty to tran&s;mit an extract of a letter ju&s;t received from general Par&s;ons. This, as well as the letter which I inclo&s;ed you ye&s;terday from governor Clinton, will &s;hew the confu&s;ion in the management of af|fairs on the North-river. I informed Congre&s;s then that I had &s;ent general M^cDougal to take the chief command there, comprehending the forts,&mdash;which appeared to me the only effectual means for curing all di&s;orders, and pro|moting the public &s;ervice. To remove all impediments, it were to be wi&s;hed that Congre&s;s would inve&s;t him with every nece&s;&s;ary power for carrying into execution the objects of his command: and it might be well if they were to ex|tend to any future commanding officer, as it would prevent tho&s;e difficulties which have heretofore ari&s;en from their having been con&s;idered as merely per&s;onal.</P>
<P>I am more and more in &s;entiment with governor Clin|ton on the propriety and ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of drawing the troops from the northward, to reinforce and carry on the works in the Highlands. From the information I have from colonel Radiere who has ju&s;t come from thence, I find that the intended defences are far le&s;s advanced than I had any idea of. According to him, little or nothing is yet done, though I have repeatedly and con&s;tantly urged the pro&s;ecution of them with all po&s;&s;ible indu&s;try. The in|clo&s;ed copies of my letters to general Putnam will &s;hew
<PB N="232" REF="029737_0570_0FE29C015CDC0FC0">
that I have uniformly pre&s;&s;ed the clo&s;e&s;t attention to the bu&s;ine&s;s, though it might be inferred from general Par&s;ons's letter that there had been &s;ome incon&s;i&s;tency in my orders. There remains but a little time to do a great deal in; and I fear that no exertions now will be &s;ufficient to place things in that quarter on the &s;ecure and re&s;pectacle footing we could wi&s;h. However, we &s;hould do the mo&s;t we can: and if the works cannot be as complete as they ought, the troops will be there; and a reliance mu&s;t be had in their bravery, to repel any attempt that may be formed again&s;t them.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honour of tran&s;mitting you the inclo&s;|ed letter from general Smallwood, giving intelligence of the enemy's motions on the Delaware, and his conjectures re|&s;pecting their object. The account he has heard of troops being on board the ve&s;&s;els is confirmed by the relations of de&s;erters and others, who agree that a con&s;iderable number of men have been embarked, and add that they took &s;even|teen day's provi&s;ion with them. From this circum&s;tance it is &s;carcely to be imagined that they are ordered on a &s;ea voyage. The proportion of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els in the fleet makes it probable that they have in view to collect forage, or at|tempt the de&s;truction of the &s;alt-works; and both the&s;e ideas are favoured by accounts from the city. As &s;oon as their intentions are certainly known, they &s;hall be commu|nicated. In the mean time I have the honour to be, with the greate&s;t re&s;pect, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honour of yours of the fourteenth and fifteenth in&s;tant. In con&s;equence of the re&s;olves tran&s;mitted to me, I have di&s;patched an expre&s;s to the marquis De la Fayette and Baron de Kalb, to recall them from the north|ward: and&punc; in&s;tead of ordering down Hazen's regiment to

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HEREWITH I do my&s;elf the honour to inclo&s;e cop|ies of a letter from an officer of militia at Elizabethtown, to me, and an extract of a letter from one of Mr. Boudi|not's deputies at Bo&s;ton, to him,&mdash;both tending to induce a belief that the enemy have &s;ome enterpri&s;e in contempla|tion. What this is, time mu&s;t di&s;cover. I have this whole winter been clearly of opinion that general Howe's movements would be very early this &s;pring, to take ad|vantage of the weak &s;tate of our army,&mdash;or late, if he ex|pected con&s;iderable reinforcements from England, and meant to avail him&s;elf of his full &s;trength. If the fir&s;t takes place, as appearances indicate, it may, I think, be con&s;id|ered as a proof of one or both of the&s;e two things, that he is either well informed (he cannot indeed be otherwi&s;e) of the &s;ituation, and more than probably, of the &s;trength of our army, or that he expects no incon&s;iderable reinforce|ments this year from Europe. In either ca&s;e it is our in|di&s;pen&s;able duty to reinforce and arrange our army, as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, that we may in the fir&s;t in&s;tance be prepared for defence,&mdash;in the &s;econd, take advantage of any favourable circum&s;tance which may happen, to injure the enemy.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the de&s;igns of Congre&s;s with re&s;pect to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the army, I know not: but I do mo&s;t earne&s;tly and devoutly recommend a &s;peedy adoption of them, and the appointment of officers, as our pre&s;ent &s;ituation at this advanced &s;ea&s;on is truly alarming, and to me highly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, as I am convinced that we &s;hall be plunged into the campaign before our arrangements are made, and the army properly organized.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="029737_0572_0FE29C04DA381110">
The numberle&s;s di&s;advantages, re&s;ulting from the late appointment of general officers la&s;t year, make me look for|ward with infinite anxiety, this:&mdash;for, after all the wi&s;dom that Congre&s;s or their committee can u&s;e in the choice of officers, many will be di&s;gu&s;ted: re&s;ignations of &s;ome and perhaps non-acceptance of others will follow. Before matters then can be brought to a proper tone, much time will be lo&s;t, and a great deal of trouble and vexation en|countered,&mdash;to overcome which, is not the work of a day; and, till they are overcome, confu&s;ion, di&s;order, and lo&s;s, mu&s;t prevail. In the meanwhile, order, regularity, and di&s;cipline,&mdash;which require the vigilance of every officer to e&s;tabli&s;h, and mu&s;t flow from the general officers in every army,&mdash;are neglected, or not entered upon in time to ef|fect. Thus it happened la&s;t year; and brigades and divi|&s;ions became vacant, to the great injury of the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As it is not improper for Congre&s;s to have &s;ome idea of the pre&s;ent temper of the army, it may not be ami&s;s to re|mark in this place, that, &s;ince the month of Augu&s;t la&s;t, be|tween two and three hundred officers have re&s;igned their commi&s;&s;ions, and many others were with difficulty di&s;&s;uaded from it. In the Virginia line only, not le&s;s than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ix colonels, as good as any in the &s;ervice, have left it lately; and more, I am told, are in the humour to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Highly advantageous al&s;o would it be, if the recruits and draughts from North-Carolina and Virginia were not &s;uffered to halt on their way to camp under pretence of get|ting equipped, but &s;ent forward and incorporated into the dif|ferent regiments of their re&s;pective States as &s;oon as it could be done. Out of the number of men &s;aid to be draughted in Virginia la&s;t fall, and others from North-Carolina, very few have joined the army; but owing to de&s;ertion and oth|er cau&s;es, they have dwindled to nothing: and this will always be the ca&s;e with new recruits, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are unwillingly drawn forth, if much time is &s;pent in get|ting them to their regiments under the care of proper of|ficers. This &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity (if the &s;ea&s;on and other powerful rea&s;ons did not loudly call for it) of ha&s;tening them to the army.</P>
<P>My &s;olicitude for the pre&s;ervation of the communication of the North-river gives me very unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations on ac|count
<PB N="235" REF="029737_0573_0FE29C60CBB928E0">
of our po&s;ts there, and will excu&s;e my again a&s;king if the troops to the northward, except &s;uch as are nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of Fort-Schuyler, can be &s;o advantageou&s;ly employed as at the works on that river. A re&s;pectable force at tho&s;e po&s;ts would awe New-York, and divide general Howe's force or expo&s;e the city. To depend too much upon militia, is, in my opinion, putting every thing to hazard.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould appear uncommonly anxious re&s;pecting the &s;everal matters contained in this letter, by repeating them, Congre&s;s will do me the ju&s;tice, I hope, to believe that I am actuated by no views but &s;uch as are prompted by cir|cum&s;tances and the advanced &s;ea&s;on.

<P>I HAVE been honoured with yours of the twenty-fifth, inclo&s;ing duplicates of two former re&s;olves of Con|gre&s;s, and a re&s;olve of the twenty-third in&s;tant, accepting the re&s;ignation of colonel Charles Webb.</P>
<P>Since mine of the twenty-fourth, Mr. Boudinot has communicated the following intelligence, being part of a letter to him:&mdash;"I have lately received &s;ome intelligence from New-York, that we may make our&s;elves ea&s;y in Jer|&s;ey, as all the force that can be &s;pared is to be &s;ent to join

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you upon the twenty-ninth ultimo, I have not been able to learn with any preci&s;ion whether the tran&s;ports that arrived brought any con&s;iderable number of troops. A He&s;&s;ian de&s;erter &s;ays there were only a few German convale&s;cents on board. If &s;o, the fleet with two thou&s;and five hundred, mentioned in my la&s;t, is not arrived, &s;uppo&s;ing they were bound to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>General St. Clair arrived ye&s;terday from Bo&s;ton: and, as he &s;eems very anxious to have his matter determined one way or the other, I beg leave to recall the attention of Congre&s;s to my letter of the twenty-&s;eventh of February upon that &s;ubject.

<P>CAPTAIN Lee of the light dragoons, and the of|ficers under his command, having uniformly di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by a conduct of exemplary zeal, prudence and bravery, I took occa&s;ion, on a late &s;ignal in&s;tance of it, to expre&s;s the high &s;en&s;e I entertained of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> merit, and to a&s;&s;ure him that it &s;hould not fail of being properly noticed.

<P>I had it in contemplation at the time, in ca&s;e no other method more eligible could be adopted, to make him an offer of a place in my family. I have con&s;ulted the com|mittee of Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject, and we were mutually of opinion that the giving captain Lee the command of two troops of hor&s;e on the propo&s;ed e&s;tabli&s;hment, with the rank of major, to act as an independent partizan corps, would be a mode of rewarding him, very advantageous to the &s;ervice.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now the honour to acknowledge your &s;ev|eral letters of the twenty-fir&s;t, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth ultimo, with their inclo&s;ures, which have been duly re|ceived. It gives me pain to ob&s;erve they appear to con|tain &s;everal implications by which my &s;en&s;ibility is not a little wounded. I find my&s;elf extremely embarra&s;&s;ed by the &s;teps I had taken towards an exchange of pri&s;oners and the formation of a general cartel making more ample provi&s;ion for their future accommodation and relief. The views of Congre&s;s &s;eem to be very different from what I &s;uppo&s;ed them when I entered into my late engagements with general Howe: their re&s;olution of the thirtieth ulti|mo, pointedly requiring a &s;trict adherence to all former ones upon the &s;ubject, will in all probability render them impracticable. I con&s;idered &s;ome of their re&s;olutions as dictated on the principle of retaliation, and did not imag|ine the terms they contained would be in&s;i&s;ted upon in negociating an agreement calculated to remedy the evils which occa&s;ioned them. In mo&s;t re&s;pects they might be &s;ub&s;tantially complied with: but there are &s;ome points to which an exact conformity mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity de&s;troy the idea of a cartel. One is the obliging the enemy to pay gold and &s;ilver on equal terms for continental currency, e&s;timating the articles &s;upplied them at their actual prices with us, as &s;eems to be the de&s;ign of the re&s;olve of the nineteenth of December: another is the &s;ubjecting the in|habitants
<PB N="239" REF="029737_0577_0FE29C6D4CA57128">
of the&s;e States, taken in arms again&s;t them, to trial and puni&s;hment, agreeable to the re&s;olve of the thir|tieth of the &s;ame month.</P>
<P>I am well aware that appearances ought to be upheld, and that we &s;hould avoid as much as po&s;&s;ible recognizing by any public act the depreciation of our currency: but I conceive this end would be an&s;wered as far as might be nece&s;&s;ary, by &s;tipulating that all money payments &s;hould be made in gold and &s;ilver, being the common medium of commerce among nations, at the rate of four &s;hillings and &s;ix pence for a Spani&s;h milled dollar, &amp;c.&mdash;by fixing the price of rations on an equitable &s;cale relatively to our re|&s;pective circum&s;tances,&mdash;and providing for the payment of what we may owe, by &s;ending in provi&s;ion, and &s;elling it at their market. The rates of money, and the prices of provi&s;ions and other commodities, differ every where: and, in treaties of a &s;imilar nature between any two States, it is requi&s;ite, for mutual convenience, to a&s;certain &s;ome common ratio both for the value of money in payments, and for the rates of tho&s;e articles on which they may ari&s;e.</P>
<P>It was determined on mature con&s;ideration not to con|clude any thing expre&s;sly that &s;hould contradict the re&s;o|lution of the thirtieth of December: but at the &s;ame time, if it is de&s;igned to be the rule of practice, it is ea&s;y to per|ceive it would at once overturn any cartel that could be formed. General Howe would never con&s;ent to ob&s;erve it on his part, if &s;uch a practice were to exi&s;t on ours. Though the law ought not to be contravened by an ex|pre&s;s article admitting the exchangeability of &s;uch per&s;ons, yet, if it is not &s;uffered o &s;leep, it is in vain to expect the operation of it will be acquie&s;ced in by the enemy.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ures I have taken mu&s;t evince that it is my determination to pay the fulle&s;t attention to the intere&s;ts of citizens, and to the rights of generel Lee, in the treaty: and I think it but ju&s;tice to the gentlemen appointed to negociate it, to declare that I know them to be &s;o fully impre&s;&s;ed with the importance of both tho&s;e objects, as to make them cheerfully ob&s;ervant of the injunctions of Con|gre&s;s, &s;o far as not to conclude any agreement of which the exchange of general Lee and the alternative re&s;pecting
<PB N="240" REF="029737_0578_0FE29C0FF9C2D1C8">
citizens are not e&s;&s;ential parts. The&s;e points had been early determined on.</P>
<P>It is with no &s;mall concern that I have been obliged to trouble Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubjects of this letter: and, &s;hould they appear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them in the &s;ame light they do to me, and they &s;hould think proper to remove the ob&s;tacles which now oppo&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s in hand, I mu&s;t reque&s;t they will be plea&s;ed to communicate their determination as expeditiou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible, that the commi&s;&s;ioners may govern them&s;elves accordingly, and either proceed to form|ing a cartel, or put an end to the negociation. Before the re&s;olves of the thirtieth came to hand, they had m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t, and been in treaty two days, with a pro&s;pect of a favoura|ble accommodation.</P>
<P>I am happy to inform Congre&s;s that general Lee will be out on parole to-morrow in place of general Pre&s;cot: and I have every rea&s;on to expect, if the negociation can be continued upon admi&s;&s;ible terms, that his exchange will immediately follow the relea&s;ement of colonel Campbell and the He&s;&s;ian field-officers. It is agreed that lieuten|ant-colonel Allen &s;hall be exchanged for lieutenant-colonel Campbell.</P>
<P>The importunate applications of colonel Lee and major Swazey to leave the &s;ervice oblige me to lay the matter before Congre&s;s. Colonel Lee's letter upon the &s;ubject was tran&s;mitted me the twenty-fifth of January: but, hop|ing he might change his mind, I deferred writing to Con|gre&s;s upon his reque&s;t. He has renewed it again in urgent terms, through general Heath; and I have only to ob|&s;erve that it is a painful circum&s;tance to &s;ee officers of their merit leaving the &s;ervice. It is the ca&s;e every day. I &s;hall be obliged by Congre&s;s informing me of the dates of the re&s;ignations of the colonels in the Virginia line: I have only received the date of colonel Lewis's.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed is a letter from captain Cotteneau of the &s;hip Ferdinand, with an invoice of her cargo.

<P>I HAVE had the honour of receiving your favour of the fourth in&s;tant, inclo&s;ing a re&s;olve of Congre&s;s, of the &s;ame date, empowering me to call forth five thou&s;and mi|litia from the States of Maryland, Penn&s;ylvania, and New-Jer&s;ey. I thank Congre&s;s for the power: at the &s;ame time it is incumbent on me to a&s;&s;ure them, that,&mdash;granting the practicability of collecting &s;uch a number,&mdash;it would prove a work of time, difficulty and expen&s;e; to evince which, I need only recur to the experience of la&s;t cam|paign on &s;imilar occa&s;ions, and to remind you that it was not po&s;&s;ible to obtain a thou&s;and men, nor &s;ometimes even one hundred, from this State, although the former number was required and promi&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of covering during the winter the country between Schuylkill and Delaware.</P>
<P>As this re&s;olve appears to have been made in con&s;e|quence of my letters of the twenty-fourth and twe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ultimo, which were founded on conjecture, and, in &s;ome degree, mi&s;information,&mdash;and as the execution of it would,

exclu&s;ive of the inconveniences abovementioned, I am per|&s;uaded, have a tendency to injure the completion of the continental regiments,&mdash;I &s;hall call for a &s;mall part only of the number allowed; but could wi&s;h that Hartley's regiment were ordered immediately to camp, and the du|ties of it performed by militia. In like manner I would propo&s;e that all remote guards &s;hould be compo&s;ed of mi|litia, and that the &s;everal purpo&s;es for which men are drawn from the continental troops &s;hould be an&s;wered by them. This would be a means of drawing together a con&s;idera|ble number of men who are in a manner lo&s;t to the ar|my, and of employing the militia to the be&s;t advantage po&s;&s;ible.</P>

Should any convul&s;ion happen, or movement take place, they will be altogether impracticable. Ju&s;tice to my own character, as well as duty to the public, con|&s;train me to repeat the&s;e things: their con&s;equences are more ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid by &s;ome, Sir, that my wi&s;h to &s;ee the of|ficers of this army upon a more re&s;pectable e&s;tabli&s;hment is the cau&s;e of my &s;olicitude, and carries me too far. To &s;uch I can declare that my anxiety proceeds from the cau&s;es abovementioned. If my opinion is a&s;ked with re|&s;pect to the nece&s;&s;ity of making this provi&s;ion for the offi|cers, I am ready to declare that I do mo&s;t religiou&s;ly be|lieve the &s;alvation of the cau&s;e depends upon it,&mdash;and, without it, your officers will moulder to nothing, or be compo&s;ed of low and illiterate men, void of capacity for
<PB N="243" REF="029737_0581_0FE29C12D1EE1680">
this or any other bu&s;ine&s;s. To prove this, I can with truth aver, that &s;carce a day pa&s;&s;es without the offer of two or three commi&s;&s;ions; and my advices from the ea&s;tward and &s;outhward are that numbers who had gone home on furlough mean not to return, but are e&s;tabli&s;hing them|&s;elves in more lucrative employments. Let Congre&s;s de|termine what will be the con&s;equence of this &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Per&s;onally, as an officer, I have no intere&s;t in their de|ci&s;ion, becau&s;e I have declared, and I now repeat it, that I never will receive the &s;malle&s;t benefit from the half-pay e&s;tabli&s;hment: but, as a man who fights under the weight of a pro&s;cription, and as a citizen who wi&s;hes to &s;ee the liberty of his country e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a permanent foun|dation, and who&s;e property depends upon the &s;ucce&s;s of our arms, I am deeply intere&s;ted. But,&mdash;all this apart, and ju&s;tice out of the que&s;tion,&mdash;upon the &s;ingle ground of economy and public &s;aving, I will maintain the utility of it: for I have not the lea&s;t doubt, that, until officers con|&s;ider their commi&s;&s;ions in an honourable and intere&s;ted point of view, and are afraid to endanger them by negli|gence and inattention, no order, regularity or care, either of the men or public property, will prevail. * * *</P>
<P>By officers who are ju&s;t returned from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, I learn that there is not the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of getting men from thence before the month of June,&mdash;if then; and indeed that there is no rea&s;on to expect any number that will de&s;erve the name of reinforcement for the conti|nental regiments this campaign,&mdash;the towns being only called upon to furni&s;h the deficiency of their la&s;t year's quota, &s;o that all &s;ub&s;equent ca&s;ualties are di&s;regarded, and the fifteen regiments of that State, which may now per|haps want four thou&s;and men to complete them, will re|ceive only five hundred if the towns came within that number of their complement la&s;t year. What change the requi&s;ition of Congre&s;s, of the [<HI>twenty-&s;ixth</HI>] of February, may effect, I &s;hall not undertake to &s;ay: if it has not a &s;peedy and powerful operation, our pro&s;pects in that quar|ter will be exceedingly unpromi&s;ing.</P>
<P>A gentleman from New-Hamp&s;hire &s;ome little time &s;ince informed me that matters were nearly in the &s;ame train there, notwith&s;tanding a re&s;olve for the completion of
<PB N="244" REF="029737_0582_0FE29C145A0FF770">
their battalions; and the inclo&s;ed copy of a letter (N^o 1) from general Putnam, whom I have de&s;ired to remain in Connecticut for &s;ome time in order to forward the recruits from that State, conveys his ideas of what may be expected from thence. What New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, and North-Carolina have done or are about to do, I know not. Penn&s;ylvania and Maryland have tried the effect of vol|untary enli&s;tments to little purpo&s;e; and the fir&s;t, in direct contradiction to the mo&s;t pointed injunctions laid on the officers, have their recruits compo&s;ed chiefly of de&s;erters who will embrace the fir&s;t opportunity of e&s;caping with our arms. Virginia, it is true, has proceeded to a draught: but the number, be&s;ides being in it&s;elf inadequate, has been le&s;&s;ened by de&s;ertion; and the deficiency of the regiments, on the other hand, being increa&s;ed by death and de&s;ertion, their &s;trength will probably fall very far &s;hort of the new e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is not a flattering picture of our affairs: but the repre&s;entation is ju&s;t; and it is incumbent on me to exhibit it in my own defence, as, notwith&s;tanding all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> unfavourable circum&s;tances,&mdash;and what is to me a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pro&s;pect of being plunged into the campaign before the ar|rangements are made, officers, appointed, &amp;c.&mdash;great mat|ters, I perceive, are expected from our activity this &s;pring&punc; in proportion therefore will the di&s;appointment be felt by tho&s;e who are &s;anguine. For want of the ratification of Congre&s;s, the hor&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hment, companies of &s;appers, provo&s;t-mar&s;hal&s;ey, &amp;c. &amp;c. (as agreed to by the commit|tee, and recommended for their con&s;ideration) are entirely at a &s;tand, at a time when we ought to be deriving benefits from their execution. In a word, at no period &s;ince the commencement of the war have I felt more painful &s;en&s;a|tions on account of delay, than at the pre&s;ent: and, urged by them, I have expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf without re&s;erve.</P>
<P>By a letter ju&s;t received from general Weedon, I am informed of his intention to re&s;ign, if general Woodford &s;hould be re&s;tored to his former rank, which he had not then heard. General Muhlenberg is now balancing on the &s;ame point. One, therefore, if not two brigadiers, will be wanted for that State. The di&s;advantages re&s;ulting from the frequent re&s;ignations in the Virginia line, the

changes of commanding officers to the regiments, and other cau&s;es equally di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, have injured that corps beyond conception, and have been the means of reducing very re&s;pectable regiments in &s;ome in&s;tances to a mere handful of men: and this will ever be the ca&s;e till officers can be fixed by &s;omething equivalent to the &s;acrifice they make. To rea&s;on otherwi&s;e, and &s;uppo&s;e that public virtue alone will enable men to forego the ea&s;e and comforts of life, to encounter the hard&s;hips and dangers of war for a bare &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, when their companions and friends are ama&s;&s;ing large fortunes,&mdash;is viewing human nature rather as it &s;hould be, than as it really is.</P>
<P>The clothier-general of the army, as well as the heads of every other department, &s;hould be in camp near the commander in chief: otherwi&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible that the operations of war can be conducted with energy and pre|ci&s;ion. I wi&s;h mo&s;t &s;incerely that this,&mdash;as not the lea&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ettled with the committee,&mdash;were decided, and a thorough inve&s;tigation were had into the conduct of this department; as it is a matter of uni|ver&s;al a&s;toni&s;hment that we &s;hould be deficient in any arti|cle of clothing, when it is commonly a&s;&s;erted that the ea&s;t|ern States alone can furni&s;h materials enough to clothe a hundred thou&s;and men.

<P>I &s;hall make no apology for the freedom of this letter. To inform Congre&s;s of &s;uch facts as materially affect the &s;ervice, I conceive to be one great and e&s;&s;ential part of my duty to them and my&s;elf.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Thur&s;day evening I had the honour to receive your two letters of the fourteenth in&s;tant. I am much obliged by the fre&s;h a&s;&s;urances which Congre&s;s are plea&s;ed to make me of their confidence; and they may be &s;atisfied that I wi&s;h nothing more ardently than that a good and perfect agreement &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t between us.</P>
<P>The negociation between the commi&s;&s;ioners is ended without effecting a cartel: nor do I &s;uppo&s;e, from the in|formation I have received on the &s;ubject, that there is any good pro&s;pect that one will ever be formed, or at lea&s;t for a great while, on a liberal and exten&s;ive plan. A report of the proceedings of the commi&s;&s;ioners on our part, at their &s;everal meetings, I take the liberty to inclo&s;e. The papers, N^o 1, contain the letters between general Howe and my|&s;elf, &s;tipulating the neutrality of Germantown,&mdash;our re|&s;pective powers,&mdash;and the re&s;ult of the meeting there;&mdash;N^o 2, the &s;ub&s;equent proceedings at Newtown. The old agreement, I pre&s;ume, continues; and under it we mu&s;t carry on exchanges.</P>
<P>General Muhlenberg has communicated his determina|tion to re&s;ign, but has promi&s;ed not to leave his brigade till Congre&s;s &s;hall appoint another general in his room, pro|vided it is done in any rea&s;onable time.</P>
<P>By po&s;tponing my call upon the militia, as mentioned in my la&s;t of the tenth, I did not mean to decline it altogeth|er. I did not &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of calling out five thou&s;and for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of defence: and, in the pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion of things, I cannot perceive my way &s;ufficiently clear for offen&s;ive mea&s;ures, as I do not know when to expect the recruits from the different States, nor what pro&s;pect the

<P>The inclo&s;ed draught of a bill was brought to Head-Quarters ye&s;terday afternoon, by a gentleman who informed me that a large cargo of them had been ju&s;t &s;ent out of Philadelphia. Whether this in&s;idious proceeding is genu|ine and imported in the packet which arrived a few days ago, or contrived in Philadelphia, is a point undetermined and immaterial; but it is certainly founded in principles of the mo&s;t * * *&mdash;meant to poi&s;on the minds of the people, and detach the wavering at lea&s;t from our cau&s;e. I &s;up|po&s;e it will obtain a place in the papers, and am not with|out anxiety that it will have a malignant influence. I would &s;ubmit it whether it will not be highly expedient for Congre&s;s to inve&s;tigate it in all its parts, and to expo&s;e in the mo&s;t &s;triking manner the inju&s;tice, delu&s;ion, and fraud, it contains.

<P>WITH your letter of the &s;eventeenth in&s;tant, and its inclo&s;ures, I was duly honoured on Saturday afternoon. When I addre&s;&s;ed you on the eighteenth, I was doubtful whether the draught of the bill then tran&s;mitted was not &s;purious and contrived in Philadelphia: but its authentici|ty, I am almo&s;t certain, is not to be que&s;tioned.

<P>I TAKE the liberty to tran&s;mit you a letter which I received ye&s;terday from governor Tryon, inclo&s;ing the draughts of the two bills I forwarded before, with his cer|tificate of the manner in which they came to his hands, ac|companied by his more extraordinary and impertinent re|que&s;t, that, through my means, the contents &s;hould be com|municated to the officers and men of this army. This engine of mini&s;try, from governor Living&s;ton's account, is very indu&s;triou&s;ly circulating copies of the&s;e draughts, in obedience to their and his royal ma&s;ter's mandates. The letter which I inclo&s;e, and a triplicate, came to hand at one time: &s;ome future conveyance, it is probable, will pre|&s;ent me the duplicate.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o take the liberty to inclo&s;e you the Evening Po&s;t, N^o 475, which governor Living&s;ton was &s;o obliging as to &s;end me ye&s;terday. Were we not fully &s;atisfied from our experience, that there are no artifices, no mea&s;ures too * * * for the enemy or their adherents to attempt in or|der to promote their views, we might be a&s;toni&s;hed at the daring confidence, in defiance of the opinion of the world, manife&s;ted in a publication in this paper, purporting to be a re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, of the twentieth of February. This proceeding is infamous to the la&s;t degree, and calculated to produce the mo&s;t baneful con&s;equences by exciting an op|po&s;ition in the people to our draughting &s;y&s;tem, and embar|ra&s;&s;ing at lea&s;t the only pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> mode now left us for rai&s;|ing men. I think it of great importance that the forgery &s;hould be announced in the mo&s;t public manner, and am the more induced to this opinion from governor Living|&s;ton's account of the di&s;agreeable operation it has had, and is &s;till likely to produce, if not contradicted. If it is, and with a few &s;trictures, I &s;hould hope that it will excite in the brea&s;ts of all our countrymen, a ju&s;t and generous con|tempt of the enemy, for &s;uch a dirty, wicked proceeding.</P>

<P>I BEG leave to inform Congre&s;s that the report of the commi&s;&s;ioners coming, according to intelligence received ye&s;terday by a per&s;on of Philadelphia, is confidently be|lieved; and it is there thought that they will very &s;oon ar|rive.

Lord Amher&s;t, admiral Keppel, and general Murray, are &s;aid to be the per&s;ons appointed; and it is likely they are ve&s;ted with both civil and military powers.

<P>I HAD the honour ye&s;terday afternoon to receive your letter of the twenty fourth, continued to the twenty-fifth, with its important inclo&s;ures. Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to accept my &s;incere thanks for the fre&s;h in&s;tance of confidence manife&s;ted in their re&s;olution of the twenty-third, and other proceedings; and they may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that whatever pow|ers are entru&s;ted to me &s;hall be invariably directed to pro|mote the intere&s;t of the&s;e States. If in any ca&s;e there &s;hould be a mi&s;application or a failure in the execution, it will be the effect of mi&s;take and not of de&s;ign.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take mea&s;ures for di&s;tributing the report of the committee on lord North's bills, and the re&s;olution of the twenty-third inviting delinquents to return to their allegi|ance and to the protection of the&s;e States. This proceed|ing appears to me founded in great good policy; and I &s;hould hope that it will be attended with many valuable con&s;equences:&mdash;but this can only be proved by the event.</P>
<P>Though I wi&s;h mo&s;t heartily for the aid of general Lee in council and upon every other occa&s;ion,&mdash;yet, as the time of his return is uncertain, or at lea&s;t it will be &s;everal days before it takes place,&mdash;and as it &s;eems to me that there is not a moment to lo&s;e in forming &s;ome general &s;y&s;tem for our operations,&mdash;I &s;hould think it inexpedient for general Gates to delay coming to camp till his arrival. After a plan is dige&s;ted, there will be a great deal of time expend|ed before things will be in a proper train for execution. The &s;ea&s;on is fa&s;t advancing; and the period which may be mo&s;t favourable for any de&s;igns we may form will pre&s;ently arrive.</P>
<P>I take the liberty to tran&s;mit an extract of a letter from general Heath, which will &s;hew Congre&s;s that he is pre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides for money.

<P>Baron De Steuben's length of &s;ervice in the fir&s;t military &s;chool in Europe, and his former rank, pointed him out as a per&s;on peculiarly qualified to be at the head of this de|partment.

I therefore propo&s;ed to him to undertake the office of in|&s;pector-general, which he agreed to with the greate&s;t cheer|fulne&s;s, and has performed the duties of it with a zeal and intelligence equal to our wi&s;hes. He has two ranks of in|&s;pectors under him: the lowe&s;t are officers charged with the in&s;pection of brigades, with the title of brigade-in&s;pect|ors: the others &s;uperintend &s;everal of the&s;e: they have written in&s;tructions relative to their &s;everal functions; and the manoeuvres which they are to practi&s;e are illu&s;trated by a company which the baron has taken the pains to train him&s;elf.</P>

<P>Upon the arrival of lieutenant-colonel Fleury in camp, as he was unemployed, and had exerci&s;ed the office of aide-major in France, the baron propo&s;ed to have him employed as an in&s;pector; in which I readily acquie&s;ced, as Congre&s;s had given him the rank and pay of lieutenant-colonel. There may be other foreign officers in continental pay, idle for want of being attached to &s;ome corps, of who&s;e &s;ervices we might avail our&s;elves in this way, which is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> method of di&s;po&s;ing of them, unle&s;s they could be formed into a di&s;tinct corps.</P>
<P>From the extraordinary fatigue and clo&s;e attention re|quired of the officers employed in the in&s;pector&s;hip, I did not think it ami&s;s to let them entertain hopes that Congre&s;s would allow &s;ome addition to the pay which they derive from their rank; and I take the the liberty of recommend|ing the mea&s;ure. I would propo&s;e twenty dollars per month for the brigade-in&s;pectors, and thirty for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he in&s;pect|ors, in addition to their pay in the line.</P>
<P>I &s;hould do inju&s;tice if I were to be longer &s;ilent with regard to the merits of the baron De Steuben. His knowl|edge of his prof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ion, added to the zeal which he has di&s;|covered &s;ince be began upon the functions of his office, lead me to con&s;ider him as an acqui&s;ition to the &s;ervice, and to recommend him to the attention of Congre&s;s. His expec|tations with regard to rank extend to that of major-general. His finances, he ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;es, will not admit of his &s;erving without the incident emoluments; and Congre&s;s, I pre&s;ume, from his character and their own knowledge of him, will without difficulty gratify him in the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P>The baron is &s;en&s;ible that our &s;ituation requires a few variations in the duties of his office from the general prac|tice in Europe, and particularly that they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be more comprehen&s;ive; in which, as well as in his in&s;truc|tions

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN a late letter from general Schuyier, I received the proceedings of a board of commi&s;&s;ioners for Indian affairs, held at Albany the fifteenth of la&s;t month. It appears by them and &s;ome other accounts I have &s;een, that there is but little pro&s;pect of &s;ucceeding in the plan for engaging a body of Indians from that quarter to &s;erve with this army. The advantage which the enemy po&s;&s;e&s;s over us, in having the means of making pre&s;ents much more liberally than we can, has made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon their minds, and &s;eems to be more than a counterbalance for any arguments we can offer to conciliate their attachment. They al&s;o appear to be apprehen&s;ive for their own &s;afety, and rather to wi&s;h for aid and protection from us, than willing to leave their habitations and come to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ure propo&s;ed was by way of experiment, as one which might po&s;&s;ibly be attended with valuable con&s;e|quences, and, if it, could have been effected without much difficulty, might have been worth a trial. But, as the &s;cheme does not well corre&s;pond with their pre&s;ent di&s;po|&s;ition, and may &s;erve to increa&s;e our embarra&s;&s;ments in
<PB N="255" REF="029737_0593_0FE29CEA57C57AD0">
keeping them even in tolerable good humour, I am inclined to think it would be mo&s;t advi&s;eable to relinqui&s;h the attempt. They may be told of what has happened in Europe, with proper embelli&s;hments, and that our affairs are now upon &s;uch a footing as to render their aid in the field unnece&s;&s;ary, and that all we require of them is their friend&s;hip and good wi&s;hes. This and promi&s;es of protection may have a pow|erful and happy effect.</P>
<P>It is of great importance to counteract the temptation held out by the enemy, and to &s;ecure the good will of the Indians, who appear to be at lea&s;t in a &s;tate of he&s;itancy and indeci&s;ion, if nothing wor&s;e.

<P>P. S. As to an equivalent in men for officers, that pro|po&s;ed by his commi&s;&s;ioners was too high. A much more moderate one was nearly agreed to between them and the gentlemen deputed by me, when they were in treaty. This mode of relief, at this in&s;tant, may not be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to adopt.

<P>I HAD the honour to receive in due time your &s;ev|eral favours of the third, &s;ixth, and ninth in&s;tant, with the papers to which they re&s;pectively alluded. After much con&s;ideration upon the &s;ubject, I have appointed general M^cInto&s;h to command at Fort-Pitt and in the we&s;tern country, for which he will &s;et out as &s;oon as he can accom|modate his affairs. I part with this gentleman with much reluctance, as I e&s;teem him an officer of great worth and merit, and as I know his &s;ervices here are and will be ma|terially wanted. His firm di&s;po&s;ition and equal ju&s;tice, his a&s;&s;iduity and good under&s;tanding,&mdash;added to his being a &s;tranger to all parties in that quarter,&mdash;pointed him out as a proper per&s;on; and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> exten&s;ive advantages will be derived from his command, which I could wi&s;h was more agreeable. He will wait on Congre&s;s for their in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>As lieutenant-colonel Sutherland, major Agnew, and lieutenant Poe, have only reque&s;ted to go to Europe on
<PB N="257" REF="029737_0595_0FE29CED98ED5518">
parole, it does not appear to me that I can with propriety apply to general Howe for their exchange:&mdash;this would imply that they were pri&s;oners of war. Though their ex|change is certainly the mo&s;t de&s;irable mode of relea&s;e, as it would relieve an equal number of our officers from captiv|ity, yet I &s;hould be happy if a negociation for the purpo&s;e &s;hould commence on their part. Knowing that it would be our intere&s;t to exchange all the officers of general Bur|goyne's army if it could be done, I wrote general Heath not long &s;ince, to take occa&s;ion to mention to them that we &s;hould always be willing to accede to any equal propo&s;itions for that purpo&s;e, and would carefully convey their applica|tions to Sir William Howe or the general who might com|mand the Briti&s;h army. I take the liberty to return their letters, pre&s;uming that Congre&s;s may incline to give them &s;ome an&s;wer, either directly, or through general Heath.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to lieutenant-colonel * * *, I do not find that there is any nece&s;&s;ity for granting the prayer of his petition: we have already too many officers: and I do not appre|hend the intere&s;t of the States would be much promoted in his appointment. If he could make up two or three com|panies, they would be of pri&s;oners and de&s;erters, who would mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly embrace an early opportunity to go off with their arms and clothing. I am di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ider him as a man of &s;ome addre&s;s and policy, as he is aiming at a con|firmation in the line of the army (by obtaining an appoint|ment to a new corps) of the rank which he had as a divi&s;ion quarter-ma&s;ter. Be&s;ides the impolicy of augmenting the number of our officers where it is not really e&s;&s;ential, &s;uch a promotion would give di&s;&s;atisfaction; and I &s;uppo&s;e there are few officers, if any, who formerly commanded Mr. * * * in the line of the army, that would &s;ubmit to his orders.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from general Dickin&s;on to me will inform Congre&s;s of the fate of the continental frig|ates in Delaware,&mdash;a fate (in the &s;ituation they were left) I had long predicted, and which I had taken much pains to avert, by u&s;ing every argument in my power to have them &s;unk. In that ca&s;e, their de&s;truction would have been at lea&s;t a work of time, difficulty and expen&s;e, and might have been perhaps prevented. About one o'clock on Thur&s;day
<PB N="258" REF="029737_0596_0FE29C8E097B98D8">
I got notice of an intended move of the enemy by water; and, conjecturing the de&s;tination of it, had a detachment under general Maxwell (who&s;e tour of duty it was) ready to march towards the Delaware by four o'clock: but a heavy rain prevented their moving till next morning.</P>
<P>I have been happy in the exchange, and a vi&s;it from lieu|tenant-colonel Allen. His fortitude and firmne&s;s &s;eem to have placed him out of the reach of misfortune. There is an original &s;omething in him that commands admiration; and his long captivity and &s;ufferings have only &s;erved to in|crea&s;e if po&s;&s;ible his enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal. He appears very de|&s;irous of rendering his &s;ervices to the States, and of being employed, and at the &s;ame time does not di&s;cover any am|bition for high rank. Congre&s;s will herewith receive a letter from him; and I doubt not they will make &s;uch pro|vi&s;ion for him as they may think proper and &s;uitable.</P>
<P>I take plea&s;ure in tran&s;mitting a Philadelphia paper of the ninth, which came to hand ye&s;terday evening, contain|ing a me&s;&s;age from his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty to the court of London in con&s;equence of the treaty between him and the&s;e States,&mdash;and his Britannic maje&s;ty's addre&s;s to the lords and commons, &amp;c. The me&s;&s;age is conceived in terms of irony and deri&s;ion, more degrading to the pride and dignity of Britain than any thing &s;he has ever expe|rienced &s;ince &s;he has been a nation.

the unea&s;ine&s;&s;es which have been &s;o extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing, and prevent re&s;ignations, which had proceeded, and were likely to be at &s;uch a height, as to de&s;troy our whole military &s;y&s;tem.

<P>The letter and brevet for colonel Allen I will tran&s;mit by the fir&s;t opportunity. He left camp eight days ago.</P>
<P>From a variety of concurring circum&s;tances, and the uni|form report of per&s;ons who have left Philadelphia within four days pa&s;t, it would appear that the enemy mean to evac|uate the city. It is &s;aid they have already embarked a part of their heavy cannon and baggage,&mdash;that tran&s;ports are fitted and fitting for their hor&s;e, and taking in hay. The accounts further add that there has been a pre&s;s for &s;ome nights in the city, and &s;everal men obtained in this way, and carried aboard &s;hip; al&s;o that there had been an increa&s;ed number of vendues. The&s;e circum&s;tances all indicate an evacuation: but I have not been able to learn the objects of their future operations. I wrote to general Gates ye&s;terday upon the &s;ubject, that he may be prepared in the be&s;t manner the &s;ituation of things will admit, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be de&s;tined for the North-river,&mdash;and de&s;ired him to retain for the pre&s;ent all the ea&s;tern recruits intend|ed for this army.</P>

<P>A valuable detachment, under the command of the mar|quis Fayette, marched this morning, which is intended to move between the Delaware and Schuylkill, for re&s;training the enemy's parties, procuring intelligence, and to act as circum&s;tances may require.</P>
<P>I cannot help feeling for the pri&s;oners in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy.

<P>LIEUTENANT-colonel John Gib&s;on, of the &s;ixth Virginia regiment, who, from his knowledge of the we&s;tern country, and Indian nations and language, is ordered to repair to Pitt&s;burg, will have the honour of delivering you this.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour to receive your favour of the twenty-fifth in&s;tant by doctor Scudder, and that of the twenty-ninth, ye&s;terday afternoon, with the inclo&s;ures and packet to which they referred.</P>
<P>I &s;hall inform major Lee of the new arrangement of his corps, and will appoint the officers required. Major Beatty is not in camp. The letter addre&s;&s;ed to him &s;hall be &s;ent by the fir&s;t opportunity to Princeton, where I pre&s;ume he will be found. That for captain Smith is already di&s;|patched to him.</P>
<P>The enemy are yet in Philadelphia, though the whole chain of information for &s;everal days pa&s;t afforded grounds to believe that they would have evacuated it before now. I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e they are nearly prepared to do it, though the removal of the &s;tores and baggage of &s;o large an army requires con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 1. I &s;hould be glad to know, in ca&s;e Philadelphia is evacuated, whether any and what line of conduct is to be pur&s;ued re&s;pecting the goods that may be left. Such articles as come under the denomination of public &s;tores will of cour&s;e be taken by the proper officers for the u&s;e of the States. The point on which I wi&s;h direction is with re&s;pect to goods and merchandi&s;e, private property.
<PB N="263" REF="029737_0601_0FE29CFBB1794498">
I do not know whether any con&s;iderable quantity may be left: but, it has been &s;ugge&s;ted, that, from an expectation of the &s;ort, there are &s;ome bringing into light their gold and &s;ilver for the purpo&s;e of buying up. If there &s;hould be clothing &s;uitable for the army, perhaps there might be nothing unju&s;t in the public's taking the preference, and Congre&s;s appointing one or two intelligent active per&s;ons of addre&s;s, acquainted with the city and with tho&s;e who have the goods, with proper powers to purcha&s;e them.</P>
<P>Whatever mea&s;ure may be thought expedient, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to adopt it as early as po&s;&s;ible, as the evacua|tion will probably take place in a &s;hort time. Robert Morris, e&s;quire, I &s;hould imagine, if the purcha&s;ing &s;cheme is determined on, will be able to point out proper per&s;ons. Some gentlemen have mentioned me&s;&s;ieurs Samuel Howell and Thomas Franklyn as well qualified both an account of their integrity and attachment to our cau&s;e, and from their knowledge of the city and re&s;idence in it ever &s;ince the enemy had the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>I BEG leave to inform you, that, agreeably to the re&s;olutions tran&s;mitted in your favour of the thirty-fir&s;t ul|timo, I &s;hall undertake the reform of the North-Carolina battalions in camp as &s;oon as circum&s;tances will admit.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely wi&s;h the legi&s;latures of the &s;everal States had pa&s;&s;ed laws adopting the generous policy recommended by Congre&s;s in their re&s;olution of the twenty-third of April. I am a&s;&s;ured by authority not to be que&s;tioned, that, for want of this, hundreds, nay, thou&s;ands of people, and among them many valuable artizans with large quantities of goods, will be forced from Philadelphia, who otherwi&s;e would willingly remain. From report, their reluctance and di&s;tre&s;s upon this occa&s;ion are &s;carcely to be paralleled. There are a few who&s;e conduct has been &s;uch, that no a&s;|&s;urances of &s;ecurity, I pre&s;ume, could induce them to &s;tay:

and their departure, compelled and founded as it were in the approbation of their own con&s;ciences, would an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of example, e&s;pecially if followed by a con|fi&s;cation of property. A pro&s;cribing &s;y&s;tem, or laws hav|ing the &s;ame effect, when carried to a great extent, ever appeared to me to be impolitic: and their operation &s;hould always cea&s;e with the cau&s;es which produced them. Ex|amples in terrorem are nece&s;&s;ary: but to exile many of its inhabitants cannot be the intere&s;t of any State.</P>

<P>I &s;hall take every mea&s;ure in my power to prevent an intercour&s;e between the army and the enemy, and al&s;o be|tween the inhabitants and the latter. You may re&s;t a&s;|&s;ured that whatever letters come from their lines &s;hall be, as they ever have been, minutely in&s;pected; and when|ever they import any thing of an in&s;idious ca&s;t, they &s;hall be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. In this I tru&s;t I &s;hall not offend again&s;t any rule of right, nor the &s;tricte&s;t propriety.</P>
<P>The letter for the commi&s;&s;ioners I &s;hall tran&s;mit by the earlie&s;t opportunity: however, their departure from Phila|delphia will prevent their getting it as &s;oon as they other|wi&s;e would have done. I cannot &s;ay that I regret the delay: for there is no knowing to what acts of depreda|tion and ruin their di&s;appointed ambition might have led. And permit me to add that I think there was no other criterion for Congre&s;s to go by, than the one they have adopted. The proceedings of the twenty-&s;econd of April, it is probable, have reached Britain by this time, and will &s;hew that the pre&s;ent powers of the commi&s;&s;ioners,&mdash;or at lea&s;t tho&s;e we are obliged to &s;uppo&s;e them to po&s;&s;e&s;s,&mdash;are wholly incompetent to any valuable end.</P>
<P>I have appointed general Arnold to command in Phila|delphia, as the &s;tate of his wound will not permit his &s;er|vices in a more active line. Colonel Jack&s;on, with a detachment of troops, is to attend him: and I flatter my|&s;elf that order will be pre&s;erved, and the &s;everal purpo&s;es an&s;wered, expre&s;&s;ed by Congre&s;s in their re&s;olution of the fourth in&s;tant.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS duly honoured with your favour of the twen|tieth in&s;tant, with the report to which it referred, and tru&s;t my &s;ituation will apologize for my not an&s;wering it before.</P>
<P>I am now here with the main body of the army, and pre&s;&s;ing hard to come up with the enemy. They encamp|ed ye&s;terday at Monmouth court-hou&s;e, having almo&s;t the whole of their front, particularly their left wing, &s;ecured by a mar&s;h and thick wood, and their rear by a difficult defile, from whence they moved very early this morning. Our advance, from the rainy weather, and the inten&s;e heat when it was fair, (though the&s;e may have been equally di&s;advan|tageous to them) has been greatly delayed. Several of our men have fallen &s;ick from the&s;e cau&s;es; and a few unfor|tunately have fainted, and died in a little time after.</P>
<P>We have a &s;elect and &s;trong detachment more forward, under the command of major-general Lee, with orders to attack their rear if po&s;&s;ible. Whether the detachment will be able to come up with it, is a matter of que&s;tion, e&s;pecial|ly before they get into &s;trong grounds. Be&s;ides this, Mor|gan, with his corps, and &s;ome bodies of militia, are on their flanks.</P>
<P>I cannot determine yet at what place they intend to em|bark. Some think they will pu&s;h for Sandy-Hook, whil&s;t others &s;uppo&s;e they mean to go to Shoal-harbour. The latter opinion &s;eems to be founded in the greater probabil|ity, as, from intelligence, &s;everal ve&s;&s;els and craft are lying off that place.</P>
<P>We have made a few pri&s;oners; and they have lo&s;t a good many men by de&s;ertion. I cannot a&s;certain their number, as they came in to our advanced parties, and pu&s;hed immediately into the country. I think five or &s;ix hundred is the lea&s;t number that have come in, in the whole. They are chiefly foreigners.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honour to inform you, that, about &s;even o'clock ye&s;terday morning, both armies advanced on each other. About twelve, they met on the grounds near Monmouth court-hou&s;e, when an action commenced. We forced the enemy from the field, and encamped on the ground.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I EMBRACE this fir&s;t moment of lei&s;ure to give Congre&s;s a more full and particular account of the move|ments of the army under my command &s;ince its pa&s;&s;ing the Delaware, than the &s;ituation of our affairs would heretofore permit.</P>
<P>I had the honour to advi&s;e them, that, on the appearances of the enemy's intention to march through Jer&s;ey be|coming &s;erious, I had detached general Maxwell's brigade in conjunction with the militia of that State to interrupt and impede their progre&s;s by every ob&s;truction in their power, &s;o as to give time to the army under my command to come up with them, and take advantage of any favourable cir|cum&s;tances that might pre&s;ent them&s;elves. The army hav|ing proceeded to Coryel's ferry and cro&s;&s;ed the Delaware at that place, I immediately detached colonel Morgan with a &s;elect corps of &s;ix hundred men to reinforce general Max|well, and marched with the main body towards Princeton.</P>
<P>The &s;low advance of the enemy had greatly the air of de|&s;ign, and led me, with others, to &s;u&s;pect that general Clin|ton, de&s;irous of a general action, was endeavouring to draw us down into the lower country, in order, by a rapid move|ment,
<PB N="274" REF="029737_0612_0FE29CAC8E8C49F8">
to gain our right, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;trong grounds above us. This con&s;ideration, and to give the troops time to repo&s;e and refre&s;h them&s;elves from the fa|tigues they had experienced from rainy and exce&s;&s;ive hot weather, determined me to halt at Hopewell town&s;hip about five miles from Princeton, where we remained till the morning of the twenty-fifth.</P>
<P>On the preceding day I made a &s;econd detachment of fifteen hundred cho&s;en troops under brigadier-general Scott, to reinforce tho&s;e already in the vicinity of the enemy, the more effectually to annoy and delay their march. The next day the army moved to King&s;ton; and having receiv|ed intelligence that the enemy were pro&s;ecuting their route towards Monmouth court-hou&s;e, I di&s;patched a thou&s;and &s;elect men under brigadier-general Wayne, and &s;ent the marquis De la Fayette to take the command of the whole advanced corps, including Maxwell's brigade and Morgan's light infantry, with orders to take the fir&s;t fair opportunity of attacking the enemy's rear.</P>
<P>In the evening of the &s;ame day, the whole army march|ed from King&s;ton, where our baggage was left, with inten|tion to pre&s;erve a proper di&s;tance for &s;upporting the advanc|ed corps, and arrived at Cranberry early the next morning. The inten&s;e heat of the weather, and a heavy &s;torm un|luckily coming on, made it impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;ume our march that day without great inconvenience and injury to the troops. Our advanced corps, being differently circum|&s;tanced, moved from the po&s;ition it had held the night be|fore, and took po&s;t in the evening on the Monmouth road about five miles from the enemy's rear, in expectation of at|tacking them next morning on their march. The main body having remained at Cranberry, the advanced corps was found to be too remote, and too far upon the right, to be &s;upported, in ca&s;e of an attack either upon or from the enemy; which induced me to &s;end orders to the marquis to file off by his left towards Engli&s;htown, which he accordingly executed early in the morning of the twenty-&s;eventh.</P>
<P>The enemy, in marching from Allentown, had changed their di&s;po&s;ition, and placed their be&s;t troops in the rear, con&s;i&s;ting of all the grenadiers, light infantry, and cha&s;&s;eurs
<PB N="275" REF="029737_0613_0FE29D0E0398BEF0">
of the line. This alteration made it nece&s;&s;ary to increa&s;e the number of our advanced corps; in con&s;equence of which, I detached major-general Lee with two brigades to join the marquis at Engli&s;htown, on whom of cour&s;e the command of the whole devolved, amounting to about five thou&s;and men. The main body marched the &s;ame day, and encamped within three miles of that place. Morgan's corps was left hovering on the enemy's right flank; and the Jer&s;ey militia, amounting at this time to about &s;even or eight hundred men, under general Dickin&s;on, on their left.</P>
<P>The enemy were now encamped in a &s;trong po&s;ition, with their right extending about a mile and a half beyond the court-hou&s;e in the parting of the roads leading to Shrew&s;|bury and Middletown, and their left along the road from Allentown to Monmouth, about three miles on this &s;ide the court-hou&s;e. Their right flank lay on the &s;kirt of a &s;mall wood, while their left was &s;ecured by a very thick one,&mdash;a mora&s;s running towards their rear, and their whole front covered by a wood, and, for a con&s;iderable extent towards the left, with a mora&s;s. In this &s;ituation they halted till the morning of the twenty-eighth.</P>
<P>Matters being thus &s;ituated,&mdash;and having had the be&s;t information, that, if the enemy were once arrived at the heights of Middletown, ten or twelve miles from where they were, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to attempt any thing again&s;t them with a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s,&mdash;I determined to attack their rear the moment they &s;hould get in motion from their pre&s;ent ground. I communicated my intention to general Lee, and ordered him to make his di&s;po&s;ition for the attack, and to keep his troops con&s;tantly lying upon their arms, to be in readine&s;s at the &s;horte&s;t notice. This was done with re&s;pect to the troops under my immediate command.</P>
<P>About <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ive in the morning, general Dickin&s;on &s;ent an expre&s;s informing that the front of the enemy had begun their march. I in&s;tantly put the army in motion, and &s;ent orders by one of my aides to general Lee to move on and attack them unle&s;s there &s;hould be very powerful rea&s;ons to the contrary&mdash;acquainting him at the &s;ame time, that I was marching to &s;upport him, and, for doing it
<PB N="276" REF="029737_0614_0FE29CAE12E3B180">
with the greater expedition and convenience, &s;hould make the men di&s;encumber them&s;elves of their packs and blankets.</P>
<P>After marching about five miles, to my great &s;urpri&s;e and mortification, I met the whole advanced corps retreat|ing,&mdash;and, as I was told, by general Lee's orders,&mdash;with|out having made any oppo&s;ition, except one fire, given by a party under the command of colonel Butler, on their being charged by the enemy's cavalry, who were repul&s;ed. I proceeded immediately to the rear of the corps, which I found clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed by the enemy, and gave directions for forming part of the retreating troops, who, by the brave and &s;pirited conduct of the officers, aided by &s;ome pieces of well &s;erved artillery, checked the enemy's advance, and gave time to make a di&s;po&s;ition of the left wing and &s;econd line of the army upon an eminence, and in a wood a little in the rear, covered by a mora&s;s in front. On this were placed &s;ome batteries of cannon by lord Stirling who com|manded the left wing, which played upon the enemy with great effect, and, &s;econded by parties of infantry detached to oppo&s;e them, effectually put a &s;top to their advance.</P>
<P>General Lee being detached with the advanced corps, the command of the right wing, for the occa&s;ion, was given to general Greene. For the expedition of the march, and to counteract any attempt to turn our right, I had ordered him to file off by the new church, two miles from En|gli&s;htown, and fall into the Monmouth road, a &s;mall di&s;tance in the rear of the court-hou&s;e, while the re&s;t of the column moved directly on towards the court-hou&s;e. On intelli|gence of the retreat, he marched up and took a very ad|vantageous po&s;ition on the right.</P>
<P>The enemy, by this time, finding them&s;elves warmly oppo&s;ed in front, made an attempt to turn our left flank: but they were bravely repul&s;ed and driven back by detach|ed parties of infantry. They al&s;o made a movement to our right with as little &s;ucce&s;s, general Greene having ad|vanced a body of troops with artillery to a commanding piece of ground; which not only di&s;appointed their de&s;ign of turning our right, but &s;everely enfiladed tho&s;e in front of the left wing. In addition to this, general Wayne advan|ced with a body of troops, and kept up &s;o &s;evere and well-directed
<PB N="277" REF="029737_0615_0FE29D10F01F7540">
a fire, that the enemy were &s;oon compelled to re|tire behind the defile where the fir&s;t &s;tand in the beginning of the action had been made.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation the enemy had both their flanks &s;ecured by thick woods and mora&s;&s;es, while their front could only be approached through a narrow pa&s;s. I re&s;olved never|thele&s;s to attack them; and, for that purpo&s;e, ordered general Poor, with his own and the Carolina brigade, to move round upon their right, and general Woodford upon their left, and the artillery to gall them in front. But the impediments in their way prevented their getting within reach before it was dark. They remained upon the ground they had been directed to occupy during the night, with intention to begin the attack early the next morning; and the army continued lying upon their arms in the field of action to be in readine&s;s to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>In the mean time the enemy were employed in remov|ing their wounded, and about twelve o'clock at night marched away in &s;uch &s;ilence, that, though general Poor lay extremely near them, they effected their retreat without his knowledge. They carried off all their wounded, ex|cept four officers and about forty privates who&s;e wounds were too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">angerous to permit their removal.</P>
<P>The extreme heat of the weather, the fatigue of the men from their march through a deep &s;andy country al|mo&s;t entirely de&s;titute of water, and the di&s;tance the ene|my had gained by marching in the night, made a pur&s;uit impracticable and fruitle&s;s: it would have an&s;wered no valuable purpo&s;e, and would have been fatal to numbers of our men, &s;everal of whom died the preceding day with heat.</P>
<P>Were I to conclude my account of this day's tran&s;ac|tions without expre&s;&s;ing my obligations to the officers of the army in general, I &s;hould do inju&s;tice to their merit, and violence to my own feelings. They &s;eemed to vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> with each other in manife&s;ting their zeal and bravery. The catalogue of tho&s;e who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves is too long to admit of particularizing individuals. I cannot, however, forbear mentioning brigadier-general Wayne, who&s;e good conduct and bravery through the whole action de&s;erves particular commendation.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="029737_0616_0FE29CB0E7F468A8">
The behaviour of the troops in general, after they re|covered from the fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e occa&s;ioned by the retreat of the advanced corps, was &s;uch as could not be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed. All the artillery, both officers and men, that were engag|ed, di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in a remarkable manner.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed, Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to receive a return of our killed, wounded, and mi&s;&s;ing. Among the first were lieutenant-colonel Bunner of Penn&s;ylvania, and major Dickin&s;on of Virginia, both officers of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit, and much to be regretted. The enemy's &s;lain, left on the field, and buried by us, according to the return of the per|&s;ons a&s;&s;igned to that duty, were four officers and two hun|dred and forty-five privates. In the former number was the honourable colonel Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">kton. Exclu&s;ive of the&s;e, they buried &s;ome them&s;elves, as there were &s;everal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> graves near the field of battle. How many men they may have had wounded, cannot be determined: but, from the u&s;ual proportion, the number mu&s;t have been con&s;iderable. There were a few pri&s;oners taken.</P>
<P>The peculiar &s;ituation of general Lee at this time re|quires that I &s;hould &s;ay nothing of his conduct. He is now in arre&s;t. The charges again&s;t him, with &s;uch &s;en|tence as the court-martial may decree in his ca&s;e, &s;hall be tran&s;mitted for the approbation or di&s;approbation of Con|gre&s;s, as &s;oon as it &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Being fully convinced by the gentlemen of this country that the enemy cannot be hurt or injured in their embark|ation at Sandy-Hook, the place to which they are going,&mdash;and unwilling to get too far removed from the North-river,&mdash;I put the troops in motion early this morning, and &s;hall proceed that way, leaving the Jer&s;ey brigade, Mor|gan's corps, and other light parties (the militia being all di&s;mi&s;&s;ed) to hover about them, to countenance de&s;ertion, and to prevent their depredations as far as po&s;&s;ible. After they embark, the former will take po&s;t in the neighbour|hood of Elizabethtown, the latter rejoin the corps from which they were detached.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you on the fourteenth, I have been favoured with your letters of the eleventh and &s;eventeenth, with their re&s;pective inclo&s;ures. The next morning after the receipt of the former which came to hand on the &s;eventeenth, I di&s;patched lieutenant-colonel Hamilton, another of my aides, with the be&s;t pi|lots and the mo&s;t &s;kilful ma&s;ters of &s;hips I could procure, to admiral count D'E&s;taing, to conver&s;e with him more f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lly on the &s;ubject of his operations, than I was able to direct lieutenant-colonel Laurens to do for want of the information which I afterwards obtained from major Chouin, and a knowledge in &s;everal other points be&s;ides.</P>
<P>On Sunday night Mr. Laurens returned; and I found by him that it was the count's fir&s;t wi&s;h to enter at Sandy-Hook, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of, or to de&s;troy, if po&s;|&s;ible, the whole of the Briti&s;h fleet lying in the bay of New-York; and that, for this purpo&s;e, he had been much engaged in his inquiries about the depth of water, and in &s;ounding the channel to a&s;certain it; the re&s;ult of which was, that the water, from the experiments made, was too &s;hallow at the entrance to admit his large &s;hips,&mdash;or, if they could be got in, it appeared that it would not be without a great deal of difficulty and ri&s;k. After this di&s;appointment, the next important object which &s;eemed to pre&s;ent it&s;elf was an attempt again&s;t Rhode-I&s;land, which the count in|clined to make (unle&s;s I &s;hould advi&s;e the contrary) as &s;oon as the Chimere frigate, which had carried his excellency mon&s;ieur Girard into the Delaware, &s;hould rejoin him.</P>
<P>Lieutenant-colonel Hamilton, who was well informed of our &s;ituation and of my &s;entiments on every point, was in|&s;tructed to give the admiral a full and accurate &s;tate of facts, and to acquaint him what aid and how far we could

co-operate with him in ca&s;e of an attempt either again&s;t New-York or Rhode-I&s;land; and al&s;o to obtain his ideas of the plan and &s;y&s;tem which he might think ought to be pur&s;ued, and to agree with him on certain &s;ignals.</P>
<P>Previous to my di&s;patching Mr. Hamilton, from the in|formation I received on my inquiries re&s;pecting the navi|gation at the Hook, I was led to &s;u&s;pect (however inter|e&s;ting and de&s;irable the de&s;truction or capture of the Briti&s;h fleet might be) that it was not &s;ufficient to introduce the count's &s;hips. Under this apprehen&s;ion, I wrote general Sullivan on the &s;eventeenth by expre&s;s, that an expedition might take place in a &s;hort time again&s;t Rhode-I&s;land, and urged him at the &s;ame time to apply to the States of Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts, Rhode-I&s;land and Connecticut, for as many men as would augment his force to five thou&s;and, and al&s;o to make every po&s;&s;ible preparation of boats, provi&s;ion, pilots, &amp;c. as if the event was fixed and certain.</P>
<P>From this time till about twelve o'clock on Sunday, the troops continued pa&s;&s;ing the river, when I cro&s;&s;ed with the la&s;t divi&s;ion. On Monday afternoon I arrived at this place, in the neighbourhood of which, the right and left wing encamped that night, with the &s;econd line a few miles in their rear. And here I am happy to add that their pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s the river was effected without any ac|cident, or without any more delay than nece&s;&s;arily attend|ed the work.</P>
<P>Being per&s;uaded now, from the conver&s;ation which I have had with &s;everal pilots and ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els, of char|acter, as well as from the accounts of other gentlemen, and colonel Laurens's report on his return, that the pa&s;&s;ing of the count's &s;hips by the Hook would be extremely preca|rious, if not impracticable,&mdash;I determined ye&s;terday (which was as &s;oon as it could be done) without waiting for fur|ther intelligence upon the &s;ubject, to put two brigades un|der marching orders. They accordingly marched this morning at two o'clock, for Rhode I&s;land, under the par|ticular command of generals Varnum and Glover re&s;pect|ively, and both under the direction, for the pre&s;ent, of the marquis De la Fayette. A water conveyance was thought of and wi&s;hed for the ea&s;e of the troops: but, on con&s;id|eration of all circum&s;tances&punc; &s;uch as the difficulty of pro|viding

ve&s;&s;els, the change and precariou&s;ne&s;s of the winds, the ri&s;k from the enemy's &s;hips, &amp;c. their route by land was deemed by far the more eligible. The force with general Sullivan, from the be&s;t and late&s;t advice I have been able to obtain, is about three thou&s;and. A detach|ment under colonel Jack&s;on will follow Varnum's and Glover's brigades.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed papers, N^o 1, re&s;pecting eight per&s;ons &s;ent from Bennington, and ordered into the enemy's lines, came to hand ye&s;terday. About the &s;ame time I received a letter from governor Clinton, containing a petition by the pri&s;oners, and a letter from the committee of Albany, all r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mon&s;trating again&s;t the proceeding. As this is a matter in which I have no authority to act, nor in which I would wi&s;h to intermeddle, I take the liberty of referring it to Congre&s;s, that they may decide upon it. The pri&s;oners are at We&s;t-Point, and ordered to be detained there for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o take the liberty of tran&s;mitting to Con|gre&s;s a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from captain Gibbs, and of recommending him to their con&s;ideration. His letter was to have been &s;ent by the baron Steuben before we marched from Valley-Forge: but his declining to go to Yorktown at that time, and our move through the Jer&s;eys, delayed its being done. The captain has been in the army from the commence|ment of the war, and in the capacities which he mentions. When Congre&s;s were plea&s;ed to honour me with the ap|pointment of officers for the &s;ixteen additional battalions, I offered to make &s;ome provi&s;ion for him: but this he de|clined, preferring to remain in my family. The guard he originally commanded con&s;i&s;ted of fifty men; but, &s;ince the arrival of baron Steuben, it has been augmented to a hundred and fifty. The baron advi&s;ed that there &s;hould be a &s;elect corps of this number to receive the manoeuvres in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and to act as a model to the army; and propo&s;ed that it &s;hould be formed of the old guard company, and draughts from the line. I pre&s;ume, if it &s;hould be Congre&s;s's plea&s;ure, a majority would be highly acceptable to the captain, and that it is as much as he expects.</P>
<P><HI>Eleven o'clock, P. M.</HI> I this moment received a letter from colonel Hamilton who is on his return to the army,
<PB N="284" REF="029737_0622_0FE29CBD256A27D0">
dated the twentieth at Black-Point. He informs that the count D'E&s;taing would &s;ail the next evening for Rhode-I&s;land, being convinced from actual &s;oundings that he could not enter his &s;hips. He was anxiou&s;ly waiting the arrival of the Chimere, but, at all events, meant to &s;ail at the time he mentions. The admiral has agreed on &s;ignals with Mr. Hamilton. Immediately after this letter came to hand, my aide, Mr. Laurens, &s;et out for Providence, having many things to communicate to general Sullivan upon the &s;ubject of his co-operation, which neither time nor propriety would &s;uffer me to commit to paper. Gen|eral Sullivan is directed not to confine the number of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">oops to five thou&s;and, but to augment it, if he &s;hall judge it nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;ure his &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>I was informed by Mr. Laurens, that the count D'E&s;|taing's magazine of bread is not &s;o large as we could wi&s;h, and that in the cour&s;e of a few weeks he will be in want. This circum&s;tance I thought it right to mention: and I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that any quantity of bi&s;cuit may be provided in a little time at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ures, N^o 2, are copies of three letters from my&s;elf to the admiral. I flatter my&s;elf the pre&s;ent of &s;tock, which I directed for him, on his fir&s;t arrival, in behalf of the States, will be approved by Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The accounts from the we&s;tern frontiers of Tryon coun|ty are di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. The &s;pirit of the &s;avages &s;eems to be rou&s;ed, and they appear determined on mi&s;chief and havoc in every quarter. By a letter from governor Clinton, of the twenty-fir&s;t, they have de&s;troyed Springfield and An|dreas town, and are marching towards the &s;ettlements on the we&s;t branch of the Delaware. The&s;e incur&s;ions are extremely embarra&s;&s;ing to our other affairs, and I think will ju&s;tify a conclu&s;ion that Sir Henry Clinton's intention was to operate up the North-river. Whether it may have changed with circum&s;tances, cannot be determined.</P>
<P>I have detached the fourth Penn&s;ylvania regiment and the remains of Morgan's corps, under lieutenant-colonel Butler, and al&s;o colonel Graham with a York State regi|ment, to co-operate with the militia, and to check the In|dians if po&s;&s;ible.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE baron De Steuben will have the honour of delivering you this. I am extremely &s;orry that this gen|tleman's &s;ituation and views &s;eem to have determined him to quit the &s;ervice, in which he has been heretofore and is capable &s;till of being exten&s;ively u&s;eful. Some di&s;contents, which aro&s;e among the officers on account of the powers with which the office was at fir&s;t ve&s;ted, induced me to ar|range the duties of it upon a plan different from that on which it began. The moving &s;tate of the army has for &s;ome time pa&s;t, in a great degree, &s;u&s;pended the exerci&s;e of the in&s;pectorate. When the troops marched from Brun&s;|wic, the &s;carcity of general officers,&mdash;mo&s;t of them being engaged with the court-martial either as members or wit|ne&s;&s;es,&mdash;occa&s;ioned my giving the baron a temporary com|mand of a divi&s;ion during the march. On our arrival near our pre&s;ent encampment, I intended he &s;hould relin|qui&s;h this charge, and re&s;ume his former office, for which purpo&s;e a general order was accordingly i&s;&s;ued. But I find that he is entirely di&s;inclined to the mea&s;ure, and re|&s;olves not to continue in the &s;ervice unle&s;s he can hold an actual command in the line.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice concurring with inclination con&s;trains me to te&s;ti|fy, that the baron has in every in&s;tance di&s;charged the &s;ev|eral tru&s;ts repo&s;ed in him with great zeal and ability, &s;o as to give him the fulle&s;t title to my e&s;teem, as a brave, inde|fatigable, judicious and experienced officer. I regret there &s;hould be a nece&s;&s;ity that his &s;ervices &s;hould be lo&s;t to the army: at the &s;ame time I think it my duty explicitly to ob&s;erve to Congre&s;s, that his de&s;ire of having an actual and permanent command in the line cannot be complied with, without wounding the feelings of a number of officers who&s;e rank and merits give them every claim to attention; and that the doing it would be productive of much di&s;&s;atisfac|tion
<PB N="286" REF="029737_0624_0FE29CBEAD097EC8">
and exten&s;ive ill con&s;equences. This does not pro|ceed from any per&s;onal objections on the part of tho&s;e of|ficers again&s;t the baron:&mdash;on the contrary, mo&s;t of them, whom I have heard &s;peak of him, expre&s;s a high &s;en&s;e of his military worth. It proceeds from motives of another nature which are too obvious to need particular explana|tion, or may be &s;ummed up in this, that they conceive &s;uch a &s;tep would be injurious to their e&s;&s;ential rights and ju&s;t expectations. That this would be their way of thinking upon the &s;ubject, I am fully convinced, from the effect which the temporary command given him, even under cir|cum&s;tances &s;o peculiar as tho&s;e I have mentioned, produced: the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ymptoms of di&s;content appeared upon the occa&s;ion.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour of tran&s;mitting to Congre&s;s a copy of a letter from general Knox, and of &s;undry ob&s;er|vations and remarks on the ordnance e&s;tabli&s;hment of the eleventh of February, which I received about the time we marched from Valley-Forge. The&s;e would have been tran&s;mitted before, had it not been for the moving &s;tate of the army, and a variety of other objects which engro&s;&s;ed my attention. We have found by experience that &s;ome in|conveniences
<PB N="287" REF="029737_0625_0FE29D2A44A57018">
have re&s;ulted from the e&s;tabli&s;hment, which I conceive have proceeded principally from the total independ|ence of the commi&s;&s;ary-general of military &s;tores on the commanding officer of artillery. It &s;eems &s;ome alterations are nece&s;&s;ary: and what they &s;hall be, Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to determine.</P>
<P>It is not without reluctance that I am con&s;trained to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my importunities on the &s;ubject of the committee of ar|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">gement. The pre&s;ent un&s;ettled &s;tate of the army is productive of &s;o much di&s;&s;atisfaction and confu&s;ion, and of &s;uch a variety of di&s;putes, that almo&s;t the whole of my time is now employed in finding temporary and inade|quate expedients to quiet the minds of the officers, and keep bu&s;ine&s;s on a tolerable &s;ort of footing. Not an hour pa&s;&s;es without new applications and new complaints about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k: and, for want of a proper adju&s;tment of this and many other e&s;&s;ential points, our affairs are in a mo&s;t irk&s;ome and injurious train. We can &s;carcely form a court-mar|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> or parade a detachment in any in&s;tance, without a warm di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on the &s;ubject of precedence; and there are &s;ev|eral good officers now who are fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed to decline duty, to prevent di&s;putes, and their being commanded by oth|er who upon every principle are their inferiors, unle&s;s their having obtained commi&s;&s;ions before them (from the opportunities they had of making earlier applications, from local circum&s;tances) &s;hould be con&s;idered &s;ufficient to give them a &s;uperior claim. There are many other cau&s;es of di&s;|&s;atisfaction on this head: but I will not enter into a mi|nute relation of them. I &s;incerely wi&s;h that the gentlemen appointed, or &s;uch others as Congre&s;s may think proper to nominate for the occa&s;ion, would immediately repair to camp:&mdash;the pre&s;ent opportunity is favourable for reducing matters to &s;y&s;tem and order; and, from painful experience, I know there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for it.</P>
<P>I &s;hould al&s;o hope that Congre&s;s will excu&s;e me for mentioning again the nece&s;&s;ity there is for appointing &s;ome brigadiers. The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, by the re&s;ignation of gen|eral Learned, wants one: Penn&s;ylvania, as general Hand is not here, has but one with the army: Maryland, which has two large brigades in the field, has only general Small-wood; and the North-Carolina troops, &s;ince the departure
<PB N="288" REF="029737_0626_0FE29CCA9F281AD0">
of general M^cInto&s;h, have been without any. As I had taken the liberty upon a former occa&s;ion to offer my &s;enti|ments to Congre&s;s and their committee upon this &s;ubject, I &s;hould not trouble them now, if I was not more and more convinced that the &s;ervice required promotions in this line. The frequent changes which take place among the officers, where there are no brigadiers, are attended with great in|convenience and detriment; and they are an effectual bar to the introduction of di&s;cipline. In &s;uch ca&s;es, the officers know that their command is but temporary, always liable to cea&s;e; and therefore they do not find them&s;elves &s;uffi|ciently intere&s;ted to promote order and &s;ubordination; nor will the re&s;t look up to them with that re&s;pect and defer|ence which are e&s;&s;ential. Every day's experience proves this, and &s;hews beyond que&s;tion that the affairs of a brigade can never be in a right train without a brigadier or &s;ome general officer to direct them. It is certain the&s;e appoint|ments, at the fir&s;t view, will add a little to the li&s;t of expen&s;e: but in the end they will be a great &s;aving, and produce many important advantages. We are al&s;o a good deal di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at this time for major-generals. However, as this ari&s;es more from the peculiar circum&s;tances and &s;itu|ation of many which prevent them from duty in the line, than from a deficiency in the number appointed, I &s;hall not add upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>There is another branch of the army, which, in my opin|ion, calls loudly for the appointment of a general officer,&mdash;and this is the cavalry. For want of a proper regulating head in this corps, the whole has been in confu&s;ion, and of but very little &s;ervice; whereas, under a right management, it might be mo&s;t u&s;eful. The principal officers in it do not harmonize; which circum&s;tance, with their di&s;putes about rank, would (were there no other objections) effectually prevent the corps from rendering the public the &s;ervices they have a right to expect, and of which it &s;hould be ca|pable. To promote any gentlemen now in it to a general command, would not be acquie&s;ced in by the re&s;t&mdash;nor do I know that any of them wi&s;h it; and it would increa&s;e their mi&s;under&s;tanding, and, of cour&s;e, di&s;order.</P>
<P>I mean to draw all the hor&s;e immediately together, when I tru&s;t they will be under the direction of a general officer
<PB N="289" REF="029737_0627_0FE29D2BC8304870">
appointed by Congre&s;s for the purpo&s;e. Who he &s;hall be, will remain &s;olely with them to determine. However, I will take the liberty to add that he &s;hould be intelligent, active, attentive; and, as far as I can judge, general Cad|wallader or general Reed would fill the po&s;t with great honour and advantage; though it would &s;eem, from the &s;eat the latter has taken in Congre&s;s, and from his late appoint|ment to the council of Penn&s;ylvania, as if he had declined every military view. The abilities of the&s;e gentlemen, as well as their attachment, are generally known; and I am led to believe that either would be as acceptable to the corps as any per&s;on that can be found. Indeed I have learned as much from two of the colonels.</P>
<P>I have been waiting with the mo&s;t impatient anxiety to hear of count D'E&s;taing's arrival at Rhode-I&s;land; but as yet I have not been &s;o happy. My la&s;t intelligence from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hence is a letter from general Sullivan, dated at ten o'clock in the forenoon of the twenty-&s;eventh, when he had no advice of the fleet. He was in high &s;pirits; and, from the preparation in which matters were, he entertained the mo&s;t flattering hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in the intended enter|pri&s;e. The brigades of Varnum and Glover, with Jack|&s;on's detachment, would arrive, I expect, on the &s;econd in&s;tant.</P>
<P>As the army was encamped, and there was no great pro&s;|pect of a &s;udden removal, I judged it advi&s;eable to &s;end general Greene to the ea&s;tward on Wedne&s;day la&s;t, being fully per&s;uaded his &s;ervices, as well in the quarter-ma&s;ter line as in the field, would be of material importance in the expedition again&s;t the enemy in that quarter. He is inti|mately acquainted with the whole of that country, and be|&s;ides, he has an exten&s;ive intere&s;t and influence in it. And, in ju&s;tice to general Greene, I take occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve that the public is much indebted to him for his judicious management and active exertions in his pre&s;ent department. When he entered upon it, he found it in a mo&s;t confu&s;ed, di&s;tracted and de&s;titute &s;tate. This, by his conduct and indu&s;try, has undergone a very happy change, and &s;uch as enabled us with great facility to make a &s;udden move with the whole army and baggage from Valley-Forge in pur&s;uit of the enemy, and to perform a march to this place. In
<PB N="290" REF="029737_0628_0FE29CCC58E52370">
a word, he has given the mo&s;t general &s;atisfaction, and his affairs carry much the face of method and &s;y&s;tem. I al&s;o con&s;ider it as an act of ju&s;tice to &s;peak of the conduct of colonel Wad&s;worth, commi&s;&s;ary-general. He has been in|defatigable in his exertions to provide for the army; and, &s;ince his appointment, our &s;upplies of provi&s;ion have been good and ample.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 4. At &s;even o'clock in the evening ye&s;terday, I received the inclo&s;ed letter from general Sullivan, with one addre&s;&s;ed to my&s;elf, a copy of which I do my&s;elf the plea&s;|ure of forwarding. I am exceedingly happy in the count's arrival, and that things wear &s;o plea&s;ing an a&s;pect.</P>
<P>There is another &s;ubject on which I mu&s;t take the liber|ty of addre&s;&s;ing Congre&s;s, which is that of the clothier's department. I am perfectly &s;atisfied, that unle&s;s this very important and intere&s;ting office is put under better regula|tions, the army will never be clothed. * * * I believe both officers and men, particularly the latter, have &s;uffered greater inconveniences and di&s;tre&s;&s;es than &s;oldiers ever did before, for want of clothing; and that this has not flowed more from a real &s;carcity of articles, than a want of proper exertions and provident management to procure them. It is e&s;&s;ential that &s;omething &s;hould be done, and immediate|ly, to place the department on a better footing. We have now a great many men entirely de&s;titute of &s;hirts and breech|es, and I &s;uppo&s;e not le&s;s than a fourth or fifth of the whole here who are without &s;hoes. From the deficiencies in this line, numbers of de&s;ertions have proceeded,&mdash;not to men|tion deaths: and what is &s;till wor&s;e, the troops which re|main, and &s;ee them&s;elves in rags, want that &s;pirit and pride nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute the &s;oldier.</P>
<P>I have been informed by &s;everal officers, and by &s;uch as I can depend on, that many of the late draughts are willing and de&s;irous of enli&s;ting during the war. I do not con|ceive my&s;elf at liberty to give direction on the point, and therefore &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s to decide. However, if they can be engaged for the u&s;ual bounties allowed by the contin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">, after proper precautions are taken to prevent fraud, I think the mea&s;ure will be expedient. It is true, our affairs have an agreeable a&s;pect at pre&s;ent: but the war may continue, and we&mdash;want men. A third of the

time of &s;ome of them, and a half in the ca&s;e of others, is already expired; and as they will ri&s;e in their views, and become more difficult in proportion as their &s;ervice draws to a conclu&s;ion,&mdash;if the &s;tep is con&s;idered advi&s;eable, the &s;ooner we attempt to enli&s;t, the better in all probability will the work &s;ucceed.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. Fuhrer and Mr. Klein&s;mit have lately left the Briti&s;h lines, and come in to us. The account they give of them&s;elves is this, that they had been fir&s;t-lieuten|ants in the He&s;&s;ian corps, were taken pri&s;oners at Trenton, re&s;ided during their captivity at Dumfries in Virginia, were lately exchanged, and have &s;ince re&s;igned their commi&s;&s;ions; that having &s;olicited permi&s;&s;ion to come out from the enemy, and being refu&s;ed, they determined to leave them at all hazards, and have now put their de&s;ign in execution. The circum&s;tances of their captivity are known to &s;everal of|ficers in our army.</P>
<P>They are de&s;irous of entering into our &s;ervice, ob&s;erving that there are a number of German officers in the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition with them&s;elves, who will re&s;ign and join us, if they find that the&s;e meet with proper countenance. It ap|pears to me that important advantages may attend the en|couraging a di&s;po&s;ition of this nature (if it really exi&s;ts,&mdash;which is far from being impo&s;&s;ible) from the influence it will nece&s;&s;arily have upon the &s;oldiery by increa&s;ing that &s;pirit of de&s;ertion and di&s;content which already prevails among them.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s will be&s;t judge of the propriety of employing the&s;e gentlemen. I have been thinking in what manner it might be done: and the mode lea&s;t exceptionable, which at pre&s;|ent occurs to me, is to authori&s;e them to rai&s;e a corps for them&s;elves by enli&s;ting &s;uch German inhabitants, and &s;uch de&s;erters from the foreign troops, as may be willing to en|gage. The corps at fir&s;t, as it is only by way of experi|ment, need not be large, but may be afterwards increa&s;ed
<PB N="294" REF="029737_0632_0FE29CCF64936358">
as circum&s;tances &s;hall point out. This mea&s;ure, I appre|hend, cannot be attended with any material inconvenience, and may be productive of utility. If the gentlemen are employed at all, it mu&s;t be in a new corps, as they could not be introduced into any of tho&s;e already formed, with|out injuring the officers in them, and producing di&s;&s;atisfac|tion, murmurs, and re&s;ignations.</P>
<P>I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ounded them on the plan here &s;ugge&s;ted, and they &s;eem to be very &s;anguine in its &s;ucce&s;s, and anxious to undertake it. They expect &s;ome augmentation in rank; and indeed it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary, in order the more effectually to intere&s;t others to follow their example: but caution &s;hould be u&s;ed not to carry the idea too far, becau&s;e, be|&s;ides other weighty con&s;iderations, the higher the rank con|ferred on them, the more difficult it will be to provide for tho&s;e who may hereafter come to us, and who will of cour&s;e frame their expectations by compari&s;on.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you to-day by captain Riley, I received a letter from general Sullivan, a copy of which you have inclo&s;ed. From this it appears the count D'E&s;taing had not returned with his &s;quadron on the thirteenth in&s;tant: and there is rea&s;on to fear, from the violence of the weather ever &s;ince, that he has not yet got in. This accident has much deranged our views; and I &s;hall be happy if it does not totally defeat our enterpri&s;e again&s;t Rhode-I&s;land. I feel much for the count. He has been peculiarly unfortunate in the combination of &s;ev|eral untoward circum&s;tances to fru&s;trate his plans.</P>
<P>The letter addre&s;&s;ed to you accompanied mine from gen|eral Sullivan. They were both delivered at the &s;ame in|&s;tant; and through inadvertence I broke the &s;eal of yours.

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour of tran&s;mitting to Congre&s;s the inclo&s;ed memorial of colonel Rawlings, pre&s;ented in behalf of him&s;elf and the Maryland officers who were un|der his command in the year 1776. The facts which are &s;tated in it are generally true: and I cannot but feel my&s;elf exceedingly intere&s;ted in favour of the&s;e gentlemen. The conduct of this whole corps, when Fort-Wa&s;hington was attacked, is &s;o generally known and approved, that it is al|mo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to add upon the &s;ubject. However, I think it but ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve that every repre&s;entation of that day's tran&s;action gave them the highe&s;t credit. They fought with a degree of veteran bravery; and, though but a handful, they maintained their ground a con&s;iderable time, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t vigorous efforts to force them. All who were &s;pectators upon the occa&s;ion have declared this; and the enemy them&s;elves have not refu&s;ed them applau&s;e.</P>
<P>It &s;eems hard that officers of their merit &s;hould be over|looked,&mdash;and a lo&s;s to the &s;ervice that they &s;hould remain unemployed: but the con&s;equences that would attend their
<PB N="297" REF="029737_0635_0FE29D3A46971688">
incorporation with any of the corps now exi&s;ting appear too di&s;agreeable to try the experiment. Colonel Rawlings him&s;elf, from the information I have had, does not incline to give any unea&s;ine&s;s to the line of the army, and would rather make a di&s;tant part of it again&s;t the Indians, in ca&s;e he could be provided for in that way. Captain Beall, who is charged with this, will be able to inform Congre&s;s more fully than I can of the wi&s;hes of the colonel and the re&s;t of his officers; and his account may lead perhaps to &s;ome &s;uitable and practicable provi&s;ion for them. As I have ob&s;erved before, they are men who de&s;erve well of their country. I only mention the Maryland officers upon this occa&s;ion, becau&s;e that part of the corps which came from Virginia was provided for by the State in their pre&s;ent ar|rangement, as I have been credibly advi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Rawlings was never in the complete and actual command of the regiment under his direction as colonel, becau&s;e he never obtained a commi&s;&s;ion: but he became entitled to it according to the then common rule of promo|tion by the death of colonel Stephen&s;on, and the non-accept|ance of colonel Morgan who was appointed to it. Of the latter circum&s;tance, Mr. Rawlings, I am per&s;uaded, was never appri&s;ed, as it was kept a &s;ecret from an apprehen&s;ion that the enemy might claim an officer of the rank of colo|nel in exchange for Morgan who was then a pri&s;oner on parole, if his promotion came to their knowledge. Major Williams, of the Maryland part of the corps, was appointed by the State to one of her regiments now in the field, and is the only officer in his predicament I know of, that they arranged.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WOULD take the liberty to inform Congre&s;s that colonel Armand is come to camp with his corps, and has applied to me for commi&s;&s;ions for his officers. By the re&s;olution for e&s;tabli&s;hing the corps, it was to be officered out of the foreigners then commi&s;&s;ioned in our &s;ervice, who were not nor could be provided for in any of the regiments. In&s;tead of this, there are only three officers in this corps who before held any commi&s;&s;ions in our &s;ervice, viz. lieu|tenant-colonel Vrigney, and captains Mercley and Shafner. The two la&s;t were only lieutenants, and are now appointed to captaincies, contrary (it &s;eems to me) to the &s;pirit and intention of the re&s;olution.</P>
<P>As colonel Armand has departed from his in&s;tructions which mu&s;t govern me, I am not authori&s;ed to grant the commi&s;&s;ions he requires, and am therefore under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of troubling Congre&s;s with the arrangement of the corps, N^o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, as it now actually &s;tands for their con&s;idera|tion and deci&s;ion. The colonel founds his deviation from the re&s;olve upon &s;ome verbal intimation given him that the part in que&s;tion would not be in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o take the liberty to mention that general Du Portail lately delivered me a memorial, in which, among other things, he repre&s;ents that he had made an agreement with Congre&s;s at his fir&s;t appointment, that nei|ther him&s;elf nor the other gentlemen with him &s;hould ever be commanded by any of the engineers who had preceded them in our army. I could not but an&s;wer that the com|mi&s;&s;ions of officers were the only rule of precedency and command I had to judge by; and, while others held &s;u|perior appointments, I mu&s;t con&s;ider them accordingly in the cour&s;e of &s;ervice. He gave me the inclo&s;ed letter to you upon the &s;ubject, and is extremely anxious to leave the matter placed upon a certain footing; and, no doubt, it will be for the good and tranquillity of the &s;ervice that the claim be determined as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible one way or the other. At the &s;ame time I think it right to ob&s;erve, that it cannot be expected that colonel Co&s;ciu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ko, who has been a good while in this line, and conducted him&s;elf with rep|utation

and &s;atisfaction, will con&s;ent to act in a &s;ubordinate capacity to any of the French gentlemen except general Du Portail. * * *</P>
<P>Since I had the honour of writing you on the twenty-fifth in&s;tant, I have not received a &s;ingle line from general Sullivan. The only intelligence I have from the ea&s;tward is from mon&s;ieur Pontjobeau. This gentleman left Rhode-I&s;land the twenty-&s;eventh, and arrived about two hours ago in camp. From him I learn that our people were &s;till on the i&s;land;&mdash;that it was generally thought they had made effectual provi&s;ion for a retreat in ca&s;e of exigency;&mdash;that in the evening of that day he met mon&s;ieur Preville, an officer belonging to the Languedoc, at Providence, go|ing with di&s;patches to general Sullivan,&mdash;who informed him that the French fleet had got into Bo&s;ton. He further adds, that mon&s;ieur Calonne who was in company with him at Providence, and who had more conver&s;ation with mon|&s;ieur Preville than he him&s;elf had, told him that mon&s;ieur Preville &s;aid count D'E&s;taing had &s;ailed or was on the point of &s;ailing again for Rhode-I&s;land with ten &s;hips of the line and his frigates.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honoured with your favour of the twenty-eighth and that of the thirtieth ultimo, with the &s;everal inclo&s;ures to which they refer.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s may rely that I will u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible means in my power to conciliate any differences that may have ari&s;en in con&s;equence of the count D'E&s;taing's going to Bo&s;ton, and to prevent a publication of the prote&s;t upon the occa&s;ion. Several days before the receipt of the re&s;o|lution, I had written to the ea&s;tward, urging the nece&s;&s;ity of harmony, and the expediency of affording the admiral every a&s;&s;i&s;tance to refit his &s;hips. This I repeated after the re&s;olution came to hand; and I have al&s;o taken op|portunity to reque&s;t all the general officers here to place the matter in the mo&s;t favourable point of view whenever they hear it mentioned.</P>
<P>The five hundred guineas, which Congre&s;s were plea&s;ed to order, came &s;afe to hand, and &s;hall be appropriated to the purpo&s;es they intended, and as the exigency of the &s;er|vice may require. For want of &s;upplies of this &s;ort, we have been very deficient in intelligence in many important and intere&s;ting points. In &s;ome ca&s;es, no con&s;ideration in paper money has been found &s;ufficient to effect even an engagement to procure it: and, where it has been other|wi&s;e, the terms of &s;ervice, on account of the depreciation, have been high, if not exorbitant.</P>
<P>The de&s;igns of the enemy, as to their future movements, remain yet entirely [<HI>in the dark:</HI>] but the expectation of their leaving the continent is daily decrea&s;ing. The hur|ricane &s;ea&s;on &s;eems oppo&s;ed to their going to the We&s;t-Indies; and the pa&s;&s;age to Europe in a little time will become more and more dangerous. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is another circum&s;tance, of &s;ome weight, if true, to induce a belief that they mean to &s;tay. It appears by the papers that part of the regiments lately rai&s;ed in Britain are order|ed to Halifax. If the troops here were intended to be recalled, it would &s;eem that &s;ome of them would be &s;ent to reinforce that garri&s;on &s;ooner than troops from England or Scotland; and hence I think it may be pre&s;umed that another campaign will take place in America, e&s;pecially if

admini&s;tration are di&s;appointed in their expectations from the commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Where the theatre of war may be, mu&s;t be a matter of conjecture. But, as it is an acknowledged fact that an army acting in the ea&s;tern States mu&s;t derive flour for its &s;upport from tho&s;e more we&s;tern, I &s;ubmit to Congre&s;s the expediency, and, in my opinion, the nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;tabli&s;h|ing, without lo&s;s of time, magazines of this article at con|venient places (removed from the Sound) in Connecticut and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. I am the more induced to wi&s;h an early con&s;ideration of this point, as, by a &s;udden move of the army (&s;hould events make it nece&s;&s;ary) the departments of commi&s;&s;ary and quarter-ma&s;ter would be greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed. Nor would &s;uch magazines, I &s;hould imagine, be at|tended with any con&s;iderable lo&s;s, though the army &s;hould not operate in that quarter, as the flour would an&s;wer oc|ca&s;ionally for our &s;hipping, and the &s;urplus might in all probability be otherwi&s;e readily di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P>I take the liberty of tran&s;mitting to Congre&s;s a memorial I received from the reverend Mr. Tetard. From the cer|tificates annexed to it, he appears to be a man of great mer|it: and, from every account, he has &s;uffered in the ex|treme in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t. His attachment, &s;ervices, and misfortunes, &s;eem to give him a claim to a generous notice: but, according to the new e&s;tabli&s;hment of the army, it is not in my power to make any provi&s;ion for him. I therefore recommend his ca&s;e to the attention and con|&s;ideration of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Six o'clock, P. M.</HI> I this minute received a letter from general Sullivan, of which the inclo&s;ure, N^o 2, is a copy. I &s;hall be exceedingly happy if a perfect reconciliation has taken place between him and the count and all the officers. His letter will &s;hew &s;ome of the rea&s;ons that led to the prote&s;t, and that it was the hope of our officers that it would have operated as a ju&s;tification to the admir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, to return again&s;t the &s;entiments of his council, e&s;pecially as it coincided (as it is &s;aid) with his own inclination.

not expre&s;&s;ed in the re&s;olution of that date that any other bounty is to be given to the men who engage for three years or during the war, than twenty dollars, I &s;hall take it for granted they are to receive the u&s;ual allowances of clothing and land. There are &s;everal continental troops who&s;e time of &s;ervice will expire at the end of the fall or during the winter.

<P>From the exorbitant &s;tate, town, and &s;ub&s;titute boun|ties, I am very doubtful whether twenty dollars will be found &s;ufficient to engage &s;o great a proportion either of the draughts or continentals, as was at fir&s;t apprehended. Our failure in the enterpri&s;e again&s;t Rhode-I&s;land will have its weight; and every day, from the approach of the fall and winter, will add new difficulties.

This can remain a &s;ecret, and will not be carried into execution but in ca&s;e of evident nece&s;&s;ity. I feel very much intere&s;ted upon the occa&s;ion, and have &s;ubmitted this mode, that there may not be the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible delay in attempting to engage the men under a &s;econd expedient if the fir&s;t &s;hould not &s;ucceed.

<P>I HAD the plea&s;ure to hear this morning, by a let|ter from general Sullivan, of the thirty-fir&s;t ultimo, that he had effected a retreat to the main, the preceding night, without any lo&s;s either of men or &s;tores. As he has writ|ten to Congre&s;s fully upon the &s;ubject, and I feel their anxiety to hear it, I &s;hall not detain major Morris longer than to ob&s;erve that I think the retreat a mo&s;t fortunate, lucky, and well-timed event.</P>
<P>Major Morris informs me he has heard that lord Howe was off Bo&s;ton with his fleet: and it appears by a New-York paper of the &s;econd, that rear-admiral Parker arrived at Sandy-Hook on this day week with &s;ix &s;hips of the line, of &s;eventy-four guns each,&mdash;which is corroborated by other accounts. I tran&s;mitted the intelligence to his ex|cellency count D'E&s;taing ye&s;terday and the day before, as it acquired more and more the appearance of certainty,&mdash;as I have regularly done every occurrence intere&s;ting to his fleet and our operations.</P>

<P>I TAKE the liberty of laying before Congre&s;s the inclo&s;ed copies of a paragraph and &s;chedule contained in a letter from general Heath, which I lately received. The&s;e will appri&s;e Congre&s;s, if they are not already informed, of the &s;upplies of provi&s;ion and wood wanted by the count D'E&s;taing, and will naturally lead to a con&s;ideration of the ways and means to be pur&s;ued for furni&s;hing them as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Since I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you on the fourth and fifth in&s;tant, I have obtained a return of the blankets which are now deficient.

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour of returning to Congre&s;s the report of their committee on the &s;ubject of an in&s;pec|tor&s;hip (tran&s;mitted in your letter of the twentieth ultimo, which was not received till the thirty-fir&s;t) with &s;uch ob|&s;ervations as have occurred to me in con&s;idering the mat|ter, and which I have made with a freedom that I tru&s;t will be agreeable to Congre&s;s. I wi&s;h it had been in my power to have returned it before: but the intervention of a variety of other important bu&s;ine&s;s from time to time obliged me to po&s;tpone a conclu&s;ion upon the points till ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>I have already, in a letter of the twenty-&s;ixth of July, delivered my &s;entiments upon the con&s;equences that would attend the baron Steuben's being appointed to an actual and permanent command in the line; and therefore I will not trouble Congre&s;s with a repetition of them. How|ever, I will take the liberty to add that I am more and more convinced that what I then &s;aid upon the occa&s;ion was well founded; and that I am certain &s;uch a mea&s;ure will produce at lea&s;t infinite di&s;contents and di&s;quietudes among the general officers.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o had the honour to receive your favour of the fifth in&s;tant, with the &s;everal papers to which it refers. The&s;e &s;hall have my attention as far as practicable. I hope all the confederate troops are on the march from Phila|delphia, and, if they are not, that immediate orders will be given for their joining the army.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from general Sullivan, of the tenth in&s;tant, will inform Congre&s;s that the enemy have not relinqui&s;hed their burning plans, and that in this way they have de&s;troyed &s;everal hou&s;es, &s;tores, and ve&s;&s;els, at and near Bedford.</P>
<P>I was advi&s;ed on Wedne&s;day night that a body of them, con&s;i&s;ting of four or five thou&s;and, under general Grey, had made a landing in that quarter, and were intrenching. In con&s;equence of this, and from an apprehen&s;ion that general Clinton might po&s;&s;ibly mean to operate to the ea&s;tward and form &s;ome project in concert with lord Howe again&s;t the count D'E&s;taing's &s;quadron, I determined to move the

troops from this ground to a rear po&s;ition, better calculated to afford &s;upport to the works on the North-river in ca&s;e an attempt &s;hould be made again&s;t them, and at the &s;ame time more convenient for forwarding detachments to the ea&s;tward, if the enemy point their operations that way.</P>
<P>I was the more induced to come to this determination as mo&s;t of the accounts from New-York &s;eemed to lead to a belief, as they &s;till do, that a con&s;iderable movement was and is in contemplation, if not an entire evacuation of the city, and this by water. Be&s;ides the&s;e rea&s;ons, the princi|pal objects for taking po&s;t here do not now exi&s;t. One was to create every po&s;&s;ible jealou&s;y in favour of the expe|dition again&s;t Rhode-I&s;land; another, the con&s;uming the forage within its vicinity and towards King&s;bridge. The former is now over, and the latter in a great degree ac|compli&s;hed.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing you on the twelfth in&s;tant, I have received your &s;everal favours of the tenth, twelfth and &s;ixteenth, with the re&s;olutions to which they allude. I tran&s;mitted the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners the re&s;olve of the fourth in&s;tant re&s;pecting the convention troops the morning after it came to hand, and al&s;o wrote to Sir Henry Clinton upon the &s;ubject of pa&s;&s;ports. I have not received his an&s;wer.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the magazines, I have directed the com|mi&s;&s;ary to form them on the inland communication from hence to Bo&s;ton, at proper intervals. The twenty thou|&s;and barrels of flour that Congre&s;s have ordered to be pur|cha&s;ed will be a valuable addition, if they can be tran&s;port|ed by water: but it &s;eems to me there will be great ri&s;k of its being lo&s;t, if it is &s;ent by &s;ea while the enemy have a &s;u|perior fleet on our coa&s;t.</P>
<P>As the campaign is not clo&s;ed yet, all our cavalry are of u&s;e. They lie in the neighbourhood of the enemy's po&s;ts, for the purpo&s;e of re&s;training their parties, and for obtain|ing and giving intelligence of their movements; and they
<PB N="307" REF="029737_0645_0FE29DAAB70FBBD0">
are &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon the forage which would otherwi&s;e be ex|po&s;ed to them. I am &s;en&s;ible that the&s;e corps are attended with great expen&s;e; and the moment I think the &s;ervice will admit of it, they or a part of them &s;hall be quartered in different places di&s;tant from the army, where they may be provided for on better terms. The price of forage, and the difficulty of getting it, are really objects of great magnitude, and &s;uch as &s;hould undergo &s;ome regulation, if there is any that can be adopted. I received letters a few days ago from the commi&s;&s;ary and quarter-ma&s;ter upon this &s;ubject, copies of which, and of my letter in con&s;equence to the &s;everal States from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay to Penn&s;ylva|nia inclu&s;ive, I take the liberty to inclo&s;e.</P>
<P>The re&s;olution prohibiting officers, except &s;uch as are &s;pecially authori&s;ed, to keep hor&s;es in the army or within forty miles of it, has been publi&s;hed in orders, and I will take every &s;tep in my power to give it effect.</P>
<P>I have con&s;idered the practicability of reducing the teams employed in the army, and find, however de&s;irable the object may be, that it cannot be done. We have not at this time more than are ab&s;olutely and indi&s;pen&s;ably nec|e&s;&s;ary, nor &s;o many as would be nece&s;&s;ary in ca&s;e of a rap|id movement: neither does it appear to me that there can be a &s;ub&s;titution of ox for hor&s;e teams, at lea&s;t to any great extent; nor that any material advantages would ari&s;e from &s;uch a mea&s;ure. There might perhaps be a &s;mall &s;aving in the article of provender: but this, I fear, would be greatly over-balanced in the lo&s;s of cattle that would be appropri|ated to the u&s;e of the commi&s;&s;ary's department. After a full inve&s;tigation of the &s;ubject, I believe we &s;hall be obliged to adhere to the kind of teams we now employ, and that the only relief we &s;hall have in point of expen&s;e will ari&s;e from &s;ending a part of the hor&s;es to places where they may be more ea&s;ily foraged, when we have fixed our camp and quarters for the winter.</P>
<P>I beg leave to mention to Congre&s;s that there is a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of &s;ome mode's being e&s;tabli&s;hed, by which claims on the old quarter-ma&s;ter&s;hip, that remain un&s;atisfied, may be di&s;charged. There are many of this nature; and the&s;e, however well authenticated they may be, the gentlemen now in office do not conceive them&s;elves at liberty to ad|ju&s;t,
<PB N="308" REF="029737_0646_0FE29D4CCCAAB0E8">
without obtaining &s;ome &s;pecial direction for the purpo&s;e. I am every day applied to for payment of &s;uch accounts, and, in many in&s;tances, have been obliged, as well for the &s;ake of ju&s;tice to individuals as for the public good, to or|der them to be taken up. It appears to me that Congre&s;s cannot be too early in their re&s;olution upon this occa&s;ion, and that either the pre&s;ent department &s;hould be authori&s;ed to &s;ettle and pay &s;uch claims, or that &s;ome per&s;ons &s;hould be appointed and &s;upplied with money for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The army marched from White-Plains on the &s;ixteenth in&s;tant, and is now encamped in different places. Three brigades, compo&s;ing the Virginia troops, part of the right wing, under the command of general Putnam, are at Rob|in&s;on's near We&s;t-Point: and two brigades more, com|po&s;ing the remainder, are with baron De Kalb at Fi&s;hkill plains, about ten miles from the town, on the road leading to Sharon. The &s;econd line, with lord Stirling, is in the vicinity of Frederic&s;burg; and the whole of the left wing at Danbury under the command of general Gates. The&s;e &s;everal po&s;ts appear to be the be&s;t we can occupy in the pre&s;|ent doubtful &s;tate of things, as they have relation to the &s;upport of We&s;t-Point in ca&s;e of an attack in that quarter, and are al&s;o on the communication to the ea&s;tward, if the enemy point their operations that way. Be&s;ides the&s;e di&s;|po&s;itions, general Scott with a light corps remains below in the country about King's-Street.</P>
<P>The letter from Sir Henry Clinton which I have the honour of tran&s;mitting was &s;ent to me to-day by colonel Baylor who is po&s;ted at Hackin&s;ac. He &s;ays he received one for me by the &s;ame flag; and, from his note, he &s;up|po&s;ed he had charged the hor&s;eman with it who ju&s;t arriv|ed at Head-Quarters. Through accident he forwarded yours to me; and I think it probable that you will be troubled with mine. If this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, you will be &s;o obliging as to return it to me by the fir&s;t conveyance. I was al&s;o informed by colonel Baylor, that a con&s;iderable body of the enemy landed at Paulus' Hook in the evening of the twenty-&s;econd, and were encamped that night in the woods between four and five miles from the town of Ber|gen. He had not learned their object: but it is likely they are after forage.</P>

<P>THE following is an extract of a letter of the &s;ev|enteenth in&s;tant, which I had the honour to receive from the count D'E&s;taing.</P>
<P>"I entreat you to promote the exchange of pri&s;oners already planned by mon&s;ieur Girard. The unhappy per|&s;ons taken before the commencement of ho&s;tilities cannot be fully regarded as pri&s;oners: their lot is dreadful. The mode adopted for exchanging them by means of your com|mi&s;&s;ary, without introducing the king's name or mine into the tran&s;action, removes a great part of the political diffi|culties which before &s;ub&s;i&s;ted."</P>
<P>I am an entire &s;tranger to the plan above referred to, or to the mode that has been adopted for exchanging by means of our commi&s;&s;ary. He is ab&s;ent from the army: and I mu&s;t therefore beg the favour of you to obtain from mon&s;ieur Girard &s;uch information as will enable me to give directions for carrying the count's de&s;ires into execution, if practicable.</P>
<P>The marquis De Vienne, at pre&s;ent at Bo&s;ton, has re|que&s;ted a furlough of eighteen months to enable him to return to France, whither he is called by &s;ome dome&s;tic concerns. I do not conceive my&s;elf at liberty to grant his reque&s;t without the permi&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s, to whom I would beg leave to ob&s;erve, that, if agreeable to them, he may be indulged without prejudice to the &s;ervice, as he is not attached to any particular command.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t received an account from Jer&s;ey, which I fear is too true, that colonel Baylor's regiment of dragoons were &s;urpri&s;ed in their quarters the night before la&s;t, and mo&s;t of them killed or taken. A few of the &s;tragglers have come in, who can give but a very imperfect account of the matter. They think the colonel and mo&s;t of the officers were made pri&s;oners, and that the privates were put to the &s;word. There were, I imagine, about one hundred men of the regiment together when this unlucky accident happened.</P>
<P>The &s;tay of the enemy in Jer&s;ey being longer than I apprehended, and not knowing what their real intentions
<PB N="310" REF="029737_0648_0FE29D4E5154A158">
may be, I have ordered general Maxwell to advance from Elizabethtown to the neighbourhood of Acquakenunk bridge, and have &s;ent over general Woodford's brigade from this &s;ide of the river. I have al&s;o ordered general Pula&s;ki to advance with as much expedition as po&s;&s;ible, and join the brigades. Lord Stirling has this day gone over to take the command of the continental forces and militia who are a&s;&s;embling in con&s;iderable numbers. If the enemy mean only to forage, they will be kept from ex|tending them&s;elves by the&s;e troops: and if they have any de&s;igns upon the po&s;ts in the Highlands, they will be pre|vented from &s;eizing the pa&s;&s;es leading to the forts, by lord Stirling, who will be between them and the enemy, and always ready to po&s;&s;es them.</P>
<P>I have made proper di&s;po&s;itions on this &s;ide the river for the &s;ecurity of the Highlands, in ca&s;e that body of the enemy, who are on this &s;ide King&s;bridge employed in col|lecting forage, &s;hould advance.</P>
<P>The &s;ketch of Rhode-I&s;land, forwarded by this expre&s;s, was received from general Sullivan, and left behind by accident when the la&s;t di&s;patches were &s;ent off.</P>
<P>I have had the honour of receiving yours of the twen|tieth, inclo&s;ing an order for count Pula&s;ki's legion to ad|vance to Trenton.</P>

Putnam acro&s;s the river for the immediate &s;ecurity of We&s;t-Point, and moved a divi&s;ion of troops to this place, to be nearer that po&s;t. I have &s;ince come here my&s;elf, and propo&s;e to remain till the views of the enemy on the Jer&s;eys are decided: though I have had no rea&s;on to al|ter my opinion that nothing more than a forage is intend|ed.

<P>That part of Baylor's regiment which e&s;caped came off in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and were afterwards brought off in &s;o di&s;per&s;ed a manner that the number has not been a&s;cer|tained: but, from what I have learned, I &s;hould e&s;timate the lo&s;s at about fifty men and &s;eventy hor&s;es. Major Clough is dead of his wounds. This affair &s;eems to have been attended with every circum&s;tance of cruelty.</P>
<P>It is a &s;mall compen&s;ation for this accident, that colonel Butler three or four days ago, with a party of infantry and hor&s;e comprehending major Lee's corps, &s;urpri&s;ed about a hundred Yagers below Tarrytown, killed ten on the &s;pot, and took a lieutenant and eighteen men pri&s;oners.

<P>THE ince&s;&s;ant and pre&s;&s;ing applications of the offi|cers, and their real di&s;tre&s;s for clothing, oblige me to re|peat my wi&s;hes to the board, to obtain the earlie&s;t direction of Congre&s;s for relieving their wants. They are in a very di&s;agreeable &s;ituation in this re&s;pect; and, unle&s;s &s;ome mode can be adopted for &s;peedily &s;upplying them, many will be obliged involuntarily to quit the &s;ervice; or, if this &s;hould not be the ca&s;e, we &s;hall be involved in perpetual complaints, and the mo&s;t painful applications.</P>
<P>I do not recollect, when the army was fir&s;t appointed, that there was any engagement on the part of the public that the officers &s;hould be provided with clothing through their means; nor has there been any explicit declaration
<PB N="313" REF="029737_0651_0FE29DB95269F958">
&s;ince, that I remember, for the purpo&s;e: but the mea&s;ure has become indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary; and, without the in|tervention of public aid, they never can be &s;upplied: for their pay, if the articles proper could be found in a private way, (from the enormous and exorbitant prices now ex|acted for every thing) would prove wholly incompetent to the end.</P>
<P>There is however a re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, of the twen|ty-&s;econd of November la&s;t, which points to a provi&s;ion through the public means and tho&s;e of the States individ|ually taken. This has encouraged the officers to look for &s;upplies in the manner there profe&s;&s;ed; and their not being able to obtain them makes them more unea&s;y perhaps than if the re&s;olution had never pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I have written to me&s;&s;ieurs Otis and Andrews to make a return of the cloth, &amp;c. in their hands, proper for offi|cers, and al&s;o to advi&s;e me what quantities might be pro|cured in ca&s;e the board &s;hould direct a purcha&s;e. This appears to be the only practicable expedient at this time, from which relief can be drawn: and, if it is to be adopt|ed, the agents cannot be too &s;oon ordered to carry it into execution. I really wi&s;h to be informed by the board by the fir&s;t opportunity whether the officers may expect &s;up|plies through the public &s;tores, that I may be able to an|&s;wer them deci&s;ively upon the point when they apply. As matters now &s;tand, I am in a very awkward and irk&s;ome &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Since it is evident that the officers cannot provide them|&s;elves with clothing, and that there is a nece&s;&s;ity for the intervention of the public aid, I would &s;ubmit it to the board whether it may not be proper for them to form an e&s;timate of clothing, proportioned to the number of officers in the army, for the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, and to ob|tain their &s;anction for importing the &s;ame, if they approve the plan. This mea&s;ure, it &s;eems to me, is the only one that can in&s;ure relief in future; and it appears the more eligible as the lo&s;s to the public will be infinitely le&s;s than if they procure the articles in the country, &s;uppo&s;ing that it could be done. Be&s;ides this con&s;ideration, the officers then might be properly uniformed and all placed on a ju&s;t and equal footing.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="029737_0652_0FE29D5AF69AE990">
If the board &s;hould be authori&s;ed to direct an immedi|ate purcha&s;e of clothing for the officers, I will take the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">erty to &s;ugge&s;t that it may not be improper for them to enjoin on the part of the clothier a &s;trict compliance with the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s which I have mentioned, in the &s;ale. The officers &s;ay that hitherto it has not had the nece&s;&s;ary and generous operation intended by Congre&s;s; but, on the contrary, in the few in&s;tances in which they have been able to furni&s;h them&s;elves with articles from the public &s;tores, that they have done it at the current exorbi|tant prices. Indeed, there are many matters in the de|partment which require a more perfect and explicit arrange|ment than has ever been made: and at pre&s;ent there is &s;uch a cla&s;hing of offices and officers that it is difficult to determine how or with whom bu&s;ine&s;s is to be tran&s;acted.</P>

<P>I do my&s;elf the honour of tran&s;mitting you an account of the engagement between the French and Briti&s;h fleets on the twenty-&s;eventh of July, as publi&s;hed by the Briti&s;h admiralty-board. I received a printed copy of it la&s;t night from New-York, which I have forwarded to his excellen|cy count D'E&s;taing. It is evident from admiral Keppel's own relation of the affair, that he was pretty &s;everely han|dled, notwithanding he affects in the conclu&s;ion to mention that he wi&s;hed extremely for an opportunity to renew the combat the next day.</P>
<P>We are &s;till in great &s;u&s;pen&s;e as to the operations and de&s;igns of the enemy, though every practicable mea&s;ure has been u&s;ed and is pur&s;uing, to come at them.

<P>I AM honoured with yours of the ninth, inclo&s;ing the re&s;olves to extend the embargo, and to prevent fore|&s;talling provi&s;ions. I hope the latter will have the de&s;ired effect: for, unle&s;s that mo&s;t infamous practice of rai&s;ing the prices of the nece&s;&s;aries of life can be &s;topped, it will be impo&s;&s;ible for any funds to &s;ub&s;i&s;t the army.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed you have the copy of a petition from the ref|ugees in New-York to the commi&s;&s;ioners. You may depend upon the authenticity of it, as it is taken from a New-York paper. It &s;hould &s;eem by this that they are extremely &s;o|licitous and anxious to know whether New-York is to be garri&s;oned, which implies a &s;u&s;picion on their part that it is to be evacuated. All accounts, &s;ince mine of the four|teenth, confirm the report of a very con&s;iderable embarka|tion. It is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of ten Briti&s;h regiments com|pleted to their full e&s;tabli&s;hment, and their grenadier and light companies added to them. This will make them amount to upwards of five thou&s;and men. They have not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ailed.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay that I am &s;atisfied that a total evacuation of the city is intended this winter, although many inhabit|ants near the lines, and &s;everal out of the city, are of that opinion. I have &s;et every engine at work to procure full intelligence of their de&s;igns; and I hope to &s;ucceed.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE letter which I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing to you the day before ye&s;terday would inform Congre&s;s of the embarkation and &s;ailing of a con&s;iderable detachment of the enemy from New-York, and of the mea&s;ures I had taken in expectation of and upon the happening of the event. Whether this will be &s;ucceeded by a further em|barkation, or by a total evacuation of the po&s;ts which they hold within the States, in the cour&s;e of this year or the en&s;uing one, I cannot pretend to determine. But, as it will be right and prudent in us to provide for every con|tingency, I would with the greate&s;t deference &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s whether it may not be proper for them to call upon the States to provide men in time for filling their re&s;pective battalions, before or at any rate again&s;t the open|ing of the &s;pring, and in the &s;ame manner as if there was a moral certainty that the war would be pro&s;ecuted with all po&s;&s;ible vigour on the part of Britain. Should this not be the ca&s;e, or &s;hould any events ca&s;t up in the mean time to render troops unnece&s;&s;ary, it will be ea&s;y to di&s;band the levies and to keep them from the field,&mdash;while, on the other hand, our relaxation in not providing them may &s;ub|ject us at lea&s;t to many di&s;agreeable con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The general return of the infantry in the month of Sep|tember, tran&s;mitted to the board of war by the adjutant-general, and to which I beg leave to refer, will &s;hew Congre&s;s the whole amount of our reputed force at that time. But I am to ob&s;erve, that large, very large deduc|tions are to be made from it on account of the columns of &s;ick, and the men &s;aid to be on command. Many under the former de&s;cription, particularly that of &s;ick ab&s;ent, are actually dead; others, unfit for &s;ervice; and &s;everal, who have recovered, have de&s;erted: nor will the latter afford more than one half of its number in time of action, as various duties, &s;uch as waggoning, di&s;tant guards, e&s;corts, &amp;c. em|ploy a great proportion of tho&s;e under this denomination.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the above deductions, Congre&s;s will perceive from the returns which I now take the liberty of tran&s;mit|ting, that there are four thou&s;and three hundred and eighty draughts and others, who&s;e terms of &s;ervice will expire
<PB N="317" REF="029737_0655_0FE29DBC589C1838">
during and by the clo&s;e of winter: for I am &s;orry to add that our exertions to re-engage the draughts and old &s;old|iers in this predicament, for the u&s;ual bounty, have proved &s;o far ineffectual and without &s;ucce&s;s. I have not tried what effect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> additional grant of ten dollars might have: but I fear, and it &s;eems to be the opinion of all I have con|&s;ulted upon the occa&s;ion, that it would have but little if any influence. I know, in the ca&s;e of the draughts and troops of one State, that the offer of twenty dollars on the part of the continent, with a like allowance and an actual depo&s;it of it by the State, has been no temptation.</P>
<P>This general reluctance and refu&s;al is founded in the unhappy depreciated light in which the &s;oldiery view the money, and their expectation of receiving immen&s;e State, di&s;trict, and &s;ub&s;titute bounties. Whether grants or boun|ties by Congre&s;s, bearing &s;ome proportion to the&s;e, to &s;uch as &s;hould enli&s;t for the war, would be attended with better &s;ucce&s;s, I cannot undertake to decide. The experiment may be made if they judge it proper: and if it proves an inducement of any extent, it will be an infinite &s;aving in the end. I believe however our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ure&s;t and only certain aids will be derived from draughting, which I tru&s;t may and will be done by the States on the recommendation of Congre&s;s, agreeable to the mode mentioned in my letter to their committee when they fir&s;t honoured me with a vi&s;it at Valley-Forge. The exertions to recruit by voluntary enli&s;tments may &s;till go on, as both modes in all probabil|ity will not produce near as many men as may be found nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of the Carolina troops who&s;e &s;ervice is end|ing every day, the officers &s;ay that nothing will induce them to enli&s;t, unle&s;s they can be permitted to go home on furlough till the &s;pring. On this indulgence they &s;eem to think &s;everal might be engaged. The di&s;tance is great, and there will be &s;ome uncertainty as to their returning: be&s;ides, it will be fixing a precedent for others. If Con|gre&s;s approve the plan, they will be plea&s;ed to inform me by the earlie&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>I am under &s;ome difficulty about clothing the draughts, and the old &s;oldiers who&s;e &s;ervice is expiring and will de|termine every day. As Congre&s;s have never expre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="318" REF="029737_0656_0FE29D5E080A70F0">
their &s;en&s;e upon the &s;ubject, and this is increa&s;ed by a let|ter which I received &s;ome time ago from the board of war, which re&s;pects particularly the draughts, I mu&s;t earne&s;tly reque&s;t that Congre&s;s will favour me with the &s;peedie&s;t direction in the ca&s;e, whether they are to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> furni&s;hed out of the &s;upplies coming on, equally with the other troops. At the &s;ame time I will take the liberty to offer it as my opinion, that, however inconvenient or expen&s;ive it may appear at the fir&s;t view to clothe them, the mea&s;ure will be nece&s;&s;ary, and founded not only in humanity but &s;ound policy. We have no pro&s;pect now of levying men in any other way: and if they are not clothed, they will be ex|hau&s;ted by &s;ickne&s;s and by death; and not doing it may prove an in&s;urmountable bar or at lea&s;t a great ob&s;tacle to our obtaining future aids, though the exigencies of our af|fairs &s;hould be never &s;o pre&s;&s;ing. Yet the clothes may be withheld as long as circum&s;tances will permit, as an in|ducement for them to enli&s;t. In the in&s;tance of the old &s;oldiers who have not received the annual allowance of Congre&s;s, the point &s;eems clearly in their favour. The board &s;ugge&s;ted that the draughts might be &s;upplied out of the be&s;t of the old clothes which might be given in by the troops on receiving new ones: but unfortunately there will be few of any worth.</P>

I have complied with the intention of the third, and tran&s;mitted the act to Sir Henry Clinton, which re|lates to Mr. Franks.</P>
<P>The certain intelligence of a large number of troops having embarked at New-York,&mdash;the &s;ailing of a con&s;ider|able fleet concurring at the moment their departure was
<PB N="319" REF="029737_0657_0FE29DC8AAE118B8">

In the per&s;ua&s;ion of this, my letter of the twenty-&s;econd to your excellency was written: but, from more recent advices, and through various channels, bearing every mark of authenticity, I am to conclude the &s;uppo&s;ition has been ill founded. The above-mentioned fleet appears to have carried away no other troops than in|valids, the officers of the corps lately reduced, with &s;ome refugees. The twenty-third in&s;tant the troops which had embarked &s;till remained in the harbour. They are fixed at ten or twelve Briti&s;h regiments, and &s;ix of the new levies. This fleet was probably compo&s;ed of homeward-bound victuallers, with &s;ome merchantmen and other ve&s;|&s;els, which cho&s;e to take the protection of a convoy.

<P>I HAVE been honoured with yours of the nineteenth, twenty-&s;eventh, twenty-eighth, and twenty-ninth ultimo.</P>
<P>A tolerable &s;upply of &s;hoes has lately arrived to the i&s;&s;u|ing clothier's &s;tore from the ea&s;tward, Penn&s;ylvania, and Jer&s;ey: and, if the different per&s;ons employed in procuring that article will exert them&s;elves to keep up the &s;upply, I hope we &s;hall not be much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed during the winter, provided we remain quietly in quarters.</P>
<P>It is much to be wi&s;hed that Congre&s;s would come to a &s;peedy re&s;olution concerning the procuring clothing for the officers at a price in proportion to their pay, more e&s;pecial|ly as they were led to expect this from a re&s;olve which pa&s;&s;ed in November, 1777. If the clothing it&s;elf cannot be conveniently procured, I imagine the alternative of al|lowing an adequate &s;um of money in lieu thereof would be the next be&s;t expedient.</P>
<P>As the board mu&s;t undoubtedly have experienced the many difficulties ari&s;ing from the want of a proper arrange|ment of the clothier's department, I hope they will pre&s;s the committee who have that bu&s;ine&s;s in charge, to bring in their report, that the new &s;y&s;tem may be carried into execution without lo&s;s of time. Whether it has been ow|ing to want of conduct in the late officer, or his want of proper powers and directions, I will not undertake to de|termine: but the irregularity in that department has been
<PB N="322" REF="029737_0660_0FE29D6A53E17A40">
an endle&s;s &s;ource of trouble to me, and a great cau&s;e of di&s;|content in the army.</P>
<P>I have given the i&s;&s;uing clothier directions to keep an ac|count of the marks and numbers of the bales of blankets, and of the quality of their contents, from whence you will be able to trace from whom tho&s;e &s;mall ones were purcha&s;ed. When the i&s;&s;ues are completed, you &s;hall have the account. The directions to Mr. Mea&s;e were very proper. If any corps want completing in any particular article which is not to be procured here, I will &s;ign the order my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent &s;carcity of hats, the caps of which you have forwarded a pattern mu&s;t be u&s;ed by way of &s;ub&s;titute. But an officer very attentive to the health of his men in|forms me that he found an inconvenience from the u&s;e of woollen caps la&s;t winter in&s;tead of hats: when the men put them off in the &s;pring, they many of them took violent colds from the &s;udden tran&s;ition. They al&s;o contribute to keep the head dirty, than which nothing is more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">healthy.</P>
<P>I find it impracticable to carry the recommendation of the board, re&s;pecting calling in the old clothes upon deliv|ery of the new, into execution. The &s;oldiers were not to be convinced of the good policy and economy intended by the application of the old clothes to ho&s;pitals and the fol|lowers of the army, but looked upon it as an unju&s;tifiable attempt to deprive them of what they had earned by their year's &s;ervice, and what (con&s;idering the &s;canty &s;upply of &s;ome kinds of covering, blankets in particular) would help to make them more comfortable during the winter. The&s;e di&s;contents were communicated to me, the moment they aro&s;e, by &s;ome of the be&s;t officers in the line: which de|termined me to let the matter drop, more e&s;pecially as another argument was made u&s;e of, which was unan&s;wera|ble: this was, that, upon a fair &s;ettlement, there would be found a con&s;iderable deficiency of the bounty-clothing for a year or two pa&s;t, and that therefore it would be more equitable to make up the deficiency than to draw in the remains.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON Wedne&s;day afternoon I received a letter from the honourable Mr. Lee and Mr. Lovell of the committee for foreign affairs, inclo&s;ing a plan and &s;undry re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s for attacking Canada the next campaign in conjunction with the forces of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty, and reque&s;ting my ob&s;ervations upon the &s;ame to be tran&s;|mitted to Congre&s;s, and a copy to be delivered to the mar|quis De la Fayette. The&s;e di&s;patches, through the indi&s;|po&s;ition of the marquis (who unfortunately was &s;eized with a fever in his journey from Philadelphia, which &s;till de|tains him at Fi&s;hkill) were prevented coming to hand till that time: and the great importance and extent of the &s;ubject they comprehend would not permit me the honour of an earlier communication of my &s;entiments. I hope Con|gre&s;s will excu&s;e my not complying with that part of the re&s;olution which requires me to deliver a copy of my ob|&s;ervations to the marquis, as the manner in which I am obliged to treat the &s;ubject opens &s;uch a pro&s;pect of our wants and our weakne&s;&s;es, as, in point of policy, ought on|ly to be known to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>I am always happy to concur in &s;entiment with Congre&s;s; and I view the emancipation of Canada as an object very intere&s;ting to the future pro&s;perity and tranquillity of the&s;e States: but I am &s;orry to &s;ay the plan propo&s;ed for the purpo&s;e does not appear to me to be eligible under our pre&s;|ent circum&s;tances. I con&s;ider it as my duty, and what Congre&s;s expects from me, to give my rea&s;ons for this opin|ion with that frankne&s;s and candour which the importance of the &s;ubject demands; and, in doing this, I am per&s;uaded I &s;hall nor fail to meet with their approbation.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me impolitic to enter into engagements with the court of France for carrying on a combined operation of any kind without a moral certainty of being able to ful|fil our parts, particularly if the fir&s;t propo&s;al came from us. If we &s;hould not be able to perform them, it would argue either a want of con&s;ideration, a defective knowledge of our re&s;ources, or &s;omething wor&s;e than either, which could not fail to produce a degree of di&s;tru&s;t and di&s;content that might be very injurious to the Union. In the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance,
<PB N="324" REF="029737_0662_0FE29D6BD79A6B60">
&s;hould the &s;cheme propo&s;ed be adopted, a failure on our part would certainly occa&s;ion in them a mi&s;application of a con&s;iderable land and naval force which might be u&s;e|fully employed el&s;ewhere, and probably their total lo&s;s. It is true, if we were at this time to enter into the engagement, we &s;hould be every day better able to judge whether it will be in our power to accompli&s;h what may be expected from us: and, if we &s;hould find hereafter that our re&s;ources will be unequal to the undertaking, we may give notice to the court of France in &s;ea&s;on to prevent the &s;ailing of the troops and the ill effects which might attend it. But be&s;ides that a project of this kind could not be embraced by France without its having an influence on the whole &s;y&s;tem of oper|ations for the next campaign, which of cour&s;e would re|ceive &s;ome derangement from its being abandoned, a re|nunciation of this could not fail to give a very unfavoura|ble impre&s;&s;ion of our fore&s;ight and providence, and would &s;erve to weaken the confidence of that court in our public councils.</P>
<P>So far from there being a moral certainty of our com|plying with our engagements, it may in my opinion be very &s;afely pronounced, that, if the enemy keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their pre&s;ent po&s;ts at New-York and Rhode-I&s;land, it will be impracticable either to furni&s;h the men or the other nece&s;|&s;ary &s;upplies for pro&s;ecuting the plan. They will not at|tempt to keep tho&s;e po&s;ts with le&s;s than ten thou&s;and men and a con&s;iderable navy. If it &s;hould be thought be&s;t for the advantage of carrying on the expeditions intended, to forego any offen&s;ive operations again&s;t the&s;e garri&s;ons, and to leave them in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch important places, we &s;hall at lea&s;t be obliged to provide for the &s;ecurity of the country again&s;t their incur&s;ions and depredations, by keeping up a force &s;ufficient to confine them within their own limits. It is natural too to &s;uppo&s;e, that the people's expectations of being protected will grow &s;tronger in pro|portion to the diminution of the enemy's force, and the greater facility with which it can be afforded. They will hardly be content to continue in a &s;tate of alarm and in&s;ecurity from a force &s;o incon&s;iderable, while the principal &s;trength of the States is drawn out in the pro&s;ecution of remote objects. If this rea&s;oning is ju&s;t, we &s;hall be oblig|ed
<PB N="325" REF="029737_0663_0FE29DCD6BAB2F18">
to have a larger force than the enemy, po&s;ted in differ|ent places to prevent &s;udden inroads which they would oth|erwi&s;e be able to make at different points: and the num|ber required cannot be e&s;timated at le&s;s than twelve or fif|teen thou&s;and men. This will be two-thirds as large a force as we have been able to rai&s;e and maintain during the progre&s;s of the war, as the&s;e calculations both of the ene|my's &s;trength and of our own are meant to de&s;ignate the number of effective rank and file.</P>
<P>If I rightly under&s;tand the plan in con&s;ideration, it re|quires for its execution twelve thou&s;and &s;ix hundred men rank and file. Be&s;ides the&s;e, to open pa&s;&s;ages through a wilderne&s;s, for the march of the &s;everal bodies of troops, to provide the means of long and difficult tran&s;portations by land and water, to e&s;tabli&s;h po&s;ts of communication for the &s;ecurity of our conveys, to build and man ve&s;&s;els of force nece&s;&s;ary for acquiring a &s;uperiority on the lakes,&mdash;the&s;e and many other purpo&s;es peculiar to the&s;e enterpri&s;es, which would be tedious in detail, will demand a much larger pro|portion of artificers and per&s;ons to be employed in man|ual and laborious offices, than are u&s;ual in the ordinary cour&s;e of military operations. When we add the whole together, the aggregate number of men requi&s;ite for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing campaign will be little le&s;s than dou|ble the number heretofore in the field: but, to be more certain in the calculation, it may be placed at only one half more.</P>
<P>Experience is the only rule to judge by in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Every expedient has been exhau&s;ted in the preced|ing campaigns to rai&s;e men; and it was found impo&s;&s;ible to get together a greater force than we had, though the &s;afety and &s;ucce&s;s of the cau&s;e &s;eemed ab&s;olutely to require it. The natural and direct inference therefore is, that the re|&s;ources of the country were inadequate to a larger &s;upply. I cannot then &s;ee that we can hope upon any principle to be equal to &s;o much greater exertions next year, when the people and the army appear to grow daily more tired of the war, and the depreciation of our money continually increa&s;|ing, and of con&s;equence proving a &s;maller temptation to in|duce them to engage.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="029737_0664_0FE29D6D5D365520">
The &s;tate of our &s;upplies for tran&s;porting and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting the troops will &s;tand upon a footing equally bad. We have encountered extreme difficulties in the&s;e re&s;pects, and have found that it was full as much as we were competent to, to feed the army we have already had, and enable it to keep the field and perform the movements required by the con|tingencies of the &s;ervice. It is not likely that the&s;e diffi|culties will dimini&s;h; but on the contrary they will rather multiply as the value of our currency le&s;&s;ens: and the enor|mous prices to which provi&s;ions have ri&s;en, and the artifi|cial &s;carcity created by monopolies, with what we have to fear from the effect of the &s;ame &s;pirit, give us no rea&s;on to flatter our&s;elves that our future pro&s;pects can be much better.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of things we are hardly warranted to ex|pect that we &s;hall have it in our power to &s;atisfy the de|mands of numbers &s;o much greater than we have yet had to &s;upply, e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider that the &s;cene of our operations has hitherto been in the heart of the country furni&s;hing our re&s;ources, which of cour&s;e facilitated the drawing them out,&mdash;and that we &s;hall then be carrying on the war at an immen&s;e di&s;tance, in a country wild and un|cultivated, incapable of affording any aid, and great part of it ho&s;tile. We cannot in this ca&s;e depend on temporary or occa&s;ional &s;upplies as we have been accu&s;tomed, but mu&s;t have ample magazines laid up beforehand. The labour and expen&s;e in forming the&s;e, and tran&s;porting the nece&s;&s;a|ry &s;tores of every kind for the u&s;e of the troops, will be in|crea&s;ed to a degree that can be more ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed. The tran&s;portation mu&s;t be, a great part of the way, through de&s;erts affording no other forage than herb|age: and, from this circum&s;tance, our principal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the fle&s;h kind mu&s;t be &s;alted, which would not only be an additional expen&s;e in the additional con&s;umption of &s;o &s;carce and dear an article as &s;alt, but would greatly increa&s;e the difficulty both of providing and tran&s;porting. My let|ter of the twenty-ninth ultimo (tran&s;mitting a copy of one from the quarter-ma&s;ter-general) which I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing to Congre&s;s, and to which I wi&s;h to refer, will point out the difficulties and daily expen&s;e attending our &s;upplies of the article of flour only, in our pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="327" REF="029737_0665_0FE29DD6838C8220">
exclu&s;ive of its co&s;t,&mdash;and lay the foundation for a &s;ort of comparative e&s;timate to be formed of tho&s;e that would attend the &s;upport of the troops when employed at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o great a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>If, in addition to all this, we &s;hould have the French fleet to &s;upply during the winter,&mdash;the likelihood of which I have no &s;ufficient information to ground a judgment up|on,&mdash;it will appear &s;till more impracticable to furni&s;h the &s;upplies requi&s;ite for the exten&s;ive operations propo&s;ed. But, independent of this, the improbability of doing it is, in my apprehen&s;ion, infinitely too great to ju&s;tify the un|dertaking.</P>
<P>This rea&s;oning is founded on a &s;uppo&s;ition that the ene|my do not evacuate their pre&s;ent po&s;ts at New-York and Rhode-I&s;land: nor can we pre&s;ume upon any pa&s;t appear|ances &s;o far as to determine the contrary, and enter into a national contract, the fulfilment of which at any rate, in my judgment, will depend on this event. Opinions on the &s;ubject are various, and the arguments on both &s;ides cogent. Circum&s;tances have hitherto been very indeci&s;ive: at Rhode-I&s;land there is nothing that looks like an evacua|tion, that I have heard of:&mdash;at New-York, the length of time elap&s;ed &s;ince the event has been expected, which can|not be &s;atisfactorily accounted for, makes it not a little doubtful and problematical.</P>
<P>But if it were even certain that the enemy would &s;hort|ly leave the&s;e States, I &s;hould think our ability to carry on the expeditions meditated (from the nature of the country, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> remotene&s;s from the &s;ource of our &s;upplies, joined to the di&s;couraging &s;tate of our finances) too precarious to authorize a pre-concerted agreement with a foreign power, binding our&s;elves to the attempt. On the other hand, if we were certain of our doing our part, a co-operation by the French would, in my opinion, be as delicate and pre|carious an enterpri&s;e as can be imagined. All the rea&s;ons, which induce France and the United States to wi&s;h to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t Canada and Halifax from the dominion of England, operate with her perhaps more forcibly to u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible effort for their defence. The lo&s;s of them would be a deadly blow to her trade and empire. To hope to find them in a defencele&s;s &s;tate, mu&s;t be founded in a &s;uppo&s;ition of the total
<PB N="328" REF="029737_0666_0FE29D789530D9B8">
incapacity of Britain both by land and &s;ea to ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ord them protection. I &s;hould apprehend we may run into a dan|gerous error by e&s;timating her power &s;o low.</P>
<P>We have been informed that a &s;trong garri&s;on has been lately &s;ent to Halifax, amounting, by report, to about four thou&s;and men:&mdash;a part of the detachments which the ene|my are now making from New-York are currently &s;aid to be, and in all probability are, de&s;tined for that place:&mdash;if they evacuate entirely, a very con&s;iderable part of their force will no doubt go there; and in any ca&s;e we may expect that reinforcements will be thrown from thence into Cana|da early in the &s;pring. The Engli&s;h are now greatly &s;upe|rior to the French by &s;ea in America, and will from every appearance continue &s;o unle&s;s Spain interpo&s;e,&mdash;an event which I do not know we are authorized to count upon. However, as I am de&s;titute of information with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of European politics, this is a point upon which I can form but an imperfect judgment: but if it &s;hould not take place, I think it infinitely probable, from the maritime &s;ituation and advantages of Halifax which is repre&s;ented as the fine&s;t port and be&s;t naval ar&s;enal in America,&mdash;from the &s;ecurity it is calculated to give to the general trade and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Britain, both on the conti|nent and in the We&s;t-Indies,&mdash;that it will be a &s;tation for a larger naval force than the one intended to convoy me French troops:&mdash;it will naturally be the principal rendez|vous of the Briti&s;h &s;hips of war in America. If this po&s;i|tion be admitted,&mdash;&s;hould the Engli&s;h have any knowledge or even &s;u&s;picion of the de&s;ign of the French court to &s;end a fleet up the river St. Laurence, nothing will be ea&s;ier than to intercept this fleet on its way, or to take or de&s;troy it after it has got in. Nor can we flatter our&s;elves with keeping this bu&s;ine&s;s a &s;ecret. Congre&s;s perhaps will be &s;urpri&s;ed to be told that it is already in more hands than they &s;u&s;pect: and, in the progre&s;s of the negociation in France, it will get into many more. The preparations will announce the intention. It is indeed a part of the plan to avow the de&s;tination of the French troops, though this is to be contradicted by the manner of their clothing, &amp;c. The &s;tationing of troops this winter, as is propo&s;ed, particu|larly on the Mohawk and Connecticut river, would be une|quivocal
<PB N="329" REF="029737_0667_0FE29DD98720C888">
proofs of the de&s;ign: it mu&s;t at lea&s;t excite the &s;tronge&s;t &s;u&s;picion, &s;o as to put the Engli&s;h nation upon their guard, and make them take precautions to counter|act it.</P>
<P>But if the French troops &s;hould arrive before Quebec, I think their &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t that &s;trong place, fortified by every advantage of nature and of art, would be extremely doubtful. It is &s;uppo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> this capital po&s;t will be found in &s;o weak a condition as to make its &s;urrender a matter of cour&s;e, owing to the enemy's having previou&s;ly drained them&s;elves for the defence of Detroit, Niagara, St. John's, Montr&eacute;al, &amp;c. but we cannot depend that this will be the ca&s;e:&mdash;they may e&s;teem it the part of prudence rather to &s;acrifice or at lea&s;t to hazard the extremities in order to collect their &s;trength at the heart. Montr&eacute;al in|deed, and the po&s;ts e&s;&s;ential to it, mu&s;t be defended, be|cau&s;e the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them would throw too large a part of the country into our hands. But if reinforcements are &s;ent to Canada early in the &s;pring,&mdash;a circum&s;tance ex|tremely likely,&mdash;the&s;e may be attended to without too far weakening the garri&s;on of Quebec; and, as before ob&s;erv|ed, we cannot build upon their conduct's being regulated by an ignorance of our plans. The French troops, in&s;tead of a coup-de-main, would in this ca&s;e be reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of carrying on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> blockade.</P>
<P>I will now take the liberty to turn my attention towards the operations of our own troops. The one again&s;t De|troit I &s;hall at pre&s;ent &s;ay nothing about: if well conduct|ed. I &s;hould hope that place would fall without very great difficulty. The ca&s;e is very different with re&s;pect to Nia|gara. This, I am informed, is one of the &s;tronge&s;t for|tre&s;&s;es in America, and can only be reduced by regular approaches or by famine. In accompli&s;hing this, la&s;t war, and a conque&s;t as far as Montr&egrave;al, I believe general Am|her&s;t exhau&s;ted two campaigns, with all the advantages which he derived from the united efforts of Britain and America, with every convenience for water-tran&s;portation, including plenty of &s;eamen, and with money that com|manded every thing which either country could furni&s;h. The former mode would require great per&s;everance, time, and labour, and an apparatus which it would be almo&s;t im|practicable
<PB N="330" REF="029737_0668_0FE29D7A17897F58">
to tran&s;port. The latter is practicable, but very difficult. To effect it, we mu&s;t gain a &s;uperiority on the lakes. The enemy have already a re&s;pectable force there:&mdash;if they &s;u&s;pect our de&s;ign, which they cannot fail to do from the mea&s;ures to be taken, they may improve the interval in adding to it; and, by providing materials and artificers upon the &s;pot, they may be able to increa&s;e it &s;o as to keep pace with us. It is therefore ea&s;y to &s;ee that we ought not to be too &s;anguine in the &s;ucce&s;s of this ex|pedition, and that, if a moderate force be employed in the defence of Niagara without degarni&s;hing Quebec and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">termediate po&s;ts, its reduction will be a very arduous ta&s;k.</P>
<P>The body of troops to penetrate by way of the river St. Franci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> mu&s;t meet with great ob&s;tacles: they will have a march of about a hundred and fifty miles from Coho&s;s, which is about a hundred and &s;ixty miles beyond Hartford, a great part of which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> through a hitherto-un|inhabited and trackle&s;s country, with an immen&s;e train of waggons: all the &s;tores and provi&s;ions for the whole march, and the future &s;upply of the troops, at lea&s;t till they &s;hould get footing in Canada, mu&s;t accompany them from the beginning. The impediments and delays in &s;uch a march almo&s;t exceed conception.</P>
<P>When arrived at the St. Laurence, fre&s;h ob&s;tacles probably would pre&s;ent them&s;elves. The pre&s;umption is, that, if the enemy could not make head there, they would de&s;ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e the country through which they were to pa&s;s, de|&s;troy all the provi&s;ion and forage, remove every kind of water craft, and demoli&s;h the materials for building others. The&s;e precautions being taken on the Sorelle and St. Laurence would pretty effectually ob&s;truct our progre&s;s both to Montr&eacute;al and Cadoroqui,&mdash;to &s;ay nothing of the rapidity of the current and the numerous rifts between Montreal and Legalette.</P>
<P>When we deliberately con&s;ider all the ob&s;tacles in the execution, and the difficulties we &s;hall find in preparing the va&s;t magazines required, which have been already enumerated, if within the compa&s;s of our re&s;ources, we &s;hall be led to think it not very improbable that this body may be unable to penetrate Canada, at lea&s;t in time to co|operate
<PB N="331" REF="029737_0669_0FE29DDB0B02B5D8">
operate with the French troops, if a co-operation &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary. The &s;ituation of the&s;e troops then would be delicate and dangerous:&mdash;expo&s;ed to a defeat from the united force of the enemy, in great danger of having their retreat cut off by a &s;uperior naval force in the river, they would have every thing to fear. On the other hand, if our operations &s;hould be as &s;ucce&s;sful as we may flatter our&s;elves, a tempe&s;t or a Briti&s;h fleet may deprive us of the expected aid; and at a critical moment we may find our&s;elves in the bo&s;om of an enemy's country, obliged to combat their whole force with one inferior and reduced by a tedious and wa&s;ting march. The five thou&s;and men, when they arrived in Canada, would probably little exceed four capable of &s;ervice; and would be &s;till le&s;s, if out of them we &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h po&s;ts as we advanced, to in&s;ure a retreat and protect e&s;corts of provi&s;ion which mu&s;t follow for future &s;upport. Thus an accident in either ca&s;e would involve the defeat of the whole project; and the cata&s;tro|phe might be attended with the mo&s;t unhappy con&s;equences to America.</P>
<P>The plan propo&s;ed appears to me not only too exten&s;ive and beyond our abilities, but too complex. To &s;ucceed, it requires &s;uch a fortunate coincidence of circum&s;tances as could hardly be hoped, and cannot be relied on;&mdash;the departure of the enemy from the&s;e States, without which we cannot furni&s;h the &s;tipulated force, or &s;upplies to main|tain them,&mdash;&s;uch a want of power or want of fore&s;ight in the enemy as will oblige them to neglect the reinforcement of Halifax and of Canada, and prevent them, however con|veniently &s;ituated, from di&s;puting the pa&s;&s;age of the four &s;hips of the line and four frigates up the river St. Lau|rence, or attempting their de&s;truction afterwards,&mdash;&s;uch a combination of favourable incidents as will enable &s;everal bodies acting &s;eparately and independently by &s;ea and land, and from different countries, to conform to times and pe|riods &s;o as to in&s;ure a co-operation;&mdash;the&s;e and many other circum&s;tances mu&s;t con&s;pire, to give &s;ucce&s;s to the enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s, I am per&s;uaded, had powerful rea&s;ons for fix|ing the convoy at the number they have: and their &s;upe|rior information re&s;pecting the affairs of Europe at this
<PB N="332" REF="029737_0670_0FE29D7B9C27EA90">
juncture enables them to judge much better than I can pretend to do, of its &s;ufficiency. But, from the imperfect view I have of the matter, I have been led, in con&s;idering the &s;ubject, to look upon it as in&s;ufficient. From the gen|eral tenor of intelligence, the Engli&s;h out-number the French in the channel: in America, both on the conti|nent and in the i&s;lands, they are greatly &s;uperior. If the the la&s;t Toulon fleet is employed in the Mediterranean, the French may have the &s;uperiority there: but, upon the whole, the balance of naval force &s;eems hitherto to be on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h. If we add to this that the number of &s;hips of war in the French ports, built or building, bears no compari&s;on to the number in the Engli&s;h ports, and that Britain, notwith&s;tanding the diminution &s;he has &s;uffered, is &s;till a kingdom of great maritime re&s;ources,&mdash;we &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed to conclude that the preponderance is too like|ly to continue where it is. The interpo&s;ition of Spain in|deed would make a very intere&s;ting change: but her back|wardne&s;s heretofore &s;eems to be an argument that &s;he is withheld from interfering by &s;ome weighty political mo|tives: and how long the&s;e may continue to re&s;train her, is a que&s;tion I am unqualified to determine.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e general objections to the plan which have been &s;tated, there appear to me to be &s;ome particular ones which I &s;hall take the liberty to point out.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place I ob&s;erve there are to be five thou&s;and militia employed in the two expeditions again&s;t Detroit and Niagara. The drawing into &s;ervice &s;o large a number compo&s;ed chiefly of hu&s;bandmen, in addition to what may be found nece&s;&s;ary for other exigencies on the coa&s;t at &s;o intere&s;ting a &s;ea&s;on of the year, will certainly be very inju|rious to the culture of our lands, and mu&s;t tend to add to the deficiency of &s;upplies. But this, though not to be overlooked, is not the principal objection. In the expe|dition again&s;t Detroit, militia perhaps may an&s;wer, as it is not a po&s;t of very great &s;trength, and may po&s;&s;ibly be aban|doned, on or in a little time after the approach of a force that cannot be oppo&s;ed in the field, and the garri&s;on pro|ceed to reinforce that of Niagara. But even here troops of another kind would be far preferable. However, the ca&s;e will be very different with re&s;pect to this la&s;t:&mdash;it is,
<PB N="333" REF="029737_0671_0FE29DDC8EAAAF38">
as I have before mentioned, one of the &s;tronge&s;t fortre&s;&s;es of America, and demands for its reduction the very be&s;t of troops. Militia have neither patience nor per&s;everance for a &s;iege. This has been demon&s;trated by all the expe|rience we have had. An attempt to carry on one which &s;hould materially depend on them would be liable to be fru&s;trated by their incon&s;tancy in the mo&s;t critical moments. Agreeable to the plan under con&s;ideration, three thou&s;and five hundred out of five thou&s;and &s;ix hundred are to be militia.</P>
<P>It is a part of the plan that the troops &s;ent again&s;t De|troit, whether &s;ucce&s;sful or not, are to form a junction with tho&s;e at Niagara. It appears to me on the contrary, that the expedition again&s;t Detroit, under the pre&s;ent arrange|ment, mu&s;t &s;tand on its own bottom, and have no other object than the reducing that place and de&s;troying the ad|jacent Indian &s;ettlements. Lake Erie is certainly occu|pied by two armed ve&s;&s;els of &s;ixteen and eighteen guns, and, it is &s;aid, by five or &s;ix others of &s;maller &s;ize, having two, three, or four guns each, which, while the enemy hold Niagara, will prevent the communication of our troops by way of the lake,&mdash;to &s;ay nothing of the want of bat|teaux for tran&s;portation. A communication by land mu&s;t be performed through an extent of more than four hundred miles, and a great part of this at lea&s;t under many di&s;ad|vantages of route, and through tribes of ho&s;tile Indians.</P>
<P>My knowledge of the country is not &s;ufficiently accu|rate to enable me to di&s;cover the rea&s;ons which determined Congre&s;s to divide the force de&s;tined again&s;t Niagara, and to appoint the march of one body from Ononguaga to that place. It &s;eems to me however that this di&s;po&s;ition might be &s;ubject to one great inconvenience, which is, that, if each column be not &s;uperior to the whole collective force of the enemy, they ri&s;k being beaten &s;eparately and &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively, be&s;ides the trouble and expen&s;e of preparing as it were for two expeditions in&s;tead of one,&mdash;of opening two roads in&s;tead of one,&mdash;and the uncertainty of a co-opera|tion (if no di&s;a&s;ter &s;hould happen to either) at the moment when it might be nece&s;&s;ary. The inquiries I have as yet had it in my power to make are oppo&s;ed to the practicabil|ity of conveying cannon in the route from Ononguaga to
<PB N="334" REF="029737_0672_0FE29D7D1F475AD0">
Niagara, or at lea&s;t place it as a point infinitely doubtful: and, without cannon, nothing can be effected again&s;t that po&s;t. Upon the whole, the great matter e&s;&s;ential to &s;uc|ce&s;s again&s;t Niagara is to &s;ubdue the enemy's force on lakes Erie and Ontario, particularly the latter. This once done, and the garri&s;on by that means cut off from its &s;upplies, the fort will be likely to fall an ea&s;y prey. Here our ef|forts &s;hould be directed: nor do I at pre&s;ent perceive the purpo&s;es to be an&s;wered by the body going from Onon|guaga, unle&s;s the deva&s;tation of the intermediate Indian villages be the object,&mdash;which perhaps may not be equal to the ri&s;k, labour and expen&s;e, and the more &s;o as they would fall of cour&s;e if we &s;hould &s;ucceed in the general operation.</P>
<P>The cantoning five thou&s;and troops this winter or Con|necticut-river, under our pre&s;ent pro&s;pects, will in my opin|ion be impracticable, and, in any ca&s;e, unadvi&s;eable. When I had the honour of writing to Congre&s;s in September la&s;t on the &s;ubject of a winter campaign into Canada, I had been led by [<HI>colonel</HI>] Bailey, and other gentlemen ac|quainted with the country, to expect that very con&s;idera|ble magazines of provi&s;ions might be laid up on the upper parts of that river. But it appears on experiment that their zeal for the expedition made them too &s;anguine in the matter. The purcha&s;es fall far, very far &s;hort of what was expected. The difficulties of tran&s;portation, as rep|re&s;ented by the quarter-ma&s;ters and commi&s;&s;aries, &s;upported by facts that &s;peak for them&s;elves, are &s;o great and com|plicated that I &s;hould have no hope of being able, from remote parts of the continent, to throw in the quantity requi&s;ite for &s;ub&s;i&s;ting the&s;e troops during the winter, and at the &s;ame time of forming the magazines which would be nece&s;&s;ary to pro&s;ecute the expedition in &s;pring. We may be endeavouring to form the magazines: but the troops cannot be on the &s;pot this winter; otherwi&s;e they will exhau&s;t the provi&s;ion as fa&s;t as it can be collected. The &s;ame objection applies to the &s;tationing of troops on the Mohawk-river.</P>
<P>In e&s;timating our force for the next campaign, it is to be con&s;idered that upwards of four thou&s;and of the pre&s;ent army will have completed their term of &s;ervice by the la&s;t
<PB N="335" REF="029737_0673_0FE29DE49C006D30">
of May next, and that a great proportion of the remainder will have done the &s;ame about the clo&s;e of the en&s;uing fall, unle&s;s they can be induced to re-engage,&mdash;of which the ill &s;ucce&s;s of our pre&s;ent exertions to enli&s;t tho&s;e who&s;e en|gagements are about to expire affords but an unfavourable pro&s;pect. This and the general temper of the officers, di&s;&s;atisfied much with their &s;ituation, will &s;ugge&s;t a &s;trong argument again&s;t the exten&s;ive projects in contemplation.</P>
<P>In whatever point of light the &s;ubject is placed, our abili|ty to perform our part of the contract appears to me in|finitely too doubtful and precarious to ju&s;tify the undertak|ing. A failure, as I have already ob&s;erved, would involve con&s;equences too delicate and di&s;agreeable to be hazarded. But, at the &s;ame time that my judgment is again&s;t this, I am clearly of opinion that we &s;hould attempt every thing that our circum&s;tances will permit: but, as the extent of our power mu&s;t be regulated by many po&s;&s;ible events, I would wi&s;h to hold our&s;elves free to act according to either po&s;&s;ibility, and as a clearer view of our future re&s;ources may authorize. If the enemy entirely leave the&s;e States, it will produce a va&s;t change in our affairs; and new pro&s;|pects may open, of which we can at pre&s;ent have but a very imperfect idea. It would be a great &s;tep towards rai&s;ing the value of our money, which would give a new &s;pring to our military operations. We may be able to un|dertake much more than we can now fore&s;ee.</P>
<P>If the enemy attempt to keep po&s;ts in the&s;e States, a primary object will be to expel them, if in our power: If not, we mu&s;t make proper provi&s;ion to bar their depreda|tions, and mu&s;t turn our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tention to the &s;ecurity of our frontiers, by pur&s;uing &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hall be within the reach of our abilities. Though we may not be able to launch into &s;o wide a field as we could wi&s;h, &s;omething upon a more partial &s;cale may be enterpri&s;ed. Detroit and Niagara may perhaps be reduced, though Canada may not be an acce&s;&s;ion to the confederacy. With a view to what is po&s;&s;ible, preparations may be going on, and we can make &s;uch an application of them as we &s;hall find practicable.</P>
<P>As there is no time to be lo&s;t in doing this, I &s;hall give the nece&s;&s;ary orders &s;o far as relates to the article of pro|vi&s;ion,
<PB N="336" REF="029737_0674_0FE29D87F2C75420">
which indeed has been already done in part. Mag|azines of forage, materials for boat and &s;hip building, and other articles, mu&s;t al&s;o be provided,&mdash;which will depend on the final arrangements and more definitive in&s;tructions of Congre&s;s. The&s;e mea&s;ures will be nece&s;&s;ary to be tak|en, whether the pre&s;ent plan is carried on, or whether &s;ome|thing le&s;s exten&s;ive, depending wholly on our&s;elves, is &s;ub|&s;tituted in its place. I &s;hall wait the further orders of Congre&s;s for the government of my conduct in delivering the plan to the marquis as their re&s;olution &s;eems to require, or in tran&s;mitting it immediately to doctor Franklin as the letter from the committee &s;eems to direct.

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honour to tran&s;mit you the copy of a letter of the tenth in&s;tant, which I received ye&s;terday from Sir Henry Clinton, on the &s;ubject of exchanging the pri&s;oners of the convention. Should the propo&s;ition be agreeable to Congre&s;s, I &s;hall be glad to receive powers to enter into a negociation as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, as it may probably relieve our officers upon parole from the di&s;agree|able nece&s;&s;ity of returning to New-York. I will ju&s;t ob|&s;erve, that, &s;hould an exchange take place upon the terms propo&s;ed by Sir Henry, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hall not be obliged to give up any con&s;iderable number of privates by way of compo&s;ition, as the officers of the convention (&s;hould the whole be &s;uffered to be exchanged) would go a great way towards liberating ours at pre&s;ent in the hands of the enemy. But it cannot be expected that they will leave their troops entirely de&s;titute of officers.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour to receive your favour of the &s;ixth ye&s;terday, with the inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from the pre&s;|ident of the council of New-Jer&s;ey, relative to an expect|ed attack upon the we&s;tern frontier of that State. I have ju&s;t received a letter from general Hand giving intelligence of an attack upon colonel Alden's regiment at Cherry-Valley, effected by &s;urpri&s;e, in con&s;equence of which, there is too much rea&s;on to apprehend that regiment may fall a &s;acrifice. I tran&s;mit a copy of the di&s;patches announcing this di&s;agreeable affair.</P>
<P>The&s;e depredations of the enemy give me the mo&s;t &s;eri|ous concern. I lament that we have not yet had it in our power to give them an effectual check. I am perfectly convinced that the only certain way of preventing Indian ravages is to carry the war vigorou&s;ly into their own coun|try. But as this is thought impracticable at this late &s;ea|&s;on of the year from the &s;tate of the water, and other im|pediments, I fear we mu&s;t content our&s;elves with defen|&s;ive precautions for the pre&s;ent. I have already informed Congre&s;s that colonel Cortlandt's regiment had marched towards the Mini&s;inks: but, having &s;ince directed count Pula&s;ki to proceed with his corps to Colesfort in that neigh|bourhood, colonel Cortlandt will take po&s;t &s;omewhere be|tween that place and Roche&s;ter. Orders are now given to colonel Spencer's regiment and colonel Armand's corps to join general Pula&s;ki. This di&s;po&s;ition is agreeable to the opinion of governor Clinton and other gentlemen ac|quainted with the country whom I have con&s;ulted, and is calculated to cover the ea&s;tern frontier of Penn&s;ylvania, New-Jer&s;ey, and the we&s;tern part of New-York. I &s;hall al&s;o immediately &s;end the remainder of general Clinton's brigade to Albany. When arrived there, if any thing of|fen&s;ive can po&s;&s;ibly be undertaken, it &s;hall be done: if not, they will be di&s;po&s;ed of in a manner that &s;hall &s;eem be&s;t adapted for protection and defence.

<P>MR. Wheelock will have the honour of pre&s;enting this letter to your excellency. He waits on Congre&s;s up|on the affairs of a regiment under the command of colonel Bedel, which, it &s;eems, was rai&s;ed in the Coho&s;s county, or at lea&s;t has been kept up &s;ince March la&s;t upon the recommendation of the marquis Fayette when at Albany. This corps, according to the inclo&s;ed &s;tate by Mr.

Wheelock who is the lieutenant colonel, to which I beg leave to refer Congre&s;s, and according to other information I have received, was at fir&s;t a&s;&s;embled under the direction of major-general Gates about this time twelvemonth for the purpo&s;e of a &s;udden enterpri&s;e again&s;t St. John's, and the enemy's armed ve&s;&s;els lying there, and was engaged till the la&s;t of March.</P>
<P>I cannot undertake to &s;ay in what manner or how u&s;e|fully this regiment has been employed, or to what extent in point of men. But Mr. Wheelock &s;ays it has been of great &s;ervice: and the object of his pre&s;ent journey is to obtain the direction of Congre&s;s for their being paid when proper rolls are produced, and their determination whether it is to be di&s;banded now, or continued till April next, the period for which the men are &s;aid to have engaged, though the marquis's recommendation extended only to the end of the pre&s;ent campaign.</P>
<P>The regiment may or may not be nece&s;&s;ary in future. Much will depend on the &s;y&s;tem of conduct the enemy pur&s;ue the next campaign, and on our own operations. I would ob&s;erve, under its pre&s;ent engagement, its &s;ervices were to be local, or at lea&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to a certain quarter.

<P>I HAD the honour of your excellency's two favours of the fourteenth and fifteenth in&s;tant, with their &s;everal inclo&s;ures. The con&s;ideration of doctor Conolly's ca&s;e, with the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, I have tran&s;mitted to Sir. Henry Clinton.</P>
<P>In my letter of the &s;ixteenth I communicated to your excellency the attempt on Fort Alden by the &s;avages. I have &s;ince received the inclo&s;ed di&s;patches confirming that

<P>I have to regret that the condition of affairs is &s;uch as does not admit of a compliance with repeated detachments from this army. However, that every thing po&s;&s;ible might be done under our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, general Hand was further in&s;tructed on the &s;ixteenth in&s;tant to confer with general Schuyler at Albany, and with tho&s;e per&s;ons in that part of the country who could in any manner a&s;&s;i&s;t in forming his judgment on the be&s;t mea&s;ures to be pur|&s;ued with the troops which were employed in the &s;everal quarters: and ye&s;terday I changed his command to that of the Mini&s;inks, and forwarded him an extract from colo|nel Hartley's letter of the ninth, that he might accommo|date his di&s;po&s;itions to recent events. I have only to add on this &s;ubject, that, on the twentieth, brigadier-general Clinton &s;et out to take the command at Albany, with di|rections to con&s;ult with general Hand, and to form with him &s;uch combined arrangements as may appear mo&s;t con|&s;i&s;tent with their united &s;trength.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR excellency's letter of the eighteenth, with the inclo&s;ure referred to, came to hand ye&s;terday. I had be|fore received the intelligence contained in Mr. Deane's letter, and in con&s;equence made part of the detachments which have been mentioned in my late letters. It is high|ly probable that the late incur&s;ions and outrages were com|mitted by the parties comprehended in Mr. Deane's in|telligence; and I &s;hould hope that the force already gone from the army, together with the &s;ea&s;on, will prevent them at lea&s;t from making further great depredations.</P>
<P>Since I had the honour of addre&s;&s;ing your excellency on the twenty-fir&s;t, I received a letter from general Hand, of the eighteenth, an extract from which you will find inclo&s;|ed, with copies of a letter from major Whiting and one from a Mr. Clyde. The&s;e will inform Congre&s;s, that though the ravages at the Cherry-Valley &s;ettlement were great in the late attack by the &s;avages, yet our lo&s;s was much le&s;s than we had rea&s;on to apprehend it from our former advices. The account of the enemy's having &s;tormed the fort, and cut off Alden's regiment, happily turns out premature. The inclo&s;ure, N^o 2, which is a copy of a letter from lord Stirling, of the &s;eventeenth, will advi&s;e Congre&s;s that the fleet of tran&s;ports, which had lain at the Hook for &s;ome days before, came up the preceding night to the watering-place, and al&s;o that &s;ome of the &s;hips of wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> had returned to York di&s;ma&s;ted. Your excellency will al&s;o &s;ee by the inclo&s;ure, N^o 3, (which contains an extract, from a letter from general Sullivan, of the eigh|teenth in&s;tant) the late&s;t advices I have re&s;pecting admiral Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">'s fleet. From the lo&s;s of the Somer&s;et, and the&s;e &s;everal accounts, they &s;uffered &s;everely in their late crui&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 24. I ju&s;t received from general Hand the inclo&s;ed petition from major Whitcomb, addre&s;&s;ed to Con|gre&s;s, and his letter to general Hand, of the &s;ame date.
<PB N="344" REF="029737_0682_0FE29D966ED8F738">
My information re&s;pecting the corps under major Whit|comb's command has hitherto been very imperfect; and even now I do not know the terms on which it was en|gaged: nor had I, till the&s;e letters came to hand, any rea|&s;on to think that the troops above had not all been equally paid,&mdash;having &s;ent up a &s;upply of money for the purpo&s;e &s;oon after I came to this camp, and authorized the pay-ma&s;ter-general a few days ago to forward a further quantity. I &s;hall immediately write to general Clinton, now on his way to Albany, to &s;end a proper officer to mu&s;ter the corps, and al&s;o three companies (which he calls provincials) un|der his direction, &s;aid to be engaged to the fir&s;t of next month;&mdash;after which, both will be paid on his pre&s;enting proper rolls. With re&s;pect to clothing, the only applica|tion I recollect to have had from major Whitcomb was an&s;wered with &s;uch &s;upplies, both in quantity and quality, as our &s;tores at the time would admit of. It may perhaps be practicable hereafter to put his corps on a better footing in this in&s;tance.</P>
<P>The alarm which major Whitcomb &s;peaks of in the be|ginning of his letter to general Hand was occa&s;ioned (as Congre&s;s will perceive by a copy of another letter from him to general Hand) by a de&s;cent made by a body of the enemy in the country about the &s;outh end of Lake Cham|plain, and who, according to his report, have done con&s;id|erable damage.</P>
<P>I directed general Du Portail &s;ome time ago to take a view of the works carrying on in the Highlands for the defence of the North-river, and to make an e&s;timate of the cannon nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e. This he did; and, as he is now at Philadelphia, I have written to him by this conveyance, and reque&s;ted him to pre&s;ent the e&s;timate to Congre&s;s. I am &s;orry the number wanted is &s;o great, and the more &s;o as I find upon inquiry that the Sali&s;bury fur|nace in Connecticut, which u&s;ed to ca&s;t &s;o many, is much out of repair, and could not po&s;&s;ibly be put in order, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in a proper &s;tate for &s;upplies, before May.

We mu&s;t in the cour&s;e of things have occa&s;ion for a great deal of artillery: and, in any enterpri&s;e we may undertake again&s;t Canada, whether on a large or a &s;mall &s;cale, &s;ever|al pieces of various calibers will be ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential. Be&s;ides arming the &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els we &s;hall be obliged to build to gain the navigation of the lakes, our land opera|tions will require a great number.</P>
<P>A detachment of continental troops will conduct tho&s;e of the convention from the North-river to the Delaware. The German battalion is to compo&s;e part of the e&s;cort: and, after the convention troops cro&s;s to Penn&s;ylvania, I have directed it, in con&s;equence of the intelligence tran&s;|mitted of late by Congre&s;s re&s;pecting the frontiers, to pro|ceed to Ea&s;ton with all its baggage, where it is to wait till general Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d arrives at the Mini&s;inks, and whence it will be ready to act as circum&s;tances may require. At the &s;ame time, if the&s;e frequent detachments from the army could be avoided, it were much to be wi&s;hed. The troops will be by this means in a very di&s;per&s;ed &s;tate; and, be|&s;ides lo&s;ing perhaps &s;ome advantages which might pre&s;ent them&s;elves if they were more collected, their di&s;cipline will be greatly injured, and it will be extremely difficult, from a variety of cau&s;es, to draw them together again: and, if it &s;hould be practicable, it is highly probable we &s;hall find their number much impaired by de&s;ertion and otherwi&s;e.</P>

<P>MR. John Dodge will have the honour of delivering this letter to your excellency. His hi&s;tory is that he is a native of Connecticut, and about eight years ago, as he informs me, &s;ettled in the country between Detroit and Pitt&s;burg as an Indian trader;&mdash;that he carried on com|merce till January 1776, when, for his attachment to our cau&s;e and the mea&s;ures he had taken to promote it, he be|came obnoxious to the enemy, was &s;eized by order of the governor of Detroit, was thrown into pri&s;on, and there continued till the beginning of May la&s;t, when he was &s;ent to Quebec;&mdash;that on the ninth of October he e&s;caped
<PB N="346" REF="029737_0684_0FE29D99880C1EA0">
from thence and got into our &s;ettlements, through the aid of a French Caghnewaga who came with him&punc; here on Friday la&s;t.</P>
<P>I find Mr. Dodge an intelligent young man, intimately acquainted with all the tract of country between Pitt&s;burg and Detroit, and with that lying on Lake Erie, al&s;o with mo&s;t of the &s;avage tribes in tho&s;e parts, and with their languages. He is likewi&s;e well acquainted with the com|munication from Fort Stanwix to O&s;wego and Niagara.</P>
<P>I believe Mr. Dodge's hi&s;tory to be true; and, from a variety of circum&s;tances, I am per&s;uaded of his firm at|tachment to us: and I would take the liberty to &s;ugge&s;t to Congre&s;s that I think he may be of very important &s;er|vice to us in any enterpri&s;e we may undertake in the we&s;t|ern quarter, or again&s;t the force on Lake Erie or Lake Ontario. This con&s;ideration, with that of his lo&s;&s;es and &s;uffering<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> which I am inclined to believe have been con|&s;iderable, &s;eem to make him worthy of notice and atten|tion. His information is good and clear in &s;everal points which I know my&s;elf, and in many others, (from the man|ner in which he delivered it) far &s;uperior and much more &s;atisfactory than what I have been able to derive from any other per&s;on. As I have ob&s;erved before, Mr. Dodge ap|pears to me a valuable intelligencer; and, if Congre&s;s are plea&s;ed to honour him with an opportunity, he will give them an account of the po&s;ts of Detroit and Niagara when he left them, and of that at Michilimachinac,&mdash;of the ene|my's naval force on lakes Erie and Ontario, and of &s;uch other matters in Canada as he was able to inform him|&s;elf of, either by his own ob&s;ervation or the relation of others.</P>
<P>General Gates &s;upplied Mr. Dodge with &s;ome money to defray his expen&s;es from Bo&s;ton to this place, and I have advanced him to-day a hundred and fifty dollars more to carry him to Philadelphia.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS ye&s;terday honoured with your favour of the twentieth, with its &s;everal inclo&s;ures. Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to accept my acknowledgments for the communi|cation of the treaties between his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty and the United States. The re&s;olve re&s;pecting the ex|change of pri&s;oners has been tran&s;mitted to Sir Henry Clinton, and I have appointed commi&s;&s;ioners (if he thinks proper) to meet his at Amboy the &s;eventh of next month.</P>
<P>I have the plea&s;ure to inform Congre&s;s that the whole army (one brigade and the light corps excepted) is now in motion to the places of their re&s;pective cantonments for winter-quarters. I have thought it prudent to delay this event a while, to give time for the convention troops to make &s;ome progre&s;s in cro&s;&s;ing the North-river, to prevent a po&s;&s;ibility of accident. The third divi&s;ion pa&s;&s;es this day; and, if no unexpected interruption happens, the whole will be over, the thirtieth in&s;tant. When their pa&s;&s;age is com|pleted, the remaining troops kept in the field will imme|diately retire to quarters.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition for winter-quarters is as follows.&mdash;Nine brigades will be &s;tationed on the we&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's river, exclu&s;ive of the garri&s;on at We&s;t-Point,&mdash;one of which (the North-Carolina brigade) will be near Smith's Clove for the &s;ecurity of that pa&s;s, and as a reinforcement to We&s;t-Point in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity; another (the Jer&s;ey brigade) will be at Elizabethtown, to cover the lower part of Jer&s;ey; and the other &s;even, con&s;i&s;ting of the Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Penn&s;ylvania troops, will be at Middlebrook. Six brigades will be left on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river and at We&s;t-Point;&mdash;three of which (of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts troops) will be &s;tationed for the immediate defence of the Highlands; one at We&s;t-Point in addition to the garri&s;on already there; and the other two at Fi&s;h-kill and the Continental Village. The remaining three brigades, compo&s;ed of the New-Hamp&s;hire and Connecti|cut troops, and Hazen's regiment, will be po&s;ted in the
<PB N="348" REF="029737_0686_0FE29D9B134C6248">
vicinity of Danbury, for the protection of the country ly|ing along the Sound, to cover our magazines lying on Connecticut-river, and to aid the Highlands on any &s;erious movement of the enemy that way. The park of artillery will be at Pluckemin. The cavalry will be di&s;po&s;ed of thus:&mdash;Bland's regiment at Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">che&s;ter in Virginia, Bay|lor's at Frederic or Hagar&s;town in Maryland, Moylan's at Lanca&s;ter in Penn&s;ylvania, and Sheldon's at Durham in Connecticut. Lee's corps will be with that part of the army which is in the Jer&s;eys acting on the advanced po&s;ts. This comprehends the general di&s;tribution of the army, except Clinton's brigade of New-York troops, Pula&s;ki's corps, and &s;ome detached regiments and corps &s;tationed at Albany and at different parts of the frontier, of which Congre&s;s have already been particularly advi&s;ed. General Putnam will command at Danbury, General M^cDougal in the Highlands, and my own quarters will be in the Jer|&s;eys, in the neighbourhood of Middlebrook.</P>
<P>This di&s;po&s;ition appeared to me be&s;t calculated to con|ciliate as far as po&s;&s;ible the&s;e &s;everal objects,&mdash;the protec|tion of the country, the &s;ecurity of the important po&s;ts in the Highlands, the &s;afety, di&s;cipline, and ea&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the army. To have kept the troops in a collected &s;tate would have increa&s;ed infinitely the expen&s;e and difficulty of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting them, both with re&s;pect to forage and provi|&s;ions: to have divided them into &s;maller cantonments would have made it far le&s;s practicable to maintain order and di&s;cipline among them, and would have put them le&s;s in a condition to control and prevent offen&s;ive operations on the &s;ide of the enemy, or to a&s;&s;emble to take advantage of any favourable opening which their future &s;ituation may offer, &s;hould they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> weaken them&s;elves by further detachments &s;o far as to invite an enterpri&s;e again&s;t them.</P>
<P>By the e&s;timate of the quarter-ma&s;ter and commi&s;&s;ary-general, it appears indi&s;pen&s;able to have the principal part of the army on the other &s;ide of the North-river. It was thought impracticable to furni&s;h the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of flour for the whole, on this &s;ide the river, from the im|men&s;e difficulty and expen&s;e of tran&s;portation in the win|ter &s;ea&s;on, and from the exhau&s;ted &s;tate of the country with re&s;pect to forage. As this &s;ubject has been already
<PB N="349" REF="029737_0687_0FE29DFD39593A88">
fully before Congre&s;s, I &s;hall not trouble them with a rep|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ition of the detail. In order as much as po&s;&s;ible to re|duce the demand of forage and facilitate the &s;upplies, I have given directions, when the &s;everal divi&s;ions arrive at their cantonments, to &s;end away to convenient places at a di&s;tance from them all the hor&s;es not ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to carry on the ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of the army.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to add that the troops mu&s;t again have recour&s;e to the expedient of hutting as they did la&s;t year. But, as they are now well clad, and we have had more lei&s;ure to make &s;ome little preparations for winter-quarters, I hope they will be in a more comfortable &s;ituation than they were in the preceding winter.

He propo&s;ed to make his fir&s;t &s;tage at Acquake|nunk, and to proceed as his future intelligence might re|quire. He is much at a lo&s;s to determine the de&s;ign of the enemy, but thinks it may either have re&s;pect to the forts in the Highlands or to the convention troops.</P>
<P>When he left Peek&s;kill, the two Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts brigades, on their march thither from Hartford, were not arrived, &s;o that the troops on the &s;pot were only the original garri|&s;on of We&s;t-Point, and Nixon's brigade which lay near the Continental Village: but, without the mo&s;t inexplica|ble delay, tho&s;e mu&s;t have reached their de&s;tination &s;ome days &s;ince. If &s;o, and the enemy &s;hould meditate a &s;troke again&s;t We&s;t-Point, they will probably fail in it unle&s;s there &s;hould be &s;omething like a &s;urpri&s;e. The general al&s;o thinks it probable that the Maryland divi&s;ion were ye&s;terday even|ing at the Clove. Their in&s;tructions were, to communicate with We&s;t-Point and reinforce it on any emergency. They were, in addition to them, directed la&s;t night by expre&s;s to move immediately towards the forts, dive&s;ted of baggage and artillery, for the more &s;peedy communication. The Carolina brigade has been &s;ome time &s;tationed at the en|trance of the Clove.</P>
<P>One brigade of the Virginia troops is at Pompton, and the other two were expected to reach Springfield ye&s;terday. The Penn&s;ylvania troops, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, would be at Ac|quakenunk or in the neighbourhood of Paramus. The&s;e troops, immediately on receiving the pre&s;ent intelligence,
<PB N="351" REF="029737_0689_0FE29E17EC297738">
were ordered to halt; and his excellency is gone forward to regulate their movements according to circum&s;tances. The brigade in this town is ordered to hold it&s;elf in readine&s;s.</P>
<P>If the convention troops &s;hould be their object, it is prob|able the attempt will be too late to an&s;wer any purpo&s;e: the rear divi&s;ion was to cro&s;s the North-river on Wedne&s;|day la&s;t, but mu&s;t certainly have done it on Thur&s;day; the front mu&s;t be not far from the Delaware; and the whole too far advanced to be &s;ubject to a re&s;cue. Added to this, there is a pretty &s;trong guard with each divi&s;ion. His excellency however has &s;ent on the intelligence to colonel Bland who directs their march, urging him to ha&s;ten them forward with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch.</P>
<P>One brigade of Connecticut troops was at Danbury, the other at Frederic&s;burg, when we came away; and general Poor's was in full march for the former, and mu&s;t long &s;ince have arrived.</P>
<CLOSER>I have the honour to be, &amp;c. <SIGNED>R. H. HARRISON.</SIGNED>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour of receiving yours of the &s;econd at this place. I have forwarded the brevet to captain Si|monet; and &s;hall take &s;uch mea&s;ures in regard to colonel Fleury's letter as &s;hall &s;eem proper, upon my arrival at Middlebrook for which I &s;et out again to-morrow.</P>
<P>Upon leaving Elizabethtown I directed colonel Harri|&s;on to inform you of the intelligence I had received, and which I thought demanded my per&s;onal attention, as the enemy appeared to be going up the river in con&s;iderable force. Having put the troops de&s;tined for the Middlebrook cantonment upon their march back towards the North-riv|er, I was proceeding that way my&s;elf when an expre&s;s met me a few miles beyond this, informing me that the enemy's &s;hipping, which had been as high as King's ferry, had fall|en down again. They landed a party at the ferry, and &s;et fire to a few &s;mall buildings near the water; but, upon a party of ours advancing, they immediately [<HI>re-embarked</HI>] without attempting any thing further. The boats and &s;tores of every kind had been previou&s;ly &s;ecured. I cannot ac|count
<PB N="352" REF="029737_0690_0FE29E0A200BBC40">
for this manoeuvre but by &s;uppo&s;ing that they had been mi&s;-informed as to the quantity of &s;tores at the ferry, or that they expected to find the po&s;ts in a defencele&s;s &s;ituation; or it may perhaps have been to favour a forage below.</P>
<P>Finding that the troops de&s;tined for the defence of the Highlands had arrived at their re&s;pective po&s;ts agreeably to my orders and expectations, I have again put tho&s;e in|tended for Middlebrook into motion; and I hope they will arrive there while the roads and weather are both fine.</P>
<P>Accounts from New-York through a good channel in|form me that thirty thou&s;and tons of &s;hipping had been &s;uddenly taken up for government &s;ervice, and that a gen|eral embargo is laid. The occa&s;ion has not yet tran&s;pired; at lea&s;t it has not yet reached me.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has not been in my power to return an an&s;wer to your favour of the &s;ixth in&s;tant till now. The letter met me on the road, &s;eparated from my papers; and I did not reach this place till late on the eleventh, &s;ince which I have been much employed in attending to the di&s;po&s;itions for hutting the army; but in the mean time the objects of the di&s;patch have engaged my utmo&s;t attention.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="029737_0691_0FE29E1997D885D0">
The earne&s;t de&s;ire I have to pay the &s;tricte&s;t compliance in every in&s;tance with the views and in&s;tructions of Con|gre&s;s cannot but make me feel the greate&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s when I find my&s;elf in circum&s;tances of he&s;itation or doubt with re&s;pect to their directions. But the perfect confidence I have in the ju&s;tice and candour of that honourable body emboldens me to communicate without re&s;erve the difficul|ties which occur in the execution of their pre&s;ent order; and the indulgence I have experienced on every former occa&s;ion induces me to imagine that the liberty I now take will not meet with their di&s;approbation.</P>
<P>I have attentively taken up the report of the committee of the fifth (approved by Congre&s;s) on the &s;ubject of my letter of the eleventh ultimo on the propo&s;ed expedition into Canada: I have con&s;idered it in &s;everal lights, and &s;incerely regret that I &s;hould feel my&s;elf under any embar|ra&s;&s;ment in carrying it into execution: Still I remain of opinion, from a general review of things and the &s;tate of our re&s;ources, that no exten&s;ive &s;y&s;tem of co-operation with the French, for the complete emancipation of Cana|da, can be po&s;itively decided on for the en&s;uing year. To propo&s;e a plan of perfect co-operation with a foreign pow|er without a moral certainty in our &s;upplies, and to have that plan actually ratified with the court of Ver&s;ailles, might be attended, in ca&s;e of failure in the conditions on our part, with very fatal effects.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould &s;eem unwilling to tran&s;mit the plan as pre|pared by Congre&s;s, with my ob&s;ervations, it is becau&s;e I find my&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity (in order to give our mini&s;ter &s;ufficient ground to found an application on) to propo&s;e &s;omething more than a vague and indeci&s;ive plan, which, even in the event of a total evacuation of the&s;e States by the enemy, may be rendered impracticable in the execution by a variety of in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacles: or if I retain my pre&s;ent &s;entiments and act con&s;i&s;tently, I mu&s;t point out the difficulties as they appear to me; which mu&s;t embar|ra&s;s his negociations, and may di&s;appoint the views of Con|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>But, proceeding on the idea of the enemy's leaving the&s;e States before the active part of the en&s;uing campaign, I &s;hould fear to hazard a mi&s;take as to the preci&s;e aim and extent of the views of Congre&s;s. The line of conduct
<PB N="354" REF="029737_0692_0FE29E0BA2F612C0">
that I am to ob&s;erve in writing to our mini&s;ter at the cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of France does not appear &s;ufficiently delineated:&mdash;were I to undertake it, I &s;hould be much afraid of erring through mi&s;conception. In this dilemma I would e&s;teem it a par|ticular favour to be excu&s;ed from writing at all on the &s;ub|ject, e&s;pecially as it is the part of candour in me to ac|knowledge that I do not &s;ee my way clear enough to point out &s;uch a plan for co-operation as I conceive to be con|&s;i&s;tent with the ideas of Congre&s;s, and that will be &s;uffi|ciently explanatory with re&s;pect to time and circum&s;tances, to give efficacy to the mea&s;ure. But if Congre&s;s &s;till think it nece&s;&s;ary for me to proceed in the bu&s;ine&s;s, I mu&s;t re|que&s;t their more definitive and explicit in&s;tructions, and that they will permit me, previous to tran&s;mitting the in|tended di&s;patches, to &s;ubmit them to their determination.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h to lay before Congre&s;s more minutely the &s;tate of the army, the condition of our &s;upplies, and the requi&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s nece&s;&s;ary for carrying into execution an under|taking that may involve the mo&s;t &s;erious events. If Con|gre&s;s think this can be done more &s;atisfactorily in a per&s;onal conference, I hope to have the army in &s;uch a &s;ituation before I can receive their an&s;wer, as to afford me an op|portunity of giving my attendance. I would only add that I &s;hall cheerfully comply with the directions of Con|gre&s;s relative to making every preparation in our power for an expedition again&s;t Niagara, and for &s;uch further opera|tions to the northward as time and circum&s;tances &s;hall en|able us to carry on. Mea&s;ures for the purpo&s;e have been taken in part for &s;ome time pa&s;t; and I &s;hall pur&s;ue them vigorou&s;ly. The &s;ubject has long engaged my contempla|tion; and I am thoroughly convinced of the expediency and policy of doing every thing practicable on our part, for giving &s;ecurity to our frontiers by the reduction of tho&s;e places which facilitate annoying them, and even for ac|compli&s;hing the annexation of Canada to the Union.</P>

<P>IN a letter which I had the honour of receiving from Congre&s;s, dated the &s;econd in&s;tant, was inclo&s;ed the copy of one from lieutenant-colonel Fleury, upon the &s;ubject of which, the pre&s;ident de&s;ired me to expre&s;s "my &s;entiments, as al&s;o of the merits of Mr. Fleury during his &s;ervices in the army."</P>
<P>I do not conceive that Congre&s;s &s;hould reque&s;t a renew|al of colonel Fleury's furlough from the French mini&s;ter plenipotentiary. An application of that kind ought, in my opinion, to be made by him&s;elf, not only becau&s;e it is cu&s;|tomary, but becau&s;e &s;olicitations of a &s;imilar nature would in all probability be made by many not having Mr. F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|ry's claim to the favour of the public, and to whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> would be difficult to give a refu&s;al after a precedent had been e&s;tabli&s;hed. I would not be under&s;tood to include the ca&s;e of general Du Portail and the gentlemen in the engineering department, who are peculiarly circum&s;tanced, and in who&s;e behalf I have written particularly to Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Fleury's merits as an officer, I can only re|peat what I have upon &s;everal occa&s;ions mentioned to Con|gre&s;s before,&mdash;that he is brave, active, and intelligent, and that, &s;hould he obtain leave to remain in America, I &s;hall take an opportunity (agreeably to my promi&s;e to him) of employing him in a manner &s;uitable to his rank, and in &s;uch a way as will not cla&s;h with the officers of the line.</P>

<P>I HAD the honour of addre&s;&s;ing Congre&s;s &s;ome time &s;ince on the &s;ubject of general Du Portail and the gentle|men with him. He informs me that his affair has not yet been decided, and is extremely anxious that it &s;hould be in &s;ome way or other. He a&s;&s;igns many powerful rea&s;ons to &s;hew that it is very intere&s;ting to him (if he is not to continue in our &s;ervice) to return to France as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible. He al&s;o informs me that he has rea&s;on to think, in the con&s;ideration of his affair, the retaining him in &s;ervice and the adopting the plan propo&s;ed in his memoir are unit|ed, and the deci&s;ion of the one &s;u&s;pended on that of the other; and has therefore reque&s;ted me to repre&s;ent to Con|gre&s;s that he &s;hould be happy if they could be con&s;idered &s;eparately; and if his &s;ervices, ab&s;tractedly from the project propo&s;ed by him, are deemed nece&s;&s;ary, it will be agreea|ble to him to remain in the country.</P>
<P>I have already taken the liberty to offer my &s;entiments on the propriety of engaging the&s;e gentlemen to continue in the &s;ervice. It really appears to me that they will be e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to our future operations, whether de|fen&s;ive or offen&s;ive; and it cannot therefore but give me plea&s;ure if it &s;hall be con&s;i&s;tent with the views of Congre&s;s to retain them, and to give every encouragement which they may rea&s;onably expect.</P>
