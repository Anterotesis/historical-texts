<Q><BIBL><HI>1 EPISTLE JOHN, III CHAP. 17th VERSE.</HI></BIBL>
<P>But who&s;o hath this world's good, and &s;eeth his brother have need, and &s;hutteth up his bowels of compa&s;&s;ion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of the Go&s;pel, that it gives clear, and con&s;i&s;tent views of the perfections, and government of God: that it re|veals a &s;y&s;tem of doctrines incomparably &s;ublime, perfectly pure, and with infinite wi&s;dom adapted to the circum&s;tances of man: that, it enjoins duties per|fectly rea&s;onable; as they re&s;ult, not &s;olely in the &s;overeign will of the Supreme; but nece&s;&s;arily orig|inate in the infinite perfection of his nature, and the particular &s;tanding of man, as a rational, dependent, &s;ocial being; and tend to exalt his nature; to ren|der him u&s;eful, and happy; as an individual, a mem|ber of a particular &s;ociety, a citizen of the world, and a probationer for immortality.</P>
<P>Among many of tho&s;e excellent, and intere&s;ting doctrines of chri&s;tianity, that, in our text is one, of eminent rank: and that is, the importance of chri&s;t|ian charity, or benevolence.</P>
<P>This, the Apo&s;tle con&s;iders &s;o e&s;&s;ential a part of the chri&s;tian temper, that without it, no man can
<PB N="6" REF="030653_0006_0FE84F1E29BA4BF8">
exi&s;t a friend to God, or be &s;uppo&s;ed to exerci&s;e love to the great Author of good.</P>
<P>"Who&s;o hath this world's good, and &s;eeth his brother have need, and &s;hutteth up his bowels of compa&s;&s;ion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?"</P>
<P>This interrogation involves a &s;trong negation. A man who cannot cordially &s;ympathize with the afflict|ed, and contribute a proportion of his time, intere&s;t and talents, to a &s;upply of the indigent, and relief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, is a &s;tranger to that religion, the e&s;&s;ence of which is love: neither has he experienced the power of the Go&s;pel, which breathes benevolence.</P>
<P>The frequency, and per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence by which a generous charity and tender &s;ympathy are incul|cated in the Go&s;pel, evince the importance of tho&s;e chri&s;tian virtues, and &s;uppo&s;e an occa&s;ion for a con|tinual exerci&s;e of the noble temper.</P>
<P>We find the face of the moral world equally vari|egated, in re&s;pect to the outward circum&s;tances, and local &s;ituation of its numerous members, as the &s;ur|face of the globe on which we tread.</P>
<P>We &s;ee &s;ome in pro&s;perity; others in adver&s;ity; &s;ome in affluence, others in a &s;tate of indigence.</P>
<P>We have high and low, rich and poor, bond and free. This always has been, and ever will be the &s;tate of the world in degree, to the conclu&s;ion of time.</P>
<P>The effect being uniform, and univer&s;al, demon|&s;trates a permanent cau&s;e; which can be no le&s;s, than the unalterable e&s;tabli&s;hment of heaven.</P>
<P>Affluence and indigence, pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity, are by no means the re&s;ult of blind chance, or con|tingent

fate; although, in all tho&s;e in&s;tances, there is the concurring influence of natural cau&s;es; &s;ome of which operate in a mea&s;ure, &s;ubordinately to hu|man controul: Yet, in general terms, rea&s;on and revelation teach us to adore, the &s;overeign Provi|dence of God, as the &s;upreme di&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration urges a perfect approbation of the pre&s;ent adju&s;tment of the &s;cale; renders profound &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion indi&s;pen&s;ible; and opens a way to the ex|erci&s;e of tho&s;e bowels of compa&s;&s;ion in&s;i&s;ted on in my text, as e&s;&s;ential to the chri&s;tian character.</P>
<P>The principal intention of my di&s;cour&s;e will be&mdash;</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place&mdash;more particularly to illu&s;trate the agency of Providence, in the diver&s;e circum|&s;tances of mankind, and to point out the wi&s;dom of &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>And then&mdash;to explain the nature, point out the ob|ligation, and importance of that charity, and com|pa&s;&s;ion, implicitly urged in our text.</P>
<P>This &s;acred pa&s;&s;age &s;uppo&s;es, that objects of com|pa&s;&s;ion will be continually pre&s;enting to view, in this changing world. "Who&s;o &s;eeth his brother have need." And &s;aid our Lord, "The poor ye have always with you." This declaration is the re&s;ult, not of omni&s;cience merely; but, of a ju&s;t view of the e&s;tabli&s;hments of nature, and an experimental ac|quaintance with human vici&s;&s;itudes.</P>
<P>In the&s;e unfailing &s;ources our Lord fore&s;aw, that poverty and pain, wretchedne&s;s and wo, would uni|formly originate.</P>
<P>Ob&s;ervation and experience, have invariably evinc|ed the truths of the prediction.</P>
<P>It is a doctrine of revelation, that the diver&s;e cir|cum&s;tances of men are ordered by Providence.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="030653_0008_0FE84F2465945C80">Says Solomon&mdash;"The rich and the poor meet to|gether; the Lord is the maker of them all."</P>
<P>In contemplating the agency of Providence how|ever, in the production of any event, we &s;hould re|member, that there is the concurring influence of &s;econd cau&s;es.</P>
<P>In a common cour&s;e, temperance produces health. Indu&s;try and oeconomy procure riches; and the con|trary vices, are attended with poverty and wretch|edne&s;s. This is the e&s;tabli&s;hment of heaven. But &s;till, the&s;e cau&s;es do not invariably produce their &s;everal effects.</P>
<P>Schemes projected with wi&s;dom, and pro&s;ecuted with diligence, are not always crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. Providence defeats our de&s;igns, and bla&s;ts our faire&s;t pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>On the contrary, mea&s;ures adopted with the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree of policy, and pur&s;ued with a carele&s;s indifference, which forbids the mo&s;t di&s;tant probabil|ity of &s;ucce&s;s, are &s;urpri&s;ingly efficacious.</P>
<P>Thus, riches are &s;ometimes procured, by cau&s;es apparently inadequate to the effect; and poverty &s;uc|ceeds the mo&s;t wi&s;ely concerted mea&s;ures for avoid|ance. In in&s;tances thus e&s;pecially remarkable the agency of Providence is peculiarly &s;triking. They abundantly verify that memorable a&s;&s;ertion of Solo|mon's, "The race is not to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong, nor yet favour to men of &s;kill;" but &s;uch circum&s;tances attend them, as an infinitely wi&s;e Providence plea&s;es to appoint.</P>
<P>It is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, that a man of temperance &s;uffers the painful effects of a &s;ickly habit, and clo&s;es the &s;cene by an untimely death; while the licen|tious epicure takes his ca&s;e, and retains a firmne&s;s of
<PB N="9" REF="030653_0009_0FE84F306FCF5588">
body to the evening of life. Thus, "they that pro|voke God are &s;ecure; into who&s;e hand God bring|eth abundantly." Who knoweth not, that the hand of God is in all the&s;e things?" Rea&s;on a&s;&s;ents, that there is an invi&s;ible hand, which controuls &s;econd cau&s;es with &s;overeign wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Although all the mi&s;ery &s;uffered in this world of trial, may be con&s;idered as the effect of human folly, in a &s;econdary view; yet, we are pointed to Provi|dence, as the wi&s;ely controuling cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Human policy and power are as perfectly unable to effect a compleat equality in the circum&s;tances, and means of enjoyment, in re&s;pect to the moral world, as they are to reduce the globe to a plane. The unalterable laws of nature forbid the attempt.</P>
<P>The widely different circum&s;tances of men, as well as their diver&s;e local &s;ituations evince, that the rich, and the poor, the comfortable liver, and the perfectly indigent, are &s;cattered through &s;ociety, by a &s;overeign Providence.</P>
<P>Such is the territorial lot of &s;ome, that, indefati|gable indu&s;try, and rigid oeconomy, can promi&s;e nothing higher, than a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; even if Pro|vidence &s;hould &s;ecure them from uncommon di&s;a&s;ters.</P>
<P>A &s;eemingly trifling di&s;a&s;ter, immediately throws them upon the charity of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to others, whatever may be their local &s;ituation, although they are &s;tationed in a place, where a luxuriant &s;oil, and advantageous commerce, render an affluent living of the ea&s;ie&s;t attainment po&s;&s;ible; for want of a capacity to improve, or &s;o much as en|joy the bounties of nature, they pine, and even &s;tarve in the mid&s;t of plenty.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="030653_0010_0FE84F335AB78DC8">Such is the &s;tate of the world; of cour&s;e, we mu&s;t expect objects of charity continually pre&s;enting to view.</P>
<P>In this, apparently, unequal adju&s;tment of the &s;cale, we may di&s;cover obvious marks of wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the con&s;truction of the natural world, the &s;u|preme Architect has ordained variety; which is ju&s;tly deemed the beauty of creation.</P>
<P>There are bodies cele&s;tial, and bodies terre&s;trial. Of each of tho&s;e &s;pecies of bodies there is an al|mo&s;t infinite variety. One excels another in point of lu&s;tre, and importance. Says the Apo&s;tle, "One &s;tar differeth from another &s;tar in glory." There is one glory of the &s;un; another glory of the moon; and another glory of the &s;tars."</P>
<P>We behold a &s;un, and a glow worm; a &s;tar of the fir&s;t magnitude, and a fleeting meteor; a pearl, and a pebble.</P>
<P>To view &s;uch a wi&s;ely contrived variety, &s;uch re|gular gradations, and &s;triking contra&s;ts in the natu|ral world, is peculiarly plea&s;ing to a contemplative mind, and gives exalted views of the un&s;earchable wi&s;dom of the adorable Creator.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar arrangement, as it re&s;pects certain pur|po&s;es, may be deemed a di&s;play of wi&s;dom in the moral world. Different capacities, diver&s;e local &s;ituations, various degrees of property and power, rea&s;on and experience atte&s;t are e&s;&s;ential, to the order and happine&s;s of the univer&s;al whole.</P>
<P>Various ranks of intelligencies exi&s;t in the heavenly world, where there is the brighte&s;t po&s;&s;ible di&s;play of the wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s of the Creator, and Ruler of all.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="030653_0011_0FE84F3805ACC240">But, in re&s;pect to objects of real mi&s;ery, whom we behold in the world, equally de&s;erving of ea&s;e, with others who &s;wim in plea&s;ure; our feelings are recon|ciled to the painful pro&s;pect, by a con&s;ideration, of the immutable rectitude of the &s;upreme Di&s;po&s;er of events; and by a firm belief, that, the pre&s;ent is only a &s;tate of trial, preparatory to a better; in which the my&s;teries of Providence will be unfolded to the view of admiring worlds.</P>
<P>We may further ob&s;erve&mdash;that, a view of poverty and di&s;tre&s;s &s;erves to enkindle grateful &s;entiments in tho&s;e, who are in ea&s;e and affluence; to awaken their bowels of compa&s;&s;ion, and call into exerci&s;e that cha|rity and benevolence which chri&s;tianity in&s;pires, and inculcates upon all, as ornamental to a chri&s;tian, and well plea&s;ing to God.</P>
<P>Agreeably to the order of my di&s;cour&s;e, I will now attempt an illu&s;tration of the nature, obligation and importance of this chri&s;tian virtue urged in our text.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle u&s;es neither of the terms, love, charity or benevolence, but compa&s;&s;ion; this is the &s;ame virtue, under a different form, &s;uited to the particu|lar ca&s;e which calls forth its exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Benevolence, charity, candour, a forgiving temper, and &s;ympathetic compa&s;&s;ion, are all compri&s;ed in the term love; and are nothing more, than this one comprehen&s;ive principle, appearing in different forms, and adju&s;ted to different circum&s;tances, per&s;ons, and things.</P>
<P>Love, when denoting general good will, is termed benevolence. When it involves delight in any par|ticular object, and a de&s;ire for connection with it, on account of its apparent merit, or intrin&s;ic excellence, it is complacence.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="030653_0012_0FE84F399211D2F0">When importing a di&s;po&s;ition to a mo&s;t favourable con&s;truction of the words and actions of others, it is candour. When it intends an inclination, or ac|tually generous contribution to the relief of the nece&s;|&s;itous, it is beneficence. When manife&s;ting it&s;elf in a tender &s;ympathy with objects in mi&s;ery, and &s;olici|tude for their relief, it is compa&s;&s;ion. In this view of the heaven-born principle, the Apo&s;tle, in our text, terms it, bowels of compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In my pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall not confine my&s;elf to this particular form of love, as di&s;playing it&s;elf, only in a tender feeling for objects in mi&s;ery; but &s;hall allow my&s;elf the latitude pre&s;cribed above.</P>
<P>It is of importance, carefully to ob&s;erve&mdash;that, love, charity, or compa&s;&s;ion, may be con&s;idered in two different points of view; either as a natural in&s;tinc|tive principle, or as a chri&s;tian virtue.</P>
<P>By in&s;tinct is here intended, a propen&s;ion in the creature, to certain actions adapted to his nature, without a &s;en&s;e of duty upon his mind, or regard to the honor and authority of God. This in&s;tinctive principle of charity, or benevolence, however deficient as to motive, or end, when viewed in the light of chri&s;tianity, has its u&s;e, and is of &s;ingular import|ance in &s;ociety. Without it, man would cea&s;e to be a &s;ocial being.</P>
<P>The great Author of nature has interwoven this principle in the human con&s;titution, for wi&s;e rea&s;ons, and will overrule it to purpo&s;es of pre&s;ent impor|tance; although, he will not finally crown it with immortality.</P>
<P>Of a much higher nature, and more noble com|plexion, is that benevolent compa&s;&s;ion urged in our text, by an Apo&s;tle divinely in&s;pired.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030653_0013_0FE84F43A3E2B0F8">In this &s;acred pa&s;&s;age, as well as in other parts of the Go&s;pel, it is con&s;idered as a chri&s;tian virtue; originating in a &s;en&s;e of duty to God, and re&s;pect to his honour; and tending in its exerci&s;es e&s;pecially towards his children; for this important rea&s;on; becau&s;e, they bear his image, and are members of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle, with a freedom, and boldne&s;s becom|ing an emba&s;&s;ador of Chri&s;t, declares the mo&s;t pom|pous &s;ervices performed upon any principle inferior to the above, or the mo&s;t painful and expen&s;ive ob|lations to &s;ociety, de&s;titute of the e&s;&s;ential nature of a chri&s;tian duty, and of cour&s;e a nullity, in the view of the all-perfect Judge.</P>
<P>"Though I &s;peak with the tongues of men and Angels, and have not charity, I am become as &s;ound|ing bra&s;s, or as a tinkling cymbal." "And though I have the gift of prophecy, and under&s;tand all my&s;|teries, and have not charity, I am nothing." "And though I be&s;tow all my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to be burned, and have not charity, I am nothing."</P>
<P>By charity, here, is intended evangelical love; as appears from the following pa&s;&s;age&mdash;"Now abideth faith, hope, charity; the&s;e force; but the greate&s;t of the&s;e is charity." True love is the grace which bears this di&s;tingui&s;hing rank; becau&s;e, it renders the &s;ub|ject more like God; and will be a predominant prin|ciple in the heavenly world, to an interminable eter|nity; while, faith and hope, are &s;wallowed up, in vi&s;ion and enjoyment.</P>
<P>This charity is to be exerci&s;ed e&s;pecially, towards the children of God; who, in the Go&s;pel are &s;tiled brethren. The Go&s;pel in our text &s;peaks of with|holding charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance from a brother, in par|ticular, as an evidence of the ab&s;ence of a chri&s;tian temper.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="030653_0014_0FE84F4CA748F220">Paul exhorts the Galatian converts to do good unto all men; e&s;pecially to the hou&s;ehold of faith.</P>
<P>True chri&s;tians are the excellent of the earth, as they bear the image of God; are faithful in the cau&s;e of God, and zealous advocates for the be&s;t intere&s;t of men.</P>
<P>Individuals, or a &s;ociety of this happy character, are with the highe&s;t rea&s;on propo&s;ed, as primary ob|jects of our tendere&s;t affections, and complacential regards.</P>
<P>But, we are not confined to the chri&s;tian family, in our benevolent wi&s;hes. Particular &s;ocieties with which we are connected, by &s;ome peculiar bonds, have a right to a &s;pecial &s;hare of our attention, and friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Tho&s;e, to whom we are allied by con&s;anguinity, rea&s;on and chri&s;tianity point to our view, as objects of particular regard.</P>
<P>Partial connections are nece&s;&s;ary, in the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate. The great family cannot &s;it in the &s;ame circle; but is unavoidably formed into detach|ed parts; each &s;elect portion can be&s;t attend to their own improvement; each member can be&s;t know the wants of his own body, and &s;upply them; can feel their burdens, and admini&s;ter to their &s;upport under them, or relief from them. The wants of the great whole cannot fall under particular ob&s;ervation; nei|ther can there be a mutual conver&s;e through &s;o ex|ten&s;ive a body.</P>
<P>Particular &s;ocieties therefore, for the purpo&s;es of cultivating the &s;ocial affections, diffu&s;ing knowledge, and promoting the happine&s;s of a &s;elect few, are founded in rea&s;on, expedience, and even nece&s;&s;ity. At the &s;ame time, a love of benevolence is due to be|ing in general. "Let us do good unto all men." is an injunction of chri&s;tianity. Equally exten&s;ive is that compa&s;&s;ion urged in our text.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="030653_0015_0FE84F529E9EE9B8">It involves no le&s;s, than good will to all; a tender regard to the be&s;t intere&s;t of mankind, and cheerful exertions to promote the happine&s;s of all within the &s;phere of our influence. It imparts a real participation of the joys and &s;orrows of our fel|low men; that we pity the afflicted, and endeavour to relieve them; that we are concerned for the erro|neous, and wi&s;h to reclaim them: that we feel for the indigent, and cheerfully contribute a rea&s;onable &s;upply; that we are placable to our enemies, and ready for reconciliation; that we can forget per&s;onal injuries, and forgive them: In a word&mdash;it involves a di&s;po&s;ition to communicate happine&s;s in a way which rea&s;on approves, and upon motives which chri&s;tianity urges, and in&s;pires.</P>
<P>Thus exten&s;ive, and &s;ublime, is that chri&s;tian com|pa&s;&s;ion recommended in our text.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations open a way to an illu&s;tration of its obligation, and importance.</P>
<P>To exerci&s;e this heavenly temper, renders a man as near a re&s;emblance of God, as humanity will admit. "God is love; and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him."</P>
<P>By this mo&s;t forcible argument, chri&s;tian charity is urged by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, upon his dear di&s;ciples. "I &s;ay unto you, love your enemies; ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you; that ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven; for he maketh his &s;un to ri&s;e, on the evil, and on the good."</P>
<P>Thus by exerci&s;ing a diffu&s;ive benevolence, to|wards the unworthy, and a love of complacence to the truly amiable, we imitate God, and give the brighte&s;t po&s;&s;ible di&s;play of an heavenly temper. In this view, chri&s;tians are exhorted to be perfect, as their Father in heaven is perfect.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="030653_0016_0FE84F06CA44FF70">The repeated injunctions of &s;acred &s;cripture, fur|ther, render the cultivation, and exerci&s;e of this chri&s;|tian virtue indi&s;pen&s;ibly binding.</P>
<P>Even, under the comparatively dark, and partial di&s;pen&s;ation of the law, humanity and compa&s;&s;ion were as repeatedly urged, and cogently enforced, as any of the direct duties of devotion. Yea, under both di&s;pen&s;ations, po&s;itive and ritual duties, are held in &s;ubordination to tho&s;e, of the moral and &s;ocial kind. Said God in reference to the ritual &s;ervices of his people of old&mdash;"bring no more vain oblations; learn to do well; &s;eek judgment; relieve the oppre&s;&s;|ed; judge the fatherle&s;s; plead for the widow." Similar to this, is that reply made by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, to the cavilling Phari&s;ees&mdash;"Go ye, and learn what that meaneth; I will have mercy, and not &s;a|crifice." And the apo&s;tle Peter exhorts chri&s;tians to love as brethren.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;ublime virtue is urged upon the Colo&s;|&s;ian converts, with the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence. "Put on therefore, as the elect of God holy, and be|loved, bowels of mercies, kindne&s;s, humblene&s;s of mind, meekne&s;s, long-&s;uffering, forbearing one ano|ther, and forgiving one another.</P>
<P>Of &s;o eminent a rank is this virtue in our text, that it is con&s;idered as e&s;&s;ential to the chri&s;tian cha|racter. The man who is de&s;titute of bowels of com|pa&s;&s;ion for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, is a &s;tranger to religion, an enemy to God.</P>
<P>Equally important, and indi&s;pen&s;ible, does this virtue appear, from that relation, and mutual depen|dence &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, between the numerous members of the great family of man.</P>
<P>If we confine our views to chri&s;tians, they are of the &s;ame nature, in a &s;piritual view, born from above;
<PB N="17" REF="030653_0017_0FE84F5B88EBA548">
begotten to the &s;ame lively hope; have one common Lord; are engaged in one cau&s;e, and are all tending to the &s;ame glorious end. Unity and love, and the tendere&s;t affection, ought of cour&s;e, to pervade the whole body.</P>
<P>A relation in a natural, and civil re&s;pect, between the numerous members of the human race, calls for the exerci&s;e of the &s;ame virtue throughout the whole.</P>
<P>However diver&s;e the complexion, capacities, tem|pers, intere&s;t, and manners of men, they are all de&s;|cended from one common progenitor; and of cour&s;e have the &s;ame nature. Says the great Apo&s;tle&mdash; "God hath made of one blood, all fle&s;h to dwell on the earth." To love as brethren then, is a duty re|&s;ulting from the con&s;titution of nature.</P>
<P>We may further con&s;ider&mdash;that throughout the whole human family, there is a &s;imilarity of pa&s;&s;ions, of weakne&s;s and infirmity: The &s;ame real dangers, and imaginary evils; the &s;ame natural foibles, and moral depravity: which con&s;titution nece&s;&s;itates a mutual interchange of charitable offices, bowels of compa&s;&s;ion, friendly forbearance, candid allowances, and favourable con&s;tructions.</P>
<P>The cultivation, and exerci&s;e of this chri&s;tian &s;pirit, lay the only permanent ba&s;is of civil peace, and &s;ocial happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Sordid pa&s;&s;ions are the baneful &s;ource of anarchy, and war, and of all that wretchedn&s;es and wo, which are the unhappy lot of mortality.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t place, I ob&s;erve&mdash;that the refined plea|&s;ures re&s;ulting from the &s;ublime affection, which chri&s;tianity inculcates, and in&s;pires, further evince their importance, and afford a per&s;ua&s;ive argument to the cultivation, and exerci&s;e of them.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="030653_0018_0FE84F5D2997DF78">Unruly pa&s;&s;ions create a painful ferment in the mind, which renders a man like a troubled &s;ea, who&s;e waters ca&s;t up mire and dirt.</P>
<P>But the chri&s;tian virtues in&s;pire a &s;olid peace; a peace, re&s;ulting from con&s;cious conformity to princi|ples of rea&s;on and religion, and a con&s;equent pro&s;|pect of immortality.</P>
<P>Thus, amiable, exten&s;ively u&s;eful, and highly im|portant, are tho&s;e &s;ocial virtues recommended in the Go&s;pel; a comprehen&s;ive branch of which is involv|ed in that tender compa&s;&s;ion, urged in our text.</P>
<P>The man, who lives in the exerci&s;e of this chri&s;|tian love, and compa&s;&s;ion, is a favourite of heaven, and the be&s;t friend to man. A contrary character, is an enemy to God, to him&s;elf, to his country, and the world.</P>
<P>Are chri&s;tian charity, diffu&s;ive benevolence, and bowels of compa&s;&s;ion, of &s;o amiable a nature, and &s;ingular importance? every good man wi&s;hes to &s;ee them promoted in every po&s;&s;ible way; and will ap|prove of any in&s;titution, human, or divine, which he is convinced is adapted to the laudable de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Upon this principle, the religion of the Go&s;pel is cordially embraced, and its in&s;titutions revered, by the really wi&s;e and truly good.</P>
<P>For a &s;imilar rea&s;on, principles of Ma&s;onry, &s;o far as I have been able to collect information, from au|thentic documents, merit approbation. For they in|volve the moral, and &s;ocial virtues, &s;o clearly explain|ed, and cogently enforced in the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I find that a Ma&s;on is &s;acredly bound, to an uniform ob&s;ervation of the &s;ame duties to God, him&s;elf, his neighbour, and to man, which the religion of na|ture
<PB N="19" REF="030653_0019_0FE84F643AC0E0D8">
and revelation unitedly enforce. He is bound "to fear God, love the brotherhood, and honour all men." In re&s;pect to God, he is required "to look to him, as the chief good;" and "to &s;peak of his name, with reverence, and awe." In regard to his neighbour, he is obliged "to act upon the &s;quare;" (i. e.) "to do to others, as he would that others &s;hould do to him." Relative to him&s;elf, <Q>a Ma&s;on is bound to avoid every &s;pecies of irregularity, and intem|perance, unbecoming the dignity of human nature.</Q> E&s;pecially is he obliged, "to practice benevolence, and charity."</P>
<P>The&s;e I conceive, to be &s;ome of the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;ticks of this ancient, and honourable in|&s;titution.</P>
<P>Its antiquity is indi&s;putable. That, it de&s;erves the appellation of honourable, an appeal to its principles as above, may evince.</P>
<P>To the honour of the in&s;titution, it may be further ob&s;erved&mdash;that, &s;ome of the mo&s;t dignified charac|ters, patrons of &s;cience, friends to their country, and to man, have graced the Fraternity, by joining their number, and &s;ubmiting to their di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>We may add&mdash;in honour to the Society, that, the numerous ages, through which it has exi&s;ted, have not been able to produce any higher charges again&s;t it, than may with equal propriety, be alledged agnin&s;t any other order of defectible creatures.</P>
<P>In no in&s;tance, perhaps, has the In&s;titution been proved an ob&s;truction, to civil, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, or &s;o|cial happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I will hazard a pre&s;umption, that, many of the great human family have experienced its beneficial effects.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="030653_0020_0FE84F65CE7504F0">Are not the&s;e rea&s;ons &s;ufficient, if not to induce approbation, yet, to forbid cen&s;ure?</P>
<P>That Ma&s;ons do, in numerous in&s;tances, counter|act their profe&s;&s;ion, and e&s;&s;entially deviate from their excellent principles, like every other Denomination, is undoubtedly true.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, their theory may merit approbation; while their practice de&s;erves cen&s;ure,</P>
<P>Principles are founded in nature, and exi&s;t, inde|pendently of practice.</P>
<P>Were the world to judge of chri&s;tianity by the conduct of its profe&s;&s;ors, they might be ju&s;tified in rejecting it, as, unworthy of God to reveal, and unfit for man to receive.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to chri&s;tianity however, every man has the &s;y&s;tem before him; that, he may judge of its merits, independently of the practice of its profe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>But, Ma&s;onry, is mo&s;tly a &s;ecret to the world. But few have any knowledge of its principles; &s;o, that the multitude are obliged to found their &s;entiments of its theory, upon the deportment of the Fraternity.</P>
<P>This, ought to &s;erve, as a powerful motive, with every ma&s;onic &s;ociety, to an uniform exhibition, of tho&s;e moral, &s;ocial, and chri&s;tian virtues, which are the ornament of human nature, and will infallibly &s;ecure publick approbation, and private e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Peculiarly important is it, that, this argument &s;hould have a practical influence, upon the newly con&s;tituted Lodge in this Town. For it is now in its infancy; and is here, a novelty.</P>
<P>Various opinions are formed re&s;pecting it. Some &s;uppo&s;e it to be of an evil tendency: others may
<PB N="21" REF="030653_0021_0FE84F6CF3C0A458">
think it of no u&s;e to &s;ociety; and &s;ome con&s;ider it a matter of indifference.</P>
<P>Which of the&s;e conjectures are founded in truth, your conduct, Gentlemen, will decide.</P>
<P>Let the &s;olemn charges in your book of con&s;titu|tions be ob&s;erved, and the principles of the Order re|duced to practice; &s;ure I am, that you may &s;hine, as the ornaments of civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>In the language of an in&s;pired Apo&s;tle let me ex|hort you&mdash;"to walk circum&s;pectly; not as fools but as wi&s;e."</P>
<P>A &s;en&s;e of duty, and regard to the reputation of the In&s;titution, will induce a cautious in&s;pection of the character of tho&s;e, whom you admit into your Fraternity.</P>
<P>The&s;e motives will likewi&s;e operate to a &s;trict ob|&s;ervation of temperance, &s;obriety, and decorum, in all your a&s;&s;emblies, as well as in your general inter|cour&s;e with the world.</P>
<P>You will not forget to ob&s;erve &s;ea&s;onable hours in your meetings; remembering that family religion is not to be neglected.</P>
<P>The eminently good, in all ages of the world, have con&s;idered this, an important branch of &s;ocial duty; and have not failed to pay a devout regard to its ob|ligation.</P>
<P>To &s;ee its neglect &s;anctioned by a &s;ociety, will not fail to ca&s;t an indelible blot upon their character.</P>
<P>You will allow me to ob&s;erve&mdash;that it will not be altogether unimportant for this, and other detached
<PB N="22" REF="030653_0022_0FE84F6E895CFCE8">
portions of the great Ma&s;onic Fraternity, to caution the young, and le&s;s informed members, again&s;t a fond indulgence, in rapturous encomiums upon the &s;ublime my&s;teries of Ma&s;onry: As if, in that &s;y&s;tem, every &s;cattering ray, leading to a knowledge of truth, were collected to a point.</P>
<P>Such empty &s;ugge&s;tions, a man of rea&s;on and in|formation, ever views with a benevolent contempt.</P>
<P>Finally, my friends&mdash;whatever may be your pro|ficiency in ma&s;onry, keep in view the infinite import|ance of Go&s;pel piety.</P>
<P>Prayerfully &s;tudy, and uniformly practice the art of holy living.</P>
<P>A &s;peculative acquaintance with this heavenly art, may be acquired by human exertion: but, an experi|mental knowledge of things Divine, chri&s;tianity obliges us to con&s;ider the re&s;ult of &s;piritual illumination.</P>
<P>Religion lays the only foundation of pre&s;ent peace, or future felicity. Its e&s;&s;ence con&s;i&s;ts, not, in lifele&s;s &s;peculations, which only enkindle enthu&s;ia&s;tic rap|tures; but, in inward purity and love.</P>
<P>The &s;ublime plea&s;ures, re&s;ulting from this prin|ciple, of heavenly extract, are a profound &s;ecret to the world; a &s;ecret, never taught, but in the &s;chool of Chri&s;t, entru&s;ted to none, but followers of the Lamb.</P>
<P>Said our Lord&mdash;"I am the good &s;hepherd, and know my &s;heep, and am known of mine." The Ev|angeli&s;t informs us&mdash;that "the &s;heep follow Chri&s;t, for they know his voice, but a &s;tranger will they not
<PB N="23" REF="030653_0023_0FE84F758A97AB80">
follow." Here are tokens, by which, a chri&s;tian will find admi&s;&s;ion into the New Jeru&s;alem, the city of the Living God.</P>
<P>The grand token is, the chri&s;tian temper: a pract|ical faith, which triumphs over the world.</P>
<P>To him that overcometh, will I grant to eat of the hidden manna; and I will give him a white &s;tone; and in the &s;tone a new name written, which no man knoweth, &s;aving he that receiveth it.</P>
<P>So be it LORD&mdash;ALLELUIA,</P>
