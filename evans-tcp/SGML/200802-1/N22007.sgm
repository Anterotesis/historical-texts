<HEAD TYPE="sub">Whereas propo&s;als to erect a Bank were publi&s;hed in the Baltimore news-papers as follows, viz: PROPOSALS FOR ESTABLISHING A BANK <HI>IN BALTIMORE,</HI> ON THE CONDITIONS FOLLOWING. Conditions of Subscription.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS, We the &s;ub&s;cribers convinced of the great advantages that would re&s;ult from a Bank which &s;hould embrace the intere&s;ts of the &s;tate, as well as the particular intere&s;t of Stockholders, and who&s;e capital &s;hould be large enough to meet the pre&s;ent and probable future demands of a growing trade, have and do hereby &s;eve|rally agree to e&s;tabli&s;h a BANK in the town of Baltimore, on the following principles, and to take each of us the &s;hares annexed to our names re&s;pectively, upon its being e&s;tabli&s;hed by charter, viz.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t&mdash;That the original capital con&s;i&s;t of Three Millions of Dollars, divided into &s;hares of 300 dollars, and five in|&s;talments of 600,000 dollars each, payable, viz. The fir&s;t in&s;talment in 1796&mdash;the &s;econd in 1799&mdash;the third in 1801&mdash; the fourth in 1803&mdash;the fifth in 1805.</P>
<P>Secondly&mdash;That the original capital be encrea&s;ed to a certain amount by new &s;ub&s;criptions on the original terms, whenever the Bank &s;hall divide upon an average above ten per cent. for five &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years.</P>
<P><PB REF="029010_0003_0FDE8988ED5D5F70">Thirdly&mdash;That the Bank &s;hall pay to the &s;tate one half the annual profits which &s;hall exceed an average of ten per cent. the other half to the Stockholders.</P>
<P>Fourthly&mdash;That the &s;tate may al&s;o be a &s;tockholder to a certain amount, and that provi&s;ion may be made for the union of this Bank with the Bank of Maryland, the two Banks con&s;enting thereto.</P>
<P>We the &s;ub&s;cribers do further agree to petition the Gene|ral A&s;&s;embly, at their next &s;e&s;&s;ion, to grant a charter of in|corporation agreeably to the above propo&s;itions, re&s;erving neverthele&s;s to our&s;elves, and each of us a right to refu&s;e and withhold our &s;ub&s;cription money, &s;hould the charter be ma|terially variant from the &s;aid propo&s;itions, or contain &s;uch matters as we cannot in ju&s;tice to our&s;elves approve.</P>

<P>And whereas &s;ub&s;criptions have been completed agreeably to the afore&s;aid terms and conditions, wherefore, the manag|ers in con&s;equence of the duties a&s;&s;igned them, as afore|&s;aid, and in the name and behalf of the re&s;pective &s;ub&s;cribers, beg leave to lay the &s;ame before the legi&s;lature, and to &s;olicit an act of incorporation, to enable them to carry into effect the laudable object of their a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>The petitioners con&s;idering that the Banks in Baltimore-town, from the &s;mallne&s;s of their capital and other cau&s;es, do not come up to the end for which they were e&s;tabli&s;hed, viewing al&s;o banks with capitals, adequate to the trade of a country, as in&s;truments fitted to excite a greater degree of indu&s;try, to extend commerce, to produce a more favourable balance of trade, obviate u&s;ury, and lower the intere&s;t of money; and, that the&s;e effects have invariably followed in a greater or le&s;s degree their e&s;tabli&s;hment, they could not doubt as to the utility and propriety of combining together to erect a new one in Baltimore, with a capital commen&s;urate to the actual and growing trade of that pro&s;perous town.</P>
<P>The petitioners further con&s;idering, that a Bank of &s;uffi|cient capital, con&s;tituted upon principles likely to en&s;ure to it the continued protection of government, mu&s;t be the means of attracting into the &s;tate con&s;iderable &s;ums of money, to be inve&s;ted in its &s;tock which would not otherwi&s;e or without &s;uch an in&s;titution make any part of its wealth, and con|&s;idering that every &s;um brought into the &s;tate, to purcha&s;e &s;tock, will be &s;o much added to its circulating &s;pecie and its capacity to carry on improvements, they deemed it of con|&s;equence that the Bank in contemplation, &s;hould be &s;o framed as to have a ju&s;t claim to the con&s;tant protection of govern|ment, and the uninterrupted confidence ot the public.</P>
<P>The petitioners con&s;idering moreover, that chartered Banks from their nature mu&s;t be cla&s;&s;ed among <HI>public in&s;titutions</HI> it was deemed proper to give that propo&s;ed, &s;uch an organization as might forever prevent it from becoming an in&s;trument to be wielded at the will of a few individuals, or from &s;inking into

a mere <HI>private e&s;tabli&s;hment.</HI> Having the&s;e objects for their guide, the petitioners have annexed a &s;ketch for an act of in|corporation, with a brief expo&s;ition of its leading principles, in order the more fully to convey their ideas, and that their intentions may not be mi&s;taken or mi&s;repre&s;ented, all which is humbly &s;ubmitted to the wi&s;dom of the Legi&s;lature.</P>

<HEAD>A BRIEF EXPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P>AS preliminary to a particular view of leading principles of the propo&s;ed in&s;titution, it may be proper to &s;ubmit for con&s;ideration&mdash; 1&s;t. Certain <HI>di&s;advantages,</HI> that appear to be in&s;epa|rable from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Bank, who&s;e capital is inadequate to the demands of the trade of the place, where e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. 2d. Certain <HI>advantages</HI> connected with a Bank, who&s;e capital is commen&s;urate to the demands originating in the cour&s;e of a regularly growing trade; and, 3d. To examine certain objections that may be &s;uppo&s;ed to militate again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Bank in contemplation.</P>
<P N="1">I. As to the <HI>di&s;advantages</HI> in&s;eparable from a Bank who&s;e capital is inadequate to the demands of the trade of the place where e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> po&s;&s;ible <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a Bank of &s;mall or contracted <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, to admini&s;ter to the demands of an exten|&s;ive and growing trade, or to i&s;&s;ue its notes to any amount, at plea&s;ure, and keep them in circulation, it would be wholly unnece&s;&s;ary to enlarge its funds, or e&s;tabli&s;h new Banks with capitals more corre&s;|pondent to the circum&s;tances of trade. As this, however, is impo&s;&s;ible, as a Bank of &s;mall capital cannot be made to &s;upply a great and growing de|mand, as the i&s;&s;ues of every Bank is limitted by imperious circum&s;tances; as it is an a&s;certained point in banking, that the amount of notes which can be &s;upported in circulation mu&s;t, generally &s;peaking, be in a certain proportion to the funds of the Bank; it is evident, therefore, that in places
<PB N="9" REF="029010_0008_0FDE8918EAAF3B18">
where the demand reaches beyond this proportion, that new Banks may be erected to &s;upply the ex|ce&s;s, without intrenching upon the rea&s;onable pro|fits of exi&s;ting ones; and that they ought to be erected, as a &s;ecurity again&s;t &s;uch Banks attempting to extend their paper to the whole of the demand.</P>
<P>It is a fact a&s;certained by experience, that when|ever the capital of a Bank is inadequate to the na|tural calls originating in a regular trade, that one of two things mu&s;t happpen. 1&s;t. The Bank being incompetent to the demand will &s;pend it&s;elf in a few large loans, which, in all probability, will run in one channel. Or, 2d. It will divide its loans among the different applicants, without favour or partiality, or in reference only to their relative &s;olidity. If the Bank takes the fir&s;t cour&s;e, the intere&s;t of the &s;el|lers of produce mu&s;t &s;uffer, becau&s;e the great loans, by centring in a few buyers, will enable them to dictate the price of the produce brought to market. If the &s;econd, it mu&s;t operate again&s;t the general intere&s;t of trade, becau&s;e the cla&s;s of buyers will not get enough to excite a &s;pirited competition a|mong them, which, of it&s;elf, always rai&s;es the price of produce. Again, taking the fir&s;t alterna|tive for the practice of the Bank, the few who en|gro&s;s the principal loans, will have it in their power to influence, to a certain degree, not only the price of produce, but the price of bills of exchange, by which double operation, the community may be con&s;iderable lo&s;ers, whil&s;t, in the other alterna|tive, agriculture cannot fail to be affected through the inadequacy of the means to keep up a bri&s;k de|mand for its productions. The&s;e con&s;equences are inevitable.</P>
<P>But this is not all. We have con&s;idered it as probable only, that the large loans of &s;uch a Bank will centre in the &s;ame per&s;ons, or run in the &s;ame channel: Should, however, the charter be &s;o con|&s;tructed
<PB N="10" REF="029010_0009_0FDE8997B68E85B0">
as to admit of the &s;ame men being annually cho&s;en directors, from probable, it becomes ab&s;o|lutely certain, that the&s;e loans, will in time, be either &s;hared among the directors them&s;elves (&s;hould they be men in bu&s;ine&s;s, and want them) or among their re&s;pective favourites. It is ea&s;y to conceive the di&s;|contents, murmurs, and partialities that mu&s;t take place under &s;uch a &s;tate of things, as well as the meanne&s;s of &s;olicitation and dependence, which it is calculated to beget in the whole body of traders.</P>
<P>We have &s;aid al&s;o, that there is a certain ratio, which ought always to be ob&s;erved between the pa|per of a Bank and its capital. Ina&s;much, however, as a Bank of contracted capital will find it&s;elf &s;afe under certain circum&s;tances, in throwing paper into circulation beyond that &s;tandard, and as &s;uch op|portunities may frequently occur, e&s;pecially in the United States, there is much room for believing that they will be u&s;ed with a view to larger divi|dends, unle&s;s prevented by charter.</P>
<P>What follows? As the loans which exceed this proportion, can enjoy only a momentanious exi&s;t|ence; as the circum&s;tances which induced them change; as the &s;urplus mu&s;t quickly return upon the Bank from circulation, the Bank, in order to pre|vent a &s;toppage of payment, mu&s;t &s;uddenly bring its di&s;counts within the &s;trength of its capital to face; in other words, mu&s;t &s;u&s;pend &s;o much of its loans as has exceeded this proportion. It follows, that the portion of its debtors who received the loans forming this exce&s;s, mu&s;t be le&s;t to &s;atisfy their bank obligations, by means that often involve great pecuniary &s;acrifices, if not po&s;itive ruin, while it is fairly to be pre&s;umed that the &s;ufferers in &s;uch con|junctures will &s;eldom be met with among the directors or their favourites. Hence it is that we always find in places of great trade, where Banks of &s;mall capital only exi&s;t, tho&s;e u&s;urious practices that di&s;ap|pear
<PB N="11" REF="029010_0010_0FDE891E4CC1BB58">
after the creation of capitals &s;ufficient to &s;upport an uniform cour&s;e of di&s;counts, and prevent tho&s;e frequent, &s;udden, and unexpected &s;u&s;pen&s;ions that favour, if not generate, u&s;ury.</P>
<P>The direct inference from the&s;e con&s;iderations is, that the general intere&s;t requires, either that &s;uch a Bank &s;hould be wholly prohibited or its capital &s;ufficiently enlarged.</P>
<P>Were any further &s;upport of this inference requi|&s;ite, it maybe found in a recent application made by the directors of the Bank of Maryland, to the &s;tockholders, to add to its funds, by a payment of 100 dollars upon each &s;hare; an application expre&s;sly bottomed upon the ground, that the capital of that Bank, is too &s;mall to an&s;wer any longer the ends of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>We &s;tate al&s;o with plea&s;ure, that the directors of the Bank of Maryland have not &s;hewn any marks of public di&s;approbation to the progre&s;s of an in|&s;titution, calculated to obviate the evils annexed to contracted funds; on the contrary, they have openly countenanced its e&s;tabli&s;hment, by becoming &s;ub|&s;cribers to it, and of cour&s;e petitioners for a charter.</P>
<P>But perhaps it may be a&s;ked, will the erection of a Bank of larger capital, put an end to favouriti&s;m? will it extingui&s;h u&s;ury? will it obviate all irregula|rity in di&s;counts? We an&s;wer, it will no doubt gra|dually le&s;&s;en them, as the capital of &s;uch a Bank is made to approximate the level of demand, and en|tirely remove them when it &s;hall actually attain it.</P>
<P>Upon the whole then, there re&s;ults, from what has been &s;aid, that private convenience and public &s;afety, the intere&s;t of individuals and the general intere&s;t, will be better promoted and &s;ecured by a large than a &s;mall Bank capital.</P>
<P>But this idea will receive fuller illu&s;tration by ex|amining more in detail, according to the order we have propo&s;ed.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="12" REF="029010_0011_0FDE88BA8D4F8820">II. Certain advantages, connected with a Bank who&s;e capital is commen&s;urate to the demands ori|ginating in the cour&s;e of a regularly growing trade.</P>
<P>Among the advantages of &s;uch a capital may be reckoned, 1&s;t. Its affording a more certain and &s;teady demand for the productions of the &s;oil. 2d. Its tendency to le&s;&s;en the prices of foreign imported manufactures to the con&s;umers. 3d. Its increa&s;ing the general effort of national indu&s;try. And, 4th. Its enabling the &s;tate to make the be&s;t u&s;e of its na|tural and geographic advantages.</P>
<P N="1">I. As to its affording a more certain and &s;teady demand for the productions of the &s;oil.</P>
<P>It is certainly an object of primary importance in a country like this, where it is &s;o ea&s;y to augment the annual quantity of its productions, beyond the quantity of &s;pecie that can be employed to purcha&s;e them, to have at hand, an <HI>expan&s;ive capital,</HI> ready to be applied to every new augmentation of pro|duce. If there &s;hould exi&s;t no &s;uch capital, it is evident that the progre&s;s of agriculture mu&s;t be &s;low, and as evident, if there does, that its progre&s;s will be con&s;iderably accelerated.</P>
<P>Where a capital of this nature can be created within a &s;tate, the trader, by a loan, anticipative of a debt that is owing to him, or the &s;ale of a cargo of goods, will find him&s;elf in a &s;ituation to buy pro|duce, as fa&s;t as it can be &s;hipped, and the whole cla&s;s of purcha&s;ers (in&s;tead of a few) enabled and in|cited, to enter into competition for it, with each other, a circum&s;tance, highly favourable to an increa&s;e of price and a regular and &s;teady demand. Hence a Bank of exten&s;ive capital, by multiplying the buy|ers of produce, and the means to buy, as nece&s;&s;arily promotes agriculture, as mild &s;un&s;hine and gentle &s;howers promote vegetation.</P>
<P>A capital of this kind has another operation
<PB N="13" REF="029010_0012_0FDE892360813A60">
tending to the &s;ame point. By its facilitating the means to buy the materials for manufactures; and to the intermediate purcha&s;ers, between the con|&s;umers and maker, the means to pay for them, it fa|vours their e&s;tabli&s;hment, &amp; promotes their growth; con&s;equently creates a new demand for our produce by creating a new body of con&s;umers. It ficilitates likewi&s;e, by the introduction of more wealth, the amelioration of roads, bridges and inland naviga|tion, by means of which the expence of tran&s;por|tation is le&s;&s;ened, e&s;pecially from the di&s;tant coun|ties, to the ports of exportation; and con&s;equently the profits of the farmer proportionably increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>It merits a remark al&s;o, that in years of foreign good crops, when the demand for our produce to &s;upply the foreign con&s;umption mu&s;t decrea&s;e, the augmentation in the general wealth of the country, introduced by &s;uch a capital, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily lead to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of magazines of grain, to be held in readine&s;s for years of foreign bad crops, or our in|crea&s;ed internal con&s;umption, a mea&s;ure that mu&s;t prevent any great or &s;udden lowering of prices, and con&s;equently calculated to maintain a &s;teadine&s;s of demand, highly favourable to agriculture.</P>
<P N="2">II. As to its tendency to le&s;&s;en the price of fo|reign imported manufactures to the con&s;umers.</P>
<P>A nation that can buy what it wants with ca&s;h, is always &s;ure to purcha&s;e on better terms than the na|tion which is obliged to buy upon credit. It is a fact well known to the mercantile cla&s;s, that every cargo of goods imported from Europe, upon a credit, is of the nature of a <HI>loan</HI> to this country, for which it is charged, on the original invoice, from 15 to 30 per cent. higher than if they had been bought with ready money, or, which amounts to the &s;ame thing, than if produce had been &s;hipped to have paid for them when ordered, be&s;ides incurring, after the cre|dit
<PB N="14" REF="029010_0013_0FDE88C075728A78">
expires, at the rate of compound intere&s;t, till &s;uch time as the debt is di&s;charged.</P>
<P>Such being the ca&s;e, let us endeavour to a&s;certain the <HI>annual amount of the&s;e loans,</HI> in order to appreci|ate fully what we annually <HI>pay for them,</HI> and the im|portance of the means by which they may be avoid|ed.</P>
<P>"It is e&s;tabli&s;hed, by a recent inve&s;tigation in Great-Britain, that in the year 1791, the United States of America took from that kingdom (exclu|&s;ive of Ireland and the Briti&s;h Ea&s;t Indies, from which they import many manufactures) the value in Bri|ti&s;h manufactures of &pound;3,929,771:12:8 &s;ter." Now, as Maryland contains about a 12th part of the inhabitants of the union, it is rea&s;onable to apportion to her one 12th part of the&s;e importations. It follows therefore, that Maryland receives annually of Briti&s;h manufac|tures, to the value of about 1,500,000 dollars.</P>
<P>How much of this &s;um is obtained upon credit? A writer, who&s;e duty it was to get the be&s;t information on this point, a&s;&s;erts "that at lea&s;t <HI>four fifths</HI> of the importations from Europe into the American &s;tates, were at all times made upon credit."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Sheffield</NOTE> It mu&s;t be obvious that numerical preci&s;ion on &s;uch a &s;ubject is not to be expected. Admitting, however, the pro|portion here quoted to come near the fact, and aver|aging the co&s;t of <HI>credit</HI> to the &s;tate at 20 per cent. only upon <HI>four fifths</HI> of its importations from Great Britain, there is paid for this credit 240,000 dollars, annually, more than if produce could be exported to buy them at ca&s;h prices, independent of what is paid to other nations.</P>
<P>Is there no way by which the &s;tate may be reliev|ed from &s;o heavy an intere&s;t? Is there a &s;tate in the union which obtains her European manufactures on better terms? And is that &s;tate &s;o &s;ituated as to at|tract,
<PB N="15" REF="029010_0014_0FDE8928A4CA8888">
by this means, any part of the trade peculiar to Maryland?</P>
<P>There are at this moment, <HI>three</HI> Banks in Phi|ladelphia, who&s;e joint &s;pecie capitals may be &s;tated at about &s;even millions of dollars; and <HI>two</HI> in Bal|timore, who&s;e united capitals make only about 700,000 dollars. Suppo&s;ing, then, the European importations to be neatly equal into the&s;e towns, it re&s;ults, that the Bank facilities enjoyed by the Phi|ladelphia merchants, whether applied to the &s;hip|ment of produce, to lay in their European manu|factures at ca&s;h prices, or to avoid paying compound intere&s;t after the credit expires, is above <HI>eight</HI> times greater than the bank facilities that can be applied to the &s;ame purpo&s;es by the Baltimore merchant.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t be the final operation of this di&s;parity in the means to export produce? Need it be plainly divulged? Need it be in&s;i&s;ted upon how &s;eriou&s;ly and deeply its continuance mu&s;t affect the deare&s;t intere&s;ts of Maryland, and how important it is that the Bank capitals of the latter &s;hould be brought as near as po&s;&s;ible, and as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to a level with the former? Can the utility of &s;uch a mea&s;ure ad|mit of a moment's he&s;itation?</P>
<P>Should the &s;pirit of &s;y&s;tem, &s;eek a more compen|dious mode to rid us of this heavy intere&s;t, or re|commend a total ab&s;tinence from European im|portations, we would ob&s;erve, that the experience of 160 years pa&s;t, proves, that the people will have them, and our acknowledged deficiency of dome&s;tic manufactures, that they are ab&s;olutely indi&s;pen&s;ible.</P>
<P>There remains therefore, no other alternative for Maryland, than to continue to procure abroad, up|on <HI>credit,</HI> the manufactures which &s;he cannot do without, or to generate a bank capital which may enable the &s;tate to introduce its importations at ca&s;h prices, till &s;uch time as the e&s;tabli&s;hment and in|crea&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="029010_0015_0FDE88C5CA2D3598">
of her own manufactures &s;hall relieve from the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;orting to foreign ones.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be &s;aid on this occa&s;ion, that Banks tend to rai&s;e the prices of imported manufac|tures, ina&s;much as they have actually come higher to the con&s;umers &s;ince their introduction. We &s;hall not deny the fact as to the ri&s;e on many articles of foreign importation; but we deny the inference drawn from it, to be true. Were it a ju&s;t inference, foreign manufactures ought to be highe&s;t, where there is mo&s;t Bank capital, the rever&s;e of which is actually the ca&s;e. Were it true, the increa&s;e in the circulating medium occa&s;ioned by Bank money, ought to be &s;o great as to account of it&s;elf, for the increa&s;e in price, whereas it is demon&s;trable that the Banks do not circulate more paper than would otherwi&s;e circulate of goldor &s;ilver, the general trade and indu&s;try being the &s;ame. We mu&s;t therefore re&s;ort to other &s;ources to explain the phenomenon.</P>
<P>The&s;e are, 1&s;t. the increa&s;ed taxes of foreign na|tions, which fall upon and enhance the prices of their manufactures. This connection of things, by which a non-manufacturing nation becomes, as it were, contributary to the wars or taxes of the ma|nufacturing nation, ought to work a two-fold ef|fect. It ought to induce the nation that depends upon another for its manufactures, to u&s;e every means in its power to encourage its own, in order to free it&s;elf from &s;uch a &s;tate of dependence; and the nation furni&s;hing them, with an anxiety to avoid tho&s;e &s;ituations, which, augmenting their prices, nece&s;&s;arily precipitate &s;uch an event. 2d. The duties laid by the United States upon imported ar|ticles, which &s;erve to &s;well their prices to the con|&s;umers.</P>
<P>To the&s;e might be &s;ubjoined &s;ome other cau&s;es, which, though temporary in their nature, apply &s;trongly in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, &s;uch as higher wages
<PB N="17" REF="029010_0016_0FDE89B1B65491C0">
to &s;eamen, higher in&s;urance, greater expence in provi&s;ioning ve&s;&s;els, and of cour&s;e, higher freights, the latter only being one hundred per centum more than in times of peace; circum&s;tances which un|equivocally affect the prices of imported articles.</P>
<P>Giving therefore, to the&s;e &s;everal items their due weight in the argument, any &s;uppo&s;ed increa&s;e of the circulating medium by Bank money, cannot, with|out a violent hypothe&s;is, be charged with having pro|duced an effect &s;o clearly deducible from other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>But before di&s;mi&s;&s;ing this objection we &s;hall take the liberty to reinforce what we have advanced, by the opinions of two well known re&s;pectable writers.</P>
<P>Mr. Smith, in his Wealth of Nations, page 80, &s;ays, that "As the quantity of gold and &s;ilver which is taken from the currency, (to be lodged in the Bank,) is always equal to the quantity of paper which is added to it, paper money does not nece&s;&s;arily in|crea&s;e tha quantity of the whole currency."</P>
<P>And again, in page 79, vol. 2, the &s;ame writer remarks, "Whatever is bought or &s;old for <HI>a pa|per money, payable on demand,</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be bought or &s;old as <HI>cheap</HI> as it could have been for <HI>gold</HI> or <HI>&s;ilver,"</HI> the rea&s;on of which is, that the one is preci&s;ely of the &s;ame value as the other.</P>
<P>This objection, therefore, to Bank money, to be en|titled to the lea&s;t re&s;pect, mu&s;t be acknowledged by tho&s;e who u&s;e it, to apply as &s;trong again&s;t an equal quantity of gold or &s;ilver, as Bank money. Hence, as an increa&s;e of gold or &s;ilver mu&s;t produce the &s;ame effects in &s;ociety, as a &s;imilar increa&s;e of Bank paper, it re&s;ults, that if it is found policy to prohibit the one, it is no le&s;s found policy to prohibit the other.</P>
<P>But what is the real &s;ource and an&s;wer to this ob|jection? Is it not found in the <HI>increa&s;ed</HI> and <HI>in|crea&s;ing &s;tate of the nation's pro&s;perity,</HI> in addition to the extraneous cau&s;es already &s;ugge&s;ted?</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="029010_0017_0FDE88CB73DDE0B8">We &s;hall trouble the hou&s;e with one further quo|tation, from Douglas's Political Survey of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>"This, of all others", he ob&s;erves (vol 2. p. 242) "is the argument mo&s;t relied on by tho&s;e writers on this and the other &s;ide of the water, who que&s;tion the utility of paper credit. This, &s;ay they, without affording the &s;olid &s;upport of gold and &s;ilver, alike valued in all countries, expo&s;es us to the only evil too great a plenty of money can create&mdash;the ad|vancing the prices of all the nece&s;&s;aries and con|veniences of life. But is this the fact? May not two things exi&s;t at the &s;ame time, without one being either the cau&s;e or effect of the other? In the reign of queen Elizabeth, hou&s;es, lands, &amp;c. ro&s;e con|&s;iderably in value, though paper was not then intro|duced. May not the &s;ame, which operated at that time, and not paper credit, be the cau&s;e now? If we look clo&s;ely into the matter, perhaps we may find that &s;o it really is.</P>
<P>"In the reign of queen Elizabeth, from a variety of cau&s;es, which have been already explained, trade began to &s;pread, manufactures to increa&s;e, and ma|ny new branches of foreign commerce were opened. In con&s;equence of this, numbers of families grew into ea&s;e and independence. This cau&s;ed a greater con&s;umption of things nece&s;&s;ary, and augmented the de&s;ire of conveniences. A con&s;tant and grow|ing demand rai&s;ed the price. Trade being more flouri&s;hing, manufactures more numerous, commerce much further extended, things are become &s;till dearer from the &s;ame natural cau&s;es: For if the fruits of indu&s;try increa&s;e, <HI>however that may be effected,</HI> the con&s;umers will be more numerous, the con&s;umption larger, and the prices of many things higher. But the people, by living better, will not grow poorer. As the fact, &s;o the knowledge of this truth, is as old as the days of Elizabeth, when they did not con|ceive that <HI>money was the only property,</HI> but were wi&s;e
<PB N="19" REF="029010_0018_0FDE892DA91DA668">
enough to comprehend, that he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch things as were worth money, was really worth as much as tho&s;e things would fetch. A truth obvious then, and which, remaining a truth, will ever ap|pear &s;o upon a little reflection: And yet the over|looking it, is the &s;ole cau&s;e of this heavy charge on paper credit."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By <HI>paper credit</HI> here, is chiefly meant private notes of hand, which a change in the law of England threw into circulation, by making negociable. Before that, no action could be maintained on them, as they were not &s;pecialties. How much &s;tronger this rea&s;oning, when ap|plied to <HI>Bank paper,</HI> than the <HI>axes of individuals?</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="3">III. As to its increa&s;ing the general effort of na|tional indu&s;try:</P>
<P>We ob&s;erve upon this effect of Banks of exten&s;ive capitals, that it is not their faculty to augment the quantity of money, but their faculty of augment|ing the fruits of indu&s;try, that con&s;titute the ba&s;is of their public utility. For unle&s;s Banks were in|&s;trumental to the rai&s;ing of more produce, to the erection and fabrication of more dome&s;tic manufac|tures, to more internal improvement of every de|&s;cription, and to a more extended and profitable foreign commerce, and a more favourable balance of trade, any momentary increa&s;e of money they might ooca&s;ion, would be of <HI>no real &s;ervice to the country.</HI></P>
<P>It is this precous faculty <HI>of augmenting the fruits of indu&s;try,</HI> that confers upon Banks a &s;uperiority over every other mode of throwing money into cir|culation; for it may be &s;afely affirmed, that no given quantity of &s;pecie, lent by government to individuals, upon a long credit, or pre&s;ented to them gratis, could excite an equal degree of national improve|ment, indu&s;try, and wealth, as an equal &s;um of money, di&s;tributed upon loan, by means of a well admini&s;tered Bank. This idea may be illu&s;trated, by attending to the circum&s;tances under which
<PB N="20" REF="029010_0019_0FDE88D037442D98">
Bank money is emitted and kept in circulation. Whoever obtains a credit at Bank, is compelled to ob&s;erve the mo&s;t rigourous punctuality. Whoever, in turn, obtains a credit from him, is nece&s;&s;itated to a like ob&s;ervance of his contract; a condition, which, gradually extending it&s;elf to every cla&s;s of the community, exacts from the whole, an ince&s;&s;ant and &s;y&s;tematic indu&s;try, capable of bringing to market commodities equivalent to the amount of the general credit obtained.</P>
<P>Thus, bank money, by compelling, as it were, the community to draw from the earth and their labour, more productions, gives the &s;tronge&s;t po&s;&s;ible impul|&s;ion to genius, and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>Hence too it is, that Banks mu&s;t <HI>increa&s;e,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>dimini&s;h,</HI> the quantity of the precious metals; for, in proportion as &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments augment the exportation of tho&s;e productions, by the &s;ale of which &s;pecie is brought into the country, and enable us to buy foreign manufactures cheaper, which takes le&s;s of it from us, or, facilitates the erection of do|me&s;tic manufactures, which retains &s;till more of it with us, by their rendering foreign ones unnece&s;&s;ary, they inevitably augment the quantity of gold and &s;ilver.</P>
<P>Banks, therefore, may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as a valuable in&s;trument, to &s;well the general tide of in|du&s;try, and con&s;equently, the general ma&s;s of natio|nal wealth and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P N="4">VI. As to Banks of exten&s;ive capital enabling the &s;tate to make the be&s;t u&s;e of its natural and geogra|phic advantages.</P>
<P>The chief advantage that Penn&s;ylvania has over Maryland, in a commercial point of view, does not con&s;i&s;t in her being more favourably &s;ituated for trade, or in having a &s;oil better fitted for rai&s;ing ex|portable productions, or harbours better calculated for commerce, but in the va&s;t &s;uperiority of Bank
<PB N="21" REF="029010_0020_0FDE89330041F6B8">
capitals, which &s;he has accumulated at Philadelphia, by means of which, that market is found to be more &s;teady, and to afford, generally &s;peaking, a higher price for produce, than any market in Maryland.</P>
<P>In &s;tating this fact, we di&s;mi&s;s from our thoughts the narrow idea of drawing from Philadelphia, any part of that trade to which it is entitled, from po|&s;ition and the indu&s;try of its inhabitants. We con|tend, only, for the propriety of &s;uch Bank e&s;tabli&s;h|ments in Maryland, as may enable its citizens, to profit by their own re&s;ources and geographic &s;itua|tion. Is there a &s;tate in the union more favoura|bly &s;ituated for trade, or who&s;e productions are more wanted abroad, or who&s;e inhabitants are more capable of enterpri&s;e? What want of policy, then, to exclude the u&s;e of the means, which has been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully employed by a &s;i&s;ter &s;tate, to improve &s;imilar advantages.</P>
<P>The general welfare requires, that no town or place &s;hould be neglected; but, that the advantages which may be peculiar to each, &s;hould be improved to the extent of which they are &s;u&s;ceptible. The harmony, as well as pro&s;perity of the whole, calls upon &s;tate&s;men to give efficacy to this maxim; for it is only by each &s;tate, in conjunction with the ge|neral government, enabling its citizens to extract from their re&s;pective &s;ituations, the advantages pe|culiar to each, that either a &s;tate, or the United States, can attain to that high degree of wealth, numbers, and greatne&s;s, to which they &s;eem de&s;|tined.</P>
<P>As to the trade of Maryland, it mu&s;t be con&s;i|dered as &s;till in its infancy, at lea&s;t, as far di&s;tant from that maturity of growth to which it may be carried, by a due augmentation of pecuniary a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. Can any one &s;eriou&s;ly contemplate our uncultivated lands,&mdash;our defective hu&s;bandry&mdash;our thin population,&mdash;our irregular and un&s;teady mark|ets,
<PB N="22" REF="029010_0021_0FDE899CB5391770">
&mdash;the unimproved condition of our roads and inland navigation,&mdash;our inabilitity, without the aid of foreign commi&s;&s;ions, agents, and extra &s;tate mo|ney, to buy up our productions for exportation&mdash;our want of internal manufactures&mdash;our in&s;ufficiency of funds to participate in the fi&s;heries, and other enrich|ing &s;ources of dome&s;tic and foreign commerce&mdash;and he&s;itate to pronounce, that the field for the employ|ment of money, is almo&s;t unmea&s;urable, and that the large&s;t &s;ums which could po&s;&s;ibly be brought in|to action, would be inadequate to its full cultivation. Ah, may no &s;ini&s;ter policy, or fa&s;cinating rea&s;oning, cloud a pro&s;pect, that cannot be viewed with indif|ference, or ob&s;truct the attainment of tho&s;e means, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to its pro&s;perous enjoyment.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uing the line that we have marked for our ob&s;ervations, we are next to examine.</P>
<P N="3">III. Certain ojections that may be &s;uppo&s;ed to mi|litate again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Bank in con|templation.</P>
<P>Were we to trace the oppo&s;ition to Banks in the different countries where they have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, we &s;hould find, that it has uniformly originated in men of the following de&s;criptions.&mdash;Whenever two parties have exi&s;ted in the &s;tate, the apprehen&s;ions of one of them, that the in&s;titution would be con|verted into a political engine by the other again&s;t them, has never failed to call up the ingenuity of rea&s;oning to prevent their erection. Another pha|lanx of their enemies, not le&s;s formidable, has con|&s;i&s;ted of men in the practice of employing their ca|pitals in profitable monopolies, which it enabled them to create, or in advantages, in the way of commerce, which it enabled them to take, or in &s;ell|ing their money to government or individuals, in their exigencies and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, at a price, much be|yond its value, or the common rate of intere&s;t. As Banks &s;eemed to threaten the fir&s;t, and actually af|fected
<PB N="23" REF="029010_0022_0FDE893B25BA2C30">
the profits of the latter de&s;criptions, one cannot be &s;urpri&s;ed at the re&s;i&s;tance made to their e&s;tabli&s;h|ment by &s;uch men. But as the evils predicted by the&s;e oppo&s;ers, have been contradicted by the experience of every country, where Banks have been erected, and the arguments they have u&s;ed, refuted by wri|ters, having neither party nor &s;pecial intere&s;t con|nected with the i&s;&s;ue, we &s;hould, therefore, have pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ubject over without a &s;ingle remark, had it not been for the opportunity it pre&s;ented us with, of entering into certain details and explanations, re|lative to the con&s;truction, &s;olidity and admini&s;tration of well organi&s;ed Banks, which can only be inti|mately known to tho&s;e who may have made it a par|ticular object of &s;tudy and inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>We &s;hall, in this view, conden&s;e the objections that lead to the&s;e explanations, under two heads. 1&s;t. We &s;hall con&s;ider, whether Bank notes, as being of the nature of bills of credit or &s;tate paper, may not, like them, depreciate, and injure the country. And, 2d. Whether Banks are not ob&s;tructive to agricul|tural improvements, and promotive only of com|merce.</P>
<P N="1">I. Whether Bank notes, as being of the nature of bills of credit or &s;tate paper, may not, like them, depreciate and injure the country.</P>
<P>To this we ob&s;erve, generally, that though bills of credit, under the colony government, did not, and could not, uniformly pre&s;erve the &s;ame value as the &s;pecie they repre&s;ented, neverthele&s;s, they were of great advantage to the community. If we com|mence our enquiry on this point with the fir&s;t emi&s;|&s;ion of 1733, and follow them down to the la&s;t colo|ny emi&s;&s;ion of 1773, we &s;hall find ample rea&s;on to attribute a certain proportion of the exten&s;ion of our trade and improvements, during that period, to their operation. As an example: When the fir&s;t colony emi&s;&s;ion took place, wheat &s;old, in the ports
<PB N="24" REF="029010_0023_0FDE88D5D91324C8">
of exportation, at <HI>one third of a dollar</HI> per bu&s;hel; when the la&s;t, at <HI>three quauters of a dollar</HI>; &s;o that, in the cour&s;e of 40 years, bills of credit were in&s;tru|mental in more than doubling the price of produce. In&s;tead, therefore, of their forming an objection a|gain&s;t Bank bills, they furni&s;h a conclu&s;ive argu|ment in their favour, and the more &s;o, as Bank bills (as will be &s;hewn hereafter) po&s;&s;e&s;s all the advantages of bills of credit without their inconveniencies.</P>
<P><HI>With re&s;pect to our revolutionary paper.</HI>&mdash;As that was neither emitted to meet the demands of trade, nor could be &s;upported by trade, and be&s;ides re&s;ted on a more precarious &s;ecurity than the colony paper, it was impo&s;&s;ible that it could long maintain an equal degree of credit and public confidence; the rapid depreciation, therefore, of &s;uch paper, can form no rational objection to a paper re&s;ting upon different ground, and circulating upon oppo&s;ite principles. But, the fallacy of the objection will emerge in a &s;tronger light, by a more particular compari&s;on of the two papers.</P>
<P N="1">1. Bills of credit, the be&s;t &s;upported, were always made <HI>payable</HI> at a <HI>di&s;tant period,</HI> a circum&s;tance which could not fail, to dimini&s;h their value, and which did dimini&s;h their value.</P>
<P N="2">2. Bills of credited the <HI>funds</HI> for their <HI>redemption</HI> or &s;mal payment, wholly in the power of govern|ment, con&s;equently, liable upon every real or &s;up|po&s;ed exigency of &s;tate to be deverted to other pur|po&s;es, a circumkance that weakening confidence in the &s;ecurity, nece&s;sarily involved their depreciation.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>quantum</HI> of bills of credit emitted, being regulated by no fixed rule, but intirely dependant upon the arbitrary will of an a&s;&s;embly, could afford no ju&s;t foundation upon which to calculate their value.</P>
<P><HI>As to notes i&s;&s;ued by a properly organi&s;ed Bank</HI> (of which only we would be under&s;tood to &s;peak) every
<PB N="25" REF="029010_0024_0FDE893FB87936E0">
circum&s;tance attending them, is calculated to re|move doubt, in&s;pire confidence, confine their amount within &s;afe limits, and in&s;ure to the holders the <HI>im|mediate payment</HI> of their full value.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Every Bank has a <HI>determinate capital in &s;pecie,</HI> which if its charter is properly guarded, can never be u&s;ed for any purpo&s;e that might divert it from the payment of its notes.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Bank notes cannot be intruded upon the pub|lic at the will or <HI>plea&s;ure of directors,</HI> or in any man|ner other than by <HI>loan,</HI> and then only, upon the &s;e|curity of an ample pledge or the obligation of two or more per&s;ons competent to repay it at a <HI>&s;hort date.</HI> The holders of bank notes, therefore, have not only the &s;pecie in Bank, but the&s;e pledges or obligations as &s;ecurity for their di&s;charge.</P>
<P N="3">3d. As a well con&s;tituted Bank can never i&s;&s;ue notes to exceed the amount of the &s;pecie in its vaults and &s;ecurities pledged for payment of its loans; at all times, therefore, and in every conjuncture of its affairs, the &s;ecurities and &s;pecie, added together, mu&s;t amount to the <HI>preci&s;e &s;um</HI> of its notes in circu|lation, con&s;equently, the Bank mu&s;t be, <HI>at all times,</HI> competent to their payment.</P>
<P N="4">4th. As it is optional with tho&s;e who borrow from the Bank, to receive from it, either &s;pecie or bank notes to the amount of their loan, and with him who holds a bank note, to have it immediately ex|changed for &s;pecie, the intere&s;t of the Bank there|fore imperiou&s;ly requires, that it &s;hould always have in readine&s;s a &s;ufficient &s;um in gold or &s;ilver, to ex|change tho&s;e notes which are ince&s;&s;antly returning upon it from circulation.</P>
<P>This brief explanation of &s;ome of the circum|&s;tances under which bank notes are i&s;&s;ued, and the nature of the &s;ecurity upon which they are bottom|ed,
<PB N="26" REF="029010_0025_0FDE88E0D5D7EF28">
(to which, if we add a <HI>limitation to the amount of notes, it may circulate)</HI> cannot fail to afford a &s;olid ba&s;is for public confidence, and remove every doubt from the mo&s;t &s;crupulous mind on the &s;core of de|preciation.</P>
<P>But it may be a&s;ked, "ina&s;much as a part of the Bank notes, in circulation, may re&s;t on individual &s;ecurity, will not the bankruptcy of the&s;e per&s;ons, cau&s;e a failure of the Bank?"</P>
<P>The bankruptcy of the Bank, cannot happen from this cau&s;e; it being altogether improbable, e&s;timat|ing chances according to the ordinary cour&s;e of things, that its <HI>annual lo&s;&s;es,</HI> from &s;uch failures, can ever exceed its <HI>annual profits.</HI> It may be ob&s;erved, al&s;o, in referrence to this &s;ugge&s;tion, that it is no ways likely, that per&s;ons in a bankrupt, or tickli&s;h &s;ituation, will be favoured with its loans; becau&s;e it is the intere&s;t of directors to a&s;certain the &s;tate of men's &s;olidity, who have tran&s;actions with the Bank, and the nature of <HI>&s;hort credits</HI> and Bank tran&s;actions, above all others, to conduct in the mo&s;t expeditious manner, to this knowledge. "Directors," &s;ays a well informed writer, on this &s;ubject, "being, for the mo&s;t part, &s;elected from the cla&s;s of traders, are to be expected to po&s;&s;e&s;s, individually, an accurate knowledge of the characters and &s;ituation of tho&s;e who come within that de&s;cription; and they have, in addition to this, the cour&s;e of dealing of the per|&s;ons them&s;elves with the Bank to a&s;&s;i&s;t their judg|ment; which is in mo&s;t ca&s;es, a good index of the &s;tate in which tho&s;e per&s;ons are. The artifices and &s;hifts which tho&s;e, in de&s;perate or declining circum|&s;tances, are obliged to employ to keep up the coun|tenance which the rules of the Bank require, and the train of their connexions, are &s;o many progno&s;|tics, not difficult to be interpreted, of the fate which awaits them. Hence, it not unfrequently happens,
<PB N="27" REF="029010_0026_0FDE89475853F760">
that Banks are the fir&s;t to di&s;cover the un&s;oundne&s;s of &s;uch characters, and, by withholding credit, to announce to the public, that they are not entitled to it."</P>
<P>Upon the whole, then, it may be &s;afely affirmed, 1&s;t. That the irrelevant principles upon which Bank paper and bills of credit come into circulation, afford not the &s;hadow of a rea&s;on for apprehending a &s;imilarity in their fate. 2dly. That under the &s;afe|guard of &s;o many precautions, pledges and double &s;ecurities, it is out of the verge of probability, that &s;uch a ma&s;s of failures can happen at any one time or in &s;uch quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as to affect the &s;olidity of a well admini&s;tered Bank. 3dly. If in addition, the Bank be re&s;tricted from i&s;&s;uing, under any cir|cum&s;tances whatever, beyond a certain amount of notes, depreciation, or its bankruptcy, will be render|ed impo&s;&s;ible, except indeed in the ca&s;e of a total &s;ub|ver&s;ion of all order, property and government.</P>
<P>This point &s;ettled, let us examine, 2d. Whether Banks are not ob&s;tructive to agricultural improve|ments, and promotive only of commerce.</P>
<P>Banks, to be injurious to agriculture, mu&s;t act in one of two ways. They mu&s;t either le&s;&s;en the means to purcha&s;e produce&mdash;or they mu&s;t elicit money from, and prevent its being, employed in agricultural improvements.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> it has been already &s;hewn, that Banks of exten&s;ive capital, in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening the means to purcha&s;e produce, actually furni&s;h the whole ma&s;s of buyers with more money, in con&s;equence of which more produce is actually bought. How this is accompli&s;hed, may be further familiari&s;ed by example.</P>
<P>A merchant, with a part of his capital, &s;hips pro|duce to the We&s;t-Indies, with which he imports a cargo of &s;ugar, or coffee, the re&s;t of his capital lay|ing
<PB N="28" REF="029010_0027_0FDE88E580A6AFE0">
in debts, for goods &s;old at a &s;hort credit. If there be no Bank e&s;tabli&s;hed where he carries on his bu&s;ine&s;s, and he cannot di&s;po&s;e of his cargo for ca&s;h, or force a payment of his debts, he will not be able to buy produce, to commence a new voyage. On the other hand, if there is a Bank, it will &s;tep in with a loan, and put him in&s;tantly in a &s;ituation to load his ve&s;&s;el. Thus, delay is obviated, which is always lo&s;s, and more voyages performed in the &s;ame period, which, of cour&s;e, takes off more pro|duce from the farmer, whil&s;t, before the credit ob|tained from the Bank, expires, he finds him&s;elf in ca&s;h to reimbur&s;e the loan, either by the &s;ale of his cargo, during the interval, or the receipt of &s;ome of his debts.</P>
<P>Again&mdash;Let us &s;uppo&s;e every trader to have his capital doubled, by anticipations of &s;ales of goods, or debts, it is demon&s;trable, that each would be enabled to buy more produce, give more for it, &s;ell it abroad at a le&s;s price, than when it co&s;t him le&s;s, and yet make a greater profit upon his tran|&s;actions. To be more explicit. If a trader, with|out anticipations, by waiting the &s;low cour&s;e of &s;ales, and payments, can purcha&s;e on his capital, only 10,000 barrels of flour, annually, and fell it in a foreign market, at one dollar per barrel profit, he will clear annually, 10,000 dollars. But if he can &s;hip 20,000 barrels per annum, upon the &s;ame capital, by means of anticipations, he may give 1-8 of a dollar per barrel more for it, &s;ell it abroad for 1-8 of a dollar le&s;s, and yet, make about 5000 dollars per annum more than in the former ca&s;e; and the farmers an additional profit of 2,500 dol|lars, upon every 20,000 barrels.</P>
<P>By varying &s;uch in&s;tances to the different objects of trade, and the &s;ituation of debtors and credit|ors,
<PB N="29" REF="029010_0028_0FDE894C4C6EADA0">
we acquire di&s;tinct notions of the manner in which Banks increa&s;e the means to purcha&s;e pro|duce, without ri&s;k to the community, or the in|&s;titution.</P>
<P>That &s;uch is the preci&s;e cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s and profits, to both farmer and merchant, as capitals augment, is a fact well known in the commercial world; and, hence it is, that Banks of exten&s;ive capitals have never failed, wherever e&s;tabli&s;hed, to give new energies to agriculture.</P>
<P>Ina&s;much, therefore, as Banks do not le&s;&s;en, but increa&s;e the means to purcha&s;e produce, and actu|ally cau&s;e more produce to be purcha&s;ed, the &s;e|cond part of the objection, which &s;uppo&s;es, Banks to elicit money <HI>from, or prevent its being employed in, agricultural improvements,</HI> might be con&s;idered as already an&s;wered: For, &s;peaking in the ab&s;tract, it would be ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that Banks draw money from agriculture, and at the &s;ame time occa&s;ion its progre&s;s and improvement.</P>
<P>To examine, however, the objection by another criterion, let us enquire, to which &s;ide of the que&s;|tion experience inclines; for, which ever way this index points, ought to have greater influence upon the candid mind, than whole volumes of &s;prightly theory, or ingenious declamation.</P>
<P>We obtain a ju&s;t opinion of the utility or hurt|fulne&s;s of in&s;titutions, from a correct knowledge of their effects upon indu&s;try, derived either from our own experience, or, where we have had no opportunity of ob&s;erving them our&s;elves, from the experience of men in who&s;e veracity and &s;ound|ne&s;s of judgment, we have ju&s;t rea&s;on to confide.</P>
<P>When both concur to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame point, it would &s;hew the height of &s;ceptici&s;m, to reject their combined evidence.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="029010_0029_0FDE88EDDA71DA08">With re&s;pect to the experience of others. "To the Banks of Scotland (&s;ays &s;ir James Stewart, in his political oeconomy) the improvement of that country is intirely owing." A more &s;y&s;tematic writer, (Mr. Adam Smith, in his inquiry into the nature and cau&s;es of the wealth of nations) &s;ays, "I have heard it a&s;&s;erted, that the trade of the city of Gla&s;gow, doubled in about fifteen years after the fir&s;t creation of the Banks there; and that the trade of Scotland, has more than quadrupled &s;ince the fir&s;t creation of the two public Banks at Edinburgh, of which the one called the Bank of Scotland, was e&s;|tabli&s;hed by act of parliament 1695, the other called the Royal Bank, by royal charter in 1727. Whether the trade, either of Scotland in general, or the city of Gla&s;gow in particular, has really increa&s;ed in &s;o great a proportion during &s;o &s;hort a period, I do not pre|tend to know. If either of them has increa&s;ed in this proportion, it &s;eems to be an effect too great to be accounted for by the &s;ole operation of this cau&s;e. That the trade and <HI>indu&s;try</HI> of Scotland, however, have increa&s;ed very con&s;iderably, during this period, and that the Banks have contributed a good deal to this increa&s;e, cannot be doubled."</P>
<P>This evidence therefore, as it re&s;pects the operation of Banks upon the general <HI>indu&s;try</HI> and <HI>improve|ments</HI> of Scotland, is clear and conclu&s;ive. But the generative power of Banks, is far from being confined to Scotland. Wherever we trace them, whether in Italy, Germany, Holland, England, or the United States of America, we find the &s;ame ef|fects invariably following their e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>As to our own experience, &s;electing from this enu|meration the United States, we think we plainly perceive, in the <HI>va&s;t increa&s;e in the exports of its native productions,</HI> &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Banks, the mo&s;t indubitable evidence of their benign influence
<PB N="31" REF="029010_0030_0FDE8950AA5B71E0">
upon agriculture; at lea&s;t, if we do not, with Sir James Stewart, a&s;cribe this improved &s;tate of the country "intirely to Banks," we may &s;afely affirm, to u&s;e the cautious language of Mr. Smith, "that our agricultural productions have increa&s;ed very con|&s;iderably &s;ince their e&s;tabli&s;hment, and, that the Banks have contributed a good deal to this increa&s;e, cannot be doubted."</P>
<P>It follows, from this review of the actual &s;tate of things, that Banks enable the agriculturali&s;t to ex|tend his improvements, and bring more produce to market, con&s;equently, that, in&s;tead of withdrawing from his means, they on the contrary, increa&s;e them.</P>
<P>But as there is another form into which the ob|jection may be ca&s;t, of a more particular and &s;peci|ous nature, it may not be improper to con&s;ider it.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, "that ina&s;much as the profits of Banking are greater than lawful intere&s;t, it mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily induce money lenders to ve&s;t their money in &s;uch in&s;titutions, in preference to lending it to farmers a circum&s;tance amounting to a po&s;itive withdrawal of money from agriculture."</P>
<P>The maxim upon which this argument re&s;ts, viz. that the greater profit will always be prefered to the le&s;&s;er, though true in the main, is qualified in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, by the following exceptions.</P>
<P>The cla&s;s of men, mo&s;t in the practice of lend|ing to farmers, live in the country, and participate in the habits peculiar to a country life. Attached to the &s;oil, a mortgage on land according to their &s;ettled fa&s;hion of thinking, offers a better bottomed &s;ecurity than the be&s;t con&s;tituted Bank. At a di&s;|tance too from &s;uch in&s;titutions, they feel a certain kind of di&s;tru&s;t in them which is only to be removed by an intimate knowledge of their principles, and the mode of their conducting bu&s;ine&s;s. The&s;e cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="32" REF="029010_0031_0FDE88F2A91C4AC0">
alone, form &s;trong checks to &s;uch men, ve&s;ting their money in Banks. Admitting, however, what may happen, that a few loans will be diverted from the farmer by this means, may we not confi|dently affirm, that the lo&s;s to agriculture, if any, is counterbalanced by infinitely greater advantages? Such private loans, like partial &s;howers in a &s;ea&s;on of general drougth, can at be&s;t fall upon a few fields, while the operations of the Bank, like the inundations of the Nile, &s;pread over and fertili&s;e a whole country.</P>
<P>But that the loans which may be thus diverted from the farmers, can never be &s;o con&s;iderable as to form a &s;olid objection to the in&s;titution, will be ren|dered &s;till more apparent, by attending to the de|&s;cription of per&s;ons who con&s;titute the great body of &s;tockholders. It is a fact, that the men who hold the principal part of the &s;tock of the different Banks in the United States, have never been in the prac|tice of lending to farmers. The&s;e con&s;i&s;t, chiefly, of merchants&punc; per&s;ons who have retired from trade, re&s;idents in towns and foreigners, men, who from habits and &s;ituation, will always prefer government &s;ecurities, permanent town rents, or &s;uch property as may be <HI>readily converted into &s;pecie,</HI> to the be&s;t mort|gages that any farmer of any country can offer them. From &s;uch characters, while &s;uch objects of profit exi&s;t, were all Banks to be de&s;troyed, farmers can have little or no expectation of loans. This de|&s;cription of men will always form the great ma&s;s of &s;tockholders in Banks.</P>
<P>But the objection meets a further reply in the actual &s;tate of things. There are at this moment &s;ix chartered Banks in the United States, in which &s;hares may be purcha&s;ed to a greater amount than the capital contemplated for the pro|po&s;ed in&s;titution, and at a price to yield to the buy|ers about 9 per centum per annum for their money.
<PB N="33" REF="029010_0032_0FDE8955F87C4808">
If, therefore, the highe&s;t intere&s;t is to decide money lenders, as to the application of their money, the withholding the &s;olicited charter can make no dif|ference in point of loans to the farmer, as &s;uch mu&s;t prefer a ve&s;tment of their money in exi&s;ting in&s;ti|tutions.</P>
<P>Again&mdash;This objection does not &s;eem to have had any weight a&s;&s;igned to it in Penn&s;ylvania. The farmers there, after granting a charter to the Bank of North-America, for 2,000,000 of dollars, &s;pe|cie, and &s;eeing another Bank e&s;tabli&s;hed in Phila|delphia, by the United States, for 10,000,000 of dollars, granted a charter for a third Bank, in the &s;ame city, with a capital of 3,000,000 of dollars, in which they intere&s;ted the &s;tate, as a &s;tockholder. We do not hear that the&s;e farmers complain that they have been embarra&s;&s;ed by the&s;e Banks&mdash;that they have prevented their obtaining loans&mdash;or that it is more difficult for them now, than when they did not exi&s;t, to carry on their improvements; on the contrary, they find them&s;elves enabled to bring more produce to market, and at the &s;ame time, a market better able to pay for it; are more at their ea&s;e, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of more money, getting fa&s;t out of debt, and their lands greatly increa&s;ed in value; and be&s;ides, have attracted into the &s;tate, by means of the&s;e in&s;titutions, a large amount of &s;pecie, which, had they not been e&s;tabli&s;hed, would not have found its way thither. May it not then, be permitted to Maryland, to calculate upon &s;imi|lar re&s;ults, from &s;imilar e&s;tabli&s;hments? And does it not follow, as an undeniable con&s;equence, that in|&s;tead of diverting loans from the farmer, the inva|riable operation of Banks of exten&s;ive capital, is, to increa&s;e his profit, augment his wealth, and ex|tend his improvements.</P>
<P>From the whole, then, of the&s;e facts and ob&s;er|vations,
<PB N="34" REF="029010_0033_0FDE88F9B2DCA528">
we conclude, that, a &s;mall Bank capital, comports only with a proportionably limited de|mand, and &s;tationary trade&mdash;that where the de|mand is greatly beyond the capital of a Bank to &s;upply, both individuals and the community, are expo&s;ed to &s;erious inconveniencies and injuries&mdash; that the capital of a Bank, to an&s;wer the end of its in&s;titution, ought to be commen&s;urate to the de|mands of trade, and "grow with its growth;"&mdash; that the large Bank capitals in Philadelphia, with|out counterbalancing capitals in Maryland, mu&s;t gradually, and irre&s;i&s;tibly, take from this &s;tate, much of its weight and importance, by attracting hence a con&s;iderable portion of its commerce; and finally, that as the &s;tate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es materials and re|&s;ources for a great and progre&s;&s;ive trade, Bank ca|pitals, co-exten&s;ive with the&s;e objects, is become nece&s;&s;ary, upon high con&s;iderations of dignity, in|tere&s;t, and policy.</P>
<P>Having thus briefly &s;tated the rea&s;ons which have conduced to an a&s;&s;ociation for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Bank of exten&s;ive capital, we &s;hall now &s;ubmit a few explanations, touching the mo&s;t characteri&s;tic features of the propo&s;ed in&s;titution.</P>
<P>The annexed &s;ketch of a charter, contemplates an original capital of 3,000,000 of dollars, payable in five equal in&s;talments, in the cour&s;e of ten years, be&s;ides, an augmentation eventual and provi&s;ory.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Propo&s;ition,</NOTE></P>
<P>As there can be no doubt entertained but that our trade will furni&s;h full employment for this capital, in the order it is to evolve, and as we may calculate, with a moral certainty, upon its progre&s;&s;ive exten&s;ion, far beyond the provi&s;ory augmentation of capital to &s;atisfy, unle&s;s checked by &s;ome great national cala|mity, we &s;hall add a remark of Mr. Hume's, in con|firmation of what we have &s;aid re&s;pecting the proprie|ty
<PB N="35" REF="029010_0034_0FDE895AC38682F8">
of a progre&s;&s;ive capital, viz. that "the good policy of the magi&s;trate, con&s;i&s;ts in keeping money &s;till in|crea&s;ing, in proportion to the progre&s;&s;ive improve|ments in &s;ociety."</P>
<P>In the&s;e lights, the propo&s;ed capital cannot be con|&s;idered as too large, or its augmentative quality as a defect in the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>As to the regulations under which the &s;ub&s;crip|tion, for the three millions have been filled, we would ob&s;erve, that it is not practicable, perhaps, to lay down rules for taking &s;ub&s;criptions, in &s;uch ca&s;es, which can prevent &s;peculation, and at the &s;ame time, pre&s;erve a due di&s;tribution of the &s;hares. If in form|ing them, we have not been more &s;ucce&s;sful than others, who have preceded us in like experiments, we flatter our&s;elves, at lea&s;t, to have fallen upon provi&s;ions, which mu&s;t defeat the object of &s;peculati|on, &s;hould any have been practi&s;ed. In this view, the charter, 1. Fixes the times of payments unalter|ably. 2. Declares an ab&s;olute forfeiture of right to the in&s;talments unpaid in every in&s;tance of non|compliance. And, 3. Orders a new &s;ub&s;cription to be opened for all forfeited &s;hares, upon original terms. The&s;e provi&s;ions (&s;hould any per&s;ons have &s;ub&s;cribed for more &s;hares than they <HI>can pay for,</HI> in the expec|tation of &s;elling), will &s;trip them of all &s;uch, before the appointment of directors. They will al&s;o have the effect, to keep the &s;hares at market, at the <HI>natu|ral price</HI> in the intervals between the &s;everal in&s;tal|ments, becau&s;e, tho&s;e who may want to buy, will expect to obtain forfeited &s;hares upon original terms, when the in&s;talment becomes due from failures of payment, and becau&s;e, tho&s;e who find that they cannot comply with the approaching in&s;talment, will be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ell at the natural price, rather than di&s;cover their inability to pay.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Propo&s;ition.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="029010_0035_0FDE88FE6C6EC950">It may be &s;aid, in &s;upport of the&s;e regulations, that they are better calculated to give diffu&s;ivene&s;s to the &s;hares, than regulations to oblige &s;ub&s;cribers, to de|po&s;ite a part of the money on each &s;hare, at the in|&s;tant of &s;ub&s;cribing. It may be &s;aid, too, that the requiring a depo&s;it of money, at a time when it cannot be employed, would deprive men of &s;hares, who might be in a &s;ituation to pay for them as &s;oon as it could, while it would open a field to men who might be better provided at the in&s;tant of &s;ub&s;cribing, to engro&s;s largely, and &s;ell out at lei&s;ure.

<P>Although the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive increa&s;e of Bank capital forms of it&s;elf a barrier again&s;t an inordinate circu|lation of paper; yet that no avenue might remain open on &s;o delicate a point, we have introduced a clau&s;e which fixes an ab&s;olute proportion between the Bank paper and its coin.</P>
<P>In fixing this proportion we have con&s;ulted the be&s;t writers, and the experience of men, the be&s;t in|formed in &s;uch matters, between whom we find a perfect coincidence of opinion. According to Mr. <HI>Megins,</HI> the Bank of England keeps always in coin, ready to meet exchanges, <HI>one third</HI> of the value of its notes in circulation. Such al&s;o is the proportion ob&s;erved in the Banks of the United States, when admini&s;tered with prudence, and without a regard to inordinate dividends. This proportion, there|fore, which may be con&s;idered as forming the point of &s;afety to Banks and the public, cannot be ex|ceeded by the directors of the propo&s;ed Bank, without being an&s;werable for the con&s;equences in their private capacities, and being rendered ineligi|ble to office for ever after. Hence, the public can never be inundated with paper, or have every ave|nue of circulation filled with Bank notes.</P>
<P>The United States Bank, which is, perhaps, the be&s;t organi&s;ed Bank in the world, has a limitation predicated upon this principle, but admitting of a greater latitude of circulation. It is to be ob&s;erved, however, that the annual conver&s;ion of a part of its
<PB N="39" REF="029010_0038_0FDE89649E571318">
funded debt into &s;pecie (which con&s;titutes 3.4ths of its capital) mu&s;t gradually bring the proportion of notes it may circulate within this practical rule.</P>
<P>There is another circum&s;tance that may be men|tioned, as confirmatory of the propriety of the adoption of this proportion. Since the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the Bank of England, in 1694, down to the pre&s;ent time, that nation has &s;u&s;tained forty years of war, exclu&s;ive of that in which it is yet engaged; during which period, taking the &s;tate|ments, found in Ander&s;on's Chronological Hi&s;tory of Commerce, and other documents of an authen|tic nature, for data, by which to a&s;certain the amount of its circulation, it appears, that it mu&s;t have adhered, <HI>in general,</HI> to the proportion as laid down by Mr. Megins. Seeing, therefore, that this proportion has &s;tood the te&s;t of &s;uch a length of time, as well in war as peace, the Bank which a|dopts it for an invariable and fundamental rule, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as re&s;ting upon the mo&s;t perma|nent foundation.</P>
<P>That this re&s;triction, which mu&s;t forever prevent the Bank from &s;urcharging circulation with its pa|per, comports with a due regard to the <HI>&s;pecial in|tere&s;t of the &s;tockholders,</HI> as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the general intere&s;t of the community, will appear evident, in con&s;idering the following important provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The charter propo&s;es, a dividend of ten per cent. to the &s;tockholders, as often as it ari&s;es out of the bu&s;ine&s;s; and further, to divide equally between them and the &s;tate, the profits of every <HI>three years,</HI> which &s;hall exceed an average of ten per cent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Propo&s;ition.</NOTE></P>
<P>As &s;ome have affected to con&s;ider this divi&s;ion of profit, between the &s;tockholders and the public, in the nature of a bribe to government, for a charter,
<PB N="40" REF="029010_0039_0FDE89090E575F18">
and others, as u&s;hering in a new rule in &s;uch ca&s;es, we &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, that the <HI>principle</HI> is &s;anctioned by <HI>general practice,</HI> and that the <HI>practice</HI> is founded in <HI>&s;trict ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the <HI>practice.</HI> It is notorious, that the charter of the Bank of England, was paid for by a loan to government, of &pound;. 1,200,000 &s;terling, on much better terms than it was obtainable el&s;e|where, and that every renewal of its charter, has been purcha&s;ed in like manner. To mention in|&s;tances&mdash;In 1742, that Bank advanced &pound;1,600,000 to government, without intere&s;t. At another time, it paid, &pound;100,000, which was neither to bear an in|tere&s;t, nor yet, to be repaid.</P>
<P>In 1781, it agreed to lend government &pound;2,000,000 for <HI>three</HI> years, at three per cent. which, though equal to about &pound;100,000, was &s;trongly objected to in parliament, as an inadequate equivalent for the exten&s;ion of the charter for 21 years. We find, al&s;o, to pur&s;ue the &s;ubject, that &s;imilar equivalents have been paid to their government, by the Banks of Genoa, Naples, and other like Banks of circulation for their charters, long before the erection of the Bank of England, &s;o that the legi&s;lature of England, in this re&s;pect, have only followed a pre-exi&s;tent practice.</P>
<P>We <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, that the &s;ame practice has al&s;o governed the United States. By the charter of the Bank of the United States, government is permitted to &s;ub|&s;cribe 2,000,000 of dollars, &s;pecie, and to withdraw it by way of loan, for ten years, reimbur&s;able in equal annual in&s;talments, at an intere&s;t not exceeding &s;ix per cent. and to enjoy a dividend upon the whole &s;um, as if no part of it had been withdrawn, in other words, government is to draw a dividend from the Bank for ten years, upon money not advanced. This equivalent which is certainly con&s;iderable, was objected to in congre&s;s, as in&s;ufficient for a charter
<PB N="41" REF="029010_0040_0FDE896A80377B20">
of 20 years. A like equivalent is likewi&s;e &s;tipulated for by the government of Penn&s;ylvania in the charter erecting a &s;tate Bank.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts, we pre&s;ume, are &s;ufficiently pointed and numerous to prove, that the principle of this provi&s;ion is &s;trictly conformable to the <HI>general prac|tice.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>ju&s;tice of the principle.</HI> Would it be ju&s;t, it may be a&s;ked, for a government, to grant to a few individuals, a lucrative trade, attended with little trouble, and require no equivalent for the grant? Government could not &s;upport &s;uch a proceeding upon the ground of the trade of the company ope|rating beneficially to the community, that being an effect <HI>not &s;tipulated for,</HI> or which the company do not engage, &s;hall be produced by their trade. Neither could it be ju&s;tified upon the ground, that the profit is only equal to the ri&s;k, becau&s;e, in truth, there is no ri&s;k in the bu&s;ine&s;s; and if there was, other in|dividuals of the community, who lend money under the <HI>general law,</HI> mu&s;t run an equal ri&s;k, and yet be &s;atisfied with a le&s;s profit. Nor, could government with propriety alledge, that men could not be in|duced to ve&s;t their money in &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s, were its profits to be <HI>re&s;tricted,</HI> the fact being otherwi&s;e, as in the ca&s;e of the Bank of the United States, which, in fixing limits to the quantity of paper that may be circulated, e&s;tabli&s;hed, in fact, a re&s;triction upon its profits, and as is further evidenced, by the li&s;t of &s;ub&s;cribers to the propo&s;ed in&s;titution, who have a|greed to a re&s;triction. Again, were the &s;uppo&s;ition of the <HI>theori&s;ts,</HI> who oppo&s;e &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments, to be ad|mitted, viz. that Banks are in certain re&s;pects, injuri|ous to the community, could government upon that ground be ju&s;tified in granting a charter, with|out exacting <HI>damages</HI> in the grant, to the amount of the <HI>injuries &s;u&s;tained.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="029010_0041_0FDE890E5DE0BE20">Each of the&s;e ca&s;es, then, evince the ju&s;tice of the principle, or propriety of the re&s;triction. But its ju&s;tice re&s;ts upon arguments of a yet more po&s;itive nature.</P>
<P>The fact is, when government grants a banking charter, it creates an artificial per&s;on, which did not exi&s;t before, and endows it with <HI>civil rights</HI> and <HI>at|tributes</HI> of great and exten&s;ive importance. What|ever, therefore, is particularly <HI>gained</HI> by this charter, by tho&s;e to whom it is granted, which they could not gain, or obtain without it, demands a cor|re&s;pondent <HI>compen&s;ation.</HI> To render this idea more &s;imple. A &s;tate, which incorporates a Bank, <HI>grants</HI> to its &s;tockholders, an exemption of their private fortune, (except &s;o much thereof as con&s;i&s;ts in Bank &s;tock) from all engagements entered into, or debts owing by the Bank, of what nature &s;oever, and <HI>takes</HI> from every other citizen or company, a <HI>right</HI> which they would otherwi&s;e have retained, to recover from each of the &s;tockholders, to the amount of the notes they may re&s;pectively hold, in the event of a deficien|cy in its funds or exigible effects. Here then is &s;ome|thing plainly <HI>given</HI> to the Bank, and &s;omething as plainly <HI>taken</HI> from the people.</P>
<P>A &s;tate grants another important privilege to a Bank, when it <HI>permits</HI> its notes to be paid in taxes and public dues, and <HI>refu&s;es</HI> the &s;ame privilege to notes i&s;&s;ued by individuals, private companies, or &s;imilar in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>A Bank is al&s;o particularly benefited, when a &s;tate engages to depo&s;it in its vaults, its unappropriated and other monies. For, ina&s;much as the time &s;uch monies may remain in Bank, can be exactly known to its directors, hence, operations upon this money may be predicated with as much &s;afety and certainty, as if it made a part of the Bank's capital, a circum|&s;tance that gives to the depo&s;its of a &s;tate a &s;triking &s;uperiority over the fluctuating depo&s;its of individuals.</P>
<P>For &s;uch grants, relinqui&s;hments, privileges, and
<PB N="43" REF="029010_0042_0FDE897186B4F310">
advantages, an equivalent return becomes perfect|ly ju&s;t, for where value is &s;o plainly given, payment cannot be rightfully refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>We believe it to be unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing further, to conclude for the ju&s;tice of the principle. The only que&s;tion, then, that can fairly ari&s;e on this occa&s;ion, mu&s;t re&s;pect the quantum of compen&s;ation to the &s;tockholders, and equivalent to be allowed to the &s;tate. How ought this to be a&s;certained?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing a gro&s;s &s;um to be fixed on by the par|ties, as that mu&s;t be &s;ettled by arbitrary opinion or compromi&s;e, &s;o it might be either too much for the &s;tockholders to give, or too little for the &s;tate to re|ceive in lieu of its grant. It has been thought, therefore, better to decline this mode of adju&s;tment in favour of a fixed rule, founded upon the &s;olid rights of the parties, and coexi&s;tent with the dura|tion of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>The ordinary profit upon money employed in a regular cour&s;e of trade will, perhaps, form the true&s;t &s;tandard by which to determine the compen|&s;ation that ought to be allowed to the &s;tockholders. Upon the pre&s;umption, then that this profit averages about 10 per cent. the charter &s;ecures to the &s;tock|holders a dividend equal to that &s;um, as often as the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall net as much, and as a re&s;ource again&s;t years of &s;hort compen&s;ation, half the profits upon every three year's dividends, that &s;hall exceed, upon an average, ten per cent. re&s;erving to the &s;tate the other half of the exce&s;s, as a con&s;tantly accruing equivalent for the charter.</P>
<P>This divi&s;ion of profit, we flatter our&s;elves, will appear &s;trictly conformable to di&s;tributive ju&s;tice. But it may be a&s;ked, after a&s;&s;igning ten per cent. to the &s;tockholders, for the u&s;e of their money, how much will remain to the &s;tate, for the u&s;e of its charter?</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="029010_0043_0FDE8913AB847120">To this que&s;tion, it may be &s;atisfactorily an&s;wered, that as the different Banks in the United States, average above twelve per centum upon their &s;pecie capital, it is to be pre&s;umed that the propo&s;ed Bank, will not average a le&s;s dividend (of which there can be no doubt&punc;) The &s;tate will therefore receive (taking the&s;e data for a ground of calculation) dur|ing the operation of the whole of the fir&s;t in&s;tal|ment, 6000 dollars per annum; during the &s;econd, 12,000 dollars per annum; during the third, 18,000 dollars per annum; during the fourth, 24,000 dol|lars per annum; and, during the fifth, 30,000 dollars per annum; or, in ten years, the &s;um of 180,000 dollars, and when the capital &s;hall have reached its eventual and provi&s;ory limitation, 90,000 dollars annually, forever, independent of what it may divide as a &s;tockholder, &s;hould it be|come one.</P>
<P>And here we cannot forbear mentioning an ad|vantage that re&s;ults from this arrangement of pro|fits. This provi&s;ion, and its collateral ones,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Propo&s;itions.</NOTE> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily give a publicity to the real annual profits of the Bank, and the amount of its circulation, which mu&s;t attach to the in&s;titution, a confidence that no other Bank, differently con&s;tructed, can po&s;&s;ibly enjoy, and repel from it, at the &s;ame time, tho&s;e fears and &s;u&s;picions of an exce&s;&s;ive circula|tion of paper that my&s;tery and a want of know|ledge of its real profits naturally beget. This check, as precious to the public, as it is compati|ble with the true intere&s;t of the in&s;titution, who&s;e credit it mu&s;t render perpetual, cannot be too high|ly appreciated.</P>
<P>This provi&s;ion pre&s;ents another idea, with which we &s;hall clo&s;e the &s;ubject. The &s;ource from which this profit to the &s;tate is derived, &s;eems to point to
<PB N="45" REF="029010_0044_0FDE8977A267EC20">
the propriety of de&s;tining it to works of public utility. It is &s;ubmitted, therefore, as a propo&s;ition for con&s;ideration, whether it might not be proper, to appropriate a certain part thereof, to objects of a public nature&mdash;&s;uch as the improvement of towns, roads, and inland navigation; and to pledge the faith of the legi&s;lature, in the act of incorporation, that the &s;ame &s;hall be, forever, &s;acredly applied to the&s;e purpo&s;es.</P>
