<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON THE MANNERS OF THE GREAT.</HEAD>
<P>TO a large and honourable cla&s;s of the community, to per&s;ons con&s;iderable in reputation, important by their condition in life, and commendable for the decency of their general conduct, the&s;e &s;light hints are re&s;pectfully addre&s;&s;ed. They are not intended as a &s;atire upon vice, or a ridicule upon folly, being written neither for the fooli&s;h nor the vicious. The &s;ubject is too &s;erious for ridicule; and tho&s;e to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed are too re&s;pectable for &s;atire. It is recommended to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e who, filling the higher ranks in life, are naturally regarded as patterns, by which
<PB N="4" REF="021271_0003_0FB2B3DB1B5B43F0">
the manners of the re&s;t of the world are to be fa&s;hioned.</P>
<P>The ma&s;s of mankind, in mo&s;t places, and in mo&s;t conditions of life, is perhaps chiefly compo&s;ed of what may be termed <HI>good kind of people;</HI> for per&s;ons of very flagitious wickedne&s;s are almo&s;t as rare as tho&s;e of very eminent piety: to the latter of the&s;e, admonition were impertinent; to the for|mer it were &s;uperfluous. The&s;e remarks, therefore, are principally written with a view to tho&s;e per&s;ons of rank and fortune who live within the re&s;traints of moral ob|ligation, and acknowledge the truth of the Chri&s;tian religion: and who, if in certain in&s;tances they allow them&s;elves in practices not compatible with a &s;trict profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, &s;eem to do it rather from ha|bit and want of reflection, than either from di&s;belief of its doctrines, or contempt of its precepts.</P>
<P>Incon&s;ideration, Fa&s;hion, and the World,
<PB N="5" REF="021271_0004_0FB2B3DC92903280">
are three confederates again&s;t Virtue, with whom even good kind of people often con|trive to live on excellent terms; and the fair reputation which may be obtained by a complai&s;ant conformity to the prevailing practice, and by mere decorum of manners, without a &s;trict attention to religious prin|ciple, is a con&s;tant &s;ource of danger to the rich and great. There is &s;omething almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tibly &s;educing in the contagion of ge|neral example: hence the nece&s;&s;ity of that vigilance, which it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of Chri&s;|tianity to quicken by ince&s;&s;ant admonition, and of the world, to lay a&s;leep by the per|petual opiates of ea&s;e and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>A fair reputation is one of the mo&s;t lau|dable objects of human ambition; yet even this really valuable ble&s;&s;ing is &s;ometimes converted into a &s;nare, by inducing a trea|cherous &s;ecurity as &s;oon as it is obtained. A fatal indolence is apt to creep in upon the &s;oul when it has once acquired the good
<PB N="6" REF="021271_0005_0FB2B3DE03C5F140">
opinion of mankind, if the acqui&s;ition of that good opinion was the ultimate end of its endeavours. Pur&s;uit is at an end when the object is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; for he is not likely to "pre&s;s forward" who thinks he has already "attained."&mdash;The love of worldly reputation, and the de&s;ire of God's favour, have this &s;pecific difference, that in the latter, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion always augments the de&s;ire; and the &s;piritual mind accounts nothing done while any thing remains un|done.</P>
<P>But after all, a fair fame, and the &s;upport of numbers, is obviou&s;ly a deceitful depen|dence; for as every individual mu&s;t die for him&s;elf, and an&s;wer for him&s;elf, both the&s;e imaginary re&s;ources will fail, ju&s;t at the mo|ment when they could have been of any u&s;e. A good reputation, even without internal pi|ety, would be worth obtaining, if the tribu|nal of heaven were fa&s;hioned after the manner of human courts of judicature. If at the
<PB N="7" REF="021271_0006_0FB2B3E4CCDA7B48">
general judgment we were to be tried by a jury of our fellow mortals, it would be but common prudence to &s;ecure their favour at any price. But it can &s;tand us in little &s;tead in the great day of deci&s;ion, as it is the con&s;ummation of infinite goodne&s;s, not to abandon us to the mercy of each other's &s;entence; but to re&s;erve us for <HI>his</HI> final judgment who knows every motive of eve|ry action; who will make &s;trict inqui&s;iti|on into &s;incerity of heart, and uprightne&s;s of intention; in who&s;e eyes an ineffectual prayer, or a powerle&s;s wi&s;h, will outweigh the mo&s;t &s;plendid profe&s;&s;ion, or the mo&s;t dazzling action.</P>
<P>We cannot but rejoice in every degree of human virtue which operates favourably on &s;ociety, whatever be the motive, or whoever be the actor; and we &s;hould glad|ly commend every degree of goodne&s;s, tho' it be not &s;quared by our own rules and no|tions. Even the good actions of &s;uch per|&s;ons
<PB N="8" REF="021271_0007_0FB2B3E6463FB370">
as are too much actuated by a regard to appearances, are not without their be|neficial effects. The righteou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e who occupy this middle region of morality certainly exceeds the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees; for they are not on|ly exact in ceremonials, but in many re|&s;pects fulfil the weightier matters of law and con&s;cience. Like Herod, they often "hear gladly, and do many things."&mdash;Yet I am afraid I &s;hall be thought &s;evere in remarking that, in general, tho&s;e cha|racters in the New Te&s;tament, of who&s;e future condition no very comfortable hope is given, &s;eem to have been taken, not from the profligate, the abandoned, and the di&s;honourable; but from that decent cla&s;s commonly de&s;cribed by the term of <HI>good &s;ort of people;</HI> that mixed kind of cha|racter in which virtue appears, if it does not predominate. The young Ruler was certainly one of the fir&s;t of this order; and
<PB N="9" REF="021271_0008_0FB2B3E7C49C5410">
yet we are left in dark uncertainly, as to his final allotment. The rich man who built him barns and &s;torehou&s;es, and only propo&s;ed to him&s;elf the full enjoyment of that fortune, which, perhaps, he had very fairly obtained, might have been, for all that appears to the contrary, a very good &s;ort of man: at lea&s;t, if we may judge of him by multitudes who live preci&s;ely for the &s;ame purpo&s;es, and yet enjoy a good degree of credit, and are rather con&s;idered as objects of admiration than of cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t alarming in&s;tance is that of the &s;plendid, and not illiberal Epicure, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared &s;umptuou&s;ly every day. He com|mitted no enormities that have been tran&s;|mitted to us; for that he dined well, and dre&s;&s;ed well, could hardly incur the bitter penalty of eternal mi&s;ery. That his ex|pences were &s;uitable to his &s;tation, and his &s;plendour proportioned to his opulence,
<PB N="10" REF="021271_0009_0FB2B3E962408E00">
does not exhibit any objection to his cha|racter. Nor does he appear to have refu|&s;ed the crumbs which Lazarus &s;olicited: on the contrary, it is probable that the re|putation of his bounty drew the needy pe|titioner to his gate. Here is magnificence which is uncen&s;urable, and here is bounty which is meritorious. And yet this man, on an authority which we are not permit|ted to que&s;tion, is repre&s;ented, in a future &s;tate, as <HI>lifting up his eyes, being in torments.</HI> His puni&s;hment &s;eems to have been the con&s;equence of an irreligious, worldly &s;pi|rit, a heart corrupted by the &s;oftne&s;&s;es and delights of life. It was not becau&s;e he was rich, but becau&s;e he tru&s;ted in riches; it was not that he was uncharitable, but that his charity wanted the principle which alone could &s;anctify it. His views termi|nated here; this world's good, and this world's applau&s;e, were the motives and the end of his actions. He forgot God; he
<PB N="11" REF="021271_0010_0FB2B3EAF442FF70">
was de&s;titute of piety; and the ab&s;ence of this great and fir&s;t principle of human ac|tions, rendered his &s;hin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ng deeds, however they might be admired among men, of no value in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>There is no error more common, or more dangerous, than that an unre&s;trained indulgence of appetite is generally attended with a liberal, humane, and merciful tem|per. Nor is there any opinion more fal&s;e and more fatal, or which demands to be more &s;teadily controverted, than that liber|tini&s;m and good-nature are natural and ne|ce&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;ociates. For after all that cor|rupt poets, and more corrupt philo&s;ophers, have told us of the blandi&s;hments of plea|&s;ure, and of its tendency to &s;often the tem|per, and humanize the affections, it is cer|tain, that nothing hardens the heart like exce&s;&s;ive and unbounded luxury; and he who refu&s;es the &s;weete&s;t gratifications to his own voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, will generally be &s;ound

the lea&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of tenderne&s;s for the wants of others. The cruelties at Rome bore an exact prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rtion to the di&s;&s;olute|ne&s;s at Capreae. And it is not le&s;s notori|ous, that the Imperial fiddler became more barbarous, as he grew more profligate.&mdash;Pro&s;perity, &s;ays the Arabian proverb, fills the heart till it makes it hard: and the mo&s;t dangerous pits and &s;nares for human virtue are tho&s;e, which are &s;o covered over with the flowers of pro&s;perous fortune, that it requires a cautious foot, and a vigilant eye, to e&s;cape them.</P>
<P>Even Ananias and Sapphira were, I doubt not, well e&s;teemed in &s;ociety; for it was enough to e&s;tabli&s;h a very con&s;iderable re|putation to &s;ell even part of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions for religious purpo&s;es: but what an alarm does it &s;ound to hypocri&s;y, that, in&s;tead of be|ing rewarded for what they brought, they were puni&s;hed for what they kept back! And it is to be feared, that this deceitful pair are

not the only one, upon whom a good action, without a pure intention, has drawn down a righteous retribut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&punc;</P>
<P>For though outwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> actions are the &s;u|re&s;t, and to human eyes the only evidences of &s;incerity, yet Chri&s;tianity is a religion of <HI>motives</HI> and <HI>principles.</HI> The Go&s;pel is continually referring to the <HI>heart,</HI> as the &s;ource of good; it is to the poor in <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> to the pure in <HI>heart,</HI> that the divine ble&s;|&s;ing is annexed. A man may correct many improper practices, and refrain from many immoral actions, from merely human mo|tives; but, though this partial amendment is not without its u&s;es, yet this is only at|tacking &s;ymptoms, and neglecting the mor|tal di&s;ea&s;e. But to &s;ubdue a worldly tem|per, to control irregular de&s;ires, and to have a clean heart, is to extingui&s;h the &s;oul, and &s;pirit, and e&s;&s;ence of &s;in. Totally to <HI>ac|compli&s;h</HI> this, is, perhaps, beyond the nar|row limits of human perfection; but to

<HI>attempt</HI> it (with an humble reliance on &s;u|perior aid) is &s;o far from being an extra|vagant or romanti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ght of virtue, that it is but the common duty of every ordinary Chri&s;tian. And this perfection is not the le&s;s real, becau&s;e it is a point which &s;eems con&s;tantly to recede from our approaches. Our highe&s;t attainments, in&s;tead of bringing us "to the mark," only teach us to remove the mark to a greater di&s;tance, by giving us more humbling views of our&s;elves, and more exalted conceptions of the &s;tate which we are labouring after. Though the pro|gre&s;s towards perfection may be perpetual in this world, the actual attainment is re|&s;erved for a better. And this re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire of a happine&s;s which we cannot reach, and this lively idea of a perfection which we can|not attain, are among the many arguments for a future &s;tate, which &s;eem to come lit|tle &s;hort of ab&s;olute demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t remember, that this is not
<PB N="15" REF="021271_0014_0FB2B3F6D36BAA18">
a &s;ermon, but a mere &s;uperficial e&s;&s;ay. I am neither an old man a clergyman, nor a methodi&s;t, &s;o that it is at lea&s;t <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> that I may be neither actuated by moro&s;ene&s;s, &s;elf intere&s;t, nor enthu&s;ia&s;m. I live much in the world, and have as much &s;atisfaction in its lawful plea&s;ures, and permitted in|dulgencies, as other men. I endeavour to cultivate the greate&s;t candour for the opini|ons, and affection for the per&s;ons of all my fellow creatures. I am charmed with hu|manity, genero&s;ity, and integrity, even in worldly men. But one virtue mu&s;t not in|trench upon another. Charity mu&s;t not &s;upplant faith. If a man be generous, good-natured, and humane, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to feel for him the tenderne&s;s of a bro|ther; but if, at the &s;ame time, he be irre|ligious, intemperate, or profane, who &s;hall dare to &s;ay he is in a &s;afe &s;tate?

<P>May I venture to be a little paradoxical; and while &s;o many grave per&s;ons are de&s;|canting on the mi&s;chiefs of vice, may I be permitted to &s;ay a word on the mi&s;chiefs of virtue; or, rather, of that &s;hining coun|terfeit, which while it wants the &s;pecific gra|vity, has much of the brightne&s;s of &s;terling worth? Never, perhaps, did any age pro|duce more beautiful declamations in prai&s;e of virtue than the pre&s;ent; never were more poli&s;hed periods rounded in honour of hu|manity. An ancient Pagan would imagine that A&s;trea had returned to take up her abode in our metropolis; a primitive Chri&s;|tian would conclude, that <Q>righteou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="021271_0016_0FB2B3F9CE543E50">

<P>When the general texture of an irregular life is &s;pangled over with &s;ome con&s;tituti|onal plea&s;ing qualities; when gaiety, good humour, and a thoughtle&s;s profu&s;ion of ex|pence throw a lu&s;tre round the faultie&s;t cha|racters, it is no wonder that common ob|&s;ervers are blinded into admiration: a pro|fu&s;e genero&s;ity dazzles <HI>them</HI> more than all

the duties of the decalogue. But though it may be a very u&s;eful quality towards &s;e|curing the election of a borough, it will contribute but little towards making &s;ure the calling and election to the kingdom of heaven. It is &s;omewhat &s;trange that extra|vagance &s;hould be the great criterion of goodne&s;s with tho&s;e very people who are them&s;elves the victims to this idol; for the prodigal pays no debts if he can help it: and it is notorious, that in one of the wit|tie&s;t and mo&s;t popular comedies which this country has ever produced, tho&s;e very pa&s;|&s;ages which exalt liberality at the expence of ju&s;tice, were nightly applauded with en|thu&s;ia&s;tic rapture by tho&s;e deluded trade&s;|men, whom, perhaps, that very &s;entiment helped to keep out of their money.</P>
<P>But there is another &s;ort of fa&s;hionable character, who&s;e fal&s;e brightne&s;s is &s;till more pernicious, by ca&s;ting a &s;plendour over the mo&s;t de&s;tructive vices. Corrupt manners,

ruinous extravagance, and the mo&s;t fatal pa&s;&s;ion for play are &s;ometimes gilded over with many engaging acts of charity, and a general attention and re&s;pect to the cere|monials of Chri&s;tianity.

<P>It is obvious to all &s;erious per&s;ons, that that branch of the divine law, again&s;t which the better kind of people tre&s;pa&s;s with the lea&s;t &s;cruple, is the fourth commandment. Many who would &s;hudder at the violation of the other nine, &s;eem without ceremony to expunge this from the divine code; but by what authority they do this, has never

<P>People in general are not aware of the mi&s;chief of judging of the rightne&s;s of any action by its pro&s;perity, or of the excel|lence of any in&s;titution by the abu&s;e of it. We mu&s;t never proportion our exertions to our &s;ucce&s;s, but to our duty. If every laudable undertaking were to be dropped becau&s;e it failed in &s;ome ca&s;es, or was a|bu&s;ed in others, there would not be left an

Alms-Hou&s;e, a Charity-School, or an Ho&s;|pital in the land. And if every right prac|tice were to be di&s;continued becau&s;e it had been found not to be &s;ucce&s;sful in every in|&s;tance, this fal&s;e rea&s;oning, pu&s;hed to the extreme, might at la&s;t be brought as an ar|gument for &s;hutting up our churches, and burning our bibles.</P>
<P>But if, on the one hand, there is a proud and arrogant di&s;cretion which ridicules, as Utopian and romantic, every generous pro|ject of the active and the liberal; &s;o there is on the other, a &s;ort of popular bounty which arrogates to it&s;elf the exclu&s;ive name of <HI>feeling,</HI> and rejects with di&s;dain the in|fluence of an higher principle. I am far from intending to depreciate this humane and exqui&s;itely tender &s;entiment, which the beneficent Author of our nature gave us, as a &s;timulus to remove the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others, in order to get rid of our own un|ea&s;ine&s;s. I would only ob&s;erve, that where

not &s;trengthened by &s;uperior motives, it is a ca&s;ual and precarious in&s;trument of good, and cea&s;es to operate, except in the imme|diate pre&s;ence, and within the audible cry of mi&s;ery. This &s;ort of feellng forgets that any calamity exi&s;ts which is out of its own &s;ight; and though it would empty its pur&s;e for &s;uch an occa&s;ional object as rou&s;es tran|&s;ient &s;en&s;ibility, yet it &s;eldom makes any &s;tated provi&s;ion for mi&s;eries, which are not the le&s;s real becau&s;e they do not obtrude upon the &s;ight, and awaken the tenderne&s;s of immediate &s;ympathy. This is a mecha|nical charity, which requires &s;prings and wheels to &s;et it a going; whereas, real Chri&s;tian charity does not wait to be acted upon by impre&s;&s;ions and impul&s;es.</P>
<P>Another cau&s;e which very much intimi|dates well-di&s;po&s;ed people, is their terror, le&s;t the character of piety &s;hould derogate from their reputation as men of &s;en&s;e.&mdash;Every man of the world naturally arrogates
<PB N="49" REF="021271_0048_0FB2B43E0568EB10">
to him&s;elf the &s;uperiority of under&s;tanding over every religious man. He, therefore, who has been accu&s;tomed to &s;et a high va|lue on his intellectual powers, mu&s;t have made very con&s;iderable advances in piety before he can acquire a magnanimous in|difference to this u&s;urped &s;uperiority; be|fore he can &s;ubmit to the par&s;imonious al|lotment of wit and learning, which is a&s;|&s;igned him by the &s;upercilious hand of worldly wi&s;dom.

daily become weaker. That which is long &s;uppre&s;&s;ed is too frequently extingui&s;h|ed. For this rea&s;on, principally, it is to be regretted that religious conver&s;ation &s;hould be &s;o carefully bani&s;hed from polite company. Were it otherwi&s;e, young and ba&s;hful piety, in&s;tead of being afraid to &s;how its head, would be cultivated, che|ri&s;hed, and encouraged. For while we are beings compounded of pa&s;&s;ion as well as intellect, the devotion of the generality is not &s;o purely &s;piritual as not to &s;tand in need of every external and collateral help.

<P>Nothing perhaps more plainly di&s;covers the faint impre&s;&s;ion which religion has real|ly made upon our hearts, than this di&s;in|clination, even of good people, to &s;erious conver&s;ation. Let me not be mi&s;under|&s;tood; I do not mean the wrangle of de|bate;

<P>Another cau&s;e, which &s;till further impedes the reception of religion even among the well-di&s;po&s;ed, is, that garment of &s;adne&s;s in which people delight to &s;uppo&s;e her dre&s;&s;ed; and that life of hard au&s;terity, and pining ab&s;tinence, which they pretend &s;he enjoins her di&s;ciples.

enemies; but, unhappily, it is the too fre|quent mi&s;conception of her injudicious friends. But &s;uch an overcharged picture is not more unamiable than it is unlike; for I will venture to affirm, that Religion, with all her beautiful and becoming &s;anc|tity, impo&s;es fewer &s;acrifices, not only of rational, but of plea&s;urable enjoyment, than the uncontrolled dominion of any one vice. Her &s;ervice is not only perfect &s;afety, but perfect freedom. She is not &s;o tyrannizing as Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o exacting as the World, nor &s;o de&s;potic as Fa&s;hion. Let us try the ca&s;e by a parallel, and examine it, not as affect|ing our virtue, but our plea&s;ure. Does Religion forbid the cheerful enjoyments of life as rigorou&s;ly as Avarice forbids them? Does &s;he require &s;uch &s;acrifices of our ea&s;e as Ambition? or &s;uch renunciations of our quiet as Pride? Does Devotion <HI>murder &s;leep</HI> like Di&s;&s;ipation? Does &s;he de&s;troy Health like Intemperance? Does &s;he annihilate
<PB REF="021271_0056_0FB2B44E40E6E948">
Fortune like Gaming? Does &s;he imbitter Life like Di&s;cord; or abridge it like Duel|ling? Does Religion impo&s;e more vigi|lance than Su&s;picion? or half as many mortifications as Vanity? Vice has her martyrs: and the mo&s;t au&s;tere and &s;elf-de|nying A&s;cetic (who mi&s;takes the genius of Chri&s;tianity almo&s;t as much as her enemies) never tormented him&s;elf with &s;uch cruel and cau&s;ele&s;s &s;everity as that with which Envy lacerates her unhappy votaries.&mdash;Worldly honour obliges us to be at the trouble of re&s;enting injuries; but Religion &s;pares us that inconvenience by command|ing us to forgive them; and by this injunc|tion con&s;ults our happine&s;s no le&s;s than our virtue; for the torment of con&s;tantly hating any one mu&s;t be, at lea&s;t, equal to the &s;in of it.&mdash;If this e&s;timate be fairly made, then is the balance clearly on the &s;ide of Religion even in the article of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>It is an infirmity not uncommon to good

kind of people, to comfort them&s;elves that they live in the exerci&s;e of &s;ome one natural good quality, and to make a religious merit of a con&s;titutional happine&s;s. They have al&s;o a &s;trong propen&s;ity to &s;eparate what God has joined; belief and practice; the creed and the commandments; actions and motives; moral duty and religious obedi|ence. Whereas, you will hardly find, in all the New Te&s;tament, a moral, or a &s;ocial virtue that is not hedged in by &s;ome religi|ous injunction: &s;carcely a good action en|joined towards others, but it is connected to &s;ome exhortation to per&s;onal purity.&mdash;All the charities of benevolence are, in ge|neral, &s;o agreeable to the natural make of the heart, that it is a very tender mercy of God to have made that a duty, which, to finer &s;pirits, would have been irre&s;i&s;tible as an inclination; and to annex the highe&s;t future reward to the greate&s;t pre&s;ent plea|&s;ure. But in order to give a religious &s;anc|tion
<PB N="59" REF="021271_0058_0FB2B450C3D1C880">
to a &s;ocial virtue, the duty of vi&s;iting the fatherle&s;s and widow in their affliction, is in&s;eparably attached to the difficult and &s;elf-denying injunction of keeping our&s;elves un&s;potted from the world. This adjunct is the more needful as many are apt to make a kind of moral commutation, and to allow them&s;elves &s;o much plea&s;ure in ex|change for &s;o much charity. But one good quality can never &s;tand proxy for another. The Chri&s;tian virtues derive their highe&s;t lu&s;tre from a&s;&s;ociation: they have &s;uch a &s;pirit of &s;ociety, that they are weak and imperfect when &s;olitary; their radiance is brightened by communication, and their natural &s;trength multiplied by their alliance with each other.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied that good &s;ort of people &s;ometimes u&s;e religion as the volup|tuous u&s;e phy&s;ic. As the latter employ medicine to make health agree with luxury, the former con&s;ider religion as a medium

to reconcile peace of con&s;cience with a life of plea&s;ure. But no moral chemi&s;try can blend natural contradictions; the world will &s;till be uppermo&s;t, and religion will di&s;dain to coale&s;ce with its antipathy.</P>
<P>Let me not be &s;u&s;pected of intending to in&s;inuate that religion encourages men to fly from &s;ociety, and hide them&s;elves in &s;o|litudes: to renounce the generous and im|portant duties of active life, for the vi&s;ionary, cold, and fruitle&s;s virtues of an Hermitage, or a Cloy&s;ter. No: the mi&s;chief ari&s;es not from our living in the world but from the world living in us; occupying our hearts, and monopolizing our affections. Action is the life of virtue, and the world is the noble&s;t theatre of action. Perhaps &s;ome of the mo&s;t perfect patterns of human conduct may be found in the mo&s;t public &s;tations, and among the bu&s;ie&s;t orders of mankind. It is, in|deed, a &s;cene of trial, but the glory of the triumph is proportioned to the peril of the

conflict. A &s;en&s;e of danger quickens cir|cum&s;pection, and makes virtue more vigi|lant. Lot maintained his integrity in a great city, proverbially wicked, and forfeited it in the bo&s;om of retirement.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that worldly good &s;ort of people are a greater credit to their pro|fe&s;&s;ion, by exhibiting more cheerfulne&s;s, gaiety, and happine&s;s, than are vi&s;ible in &s;erious Chri&s;tians. If this a&s;&s;ertion be true, which I very much &s;u&s;pect, is it not pro|bable that the apparent ea&s;e and gaiety of the former may be derived from the &s;ame &s;ource of con&s;olation which Mrs. Quickly recommends to Fal&s;taff, in Shake&s;peare's admirable picture of the death-bed &s;cene of that witty profligate? <Q>He wi&s;hed for comfort, quoth mine ho&s;te&s;s, and began to talk of God; now I, to comfort him, begged him he &s;hould not think of God: it was time enough to trouble him&s;elf with the&s;e things.</Q> Do not many de|ceive

<P>Another ob&s;truction to the growth of piety, is that unhappy prejudice which even good kind of people too often enter|tain again&s;t tho&s;e who differ from them in opinion. Every man who is &s;incerely in earne&s;t to advance the intere&s;ts of religion, will have acquired &s;uch a degree of candour, as to become indifferent by whom good is done, or who has the reputation of doing it, provided it be actually done. He will be an|xious to increa&s;e the &s;tock of human virtue and happine&s;s, by every po&s;&s;ible means. He will whet and &s;harpen every in&s;trument of goodne&s;s, though it be not ca&s;t in his own mould, or fa&s;hioned after his own pattern.

<P>But though the pa&s;&s;ive and &s;elf-denying virtues are not high in the e&s;teem of good &s;ort of people, yet they are peculiarly the evangelical virtues.

<P>But I am willing to flatter my&s;elf that the moral and intellectual &s;cene about us begins to brighten. I indulge my&s;elf in moments of the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic and de|lightful vi&s;ion; taking encouragement from that glorious prophecy, that <Q>of the in|crea&s;e of his government there &s;hall be no end.</Q> A prediction which &s;eems to be gradually accompli&s;hing: and in no in|&s;tance more, perhaps, than in the noble

For what event can human wi&s;dom fore&s;ee more likely to contribute to <Q>give the SON the Heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</Q> than the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch an enterprize, which will re&s;tore the lu&s;tre of the Chri&s;tian name, too long &s;ullied with oppre&s;&s;ion, cruelty, and inju&s;tice?</P>
<P>A good &s;pirit &s;eems to be at work. A catholic temper is diffu&s;ing it&s;elf among all &s;ects and parties: and enlightened candour, and a liberal toleration were never more prevalent; good men combat each other's opinions with le&s;s rancour, and better man|ners. We have many public encourage|ments; we have a pious king; a wi&s;e and virtuous mini&s;ter; many re&s;pectable, and not a few &s;erious, clergy. (May their num|ber daily increa&s;e!) Among the&s;e &s;ome of the fir&s;t in dignity are the fir&s;t in conduct.

An increa&s;ing de&s;ire to in&s;truct the poor, to inform the ignorant, and to reclaim the vicious, is &s;preading among us. The late Royal Proclamation affords an honourable &s;anction to virtuous endeavours, and lends nerves and &s;inews to the otherwi&s;e feeble exertions of individuals, by inforcing laws wi&s;ely planned, but hitherto feebly execu|ted. In &s;hort, there is a good hope that we &s;hall more and more become that hap|py people who have the Lord for their God: that as pro&s;perity is already within our walls, peace and virtue may abide in our dwel|lings.</P>
<P>But vain will be all endeavours after <HI>par|tial</HI> and <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> amendment. Refor|mation mu&s;t begin with the GREAT, or it will never be effectual. <HI>Their</HI> example is the fountain from whence the vulgar draw their habits, actions, and characters. To expect to reform the poor while the opulent are corrupt, is to throw odours into the

&s;tream while the &s;prings are poi&s;oned.&mdash;Even the excellent in&s;titution of Sunday &s;chools for training religious &s;ervants, will avail but little, if, as &s;oon as the per&s;ons there educated, come into the families of the great, they behold practices diametri|cally oppo&s;ite to the in&s;tructions they have been imbibing. If they fall into the hou&s;es of the profligate, they will hear the doc|trines which they have been taught to reve|rence, derided; if into mere worldly fami|lies, they will &s;ee them neglected; and to the e&s;&s;ential principle of vital Chi&s;tianity, oblivion is &s;carcely le&s;s fatal than contempt.</P>
<P>If, therefore, the rich and great will not, from a liberal &s;pirit of doing right, ab&s;tain from tho&s;e offences, for which the poor are to &s;uffer fines and impri&s;onments, effectual good cannot be done.

But will it not &s;trike every well-meaning Sunday traveller with a ge|nerous remor&s;e, when he reflects that he owes the accommodation of an unob&s;truc|ted road to the very obedience which is paid by others to that divine and human law which he is in the very act of violating?</P>
<P>Will not the common people think it a little inequitable that they are abridged of the diver&s;ions of the public-hou&s;e and the gaming yard on Sunday evening, when they &s;hall hear that many hou&s;es of the fir&s;t nobility are on that evening crowded with company, and &s;uch amu&s;ements carried on as are prohibited by human laws even on common days?

It was not by inflicting pains and pe|nalties that Chri&s;tianity fir&s;t made its way into the world: the divine truths it incul|cated received irre&s;i&s;tible confirmation from the LIVES, PRACTICES, and EXAMPLES, of its venerable profe&s;&s;ors.

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT, TO THE SECOND EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>THE public favour having already brought this little E&s;&s;ay to another edition, the author has been &s;edulous to di&s;cover any particular objections that have been made to it. Since the preceding &s;heets were printed off, it has been &s;ug|ge&s;ted by &s;ome very re&s;pectable per&s;ons who have honoured this &s;light performance with their notice, that it inculcates a too rigid au&s;terity, and carries the point of ob|&s;erving Sunday much too far; that it takes away all the u&s;ual occupations of the day, without &s;ub&s;tituting any others in their &s;tead: and that it only pulls down a wrong &s;y&s;tem, without &s;o much as attempting to build up a right one. The author begs leave to ob&s;erve in his own defence, that
<PB N="76" REF="021271_0075_0FB2B4741ADED478">
in animadverting on error, he purpo&s;ely avoided in&s;i&s;ting on obvious duty. To tell people what they already know to be right was le&s;s the intention of this addre&s;s, than to ob&s;erve upon practices which long ha|bit had prevented them from perceiving to be wrong. Sen&s;ible and well-meaning per&s;ons can hardly be at a lo&s;s on a &s;ub|ject which has exhau&s;ted precept, and wea|ried exhortation. To have expatiated on it, would only have been to repeat what is already known and acknowledged to be right, even by tho&s;e whom the hurry of engagements will not allow to take breath one day in a week, that they may run the race of plea&s;ure with more alacrity on the other &s;ix. But, probably, it is not the duties, but the amu&s;ements appropriated to the day, about which the inquiry is made. It will, perhaps, be found that the intervals of a Sunday, regularly devoted to all its rea&s;onable and obvious duties, are
<PB N="77" REF="021271_0076_0FB2B4758E4EBC28">
not likely to be &s;o very tedious, but that they might be ea&s;ily and plea&s;antly filled up by cheerful, innocent, and in&s;tructive con|ver&s;ation. Human delights would be very circum&s;cribed indeed, if the practices here noticed as erroneous, included the whole circle of enjoyment. Are the plea&s;ures of retirement, the plea&s;ures of friend&s;hip, the plea&s;ures of intellect, and the plea&s;ures of beneficence, to be e&s;timated as nothing?</P>
<P>There will not be found, perhaps, a &s;ingle per&s;on who &s;hall honour the&s;e pages with a peru&s;al, who has not been repeat|edly told, with an air of impo&s;ing gravity, by tho&s;e who produce cards on a Sunday evening, <HI>that it is better to play than to talk &s;candal.</HI> Before this pithy axiom was in|vented, it was not perhaps &s;u&s;pected that Sunday gaming would ever be adduced as an argument in favour of morals. With|out entering into the comparative excel|lence of the&s;e two occupations, or pre&s;u|ming

to determine which has a claim to pre-eminence of piety, one may venture to be thankful that the&s;e alternatives do not &s;eem to empty the whole &s;tock of human re&s;ource.</P>
<P>People in the gay and elegant &s;cenes of life are perpetually complaining that an exten&s;ive acquaintance, and the nece&s;&s;ity of being con&s;tantly engaged in large circles and mixed a&s;&s;emblies, leave them little lei|&s;ure for family enjoyment, &s;elect conver|&s;ation, and dome&s;tic delights. Others, with no le&s;s earne&s;tne&s;s, lament that the hurry of public &s;tations, and the nece&s;&s;ary demands of active life, allow them no time for any but frivolous reading. Now the recurrence of one Sunday in every week, &s;eems to hold out an inviting remedy for both the&s;e evils. The &s;weet and delightful plea&s;ures of family &s;ociety might then be uninterruptedly enjoyed, by the habitual exclu&s;ion of trifling and idle vi&s;itors, who
<PB N="79" REF="021271_0078_0FB2B4795AA015F8">
do not come to &s;ee their friends, but to get rid of them&s;elves. Per&s;ons of fa&s;hion, living in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and connected by the clo&s;e&s;t ties, whom bu&s;ine&s;s and plea|&s;ure keep a&s;under during the greate&s;t part of the week, would then have an oppor|tunity of &s;pending a little time together, and of cultivating that friend&s;hip for each other, and that affection for their children, to which the pre&s;ent manners are not <HI>very</HI> fa|vourable. As to the other &s;et of com|plainers, tho&s;e who can find no time to read; this interval naturally pre&s;ents it&s;elf; and it luckily happens, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t enlightened men the world ever &s;aw have, not unfrequently, devoted their rare talents to &s;ubjects peculiarly &s;uited to this day; and that not merely in the didactic form of &s;ermons, which men of the world affect to di&s;dain; but in every alluring &s;hape which human ingenuity could a&s;&s;ume. It luckily happens, among a thou&s;and o|ther
