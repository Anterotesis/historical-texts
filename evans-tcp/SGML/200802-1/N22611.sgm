<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ub&s;tance of the following pages is chiefly drawn from tho&s;e excellent au|thors, Home, Cullen, and M'Bride; who&s;e names alone are a &s;ufficient recommendation: They were compiled at the reque&s;t of our friend Mr. A&s;bury.</P>
<P>The work contains a good de&s;cription of each di&s;order, and its remote cau&s;es, as far as known The proximate cau&s;e is generally o|mitted, being unintelligible to tho&s;e who are not acquainted with medicine, of little u&s;e, and much di&s;puted by phy&s;icians. The cure is as &s;imple as po&s;&s;ible, &s;o as not to interfere with efficacy: few medicines being recommended, and no compounds where they could be omitted. To this is prefixed the management of the &s;ick, about which the attendants are u&s;ually much at a lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Such medicines as are frequently u&s;ed are put at the end, numbered and referred to, which pre|vents frequent repetition, but tho&s;e that are not &s;o general are in&s;erted in the reading. Will not this be much more agreeable to the reader, than a general reference or a general in&s;ertion?</P>
<P><PB REF="029891_0003_0FE2C3BC3759B168">A few di&s;orders are omitted, becau&s;e they are not proper to this country, or becau&s;e they are unmanageable even in the hands of phy&s;icians, or for other as good rea&s;ons: otherwi&s;e it com|prehends as many di&s;orders as Dr. Cullen has treated on.</P>
<P>It is recommended to the Methodi&s;t Society in particular, by the author, their Friend.</P>

OF FEVERS IN GENERAL.</HEAD>
<P>FEVERS admit of a two-fold di&s;tinction: fir&s;t, with re&s;pect to their duration; as into continued, Remittent and Intermittent Fevers.</P>
<P><HI>Continued fevers</HI> go on to their end, without any very obvious change for better or wor&s;e, in a period of twenty-four hours.</P>
<P><HI>Remittent fevers,</HI> either obviou&s;ly abate at &s;ome pe|riod or periods during twenty-four hours, or are like a number of &s;hort continued fevers linked together, abating once in the cour&s;e of two or three or more days.</P>
<P><HI>Intermittents</HI> go perfectly off every day and return the next, which is called a Quotidian; or every other day, leaving an intermediate well day, called Terti|ans; or every fourth day inclu&s;ive, leaving two well days, called Quartans. In this manner they go and come till they change, or fini&s;h their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;econd di&s;tinction re&s;pects the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem: as Inflammatory, Nervous, and Putrid fevers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.
INFLAMMATORY FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS fever mo&s;t frequently attacks the young in the vigour of their life; &s;uch as are of a ru&s;tic &s;anguine athletic con&s;titution, who indulge them&s;elves in living freely: though &s;ufficient cau&s;es will bring it on in &s;ome degree, in almo&s;t any con&s;titution and way of living. It attacks at all &s;ea&s;ons, but mo&s;t frequent|ly in the &s;pring and beginning of &s;ummer.</P>
<P><HI>Cau&s;es.</HI> Heat and cold alternately, or variou&s;ly ap|plied, fatigue, anger, immoderate u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, watching, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It di&s;covers it&s;elf by a la&s;&s;itude, with a dull &s;en&s;ation of the body, debility, alternating chills and heats, tremors, pains throughout the whole body, but more particularly about the &s;houlders, back, knees and head. The&s;e are &s;ucceeded by an inten&s;e and burning heat, an inextingui&s;hable thir&s;t, inflamed eyes, tumefaction or fulne&s;s of the face, &s;ickne&s;s and vomiting, inquietude, anxiety, full and &s;trong pul&s;e, dry &s;kin, red (though &s;ometimes watery) urine; rough, dry, yellow, or dark coloured tongue, covered with a cru&s;t; difficult breathing, co&s;tivene&s;s, cough, watching, de|lirium, &s;tupor; and if the fever is not checked, a co|ma,
<PB N="7" REF="029891_0006_0FE2C3CDA44E9610">or con&s;tant tendency to &s;leep, tremors, partial convul&s;ions as of the hands, &amp;c. hiccough, involunta|ry di&s;charges of the belly and bladder take place and clo&s;e the &s;cene in death. This is a de&s;cription of it in its mo&s;t violent degree. In the greate&s;t number of ca&s;es, we meet with it far more moderate; a &s;trong pul&s;e, &s;ick &s;tomach and thir&s;t being the chief &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould be confined to his bed, in a cool, dark and &s;ilent room; the cool|ne&s;s to be regulated by the &s;ea&s;on. He &s;hould ab|&s;tain from all kinds of meats and &s;trong drinks. For food; panada, barley, jellies, light un&s;ea&s;oned puddings and pies, may be given in &s;mall quantity. For drink; lemonade, vinegar and water, barley water, herb teas with lemon juice, apple water, tamarind water or jelly and water, may be given largely.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> If the fever be violent, and the patient as de|&s;cribed in the fir&s;t paragraph of the ca&s;e, from half to two thirds of a pint of blood &s;hould be taken away (according to the age and cu&s;toms of the patient) as quick as po&s;&s;ible; which may be repeated the next day in le&s;&s;er quantity, if the fever has not abated. After the fir&s;t bleeding let him take one ounce of Glauber &s;alts, which will frequently exclude the nece&s;&s;ity of another bleeding. After this the bowels &s;hould be opened daily if required, by a common cly&s;ter. if after one bleeding and a do&s;e of &s;alts, the fever does not go off, which it &s;eldom does, let the pati|ent have one of the powders No. 1. every two hours, provided they will remain on his &s;tomach: but if they will not, give the &s;aline mixture No. 2. two table-&s;poon|fuls every two hours; and after this has been given &s;ome time, if the patient's &s;kin become &s;oft and moi&s;t, it &s;hould be continued in, otherwi&s;e lay it a&s;ide and try the powders again. If the&s;e when given for a day or two do not le&s;&s;en the fever, or if they will not re|main, and the &s;aline mixture is ineffectual, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> bleeding has been practi&s;ed as far as prudent; it will then be nece&s;&s;ary to put a bli&s;ter to the back of the
<PB N="8" REF="029891_0007_0FE2C3D41E097FB8">neck, and to &s;oak the patient's feet in lukewarm wa|ter for an hour if he can bear it; after this try the powders, or the mixture again, and they will then have their only chance, and in many ca&s;es will be effectual.</P>
<P>In the &s;lighter ca&s;es of this fever, &s;uch as I have &s;aid, we mo&s;t commonly meet with. If the patient will allow of it, one bleeding will be proper, after which or in &s;uch as will not allow bleeding, give a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ke; two grains of tartar emetic divided into three do&s;es and taken in half an hour, or fifteen grains of ipecacuana, or half a table-&s;poonful of antimonial wine will an&s;wer; after which give the powders or the mix|ture, and open the bowels with a do&s;e of &s;alts. After the fever has gone off, which u&s;ually is attended with a &s;weat, if the patient is much reduced, let him take a tea-&s;poonful of bark in port wine, or in water eve|ry three hours till he has taken an ounce, after which he may take one or two more at longer intervals. He &s;hould u&s;e gentle exerci&s;e in a carriage, and return gradually to his bu&s;ine&s;s and diet.</P>
<P>There is a fever which has the name of &s;ynochus, which in the fir&s;t &s;tage is of the above type, but after a while quickly changes to the putrid, to be hereafter de&s;cribed. In &s;uch a ca&s;e all the management and cure above &s;hould be relinqui&s;hed as &s;oon as the change is ob&s;erved, and the management and cure for the putrid immediately adopted.</P>

NERVOUS FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE of relaxed fibres and weak nervous &s;y&s;tem, are the per&s;ons mo&s;t &s;ubject to this fever.</P>
<P><HI>Cau&s;es.</HI> Exce&s;&s;ive evacuations, repeated &s;alivations, immoderate venery, depre&s;&s;ions of the mind from grief, watching and night &s;tudy, humid &s;tagnant air of &s;ubterraneous apartments, indige&s;tible food, e&s;peci|ally &s;uch as is unfit for nutrition; as of cold watery fruits and vegetables; thin cloathing, rainy &s;ea&s;ons, &s;oft moi&s;t winter, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="029891_0008_0FE2C3D97A2F4380"><HI>Symptoms.</HI> This fever approaches with dejection of mind, lo&s;s of appetite, oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;leeple&s;&s;ne&s;s, in|voluntary groans, repeated &s;ighs, fear, unu&s;ual la&s;&s;itude after motion, and alternate &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of cold and heat.</P>
<P>After &s;ome days a &s;wimming or pain in the head comes on with &s;ick &s;tomach and vomiting of in&s;ipid phlegm, great weakne&s;s, moderate heat, in&s;en&s;ibility to thir&s;t; frequent, weak, and &s;ometimes intermitting pul&s;e; a moi&s;t tongue, &s;ometimes red and at other times covered with a white or yellowi&s;h tough mucus; dry lips, oppre&s;&s;ion about the brea&s;t and difficult breathing, pale watery or whey-like urine: a dull &s;en&s;e of pains about the brea&s;t and head, dozing, deli|rium, redne&s;s and warmth of the face, whil&s;t the feet are c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld; a tendency and di&s;po&s;ition to be ea&s;ily and frequently di&s;turbed by dreams:&mdash;after the&s;e have taken place and continued &s;ome time, they are followed by immoderate &s;weats and wa&s;ting laxes, great dulne&s;s and &s;lothfulne&s;s of the external and internal &s;en&s;es, anxi|ety and fainting. And now nature being exhau&s;ted by the di&s;order, the tongue trembles, the extremities from a coldne&s;s become cold, the nails turn livid, &s;ight and hearing peri&s;h, the delirium turns to a coma, the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lly and bladder are involuntarily evacuated, topi|cal convul&s;ions come on, and death clo&s;es the &s;cene, u&s;ually before the fourteenth day. The &s;ymptoms in|crea&s;e in the evening.&mdash;The delirium is only a mutter|ing continually; quite different from the delirium of the former fever: though in this there is generally a great in&s;en&s;ibility, and towards the end a lo&s;s of &s;ight and hearing, yet at times in the beginning there is a great and preternatural &s;en&s;ibility to light and noi&s;e: &s;ometimes an eruption like millet &s;eed appears without any alteration for better or wor&s;e. A continuance of this fever has brought on temporal idioti&s;m, which vani&s;hed with the debility.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould be confined to his bed in an airy darkened room, and kept a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ably warm or cool, according to the &s;ea&s;on. His room, bed and body clothes, face, hands and feet &s;hould be
<PB N="10" REF="029891_0009_0FE2C3DFDA3F3D00">kept clean. His diet &s;hould be light though nouri&s;h|ing, and given frequently, rather than in large quan|tities at once; it &s;hould be mild: chicken water and broth, or beef tea may be given if the patient de&s;ires it, and the effect proves it to be u&s;eful; but the gene|ral &s;tock of food &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of the various prepara|tions of mild, dige&s;tible, nouri&s;hing vegetables, &s;uf|ficiently well known to every hou&s;e-keeper; tho&s;e &s;hould be &s;uited to the patient's appetite, and chang|ed &s;o as not to pall him with any one. Wine and water may be u&s;ed from the beginning, though then it may only be given to allay the thir&s;t, and &s;hould be made weak: five or &s;ix times a day a cup full may be given, even though the patient do not a&s;k for it; but as the &s;trength fails it &s;hould be made &s;tronger and &s;tronger, and given in as large quantity as a per&s;on in health could take. When the wine has not the effect of increa&s;ing the &s;ymptoms and rendering the pul&s;e too quick, it may be &s;afely continued in.&mdash;Claret is &s;up|po&s;ed to be the be&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> A gentle vomit of 12 grains of ipecacuana in a little water may be given in the beginning, and may be repeated the next day. The bowels &s;hould be opened with thirty grains of rhubarb, and co&s;tive|ne&s;s continually prevented by &s;mall do&s;es of the &s;ame medicine. A bli&s;ter &s;hould be applied to the &s;ide early in the di&s;ea&s;e, and when it has drawn, the water let out, and the part dre&s;&s;ed with a colewort leaf or a little Turner's cerate; after this another may be applied to the other &s;ide, or to the back of the neck, provided no bad &s;ymptoms follow the fir&s;t, if they do, bli&s;ters &s;hould be laid a&s;ide till a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility comes on, when they &s;hould be applied &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, as long as they are attended with advantage. If the patient's &s;kin be dry in the beginning, let him take three o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> four grains of James' powder, in thick &s;yrup three or four times a day, wa&s;hing it down with &s;nake-root tea; yet not &s;o as to &s;weat the patient. If the James' powder is not to be had, one-eighth of a grain of tartar emetic may be u&s;ed in its &s;tead. When the de|bility
<PB N="11" REF="029891_0010_0FE2C3E554400560">increa&s;es, let the patient begin and take two table-&s;poonfuls of the decoction of bark No. 3. every hour or two, putting a little mint water with it, and when the patient has taken this &s;ome time, let him take the bark in &s;ub&s;tance with wine: one tea-&s;poon|ful of bark in two table-&s;poonfuls of old claret every two or three hours: this or No. 4. &s;hould be continu|ed in till the patient perfectly recovers.</P>
<P>When the patient has been much hara&s;&s;ed for want of &s;leep, have his feet bathed at evening in tepid water, and give him ten or fifteen drops of laudanum. This practice may be continued as long as it proves effec|tual in procuring &s;leep. In tho&s;e ca&s;es that proceed from exce&s;&s;ive evacuations there is little hope and &s;carce any thing &s;hould be attempted, but the &s;trengthening plan.</P>
<P>The patient &s;hould carefully &s;hun all the cau&s;es, and u&s;e a generous diet with regular varied exerci&s;e of body and mind, and be &s;paring of his &s;trength.</P>

PUTRID FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who are of a relaxed habit and gloomy di&s;po&s;ition; tho&s;e who have been debilitated by living upon bad victuals, by venery, famine, labour, or lo&s;s of re&s;t, &amp;c. ea&s;ily take this fever (which is cau&s;ed by putrid contagion or noxious air) and diffi|cultly emerge from it.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> An inten&s;e con&s;uming tho' remitting heat, particularly inwards; &s;mall, frequent, and unequal pul&s;e without &s;trength; throbbing of the arteries that run along the neck and temples; great pro&s;tration of &s;trength, heavine&s;s without &s;leep; and when &s;leep does take place, little or no refre&s;hment is gained from it;
<PB N="12" REF="029891_0011_0FE2C3ECD46085B0">an anxious, dejected, and de&s;ponding mind, nau&s;ea, and vomiting of black bile, pain of the head and tem|ples, redne&s;s of the eyes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">out their &s;ockets; du&s;ky countenance, noi&s;e in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> interrupted breath|ing, with &s;ighs and foetid breath; pains about the &s;to|mach, joints and back, difficulty of lying in one po&s;|ture, trembling, delirium. At fir&s;t the tongue is whit|i&s;h but quickly changes blacki&s;h, whil&s;t the lips, teeth and gums are be&s;et with a tough di&s;agreeable mucus; an inextingui&s;hable thir&s;t attends with a bitter mawk|i&s;h ta&s;te, which is communicated to the drink. The urine, on the increa&s;e of the di&s;order, becomes blacki&s;h or red with a &s;ediment: The &s;weats become foetid, the &s;tools lived, black or bloody, and very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tid: and if the fever goes on, a thru&s;t and ulcers attack the mouth and throat; blood is di&s;charged from different parts, a hiccough and other partial convul&s;ions come on, which death &s;carce ever fails to follow.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould have fre&s;h air ad|mitted by keeping the door of his chamber open, if it is not too cold, and by opening his windows if it is &s;ummer time, and the weather clear. Salt petre or vinegar &s;hould be burned upon the hearth in winter, and boughs of trees and flowers thrown about the room in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>His hands, face and feet &s;hould be wa&s;hed daily in vinegar and water, or wine and water; he &s;hould be &s;erved frequently, and &s;hifted in bed and body clothes as frequen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y as can be afforded, if it is daily: in fine, the greate&s;t attention &s;hould be paid to cleanline&s;s.&mdash; His food &s;hould be mo&s;tly of acid vegetables, &s;uch as plea&s;e his appetite and &s;tomach be&s;t. His drink &s;hould be port wine diluted<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this he &s;hould drink more and more of, as he becomes more debilitated, &s;o as to make it his drink and medicine: a quart a-day may be u&s;ed; this he &s;hould continue in for &s;ome time after he has recovered, though in &s;maller do&s;es: A fre&s;h air|ing every day, after recovery, will be highly u&s;eful.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> An emetic of eight grains of ipecacuana and one of tartar emetic, or half a table-&s;poonful of anti|monial
<PB N="13" REF="029891_0012_0FE2C3F173AF4320">wine, &s;hould be given as quick as po&s;&s;ible, be|&s;ide this, twenty-five or thirty grains of rhubarb, or two drachms of cream of tartar, &s;hould be given in a lit|tle jelly, to open the bowels, after which the decoction of bark No. 3. &s;hould be given: two table-&s;poonfuls with a little mint water, every hour; if the &s;tomach bears this well, and the &s;ymptoms of putrefaction and debility increa&s;e, the bark in &s;ub&s;tance &s;hould be u&s;ed: a tea-&s;poonful in lemon juice and mint water every hour. But if the &s;tomach does not bear the bark, or if the heat and fever be con&s;iderable, apply a bli&s;ter to the brea&s;t, and give a do&s;e of the &s;aline mixture or one of the following pills between the times of taking the bark, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Camphor beat to an impalpable powder, with com|mon &s;pirits, twenty-four grains, powdered &s;eneca root as much; make them up with &s;yrup.</P>
<P>If the &s;tomach &s;till refu&s;es the bark in the above ways, try it in triple quantities in cly&s;ters, or try the vinous tincture, No. 4. The bark is the only chance, we are therefore to per&s;i&s;t in its u&s;e till a cure is made. Three drops of oil of vitriol in a gla&s;s of water every hour, may be tryed where the delicacy of the &s;tomach or fever, will not admit any preparation of bark; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as it is apt to gripe, it &s;hould never be u&s;ed when the bowels are affected.</P>
<P>Cly&s;ters of &s;alt, &s;ugar, and decoction of bitter herbs are to be u&s;ed to keep the bowels regular, or &s;ome of the gentle purges mentioned above; but it will be of|ten be&s;t to u&s;e fir&s;t one and then the other, according to circum&s;tances. In ca&s;e this fever &s;hould be of a re|mittent form, the remi&s;&s;ions &s;hould be greatly attend|ed to, and a double quantity of bark given if po&s;&s;ible. Sometimes a lax with di&s;ten&s;ion of the belly comes on after a while, in &s;uch a ca&s;e the belly &s;hould be foment|ed with bitter herbs, boiled and applied warm, and one grain of ipecacuana, with five drops of laudanum, given every two hours.</P>
<P>Sometimes &s;pots break out in this fever, then it has been termed the Spotted Fever; at other times there is a yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin, then it is termed the

REMITTENT FEVER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Expo&s;ure to the &s;un for hours together, or the effects of a cool evening, and other &s;imilar cau&s;es after fatigue or &s;ummer heat. Thus there is no difference in the real cau&s;es of this fever and intermit|tents, except in the degree and mode of their appli|cation.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> Alternating cold and heat, followed by a continued heat and a fever: Sometimes a delirium comes on at the fir&s;t attack.</P>
<P>The patient is di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with thir&s;t and vomiting, u&s;ually of bile; pain of the head, back and joints; the region of the &s;tomach &s;wells, and becomes painful; the tongue is white and moi&s;t, and the patient is harra&s;&s;ed with &s;leeple&s;&s;ne&s;s; the &s;kin and eyes are of a yellow ca&s;t; the pul&s;e is &s;ometimes a little hard, and &s;eldom full; the bowels are &s;ometimes bound, &s;ometimes loo&s;e: with the&s;e &s;ymptoms the fever u&s;ually proceeds, for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 days, at one of which times, after a little &s;weat it remits, and the patient becomes evidently better. After a few hours have elap&s;ed, com|monly in the evening, the acce&s;&s;ion comes on, &s;ometimes with, at other times without a chill, and &s;o goes on as
<PB N="15" REF="029891_0014_0FE2C3FF03D6AE68">before: In this manner, that is, by acce&s;&s;ions and re|mi&s;&s;ions, the fever goes on to its final period.</P>
<P>A copious &s;weat or di&s;charge of blood from the no&s;e, or an univer&s;al yellowne&s;s, commonly attend the conclu&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>After the fever has gone off, a great lightne&s;s of the head attends, &s;o that the patient can &s;carce walk; rheu|matic pains, and drop&s;ical &s;wellings &s;ometimes follow.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould be kept cool and airy; he &s;hould have plenty of acid drinks, as lemon|ade, jelly, tamarind water, and for food, he &s;hould have toa&s;ted bread moi&s;tened with a little tea, baked fruits, rice, &s;ago, barley, &amp;c. but the&s;e, though proper, will &s;eldom have a place, as the patient can &s;carce ever con|tain on his &s;tomach what his little appetite inclines him to take: but the toa&s;t has often been found to &s;tay, when nothing el&s;e would.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> If the vomiting be con&s;iderable, a little ca|momile tea may be given to promote it a moment or two, that a remi&s;&s;ion may be procured to give the &s;a|line mixture No. 2. one table-&s;poonful every hour. When this &s;its on the &s;tomach pretty well, ten drops of antimonial wine and a little mint water may be ad|ded to each do&s;e, and the medicine continued: but if the vomiting is only &s;light, the be&s;t way to procure a remi&s;&s;ion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ymptoms will be to give an emetic, one tea-&s;poonful of antimonial wine, may be given eve|ry ten minutes until it operates, or 12 grains of ipe|cacuana may be given at once, after which the mix|ture may be given in the manner directed with antimo|nial wine.</P>
<P>If the vomiting re&s;i&s;ts every thing given, or if a re|mi&s;&s;ion does not take place in a few days, bli&s;ters &s;hould be u&s;ed; on the brea&s;t in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, on the back of the neck in the la&s;t. Sometimes a bundle of mint &s;tew|ed in wine, and applied to the brea&s;t, has been found u&s;eful in checking the vomiting, therefore it may be tried before a bli&s;ter.</P>
<P>Co&s;tivene&s;s &s;hould be regularly obviated by taking a tea-&s;poonful or more of cream of tartar, or by u&s;ing
<PB N="16" REF="029891_0015_0FE2C405B13FC5D8">the common cly&s;ters of &s;alts, &s;ugar and milk occa|&s;ionally.</P>
<P>When the patient has &s;uffered for want of &s;leep, af|ter giving a cly&s;ter, and bathing the feet in lukewarm water for half an hour, ten or fifteen drops of lauda|num may be given in a do&s;e of the &s;aline mixture No. 2. and this &s;hould be done after noon before the in|crea&s;e of the fever, for it u&s;ually makes &s;ome increa&s;e towards night.</P>
<P>When the fever remits, the decoction of bark &s;hould be given, two table-&s;poonfuls every hour, and if the acce&s;&s;ion is po&s;tponed by it, the bark in &s;ub&s;tance &s;hould be given, as long as the acce&s;&s;ion is ab&s;ent: in &s;ome ca&s;es it will put it off altogether; then, as well as when the fever cea&s;es, the bark &s;hould be given in large quantities, until the patient recovers his &s;trength.</P>
<P>When a lax attends, four grains of rhubarb and one of ipecacuana with two drops of laudanum, may be given every three or four hours in&s;tead of the &s;aline mixture.</P>
<P>When great &s;weats attend in the end, it may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to add five drops of elixir of vitriol to each or every other do&s;e of bark: in ca&s;e a headach follows, apply a &s;mall bli&s;ter behind the ear, and repeat it if nece&s;&s;ary. The patient &s;hould be very careful in avoid|ing the cau&s;es of this fever, or he will experience a relap&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.
INTERMITTENT FEVER (COMMONLY) FEVER AND AGUE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSE.</HI> The relaxing heat of &s;ummer, e&s;pecially when accompanied with moi&s;ture and bad air of mar&s;hy places, will &s;o relax the &s;urface and expo&s;e the extreme ve&s;&s;els to the air, that nothing more than the u&s;ual effect of common air is nece&s;&s;ary to bring on the fever; at other times, when the predi&s;po&s;ition is not &s;o great, a cool air will produce it.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="029891_0016_0FE2C40B0DF4B930"><HI>Symptoms.</HI> A languor with yawning and &s;tretching, coldne&s;s, &s;ick &s;tomach, rigors and tremors, u&s;ually at|tend the commencement; the cold with &s;hivering con|tinues in a very con&s;iderable degree, for one, two or three hours, when it begins to give way, fir&s;t to flu&s;hes, and then to a continual burning heat and fever, with a full pul&s;e and thir&s;t. Pain of the head and frequently of the joints, attended &s;ometimes with delirium. Af|ter this has continued for &s;ome time, a &s;weat breaks out, which becomes profu&s;e, and this is &s;ucceeded by an intermi&s;&s;ion of a part, a whole, or two days, ac|cording to the type. See page 5. In the intermi&s;|&s;ion, the patient is affected with &s;carce any thing but debility. The fever returns again in the end of the time mentioned, with the &s;ame &s;ymptoms, and &s;o goes on to its end, unle&s;s it changes its form. Quotidians come on in the morning, and u&s;ually attack the deli|cate and irritable. Tertians come on about noon, and u&s;ually attack the more robu&s;t and vigorous. Quar|tans come on in the afternoon, and mo&s;t commonly attack the aged and torpid.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> Sometimes the ague &s;o reduces the patient, that it will be nece&s;&s;ary to keep him warm and give a little wine; but this is &s;eldom the ca&s;e. In common nothing is nece&s;&s;ary but to lie down. In time of the fever, lemonade and other acid drinks, or warm teas may be u&s;ed; the former will be mo&s;t grateful.</P>
<P>In the intermi&s;&s;ions, port wine and water, and a &s;trengthening ea&s;y dige&s;ted diet will be proper.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> In the beginning of the cold &s;tage, if the patient is able to puke, he &s;hould take one; three grains of tartar emetic in a gill of water, may be taken in the cour&s;e of forty minutes, if required to take all: or 15 grains of ipecacuana in a &s;poonful of water, or a tea-&s;poonful of antimonial wine every fif|teen minutes: either of the&s;e may be u&s;ed; the tartar is the mo&s;t active and effectual, but acts too rough with &s;ome. When this has been taken, and the fever
<PB N="18" REF="029891_0017_0FE2C412ACC5A3B0">has come on, a &s;weating &s;hould be encouraged by tak|ing about three pints of warm drink in the cour&s;e of two hours, to which one hundred drops of antimonial wine may be added, to make it more effectual. In ca&s;e the patient cannot take a puke, let him take an Ander&s;on's pill to open his bowels before the time of the ague, and when the fever has come on, and con|tinued a while, let him take fifteen drops of laudanum and fifteen of antimonial wine, in a cup of warm tea every half hour, for three times.</P>
<P>But when nothing forbids a puke but the per&s;on's inclination, he may take ju&s;t before the fit, or after it is over &s;ome time, the following powder; twenty grains of rhubarb, and five of calomel in a little &s;yrup, and when the fever comes on, take the warm drink as above.</P>
<P>The&s;e medicines will prepare for the exhibition of bark, which &s;hould be given immediately after the &s;weat goes off. Any of the preparations may be given, but the powder is the be&s;t; it may be given in mint water, milk or wine; one tea-&s;poonful every hour, till the ague comes on again; then it &s;hould be laid a&s;ide till this is over, when it is to be given again; the pa|tient &s;hould not cea&s;e under an ounce and an half, or two ounces. If, when this has been taken, the ague does not cea&s;e, another puke &s;hould be u&s;ed as before In all ca&s;es the bowels &s;hould be kept open by Ander|&s;on's pills or rhubarb.</P>
<P>Sometimes twenty drops of laudanum given before the ague, will put it off, and &s;ometimes giving it ju&s;t be|fore the patient is expected to &s;weat, will prepare for the bark; &s;ometimes a quantity of &s;nake-root tea at the &s;ame time will prove effectual: and in many ca&s;es bit|ters, of horehound, dogwood, rue, &amp;c. will do as well as bark.</P>
<P>The fever and ague, after it has continued for &s;ome time, is apt to a&s;&s;ociate cu&s;tom with its cau&s;es of re|currence; and thus it will frequently continue through &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons as it would not have begun in. In &s;uch ca&s;es as the&s;e almo&s;t any alteration in the &s;y&s;tem will le&s;&s;en or remove it; thus keeping the patient under
<PB N="19" REF="029891_0018_0FE2C417628AAE90">expectation; fear or joy have often removed it; and thus the impo&s;itions of old women have often been effectual, when the faith of her patient has rou&s;ed his expectation and fixed his attention. Though &s;uch things may at times be allowed, yet I would caution every prudent per&s;on to keep his &s;kin to him&s;elf, and not let ignorant quacks fill up their lack of knowledge upon him, with the virulence of an ar&s;enical pla&s;ter, or a more dangerous bolus.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.
HECTIC FEVER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Violent racks of the con&s;titution from any cau&s;e, ab&s;orption of matter from ulcers, exce&s;|&s;ive relaxation, and delicacy of any part that is ex|po&s;ed to irritation, as the lungs, &s;tomach and bowels; all the&s;e cau&s;es are attended with general debility, and particular relaxation of the parts that defend the ten|der extreme ve&s;&s;els, from the irritations which act about them.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> The fever u&s;ually comes on in the fore|noon, &s;ometimes with con&s;iderable chills or coldne&s;s, which la&s;t &s;ome time; this is &s;ucceeded by heat, a quick, &s;mall and weak pul&s;e in general, though &s;ome|times there is &s;ome hardne&s;s in it, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e who are not much reduced, and early in the complaint; this &s;ometimes le&s;&s;ens towards evening, and again in|crea&s;es at night; at other times it continues on with|out any very obvious change till towards morning, when it intermits or greatly remits with a profu&s;e &s;wet which la&s;ts a con&s;iderable time; the &s;weats do not appear in the fir&s;t &s;tage, that is, in profu&s;ion. A headach u&s;ually attends the fever, as al&s;o a &s;ick &s;to|mach, both of which grow better in the intermi&s;&s;ion or remi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The tongue is u&s;ually clean in this fever, the belly at fir&s;t is often bound, but in the end a lax almo&s;t al|ways
<PB N="20" REF="029891_0019_0FE2A1B09D978408">attends. The patient wa&s;tes away gradually, his feet &s;well, particularly at night, his hair falls off, his nails become crooked and thick, his face &s;harp, and a general failing takes place in every thing but his ex|pectations of getting better, and his under&s;tanding, which u&s;ually remain to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>This is the mo&s;t u&s;ual form, but there is &s;ome variety, owing to the variety of the parts affected, and the &s;tate of the patient.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould have the lighte&s;t and mo&s;t nouri&s;hing food given him in &s;mall quantities at a time, and at &s;uch times chiefly as the fever is ab|&s;ent or &s;light, thus his breakfa&s;t or dinner at ten o'clock, &s;hould contain mo&s;t of what he &s;hould eat. Milk is very proper when the &s;tomach will receive it: &s;ometimes it may be mo&s;t agreeable when diluted with water and &s;weetened, at other times it may &s;it better when boiled. Cu&s;tards, light puddings, chicken wa|ter and broth, beef tea, rye mu&s;h, corn mu&s;h, with the common vegetables of the grain kind, are mo&s;tly proper. Weak wine and water in the ab&s;ence of fe|ver; barley water and &s;age tea at other times, will be proper for drink. The patient &s;hould be kept clean, and when his &s;trength admits, he &s;hould be aired in a chair, and at all times have acce&s;s to pure air.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> In many ca&s;es it will be needle&s;s to attempt any thing but a removal of the cau&s;e, when the fever will quickly cea&s;e: but in general both the one and the other are to be combated. For treating the cau&s;es I re|fer to the places where they are treated of (though &s;ome of them could not have a place in this book, as they belong to &s;urgery) for the treatment of the fever alone, the debility &s;hould be removed and the fever in|terrupted: for the fir&s;t, when nothing forbids, bitters and bark are nece&s;&s;ary; al&s;o elixir of vitriol, which may be given to &s;ixty drops a day. The&s;e are to be ta|ken whil&s;t the fever is off, or when it has greatly re|mitted, ju&s;t before the time when the return is expect|ed, and again after it has commenced, one of the fol|lowing powders may be given: ipecacuana two grains,
<PB N="21" REF="029891_0020_0FE2C424E5A90D60">magne&s;ia one tea-&s;poonful, mix them and give it in a little camomile tea. When a lax comes on there is little hope, but the following may be given: colum|bo root one drachm, pour one gill of boiling water upon it, and in a quarter of an hour &s;train it off; to this twenty drops of laudanum may be added; this may be u&s;ed in the cour&s;e of eight hours, and repeated.&mdash; Rice will now be the be&s;t food.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.
INFLAMMATION OF THE EYE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> The&s;e act either externally or internally, though frequently both take place in producing the affection.</P>
<P>The externals are, violence, du&s;t, cold winds, changes from heat to cold, viewing minute objects or bright bodies; metallic fumes, great heat, e&s;pecially when accompanied with moi&s;ture; night reading, &amp;c. The internal cau&s;es are, checked excretions, as the men&s;es, &amp;c. repul&s;ion of &s;ome eruptive di&s;orders, long continued ulcers dried up, immoderate u&s;e of &s;piritu|ous liquors and &s;pices, fevers, mea&s;les, &s;crophula, venereal di&s;ea&s;e, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> Redne&s;s, &s;welling, &s;tiffne&s;s and pain of the ball of the eye or the lids; both from an inflam|mation of the ve&s;&s;els that pa&s;s over and through them, being filled with too much blood, or with red blood, in&s;tead of the fine white parts of it.</P>
<P>When the inflammation is con&s;iderable, a fever at|tends; and in &s;uch ca&s;es there is danger of the effects, unle&s;s &s;peedily prevented by curing the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> In no ca&s;e a cure can be hoped for unle&s;s the cau&s;es be removed, which in many ca&s;es will be followed with an immediate cure. In any bo|dy be lodged in the eye, it is to be extracted, and if another di&s;ea&s;e be the cau&s;e, it mu&s;t be cured by the means directed for &s;uch di&s;ea&s;e. In every ca&s;e the patient &s;hould avoid exerci&s;ing his eyes any more than
<PB N="22" REF="029891_0021_0FE2C42BEB303A88">what there is nece&s;&s;ity for:&mdash;He &s;hould confine him|&s;elf to a dark room, or apply a fold of green &s;ilk over his eyes, and u&s;e an umbrella in the &s;ummer. His food &s;hould be light and mo&s;tly vegetable, in all ca&s;es without pepper or mu&s;tard. His drink &s;hould be cooling and acid, without any mixture of &s;pirit. His room &s;hould be cooled with &s;prinkling in the &s;ummer time.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> If there be a fever, or if the inflammation be con&s;iderable, and the patient able to bear bleeding, he &s;hould lo&s;e half a pint of blood, which may be re|peated if nece&s;&s;ary; this &s;hould be followed by a do&s;e of &s;alts, or if the patient's ca&s;e does not require bleed|ing, or other circum&s;tances prevent it, the &s;alts then &s;hould be the fir&s;t thing. All this is to be done after the cau&s;e is removed, and thus in many ca&s;es where removing the cau&s;e will be the chief means of cure, they will have no place; as where the inflammation pro|ceeds from the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, &s;crophula, &amp;c. One of the fever powders No. 1. when the fever continues, or the inflammation remains ob&s;tinate, given every four hours, will be &s;erviceable. The belly &s;hould be kept regular by cream of tartar or &s;mall do&s;es of &s;alts, or of jalap and nitre: as jalap fifteen grains, nitre twenty-five, mix them.&mdash;For external applications, a bli&s;ter behind the ears is mo&s;t effectual, and to the eyes the following: &s;ugar of lead twelve grains to half a pint of water, or as much white vitriol to an equal quantity of water: to either of which, when the inflammation has continued, and the former re|medies have been u&s;ed, may be added a table-&s;poon|ful of brandy.</P>
<P>The&s;e external applications (the bli&s;ter excepted) will be proper in every ca&s;e and time. The weak|ne&s;s that follows requires that the patient u&s;e either a general or topical cold bath, and avoid much ap|plication and expo&s;ure.</P>

<P>Exerci&s;ing the parts that &s;uffer, as in &s;inging, and loud &s;peaking; acrids, mechanic bodies, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed evacuations, or artificial evacuations, that have been long u&s;ed, neglected.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> This complaint u&s;ually appears with red|ne&s;s and &s;welling of the glands &s;ituated on each &s;ide of the palate; one is u&s;ually mo&s;t &s;welled in the beginning, and as this declines, the other increa&s;es; a pain that &s;hoots towards the ear attends, with feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms, and a &s;trong, full, quick pul&s;e: The patient feels a di&s;agreeable clammine&s;s, and the tumour is u&s;ually tip|ped with whiti&s;h mucus.</P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es the external parts are much &s;welled; &s;ometimes &s;carce any tumour is to be perceived by look|ing into the mouth, and at the &s;ame time the difficul|ty of &s;wallowing and pain may be very con&s;iderable: In the wor&s;t ca&s;es the breathing becomes very diffi|cult, the tumours clo&s;ing up the pa&s;&s;age almo&s;t entire|ly; then the patient &s;its with his mouth open, his drink regurgitates through his no&s;trils, and he is ready to &s;trangle every minute for want of a free re&s;piration, which is totally impeded when the patient dies.</P>
<P>What is u&s;ually termed a &s;ore throat, is a le&s;&s;er de|gree of this &s;ame affection, therefore the &s;ame reme|dies may be u&s;ed, omitting the mo&s;t general and pow|erful one of bleeding.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould be kept neither hot nor cold: he &s;hould have a light vegetable diet of a fluid preparation; his drink &s;hould be of the acid kind, and not cold or warm, but ju&s;t aired. His head &s;hould be kept up in bed, or he may &s;it up altogether;
<PB N="26" REF="029891_0025_0FE2C4454A8EF508">&s;peaking, and every exertion of the throat, &s;hould be avoided, and the cau&s;es &s;hould be removed.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> The patient &s;hould be bled pretty freely, and this may be repeated the next day if nece&s;&s;ary: he &s;hould take a do&s;e of &s;alts as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and then a bli&s;|ter &s;hould be applied under the throat, of a &s;lim form, &s;o that it may reach from ear to ear: the bowels &s;hould be regularly kept open: before the tumour has become very con&s;iderable, fifteen grains of ipecacuana will be of great &s;ervice. In &s;uch patients as do not allow of bleeding, this may be the fir&s;t medicine.</P>
<P>Warm water and vinegar &s;hould be in&s;pired from a proper machine for the purpo&s;e, or from a funnel put over a wooden bowl of water and vinegar, the mouth &s;hould be frequently gargled with a&s;tringent wa&s;hes, as &s;age tea and vinegar; or alum-vinegar and honey, or decoction of oak bark and &s;alt petre. Scarifications with a lancet are nece&s;&s;ary where there is danger of choaking; and likewi&s;e to let out the matter, when the tumours have &s;uppurated.</P>
<P>If the patient is liable to frequent returns of this af|fection, I would advi&s;e him to u&s;e the cold bath daily; at any rate to wa&s;h his neck, and habituate him&s;elf to wear nothing but a very thin &s;tock or ribband, in&s;tead of a large neckcloth.</P>

PUTRID SORE THROAT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;order has for its <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> &s;pecific contagion, and therefore attacks all ages and con&s;titutions.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It begins with chills, which are follow|ed by an inten&s;e and burning heat, a &s;wimming and pain of the head, a trouble&s;ome &s;en&s;ation in the throat, &s;ickne&s;s and vomiting, loo&s;ene&s;s, inflamed and watery eyes, tumid and flu&s;hed face, with a &s;tiffne&s;s of the neck, a &s;mall, frequent and irregular pul&s;e, foetid breath and a di&s;agreeable ta&s;te. Very &s;oon, white &s;pots appear on the glands each &s;ide of the palate, and
<PB N="27" REF="029891_0026_0FE2C449E709BE70">the&s;e with the palate appear red, &s;woln and glo&s;&s;y: the&s;e &s;pots &s;pread and unite, covering almo&s;t all of the mouth with thick &s;loughs, which falling off, leave ul|cers in their places: the redne&s;s and tumour are &s;ome|times extended to the internal parts of the no&s;e.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd day, or later, efflore&s;cences appear on the &s;kin, which are &s;ometimes in &s;uch &s;mall emi|nences as &s;carcely to be &s;een, but more u&s;ually &s;pread in red patches, &s;o as to cover the whole &s;kin; begin|ning fir&s;t about the face and neck, and &s;o extending to the extremities, which feel &s;tiff and &s;welled; this u&s;u|ally continues about four days, and then goes off with a peeling of the &s;kin. The glands about the neck are &s;ometimes &s;welled to an alarming degree. As the complaint advances, di&s;charges of blood from different parts are frequent, and &s;ometimes a gangrene takes place at the beginning of the windpipe or of the oe&s;o|phagus, the channel which leads to the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>The patient's voice is hoar&s;e and flat, though his &s;wallowing is not u&s;ually much impeded; with the&s;e &s;ymptoms it runs on from two to &s;even or more days, increa&s;ing every evening.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> For food, drinks, and general manage|ment, the &s;ame may be u&s;ed as directed for the putrid fever, only a le&s;s degree of cold will be requi&s;ite in this.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> Ten grains of ipecacuana &s;hould be given early in the complaint; three grains of calomel in a little honey, may be given once or twice the evenings after the puke, and if the fir&s;t do&s;e produces more than two &s;tools, it &s;hould be checked by giving ten drops of Laudanum. This medicine will often prove very efficacious, without producing any di&s;charge. Some of the preparations of bark, or the powder, which is be&s;t, &s;hould be given every two hours after the puke, and to the end of the complaint. The throat &s;hould be frequently wa&s;hed with the following: one hundred drops of elixir of vitriol or twenty drops of oil of vitriol to half a pint of water, and one &s;poon|ful of honey. Spring water coloured with indigo has been found u&s;eful as a gargle. Port wine &s;hould be
<PB N="28" REF="029891_0027_0FE2C4503B7C7C30">given to a pint, or quart a day, with the bark. If the tumour in the in&s;ide of the throat be con&s;iderable, a bli&s;ter &s;hould be laid on the out&s;ide.</P>
<P>For the &s;welling of the legs which &s;ometimes follows, the patient may u&s;e eight drops of elixir of vitriol with each do&s;e of bark, four times a day.</P>

CROUP OR HIVES.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Foregoing di&s;orders, as the mea&s;les and the hooping cough: cold moi&s;t air from the water.</P>
<P>It mo&s;t frequently happens to &s;uch as live in &s;eaport towns; and to children, from the time they are wean|ed to their twelfth year.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It &s;ometimes comes on with the &s;ymp|toms of a common cold only; but the peculiar &s;ymp|toms are a hoar&s;ene&s;s, and ringing &s;ound of the voice; at the &s;ame time there is an unea&s;ine&s;s, or pain in the throat, and a whizzing noi&s;e in breathing, as if the pa&s;&s;age was too much &s;traitened for the air; the patient has a cough that is either dry, or accompanied with the di&s;charge of flakes of phlegm, like a membrane; the pul&s;e is quickened, and an unea&s;y &s;en&s;e of heat at|tends. By looking into the throat, a redne&s;s and flakes of phlegm like tho&s;e di&s;charged, may &s;ometimes be perceived. It has happened that the patient has been taken off without &s;carce any complaining, in three, four, or five days.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould not be kept cold, nor di&s;agreeably warm, he &s;hould have a &s;pare thin ve|getable diet, with light acid, or bitter drinks, as teas of various herbs. In time of coughing, he &s;hould be rai&s;ed and a&s;&s;i&s;ted, to keep him from &s;trangling.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> The patient &s;hould take a puke as quick as po&s;&s;ible. (If he is twelve years old, ten grains of ipe|cacuana, and half a grain of tartar emetic will not be too much, for there is a great degree of in&s;en&s;ibi|lity in the &s;tomach in this complaint; if he is only
<PB N="29" REF="029891_0028_0FE2C456F5B9A598">four years old, let him have half as much, or one tea-&s;poonful of antimonial wine, to be repeated every quarter of an hour, till it operates.) After taking the puke, he &s;hould take four grains (if twelve years) of calomel, and ten of jalap, the evening of the &s;ame day; after this for three or four days, he &s;hould take one day the puke, and the next the purge; after the fir&s;t puke and purge, a bli&s;ter &s;hould be laid on the back of the neck. Throughout the complaint, the &s;teams of warm vinegar, or of water in which there is a large lump of lime &s;lacking (which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;olvent) may be drawn into the throat; warm teas, and &s;oaking the feet, may be u&s;ed to re&s;tore the per|&s;piration to the &s;urface.</P>

THE MUMPS.</HEAD>
<P>CONTAGION is the cau&s;e of this complaint.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It makes its appearance with the u&s;ual febrile &s;ymptoms, of chills &s;ucceeding heat, and quickened pul&s;e; this is &s;hortly followed by a &s;welling, at the corner of the lower jaw, of a movea|ble glandular nature; in a little time it diffu&s;es it&s;elf over the whole neck; &s;ometimes both &s;ides are affect|ed. It continues increa&s;ing till about the fourth day, and then declines with the fever. As the &s;welling re|cedes, &s;ome tumour is apt to take place in the te&s;tes of males, and in the brea&s;ts of women. Sometimes when this has not taken place, or when it has been re|pelled by imprudent applications, the fever has conti|nued, or increa&s;ed with delirium.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould be kept upon a low vegetable diet, and not expo&s;e him&s;elf to cold. The above in general will be &s;ufficient, but when the cir|cum&s;tance mentioned takes place, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to direct &s;omething more than the above for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> We &s;hould apply warm &s;tewed bitter herbs, or warm bread and milk poultices to the parts; and if

Be&s;ides this or the&s;e, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ap|ply a bli&s;ter to the back of the neck. In &s;lighter ca&s;es the puke and fomentations will be &s;ufficient.

PLEURISY OR INFLAMMATION OF THE INTERNAL PARTS OF THE BREAST.</HEAD>
<P>THE end of winter, &s;pring and beginning of &s;um|mer are the u&s;ual times that this di&s;ea&s;e is pre|valent; all ages and mo&s;t con&s;titutions are liable to it, but the phlethoric, and tho&s;e of a ru&s;tic con&s;titution, who have &s;een twenty years, and not exceeded &s;ixty, are mo&s;t liable.</P>
<P><HI>Cau&s;es.</HI> Cold and heat applied alternately, or un|equally, &s;training or injuring of the parts, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It u&s;ually begins with chills, which are followed by heat, quick, &s;trong and full pul&s;e, head-ach, difficult breathing, dry cough at the beginning, though &s;ometimes it begins moi&s;t: towards the end, or after it has continued, it is always moi&s;t, and &s;ome|times a very con&s;iderable quantity of yellow mucus is di&s;charged: this is not unfrequently &s;treaked with blood. Mo&s;t frequently, a pungent pain attacks the &s;ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> about the middle of the &s;ixth or &s;eventh rib, but if the pain &s;hould attack any other part of the che&s;t, and &s;hould not be &s;o violent, yet accompanied with the other &s;ymptoms, particularly the full, &s;trong and quick pul&s;e, we are to con&s;ider the complaint as the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> This &s;hould be identically the &s;ame with what is directed in Chap. II. only with addition of mucilaginous and &s;yrup drinks to allay the cough; as
<PB N="31" REF="029891_0030_0FE2C46256A881B0">of flax&s;eed, and mallow tea with honey: a little lemon juice will make it very agreeable.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> From half to two thirds of a pint, or more of blood, &s;hould be taken away on the fir&s;t appearance, and if the &s;ymptoms continue, it may be repeated in eight hours. After the fir&s;t bleeding, a do&s;e of &s;alts &s;hould be given, and &s;mall do&s;es of the &s;ame, or common cly&s;ters may be given regularly to prevent co&s;tivene&s;s. Immedi|ately after the patient's fir&s;t bleeding, a bli&s;ter &s;hould be applied as near as po&s;&s;ible to the pained part, and one of the fever powders, No. 1. given every hour, be|ginning after the operation of the &s;alts is over. If after the bli&s;ter has drawn, the pul&s;e continues up, and the pain has not con&s;iderably abated, the &s;econd bleeding &s;hould be immediately made, and if in half an hour af|ter that, the pain does not give way, a &s;econd bli&s;ter &s;hould be applied on a fre&s;h part, or on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. The powders &s;hould be continued every two hours. But in general, one bleeding, a bli&s;ter, the powders, and keeping an open belly, will be &s;ufficient. Nothing but a relaxation of the pain and fever, &s;hould induce the patient to omit any of the above remedies, for life and death are pretty certainly fixed to the narrow compa&s;s of a few days. If the pul&s;e is &s;trong, and bleeding has been omitted as long as &s;ix or &s;even days, it would be then better done than let alone; but if the pul&s;e flags, and the patient has had a frequent &s;hivering about the la&s;t days, it will then be better, if not the very &s;afety, of the patient, to forbear. At &s;uch a time a bli&s;ter might be applied without any injury, but if a &s;uppuration has taken place, it will be of no &s;ervice; however tho&s;e who are not proper judges, had better make the application, le&s;t there might have been an in&s;ufficient inflammation for to &s;uppurate in that time; and with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the pati|ent may u&s;e what will be proper in the la&s;t ca&s;e of every pleuri&s;y when the cough is trouble&s;ome: a tea-&s;poonful of paregoric in a little flax&s;eed, or other tea, once in four or five hours. In the latter &s;tages, it may be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the patient's &s;trength with decoc|tions of bark, and a light nouri&s;hing diet.</P>

BASTARD OR SPURIOUS PLEURISY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS u&s;ually attacks the aged, tho&s;e of a phleg|matic full habit, who have injured their con&s;titu|tions by exce&s;s of drinking, particularly, and are liable to the vici&s;&s;itudes of the weather, from being much expo&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Cau&s;e.</HI> The long application of cold, &s;uddenly &s;ucceeded by heat, and heating drinks; this, with the predi&s;po&s;ition laid down above, is the chief, if not the only cau&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It makes its appearance with chills and flu&s;hes, which are followed by a &s;light fever, with a &s;oft, not very frequent pul&s;e. The heat of the patient is not u&s;ually much increa&s;ed; a pain affects the &s;ide, or brea&s;t, which is not very pungent, but rather dull and extending; a violent pain in the head, &s;ick &s;tomach and &s;ometimes vomiting, are more or le&s;s pre&s;ent. From the beginning, it is common for a cough, &s;trait|ened breathing, and &s;pitting of tough mucus to attend. An ery&s;ipelatous redne&s;s often appears on the cheeks, and a loo&s;ene&s;s attends the advanced &s;tage of the di&s;|ea&s;e. The patient is apt to be heavy and drow&s;y; thus though there be a pain in the &s;ide, and a fever, it is ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from a true inflammatory af|fection of the brea&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould be kept tolerably warm, his diet &s;hould be light and nouri&s;hing, and in the beginning, if the feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms are not con&s;i|derable, he may have weak wine and water for his drink; in the end it will always be proper, for the
<PB N="33" REF="029891_0032_0FE2C46F7730DC48">patient frequently becomes fainty, and is not able to take any thing be&s;ides. Lemonade may be u&s;ed, when wine and water cannot be given for the fever; and when lemons cannot be got, vinegar and water, or cyder and water.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> Bleeding though it may &s;ometimes be pro|per, as when the patient is of a more robu&s;t habit, and better con&s;titution than what is de&s;cribed above, and when he has been accu&s;tomed to bleeding, and withal the pul&s;e and pain are not low; yet, it &s;hould be u&s;ed &s;paringly and cautiou&s;ly, otherwi&s;e, in ninety ca&s;es out of one hundred, it would be injurious. In the beginning it will be proper to give ten or twelve grains of ipecacuana; or a tea-&s;poonful of antimonial wine, every fifteen minutes until it operates; a bli&s;ter may be put on at the &s;ame time, as near as po&s;&s;ible to the pain; the puke may be repeated once or twice if nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;ometimes it will be nece&s;&s;ary to lay on another bli&s;ter clo&s;e by the former; twenty grains of jalap, or thirty grains of rheubarb, or a table-&s;poonful of ca&s;tor oil, or four or five grains of calomel, may be u&s;ed to remove any co&s;tivene&s;s that is pre&s;ent: this &s;hould be attended to throughout.</P>
<P>For the cough, two drachms of gum ammoniac, di&s;|&s;olved by trituration in a mortar, with half a pint of water, may be given; one table-&s;poonful every hour: or an ounce of &s;yrup (commonly called oxymel) of &s;quills, in as much water, may be given in the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>Seneca &s;nake root or pleuri&s;y root tea may be u&s;ed, if they cannot be procured; to either of the&s;e me|dicines at night a dozen drops of laudanum may be added, in order to allay the cough, that the patient may re&s;t; and if the cough is very frequent in the day, a few drops may be taken every now and then.</P>
<P>Towards the end when the patient grows weak, he &s;hould u&s;e about &s;ixty drops of elixir or vitriol a-day, and u&s;e a decoction of bark or &s;ome good bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></P>

<P>Expo&s;ure to cold, more particularly after heat and damp cloudy weather are the cau&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It begins with a lancinating pain, mo&s;t frequently about the ribs of one &s;ide; this remits a while, and then returns again, &s;o as almo&s;t to make the patient &s;cream out. After a while it becomes fixed, and does not abate, though it is apt to extend, and even to change its place, &s;o that the mu&s;cles of the brea&s;t are frequently attacked, and there are pains in o|ther parts that point out a rheumatic affection: with the above a fever, &s;ometimes pretty &s;mart, at other times le&s;s, attends. In mo&s;t ca&s;es the pul&s;e is not &s;trong, but ea&s;ily &s;topped by pre&s;&s;ing it, to what it is in true pleuri&s;y. Frequently a cough attends, which is apt to increa&s;e towards the end of the other &s;ymptoms, at which time it is accompanied with &s;pitting of yellow, tough mucus; &s;ome degee of co&s;tivene&s;s u&s;ually at|tends, and mo&s;t of the &s;ymptoms are wor&s;e at night.</P>
<P>The breathing is not in general affected &s;o much as in pleuri&s;y, little or no cough attends; the head is u&s;u|ally much affected with pain, and as the pain of the &s;ide declines, the knees or back are &s;ometimes attacked, if not before.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould be kept on a vegetable, moderate diet.</P>
<P>His drink may be warm herb teas.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="029891_0034_0FE2C47A799F09A0"><HI>Cure.</HI> If the patient be pretty full of blood, and his pul&s;e tolerably &s;trong, it will then be prudent and u&s;eful to take away half a pint or more of blood. A bli&s;ter &s;hould be laid over the part, a do&s;e of ca&s;tor oil, or of fifteen grains of jalap and as much cream of tartar, &s;hould be given to open his bowels: if the pain continues, &s;ome proper &s;weating medicine &s;hould be given, as four grains of camphor beat up with honey into a bolus, to which two grains of ipecacuana may be added, this much &s;hould be taken every three or four hours, wa&s;hing it down with &s;eneca &s;nake root tea, or warm baum tea: or in the place of the&s;e a tea-&s;poon|ful of paregoric and twenty drops of antimonial wine, may be taken every three hours; u&s;ing plenty of warm tea in the intervals.

<P><HI>Cure.</HI> If any thing that is acrid, or that may in|jure the &s;tomach mechanically, has been taken in, it &s;hould be evacuated as quick as po&s;&s;ible, by taking plenty of warm water, and applying a feather to the throat, to induce immediate vomiting; but if the vo|miting is already con&s;iderable, it &s;hould not be &s;olicit|ed after vomiting; if the cau&s;e be &s;ome acrid, it &s;hould be diluted with mucilaginous drinks, as gum arabic di&s;&s;olved in water; or oils may be given, as &s;weet oil or almonds oil; at the &s;ame time it &s;hould be counter-acted by a proper medicine. Thus if it be vitriol, or &s;pirit of &s;alt or aqua fortis, let the patient take a table-&s;poonful of &s;alt of tartar, or if he can get none of that, let him get a piece of chalk and eat it. If it be ar&s;e|nic, two tea-&s;poonfuls of precipitate &s;ulphur may be &s;wallowed. After this, or where the&s;e have not been required from the nature of the cau&s;e, the patient &s;hould lo&s;e a pint of blood, and in ca&s;e the pain con|tinues, and the pul&s;e does not &s;ink and intermit, half as much more may be taken away in eight hours following; a bli&s;ter after the fir&s;t bleeding &s;hould be applied to the left &s;ide, and cly&s;ters of oil, &s;ugar, milk, and a little &s;alt petre &s;hould be injected every three hours: four grains of &s;ugar of lead in a little water may be given every two hours the fir&s;t day: nothing but the medicine mentioned &s;hould be applied by the mouth.</P>

ACUTE RHEUMATISM.</HEAD>
<P>THIS attacks at all &s;ea&s;ons, but rarely at any other time than the &s;pring and fall, when the vici&s;&s;itudes of weather are great.</P>
<P><HI>Cau&s;es.</HI> Cold applied to the body, when unu&s;ually warm, or cold applied partially to the body.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> A pain affects &s;ome of the joints, and &s;ometimes the mu&s;cles, &s;o as to extend from one joint to another. Sometimes almo&s;t every joint in the body is affected, and then the complaint comes on with chills, and fever, with a &s;trong pul&s;e, for the mo&s;t part full. In &s;ome ca&s;es, the fever precedes the pains, at other times, it is the contrary; the joints affected become red and &s;welled: the fever and pains u&s;ually increa&s;e at night. If the general affection continues long the patient's &s;en&s;es become &s;omewhat impaired for a while.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould be kept cool, ex|cept when under the operation of &s;weating medicine, then he &s;hould lie between blankets; he &s;hould be kept from all but light vegetable food, and cool acid or warm herb drinks, which may be given plentifully; and when the complaint has gone off, he &s;hould wear flannels till warm weather returns, and then u&s;e bathing.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> The patient &s;hould be in&s;tantly bled, as free|ly as his habit and age will bear, and his complaint demands; this may be repeated in &s;maller quantities, for once or twice in the cour&s;e of four days, if nece&s;|&s;ary. After the fir&s;t bleeding, a do&s;e of &s;alts &s;hould be given, and when that has done operating, one of the powders, No. 1. &s;hould be given, every two ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">.

CHRONIC RHEUMATISM.</HEAD>
<P>THE former di&s;ea&s;e is apt to terminate in this; e&s;pecially when the patient is advanced in years: Cold is the common cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> A pain of &s;ome of the joints, or about the junction of the bones, with a &s;tiffne&s;s of the part. No redne&s;s or &s;welling like that from inflammation affects the part, though after a long continuance, an enlargement of the joints is apt to take place. Lit|tle or no fever attends here, heat le&s;&s;ens the pain, and cold increa&s;es it; quite contrary to what takes place in the preceding complaint. When the pains fix about the &s;mall of the back, the affection is termed a Lumbago; when about the hip, in which ca&s;e the patient becomes &s;omewhat lame, a Sciatica.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The part affected, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;hould be con&s;tantly wrapt in flannel, the patient &s;hould u&s;e wine with any food he may chu&s;e, which will agree with his &s;tomach.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> Ninety drops of volatile tincture of guaiacum, &s;hould be taken in a little water, four times a-day; if this does not an&s;wer, the following pills may be u&s;ed till they produce &s;ome effect; twelve grains of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and twelve grains of opium, to be made into one do|zen

<P>The external remedies in rheumati&s;m, are &s;pirits of camphor, &s;pirits of hart&s;horn and oil; oil and &s;pirits of turpentine, electricity applied by in&s;olation, and drawing &s;parks; the fle&s;h bru&s;h, cold water da&s;hed on.

TOOTH ACH.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> A general cold, cold air applied to the cheeks in an unu&s;ual and &s;udden manner, acrids, &s;weets, or acids applied to the teeth, the acrid matter of a rotten tooth, extraordinary violence, as in break|ing hard &s;ub&s;tances, blows, &amp;c. Be&s;ides the&s;e there are certain di&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es, under which the u&s;ual ex|po&s;ure we are con&s;tantly liable to, is a &s;ufficient cau&s;e; as a nerve being laid bare, by rotting or extraction of a tooth, pregnancy, hy&s;teric di&s;po&s;itions, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> The&s;e are various in different circum|&s;tances. In the tooth ach that proceeds from com|mon cold, there are frequently &s;ymptoms of a rheu|matic affection of the adjacent parts, the pain extend|ing from the tooth to the face, and along up to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">empl, with a throbbing of the arteries, and redne&s;s, &s;ometimes a little &s;welling of the face, and withal a feveri&s;hne&s;s.

<P><PB N="43" REF="029891_0042_0FE2C4AD369FA480"><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould carefully avoid every cau&s;e, and confine him&s;elf to his room. In the ca&s;e of rheumatic &s;ymptoms, his food and drink &s;hould be of the weake&s;t and lighte&s;t kind, and a &s;ilk handkerchief &s;hould be applied over his face. In the other ca&s;es, the face &s;hould be wrapped in flannel, and no change made in the food or drink. The tooth &s;hould be &s;topped with lint.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> In the fir&s;t ca&s;e it will be the be&s;t way to aim at the removal of the cold, by giving a do&s;e of &s;alts, and taking a &s;weat of weak whey, with a tea|&s;poonful of &s;alt petre. After this a &s;mall bli&s;ter applied to the part will be mo&s;t effectual; or, in&s;tead of this, &s;weating the part with hot herbs, or a hot &s;tone, wrapt in moi&s;t or dry rags, may be u&s;eful. In general, in &s;uch a ca&s;e it will be of little u&s;e to apply any thing to the tooth it&s;elf, till the above has been fir&s;t done, then a little laudanum and &s;pirits may be held in the mouth. In all the other ca&s;es, topical applications are more effectual. The chief of the&s;e are opium, camphor, oil of cloves and other warm e&s;&s;ential oils; with the&s;e electricity, burning the tooth, applying a hot iron to the ear, and many other means, have been at times ef|fectual. But it is often nece&s;&s;ary with the&s;e to give &s;mall do&s;es of laudanum, and apply a bli&s;ter, and when the&s;e fail, extracting the tooth; which may be done at any time, by a careful tru&s;ty operator: but if this does not relieve, the pain pa&s;&s;ing to another tooth, the pa|tient &s;hould not in&s;i&s;t upon that being drawn, but commit all to patience. The be&s;t manner of applying topicals is to in&s;ert the medicine into the hollow, and cover it with lint or wax.</P>

THE GOUT.</HEAD>
<P>THE cau&s;es of the gout, for better comprehending them, may be placed under four heads.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The prime cau&s;es; which are the u&s;e of exce&s;&s;ive quantities of high &s;ea&s;oned animal food, and the libe|ral u&s;e of wine and other &s;pirituous liquors. The&s;e are &s;uppo&s;ed to produce their effect, by cau&s;ing an ac|tion in the extreme ve&s;&s;els (which are employed in nu|trition) in degree and con&s;tancy, above what they were con&s;tructed to bear, &s;o that as &s;oon as the body cea&s;es to yield, which is at the end of growth, the ve&s;&s;els from being over excited, are overcome, and &s;uffer an indirect debility, and relaxation.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es; under which a le&s;s de|gree of the above brings on the complaint, becau&s;e they aim at the &s;ame point: they are, indolence, hereditary delicacy of the parts that &s;uffer in the gout (from a general &s;imilarity to the parent) and that tendency in the animal oeconomy which produces a robu&s;t and gro&s;s habit. The&s;e cau&s;es would, when they had proceeded to a certain extent, bring on the gout; but it is &s;el|dom the ca&s;e, that it is not helped on by what may be called.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The exciting cau&s;es; as venery, debauchery, cold applied to the feet, indige&s;tion, much application of mind, night watching, pa&s;&s;ions, exce&s;&s;ive evacua|tions, changing of habits, debilitating di&s;ea&s;es, brui&s;es or &s;trains of the parts that &s;uffer in gout; the u&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and acid fruits, &amp;c. All the&s;e act by debilitating generally or topically, and this being always accompa|nied with a relaxation, expo&s;es the injured parts to the irritation of the air in an uncommon manner. The irritation of the air brings about</P>
<P N="4">4th. The proximate or immediate cau&s;e; which is a &s;uperabundant afflux of the nervous, or vital princi|ple, to the parts mo&s;t debilitated or mo&s;t expo&s;ed (to
<PB N="45" REF="029891_0044_0FE2C4B933B5BF48">the common irritations); u&s;ually the extremity of the joints, or ball of the great toe. This afflux of vital principle has two effects. 1&s;t. As there is no &s;en|&s;ation without the pre&s;ence of this principle, &s;o in the abundance of it, the &s;en&s;ation is exqui&s;ite. 2dly. As there is no circulation without it, and the circulation is in proportion to it, &s;o, in the abundance of it, the circulation is increa&s;ed to inflammation, and the tender parts are forced, and filled fa&s;ter than they can propel the blood; hence conge&s;tion, redne&s;s and pain of the joint, and in &s;uch parts as are not plentifully furni&s;hed with ve&s;&s;els, the mu&s;cular fibres are contracted to a &s;pa&s;m.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="symptoms">
<HEAD>THE SYMPTOMS OF THE REGULAR GOUT.</HEAD>
<P>A CEASING of the &s;weat to which the feet have been accu&s;tomed, an unu&s;ual coldne&s;s of the legs and feet, a frequent numbne&s;s, alternating with a prick|ling &s;en&s;ation all along the cour&s;e of the extremities, frequent cramps of the legs, and a &s;welling of the veins. Whil&s;t the&s;e &s;ymptoms take place in the parts mentioned, the whole body is affected with a degree of torpor and languor: the functions of the &s;tomach in particular are more or le&s;s di&s;turbed, the appetite is dimini&s;hed, and flatulency with other &s;ymptoms of in|dige&s;tion felt. The&s;e &s;ymptoms take place for &s;ome days before the fit of the gout comes on, but often on the day preceding the fit the appetite becomes great|er than u&s;ual: The fit u&s;ually begins about three o' clock in the morning, with pain affecting one foot, mo&s;t commonly at the ball of the great toe, but &s;ome|times in other parts of the foot; with the coming on of the pain there is u&s;ually more or le&s;s of a cold &s;hivering, which as the pain increa&s;es gradually gives way to beat and fever, which la&s;ts as long as the pain does. From the fir&s;t attack the pain becomes more violent till the next midnight, after which it gradually remits, and after continuing about twenty-four hours u&s;ually cea&s;es, with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ating and &s;leep.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="029891_0045_0FE2C4C0F275BD68">The next morning after the remi&s;&s;ion, a &s;welling and redne&s;s is to be perceived in the part affected, which after continuing &s;ome days, gradually abates.</P>
<P>But though the pain cea&s;es at the end of twenty-four hours, it u&s;ually returns every evening, with le&s;s and le&s;s violence and fever, and again abates in the morn|ing: this recurring continues &s;ome days, and then goes off very entirely, till the third, &s;econd, or next &s;pring, following. This is the ca&s;e in the fir&s;t attack of the gout; but the returns become more frequent, till at length after &s;ome years the patient is never clear of it, except a month or &s;o in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on: Af|ter the gout has continued, the pain does not remain in one joint, but &s;hifts about until it has attacked al|mo&s;t every joint in the body.</P>
<P>After a fit is over, the patient feels him&s;elf recruited in body and mind.</P>
<P>As the gout proceeds, the pains become le&s;s &s;evere and more continued, and the other affections are more con&s;iderable, &s;o that the &s;tomach is very much affected with &s;ickne&s;s.</P>

<P>AT this time very little can be done to advantage. If the patient is vigorous, and the inflammation and pain con&s;iderable, blood-letting may be once perform|ed, though &s;paringly. Scarce any thing &s;olid &s;hould be taken for diet, and when the patient has &s;uffered much from want of re&s;t, fifteen drops of laudanum in one tea-&s;poonful of &s;pirits of nitre dulcified, may be taken at night. Applying poultices of bread and milk to the parts, will &s;ometimes give ea&s;e to a &s;mall extent, and in a violent ca&s;e may be tried; carded wool &s;hould always be applied.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE ATONIC GOUT, OR GOUT OF THE STOMACH.</HEAD>
<P>IN &s;uch patients as have brought the gout on them|&s;elves, this peculiarity &s;eldom happens till late in the di&s;order, when the &s;y&s;tem is generally debilitated, and there is little di&s;po&s;ition to inflammation. In &s;uch a &s;tate the &s;tomach is u&s;ually much debilitated, and lia|ble to be acted upon by a &s;lighter cau&s;e than what would bring on an affection of a joint.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="029891_0047_0FE2C4CD9E43C1C8">From the above circum&s;tances of debility, general and topical as well as from the &s;tomach being defend|ed from the application of the common air (which produces the re-action, or inflammation in the regular gout) it happens that the gout of the &s;tomach is a ve|ry different affection from the regular gout; being a ca&s;e of deficient and irregular action of the part, in|&s;tead of an inflammation and exce&s;&s;ive action as in the regular; and hence requiring very different remedies.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> Lo&s;s of appetite, indige&s;tion, flatulen|cy, nau&s;ea and vomiting, acid eructations, pains and cramps in different parts, which yield upon the di&s;|charge of wind; co&s;tivene&s;s, though &s;ometimes loo&s;e|ne&s;s, colic pains and hypochondriac &s;ymptoms (which con&s;i&s;ts in a great attention to the &s;lighte&s;t &s;ymptoms, and an apprehen&s;ion of danger) an ab&s;ence of inflam|matory affections of the joints, and of fever.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient's food &s;hould be a mix|ture of animal and vegetable, of the mo&s;t nutrient and dige&s;tible kind, taken rather at many times than in large quantities. Wine and water, or &s;pirit and wa|ter &s;hould be his drink: It will be of great advantage to keep clo&s;e to the bed, except when the patient is able, and the weather good, then he &s;hould ride in a carriage daily.</P>
<P><HI>Treatment.</HI> Fifteen grains of ru&s;t of &s;teel, with as much pounded orange-peel, may be taken with mint water, or a little &s;pirit of lavender, four or five times a-day.</P>
<P>A tea-&s;poonful of &s;aline aromatic &s;pirit will al&s;o be of &s;ervice to take a few times a-day.</P>
<P>If indige&s;tion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> much, fourteen grains of ipe|cacuana may be given every five or &s;ix days, or large draughts of &s;trong camomile tea, which will frequently have the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>A third variety of the gout is, when the inflamma|tion has appeared fir&s;t in its u&s;ual place (the joints) but from improper treatment, bad management, expo|&s;ure, and other le&s;s ob&s;ervable cau&s;es, it leaves the joints, and fixes upon the &s;tomach or &s;ome other part.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="029891_0048_0FE2C4D25916DA00">This is called the RETROCEDENT GOUT. When the &s;tomach receives the affection, a great anxiety, &s;ick|ne&s;s and vomiting attend; if the lungs, an a&s;thmatic affection is the product; if the heart, fainting; if the head, an apoplexy.</P>
<P>When the &s;tomach or bowels are attacked, wine, with &s;pices boiled in it, &s;hould be given plentifully, or if this is not &s;ufficient, &s;pirits with &s;pices in large do&s;es. In &s;lighter ca&s;es, le&s;s do&s;es of &s;pirits, in which garlic has been &s;teeped, may be given; with this the pa|tient's feet may be &s;teeped in a &s;trong hot mixture of &s;pirits and water, and bli&s;ters laid on the ankles; vola|tile aromatic &s;pirits, and a&s;&s;afoetida, are al&s;o proper to be given, but they are le&s;s powerful than &s;pirits and &s;pices. When the vomiting is trouble&s;ome, it may be encouraged with camomile tea, and afterwards re&s;train|ed by twenty or thirty drops of laudanum with a drachm, of &s;pirits of nitre dulcified; vitriolic aether and mu&s;k are &s;ometimes u&s;eful.</P>
<P>When any of the other parts are affected, a bli&s;ter &s;hould be immediately applied, and the bath of &s;pirits and water applied to the feet. If the patient is able to bear bleeding, it &s;hould be performed when the head or lungs are affected. In all ca&s;es a gentle de|termination to the &s;urface &s;hould be aimed at, by giving one tea-&s;poonful of &s;aline aromatic &s;pirits every two hours; or &s;pirits of nitre dulcified and laudanum every two or three hours. The fourth and la&s;t variety of the gout is the MISPLACED. That is, when the pa|tient, in&s;tead of a regular affection, is immediately (without any preceding affection of the joints) affect|ed with an inflammation of the lungs, the bladder, or the lower end of the la&s;t gut; in this la&s;t it brings on the piles: when it affects the bladder, it brings on &s;trangury or a difficult di&s;charge of urine. The&s;e af|fections are to be treated as directed in the chapters for them; remembering the con&s;titution and &s;ituation of the patient.</P>
<P>During every &s;pecies, co&s;tivene&s;s &s;hould be removed by three or four grains of aloes, or twenty-five of
<PB N="50" REF="029891_0049_0FE2C4DC3AD79D28">rhubarb. And between every affection, the &s;y&s;tem may be &s;trengthened by the following medicine; half a wine-gla&s;s full of which may be taken twice a day, at eleven and at four o'clock; port wine, one quart, ru&s;ty iron or iron flakes, one handful, cinnamon one ounce: let them remain one week and then u&s;e them.</P>
<P><HI>Ob&s;ervations.</HI> 1&s;t, It appears, that a primary gout is the con&s;equence of a general injury done to the &s;y&s;|tem; but that the &s;tomach and extremities &s;uffer chief|ly, becau&s;e the &s;tomach is particularly injured by the prime cau&s;es, and the extremities are more expo&s;ed (from their di&s;tance from the heart and other cau&s;es) to the irritation of the air, which far exceeds common notice and opinion.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, It is al&s;o plain, that tho&s;e who are much pre|di&s;po&s;ed to the gout by hereditary con&s;titution of the parts, cannot po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape it; becau&s;e that quanti|ty of food which is nece&s;&s;ary for nutrition, will pro|duce an action, that the ve&s;&s;els u&s;ually injured in the gout cannot &s;upport through life.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, A fit of the gout is a change in the &s;y&s;tem, which aims at a removal of the injury; only being unbounded and exce&s;&s;ive, not produced by any inter|nal con&s;cientious power, but by phy&s;ical laws.</P>

THE SMALL POX.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;mall pox is of two kinds; the di&s;tinct and the confluent: As they demand a very different treatment, I &s;hall not confound them, but treat of them &s;eparately.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE DISTINCT SMALL POX.</HEAD>
<P>THE cau&s;e of this is a &s;pecific contagion.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> About eight days after inoculation, and probably the &s;ame time after taking it the natural
<PB N="51" REF="029891_0050_0FE2C4E0DCB49648">way, a fever appears of the continued inflammatory kind: after this has continued about three days, a di&s;tinct eruption of &s;mall pimples, like flea-bites, ap|pear on the face; the&s;e increa&s;e and extend, &s;o that about the end of the fifth day, the eruption is com|pleted and extended to the extremities: from the fir&s;t eruption the fever u&s;ually declines, and at the fini&s;hing of the eruption it cea&s;es. During the fever, children are frequently affected with &s;tarting, and if kept warm, with fits.</P>
<P>About the eighth day after the eruption, the&s;e pim|ples have increa&s;ed to &s;pheroidal pu&s;tules, filled with matter, with a red margin around each.</P>
<P>Before the pu&s;tules are quite filled, a &s;welling of the face takes place, which &s;ub&s;ides as &s;oon as the pu&s;tules are filled: a &s;welling of the wri&s;ts and feet &s;ucceeds the above, ju&s;t in the progre&s;&s;ion of the eruption; during this period a &s;ore throat is common.</P>
<P>After the pu&s;tules are fully ripe and yellow, they then either pour out the matter, from a &s;mall rupture at their top, or the matter is ab&s;orbed, leaving en emp|ty flat bag: the former is u&s;ually the ca&s;e with tho&s;e on the face; the latter with tho&s;e on the arms and thighs: in this way they decline till they are perfect|ly dried up, which takes place, from eight to &s;ixteen days (from the time they begin to decline) according to &s;ize and number of the pu&s;tules: pits are fre|quently left behind.</P>
<P><HI>Management</HI> The patient &s;hould be kept cool, both by going into the air, and thinning his cloathing: However, the cu&s;tom of expo&s;ing to bad weather; ex|treme cold, and pulling off from children the flannels which they have been long u&s;ed to, has occa&s;ioned the wor&s;t con&s;equences: a medium therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to ob|&s;erved. Tho&s;e who are in a good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of health &s;hould live chiefly on vegetables, what meat they do u&s;e, &s;hould by all means be fre&s;h; but tho&s;e who are weakly &s;hould not alter their food, &s;o as to weaken them&s;elves, but only choo&s;e &s;uch as they always &s;hould, viz. dige&s;table mild food. This &s;hould be the ma|nagement
<PB N="52" REF="029891_0051_0FE2C4E8A2C1E360">until the fever commences, when they &s;hould u&s;e nothing but light &s;poon aliments, &s;uch as barley, gruel, panada, cu&s;tard, jelly, &amp;c. Spirituous drinks &s;hould be altogether avoided; at the time of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch drinks as the following may be taken more or le&s;s, in proportion to the height of the fever, viz. lemonade, cream of tartar di&s;&s;olved in water, and &s;weet|ened, jelly and water, apple-tea, made by pouring boiling water on undre&s;&s;ed, red-&s;treaked apples, &s;liced very thin; the drink to be &s;weetened; the&s;e drinks, ab&s;tinence, and vegetable food, with the directions for keeping the patient cool, may be ob&s;erved until the number of pocks and favour of the di&s;ea&s;e be deter|mined, after which they may be gradually relinqui&s;h|ed; the expo&s;ure fir&s;t, and then the others, and the proper habits returned to.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t week in May is probably the be&s;t time for inoculation, in the States of Penn&s;ylvania, Delaware and Maryland; farther Southward, April; farther Northward, the latter end of May: but avaricious aims have been the cau&s;e of adopting an earlier &s;ea&s;on. It is upon the whole, in large towns, &s;afe&s;t to inocu|late before teething, but only becau&s;e of the danger of taking it the natural way; where that is not to be feared, then from the fifth to the twelfth year, is far preferable; if any thing be ami&s;s, we can then &s;tand &s;ome chance of rectifying it, by &s;uitable treatment, but with infants we can only deplore their &s;tate, when the com|plaint takes an unfavourable turn.</P>
<P><HI>Treatment.</HI> To tho&s;e who are pretty hearty, or of a full habit, between the time of inoculation and fever, two do&s;es of Glauber &s;alts, or cream of tartar, &s;uffi|cient to procure four or five &s;tools and not more, may be given: but to tho&s;e who are lean or weakly, no purgatives &s;hould be given, only co&s;tivene&s;s &s;hould be removed by a little cream of tartar, or the pills No. 6. If they have not a pa&s;&s;age every day, this will be nece&s;&s;ary; or if they have a pa&s;&s;age every day, and the &s;tools &s;hould be hard and difficultly pa&s;&s;ed, the pills, or a cly&s;ter of oil, &s;ugar, milk and a little
<PB N="53" REF="029891_0052_0FE2C4ED477312F0">&s;craped Ca&s;tile &s;oap, which is probably the be&s;t, is to be given.</P>
<P>If at the commencement of the fever, the patient feels much oppre&s;&s;ion at the &s;tomach, unea&s;ine&s;s and giddine&s;s, it will be proper to admini&s;ter an emetic of two grains of tartar emetic, di&s;&s;olved in a cup of warm water, or of ten grains of ipecacuana; at the &s;ame time he &s;hould have fre&s;h air: when the fever has com|menced, if it runs high, it will be proper to give a do&s;e of &s;alts, which may be taken at two or three por|tions: If this does not le&s;&s;en the fever, take four grains of tartar emetic, and put them into a quart of apple or other tea; three table-&s;poonfuls of this to be given every hour, till the eruption appears, keeping him cool withal. If the eruption appears numerous, and the pul&s;e be u&s;ually &s;trong, a do&s;e of &s;alts will be of u&s;e, as it will bring many of the pimples to nothing; after this nothing more will be nece&s;&s;ary, but to keep the bowels regular with &s;mall do&s;es of any mild medi|cine.</P>
<P>When the pocks have dried away, if any &s;ore or un|dulatory motion of the mu&s;cles take place, a few pills of the following form may be given: calomel twelve grains, opium three grains, honey enough to form them into twelve pills, one of which may be taken night and morning.</P>
<P>If the arm inflames much, pour cold water on it daily, for ten minutes together.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONFLUENT SMALL POX.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SYMPTOMS.</HI> In this the fever is more violent than in the former, the pul&s;e being quicker and more contracted; a di&s;po&s;ition to coma, or a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ep drow&s;i|ne&s;s, is almo&s;t always pre&s;ent with the incipient fever, and a delirium is a frequent &s;ymptom: infants are fre|quently attacked with fits in the fir&s;t days; vomiting is here a common &s;ymptom: early in the third day,
<PB N="54" REF="029891_0053_0FE2C4F585DEB750">the pimples break out in clu&s;ters, and the&s;e are fre|quently preceded or accompanied with an efflore&s;cence like St. Anthony's fire.</P>
<P>When the eruption is completed, it is found to be much more numerous in the face than on the body: the pocks are le&s;s eminent: at the end of the eruption the fever does not go off, but only remits, to increa&s;e with more violence, when the pocks have acquired their &s;ummit; this is called the &s;econdary fever: The pimples &s;oon turn to ve&s;icles filled with whiti&s;h or brown water, in&s;tead of yellow matter, as in the di&s;tinct: the pocks are very irregular, and run into one another in many places<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o as to form one large flat pock, cover|ing almo&s;t the whole face; wherever there is any &s;pace between them, it is not florid, but pale and &s;hrivelled.</P>
<P>The &s;welling of the face, that &s;ometimes attends the di&s;tinct, is here always pre&s;ent at an earlier period, and ri&s;es to a greater height; the di&s;charge of &s;aliva is generally great about the &s;ame time; both &s;ub&s;ide about the tenth or eleventh day, counting from the attack of the incipient fever. With infants a lax is common in&s;tead of a &s;alination.</P>
<P>The pocks over the body, though di&s;tinct, are ge|nerally flat, and upon the whole, there is a great ten|dency to putrefaction.</P>
<P>The <HI>management</HI> of this &s;hould be much the &s;ame as that directed for the di&s;tinct, except that towards the latter end, when the patient grows weak, and &s;ymp|toms of putridity prevail, then the patient &s;hould have for drink, &s;ixty drops of elixir of vitriol, to one pint of &s;pirits and water, or wine and water, and a moderate de|gree of warmth &s;hould be kept up. Great attention &s;hould be given to keep the room clean, &s;weet and ventilated, as directed for the putrid fever.</P>
<P><HI>Treatment.</HI> When the &s;ymptoms appear as laid down, with con&s;iderable fever; give one &s;ixth of a grain of tartar emetic in apple-tea, or common drink of any kind, every hour. From the fifth day <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The day is always reckoned from the attack of the incipi|ent fever.</NOTE> on|ward,
<PB N="55" REF="029891_0054_0FE2C4FA2269D850">till the eruption be compleated, give twenty drops of laudanum, every morning and night, taking care to remove the co&s;tivene&s;s it occa&s;ions, by giving cream of tartar, or ca&s;tor oil daily, if nece&s;&s;ary. When the &s;econdary fever comes on, the &s;ame treatment with tartar emetic and laudanum &s;hould be u&s;ed, until the &s;ymptoms of putrefaction and weak pul&s;e take place, then all &s;hould be dropped, for bark and port wine, which may be given every hour, &s;o that the patient may take a pint of wine and one ounce of bark, from morning till bed time.</P>
<P>From the eighth day to the eleventh, when the fe|ver is violent, bli&s;ters &s;hould be laid on &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, without any re&s;pect to the pocks; the wri&s;ts, thighs, back of the neck, and brea&s;t, are proper places; when the &s;welling in the throat threatens &s;uffocation, a bli&s;ter &s;hould be applied over the throat, and the throat gar|gled with a mixture of one drachm of elixir of vitriol, to half a pint of &s;age tea and a little honey; or in|&s;tead of this, with vinegar and water.</P>
<P>If the fits, that u&s;ually attack children, happen but once or twice, nothing need be done but to keep them cool; but if they are frequent, they are likely to de&s;troy the patient; then as large a do&s;e of laudanum as the child can take, &s;hould be given.</P>
<P>The bark, with the vitriol and water &s;hould be con|tinued for a con&s;iderable time after the di&s;ea&s;e, to &s;trengthen the &s;y&s;tem, though it &s;hould be u&s;ed in a le&s;s quantity.</P>

THE SCARLET FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS complaint cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;eparated from the putrid &s;ore throat, as the affection of the throat, eruption of the &s;kin, and low or putrid fever, which are the chief &s;ymptoms, are attendants on both: added to this, the &s;ame contagion will affect one per|&s;on with what is judged to be the putrid &s;ore throat, and another with the &s;carlatina.

<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> A hereditary di&s;po&s;ition thereto, or a peculiar delicacy of the membrane that &s;uffers the inflammation; pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, a &s;udden cooling of the body after being heated by the &s;un, &s;pirituous liquors taken freely, hot drinks or hot baths, checked evacuations, moi&s;t air, and per&s;piration any how &s;top<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, generally excite the di&s;ea&s;e in tho&s;e predi&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="029891_0058_0FE2C515539FD1A8"><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It commonly comes on with &s;hivering and &s;ucceeding heat with fever; the pul&s;e is general|ly quick, &s;ometimes hard and full; a confu&s;ion of the head and &s;ome degree of delirium frequently attend, but a drow&s;ine&s;s almo&s;t always, which &s;ometimes in|crea&s;es to a comato&s;e &s;tate. After the&s;e &s;ymptoms have continued from one to three days, a redne&s;s mo&s;t commonly on the face appears, which increa&s;es with a &s;welling, that turns white, upon pre&s;&s;ing it with the finger. This goes on to increa&s;e, though it com|monly abates in one part a little, to increa&s;e in ano|ther; in this manner it &s;ometimes extends all over the head, and &s;wells the eye-lids, &s;o as to produce tempo|rary blindne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is not an uncommon ca&s;e for bli&s;ters to ari&s;e on the &s;welling, filled with yellow or whiti&s;h &s;erum, which break after awhile, and leave the part underneath blacki&s;h, and very ready to turn gangrenous; the &s;kin between the&s;e bli&s;ters peels off; matter is &s;ometimes di&s;charged from the eyelids: the inflammation and fe|ver u&s;ually continue about ten days, and then go off; when the fever goes on violently, and the inflammati|on extends, it is apt to produce an apoplexy.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the &s;ymptoms of a perfect di&s;ea&s;e, but &s;lighter affections are not unfrequent, even with little or no fever.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould be kept cool, in proportion to the greatne&s;s of the fever: acid drinks and vegetable diet &s;hould be u&s;ed throughout.</P>
<P><HI>Treatment.</HI> When the ca&s;e agrees with what is laid down above, half a pint or more of blood &s;hould be taken away, which may be repeated, if the habit al|low, and the pul&s;e and inflammation require it: after bleeding, cooling purgatives &s;hould be admini&s;tered; one ounce of Glauber &s;alts may be divided into four parts, one of which &s;hould be given every two hours, mixing it with lemon juice, which covers the bad ta&s;te.</P>
<P>This practice of admini&s;tering &s;alts may be followed for &s;ome days; they not only open the bowels, but
<PB N="60" REF="029891_0059_0FE2C51BAE9F8430">temperate the heat and fever: in &s;lighter ca&s;es bleed|ing &s;hould be laid a&s;ide, and the medicines given as directed.</P>
<P>Whenever there are any &s;ymptoms of putrefaction, as a low, weak pul&s;e, dark colouring of the tongue and mouth, acrid and black &s;pots underneath where the bli&s;ters &s;tood; then all evacuations (except keep|ing the bowels regular, with a little rhubarb) &s;hould be laid a&s;ide, and twelve grains of columbo root given every hour; when this can be kept on the &s;tomach well, and does not have &s;ufficient effect, as much bark &s;hould be given, and the do&s;e increa&s;ed as nece&s;&s;ity requires, or as it will fit on the patient: wine and water, and vitriol and water, made by putting two tea-&s;poonfuls of elixir of vitriol to a pint of water, may be drank alternately and freely.</P>
<P>The patient is mo&s;t always wanting &s;ome topical application, for this phy&s;icians have thought that meal &s;prinkled on the part, is the only proper application; this, when the inflammation is con&s;iderable, fits agree|ably, and has &s;ome effect in &s;oftening the &s;kin, and if &s;prinkled on very &s;lightly when the bli&s;ters di&s;charge, it dries up the humour: however patients are not con|tent with it, therefore apply either of the following with a rag moi&s;tened in it: half a pint of &s;trong tea of camomile flowers, or wormwood tops, fifteen grains of white vitriol, and a tea-&s;poonful of lau|danum or a &s;trong &s;olution of allum.</P>
<P>Sometimes from neglect, the part &s;uppurates; then it &s;hould be poulticed with bread and milk till it is ripe, when it &s;hould be opened and dre&s;&s;ed with lint &s;pread with wax and oil melted together; this need only be applied over the &s;ore.</P>
<P>Bark and vitriol, with fre&s;h air, gentle exerci&s;e in a carriage in fair weather, will be proper to brace up the habit in the end.</P>

THE ESSERA, OR NETTLE RASH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS generally attacks tho&s;e of a delicate con&s;ti|tution, e&s;pecially &s;uch as have a fine &s;kin, the ex|ce&s;&s;ive irritability of which appears to be a cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>From the above it would appear, that women and children are the chief &s;ubjects of it; which is agree|able to ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It u&s;ually comes on in the night, pro|ducing great re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and itching. In the morning con&s;iderable red eminences are to be ob&s;erved on &s;ome parts of the body, u&s;ually about the upper arms, neck, and brea&s;t; their forms are irregular, &s;ome being like the &s;troke of a whip, others like the &s;ting of a mo&s;que|to. It is not unfrequent for them to di&s;appear in the cour&s;e of the day, and return again at night: the time of continuance is various, as they &s;ometimes continue for a week, and &s;ometimes for a year or more.</P>
<P>They have never been known to have any dangerous effect; the itching being all that is di&s;agreeable, which at times is &s;o trouble&s;ome as to prevent &s;leep.</P>

BLEEDING AT THE NOSE.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH this complaint attends at any age and may trouble any con&s;titution, yet it does not make the di&s;order I mean to treat of, except when it attacks young people, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are full of blood.</P>
<P>The animal oeconomy finds it proper not to increa&s;e the different parts equally from the time of conception, but increa&s;es certain parts &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, this increa&s;e is brought about by a determination of blood to the&s;e parts: hence the different periods of life, that we &s;ee fluxes of blood making their appearance may be ea&s;ily accounted for: and hence this complaint in the youth|ful, and the following complaint immediately after that period.</P>
<P>It requires attention, or it will &s;oon be accompani|ed with very di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> A head-ach, redne&s;s of the eyes, florid countenance, and throbbing of the temporal arteries, u&s;ually precede for a while before the effu&s;ion, but im|mediately before it a fulne&s;s of the face, and itching at the no&s;e take place: be&s;ide the&s;e, frequently more ge|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">toms are ob&s;ervable; as co&s;tivene&s;s, pale <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of the feet, and &s;hivering<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this is a de|&s;cription which &s;uits the mo&s;t perfect &s;tate of the complaint.</P>
<P>The quantity of blood di&s;charged is various.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> In the time the bleeding comes on the patient &s;hould be placed in a &s;tream of cool air,
<PB N="63" REF="029891_0062_0FE2C52C292CB9C8">and be &s;upported erect; he &s;hould avoid talking, or blowing his no&s;e.</P>
<P>In the intervals he &s;hould avoid heat, &s;tooping his head, or walking fa&s;t, more e&s;pecially after eating: his exerci&s;e &s;hould be gentle and con&s;tant, and this may be partly in riding and walking, and partly in the oc|cupation of his bu&s;ine&s;s, if that be mechanical. The cold bath may be u&s;ed daily, in which he may remain &s;ome time; this has, be&s;ide a bracing property, a tendency to make the patient lean: a little care &s;hould be u&s;ed in the beginning; no cap &s;hould be worn on the head to keep the water from that part. He &s;hould live upon a vegetable diet chiefly, and u&s;e cold water for his con&s;tant drink.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> In beginning to treat the patient, if he has not already lo&s;t much blood, a few ounces may be tak|en from him, a little before the time of the bleeding's coming on, and ever afterward a do&s;e of &s;alts may be u&s;ed at the &s;ame time; and it may be ob&s;erved in gene|ral, that it will be nece&s;&s;ary to keep the bowels very regular. If after the &s;alts have been taken, the di&s;po|&s;ition is not removed, one of the fever powders, No. 1. may be u&s;ed every two hours, for two days, and large quantities of lemon-juice taken between each do&s;e.</P>
<P>When the bleeding comes on, it may be &s;uffered to continue till &s;ix ounces have been di&s;charged, provided the patient be full of blood, but if otherwi&s;e, it &s;hould be &s;topped immediately, by pouring cold water on his head, hands and te&s;ticles, and by drinking cold water; at the &s;ame time, u&s;ing do&s;&s;ils of lint, dip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> a &s;trong &s;olution of allum and water, or in any common a&s;tringent, and applied up the no&s;e; a piece of &s;ponge is &s;ometimes of &s;ervice; a weak &s;olution of blue&s;tone has &s;ometimes &s;topped the bleeding, after other things have failed. But in many ca&s;es neither of the above will an&s;wer, then the patient's life is in danger, and the following &s;imple method may be u&s;ed by any com|mon per&s;on, who has the lea&s;t degree of pre&s;ence of mind; take a needleful of &s;ilk, wax it and tie to one end of it a do&s;&s;il of well &s;craped lint, about as large as
<PB N="64" REF="029891_0063_0FE2C533936BA248">a thumb, get a piece of cat-gut &s;tring &s;everal inches long, grea&s;e it a little, pu&s;h this cat-gut through the bleeding no&s;tril into the mouth, till you ob&s;erve it come out near the throat, lay hold of it with a pair of narrow pincers or forceps, or in their &s;tead, with a dull pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and draw it till you have both ends in your hands; tie a knot in the end that you have drawn through, and to this knot fa&s;ten your &s;ilk and draw back the cat-gut till you have drawn the do&s;&s;il of lint again&s;t the orifice of the pa&s;&s;age that leads into the throat, then you need only &s;top up the no&s;tril with another do&s;&s;il of lint, which will &s;hut up the pa&s;&s;age altogether, and hinder any more blood from coming out. The hint &s;hould be kept in for three or four days.</P>
<P>The cat-gut is only for the purpo&s;e of getting the &s;ilk through, which is too limber of it&s;elf: In pu&s;h|ing the cat-gut through, you are not to pu&s;h it up|wards, as the no&s;trils apparently lead, but directly backward, aiming at the upper part of the throat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">here it comes out; the no&s;trils turn at about half an inch after you have pu&s;hed it upwards. By the &s;tated returns of this complaint, and the habit of the patient as well as by the quantity, you may ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h it from what is termed, a pa&s;&s;ive flowing of blood from the no&s;e.</P>
<P>In this complaint, the u&s;ual topical applications for the other kind are &s;ufficient; but with this the cold both may be u&s;ed, which is an effectual remedy, from my own experience; with this or without it, tincture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> iron, No. 7 may be u&s;ed.</P>

SPITTING OF BLOOD.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Be&s;ides the predi&s;po&s;ition mentioned in the preceding chapter, we may con&s;ider, as exciting cau&s;es, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed evacuations, &s;udden changes of the
<PB N="65" REF="029891_0064_0FE2C538FB39B288">air from heavy to lighter, violent efforts, compre&s;&s;ion in different parts, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> After &s;ome general di&s;order, as flatulen|cy, chills, &amp;c. a fulne&s;s is often felt about the che&s;t. From the blood being poured out, an irritation is made, to relieve which, the patient hawks or coughs, by which means he di&s;charges a little frothy, reddi&s;h, and &s;omewhat &s;alti&s;h &s;pittle; this &s;en&s;ation often re|turns again, and the &s;pittle is thrown out of a deeper red. In this manner the patient u&s;ually di&s;charges the blood for &s;ome hours or days, when it cea&s;es for that period. But it &s;ometimes happens, that the rup|ture is more con&s;iderable, and the pure blood is di&s;|charged in &s;uch quantities, as to excite vomiting; in &s;uch a ca&s;e the patient's life is in immediate danger. A cough u&s;ually follows the bleeding, which returns &s;ometimes every week, and &s;o on at every period be|tween that and a year.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> This &s;hould be exactly as de&s;cribed for the preceding di&s;order, only that the cold bath &s;hould not be u&s;ed, as we have not &s;ufficient experi|ence to recommend it, and the cold &s;hould be here very moderate, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> when it is &s;evere, it determines the blood to the lungs, which is to be avoided.</P>
<P><HI>Treatment.</HI> If the patient be able to bear it, blood &s;hould be taken away, though not in profu&s;ion. As &s;oon as the bleeding takes place, this &s;hould be follow|ed by a do&s;e of Glauber &s;alts. And ever afterwards when we apprehend from the &s;ymptoms before de|&s;cribed, that the bleeding is about to return, we &s;hould anticipate it by the repetition of the &s;alts, which I have &s;een attended with the be&s;t &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>When the bleeding is copious, be&s;ides the manage|ment of expo&s;ing the patient to cool air, let him take a tea-&s;poonful of common &s;alt, and repeat it when ne|ce&s;&s;ary. This has been often effectual, and may be carried in the per&s;on's pocket, when repeated &s;mall bleedings plague him, or ten grains of allum every hour. In the intervals nitre &s;hould be given to reduce and cool the &s;y&s;tem, ten grains in flax&s;eed tea, may
<PB N="66" REF="029891_0065_0FE2C5420AEAFBA0">be given three or four times a day; after the commo|tion has cea&s;ed, the country air &s;hould be u&s;ed. It is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to take a tea-&s;poonful of pare|goric elixir at night, in the morning, and at noon, to quell the cough.</P>

CONSUMPTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> A hereditary, natural or acquired debi|lity of the lungs, may be looked upon as cau&s;es of this fatal di&s;order: under &s;uch circum&s;tances, almo&s;t any irritation upon tho&s;e parts will e&s;tabli&s;h the con|&s;umption; and it is &s;omewhat doubtful if any cau&s;e will do the &s;ame, without the predi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> Cough, pain about the brea&s;t, &s;pitting of nau&s;eous matter at all times of the day, which is &s;ometimes &s;treaked with blood; a fever which comes in at noon, frequently with &s;hivering, and mo&s;t al|ways with coldne&s;s, which remits towards the after|noon, to exacerbate or renew its violence at night, continuing with the other affections, and after awhile being followed in its &s;econd fit towards morning with a copious &s;weat.</P>
<P>The pul&s;e in this fever, which is a hectic, is quick and mo&s;t generally weak, though in its fir&s;t attack &s;ome degree of hardne&s;s is to be felt. The fever is always kindled by taking much food at a time. To|wards the end of the con&s;umption, a lax takes place which generally carries off the patient.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould live upon a light dige&s;tible diet; milk, vegetables, &s;poon-meats, pud|dings, pies, &amp;c. are proper; the&s;e &s;hould be taken in &s;mall quantities at a time, and u&s;ed the oftener, on that account. The teas and drinks pre&s;cribed for fe|vers, are the proper drinks to be u&s;ed.</P>
<P>Exerci&s;e in a carriage or &s;ailing, are almo&s;t indi&s;|pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary; the country air is &s;o far preferable
<PB N="67" REF="029891_0066_0FE2C546AAD14208">to the town, that the former will &s;ometimes alone per|fect a cure, and the latter re&s;i&s;t every means. Cold &s;hould be guarded again&s;t; and for this as well as other rea&s;ons, a flannel &s;hirt &s;hould be worn.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> If the patient is not low and thin, he &s;hould be bled every week for three or four times, taking away about a quarter of a pint of blood each time, till all &s;igns of increa&s;ed action or hardne&s;s are gone from the pul&s;e; if they give way at the fir&s;t bleeding no more is to be u&s;ed. After this, or when this is not allowable, eight grains of ipecacuana &s;hould be given every four days, for as many times as they ap|pear to be beneficial: when this has been done, the patient &s;hould take twenty drops of elixir of vitriol, early in the morning, at ten o'clock, and again af|ter the noon fever has abated and before the even|ing one has come on. To allay the cough take two ounces of paregoric, two grains of tartar emetic, or when tartar does not agree, two ounces of the &s;pirits of nitre dulcified: two &s;mall tea-&s;poonfuls may be u&s;ed at night, and half that quantity taken at any time in the day when it is trouble&s;ome. When the pain in the brea&s;t is con&s;iderable, bli&s;ters may be u&s;ed; a &s;e|ton &s;hould be put in the &s;ide in the beginning.</P>
<P>The bowels &s;hould be kept regular, with &s;mall do&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of ca&s;tor oil, &s;ulphur, magne&s;ia, or cream of tartar.</P>
<P>The above pre&s;criptions, although the be&s;t and &s;im|ple&s;t that can be recommended, frequently fail, and when the di&s;ea&s;e threatens to re&s;i&s;t them, a &s;ea voyage &s;hould be recommended as the only refuge.</P>
<P>It is not unfrequent that the con&s;umption is com|bined with other affections, then we mu&s;t have regard to the&s;e affections, or no cure can be expected. But &s;uch ca&s;es are &s;o complex, that they require the judg|ment of an able phy&s;ician.</P>

THE PILES.</HEAD>
<P>A LAXITY of the gut affected, natural or ac|quired, di&s;po&s;es to this complaint, &s;o much that &s;light cau&s;es bring it about.</P>
<P>The following are found to be the u&s;ual cau&s;es, viz. much walking or riding, co&s;tivene&s;s, long continuance in an erect po&s;ture, &s;trong purges, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, natu|ral or artificial evacuations; falling down of the gut, drinking large quantities of watery liquors, grief, ob|&s;tructions of the liver, pregnancy, high living, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> The &s;ymptoms of this di&s;ea&s;e being not always alike, have made &s;ome variety and di&s;tinction of it. Thus there is the blind piles, when the tumour is not vi&s;ible; the common piles, when tumours ap|pear without bleeding; and the bleeding piles, when they di&s;charge blood. However, there are general &s;ymptoms which are common to all; as, a pain and &s;wimming in the head, &s;tupor, &s;ick &s;tomach with pains in the bowels and back, which frequently precede, and in &s;ome ca&s;es a fever al&s;o: a &s;en&s;e of fulne&s;s and itching are the local &s;ymptoms: the&s;e are &s;oon reliev|ed in the bleeding piles, when that takes place, and frequently the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the tumour is attended with an alleviation of the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>Sometimes blood only comes away with the &s;tools; but at other times a con&s;iderable, con&s;tant di&s;charge alarms the patient. This affection is apt to return at &s;tated intervals, and to increa&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> All the cau&s;es as far as po&s;&s;ible are to be avoided, and temperance is &s;trictly to be ob&s;erved by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ethoric; light vegetable food, and cool acid drinks are proper during the affection.

<P>After a large di&s;charge, a general debility en&s;ues; the pul&s;e becomes weak, the &s;tomach &s;ick, re&s;piration difficult upon the lea&s;t motion; the feet cold and &s;woln, e&s;pecially towards evening, when a fever takes place of the hectic kind.

<P>The above &s;ymptoms take place more or le&s;s, &s;oon|er or later, according to the profu&s;ene&s;s and repetition of the di&s;charge.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The cau&s;es of this complaint di&s;cover to us, that it may take place in two &s;tates of the &s;y&s;tem, one when it is over-loaded or plethoric, the other when it is debilitated; ech of which require &s;eparate ma|nagement.</P>
<P>In the former ca&s;e, cold, ab&s;tinence, and cool drinks &s;hould be u&s;ed with vegetable diet in the intervals: in the latter, good nouri&s;hing food, port wine, and ex|erci&s;e are to be u&s;ed.

<P><HI>Cure.</HI> In the intervals the management pre&s;cribed will be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>In the period, the patient &s;hould be kept cool; ten grains of alum may be given every half hour; &s;ponges dipped in cold vinegar, may be applied to the &s;mall of the back, and to the parts, and if this does not an&s;wer, ten grains of ipecacuana may be given in a little water; after this give ten drops of elixir of vitriol every hour: to correct the laxity that &s;ucceeds, ten grains of ru&s;t of iron may be taken four times a-day, and in ca&s;es of much debility, the Peruvian bark al&s;o.</P>
<P>When the men&s;es return more frequently, or flow more plentifully than natural, the patient &s;hould be on her guard, look for the cau&s;es, and obviate them.</P>

<P><HI>SYMPTOMS.</HI> A di&s;charge of whiti&s;h mucus flows in&s;tead of the men&s;es, or after them, and continues longer and longer, till it becomes pretty con&s;tant.</P>
<P><HI>Treatment.</HI> As when this ca&s;e takes place, debility is generally pre&s;ent, a nouri&s;hing diet may be u&s;ed, with port wine and water, more or le&s;s, in proportion to the debility, and gentle, regular exerci&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> The &s;teel, as recommended above, is one of the be&s;t remedies; with this topical applications &s;hould be made, with a &s;yringe. Decoctions of Peruvian bark, oak-bark, or galls, are proper.</P>

OBSTRUCTED MENSES.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Cold is one of the mo&s;t common cau&s;es, either when applied to the body during men&s;trua|tion, or when it has at a preceding time brought on the complaint called a cold; di&s;ea&s;es of much pain or action in other parts, debility, exce&s;&s;ive evacuations, low pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, are al&s;o cau&s;es.</P>
<P>As the di&s;order is &s;o well marked, I need not men|tion the &s;ymptoms that en&s;ue in tho&s;e who have once had the men&s;es, but &s;hall confine my&s;elf to the &s;ymp|toms that take place in girls who have never had them although they have pa&s;&s;ed over the proper time. This is called properly a retention of the men&s;es.</P>
<P>The patient after the age of thirteen, but how long after is uncertain, is affected with a lo&s;s of appetite, &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s, la&s;&s;itude and debility; the countenance becomes pale or &s;warthy, and the body univer&s;ally flaccid, the legs &s;well, e&s;pecially at night, and the bel|ly &s;ometimes &s;wells al&s;o, whil&s;t pains affect the head,
<PB N="72" REF="029891_0071_0FE2C56869428BB8">back, and other parts: re&s;piration is generally labo|rious.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> It is clear, that neither the manage|ment nor the cure can be conducted on a &s;ingle plan: In the plethoric, and tho&s;e who have cold as a cau&s;e, low diet &s;hould be pre&s;cribed, with thin drinks, cool air, and re&s;t: but in tho&s;e emaciated, nouri&s;hing food, wine and exerci&s;e &s;hould be &s;trenuou&s;ly enforced.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> In tho&s;e of the former ca&s;e, that is, tho&s;e who are full of blood, or have much remaining &s;trength, perhaps nothing will relieve &s;ooner than blood-letting; with this &s;alts may be u&s;ed, and if the men&s;es do not return at the u&s;ual period, at that very juncture let the patient take four grains of calomel, and as many of aloes, in a little honey, and repeat the do&s;e next night if nece&s;&s;ary. Tho&s;e who are emaciated, or have a retention, &s;hould take ten grains of &s;teel every &s;ix hours, and a couple of do&s;es of bark daily, till the period arrives; and then, if nece&s;&s;ary, take the bo|lu&s;es as directed. A decoction of madder has been often u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

VOMITING OF BLOOD.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Ob&s;tructed men&s;es, and other evacuations &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; enlargement of the &s;pleen or liver, ero|&s;ions of the &s;tomach by poi&s;ons, &s;mall gla&s;s, &amp;c. and violent &s;training to vomit.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> Some pain about the &s;tomach, anxiety and vomiting of black grumous blood, without cough|ing.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient who is &s;ubject to this &s;hould live regularly and ab&s;temiou&s;ly, and endea|vour by every means to counteract &s;uh cau&s;es as ad|mit of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and u&s;e proper medicines for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. In time of a di&s;charge, the patient &s;hould retire from all clo&s;e places, into cool and fre&s;h air.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="029891_0072_0FE2C56D0CFAD0A0"><HI>Cure.</HI> Whatever may be the cau&s;e, we are to u&s;e the &s;ame means to &s;top an exce&s;&s;ive di&s;charge. Be&s;ides the treatment mentioned before, we may u&s;e gentle a&s;tringent medicines, as ten grains of alum di&s;&s;olved in water every half hour, till the vomiting has cea&s;ed &s;ome time; after which a decoction of oak bark may be u&s;ed for &s;ome days, in the &s;ame quantity, and made in the &s;ame manner as the decoction No. 3.</P>
<P>When an enlargement of the &s;pleen or liver is the cau&s;e, little hope remains of a cure; but the patient &s;hould not neglect to try the Virginia &s;ulphur &s;prings, which are very powerful deob&s;truents. When &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed evacuations are the cau&s;e, the means directed for them &s;hould be admini&s;tered; when acrids have been taken into the &s;tomach, they &s;hould be changed if po&s;|&s;ible, by their proper antidotes, or enveloped in &s;ome mild mucilage, as mucilage of gum arabic, or in oil, or &s;yrups. When vomiting is the cau&s;e, a few drops of laudanum in mint water, will put a &s;top to it.</P>

DISCHARGE OF BLOOD FROM THE URINARY PASSAGE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> The pa&s;&s;age of a &s;tone, hard riding, blows on the &s;mall of the back, &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the piles, acrid medicines, as can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rides taken internally, or ab&s;orbed from a bli&s;ter, or &s;ome putrid di&s;ea&s;es, as the confluent &s;mall pox.</P>

COLD.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSE.</HI> Cold applied partially or generally to the body, e&s;pecially after an increa&s;e of heat.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It frequently makes its appearance with a difficulty of breathing through the no&s;trils, a &s;en&s;e of fulne&s;s and &s;toppage there; this is followed with a pain in the forehead, &s;tiffne&s;s and redne&s;s of the eyes and di&s;charge from the no&s;e. When the affection is any wor&s;e, the patient is &s;ubject to chills and feveri&s;hne&s;s, which is con&s;iderable towards evening, a hoar&s;ene&s;s, &s;ore throat, cough, flying or fixed pains of different parts, and not unfrequently &s;ome difficulty of re&s;piring.</P>
<P>The cough in the beginning is u&s;ually dry, but as the other Symytoms give way, it becomes moi&s;t, more ea&s;y, and attended with a di&s;charge of whiti&s;h or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l|low mucus, which is mo&s;t frequent; this goes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ff at different periods, according to the patient's age, &s;tate, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould confine him&s;elf to the hou&s;e, in a temperate room, and live upon vegeta|bles and cool acid mucilaginous drinks, as barley wa|ter or flax&s;eed tea &s;weetened and acidulated with lemon juice or vinegar.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> If the feveri&s;hne&s;s and difficulty of breath|ing are con&s;iderable, bleeding &s;hould not be omitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with or without this, a do&s;e of &s;alts &s;hould be taken, after which &s;weating &s;hould be practi&s;ed: one of the powders No. 1. may be given every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">r, wa&s;hing it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

INFLUENZA.</HEAD>
<P>THE cau&s;e of this is a &s;pecific contagion, pro|ceeding from &s;ome very general alteration in the air. There is no doubt of its being communicated from one per&s;on to another.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> The mo&s;t common &s;ymptoms are tho&s;e of the common cold de&s;cribed above, attacking a whole town or neighbourhood at once. But that is not its con&s;tant form; for &s;ometimes it puts on the appearance of a pleuri&s;y, with a &s;trong pul&s;e, at other times a pain in the &s;ide with a weak pul&s;e, whil&s;t in a th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ca&s;e it has produced all the &s;ymptoms of a low nervous fever.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> This is in general to be directed as in the common cold; but when it has the form of a low fever, wine and water &s;hould be the con&s;tant drink.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> In &s;ome of the mo&s;t violent ca&s;es, e&s;pecially when the patient's habit has been full, it has been ne|ce&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful to bleed, and bli&s;ter the pained part: this latter need never be neglected, where the pain is fixed. Vomits of ipecacuana, antimonial wine, or ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> are always &s;erviceable, and interrupt the di&s;order &s;ooner than any other medicine. Gentle &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">at|ing
<PB N="76" REF="029891_0075_0FE2C583D16483C0">with whey, and a little antimonial wine is never to be neglected. This is to be u&s;ed after vomiting, when that is intended.</P>
<P>The bowels &s;hould be kept regular by &s;mall do&s;es of ca&s;ter oil, Glauber &s;alts, cream of tartar, or jalap. When the cough is trouble&s;ome, &s;yrup of &s;quills may be u&s;ed, one tea-&s;poonful every three hours; or what in &s;ome ca&s;es an&s;wers better, the following mixture; paregoric elixir one tea-&s;poonful, antimonial wine twenty drops; this may be taken twice or three times, in the cour&s;e of a day. Honey and vinegar boiled to|gether, &s;permaceti and loaf &s;ugar, extract of liquo|rice, &amp;c. are frequently u&s;eful to take in the mouth every quarter of an hour.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of a low fever, wine and bark are to be given freely, after giving a gentle do&s;e of ipecacuana. If the &s;tomach refu&s;es bark, elixir of vitriol is to be u&s;ed in its &s;tead, ten or fifteen drops every hour.</P>

FLUX.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SYMPTOMS.</HI> Sometimes a fever makes the at|tack, at other times the bowels are primarily af|fected; fir&s;t, with co&s;tivene&s;s and flatulency, then with gripes and frequent painful efforts to &s;tool, when no|thing of a natural &s;ort is di&s;charged, but &s;lime of a whiti&s;h, bloody, or blacki&s;h colour, in con&s;iderable quantities.</P>
<P>In &s;ome few in&s;tances a lax has preceded. What|ever is voided of the natural kind, is generally in &s;mall hard balls.</P>
<P>The &s;tomach in general is di&s;ordered, and that from the beginning; but it goes off as the complaint proceeds downwards, which it generally does, till all is fixed in the lower end of the la&s;t gut, where it produces that
<PB N="77" REF="029891_0076_0FE2C588AE797600">trouble&s;ome effort of it called tene&s;mus. The feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms continue a con&s;iderable time, remitting and then acceding again.</P>
<P>Whenever the di&s;ea&s;e takes a putrid turn, which it is apt to do, it may be known by the foetor and black|ne&s;s of the di&s;charges, a lowne&s;s of the pul&s;e and gene|ral debility.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> Great attention &s;hould be paid to cleanline&s;s, by removing the chamber furniture, and &s;hifting the bed clothes often; the patient &s;hould live upon dige&s;tible vegetables, as rice, barley, &amp;c. and milk preparations, as thickened milk, light puddings, chicken water, and light broths may al&s;o be u&s;ed, if the patient is fond of them. And for drinks, teas, jelly and water, and apple water; which may be taken milk warm.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> To procure regular natural &s;tools, is half the cure; for which purpo&s;e, a table-&s;poonful of ca&s;|tor oil is to be given every hour, till it produces that effect; this may be repeated every other day, for &s;eve|ral times, as the patient may require; after this, if the patient is very &s;ick, eight grains of ipecacuana may be given; after which two grains of ipecacuana may be admini&s;tered every two hours, &s;o as not to in|terfere with taking the oil, as long as the fever la&s;ts. After the u&s;e of the&s;e medicines for &s;ome time, laudu|num may be given to relieve the pain, fifteen drops morning and night, mixed up with two grains of ipecacuana.</P>
<P>If the above medicines are not handy, or if there is any objection to them, the following may be u&s;ed, a do&s;e of &s;alts and manna, once or twice in the begin|ning, after which, put two grains of tartar emetic, or a table-&s;poonful of antimonial wine in a quart of ap|ple tea, and take it in &s;mall quantities, every quarter of an hour, &s;o as to con&s;ume the whole in a day; after taking it till the fever is removed, then u&s;e the laudanum. When the complaint has a putrid turn, as well as to remove the debility after a common ca&s;e, twelve grains of columbo root &s;hould be taken every two or three hours.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="029891_0077_0FE2C5906E0E0DE8">If the di&s;ea&s;e leaves a loo&s;ene&s;s, a decoction of log|wood or tormentil &s;hould be u&s;ed.</P>

APOPLEXY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;order mo&s;t commonly attacks the aged, &s;uch as have large heads, &s;hort necks, corpu|lent habits, and indolent di&s;po&s;itions, who have fed high, and u&s;ed much &s;trong drink. If, in addition to the&s;e, they have had a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of any evacua|tion, as the piles, they can &s;carce expect to e&s;cape an apoplexy.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> Sometimes a head-ach and &s;wimming of the eyes, with other affections of the head precede; at other times, it &s;uddenly attacks the patient as he reclines his head, or makes &s;ome effort, with a lo&s;s of internal and external &s;en&s;e, an almo&s;t total deprivation of voluntary motion. The patient's face often becomes flu&s;hed and &s;woln, his eyes red, his pul&s;e full and &s;low, his breathing &s;omewhat difficult, with &s;noring.</P>
<P>The time that this &s;tate la&s;ts, is uncertain; &s;ome|times the patient comes to his &s;en&s;es in a few hours, with a vomiting and &s;weat, at other times he lays days, and frequently never recovers.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould be laid on a bed with his head rai&s;ed as high as it conveniently can; his neck cloth &s;hould be &s;tripped off, and he &s;hould be placed in a cool room. If the fit continues long, a little water may be poured down his throat, if po&s;&s;ible, twice or three times a-day; when he is on the reco|very, his diet &s;hould be as light as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome ca&s;es which may be termed apo|plexy, which demand treatment only from the &s;urgeon, as when it depends upon a fracture of the &s;kull.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> The patient &s;hould be bled as freely as his con&s;titution will allow: this may be done at different
<PB N="79" REF="029891_0078_0FE2C5950E3C12D0">times, rather than at once. After bleeding, a cly&s;ter of Ca&s;tile &s;oap, di&s;&s;olved in water, &s;hould be given, one drachm of &s;oap to a pint of water, or in&s;tead of that, two table-&s;poonfuls of antimonial wine in as much water. The&s;e may be u&s;ed every &s;ix hours, for &s;everal times.</P>
<P>If the&s;e do not bring him to him&s;elf, a large bli&s;ter &s;hould be applied to the back of his neck, and &s;ina|pi&s;ms made of mu&s;tard, vinegar, and crumbs of bread, applied to the &s;oles of his feet. As &s;oon as the pati|ent is able to &s;wallow a pill, &s;ix grains of aloes, and as much &s;oap made into a bolus or pills, &s;hould be giv|en him every day, &s;o as to keep his bowels in regu|lar motion.</P>
<P>Gentle exerci&s;e &s;hould &s;oon be u&s;ed, and increa&s;ed till the patient is perfectly well: proper exerci&s;e and ab&s;tinence are the only &s;ecurities again&s;t a return. When the di&s;order ends in a pal&s;y, which it &s;ometimes does, the cure directed for pal&s;y is to be followed.</P>
<P><HI>Lethargy and Coma,</HI> which are &s;pecies of this di&s;or|der, are to be treated in the &s;ame way, having re&s;pect to the degree of the di&s;order and the patient's habit, and directing the evacuations in proportion to them.</P>

<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> A lo&s;s of &s;en&s;ation or ability of motion in the part affected, which is &s;ometimes one half of the patient, as the right &s;ide, or from the hips down|wards; at other times, only a &s;mall part is affected, as the hand, the arm, the leg.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> This is to be according to the pati|ent's habit: If he is full, a low diet is to be u&s;ed;
<PB N="80" REF="029891_0079_0FE2C59CA0B42970">if he is low, a &s;timulating diet and &s;pirituous drinks &s;hould be u&s;ed. The cau&s;es are, if po&s;&s;ible, to be removed.</P>

<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> Sometimes a languor, an anxiety, a gid|dine&s;s and dimne&s;s precede; at other times the faint|ing comes on &s;uddenly; the patient turns pale, &s;inks away, and appears dead; the pul&s;e being either im|perceptible, or very low; the breathing in the &s;ame &s;tate.</P>
<P>A cold &s;weat often breaks out, and &s;tands in drops upon the patient's forehead, which is as cold as a

DYSPEPSY, OR CONFIRMED INDIGESTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> The large u&s;e of coffee, tea, or any warm watery drinks, of tobacco, ardent &s;pirits, opium, bitters, &s;pices, and acids; putre&s;cent food, over-eat|ing, frequent unnece&s;&s;ary vomiting or purging: &s;ome di&s;orders, as intermittent fevers, fluxes, &amp;c. An indo|lent life, much application of mind, exce&s;&s;ive venery, long expo&s;ure, without exerci&s;e, to cold moi&s;t air.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> The great variety of &s;ymptoms in this affection together with the cau&s;es, is the rea&s;on that no two per&s;ons are identically alike affected; but ne|verthele&s;s the general or fundamental &s;ymptoms are al|ways alike; the&s;e I &s;hall &s;et down; a lo&s;s of appetite, di&s;ten&s;ions of the &s;tomach with wind, eructations after eating e&s;pecially, heart-burn, &s;ometimes a vomiting, frequent pains about the &s;tomach, and often a dejected mind.</P>

<P>The mo&s;t trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms are the wind and acid on the &s;tomach, and the co&s;tivene&s;s: for the wind and acid, a little magne&s;ia, chalk or lime-water, with &s;ome e&s;&s;ence of mint, &s;hould be taken occa&s;ionally.</P>
<P>For the co&s;tivene&s;s, the patient &s;hould be provided with a box of pills made with jalap or rhubarb; or with extract of white walnut bark, the&s;e may be taken occa&s;ionally; riding over agreeble country &s;eats, is one of the mo&s;t effectual remedies again&s;t a dejected mind.</P>
<P>For the radical cure, we are to attempt the removal of the debility in the fibres of the &s;tomach; for which purpo&s;e the waters of Berkley &s;prings, or of any cha|lybeute &s;prings, are the mo&s;t promi&s;ing: when the&s;e cannot be u&s;ed, any of the following medicines may be u&s;ed, as &s;hall be&s;t &s;uit.

<P><HI>Management,</HI> If any &s;ub&s;tance is lodged in the parts primarily affected, it &s;hould be removed immediately: the patient &s;hould be kept warm, and fed upon &s;uch food as can be got down.

<P><HI>Cure.</HI> It will be proper to remove a toe, or any &s;mall part, if that be the place of the wound, and to dre&s;s this, or whatever part may be hurt, with a &s;trong &s;uppurating &s;alve, as ba&s;ilicon (which is compo&s;ed of ro&s;in and wax, with a &s;ufficiency of oil to &s;often it) hav|ing fir&s;t &s;prinkled it with red precipitate: or if the&s;e things are not to be had, a little warm oil of turpentine.</P>
<P>The patient's bowels &s;hould be opened with ca&s;tor oil, or with jalap, and kept open; after this he &s;hould have one drachm of &s;trong mercurial ointment rubbed into his thighs and arms, morning, noon and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, till he &s;pits freely: after this it may be u&s;ed every other day, &s;o as ju&s;t to keep up a &s;pitting for a week or more, if the &s;ymptoms continue.

EPILEPSY, OR COMMON FITS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Wounds, and bony protuberan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s of the &s;kull; o&s;&s;ification of the membranes of the brain; acrimony of the fluids from contagion, degeneracy, &amp;c. pa&s;&s;ions, as anger, fear; &s;trong imagination of di&s;agreeable objects, and the &s;ight of &s;uch; conge&s;|tions of blood in the brain, produced by a plethoric &s;tate, by long continued &s;un-heat on the head; by in|toxication, &s;urfeit, &amp;c. irritations proceeding from worms: teething; &s;plinters in the fle&s;h; fractured bones; &s;tones in the kidney; the matter of ulcers; poi&s;ons, &amp;c. and la&s;tly, large evacuations of blood.</P>
<P>It will readily appear, that many of the above cau&s;|es do not produce fits generally; and hence there mu&s;t be a predi&s;po&s;ition in tho&s;e, in whom they will occa|&s;ion them. A predi&s;po&s;ition con&s;i&s;ts either in a great mobility of the mu&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, or in a relaxed &s;tate of the ve&s;&s;els of the brain, which allows of their being ea&s;ily forced beyond their power, and admitting of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="7 letters">tion.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> Sometimes the patient feels indi&s;po&s;ed for &s;ome time before the attack, with head-ach, gid|dine&s;s, fulne&s;s of the head, &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s, &amp;c. at other times the fit attacks without warning; the per&s;on falls down, and is variou&s;ly agitated, &s;ometimes one &s;ide more than the other; his tongue is often thru&s;t out of his mouth, and by that means is bit almo&s;t or quite through: after continuing &s;ome minutes in this &s;tate, his convul&s;ions cea&s;e, and he lies &s;ome time in a &s;leepy &s;tate, and then returns to him&s;elf, not knowing what has pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> It will be proper to hold the patient, &s;o as to keep him from hurting him&s;elf, and to put a piece of thick leather between his teeth, to keep him from injuring his tongue. It is &s;eldom or never nece&s;|&s;ary to pre&s;cribe any diet for the patient, except in
<PB N="85" REF="029891_0084_0FE2C5BA9A00EFC8">the intervals, when it is to be &s;uited to his &s;tate. If fulne&s;s is the cau&s;e of the fits, or he is of a full habit, a low vegetable diet, with hard exerci&s;e, &s;hould be u&s;ed; but for a contrary &s;tate, a nouri&s;hing diet and con&s;tant gentle exerci&s;e is to be u&s;ed. The cau&s;es &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">po&s;&s;ible be removed by operations or medi|cines, &s;uited to the cau&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> In full habits, a bleeding will be proper during the fit, or preceding it. However, if they fre|quently return, it will not do to bleed every time, but give a do&s;e of &s;alts in its &s;tead, at the time the patient expects the return. Be&s;ides this, very little can be done, except to adhere &s;trictly to the management directed, and to have an i&s;&s;ue put in the back of the neck.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e of thin habits, when &s;everal fits return quickly after one and the other, that is in one day, it will be proper to give twenty drops of laudanum; to have him bathed in warm water, and a warm milk and water cly&s;ter injected two or three times a-day. All this may be repeated if nece&s;&s;ary, in &s;ix or eight hours after.</P>
<P>But the chief thing con&s;i&s;ts in removing the mobility or irritability mentioned in the cau&s;e. For this, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;teel, and the cold bath are proper; they &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> u&s;ed a long while, with proper exerci&s;e and die<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> fits proceeding from &s;ome of the above cau&s;es, as fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> irritations, the removal of the cau&s;e is all that is re|quired. But it is lamentable, that &s;ome of the cau&s;es cannot be removed; as that from bony protuberances into the brain, &amp;c. for &s;uch there is no remedy.

<P>THIS is a convul&s;ive affection, partly under the influence of the will: It affects the patient's leg or arm, or both.

<P>BY this I do not mean every difficulty of breath|ing, but only that which returns periodically, de|pending upon a certain peculiar con&s;titution of the lungs. It u&s;ually ob&s;erves the changes of weather in its returns, and &s;eldom or never goes off entirely.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> It often begins with a tightne&s;s acro&s;s the brea&s;t, flatulency, and impediment in re&s;piration, which continues until the patient can &s;carcely get &s;uf|ficient breath to live.

BITE OF A MAD DOG.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SYMPTOMS.</HI> The wound fe&s;ters, and after &s;ome time, &s;eldom under a week or two, the patient be|comes languid and dejected. He then begins to dread water, and cannot &s;wallow it without great agonies and convul&s;ions of the face; after &s;ome time he cannot bear the &s;ight of it. He dozes, and every now and then &s;tarts from his &s;lumber; and &s;ometimes raves &s;o as to need confinement.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> The wound &s;hould be cut out, if it is on a part that admits of it; if not, let it be filled with gun powder, and this burned; after which it &s;hould be kept open for a month, by &s;prinkling it with red pre|cipitate, and dre&s;&s;ing it with a &s;alve made with wax, oil and ro&s;in. But if this has been neglected, there is no way left, but to &s;alivate the patient, by rubbing one drachm of mercurial ointment on him every &s;ix hours till he &s;pits freely; after which it may be applied every other night, &s;o as to keep up a plentiful &s;pitting for a week or ten days. This, if done in time, will often prevent the affection.</P>

<P><HI>CAUSES.</HI> Ob&s;tructions of the liver, compre&s;&s;ion of the blood-ve&s;&s;els from any cau&s;e, large evacuations, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed natural evacuations, cold and moi&s;ture long applied, hard drinking, general debility, particular debility of what is called the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, rup|ture of a lymphatic, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Symptoms.</HI> A &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine, drought, &s;welling of the belly, or the body in general, which u&s;ually re|tains the impre&s;&s;ion of the finger; towards the end fe|vers

<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould live upon light di|ge&s;tible food, and ob&s;erve the greate&s;t regularity: his drink &s;hould be wine and water, if he is thin or debili|tated: gentle exerci&s;e &s;hould be con&s;tantly u&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> It will be very well in the beginning, if the patient's &s;tate admits of it, to give two or three &s;mall purges, compo&s;ed of twenty grains of jalap, with a quarter of an ounce of cream of tartar: if this does not an&s;wer, we &s;hould try medicines that promote the uri|nary &s;ecretion; for which purpo&s;e two grains of pow|dered &s;quills may be given, twice a-day: or half an ounce of cream of tartar di&s;&s;olved in a quart of water, may be taken in the cour&s;e of the morning. An infu|&s;ion of hor&s;e-radi&s;h and garlic, in &s;pirit, has been &s;ome|times of u&s;e; al&s;o &s;trong cider, iron flakes, and mu&s;|tard-&s;eed put together.</P>
<P>From ten to twenty drops of an infu&s;ion of tobacco, in a little mint-water, twice a-day, have been u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s: al&s;o a tea-&s;poonful of &s;alt-petre in a little gin, twice a day.</P>
<P>If none of the above medicines have the de&s;ired ef|fect, there is but little chance of a recovery. However, after every thing el&s;e has been tried to no purpo&s;e, rubbing the belly, when the drop&s;y affects that part, with warm oil for a long while, every day, before a fire, has proved effectual.</P>
<P>Bitters and &s;teel are always u&s;eful, and &s;hould be taken with the other medicines, only at another hour.</P>
<P>There is a kind of drop&s;y, which affects only the ca|vity of the brea&s;t, which is known by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the water makes, when the patient turns over; by its af|fecting the pul&s;e &s;o as to make it irregular in its &s;trokes; by its affecting the re&s;piration, and di&s;turbing the pa|tient in the night with a &s;en&s;ation of oppre&s;&s;ion. It is to be treated as the other drop&s;ies.</P>

<P><HI>SYMPTOMS.</HI> It makes its appearance generally between the ninth and twenty-fourth month, in the following manner; the child becomes &s;edate, and grows lean, whil&s;t the head grows &s;omewhat out of form; the teeth come out &s;lowly, turn black, and fall out: in a little time the child becomes altogether mi&s;hapen, &s;ome parts growing whil&s;t others pine away: the &s;tools are liquid; and after a con&s;iderable time, a fever comes on, which continues till it puts an end to the pitiable object.</P>
<P>But when it is not &s;o bad, the child recovers as he grows, till he recovers all but his &s;hape.</P>
<P><HI>Management.</HI> The child &s;hould not be kept longer than u&s;ual at the brea&s;t, he &s;hould have a portion of meat for his diet, much tea &s;hould be avoided: he &s;hould be carried out every day for exerci&s;e, when the weather permits, and great attention &s;hould be paid to keeping him clean</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> If the weather is not very cold, let the child be dipped every morning in water immediately from the well: give him a tea-&s;poonful of the tincture No. 7. three or four times a-day, and let him take two or three grains of rhubarb, when co&s;tive.</P>
<P>Bark is al&s;o a good medicine, if the child can be prevailed on to take it.</P>

<P><HI>Management.</HI> The patient &s;hould live mo&s;tly on vegetables, except when very thin. Gentle exerci&s;e &s;hould be con&s;tantly u&s;ed; the drink &s;hould be wine and water, when in the above &s;tate, but if full, no|thing but water &s;hould be u&s;ed. The patient &s;hould carefully avoid cold and moi&s;ture.</P>
<P><HI>Cure.</HI> A gentle emetic &s;hould be tried, and if it is of &s;ervice, or does not do harm, it &s;hould be repeated; this is be&s;t &s;uited where there are gall-&s;tones: but if the liver be ob&s;tructed, the patient &s;hould take one grain of calomel, every night and morning, till his gums feel &s;ore.

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN man came fir&s;t out of the hands of the great Creator, clothed in body as well as in &s;oul, with immortality and incor|ruption, there was no place for phy&s;ic, or the art of healing. As he knew no &s;in, &s;o he knew no pain, no &s;ickne&s;s, weakne&s;s, or bodily di&s;order. The habitation wherein the angelic mind, the Divinae particula Aurae abode, though originally formed out of the du&s;t of the earth was liable to no decay. It had no &s;eeds of cor|ruption or di&s;&s;olution within it&s;elf. And there was nothing without to injure it: Heaven and earth and all the ho&s;ts of them were mild, be|nign and friendly to human nature. The entire creation was at peace with man, &s;o long as man was at peace with his Creator. So that well might
<Q>the morning &s;tars &s;ing together, and all the &s;ons of God &s;hout for joy.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. But &s;ince man rebelled again&s;t the Sove|reign of heaven and earth, how entirely is the &s;cene changed! The incorruptible frame hath put on corruption, the immortal has put on
<PB N="iv" REF="029891_0102_0FE2C62DA2C3EAE8">mortality. The &s;eeds of weakne&s;s and pain. of &s;ickne&s;s and death, are now lodged in our inmo&s;t &s;ub&s;tance; whence a thou&s;and di&s;orders continually &s;pring, even without the aid of ex|ternal violence. And how is the number of the&s;e increa&s;ed by every thing round about us! The heavens, the earth, and all things contain|ed therein, con&s;pire to puni&s;h the rebels again&s;t their Creator. The &s;un and moon &s;hed un|whole&s;ome influences from above; the earth ex|hales poi&s;onous damps from beneath; the bea&s;ts of the field, the birds of the air, the fi&s;hes of the &s;ea, are in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility: the air it&s;elf that &s;urrounds us on every &s;ide, is replete with the &s;hafts of death: yea, the food we eat, daily &s;aps the foundation of the life which cannot be &s;u&s;tained without it. So has the Lord of all &s;ecured the execution of his decree,&mdash;
<Q>Du&s;t thou art, and unto du&s;t thou &s;halt return.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. But can there nothing be found to le&s;&s;en tho&s;e inconveniencies, which cannot be wholly removed? To &s;often the evils of life, and pre|vent in part the &s;ickne&s;s and pain to which we are continually expo&s;ed? Without que&s;tion there may. One grand preventative of pain and &s;ick|ne&s;s of various kinds, &s;eems intimated by the great Author of nature in the very &s;entence that intails death upon us:
<Q>In the &s;weat of thy face &s;halt thou eat bread, till thou return to the ground.</Q>
The power of exerci&s;e, both to pre&s;erve and re&s;tore health, is greater than can well be conceived; e&s;pecially in tho&s;e who add temperance thereto; who if they do not confine them&s;elves altogether to eat either "bread or the herb of the field" (which God does not require them to do) yet &s;teadily ob&s;erve both that kind
<PB N="v" REF="029891_0103_0FE2C6337066CAF8">and mea&s;ure of food, which experience &s;hews to be mo&s;t friendly to &s;trength and health.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is probable, phy&s;ic, as well as religion, was in the fir&s;t ages chiefly traditional: every father delivering down to his &s;ons, what he had him&s;elf in like manner received, concerning the manner of healing both outward hurts, and the di&s;ea&s;es incident to each climate, and the me|dicines which were of the greate&s;t efficacy for the cure of each di&s;order. It is certain, this is the method wherein the art of healing is pre&s;erv|ed among the Americans to this day. Their di&s;ea&s;es are exceeding few; nor do they often occur, by rea&s;on of their continual exerci&s;e, and (till of late) univer&s;al temperance. But if any are &s;ick, or bit by a &s;erpent, or torn by a wild bea&s;t, the fathers immediately tell their children what remedy to apply. And it is rare that the patient &s;uffers long; tho&s;e medicines being quick, as well as, generally, infallible.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence it was, perhaps, that the ancients, not only of Greece and Rome, but even of bar|barous nations, u&s;ually a&s;&s;igned phy&s;ic a divine original. And indeed it was a natural thought, that HE who had taught it to the very bea&s;ts and birds, the Cretan Stag, the Egyptian Ibis, could not be wanting to teach man,
<Q>Sanctius his animal, menti&s;que capacius altae:</Q>
Yea, &s;ometimes even by tho&s;e meaner creatures: for it was ea&s;y to infer, "If this will heal that creature, who&s;e fle&s;h is nearly of the &s;ame tex|ture with mine, then in a parallel ca&s;e it will heal me." The trial was made: the cure was wrought: and experience and phy&s;ic grew up together.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="vi" REF="029891_0104_0FE2C638C6EA1C70">6. As to the manner of u&s;ing the medicines here &s;et down, I &s;hould advi&s;e, As &s;oon as you know your di&s;temper (which is very ea&s;y, un|le&s;s in a complication of di&s;orders, and then you would do well to apply to a phy&s;ician that fears God) <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> U&s;e the fir&s;t of the remedies for that di&s;ea&s;e, which occurs in the en&s;uing collec|tion; (unle&s;s &s;ome other of them be ea&s;ier to be had, and then it may do ju&s;t as well). <HI>Secondly,</HI> After a competent time, if it takes no effect, u&s;e the &s;econd, the third, and &s;o on. I have pur|po&s;ely &s;et down (in mo&s;t ca&s;es) &s;everal remedies for each di&s;order; not only becau&s;e all are not equally ea&s;y to be procured at all times, and in all places: but likewi&s;e the medicine that cures one man, will not always cure another of the &s;ame di&s;temper. Nor will it cure the &s;me man at all times. Therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary to have a variety. However I have &s;ubjoined the letter <HI>(I)</HI> to tho&s;e medicines which &s;ome think infalli|ble. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Ob&s;erve all the time the greate&s;t exactne&s;s in your regimen or manner of living. Ab&s;tain from all mixed, all high-&s;ea&s;oned food. U&s;e plain diet, ea&s;y of dige&s;tion; and this as &s;paringly as you can, con&s;i&s;tent with ea&s;e and &s;trength. Drink only water, if it agrees with your &s;tomach; if not, good, clear &s;mall beer. U&s;e as much exerci&s;e daily in the open air, as you can without wearine&s;s. Sup at &s;ix or &s;even on the lighte&s;t food; go to bed early, and ri&s;e betimes. To per&s;evere with &s;teadine&s;s in this cour&s;e, is often more than half the cure. Above all, add to the re&s;t (for it is not labour lo&s;t) that old unfa&s;hionable medicine, prayer. And have faith in God who
<Q><HI>killeth and maketh alive, who bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="7"><PB N="vii" REF="029891_0105_0FE2C61850ED0DB8">7. For the &s;ake of tho&s;e who de&s;ire, through the ble&s;&s;ing of God, to retain the health which they have recovered, I have added a few plain, ea&s;y rules, chiefly tran&s;cribed from Dr. Cheyne.</P>
<P N="1">I. 1. The air we breathe is of great con&s;e|quence to our health. Tho&s;e who have been long abroad in ea&s;terly or northerly winds, &s;hould drink &s;ome thin and warm liquor going to bed, or a draught of toa&s;t and water.</P>
<P N="2">2. Tender people &s;hould have tho&s;e who lie with them, or are much about them, &s;ound, &s;weet, and healthy.</P>
<P N="3">3. Every one that would pre&s;erve health, &s;hould be as clean and &s;weet as po&s;&s;ible in their hou&s;es, clothes, and furniture.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. The great rule of eating and drinking, is, To &s;uit the quality and quantity of the food to the &s;trength of our dige&s;tion; to take always &s;uch a &s;ort and &s;uch a mea&s;ure of food, as fits light and ea&s;y on the &s;tomach.</P>
<P N="2">2. All pickled, or &s;moked, or &s;alted food, and all high-&s;ea&s;oned, are alone unfit for aliment.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nothing conduces more to health, than ab&s;tinence and plain food, with due labour.</P>
<P N="4">4. For &s;tudious per&s;ons, about eight ounces of animal food, and twelve of vegetable, in twenty four hours, are &s;ufficient.</P>
<P N="5">5. Water, though the whole&s;ome&s;t of all drinks, yet if u&s;ed largely in time at dige&s;tion, is injurious.</P>
<P N="6">6. Strong, and more e&s;pecially &s;pirituous li|quors, are a certain, though &s;low, poi&s;on, unle&s;s well diluted, and cautiou&s;ly u&s;ed.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="viii" REF="029891_0106_0FE2C63CCEE504D0">7. Experience &s;hews, there is very &s;eldom any danger in leaving them off all at once; unle&s;s in time of particular di&s;ea&s;es, as of debility.</P>
<P N="8">8. Strong liquors do not prevent the mi&s;chiefs of a &s;urfeit, nor carry it off &s;o &s;afely as water.</P>
<P N="9">9. Malt liquors (except clear &s;mall beer, or &s;mall ale, of a due age) are exceeding hurtful to tender per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="10">10. Coffee and tea are extremely hurtful to per&s;ons who have weak nerves.</P>
<P N="3">III 1. All per&s;ons &s;hould eat very light &s;up|pers; and that two or three hours before going to bed.</P>
<P N="2">2. To go to bed about nine, and ri&s;e at five, &s;hould be a general practice.</P>
<P N="4">IV. 1. A due degree of exerci&s;e is indi&s;pen|&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to health and long life.</P>
<P N="2">2. Walking is the be&s;t exerci&s;e for tho&s;e who are able to bear it; riding for tho&s;e who are not. The open air, when the weather is fair contributes much to the benefit of exerci&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. We may &s;trengthen any weak part of the body by con&s;tant exerci&s;e. Thus the lungs may be &s;trengthened by moderate &s;peaking; the dige&s;|tion and the nerves, by riding; the arms and hams, by &s;trongly rubbing them daily.</P>
<P N="4">4. The &s;tudious ought to have &s;tated times for exerci&s;e, at lea&s;t two or three hours a-day: the one half of this before dinner, the other before going to bed.</P>
<P N="5">5. They &s;hould frequently &s;have, and fre|quently wa&s;h their feet in cold water.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="ix" REF="029891_0107_0FE2C64226EB6100">6. Tho&s;e who read or write much, &s;hould learn to do it chiefly &s;tanding; otherwi&s;e it will im|pair their health.</P>
<P N="7">7. The fewer cloathes any one u&s;es, by day or night, the hardier he will be; but the habit mu&s;t be begun in youth.</P>
<P N="8">8. Exerci&s;e, fir&s;t, &s;hould be always on an empty &s;tomach; &s;econdly, &s;hould never be con|tinued to wearine&s;s; thirdly, after it, we &s;hould take care to cool by degrees: otherwi&s;e we &s;hall catch cold.</P>
<P N="9">9. The fle&s;h-bru&s;h is a mo&s;t u&s;eful exerci&s;e, e&s;pecially to &s;trengthen any part that is weak.</P>
<P N="10">10. Cold bathing is of great advantage to health: it prevents abundance of di&s;ea&s;es. It pro|motes per&s;piration, helps the circulation of the blood, and prevents the danger of catching cold. Tender people &s;hould pour water upon the head be|fore they go in, and walk in &s;wiftly. To jump in with the head foremo&s;t, is too great a &s;hock to nature. It is be&s;t to u&s;e it immediately after ri&s;ing.</P>
<P N="5">V. 1. Co&s;tivene&s;s cannot long con&s;i&s;t with health. Therefore care &s;hould be taken to remove it at the beginning by a gentle medicine; and when it is removed, to prevent its return, by &s;oft, cool, open diet; as of vegetables, acid or &s;weet.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ob&s;tructed per&s;piration (vulgarly called catching <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">old) is one great &s;ource of di&s;ea&s;es. Whenever there appears the lea&s;t &s;ign of this, let it be removed by gentle &s;weats, or purges.</P>
<P N="6">VI. 1. The pa&s;&s;ions have a greater influence on health, than mo&s;t people are aware of.</P>
<P N="2">2. All violent and &s;udden pa&s;&s;ions di&s;po&s;e to, or actually throw people into, acute di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="x" REF="029891_0108_0FE2C64770FA1600">3. The &s;low and la&s;ting pa&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as grief and hopele&s;s love, bring on chronic di&s;ea&s;es, and low fevers.</P>
<P N="4">4. Till the pa&s;&s;ion which cau&s;ed the di&s;ea&s;e, is calmed, medicine is applied in vain.</P>
<P N="5">5. The love of God, as it is the &s;overeign re|medy of all mi&s;eries, &s;o in particular it effec|tually prevents all the bodily di&s;orders the pa&s;|&s;ions introduce, by keeping the pa&s;&s;ions them|&s;elves within due bounds. And by the un&s;peak|able joy, and perfect calm, &s;erenity, and tran|quillity it gives the mind, it becomes the mo&s;t powerful of all the means of health and long life.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Friends and Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE grand intere&s;ts of your &s;ouls will ever lie near our hearts; but we cannot be un|mindful of your bodies: In &s;everal parts of this exten&s;ive country, the climate, and in others the food, is unwhole&s;ome: and frequently, the phy&s;icians are few, &s;ome of them un&s;kilful, and all of them beyond the reach of your temporal abilities. A few &s;mall publications excepted, little has been done by phy&s;ical books, in order to remove the&s;e inconveniencies: and even tho&s;e have been written in Europe, and do there|fore partake of the confined ideas of the writers, who could not po&s;&s;ibly be fully acquainted with the peculiarities of the various di&s;ea&s;es incident to a people that inhabit a country &s;o remote from theirs.</P>
<P>Simple remedies are in general the mo&s;t &s;afe for &s;imple di&s;orders, and &s;ometimes do wonders under the ble&s;&s;ing of God. In this view we pre&s;ent to you now the PRIMITIVE PHYSIC, publi&s;hed by our much honoured friend JOHN WESLEY. But the difference being in many

<P>In this &s;tate we lay the publication before you, and earne&s;tly recommend it to you</P>
<P>As we apply all the profits of our books to charitable purpo&s;es, and the promoting the work of God, we think we have &s;ome right to intreat you (except in particular ca&s;es) to buy only our books, which are recommended by the confer|ence, and &s;igned with our &s;ignatures: and as we intend to print our books in future WITHIN THE STATES, and on a much larger &s;cale than we have hitherto done, we tru&s;t we &s;hall be able &s;oon to &s;upply you with as many of the choice&s;t of our publications, as the time and temporal abilities of tho&s;e of you, who do not live a life of &s;tudy, will require.</P>

<P>&rindx; <HI>Nothing tends more to prolong an ague, than indulg|ing a lazy indolent di&s;po&s;ition. The patient ought therefore between the fits to take as much exerci&s;e as he can bear; and to u&s;e a light diet, and for common drink, Port wine and water is the mo&s;t proper.</HI></P>
<P>* When all other means fail, give blue vitriol, from one grain to two grains, in the ab&s;ence of the fit, and repeat it three or four times in twenty-four hours.</P>
