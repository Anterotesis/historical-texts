<P>WAR is de&s;ervedly accounted a very great judgment; as &s;uch it is threat|ned in the &s;acred &s;criptures, and &s;uch e&s;|teemed by tho&s;e who have had &s;orrow|ful experience of its ravages. <HI>Every battle of the warrior is with confu&s;ed noi&s;e and gar|ments rolled in blood</HI><NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah ix.5.</NOTE>: Wherever it takes its rout it leaves a <HI>crim&s;on tract</HI> behind it, oc|ca&s;ions the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;preads de&s;|truction round; whil&s;t to compleat the dole|ful tragedy, <HI>famine</HI> and <HI>pe&s;tilence</HI> often times follow in its train. Per&s;ons of refined humanity cannot even contemplate it at a di&s;tance without the mo&s;t painful emotions. With the compa&s;&s;ionate prophet they are ready to cry out, <HI>my bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noi&s;e in me, I cannot hold my peace, be|cau&s;e

thou ha&s;t heard, O my &s;oul, the &s;ound of the trumpet, the alarm of war</HI><NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Jeremiah iv 19.</NOTE>. The idea is &s;hocking, the heart revolts at the pro&s;pect, and none but the <HI>&s;avage</HI> and <HI>inhuman</HI> can con&s;ider its tragical effects without horror: But though this be true, yet it frequently rages, its rumours are heard in different parts of the world, and perhaps there is no time when peace is at once enjoyed by all the inhabitants of the earth. It is melan|choly to reflect, that whil&s;t "devils with de|vils damned firm concord hold," men, who are under every po&s;&s;ible engagement to cul|tivate peace and love, &s;hould &s;uffer their brea&s;ts to be agitated by pa&s;&s;ions &s;o malig|nant as to excite &s;uch ob&s;tinate di&s;putes as cannot be decided, but by the &s;word, and terminate in all the horrors of war. Still more to be lamented is it, that they, who far from di&s;turbing others, de&s;ire only to &s;it under their own vine and fig-tree, enjoying the &s;weets of indu&s;try, friend&s;hip and liber|ty, &s;hould be mole&s;ted by the <HI>ambitious</HI> and <HI>tyrannical,</HI> and forced to fly to arms in &s;up|port of their inherent rights and privileges: But &s;uch is the depraved &s;tate of human nature, that in&s;tances like <HI>this</HI> are not un|common: <HI>Wars and fightings proceed from men's lu&s;ts, which war in their members,</HI> and are greatly prevalent &s;ince the apo&s;tacy.

avarice and revenge, being deeply radicated in the human heart, have convert|ed this earth, which otherwi&s;e would have been the peaceful retreat of innocence, into an horrid &s;cene of offen&s;ive wars, and a field of blood: The united con&s;iderations of rea&s;on and religion have never been &s;uf|ficiently powerful to re&s;train the&s;e lu&s;ts of men, and keep them from invading the per&s;ons, liberties and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of their neighbours. Hence it becomes nece&s;&s;ary for the <HI>humble</HI> and <HI>quiet,</HI> the <HI>meek</HI> and <HI>in|offen&s;ive</HI> to turn their attention to the art of war; and while they breathe the pacific &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, to furni&s;h them&s;elves with the in&s;truments of &s;laughter: This is requi&s;ite in order to their pre&s;erving them|&s;elves and property, from the hands of vio|lence. In this view therefore, war though connected with blood and carnage, is legi|timated. The principles of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation prove it lawful; the voice of rea&s;on pro|claims it expedient, and the law of God demands it as a duty; whil&s;t a mo&s;t tre|mendous <HI>cur&s;e is denounced again&s;t &s;uch as do this work of the Lord deceitfully, and keep back their &s;words from blood</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Jerem. xlviii.10.</NOTE>.

of military &s;kill; for the religion of Je&s;us, the laws of God, do not permit us to invade the rights of others, or di&s;turb them in the quiet enjoyment of their ju&s;tly ac|quired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. But, ina&s;much as the pre&s;ent corrupt temper of mankind can give us no rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of an entire ex|emption from their violence, and as the mo&s;t probable way to prevent the execution of their wicked de&s;igns, is to appeal to the &s;word, and be in a capacity to repre&s;s their in&s;olence, and repel force by force; hence knowledge in the arts and policy of war, is a very de&s;irable accompli&s;hment: And truly happy is the condition of that people, who are &s;o prepared for the reception of an ap|proaching enemy, as to be free from pre|vailing fears on the occa&s;ion, and have well grounded confidence of &s;ucce&s;s in battle. This was the happy condition of <HI>David</HI> in my text: On what occa&s;ion he penned the P&s;alm is uncertain: Some think, when he was per&s;ecuted by <HI>Saul</HI>; others, when he was forced to fly from <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI>; and others again, on the occa&s;ion of his being deliver|ed from the hands of <HI>I&s;hbibenob,</HI> one of the &s;ons of a Giant, who came upon him and thought to have killed him, and probably would have done &s;o, had not Abi&s;hai &s;tepped in to his relief <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">2d Saml. xxi.16.</NOTE>: But be the occa&s;ion what it would, we find it &s;peaks the language of

confidence, and a full a&s;&s;urance of victory in war, &s;hould it ever ri&s;e again&s;t him. This was not a groundle&s;s pre&s;umption, nor the effect of pride and &s;elf-conceit; it was not an enthu&s;ia&s;tic impre&s;&s;ion, nor an evidence of a ra&s;h and fool-hardy &s;pirit; but the re&s;ult of pa&s;t experience: His knowledge and dexterity in the u&s;e of arms, his own bra|very and prowe&s;s, the goodne&s;s of his cau&s;e and the favour of heaven towards him, fill|ed him with the&s;e hopes. The words then may well furni&s;h out to us the foundation of an enquiry concerning the things that are requi&s;ite to in&s;pire a people with cou|rage, and rea&s;onable hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in an engagement with an ho&s;t that either has, or may encamp again&s;t them. You will give your candid attention then, whil&s;t I go on to enumerate tho&s;e things that are nece&s;&s;a|ry for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> The ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e is, in this view e&s;&s;ential: They who are believers in the righteous, &s;uperintending providence of God, mu&s;t needs have but very &s;lender hopes of prevailing in battle, if they know them|&s;elves to be engaged in the &s;upport of an unrighteous claim: If the increa&s;ing their own power and dominion, the aggrandize|ment of them&s;elves and families, and the gratification of the pa&s;&s;ions of avarice, am|bition or revenge, be the only motives of
<PB N="8" REF="013789_0007_0F91AED7EA140C88">
their commencing ho&s;tilities, and the only objects they are pur&s;uing in oppo&s;ition to the peace and happine&s;s, the liberty and vir|tue of tho&s;e whom they invade; then, me|thinks, their own hearts mu&s;t mi&s;give them; and they can rea&s;onably expect no favour, no countenance, no &s;upport from that up|right Governor of the world who loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s, and is particularly concerned for the happine&s;s of his great family of mankind: Should they flatter them&s;elves with hopes of &s;ucce&s;s from their &s;uperior numbers, or greater acquaintance with mi|litary di&s;cipline, yet they cannot fail to re|flect, that God is able to arm the elements and the whole ho&s;t of heaven again&s;t them, to impart wi&s;dom to the &s;imple, knowledge to the ignorant, &s;trength to the weak, and courage to the faint-hearted; and thus to cau&s;e victory to declare in favour of op|pre&s;&s;ed innocence. <HI>This,</HI> the mo&s;t authen|tic hi&s;tory in the world teaches us he has done in time pa&s;t, and <HI>this</HI> &s;uch unrighteous oppre&s;&s;ors have rea&s;on to fear he may do again; if in a natural way, deliverance cannot be procured for tho&s;e who are &s;tand|ing up in defence of their own righteous cau&s;e: The invaders therefore of the rights of their fellow-men mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have many fore bodings of ill-&s;ucce&s;s, and ju&s;t fears of being repul&s;ed, even when engaged

in conte&s;t with a people le&s;s in number and inferior in &s;kill to them&s;elves: Whereas on the other hand, the goodne&s;s of a people's cau&s;e not only gives hope that God will fa|vor and &s;ucceed them in it; <HI>that the Cap|tain of the Lord's ho&s;t will be for them,</HI> and <HI>fight their battles,</HI> but al&s;o in&s;pires them with great zeal and re&s;olution in the defence of it. What confidence mu&s;t that people have of protection and victory, when the intere&s;t of religion, the honor of God, the happine&s;s of them&s;elves, and the welfare of unborn millions, are the only object of their contention? And what an amazing unbro|ken courage, what an invincible heroi&s;m, will po&s;&s;e&s;s the brea&s;ts of tho&s;e who fight <HI>pro aris et focis,</HI> for their religion, their wives and children, their liberty and happi|ne&s;s, in &s;hort, for every thing that is good and great, venerable and &s;acred. <HI>This</HI> will give &s;pirit to the lifele&s;s, courage to the ti|mid, invention to the dull, and ardour to the phlegmatic. In &s;uch a cau&s;e as this, per|&s;ons of all ages and profe&s;&s;ions will chear|fully engage. The hu&s;band-man <HI>will beat his plough-&s;hare into &s;words, and the vine-dre&s;&s;er his pruning-hook into &s;pears, and the weak,</HI> forgetting his natural embicility, <HI>will &s;ay I am &s;trong</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Joel ii.10.</NOTE>.

<P N="2">2<HI>d.</HI> A &s;uitable body of troops to &s;tand up in defence of this good cau&s;e is another thing nece&s;&s;ary. On the goodne&s;s of their cau&s;e a wi&s;e people will not alone rely, though God can deliver, and has done &s;o, without any vi&s;ible means, yet his u&s;ual me|thod is to effect his purpo&s;es by the in&s;tru|mentality of &s;econd cau&s;es: Therefore to neglect the natural means of &s;afety, whil&s;t we have them in our power, is not confid|ing <HI>in,</HI> but ra&s;hly tempting and boldly pre|&s;uming <HI>on</HI> the power and goodne&s;s of God. He expects that we u&s;e all lawful methods in our own power for our &s;ecurity and de|fence; after which we may leave our righ|teous cau&s;e with heaven, in humble hope that he will uphold and protect it. Now to have provided a &s;uitable body of militia to with&s;tand the ho&s;t that encampeth again&s;t us, is one of tho&s;e methods which we ought to take for our &s;ecurity: And that this mi|litary body may be &s;uch as to give a people rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of victory, it &s;hould be circum&s;tanced in the following manner: <HI>It &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of a re&s;pectable number of able-bodied, effective men</HI>: Though one &s;ome|times cha&s;es a thou&s;and, and two puts ten thou&s;and to flight, yet this mu&s;t be

owing to the miraculous interpo&s;ition of Pro|vidence, and what happens be&s;ides the com|mon and ordinary cour&s;e of things:&mdash;For a large and very numerous army I would not be under&s;tood to plead; becau&s;e &s;uch an one commonly rather di&s;&s;erves than helps the cau&s;e; rather gives occa&s;ion to fear a defeat, than hope for victory: All pa&s;t experience confirms the truth of this: It is the unvaried language both of &s;acred and profane hi&s;tory, that overgrown armies have commonly been routed, thrown into confu|&s;ion and cut to pieces, by tho&s;e of a more moderate &s;ize, who were therefore more ea&s;ily governed and le&s;s unweildy. <HI>Abijah</HI> King of <HI>Judah</HI> with an army of four hun|dred thou&s;and men entered the field with <HI>Jereboam</HI> King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> with twice that number, and yet the former was victorious, &s;laying five hundred thou&s;and of the latter in one btttle <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">2d Chron. xiii.3, 17.</NOTE>. <HI>A&s;a</HI> King of Judah, having an army of five hundred and eighty thou|&s;and men, entirely routed an army of a mil|lion, brought again&s;t him by <HI>Zerah</HI> King of <HI>Cu&s;h</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">2d Chron. xiv.9.13.</NOTE>. So the immen&s;e army of <HI>Xerxes,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of between two and three millions was entirely defeated by forty thou&s;and <HI>Greeks.</HI> But though the&s;e in&s;tances prove that no advantage is to be expected from an over numerous ho&s;t; yet at the pre&s;ent day when it is not u&s;ual to carry &s;uch &s;u|pernumerary
<PB N="12" REF="013789_0011_0F91AEDBB7135998">
troops into the field, it is be&s;t to equal, or at lea&s;t not to fall much &s;hort of tho&s;e again&s;t whom we appear&punc; It is of &s;till greater importance towards in&s;uring &s;ucce&s;s, that the troops &s;hould be valiant and courageous, able of body, and capable of enduring the fatigues of a campaign. And notwith&s;tanding the advantage a <HI>&s;tand|ing army</HI> may, on &s;ome account, have over a <HI>militia,</HI> yet the&s;e <HI>latter</HI> may, with more &s;ecurity be depended on than the <HI>former</HI>; becau&s;e being compo&s;ed of men who have had their &s;inews &s;trung, their limbs invigor|ated, and bodies hardened by daily labor, they will commonly exceed the former in &s;trength and courage; and fighting for their e&s;tates, families and religion, will have every po&s;&s;ible inducement to exert the mo&s;t &s;trenuous efforts in their defence.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>this militia &s;hould be well equipt with martial weapons, with proper arms, and &s;ufficient ammunition.</HI>&mdash;De&s;titute of the&s;e, no re&s;i&s;tance can be made, nor at|chievement performed again&s;t the advancing foe. <HI>The&s;e</HI> are as nece&s;&s;ary to the proper &s;oldier to enable him to with&s;tand a well furni&s;hed ho&s;t, as the panoply of God is to the &s;piritual &s;oldier, who without it cannot expect <HI>to &s;tand again&s;t the wiles of the de|vil, or quench his fiery darts. David</HI> could not have uttered him&s;elf as he does in the

text, unle&s;s he knew that <HI>he</HI> and his <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> were well provided with weapons of war: For what probability of &s;ucce&s;s can there po&s;&s;ibly be in an engagement, if to all the modern in&s;truments of death, we have no|thing to oppo&s;e but our naked bodies, or u&s;ele&s;s arms, as incapable of annoying as they. Con&s;cious of the di&s;advantage ari&s;ing from the want of military weapons, the <HI>Phili&s;tines took away all the &s;miths, through|out the land of I&s;rael,</HI> le&s;t the <HI>Hebrews &s;hould make them&s;elves &s;words or &s;pears,</HI> and thus be in a po&s;ture of defence; and at another time, <HI>when there was not a &s;word, or &s;pear to be found among forty thou&s;and in I&s;rael,</HI> they fell an ea&s;y prey into the hands of their enemies. Further, <HI>they &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of military &s;kill</HI>;&mdash;knowledge in the art of war among civilized nations has been much cultivated, and by &s;ome of them carried to perfection: To go therefore into the field, in order to face a veteran, well di&s;ciplined &s;oldiery, rude and ignorant of this &s;cience, is the direct way to &s;acrifice our lives and betray the cau&s;e in which we are engaged. More has often times been done by military &s;kill, than by the advantage of &s;uperior numbers and prowe&s;s. In battle with bar|barous forces, this is an accompli&s;hment not &s;o e&s;&s;ential. But with tho&s;e by whom war is &s;tudied as a &s;cience, and held as a profe&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="14" REF="013789_0013_0F91AEDD7274A040">
it is in vain to engage, unle&s;s we al&s;o are well ver&s;ed in the modern manoeuvres of the &s;ame. They that are but &s;uperfici|ally acquainted with hi&s;tory, know that the mo&s;t glorious exploits have been atchieved by means of martial di&s;cipline. By this, in a great mea&s;ure, the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> &s;ol|diers made their arms triumphant over the barbarous nations of the globe. This, par|ticularly, extended the Roman Empire to the mo&s;t diffu&s;ive limits, enabled her to give law to millions, and made her the mi&s;tre&s;s of the world. This acquired to <HI>Julius Cae|&s;ar</HI> the fal&s;e glory of having &s;lain more than twelve hundred thou&s;and men in his wars: For had he been de&s;titute of this &s;kill, he could not have made &s;uch mighty ha|vock; the &s;trength and courage, the pa|tience and valour of his troops frequently meeting an equal match from the nations with whom they contended. To un|der&s;tand the u&s;e of the gun, the &s;word and the bayonet; to know how to draw up an army in the mo&s;t advantageous form for battle, to be expert in the different evolutions, &s;o as to be able to rally a broken &s;quadron; to place a battallion in an ad|vantageous po&s;t, to detach a party to &s;up|ply the place of tho&s;e that may have been outdone, and to reinforce &s;uch as are mani|fe&s;tly too weak to &s;tand the &s;hock that is
<PB N="15" REF="013789_0014_0F91AEDDEDF4D4E0">
brought again&s;t them; to know how to perform the&s;e &s;everal manoeuvres readily, without mi&s;take or blunder, will give to an army a very great advantage in a field en|gagement, and without this knowledge our confidence in them can be but &s;mall. La&s;tly, <HI>they &s;hould be accu&s;tomed to military &s;ubor|dination.</HI> To have able Generals, prudent and experienced commanders, and then im|plicity to obey them, is the beauty and per|fection, the life and &s;afety of an army. Of this obedience and &s;ubordination the regu|lar troops are an excellent example. It is &s;urpri&s;ing to ob&s;erve to what a pitch they have carried their ideas of order, through the influence of &s;evere di&s;cipline, and long continued cu&s;tom. The common &s;oldiers are all obedience to tho&s;e in command. And among&s;t the officers them&s;elves there is a ju&s;t gradation, each inferior one &s;trictly ob&s;erving the orders of tho&s;e above him. Every one is fixed in his po&s;t, and yields &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e that are in places of &s;u|perior command. Hence the &s;upreme offi|cer regulates the whole. He, like the &s;oul in the natural body, puts in motion every member; and all the different parts, which otherwi&s;e would cla&s;h and interfere, depend|ing ultimately on his influence, are made one harmonious body, all tending in their re&s;pective places to one grand point, with|out
<PB N="16" REF="013789_0015_0F91AEDEC4046D58">
confu&s;ion. Whereas, if there were many ma&s;ters in an army, all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of co-ordinate power, this would ob&s;truct each &s;alutary plan, and breed de&s;truction to the whole. From a con&s;ideration hereof, it has ever been e&s;teemed an important point to maintain this &s;ubordination; and for the maintenance of it no di&s;cipline has been thought too &s;evere. Of &s;uch moment did the ancient warlike <HI>Romans</HI> view it, that we have in&s;tances of per&s;ons being puni&s;hed with death for fighting contrary to order, even though &s;ucce&s;s attended their arms. This indeed was a puni&s;hment di&s;proportion|ate to the offence: However, all mu&s;t con|cede that without the pre&s;ervation of <HI>go|vernment</HI> and <HI>order</HI> in an army no &s;ucce&s;s is to be expected again&s;t tho&s;e who religiou&s;ly uphold it. I come now to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="3">3dly. That the righteou&s;ne&s;s of a people's character is another thing nece&s;&s;ary in order to their being confident of &s;ucce&s;s in war. It is evident that under the righteous go|vernment of Jehovah, tho&s;e who have ap|peared in defence of a ju&s;t cau&s;e, have &s;ome|times been defeated. People have been de|prived both of civil and religious liberty by the prevailing efforts of an oppre&s;&s;ive enemy; and this has been permitted to take place by God as a puni&s;hment for their di&s;|obedience, ingratitude and unfruitfulne&s;s.

<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> What has been &s;aid, may &s;erve as a caution to all people not to engage in a war that is manife&s;tly unju&s;t. Every one is &s;o that is entered upon with a view to de|prive a nation or &s;ociety of men of their ju&s;t rights and privileges; to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them of their property and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and to bring them into a &s;tate unfriendly to virtue, re|ligion and happine&s;s. It is highly danger|ous and criminal to take up arms in &s;uch a cau&s;e as this. Dangerous, as &s;uch per&s;ons put them&s;elves out of the protection of hea|ven, and can hope for no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>the God of armies</HI>; but on the contrary, have rea&s;on to think that he will be again&s;t them, frown upon all their enterprizes, di&s;concert their mea&s;ures, and cau&s;e the <HI>mi&s;chiefs they have framed for others, to fall upon their own heads.</HI> Be&s;ides, they have rea&s;on to ex|pect the mo&s;t vigorous oppo&s;ition from tho&s;e whom they attempt to oppre&s;s: Cri|minal, becau&s;e &s;hould they prove &s;ucce&s;sful, they are chargeable with the guilt of mur|der, in the &s;ight of heaven, for every per|&s;on that is &s;lain by them in the defence of their ju&s;t rights and liberties. If the cau&s;e of the war be ju&s;t, every per&s;on that is de&s;|troyed when &s;tanding up in oppo&s;ition to it, is righteou&s;ly &s;lain, and <HI>his blood will be re|quired at his own hands</HI>; but if it be other|wi&s;e,

they that are &s;lain, will hereafter <HI>ri&s;e in judgment again&s;t</HI> their de&s;troyers, and will <HI>condemn them:</HI> Whereas, if on the con|trary, they them&s;elves &s;hould fall in battle, being killed in the &s;upport of an unrighte|ous claim, they will be in danger <HI>of going down to hell with their weapons of war</HI><NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxii.27.</NOTE>. It is &s;incerely to be wi&s;hed, that at the pre|&s;ent day, when ambition and avarice are &s;o frequently the only motives for fighting, this matter were properly con&s;idered by all. Then, methinks, we &s;hould not have our ears &s;o often &s;aluted by the unwelcome &s;ounds occa&s;ioned by the cla&s;hing of &s;words, the report of cannon, and other in&s;truments of death.

So much depends on the military character of a people, that they cannot rationally de|pend on the pre&s;ervation of their rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions without it. When they &s;it carele&s;s and &s;ecure, neglecting the nece&s;&s;ary means of defence; when no provi&s;ion is made by them to re&s;i&s;t the incroachments of their ambitious and a&s;piring neighbours; when a martial &s;pirit flags, and the know|ledge of arms remains uncultivated, then, like <HI>Lai&s;h</HI> of old, they may be ea&s;ily plun|dered and &s;ubdued, and indeed it is highly probable they will be &s;o.
