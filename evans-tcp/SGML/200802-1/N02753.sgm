<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Chri&s;tian Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A<HI>S I have often review'd with Wonder, &s;o I take Leave on the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion thus publickly to men|tion with Gratitude, the &s;ignal Conduct of Divine Providence in bringing me at fir&s;t among you, while I was in a manner an utter</HI> Stranger <HI>to you all, and when by rea&s;on of my young Years, and apprehended</HI> Unfit|ne&s;s <HI>for &s;o important a Station, I could not entertain the lea&s;t Expectation of &s;uch a Preferment. And the uncommon</HI> Una|nimity <HI>that (as you may remember) attended your Invita|tion and Call, was what I have thought a very happy Circum&s;tance of my Settlement, and do often look back upon with equal Plea&s;ure and Surprize. This indeed was one peculiar Encouragement I had to give up</HI> my own <HI>Inclina|tions, which were not to fix in the Mini&s;try &s;o very early.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have Rea&s;on to admire your Candour toward me, while I have been with many Infirmities &s;erving in the Go&s;pel among you: And I de&s;ire to take a thankful Notice of the Favour of God in continuing us together thus long in &s;o much of mutual peace and Sati&s;faction; now the</HI> 14<HI>th Year</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Feb. 1716, 17. By Vote of the Church I enter'd on &s;tated Preaching.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>I have &s;ometimes very anxious Thoughts of Heart upon that of the Apo&s;tle,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 2. I knew a man in Chri&s;t above fourteen years ago.&mdash;<HI>Happy the Mini&s;ter, happy the Profe&s;&s;or, that hath &s;uch A&s;&s;urance of his &s;aving Union to Chri&s;t! And happy the People, who have tho&s;e to te&s;tify the Go&s;pel of the Grace of God among them, who are vitally united to Chri&s;t, and</HI> have the Witne&s;s in them&s;elves!</P>
<P>IT <HI>has always been very affecting to me to con&s;ider what</HI> Men of God <HI>they were, in who&s;e place I &s;ucceed. This Church of Chri&s;t has been di&s;tingui&s;h'd with a Succe&s;&s;ion of burning and &s;hining Lights; Pa&s;tors and Teachers eminent for their Gifts, and no le&s;s eminent for their Graces and Experience in all the My&s;teries of the Divine Life;</HI> Wil&s;on, Cotton, Norton, Davenport, <HI>&amp;c. The&s;e
<PB REF="003280_0004_0FF03C7C69393CE8">
Venerable Fathers were in their Day very much</HI> New-England'<HI>s Strength and Glory; and in each of them this Church enjoy'd a peculiar Trea&s;ure. I have often blu&s;h'd and been full of Confu&s;ion within my &s;elf, from a Con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of my own comparative Nothingne&s;s: Yet I hope the Reflection has &s;ometimes been a Help to me in my Work, to direct and animate my Mini&s;trations among you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I have taken a &s;ingular Delight in reading the</HI> Lives <HI>of my excellent Predece&s;&s;ors; &s;o many of which we &s;ee in Print: have often thought I cou'd de&s;ire no better Patterns to copy after; and made it my Heart's De&s;ire and Prayer to God, That I might by the Grace of Chri&s;t be principl'd and &s;pirit|ed, as they were; that I might have the like Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t with me, as they had; that the Work they &s;o happily began, might not mi&s;carry in my hands.</HI></P>
<P>ALAS! <HI>there is among us a vi&s;ible</HI> Decline <HI>of Religion in the power and practice of it, and not the ancient Succe&s;s of Go&s;pel-Ordinances. Sure I am, It becomes us all, both Mini&s;ters and People, humbly to inquire into the Grounds and Cau&s;es hereof.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I readily take to my &s;elf</HI> my <HI>part of the Blame, as being &s;adly &s;en&s;ible of many Defects in me, with regard both to tho&s;e Abilities and Graces, which form the Character, and direct the wi&s;e and holy Management, that is nece&s;&s;ary in tho&s;e that wou'd by their Example, as well as Preaching, win Souls to Chri&s;t, and</HI> lead the Way <HI>in &s;eeking the Kingdom of Heaven. Verily the be&s;t of us all need mer|ciful Allowances, before we can claim the Character and Reward of good and faithful Servants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. O for the Application of the Blood of Sprinkling, that I may be made accepted in the</HI> BELOVED! <HI>And for the Supply of the Spirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that I may watch in all things and make full Proof of my Mini&s;try! I earne&s;tly ask the Help of your fervent Prayers for me (as al&s;o for my worthy Brother and Collegue) that the Sins of my Mini&s;try may be done away by the Blood of Chri&s;t, and that the Succe&s;s of it may be &s;ecured by his powerful Ble&s;&s;ing: that Chri&s;t our Ma&s;ter may be with us continually, in the Study and in the Pulpit, and in all our Conver&s;ation, Vi&s;its, and pri|vate Labours among you.</HI></P>
<P>AND <HI>we be&s;eech you (Brethren) in the fear of God to con&s;ider what Defects there are on</HI> your <HI>part, that may be a further Ob&s;truction to the Succe&s;s of the Go&s;pel in this once flouri&s;hing Church. "Let your Mini&s;ters have their

ju&s;t Share of Cen&s;ure: Neverthele&s;s we are per&s;uaded, you do not think the whole Blame lies at our Doors. Even the</HI> SON <HI>of</HI> GOD <HI>him&s;elf, of whom it was witne&s;&s;ed, That</HI> never man &s;pake <HI>or liv'd</HI> like him; <HI>yet meets with little Succe&s;s, and finds him&s;elf con&s;trained to throw back Men's ju&s;t Condemnation on their own Heads,</HI> Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life".</P>
<P>BE <HI>much in &s;erious Self-Examination, to know what on your part hinders the Go&s;pel; and be much in Prayer, and in the U&s;e of all proper Methods, that the Power of Godline&s;s may be revived among us. Let Go&s;pel-Truths, Go&s;pel Order, and Go&s;pel-Wor&s;hip be precious in your Eyes. Stand fa&s;t in the Liberty, wherewith Chri&s;t hath made you free: and keep the Ordinances as they have been delivered to you, in their primitive Purity, without &s;uffering any Alloy of hu|man Inventions. If &s;ome from an Antichri&s;tian Spirit wou'd impo&s;e upon you in Matters of Religion, remember the&s;e are &s;acred to God and Con&s;cience; and</HI> be not the Servants of Men. <HI>As we are a &s;piritual Corporation, let us take Care to exerci&s;e and reverence the holy Di&s;cipline that Chri&s;t hath in&s;tituted; Charitable to receive all vi&s;ible Saints, cautious to admit only &s;uch, and faithful to expel &s;candalous Sinners from our Communion. Purge out the old Leaven, that ye may be a new Lump. O let the Duty of Brotherly Admonition, &s;o much neglected in this Day of Degeneracy, be re&s;tored to a &s;erious and univer&s;al Practice; and yet let none, under a &s;pecious pretence of lamenting others Sins, act the</HI> Bu&s;y-Body, <HI>as the manner of &s;ome is, whi&s;per|ing Things which they ought not, to the prejudice of their Neighbours Reputation, the great Hurt of Religion, and the manife&s;t Forfeiture of all Preten&s;ions to a Spirit of Cha|rity and Brotherly Kindne&s;s. Watch over one another, for good, and not Evil. Provoke one another to Love and good Works. Exhort one another daily, left any of you be hard|ned through the Deceitfulne&s;s of Sin. Be not Partakers of other Men's Sins: but by bearing due Te&s;timony again&s;t them, deliver your own Souls. Such as are Heads of Fa|milies, O take a religious Care of the Youth committed to your Charge: And Children, &s;ee that you obey your Pa|rents in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>IT'<HI>s a day abounding with Temptations, to our young People in &s;pecial, to de&s;ert the Intere&s;t of pure Religion, and betray the Cau&s;e of God, in which our Forefathers were engag'd. O let us do all we can to fortify and fix
<PB REF="003280_0006_0FF03C800A552058">
them, and to recover &s;uch as are fallen from their Stedfa&s;tne&s;s. What greater Joy than to &s;ee our Children walking in the Truth! Let us labour their early Conver&s;ion to God, and u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible Means to form them to Virtue, to fur|ni&s;h and di&s;po&s;e them to be active Ble&s;&s;ings to their Generation. And thou</HI> Solomon, <HI>my Son, know thou the God of thy Father, &amp; &s;erve him with a perfect Heart &amp; with a willing Mind: for the Lord &s;earcheth all Hearts. If thou &s;eek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou for&s;ake him, tremble le&s;t be ca&s;t thee off for ever.</HI></P>
<P>IN <HI>a word, let us glorify God for his &s;ignal Appearances in the days of our Forefathers; and con&s;ider them as Obli|gations on us, who reap the happy fruits thereof, to adhere with Steadine&s;s and Zeal to the &s;piritual and exalted</HI> Ends <HI>of that great Undertaking, which brought them over to</HI> America. <HI>Let us always maintain a peculiar E&s;teem for the Memory of our pious Progenitors, and train up our Children in the &s;ame Veneration: be often telling them of the excellent Character and Spirit of our Forefathers, their Errand into this Wilderne&s;s, the Covenant wherein they've bound their Po&s;terity to the Lord, and their many ardent Prayers for &s;ucceeding Generations. As we are building on the Foundations they have laid for us, and rejoycing in many de&s;irable Re&s;ults of their Pains and Prayers, &s;urely it be|comes us never to mention their Names but with Di&s;tinctions of Re&s;pect, as the Fathers of</HI> New-England. <HI>And let us &s;ee to it that we act and behave worthily of our noble De&s;cent: El&s;e this will turn for a Te&s;timony again&s;t us.</HI></P>
<P>STAND <HI>ye in the Ways, and &s;ee, and ask for the old 'Paths, the good Way, and walk therein: and ye &s;hall find Re&s;t for your Souls Remember them that have had the Rule over you, who have &s;poken to you the good Word of God. And be ye Followers of them, who thro' Faith and Patience inherit the Promi&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI> promote the&s;e excellent Purpo&s;es, is my Aim in the following Di&s;cour&s;e: which I now put into your Hand for your &s;erious Peru&s;al, and commend to the Ble&s;&s;ing of</HI> GOD <HI>for the de&s;ired Succe&s;s.

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>MATTH. XIII. 31, 32.</BIBL>
<Q><P>Another Parable put he forth unto them, &s;aying, <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven is like to a Grain of Mu&s;tard-Seed, which a man took and &s;owed in his field.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Which indeed is the lea&s;t of all &s;eeds: but when it is grown, it is the greate&s;t among herbs, and becometh a Tree: &s;o that the Birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE may very fitly intitle the Chapter before us a Collection of Parables. No le&s;s than eight are here record|ed; where, in Language borrow'd from Things earthly, our Saviour di&s;cour&s;es of Matters &s;piritual and heavenly. This way of teaching by Similitudes
<PB REF="003280_0008_0FF03C848100D600">
was what the <HI>Jews</HI> had always been accu&s;tom'd to: and our Lord in the u&s;e of this Method conde&s;cend|ed to the Capacity and Genius of the People of that day. His Parables are all the mo&s;t wi&s;ely cho&s;en, to &s;erve their re&s;pective purpo&s;es. 'Tis both plea|&s;ant and profitable to meditate upon them.</P>
<P>THE &s;cope of this Parable of the <HI>Grain of Mu&s;tard-Seed</HI> is to &s;hew how the Go&s;pel-Church (to which the Stile of <HI>the Kingdom of Heaven</HI> is here and often el&s;ewhere given) &s;hould from very low and &s;mall Beginnings, gradually increa&s;e and grow, and at length ri&s;e up to an admirable Degree of Strength, Extent and Glory.</P>
<P>THE Text wou'd naturally lead me to di&s;|cour&s;e of the State of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> in the Apo&s;to|lick Age; <Q>which appear'd at fir&s;t as a little incon&s;iderable <HI>Seed,</HI> but did &s;oon &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> up, and grow into a &s;tately <HI>Tree;</HI> did like the Tree of Life in the mid&s;t of the Garden of God, &s;pread its &s;alutary Branches far and wide, &amp; has taken &s;o deep and firm a Root, that all the Powers of Hell, with all their Storms and Underminings, &s;hall never be able to prevail again&s;t it.</Q>&mdash;But tho' &s;uch a Di&s;cour&s;e might be of excellent Service, it's out of the way of my <HI>pre&s;ent De&s;ign;</HI> which is to bring your Reflections nearer home, and employ them in a brief Recognition of the Primitive State, Beginning and Progre&s;s of the Kingdom of Chri&s;t in <HI>this place.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT determin'd my Thoughts to &s;uch a Sub|ject, was a View to that ob&s;ervable Circum&s;tance of the Week now opening to us, That it is the Period of <HI>One HUNDRED</HI> Years &s;ince the fir&s;t Gather|ing of this ancient, <HI>Church,</HI> and laying the Founda|tions of Go&s;pel-Order here, by a &s;olemn <HI>Covenant;</HI>

<P>Now as it has fallen out in the Cour&s;e of our publick reading the Scriptures, that &s;o &s;utable a Text &s;hou'd occur for the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion, I have been ready to interpret this as an Intimation of Pro|vidence to me, to take &s;ome &s;pecial Notice of the remarkable Period before us, and lead you into &s;ome Meditations adapted thereto. The Language of Heaven to us at this day &s;eems to be as in I&s;a. 51. 1, 2. <HI>Hearken to me, ye that follow after righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, ye that &s;eek the Lord: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged. Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you; for I called him alone, and ble&s;&s;ed him, and increa&s;ed him.</HI> And when I reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on the Wonder-working Providence of God, which planted our <HI>Zion</HI> and has e&s;tabli&s;h'd it hitherto, I have thought She might very fitly take up the Language of P&s;al. 40th.&mdash;<HI>He brought me
<PB N="4" REF="003280_0010_0FF03C8866BA2F40">
up out of an horrible Pit, and &s;et my Feet upon a Rock: and he hath put a new Song in my Mouth.&mdash;Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful Works which thou ha&s;t done, and thy Thoughts to us-ward, they cannot be reckoned up in Order unto thee; if I would declare and &s;peak of them, they are more than can be number'd.</HI> A Train of marvellous Operations of Divine Power and Grace prepar'd the Way to the Plantation of the Kingdom of GOD in this place; and a Succe&s;&s;ion of illu&s;trious Events attended the Progre&s;s thereof. <HI>O &s;ing unto the Lord a new Song: He hath made known his &s;alvation; his Righteou&s;ne&s;s hath he openly &s;hewed in the &s;ight of the Heathen: all the Ends of the Earth have &s;een the Salvation of our GOD. One Generation &s;hall prai&s;e thy Works to another: I will &s;peak of the Glory of thy Kingdom, and declare thy loving kindne&s;s, O God, in the mid&s;t of thy Temple. Thy Saints &s;hall ble&s;s thee; they &s;hall abundantly utter the Memory of thy great Goodne&s;s, and &s;ing aloud of thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s. My Mouth &s;hall &s;peak the Prai&s;e of the Lord: and let all Fle&s;h ble&s;s his holy Name for ever.</HI></P>
<P>I will not pretend to critically trace the Begin|ning and Improvement of this Work of GOD in all its &s;everal &s;teps; for that were to write a Volume of Hi&s;tory: But &s;hall only give you the more gene|ral Hints, proper to have place in a Sermon, to the End I may excite your Gratitude and encourage your Confidence toward GOD, the Hope of our Fa|thers.</P>
<P>OUR Text points out the Method I propo&s;e to my &s;elf in treating this Subject, which is&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. To call your Thoughts back to the <HI>Original</HI> of this religious Settlement, and &s;hew the <HI>Smallne&s;s</HI> of our Beginning.</P>

<P>BY the grace of GOD &s;uch Pro&s;perity attended tho&s;e glorious Attempts, that in a few years the Re|formation made its progre&s;s thro' a great part of <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> About the year 1526 &s;everal States in <HI>Ger|many,</HI> that were zealous for the reforming Intere&s;t, united in a <HI>Prote&s;tation</HI> again&s;t the Decrees of a Po|pi&s;h Diet; and upon that account the Reformers have ever &s;ince gone under the Name of <HI>Prote&s;tants.</HI></P>

<P>AGAIN, The <HI>Pre&s;ence</HI> of Chri&s;t with our Fathers in this Land was the Fountain of all their <HI>&s;piritual</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> Happine&s;s and Excellence. It was a plenti|ful Effu&s;ion of the HOLY SPIRIT, that turn'd this Wilderne&s;s into a fruitful Field, and gave it a Glory above that of <HI>Lebanon,</HI> and above the Excel|lency of <HI>Carmel</HI> and <HI>Sharon.</HI> He appointed it for a Fold of Flocks; and here as the Lord their Shepherd, he cau&s;ed them to lie down in green Pa&s;tures, re&s;tored their Souls, and led them in the Paths of Righteou&s;ne&s;s for his Name's &s;ake. 'Twas the Pre&s;ence of the Spirit of Chri&s;t with them, in their Families, Courts, Schools, and Churches, that &s;o gloriou&s;ly &s;ucceeded the Means for increa&s;ing of Knowledge, and promoting of Order, Peace, Ju&s;tice, Sobriety, and Religion. Then that word was ful|filled, P&s;al. 72. 6, 7. <HI>He &s;hall come down like Rain upon the mowen Gra&s;s, as Showres that water the Ground&mdash;There &s;hall be a handful of Corn in the Earth upon the top of the Mountains, the fruit thereof &s;hall &s;hake like</HI> Lebanon, <HI>and they of the City &s;hall flouri&s;h like Gra&s;s of the Field.</HI> The influxive Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t gave an admirable Energy to the Seed of the Go&s;pel here &s;own; that an handful of it produc'd a mighty Harve&s;t to the Glory of Chri&s;t. 'Twas the <HI>Fruit of the Spirit;</HI> intirely owing to his concur|rent Influences: without who&s;e powerful Ble&s;&s;ing all human In&s;truments and &s;econd Cau&s;es have no Significance.</P>
<P>BUT tho' all their Pro&s;perity is to be re&s;olv'd ulti|mately into the Power of the Lord pre&s;ent with them: Yet it may be ob&s;erv'd,</P>

<P>IT might be premis'd here, The Flouri&s;hing of Religion among our Fathers had a powerful Effi|cacy
<PB N="21" REF="003280_0027_0FF03CB2D08C5400">
as the be&s;t <HI>natural</HI> Means, to promote their univer&s;al Pro&s;perity, Peace, and external Glory. For as the Wi&s;e Man ob&s;erves, Prov. 14. <HI>The Fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life:&mdash;Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a Nation.</HI>&mdash;And let me &s;peak freely, without offence to any, The fir&s;t Beginners of this Plantation, as to the Body of them, were an excel|lent Set of real and living Chri&s;tians, who felt the power of vital Religion in their Hearts; and not &s;uch as de&s;ir'd only to make a fair &s;hew in the fle&s;h.</P>
<P>DOUBTLESS indeed they had a Mixture of <HI>fal&s;e</HI> Profe&s;&s;ors among them: but the&s;e being aw'd by the prevailing Example of &s;erious Godline&s;s and the common Zeal again&s;t Sin, were generally careful to pre&s;erve an Appearance of Religion in their Lives; &s;o that in the fir&s;t days of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> all Iniquity was forc'd to hide its head: it fled the open Light, it &s;ought for Shelter in Darkne&s;s, and lurk'd privily in &s;ecret places: while Virtue was triumphant, and Religion reign'd every where, in the Conver&s;ation, Language and Actions of the Ge|nerality.&mdash;It mu&s;t further be ob&s;erv'd, as to the worthie&s;t of our Fathers, they were <HI>but Men;</HI> in a State of Imperfection; and therefore &s;ubject to Temptations and &s;inful Infirmities: And <HI>&s;ome</HI> in our be&s;t times might be of too rigid and &s;evere a Temper, have le&s;s Candour and more Heat with relation to certain Modalities and minute points of Church-Order, than became them; and as one might be of too levelling Principles, &s;o another of too clo&s;e and narrow a Spirit, and not liberally e|nough di&s;pos'd towards the Servants of the Publick. <HI>Some</HI> I &s;ay, among the fir&s;t and be&s;t Generation of this People, I readily concede, might be deficient and reprovable on &s;uch heads as the&s;e: Yet even <HI>they</HI> were in general Men of an excellent Spirit, and in other regards appear'd with &s;hining Characters of the Divine Image upon them. But many other&s;

there were, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their Graces and Virtues, without tho&s;e their Di&s;temper'd Frames.</P>
<P>THERE were among them many Plants of Re|nown, Trees of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;ome of the choice&s;t in the whole Garden of Chri&s;t: and their Tran&s;|plantation from <HI>Britain</HI> to <HI>New-England</HI> did but add to their Beauty, Verdure and Refinement. They flouri&s;h'd in this Soil, and multiply'd and brought forth abundantly the Fruits of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, which are by Je&s;us Chri&s;t to the Prai&s;e of GOD.

<P>AND then the excellent Virtues, which in a flou|ri&s;hing State of Religion, were continually and al|mo&s;t univer&s;ally in Practice, contributed by a ne|ce&s;&s;ary and powerful Influence (<HI>in their own Na|ture</HI>) to the good Regulation of all kinds of So|cieties, to the Happine&s;s of Conver&s;ation, to the Security and Succe&s;s of Commerce, and an univer|&s;ally pro&s;perous State of Externals. By their In|du&s;try, Sobriety, Temperance, Mortification and Self-denial, Ju&s;tice, Integrity, and the like, they took a mo&s;t effectual Method to &s;ecure the Happi|ne&s;s of the &s;ocial Life, and prevented abundance of &s;uch Mi&s;chiefs and Di&s;orders, as are the natural Re&s;ults of tho&s;e Vices, which have been the Ruine of many a People.</P>

<P>I will give you my Thoughts under a few di&s;|tinct heads. Let it be con&s;ider'd,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>initial Generation of</HI> New-England <HI>was very much a</HI> Select <HI>&amp; a</HI> Puritanical <HI>People, in the proper &s;en&s;e of the Word.</HI> They were not (as to the Body of them) a promi&s;cuous and heterogeneous A&s;|&s;emblage: but in general of an uniform Character, agreeing in the mo&s;t excellent Qualities, Principles and Tempers; Chri&s;tians very much of the primi|tive Stamp. As one of our Worthies of the &s;econd Generation<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Stoughton</HI> in his Election-Sermon.</NOTE> has aptly expre&s;&s;ed it, "GOD <HI>&s;ifted</HI> a whole Nation that he might &s;end a <HI>choice Grain</HI> over into this Wilderne&s;s":&mdash;Seeking a godly Seed to &s;erve him, which &s;hould be counted before him for a Generation, even a Generation of his Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>IT was as little of a mixed Generation, in regard of their moral Character and religious Profe&s;&s;ion, that came over fir&s;t to <HI>New-England,</HI> as perhaps was ever known in the Earth. We read, when <HI>I&s;rael</HI> went up out of <HI>Egypt</HI> in &s;uch Pomp &amp; Glory, there went a <HI>mixt Multitude</HI> with them, who were a Snare and Di&s;grace to the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> and by a profane and vicious Example &s;pred Infection among them. But now the fir&s;t Generation of this People were very much a <HI>cho&s;en</HI> Generation: collected from a Variety of Places, and by a &s;trange Conduct of Divine Pro|vidence agreeing in the &s;ame Enterprize, to form a Plantation for Religion in this di&s;tant Part of the World, where they might wor&s;hip GOD according
<PB N="24" REF="003280_0030_0FF03CB9ADF7B340">
to the Light of their own Con&s;ciences, without the depraving Intermixture of human Inventions, and without Hazard of Per&s;ecution from the Bigots for papi&s;tical Ceremonies.</P>
<P>THE Genius or Spirit of the Age was &s;uch as in|di&s;po&s;ed the Generality to this &s;ort of Men, I mean the <HI>Puritans,</HI> who were de&s;pi&s;ed as hypocritical or ignorant Preci&s;ians; like the primitive Chri&s;tians, <HI>a Sect every where &s;poken again&s;t,</HI> and <HI>&s;uffering like things of their own Countrymen, even as they did of the</HI> Jews. And then the Remotene&s;s of the&s;e Ameri|can Shores, the Dangers of the Voyage, the Diffi|culties of a Settlement in an hideous Wa&s;te, and the former Defeat of &s;everal E&s;&s;ays for a Plantation here; the&s;e were Con&s;iderations that tended to &s;trike Terror upon the <HI>Worldly minded;</HI> in&s;omuch that few Men of that Complexion had Spirit enough to joyn in &s;o arduous and expenceful an Adventure. Few had the Heart and the Courage to leave their native Land, and plea&s;ant Habitations, Friends and Relatives, and exchange them for the Society of Strangers, and for Hard&s;hips, Straights &amp; Di&s;tre&s;&s;es in a foreign rude and wild Country; but tho&s;e who felt the power of that <HI>Faith,</HI> which worketh by Love, which over cometh the World, and is the Evidence of Things not &s;een, the Sub&s;tance of Things hoped for.</P>
<P><Q>THERE being a Royal Patent for the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ets</HI> Government, many out of <HI>England</HI> flocked into this Country almo&s;t every year, chiefly on the Account of <HI>Religion.</HI></Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>I.

<P>Now being &s;uch a &s;elect and unmix'd Genera|tion, this was one Rea&s;on of the extraordinary Flouri&s;hing and bright Appearance of Religion in that day.

<P>LET it further be ob&s;erv'd,</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY <HI>were, for the Generality, &s;uch as had been trained up in the School of</HI> Patience.</P>
<P>THE Body of the fir&s;t Comers were Men in their middle age or declining days; who had been inured to Sufferings for Righteou&s;ne&s;s-&s;ake: being among tho&s;e Puritan Reformers, who had for many years been witne&s;&s;ing again&s;t the Relicts of Popi&s;h Super|&s;titions in Prote&s;tant Wor&s;hip, and had been per&s;e|cuted for their Zeal in the Cau&s;e of a further Re|formation. <HI>Many a time have they afflicted me from my Youth, might</HI> I&s;rael <HI>&s;ay.</HI></P>
<P>Now their Afflictions being &s;anctify'd to 'em, they &s;erv'd to their E&s;tabli&s;hment and Growth in Grace: which made them the more meet and pre|par'd to conflict with the Difficulties of this new Settlement, to encounter Oppo&s;itions, and triumph over Di&s;couragements. They learnt Obedience by the things which they had &s;uffer'd; were purify'd in the Furnace of Affliction, and came forth as Gold out of the Fire refin'd. They were not like him in the Parable of the <HI>Sower,</HI> that receiv'd Seed into

No, but they were like him, that received Seed into <HI>good</HI> Ground, which brought forth Fruit <HI>to Perfection.</HI> They were &s;omething in the Apo&s;tle's Ca&s;e, who had long been &s;erving the Lord, with many Tears, and Temptations, which befel him by the laying in wait of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the Trial of their Faith (like hi&s;) wrought Patience: &s;o that altho' Afflic|tions awaited them continually, yet none of the&s;e things moved them, neither counted they their Life dear unto them, if &s;o be they might fini&s;h their Cour&s;e with Joy, and the Work which GOD had committed to them. They &s;tagger'd not at the Pro|mi&s;e thro' Unbelief, but in &s;ome &s;ort like <HI>Abraham,</HI> the Father of the Faithful, were &s;trong in Faith, giving Glory to GOD. Tho' in &s;ome days of Temp|tation, they might &s;eem almo&s;t <HI>&s;haken in Mind,</HI> and ready to give up their Undertaking as de&s;perate: yet they were enabled to overcome at the la&s;t, and their <HI>Faith failed not.</HI> They confe&s;&s;ed they were Pilgrims and Strangers upon Earth; had a Spirit in &s;ome &s;ingular mea&s;ure wean'd from this vain World by the Afflictions and Trials they had met with; and looked for a City to come, that hath Founda|tions, who&s;e Maker and Builder is GOD. Hence laying a&s;ide every Weight, they cou'd run with Patience the Race &s;et before them.</P>
<P>HAVING <HI>receiv'd the Word in much Affliction</HI> all their days from their Youth up, it was the le&s;s a Di&s;couragement to them now, that they mu&s;t <HI>thro' much Tribulation</HI> (tho' of another nature) <HI>enter in|to the Kingdom of God.</HI> Nay, the pro&s;pect of Dif|ficulties might &s;everal ways be of Service to the Work in hand; particularly by keeping them humble, by

The &s;ucceed|ing Generation indeed forgot the Works of the Lord, the great things he did for their Fathers in bringing them out of Egypt, and planting them in a good Land; and &s;o had very little Value for the Religion of their Fathers, but corrupted their ways, and for|&s;ook the Lord.

<P>THEY made it their Care to avoid every thing, that might open the Mouths of envious Enemies, to &s;peak Evil of the way of Truth on their account, and it was their Concern that their Light might &s;o &s;hine before others, as that they might glorify GOD in them, and acknowledge the Work they were en|gag'd in was <HI>of the Lord.</HI> In a word, the Threat|nings of <HI>Zion's</HI> Adver&s;aries, did but quicken them in their Work, &s;o that they took the greater Pains and made the more Ha&s;te in building the Walls of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>

<P>A faithful Magi&s;tracy and Mini&s;try are two di&s;|tingui&s;hing Articles of the publick Happine&s;s, and contribute as much as any at all to the Pro&s;perity of Virtue and Religion in a place.

<P>THEIR <HI>civil</HI> Leaders were in general Men of the be&s;t Character, for governing Abilities and Virtues. The <HI>Righteous</HI> were in Authority: which made the People rejoyce, and gave Reputation to Religion. There was much of the Kingdom of Chri&s;t in the civil Con&s;titution and Laws of the Country, and in the Spirit and Conduct of our primitive Rulers. They were, like <HI>David,</HI> Men according to GOD's own heart; feeding <HI>Jacob</HI> his People with Integrity and Skill. They were as the Heads of <HI>I&s;&s;achar,</HI> un|der&s;tanding of the Times to know what <HI>I&s;rael</HI> ought to do. They had the Temper of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who cho&s;e rather to &s;uffer Affliction with the People of GOD, than to enjoy the Plea&s;ures of Sin, which are but for a Sea&s;on, and e&s;teem'd the Reproach of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> greater Riches than the Trea&s;ures of <HI>Egypt.</HI> They con&s;ider'd them&s;elves as Rulers under and for CHRIST; as Mini&s;ters of GOD, appointed for a Ter|ror to evil Doers, and for a Prai&s;e to them that do well. Accordingly they were warm and active E|nemies to Vice, Bla&s;phemy, and Profanene&s;s: but diligent Promoters of univer&s;al Morality, and zea|lous Patrons of pure Religion. They were bright Examples of all Godline&s;s &amp; Hone&s;ty; Patterns of Ju&s;tice, Benignity, Gravity, Temperance and Self-denial: and apply'd their Authority for the promoting Piety &amp; Virtue in others.

Like godly <HI>Hezekiah</HI> they &s;pake comfortable words to &s;uch as taught the good Knowledge of the Lord, animating and encoura|ging them in the Service of God. And as <HI>Joa&s;h</HI> did not di&s;dain to take Coun&s;el of <HI>Jehojada</HI> the Prie&s;t, nor <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> of <HI>Hulda</HI> the Prophete&s;s; So nei|ther did the ancient Leaders in our civil Govern|ment di&s;dain to con&s;ult with the eccle&s;ia&s;tical Lea|ders in matters of Weight and general Concern|ment to the Churches and Common-wealth: but you might often &s;ee <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> meet and ki&s;s one another in the Mount of God. They were tender of the Credit and Honour of the &s;acred Mi|ni&s;try; taught the People by their own Example to reverence faithful Me&s;&s;engers of the Lord, and were ready to &s;creen &s;uch from the Injuries of the Malevolent. They were Members of the Churches them&s;elves, and by &s;etting a beautiful Pattern of Order, Peaceablene&s;s, and Submi&s;&s;ion to the Elders, to their Power and Rule in the Lord, they much contributed to a regular and quiet State of things therein. They were ardent Lovers of the Word and Ordinances of Chri&s;t, and A&s;&s;embly of the Saints; and gave their con&s;tant Attendence both in Sea&s;on and out of Sea&s;on. Like <HI>Nehemiah</HI> they con|tended for the Honour of the holy Sabbath, and did many good Deeds for the Hou&s;e of their GOD and the Offices thereof. They were as Eyes to his People in the Wilderne&s;s. They were as nur&s;ing

The Ble&s;&s;ing of him that was ready to peri&s;h came upon them: and they cau&s;ed the Widows heart to &s;ing. They put on Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and it clothed them: their Judgment was as a Robe and a Dia|dem. In a word, They &s;ought the Welfair of their People: were very tender of the young Plant com|mitted to their Care, nurs'd and cheri&s;h'd it with their benign Influences.</P>
<P>AND then the <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Leaders, they were al&s;o in general Men of the like approv'd Character; eminent in all mini&s;terial Gifts and Graces, which form'd them vi&s;ibly for great &amp; extraordinary Ser|vices. There were reforming Rulers: <HI>And there were with them the Prophets of God helping them.</HI> The Mini&s;ters of that day very much breathed the Spirit of the old Prophets and of the Apo&s;tles; in all things &s;tudying to approve them&s;elves as the Mini&s;ters of GOD, in much Patience, in Afflictions, in Nece&s;&s;ities, in Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, in Labours, in Watch|ings, in Fa&s;tings, by Purene&s;s, by Knowledge, by Long&s;uffering, by Kindne&s;s, by Love unfeigned, by the Word of Truth, by the Power of GOD, by the Armour of Righteou&s;ne&s;s on the right hand, and on the left; in Honour and Di&s;honour; as De|ceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet well|known; as &s;orrowful, yet alway rejoycing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all things. They were con&s;picuous Ex|amples of Mortification to the World, and of fer|vent Devotion; Men of GOD; Watchmen upon the Wall; giving them&s;elves continually to the Mini&s;try of the Word and Prayer: preparing their Hearts to &s;eek the Law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> Statutes and Judgments. They were burning &amp; &s;hining Light, &s;ome of the pure&s;t and brighte&s;t; and diffus'd an uncommon Lu&s;tre,

Their Hearts and Lips were toucht by a lively Coal from the Altar: and their Faces &s;hone, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> ju&s;t come down from the Mount, where he had been admitted to glorious Intimacies with Heaven.

This acquires a mighty Intere&s;t in the Hearts of all that know and &s;ee them: and in Con&s;equence thereof gives them a powerful Influence. It was one happy Circum|&s;tance of our fir&s;t Days, that the Churches of Chri&s;t here were illuminated with a godly and learned Mini&s;try: and their Eminency in &s;acred Knowledge, and in Grace and Goodne&s;s, did &s;ub&s;erve very much to the ble&s;&s;ed Ends of the Pa&s;toral Care, and abundantly conduce to the Pro&s;perity of the King|dom of Chri&s;t in this Place.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the Confirmation of the&s;e Characters and my other Re|marks, I refer the Reader to the HISTORIES of <HI>New-England,</HI> and in particular to that of the late Rev.

<P>SUCH Reflections may be <HI>directive</HI> to us by a View of the <HI>Example</HI> of our godly Progenitors, who have left us an admirable Pattern of Orthodoxy in Prin|ciples, Purity of Wor&s;hip, Strictne&s;s of Di&s;cipline and Government in the Family, School, Church,
<PB N="39" REF="003280_0045_0FF03CDDFAF3EF28">
and Common-wealth, virtuous Manners, mode&s;t Apparel, grave and u&s;eful Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>AND then &s;uch Reflections will tend to <HI>excite</HI> in us a Care of <HI>imitating</HI> them; by a Sen&s;e of the pe|culiar Obligations lying on us, as we are the near De&s;cendents of &s;uch holy Ance&s;tors, who&s;e Names will be a Reproach to us, if we do not al&s;o inherit their Virtues; by a Sen&s;e of the Bonds of the Co|venant upon us, and of the Bonds of Gratitude we are under, both with relation to GOD and our Fa|thers; by a Sen&s;e of the many Prayers they have put up for us, and of the &s;olemn Charges they have left us, enforced by a very attractive Example, the Example of &s;uch as we've the highe&s;t Rea&s;on to love and venerate the Memory of, all which will but &s;erve to aggravate the Guilt of our Apo&s;ta|&s;ies, and will ri&s;e up in Judgment again&s;t us, if we for&s;ake the GOD of our Fathers:&mdash;In fine, by a Sen&s;e of the Awefulne&s;s of our &s;tanding in GOD's Vineyard, by the Con&s;ideration that the Axe is laid to the root of the Trees, that every Plant which is not of GOD's planting, &s;hall be rooted up, and every Tree which bringeth not forth good Fruit &s;hall be cut down.</P>
<P>THUS we &s;ee, tho&s;e Reflections are many ways of u&s;eful Tendency to the Ends of Holine&s;s and the Chri&s;tian Life; which &s;hould &s;trongly recommend them to our frequent and affectionate Entertain|ment.</P>
<P>U&s;e II. LET <HI>us al&s;o reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on our</HI> pre&s;ent State, <HI>and lay to heart the Apo&s;ta&s;ies of this degenerate Day.</HI></P>
<P>ALASS! Are we not become as an Oak, who&s;e Leaf fadeth, and the Stock thereof is ready to die in the Ground! May not <HI>I&s;rael</HI> be call'd an empty Vine; bringing forth fruit unto him&s;elf! How is the faithful City become an Harlot! The Silver
<PB N="40" REF="003280_0046_0FF03CE1B2DBF560">
become Dro&s;s, and the mo&s;t fine Gold changed! This is for a Lamentation, and &s;hall be for a Lamen|tation.</P>
<P>MAY it not be complain'd, that Strangers having devour'd our Strength, grey Hairs are upon us! We are now become a very mixt Generation: and may I not add in Con&s;equence thereof, a very a|po&s;tate one? May there not ju&s;tly be exhibited again&s;t us a Complaint in the Language of <HI>Judg.</HI> 2. 10. <HI>And al&s;o all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there aro&s;e another generation after them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which he had done for I&s;rael.</HI> Has not that Word been fulfilled in our Day? Act. 20. 30. <HI>Al&s;o of your own &s;elves &s;hall men ari&s;e, &s;peaking perver&s;e things, to draw away di&s;ciples after them.</HI></P>
<P>HOW many in this Land have early corrupted their Ways, and for&s;aken the Lord GOD of their Fathers! Have not &s;ome renounced the Princi|ples of Truth, and others the Rules of Practice, in the Wor&s;hip of GOD, in the Di&s;cipline of his Hou&s;e &amp;c. which a humble &s;earch into the holy Scriptures brought their pious Ance&s;tors to an Ac|quaintance with and Profe&s;&s;ion of! Have not many renounced the Covenant of their Fathers, and be|come Enemies to the Work of GOD in this Planta|tion, as a Plantation for the Purpo&s;es of Religion!</P>
<P>AND among tho&s;e who profe&s;s in general an Ad|herence to the Cau&s;e of GOD, which brought our Forefathers over to <HI>New-England,</HI> how many are there who practically pour Contempt upon it, by a Coldne&s;s in the Defence of it, and by Lives di&s;agreable to it!</P>
<P>SURE I am, we have Rea&s;on to take Shame to our &s;elves; all of us, Magi&s;trates, Mini&s;ters, and People. We have many Defects, Neglects, and Mi&s;carriages to bewail, by which our Profe&s;&s;ion has been &s;tained, the Go&s;pel hinder'd, and the Flou|ri&s;hing
<PB N="41" REF="003280_0047_0FEFDB42AC4BE3B8">
of Religion ob&s;tructed. Ala&s;s! If we com|pare our&s;elves with our Forefathers (and this let us often do, to humble and quicken our&s;elve&s;) how va&s;tly &s;hort do we come of their bright Exam|ple! It &s;adly appears, <Q>They had better Heads, better Hearts, and better Management than we. We want their Capacity, their Character, and their Conduct very much: and therefore no Wonder, if we likewi&s;e want their Succe&s;s. Ala&s;s! we want their eminent Gifts and Graces. We want their ardent Love to GOD, his Truths and Ways. We want their peaceable healing Spirit. We want their di&s;intere&s;ted Humility and Self-denial. We want their generous Con|tempt of this <HI>pre&s;ent World:</HI> We want their &s;trong Faith and affecting Views of <HI>another.</HI> And how many Defects are there in the manner of our Conduct! In the Seriou&s;ne&s;s of our Deportment; the Prudence, the Faithfulne&s;s, the Diligence, the Application and Zeal of our Management, in Affairs &s;piritual and moral.</Q></P>
<P>IN a word, we want very much the Spirit of Prayer, religious Conference, brotherly Watch, and Communion of Saints; the Family-Government, the Church-Di&s;cipline, the exemplary Sanctification of the Lord's Day, the Value for Go&s;pel-Liberties, and Affection to the Hou&s;e and Ordinances of GOD, the Zeal for Reformation,&mdash;which &s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd our pious Ance&s;tors. We pretend to excel them in a <HI>catholick Spirit,</HI> as 'tis call'd, and to enter|tain more generous Principles than they: but ala&s;s have we not very much lo&s;t our Zeal for the great Sub&s;tantials of Religion, as well as for peculiar Mo|dalities! And is it not to be fear'd, that many un|der the glorious Ma&s;k of Chri&s;tian Charity hide a cold Indifference to all Religion! O let us &s;ee and reali&s;e the Degeneracies of the pre&s;ent Day: that there may be no Occa&s;ion for a Rebuke of our Stu|pidity,
<PB N="42" REF="003280_0048_0FF03CE7364090A8">
That <HI>gray Hairs are &s;prinkled upon us, and we know it not.</HI> Let us be humbly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of our ma|nifold Deficiencies, and lament <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> our Faults and Follies; our Abu&s;es of Pro&s;perity and Liberty, our Pride and Sen&s;uality, our Impieties again&s;t GOD and Immoralities again&s;t Men, our Hypocri&s;ies, and Envies, and evil &s;peakings, and fal&s;e Dealings:&mdash;Which our Sins do receive the highe&s;t Aggravati|ons po&s;&s;ible, from that peculiar Profe&s;&s;ion we have made of Religion, from that rich Abundance of &s;a|cred Opportunities and &s;piritual Provi&s;ions for our Souls, and that glorious Shine of Go&s;pel-Light, we have &s;o long enjoy'd.</P>
<P>O that we may have Wi&s;dom to con&s;ider the&s;e Things, and to repent in time, that &s;o Iniquity may not be our Ruine! That's the Voice of Heaven to us, Jer. 6. 8. <HI>Be thou in&s;tructed, O Jeru&s;alem, le&s;t my Soul depart from thee.</HI> The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;peaks to us, as he did to the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> Rev. 2. 4, 5. <HI>Neverthele&s;s, I have &s;omewhat again&s;t thee, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t left thy fir&s;t love. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the fir&s;t works; or el&s;e I will come unto thee quick|ly, and will remove thy candle&s;tick out of his place, ex|cept thou repent.</HI> Let us &s;olemnly con&s;ider this Re|proof. O that it may come with a powerful Im|pre&s;&s;ion upon our Hearts, and produce agreable Ef|fects in our Lives! That <HI>New-England,</HI> which is in danger this day to be lo&s;t in <HI>New-England</HI> (as one expre&s;&s;es it) may not be bury'd in its own Ruines, and that <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> may not (in &s;piritual regards, as once in temporal) have the reproachful Name of <HI>Lo&s;t Town</HI> be&s;tow'd upon it.</P>
<P>BUT now to conclude,</P>
<P>U&s;e III. LET <HI>us all have a holy Concern upon our Minds, as we would have the Lord Jehovah to be</HI> NEW-ENGLAND's <HI>Saviour, that we may an&s;wer his ju&s;t

Expectations from us, and be yet a Tree of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, bearing Fruit to his Glory.</HI></P>
<P>WE have Rea&s;on to admire the Divine Patience towards a &s;inning People, That we have not long &s;ince been cut down as Cumberers of the Ground, but enjoy as yet a Standing in GOD's Vineyard. It is of the Mercy of the Lord, we are not con&s;um'd. O that the &s;paring Goodne&s;s of GOD may lead us to Repentance! Let us adore the Grace and Power of Chri&s;t in continuing us a People yet before him; that the Root is not dried up from beneath, nor the Branches cut off from above; but there's yet Life in the Root, and &s;till <HI>from Him is our Fruit found.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is worthy a particular Notice, the <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> which our gracious Head and Lord has put upon <HI>the&s;e Churches,</HI> in con|tinuing them for &s;o long a Tract of Time on their original Foundations; keeping them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame Scriptu|ral Principles, Modes of Wor&s;hip, Government &amp; Order (with &s;o much of <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI>) which our Forefathers profe&s;s'd and practis'd, and maintaining vital Godline&s;s among Profe&s;&s;ors &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly in a Number of In&s;tances, from Generation to Generation. This is one of the <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing</HI> Glories of <HI>New-England.</HI> For very few Places in the World, where the Go&s;|pel at any time has been planted, have continu'd the &s;pace of one HUNDRED Years, without either a &s;ad <HI>Di&s;&s;ipation,</HI> or a wretched <HI>Depravation</HI> of their Church-State; Such as through the Patience and Grace of GOD our Saviour, the&s;e Churches remain yet happily pre&s;erv'd from.</NOTE></P>
<P>WE are weak indeed this day, by the plucking &s;o many Corner-Stones out of our Walls, and by the frowning A&s;pects of Providence in other Re|gards. But &s;till let us not give way to unbelieving Thoughts and Di&s;couragements, as if the Lord meant to utterly ca&s;t us off. I tru&s;t the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has yet a precious Intere&s;t among us, which he will not abandon. We &s;ee &s;ome Tokens that the Spirit of Chri&s;t remaineth among us. There's &s;till a Remnant of praying Saints and righteous Ones; &s;uch as are of the &s;ame excellent Principles
<PB N="44" REF="003280_0050_0FF03CEBDB5C68E8">
and of the &s;ame excellent Tempers, that our holy Fathers were under the Dominion of; Men, who &s;tand in the Gap, Repairers of Breaches, and Re|&s;torers of Paths to dwell in. And then the threat|ning Clouds, which gather over us &s;o thick and fa&s;t in the&s;e &s;haking Times, they may be meant unto Good; to humble and reform and do us Good in the I&s;&s;ue. Wherefore lift up the Hands that hang down, and &s;trengthen the feeble Knees.</P>
<P>LET us encourage our &s;elves in the Lord, who by his Power created the World out of Nothing, who brought up <HI>I&s;rael</HI> out of Egyptian Bondage, and who form'd and rais'd this his People from low Beginnings. With him is the Re&s;idue of the Spirit. He <HI>hath</HI> been mindful of us, and he <HI>will</HI> ble&s;s us: He will ble&s;s the Hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> He will ble&s;s the Hou&s;e of <HI>Aaron.</HI> Is it not an applicable Encour|agement to <HI>New-England,</HI> that in I&s;a. 66. 5. <HI>Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hated you, that ca&s;t you out for my name's &s;ake, &s;aid, Let the Lord be glorified: but he &s;hall appear to your joy, and they &s;hall be a&s;hamed.</HI></P>
<P>LET us be &s;ollicitous to do all we can to &s;ecure the Continuance of the gracious Pre&s;ence of GOD among us. To this end, let us be concern'd to get every provoking Evil reform'd: let us be inqui&s;i|tive into the Cau&s;es of the pre&s;ent decay of Piety, and Un&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s of the Go&s;pel; labour to repair all our Defects, rectify all our Mi&s;managements, and re|trieve our Characters. Let us unite all our Endea|vours, Cares, and Prayers, for the Recovery of lan|gui&s;hing Religion, for the building up Chri&s;t's King|dom, and carrying on the Work of the Lord, that we may &s;ee the Return of good Days. That's the Call of Chri&s;t to his People here, Rev. 3. 2, 3. <HI>Be watchful, and &s;trengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works per|fect before God. Remember therefore how thou ha&s;t re|ceived
<PB N="45" REF="003280_0051_0FF03CED5FD1A528">
and heard, and hold fa&s;t, and repent.</HI> And as in ver. II. <HI>Behold I come quickly: hold that fa&s;t which thou ha&s;t, that no man take thy crown.</HI> He that hath an Ear, let him hear what the Spirit &s;aith unto the Churches.</P>
<P>LET us often recollect the Errand of our Fore|fathers into this Land, and pur&s;ue that great Inte|re&s;t, which brought them hither, when it was a Land not &s;own, an inho&s;pitable Wilderne&s;s, where (as they were wont to &s;ay) they e&s;teem'd&mdash;<HI>brown Bread and the Go&s;pel good Fair.</HI> Let us be mindful of the holy Covenant, wherein they have bound us to be the Lord's, and teach it our Children, who &s;hall tell it to the Generation to come, that they al&s;o may &s;et their Hope in the Lord, and that our little Ones may know the Covenant-Care and Faithful|fulne&s;s of the GOD of I&s;rael, under who&s;e Wings their Forefathers came hither to dwell in Safety. Let us attend to the Words of <HI>David'</HI>s dying Charge to the Rulers and People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> 1 Chron. 28. 8. <HI>Now therefore in the &s;ight of all I&s;rael the congregation of the Lord, and in the audience of our God, keep and &s;eek for all the commandments of the Lord your God: that ye may po&s;&s;e&s;s this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.</HI></P>
<P>LET us imitate our godly Ance&s;tors in the wi&s;e Methods and indefatigable Pains they took for the Security &amp; Advancement of the Kingdom of Chri&s;t in <HI>New-England.</HI> Let us cheri&s;h the &s;ame excellent Spirit and Principles, which were &s;o much their Di&s;|tinction &amp; Glory. Let us be earne&s;t at the Throne of Grace for a more plentiful Effu&s;ion of the Holy Spirit, in order to a happy Revival of the Work of GOD; that we may hear many inquiring the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, and that true and effectual Conver&s;ions may be more frequently &s;een among us. We are prophe&s;ying as in the mid&s;t of a Valley full of Bones, dead Men's Bones, very
<PB N="46" REF="003280_0052_0FF03CEEEB872C58">
dry: But if God cau&s;e Breath to enter into them, they &s;hall live, and renew their Strength, and the dry Bones &s;hall flouri&s;h like an Herb. O that we might &s;ee it, and our Heart &s;hall rejoyce! May this ancient Church be like a Tree that &s;preadeth out her Roots by the River who&s;e leaf withereth not, neither cea&s;eth &s;he from yielding Fruit. May this Town be as a water'd Garden, that &s;eeth not when Heat cometh, abounding with Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s: and let our Beloved come in|to his Garden, and eat of his plea&s;ant Fruits! May Salvation be nigh to us, and Glory dwell in our Land! Return, O Lord, for thy &s;ervants &s;ake, the tribes of thine inheritance: The people of thy holine&s;s have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it but a little while. The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our Fathers; and let the&s;e my words, wherewith I have made Supplication before the Lord, be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night, that he may maintain the Cau&s;e of his People at all times as the matter &s;hall require; that all the People of the Earth may know that the Lord he is God, the God of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and our God, our Fathers God, and the God of our Children. And let us all now agree in making that Re&s;olution, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 62. I. <HI>For Zion's &s;ake will I not hold my peace, and for</HI> Jeru&s;alem's <HI>&s;ake I will not re&s;t, until the righteou&s;ne&s;s thereof go forth as brightne&s;s, and the Salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.</HI></P>
