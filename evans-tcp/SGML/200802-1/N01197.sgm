But alas, the Wine would not be grateful to their Palate; It would be wine of A&s;toni&s;hment and Confu&s;ion; all Ranks, Orders and Degrees among them, from him that S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t on the Throne, to the meane&s;t Inhabi|tant in the Kingdom, mu&s;t drink of it, and feel the fatal and ruining, and intoxicating con&s;equences of it.

<P>In the Words; which I &s;hall not &s;tand upon a Critical Analy&s;is of, Two things may be briefly Ob&s;erved.</P>

<PB N="5" REF="001429_0007_0FB2F48C7A95E108">
all the fearful Aggravations attending them, their Re|penting of and Turning from all their Iniquities. A bare Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin, without hearty Sorrow, Repentance, and utmo&s;t indeavour to Return and For&s;ake it, will &s;tand the Sinner in little &s;tead, and will not turn to his advantage: Prov. 28. 13. <HI>He that Covereth his Sins &s;hall not pro&s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, but who&s;e confe&s;&s;eth, and for&s;aketh them, &s;hall have Mercy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> The Illu&s;tration of the Exhortation. Divers things claim to be con&s;idered here; As&punc;</P>
<P>I. The Per&s;on Exhorting; The Prophet <HI>Jeremiah.</HI> God's Prophets and Mini&s;ters mu&s;t denounce the Judgments of Heaven, again&s;t Heav'n daring &amp; offending Sinners. They mu&s;t cry aloud, and not &s;pare, lift up their Voices like Trumpets, and &s;hew the Lords People their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and the Hou&s;e of Jacob their Sins, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 58. 1. A neglect herein, would argue them of Unfaithfulne&s;s to God, and of fal&s;ene&s;s to their own Souls; and would bring upon them the guilt of the Blood of the Souls of others, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33. 7, 8. But yet it becomes them to manage this Service, in the mo&s;t Affectionate and Winning way &amp; manner imaginable. They &s;hould indeavour to make Sinners &s;en&s;ible, that altho' they mu&s;t out of Faithfulne&s;s to God, and their precious Souls, denounce the Judgments of God again&s;t them, yet they are far from de&s;iring the woful day. It would be the greate&s;t Joy, Plea&s;ure, and Satisfaction to them in the World, might they be made In&s;trumental to promote their Repentance and Reformation, whereby the anger of God might be appea&s;ed, and the final Execution of threatened Judgments diverted.</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> The Per&s;ons concerned in the Exhortation. All Ranks, Orders and Degrees of Men among them. Their Kings, Prie&s;ts, Prophets, and all the Inhabitants of Jeru&s;a|lem, <HI>v.</HI> 13. All had been guilty of Provoking God to di&s;|plea&s;ure, and therefore it was requi&s;ite they &s;hould <HI>All</HI> joy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in that nece&s;&s;ary duty of Confe&s;&s;ing&punc; Bewailing, Repenting, and Reforming of their Sins, whereby Gods anger might be Averted, and their final doom Prevented.</P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> The Arguments by which the Exhortation is pre&s;&s;ed upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001429_0008_0FB2F48F4505A8E8">
<HI>I.</HI> God was &s;till their God. They might look upon, acknowledge, and plead with God, as a God yet theirs by Covenant. <HI>Give Glory to the Lord your God.</HI> O a&s;toni&s;hing and amazing Con&s;ideration! O the inconcievable Depths of Covenant Mercy! will God own a Covenant Relation to &s;uch a fearful degenerate People? A People who&s;e deeds had over-pa&s;&s;ed the deeds of the wicked, <HI>Jer</HI> 5. 28. A People who had for&s;aken the fountain of Living Waters, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2. 13. A Sotti&s;h and Fooli&s;h People, who were only wi&s;e to do Evil, but to do good had no under&s;tanding, <HI>Jer.</HI> 4. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">2. A People that were become Bra&s;s and Iron, grievous Revolters and Back&s;liders, <HI>Jer.</HI> 6. 28. A People &s;lidden back by a perpetual back&s;liding, that held fa&s;t de|ceit, and refu&s;ed to return, <HI>Jer.</HI> 8, 5. O the &s;urprizing Charms of &s;uch an heart affecting and melting Con&s;idera|tion! And this, doubtle&s;s our Prophet had in his Eye. His mentioning of this Con&s;ideration, was with de&s;ign to in&s;inuate the Obligation deriving from it. God is as yet your God, and would you have him to continue &s;uch; You mu&s;t then Repent of your Sins, Reform your Evil Ways, humble your &s;elves under his high and mighty Hand&punc; Live &amp; Walk in all manner of Obedience to his Holy and Righteous commands; In which way alone you may Expect to have the ble&s;&s;ings of the Everla&s;ting Covenant continued and &s;ecured to you, and the pre&s;ent Storm of impending wrath diverted from you.</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> Though the Sentence was pronounced, yet the Execu|tion was re&s;pited. <HI>Before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e cau&s;e darkne&s;s and before your feet stumble on the dark Mountains. q. d.</HI> Dark di&s;pen&s;ations you are threatened with. A dark and black day is ha&s;ten|ing on you; it is coming, it is coming apace, but through the wonderful and a&s;toni&s;hing Patience of God it is not yet come; Nothing can prevent its coming but your Repen|tance, and Reformation. Set about this work therefore with all imaginable &s;peed, for although it be not yet too late, you know not how &s;oon it may. This argument is the &s;ame with that the Prophet <HI>Zephaniah</HI> u&s;ed with his People: Zeph, 2. 1, 2. <HI>Gather your &s;elves together, gather your
<PB N="7" REF="001429_0009_0FB2F49024181CC0">
&s;elves together, O Nation not de&s;ired. Before the decree bring forth, before the day pa&s;s as the Chaff, before the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lords Anger come upon you.</HI> And this day he tells them, as our Prophet here, would be a day of Darkne&s;s and Gloomine&s;s, a day of Clouds and thick darkne&s;s, <HI>Zeph.</HI> 1. 15.</P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> It would be a Vain thing for them to hope, this duty neglected, that they &s;hould ever emerge out of their pre|&s;ent Evil Circum&s;tances, or e&s;cape the pre&s;ent threatned Storm of Wrath coming upon them. Their fal&s;e Pro|phets, indeed, flattered them to pre&s;ume and lot upon this, and they were but too ready to hug and embrace the de|ception. But he leaves them to con&s;ider what a terrible aggravation of their approaching de&s;truction it would be, to find, as a&s;&s;uredly they would, were not his advice com|plied with; all &s;uch their delu&s;ive and ill grounded pre|&s;umptions, and expectations, i&s;&s;ue in fearful fru&s;trations&punc; and a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;appointments. This is the purport of that expre&s;&s;ion in our Text; <HI>And while ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ook for Light, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e turn it into the Shadow of death, and make it gro&s;s darkne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Our way is now cleared to a very weighty and awaken|ing,</P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE</LABEL>
<HI>It is the high concernment of all Orders of Men, among a Profe&s;&s;ing People, with whom God hath been long, to little purpo&s;e, pleading a Controver&s;y, &amp; who on that account have rea|&s;on to expect more terrible out-breakings of divine Wrath upon them; to endeavour, in their &s;everal Capacities, A Speedy &amp; thorough</HI> REFORMATION <HI>of all GOD</HI>-Provoking Evils <HI>in the mid&s;t of them.</HI></P>

The Prophet a&s;&s;ures them their abiding unreformed under the reiterated Strokes of divine di&s;plea&s;ure, by which God had been E&s;&s;aying their Amend|ment and Recovery, out of their Sinful State and Conditi|on, was di&s;plea&s;ing to God, and would be of the la&s;t di&s;ad|vantage to them&s;elves: for this God would make Jeru&s;a|lem heaps, A den of dragons, their Cities &s;hould become de&s;olate, and without Inhabitant; for this God would feed them with Wormwood, and give them the water of Gall to drink, <HI>Jer.</HI> 9 11, 15.

For if the Reformation of every thing that is provoking to God among&s;t &s;uch a People be not &s;peedily pur&s;ued, whence can the neglect be &s;uppo&s;ed to flow, but from a perver&s;e re&s;olvedne&s;s to per&s;i&s;t in their Sinful Cour&s;es, and a wretched in&s;en&s;i|bility of, and &s;tupid unconcernedne&s;s about the mi&s;eries con&s;equential hereupon?

<P><HI>I mu&s;t but briefly touch on the things that claim a Con&s;ideration by us.</HI></P>
<P>Should you not then, O ye Covenant People of the Lord, with deepe&s;t Penitential Mourning and Humiliation, fall down before a ju&s;tly irritated and offended God, and with ut-mo&s;t brokenne&s;s of heart own, &amp; acknowledge all your mighty Sins and multiplied tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and all their highly aggravated Circum&s;tances, as being Commit|ted again&s;t &s;o much Light, Love, Merciful di&s;pen&s;ations, Repeated Convictions, Warnings, Cautions, Confe&s;&s;ions, Vows and Promi&s;es of Amendment? Should you not humbly accept the Puni&s;hment of your Sins, and Confe&s;s that God is Righteous in all his di&s;pen&s;ations of humbling Providences, by which he hath te&s;tified his anger and di&s;|plea&s;ure again&s;t you? And that in the mid&s;t of his Judg|ments, He hath remembred Mercy, Puni&s;hing you le&s;s than you have de&s;erved? Is it not duty to repent of, hate, abhor, turn from, for&s;ake, and loath your &s;elves for all the high handed Provocations, whereby you have in|cen&s;ed the Divine Maje&s;ty again&s;t you, and &s;o far cau&s;ed Him to become, and act toward you as an Enemy? Is not the Pardoning Grace and Mercy of God thro' the Al|mighty Redeemer, to be humbly and earne&s;tly implored, and &s;incerely relied on? Should you not Endeavour a full purpo&s;e of heart, to renounce all the ways of Sin and Folly, and walk uprightly with God in all the duties of the Covenant? And can any of the&s;e duties be performed by you, unle&s;s the Lord by the irre&s;i&s;tible Grace of his Spirit turn, change and make a victorious Conque&s;t upon your hearts, taking away the heart of Stone, and giving you an heart of Fle&s;h? Is it not then your high con|cernment, by earne&s;t Prayers and Supplications, to implore this Mercy from the Hands of a God hearing Prayer, that
