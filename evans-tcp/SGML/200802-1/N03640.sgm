<P>WHOEVER reads the Go&s;pel with a &s;ingle Eye, and &s;incere Intention, will find, that our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord took all Opportunities of reminding his Di&s;ciples that his Kingdom was not of this World; that <HI>his</HI> Doctrine was a Doctrine of the Cro&s;s; and that their profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be his Followers, would call them to a con&s;tant State of voluntary or Self-&s;uffering and Self-denial.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004449_0004_100D822944DE5E50">THE Words of the Text afford us one In&s;tance, among many, of our Saviour's Behaviour in this Mat|ter; For having in the preceding Ver&s;es revealed him&s;elf to <HI>Peter,</HI> and the other Apo&s;tles, to be <HI>The</HI> CHRIST <HI>of</HI> GOD; le&s;t they &s;hould be too much elated with &s;uch a peculiar Di&s;covery of his Deity, or think that their Relation to &s;o great a Per&s;onage would be attended with nothing but Pomp and Gran|deur; He tells them, in the 22d Ver&s;e, That the Son of Man was to &s;uffer many Things in this World, though He was to be crowned with eternal Glory and Honour in the next: And that if any of them, or their Po&s;terity, would &s;hare in the &s;ame Honour, they mu&s;t bear a Part with him in his Self-denial and Sufferings. For <HI>He &s;aid unto them all, If any Man will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf.</HI></P>

<ITEM>II. <HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to prove the Uni|ver&s;ality and Rea&s;onablene&s;s of this Duty of Self-denial.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>Thirdly</HI> and la&s;tly, I &s;hall offer &s;ome Conside|rations, which may &s;erve as &s;o many Motives to reconcile us to, and quicken us in the Practice of this Doctrine of Self-denial.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="7" REF="004449_0005_100D9DC20A27EE08">I. AND <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> then, I am to &s;hew the Nature of the Self-denial recommended in the Text; or in how many Re&s;pects we mu&s;t deny our&s;elves, in Order to follow JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>NOW as the Faculties of the Soul are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Under&s;tanding, Will, and Affections; &s;o in all the&s;e mu&s;t each of us deny him&s;elf. We mu&s;t not <HI>lean to our own Under&s;tanding,</HI> being <HI>wi&s;e in our own Eyes, and prudent in our own Sight</HI>; but we mu&s;t &s;ubmit our &s;hort-&s;ighted Rea&s;on to the Light of Divine Revelation: For there are My&s;teries in Reli|gion, which are above, though not contrary to, our natural Rea&s;on: and therefore we &s;hall never become Chri&s;tians unle&s;s we ca&s;t down <HI>Imaginations, and every high Thing that exalteth it&s;elf again&s;t the Knowledge of GOD, and bring into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of CHRIST.</HI> It is in this Re&s;pect, as well as others, that we mu&s;t <HI>become Fools for CHRIST's Sake,</HI> and acknowledge we know nothing without Revelation, as we ought to know. We mu&s;t then, with all Humility and Reverence, embrace the my&s;te|rious Truths revealed to us <HI>in the Holy Scriptures,</HI> for thus only can we become truly Wi&s;e, even <HI>Wi&s;e unto Salvation.</HI> It was Matter of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord's Thank&s;giving to his heavenly Father, that he had <HI>hid the&s;e Things from the Wi&s;e and Prudent, and had revealed them unto Babes.</HI> And in this Re&s;pect al&s;o we mu&s;t <HI>be converted and become as little Children,</HI> teachable, and willing to follow the Lamb into what|&s;oever My&s;teries he &s;hall be plea&s;ed to lead us; and believe and practi&s;e all divine Truths, not becau&s;e we
<PB N="8" REF="004449_0006_100D9DC8A8AF40B0">
can demon&s;trate them, but becau&s;e GOD, <HI>who cannot lie,</HI> has revealed them to us.</P>
<P>HENCE then we may trace Infidelity to its Foun|tain Head: For it is nothing el&s;e but a Pride of the Under&s;tanding, an Unwillingne&s;s to &s;ubmit to the <HI>Truth of GOD,</HI> that makes &s;o many, profe&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves Wi&s;e, to become &s;uch Fools as to deny <HI>the Lord who</HI> has &s;o dearly <HI>bought them</HI>; and di&s;pute the Divinity of that Eternal Word, <HI>in whom they live, and move, and have their Being:</HI> Whereby, 'tis ju&s;tly to be feared, they will bring upon them&s;elves &s;ure, if not &s;wift, De&s;truction.</P>
<P>BUT to return: As we mu&s;t deny our&s;elves in our Under&s;tandings, &s;o mu&s;t we deny, or, as it might be more properly rendered, renounce our Wills; that is, we mu&s;t make our own Wills no Principle of Action, but <HI>whether we eat or drink, or what|&s;oever we do, we mu&s;t do all,</HI> not merely to plea&s;e our&s;elves, <HI>but to the Glory of GOD.</HI> Not that we are therefore to imagine we are to have no Plea|&s;ure in any Thing we do, (Wi&s;dom's <HI>Ways are Ways of Plea&s;antne&s;s</HI>) but plea&s;ing our&s;elves mu&s;t not be the principal, but only the &s;ubordinate End of our Actions.</P>
<P>AND I cannot but particularly pre&s;s this Doctrine upon you, becau&s;e it is the grand Secret of our Holy Religion. It is this, my Brethren, that di&s;tin|gui&s;hes the True Chri&s;tian from the mere Morali&s;t and formal Profe&s;&s;or; and which alone can render any of our Actions acceptable in GOD's Sight;
<PB N="9" REF="004449_0007_100D9DC64645FCD0">
For <HI>if thine Eye be &s;ingle,</HI> &s;ays our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord, <HI>Matth.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> that is, If thou aime&s;t &s;imply to plea&s;e GOD <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> any Regard to thy own Will, <HI>thy whole <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> that is, all thy Actions, <HI>will be full of Light</HI>; agreeable to the Go&s;pel, which is called <HI>Light:</HI> But <HI>if thine Eye be evil,</HI> if thine Intention be diverted any other Way, <HI>thy whole Body,</HI> all thy Actions, <HI>will be full of Darkne&s;s,</HI> unprofitable, and capable of no Reward. For we mu&s;t not only do the Will of GOD, but do it <HI>becau&s;e</HI> it is his Will; &s;ince we pray that GOD's <HI>Will may be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</HI> And, no doubt, the ble&s;&s;ed An|gels not only do every Thing that GOD willeth, but do it chearfully, out of this Principle, becau&s;e GOD willeth it: And if we &s;hould live as we pray, we mu&s;t <HI>go and do likewi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>BUT farther; as we mu&s;t renounce our own Wills in <HI>doing,</HI> &s;o likewi&s;e mu&s;t we renounce them in <HI>&s;uf|fering</HI> the Will of GOD. What&s;oever befalls us, we mu&s;t &s;ay with good old <HI>Eli, It is the LORD, let him do what &s;eemeth him good</HI>; or with one that was infinitely greater than <HI>Eli, Father, not my Will, but thine be done.</HI> <Q>O JESU, thine was an innocent Will, yet Thou renounced&s;t it: Teach us, even us al&s;o, O our Saviour! to &s;ubmit our Wills to thine, in all <HI>the Evils</HI> which &s;hall be <HI>brought upon us</HI>; and <HI>in every Thing</HI> enable us to <HI>give Thanks,</HI> &s;ince it <HI>is</HI> thy ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Will concerning us!</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIRDLY, and la&s;tly, we mu&s;t deny our&s;elves, as in our Under&s;tandings and Wills, &s;o likewi&s;e in our Affections. More particularly, we mu&s;t deny
<PB N="10" REF="004449_0008_100D9DCBA4366A90">
our&s;elves the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Indulgence and Self-enjoy|ment of Riches: <HI>If any Man will come after me,</HI> &s;ays our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, <HI>he mu&s;t for&s;ake all and follow me.</HI> And again (to &s;hew the utter Incon&s;i&s;tency of the Love of the Things of this World with the Love of the Father) he tells us, that <HI>unle&s;s a Man for&s;ake all that he hath, he cannot be my Di&s;ciple.</HI></P>
<P>FAR be it from me to think that the&s;e Texts are to be taken in a literal Sen&s;e, as though they obliged rich Per&s;ons to go &s;ell all that they have, and give to the Poor, (for that would put it out of their Power to be &s;erviceable to the Poor for the future) but, however, they certainly imply thus much, that we are to &s;it loo&s;e to, &s;ell, and for&s;ake all in Affection, and be willing to part with every Thing, when GOD &s;hall require it at our Hands: That is, as the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, we mu&s;t <HI>u&s;e the World, as though we u&s;ed it not</HI>; and though we are <HI>in the World,</HI> we mu&s;t not be <HI>of</HI> it. We mu&s;t look upon our&s;elves as Stewards, and not Proprietors of the manifold Gifts of GOD; provide fir&s;t what is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for our&s;elves and our Hou&s;holds, and expend the re&s;t, not in Indulgences and &s;uperfluous Orna|ments, forbidden by the Apo&s;tle, but in clothing, feeding, and relieving the naked, hungry, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Di&s;ciples of JESUS CHRIST. This is what our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord would have us under&s;tand by for&s;ak|ing all, and in this Sen&s;e mu&s;t each of us deny him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible that this will &s;eem <HI>an hard Saying</HI> to many, who will be offended becau&s;e they are co|vetous,
<PB N="11" REF="004449_0009_100D9DCDA365B0F8">
and <HI>Lovers of Plea&s;ure more than Lovers of God:</HI> But <HI>if I yet plea&s;ed</HI> &s;uch <HI>Men, I &s;hould not be the Servant of Chri&s;t.</HI> No, we mu&s;t not, like <HI>Ahab</HI>'s fal&s;e Prophets, have a <HI>lying Spirit in our Mouths,</HI> nor fail to <HI>declare</HI> (with St. <HI>Paul</HI>) <HI>the whole Will of GOD</HI>; and, like hone&s;t <HI>Micaiah,</HI> out of Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion, tell Men the Truth, though they may fal&s;ely think <HI>we prophecy not Good, but Evil concern|ing</HI> them.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed: As we mu&s;t renounce our Affec|tion for Riches, &s;o likewi&s;e our Affections for our Relations, when they &s;tand in Oppo&s;ition to our Love of and Duty to, GOD: For thus &s;aith the Saviour of the World: <HI>If any Man will come after me, and hateth not his father and Mother, his Chil|dren and Brethren and Si&s;ters, yea, and his own Life al&s;o, he cannot be my Di&s;ciple.</HI>&mdash;Strange Doctrine this! What, hate our own Fle&s;h? What, hate the Father that begat us, the Mother that bare us! <HI>How can the&s;e Things be?</HI> Can GOD contradict him&s;elf? Has he not bid us Honour our Father and Mo|ther? And yet we are here commanded to hate them. How mu&s;t the&s;e Truths be reconciled? Why, by interpreting the Word <HI>hate,</HI> not in a rigorous and ab&s;olute Sen&s;e, but <HI>comparatively:</HI> not as imply|ing a total Alienation, but a le&s;s Degree of Affecti|on. For thus our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour him&s;elf, (the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t Expo&s;itor of his own Meaning) explains <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> a parallel Text, <HI>Matth.</HI> x.37. <HI>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me&punc; He that loveth Son or Daughter more than me, is not worthy of me.</HI> So that when the Per&s;ua&s;ions
<PB N="12" REF="004449_0010_100D9DD0BB471450">
of &s;uch our Friends (as for our Trial they may be permitted to be) are contrary to the Will of GOD, we mu&s;t &s;ay with <HI>Levi,</HI> we <HI>have not known</HI> them; or, agreeable to our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord's Rebuke to <HI>Peter, Get you behind me,</HI> my Adver&s;aries; <HI>for</HI> you <HI>&s;avour not the Things that be of GOD, but the Things that be of Men.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude this Head: We mu&s;t deny our&s;elves in Things indifferent; For it might ea&s;ily be &s;hewn, that as many, if not more, peri&s;h by an immoderate U&s;e of Things in them&s;elves indifferent, as by any gro&s;s Sin whatever. A prudent Chri&s;tian therefore will con&s;ider not only what is <HI>lawful,</HI> but what is <HI>expedient</HI> al&s;o; not &s;o much what Degrees of Self-denial be&s;t &s;uit his Inclinations here, as what will mo&s;t effectually break his Will, and fit him for greater Degrees of Glory hereafter.</P>
<P>BUT, is this the Doctrine of Chri&s;tianity? And is not the Chri&s;tian World then a&s;leep? If not, whence the Self-Indulgence? Whence the reigning Love of Riches which we every where meet with? Above all, whence that predominant Greedine&s;s of &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ure, that has &s;o over-run this &s;inful Nation? that was a pious Stranger to come among us, he would be tempted to think &s;ome Heathen <HI>Venus</HI> was wor&s;hipped here, and that Temples were dedicated to her Service. But we have the Autho|rity of an in&s;pired Apo&s;tle to affirm that they who live in <HI>&s;uch a Round of Plea&s;ure are dead while they live:</HI> Wherefore, as the Holy Gho&s;t &s;aith, <HI>Awake thou that &s;leepe&s;t, and CHRIST &s;hall give thee Light.</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="004449_0011_100D9DD3242B4318">
But the Power of rai&s;ing the &s;piritually Dead be|longeth only unto GOD.
<Q>Do Thou therefore, O Holy JESUS, who by thy almighty Word com|mande&s;t <HI>Lazarus</HI> to come forth, though he had lain in the Grave <HI>&s;o many</HI> Days, &s;peak al&s;o as effectually to the&s;e &s;piritually dead Souls, whom <HI>Satan</HI> for the&s;e many Years has &s;o fa&s;t bound by &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures, that they are not &s;o much as able to lift up their Eyes or Hearts to Heaven.</Q></P>
<P N="2">II. BUT I pa&s;s on to the <HI>Second</HI> general Thing propo&s;ed; <HI>viz.</HI> To con&s;ider the univer&s;al Obliga|tion, and Rea&s;onablene&s;s of this Doctrine of Self-denial.</P>
<P>WHEN our Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter had been di&s;cour&s;ing publickly concerning the Watchfulne&s;s of the <HI>faith|ful and wi&s;e Steward,</HI> his Di&s;ciples a&s;ked him, <HI>Speak|e&s;t thou this Parable to all, or only to us?</HI> The &s;ame Que&s;tion, I am aware, has been, and will be, put concerning the foregoing Doctrine: For too many, unwilling to take CHRIST's ea&s;y Yoke upon them, in order to evade the Force of the Go&s;pel Precepts, would pretend, that all tho&s;e Commands concerning Self-denial, renouncing our&s;elves and the World, be|longed only to our LORD's fir&s;t and immediate Followers, and not <HI>to us or to our Children.</HI> But &s;uch Per&s;ons <HI>greatly err, not knowing the Scriptures,</HI> nor the Power of Godline&s;s in their Hearts. For the Doctrine of JESUS CHRIST, like his Ble&s;&s;ed Self, is <HI>the &s;ame Ye&s;terday, To-day, and for ever.</HI> What he &s;aid unto <HI>one,</HI> he &s;aid unto <HI>all,</HI> even unto the Ends of the World; <HI>If any Man will come after
<PB N="14" REF="004449_0012_100D9DD5359DF3C0">
me, let him deny him&s;elf:</HI> And in the Text it is par|ticularly mentioned that <HI>He &s;aid unto them all.</HI> And le&s;t we &s;hould &s;till ab&s;urdly imagine, that this Word <HI>all</HI> was to be confined to his Apo&s;tles, with whom he was then di&s;cour&s;ing, it is &s;aid in another Place, that JESUS turned unto the Multitude and &s;aid, <HI>If any Man will come after me, and hateth not his Fa|ther and Mother, yea, and his own Life al&s;o, he can|not be my Di&s;ciple.</HI>
<Q>When our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD had &s;poken a certain Parable, it is &s;aid, the Scribes and Phari&s;ees were offended, for they knew the Parable was &s;poken again&s;t them: And if Chri|&s;tians can now read the&s;e plain and po&s;itive Texts of Scripture, and at the &s;ame Time not think they are &s;poken of them, they are more hardened than <HI>Jews,</HI> and more in&s;incere than Phari&s;ees.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Law<HI>'s Chri&s;tian Perfection.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>IN the Former Part of this Di&s;cour&s;e, I ob&s;erved, that the Precepts concerning for&s;aking and &s;elling all did not oblige us in a literal Sen&s;e, becau&s;e, the State of the Church does not demand it of us, as it did of the Primitive Chri&s;tians; but &s;till the &s;ame Deadne&s;s to the World, the &s;ame ab&s;temious U&s;e of, and Readine&s;s to part with our Goods for CHRIST's Sake, is as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for, and as obliga|tory on us, as it was on them. For though the Church may differ as to the outward State of it, in different Ages, yet, as to the Purity of the in|ward State, it was, is, and always will be, invari|ably the &s;ame. And all the Commands, which we meet with in the <HI>Epi&s;tles,</HI> about mortifying our
<PB N="15" REF="004449_0013_100D9DD786DEC230">
Members which are upon the Earth, of &s;etting our Affections on Things above, and of not being con|formed to this World; are but &s;o many inconte&s;ta|ble Proofs that the &s;ame Holine&s;s, Heavenly-minded|ne&s;s, and Deadne&s;s to the World, is as nece&s;&s;ary for us as for our LORD's immediate Followers.</P>
<P>BUT farther, as &s;uch an Objection argues an Igno|rance of the Scriptures, &s;o it is a manife&s;t Proof that &s;uch as make it are Strangers to the Power of Godline&s;s <HI>in their Hearts.</HI> For &s;ince the Sum and Sub&s;tance of Religion con&s;i&s;ts in our Recovery from our fallen E&s;tate in <HI>Adam,</HI> by a New Birth in CHRIST JESUS, there is an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity for us to embrace and practi&s;e the Self-denial before re|commended. Becau&s;e, we have not only a new Hou&s;e to build, but an old one fir&s;t to pull down; we mu&s;t, nece&s;&s;arily, therefore be dead to the World, before we can <HI>live unto GOD.</HI> In &s;hort, all Things belonging to the <HI>Old Man</HI> mu&s;t die in us, before the Things belonging to the <HI>Spirit</HI> can live and grow in us.</P>
<P>WHEN JESUS CHRIST was <HI>about</HI> to make his publick Appearance, and to preach the Glad Tid|ings of Salvation to a benighted World, his Har|binger, <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> was &s;ent <HI>to prepare his Way before him.</HI> In like Manner, when this &s;ame JESUS is about to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Converted Sinner's Heart, <HI>Self-denial,</HI> like <HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> mu&s;t pre|pare the Way before him: For we mu&s;t mourn before we are capable of being comforted; we mu&s;t undergo the <HI>Spirit of Bondage,</HI> in order to be made meet to re|ceive, the <HI>Spirit of Adoption.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="004449_0014_100D9DDAC373ED28">WERE we, indeed, in a State of Innocence, and had we, like <HI>Adam</HI> before his Fall, the Divine Image fully &s;tamped upon our Souls, we then &s;hould have no Need of Self-denial; but &s;ince we are fal|len, &s;ickly, di&s;ordered Creatures, and this Self-&s;uffer|ing, this Self-renunciation is the <HI>indi&s;pen&s;able Means</HI> of <HI>recovering</HI> our Primitive Glory; methinks, in that Ca&s;e, to endeavour to &s;hake off and reject &s;uch a &s;alutary Practice, on Account of the Difficulty at|tending it at fir&s;t, is but too like Ob&s;tinacy of a perver&s;e &s;ick Child, who <HI>nau&s;eates</HI> and <HI>refu&s;es</HI> the Potion reached out to it by a &s;kilful Phy&s;ician or tender Parent, becau&s;e it is a little ungrateful to the Ta&s;te.</P>

How much rather then, when he &s;aith unto thee, Wa&s;h and be clean?</HI> And may not I, very properly, addre&s;s my&s;elf to you in the &s;ame Manner, my Brethren: If JESUS CHRIST, our Great Prophet, had bid you do &s;ome great and very diffi|cult Thing, would you not have done it? much more then &s;hould you do it, when he only bids you deny your&s;elves, what would certainly hurt you, if enjoyed; and behold, you &s;hall be <HI>made perfectly whole.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to illu&s;trate this by another Compari&s;on; In the 12th Chapter of the <HI>Acts,</HI> we read that Saint <HI>Peter was kept in Pri&s;on, and was &s;leeping between two Soldiers, bound with Chains: And behold an Angel of the Lord came upon him, and &s;mote Peter on the Side, &s;aying, Ari&s;e up quickly: and his Chains fell off from his Hands.</HI> But had this great Apo&s;tle, in&s;tead of ri&s;ing up quickly, and doing as the ble&s;&s;ed An|gel commanded him, hugg'd his Chains, and begg'd that they might not be let fall from his Hands, would not any one think that he was in Love with Slavery, and de&s;erved to be <HI>executed</HI> next Morning? And does not the Per&s;on who refu&s;es to deny him|&s;elf,
<PB N="18" REF="004449_0016_100D9DDF8EC68820">
act as incon&s;i&s;tently as this Apo&s;tle would have done, if he had neglected the Means of his Deli|verance? For our Souls, by Nature, are in a &s;piritual Dungeon, &s;leeping and fa&s;t bound between the World, the Fle&s;h, and the Devil, not with Two, but Ten Thou&s;and Chains of Lu&s;ts and Corruptions. Now JESUS CHRIST, like St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s good Angel, by his Go&s;pel comes and opens the Pri&s;on Door, pre|&s;cribes Self-denial, Mortification, and Renunciation of our&s;elves and the World, as &s;o many &s;piritual Keys which will unlock our <HI>Shackles,</HI> make them fall off from our Hearts, and &s;o re&s;tore <HI>us</HI> to the <HI>Glorious Liberty of the Sons of GOD.</HI> But if we will not ari&s;e quickly, <HI>gird up the Loins of our Mind,</HI> and deny our&s;elves, as he has commanded; Are we not in love with Bondage, and de&s;erve never to be <HI>delivered</HI> from it?</P>
<P>INDEED, I will not affirm that this Doctrine of Self-denial appears in this ju&s;t Light to every one. No, I am &s;en&s;ible that to the <HI>Natural Man,</HI> it is <HI>Fooli&s;hne&s;s</HI>; and to the <HI>Young Convert, an hard Saying.</HI> But what &s;ays our Saviour? <HI>If any Man will do my Will, he &s;hall know of the Doctrine whether it be of GOD, or whether I &s;peak of my&s;elf.</HI> This, my dear Friends, is the be&s;t, the only Way of Conviction: Let us up and be doing: Let us ari&s;e quickly and deny our&s;elves, and the Lord JESUS will remove tho&s;e Scales from the Eyes of our Mind, which now like &s;o many Veils, hinder <HI>us</HI> from &s;eeing clearly the Rea&s;onablene&s;s, Nece&s;&s;ity, and inexpre&s;&s;ible Ad|vantage of the Doctrine that has been now delivered. Let us but once thus <HI>&s;hew our&s;elves Men,</HI> and then
<PB N="19" REF="004449_0017_100D9DE1C8155218">
the <HI>Spirit of GOD</HI> will <HI>move</HI> on the Face of our Souls, as he did once <HI>upon the Face of the</HI> great <HI>Deep</HI>; and cau&s;e them to emerge out of that con|fu&s;ed Chaos, in which they are mo&s;t certainly now involved, if we are Strangers and Enemies to <HI>Self-denial</HI> and <HI>the Cro&s;s of CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding this Doctrine of <HI>Self-denial is,</HI> when rightly under&s;tood, &s;o rea&s;onable and bene|ficial; yet many, it is to be feared, like the young Man in the Go&s;pel, are ready to go away &s;orrow|ful.</P>
<P N="3">III. PROCEED we, therefore, now to the <HI>Third</HI> and <HI>la&s;t</HI> general Thing propo&s;ed; <HI>viz.</HI> To offer &s;ome Con&s;iderations which may &s;erve as &s;o many Motives to reconcile us to, and <HI>quicken us</HI> in the Practice of this Duty of <HI>Self-denial.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. AND the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Means I &s;hall recommend to you, in order to reconcile you to this Doctrine, is, to meditate frequently on the Life of our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Ma&s;ter JESUS CHRIST. Oh! may we <HI>often</HI> think on Him, our Grand Exemplar! follow him from his Cradle to his Cro&s;s, and &s;ee what a <HI>&s;elf-denying Life</HI> He lead! And &s;hall not <HI>we drink of the Cup that He drank of, and be baptized with the Bapti&s;m that He was baptized with?</HI> Or think we, that JESUS CHRIST did and &s;uffered every Thing in Order to have us excu&s;ed, and exempted from Sufferings? No, far be it from any &s;incere Chri&s;tian to judge after this Manner! For St. <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, <HI>He &s;uffered for us, leaving us an Example,
<PB N="20" REF="004449_0018_100D9DE447E20160">
that we &s;hould follow his Steps.</HI> Had CHRIST, in|deed, like <HI>tho&s;e that &s;at in Mo&s;es's Chair, laid heavy Burthens</HI> of <HI>Self-denial</HI> upon us (&s;uppo&s;ing they were heavy, which they are not) and refu&s;ed to <HI>touch them him&s;elf with one of his Fingers</HI>&punc; we might have had &s;ome Pretence to complain; but &s;ince He has enjoined us nothing, but what he has fir&s;t put in Prac|tice him&s;elf, <HI>Thou art inexcu&s;able,</HI> O Di&s;ciple, <HI>who|ever thou art,</HI> who woulde&s;t be above thy per&s;ecuted &s;elf-denying Ma&s;ter: And thou art no good and faithful Servant, who art unwilling to &s;uffer and &s;ym|pathize with thy mortified, heavenly-minded LQRD.</P>
<P N="2">2. NEXT to the Pattern of our Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, think often on the Lives of the glorious Company of the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> the goodly Fellow&s;hip of the <HI>Pro|phets,</HI> and the noble Army of <HI>Martyrs</HI>; who, by a con&s;tant <HI>looking to the Author and Fini&s;her of our Faith, have fought the good Fight, and are gone be|fore us to inherit the Promi&s;es.</HI> View, again and again, how holily, how &s;elf-denyingly, how unblame|ably they lived: And if Self-denial was nece&s;&s;ary for them, why not for us al&s;o? Are we not Men of like Pa&s;&s;ions <HI>with them?</HI> Do we not live in the &s;ame wicked World as they did? Have we not the &s;ame Good Spirit to a&s;&s;i&s;t, &s;upport, and purify us, as they had? And is not the &s;ame Eternal Inhe|ritance reached out, as a Reward of our Self-denial and Renunciation of the World, as was offered to them? And if we have the &s;ame Nature to change&punc; the &s;ame wicked World to with&s;tand, the &s;ame Good Spirit to help, and the &s;ame Eternal Crown to reward our Obedience; why &s;hould we not lead
<PB N="21" REF="004449_0019_100D9DE75CE3D7F0">
the &s;ame Lives as they did? Do we think They did Works of Supererogation? If not, why don't we do as they did? Or why does the Church &s;et apart Fe&s;tivals to commemorate the Deaths and Suf|ferings of the Saints, but in order to excite us <HI>to follow them as they did CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THIRDLY, Think often on the Pains of Hell: Con&s;ider whether it is not better to cut off a Right Hand or Foot, and pluck out a Right Eye, if they offend us (or cau&s;e us to &s;in) <HI>rather than to be ca&s;t into Hell, into the Fire that never &s;hall be quenched; where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</HI> Think how many Thou&s;ands there are now re&s;erved, with damned Spirits, in Chains of Darkne&s;s unto the <HI>Judgment of the Great Day,</HI> for not complying with the Precept in the Text. And think withal that This, this mu&s;t be our own Ca&s;e &s;hortly, unle&s;s we are wi&s;e in Time, and &s;ubmit to tho&s;e ea&s;y Conditions our Saviour has pre&s;cribed us, in Order to avoid it. Think you they now imagine JESUS CHRIST to be an hard Ma&s;ter; or rather think you not they would give Ten thou|&s;and times ten thou&s;and Worlds, could they but re|turn to Life again, and take CHRIST's ea&s;y Yoke upon them? And can <HI>we</HI> dwell with everla&s;ting Burnings more than <HI>they?</HI> No; if we cannot bear this Precept, <HI>Come, deny your&s;elves, take up your Cro&s;&s;es,</HI> How &s;hall we bear that irrevocable Sen|tence, <HI>Depart from me, ye Cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels?</HI> But I hope tho&s;e, among&s;t whom I am now preaching the Kingdom of GOD, are not &s;o di&s;ingenuous as to
<PB N="22" REF="004449_0020_100D9DE919B38760">
need to be driven to their Duty by the Terrors of the LORD, but rather de&s;ire to be drawn by the Cords of Love.</P>
<P>LASTLY, therefore, and to conclude,&mdash;Often me|ditate on the Joys of Heaven: Think, think, with what un&s;peakable Glory tho&s;e happy Souls are now incircled, who, when on Earth, were called to deny them&s;elves as well as we, and were not di&s;obedient to that Call: Lift up your Hearts frequently to|ward the Man&s;ions of eternal Bli&s;s, and with an Eye of Faith, like the great Saint <HI>Stephen,</HI> &s;ee the Heavens opened, and the Son of Man with his glorious Retinue of departed Saints, &s;itting and &s;o|lacing them&s;elves in eternal Joys, and with un&s;peak|able Comfort looking back on their pa&s;t Sufferings and Self-denials, as &s;o many glorious Means which exalted them to <HI>&s;uch a Crown.</HI> Hark! methinks I hear them chanting forth their everla&s;ting <HI>Halelujahs,</HI> and &s;pending an eternal Day in ecchoing forth tri|umphant Songs of Joy. And do you not long, my Brethren, to join this heavenly Choir? Do not your Hearts burn within you? <HI>As the Hart panteth after the Water Brooks,</HI> do not our Souls <HI>&s;o long after</HI> the ble&s;&s;ed Company of the&s;e <HI>Sons of GOD?</HI> Behold then a heavenly Ladder reached down to you, by which you may climb to this Holy Hill. <HI>If any Man will come after</HI> them, <HI>let him deny him&s;elf and follow</HI> them. It was this, my Brethren, exalted the Holy JESUS Him&s;elf, as Man, to &s;it at the Right Hand of his adorable Father. By this alone every Saint that ever lived, <HI>a&s;cended into the Joy of their LORD:</HI> And by <HI>this</HI> we, even <HI>we</HI> al&s;o, may be
<PB N="23" REF="004449_0021_100D9DEB54182658">
lifted up into the &s;ame mo&s;t bli&s;sful Regions, there to enjoy an eternal Re&s;t with the People of GOD, and join with them in &s;inging <HI>Doxologies</HI> and <HI>Songs of Prai&s;e,</HI> to the Everla&s;ting, Ble&s;&s;ed, All-glorious, mo&s;t Adorable Trinity, for ever and ever.</P>
