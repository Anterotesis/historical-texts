<P>OF all other crimes, <HI>ingratitude</HI> is the ba&s;e&s;t, mo&s;t mean, and contemptible. It is degrading to the human character. It is unworthy of connection with the exalted di&s;po&s;itions of rational beings. It argues a want of feeling&mdash;a want of goodne&s;s, of hone&s;ty, and ju&s;tice. The common opinion of mankind reprobates the principle;&mdash;but although univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed, it is too <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></P>

Let it be mentioned to the honor of human nature, that there are many in&s;tances of GRATITUDE, and even di&s;intere&s;ted bene|volence, that have, and ought to be re|corded. It would be painful to read every page of hi&s;tory filled with in&s;tances of <HI>ingratitude,</HI> if we could not place again&s;t them many in&s;tances of humanity, charity, and gratitude. Hi&s;tory is replete with in|&s;tances of characters of extraordinary worth&mdash;the names of per&s;ons of the mo&s;t amiable and re&s;pectable characters. The &s;acred, volumes&mdash;the trea&s;ures of divine truth were written for our in&s;truction.

<P>HAPPY would it have been for mankind, had &s;uch characters been more univer&s;al, and &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions more predominant in the world: Had this been the ca&s;e always, un&s;u&s;pecting innocence would never have been deceived by tho&s;e, from whom grati|titude and friend&s;hip was due, and in whom confidence was repo&s;ed;&mdash;Ingratitude, treachery, and deceit, would have been words without meaning.&mdash;Jo&s;eph would not

<P>HOWEVER great the crime of ingratitude is, when man is guilty of it, towards man, it is more reprehen&s;ible, and of greater magnitude, when men are guilty of it to|wards God: And this the I&s;raelites are charged with in the text,&mdash;"THEY RE|MEMBERED NOT HIS HAND, NOR THE DAY WHEN HE DELIVERED THEM FROM THE ENEMY."</P>
<P>THE general conduct of the I&s;raelites is a continued hi&s;tory of repeated in&s;tances of ingratitude towards their God&mdash;their pre&s;erver&mdash;deliverer and friend. They were cho&s;en by God as a favorite people&mdash;di&s;tinct from all other nations, and enjoying the ble&s;&s;ings of heaven in a remarkable manner. They experienced the extraordi|nary interpo&s;ition of God&mdash;in his provi&s;ion for them, and in his deliverance of them,
<PB N="7" REF="029019_0006_0FDE96BA1D0B7878">
from &s;lavery and bondage. "I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt and out of the hou&s;e of bon|dage,"&mdash;was con&s;idered as a principal mo|tive to obedience. A recognition of their deliverance, would have called forth their gratitude, but they did not, they would not <HI>remember.</HI> Their oppre&s;&s;ion in the land of Egypt was &s;o grievous and intolerable, that when Mo&s;es announced unto them the me&s;&s;age of God, concerning their intended deliverance, "they hearkened not, for an|gui&s;h of &s;pirit, and for cruel bondage." Slavery has a tendency to dull the mind, and &s;tupify the &s;en&s;es&mdash;and &s;o it was with the I&s;raelites, that a few days after their de|parture from their place of bondage&mdash;they remon&s;trated with Mo&s;es, "wherefore ha&s;t thou dealt thus with us, to carry us out of Egypt. Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord, in the land of Egypt, when we &s;at by the fle&s;h-pots, and when we did eat bread to the full&mdash;for ye have brought us forth into this wilderne&s;s to kill
<PB N="8" REF="029019_0007_0FDE96C06CC4EC18">
this whole a&s;&s;embly with hunger." Al|though they beheld the power of god in the de&s;truction of their "ta&s;k-ma&s;ters" in the Red Sea&mdash;yet they murmured for want of bread. Although they were fed in a mira|culous manner with manna from heaven, yet they murmured for water&mdash;although they were &s;upplied by water from a flinty rock, yet they tempted the Lord with words of contempt "Is the Lord among us or not."</P>
<P>IN order to give a further di&s;play of his power, the Almighty delivers to the I&s;rael|ites the law, from Mount Sinai, with thun|derings, lightning, and the noi&s;e of the trumpet&mdash;and after he had enjoined &s;ome ceremonial ob&s;ervances, for the regulation of their conduct, he &s;ays, "and I will dwell among the children of I&s;rael, and will be their God, and they &s;hall know, that I am the Lord their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among&s;t them; I am the Lord their God."</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="029019_0008_0FDE96C1F61542B8">IT might have been expected from the&s;e in&s;tances of divine favour, that the I&s;rael|ites would not readily forget their God, their deliverer, and lawgiver; yet God's attention to, and care of them, is not more remarkable than their <HI>ingratitude.</HI> In the ab&s;ence of Mo&s;es they made a molten calf, and &s;aid "The&s;e be thy Gods O I&s;rael which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt!" They went a whoring after other Gods&mdash;yet their God did not for&s;ake them, but continued to conduct them through the wilderne&s;s, by a mighty hand and out|&s;tretched arm&mdash;when they were brought to the borders of the promi&s;ed land&mdash;they murmured again&s;t Mo&s;es and Aaron, &s;ay|ing, "Would God we had died in the land of Egypt, or would God we had died in this wilderne&s;s; and they &s;aid one to ano|ther, let us make a captain, and let us re|turn into Egypt." They were &s;o full of <HI>ingratitude,</HI> and &s;o ob&s;tinately wicked, that they would rather &s;erve the Egyptians and be <HI>&s;laves,</HI> as &s;erve the Lord and be <HI>free.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="029019_0009_0FDE96C4038569B8">
Thus we &s;ee, and mankind in all ages have learned, by mi&s;erable experience, that a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ubmit to, or abet in, the promoting of &s;lavery, is founded on, and derived from the gro&s;&s;e&s;t perver&s;ion and corruption of human nature&mdash;to &s;ubmit to <HI>tyranny</HI> is to encourage idolatry, and to promote <HI>&s;lavery</HI> is to promote <HI>&s;piritual wick|edne&s;s in high places.</HI> There is &s;omething remarkable in preferring &s;lavery, and bon|dage, to rational liberty, and freedom, which is the natural wi&s;h, and de&s;ire of the human mind; this di&s;po&s;ition to &s;lave|ry cannot ea&s;ily be accounted for, unle&s;s we con&s;ider it as proceeding from <HI>a deter|mined oppo&s;ition to the will of God:</HI> This we may &s;uppo&s;e from the conduct of the I&s;|raelites, they frequently felt the &s;everity of God's judgments, yet they did not fear him&mdash;they were frequently delivered by him from their enemies yet they did not love him&mdash;they pre&s;erred the &s;ervice of idols to the &s;ervice of God&mdash;their language was "who is the Lord that he &s;hould reign

over us." They &s;acrificed unto idols and not unto God&mdash;they provoked the Lord to jealou&s;y with &s;trange Gods. After they had obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>promi&s;ed land,</HI> and re&s;ted from a &s;tate of warfare with the neighbouring nations, their <HI>ingratitude</HI> to God, is no le&s;s apparent; their neglect of God brought them in &s;ubjection to the king of Hazor, by whom they were mightily oppre&s;&s;ed for twenty years, afterwards by Midian for &s;even years. They were deli|vered by the general&s;hip of Gideon&mdash;who was an in&s;trument in the hand of God for that purpo&s;e. But in&s;tead of being thank|ful to God for their deliverance, they a&s;|cribe all to Gideon and offer to reward him with what they had no right to be&s;tow, their propo&s;al was to make him king. "Rule thou over us, thou, and thy &s;on, and thy &s;on's &s;on."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">JUDGES 8th. and 22d.</NOTE> His an&s;wer to their propo&s;al was &s;ufficient to have convinced them of their ingratitude to God. "I will not rule over you, neither &s;hall my &s;on
<PB N="12" REF="029019_0011_0FDE96CD346A7CD0">
rule over you, THE LORD SHALL RULE OVER YOU." The&s;e words require no comment, they are plain, and &s;ufficiently explicit.</P>
<P>IN the days of Samuel although they en|joyed the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, having obtain|ed a decided victory over the Phili&s;tines under the hand of God who de&s;troyed them with thunder&mdash;yet they neglected the true God and remembered not his deliver|ance of them. They murmured again&s;t Samuel's &s;ons for which there might have been &s;ome rea&s;ons as they were neither ho|ne&s;t nor impartial in the di&s;tributing of judgment.&mdash;But they did not re&s;t here&mdash;they a&s;ked for a king that they might be like all the nations&mdash;this reque&s;t was di&s;|plea&s;ing both to Samuel and God. "And the Lord &s;aid unto Samuel they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I &s;hould not reign over them," from which we &s;ee that <HI>all tho&s;e who wi&s;h for an earthly &s;overeign, abjure the &s;overeignty of
<PB N="13" REF="029019_0012_0FDE96CEDB76BF18">
God.</HI> Samuel endeavored to di&s;&s;uade them from per&s;i&s;ting in their fooli&s;h wi&s;hes&mdash;he informed them that a king would en&s;lave, and oppre&s;s them, but they refu&s;ed to obey his voice and &s;aid, "nay, but we will have a king to reign over us," that we may al&s;o be like all the nations, that our king may judge us, and go out before us and fight our battles."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Read the 8th. Chap. of the 1&s;t. Book of SAMUEL</NOTE> I &s;hall only remark, that however natural it was for the I&s;raelites to wi&s;h to have their battles fought for them, e&s;pecially as they were fatigued with fight|ing, yet we do not find that kings have come up to their expectations herein, for in&s;tead of fighting the battles of the peo|ple, we find by bloody experience that the people have been <HI>obliged</HI> to fight <HI>the battles of kings!</HI></P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of kings can &s;hew too well the fulfilling of Samuel's prophecy "And ye &s;hall cry out in that day becau&s;e of your king which ye &s;hall have cho&s;en you&mdash;and
<PB N="14" REF="029019_0013_0FDE96D08B40E7B8">
the Lord will not hear you in that day." This affords ground for an ob&s;ervation which may be extended to all men, that the greate&s;t puni&s;hment God inflicted on the I&s;raelites, was in &s;atisfying all their wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>WHEN we read in &s;acred &s;cripture an ac|count of the general conduct of the kings of I&s;rael of many of their bloody di&s;po&s;i|tions and <HI>wicked reigns,</HI> and compare their conduct with tho&s;e who have a&s;pired to as great, if not greater power, in every &s;ub|&s;equent period of the hi&s;tory of the world&mdash;we cannot avoid lamenting the folly and wickedne&s;s of men, who allow them to rule and oppre&s;s them. It was in God's wrath the fir&s;t king was given&mdash;and it is for the puni&s;hment of men, they have been conti|nued. But as the effect cea&s;es when the cau&s;e cea&s;es to operate&mdash;&s;o, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that the puni&s;hment would cea&s;e when the crime which puni&s;hes it&s;elf would cea&s;e and determine.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="029019_0014_0FDE96D210E827D0">WE have thus far taken a general view of the conduct of the I&s;raelites, from their departure from the land of bondage, until they entered into the promi&s;ed land&mdash;un|gratefully rejected the authority of the king of Heaven, and obtained an earthly king to reign over them. The words of the text lead us to enquire into the particular charg|es which the p&s;almi&s;t here makes again&s;t them&mdash;AND FIRST&mdash;"They remember|ed not his hand." In the government of the univer&s;e God's agency is vi&s;ibly di&s;|played. It is not &s;ufficient to &s;ay that every event is brought about by <HI>general</HI> cau&s;es&mdash;and that the world is governed by <HI>general</HI> laws. God exerci&s;es a <HI>particular</HI> govern|ment. This is evident from particular in|&s;tances of effects brought about contrary to the <HI>general</HI> laws of nature and providence; a wi&s;e ob&s;erver of human nature and of the ways of God hath informed us&mdash;that the race is not to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong neither yet bread to the wi&s;e, nor

<P>Although &s;uch extraordinary miracles are not now performed, nor perhaps &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary,&mdash;we can &s;till trace God's over-ruling Providence, and the wonders of his hand.&mdash;The revolutions which take place in the Political, as well as in the Natural World, are all the effect of God's wi&s;dom and power. To forget God and deny his Pro|vidence,&mdash;to a&s;cribe &s;ucce&s;s to human wi&s;|dom&mdash;to the arm of fle&s;h and not to the mighty <HI>hand</HI> of God, is the ba&s;e&s;t <HI>ingrati|tude.</HI> Alas! What is man when compar|ed with God? Or what avails the power of man, when compared with the power of God? If events were the re&s;ult of man's wi&s;dom and contrivance how di&s;ordered would the affairs of the univer&s;e appear?
<PB N="18" REF="029019_0017_0FDE96DE8D31BB38">
If God who opens the eyes of the under|&s;tanding and imparts of his wi&s;dom&mdash;would withdraw his influence, the affairs of men would wear an appearance &s;till more di&s;ordered. If God who re&s;trains the wrath of man was to allow it unre&s;trained exer|ci&s;e&mdash;what would the con&s;equence be? The hi&s;tory of the world, is at be&s;t, but a black catalogue of the enormities and vices of men! It &s;erves to &s;hew what men are, even under the government of the Wi&s;e Ruler of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>In the conduct of divine Providence there are many things my&s;terious, many things beyond our comprehen&s;ion. The&s;e things can be but partially under&s;tood here, part will remain to be under&s;tood hereafter,&mdash;Although we are imperfect yet we mu&s;t di&s;cern the operations of God's Providence&mdash;If we a&s;cribe ordinary effects to him as the cau&s;e&mdash;we have much more rea&s;on to con&s;ider him as the cau&s;e of extraordina|ry actions. If David who was but a &s;trip|ling

If the I&s;rae|lites were pre&s;erved from the Egyptians by a pillar of cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night, it was the effect of &s;upernatural power.&mdash;If the &s;ea divided its waters to give them a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age on dry land&mdash;and clo&s;|ed again and overwhelmed the Egyptians&mdash;this cannot be accounted for according to the regular laws of nature, but mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to God's extraordinary power&mdash;If the I&s;raelites who were but a &s;mall na|tion when compared with their enemies, were enabled to e&s;cape from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the Egyptians and to conquer all nations before them, &s;o that they obtained undi&s;|turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land of Canaan, it certainly was very ungrateful in them to a&s;cribe that deliverance and conque&s;t to them&s;elves, yet "they remembered not

his hand" nor SECONDLY "the day when he delivered them from the enemy."</P>
<P>What particular in&s;tance of their delive|rance the P&s;almi&s;t here alludes to we can|not determine. It is more than probable it was their deliverance from Egyptian tyran|ny; the context &s;eems to favor this con|jecture. The P&s;almi&s;t is lamenting their di&s;obedience and <HI>ingratitude.</HI> "How oft did they provoke him in the wilderne&s;s, and grieve him in the de&s;ert, yea they turned back and tempted God, and limited the holy one of I&s;rael. They remembered not his hand nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy; how he had wrought his wonders in Egypt, and his &s;igns in the land of Zoan."</P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;over which is probably here al|luded to, was appointed as a fe&s;tival for the I&s;raelites, on which anniver&s;ary they were to commemorate their miraculous delive|rance out of Egypt, when the de&s;troying
<PB N="21" REF="029019_0020_0FDE96EAF2ABD510">
Angel <HI>pa&s;&s;ed over</HI> the hou&s;es of the children of I&s;rael, but &s;mote all the fir&s;t born of the Egyptians with death. This was a wonderful deliverance, &s;o great, that it might have been rea&s;onably pre&s;umed, there would have been no danger of its being ever forgotten by them. There is nothing more apt to leave a la&s;ting impre&s;|&s;ion on our minds than works which are believed to be &s;upernatural. Hence we find that credulity and ignorance have been the prolific parents of a blind and nume|rous offspring. Super&s;tition and all her votaries, can trace their de&s;cent from this &s;ource. This has given ri&s;e to dei&s;m, and even &s;ceptici&s;m. Becau&s;e &s;ome are too credulous, founding their opinions on the &s;ugge&s;tions of an extravagant fancy, and deluded imagination&mdash;therefore others will &s;carcely believe any thing&mdash;Becau&s;e &s;acred &s;cripture informs us of &s;everal miracles, therefore &s;ome deny its authenticity. Be|cau&s;e they <HI>cannot</HI> under&s;tand, therefore they <HI>will not</HI> believe. The I&s;raelites however,
<PB N="22" REF="029019_0021_0FDE96EC7B67B7C8">
are not charged with unbelief, but with ingratitude.

<P>It is natural for us to be elated with grati|tude to the author of a favour <HI>recently</HI> re|ceived; we e&s;teem a benefactor when a &s;en&s;e of his favors are fre&s;h on the mind; but time with &s;ilent influence, is too apt to wipe off the impre&s;&s;ion; In order to counteract this, we find that God appointed &s;everal days to be held in religious memo|rial by the I&s;raelites, they had certain days appointed for ritual ob&s;ervances, and for commemorating &s;ome remarkable events; for this purpo&s;e was the pa&s;&s;over appointed by an expre&s;s command.
