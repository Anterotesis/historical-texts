</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_SAINT <HI>Paul</HI> by Nation was a <HI>Jew,</HI> by civil Dignity and Pri|vilege he was a <HI>Roman</HI> Citizen, by Profe&s;&s;ion he was a Chri&s;tian, and by Office a Mini&s;ter and an Apo&s;tle of Chri&s;t, and this was his highe&s;t Dignity and Honour. He had been bred a Phari&s;ee, and was an eager and violent Per&s;ecutor of the Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e, but after his Conver&s;ion, he was an ardent and zealous Promoter and Preacher of that Faith which once he de&s;troyed; which laid him open and expos'd him, to the furious Re&s;ent|ment and Rage of his Countrymen the <HI>Jews,</HI> who now ro&s;e upon him, in a riotous and tu|multuous
<PB N="6" REF="008386_0005_102F1A7EAF3D6A10">
Manner, in the Temple, whil&s;t he was peaceably employed there&mdash;apprehended him, beat and abu&s;ed him, in a very injuri|ous and &s;hameful Manner, 'till he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by the Chief Captain with a Band of Soldiers, and ordered to be carried into the Ca&s;tle; and being come upon the Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, he there &s;tood, and having obtain'd Leave, he made admi|rable Defence of him&s;elf, by a particular Re|cital of the Manner of his pa&s;t Life, and the wonderful Circum&s;tances of his Conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity: where upon the <HI>Jews</HI> were filled with accumulated Fury and Rage; they lift up their Voices&mdash;away with this Fellow from the Earth&mdash;they cried out, and ca&s;t Du&s;t into the Air. In the mid&s;t of this riotous up|roar, when &s;ome cried one thing, and &s;ome a|nother, among the Multitude, the chief Cap|tain commanded him to be brought into the Ca&s;tle, &amp; ordered that he &s;hould be examined by Scourging, that if po&s;&s;ible he might find out what the Bu&s;ine&s;s was, and wherefore they they thus cried out again&s;t him, pre&s;uming that by this Method, he might extort a true Con|fe&s;&s;ion: accordingly they bound him with Thongs. At this critical Juncture, Saint <HI>Paul</HI>'s Freedom &amp; civil Immunities, as a Citizen of <HI>Rome,</HI> were of great Advantage to him: He &s;ays to the Centurion that &s;tood by v. 25. is it lawful for You to Scourge a Man that is a
<PB N="7" REF="008386_0006_102F1A8164572578">
<HI>Roman,</HI> &amp; uncondemened? This Que&s;tion im|ports a &s;trong &amp; clear Negation. The &s;ame Truth likewi&s;e is &s;ugge&s;ted, and weight laid upon it in the Sixteenth Chapter of <HI>Acts,</HI> where we are told, that after <HI>Paul</HI> &amp; <HI>Silas</HI> had been beaten, &amp; ca&s;t into Pri&s;on, the Magi&s;trates &s;ent Word to let them go, in An&s;wer to whom, Saint <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ay v.37. <HI>They have beaten us o|penly uncondemn'd being</HI> Romans, <HI>and have ca&s;t us into Pri&s;on; and now do they thru&s;t us out privily? nay verily, but let them come Them|&s;elves, and fetch us out</HI>&mdash; let them come them|&s;elves, make up the Matter, and di&s;mi&s;s us honourably.</P>
<P>THE Freedom of <HI>Rome</HI> and a Right to the Privileges &amp; Immunities of that State was ac|counted an high, di&s;tingui&s;hing Honor. I &s;hall not undertake to give a particular Detail of tho&s;e Privileges: &s;ome of them are menti|on'd here, which I &s;hall take &s;ome Notice of. Saint <HI>Paul</HI> here complains, that he was Puni&s;h|ed uncondemned &amp; without a Tryal: now, it was contrary to the Laws of the <HI>Romans,</HI> and &s;o it is to the Laws of all well regulated States &amp; Kingdoms, to condemn or puni&s;h a Man without a fair, impartial Tryal, and the Accu&s;ers &amp; Accu&s;ed had Face to Face, &amp; the accu&s;ed have Liberty to an&s;wer for and defend him&s;elf: but in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, Saint <HI>Paul</HI> had had no Tryal at all, but they fell upon
<PB N="8" REF="008386_0007_102F1A82EEF09618">
and abus'd him, in a riotous, tumultuary Man|ner, which was a direct Violation, not only of the Laws of common Ju&s;tice &amp; Equity, but of his civil Freedom &amp; Immunity as a Citizen of <HI>Rome</HI>: nor was this all, but they had bound and &s;courg'd or beaten him, from both of which he was exempted by the <HI>Roman</HI> Law. To bind or beat a <HI>Roman,</HI> or one who was free of that City, and intitled to the Privileges of it was by no means lawful: hence <HI>Cicero,</HI> in one of his Orations &s;ays, <HI>Facinus e&s;t vinciri Civem Romanum, Scelus verberari,</HI> that is, 'tis a great and heinous Crime, either to bind or beat a <HI>Roman</HI> Citizen: if they were guilty &amp; de&s;erv'd it, they had other Ways of puni&s;hing their Ci|tizens, but Thongs &amp; Whips they accounted too di&s;honourable and &s;hameful Methods of Puni&s;hment, and unbecoming the Dignity of <HI>Roman</HI> Citizens.</P>
<P>No Wonder then the Centurion, when he under&s;tood that Saint <HI>Paul</HI> was a <HI>Roman,</HI> was alarmed at what had been done: he goes &s;traightway to the Chief Captain, and informs him how the Matter &s;tood, and de&s;ires him to take heed what he did: whereupon the Chief Captain went directly to <HI>Paul</HI> and &s;aid, tell me now &s;eriou&s;ly and hone&s;ty, are you a <HI>Ro|man</HI> Citizen, Saint <HI>Paul</HI> an&s;wer'd frankly and truly, yes I am; the chief Captain replys to this Purpo&s;e, in the <HI>Text,</HI> why that &s;eems hard|ly
<PB N="9" REF="008386_0008_102F1A85AC7BB9D0">
probable, from the indifferent Figure and Appearance you now make, unle&s;s there has been &s;ome remarkable Change in your Cir|cum&s;tances; for I, who hold a con&s;iderable Po&s;t in the <HI>Roman</HI> Army, obtain'd that Free|dom at an expen&s;ive Rate, &amp; for a greatSum of Money: <HI>Paul</HI> rejoins, I had no Need of making any &s;uch Purcha&s;e, for I was free-born, born to the Freedom of the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> and all the Privileges and Immunities of it; it de&s;cended to me from my Father, who was a <HI>Roman</HI> Citizen before me.</P>
<P>THERE were &s;everal Ways of becoming free of the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> and being intitled to the Priviliges of it&punc; one was by Purcha&s;e, &s;o the chief Captain was made free: another was by Birth, &s;o <HI>Paul</HI> came by his Freedom: and &s;ome were ve&s;ted &amp; dignified with the&s;e Pri|vileges, in Con&s;equence and Reward of &s;ome &s;ignal Services they had done the <HI>Roman</HI> Go|vernment; in this Way, 'tis probable eno' St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Father become free of <HI>Rome</HI>: for many of the <HI>Jews,</HI> by &s;erving in the <HI>Roman</HI> Army, and &s;ignanzing them&s;elves, were endowed with the Freedom and Immunities of Citizens of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Words, I apprehend, may well eno' give Ri&s;e to a brief Di&s;cour&s;e on <HI>civil Liberty,</HI> and the Privileges, Rights &amp; Immunities that belong to a free State or Government, with a
<PB N="10" REF="008386_0009_102F1A89C043F288">
particular Application of it to this Government.</P>
<P>THE Source and Original of civil Govern|ment, in General, is Divine and from GOD. The mo&s;t high has &s;ufficiently inform'd us in his Word, and from the Nature, Rea&s;on and Nece&s;&s;ity of the Thing, that it is his Plea&s;ure, civil Government &s;hould obtain among the Nation's of the Earth: but he has not &s;een fit to interpo&s;e, and expre&s;ly to fix &amp; determine in his Word, that this or that particular Mo|del or Scheme of civil Rule &amp; Government, &s;hould obtain &amp; be ob&s;erv'd, in this or the o|ther Nation, or in any Nation; but has left that Matter, very much, to the Election and Choice of the &s;everal Communities; or, that Matter is over-ruled by a Train of providen|tial Events, whence the &s;everal Nations and civil States of the Earth, are led to fix and &s;ettle in &s;ome one particular Form of Govern|ment rather than another.</P>
<P>As we in this Colony are dependant upon, and hold the Charter of all our civil Privileges, from the Crown of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> it may not he improper, to take a very brief View of that Kingdom, with it's ine&s;timable Privileges.</P>
<P>GREAT <HI>Britain</HI> is a limitted Monarchy, and is &s;ometimes called, by political Writers, a Republic or Commonwealth, with a Prince at the Head of it: it is governed by Laws of
<PB N="11" REF="008386_0010_102F1A8CC9B57940">
their own making, and both King and People are bound and oblig'd to act and conduct them&s;elves according to the Laws of the Realm. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Legi&s;lature con&s;i&s;ts of three Branches, the King and two Hou&s;es of Parliament, without the Concurrence of each of which, no Laws can be made, and which mutually temper, a&s;&s;i&s;t and check each other.</P>
<P>HISTORIANS tell us, that this Form of Go|vernment, for sub&s;tance, has obtain'd in <HI>Eng|land</HI> from the earlie&s;t Times, and the &s;ame Kind of Government was &s;etled by the Northern Nations, in &s;everal Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> which they over-run in the Decline of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, and founded new States upon its Ruins: but tho&s;e Governments on the Con|tinent, as to the free Form of them, gradually degenerated into de&s;potick and arbitrary; but in, <HI>England,</HI> it has been pre&s;erv'd, &s;ecur'd and improv'd. In the Time of the <HI>Saxon Hep|tarchy,</HI> when <HI>England</HI> was divided into &s;even Kingdoms, the Government was free, and &s;o it was after tho&s;e Kingdoms were united into one: King <HI>William</HI> the fir&s;t, a <HI>Norman,</HI> having conquer'd <HI>England,</HI> near Seven Hundred Years ago indeed e&s;tabli&s;h'd an ab&s;olute Government there; but his Son <HI>William</HI> the &s;econd, to &s;ecure his Crown, &s;olemnly promi&s;ed to re&s;tore the ancient Government and Laws: and the &s;ame Promi&s;es were made by &s;ome of his Suc|ce&s;&s;ors,
<PB N="12" REF="008386_0011_102F1A8EA7B10E78">
but not well perform'd; which bro't on the War of the <HI>Barons,</HI> in which the No|bility and People &s;truggled hard to recover their Liberties, which at length were &s;olemnly confirmed to them, by a Charter, which was called <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> or the Charter of Li|berties, by King <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>SOME Attempts were made, by &s;ome &s;uc|ceeding Princes, to &s;trip the People of their Privileges, or to curtall and le&s;&s;en them; but they ever brought Mi&s;fortunes and Vexatlons upon Them&s;elves, and &s;ometimes the Lo&s;s of theirCrowns, or their Lives. When King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t attempted to introduce arbitrary Go|vernment, it blew up a Civil War, which en|ded in the Lo&s;s of his Head: and when his Son King <HI>James</HI> the Second, took large &s;trides towards arbitrary Rule, the Nation jealous of their Liberties, invited over the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>; upon which King <HI>James</HI> thought fit to abdicate the Throne &amp; Kingdom; and the Crown was Setled on the Prince &amp; Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange,</HI> by the Names of King <HI>Williams</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI>; by who&s;e Means &amp; In|&s;trumentality it was, that the Crown was Set|led on the pre&s;ent Royal Family, which GOD long pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>UPON the Acce&s;&s;ion of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> the Nation a&s;&s;embled in Par|liament, took &s;pecial Care, expre&s;ly to &s;et
<PB N="13" REF="008386_0012_102F1A91748D1830">
down, and &s;olemnly to declare and a&s;&s;ert, the ancient, legal Rights, Liberties &amp; Privileges belonging to the Nation, which have been en|joy'd to this Day, and we hope will long be enjoyed. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">For the Hi&s;torical Facts here related, &s;ee <HI>Rapin's</HI> Hi&s;tory of England.</NOTE></P>
<P>THERE is no Nation now in <HI>Europe,</HI> nor on the Earth, who&s;e Civil Government is like that of Great <HI>Britain</HI>&mdash;none that exceeds, perhaps none, that, in all Re&s;pects, equals it in Excellency. Now, as the Colony of <HI>Con|necticut</HI> is dependant upon, and derives it's Being and all it's Privileges from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown; and free and excellent Form of our Government, pretty nearly re&s;embles that of our Mother-Country. The CHARTER of all our Civil Privileges was granted by King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second: by which Charter, this Colony was made and con&s;tituted a Body Cor|porate or Politick, with all the Rights and Immunities of a free People. The Legi&s;la|ture of the Colony is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and a Me|thod Setled for it's Sub&s;i&s;tence &amp; Perpetuity. The Whole of this Legi&s;lative Body, con&s;i&s;ting of two Hou&s;es, are elected and cho&s;en annually by the free Men of the Corporation; who are under the Solemnity of an Oath, to give their Suffrages, according to their be&s;t Knowlege, in &s;uch a Manner as may conduce

to the be&s;t Good of the Government. In the Hands of this A&s;&s;embly is lodg'd, the Tran&s;|action and Management of the great Affairs of the Government, relating to the Peace, Secu|rity and Pro&s;perity of the whole Body: To them it belongs, to erect and e&s;tabli&s;h Execu|tive Courts, of whatever Denomination, for the Tryal of &s;uch Cau&s;es as may properly fall under their Cognizance; to &s;ettle &amp; fix their Powers, and regulate the Form &amp; Manner of their Proceedings: to them likewi&s;e it belongs, to make and enact Such Laws and Statutes,&mdash;to levy and rai&s;e &s;uch Taxes upon the Com|munity, and impo&s;e &s;uch Cu&s;toms &amp; Duties, as may be needful for the Security of the People in their Lives, Property and Rights, for the Support of Government, &amp; the Peace and Welfare of the State.</P>
<P>Our Governors and Civil Rulers are not obtruded upon us from abroad, nor forced upon us by a Superior Authority: they are all elected &amp; cho&s;en by Our&s;elves, and from among Our&s;elves. The Laws we are under, and which obtain among us, are not the So|vereign Injunctions of an arbitrary Ruler; but they are all Laws of our own making&mdash;all e|nacted and made by Our&s;elves, or by tho&s;e, whom we have cho&s;en to repre&s;ent and act for us: Our Lives and Limbs, our Property and E&s;tates, our Rights and Liberties, our
<PB N="15" REF="008386_0014_102F1A98715C94D8">
Characters and good Names lie at no Man's Mercy; but they are all guarded &amp; &s;ecur'd by Laws: as Strong an Hedge is &s;et around them for their Security &amp; Defence, as we can de&s;ire; for they are &s;creen'd &amp; defended by Laws of our own chu&s;ing &amp; making. And whatever is needful and proper to be done, from Time to Time, for the Suppre&s;&s;ing of Di&s;orders and Immoralities, or Practices and Cour&s;es that are detrimental to the Communi|ty; for the promoting of Virtue and good Manners, Diligence and Indu&s;try, and the general Good, Security &amp; Pro&s;perity of the State; &s;till' this lies with us, and may be done by tho&s;e whom we choo&s;e to rule over us. In a Word, we Our&s;elves elect &amp; chu&s;e tho&s;e, to whom annually the Conduct and Management of the great Affairs of Govern|ment is committed, and who&s;e Duty and Bu&s;ine&s;s it is, to watch for the Security, Peace and Pro&s;perity of the State.</P>
<P>Now, one would be ready to imagine, that the Subjects of &s;uch a Government, of &s;uch rich and di&s;tingui&s;hing Privileges &amp; Immuni|ties, &s;hould be all Gratitude and Thankfulne&s;s to God, for his merciful Indulgence and di&s;|criminating Favours&mdash;all Chearfulne&s;s and A|lacrity in obeying &amp; honouring the Laws, and &s;ubmitting to the Admini&s;trations of &s;uch a Government: but the mo&s;t valuable &amp; Ex|cellent

Things in the World, are capable of being perverted and abu&s;ed; and &s;o are the Civil Freedom &amp; Privileges of this Colony.</P>
<P>PERVERSE &amp; di&s;ingenuous Spirits, unrea|&s;onable &amp; unthinking Men, by ba&s;king long in the Sun &s;hine of Liberty, and indulg'd to the full with the riche&s;t Political Privileges, and unacquainted with the oppo&s;ite &s;tate and &s;ituation, are ready &s;ometimes to flight and de&s;pite their Freedom, and turn their Political Grace and Favour into Wantonne&s;s: and if all the Public Affairs are not ordered &amp; con|ducted, in a Manner that &s;uits their Humours, how unrea&s;onable &s;oever; or, if they feel a Burden heavier than common, at an extra|ordinary Juncture&mdash;a Burden ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to the Security and Defence, not of their civil Liberties &amp; Property only, but of their Religion &amp; Lives, are ready to imagine their Freedom &amp; Liberties are worth Nothing at all; to murmur &amp; complain; to call for Chains &amp; Shackles, to cur&s;e their Benefactors, revile the Gods, and Speak Evil of Dignities, and with tremendous Ra&s;hne&s;s, to cen&s;ure and condemn the whole Legi&s;lative Body of the Colony, and reproach &amp; vilify their Admi|ni&s;trations. I hope indeed there are few if any Such Murmurers &amp; Complainers in this numerous A&s;&s;embly. We are called indeed to Liberty, but not to Licentiou&s;ne&s;s; we
