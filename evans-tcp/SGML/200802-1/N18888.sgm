<OPENER><SALUTE>FATHERS AND FELLOW CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THAT the religion of Je&s;us is the greate&s;t ornament of our nature, and a &s;ource of &s;ublime plea&s;ures to men, will not be denied, by any, who know its author, under&s;tand its nature, or have felt its happy effects. The influence of chri&s;|tianity has the directe&s;t tendency to correct the errors of the heart, and to make the life better. Its doctrines and precepts are calculated to make us what we &s;hould be, to God, our&s;elves, and our fellow-men, in every relation of human life.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="024563_0005_0FC7BE114B57F9F8">
IT is, notwith&s;tanding, very apparent, that, through the malignity of its oppo&s;ers, chri&s;tianity has been loaded with reproach|es and calumnies; and <HI>e&s;pecially</HI> with the odium of being unfriendly to peace and good government, and an enemy to Cae&s;ar. Hence, the public in&s;tructors of this reli|gion, were &s;tigmatized with every oppro|brious character; as turbulent fellows, &s;owers of &s;edition and &s;trife, and treated by &s;ome, as common enemies to mankind.</P>
<P>THESE calumnies were greatly occa&s;ion|ed by the rigorous attachment of the Jews to a &s;y&s;tem of ceremonial ob&s;ervances; in oppo&s;ition to which, and agreeably to the purity and plainne&s;s of go&s;pel wor&s;hip, the apo&s;tles taught a glorious liberty in Chri&s;t, and charged chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors not to be entangled again with that yoke of bondage.</P>
<P>To wipe away the odium of the&s;e groundle&s;s a&s;&s;ertions from the be&s;t of cau&s;es, and to prevent a mi&s;con&s;truction of that liberty into licentiou&s;ne&s;s, which
<PB N="7" REF="024563_0006_0FC7BE12F15F9660">
the apo&s;tles had preached among the peo|ple; the author of this epi&s;tle takes occa|&s;ion, in the chapter where our text is re|corded, to enjoin &s;ubjection to civil govern|ment on all cla&s;&s;es of men: and he enfor|ces this duty, from the important con&s;ider|ation of its being an ordinance of God. Hence, "Let every &s;oul be &s;ubject to the higher powers; for there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God."</P>
<P>THUS, though civil government be a na|tural ordinance, it is al&s;o of divine appoint|ment: therefore &s;ubjection to it, is enjoin|ed, not only "for wrath," or fear of pun|i&s;hment; but from chri&s;tian motives, and "for con&s;cience &s;ake."</P>
<P>I PRESUME that the apo&s;tle does not <HI>here</HI> treat of the form of government, nor of the manner in which per&s;ons ought to be inve&s;ted with power; but of the origin and ri&s;e of government it&s;elf; which he &s;ays is of God, and ordained by him.&mdash;Sometimes the way, in which per&s;ons arrive at pow|er,
<PB N="8" REF="024563_0007_0FC7BE1632F810B0">
is by u&s;urpation and oppre&s;&s;ion; and &s;uch generally govern in a tyrannical and oppre&s;&s;ive manner. This was the ca&s;e at the time to which our text and context re|fer. This is no otherwi&s;e of God; than as he permits it, for the puni&s;hment of national offences again&s;t him&s;elf. And though it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that people have a perfect right to reform &s;uch a government at plea&s;ure; yet when the means of refor|mation and &s;uch as would ju&s;tify re&s;i&s;tance are not at all in their power, it is then their duty to &s;ubmit &s;o far, as may not of|fend con&s;cience; becau&s;e government in &s;ome &s;hape or other, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry to the exi&s;tence of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e we may &s;uppo&s;e, the apo&s;tle &s;poke, when he &s;aid, "The powers that be, are ordained of God: and who&s;o|ever re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordi|nance of God: and &s;hall receive to them|&s;elves damnation."</P>
<P>THE &s;criptures do not &s;eem to direct men, to any one particular mode or form of
<PB N="9" REF="024563_0008_0FC7BE1799986610">
government, the exclu&s;ion of others. We are left to make choice of that mode of go|vernment, that may be mo&s;t agreeable to our own minds; whether Monarchy, Ari&s;|tocracy, or Democracy. The dictates of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e teach us, that all men are originally equal and free&punc; that by the voice of the people, which we are to revere as the voice of God; &s;ome men ought to be rai&s;ed from the common level and inve&s;ted with power, to act in the ca|pacity of Rulers.</P>
<P>THE &s;acred page is very explicit in af|fording us information concerning the &s;ource of civil authority, which is of God: and concerning its end among men, which is their good: hence Rulers are called God's mini&s;ters, and his mini&s;ters for good: and la&s;tly concerning our duty to govern|ment; which is &s;ubjection to it, and honor to its admini&s;trators. Agreeably to this view, the apo&s;tle farther enforces our duty to government by the words of our text; which informs us, what rulers are in the end and ought to be in the exerci&s;e of their
<PB N="10" REF="024563_0009_0FC7BE1C4F2F9A90">
office. FOR RULERS ARE NOT A TERROR TO GOOD WORKS, BUT TO THE EVIL.&mdash;They are a terror, but not to good men. Whatever terror may appear about civil government, there is nothing in its genu|ine nature and de&s;ign, of which a virtuous and well doing citizen need be afraid. Ru|lers are a terror to bad members of &s;ociety only. The nece&s;&s;ity of civil Government ari&s;es from the wickedne&s;s of men. Di&s;|orderly per&s;ons are enemies to &s;ociety; their conduct tends to injure mankind, and to di&s;&s;olve the &s;ocial union. Rulers are ap|pointed for the protection of mankind, and the pre&s;ervation of the &s;ocial union; therefore they are a terror to di&s;orderly per&s;ons only.</P>
<P>CIVIL <HI>Fathers</HI> of the State, I am well convinced I have not been invited to this de&s;k to explain State policy, or to inve&s;ti|gate the government of nations. Any at|tempt of this kind would be arrogance in <HI>me,</HI> and a reflection upon the profe&s;&s;ional knowledge of the leaders of New-Hamp|&s;hire. I hope therefore, I &s;hall not be un|der&s;tood
<PB N="11" REF="024563_0010_0FC7BE20D77449A8">
in that unfavorable light, while I beg leave to &s;ubmit to your candid atten|tion, a few ob&s;ervations, in which I &s;hall endeavor to &s;how, how, or by what means, Rulers are a terror to bad members of &s;o|ciety, and to them only. After which, I &s;hall conclude, with &s;ome <HI>&s;uitable</HI> improve|ment. I proceed then to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> THAT a good plan of government greatly tends to make rulers a terror to bad members of &s;ociety, and to them only.</P>
<P>WHEN a con&s;titution is founded on the true principles of moral government, the exi&s;tence of a God, and the propriety of religious wor&s;hip and formed according to the principles of equal liberty; virtuous rulers act with freedom and &s;pirit again&s;t vice; virtuous citizens are encouraged; and the vicious part of &s;ociety alone, are di&s;mayed, and fear the con&s;equences of &s;uch a fair foundation, for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of immorality and vice.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="024563_0011_0FC7BE237179BDB0">
WHEN there are any remarkable defects in a form of government, bad men have their eyes fixed on tho&s;e, as open, though back doors, at which they e&s;cape with im|punity, in the practice of vice. Every good man, can boldly plead the benefits, and advantages of a good con&s;titution; and the ruler can with grace and propriety, protect him in the enjoyment of them. On the other hand, bad men are ever ready to plead the defects, and greate&s;t imperfecti|ons of a bad con&s;titution, in favor of their licentious conduct; and in &s;uch ca&s;es, it is not always po&s;&s;ible, nor ea&s;y at any time for the mo&s;t virtuous rulers on earth to prevent bad con&s;equences.</P>
<P>THE baneful influence of a bad plan of government &s;eldom opens the door, for one &s;pecies of oppre&s;&s;ion, and inju&s;tice, alone. Per&s;ecution for con&s;cience &s;ake, oppre&s;&s;ion in civil liberty, with acts of common in|ju&s;tice, and private injury, generally go together. They flow from the &s;ame &s;ource; are carried on by the &s;ame means; and are
<PB N="13" REF="024563_0012_0FC7BE274FFF7580">
equally &s;ub&s;ervient in their turn, to the &s;ame wicked purpo&s;es of de&s;igning men.</P>
<P>A GOOD con&s;titution is formed for the pre&s;ervation of men in their natural rights, and is calculated to &s;ecure them again&s;t the mo&s;t di&s;tant fears of an inva&s;ion, upon what is valuable to men; whether as mem|bers of civil, or religious &s;ociety, and is the be&s;t and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary foundation for the formation of good laws. Which in the</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d.</HI> PLACE, are equally nece&s;&s;ary to en|able rulers to be a terror to di&s;orderly members of &s;ociety. A code of laws, in uni&s;on with a good con&s;titution, form|ed upon the voice of the people, is &s;imilar to a fortre&s;s upon a rock: It rai&s;es rulers above enemies to order and good govern|ment; and gives them every advantage, to di&s;play dignity and terror; or clemency and favor, as the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, or ju&s;tice and rea&s;on may require.</P>
<P>THE protection of life, liberty and pro|perty, is the principal object of law and go|vernment.
<PB N="14" REF="024563_0013_0FC7BE28D95CB4D0">
Could the&s;e be pre&s;erved with|out government, there would be no need of laws. The&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are &s;o in&s;epara|bly connected, that one cannot be fully en|joyed without the re&s;t. When liberty is lo&s;t, life grows in&s;iped, and is not worth the wearing; for, in that ca&s;e, we have nothing we can call our own. A lu&s;t af|ter power and property, is natural to men in general, and a prevailing pa&s;&s;ion with bad men. It is therefore evident, that the&s;e important ble&s;&s;ings, are expo&s;ed to con&s;tant inva&s;ion by &s;uch characters; and laws are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for their pre|&s;ervation. The more ju&s;t and rea&s;onable laws are; the more &s;ecure, may we &s;up|po&s;e, the innocent and indu&s;trious citizen is, in the quiet and peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all his rights, and enjoyments. In this view, laws are no terror to a good man; they are his &s;afety, de&s;igned for his hap|pine&s;s as a man, and his pro&s;perity as a member of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE vicious and di&s;orderly <HI>only,</HI> are a|fraid of good laws. For as the in&s;tru|ments
<PB N="15" REF="024563_0014_0FC7BE2E88384F20">
of death, in the day of battle, are kept con&s;tantly pointed again&s;t the enemy; &s;o are good laws directed again&s;t evil doers, as enemies to the common good. They are made to lay &s;uch characters under pro|per re&s;traints, or to puni&s;h them, when the power of re&s;traint fails to prevent their criminalty. In this re&s;pect, the law is not made for the righteous; but for the law|le&s;s and di&s;obedient.</P>
<P>GOOD laws have, therefore, penalties an|nexed, &s;uited to the nature and aggravati|on of crimes. The able&s;t Legi&s;lators in apportioning puni&s;hments in law to offen|ces, mu&s;t be guided by rea&s;on, and the de|gree of injury which they carry, in their nature and con&s;equences, to &s;ociety. To puni&s;h with le&s;s &s;everity, than the nature of the offence requires, may be con&s;trued as an encouragement to offenders: To let the puni&s;hment exceed the nature of the crime, is to e&s;tabli&s;h iniquity by law: be|&s;ides to extend capital puni&s;hments beyond due bounds, fru&s;trates their de&s;ign, by de&s;troying their terror, in making them too
<PB N="16" REF="024563_0015_0FC7BE2F52C8EA08">
familiar to our minds: all extremes &s;hould be avoided.</P>
<P>YET no &s;y&s;tem of laws can be &s;o per|fect, as to leave no room for after amend|ments. Time and experience in the ap|plication of certain laws in &s;ociety, be&s;t di&s;cover their imperfection, or their worth. In &s;ome in&s;tances, acts formed by very wi&s;e legi&s;latures, have been found to have very different effects, from what were original|ly intended in their formation. Among &s;uch mu&s;t be numbered all laws of human authority, e&s;tabli&s;hing a preference of re|ligious tenets and denominations. This conduct, according to the hi&s;tory of pa&s;t ages, has ever been found, &s;o far from an|&s;wering the promotion of real religion and benevolence: that it has been, a fertile &s;ource of eccle&s;ia&s;tic oppre&s;&s;ion, and blood|&s;hed.&mdash;Such laws have a tendency to con|tract, and di&s;tort the mind, to de&s;troy be|nevolence in the heart, and preclude free|dom of enquiry from the human under|&s;tanding. God alone, is lord over the con|&s;cience, and good laws never, never a&s;&s;ume the reins of government over it.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="024563_0016_0FC7BE30D8407F00">
BUT ideas of religious liberty &s;hould ne|ver be carried &s;o far, as to drop religion al|together from government. To do this, is to drop the idea of the exi&s;tence of God. For, the immutable and eternal principles of rea&s;on concur with revelation, in de|claring, that God is an object of religious wor&s;hip. We cannot realize his exi&s;tence, without admitting his exi&s;tence as an object of wor&s;hip. To deny either, is to deny both, and at once de&s;troys the foun|dation of con&s;cience, and all moral obliga|tion with it. No oath could be admini&s;|tered in a &s;ociety of this complexion. A government of this character is a govern|ment for ab&s;olute athei&s;ts only. No man can plead liberty of con&s;cience, thus far, without pleading again&s;t the very exi&s;tence of con&s;cience at the &s;ame time; and &s;urely it mu&s;t be erroneous to argue for &s;uch a con&s;cience, as does not con&s;i&s;t with the exi&s;tence of a moral world.&mdash;But not to digre&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEN experience, which has di&s;covered the errors of &s;ome laws, has clearly evinc|ed
<PB N="18" REF="024563_0017_0FC7BE34F30E1180">
the unnece&s;&s;ary nature of others; it may be proper to expunge &s;uch, from the re|cords of legi&s;lation. To continue laws of le&s;s importance, than can be carried into execution by the ruler, with dignity and rea&s;on, is tempting &s;ubjects to treat law with contempt, and &s;peak evil of dignities. If they are continued, and not carried into execution; they may &s;ink into oblivion, in the minds of good men, and may &s;ome|times be improved, by vicious and de&s;ign|ing men, to injure the be&s;t of citizens. From the&s;e and the like ob&s;ervations, it appears very obvious, that the promotion of knowledge and literature, is a proper object of law and government. It has the greate&s;t influence, to cultivate morali|ty and virtue. Where the improve|ment of the human mind is overlooked, by tho&s;e who ought to promote it; the people &s;ink into ignorance and vice, and ripen fa&s;t for barbarity and bondage.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, in tho&s;e &s;tates where the means of knowledge are &s;upported by good laws, the people are enlightened: They
<PB N="19" REF="024563_0018_0FC7BE3725546580">
know the excellency of virtue, and the odi|ou&s;ne&s;s of vice: They love and practi&s;e the former: They hate and de&s;pi&s;e the latter, as highly injurious to &s;ociety&mdash;good laws are therefore e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;They are a defence to &s;ociety: are calcu|lated to promote the happine&s;s of man|kind: wear the &s;tamp of rea&s;on: are a|greeable to the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution; are founded upon the voice of the people. They encourage knowledge, virtue, indu&s;|try, and oeconomy: They di&s;courage ig|norance, vice, and indolence; and when properly admini&s;tered, are a terror to bad men. This naturally &s;ugge&s;ts in the</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>d.</HI> PLACE, that rulers are a terror to di&s;orderly per&s;ons, by the ju&s;tice and fidel|ity of their admini&s;trations. When the&s;e are wanting in rulers, the be&s;t laws on earth, may be wre&s;ted to injure and con|demn the innocent, and to exculpate and even reward the guilty. In &s;ome in&s;tan|ces, bad men fear not, &s;o much the right|eou&s;ne&s;s of the law, as they do the hone&s;|ty of the judge. Hence, the proverb, "A
<PB N="20" REF="024563_0019_0FC7BE3873DA8170">
man guilty of a crime, fears a judge, con|&s;cious of uprightne&s;s."</P>
<P>THE lo&s;s, ari&s;ing from remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in men of power, and from unfaithfulne&s;s in pub|lic officers, cannot be re&s;tored by the good|ne&s;s of the laws, nor by the excellency of a con&s;titution; but the deficiencies of laws, and imperfections in a form of govern|ment, may be greatly made up, by the faithfulne&s;s and ju&s;tice of rulers, in admi|ni&s;tration. To promote the intere&s;t of pi|ety is &s;till more in their power, when the con&s;titution and laws harmoni&s;e in their favor.</P>
<P>ENERGY, accompanied with ju&s;tice in go|vernment, is always plea&s;ing to good men: and the contrary affords &s;atisfaction to the ba&s;e&s;t part of &s;ociety. &iquest;To whom under <HI>God,</HI> the &s;upreme governor, &s;hall the vir|tuous part of the community look, for the exerci&s;e of both; but to their rulers? Want of energy in government, is anarchy, and want of ju&s;tice, oppre&s;&s;ion; but integrity pre&s;erves from both evils. Should the
<PB N="21" REF="024563_0020_0FC7BE3BE0F32288">
days come when the eyes of the judge can be blinded by a gift; or men in place be &s;wayed by prejudice and party &s;pirit; then may we &s;ee wickedne&s;s in the place of judg|ment; and in the place of righteou&s;ne&s;s, that iniquity is there.&mdash;"When laws are well made, they &s;hould be inflexibly ex|ecuted."</P>
<P>A GOOD degree of a di&s;intere&s;ted and pub|lic &s;pirit is an important idea, to con&s;titute a faithful and hone&s;t ruler. Man is not made for him&s;elf. The apo&s;tle, forbids looking to our own things on a narrow &s;cale, and enjoins, that we extend our views to the things of others. Of all men on earth, a ruler in a democratic government, is the lea&s;t made for him&s;elf: And with a lu&s;tre peculiar to his office, he &s;hines un|der the influence of a di&s;intere&s;ted concern, for the public good.</P>
<P>BUT I proceed to remark</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly.</HI> THAT penetration and abilities in judgment, are no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to make
<PB N="22" REF="024563_0021_0FC7BE3FD6311760">
rulers a terror to evil doers; than a faith|ful and hone&s;t heart. The word of God pronounces mi&s;ery upon the nation, who&s;e rulers are weak-minded. "Wo, unto thee, O land, when thy king is a child." i. e. When he is weak, and devoid of the abil|ities nece&s;&s;ary for the effectual di&s;charge of his office. Enemies to peace and order, are not always confined to the cla&s;s of in|ferior parts. Weakne&s;s does not always accompany wickedne&s;s; though we may re|ally wi&s;h it forever might. The latter is no infallible evidence of the former. We can ea&s;ily conceive of a very vicious mind, endowed with great &s;egacity, and force of under&s;tanding. Be&s;ides, the advantages of a good education, are not be&s;towed on friends to morality and virtue, to the exclu&s;ion of others: the&s;e favors are frequently flung away, on men of di&s;hone&s;t hearts, and make them able in eloquence, and con|&s;picuou&s;ly great in argument. Rulers have often to combat powerful opponents. Men of inferior abilities, however hone&s;t in heart, are not equal to confront with dignity, and to confound with clearne&s;s, the &s;ophi&s;|tical
<PB N="23" REF="024563_0022_0FC7BE414C81EF50">
arguments which may be advanced in favor of wickedne&s;s. Want of abilities in rulers, has an evident tendency to bring government into contempt; and a con|temptible government, is hardly ever &s;uc|ce&s;sful in doing good.</P>
<P>EVEN an offender is not &s;truck with much terror, when he knows, that a well formed harangue, &s;hall prevail, over the credulous and weak, though upright mind of his judge. Moreover, matters of a pub|lic nature, are &s;ometime &s;o complicated, that men of the be&s;t abilities, in connex|ion with undi&s;&s;embled faithfulne&s;s, find it difficult enough to concert mea&s;ures an|&s;werable to the be&s;t ends of good govern|ment.</P>
<P>IT was thought a &s;evere judgment upon the Jews, when they made public officers of the meane&s;t of the people; and there is no rea&s;on to con&s;ider it as any thing le&s;s upon any nation.</P>
<P>WHEN God is about to do any thing great, and good for a people; he rai&s;es up

good and great men to govern in their public councils; but, when he is about to puni&s;h a people for their crimes; or to di&s;|grace them for their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, he has nothing more to do, than to permit the reins of government, to fall into the hands of the weak or the wicked: and in either ca&s;e, the ruin of the nation is inevitable. We may further ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>thly.</HI> THAT rulers are a terror to di&s;|order and vice, when their characters are adorned with a virtuous life, and conver|&s;ation. The badges of &s;tate in a ruler, never appear to &s;uch advantage, as when united to the beauty of his virtues.</P>
<P>WE may fear his power in the former, but, can never revere and re&s;pect his per|&s;on, without the latter. Vice is the great di&s;turber of public happine&s;s: the devour|ing lion, that goeth about &s;eeking our de|&s;truction: and tho&s;e rulers alone, &s;upport the dignity of their character, and diffu&s;e happine&s;s among mankind, who oppo&s;e vice, and encourage virtue: who honor

God by keeping his commandments, and &s;ubject their power to the &s;overeign laws of morality and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE conduct of rulers has a great influ|ence on tho&s;e, they govern. We natural|ly incline to imitate men in higher &s;pheres of human life. When we have cho&s;en men to govern us, it pre&s;uppo&s;eth our high e&s;teem of, and expectations from them. We have conferred upon them the highe&s;t honors we had to be&s;tow. It is not more natural for children, to look up with re|&s;pect and honor to their parents, than it is for a virtuous people, under an energetic government, to honor and re&s;pect virtuous rulers.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;hould vice actuate the ruler in his private life; or ambition and avarice pre|vail in his public councils: he &s;ullies his honor&mdash;his reputation is lo&s;t&mdash;his u&s;eful|ne&s;s de&s;troyed; and the people left to be|wail their di&s;appointment, and to dete&s;t the object of their own election, as a terror to

good works; but none to the evil. When a &s;elfi&s;h and vicious &s;pirit &s;tamps the cha|racter of a ruler, the &s;elfi&s;h and vicious ap|proach him, with a familiarity peculiar to a &s;imilarity of di&s;po&s;ition, and they mutu|ally &s;trengthen each other in their wicked conduct. "The wicked walk on every &s;ide, when vile men are exalted." To the&s;e ob&s;ervations, permit me to add in the</P>
<P N="6">6<HI>th.</HI> PLACE, that a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of religion, and the fear of God in a ruler contribute much to the terror of bad men. This is the fountain in the heart from whence all genuine virtue in life flows. How ami|able is the ruler who&s;e goodne&s;s as a man we admire and love, more than we dread his power as a magi&s;trate! How plea&s;ing is that obedience, which flows from a unit|ed regard to the excellency of the citizen, and the dignity of his office! Under &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions, with what &s;olemn, melting, death in&s;piring eloquence, does king David pray for piety to his &s;on, and &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the kingdom of I&s;rael!

my &s;on, a perfect heart to keep thy commandments, thy te&s;timonies, and thy &s;tatutes." Nor is he le&s;s particular in his charge to Solomon him&s;elf. Thus we hear the venerable monarch, with all the pathos of parental affection, &s;oothing his dying pillow, in his la&s;t addre&s;s, to one of the wi&s;e&s;t of princes. "And thou, Solomon, my &s;on, know thou the God of thy fath|ers, and &s;erve him with a perfect heart, and willing mind, for the Lord &s;earcheth all hearts, and under&s;tandeth all the ima|ginations of the thoughts: If thou &s;eek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou for&s;ake him, he will ca&s;t thee off forever."</P>
<P>&iquest; What heart, that is not hard as adamant, can read the following de&s;cription of a pious ruler, and not feel the &s;en&s;ations of delight and joy? "The God of I&s;rael &s;aid, the rock of I&s;rael &s;pake to me; he that ruleth among men, mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God; and he &s;hall be as the light of the morning, when the &s;un ari&s;|eth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender gra&s;s &s;pringing out of the earth

with the advantages of chri&s;tianity them&s;elves, they dread as an unpardonable crime, the neglect of tran&s;mitting its ble&s;&s;|ed precepts, to &s;ucceeding generations. Be|ing pre&s;erved from ignorance and infideli|ty they fear the di&s;mal con&s;equences of &s;uf|fering the youth in a community, to grow up under the di&s;advantages, peculiar to nations, not favored with public in|&s;truction. You will pardon my zeal, ye civil <HI>Fathers</HI> of the State; if I &s;ay that the fear of God is a protecting, and nur&s;ing parent, for order and good government.&mdash;It unites the &s;everal parts of &s;ociety, by the &s;tronge&s;t ties of benevolence and love&mdash;it di&s;po&s;es all orders of men, to be faith|ful to their engagements abroad, hone&s;t and indu&s;trious at home&mdash;it &s;weetens the power of the ruler, and effectually &s;e|cures a con&s;cientious obedience from the ruled. From this mutual harmony, ari&s;e the &s;trength, beauty, honor, and &s;afety of a nation; and public happine&s;s is a promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;ing. "For righteou&s;ne&s;s ex|alteth a nation."</P>

ON the other hand, &iquest; What is it that ripens a nation for ruin? The &s;acred ora|cles concur with the experience of all ages in informing us, that "&s;in is a reproach to any people." The voice of the mo&s;t high is, "If ye be willing and obedient, ye &s;hall eat the good of the land; but if ye refu&s;e and rebel, ye &s;hall be de&s;troyed."</P>
<P>THE conduct of providence, to public communities in this world, is frequently <HI>very</HI> different, from that which he di&s;pen&s;es to individuals. A veil of darkne&s;s covers the face of providence, in di&s;pen&s;ing pro&s;|perity and adver&s;ity, to particular per&s;ons in this life. Sometimes a man of di&s;tingui&s;h|ed goodne&s;s, is oppre&s;&s;ed with afflictions and poverty; while another is triumphant in wickedne&s;s, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more than his heart can enjoy. There is, however, ano|ther life, in which all this apparent differ|ence, may be adju&s;ted. But, in a general way, national &s;ins are puni&s;hed with nati|onal calamities; and when vice becomes predominant among rulers; the infection

goes by an ea&s;y de&s;cent, to the lower ranks of the people, and tends to their de&s;tructi|on. A di&s;order, in the vitals of the com|munity is &s;oon di&s;covered in its remote&s;t members, and indicates the political &s;y&s;tem to be in a mournful decay. Once more, in the</P>
<P><HI>7th</HI> PLACE, the eminent nature of their office, affords rulers every nece&s;&s;ary advan|tage, to di&s;courage wicked and unrea&s;ona|ble men in the practice of immorality.

They are called gods, from the power with which they are cloathed by the people, from God, to make laws. They are awful, from their appoint|ment by providence, to &s;it in judgment, and deliberately doom to death at the bar of ju&s;tice.

puni&s;hment pre&s;cribed by law, where gov|ernment is in force and energy.

<P>MY friends and fellow citizens, &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a free government does us honor, let us never do di&s;honor to our&s;elves, by di&s;obeying its legal and con|&s;titutional commands. Let us never di&s;|cover an impatient di&s;po&s;ition under the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;traints of good government. The&s;e re&s;traints are our &s;afety. Re&s;i&s;t|ance to a government like ours tends to ruin. Neither let us be meanly jealous of men who&s;e political exi&s;tence is but temporary, and derived from the people. Let us guard our elections well, and &s;tig|matize with contempt, every mark of bri|bery and corruption. But when we have cho&s;en men to rule by a clear majority, let even the minority tru&s;t them with a man|ly

charity, and treat them with re&s;pect and honor.&mdash;This is their due.&mdash;It is much to the di&s;honor of a free community, to re&s;emble an ill bred family, by quarrelling among them&s;elves, or &s;peaking evil of dig|nities. We may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, our rulers have many motives to excite their faithful|ne&s;s; but few, very few to lead to the con|trary. Every principle of duty and inter|e&s;t con&s;pire to make them what they &s;hould be. It cannot be expected, but, that the characters of candidates for places of pow|er and tru&s;t, &s;hould undergo an in&s;pection by the public eye. If they are found fair, they have the better pro&s;pect for public honor, in new elections: but if not; can|didates know that they will, and know that they ought to be neglected, if not de|&s;pi&s;ed. In a republic, the maje&s;ty of the people is great, and their bar tremendous. If we know and exerci&s;e the power that belongs to us under God as the founda|tion of government, rulers can never be lo&s;t to us, unle&s;s they are lo&s;t to them|&s;elves. This leads</P>

2<HI>dly.</HI> To ob&s;erve, that as the promotion of knowledge and literature is an object of law with good rulers; &s;o it al&s;o ought to be an object of univer&s;al attention among the people.

<P>ON the other hand, her fall in which &s;he left her offspring the &s;laves of a race of tyrants is a&s;cribed unto the following vices. A &s;elfi&s;h mind takes place of a public &s;pirit.
