<HEAD>The Life and Confe&s;&s;ion of JOHNSON GREEN, Who is to be Executed this Day, Augu&s;t 17th, 1786, for the Atrocious Crime of BURGLARY; Together with his LAST and DYING WORDS.</HEAD>
<P>I <HI>JOHNSON GREEN,</HI> having brought my&s;elf to a &s;hameful and ignominious death, by my wicked conduct, and as I am a dying man I leave to the world the fol|lowing Hi&s;tory of my Birth, Education, and vicious Practices, hoping that all people will take warning by my evil example, and &s;hun vice and follow virtue.</P>
<P>I was born at Bridgwater, in the Country of Plymouth, in the Commonwealth of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, was twenty-nine years of age the &s;e|venth day of February la&s;t. My father was a negro, and a &s;ervant to the Hon. Timothy Ed|&s;on <ABBR>E&s;q;</ABBR> late of &s;aid Bridgwater, decea&s;ed. My mother was an Iri&s;h woman, named Sarah John&s;on, &s;he was a widow, and her maiden name was Green. I have been called Jo&s;eph-John&s;on Green. When I was five years of age my mother bound me as an Apprentice to Mr. Seth Howard of &s;aid Bridgwater, to be in&s;tructed in Agriculture. I was u&s;ed very tenderly, and in&s;tructed in the principles of the Christian Religion. Whil&s;t I was an ap|prentice my mother gave me much good ad|vice cautioned me again&s;t keeping company with tho&s;e that u&s;ed bad language and other vicious practices, She advi&s;ed me not to go to &s;ea nor into the army, foretold what has come to pa&s;s &s;ince the commencement of the late war, and &s;aid it would not come to pa&s;s in her day. She died about &s;ixteen years ago, and if I had followed her good advice I might have e&s;caped an ignominious death.</P>
<P>When I was eighteen years of age (contrary to my mother's advice) I inli&s;ted into the A|merican &s;ervice, and remained in the &s;ame for the duration of the war. I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve to the world, that my being addicted to drun|kenne&s;s, the keeping of bad company, and a corre&s;pondence that I have had with lewd wo|men, has been the cau&s;e of my being brought to this wretched &s;ituation.</P>
<P>In March, 1781, I was married at F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;town, to one Sarah Phillips, a mu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters">, who was brought up by Mr. Olney, of Providence. She has had two children &s;ince I was married to her, and I have treated her exceeding ill.</P>
<P>When I began to &s;teal I was about 12 years old, at which time I &s;tole four cakes of gin|gerbread and &s;ix bi&s;cuit, out of a hor&s;e cart, and afterwards I &s;tole &s;undry &s;mall articles, and was not detected.</P>
<P>When I was about fourteen, I &s;tole one do|zen of lemons and one cake of chocolate, was detected, and received reproof. Soon after I &s;tole &s;ome hens, and my conduct was &s;o bad that my ma&s;ter &s;old me to one of his cou&s;ins, who u&s;ed me well.</P>
<P>I continued the practice of &s;tealing, and ju&s;t before I went into the army I took my ma&s;ter's key, unlocked his che&s;t, and &s;tole two &s;hillings; he di&s;covered what I had done, gave me cor|rection, but not &s;o &s;everely as I de&s;erved.</P>
<P>Sometime after I was engaged in the Ame|rican &s;ervice, at a certain tavern in Sherburne, I &s;tole fifteen &s;hillings, one ca&s;e bottle of rum, one dozen of bi&s;cuit, and a pillow ca&s;e with &s;ome &s;ugar.</P>
<P>In April, 1731, I &s;tole at the Highlands, near We&s;t-Point, a pair of &s;ilver &s;hoe buckles, was d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters">cted, and received one hundred la&s;hes.</P>
<P>In October, the &s;ame year, when I was at We&s;t-Point and we were extremely pinched for the want of provi&s;ions, three of us broke open a &s;ettler's markee, &s;tole three chee&s;es, one &s;mall firkin of butter, and &s;ome chocolate. I only was detected, and puni&s;hed by receiving one hundred &s;tripes.</P>
<P>Sometime in the winter of 178<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">, at Ea&s;ton, I broke into a gri&s;t mill, belonging to Mr. Timothy Randall, and &s;tole about a bu&s;hel of corn, and at &s;undry times the &s;ame year I broke into a cellar belonging to Mr. Ebenezer How|ard, of the &s;ame place, and &s;tole &s;ome meat and tobacco; and I al&s;o broke into a cellar and a corn hou&s;e belonging to Mr. Abiel Kin&s;ley, of the &s;ame place, and &s;tole &s;ome meat and corn; and at ha&s;t-Bridgewater, the &s;ame year, I broke open a gri&s;t mill, and &s;tole near a bu&s;hel of meal; and at &s;ame time &s;tole three of four dozen herrings our of a corn hou&s;e. I al&s;o went to a corn hou&s;e belonging to Mr. Nathaniel Whitman, of Bridgwater, and &s;tole two chee&s;es out of it.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t I&s;t, 1784, I broke open a hou&s;e in Providence, and &s;tole goods to the value of forty dollars. Soon after I broke open a &s;hop near Patuxet Falls, &s;tole one pair of cards, two cod fi&s;h, and &s;undry other articles.</P>
<P>In 1784 I al&s;o committed the following crimes, viz. I broke into a cellar about a mile from Patuxet Bridge, &s;tole about thirty weight of &s;alt pork, one ca&s;e bottle, and &s;everal other articles. About the &s;ame time I &s;tole out of a wa&s;hing tub in Patuxet, a pair of trow&s;ers, three pair of &s;tocking, and a &s;hirt; and at Seaconk I &s;tole two &s;hirts and &s;ome &s;tockings through an open window. I &s;tole at a barn between Seaconk and Attleborough, a woollen blanket, and through an open window near the &s;ame place, I &s;tole two &s;heets, one gown, and one &s;hirt. At Mr. Amos Shepherd&s;on's in Attle|borough, I &s;tole out of wa&s;h-tub, one &s;hirt, two &s;hirts, one &s;hort gown, and one pair of &s;tockings.</P>
<P>At Norton, I broke into a cellar belonging to Col. George Leonard, and &s;tole a quarter of mutton. The &s;ame night I broke into another cellar near that place, and &s;tole between twen|ty and thirty weight of &s;alt pork.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, I broke onto tavern near the &s;ame place, and stole near two dollars in money, and one ca&s;e-bottle of rum.</P>
<P>Between Providence and Attleborough, I broke open two cellars, and &s;tole &s;ome meat.</P>
<P>I broke into a hou&s;e in John&s;on, and &s;tole betwixt twenty and thirty wt. of &s;alt pork and beef, and one broom.</P>
<P>Some of the things I &s;tole this year, I &s;old at the market in Providence.</P>
<P>April 23d. 1785. I was impri&s;oned at Nan|tucket, for &s;triking a truckman, and &s;ome o|ther per&s;ons, at a time when I was intoxicated with liquor: The next day I was relea&s;ed upon my paying a fine and the co&s;t of pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>I broke open a hou&s;e in Stoughton, &s;tole &s;ev|eral aprons, &s;ome handkerchiefs, and &s;ome o|ther apparel.</P>
<P>I &s;tole about two yards and an half of tow cloth from Col. David Lathrop, of Bridgewa|ter; and the &s;ame night I &s;tole a &s;hirt from a clothier, in the &s;ame town; and I al&s;o &s;tole one apron, one pocket-handkerchief, one pair of &s;tockings, and one &s;hift from Thomas Howard, of Ea&s;t-Bridgewater, upon the &s;ame night.</P>
<P>The next week I &s;tole a piece of tow-cloth, in Halifax, and at the &s;ame time I broke into a hou&s;e, and &s;tole about twenty pounds of &s;alt beef, and three pounds of wool.</P>
<P>October 15th, 1785, I broke open a &s;hop in Walpole, and &s;tole &s;even pair of &s;hoes.</P>
<P>Nov. 1785. I broke open a &s;tore in Natick, and &s;tole a quantity of goods from the owner, viz. Mr. Morris.</P>
<P>At Capt. Bent's tavern, in Stoughtonham, I went down chimney, by a rope, opened a window and fa&s;tened it up with my jack-knife; immediately after, a man came to the hou&s;e for a gallon of rum; he called to the landlord, and his daughter (as I took her to be) aro&s;e and waited upon him. She di&s;covered the open window, with the jack-knife, and &s;aid it did not belong to the hou&s;e; it was concluded that it belonged to &s;ome boys who were gone to a hu&s;king, and had called there that evening.&mdash;It was my de&s;ign to have made my e&s;cape out at the window, when I opened it, in ca&s;e I &s;hould be di&s;covered by any per&s;on in the hou&s;e: But when the man came up to the hou&s;e, I fearing I might be di&s;covered, drawed my&s;elf up chim|ney and &s;tood on the cro&s;s-bar until he was gone and all the people were a&s;leep; I then de&s;cended again, and &s;tole near three dollars out of the bar; then a&s;cended the chimney and e&s;caped without being di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The &s;ame month I hid a quantity of goods which I had &s;tole (part of them being the goods I had &s;tolen at Natick) in a barn, belonging to Mr. Nathaniel Fo&s;ter, in Middle|borough, and I engaged to come and work for the &s;aid Fo&s;ter It happened that I was taken upon &s;u&s;picion that I had &s;tolen a hor&s;e (which I had taken and rode about four miles) and committed to gaol in the county of Ply|mouth, but as no &s;ufficient evidence appeared, I was &s;et at liberty. In the mean time the &s;aid Fo&s;ter found the goods and adverti&s;ed them. I &s;ent my wife to him, &s;he owned and received the goods, and I e&s;caped undi&s;covered, by her telling him that I came to his hou&s;e in the even|ing preceding the day I had gromi&s;ed to work for him; that as it was late in the night, and the weather rainy, I did not choo&s;e to di&s;turb him and his family, by calling them up; that I was obliged to leave the goods and return home, and being taken up on the &s;u&s;picion a|fore&s;aid, I could not take care of the goods &amp;c.</P>
<P>April 1&s;t, 1786, I broke into a hou&s;e, in Medford, and &s;tole two pair of &s;tockings, one &s;carf, one gown, and one pair of buckles.</P>
<P>The &s;ame month I broke into the hou&s;e of one Mr. Blake, innholder, oppo&s;ite the bar|racks in Rutland, and &s;tole a bottle of bitters, and three or four dollars in money.</P>
<P>Soon after I broke into Mr. Chickery's hou&s;e, in Holden, and &s;tole about thirty dol|lars worth of clothing. The next day I lodg|ed in the woods, and at evening Mr. Chickery took me up after I had got into the high-way, &s;earched my pack, and found his things. On his attempting to &s;eize me, I ran off, and made my e&s;cape.&mdash;I left my pack, and the money I had &s;tolen from Mr. Blake.</P>
<P>Not long after, I went to Mr. Jotham Howe's in Shrew&s;bury, and opened a window, and &s;tole a blanket.</P>
<P>I then went to another hou&s;e, broke in, and &s;tole a fine apron out of a de&s;k. The &s;ame night I went to a barn belonging to Mr. Baldwin, in &s;aid Shrew&s;bury, and lodged in it the next day, and at evening I broke into his hou&s;e, and &s;tole about three &s;hillings and three pence in money, and about nine dollars worth of clothing, for which crime I am now under &s;entence of death.</P>
<P>The &s;ame night I broke open the hou&s;e of Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">or, In &s;aid Shrew&s;bury, and &s;tole i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> money and goods, to the value of near &s;ix dollars.</P>
<P>I al&s;o broke into the hou&s;e of Mr. Ro&s;s Wyman, of the &s;ame town, and upon the &s;ame night, and &s;tole from him near two dollars.</P>
<P>Moreover, I &s;tole a pair of thread &s;tockings at a hou&s;e ju&s;t beyond &s;aid Wyman's, and hid my&s;elf in the woods, where I lay all the next day, and at evening I &s;at off towards Bo&s;|ton, and was taken up by a guard that was placed by a bridge in the edge of Westborough. I was taken before General Ward, confe&s;e&s;ed the crimes alledged, was committed to gaol, and in April la&s;t, I received &s;entence of death, for the crime aforementioned.</P>
<P>Upon the evening of the fir&s;t day of June, I cleared my&s;elf of all my chains, and made an e&s;cape from the gaol; And notwith&s;tanding all the admonitions, coun&s;els and warnings that I had received from the good mini&s;ters and other pious per&s;ons who had vi&s;ited me under my confinement, I returned again to my vicious practices, "like the dog to his vomit, and the &s;ow that is wa&s;hed, to her wallowing in the mire;" for the very &s;ame evening I &s;tole a chee&s;e out of a pre&s;s in Holden: And the next Saturday I broke into the hou&s;e of Mr. James Caldwell, in Barre, and &s;tole near twen|ty five dollars worth of clothing.</P>
<P>I tarried in Barre about twelve days, and then &s;et off for Natick, and on the way I broke into a cellar, in Shrew&s;bury, and &s;tole &s;ome bread and chee&s;e&mdash;Whil&s;t I tarried in Barre, I lived in the woods all the time&mdash;when I had got to Natick, I &s;tole two pair of &s;tockings and two pocket handkerchiefs, that were hanging out near a hou&s;e.</P>
<P>From Natick I went to Sherburne, and broke open a &s;tore belonging to Mr. Samud Sanger, and &s;tole between four and five dozen of buttons.</P>
<P>From thence I went to Mr. John Sanger's hou&s;e, in the &s;ame town, broke it open, and &s;tole a ca&s;e bottle of rum, one bottle of cherry rum, &s;ix cakes of gigerbread, and as many bi&s;cuits: I &s;earched for money, but found none.</P>
<P>At another tavern in the &s;ame town, I took out a pane of gla&s;s, and opened the window, but I was di&s;covered by the landlord, made my e&s;cape, and went back to Natick, and tar|ried there two days.</P>
<P>From Natick I went to Sroughtonham, and at Capt. Bent's (the place were I went down the chimney) the cellar being open, I went through it, and in the bar-room I &s;tole fifteen &s;hillings in money, one ca&s;e bottle of rum, and one half dozen of bi&s;cuits.</P>
<P>Afterwards I went to Ea&s;ton, and on the way I broke open a hou&s;e, and &s;tole &s;ome chee&s;e, and two pair of &s;hoes, and two pair of shoe buckles. At Ea&s;ton I tarried two days, and then made my e&s;cape from two men who at|tempted to take me up on &s;u&s;picion that I had broken gaol. From thence I went to Attle|borough, and through a window I &s;tole two chee&s;es and at a tavern near the &s;ame place, I &s;tole &s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence, one ca&s;e bottle of rum, a &s;ailor's jacket, and one pair of &s;ilver knee buckles.</P>
<P>I then &s;at off for Providence, and by the way I opened a window, and &s;tole one cotton jacket, one jack-knife; and at another hou&s;e on the &s;ame way, I &s;tole through a window one fine apron, one pocket handkerchief, and one pillow ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I came to providence the 26th day of June, and not long after, I broke open a cellar, and &s;tole one bottle of beer, &s;ome &s;alt fi&s;h, and ten pounds of butter.</P>
<P>A few nights after, I went to Col. Mantons's in John&s;ton, and the cellar being open, I went into it, and &s;tole twenty pounds of butter, near as much &s;alt pork, one milk pail, one chee&s;e cloth, and one frock.</P>
<P>A few nights after, I went to Justice Belknap's in the &s;ame place, and broke into his cellar, and &s;tole about thirty pounds of &s;alt pork, one neat's tongue, one pair of nippers, one box of awls, and one bag.&mdash;It remarkably happen|ed on the 13th ultimo (the day that had been appointed for my execution) that I was com|mitted to gaol in Providence, on &s;u&s;picion of having &s;tolen the things la&s;t mentioned, and on the 18th ult. I was brought back and con|fined in this gaol again.&mdash;Many more thefts and other vicious, practices have I been guilty of, the particulars of which might tire the pa|tience of the reader.</P>
<P>Some of the things I have &s;tolen I have u&s;ed my&s;elf&mdash;&s;ome of them I have &s;old&mdash;&s;ome have been taken from me&mdash;&s;ome I have hid where I could not find them again&mdash;and others I have given to lewd women, who induced me to &s;teal for their maintenance. I have lived a hard life, by being obliged to keep in the woods; have &s;uffered much by hunger, nakedne&s;s, cold, and the fears of being detected and brought to ju&s;tice&mdash;have often been ac|cu&s;ed of &s;tealing when I was not guilty, and others have been accu&s;ed of crimes when I was the offender. I never murdered any per&s;on, nor robbed any body on the high|way. I have had great dealings with women, which to their and my &s;hame be it &s;poken, I often too ea&s;ily obtained my will of them. I hope they will repent, as I do, of &s;uch wicked and infamous conduct. I have had a corre&s;|pondence with many women, exclu&s;ive of my wife, among whom were &s;everal abandoned Whites, and a large number of Blacks; four of the whites were married women, three of the blacks have laid children to me be&s;ides my wife, who has been much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by my behaviour.</P>
<P>Thus have I given a hi&s;tory of my birth, education and atrocious conduct, and as the time is very high in which I mu&s;t &s;uffer an ig|nominious death, I earne&s;tly intreat that all people would take warning by my wicked example; that they would &s;hun the paths of de&s;truction by guarding again&s;t every tempt|ation; that they would &s;hun vice, follow vir|tue and become (through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the ALMIGHTY) victorious over the enemies of immortal felicity, who are exerting themselves to delude and lead nations to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>As I am &s;en&s;ible of the heinou&s;ne&s;s of my crimes, and am &s;orry for my wicked conduct, in violating the laws of the great Governour of the Univer&s;e, who&s;e Divine Maje&s;ty I have offended, I earnetly pray that he would for|give my &s;ins, blot out my multiplied trans|gre&s;&s;ions, and receive my immortal &s;pirit into the Paradi&s;e of never ending bli&s;s.</P>
<P>I a&s;k forgivene&s;s of my wife, and of all per|&s;ons whom I have injured. I return my &s;incere thanks to the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, and others, who have vi&s;ited me under my confine|ment, for their coun&s;els and admonitions, and for the good care they have taken of me: God reward them for their kindne&s;s, and con|duct us all through this trouble&s;ome world to the regions of immortal felicity in the kingdom of Heaven&mdash;AMEN.</P>

<L>LET all the people on the globe</L>
<L>Be on their guard, and &s;ee</L>
<L>That they do &s;hun the vicious road</L>
<L>That's trodden been by me.</L>
<L>If I had &s;hun'd the paths of vice;</L>
<L>Had minded to behave</L>
<L>According to the good advice</L>
<L>That my kind mother gave,</L>
<L>Unto my friends I might have been</L>
<L>A ble&s;&s;ing in my days,</L>
<L>And &s;hun'd the evils that I've &s;een</L>
<L>In my pernicious ways.</L>
<L>My wicked counduct has been &s;uch,</L>
<L>It's brought me to di&s;tre&s;s;</L>
<L>As often times I've &s;uffer'd much</L>
<L>By my own wickedne&s;s.</L>
<L>My lewdne&s;s, drunkenne&s;s, and theft</L>
<L>Has often times&mdash;(behold)</L>
<L>Caus'd me to wander, and be left</L>
<L>To &s;uffer with the cold.</L>
<L>Hid in the woods, in deep di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>My pinching wants were &s;uch,</L>
<L>With hunger, and with nakedne&s;s</L>
<L>I oft did &s;uffer much.</L>
<L>I've liv'd a thief; it's a hard life;</L>
<L>To drink was much inclin'd;</L>
<L>My conduct has di&s;tre&s;s'd my wife,</L>
<L>A wife both good and kind.</L>
<L>Though many friends which came to &s;ee</L>
<L>Me, in the&s;e latter times,</L>
<L>Did oft with candour, caution me</L>
<L>To leave my vicious crimes;</L>
<L>Yet when I had got out of gaol,</L>
<L>Their labour prov'd in vain;</L>
<L>For then, alas! I did not fail</L>
<L>To take to them again.</L>
<L>If I had not conducted &s;o;</L>
<L>Had minded to refrain;</L>
<L>Then I &s;hould not have had to go</L>
<L>Back to the gaol again.</L>
<L>Thus in the Devil's &s;ervice, I</L>
<L>Have &s;pent my youthful days,</L>
<L>And now, alas! I &s;oon mu&s;t die,</L>
<L>For the&s;e my wicked ways.</L>
<L>Repent, ye thieves, whil&s;t ye have breath,</L>
<L>Among&s;t you let be wrought</L>
<L>A reformation, le&s;t to death,</L>
<L>You, like my&s;elf, be brought.</L>
