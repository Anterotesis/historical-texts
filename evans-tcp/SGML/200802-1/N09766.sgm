<Q><BIBL>HEBREWS, Chap. 1. V. 1.2.</BIBL>
<P>God who at &s;undry Times, and in divers Manners, &s;pake in Time pa&s;t unto the Fathers by the Prophets, Hath in the&s;e la&s;t Days &s;poken unto us by his Son.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Words I have now read to you, &s;hew the Apo&s;tle, the Author of them, to be a com|plete Divine, as well as a perfect Ma&s;ter of Addre&s;s.</P>
<P>You all know, this Epi&s;tle out of which the Text is taken, was written to the Hebrews, who acknowledged, that God had revealed him&s;elf to that Nation, by Mo&s;es and the Prophets. But then many of them denied that God had &s;poken to them by his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t: In order to rectify this Error, the Apo&s;tle in the Beginning of the Epi&s;tle, a&s;&s;erts a Fact which was nece&s;&s;ary to be believed by all the Jewi&s;h Nation; as he was now ordered by God, to aboli&s;h all the Jewi&s;h Rites, which as yet had not been done by any Revelation from Heaven: and the Jews were bound to obey the Law given from Heaven, 'til &s;uch Time, as that Law was &s;et a&s;ide by the &s;ame Authority which gave it at fir&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Year 52&mdash; We find in Acts 15&mdash;that the Gentile Chri&s;|tians, were orderd to ab&s;tain from Meats offered to Idols, from Blood, from Things &s;trangled, and from Fornication. But it does not appear that the Jews were exempted from ob&s;erving the Law of Mo&s;es, till the Year 64&mdash;they were to ob&s;erve the Law of Mo&s;es, together with the Laws of Chri&s;t, till they received an Order from Heaven to &s;et a&s;ide the old Law. This was the Difference between the Jewi&s;h and Gentile Chri&s;tians, till this Epi&s;tle to the Hebrews was written.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the Epi&s;tle to the Hebrews the Apo&s;tle allows what the Jews contended for, that God had revealed him&s;elf, not only to the Jews, but to many, even before Mo&s;es.
<PB N="2" REF="012428_0005_0F89985078FF4348">
At <HI>Sundry Times</HI> God acquainted the World, that the Soul was immortal; by Enoch, by Noah, before the Flood: and Abraham <HI>taught his Children the Commandments of the Lord,</HI> after the Flood. And Jacob, <HI>by prophecying to his Sons of Things to come,</HI> &s;hewed that he had a Revelation from Heaven. Then, Mo&s;es taught the Children of I&s;|rael during their Pilgrimage through the wilderne&s;s. And after they came into the Holy Land, they were taught by Deborah, Samuel, and the other Prophets, in the Time of the Judges. By Nathan, in the Time of David and Solomon. And by I&s;aiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel; in the Time of the Kings. By Daniel, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi, in, and after the Captivity.</P>
<P>And the&s;e Revelations were made to them <HI>in divers Manners</HI>; that is, &s;ometimes in a Cloud, &s;ometimes in a Fire &s;ometimes in a &s;till &s;mall Voice; at other Times, by Vi&s;ions, Dreams, and a Voice from between the Cheru|bims: and by the holy Spirit &s;peaking in the Prophets.</P>
<P>As &s;ure as God had taught the people in the&s;e various Ways, and Methods, &s;o &s;ure it was, that the &s;ame God now taught them by his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who was the very Per&s;on, to whom all the former Di&s;pen&s;ations di|rectly pointed.</P>
<P>Before the Time of Mo&s;es, Mankind were taught by Tradition of what had been revealed, and by immediate Revelations. After Mo&s;es, they were taught partly by written Revelation, and partly by the Di&s;pen&s;ation they were under; and partly by Prophets and holy Per&s;ons, who were in&s;pired to teach them in tho&s;e Points in which, their written Revelation was deficient, or imperfect.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Will of Heaven, was exhibited in the&s;e Periods of the Church of God, in various Ways, and different Methods. But after Chri&s;t came, the whole Scheme of our Redemption by a crucified Saviour was re|vealed, and all committed to writing, by which, all Chri&s;|tians are to regulate their Faith and Practice. Now, all the <HI>Evidence</HI> for their Faith, and all the <HI>Rules</HI> for their
<PB N="3" REF="012428_0006_0F8998512F3FE6C8">
Conduct, are to be found in the &s;acred Volume. There fore we read, That <HI>Chri&s;t brought Life, and Immortality to Light through the Go&s;pel.</HI> (2 Epi&s;tle to Timothy 1.10) This Expre&s;&s;ion, is not to be under&s;tood as if the Doctrine of the immortality of the Soul, was not believed before Chri&s;t came; but only to intimate, that all the Evidences for it, were not contained in the written Rules given to the Jews. The Prophets were to teach the Jews in many Things not contained in the written Law, &s;aying, <HI>know the</HI> Lord in <HI>this,</HI> and <HI>other particulars</HI>; but under the Di&s;pen|&s;ation of the Me&s;iah, <HI>All &s;hall know him from the greate&s;t to the lea&s;t.</HI> That is, all the Evidences for Chri&s;tianity, for the Immortality of the Soul, and for our Conduct as Chri&s;tians, are contained in the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. There we may be fully acquainted, how we were re|deemed, that the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance is afforded to all who &s;eek for it, to help them to find out the Truth; and after they have found it, to enable them to practi&s;e all Go&s;pel Obedience, which will qualify the Soul to enjoy the Happine&s;s of Heaven: and that Chri&s;t will intercede in Right of his own Merits, that all who have believed in him, and acknowledged him as their Lord and Ma&s;ter, and obeyed his Laws, &s;hall be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Degree of Happine&s;s, of which, their Go&s;pel Obedi|ence has rendered them fit to be Partakers.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle, in the Text, takes it for granted, that God was the Author of &s;everal former Di&s;pen&s;ations; and I &s;hall do the &s;ame now,&mdash;and only exhibit the Proof that the Chri&s;tian Religion came from God, with all the Evi|dence, that the Importance of the Ca&s;e required.</P>
<P>Neither the Time allowed me, nor your Patience will admit that I &s;hould mention all the Evidences contained in the Scriptures, as a Proof, that the Chri&s;tian Religion came from God. Therefore, I &s;hall, at this Time, in&s;i&s;t upon only one &s;ingle Evidence, out of many,&mdash;that is, the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, as a full Proof in the Ca&s;e. If the Re&s;urrection is proved by inconte&s;table Evidence, then
<PB N="4" REF="012428_0007_0F899852D0ED2140">
the Chri&s;tian Religion mu&s;t have come from God: If that cannot be proved, all the Evidences mu&s;t be deem|ed in&s;ignificant. <HI>If Chri&s;t be not ri&s;en, then is our preaching vain, and your Faith is al&s;o vain,</HI> (1 Corinthians 15.14.</P>
<P>The Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t is a Matter of Fact,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Every rational Being is as good a Judge of a Matter of Fact, as the greate&s;t Man upon Earth.</NOTE> &s;aid to be done upwards of &s;eventeen Hundred Years ago: therefore the Evidence for this Fact mu&s;t be taken from the Hi&s;torians of that Age, in which, it is &s;aid Chri&s;t aro&s;e from the Dead.</P>
<P>Let only the &s;ame Credit be given to the Authors of the New Te&s;tament, that is allowed to other Hi&s;torians of that Age in which they lived, and the Matter is put out of all Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Friends and Enemies all agree that Chri&s;t was dead be|fore he was taken down from the Cro&s;s. Pilate did not con&s;ent that Chri&s;t &s;hould be taken from the Cro&s;s till he was &s;ure that he was dead: The Soldiers did not take him down from the Cro&s;s, till they had <HI>with a Spear pierced his Side, and forthwith came thereout Blood and wa|ter.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">There is no Water in that Part of the Body, but what is con|tained in the Pericardium; if that is broken it is in&s;tant Death.</NOTE> (John 19.34.)</P>
<P>Thus it appears that Chri&s;t was dead; let us &s;ee if there is any Evidence that he was alive after this. For the Evidence of this, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the Hi&s;to|rians of that Age.</P>
<P>The eleven Apo&s;tles declare, that they &s;aw and con|ver&s;ed with Chri&s;t after he ro&s;e from the Dead, at &s;everal Times, within forty Days after he ro&s;e. Not only &s;o, but he appointed the Time when, and the Place where he would appear to them.</P>
<P>And 'tis al&s;o affirmed, that five Hundred Per&s;ons &s;aw him at one Time, after he ro&s;e from the Dead.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tles upon all Opportunities declare that they were Witne&s;&s;es of his re&s;urrection; and they affirmed this, at the Peril of their Lives.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="012428_0008_0F899853CF27CA90">If this was not true; the Conduct of the Apo&s;tles can|not be accounted for, upon any rational Footing. For there was no <HI>Advantage</HI> could ari&s;e to them in <HI>this</HI> World, but much <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Danger,</HI> for a&s;&s;erting what they did. And as to the other World, for they believed the Immortality of the Soul, they mu&s;t expect nothing but Puni&s;hment, if they per&s;i&s;ted in declaring that to be true, which they knew to be ab&s;olutely fal&s;e.</P>
<P>Let the Conduct of the Apo&s;tles be ever &s;o unaccount|able, in a&s;&s;erting that Chri&s;t was ri&s;en from the Dead; yet if there are other Hi&s;torians, of equal Character with them, who lived at the Time when it was &s;aid, that Chri&s;t ro&s;e from the Dead, and declare that he did not ri&s;e; and that they could produce Numbers be&s;ides them&s;elves, who &s;aw his Body livele&s;s and unanimated, lying in the Market at Jeru&s;alem, at various Times for forty Days; and not only &s;o, but five Hundred People &s;aw it there, in this lifele&s;s State, at one Time; and that the greate&s;t Part of the&s;e People were alive when the&s;e Hi&s;torians a&s;&s;erted the&s;e Facts, and that they died for a&s;&s;erting of them: Were this the Ca&s;e, it would greatly weaken the Apo&s;tles' Evi|dence in the Matter of the Re&s;urrection. That is, if we con&s;ider the Apo&s;tles' Evidence as only human, as I do for the pre&s;ent, this contrary Evidence would go near to de|&s;troy what had been affirmed by the Apo&s;tles.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is allowed that the <HI>onus probandi,</HI> lies on the affirmative Side of the Que&s;tion: Yet it is but ju&s;t to call for Evidence hereof from the other Side; as it was in the Power of tho&s;e who denied the Re&s;ur|rection, to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a po&s;itive Proof, by producing the Body of Chri&s;t if he was not ri&s;en.</NOTE> But is this the Ca&s;e? Is there &s;o much as one Hi&s;torian, who a&s;&s;erts that he &s;aw the Body of Chri&s;t dead, after the Apo&s;|tles declare it to be alive? Were not the Jews and Ro|mans as much concerned to prove the Fal&s;ehood of the Apo&s;tles in this point, as they were to &s;upport their own Characters? Were they not warned beforehand, that Chri&s;t had &s;aid he &s;hould ri&s;e the third Day? Did they
<PB N="6" REF="012428_0009_0F899854313E1FF8">
not upon this Information take the Charge of the Body of Chri&s;t, after it was laid in the Tomb,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the Tomb was cut out of a &s;olid Rock, there was but one Way for the Body to come out; &s;o it was ea&s;y to guard it and pre|vent any Cheat in the Ca&s;e.</NOTE> in order, to prevent any publick Deception? If the Body was gone, were not they who took the Charge of it, an&s;werable for it to the Publick?</P>
<P>All Power, civil and military, was in the Hands of the Jews and Romans, at that Time. They could ea&s;ily have confuted the Apo&s;tles, if what they a&s;&s;erted was not true. The Magi&s;trates could have &s;earched and ran&s;acked every Corner in the whole City.</P>
<P>But there was no Need of &s;o great a Search as this; for if his Body was left in the Hands of any, except Chri&s;ti|ans, they would readily deliver it up, in order to expo&s;e the Cheat. Accordingly if the Body was in Jeru&s;alem in a lifele&s;s State, it might ea&s;ily have been found, and no doubt would have been found, and laid in open View to all the Inhabitants of the whole City.</P>
<P>If this had been done, it might have put an End, to all the Apo&s;tles had to offer in the Ca&s;e. Men would have &s;een with their own Eyes, that the Fact which the Apo&s;|tles a&s;&s;erted, was all at the very be&s;t, but a mere Delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Was this done? Or was it even attempted to be done? No! And what Rea&s;on can be given why they did not attempt it? Only this&mdash;that they were con&s;cious Chri&s;t was ri&s;en, and they could not produce his Body to the People. Otherwi&s;e they would certainly have taken this Method, and &s;tifled the Error, if it was an Error, even in its very Birth</P>
<P>If they had &s;earched for the Body and found it, this would have had the Effect, to have entirely e&s;ta|bli&s;hed the Prudence and Sagacity of the Enemies of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and confounded all tho&s;e who pre|tended to believe it.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="012428_0010_0F899854EFCBCF30">But this they could not do: his Body was not to be found by them. It could not be detained even by Death, nor all the Powers of Darkne&s;s, for <HI>it was not po&s;&s;ible it could be holden by them.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps it may be a&s;ked by &s;ome, why Chri&s;t did not appear to the Unbelievers; and convince them, that he was ri&s;en from the Dead;</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, that he did appear to &s;ome; for it is not rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that all the five Hundred Per&s;ons to whom he appeared were Believers, before he ap|peared to them. And we are ab&s;olutely certain that St. Paul was an Unbeliever till after Chri&s;t appeared unto him.</P>
<P>Indeed none of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> believed the Article of the Re&s;urrection, as one of the Characters of the Me&s;&s;iah, till after he appeared to them. When the Women told them that Chri&s;t was ri&s;en, <HI>it &s;eemed to them as idle Tales,</HI> and <HI>they believed them not.</HI> When the two Di&s;ciples told them that he was ri&s;en, and they had &s;een him, the Apo&s;|tles <HI>believed it not.</HI> Thomas ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to believe the Apo&s;tles, in this Point, till he &s;hould be convinced by his own Sen&s;es.</P>
<P>Indeed it appears, that not one of his Di&s;ciples believed that he was to ri&s;e from the Dead, till after he appeared to them. But then, they immediately became Witne&s;&s;es to the World, that he was ri&s;en from the Dead. Tho&s;e that were <HI>be&s;t</HI> acquainted with his Per&s;on before he &s;uf|fered, were the <HI>fitte&s;t</HI> Per&s;ons for Witne&s;&s;es of his Re&s;ur|rection: and no others were qualified to be Witne&s;&s;es in the Ca&s;e. For if they did not know him <HI>before he died,</HI> how could they know him <HI>after he was ri&s;en</HI>? Accord|ingly, his Di&s;ciples were the be&s;t qualified to be Judges in the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides all this: God is the proper Judge of his own Di&s;pen&s;ations, and be&s;t knows what Evidence, is mo&s;t likely to prove effectual to produce a Belief in Mankind: and therefore hath given that Evidence in Scripture, which
<PB N="8" REF="012428_0011_0F899855B1026300">
is mo&s;t powerful to bring us to a Belief of the Truth.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked, why there is not &s;ome Miracle wrought in every Age, and Country to convince People of the Truth of Chri&s;tianity?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, the very Thing de&s;ired, God has been plea&s;ed to do. Perhaps, there is not a Government upon Earth, where there is not a Jew to te&s;tify the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion. Every Jew we behold is a Miracle; for nothing le&s;s than the Divine Interpo&s;ition in a mira|culous Way, could have pre&s;erved that Nation di&s;tinct, when they lived amid&s;t all other Nations; dete&s;ted and per&s;ecuted by them for &s;eventeen Hundred Years.</P>
<P>Where are the ancient Romans now? Can any Man point out the De&s;cendants of that once numerous and po|tent People? And yet that Nation was in the Meridian of its Glory, at the Time, when the Jews were di&s;per&s;ed among all Nations. But to return,</P>
<P>The Evidence of the Re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, which proves that God hath &s;poken to us by his Son, or given a new Di&s;pen&s;ation under the Government of the Me&s;&s;iah, is &s;o clear and evident, that we mu&s;t renounce the very Faculty of Credibility, and all Faith in Hi&s;tory, before we can &s;et a&s;ide the Evidence which God hath given for the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
<P>All the Evidence is on the Side of Chri&s;tianity, there is none on the other. Though the Enemies to Chri&s;tianity have ran&s;acked all the Records of Time, they cannot pro|duce &s;o much as one Man, that has &s;aid he &s;aw the Body of Chri&s;t confined under the Power of Death, after the Apo&s;tles declare he was ri&s;en from the Dead. Is it po&s;&s;i|ble then, that Men who make Evidence the Standard of their Belief, &s;hould he&s;itate a Moment about the Truth of Chri&s;tianity? There is &s;ufficient Evidence offered in the Scripture, for the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion, to <HI>&s;ati&s;fy</HI> a rational Enquiry, whatever it may be to <HI>&s;ilence</HI> a u&s;ele&s;s Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>The true State of the Ca&s;e lies thus: The eleven
<PB N="9" REF="012428_0012_0F89985670BCF590">
Apo&s;tles declare at the Hazard of their Lives, and died for a&s;&s;erting of it, that Chri&s;t ro&s;e from the Dead. They declare that they <HI>&s;aw</HI> him, <HI>handled</HI> him, and <HI>eat</HI> with him, after he <HI>died,</HI> and <HI>ro&s;e from the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>On the other Side, there is not the lea&s;t di&s;tant Hint given by any Hi&s;torian, even of the lowe&s;t Character, that any Per&s;on &s;aw the Body of Chri&s;t dead, after the Time, that the Apo&s;tles declare that he was ri&s;en.</P>
<P>Now which Man acts the mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with the Cha|racter of a rational Being,&mdash; he who believes eleven Men, who a&s;&s;ert a Matter of Fact, that they were Ear and Eye Witne&s;&s;es of; or he who refu&s;es his Belief? And yet there is not one Per&s;on who a&s;&s;erts the Contrary to be true, that is, not one Per&s;on who though he had it in his <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> to detect the Error, were it an Error, that ever has &s;aid the lea&s;t Thing that could invalidate the Evidence, the Apo&s;tles have laid before the World.</P>
<P>If Men will be determined by plain Evidence in the Ca&s;e, they mu&s;t embrace Chri&s;tianity; for it is true, that Chri&s;t ro&s;e from the Dead; it is al&s;o true, that he has given us a Religion which we <HI>ought</HI> and are <HI>bound</HI> to be|lieve and practi&s;e.</P>
<P>I have laid the Evidence before you, to prove that Chri&s;t ro&s;e from the Dead; and till &s;uch Time, as that a Number of Hi&s;torians, of equal Character with the Apo&s;tles, can be produced, that &s;aw his Body dead, after the Time the Apo&s;tles declare it to be alive; the Evidence in favour of Chri&s;tianity is &s;o clear, that no Man who makes Evidence the Ba&s;is of his Conduct, can po&s;&s;ibly withhold his A&s;&s;ent to the Truth of our mo&s;t holy Reli|gion.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e there is not one pre&s;ent, that is willing to be governed by any Thing that is unrea&s;onable; that is to &s;ay, if &s;ufficient Evidence is laid before you, you will give your A&s;&s;ent accordingly.</P>
<P>In the Ca&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, you &s;ee, that the Evidence is clear, and ea&s;y to be found. And con&s;equently, that

our Belief is rational and and manly; founded upon &s;uch Motives as we are able to ju&s;tify, before God and Man.</P>
<P>The next Thing, after we believe the Record which God has given of his Son, is &s;incerely to take the Profe&s;|&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity upon us, according as Chri&s;t has com|manded; then to regulate our Lives by that Law, which our Saviour who ro&s;e from the Dead, hath given for a Rule for his Church in every changing Scene in this in|con&s;tant World.</P>
<P>In order, that we may make a right U&s;e of the Advan|tages we enjoy by a Go&s;pel Revelation; let us &s;et an high Value on the holy Scriptures, and make them the <HI>&s;ole Rule</HI> of our <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Practice.</HI> They contain the whole Evidence of our Religion, and all that Chri&s;t <HI>has done, is doing,</HI> and <HI>will do for his Church,</HI> together with the whole that Chri&s;t requires us to do for our&s;elves, with that A&s;&s;i&s;tance he has purcha&s;ed for us, and be&s;tows upon all tho&s;e who &s;incerely &s;eek for it, in the Ways of his Appointment.</P>
<P>If we would form a ju&s;t Notion of Chri&s;tianity, free from all the Corruptions which were brought into it by de&s;igning Men, we mu&s;t make the Study of the Scriptures a Part of our Religion. It would have been very happy for the Chri&s;tian Church, if they had made the Scrip|tures all along the Rule of their Conduct. Then they would not have fallen into tho&s;e gro&s;s Corruptions in Doctrine, Wor&s;hip, and Di&s;cipline, which have cau&s;ed &s;uch unchri&s;tian Divi&s;ions in the Church, which have cre|ated much Coldne&s;s in Religion. However, the&s;e Errors cannot be charged to our Religion, as contained in the Bible; if we for&s;ake the Scriptures for a mere Whim of Men's di&s;tempered Brains, we mu&s;t expect to embrace Ab|&s;urdity. But if we take the Evidence for Chri&s;tianity from the Scripture, we are always &s;afe; for our Faith then will not be changed according to the Fa&s;hions of the Times, but be placed and <HI>built upon the Foundation of the Apo&s;tles and Prophets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf being the chief Corner Stone.</HI> (Ephe&s;ians 2, 20.)</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="012428_0014_0F899857EFA7A948">Chri&s;tians who adhere to a written Revelation, have this Advantage, that by impartially con&s;ulting it, the Deviations from it may be detected, and their Religion be brought back to its original Standard.</P>
<P>Are we in doubt concerning the Truth of Chri&s;tianity? The Scriptures contain that Evidence in Favour of it, which is convincing to every Man&punc; who is determined by the Force of Evidence.</P>
<P>Are we in doubt about any Doctrine? The Scriptures are clear, as to all Points of Doctrine that were de&s;igned for this Period of the Church.</P>
<P>Are we at a Lo&s;s what was the antient Di&s;cipline of the Church? The Scriptures will inform us exactly, how the Apo&s;tles governed the Church in their Time; toge|ther with the Laws how the Church is to be governed to the Con&s;ummation of all Things.</P>
<P>Are we under deep Concern to find out what is our Du|ty? Open your Bible; there you may find it, in legible Characters.</P>
<P>Are we &s;en&s;ible we are Sinners, and have thereby lo&s;t all Intercour&s;e with the pure and holy Father of the Uni|ver&s;e? The Scriptures acquaint us, <HI>That we have an Advocate with the Father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Righteous; and he is the Propitiation for our Sins.</HI> (1 John 2.1, 2.) That though we are Sinners, yet we may obtain Pardon and Mercy upon the Go&s;pel Offer; that our Religion is a Re|ligion of <HI>Mercy,</HI> not of <HI>Merit</HI> in us: and accordingly we may be accepted through the Merits of Chri&s;t, if we re|pent.</P>
<P>Are we under Trouble and Affliction of any Kind? The Scriptures are a &s;overeign Remedy to allay our Grief; for they acquaint us, that God puts under, his everla&s;ting Arms, to &s;upport the Feeble, and holds out his Mercy to encourage the de&s;ponding Soul, and alleviate the Grief of the Mourner.</P>
<P>Are we groaning under a Load of Infamy, becau&s;e our Characters are unju&s;tly taken from us? The Scriptures
<PB N="12" REF="012428_0015_0F899858AF30F690">
inform us, that it will not be long to the Time, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;hall appear before the Tribunal of Heaven and Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> and then our Characters will appear in their true, ge|nuine Colours.</P>
<P>Are we labouring under any bodily Pain or Sickne&s;s? The Scriptures a&s;&s;ure us, that after a little Time, we &s;hall be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Re&s;urrection Body, in which, there will be no Pain or Sickne&s;s. For as Chri&s;t ro&s;e from the Dead, being the fir&s;t Fruits from the Dead, &s;o will he al&s;o <HI>rai&s;e us from the Dead.</HI> I &s;hall conclude this Di&s;cour&s;e by lay|ing open the human Heart in all its Windings, Di&s;gui&s;es, and Corruptions.</P>
<P>To accompli&s;h this De&s;ign effectually, I mu&s;t make a &s;olemn Appeal to the Con&s;cience of each individual Soul here pre&s;ent, to &s;it as Judge in this Affair. The Rule, by which, you are to judge, <HI>is the Word of the ever-living God.</HI> The Things you are to pa&s;s Judgment upon, are your own inward <HI>Characters, Principles, Springs of Action, and Conduct in Life.</HI> No human Creature be&s;ides your|&s;elf, can pa&s;s a ju&s;t Sentence in the Ca&s;e. And yet it is of infinite Concern to you that &s;uch a Judgment be formed. The habitual Tenor of your Life mu&s;t be carefully exa|mined: your Conduct mu&s;t be arraigned, interrogated, and tried by the &s;acred Rule of God's Word. In Con&s;e|quence of this, you will &s;tand condemned, or acquitted, not by him that now &s;peaks to you, but by one who is infi|nitely better qualified to judge in this Matter; even by a Sentence which you have pa&s;&s;ed upon your&s;elf, having the <HI>Word of God</HI> in <HI>one Hand,</HI> and a <HI>true Knowledge of your own Heart,</HI> in the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>Who is there, that believes future Rewards and Pu|ni&s;hments, can &s;tand by, as an unconcerned Spectator, when Things of &s;uch infinite Moment await him? Are you fit for Heaven, or are you not? Or have you never made any inquiry about it? If you have not, how is it po&s;&s;ible you can be ea&s;y one Moment? Do you not be|lieve there is a Day coming, how &s;oon you know not,

<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> before the Bar of God's Judgment &s;eat? In this Proce&s;s all the Angels of Hea|ven, and all the Men that ever were upon the Earth, will be pre&s;ent. I &s;hall &s;ee you all there; and may I &s;ee you at the Right Hand of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, &s;houting forth Prai&s;es for the Mercies of Redeeming Love. In that Day, we &s;hall <HI>all</HI> hear the Sentence pronounced upon us, which will put us in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of everla&s;ting Bli&s;s, or con&s;ign us over to eternal Woe.</P>
<P>At this Tribunal the Conduct of every Soul will be tried by the Word of God. They who have made the Scriptures the Rule of their Life, and thereby are quali|fied to enjoy the State of the Ble&s;&s;ed, will by the Merits of Chri&s;t, hear this enravi&s;hing Sentence pronounced upon them, <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you.</HI></P>
<P>And on the other Hand; they who would not have Chri&s;t to rule over them, but &s;et up Rules of their own in Oppo&s;ition to the Divine Law, &s;hall neverthele&s;s be judged by the &s;acred Scripture, and hear this awful, and tremendous Sentence pronounced upon them in terrible Accents, <HI>Depart from me ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI> How dreadful, how amazing will it be, to hear &s;uch a Sentence pa&s;&s;ed by that loving Saviour, that mo&s;t kind merciful Redeemer; who had &s;uch a mighty Love for Mankind, as to come into an ungrateful World, and &s;uffer, &s;weat, bleed, and die, to put Mankind <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> a Capacity of obtaining everla&s;t|ing Felicity!

<P>If we can be per&s;uaded to realize this la&s;t Tribunal, it would be the very be&s;t Expedient to &s;ilence all Objecti|ons to Religion; and excite Mankind to the faithful Di&s;|charge of every Duty.
