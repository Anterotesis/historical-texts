<BIBL>NEHEMIAH, vi. 8, 9.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Then I &s;ent unto him, &s;aying, There are no &s;uch things done as thou &s;aye&s;t, but thou feigne&s;t them out of thine own heart. For they all made us afraid, &s;aying, Their hands &s;hall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, &s;trengthen my hands.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NEHEMIAH, who&s;e name this book bears, and who was now advanced to the government of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> was a very religious and mo&s;t excellent man, and remarkably rai&s;ed up by God, and peculiarly qualified for that eminent &s;ta|tion. The temper and conduct of a di&s;intere&s;ted pa|triot, a true lover of his country, and of a wi&s;e, vigi|lant and upright ruler and magi&s;trate, appears con&s;pi|cuous in his example, and through all parts of his public admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>HE was &s;ent to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> out of his captivity by <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> the King, (to whom he had been cup-bearer) in the twentieth year of his reign. The office of cup-bearer was a place of great honor and advantage in the Per&s;ian court, becau&s;e of the privilege it gave him of being &s;o much in the King's pre&s;ence, and the oppor|tunity he had thereby of gaining his favor, for the obtaining any petition which he &s;hould make to him, and the promoting his own intere&s;t. The <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> here mentioned is but another name for <HI>Aha&s;uerus,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="014124_0003_0F930200370A31D8">
who married <HI>E&s;ther</HI> a Jewi&s;h captive, and made her his queen, after repudiating <HI>Va&s;hti.</HI> And probably it was by the favour of queen <HI>E&s;ther,</HI> as being of the &s;ame na|tion and people with her, that he obtained &s;o honoura|ble and advantageous a preferment in that court.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, neither the honor and advantage of the place, nor the long &s;ettlement of his family out of his country, could make him forget his love for it, or lay a&s;ide that zeal which he had for the religion of his forefathers who had formerly dwelt in it. For though he had been born and bred in a &s;trange land; yet he had a great love for <HI>Zion,</HI> and was heartily engaged to exert him&s;elf for the pro&s;perity of it, and was in all things a very religious ob&s;erver of the law of God. And therefore, when &s;ome came from <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and told him of the ill &s;tate of that city, how the wall of it was broken down, and the gates of it in the &s;ame de|moli&s;hed &s;tate as when burnt with fire by the <HI>Babyloni|ans;</HI> and that by rea&s;on hereof the remnant of the captivity that dwelt there lay open, not only to the incur&s;ions and in&s;ults of their enemies, but al&s;o to the reproach and contempt of their neighbours, as a weak and de&s;picable people; and that they were in both the&s;e re&s;pects in great affliction and grief of heart; the good man being &s;uitably moved with this repre&s;enta|tion, applied him&s;elf in fa&s;ting and prayer unto the Lord his God, and earne&s;tly made &s;upplication to him for I&s;rael his people, and for the place which he had cho&s;en for his wor&s;hip among them. And having thus implored the divine mercy again&s;t this evil, he re&s;olv|ed next to make his application to the King for the redre&s;&s;ing of it, tru&s;ting in God for the inclining of his heart thereto: and therefore when his turn came next to wait in his office, the King ob&s;erving his countenance to be &s;ad, which had not been &s;o before in his pre&s;ence, &s;ays to him, "<HI>Why is thy countenance &s;ad, &s;eeing thou art not &s;ick? this is nothing el&s;e but &s;orrow of heart." "Then</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="014124_0004_0F930200DF6BF200">
(&s;ays Nehemiah) <HI>I was &s;ore afraid, and &s;aid unto the King, Let the King live forever. Why &s;hould not my coun|tenance be &s;ad, when the city, the place of my fathers &s;epul|chres, lieth wa&s;te, and the gates thereof are con&s;umed with fire?</HI>" He took this opportunity to lay before him the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of his country; and owning this to be a cau&s;e of great grief and &s;adne&s;s to him, he prayed the King to &s;end him thither to remedy it: and by the favour of Queen <HI>E&s;ther</HI> (it &s;eems) he had his petition granted him; for it being particularly remarked in the &s;acred text, that the Queen was &s;itting by the King when <HI>Nehemiah</HI> obtained the grant, it &s;ufficiently inti|mates that her favour was a&s;&s;i&s;ting to him herein. And accordingly a royal decree was i&s;&s;ued out for rebuilding the walls and gates of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah</HI> was &s;ent thither with it, as governor of the province of <HI>Judea,</HI> to put it in execution. And for his greater honor and &s;ecurity, the King &s;ent a guard of hor&s;e, under the command of &s;ome of the captains of his army, to e&s;cort him to his government. And he wrote letters to all the governors on this &s;ide the river <HI>Euphrates,</HI> to further him in the work on which he was &s;ent; and al&s;o gave or|der to <HI>A&s;aph</HI> the keeper of his fore&s;ts in tho&s;e parts, to al|low him &s;o much timber out of them, as &s;hould be need|ed for the fini&s;hing of it. However, the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> the <HI>Moabites</HI> and the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> and other neighbouring nations round, did all they could to ob&s;truct his de&s;ign and defeat his enterpri&s;e. And to this they were ex|cited, not only by the antient and bitter enmity which tho&s;e people bore to the whole <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> nation, becau&s;e of the different manners and different religions they were of; but mo&s;t e&s;pecially at this time, becau&s;e of their lands and property: for during the time that the <HI>Jews</HI> were in captivity, the&s;e nations having &s;eized their lands and the intere&s;t they had left in the coun|try, would be forced to re&s;tore and refund them, upon the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment and pro&s;perity of the <HI>Jews</HI> there.
<PB N="6" REF="014124_0005_0F930201B9F21370">
For which rea&s;on they did all they could to oppo&s;e their re-&s;ettlement: hoping that if they could be kept low, or quite depre&s;&s;ed, they might retain the prey they were in danger of loo&s;ing, and regain any which they had already lo&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Nehemiah</HI> was not at all di&s;couraged hereat, but put his tru&s;t in heaven, and made his prayer to the God of his Salvation. And having on his arrival at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> made known to the people the commi&s;&s;ion with which he was &s;ent, he took a view of the ruins of the old walls, and immediately began to repair them. And the work was carried on with amazing rapidity and &s;ucce&s;s, notwith&s;tanding all manner of oppo&s;ition was made again&s;t him both from within, and from with|out. For from within &s;everal fal&s;e prophets and other treacherous per&s;ons, under the influence of a wicked heart, &s;et agoing by the force of bribery and corrupti|on, endeavoured to create him ob&s;tructions; and, from without, <HI>Sanballat,</HI> the <HI>Horonite, Tobiah</HI> the <HI>Ammorite, Ge&s;hem</HI> the <HI>Arabian,</HI> and others, gave him all the di&s;|turbance they were able, not only by underhand deal|ings and treacherous tricks and contrivances, but al&s;o by open force; &s;o that while part of the people labour|ed in carrying on the building, the other part &s;tood to their arms to defend them again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of &s;uch as had de&s;igns again&s;t them. And all had their arms at hand even while they worked, to be ready at a &s;ig|nal given, to draw together at any part where the ene|my &s;hould be di&s;covered coming upon them. And by this means, through the divine ble&s;&s;ing, they &s;ecur|ed them&s;elves again&s;t all the attempts and de&s;igns of their enemies, till the work was nearly brought to a conclu&s;ion, to their own great joy, and the extreme mortification of their adver&s;aries. Then <HI>Sanballat, Tobiah</HI> and <HI>Ge&s;hem,</HI> &s;ent to <HI>Nehemiah</HI> to come along with them into the field, (as it &s;eems under a pretence) that there they might enter into an alliance together, and
<PB N="7" REF="014124_0006_0F930202C8931950">
&s;wear inviolable friend&s;hip to each other: but <HI>Nehemiah</HI> perceived that this was only a &s;tratagem to &s;urprize him, and do him &s;ome violence. He therefore &s;ent word that he was engaged in a great work which re|quired his con&s;tant attendance, and which he could not intermit upon any account. They &s;ent him the &s;ame invitation four times over, and he as often returned the &s;ame an&s;wer. At la&s;t <HI>Sanballat</HI> wrote to him in terms of the following purport, <Q>There is a report &s;pread among the people, and <HI>Ga&s;hmu</HI> (which is the &s;ame with <HI>Ge&s;hem,</HI> only differently &s;pelt) confidently af|firms it, that you and the Jews intend a revolt&mdash;that your de&s;ign in rebuilding the walls of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> is to declare your&s;elf King of the <HI>Jews</HI>&mdash;that with this view have &s;uborned prophets to &s;ugge&s;t to the peo|ple that you ought to be the King of the whole coun|try. Now as all the&s;e things are to be repre&s;ented to the King, it will be convenient for you to give us a meeting, that we may confer together about them.</Q> But in&s;tead of going to them him&s;elf, he &s;ends this &s;hort and cutting an&s;wer to all his in&s;idious in&s;inuations and lying &s;landers, "<HI>There are no &s;uch things done as thou &s;aye&s;t, but thou feigne&s;t them out of thine own heart,</HI>" they are all of your own invention, and have nothing of truth in them. And while he repre|&s;ents their enemies as endeavouring to intimidate them, and plotting ob&s;tructions to the work, he piou&s;ly be|takes him&s;elf to God, in prayer, for per&s;evering and increa&s;ing fortitude;&mdash;while their enemies endeavour to weaken their hands from the work, he dutifully looks to God to &s;trengthen them. "<HI>For</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>they all made us afraid,</HI> (i. e. did all they could to intimidate us) <HI>&s;aying their hands &s;hall be weakened from the work that it be not done. Now, therefore, O God, &s;trengthen my hands.</HI></P>

<P>I. THAT wicked and intriguing men &s;ometimes make u&s;e of the fictions and fal&s;hoods of their own hearts to hinder the lawful and laudable enterprizes of a people, and ob&s;truct their pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>THE corrupt hearts of fallen mankind, when not re&s;trained or &s;anctified by the grace of God, are capable of being influenced to any mea&s;ures or means, however wicked and guilty, and how much &s;oever they finally tend to the real infamy and wretchedne&s;s of them&s;elves, or the hurt and injury of others. Pride is naturally a predominant &s;inful lu&s;t in them, and therefore pre|eminence and &s;uperiority a very ruling pa&s;&s;ion: and to gratify their guilty pride and ambition, they &s;tick at no mea&s;ures, lawful or unlawful in them&s;elves; but ru&s;h through, right or wrong, and make u&s;e of truth or fal&s;hood, ju&s;t as their vain minds imagine will make mo&s;t for their purpo&s;es. To the&s;e &s;inful lu&s;ts and pro|pen&s;ities are owing all the wars and fightings that have ever been known among mankind, and all the blood unju&s;tly &s;hed from the death of righteous <HI>Abel,</HI> to the la&s;t &s;ufferer, murdered by the hand of cruelty and vio|lence. To oppre&s;s others and exalt them&s;elves, to ac|compli&s;h the de&s;igns of <HI>de&s;potic</HI> &s;way, all their inventi|on is put to the &s;tretch, all their efforts u&s;ed to frame and execute plans and &s;chemes of deceit, plots of &s;lavi&s;h

&s;ubjection to their caprice; and all the arts of lying in|trigue, and force of lawle&s;s power are called to their aid, and every &s;cene of violence, rapine, and murder is acted over.</P>
<P>SANBALLAT the chief or governor of the <HI>Hittites</HI> or <HI>Samaritans</HI> was always a great enemy to the <HI>Jews.</HI> He was a native of <HI>Horon,</HI> or <HI>Horonius,</HI> a city beyond <HI>Jordon,</HI> in the country of the <HI>Moabites</HI> When <HI>Nehemiah</HI> fir&s;t came and began to build the walls of Jeru&s;alem, <HI>San|ballat, Tobiah,</HI> and <HI>Ge&s;hem</HI> made them&s;elves &s;port with him, and affected to treat the matter with ridicule and contempt, and &s;ent to him and the <HI>Jews</HI> who were with him to know upon what authority he undertook this enterprize, and whether this was not a revolt or rebellion again&s;t the King. But <HI>Nehemiah</HI> an&s;wered "<HI>it is the God of Heaven that a&s;&s;i&s;ts us, we are his &s;ervants, but ye have no portion, nor right nor memorial in Jeru&s;alem.</HI>" And &s;uch was their envy and malice, that notwith|&s;tanding all their pretended ridicule and &s;corn! The &s;acred hi&s;tory informs us "<HI>it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to &s;eek the welfare of the children of I&s;rael.</HI>" But as <HI>Nehemiah</HI> proceeded with vigor in his undertaking, and as <HI>Sanballat</HI> heard (&s;ays the &s;acred hi&s;torian) "<HI>that we builded the wall, he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the Jews. And he &s;pake before his brethren and the army of Smaria, and &s;aid, what do the&s;e feeble Jews? will they fortify them&s;elves? will they &s;acrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the &s;tones out of the heaps of the rubbi&s;h which are burned? Now Tobiah the Amonite was by him, and he &s;aid, even that which they build, if a fox go up, he &s;hall even break down their &s;tone wall.</HI>" But this method of &s;corn|ful treatment and reproach not an&s;wering the de&s;ign in di&s;couraging the <HI>Jews,</HI> and they proceeding with engagedne&s;s and per&s;everance in their undertaking, and having nearly compleated the work, "<HI>it came to pa&s;s that when Samballat and Tobiah, and the Arabians,
<PB N="10" REF="014124_0009_0F930204AC3C8620">
Ammonites, and the A&s;hdodites heard that the walls of Je|ru&s;alem were made up and that the breaches began to be &s;topped, then they were very wroth, and con&s;pired all of them together to come and to fight again&s;t Jeru&s;alem, and to hin|der it.</HI>" But their attempts to injure and oppre&s;s the people, and put an end to their enterprize, by open violence and force, proving abortive, they then recur to the mo&s;t wicked, deceitful, and malicious fictions and &s;tratagems, to accompli&s;h their de&s;igns.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place they endeavour to decoy <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> into their power, under feigned preten&s;ions of real con|cern and friend&s;hip for him; and for this end repeat their invitation to him four times, thinking to do him mi&s;chief; but he being apprized of their mi&s;chevious plot as often excu&s;ed him&s;elf from meeting them, on account of the greatne&s;s and importance of the work he was engaged in.</P>
<P>THEN <HI>Sanballat</HI> &s;ent his &s;ervant to him the fifth time with an open letter in his hand; the letter was &s;ent open, doubtle&s;s on purpo&s;e to let any &s;ee or hear it, di&s;cretionarily, whom it might probably influence into their evil mea&s;ures; or in order to unhinge and terrify the minds of the people, and, by tampering with them, weaken the hands of <HI>Nehemiah.</HI> The purport of the letter was that he and the people de&s;igned to rebel, and make <HI>him</HI> king; and that to pave the way for this, he had appointed prophets to preach of him&s;elf at <HI>Je|ru&s;alem,</HI> &s;aying, there is a king in <HI>Judah;</HI> and now &s;hall it be reported to the king according to the&s;e words. Come now therefore let us take council toge|ther! He intended, and no doubt expected that this letter, if it had no other effect, yet &s;hould bring on an interview between them, in which he might do him a mi&s;chief. The notice which <HI>Nehemiah</HI> took and the improvement he made of it we have in the text. "<HI>Then I &s;ent unto him, &s;aying, there are no &s;uch things done as thou &s;aye&s;t, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart
<PB N="11" REF="014124_0010_0F9302055B87B2F0">
For they all made us afraid, &s;aying, their hands &s;hall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. New there|fore, O God, &s;trengthen my hands.</HI>" He was next attack|ed by a certain fal&s;e prophet named <HI>Shemaiah,</HI> whom <HI>Sanballat</HI> and <HI>Tobiah</HI> had gained over to their intere&s;t and hired for the purpo&s;e, and who would have intimi|dated him, advi&s;ing him to &s;hut him&s;elf up in the tem|ple, to prevent any attempt upon his life; but <HI>Nehe|miah</HI> by his great prudence avoided falling into the &s;nare; and in his treatment of this in&s;idious fal&s;e pro|phet he di&s;covers the mo&s;t delicate &s;en&s;e of true honor, and gives the mo&s;t &s;ignal proof of true courage and bravery. Hear his own account of the matter. "<HI>Af|terward I came unto the hou&s;e of Shemaiah the &s;on of Delaiah, the &s;on of Mahetabell who was &s;hut up; and he &s;aid let us meet together in the hou&s;e of God, within the temple, and let us &s;hut the doors of the temple; for they will come to &s;lay thee; yea, in the night will they come to &s;lay thee. And I &s;aid &s;hould &s;uch a man as I flee? And who is there that be|ing as I am, would go into the temple to &s;ave his life? I will not go in. And lo I perceived that God had not &s;ent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy again&s;t me; for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. Therefore was he hired, that I &s;hould be afraid, and do &s;o and &s;in, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me. My</HI> GOD <HI>think thou of Tobiah and Sanballat according to the&s;e their works, and on the prophete&s;s Noadiah, and the re&s;t of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</HI></P>
<P>IT is very common, as in the account now read, for wicked and intriguing men, out of pure malice and fiction to charge tho&s;e crimes and faults upon others, which they them&s;elves only are guilty of. Thus the&s;e &s;ame men who had accu&s;ed <HI>Nehemiah</HI> of &s;uborning pro|phets to preach him up for a king, without foundation, had them&s;elves roundly bribed others to prophecy fal&s;e|ly again&s;t him and u&s;e all their influence to intimidate him and hinder the good work in which he was engag|ed.
<PB N="12" REF="014124_0011_0F9302061A8ADC60">
But the work was of <HI>God,</HI> and was therefore &s;oon completed notwith&s;tanding all their malicious oppo&s;i|tion. "<HI>And it came to pa&s;s</HI> (&s;ays the &s;acred hi&s;torian) <HI>that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us &s;aw the&s;e things they were much ca&s;t down in their own eyes! for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</HI>" And thus always &s;hall the ene|mies of God and his people &s;ooner or later find all their wicked and hurtful &s;chemes and efforts again&s;t them defeated to their own intire &s;hame and deba&s;e|ment.</P>
<P>ONE method of intriguing again&s;t and oppo&s;ing the rebuilding <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> under the admini&s;tration of <HI>Nehe|miah,</HI> and keeping the body of the <HI>Jews</HI> in a &s;tate of &s;lavi&s;h &s;ubjection and oppre&s;&s;ion is yet to be mentioned according to the account we have of it in the end of the chapter containing the text; and that is, <HI>abu&s;ive and injurious letter-writing.</HI> The &s;acred hi&s;torian men|tions it in the following words: "<HI>Moreover in tho&s;e days the nobles of Judah &s;ent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them. For there were many in Judah &s;worn unto him, becau&s;e he was the &s;on-in law of Sheckaniah the &s;on of Arah; and his &s;on Johanan had tak|en the daughter of Me&s;hullam the &s;on of Berekiah. Al&s;o they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah &s;ent letters to put me in fear.</HI>" This <HI>Tobiah</HI> was an <HI>Ammonite,</HI> and an inveterate enemy to the <HI>Jews;</HI> and was of great con&s;ideration in the law of the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> of which he was governor with <HI>Sanbal|lat.</HI> He married the daughter of <HI>Shechaniah</HI> one of the principal <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and by his own and his &s;on's marriage and family connections there, had a powerful party in <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> it&s;elf, which were oppo&s;ite to that of <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> and to the true intere&s;t of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> nation. But this prudent governor by his wi&s;|dom, moderation and per&s;everance, defeated all their machinations, though they carried on a mo&s;t crafty

The work the <HI>Jews</HI> were engaged in was a lawful and laudable work, for the religious and civil intere&s;t of their nation and country; and tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed them were guilty of great wick|edne&s;s; and though God's profe&s;&s;ing people of I&s;rael highly de&s;erved, on account of their own &s;ins, much more than they met with, as coming from the hand of a righteous God, yet they de&s;erved not &s;uch treatment from their fellowmen.

<P>AND thus there have been and &s;till are wicked and intriguing men in the world, that make u&s;e of the fictions and fal&s;hoods of their own hearts to hinder the lawful and laudable enterpri&s;es of a people, and ob|&s;truct their pro&s;perity.</P>

Oh! that we might be enabled &s;uitably to regard the opera|tion of his hand, and repent and reform, and learn the things of our peace before they are hid from our eyes. And while we endeavour to take the be&s;t human mea&s;ures to oppo&s;e the unju&s;tifiable and cruel de&s;igns of our enemies again&s;t us, let us be careful to maintain a con&s;tant caution again&s;t a &s;pirit of &s;elf-&s;ufficiency and &s;elf-confidence, and be guarded again&s;t tru&s;ting to an arm of fle&s;h: and let us be exhorted to have our prayer continually unto the God of our life, and the Author of all our &s;alvation. Let us for&s;ake every wicked and fal&s;e way, and fear and &s;erve HIM: and if we are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and governed by the true fear of the omnipo|tent Jehovah, we &s;hall have no rea&s;on to fear what a pretended <HI>omnipotent parliament,</HI> or any man or body of men can do again&s;t us. HE who&s;e throne is in the heavens, and who&s;e kingdom ruleth over all, hath in|finite wi&s;dom and power to extricate us out of all our difficulties, and if we wait upon him in a way of duty in due time we &s;hall &s;ee his &s;alvation. May the cries of his people throughout this whole <HI>continent,</HI> be &s;incere, fervent and per&s;evering&mdash;may we all deeply lament our national degeneracy and corruption, and our land-defiling abominations and &s;inful departures from the God of our fathers&mdash;may we &s;incerely repent of our per&s;onal &s;ins, and <HI>obtain the like precious faith of God's elect</HI>&mdash;may God Almighty change the hearts and mea|&s;ures of men which are inimical to the true intere&s;t of his people&mdash;Heaven interpo&s;e and &s;ave the nation from impending ruin!&mdash;and may we in this land be ever <HI>the &s;aved of the Lord;</HI> and may he enable us to plea&s;e
