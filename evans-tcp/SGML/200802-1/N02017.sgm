<P N="1">&sect; 1. THE <HI>Sacred Oracles,</HI> of our Ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR, ev'ry where charge us, to treat the Mini&s;ters of Religion with a becoming E&s;teem &amp; Vene|ration. The APOSTLE, <HI>be&s;eeches us to know them, that labour among us, and are over us, in the Lord, and admoni&s;h us, and e&s;teem them very highly for their Works &s;ake.</HI> Nor is this inculcated upon us, as a <HI>Duty</HI> only; but recommended to us, as our <HI>Intere&s;t.</HI> And the rever&s;e is, a &s;ure Method to bring the Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Truths,</HI> which they deliver, into Contempt and Ridicule; and bani&s;h all &s;eri|ous Religion out of the World. A fini&s;h'd <HI>Strata|gem of the Devil</HI>! To this purpo&s;e one of our very Reverend DIVINES well expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf! <Q>As a corrupt, ignorant &amp; vicious Clergy, is one of the darke&s;t &amp; mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive Infelicities, under which the Rulers of the darkne&s;s of this World, hold it putrifying, yea, the grand cau&s;e of all the <HI>Corruption,</HI> in which Mankind lye gene|rally langui&s;hing and peri&s;hing: And it is not for nothing, that when the <HI>Kingdom of our GOD</HI> comes on, this mu&s;t be one Introduction or Con|comitant of it; <HI>Thus &s;ays the Lord God, behold I am again&s;t the Shepherds, and I will cau&s;e them to cea&s;e from feeding the Flocks, for I will de|liver
<PB N="2" REF="002396_0003_0FDB39888E9980C8">my Flock from their mouth.</HI> So the Re|ver&s;e of this, is, a &s;et of <HI>Good Men</HI> in&s;pired with an holy <HI>Zeal</HI> to do good, who like <HI>Angels, flying thro' the mid&s;t of Heaven,</HI> Preach nothing but the <HI>Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel,</HI> with the true <HI>Spirit</HI> of it unto them <HI>who dwell upon the Earth</HI>: Cer|tainly &s;uch Men are the <HI>Stars</HI> whom GOD <HI>calls by their Names,</HI> they <HI>&s;hine as Lights</HI> in the World, in their benign Influences; the Ble&s;&s;ings of the People that enjoy them are wonderful! are wonderful!</Q></P>

GOD has indulged to this People a very <HI>Candid, Learned</HI> and <HI>Religious</HI> &s;et of Men, who in all things unbia&s;&s;edly con&s;ult the good of their re&s;pective Flocks; nor do they intermeddle with <HI>other Men's Affairs</HI> more than what is proper to their Function. 'Tis this endears them unto us, and makes us rejoyce in them; and offer our thanks to GOD for the <HI>Gifts</HI> and <HI>Graces</HI> that &s;hine &s;o vi&s;ibly in them. And we thought our <HI>Neighbours</HI> were all &s;en&s;ible of the <HI>invaluable Ble&s;|&s;ings of</HI> GOD to us, in this Regard: But to our A&s;toni&s;hment, we &s;ee <HI>&s;ome</HI> in this Place &s;o <HI>daring|ly Frofane,</HI> as to Libel and Lampoon <HI>the&s;e holy Servants</HI> of our Ble&s;&s;ed JESUS; and <HI>others</HI> &s;o fooli&s;hly fond of their <HI>Invectives,</HI> as to counte|nance and promote them; and this, among <HI>&s;ober</HI> Per&s;ons, and <HI>Members</HI> of our <HI>Churches.</HI></P>

OF late, there has been Publi&s;hed, (it may be &s;poken to our di&s;honour) &s;everal <HI>detracting</HI> and <HI>&s;candalous Pamphlets,</HI> tending to render the MINISTRY <HI>Vain</HI> and <HI>Ridiculous.</HI> In the&s;e, this <HI>Sacred Order of Men</HI> has been <HI>Strangely</HI> repre&s;ented, and <HI>horribly</HI> animaverted upon. Many things have been charged on them, of which they been in|tirely <HI>Innocent,</HI> and many things that <HI>it is their Glory they have &s;poke them,</HI> have been mo&s;t ma|liciou&s;ly perverted and equivocated. And now, who &s;hould the Authors of the&s;e be, but STRAN|GERS OF ABJECTS, which inhances their <HI>Folly,</HI> and makes their <HI>Impudence</HI> the more brazen and flagitious. Above all, we wonder at a <HI>Weekly Paper,</HI> which has been, and is now, Publi&s;hed, either <HI>de&s;ignedly,</HI> to affront our Mini&s;ters, and render them Odious; or el&s;e, it has hitherto, wretchedly deviated from it's <HI>ultimate Intent,</HI> and been notoriou&s;ly pro&s;tituted to that <HI>Helli&s;h Servi|tude.</HI> We know no <HI>Nation</HI> under the Sun, that has &s;o openly and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly in&s;ulted the MINIS|TERS of their GOD; and been &s;o &s;trenuous, in their Endeavours, to make them de&s;picable and dete&s;table to their <HI>People,</HI> as the <HI>Authors</HI> of this &s;candalous <HI>Libel.</HI></P>
<P N="4">&sect; 4. THAT the World may &s;ee this Repre&s;en|tation is ju&s;t, we will recite a few Pa&s;&s;ages (as a Specimen) from their Writings, pa&s;&s;ing over the many indirect and &s;candalous Glances at them. In the Writings of <HI>John Williams</HI> (Tobacconi&s;t)
<Q>The Mini&s;ters have generally revolted from the good old way, and have &s;et up a way that their Fathers know not of, neither entered it into their hearts, to allude unto <HI>Jr.</HI> 5.23. They are <HI>revolted

<P>In the Learned <HI>Taliacotius,</HI> <Q>The Infatuations in this Country &s;eem always to have proceeded from &s;ome of tho&s;e who call them&s;elves the Sons of <HI>Levi.</HI> They are repre&s;ented as Men of WICKED DESIRES &mdash; and <HI>impious, ignorant</HI> &amp; <HI>bra&s;en|faced. Prob Fides! Oh Impiety! Oh Bra&s;s! In the Reflections on the Town Meeting, Aug.</HI> 11. 1721. It is <HI>thought by three parts of this Town</HI> that its better they were a-foot with a good pair of Shoes on their Feet, and a Staff in their hands.&mdash; In|cendiaries of Strife &amp; Divi&s;ion.

<P N="5">&sect; 5. THESE <HI>Reflections</HI> upon and <HI>Abu&s;es</HI> of this <HI>Sacred Order of Men,</HI> are &s;ufficient, to make the mo&s;t profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Libertine</HI> blu&s;h. Who is there that can &s;ee all this, the MINISTERS, by whom they expect to be brought home to CHRIST, thus auda|ciou&s;ly in&s;ulted, thus vilely trampled upon, and impiou&s;ly buffoon'd, by the profane Sons of <HI>Corah,</HI> and tamely &amp; &s;ilently bear it. 'Tis this amazes, &amp; alarms us, and we think it a <HI>Duty</HI> indi&s;pen&s;ibly
<PB N="5" REF="002396_0006_0FDB398D00312608">incumbent upon us, more thoroughly to <HI>enquire into the Characters of our</HI> MINISTERS, whether they are worthy of the&s;e <HI>Barbarous Reflections,</HI> yea or no? We cannot an&s;wer the neglect of this; if we &s;hould, our <HI>Con&s;ciences</HI> would one Day, as a <HI>Flaming Witne&s;s</HI> flu&s;h our <HI>Guilt</HI> in our Faces. We are their <HI>People,</HI> and hope by their precious <HI>Mini|&s;try</HI> to be brought home to GOD, &amp; Everla&s;ting Life; and therefore we are bound to appear in their <HI>Ju&s;t Vindication</HI>; and re&s;cue our Children, and our Neighbours from the deadly <HI>Poi&s;on,</HI> which the&s;e <HI>Children</HI> of the Old <HI>Serpent</HI> would infu&s;e into them. And here fir&s;t, We cannot but admire the Moderation, and con&s;ummate Patience of our PASTORS, amid&s;t the&s;e outragious and provoking Abu&s;es &amp; Scandals. They &s;hine with an <HI>Un&s;haken Con&s;tancy,</HI> and &s;till go on to <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> in tho&s;e very parts of their <HI>Office,</HI> that ten Thou&s;and difficulties have con&s;pired to ob&s;truct them in. Their Di&s;|charge of their <HI>Publick Mini&s;try</HI> is too well known, to need a Report of ours, and their <HI>Prayers</HI> &amp; <HI>Ser|mons</HI> proclaim them, to be <HI>Workmen</HI> that need not be a&s;hamed. Their <HI>Printed Labours</HI> are incon|te&s;table Te&s;timonies of their <HI>Abilities</HI>; and &s;peak an <HI>excellent Spirit</HI> breathing in them. Their nine <HI>Lectures</HI> upon <HI>Early Piety,</HI> Preached in &s;o remarka|ble a Time, that it plainly &s;hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, GOD was with them: The&s;e (if nothing el&s;e) recommend them to the <HI>Love</HI> &amp; <HI>E&s;teem</HI> of all <HI>good People</HI>; and we do not wonder to &s;ee the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;o earne&s;t in his <HI>revenges</HI> upon them. Their <HI>Pa&s;toral Vi&s;its</HI> are wi&s;ely, painfully &amp; faithfully manag'd; and if we enquire into their more <HI>private Conver&s;ation,</HI> we find them <HI>&s;hining In&s;tances,</HI> of the mo&s;t <HI>refined

Ne|ver are they addre&s;&s;ed by any in Affliction, but they admini&s;ter Comfort, and the <HI>Afflicted</HI> find the <HI>Bowels</HI> of a <HI>Father</HI> in them; and their <HI>Liberalities</HI> are al&s;o truly extraordinary. We never enjoy their <HI>Company,</HI> but their Savoury &amp; Entertaining <HI>Di&s;|cour&s;e</HI> evidently di&s;covers an Internal <HI>Source</HI> of <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> in them; and the <HI>Blame</HI> centers upon our&s;elves, if we grow not <HI>better</HI> &amp; <HI>wi&s;er</HI> by it. Some of them have <HI>great names</HI> in di&s;tant Lands; and <HI>foreign Countries</HI> have a great <HI>Vene|ration</HI> for them.

<P N="6">&sect; 6. BUT now, what is there can ju&s;tify the <HI>virulent</HI> and <HI>unwearied</HI> Endeavours of the&s;e <HI>Wicked Men</HI> to make them Odious? The only <HI>pre|text</HI> they have is, That the MINISTERS have in|termedled with <HI>Civil</HI> Affairs, and <HI>gone out of their Line</HI>; and the only In&s;tance they can give of this, (for the others are only groundle&s;s Surmi&s;es, or open Calumnies) is this, When the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> was fir&s;t breaking into the Town, and every one fore|&s;aw and feared a dreadful Mortality; the&s;e <HI>good Men</HI> were appri&s;ed of a &s;afe Method, which they by the ordinary Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, hoped might be an In&s;trument of &s;aving many <HI>Lives.</HI> This <HI>Me|thod</HI> came to them with very authentic Recom|mendations; nor was ever, any <HI>Remedy</HI> attended with a more uninterrupted, &amp; remarkable <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> than this. This they communicated to the PHY|SICIANS; urging them, (not to put it into practice, as the <HI>News-Letter</HI> declares, but) to <HI>meet together,</HI>

And to do &s;ome ju&s;tice by the way to that <HI>eminent Per&s;on,</HI> the <HI>Learned</HI> Dr. COTTON MATHER, <HI>Fellow of the Royal Society</HI> (who to his <HI>honour</HI>) was the principal <HI>In&s;trument,</HI> in promo|ving this <HI>Method</HI> among us: (and who now di&s;|dains to draw his <HI>generous Pen</HI> for his own <HI>Vindication,</HI> again&s;t the many fooli&s;h <HI>Pamphlets</HI> that are pointed at him; and who changes not his <HI>Temper</HI> for all their inviduous Calumnies;) we will here tran&s;cribe the <HI>Words</HI> with which he con|cludes his <HI>Addre&s;s</HI> to the <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI>; Dated, <HI>June</HI> 6. 1721. <Q>I will only &s;ay, (writes the DOCTOR) that ina&s;much as the Practice of &s;uf|fering and preventing the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> in the way of <HI>Inoculation</HI> has never yet, (as far as I have heard) been introduced into our <HI>Nation</HI>; where there are &s;o many that would give <HI>great Sums,</HI> to have their Lives in&s;ur'd, from the <HI>dangers</HI> of this dreadful <HI>Di&s;temper,</HI> nor has ever any one in all <HI>America</HI> ever yet, made the tryal of it (tho' we have &s;everal <HI>Africans</HI> among us, as I now find, who tryed it in their own <HI>Country</HI>) I cannot but move it be WARILY proceeded in. I dur&s;t not yet engage, that the <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> of the tryal here will be the &s;ame, as has hitherto been in the other <HI>Hemi&s;phere.</HI> But I am very confident, no per&s;on would mi&s;carry in it, but what mu&s;t mo&s;t certainly have mi&s;carried upon taking it the <HI>Common way.</HI> And I would humbly <HI>advi&s;e,</HI> that it be never made, but under the management, of a <HI>Skilful Phy&s;ician,</HI> who will wi&s;ely pre|pare
<PB N="8" REF="002396_0009_0FDB399484632370">the Body for it before he performs the O|peration. <HI>Gentleman,</HI> My <HI>reque&s;t</HI> is, that you would <HI>meet for a Con&s;ultation</HI> upon this Occa&s;ion, and to <HI>deliberate</HI> upon it, that whoever fir&s;t be|gins this practi&s;e, (<HI>if you approve that it &s;hould be begun at all</HI>) may have the concurrence of his <HI>worthy Brethren</HI> to fortify him in it &mdash;.</Q></P>
<P>Thus the Doctor.</P>
<P>WE appeal to the whole World, whether this <HI>Gentleman went out of his line,</HI> or did any thing, but what became a <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> or a <HI>Gen|tleman,</HI> in his addre&s;s. And this is all the blame, they do with any <HI>Colour</HI> charge upon him, &amp; which has given <HI>Life</HI> to &s;o many mon&s;trous, and bitter <HI>Invectives</HI> again&s;t him. But to return from this Excur&s;ion. The <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> never met, nor con&s;ulted about this <HI>Method,</HI> according to the <HI>de|&s;ires</HI> of the MINISTERS, till one of them began the Experiment upon his <HI>Family.</HI> He had ju&s;t rea&s;on to apprehend them in danger of being In|fected the <HI>Common way</HI>: and here, I cannot omit to ob&s;erve the <HI>happy juncture</HI> of <HI>Affairs</HI> that <HI>united,</HI> to render this his Attempt <HI>Innocent</HI> &amp; <HI>Blamele&s;s</HI> The worthy TOWNSMEN had taken the <HI>Guards</HI> off the <HI>Infected hou&s;es,</HI> and in effect proclaim'd the <HI>Infection</HI> &s;o prevalent, that 'twould be in vain, to &s;trive to &s;uppre&s;s it. By this <HI>act</HI> the <HI>Nur&s;es</HI> were commi&s;&s;ioned, to air them&s;elves, who had been &s;tifled, for a con&s;iderable Time, by a clo&s;e Confine|ment with the <HI>Sick: Liberty</HI> was declared to them to walk the Streets; and now as the <HI>nece&s;&s;ities</HI> of the <HI>Sick</HI> urged, the&s;e <HI>Infected per&s;ons</HI> might go to our <HI>Doctors</HI> upon any occa&s;ion; and any heedle&s;s or head-&s;trong <HI>Neighbours</HI> run in to vi&s;it their con|tagious

This clearly evinces the <HI>eminency</HI> of the <HI>danger</HI> his Family was in; and in a great mea&s;ure vindi|cates his procedure. But notwith&s;tanding, a <HI>mighty Storm</HI> was rai&s;ed, &amp; a &s;aucy <HI>Libel</HI> publi&s;hed, which among other things demanded an an&s;wer to a <HI>Ca&s;e of Con&s;cience.</HI> Six MINISTERS of BOSTON under|took to give a proper an&s;wer to the Demand, wherein they did &s;ome ju&s;tice to the <HI>Gentleman</HI> that <HI>that Paper</HI> had <HI>unju&s;tly</HI> reproached. After this, the MINISTERS were &s;ilent for &s;everal Months, till at length the con&s;tant <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> of the Experi|ment encouraged <HI>Some</HI> of them to publi&s;h their <HI>Sentiments</HI> on this &s;ubject, e&s;pecially what related <HI>to the ca&s;e of Con&s;cience.</HI> And here, we think it very &s;trange &amp; rediculous, to &s;ee the <HI>Satyri&s;ts</HI> play the Divine, and deny that it falls under the Cognizance of our MINISTERS, when &s;o many People pretend CONSCIENCE in the matter. This is to <HI>boa&s;t</HI> of their own Divinity, as if they were the only proper <HI>judges</HI> of what is the part of a <HI>Divine,</HI> and to <HI>Counterpoint</HI> their own <HI>Skill</HI> and <HI>Judgment</HI> to that of our famous <HI>Profe&s;&s;ors.</HI> But we will not ask who <HI>go out of their line now</HI>? This is a full Hi&s;tory of the <HI>crimes</HI> charged on the <HI>Mi|ni&s;ters,</HI> wherein they have <HI>gone out of their line</HI>: That is to &s;ay, When they &s;aw their <HI>People</HI> dying about them, and their deare&s;t <HI>Friends</HI> they had, <HI>Ga&s;ping for their Breath,</HI> they did not ca&s;t off all <HI>bowels</HI> of <HI>compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> and be <HI>content</HI> that no further tryal &s;hould be made of a <HI>Method,</HI> that they ap|prehended would deliver them from their <HI>danger.</HI></P>

WE will not on this occa&s;ion enquire, how far our <HI>Practitioners</HI> &amp; late <HI>Libellers</HI> have <HI>gone out of their line.</HI> But this we remark, that if any <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> of any Profe&s;&s;ion, had been appri|&s;ed of a <HI>&s;afe Method</HI> to pre&s;erve his <HI>Neighbour's</HI> Life, in a Time of common danger, and had not <HI>communicated</HI> it to him, he had approved him&s;elf to be of a very un-natural, and un-chri&s;tian <HI>Tem|per.</HI> And our MINISTERS e&s;pecially, who are <HI>Sluring Patterns</HI> of <HI>Charity,</HI> would have appear'd with a <HI>di&s;tingui&s;ht Blackne&s;s,</HI> had they neglected this good Office to the <HI>Flocks</HI> intru&s;ted with them. How very unju&s;t and wicked then are the <HI>Obloquies</HI> and <HI>Outrages</HI> which have been for this Cau&s;e hea|ped upon them. The famous Mr. <HI>Thomas Thacher</HI> was not reviled, for <HI>going out of his line,</HI> when he Publi&s;hed a Sheet of Directions, relating to the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> Forty three Years &s;ince.

<P N="8">&sect; 8. AFTER all, We have often heard that Maxim, <HI>That a Power to do Good not only gives a right, to the doing of it, but makes the doing it a Duty.</HI> And we humbly conceive, if it were more regarded, the <HI>World</HI> would many ways <HI>reap</HI> the <HI>Benefit</HI> of it. And to us it is very evident, that he that &s;ees his <HI>Neighbour</HI> expo&s;ed to any great danger, and can relieve him; not only has a <HI>Right,</HI> but &s;hould look on it as his <HI>Duty,</HI> to do &s;o.</P>

Now this being all the <HI>Crime,</HI> that is with any <HI>Shadow</HI> of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> charged upon our <HI>Mi|ni&s;ters,</HI> we cannot but look upon it, as the great|e&s;t <HI>inhumanity</HI> and blacken <HI>ingratitude</HI> to treat them in &s;uch a manner as they have been.
