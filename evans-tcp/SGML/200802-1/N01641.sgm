<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>NEHEMIAH V. 19.</HI></BIBL>
Think upon me, my GOD, for Good; accord|ing to all that I have done for this People.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A VERY &s;hort, but a very &s;erious, pathetical and plea&s;ant <HI>Prayer</HI> this&punc; Happy the man that is able to make it, and happy the People among whom there are many that can &s;olemnly make it. It is an <HI>Appeal</HI> to God re&s;pecting the faithful love and religious regards we bear to our <HI>Country,</HI> and to the In|tere&s;ts of God in it. It is a lifting up our hand to Heaven, and &s;wearing by Him that liveth and ruleth there, and to him to whom we owe and &s;hou'd bear true Faith and allegiance for ever and ever; that in our re&s;pective places we do and will live and act for Him and his People. It is in effect to &s;ay (and how awful is &s;uch an <HI>Oath</HI> to God) <HI>&s;o</HI> think upon me my God for Good, <HI>as</HI> I think upon this People with a &s;incere de&s;ire of their Good. Who of us now dare a&s;&s;ume the Words before the LORD, our King and our Judge? And yet who of us is there that may be Excu&s;able before him if we are
<PB N="2" REF="001949_0008_0FBA43A100E81DE0">
not able to do it? The man who&s;e Con&s;cience tells him that he bears an hone&s;t heart to his Country and the Religion of God in it, he may humbly make the <HI>Prayer</HI> and take the Comfort of it.</P>
<P>LET us now con&s;ider the <HI>Man</HI> that fir&s;t made it, the <HI>Time</HI> and the Occa&s;ion of his making it, and then the <HI>Prayer</HI> by it &s;elf.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE great &amp; good <HI>Man</HI> that made it was <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> who was twelve years <HI>Governour of Judea under Artexerxes King of Per&s;ia.</HI> He was a very pious and excellent Ruler, <HI>a Man that came to &s;eek the Welfare of the Children of I&s;rael.</HI> His whole &s;tory di&s;covers a very deep Tincture of &s;erious Piety in his Soul, that he was a man of much Devotion and very frequent and &s;olemn in Prayer. The &s;pirit of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> and <HI>Samuel</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> and of <HI>Jeho&s;haphat, Hezekiah</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> re&s;ted upon him in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>WE may profitably ob&s;erve what bro't him to his Government, and with what Di&s;po&s;ition of Mind he came, and on what Motives. He came not for Honour, or Riches, for he had eno' of the&s;e before, and knew, when he had eno', and had a heart large eno' not only to u&s;e 'em for his own Comfort, but to &s;pend 'em for the public Good. He had been the Kings <HI>Cup-bearer</HI>; an Office of high Honour and great Favour, and the Profit was to be &s;ure equal to the Dignity of the Po&s;t. By this he &s;tood in the Pre&s;ence of the King, and attended at his
<PB N="3" REF="001949_0009_0FBA43A24EDAE310">
Table in the Month of his Waiting, and <HI>gave the Wine into his Hand.</HI></P>
<P>NEITHER did he come to enjoy Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure. He might have had more of the&s;e at the Court. They that dwell in Kings Palaces go in &s;oft Cloathing, live &s;umptuou&s;ly and fare deliciou&s;ly every day. The danger there is of &s;urfeiting in &s;oft plea&s;ures. It may be that <HI>Nehemiah</HI> the rather left it for that Rea&s;on. And for what, in Exchange, did he for&s;ake the Voluptuous &s;cene? for <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in its Ruines! and <HI>the Remnant of the Captivity in great affliction and Reproach</HI>? This was what well became his Vertue and Devotion. He preferred the very du&s;t of <HI>Zion</HI> to the Gardens of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the broken Walls and Gates of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to the Palaces of <HI>Shu&s;han.</HI> He had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ather come to repair the&s;e than to dwell a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ea&s;e in them.</P>
<P>IN a word, as the Ca&s;e was truly Extraordi|nary, and &s;o the Rea&s;on of <HI>Nehemiahs</HI> &s;eeking the Government of <HI>Judah,</HI> even the Melancholy account that was given him of the pre&s;ent State of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>; &s;o in a very Extraordinary man|ner he prepared him&s;elf for the &s;ervice of his Country; <HI>He &s;at down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fa&s;ted and prayed to the God of Heaven</HI>; and his mo&s;t excellent Prayer which he prayed on this Occa&s;ion is recorded in the fir&s;t <HI>Chapter</HI> of this <HI>Book.</HI> Now it mu&s;t be ac|knowledged that the like Solemnity is not nece&s;&s;ary in every Commi&s;&s;ion for the Govern|ment
<PB N="4" REF="001949_0010_0FBA43A501419FF0">
of a <HI>Province</HI>; No, far otherwi&s;e; it may be much rather e&s;teem'd a Circum&s;tance of life calling for a devout <HI>Thank&s;giving</HI> to God: But only let there be an Acknowledgement of the Divine Providence governing our Changes and chu&s;ing for us our re&s;pective Offices; let us have a &s;en&s;e of our Dependance on God, our Obli|gations to him and our Accountablene&s;s, and let us be humbly &s;eeking his Pre&s;ence, Influence and Help always, without which we &s;hall never di&s;charge the Duties of the mo&s;t Inferior Tru&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT &s;o much for the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> here praying, <HI>Ne|hemiah,</HI> the Excellent Governour of poor <HI>Judea</HI>;
<Q>Who in my Eye (&s;ays a late pious Expo&s;itor) tho' he never wore a Crown, nor commanded an Army, nor conquer'd any Country, nor was fam'd for Philo&s;ophy or Oratory; yet being a pious praying Man and a &s;ingular Servant of the Church of God in his day, was really a Greater Man and more Honourable, not only than any of the <HI>Roman</HI> Con&s;uls or Dictators, but than <HI>Xenophon,</HI> or <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> or <HI>Plato</HI> him&s;elf, who liv'd at the &s;ame time the bright Ornaments of <HI>Greece.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="2">2. LET us ob&s;erve at what <HI>time</HI> &amp; upon what <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> it was that <HI>Nehemiah</HI> prayed the Words of my Text; It was &s;ome time after his arrival at his Government, and entrance upon the ad|mini&s;tration thereof. For as &s;oon as he came to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and had publi&s;h'd his Commi&s;&s;ion, he did in&s;tantly and with great Diligence
<PB N="5" REF="001949_0011_0FBA43A6D46E7030">
apply him&s;elf to the Work he came about, the Duties of his High Station. This he did with great Integrity and Honour: He did not lo&s;e a day in Diver&s;ions, but &s;et him&s;elf to Bu&s;ine&s;s. He built the Wall of Jeru&s;alem, and took care for the Repleni&s;hing the Holy City He took the Number of his People, he redre&s;s'd their Grievances, and reform'd divers great Di&s;or|ders and Abu&s;es. He look'd to their Morals and led them in the Wor&s;hip of God. He call'd 'em to tho&s;e &s;olemnities of Religion which their pre&s;ent State made &s;uitable, even to Fa&s;ting and Prayer, and their Renewing their Covenant with GOD.</P>
<P>IN this pious and princely manner did his Zeal, Piety and Charity work, with unknown Indu&s;try and Labour. And it is &s;carce to be &s;aid in what his Vertue mo&s;t appear'd, or in what Vertue he mo&s;t Excell'd; whether in Genero&s;ity to the public, in Tenderne&s;s to the poor and needy, in Compa&s;&s;ion to the Op|pre&s;&s;ed, in Courage toward the Rich and Great, the Rulers and Nobles; or in Indignation again&s;t the wicked, the &s;en&s;ual, the profane; the cruel and unju&s;t man.</P>
<P>INDEED there are &s;ome things here re|corded of this mo&s;t Excellent Governour, which tho' they were truly Glorious in Him, yet &s;trictly are not to be bro't into Example. Par|ticularly we are told in the Ver&s;es ju&s;t before the Text, <HI>that from the Time he took the Govern|ment He did not eat the Bread of the Governour.</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="001949_0012_0FBA43AA02008320">
He was not chargeable to 'em as his Prede|ce&s;&s;ors had been. He &s;erv'd 'em for nothing, he was &s;o rich and they &s;o poor, and his heart was as big as his pur&s;e; nay he made his &s;er|vants work for the public <HI>Gratis,</HI> whereas <HI>the &s;ervants of the former Governours bare rule over the people</HI>; &s;queezing them with one pretended Per|qui&s;ite or another. But <HI>Nehemiah</HI> was too much a Father to his People, and <HI>a Fearer of God</HI> to allow this. He neither dur&s;t do it nor was he Inclin'd to do it.</P>
<P>YET he kept the <HI>Table</HI> of a Prince, while he wou'd not require or accept the Bread of the Governour. There were at his Table daily an hundred and fifty of the Jews and Rulers, be|&s;ides Strangers; and accordingly there was daily prepar'd for him one Ox and &s;ix choice Sheep; with Fowls in &s;ome proportion, and once in ten days &s;tore of all &s;orts of Wine; and yet for all this he did not require the Bread of the Go|vernour, becau&s;e the Bondage was heavy upon the People.</P>
<P>NOW I &s;ay this is not to be bro't into Example to oblige Governours in other places and times, and not in like Circum&s;tances, to do the like. No, It wou'd be very vain and ridi|culous to pretend it. All that a Governour or Ruler is to learn from this Noble &s;pirit and action is this, to be Generous, to be tender of a People, to con&s;ider his own and their Circum|&s;tances; to moderate his De&s;ires after Gain, not to extort and &s;queeze him&s;elf, nor to let any that are under him do &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001949_0013_0FBA43AC4B12A7E0"><HI>NEHEMIAH</HI> had the Heart of a Chri&s;tian, (for the Godly are ju&s;t alike under both Te&s;ta|ments) and who can read the Record of his noble Deeds without remembring the Words of our Lord Je&s;us which he &s;pake, It is more ble&s;&s;ed to give than to receive. <HI>Act.</HI> 20.25. It argues a more ble&s;&s;ed Di&s;po&s;ition, and infers a more ble&s;&s;ed State.</P>
<P>AFTER all, Few Governours are rich like <HI>Nehemiah.</HI> He had ama&s;s'd great Riches in the Per&s;ian Court, and had been wont to live mag|nificently. And now he piou&s;ly (and I had almo&s;t &s;aid profu&s;ely) &s;pends it in the Service of the poor afflicted Church. He liv'd of his own in great State and Expence, for he had (he knew) wherewith to do it. And ble&s;&s;ed be God, Our Circum&s;tances are not like tho&s;e of the Remnant of the Captivity. We are poor eno' 'tis true, but not like them; nor are our Spirits lowr'd like theirs with our Condition. Look on us, and judge how poor we be! Look on our Cloathing, our Furniture; our Tables, our Children; and if it were not for &s;hame I had &s;aid our <HI>Balls,</HI> and &s;ay if we be Poor! Judge by our Idle hours and Idle Expences! if we are rich in the&s;e we mu&s;t not be poor only to the State and Church. We are well able to do much more than ever we yet have done for the honourable Support both of the Magi&s;tracy and the Mini&s;try, and &s;hould be never the poorer for it.</P>
<P>AND &s;o much for the time wherein <HI>Nehe|miah</HI> utter'd this prayer, a prayer which every
<PB N="8" REF="001949_0014_0FBA43ADD58A5FB0">
now &amp; then we find him repeating, and always beautiful in him becau&s;e &s;ea&s;onably utter'd.</P>
<P N="3">3. I COME now to con&s;ider the Prayer by it &s;elf: <HI>Think upon me my God for Good, according to all that I have d ne for this People.</HI></P>
<P>IF ever the words can become a Mortals mouth they became his. We mu&s;t put an humble Chri&s;tian &s;en&s;e upon 'em, which ex|cludes Boa&s;ting. Here's nothing in 'em but what is mode&s;t, lowly and aba&s;ing before God; Nothing Vain-glorious, but altogether gracious and devout. He could comfortably remember what he had done, and pray over it; and he knew how to pray, was us'd to it, even to re|member God of his Covenant Faithfulne&s;s and promi&s;ed Mercies.</P>
<P>HERE Ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE happy <HI>Freedom</HI> and Confidence with which he addre&s;&s;es God. <HI>My God.</HI> He claims, he pleads an Intere&s;t in him, a Relation to him. My God, <HI>who&s;e I am and whom I &s;erve.</HI> By God he rul'd, and for him only; by his Word and according to his Will, and for his Glory.</P>
<P N="2">2. HIS Reque&s;t. <HI>Think upon me.</HI> In which I wou'd remark two things, his Mode&s;ty and his Faith.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, THE <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> of his Petition. He asks to be tho't upon. Be&s;tow a kind tho't upon me, my God. That &s;hall be eno' to me, if my
<PB N="9" REF="001949_0015_0FBA43AF1622CB38">
God will but think upon me! that &s;hall be my pay and my exceeding Great Reward for all my Services to the Public. He look'd for no Recompence from men, nay &s;ome of them it may be might think, &s;peak and reward to him Evil for Good; but if God will remember his Good Deeds and not blot them out, he de&s;ires no more.</P>
<P>AND yet it is a Great thing that <HI>Nehemiah</HI> asks, and what the Greate&s;t and be&s;t of men are not worthy of. What, for the Great GOD of Heaven to be&s;tow a Tho't upon man that is a Worm, and the &s;on of man that is a Worm! When we con&s;ider his Heavens,&mdash; <HI>Lord what is man</HI> that thou art mindful of him! Yet many O Lord, and wonderful are thy Tho'ts to us|ward! It is a Reque&s;t meet for a <HI>Favourite</HI> to his Prince. <HI>Let my Lord remember his Handmaid.</HI> If he &s;ays, I'll think of you, I'll remember you, it is eno'.</P>
<P>Secondly, THE <HI>Faith</HI> of this prayer is re|markable. Nehemiah believed in God, and tru&s;ted that he wou'd remember him for Good. He comforted him&s;elf thus, My God thinketh on me. He came to God believing that he is a Rewarder. He believ'd that his God would think upon him? 1. for Good. 2. according to all his Good Deeds.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>FOR Good.</HI> Such are God's Tho'ts; <HI>thoughts of Good and not of Evil.</HI> Think upon me my God, but not to mark my &s;in. No, for then
<PB N="10" REF="001949_0016_0FBA43B276DA5008">
who cou'd &s;tand? let the&s;e be blotted out for ever &amp; ca&s;t away. Remember them no more. But if there has been any thing ever done in &s;incerity let my good God remember it. <HI>Ac|cording to thy Goodne&s;s remember me, for thy mercy &s;ake; O Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THINK upon me my God and a&s;&s;i&s;t, en|courage, protect, &s;ucceed and pro&s;per me. Think upon me and accept me in my de&s;ires to &s;erve thee and thy people: Let me find Grace in thy &s;ight. Think upon me to remunerate as thou plea&s;e&s;t, of thy free Grace, rich bounty and &s;overeign Mercy: Ble&s;s me my God, both in Temporals and Spirituals, but e&s;pecially the latter.</P>
<P N="2">2. ACCORD<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">G to his <HI>Deeds.</HI> Without good works done by us we may not pre&s;ume to look that God will ever think of us for good. For we may know then that there is neither any good thing wro't in us, nor in re&s;erve for us. Yet our be&s;t Doings can never merit any Favour from God. 'The Reward is not of debt, but of Grace altogether. If <HI>Abraham</HI> our Father were ju&s;tified by Works, he had whereof to glory. He believed in God which ju&s;tifieth &s;inners, and his Faith was counted to him for Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Yet his Faith wro't in his Works, and by Works his Faith was made per|fect. In like manner <HI>Nehemiah</HI> claim'd nothing as of debt, but manife&s;tly asks all of meer Grace,&mdash; Think upon me, my God. Indeed he expre&s;&s;es the Con&s;cience he had of his own Sincerity before God, and his Faith in the
<PB N="11" REF="001949_0017_0FBA43B613A1C1C0">
Promi&s;e and Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God. He &s;pake upon the Principle which David lays down, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 18.24,&mdash;28. <HI>With an upright man Thou wilt &s;hew thy &s;elf Upright, with the pure thou wilt &s;hew thy &s;elf pure, and with the froward thou wilt &s;hew thy &s;elf froward.</HI> This is the equal and righteous Rule of God's Government and Judgment.</P>
<P>BUT this excellent man is yet more particu|lar and exact in his Petition. 1. He &s;peaks of <HI>all</HI> that he had done. 2. he &s;peaks of it as all done <HI>for this People.</HI></P>

<P>NO man is made only for <HI>him&s;elf</HI> and his own private affairs, but to &s;erve profit &amp; benefit others. We are manife&s;tly formed for <HI>Society,</HI> and de&s;ign'd by our Great Creator for a mutual dependance on and &s;erviceablene&s;s unto each other here in the body. Both the Safety and the Plea&s;ure of life depend upon our joint pro|po&s;ing and pur&s;uing this de&s;ign.

<PB N="16" REF="001949_0022_0FBA43C2446780A0">
he ought to be &s;o. As <HI>Cain</HI> was of that wicked one, &s;o is he of <HI>Cain</HI> who thinks him&s;elf not born for the Welfare of others, but meerly for him|&s;elf and his own petty private and temporal Concerns. And like <HI>Cain</HI> he de&s;erves to be cur&s;ed from the earth, and driven from the face of men, as well as hid from the face of God; a fugitive and a vagabond, and afraid of every one he &s;ees. This is a due puni&s;hment of &s;o barbarous a Principle. For as the man re|nounces others, &s;o mu&s;t they him; and while he declares that others mu&s;t look for no Good from him, they may well apprehend all ima|ginable Evil and mi&s;chief from him, and he from them again. For his Principle runs him into all manner of Inju&s;tice and Injury, barbarity and bloodine&s;s, as it did <HI>Cain</HI>; and the Earth cannot bear the mon&s;ter, but cries for venge|ance again&s;t him.</P>
<P>A mans private and dome&s;tic affairs are too <HI>petite</HI> to engro&s;s his noble Soul; they are too &s;mall and narrow a Compa&s;s for him to confine him&s;elf within. He is endow'd for much greater things, and he much deba&s;es him&s;elf if he do not think &s;o.</P>
<P>BUT our <HI>Country,</HI> and the particular <HI>Places</HI> where we dwell, are ordinarily the bounds of our Influence. E&s;pecially is it &s;o as to com|mon and ordinary people, who are known only in their own Nei'bourhood, and find eno' near home to keep 'em imploy'd. And here prudence as well as charity teaches us to begin.</P>

If a man has <HI>Riches</HI> and a heart to do good with it, he may be not only a Father to the Poor but to his Coun|try al&s;o; defending it from dangers and redee|ming it from mi&s;ery.

<P>IF what has been already &s;aid be not &s;uffici|ent to convince us of our Obligation to propo&s;e and pur&s;ue the common good of our Country, I appeal then to the <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> of every man, Whether his own heart do not approve &amp; applaud &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition as very excellent in it &s;elf. What el&s;e can at pre&s;ent fully an&s;wer the End of thy Being, rational Endowments, and the Relation thou beare&s;t to Mankind? can you be good, and ju&s;t in your Place without it? can the Being and End of Humane Society be an&s;wer'd without it? is not this one point wherein men

have preheminence above the bea&s;ts? Nay is it not a kind of In&s;tinct in Nature, which is un|accountable and irre&s;i&s;tible; a &s;ecret invincible affection to ones Country, as unto &s;ome natural Relation in blood? and does it not afford a man a noble and la&s;ting &s;atisfaction if he has been honour'd to do it &s;ervice? is it not agreeable to <HI>humane nature</HI> to be generous, compa&s;&s;ionate, ob|liging, grateful, beneficent? and is it not the Image of the Great Creator in&s;tamp'd upon us, who is good to all and has a tender Care over all his Works?
<Q>Nay are not the wor&s;t of men them&s;elves a&s;ham'd to avow Self-intere&s;t as a Principle of their actions, as being con&s;cious to them&s;elves that it is the ba&s;e&s;t of all Princi|ples?

It cannot be (&s;ayes Mr. <HI>Collier</HI>) that God &s;hould give man <HI>Solitary Principles</HI> and yet intend him for Public Con|ver&s;e? make his Intere&s;t depend upon Mu|tual Affection, and at the &s;ame time create him &s;o as natually to care for nothing but him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>BUT while I am upon this head, proving our Obligation to a <HI>General Kindne&s;s</HI> and Pub|lic Spirit from the light of Nature, it may not be ami&s;s to remark &s;omething of the noble &s;en&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="001949_0027_0FBA43C960DC2BA0">
that the <HI>Romans</HI> had in this matter. I will name three only, <HI>Cato, Cicero,</HI> and the Emperor <HI>Marcus Antoninus</HI>; and add to them the Principles of the <HI>Stoicks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>CATO</HI> the Younger was an admir'd and ce|lebrated lover of his Country, and a very faith|ful zealous a&s;&s;erter of the rights &amp; liberties of it. <HI>Plutarch</HI> tells us among other things, that when his friends could not per&s;wade him to &s;tand for the <HI>Tribune-&s;hip,</HI> yet when <HI>Metellus</HI> was put up from whom he feared danger to the State, he pre&s;ently &s;tood for the Place him&s;elf and carry'd it; for the People look'd upon him (&s;ayes the <HI>Hi&s;torian</HI>) not as one that de&s;ir'd a favour of them, but one that &s;ought it to do his Country a kindne&s;s, and that he might defend their Li|berty and Government. Wherefore at another time when by his courage and wi&s;dom in oppo|&s;ing <HI>Clodius,</HI> he had driven him out of Town, (he had made him appear &s;o infamous) and <HI>Ci|cero</HI> came to thank him for it; he an&s;wer'd, <HI>Thank the Common-wealth,</HI> for who&s;e &s;ake alone it is that I do every thing.</P>
<P>INDEED <HI>Cicero</HI> was of the &s;ame noble Spi|rit, and a like worthy Patriot to his Country. He was the man among the <HI>Romans</HI> that fir&s;t had that &s;ingular <HI>Style</HI> of honour decreed him, <HI>Pater patriae, the Father of his Country</HI> A dignity pre|ferable to the being born to Empire over it. And it is remarkable that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> him&s;elf who had Sa|crificed him to the Malice of <HI>Antonius</HI> for his own Advancement to the Imperial Chair, yet honour'd his Memory for his faithful Oppo&s;ition
<PB N="22" REF="001949_0028_0FBA43CE1C445BD0">
to him in that de&s;ign: for <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> vi&s;iting his Dau'ters Son found him with a Book of <HI>Cicero</HI>'s in his hand; the Boy for fear endeavour'd to hid it under his gown; which <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> perceiving took it from him, and after he had turn'd over a great part of it gave it him again, &s;aying, My Child, this was a Learned man and <HI>a lover of his Country.</HI></P>
<P>I will only add a &s;aying of <HI>Marcus Antoninus,</HI> one of the be&s;t of the <HI>Roman Emperors.</HI> As you are a member of a Society, &s;o every action of yours &s;hould tend to the benefit and improve|ment of it. So that when you do any thing that has neither immediate nor remote reference to general advantage, you make a breach in the common Intere&s;t, de&s;troy the Unity of Public life, and are as really guilty of Seditious behavi|our as a Male-content that imbroils the Go|vernment.</P>
<P>THIS Principle was well worthy of <HI>Him</HI> that was at the Head of the World, and indeed the Happine&s;s and Glory of the <HI>Empire</HI> &s;eem'd to ex|pire in him. Such were the Principles of the <HI>Stoicks,</HI> "That we &s;hould love all Man kind heartily,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gatakers</HI> Prelim. di&s;c.</NOTE> &s;olicit their In|tere&s;ts, bear with their Infirmities, and do no manner of injury to any man: "That a man &s;hould not think him&s;elf born for his private Satisfaction, but exert him|&s;elf for the Public, and make his life as &s;ignifi|cant to the world as it is po&s;&s;ible: "That the Con&s;cience of a good action &s;hould content a

man, without the pro&s;pect of fame and reward: that he ought never to be tir'd with the exerci&s;e of good nature, &mdash; but look upon a generous action as a reward to it &s;elf. The&s;e are &s;ome of the noble Sentences which we find in the wri|tings of the <HI>Stoicks,</HI> which <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> may read with blu&s;hes, reflecting on their own defects in practice.</P>
<P>NOT but that the Precepts of <HI>CHRIST OUR SAVIOUR</HI> do far excel all that <HI>Seneca, Cicero, Epictetus, Antoninus</HI> or all the <HI>Ma&s;ters of Morality</HI> have &s;aid on this Argument; and from hence it is that our Obligations ri&s;e higher than theirs cou'd to live unto the benefit of others. And as it much rather becomes me in this desk, &s;o it &s;hould be much more acceptable unto a Chri&s;tian Audience, to ob&s;erve the excelling In|&s;titutions of the Go&s;pel on this Argument. For we are in&s;tructed from the <HI>Divine Oracles,</HI> "To <HI>love our Nei'bours as our &s;elves; "What&s;oever we would that men &s;hould do to us to do the &s;ame to them, and "as we have opportunity to do good to all men, e&s;pecially unto the hou&s;hold of faith; "That we &s;hould deny our &s;elves, and that NONE OF US LIVETH TO HIMSELF; "That no man &s;hould &s;eek his own &s;ingly, but every man his brothers wealth; "That we look not every man on his own things, but every man al&s;o on the things of others; "That we be kindly affectioned one to another in brotherly love, in honour preferring one another; "That nothing be done thro' &s;trife and vain glory, but in lowline&s;s of mind that each e&s;teem other better than him&s;elf.</HI></P>

It is <HI>this</HI> that has honour'd us among the <HI>Provinces,</HI> and been the &s;upport of that Religion and vertue which is left among us. Our wi&s;e and pious <HI>Fathers</HI> in the Settlement of the Country planted <HI>Schools</HI> as well as Churches in every Town. Religion and Learning were their equal Care; and I tru&s;t will be their Chil|drens. Hence it is that they have left an In|&s;tructed Seed as at this day. That happy foun|dation the COLLEGE, &s;upply'd from the <HI>Grammar Schools</HI> thro' the <HI>Province,</HI> has not only &s;ent forth a number of worthy men for the Pul|pit, but al&s;o for every Chair of honour in the Government. Not only have our Churches had a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Pa&s;tors,</HI> but the State al&s;o of <HI>Judges</HI> and <HI>Coun&s;ellors,</HI> and &s;ome mo&s;t Excellent <HI>Governours</HI> have our <HI>Provinces</HI> &s;een, the fair Sons of that beautiful <HI>Academy.</HI> And whatever De|cays the <HI>Province</HI> langui&s;hes under in other re|&s;pects the <HI>College</HI> &s;eems to renew its Youth, and

And now we have the Joy to come before You, <HI>our civil Fathers,</HI> as the Sons of the Prophets once did to <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> &s;aying, Be|hold now the Place is too <HI>&s;trait</HI> for the increas'd numbers of your Sons! will you plea&s;e to en|large the Hou&s;e for them to dwell in?

<P>BUT, <HI>my Fathers,</HI> what &s;ignifies a <HI>College</HI> if there be not a previous care about inferiour <HI>Schools,</HI> in your &s;everal Towns? Let the&s;e live I be&s;eech you; let 'em be worthily &s;upplied and decently &s;upported; let not the Law in that matter be any where &s;candalou&s;ly evaded. If our Schools langui&s;h &s;o will the State &amp; Church too. We &s;hall &s;oon grow an Irreligious and a contemptible People if we decay in good Lite|rature. The Education of our Youth is of the la&s;t Importance to our future flouri&s;hing in ver|tue, in piety, in arts, in riches, in wi&s;dom and reputation. What had we been at this day if it had not been for the pious care of our <HI>Ance&s;tors</HI> in this matter? and what will our Po&s;terity be|come if we degenerate from them in this point? What will the Government become? and what the Mini&s;try? We &s;hall have no <HI>&s;trong Rods</HI> to bear rule, nor <HI>able Mini&s;ters of the New Te&s;tament.</HI>

Nor will the world believe that we are the Sons of <HI>New-England,</HI> who&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing Character among the Plantations has been <HI>Sobriety, Mode&s;ty and Literature.</HI> But we have found &s;o much the Benefit of Learning that I will not give my &s;elf leave to doubt of your faithful care for it.

And now this private Spirit grows manife&s;tly upon us from year to year; every body rai&s;ing the price of their own Commodity, and tho&s;e the Nece&s;&s;aries of life more than the Superfluities; and every body acting by one common rule of Mutual Oppre&s;&s;ion, namely <HI>to get what they can,</HI> without any con&s;cientious tender regards to the rule of Ju&s;tice and Mercy, at lea&s;t in the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s.

<P>TRULY I fear, unle&s;s it plea&s;es God to re|buke this private Spirit among us, that in a lit|tle time the <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion of our Poor</HI> may come to be near as great as that of the <HI>Jews,</HI> whereof there was &s;o great a cry made in our Context, who&s;e &s;ufferings <HI>Nehemiah</HI> did as well &s;et him&s;elf to redre&s;s, as he did the Sabbath-breaking and im|pure mixtures.

When <HI>Nehemiah</HI> heard this his Anger was very great at the Oppre&s;&s;ors. He rebuk'd 'em, he call'd <HI>a General A&s;&s;embly</HI> to redre&s;s the wrong.

a ju&s;t and upright <HI>Ruler</HI>: for whatever a mans Accompli&s;hments may be, if Covetou&s;ne&s;s bear rule in him, that man is not fit to bear rule over others.

He pre&s;ented him&s;elf in a va&s;t A&s;&s;embly of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and dar'd to &s;ay to 'em, <HI>I am now old and gray-headed and my Sons are with you; and I have walked before you from my Childhood un|to this day; Behold here I am, witne&s;s again&s;t me before the Lord and before his Anointed; Who&s;e ox have I taken? or who&s;e a&s;s have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppre&s;&s;ed? or of who&s;e hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? And they &s;aid, Thou ha&s;t not de|frauded us, nor oppre&s;&s;ed us; neither ha&s;t thou taken ought of any mans hand. And he &s;aid unto them, The Lord is witne&s;s, and his Anointed is witne&s;s this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;econd was <HI>Job, that perfect and upright man,</HI> who refre&s;h'd him&s;elf in his <HI>a&s;hes</HI> &amp; <HI>boils</HI> when Providence &s;eem'd to have thrown him by as a broken ve&s;&s;el; for <HI>his Righteou&s;ne&s;s he hold fa&s;t and would not let it go; and his heart did not
<PB N="52" REF="001949_0058_0FBA4404CCF6DCE8">
reproach him within,</HI> tho' his ulcers were nau&s;eous and painful without. He remember'd how he was wont <HI>to go out to the Gate,</HI> and <HI>when he pre|pared his &s;eat in the &s;treet</HI>; how when <HI>the ear heard him it ble&s;&s;ed him, and when the eye &s;aw him it bare witne&s;s to him; how he delivered the poor that cryed and the fatherle&s;s, and how he brake the jaws of the wicked</HI>; and he appeals to God <HI>if his &s;tep had turned out of the way, and his heart walk'd after his eyes, or any blot had cleaved to his hand.</HI> Thus <HI>his witne&s;s was in Heaven, and his record was on high.</HI></P>
<P>THE third was <HI>Hezekiah</HI> that great and good King of <HI>Judah,</HI> who being &s;ick unto death re|ceiv'd a me&s;&s;age from God to &s;et his hou&s;e in order; upon which he was able to look up to God and &s;ay&mdash; <HI>Remember now O Lord I be&s;eech thee, how I h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy &s;ight.</HI> A mighty Prayer for a <HI>dying King</HI>! happy the <HI>Ruler</HI> that can Pray thus in his la&s;t hours! in &s;uch peace and comfort we have &s;een &s;ome of our faithful Rulers lately expire. And may the Con&s;olations of God abound to all that &s;urvive in their Spirit.</P>
<P N="2">2. WILL God think of Public Spirited Per|&s;ons for good? <HI>then let it be a Rule and law to us to do &s;o too.</HI> It is but Ju&s;tice and Gratitude in a People to remember and reward the Public Ser|vices &amp; Benefits done them by any. Never let our <HI>Benefactors</HI> be forgotten by us. That Country little de&s;erves any that is not careful and ju&s;t to acknowledge and honour 'em. Who will think
<PB N="53" REF="001949_0059_0FBA44068C591E18">
upon that People for good, who do not grate|fully think on them that do 'em great and mani|fe&s;t kindne&s;&s;es? Nay will God think upon 'em, to rai&s;e 'em up more friends?</P>
<P>THE <HI>Rulers</HI> of a People are the Judges of be|nefits or injuries done to the Public; and 'its a matter wherein they ought to &s;et them&s;elves to judge calmly and impartially. And I am bold to &s;ay, they are not Public Spirited if they do it not. And if they judge in their con&s;ciences that great Good has been done to their Country by any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, the Public thanks and regards (as the matter may require) are due to &s;uch Per&s;ons, be they of <HI>our &s;elves</HI> or be they <HI>Strangers,</HI> by the &s;tricte&s;t rules of honour and hone&s;ty, as well as wi&s;dom and policy. This is an eternal Principle of truth, and rule of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE let this People ever think of them for good who are honour'd of God to do 'em good. Be they <HI>dead</HI>? let their Names live with us: let them be had in everla&s;t|ing remembrance: Do they yet <HI>remain</HI> with us? let us always think of 'em with love and honour, let us ble&s;s and pray for 'em, (<HI>May they live and not die, and let not their Names be few</HI>) and if need be let us &s;tand by and defend 'em; ac|counting 'em among <HI>the Good Men for whom one would even dare to die.</HI></P>
<P>BUT God forbid among us that ba&s;e and helli&s;h &s;pirit, which we our &s;elves have known in other Places wi&s;er &amp; greater than we, where|by the be&s;t <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Servants</HI> of the Public
<PB N="54" REF="001949_0060_0FBA44084E0F4610">
have been by &s;ome factiou&s;ly and maliciou&s;ly defam'd, bely'd, revil'd; and the vile &s;landers as ea&s;ily taken up &amp; weakly given into by others; to the ruine of the Public, &amp; to the grief &amp; &s;hame of good men that love it. Such was the guilt and wretchedne&s;s of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the day of <HI>Abime|lech,</HI> and the <HI>Moral of Jothams fable</HI> was to re|prove and reproach the ba&s;e ingratitude. Mind how he introduces it, &mdash; <HI>Hearken to me ye men of Shechem that God may hearken to you!</HI> &mdash; and how he clo&s;es it, &mdash; <HI>Now therefore if ye have done truly and &s;incerely, if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his hou&s;e, and have done unto him according to the de&s;erving of his hands</HI> &mdash;. But was this only <HI>Jothams</HI> private re&s;entment? No, the Ingratitude was fir&s;t to Heaven which had rai&s;ed up <HI>Gideon</HI> for them, and the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> &s;peaks of it with in|dignation, Judges 8.34, 35. <HI>And the children of I&s;|rael remember'd not the Lord their God who had deli|ver'd 'em, neither &s;hewed they kindne&s;s to the hou&s;e of Gideon, according to all the Goodne&s;s which he had &s;hewn to I&s;rael.</HI> &mdash; But far be any thing like this from this People.</P>
<P>ONCE more,</P>
<P N="3">3. IF God will think of Public Spirited Per&s;ons for good? then how do you think he will <HI>re|member them for evil that hurt and injure his People</HI>? and what a melancholly reflection does our Text lead them into, who are <HI>carele&s;s of doing any thing for its good</HI>?</P>
<P>WHAT is there for God to think upon, done by too many in the places and with the talents a&s;&s;igned them? Go <HI>wicked and &s;lothful Servant,</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="001949_0061_0FBA440D92E05DF0">
carry thy Lord his Money, and tell him thou ha&s;t hid it in the earth, but that he has his own a|gain, tho' without u&s;e or improvement: but tremble to think what you will hear from him again, <HI>Take the unprofitable wretch away, and ca&s;t him into utter darkne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the hurtful and injurious to his People, God will remember them to judge 'em: as <HI>Ne|hemiah</HI> imprecated again&s;t &s;piteful <HI>Tobiah</HI> &amp; fal&s;e <HI>Sanballat,</HI> Neh. 6.14. <HI>My God think thou upon them according to their works, and on the re&s;t that would have put me in fear.</HI> The&s;e <HI>re&s;t</HI> were from among them&s;elves, ba&s;er to this good man than his <HI>Sa|maritan</HI> foes; for there were many in <HI>Judah &s;worn to Tobiah,</HI> (a thing mo&s;t horrible to hear) and of them &s;ome <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Nobles</HI> treache|rou&s;ly corre&s;ponded with him by Letters; Men that &s;lily &s;pake well of him to <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> and who as ba&s;ely betray'd him to <HI>Tobiah.</HI> (See <HI>Chap.</HI> 6.17, 18, 19.) Thus they vext their <HI>good Go|vernour,</HI> trying to di&s;pirit him &amp; weary him out. All their tho'ts were again&s;t him for evil, but his God tho't upon him.</P>
<P>IF any that hear me this day bear an ill will again&s;t this People, let me cordially advi&s;e 'em to forbear, and to fear to injure 'em; for God <HI>&s;ees mi&s;chief and &s;pite to requite it with his hand</HI>; he remember'd the children of <HI>Edom,</HI> their in|&s;ult and cruelty in the day of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> And we know the times when he &s;uffer'd no man to do them wrong, yea he reproved Kings for their &s;ake; and they that touched 'em touched the apple of his eye.</P>
