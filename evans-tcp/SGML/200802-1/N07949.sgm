</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE exceeding Riches of divine Grace in our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, afford us matter for Wonder, Love and Admiration. That the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hould &s;o wonderfully conde&s;cend, for our Salvation, as to be born of a poor Virgin, <HI>be made of a Woman, made under the Law, that he might redeem them that were under the Law:</HI> that he &s;hould humble him&s;elf to all tho&s;e ignominious Circum&s;tances in which he lived and died; he <HI>humbled him&s;elf, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cro&s;s,</HI> when, with infinite Ea&s;e, he could have &s;poken all his Per&s;ecutors into the very Deeps of Hell. This is wonderful. But what is &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hing, and &s;peaks the Heights and Depths of infinite boundle&s;s Love, is that he &s;hould <HI>wed</HI> &s;uch vile Worms of the Du&s;t, &s;uch polluted Mon&s;ters, who <HI>have played the Harlot with many Lovers,</HI> and take them into the Arms of his Love, yea into his Bo&s;om, to all the Indearments of that wonderful Relation in the new and everla&s;ting Covenant, in which Chri&s;t and Believers are one. That Chri&s;t &s;hould be a Hu&s;|band for Souls, a loving, kind and tender Hu&s;band, expre&s;&s;ed in his GIVING HIMSELF for them: And that he &s;hould <HI>&s;o give him&s;elf a Ran&s;om</HI> for them, that he might purcha&s;e to him&s;elf a glorious Church <HI>without Spot or Wrinkle, or any &s;uch Thing,</HI> mu&s;t appear to be infinite Love and Conde&s;cention. And this is the very Ca&s;e; the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;eeks this in all he has done,
<PB N="6" REF="010146_0003_0F7D1CB1C310C270">
and is doing as Mediator. This is the End, the important End of the Go&s;pel; and for this noble, glorious Purpo&s;e are the Mini&s;ters of it &s;ent forth; and thus we read 2. Cor V. 20. <HI>Now then we are Amba&s;&s;adors for Chri&s;t, as though God did be&s;eech you by us, we pray you, in Chri&s;t's Stead, be ye reconciled unto God.</HI> And according to this, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle in the Text, <HI>I have e&s;pou&s;ed you to one Hu&s;band,</HI> i. e. I have been the In&s;trument of it. I have drawn up the Contract fairly before you, and have be&s;ought, and prayed you, in Chri&s;t's Stead, to be reconciled to God; and I per&s;uade my &s;elf that I have been &s;o happy as to be in&s;trumental of bringing many of you into that ble&s;&s;ed Marriage Covenant with Chri&s;t: And this was one great View I had in it <HI>that</HI> I might at la&s;t pre&s;ent you as a cha&s;te Virgin to Chri&s;t, pre&s;ent you holy and pure, true and faith|ful to him, according to the true Intent of the Covenant, to his Acceptance and Glory, and your Joy and Comfort.</P>
<P>Therefore was the holy Apo&s;tle <HI>Jealous over them with a godly Jealou&s;y,</HI> i. e. he had a tender Fear and Concern for them, when their fal&s;e Teachers were endeavouring to &s;educe and lead them a|way from the Simplicity of the Go&s;pel, and to undervalue him, although he had been the In&s;trument of their Conver&s;ion from Heatheni&s;m to Chri&s;tianity, and had planted the Go&s;pel among them with indefatigable Pains and Indu&s;try. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 18.3, 9, 10, 11.</NOTE> And indeed it mu&s;t give every true and faithful Mini&s;ter a very painful and affecting Concern to &s;ee the LORD's FLOCK carried away captive; and in Danger of being devoured with greedy Wolves: to &s;ee them that they have laboured to e&s;pou&s;e to one Hu&s;band, Chri&s;t, &s;nared and led away after other Lovers; for how &s;hall they pre&s;ent &s;uch as a cha&s;te Virgin to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>That they may be the happy In&s;truments of Souls being e&s;pou&s;ed to Chri&s;t, and pre&s;ent them finally, to him, pure, holy and &s;pot|le&s;s is the great De&s;ign of their Office. For this they are Amba&s;|&s;adors. And O how ble&s;&s;ed to be &s;uccesful! How greatly to be de&s;ired?</P>
<P>Suffer me then to treat this noble and divine Subject under the following Propo&s;itions, viz.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="7" REF="010146_0004_0F7D1CB2631844A8">I. As it is the great De&s;ign, &s;o it &s;hould be the earne&s;t De&s;ire and Endeavour of the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t to e&s;pou&s;e Souls to him, as to one Hu&s;band.</P>
<P N="2">II. Tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who are made the happy In&s;truments of e&s;pou&s;ing Souls to Chri&s;t &s;hall have the great Honor, the un&s;peaka|ble Satisfaction, Joy and Comfort of pre&s;enting them as a cha&s;te Virgin to him.</P>
<P>I return to the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="1">I. As it is the great De&s;ign, &s;o it &s;hould be the earne&s;t De&s;ire and Endeavor of the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t to e&s;pou&s;e Souls to him, as to one Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Here I would, by divine Help, &s;hew,</P>
<P N="1">1. What it is for Souls to be e&s;pou&s;ed to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. That this is the great End and De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel Mini|&s;try. And therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. That it &s;hould be the earne&s;t De&s;ire and Endeavor of Mi|ni&s;ters to e&s;pou&s;e Souls to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. I am to &s;hew what it is for Souls to be e&s;pou&s;ed to the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>And this, &s;urely, can be nothing le&s;s than <HI>to be united to him in the Covenant of Grace, by Faith.</HI></P>
<P>It has plea&s;ed God, in his infinite Love, to think upon our fallen guilty Race, who had broken the Covenant of Works, and brought them&s;elves thereby, under it's &s;evere and terrible, though infinitely righteous, Cur&s;e. When that holy Covenant could afford us no Help, but, on the contrary, doomed us to eternal Woes: the ve|ry Moment we might expect the tremendous Di&s;plays of divine Ju&s;tice, behold, the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us appears in the precious Promi&s;e! God &s;ays Help upon one that is <HI>mighty to &s;ave, able to &s;ave all, even to the uttermo&s;t, that come unto God by him.</HI> God reveals his mo&s;t gracious Covenant for his cho&s;en People, in and through Chri&s;t, who <HI>is the Mediator of the New Te&s;tament, that by Means of Death, for the Redemption of the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions that were under the fir&s;t Te&s;tament, they which are called might receive the Promi&s;e of eter|nal Inheritance</HI>&punc; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">eo. 9 15.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="010146_0005_0F7D1CB32BFD4E88">It is indeed very wonderful that ever the glorious JEHOVAH &s;hould take &s;uch a Method for our Salvation. That ever there &s;hould be &s;uch a Thing as an everla&s;ting Covenant, between the Father and the Son, for our Redemption: that the eternal Son of God &s;hould be the Mediator of the new Covenant, the Covenant of Grace, in which all true Believers are united to Chri&s;t, by a divine Faith. By this mo&s;t gracious Covenant are the Faithful &s;aved from de&s;erved Wrath, and <HI>rai&s;ed up to &s;it together in heavenly Places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> to his eternal Glory.</P>
<P>This is a Covenant that has it's Foundation all laid in Grace; for it is a Covenant of Mercy for Covenant Breakers; a Covenant of Grace for guilty, Hell de&s;erving Creatures, for ever inca|pable of helping them&s;elves in any Mea&s;ure at all. And O how great this &s;alvation! God the Father lays the Foundation, and in the Fulne&s;s of Time gives his own only Son out of his Bo&s;om; Chri&s;t comes, and lays down his Life, and purcha&s;es all the Ble&s;&s;|ings of the Covenant: the holy Spirit is given to <HI>open our Eyes, and to turn us from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God; that we may receive Forgivne&s;s of Sins, and Inheritance among them which are &s;anctified by Faith that is in Chri&s;t.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts 26.18.</NOTE> The poor Soul is taken mo&s;t freely, out of his unregenerate State, <HI>in the Day of</HI> God's <HI>Power</HI>; cut off from the wild Olive, and graffed in|to the true; planted in Chri&s;t; born from above, being begotten again to a lively Hope by the Re&s;urrection from the Dead, and made a Partaker of the divine Nature.</P>
<P>To bring this to pa&s;s, God is plea&s;ed to write to us the great Things of his Law, and <HI>thunder</HI> forth the terrible Cur&s;es thereof from Mount Sinai. To &s;et Home, upon the Con&s;cience, the awful Truths of his holy Word, and awaken the &s;ecure Sinner by a Spirit of Conviction; to &s;hew him his lo&s;t E&s;tate, his guilty, filthy Circum&s;tances; that he is ju&s;tly de&s;erving of the divine Di&s;plea&s;ure, and going to De&s;truction, and unable to help him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is true that God has appointed various Duties to be done; the Word, Sacraments and Prayer are the outward and ordinary Means by which Chri&s;t communicates to us the Benefits of Redemption.
<PB N="9" REF="010146_0006_0F7D1CB3E1D69900">
And the&s;e Duties are to be attended as proper Means of Grace, yet will never &s;ave a Soul, nor can they give Relief to one under &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Circum&s;tances. No, <HI>without Faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e</HI> God, or to gain any true Comfort to the Soul. True God is plea&s;ed to order the Word of Faith, the ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel to be preached to them that are in &s;uch a Condition; &s;o God has written to us the great Things of his Go&s;pel, and <HI>to us is the Word of this Salvation &s;ent.</HI> Chri&s;t was &s;ent, and his Mini&s;ters are &s;ent <HI>to proclaim Liberty to the Captives, and the Opening of the Pri&s;on to them that are bound</HI>; and not only &s;o but al&s;o to call even to the Ends of the Earth to <HI>look</HI> unto Chri&s;t <HI>and be &s;aved</HI>; to <HI>behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the Sin of the World.</HI> And hence we find the Apo&s;tles Paul and Silas, exhorting the trembling Jaylor <HI>to believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and he &s;hould be &s;aved.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts 16.31.</NOTE> Never|thele&s;s the Arm of the Lord mu&s;t be <HI>revealed,</HI> or the Go&s;pel <HI>Report</HI> will not be <HI>believed</HI> even by the convinced Sinner. In the Day of God's Power his &s;tubborn Will &s;hall be bowed, and the Word of the Go&s;pel be made the effectual Means of his Conver&s;ion and Salvation. The Eyes of his Under&s;tanding are opened to a divine Di&s;covery of the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer in his Mediatorial Fulne&s;s and Glory. To behold <HI>his Glory, the Glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of Grace and Truth</HI>; and <HI>of his Fulne&s;s to receive, and Grace for Grace.</HI> To receive him as the <HI>End of the Law for Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believeth</HI>: to ca&s;t his whole Soul upon him and re&s;t upon him, as the only Propitiation for our Sins, and not for our's only, but al&s;o for the &s;ins of the whole World. To ac|quie&s;ce, mo&s;t heartily and freely, in the only Way of Salvation by him. To take him upon his own Terms, or Propo&s;als of Agree+ment, embrace him by Faith and Love, and cleave unto him with a cordial Affection, from a Sen&s;e of his infinite Worth and Excel|lence, divine Amiablene&s;s and tran&s;cendant Beauty and Glory. Thus are Souls e&s;pou&s;ed unto Chri&s;t as to one Hu&s;band, joined unto him, and made one with him in the new Covenant, ordered in all Things, and &s;ure: And the&s;e be they which follow the Lamb whither&s;oever he goeth. I proceed to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="10" REF="010146_0007_0F7D1CB4A9963D80">II. That it is the great End and de&s;ign of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try to e&s;pou&s;e Souls to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Now if the Mini&s;ters of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, are &s;ent to preach the Go&s;pel, to preach Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord, to preach Repentance to|wards God, and Faith towards the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, it mu&s;t be the De&s;ign of their Mini&s;try to bring Souls to e&s;pou&s;e the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>It is not here to be &s;uppo&s;ed that it lies in their Power to bring Souls to e&s;pou&s;e the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but that Chri&s;t does it by them, and they &s;hould de&s;ire and endeavour to be in&s;trumental of it. The go&s;pel Covenant is that only in which Souls are e&s;pou&s;ed to Chri&s;t. And it is this that Mini&s;ters are to preach; and they are to make U&s;e of the Go&s;pel Arguments and Motives for this great Purpo&s;e. To exhibit the &s;weet and powerful Invitations, Calls and Promi&s;es of it, that by the&s;e they may be &s;weetly <HI>compelled</HI> to come to the Marriage of the King's Son, and partake of the great Go&s;pel Supper. Moreover, Mini&s;ters are Amba&s;&s;adors of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us. So our Apo&s;tle, <HI>Now then, we are Amba&s;&s;adors for Chri&s;t, as tho' God did be&s;eech you by us; we pray you in Chri&s;t's Stead, be ye recon|ciled to God.</HI> Great and &s;overeign Princes &s;ometimes &s;end their Amba&s;&s;adors into foreign Countries, to obtain, by Suit, a Bride for them&s;elves. And the Lord Je&s;us does &s;o likewi&s;e, he &s;ends his Mini&s;ters to &s;eek a Bride for him&s;elf; to invite and call Souls to a Marriage with him in the Covenant of Grace. Hence we find our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour di&s;cour&s;ing of the Kingdom of Heaven by Way of Similitude likning it to a certain King that made a Marriage for his Son, and &s;ent forth his &s;ervants to invite and call Gue&s;ts to the Wedding, Mat. 22.1, 10. We have the &s;ame Thing in Sub|&s;tance in Luke 14.16, 24. This, this is the great Thing they are &s;ent upon to bring Souls to the Marriage, and mu&s;t gather them even out of the Highways and Hedges, that our Lord's Hou&s;e may be filled. O then how &s;hould the Love of Chri&s;t con&s;train them! Methinks I hear the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us &s;aying, <HI>Simon Son of Jo|nas, love&s;t thou me?&mdash;Feed my Sheep.&mdash;Feed my Lambs.</HI> O how much have Mini&s;ters to do to <HI>watch</HI> for Souls as they that mu&s;t give Account? How &s;hould they watch every Opportunity to commend
<PB N="11" REF="010146_0008_0F7D1CB6CE39A1D0">
their glorious LORD in all his Beauty, tran&s;cendant Beauty, Glory and Excellency; and become all Things to all Men, that by all Means they may gain &s;ome to Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>Moreover, it is the great Thing that Chri&s;t's Heart is upon. Our dear Lord and Ma&s;ter has his Heart upon this as the great Thing in which his Glory as Mediator and Head of the Church con&s;i&s;ts. O how was his Heart upon it, in the Days of Eternity; when he was daily his Father's Delight, and was rejoicing always before him? Then he rejoiced in the habitable Part of his Earth, and his Delights were with the Sons of Men. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. 8.30, 31.</NOTE> And &s;urely his Heart mu&s;t be greatly upon it, when he came down, and taberna|cled in Fle&s;h, and dwelt among us. When he humbled him&s;elf in &s;uch an amazing Manner in his Birth, Life and Death for our Sakes. Submitted to all Ignominy and Sorrow: was a <HI>Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief.</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 53, 3.</NOTE> He bore the Malice of wick|ed Men and Devils; and &s;uffered the Hidings of his Father's Face. <HI>Was &s;tricken, Smitten of God, and afflicted; was wounded for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and brui&s;ed for our Iniquities. The Cha&s;ti&s;ement of our Peace was laid vpon him, that by his Stripes we might be healed.</HI> And O how was his Heart upon e&s;pou&s;ing us to him&s;elf, when <HI>for the Joy that was &s;et before him, he endured the Cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the Shame</HI>; and was &s;o <HI>&s;traitned till it was accompli&s;hed?</HI></P>
<P>And when we con&s;ider him as an Interce&s;&s;or, con&s;ider him in all his Offices; in all the indearing Characters in the ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel; and in all the Offers, Pains and Care of it in &s;ending his Amba&s;&s;a|dors to preach <HI>Peace by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and pray us in his Stead to be reconciled to God,</HI> mu&s;t we not be con&s;trained to &s;ay that his Heart was upon e&s;pou&s;ing Souls to him&s;elf; and of bringing many Sons and Daughters unto Glory? and if this be the Ca&s;e, how evidently does it appear to be the great Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s of Mini&s;ters, the very End and De&s;ign of their Office to win Souls to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Furthermore, as it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible that even Souls &s;hould be &s;aved any other Way, than, by a My&s;tical, and vital Union with the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; &s;o the very Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Mini&s;ters mu&s;t be about it. Indeed there is no other Way of Salvation for
<PB N="12" REF="010146_0009_0F7D1CB79062EE58">
Sinners, but by the only Redeemer; and no other Way of being &s;aved by him, but by Faith in him, which Faith is the very Act of the Soul whereby it receives him as both Lord and Chri&s;t, or, as he is repre&s;ented and offered to us in the Go&s;pel. And thus we become intere&s;ted in his Merits. As the Bride becomes inte|re&s;ted in her Hu&s;band's E&s;tate and Priviledges by Marriage, &s;o the believing Soul becomes, intru&s;ted in the Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Grace of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t by Marriage with him. Faith brings the Soul into a Union to Chri&s;t, and to a Participati|on in his E&s;tate, if I may &s;o &s;ay, and thus it is that we are ju&s;tified by Faith alone; and that <HI>by him, all that believe, are ju&s;tified from all Things, from which they could not be ju&s;tified, by the Law of Mo&s;es. Where is boa&s;ting then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of Works? Nay; but by the Law of Faith.</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 3.27.</NOTE> Therefore <HI>let him that glorieth, glory</HI> only <HI>in the Lord.</HI> And let Mini&s;ters be careful to preach Righteou&s;ne&s;s by Faith, without the Deads of the Law; yet be con&s;tant in affirming, that they which have believed in God be careful to maintain good Works; yea and that who&s;oever would find the Mercy of God, mu&s;t &s;eek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near.</P>
<P>I proceed to the third Thing propo&s;ed,</P>
<P N="3">3. To &s;hew that it &s;hould be the earne&s;t De&s;ire and Endeavour of the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, to e&s;pou&s;e Souls to him. And if it is their Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s, and a Work of &s;o great Importance, they ought to go about it with their Hearts engaged in it, with very ardent De&s;ires that it might be accompli&s;hed, and &s;hould u&s;e their utmo&s;t Endeavours to promote it, that their great Ma&s;ters Intere&s;t may be advanced. Here,</P>
<P N="1">1. It &s;hould be their <HI>earne&s;t, fervent De&s;ire.</HI> Mini&s;ters &s;hould not take the Over&s;ight of the Flock of Chri&s;t by Con&s;traint, but willingly; not for filthy Lucre, but with a ready Mind, ready to lay down their Lives in the glorious Cau&s;e, to lay down their Lives for the Brethren. The Love of Chri&s;t and Souls &s;hould con&s;train them; and not the Love of this vain, tran&s;itory World. O how &s;hould the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t <HI>travail in Birth</HI> for their dear People
<PB N="13" REF="010146_0010_0F7D1CB81D33D868">
with St. Paul, <HI>'till Chri&s;t be formed in them</HI>? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. 4.19.</NOTE> Such &s;hould be their De&s;ires, earne&s;t, painful De&s;ires for the Conver&s;ion of Sin|ners to God, and very e&s;pecially of tho&s;e committed to their more immediate Care. If they are the Friends of the Bridegroom, (as indeed they &s;hould be) how greatly &s;hould they de&s;ire to have the Weeding furni&s;hed with Gue&s;ts: And the King of Zion crowned in the Day of his E&s;pou&s;als, the Day of the Gladne&s;s of his Heart. Surely, not to de&s;ire it a above every worldly Advantage, above their Honor, or Ea&s;e, or any Thing &s;ecular, mu&s;t be highly criminal in the Sight of God, who has &s;ent them out upon &s;uch Bu&s;ine&s;s. <HI>Jeru&s;alem's Peace</HI> &s;hould be preferred <HI>above their chief Joy.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 137.6.</NOTE></P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. They &s;hould <HI>earne&s;tly endeavour</HI> to bring about the ble&s;&s;ed Match between Chri&s;t and Souls.</P>
<P>What indefatigable Pains &s;hould the Mini&s;ters of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us take, to e&s;pou&s;e Souls to him in the Go&s;pel Covenant? Here let me &s;ay,</P>
<P>Much Pains &s;hould be taken in the Study, that beaten Oil may be brought into the Sanctuary. Wi&s;e Preachers will give <HI>good Heed, &s;eek out, and &s;et in Order</HI> their Di&s;cour&s;es: they will <HI>&s;eek to find out acceptable Words, even Words of Truth.</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. 12.9, 10,</NOTE> They &s;hould <HI>give them&s;elves to Reading, Meditation and Prayer.</HI> Mini&s;ters &s;hould be praying Men. <HI>We will give our&s;elves continually to Prayer, and to the Mini&s;try of the Word,</HI> &s;ay the APOSTLES.

Things, with what Gravity and Decency, Solemnity and Reverence &s;hould they be clothed? What a holy Zeal and heavenly Fervor &s;hould they put on; and, in the Strength of the Lord declare all his Works, declare all the Council of God? And give to every one his Portion in due Sea&s;on?</P>
<P>They &s;hould preach the Law, for by it is the Knowledge of Sin; by it are the carele&s;s and carnal, the vicious and profligate, and every unregenerate Sinner to be awakned, that they may flee from the Wrath to come. And they &s;hould preach the Go&s;pel, &s;ound the <HI>Jubilee</HI> Trumpet, proclaiming Liberty for the <HI>in&s;olvant Debter,</HI> the poor mi&s;erable Bond Slave to go out free, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the rich Inheritance among the Saints in Light.

And, O how &s;weet and joyful, to bring one Gue&s;t to the Wedding!</P>
<P>Again how faithful &s;hould they be in Admini&s;tring the Seals of Gods gracious Covenant, to his vi&s;ible People? And al&s;o in warn|ing and admoni&s;hing the ignorant and &s;candalous; and in di&s;pen&s;|ing the Di&s;cipline of Chri&s;t's Hou&s;e according to his Mind?</P>

<P>How <HI>winning</HI> &s;hould Mini&s;ters be in their Preaching, Conver&s;ati|on and Behaviour? How wi&s;e and prudent? How kind and ten|der, courteous and affable, apt to teach, ever ready to advi&s;e and coun&s;el; to remove Doubts and Difficulties, direct under Trials and Temptations? to &s;trengrhen the weak, encourage the faint and timorous, comfort the &s;orrowful di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tian, and alarm the &s;ecure Sinner, as well as detect the clo&s;e Hypocrite?

Would to God that all might <HI>be &s;aved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth</HI> as it is Je&s;us!</P>
<P>Thus having briefly &s;poken to the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition, I proceed to the other, viz.</P>
<P N="2">II. Tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who are made the happy In&s;truments of e&s;pou&s;ing Souls to Chri&s;t &s;hall have the un&s;peakable Satisfaction, the great Honor, Joy and comfort of pre&s;enting them as a cha&s;t Virgin to him.</P>
<P>Indeed every true and faithfull Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t &s;hall be glori|ous in the Eyes of the LORD, tho' I&s;rael be not gathered; and great &s;hall be their Reward in Heaven. God will reward them, not &s;o much according to their Succe&s;s, as according to their Faith|fulne&s;s. Yet, certainly <HI>they that be wi&s;e &s;hall &s;hine as the Brightne&s;s of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the Stars for ever and ever.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dan. 12.3.</NOTE> It is not only po&s;&s;ible, but probable that they will have &s;ome additional Honors and Comforts, &s;ome Joys which may exceed; Joys in their &s;piritual Children, whom they have begotton through the Go&s;pel. But here let me ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. That &s;ome Mini&s;ters have been, are, and doubtle&s;s will be, the happy In&s;truments of e&s;pou&s;ing Souls to Chri&s;t. God is plea&s;ed graciou&s;ly to ble&s;s their Labors for the Conviction and Conver&s;ion of Sinners. It is not in them, let them labor ever &s;o faithfully, but of God alone that &s;heweh Mercy. Paul him&s;elf may plant, and Apol|los water in vain, except God giveth the Increa&s;e. Without the Father draws, no Man can come to Chri&s;t; for the carnal Mind is Enmity again&s;t God, the will &s;et in Oppo&s;ition again&s;t him. There mu&s;t, therefore, be the Day of God's Power to bring the Sinner to a Go&s;pel Submi&s;&s;ion. And that Chri&s;t's faithful Mini|&s;ters have good Ground to expect. A mo&s;t wonderful Promi&s;e our dear Lord and Ma&s;ter has left for them, <HI>LO, I am with you al|ways, even to the End of the</HI> World. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mat. 28.20.</NOTE> And as God has been plea&s;|ed to make &s;uch abundant Provi&s;ion in the Go&s;pel, and &s;o many
<PB N="16" REF="010146_0013_0F7D1CBD334B9B68">
precious Promi&s;es of the Spirit to be poured forth, as Floods, and as Waters upon the dry Ground, we may well look for glorious Days of Reformation; and therefore that God will make &s;ome, at lea&s;t, of his faithful Mininers happy In&s;truments of bringing ma|ny Sons and Daughters unto Glory.</P>
<P>It is &s;o commonly, if not always, that where Chri&s;t &s;ends his Mini&s;ters, he has cho&s;en Ve&s;&s;els to be called in, and brought Home to him&s;elf: and wherever it is &s;o, he will undoubtedly ble&s;s their Labors for gathering in his Harve&s;t. It has plea&s;ed God, <HI>by the Fooli&s;hne&s;s of preaching</HI> (tho' not by fooli&s;h Preaching) <HI>to &s;ave them that believe.</HI> He is indeed all in all, and the In&s;trument nothing but an In&s;trument, and no more of an In&s;trument than he is plea&s;|ed to make it: but ble&s;&s;ed be his Name, he is many times plea&s;ed to make his Mini&s;ters wonderful In&s;truments of a glorious Reforma|tion. What Wonders were done by the preaching of the Apo&s;tles and Mini&s;ters, in the fir&s;t Ages of Chri&s;tianity? And what great Things have been done many times &s;ince, when the Go&s;pel has been preached in it's Power and Purity? What was done by the In&s;trumentality of Luther, Calvin and others about 250 years ago. A Reformation which has not been lo&s;t to this Day. And how has God &s;ucceeded the Labors of &s;ome of his Mini&s;ters in our Day, for the building up of his Kingdom and Intere&s;t among us? True, we have great Rea&s;on to mourn many &s;orrowful Things, as the Prevalence of Errors and Divi&s;ions, and the awful Profanity and Wickedne&s;s of Multitudes in the Land; and that after, yea in the Mid&s;t of great Judgments and Mercies, Neverthele&s;s there are a goodly Number, who evidence, by their Virgin Purity and Cha&s;ti|ty, that they are e&s;pou&s;ed to one Hu&s;band, even Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. Such mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t as are in&s;trumental of e&s;pou&s;ing Souls to him <HI>&s;hall pre&s;ent them to him as a cha&s;te Virgin.</HI></P>
<P>Here,</P>
<P N="1">1. I would &s;peak of the Time when they &s;hall pre&s;ent them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Shew <HI>how</HI> they &s;hall pre&s;ent them to Chri&s;t</P>
<P N="1">1. I am to &s;peak of the Time when the faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t &s;hall pre&s;ent believing Souls to him.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="010146_0014_0F7D1CBDD1BD4668">And it may be &s;aid that they are pre&s;enting them in their daily Prayers, and in the Admini&s;tration of the holy Ordinances of the Go&s;pel. But then, the Time referred to is very likely the great and la&s;t Day, the Day of Judgment. Then &s;hall they come, and appear before their LORD and Ma&s;ter to give Account of their Steward&s;hip, and then &s;hall they &s;ay, <HI>Here Lord am I, and the Children which thou ha&s;t given me.</HI> I have delivered to them thy Word; And thro' thy Grace, they have received it, believed in thy Name, and obeyed thy Will. They have kept thy Word. And now LORD, let them be glorified with thee according to thy mo&s;t gracious Promi&s;e. This will undoubtedly be the Time, when, in a very e&s;pecial Manner, they &s;hall pre&s;ent them before the LORD JESUS CHRIST; and then &s;hall they be led in to the King in Raiment of Needle Work, in the pure and fine Linen which is the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Saints.</P>
<P N="2">2. I am to &s;hew How the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t &s;hall pre&s;ent tho&s;e whom they have e&s;pou&s;ed to him, and that is <HI>as a cha&s;te Virgin.</HI> So they &s;hall pre&s;ent them <HI>pure and holy</HI>; for they &s;hall be perfectly holy, being made free from all Sin: yea, they &s;hall be really and po&s;itively holy, being wa&s;hed, ju&s;tified and &s;anctified in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and by the Spirit of our God. The holy Image of the ble&s;&s;ed God is in &s;tamped, and compleated upon them; and they are transformed by the renewing of their Minds by the Holy Gho&s;t. And how great is this Purity and Holine&s;s? 'Tis the Price of Chri&s;t's Blood, and the Labor and Operation of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, who creates the Soul anew, and forms it after the divine Image, <HI>in Knowledge, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s.</HI> Not only are they <HI>Partakers of the divine Nature,</HI> but their whole Nature and Temper is divine and heavenly. All the Graces of the Spirit are grown up to Perfection, and Sanctification is compleated; &s;o there is no Alloy, no Remainders of Corruption, but a perfect Soundne&s;s in every Part.</P>
<P>They &s;hall al&s;o pre&s;ent them <HI>free and intire</HI> Believers e&s;pou&s;ed to Chri&s;t, are e&s;pou&s;ed to him <HI>only,</HI> being divorced from all other former Lords, who had Dominion over them. They were once as ba&s;e, vile Harlots, with their Affections &s;et upon many Lovers;
<PB N="18" REF="010146_0015_0F7D1CBE7B6B1EE0">
but the Wonders of divine Grace have made them as a cha&s;te Vir|gin, &s;potle&s;s, innocent, pure and clean. They are married to Chri&s;t, and kept pure and intire: they are brought to be wholly for Chri&s;t, and for no other. Their Love is pure Virgin Love, undivided &s;ound and unblemi&s;hed. And they are now, pre|&s;ented to Chri&s;t, <HI>without Spot or Wrinkle, or any &s;uch Thing.</HI> The&s;e are the wi&s;e Virgins, who &s;hall go with the Bridegroom, when he &s;hall come, into the Marriage Chamber, and be for ever with the LORD. Such &s;hall the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t pre&s;ent unto him, and in &s;uch a Condition &s;hall they pre&s;ent them at that great Day. Suffer me once more to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="3">3. With what great Satisfaction the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t &s;hall pre|&s;ent the&s;e cha&s;te Virgins to him. The APOSTLE &s;peaks, in our Text, as if it was his great De&s;ire that he might &s;o pre&s;ent the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Church to Chri&s;t. He was therefore, jealous over them with a godly Jealou&s;ly, lea&s;t he &s;hould be di&s;appointed of pre&s;enting them in this Manner. And &s;urely, if it was a Matter of no great Importance; if it would be no great Satisfaction, Joy or Comfort to him, he would not be &s;o concerned about it. We mu&s;t there|fore conclude that the true and faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, will have abundant Satisfaction, when they come before their LORD and Ma&s;ter, with a <HI>Here</HI> LORD <HI>am I, and the Children which thou ha&s;t graciou&s;ly given thy Servant.</HI> They mu&s;t have great Satisfaction, Joy and Comfort in the Glory and Honor of their dear and ble&s;&s;ed LORD, in &s;o many Seals of their Mini&s;try; &s;o many joined to him in the Covenant of Grace, e&s;pou&s;ed to him, as a cha&s;te Virgin to one Hu&s;band. They mu&s;t have their Joy fulfilled, when they be|hold them received into the Pre&s;ence of their glorious LORD, <HI>to behold his Glory,</HI> and partake of the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Marriage Fea&s;t. And will it be no Honor, Joy or Comfort, to have &s;o many Stars in their Crown? Verily, <HI>they are their Joy and Crown,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phil. 4.1.</NOTE> e&s;pecially <HI>in the Day of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>How ble&s;&s;ed will the true Mini&s;ters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t be at that great Day, who will then have not only their own Salvation to re|joice in, but the Salvation of &s;o many precious Souls, thro' their
<PB N="19" REF="010146_0016_0F7D1CBF3427B710">
In&s;trumentality? And now to look back upon all their Labors and Sufferings in the glorious Cau&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us; and all the Dangers and Difficulties through which they, by the Help of di|vine Grace, have led the Flock of Chri&s;t, mu&s;t be refre&s;hing and comforting. And if any &s;hall have an Additional Happine&s;s they will: If any &s;hall have a larger and weightier Crown of Life and Glory &s;uch Mini&s;ters will have. And then he that &s;ow|ed, and they that reap, &s;hall rejoice together. And as a Father has a peculiar Joy in his Children, &s;o the&s;e Fathers in Chri&s;t will have a peculiar and &s;pecial Joy in their &s;piritual Children. And very likely good Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, will have &s;omething &s;pecial to do, in leading, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Church of God, in Heaven, to all Eternity; may go before in the heavenly Wor&s;hip and Services. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The four Bea&s;ts, or rather the four living Creatures in the Rev. IV. &s;uppo&s;ed to intend, or to be Repre&s;entatives of, the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, are repre&s;ented V. 6. as <HI>full of Eyes before and behind</HI>; and in V. 8. <HI>full of Eyes within,</HI> which may denote their exqui&s;ite Knowledge and Di&s;cerning in divine Things; that they look, not only within, to them&s;elves and for them&s;elves, but <HI>before and behind</HI> them, even to all that are about them. And V. 9, 10. We read that <HI>when tho&s;e</HI> living Creatures <HI>give Glory and Honor, and Thanks to him that &s;at on the Throne, who liveth for ever and ever, the Four and Twenty Elders,</HI> which are &s;uppo&s;ed to repre&s;ent the Church, <HI>fall down before him that &s;at upon the Throne, and wor&s;hip him that liveth for ever and ever,</HI> &amp;c. Thus <HI>the four living Creatures,</HI> the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, lead the <HI>Four and Twenty Elders,</HI> the Church, in the heavenly Wor&s;hip.</NOTE> Indeed, we, poor &s;hort &s;ighted Creatures can know, in this our imperfect State, but very little of tho&s;e Things: God has re&s;erved the Di&s;covery of them, chiefly for that ble&s;&s;ed Period before us; but doubtle&s;s the Satisfaction of the Friends of the Bridegroom, at that Day, will be great, and their Joy will be full, to &s;ee the Spou&s;e of Chri&s;t brought Home, thro' &s;o many Tribulations; and led in to the King, who <HI>will wipe away all Tears from her Eyes, and lead her to living Fountains of Water.</HI></P>

That the LORD JESUS CHRIT, the eternal Son of God, &s;hould take &s;uch as we are, even his wor&s;t Ene|mies, into &s;o near a Relation to him&s;elf, is amazing Grace, marvel|lous Love, Love beyond all Expre&s;&s;ion, and Conde&s;cention, with|out a Parallel.

For the highe&s;t &s;overeign Monarch among the Kings of the Earth, to &s;toop to marry the vile&s;t Harlot among his wor&s;t Enemies, his open, and avowed Enemies, would look like Conde|&s;cention, and may be &s;ome faint Shadow of this; but really there would then be an infinite Di&s;proportion; for it would be but one of his Fellow Worms; and their Natures are the &s;ame. But for the God of Nature, the Creator of the Univer&s;e, by whom all Things do con&s;i&s;t, to veail his Divinity in Humanity, and freely &s;ubmit to all tho&s;e cruel Sufferings which our dear Redeemer did; and then take &s;uch vile Creatures, his wor&s;t Enemies, and the Bond Slaves of the Devil into his Bo&s;om, is truly a&s;toni&s;hing, and marvelous.

Even &s;ome of the mo&s;t faithful Mini|&s;ters of Chri&s;t are illy treated, and their Coun&s;el de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected by tho&s;e whom they would fain e&s;pou&s;e to the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us. But let &s;uch know that the Time is coming when they &s;hall know that there has been a Prophet among them. It will be very terrible by and by for &s;uch as receive not the Te&s;timony of the Go&s;pel Mini|&s;ters. Chri&s;t will take all that is &s;aid and done again&s;t them, as &s;aid and done again&s;t him&s;elf. Therefore let People beware how they conduct towards Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters, and &s;ee that they e&s;teem highly of their Office, and be very thankful for them. They &s;hould e&s;teem them great Ble&s;&s;ings, and the riche&s;t Trea&s;ures they
<PB N="23" REF="010146_0020_0F7D1CC263FAA1E0">
po&s;&s;e&s;s, next to &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings. And they &s;hould be much in Prayer for them, love and honor them as their Lord's Amba&s;&s;adors: hearken to the Word they preach in the Name of the Lord, and the private Coun&s;els and In&s;tructions they give them, and do as the noble <HI>Bereans,</HI> &s;earch the Scriptures and &s;ee whether they &s;peak according to that unerring Rule, or not.</P>
<P N="3">III. Should it be the earne&s;t, fervent De&s;ire and Endeavor of Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters to e&s;pou&s;e Souls to him? Hence,</P>
<P N="1">1. Mini&s;ters &s;hould be holy and good Men.</P>
<P>If &s;uch be their Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s, and they are to go forward in it with fervent and earne&s;t, hearty De&s;ires for the Glory of God in the Salvation of Souls, they had need to be godly and gracious, holy and righteous Men: For what De&s;ires can a wicked Man have for the Glory of God, the Intere&s;t of the great Redeemer and the Good of precious Souls? True, he may have many De&s;ires from &s;elfi&s;h Views, or Ends. But will &s;uch an one <HI>travail in Birth</HI> like the Apo&s;tle, <HI>till Chri&s;t be formed in his People?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. 4.19.</NOTE> Will he wre&s;tle and plead as Jacob and Mo&s;es till he obtains the Ble&s;&s;ing? Can he out of Love to Chri&s;t, with Peter, feed Chri&s;t's Sheep and Lambs? Rather will he not regard the Fleece more than the Flock? And in&s;tead of preaching Chri&s;t Je&s;us the LORD, will he not preach him&s;elf? O how great Danger, that while the blind lead the blind they will both fall into the Ditch? Indeed &s;uch an one may preach good Truths, and even to Edification, but all the while he is a Stranger to tho&s;e Truths and knows them not in their Spirituality and Glory. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. Mini&s;ters greatly need the Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t, and the A&s;&s;i&s;|tances of his Spirit with them. If, as we have heard, &s;uch is to be their Labor, and Endeavour for the Conver&s;ion and Salvation of Sinners, they really need the Pre&s;ence of Je&s;us Chri&s;t with them, even his promi&s;ed Pre&s;ence; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. 28.30.</NOTE> and the Holy Gho&s;t quickning, in|lightning, &s;anctifying and comforting them. This will wonderful|ly &s;trengthen and help him in his great and difficult Work. How will his Soul be full of heavenly Matter, and his <HI>Tongue</HI> as <HI>the Pen of a ready Writer,</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 15.6.</NOTE> and the holy Fire of Love and Zeal, burn
<PB N="24" REF="010146_0021_0F7D1CC2E22D5420">
<HI>Seraph</HI> like in the Pre&s;ence of the eternal Jehovah? Then will he <HI>be &s;trong in Grace that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 2, 1.</NOTE> and with heroic Courage and Fortitude engage in the Work of the Lord his God, and plead his Cau&s;e again&s;t the mighty. He will labor, and not faint; and im|prove all his Time and Talents for the Intere&s;t of the great Re|deemer, and the Good of Souls. Therefore, what Rea&s;on have they to be humbled to the Du&s;t, and mourn the Want of the di|vine Pre&s;ence? And how earne&s;tly &s;hould they &s;eek it; and not allow them&s;elves to live ea&s;y and contented without it? For Mini|&s;ters to be cold and dead, lifele&s;s and &s;lothful is a greater Sin than for a private Chri&s;tian, a more heinous Sin again&s;t their Lord and Ma&s;ter, and a great Injury to the Intere&s;t of Souls. O that our Hearts and Lips were ever <HI>touched</HI> as <HI>with a live Coal from the Altar.</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">6 I&s;a. 6, 7.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. How few Mini&s;ters do their Duty as they ought? How great Rea&s;on have they to be humbled, and a&s;hamed before the Lord, and cry with the Prophet <HI>My Leanne&s;s, my Leanne&s;s</HI>! And how &s;hould they look to the great Atonement for them&s;elves as well as the People! Ble&s;&s;ed be God, there is enough in our great High-Prie&s;t for the Prie&s;thood, as well as the Congregation. Were it not &s;o, we could not hold up our Faces before the LORD. Here is our Refuge. But O let us, who are Mini&s;ters, bewail our Bar|renne&s;s and Unprofitablene&s;s, look over our Mini&s;try, and view our &s;hort comings, which may be &s;een in every Part of our Mini&s;try; and let us fly to the Blood of the Covenant with an <HI>O God deliver me from Blood Guiltine&s;s.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 51.14.</NOTE> And would to God that we, and every Mini&s;ter, might be more concerned to be found faithful! A very &s;ad Account the unfaithful Mini&s;ter will have to give up at la&s;t. And in&s;tead of a goodly Number of precious Souls, e&s;pou&s;ed, through his In&s;trumentality, <HI>to one Hu&s;band, to pre&s;ent, as a cha&s;te Virgin to Chri&s;t,</HI> he &s;tands with a gha&s;tly Number, who&s;e Blood is required at his Hands. Tremble, my Soul, at the awful Thought! Blow the Trumpet in Zion, and warn the wicked of his Ways!</P>
<P N="4">IV. Shall tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who are in&s;trumental of e&s;pou&s;ing Souls to Chri&s;t, finally have the un&s;peakable Joy and Satisfaction of pre|&s;enting
<PB N="25" REF="010146_0022_0F7D1CC3A991E050">
them, at la&s;t, unto him? How &s;hould this <HI>animate</HI> and <HI>&s;up|port</HI> every Mini&s;ter in his great and difficult Work?</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters have a very great and difficulty Work, a weighty Work that lies heavy upon their Souls. A very great and difficult Thing it is to bring Souls to e&s;pou&s;e the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Many make light of the Invitation, and will not come to the Wedding. Mini&s;ters have various Tempers and Con&s;titutions to deal with; a Flood of Errors and Corruptions to with&s;tand, and guard again&s;t: Temptations to remove by all po&s;&s;ible proper Means. Hard Hearts, &s;tupied Con&s;ciences; worldly, carnal, loo&s;e, profane and profligate Sinners to deal with; and what not? for the Children of apo&s;tate <HI>Adam</HI> have run into thou&s;ands of Di&s;orders, and wild Mazes of Sin and Error, out of which they mu&s;t be brought, or they will inevi|tably peri&s;h. And there is a Legion, yea Legions of Devils, ever in bu&s;y Employ to prevent the Succe&s;s of the Go&s;pel. Be&s;ides, the good Mini&s;ter has a bad Heart of his own to grapple with, which renders his Work the more difficult. And how many more Dif|ficulties has every true Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? How many Di&s;|courgements, and Heart-breaking Con&s;iderations? yet, ble&s;&s;ed be God, he has an over ballance for them all. In due Time he &s;hall reap if he faint not. <HI>He that goeth forth, and weepeth, bearing pre|cious Seed, &s;hall doubtle&s;s come again with Rejoicing, bringing his Sheaves with him</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 126, 6,</NOTE>. The thought of winning Souls to Chri&s;t, and of pre&s;enting them at la&s;t, as a cha&s;te Virgin to him, affords a won|derful Support and Comfort under every Di&s;couragement. To be the happy In&s;trument of the Conver&s;ion of one Soul is a great Thing: to be the In&s;trument of Good to one of the lea&s;t of all Chri&s;t's Hou&s;hold, is a Matter of &s;o much Importance, that a Mini|&s;ter's Labor cannot be &s;aid to be in vain; no, but eternal Honor will redound to God, and Good to that Soul, yea, and a glorious Reward too to the good Mini&s;ter him&s;elf. Let them therefore, be animated in their Work, and take Comfort in it. It is a good Work; a glorious Work; the Work of the Lord. Let them labor and not faint; pre&s;s forward, and <HI>look to Je&s;us</HI> their Lord and Ma&s;|ter, <HI>Je&s;us the Author and Fini&s;her of our Faith</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 12.2.</NOTE>, and <HI>endure as &s;eeing

<P>And now as I am going to take the Care of one of Chri&s;t's little Flocks in the Wilderne&s;s, what &s;hall I &s;ay to my&s;elf upon &s;o &s;olemn an Occa&s;ion? Sen&s;ible, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure of my great In&s;ufficiency <HI>for the&s;e Things,</HI> I would humbly bow my Neck to Chri&s;t's Yoke, depending upon his abundant Grace to be &s;ufficient for me in the great and important Work; and would engage to per&s;evere in it, by his Help, <HI>without which,</HI> I &s;ee, <HI>I can do Nothing.</HI></P>
<P>In my early Days I freely gave up my&s;elf to the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, with a fervent De&s;ire to &s;erve him in the Work of the glorious Go&s;pel. The ardent De&s;ire of e&s;pou&s;ing Souls to Chri&s;t, was the prevailing Motive with me, to devote my&s;elf to &s;tudy under many Di&s;advantages, and cau&s;ed me to per&s;evere until I entered upon the Work. And ble&s;&s;ed be God who has in any Mea&s;ure, owned my worthle&s;s Endeavours for the good of Souls.</P>
<P>Indeed it has plea&s;ed a holy, righteous and &s;overeign God, in his all wi&s;e and all governing Providence to call me to leave that dear People in <HI>Norwich,</HI> to which I lately &s;tood in the pa&s;toral Relation, to the great Grief of us both. Yet thro' Grace, I e&s;teem <HI>this</HI> with all my Sorrows but my <HI>light Afflictions,</HI> and <HI>not worthy to be com|pared with the Glory to be revealed.</HI></P>
<P>And as I am now called to leave my Friends, to go a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance into the Wilderne&s;s, to an infant Plantation, where the Go&s;pel is &s;o greatly needed, I chearfully comply, hoping in God's own Time, to &s;ee the Wilderne&s;s and the De&s;art to rejoice, and blo&s;&s;om as the Ro&s;e, &s;o that <HI>the Glory of Lebanon, the Excellency of Carmel and Sharon &s;hall be given to it&punc; that they &s;hall &s;ee the Glory of the Lord, and the Excellency of our God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 35, 1, 2. See the re&s;t of the Chapter.</NOTE>. If thro' the abundant Grace of God, I may be the happy, tho' unworthy In&s;trument of e&s;pou&s;ing Souls to Chri&s;t, and may at la&s;t, pre&s;ent them as a cha&s;te Virgin to him, it will be the Sum of all my De&s;ires. To this End I earne&s;tly a&s;k an Intere&s;t in all your Prayers, and humbly commend my&s;elf to the Grace of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us my Lord.</P>
<P>And now my Reverend Fathers and Brethren, may I, your mo&s;t
