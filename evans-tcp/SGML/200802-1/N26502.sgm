<P>THE ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and improvements in anatomy, is an enquiry &s;o highly de|&s;irable, and e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite for every &s;tudent in the &s;cience, that the following hi&s;tory, collected from different authori|ties, will, I pre&s;ume, &s;ufficiently recom|mend it&s;elf to the anatomi&s;t, philo&s;o|pher, phy&s;ician, and every per&s;on who e&s;teems &s;cientific pur&s;uits de&s;erving a part of their applications.</P>

<P>However, I pre&s;ume to offer an ar|rangement of authors and profe&s;&s;ors in the periods in which they lived and flouri&s;hed, together with their di&s;cove|ries and improvements, and eulogiums, as given by the mo&s;t celebrated modern profe&s;&s;ors.</P>

<HEAD>THE Hi&s;tory of Anatomy.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t medical man known to have written on Anatomy was Hippocrates, though before his time there is great rea&s;on to believe that this &s;ubject was in &s;ome degree under&s;tood. From the natural horror which attends medling with human dead bodies, it is probable that the fir&s;t enquiries were made on the brute creation.</P>
<P>The de&s;criptions of parts, given by early anatomi&s;ts, evidently &s;hew this; and when the anatomi&s;t had conquered his own prejudices he &s;till would have the prejudices of the people to encounter, which in mo&s;t countries have been &s;o great as to endanger the life of him who at|tempts it; this mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily impede the pro|gre&s;s of the &s;cience.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t knowledge on this &s;ubject was probably derived from the religious ceremony of performing &s;acrifices: in this ceremony particular parts were &s;eperated for particular purpo&s;es, by which the &s;acrificer mu&s;t have ac|quired &s;ome knowledge of the interior parts of animals.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="035232_0004_10017F275327EA58">
The &s;uper&s;titious maxim of progno&s;ticating events by the appearances of the vi&s;cera, would contribute further to the acqui&s;ition of this knowledge.</P>
<P>The method of the Egyptians of embalm|ing bodies, as mentioned by Jo&s;ephus, mu&s;t have cau&s;ed the embalmers to have acquired &s;ome knowledge of the human &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Some pa&s;&s;ages in HOMER, who lived one thou&s;and years before Chri&s;t&punc; &s;erve to &s;hew he had &s;ome knowledge of this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Some philo&s;ophers, about the time of Hip|pocrates, appear to have been very much em|ployed in enquiring into the &s;tructure of ani|mals as a part of natural Philo&s;ophy; of the&s;e Democrates was particularly eminent. This philo&s;opher lived at Abdera, four hundred and &s;eventy years before Chri&s;t, AEtatis 109. He was &s;uppo&s;ed by his countrymen to be mad, who de&s;ired Hippocrates to vi&s;it him that he might be cured.</P>
<P>When Hippocrates fir&s;t &s;aw him, he was di&s;&s;ecting an animal to di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> over the &s;eat of the bile, and from the conver&s;ation which pa&s;&s;ed between them, Hippocrates pronounced him to be the wi&s;e&s;t man living.</P>
<P>Hippocrates appears to have been the fir&s;t who &s;eperated medicine from philo&s;ophy, and made the practice of it a di&s;tinct profe&s;&s;ion. He has pai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">d out to po&s;terity the mo&s;t certain means of practi&s;ing the art &s;ucce&s;sfully, by ac|quiring
<PB N="5" REF="035232_0005_10017F2989DBBE20">
a knowledge of the &s;tructure, &s;ituation, and al&s;o the u&s;e of the various parts which com|po&s;e the human body. The hi&s;tory which he has written proves him to be a man of extraor|dinary accuracy in his ob&s;ervations. His works have been ju&s;tly admired in all ages, and accord|ing to many of his enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirers, they contain all the medical knowledge that has been &s;ince publi&s;hed. They al&s;o a&s;&s;ert that the circulation of the blood, and other di&s;coveries claimed by different anatomi&s;ts, are to be found in his works&mdash;If, however, we impartially ex|amine his opinions on the functions of parts, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that he was very er|roneous, and that his anatomical de&s;criptions are very defective. To judge the better of this, I will afford a conci&s;e view of his opinions on &s;everal parts, viz.&mdash;</P>
<P>First&mdash;That the heart was the origin of the blood and phlegm.</P>
<P>Secondly.&mdash;That the urine came from the &s;pleen, and the bile from the liver.</P>
<P>Thirdly.&mdash;That the liver was the origin and root of the veins, as the heart is of the arteries.</P>
<P>Fourthly.&mdash;That the veins conveyed the blood to the different parts of the body, which motion he compares to the ebbing and flowing of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Fifthly.&mdash;That the arteries were the re&s;er|voirs of the &s;pirit, or air, and conformable to this idea he &s;peaks of the trachea as an artery,
<PB N="6" REF="035232_0006_10017F2BC5F43B20">
and accordingly called it <HI>A&s;pera Arteria,</HI> a name it &s;till retains.</P>
<P>He applies continually the name of vein to the arteries, and al&s;o to the nerves and ureters: the nerves, tendons and ligaments are &s;poken of as being the &s;ame. He &s;uppo&s;es the brain to be entirely glandular, and that it imbibed, like a &s;ponge, the &s;uperfluous water from the heart. He &s;ays that the brain is the &s;eat of prudence and of judgment: the &s;pinal marrow, he ob&s;erves, is continued from the brain, and that the term is improperly employed, as it is &s;urrounded with membranes which the mar|row in other bones is not. He &s;ays that the inte&s;tines are of a &s;pongy texture where they touch the urinal bladder, through which the urine pa&s;&s;es from the one to the other.&mdash;He ob&s;erves that the kidneys ought to be cla&s;&s;ed with the glands, that they have an attracting power of imbibing a part of the fluids which are drank, and that it is filtered into water, and pa&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the&s;e into the bladder by veins:&mdash;he conceived the ureters to be veins, and from ob&s;erving that they pa&s;&s;ed &s;o directly into the bladder, he might &s;uppo&s;e that they performed this office. In this works very little is &s;aid on the mu&s;cles, as he &s;uppo&s;ed that motion and &s;en&s;ation were performed by the arteries.</P>
<P>It is doubted by many whether he ever di&s;|&s;ected a human &s;ubject. <HI>Haller</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed that he had, from the de&s;cription he has given of the
<PB N="7" REF="035232_0007_100164CD35AF1290">
&s;ubclavius mu&s;cle; but this evidence is not alone &s;ufficiently convincing as that mu&s;cle ex|i&s;ts in the ape, an animal which was common|ly di&s;&s;ected at that time.</P>
<P>Hippocrates al&s;o tells us, as a great and mi|raculous event, "he once in his life had the op|portunity of &s;eeing a human &s;keleton."</P>
<P>This great man is &s;aid to have been a de&s;cend|ant of AE&s;culapius, he was born in the i&s;land of Cos, four hundred and &s;ixty years before Chri&s;t, and died at ninety years of age, but according to &s;ome, he lived to be one hundred and four.</P>
<P><HI>Plato</HI> followed the example of Pythagoras and Democrates, in teaching natural philo&s;o|phy, by treating of &s;everal parts of medicine, particularly the oeconomy of the human body, but on this &s;ubject his opinions are very erro|neous.</P>
<P>He was born at Athens, four hundred and twenty nine years before Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> preceptor of Alexander the Great, wrote a natural hi&s;tory of animals, which, (as Pliny relates) con&s;i&s;ted of fifty books, there being now only eleven extant. From the ana|tomy in that part of his works which remain, it is very evident he never had di&s;&s;ected the human &s;ubject.</P>
<P>He thought that the &s;kulls of men were join|ed by three sutures, and tho&s;e of women by one only: he counts eight ribs on each &s;ide. Galen &s;ays he fir&s;t named the aorta. He be|lieved that the nerves aro&s;e from the heart,
<PB N="8" REF="035232_0008_10017F2EA3A8AD68">
and that the heart was compo&s;ed of three cavi|ties, containing three kinds of blood. He was born three hundred and eighty-four years be|fore Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Diocles,</HI> a phy&s;ician of great reputation, who flouri&s;hed about one hundred and thirty years after Hippocrates, is &s;aid by Galen to have written a book of anatomy, in which the order of di&s;&s;ection is de&s;cribed for the purpo&s;e of de|monstrating the different parts of the body.</P>
<P><HI>Praxagoras</HI> of Cos, who&s;e works are al&s;o lo&s;t, is mentioned by Galen as an excellent anato|mi&s;t. He fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed the arteries from the veins, which he de&s;cribes as being the beat|ing ve&s;&s;els, and containing only air or &s;pirit; he &s;uppo&s;ed that the arteries changed into nerves from the diminution of their cavities towards their extremities.</P>
<P>The <HI>Alexandrian School,</HI> during the reigns of the Ptolemies who &s;ucceeded Alexander the Great, we find the &s;tudy of anatomy flouri&s;hed in Egypt. The &s;econd king of this name found|ed an academy at Alexandria, in which there was a library &s;aid to contain two hundred thou&s;and volumes. Some a&s;&s;ert a number equal to double the above. In this &s;chool anatomy was particularly encouraged, all the executed criminals being &s;ent there for di&s;&s;ection.</P>
<P>From the time of Hippocrates to the found|ing of this &s;chool, which was more than two hundred years, phy&s;icians had made very little
<PB N="9" REF="035232_0009_10017F3030C13B50">
progre&s;s in anatomy, and it &s;eems very proba|ble that little, if any enquiry had been made, into the &s;tructure of the human body, and the brute creation was alone di&s;&s;ected.</P>
<P>Galen has given an account of the Alexan|drian anatomi&s;ts, two of which more particu|larly de&s;erve our attention, viz. <HI>Era&s;i&s;tratus</HI> and <HI>Herophilus.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Era&s;i&s;tratus</HI> di&s;covered the lacteals in the me|&s;entary of a goat; he explained the principal u&s;e of the brain and nerves, and divided the nerves into two kinds, one for the purpo&s;e of &s;en&s;ation, and the other motion, and ob&s;erves that both kinds aro&s;e from the brain. He al&s;o de&s;cribes the ventricles of the brain; he was not aware that the arteries and veins carried the &s;ame fluid, but &s;uppo&s;ed that when the lungs were di&s;tended with air, it pa&s;&s;ed from the branches of the bronchia into tho&s;e of the heart, by which means he &s;uppo&s;ed the arteries were filled with it.</P>
<P><HI>Herophilus</HI> was contemporary with Era&s;i&s;tra|tus in the Alexandrian &s;chool. He di&s;covered the fourth &s;inus of the brain which &s;till retains his name; he fir&s;t named the plexus choroides, the tunica arachnoides, the retina and duode|num, he compared the fourth ventricle of the brain in figure to a pen, and called it calamus &s;criptorius.</P>
<P>Ammiames Marcellinus, who lived about &s;ix hundred and fifty years after the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
<PB N="10" REF="035232_0010_10017F3265C553A8">
of the Alexandrian academy, tells us, "They were &s;o famous in his time, that it was &s;ufficient to &s;ecure credit to any phy&s;ician if he could &s;ay he had &s;tudied at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lexandria."</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ROME.</HEAD>
<P>It does not appear that anatomy was culti|vated among the Romans before the Chri&s;tian aera; for though <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> in his excellent works, <HI>"de Medica,"</HI> con&s;iders anatomy as the foun|dation of medical knowledge. and u&s;ually gives a &s;hort, though generally correct, de|&s;cription of the parts before he de&s;cribes their di&s;ea&s;es, yet it appears that the&s;e de&s;criptions were almo&s;t entirely taken from the great phy&s;icians, and there are &s;carcely any improve|ments to be met with till near two hundred years after the birth of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Ruffus</HI> wrote a work about one hundred and twelve years after Chri&s;t, in which he de&s;cribes the recurrent nerves, and ob&s;erves, that if pre&s;&s;ure be made on the carotid arteries, the per&s;on will lo&s;e his voice from the&s;e nerves being compre&s;&s;ed being &s;ituated on the &s;ides of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els; he al&s;o de&s;cribes the fallopean tubes, which were parts not known to pre|ceding anatomi&s;ts.</P>
<P>We now arrive at a period when a very ela|borate work was publi&s;hed at Rome by Galen, who is &s;aid to have been born at Pergamus,
<PB N="11" REF="035232_0011_10017F3426E91AF8">
about the year one hundred thirty and one, and flouri&s;hed about one hundred and &s;eventy.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark, this celebrated phy|&s;ician and philo&s;opher, though a very great admirer and accurate ob&s;erver of nature, lived to nearly the meridian of life an athei&s;t, till one day alone in &s;earch of natural productions, he found a human &s;keleton, which lay expo&s;ed on the way &s;ide&mdash;the &s;ingularity of the event drew his attention, and in examining the wonderful machini&s;m of his own frame, he was well a&s;&s;ured it was of too curious and beautiful a formation to be the production of chance, and that none but a power infinitely &s;uperior to man could produce &s;o &s;trangely ad|mirable a phenomenon; he was in&s;tantaneou&s;|ly converted to the belief of a Supreme Be|ing, and fell upon his knees and bur&s;t forth in loud acclamations and prai&s;e&mdash;<Q>My Lord and my God! nothing but a Being Infinitely great as thou art, could ever form &s;uch a creature as man is,</Q> or to this effect.</P>
<P>His works contain all the learning of the foregoing ages, more e&s;pecially of the Alex|andrian &s;chool, where he &s;tudied. They are al&s;o enriched with de&s;criptions drawn from di&s;&s;ections of the organs of animals, which are frequently compared with tho&s;e of the human body, and in &s;ome in&s;tances has thrown light on the functions of organs by real ex|periments, particularly on the motion of the
<PB N="12" REF="035232_0012_100164CEC6C4D190">
blood and the importance of the pul&s;e. The&s;e works, therefore, are &s;tudied with entertain|ment, if not with in&s;truction&mdash;however, in general, it mu&s;t be admitted that his opinions were hypothe&s;is, but they were &s;o plau&s;ibly connected into a &s;y&s;tem, that he was implicit|ly followed for fourteen centuries. They have now long &s;ince been laid a&s;ide, as being in general the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">allies of a luxuriant imagi|nation.</P>
<P>Dr. Motherby, in his Medical Dictionary, has &s;aid, "The medicine of Galen had much affinity with that of Hippocrates, with this difference, that Hippocrates's depends on facts o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> experience, and Galen's on rea&s;oning. The genuine works of Hippocrates &s;tand the te&s;t of ages, and improvements are rather ad|ditions to, than alterations in him; but this is not the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to Galen."</P>
<P>He divides the body into four parts, viz. The <HI>abdomen, thorax, head</HI> and <HI>extremities.</HI></P>
<P>He has given a good de&s;cription of the ab|dominal vi&s;cera, the peritonoeum and abdomi|nal mu&s;cles; he &s;peaks of the difference of the human and brute liver; he believes it to be the principal organ of &s;anguiferation, and the origin of the veins. He has al&s;o de&s;cribed the cour&s;e of the venaportae from the inte&s;|tines to the liver. The &s;pleen, he &s;uppo&s;es, draws vi&s;cid humours from the liver by a ca|nal leading from the one to the other&mdash;he al&s;o
<PB N="13" REF="035232_0013_10017F37ADA6A158">
&s;ays it communicates with the liver by a branch of the venaeportae, and with the heart by the arteries. He has given a very good de&s;crip|tion of the &s;ecretion of urine; he &s;ays, that the kidneys have the faculty of &s;eparating the &s;uperfluous water from blood; that it is col|lected in a membranous cavity in the middle of the kidney, and that from this cavity a canal, to which he gives the name of ureter, pa&s;&s;es to the bladder, and enters it obliquely, by which the urine is conveyed. He has given a tolerable de&s;cription of the parts of genera|tion in both &s;exes; his de&s;cription of the gravid uterus is evidently from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&punc; In &s;peaking of the connection between the &s;oetus and mother, he de&s;cribes the cotyledons, and the urachus leading from it to the bladder; the &s;unis, he &s;ays, has two arteries and two veins.

the nerves as ari&s;ing from the brain, and traces them with tolerable accuracy. His book, "De Motu Mu&s;culorum," proves that he was well acquainted with the mu&s;cles and their functions. He has al&s;o given a good de|&s;cription of the bones, and their articulations.</P>
<P>The next anatomi&s;t of any reputation, was <HI>Soranus,</HI> of <HI>Ephe&s;us;</HI> he &s;ettled la&s;t at Rome. Some of his works are contained in Coelius Aurelicanus; he has written an original tract on the female organs of generation, in which (his de&s;criptions being taken from the human &s;ubject, are more correct than Galen's) he fir&s;t de&s;cribed the hymen when he was profe&s;|&s;or of anatomy at Alexandria.</P>
<P>In the fourth century the Roman empire was over-run with the northern Barbarians, and learning in a great degree extingui&s;hed in the we&s;tern parts; whil&s;t in the Fa&s;t the phy|&s;icians continued to follow Galen, and had little knowledge of anatomy.</P>
<P>We have in this period the works of AEtius, Paulus, AEgineta and Alexander, celebrated phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>About the end of the fourth century, <HI>Ne|me&s;ius,</HI> bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hop of Emi&s;&s;a, wrote a treati&s;e on the nature of man, in which, it was &s;aid, were contained two celebrated modern di&s;co|veries, the one on the u&s;e of the bile boa&s;ted of by <HI>Sylvius de la Boe,</HI> and the other, the cir|culation of the blood, claimed very ju&s;tly by

<HEAD>THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ALEXANDRIAN SCHOOL.</HEAD>
<P>In thu &s;ixth century Alexandria was taken by the Saracens, and the academy, which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted near one thou&s;and years, was entirely di&s;per&s;ed, and its celebrated library, the re|po&s;itory of the learning of the ea&s;tern parts of the world, was almo&s;t con&s;umed. How|ever, when the Saracens were quietly &s;ettled in their conque&s;ts, they began to examine the remains of the Greek and Roman writers, and by degrees tran&s;lated them into their own language, and added the hi&s;tory of &s;ome new di&s;ea&s;es, as the &s;mall-pox and mea&s;les, with &s;ome new remedies, the produce of their own country.</P>
<P>In anatomy they made no improvements; for according to the tracts of their religion, a per&s;on after touching a dead body was &s;up|po&s;ed unclean.</P>
<P>From the &s;uper&s;tition which at this time overwhelmed Europe, all the &s;ciences appear to have been at a &s;tand, until the eleventh century, when academies began to be built in Europe, the arabians carrying their knowledge into the we&s;tern parts.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="035232_0016_10017F3D951EC0E8">
Academies and univer&s;ities were in&s;tituted in Italy, and at Montpelier, in France.</P>
<P>For &s;everal years, however, the profe&s;&s;ors of anatomy contented them&s;elves with com|menting on the writings of the Arabians; &s;o that, from the time of Galen (which was near one thou&s;and years) the &s;tudy of anatomy, &s;o far from making any improvements, had been gradually lo&s;ing ground; for the writings of the Greeks and Romans had been almo&s;t for|gotten, and the original improvements entire|ly neglected, while the writings of the Ara|bians, which were very imperfect, had been &s;ub&s;tituted in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the fourteenth century an original work was written by Mundinus, in the year 1315, and although his de&s;crip|tions were extremely &s;uperficial and inaccu|rate, his books were &s;o highly e&s;teemed, that by the order of the &s;enate of Venice, the pro|fe&s;&s;ors at <HI>Padua</HI> were obliged to teach that only which occa&s;ioned a great number of com|mentaries upon it. This law was ob&s;erved for two hundred years</P>
<P>In 1440 the art of printing was di&s;covered, and nearly about the &s;ame time Con&s;tantino|ple, the &s;eat of the empire, was taken by the Turks; in con&s;equence of which learning was revived, and diffu&s;ed over Europe by the learned men, who fled from the &s;lavery of the Turks, and carried the original writings

of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> along with them into the we&s;tern parts.</P>
<P>The number of books now increa&s;ed very con&s;iderably, and before the end of the cen|tury &s;everal tolerable books of anatomy were publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>In the following century, the &s;pirit of im|provement was continued. The truly cele|brated Dr. William Hunter mentions, as the mo&s;t eminent anatomi&s;t of the fifteenth cen|tury, Leonardo da Vinci. He fir&s;t in&s;tituted anatomi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">al drawings, &s;ome of which are now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his Britannic maje&s;ty's great collection of original drawings, where the doctor was permitted to examine them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Va&s;&s;are's lives of Painters.</HI></NOTE> Se|veral di&s;coveries were made by Sylvius, Ni|cholaus Ma&s;&s;a and others; but their merit was greatly eclip&s;ed by their &s;ucceeding wri|ters, viz. <HI>Ve&s;&s;alius, Fallopius</HI> and <HI>Eu&s;tachius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Andreas Ve&s;&s;alius</HI> was born at Bru&s;&s;els, 1514, and is &s;aid to have &s;hewn a very early genius for anatomy; and after the advantage of &s;tu|dying in different univer&s;ities, he was appoint|ed profe&s;&s;or of anatomy at <HI>Padua,</HI> in the twenty-third year of his age. He fir&s;t pub|li&s;hed his compendium of anatomy when on|ly twenty five years of age, and afterwards his great work, in which he clearly de&s;cribes the various organs of the body, and teaches

<P>This genius rai&s;ed him above a &s;ervile at|tachment to the antients: he has taken his de&s;criptions from nature, and pointed out the errors of Hippocrates and Galen.</P>
<P>At the end of his work there are many ex|periments on living animals, in order to de|termine the u&s;e of organs, which merit par|ticular attention, and none more than tho&s;e on the blood ve&s;&s;els, which, when con&s;idered, it appears &s;urpri&s;ing that he mi&s;&s;ed the di&s;co|very of the circulation of the blood. He made a ligature on an artery, and ob&s;erved that it pul&s;ated on the &s;ide next the heart on|ly; he then cut the artery through, and joined the two extremities with a pipe, when the di&s;tant portion of artery pul&s;ated, though not when there was no communication. This experiment proved that their pul&s;ation de|pended on their being di&s;tended, which is an opinion diametrically oppo&s;ite to that of <HI>Galen;</HI> he proves that the arteries naturally contain|ed blood, by making two ligatures, and cut|ting out the piece; he &s;ays there is no com|munication through the &s;eptem from one &s;ide to the other of the heart.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="035232_0019_10017F41F0D4CB20">
By opening the che&s;t, he ob&s;erved that the heart cea&s;ed to act, and that the lungs were motionle&s;s, by inflating the lungs with a pipe in the trachiae, that the heart again perform|ed its actions; notwith&s;tanding the&s;e experi|ments, he &s;till adhered to the old hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>This great merit drew upon him the envy of his cotemporaries, who did not fail to load him with calumny; but having truth on his &s;ide, they were at length led to imitate him.</P>
<P>This great reputation cau&s;ed the Emperor Charles the fifth, to make him his phy&s;ician, by whom he was greatly e&s;temed, and which fixed him at court.</P>
<P>Ve&s;&s;alius's good fortune now met with a very &s;udden rever&s;e; he having obtained per|mi&s;&s;ion to examine the body of a Spani&s;h gen|tleman, whom he had attended as phy&s;ician, it was ob&s;erved where he opened the che&s;t, the heart palpitated. The parents of the de|cea&s;ed hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing of this &s;ad cata&s;troph, per|&s;ecuted him as a murderer, and accu&s;ed him be|fore the inqui&s;ition "of impiety." This &s;e|vere tribunal were going to puni&s;h his crime, when Philip the &s;econd, of Spain, found means to intercede in his favor, and he was ordered to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.</P>
<P>Soon after this, Fallopius died, and he was recalled by the &s;enate of Venice, to &s;ucceed him as profe&s;&s;or of anatomy at Padua; but

<P>Of all Ve&s;&s;alius's pupils, there is none which merits our attention &s;o much as Eu|&s;tachius who has very accurately de&s;cribed the &s;tructure of many parts which before had not been well under&s;tood The de&s;cription he has given of the kidneys has &s;carcely receiv|ed any addition by &s;ucceeding anatomi&s;ts; he has al&s;o explained their functions by experi|ments, and given a ma&s;terly account of their di&s;ea&s;es&mdash;he made &s;everal di&s;coveries on the organs of earing&mdash;he was the fir&s;t who named the vena azagos, and has al&s;o clearly de&s;cri|bed the thora&s;ic duct, its &s;ituation and cour&s;e, in a hor&s;e; but from his having &s;uppo&s;ed it to be a vein, the di&s;covery is not generally given to him.</P>
<P>He compo&s;ed a &s;y&s;tem of tablets, which lay hid for more than a century, not being brought to light till the year 1712, and which are at this day admired for their elegance and accuracy.</P>

The great outlines of the body, and its va|rious organs, were now well under&s;tood and de&s;cribed, but the oeconomy remained very my&s;terious.</P>
<P>Learning became now diffu&s;ed from Italy to the northern parts of Europe, and a &s;y&s;tem was publi&s;hed at Paris by Riolan, which re|mained for many years the common &s;tandard of anatomy.</P>

<HEAD>THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD.</HEAD>
<P>Dr. William Harvey, in 1628, publi&s;hed his works, "De motu Cordis et Sanguinis," in which he proves this great di&s;covery of the

circulation, a doctrine he had taught many years before. This doctrine, which at once overturned the theories of the time, as well as every former &s;y&s;tem, and led the way to the di&s;covery of many important truths&punc; did not fail to draw upon its author many adver|&s;aries, who fir&s;t endeavoured to di&s;prove the doctrine; but not being able to invalidate the truth of the &s;y&s;tem, they endeavored to a&s;|cribe it to &s;ome other author.</P>
<P>Harvey was born at Folk&s;tone, in Kent, in 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">78: he had the happine&s;s of e&s;tabli&s;hing his theory on the mo&s;t convincing and &s;olid proofs.</P>
<P>This great man was phy&s;ician to James the fir&s;t and Charles the fir&s;t, the latter of whom gave him the liberty of u&s;ing all the deer in the royal fore&s;t for perfecting his di&s;coveries on the generation of animals. It has been remarked that no phy&s;ician in Europe, who had reached forty years, ever to the end of his life, adopted Harvey's doctrine of the cir|culation of the blood, and that his practice in London dimini&s;hed extremely by the reproach drawn upon him by that great di&s;covery&mdash;He died in 1657, aged 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.

The following extract from Hall's Ency|clopaedia. on the late improvements of ana|tomy, and on the choice of anatomical au|thors, I pre&s;ume may al&s;o tend further to a&s;|&s;i&s;t the &s;tudies of anatomical pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>The anatomi&s;ts of this century have im|proved anatomy, and made the &s;tudy of it much more ea&s;y, by giving us more correct as well as more numerous figures. We have had four large folio books of figures of the bones, viz. Che&s;elden's, Albinus's, Sue's and Trew's&mdash;Of the mu&s;cles we have had two, one from Cowper, which is elegant, and one from Albinus, which, from the accuracy and labor of the work, we may &s;uppo&s;e will never be outdone. Of the blood ve&s;&s;els we have a large folio from Dr. Haller. We have had one upon the nerves by Dr. Meckel, and an|other by Dr. Monro, junior. We have had Albinus's, Roederer's, Jenty's and Dr. Hun|ter's works, upon the gravid uterus; Weit|brecht and Leber on the joints and fre&s;h bones; Soemerring on the brain; Zinn on the eye; Cotunnius, Meckel, junior, &amp;c. on the ear; Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er on the nerves of the thorax and ab|domen; Dr. Monro on bur&s;ae muco&s;oe, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to mention the anato|mical figures which have been publi&s;hed in this century, of particular and &s;maller parts of the body, by <HI>Morgagni, Ruy&s;ch, Val&s;alva,
<PB N="26" REF="035232_0026_10017F5933531578">
Sanctorini, Hei&s;ter, Vater, Cant, Zimmerman, Walterus,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e elegant plates on the brain, however, ju&s;t publi&s;hed by M. Vicq d'Azyr, mu&s;t not pa&s;s without notice, e&s;pecially as they form part of an univer&s;al hi&s;tory of anatomy and phy&s;iology, both human and comparative, propo&s;ed to be publi&s;hed in the &s;ame &s;plendid &s;tyle; upon the brain alone nineteen folio plates are employed, of which &s;everal are co|loured, The figures are delineated with ac|curacy and clearne&s;s; but the colouring is rather beautiful than correct. Such parts of this work as may be publi&s;hed, cannot fail to be equally acceptable to the anatomi&s;t and the philo&s;opher; but the entire de&s;ign is appa|rently too exten&s;ive to be accompli&s;hed within the period of a &s;ingle life.</P>
<P>To the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oreign treati&s;es already mentioned, we may add tho&s;e recently publi&s;&s;ied by Sab|batier and Plenk, on anatomy in general. Among our&s;elves, the writings of Keil, Doug|la&s;s, Che&s;elden the fir&s;t, Monro, Win&s;low, &amp;c. are too well known to need de&s;cription. The la&s;t of the&s;e u&s;ed to be recommended as a &s;tandard for the &s;tudents of anatomy; but it has of late given place to a more accurate and comprehen&s;ive &s;y&s;tem, in three volumes, publi&s;hed by Mr Elliot, of Edinburgh, upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> plan approved by Dr. Monro, and executed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y Mr. Fyfe.

has al&s;o obliged the world with an excellent &s;y&s;tem of anatomy, and another work, under the title of "Elements of Anatomy, and the animal oeconomy," in which the &s;ubjects are treated with uncommon elegance and per|&s;picuity.</P>
<P>In the latter part of la&s;t century, anatomy made two great &s;teps, by the invention of in|jections, and the method of what we com|monly call "preparations." The&s;e two mo|dern arts have rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly been of infinite u&s;e to anatomy, and be&s;ides have introduced an ele|gance to our admini&s;trations which in former times could not have been &s;uppo&s;ed to be po&s;|&s;ible.</P>
<P>They aro&s;e in Holland under Swammerdam and Ruy&s;ch, and afterwards in England un|der Cowper, St. Andre, and others, where they have been greatly improved.</P>
<P>The anatomi&s;ts of former ages had no other knowledge of the blood ve&s;&s;els than what they were able to collect from laborious di&s;|&s;ections, and from examining the &s;maller branches of them upon &s;ome lucky occa&s;ion, when they were found more than commonly di&s;tended with red blood. But filling the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem with a bright coloured wax, enables us to trace the large ve&s;&s;els with great ea&s;e, renders the &s;maller much more con&s;cpi|cuous, and makes thou&s;ands of the very mi|nute ones vi&s;ible, which from their delicacy
<PB N="28" REF="035232_0028_10017F61F859C418">
and the tran&s;parency of the natural contents, are otherwi&s;e imperceptable.</P>
<P>The modern art of corroding the fle&s;hy parts with a men&s;truum, and leaving the moulded wax entire, is &s;o exceedingly u&s;eful, and at the &s;ame time &s;o ornamental, that it does great honor to the ingenious inventor, Dr Nicholls.</P>
<P>The wax work art of the moderns might de&s;erve notice in any hi&s;tory of anatomy, if the ma&s;ters in that way had not been &s;o care|le&s;s in their imitations. Many of the wax figures are &s;o tawdry, with a &s;how of unna|tural colours, and &s;o very incorrect in the cir|cum&s;tances of figure, &s;ituation, and the like, that though they &s;trike a vulgar eye with ad|miration, they mu&s;t appear ridiculous to an anatomi&s;t. But tho&s;e figures which are ca&s;t in wax, pla&s;ter or lead, from the real &s;ubject, and which of late years have been frequently made here, are of cour&s;e very correct in all the principal parts, and may be con&s;idered as no in&s;ignificant acqui&s;ition to modern anatomy.</P>
<P>The proper or principal u&s;e of this art is to pre&s;erve a perfect likene&s;s of &s;uch &s;ubjects as we can but &s;eldom meet with, or cannot well pre&s;erve in a natural &s;tate&mdash;a &s;ubject in preg|nancy, for example.</P>
<P>The modern improved method of pre&s;erv|ing animal bodies, or parts of them, has been of the greate&s;t &s;ervich to anatomy, e&s;pecially
