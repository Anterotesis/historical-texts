<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>PSALM LXXXVII.2.</BIBL>
<P>THE LORD LOVETH THE GATES OF ZION, MORE THAN ALL THE DWELLINGS OF JACOB.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE heaven of heavens cannot contain the Almighty: Yet he conde&s;cendeth to dwell with man on earth, with him that is of a humble and contrite &s;pirit: He look|eth down from the habitation of his holine&s;s, with grace and goodne&s;s, on every humble &s;upplicant of his mercy: He acknowledges a temple, in every heart, that truly wor&s;hips him: He hears the mo&s;t &s;ecret prayer of retire|ment: And accepts, as a plea&s;ing &s;acrifice, even the hidden devotion of the inmo&s;t &s;oul.</P>
<P>Real piety, however, is not confined to the bo&s;om where it re&s;ides. And though, in the view of him who de&s;ireth truth in the inward part, that &s;ervice only is ac|ceptable, that is offered with a di&s;po&s;ition which can be di&s;cerned by none but God; yet genuine religion will not conceal it&s;elf from the public eye. Like the lamp that giveth light to every part of the hou&s;e, it will &s;hine in all our deportment; and be vi&s;ible through every part of our character, as men, and as creatures of the living God.</P>
<P>From a general conviction of this truth, probably hath ari&s;en the general con&s;ent of mankind, to the obligations of public and &s;ocial wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>However this may be, we find it to have been the prac|tice of all nations, from the earlie&s;t periods, to cultivate &s;ome public in&s;titutions of religion&punc; in which, in a &s;ocial manner, they pre&s;ented the &s;acrifices of devotion to the Deity.</P>
<P>It is our privilege, who enjoy the light of revelation. to know, that what men have generally e&s;teemed the fir&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="027135_0003_0FD495620A5A2198">
duty of &s;ociety, is a duty of the fir&s;t importance, and mo&s;t highly acceptable in the eye of God him&s;elf: As it is expre&s;&s;ed in our text, "The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob."</P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary to enter on a critical examination of this P&s;alm, in order to throw light upon the&s;e words. The rea&s;on of &s;o honorable a preference given to Zion, was that there was the &s;eat of the temple. There, in a peculiar manner, dwelt the divine pre&s;ence. Thence it plea&s;ed God to deliver the divine oracles, and to &s;end forth his prophets. And there was the place, appointed for the a&s;&s;embling of all I&s;rael, to pre&s;ent their united offerings to the Lord.</P>
<P>The chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, it is true, enlarges and ex|tends our privilege. God is not now confined to temples made with hands: And neither the mountain of Samaria, nor yet Jeru&s;alem, is entitled to the peculiar honor of his &s;acred pre&s;ence. The promi&s;ed hour is come, when the true wor&s;hippers wor&s;hip the Father in &s;pirit and in truth. In every place where men call upon the Lord, where two or three are gathered together in the name of Chri&s;t, he is there in the mid&s;t of them. We immediately perceive, however, on contemplating the&s;e circum&s;tances, how friendly an a&s;pect they have towards the public wor&s;hip of chri&s;tian &s;ocieties: And we naturally infer from them, that if it plea&s;ed God to honor with the peculiar tokens of his favor, the co&s;tly rites and laborious forms of the Mo&s;aic in&s;titutions, much more will he accept the &s;imple and unadorned, but &s;piritual wor&s;hip of the go&s;pel. In this view how animating and encouraging is &s;uch a declaration as this in the text, to every undertaking for the promotion of public wor&s;hip in the go&s;pel church: "The Lord loveth the gates of Zion, more than all the dwellings of Jacob." The import of this is, that God is plea&s;ed indeed with the &s;acrifice of an humble mind, with the &s;ecret wor&s;hip of the heart&punc; and with the retired offerings of the individual; but will more e&s;pecially ble&s;s and honor the public a&s;&s;em|blies of his &s;aints.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="027135_0004_0FD49565D2F4C498">It is my intention in con&s;idering this &s;ubject, a little more particularly to point out to you the benefits of public wor|&s;hip, and then to direct to &s;ome &s;uitable application of the di&s;cour&s;e. And,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. It is an important benefit of public wor&s;hip, that it promotes the improvement of human nature, in the mo&s;t u&s;eful and valuable attainments; in&s;pires and cultivates tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions and habits, which enable men to act their part with propriety, in the pre&s;ent world, and fits and prepares them for future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>It is obvious that the chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, of which we are now &s;peaking, is calculated to enlarge the &s;phere of the human under&s;tanding, pre&s;ents to its con&s;ideration many new objects of infinite importance to the happine&s;s of mankind, and if duly attended to, mu&s;t accelerate the advancement of the rational powers towards their highe&s;t &s;tate of perfection. Tho&s;e pure and exalted conceptions which the go&s;pel wor&s;hip in&s;pires of the great God, as the creator of the univer&s;e, the kind and gracious parent of his intelligent creatures, the righteous governor of the world, who di&s;po&s;eth all things, relating to men, for the promotion of the virtue, the wi&s;dom, and the happine&s;s of mankind: Tho&s;e glorious and &s;ublime ideas, under which the divine perfections are pre&s;ented to us, as the objects of our adoration: That humbling impre&s;&s;ion of our own condition, which is enforced on our hearts, as in a &s;tate of apo&s;tacy and revolt from God; and that illu&s;trious di&s;play of mercy towards fallen man, in the redemption, by which alone we can draw nigh to our Maker in hope: Mu&s;t at once enkindle the devout affections, in&s;pire with the love of virtue, and arm the &s;oul with fortitude in the pur&s;uit of divine attainments.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the frequent recollection of the&s;e great ideas, e&s;pecially with a view to the devout expre&s;&s;ion of our reverence and regard to God, cannot but rai&s;e the mind to a degree of elevation, far above what it is capa|ble of by any other means.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="027135_0005_0FD4956745332188">Doth the knowledge of human &s;ciences improve the under&s;tanding? Is the &s;oul enlarged by an acquaintance with the works of nature, with hi&s;tory and philo&s;ophy? How inferior are the highe&s;t attainments in the&s;e, to tho&s;e ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of the divine perfections, and of the my&s;tery of &s;alvation which we are taught in our holy re|ligion! Even in this view, the chri&s;tian wor&s;hip pre&s;ents us with a &s;ource of knowledge, the mo&s;t improving and &s;ublime. But while, by the&s;e means, it &s;ets before our eyes the perfections, the government, and the grace of God, in a light the mo&s;t amiable and captivating, in a light the mo&s;t encouraging to every truly pious and devout mind: There is a grandeur and &s;olemnity in the principles of the go&s;pel wor&s;hip, which mu&s;t at once awaken in the heart, a re&s;pect for the divine admini&s;tration and a di&s;po|&s;ition &s;uitable to our condition as lap&s;ed, but redeemed creatures.</P>
<P>What an awful and affecting circum&s;tance is it, for in|&s;tance, when a whole a&s;&s;embly pro&s;trate their &s;ouls at the foot-&s;tool of &s;overeign mercy: Where none pre&s;umes to claim acceptance, but on the principles of repentance and faith in the atonement of the redeemer! What an idea doth it give us of the &s;anctity of the divine laws, of the &s;trictne&s;s of his ju&s;tice, and of the wonders of his love, when we contemplate that a&s;toni&s;hing method of &s;alvation which is frequently pre&s;ented to our con&s;ideration, and ought always to be kept in recollection in our &s;olemn approaches to the Deity. How &s;trongly are the obliga|tions of piety and virtue enforced by the con&s;ideration of the re&s;pect which the&s;e &s;olemn tran&s;actions have to futurity. While in public wor&s;hip we &s;tand, as it were, on the con|fines of both worlds, an unbounded pro&s;pect opens upon us into eternity, and marks, with peculiar empha&s;is, the importance of our &s;tation and character here on earth. We are led to con&s;ider our&s;elves as probationers for a future &s;tate of exi&s;tence, in which we are to be fixed in everla&s;ting abodes of happine&s;s or puni&s;hment, agreeably
<PB N="7" REF="027135_0006_0FD49568BB0632F0">
to our improvement or neglect of the advantages and duties of the pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>Who that familiari&s;es the&s;e &s;entiments to his &s;oul, by a regular attendance on the duties of &s;ocial wor&s;hip, will not experience &s;ome happy influence of them on his heart! At lea&s;t, as far as religious principles can, in the nature of things, be effectual, he mu&s;t be rendered by them a wi&s;er and better man.</P>
<P>In proportion to the &s;incerity of his belief of them, they mu&s;t not only humble him in the du&s;t, as a &s;inner who hath forfeited the favor of heaven; and impre&s;s upon his heart a thankful &s;en&s;e of his obligations to redeeming grace: But di&s;po&s;e him, in all things, to maintain a con|&s;cience void of offence both towards God and towards man.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, under this head, that a &s;tated atten|dance on the ordinances of public wor&s;hip hath a ten|dency to fit and prepare the &s;oul for future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>As it improves and enlarges the under&s;tanding, as it in&s;pires with &s;entiments of devotion, as under the divine ble&s;&s;ing, it is highly in&s;trumental in purifying the heart, and promoting the habits of godline&s;s and virtue; it a&s;&s;i|milates the mind to that ble&s;t &s;ociety, who have already arrived at a &s;tate of perfection. But as it con&s;i&s;ts in it&s;elf, of a &s;eries of devout employments, it may be con&s;idered, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, as heaven already enjoyed on earth. The &s;ame gratitude and love, that animate the &s;ongs and in|flame the hearts of the redeemed in glory; the &s;ame unity of &s;pirit that binds them in everla&s;ting bonds of angelic affection, are already in &s;ome mea&s;ure in exerci&s;e, in every pure go&s;pel church on earth; and by means mo&s;t proper for the purpo&s;e, are in the way of improvement towards perfection.</P>
<P>While, therefore, we unite in the devout employments of go&s;pel wor&s;hip, we are in the practice of tho&s;e habits which con&s;titute the employments of the heavenly &s;tate; of tho&s;e habits which tend to imprint upon our &s;oul a &s;en&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="027135_0007_0FD4956C822CB3A0">
of our obligations to every moral virtue; of tho&s;e habits which refine and purify the heart, and fit and prepare us for eternity.</P>
<P N="2">2d. It is an intere&s;ting advantage of public <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters">ip, that it prepares the mind for tho&s;e trials to which human nature is unavoidably expo&s;ed; and furni&s;hes it with ar|mour again&s;t the ills and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of life.</P>
<P>It would be ea&s;y to expatiate on the forlorn and helple&s;s &s;tate of a man, without the benefits and con&s;olations of religion. He finds him&s;elf, by the very con&s;titution of his nature, in many re&s;pects, a child of &s;orrow. Through all the various &s;tages of his being, his way is marked with unexpected vici&s;&s;itudes. The blandi&s;hments of childhood and youth are &s;ucceeded by the woes of riper years. The pro&s;perity of the morning is eclip&s;ed by the afflictions which &s;uddenly ari&s;e to darken his horizon; and the &s;ha|dows of the evening de&s;cend upon him thickened with the gloom of melancholy di&s;appointment. Untaught in reli|gious truths, he perceives nothing in the ways of providence but my&s;terious darkne&s;s. He is lo&s;t in a labyrinth of in|explicable events. He knows not what to look for from pre&s;ent appearances; whether he may hope in the divine protection on the tempe&s;tuous &s;ea of life; or what is to be the final i&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e perplexing circum&s;tances with which he is &s;urrounded.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, what a &s;ource of light, of comfort and &s;upport are the ordinances of religion? In the go&s;pel we are in&s;tructed in tho&s;e ways of providence, which philo|&s;ophy and rea&s;on have attempted to inve&s;tigate in vain. We here learn, that the occa&s;ion of tho&s;e calamities which happen alike to the good and the wicked, is the univer&s;al guilt of human nature: That in the mid&s;t of the days of our vanity, however, God is the father and the friend of them that fear him: That he conducts the di&s;pen&s;ations of his providence with an eternal regard to order, truth and virtue: That, however complex our pre&s;ent &s;ituation may appear, he hath ordained an happy i&s;&s;ue to every event, in
<PB N="9" REF="027135_0008_0FD49570C6F7B100">
which the children of his mercy are concerned: That he hath opened a way for the deliverance of his fallen crea|tures, from all the inconveniencies which they are liable to on account of &s;in, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t his beloved &s;on: And hath &s;ecured to them that return to him and accept his grace, a pre&s;ent benefit in all their &s;orrows, and in future, a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</P>
<P>It would be a plea&s;ure to reflect on the&s;e truths&mdash;It would at lea&s;t, in&s;pire the &s;uffering mind with hope, were it only probable he might become a partaker in &s;uch ble&s;|&s;ings. But how much more cheering is it, in a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed hour, to know that God him&s;elf, hath appointed the means by which the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings flow to every creature, who &s;eeks them according to his go&s;pel: That for this end he hath "given &s;ome apo&s;tles, and &s;ome prophets, and &s;ome evan|geli&s;ts, and &s;ome pa&s;tors and, teachers, for the perfecting the &s;aints, for the work of the mini&s;try, for the edifying the body of Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>How &s;upporting, how encouraging is it in the mo&s;t try|ing &s;ea&s;ons of adver&s;ity, to be permitted to approach to the Almighty in tho&s;e &s;ealing ordinances, in which he ratifies the promi&s;es of his grace; in which he admits the claim of the children of his covenant on his favor and protec|tion: in which he renews and confirms the declarations of his grace and kindne&s;s towards them that hope in his &s;alvation, and are obedient to his word.</P>
<P>Do we derive &s;upport from religion in the &s;ilent hours of retirement? How much more may we expect it in the u&s;e and enjoyment of tho&s;e pledges of unchanging goodne&s;s, to which we are invited, in the a&s;&s;emblies of his &s;aints! <HI>That</HI> furni&s;hes a recollection of the grounds of peace and tran|quility, and of a better hope, and more &s;ub&s;tantial enjoy|ments hereafter: But <HI>the&s;e</HI> are the evidences, that en&s;tamp with a &s;acred authority all the promi&s;es of God, become a vi&s;ible &s;ecurity, on the part of heaven for the accompli&s;hment of his word, and add &s;trong con&s;olation to the confidence of the&s;e, who have fled for refuge, to the hope of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="027135_0009_0FD48ECAA8BD5DF8">In the</P>
<P N="3">3d Place; it is a high advantage of public wor&s;hip, that it is one of the be&s;t means of promoting and &s;trengthen|ing the benevolent and &s;ocial affections in the human heart.</P>
<P>There is no &s;ituation in which men can po&s;&s;ibly appear in &s;o endearing a point of light to one another, as when they are a&s;&s;embled in one &s;ociety, to adore the God and Father of the univer&s;e. No circum&s;tance &s;o effectually calls every generous affection into exerci&s;e, as when they offer their united prai&s;es, join in one common &s;upplication before the mercy &s;eat of heaven; and expre&s;s their earne&s;t hope and expectation of living together forever in the enjoyment of undivided ble&s;&s;ings in the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Here all di&s;tinctions die. All animo&s;ities and contentions cea&s;e. In the pre&s;ence of God we &s;tand all on one com|mon level. As &s;inners we are naturally alike; in the &s;ame &s;tate of condemnation, entitled to the &s;ame hopes, liable to the &s;ame fears, with an equal intere&s;t in the benefits of pardoning mercy, and equally concerned in the worthy performance of the duties we are employed in.</P>
<P>How much is it to the intere&s;t of mankind, that tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, which habituate them to con&s;ider one another in &s;o plea&s;ing a point of view, return as frequently as po&s;&s;ible! The&s;e are the mo&s;t effectual means of &s;oftening and human|izing the heart; and of promoting tho&s;e noble and gene|rous di&s;po&s;itions, which are the highe&s;t ornament of human nature.</P>
<P>It may be thought, that moral virtue may &s;ub&s;i&s;t equally well independent of religion. Articles of religious belief it may perhaps be &s;aid, are mere points of &s;peculation, which have little influence on the morals of mankind. But the ob&s;ervances we are pleading for, have an indi&s;pu|table effect on the &s;entiments of the heart; and in propor|tion, mu&s;t have a &s;en&s;ible influence on the life and manners of the &s;incerely con&s;cientious. In them, at lea&s;t, they mu&s;t promote a generous philanthropy; and will become a &s;trong &s;ecurity for their performance of all the duties
<PB N="11" REF="027135_0010_0FD49576773DC4F8">
which they owe to &s;ociety. Nay, even the incon&s;iderate and unthinking, who have not experienced the &s;ublime influence of religion in &s;o effectual a manner, may never|thele&s;s be re&s;trained by them in their career, and become better members of the community.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This appears to me to be a mo&s;t important con&s;ideration, in a young country, ri&s;ing by a &s;wift progre&s;s to opulence and power. As a nation advances in the&s;e, the &s;ources of luxury and plea&s;ure are multiplied, and generally produce a corruption and licentiou&s;ne&s;s of morals: And this by a natural con&s;equence leads the way to di&s;order and de&s;truction No &s;ufficient guard has ever yet been devi&s;ed by human wi&s;dom again&s;t this fatal proce&s;s. In many re&s;pects it does not lie within the reach of &s;ocial regulations; but a &s;en&s;e of God and religion naturally re&s;trains the exce&s;&s;es which grow out of a &s;tate of pro&s;perity, and teaches men to correct in them&s;elves, many of tho&s;e levities, which, however pernicious their tendency in &s;ociety, cannot be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by its laws.

<P>For the application of this &s;ubject:</P>
<P>What hath been &s;aid on the advantages of public wor&s;hip, may be con&s;idered as an argument of our obligation to encourage and promote it.</P>
<P>You have well done, my brethren, who have entered on this u&s;eful, nece&s;&s;ary and intere&s;ting undertaking in this place. The &s;ucce&s;s, which hath thus far followed your endeavours, and enabled you to repair a building for the wor&s;hip of God, which hath &s;o long lain u&s;ele&s;s and in ruins, is a plea&s;ing intimation of the favor of Providence on the de&s;ign. What hath already been effected, ought to evince to you, with what facility you may accompli&s;h any pious and u&s;eful undertaking, when you act in concert and with a willing mind. With equal ea&s;e, I doubt not, you will be able to proceed in the fulfillment of your plan, in e&s;tabli&s;hing among&s;t you, the mini&s;try of the word of God. Con&s;iderable and per&s;evering exertions may &s;till be requi&s;ite for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="027135_0011_0FD49577C5911068">Permit me, however, to remind you, that the object you have in view is well worthy of all your attention. When obtained, it will bring with it a reward, which will be of growing value to them that enjoy it, through all the changing &s;cenes of this mortal &s;tate, and which will &s;hine with inextingui&s;hable lu&s;tre in the world to come.</P>
<P>In this building you have opened a fountain from which, with the ble&s;&s;ing of God, will flow &s;ome of the mo&s;t invaluable benefits to your&s;elves, to your children, and to &s;ociety. The word of truth, di&s;pen&s;ed from this place, like a river that enriches the &s;oil, while it beautifies and adorns the country through which it pa&s;&s;es, will diffu&s;e tho&s;e &s;treams of religious knowledge which &s;hall improve the heart and better the under&s;tanding, and add the beauty of virtue to the life of many. No de&s;ign could be better calculated to promote individual or &s;ocial happine&s;s; for, while Chri&s;tianity forms a man for the enjoyment of him|&s;elf, while it furni&s;hes his mind with u&s;eful and intere&s;ting &s;entiments, while it refines his &s;oul, admini&s;ters comfort to him in adver&s;ity, and heightens his enjoyment in pro&s;|perity; while thus it multiplies and enlarges his means of per&s;onal &s;atisfaction, it renders him a more u&s;eful mem|ber of the community. The example of a good man is a public benefit; religion &s;heds a lu&s;tre on his conduct which makes it venerable; his virtues command the re|&s;pect, and recommend them&s;elves to the imitation of all around him; his pre&s;ence cha&s;es away vice and folly; and his conver&s;ation, generally, is promotive of &s;ound and u&s;eful knowledge.</P>

mankind, which can pre&s;erve that harmony, good order, and decorum, which are e&s;&s;ential to the common good. We find that this formed the ba&s;is of tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems of policy by which men have, from the earlie&s;t ages, been reduced to a &s;tate of &s;ociety; and if religion, darkened with ignorance and error, and burdened with &s;uper&s;tition, was &s;o precious an in&s;trument in the hands of the wi&s;e&s;t legi&s;lators and &s;overeigns, how much more may be ex|pected from it when illu&s;trated and explained in the purity and under the authority of the go&s;pel?</P>
<P>After all the parade that hath been made of philo&s;ophy, of the light of rea&s;on, and of natural virtue, it is to the influence of Chri&s;tianity that we are indebted for the great|e&s;t part of the refinement and purity of morals that is to be found among&s;t men at this day. As Chri&s;tianity hath &s;pread her light around, learning and the liberal arts have been more cultivated and improved; men have acquired a better knowledge of the general rights of human nature, have framed wi&s;e and liberal &s;y&s;tems of civil government, and are advancing towards that &s;tate of light and purity when they &s;hall no more hurt nor de&s;troy, and the
<Q>earth &s;hall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the &s;ea.</Q>
But, above all, by the light of Chri&s;tianity many are conducted in the paths of truth and virtue, are in&s;tructed in the knowledge of eternal life, and prepared for the everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;ings and felici|ties of the kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P>Such are the benefits you are obtaining, &s;uch the ad|vantages which, by divine goodne&s;s, you are enabled to promote in &s;ociety; and you have the greater rea&s;on to expect to &s;ucceed in it, when you recollect that it is a de|&s;ign on which the divine approbation is pronounced, in &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as tho&s;e in the text&mdash;
<Q>The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</Q>
Private methods of in&s;truction and improvement may ob|tain his ble&s;&s;ing, and be attended with advantage; but it is to public wor&s;hip, and to the &s;ocial u&s;e of divine or|dinances,
<PB N="14" REF="027135_0013_0FD4957B229D7B10">
that his favour is peculiarly promi&s;ed. This au&s;picious day places you, in that re&s;pect, in a &s;ituation the mo&s;t eligible and promi&s;ing. Many motives ari&s;e from this con&s;ideration, to induce your &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s and per&s;everance in promoting the cau&s;e which you have &s;o &s;ea&s;onably and &s;o judiciou&s;ly undertaken.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means you will contribute towards the ad|vancement of the be&s;t intere&s;ts of &s;ociety. You will pro|vide for the di&s;&s;emination of religious and u&s;eful know|ledge; you may probably have the &s;atisfaction of reclaim|ing many from the error of their ways; the benefit of your pious care will de&s;cend to the late&s;t po&s;terity; and the ble&s;&s;ing of millions, that were ready to peri&s;h, will come upon you.</P>
<P>Go on, therefore, with the re&s;olution and unanimity with which you have begun; endeavour to &s;trengthen among&s;t you the bonds of peace, and to be your&s;elves living examples of that virtue, benevolence and ju&s;tice, which are the ornaments of human nature, and which it is the de&s;ign of all religious in&s;titutions to promote. Above all, endeavour to obtain tho&s;e &s;aving benefits by the go&s;pel, which, as they will add a lu&s;tre to your cha|racter, and render you a ble&s;&s;ing to mankind, will al&s;o fit and prepare you for future happine&s;s. U&s;e your ad|vantages with a view to the renovation of your nature, and for your improvement in all holy and godlike attain|ments; that while, in the go&s;pel, you behold the glory of the Lord, as in a gla&s;s, you may be changed into the &s;ame image, from glory to glory, even as by the &s;pirit of the Lord; and may the God of all grace &s;hine upon you and ble&s;s you. In a peculiar manner may he own and pro&s;per this pious work, and cau&s;e
<Q>the &s;un of righteou&s;|ne&s;s to ari&s;e upon it with ble&s;&s;ings in his rays! Then &s;hall your light go forth as the morning, and your judgment as the noon day.</Q>
AMEN.</P>
