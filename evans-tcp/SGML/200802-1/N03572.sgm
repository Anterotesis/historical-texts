<P>YOUR Importunity, and the Rea&s;ons on which it is founded, have prevail'd upon me to publi&s;h the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, when no|thing el&s;e could have overcome my Aver|&s;ion to the Publication of them.

<P>Having therefore this Te&s;timony in your Hands, you may frequently review it, to &s;ee the Dealings of GOD with you and your Fathers, and your <HI>Calling</HI> to <HI>exalt him,</HI> and <HI>tru&s;t</HI> in Him. Let it&punc; be a Remembrancer to fix in your Minds the Sen&s;e of God's <HI>ancient loving Kindne&s;&s;es,</HI> and your &s;trong Obligations to an|&s;wer the pious De&s;ign of your Tran&s;plantation into <HI>this Wilder|ne&s;s.</HI> May tho&s;e Words of Grace to the People of I&s;rael be remembred and verified unto us,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jer.</HI> 2 2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, I remem|ber thee, the Kindne&s;s of thy Youth, the Love of thine E&s;pou&s;als, when thou wente&s;t after me in the Wilderne&s;s, in a Land that was not &s;own: I&s;rael was Holine&s;s unto the Lord, and the fir&s;t Fruits of his Increa&s;e; all that devour him &s;hall offend: Evil &s;hall come upon them, &s;aith the Lord</HI></P>
<P>The uncommon Sufferings and Hard&s;hips our Fathers endur|ed in their weari&s;ome <HI>Pilgrimage</HI> in this Wilderne&s;s <HI>to &s;eek a godly Seed,</HI> &s;hould endear their Memory to us, alleviate the Pre&s;&s;ure of our own Troubles, and obviate all our Complaints. Alas! our Sufferings are not worthy to be compared with theirs, <HI>in the Days of their Pilgrimage;</HI> who were in Perils by Robbers, in Perils by their own Country Men, in Perils by the Heathen, in Perils in the Wilderne&s;s, in Perils in the Sea, in

Perils among fal&s;e Brethren, in Wearine&s;s and Painfulne&s;s, in Watching often, in Hunger and Thir&s;t, in Fa&s;tings often, in Cold and Nakedne&s;s: Why &s;hould we then complain and murmur <HI>that the former Days were better than the&s;e?</HI> It is true, GOD may ju&s;tly complain of us, that <HI>as we have been in|crea&s;ed, &s;o we have &s;inned again&s;t him, and that from the Days of our Fathers we are gone away from his Ordinances and have not kept them.</HI> But yet <HI>he has not changed our Glory into Shame,</HI> nor <HI>taken his Kingdom from us.</HI> Our temporal Pro&s;perity and In|crea&s;e is an encouraging Argument that we are &s;till <HI>beloved for the Father's Sake,</HI> and for the Sake of the many Thou&s;ands in this Land that <HI>fear God and think upon his Name.</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible of the Darkne&s;s and Difficulty with which &s;ome of the Affairs of Government are perplexed at this Time; <HI>the Province is in great Affliction,</HI> but yet <HI>we are not in De&s;pair,</HI> &s;o long as <HI>our wi&s;e Men that are among us are our Pilots, and rule with GOD.</HI></P>
<P>And the revival of Religion among all Orders and Ages of Per&s;ons, and particularly of a public charitable Spirit (which we &s;hould all <HI>earne&s;tly covet</HI>) would greatly contribute to ex|tricate us from all our Difficulties and Dangers: for the Re|ligion of Je&s;us con&s;ults the Pro&s;perity of the State as well as of the Church; and the Practice of Godline&s;s will &s;erve the great Intere&s;t of both.

<HEAD>A MEMORIAL OF GOD's Goodne&s;s.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ISAIAH LXIII. 7.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>I will mention the Loving-kindne&s;&s;es of the LORD, and the Prai&s;es of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath be&s;towed on us: And the great Goodne&s;s towards the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, which he hath be&s;towed on them according to his Mercies, and according to the Multitude of his Loving-kindne&s;&s;es.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Day compleats a Century &s;ince the Foundation of this fir&s;t and ancient Church was laid. Memorable have been the interchangeable Providen|ces of God towards it in this Period, as we may well &s;uppo&s;e in the pre|&s;ent mutable State of Things: But it hath &s;urvived the various Changes of Time, <HI>according to God's Mercies, and according to the Multitude of his Loving kindne&s;&s;es. Having therefore
<PB N="2" REF="004367_0006_10044C50E6773AA0">
obtained Help of God, we continue unto this Day,</HI> a Mo|nument of his &s;paring Mercy under the vi&s;ible Decays of Piety among us; and have this happy Opportu|nity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon the Lord's Day when the Admini&s;tration of the Lord's Supper was attended, and the Church &s;olemnly renewed the original Church Covenant. The Church was gathered on Monday <HI>Sept</HI> 16. 1639.</NOTE> to commemorate and mention the Loving-kind|ne&s;&s;es and Prai&s;es of the Lord, according to all he hath be&s;towed on us in particular, and his great Good|ne&s;s towards his People in general, in the Di&s;pen&s;ati|ons both of Grace and Providence.</P>
<P>The&s;e Words are a devout Meditation and Expre&s;&s;ion of God's great and unwearied Goodne&s;s to his Church, and the Prai&s;es due unto him for it. They were &s;po|ken either by the Church, or by the Prophet in their Name, and are written for our Learning, and if I mi&s;|take not, will afford us &s;ome pious In&s;tructions and Reflections &s;utable to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Day.</P>
<P>Here I &s;hall ob&s;erve this important Truth as com|prehending the Sen&s;e of the Text, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That it has been the exemplary and pious Care of the Church of God to mention his Loving-kindne&s;&s;es, and Prai&s;es, accord|ing to all that the Lord hath be&s;towed on them in the Riches of his Mercy; to make a &s;olemn Mention &amp; Me|morial of the Riches of the divine Goodne&s;s, as indeed the Church of Chri&s;t on Earth, the Church Militant <HI>is full of his Riches.</HI> The Words of the Text are very empha|tical and full to this Purpo&s;e; they abundantly expre&s;s the Memory of his great Goodne&s;s, they expre&s;s the greate&s;t Sen&s;e and Acknowlegement of the Church of I&s;rael, for the great Goodne&s;s which God had be&s;tow|ed on them and on their Fathers, according to his Mercies, and according to the Multitude of his Loving-kindne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing on this Subject I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, 1. That it is the Duty and hath been the pious Practice of God's People to pre&s;erve and expre&s;s the Memory of his great Goodne&s;s to them. 2. It is al&s;o their Duty, and hath been their pious Care to expre&s;s the Prai&s;es of the Lord in Remembrance thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004367_0007_10044DC45833CD00">
I. I am to &s;hew, that it is the Duty and hath been the pious Practice of God's People to pre&s;erve and ex|pre&s;s the Memory of his great Goodne&s;s to them. This is the pious Re&s;olution of the Church of God, <HI>I will mention the Loving-kindne&s;&s;es of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath be&s;towed on us, and his great Goodne&s;s towards the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</HI> This &s;uppo&s;es a due Commemoration and Sen&s;e thereof, and that the Heart is warmed with deep Meditation thereon: For out of the Abundance of the Heart, the Mouth utter|eth the Memory of God's great Goodne&s;s, as the de|vout P&s;almi&s;t declares<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 39. 3.</NOTE>, <HI>My Heart was hot within me, while I was mu&s;ing the Fire burned, then &s;pake I with my Tongue.</HI> Again,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 77. 11, 12.</NOTE> <HI>I will remember the Works of the Lord; &s;urely I will remember thy Wonders of old; I will meditate al&s;o of all thy Work, and talk of thy Doings.</HI> Whereas Forgetfulne&s;s of God, &amp; his wonderful Works, robs him of the Glory of an honourable Mention of them; therefore the People of God &s;hould take great Care to keep in their Minds the Remembrance of his wonderful Works both to them&s;elves &amp; to the Church, le&s;t they bury any of them in ungrateful Oblivion, and re&s;train their grateful Acknowlegements of them: So they &s;hould refre&s;h &amp; &s;trengthen their Memory by fre|quent Recollection &amp; Meditation of them; that they may be always ready to mention them to the Prai&s;e of God. Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. It well becomes the People of God to make &s;o|lemn Mention of his Loving kindne&s;&s;es to them&s;elves. <HI>I will mention the Loving-kindne&s;&s;es of the Lord, accord|ing to all that the Lord hath be&s;towed on us.</HI> Every one that is godly will take particular Notice of God's Loving kindne&s;s to him&s;elf, and be ready to &s;peak of it to the Glory of God.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 66. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Come and hear all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my Soul.</HI> So &s;hould every particular Church and Society of Chri&s;tians con&s;ider and declare what <HI>great Things the Lord hath done for them;</HI> as the Church of I&s;rael celebrates the Memory of God's wonderful Works to

them,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 126 3.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord hath done great Things for us, where|of we are glad;</HI> as in their Plantation-Growth, Pre&s;er|vation, and remarkable Deliverances from manifold Dangers. But how great is the Sum of them! That Declaration of the P&s;almi&s;t &s;hould be often in our Lips<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 40 5.</NOTE>, <HI>Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful Works, which thou ha&s;t done, and thy Thoughts which are to us-ward, they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee. If I would declare and &s;peak of them, they are more then can be num|bred.</HI> But the more remarkable In&s;tances of God's Loving kindne&s;s &s;hould be &s;utably noticed &amp; celebrated by us as we are a Body of People, or a Communion of vi&s;ible Saints, a Church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The planting and &s;ettling of Churches is the <HI>Work of the Lord that he may be glorified.</HI> God &s;ends his Go&s;pel into <HI>one Place of his Dominion,</HI> and not into a|nother, affords to one Nation the Means of Salvation, and not to another, <HI>one Piece is rained upon,</HI> and made fruitful with the Doctrines of Grace and Salvation, <HI>and the Piece whereupon it raineth not, withers and is nigh unto Cur&s;ing&punc;</HI> This is a my&s;terious Di&s;pen&s;ation of the infinitely wi&s;e, good and holy God: He giveth no Account of this Matter, but <HI>Righteous art thou, O Lord, when we plead with thee; righteous in all thy Ways, and holy in all thy Works. Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</HI> It mu&s;t be re&s;olved into the divine Sovereignty; <HI>Even &s;o Father, for &s;o it &s;eem|ed good in thy Sight.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mat. 11. 25, 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus it plea&s;ed the &s;overeign and only wi&s;e God to &s;et up his Candle&s;ticks and cau&s;e the Light of the glo|rious Go&s;pel to &s;hine <HI>in the&s;e dark Places of the Earth which were full of the Habitations of Cruelty,</HI> not a Century and half ago&punc; This is the Doing of the Lord, and it &s;hould be marvellous in our Eyes.</P>
<P>The&s;e Churches have abundant Cau&s;e <HI>to &s;ing of the Mercy,</HI> the di&s;tingui&s;hing Mercy <HI>of the Lord,</HI> in plant|ing, watering, increa&s;ing and defending them to this Time: <HI>If it had not been the Lord who was on our Side,</HI> may the&s;e New-Engli&s;h Churches &s;ay, <HI>if it had not been the Lord who was on our Side, when Men ro&s;e up again&s;t

us, then they had &s;wallowed us up quick, when their Wrath was kindled again&s;t us. Our Help is in the Name of the Lord, who made Heaven and Earth.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hould with the Church of I&s;rael of old &s;et up our <HI>Ebenezer,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 7. 12.</NOTE> our Stone of Help and &s;ay, <HI>Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.</HI></P>
<P>This Church of Chri&s;t in particular &s;hould do it this Day, <HI>Set up </HI> a Memorial of the divine Goodne&s;s, and <HI>mention the Loving-kindne&s;&s;es of the Lord, according to all that he hath be&s;towed on us.</HI> This, this is the Day of the Gladne&s;s of our Heart, for <HI>God's manifold Mercies</HI> to us and to our Fathers, and if it be the Day of <HI>our E&s;pou&s;als to Chri&s;t</HI> we &s;hall have Cau&s;e enough to <HI>rejoyce in the Lord always with Joy un&s;peakable;</HI> The Lord grant it may be &s;o <HI>in his good Plea&s;ure</HI></P>
<P>This is a very proper Time to recollect, con&s;ider and rehear&s;e <HI>what great Things God hath done for us,</HI> as a Church and People, and for every one of us in particular, that we may be &s;utably prepared, di&s;po&s;ed and quickened to prai&s;e the Lord for them: Let us not neglect and mi&s;s the happy Opportunity, but diligent|ly improve it to the Glory of God, and to our Fur|therance in Chri&s;tian Knowlege, and practical God|line&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. It becomes the People of God to mention his great Goodne&s;s towards the Church in general. <HI>I will mention the great Goodne&s;s towards the Hou&s;e of I&s;|rael, which he hath be&s;towed on them.</HI> This indeed is a very copious Theme, and who is &s;ufficient to give the &s;acred Hi&s;tory? <HI>Who can utter the mighty Acts of the Lord? Who can &s;hew forth all his Prai&s;e?</HI> But it is our Duty, and it &s;hould be a &s;acred Plea&s;ure to re|volve in our Minds, and declare with our Mouths the wonderful Works of God to his Church in all Ages; tho' we are not able to &s;et them all in order.</P>
<P>The Prophet, or the Church, whoever it is that &s;peaks here, doth not confine the Con&s;ideration of the divine Goodne&s;s to them&s;elves of that Generation, but gene|rou&s;ly extends the Review of it to di&s;tant Ages of the Church that were pa&s;t; and mentions his great Good+ne&s;s
<PB N="6" REF="004367_0010_10044BE1E531CE08">
to the Church in general: And indeed there is &s;uch a &s;ummary of Church Hi&s;tory in the holy Bible from the Beginning of Time as may furni&s;h rich Mat|ter for our delightful Exerci&s;e in the Duties of Religion, both for Meditation, Prai&s;e and Di&s;cour&s;e. <HI>O how great is his Goodne&s;s</HI> which he hath be&s;towed on the Church from Age to Age.</P>
<P>As the Church of I&s;rael were formed and pre&s;erved by a Series of remarkable Providences, &s;o God took Care to pre&s;erve the Remembrance thereof in &s;everal Ways to the late&s;t Po&s;terity. Particularly,</P>
<P>Of their very remarkable Deliverance from the <HI>Aegyp|tian Bondage,</HI> and miraculous Pre&s;ervation in the Wil|derne&s;s forty Years, till their Introduction and Settle|ment in the Land of Cannan. The&s;e Things are &s;o full of the Wonders of God's Power &amp; Mercy that they well de&s;erved to be commemorated and acknowleged <HI>in all their Generations,</HI> and indeed in all Ages of the Church.</P>
<P>Accordingly, God commanded his People I&s;rael to tran&s;mit the Knowlege of them down to all their Ge|nerations: <HI>That one Generation might prai&s;e his Works to another</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 73 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE>. <HI>That the Generation to come might know them even the Children which &s;hould be born, who &s;hould ari&s;e and declare them to their Children, that they might &s;et their Hope in God, and not forget the Works of God, but keep his Commandments</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 44. 1.</NOTE> <HI>We have heard with our Ears, O God, our Fathers have told us what Work thou did&s;t in their Days, in the Times of old.</HI></P>
<P>This was one wi&s;e and effectual Method God took to pre&s;erve the Knowlege of his Will and Works in the Church of I&s;rael, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> PARENTAL INSTRUCTION.</P>
<P>Moreover, God in&s;tituted &s;everal Memorials or Mo|numents of his wonderful Works of Mercy to them. So the Pa&s;&s;over was in&s;tituted <HI>in Remembrance of his Mercy</HI> in bringing them out of Aegypt, when he <HI>&s;lew all the Fir&s;t-born in Aegypt, a Night to be much ob|&s;erved to the Lord in their Generations.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exod. 12. 26, 27.</NOTE> <HI>It &s;hall come to pa&s;s, when your Children &s;hall &s;ay unto you, What mean you by this Service?

<Q><P>So remarkable al&s;o was the Providence of God in conducting our Fathers to the Place where they at fir&s;t &s;at down,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">It was on the 9th of <HI>Nov</HI> 1620. that they made Land, <Q>after long bearing the Sea; and on 31&s;t of <HI>Dec.</HI> follow|ing, they kept their fir&s;t Sabbath on the main Land, at the Place now well known by the Name of <HI>Plymouth.</HI> At this Time Mr. <HI>Prince</HI> fixes the Aera of their Settle|ment here.</Q></NOTE> for it was be&s;ide their De&s;ign to &s;ettle on this northern Shore; being bound to &s;ome unknown Country further &s;outhward about <HI>Hud&s;ons River:</HI> But by their being guided hither they then unknowingly e&s;caped the greate&s;t Dan|ger of falling among the Multitude of Salvages at that Time filling the Countries about <HI>Hud&s;on's River,</HI> and were landed in a Place of greater Safety, where God prepared the Way for this feeble Company by thinning the Natives.</P>
<P>And as evident an Interpo&s;ition of Providence was the extraordinary Re&s;traints laid upon tho&s;e that &s;urviv'd that were di&s;po&s;ed to do hurt to God'<HI>s lit|tle Flock</HI> in this Wilderne&s;s.

<P>Thus God was plea&s;ed in a wonderful and extraor|dinary manner, to introduce and &s;ettle this handful of People on this &s;trange and di&s;tant Shore; and to pre|&s;erve them alive, and e&s;tabli&s;h them thro' a Series of kind and powerful Providences, in the mid&s;t of an in|finite Variety of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Difficulties and Dangers.</P>

We have heard with our Ears, O God, our Fathers have told us, what Work thou did&s;t for them in their Days, in the Times of old: How thou did&s;t drive out the Heathen with thy Hand, and planted&s;t them, how thou did&s;t afflict the People, and ca&s;t them out: For they got not the Land in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by their own Sword, neither did their own Arm &s;ave them; but thy Right Hand and thine Arm, and the Light of thy Countenance, becau&s;e thou had&s;t a Favour unto them.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm 44. begin.</NOTE></P>
