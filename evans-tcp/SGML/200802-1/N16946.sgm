<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT of the Author.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE de&s;ign of the&s;e E&s;&s;ays is to paint Religion in her native beauties. They are principally intended for youth, to give them ju&s;t views of Religion, and to per&s;uade them to love and practi&s;e it. The &s;ubject required me to &s;tudy per&s;pi|cuity and perci&s;ion more than elegance, and truth more than poetical embelli&s;hment. I am &s;en&s;ible the Poem will not bear a critical examination; but hope the faults are not &s;o nume|rous as to render the whole di&s;gu&s;ting even to nice judges.</HI></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A rural &s;cene. The appearance of Religion. The creation of all things by one Supreme Being; hence univer&s;al obe|dience inferred. The di&s;obedience and fall of man, and &s;ome of the angels. God's great goodne&s;s to man in pro|viding a Saviour: hence the highe&s;t prai&s;e, the warme&s;t love, and greate&s;t gratitude, are due to him. The cau&s;e why Religion is de&s;pi&s;ed. Religion and happine&s;s in&s;epa|rably connected. What great things it offers to us freely. Fal&s;e notions of Religion. The real effects of it peace, joy, &amp;c. &s;ubdues pa&s;&s;ions; removes the dread of death; de&s;troys his &s;ting; and makes eternity glorious. A view of the new Jeru&s;alem. Narci&s;&s;us and Lucinda, their happy life. Concludes with the folly of tho&s;e who de|&s;pi&s;e Religion, and a &s;erious addre&s;s.</HI></P>
