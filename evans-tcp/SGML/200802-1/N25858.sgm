<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO publi&s;h a Work with the Title borne by this, may, per|haps, by &s;ome, be thought pre&s;ump|tion, when it is recollected that Madame de Genlis has already oc|cupied the Dramatic line, in a man|ner to be imitated by few, and, probably, to be equalled by none.&mdash;But a compari&s;on of this work with the Theatre of Education, of that great Author, would be un|fair as to execution, and unju&s;t as to de&s;ign.&mdash;The Writer of this Work does not, like Madame de Genlis, intend her Dramatic Dia|logues to be performed; well a|ware that the length of the Scenes, in &s;ome places, and the &s;implicity of the Plot in all, would render them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lat and heavy in repre&s;enta|tion. The motives by which &s;he was induced to throw her Stories
<PB REF="034381_0003_0FFF0B15524D4998">
into Dialogue, were a belief that young people are ea&s;ily captivated and intere&s;ted by this manner of writing, and the convenience of a|voiding the <HI>"&s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,"</HI> and <HI>"re|plied &s;he,"</HI> which becomes &s;o fa|tiguing in a narration of any length, and which &s;he was &s;o often obli|ged to break in her la&s;t work.</P>
<P>This &s;hort explanation the Au|thore&s;s thought due to her&s;elf, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected of endeav|ouring to imitate one of the fir&s;t Authors the Age has produces.</P>
<P>If the&s;e &s;imple Dialogues &s;hould be con&s;idered as an additional bar|rier again&s;t the encroachments of Error, and an additional &s;upport to the efforts of Virtue, the Writer will be mo&s;t happy; and &s;he tru&s;ts them, tho' not without fear, yet not without hope, to the candour of a generous Public, who at lea&s;t will give her credit for purity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></P>

with their duty to that.&mdash;Thus when Cato &s;aw the dead body of his &s;on, he did not weep, becau&s;e <HI>true</HI> Sen&s;ibility exalted his mind to the height of patrioti&s;m, which made him willingly yield his &s;on a victim to Rome.&mdash;He wi&s;hed al&s;o to encourage the &s;inking Romans, by making their lives le&s;s valuable in their eyes, when he, to whom they looked for example, could &s;o chearfully par with that life which was dearer to him than his own.&mdash;What but Sen&s;ibility could have awakened this high &s;en&s;e of duty, and heroic re&s;olution?</P>

The beauty of the country daily increa&s;ed; the &s;pring was mild and forward. Her little boys William and Thomas had left &s;chool about ten days.</P>

The reluct|ant oak and the timid a&s;h, no lon|ger re&s;i&s;ting the warmth of the &s;un, were rapidly unfolding their fre&s;h leaves. The hedges and under|wood were every where green and afforded concealment and &s;helter to an infinite number of birds, now bu&s;y in building their ne&s;ts.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of their walk, little Thomas, who had wandered on be|fore, came running back out of breath, without his hat, which he held in his hand, and in which, with delight &s;parkling in his eyes, he &s;howed his brother a ne&s;t of young unfledged birds.</P>

<P>Poor, little, unfortunate creatures! &s;ee how they pant! I have no other objection to your buying them, my dear Wil|liam, than as I think it encourages idle boys to continue their cruel robberies on the birds. But, how|ever, as the&s;e poor mocking birds <HI>are</HI> pri&s;oners, I believe we may re&s;cue them out of wor&s;e hands, by taking them into ours. Can the boys there tell you where they took them from; perhaps, after they are out of &s;ight, we may be able to put them back into the tree where they were hatched.</P>

And alas! this is one of tho&s;e evils that &s;atire, excellent and ju&s;t even as this is, can do but little to cor|rect; for, as &s;ome periodical work, (I think the World,) in one of its e&s;&s;ays, ob&s;erves, coachmen, dray|men, cartmen, and drovers, do not read e&s;&s;ays; yet I have often fancied that &s;omething might be done to &s;often the cruel hearts of the lower cla&s;&s;es of people, if any per&s;on of abilities would adopt re|mon&s;trances to their comprehen&s;ion,

and teach them to fear hereafter &s;uch puni&s;hments as they now in|flict, in dreadful retaliation.</P>
<P>They were by this time arrived at the village, who&s;e few &s;trag|gling hou&s;es edged the exten&s;ive wood, and in a neat cottage found a decently dre&s;&s;ed woman, who&s;e hu&s;band was a farmer, and who was employed by Mrs. Woodfield to &s;pin for her. She de&s;ired the woman to bring out &s;ome flax in its raw &s;tate; de&s;cribed the pro|ce&s;s of making it into tow, fit for &s;pinning, and then made each of the girls &s;pin a thread. Not far from thence, in the &s;ame village, was a loom; they there &s;aw it woven into &s;heeting and other coar&s;e linen. Their walk home was de&s;ignedly varied. Mrs. Wood|field led them acro&s;s a ru&s;tic bridge, and along the banks of a rapid &s;tream that turned a paper-mill,
<PB N="11" REF="034381_0158_0FFF0FFE59850908">
into which they entered, and &s;aw the whole operation of making &s;e|veral kinds of paper. She then ex|plained to them the materials and means by which it was made; and bade them carry their imagination back, from the &s;talk of the flax they had &s;een, bearing a blue and &s;imple flower trembling on its &s;len|der &s;ummit, through all its changes and modifications till it contributes to make a &s;heet of paper.</P>
<P>This &s;peculation amu&s;ed them for the re&s;t of their walk. On their arrival at home, Matilda and Eliza, were agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed by a card they found upon their table, from a gentleman of their acquaint|ance, inviting the whole family to one of Mr. Duport's much admired Fancy Balls.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ure danced in the eyes of Matilda, when &s;he found Mrs.
<PB N="12" REF="034381_0159_0FFF100093039D60">
Woodfield intended to return an an&s;wer that they would accept this invitation. Nor was Eliza much le&s;s delighted. An immediate con|&s;ultation was held as to the arrange|ment nece&s;&s;ary; and Mrs. Wood|field, leaving them to enjoy this antepa&s;t of plea&s;ure, (all that life's deception frequently allow as to ta&s;te, and which is at their ages &s;o keenly ta&s;ted,) went to in&s;pect the little menagerie of the three young|er children, lately increa&s;ed by their mocking birds, about which they were anxiou&s;ly employed. It was more nece&s;&s;ary to repre&s;s their ill-judged &s;olicitude, than to reprove them for carele&s;sne&s;s of their little charge.
