<P>IT is an unhappy thing that &s;o ma|ny profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity are a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, al|though the Saviour warns all again&s;t &s;uch an amazing piece of ingratitude in a mo&s;t &s;erious manner, &s;aying, "Who&s;oever, therefore, &s;hall be a|&s;hamed of me, and of my words in this adulterous and &s;inful generation, of him al&s;o &s;hall the Son of Man be a&s;hamed when he cometh in the glo|ry of his father, with the holy an|gels." Yet notwith&s;tanding the&s;e awful warnings given by the judge of
<PB N="4" REF="018314_0003_0FA5C6F4355AA160">
all, this &s;in of being a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t prevails exceedingly at this day, and profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;ti|anity &s;eem a&s;hamed to have it known in the world, that they have any con|nection either with Chri&s;t or his go&s;|pel, although he has &s;aid, "Al&s;o I &s;ay unto you, who&s;oever &s;hall confe&s;s me before men, him &s;hall the &s;on of man al&s;o confe&s;s before the angels of God;" and again, "Who&s;oever therefore &s;hall confe&s;s me before men, him will I confe&s;s al&s;o before my fa|ther which is in heaven." What can be more terrible than to have Chri&s;t a&s;hamed of us before his father, and the holy angels? Or more glorious than to be owned and confe&s;&s;ed by him? And yet we find that &s;atan's children and &s;ervants are much bold|er in his &s;ervice than Chri&s;tians in ge|neral are in the &s;ervice of their God. The more is the pity! This is "for a lamentation, and &s;hall be for a la|mentation;" I remember to have
<PB N="5" REF="018314_0004_0FA5C6F57B6C5760">
heard of a certain Chri&s;tian who hap|pened in company with &s;ome wicked worldlings, who&s;e conver&s;ation was very trifling and profane; he bore it as long as he was able, and then ex|claimed thus, "Gentlemen, you make me a&s;hamed of my&s;elf; you &s;erve &s;uch a bad ma&s;ter &s;o faithfully, and I who have &s;o good a ma&s;ter, even Je&s;us, am almo&s;t a&s;hamed to own him." I believe this reproof may be taken by profe&s;&s;ors in gene|ral.</P>
<P>St. Paul was &s;o happy that he could &s;ay with truth, that he was not a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel; and oh, that we may all be &s;o ble&s;&s;ed as heartily to join him in the words of my text, and each one &s;ay with the heart, mouth, and conduct, "For I am not a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; for it is the power of God unto &s;al|vation to every one that believeth; to the Jew fir&s;t, and al&s;o to the Greek."</P>
<P>Let us, in the fir&s;t place, con&s;ider what the go&s;pel is:</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="018314_0005_0FA5C6F5ECABF578">
Secondly, What St. Paul meant by not being a&s;hamed of it:</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, The rea&s;ons why none &s;hould be a&s;hamed of it.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel &s;ignifies good news, glad tidings of great joy; and may be taken in general to comprehend all the declarations of God's good will towards his poor creatures; to|gether with all tho&s;e gracious encou|ragements, invitations, and promi&s;es, given us in the &s;acred pages, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Saviour.</P>
<P>As this &s;ubject is very copious, I mu&s;t beg your patience, while I at|tempt to &s;et forth &s;ome of the many gracious declarations made in the go&s;pel of our God.</P>
<P>But before I proceed directly to &s;hew what the go&s;pel is, give me leave to remind you, that you are not to attend thereto as &s;cholars or critics, but as poor, helple&s;s, mi&s;er|able &s;inners, who have the greate&s;t need of the real enjoyment of tho&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="018314_0006_0FA5C6F8F83FA0B0">
rich trea&s;ures which it brings; and believe me, that the go&s;pel will never be of much real &s;ervice to you, till you feel your need of it, as a hungry man feels his need of food, or as a thir&s;ty man feels his need of drink, or a &s;ick man feels his need of health, &amp;c. For it is a truth, that the glorious ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel mu&s;t be as truly enjoyed by the &s;pi|ritual &s;en&s;es of the &s;oul, to be of &s;ervice thereto, as food and drink mu&s;t be received into the body, in order to nouri&s;h it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to mention &s;ome of tho&s;e glorious truths, which are good news to men. That GOD taketh no plea&s;ure in the death of the &s;inner, is very good news, much better than we are commonly taught to believe; for &s;ome have the daring boldne&s;s to tell us, that GOD is as much glorified, and plea&s;ed with the damnation as with the &s;alvation of his creatures; which they vainly give
<PB N="8" REF="018314_0007_0FA5C6FA25D16198">
as the rea&s;on why the torments of hell &s;hall never end. But let us &s;ee what pains GOD takes to root this belief, of his delighting in the death of a &s;inner, out of our minds. He &s;ays, "Have I any plea&s;ure at all that the wicked &s;hould die? &s;aith the Lord GOD; and not that he &s;hould return from his ways and live?" Here he fir&s;t propo&s;es it by way of a que&s;tion, but in &s;uch a manner as implies a &s;trong negative; have I any plea&s;ure at all that the wicked &s;hould die? Can it be &s;up|po&s;ed that I have any plea&s;ure there|in at all? but le&s;t any &s;hould an&s;wer the que&s;tion in the affirmative (as many do) GOD farther &s;ays, "For I have no plea&s;ure in the death of him that dieth, &s;aith the Lord GOD, wherefore turn, and live ye." And left any thing &s;hould be wanting to confirm this truth, GOD in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner adds his oath, and becau&s;e he could &s;wear
<PB N="9" REF="018314_0008_0FA5C6FA4F1B8DC0">
by no greater, he &s;wore by him&s;elf; &s;aying, "Say unto them, As I live, &s;aith the Lord GOD, I have no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: Turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways; for why will ye die, oh hou&s;e of I&s;rael?"</P>
<P>I remember well the &s;en&s;ele&s;s ca|vil I formerly u&s;ed again&s;t the force of this text; which was, that the death &s;poken of was a &s;tate of cap|tivity in Babylon, with which God threatened them unle&s;s they turned to him, and which he had no plea|&s;ure in inflicting upon them; never con&s;idering, that if he took no plea|&s;ure in that &s;hort outward calamity, he certainly could take no plea&s;ure in that dreadful cur&s;e of the &s;econd death, which will come upon the wicked, or tho&s;e who die in their &s;ins.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="018314_0009_0FA5C6FAE9EF9880">
But now, &s;ince God hath &s;worn that he taketh no plea&s;ure at all in the death of a &s;inner, I think it is &s;afer to believe him, than to believe tho&s;e who tell us, that he delights as much in the damnation of the wicked, as in the &s;alvation of the righteous.</P>
<P>Now if this were all the good news that we could find, it would be very good; to think that our God takes no plea&s;ure in our death, and even pities us when we feel the con&s;equences of our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, put the ca&s;e that he was not able to help us, would be infinitely more comfortable than to be told, that he was full of fury again&s;t us, and willed our de&s;truction. But, ble&s;&s;ed be God, this is not the only good news the go&s;pel brings us; we are informed that there is not only com|pa&s;&s;ion, but help, in God for us; "O I&s;rael, thou ha&s;t de&s;troyed thy &s;elf, but in me is thine help; I have
<PB N="11" REF="018314_0010_0FA5C6FBB6DCC8D8">
laid help upon one that is mighty; there is forgivene&s;s with thee; that thou maye&s;t be feared; the LORD is gracious, and full of compa&s;&s;ion; &s;low to anger, and of great mercy; the Lord is good to ALL; and his ten|der mercies are over all his works."</P>
<P>We are al&s;o told in the &s;criptures, that "<HI>God</HI> is love;" that "he is in one mind, and who can turn him? And what his &s;oul de&s;ireth, even that he doeth." God &s;ays, "I am the LORD; I change not; therefore, ye &s;ons of Jacob are not con&s;umed."</P>
<P>The go&s;pel not only a&s;&s;ures us that God is love, and unchangeable goodne&s;s in him&s;elf, but that he hath manife&s;ted it in that amazing gift of his &s;on, to be our &s;aviour; this great truth upon which our &s;alvation depends, is abundantly de|clared in the &s;acred pages; "For GOD &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten &s;on, that who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould
<PB N="12" REF="018314_0011_0FA5C6FC910E6CB0">
not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life; for GOD &s;ent not his &s;on into the world to condemn the world (which was already condemned) but that the world through him might be &s;aved;" &s;aid Chri&s;t to Nicodemus. And St. Paul &s;ays, "For when we were yet without &s;trength, in due time Chri&s;t died for the ungodly; for &s;carcely for a righteous man will one die, yet peradventure for a good man &s;ome would even dare to die; but GOD commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet &s;inners Chri&s;t died for us." And he el&s;ewhere &s;ays, "Moreover, brethren, I declare un|to you the go&s;pel, which I preached unto you, which al&s;o ye have receiv|ed, and wherein ye &s;tand; by which al&s;o ye are &s;aved, if ye keep in me|mory what I preached unto you, unle&s;s ye have believed in vain, for I delivered unto you fir&s;t of all, that which I al&s;o received, how that Chri&s;t died for our &s;ins, according to
<PB N="13" REF="018314_0012_0FA5C6FD32A98738">
the &s;criptures; and that he was buri|ed, and that he ro&s;e again the third day, according to the &s;criptures."</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the go&s;pel as the hi&s;tory of the my&s;terious incarnation, the wonderful birth, the holy life, the cruel, &s;hameful, and bitter death, the glorious re&s;urrection, the trium|phant a&s;cen&s;ion, and powerful pre|valent interce&s;&s;ion of our dear Re|deemer; and then attend to the&s;e de|lightful bla&s;ts of the go&s;pel trumpet, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> good will, peace, pardon, love, wi&s;dom, power, redemption, recon|ciliation, &s;alvation, and then remem|ber that the go&s;pel not only pro|claims a Saviour &s;uitable to all our needs, but al&s;o brings near to us a full &s;upply for all our wants, &s;uch as life for the dead, &s;trength for the weak, health for the &s;ick, deliverance for the captives, re&s;t for the weary, food for the hungry, drink for the thir&s;ty, clothing for the naked, &s;ight for the blind, clean&s;ing for the pol|luted,
<PB N="14" REF="018314_0013_0FA5C6FE65D614B8">
light for them that are in darkne&s;s, and comfort for all that mourn; we &s;hall view &s;uch a beauty in the go&s;pel, if we receive it aright, as will make us to "rejoice with joy un&s;peakable, and full of glory;" and cau&s;e us to cry out, that we are "not a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; for it is the power of GOD unto &s;alvation, to every one that be|lieveth." Let us then attend briefly to each of the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P>The <HI>incarnation of Chri&s;t,</HI> or his taking our nature into union with him&s;elf, is one of the glorious truths of the go&s;pel; of this St. Paul &s;aith, "without controver&s;y, great is the my&s;tery of godline&s;s; GOD was ma|nife&s;t in the fle&s;h;" and again he &s;ays, "GOD &s;ent forth his &s;on, made of a woman, made under the law." This was according to the pro|phe&s;y of I&s;aiah, who &s;aid "Rehold a virgin &s;hall conceive, and bear a &s;on, and &s;hall call his name Imma|nuel;"
<PB N="15" REF="018314_0014_0FA5C6FFD7DE3AC0">
of this my&s;terious incarna|tion the Lord &s;pake al&s;o by Jeremiah, &s;aying "How long wilt thou go about, oh thou back&s;liding daugh|ter! For the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth, a woman &s;hall compa&s;s a man." A mo&s;t won|derful thing indeed! This was joy|ful news to Mary, and is al&s;o to all of us; how did &s;he rejoice when Chri&s;t was conceived in her womb, and &s;aid, "My &s;oul doth magnify the Lord, and my &s;pirit hath re|joiced in God my Saviour; for he hath regarded the low e&s;tate of his handmaiden; for behold from hence|forth all generations &s;hall call me ble&s;&s;ed; for he that is mighty hath done to me great things, and holy is his name; and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to ge|neration, &amp;c."</P>
<P>But as the <HI>incarnation of Chri&s;t</HI> is good news, &s;o al&s;o is his <HI>birth.</HI> How did I&s;aiah rejoice in it, long before
<PB N="16" REF="018314_0015_0FA5C7002DA40178">
its actual accompli&s;hment! "For unto us a child is born, unto us a &s;on is given; and the government &s;hall be upon his &s;houlder; and his name &s;hall be called Wonderful, Coun&s;el|lor, The Mighty God, The Everla&s;t|ing Father, The Prince of Peace." And when Je&s;us was born, the an|gels from heaven proclaimed the good news to the &s;hepherds, and &s;aid, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be to all people; for unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Chri&s;t the Lord." This ble&s;&s;ed me&s;&s;enger was &s;uddenly joined by a multitude of the heaven|ly ho&s;t, who prai&s;ed God, and &s;aid, "Glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on earth peace; good will towards men."</P>
<P>If angels rejoiced in the good news of a Saviour born, how much more ought we, for whom in a more e&s;pe|cial manner he was made fle&s;h, and
<PB N="17" REF="018314_0016_0FA5C700EE2F6510">
dwelt among us! This St. Paul calls the go&s;pel of God, to which he was &s;eparated, "Which God had promi&s;ed afore by his prophets, in the holy &s;criptures, concerning his &s;on, Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, made of the &s;eed of David according to the fle&s;h; and declared to be the &s;on of God with power, by the &s;pirit of ho|line&s;s, by the re&s;urrection from the dead."</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>birth</HI> of the Saviour is good news to all people, and belongs to the go&s;pel, as one of the e&s;&s;ential truths of the &s;ame. The hi&s;tory of the <HI>holy life of Chri&s;t</HI> is known in &s;acred writ, by the name of the go&s;pel; thus there is the go&s;pel according to St. Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke, and St. John; and St. Luke begins the book of the Acts with the&s;e words, "The for|mer treati&s;e have I made, O Theo|philus, of all that Je&s;us began, both to do, and to teach." The glorious things taught and done by Je&s;us, are
<PB N="18" REF="018314_0017_0FA5C701AF6FB510">
all worthy to be dwelt &uacute;pon, as they open a rich trea&s;ure to poor &s;ouls in the my&s;tery. It is good news to men, to be told that the Saviour pa&s;&s;ed through life in &s;uch a manner as to have a &s;ympathy with all the &s;ons and daughters of di&s;tre&s;s; if you are poor, this was his ca&s;e; he &s;aid, "Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have ne&s;ts, but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his head;" his nouri&s;hment was often very coar&s;e, and his fare hard; alas, how little do &s;ome profe&s;&s;ors think of this, when they complain of every thing, as being too mean for them to eat, drink, or wear! If you are per&s;ecuted and belied, &s;o was he; they &s;aid he was <HI>mad, had a devil,</HI> was a <HI>gluttonous man, and a wine bibber,</HI> a <HI>deceiver,</HI> a <HI>bla&s;phemer,</HI> a <HI>&s;abbath breaker,</HI> and in fine, that he was both an enemy to God and man; all this the Saviour bore for us; and cannot we bear a little for him? Are
<PB N="19" REF="018314_0018_0FA5C7029DFF9C78">
you tempted? So was he, in all points like as we are, yet without &s;in; and therefore knows how to &s;uccour them that are tempted. Are you for&s;aken by your friends for the truth's &s;ake? So was he. Should you be per&s;ecuted to death, he was &s;o too. Should a cruel &s;hameful death be your lot, it was his al&s;o. Should the countenance of the father be hidden from you, it was the ca&s;e with him. Thus in every circum|&s;tance of life or death, Chri&s;t hath a &s;ympathy with his brethren.</P>
<P>The miracles which Chri&s;t wrought upon the bodies and &s;ouls of man|kind, may be reckoned as glad tid|ings, not only to tho&s;e who felt the immediate benefits of his goodne&s;s, but to us al&s;o; he healed the &s;ick, and he is able to heal us who have &s;ickne&s;s of &s;oul; he rai&s;ed the dead to life, and he is able to rai&s;e &s;ouls from the death of &s;in, to a life of holine&s;s; he cau&s;ed the blind to &s;ee,
<PB N="20" REF="018314_0019_0FA5C705CBADE9F8">
the deaf to hear, the dumb to &s;peak, the lame to walk, he clean&s;ed the lepers, he relieved the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, he ca&s;t out devils, he gave rea&s;on to tho&s;e that were mad, he fed the hun|gry with bread, he preached the go&s;|pel to the poor; and all the&s;e mira|cles he is able and willing now to work upon the &s;ouls of men; which is the be&s;t of news to tho&s;e that feel the need of an all powerful Saviour, to do the&s;e things in and for them.</P>
<P>As the miracles of Chri&s;t are good news to men, &s;o are his words. Oh, what good news it is to hear, that "God &s;o loved the world, as to give his only begotten &s;on, that who&s;o|ever believeth in him &s;hould not pe|ri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life; that God &s;ent not his &s;on into the world, to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be &s;aved; that all that the father giveth him, &s;hall come to him; and that he that cometh &s;hall be in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out!"</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="018314_0020_0FA5C70743B98D60">
The re&s;t which Chri&s;t hath pro|mi&s;ed to the weary, and the &s;afety to tho&s;e that put their tru&s;t in him, is good news; as are al&s;o all tho&s;e gra|cious promi&s;es, which the Saviour made in his life; of which time would fail me to make mention.</P>
<P>The <HI>death and &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t</HI> contain glad tidings for men; that he died for us, is good news, that he died for all men, is better &s;till, and that "he &s;hall &s;ee of the travail of his &s;oul, and be &s;atisfied," is the be&s;t of all.</P>
<P>He died for us, who believe in his name; he has opened the way, for us to follow him through death, into endle&s;s life; "He gave him&s;elf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and might purify to him&s;elf a peculiar people, zealous of good works; that he might deliver us from this pre&s;ent evil world; ac|cording to the will of God, and our father."</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="018314_0021_0FA5C707AD2C9EF8">
But the go&s;pel farther a&s;&s;ures us, that Chri&s;t died for all, as well as for his church; "He is the propitiation for our &s;ins; and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the &s;ins of the whole world." There are many pa&s;&s;ages which declare that <HI>he died for all,</HI> but never one in all the book of God, that &s;ays that <HI>he did not die for all;</HI> and indeed if the &s;cripture was &s;ilent in the matter, there is one ar|gument that would be &s;ufficient to convince any candid, ingenious, un|prejudiced mind, that Chri&s;t died for all without exception, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Chri&s;t died out of love to his poor fallen crea|tures; not one could be re&s;tored un|le&s;s Chri&s;t died; he mu&s;t have &s;hed all his blood to redeem but one, or few; and he could ju&s;t as ea&s;ily die for all, as for one, or a &s;mall num|ber; it would co&s;t him no more pain to die for all, than for &s;ome only; his blood hath as &s;ufficient virtue to clean&s;e the &s;ins of ten thou&s;and
<PB N="23" REF="018314_0022_0FA5C7088832A9D0">
&s;inful worlds, were there &s;o many, as of one &s;oul.</P>
<P>I do not know that any would pre|tend to deny any part of the argu|ment, and if all the parts are allowed, it will follow, that it would be rea&s;on|able to &s;uppo&s;e (even though the &s;crip|ture was &s;ilent upon the matter) that Chri&s;t died for all, &s;ince he could as ea&s;ily die for all, as for a few. That "he &s;hall &s;ee of the travail of his &s;oul, and be &s;atisfied," is a mo&s;t glorious truth; he &s;hall not lo&s;e his labour; to him "every knee &s;hall bow, every tongue &s;hall &s;wear; all things are given to him; but now we &s;ee not yet all things put under him; God hath highly exalted him, and hath given him a name, which is above every name, that at the name of Je&s;us every knee &s;hould bow, of things in heaven, things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue &s;hould confe&s;s that Je|&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."</P>

The de&s;ign of God is, "That in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fulne&s;s of times, he might gather together in one all things in Chri&s;t, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him; and having made peace through the blood of his cro&s;s, by him to reconcile all things unto him&s;elf; by him I &s;ay, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven." Thus &s;hall the Saviour &s;ee the fruit of his labour, in the en|tire de&s;truction of &s;in, and the "works of the devil," and the &s;ub|jection, and obedience of all things to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>death of Chri&s;t</HI> is good news to men, in that it was for all; and &s;hall be effectual to all, for the de&s;truction of the old man, or body of &s;in in all.</P>
<P>Next, <HI>the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t</HI> comes under con&s;ideration; this is &s;uch good news, and &s;o much de|pends upon it, that if it were not

true, we &s;hould be yet in our &s;ins; our preaching, faith, and hope, would be in vain; they that are fallen a&s;leep in Chri&s;t, would all be lo&s;t; and the go&s;pel would be without a foun|dation; but ble&s;&s;ed be God, we know that "Chri&s;t is ri&s;en from the dead, and is become the fir&s;t fruits of them that &s;lept; for as in Adam all die, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive." The re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t confirmed his doctrine, proved him the &s;on of God, the Saviour of the world, fulfilled the prophe&s;ies that went before of him, laid a firm foun|dation for our faith and hope, a&s;|&s;ures us of the re&s;urrection of our bo|dies at la&s;t, &s;hewed his &s;uperiority over death, hell, and the grave, was a certain prelude of the glory of his kingdom, and of his being victorious at the la&s;t over all his enemies; and to &s;ay all in a word, the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t is a full and certain proof, that all the promi&s;es of God, not yet
<PB N="26" REF="018314_0025_0FA5C70B892BCF10">
accompli&s;hed, &s;hall be fulfilled in their &s;ea&s;on; con&s;idered in all the&s;e points of light, the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t is one of the greate&s;t, be&s;t, and mo&s;t important pieces of news that ever was, or ever will be proclaimed to mankind, and which the apo&s;tles made the principal &s;ubject of all their di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>The a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t</HI> is another of the glorious truths of the go&s;pel; Chri&s;t has "a&s;cended on high, he hath led captivity captive, he hath received gifts for men, even for the rebellious al&s;o, that God the LORD might dwell among them." His public a&s;cen&s;ion &s;hews his heavenly original, for &s;ays Chri&s;t, "And no man hath a&s;cended up to Heaven but he that came down from Heaven, even the &s;on of man which is in Hea|ven; what, and if ye &s;hall &s;ee the &s;on of man a&s;cend up where he was before? In his a&s;cen&s;ion he "led cap|tivity captive," and thereby &s;hewed
<PB N="27" REF="018314_0026_0FA5C70C50273930">
"that he had fir&s;t de&s;cended into the lower parts of the earth; he that de&s;cended is the &s;ame that a&s;cended up far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things." The a&s;cen|&s;ion of Chri&s;t into the Heavens was a joyful &s;ight to his apo&s;tles, who be|held him go up; then we read, "And they wor&s;hipped him, and returned to Jeru&s;alem with great joy, and were continually in the temple, prai&s;ing and ble&s;&s;ing God." It is &s;aid in the p&s;alms, "God is gone up with a &s;hout, the LORD with the &s;ound of a trumpet;" and what a glorious day it was, when Je&s;us our great forerunner "entered for us into the holy place, having ob|tained eternal redemption for us; into Heaven it&s;elf, now to appear in the pre&s;ence of God for us; who, when he had by him&s;elf purged our &s;ins, &s;at down at the right hand of maje&s;ty on high!"</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="018314_0027_0FA5C70D141ED160">
"Seeing then that we have a great high prie&s;t that is pa&s;&s;ed into the Heavens, Je&s;us the &s;on of God, let us hold fa&s;t our profe&s;&s;ion; let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need; looking unto Je&s;us, the au|thor and fini&s;her of our faith, who, for the joy that was &s;et before him, endured the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame, and is &s;et down at the right hand of the throne of God;" who &s;ays, "To him that overcometh will I grant to &s;it with me in my throne, even as I al&s;o overcame, and am &s;et down with my father in his throne."</P>
<P>Thus <HI>the a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t</HI> is good news to us; he is gone into Heaven on our account, is accepted there, and will come again "the &s;econd time, without &s;in unto &s;alvation."</P>
<P><HI>The interce&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t</HI> is good news to men; and therefore it is
<PB N="29" REF="018314_0028_0FA5C70DAE276630">
&s;aid, "Who &s;hall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that ju&s;tifieth; who is he that con|demneth? It is Chri&s;t that died, yea rather that is ri&s;en again, who is even at the right hand of God, who al&s;o maketh interce&s;&s;ion for us; where|fore he is able al&s;o to &s;ave them to the uttermo&s;t, that come to God by him, &s;eeing he ever liveth to make interce&s;&s;ion for them; and if any man &s;in, we have an advocate with the Father, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righ|teous."</P>
<P>It is glorious news that we have &s;uch an high prie&s;t at the Father's right hand, who remembers us con|tinually, and who is touched with a feeling of our infirmities; for he was in the days of his fle&s;h "in all points tempted like as we are, yet without &s;in." Chri&s;t's interce&s;&s;ion &s;hould embolden us to draw nigh to God by prayer and &s;upplication; for he is the angel that offers up "the
<PB N="30" REF="018314_0029_0FA5C70E8B8C5068">
prayers of all &s;aints, with much in|cen&s;e upon the golden altar, which is before the throne;" and he will cau&s;e our petitions to come up with acceptance before God.</P>
<P>Thus the go&s;pel, as it &s;ets forth the incarnation, birth, life, death, re|&s;urrection, a&s;cen&s;ion, and interce&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, is good news to mankind, and what we have no rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of; &s;ince "it is the power of God to &s;alvation, to every one that believeth, to the Jew fir&s;t, and al&s;o to the Greek."</P>
<P>The go&s;pel proclaims "<HI>good will</HI> to men;" God's will re&s;pect|ing us is good, he wills our life, and not our death; he is gracious, and "long &s;uffering to us ward, not will|ing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to repentance;" cer|tainly God has good will towards his creatures, &s;ince he "will have all men to be &s;aved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth; for this is
<PB N="31" REF="018314_0030_0FA5C711AD4032B0">
the will of God, even your &s;anctifi|cation." He has more good will to|wards us than we can conceive, &s;ince all the good will we have towards each other comes from him; he is the fountain of kindne&s;s; and this good will of God is not only pro|claimed by the go&s;pel, as one of the truths thereof, but it is the very foundation upon which it &s;tands; for if God had no good will towards us, he would never have taken the lea&s;t pains for our &s;alvation, or have &s;ent us any glad tidings re&s;pecting the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel al&s;o publi&s;hes <HI>peace;</HI> God &s;aith "I create the fruit of the lips; peace, peace to him that is far off; and to him that is near &s;aith the LORD; and I will heal him."</P>
<P>Of Chri&s;t it is &s;aid, "For he is our peace, who came and preached peace to you that were afar off, and to them that were nigh;" he is called "The prince of peace;" and
<PB N="32" REF="018314_0031_0FA5C71351620708">
the go&s;pel is called, by way of emi|nence, "The go&s;pel of peace; as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the go&s;pel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!"</P>
<P>The go&s;pel proclaims Chri&s;t, who is the great peace maker; it pro|claims peace for dying rebellious men; it makes propo&s;als of peace to mortals; teaches them how to make peace with God, by taking hold of his &s;trength; the language of it to man is "Acquaint now thy &s;elf with him, and be at peace; thereby good &s;hall come unto thee;" and they who obey the go&s;pel &s;hall find "peace with God, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; the peace of God which pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding, &s;hall keep their hearts and minds through Chri&s;t Je&s;us;" and they &s;hall have that kingdom within them which is "righteou&s;ne&s;s, and peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t." It is &s;aid of
<PB N="33" REF="018314_0032_0FA5C714CEFCF5B8">
Chri&s;t, "And he &s;hall &s;peak Peace unto the heathen;" the go&s;pel is the way of his &s;peaking, "I will hear what God the Lord will &s;peak, he will &s;peak peace unto his people, and to his &s;aints; but let them not turn again to folly." How often Chri&s;t u&s;ed the&s;e words when he was upon earth, "Peace be unto you!" And the language of the go&s;pel is &s;till the &s;ame to tho&s;e that believe. The &s;pi|rit of the go&s;pel is a &s;pirit of peace; "The work of righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be peace; and the effect of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, quietne&s;s, and a&s;&s;urance for ever; great peace have they which love thy law, and nothing &s;hall of|fend them; thou wilt keep him in perfect peace; who&s;e mind is &s;tayed on thee; becau&s;e he tru&s;teth in thee." Chri&s;t &s;aith to his di&s;ciples, "Peace I leave with you, my Peace I give unto you; the&s;e things have I &s;poken unto you, that in me ye might
<PB N="34" REF="018314_0033_0FA5C7154E8D8A48">
have peace." Thus the go&s;pel pro|claims peace.</P>
<P>Another of the glorious bla&s;ts of the go&s;pel trumpet is <HI>pardon,</HI> or the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins; "Be it known unto you therefore, men brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins; and by him all that believe are ju&s;tified from all things, from which ye could not be ju&s;tified by the law of Mo&s;es." The language of the go&s;pel is "Re|pent ye therefore, and be converted, that your &s;ins may be blotted out, when the times of refre&s;hing &s;hall come from the pre&s;ence of the Lord; let the wicked for&s;ake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him&punc; and to our God, and he will abund+antly pardon." Chri&s;t him&s;elf, when he preached the go&s;pel of the king+dom of God, &s;aid, "The time is ful+filled,
<PB N="35" REF="018314_0034_0FA5C715F6C83B20">
and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent ye, and believe the go&s;pel; and the apo&s;tles went out, and preached that men &s;hould re|pent." So that it appears, that the go&s;pel proclaims pardon in connection with repentance and faith; where the&s;e are found, pardoning mercy is nigh. Chri&s;t "was manife&s;ted to take away &s;in, if we confe&s;s our &s;ins, he (God) is faithful, and ju&s;t, to forgive us our &s;ins, and to clean&s;e us from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t his &s;on, clean&s;eth us from all &s;in."</P>
<P>Chri&s;t is as able now as ever to pardon or take away &s;ins, and to &s;ay to the &s;oul, "Son, or daughter, be of good cheer, thy &s;ins are forgiven thee; thy faith hath &s;aved thee, go in peace; ble&s;&s;ed are they who&s;e ini|quities are forgiven, and who&s;e &s;ins are covered."</P>
<P>Alas, we &s;hould have but little hope from the go&s;pel, did it not
<PB N="36" REF="018314_0035_0FA5C716CA94E0A8">
bring us the glad tidings of pardon; for we have a long black catalogue of &s;ins. Let us reckon them up. Let us think of them over and over again.</P>
<LG>
<L>There is the &s;in of our nature, and there are the &s;ins of our practice;</L>
<L>Our &s;ins of principles, thoughts, words, and actions;</L>
<L>Of hearts, lips, and lives;</L>
<L>Of omi&s;&s;ion, and commi&s;&s;ion;</L>
<L>Of childhood, youth, and riper age;</L>
<L>Secret, and open;</L>
<L>Again&s;t God, our neighbours, and our&s;elves;</L>
<L>Again&s;t the law, and again&s;t the go&s;pel;</L>
<L>Again&s;t clear light, and endearing love;</L>
<L>Again&s;t vows and promi&s;es to bet|ter obedience;</L>
<L>Again&s;t heaven, and before God.</L>
</LG>
<P>"The crown is fallen from our head, wo unto us, that we have &s;inned; oh that our heads were
<PB N="37" REF="018314_0036_0FA5C71787416FE8">
waters! and our eyes a fountain of tears, that we might weep day and night for our &s;ins!"</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome may think the above catalogue tautology, or repetition; but I fear we have been guilty of a greater tautology in committing &s;ins than I have in mentioning them; but, ble&s;&s;ed be God, the go&s;pel pro|claims pardon and clean&s;ing for them all, through faith in a dear redeem|er's name, to the repenting &s;oul.</P>
<P>I am next to ob&s;erve that the go&s;|pel proclaims <HI>love.</HI> "Love is (&s;aid to be) the fulfilling of the law," and I am &s;ure that it is the very &s;ub&s;tance, and e&s;&s;ence of the go&s;pel; for therein a crucified Saviour is proclaimed, and the apo&s;tle John &s;ays, "Hereby per|ceive we the love of God, becau&s;e he laid down his life for us; in this was manife&s;ted the love of God towards us, becau&s;e that God &s;ent his only begotten &s;on into the world, that we might live through him; herein is
<PB N="38" REF="018314_0037_0FA5C7183084DA48">
love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and &s;ent his &s;on to be the propitiation for our &s;ins; and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us; God is love; and he that dwelleth in love, dwell|eth in God, and God in him; be|hold what manner of love the father hath be&s;towed upon us, that we &s;hould be called the &s;ons of God."</P>
<P>The whole go&s;pel, from beginning to end, appears to be one grand de|&s;ign, of everla&s;ting, &s;elf moved, re|deeming, correcting, and re&s;toring love. God him&s;elf being love, and having loved all his creatures when he made them, mu&s;t love them &s;till, unle&s;s he is changed &s;ince, which cannot be; for with him "there is no variablene&s;s, nor &s;hadow of turn|ing;" and therefore it is evident, that his love &s;eeks the recovery, and re&s;toration of his fallen creatures, and by all po&s;&s;ible methods to bring them back again to him&s;elf; for having
<PB N="39" REF="018314_0038_0FA5C71923B3B988">
loved us "with an everla&s;ting love, with loving kindne&s;s, with the cords of love, and the bands of a man," he hath drawn, and will continue to draw us, till we &s;hall all return again to the ocean of infinite good|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Oh my brethren, could we but view that love, which is in God to|wards each of us, it would cau&s;e us to for&s;ake all things, to be wholly &s;wallowed up therein; but I am not able to expre&s;s, or declare the fullne&s;s of it to you; "Oh come, ta&s;te, and &s;ee that the Lord is good;" &s;ure I am, the love of Je&s;us is the mo&s;t powerful attraction; if this will not draw our &s;ouls to God, what will?</P>
<P>But the go&s;pel not only proclaims <HI>love,</HI> but <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> too: "We &s;peak the wi&s;dom of God in a my&s;tery, even the hidden wi&s;dom which God ordained before the world unto our glory;" Chri&s;t is preached as the wi&s;dom of God; and he "of God
<PB N="40" REF="018314_0039_0FA5C719B0D8AB50">
is made unto us wi&s;dom, righteou&s;|ne&s;s, &s;anctification, and redemption." The wi&s;dom of God appears great, in creation; wonderful, in provi|dence; but oh, how will it for ever &s;hine in redemption! In the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, the mo&s;t con&s;ummate wi&s;|dom appears; therefore we preach Chri&s;t crucified, "unto the Jews, a &s;tumbling block, and to the Greeks fooli&s;hne&s;s; but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Chri&s;t the power of God, and the wi&s;dom of God." God's wi&s;dom is &s;o great, that not one of his gracious de&s;igns &s;hall fail; and the very ways that his enemies take to fru&s;trate them, &s;hall be the means of their accompli&s;hment; thus "he taketh the wi&s;e in their own craftine&s;s." Had the love of God been ever &s;o great, if his wi&s;dom had not been equal, love would have been un&s;uc|ce&s;sful; but love and wi&s;dom joined, are able to do great things; e&s;peci|ally
<PB N="41" REF="018314_0040_0FA5C71A6F8BFF40">
when we con&s;ider another thing that the go&s;pel proclaims with them, even <HI>power;</HI> love, wi&s;dom, and power, all agree in the &s;alvation of man; what love de&s;ires, wi&s;dom de|&s;igns, and power performs. The go&s;|pel not only proclaims the power of God, but is it&s;elf called in my text, "The power of God unto &s;alvation to every one that believeth;" the glorious go&s;pel proclaims "What is the exceeding greatne&s;s of his power to us ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty pow|er, which he wrought in Chri&s;t, when he rai&s;ed him from the dead; for though he was crucified through weakne&s;s, yet he liveth through the power of God; for the preaching of the cro&s;s is to them that peri&s;h fool|i&s;hne&s;s; but to us that are &s;aved, it is the power of God;" the go&s;pel is not to be preached with the "entic|ing words of man's wi&s;dom, but in demon&s;tration of the &s;pirit, and of

power; that your faith &s;hould not &s;tand in the wi&s;dom of men, but in the power of God; for the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power." The go&s;pel proclaims the power of God, in rai&s;ing Chri&s;t from the dead, al&s;o Chri&s;t's power in rai&s;ing us from the death of &s;in; as al&s;o the power that is given to him, to &s;ubdue all things, and totally to de&s;troy all the works of &s;in, death and the devil. "God hath &s;poken once, twice have I heard this, that power be|longeth unto God;" and oh, what a comforting thought is this, that the God of love is al&s;o a God of wi&s;dom, and of power, &s;o that his de&s;igns of grace &s;hall not fail!</P>
<P>In the go&s;pel is proclaimed, "The love of Chri&s;t, that pa&s;&s;eth know|ledge; the manifold wi&s;dom of God; and the exceeding greatne&s;s of his power."</P>
<P>The go&s;pel publi&s;hes <HI>redemp|tion</HI> to all, through the blood o
<PB N="43" REF="018314_0042_0FA5C71BF49D6BE0">
Chri&s;t; "Ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as &s;ilver and gold, from your vain conver&s;ation, received by tradition from your fathers; but with the pre|cious blood of Chri&s;t, as of a lamb without blemi&s;h, and without &s;pot; in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, ac|cording to the riches of his grace; Chri&s;t hath redeemed us from the cur&s;e of the law, being made a cur&s;e for us; that the ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that we might receive the promi&s;e of the &s;pirit, through faith; being ju&s;tified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; God &s;ent forth his &s;on, made of a woman, made un|der the law, that he might redeem them that were under the law; that we might receive the adoption of &s;ons."</P>
<P>Chri&s;t is &s;aid in &s;cripture to have "by his own blood entered in once
<PB N="44" REF="018314_0043_0FA5C71F06403458">
into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us; and for this cau&s;e he is the mediator of the New Te&s;tament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions that were under the Fir&s;t Te&s;tament, they which are called might receive the promi&s;e of eternal inheritance." Thus we &s;ee that re|demption through or by the blood of Chri&s;t is a &s;cripture doctrine, and proclaimed in the go&s;pel, and is for all; but there is an order to be ob|&s;erved therein; for fir&s;t, we read of a peculiar number, called "The hundred and forty and four thou&s;and, which had the name of God written upon their foreheads. The&s;e are they which were not defiled with women, for they are virgins; the&s;e are they which follow the lamb whi|ther&s;oever he goeth: The&s;e were re|deemed from among&s;t men, being the fir&s;t fruits unto God and the lamb; and in their mouth was found

no guile; for they are without fault before the throne of God; and they &s;ung as it were a new &s;ong before the throne, and before the four bea&s;ts, and the elders; and no man could learn that &s;ong but the hundred and forty and four thou&s;and, which were redeemed from the earth; the four bea&s;ts, and four and twenty elders, fell down before the lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of &s;aints; and they &s;ung a new &s;ong, &s;aying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the &s;eals thereof; for thou wa&s;t &s;lain, and ha&s;t redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and ha&s;t made us unto our God kings and prie&s;ts; and we &s;hall reign on the earth." Thus we &s;ee a redemption the fir&s;t born, and fir&s;t fruits; but does this exclude the re&s;t of man|kind from any &s;hare in the redemp|tion
<PB N="46" REF="018314_0045_0FA5C7208ACF9BD0">
of Chri&s;t? Far from it; for St. John &s;ays, "After this I beheld, and lo a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, &s;tood before the throne, and before the lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a loud voice, &s;aying, Salvation to our God which &s;itteth upon the throne, and unto the lamb." Here we &s;ee a body quite different from the church of the fir&s;t born, and fir&s;t fruits, which yet at la&s;t are to &s;hare in the glorious &s;alvation of Chri&s;t; the&s;e though they came out of great tribulation, wa&s;hed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the lamb. But as if this was not enough to prove the redemption of all, St. John &s;ays, "And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and &s;uch as are in the &s;ea, and all that are in them, heard I, &s;aying, Ble&s;&s;ing and honor

and glory and power be unto him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and un|to the lamb for ever and ever." It is impo&s;&s;ible to find a &s;ingle rational being in the univer&s;e excepted in this de&s;cription; and therefore it is plain that all &s;hall at la&s;t &s;hare in the re|demption which is proclaimed in the go&s;pel; which is a redemption, from &s;in and death, through the all pow|erful, all clean&s;ing blood of our glo|rious redeemer.</P>
<P>Another glorious truth which the go&s;pel publi&s;hes, is <HI>reconciliation</HI> be|tween God and creatures, without which there could be no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation or re&s;toration for fallen in|telligences; and therefore the &s;crip|ture &s;peaks of reconciliation often, and the go&s;pel proclaims it to man|kind as good news; "For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his &s;on, much more being reconciled we &s;hall be &s;aved by his life. And all things are
<PB N="48" REF="018314_0047_0FA5C72207659DA0">
of God, who hath reconciled us to him&s;elf by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and hath given to us the mini&s;try of reconcili|ation; to wit, that God was in Chri&s;t reconciling the world unto him&s;elf, not imputing their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation; now then we are amba&s;&s;adors for Chri&s;t, as though God did be&s;eech you by us: We pray you in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, Be ye reconciled to God."</P>
<P>Chri&s;t hath aboli&s;hed in his fle&s;h the "Law of commandments con|tained in ordinances, for to make in him&s;elf of twain one new man, &s;o making peace; and that he might reconcile both unto God in one bo|dy, having &s;lain the enmity thereby. Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his bre|thren; that he might be a merciful and faithful high prie&s;t, in things pertaining to God, to make reconci|liation for the &s;ins of the people."</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="018314_0048_0FA5C722B9F91C38">
Thus you &s;ee that the go&s;pel is called "The word of reconcilia|tion," it informs us that the blood of Chri&s;t hath opened a way for an entire reconciliation between God and us; therein we are kindly in|treated to be reconciled to God, &s;ince the alteration mu&s;t be on our part. Chri&s;t by his death laid the founda|tion for a perfect reconciliation be|tween Jews and Gentiles; and the go&s;pel a&s;&s;ures us that he will finally reconcile all creatures to God, him|&s;elf, and to each other.</P>
<P>"For it plea&s;ed the Father that in him &s;hould all fullne&s;s dwell; and having made peace through the blood of his cro&s;s, by him to reconcile all things unto him&s;elf, by him I &s;ay, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven; and you that were &s;ometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled;" and can and will at la&s;t reconcile all things to

him&s;elf. Oh glorious period, when all enmity, malice, and wrath &s;hall cea&s;e out of the creation, and all creatures &s;hall be reconciled to God and each other, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t the great reconciler!</P>
<P>Thus the go&s;pel brings us the glad tidings of reconciliation.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel of Chri&s;t al&s;o pro|claims <HI>&s;alvation;</HI> and this one word includes all that hath been &s;poken.</P>
<P>The very name "Je&s;us" &s;igni|fies "a Saviour;" thus &s;aid the an|gel "And thou &s;halt call his name JESUS; for he &s;hall &s;ave his people from their &s;ins:" and &s;o we read, "And when eight days were accom|pli&s;hed for the circumci&s;ing of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was &s;o named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb." Every time we read or hear that &s;weet name JESUS, we &s;hould remember that is always &s;ig|nifies a Saviour, and thus the angel

&s;aid "For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Chri&s;t the Lord." Chri&s;t and his &s;alvation is the &s;um of the go&s;pel, which in my text is &s;aid to be "the power of God unto &s;alva|tion to every one that believeth, to the Jew fir&s;t, and al&s;o to the Greek."</P>
<P>When Simeon took the child Je|&s;us into his arms he &s;aid, "Lord now lette&s;t thou thy &s;ervant depart in peace, according to thy word; for mine eyes have &s;een thy &s;alva|tion, which thou ha&s;t prepared be|fore the face of all people; a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glo|ry of thy people I&s;rael." This &s;al|vation &s;hall be &s;o univer&s;al, that "every valley &s;hall be filled, and every mountain and hill &s;hall be brought low; and the crooked &s;hall be made &s;traight, and the rough ways &s;hall be made &s;mooth; and all fle&s;h &s;hall &s;ee the &s;alvation of God." When Chri&s;t came into the hou&s;e of
<PB N="52" REF="018314_0051_0FA5C5D1EC640B50">
Zaccheus he &s;aid, "This day is &s;al|vation come to this hou&s;e; for the &s;on of man is come to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lofts"</P>
<P>Wherever the go&s;pel is received in the love of it, thither &s;alvation comes, and the ble&s;&s;ed effects of it are per|ceived in the &s;oul; the go&s;pel &s;alva|tion, if it prevails in the heart, de|livers from the love, reigning power, and guilt of &s;in, from the cur&s;e of the law, and the wrath to come.</P>
<P>This is called in &s;cripture "The end of faith; even the &s;alvation of &s;ouls; of which &s;alvation the pro|phets have inquired and &s;earched dili|gently." This &s;alvation is wholly a&s;|cribed to the grace and mercy of God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, "For by grace are ye &s;aved through faith; and that not of your&s;elves, it is the gift of God; according to his mercy he &s;aved us by the wa&s;hing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t. This is a faithful &s;aying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chri&s;t Je&s;us came
<PB N="53" REF="018314_0052_0FA5C5D2D97C0C40">
into the world to &s;ave &s;inners;" this is glorious news indeed, that Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners; if this is worthy of all acceptation, as doubtle&s;s it is, how much more is it &s;o when we are told he came to &s;ave or re&s;tore all; as St. Paul &s;ays, "This is a faithful &s;aying, and wor|thy of all acceptation; for therefore we both labour and &s;uffer reproach, becau&s;e we tru&s;t in the living God, who is the &s;aviour of all men, &s;peci|ally of tho&s;e that believe." Tho&s;e who believe, and follow Chri&s;t, &s;hall be &s;aved from the &s;econd death, "and &s;hall not come into condemnation;" but the grace of God &s;hall finally extend to the &s;alvation or re&s;toration of all men, and therefore we are taught to pray for all men; "For this is good and acceptable in the &s;ight of God our Saviour, who will have all men to be &s;aved or re&s;tored, and to come to the knowledge of the truth; for there is one God, and

one mediator between God and men, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us; who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;ti|fied in due time." Thus the &s;alva|tion proclaimed in the go&s;pel, is a great, a glorious, a powerful, and univer&s;al &s;alvation; "Behold, now is the accepted time, behold now is the day of &s;alvation," even the go&s;|pel day, and while that la&s;ts, the day of &s;alvation &s;hall la&s;t al&s;o; for &s;o long as the everla&s;ting go&s;pel &s;hall be pro|claimed, &s;o long &s;hall the everla&s;t|ing &s;alvation of God be manife&s;ted to his creatures. This &s;alvation is publi&s;hed to mankind, that they may look unto Je&s;us, who &s;aith, "Look unto me and be ye &s;aved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is none el&s;e;" but wo to them who reject the go&s;pel, "For if the word &s;poken by angels was &s;ted|fa&s;t, and every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and di&s;|obedience received a ju&s;t recompence of reward, how &s;hall we e&s;cape if
<PB N="55" REF="018314_0054_0FA5C5D4ED20B048">
we neglect &s;o great &s;alvation, which at the fir&s;t began to be &s;poken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him? See that ye refu&s;e not him that &s;peaketh, for if they e&s;caped not who refu&s;ed him that &s;pake on earth, much more &s;hall not we e&s;cape if we turn away from him that &s;peaketh from heaven."</P>
<P>But ble&s;&s;ed are they that can re|joice and &s;ay, "The Lord is my light, and my &s;alvation, whom &s;hall I fear? The LORD is the &s;trength of my life; of whom &s;hall I be afraid? Behold, God is my &s;alvati|on; I will tru&s;t, and not be afraid; for the LORD JEHOVAH is my &s;trength, and my &s;ong; he al&s;o is become my &s;alvation; therefore with joy &s;hall ye draw water out of the wells of &s;alvation."</P>
<P>God is frequently called "The God of our &s;alvation. Salvation is of the Lord; his ble&s;&s;ing is upon his people; &s;urely his &s;alvation is
<PB N="56" REF="018314_0055_0FA5C5D7E02074F0">
nigh them that fear him; that glo|ry may dwell in our land;" and the Lord &s;aith, "And to him that ordereth his conver&s;ation aright, will I &s;hew the &s;alvation of God." Thus we have &s;een that the go&s;pel pro|claims &s;alvation to men through Je|&s;us Chri&s;t; the whole &s;cripture &s;eems full of this glorious &s;ound <HI>&s;alvation;</HI> all &s;orts of characters are called to attend thereto; God &s;aith, "Heark|en unto me, ye &s;tout hearted, ye that are far from righteou&s;ne&s;s; I bring near my righteou&s;ne&s;s; it &s;hall not be far off, and my &s;alvation &s;hall not tarry; and I will place &s;alvation in Zion, for I&s;rael my glory; heark|en unto me, ye that follow after righteou&s;ne&s;s, ye that &s;eek the LORD; hearken unto me, my people, and give ear to me, O my nation; my righteou&s;ne&s;s is near, my &s;alvation is gone forth; lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens &s;hall va|ni&s;h

my brethren, let us take the apo&s;tle's advice, who &s;ays, "Work out your own &s;alvation with fear and trem|bling, for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure." We enjoy a ble&s;&s;ed di&s;pen&s;ation; a glorious price is put into our hands to get wi&s;dom with; O let us not mi&s;improve it, for great will be our condemnation if we do. Let us con&s;ider that Chri&s;t came not to &s;ave us <HI>in</HI> but <HI>from</HI> our &s;ins; and let us con&s;tantly remember that &s;al|vation is nothing but a deliverance from &s;in and its effects; therefore we &s;hould &s;eek continually to be purged and clean&s;ed from "all fil|thine&s;s of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, and to be perfecting holine&s;s in the fear of God, that we may be found of him in peace, without &s;pot and blamele&s;s; and let us account that the long &s;uf|fering of our Lord is &s;alvation; and to day after &s;o long a time, as it is &s;aid, To day if ye will hear his voice,

harden not your hearts." They who believe in this &s;alvation &s;hall never have occa&s;ion to be a&s;hamed of their confidence, "I&s;rael &s;hall be &s;aved in the LORD with an everla&s;ting &s;alvation; ye &s;hall not be a&s;hamed nor confounded world without end." So we &s;ee that it is a &s;ure, never fail|ing, full, free, rich, powerful and univer&s;al &s;alvation, which the go&s;pel proclaims; and is worthy of the at|tention of all mankind. Let us there|fore adore the God of our &s;alvation, "who hath &s;aved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpo&s;e and grace, which was given us in Chri&s;t Je&s;us before the world began." In the mid&s;t of all the de|lu&s;ions, errors and darkne&s;s of our day, which &s;o exceedingly prevail, and &s;hall bring a terrible de&s;truction upon tho&s;e who believe not the truth, but have plea&s;ure in unrighte|ou&s;ne&s;s, we may &s;ay with the apo&s;tle,

We will now conclude this part of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;ubject, that we have dwelt upon &s;o long, with the words of David, "Turn us O God of our &s;alvation, and we &s;hall be turned; cau&s;e thy face to &s;hine upon us, and we &s;hall be &s;aved; wilt thou not revive us again; that thy people may rejoice in thee?

<P>THE go&s;pel of Chri&s;t proclaims a &s;aviour &s;uitable to all our needs, and tho&s;e glorious ble&s;&s;ings of which it &s;peaks, are brought nigh to us therein; &s;o that we have no occa&s;ion to &s;ay in our hearts, "Who &s;hall a&s;cend into heaven? that is to bring Chri&s;t down from above; or, Who &s;hall de&s;cend into the deep? that is to bring up Chri&s;t again from the dead;" for the word is nigh un|to us, the ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel

continually &s;eek to open them&s;elves in our mouths and hearts, that we might feel the power in our &s;ouls, and obey the precepts in our lives.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel brings near <HI>life for the dead;</HI> by nature we are dead to the divine life, we are poor fallen mi&s;er|able creatures, full of the darkne&s;s and fire of hell, &s;urrounded with a body of gro&s;s fle&s;h and blood, which when|ever it falls off (unle&s;s we have the life of God revealed in us) leaves us &s;hut up in our own wrathful fire, which is our proper hell. People may deny being in a fallen &s;tate, but he only who never felt, nor ever &s;hall feel natural hunger, thir&s;t, &s;orrow, pain, death, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, envy, pride, wrath, vexation, di&s;appointment, cha|grin, or mi&s;ery of any kind, can &s;ay with truth, that he hath no &s;hare in the fall. We feel in us a "carnal mind, which is enmity again&s;t God, which is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be;" and
<PB N="64" REF="018314_0063_0FA5C5DE16FE1008">
mu&s;t therefore be &s;lain. "For to be carnally minded is death;" and from this dreadful death the go&s;pel comes to deliver us; "And you hath he quickened, who were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins; "Chri&s;t &s;aith, Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead &s;hall hear the voice of the &s;on of God; and they that hear &s;hall live:"</P>
<P>"I am the re&s;urrection and the life, he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet &s;hall he live. He that believeth on the &s;on hath ever|la&s;ting life: He that hath the &s;on hath life, and &s;hall not come into condemnation, but is pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life." The language of the go&s;pel is, "Hear, and your &s;ouls &s;hall live;" and the &s;criptures of the New Te&s;tament often &s;peak of Chri&s;t as our life, as giving him&s;elf for the life of the world; and where the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel is received, it de|&s;troys

or crucifies the life of the old man, which con&s;i&s;ts in &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, &s;elf righteou&s;ne&s;s, envy, pride, ma|lice, wrath, and the works of the fle&s;h; and rai&s;es up the life of God in the &s;oul, which con&s;i&s;ts in bene|volence, humility, meekne&s;s, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of God; or as the apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es the matter, the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel brings forth its own fruit, which is "love, joy, peace, long &s;uffering, gentlene&s;s, goodne&s;s, faith, meekne&s;s, temper|ance; again&s;t &s;uch there is no law; and they that are Chri&s;t's have cruci|fied the fle&s;h, with the affections and lu&s;ts."</P>
<P>The go&s;pel brings <HI>&s;trength for the weak;</HI> it is &s;aid of Chri&s;t, "A brui&s;|ed reed &s;hall he not break, and &s;moking flax &s;hall he not quench till he &s;end forth judgment into victory." It is good to feel our own weakne&s;s, that we may be able to &s;ay with St. Paul, "When I am weak, then am I
<PB N="66" REF="018314_0065_0FA5C5DF844BBB40">
&s;trong; I can do all things through Chri&s;t which &s;trengtheneth me."</P>
<P>St. Paul had a gracious an&s;wer, when he prayed to have the thorn in his fle&s;h removed, which was, "My grace is &s;ufficient for thee; for my &s;trength is made perfect in weakne&s;s." Upon which St. Paul &s;ays, "Mo&s;t gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Chri&s;t may re&s;t upon me."</P>
<P>By receiving the go&s;pel in our hearts, we are enabled to &s;ay, "God is the &s;trength of my heart," for "&s;urely &s;hall one &s;ay, In the Lord have I righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength."</P>
<P>"Wait on the LORD; be of good courage; and he &s;hall &s;treng|then thine heart; he giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he increa&s;eth &s;trength; they that wait upon the LORD &s;hall re|new their &s;trength; they &s;hall mount up with wings as eagles; they &s;hall run and not be weary, they &s;hall

walk and not faint; for as thy days, &s;o &s;hall thy &s;trength be." Thus the go&s;pel may be &s;aid to bring &s;trength near to the weak, as it teaches us where all our help lies, and directs us how to obtain it; and not only &s;o, but the power of God in the go&s;pel &s;trengthens and enables us to do his will, and to bear tho&s;e things which are laid upon us, which of our&s;elves we could not endure; and thus through the &s;trength of God revealed in the go&s;pel, "The feeble &s;hall be as David; and the hou&s;e of David &s;hall be as God, as the angel of the LORD before them." What a ble&s;&s;ed thing it is, when we are &s;ur|rounded with many powerful foes, to know that through the "blood of the lamb, and the word of our te&s;ti|mony," which is the go&s;pel, we &s;hall overcome them! And when we are called to do, or &s;uffer the will of God (for which we are not &s;ufficient of our&s;elves) to know that our &s;uffi|ciency
<PB N="68" REF="018314_0067_0FA5C5E1069B77A0">
is of God, and that the &s;trength which the go&s;pel brings near, is abundantly &s;ufficient to enable us to do and &s;uffer all that is required of us!</P>
<P>The go&s;pel brings <HI>health for the &s;ick;</HI> Chri&s;t &s;ays, "They that are whole need not a phy&s;ician, but they that are &s;ick."</P>
<P>By nature we are all di&s;ea&s;ed, "The whole head is &s;ick;" but a con&s;ider|able part of our mi&s;ery is that we know it not, or do not con&s;ider it; but when a &s;oul truly comes to be &s;ick of &s;in, the health brought by the go&s;pel is ready for its relief. Chri&s;t is repre&s;ented as a phy&s;ician, and he is more excellent for the &s;oul than any man is or can be for the body. An earthly phy&s;ician though he may have great knowledge of the con&s;titutions and di&s;orders of bodies, yet knows not all, he may be often ignorant both of the con&s;titution and di&s;order; but Chri&s;t, the great

away, and the prey of the terrible &s;hall be delivered. The captive exile ha&s;teneth that he may be loo&s;ed, and that he &s;hould not die in the pit, nor that his bread &s;hould fail." Chri&s;t &s;aid to the Jews which believed on him, "If ye continue in my word, then are ye my di&s;ciples indeed; and ye &s;hall know the truth, and the truth &s;hall make you free;" they could not admit that they were in bondage, as they were Abraham's &s;eed; but Je&s;us &s;aid, "Verily, veri|ly I &s;ay unto you, Who&s;oever com|mitteth &s;in is the &s;ervant of &s;in; and the &s;ervant abideth not in the hou&s;e for ever, but the &s;on abideth ever; if the &s;on therefore &s;hall make you free, ye &s;hall be free indeed."</P>
<P>The go&s;pel teaches us that the way to be free from the bondage and &s;la|very of &s;in is to die thereto, "For he that is dead is freed from &s;in; be|ing then made free from &s;in, ye be|came the &s;ervants of righteou&s;ne&s;s;

Thus the liberty which the go&s;pel proclaims is not a liberty or licence to &s;in (as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e and even affirm that we &s;ay) but a free|dom from &s;in, which is the only true liberty in the world; for whatever freedom fal&s;e teachers may promi&s;e mankind, while they them&s;elves are &s;ervants of corruption, the go&s;pel teacher us that true liberty con&s;i&s;ts only in dying to &s;in, and living to righteou&s;ne&s;s, or in glorifying God in our bodies and &s;pirits, which are God's. The go&s;pel proclaims that Chri&s;t hath a power both over the living and the dead, and he who once de&s;cended "and preached to the &s;pirits in pri&s;on, which &s;ometime were di&s;obedient, when once the

Thus the go&s;pel may be truly &s;aid to bring deliverance to the captives, &amp;c. as it proclaims an all powerful &s;aviour, with whom all things are po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>To you who have been already made free by the power of the go&s;|pel, St. Paul's exhortation is not ami&s;s, "Stand fa&s;t therefore in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made us free, and be not, entangled again with the yoke of bondage; for bre|thren ye have been called unto li|berty,

<PB N="92" REF="018314_0091_0FA5C5F9C79CF598">
that they which &s;ee not might &s;ee, and that they which &s;ee might be made blind."</P>
<P>As Chri&s;t opened the eyes of tho&s;e who&s;e bodies were blind, &s;o the de|&s;ign of the go&s;pel is "to open the eyes of the people, and to turn men from darkne&s;s to light: for God who commanded the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, hath &s;hined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>Chri&s;t coun&s;els the Laodicean church, &s;aying, "And anoint thine eyes with eye &s;alve, that thou may|e&s;t &s;ee."</P>
<P>Blindne&s;s is one of the greate&s;t natu|ral infirmities that we are &s;ubject to, and &s;piritual blindne&s;s is a criminal di&s;order, much more terrible: We are by nature blind to our own character, to the character of the deity, to the glorious way of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, to the beauties of the go&s;pel, and in

general to &s;piritual things; "the na|tural man receiveth not the things of the &s;pirit of God; for they are fool|i&s;hne&s;s unto him; neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piri|tually di&s;cerned."</P>
<P>We love darkne&s;s rather than light, yea we even hate the light, and &s;hut our eyes again&s;t it, becau&s;e it re|proves us; but when we come to be willing to receive the go&s;pel, and the love of the truth, we then find that "the commandment of the LORD is pure enlightening the eyes;" and that "the entrance of his word giv|eth light;" and thus we are &s;aved from our blindne&s;s, and brought to &s;ee things as they are, and "with open face, beholding as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame image, from glory to glory, as by the &s;pirit of the Lord."</P>
<P>The go&s;pel proclaims and brings near <HI>clean&s;ing for the polluted;</HI> we are all defiled and polluted with ini|quity;
<PB N="94" REF="018314_0093_0FA5C5FB320D27F8">
but there is "a fountain opened for &s;in and uncleanne&s;s." The great atonement of Chri&s;t was intended to clean&s;e us from &s;in, and not to extingui&s;h a wrath in the De|ity, as &s;ome imagine; hence it is &s;aid of Chri&s;t, "When he had by him&s;elf purged our &s;ins, he &s;at down on the right hand of the maje&s;ty on high; for if the blood of bulls and goats and the a&s;hes of an heifer, &s;prinkl|ing the unclean, &s;anctifieth to the purifying of the fle&s;h, how much more &s;hall the blood of Chri&s;t, who through the eternal &s;pirit offered him&s;elf without &s;pot to God, purge your con&s;cience from dead works, to &s;erve the living God? And almo&s;t all things are by the law purged with blood; and without &s;hedding of blood is no remi&s;&s;ion; it was there|fore nece&s;&s;ary that the patterns of things in the heavens &s;hould be puri|fied with the&s;e; but the heavenly things them&s;elves with better &s;acri|fices
<PB N="95" REF="018314_0094_0FA5C5FBEB0D31C8">
than the&s;e; for it is not po&s;&s;ible that the blood of bulls and goats &s;hould take away &s;ins; wherefore Je&s;us, that he might &s;anctify the people with his own blood, &s;uffered without the gate; he gave him&s;elf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar people zealous unto good works." And we are told that "the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t clean&s;eth us from all &s;in," and "that he was manife&s;t|ed to take away our &s;ins." Surely nothing can be plainer than that the de&s;ign of the atonements under the law was to clean&s;e from ceremonial pollution, and it is evident that the blood of Chri&s;t was &s;hed to clean&s;e us from all our filthine&s;s. Oftentimes in &s;cripture God is plea&s;ed to promi&s;e clean&s;ing to the polluted, "Though your &s;ins be as &s;carlet, they &s;hall be as white as &s;now; though they be red like crim&s;on, they &s;hall be as wool: Then will I &s;prinkle clean

all the&s;e evil things come from with|in, and defile the man." Since then it is evident that we mu&s;t be clean&s;ed from all impurity, before we can enter into the kingdom of God, what rea&s;on have we to magnify that rich grace, that brings clean&s;ing for our polluted &s;ouls! Let us therefore apply "to the blood of &s;prinkling, that &s;peaketh better things than that of Abel;" that all our pollutions may be wa&s;hed away, in that foun|tain which only is able to clean&s;e us from all "&s;in and uncleanne&s;s."</P>
<P>The go&s;pel brings near <HI>light for them that are in darkne&s;s;</HI> Chri&s;t in the go&s;pel &s;ays "to the pri&s;oners, Go forth; and to them that are in dark|ne&s;s, Shew your&s;elves."

<P>The &s;cripture &s;aith, "Who is among you that feareth the LORD,

that obeyeth the voice of his &s;ervant, that walketh in darkne&s;s, and hath no light? Let him tru&s;t in the name of the LORD, and &s;tay upon his God;" and the prophet &s;ays, "Re|joice not again&s;t me, O mine enemy; when I fall I &s;hall ari&s;e; when I &s;it in darkne&s;s, the Lord &s;hall be a light unto me; he will bring me forth to the light, and I &s;hall behold his righ|teou&s;ne&s;s. Light is &s;own for the righteous; unto the upright there ari&s;eth light in the darkne&s;s."</P>
<P>As the go&s;pel is compared to light in many places in &s;cripture, it is a very natural idea of it to &s;uppo&s;e that it enlightens tho&s;e who receive it, and directs them in the way wherein they &s;hould go. David &s;ays, "Thy word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my path." The go&s;pel is of more u&s;e to the &s;ouls of men than the light of the &s;un is to their bo|dies; and if Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples are called "The light of the world,"
<PB N="100" REF="018314_0099_0FA5C600749F8EC0">
with how much propriety may his go&s;pel be called &s;o! Without the go&s;pel, what darkne&s;s &s;hould we grope in! What ignorance of God and our&s;elves would over&s;hadow us! And it is to be lamented, that even where the go&s;pel &s;hines in its purity, it is hidden to many, "In whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, left the light of the glorious go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, who is the image of God, &s;hould &s;hine unto them;" the fault lies not in the go&s;pel, that men &s;ee not, but in that enmity which cau&s;es them to &s;hut their eyes again&s;t the light. But where the go&s;pel is re|ceived in the love of it, light is not &s;o dear to the eyes, neither &s;o plea|&s;ant, nor u&s;eful to the body, as the knowledge of the truth is to the &s;oul.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel brings near <HI>comfort for all that mourn;</HI> it is &s;aid of Chri&s;t that he is anointed "to comfort all that mourn, to appoint unto them
<PB N="101" REF="018314_0100_0FA5C6012B0C0CD0">
that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for a&s;hes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of prai&s;e for the &s;pirit of heavine&s;s." Chri&s;t &s;ays, in that never enough admired &s;ermon on the mount, "Ble&s;&s;ed are they that mourn, for they &s;hall be comforted." Mourning in its own na|ture is good for the &s;oul, as it tends to hinder the rank weeds of pride and vanity from &s;pringing up; and for this rea&s;on it is that Solomon &s;ays, "It is better to go to the hou&s;e of mourning, than to go to the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting; &s;orrow is better than laughter; for by the &s;adne&s;s of the countenance the heart is made better; the heart of the wi&s;e is in the hou&s;e of mourn|ing; but the heart of fools is in the hou&s;e of mirth." But the mourn|ing that is mo&s;t commended in &s;crip|ture, is a mourning for &s;in, as it is again&s;t a holy God, and as it has pierced the Saviour, and wounded the &s;oul; thus it is &s;aid, "But they
<PB N="102" REF="018314_0101_0FA5C603620296B8">
that e&s;cape of them &s;hall e&s;cape, and &s;hall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniqui|ty; and I will pour upon the hou&s;e of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem, the &s;pirit of grace and of &s;upplications; and they &s;hall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they &s;hall mourn for him, as one mourneth for an only &s;on, and &s;hall be in bitterne&s;s for him, as one that is in bitterne&s;s for his fir&s;t born. In that day &s;hall there be a great mourn|ing in Jeru&s;alem; and the land &s;hall mourn, every family apart; all the families that remain, every family apart and their wives apart." Now the go&s;pel proclaims and brings near comfort for &s;uch as the&s;e; "Com|fort ye, comfort ye my people, &s;aith your God; &s;peak ye comfortably to Jeru&s;alem, and cry unto her, that her iniquity is pardoned." And we read in Ezekiel's prophe&s;y where the
<PB N="103" REF="018314_0102_0FA5C6038CD8B628">
Lord &s;aid, "Go through the mid&s;t of the city, through the mid&s;t of Jeru&s;alem, and &s;et a mark upon the foreheads of the men that &s;igh, and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the mid&s;t thereof." Thus the mourners are pre&s;erved and com|forted, for Chri&s;t &s;ays, "Ble&s;&s;ed are ye that weep now; for ye &s;hall laugh; wo unto you that laugh now, for ye &s;hall mourn and weep". All men mu&s;t have a &s;ea&s;on for mourning, becau&s;e of their &s;ins, and happy are they who mourn in time, for they &s;hall rejoice during tho&s;e long ages of mourning, in which tho&s;e that laugh now &s;hall la|ment, with bitter "weeping, wailing, and gna&s;hing of teeth." Tho&s;e who now &s;orrow after a godly &s;ort do well; "For godly &s;orrow worketh repent|ance to &s;alvation, not to be repented of;" &s;uch who thus mourn, &s;hall have their con&s;olation abound. The mourn|ing church is frequently comforted in &s;cripture with &s;uch gracious promi&s;es
<PB N="104" REF="018314_0103_0FA5C605170C0640">
as the&s;e, "The ran&s;omed of the LORD &s;hall return, and come to Zion with &s;ongs, and everla&s;ting joy upon their heads; they &s;hall obtain joy and gladne&s;s; and &s;orrow and &s;ighing &s;hall flee away; for the Lord &s;hall be thine everla&s;ting light; and the days of thy mourning &s;hall be ended." Yea there are &s;ome pro|mi&s;es of comfort to all mankind, but not till they have had their &s;ea&s;on of wailing and lamentation, which all fallen creatures mu&s;t have before they can be the &s;ubjects of that com|fort which the go&s;pel brings; and a dreadful &s;ea&s;on of woe and mourning there mu&s;t be for the rebellious, be|fore the Lord "will &s;wallow up death in victory, and wipe away tears from off all faces;" but a period will certainly come when "God &s;hall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there &s;hall be no more death, neither &s;orrow, nor crying, neither &s;hall there be any more pain." Thus
<PB N="105" REF="018314_0104_0FA5C60693039978">
in the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of the words, the go&s;pel brings near <HI>comfort for all that mourn.</HI></P>
<P>So we have &s;een that the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is a bundle of GOOD NEWS; and a RICH TREASURE &s;ufficient to &s;upply all our wants; "But we have this trea&s;ure in earthen ve&s;&s;els, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us." The go&s;pel, viewed in all the&s;e points of light, appears to be a mo&s;t glori|ous di&s;pen&s;ation of grace, well cal|culated for the glory of God, the de|&s;truction of Satan's kingdom, and the welfare of mankind; and is &s;o excellent that we have no rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of it.</P>
<P><HI>Here this &s;ermon may be properly di|vided.</HI></P>
<P>I Come, &s;econdly, to &s;hew what St. Paul meant by not being a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="018314_0105_0FA5C6073448B848">
I. He was not a&s;hamed to believe it as a man; the go&s;pel contains no|thing that any need be a&s;hamed to believe; nothing unju&s;t, unrea&s;on|able, mean or trifling; nothing un|worthy of a God, nor contrary to his plan of moral government; neither does it make void his law, but e&s;tab|li&s;hes it.</P>
<P>And is not the de&s;cription of the go&s;pel here given, worthy to be be|lieved by every rational creature?</P>
<P>Need any one be a&s;hamed to be|lieve a plan &s;o calculated for the glo|ry of God, and the good of man|kind?

If not, we have no rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of believing it.</P>
<P>II. St. Paul was not a&s;hamed to profe&s;s, and confe&s;s it as a Chri&s;tian; he was not a&s;hamed to confe&s;s his dear Saviour before men; he wit|ne&s;&s;ed

He was never a&s;hamed to confe&s;s his re|ligion (which the Jews called here&s;y) plainly and publicly; he chearfully &s;ubmitted to be baptized at the bid|ding of Ananias, and thereby made an open profe&s;&s;ion of that faith which he before had per&s;ecuted, and &s;ought to de&s;troy; and to the day of his death he adorned the doctrine of God his Saviour, in all things. Let us imitate him in this re&s;pect, and let us not be a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel before mankind, but be willing to confe&s;s with the mouth what we be|lieve with the heart; "for with the heart man believeth unto righteou&s;|ne&s;s; and with the mouth confe&s;&s;ion is made unto &s;alvation."</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="018314_0107_0FA5C608CB7067E0">
III. St. Paul was not a&s;hamed to preach it as a mini&s;ter; and in this &s;en&s;e more e&s;pecially he &s;peaks in the words of my text, that he was not a&s;hamed of it; that is, that having believed it him&s;elf, he was not a|&s;hamed to proclaim it to others; and even to tho&s;e at Rome, where he might expect the greate&s;t oppo&s;ition. From the time of his conver&s;ion he began to preach the go&s;pel, and con|tinued in the work &s;teadily to his death; and was perhaps the greate&s;t, mo&s;t faithful and &s;ucce&s;sful preacher that ever was, or ever will be till Chri&s;t &s;hall come; he him&s;elf &s;ays, "I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me." Yea he &s;ays to the Romans, "From Jeru&s;alem and round about unto Illyricum I have fully preached the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t." And &s;peaking to the elders of the church of Ephe&s;us he &s;ays, "The Holy Gho&s;t witne&s;&s;eth in
<PB N="109" REF="018314_0108_0FA5C6096CDBA480">
every city, &s;aying, that bonds and afflictions abide me; but none of the&s;e things move me, neither count I my life dear unto my&s;elf, &s;o that I might fini&s;h my cour&s;e with joy, and the mini&s;try which I have received of the Lord Je&s;us, to te&s;tify the go&s;|pel of the grace of God."</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t tran&s;cribe a con&s;ider|able part of the New Te&s;tament, if I would give a full account of the la|bours of this faithful &s;ervant of Chri&s;t. Pa&s;&s;ages enough have been mentioned to &s;how that he was &s;o far from being a&s;hamed to preach the go&s;pel, that he gloried and rejoiced exceedingly in proclaiming the free grace of God to mankind, both by word and by writing. Mo&s;t of the fir&s;t gentile churches were planted by him, his &s;ermons doubtle&s;s were the means of converting many thou|&s;ands, and his writings have convey|ed the go&s;pel which he preached down to this generation, and will to
<PB N="110" REF="018314_0109_0FA5C60A3790DE68">
all &s;ucceeding ages, till time &s;hall be no more. Thus it appears that he was not a&s;hamed to preach the go&s;|pel; neither ought any of the mi|ni&s;ters of Chri&s;t to be a&s;hamed or afraid boldly to te&s;tify (according to the mea&s;ure given unto them) this good news of &s;alvation, to mankind of every rank and cla&s;s.</P>
<P>IV. St. Paul was not a&s;hamed to contend for it as a good &s;oldier of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t; and perhaps that was his meaning when he &s;ays, "If after the manner of men I have fought with bea&s;ts at Ephe&s;us, what advantageth it me, if the dead ri&s;e not?" It is likely that he met with great oppo|&s;ition at Ephe&s;us, where he abode and preached three years, from men &s;o rude and unrea&s;onable that they might be ju&s;tly compared to bea&s;ts. He de&s;ired the The&s;&s;alonians to pray that the apo&s;tles might "be deli|vered from unrea&s;onable and wicked men; for all men have not faith."
<PB N="111" REF="018314_0110_0FA5C60AEFF757B8">
Tho&s;e who deny the go&s;pel, and re|fu&s;e to believe divine revelation, pre|tend to be led by rea&s;on, but they are commonly the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable and wicked of mankind; and there is no doubt but Paul often had to contend with &s;uch. He contended and di&s;puted with tho&s;e who &s;ought to force the Gentile converts to con|form to the cu&s;toms of the Jews; he once even with&s;tood Peter "to the face; becau&s;e he was to be blamed;" and he &s;ays of tho&s;e who came in pri|vily to &s;py out their liberty which they had in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, "To whom we gave place by &s;ubjection, no not for an hour, that the truth of the go&s;|pel might continue with you," mean|ing the Galatians.</P>
<P>St. Paul contended with Jews and Greeks, with the philo&s;ophers of all &s;ects, with the Judaizing teachers, with both open and &s;ecret enemies, with "principalities," and "pow|ers," and "the rulers of the dark|ne&s;s
<PB N="112" REF="018314_0111_0FA5C60BB21CA0E8">
of this world." But though he had &s;o many to contend with, yet he came off a conqueror, yea and more than a conqueror, through Je|&s;us Chri&s;t; and no wonder, for he &s;ays, "So fight I, not as one that beateth the air; for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but migh|ty through God, to the pulling down of &s;trong holds; ca&s;ting down ima|ginations, and every high thing that exalteth it&s;elf again&s;t the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>St. Paul pur&s;ued his enemies &s;o well with the&s;e weapons, that he could &s;ay at la&s;t, "I have fought the good fight, I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e, I have kept the faith;" and as he had done, &s;o he exhorted Timothy, &s;aying, "Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life; thou therefore endure hardne&s;s, as a good &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t." Thus we

&s;ee that the ble&s;&s;ed apo&s;tle gloried in being "&s;et for the defence of the go&s;pel;" and we ought none of us to be a&s;hamed "earne&s;tly to contend for the faith which was once deliver|ed unto the &s;aints;" but let us re|member that "if a man al&s;o &s;trive for ma&s;teries, yet is he not crowned except he &s;trive lawfully;" we are exhorted to "&s;tand fa&s;t in one &s;pirit, with one mind, &s;triving together for the faith of the go&s;pel;" but let us always remember to &s;peak "the truth in love," and avoid contentions, and &s;trifes "about words to no profit, but to the &s;ubverting of the hearers;" yet let us never be a&s;hamed, when called, to contend for the go&s;pel, as good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>

only give a few extracts out of his own writings upon it, and which he was obliged to mention, in order to &s;ilence the many groundle&s;s cavils, and in&s;inuations u&s;ed again&s;t him by fal&s;e teachers; or &s;ometimes for the encouragement of tho&s;e to whom he wrote. Fir&s;t of all I &s;hall mention a pa&s;&s;age in which he includes the apo&s;tles in general, but which applies in a &s;pecial manner to him&s;elf; he &s;ays to the Corinthians, "For I think that God hath &s;et forth us the apo&s;tles la&s;t, as it were appointed to death, for we are made a &s;pectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men; we are fools for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, but ye are wi&s;e in Chri&s;t; we are weak, but ye are &s;trong, ye are honorable, but we are de&s;pi&s;ed: even unto this pre|&s;ent hour, we both hunger and thir&s;t, and are naked, and are buffetted, and have no certain dwelling place; and labour working with our own hands; being reviled we ble&s;s, being

<P>All this he &s;aith of the apo&s;tles, in|cluding him&s;elf; of him&s;elf alone he &s;aith (when compelled thereto by the Corinthians and the fal&s;e teach|ers) "Are they mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t?

I take plea&s;ure in infirmities, in reproaches, in nece&s;|&s;ities, in per&s;ecutions, in di&s;tre&s;&s;es for Chri&s;t's &s;ake."</P>
<P>We have &s;een already that his &s;uf|ferings for the go&s;pel's &s;ake were very great. Let us now &s;ee whether he was a&s;hamed of them, or not; and for this purpo&s;e we mu&s;t exa|mine &s;ome more of his epi&s;tles, and we &s;hall find that <HI>he gloried in them.</HI></P>
<P>To the Galatians he &s;ays, "But God forbid that I &s;hould glory &s;ave in the cro&s;s of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world; I am
<PB N="118" REF="018314_0117_0FA5C61407E14DB0">
crucified with Chri&s;t; from hence|forth let no man trouble me; for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Je&s;us;" which probably were the marks of the whippings he had received for Chri&s;t's &s;ake.</P>
<P>To the Ephe&s;ians he calls him&s;elf "Paul the pri&s;oner of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the Gentiles;" thereby glorying in the very name of "pri&s;oner" for the go&s;pel's &s;ake.</P>
<P>To the Philippians he declared that he had an earne&s;t expectation, and a hope, that in nothing he &s;hould be a&s;hamed, but that with all bold|ne&s;s, as always, &s;o at that time Chri&s;t &s;hould be magnified in his body, whether by life or by death; and he &s;ays, "For unto you it is given in the behalf of Chri&s;t, not only to believe on him, but al&s;o to &s;uffer for his &s;ake; having the &s;ame conflict, which ye &s;aw in me, and now hear to be in me; and if I be offered upon the &s;acrifice and &s;ervice
<PB N="119" REF="018314_0118_0FA5C614ADE680E8">
of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. I know both how to be aba&s;ed, and I know how to abound; every where and in all things I am in&s;tructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to &s;uf|fer need, for I have learned in what|&s;oever &s;tate I am, therewith to be content."</P>
<P>To the Colo&s;&s;ians he &s;ays, "I Paul am made a mini&s;ter; who now rejoice in my &s;ufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Chri&s;t in my fle&s;h, for his body's &s;ake, which is the church." And he de&s;ires their prayers, "That God would open a door of utter|ance, to &s;peak the my&s;tery of Chri&s;t, for which I am al&s;o in bonds," &s;aith he. And at the clo&s;e of his epi&s;tle he &s;aith, "Remember my bonds." Thus it is evident that he was not a&s;hamed of them him&s;elf. To the The&s;&s;alonians he &s;ays, "But even after that we had &s;uffered before,
<PB N="120" REF="018314_0119_0FA5C6156EB25C68">
and were &s;hamefully intreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God, to &s;peak unto you the go&s;|pel of God with much contention." Thus it appears that he was not di&s;couraged at all. In his fir&s;t epi&s;tle to Timothy he declares, that they &s;uffered for believing <HI>univer&s;al &s;al|vation,</HI> for he &s;ays, "This is a faith|ful &s;aying, and worthy of all accep|tation; for therefore we both la|bour, and &s;uffer reproach, becau&s;e we tru&s;t in the living God, who is the &s;aviour of all men, &s;pecially of tho&s;e that believe; the&s;e things com|mand and teach." Paul tells the Hebrews that they had compa&s;&s;ion of him in his bonds; and he ex|pected Philemon to hearken to his entreaty the more for his "being &s;uch an one as Paul the aged, and now al&s;o a pri&s;oner of Je&s;us Chri&s;t;" and he begins his epi&s;tle in a differ|ent manner from any other, with the&s;e words, "Paul a pri&s;oner of
<PB N="121" REF="018314_0120_0FA5C616438611B0">
Je&s;us Chri&s;t;" and he be&s;eeches him for one One&s;imus, whom he had be|gotten in his bonds; thereby glory|ing in them as honorable. In his epi&s;tle to the Romans he &s;ays, "For I reckon that the &s;ufferings of this pre&s;ent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which &s;hall be revealed in us."</P>
<P>But of all his epi&s;tles, the &s;econd to Timothy, wrote a little before his death (and which was perhaps the la&s;t he wrote) mo&s;t de&s;erves our con&s;ideration, under this head, for therein he declares his &s;ufferings for the go&s;pel, and his boldne&s;s in the &s;ame, in a very particular manner. He &s;ays to Timothy, "Be not thou therefore a&s;hamed of the te&s;timony of our Lord, nor of me his pri&s;oner; but be thou partaker of the afflic|tions of the go&s;pel, according to the power of God; for the which cau&s;e (even for the go&s;pel's &s;ake) I al&s;o &s;uffer the&s;e things; neverthele&s;s
<PB N="122" REF="018314_0121_0FA5C6171017F308">
I am not a&s;hamed; for I know in whom I have believed, and I am per&s;uaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him again&s;t that day." It was no &s;mall part of Paul's &s;ufferings that his friends for&s;ook him; of this he &s;eems to complain mo&s;t; this he mentions to Timothy, &s;aying, "This thou knowe&s;t, that all they which are in A&s;ia are turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermo|genes. Demas hath for&s;aken me, having loved this pre&s;ent world: at my fir&s;t an&s;wer no man &s;tood with me, but all men for&s;ook me; I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge." The&s;e were grievous &s;uf|ferings. While he is upon this &s;ub|ject, he mentions, with great re&s;pect and gratitude, a per&s;on of another &s;pirit, &s;aying, "The Lord give mercy unto the hou&s;e of One&s;ipho|rus; for he oft refre&s;hed me, and was not a&s;hamed of my chain; but
<PB N="123" REF="018314_0122_0FA5C617B2B70458">
when he was in Rome he &s;ought me out very diligently, and found me; the Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day; and in how many things he mini&s;|tered unto me at Ephe&s;us, thou knowe&s;t very well."</P>
<P>This man's kindne&s;s was abun|dantly repaid by the prayer which the apo&s;tle made for him, and which without doubt was an&s;wered.</P>
<P>St. Paul goes on to exhort Timo|thy to "be &s;trong in the grace which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us;" and &s;ays, "Re|member that Je&s;us Chri&s;t of the &s;eed of David was rai&s;ed from the dead, according to my go&s;pel; wherein I &s;uffer trouble as an evil doer, even unto bonds, but the word of God is not bound; therefore I endure all things for the elect's &s;akes, that they may al&s;o obtain the &s;alvation which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us with eter|nal glory; it is a faithful &s;aying; for if we be dead with him, we &s;hall al&s;o live with him; if we &s;uffer
<PB N="124" REF="018314_0123_0FA5C618F05A5778">
with him, we &s;hall al&s;o reign with him; if we deny him, he al&s;o will deny us; if we believe not, he abideth faithful; he cannot deny him&s;elf: But thou ha&s;t fully known my doctrine, manner of life, pur|po&s;e, faith, long &s;uffering, charity, patience, per&s;ecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Ly&s;tra; what per&s;ecu|tions I endured; but out of them all the Lord delivered me; yea and all that will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us &s;hall &s;uffer per&s;ecution."</P>
<P>Thus I have con&s;idered Paul's &s;uf|ferings for the go&s;pel, &s;o far as he has mentioned them, but there is one &s;cene of which he could not write, even his <HI>death,</HI> and which I &s;uppo&s;e happened &s;oon after he wrote this epi&s;tle; but for this great change he was well prepared. Happy Paul! Oh, who would not rather envy his &s;itu|ation than that of the greate&s;t mo|narch or conqueror on earth? With what calmne&s;s did he meet his ap|proaching
<PB N="125" REF="018314_0124_0FA5C61967E8D7B8">
fate! Hear his dying &s;ong! Oh, could we make it our own! "For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand; I have fought the good fight, I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord the righteous judge &s;hall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them al&s;o that love his appearing." Thus we &s;ee St. Paul was not a&s;hamed to &s;uffer for the go&s;pel as a martyr; and why &s;hould we be a&s;hamed to &s;uffer &s;ome little reproaches and deri&s;ions for its &s;ake?</P>
<P>Let us remember &s;uch a &s;hining example as his, and be followers of him, as he was of Chri&s;t. And let us remember St. Peter's exhortation, who &s;ays, "Fora&s;much then as Chri&s;t hath &s;uffered for us in the fle&s;h, arm your&s;elves likewi&s;e with the &s;ame mind; for he that hath &s;uffered in the

<P>Having thus far con&s;idered my &s;ub|ject, I come, la&s;tly, to give the rea|&s;ons why none &s;hould be a&s;hamed of it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. The go&s;pel is GOOD NEWS, as has been &s;hewn at large; and men are not commonly a&s;hamed to proclaim good news; Solomon &s;ays, "As cold waters to a thir&s;ty &s;oul, &s;o is good news from a far coun|try;"
<PB N="127" REF="018314_0126_0FA5C61B70A362B0">
a man that hath cold water, is not a&s;hamed to carry it to one that thir&s;ts, for he expects that it will be gratefully received; &s;o a man the mo&s;t timorous, that hath good and acceptable news, is not a&s;hamed to proclaim it before the greate&s;t multi|tude. Tho&s;e who are known com|monly to bring good news, are ge|nerally well accepted in company; David &s;aid of Ahimaaz, "He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings;" they who have common good news are bold; and why &s;hould any be a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel, &s;ince it is the be&s;t news that ever was, or ever can be proclaimed to men? It is good news from heaven, and con|tains more glad tidings than can be found be&s;ides, in all the words or writings that ever were, or ever &s;hall be &s;poke or written, from the fall of man to the end of time; and there|fore none need be a&s;hamed of it, in any &s;en&s;e that has been, or that might have been mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="018314_0127_0FA5C61D4B1E7F20">
Second. Another rea&s;on is, that it is the GOSPEL OF CHRIST, and therefore we &s;hould not be a&s;hamed of it; it proclaims him in all his offices, and in all his media|torial fulne&s;s, as the complete &s;a|viour of all; and we ought never to be a&s;hamed of any thing that tends to repre&s;ent Chri&s;t and his &s;alvation in an agreeable and beautiful light to mankind, which the go&s;pel certainly does.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t was not a&s;hamed to be born for us in a &s;table, and to be laid in a manger, to be a poor de&s;titute child, and a de&s;pi&s;ed man, to be without a place "where to lay his head," to be tempted, ridiculed, reproached, be|lied, bla&s;phemed, mocked, whip|ped, &s;pit upon, crowned with thorns, buffetted, blindfolded, accu&s;ed of bla&s;phemy and trea&s;on, treated as a fool, as the greate&s;t &s;inner (a rob|ber and murderer being preferred or cho&s;en before him) and to crown
<PB N="129" REF="018314_0128_0FA5C61E7B8B8F90">
the whole, made to bear his cro&s;s, &s;tripped intirely naked, and nailed thereto, then rai&s;ed up between the heavens and earth, as unworthy of either, between two thieves, as being the greate&s;t criminal, though per|fectly innocent; there naked was he expo&s;ed upon the cro&s;s, before the great multitude gathered to the fea&s;t; his dying agonies were made the &s;ub|ject of laughter, and the bittere&s;t ri|dicule, his thir&s;t was mocked with gall and vinegar, his per&s;on, mi|racles, and prophe&s;ies, were &s;corned, contemned, and treated with &s;coffs, &s;neers, di&s;dain, the vile&s;t bla&s;phe|mies, mo&s;t in&s;olent je&s;ts, and the mo&s;t cruel ironical &s;arca&s;ms. All this and much more he was not a&s;hamed to bear for us poor &s;inners. He "for the joy that was &s;et before him, endured the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ed the &s;hame; being found in fa&s;hion as a man, he humbled him&s;elf, and be|came obedient unto death, even the
<PB N="130" REF="018314_0129_0FA5C61F46FFBF80">
death of the cro&s;s;" the mo&s;t bit|ter, ignominious, and accur&s;ed of all deaths; and &s;hall we be a&s;hamed of him, his truths, ways, works, words, ordinances; and his religion, which is called "The Go&s;pel?" Shall we be a&s;hamed to believe, confe&s;s and profe&s;s, defend, proclaim, and &s;uffer for the &s;ame! Oh, let it never be &s;o among&s;t us! The go&s;pel may be called <HI>Chri&s;t'</HI>s, as it is <HI>of him,</HI> pro|claims him, and is proclaimed by his authority; and we ought never to be a&s;hamed of any thing belonging to our dear Saviour, &s;ince he was not a&s;hamed to die for us.</P>
<P>Third. Another rea&s;on why we &s;hould not be a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel is, that <HI>it is true and faithful;</HI> it is not only good news, re&s;pecting Chri&s;t and his &s;alvation, but it is true; other good news may prove fal&s;e, and he that proclaims it, and they who believe it, may be a&s;hamed; but "the &s;cripture &s;aith; Who&s;oever
<PB N="131" REF="018314_0130_0FA5C620124FE590">
believeth on him (meaning Chri&s;t) &s;hall not be a&s;hamed;" this truth is often repeated in &s;cripture; and we are farther told there, that "God willing more abundantly to &s;hew un|to the heirs of promi&s;e, the immu|tability of his coun&s;el, confirmed it by an oath; that by two immutable things, in which it was impo&s;&s;ible for God to lye, we might have a &s;trong con&s;olation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope &s;et before us; which hope we have as an anchor of the &s;oul, &s;ure and &s;ted|fa&s;t, and which entereth into that within the vail." So that it is evi|dent that we have a good foundation (for that "hope that maketh not a&s;hamed") even the word and oath of the great JEHOVAH; and let us remember that "the &s;trength of I&s;|rael will not lye, nor repent; for God is not a man that he &s;hould lye, nor the &s;on of a man that he &s;hould re|pent; hath he &s;aid, and &s;hall he not
<PB N="132" REF="018314_0131_0FA5C620B3460D88">
do it? o hath he &s;poken, and &s;hall he not make it good? yea let God be true, but every man a lyar. He that believeth not God, hath made him a lyar; becau&s;e he believeth not the record that God gave of his &s;on, and this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life; and this life is in his &s;on; he that hath received his te&s;timony, hath &s;et to his &s;eal that God is true." St. Paul &s;ays, "As God is true, our word to ward you was not yea and nay; for all the promi&s;es of God in him <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us. God is faith|ful, by whom ye were called unto the fellow&s;hip of his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord."</P>
<P>I tru&s;t that &s;ufficient pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture have been mentioned under each head in the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, to &s;how that they are founded upon the un|erring rule, the word of truth; and therefore we need not be a&s;hamed of
<PB N="133" REF="018314_0132_0FA5C6222C048248">
the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t &s;et forth there|in, &s;ince <HI>it is true.</HI> Truth never need to hide its head, for great it is, and &s;hall finally prevail; let us abide thereby, and it will abide by us.</P>
<P>Fourth. Another rea&s;on why we &s;hould not be a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is, that <HI>it is of infinite im|portance;</HI> it is not only <HI>good,</HI> and <HI>true,</HI> but contains matters of the <HI>greate&s;t moment and concern;</HI> in com|pari&s;on of which all the good news that ever was or ever will be pro|claimed, is light and trifling. What is it to hear of the birth of princes, compared to the glad tidings of the birth of the &s;on of God, the prince of peace, the &s;aviour of the world, the king of glory? What is it to hear or read of the brave, generous, heroic actions of the greate&s;t of men in any &s;tation, compared with the life and wondrous works of the &s;on of God while on earth? What is it to hear of the greate&s;t warlike
<PB N="134" REF="018314_0133_0FA5C62257C73C08">
atchievements, battles fought, victories won, triumphs obtained, nations de|&s;troyed, countries &s;ubdued, the found|ing and &s;ubverting of empires, the ri&s;e and fall of mighty &s;tates, king|doms, and monarchies, compared to the wonders of Chri&s;t's death, re&s;ur|rection, a&s;cen&s;ion, and glorification? He fought the mo&s;t dreadful of all battles, performed the mo&s;t glorious atchievements, obtained the greate&s;t victory and triumph, overturned the mighty empire of Satan, which he will at la&s;t intirely de&s;troy, and hath &s;et up his own, which will finally prevail over all; and he &s;hall not only de&s;troy his foes, but bring all that have rebelled again&s;t him, into a willing &s;ubjection to him again. What is it to hear of and po&s;&s;e&s;s tem|poral happine&s;s, peace, health, hap|pine&s;s, plenty, liberty, independence, free trade, increa&s;e of corn, wine, oyl, &s;ilver, gold, precious &s;tones, and riches in general, increa&s;e of learn|ing,
<PB N="135" REF="018314_0134_0FA5C62301C37638">
arts, &s;ciences, manufactures, &amp;c. compared to the glorious news which the go&s;pel proclaims, and the rich trea&s;ures and ble&s;&s;ings which it brings to mankind. The things of earth are fading and tran&s;ient; riches, ho|nours, plea&s;ures, friends, and all earthly enjoyments, may &s;oon leave us, or we them; not &s;o the things of God and Heaven, which are pro|claimed and brought nigh by the go&s;|pel of Chri&s;t; they are permanent and unfading, and when we come once fully to po&s;&s;e&s;s them, they never can be taken from us, nor we from them. The greate&s;t and mo&s;t perfect enjoyment of earthly things cannot &s;atisfy the &s;oul; but Chri&s;t and his &s;alvation can give &s;olid and never ending contentment. "The things that are &s;een are temporal, but the things which are not &s;een are eter|nal." As much as the &s;oul exceeds the body, and eternal ages exceed tran&s;ient moments, and the riches of

heaven tho&s;e of earth, of &s;o much more importance is the go&s;pel than all the good news be&s;ides, that ever was or that ever will be proclaimed to mankind; which is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on why we ought not to be a&s;hamed of it.</P>
<P>Fifth. Another rea&s;on why none ought to be a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel is, that it is not only <HI>of great impor|tance</HI> in it&s;elf, but <HI>concerns all man|kind.</HI> This can only be &s;aid of the univer&s;al everla&s;ting go&s;pel, for upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that Chri&s;t died only for a <HI>few,</HI> the go&s;pel cannot be &s;aid to be good news to <HI>all;</HI> but as it has been proved (if any thing can be proved) from &s;cripture, that Chri&s;t died for all without exception, and that all &s;hall be at la&s;t re&s;tored to God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and be|ing clean&s;ed in his blood, &s;hall be purged from all &s;in; it follows that the <HI>go&s;pel concerns all the children of
<PB N="137" REF="018314_0136_0FA5C62472A368D0">
men;</HI> which is a good rea&s;on why none &s;hould ever be a&s;hamed of it.</P>
<P>Sixth. Another rea&s;on (and indeed the very rea&s;on that the apo&s;tle gives) why none &s;hould be a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel is, that "<HI>it is the power of God unto &s;alvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew fir&s;t, and al&s;o to the Greek.</HI>"</P>
<P>Wherever the go&s;pel is received by faith into the heart, it works &s;uch a divine effect as &s;hows it to be the power of God; the &s;oul by its in|fluence is brought to renounce &s;in, the works of the fle&s;h, the world, the &s;ervice of Satan, &s;elf righteou&s;|ne&s;s, &s;elf love, and all things for Chri&s;t's &s;ake; and thus by being conformed to his image, enters into the &s;tate of &s;alvation. The change which the go&s;pel makes in the hearts of tho&s;e who believe, is great and glorious beyond de&s;cription; it cau&s;es them to hate &s;in, love holine&s;s, love the character of God, his laws, &amp;c.
<PB N="138" REF="018314_0137_0FA5C62546819A88">
It brings them to &s;ubmit to Chri&s;t, as their lord and king, their prophet, and prie&s;t. It turns "them from darkne&s;s to light, and from the pow|er of Satan unto God;" it heals them of their di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;upplies their wants in the manner that has been repre&s;ented; and thus produces &s;uch a change for the better in them, that we have no rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed of it. It has plea&s;ed God oftentimes to attend his word preached with ex|ceeding great power, whereby mul|titudes have been &s;uddenly turned to God; &s;uch was the ca&s;e when Peter preached on the day of Penteco&s;t, three thou&s;and were then added to the Lord, and to the church. The apo&s;tles had oftentimes great &s;ucce&s;s, "God bearing them witne&s;s with &s;igns, and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t; according to his own will;" and thus cau&s;ing them to triumph over all oppo&s;ition; for which cau&s;e they
<PB N="139" REF="018314_0138_0FA5C626CC8CD078">
were "not a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t," for they knew that the pow|er of God would attend the preach|ing of the &s;ame, and that it would work effectually in tho&s;e who believ|ed, even unto the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls, whether they were Jews (to whom the go&s;pel was fir&s;t ordered to be preached) or Gentiles; for "God is no re&s;pector of per&s;ons." The go&s;pel &s;hall finally bring all men to believe, and be the power of God to &s;alvation to them all; for God "worketh all things after the coun|&s;el of his own will;" and he "will have all men to be &s;aved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth; for there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us: who gave him|&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time." Wherefore &s;ince it is &s;o, we &s;hall never have any rea|&s;on to be a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="018314_0139_0FA5C6276BCC76A0">
Seventh. The la&s;t rea&s;on that I &s;hall mention is, that <HI>the go&s;pel is publi&s;hed by the highe&s;t authority;</HI> and therefore we need not be a&s;hamed of it. When we &s;ee any political news publi&s;hed by the authority of our rulers, we are not a&s;hamed to believe and report it; and we certainly ought to glory in the go&s;pel, &s;eeing it is proclaimed by the authority of him who &s;aid, "All power is given un|to me, in heaven and in earth; go ye therefore and teach all nations; go y&egrave; into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature. The LORD gave the word; great was the company of tho&s;e that publi&s;hed it;" and it is worthy to be pro|claimed from pole to pole; through every land and in every language; which God grant may &s;peedily be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Many other rea&s;ons might be given, and much more might be added upon this excel|lent &s;ubject, but what has been &s;aid is &s;uffici|ent to &s;how that <HI>we have no cau&s;e to be a&s;hamed of the</HI> GOSPEL OF CHRIST.</P>
