<HEAD>No. I.</HEAD>
<P>IT was to have been fore&s;een, that the Treaty which Mr. Jay was charged to negociate with Great-Britain, whenever it &s;hould ap|pear, would have to contend with many perver&s;e di&s;po&s;itions and &s;ome hone&s;t prejudices. That there was no mea&s;ure in which the government could engage &s;o little likely to be viewed according to its intrin&s;ic merits&mdash;&s;o very likely to encounter mi&s;conception, jea|lou&s;y, and unrea&s;onable di&s;like. For this many rea&s;ons my be a&s;|&s;igned.</P>
<P>It is only to know the vanity and vindictivene&s;s of human nature, to be convinced, that while this generation la&s;ts there will always exi&s;t among us, men irreconcilable to our pre&s;ent national con&s;titu|tion&mdash;embittered in their animo&s;ity, in proportion to the &s;ucce&s;s of its operation, and the di&s;appointment of their in u&s;picious predictions. It is a natural inference from this, that &s;uch men will watch with Lynx's eyes for opportunities of di&s;crediting the proceedings of the government, and will di&s;play a ho&s;tile and malignant zeal upon eve|ry occa&s;ion, where they think there are any prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the com|munity to favor their enterprizes. A treaty with Great-Britain was too fruitful an occa&s;ion not to call forth all their activity.</P>
<P>It is only to con&s;ult the hi&s;tory of nations to perceive, that every country at all times, is cur&s;ed by the exi&s;tence of men, who, actua|ted by an irregular ambition, &s;cruple nothing which they imagine will contribute to their own advancement and importance.&mdash;In mo|narchies, &s;upple courtiers, in republics, fawning or turbulent de|magogues, wor&s;hipping &s;till the idol power wherever placed, whe|ther in the hands of a prince, or of the people, and trafficking in the weakne&s;&s;es, vices, frailties, or prejudices of the one or the other. It was to have been expected, that &s;uch men, counting more on the pa&s;&s;ions than on the rea&s;on of their fellow citizens, and anticipating that the treaty would have to &s;truggle with prejudices, would be di&s;po&s;ed to make an alliance with popular di&s;content, to nouri&s;h it, and to pre&s;s it into the &s;ervice of their particular views.</P>
<P>It was not to have been doubted, that there would be one or more foreign powers indi&s;po&s;ed to a mea&s;ure which accommodated our differences with Great Britain, and laid the foundation of future good under&s;tanding, merely becau&s;e it had that effect.</P>
<P>Nations are never content to confine their rival&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ps and enmities to them&s;elves. It is their u&s;ual policy to di&s;&s;eminate them as wide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they can, regardle&s;s how far it may interfere with the tranqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|lity or happine&s;s of the nations which they are able to influence. Whatever preten&s;ions may be made, the world is yet remote from
<PB N="4" REF="028795_0004_0FDD499A6904F230">
the &s;pectacle of that ju&s;t and generous policy, whether in the cabi|nets of republics, or of kings, which would di&s;po&s;e one nation in its intercour&s;es with another, &s;atisfied with a due proportion of privi|leges and benefits, to &s;ee that others pur&s;ue freely, its true intere&s;t, with regard to a third; though at the expence of no engagement, nor in violation of any rule of friendly or fair procedure. It was natural that the contrary &s;pirit &s;hould produce efforts of foreign counteraction to the treaty, and it was certain that the partizans of the counteracting power would &s;econd its efforts by all the means which they thought calculated to an&s;wer the end.</P>
<P>It was known, that the re&s;entment produced by our revolution war with Great-Britain had never been entirely extingui&s;hed, and that recent injuries had rekindled the flame with additional violence. It was a natural con&s;equence of this that many &s;hould be declined to any amicable arrangement with Great-Britain, and that many others &s;hould be prepared to acquie&s;ce only in a treaty which &s;hould pre|&s;ent advantages of &s;o &s;triking and preponderant a kind, as it was not rea&s;onable to expect could be obtained, and as under the coercion of &s;uch a &s;ituation could have been, if obtained, but a &s;hort lived pre|lude of a &s;peedy rupture to get rid of them.</P>
<P>Unfortunately too the &s;uppo&s;ition of that &s;ituation has &s;erved to fo&s;ter exaggerated expectations, and the ab&s;urd delu&s;ion to this mo|ment prevails, notwith&s;tanding the plain evidence to the contrary, which is deducible from the high and haughty ground &s;till maintain|ed by Great-Britain again&s;t victorious France.</P>
<P>It was not to be mi&s;taken that an enthu&s;ia&s;m for France and her revolution throughout all its wonderful vici&s;&s;itudes has continued to po&s;&s;e&s;s the minds of the great body of the people of this country, and it was to be inferred, that this &s;entiment would predi&s;po&s;e to a jealou&s;y of any agreement or treaty with her mo&s;t per&s;evering com|petitor&mdash;a jealou&s;y &s;o exce&s;&s;ive as would give the fulle&s;t &s;cope to in&s;i|dious arts to perplex and mi&s;lead the public opinion. It was well un|der&s;tood, that a numerous party among us though di&s;avowing the de&s;ign, becau&s;e the avowal would defeat it, have been &s;teadily en|deavouring to make the United States a party in the pre&s;ent Euro|pean war, by advocating all tho&s;e mea&s;ures which would widen the breach between us and Great-Britain, and by re&s;i&s;ting all tho&s;e which could tend to clo&s;e it; and it was morally certain, that this party would eagerly improve every circum&s;tance which would &s;erve to ren|der the treaty odious, and to fru&s;trate it, as the mo&s;t effectual road to their favorite goal.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o known before hand that per&s;onal and party rival&s;hips of the mo&s;t active kind, would a&s;&s;ail whatever treaty might be made, to di&s;grace, if po&s;&s;ible, its organ.</P>
<P>There are three per&s;ons prominent in the public eye, as the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or of the actual Pre&s;ident of the United States in the event of his retreat from the &s;tation, Mr. Adams, Mr. Jay, Mr. Jeffer&s;on.</P>
<P>No one has forgotten the &s;y&s;tematic pains which have been taken to impair the well earned popularity of the fir&s;t gentleman. Mr. Jay too has been repeatedly the object of attacks with the &s;ame view. His friends as well as his enemies anticipated that he could make no treaty which would not furni&s;h weapons again&s;t him&mdash;and it were to have been ignorant of the indefatigable malice of his adver&s;aries
<PB N="5" REF="028795_0005_0FDD499BDFF39C78">
to have doubted they would be &s;eized with eagerne&s;s, and wielded with dexterity.</P>
<P>The peculiar circum&s;tances which have attended the two la&s;t elec|tions for governor of this &s;tate, have been of a nature to give the ut|mo&s;t keenne&s;s to party animo&s;ity. It was impo&s;&s;ible that Mr. Jay &s;hould be forgiven for his double, and in the la&s;t in&s;tance triumphant &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;or, that any promi&s;ing opportunity of detaching from him the public confidence &s;hould pa&s;s unimproved.</P>
<P>Trivial facts frequently throw light upon important de&s;igns. It is remarkable, that in the toa&s;ts given on the 4th of July, wherever there appears a direct or indirect cen&s;ure on the treaty, it is pretty uniformly coupled with compliments to Mr. Jerffer&s;on, and to our late governor Mr. Clinton, with an evident de&s;ign to place tho&s;e gentlemen in contra&s;t with Mr. Jay, and decrying him to elevate them. No one can be blind to the finger of party &s;pirit, vi&s;ible in the&s;e and &s;imilar tran&s;actions. It indicates to us clearly, one powerful &s;ource of oppo&s;ition to the treaty.</P>
<P>No man is without his per&s;onal enemies. Pre-eminence even in talents and virtue is a cau&s;e of envy and hatred of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. Bad men are the natural enemies of virtuous men. Good men &s;ometimes mi&s;take and di&s;like each other.</P>
<P>Upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion as the treaty, how could it happen other|wi&s;e, than <HI>per&s;onal enmity</HI> would be unu&s;ually bu&s;y, enterpri&s;ing and malignant?</P>
<P>From the combined operation of the&s;e different cau&s;es, it would have been a vain expectation that the treaty would be generally con|templated with candor and moderation, or that rea&s;on would regu|late the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions concerning it. It was certain on the contrary that however unexceptionable its true character might be, it would have to fight its way through a ma&s;s of unrea&s;onable oppo&s;ition; and that time, examination and reflection would be requi&s;ite to fix the public opinion on a true ba&s;is. It was certain that it would be|come the in&s;trument of a &s;y&s;tematic effort again&s;t the national govern|ment and its admini&s;tration; a decided engine of party to advance its own views at the hazard of the public peace, and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>The events which have already taken place, are a full comment on the&s;e po&s;itions. If the good &s;en&s;e of the people does not &s;peedily di&s;countenance the projects which are on foot, more melancholy proofs may &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>Before the treaty was known, attempts were made to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the public mind again&s;t it. It was ab&s;urdly a&s;&s;erted, that it was not expected by the people, that Mr. Jay was to make any treaty; as if he had been &s;ent, not to accommodate differences by negociation and agreement, but to dictate to Great-Britain the terms of an un|conditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Before it was publi&s;hed at large, a &s;ketch, calculated to produce fal&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, was handed out to the public through a medium noted for ho&s;tility, to the admini&s;tration of the government. Emi&s;|&s;aries flew through the country, &s;preading a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arm and di&s;content<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; the leaders of clu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s were every where active to &s;eize the pa&s;&s;ions of the citizens and pre-occupy their judgments again&s;t the treaty.</P>
<P>At Bo&s;ton it was publi&s;hed one day, and the next a town meeting was convened to condemn it; without ever being read, without any &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, &s;entence was pronounced again&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="028795_0006_0FDD499EC3985190">Will any man &s;eriou&s;ly believe that in &s;o &s;hort a time, an in&s;tru|ment of this nature could have been tolerably under&s;tood by the great|er part of tho&s;e who were thus induced to a condemnation of it? Can the re&s;ult be con&s;idered as any thing more than a &s;udden ebullition of popular pa&s;&s;ion, excited by the artifices of a party, which had adroitly &s;eized a favourable moment to &s;urprize the public opinion? This &s;pirit of precipitation and the intemperance which accompa|nied it, prevented the body of Merchants and the greate&s;t part of the mo&s;t con&s;iderate citizens from attending the meeting, and left tho&s;e who met, wholly under the guidance of a &s;et of men, who, with two or three exceptions, have been the uniform oppo&s;ers of the government.</P>
<P>The intelligence of this event had no &s;ooner reached New York, than the leaders of the clubs were &s;een haranguing in every corner of the city to &s;tir up our citizens into an imitation of the example of the Meeting at Bo&s;ton. An invitation to meet at the City Hall quick|ly followed, not to con&s;ider or di&s;cu&s;s the merits of the treaty, but to unite with the meeting at Bo&s;ton to addre&s;s the Pre&s;ident again&s;t its ratification.</P>
<P>This was immediately &s;ucceeded by a hand bill, full of invectives again&s;t the treaty as ab&s;urd as they were inflammatory, and mani|fe&s;tly de&s;igned to induce the citizens to &s;urrender their rea&s;on to the empire of their pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>In vain did a re&s;pectable meeting of the merchants endeavour, by their advice, to moderate the violence of the&s;e views, and to pro|mote a &s;pirit favourable to a fair dicu&s;&s;ion of the treaty; in vain did a re&s;pectable body of citizens of every de&s;cription, attend for that pur|po&s;e. The leaders of the clubs re&s;i&s;ted all di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and their fol|lowers, by their clamours and vociferations, rendered it impractica|ble, notwith&s;tanding the wi&s;h of a manife&s;t majority of the citizens convened upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Can we believe, that the leaders were really &s;incere in the objec|tions made to a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, or that the great and mixed ma&s;s of citi|zens then a&s;&s;embled had &s;o thoroughly ma&s;tered the merits of the treaty, as that they might not have been enlightened by &s;uch a di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted that the real motive to the oppo&s;ition, was the fear of a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; the de&s;ire of excluding light; the adherence to a plan of &s;urprize and deception. Nor need we de&s;ire any fuller proof of that &s;pirit of party which has &s;timulated the oppo&s;ition to the treaty, than is to be found in the circum&s;tances of that oppo|&s;ition.</P>
<P>To every man who is not an enemy to the national government, who is not a prejudiced partizan, who is capable of comprehending the argument, and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate enough to attend to it with impartia|lity, I flatter my&s;elf I &s;hall be able to demon&s;trate &s;atisfactorily in the cour&s;e of &s;ome &s;ucceeding papers&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. That the treaty adju&s;ts in a rea&s;onable manner the points in con|trover&s;y between the United States and Great Britain, as well tho&s;e depending on the inexecution of the treaty of peace, as tho&s;e grow|ing out of the pre&s;ent European war.</P>
<P N="2">2. That it makes no improper conce&s;&s;ions to Great Britain, no &s;a|crifices on the part of the United States.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="7" REF="028795_0007_0FDD49A035A71798">3. That it &s;ecures to the United States equivalents for what they grant.</P>
<P N="4">4 That it lays upon them no re&s;trictions which are incompatible with their honour or their intere&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">5. That in the articles which re&s;pect war, it conforms to the laws of nations.</P>
<P N="6">6. That it violates no treaty with, nor duty toward any foreign power.</P>
<P N="7">7. That compared with our other commercial treaties, it is upon the whole, entitled to a preference.</P>
<P N="8">8. That it contains conce&s;&s;ions of advantages by Great Britain to the United States, which no other nation has obtained from the &s;ame power.</P>
<P N="9">9. That it gives her no &s;uperiority of advantages over other nati|ons with whom we have treaties.</P>
<P N="10">10. That intere&s;ts of primary importance to our general welfare are promoted by it.</P>
<P N="11">11. That the too probable re&s;ult of a refu&s;al to ratify is war, or what would be &s;till wor&s;e, a di&s;graceful pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s under violations of our rights, unredre&s;&s;ed and unadju&s;ted; and con&s;equently, that it is the true intere&s;t of the United States, that the treaty &s;hould go into effect.</P>
<P>It will be under&s;tood, that I &s;peak of the treaty as advi&s;ed to be ratified by the Senate&mdash;for this is the true que&s;tion before the public.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>No. II.</HEAD>
<P>PREVIOUS to a more particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the merits of the treaty, it may be u&s;eful to advert to a &s;ugge&s;tion which has been thrown out, namely, that it was fore&s;een by many, that the mi&s;&s;ion to Great-Britain would produce no good re&s;ult, and that the event has corre&s;ponded with the anticipation.</P>
<P>The rever&s;e of this po&s;ition is manife&s;tly true.</P>
<P>All mu&s;t remember the very critical po&s;ture of this country at the time that mi&s;&s;ion was re&s;olved upon. A recent violation of our rights, too flagrant and too injurious to be &s;ubmitted to, had filled every American brea&s;t with indignation, and every prudent man with alarm and di&s;quietude. A few hoped, and the great body of the community &s;cared, that war was inevitable.</P>
<P>In this cri&s;is two &s;ets of opinions prevailed, one looked to mea&s;ures which were to have a compul&s;ory effect upon Great-Britain, the &s;e|que&s;tration of Briti&s;h debts, and the cutting off of intercour&s;e wholly or partially between the two countries; the other to <HI>vigorous prepa|rations</HI> for war and <HI>one more effort</HI> of negociation, under the &s;olemni|ty of an extraordinary mi&s;&s;ion, to avert it.</P>
<P>That the latter was the better opinion, no truly &s;en&s;ible man can doubt, and it may be boldly affirmed, that the event has entirely ju&s;tified it.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="028795_0008_0FDD49A1E044BE00">If mea&s;ures of coertion and repri&s;al had taken place, war in all human probability would have followed. National pride is gene|rally a very intractable thing. In the councils of no country does it act with greater force, than in tho&s;e of Great Britain. Whatever it might have been in her power to yield to negociation, &s;he could have yielded nothing to compul&s;ion, without &s;elf degradation, and without the &s;acrifice of that political con&s;equence which, at all times very important to a nation, was peculiarly &s;o to her at the juncture in que&s;tion. It &s;hould be remembered too, that from the relations in which the two countries have &s;tood to each other, it mu&s;t have co&s;t more to the pride of Great Britain to have received the law from us than from any other power.</P>
<P>When one nation has cau&s;e of complaint again&s;t another, the cour&s;e marked out by practice, the opinion of writers, and the prin|ciples of humanity, the object being to avoid war, is to precede re|pri&s;als of any kind, by a demand of reparation. To begin with repri|&s;als is to meet on the ground of war and puts the other party in a condition not to be able to recede without humiliation.</P>
<P>Had this cour&s;e been pur&s;ued by us, it would not only have ren|dered war morally certain, but it would have united the Briti&s;h nati|on in the vigorous &s;upport of their government, in the pro&s;ecution of it: while on our part, we &s;hould have been quickly di&s;tracted and divided. The calamities of war wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d have brought the mo&s;t ardent to their &s;en&s;es, and placed them among the fir&s;t in reproach|ing the government with precipitation, ra&s;hne&s;s and folly; for not having taken every chance by pacific means to avoid &s;o great an evil.</P>
<P>The example of Denmark and Sweden is cited in &s;upport of the coercive plan. Tho&s;e powers it is a&s;&s;erted, by arming and acting with vigour brought Great Britain to terms.</P>
<P>But who is able to tell us the preci&s;e cour&s;e of this tran&s;action, or the terms gained by it? Has it appeared that either Denmark or Sweden has obtained as much as we have done&mdash;a &s;tipulation of reparation for the violation of our property contrary to the laws of war?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, what did Denmark and Sweden do? They armed and they negociated. They did not begin by retaliations and repri&s;als. The United States al&s;o armed and negociated, and like Denmark and Sweden, prudently forebore repri&s;als. The conduct of the three countries agreed in principle, equally &s;teering clear of a precipitate re&s;ort to repri&s;als, and contradicting the doctrines and advice of our war party.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e pur&s;ued by our government was then in coincidence with the example of Denmark and Sweden&mdash;and it may be added was in every view the wi&s;e&s;t.</P>
<P>Few nations can have &s;tronger inducements than the United States to cultivate peace. Their infant &s;tate in general&mdash;their want of a marine in particular, to protect their commerce, would render war in an extreme degree, a calamity. It would not only arre&s;t our pre|&s;ent rapid progre&s;s to &s;trength and pro&s;perity, but would probably throw us back into a &s;tate of debility and impoveri&s;hment, from which it would require years to emerge. Our trade, navigation, and mercantile capital would be e&s;&s;entially de&s;troyed. Spain being an a&s;&s;ociate with Great Britain, a general Indian war might be expect|ed
<PB N="9" REF="028795_0009_0FDD49A6A718AAC0">
to de&s;olate the whole extent of our frontier&mdash;our exports ob&s;truct|ed agriculture would of cour&s;e langui&s;h; all other branches of indu&s;|try would proportionably &s;uffer; our public debt in&s;tead of a gra|dual diminution would &s;u&s;tain a great augmentation, and draw with it a large increa&s;e of taxes and burthens on the people.</P>
<P>But the&s;e evils however great, were perhaps, not the wor&s;t to be apprehended. It was to be feared that the war would be conducted in a &s;pirit which would render it more than ordinarily calamitous. There are too many proofs that a con&s;iderable party among us is deeply infected with tho&s;e horrid principles of Jacobini&s;m which proceeding from one exce&s;s to another have made France a theatre of blood, and which notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t vigorous efforts of the national repre&s;entation to &s;uppre&s;s it, keeps the de&s;tinies of that country &s;u&s;pended by a thread. It was too probable that the directi|on of the war, if commenced would have fallen into the hands of men of this de&s;cription. The con&s;equences of this, even in imagination, are &s;uch as to make any virtuous man &s;hudder.</P>
<P>It was therefore in a peculiar manner the duty of the government to take all po&s;&s;ible chances for avoiding war. The plan adopted was the only one which could claim this advantage.</P>
<P>To precipitate nothing, to gain time by negociation, was to leave the country in a &s;ituation to profit by any events which might turn up tending to re&s;train a &s;pirit of ho&s;tility in Great Britain, and to di&s;po&s;e her to rea&s;onable accommodation.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;&s;es of France which opportunely occurred, allowing them to have had an influence upon the i&s;&s;ue, &s;o far from di&s;paraging the merit of the plan which was pur&s;ued &s;erve to illu&s;trate its wi&s;dom. This was one of the chances which procra&s;tination gave, and one which it was natural to take into the calculation.</P>
<P>Had the rever&s;e been the ca&s;e, the po&s;ture of negociation was &s;till preferable to that of retaliation and repri&s;al; for in this ca&s;e, the triumphs of Great-Britain, the guantlet having been thrown by us, would have &s;timulated her to take it up without he&s;itation.</P>
<P>By taking the ground of negociation in the attitude of preparation for war, we at the &s;ame time carried the appeal to the prudence of the Briti&s;h cabinet, without wounding its pride, and to the ju&s;tice and intere&s;t of the Briti&s;h nation, without exciting feelings of re|&s;entment.</P>
<P>This conduct was calculated to range the public opinion of that country on our &s;ide, to oppo&s;e it to the indulgence of ho&s;tile views in the Cabinet, and in ca&s;e of war, to lay the foundation of &s;ci&s;m and di&s;&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>But one of the mo&s;t important advantages to be expected from the cour&s;e pur&s;ued, was the &s;ecuring of unanimity among our&s;elves, if, after all the pains taken to avoid war, it had been forced upon us.</P>
<P>As on the one hand, it was certain that di&s;&s;ention and di&s;content would have embarra&s;&s;ed and enfeebled our exertions in a war pro|duced by any circum&s;tance of intemperance in our public councils, or not endeavored to be prevented by all the milder expedients u&s;u|al in &s;imilar ca&s;es. So, on the other, it was equally certain, that our having ineffectually exhau&s;ted tho&s;e expedients, would cement us into a firm ma&s;s, keep us &s;teady and per&s;evering amid&s;t whatever vi&s;|&s;icitudes might happen, and nerve our efforts to the utmo&s;t extent of our re&s;ources.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="028795_0010_0FDD49A7B766C128">This union among our&s;elves, and di&s;union among our enemies, were ine&s;timable effects of the moderate plan, if it had promi&s;ed no other advantage.</P>
<P>But to gain time was of va&s;t moment to us in other &s;en&s;es. Not a &s;eaport of the United States was fortified, &s;o as to be protected again&s;t the in&s;ults of a &s;ingle frigate. Our magazines were in every re&s;pect too &s;cantily &s;upplied. It was highly de&s;irable to obviate the&s;e dif|ficiencies before matters came to extremity.</P>
<P>Moreover, the longer we kept out of the war, if obliged to go into it at la&s;t, the &s;horter would be the duration of the calamities incident to it.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances of the injury of which we more immediately complained afforded an additional rea&s;on for preceding repri&s;als by negociation. The order of the &s;ixth of November directed neutral ve&s;&s;els to be brought in for <HI>adjudication.</HI> This was an equivocal phra&s;e, and though there was too much cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect that it was intended to operate as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t did, yet there was a po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;con|&s;truction, and that po&s;&s;ibility was a rea&s;on in the nature of the thing for giving to the Briti&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vernment an opportunity of explaining before retaliations to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ace.</P>
<P>To all this it may be added, that one of the &s;ub&s;titutes for the plan pur&s;ued, the &s;eque&s;tration of debts, was a mea&s;ure no le&s;s di&s;hone&s;t than impolitie; as will be &s;hewn in the remarks which will be ap|plied to the tenth article of the treaty.</P>
<P>But is it unimportant to the real friends of republican govern|ment, that the plan pur&s;ued, was congenial with that pacific character which is a&s;cribed to it? Would it have been more de&s;irable that the government of our nation, out-&s;tripping the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> maxims of Europe, &s;hould, without a previous demand of reparation, have ru&s;hed into repri&s;als, and con&s;quently into war?</P>
<P>However this may be, it is a well a&s;certained fact, that our country never appeared &s;o augu&s;t and re&s;pectable as in the po&s;ition which it a&s;&s;umed upon this occa&s;ion. Europe was &s;truck with the digni|fied moderation of our conduct, and the character of our government and nation acquired a new elevation.</P>
<P>It cannot e&s;cape an attentive ob&s;erver, that the language, which in the fir&s;t in&s;tance condemned the mi&s;&s;ion of an Envoy extraordinary to Great-Britain, and which new condemns the treaty negociated by him, &s;eems to con&s;id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r the United States as among the fir&s;t rate pow|ers of the world in point of &s;trength and re&s;ource, and propo&s;es to them a conduct predicated upon that condition.</P>
<P>To under-rate our ju&s;t importance would be a degrading error. To over-rate it may lead to dangerous mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>A very powerful &s;tate may frequently hazard a high and haughty tone with good policy, but a weak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te can &s;carcely ever do it with|out imprudence. The la&s;t is yet our character, though we are the embryo of a great empi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e.

<P>It is not to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> this that we are to crouch to any power on earth, or ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly to &s;uffer our rights to be violated.&mdash;A

nation which is capable of this meanne&s;s, will quickly have no rights to protect, or honour to defend.</P>
<P>But the true inference is, that we ought not lightly to &s;eek or pro|voke a re&s;ort to arms; that in the differences between us and other nations we ought carefully to avoid mea&s;ures which tend to widen the breach; and that we &s;hould &s;crupulou&s;ly ab&s;tain from whatever may be con&s;trued into repri&s;als till after the fruitle&s;s employment of all amicable means has reduced it to a certainty that there is no al|ternative.</P>
<P>If we can avoid war for ten or twelve years more, we &s;hall then have acquired a maturity, which will make it no more than a com|mon calamity, and will authori&s;e us in our national di&s;cu&s;&s;ions to take a higher and more impo&s;ing tone.</P>
<P>This is a con&s;ideration of the greate&s;t weight to determine us to exert all our prudence and addre&s;s to keep out of war as long as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be po&s;&s;ible; to defer to a &s;tate of manhood a &s;truggle to which in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ancy is ill adapted.

<P>Should we be able to e&s;cape the &s;torm which at this juncture agi|tates Europe, our di&s;pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with Great-Britain terminated we may hope to po&s;tpone wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;tant period. This, at lea&s;t, will greatly dimini&s;h the chances of it. For then there will remain only one power with whom we have any embarra&s;&s;ing di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. I allude to Spain, and the que&s;tion of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi; and there is rea&s;on to hope that this que&s;tion by the natural progre&s;s of things, and per&s;e|verance in an amicable cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill finally be arranged to our &s;atisfac|on without the nece&s;&s;ity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>dernier re&s;ort.</HI></P>
<P>The allu&s;ion to this ca&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ts one or two important reflections.

<P>This policy is &s;o obvious, that it requires an extraordinary degree of infatuation not to be &s;en&s;ible of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and not to view with favor any mea&s;ure which tends to &s;o import<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a re&s;ult.</P>

<P>THE oppo&s;ers of the Treaty &s;eem to have put invention on the rack, to accumulate charges again&s;t it in a great number of ca&s;es, without regard even to plau&s;ibility. If we &s;uppo&s;e them &s;incere, we mu&s;t often pity their ignorance; if in&s;incere, we mu&s;t abhor the &s;pirit of deception which it betrays.&mdash;Of the prepo&s;terous nature of &s;ome of their charges, &s;pecimens will be given in the cour&s;e of the&s;e re|marks; though while nothing, which is colourable, will remain unat|tended to, it were endle&s;s to attempt a di&s;tinct refutation of all the wild and ab&s;urd things which are and will be &s;aid. It is vain to combat the vagaries of di&s;ea&s;ed imaginations. The mon&s;ters they engender are no &s;ooner de&s;troyed, then new legions &s;upply their pla|ces. Upon this, as upon all former occa&s;ions, the good &s;en&s;e of the people mu&s;t be relied upon, and it mu&s;t be taken for granted, that it will be &s;ufficient for their conviction to give &s;olid an&s;wers to all &s;uch objections as have the &s;emblance of rea&s;on; that now, as heretofore, they will maintain their character abroad and at home, for delibera|tion and reflection, and di&s;appoint tho&s;e who are in the habit of mak|ing experiments upon their credulity: who treating them as children, fancy that &s;ugar plumbs and toys will &s;uffice to gain their confidence and attachment and to lead them blindfold, whither&s;oever it is de|&s;ired.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering the treaty, it pre&s;ents it&s;elf under two principal heads; the permanent articles, which are the fir&s;t ten, and which, with &s;ome &s;upplementary provi&s;ions, adju&s;t the controverted points between the two countries; the temporary articles, which are all the remaining ones, and which e&s;tabli&s;h the principles of mutual inter|cour&s;e, as to <HI>general</HI> navigation and commerce. The manner of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion will corre&s;pond with this natural divi&s;ion of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>An objection meets the treaty at the thre&s;hhold. It is &s;aid that our envoy abandoned the ground which our government had uniformly held, and with it our rights and intere&s;ts as a nation, by acceding, in the preamble of the treaty, to the idea of terminating the differences between the two countries,
<Q>in &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a manner as without reference to the merits of their re&s;pective complaints and preten&s;ions, may
<PB N="13" REF="028795_0013_0FDD49AF49719A40">
be be&s;t calculated to produce mutual &s;atisfaction and good under|&s;tanding.</Q></P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved in &s;upport of this, that our government has con|&s;tantly charged the fir&s;t breaches of the treaty upon Great-Britain, in the two particulars of carrying away the negroes, and detaining the po&s;ts, that while the evacuation at New-York was going on, a demand of the &s;urrender of the negroes was made by Congre&s;s, through our Commander in Chief, which not being complied with, Commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;ent to a&s;certain the number carried away, with a view to claim a compen&s;ation; that early and repeated applicati|on were al&s;o made for the &s;urrender of the We&s;tern Po&s;ts, which not only was not done, but it is proved by the circum&s;tances, that orders were not given for it according to the true intent of the trea|ty, and that there was, from the beginning, a de&s;ign to intract, and a virtual infraction of the article with re&s;pect to this object; all this, it is alledged, has been the uniform language of our govern|ment, and has been demo&s;trated by Mr Jeffer&s;on to be true, in his letter to Mr. Hammond, of the 29th of May, 1792; and it is a&s;&s;ert|ed that the ground ought not to have been given up by Mr. Jay, becau&s;e it was the &s;tandard of the mutual rights and duties of the parties, as to the points unexecuted of the treaty of peace.</P>
<P>A proper examination of the&s;e matters is therefore called for, not only by the &s;pecific objection which is made to the principle which is contained in the preamble, but by the influence which a right &s;olu|tion is calculated to have, in giving a favorable or unfavorable com|plexion to the whole plan of the adju&s;tment.</P>
<P>It is true, as &s;ugge&s;ted, that our government has con&s;tantly charg|ed as breaches of the treaty by Great-Britain, the two particulars which have been &s;tated; but it is believed not to be true, that it has uniformly charged them as <HI>fir&s;t</HI> breaches of the treaty. Individuals may have entertained this idea. The &s;tate of Virginia &s;eems to have proceeded upon it in &s;ome public acts: but as far as is recollected; that ground was never formally or explicitly taken by the govern|ment of the United States, till in the above mentioned letter from Mr. Jeffer&s;on to Mr. Hammond, when, for the fir&s;t time, an attempt was made to vindicate or excu&s;e the whole conduct of this country, in regard to the treaty of peace, contrary, I will venture to &s;ay, to the general &s;en&s;e of well informed men.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;olemn act of our government on this head is an addre&s;s of Congre&s;s to the different States on the 13th of April, 1787.</P>
<P>This addre&s;s admits contraventions of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he treaty on our part, and in&s;tead of deriving either ju&s;tification of extenuation of them from prior infractions by Great-Britain, urges the different &s;tates to a repeal of all contravening laws.</P>
<P>But if the fact, in this re&s;pect, were admitted to be as &s;tated by the adver&s;aries of the treaty, it would not authori&s;e their conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>It would not follow, that, becau&s;e the ground had been taken by the government, it ought to have been pert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou&s;ly kept&mdash;if upon fair examination it had appeared to be not &s;olid, or if an adherence to it would have ob&s;tructed a rea&s;onable adju&s;tment of oifferences.</P>
<P>Nations no more than individuals ought to per&s;i&s;t in error e&s;pe|cially at the &s;acrifice of their peace and pro&s;perity; be&s;ides, nothing is more common in di&s;putes between nations, than for each &s;ide to charge

What &s;en|&s;ible man, what humane man will deny that a compromi&s;e, which &s;ecures &s;ub&s;tantially the objects of intere&s;t, is almo&s;t always prefera|ble to war, on &s;o punctilions and unmanageable a point?</P>
<P>Reject the principle of compromi&s;e, and the feuds of nations mu&s;t become much more deadly than they have heretofore been.

The earth now too often &s;tained, would then continually &s;tream with human gore.</P>
<P>From the &s;ituation of the thing, and of the parties, there never could be a rational doubt that the compromi&s;ing plan was the only one on which the United States and Great Britain could ever ter|minate their differences without war; that the que&s;tion, who was the fir&s;t delinquent, would have been an eternal bar to accommodati|on, and con&s;equently that a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of that que&s;tion was a pre-re|qui&s;ite to agreement. Had our envoy permitted the negociation to be arre&s;ted by ob&s;tinacy on this head, he would have &s;hewn him&s;elf to be the diplomatic pedant, rather than the able negociator, and would have been ju&s;tly chargeable with &s;acrificing to punctilio, the peace of his country. It was enough for him, as he did, to a&s;certain by a preliminary di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the impo&s;&s;ibility of bringing the other party to concede the point.</P>
<P>An impartial &s;urvey of the real &s;tate of the que&s;tion, will &s;atisfy candid and di&s;cerning men, that it was wi&s;e and politic to di&s;mi&s;s it. This &s;hall be attempted.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that two breaches of the treaty of peace are charged upon Great Britain; the carrying away of the negroes, and the detertion of the po&s;ts. It remains to inve&s;tigate the reality of the&s;e breaches, and to fix the periods when they can be &s;aid to have happened.</P>
<P>As to the negroes, the true &s;en&s;e of the article in the treaty of peace, which re&s;pects them is di&s;puted.</P>
<P>The words of the &s;tipulation are (Art. 7.) that "his Britannic Ma|je&s;ty &s;hall, with all convenient &s;peed, and without cau&s;ing any de|&s;truction or carrying away any negroes or other property of the Ame|rican inhabitants, withdraw all his armies, garri&s;ons and fleets, from the United States."</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="028795_0015_0FDD49B60ECD2F40">The&s;e terms admit of two con&s;tructions; one, that no negroes, or other articles, which <HI>had been</HI> American property &s;hould be car|ried away, the other, that the evacuations were to be made, <HI>without depredation,</HI> con&s;equently that no new de&s;truction was to be com|mitted, and that negroes or other articles, which at the time of the ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities, <HI>continued to be the property</HI> of American inhabi|tants, unchanged by the operations of war, &s;hould be foreborne to be carried away.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is the con&s;truction which was adopted by this country, the la&s;t is that in&s;i&s;ted upon by great Britain.</P>
<P>The arguments which &s;upport her con&s;truction are the&s;e;</P>
<P N="1">I. The e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of war give to an enemy the <HI>u&s;e</HI> and <HI>enjoy|ment,</HI> during the war, of <HI>real</HI> property, of which he obtains po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on, and the ab&s;olute owner&s;hip of all <HI>per&s;onal</HI> property which falls into his hands. The latter is called <HI>booty,</HI> and, except &s;hips, becomes ve&s;ted in the captors the moment they acquire a firm po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. With regard to &s;hips, it &s;eems to be a general rule of the marine law, that condemnation is nece&s;&s;ary to the complete inve&s;tment of the property in the captor.</P>
<P N="2">II. Negroes, by the laws of the States, in which &s;lavery is allow|ed, are per&s;onal property. They therefore, on the principle of tho&s;e laws, like hor&s;es, cattle, and other moveables, were liable to become booty&mdash;and belonged to the enemy as &s;oon as they came into his hands. Belonging to him, he was free either to apply them to his own u&s;e, or to &s;et them at liberty. If he did the latter, the grant was irrevocable, re&s;titution was impo&s;&s;ible. Nothing in the laws of na|tions, or in tho&s;e of Great Britain, will authori&s;e the re&s;umption of liberty, once granted to a human being.</P>
<P N="3">III. The negroes in que&s;tion were ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her taken in the cour&s;e of mi|litary operations, or they joined the Briti&s;h army upon invitation by proclamation. However di&s;honorable to Great Britain the latter may have been as an illiberal &s;pecies of warfare, there is no ground to &s;ay that the &s;trict rules of war did not warrant it, or that the effect was not in the one ca&s;e as well as in the other, a change of property in the thing.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The &s;tipulation relates to "negroes or <HI>other property</HI> of the <HI>American</HI> inhabitants;" putting negroes on the &s;ame &s;ooting with any other article. The characteri&s;tic of the &s;ubject of the &s;tipulation be|ing <HI>property</HI> of <HI>American</HI> inhabitants, whatever had lo&s;t that character could not be the object of the &s;tipulation. But the negroes in que&s;tion, by the laws of war, had lo&s;t that character; they were therefore not within the &s;tipulation.</P>
<P>Why did not the United States demand the &s;urrender of captured ve&s;&s;els, and of all other moveables which had fallen into the hands of the enemy? The an&s;wer is, becau&s;e common &s;en&s;e would have re|volted again&s;t &s;uch a con&s;truction. No one could believe that an in|definite &s;urrender of all the &s;poils or booty of a &s;even year's war was ever intended to be &s;tipulated; and yet the demand for a hor&s;e, or an ox, or a piece of furniture, would have been as comple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly within the terms "negroes and other property," as a negroe&mdash;con&s;equently the rea&s;oning which proves that one is not included, excludes the other.</P>
<P>The &s;ilence of the United States, as to every other article, is there|fore
<PB N="16" REF="028795_0016_0FDD49B791D1A540">
a virtual abandonment of that &s;en&s;e of the &s;tipulation which re|quires the &s;urrender of negroes.</P>
<P N="5">V. In the interpretation of treaties, things <HI>odious</HI> or <HI>immoral</HI> are not to be pre&s;umed. The abandonment of negroes, who had been in|duced to quit their ma&s;ters on the faith of official proclamations, promi&s;ing them liberty, to &s;ail again under the yoke of their ma&s;ters, and into &s;lavery, is as <HI>odious</HI> and <HI>immoral</HI> a thing as can be conceived. It is odious, not only as it impo&s;es an act of perfidy on one of the contracting parties; but as it tends to bring back to &s;ervitude, men once made free. The general intere&s;ts of humanity con&s;pire with the obligation which Great Britain had contracted toward the negroes, to repel this con&s;truction of the treaty, if another can be found</P>
<P N="6">VI. But another and le&s;s exceptionable con&s;truction is found in con|&s;idering the clau&s;e as in&s;erted, for greater caution, <HI>to &s;ecure evacuations without depr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dation.</HI> It may be an&s;wered, that this was &s;uperfluous, becau&s;e ho&s;tilies having cea&s;ed, the &s;tipulation to &s;urrender implied of it&s;elf, that it was to be done without depredation. But, to this the reply is, that a part of the clau&s;e man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fe&s;tly contemplates the ca&s;e of new depredations, and provides a guard again&s;t it, in the promi&s;e that the evacuations &s;hall be made without <HI>cau&s;ing any de&s;truction.</HI> To cau&s;e de&s;truction is to do &s;ome new act of v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olence. This reflection de&s;troys the argument drawn from the &s;uperfluou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;tipu|lation in the &s;en&s;e here given to it, and by &s;hewing that it mu&s;t have &s;uch a &s;en&s;e in one part, authori&s;es the conclu&s;ion, that the remain|der of the clau&s;e has a &s;imilar &s;en&s;e. The connection of the two things, as parts of one &s;entence, confirms this inference.</P>
<P><HI>The&s;e arguments certainly have great weight and do not admit of ea&s;y refutation. It is a fact too, that the opinions of &s;ome of the abl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t law|yers of our country have, from the beginning corre&s;ponded with the con|&s;truction they enforce.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is not enough for us to be per&s;uaded, that &s;ome of the negociators, who made the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ace, intended the article in our &s;en&s;e. It is nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be found in the in&s;trument it&s;elf, and from the nature of it, ought to have been expre&s;&s;ed with clearne&s;s and without ambiguity. If there be real ambiguity in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the odiou&s;ne&s;s of the effect will incline the &s;cale again&s;t us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It does not remove the difficulty to &s;ay, that compen&s;ation for the negroes might have been a &s;ub&s;titute for the thing.&mdash;When one party promi&s;es a &s;pecific thing to another, nothing but the thing it&s;elf will &s;atisfy the pro|mi&s;e. The party to whom it is made cannot be required to accept in lieu of it an equivalent. It follows, that compen&s;ation for the negroes would not have been a performance of the &s;tipulation to forbear to carry them away, and therefore, if there be any thing odious in the &s;pecific thing it&s;elf, the objection to the interpretation which requires it, is not done away by the idea of &s;ub&s;tituting compen&s;ation. For the article does not admit &s;uch &s;ub&s;titution, and its &s;en&s;e cannot be defined by what it does not admit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Some colour to our &s;en&s;e of the article re&s;ults from the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions in the &s;ame clau&s;e, "leaving in all the fortifications, the American artillery that may be therein." But this expre&s;&s;ion is not of equivalent force to that of</HI> property of American inhabitants. <HI>For example, &s;uppo&s;e an American &s;hip to have been captured and condemned, it might &s;till be &s;aid of her, in a certain &s;en&s;e, this is an "American &s;hip," alluding to the country of which &s;he had been the &s;hip, but it could not be &s;aid in any &s;en&s;e of her
<PB N="17" REF="028795_0017_0FDD49B8F57958A8">
this &s;hip is American</HI> property, <HI>or the</HI> property <HI>of American inhabi|tants. The country of which a thing was, may often be u&s;ed with aptne&s;s as a term of de&s;cription of that thing, though it may have changed own|ers; but the term</HI> property, <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ich is &s;ynonimous with</HI> owner&s;hip, <HI>can never be u&s;ed in the pre&s;ent ten&s;e as de&s;criptive of an owner&s;hip which has cea&s;ed. Moreover, if the expre&s;&s;ions in the two ca&s;es had been (as they are not) of equivalent force, it would n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t follow that they were to have the &s;ame meaning in both ca&s;es, being applied to different matters. For an odious con&s;equence in one in&s;tance would be a rea&s;on for rejecting a particular &s;en&s;e of a word or phra&s;e, which would be proper in another, to which no &s;uch con&s;equence was attached.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Let me now a&s;k this que&s;tion of any candid man. Is our con&s;truction of the article re&s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">g the negroes, &s;o much better &s;upported than that of Great-Britain, as to ju&s;tify our pronouncing with po&s;itivene&s;s that the carrying them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> was a breach of the treaty?</HI></P>
<P><HI>To me it appear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, that this mu&s;t be con&s;idered, &s;peaking favoura|bly for us, as a very doubtful point, and that we cannot with confidence predicate a breach of the treaty by Great Britain upon this event. If it was one it happened in May,</HI> 1783.</P>
<P><HI>The affair of the We&s;tern Po&s;ts is now to be examined; that the deten|tion of them, after the proper point of time for delivering them up, was a breach of the treaty, will not bear a di&s;pute. But what that proper time was, is a &s;erious que&s;tion between the parties.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Our government has contended, that the po&s;ts ought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ur|rendered with all convenient &s;peed after the provi&s;ional treaty took effect &mdash;And Mr. Jeffer&s;on, who is much cited on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, has &s;hown, by an ingenious and elaborate deduction of circum&s;tances, that this was not only not done, but never intended,</HI></P>
<P><HI>But Mr. Jeffer&s;on has not even di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the que&s;tion, whether the pro|vi&s;ional or the definitive treaty was the act from which the obligation to perform was to date. This is an important omi&s;&s;ion, for Great-Britain affirms the definitive treaty to be the criterion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As an original que&s;tion much might be &s;aid on both &s;ides. The natural relati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n of the terms</HI> provi&s;ional <HI>or</HI> preliminary <HI>and</HI> definitive <HI>&s;eems to exhibit the former as inchoate and imperfect, and to refer to the latter the conclu&s;ive obligatory force and legal perfection. There is room ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fore, to &s;ay, that all but the mere ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities, or for the execution of which there is no preci&s;e point of time fixed in preliminary articles, is referred to the definitive treaty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>On the other hand it may be argued, that a preliminary treaty is as much a national treaty as a definitive one both being made by an equal and the competent authority, and that there is no good rea&s;on why tho&s;e things which are &s;ufficiently regulated by the preliminar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;hould not go into immediate and complete effect, equally as if regulated by the definitive treaty, or why the latter &s;hould be con&s;idered as any thing more than an in&s;trument for adju&s;ting points which may have been left open by the pre|liminary articles, and for giving more perfect form. Accordingly, there are examples of preliminary treaties going into mutual and full execu|tion, though never followed by definitive treaties.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But, however this que&s;tion may have &s;tood on principle, the conduct of our government in the particular ca&s;e has &s;ettled it again&s;t us, and has com|pletely &s;anctioned the doctrine of Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If performance was to date from the provi&s;ional articles, this applies as
<PB N="18" REF="028795_0018_0FDD49BDEF3F46A0">
well to us as to Great Britain. It was incumbent upon Congre&s;s to have notified the treaty with the proper &s;olemnities to the different States and their citizens; to have made the recommendations &s;tipulated in the fifth article, &amp; to have enjoined the ob&s;ervance of all tho&s;e things which were promi&s;ed on our part. The nature of &s;ome of the&s;e &s;tipulations rendered it particularly urgent that no time &s;hould be lo&s;t. But all was deferred till afte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the ratification in this country of the definitive treaty. The</HI> 15<HI>th day of January,</HI> 1784, <HI>is the date of the act which attempts to car|ry the treaty into effect on our part. This then is a practical &s;ettlement by our&s;elves of the principle that performance was to date from the defini|tive treaty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is no objection to the po&s;ition, that our &s;eaports were previou&s;ly evacu|ated; that was matter of mutual co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">venien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &amp; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> done does not change the &s;tate of</HI> &s;trict obligation <HI>between the parties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ven in the view of liberal and conciliating procedure, the prompt &s;ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r of our &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a ports and that of the we&s;tern po&s;ts are for obvious rea&s;ons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry different things.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But our dilemma is this, if the delay of orders for evacuating the we&s;|tern po&s;ts, previous to the ratification of the definitive treaty, was on the part of Great-Britain a breach of treat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, our delay to act upon the points &s;tipulated by us till after that ratification, mu&s;t have been equally a breach of treaty; and it mu&s;t have been at lea&s;t co-temporary with any breach that could have been committed by Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We are compelled then by our own example to agree with Great-Bri|tain that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as not obliged to &s;urrender the we&s;tern po&s;ts till after the mutual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cation of the definitive treaty, and to abandon the &s;uper-&s;tructure, however &s;oothing to our wi&s;hes which has been reared upon a different foundation. If &s;o, we mu&s;t look to the period of the exchange of the ratifications in Europe for the date of the orders for evacuating. I have not in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion materials for fixing with accuracy that period, but con&s;idering the time of the ratification here, and the time of its proba|ble arrival in England, we are carried to the latter end of April or be|gining of May,</HI> 1784; <HI>&s;o that it is not till about May</HI> 1784, <HI>that we can charge upon Great Britain a delinquency as to the &s;urrender of the po&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Having now examined the nature of the infractions of the treaty of peace charged upon Great-Britain, with re&s;pect to dates, I &s;hall in the next number of this defence, trace &s;ome in&s;tances of infraction on our part.

<P>AN accurate enumeration of the breaches of the treaty of peace, on our part, would require a tedious re&s;earch. It will &s;uffice to &s;elect and quote a few of the mo&s;t prominent and early in&s;tances.</P>
<P>One of the earlie&s;t is to be found in an act of this &s;tate, for grant|ing a more effectual relief in ca&s;es of certain tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, pa&s;&s;ed the
<PB N="19" REF="028795_0019_0FDD49D033B53E60">
17th of March, 1783. This act takes away from any per&s;on (&s;ubjects of Great-Britain of every de&s;cription included) who had, during the war, occupied, injured, de&s;troyed, or received property, real or per|&s;onal, of any inhabitant without the Briti&s;h lines, the benefit of the plea of a military order: con&s;equently the ju&s;tification which the laws and u&s;ages of war give, and the immunity re&s;ulting from the re|ciprocal amne&s;ty, which expre&s;sly or virtually is an e&s;&s;ential part of every treaty of peace. To this it may be added, that it was con|&s;idered by Great Britain as a direct infraction of the 6th article of her treaty with us, which exempts all per&s;ons from pro&s;ecution "by rea|&s;on of the part they might have taken in the war."</P>
<P>Mr. Jeffer&s;on, not controverting the point that the provi&s;ions of this act were contrary to the treaty, endeavours to get rid of the inference from it, by alledging three things.&mdash;1&s;t. That it pa&s;&s;ed antecedently to the treaty, and &s;o could not be a violation of an act of &s;ub&s;equent date.&mdash;2d. That the treaty was paramount to the laws of the particular &s;tates, and operated a repeal of them.&mdash;3d. That the exceptionable principle of this act was never &s;anctioned by the courts of ju&s;tice, and in one in&s;tance (the ca&s;e of Rutgers, and Wad|dington in the Mayor's court) was over-ruled.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t point, it is &s;ufficient to an&s;wer, that the law conti|nued to operate, <HI>in fact</HI> from the time of the treaty till the 4th of April, 1787, when there was a repeal of the exceptionable clau&s;e, by an act of our legi&s;lature. During the period of four years, many &s;uits were brought and many recoveries had; extending even to per&s;ons who had been in the military &s;ervice of Great Britain.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd point, the&s;e ob&s;ervations may be oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The articles of confederation did not, like our pre&s;ent con&s;titution, declare that treaties were <HI>&s;upreme laws</HI> of the land. The United States, under that &s;y&s;tem, had no courts of their own to expound and enforce their treaties as laws. All was to depend on the com|parative authority of laws and treaties, in the judgment of the &s;tate courts.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion, whether treaties were paramount to, and a virtual repeal of antecedent laws, was a que&s;tion of theory, about which there was room for, and in this country did exi&s;t much diver&s;ity of opinion. It is notorious, that it has been &s;trenuou&s;ly maintained, that however a national treaty ought, in good faith, to be conclu&s;ive on a &s;tate, to induce a repeal of laws contrary to it, yet its actual laws could not be controverted by treaty, without an actual repeal by its own authority. This doctrine has been emphatically that of the party di&s;tingui&s;hed by its oppo&s;ition to national principles.</P>
<P>And it is ob&s;ervable that Congre&s;s, not relying entirely upon the force of the treaty, to abrogate contravening laws, in their addre&s;s already cited, urge the &s;tates to a repeal of tho&s;e laws. It is likewi&s;e ob&s;ervable in re&s;pect to the very act under con&s;ideration, that the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate, in April, 1787, thought a po&s;itive repeal of the exceptionable clau&s;e nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The complaints of a power, who&s;e treaty with us was, <HI>in fact,</HI> violated by the operation of a &s;tate law, could never be &s;atisfactorily an&s;wered by referring to a <HI>theoretic ab&s;tract di&s;puted</HI> propo&s;ition. Such a power might reply with irre&s;i&s;table force. It is not for us to concern our&s;elves about the &s;tructure or meaning of your political
<PB N="20" REF="028795_0020_0FDD49BEF44CBF88">
con&s;titutions, or the force of the legal maxims deducible from the forms and di&s;tributions of power which you have adopted for your government. It is <HI>the fact</HI> in which alone we are intere&s;ted&mdash;you have &s;tipulated <HI>this</HI> and <HI>that</HI> to us&mdash;your &s;tipulation in practice is contravened. It is your duty to &s;ee that there are no impediments from conflicting authorities within your&s;elves, to an exact fulfil|ment of your promi&s;es. If you &s;uffer any &s;uch impediment to exi&s;t, you are an&s;werable for the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>As to the third point, it is to be ob&s;erved that though there may have been no expre&s;s formal deci&s;ion of our courts, enforcing the exceptionable principle of the tre&s;pa&s;s act; yet there never was a deci&s;ion of a &s;uperior court again&s;t it: and it may not be ami&s;s to remark incidentally, that the deci&s;ion of the Mayor's court, from which Mr. Jeffer&s;on is glad to derive an exculpation of our conduct, was the object of a &s;evere animadver&s;ion at a popular meeting in this city, as a judiciary encroachment on the legi&s;lative authority of the &s;tate. The truth on this point is, that according to the prevailing opinion of our bar, a defence under a military order was de&s;perate, and it was believed that a majority of our &s;upreme court bench would overru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the plea. Hence in numerous ca&s;es where it might have been u&s;ed, it was waved; and the endeavour on behalf of the defen|dants was either to effect on collateral grounds, a mitigation of da|mages, or to accompli&s;h the be&s;t compromi&s;es that could be ob|tained; even the &s;uit of Rutgers and Waddington, after a partial &s;ucce&s;s in the Mayor's court, was terminated by a compromi&s;e, ac|cording to the advice of the defendant's council, owing to the ap|prehen&s;ion of an unfavourable i&s;&s;ue in the &s;upreme court; and this, notwith&s;tanding the defendant was a Briti&s;h &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances which are faithfully repre&s;ented, is it po&s;&s;ible to doubt that the act in que&s;tion operated a breach of our treaty with Great Britain? and this from the very commencement of its exi&s;tence? can we rea&s;onably expect that the nations with whom we have treaties will allow us to &s;ub&s;titute theoretic problems to performances of our engagements, and will be willing to accept them as apologies for actual violations?</P>
<P>It is pertinent to remark, that the Briti&s;h commander in chief, very early remon&s;trated again&s;t this act, but the remon&s;trance pro|duced no effect.</P>
<P>Another act of the &s;tate of New York may be cited as a violati|on of the treaty on our part, which mu&s;t have been nearly cotem|porary with that of the detention of the po&s;ts. Its date is the 12th of May, 1784: this act confirms, in expre&s;s terms, all confi&s;cations before made, notwith&s;tanding errors in the proceedings, and takes away the writ of error upon any judgment previou&s;ly rendered.</P>
<P>This was in &s;ub&s;tance, a new confi&s;cation; judgments which from error were invalid, were nullities. To take away the writ of error, by which their nullity might be e&s;tabli&s;hed, was to give them an efficacy which they did not before po&s;&s;e&s;s; and as to the operation, cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the rendering of new judgments. To make voidable acts of confi&s;cation, valid and conclu&s;ive, is equivalent to new acts of confi&s;cation. A fair execution of the treaty requir|ed, that every thing in this re&s;pect &s;hould be left where it was, and forbade the remedying of defects, in former proceedings as much as the in&s;titution of new judgments.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="028795_0021_0FDD49D449561F18">Another, and an unequivocal breach of the treaty is found in an act of South-Carolina, of March 26, 1784. This act &s;u&s;pends the recovery of Briti&s;h debts for nine months, and then allows them to be recover|ed only in four yearly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;tallments, contrary to the expre&s;s &s;tipulati|on of the 4th article, '<HI>that creditors on either &s;ide &s;halt meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value in &s;terling money, of all bona fide debts theretofore contracted.</HI>"</P>
<P>It is idle to attempt to excu&s;e infractions of this kind, by the pleas of di&s;tre&s;s and inability. This is to make the convenience of one party the mea&s;ure of its obligation to perform its promi&s;es to another. If there was really an impo&s;&s;ibility of payment, as has been pretend|ed, there was no need of legi&s;lative ob&s;truction; the thing would have regulated it&s;elf, and the very intere&s;t of the creditor was a pledge, that no general evil could have re&s;ulted from a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lowing a free cour&s;e to the laws. If &s;uch impediments could be ju&s;tified what im|pediments might not be ju&s;tified? What would become of the article, the only one in the treaty to be performed by us, of real con&s;equence to Great Britain?</P>
<P>This infraction by South Carolina was prior to that of the detenti|on of the po&s;ts by Great Britain.</P>
<P>But the ca&s;e of Virginia is &s;till &s;tronger than that of South Caroli|na. There is evidence which cannot be di&s;puted, that her courts, in defiance of the treaty, have con&s;tantly remained &s;hut to the recovery of Briti&s;h debts, in virtue of laws pa&s;&s;ed during the war.</P>

<P>The plain language of the&s;e re&s;olutions is, that there were acts pa&s;&s;ed during the war, which then actually inhibited the recovery of Briti&s;h debts, and that for the removal of this inhibition, a repealing act by the authority of Virginia was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>However un&s;ound this po&s;ition may have been in theory, here is conclu&s;ive evidence that the fact in Virginia was conformable to it; that her courts had been, ever &s;ince the peace, then were, and until a repealing law was pa&s;&s;ed, were likely to continue to be &s;hut again&s;t the recovery of Briti&s;h debts.&mdash;When te&s;timony of this kind was urged by the Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, was it po&s;&s;ible for our envoy to make any &s;olid reply? Who could be &s;uppo&s;ed to know better than the le|gi&s;lature of Virginia the real &s;tate of the fact? When that legi&s;lature declared it to be as has been &s;tated, who, or what could contradict
<PB N="22" REF="028795_0022_0FDD49C094798BF0">
it? With what truth has it been a&s;&s;erted, that "it was at all times <HI>perfectly under&s;tood,</HI> that Treaties controuled the laws of the &s;tates?"</P>
<P>Additional proof of the contrary is found in the &s;ub&s;equent con|duct of Virginia. On the 12th of December, 1787, that &s;tate pa&s;&s;ed an act repealing all &s;uch acts or parts of acts of the &s;tate, as had pre|vented, or might prevent the recovery of debts due to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, according to the true intent of the treaty; but with this provi&s;o, that there &s;hould be a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the repeal, 'till the governor, by ad|vice of council had by proclamation, notified that Great Britain had delivered up the po&s;ts, and was taking mea&s;ures for the further ful|filment of the treaty by delivering up the negroes, or by making com|pen&s;ation for them. This denotes clearly, that in the opinion of the legi&s;lature of Virginia, there were acts of that &s;tate which <HI>had pre|vented,</HI> and <HI>might prevent</HI> the recovery of debts according to the treaty.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable too, that the re&s;olutions of June, 1784, do not even give the expectation of a complete repeal of the impeding laws, in the event of, <HI>or</HI> reparation of the breaches of treaty by Great Britain. They only promi&s;e &s;uch a modification of them as would permit the payment in &s;uch <HI>time and manner as &s;hould con&s;i&s;t with the exhau&s;ted &s;ituation of the Commonwealth</HI>; that is, not according to the true intent of the treaty, but according to the opinion of the legi&s;lature of Vir|ginia of the abilities of the Commonwealth.</P>
<P>As the infraction which the&s;e proceedings of Virginia admit, re&s;ult|ed from acts pa&s;&s;ed during the war, it of cour&s;e was coeval with the fir&s;t exi&s;tence of the treaty of peace, and &s;eems to preclude the po&s;&s;i|bility of any prior breach by Great Britain. It has been at lea&s;t de|mon&s;trated, that the detention of the Po&s;ts was not &s;uch prior breach, as there was no obligation to &s;urrender, till after the exchange of the ratifications of the definitive treaty in England.</P>
<P>I pa&s;s by the &s;erious contraventions of the treaty, in this important article, of the debts which are of later date, becau&s;e they do not affect the que&s;tion of the fir&s;t breach, though they are of great weight to demon&s;trate the obligation of the United States to make compen|&s;ation.</P>
<P>The argument then, upon the whole, as to the que&s;tion of fir&s;t breach, &s;tands thus&mdash;It is a great doubt, whether the carrying away of the negroes was at all a breach. If it was one, the tre&s;pa&s;s act of this &s;tate preceded it in date, and went into operation the very mo|ment it was po&s;&s;ible to i&s;&s;ue proce&s;s. The detention of the po&s;ts is &s;ub&s;equent to breaches of the article concerning the recovery of debts on our part. This, in the ca&s;e of South Carolina, is determined by the date of her act (March 26, 1784) which is before the exchange of the ratifications of the definitive treaty could have taken place. In that of Virginia, it re&s;ults from her own te&s;timony, that impediments to the recovery of Briti&s;h debts, created by acts pa&s;&s;ed during the war, continued from the fir&s;t moment of the peace until after the year 1787. Or if, contrary to our own interpretation, we are di&s;po&s;|ed to adhere to the provi&s;ional treaty, as the act from which per|formance was to date, we were guilty of a breach, in not acting our|&s;elves upon that treaty; a breach which, being cotemporary with the exi&s;tence of the treaty, &s;eems not to admit of any prior contravention. From all which it follows that, take what ground we will, we mu&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="028795_0023_0FDD49D5755388F8">
be perplexed to fix the charge of the fir&s;t breach of the treaty upon Great Britain.</P>
<P>Let the appeal be to the under&s;tandings and hearts of candid men, men who have force of mind &s;ufficient to re&s;cue them&s;elves from the trammels of prejudice, and who dare to look even unpalatable truths in the face. Let &s;uch men pronounce whether they are &s;till &s;atisfi|ed, that Great Britain is clearly chargeable with the fir&s;t breaches of the treaty.&mdash;Whether they are not, on the contrary, convinced, that the que&s;tion is one &s;o mixed and doubtful, as to render a waver of it, even on the &s;core of intrin&s;ic merits, expedient on our part, and e&s;pecially whether they can entertain a particle of doubt, that it was wi&s;er to wave it, than to &s;uffer it to prove a final ob&s;tacle to the adju&s;t|ment of a controver&s;y, on which the peace of their country was &s;u&s;|pended. This was undoubtedly the alternative to our envoy. In the choice he made, the ultimate opinion of an enlightened country cannot fail to applaud his prudence.</P>

<P>THE di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in the two la&s;t numbers has &s;hewn, if I mi&s;take not, that this country by no means &s;tands upon &s;uch good ground, with regard to the inexecution of the treaty of peace, as &s;ome of our official proceedings have advanced, and as many among us have too lightly credited. The ta&s;k of di&s;playing this truth has been an unwel|come one. As long as a contrary doctrine was either a mere e&s;&s;ay of polemical &s;kill, or a convenient ingredien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of negociation, it was natu|ral for tho&s;e who thought indifferently of it to prefer &s;ilence to con|tradiction; but when it is made the engine of great errors of nation|al conduct, of exce&s;&s;ive preten&s;ions which forbid a rea&s;onable accom|modation of national differences, and endanger rupture and war, on grounds which rea&s;on di&s;approves, and prudence condemns, it becomes an indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to expo&s;e its hollowne&s;s and fallacy. Re&s;erve then would be a crime.&mdash;The true patriot who never fears to &s;acrifice popularity to what he believes to be the cau&s;e of public good, cannot he&s;itate to endeavor to unma&s;k the error, though with the certainty of incurring the di&s;plea&s;ure and cen&s;ure of the prejudiced and unthinking.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition to infract the treaty, which in <HI>&s;everal</HI> particulars di&s;covered it&s;elf among us, almo&s;t as &s;oon as it was known to have been made, was from its fir&s;t appearance a &s;ource of humiliation, re|gret, and apprehen&s;ion to tho&s;e who could di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately e&s;timate the con&s;equences, and who felt a proper concern for the honour and character of the country.

the experience of exten&s;ive evils may extort regrets which the fore|&s;ight of an enlightened people ought to avert.</P>
<P>Citizens of United America! as you value your pre&s;ent enviable lot, rally round your own good &s;en&s;e! expel from your confidence, men who have never cea&s;ed to mi&s;advi&s;e you! Di&s;card intemperate and illiberal pa&s;&s;ions! A&s;pire to the glory of the greate&s;t triumph which a people can gain, a triumph over prejudice! Be ju&s;t, be prudent! Li&s;ten impartially to the unadulterated language of truth! And above all guard your peace with anxious vigilance again&s;t all the artful &s;nares which are laid for it! Accompany me with minds open to conviction, in a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of un&s;peakable importance to your welfare!</P>
<P>Weigh well, as a preliminary to further inve&s;tigation, this mo|mentous propo&s;ition: "Peace, in the particular &s;ituation of this country, is an object of &s;uch great and primary magnitude, that it ought not to be relinqui&s;hed, unle&s;s the relinqui&s;hment be clearly ne|ce&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve our honour in &s;ome unequivocal point, or to avoid the &s;acrifice of, &s;ome right or intere&s;t of material and permanent im|portance." This is the touch&s;tone of every que&s;tion which can come before us, re&s;pecting our foreign concerns.</P>
<P>As a general propo&s;ition, &s;carcely any will di&s;pute it, but in the application of the rule, there is much confu&s;ion of ideas, much fal&s;e feeling and fal&s;er rea&s;oning. The ravings of anger and pride are mi&s;taken for the &s;ugge&s;tions of honour. Thus are we told in a deli|rium of rage, by a gentleman of South Carolina, that our envoy &s;hould have demanded an <HI>unconditional</HI> relinqui&s;hment of the We&s;tern Po&s;ts, as a right; till which was granted, and until Lord Grenville had given orders to Lord Dorche&s;ter to that effect, <HI>open to be &s;ent to our Pre&s;ident, to be by him forwarded,</HI> he &s;hould not have <HI>opened his lips about the treaty. It was pro&s;tituting the deare&s;t rights of freemen, and laying them pro&s;trate at the feet of royalty.</HI></P>
<P>In a ca&s;e of inconte&s;tible, <HI>mutual</HI> infractions of a treaty, one of the parties is to demand, peremptorily of the other, an <HI>unconditional</HI> per|formance on his part, by way of preliminary, and without negocia|tion. An envoy &s;ent to avert war, carrying with him the cleare&s;t indications of a general &s;olicitude of his country&mdash;that peace might be pre&s;erved, was at the very fir&s;t &s;tep of his progre&s;s to render ho&s;|tility inevitable, by exacting, not only what could not have been complied with, but what mu&s;t have been rejected with indignation. The government of Great Britain mu&s;t have been the mo&s;t abject on earth, in a ca&s;e &s;o &s;ituated, to have li&s;tened for a moment to &s;uch a demand. And becau&s;e our envoy did not pur&s;ue this frantic cour&s;e; did not hold the language of an imperious Ba&s;haw to his trembling &s;lave, he is ab&s;urdly &s;tigmatized as having <HI>pro&s;trated the rights of free|men at the feet of royalty.</HI> What are we to think of the &s;tate of the mind which could produce &s;o extravagant a &s;ally?

Will they be willing to take him as their guide in a critical emergency of their affairs?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No man in the habit of thinking well either of Mr. Rutledge's head or heart, but mu&s;t have felt at reading the pa&s;&s;ages of his &s;peech, which have been publi&s;hed, pain, &s;urpri&s;e, and mortification.

<P><PB N="25" REF="028795_0025_0FDD49D71B3F1518">True honour is a rational thing. It is as di&s;tingui&s;hable from Quixoti&s;m as true courage from the &s;pirit of a bravo. It is po&s;&s;i|ble for one nation to commit &s;o undi&s;gui&s;ed and unqualified an outrage upon another, as to render a negociation of the que&s;tion di&s;honoura|ble. But this &s;eldom, if ever happens. In mo&s;t ca&s;es it is con&s;i&s;tent with honour to precede rupture by negociation, and whenever it is, rea&s;on and humanity demand it. Honour cannot be wounded by con&s;ulting moderation. As a general rule, it is not till after it has become manife&s;t that rea&s;onable reparation for a clear premeditated wrong, cannot be obtained by an amicable adju&s;tment, that honour demands a re&s;ort to arms. In all the que&s;tions between us and Great-Britain, honour permitted the moderate cour&s;e: in tho&s;e which re|gard the inexecution of the treaty of peace, there had undoubtedly been mutual faults. It was therefore a ca&s;e for negociation and mu|tual reparation. True honour, which can never be &s;eparated from ju&s;tice, even requires reparation from us to Great-Britain, as well as from her to us. The injuries we complain of in the pre&s;ent war were al&s;o of a negociable kind. The fir&s;t was bottomed on a con|troverted point in the laws of nations. The &s;econd left open the que&s;tion, whether the principal injury was a de&s;igned act of the go|vernment or a mi&s;con&s;truction of its courts. To have taken there|fore, the imperious ground which is recommended, in place of that which was taken, would have been not to follow the admonitions of honour, but to have &s;ubmitted to the impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion and phrenzy.</P>
<P>So likewi&s;e when it is a&s;&s;erted that war is preferable to the &s;acrifice of our rights and intere&s;ts, this, to be true, to be rational, mu&s;t be under&s;tood of &s;uch rights and intere&s;ts as are certain, as are impor|tant, &s;uch as regard the honour, &s;ecurity, or pro&s;perity of our coun|try. It is not a right di&s;putable, or of &s;mall con&s;equence; it is not an intere&s;t temporary, partial, and incon&s;iderable, which will ju&s;tify, in our &s;ituation, an appeal to arms.</P>
<P>Nations ought to calculate as well as individuals, to compare evils, and to prefer the le&s;&s;er to the greater; to act otherwi&s;e is to act un|rea&s;onably; tho&s;e who coun&s;el it are impo&s;tors or madmen.</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections are of a nature to lead to a right judgment of the conduct of our envoy in the plan of adju&s;tment to which he has given his a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>Three objects, as has appeared, were to be aimed at, on behalf of the United States: 1. Compen&s;ation for the negroes carried away. 2. Surrender of the we&s;tern po&s;ts. 3. Compen&s;ation for &s;poliations during the exi&s;ting war.</P>
<P>Two of the&s;e objects, and the&s;e in every view the mo&s;t important, have been provided for&mdash;how fitly will be examined hereafter. One of them has been given up (to wit) compen&s;ation for the negroes.</P>
<P>It has been &s;hewn, as I tru&s;t, to the conviction of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pa&s;&s;ionate men, that the claim of compen&s;ation for the negroes, is in point of right a very doubtful one, in point of intere&s;t it certainly falls under the de&s;cription of partial and incon&s;iderable&mdash;affecting in no re&s;pect the honour or &s;ecurity of the nation, and incapable of having a &s;en|&s;ible influence upon its pro&s;perity. The pecuniary value of the ob|ject is, in a national &s;cale, trifling.</P>
<P>Not having before me the proper document, I can only &s;peak from
<PB N="26" REF="028795_0026_0FDD49C5D58771B0">
memory. But I do not fear to be materially mi&s;taken in &s;tating that the whole number carried away, &s;o a&s;certained as to have afforded evidence for a claim of compen&s;ation, was &s;hort of 3000 per&s;ons, men, women, and children, of whom about 1300 were of about 16 years and upwards. Computing the&s;e at an average of 150 dollars per head, which is a competent price, the amount would be 450,000 dollars, and not two or three millions as has been pretended.</P>
<P>It is a fact, which I a&s;&s;ert on the be&s;t authority, that our envoy made every effort in his power to e&s;tabli&s;h our con&s;truction of the article relating to this &s;ubject, and to obtain compen&s;ation, and that he did not relinqui&s;h it, till he became convinced, that to in&s;i&s;t upon it would defeat the purpo&s;e of his mi&s;&s;ion, and leave the controver&s;y between the two countries un&s;ettled.</P>
<P>Finding at the &s;ame time, that the two other points in di&s;pute could be rea&s;onably adju&s;ted.&mdash;Is there any one who will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h enough to affirm, that he ought to have broken off the negociation on account of the difficulty about the negroes? Yes, there are men, who are thus incon&s;iderate and intemperate! But will a &s;ober, re|flecting people ratify their &s;entence.</P>
<P>What would &s;uch a people have &s;aid to our envoy, had he returned with this ab&s;urd tale in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s mouth? "Countrymen! I could have obtained the &s;urrender of your po&s;ts, and an adequate provi&s;ion for the reparation of your lo&s;&s;es by unju&s;t captures&mdash;I could have termi|nated your controver&s;y with Great Britain, and &s;ecured the continu|ance of your peace, but for one ob&s;tacle, a refu&s;al to compen&s;ate for the negroes carried away; on this point the Briti&s;h government main|tained a con&s;truction of the treaty different from ours, and adhered to it with inflexibility. I confe&s;s, that there appeared to me much doubt concerning the true con&s;truction: I confe&s;s al&s;o, that the object was of incon&s;iderable value. Yet it made a part of our claims, and I thought the hazards of war preferable to a renunciation of it."</P>
<P>What would his adver&s;aries have replied to him on &s;uch an occa&s;ion? No ridicule would have been too &s;trong, no reproach too bitter.&mdash; Their triumph would have been complete: for he would have been de&s;ervedly left without advocate, without apologi&s;t.</P>
<P>It cannot admit of a &s;eriou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> doubt, that the affair of the negroes was too que&s;tionable in point of right, too in&s;ignificant in point of in|tere&s;t, to have been &s;uffered to be an impediment to the immen&s;e ob|jects which were to be promoted by an accommodation of differen|ces acceptable in other re&s;pects.&mdash;There was no general principle of national right or policy to be renounced. No con&s;ideration of honour forbid the renunciation, every calculation of intere&s;t in|vited to it. The evils of war for one month would outweigh the ad|vantage, if at the end of it there was a certainty of attainment.</P>
<P>But was war the alternative? Yes, war or di&s;grace.</P>
<P>The United States and Great-Britain had been brought to i&s;&s;ue. The recent &s;poliations of our commerce, &s;uperadded to the evils of a protracted Indian War, connected with the detention of the we&s;|tern po&s;ts, and accompanied with indications of a de&s;ign to contr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct our we&s;tern boundaries, ob&s;tructing the cour&s;e of our &s;ettlements and the enjoyment of private rights, and producing &s;erious and growing di&s;content in our we&s;tern country, rendered it indi&s;pen&s;able, that there &s;hould be a &s;ettlement of old differences, and a reparation of new wrongs; or, that the &s;word &s;hould vindicate our rights.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="028795_0027_0FDD49D8E823D160">This was certainly and with rea&s;on, the general &s;en&s;e of our coun|try when our envoy left it. There are many indications that it was the opinion of our government, and it is to be inferred that our envoy under&s;tood the alternative to be as has been &s;tated.</P>
<P>Indeed what el&s;e could be contemplated? after the depredations which had been commited upon our commerce, after the &s;trong &s;en|&s;ibility which had been di&s;covered upon the occa&s;ion in and out of our public councils, after an envoy extraordinary had been &s;ent to terminate differences and obtain reparation; if nothing had re&s;ulted, was there any cho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e but repri&s;als? &s;hould we not have rendered our|&s;elves ridiculous and contemptible in the eyes of the whole world, by forbearing them.</P>
<P>It is curious to ob&s;erve the incon&s;i&s;tency of certain men. They reprobate the treaty as incompatible with our honour, and yet they affect to believe that an abortion of the negociation would not have led to war. If they are &s;incere, they mu&s;t think that national honor con&s;i&s;ts in perpetually railing, complaining, blu&s;tering and &s;ub|mitting. For my part, much as I deprecate war, I entertain no doubt that it would have been our duty to meet it with deci&s;ion had the negociation failed; that a due regard to our honour, our rights and our intere&s;ts would have enjoined it upon us. Nor would a pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;illanimous pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s have &s;aved us from it. So un&s;ettled a &s;tate of things would have led to fre&s;h injuries and aggravations, and cir|cum&s;tances too powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted, would have dragged us into war. We &s;hould have lo&s;t our honor without pre&s;erving our peace. Nations in &s;imilar &s;ituations have no option but to accommodate differences or to fight. Tho&s;e which have &s;trong motives to avoid war, &s;hould by their moderation, facilitate the accommodation of differences. This is a rule of good &s;en&s;e, a maxim of &s;ound policy.</P>
<P>But the misfortune is, that men will oppo&s;e imagination to fact. Though we &s;ee Great-Britain predominant on the ocean: though we ob&s;erve her pertinaciou&s;ly re&s;i&s;ting the idea of pacification with France amid&s;t the greate&s;t di&s;couragements: though we have em|ployed a man who&s;e &s;agacity and integrity have been hitherto undi&s;|puted, and of a character far from flexible, to a&s;certain what was practicable: though circum&s;tances favored his exertions: though much time and pains were be&s;towed upon the &s;ubject: though there is not only his te&s;timony, but the te&s;timony of other men who were immediately on the &s;cene, and in whom there is every rea&s;on to con|fide, that all was attained which was attainable&punc; yet we &s;till permit our&s;elves to imagine, that more and better could have been done, and that by taking even now a high and menacing tone, Great-Britain may be brought to our feet.</P>
<P>Even a &s;tile of politene&s;s in our envoy has been con&s;trued to his di&s;advantage. Becau&s;e he did not mi&s;take &s;trut for dignity, and rude|ne&s;s for &s;pirit; becau&s;e he did not, by petulance and a&s;perity, in&s;i&s;t the pride of the Briti&s;h court again&s;t the &s;ucce&s;s of his mi&s;&s;ion, he is repre&s;ented as having humiliated him&s;elf and his nation. It is forgot|ten that mildne&s;s in the manner, and firmne&s;s in the thing, are mo&s;t compatible with true dignity, and almo&s;t always go further than har&s;h|ne&s;s and &s;tateline&s;s.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;itions that more could be done by di&s;playing what is called, greater &s;pirit, are not warranted by facts. It would be extremely
<PB N="28" REF="028795_0028_0FDD49C771B8A340">
imprudent on that ba&s;is, to tru&s;t our&s;elves to a further experiment&mdash;to the immen&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes in the affairs of Europe, which from moment to moment may e&s;&s;entially vary the relative &s;ituations of contending parties.

<P>But it is a&s;ked, to avoid Sylla, may we not run upon Charibdis?&mdash; If the treaty &s;hould pre&s;erve our peace with Britain, may it not inter|rupt it with France? I an&s;wer, that to me there appears no room for apprehen&s;ion. It will be &s;hewn in the cour&s;e of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, that the treaty interferes in no one particular with our engagements to France, and will make no alteration whatever in the &s;tate of things between us and her, except as to the &s;elling prizes in our ports, which not being required by treaty, was originally permitted merely becau&s;e there was no law to forbid it, and which being confined to France, was of very que&s;tionable propriety on the principles of neutrality, and has been a &s;ource of di&s;&s;atisfaction to other belligerent powers. This being the ca&s;e, no cau&s;e of umbrage is given to France by the treaty,&mdash;and it is as contrary to her intere&s;t as to her inclination, want only to &s;eek a quarrel with us. Pro&s;trate indeed were our &s;ituation, if we could not, without offending France, make a treaty with ano|ther power, which merely tended to extingui&s;h controver&s;y, and to regulate the rules of commerical intercour&s;e, and this not only with|out violating any duty to France but without giving any preference to another. It is a&s;toni&s;hing that tho&s;e who affect &s;o much nicety about national honour, do not feel the extreme humilation of &s;uch an idea. As to the denomination of Alliance with Great-Britain, which has been given to the treaty, it is an in&s;ult to the under&s;tandings of the people, to call it by &s;uch a name. There is not a tittle of it that warrants the appellation.</P>

<P>THERE is one more objection to the treaty for what it does not do, which requires to be noticed. This is an omi&s;&s;ion to pro|vide again&s;t the impre&s;&s;ment of our &s;eamen.</P>
<P>It is certain that our trade has &s;uffered embarra&s;&s;ments in this re&s;|pect, and that there have been abu&s;es which have operated very op|pre&s;&s;ively upon our &s;eamen, and all will join in the wi&s;h that they could have been guarded again&s;t in future by the treaty.</P>
<P>But it is ea&s;ier to de&s;ire this, than to &s;ee how it could have been done. A general &s;tipulation again&s;t the impre&s;&s;ment of our &s;eamen would have been nugatory, if not derogatory. Our right to an ex|emption is perfect by the laws of nations, and a contrary right is not even pretended by Great Britain. The difficulty has been and is to fix a rule of evidence, by which to di&s;criminate our &s;eamen from theirs, and by the di&s;crimination to give ours protection, without covering theirs in our &s;ervice It happens that the two nations &s;peak
<PB N="29" REF="028795_0029_0FDD49D9F68E2FC0">
the &s;ame language, and in every exterior circum&s;tance clo&s;ely re&s;em|ble each other; that many of the natives of Great Britain and Ireland are among our citizens, and that others without being properly our citizens, are employed in our ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Every body knows, that the &s;afety of Great Britain depends upon her marine. This was never more emphatically the ca&s;e, than in the war in which &s;he is now engaged. Her very exi&s;tence, as an in|dependent power, &s;eems to re&s;t on a maritime &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, can we be &s;urpri&s;ed that there are difficulties in bringing her to con&s;ent to any arrangement which would enable us by receiving her &s;eamen into our employment, to detain them from her &s;ervice? Unfortunately there can be devi&s;ed no method of pro|tecting our &s;eamen which does not involve that danger to her. Lan|guage and appearance, in&s;tead of being a guide as between other nations, are between us and Great Britain, &s;ources of mi&s;take and deception. The mo&s;t familiar experience in the ordinary affairs of &s;ociety, proves, that the oaths of parties intere&s;ted, cannot be fully relied upon. Certificates of citizen&s;hip, by officers of one party, Would be too open to the po&s;&s;ibility of collu&s;ion and impo&s;ition, to expect that the other would admit them to be conclu&s;ive. If incon|clu&s;ive, there mu&s;t be a di&s;cretion to the other party which would de&s;troy their efficacy.</P>
<P>In whatever light the matter may be viewed, there will be found an intrin&s;ic difficulty in devi&s;ing a rule of evidence &s;afe for both parties, and con&s;equently, in e&s;tabli&s;hing one by treaty. No nation would rea|dily admit a rule which would make it depend on the good faith of another, and the integrity of its agents, whether her &s;eamen in time of war, might be withdrawn from her &s;ervice, and transferred to that of a neutral power. Such a rule, as between, Great Britain and us, would be peculiarly dangerous, on account of the circum&s;tances, which facilitate a tran&s;fer of &s;eamen from one party to another. Great Britain has accordingly per&s;everingly declined any definitive arrange|ment on the &s;ubject; notwith&s;tanding earne&s;t and reiterated efforts of our government.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider candidly the peculiar difficulties which various circum&s;tances of &s;imilitude, between the people of the two countries, oppo&s;e to a &s;atisfactory arrangement, and that to the belligerent party, it is a que&s;tion of <HI>national &s;afety,</HI> to the neutral party a que&s;tion of commercial convenience, and individual &s;ecurity, we &s;hall be the le&s;s dipo&s;ed to think the want of &s;uch a provi&s;ion as our wi&s;hes would dic|tate, a blemi&s;h in the treaty.</P>
<P>The truth &s;eems to be, that from the nature of the thing, it is matter of nece&s;&s;ity to leave it to occa&s;ional and temporary expedi|ents&mdash;to the effect of &s;pecial interpo&s;itions from time to time, to procure the correction of abu&s;es; and if the abu&s;e becomes intolera|ble to the <HI>ultima ratio</HI>; the good faith of the parties, and the motives which they have to re&s;pect the rights of each other, and to avo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d cau&s;es of offence, and vigilance in noting and remon&s;trating again&s;t the irregularities which are committed, are probably the only peace|able &s;ecurities of which the ca&s;e is &s;u&s;ceptible.</P>
<P>Our mini&s;ter plenipotentiary Mr. Pinckney, it is well known, has long had this matter in charge, and has &s;trenuou&s;ly exerted him&s;elf to have it placed upon &s;ome acceptable footing; but his endeavours
<PB N="30" REF="028795_0030_0FDD49C8C9897F70">
have been un&s;ucce&s;sful, further than to mitigate the evil by &s;ome ad|ditional checks, and by drawing the attention of the Briti&s;h govern|ment to the ob&s;ervance of more caution. A more &s;en&s;ible effect of our repren&s;entations, has been lately experienced; and with attenti|on and vigilance, that effect may be continued, and perhaps increa&s;|ed. But there is rea&s;on to fear that it will be con&s;tantly found im|practicable to e&s;tabli&s;h an efficacious conventional guard.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the examination of the &s;everal articles in the treaty, in the order in which they &s;tand.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t contains merely a general declaration that there &s;hall be peace and friend&s;hip between the contracting parties, the countries and people of each, without exception of per&s;ons of places.</P>
<P>One would have imagined that this article, at lea&s;t, would have e&s;caped a formal objection; however it might have been &s;ecretly viewed as the mo&s;t &s;inful of all, by tho&s;e who pant after war and enmity between the two countries. Nothing but the fact could have led to a &s;urmi&s;e, that it was po&s;&s;ible for it to have been deemed ex|ceptionable; and nothing can better di&s;play the rage for objection, which actuates the adver&s;aries of the treaty, than their having invent|ed one again&s;t &s;o innocent a provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>But the committee appointed by a meeting at Charle&s;ton (S. C.) have &s;agaciou&s;ly di&s;covered, that this article permits "the uncondi|tional return to our country of all per&s;ons who were pro&s;cribed dur|ing the late war."</P>
<P>With all, but men determined to be di&s;&s;atisfied, it would be a &s;uf|&s;ufficient an&s;wer to &s;uch an objection to &s;ay, that this article to a for|mula in almo&s;t every treaty on record and that the con&s;equence attri|buted to it was never before dreamt of, though other nations be&s;ides our&s;elves have had their pro&s;criptions and their ban<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hments.</P>
<P>But this is not all&mdash;our treaty of peace with Great Britain in 1783, has an equivalent &s;tipulation in the&s;e words, (article 6) "there &s;hall be a firm and perpetual peace between his Britannic maje&s;ty and the &s;aid &s;tates, and between the &s;ubjects of the one, and the citizens of the other." In calling this an equivalent &s;tipulation, I &s;peak with re|ference to the objection which is made.</P>
<P>The argument to &s;upport that objection would be to this effect; "Exiles and criminals are regarded as within the peace of a coun|try; but the people of each are, by this article, placed within the peace of the other; therefore pro&s;cribed per&s;ons are re&s;tored to the peace of the United States, and &s;o lo&s;e the character of exiles and criminals. Hence the argument will turn upon the word "peace"&mdash; the word friend&s;hip will have no influence upon the que&s;tion. In other re&s;pects there is no difference, in &s;ub&s;tance, between the two articles. For the terms "people," "&s;ubjects," "citizens," as u&s;ed in the two treaties, are &s;ynonimous. If therefore, the la&s;t treaty &s;ti|pulates that there &s;hall be peace between the governments, countries, and people of the two nations, the fir&s;t &s;tipulates what is equivalent, that there &s;hall be peace between the two governments and the &s;ub|jects and citizens of each. The additional words, without exception of per&s;ons and places, can make no difference, being merely &s;urplu|&s;age. If A &s;ays to B, "I give you all the money in this pur&s;e," the gift is as complete as if he had &s;aid, "I give you all the money in this pur&s;e, without exception of a &s;ingle dollar."</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="028795_0031_0FDD49DEAF9F7F70">But the object of the &s;tipulation, and the &s;ubject of the objection, have no relation to each other. National &s;tipulations are to be con|&s;idered in the &s;en&s;e of the laws of nations. Peace, in the &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e laws defines a &s;tate which is oppo&s;ite to war. Peace, in the &s;en&s;e of the municipal laws, defines a &s;tate which is oppo&s;ite to criminality. They are con&s;equently different things, and a &s;ub|ject of Great Britain, by committing a crime, may put him&s;elf out of the peace of our government, in the &s;en&s;e of our municipal laws, while there might be perfect peace with him, in the &s;en&s;e of the laws of nations, and <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> there might be war wi&s;h him in the &s;en&s;e of the laws of nations, and peace in that of the municipal laws.</P>
<P>The puni&s;hment of a &s;ubject of Great Britain as a felo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, would certainly not con&s;titute a &s;tate of war between the parties, nor inter|fere with the peace which is &s;tipulated by this article; though it is declared that it &s;hall be <HI>inviolable,</HI> and might as well be affirmed to prevent the puni&s;hment of future, as of former criminals.</P>
<P>But who in the contemplation of the laws of the re&s;pective &s;tates, are the pro&s;cribed per&s;ons? They mu&s;t have been under&s;tood to have been &s;ubjects or citizens of the &s;tates which pro&s;cribed them&mdash;con&s;e|quently cannot be pre&s;umed to be comprehended in an article which &s;tipulates peace between the nations and their re&s;pective citizens.</P>
<P>This is not a &s;tipulation of peace between a nation and its own citizens; nor can the idea of expatriation be admitted to go &s;o far as to de&s;troy the relation of citizen as it regards amenability for a crime. To this purpo&s;e, at lea&s;t, the offender mu&s;t remain a citizen.</P>
<P>There can hardly have been a time when a treaty was formed be|tween two nations, when one or the other had not exiled criminals or fugitives from ju&s;tice, which it would have been unwilling to rein|&s;tate. Yet this was never deemed an ob&s;tacle to the article, nor has an immunity from puni&s;hment ever been claimed under it, nor is there the lea&s;t ground to a&s;&s;ert that it might be claimed under it.</P>
<P>It follows that the objection which has been taken to this article is wholly without foundation. It is humiliating to the human under|&s;tanding, or di&s;reputable to the human heart, that &s;imilar objections &s;hould come from &s;en&s;ible men&mdash;it is di&s;gu&s;tful to have to refu&s;e them.

<P>THE &s;econd article of the treaty &s;tipulates that his Britannic maje&s;ty will withdraw, all his troops and garri&s;ons from all <HI>pa&s;ts</HI> and <HI>places</HI> within the boundary lines a&s;&s;igned by the treaty of peace to the United States; and that this evacuation &s;hall take place on or before the fir&s;t day June 1796; The United States in the mean time <HI>at their di&s;cretion,</HI> extending their &s;ettlements to any part within the &s;aid boundary line, <HI>except within the precincts or juri&s;dictions</HI> of any of the &s;aid po&s;ts&mdash;that all &s;ettlers or traders within the precincts or juri&s;|diction of the &s;aid po&s;ts, &s;hall continue to enjoy, unmole&s;ted, all their property of every kind, and &s;hall be protected therein; that they &s;hall be at liberty to remain there, or to remove with all or any part of their effects; al&s;o to &s;ell their lands, hou&s;es or effects, or to retain the property thereof at their di&s;cretion, that &s;uch of them as &s;hall continue to re&s;ide within the &s;aid boundary lines, &s;hall not be com|pelled to become citizens of the United States, but &s;hall be at liberty to do &s;o if they think proper, making and declaring their election within a year after the evacuation, and that tho&s;e who &s;hould continue after the expiration of a year without having declared their intenti|on of remaining &s;ubjects of his Britannic Maje&s;ty, &s;hall be con&s;ider|ed as having elected to become citizens of the United States.</P>
<P>This article which accompli&s;hes a primary object of our envoy's mi&s;&s;ion, and one of primary importance to the United States, has been as much clamoured again&s;t as if it had made a formal ce&s;&s;ion of the po&s;ts to Great Britain. On this point an uncommon degree of art has been exerted, and with no &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s. The value of the prin|cipal thing obtained has been put out of &s;ight by mi&s;repre&s;entations of incidental circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>But the fact is neverthele&s;s, that an object has been accompli&s;hed, of va&s;t con&s;equence to our country. The mo&s;t important <HI>de&s;idera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> in our concerns with foreign powers are, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the We&s;tern po&s;ts, and a participation in the navigation of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. More or fewer of commercial privileges are of va&s;tly inferior mo|ment. The force of circum&s;tances will do all we can rea&s;onably wi&s;h in this re&s;pect, and in a &s;hort time, without any &s;teps that may con|vul&s;e our trade or endanger tranquility, will carry us to our goal.</P>
<P>The recovery of our We&s;tern Po&s;ts will have many important &s;ides. It will extingui&s;h a &s;ource of controver&s;y with Great Britain, which at a period, not di&s;tant, mu&s;t have inevitably involved the two coun|tries in war, and the thing was becoming every day, more and more urgent. It will enable us effectually to controul the ho&s;tilities of the northern and we&s;tern Indians, and in &s;o doing will have a material influence on the &s;outhern tribes. It will therefore tend to re&s;cue the country from what is at pre&s;ent its greate&s;t &s;courge, INDIAN WARS. When we con&s;ider that the&s;e wars have, for four years pa&s;t, taken an extra million annually from our revenue; we cannot be in&s;en&s;ible of the importance of terminating that &s;ource of expence. This milli|on

<P>The advantages of the recovery of the Po&s;ts do not &s;top here; an exten&s;ion of trade is to be added to the catalogue. This however need only be mentioned at this time as it will come again into view in con&s;idering the third article.</P>
<P>But two con&s;equences, not commonly adverted to, require particu|lar notice in this place.</P>
<P>There is ju&s;t ground of &s;u&s;picion, corroborated by various concur|ring circum&s;tances, that Great Britain has entertained the project of contracting our boundaries to the Ohio. This has appeared in Cana|da&mdash;at the Briti&s;h garri&s;ons&mdash;at the Indian towns&mdash;at Philadelphia, and at London. The &s;urrender of the po&s;ts for ever cuts up by the roots, this pernicious project. The whole of our we&s;tern intere&s;ts are immediately and deeply concerned in the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The harmonious, and permanent connection of our we&s;tern with our Atlantic country, materially depends on our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the We&s;tern po&s;ts. Already had great di&s;content been engendered in that country by their detention. That di&s;content was increa&s;ing and rankling daily. It was actually one of the aliments of the in&s;urrection in the we&s;tern parts of Penn&s;ylvania. While the po&s;ts remained in the hands of Great Britain, dangerous tamperings with the inhabitants of that country were to be apprehended&mdash;a community of views be|tween Great Britain and Spain might have taken place, and by force and &s;eduction,events formidable to our general union might have been hazarded. The di&s;&s;olution or prevention of this community of views, is a point of the greate&s;t moment in our &s;y&s;tem of national policy. It pre&s;&s;es us to terminate differences, to extingui&s;h mi&s;under&s;tand|ings with Great Britain; it urges us to improve the favourable mo|ment, and &s;tamps with the charge of madne&s;s, the efforts to let go the hold which the treaty, if mutually ratified, would give us.</P>
<P>Whoever will ca&s;t his eye upon the map o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the United States, will &s;urvey the po&s;ition of the we&s;tern po&s;ts, their relations to our we&s;tern waters, and their general bearings upon our we&s;tern country; and is at the &s;ame time capable of making the reflections, which an accurate view of the &s;ubject &s;ugge&s;ts, will di&s;cover multiplied confirmations of the po&s;ition, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e po&s;ts by us, has an intimate connection with the pre&s;ervation of union between our we&s;tern and Atlantic territories; and whoever can appreciate the immen&s;e mi&s;|chiefs of a di&s;union, will feel the prodigious value of the acqui&s;ition. To &s;uch a man, the que&s;tion may be confidently put&punc; Is there any thing in the treaty conceded by us to Great Britain, to be placed in competition with this &s;ingle acqui&s;ition? The an&s;wer could not fail to be in the negative.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid by way of objection, that admitting the po&s;ts will be &s;urrendered at the time &s;tipulated, it is no acqui&s;ition by this treaty; it is only the enjoyment of a right which was &s;ecured by the treaty of peace.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="028795_0034_0FDD49CBE2778450">With as much good &s;en&s;e might it be &s;aid, that the &s;tipulation of reparation for the &s;poilations of our property, or even immediate actual reparation, if it had been obtained, was nothing gained; be|cau&s;e the laws of nations gave us a right to &s;uch reparation; and it might in this way be proved to have been impo&s;&s;ible for our envoy to have effected any thing u&s;eful or meritorious.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee what is the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e. Great-Britain had en|gaged by the treaty of peace, to &s;urrender the We&s;tern Po&s;ts <HI>with all covenient &s;peed</HI>; but without fixing a preci&s;e time. For the cau&s;e, or on the pretext of our not having complied with the treaty on our part, e&s;pecially, in not removing the impediments which the antece|dent laws of particular &s;tates, oppo&s;ed to the recovery of Briti&s;h debts, &s;he delayed, and afterwards refu&s;ed to make the &s;urrender; and when our envoy left this country, there was too much appearance of an in|tention on her part to detain them indefinitely, and this, after having actually kept them ten years. The treaty of peace was con&s;equently in this particular &s;u&s;pended, if not &s;uperceded. It was either to be rein&s;tated by a new agreement, or enforced by arms. The fir&s;t our envoy has effected; he has brought Great-Britain to abandon the di&s;|pute, and to fix a preci&s;e determinate time when at farthe&s;t the po&s;ts are to be delivered up. It is therefore to this new agreement, that we &s;hall owe the enjoyment of them, and it is of cour&s;e, entitled to the merit of having obtained them; it is a po&s;itive ingredient in its value, which cannot be taken from it; and it may be added, that this is the fir&s;t time that the merit of procuring, by negociation, <HI>re&s;titution</HI> of a <HI>right witheld,</HI> was ever denied to the in&s;trument which procur|ed it.</P>
<P>But it is objected, that as much has not been done as might have been done; that re&s;titution of the po&s;ts has not been procured, but only a promi&s;e to re&s;tore them at a remote period, in exchange for a former promi&s;e, which had been violated. That there is no good ground of reliance upon the fulfilment of this new promi&s;e, for the performance of which there ought to have been &s;ome &s;urety or gua|rantee&mdash;that the re&s;titution of the po&s;ts ought to have been accom|panied with indemnification for the detention, and for the expences of the Indian wars which have been occa&s;ioned by that detention, and by the in&s;tigations of Briti&s;h intrigue&mdash;that it was better to go to war than to relinqui&s;h our claim to &s;uch indemnification; or if our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances did not recommend this, it was better to wait till it was more convenient to us to enforce our claim, than to give it up. The&s;e are the declamations by which this part of the treaty is arraigned. Let us &s;ee, if they are the random effu&s;ions of enthu&s;ia&s;m, or the rational dictates of &s;ound policy.</P>
<P>As to the &s;ugge&s;tion, that more might have been done than was done, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be mere conjecture and imagination. If the picture given of the &s;ituation of Great-Britain, was better ju&s;tified by facts, than it is, it would not follow that the &s;ugge&s;tion is true; for the thing would depend not on the real &s;ituation of that country, but on the opinion entertained of it by its own admini&s;tration, on the per&s;onal character of the prince and of his council; on the de|gree by which they were influenced by pride and pa&s;&s;ion, or by rea&s;on. The hypothe&s;is, that the di&s;po&s;itions of a government are conform|able with its &s;ituation, is as fallacious a one as can be entertained. It

If we carefully p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e the &s;peeches of the leading members of the Convention, we &s;hall ob&s;erve the menaces again&s;t Great-Britain frequently inter&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;ed with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nvitations to peace. While the Briti&s;h government maintains a proud and di&s;tant re&s;erve, repels every idea of peace, and inflexibly pur&s;ues the path of war. If the &s;itu|ation of Europe in general, and of Great Britain in particular, as is pretended, authori&s;ed us to expect, to exact whatever we cho&s;e, how happens it, that France, with all her victories, has not yet been able even to exact peace.</P>
<P>But the picture given of the &s;ituation of Great-Britain to war|rant the inferences which are drawn, is exaggerated and fal&s;e.&mdash;It cannot be denied that the is triumphant on the ocean; that the ac|qui&s;itions &s;he has made upon France, are hitherto greater than tho&s;e which France has made upon her. If, on the one hand, &s;he owes an immen&s;e debt, on the other, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an immen&s;e credit, which there is no &s;ymptom of being impaired. Briti&s;h credit, has become in a Briti&s;h mind, an <HI>article of faith,</HI> and is no longer an object of rea|&s;on. How long it may la&s;t, how far it may go, is incalculable.&mdash; But it is evident, that it &s;till affords prodigious re&s;ource<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and that it is likely for &s;ome time to come to afford them. In addition to this, it is a well a&s;certained fact, that her government po&s;&s;e&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, internally, as much vigour, and has as much national &s;upport as it perhaps ever had a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any former period of her hi&s;tory. Alarmed by the unfortu|nate exce&s;&s;es in France, mo&s;t men of property cling to the govern|ment, and carry with them the great bulk of the nation, almo&s;t the whole of the farming intere&s;t, and much the greate&s;t proportion of other indu&s;trious cla&s;&s;es. Her manufactures, though probably wound|ed by war, are &s;till in a comparatively flouri&s;hing condition. They &s;uffice not only for her own &s;upply, but for the full extent of foreign demand, and the markets for them have not been materially contract|ed by the war. Her foreign commerce continues <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mmen&s;e; as a &s;pecimen of it, it may be mentioned, that the &s;hips from India this year, announced to have been &s;een upon or near the Briti&s;h coa&s;t, amounted to 35 in number, computed to be worth be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ween four and five millions &s;terling. It is no light circum&s;tance in the e&s;timate of her re&s;ources, that a va&s;t preponderacy in that quarter of the globe continues to nouri&s;h her wealth and power.</P>
<P>If from a view of Great Britain &s;ing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, we pa&s;s to a view of her foreign connections, we &s;hall find no cau&s;e to con&s;ider her as a pro&s;trate nation. Among her allies, are the two greate&s;t powers of Europe (France excepted) namely, Ru&s;&s;ia and Au&s;tria, or the Empe|ror&mdash;Spain and Sardinia continue to make common cau&s;e with her. There is no power of Europe which has di&s;played a more uniform Character of per&s;everance than Au&s;tria; for which &s;he has very &s;trong motives on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. Ru&s;&s;ia too, is remarkable for her

&s;teadine&s;s to her purpo&s;e, whatever it may be. It is true, that here|tofore &s;he has not di&s;covered much zeal in the coalition, but there are &s;ymptoms of her becoming more clo&s;ely and cordially engaged. If &s;he does, &s;he is a great weight in the &s;cale.</P>
<P>Again&s;t this will be &s;et the a&s;toni&s;hing victories, he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ic&punc; exploits, and va&s;t armies of France, her rapid conque&s;ts to the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me, the total reduction of Holland, the progre&s;s of her arms in Spain and Italy, the detaching of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia from the coalition, and the pro&s;pect of detaching &s;ome o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hers of the German Princes; and it will be added, that the continental enemies of France appear exhau&s;ted, de&s;|pairing, and unable to continue the war.</P>
<P>This, if offered only to &s;hew that there is no probability that the enemies of France can &s;ucceed in the original objects of the war again&s;t her, or can dive&s;t her of her acqui&s;itions on the continent, has all the force that may be de&s;ired to be given to it, but when it is u&s;ed to prove that the &s;ituation of Great Britain is &s;o de&s;perate and humbled as to oblige her to receive from France, or the United States, any conditions which either of them may think fit to impo&s;e; the argument is carried infinitely too far. It is one thing for a country to be in a po&s;ture not to receive the law from others, and a very dif|ferent thing for her to be in a &s;ituation which obliges others to re|ceive the law from her, and what is &s;till &s;tronger, from all her friends. France evidently cannot annoy Ru&s;&s;ia&mdash;&s;he can, with great difficulty, from their geographical po&s;ition, make any further acqui&s;itions upon the territories of Au&s;tria.&mdash;Britain and her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are e&s;&s;entially &s;afe, while &s;he maintains a decided maritime &s;uperiority.&mdash;As long as this is the ca&s;e, even &s;uppo&s;ing her abandoned by all her allies, &s;he never can be in the &s;ituation which is pretended by the oppo&s;ers of the treaty.</P>
<P>But in de&s;cribing the &s;ituation of France, only one &s;ide of the me|dal is pre&s;ented.&mdash;There is another &s;ide far le&s;s flattering, and which in order to a ju&s;t conclu&s;ion, mu&s;t be impartially viewed.</P>
<P>If the allies of Great Britain are fatigued and exhau&s;ted, France cannot be in a better condition. The efforts of the latter, in propor|tion to intrin&s;ic re&s;ources, have no doubt been much greater than tho&s;e of the former. It is a con&s;equence from this, phy&s;ically certain, that France mu&s;t be &s;till more fatigued and exhau&s;ted even than her adver&s;aries. Her acqui&s;itions cannot materially vary this conclu&s;ion; the low countries, long the theatre of the war, mu&s;t have been pret|ty well emptied before they fell into her hands. Holland is an arti|ficial power&mdash;her life and &s;trength were in her credit&mdash;this peri&s;hed with her reduction. Accordingly the &s;uccours extracted from her compared with the &s;cale of the war, have been in&s;ignificant.</P>
<P>As to the true po&s;ition of France, we are not left to mere infe|rence.</P>
<P>All the official reports, all the private accounts from thence ac|knowledge a &s;tate of extreme embarra&s;&s;ment and di&s;tre&s;s: an alarm|ing derangement of the finances, and a &s;carcity not di&s;tant from fa|mine. To this are to be added, a continuance of violent and de&s;truc|tive conflicts of parties, and the unextingui&s;hed embers of in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>This fair compari&s;on of the relative &s;ituation of the contending parties will, I know, be &s;tigmatized as blazoning the &s;trength and re|&s;ources of Great-Britain, and depreciating the advantages of France.
<PB N="37" REF="028795_0037_0FDD49E32B7C2FD8">
But the cant phra&s;es of party cannot alter the truth&mdash;nor will they prevent the people of the United States from li&s;tening impartially to it, or from di&s;cerning that it is a mark of fidelity to their inte|re&s;ts to counteract mi&s;repre&s;entation, by placing facts fairly before them, and a duty which they cannot omit to perform without betray|ing their own intere&s;ts, to receive them candidly, and weigh them maturely.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion is, that all tho&s;e highly charged declamations which de&s;cribe Great-Britain to us as vanqui&s;hed and humbled; as ready to pa&s;s under the yoke at our command, and to &s;ubmit to any condi|tions which we may think fit to pre&s;cribe, are either the chimeras of over heated imaginations, or the fabrications of impo&s;ture; and if li&s;tened to, can have no other effect than to in&s;pire a delu&s;ive pre&s;ump|tion, and a dangerous temerity.</P>
<P>But to judge the better of the extravagance of the&s;e declamations, it will be u&s;eful to go back to the periods when the negociation be|gan and ended. Our envoy arrived in England and entered upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of his mi&s;&s;ion, at the moment when there was a general ela|tion on account of the naval victory gained by Lord Howe, and pre|vious to tho&s;e important &s;ucce&s;&s;es which have terminated in the conque&s;t of Holland; and the treaty was concluded by the 19th of Nov. la&s;t, prior to the la&s;t mentioned event, and to the defection of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. The po&s;ture of things at the time it was in ne|gociation, and not at this time, is the &s;tandard by which to try its merits; and it may be ob&s;erved, that it is probable the negociation received its fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, and even its general out line anterior to the principal part of the di&s;a&s;ters &s;u&s;tained by the coale&s;ced powers in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t campaign.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to add, that if we credit the repre&s;entati|ons of our envoy Great Britain manife&s;ted &s;imilar di&s;po&s;itions with regard to the treaty at the commencement as at the clo&s;e of the ne|gociation: whence it will follow, that too much has been attributed, in this country to the victories of France.</P>

<P>ONE of the particulars, in which our en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oy is alledged to have fallen &s;hort of what might or ought to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve been done, re&s;pect the time for the &s;urrender of the we&s;tern po&s;ts.

How un&s;ub&s;tantial the foundation on which this cour&s;e of proceeding is recommended, has been already developed.</P>
<P>The fact was, that our envoy pre&s;&s;ed an early evacuation of the
<PB N="38" REF="028795_0038_0FDD49CEC6801FA0">
Po&s;ts; but there was an inflexible adherence on the other &s;ide to the term limited in the treaty. The rea&s;ons under&s;tood to have been a&s;|&s;igned for it, were to this effect, viz. That according to the cour&s;e of the Indian trade, it was cu&s;tomary to &s;pread thro the nations, goods to a large amount, the returns for which, could not be drawn into Canada, in a &s;horter period than was propo&s;ed to be fixed for the evacuation; that the impre&s;&s;ion which the &s;urre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r of all the po&s;ts to American garri&s;ons might make on the minds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Indians, could not be fore&s;een; that there was the greater rea&s;on for caution, as on a former occa&s;ion it had been intima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to them by public agents of the United States, that they had been <HI>for&s;aken</HI> and <HI>given up</HI> by the Briti&s;h government; that the protection promi&s;ed on our part, how|ever &s;incere and however competent in other re&s;pects, might not be &s;ufficient in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to prevent the embarra&s;&s;ment which might en&s;ue; that for the&s;e rea&s;ons the traders ought to have time to conclu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e their adventures, which were pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon the exi&s;t|ing &s;tate of things; that they would in future calculate upon the new &s;tate of things, but that in the mean time the care of government ought not to be withdrawn from them.</P>
<P>There is ground to believe that there were repre&s;entations on be|half of the Canada traders, alledging a longer term than that which was adopted in the treaty, to be nece&s;&s;ary to wind up and adapt their arrangements to the new &s;tate of things; and that the term &s;ugge&s;ted by them was abridged &s;everal months. And it may not be u&s;ele&s;s to ob&s;erve, as explanatory of the rea&s;ons given, that in fact it is the cour&s;e of the trade to give long credits to the Indians, and that the returns for goods furni&s;hed in one year, only come in the next year.</P>
<P>What was to be done in this ca&s;e? Was the negociation to break off o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay to be admitted? The la&s;t was preferred by our envoy, and the preference was rightly judged.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence of breaking off the negociation has been &s;tated. No rea&s;onab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e man will doubt that delay was preferable to war if there be good ground of reliance, that the &s;tipulation will be fulfilled at the appointed time.&mdash;Let us calmly examine this point.</P>
<P>The argument again&s;t it is drawn from the breach of the former promi&s;e. To be authori&s;ed to pre&s;s this argument, we ought to be &s;ure that all was right on our part.&mdash;After what has been offered on this &s;ubject, are we &s;till convinced that this was the ca&s;e? Are we able to &s;ay that there was nothing in our conduct which furni&s;hed a ground for that of Great Britain? Has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t not been &s;hewn to be a fact that, from the arrival of the provi&s;ional articles in this country, till after the ratification here of the definitive treaty, acts of &s;tates inter|dicting the recovery of Briti&s;h debts and other acts militating again&s;t the treaty, continued in operation? Can we doubt that &s;ubjects of Great Britain, affected by the&s;e acts, carried complaints to the ears of their government? Can we wonder if they made &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions there, if they produced di&s;&s;atisfaction and di&s;tru&s;t? Is it very extra|ordinary if they excited the idea of detaining the po&s;ts as a pledge, till there were better indications on our part? Is it &s;urpri&s;ing if the continuance of the&s;e acts and the addition of others which were new and po&s;itive breaches of the treaty, prolonged the detention of the Po&s;ts?&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="028795_0039_0FDD49E4C716F100">In fine, was the delay in &s;urrendering &s;o entirely de&s;titute of cau&s;e, &s;o unequivocal a proof of a perfidious character, as to ju&s;tify the con|clu&s;ion, that no future dependance can be made on the promi&s;es of the Briti&s;h government? Di&s;cerning men will not ha&s;tily &s;ub&s;cribe to this conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mutual charges of breach of faith are not uncommon between na|tions: yet this does not prevent their making new &s;tipulations with each other, and relying upon their performance. The argument from the breach of one promi&s;e, if real, to the breach of every other, is not &s;upported by experience, and if adopted as a general rule would multiply, infinitely the impediments to accord and agreement among nations.</P>
<P>The truth is, that though nations will too often evade their pro|mi&s;es on colourable pretexts, yet few are &s;o profligate as to do it without &s;uch pretexts. In clear ca&s;es, &s;elf intere&s;t dictates a regard to the obligations of good faith: nor is there any thing in the hi&s;tory of Great Britain which warrants the opinion that &s;he is more un|mindful than other nations of her character for good faith.</P>
<P>Yet &s;he mu&s;t be &s;o, and in an extreme degree, if &s;he be capable of breaking, without real cau&s;e, a <HI>&s;econd</HI> promi&s;e on the <HI>&s;ame</HI> point, after the termination by a new treaty of an old di&s;pute concerning it, and this too on the ba&s;is of mutual reparation. It would indicate a de&s;titution of principle, a contempt of character, much beyond the u&s;ual mea&s;ure, and to an extent which it may be affirmed is entirely improbable.</P>
<P>It is a circum&s;tance of &s;ome moment in the que&s;tion, that the &s;e|cond promi&s;e is free from the vaguene&s;s of the fir&s;t, as to the time of execution&mdash;It is not to be perfomed <HI>with all convenient &s;peed,</HI> but by a day certain, which cannot be exceeded. This would give point to violation and render it unequivocal.</P>
<P>Another argument again&s;t the probability of performance has been deduced from the &s;uppo&s;ed deficiency of good rea&s;ons for the delay, which is repre&s;ented as evidence of want of &s;incerity in the promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the rea&s;ons which were a&s;&s;igned for that delay, there are others that may be conjectured to have operated, which it would not have been equally convenient to avow, but which &s;erve to explain the delay different from the &s;uppo&s;ition of its having been calculated for ultimate eva&s;ion. If, as we have with too much cau&s;e &s;u&s;pected, Great-Britain, or her Repre&s;entative in Canada, whether with or without orders, has really countenanced the ho&s;tilities of the We&s;|tern Indians, it was to be expected that &s;he would think it incum|bent upon her to give them &s;ufficient time to make peace before an evacuation of the Po&s;ts &s;hould put them entirely in our power. She might otherwi&s;e have provoked them to ho&s;tilities again&s;t her own &s;ettlements, and have kindled in their minds, inextingui&s;hable re&s;ent|ments. It was not certain how &s;oon a peace would be brought about, and it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the di&s;po&s;ition to it on our part might be weakened or &s;trengthened by the proximity or remotene&s;s of the period of the &s;urrender. Moreover, &s;ome con&s;iderable time might be requi&s;ite to prepare the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hmments for the &s;ecurity of Canada, which the relinqui&s;hment of the Po&s;ts would be deemed to render nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The latter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> not ju&s;tly objectionable: the former im|plies
<PB N="40" REF="028795_0040_0FDD49E62A891D48">
an embarra&s;&s;ment re&s;ulting from a culpable policy, which was intitled to no indulgence from us, but which, neverthele&s;s, mu&s;t have had a pretty imperious influence on the conduct of the other party, and mu&s;t have created an ob&s;tacle to a &s;peedy &s;urrender not ea&s;y to be &s;urmounted. Taken together, we find in the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned, and in tho&s;e which may be pre&s;umed to have operated, a &s;olution of the pertinacity of Great Britain on the &s;ubject of time, without impeaching on that account, the &s;incerity of the promi&s;e to &s;urrender.</P>
<P>But we have very &s;trong holds for the performance of this promi&s;e upon the intere&s;t of Great Britain: 1&s;t. The intere&s;t which every nation has in not entirely forfeiting its reputation for honor and fide|lity. 2d. The intere&s;t which re&s;ults from the correlative &s;tipulation with regard to the indemnification for the Briti&s;h debts, a point upon which there will be no incon&s;iderable mercantile &s;en&s;ibility. 3d. The intere&s;t of pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rving peace with this country, the interruption of which, after all that has pa&s;&s;ed, could not fail to attend the non-&s;ur|render of the Po&s;ts at the &s;tipulated time.</P>
<P>It is morally certain that circum&s;tances will every day add &s;trength to this la&s;t motive.&mdash;Time has already done much for us and will do more. Every hour's continuance of the war in Europe mu&s;t nece&s;|arily add to the inconveniences of a rupture with this country, and to the motives which Great Britain mu&s;t feel to avoid an increa&s;e of the number of her enemies, to de&s;ire peace, and if obtained, to pre|&s;erve it.</P>
<P>The enemies of the treaty, upon their own calculations, can hardly di&s;pute, that if the war continues another year after the pre&s;ent the probable &s;ituation of Great Britain will be a complete &s;ecurity for her compliance with her promi&s;e to &s;urrender the po&s;ts. But let us &s;uppo&s;e that a general peace takes place in Europe this winter, what may then be the di&s;po&s;ition of Great Britain in June next, as to war or peace with this country?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, that the &s;ituation will be of all others that which is mo&s;t likely to indi&s;po&s;e her to a war with us. There is no juncture, at which war is more unwelcome to a nation, than immediately after the experience of another war, which has required great exertions, and has been expen&s;ive, bloody and calamitous. The minds of all men then dread the renewal of &s;o great an evil, and are di&s;po&s;ed rather to make &s;acrifices to peace than to plunge afre&s;h into ho&s;tilities. The &s;ituation of Great Britain at the end of the war in which &s;he is now engaged, is likely to be the mo&s;t di&s;couraging that can be ima|gined to the provocation of new wars. Here we may di&s;cover a pow|erful &s;ecurity for the performance of her &s;tipulations.</P>
<P>As to the idea of a guarantee or &s;urety for the fulfilment of the promi&s;e, it cannot be &s;eriou&s;ly believed that it was obtainable. It would have been an admi&s;&s;ion of the party that there was a well founded di&s;tru&s;t of its faith. To con&s;ent to it, therefore, would have been to &s;ub&s;cribe to its own humiliation and di&s;grace, the expec|ation of which has been &s;hewn to be ridiculous.</P>
<P>But why was there not equally good rea&s;on that we &s;hould have given a guarantee or &s;urety for the performance of our new promi&s;e with regard to the debts? And if there was to have been reciprocity, where &s;hould we have conveniently found that guarantee or &s;urety?
<PB N="41" REF="028795_0041_0FDD4A1D77642148">
Should we have thought it very reputable to our&s;elves to have been obliged to furni&s;h it?</P>
<P>The arguments of the oppo&s;ers of the treaty are extremely at vari|ance with each other. On the one hand they repre&s;ent it as fraught with advantages to Great Britain, without equivalents to the United States&mdash;as a premeditated &s;cheme to &s;acrifice our trade and navigati|on to her's&mdash;as a plan dictated by her for drawing the two countries into clo&s;e connection and alliance, and for making our intere&s;ts &s;ub|&s;ervient to her's; on the other hand, they tell us, that there is no &s;ecurity for the &s;urrender of the po&s;ts, according to &s;tipulation. How is the one thing to be reconciled with the other? If the treaty be &s;uch an immen&s;e boon to Great Britain, if it be &s;uch a ma&s;ter piece of political craft on her &s;ide, can there be any danger that &s;he will de&s;|troy her favorite work, by not performing the conditions on which its efficacy and duration mu&s;t depend? There is no po&s;ition better &s;ettled, than that the breach of any article of a treaty by one party, gives the other an option to con&s;ider the whole treaty as annulled. Would Great Britain give us this option, in a ca&s;e in which &s;he had &s;o much to lo&s;e by doing it?</P>
<P>This glaring colli&s;ion of arguments proves how &s;uperficially the adver&s;aries of the treaty have con&s;idered the &s;ubject, and how little reliance can be placed on the views they give of it.</P>
<P>In e&s;timating the plan which the treaty adopts for the &s;ettlement of the old controver&s;y, it is an important reflection, that, from the cour&s;e of things, there will be nothing to be performed by us before the period for the re&s;titution of the po&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s will have elap&s;ed, and that, if this re&s;titution &s;hould be evaded, we &s;hall be free to put an end to the whole treaty, about which there could not be a moment's he&s;ita|tion. We &s;hould then be where we were before the treaty, with the advantage of having &s;trengthened the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e, by removing every occa&s;ion of reproach, which the infractions of the treaty of peace may have furni&s;hed again&s;t us.</P>
<P>Two other particulars, in which this part of the treaty is &s;uppo&s;|ed to be defective, regard the want of indemnification for the deten|tion of the po&s;ts, and for the expences of Indian wars.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who make the objection, may be &s;afely challenged to pro|duce precedents of &s;imilar indemnifications, unle&s;s impo&s;ed by <HI>con|quering</HI> powers on the vanqui&s;hed, or by powers of overbearing &s;trength upon-tho&s;e which were too weak to di&s;pute the logic of &s;u|perior force. If this were the relative &s;ituation of the United States and Great Britain, then is the treaty inexcu&s;ably faulty; but if the parties were to treat and agree as equal powers, then is the preten&s;i|on extravagant and impracticable. The re&s;titution of the &s;pecific thing detained, is all that was to be expected, and, it may be added, it is all that was ever really expected on the part of this country, &s;o far as we may rea&s;on either from official acts or informal expre&s;&s;ions of the public opinion.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es where clear injuries are done, affecting objects of known or ea&s;ily a&s;certainable values, pecuniary compen&s;ation may be ex|pected to be obtained by negociation: but it is beleived that it will be impo&s;&s;ible to cite an example of &s;uch compen&s;ation &s;o obtained, in a ca&s;e in which territory has been withheld on a di&s;pute of title, or as a ho&s;tage for &s;ome other claim (as in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, for
<PB N="42" REF="028795_0042_0FDD49EB04814260">
&s;ecuring the performance of the 4th article of the treaty of peace.) The recovery of the territory withheld is the u&s;ual &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The want of a rule to adju&s;t con&s;equential damages, is, in &s;uch ca&s;es, a very great difficulty. In the in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ce under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, this difficulty would be peculiarly great.&mdash;The po&s;ts are, for the mo&s;t part, in a wilderne&s;s. There are but two of them which have any adjacent &s;ettlements; Point-au-fer, or Dutchman's point, to one of which a part of a tract of land, called Caldwell's Manor, with a few inhabitants, has been claimed as appurtenant. Detroit, which has a &s;ettlement in the town and neighbourhood of between two and three thou&s;and &s;ouls. In the vicinity of the other po&s;ts, on our &s;ide, there is &s;carcely an inhabitant. It follows, that very little damage could be predicated either upon the lo&s;s of revenue from, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the profits of trade with the &s;ettlements in the vicinity of the po&s;ts. The trade of the Indians within our limits would con&s;e|quently be the ba&s;is of the claim of compen&s;ation.&mdash;But here the ignorance or &s;pirit of exaggeration of the opponents of the treaty has been particularly exemplified. The annual lo&s;s from this &s;ource has been &s;tated, by a very zealous writer again&s;t the treaty, who &s;igns him&s;elf <HI>Cato,</HI> at 800,000 dollars.</P>
<P>Now it is a fact well a&s;certained, that the mean value of the whole exports from Canada in peltries (which con&s;titute the returns of In|dian trade) in the years 1785 and 1787, was &s;omething &s;hort of 800,000 dollars. It is al&s;o a fact, in which all men informed on the &s;ubject agree, that the trade with the Indians, within our limits, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><TABLE>

is not more than about one eighth of that which furni&s;hes the peltry exported from Canada. Hence the total product of our Indian trade could not be computed at more than 100,000 dollars. What pro|portion of this may be profit, is not ea&s;y to be determined; but it is certain, that the profits of that trade, from the decrea&s;e of wild animals, and the inferiority of their kinds, are not con&s;iderable.&mdash;
<PB N="43" REF="028795_0043_0FDD4A1F00C08910">
Many a&s;&s;ert, that it &s;carcely a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> longer worth following. Twenty per cent. therefore, would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">obably be a large allowance, which would bring the lo&s;s on our Indian trade, by the detention of the po&s;ts, to about 20,000, in&s;tead of 800,000 dollars per ann. as has been a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>But might not a c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of this &s;um, by way of indemnification, be encountered, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> force, by the ob&s;ervation. that there is the highe&s;t probability that the capital and labour which would have been employed to produce 20,000 dollars profit on the trade with the Indians, have been quite as productively employed in other chan|nels, and, con&s;equently, that there may have been no lo&s;s at all?</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee how erroneous the data which &s;erve to magnify claims in them&s;elves in&s;ignificant, and which, from the great uncertainty of their quantum, are expo&s;ed to &s;erious objections. Are claims like the&s;e proper &s;ubjects on which to &s;take the peace of the United States?</P>
<P>The rea&s;onablene&s;s of indemnification for the expences of Indian wars, independent of the unu&s;ual nature of the claim, might have been matter of endle&s;s debate. We might have been told, that the Indians a&s;cribe tho&s;e wars to preten&s;ions upon their lands, by virtue of treaties with the former government of the United States, impo&s;ed by violence, or contracted with partial and inadequate repre&s;entati|ons of their nation&mdash;that our own public records witne&s;s, that the proceedings of our agents, at &s;ome of tho&s;e treaties, were far from unexceptionable&mdash;that the wars complained of are to be attributed to errors in our former policy, or mi&s;management of our public agents, not to the detention of the po&s;ts&mdash;that this detention was merely an incidental circum&s;tance of di&s;advantage, in carrying on the wars not a cau&s;e of them&mdash;that it mu&s;t be problematical how much of the dura|tion or expences of tho&s;e wars are chargeable upon that detention, that the po&s;ts having been detained by way of &s;ecurity for the per|formance of the article re&s;pecting debts, there was no re&s;pon&s;ibility for collateral and ca&s;ual damages: and finally, that it is without ex|ample to claim indemnification of one nation for the expences of wars with another. Had we re&s;orted to the charge of their having in&s;tigated or prompted tho&s;e wars, they would have demed the charge, as they have repeatedly done before; and, tho' we might have been able to adduce circum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tances of &s;u&s;picion again&s;t them, they would have conte&s;ted their validity and force, and whether guilty or not, would have thought their honour concerned in avoiding the mo&s;t di&s;|tant conce&s;&s;ion of having participated in &s;o improper a bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>In every view, therefore, the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aim for indemnification was a hope|le&s;s one; and to in&s;i&s;t upon it could have an&s;wered no other purpo&s;e than to render an amicable adju&s;tment impo&s;&s;ible. No Briti&s;h mini&s;|ter would have dared to go to a Briti&s;h parliament to a&s;k provi&s;ion for &s;uch an expenditure. What, then, was to be done? Were we now or hereafter to go to war to enforce the claim? &s;uppo&s;e this done, and fifty or a hundred millions of dollars expended in the con|te&s;t, what certainty is there that we &s;hould at la&s;t accompli&s;h the object?</P>
<P>Moreover, the principle of &s;uch a war would require, that we &s;hould &s;eek indemnification for the expences of the war it&s;elf, in ad|dition to our former claim. What pro&s;pect is there, that this al&s;o
<PB N="44" REF="028795_0044_0FDD49ECCF3301A8">
would be effected? yet if not effected, it is evident that we &s;hould have made a mo&s;t wretched bargain.</P>
<P>Why did we not in&s;i&s;t on indemnification for the expences of our revolution war? Surely not becau&s;e it was le&s;s rea&s;onable, but becau&s;e it was evident that it could not have been obtained, and becau&s;e peace was nece&s;&s;ary to us as well as to our enemy. This likewi&s;e would be the end of a war undertaken to enforce the claim of indem|nification for the detention of the po&s;ts. We &s;hould at length be glad to make peace either without the indemnification &s;ought, or at be&s;t at an expence to carry on the the war, without a chance of reim|bur&s;ement, with which the thing gained would bear no compari&s;on.</P>
<P>The idea which has been thrown out of leaving the po&s;ts in the hands of the Briti&s;h, till we might be better able than at pre&s;ent to go to war for indemnification, is a notable political expedient. This would be to po&s;tpone of choice the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an object which has been &s;hewn to be demanded by very urgent and important general con&s;iderations, to &s;ubmit to certain and great inconveniences from that privation, including probably the continuance or renewal of Indian ho&s;tilities, and to run the ri&s;k, from the growth of the Briti&s;h &s;ettlements in the neighbourhood of the po&s;ts, and various unfore&s;een ca&s;ualties, of their ultimate acqui&s;ition becoming difficult and preca|rious: For what? why, to take at la&s;t the chances of war, the i&s;&s;ue of which is ever doubtful, to obtain an object which, if obtained, will certainly co&s;t more than it is worth. The expences of war apart, pecuniary indemnification upon any po&s;&s;ible &s;cale, would ill compen&s;ate for the evils of the future detention, till the more conve|nient time for going to war &s;hould arrive. What &s;hould we think of this policy, if it &s;hould turn out that the po&s;ts and the indemnifi|cation too were to be finally abandoned?</P>

<P>IT was my intention to have comprized in two numbers, the exa|mination of the &s;econd article; but on exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">riment, it was found expedient to add a third. I re&s;ume, for a moment, the &s;ubject of indenification for the detention of the Po&s;ts.</P>
<P>As an inducement to per&s;i&s;t in this claim, we are a&s;&s;ured that the magnanimity of France, would have procured for us its e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. In the fir&s;t place, this &s;uppo&s;es that we were to have become a party in the war; for otherwi&s;e it would be &s;illy to imagine, that France would on our account, embarra&s;s her&s;elf with a difficulty of this &s;ort. In this ca&s;e, and &s;uppo&s;ing the object accompli&s;hed, &s;till the injuries, lo&s;&s;es, and expences of war, would have greatly overbal|anced the advantage gained. But what certainty have we that France will be able to dictate terms, even for her&s;elf? Could we expect or rely after the terrible &amp; wa&s;ting war, in which &s;he has been engaged, that &s;he would be willing to encumber the making of peace, with ad|ditional ob&s;tacles, to &s;ecure &s;o trifling a point for us? Would it be even humane, or friendly in us to a&s;k her to ri&s;k the prolonging of her calamities, for &s;o trivial an object? A conduct like this, with re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e|ence either to France, or to our&s;elves, would re&s;emble that of the
<PB N="45" REF="028795_0045_0FDD4A2079296088">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ter, who &s;hould p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay <HI>millions</HI> again&s;t <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rthings.</HI> It is &s;o prepo|terous in every &s;en&s;e, that the recommendation of it, if he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re, ad|mits of but one con&s;truction, namely, that tho&s;e who recommend it, with our envoy to have acted, not as if he had been &s;ent <HI>to make peace,</HI> but as if he had been &s;ent <HI>to make war,</HI> to blow and &s;pread the de&s;olating flames of di&s;cord and contention.</P>
<P>There is a marked di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s running through the ob&s;ervati|ons, which are made to the prejudice of the treaty: they endeavor con&s;tantly to have it under&s;tood that our envoy abandoned, without effort, the claims which have not been e&s;tabli&s;hed? Whence is this inferred? Is it from the &s;ilence of the treaty? Surely we can only expect to find there what was <HI>agreed upon,</HI> not what was <HI>di&s;cu&s;&s;ed</HI> and <HI>rejected.</HI> The truth is, that as well on this point of indemnification, for the detention of the po&s;ts, as on that of compen&s;ation for the ne|groes carried away, our envoy urged our preten&s;ions, as far, and as long as he could do it, without making them final ob&s;tacles to the progre&s;s of the negociation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now enumerate and an&s;wer the remaining objections, which have appeared again&s;t this article. They are the&s;e:&mdash;1. That the po&s;ts to be &s;urrendered in&s;tead of being de&s;cribed in general terms, &s;hould for greater certainty, have been &s;pecifically enumerated; that now the uncertainty of a part of the boundary line, may furni&s;h a pretext for detaining &s;ome of them. 2. That the expre&s;&s;ions, "pre|cincts and juri&s;dictions," which are excepted from our right of &s;et|tlement previous to the &s;urrender are &s;o vague and indeterminate, as to be capable of being made to countenance encroachments. 3. That it was improper to have &s;tipulated, for the inhabitants, the option of re&s;iding and continuing Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, or of becoming American citizens; that the fir&s;t was to e&s;tabli&s;h by treaty, a Briti&s;h colony, within our limits; the la&s;t to admit without the power of exception bitter enemies of the country, to the privileges of citizens. 4. That the &s;ecuring to tho&s;e inhabitants, the enjoyment of their property is exceptionable as being "a&s;ce&s;&s;ion without equivalent of an <HI>indefinite extent of territory.</HI>" This is the character given to it by the meeting at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer to the fir&s;t objection is, that the enumeration propo&s;|ed might have included the very danger which is objected to the pro|vi&s;ion as it &s;tands, and which is completely avoided by it. The prin|cipal po&s;ts occupied by the Briti&s;h are known and might ea&s;ily have been enumerated; but there is a po&s;&s;ibility of there being others not known, which might have e&s;caped. La&s;t year there &s;tarted up a po&s;t which had not been before heard of, on the pre&s;ence of an old trad|ing e&s;tabli&s;hment. Who knows with ab&s;olute certainty, how many &s;imilar ca&s;es may exi&s;t in the va&s;t extent of wilderne&s;s, as far as the lake of the Woods, which for &s;everal years pa&s;t has been inacce&s;&s;ible to us? If our envoy's information could have been perfect, at the time of his la&s;t advices from America; between that period and the &s;igning of the treaty, changes might have taken place, that is, trading hou&s;es might have grown into military po&s;ts, as they did in the ca&s;e referred to; a ca&s;e, which in fact, happened after the departured of our envoy from the United States. Was it not far better than to hazard an imperfect &s;pecification to u&s;e terms &s;o general and com|prehen&s;ive, as could not fall in any circum&s;tances, to embrace every ca&s;e; Certainly it was; and the terms "<HI>all po&s;ts and places,</HI>" which
<PB N="46" REF="028795_0046_0FDD49EE50D53828">
are tho&s;e u&s;ed in the article, are thus comprehen&s;ive. Nothing can e&s;cape them.</P>
<P>Neither is there the lea&s;t danger that the uncertainty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This uncertainty is to be ob&s;erved, re&s;ults not from the late treaty, but from the treaty of peace. It is occa&s;ioned by its being unknown whether any part of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi extends far enough north to be inter&s;ected by a due we&s;t line from the lake of the Woods.</NOTE> of a part of the boundary line, can be made a pretext for detaining any po&s;t which it was po&s;&s;ible to enumerate. This will appear from an in|&s;pection of the map. The only uncertain part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndary line (except that depending on the river St. C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ix, which is on a &s;ide un|connected with the po&s;ition of the Po&s;ts) is that which is to run from the lake of the Woods to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi. The mo&s;t we&s;tern of our known po&s;ts is at Michillimacnac, at or near the junction of the lakes Huron and Michegan, ea&s;tward near eleven degrees of longitude of the lake of the Woods, and about ten degrees of longitude of that point, on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, below the fails of St. Anthony, where a &s;ur|vey, in order to a &s;ettlement of the line is to begin. Moreover our line by the treaty of peace, is to pa&s;s through the middle of lake Huron, and the water communication between that lake and lake Superior, and through the middle of lake Superior, and thence we&s;t|ward through other waters to the lake of the Woods; that is about half a degree of latitude more northward, and about eight degrees of latitude more we&s;tward, than any part of lake Michegan.&mdash;Whence it is manife&s;t, that any clo&s;ing line, to be drawn from the lake of the Woods to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, mu&s;t pa&s;s at a di&s;tance of &s;everal hun|dred miles from Michillimacnac. If the Briti&s;h therefore, &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to evade the &s;urrender, they will &s;eek for it &s;ome pre|text, more plau&s;ible than one which involves a palpable geographical ab&s;urdity. Nor can we de&s;ire a better proof of the di&s;ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of the objectors to the treaty, than their having contrived one of this nature.</P>
<P>The general terms u&s;ed were to be preferred, for the very rea|&s;on, that there was a doubt about the cour&s;e of a part of the boun|dary line; for if there &s;hould chance to exi&s;t any po&s;t, now unknown, &s;o near that line as to render it que&s;tionable, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, on which &s;ide it may fall; the moment the line is &s;ettled, the obligation to &s;urrender will be &s;ettled with it.</P>
<P>The &s;econd obligation lo&s;es all force, when it is con&s;idered that the exception can only operate till the 1&s;t of June next, the period for the &s;urrender of the po&s;ts; and that in the mean time, there is ample &s;pace for &s;ettlement, without coming to di&s;putable ground. There was be&s;ides real difficulty in an accurate definition. What the pre|cincts and juri&s;diction of the po&s;ts are, is a que&s;tion of fact. In &s;ome in&s;tances, where from there being no &s;ettlements, over which an actual juri&s;diction had been exerci&s;ed, a good rule might have been the di&s;tance of gun &s;hot from the fortifications, which might have been &s;ettled at a certain extent in miles, &s;ay three or four.&mdash; But in &s;ome ca&s;es, an actual juri&s;diction has been exerci&s;ed under circum&s;tances which created ob&s;tacles to a preci&s;e definition.&mdash; The ca&s;e of Caldwell's manor in the vicinity of Dutchman's point is an example. There a mixed juri&s;diction has been &s;ometimes ex|erci&s;ed
<PB N="47" REF="028795_0047_0FDD4A21C9793778">
by the Briti&s;h and by the &s;tate of Vermont, connected with a di&s;puted title to that manor; one party claiming under an ancient French grant, the other under the &s;tate of Vermont. Detroit and its vicinity would al&s;o have occa&s;ioned embarra&s;&s;ment. From the &s;ituation of the &s;ettlements, and of a number of di&s;per&s;ed trading e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, a latitude was likely to have been required, to which it might have been inexpedient to give a &s;anction. In &s;uch &s;ituations, where a thing is to la&s;t but a &s;hort time, it is commonly the mo&s;t eligible cour&s;e to avoid definition. It is obvious, that no ill can re&s;ult from the want of one, if the po&s;ts are &s;urrendered at the time agreed; if not, it is equally plain that it can be of no con&s;equence, becau&s;e the whole article will be void.</P>
<P>The third objection becomes in&s;ignificant, the moment the real &s;tate of things is adver&s;ed to. This has been de&s;cribed in a former number for another purpo&s;e, but will now be recapitulated with one or two additional facts. The fir&s;t po&s;ts beginning ea&s;tward are point Aufer, and Dutchman's point on lake Champlain. The whole num|ber of per&s;ons in this vicinity, over whom juri&s;diction has been claim|ed by the Briti&s;h, may amount to an hundred families. But the claim of juri&s;diction here, has been only occa&s;ionally and feebly urg|ed; and it is a&s;&s;erted, in addition, by well informed per&s;ons, that the above mentioned families have been, for &s;ome time, regularly repre&s;ented in the legi&s;lature of Vermont, the ordinary civil juri&s;dic|tion of which &s;tate, has, with little interruption, extended over them. At neither of the other po&s;ts, to wit: O&s;wego, Niagara, the Miami Detroit, Michillimacnac; is there any &s;ettlement except at Detroit, where, and in the vicinity of which, there may be between two and three thou&s;and per&s;ons, chiefly French Canadians, and their de&s;cendants. It will be under&s;tood, that I do not con&s;ider as a &s;et|tlement, two or three log-hou&s;es for traders.</P>
<P>It follows, that the number of per&s;ons who can be embraced by the privileges &s;tipulated is too incon&s;iderable to admit of attaching any political con&s;equence whatever to the &s;tipulation. Of what impor|tance can it po&s;&s;ibly be to the United States, whether two or three thou&s;and per&s;ons, men, women, and children, are permitted to re&s;ide within their limits, either as Briti&s;h or American &s;ubjects, at their option? If the thing was an object of de&s;ire to Great Britain for the accommodation of the individuals concerned, could it have merited a moments he&s;itation on our part? As to re&s;idence, it is of the ordi|nary curte&s;y of nations at peace to permit the mutual re&s;idence of the citizens of each other within their re&s;pective territories. Briti&s;h &s;ubjects are now free by our laws, to re&s;ide in all parts of the United States. As to the permi&s;&s;ion to become citizens, it has been the ge|neral policy and practice of our country to facilitate the naturalizati|on of foreigners. And we may &s;afely count on the intere&s;t of the in|dividuals, and on that de&s;ire to enjoy equal rights which is &s;o deeply implanted in the human brea&s;t, that all who re&s;olve to make their permanent re&s;idence with us will become citizens.</P>
<P>It is true, that there may be a few obnoxious characters (though I do not recollect to have heard of more than two or three) among the number of tho&s;e who have acquired by the &s;tipulation a right to be|come citizens of the United States. But would it ever have been worthy of the dignity of the national wrath, to have launched its

And if this had not been done, would they not have found means, if they de&s;ired it, after the lap&s;e of a &s;hort period, to ac|quire the rights of citizens? It is to be ob&s;erved, that citizens of our own, who may have commited crimes again&s;t our laws, not re|mitted by the treaty of peace, would find no protection, under this article.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the &s;tipulation had not been made, what would have been the probable policy of the United States? Would it not have been to leave the handful of &s;ettlers undi&s;turbed, in quiet enjoyment of their property, and at liberty, if Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, to continue &s;uch, or become American citizens, on the u&s;ual conditions? A &s;y&s;tem of depopulation, or of coercion to one allegiance or another, would have been little congenial with our modes of thinking, and would not, am per&s;uaded, have been attempted.</P>
<P>If then, the treaty only &s;tipulates in this re&s;pect, what would have been the cour&s;e of things without it; what cau&s;e for &s;erious objec|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n can there be on this account?</P>
<P>The matter of the fourth objection can only derive a moment's im|portance from mi&s;apprehen&s;ion. It &s;eems to have been imagined, that there are large tracts of land held under Briti&s;h grants, made &s;ince the peace, which are confirmed by the part of the article that gives the inhabitants the right of removing with, &s;elling, or <HI>retaining</HI> their property.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is to be ob&s;erved, that if &s;uch grants had been made, the &s;tipulation could not be deemed to confirm them, becau&s;e our lands mu&s;t determine the que&s;tion, what is the property of the inhabitants, and they would rightfuly decide, that the Briti&s;h go|vernment, &s;ince the treaty of peace could make no valid grants of land, within our limits. Upon the ground even of its own preten&s;i|ons it could not have made &s;uch grants. Nothing more was claim|ed, than a right to detain the po&s;ts as a ho&s;tage. The right to grant lands pre-&s;uppo&s;es much more, a full right of &s;overeignty and ter|ritory.</P>
<P>But in the &s;econd place, it has always been under&s;tood, and upon recent and careful enquiry is confirmed, <HI>that the Briti&s;h government has never, &s;ince the peace made a &s;ingle grant of lands within our limits.</HI> It appears, indeed, to have been its policy to prevent &s;ettlements in the vicinity of the po&s;ts.</P>
<P>Hence the &s;tipulation as it affects lands, does nothing more than confirm the property of tho&s;e which were holden at the treaty of peace; neither is the quantity con&s;iderable; and it chiefly, if not al|together, depends on titles acquired under the French government while Canada was a province of France.</P>
<P>In giving this confirmation, the treaty only pur&s;ues what is a con|&s;tant rule among civilized nations. When territory is ceded or yield|ed up by one nation to another it is a common practice, if not a &s;pecial condition, to leave the inhabitants in the enjoyment of their property. A contrary conduct would be di&s;graceful to a nation; nor is it very reputable to the objectors to the treaty, that they have
<PB N="49" REF="028795_0049_0FDD4A26EB164DD0">
levelled their battery again&s;t this part of it. It is a reflection upon them too, that they employ for the purpo&s;e, terms which import more than is true, even on their own &s;uppo&s;ition, and are, therefore, calcu|lated to deceive; for the confirmation of property to individuals, could be at mo&s;t a ce&s;&s;ion only of the right of &s;oil, and not of terri|tory, which term has a technical &s;en&s;e including juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>Let it be added, that the treaty of peace in the article which pro|vides, "that there &s;hould be no future confi&s;cations nor pro&s;ecuti|ons again&s;t any per&s;on or per&s;ons, by rea&s;on of the part which he or they might have taken in the war; and that no per&s;on &s;hould, on that account, &s;uffer any future lo&s;s or damage, either in his per&s;on, liberty or property, did &s;ub&s;tantially what is made an objection to the treaty under con&s;ideration. It will not, I believe, be di&s;puted, that it gave protection to all property antecedently owned, and not con|fi&s;cated. Indeed, it is a que&s;tion, whether the &s;tipulations cited would not have effected, with regard to other rights than tho&s;e of property, a great part of what is regulated by the la&s;t treaty. Its provi&s;ions, in this particular, were perhaps in the main, unnece&s;&s;ary, further than to obviate a doubt which might have ari&s;en from the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the treaty by the withholding of the po&s;ts.</P>
<P>Thus have I gone through every objection to the &s;econd article, which can be deemed is colourable, and I flatter my&s;elf have &s;hewn not only that the acqui&s;ition made by it is of great and real value, but that it &s;tands as well as circum&s;tances permitted, and is defen&s;ible in its details. I have been the more particular in the examination, be|cau&s;e the a&s;&s;ailants of the treaty have exerted all their ingenuity to di&s;credit this article, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, to doubt, that it is a very valuable item of the treaty; and that it was important to their cau&s;e to envelope it in as thick a cloud of objections as they were able to contrive. As an expedient of party, there is &s;ome merit in the arti|fice; but a &s;en&s;ible people will &s;ee that it is merely artifice. It is a fal&s;e calculation, that the people of this country can ever be ulti|mately deceived.</P>

<P>THE object of the 3d article is connected with that of the 2d. The &s;urrender of the po&s;ts naturally drew with it an arrangement with regard to inland trade and navigation. Such an arrangement, conve|nient in &s;everal re&s;pects, appears to be in &s;ome re&s;pects nece&s;&s;ary. To re&s;train the Indians on either &s;ide of the line, from trading with the one party or the other, at di&s;cretion, be&s;ides the que&s;tionable|ne&s;s of the right, could not be attempted without rendering them di&s;gu&s;ted and ho&s;tile. The truth of this &s;eems to have influenced the conduct of Great-Britain and France, while the latter was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Canada. The 15th art. of the treaty of peace of Utrecht, in the year 1713, allows free liberty to the Indians on each &s;ide, to re&s;ort for trade to the Briti&s;h and French colonies. It is to be ob&s;erved too, that the Indians not only in&s;i&s;t on a right of going to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e with
<PB N="50" REF="028795_0050_0FDD49F3C6BE8830">
whom they plea&s;e, but of permitting whom they plea&s;e to come to trade with them, and al&s;o to re&s;ide among them for that purpo&s;e. Thus the &s;outhern and &s;outh we&s;tern Indians within our limits, main|tain a con&s;tant intercour&s;e with Spain, e&s;tabli&s;hed on the ba&s;is of treaty; nor has their right to do it, been hitherto conte&s;ted by the United States&mdash;indeed, on what clear principle of ju&s;tice could this natural right to trade of a people not &s;ubject to our ordinary juri&s;|diction be di&s;puted? This claim on their part, gives a corre&s;ponding claim to neighbouring nations to trade with them.&mdash;Spain would think the preten&s;ion to exclude her inadmi&s;ible&mdash;And Great-Britain would have thought the &s;ame, if &s;he had found it her intere&s;t to a&s;&s;ert the right of intercour&s;e; views which would always be &s;econded by the Indian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from regard to their own intere&s;t and independence. It was a point, therefore, which it much concerned the pre&s;ervation of good under&s;tanding between the parties and with the Indians, to regu|late on &s;ome equitable plan; and the more liberal the plan, the more agreeable to a natural cour&s;e of things, and to the free participation of mutual advantages, the more likely was it to promote and prolong that important benefit.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, the expediency of &s;ome arrangement was indi|cated by the circum&s;tance of the boundary line, between the parties, running for an extent of &s;ixteen hundred miles through the middle of the &s;ame rivers, lakes and waters. It may be deemed impo&s;&s;ible from the varying cour&s;e of winds and currents, for the ve&s;&s;els of one party to keep them&s;elves con&s;tantly within their own limits, without pa&s;&s;ing or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e of the other. How, indeed, was the preci&s;e middle line of tho&s;e great lakes to be always known.</P>
<P>It appears evident, that to render the navigation of the&s;e waters u&s;eful to, and &s;afe for both parties, it was requi&s;ite that they &s;hould be common. Without this, frequent forfeitures to enforce inter|dictions of intercour&s;e might be incurred&mdash;and there would be con&s;tant danger of interference and controver&s;y. It is probable too, that when tho&s;e waters are better explored in their whole extent, it will be found that the be&s;t navigation of the lakes is &s;ometimes on the one &s;ide, &s;ometimes on the other, and that common convenience will, in this re&s;pect al&s;o, be promoted by community of right.</P>
<P>Again, it is almo&s;t always mutually beneficial for bordering terri|tories to have free and friendly intercour&s;e with each other. This relates not only to the advantages of an interchange of commodities, for the &s;upply of mutual wants and to tho&s;e of the reciprocal reacti|on of indu&s;try, connected with that interchange, but al&s;o to tho&s;e of avoiding jealou&s;y, colli&s;ion, and conte&s;t, of pre&s;erving friend&s;hip and harmony. Proximity of territory invites to trade&mdash;the border|ing inhabitants, in &s;pite of every prohibition, will endeavour to carry it on&mdash;If not allowed, illicit adventurers take place of the regular operations of legali&s;ed commerce&mdash;individual intere&s;t, leads to collu|&s;ions to evade re&s;training regulations&mdash;habits of infracting the laws are produced&mdash;morals are perverted&mdash;&s;everities nece&s;&s;arily great in proportion, as they counteract the natural cour&s;e of things, lay the foundation of di&s;contents and quarrels. Perhaps it may be &s;afely af|firmed that, freedom of intercour&s;e or violent hatred and enmity, are the alternative in every ca&s;e of contiguity of territory.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="028795_0051_0FDD4A27F639E988">The maxims of the United States have hitherto favoured a free intercour&s;e with all the world. They have conceived that they had nothing to fear from the unre&s;trained competition of commercial enterpri&s;e, and have only de&s;ired to be admited to it on equal terms. Hence not only the communication by &s;ea has been open, with the adjacent territories, on our continent, as well as with more di&s;tant quarters of the globe, but two ports have been erected on lake Cham|plain for the convenience of interior commerce with Canada. The&s;e arrangements have excited neither blame nor critici&s;m.</P>
<P>Our envoy, therefore, in agreeing to a liberal plan of intercour&s;e with the Briti&s;h territories in our neighbourhood has conformed to the general &s;pirit of our country, and to the general policy of our laws. Great Britain, in acceding to &s;uch a plan, departed from her &s;y&s;tem of colonial monopoly, a departure which ought to be one recommendation of the plan to us; for every relaxation of that &s;y&s;|tem payes the way for other and further relaxations. It might have been expected al&s;o, that a &s;pirit of jealou&s;y might have proved an ob&s;tacle on the part of great Britain, &s;ince, e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider the compo&s;ition of tho&s;e who inhabit, and are likely to inhabit Ca|nada, it is morally certain that there mu&s;t be, as the re&s;ult of a free intercour&s;e a far greater momentum of influence of the United States upon Canada, than of Canada upon the United States.&mdash;It would not have been &s;urpri&s;ing, if this jealou&s;y had &s;ought to keep us at a di&s;|ance, &amp; had counteracted the wi&s;er policy of limiting our de&s;ires by giving us po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what is alone to us truly de&s;ireable, the advan|tages of commerce, rather than of &s;uffering our wi&s;hes to be &s;timu|lated and extended by privation and re&s;traint.</P>
<P>New ideas &s;eem of late to have made their way among us. The extremes of commercial jealou&s;y are inculcated.&mdash;Regulation, re|&s;triction, exclu&s;ion, are now with many the favourite topics&mdash;In&s;tead of feeling plea&s;ure, that new avenues of trade are opened, a thou|&s;and dangers and mi&s;chiefs are pourtrayed when the occa&s;ion occurs. Free trade with all the world &s;eems to have dwindled into trade with France and her dominions.&mdash;The love &s;ick partizans of that country appear to regard her as the epitome of the univer&s;e, and to have adopted for their motto, "All for love, and the world well lo&s;t."</P>
<P><HI>The&s;e new propen&s;ities towards commercial jealou&s;y have been remark|ably exemplified with re&s;pect to the article immediately under con&s;ideration. Truly e&s;timated, it is a valuable in gredient in the treaty; and yet there is perhaps, no part of it which has been more &s;everely reprobated&mdash;It will be ea&s;y to &s;hew that it has been extremely mi&s;repre&s;ented, and that what have been deemed very exceptionable features, do not exi&s;t at all.</HI></P>

particularly that it does not reach at all our atlantic ports. An in&s;tance of one of the &s;pecial provi&s;ions alluded to, will be cited in the further exa|mination of this article.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In oppo&s;ition to this con&s;truction, much &s;tre&s;s is laid upon the provi&s;i|ons which immediately &s;ucceed the clau&s;es that have been quoted. They are in the&s;e words: "But it is under&s;tood that this article does not ex|tend to the admi&s;&s;ion of ve&s;&s;els of the United States into the &s;eaports, harbours, bays or creeks of his maje&s;t's &s;aid territories, nor into &s;uch parts of the rivers in his &s;aid territories, as are between the mouth thereof, and the highe&s;t port of entry from the &s;ea, except in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els trading bona fide between Montreal and Quebec: nor to the admi&s;&s;ion of Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els from the &s;ea, into the rivers of the United States, beyond the highe&s;t ports of entry for foreign ve&s;&s;els from the &s;ea." The la&s;t, it is &s;aid, con|tains an implication that under this article, Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els have a right to come to our highe&s;t ports of entry for foreign ve&s;&s;els from the &s;ea while we are excluded from the &s;ea ports of the Briti&s;h territories on this continent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But this is altogether an erroneous inference. The clau&s;es la&s;t cited are in&s;erted for greater caution, to guard expre&s;sly again&s;t any con|&s;truction of the article, by implications more or le&s;s remote; contrary to the actual regulations of the parties, with regard to external commerce and navigation. Great Britain does not now permit a trade by &s;ea to Nova Scotia and Canada. She therefore declares that the article &s;hall not be deemed to contravene this regulation. The United States now permit foreign ve&s;&s;els to some to certain port of entry from the &s;ea, but exclude them from other more interior parts of entry, to which our own ve&s;&s;els may come.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An example of this is found in the &s;tate of New-York. Foreign ve&s;&s;els can only enter and unlade at the city of New-York; ve&s;&s;els of the United States may enter at the city of Hud&s;on, and unlade there and at Albany.</NOTE><HI>It is therefore declared on their part, that the article &s;hall not be con&s;trued to contravene this regulation. This was the more proper, as the right of inland navigation might have given &s;ome color to the claim of going from an outer to an inner port of entry. But this negative of an implication, which might have found &s;ome color in the principal provi&s;ion, can never be con&s;trued into an affirmative grant of a very important privilege, foreign to that principal provi&s;ion. The main object of the article it has been &s;een, is trade b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> land, and inland navi|gation. Trade and navigation by &s;ea, with our &s;ea ports, is an entirely different thing. To infer a po&s;itive grant of this privilege, from a clau&s;e which &s;ays, that the right of inland navigation &s;hall not be con&s;trued to permit ve&s;&s;els coming from the &s;ea, to go from the ports of entry, to which our laws now re&s;trict them, to more interior ports, would be con|trary to rea&s;on, and to every rule of &s;ound con&s;truction. Such a privi|lege could never be permitted to be founded upon any thing le&s;s than a po&s;itive and explicit grant. It could never be &s;upported by an implication drawn from an article relative to a local and partial object; much le&s;s by an implication drawn from the negative of another implication. The preten&s;ion, that all our ports were laid open to Great Britain by a covert and &s;ide wind provi&s;ion, and this without reciprocity, without a right of acce&s;s to a &s;ingle &s;ea-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ort of the other party in any part of the world,

would be too mon&s;trous to be tolerated for an in&s;tant. The principles of equity between nations, and the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules of interpretation would unite to condemn &s;o great an inequality, if any other &s;en&s;e could po&s;&s;ibly be found for the terms from which it might be pretended to be deduced. It would be in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e the more inadmi&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e the object is embraced and regulated by other parts of the treaty on terms of recipro|city.</HI></P>
<P>The different mode of expre&s;&s;ion, in the clau&s;e la&s;t cited, when &s;peaking of the Briti&s;h territories, and when &s;peaking of the United States, has furni&s;hed an argument for the inference which has been &s;tated. But this difference is accounted for by the difference in the actual regulations of the parties as de&s;cribed above. The object was on each &s;ide to OUST an implication interfering with tho&s;e regulati|ons. The expre&s;&s;ions to effect it were commen&s;urate with the &s;tate of the fact on each &s;ide; and con&s;equently do not warrant any col|lateral or &s;pecial inference.</P>
<P>The only po&s;itive effect of the&s;e clau&s;es is to e&s;tabli&s;h, that naviga|tion from Montrealto Quebec, &s;hall be carried on in what are called "&s;mall ve&s;&s;els trading bona fide between Montreal and Quebec." In determining their &s;en&s;e, it merits &s;ome ob&s;ervation, that they do not profe&s;s to except from the operation of the general provi&s;ions of the article, the &s;ea ports, &amp;c. of the Briti&s;h territories; but declare, that it is under&s;tood that tho&s;e provi&s;ions do not extend to them. This is more a declaration that the antecedent provi&s;ions were not &s;o broad as to comprehend the ca&s;es, than an exception of the ca&s;es from the operation of tho&s;e provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are not familiar with laws &amp; treaties may feel &s;ome difficulty about the po&s;ition, that particular clau&s;es are introduced, only for greater caution, without producing any new effect; but tho&s;e who are familiar with &s;uch &s;ubjects, know, that there is &s;carcely a law or a treaty which does not offer examples of the u&s;e of &s;imilar clau&s;es, and it not unfrequently happens, that a clear meaning of the principal provi&s;ion is rendered ob&s;cure by the exce&s;s of explanatory precaution.</P>
<P>The next clau&s;e of this article is an exception to the general de&s;ign of it, confirming the con&s;truction I have given. "The river Mi&s;&s;i|&s;ippi, &s;hall, however, according to the treaty of peace, be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports and places on its ea&s;tern &s;ide, to which &s;oever of the parties belonging, may freely be re&s;orted to and u&s;ed by both parties, in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places of the United States, or any of the ports or places of his maje&s;ty in Great Britain."</P>
<P>If the general provi&s;ion gives acce&s;s to all our ports, which mu&s;t be the doctrine, if it gives acce&s;s to our Atlantic ports, then it would equally have this effect with regard to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi. But this clau&s;e clearly implies the contrary, not only by introducing a &s;pecial pro|vi&s;ion for the ports of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, but by introducing it expre&s;sly, as a further or additional agreement; the words are "it is further agreed, &amp;c." and the&s;e ports are to be enjoyed by each party "in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places of the Unit|ed States, or any of the ports or places of his maje&s;ty in Great Bri|tain." This reference to our Atlantic ports, coupling them with the ports of Great Britain, &s;hews that the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi ports are to be re|gulated
<PB N="55" REF="028795_0055_0FDD4A2AF5FF49B8">
by a rule or &s;tandard different from the ports for that inland navigation, which is the general object of the article; el&s;e, why that &s;pecial reference? why not have &s;topped at the words "u&s;ed by both parties?" If it be &s;aid, that the reference to our Atlantic ports implies, that they are within the purview of the article, let it be ob|&s;erved that the &s;ame argument would prove that the ports of Great Britain are al&s;o within its purview, which is plainly erroneous, for the main provi&s;ions are expre&s;sly confined to the territories of the parties on this continent. The conclu&s;ion is, that the reference is to a &s;tandard out of the article, and depending on other parts of the treaty.</P>
<P>It may be u&s;eful to ob&s;erve here, that the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi ports being to be u&s;ed only in as ample, and not in a more ample manner, than our Atlantic ports and the ports of Great Britain will be liable at all times to all the regulations, privileges and re&s;trictions of the ports with which they are a&s;&s;orted.</P>
<P>The next clau&s;e is a &s;till further refutation of the con&s;truction which I oppo&s;e. "All goods and merchandize, who&s;e importation into his Maje&s;ty's &s;aid territories in America &s;hall not be entirely pro|hibited, may freely, for the purpo&s;es of commerce, be carried into the &s;ame in the manner afore&s;aid, by the citizens of the United States; and &s;uch goods and merchandize &s;hall be &s;ubject to no high|er or other duties than would be payable by his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects on the importation of the &s;ame from Europe into the &s;aid territories: And in like manner, all goods and merchandize, who&s;e importation into the United States &s;hall not be wholly prohibited, may freely, for the purpo&s;es of commerce, be carried into the &s;ame in the manner afore&s;aid, &s;ubject to no higher or other duties than would be paya|ble by the citizens of the United States, on the importation of the &s;ame in American ve&s;&s;els into the Atlantic ports of the &s;aid States: and all goods not prohibited to be exported from the &s;aid territories re&s;pectively, may, in like manner, be carried out of the &s;ame by the two parties re&s;pectively paying duty as afore&s;aid."</P>
<P>The words, "in the manner a fore&s;aid," occur twice in the&s;e clau&s;es, and their equivalent, "in like manner" once. What is the meaning of this &s;o often repeated phra&s;e? it cannot be pre&s;umed that it would have been in&s;erted &s;o frequently without having to per|form &s;ome office of con&s;equence. I an&s;wer, that it is evidently the &s;ub&s;titute for the&s;e other words of the main provi&s;ion, "by land and inland navigation." This is "the manner afore&s;aid."&mdash;This is the channel, through which goods and merchandizes pa&s;&s;ing, would be &s;ubject to no other or higher duties than would be payable in the Briti&s;h territories by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, if imported from Europe, in the territories of the United States, by citizens of the United States, if brought by American ve&s;&s;els into our Atlantic ports. No other rea&s;onable u&s;e can be found for the terms. If they are denied this &s;en&s;e, they had much better been omitted, as being not only u&s;ele&s;s, but as giving cau&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e a re&s;triction of what, it is pretended, was de&s;igned to be general&mdash;a right of importing in every way, and into all parts of the United States, goods and merchandize, if not intirely prohibited, on the &s;ame duties as are payable by our own citizens when brought in our own ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The words," who&s;e importation into the United States &s;hall not
<PB N="56" REF="028795_0056_0FDD49F81EAA99E8">
be <HI>entirely</HI> prohibited," is a further key to the true &s;en&s;e of the article. They are equivalent to the&s;e other words, "who&s;e importation <HI>into all parts</HI> of the United States &s;hall not be prohibited."&mdash;The de&s;ign of this clau&s;e is to prevent importation, thro' the particular channels contemplated by the article, being ob&s;tructed by a partial or by any other than a general prohibition. As long as certain goods may be introduced into the United States through the Atlantic ports, they may al&s;o be brought into them through the channels de&s;ignated by this article, that is, by land and inland navigation. The making a prohibition in the given ca&s;e to depend on a general prohibition, is conclu&s;ive to prove, that the article contemplates only <HI>particular chan|nels.</HI> On any other &s;uppo&s;ition the clau&s;e is non&s;en&s;e. The true reading, then, of this part of the article mu&s;t be as follows:&mdash;"Goods and merchandize, who&s;e importation <HI>into all parts</HI> of the United States &s;hall not be prohibited, may freely, for the purpo&s;e of commerce, be carried into the &s;ame by <HI>land and inland navigation,</HI> from the terri|tories of his Maje&s;ty on the continent of America."</P>
<P>There are &s;till other expre&s;&s;ions in the article, which are likewi&s;e an index to its meaning. They are the&s;e, "<HI>would be payable</HI> by the citizens of the United States on the <HI>importation of the &s;ame in American ve&s;&s;els into the Atlantic ports of the &s;aid States.</HI>" This reference to a rate of duties, which would be payable on importation into the Atlantic ports, as a rule or guide for the rate of duties, which is to prevail in the ca&s;e meant to be comprehended in the article, is full evidence that importation into the Atlantic ports is not included in that ca&s;e. The mention of importation in American ve&s;&s;els confirms this con|clu&s;ion, as it &s;hews that the article it&s;elf contemplates that the di&s;|crimination made by our exi&s;ting laws may continue.</P>
<P>But the matter is put out of all doubt by tho&s;e parts of the fifteenth article which re&s;erve to the Briti&s;h government the right of impo&s;ing &s;uch duty as may be adequate to <HI>countervail the difference</HI> of the duty <HI>now payable</HI> on the importation of European and A&s;iatic goods, when imported in the United States in Briti&s;h and in American ve&s;&s;els. And which &s;tipulate that "the United States will not ENCREASE <HI>the now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting difference</HI> between the duties payable on the importation of any articles in Briti&s;h or in American ve&s;&s;els."</P>
<P>This is demon&s;tration, that the treaty contemplates, as con&s;i&s;tent with it, a continuance of the pre&s;ent difference of duties on impor|tations in American and Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, and con&s;equently that the third article, which &s;tipulates equal duties, as to the ca&s;es within it, does not extend to importations into our Atlantic ports, but is con|fined to importations by land and inland navigation. Though this article be of temporary duration yet as an evidence of the &s;en&s;e of parties, it will always &s;erve as a rule of con&s;truction for every part of the in&s;trument.</P>
<P>The&s;e different views of the article e&s;tabli&s;h beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, that, except with regard to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, inland trade and navigation are its &s;ole objects&mdash;that it grants no right or privilege whatever in our Atlantic ports&mdash;and that with regard to the ports of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, it only e&s;tabli&s;hes this principle, that Great Britain &s;hall always enjoy there the &s;ame privileges which by treaty or law &s;he is allowed to have in our Atlantic ports.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="028795_0057_0FDD4A2FD36F4FB0">I remark incidentally, for a purpo&s;e which will appear hereafter, that as far as this article is concerned, we are free to prohibit the importation into the United States at large of any Briti&s;h article what|ever though we cannot prohibit its importation <HI>partially,</HI> that is merely from her territories in our neighbourhood by land or inland navigation, but we may prohibit the importation by &s;ea from tho&s;e territories; <HI>nor is there any other part of the treaty by which this is prevented.</HI></P>
<P>The remaining clau&s;es of this article e&s;tabli&s;h the following points." That no duty of entry &s;hall be levied by either party on pehries brought by land or inland navigation, into the re&s;pective territories;" that Indians pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing with their own goods, &s;hall pay no impo&s;t or duty upon them, but goods in bales, or other large packages, unu&s;ual among Indians, &s;hall not be con&s;idered as their goods, that tolls and rates of ferriage &s;hall be the &s;ame on both &s;ides as are paid by natives&mdash;that no duties &s;hall be paid by either party on the mere tran&s;it of goods acro&s;s portages and carrying places from one part to another of the territory of the &s;ame party, that the re&s;|pective governments will promote friend&s;hip, good neighbourhood and amicable intercour&s;e, by cau&s;ing &s;peedy and impartial ju&s;tice to be done, and nece&s;&s;ary protection to be extended to all who may be concerned therein.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this paper with an ob&s;ervation or two on the mean|ing of the terms, inland navigation. The&s;e terms have no technical meaning defined in the laws of either country, nor have they any preci&s;e meaning a&s;&s;igned by the law of nations. They however <HI>exvi termini,</HI> exclude navigation from the &s;ea; and as a general rule, I &s;hould &s;ay, that inland navigation begins there, where &s;ea navigati|on ends. Where is this? I an&s;wer, at the ports of entry from the &s;ea. By the laws of Great Britain and of the United States, all rivers are arms of the &s;ea, as far as the ordinary tides flow&mdash;It would be a con&s;equence of this principle, that &s;ea navigation would reach to the head of tide water. But &s;ome more obvious and notorious rule ought to govern the interpretation of national compacts. The ports of entry from the &s;ea are conceived to be the proper rule.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e under con&s;ideration, the general &s;pirit of the article may require that all the waters which divide the territories of the parties &s;hould be in their whole extent common to both&mdash;As to other communicating waters acce&s;&s;ible under the article, the reciprocal limit of the right will be the ports of entry from the &s;ea. This is to be under&s;tood with the exception of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, to the ports of which acce&s;s from the &s;ea is granted under the qualification which has been pointed out.</P>

<P>THE foregoing analy&s;is of the third article, by fixing its true meaning, enables us to detect &s;ome gro&s;s errors, which have been principal &s;ources of prejudices again&s;t it.&mdash;One of the&s;e is,
<PB N="58" REF="028795_0058_0FDD49F9906E0A18">
that the article gives to the other party a right of acce&s;s to all our ports, while it excludes us from the ports of the Briti&s;h territories in our neighbourhood. It has been clearly &s;hewn, that it gives no right of acce&s;s to any one of our atlantic ports, and that it gives only a qualified and conditional acce&s;s to the ports which we may have on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi to be regulated by the privileges at any time allowed by law or compact in our atlantic ports, and liable to cea&s;e with the ce&s;&s;ation of tho&s;e privileges. The charge therefore of want of reciprocity in this particular vani&s;hes, and with it all the exceptionable con&s;equences which have been the fruit of the error. Such is the a&s;&s;ertion of Decius, that a Briti&s;h trader may &s;et out for Canada, traver&s;e our lakes, rivers and waters to New-York, and thence to Philadephia, while we are precluded from the navigation of the St. Lawrence, and other Briti&s;h rivers lower than the highe&s;t ports of entry from the &s;ea. It would be an indulgent con&s;truction of the article not to &s;top the Briti&s;h trader at Hud&s;on, as the highe&s;t port of entry from the &s;ea, and the boundary of inland navigation, but he could certainly have no claim of right under it, to go from New-York to Philadelphia, becau&s;e he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily go by &s;ea to arrive at the fir&s;t place, and no &s;uch permi&s;&s;ion is &s;tipulated by the article. Such al&s;o is the a&s;&s;ertion of Cato, that Great Eritain is ad|mitted to all the advantages of which our atlantic rivers are &s;u&s;cep|tible. The rivers upon which no part of their territory borders, and which their ve&s;&s;els can only approach by &s;ea, are certainly excepted.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P>Another of the errors referred to is this, that goods and mer|chandize may, under this article, be imported into any <HI>part</HI> of the United States, upon the &s;ame duties as are now payable when im|ported by citizens of the United States, and in ve&s;&s;els of the United States. It has been clearly proved that there is no pretence for this po&s;ition, and&mdash;that equality of duties only applies to importations from the Briti&s;h territories, in our neighbourhood, by land and inland navigation.</P>
<P>Cato, Decius, and other writers again&s;t the treaty, have fallen into this &s;trange error, and have founded upon it much angry declamati|on. The fir&s;t however, embarra&s;&s;ed in his con&s;truction, by the pro|vi&s;ion which re&s;erves to Great Britain the right of laying conter|vailing duties, endeavours to e&s;cape from it by di&s;tingui&s;hing be|tween goods imported for Indian trade, and tho&s;e imported for other u&s;es. Whatever may be the ca&s;e with regard to the latter, the former, he is convinced, are certainly entitled to admi&s;&s;ion into our atlantic ports, on the privileged rates of duty; though he is very naturally perplexed to &s;ee how the di&s;crimination could be maintain|ed in prac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e. But where does he find room for this di&s;tinction? Not in the provi&s;ion re&s;pecting countervailing duties, for that is ge|neral &mdash;not in the clau&s;e of third article, to which he gives the inter|pretation, for that is directly again&s;t his di&s;tinction. The goods and merchandize for the priviledged importation of which it provides, are re&s;tricted to no particular object&mdash;have no &s;pecial reference to Indian more than to other trade: on the contrary, they are ex|pre&s;sly to be imported for "the purpo&s;es of commerce" at large; &s;o that in the ca&s;es in which they are priviledged, they are equally &s;o, whether it be for a trade with our citizens, or with Indians.
<PB N="59" REF="028795_0059_0FDD4A30F3E30908">
The di&s;tinction therefore, only proves the embarra&s;&s;ment of its in|ventor, without &s;olving the difficulty. A curious a&s;&s;ertion has been made on this article of duties. It has been &s;aid, that while we are obliged to admit Briti&s;h goods on the &s;ame duties with tho&s;e paid by our own citizens, on importation in our own ve&s;&s;els, G. Britain, under the right to lay <HI>countervailing</HI> duties may incumber us with an additional <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">opr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct. Can any thing be more ab&s;urd than the po&s;i|tion, that the right to lay countervailing duties exi&s;ts in a ca&s;e where there is no difference of duty to <HI>countervail?</HI> The term is manife&s;t|ly a relative one, and can only operate where there is &s;omething on our &s;ide to be countervailed or counterbalanced, and in an exact ratio to it. If it be true that a very high law character is the writer of Cato, we cannot but be &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;uch extreme inaccuracy.</P>
<P>Other errors no le&s;s con&s;iderable will appear in the progre&s;s of the examination, but it will facilitate the detection of the&s;e and tend to a more thorough under&s;tanding of the article, to &s;tate in this place &s;ome general facts, which are material in a compari&s;on of the advantages and di&s;advantages of the article, to the re&s;pective parties.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The fur trade within our limits is to the fur trade within the Briti&s;h limits, as one to &s;even nearly: that is, the trade with the Indians, on the Briti&s;h &s;ide of the boundary line, is about &s;even times greater than the &s;ame trade on our &s;ide of that line. This fact is &s;tated at the re&s;ult of repeated enquiry from well informed per|&s;ons for &s;everal years pa&s;t. It will not appear extraordinary to tho&s;e who recollect how much the indians on our &s;ide are circum|&s;cribed in their hunting grounds, and to what a degree they are re|duced in numbers by the frequent wars, in which they have been engaged with us: while the tribes on the Briti&s;h &s;ide of the line are not only far more numerous, but enjoy an immen&s;e undi&s;turbed range of wilderne&s;s. The more rapid progre&s;s of &s;ettlement on our &s;ide than on the other, will fa&s;t increa&s;e the exi&s;ting di&s;parity.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Our communication with the &s;ea is more ea&s;y, &s;afe, and ex|peditious, than that of Canada, by the St. Laurance. Accordingly, while our ve&s;&s;els ordinarily make two voyages in a year, to and from Europe, the Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els in the Canada trade are, from the cour&s;e of the &s;ea&s;ons, and the nature of the navigation, confined to one voyage in a year. Though hitherto, from temporary circum|&s;tances, this difference has not made any &s;en&s;ible difference in the price of tran&s;portation, yet in its permanent operation, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould not give us a material advantage in the competi|tion for the &s;upply of European goods to a large part of Canada, e&s;pecially that which is denominated Upper Canada. The city of Hud&s;on, di&s;tant 124 miles from the city of New-York, is as near to the junction of the river Cataraquay and Lake Ontario as Montreal, which la&s;t is near four hundred miles di&s;tant from the mouth of the St. Lawrance. When the canals, now in rapid execution, are com|pleted, there will be water communication the whole way from the city of Hud&s;on to Ontario.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The &s;upply of Ea&s;t-India goods to Canada is likely to be al|ways ea&s;ier and cheaper through us, than in any other way. Accord|ing to the pre&s;ent Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tem, Canada is &s;uppplied through Britain. It is obvious how much the charges of this double voyage mu&s;t en|hance
<PB N="60" REF="028795_0060_0FDD49FE90120F38">
the prices of the articles when delivered in Canada. A direct trade between the Ea&s;t-Indies and Canada, would &s;uppo&s;e a change in the Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tem, to which there are great ob&s;tacles; and even then, there are circum&s;tances which would &s;ecure to us an ad|vantageous competition. It is a fact which &s;erves to illu&s;trate our advantages that Ea&s;t-India articles, including teas, are upon an average, cheaper in the United States than in England.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts demon&s;trate that a trade between us and the Briti&s;h territories in our neighbourhood, upon equal terms as to privilege, mu&s;t afford a balance of advantages on our &s;ide. As to the fur trade, for a participation in one eighth of the whole which we can cede, we gain a participation in 7-8hs which is conceded to us. As to the European and Ea&s;t-India trade, we acquire the right of com|petition upon equal terms of privilege with real and con&s;iderable advantages of &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The &s;tipulation with regard to equal duties was e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of our &s;uperi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rity of advantages in this trade, while it could not interfere with the general policy of our regulation con|cerning the difference of duties on goods imported in our own and in foreign bottoms; becau&s;e the &s;upplies which can come to us through Canada, for the rea&s;ons already given mu&s;t be incon&s;iderable &mdash;becau&s;e, al&s;o, di&s;tance would &s;oon countervail, in expences of tran&s;portation, the effect of the difference of duties in our market &mdash;and becau&s;e, in the la&s;t place, this difference is not very &s;en&s;ible, owing to the large proportion of goods which are imported in the names of our own citizens. I &s;ay nothing here of the impractica|bility on general grounds of long maintaining with effect this regu|lation.</P>
<P>Is it not wonderful, con&s;idering the real &s;tate of the trade as de|pending on locality, that the treaty &s;hould be charged with &s;acrific|ing the fur trade to the Briti&s;h? If there be any &s;acrifice, is it not on their &s;ide? when the fact is, that the quantity of trade in which they admit us to equal privileges is &s;even times greater than that in which we admit them to equal privileges.</P>
<P>The arguments again&s;t the treaty on this point, are not only full of fallacy, but they are in contradiction with each other</P>
<P>On the one hand, it is argued that our communication from the &s;ea, with the Indian country, being much ea&s;ier than by the St. Lawrence, we could furni&s;h Engli&s;h goods cheaper, and of cour&s;e, could have continued the Indian trade in its u&s;ual channel, even from the Briti&s;h &s;ide of the lakes, nor could they have prevented it without giving &s;uch di&s;gu&s;t to the Indians as would have made them dangerous neighbours. On the other hand, it is argued, that from &s;uperiority of capital, better knowledge of the trade, a better e&s;ta|bli&s;hed connection of cu&s;tomers, the Briti&s;h will be able to &s;upplant us, even in our own territories, and to acquire a monopoly of the whole fur trade.</P>
<P>Propo&s;itions &s;o oppo&s;ite cannot all be true. Either the &s;uppo&s;ed faculty of &s;upplying Engli&s;h goods cheaper, which it is &s;aid, would give us a command of the Indian trade, even on the Briti&s;h &s;ide of the lakes, not in the power of the Briti&s;h to prevent, overbalances the advantages which are &s;pecified on the other &s;ide, or it does not &mdash;If it does not, then is it not true that it could draw to us the
<PB N="61" REF="028795_0061_0FDD4A328188BEF8">
trade from the Briti&s;h &s;ide of the lakes&mdash;If it does, then is it not true that the Briti&s;h can &s;upplant us in the trade on either &s;ide of the lakes; much le&s;s that they can obtain a monopoly of it on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if it be true that the Briti&s;h could not prevent our trading with the Indians on their &s;ide, without giving them &s;uch di&s;gu&s;t as to make them dangerous neighbours, why is it not equally true that we could not prevent their trading with the Indians on our &s;ide, without producing a &s;imilar effect? And if they have really a &s;upe|riority of advantages, why would they not, on the principle of this argument, attract and divert the trade from us, though a mutual right to trade with the Indians in each others territories had not been &s;tipulated?</P>
<P>The difficulty of re&s;training the Indians from trading at plea&s;ure, is an idea well founded, as has been admitted in another place. But there re&s;ults from it, &s;trong arguments in favour of a recipro|cation of privileges in the Indian trade by treaty. One of them, its tendency to pre&s;erve peace and good under&s;tanding, has been already noticed: another ari&s;es from the con&s;ideration that it will probably be the policy of the Briti&s;h to maintain larger military e&s;tabli&s;hments on their frontier, than we &s;hall think eligible on ours, which will render it proportionably more ea&s;y to them to re&s;train their Indians, than it will be to us to re&s;train ours. This greater difficulty of executing re&s;traints on our &s;ide, is a powerful rea&s;on for us to agree, mutually to throw open the door.</P>
<P>It will not be &s;urprizing, if upon &s;ome other occa&s;ion the adver|&s;aries of the treaty &s;hould abandon their own ground, and in&s;tead of &s;aying the treaty is faulty, for what it &s;tipulates on this point &s;hould affirm merely that it has no merit on this account, &s;ince it only does what the di&s;po&s;itions of the Indians would have brought about without it.&mdash;But it is always a merit to dive&s;t an advantageous thing of cau&s;e of di&s;pute, and to fix by amicable agreement, a be|nefit which otherwi&s;e would be liable to litigation, oppo&s;ition and interruption.</P>
<P>As to relative advantages for carrying on the trade, the compari|&s;on ought to be made with caution. That which has been &s;tated on our &s;ide, namely, greater facility in conveying the materials of the trade from Europe, to the &s;eene where it is to be carried on is a real one, and in proce&s;s of time may be expected to make it&s;elf to be felt; yet hitherto, as before ob&s;erved, it has had no &s;en&s;ible effect.</P>
<P>Of the advantages which have been &s;tated as belonging to the other &s;ide, there is but one which has &s;ub&s;tance, and this is previous po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ground. But even this from the very nature of it is temporary&mdash;With our u&s;ual ente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">prize and indu&s;try it would be a&s;toni&s;hing if we do not &s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;hare the ground to the full ex|tent of our relative advantag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>As to &s;upe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iority of capital, it amounts to nothing. It has been &s;een that the capital requ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ite for the whole trade is &s;mall.&mdash;From a hundred to a hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling would be a high &s;tatement. The whole of this, if we were to monopolize the entire trade, could not create a moment's embarra&s;&s;ment to find it, in the opinion of any man who attends to the great pecuniary
<PB N="62" REF="028795_0062_0FDD4A004E0635C0">
operations which are daily going on in our country. But that very capital which is repre&s;ented as our rival, could be brought into action for our benefit in this very trade. The &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ution is &s;imple: Our credit will command it in obtaining the foreign articles nece&s;&s;a|ry for the trade upon as good terms as the merchants who now carry it on. The &s;ame objection of &s;uperiority of capital may with as much rea&s;on be applied to any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther branch of trade between us and Great Britain. Why does it not give her a monopoly of the direct trade between her European dominions and the United States? The argument, if valid, would prove that we ought to have no commerce, not only with Great Britain, but with any nation which has more capital than our&s;elves.</P>
<P>As to &s;uperior knowledge of the particular branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, there is &s;till le&s;s force in that argument. It is not a ca&s;e of ab&s;tru&s;e &s;cience or complicated combination. And we are in no want of per&s;ons among us who are experimentally acquainted with the &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>As to cu&s;tomers for the proceeds of the trade, we &s;hould &s;tand upon as good a footing as the Briti&s;h merchants. What we did not want for our own con&s;umption might be &s;ent upon equal terms to the very market to which they &s;end theirs; and to others which might be found preferable, becau&s;e le&s;s well &s;upplied with the kind of articles.</P>
<P>As to whatever may depend on enterprize, we need not fear to be outdone by any people on earth. It may almo&s;t be &s;aid that enterprize is our element.</P>
<P>It has been alledged that our trade with the Indians would be in|turrupted by bad &s;ea&s;ons and occa&s;ional war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le that of Great Britain would be &s;teady and uniform.

<P>But the intrigues of the Briti&s;h traders re&s;iding among our Indi|ans would excite them to ho&s;tility. It could not be the private inte|re&s;t of the traders to do this, becau&s;e be&s;ides being amenable to puni&s;hment if di&s;covered, be&s;ides, that both the trader and the In|dians within our limits, by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the po&s;ts would be under our con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roul, wars interrupt of cour&s;e the hunting of the Indians, and &s;o de&s;troy their means of trading.</P>
<P>As to great Britain, &s;he never could have had but one intere&s;t to prompt Indian hi&s;tilities, that was to induce the United States to relinqui&s;h a part of their boundary. The re&s;titution of the po&s;ts will put an end to this project. In regard to trade, &s;he and her traders will have a common intere&s;t with us and our traders to keep all the Indians at peace for the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned above. This intere&s;t will be the &s;tronger, becau&s;e the be&s;t communication even with her own Indians will be partly through our territory, and it would be impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould not be impeded and interrupted by the operations of war between us and the Indians. In fact under the circum&s;tance of common privileges, there is every po&s;&s;ible link

The &s;ecurity for our peace appears to be much greater in the latter than in the former &s;tate of things.</P>
<P>A &s;u&s;picion is al&s;o &s;ugge&s;ted, that Great Britain, without exciting war, would indirectly tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and ob&s;truct our trade. To objections which &s;uppo&s;e a want of fair dealing in the other party, it is very difficult to an&s;wer.

If Great Britain acts with infide|lity or chicamery towards us, we mu&s;t retract the privileges granted on our &s;ide,</P>
<P>Another objection which is made is, that while the Briti&s;h would have a right to re&s;ide am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, to hire hou&s;es and warehouses, and to enjoy every convenience for pro&s;ecuting the trade &s;y&s;tematical|ly, we &s;hould not be entitled to &s;imilar p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iveleges w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h them hav|ing only a right to pa&s;s "like pedlars with our &s;hops upon our backs."

<P>The po&s;ition is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ounded on that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the Briti&s;h act of navi|gation, which forbids any but a neutralized &s;ubject to exerci&s;e the occupation of a merchant or factor in any of the Briti&s;h dominions in A&s;ia, Africa and America.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is to be ob&s;erved, that as far as the article under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion is &s;ingly concerned, there is no pretence to &s;ay that one party has greater rights as to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;idence than the other. If therefore Great B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itain can prevent our citizens re&s;iding in their territories, we are free by this article to apply to them a &s;imi|lar exclu&s;ion. And any right of re&s;idence which may be claimed under any other part of the treaty will be temporary.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place the prohibition act in the navigation pro|ceeds on the ground of exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uding foreigners from carry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng on trade in the territories to which it extends. But the third article ex|pre&s;sly gives us a right freely to carry on trade and commerce with the Briti&s;h territories on this continent, a right which nece&s;&s;arily includes the privilege of re&s;iding as merchants and factors. For wherever an END is granted, the <HI>u&s;ual</HI> and <HI>proper means</HI> to enjoy it are implied in the grant.

<P><PB N="64" REF="028795_0064_0FDD4A01BAE1C2D0">This rea&s;oning has peculiar force in relation to inland trade.

<P>THE remaining allegations in di&s;paragement of the third article, are to this effect: 1. That the exception of the country of the Hud&s;on's Bay company, owing to its undefined limits, renders the &s;tipulations in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avour in a great mea&s;ure nugatory. 2. That the privileges granted to Great-Britain in our Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi ports are imp|olitic, becau&s;e without reciprocity. 3. That the agreement to for|bear to lay duties of entry on p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tries, is the &s;urrender, without equivalent, of a valuable item of revenue, and will give to the Bri|ti&s;h the facility of carrying on their fur trade through us with the u&s;e of our advantages. 4. That the articles which will be brought from Europe into Canada, coming duty free, can be afforded cheap|er than the &s;ame articles going th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther from us charged with a heavy duty on their importation into the United States, and with the ex|pence of a long tran&s;portation by land and inland navigation. 5. That the population of Canada, which, by a cen&s;us in 1784, amount|ed only to 123082 &s;ouls, is too &s;mall to render the &s;upply of Euro|pean and A&s;iatic commodities through us of &s;o much importance as to bear any compari&s;on with the lo&s;s by the &s;acrifice of the fur trade. 6 That the intercou&s;e to be permitted with the Briti&s;h ter|ritories will facilitate &s;muggling, to the injury of our revenue. 7. That the much greater extent of the United States than of the Briti&s;h territories de&s;troys real reciprocity in the privileges granted by the article, giving in fact far greater advantages than are received. The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions will be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the order in which they are here &s;tated.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is true that the country of the Hud&s;on's Bay Company is not well defined.&mdash;Their charter, granted in 1670, gives them "the &s;ole trade and commerce of and to all the &s;eas, bays, &s;treights, creeks,
<PB N="65" REF="028795_0065_0FDD4A37FB4A9AA8">
lakes, rivers, and &s;ounds, in what&s;oever latitude they &s;hall be, that lie within the entrance of the &s;treight, commonly called Hud&s;on's Streights, together with all the lands countries, and territories upon the coa&s;ts and confines of the &s;aid &s;eas, &s;treights, bays, &amp;c. which are now actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any of our &s;ubjects, or by the &s;ubjects of any other Chri&s;tian prince or &s;tate."</P>
<P>To a&s;certain their territorial limits, according to charter, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to know what portion of country, at the time of the grant, was actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, or of &s;ome other Chri&s;tian prince or &s;tate: but though this be not known, the general hi&s;tory of the country, as to &s;ettlement, will demon&s;trate that it could not have extended far we&s;tward, certainly not to that region which is the &s;cene of trade in furs, commonly called the North We&s;t Trade, carried on by the Canada company from Cana|da; the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which, as far as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion exi&s;ts, is recent.&mdash; We learn from a traveller who has lately vi&s;ited that region, that one of this company's e&s;tabli&s;hments is in lat. 56.9. N. long. 117.43. W. that is, about twenty degrees of longitude we&s;tward of the Lake of the Woods; and it is generally under&s;tood, that the en|tire &s;cene of the trade of this company is we&s;tward of the limits of the Hud&s;on's Bay Company.</P>
<P>Canada, on the north, is bounded by the territories of the Hud|&s;on's Bay Company. This is admitted by the treaty of Utrecht, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the act of parliament in 1774, commonly called the Quebec act. The treaty of Utrecht provides for the &s;ettlement of the boundary by commi&s;&s;aries. I have not been able to trace whether the line was ever actually &s;o &s;ettled, but &s;everal maps lay down a line as the one &s;ettled by the treaty of Utrecht, which runs north of the Lake of the Woods.</P>
<P>In a ca&s;e thus &s;ituated, the United States will ju&s;tly claim, un|der the article, acce&s;s to all that country, the trade of which is now carried on through Canada. This will re&s;ult both from the certainty that there were no actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, at the date of the charter, &s;o far interior, and from the fact of the trade being carried on through a different channel, by a different company, under the &s;uperinten|dance and protection of a different government, that of Canada. It may be a&s;ked, why was the article embarra&s;&s;ed by the exception of the country of the Hud&s;on's Bay Company? The an&s;wer is this, That the charter of this company gives it a monopoly within its limits, and therefore, a right to trade there could not have been granted with propriety, to a foreign power by treaty. It is true that it has been que&s;tioned, whether this monopoly was valid again&s;t Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, &s;eeing that the charter had not been confirmed by act of parliament. But be&s;ides that this doubt has been confined to Briti&s;h &s;ubiects, it would appear that in fact, the company has en|joyed the monopoly granted by its charter, even again&s;t them, and with at lea&s;t the implied approbation of parliament. In the year 1749, petitions were preferred in the Hou&s;e of Commons, by dif|ferent trading towns in England, for re&s;cinding the monopoly and opening the trade. An enquiry was in&s;tituted by the hou&s;e. The report of its committee was favourable to the conduct and preten|&s;ions of the company, and again&s;t the expediency of opening the trade; and the bu&s;ine&s;s terminated there.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="028795_0066_0FDD4A034464C180">This circum&s;tance of there being a monopoly, confirms the argument drawn from the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct, that the north we&s;t trade is carried on through Canada by the Canada Company: which affords a deci|&s;ive pre&s;umption, that the trade is not within the country of the Hud&s;on's Bay Company, and is, con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quently, within the operati|on of the privilege granted to us.</P>
<P>Though it will be partly a digre&s;&s;ion, I cannot forbear, in this place, to notice, &s;ome ob&s;ervations of Cato in his 10th number.&mdash; After &s;tating, that in 1784 the peltry from Canada &s;old in London for 230,000l. &s;terling, he proceeds to ob&s;erve, that, excluding the territories of the Hud&s;on's Bay Company, 9 tenths of this trade is within the limits of the United States; and though with &s;tudied am|biguity of expre&s;&s;ion, he end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">avours to have it under&s;tood, that nine-tenths of the trade which yielded the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ltry, that &s;old for 230,000l. &s;terling in 1784, was within our territories. It is natural to a&s;k how he has a&s;certained the limits of the Hud&s;on's Bay Company (which, at other times, is a&s;&s;erted by way of objection to the article, to be altogether indefi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ite) with &s;o much ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctne&s;s as to be able to pro|nounce what proportion, if any, of the trade carried on through Ca|nada, may have come from that country, towards the calculati|on which has led to the conclu&s;ion that nine-tenths of the whole lie within our limits? The truth is, indub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tably and notoriou&s;ly, that whether any or whatever part of the peltry exported from Ca|nada may come from the country of the Hud&s;on's Bay Company, &s;even eighths <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some &s;tatements rate it at between 6-8ths and 7-8ths.</NOTE> of the whole trade which furni&s;hes that peltry, has its &s;ource on the Briti&s;h &s;ide of the boundary line. It follows, that if it were even true, that only one tenth of the whole lay in that part of the Briti&s;h territory, which is not of the Hud&s;on's Bay Company, ina&s;much as only one &s;eventh of it lies within our limits, the re&s;ult would be, that the trade in which we granted an equal privilege was to that in which a like privilege was granted to us, as one &s;eventh to one tenth, and not, according to Cato, as nine to one. This Legerdemain, in argument and calculation, is too frivolous for &s;o &s;erious a &s;ubject: or, to &s;peak more properly, it is too &s;hocking, by the &s;pirit of deception which it betrays.</P>
<P>Cato has a further ob&s;ervation with regard to the trade with the Indians in the vicinity of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and, from that river into the Spani&s;h territories&mdash;The product of all this trade, he &s;ays, mu&s;t go down the M&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and, but for the &s;tipulation of the 3d article, would have been exclu&s;ively ours; becau&s;e, "by the treaty of Paris, though the Briti&s;h might navigate the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, yet they did not own a foot of land upon either of its banks; whereas the United States, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the Indian country in the vicinitity of that river and the ea&s;t bank for many hundred miles, could when t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y plea&s;ed e&s;tabli&s;h factories and monopolize that commerce." This a&s;&s;ertion, with regard to the treaty of Paris, is in every &s;en&s;e of the word in|correct; for the &s;eventh article of that treaty e&s;tabli&s;hes as a boun|dary between the dominions of France and his Britannic maje&s;ty "a line drawn along the middle of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, from its &s;ource to the river Iberville, and from thence by a line drawn along the middle of this river and the lakes Maurepas and Pont Chartraim to

the &s;ea," and cedes to his Britannic maje&s;ty all the country on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi.

<P>Whether a part of this territory does not &s;till belong to him, is a point not yet &s;ettled. The treaty of peace between the United States and Great Britain &s;uppo&s;es that part will remain to Great Britain; for one line of boundary between us and her, de&s;ignated by that treaty, is a line due we&s;t from the lake of the woods to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi. If in fact this river runs far enough north to be inter|&s;ected by &s;uch a line, according to the &s;uppo&s;ition of the la&s;t men|tioned treaty, &s;o much of that river, and the land upon it, as &s;hall be north of the line of inter&s;ection, will continue to be of the do|minion of Great Britain. The treaty lately made, not abandoning the po&s;&s;ibility of this being the ca&s;e, provides for a &s;urvey to a&s;cer|tain the fact: and in every event, the intent of the treaty of peace will require that &s;ome clo&s;ing line, more or le&s;s direct, &s;hall be drawn from the lake of the Woods to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. The Po&s;ition, therefore, that Great-Britain has no land or ports on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, takes for granted what is not a&s;certained, and of which the contrary is pre&s;umed by the treaty of peace.</P>
<P>The trade with the Indian country on our &s;ide of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;|&s;ippi, from the Ohio to the lake of the Woods (if that river extends &s;o far north) &s;ome fragments excepted, has its pre&s;ent direction through Detroit and Michillimacnac, and is incl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded in my calculati|on, heretofore &s;tated, of the proportion which the Indian trade within our limits bears to that within the Briti&s;h limits. Its e&s;ti|mated amount is even under&s;tood to embrace the proceeds of a clande&s;tine traffic with the Spani&s;h territories; &s;o that the new &s;cene &s;uddenly explored by Cato is old and trodden ground, the &s;pecial reference to which cannot vary the re&s;ults that have been pre&s;ented. It is &s;till unque&s;tionably true, that the fur trade within our limits bears no proportion to that within the Briti&s;h limits. As to a con|tigent traffic with the territories of Spain, each patry will pur&s;ue it according to right and opportunity; each would have independent of the treat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the facility of bordering territories.</P>
<P>The geography of the be&s;t regions of the fur trade, in the Spani&s;h territories, is too little known to be much rea&s;oned upon; and if the Spaniards, according to their u&s;ual policy, incline to exclude their neighbours, their precautions along the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi will render the acce&s;s to it circuitous; a circum&s;tance which makes it problematical, whether the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the oppo&s;ite bank is, as to that object, an advantage or not; and whether we may not find it convenient to be able, under the treaty, to take a circuit through the Briti&s;h territo|ries.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is upon the &s;ugge&s;tion of Great-Britain having no ports on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, that the charge of want of reciprocity in the privileges granted, with regard to the u&s;e of that river is founded. The &s;ugge&s;ti|on has been &s;hewn to be more peremptory than is ju&s;tified by facts. Yet it is &s;till true, that the ports on our &s;ide bear no proportion to any that can exi&s;t on the part of the Briti&s;h according to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of territory. It will be examined in a &s;ub&s;equent place, how
<PB N="68" REF="028795_0068_0FDD4A08361CE3D8">
far this di&s;proportion is a proper rule in the e&s;timate of reciprocity. But let it be ob&s;erved in the mean time, that in judging of the re|ciprocity of an article it is to be taken collectively. If upon the whole, the privileges obtained are as valuable as tho&s;e granted, there is a &s;ub&s;tantial reciprocity; and to this te&s;t, upon full and fair examination of the article, I freely refer the deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if the &s;ituation of Great Britain did not permit in this par|ticular, a preci&s;e equivalent, it will not follow that the grant on our part was improper, unle&s;s it can be &s;hewn, that it was attended with &s;ome inconvenience, injury or lo&s;s to us; a thing which has not been, and I believe cannot be &s;hewn. Perhaps there is a very importantly beneficial &s;ide to this que&s;tion. The treaty of peace e&s;tabli&s;hed be|tween us and Great Britain a common intere&s;t in the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, the pre&s;ent treaty &s;trengthens that common intere&s;t. Every body knows that the u&s;e of the river is denied to us by Spain, and that it is an indi&s;pen&s;ible outlet to our we&s;tern country. Is it an inconve|nient thing to us, that the intere&s;t of Great Britain has in this par|ticular been more completely &s;eparated from that of Spain, and more clo&s;ely connected with ours?</P>
<P>The agreement to forbear to lay duties of entry on peltries, is completely defen&s;ible on the following grounds, viz. It has been the general policy of commercial nations, to exempt raw materials from duty. This has likewi&s;e been the uniform policy of the United States, and it has particularly embraced the article of peltries, which by our exi&s;ting laws may be imported into any part of the United States <HI>free from duty.</HI> The object of this regulation is the encouragement of manufactures, by facilitating a cheap &s;upply of raw materials. A duty of entry therefore, as to &s;uch part of the article as might be worked up at home, would be prejudicial to our manufacturing intere&s;t, as to &s;uch part as might be exported, if the duty was not drawn back, would injure our commercial intere&s;t. But it is the general policy of our laws, in conformity with the practice of other commercial countries, to draw back and return the duties which are charged upon the importation of foreign commo|dities. This has reference to the advancement of the export trade of the country; &s;o that with regard to &s;uch peltries as &s;hould be re|exported, there would be no advantage to our revenue from having laid a duty of entry.</P>
<P>Such a duty then being contrary to our e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem and to true principles, there can be no objection to a &s;tipulation again&s;t it. As to its having the effect of making our country the channel of the Briti&s;h trade in peltries, this if true, and it is indeed probable, could not but promote our intere&s;t. A large proportion of the profits would then nece&s;&s;arily remain with us to compen&s;ate for tran&s;port|ation and agencies. It is likely too that to &s;ecure the fidelity of agents, as is u&s;ual, co-partner&s;hips would be formed, of which Bri|ti&s;h capital would be the principal in&s;trument, and which would throw a &s;till greater proportion of the profits into our hands. The more we can make our country the <HI>Entrepot,</HI> the <HI>Emporium</HI> of the trade of foreigners, the more we &s;hall profit. There is no commer|cial principle more obvious than this, more univer&s;ally agreed, or more generally practi&s;ed upon, in countries where commerce is well under&s;tood.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="69" REF="028795_0069_0FDD4A3AC31DA350">4. The fourth of the above enumerated &s;ugge&s;tions is an&s;wered in its principal point by the practice ju&s;t &s;tated, of drawing back the duties on importation when articles are re-exported. This would place the articles, which we &s;hould &s;end into the Briti&s;h terri|tories, exactly upon the &s;ame footing as to duties with the &s;ame articles imported there from Europe. With regard to the addition|al expence of tran&s;portation, this is another in&s;tance of the contra|diction of an argument, which has been relied upon by both &s;ides, that taking the voyage from Europe in conjunction with the interior tran&s;portation the advantage, upon the whole, is likely to be in our favour. And it is upon this aggregate tran&s;portation that the calcu|lation ought to be made. With re&s;pect to India or A&s;iatic articles, there is the circum&s;tance of a double voyage.</P>
<P N="5">5. As to the &s;mall population of Canada, which is urged to de|preciate the advantages of the trade with the white inhabitants of tho&s;e countries, it is to be ob&s;erved, that this population is not &s;tati|onary. If the date of the cen&s;us be rightly quoted, it was taken eleven years ago, when there were already 123,082 &s;ouls. It is pre&s;umeable that this number will &s;oon be doubled; for it is noto|rious, that &s;ettlement has proceeded for &s;ome years with con&s;iderable rapidity in Upper Canada, and there is rea&s;on to believe that the future progre&s;s will not be &s;low. In time to come the trade may grow into real magn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tude, but be it more or le&s;s beneficial, it is &s;o much gained by the articles, and &s;o much clear gain, &s;ince it has been &s;hewn not to be true that it is counterbalanced by a &s;acrifice in the fur trade.</P>
<P N="6">6. With regard to the &s;uppo&s;ed danger of &s;muggling in the inter|cour&s;e permitted by this article, it is very probable it will be found le&s;s than if it were prohibited. Intirely to prevent trade between bordering territories, is a very arduous, perhaps an impracticable ta&s;k. If not authori&s;ed, &s;o much as is carried on mu&s;t be illicit, and it may be pre&s;umed, that the extent of illicit trade will be much greater in that ca&s;e, than where an intercour&s;e is permitted under the u&s;ual regulations and guards. In the la&s;t ca&s;e, the inducement to it is le&s;s, and &s;uch as will only influence per&s;ons of little character or prin-ciple while every fair trader is from private intere&s;t a cen|tinel to the laws; in the other ca&s;e, all are intere&s;ted to break through the barriers of a rigorous and apparently unkind prohibiti|on. This con&s;ideration has probably had its weight with our go|vernment in opening a communication through Lake Champlain with Canada; of the principle of which regulation the treaty is only an exten&s;ion.</P>
<P N="7">7. The pretended inequality of the article, as ari&s;ing from the greater extent of the United States than of the Briti&s;h territories, is one of tho&s;e fanciful po&s;itions which are &s;o apt to haunt the brains of vi&s;ionary politicians. Traced through all its con&s;equences, it would terminate in this, that a great empire could never form a treaty of commerce with a &s;mall one, for to equalize advantages according to the &s;cale of territory, the &s;mall &s;tate mu&s;t compen&s;ate for its deficiency in extent by a greater <HI>quantum</HI> of po&s;itive privilege in proportion to the difference of extent which would give the larger &s;tate the monopoly of its trade. According to this principle what wretched treaties have we made with France, Sweden, Pru&s;&s;ia, and
<PB N="70" REF="028795_0070_0FDD4A09364D0428">
Holland? for our territories exceed in extent tho&s;e of either of the&s;e powers. How immen&s;e the &s;acrifice in the ca&s;e of Holland; for the United States are one hundred times larger than the United Pro|vinces.</P>
<P>But how are we &s;ure, that the extent of the United States is greater than the territories of Great Britain on our continent? We know that &s;he has preten&s;ions to extend to the pacific ocean and to embrace a va&s;t wilderne&s;s, incomparably larger than the United States, and we are told as already mentioned, that her trading e&s;ta|bli&s;hments now actually extend beyond the 56th degree of north latitude, and 117th degree of we&s;t longitude.</P>
<P>Shall we be told (&s;hifting the original ground) that not extent of territory, but extent of population i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mea&s;ure? Then how great is the advantage which we gain in this particular, by the treaty at large? The population of Great Britain is to that of the United States, about two and a half to one; and the comparative conce&s;&s;i|on by her in the trade between her European dominions and the Unit|ed States, mu&s;t be in the &s;ame ratio. When we add to this the great population of her Ea&s;t India po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, in which privi-leges are granted to us, without any return how prodigiou&s;ly will the value of the treaty grow upon us according to this new and extraordinary rule?</P>
<P>But the rule is in fact, an ab&s;urd one, and only merits the notice which has been taken of it, to exhibit the weak grounds of oppo&s;iti|on to the treaty. The great &s;tandard of reciprocity is equal privi|lege. The adventitous circum&s;tances which may render it more be|neficial to one party than the other, can &s;eldom be taken into the account, becau&s;e they can &s;eldom be e&s;timated with certainty&mdash;the relative extent of country or population, is of all others, a fallacious guide.</P>
<P>The comparative re&s;ources and facilities for mutual &s;upply, re|gulate the relative utility of a commercial privilege; and as far as population is concerned, it may be laid down as a general rule, that the &s;malle&s;t population graduates the &s;cale of the trade on both &s;ides, &s;ince it is at once the principal mea&s;ure of what the &s;maller &s;tate can furni&s;h to the greater, and of what the former can take from the latter, or in other words, of what the greater &s;tate can find a demand for from the &s;maller &s;tate. But this rule too, like mo&s;t general ones, admits of numerous exceptions.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of a trade by land and inland navigation, the &s;phere of the operation of any privilege can only extend a certain di&s;tance. When the di&s;tance to a given point, through a particular channel, is &s;uch that the expence of tran&s;portation would render an article dearer than it could be brought through another channel to the &s;ame point, the privilege to carry the article through that particular channel to &s;uch point, becomes of no avail. Thus the privilege of trading by land or inland navigation, from the Briti&s;h territories on this continent, can procure to that country no advantage of trade with Princeton, in New-Jer&s;ey, becau&s;e &s;upplies can come to it on better terms from other quarters. Whence we perceive, that the ab&s;olute extent of territory or population of the United States, is no mea&s;ure of the relative value of the privileges reciprocally grant|ed
<PB N="71" REF="028795_0071_0FDD4A3C56FB58B8">
by the article under con&s;ideration, and con&s;equently no criteri|on of the real reciprocity of the article.</P>
<P>The objectors to the treaty have mar&s;halled again&s;t this article a quaint figure, of which from the u&s;e of it, in different quarters, it is pre&s;umable they are not a little enamoured; it is this, that the article enables Great-Britain to draw a <HI>line of circumvallation</HI> round the United States. They hope to excite prejudice, by pre&s;enting to the mind, the image of a &s;iege or inve&s;tment of the country. If trade be war, they have cho&s;en a mo&s;t apt figure; and we cannot but wonder, how the unfortunate i&s;land of Great Britain, has been able &s;o long to maintain her independence amid&s;t the beleaguering efforts of the number of nations with whom &s;he has been impru|dent enough to form treaties of commerce; and who, from her in&s;ulated &s;ituation, have it in their power to be&s;et and hem her in on all &s;ides. How lucky it is for the United States, that at lea&s;t one &s;ide is covered by Spain, and that this formidable line of circumvallati|on cannot be completely perfected! or rather how! and driven mu&s;t tho&s;e be, who are obliged to call to their aid, auxiliaries &s;o prepo&s;|terous!</P>
<P>Can any good rea&s;on be given, why one &s;ide of a country &s;hould not be acce&s;&s;ible to foreigners for purpo&s;es of trade equally with ano|ther? Might not the cultivators on the &s;ide from which they were excluded, have cau&s;e to complain, that the carriage of their produc|tions was &s;ubject to an increa&s;ed charge, by a monopoly of the nati|onal navigation; while the cultivators in other quarters enjoyed the benefit of a competition between that and foreign navigation? and might not all the inhabitants have a right to demand a rea&s;on, why their commerce &s;hould be le&s;s open and free, than that of other parts of the country? Will privileges of trade extend the line of ter|ritorial circum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">allation? Will not the extent of contiguous Briti&s;h territory remain the &s;ame, whether the communications of trade are open or &s;hut? By opening them, may we not rather be &s;aid to make &s;o many breaches in the wall, or intrenchment of this newly invent|ed circumvallation? If indeed it be not inchanted!</P>
<P>The argument upon this article, has hitherto turned, as to the trade with the white inhabitants of the Briti&s;h territories, on Euro|pean and Ea&s;t India goods. But there can be no doubt that a mutu|ally beneficial commerce in native commodities ought to be included in the catalogue of advantages. Already there is a u&s;eful inter|change of certain commodities, which time and the progre&s;s of &s;ettle|ment &amp; re&s;ources cannot fail to extend. It is mo&s;t probable too, that a con&s;iderable part of the productions of the Briti&s;h territories will find the mo&s;t convenient channel to foreign markets thro' us; which as far as it regards the intere&s;ts of external commerce will yield little le&s;s advantage than if they proceeded from our own &s;oil or indu&s;try. It is evident in particular, that as far as this &s;hall be the ca&s;e, it will prevent a great part of the competition with our commodities which would exi&s;t, if tho&s;e productions took other routs to foreign markets.</P>
<P>In con&s;idering the &s;ubject on the &s;ide of a trade in home commo|dities, it is an important reflection, that the United States are much more advanced in indu&s;trious improvement, than the Briti&s;h territories. This will give us a material and a growing advantage. While their articles of exchange with us will e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;t in the
<PB N="72" REF="028795_0072_0FDD4A0AB5A49EC8">
products of agriculture and of mines, we &s;hall add to the&s;e manu|factures of various and multiplying kinds, &s;erving to increa&s;e the balance in our favour.</P>
<P>In proportion as the article is viewed on an enlarged and perma|nent &s;eale, its importance to us magnifies. Who can &s;ay how far Bri|ti&s;h colonization may &s;pread &s;outhward and down the we&s;t &s;ide of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, northward and we&s;tward into the va&s;t interior regi|ons towards the pacific ocean? Can we view it as a matter of indif|fference, that this new world is eventually laid open to our enter|prize, to an enterprize &s;econded by the immen&s;e advantage already mentioned, of a more improved &s;tate of indu&s;try? Can we be in&s;en&s;i|ble, that the precedent furni&s;hes us with a cogent and per&s;ua&s;ive argument, to bring Spain to a &s;imilar arrangement? And can we be bind to the great intere&s;ts we have in obtaining a free communicati|on with all the territories that environ our country from the St. Ma|ry's to the St. Croix.</P>
<P>In this large view of the &s;ubject, the fur trade which has made a very prominent figure in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, becomes a point &s;carcely vi&s;ible. Objects of great variety &amp;magnitude, &s;tart up in per&s;pec|ctive, eclip&s;ing the little atoms of the day, and promi&s;ing to grow and mature with time.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the whole is, that the United States make by the 3d art. of the treaty a good bargain&mdash;that with regard to the fur trade, with equality of privileges and &s;uperior advantages of &s;iuation, we &s;take one again&s;t &s;even, or at mo&s;t one again&s;t &s;ix&mdash;that as to the trade in European and Ea&s;t India Goods and in home productions, we make an equal &s;take, with &s;ome advantages of &s;ituation&mdash;that we open an immen&s;e field of future enterprize&mdash;that we avoid embar|ra&s;&s;ments and dangers ever attendant on an artificial and prohibito|ry policy, which in reference to the Indian nations was particularly difficult and hazardous&mdash;and, that we &s;ecure tho&s;e of a natural and liberal policy, &amp; give the faire&s;t chances for good neighbourhood between the United States and the bordering Briti&s;h territories, and con&s;equently of good under&s;tanding with Great-Britain, conducing to the &s;ecurity of our peace. Experience, no doubt, will demon&s;trate that the horrid &s;pectres which have been conjured up are fictions and if it &s;hould even be &s;low to realize the predicted benefits (for time will be requi&s;ite to give permanent cau&s;es their due effect in con|trouling temporary circum&s;tances) it will at lea&s;t prove, that the pre|dicted evils are chimeras and cheats.</P>

<P>THE fourth and fifth articles of the treaty, from &s;imilarity of ob|ject, will naturally be con&s;idered together. The fourth, recit|ing a doubt "whether the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi extends &s;o far north, as to be inter&s;ected by a line drawn due we&s;t from the lake of the woods, in the manner mentioned in the treaty of peace," agrees that mea&s;ures &s;hall be taken in concert between the two govern|ments
<PB N="73" REF="028795_0073_0FDD4A3DC552D6B8">
to make a joint &s;urvey of that river, from a degree of latitude below the fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls of St. Anthony, to the principal &s;ource or &s;ources thereof, and of the parts adjacent thereto, and that if in the re&s;ult it &s;hould appear that the &s;aid river would not be inter&s;ected by &s;uch a line as above mentioned, the two parties will proceed by amicable negociation, to regulate the boundary line in that quarter as well as all other points to be adju&s;ted between them, according to ju&s;tice and mutual convenience, and the intent of the treaty of peace. The fifth, reciting that doubts have ari&s;en, what river was truly intended under the name of the river St. Croix, mentioned in the treaty of peace, and forming a part of the boundary therein de&s;cribed, pro|vides that the a&s;certainment of the point &s;hall be referred to three commi&s;&s;ioners, to be appointed thus: one to be named by his Bri|tannic Maje&s;ty, another by the Pre&s;ident of the United States, with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, the third by the&s;e two if they can agree in the choice; but if they cannot agree, then each of them to name a per&s;on, and out of the per&s;ons named, one drawn by lot in their pre&s;ence to be the third commi&s;&s;ioner.&mdash;The&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners are to meet at Hallifax, with power to adjourn to any place or plac|es they may think proper&mdash;are to be &s;worn to examine and decide the que&s;tion according to the evidence which &s;hall be la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d before them by both parties&mdash;and are to pronounce their deci&s;ion which is to be conclu&s;ive, by a written declaration under their hands and &s;eals, containing a de&s;cription of the river and particularly the lati|tude and longitude of its mouth and of its &s;ource.</P>
<P>The&s;e articles, though they have been adju&s;ted with critical pro|priety, have not e&s;caped cen&s;ure. They have even in one in&s;tance been &s;everely reprobated, as bringing into que&s;tion, things about which there was no room for any&mdash;and which a bare in&s;pection of the map was &s;ufficient to &s;ettle.</P>
<P>With regard to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, there is no &s;atisfactory evidence that it has ever been explored to its &s;ource. It is even a&s;&s;erted, that it has never been a&s;cended beyond the 45th degree of north latitude, about a degree above the falls of St. Anthony. <HI>Faden's</HI> map in 1793, will &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of the uncertainty which attends this matter. It notes that the river had not been a&s;cended beyond the degree of latitude ju&s;t mentioned and exhibits three &s;treams, one connected with the <HI>Mar&s;hy Lake</HI> in that latitude, another with the <HI>White Bear Lake</HI> near the 46th degree, and the third with the <HI>Red Lake</HI> in the 47th degree; denominating each of the two fir&s;t, "the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi by conjecture," and the la&s;t, "Red Lake River, or La|hontan's Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi,"&mdash;all of them falling con&s;iderably &s;hort in their northern extent of the Lake of the Woods, which is placed as high as the fifteenth degree of north latitude. Thus &s;tands this very clear and certain point which we are told it was di&s;graceful on the part of our envoy to have &s;ufferred to be brought into que&s;tion.</P>
<P>There is however, a &s;pecific topic of blame of the article which has greater plau&s;ibility. It is this, that it does not finally &s;ettle the que&s;tion, but refers the adju&s;tment of the clo&s;ing line to future ne|gociation, in ca&s;e it &s;hould turn out that the river does not &s;tretch far enough north to be inter&s;ected by an ea&s;t and we&s;t line from the Lake of the Woods. I an&s;wer, that the arrangement is preci&s;ely &s;uch as it ought to have been. It would have been premature to
<PB N="74" REF="028795_0074_0FDD4A0C3A65D440">
provide a &s;ub&s;titute till it was a&s;certained that it was nece&s;&s;ary&mdash; This could only be done by an actual &s;urvey&mdash;A &s;urvey is there-fore provided for and will be made at the joint expence of the two coun|tries.</P>
<P>That &s;urvey will not only determine whether a &s;ub&s;titute be re|qui&s;ite or not, but it will furni&s;h data for judging what &s;ub&s;titute is proper, and mo&s;t conformable to the true intent of the treaty.&mdash; Without the data which it will afford, any thing that could have been done, would have been too much a leap in the dark. National acts, e&s;pecially on the important &s;ubject of boundary, ought to be bottomed on a competent knowledge of circum&s;tances. It ought to be clearly under&s;tood how much is retained, how much is relinqui&s;h|ed. Had our envoy proceeded on a different principle, if what he had agreed to had turned out well, it would have been regarded as the lucky re&s;ult of an act of &s;upererogation.&mdash;If it had proved di&s;|advantageous, it would have been &s;tigmatized as an act of improvi|dence and imprudence.</P>
<P>The &s;trong argument for having &s;ettled an alternative is the avoid|ing of future di&s;pute. But what alternative could have been agreed upon, which might not have bred controver&s;y?

How was that point to be identified with adequate certainty? The difficulty of an&s;wering the&s;e que&s;tions will evince, that the danger of controver&s;y might have been encrea&s;ed by an impatience to avoid it, and by anticipating, without the nece&s;&s;ary lights, an adju&s;tment, which they ought to direct.</P>
<P>The facts with regard to the river St. Croix, are the&s;e&mdash;the que&s;ti|on is, which of two rivers is the true St. Croix. The di&s;pute con|cerning it is as old as the French po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Nova Scotia. France &s;et up one river; Great Britain another. The point was undecid|ed when the &s;urrender of Nova Scotia by the former to the latter, put an end to the que&s;tion as between tho&s;e parties&mdash;It was after|wards renewed between the colonies of Nova Scotia and Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts Bay, which la&s;t, in the year 1762, appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to a&s;certain, in conjunction with commi&s;&s;ioners which might be appointed by the Province of Nova Scotia, the true river, but no final &s;ettlement of the matter en&s;ued.</P>
<P>The treaty of peace gives us for one boundary, the river St. Croix, but without defining it. Hence it has happened, that not long after the peace was concluded, the que&s;tion which had before been agi|tated between France and Great Britain, and between the pro|vinces of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Nova Scotia, was revived between the &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and that province, and it has ever &s;ince con|tinued a &s;ubject of debate. A mode of &s;ettling the di&s;pute was un|der the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s in the year 1785, and powers were given to our then mini&s;ter at the court of London, to adju&s;t the affair, but nothing was concluded. And we lear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n from a letter of Mr. Jeffer&s;on to Mr. Hammond, dated the 15th December, 1791, that it then al&s;o engaged the attention of our government: that the a&s;certaining of the point in di&s;pute was deemed a matter of "pre|&s;ent
<PB N="75" REF="028795_0075_0FDD4A3F4B82C318">
urgency," and that it had before been the &s;ubject of applicati|ons from the United States to the government of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that a di&s;pute of &s;uch antiquity, be|tween &s;uch different parties, is not without colourable foundation on either &s;ide; at any rate, it was e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of peace that it &s;hould be adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>If one party could not convince the other by argument of the &s;uperior &s;olidity of its preten&s;ions, I know of no alternative but <HI>Arbitration or War.</HI> Will any one pretend that honour required us in &s;uch a ca&s;e to go to war, or that the object w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of a nature to make it our intere&s;t to refer the deci&s;ion to that &s;olemn, calamitous, and precatious i&s;&s;ue? No rational man will an&s;wer this que&s;tion in the affir|mative. It follows that an arbitration was the proper cour&s;e, and that our envoy acted rightly in acceeding to the expedient. It is one too, not without precedents among nations, though it were to be wi&s;h|ed, for the credit of human moderation, that they were more fre|quent.</P>
<P>Is there any good objection to the mode of the arbitration? It &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible that any one more fair or convenient could have been devi&s;ed, and it is recommended by its analogy to what is com|mon among individuals.</P>
<P>What the mode is, has been already detailed, and need not be repeated here. It is objected that too much has been left to chance, but no &s;ub&s;titute has been offered which would have been attend|ed with le&s;s ca&s;ualty. The fact is, that none &s;uch can be offered. Con&s;cious of this, tho&s;e who make the objection have not thought fit to give an opportunity of compari&s;on by propo&s;ing a &s;ub&s;titute. What is left to chance? Not that there &s;hall be a final deci&s;ion; for this is mo&s;t effectually provided for. It is not only po&s;itively &s;tipu|lated that commi&s;&s;ioners, with full and definitive power, &s;hall be appointed, but an ultimate choice is &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cured, by referring in the la&s;t re&s;ort to a deci&s;ion <HI>by lot,</HI> what it might not be practicable to decide by agreement. This is the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of precaution. Is it that this reference to lot leaves it too uncertain of what character or di&s;|po&s;ition the third commi&s;&s;ioner may be? If this be not rather a re|commendation of the fairne&s;s of the plan, how was it to be remedi|ed? Could it have been expected of either of the parties, to leave the nomination to the other? Certainly not. Would it have been advi&s;able to have referred the ultimate choice to &s;ome other &s;tate or government?&mdash;where would one have been found in the opinion of both parties, &s;ufficiently impartial? On which &s;ide would there have been the greate&s;t danger of a &s;ucce&s;sful employment of undue influence? Is it not evident that this expedient would have added to equal uncertainty, as to character and di&s;po&s;ition, other ca&s;ualties and more delay? Should it have been left to the two commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by the parties to agree at all events? It might have been impo&s;&s;ible for them to come to an agreement, and then the whole plan of &s;ettlement might have been fru&s;trated. Would the &s;word have been a more certain arbiter? Of all uncertain th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngs, the i&s;&s;ues of war are the mo&s;t uncertain. What do objections of this kind prove, but that there are per&s;ons re&s;olved to object at all events?</P>
<P>The &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of this que&s;tion to arbitration has been repre&s;ented as an eventual di&s;memberment of empire, which it has been &s;aid,

<P>Two in&s;tances of the violation of this article have been already no|ticed with a view to another point; one relating to certain laws of the &s;tate of Virginia, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed prior to the peace, which for &s;everal years after it appear to have operated to prevent the legal pur&s;uit of their claims by Briti&s;h creditors. Another relating to a law of the &s;tate of South Carolina, which &s;u&s;pended the recovery of their debts for nine months, and after that period permitted the recovery only in four yearly in&s;talments.</P>
<P>But the&s;e were not all the in&s;tances; there were other laws of South Carolina prolonging the in&s;talments, and obliging the credi|tors to receive in payment the property of debtors at apprai&s;ed va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ues; and there were laws of Rh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de-I&s;land, New-Jer&s;ey, North Carolina and Georgia, making paper money a legal tender for the debts of tho&s;e creditors; which it is known &s;u&s;tained a very great d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">prec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation in every one of tho&s;e &s;tates. The&s;e very &s;erious and compul&s;ory interferences with the rights of the creditors, have re|ceived from Decius, the &s;oft appellation of a modification of the recovery of Briti&s;h debts.&mdash;Does he expect to make us believe by this &s;mooth phra&s;e, that the right to recover the <HI>full value</HI> of a debt in &s;terling money is &s;atisfied by the obligation to take as a &s;ub&s;titute, one half, one third, or one fourth of the real value in paper?</P>
<P>It mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have happened that Briti&s;h creditors have &s;u&s;|tained, from the operation of the different acts alluded to lo&s;&s;es more or le&s;s exten&s;ive, which the more removal of the legal impediments that occa&s;ioned them could not repair: in many in&s;tances the lo&s;&s;es mu&s;t have actually accrued and taken their full effect: in others, where no proceedings may have been had, the lap&s;e of &s;o many years mu&s;t have created inabilities to pay, in debtors who were originally competent, and who might have been made to pay, had there been a free cour&s;e of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The removal of the impediments, therefore, by opening of the courts of ju&s;tice, was not an adequate &s;atisfaction. It could not &s;upercede the obligation of compen&s;ation for lo&s;&s;es which had irre|trievably accrued by the operation of the legal impediments, while they continued in force. The claim for this was &s;till open on the part of Great-Britain, and &s;till to be adju&s;ted between the two na|tions.</P>
<P>The excu&s;e that the&s;e laws were retaliations for prior infractions of treaty by Great Britain, was in no view an an&s;wer to the claim. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>It may not be improper to ob&s;erve, that this excu&s;e implies a palpable violation of the then con&s;titution of the United States.

<P>It might be &s;hewn on a &s;imilar principle, that all confi&s;cations or &s;e|que&s;trations of <HI>Briti&s;h debts,</HI> by particular &s;tates, during the war, were al&s;o uncon&s;titutional.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="028795_0079_0FDD4A4560DDC5C8">In the fir&s;t place, as has been proved, the fact of &s;uch prior in|fractions was too doubtful to be finally in&s;i&s;ted upon, and was, after a fruitle&s;s effort to obtain the acquie&s;cence of the other party, pro|perly and nece&s;&s;arily waved; &s;o that it could not &s;erve as a plea again&s;t reparation.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, if that fact had been indubitable, the &s;pecies of retaliation was unwarrantable.

<P>In the third place, it was e&s;&s;ential to reciprocity in the adju&s;t|ment of the di&s;putes which had exi&s;ted concerning the treaty of peace.

<P>Did our envoy reply that the rein&s;tatement of the article with re|gard to the po&s;ts included likewi&s;e compen&s;ation for their detention?

Great-Britain in the&s;e two particulars, for which no provi&s;ion could be made, might well exceed any lo&s;&s;es to us by the detention of the po&s;ts?</P>
<P>In the la&s;t place, the compen&s;ation &s;tipulated was a <HI>&s;ine quanon</HI> with Great Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tain of the &s;urrender of the po&s;ts, and the adju&s;tment of the controver&s;y which had &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;i&s;ted between the two countries. The making it &s;uch may be conceived to have been dictated more by the importance of the precedent, than by the quantum of the &s;um in que&s;tion. We &s;hall ea&s;ily under&s;tand this, if we con&s;ider how much the commercial capital <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f Great-Britain is &s;pread over the world. The va&s;t credits &s;he is in the habit of extending to foreign coun|tries, renders it to her an e&s;&s;ential point to protect tho&s;e credits by all the &s;anctions in her power. She cannot forbear to contend at every hazard again&s;t precedents of the inva&s;ion of the rights of her merchants and for retribution where any happen. Hence it is al|ways to be expected, that &s;he will be pecu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iarly inflexible on this point; and that nothing &s;hort of extreme nece&s;&s;ity can bring her to relax in an article of policy, which, perhaps not le&s;s than any other, is a nece&s;&s;ary prop of the whole &s;y&s;tem of her political oeconomy.</P>
<P>It was, therefore, to have been fore&s;een that whenever our con|trover&s;y with Great-Britain was adju&s;ted, compen&s;ation for ob|&s;tructions to the recovery of debts wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d make a part of the adju&s;t|ment. The option lay between compen&s;ation, relinqui&s;hment of the po&s;ts, or war. Our envoy is entitled to the applau&s;e of all good men, for preferring the fir&s;t. The extent of the compen&s;ation can on no po&s;&s;ible &s;cale compare with the immen&s;e permanent value of the po&s;ts, or with the expences of the war. The &s;phere of the in|terferences has been too partial to make the &s;um of the compen&s;ati|on, in any event, a very &s;erious object, and as to war, a con&s;cienti|ous or virtuous mind could never endure the thoughts of &s;eeing the country involved in its calamities, to get rid of an act of ju&s;tice to individuals, who&s;e rights in contempt to public faith, had been vio|lated.</P>
<P>Having reviewed the general con&s;iderations which ju&s;tify the &s;tipu|lation of compen&s;ation, it will be proper to examine if the plan upon which it is to be made is unexceptionable.</P>
<P>This plan contains the following features&mdash;1. The ca&s;es provid|ed for are tho&s;e, "where lo&s;&s;es and damages occa&s;ioned by the ope|ration of lawful impediments (which &s;ince the peace have delayed the full recovery of Briti&s;h debts, bona fide contracted before the peace, and &s;till owing to the creditors, and have impaired and le&s;&s;en|ed the value and &s;ecurity thereof) cannot now, for whatever rea&s;on, be actually obtained in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice. 2. There is an expre&s;s exception out of this provi&s;ion of all the ca&s;es in which lo&s;&s;es and damages have been occa&s;ioned by &s;uch in&s;olvency of the debtors, or other cau&s;es, as would equally have operated to produce them, if no legal impediments had exi&s;ted, or by the manife&s;t delay, or negligence, or wilful omi&s;&s;ion, of the claimants. 3. The amount of the lo&s;&s;es and damages for which compen&s;ation is to be made, is to be a&s;certained by five commi&s;&s;ioners to be appointed as follows: two by his Britannic maje&s;ty, two by the Pre&s;ident with the advice and con&s;ent of the &s;enate, the fifth by the unanimous voice of the&s;e four, if they can agree, if they cannot agree, then to be taken by

lot out of two per&s;ons, one of whom to be named by the two Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, the other by the two American commi&s;&s;ioners. 4. The&s;e five commi&s;&s;ioners thus appointed, are before they proceed to the execution of their tru&s;t to take an oath for its faithful di&s;charge, Three of them to con&s;titute a board; but there mu&s;t be pre&s;ent one of the two commi&s;&s;ioners named on each &s;ide, and the fifth com|mi&s;&s;ioner. Deci&s;ions to be made by majority of voices of tho&s;e pre|&s;ent. They are fir&s;t to meet at Philadelphia, but may adjourn from place to place as they &s;ee cau&s;e. 5. Eighteen months after the com|mi&s;&s;ioners make a board are a&s;&s;igned for receiving applications, but the commi&s;&s;ioners in particular ca&s;es may extend the term not ex|ceeding 6 months. 6. The commi&s;&s;ioners are empowered to take into con&s;ideration all cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ims whether of principal or intere&s;t or balanc|es of principal and intere&s;t, and to determine them according to the merits and circum&s;tances thereof, and as ju&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce and equi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;hall ap|pear to them to require&mdash;to examine per&s;ons on oath or affirmation, and to receive in evidence d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">po&s;itions, books, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pers or copies, or extracts thereof, either according to the legal forms exi&s;ting in the two countries, or according to a mode to be divi&s;ed by them. 7. Their award is to be conclu&s;ive; and the United States are to cau&s;e the &s;um awarded in each ca&s;e to be paid in &s;pecie to the creditor without de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uction, and at &s;uch time and place as &s;hall have been awarded; but no payment to be required &s;ooner than twelve months from the day of the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty</P>
<P>This provi&s;ion for a&s;certaining the compen&s;ation to be made, while it is ample, is al&s;o well guarded.</P>
<P>It is confined to debts contracted before the peace, and &s;till owing to the creditors. It embraces only the ca&s;es of lo&s;s or damage in con&s;equence of legal impediments to the recovery of tho&s;e debts which will exclude all ca&s;es of voluntary compromi&s;e, and can in|clude none where the laws have allowed a free cour&s;e to ju&s;tice. It can operate in no in&s;tance where, at pre&s;ent, the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice is competent to full relief, and the debtor is &s;olvent, nor in any, where in&s;olvency or other cau&s;e would have operated to pro|duce the lo&s;s or damage, if no legal impediment had exi&s;ted, or where it has been occa&s;ioned by the wilful delay negligence or omi&s;&s;ion of the creditor.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid that the commi&s;&s;ioners have neverthele&s;s much lati|tude of di&s;cretion, and that in the exerci&s;e of it they may tran&s;gre&s;s the limits intended, the an&s;wer is, that the United States, though bound to perform what they have &s;tipulated with good faith, would not be bound to &s;ubmit to a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nife&s;t abu&s;e of authority by the com|mi&s;&s;ioners. Should they palpably exceed their commi&s;&s;ion, or abu&s;e their tru&s;t, the United States may ju&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fiably, though at their peril, refu&s;e compliance. For example, if they &s;hould undertake to award upon a debt contracted &s;ince the peace, there could be no doubt that their award would be a nullity. So likewi&s;e there might be other plain ca&s;es of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;conduct, which in honor and con&s;cience would exonorate the United States from performance. It is only incum|bent upon them to act bona fide, and as they act at their peril to examine well the &s;oundne&s;s of the ground on which they proceed.</P>
<P>With regard to the reference to commi&s;&s;i&s;ioners to &s;ettle the quan|tum of the compen&s;ation to be made, this cour&s;e was dictated by the
<PB N="82" REF="028795_0082_0FDD4A14AA20CE28">
nature of the ca&s;e. The t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ibunals of neither country were compe|tent to a re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ro&s;pective adju&s;tment of lo&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and damages, in many ca&s;|es which might require it. It is for this very rea&s;on of the incom|petency of the ordinary tribunals to do complete ju&s;tice, that a &s;pe|cial &s;tipulation of compen&s;ation, and a &s;pecial mode of obtaining it became nece&s;&s;ary. In c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;tituting a tribunal to liquidate the quan|tum of reparation in the ca&s;e of a breach of treaty, it is natural and ju&s;t to divi&s;e one likely to be more certainly impartial than the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed courts of either party. Without impeaching the integrity of tho&s;e courts, it was morally impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould not feel a bias towards the nation to which they belonged, and for that very rea&s;on they were un&s;it arbitrators. In the ca&s;e of the &s;poliations of our property, we &s;hould undoubtedly have been unwilling to leave the adju&s;tment in the la&s;t re&s;ort to the Briti&s;h courts; and by parity of rea&s;on, they could not be expected to refer the liquidation of compen&s;ation in the ca&s;e of the debts to our courts. To have pre&s;&s;ed this would have been to weaken our argument for a diffe|rent cour&s;e in regard to the &s;poliations. We &s;hould have been puz|zled to find a &s;ub&s;tantial principle of di&s;crimination.</P>
<P>If a &s;pecial and extraordinary trib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was to be con&s;tituted, it was impracticable to contrive a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fair and equitable plan for it, than that which has been adopted. The remarks on the mode of determining the que&s;tion re&s;pecting the river St. Croix, apply in full force here, and would render a particular comment &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>To the objection of the Charle&s;ton committee, that the article erects a tribunal unknown to our con&s;titution, and transfers to com|mi&s;&s;ioners the cognizance of matters appertaining to American courts and juries, the an&s;wer is &s;imple and conclu&s;ive. The tribunals e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by the con&s;titution do not contemplate a ca&s;e between n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ti|on and nation ari&s;ing upon a breach of treaty, and are inadequate to the cognizance of it.&mdash;Could either of them hold plea of a &s;uit of Great-Britain plaintiff aga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;t the United States defendant? The ca&s;e therefore required the erection or con&s;titution of a new tribunal and it was mo&s;t likely to promote equity to pa&s;s by the Courts of both the parties.</P>
<P>The &s;ame principle contradicts the po&s;ition that there has been any transfer of jur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;diction from American courts and juries to com|mi&s;&s;ioners. It is a que&s;tion not between individual and individual, or between our government and individuals, but between our go|vernment and the Briti&s;h government. Of cour&s;e, one in which our courts and juries, have no juri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">diction. There was a nece&s;&s;ity for an extraordinary tribunal to &s;upply the defect of ordinary juri&s;diction, and &s;o far is the article from making the transfer imputed to it, that it expre&s;sly excepts the ca&s;es in which effectual relief can be obtain|ed in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Nations acknowledging no common judge on earth, when they are willing to &s;ubmit the que&s;tons between them to a judicial deci&s;i|on, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity con&s;titute a &s;pecial tribunal for the purpo&s;e. The mode by commi&s;&s;ioners, as being the mo&s;t unexceptionable, has been repeatedly adopted.</P>
<P>I proceed to reply to &s;ome other objections which have been made again&s;t the provi&s;ion contained in this article.</P>
<P>It is charged with fixing a &s;tigma on the national character by pro|viding
<PB N="83" REF="028795_0083_0FDD4A483ABAFD08">
reparation for an infraction, which, if it ever did exi&s;t, has been done away, there being now a free cour&s;e to the recovery of Briti&s;h debts in the Courts of the United States.</P>
<P>An an&s;wer to this objection has been anticipated by &s;ome ob&s;erva|tions heretofore made. The giving a free cour&s;e to ju&s;tice in favour of Briti&s;h creditors, which has been effected by the new con&s;titution of the United States, though it obviates the future operation of legal impediments, does not retro&s;pectively repair the lo&s;&s;es and damages which may have re&s;ulted from their pa&s;t operation. In this re&s;pect the effects continued and reparation was due. To promi&s;e it, could fix no &s;tigma on our national character. That was done by the acts which created the cau&s;e for reparation. To make it, was as far as po&s;&s;ible to remove the &s;tigma.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that the promi&s;e of compen&s;ation produces inju&s;|tice to tho&s;e &s;tates which interpo&s;ed no legal impediments to the re|covery of debts, by &s;addling them with a part of the burthen ari&s;ing from the delinquencies of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing &s;tates. But the burden was before a&s;&s;umed by the treaty of peace. The article of that trea|ty which engaged that there &s;hould be no lawful impediments to the recovery of debts, was a <HI>guarantee</HI> by the United States of ju&s;tice to the Briti&s;h creditors. It charged them with the duty of taking care that there was no legal ob&s;tacle to the recovery of the debts of tho&s;e creditors, and con&s;equently with a re&s;pon&s;ibility for any &s;uch ob|&s;tacle which &s;hould happen, and with the obligation of making repa|ration for it. We mu&s;t therefore refer to the treaty of peace, not to the la&s;t treaty, the common charge which has been incurred by interference in the recovery of Briti&s;h debts. The latter only carries into execution the promi&s;e made by the former. It may be added that it is a condition of the &s;ocial compact that the nation at large &s;hall make retribution to foreign nations for injuries done to them by its members.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that Mr. Jeffer&s;on has clearly &s;hewn, that intere&s;t in ca&s;es like that of the Briti&s;h debts, is liable, during the period of the war, to equitable abatements and deductions: and that, therefore, the di&s;cretion given to the commi&s;&s;ioners on this head, ought not to have been as large as it appears in the article.</P>
<P>Mr. Jef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;on has no doubt, offered arguments of real weight to e&s;tabli&s;h the po&s;ition that judges and juries have, and exerci&s;e a de|gree of di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etion in the article of intere&s;t, and that the circum&s;tances of our war with Britain, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng rea&s;ons for abatements of inte|re&s;t. But it was foreign to his purpo&s;e and accordingly he has not attempted to particulari&s;e the rules which ought to govern in the ap|plication of this principle to the variety of ca&s;es in which the que&s;|tion may ari&s;e&mdash;and he has him&s;elf noted that the practice, in diffe|rent &s;tates and in different courts, has been attended with great diver&s;ity. Indeed, admitting the right to abate intere&s;t under &s;pecial circum&s;tances, in ca&s;es in which it is the general rule to allow it, the circum&s;tances of each ca&s;e, are, perhaps, the only true criterion of the propriety of an exception. The particular nature of the con|tract, the circum&s;tances under which it was entered into, the relative &s;ituation of parties, the po&s;&s;ibility or not of mutual acce&s;s; the&s;e and other things would guide and vary the exerci&s;e of the di&s;cretion to abate. It was, therefore, right to leave the commi&s;&s;ioners, as they
<PB N="84" REF="028795_0084_0FDD4A191F7705F0">
are left, in the &s;ame &s;ituation with judges and juries; to act accord|ing to the true equity of the &s;everal ca&s;es, or of the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Let it be remembered, that the government of Great-Britain has to con&s;ult the intere&s;ts and opinions of its citizens, as well as the government of the United States tho&s;e of their citizens. The only &s;atisfactory cour&s;e which the former could pur&s;ue, in reference to its merchants was to turn over the whole que&s;tion of intere&s;t as well as principal, to the commi&s;&s;ioners. And as this was truly equitable, the government of the United States could make no well founded oppo&s;ition to it.</P>

<P>IT is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the 7th art. of the treaty, to provide for two objects: o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, compen&s;ation to our citizens for injuries to their property, by irregular or illegal captures or condemnations; the other, compen&s;ation to Briti&s;h citizens for captures of their property within the limits and juri&s;diction of the United States, or el&s;ewhere, by ve&s;&s;els originally armed in our ports, <HI>in the ca&s;es in which the cap|tured property having come within our po&s;ts and power, there was a neglect to make re&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P>The f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;t object is thus provided for: 1. It is agreed, that in all ca&s;es of irregular or illegal captures or condemnations of the ve&s;&s;els and other property of citizens of the United States, under colour of authority or commi&s;&s;ions from his Britannic Maje&s;ty, in which ade|quate compen&s;ation for the lo&s;&s;es and damages &s;u&s;tained, cannot, for whatever rea&s;on, be actually obtained in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;|tice, full and complete compen&s;ation for the &s;ame will be made by the Briti&s;h government to the claimants; except where the lo&s;s or da|mage may have been occa&s;ioned by the manife&s;t delay, or negligence, or willful omi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e claimants. 2. The amount of the lo&s;&s;es and damages to be compen&s;ated is to be a&s;certained by five commi&s;|&s;ioners, who are to be appointed in exactly the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e for liquidating the compen&s;ation to Briti&s;h creditors. 3. The&s;e com|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ioners are to make a &s;imilar oath, and to exerci&s;e &s;imilar powers for the inve&s;tigation of claims with tho&s;e other commi&s;&s;ioners, and they are to decide according to the merits of the &s;everal ca&s;es and to ju&s;tice, equity, and the laws of nations. 4. The &s;ame term of eigh|teen months is allowed for the reception of claims, with a like di&s;|cretion to extend the term as in the ca&s;e of Briti&s;h debts. 5. The award of the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, or of three of them, under the like guards as in that ca&s;e, is to be final and conclu&s;ive, both as to the ju&s;tice of the claim and the amount of the compen&s;ation. And la&s;t|ly, his Brittannic Maje&s;ty is to cau&s;e the compen&s;ation awarded, to be paid to the claimants in &s;pecie, without deduction, at &s;uch times and places, and upon the condition of &s;uch relea&s;es or a&s;&s;ignments, as the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hall pre&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Maturely and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately examined, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to be
<PB N="85" REF="028795_0085_0FDD4A49D65C0F60">
convinced, that this provi&s;ion is ample, and ought to be &s;atisfactory. The cour&s;e of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion will exhibit various proofs of the di&s;in|genuou&s;ne&s;s of the clamours again&s;t it, but it will be pertinent to in|troduce here one or two &s;amples of it.</P>
<P>It has been alledged, that while the article preceding and this article provide effecttually for every demand of Great Britain again&s;t the United States, the provi&s;ion for this important and urgent claim of ours is neither explicit, nor efficient, nor co-exten&s;ive with the object, nor bears any proportion to the <HI>&s;ummary method,</HI> adopted for the &s;atisfying of Briti&s;h claims.</P>
<P>This &s;ugge&s;tion is every way unfortunate. The plan for &s;atisfying our claim, except as to the de&s;cription of the &s;ubject which varies with it, is an exact copy of that for making compen&s;ation to Briti&s;h creditors. Whoever will take the pains to compare, will find, that in the leading points, literal conformity is &s;tudied, and that in others, the provi&s;ions are a&s;&s;imilated by direct references; &amp; will di&s;cover al&s;o, this important di&s;tinction in favour of the efficiency and &s;um|marine&s;s of the provi&s;ion for our claim&mdash;that while the commi&s;&s;i|oners are expre&s;sly re&s;tricted from awarding payment to Briti&s;h creditors, to be made &s;ooner than one year after the exchange of ratifications of the treaty, they are free to award it, to be made the very day of their deci&s;ion, for the &s;poliations of our property. As to the compen&s;ation for Briti&s;h property, captured within our limits, or by ve&s;&s;els originally armed in our ports and not re&s;tored, which is the only other Briti&s;h claim that has been provided for, it happens that this forming a part of the very article we are con&s;idering, is &s;ubmit|ted to the identical mode of relief, which is in&s;tituted for making &s;atisfaction to us.</P>
<P>So far then is it from being true, that a compari&s;on of the modes of redre&s;s provided by the treaty, for the complaints of the re&s;pec|tive parties, turns to our di&s;advantage, that the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e exhibits a &s;ub&s;tantial &s;imilitude with only one material difference, and that in our favour; and, that a &s;trong argument for the equity of the provi&s;ions on each &s;ide, is to be drawn from their clo&s;e re&s;em|blance of each other.</P>
<P>The other &s;ugge&s;tion alluded to, and which has been &s;hamele&s;sly reiterated, is, that Denmark and Sweden, by pur&s;uing a more &s;piri|ted conduct, had obtained better terms than the United States. It is even pretended, that one or both of them had actually recei|ved from Great Britain a gro&s;s &s;um on account&mdash;in anticipation of an ultimate liquidation. In my &s;econd number, the erroneou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;uppo&s;ition, that tho&s;e powers had obtained more than the United States was intimated, but the &s;ub&s;equent repetition of the idea, more covertly in print, and very openly and confidently in conver&s;ation, renders expedient an explicit and peremptory denial of the fact. There never has appeared a particle of evidence to &s;upport it, and after chal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enging the a&s;&s;erters of it to produce the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r proof, I aver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that careful enquiry at &s;ources of information, at lea&s;t as direct and authentic as then's, has &s;atisfied me, that the &s;ugge&s;|tion is wholly un&s;ounded, and that at the time of the conclu|&s;ion of our treaty with Great Britain, both Sweden and Denmark were behind us in the effect of their mea&s;ures for obtaining reparation.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="028795_0086_0FDD4A1A9D6E5CE0">What are we to think of attempts like the&s;e, to dupe and imi|tate the public mind? Will any prudent citizen &s;till con&s;ent to fol|low &s;uch blind or &s;uch treacherous guides?</P>
<P>Let us now, under the influence of a calm and candid temper, without which truth eludes our re&s;earches, by a clo&s;e &s;crutiny of the provi&s;ion, &s;atisfy our&s;elves whether it be not really a rea&s;onable and proper one.&mdash;But previous to this i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">qui&s;ite to advert to a colla|teral mea&s;ure which was al&s;o a fruit of the mi&s;&s;ion to Great Britain, and which ought to be taken in conjunction with the &s;tipulation in this article. I refer to the order of the Briti&s;h king in council, of the 6th of Augu&s;t, 1794, by which order, the door before &s;hut by lap&s;e of time, is opened to appeals from the Briti&s;h We&s;t India courts of admiralty, to be brought at any time which &s;hall be judged rea&s;onable by the lords commi&s;&s;ioners of appeals in prize cau&s;es. This of it&s;elf was no incon&s;iderable &s;tep to wards the redre&s;s of our grievances, and it may be hoped, that with the aid which the government of the United States has given to facilitate appeals, much relief may en&s;ue from this mea&s;ure. It will not be wonderful if it &s;hould comport with the pride and policy of the Briti&s;h govern|ment, by pronouncing ju&s;tice in their courts, to leave as little as po&s;&s;ible to be done by the commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>A cavil has been rai&s;ed on the meaning of the word, colour, which it is pretended would not reach the ca&s;es de&s;igned to be entraced, be|cau&s;e the &s;poliations complained of, were made, not merely by <HI>colour,</HI> but actually by <HI>virtue</HI> of in&s;tructions from the Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ti&s;h government.</P>
<P>For the very rea&s;on, that this &s;ubtil and artificial meaning a&s;cribed to the term, would tend to defeat the manife&s;t general intent of the main provi&s;ion of the article, which is plainly to give reparation, for regular or illegal captures or condemnations of American pro|perty, contrary to the laws of nations&mdash;that meaning mu&s;t be deem|ed inadmi&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But in fact, the expre&s;&s;ion is the mo&s;t accurate that could have been u&s;ed, to &s;ignify the real intent of the article. When we &s;ay a thing was done by colour of an authority or commi&s;&s;ion, we mean one of three things; that it was done on the pretence of a <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> authority or commi&s;&s;ion <HI>not validly</HI> imparted, or on the pretence of <HI>&s;uch</HI> an authority or commi&s;&s;ion <HI>validly</HI> imparted but <HI>abu&s;ed</HI> or <HI>mi&s;|applied,</HI> or on the pretence of an <HI>in&s;ufficient</HI> authority or commi&s;&s;ion regularly, as to form imparted and exerci&s;ed.&mdash;It denotes a defect of rightful and ju&s;t authority, whether emanating from a wrong &s;ource, or improperly from a right &s;ource; whereas the phra&s;e, "by virtue of," is mo&s;t properly applicable to the valid exerci&s;e of a valid authority. But the two phra&s;es are not unfrequently u&s;ed as &s;ynonimous. Thus in the proclamation of the Briti&s;h king, of the 25th of May, 1792, he among other things forbids all his &s;ubje&s;ts, by <HI>virtue</HI> or under <HI>colour</HI> of any foreign commi&s;&s;ion or letters of or repri&s;als to di&s;turb, infe&s;t, or damage the &s;ubjects of France.</P>

<P>The critici&s;m however fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ls on its own principle, when te&s;ted by the fact. The great &s;ource of grievance, intended to be re|dre&s;&s;ed by the article, proceeded from the in&s;truction of the 6th No|vember, 1793. That in&s;truction directs the commanders of &s;hips of war and privateers, to &s;top and detain all &s;hips laden with goods, the produce of any colony belonging to France, or carrying provi&s;i|ons and other &s;upplies for the u&s;e of &s;uch colony, and to bring the &s;ame with their cargoes to <HI>legal adjudication</HI> in the Briti&s;h courts of admiralty.

Yet the Briti&s;h We&s;t India courts of admiralty app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o have generally acted upon the term as &s;ynonimous with condemnation. In doing this, they may be truly &s;aid, even in the &s;en&s;e of the objection, to have acted by colour only of the in|&s;truction.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h cabinet have di&s;avowed this con&s;truction of the We&s;t India courts, and have as we have &s;een, by a &s;pecial act of interfe|rence, opened a door which was before &s;hut to a rever&s;al of their &s;entences, by appeal to the courts in England. We find al&s;o that the term adjudication is u&s;ed in the XVIIth article of our late treaty as &s;ynonimous only with judicial d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ci&s;ion, according to its true import. This if any thing were wanting, would render it impo&s;&s;i|ble for the commi&s;&s;ioners to refu&s;e redre&s;s on the ground of the condemnations, if otherwi&s;e illegal, being warranted by the pre|tended &s;en&s;e of the words legal adjudication. But in reality, as before ob&s;erved, their commi&s;&s;ion will be to award compen&s;ation in all ca&s;es in which they are of opinion, that according to the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of nations, captures or condemnations were irregular or illegal, how|ever otherwi&s;e authori&s;ed; and this in contempt of the quibbling critici&s;m which has been &s;o cunningly devi&s;ed.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The provi&s;ion under con&s;ideration, obliges the Briti&s;h Go|vernment, in all ca&s;es of illegal captures or condemnations, in which adequate compen&s;ation cannot, for whatever rea&s;on, be actually had in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, to make full and complete com|pen&s;ation to the claimants which is to be paid in &s;pecie to them&s;elves without deduction at &s;uch times and places as &s;hall be awarded.</P>

Could it have been believed that &s;o palpable an error could have been impo&s;ed on a town meeting in the face of &s;o plain a provi&s;ion, as to induce it to charge again&s;t this article, that in a national concern of the United States, redre&s;s was left to Briti&s;h courts of admiralty? yet, &s;trange as it may appear, this did happen even in the truly enlightened town of Bo&s;ton&mdash;The ju&s;t pride of that town will not quickly forget that it has been &s;o compromitted.</P>
<P>The truth is, that according to the common u&s;age of nations, the courts of admiralty of the belligerent parties are the channels through which the redre&s;s of injuries to neutrals is &s;ought. But Great Britain has been brought to agree to refer all the ca&s;es in which ju&s;tice can|not be obtained through tho&s;e channels, to an extraordinary tribunal &mdash;in other words to arbitrators mutually appointed.</P>
<P>It is here, that we find the reparation of the natitional wrong which we had &s;uffered.

<P>As it regards our honour, this is anadequate, atonement, and the only cies u&s;ual in &s;imilar ca&s;es between nations; pecuniary compen&s;ati|on is the true reparation in &s;uch ca&s;es&mdash;governments are not apt to go upon their knees to a&s;k pardon of other governments&mdash;Great Britain, in the recent in&s;tance of the di&s;pute with Spain, about Nootha Sound, was glad to accept of a like reparation. It merits re|mark, incidentally, that the in&s;trument which &s;ettles this di&s;pute expre&s;sly waves, like our treaty, reference to the merits of the com|plaints and preten&s;ions of the re&s;pective parties. Is our &s;ituation &s;uch as to authori&s;e us to pretend to impo&s;e humiliating conditions on other nations?</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h between injuries and in&s;ults, which we are too apt to confound. The &s;eizures and &s;poilations of our pro|perty fall mo&s;t truly under the former head.

opinion, ill founded. It was accompanid al&s;o by compen&s;ation for what was taken, and other circum&s;tances that evinced a de&s;ire to &s;mooth the act. The indi&s;criminate confi&s;cation of our property, up|on the order of the 6th November, which was the truly flagrant inju|ry, was certainly unwarranted by that order (and no &s;ecret one has appeared)&mdash;and the matter has been &s;o explained by the Briti&s;h go|vernment. It is clear that evils &s;uffered under acts &s;o circum&s;tanced are injuries rather than in&s;ults&mdash;and are &s;o much the more managea|ble as to the &s;pecies and mea&s;ure of redre&s;s. It would be quiox|ti&s;m to a&s;&s;ert that we might not honourably accept in &s;uch a ca&s;e the pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y reparation which has been &s;tipulated.</P>

<P>A little calm reflection will convince us that neither of the two la&s;t things was to be expected. There was ab&s;olutely no criterion, either for a full indemnification, or for an advance upon account. The value of the property &s;eized and condemned (laying out of the ca&s;e, damages upon captures where condemnation had not en&s;ued) was not a&s;certained, even to our own government, with any tolerable accuracy. Every well informed man will think it probable, that of this a proportion not incon&s;iderable was covered French property. There were, therefore, no adequate data, upon which our government could demand, or the Briti&s;h government pay a determinate &s;um. Both governments mu&s;t have acted e&s;&s;entially by gue&s;s.&mdash;Ours could not in honour or con&s;cience have made even an e&s;timate but up|on evidence. It might have happened that a &s;um which appeared upon the evidence that had been collected &s;ufficient, might have pro|ved on further evidence in&s;ufficient.&mdash;Too little as well as too much, might have been demanded and paid. But it will perhaps be &s;aid, that &s;ome gro&s;s e&s;timate might have been formed; and that of this, &s;uch a part might have been advanced upon account, as was within the narrowe&s;t probable limit, liable to eventual adju&s;tment. Let us for a moment &s;uppo&s;e this done&mdash;What good end would it have an&s;wered? How could the United States have di&s;tributed this money among the &s;ufferers till it was a&s;certained which of them was truly entitled, and to how much? Is it not evident, that if they had made any di&s;tribution before the final &amp; perfect inve&s;tigation of the right of each claimant, it would be at the ri&s;k of making mi&s;|payments, and of being obliged to replace the &s;ums mi&s;paid, perhaps at a lo&s;s to the United States, for the benefit of tho&s;e who &s;hould be found to be better entitled? Would it have been expedient for our government to have incurred this ri&s;k to its con&s;tituents?&mdash;And if the money was to be held undi&s;tributed till an inve&s;tigation of claims was completed, to what purpo&s;e the ha&s;te about an advance?</P>
<P>On the other hand; is it in this loo&s;e gro&s;s way that nations tran&s;act affairs with each other? Do even individuals make indemnificati|ons to one another in &s;o lumping a manner? Could it be expected of Great-Britain, that &s;he would pay till it was fairly a&s;certained what was to be paid; e&s;pecially when &s;he had too much cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect, that a material proportion of the property claimed might turn out to be French? Would it have been ju&s;tifiable on our part, to
<PB N="90" REF="028795_0090_0FDD4A90426A58E0">
make her compliance with &s;uch a demand, the <HI>&s;ine qua non</HI> of accom|modation and peace? Whoever will believe that &s;he would have com|piled with &s;o humiliating a requi&s;ition&punc; mu&s;t be per&s;uaded that we were in a condition to dictate, and &s;he in a condition to be obliged to receive any terms that we might think fit to pre&s;cribe? The per&s;on who can believe this mu&s;t be, in my opinion, under the influence of a delirium, for which there is no cure in the re&s;ources of rea&s;on and argument.</P>
<P>If it mu&s;t be admitted that it was matter of nece&s;&s;ity that inve&s;tiga|tion &s;hould precede p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ment; then I &s;ee not what more &s;ummary mode could have been devi&s;ed? Who more capable of proceeding with di&s;patch than arbitrators untrammeled with legal forms; ve&s;ted with powers to examine parties and others, on oath, and to command and receive all evidence in their own way? Here are all the means of expedition dive&s;ted of every clog.</P>
<P>Eighteen months are allowed for preferring claims, but the com|mi&s;&s;ioners are at liberty to adju&s;t them as fa&s;t as they are preferred. In every ca&s;e in which it appears to them <HI>bona fide,</HI> that the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice is inadequate to relief, they may forthwith proceed to examine and decide. There is no impediment, no cau&s;e of delay whatever, more than the nature of a due inve&s;tigation always re|quires.</P>
<P>The meeting of the commi&s;&s;ioners at London was recommended by the circum&s;tance, that the admiralty courts were likely to concenter there, a con&s;iderable part of the evidence on which they were to pro|ceed; which upon the whole might favour di&s;patch as well as more complete ju&s;tice. In many ca&s;es the deci&s;ions of tho&s;e courts may come under their review.</P>
<P>As to uncertainty of the event, this, as far as it may be true, was in&s;eparable from any plan, bottomed on the idea of a previous inve&s;|&s;tigation of claims; and it has been &s;hewn, that &s;ome &s;uch plan was rea&s;onable and inevitable.</P>
<P>It may be al&s;o added, that the plan affords a moral certainty of &s;ub|&s;tantial ju&s;tice, which is all that can rationnally be expected in &s;imilar affairs. Compen&s;ation where due is explicitly &s;tipulated: A fair and adequate mode of deciding and liquidating it has been &s;ettled. All the arguments which were adduced to prove the probability of good faith, in regard to the po&s;ts, apply equally to this &s;ubject. The inte|re&s;t which every nation has in the pre&s;ervation of character, and which the mo&s;t profligate dare not entirely di&s;regard. The con|&s;ideration of defeating the fulfilment of the &s;tipulations on our part, &mdash;the &s;ize of the object, certainly not of great magnitude&mdash;the very di&s;couraging &s;ituation for replunging &s;uddenly into a new war, in which the pre&s;ent war will in every event leave Great Britain. The&s;e are rea&s;ons which afford &s;olid ground of a&s;&s;urances that there will be no eva&s;ion of performance.</P>
<P>As to the commi&s;&s;ioners, two of the five will certainly be of our choice, a third may be &s;o likewi&s;e; but &s;hould it prove otherwi&s;e, it will be &s;urpri&s;ing if one of the other three, all acting under oath, and having character at &s;take, &s;hall not be di&s;po&s;ed to do us rea&s;onable ju&s;tice.</P>

<P>This preci&s;e view of the thing &s;tipulated, is calculated to place the whole &s;ubject at once before the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in its true &s;hape; to evince the rea&s;onablene&s;s of it, and to di&s;mi&s;s the objections which have been made, as being foreign to the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e. The&s;e ob|jections are in &s;ub&s;tance, that the compen&s;ation promi&s;ed is of great and indefinite extent and amount; that an enormous expence is likely to be incurred; and that it is difficult to prove, that a neutral nati|on is under an obliga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion to go the length of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion.</P>

<P>It will follow from this, that the ca&s;es within the purview of the ar+ticle mu&s;t be very few&mdash;for, except with regard to three prizes made in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, where &s;pecial con&s;iderations re&s;trained the go|vernment from interpo&s;ing, there has been a regular and con&s;tant effort of the executive, in which our courts have efficaciou&s;ly co-ope|rated, to re&s;tore prizes made within our juri&s;diction, or by ve&s;&s;els armed in our ports.

<P>Let us, however, examine if the con&s;truction I give to the clau&s;e be the true one.</P>

<P>Every treaty we have made with foreign powers, promi&s;es protec|tion within our juri&s;diction and the re&s;toration of proper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y taken there. A &s;imilar &s;tipulation is a general formula in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eaties, giving an expre&s;s &s;anction to the rule of the laws of nations in this particular.</P>
<P>An act of Congre&s;s, of the 5th of June, 1794, which is expre&s;s|ly a declaratory act, recogni&s;es at large the foregoing principles of the laws of nations, providing, among other things, for the puni&s;h|ment of any per&s;on, who, within the United States fits out and arms, or at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">empts to fit out and arm, or procures to be fitted out and arm|ed, or is knowingly concerned in furni&s;hing, fitting out or arming, of any &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el, with intent to be employed in the &s;ervice of a foreign &s;tate, to crui&s;e or commit ho&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lities upon the &s;ubjects or citi|zens of another foreign &s;tate, with which the United States are at peace, or i&s;&s;ues or delivers a commi&s;&s;ion for any &s;uch &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el, or increa&s;es or augments, or procures to be increa&s;ed or augmen|ted, or is knowingly concerned in increa&s;ing or augm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nting the force of any &s;hip of war, crui&s;er or other armed ve&s;&s;el, in the &s;ervice of a foreign &s;tate, at war with another foreign &s;tate, with which the United States are at peace, or within the territory of the United States, be|gins or &s;ets on foot, or provides or prepares the means of any mili|tary expedition or enterpri&s;e to be carried on from thence again&s;t the dominions of any foreign &s;tate, with which the United States are at peace.</P>
<P>And our courts have adopted in its fulle&s;t latitude, as conforma|ble in their opinion with tho&s;e laws, the principle of re&s;titution of property, when either captured within our juri&s;diction, or el&s;e|where by ve&s;&s;els armed in our ports. The &s;upreme court of the United States has given to this doctrine by &s;olemn dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ions the mo&s;t complete and comprehenv&s;ie &s;anction.</P>
<P>It is, therefore, undoubtedly the law of the land, determined by the proper con&s;titutional tribunal in the la&s;t re&s;ort, that <HI>re&s;titution is due</HI> in the abovementioned ca&s;es.</P>
<P>And it is a direct and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence from this, that where it is not made by rea&s;on of the neglect of the government to u&s;e the means in its power for the purpo&s;e.&mdash;There re&s;ults an obligation to make reparation. For between nations, as between individuals, wherever there exi&s;ts a perfect obligation to do a thing, there is a
<PB N="95" REF="028795_0095_0FDD4A7D759767F8">
concomitant obligation to make reparation for omi&s;&s;ions and neglects.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident was, therefore, mo&s;t &s;trictly ju&s;tifiable, upon princi|ple, in the opinion which he communicated, that in the ca&s;es of &s;uch omi&s;&s;ions or neglects, compen&s;ation ought to be made. And in point of policy, nothing could be wi&s;er; for had he not done it, there is the highe&s;t probability that war would have en&s;ued.</P>
<P>Our treaty with France forbids us expre&s;sly to permit the priva|teers of the enemy to arm in our ports, or to bring or &s;ell there the prizes which they have made upon her. We could not, for that rea&s;on, have made the privilege of arming in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ports if it had been allowed to France reciprocal&mdash;The allowance of it to her would con&s;equently have been a clear violation of neutrality, in the double &s;en&s;e of permitting a military aid, and of permitting it to the one and refu&s;ing it to the other. Had we &s;uffered France to equip privateers in our ports to cruize thence upon her enemies, and to bring back and vend there the &s;poils or prizes taken, we &s;hould have become by this the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous foe they could have: For while all our naval re&s;ources might have augmented the force of France, our neutrality, if tolerated, would in a great degree have &s;heltered and protected her crui&s;ers. Such a &s;tate of things no nation at war could have acquie&s;ced in.&mdash;And as well to the efficacy of our endeavours to prevent equipments in our ports, as to the proof of the &s;incerity of tho&s;e endeavours, it was e&s;&s;ential that we &s;hould re&s;tore the prizes which came within our reach, made by ve&s;&s;els armed in our ports. It is known, that notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t efforts of the government to prevent it, French privateers have been clande&s;tinely equipped in &s;ome of our ports &s;ub&s;equent to the a&s;&s;urances which were given that the practice would be di&s;countenanced. If prizes made by &s;uch ve&s;&s;els were &s;uffered to be brought into our ports and &s;old there, this would be not only a very great encouragement to the practice, but it would be impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould be regarded in any other light than as a connivance. In &s;uch circum&s;tances can we blame our chief magi&s;|trate? Can we even deny him prai&s;e for having diverted an imminent danger to our peace, by incurring the re&s;pon&s;ibility of giving an ex|pectation of compen&s;ation? The conjuncture we may remember was critical and urgent. Congre&s;s were at the time in rece&s;s. A due notice to convene them in &s;o exten&s;ive a country, can hardly be rated at le&s;s than three months.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation our envoy found the bu&s;ine&s;s. It is not true, in the &s;en&s;e in which it has been advanced, that he was to be governed by the fitne&s;s of the thing, unmindful of the opinion of the Pre&s;ident. An opinion of the chief magi&s;trate of the Union, was to a diploma|tic agent an authority and a guide, which he could not ju&s;tifiably have di&s;regarded.&mdash;The claim of compen&s;ation on the other &s;ide was greatly fortified by that opinion. Nor was it a matter of in|difference to our national delicacy and dignity, that the expectation given by it &s;hould be fulfilled.&mdash;It would have been indecent in our Envoy to have re&s;i&s;ted it. It was proper in him, by acceding to it, to refer the matter to the ultimate deci&s;ion of that authority, which by our con&s;titution is charged with the power of making treaties. It was the more proper, becau&s;e the thing was intrin&s;ically right. Every candid man, every good citizen, will rejoice that the Pre&s;ident
<PB N="96" REF="028795_0096_0FDD1CAF0D88A150">
acted as he did in the fir&s;t in&s;tance&mdash;that our envoy acted as he did in the &s;econd, and that the conduct of both has received the final con&s;titutional &s;anction.</P>
<P>The opinions of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, when they can be turned to the di&s;|credit of the treaty are with its adver&s;aries oracular truths&mdash; When they are to &s;upport it, they lo&s;e all their weight. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pre|&s;umption that the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter referred to had the concurrence of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> judg|ment of that officer, re&s;ults from a fact generally under&s;tood and be|lieved, namely, that the proceedings of the Pre&s;ident, at the period when it was written in relation to the war, were conformable with the unanimous advice of the heads of the executive departments.</P>
<P>This ca&s;e of Briti&s;h property captured by privateers originally arm|ed in our ports, fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ifies the a&s;&s;ertion of the adver&s;aries of the treaty, that all the preten&s;ions of Great-Britain have been fully provided for. She had a colourable ground to claim compen&s;ation for <HI>all captures</HI> made by ve&s;&s;els armed in our ports, whither&s;oever carried or how&s;oever di&s;po&s;ed of, e&s;pecially where the equ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pment had been to|lerated by our government. This toleration was to be inferred, as well from a forbearance to &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els when they came within our power, as from an original permi&s;&s;ion. Had compen&s;ation been &s;tipulated on this &s;cale, it is not certain that it would not have amoun|ted to as much more than that which has been promi&s;ed, as would counterbalance our claims for negroes carried away, and for the de|tention of the po&s;ts. But, in&s;tead of this, it is narrowed down by the treaty to &s;uch prizes of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els as were brought within our ports, and in re&s;pect to which we fore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to u&s;e all the means in our power for re&s;titution. Here, then, is a &s;et off again&s;t doubtful and que&s;tionable claims relinqui&s;hed on our &s;ide.

<P>Let us proceed for the pre&s;ent to the 9th article.</P>
<P>This article agrees that Briti&s;h &s;ubjects who <HI>now hold</HI> lands in the territories of the United States, and American citizens who now hold lands in the dominions of his Britannic maje&s;ty, &s;hall continue to hold them, according to the nature and tenure of their re&s;pecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e e&s;tates and titles therein; and may grant, &s;ell, or devi&s;e the &s;ame to whom they plea&s;e, in like manner as if they were natives; and that neither they nor their heirs or a&s;&s;igns, &s;o far as may re&s;pect the &s;aid lands, and the legal remedies incident thereto, &s;hall be regarded as aliens.</P>
<P>The mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of this article, which was fir&s;t u&s;hered into public view, in a very incorrect and in&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious &s;hape, and was con|ceived to amount to the grant of an indefinite and permanent right to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects to hold lands in the United States, did more it is believed to excite prejudices again&s;t the treaty than any thing that is really contained in it. And yet when truly under&s;tood, it is found to be nothing more than a confirmation of tho&s;e rights to lands, which, prior to the treaty, the laws of the &s;everal &s;tates allowed Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects to hold; with this incon&s;iderable addition, that the heirs and a&s;&s;igns of tho&s;e per&s;ons, though aliens, may hold the &s;ame lands: but no right whatever is given to lands of which our laws did not permit and legali&s;e the acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>The&s;e propo&s;itions will now be elucidated.</P>
<P>The term, HOLD, in the legal code of G. Britain, and of the&s;e &s;tates, has the &s;ame, &amp; that a preci&s;e technical &s;en&s;e. It imports a capacity legally and rightfully to have and enjoy real e&s;tate, and is contra-di&s;tingui&s;hed from the mere capacity of taking or purcha&s;ing, which is &s;ometimes applicable to the acqui&s;ition of a thing, that is forfeited by the very act of acqui&s;ition. Thus an alien may take real e&s;tate by purcha&s;e, but he cannot hold it. <HI>Holding</HI> is &s;ynonimous with <HI>Te|nure</HI> which in the feudal &s;y&s;tem implies <HI>fealty,</HI> of which an alien is incapable. Land, therefore, is forfeited to the government the in|&s;tant it pa&s;&s;es to an alien. The Roman law nullifies the contract en|tirely, &s;o that nothing pa&s;&s;es by the grant of land to an alien:&mdash;but our law, derived from that of England, permits the land to pa&s;s for the purpo&s;e of forfeiure to the &s;tate. This is not the ca&s;e with re|gard to de&s;cent, becau&s;e the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion there, being an act of law, and the alien being di&s;qualified to hold, the law con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, ca&s;ts no e&s;tate upon him.</P>
<P>The following legal authorities, &s;elected from an infinite number of &s;imilar ones, e&s;ttabli&s;h the above po&s;itions, viz. Coke on Littleton, p. 2.3. "Some men have capacity to <HI>purcha&s;e</HI> but <HI>no</HI> ability to <HI>hold.</HI> Some capacity to <HI>purcha&s;e,</HI> and ability to <HI>hold</HI> or not to <HI>hold,</HI> at the election of them&s;elves and others. Some capacity to <HI>take</HI> and <HI>hold.</HI>&mdash;Some neither capacity to <HI>take</HI> nor to <HI>hold.</HI> And &s;ome are &s;pecially di&s;abled to <HI>take</HI> &s;ome particular thing. If an alien chri&s;tian or infidel purcha&s;e hou&s;es, lands, tenements, or hereditaments, to him and his heirs, albeit he can have no heirs, yet he is of capacity to <HI>take</HI> a fee &s;imple, but not to <HI>hold.</HI>" The &s;ame, p. 8. "If a man,
<PB N="98" REF="028795_0098_0FDD4A51514C11F0">
&s;eized of lands in fee, hath i&s;&s;ue an alien, he cannot be heir <HI>pro|per defectum &s;ubjectiouis.</HI>" Black&s;tone's Commentaries, book III. chap. xviii. &sect; 2, "Alienation to an alien is a cau&s;e of forfeiture to the crown of the lands &s;o alienated, not only on account of his inca|pacity to <HI>hold</HI> them, but likewi&s;e on account of his pre&s;umption in attempting by an act of his own to acquire real property." Idem, chap. xix. &sect; 1. "The ca&s;e of an alien born, is al&s;o peculiar, for he may <HI>purcha&s;e</HI> a thing, but after purcha&s;e he can <HI>hold</HI> nothing, except a lea&s;e for years of a hou&s;e for the convenience of merchandize."</P>
<P>Thus it is evident, that by the laws of England, which it will not be denied, agree in principle with ours, an alien may <HI>take,</HI> but can|not <HI>hold</HI> lands.</P>
<P>It is equally clear, the laws of both countries, agreeing in this particular, that the word <HI>hold</HI> u&s;ed in the article under con&s;ideration, mu&s;t be under&s;tood according to tho&s;e laws, and therefore can only apply to tho&s;e ca&s;es in which there was a legal capacity to <HI>hold,</HI> in other words, tho&s;e in which our laws &amp; tho&s;e of Great Britain permitted the &s;ubjects &amp; citizens of the two parties to hold lands in the territories of each other. Some of the&s;e ca&s;es exi&s;ted prior to the treaty of peace, and where confi&s;cations had not taken place, there has never been a doubt that the property was effectually protected by that treaty. Others have ari&s;en &s;ince that treaty under &s;pecial &s;tatutes, of particu|lar &s;tates. Whether there are any others depending on principles of common law, need not be enquired into here, &s;ince the late treaty will neither &s;trengthen nor impair the operation of tho&s;e prin|ciples.</P>
<P>Whatever lands, therefore, may have been purcha&s;ed by any Bri|ti&s;h &s;ubject &s;ince the treaty of peace, which the laws of the &s;tate wherein they were purcha&s;ed did not permit him to acquire and hold, are entirely out of the protection of the article under con&s;ider|ation; the purcha&s;e will not avail him; the forfeiture which was incurred by it is &s;till in full force. As to tho&s;e lands which the laws of a &s;tate allowed him to purcha&s;e and hold, he owes his title to them, not to the treaty.</P>
<P>Let us recur to the words of the article, "Briti&s;h &s;ubjects who <HI>now hold</HI> lands, &s;hall continue to <HI>hold</HI> them <HI>according to the nature and tenure of their re&s;pective e&s;tates and titles therein.</HI>" But it has been &s;een, that to hold lands is to own them in a legal and competent capacity, and that an alien has no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch capacity. The lands, there|fore, which by rea&s;on of the alienage of a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, he could not, prior to the treaty, leg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lly purcha&s;e and hold&mdash;he cannot under the treaty continue to hold. As if it was de&s;igned to render this conclu&s;ion palpable, the provi&s;ion goes on to &s;ay, "<HI>According to the nature and tenure of their re&s;pective &s;tates and titles therein.</HI>" This is equivalent to &s;aying they &s;hall continue to hold as they before held. If they had no valid e&s;tate or title before, they will of cour&s;e continue to have none. The expre&s;&s;ions neither give any new, nor enlarge any old e&s;tate.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding clau&s;es relate only to de&s;cents or alienation of the land originally legally holden. Here the di&s;ability of alienage is taken away from the heirs and a&s;&s;&s;igns of the primitive proprie|tors. While this will conduce to private ju&s;tice, by enabling the families and friends of the individuals to enjoy their property by
<PB N="99" REF="028795_0099_0FDD4A82A31D2E78">
de&s;cent or devi&s;e, which it is pre&s;umable, was the main object of the provi&s;ion, there is no con&s;ideration of national policy that weighs again&s;t it. If we admit the whole force of the argument, which oppo&s;es the expediency of permitting aliens to hold lands (and con|cerning which I &s;hall barely remark here that it is contrary to the practice of &s;everal of the States, and to a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">actice from which &s;ome of them have hitherto derived material advantages) the extent to which the principle is affected by the pre&s;ent Treaty, is too limited to be felt; and in the rapid mutations of property, it will every day dimi|ni&s;h. Every alienation of a parcel of the privileged land to a citizen of the United States, will, as to that land, by interrupting the chain, put an end to the future operation of the privilege; and the lap&s;e of no great number of years may be expected to make an entire revo|lution in the property, &s;o as to dive&s;t the whole of privilege.</P>
<P>To manife&s;t the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the loud and virulent clamour, which was rai&s;ed again&s;t this article, it has been ob&s;erved by the friends of the in&s;trument, that our treaty with France not only grants a much larger privi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ege to the citizens of France, but goes the full length of removing univer&s;ally and perpetually from them the di&s;ability of alieni&s;m, as to the owner&s;hip of lands. This po&s;ition has been flatly denied by &s;ome of the writers on the other &s;ide Decius, in particular, after taking pains to &s;hew that it is erroneous; that the terms, "Goods moveable and immoveable," in the article of our treaty with France, mean only chattels real and per&s;onal in the &s;en&s;e of our law, and exclude a right to the freehold and inheritance of lands, triumphantly plumes him&s;elf on a detection of the fallacy of the writer of certain "Candid Remarks on the Treaty," who gave the interpretation above &s;tated to that article.</P>
<P>The error of Decius' interpretation, proceeds from a mi&s;under|&s;tanding of the term Goods in the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation of the article, to which he annexes the meaning a&s;&s;igned to that term in our law, in|&s;tead of re&s;orting as he ought to have done, to the French laws, for the true meaning of the corre&s;pondent term biens, which is that u&s;ed in the French original. Goods, in our law, no doubt mean chattel intere&s;ts; but goods, or "biens," in the French law, mean all kinds of property, real as well as per&s;onal. It is equivalent to, and derived from, the term "bona" in the Roman law, an&s;wering mo&s;t nearly to "e&s;tates," in our law, and embracing inheritances in land, corporeal and incorporeal hereditaments, as well as property in moveable things. When it is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h one &s;pecies from another, it is done by an adjective; <HI>biens meubles et immeubles,</HI>" an|&s;wering to <HI>bona</HI> or <HI>res mobilia, et immobilia,</HI> things moveable and immoveable, e&s;tates real and per&s;onal.

In our treaty with France they are tran&s;lated goods; but it is evidently a great mi&s;take to under|&s;tand the expre&s;&s;ion in the limited &s;en&s;e of our law. Being a mere word of tran&s;lation, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood according to the meaning of the French text: for it is declared in the conclu&s;ion of the trea|ty, that it was originally compo&s;ed and concluded in the French Tongue. Moreover, the term goods, when u&s;ed in our langu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge, as the equivalent of the term bona, or biens, is always under&s;tood in the large &s;en&s;e of the original term, in other words, as comprehending real and per&s;onal e&s;tate, inheritances as well as chattel intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Having now e&s;tabli&s;hed the true meaning of the terms, "goods, moveable and immoveable," let us proceed with this guide to a review of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e article.</P>
<P>Its fir&s;t and principal feature is, "that the &s;ubjects and inhabitants of the United States, or any of them, &s;hall not be reputed Aubains in France. This is the &s;ame as if it had been &s;aid, "they &s;hall not be reputed Aliens." For the definition of Aubains, as given in the work before fir&s;t cited, is this, "Aubains are per&s;ons not born un|der the dominion of the King;" the exact equivalent of the defi+nition of Alien in the Engli&s;h law. If our citizens are not to be re+puted Aliens in France, it follows, that they mu&s;t be exempted from alien di&s;abilities, and mu&s;t have the &s;ame rights with natives, as to acquiring, conveying, and &s;ucceeding to real and other e&s;tate. Accor|dingly the article, having pronunced that our citizens &s;hall not be reputed aliens in France, proceeds to draw certain con&s;equences. The fir&s;t is, that they &s;hall not be &s;ubject to the droit d'aubaine. The droit d'aubaine was under the monarchy, one of the regalia; it was the right of the prince to &s;ucceed to all e&s;tates or property &s;ituate in the kingdom, belonging to foreigners, who died without legiti|mate children born in the kingdom.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved, that the laws of France permitted foreigners to acquire and hold even real e&s;tates, &s;ubject to this right of the &s;o|vereign, in ca&s;e of demi&s;e without i&s;&s;ue born under his allegiance. But this right of the &s;overeign, as to American citizens, is abroga|ted by the treaty; &s;o that their legal repre&s;entatives, wherever born, may &s;ucceed to all the property, real or per&s;onal, which they may have acquired in France.</P>
<P>And in conformity with this, it is further declared, that they may by te&s;tament, donation or otherwi&s;e, di&s;po&s;e of their goods, move|able and immoveable (that is, as we have &s;een, their e&s;tates, real and per&s;onal) in favour of &s;uch per&s;ons as to them &s;hall appear good, and that their heirs, &s;ubjects of the United States, whether re&s;iding in France or el&s;ewhere, may &s;ucceed to them, ab inte&s;tato, without be|ing obliged to obtain letters of naturalization.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the &s;tipulations on the part of France; and they a+mount to a removal from the citizens of the United States of alien di&s;abilities in that country, as to property. I &s;ay as to property, becau&s;e as to civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical employments, it &s;eems to have
<PB N="102" REF="028795_0102_0FDD4A5433352568">
been a principle of the French law, that the incapacity of foreigners could only be removed by &s;pecial di&s;pen&s;ations, directed to the parti|cular object.</P>
<P>What are the correlative &s;tipulations on the part of the United States? They are in the&s;e terms "the &s;ubjects of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King &s;hall enjoy on their part, in all the dominions of the &s;aid States, an entire and perfect reciprocity relative to the &s;tipulations contained in this article. But it is at the &s;ame time agreed, that its contents &s;hall not affect the laws made or that may be made hereafter in France again&s;t emigrations, which &s;hall remain in all their force and vigour, and the United States on their part, or any of them &s;hall be at liberty to enact &s;uch laws relative to that matter as to them &s;hall appear proper."</P>
<P>Since then the article removes from our citizens the di&s;abilities of aliens as to property in France, and &s;tipulates for her citizens, an entire and perf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ct reciprocity in the United States, it follows, that Frenchmen are equally exempt in the United States from the like di&s;a|bilities. &mdash;They may, therefore, hold, &s;ucceed to, and di&s;po&s;e of real e&s;tates.</P>
<P>It appears, that the &s;en&s;e both of the French and of the American go|vernment, has corre&s;ponded with this con&s;truction.</P>
<P>In the year 1786, the Marqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Bellegarde, and the Chevalier Mazie|re, &s;ons of the two &s;i&s;ters of Gen. Ogelthorpe, repre&s;ented to the Count de Vergennes, the French mini&s;ter for foreign affairs, that they met with impediments to their claims from the laws of Georgia pro|hibiting aliens to hold lands. Mr. De Vergennes communicated their complaint to Mr. Jeffer&s;on, our then mini&s;ter in France, ob&s;erving that the alien di&s;abilities of the complainants having in common with tho&s;e of all Frenchmen, been removed by the treaty between the two countries, they ought to experience no impediment on that account, in the &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce&s;&s;ion, to the e&s;tate of their uncle, and that the in|terfering laws of Georgia ought to be repealed &s;o as to agree with the treaty.</P>
<P>Mr. Je&s;ter&s;on, in reply, &s;tates the ca&s;e of the complainants, pro|ving that they were prec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ded from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion for other rea&s;ons than that of alieni&s;m; and then adds, that the treaty with France having placed the &s;ubjects of France in the United States on a footing with natives, as to conveyances &amp; de&s;cents of property, there is no nece&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y for the a&s;&s;emblies to pa&s;s laws on the &s;ubject, the treaty be|ing a law, as he conceives, &s;uperior to tho&s;e of particular a&s;&s;emblies, and repealing them when they &s;tand in the way of its operation.</P>

<P>The fixing the true &s;en&s;e of the article in the treaty with Great-Britain is alone a refutation of mo&s;t of the objections which have been made to it, by &s;hewing, that they apply not to what really exi&s;ts, but to a quite different thing. It may be u&s;eful, however, to pa&s;s them briefly in review with &s;ome cur&s;ory remarks.</P>
<P>The article, it is &s;aid, infringes the rights of the &s;tates, and im|pairs the obligation of private contracts, permits aliens to hold real e&s;tates again&s;t the fundamental policy of our laws, and at the hazard

of introducing a dangerous foreign influence; is unequal, becau&s;e no American has been hardy enough &s;ince the peace to purcha&s;e land in England, while millions of acres have been purcha&s;ed by Briti&s;h &s;ub|jects in our country with knowledge of the ri&s;k&mdash;is not warranted by the example of any other treaty we have made? for if even, that with France &s;hould contain a &s;imilar provi&s;ion (which is denied) &s;till the difference of circum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tances would make it an in appo&s;ite prece|dent &s;ince this was a treaty made flagrante bello, in a &s;ituation which ju&s;tified &s;acrifices.</P>
<P>The&s;e objections have been formally made and explicitly urged. One writer, afraid of ri&s;king a direct a&s;&s;ertion, but infidiou&s;ly en|deavouring to in&s;inuate mi&s;conception, contents him&s;elf with putting a que&s;tion. What, &s;ays he, will be the effect of this article as to the revival of the claims of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, traitors or exiles?</P>
<P>As to the infraction of the rights of the States, this it is pre&s;umed, mu&s;t relate to the depriving them of forfeitures of alien property. But as the article gives no right to a Briti&s;h &s;ubject to hold any lands which the laws of a &s;tate did not previou&s;ly authori&s;e him to hold &mdash;it prevents no forfeiture to which he was &s;ubject by them, and con&s;equently deprives no &s;tate of the benefit of any &s;uch forfeiture. With regard to e&s;cheats for want of qualified heirs, it depended on every proprietor to avoid them by alienation to citizens.</P>
<P>As to impairing the obligation of private contracts, it is difficult to under&s;tand what is meant. Since land, purcha&s;ed by an alien, pa&s;|&s;es from the former proprietor, and becomes forfeited to the &s;tate, can it be afterwards the &s;ubject of a valid private contract? If the effect of the artic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e was to confirm a defective title derived from the alien, how could this impair <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he obligation of any other private con|tract concerning it? But whatever may be intended, it is enough to &s;ay, that the article does not confirm the title to any land which was not before good. So that the ground of the objection fails.</P>
<P>As to permitting aliens to hold land contrary to the policy of our laws, it has been &s;hewn, that on a true con&s;truction, it only applies to the very limited ca&s;e of the alien heirs and a&s;&s;igns of per&s;ons who before right fully he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d lands, and is confined to the identical lands &s;o previou&s;ly holden. that its greate&s;t effect mu&s;t be in&s;ignificant, and that this effect will continually decrea&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the millions of acres &s;aid to have been purcha&s;ed by Briti&s;h &s;ubjects &s;ince the peace, it has been &s;hewn that if by the laws of the States in which the purcha&s;es were made, they were illegally ac|quired, they &s;till remain in the &s;ituation in which they were before the treaty.</P>
<P>As to there being no precedent of a &s;imilar &s;tipulation with any other country; it has been proved that with France we have one much broader. The idea that this was a &s;acrifice to the nece&s;&s;ity of our &s;ituation, flagrante bello, is new. Are we then to under&s;tand that we are in this in&s;tance gave to France, as the price of her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, a privilege in our country which leads to the introduction of a foreign influence, dangerous to our independence and pro&s;perity! For to this re&s;ult tends the argument concerning the policy of the exclu&s;ion of aliens. Or is it that no privilege granted to France can be dan|gerous?</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are not orthodox enough to adopt this la&s;t po&s;ition,
<PB N="104" REF="028795_0104_0FDD4A55DE00D110">
may neverthele&s;s tranquilize them&s;elves about the con&s;equences. This is not the channel through which a dangerous foreign influence can a&s;&s;ail us. Notwith&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid, it may per|haps bear a &s;erious argument, whether the permi&s;&s;ion to foreigners to hold lands in our country, might not, by the operation of private intere&s;t, give us more influence upon foreign countries, than they will ever acquire upon us from the holding of tho&s;e lands&punc; Be this as it may, could we not appeal to &s;ome good patriots, as they &s;tire them|&s;elves by way of eminence, for the truth of the ob&s;ervation, that fo|reign governments have more direct and powerful means of influ|ence than can ever re&s;ult from the right in que&s;tion?</P>
<P>Moreover, there was a peculiar rea&s;on for the provi&s;ion which has been made in our la&s;t treaty, not applicable to any treaty with another country. The former relative &s;ituation of the United States and Great Britain led to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of lands by the citizens of each in the re&s;pective territories. It was natural and ju&s;t to &s;ecure by treaty their free tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion to the heirs and a&s;&s;igns of the parties.</P>
<P>As to the revival of the claims of traitors or exiles; if property con|fi&s;cated and taken away, is property holden by tho&s;e who have been deprived of it, then may there be ground for alarm on this &s;core. How painful is it to behold &s;uch gro&s;s attempts to deceive a whole people on &s;o momentous a que&s;tion? How <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cting, that impo&s;ture and fraud &s;hould be &s;o often able to a&s;&s;ume with &s;ucce&s;s the garb of patri|oti&s;m!

<P>IT is provided by the 10th art. of the treaty, that "neither debts due from individuals of the one nation, to individuals of the other, nor &s;hares, nor monies, which they may have in the public funds, or in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ublic or private banks, &s;hall ever in any event of war, or national differences, be &s;eque&s;tered or confi&s;ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d, it being unju&s;t and impolitic that debts and engagements, contracted and made by individuals, having confidence in each other and in their re&s;pective goverments, &s;hould ever be de&s;troyed or impaired by national autho|rity on account of national differences and di&s;contents."</P>
<P>The virulence with which this article has been attacked, cannot fail to excite very painful &s;en&s;ations in every mind duly impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;anctity of public faith, and with the importance of national credit and character; at the &s;ame time that it furni&s;hes the mo&s;t cogent rea&s;ons to de&s;ire, that the pre&s;ervation of peace may obviate the pre|text and the temptation to fully the honour, and wound the intere&s;ts of the country, by a mea&s;ure which the truly enlightened of every nation would condemn.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, without re&s;erve, that in proportion to the vehe|mence of the oppo&s;ition again&s;t this part of the treaty, is the &s;atis|faction I derive from its exi&s;tence, as an ob&s;tacle the more to the per|petration of a thing, which, in my opinion, be&s;ides deeply injuring

In my view, every moral and every political &s;en|timent unite to con&s;ign it to execration.</P>
<P>Neither will I di&s;&s;emble, that the dread of the effects of the &s;pirit which patronizes that idea, has ever been with me one of the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive arguments for a pacific policy on the part of the United States. Serious as the evil of war has appeared at the pre&s;ent &s;tage of our affairs, the manner in which it was to be apprehended it might be carried on, was &s;till more formidable, in my eyes, than the thing it|&s;elf. It was to be feared, that in the fermentation of certain wild op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nions, tho&s;e wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and temperate maxims, which will forever con&s;titute the true &s;ecurity and felic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty of a &s;tate, would be over-ruled, and that a war upon credit, eventually upon property and upon the general principles of public order, might aggravate and embitter the ordinary calamities of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reign war.

<P>THE objects protected by the 10th article, are cla&s;&s;ed under four heads:&mdash;1. Debts of individuals to individuals&mdash;2. Property of individuals in the public funds&mdash;3. Property of individuals in pub|lic banks.&mdash;4. Property of individuals in private banks. The&s;e, if anali&s;ed, re&s;olve them&s;elves, in principle, into two di&s;criminations, viz. private debts and private property in public funds. The cha|racter of private property prevails throughout.&mdash;No property of either government is protected from confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration by the other. This la&s;t circum&s;tance merits attention, becau&s;e it marks the true boundary.</P>
<P>The propriety of the &s;tipulation will be examined under the&s;e &s;everal a&s;pects: the right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;trate private debts or private property in public funds, on the ground of rea&s;on and principle&mdash;the right as depending on the opinion of juri&s;ts and on u&s;age&mdash;the policy and expediency of the practice&mdash;the analogy of the &s;tipulation with &s;tipulations in our other treaties and in treaties between other nations.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, as to the right on the ground of rea&s;on and principle.</P>
<P>The general propo&s;ition on which it is &s;upported, is this, "That every individual of a nation, with whom we are at war, where&s;oever he may be, is our enemy, and his property of every kind in every place, liable to capture by right of war."</P>
<P>The only exception to this rule, re&s;pects property within the juri&s;diction of a Neutral State, but the exemption is referred to the right of the neutral nation, not to any privilege which the &s;itua|tion gives to the enemy proprietor.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on, if con&s;ulted, will &s;ugge&s;t another exception&mdash;This regards all <HI>&s;uch property as the laws of a country permit foreigners to acquire within it or to bring into it.</HI> The right of holding or having property in a country, always implies a duty on the part of its government
<PB N="109" REF="028795_0109_0FDD4A8C2FCD6958">
to protect that property, and to &s;ecure to the owner the full enjoyment of it. When ever, therefore, a government grants permi&s;&s;ion to foreigners to acquire property within its territories, or to bring and depo&s;it it there, it tacitly promi&s;es protection and &s;ecurity. It mu&s;t be under&s;tood to engage, that the foreign proprietor, as to what he &s;hall have acquired or depo&s;ited, &s;hall enjoy the rights, privileges, and immunities of a native proprietor, without any other exceptions than tho&s;e which the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws may have previou&s;ly declared. How can any thing el&s;e be under&s;tood? Every &s;tate, when it has entered into no contrary engagement, is free to permit or not to permit foreigners to acquire or bring property within its ju|ri&s;diction, but if it grant the right, what is there to make the tenure of the foreigner different from that of the native, if antecedent laws have not pronounced a difference?&mdash;Property as it exi&s;ts in civilized &s;ociety, if not a creature of, is at lea&s;t regulated and defined by, the laws. They pre&s;cribe the manner in which it &s;hall be u&s;ed, alienated, or tran&s;mitted; the conditions upon which it may be held, pre|&s;erved, or forfeited. It is to them we are to look for its rights, li|mitations and conditions. No condition of enjoyment, no cau&s;e of forfeiture, which they have not &s;pecified, can be pre&s;umed to exi&s;t.&mdash; An extraordinary di&s;cretion to re&s;ume or take away the thing with|out any per&s;onal fault of the proprietor, is incon&s;i&s;tent with the notion of property. This &s;eems always to imply a contract between the &s;ociety and the individual; that he &s;hall retain and be pro|tected in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and u&s;e of his property &s;o long as he &s;hall ob&s;erve and perform the conditions which the laws have annexed to the tenure. It is neither natural nor equitable to con&s;ider him as &s;ubject to be deprived of it for a cau&s;e foreign to him&s;elf; &s;till le&s;s for one which may depend on the volition or plea&s;ure, even of the very government to who&s;e protection it has been confided: for the propo&s;ition, which affirms the right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter, does not di&s;tingui&s;h between offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive war; between a war of ambition on the part of the power, which exerci&s;es the right, or a war of &s;elf pre&s;ervation again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of another.</P>
<P>The property of a foreigner placed in another country, by per|mi&s;&s;ion of its laws, may ju&s;tly be regarded as a depo&s;it, of which the &s;ociety is the tru&s;tee. How can it be reconciled with the idea of a tru&s;t, to take the property from its owner, when he has per&s;onally given no cau&s;e for the deprivation.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e two families in a &s;tate of nature, and that a member of one of them had by permi&s;&s;ion of the head of the other, placed in his cu&s;tody &s;ome article belonging to him&s;elf, and &s;uppo&s;e a quarrel to en&s;ue between the two heads of families in which the member had not participated by his immediate councilor con&s;ent, would not natural equity declare the &s;eizure and confi&s;cation of the depo&s;i|ted property to be an act of perfidious rapacity?</P>
<P>Again, &s;uppo&s;e two neighbouring nations, which had not had intercour&s;e with each other, and that one of them opens its ports and territories for the purpo&s;e of commerce to the citizens of the other, proclaiming free and &s;afe ingre&s;s and egre&s;s; &s;uppo&s;e afterwards a war to break out between the two nations and the one which had granted that permi&s;&s;ion, to &s;eize and convert to its own u&s;e the goods and credits of the merchants of the other, within its dominions.

<P>Moreover the property of foreigners within our country may be regarded as having paid a valuable con&s;ideration for its protection and exemption from forfeiture; that wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch is brought in, commonly enriches the revenue by a duty of entry.

<P>The principle of the propo&s;ition gives an equal right to &s;ubject the per&s;on as the property of a foreigner to the rigours of war. But what &s;hould be thought of a government, which &s;hould &s;eize all the &s;ubjects of its enemy found within its territory, and commit them to durance, as pri&s;oners of war? would not all agree that it had violated an a&s;ylum which ought to have been &s;acred?

<PB N="111" REF="028795_0111_0FDD4A8D3A980000">
would it not be equally reprehen&s;ible to violate the a&s;ylum which had been given to the property of tho&s;e foreigners? Rea&s;on, left to its own lights, would determine all the&s;e que&s;tions in one way, and &s;everely condemn the mole&s;tation, on account of a national con|te&s;t, as well of the property as the per&s;on of the foreigner found in our country, under the licence and guarantee of the laws of pre|vious amity.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of property in the public funds, is &s;till &s;tronger than that of private debts. To all the &s;anctions which apply to the latter, adds that of an expre&s;s pledge of the public faith to the foreign holder of &s;tock.</P>
<P>The con&s;tituting of a public debt or fund, transferable without limitation or di&s;tinction, amounts to a promi&s;e to all the world, that whoever, foreigner or citizen, may acquire a title to it, &s;hall enjoy the benefit of what is &s;tipulated. Every transferee becomes by the act of transfer, the immediate proprietor of the promi&s;e. It inures directly to his u&s;e, and the foreign promi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, no more than the native, can be deprived of that benefit, except in con&s;equence of &s;ome act of his own, without the infraction of a po&s;itive engage|ment.</P>
<P>Public debt has been truly defined, "A property &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the faith of government." Its e&s;&s;ence is promi&s;e. To confi&s;cate or &s;e|que&s;ter it, is emphatically to re&s;cind the promi&s;e given, to revoke the faith plighted; it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;eparate the two ideas of a breach of faith, and the confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration of a property &s;ub&s;i&s;ting only in the faith of the government by which it is made.</P>
<P>When it is con&s;idered, that the promi&s;e made to the foreigner is not made to him in the capacity of member of another &s;ociety, but in that of citizen of the world, or of an individual in a &s;tate of na|ture &mdash;the infraction of it towards him, on account of the fault real or pretended of the &s;ociety to which he belongs, is the more obviou&s;ly de&s;titute of colour. There is no real affinity between the motive and the con&s;equence. There is a confounding of relations. The obligation of a contract can only be avoided by the breach of a condi|tion expre&s;s or implied, which appears or can be pre&s;umed to have been within the contemplation of both parties, or by the per&s;onal fault or crime of him to whom it is to be performed. Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that a citizen of one country would lend his money to the govern|ment of another, in the expectation that a war between the two countries, which without or again&s;t his will, might break out the next day, could be deemed a &s;ufficient cau&s;e of forfeiture?</P>

<P>THE point next to be examined is, the right of confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration, as depending on the opinion of juri&s;ts and on u&s;age.</P>
<P>To under&s;tand how far the&s;e ought to weigh, it is requi&s;ite to con&s;ider what are the elements or ingredients which compo&s;e what is called the law of nations.</P>
<P>The con&s;tituent parts of this &s;y&s;tem are, 1. The nece&s;&s;ary or inter|nal law, which is the law of nature applied to nations; or that &s;y&s;tem of rules for regulating the conduct of nation to nation, which rea&s;on deduces from the principles of natural right, as relative to poli|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cal &s;ocieties or &s;tates. 2. The voluntary law, which is a &s;y&s;tem of rules re&s;ulting from the ineqality and independence of nations, and which, in the admini&s;tration of their affairs, and the pur&s;uit of their pretentions, proceeding on the principle of their having no com|mon judge up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n earth, attributes equal validity, as to external ef|fects, to the mea&s;ures or conduct of one as of another, without re|gard, to the intrin&s;ic ju&s;tice of tho&s;e mea&s;ures or that conduct. Thus captures in war are as valid when made by the party in the wrong, as by he party in the right.&mdash;3. The pactitious, or conventional
<PB N="113" REF="028795_0113_0FDD4A8ECE083190">
law, or that law which re&s;ults from a treaty between two or more nations. This is evidently, a particular, not a general law, &s;ince a treaty on pact can only bind the contracting parties: Yet when we find a provi&s;ion univer&s;ally pervading the treaties between nations for a length of time, as a kind of formula, it is high evidence of the general law of nations. 4. The cu&s;tomary law, which con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e rules of conduct that in practice are re&s;pected and ob&s;erved among nations: Its authority depends on u&s;age implying a tacit con|&s;ent and agreement. This al&s;o, is a particular, not a general law, obligatory only on tho&s;e nations who&s;e acquie&s;cence has appeared, or from circum&s;tances may fairly be pre&s;umed. Thus the cu&s;tomary law of Europe may not be that of a different quarter of the globe. The three la&s;t branches are &s;ometimes aggregately denominated the po&s;itive law of nations</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t are di&s;coverable by rea&s;on; the two la&s;t depend on proof, as matter of fact. Hence the opinion of juri&s;ts, though weighing as the &s;entiments of judicious or learned men who have made the &s;ubject a particular &s;tudy, are not conclu&s;ive as authorities &mdash;In regard to the nece&s;&s;ary and voluntary law, e&s;pecially, they may be freely di&s;regarded, unle&s;s they are found to be adopted and &s;anc|tioned by the practice of nations: For where REASON is the guide, it cannot properly be renounced for mere OPINION, however re|&s;pectable. As witne&s;&s;es of the cu&s;tomary law, their te&s;timony, the re&s;ult of careful re&s;earches, is more particularly entitled to attention.</P>
<P>If, then, it has been &s;atisfactorily proved as the dictate of &s;ound rea&s;on, that private debts and private property in public funds are not ju&s;tly liable to confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration, an oppo&s;ite opinion of one or more juri&s;ts could not controul the conclu&s;ion in point of principle. So far as it may atte&s;t a practice of nations, which may have introduced a po&s;itive law on the &s;ubject, the con&s;ide|ration may be different. It will remain to examine, upon their own and other te&s;timony, whether that practice be &s;o general as to be capable of varying a rule of rea&s;on, by the force of u&s;age; and whe|ther it &s;till continues to bear the &s;ame character, or has been weaken|ed or done away by more recent or modern u&s;age.</P>
<P>I will not avail my&s;elf of a po&s;ition advanced by writers, that u&s;age, if derogating from the principles of natural ju&s;tice, is null, further than to draw this inference, that a rule of right, deducible from them, cannot be deemed to be altered by an u&s;age partial, contra|dicted, fluctuating.</P>
<P>With the&s;e guides, our futher enquiries will &s;erve to confirm us in the negative of the pretended right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;trate in the ca&s;es &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The notion of this right is evidently derived from the ROMAN law. It is &s;een there in this peculiar form, "Tho&s;e things of an enemy which are among us, belong not to the &s;tate but to the fir&s;t occu|pant,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dige&s;t xii. chap. 1. "Eaquae res ho&s;tiles apud nos, &amp;c."</NOTE>" which &s;eems to mean, that the things of an enemy, at the commencement of the war, found in our country, may be &s;eized by any citizen, and will belong to him who fir&s;t gets po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It is known that the maxims of the Roman law are exten&s;ively incorporated

into the different codes of Europe;&mdash;and particularly that the writers on the law of nations, have borrowed l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">berally from them,&mdash; This &s;ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> notion does not &s;tamp it with much authority.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of Rome proves, that war and conque&s;t were the great bu&s;ine&s;s of that pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ple, and that, for the mo&s;t part, commerce was little cul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ivated.

Indeed the world was yet too young&mdash;moral &s;cience too much in its cradle&mdash;to render the Ro|man juri&s;prudence a proper model for implicit imitation: accord|ingly, in this very particular of the rights of war, it &s;eems to have been equally a rule of the Roman law, "That tho&s;e who go into a foreign country in time of peace, if war is &s;uddenly kindled, are made the &s;laves of tho&s;e amo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g whom, now become enemies by ill fortune, they are apprehended."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In pace quae pervenerunt ad alteros &s;i belium &s;ubita exerci&s;&s;et, corum &s;ervi officientur, apud quos j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m ho&s;tes &s;uo &s;ato de preben|dantur Dige&s;t lib. xlix. tit. 15. l. 12.</NOTE></P>

Thus it would &s;eem, that in the principle of the Roman law, we might rightfully kill a foreigner, who had come into our country during peace and was there at the breaking out of a war with his country&mdash;Can there be a po&s;ition more horrible, more dete&s;table?</P>
<P>The improvement of mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l &s;cience in modern times, re&s;trains the right of killing an enemy to the time of battle or re&s;i&s;tance, except by way of puni&s;hment for &s;ome enormous breach of the laws of na|tions, or for &s;elf pre&s;ervation in ca&s;e of immediate and urgent dan|ger, and reject altogether the right of impo&s;ing &s;lavery on captives.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould there have been a he&s;itation to reject other odious con|&s;equences of &s;o exceptionable a principle?&mdash;What re&s;pect is due to maxims which have &s;o inhuman a foundation?</P>
<P>And yet a deference for tho&s;e maxims has milled writers who have profe&s;&s;edly undertaken to teach the principles of national e|thics and the &s;pirit of rapine has continued to a late period to con&s;e|crate the relies of ancient barbari&s;m with too many precedents of imitation.

<P>Turning from the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ients to the moderns, we find that the learned Grotius quotes and adopts as the ba&s;is of his opinions, the rules of the Roman law, though he in &s;everal particular<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, qualifies them by the humane innovations of later times.</P>
<P>On the very que&s;tion of the right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter private debts, his opinion, as far as it appears, &s;eems to be at variance with his premi&s;es, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eering a kind of middle cour&s;e. His expre&s;&s;ions (L.III.C.XX. Sec. XVI.) are the&s;e, "Tho&s;e debts which are due to pri|vate per&s;ons, at the beginning of the war, are not to be accounted

His idea appears from this pa&s;&s;age to be, that the right of war is limited to the arre&s;ting of the pay|ment of private debts during its continuance, and not to the confi&s;|cation or annihilation of the debt.&mdash;Nor is it clear whether he means that this are&s;tation is to be produced by a &s;pecial act of pro|hibition, or by the operation of &s;ome rule of law which denies to an alien enemy a right of action. This feeble and hetergeneous opinion may be conceived to have proceeded from a conflict between a re|&s;pect for ancient maxims and the impre&s;&s;ion of more enlightened views, inculcated by the principles of commerce and civilization.</P>
<P>Bynker&s;hoeck is more con&s;i&s;tent&mdash;Adopting with Grotius, the rule of the Roman law in its full rigor, he is not frightened at the con&s;e|quences, but follows them throughout. Hence he be&s;tows a chapter upon the defence of the propo&s;ition, quoted in a former number (to wit) that<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Qae&s;tionum Juris Public, lib. i. c&middot; 7. "Cum ea &s;it belli condi|tio ut ho&s;tes &s;int omni jure &s;poliati pro&s;criptique rationis e&s;t qua&s;cun|que res ho&s;ticum apud ho&s;tes, inventas, dominum mutare et Fi&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> cedere."</NOTE> "Since it is the condition of war, that enemies may with full right be de&s;poiled and pro&s;cribed, it is rea&s;onable that what|&s;oever things of an enemy are found among his enemies, &s;hould change their owner and go to the trea&s;ury," and in &s;everal places he expre&s;sly applies the rule to <HI>things in action,</HI> or debts and credits, as well as to things in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In confirmation of his doctrine, he adduces a variety of examples which embrace a period of &s;omething more than a century beginning in the year 1556, and ending in the year 1667, and which compre|hend as actors on the principle he e&s;pou&s;es, France, Spain, the States General, Denmark, the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hops of Cologne and Mun&s;ter. But he acknowledges that the right has been que&s;tioned, and notes parti|cularly that when the king of France and the Bi&s;hops of Mun&s;ter and Cologne in the year 1673 confi&s;cated the debts which their &s;ubjects owed to the confederate Belgians, the States General, by an edict of the 6th of July of that year, cen&s;ured the proceeding and decreed that tho&s;e debts could not be paid but to the true creditors, and that the exaction of them whether by force or with con&s;ent, was not to be e&s;teemed valid.</P>
<P>If from the great pains which appear to have been taken by this learned writer to collect examples in proof of his doctrine, we are to conclude that the collection is tolerably complete, we are warranted in drawing this inference, that he has not cured any defect, which rea&s;on may di&s;cern in his principle, by any thing like the evidence of &s;uch a general uniform and continued u&s;age as is requi&s;ite to intro|duce <HI>a rule</HI> of the po&s;itive law of nations, in derogation from the na|tural.</P>
<P>A minority only of the powers of Europe are &s;hewn to have been implicated in the practice, and among the majority not included, are &s;everal of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and re&s;pectable. One of the&s;e, Great Britain, is repre&s;ented as having acquie&s;ced in it in the trea|ties

The &s;ugge&s;tion of an in&s;tance in the pre&s;ent war with France will here|after be examined. In &s;uch a que&s;tion, the practice of a nation which has for ages figured pre-eminently in the commercial world, is en|titled to particular notice.</P>
<P>It is not unworthy of remark, that the common law of England, from its earlie&s;t dawnings, contradicted the rule of the Roman law. It exempted from &s;eizure, by a &s;ubject of England, the property of a foreigner brought there before a war, but gave to the fir&s;t &s;eizer, or occupant, the property which came thereafter the breaking out of the war. The noble principles of the common law, cannot cea&s;e to engage our re&s;pect, while we have before our eyes &s;o many monu|ments of their excellence in our own juri&s;prudence.</P>
<P>It al&s;o merits to be dwelt upon, that the United Netherlands, for &s;ometime the fir&s;t, and long only the &s;econd in commercial con|&s;equence, formerly di&s;puted the right, and condemned the practice of confi&s;cating private debts, though them&s;elves, in &s;ome in&s;tances, guilty of it.</P>
<P>And it is likewi&s;e a material circum&s;tance, that Byncker&s;hock, who &s;eems to have written in the year 1737, does not adduce any precedent later than the year 1667, 70 years before his publication.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;equent period will, it is believed, be found, upon &s;trict en|quiry, equally barren of &s;imilar precedents.&mdash;The exceptions are &s;o few,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The ca&s;e of Pru&s;&s;ia and the Sile&s;ia Loan is the only one I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound.</NOTE> that we may fairly a&s;&s;ert, that there is the negative u&s;age of near a century and an half again&s;t the pretended right. This negative u&s;age of a period, the mo&s;t enlightened as well as the mo&s;t com|mercial in the annals of the world, is of the highe&s;t authority. The former u&s;age, as being partial and with numerous exceptions, was in&s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h a rule. The contrary u&s;age, or the renuncia|tion of the former u&s;age, as being general, as attended with few or no exceptions, is &s;ufficient even to work a change in the rigour of an ancient rule, if it could be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been e&s;tabli&s;hed. Much more is it &s;ufficient to confirm and enforce the le&s;&s;on of rea&s;on and to di&s;&s;ipate the clouds which error, and &s;ome &s;cattered in&s;tances of violence and rapine, may have produced.</P>
<P>Of the theoretical writers, whom I had an opportunity of con|&s;ulting, Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">el is the only remaining one, who directly treats the point. His opinion has been &s;aid to favour the right to confi&s;cate and &s;eque&s;ter. But when carefully analized, it will add to the proofs of the levity with which the oppo&s;ers of the treaty make a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="028795_0117_0FDD4A91C96A9560">After &s;tating, among other things, that "war gives the &s;ame right over any &s;um of money, due by a neutral nation to our enemy, as it can give over his other goods;" he proceeds thus, "When Alexan|der, by conque&s;t, became ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of Thebes, he remitted to the The&s;&s;alians, an hundred talents, which they owed to the Thebans. The &s;overeign has naturally the &s;ame right over what his &s;ubjects may be indebted to his enemies, therefore he may confi&s;cate debts of this nature, if the term of payment happen in the time of war, or at lea&s;t he may prohibit his &s;ubjects paying while the war la&s;ts. But at pre&s;ent, in regard to the advantage and &s;afety of commerce, all the &s;overeigns of Europe have departed from this ri|gour. And as this cu&s;tom has been generally received, he who &s;hould act contrary to it, would injure the public faith; for &s;trang|ers tru&s;ted his &s;ubjects, only from a firm per&s;ua&s;ion, that the general cu&s;tom would be ob&s;erved. The &s;tate does not &s;o much as touch the &s;ums which it owes to the enemy.

<P>The fir&s;t propo&s;ition of the above pa&s;&s;age amounts to this, that a "&s;overeign naturally, that is according to the law of nature, may confi&s;cate debts which his &s;ubjects owe to his enemies, if the term of payment happen in the time of war, or at lea&s;t he may pro|hibit his &s;ubjects from paying while the war la&s;ts."</P>
<P>So far as this goes, it agrees with the principle which I combat, that there is a natural right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter private debts in time of war: &s;o far Vatel accords with the Roman law and with Bynker&s;hoek.</P>
<P>But he annexes a whim&s;ical limitation "If the term of payment happen in the time of war"&mdash;and there is a marked uncertainty and he&s;itation&mdash;the &s;overeign "may confi&s;cate, or at lea&s;t he may prohibit his &s;ubjects from paying while the war la&s;ts"&mdash;'Tis evident that the circum&s;tance of the time of payment can have no influence upon the right. If it reaches to confi&s;cation, which takes away the &s;ub&s;tance of the thing, the mere incident of the happening of payment mu&s;t be immaterial. If it is confined to the arre&s;ting of payment during the war, the rea&s;on of the rule, the object being to prevent &s;upplies going to the enemy, will apply it as well to debts which be|come payable before the war, as to tho&s;e which became payable in the war. Whence this inaccuracy in &s;o accurate a thinker?

<P>But while Vatel thus countenances in the fir&s;t part of the pa&s;|&s;age the opinion, that the natural law of nations authori&s;es the confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration of private debts, in what immediately follows, he mo&s;t explicitly and unequivocally informs us, that the rule of that law in this re&s;pect has been derogated from by modern u&s;age or cu&s;tom&mdash;in other words, that the modern cu&s;tomary law has changed in this particular the ancient natural law.&mdash;Let his own

words be con&s;ulted&mdash;At pre&s;ent (&s;ays he) in regard to the advantage and &s;afety of commerce, all the &s;overeigns of Europe have departed from this rigour&mdash;And as this cu&s;tom has been generally received, he who would act contrary to it would injure the public faith; for &s;trangers tru&s;ted his &s;ubjects only from the firm per&s;ua&s;ion that the general cu&s;tom would be ob&s;erved."</P>
<P>The te&s;timony is full, that there is a GENERAL CUSTOM received and adopted by all the &s;overeigns of Europe, which obviates the rigour of the ancient rule; the non ob&s;ervance of which cu&s;tom would violate the public faith of a nation&mdash;as being a breach of an implied contract, by the virtue of the cu&s;tom, upon the &s;trength of which foreigners tru&s;t his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Language cannot expre&s;s more clearly a rule of the cu&s;tomary law of nations, the e&s;&s;ence of which, we have &s;een, is general u&s;age, implying a tacit agreement to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onform to the rule&mdash;The one cited is denominated a CUSTOM generally received a GENERAL CUSTOM; all the &s;overeigns of Europe are &s;tated to be parties to it, and it is repre&s;ented as obligatory on the public faith, &s;ince this would be in|jured by a departure from it.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence is, that if the right pretended did exi&s;t by the natural law, it has given way to the cu&s;tomary law, for it is a con|tradiction to call that a right which cannot be exerci&s;ed without breach of faith. The re&s;ult is, that by the pre&s;ent cu&s;tomary law of nations, within the &s;phere of its action, there is no right to con|fi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter private debts in time of war, The rea&s;on or motive of which law is the advantage and &s;afety of commerce.</P>
<P>As to private property in public funds, the right to meddle with them is &s;till more emphatically negatived. "The &s;tate does not <HI>&s;o much as touch</HI> the &s;ums it owes to the enemy. <HI>Every where</HI> in ca&s;e of war, funds credited to the public are exempt from confi&s;|cation and SEIZURE."

<P>In another place the author gives the rea&s;on of this po&s;ition, book ii. chap. xviii. "In repri&s;als, the goods of a &s;ubject are &s;eized in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e of the &s;tate or the &s;overeign.

Thus it is u&s;ual to behave in France, England, and el&s;ewhere, with re&s;pect to the money which foreign|ers have placed in the public funds." The &s;ame principle, if he had reflected without bias, would have taught him, that repri&s;als could rightfully extend to nothing that had been committed with their permi&s;&s;ion, to the cu&s;tody and guardian&s;hip of our laws, during a &s;tate of peace; and con&s;equently, that no property of our enemy, which was in our country before the breaking out of the war, is ju&s;tlyfiable to them.

private debts? Why not trace it to the natural inju&s;tice and per|fidy of taking away in war, what a foreigner is permitted to own and have among us in peace? Why ever have con&s;idered, that as a natural right which was contrary to good faith tacitly pledged? This is evidently the effect of too much deference to ferocious maxims or antiquity, of undue complai&s;ance to &s;ome precedents of modern rapacity.</P>
<P>He had avoided the error, by weighing maturely the con&s;equen|ces of his own principle in another ca&s;e: "He who declares war, &s;ays he, does not confi&s;cate the <HI>immoveable</HI> goods po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in his country by his enemy's &s;ubjects: <HI>in permitting them to purcha&s;e and po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e goods,</HI> he has in this re&s;pect admitted them into the num|ber of his &s;ubjects," that is, he has admitted them to a like privilege with his &s;ubjects, as to the real property they were permitted to acquire and hold. But, why &s;hould a le&s;s privilege attend the li|cen&s;e to purcha&s;e. po&s;&s;e&s;s or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e other kinds of property in his country? The rea&s;on, which is the permi&s;&s;ion of the &s;overeign, mu&s;t extend to the protection of one kind of property as well as another, if the permi&s;&s;ion extends to both.</P>
<P>Vate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> advances in this and in the pa&s;&s;age quoted immediately before it, the true principles which ought to govern the que&s;tion, tho' he does not pur&s;ue them in their con&s;equences; el&s;e he would not have deduced the exemption of private debts, from confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration, from the cu&s;tomary law of nations, but would have traced it to the natural or nece&s;&s;ary law; as founded upon the obligations of good faith; upon the tacit promi&s;e of &s;ecurity con|nected with the permi&s;&s;ion, to acquire property within or bring pro|perty into our country; upon the protection which every govern|ment owes to a property of which it legalizes the acqui&s;ition, or the depo&s;it within its juri&s;diction: and in the ca&s;e of <HI>immoveable</HI> goods or real e&s;tate, of which he admits a right to &s;eque&s;ter the <HI>income,</HI> to pre|vent its being remitted to the enemy, he would have perceived the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of leaving this effect to be produced by the ob&s;tructions in|trin&s;ically incident to a &s;tate of war; &s;ince there is no rea&s;on why the income &s;hould be le&s;s privileged than the &s;ub&s;tance of the thing.</P>
<P>It appears then, that the doctrine of Vatel, collectively taken, amounts to this, that there is a natural right of war in certain ca&s;es to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter an enemy's property found within our coun|try; but that, on motives relative to commerce and public credit, the cu&s;tomary law of Europe has re&s;trained that right as to <HI>private debts,</HI> and <HI>private property</HI> in public funds. His opinion, therefore, favours the principle of the article of the treaty under examination, as con&s;onant with the pre&s;ent European law of nations&mdash;and it is an opinion of greater weight than any that can be cited; as well on account of the capacity, diligence, information and the preci&s;ion of ideas, which characteri&s;e the work in which it is contained, as on account of the recency of that work<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appears to have been written about the year <HI>1760.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

<P>There is one more authority which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all cite in reference to a part of the que&s;tion; property in the public funds. It is a report to the Briti&s;h King in the year 1753, from Sir George Lee, Judge of the prerogative court, Dr. Paul, Advocate General in the courts of civil law. Sir Dudley Rider, and Mr. Murray, Attorney and Solicitor General<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir George L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was afterwards the very celebrated Chief Ju&s;tice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and Mr. Murray was the late Lord Mansfield.</NOTE>, on the &s;ubject of the Sile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ia loan, &s;eque&s;trated by the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, by way of repri&s;al, for the capture and con|demnation of &s;ome Pru&s;&s;ian ve&s;&s;els. This report merits all the re|&s;pect which can be derived from con&s;ummate knowledge and ability in the reporters; but it would lo&s;e much of its weight from the want of impartiality, which might fairly be imputed to the officers of one of the governments intere&s;ted in the conte&s;t, had it not &s;ince received the confirming eulogies of impartial and celebrated foreign writers. Among the&s;e, Vatel calls it an excellent piece on the law of nations.</P>
<P>The following is an extract:&mdash;"The King of Pru&s;&s;ia has pledged his royal word to pay the Sile&s;ia debt to <HI>private men.</HI> It is negoti|able, and many parts of it have been a&s;&s;igned to the &s;ubjects of other powers.

<P>This ca&s;e of the Sile&s;ia debt is the only example within the pre|&s;ent century, prior to the exi&s;ting war, which I have been able to trace, violating the immunity of private debts or private property, in public funds. It is a precedent that can have little weight not only from its &s;ingularity, but from the character of its author. Frede|rick was a con&s;ummate General, a profound &s;tate&s;man; but he was very far from being a &s;evere morali&s;t. This is not the only in&s;tance in which he tarni&s;hed his faith, and the friends of his fame mu&s;t regret that he could not plead on this occa&s;ion tho&s;e mighty and daz|zling rea&s;ons of &s;tate, which are the &s;pecious apologies for his other aberr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tions.</P>
<P>It is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erted, that the pre&s;ent war of Europe affords examples of the practice, which I reprobate, and that Great Britain her&s;elf has given one. The pre&s;ent war of Europe is of &s;o extraordinary a com|plexion, and has been conducted in all re&s;pects, upon &s;uch extraor|dinary principles, that it may truly be regarded as an exception to all general rules, as a precedent for nothing. It is rather a beacon, warning mankind to &s;hun the pernicious example, than a model inviting to imitation. The human pa&s;&s;ions, on all &s;ides, appear to have been wrought up to a pitch of frenzy, which has &s;et rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, and humanity, at defiance.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have neverthele&s;s thought fit to appeal to the exam|ple of this very anomalous war, have not detailed to us the pre|ci&s;e nature or cour&s;e of the tran&s;actions to which they refer, nor do I know that &s;ufficient documents have appeared in this country to gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de us in the enquiry.</P>
<P>The imperfect evidence which has fallen under my ob&s;ervation re|&s;pects France and Great Britain, and &s;eems to exhibit the&s;e facts.</P>
<P>France pa&s;&s;ed a decree &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">que&s;tering the property of the &s;ubjects of the powers at war with her, and in the &s;ame or another de|cree obliged all tho&s;e of her citizens, who had mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies owing to them in foreign countries, to draw bills upon their debtors, and to furni&s;h tho&s;e bills to the government by way of loan, or upon certain terms of payment.</P>
<P>The government of Great Britain, in con&s;equence of this proceed|ing, pa&s;&s;ed two different acts, the objects of which were to prevent the payment of tho&s;e bills, and to &s;ecure the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ums due for the bene|fit of the original creditors. The&s;e acts appoint certain commi&s;|&s;ioners to whom reports are to be made of all French property in the hands of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and who are empowered to receive and &s;ell goods and other effects&mdash;to collect debts, and to depo&s;it the proceeds in the bank of London, or in other &s;afe keeping if prefer|red or required by parties intere&s;ted. The monies depo&s;ited are to be inve&s;ted in the purcha&s;e of public &s;tock, together with the in|tere&s;t or dividends ari&s;ing from time to time, to be eventually ac|counted for to the proprietors. The commi&s;&s;ioners have likewi&s;e
<PB N="122" REF="028795_0122_0FDD4A6A1EDDDB00">
a di&s;cretion, upon demand, to deliver over their effects and monies to &s;uch of the proprietors as do not re&s;ide within the French do|minions.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not enter into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the propriety of the&s;e acts of Great Britain.&mdash;It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that they are attended with circum&s;tances which very e&s;&s;entially di&s;criminate them from the thing for which they are quoted. The act of the French govern|ment was in &s;ub&s;tance a compul&s;ory a&s;&s;umption of all the property of its citizens in foreign countries This extraordinary mea&s;ure pre&s;ented two options to the governments of the&s;e countries.&mdash;One to con&s;ider the transfer as virtu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lly effected, and to confi&s;cate the property as being no longer that of the individuals, but that of the government of France&mdash;the other to defeat the effect of her plan by tying up the property for the benefit of the original creditors, in exclu&s;ion of the drafts which they were compelled to draw. Great Britain appears to have elected the latter cour&s;e. If we &s;uppo&s;e her &s;incere in the motive, and there is fairne&s;s and fidelity in the execution, the i&s;&s;ue will be favourable rather than detrimen|tal to the rights of private property.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that there was an option to confi&s;cate. A govern|ment may rightfully confi&s;cate the property of an adver&s;ary govern|ment. No principle of ju&s;tice or policy occurs to forbid repri&s;als upon the public or national property of an enemy. That ca&s;e is foreign in every view to the principles which protect private pro|perty. The exemption &s;tipulated by the 10th article of the treaty is accordingly re&s;tricted to the latter.</P>
<P>It appears that the government of France convinced by the effect of the experiment, that the &s;eque&s;tration of the property of the &s;ub|jects of her enemies was impolitic, thought fit to re&s;cind it.&mdash;Hence, on the 19th of December 1794, the Convention decreed as follows:</P>
<P>"The decree concerning the &s;eque&s;tration of the property of the &s;ubjects of ho&s;tile powers is annulled. Such &s;ums as have been paid by French citizens into the Trea&s;ury in con&s;equence of tho&s;e de|crees will be reimbur&s;ed."</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the debates upon this decree, it was declared, that the decrees which it was to repeal, <HI>had prepared the ruin of com|merce,</HI> and had &s;evered, <HI>again&s;t the right of nations,</HI> the obligations of merchants in different &s;tates. This is a direct admi&s;&s;ion that the &s;eque&s;tration was contrary to the law of nations.</P>
<P>As far as re&s;pects France, then, the precedent upon the whole is a &s;trong condemnation of the pretended right to confi&s;cate or &s;e|que&s;ter.</P>
<P>This formal renunciation of the ground, which was at fir&s;t taken, is a very emphatical prote&s;t again&s;t the principle of the mea&s;ure It ought to &s;erve us too as an in&s;tructive warning again&s;t the em|ployment of &s;o mi&s;chievous and di&s;graceful an expedient. And as to England, as has been &s;hewn, the precedent is foreign to the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Thus we perceive that <HI>opinion</HI> and <HI>u&s;age,</HI> far from &s;upporting the right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter private property, on account of rational wars, when referred to the <HI>modern</HI> &s;tandard, turn again&s;t that right and coincide with the principle of the article of treaty un|der examination.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="028795_0123_0FDD4A99D95DE968">What remains to be offered will farther illu&s;trate its propriety, and reconcile it to all reflecting men.</P>

<P>SINCE the clo&s;ing of my la&s;t number I have accidentally turned to a pa&s;&s;age of VATEL, which is &s;o pertinent to the immediate &s;ub|ject of that paper that I cannot refrain from interrupting the progre&s;s the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion to quote it; it is in the&s;e words (b. 3. ch. 4. &s;ect. 63) "The &s;overeign declaring war, can neither detain tho&s;e <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> of the enemy who are within his dominions at the time of the decla|ration, <HI>nor their effects.</HI> They came in his country on the public faith. By permitting them to enter his territories and continue there, he tacitly promi&s;ed them liberty, and &s;ecurity for their re|turn." This pa&s;&s;age contains, explicitly, the principle which is the general ba&s;is of my argument, namely, that the permi&s;&s;ion to a foreigner to come with his effects into, and acquire others within, our coun|try, in time of peace virtually pledges the public faith for the &s;e|curity of his per&s;on and property in the event of war. How can this be reconciled with the natural right (controuled only by the cu&s;tomary law of nations) which this writer admits, to confi&s;cate the debts due by the &s;ubjects of a &s;tate to its enemies? I a&s;k once more, can there be a natural right to do that which includes a violation of faith?</P>
<P>It is plain to a demon&s;tration, that the rule laid down in this pa&s;|&s;age, which is &s;o ju&s;t and per&s;picuous as to &s;peak conviction to the heart and under&s;tanding, unites the natural with the cu&s;tomary law of nations, in a condemnation of the preten&s;ion to confi&s;cate or &s;e|que&s;ter the private property of our enemy found in our country at the breaking out of a war.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to examine the policy and expediency of &s;uch a preten&s;ion.</P>
<P>In this inve&s;tigation I &s;hall a&s;&s;ume, as a ba&s;is of argument, the fol|lowing po&s;ition, <HI>That it is advantageous to nations to have commerce with each other.</HI></P>
<P>Commerce it is manife&s;t, like any other object of enterprize or in|du&s;try, will pro&s;per in proportion as it is &s;ecure. Its &s;ecurity, con|&s;equently promoting its pro&s;perity extends its advantages. Security is indeed e&s;&s;ential to its having a due and regular cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The preten&s;ion of a right to confi&s;cate or &s;eque&s;ter the effects of foreign merchants in the ca&s;e in que&s;tion, is in its principele fatal to that nece&s;&s;ary &s;ecurity. Its free exerci&s;e would de&s;troy external com|merce; or, which is nearly the &s;ame thing, reduce it within the con|tracted limits of a game of hazard, where the chance of large pro|fits, accompanied by great ri&s;ks would tempt alone the adven|turous and the de&s;perate. Tho&s;e enterprizes, which from circui|tous or long voyage, flowne&s;s of &s;ales, incident to the nature of cer|tain
<PB N="124" REF="028795_0124_0FDD4A6B817801D0">
commodities, the nece&s;&s;ity of credit, or from other cau&s;es, demand con&s;iderable time for their completion, mu&s;t be renounced&punc; Credit indeed mu&s;t be bani&s;hed from all operations of foreign com|merce; an engine, the importance of which to its vigorous and &s;uc|ce&s;sful pro&s;ecution will be doubted by none, who will be guided by experience or ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>It cannot need amplification to elucidate the truth of the&s;e po&s;itions. The &s;torms of war occur &s;o &s;uddenly and &s;o often, as to forbid the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the merchants of one country would tru&s;t their property to any extent, or for any duration in another country, which was in the practice of confi&s;cating or &s;eque&s;trating the effects of its enemies found within its territories at the commencement of a war.</P>
<P>That practice therefore would nece&s;&s;arily paralize and wither the commerce of the country in which it obtained. Accordingly, nations attentive to the cultivation of commerce which were betray|ed by temporary con&s;iderations into particular in&s;tances of that atro|cious practice, have been led by the experience of its mi&s;chiefs, to ab&s;tain from it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n later times. They &s;aw that to have per&s;i&s;ted in it, would have been to abandon competition on equal terms, in the lucrative and beneficial field of commerce.</P>
<P>It is no an&s;wer to this to &s;ay, that the exerci&s;e of the right might be ordinarily &s;u&s;pended, though the right it&s;elf might be maintained for extraordinary and great emergencies.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, as the ordinary forbearance of its exerci&s;e would be taken by foreigners for evidence of an intention never to exer|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e it, by which they would be enticed into large depo&s;its that would not otherwi&s;e have taken place; a departure from the general cour&s;e would always involve an act of treachery and cruelty.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place; the po&s;&s;ibility of the occa&s;ional exerci&s;e of &s;uch a right, if conceived to exi&s;t, would at lea&s;t be a &s;low poi&s;on, con|ducing to a &s;ickly habit of commerce; and in a &s;eries of time would be productive of much more evil than could be counterbalanced by any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ood which it might be po&s;&s;ible to obtain in the contemplated emergency, by the u&s;e of the expedient.</P>
<P>Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> experience decide&mdash;Examples of confi&s;cation and &s;eque&s;tra|tion have been given&mdash;When did the dread of them prevent a war? when did it cripple an enemy, &s;o as to di&s;able him from exertion, or forced him into a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the views of his adver&s;ary? When did it even &s;en&s;ibly con&s;pire to either of the&s;e ends? If it has ever had any &s;uch effect, the evidence of it has not come within my knowledge.</P>
<P>It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rue, that as between Great Britain and the United States, the expectation of &s;uch effects is better warranted than perhaps in any other ca&s;es that have exi&s;ted, becau&s;e we commonly owe a larger debt to that country, than is u&s;ual between nations, and there is a re|lative &s;tate of things, which tends to a continuation of this &s;ituation.</P>
<P>But how has the matter operated hitherto? In the late war be|tween the two countries, certain &s;tates confi&s;cated the debts due from their citizens to Briti&s;h creditors, and the&s;e creditors actually &s;uffered great lo&s;&s;es&mdash;The Briti&s;h cabinet mu&s;t have known that it
<PB N="125" REF="028795_0125_0FDD4A9AD918BE60">
was not impo&s;&s;ible the &s;ame thing might happen in another war, and on a more general &s;cale: yet the appearances were extremely &s;trong, at a particular juncture, that it was their plan, either from ill-will, from the belief that popular opinion would ultimately drag our government into the war, from the union of the&s;e two, or from other cau&s;es to force us into ho&s;tilities with them. Hence the ap|prehen&s;ion of acts of confi&s;cation, or &s;eque&s;tration, was not &s;ufficient to deter from ho&s;tile views, or to in&s;ure pacific di&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>It may be pretended, that the menace of this mea&s;ure had a re&s;train|ing influence on the &s;ub&s;equent conduct of Great Britain. But if we a&s;cribe nothing to the mea&s;ures which government actually pur&s;ued under the pre&s;&s;ure of the provocations received, we at lea&s;t find, in the cour&s;e of European events, a better &s;olution of a change of policy in the cabinet of Great Britain, than from the dread of a legi&s;lative piracy on the debts due their merchants.</P>
<P>The truth unfortunately is, that the pa&s;&s;ions of men &s;tifle calcula|tion, that nations the mo&s;t attentive to pecuniary con&s;iderations ea&s;ily &s;urrender them to ambition, to jealou&s;y, to anger, or to revenge.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the actual experiment of an exerci&s;e of the pretended right, by way of repri&s;al for an injury complained of, would commonly be as inefficacious, as the menace of it, to arre&s;t general ho&s;tilities. Pride is rou&s;ed&mdash;re&s;entment kindled; and where there i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> even no previous di&s;po&s;ition to tho&s;e ho&s;tilities, the probability is, that they follow. Nations, like individuals, ill brook the idea of re|ceding from their preten&s;ions under the rod, or of admitting the ju&s;tice of an act of retaliation or repri&s;al, by &s;ubmitting to it. Thus we learn from the king of Pru&s;&s;ia him&s;elf, that the &s;eque&s;|tration of the Sile&s;ia debt, in&s;tead of procuring the re&s;toration for which it was de&s;igned, was on the point of occa&s;ioning an open rup|ture between him and Great-Britain, when the &s;upervention of a quarrel with France diverted the &s;torm, by rendering him nece&s;|&s;ary as an ally.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be imagined, that the practice of confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration would be more efficacious to wound and di&s;able Great-Britain, in ca&s;e of war, than to prevent it&mdash;But this al&s;o, is a vain chimera! A nation, that can at plea&s;ure rai&s;e by loan, twenty mil|lions &s;terling, would be in little danger of being di&s;concerted or en|feebled in her military enterprizes, by the taking away or arre&s;ting of three or four millions due to her merchants. Did it produce di&s;|tre&s;s and di&s;order among tho&s;e whom it affected and their connec|ions? If that di&s;order was &s;ufficient to threaten a general derangement of mercantile credit, and with it of the public finances, the pending war affords an example, that the public pur&s;e or credit could be brought &s;ucce&s;sfully into action for the &s;upport of the &s;ufferers. Three or four millions of exchequer bills applied in loans, would be like|ly to &s;uffice to prevent the partial evil from growing into a national calamity.</P>
<P>But we forget, that as far as the interruption of the payment of the debts due to her merchants could be &s;uppo&s;ed to operate upon Great-Britain, war it&s;elf would e&s;&s;entially an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration&mdash;By interrupting trade &amp; intercour&s;e, it
<PB N="126" REF="028795_0126_0FDD4A6CF5489060">
is in fact, in a great degree a virtual &s;eque&s;tration. Remittances to any extent become impracticable. There are few ways in which, on account of the &s;tate of war, it is lawful to make them; and debtors are for the mo&s;t part enough di&s;po&s;ed to embrace pretexts of pro|cra&s;tination.</P>
<P>The inconvenience of deferred payment would, therefore, be felt by Great-Britain, with little mitigation from the bare exi&s;tence of war; without the nece&s;&s;ity of our government incurring the di&s;|credit and re&s;pon&s;ibility of a &s;pecial interference.</P>
<P>Indeed, as far as dread of eventual lo&s;s can operate, it ought, in a great mea&s;ure to have its effect exclu&s;ive of the idea of confi&s;|cation. Great-Britain mu&s;t want reflection not to be &s;en&s;ible, that in making war upon us, &s;he makes war upon her own merchants; by the depredations upon our trade de&s;troying tho&s;e re&s;ources from which they are to be paid. If &s;he be indifferent to this con&s;i|deration, it will be becau&s;e &s;he is governed by &s;ome motive or pa&s;&s;ion powerful enough to di&s;po&s;e her to run the ri&s;k of the entire lo&s;s&mdash; in the reliance of obtaining indemnification, by the acqui&s;itions of war, or in the terms of peace.</P>
<P>Will it be &s;aid, that the &s;eizure of the debts would put into the hands of our government a valuable re&s;ource for carrying on the war?&mdash; This upon trial would prove as fallacious as all the re&s;t. Various inducements would prevent debtors from paying into the trea&s;ury.&mdash; Some would decline it from con&s;cientious &s;cruples, from a doubt of the rectitude of the thing&mdash;others with intent to make a merit with their creditors of the concealment, and to favour their own future credit and advantage&mdash;others from a de&s;ire to retain the money in their own employment, and a great number from the apprehen&s;ion that the treaty of peace might revive their re&s;pon&s;ibility to the cre|ditors, with the embarra&s;&s;ment to them&s;elves of getting back, as well as they could, the monies which they had paid into the trea&s;ury. Of this, our la&s;t treaty of peace, in the opinion of able judges, gave an example. The&s;e cau&s;es and others, which do not as readily occur, would oppo&s;e great ob&s;tacles to the execution of the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But &s;evere laws, inflicting heavy penalties might compel it&mdash;Ex|perience does not warrant a &s;anguine reliance upon this expedient, in a ca&s;e in which great opportunity of concealment is united with &s;trong motives of inclination or intere&s;t&mdash;It would require an inqui|&s;ition, ju&s;tly intolerable to a free people&mdash;penalties which would con|found the due proportion between crime and puni&s;hment, to de|tect or deter from concealment and eva&s;ion, and to execute the law &mdash;Probably no means le&s;s efficacious than a <HI>revolutionary tribunal</HI> and a <HI>guillotine</HI> would go near to an&s;wer the end.&mdash;There are but few, I tru&s;t, to whom the&s;e would be welcome means.</P>
<P>We conclude, therefore, that the law would be evaded to an ex|tent, which would di&s;appoint the expectations from it as a re|&s;ource. Some monies no doubt would be collected but the proba|bility is, that the amount would be in&s;ignificant even in the &s;cale of a &s;ingle campaign.&mdash;But, &s;hould the collection prove as complete, as it ordinarily is, between debtor and creditor, it would little, if at all, exceed the expence of a campaign.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="028795_0127_0FDD4A9C34F2DEE0">Hence we perceive, that regarding the mea&s;ure, either as a mean of di&s;abling our enemies or as a re&s;ource to our&s;elves, its con&s;equence dwindles upon a clo&s;e &s;urvey; it cannot pretend to a magnitude, which would apologize, either for a &s;acrifice of national honour or candour, or for a deviation from the true principles of commerce and credit.</P>
<P>But let us take a further view of its di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>A nation, in ca&s;e of war, is under no re&s;pon&s;ibility for the de|linqencies or frauds of its citizens, who are debtors to tho&s;e of its enemy, if it does not &s;pecially interfere with the payment of the debts which they owe. But if it interpo&s;es its authority to prevent the payment, it gives a claim of indemnification to its adver&s;ary, for the intervening lo&s;&s;es which tho&s;e delinquencies or frauds may occa&s;ion. Whether, on the making of peace, this would be in&s;i&s;ted upon or waved, might depend much on the good or ill &s;ucce&s;s of the war; but every thing which adds to the catalogue of our ene|my's ju&s;t preten&s;ions, e&s;pecially when the fortune of war has been pretty equal, is an evil, either as an additional ob&s;tacle to &s;peedy peace, or as an ingredient to reader the terms of it le&s;s advantageous to our&s;elves. And it is therefore unwi&s;e in a government to increa&s;e the li&s;t of &s;uch preten&s;ions, by a mea&s;ure, which, without utility to it&s;elf, admini&s;ters to the indolence of negligent, and to the avidity fraudulent, individuals.</P>
<P>Further&mdash;Every &s;pecies of repri&s;al or annoyance, which a power at war; employs contrary to liberality or ju&s;tice, of doubtful pro|priety in the e&s;timation of the law of nations, departing from that moderation, which, in latter times, &s;erves to mitigate the &s;everities of war; by furni&s;hing a pretext or provocation to the other &s;ide, to re&s;ort to extremities, &s;erves to embitter the &s;pirit of ho&s;tili|ty, and to extend its ravages. War is then apt to become more &s;anguinary, more wa&s;ting, and every way more de&s;tructive. This is a ground of &s;erious reflection to every nation, both as it regards humanity and policy; to this country it pre&s;ents it&s;elf, accompanied with con&s;iderations of peculiar force. A va&s;tly extended &s;ea coa&s;t, over&s;pread with defencele&s;s towns, would offer an abundant prey to an incen&s;ed and malignant enemy, having the power to com|mand the &s;ea. The u&s;ages of modern war forbid ho&s;tilities of this kind; and though they are not always re&s;pected, yet, as they are never violated, unle&s;s by way of retaliation for a violation of them on the other &s;ide, without exciting the reprobation of the im|partial part of mankind, &s;ullying the glory, and bla&s;ting the reputa|tion of the party which di&s;regards them, this con&s;ideration has in general force &s;ufficient to induce an ob&s;ervance of them. But the confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration of private debts, or private pro|perty in public funds, now generally regarded as an odious and un|warrantable mea&s;ure, would, as between us and Great Britain, contain a poignant &s;ting. Its effect to exa&s;perate, in an extreme degree, both the nation and government of that country cannot be doubted. A di&s;po&s;ition to retaliate, is a natural con&s;equence; and it would not be difficult for us to be made to &s;uffer beyond any po&s;&s;ible degree of advantage to be derived from the occa&s;ion of the retaliation. It were
<PB N="128" REF="028795_0128_0FDD4A715C37B588">
much wi&s;er to leave the property of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects an untouched pledge for the moderation of its government, in the mode of pro&s;e|cuting the war.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides (as if requi&s;ite might be proved from the records of hi&s;tory) in national controver&s;ies, it is of real importance to conciliate the good opinion of mankind; and it is even u&s;eful to pre&s;erve or gain that of our enemy.&mdash;The latter facilitates accommodation and peace; the former attracts good offices, friendly interventions, &s;ometimes direct &s;upport from others. The exemplary conduct, is general, of our country, in our conte&s;t for independence, was probably not a little &s;ervicable to us this way; it &s;ecured to the intrin&s;ic goodne&s;s of our cau&s;e, every collateral advantage, and gave it a popularity among nations unalloyed and unimpaired, which even &s;tole into the cabinets of Princes. A contrary policy tends to contrary con&s;equences. Though nations, in the main, are govern|ed by what they &s;uppo&s;e their intere&s;t, he mu&s;t be imperfectly ver&s;ed in human nature, who thinks it indifferent whether the maxims of a &s;tate tend to excite kind or unkind di&s;po&s;itions in others, or who does not know that the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions may in&s;en&s;ibly mould or bias the views of &s;elf intere&s;t. This were to &s;uppo&s;e that rulers only rea|&s;on; do not feel; in other words, are not men.</P>
<P>Moreover the mea&s;ures of war ought ever to look forward to peace. The confi&s;cation of the private property of an enemy, mu&s;t always be a point of &s;erious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion when intere&s;t or nece&s;&s;ity leads to negociations for peace. Unle&s;s when ab&s;olutely pro&s;trate by the war, re&s;titution is likely to con&s;titute an ultimatum of the &s;uffer|ing party. It mu&s;t be agreed to, or the war protracted, and at la&s;t it is probable it mu&s;t &s;till be agreed to. Should a refu&s;al of re&s;titution prolong the war for only one year, the chance is, that more will be lo&s;t than was gained by the confi&s;cation. Should it be nece&s;&s;ary finally to make it, after prolonging the war, the di&s;advantage will preponderate in a ratio to the prolongation. Should it be, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, a&s;&s;ented to, what will have been gained? The tem|porary u&s;e of a fund of incon&s;iderable moment in the general i&s;&s;ue of the war, at the expence of ju&s;tice, character, credit, and per|haps of having &s;harpened the evils of war.</P>
<P>How infinitely preferable to have drawn an equal fund from our own re&s;ources, which with good management is always practicable!&mdash;If the re&s;titution includes damages, on account of the interference, for the failures of individuals, the loan will have been the mo&s;t co&s;tly that could have been made. It has been el&s;ewhere ob&s;erved, that our treaty of peace with Great Britain gives an example of re&s;titu|tion. The late one between France and Pru&s;&s;ia gives another; one which has &s;ince appeared between France and the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, gives another. This mu&s;t become every day more and more a matter of cour&s;e, becau&s;e the immunity of mercantile debts be|comes every day more and more important to trade, better under|&s;tood to be &s;o, and more clearly con&s;idered as enjoined by the prin|ciples of the law of nations.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee, that in reference to the &s;imple que&s;tion of war and peace, the mea&s;ure of confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration is marked with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ery feature of impolicy.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="028795_0129_0FDD4AA059799370">We have before &s;een that the preten&s;ion of a right to do the one or the other has a mo&s;t inimical a&s;pect towards commerce and cre|dit. Let us re&s;ume this view of the &s;ubject.&mdash;The credit, which our merchants have been able to obtain abroad e&s;&s;entially in Great Britain, has from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of our country to this day been the animating principle of our foreign commerce. This every mer|chant knows and feels; and every intelligent merchant is &s;en&s;ible that for many years to come the ca&s;e mu&s;t continue the &s;ame. This, in our &s;ituation, is a peculiar rea&s;on of the utmo&s;t force, for re|nouncing the preten&s;ion in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The exerci&s;e of it, or the &s;erious apprehen&s;ion of its exerci&s;e, would nece&s;&s;arily have one of two effects. It would deprive our merchants of the credit, &s;o important to them or it would oblige them to pay a premium for it proportioned to the opinion of the ri&s;k. Or to &s;peak more truly, it would combine the two effects; it would cramp credit, and &s;ubject what was given to a high pre|mium. The mo&s;t obvious and familiar principles of human action e&s;tabli&s;h, that the con&s;ideration for money or property, lent or credit|ed, is moderate or otherwi&s;e, according to the opinion of &s;ecurity or hazard, and that the quantity of either to be obtained, on loan or credit, is in a great degree contracted or enlarged by the &s;ame rule.</P>
<P>Thus &s;hould we, in the operations of our trade, pay exorbitantly for a preten&s;ion, which is of little value, or rather which is pernicious even in the relations to which its utility is referred. What folly to cheri&s;h it? How much greater the folly ever to think of exerci&s;ing it. It never can be exerci&s;ed hereafter in our coun-try, without great and la&s;ting mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of cheri&s;hing &s;o odious a preten&s;ion as "our be&s;t, our only weapon of defence"&mdash;Wi&s;dom admoni&s;hes us to be eager to ca&s;t it from us, as a weapon mo&s;t dangerous to the wearer, pro&s;cribed by the laws of nations, by the laws of honour, and by every principle of &s;ound policy.</P>
<P>Every merchant ought to de&s;ire that the mo&s;t perfect tranquil|lity on this point in foreign countries, &s;hould facilitate to him on the be&s;t and cheape&s;t terms the credit for which he has occa&s;ion. And every other citizen ought to de&s;ire, that he may be thus freed from a continual contribution in the enhanced price of every im|ported commodity he con&s;umes, towards defraying the premium which the want of that tranquillity is calculated to generate.</P>

<P>The&s;e particulars are &s;tated as evidence of the temper of the day, and of a policy, which then prevailed, to bottom our &s;y&s;tem with re|gard to foreign nations upon tho&s;e grounds of moderation and equity by which rea&s;on religion and philo&s;ophy had tempered the har&s;h maxims of more early times. It is painful to ob&s;erve an effort to make the public opinion, in this re&s;pect retrogade, and to infect our councils with a &s;pirit contrary to the&s;e &s;alutary advances towards improvement in true civilization and humanity.</P>
<P>If we pa&s;s from our own treaty to tho&s;e between other nations, we find that the provi&s;ions, which have been extracted from ours, have very nearly become formulas in the Conventions of Europe. As ex|amples of this may be con&s;ulted, the following articles of treaties be|tween Great-Britain and other powers (towit) the xvii. article of a treaty of peace and commerce with Portugal, in 1642; the xxxvi. article of a treaty of peace, commerce and alliance, with Spain, in 1667; the xix. article of a treaty of peace, and the ii. of a treaty of commerce with France both in 1713, and the xii. article of a treaty of commerce and navigation with Ru&s;&s;ia, in 1766.</P>
<P>The article with Portugal provides, that if difficulties and doubts &s;hall ari&s;e between the two nations, which give rea&s;on to <HI>apprehend</HI> the interruption of commerce <HI>public notice</HI> of it &s;hall be given to the &s;ubjects on both &s;ides, and after that notice, <HI>two years</HI> &s;hall be allowed to carry away their merchandizes and goods, and in
<PB N="133" REF="028795_0133_0FDD4AA30DD35A38">
the mean time there &s;hall be no injury or prejudice done to any per&s;ons or goods on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>The articles with France, in addition to the provi&s;ions common in other ca&s;es, particularly &s;tipulate, that during the term of the protection (&s;ix months) "&s;ubjects on each &s;ide &s;hall enjoy good and <HI>&s;peedy</HI> ju&s;tice, &s;o that during the &s;aid &s;pace of &s;ix months, they may be able to <HI>reco|ver</HI> their <HI>goods</HI> and <HI>effects</HI> entru&s;ted as well to the PUBLIC as to pri|vate per&s;ons."</P>
<P>The article with Ru&s;&s;ia, be&s;ides &s;tipulating an exemption from confi&s;cation for one year, with the privilege to remove and carry away in &s;afety, provides additionally, that the &s;ubjects of each party "&s;hall be further permitted either at or before their departure, to con&s;ign the effects which they &s;hall not yet have di&s;po&s;ed of, as well as the debts that &s;hall be due to them to &s;uch per&s;ons as they &s;hall think proper, in order to di&s;po&s;e of them <HI>according to their de&s;ire and for their benefit, which debts the debtors &s;hall be obliged to pay in the &s;ame manner as if no &s;uch rupture had happened.</HI>"</P>
<P>All the&s;e articles are, with tho&s;e in our treaties, analagous in princi|ple, as heretofore particularly explained to the 10th article of the treaty under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. That of the Briti&s;h treaty with France de|&s;ignates expre&s;sly debts due from the public as well as tho&s;e due from private per&s;ons. That with Ru&s;&s;ia goes the full length of our tenth article; empowering the creditors on each &s;ide to a&s;&s;ign the debts, which they are not able to collect within the term of their re&s;idence to whom&s;oever they think fit, for their own benefit, and declaring that the&s;e debts &s;hall be paid to the a&s;&s;ignees in the &s;ame manner as if no rupture had happened.</P>
<P>There is a document extant, which may fairly be &s;uppo&s;ed to expre&s;s the &s;en&s;e of the government of France, at the period to which it relates, of the foundation of the&s;e &s;tipulations. It is a memorial of Mr. Bu&s;&s;y, mini&s;ter from the Court of France to that of London, for negotiating peace, dated in the year 1761, and contains the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages. "As it is impracticable for two Princes, who make war with <HI>each other, to agree between them which is the aggre&s;&s;or with re|gard to the other</HI>&dagger;, equity and humanity have dictated the&s;e pre|cautions that where an unfor&s;een rupture happens &s;uddenly and with|out any previous declaration, foreign ve&s;&s;els, which, navigating <HI>under the &s;ecurity of peace,</HI> and of treaties happen, at the time of the rup|ture, to be in either of the re&s;pective ports, &s;hall have time and full liberty to withdraw them&s;elves.</P>
<P>"This wi&s;e provi&s;ion &s;o agreeable to the rules of good faith, <HI>con|&s;titutes a part of the law of nations,</HI> and the article of the treaty, which &s;anctifies the&s;e precautions, ought to be faithfully executed, notwith|&s;tanding the breach of the other articles of the treaty, which is the natural con&s;equence of the war."</P>
<P>"The Courts of France and Great-Britain u&s;ed this &s;alutary precaution in the treaties of Utrecht and Aix la Chapelle."</P>
<P>The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages place the &s;ecurity &s;tipulated in the treaties for the per&s;ons and property of the &s;ubjects of one party found in the country of another, at the beginning of a war, upon the footing of its <HI>con&s;ti|tuting a part of the law of nations</HI> which may be con&s;idered as a formal

<P>If the law of nations confers this exemption from &s;eizure upon ve&s;|&s;els, which at the time of the rupture, happen to be in the re&s;pec|tive ports of the belligerent parties, it is evident that it mu&s;t equally extend its protection to debts contracted in a cour&s;e of lawful trade. Ve&s;&s;els are particularly mentioned, becau&s;e the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion turned upon ve&s;&s;els &s;eized at &s;ea. But the reference to the treaties of Utrecht and Aix la Chapelle, &s;hews that the mini&s;ter in his ob&s;ervation, had in view the whole &s;ubject matter of the articles of tho&s;e treaties, which pro|vide for the &s;ecurity of merchants and their effects in time of war.</P>
<P>This conformity, in principle, of the article under examination, with the provi&s;ions in &s;o many treaties of our own and of other na|tions, taken in connection with the comment of Mr. Bu&s;&s;y, brings a very powerful &s;upport to the article. It is additional and full evi|dence that our Envoy, in agreeing to it, did not go upon new and untrodden ground; that on the contrary, he was in a beaten tract; that in pur&s;uing the dictates of rea&s;on, and the <HI>better opinion</HI> of writers as to the rule of the law of nations re&s;pecting the point, he was at the &s;ame time pur&s;uing the examples of all the other treaties which we had our&s;elves made, and of many of tho&s;e of other countries.</P>
<P>It is now incumbent upon me to perform my promi&s;e of replying to &s;uch objections to the Article as may remain unan&s;wered by the pre|ceding remarks. It is with plea&s;ure I note that the field is very narrow&mdash;that indeed there &s;carcely remains any thing which is not &s;o frivolous and unimportant as almo&s;t to forbid a &s;erious replication&mdash;It will therefore be my aim to be brief.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid there is only an apparent reciprocity in the article, millions being due on our &s;ide, and little or nothing on the other.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer to this is, that no right being relinqui&s;hed on either &s;ide, no privilege granted, the &s;tipulation amounting only to a recogni|tion of a rule of the law of nations, to a promi&s;e to ab&s;tain from in|ju&s;tice and breach of faith, there is no room for an argument about reciprocity further than to require that the promi&s;e &s;hould be mutual as is the ca&s;e&mdash;This is the only equiva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent which the nature of the &s;ubject demands or permits.&mdash;It would be di&s;honourable to except a boon merely for an engagement to fulfil a moral obligation&mdash;Indeed, as heretofore intimated, the true rule of reciprocity in the &s;tipulations of treaties is equal right, not equal advantage from each &s;everal &s;tipu|lation.</P>
<P>But it has been &s;hewn that the &s;tipulation will be beneficial to us, by the confidence which it will give on the other &s;ide, obviating and avoiding the ob&s;tructions to trade, the injuries to and incum|brances upon credit, naturally incident to the di&s;tru&s;t and appre|hen&s;ion, which after the que&s;tion had been once moved, were to be expected&mdash;Here, if a compen&s;ation were required, there is one&mdash;Let me add as a truth, which perhaps has no exception, however incon|genial with the fa&s;hionable patriotic creed, that in the wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e order or

<P>It is al&s;o &s;aid, that having bound our&s;elves by Treaty, we &s;hall hereafter lo&s;e the credit of moderation which would attend a for|bearance to exerci&s;e the right. But it having been demon&s;trated that no &s;uch right exi&s;ts, we only renounce a claim to the negative me|rit of not committing inju&s;tice, and we acquire the po&s;itive prai&s;e of exhibiting a willingne&s;s to renounce explicitly a preten&s;ion which might be the in&s;trument of oppre&s;&s;ion and fraud&mdash;It is always ho|nourable to give proof of upright intention.</P>
<P>It is further &s;aid, that under the protection of this &s;tipulation the King of Great Britain, who has already <HI>&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dated in our funds</HI> (the A&s;|&s;ertors would be puzzled to bring proof of the fact) may engro&s;s the whole capital of the Bank of the United States, and thereby &s;ecure the <HI>uncontrouled direction</HI> of it&mdash;that he may hold the &s;tock in the name of his <HI>Amba&s;&s;ador,</HI> or of &s;ome Citizen of the United States, per|haps a &s;enator, who if of the Virtuous twenty* might be proud of the honour&mdash;that thus our Citizens in time of peace might experience the mortification of being beholden to <HI>Briti&s;h Directors,</HI> for the acco|modations they might want, that in time of war our operations might be cramped at the plea&s;ure of his maje&s;ty, and according as he &s;hould &s;ee fit or not to accomodate our government with loans&mdash;and, that both in peace and war we may be reduced to the abject condi|tion of having the whole capital of our National Bank admini&s;tered by his Britannic maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Shall I treat this rhap&s;ody with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s or with ridicule?</P>
<P>The capital of the bank of the United States is ten millions of dol|lars, little &s;hort at the pre&s;ent market price, of three millions of pounds &s;terling&mdash;but from the natural operation of &s;uch a demand in rai&s;ing price, its not probable that much le&s;s than four millions &s;terling would &s;uffice to complete the monopoly. I have never un|der&s;tood, that the private pur&s;e of his Britannic maje&s;ty, if it be true as a&s;&s;erted, that he has already witne&s;&s;ed a reli&s;h for &s;pecula|tion in our funds (a fact however from which it was natural to in|fer a more pacific di&s;po&s;ition towards us) was &s;o very ample as con|veniently to &s;pare an item of &s;uch &s;ize for a &s;peculation acro&s;s the atlantic. But perhaps the national pur&s;e will be brought to his aid As this &s;uppo&s;es a parliamentary grant, new taxes and new loans, it does not &s;eem to be a very manageable thing, without di&s;clo&s;ure of the object, and if di&s;clo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d, &s;o very unexampled an attempt of a foreign government would pre&s;ent a ca&s;e completely out of the reach of all ordinary rules, ju&s;tifying by the manife&s;t dang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r to us even war and the confi&s;cation of all that had been purcha&s;ed. For let it be remembered, that the article does not protect the public proper|ty of a foreign government, prince, or &s;tate, independent of the ob&s;ervation ju&s;t made, that &s;uch a ca&s;e would be without the reach of ordinary rules. It may be added, that an attempt of this kind, from the force of the pecuniary capital of Great Britain, would as a precedent threaten and alarm all nations.&mdash;Would con&s;equences like the&s;e be incurred?</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="028795_0136_0FDD4A7776F65000">But let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the inclination &s;hall exi&s;t and that all difficulties about funds have been &s;urmounted&mdash;&s;till to effect the plan there mu&s;t be in all the &s;tockholders a willingne&s;s to &s;ell to the Bri|ti&s;h king or his agents, as well as the will and means on his part to purcha&s;e. Here too &s;ome impediment might be experienced&mdash;There are per&s;ons who might choo&s;e to keep their property in the &s;hape of bank &s;tock, and live upon the income of it, whom price would not readily tempt to part with it. Be&s;ides, there is an additional ob|&s;tacle to complete &s;ucce&s;s. The United States them&s;elves are pro|prietors of two millions of the bank &s;tock.</P>
<P>Of two things, one, either the monopoly of his Britannic maje&s;ty would be known (and it would be a pretty arduous ta&s;k to keep it a &s;ecret e&s;pecially if the &s;tock was to &s;tand as &s;ugge&s;ted in the name of his <HI>amba&s;&s;ador</HI>) or it would be unknown and concealed under un&s;u&s;pect|ed names&mdash;In the former &s;uppo&s;ition, the ob&s;ervations already made cur.

<P>If to avoid this, the plan &s;hould be to keep the operation unknown, the mo&s;t effectual method would be to place the &s;tock in the names of our own citizens. This it &s;eems would be attended with no difficul|ty; &s;ince even our &s;enators would be ambitious of the honour; and if they &s;hould have qualms and fears, others more compliant could no doubt be found among&s;t the numerous &s;ectaries or adherents of Great Britain in our country.&mdash;probably &s;ome of the patriots would not be inexorable if properly &s;olicited. Or in the la&s;t re&s;ource per&s;ons might be &s;ent from Great Britain to acquire naturalization for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In this &s;uppo&s;ition too, the article would be at the lea&s;t innocent:</P>
<P>For its prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ions are entirely foreign to the ca&s;e of &s;tock &s;tand|ing in the names of our own citizens. It neither enlarges nor abridges the power of the government in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Further, how will the article work the miracle, of placing the bank under the management of <HI>Briti&s;h Directors?</HI> It gives no new rights, no new qualifications:</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of the bank (&s;ections 5 and 7 of the act of incorpo|ration) has provided with &s;olicitude the&s;e important guards, again&s;t foreign or other &s;ini&s;ter influence&mdash;1. That none but a <HI>Citizen of the United States</HI> &s;hall be <HI>eligible</HI> as a DIRE<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">TOR. 2. That none but a &s;tockholder <HI>actually re&s;ident within the United States,</HI> &s;hall vote in elections <HI>by proxy.</HI> 3: That one fourth of the <HI>directors,</HI> who are to be elected annually, mu&s;t every year go out of the direction. 4. That a <HI>director</HI> may at any time be removed and replaced by the &s;tock|holders at a gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ral meeting. 5. That a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> &s;hare &s;hall give <HI>one vote</HI> for <HI>directors</HI> while <HI>any number</HI> of &s;hares, in the &s;ame per&s;on, copartner&s;hip or body politic, will not give more than <HI>thirty</HI> votes.</P>
<P>Hence it is impo&s;&s;ible, that the bank can be in the management of <HI>Briti&s;h directors</HI>&mdash; A Briti&s;h &s;ubject being <HI>incapable</HI> of being a <HI>director.</HI> It is al&s;o next to impo&s;&s;ible that an undue Briti&s;h influence could ope|rate in the choice of directors, out of the number of our own ci|tizens.

<P>But here again it is to be remembered, that as to combinations with our own citizens, in which they were to be o&s;ten&s;ible, for any pernicious foreign project&mdash;the article under con&s;ideration is perfec|ctly nugatory &mdash;It can do neither good nor harm, &s;ince it merely re|lates, as to the exemption from confi&s;cation and &s;eizure on our part, to the known property of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>It follows, therefore, that the dangers pourtrayed to us from the &s;peculating enterprizes of his Britannic maje&s;ty are the vagaries of an overheated imagination&mdash;or the contrivances of a &s;pirit of decep|tion &mdash;and that &s;o far as they could be &s;uppo&s;ed to have the lea&s;t colour, it turns upon circum&s;tances, upon which the treaty can have no influence whatever. In taking pains to expo&s;e their futility, I have been principally led by the de&s;ire of making my fellow citizens &s;en&s;ible, in this in&s;tance as in others, of the extravagancies of the oppo&s;ers of the treaty.</P>
<P>One artifice to render the article unacceptable has been to put ca&s;es of extreme mi&s;conduct, on the other &s;ide, of flagrant violations of the law of Nations, of war, of ju&s;tice and of humanity; and to a&s;k whether under &s;uch circum&s;tances the confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration of debts, would not be ju&s;tifiable&mdash;To this the an&s;wer is, that if circum&s;tances &s;o extraordinary &s;hould ari&s;e as, without the treaty, would warrant &s;o extraordinary an act, they will equally warrant it under the treaty. For ca&s;es of this kind are exceptions to all general rules. They would excu&s;e the violation of an expre&s;s or po&s;itive, as well as of a tacit or virtual pledge of the public faith: which de|&s;cribes the whole difference between the exi&s;tence and non-exi&s;tence of the article in que&s;tion. They re&s;emble tho&s;e ca&s;es of extreme nece&s;|&s;ity (through exce&s;&s;ive hunger for in&s;tance) which in the eye of the law of nature will excu&s;e the taking of the property of another, or tho&s;e ca&s;es of extreme abu&s;e of authority in rulers, which amounting un|equivocally to tyranny, are admitted to ju&s;tify forcible re&s;i&s;tance to the e&s;tabli&s;hed authorities.&mdash;Con&s;titutions of government, laws, trea|ties all give way to extremities of &s;uch a de&s;cription&mdash;the point of obligation is to di&s;tingui&s;h them with &s;incerity, and not to indulge our pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts in &s;ub&s;tituting pretended for real ca&s;es.</P>
<P>A writer, who di&s;graces by adopting the name of CICERO, makes a curious remark by way of objection. He affirms that the article is nugatory, becau&s;e a treaty is di&s;&s;olved by a &s;tate of war, in which &s;tate the provi&s;ion is de&s;igned to operate.

There can then be no danger that patrioti&s;m will have to lament, or national honour to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;h at, the &s;entence which you &s;hall pronounce.</P>
<P>The articles, which adju&s;t the matters of controver&s;y between the two countries, all tho&s;e which are permanent, have now been re|viewed. Let me appeal to the conferences of tho&s;e who have accom|panied me in the review&mdash;if the&s;e articles were all that compo&s;ed the treaty, would it be better, that they &s;hould exi&s;t&mdash;or that all the &s;ources of rupture and war with Great-Britain &s;hould have &s;urvived

the negociation to extingui&s;h them, and &s;hould &s;till actually &s;ub&s;i&s;t in full vigour? If every enlightened and hone&s;t man mu&s;t prefer the former&mdash;then let me make another ob&s;ervation and put another que&s;|tion. The remaining articles of the treaty, which, con&s;tituting its commercial parts, expire by their own limitation at the end of <HI>twelve</HI> years. It is in the power of either party con&s;i&s;tently with the in&s;tru|ment to terminate them at the end of the expiration of <HI>two</HI> years after the pre&s;ent war between France and Great-Britain.</P>
<P>Is it at all probable that they can contain any thing injurious, con&s;i|dering the &s;hort duration, which may be given to them, as to counter-balance the important con&s;ideration of pre&s;erving peace to this young country; as to warrant the exce&s;&s;ive clamours which have been rai&s;ed, as to authorize the horrid calumnies which are invented; and to ju&s;|tify the &s;y&s;tematic efforts which are in operation to convul&s;e our coun|try and to hazard even CIVIL WAR.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In applying the character of di&s;hone&s;ty and turpitude to the prin|ciple of confi&s;cation or &s;eque&s;tration; I am far from intending to brand as di&s;hone&s;t men, all tho&s;e who&s;e opinions favor it; I know there are &s;ome ardent &s;pirits chargeable with the error, of who&s;e in|ntegrity I think well.</NOTE></P>
