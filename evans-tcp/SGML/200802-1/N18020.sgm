</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OBSERVE in the&s;e Words. 1. Something that &s;ome depended on, as an Evidence of their good E&s;tate, and Acceptance, as the Objects of GOD's Favour, viz. a &s;peculative Faith, or Belief of the Doctrines of Religion. The great Doctrine of the Exi&s;tence of one only GOD is particularly mentioned; probably, becau&s;e this was a Doctrine wherein, e&s;pecially, there was a vi&s;ible and not|ed Di&s;tinction, between profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians and the Heathens, among&s;t whom the Chri&s;tians in tho&s;e Days were di&s;per&s;ed: And therefore, this was what many tru&s;ted in, as what recommended them <HI>to</HI>; or at lea&s;t, was an Evidence <HI>of,</HI> their Intere&s;t in the great &s;piritual and eternal Privileges, in which Chri&s;tians were di&s;tingu&s;hed from the re&s;t of the World.</P>
<P N="2">2. How much is allowed concerning this Faith, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is a good Attainment: <HI>Thou dost well.</HI> It was good, as it was nece&s;&s;ary. This Doctrine was one of the fun|damental Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity; and, in &s;ome re&s;pects, above all others fundamental. It was nece&s;&s;ary to be be|lieved, in order to Salvation: And a Being without the Belief of this Doctrine, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e that had &s;uch Ad|vantage to know as they had, whom the Apo&s;tle wrote to, would be a great Sin, and what would va&s;tly aggravate
<PB N="5" REF="023344_0004_0FBF074DA5723268">
their Damnation. This Belief was al&s;o good, as it had a good Tendency in many Re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="3">3. What is implicitly denied concerning it, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is any Evidence of a Per&s;on's being in a State of Sal|vation. The whole Context, &s;hews this to be the De&s;ign of the Apo&s;tle in the Words: And, it is particularly manife&s;t, by the Conclu&s;ion of the Ver&s;e; which is the</P>
<P N="4">4. Thing ob&s;ervable in the Words, viz. The Argu|ment by which the Apo&s;tle proves, that this is no Sign of a State of Grace, viz. that it is found in the Devils. They believe that there is one GOD, and that He is a holy &s;in hating GOD; and that He is a GOD of Truth, and will fulfill his Threatnings, by which He he has denounc|ed future Judgments, and a great increa&s;e of Mi&s;ery on them; and that He is an Almighty GOD, and able to execute his threatened Vengeance upon them.</P>
<P>Therefore, the DOCTRINE I infer from the Words, to make the Subject of my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e, is this.</P>
<P><HI>Nothing in the Mind of Man, that is of the &s;ame Nature with what the Devils experience, or are the &s;ubjects of, is any &s;ure Sign of &s;aving Grace.</HI></P>
<P>If there be any Thing that the Devils have, or find in them&s;elves, which is an Evidence of the &s;aving Grace of the Spirit of GOD, then the Apo&s;tle's Argument is not good; which is plainly this: <HI>That which is in the Devils, or which they do, is no certain Evidence of Grace. But the Devils believe that there is one</HI> GOD. <HI>Therefore, thy believ|ing that there is one</HI> GOD, <HI>is no &s;ure Evidence that thou art gracious.</HI> So that the whole Foundation of the Apo&s;tle's Argument lies in that Propo&s;ition. <HI>That which is in the Devils is no certain &s;ign of Grace.</HI></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, I &s;hall mention two or three further Rea|&s;ons or Arguments of the Truth of this Doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">I. The Devils have no Degree of <HI>Holine&s;s</HI>: and there|fore, tho&s;e Things, which are Nothing beyond what they are the &s;ubjects of, cannot be <HI>holy Experiences.</HI></P>
<P>The Devil once was holy; but when he fell, he lo&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="023344_0005_0FBF07504C3503E8">
all his Holine&s;s, and became perfectly wicked. He is the greate&s;t Sinner, and in &s;ome Sen&s;e, the Father of all Sin. John viii. 44. <HI>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the Lu&s;ts of your Father ye will do. He was a Murderer from the Beginning and abode not in the Truth; becau&s;e there was no Truth in him: When he &s;peaketh a Lie, he &s;peaketh of his own; for he is a Liar and the Father of it.</HI> 1 John iii. 8. <HI>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil; for the Devil &s;in|neth from the Beginning.</HI> He is often &s;poken of, as by Way of Eminence, THE WICKED ONE. So, Matt. xiii. 19. <HI>Then cometh</HI> the wicked One, <HI>and catcheth away that which was &s;own in his Heart.</HI> v. 38. <HI>The Tares are the Children of</HI> the wicked One. 1 John, ii. 13. <HI>I write unto you young Men, becau&s;e ye have overcome</HI> the wicked One. Chap. iii. 12. <HI>Not as</HI> Cain, <HI>who was of that</HI> wicked One. Chap. v. 18. <HI>Who&s;oever is born of</HI> GOD&mdash;keepeth him&s;elf, <HI>and that</HI> wicked One <HI>toucheth him not.</HI> So the Devils are called <HI>evil Spirits, unclean Spirits, Powers of Darkne&s;s, Rulers of the Darkne&s;s of this World,</HI> and <HI>Wickedne&s;s</HI> it&s;elf: Eph vi 12. <HI>For we wre&s;tle not again&s;t Fle&s;h and Blood; but again&s;t Principalities, again&s;t Powers, again&s;t</HI> the Ru|lers of the Darkne&s;s of this World, <HI>again&s;t &s;piritual</HI> Wick|edne&s;s <HI>in high Places.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, &s;urely tho&s;e Things which the Minds of Devils are the Subjects of, can have nothing of the Na|ture of true Holine&s;s in them. The Knowledge and Un|der&s;tanding which they have of the Things of GOD and Religion, cannot be of the Nature of divine and holy Light, nor any Knowledge that is merely of the &s;ame Kind. No &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions as are made on their Hearts, can be of a &s;piritual Nature. That Kind of Sen&s;e, which they have of divine Things, however great, cannot be an holy Sen&s;e. Such Affections as move their Hearts, how|ever powerful, cannot be holy Affections. If there be no Holine&s;s in them, as they are in the Devil, there can be no Holine&s;s in them as they are in Man; unle&s;s &s;ome|thing be added to them, beyond what is in them, or they
<PB N="7" REF="023344_0006_0FBF07531B817D18">
are in the Devil. And if any Thing be added to them, then they are not the &s;ame Things; but are &s;omething beyond what Devils are the Subjects of; which is contra|ry to the Suppo&s;ition; for the Propo&s;ition which I am upon, is, that tho&s;e Things which are of the <HI>&s;ame Nature,</HI> and <HI>nothing beyond</HI> what Devils are the Subjects of, cannot be holy Experiences. 'Tis not the Subject that makes the Affection, or Experience, or Quality holy; but 'tis the Quality that makes the Subject holy.</P>
<P>And if tho&s;e Qualities and Experiences, which the De|vils are the Subjects of, have nothing of the Nature of Holine&s;s in them; then they can be no certain Signs, that Per&s;ons which have them, are holy or gracious. There is no certain Sign of true Grace, but tho&s;e Things which are &s;piritual and gracious. 'Tis GOD's Image that is his Seal and Mark, the Stamp, by which tho&s;e that are his, are known. But that, which has Nothing of the Nature of Holine&s;s, has Nothing of this Image. That, which is a &s;ure Sign of Grace, mu&s;t either be &s;omething, which has the Nature and E&s;&s;ence of Grace; or is flowing from, or &s;ome way belonging to its E&s;&s;ence: For that, which di&s;tingui&s;hes Things one from another, in their E&s;|&s;ence, or &s;omething appertaining to their E&s;&s;ence. And therefore, that which is &s;ometimes found wholly without the E&s;&s;ence of Holine&s;s or Grace, can be no e&s;&s;ential, &s;ure, or di&s;tingu&s;hing Mark of Grace.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Devils are not only ab&s;olutely without all true Holine&s;s, but they are not &s;o much as the Subjects of any common Grace.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould imagine, that &s;ome Things may be Signs of Grace, which are not Grace it&s;elf, or which have no|thing of the Nature and E&s;&s;ence of Grace and Holine&s;s in them; yet, certainly they will allow, that the Qualificati|ons, which are &s;ure Evidences of Grace, mu&s;t be things that are near akin to Grace, or having &s;ome remarkable Affinity with it. But the Devils are not only wholly de|&s;titute of any true Holine&s;s; but they are at the great|e&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="023344_0007_0FBF075552264168">
Di&s;tance from it, and have nothing in them&punc; in any wi&s;e akin to it.</P>
<P>There are many in this World, who are wholly de&s;ti|tute of &s;aving Grace, who yet have common Grace: They have no true Holine&s;s, but neverthele&s;s, have &s;omething of that which is called <HI>moral virtue</HI>; and are the Subject of &s;ome Degree of the common Influences of the Spirit of GOD. 'Tis &s;o with tho&s;e in general, that live under the Light of the Go&s;pel, and are not given up to judicial Blindne&s;s and Hardne&s;s. Yea, tho&s;e that are thus given up, yet have &s;ome Degree of re&s;training Grace, while they live in this World; without which, the Earth could not bear them, and they would in no Mea&s;ure, be tolerable Members of human Society. But when any are damned, or ca&s;t into Hell, as the Devils are, GOD whol|ly withdraws his re&s;training Grace, and all merciful In|fluences of his Spirit what&s;oever: And they have neither &s;aving Grace, nor common Grace; neither the Grace of the Spirit; nor any of the common Gifts of the Spirit; neither true Holine&s;s, nor moral Virtue of any kind. Hence ari&s;es the va&s;t Increa&s;e of the Exerci&s;e of Wick|edne&s;s in the Hearts of Men, when they are damned. And herein is the chief Difference between the damned in Hell, and unregenerate and gracele&s;s Men in this World: Not that wicked Men in this World, have any more Holine&s;s or true virtue than the damned, or that wicked Men, when they leave this World, have any prin|ciples of Wickedne&s;s infu&s;ed into them: But when Men are ca&s;t into Hell, GOD perfectly takes away his Spirit from them, as to all it's merciful common Influences, and entirely withdraws from them, all Re&s;traints of his Spirit and good Providence.</P>
<P N="3">III. It is unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that a Per&s;on's being in any Re&s;pect as the Devil is, &s;hould be a certain Sign, that he is very unlike, and oppo&s;ite to him; and hereafter, &s;hall not have his part with him. True Saints are ex|tremely unlike, and contrary to the Devil, both relative
<PB N="9" REF="023344_0008_0FBF0756C21F9FF8">
and really. They are &s;o <HI>relatively.</HI> The Devil is the grand Rebel; the chief Enemy of GOD and CHRIST; the Object of GOD's greate&s;t Wrath; a condemned Male|factor, utterly rejected and ca&s;t off by him; forever &s;hut out of his Pre&s;ence; the Pri&s;oner of his Ju&s;tice; an ever|la&s;ting inhabitant of the infernal World. The Saints, on the contrary, are the Citizens of the heavenly <HI>Jeru|&s;alem</HI>; Members of the Family, of the glorious KING of Heaven; the Children of GOD; the Brethren and Spou&s;e of his dear Son; Heirs of GOD; Joint-heirs with CHRIST; Kings and Prie&s;ts unto GOD. And they are extremely different <HI>really.</HI> The Devil, on Account of his hateful Nature, and tho&s;e accur&s;ed Di&s;po&s;itions which reign in Him, is called <HI>Satan,</HI> the Adver&s;ary, <HI>Abaddon</HI> and <HI>Apol|lyon,</HI> the Great De&s;troyer, <HI>the Wolf, the roaring Lion, the great Dragon, the old Serpent.</HI> The Saints are repre&s;ent|ed as GOD's <HI>holy Ones,</HI> his <HI>anointed Ones, the Excellent of the Earth; the Meek of the Earth; Lambs</HI> and <HI>Doves</HI>; CHRIST's <HI>little Children</HI>; having the <HI>Image of</HI> GOD, <HI>pure in heart</HI>; GOD's <HI>Jewels; Lilies in</HI> CHRIST<HI>'s Garden; Plants</HI> of Pa|radi&s;e; <HI>Stars of Heaven; Temples of the Living GOD.</HI> The Saints, &s;o far as they are &s;aints, are as diver&s;e from the Devil, as Heaven is from Hell; and much more contra|ry than light is to darkne&s;s: And the eternal &s;tate that they are appointed to, is an&s;werably diver&s;e and contrary.</P>
<P>Now it is not rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that a being, in any re&s;pect, as <HI>Satan</HI> is, or the being the &s;ubject of, any of the &s;ame properties, qualifications, affections, or acti|ons, that are in him, is any certain evidence, that Per|&s;ons are thus exceeding different from him; and in cir|cum&s;tances &s;o diver&s;e, and appointed to an eternal &s;tate, &s;o extremely contrary in all re&s;pects. Wicked Men, are in &s;cripture, called the <HI>children of the Devil.</HI> Now is it rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that Men's being, in any re&s;pect, as the Devil is, can be a certain &s;ign, that they are not his children, but the Children of the infinitely holy and ble&s;&s;|ed GOD? We are informed, that wicked Men, &s;hall
<PB N="10" REF="023344_0009_0FBF07582B406728">
hereafter, have their part with Devils; &s;hall be &s;en|tenced to the &s;ame everla&s;ting fire, which is prepared for the Devil and his angels. Now, can a man's being like the Devil in any re&s;pect, be a &s;ure token that he &s;hall not have his part with him, but with glorious Angels, and with JESUS CHRIST, dwelling with him, where he is, that he may behold, and partake of his glory?</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t USE may lie in &s;everal inferrences, for our <HI>In&s;truction.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. From what has been &s;aid, it may be infer'd, by pa|rity of rea&s;on, that nothing that <HI>damned men</HI> do, or ever will experience, can be any &s;ure &s;ign of grace.</P>
<P><HI>Damned men</HI> are like the <HI>Devils</HI>; are conformed to 'em in nature and &s;tate. They have nothing better in them than the Devils; have no higher principles in their hearts; experience nothing, and do nothing of a more excellent kind: As they are the children and &s;ervants of the De|vil; and as &s;uch &s;hall dwell with him, and be partakers with him, of the &s;ame mi&s;ery. As CHRIST &s;ays, con|cerning the &s;aints, in their future &s;tate; Matt. xxii. 30. That <HI>they &s;hall be as the Angels of</HI> GOD <HI>in Heaven:</HI> So it may be &s;aid concerning ungodly men, in their future &s;tate; that they <HI>&s;hall be as the fallen, wicked Angels in Hell.</HI></P>
<P>Each of the forementioned rea&s;ons, given to &s;hew the truth of the doctrine, with re&s;pect to Devils, hold good with re&s;pect to damned men. Damned men have no de|gree of holine&s;s&punc; And thererefore, tho&s;e things, which are nothing beyond what they have, cannot be holy ex|periences. So it is true, that the damned men, are not only ab&s;olutely de&s;titute of all true holine&s;s, but they have not &s;o much as any common grace. And la&s;tly, 'tis unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that a per&s;on's being in any re&s;pect, as the damned in Hell are, &s;hould be a certain &s;ign, that they are very unlike and oppo&s;ite to them, and hereafter, &s;hall not have their portion with them.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="11" REF="023344_0010_0FBF075A69068C58">II. We may hence infer, that no degree of &s;peculative knowledge of things, of Religion, is any certain &s;ign of &s;aving grace. The Devil, before his fall, was among tho&s;e bright and glorious Angels of Heaven, which are repre&s;ented as morning &s;tars, and flames of fire, that ex|cel in &s;trength and wi&s;dom. And tho' he be now become &s;inful, yet his &s;in has not aboli&s;hed the faculties of the angelick nature; as when man fell, he did not lo&s;e the faculties of the human nature. Sin de&s;troys <HI>&s;piritual principles,</HI> but not the <HI>natural faculties.</HI> 'Tis true, &s;in, when in full dominion, entirely prevents the exerci&s;e of the natural faculties, in holy and &s;piritual under&s;tanding; and lays many impediments in the way of their proper exerci&s;e in other re&s;pects: It lays the natural faculty of rea&s;on, under great di&s;advantages, by the many and &s;trong prejudices, which the mind is brought under the power of: And in fallen man, the faculties of the &s;oul, are, doubtle&s;s, greatly impeded in their exerci&s;e, through that great weakne&s;s and di&s;order of the corporeal organ, which it is &s;trictly united to; which is the con&s;equence of &s;in. But there &s;eems to be nothing in the nature of &s;in, or moral corruption, that has any tendency to de&s;troy the natural capacity; or even to dimini&s;h it, properly &s;peak|ing. If &s;in were of &s;uch a nature, as nece&s;&s;arily to have that tendency and effect; then it might be expected, that wicked men, in a future &s;tate, where they are given up entirely to the unre&s;trained exerci&s;e of their corruptions and lu&s;ts, and &s;in is, in all re&s;pects, brought to its great|e&s;t perfection in them, would have the capacity of their &s;ouls greatly dimini&s;hed: Which we have no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e; but rather on the contrary; that their capaci|ties are greatly enlarged, and that their actual knowledge is va&s;tly increa&s;ed; and that even with re&s;pect to the Divine Being, and the things of Religion, and the great concerns of the immortal &s;ouls of men; and that, with regard to the&s;e things, the eyes of wicked men are open'd; and they, in &s;ome re&s;pects, emerge out of darkne&s;s into
<PB N="12" REF="023344_0011_0FBF07637112BA98">
clear light, when they go into another world.</P>
<P>The greatne&s;s of the abilities of the Devils, may be argued, from the repre&s;entation in <HI>Eph.</HI> vi. 12. <HI>We wre&s;|tle not again&s;t fle&s;h and blood, but again&s;t principalities, again&s;t powers, &amp;c.</HI> The &s;ame may al&s;o be argued, from what the &s;cripture &s;ays of Satan's &s;ubtilty. <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 1. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi. 3. <HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 10.</P>
<P>And as the Devil has a faculty of under&s;tanding of large capacity, &s;o he is capable of great &s;peculative know|ledge, of the things of GOD, and the invi&s;ible and eter|nal world, as well as other things; and mu&s;t needs, ac|tually, have a great under&s;tanding of the&s;e things; as the&s;e are the things which have always been chiefly in his view; and as his circum&s;tances, from his fir&s;t exi&s;t|ence, have been &s;uch as have tended chiefly to engage him to attend to the&s;e things. Before his fall, he was one of tho&s;e <HI>Angels, who continually beheld the face of the Fa|ther, which is in Heaven.</HI> And &s;in has no tendency to de&s;troy the memory: And therefore, has no tendency to blot out of it, any &s;peculative knowledge that was for|merly there.</P>
<P>As the Devil's &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">lity, &s;hews his great capacity; &s;o the way in which his &s;ubtility is exerci&s;ed and manife&s;ted; which is principally in his artful management, with re&s;|pect to things of religion; his exceeding &s;ubtile repre&s;en|tations, in&s;inuations, rea&s;onings and temptations, con|cerning the&s;e things, demon&s;trates his great actual un|der&s;tanding of them. As in order to the being a very artful di&s;putant in any &s;cience, tho' it be only to con|found and deceive &s;uch as are conver&s;ant in the &s;cience; a per&s;on had need to have a great and exten&s;ive ac|quaintance with the things, which pertain to that &s;cience.</P>
<P>Thus the Devil has, undoubtedly, a great degree of &s;peculative knowledge in divinity; having been, as it were, educated in the be&s;t divinity &s;chool in the uni|ver&s;e, viz. The Heaven of Heavens. He mu&s;t needs
<PB N="13" REF="023344_0012_0FBF0765B860DC80">
have &s;uch an exten&s;ive and accurate knowledge, concern|ing the nature and attributes of GOD, as we, worms of the du&s;t, in our pre&s;ent &s;tate, are not capable of. And he mu&s;t have a far more exten&s;ive knowledge of the works of GOD; as of the work of creation in particular; for he was a &s;pectator of the creation of this vi&s;ible world: He was one of tho&s;e <HI>morning &s;tars</HI> that we read of, <HI>Job</HI> xxxviii. 4, 5, 6, 7. who <HI>&s;ang together,</HI> and of tho&s;e <HI>Sons of GOD,</HI> that <HI>&s;houted for joy, when</HI> GOD <HI>laid the foun|dations of the Earth, and laid the mea&s;ures thereof, and &s;tretched the line upon it.</HI> And &s;o he mu&s;t have a very great knowledge of GOD's works of Providence: He has been a &s;pectator of the &s;eries of the&s;e works from the beginning: He has &s;een how GOD has governed the world in all ages: He has &s;een the whole train of GOD's won|derful &s;ucce&s;&s;ive di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence towards <HI>his church,</HI> from generation to generation. And he has not been an indifferent &s;pectator; but the great oppo&s;ition, which there has been between GOD and him, in the whole cour&s;e of tho&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations; has nece&s;&s;arily, greatly engaged his attention, in the &s;tricte&s;t ob&s;ervation of them. He mu&s;t have a great degree of knowledge, concerning JESUS CHRIST, as the &s;aviour of men; and the nature and method of the work of redemption, and the won|derful wi&s;dom of GOD in this contrivance. 'Tis that work of GOD, wherein, above all others, GOD has acted in oppo&s;ition to him; and in which he has chiefly &s;et him&s;elf in oppo&s;ition to GOD. 'Tis with relation to this affair, that that mighty warfare has been maintained, which has been carried on between <HI>Michael</HI> and his Angels, and the Devil and his Angels, through all ages, from the beginning of the World; and e&s;pecially, &s;ince Chri&s;t appeared in the world. The Devil has had enough to engage his attention, to the &s;teps of divine wi&s;dom in this work; for 'tis to that wi&s;dom he has oppo&s;ed his &s;ubtility: And he has &s;een, and found, to his great di&s;appointment, and un&s;peakable torment; how divine wi&s;dom, as exer|ci&s;ed

in that work, has baffled and confounded his devi|ces. He has a great knowledge of the things of another world; for the things of that world, are in his immediate view. He has a great knowledge of Heaven; for he has been an inhabitant of that world of Glory: And he has a great knowledge of Hell, and the nature of its mi&s;ery; for he is the fir&s;t inhabitant of Hell; and above all the other inhabitants, has experience of its torment, and has felt them con&s;tantly, for more than fifty-&s;even hundred years. He mu&s;t have a great knowledge of the holy &s;criptures; for 'tis evident, he is not hindred from know|ing what is written there, by the u&s;e he made of the words of &s;cripture, in his temptation of our Saviour. And if he can know, he has much opportunity to know, and mu&s;t needs have a di&s;po&s;itton to know, with the greate&s;t exactne&s;s; that he may, to greater effect, prevent and wre&s;t the &s;cripture, and prevent &s;uch an effect of the word of GOD on the hearts of men, as &s;hall tend to overthrow his kingdom. He mu&s;t have a great knowledge of the nature of mankind, their capacity, their di&s;po&s;itions, and the corruptions of their hearts; for he has had long and great ob&s;ervations and experience. The heart of man, is what he has had chiefly to do with, in his &s;ubtile devi|ces, mighty efforts, re&s;tle&s;s and indefatigable operations and exertions of him&s;elf, from the beginning of the world&punc; And 'tis evident, that he has a great &s;peculative know|ledge of the nature of experimental Religion, by his be|ing able to imitate it &s;o artfully, and in &s;uch a manner, as to <HI>transform him&s;elf into an Angel of light.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore it is manife&s;t, from my text and doctrine, that no degree of &s;peculative knowledge of things of Re|ligion, is any certain &s;ign of true piety. Whatever clear notions a man may have of the attributes of GOD, and doctrine of the Trinity; the nature of the two covenants, the economy of the per&s;ons of the Trinity, and the part which each per&s;on has in the affair of man's redemption; if he can di&s;cour&s;e never &s;o excellently of the offices of

CHRIST, and the way of &s;alvation by him, and the ad|mirable methods of divine wi&s;dom; and the harmony of the various attributes of GOD in that way; if he can talk never &s;o clearly and exactly of the method of the ju&s;tifi|cation of a &s;inner, and of the nature of conver&s;ion, and the operations of the &s;pirit of GOD, in applying the re|demption of CHRIST; giving good di&s;tinctions, happily &s;olving difficulties, and an&s;wering objections; in a man|ner tending greatly to the enlightening the ignorant, to the edification of the church of GOD, and the convicti|on of gain&s;ayers; and the great increa&s;e of light in the world: If he has more knowledge of this &s;ort than hun|dreds of true &s;aints, of an ordinary education, and mo&s;t divines; yet all is no certain evidence of any degree of &s;aving grace in the heart.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the &s;cripture often &s;peaks of knowledge of divine things, as what is peculiar to true &s;aints; as in John xvii. <HI>This is eternal life, that they may know thee, the only true</HI> GOD, <HI>and</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI> Matt. xii. 27. <HI>No man knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, &s;ave the Son, and he to whom|&s;oever the Son will reveal him.</HI> P&s;. ix. 10. <HI>They that know thy name, will put their trust in thee.</HI> Philip. iii. 8. <HI>I count all things but lo&s;s, for the excellency of the knowledge of</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>my Lord.</HI> But then, we mu&s;t under&s;tand it of a dif|ferent kind of knowledge, from that &s;peculative under|&s;tanding&punc; which the Devil has to &s;o great a degree. It will al&s;o be allowed, that the &s;piritual &s;aving knowledge of GOD, and divine things, greatly promotes &s;peculative knowledge; as it engages the mind in its &s;earch into things of this kind, and mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t to a di&s;tinct under|&s;tanding of them; &s;o that, other things being equal, they that have &s;piritual knowledge, are much more likely than others, to have a good doctrinal acquaintance with things of Religion&mdash;but yet, &s;uch acquaintance may be no di&s;|tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of true &s;aints.</P>
<P N="3">III. It may al&s;o be inferr'd from what has been ob|&s;erv'd,
<PB N="16" REF="023344_0015_0FBF076A6A608E78">
that for per&s;ons meerly to yield a &s;peculative a&s;&s;ent to the doctrines of Religion as true, is no certain evidence of a &s;tate of grace. My text tells us, that the Devils <HI>be|live,</HI> and as they believe that there is one GOD, &s;o they believe the truth of the doctrines of Religion in general. The devil is orthodox in his faith&mdash;he believes the true &s;cheme of Doctrine&mdash;he is no <HI>Deist, Socinian, Arian, Pe|lagian</HI> or <HI>Antinomian</HI>&mdash;the articles of his faith are all &s;ound, and what he is thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed in.</P>
<P>Therefore, for a per&s;on to believe the doctrines of Chri&s;|tianity, merely from the influence of things &s;peculative, or from the force of arguments, as di&s;cerned only by &s;peculation, is no evidence of grace.</P>
<P>Tho' 'tis probably a very rare thing, for unregenerate men, to have a &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth of the doc|trines of Religion, e&s;pecially, &s;uch of 'em as are very my&s;terious, and much above the comprehen&s;ion of rea|&s;on: Yet 'tis manife&s;t, that we have no warrant to de|termine, that it can never be &s;o, or to look upon &s;uch a per&s;ua&s;ion, as an infalliable evidence of grace&mdash;and that no per&s;on can &s;afely determine his &s;tate to be good from &s;uch an evidence. Yet if he, not only him&s;elf, &s;eems to be very confident of the truth of Chri&s;tianity and its doc|trines, but is able to argue mo&s;t &s;trongly for the proof of them&mdash;yet in this, he goes nothing beyond the Devil&mdash; who, doubtle&s;s, has a great knowledge of the rational ar|guments, by which the truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and its &s;everal principles are evinced.</P>
<P>And therefore, when the &s;cripture &s;peaks of <HI>believing that</HI> JESUS <HI>is the Son of</HI> GOD, as a &s;ure evidence of grace, as in 1. John v. 1. and other places, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood, not of a mere &s;peculative a&s;&s;ent, but of another kind and manner of believing, which is called the faith of GOD's elect. <HI>Tit.</HI> i. 1. There is a &s;piritual conviction of the truth, which is, a believing with the whole heart, peculi|ar to true &s;aints&mdash;of which I would &s;peak particularly by and by.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="17" REF="023344_0016_0FBF0785ADF88248">IV. It may be infer'd, from the doctrine which has been in&s;i&s;ted on, that 'tis no certain &s;ign, that per&s;ons are &s;avingly converted; that they have been &s;uBjects of very great di&s;tre&s;s and terrors of mind, through appre|hen&s;ions of GOD's wrath, and fears of damnation.</P>
<P>That the Devils are the &s;ubjects of great terrors, through apprehen&s;ions of GOD's wrath, and fears of future effects of it, is implied in my text; which &s;peaks not only of their <HI>believing,</HI> but <HI>trembling.</HI> It mu&s;t be no &s;mall degree of terror, which &s;hould make tho&s;e principalities and powers, tho&s;e mighty, proud and &s;turdy beings, to tremble.</P>
<P>There are many terrors, that &s;ome per&s;ons, who are concerned for their &s;alvation, are the &s;ubjects of, which are not from any proper awakenings of con&s;cience, or ap|prehen&s;ions of truth; but from melancholy, or frightful impre&s;&s;ions on their imagination; or &s;ome groundle&s;s ap|prehen&s;ions, and the delu&s;ions, and fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions of Satan. But if they have had never &s;o great, and long continued terrors, from real awakenings, and convicti|ons of truth, and views of things as they are; this is no more than what is in the Devils, and will be in all wicked men, in another world. However &s;tupid and &s;en&s;ele&s;s mo&s;t ungodly men are now, all will be effectually awak|ened at la&s;t: There will be no &s;uch thing as &s;lumbering in Hell. There are many that cannot be awaken'd by the mo&s;t &s;olemn warnings, and awful threatnings of the word of GOD; the mo&s;t alarming di&s;cour&s;es from the pulpit, and the mo&s;t awakening and awful providences; but all will be thoroughly awaken'd, by the &s;ound of the la&s;t trumpet, and the appearance of CHRIST to Judg|ment; and all &s;orts will then be fill'd with mo&s;t amazing terrors, from apprehen&s;ions of truth, and &s;eeing things as they be; when <HI>the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men,</HI> (&s;uch as were the mo&s;t lofty and &s;touthearted, mo&s;t ready to treat the things of Religion with contempt) <HI>&s;hall hide them&s;elves in the dens, and in the rocks of the

<P>Therefore, if per&s;ons have fir&s;t been awakened, and then afterwards have had comfort and joy, 'tis no cer|tain &s;ign, that their comforts are of the right kind, that they were preceded by very great terrors.</P>
<P N="5">V. It may be further infer'd from the doctrine, that no work of the law on men's hearts, in conviction of Guilt, and ju&s;t de&s;ert of puni&s;hment, is a &s;ure argument, that a per&s;on has been &s;avingly converted.</P>
<P>Not only, are no awakenings and terrors, any certain evidence of this, but no meer legal work what&s;oever; tho' carried to the utmo&s;t extent that it can be; nothing wherein there is no grace or &s;piritual light, but only the meer conviction of natural con&s;cience, and tho&s;e acts and operations of the mind, which are the re&s;ult of this; and &s;o are, as it were, meerly forced by the clear light of con|&s;cience, without the concurrence of the heart and inclina|tion with that light: I &s;ay the&s;e things are no certain &s;ign of the &s;aving grace of GOD, or that a per&s;on was ever &s;avingly converted.</P>
<P>The evidence of this, from my text and doctrine, is demon&s;trative; becau&s;e the Devils are the &s;ubjects of the&s;e things; and all wicked men that &s;hall finally peri&s;h, will be the &s;ubjects of the &s;ame. Natural con&s;ciene is not extingui&s;hed in the damned in Hell; but on the contra|ry, remains, and is there in it's greate&s;t &s;trength, and is brought to it's mo&s;t perfect exerci&s;e; mo&s;t fully to do its proper office, as GOD's vicegerent in the &s;oul, to con|demn tho&s;e rebels again&s;t the king of heaven and earth, and manife&s;t GOD's ju&s;t wrath and vengeance, and by that means to torment them; and be as a never-dying worm within them.

Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not &s;ee: But they &s;hall &s;ee, and be a&s;hamed for their envy at the people; yea the &s;ire of thine enemies &s;hall devour them.</HI> We have this expre&s;&s;i|on often annexed to GOD's threatnings of wrath to his enemies; <HI>and they &s;hall know, that I am the Lord:</HI> This &s;hall be accompli&s;hed by their woful experience, and clear light in their con&s;ciences, whereby they &s;hall be made to know, whether they will or not; how great and ter|rible, holy and righteous a GOD <HI>JEHOVAH</HI> is; who&s;e authority they have de&s;pi&s;ed: And they &s;hall know, that he is righteous and holy in their de&s;truction. This all the ungodly will be convinced of, at the day of Judgment, by the bringing to light all their wickedne&s;s of heart and practice; and &s;etting all their &s;ins, with all their aggra|vations, in order, not only in the view of others, even of the whole world, but in the view of their own con&s;ciences. This is threaten'd, <HI>P&s;.</HI> 50.21. <HI>The&s;e things ha&s;t thou done, and I kept &s;ilence: Thou thoughte&s;t that I was altogether &s;uch an one as thy&s;elf. But I will reprove thee, and &s;et them in order before thine eyes.</HI> Compare this with the four fir&s;t ver&s;es of the P&s;alm.&mdash;The end of the day of Judgment, si not <HI>to find out what is ju&s;t</HI>; as it is with human judg|ment, but it is <HI>to manifest what is just</HI>; to make known GOD's ju&s;tice in the judgment which he will execute, to men's own con&s;ciences, and to the world. And therefore, that day is called <HI>the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of</HI> GOD. <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 5. Now &s;inners often cavil again&s;t the ju&s;tice of GOD's di&s;pen&s;ations, and particular|ly, the ju&s;tice of the puni&s;hment, which GOD threatens for their &s;ins; excu&s;ing them&s;elves, and condemning GOD:
<PB N="20" REF="023344_0019_0FBF078938FD37D8">
But when GOD comes to manife&s;t their wickedne&s;s in the light of that day, and to call them to an account, they will be &s;peechle&s;s; <HI>Matt.</HI> xxii. 11, 12. <HI>And when the king came to &s;ee the gue&s;ts, he &s;aw there, a man which had not on a wedding garment: And he &s;aith unto him, friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding garment? and he was &s;peechle&s;s.</HI> When the king of Heaven and earth comes to judgment, their con&s;ciences will be &s;o perfectly enlighten'd and convinced, by the all &s;earching light, they &s;hall then &s;tand in; that their mouths will be effectually &s;topped, as to all excu&s;es for them&s;elves&punc; all pleading of their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, to excu&s;e or ju&s;tify them; and all objections again&s;t the ju&s;tice of their judge; that their con&s;cience will condemn them only, and not GOD.</P>
<P>Therefore, it follows from the doctrine, that it can be no certain &s;ign of grace, that per&s;ons have had great con|victions of &s;in; have had their &s;ins of life, with their ag|gravations remarkably &s;et before them, &s;o as greatly to affect and terrify them; and withal, have had a great &s;ight of the wickedne&s;s of their hearts, and been convinc|ed of the greatne&s;s of the &s;in of unbelief, and of the un|excu&s;eablene&s;s and heinou&s;ne&s;s of their mo&s;t &s;ecret &s;piritual iniquities; and have been brought to be convinced of the uttter in&s;ufficiency of their own righteou&s;ne&s;s; and to de&s;pair of being recommended to GOD by it; have been as much brought off from their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, as ever any are, under a meer legal humiliation; have been con|vinced that they are wholly without excu&s;e before GOD, and de&s;erve damnation; and that GOD would be ju&s;t, in executing the threaten'd puni&s;hment upon them, tho' it be &s;o dreadful. All the&s;e things, will be in all the un|godly at the day of judgment, when they &s;hall &s;tand with Devils, at the left hand, and &s;hall be doomed as accur&s;|ed, to everla&s;ting fire, with them.</P>
<P>Indeed there will be no &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in them. Their con&s;cience will be fully convinced, that GOD is ju&s;t in their condemnation; but yet their wills will not be bowed

to GOD's ju&s;tice. There will be no acquie&s;cence of mind, in that divine attribute; no yielding of the &s;oul to GOD's &s;overeignty, but the highe&s;t degree of enmity and op|po&s;ition. A true &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the heart and will, to the ju&s;tice and &s;overeignty of GOD, is therefore allowed to be &s;omething peculiar to true converts, being &s;omething which the Devils and damned &s;ouls are, and ever will be far from; and which a meer work of the law, and convicti|ons of con&s;cience, however great and clear, will never bring men to.</P>
<P>When &s;inners are the &s;ubjects of great convictions of con&s;cience, and a remarkable work of the law; 'tis only a tran&s;acting the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day of Judgment, in the con&s;cience before hand: GOD &s;its enthroned in the con|&s;cience, as at the la&s;t day he will &s;it enthron'd in the cloud of heaven; the &s;inner is arraigned, as it were, at GOD's bar; and GOD appears in his awful greatne&s;s, as a ju&s;t and holy, &s;in-hating and &s;in revenging GOD, as he will then. The &s;inners iniquities are brought to light; his &s;ins &s;et in order before him; the hidden things of dark|ne&s;s, and the coun&s;els of the heart are made manife&s;t; as it will be then: Many witne&s;&s;es do, as it were, ri&s;e up again&s;t the &s;inner under convictions of con&s;cience; as they will again&s;t the wicked at the day of judgment: And the books are open'd, particularly the book of GOD's &s;trict and holy law, is open'd in the con&s;cience, and its rules applied for the condemnation of the &s;inner; which is the book that will be open'd at the day of Judgment, as the grand rule of Judgment, to all &s;uch wicked men as have lived under it: And the &s;entence of the law is pronounc|ed again&s;t the &s;inner; and the ju&s;tice of the &s;entence made manife&s;t; as it will be at the day of Judgment. The conviction of a &s;inner at the day of Judgment, will be a work of the law, as well as the conviction of con&s;cience in this world&punc; And the work of the law (if the work be <HI>meerly legal)</HI> be &s;ure, is never carried further in the con|&s;ciences of &s;inners now, than it will be at that day, when it's work will be perfect, in thoroughly &s;topping the &s;in|ner's

mouth. <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 19. <HI>Now we know, that what things &s;oever the law &s;aith, it &s;aith to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be|come guilty before GOD.</HI> Every mouth &s;hall be &s;topped by the law, either now or hereafter; and all the world &s;hall become &s;en&s;ibly guilty before GOD; guilty of death, de&s;erving of damnation.&mdash;And therefore, if &s;inners have been the &s;ubjects of a great work of the law, and have thus become guilty, and their mouths have been &s;topp'd; it is no certain &s;ign that ever they have been converted.</P>
<P>Indeed the want of a thorough &s;en&s;e of guilt, and de|&s;ert of puni&s;hment, and conviction of the ju&s;tice of GOD, in threatning damnation, is a good negative &s;ign; 'tis a &s;ign that a per&s;on <HI>never was</HI> converted, and truly brought, with the whole &s;oul, to embrace CHRIST as a Saviour from this puni&s;hment: For 'tis ea&s;ily demon&s;trable, that there is no &s;uch thing as entirely and cordially accepting an offer from GOD, of a Saviour, from a puni&s;hment that he threat|ens, which we think we don't de&s;erve. But the having &s;uch a conviction, is no certain &s;ign, that per&s;ons have true faith, or have ever truly received CHRIST as their Saviour. And if per&s;ons have great comfort, joy, and confidence, &s;uddenly let into their minds, after great convictions, of &s;uch a kind as has been mention'd; 'tis no infalliable evi|dence that their comforts are built on a good foundation.</P>
<P>'Tis manife&s;t, therefore, that too much &s;tre&s;s has been laid by many per&s;ons, on a great work of the law, pre|ceding their comforts: Who &s;eem not only to have look'd on &s;uch a work of the law, as nece&s;&s;ary to precede faith, but al&s;o to have e&s;teem'd it as the chief evidence of the truth and genuinene&s;s of &s;ucceeding faith and comforts. By this means it is to be fear'd, very many have been de|ceiv'd, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd in a fal&s;e hope. And what is to be &s;een in the event of things, in multitudes of in&s;tances, confirms this. It may be &s;afely allowed, not to be &s;o u&s;ual for great convictions of con&s;cience, to prove abor|tive, and fail of a good i&s;&s;ue, as for le&s;&s;er convictions;
<PB N="23" REF="023344_0022_0FBF07A8DADC7ED0">
and that more generally, when the &s;pirit of GOD proceeds &s;o far with &s;inners, in the work of the law, as to give 'em a great &s;ight of their hearts, and of the heinou&s;ne&s;s of their &s;piritual iniquities; and to convince 'em that they are without excu&s;e; and that all their righteou&s;ne&s;s can do nothing to merit GOD's favours; but that they lie ju&s;tly expo&s;ed to GOD's eternal vengeance without mercy; a work of &s;aving conver&s;ion follows. But we can have no warrant to &s;ay, it is univer&s;ally &s;o, or to lay it down as an infallible rule, that when convictions of con&s;cience have gone thus far, &s;aving faith, and repentance will &s;ure|ly follow. If any &s;hould think they have ground for &s;uch a determination, becau&s;e they can't conceive what end GOD &s;hould have, in carrying a work of conviction to &s;uch a length, and &s;o preparing the heart for faith; and after all, never giving &s;aving faith to the &s;oul; I de&s;ire it may be con&s;idered, where will be the end of our doubts and difficulties, if we think our&s;elves &s;ufficient to determine, &s;o po&s;itively and particularly concerning GOD's ends and de&s;igns in what he does. It may be a&s;ked &s;uch an ob|jector, what is GOD's end in giving a &s;inner <HI>any degree</HI> of the &s;trivings of his &s;pirit, and conviction of con&s;cience; when he afterwards &s;uffers it to come to nothing, and to prove in vain? If he may give &s;ome degree that may finally be in vain; who &s;hall &s;et the bounds, and &s;ay how great the degree &s;hall be? Who can, on &s;ure grounds, determine, that when a &s;inner has &s;o much of that con|viction, which the Devils and damned in hell have; true faith and eternal &s;alvation, will be the certain con&s;e|quence. This we may certainly determine, that, if the Apo&s;tle's argument in the text be good, not any thing what&s;oever, that the Devils have, is certainly connected with &s;uch a con&s;equence. Seeing &s;inners, while &s;uch, are capable of the mo&s;t perfect convictions, and will have them at the day of Judgment, and in Hell; who &s;hall &s;ay, that GOD never &s;hall cau&s;e reprobates to anticipate the future Judgment and damnation in that re&s;pect?

if he does &s;o, who &s;hall &s;ay to him, what doe&s;t thou? Or call him to account concerning his ends in &s;o doing.

<P>And let it be con&s;idered, where is our warrant in &s;crip|ture, to make u&s;e of any legal convictions, or any me|thod or order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive events in a work of the law; and con&s;equent comforts, as a &s;ure &s;ign of regeneration&punc; The &s;cripture is abundant, in expre&s;sly mentioning evi|dences of grace, and of a &s;tate of favour with GOD, and characteri&s;ticks of the true &s;aints: But where do we ever find &s;uch things as the&s;e, among&s;t tho&s;e evidences? Or where do we find any other &s;igns in&s;i&s;ted on, be&s;ides grace it&s;elf, it's nature, exerci&s;es and fruits? The&s;e were the evidences that <HI>Job</HI> relied upon; The&s;e were the things that the P&s;almi&s;t, every were in&s;i&s;ts upon, as evi|dences of his &s;incerity: And particularly in the cxix P&s;alm, from the beginning to the end. The&s;e were the &s;igns that <HI>Hezekiah</HI> tru&s;ted to, in his &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the characteri&s;ticks given of tho&s;e that are truly happy, by our &s;aviour, in the beginning of his &s;er|mon in the mount. The&s;e are the things that CHRIST mentions, at the true evidences of being his real di&s;ciples, in his la&s;t, and dying di&s;cour&s;e to his di&s;ciples, in the
<PB N="25" REF="023344_0024_0FBF07AC33F3D1E8">
xiv. xv. and xvi. Chapters of <HI>John</HI>; and in his interce&s;&s;ary prayer, Chap. xvii. The&s;e are the things which the Apo&s;tle Paul often &s;peaks of, as evidences of his &s;ince|rity, and &s;ure title to a crown of glory. And the&s;e are the things he often mentions to others, in his epi&s;tles, as the proper evidences of real chri&s;tianity; a ju&s;tified &s;tate, and a title to glory. He in&s;i&s;ts on the <HI>fruits of the &s;pirit; love, joy, peace, long &s;uffering, gentlene&s;s, goodne&s;s, faith, meekne&s;s, temperance,</HI> as the proper evidences of <HI>being</HI> CHRIST's, and <HI>living in the &s;pirit:</HI> Gal. v. 22.&mdash;25. 'Tis that <HI>Charity,</HI> or divine love, <HI>which is pure, peaceable, gen|tle, ea&s;y to be intreated, full of mercy, &amp;c.</HI> that he in&s;i&s;ts on, as the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential evidence of true Godline&s;s; without which, all other things are nothing. Such are the &s;igns which the Apo&s;tle James in&s;i&s;ts on, as the pro|per evidence, of a truly wi&s;e and good man: Jam. iii 17. <HI>The wi&s;dom that is from above, is fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, gentle, ea&s;y to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocri&s;y.</HI> And &s;uch are the &s;igns of true Chri&s;tianity, which the Apo&s;tle John in|&s;i&s;ts on, throughout his epi&s;tles. And we never have any where in the Bible, from the beginning to the end of it, any other &s;igns of Godline&s;s given, than &s;uch as the&s;e. If per&s;ons have &s;uch things as the&s;e apparently in them, it ought to be determin'd, that they are truly con|verted, without its being in&s;i&s;ted, that it be fir&s;t known, what &s;teps or method the &s;pirit of GOD took, to intro|duce the&s;e things into the &s;oul; which often times, is al|together untraceable. All the works of GOD, are in &s;ome re&s;pects, un&s;earchable: But the Scripture, repre&s;ents the works of the &s;pirit of GOD, as peculiarly &s;o; I&s;ai. xl. 13. <HI>Who hath directed</HI> the &s;pirit of the Lord, <HI>or being his coun|&s;ellor, hath taught him?</HI> Ecle&s;. xi. 5. <HI>As thou knowe&s;t not what is the way of</HI> the &s;pirit; <HI>nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child, &s;o thou knowest not the works of GOD, who maketh all.</HI> John iii. 8. <HI>The wind bloweth where it li&s;teth; and thou hearest the &s;ound thereof;
<PB N="26" REF="023344_0025_0FBF07AE88F49658">
but can&s;t not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; &s;o is every one that is born of</HI> the &s;pirit.</P>
<P N="6">VI. It follows from my text and doctrine, that it is no certain &s;ign of grace, that per&s;ons have earne&s;t de&s;ires and longings after &s;alvation.</P>
<P>The Devils, doubtle&s;s, long for deliverance from the mi&s;ery they &s;uffer, and from that greater mi&s;ery which they expect. If they tremble through fear of it, they mu&s;t, nece&s;&s;arily, earne&s;tly de&s;ire to be delivered from it. Wicked men, are in &s;cripture, repre&s;ented as longing for the privileges of the righteous, when the door is &s;hut, and they are &s;hut out from among them: They come to the door, and cry, <HI>Lord, Lord, open to us.</HI> Therefore, we are not to look on all de&s;ires, or all de&s;ires that are very earne&s;t and vehement, as certain evidences of a pi|ous heart. There are earne&s;t de&s;ires of a religious nature, which the &s;aints have, that are the proper breathings of a new nature, and di&s;tingui&s;hing qualities of true &s;aints: But there are al&s;o longings, which unregenerate men may have, which are often mi&s;taken for marks of Godline&s;s: They think they hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s; and have earne&s;t de&s;ires after GOD and CHRIST, and long for Heaven; when indeed, all is to be re&s;olved into de|&s;ires of &s;alvation, from &s;elf-love; and &s;o is a longing which ari&s;es from no higher principles, than the earne&s;t de&s;ires of Devils.</P>
<P N="7">VII. It may be infer'd from what has been ob&s;erved; that per&s;ons who have no grace, may have a great ap|prehen&s;ion of an external glory, in things heavenly and di|vine; and of what&s;oever is external, pertaining to things of Religon.</P>
<P>If per&s;ons have impre&s;s'd &s;trongly on their minds, ideas of that &s;ort, which are obtain'd by the external &s;en&s;es; whether they are of that kind that enter by the ear, as any kind of &s;ound; whether it be the mo&s;t plea&s;ant mu|&s;ick, or words &s;poken of excellent &s;ignification; words of &s;cripture, or any other, immediately &s;ugge&s;ted, as
<PB N="27" REF="023344_0026_0FBF07B0B3029FD0">
tho' they were &s;poken, tho' they &s;eem to be never &s;o &s;uit|able to their ca&s;e, or adapted to the &s;ubject of their me|ditations: Or whether they are of that kind, that are ob|tained by the eye, as ideas of a vi&s;ible beauty and glory; a &s;hining light, an external glory of Heaven; golden &s;treets, walls and gates of precious &s;tone; &s;plendid Pa|laces; glorious inhabitants, &s;hining forth as the &s;un; a mo&s;t magnificent throne, &s;urrounded by angels and &s;aints, in &s;hining ranks: Or any thing external, belonging to JESUS CHRIST; either in his humbled &s;tate, as of JESUS hanging on the cro&s;s with his crown of thorns, his wounds open, and blood trickling down; or in his glori|fied &s;tate, with awful maje&s;ty, or ravi&s;hing beauty and &s;weetne&s;s in his countenance; his face &s;hining above the brightne&s;s of the &s;un, and the like: The&s;e things are no certain &s;igns of grace.</P>
<P>Multitudes that are now in Hell, will have ideas of the external glory, that pertains to things heavenly, far beyond what ever any have in this world. They will &s;ee all that external glory and beauty, in which CHRIST will appear at the day of Judgment, when the &s;un &s;hall be turned into darkne&s;s before him; which, doubtle&s;s, will be ten thou&s;and times greater than ever was impre&s;&s;|ed on the imagination of either &s;aints or &s;inners, in this pre&s;ent &s;tate, or ever was conceived by any mortal man.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. It may be infer'd from the doctrine, that per|&s;ons who have no grace, may have a very great and af|fecting &s;en&s;e of many divine things in their hearts.</P>
<P>The Devil has not only great &s;peculative knowledge, but he has a &s;en&s;e of many divine things, which deeply affects him, and is mo&s;t &s;trongly impre&s;s'd on his heart. As</P>
<P N="1">1. The Devils and damned &s;ouls, have a great &s;en&s;e of the <HI>vast importance</HI> of the things of another world. They are <HI>in</HI> the invi&s;ible world, and they &s;ee and know how great the things of that world are: Their experience teaches 'em in the mo&s;t affecting manner. They have a
<PB N="28" REF="023344_0027_0FBF07B2D8465B00">
great &s;en&s;e of the worth of &s;alvation, and the worth of immortal &s;ouls, and the va&s;t importance of tho&s;e things, that concern men's eternal welfare. The parable in the latter end of the xvi. Chap. of Luke, teaches this, in re|pre&s;enting the <HI>rich man</HI> in Hell, as intreating that <HI>Lazarus</HI> might be &s;ent <HI>to his five brothers, to testify unto them, less they &s;hould come to that place of torment.</HI> They who endure the torments of Hell, have, doubtle&s;s, a mo&s;t lively and affecting &s;en&s;e of the va&s;tne&s;s of an endle&s;s eternity; and of the comparative momentarine&s;s of this life, and the vanity of the concerns and enjoyments of time. They are convinced effectually, that all the things of this world, even tho&s;e that appear greate&s;t and mo&s;t important to the inhabitants of the earth, are de&s;picable trifles, in com|pari&s;on of the things of the eternal world. They have a great &s;en&s;e of the preciou&s;ne&s;s of time, and of the means of grace, and the ine&s;timable value of the privileges which they enjoy, which live under the go&s;pel. They are fully &s;en&s;ible of the folly of tho&s;e that go on in &s;in; neglect their opportunities; make light of the coun&s;els and warn|ings of GOD; and bitterly lament their exceeding folly, in their own &s;ins; by which they have brought on them|&s;elves &s;o great and remedile&s;s mi&s;ery. When &s;inners, by woful experience, know the dreadful i&s;&s;ue of their evil way; they will <HI>mourn at the last, &s;aying, how have I hat|ed in&s;truction, and my heart de&s;pi&s;ed reproof, and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that in&s;tructed me!</HI> Prov. iv. 11, 12, 13.</P>
<P>Therefore, however, true Godline&s;s is now attended with a great &s;en&s;e of the importance of divine things; and 'tis rare, that men that have no grace, do maintain &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, in any &s;teady and per&s;evering manner; yet 'tis manife&s;t, tho&s;e things are no certain evidences of grace. Unregenerate men may have a &s;en&s;e of the importance of of the things of eternity, and the vanity of things of time; the work of immortal &s;ouls; the preciou&s;ne&s;s of time and means of grace, and the folly of the way of allowed &s;in;
<PB N="29" REF="023344_0028_0FBF07B475E53208">
And may have &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e things, as may deep|ly affect them, and cau&s;e 'em to mourn for their own &s;ins, and be much concerned for others. Tho' it be true, they have not the&s;e things in the &s;ame manner, and in all re&s;pects, from the &s;ame principles and views, as god|ly men have them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Devils and damned men, have a &s;trong and mo&s;t affecting &s;en&s;e of the awful <HI>greatne&s;s</HI> and <HI>maje&s;ty</HI> of GOD. The awful maje&s;ty of GOD, are greatly made manife&s;t in the execution of divine wrath, which they are the &s;ub|jects of. The making this known, is one thing GOD has in de&s;ign, in his vengeance on his enemies. Rom. ix. 22. <HI>What, if</HI> GOD <HI>willing to &s;hew his wrath&punc; and to make his power known, endured with much long &s;uffering the ve&s;&s;els of wrath, fitted to destruction?</HI> The Devils tremble before this <HI>great and terrible</HI> GOD, and under a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of his <HI>awful maje&s;ty.</HI> 'Tis greatly manife&s;ted to them, and damned &s;ouls now; but &s;hall be manife&s;ted in a further degree, in <HI>that day, when the Lord Je&s;us &s;halt be revealed from Heaven, in flaming fire, to take vengeance upon them</HI>; and when they &s;hall earne&s;tly de&s;ire to fly, and <HI>be hid from the face of him that &s;its on the throne, (which &s;hall be, be|cau&s;e of the glory of his maje&s;ty.</HI> I&s;ai. ii. 10.) and when they <HI>&s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction, from the pre|&s;ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</HI> When CHRIST <HI>comes,</HI> at the la&s;t day, <HI>in the glory of his Father, every eye &s;hall &s;ee him</HI> in that glory, (in this re&s;pect, that they &s;hall &s;ee his terrible maje&s;ty) and they al&s;o that pierced him: Rev. i. 7. Both tho&s;e Devils, and wicked men, which tormented and in&s;ulted him, when he ap|peared in meanne&s;s and ignominy, &s;hall then &s;ee him in the glory of his father.</P>
<P>'Tis evident, therefore, that a &s;en&s;e of GOD's terrible maje&s;ty, is no certain evidence of &s;aving grace: For we &s;ee that wicked men, and Devils are capable of it: Yea, many wicked men in this world have actually had it. This is a manife&s;tation, which GOD made of him&s;elf, in
<PB N="30" REF="023344_0029_0FBF07EAB921E678">
the &s;ight of that wicked congregation at <HI>Mount Sinai,</HI> which they &s;aw, and were deeply affected with; <HI>&s;o that all the people that were in the camp trembled.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Devils and damned men have &s;ome kind of convic|tion and &s;en&s;e of all the attributes of GOD, both natural and moral, that is &s;trong and very affecting.</P>
<P>The Devils know GOD's <HI>almighty power</HI>: They &s;aw a great manife&s;tation of it, when they &s;aw GOD lay the foundation of the earth <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and were much affected with it. And they have &s;een innumerable other great de|mon&s;trations of his power; as in the univer&s;al deluge, the de&s;truction of Sodom, the wonders in Egypt, at the red &s;ea, and in the wilderne&s;s; the cau&s;ing the &s;un to &s;tand &s;till in <HI>Jo&s;hua's</HI> time; and many others. And they had a very affecting manife&s;tation of GOD's mighty power on them&s;elves, in ca&s;ting all their ho&s;ts down from Heav|en into Hell; and have continual affecting experience of it, in GOD's re&s;erving them in &s;trong chains of darkne&s;s, and in the &s;trong pains they feel; and will hereafter, have far more affecting experience of it, when <HI>they &s;hall be pun|i&s;hed from the glory of</HI> GOD's <HI>power,</HI> with that mighty de|&s;truction, which they now tremble in expectation of. So the Devils have a great knowledge of the <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> of GOD: They have had un&s;peakably, more opportunity and oc|ca&s;ion to ob&s;erve it, in the work of creation, and al&s;o in the works of providence, than any mortal man has ever had; and have been them&s;elves the &s;ubjects of innume|rable affecting manife&s;tations of it, in GOD's di&s;appoint|ing and confounding them in their mo&s;t &s;ubtil devices, in &s;o wonderful and amazing a manner. So they &s;ee and find the <HI>infinite purity and holine&s;s</HI> of the divine nature, in the mo&s;t affecting manner, as this appears in his infinite hatred of &s;in, in what they feel of the dreadful effects of that hatred. They know already, by what they &s;uffer, and will know hereafter to a greater degree, and far more affecting manner, that &s;uch is the oppo&s;ition of GOD's nature to &s;in, that it is like a con&s;uming fire, that burns
<PB N="31" REF="023344_0030_0FBF07F82A165A60">
with infinite vehemence again&s;t it: They will feel the vehement heat of that fire, in a very dreadful manner. They al&s;o will &s;ee the holine&s;s of GOD, as exerci&s;ed in his love to righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s, in what they will &s;ee of the reward of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST, in the ho|line&s;s of his people, in the glory of CHRIST and his church; which al&s;o will be very affecting to Devils, and wicked men. And the <HI>exact ju&s;tice</HI> of GOD, will be manife&s;ted to them in the cleare&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t, mo&s;t convincing and mo&s;t affecting light, at the day of Judgment. When they will al&s;o &s;ee great and affecting demon&s;trations of the riches of his Grace, in the marvellous fruits of his love to the ve&s;&s;els of mercy; when they &s;hall &s;ee them at the right hand of CHRIST, &s;hining as the &s;un, in the king|dom of their father, and &s;hall hear the ble&s;&s;ed &s;entence pronounced upon them; and will be deeply affected with it; as &s;eems naturally implied in the xiii. Chap. of Luke, 28, 29, ver&s;es. The Devils know GOD's <HI>Truth</HI>; and therefore, they believe his threatnings, and tremble in expectation of their accompli&s;hment. And wicked men that now doubt his truth, and dare not tru&s;t his word, will hereafter, in the mo&s;t convincing, affecting manner, find his word to be true, in all that he has threatened; and will &s;ee that he is faithful to his promi&s;es, in the re|wards of his &s;aints. Devils and damned men, know that GOD is <HI>eternal</HI> and <HI>unchangeable</HI>; and therefore, they de&s;|pair of there ever being an end to their mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Therefore 'tis manife&s;t, that meerly Per&s;ons having an affecting &s;en&s;e of &s;ome, or even of all GOD's attributes, it is no certain &s;ign, that they have the true Grace of GOD in their Hearts.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> Here po&s;&s;ibly, &s;ome may object again&s;t the force of the foregoing rea&s;oning. That ungodly Men in this World, are in exceeding different circum&s;tances, from tho&s;e which the Devils are in; and from tho&s;e which wicked men will be in, at the day of Judgment. Tho&s;e things which are vi&s;ible and pre&s;ent to the&s;e, are
<PB N="32" REF="023344_0031_0FBF07FA98E9EE00">
now future and invi&s;ible to the other. And wicked men in this world, are in the body, that clogs and hinders the &s;oul, and are encompa&s;&s;ed with objects that blind and &s;tupify 'em. And therefore, it don't follow&punc; that, be|cau&s;e the wicked in another world, have a great appre|hen&s;ion and lively &s;en&s;e of &s;uch and &s;uch things, without grace, that ungodly men, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate may have the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> To this I an&s;wer: 'Tis not &s;uppo&s;ed, that ever men in this life have all tho&s;e things which have been menti|oned, to the &s;ame degree that the Devils and damned have them. None &s;uppo&s;es that ever any in this life have ter|rors of con&s;cience to an equal degree with them. 'Tis not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that any mortal man, whether Godly or Ungodly, has an equal degree of &s;peculative knowledge with the Devil. And, as was ju&s;t now ob&s;erved, the wicked, at the day of Judgment, will have a va&s;tly great|er idea of the external glory of CHRIST, than ever any have in the pre&s;ent &s;tate. So, doubtle&s;s, they will have a far greater &s;en&s;e of GOD's awful greatne&s;s and terrible maje&s;ty, than any could &s;ub&s;i&s;t under in this frail &s;tate. So we may well conclude, that the Devils, and wicked men in Hell, have a greater and more affecting &s;en&s;e of the va&s;tne&s;s of eternity, and (in &s;ome re&s;pects) a greater &s;en&s;e of the importance of the things of another world, than any here have. And they have al&s;o longings after &s;alvati|on to an higher degree than any wicked men in this world.</P>
<P>But yet, it is evident, that men in this world, may have things of <HI>the &s;ame kind</HI> with Devils and damned men. The &s;ame &s;ort of light in the under&s;tanding; the &s;ame views, and the &s;ame affections; the &s;ame &s;en&s;e of things, the &s;ame kind of impre&s;&s;ions on the mind, and on the heart. If the objection is again&s;t the conclu&s;ivene&s;s of the rea&s;on|ing that has been made u&s;e of to prove this; 'tis again&s;t the conclu&s;ivene&s;s of that rea&s;oning which is the Apo&s;|tle's, more properly than mine. The Apo&s;tle judged it, a conclu&s;ive argument, again&s;t &s;uch as thought their <HI>believing
<PB N="33" REF="023344_0032_0FBF07FBAF336790">
there was one</HI> GOD, an evidence of their being gracious,; that the Devils believed the &s;ame. So the argument is exactly the &s;ame, again&s;t &s;uch as think they have grace, becau&s;e they believe GOD is a <HI>holy</HI> GOD, or becau&s;e they have a &s;en&s;e of the <HI>awful maje&s;ty</HI> of GOD. The &s;ame may be ob&s;erved of other things that have been mentioned. My text has reference not only to the act of the under|&s;tandings of Devils in believing, but to that affection of their hearts, which accompanies the views they have: As <HI>trembling</HI> is an effect of the affection of the heart. Which &s;hews, that if men have both the &s;ame views of under&s;tanding, and al&s;o the &s;ame affections of heart, that the Devils have, it is no &s;ign of grace.</P>
<P>And as to the particular degree, to which the&s;e things may be carried in men, in this world, without grace; it appears not to be &s;afe, to go about &s;o to a&s;certain and fix it, as to make u&s;e of it as an infallible rule to determine men's &s;tate. I know not where we have any rule to go by, to fix the preci&s;e degree, in which GOD by his pro|vidence, or his common influence on the mind, will ex|cite in wicked men in this world, the &s;ame views and af|fections, which the wicked have in another world; which 'tis manife&s;t, the former are capable as well as the latter, having the &s;ame faculties and principles of &s;oul; and which views and affections, it is evident, they often are actually the &s;ubjects of in &s;ome degree; &s;ome in a great|er, and &s;ome in a le&s;s degree. The infallible evidences of grace, which are laid down in &s;cripture, are of another kind: They are all of a holy and &s;piritual nature; and therefore, things of that kind, which a heart that is wholly carnal and corrupt, cannot receive, or have any experience of. 1. Cor. ii. 14.</P>
<P>I might al&s;o here add, that ob&s;ervation and experience, in very many in&s;tances, &s;eems to confirm what &s;cripture and rea&s;on teaches in the&s;e things.</P>
<P>The &s;econd USE may be of <HI>&s;elf-examination.</HI></P>
<P>Let the things which have been ob&s;erved, put all on
<PB N="34" REF="023344_0033_0FBF07FD372DC350">
examining them&s;elves, and enquiring whether they have any better evidences of &s;aving grace, than &s;uch as have been mentioned.</P>
<P>We &s;ee how the infallible &s;pirit of GOD, in the text, plainly repre&s;ents the things the Devils are the &s;ubjects of, as no &s;ure &s;ign of grace. And we have now, in &s;ome in&s;tances, ob&s;erved how far the Devils, and damned men go, and will go in their experience, their knowledge of divine things, their belief of truth, their awakenings and and terrors of con&s;cience, their conviction of guilt, and of the ju&s;tice of GOD, in their eternal, dreadful damnati|on, their longings after &s;alvation, their &s;ight of the external glory of CHRIST, and heavenly things; their &s;en&s;e of the va&s;t importance of the things of Religion, and another world; their &s;en&s;e of the awful greatne&s;s and terrible maje&s;ty of GOD, yea, of all GOD's attributes. The&s;e things may well put us on &s;erious &s;elf-examination, whether we have any thing to evidence our good e&s;tate, beyond what the Devils are the &s;ubjects of CHRIST &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, <HI>except your right|eou&s;ne&s;s exceed the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, ye &s;hall in no ca&s;e, enter into the kingdom of Heaven:</HI> So the &s;pirit of CHRIST, in his Apo&s;tle James, does in effect, &s;ay, in my text, except what ye experience in your &s;ouls, go beyond the experiences of Devils, ye &s;hall, in no ca&s;e, enter into the kingdom of GOD.</P>
<P>Here, it may be, &s;ome will be ready to &s;ay, I have &s;omething be&s;ides all the&s;e things, which have been mentioned; I have things which the Devils have not, even <HI>love</HI> and <HI>joy.</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wer, you may have &s;omething <HI>be&s;ides</HI> the experien|ces of Devils, and yet, nothing <HI>beyond</HI> them.

divine things, and &s;uch a belief of them. 'Tis from the&s;e principles of natural under&s;tanding and &s;elf-love, as exerci&s;ed about their own di&s;po&s;itions and actions, and GOD as their judge, that they have <HI>natural con&s;cience</HI>; and have &s;uch convictions of con&s;cience, as have been &s;poken of. 'Tis from the&s;e principles, that they have &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the importance of the things of religion, and the eter|nal world, and &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">gings after &s;alvation. 'Tis from the joint exerci&s;e of the&s;e two principles, that they are &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the awful maje&s;ty of GOD, and of all the at|tributes of the divine nature, and &s;o greatly affected with them. And it is from the&s;e principles, join'd with ex|ternal &s;en&s;e, the wicked, at the day of Judgment, will have &s;o great an apprehen&s;ion <HI>of,</HI> and will be &s;o greatly affected <HI>by</HI> the external glory of CHRIST and his &s;aints. And that you have a kind of love or gratitude and joy, which Devils and damned men have not, may po&s;&s;ibly not ari&s;e from any other principles in your heart, differ|ent from the&s;e two, but only from the&s;e principles, as exerci&s;ed in different circum&s;tances. As for in&s;tance; your being a &s;ubject of the re&s;training grace of GOD, and being under circum&s;tances of hope, and the receipt of mercy. The natural under&s;tanding and &s;elf-love of De|vils, po&s;&s;ibly might affect them in the &s;ame manner, if they were in the &s;ame circum&s;tances. If your love to GOD, had it's fir&s;t &s;ource from nothing el&s;e than a &s;uppo&s;ed im|mediate divine witne&s;s, or any other &s;uppo&s;ed evidence, that CHRIST died for you in particular, and that GOD loves you; it &s;prings from no higher principles than &s;elf-love; which is a principle that reigns in the hearts of De|vils. Self-love is &s;ufficient, without grace, to cau&s;e men to love tho&s;e that love them, or that they imagine love them, and make much of them; <HI>Luke</HI> vi 32. <HI>For if ye love them which love you, what thank have you? For &s;inners al&s;o love tho&s;e that love them.</HI> And would not the hearts of devils be fill'd with great <HI>joy,</HI> if they, by any means, &s;hould take up a confident per&s;ua&s;ion that GOD had par|don'd

them, and was become their friend, and that they &s;hould be delivered from that wrath which they now are in trembling expectation of. If the Devils go &s;o far as you have heard, even in their circum&s;tances, being to|tally ca&s;t off, and given up to unre&s;train'd wickedne&s;s, be|ing without hope, knowing that GOD is, and ever will be their enemy, they &s;uffering his wrath without mercy: How far may we rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e they might go, in imitation of grace and pious experience, if they had the &s;ame degree of knowledge, as clear views, and as &s;trong conviction, under circum&s;tances of hope, and offers of mercy; and being the &s;ubjects of common grace, re|&s;training their corruptions, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting and exciting the natural principles of rea&s;on, con&s;cience, &amp;c. Such things as Devils are the &s;ubjects of; &s;uch great conviction of con&s;cience; &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the importance of eternal things; &s;uch affecting views of the awful majecty, great|ne&s;s, power, holine&s;s, ju&s;tice, and truth of GOD, and &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of his great grace to the &s;aints, if they, or any thing like 'em, &s;hould be in the heart of a &s;inner, in this world; at the &s;ame time that he, from &s;ome &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on his imagination, of CHRIST appearing to him, or <HI>&s;weet</HI> words &s;poken to him, or by &s;ome other means, has &s;uddenly, after great terrors, imbibed a &s;trong confidence, that now, this great GOD, is his friend and father, has relea&s;ed him from all the mi|&s;ery he feared, and has promi&s;ed him eternal happine&s;s: I &s;ay, &s;uch things would, doubtle&s;s, va&s;tly heighten his exta&s;y of joy, and rai&s;e the exerci&s;e of natural gratitude, (that principle from whence &s;inners love tho&s;e that love them) and would occa&s;ion a great imitation of many graces, in &s;trong exerci&s;es. Is it any wonder then, that multitudes under &s;uch a &s;ort of affection, are deceived?

from no higher principles than are in the minds and hearts of Devils; what are tho&s;e exerci&s;es and affections, that are of a higher nature, which I mu&s;t find in my heart, and which I may ju&s;tly look upon as &s;ure &s;igns of the &s;aving grace of GOD's &s;pirit?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I an&s;wer, tho&s;e exerci&s;es and affections which are good evidences of grace, differ from all that the Devils are the &s;ubjects of, and all that can ari&s;e from &s;uch prin|ciples as are in their hearts, in two things; <HI>viz.</HI> their <HI>foundation</HI> and their <HI>tendency.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. They differ in their <HI>foundation,</HI> or in that belonging to them, which is mo&s;t fundamental in them, and the foundation of all the re&s;t, which pertains to 'em; <HI>viz. An apprehen&s;ion, or &s;en&s;e of the &s;upreme holy beauty, and com|line&s;s of divine things, as they are in them&s;elves, or in their own nature.</HI></P>
<P>This the Devils, and damned in Hell are, and forever will be entirely de&s;titute of. This the Devils once had, while they &s;tood in their integrity; but this they wholly lo&s;t, when they fell: And this is the only thing that can be mention'd, pertaining to the Devil's apprehen&s;ion and &s;en&s;e of the divine being, that he did lo&s;e. Nothing el&s;e belonging to the knowledge of GOD, can be devi&s;ed, that he is de&s;titute of. It has been ob&s;erved, that there is no one attribute of the divine nature, but what he is &s;en&s;ible of, and knows, and has a &s;trong and very affecting con|viction of; and this I think is evident, and undeniable. But the &s;upreme beauty of the divine nature, he is alto|gether blind to: He &s;ees no more of it, than a man born perfectly blind does of colours. The great &s;ight he has of the attributes of GOD, gives him an idea, and &s;trong &s;en&s;e of his awful maje&s;ty, but no idea of his beauty and comline&s;s. Tho' he has &s;een &s;o much of GOD's wonder|ful works of power, wi&s;dom, holine&s;s, ju&s;tice and truth, and his wonderful works of grace to mankind, this &s;o many thou&s;and years, and has had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve them with the &s;tronge&s;t attention: Yet all &s;erves not to
<PB N="38" REF="023344_0037_0FBF082153F1BA68">
give him the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of his divine beauty. And tho' the Devils &s;hould continue to exerci&s;e their mighty pow|ers of mind, with the &s;tronge&s;t intention; and &s;hould take things in all po&s;&s;ible views, in every order and arrange|ment; yet they never will &s;ee this. So little akin, is the knowledge they have to this, that the great degrees of that knowledge, bring them no nearer to it. Yet, the more knowledge they have of GOD, of that kind, the more do they hate GOD. That wherein the beauty of the divine nature, does mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;t, viz. his holi|ne&s;s, or moral excellency, appears in their eyes furthe&s;t from beauty: 'Tis on that very account chiefly that he appears hateful to 'em. The more holine&s;s they &s;ee in him, the more hateful he appears: The greater their &s;ight is of his holine&s;s, the higher is their hatred of him rai&s;ed. And becau&s;e of their hatred of his holine&s;s, they hate him the <HI>more,</HI> the <HI>more</HI> they &s;ee of his other attri|butes. They would hate a holy being, whatever his other attributes were; but they hate &s;uch a holy being the wor&s;e, for his being infinitely wi&s;e, and infinitely power|ful, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> more than they would do, if they &s;aw in him le&s;s power, and le&s;s wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>The wicked, at the day of judgment, will &s;ee every thing el&s;e in CHRIST, but his beauty and amiablene&s;s. There is no one quality or property of his per&s;on, that can be thought of, but what will be &s;et before them, in the &s;tronge&s;t light at that day, but only &s;uch as con&s;i&s;t in this. They will &s;ee him coming in the clouds of Heaven, <HI>in power, and great glory, in the glory of his father.</HI> They will have that view of his external glory, which is va&s;tly be|yond what we can have any imagination of: And they will have the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t convincing demon&s;trations of all his attributes and perfections. They will have a &s;en&s;e of his great maje&s;ty, that will be, as it were, in|finitely affecting to them. They &s;hall be made to know effectually, <HI>that he is the Lord.</HI> They &s;hall &s;ee what he is, and what he does: His nature and works, &s;hall ap|pear in the &s;tronge&s;t view. But his holy and infinite beauty
<PB N="39" REF="023344_0038_0FBF0822B678C748">
and amiablene&s;s, which is all in all, and without which every other quality and property is nothing, and wor&s;e than nothing, they will &s;ee nothing of.</P>
<P>Therefore, 'tis a &s;ight or &s;en&s;e of this, that is the thing, wherein does fundamentally con&s;i&s;t, the difference between tho&s;e things in which the &s;aving grace of GOD's &s;pirit con|&s;i&s;ts, and the experiences of Devils and damned &s;ouls. This is the foundation of every thing el&s;e that is di&s;tin|gui&s;hing in true Chri&s;tian experience. This is the foun|dation of the faith of GOD's elect. This gives the mind a &s;aving belief of the truth of divine things. 'Tis a view of the excellency of the things exhibited in the go&s;pel, or &s;en&s;e of the divine beauty, and amiablene&s;s of the &s;cheme of doctrine there exhibited, that &s;avingly convin|ces the mind, that it is indeed divine, or of GOD. This account of the matter is plainly implied: 2. Cor. iv. 3, 4. <HI>But if our go&s;pel be hid, it is hid to them that are lo&s;t; in whom the GOD of this world hath blinded the minds of them that BELIEVE NOT; le&s;t the light of the glorious go&s;pel of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>who is the image of</HI> GOD, <HI>&s;hould &s;hine into them.</HI> And, v. 6. <HI>For</HI> GOD, <HI>who commandeth the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, hath &s;hined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of</HI> GOD, <HI>in the face of</HI> JESUS CHRIST. 'Tis very evident that a &s;aving belief of the go&s;|pel, is here &s;poken of by the Apo&s;tle, as ari&s;ing from a view of the divine glory or beauty of the things it exhib|its. 'Tis by this view, that the &s;oul of a true convert is enabled &s;avingly, to &s;ee the &s;ufficiency of CHRIST for his &s;alvation. He that has his eyes open'd to behold the di|vine, &s;uperlative beauty and loveline&s;s of JESUS CHRIST, is convinced of his &s;ufficiency, to &s;tand as a mediator be|tween him, a guilty, Hell-de&s;erving wretch, and an in|finitely holy GOD, in an exceeding different manner than ever he can be convinced by all the arguments that are made u&s;e of, by the excellent authors or preachers.</P>
<P>When he once comes to &s;ee CHRIST's divine loveline&s;s, he wonders no more that he is thought worthy by GOD the
<PB N="40" REF="023344_0039_0FBF08242E167E10">
father, to be accepted for the vile&s;t &s;inner. Now it is not difficult for him to conceive, how the blood of CHRIST &s;hould be e&s;teem'd by GOD &s;o precious, as to be worthy to be accepted as a compen&s;ation for the greate&s;t &s;ins. The &s;oul now properly &s;ees the preciou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST, and &s;o does properly &s;ee and under&s;tand the very ground and rea&s;on of his acceptablene&s;s to GOD, and the value GOD &s;ets on his blood, obedience and interce&s;&s;ion. This &s;atisfies the poor guilty &s;oul, and gives it re&s;t; when the fine&s;t and mo&s;t elaborate di&s;cour&s;es, about the &s;ufficien|cy of CHRIST, and &s;uitablene&s;s of the way of &s;alvation, would not do it. When a man then comes to &s;ee the proper foundation of faith and affiance, with his own eyes, then he believes &s;avingly. <HI>He that &s;eeth the &s;on, and believeth on him, hath everlasting life.</HI> John vi 40. when CHRIST thus <HI>MANIFESTS GOD's NAME</HI> to men, then <HI>they believe that all things what&s;oever</HI> GOD <HI>has given to</HI> CHRIST <HI>are of him, and believe that</HI> CHRIST <HI>was &s;ent of</HI> GOD. John xvii. 6, 7, 8. And <HI>they that thus know</HI> CHRIST's <HI>name will trust in him.</HI> P&s;. ix 10. In order to true faith in JESUS CHRIST, the &s;on of GOD, is REVEAL|ED IN MEN. Gal. i. 15, 16. And 'tis this &s;ight of the divine beauty of CHRIST, that bows the wills, and draws the hearts of men. A &s;ight of the greatne&s;s of GOD in his attributes, may overwhelm men, and be more than they can endure; but the enmity and oppo&s;ition of the heart, may remain in its full &s;trength, and the will remain inflexible; whereas, one glimp&s;e of the moral and &s;piritual glory of GOD, and &s;upreme amiablene&s;s of JESUS CHRIST, &s;hining into the heart, overcomes and abo|li&s;hes this oppo&s;ition, and inclines the &s;oul to CHRIST, as it were, by an omnipotent power: So that now, not only the under&s;tanding, but the will, and the whole &s;oul receives and embraces the Saviour. This is mo&s;t certainly the di&s;|covery, which is the fir&s;t internal foundation of a &s;aving faith in CHRIST, in the &s;oul of the true convert; and not on having of it immediately &s;ugge&s;ted and revealed to the
<PB N="41" REF="023344_0040_0FBF0825BAFA82C0">
&s;oul, by a text of &s;cripture, or any immediate outward or inward witne&s;s, that CHRIST loves <HI>him,</HI> or that he died for <HI>him in particular,</HI> and is <HI>his</HI> &s;aviour; &s;o begetting con|fidence and joy, and a &s;eeming love to CHRIST, becau&s;e he loves him: By which &s;ort of faith and conver&s;ion, (de|mon&s;trably vain and counterfeit) multitudes have been deluded. The &s;ight of the glory of GOD, in the face of JESUS CHRIST, works true &s;upreme love to GOD: This is a &s;ight of the proper foundation of &s;upreme love to GOD, viz. The &s;upreme loveline&s;s of his nature; and a love to him on this ground, is truly above any thing that can come from a meer principle of &s;elf-love, which is in the hearts of Devils, as well as men. And this be|gets true &s;piritual and holy joy in the &s;oul, which is in|deed joy in GOD, and glorying in him, and not rejoicing in our&s;elves.</P>
<P>This &s;ight of the beauty of divine things, will excite true de&s;ires and longings of &s;oul, after tho&s;e things; not like the longings of Devils, or any &s;uch forced de&s;ires, as tho&s;e of a man in great danger of death, after &s;ome bitter medicine, that he hopes will &s;ave his life; but na|tural free de&s;ires, the de&s;ires of appetite; the thir&s;tings of a new nature; as a new-born babe de&s;ires the mother's brea&s;t; and as the hungry man longs for &s;ome plea&s;ant food he thinks of; or as the thir&s;ty hart pants after the cool and clear &s;tream.</P>
<P>This &s;en&s;e of divine beauty, is the fir&s;t thing in the actual change made in the &s;oul, in true conver&s;ion, and is the foundation of every thing el&s;e belonging to that change; as is evident by tho&s;e words of the Apo&s;tle, 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> iii. 18. <HI>But we all with open face, beholding as in a gla&s;s, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame image, from glory to glory, even as by the &s;pirit of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Truly gracious affections and exerci&s;es of mind dif|fer from &s;uch as are counterfeit, which ari&s;e from no higher principles than are in the hearts of Devils, in their tendency: And that in the&s;e two re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="42" REF="023344_0041_0FBF0843665EDC58">(1.) They are of a tendency and influence very con|trary to that, which was e&s;pecially the Devil's &s;in, even pride. That pride was in a peculiar manner the Devil's &s;in, is manife&s;t from 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 6. <HI>Not a Novice left, being lifted up with pride, he fell into the condemnation of the Devil.</HI> Fal&s;e and delu&s;ive experiences evermore tend to this; tho' oftentimes under the di&s;gui&s;e of great and extraordinary humility. Spiritual pride, is the prevailing temper, and general character of hypocrites, deluded with fal&s;e di&s;co|veries and affections. They are in general, of a di&s;po&s;i|tion directly contrary to tho&s;e two things belonging to the Chri&s;tian temper, directed to by the Apo&s;tle; the one in <HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 16 <HI>Be not wi&s;e in your own conceit</HI>; and the other in <HI>Philip.</HI> ii. 3. <HI>Let each e&s;teem others better than them|&s;elves.</HI> Fal&s;e experience is conceited of it&s;elf, and affected with it&s;elf. Thus he that has fal&s;e humility, is much af|fected to think, how he is aba&s;ed before GOD: He that has fal&s;e love, is affected, when he thinks of the great|ne&s;s of his love. The very food and nouri&s;hment of fal&s;e experience, is to view it&s;elf, and take much notice of it&s;elf; and it's very breath and life is to talk much of it|&s;elf, or &s;ome way to be &s;hewing it&s;elf. Whereas truly gracious views and affections, are of a quite contrary ten|dency: They nouri&s;h no &s;elf-conceit; no exalting con|ceit of the man's own righteou&s;ne&s;s, experience, or pri|vileges; no high conceit of his humiliations. They in|cline to no o&s;tentation, nor &s;elf-exaltation, under any di&s;gui&s;e what&s;oever. But that &s;en&s;e of the &s;upreme, holy beauty and glory of GOD and CHRIST, which is the foun|dation of them, and that only, mortifies pride, and truly humbles the &s;oul. It not only cuts off &s;ome of the out|ermo&s;t branches (cau&s;ing many branches to grow out, where but one was before) but it &s;trikes at the very root of pride; it alters the very nature and di&s;po&s;ition of the heart. The light of GOD's beauty, and that alone, truly &s;hews the &s;oul its own deformity, and effectually incline it to exalt GOD, and aba&s;e it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="43" REF="023344_0042_0FBF0844A3B53470">(2.) The&s;e gracious exerci&s;es and affections, differ from the other in their tendency, to de&s;troy Satan's intere&s;t. 1&s;t In the per&s;on him&s;elf, in their tendency, to cau&s;e the &s;oul to <HI>hate every evil, and fal&s;e way,</HI> and to produce uni|ver&s;al holine&s;s of heart and life; di&s;po&s;ing him to make the &s;ervice of GOD, and the promoting his glory, and the good of mankind, the very bu&s;ine&s;s of his life. Whereas tho&s;e fal&s;e di&s;coveries and affections, have not this effect. There may indeed, be great zeal, and a great deal of what is called religion; but it is not a truly Chri&s;tian zeal; 'tis not a being zealous of good works: Their Religion is not the &s;ervice of GOD; 'tis not a &s;eeking and &s;erving GOD; but indeed, a &s;eeking and &s;erving them&s;elves. Tho' there may be a change of life, 'tis not a change from every wicked way, to a uniform Chri&s;tian life and practice; but only a turning the &s;tream of corruption from one channel to another. Thus the Apo&s;tle James di&s;tingui&s;hes, in our context, a true faith, from the faith of Devils: James ii. 19, 20. <HI>Thou believe&s;t there is one</HI> GOD. <HI>The Devils al&s;o believe and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that &s;aith without works is dead?</HI> And thus the Apo&s;tle John di&s;tingui&s;hes true communion with GOD. 1. John i. 6, 7. <HI>If we &s;ay that we have fellow&s;hip with him, and walk in darkne&s;s, we lie, and do not the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellow&s;hip one with another, and the blood of</HI> CHRIST <HI>clean&s;eth us from all &s;in.</HI> By this he di&s;tingui&s;hes true &s;piritual knowledge, Chap ii. 3, 4. <HI>Herely we do know, that we know him, if we keep his commandments. He that &s;aith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</HI> And hereby the &s;ame Apo&s;tle di&s;tingui&s;hes true love. Chap. iii. 18, 19. <HI>Let us not love in word and in tongue, but in deed,</HI> [<HI>in work,</HI> as the word &s;ignifies] and in truth. <HI>And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and &s;hall a&s;&s;ure our hearts before him.</HI></P>

operations of the &s;pirit of GOD, and in high <HI>pretences</HI> and great <HI>appearances</HI> of inward experimental Religion; when this prevails among a people, tho' for the pre&s;ent it may &s;urprize many, and may be the occa&s;ion of alarming and awakening &s;ome &s;inners; yet in the final i&s;&s;ue of things, tends greatly to wound and weaken the cau&s;e of vital Religion, and to &s;trengthen the intere&s;t of Satan, de&s;pe|rately to harden the hearts of &s;inners, exceedingly to fill the world with prejudice, again&s;t the power of Godline&s;s, to promote infidelity, and licentious principles and prac|tices, to build up, and make &s;trong the Devil<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> king|dom in the world, more than open vice and profanene&s;s, or profe&s;&s;ed Athei&s;m, or publick per&s;ecution; and per|haps, more than any thing el&s;e what&s;oever.</P>
<P>But it is not &s;o with true Religion, in it's genuine beau|ty. That, if it prevails in great power, will doubtle&s;s excite the rage of the Devil, and many other enemies of Religion: However, it gives great advantage to its friends, and exceedingly &s;trengthens the cau&s;e; and tends to convince or confound enemies. True Religion, is a divine light in the &s;ouls of the &s;aints; and as it &s;hines out in the conver&s;ation before men, it tends to induce others to glorify GOD. There is nothing like it, (as to means) to awaken the con&s;ciences of men, to convince infidels, and to &s;top the mouths of gain&s;ayers. Tho' men natu|rally hate the power of Godline&s;s; yet, when they &s;ee the fruits of it, there is a witne&s;s in their con&s;ciences in its favour. <HI>He that &s;erveth</HI> CHRIST <HI>in righteou&s;ne&s;, and peace, and joy&punc; in the Holy Ghost, is acceptable to</HI> GOD, <HI>and approv|ed of man.</HI> Rom. xiv. 17, 18. The prevailing of true Religion, ever tends to the honour of Religion in the world; tho' it commonly is the occa&s;ion of great per&s;e|cution. 'Tis a &s;ure thing, the more it appears, and is exemplified in the view of the world, the more will its honour, and the honour of its author be advanced.&mdash; Philip. i. 11. <HI>Being filled with the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s; which are by</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>unto the glory and prai&s;e of</HI> GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="023344_0044_0FBF085186227328">The <HI>third</HI> USE may be of <HI>exhortation,</HI> to &s;eek tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing qualifications and affections of &s;oul, which neither the Devil, nor any unholy being, <HI>has,</HI> or <HI>can have.</HI></P>
<P>How excellent is that inward virtue and Religion, which con&s;i&s;t in tho&s;e! Herein con&s;i&s;ts the mo&s;t excellent experiences of &s;aints and angels in Heaven. Herein con|&s;i&s;ts the be&s;t experience of the man, CHRIST JESUS; whether in his humbled, or glorified &s;tate. Herein con&s;i&s;ts the image of GOD: Yea, this is &s;poken of in &s;cripture, as a communication of &s;omething of G<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">D's own beauty and excellency, <HI>a participation of the divine nature</HI>; 2. Pet. i. 4. <HI>a partaking of his holine&s;s</HI>; Heb. xii 10. <HI>A partak|ing of</HI> CHRIST's <HI>fullne&s;s</HI>; John i. 16. Hereby the &s;aints are <HI>fill'd with all the fullne&s;s of GOD</HI>; Eph. iii. 18, 19. Here|by they <HI>have fellow&s;hip with, both the father and the &s;on,</HI> (1. John i. 13.) that is, they communicate with them in their happine&s;s. Yea, by means of this divine virtue, there is a mutual indwelling of GOD and the &s;aints; 1. John iv. 10. GOD <HI>is love; and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in</HI> GOD, <HI>and</HI> GOD <HI>in him.</HI></P>
<P>This Qualification mu&s;t render the per&s;on that has it, excellent and happy indeed; and doubtle&s;s, is the high|e&s;t dignity, and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of any creature. This is the peculiar gift of GOD, which he be&s;tows only on his &s;pe|cial favourites.&mdash;As to Silver, Gold, and Diamonds, earthly Crowns and Kingdoms, He often throws 'em out to tho&s;e that he e&s;teems as Dogs and Swine; but this is the peculiar ble&s;&s;ing of his dear Children: This is what Fle&s;h and Blood can't impart, and what all the Devils in Hell, can't work the lea&s;t degree of in any heart; 'tis GOD alone can be&s;tow it. This was the &s;pecial benefit, which CHRIST died to procure for his Elect, the mo&s;t ex|cellent token of his everla&s;ting Love; the chief fruit of his great Labours, and the mo&s;t precious Purcha&s;e of his Blood.</P>
<P>By this, above all other Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">, do men glorify GOD.

By this, above all other things, do the Saints &s;hine as Lights in the World, and are ble&s;&s;ings to Mankind. And this, above all things, tends to their own Comfort; from hence ari&s;es that <HI>Peace which pa&s;&s;eth all Under&s;tanding,</HI> and that <HI>Joy, which is un&s;peakable and full of Glory:</HI> and this is that which will mo&s;t certainly i&s;&s;ue in the eternal Sal|vation of tho&s;e that have it: 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible, that the Soul, wherein it is, &s;hould &s;ink and peri&s;h: 'Tis an im|mortal Seed; 'tis eternal Life begun; and therefore, they that have it, <HI>can never die.</HI> 'Tis the dawning of the light of Glory.

This is that <HI>Water</HI> CHRIST <HI>gives, which is in him that drinks it, a Well of Water &s;pringing up into everlasting life:</HI> John iv. 14. 'Tis &s;omething from Heaven, is of a Heavenly nature, and tends to Heaven. And tho&s;e that have it, however they may now wander in a Wilderne&s;s, or be to&s;&s;ed to and fro, on a tempe&s;tuous Ocean, &s;hall certainly arrive in Heaven at la&s;t, where this heavenly &s;park &s;hall be increa&s;ed, and perfected, and the Souls of the Saints, all be transformed into a bright and Pure Flame, and they &s;hall &s;hine forth as the Sun, in the Kingdom of their Father.
