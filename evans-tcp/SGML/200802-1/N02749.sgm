<P>_A Sincere and di&s;intere&s;ted regard for the good of my Neighbours, is the motive of this pre&s;ent Publication: without Pa&s;&s;ion or Prejudice, laying a&s;ide all u&s;ele&s;s Speculations and Sub|tilities, as out of the Que&s;tion in ca&s;es of Fact and Experience; I &s;hall impartially relate, The
<PB REF="003274_0003_0FF02FF947AB1E98">
Hi&s;tory, Succe&s;s and, Benefits of the Method of receiving the Small Pox by Inci&s;ions or Inoculation, as it is called, &s;o far as it has come to my know|ledge. Altercations in matters of Fact obvious to the Sen&s;es, are trifling and ab&s;urd; let Facts be truly related and &s;et in a proper Method or Light, the generality of Mankind are capable to judge for them&s;elves. I &s;hall not be too free with Names of Per&s;ons, only where the vouching of Facts may &s;eem to require it. There have been too early and &s;trong Prejudices, both for and again&s;t this Me|thod; People have been partially Credulous or Incre|dulous of Facts, as they make for or again&s;t their re&s;pective Opinions, <HI>viz,</HI> In &s;ome it &s;avoured much of Credulity, Levity, and Novelty, to be bigotly Zealous for it; in others it &s;how'd too much of &s;trong Pre|judices, Pa&s;&s;ions or Ob&s;tinate Humour, to be furi|ou&s;ly again&s;t it: they &s;eem to have acted the faire&s;t part, who exclaiming only again&s;t ra&s;h and irregu|lar procedure, were willing to wait patiently until time and a cautious experience &s;hould direct their judgments.</P>
<P>MANY great di&s;coveries in Phy&s;ick have been opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed by the generality of the Faculty at their fir&s;t appearance, Antimonial Vomits, Mercurial Preparations, the Peruvian Bark, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had this fate; but are now by experience proved to be the be&s;t of Medicines. It was not by rea&s;oning we learnt that the Bark cures Agues, that Opium relieves Pain, or Mercury carries off the Venereal taint; it was by accident, but afterwards confirmed by Ex|perience.

How mean or ra&s;h &s;oever the beginning of the Practice of Inoculating the Small Pox may have been; if many Years practi&s;ed by Old Wo|men only, and neglected by the Sons of Art in Turky; if in another part of the World a Per&s;on of no Literature and of habitual Ra&s;hne&s;s, from a third hand hear&s;ay of an ever Credulous per&s;on, fir&s;t attempted it indifferently on all who would pay for it, without regard to Age, Sex, Con&s;titution, other Circum&s;tances, and Caution's which tryals of &s;uch Con&s;equence may require; as it is one of the inconveniences of Humane Life, that all the World over, Ignorance, A&s;&s;urance and Ra&s;hne&s;s pu&s;hes on &s;ome to attempt without fear or di&s;cretion what would make the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Arti&s;t tremble to touch; neverthele&s;s if in the Event by repeated ex|periments it prove u&s;eful, it ought to be embraced.</P>
<P>WE find by &s;ome Years Experience, that the Small Pox ab&s;tractedly con&s;idered, received by In|oculation is not &s;o Fatal and the Symptoms frequently more mild, than in the accidental Contagion; yet it is not of that certain &s;afety, to exempt it from be|ing reckoned precarious, and therefore requires Di&s;|cretion in applying it to proper Subjects, and Judg|ment in managing the Di&s;temper &s;o receiv'd.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on of my Addre&s;&s;ing this to You, Sir, Is as a &s;ort of Publick Acknowledgement of your Friend&s;hip; but more e&s;pecially becau&s;e of your noted Probity, Integrity, and Impartiality in all Affairs: in your Office with an unbia&s;&s;ed Duty to the Crown,

Surgeon 62, Mr. <HI>Maitland</HI> 85, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN this <HI>Practice</HI> was fir&s;t attempted, &s;ome Phy&s;icians in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>New-England</HI> parti|cularly Dr. <HI>Friend,</HI> from the experience of di&s;|orders ari&s;ing in the <HI>Animal Oeconomy</HI> by &s;ome foreign liquids being directly admitted into the current of <HI>Blood,</HI> by anology were afraid of the like in ca&s;e of <HI>Inoculation</HI>; but repeated tryals &s;oon convinced them of the &s;afety of this method. In &s;ome of the fir&s;t tryals the produced <HI>Pu&s;tules</HI> were either dry without <HI>Pus,</HI> or like a <HI>Spurious Pox</HI> called the <HI>Chicken</HI> or <HI>Swine</HI> Pox, containing no thick dige&s;ted <HI>Pus</HI> but a thin <HI>Sanies</HI>; hence they alledged that <HI>Inoculation</HI> produced only an <HI>Eruptive Fever</HI> but no <HI>genuine</HI> Small-Pox: but in
<PB N="5" REF="003274_0010_0FF0301576D7FE48">
after tryals, &s;eeing in many the <HI>Pu&s;tules</HI> ri&s;e with inflamed edges, white &amp; afterwards yellow heads, plump and mellow, and go off about the u&s;ual time in yellow Scabs, as al&s;o finding them <HI>infectious</HI>; they quickly gave up the point, and <HI>declared</HI> them <HI>genuine.</HI> The <HI>Odium</HI> of &s;pread|ing infection continues a di&s;advantage; The ingrafting of foreign <HI>con&s;titutional ails</HI> is a &s;tum|bling block to the nice and cautious.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t <HI>Promoters of Inoculation,</HI> on the o|ther hand, were much more extravagant in their <HI>deviations</HI>; from <HI>hear&s;ay</HI> and a few <HI>&s;canty</HI> experiments with much <HI>credulity</HI> and <HI>ra&s;hne&s;s,</HI> they po&s;itively and without re&s;erve, publi&s;hed as follows; and in &s;ome in&s;tances contradict one the other and them&s;elves.</P>

<P>Dr. <HI>Le Duc</HI> a Native of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and who was him&s;elf inoculated, a&s;&s;ured Dr. <HI>Jurin,</HI> that out of many thou&s;ands that in the &s;pace of a|bout 40 years pa&s;t, had been inoculated in and about <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> by one Greek woman, not &s;o much as one per&s;on has mi&s;carried.</P>

I &s;hall mention a few In&s;tances of this <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> from his own <HI>Letters</HI> concerning Inoculation publi&s;hed in <HI>London</HI>: in one Letter Dated <HI>March</HI> 1722 He tells the world, That <HI>A.</HI> 1721. in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Cats</HI> had a regular Small-Pox and died of it; that during the Small Pox, the Pigeons and Dunghill Fowls did not lay nor hatch, <HI>that he never knew Bli&s;tering mi&s;s of &s;aving life in the Small-Pox, &amp;c.</HI> In his Letter communicated to the R.

To allow of &s;uch gro&s;s &amp; bold a&s;&s;ertions without di&s;proving of them, would be leading Mankind into a <HI>Snare.</HI></P>
<P>ALTHO' <HI>Levity</HI> &amp; <HI>Credulity</HI> brought people in|to it at fir&s;t, without waiting the effects of a rea&s;on|able number of <HI>Experiments,</HI> mo&s;t of the <HI>Anti-Inoculators</HI>

As in &s;ome con&s;titutions of years the infecti|on is not &s;o apt to &s;pread as in others, <HI>to force the &s;preading of it</HI> by this Artificial method no man (excepting one who has le&s;s regard for the lives and good of mankind, than the ready Mo|ney) will ju&s;tifie. I am told that about 45 years ago the Small Pox got into &s;everal Fami|lies in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and &s;oon went off without di&s;|&s;eminating it &s;elf. The <HI>Plague</HI> which is recko|ned more infectious than the Small Pox was in <HI>London,</HI> from 1602, to 1632, every year there died a few of it, but it did not &s;pread excepting in 1603 there dyed of it 30. 561, and in 1625 dyed 35. 417. The <HI>Small Pox</HI> in <HI>London</HI> &s;ome years is far more univer&s;al and malignant than in other years, for in&s;tance, from the <HI>Bills of Mortality, A.</HI> 1702 dyed of the Small Pox only 311, in the year 1706 dyed 1721, in the year 1719 dies 3229. La&s;t Small Pox left <HI>N. England</HI> very abruptly, while the Promoters of Inoculation were endeavouring to force it into the Country Towns; but the <HI>Roxbury</HI> deaths bafled their recommendations. To force the &s;preading of infection by an <HI>unbounded Inocula|tion</HI> is a hard&s;hip upon Mankind, to oblige them to quit their bu&s;ine&s;s with their habitations; means u&s;ed to &s;ave my own life, ought not to endanger my Neighbours. Perhaps it is <HI>more infecting</HI> than in the common way, becau&s;e af|ter

<P>As fear, anxiety and de&s;pondency or dejec|tion of Spirits are of bad con&s;equence in all Di&s;ea&s;es, and more e&s;pecially in the Small Pox illne&s;s; I cannot avoid taking notice of the In|advertency or <HI>Inhumanity</HI> of &s;ome Inoculation Promoters particularly in this Town, who with <HI>fal&s;e colourings</HI> expo&s;e the Mortality of the Small Pox in the natural way. They harangue thus, <HI>The Small Pox always fatal to</HI> New-England. Mr. <HI>Boyl&s;tone</HI> in his fir&s;t account &s;ays, The Small Pox was an <HI>awful</HI> Di&s;temper, whereof &s;o many died as gave an awful Pro&s;pect. In his <HI>a&s;&s;uming Dedication</HI> to the <HI>Princes of Wales,</HI> he &s;ays the rea&s;on of his undertaking Inoculation was, becau&s;e the Small Pox raged in <HI>New-England</HI> with the utmo&s;t Violence: let us recollect and we may find that 22d <HI>July</HI> 1721 the <HI>Select-Men</HI> declare that only 17 by that time had died of it, the Small Pox had then been in Town about three Months, and this was near a Month after Inoculation began, at that time &s;o far as we could inve&s;tigate about 1 in 10 died of it; how few Popular Fevers have been &s;o favourable, witne&s;s that <HI>Febris mali moris</HI> Epidemical here in the Fall. Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> in his Letters publi&s;h|ed in <HI>London,</HI> gives the rea&s;on why they u&s;ed no precaution: becau&s;e in the natural way it raged with the <HI>utmo&s;t fury,</HI> and to make his a&s;&s;ertion good, &s;ays that of &s;omething more than 5000,

(I do not include <HI>A.</HI> 1722. becau&s;e the <HI>premature deaths</HI> of 1721. had much le&s;&s;ened the burials for that year) there dyed 411: the mean is 385. from which deduct the above 258, remains 127 deaths of <HI>Valetudina|rians</HI> who (if we may &s;o expre&s;s it) mu&s;t have dyed that year of other ails: or if we compute thus <HI>A.</HI> 1722. dyed only 273, therefore the former year had <HI>anticipated</HI> this 118 of its due Burials; the <HI>medium</HI> of both computations is 122, which deducted from 5989 and from 844 leaves 722 deaths in 5867 is &s;omething more than 1 in 8. To reduce the Small Pox <HI>morta|lity</HI> further let us con&s;ider, 1. The di&s;advantage of its <HI>prevailing in the Autumn</HI> or Fall, the mo&s;t Sickly time of the year. 2.

afflicted the Town only &s;ix times; <HI>A.</HI> 1649, 1666, 1678, 1690, 1702, &amp; 1721. I cannot &s;ee any rea&s;on to magnifie the chance, and ri&s;que which a <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> man has of dying by the Small Pox.

<P><HI>THE advantages of Inoculation.</HI> 1 The Small Pox received by <HI>Inci&s;ions</HI> from the experience of Some years, <HI>ab&s;tractedly</HI> con&s;idered, is found not &s;o Mortal and the Symtoms generally more fa|vourable than when it is received by accidental contagition. 2 One may take the advantage of <HI>benign</HI> Small-Pox con&s;titution, and <HI>a favourable Sea&s;on</HI> of the year to receive it. 3 The Body may be <HI>prepared</HI> and &s;o &s;ecure our &s;elves from being taken at a di&s;advantage and &s;urpri&s;e, it is an advantage to know that we are to have a di&s;tem|per 7 or 8 days before it &s;eizes us. 4. It removes that dread and anxiety which is a great unea&s;i|ne&s;s to &s;ome who have not had the Small-Pox.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Royal Family</HI> by their Example, have ob|viated the Su&s;picion, which made the Practitioners
<PB N="26" REF="003274_0031_0FF0304C61E4F0E0">
here decline it formerly, I mean of its being Cri|minal. I find <HI>the Practitioners in Town do generally re&s;olve to perform the Opperation when required,</HI> but without per&s;wading or di&s;wading; &s;o that tho&s;e who are &s;o inclined will have a better chance and choice without being oblidged to expo&s;e them&s;elves to a <HI>Ra&s;h Operator</HI>; however &s;afe this method may be, di&s;cretion and care are ne|ce&s;&s;ary, out of Mr. <HI>Boyl&s;tons</HI> 72 or 73 <HI>Roxbury Inoculated Patients</HI> (Mr. <HI>White</HI> included) <HI>dyed</HI> 5: <HI>out of Mr. Thomp&s;ons</HI> 28 <HI>Inoculations in the &s;ame Towns and &s;ea&s;on there dyed not one.</HI></P>
<P>THE Operation of Inoculation is always &s;afe even in the rude&s;t hand; Blood letting is attended with the ri&s;que of pricking an Artery, tendon or membrane of the mu&s;cle; in this the Skin being elevated nothing lays in the way. The Symptoms in the Inoculated Small-Pox are the &s;ame as in the natural, and require the &s;ame management.</P>
<P>ALTHO' by Inoculation there is a <HI>better chance</HI> than by accidental contagion, neverthele&s;s it is not exempted from being <HI>precarious,</HI> as we have at length exemplified; but as there is no <HI>ab&s;o|lute certainty</HI> in humane affairs, mankind go|vern them&s;elves by the greate&s;t <HI>probabilities.</HI> If it is found a better chance for pre&s;erving Life in this Illne&s;s, it will not be ea&s;y for <HI>En|thu&s;ia&s;ts</HI> and &s;uch like <HI>divines</HI> to make the world believe it a Sin; thus &s;ome <HI>Turks</HI> and many of our Neighbours, altho' rigorous <HI>prede&s;tinari|ans,</HI> at the cry of Small Pox <HI>malignity,</HI> do fly to it as a refuge. Suppo&s;e an Epidemical and

mortal <HI>Diarrhaea</HI> or <HI>Dy&s;entery</HI> rage in a place, if I can carry off its proper <HI>Pabulum</HI> by <HI>Catharticks,</HI> which is an Analagous artificial Di&s;temper of the &s;ame Species, may it not be done? an im|pending periodical <HI>Haemorrhage</HI> may it not be diverted by an Artificial V. S. The <HI>adequate Analogy</HI> of this, puts me in mind of the <HI>fallacy</HI> of an argument commonly u&s;ed by the Inocu|lators, <HI>Artificial</HI> V. S. <HI>Catharticks, drawing of Teeth, cutting of Corns, &amp;c. have been the occa&s;ions of deaths, mu&s;t they be di&s;u&s;ed</HI>? In the&s;e &s;ome accident in the Operation is to blame, not na|ture prematurely &s;et at work to acquire an acute di&s;temper by a &s;afe Operation; A preventive Vo|mit, Purge, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> affects only my &s;elf not my Neigh|bour.</P>
<P>Seeing at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t zealous Inoculator does not pretend that there is any <HI>ab&s;olute cer|tainty</HI> in this affair, a <HI>Country retreat</HI> in my Judgement, may be advi&s;able to the following <HI>conditions</HI> of per&s;ons. 1. To tho&s;e who are <HI>much advanced in years,</HI> who in the common cour&s;e of nature may <HI>not &s;urvive</HI> the next return of this contagion; the <HI>infirmities</HI> of old age is a di&s;advantage likewi&s;e to be con&s;idered. 2. <HI>Preg|nant women</HI>; and in general all of the <HI>Fair Sex</HI> who&s;e bui&s;ine&s;s can allow of a Country retire|ment for &s;ome months once in 12 or 20 years, and who&s;e <HI>faces</HI> are &s;ome part of their care and concern, &s;ome faces having &s;uffered la&s;t Inocu|lation time. 3. The con&s;umptive and <HI>bad ha|bits,</HI> who&s;e <HI>crazy fabricks</HI> cannot without a con|&s;iderable ri&s;que, &s;tand the &s;hock of an acute di&s;temper. 4. <HI>Infants,</HI> who&s;e green and tender

age with the incidents of <HI>crudities, Tormina</HI>'s, <HI>Teething, &amp;c.</HI> is of it &s;elf precarious, without the accumulation of a Small Pox illne&s;s. 5. <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> few of them are ob&s;erved to &s;urvive the Small-Pox in the natural way, &amp; therefore are not without con&s;iderable hazard in the other way. 6. <HI>Some particular Families of Whites,</HI> who have &s;omething peculiar in their con&s;titution that can|not bear this infection (fire is not always as the flame from whence it is derived, but as the fewel to which it is applied) we have had in|&s;tances of this, Mr. <HI>White</HI> and his Si&s;ter both di|ed by Inoculation, the Family of <HI>W&mdash;bs</HI> &s;uffered much, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By &s;ome &s;ingularity of temperament, &s;ome are proof again&s;t the Pocky contagion, to others it is always mortal. 7. <HI>The exceedingly Timorous</HI> need not to be mentioned, it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed that fear will give them Wings.</P>
<P>THESE who are in <HI>good Health,</HI> and not in any of the&s;e circum&s;tances, are <HI>fit &s;ubjects for Inocu|lation,</HI> more e&s;pecially who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s requires them to be in foreign parts where the Small Pox always more or le&s;s prevails. Since the practice is not Criminal, they who from a publick Spi|rit undergo the experiment, may be reckoned to e&s;&s;ay the <HI>benefit of Mankind</HI> for generations to come.</P>
<P><HI>The be&s;t preparation for the Small Pox to</HI> be received either by accident or by inci&s;ions is to keep the mind as chearful, &amp; the body as health|ful as we can. <HI>The &s;ymptoms of health</HI> are a good Stomach, ea&s;ie dige&s;tion, regular pul&s;e, quiet and undi&s;turbed Sleep.</P>
