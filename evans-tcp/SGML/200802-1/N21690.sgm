<HEAD>A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE EPIDEMICAL FEVER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I fir&s;t determined on publi&s;hing the pre|&s;ent pamphlet, it was my intention to have pre&s;ented the Public with a Work not inferior to the one pub|li&s;hed by that indefatigable man, and meritorious Au|thor, Mr. Mathew Carey, of Philadelphia&punc; and to accompli&s;h this de&s;irable object, I applied to &s;everal medical friends to write a Di&s;&s;ertation upon the di&s;|ea&s;e, with a &s;tatement of &s;uch important facts as came within their knowledge, and promi&s;ed to furni&s;h them with all that I could obtain. In this plea&s;ing anticipa|tion, however, I have been much di&s;appointed, for each and all declined undertaking the bu&s;ine&s;s, for lo|cal rea&s;ons. I mention this circum&s;tance as an apolo|gy for my coming forward, I tru&s;t, before an indulgent Public. The great &s;atisfaction which many &s;trangers may derive from peru&s;ing an accurate li&s;t of the deaths, and thereby di&s;covering, in a degree, whether or not, their friends and connexions are &s;till living, in|duced me to procure the &s;tatement which is annexed to the Work.</P>
<P>It is not my intention to hazard any opinion what|ever, upon the di&s;ea&s;e, whether imported or originat|ing in local cau&s;es; but &s;imply to collect the &s;everal letters and other publications which have appeared on the &s;ubject, and which I conceive will be found any way intere&s;ting or &s;atisfactory to the reader. The proceedings of the Health Committee, the different
<PB N="6" REF="028538_0004_0FD937FDF0338210">
letters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are arranged agreeable to the dates on which they appeared.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be con&s;idered a duty incumbent on me to &s;ay &s;omething concerning the &s;ituation of the city, previous to the introduction or appearance of the di&s;ea&s;e: and in the&s;e remarks, as well as in any others I may have occa&s;ion to offer, I &s;hall be as laconic as the nature of the &s;ubject will permit.</P>
<P>New York was, doubtle&s;s, one of the mo&s;t increa&s;|ing and flouri&s;hing cities in the United States. Some idea may be formed of its rapid population, by remark|ing, that in the year 1791 it contained about 4,700 families, and in May 1795 about 9,000. This &s;tate|ment is from the City Directory, which is annually tak|en. Since the commencement of the pre&s;ent war be|tween France and the combined de&s;pots, the nece&s;&s;aries of life had progre&s;&s;ively ri&s;en, till they had arrived at an enormous price, and in many particulars beyond what was ever remembered here before. Such is the effect the war had, and &s;till continues to have on Ame|rica, at lea&s;t this part of it, notwith&s;tanding our <HI>boa&s;ted neutrality:</HI> What is &s;till more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, the ri&s;e of mecha|nical labour had by no means been equal, or bore a ju&s;t proportion to the former. The one had ri&s;en, in many in|&s;tances, an hundred per cent. while the other, generally &s;peaking, had not ri&s;e more than from twenty-five to thir|ty. The rent of hou&s;es had al&s;o nearly doubled, particu|larly tho&s;e which were &s;ituated in the mo&s;t public &s;treets.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances rendered it difficult for people in moderate &s;tations, to do more than maintain and edu|cate their families. The city, however, was fa&s;t in|crea&s;ing in luxury and pride, tho&s;e barriers to happi|ne&s;s; and many who con&s;idered <HI>virtue</HI> and not <HI>num|bers,</HI> the &s;trength of a republic, dreaded the future con&s;equences. Splendor, pomp, and di&s;&s;ipation, were at a &s;hameful height. Money was in great demand: The intere&s;t frequently given was from two to three per cent a month.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="028538_0005_0FD937FFD30B4E20">
In con&s;equence of the enormous price of rents, ma|ny families, particularly among the Iri&s;h emigrants, were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of living, or rather exi&s;t|ing, in damp cellars, and among this cla&s;s of people it will be found that the di&s;order was mo&s;t prevalent, and operated mo&s;t powerfully. I believe it may be &s;afely a&s;&s;erted, that a very large proportion of tho&s;e, in tole|rable &s;ituations, who had proper medical aid in the ear|ly &s;tages of the di&s;order, and were regularly attended afterwards, perfectly recovered in the cour&s;e of ten or fifteen days.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to a few remarks on the general &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>"THIS malady, in many in&s;tances, has been pre|ceded by an unu&s;ual flow of &s;pirits, though for the mo&s;t part a degree of &s;tupor has been ob&s;erved; &s;ome hours after they are attacked with violent pains in the head, back and loins: The bowels are extremely co&s;|tive, &s;eldom yielding but to powerful purgatives, and the tongue &s;oon becomes con&s;iderably foul. In &s;ome ca&s;es, the pul&s;e is &s;trong and ten&s;e; the countenance flu&s;hed; the eyes greatly inflamed; the pains more violent, and re&s;piration very laborious. In others, and more particularly tho&s;e of a &s;lender habit of body, the pul&s;e is weak, though frequent; the face rather pale and of a yellowi&s;h tinge; a con&s;tant de&s;ire for &s;leep; &s;orene&s;s over the whole &s;y&s;tem, and extreme debility. About the third and fourth days the &s;ymptoms become more violent; the tongue is dry and covered with a black &s;curf; the appetite greatly impaired; re&s;piration more difficult; the pul&s;e &s;carcely to be di&s;cerned; &s;ud|den &s;tartings, when in a do&s;e, as though affrighted; a &s;en&s;e of weight around the praecordia; the body more yellow, but particularly the face and brea&s;t; the ex|tremities cold; the &s;tomach unable to retain its con|tents, and what is thrown up in vomiting, has the ap|pearance of black coffee grounds; a hemorrhage of the fauces, and frequently a di&s;charge of blood with the
<PB N="8" REF="028538_0006_0FD9380535C13B00">
&s;tools, which were now perfectly black; convul&s;ive motions of the &s;uperior extremities, and &s;hortly death terminated the &s;cene. The body now put on every appearance of immediate putrefaction.</P>
<P>In one per&s;on whom I had an opportunity of vi&s;iting, attacked in this alarming manner, the lower extremities were almo&s;t black; the evacuations involuntary; the parts to which bli&s;ters were applied, were &s;eemingly mortified; the blood oozed out of every part where it could find vent, and in fact he was a perfect ma&s;s of putrefaction, before the vital functions were &s;u&s;|pended<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MS. Of George Davis.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>It may not be improper to remark, that a very great dif|erence of opinion prevailed among the phy&s;icians, both as to the di&s;ea&s;e and the treatment of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Another circum|&s;tance which engaged much of the public attention was the appearance of an adverti&s;ement in the new&s;papers, again&s;t the mode of treating the di&s;ea&s;e by the practiti|oners in general, and challenging them to defend their practice. The author was Mr. Alexander Cuthill, taylor. Which of the parties were right is not my province to determine; but to &s;tate facts is my object. In &s;ome in&s;tances the doctors po&s;itively refu&s;ed vi&s;iting a patient who had been &s;een during his indi&s;po&s;ition by Mr. Cuthill; and in others di&s;continued their vi&s;its on finding that he al&s;o came to the hou&s;e where the &s;ick per&s;on lay. I leave the public to draw what inference they plea&s;e from the&s;e facts.</P>
<P>A general opinion has prevailed, among medical cha|racters in particular, that the pre&s;ent epidemic has made its appearance in a greater or le&s;s degree, among us du|ring the autumns of the la&s;t three or four years. That a malignant fever did rage here, during the months of September and Oct. of 1791, is a fact, and on compa|ring the &s;ymptoms with tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent di&s;ea&s;e, they will be found not di&s;&s;imilar. It is worthy of no|tice that the fever in 1791 fir&s;t made its appearance
<PB N="9" REF="028538_0007_0FD93807FB3760C8">
within a few yards of the &s;pot where it has proved mo&s;t fatal the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>"About the middle of Augu&s;t, 1791, a contagious fever appeared in the city of New York, which fir&s;t di&s;covered it&s;elf near Peck &s;lip, a part of the city thick|ly inhabited; its hou&s;es generally &s;mall, and badly ventulated: many of the inhabitants were in indigent circum&s;tances, which is a frequent cau&s;e of the want of cleanline&s;s. Here it raged a con&s;iderable time; it then began to &s;pread, as &s;ome attendants on the &s;ick be|came affected, who lived in other neighbourhoods.&mdash;</P>
<P>By this means it was carried to different families, and mo&s;t generally could be traced from this &s;ource. It likewi&s;e proved more particularly fatal near the place where it fir&s;t appeared, than in any other part. Thus, at length it &s;pread through the city, until about the middle of October, when the weather growing a little cooler, the di&s;ea&s;e greatly abated, and in a &s;hort time nearly di&s;appeared. I have been informed by &s;everal phy&s;icians of reputation, who re&s;ide and practice in the country, that many of the boatmen who frequented the city from Long I&s;land, and the upper part of Hud|&s;on's river, carried the di&s;ea&s;e home, where it proved fatal to &s;everal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor William Moore, an eminent phy&s;ician of New-York, informed me that a gentleman of Lime, in the &s;tate of Connecticut, was on a vi&s;it to this city when he became a patient of his, in whom the di&s;ea&s;e was evidently marked, attended with large vibices; he, however recruited con&s;iderably before he left the city: on his pa&s;|&s;age to Lime he relap&s;ed, and died &s;hortly after he reached home. The greater part of his family caught the contagion, and &s;oon be|came affected with a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e; which proved fatal to his mo|ther, and &s;ome other per&s;ons in the family.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time in the &s;outh we&s;tern part of the city, an intermittent and remittent fever prevailed, to|gether with a few ca&s;es of dy&s;entery. This cau&s;ed much di&s;pute among phy&s;icians as they generally na|med the di&s;ea&s;e from the ca&s;es which they had an op|portunity
<PB N="10" REF="028538_0008_0FD93809A3BBFAD0">
of &s;eeing mo&s;t prevalent. Some called it a remittent, others billious; &s;ome typhus, putrid, or ma|lignant; and others, following Sydenham, <HI>febris, bili|o&s;a remittens.</HI></P>
<P>In con&s;equence of a few ca&s;es terminating &s;uddenly fatal, together with the very unju&s;t, as well as unge|nerous judgment of &s;ome phy&s;icians, in determining every di&s;ea&s;e to be the putrid fever, fear &s;pread from mind to mind like a devouring famine, and terror, fre|quently more hideous than the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf, wrought on the minds of the credulous and weak. This, in &s;ome ca&s;es, greatly increa&s;ed the malignity of the fever: in others again, even a &s;light head ache cau&s;ed them to de&s;pond, and threw them into a &s;tate of languor more ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed; but without the real &s;ymptoms of the fever. Whether this diagno&s;tic was given through ignorance, or as a profe&s;&s;ional trick, in order to gain applau&s;e, by making many and &s;peedy cures, is uncertain; however, it was neverthele&s;s &s;o con&s;idered. Thus &s;ome phy&s;icians obtained a credit in curing the complaint, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any real merit.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e, generally, in the fir&s;t place, affected the per&s;on with a &s;en&s;e of chilline&s;s, alternating with gen|tle flu&s;hings and a &s;en&s;e of &s;orene&s;s of all the mu&s;cles; the face appeared pale, the features &s;hrunk, the body weary, as if it had undergone &s;ome great fatigue, at|tended with yawnings and &s;tretchings of the extremities; a di&s;inclination for any bodily exerci&s;e; and when any exertion was made, it was attended with &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s and unweary &s;en&s;ations. The pul&s;e at this time was weak and frequent; the mental faculties were likewi&s;e impaired, and frequently a &s;mall pain in the head, at|tended with &s;ighings and anorexy: re&s;piration being anxious and rather &s;mall at this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es the following &s;ymptoms took place without the patient's knowledge of the former having pa&s;t: they however, in general, preceded, violent pains in the head, back, loins; a pul&s;e more ten&s;e, full, and
<PB N="11" REF="028538_0009_0FD9380B01644708">
&s;omething increa&s;ed in fullne&s;s. (In one ca&s;e the pati|ent compared the pul&s;ation of the temporal arteries, to the &s;triking of a hammer again&s;t his temples. In &s;ome a delirium came on immediately after the cold &s;tage, &s;o that the per&s;ons affected got out of their beds, and wandered about their rooms or hou&s;es. Sometimes nau&s;ea and vomiting appeared early in the di&s;ea&s;e, which proved very trouble&s;ome, and greatly debilitated the patient. Re&s;piration was now rather laborious than anxious; the &s;kin dry and hot, belly mo&s;t com|monly co&s;tive, though &s;ome had a gentle diarrhoea from the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e; no appetite, but a great de&s;ire for drink, particularly any united with ve|getable acids, as the acid of lemons, &amp;c. the adnatae of the eyes, in &s;ome, were much inflamed, &s;o that the light became &s;carcely tolerable; the countenance, on the fir&s;t and &s;econd days, in many, appeared much flu&s;hed, attended continually with a violent head ache, &s;o as frequently to produce delirium, with re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s and watchings, which greatly exhau&s;ted the patient's &s;trength; the tongue was generally dry, and in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e covered with a whiti&s;h &s;curf, and the patient complained much of anxiety, or a great &s;en&s;e of weight at the praecordia; the excrementitious di&s;charges, whether natural, or produced by art, were very fetid and di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>About the third day the inflammatory &s;ymptoms greatly changed to tho&s;e of a putrid kind, or a remi&s;|&s;ion took place; if the latter did not &s;ucceed, the tongue became dry, and began to be covered with brown or black <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ordes; not long after the teeth and lips put on the &s;ame appearance; re&s;piration became now anxious, with an increa&s;ed pro&s;tration of &s;trength: the vital functions at this time were much more di&s;|turbed; watching, or a comato&s;e &s;tate, now took place, if it had not before appeared; and even tho&s;e who did &s;leep, enjoyed it but for a few moments, when they waked as if in a fright: the pul&s;e became
<PB N="12" REF="028538_0010_0FD9380EF6BC2948">
&s;maller, weaker, and more frequent; thir&s;t was greatly increa&s;ed; nau&s;ea much more intolerable, together with the &s;en&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion at the &s;tomach: tho&s;e who had not vomited before, had that direful &s;ymptom added now to the others; the contents of the &s;tomach, which were thrown up in the act of vomiting, were generally of a fetid nature; the voice began to be changed; &s;mall petechiae appeared about the neck and brea&s;t, when the body, and even the room, unle&s;s well ventulated, had a cardaverous &s;mell. The pa|tient kept continually rolling or turning in the bed, and frequently picking the bed-clothes. In &s;ome, the bowels, at this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, were very co&s;tive, &s;o that recour&s;e was obliged to be had to artificial means, whenever it became nece&s;&s;ary to evacuate their contents: in others, a profu&s;e diarrhoea con&s;iderably increa&s;ed the weakne&s;s of their debilitated bodies. Mo&s;t generally on the fourth or fifth day of the di&s;|ea&s;e, with tho&s;e to whom it proved fatal, all the la&s;t mentioned &s;ymptoms were greatly increa&s;ed, together with a cardaverous &s;melling &s;weat, which would appear on the body, when the trunk was hot, and the ex|tremities cold: the pul&s;e became more frequent, irre|gular, and &s;ometimes intermittent: the per&s;on would lay on his back, with his knees drawn up, and his body appearing as if falling down in the bed; his voice low, and &s;carcely perceptible: he was now &s;en&s;ele&s;s of per&s;ons &s;tanding around, or any of their proceedings: the pul&s;e in this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e was &s;o weak as &s;carcely to be felt; the extremities put on a livid appearance. From the comato&s;e &s;tate, which had already taken place, the patient could hardly be rou&s;ed by the &s;tronge&s;t &s;timuli of &s;ound and light, though in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e he was &s;carcely able to bear the mo&s;t gentle; and if he &s;hould be rou&s;ed from the &s;ituation, in a few moments the &s;ame would again &s;ucceed. The urine and &s;tools were fre|quently involuntarily di&s;charged; a hiccup followed,
<PB N="13" REF="028538_0011_0FD9381064F0F090">
if it had not before taken place; and the per&s;on, in con&s;equence of univer&s;al debility producing inability to di&s;charge the natural &s;ecretion in the bronchial ve&s;&s;els, appeared as if choaking with phlegm, or &s;omething pent up in the trachea: convul&s;ions, or &s;ub&s;ultus ten|dinum, now affected the frame; the eyes put on a gla&s;&s;y appearance, and death, in a &s;hort time, clo&s;ed the &s;cene.</P>
<P>This was the general cour&s;e of the &s;ymptoms in tho&s;e to whom the di&s;ea&s;e proved fatal; but in &s;ome, they came on a little &s;ooner, in others later: in &s;ome the pe|techiae, and even maculae and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ices, extended over the body before death, though all &s;hewed evident &s;igns of putre&s;cency directly after.</P>
<P>In one per&s;on, on the afternoon of the &s;econd day, an entire intermi&s;&s;ion of his &s;ymptoms took place; on the morning of the third, they returned with increa&s;ed violence, when a vomiting came on with apthae appear|ing in the mouth and fauces. Upon taking a few drops of any thing in the &s;tomach, vomiting would immedi|ately be produced, which terminated in hiccup; this continued a few minutes; it would then &s;ub&s;ide until any thing was again &s;wallowed, when the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances returned. Petechia appeared on his neck and brea&s;t the fifth day, and as nothing could be retain|ed on his &s;tomach, he was &s;upported with gly&s;ters of broth for &s;everal days, to which, as there was no other way of admini&s;tering it, the red bark was added. The pul&s;e in this per&s;on remained good, until within a few hours of his death, when it began to dimini&s;h, weaken and become intermittent. From this time it was remark|ed any thing would remain on his &s;tomach; the hiccup cea&s;ed, and death in a few hours clo&s;ed the &s;cene. This was on the morning of the &s;eventh day.</P>
<P>In &s;ome the di&s;ea&s;e made its appearance in a more gradual manner, without any inflammatory &s;ymptoms attending it, and mo&s;t commonly tho&s;e were protracted beyond the eleventh or fourteenth days, when a remi&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="14" REF="028538_0012_0FD93816637047E8">
or intermi&s;&s;ion took place, or the per&s;on &s;unk un|der the di&s;ea&s;e. There were &s;ome who recovered, as well as tho&s;e who peri&s;hed, on whom petechial eruptions appeared; and the &s;tomach in many of tho&s;e who &s;ur|vived was very much di&s;ordered.</P>
<P>Some had other accidental &s;ymptoms accompanying the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;uch as a dry ickling cough, pains in differ|ent parts of the thorax, twith other catarrhal and pneu|monic &s;ymptoms; &s;o that &s;ome phy&s;icians were induced to declare it a &s;imple inflammatory fever and treat it ac|cordingly. In other patients a billious yellowne&s;s ap|peared over the &s;urface of the body, the ve&s;&s;els in the adnatae of the eyes were filled with bile, and attended with the other &s;ymptoms of Dr. Cullen's &s;pecies of ty|phus, the icteroides.</P>
<P>Many of tho&s;e who &s;urvived the di&s;ea&s;e were a long time troubled with rheumatic pains of a chronic nature, or a &s;mall eruption over the &s;urface of their bodies, which &s;eemed to be cau&s;ed by the debilitated &s;tate in which the di&s;ea&s;e had left them; and the eruption ap|peared to depend particularly on a weakened action of the extreme ve&s;&s;els<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Addoms's di&s;&s;ertation on the malignant fever which prevail|ed in the city of New-York during the months Aug.

from the We&s;t Indies, having a malignant fever on board; by others (phy&s;icians) it is po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted that he did not die of an imported di&s;order; but by all, I believe, it is allowed that he died of the epidemic which has &s;ince proved &s;o fatal to many.</P>
<P>The di&s;order fir&s;t made its appearance in July, at the upper end of Water &s;treet, near New &s;lip, and here it continued for a very con&s;iderable time, not &s;preading out of that &s;treet, a few in&s;tances excepted, until the month of September, after which, in &s;ome degree, it prevailed throughout the city; but ultimately proved mo&s;t mortal in the &s;treet where it commenced. Near New &s;lip there had recently been opened a &s;mall &s;treet, called George &s;treet; it had been much neglected; was very filthy, and principally inhabited by people in indigent circum&s;tances; not le&s;s than &s;ixty per&s;ons were buried out of it, within the &s;mall compa&s;s of twenty hou&s;es. The di&s;ea&s;e al&s;o proved very fatal about the Fly market, and from thence, in Water &s;treet, to the Coffee hou&s;e. The alarm became pretty general in the beginning of September, and the citizens at that period commenced removing into the country. The recent &s;ufferings of Philadelphia and Baltimore, occa|&s;ioned a greater fear of infectious fevers than would otherwi&s;e, probably, have exi&s;ted. The ha&s;ty burials after death, was al&s;o a cau&s;e of great <HI>dread;</HI> the mode was no le&s;s terrifying: For the &s;peedy removal of the dead, a hear&s;e was provided, drawn by an hor&s;e, and attended by two men. As &s;oon as the breath was out of the body, the&s;e men were &s;ent for; they u&s;ually brought a coffin and tarred &s;heet with them, in which the corp&s;e was wrapped, put into the coffin, and drove off to Potter's Field, a place purcha&s;ed for the burial of &s;trangers and the poor, and entered without the at|tendance of &s;ingle connexion or friend to bemoan their lo&s;s. It is a&s;&s;erted, and doubtle&s;s is a fact, that in many in&s;tances the hear&s;e came for the &s;ick, while yet living, and that coffins have been in the hou&s;e for &s;ome
<PB N="16" REF="028538_0014_0FD9381982B154C0">
hours before the death of the per&s;ons for whom they were de&s;tined. No excu&s;e can be plead for &s;uch pro|ceedings, but the general con&s;ternation which prevailed.</P>
<P>The fever it&s;elf did not, in many in&s;tances, occa&s;ion more alarm than the hear&s;e; as a proof of this many ca&s;es might be enumerated of women fainting away at the &s;ight of it, and being &s;ometime before they perfect|ly recovered; and in others it has occa&s;ioned hy&s;teria, and a fever &s;ucceeded. One &s;triking in&s;tance of the effect of fear, and which came within my own knowledge, was in a young woman who for &s;ome days dreaded the di&s;ea&s;e: at length &s;he was &s;eized with it, and a delirium in a day or two en&s;ued; during the whole of her in|di&s;po&s;ition, which was five or &s;ix days, &s;he con&s;tantly complained again&s;t the hear&s;e and tarred &s;heet, and al|mo&s;t her la&s;t reque&s;t when dying, was, that the family would not &s;uffer her to be buried in this manner.</P>
<P>About the middle of September, &s;ome per&s;ons, by what authority I know not, undertook burning tar one night in the &s;treets: This became a topic of conver&s;a|tion, and among tho&s;e of weak minds increa&s;ed the a|larm: in &s;hort, a coincidence of circum&s;tances like the&s;e doubtle&s;s operated to the di&s;advantage of the city, as the rumour &s;pread through the country, much exagge|rated, and thereby, in many in&s;tances prevented &s;up|plies from coming into town.</P>
<P>The &s;ufferings of the poor were great; a Lazaretto was prepared for their reception, and a phy&s;ician and nur&s;es appointed to attend them: but unfortunately great prejudices prevailed again&s;t it, and many were of an opinion that the patients did not receive proper at|tention, particularly from the nur&s;es: as I have not been able at this early period, to procure &s;atisfactory documents on the &s;ubject, I &s;hall &s;u&s;pend any animad|ver&s;ions.</P>
<P>"The Lazaretto, or pe&s;t-hou&s;e at Belle Vue, a few miles from New York, on the Ea&s;t River, has, though a healthy place, and under good regulations, been con|&s;idered
<PB N="17" REF="028538_0015_0FD9381D38981538">
by the people at large, <HI>as the hou&s;e of death.</HI>&mdash;So odious is the very idea of being placed there, that there is high probability the objection of mind atten|dant upon their getting into new quarters, and the anxiety and fatigue con&s;equent upon being moved thi|ther, have contributed, in &s;everal in&s;tances, to le&s;&s;en their chance of recovery.</P>
<P>The governors of the City Ho&s;pital gave directions, in pur&s;uance of there being a Lazaretto provided for tho&s;e &s;ick of the yellow fever, that no ca&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ed to be of that, or any other infectious di&s;ea&s;e, &s;hould be admitted into that charity. It was reported that &s;everal poor per&s;ons, who had been recommended as patients to the Ho&s;pital, were con&s;idered by the phy|&s;icians as improper, by rea&s;on of &s;u&s;pected contagion, to be admitted into the hou&s;e. In con&s;equence of re|jection there, it has happened that men, like calves and other live &s;tock, have been put upon carts at the Ho&s;pital, and drawn thence in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the doors of &s;everal of the members of the Health Committee, over the &s;tony roughne&s;s of the pavement, and under the &s;corching rays of a noon-tide fun! a procedure which &s;tirred up indignation, as well as alarm, in the citizens who &s;aw it.</P>
<P>The general anxiety, cau&s;ed by a concurrence of fearful circum&s;tances, operated &s;o powerfully upon many per|&s;ons who&s;e children were &s;tudents of Columbia College that applications for leave of ab&s;ence, in order to remove to the country, became very frequent. The &s;tudents participated the alarm of their parents and guardians, and became intent on departing. The greater part di&s;continued their attendance on the lectures, by direc|tion of their friends, and the re&s;t withdrew them&s;elves by degrees, &s;o that in a few days nobody appeared on the ringing of the bell, and the profe&s;&s;ors gave up their labours of tuition. There was never any formal ad|journment of the College. The prevailing &s;entiment
<PB N="18" REF="028538_0016_0FD9381E88E563B8">
of the board of profe&s;&s;ors was, "That no &s;uch thing ought to take place, as not warranted by any real cau&s;e of alarm."</P>
<P>Much prai&s;e is due to the Health Committee for their attention to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the poor, and it is not to be doubted, but &s;ome valuable citizens were &s;natched from the jaws of death by their timely a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. Mr. Frederick Steymets, a member of this body, fell a victim to the di&s;ea&s;e, much lamented by all who knew him. His attention in the di&s;charge of his duty was unlimited, and it is expected, will ever be remembered with gratitude by all good citizens. Capt. Buchanan, who voluntarily offered his &s;ervices to vi&s;it the &s;ick, and di&s;tribute &s;uch monies as were put into his hands by the Committee, al&s;o died of the epidemic: It is only nece&s;&s;ary to remark that this worthy man fulfil|led his duty with promptitude, and that he afforded the poor and indigent all the con&s;olation and relief that was in his power; &s;ociety has lo&s;t in him a valuable mem|ber. There are many more who&s;e &s;ervices have been of equal importance with tho&s;e already enumerated; but among the&s;e I &s;hall name one man only; a man who &s;acrificed every kind of intere&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t and relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and who&s;e philanthrophy it is hoped will ne|ver be forgotten. I refer to Mr. Levi Wayland; to enumerate his virtues would require more time than can be well &s;pared; I &s;hall therefore only remark that he was a good citizen, and a &s;incere friend: He died of the epidemic, in the 31&s;t, year of his age, on the 12th, of October.</P>
<P>Having given a &s;ketch of the principle occurrences that took place during the months of Augu&s;t, Sept. and Oct. I &s;hall next proceed to arrange the proclamations, letters, &amp;c. of the governor, Health Committee, &amp;c.</P>

<P>SOLICITOUS to quiet any unfounded apprehen&s;ion which may re&s;t on the minds of the citizens, with re|&s;pect

to the &s;pread of any malignant di&s;ea&s;e, but at the &s;ame time convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of a faithful detail of facts, as far as they have come to their knowledge. When the public is addre&s;&s;ed on this &s;ubject, the Com|mitte of Health think proper to declare, that in their opinion, no circum&s;tance has exi&s;ted in this city which ought to have occa&s;ioned the alarm which is &s;aid to have gone forth. It is true that a fever preci&s;ely like one which has twice, in the cour&s;e of four or five years been ob&s;erved, in the autumnal &s;ea&s;ons, in this place, has a|gain made its appearance. Some &s;ea-faring men have fallen victims to it. It is &s;u&s;pected to have originated on board a certain ve&s;&s;el which lay at Fitche's wharf, but of this there can be obtained no decided evidence. Notwith&s;tanding which, the ve&s;&s;el has been ordered off in the &s;tream. It is &s;u&s;pected al&s;o, but without de|cided evidence, that our late worthy health officer fell a victim to &s;ome unguarded expo&s;ure, to an infected corp&s;e on board a ve&s;&s;el. Be&s;ides him, notwith&s;tand|ing the mo&s;t diligent enquiry, we have obtained infor|mation of not more than eight deaths happening among our citizens &s;ince the 20th of la&s;t month, from fevers, &s;uppo&s;ed in any degree malignant. The number of per|&s;ons killed by the imprudent u&s;e of cold water, has been remarkable, and labourers and others actively employ|ed, ought to be frequently cautioned on this head. The Committee have taken the mo&s;t prompt and effec|tual mea&s;ures to guard the health of their fellow citizens; a hou&s;e is prepared at Belle Vue for the reception of &s;ick per&s;ons, who may be &s;u&s;pected of infection, with very agreeable accomodations, &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and medical aid.</P>
<P>All ve&s;&s;els coming from Foreign countries, from which there is any rea&s;on to apprehend the introduc|tion of infectious fevers, are now obliged to remain be|low Governor's I&s;land, until vi&s;ited by the health offi|cer, and a regular permit for their entry be granted. The citizens ought to con&s;ider it their duty individually to report to the committee, any per&s;on who may at|tempt
<PB N="20" REF="028538_0018_0FD9382548ED85C0">
to evade this precaution, that the penalty of the law may be enforced. The practitioners of phy&s;ic in the city, have been particularly reque&s;ted to be early and faithful in reporting any dangerous or &s;u&s;picious ca&s;e. A hear&s;e is provided, and may be readily ob|tained by an application to the chairman of the Com|mittee, or any one of the aldermen, for the early buri|al of the dead, whenever it &s;hall be thought nece&s;&s;ary, a practice earne&s;tly recommended during the hotte&s;t &s;ea&s;on, it being a well e&s;tabli&s;hed fact, that the body of a patient who during life could give no infection, may yet, when a corps, be &s;uddenly rendered capable of &s;o doing in a great degree. The Committee are of opinion, from taking into their con&s;ideration, the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of the health of the city, the uncommon de|gree of heat in the weather, and the lengthy period it is yet to elap&s;e, before the &s;ea&s;on arrives which is u&s;u|ally ob&s;erved to check the progre&s;s of autumnal di&s;|ea&s;es, that great care and circum&s;pection are nece&s;&s;ary. Moderation, regularity and cleanline&s;s, are e&s;pecially recommended.</P>
<P>The cleanline&s;s of the &s;treets, yards, cellars and markets, and the removal of all putre&s;cent matter, are objects of very great importance, and ought to be par|ticularly attended to, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e parts of the city, which are contiguous to our Ea&s;tern waters.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When the Committee of Health, at the commence|ment of the pre&s;ent alarm, addre&s;&s;ed to their medical fellow citizens a letter, reque&s;ting their aid and advice,
<PB N="28" REF="028538_0026_0FD9383A426D2B88">
in the execution of their tru&s;t, it was not only thought the mo&s;t prudent (becau&s;e the mo&s;t &s;ilent) but it was viewed and intended to be as re&s;pectful a mode of con|&s;ulting them as any that could be devi&s;ed. It is, there|fore, with &s;ome a&s;toni&s;hment, as well as &s;incere regret, they hear that <HI>many if not mo&s;t,</HI> of the medical charac|ters of this city have been &s;o far offended at this pro|cedure, as actually to re&s;olve to withhold the informa|tion and advice they have &s;olicited, and which is &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary to their &s;ucce&s;sful endeavours to &s;erve their fel|low citizens.</P>
<P>If this information is ju&s;t, they pre&s;ume it mu&s;t be founded on a mi&s;taken opinion, that it was the inten|tion of the Committee indelicately to interfere with the attending phy&s;ician in the examination or management of his patient&mdash;a conduct which they have &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided, and of which they believe no in&s;tance can be produced, where the attending phy&s;ician him&s;elf has given them the nece&s;&s;ary information: but where this information has been withheld, and they have received from other quarters, well atte&s;ted accounts of a dan|gerous ca&s;e, as the only means of information in their power, they have been con&s;trained to &s;end and make the nece&s;&s;ary enquiry, that they might at lea&s;t &s;ave their fellow citizens from the danger which in &s;uch ca&s;es would attend a procra&s;tinated funeral, and the neglect of proper precaution re&s;pecting the bedding, cloathing and chambers of the &s;ick, and this explana|tion, will, they make no doubt, with any candid man, acquit them of the charge of inattention or di&s;re&s;pect. But if the information they have received is founded rather in the peculiar &s;en&s;ibility of individuals, than in the impre&s;&s;ion their conduct has made on the minds of medical gentlemen in general, then it expo&s;es the pro|fe&s;&s;ion to the unmerited cen&s;ure of having &s;uffered too punctillious an attention to etiqutte to have interfered with an important and e&s;&s;ential duty.</P>
<P>At any rate, however, it is now, as it ever has been,

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The College of Phy&s;icians of New-York, re&s;pectful|ly acknowledge the receipt of your letter, by order of the Committee; and it is, "with &s;ome a&s;toni&s;hment, as well as &s;incere regret," that they find an implicati|on of cen&s;ure in the &s;aid letter, on "many if not mo&s;t of the medical characters in this city," in your &s;uppo|&s;ing they had formed a re&s;olution to withhold any ne|ce&s;&s;ary information and advice from the Committee, and which might have been nece&s;&s;ary for your "&s;uc|ce&s;sful endeavours to &s;erve their fellow citizens."</P>
<P>Whether the &s;ugge&s;tion, &s;o injurious to the practiti|oners of this city has ari&s;en from the illiberal in&s;inuati|ons of the Dean of the Faculty of Phy&s;ic of New-York, is a &s;ubject they deem highly worthy of the enquiry of the Committee, as it mu&s;t have been obvious that &s;ome of the mea&s;ures recommended by the &s;aid Dean, were calculated to defeat the important objects for which you were in&s;tituted, as they mu&s;t inevitably operate to the great injury of the unfortunate patients to be removed, the di&s;tre&s;s and affliction of his friends, and unfounded
<PB N="30" REF="028538_0028_0FD93840C24FC818">
alarm of the public, and an infraction of the laws of ho&s;pitality, and the &s;ocial compact, without drawing the attention of the citizens to the real &s;ources of dan|ger.</P>
<P>How far this implication may have been applicable to &s;ome medical characters in this city, is not for them to inve&s;tigate; but they conceive it a duty they owe to them&s;elves and to the public, to a&s;&s;ure you, that no &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions are to be found in their body; on the contrary, they have individually, after the receipt of your fir&s;t letter, communicated all the information, as well as all the ca&s;es of a dangerous nature, to the Com|mittee, which they judged nece&s;&s;ary and proper for them to know, in order for your making the mo&s;t pro|per arrangements for the pre&s;ervation of the public health, and the alleviation of the misfortunes of tho&s;e of the poor, or others who might &s;uffer dangerous &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>They &s;incerely hope that &s;uch enquiries as the Com|mittee may deem expedient to be made, will on all fu|ture occa&s;ions be conducted with &s;uch candor, deco|rum, and unequivocal information, as may not be inju|rious to the patient, di&s;re&s;pectful to the phy&s;ician, or lead to any unju&s;tifiable alarm of the public mind, at the &s;ame time pre&s;erve the dignity of the Committee.</P>
<P>They are happy, on all occa&s;ions, to avoid all tho&s;e quarrels and di&s;putes which have &s;o long di&s;graeed the Faculty of Phy&s;ic of New York, and therefore it is deemed highly inexpedient to enter into any theoreti|cal account of the pre&s;ent &s;ickne&s;s. But from all the facts that have occurred under their ob&s;ervation, they are not yet convinced that there is any thing e&s;&s;entially different in the di&s;ea&s;e, now exciting &s;uch general alarm, from what has been commonly ob&s;ervable at this &s;ea|&s;on of the year.</P>
<P>They believe, and are compelled to ob&s;erve, that the mea&s;ures recommended by the &s;aid Dean, relative to the arrangements of Belle Vue ho&s;pital, the vi&s;itation
<PB N="31" REF="028538_0029_0FD93844C3C1C6D8">
of the unfortunate patients, the interment of the dead, and &s;everal other particulars are of &s;uch a nature, as are highly intere&s;ting to the reputation of this city; and it now becomes a &s;erious que&s;tion, whether it would not be wi&s;e and prudent in the Committee to adopt new and more &s;alutary mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>They cannot but hold in abhorrence every attempt at dictatorial u&s;urpation; that there is not a member of their body who has not been regularly licen&s;ed as the law directs, and they flatter them&s;elves that they are duly &s;en&s;ible of the &s;acred nature of tho&s;e obligations, which ought to govern their conduct as practitioners; and at the &s;ame time they feel it an important and e&s;|&s;ential duty to countenance every man or body of men, labouring for the public good.</P>
<P>They al&s;o find it nece&s;&s;ary further to remark, that there are no points of "etiquette," as you are plea&s;ed to term them, which have ever been &s;uffered to inter|fere "with an important and e&s;&s;ential duty."</P>
<P>They mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h, "that no mi&s;under&s;tand|ing or trifling punctillio," may le&s;&s;en the public utility of either in&s;titution, by ob&s;tructing the channel of truth, but at the &s;ame time they think proper to &s;ugge&s;t the propriety there would be in recommending to the medical department, annexed to your body, a more cautious expre&s;&s;ion of language on the nature of the &s;uppo&s;ed prevailing epidemic; by the&s;e means the alarm will not be increa&s;ed from the &s;ource of o&s;ten&s;ible au|thority.</P>
<P>They al&s;o a&s;&s;ure the Committee of their readine&s;s on all occa&s;ions, cordially and unanimou&s;ly to unite with the Committee of Health, in their endeavours to avert or le&s;&s;en the misfortunes with which this city may at any time be threatened, by epidemics or other dan|gerous di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>I am, therefore, directed to addre&s;s to you this let|ter, and to reque&s;t you to communicate it to the Com|mittee, in which you have the honor to pre&s;ide, and re|que&s;t

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>By a proclamation of the governor of Penn&s;ylvania, dated the 31&s;t day of la&s;t month, all intercour&s;e be|tween this city and Philadelphia is prohibited for the term of one month, or until that prohibition &s;hall be revoked.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for this prohibition is thus ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the proclamation&mdash;Whereas the Board of
<PB N="34" REF="028538_0032_0FD9385091385B10">
In&s;pectors of the Health Office of Philadelphia, have reported to me, that it appears from authentic informa|tion to them exhibited, that an infectious or contagi|ous di&s;ea&s;e exi&s;ts in the city of New York, in the State of New York, and that there is rea&s;on to believe that a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e exi&s;ts in the town of Norfolk, in the State of Virginia, &s;o that the &s;afety and health of the citizens of Penn&s;ylvania require a &s;toppage of inter|cour&s;e with the &s;aid infected places, Therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This proclamation, by exciting alarms and appre|hen&s;ions throughout this and the neighbouring &s;tates, and in foreign countries, naturally tends to produce embarra&s;&s;ments to the commerce of this city; and to interrupt that intercour&s;e with the country which is at all times nece&s;&s;ary to the convenience and intere&s;ts of both. Hence it becomes important to examine and a&s;certain with preci&s;ion, whether any and what degree of credit is due to the information alluded to in the abovementioned report of the in&s;pectors of the Health Office of Philadelphia. No infectious or contagious di&s;ea&s;e can exi&s;t and prevail in this city, without the knowledge of the gentlemen who practice phy&s;ic in it; and as the greater part of them are members of the Medical Society over which you pre&s;ide, I reque&s;t the favour of you to &s;ummon a meeting of the &s;ociety, and to lay before them this letter.</P>
<P>They will oblige me by reporting to me an accurate &s;tatement of &s;uch facts and ob&s;ervations as may in their opinion be nece&s;&s;ary to the forming a right judgment relative to the exi&s;tence, nature, and extent of the di&s;|ea&s;e in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>If &s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e does really exi&s;t and prevail here, it &s;hould candidly be admitted and made known, that the dangers re&s;ulting from it may be guarded again&s;t. If, on the contrary, the reports concerning it are ill founded, care &s;hould be taken to prevent their continu|ing to gain credit.</P>
<P>Although the truth of the frequent reports made and
<PB N="35" REF="028538_0033_0FD9385180CA4D10">
publi&s;hed by the Health Committee has not been im|peached, yet as the before mentioned proclamation appears to be grounded on information more alarming than what tho&s;e reports afford, I think it advi&s;able to enquire whether it is warranted by any facts within the knowledge of the members of your &s;ociety.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE communication which you were plea&s;ed (through our Pre&s;ident) la&s;t evening to lay before the Medical Society, we con&s;ider of a nature the mo&s;t &s;e|rious and important, and the information you de&s;ire we offer with great re&s;pect, and under impre&s;&s;ions the mo&s;t &s;crupulou&s;ly con&s;cientious.</P>
<P>About &s;ix weeks ago, in a particular part of the ci|ty, being very low, and having an ea&s;tern expo&s;ure, a fever has been ob&s;erved to exi&s;t, marked by the vio|lence of tho&s;e &s;ymptoms which are acknowledged to characteri&s;e tho&s;e of the malignant &s;ort. This fever, in a &s;hort time, attacked a con&s;iderable number of per|&s;ons, in proportion to the &s;pace which it occupied, and proved fatal to more than is u&s;ual with us, and which (previous to the &s;alutary and heavy rains we have late|ly had, and the con&s;equent cloudy and cool weather) a&s;&s;umed an a&s;pect which called for, and ju&s;tified every prudent exertion that could be made to inve&s;tigate its origin, and check its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, however, the &s;en&s;ibility of the pub|lic mind, on a &s;ubject of this nature, giving reality to apprehen&s;ion, converted the nece&s;&s;ary efforts for &s;ecuri|ty and prevention into &s;ources of fear and terror. Hence probably have ari&s;en mo&s;t of the exaggerated reports which at fir&s;t alarmed our own citizens, and
<PB N="36" REF="028538_0034_0FD9385207E3CA68">
being &s;ent abroad, have excited the apprehen&s;ions of our neighbours, and given origin to mea&s;ures more timid as they re&s;pect them&s;elves, and more injurious to us, than the nature of the ca&s;e in any wi&s;e ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>The collective opinion of this &s;ociety, as the re&s;ult of attentive ob&s;ervation is&mdash;With regard to the conta|gious nature of this di&s;ea&s;e, mo&s;t of the members are of opinion that it is not contagious, and all agree that it is &s;o little &s;o, as to afford no apprehen&s;ion of its being communicated from man to man, out of the &s;phere of its original and local atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>As to its origin, &s;u&s;picions have been entertained by a few phy&s;icians, that it may have been imported, whil&s;t at the &s;ame time there are many among us who con&s;ider it as little more than that &s;pecies of fever which has more or le&s;s prevailed in this city at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, for &s;everal years pa&s;t, rendered, by the extraordinary heat, and &s;ome local &s;ources of malignity, more violent and fatal than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>If the Board of In&s;pectors of the Health Office of Philadelphia have received any information re&s;pecting the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion, other than that from the Health Committee of this city, which they deemed <HI>authentic,</HI> we are extremely &s;orry that they &s;hould have been in|fluenced by it, from a per&s;ua&s;ion that &s;uch information was equally unfounded as unauthori&s;ed.</P>
<P>We a&s;&s;ure your excellency that we have no di&s;po&s;i|tion to di&s;gui&s;e or conceal facts, nor do we he&s;itate to declare our opinion, that the alarm which has gone a|broad, has been unrea&s;onably great, and quite di&s;pro|portionate to the actual &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, which, as we have already ob&s;erved, has been confined to a very incon&s;iderable portion of the city. It affords us great plea&s;ure to be able to inform your excellency, that this complaint is fa&s;t dimini&s;hing, and that the general health of our city has been throughout the &s;ummer, and continues at this moment, unu&s;ually good.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>In an&s;wer to your excellency's letter of the 6th in&s;t. requiring from us a particular and circum&s;tantial &s;tate|ment of &s;uch facts, relative to the di&s;ea&s;e which has lately made its appearance in this city, or have come to our knowledge. We beg leave to &s;ubmit the following.</P>
<P>On the 20th day of July, Dr. Malachi Treat, the late health officer of this port, vi&s;ited the brig Ze|phyr from Port-au-Prince, on board of which he found three per&s;ons ill of fever, and the corp&s;e of one that di|ed that morning. The Doctor calls the fever in his report a billious remitting fever. The brig was order|ed to ride quarantine. On the 22d day of July. Doc|tor Treat was taken ill, and died on the 30th of a fever marked by a yellow &s;kin, hemorrhages, vomiting of a black matter, re&s;embling coffee grounds, and all &s;uch &s;ymptoms as characteri&s;e billious fevers of the malignant kind. On the 25th day of July, four per&s;ons from on board the &s;hip William from Liverpool, which arrived here &s;everal weeks before (all the crew having, previ|ous to that day, and during the voyage, been perfectly healthy) were taken ill of fever, attended with &s;imilar &s;ymptoms, and all died within &s;even days.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="028538_0037_0FD9385CE5EC57F0">
The &s;hip lay at a wharf at the foot of Dover &s;treet, in the &s;outh ea&s;terly part of this city, which lies ex|ceedingly low, is much of it made ground, has an ea&s;tern expo&s;ure, and (from the &s;treets having been rai&s;ed about three years ago, which threw the yards and lots into hollows of con&s;iderable depth) is almo&s;t unavoidably liable to great collections of offal and filth of all kinds; is a part of the town very much crouded by poor in|habitants, and contains a great number of lodging hou&s;es in which &s;eamen and &s;trangers of the poorer cla&s;s com|monly re&s;ide: and from all the&s;e cau&s;es, is unque&s;|tionably the mo&s;t unhealthy part of this city; and ever has &s;uffered mo&s;t from the regular autumnal di&s;ea&s;es as well as from any new and uncommon complaint. From all which circum&s;tances, we entertain no doubt, but that the &s;eaman of the &s;hip William contracted the di&s;ea&s;e of which they died here, and did not introduce it into this city. A little before, and immediately after the attack of the &s;eamen of the &s;hip William, which fir&s;t called the attention of this Committee, &s;everal o|ther per&s;ons in Water and Front &s;treets, and in the neighbourhood of Dover &s;treet, were &s;eized with fe|ver, which e&s;pecially in tho&s;e ca&s;es which proved mor|tal, was marked by &s;evere vomitings, a yellow &s;kin, hemorrhages, and in &s;ome ca&s;es a vomiting black mat|ter re&s;embling coffee grounds, and which generallly ter|minated within &s;even days; and proved fatal to more in proportion to the number &s;eized, than is u&s;ual in the ordinary complaints of this &s;ea&s;on, in this city.</P>
<P>From that time the di&s;ea&s;e continued to &s;pread in that neighbourhood, extending it&s;elf to a few hou&s;es lower down towards Peck's &s;lip, to one or two in Pearl &s;treet and Cherry &s;treet, but principally upwards, to|wards the &s;hip yards; the number of deaths increa&s;ing &s;lowly until the 9th of Augu&s;t, from which, to the 11th inclu&s;ive, thirteen died; from that day the num|ber of deaths reported to us have gradually decrea&s;ed, &s;o that nine only are reported to have died within the
<PB N="40" REF="028538_0038_0FD938604C56B100">
la&s;t five days; and in all, from the 30th of July to this day, eighty-nine deaths have been reported to this Committee: forty-four per&s;ons in all have been &s;ent to Belle Vue Ho&s;pital, of which the greate&s;t number have been &s;eamen and &s;trangers, who have arrived in this city, &s;ick of various complaints, and of this number, &s;everal in the very la&s;t &s;tages of their di&s;ea&s;e; twenty have died; &s;ixteen have been di&s;charged cured, and eight remains in the hou&s;e, mo&s;t of them convale&s;cent.</P>
<P>The number of deaths includes all the ca&s;es which to our knowledge have happened between the 26th of July and the 7th of September inclu&s;ive, either in this city, at the New York ho&s;pital, or at the ho&s;pital at Belle Vue, ari&s;ing from fever in the lea&s;t approaching to the character of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>And as this Committee have made every exertion in their power to obtain the nece&s;&s;ary information, they do not he&s;itate to &s;ay, that this &s;tatement is &s;ufficiently correct to afford the ba&s;is of every public mea&s;ure, which may be thought nece&s;&s;ary for our own &s;afety, or for the &s;ecurity of our neighbours.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of all intercour&s;e between this city and Philadelphia is inconvenient to them, as well as injuri|ous to us. The information which induced their Health Office to apply to their governor for this &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, was doubtle&s;s &s;uch as in their opinion ju&s;tified that mea|&s;ure. There neverthele&s;s is rea&s;on to believe that more credit was inadvertently given to it, than it de&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="028538_0039_0FD9386442A1A520">
Whether a contagious di&s;ea&s;e does exi&s;t and prevail in this city, is a que&s;tion to which a &s;atisfactory an|&s;wer can only be formed from correct &s;tatements of well authenticated facts, and the opinions of men well in|formed and meriting confidence.</P>
<P>On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, I think it advi&s;eable to ob|tain &s;uch &s;tatements and opinions, and to tran&s;mit them to the governor of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould appear from them that the u&s;ual inter|cour&s;e between this city and Philadelphia may be re|&s;tored without any danger to the latter, the prohibi|tion which &s;u&s;pends it, will of cour&s;e be revoked.</P>
<P>I have reque&s;ted and received from the Medical So|ciety in this city their report on this &s;ubject, and when to this is added the late publication of the Medical gen|tlemen who compo&s;e the &s;ociety called the College of Phy&s;icians, the &s;entiments of the faculty relative to it will be a&s;certained.</P>
<P>As the Common Council of the city is compo&s;ed of magi&s;trates and other members from the different wards and as a dangerous infectious di&s;temper cannot be pre|&s;umed to prevail here, without exciting their notice and attention; I reque&s;t from them a &s;tatement of &s;uch in|formation as they may po&s;&s;e&s;s, together with their opi|nion relative to this intere&s;ting &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The&s;e documents, with the report of the Health Committee, will afford to the governor of Penn&s;ylvania the be&s;t and mo&s;t authentic evidence that the nature of the ca&s;e will admit of; and &s;uch as cannot fail to reduce the many exaggerated reports that are in circulation, to the &s;tandard of truth.</P>

<P>On the receipt of your excellency's letter of the 9th in&s;t.

<P>It is a &s;ource of &s;incere regret to every citizen of Phi|ladelphia, that the recent intelligence from New York renders the exi&s;tence of a contagious di&s;ea&s;e in that ci|ty no longer a matter of doubt or apprehen&s;ion. We are confident, therefore, that while we cheri&s;h every &s;entiment of a ju&s;t and liberal &s;ympathy, the citizens of New York cannot di&s;approve our u&s;ing tho&s;e pre|cautions, which are nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the exten&s;ion of &s;o great a calmity. It could certainly be no allevia|tion of their &s;ufferings, that the inhabitants of Phila|delphia &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the &s;ame affliction; and your excellency will readily allow, that every embar|ra&s;&s;ment, as well foreign as dome&s;tic, that may be the effect of a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the intercour&s;e between the two cities, will operate equally again&s;t both. This con|&s;ideration of intere&s;t as well as every motive of duty, ju&s;|tice and humanity, will prompt me to &s;eize the earlie&s;t mo|ment, in which the prohibition contained in my proclama|tion may be &s;afely revoked; and I &s;hall e&s;teem any informa|tion that your excellency may be plea&s;ed from time to time

<OPENER><DATELINE>Health Office, Philadelphia, <DATE>Sep. 16th, 1795.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>In our communication to your excellency of the 4th in&s;t. we had the honor to inform you, that the in&s;pectors of the Health Office propo&s;ed a further joint meeting with the Board of con&s;ulting phy&s;icians, on the Wedne&s;day following; We accordingly met this day; the re&s;ult of our con&s;ultations we have now to detail to your excel|lency. And fir&s;t we &s;hall notice the following pa&s;|&s;age in your letter. "That governor Jay may be ap|pri&s;ed of the facts on which your opinions and reports have been founded, you will be plea&s;ed to furni&s;h me with a particular &s;tatement, to accompany my an&s;wer to his letter."</P>
<P>Previou&s;ly to our advi&s;ing the intercour&s;e between the two cities to be &s;topped, we have received informa|tion by a number of oral and written te&s;timonies, that a dangerous and malignant fever exi&s;ted in the city of New York. It will hardly be expected we &s;hould mention the names of tho&s;e per&s;ons from whom we re|ceived information, either verbal or written; to give up the names of tho&s;e we conver&s;ed with on the &s;ub|ject could an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e: and in re&s;pect to
<PB N="46" REF="028538_0044_0FD93871271BCF70">
mentioning the writers of letters, or extracts of letters, from whom we derived a con&s;iderable &s;hare of information, would we conceive be an u&s;ele&s;s as well as unpardonable breach of confidence. Suffice it to &s;ay, the informa|tion was &s;uch as on which we conceived we could &s;afely depend, and in this body of evidence it may not be ami&s;s to mention it compri&s;ed the reports of the Health Committee of New York, and letters from their port phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>The&s;e united te&s;timonies tended to e&s;tabli&s;h that the late Health Officer of the port, Dr. Treat, who con|fe&s;&s;edly re&s;ided in a healthy part of the city, on the 20th of July vi&s;ited the brig Zephyr, ju&s;t arrived from Port an Prince, on board of whom was the corp&s;e of a man who had died that day, as al&s;o three per&s;ons &s;ick of a fever, all three of whom died in a few days after; that Dr. Treat was taken ill about the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and died on or about the 30th of the &s;ame month, of a fever; the &s;ymptoms of which was of the mo&s;t malignant kind, and &s;uch as is characteri&s;tic of what is commonly called the yellow fever; that &s;hortly after the part of the crew of the &s;hip William from Liverpool were taken with a fever apparently of the &s;ame nature, and all died (in a &s;tatement &s;ince made by the Health Committee of New York and communicated to your excellency by governor Jay, we have to lament the omi&s;&s;ion of a mo&s;t material circum&s;tance; it is whether or not the brig Zephyr had any communication with the William; they only tell us &s;he was ordered to perform quaran|tine) our private information goes to &s;hew that there actually was a communication between tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els; if this information is well founded, the contagion may be readily traced from the Zephyr to the William.</P>
<P>From about this time a fever of the &s;ame nature with that of which Doctor Treat and part of the crews of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els died, was ob&s;erved to break out in a par|ticular di&s;trict of that city, confined within a &s;mall &s;pace and continuing to increa&s;e in&s;omuch that in the cour&s;e
<PB N="47" REF="028538_0045_0FD938750BE63FD8">
of the month of Augu&s;t we are told about eighty per|&s;ons (&s;ome augment this number greatly) died of the &s;ame kind of fever within that di&s;trict only: if this &s;tatement may be depended on, and we think it corro|borated by the documents tran&s;mitted by governor Jay, we have no he&s;itation in &s;aying, that the citizens of Phi|ladelphia had cau&s;e for &s;erious alarm, for it is much doubted if a greater number died in Philadelphia du|ring the &s;ame month, of the di&s;order which prevailed in, and afterwards proved &s;o calamitous to our city, du|ring the &s;ummer and autumn of 1793.</P>
<P>In both cities the di&s;order appears to have broke out about the &s;ame time of the year, and is remarkable for a &s;imilarity of progre&s;s, except that in the pre&s;ent month it has as yet le&s;s &s;pread over the city of New York than it did with us: but may not this be a&s;cribed to the plentifully rains, a cool and favorable &s;tate of the at|mo&s;phere and other natural cau&s;es which have prevail|ed this &s;ea&s;on in a remarkable degree (the rever&s;e of which was the ca&s;e in the &s;ummer of 1793) than to a le&s;s degree of malignancy in the di&s;order: be&s;ides if the con&s;titutions and habits of the citizens of New-York are indi&s;po&s;ed to imbibe the infection, are we &s;ure the Philadelphians are not predi&s;po&s;ed to take it, and would it become us as guardians of the city's health to try the experiment for the &s;ake of conviction: rather would it not be more prudent to make u&s;e of every rea&s;onable means the mo&s;t likely to avert an impending calamity; the an&s;wer is obvious.</P>
<P>It is of &s;mall moment to the point in que&s;tion, whe|ther the di&s;order was imported, or originated in the ci|ty from local cau&s;es; it is &s;ufficient to prove it contagi|ous; and that it is &s;o under certain &s;ituations and cir|cum&s;tances few will deny, who attentively con&s;ider the foregoing &s;tatement. Dr. Treat received the conta|gion from vi&s;iting the brig Zephyr, and the crew of the William received it from the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el, from whence it was imbibed by the citizens of New York,
<PB N="48" REF="028538_0046_0FD93876CBEF8AC0">
more immediately contiguous to its original &s;ources of contagion, and predi&s;po&s;ed to take the infection.</P>
<P>From the above &s;tatement we think it will be readily admitted that the di&s;order now prevalent in the city of New York, is of the &s;ame nature with that which pre|vailed in Philadelphia in the year 1793, and that in certain &s;ituations and circum&s;tances it is al&s;o contagious: if the&s;e facts are admitted, we think they will &s;uffici|ently ju&s;tify the mea&s;ures we recommended.</P>
<P>Thus we have given to your excellency the principal facts, on which were founded our opinions and reports, and our rea&s;ons for their ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the Proclamation prohibiting the in|tercour&s;e between the two cities, we have to inform you that it was the unanimous opinion of the joint Boards, that there does not now appear any rea&s;on for revoking the &s;aid Proclamation; on the contrary, con|&s;idering the prevailing hot weather, and the recent ad|vices from New York, it was our unanimous opinion, that the Proclamation &s;hould not only be continued; but that it ought to be &s;trictly carried into effect.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TWO years have not elap&s;ed &s;ince a corre&s;pondence took place between us, on a &s;ubject, the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing ever know to Americans. The dreadful calamity with which our city was then vi&s;ited, alarmed the Unit|ed States, from one extreme to the other. We became the objects of the benevolence of many of our neigh|bours, and we recollect with the mo&s;t lively gratitude, the part which the city of New York took in our afflic|tion, and the generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance we received from thence. We lament that you are now &s;uffering under

<P>Under the influence of the&s;e &s;en&s;ations the &s;um of <HI>&s;even thou&s;and dollars</HI> hath been collected among my fellow citizens, which I have the plea&s;ure of forwarding to you, at their de&s;ire, in the enclo&s;ed draft on the Bank of New York, reque&s;ting that you will be plea|&s;ed to cau&s;e it to applied to the u&s;e of the poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed of your city.</P>
<P>May a gracious providence continue the favourable change which appears already to have taken place, and &s;hortly put a period to your &s;ufferings, by re&s;toring your citizens to that happy &s;tate of health which they have been accu&s;tomed to enjoy.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I had the honor (by ye&s;terdays po&s;t) of receiving your favor of the 3d in&s;t. covering a draft on the Bank of New York in my favour for 7000 dollars, to be ap|plied to the u&s;e of the poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed of this city, in their pre&s;ent afflictions.</P>
<P>On the la&s;t evening I communicated the contents of your letter to the Health Committee, and on this day to the Common Council of the city; they heard it with heart-felt &s;atisfaction, and prompted by inclination as well as duty, I do with great plea&s;ure, at their expre&s;s reque&s;t, in behalf of our afflicted fellow citizens, pre|&s;ent to you, Sir, and the citizens of the city of Phila|delphia, whom you have the honour to repre&s;ent, our mo&s;t re&s;pectful acknowledgements for the benevolent feelings and con&s;oling &s;ympathy which you expre&s;s for
<PB N="51" REF="028538_0049_0FD9387CE60E9590">
our haple&s;s &s;ituation, and which you and they have &s;o fully manife&s;ted by the very liberal donations you have been plea&s;ed to tran&s;mit to us on this occa&s;i|on. You may be a&s;&s;ured, Sir, your benevolences will be faithfully applied, and will excite in your favour the repeated prayers and ble&s;&s;ings of many a mourning fa|ther, di&s;con&s;olate widow and helple&s;s orphan.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely lament that at &s;o early a period after a calamitous and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing pe&s;tilence had in &s;ome mea|&s;ure de&s;olated the city of Philadelphia, and excited to|wards her, in her afflicted &s;tate, the tear of &s;ympathy and the hand of benevolence of her neighbours, the Almighty Ruler of heaven and earth &s;hould have found too ju&s;t cau&s;e to remind us, that we al&s;o are beings de|pendent on his &s;overeign will, and that we have not re|quited him with gratitude for the many very &s;ignal ble&s;|&s;ings and unparalleled pro&s;perity we have enjoyed &s;ince the late revolution, and our return to our dwellings; and by this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing vi&s;itation, to impre&s;s on our minds, that under him human beings are dependent on each other, by making us in turn the objects of the commi&s;e|ration and benevolence of our &s;ympathi&s;ing neighbours.</P>
<P>I fervently hope and wi&s;h that you, &s;ir, and your re|&s;pected fellow citizens, may never again witne&s;s &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;cenes as you have lately experienced; and that the affliction which has now come to the doors of my fellow citizens, may be &s;anctified to the &s;urvivors, and teach us, that unle&s;s &s;upported by the Divine Hand the things of this life, which we &s;o highly prize, are very vanity, and life it&s;elf a mere vapour.</P>
<P>We were very &s;anguine in our expectations, about 4 weeks ago, con&s;idering the then general &s;tate of health in this city, beyond all former &s;ea&s;ons, that the epidemic which was then confined to a &s;mall di&s;trict of the city, and which &s;ince has cau&s;ed &s;o much alarm and di&s;tre&s;s, and deprived us of &s;ome valuable citizens, would have been confined there and finally &s;ub&s;ided; but the warm weather and fears of many, and want of caution in
<PB N="52" REF="028538_0050_0FD93880C4156130">
others, has cau&s;ed it to &s;pread from that quarter &s;ome|what northward and principally ea&s;tward to the &s;hip yards, where it has been mo&s;t fatal among the poor emi|grants, who lived and died in filth and dirt; and altho' the cool air of the clo&s;e of Sept. had much dimini&s;h|ed the mortality, and had given us rea&s;on to hope that the judgment would be &s;peedily removed, it has again, by the uncommonly warm weather, or perhaps unknown cau&s;es, become very alarming, and has taken off a few individuals, I &s;uppo&s;e, not exceeding 30 or 40 in the whole, &s;outh-we&s;t of the Fly market and Crown &s;treet, and we&s;t of Broad &s;treet, continued into the Bowery, exclu&s;ive of the Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>The number of deaths has however, again decrea&s;ed from 29 on Sunday evening, to 22 on Monday, and 17 on this evening (the whole number now being 525) and we have rea&s;on to hope and expect, from the &s;mall number of new ca&s;es which have come to the know|ledge of the Health Committee on the la&s;t evening, that, with the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, the di&s;ea&s;e will &s;oon &s;ub&s;ide, and permit our affrighted fugitive fellow citi|zens, who are &s;cattered in every quarter around us, to return to their dwellings in &s;afety, and again open the intercour&s;e between us, and our more happy neigh|bours; the want of which has in a very great degree enhanced our misfortunes.</P>
<P>Accept our unfeigned thanks, Sir, for the intere&s;ting and friendly part you have taken in our days of calami|ty and di&s;tre&s;s; and believe me to be with &s;entiments of great per&s;onal re&s;pect and e&s;teem,</P>

<HEAD>COMMITTEE OF HEALTH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Fellow Citizens,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>But three per&s;ons have died on the la&s;t four days in this city, and but three at Belle Vue &s;ince the 27th of October, of fever in any degree re&s;embling our late epidemic.</P>
<P>The alarming &s;ituation in which this city has lately been, is calculated to excite the mo&s;t &s;erious reflections&mdash;to in&s;pire feelings of veneration for that all control|ing Power who in the mid&s;t of &s;uch judgment numbers mercy!&mdash;We tru&s;t that it has been under a &s;entiment of grateful dependance on him, that we have been en|couraged to fulfil the duties you had entru&s;ted: And we tru&s;t that while congratulations are repeated upon returning &s;ea&s;ons of health, all hearts may be di&s;po&s;ed to improve to moral and virtuous purpo&s;es both the threatening and felicitating di&s;pen&s;ations of heaven. Your Committee at this period cheerfully recogni&s;e tho&s;e principles of undeviating veracity, which during
<PB N="54" REF="028538_0052_0FD9388908ACAC30">
the increa&s;ing terror of their fellow citizens, directed their daily reports re&s;pecting the progre&s;s of di&s;ea&s;e. It is with great &s;atisfaction that they have found it evinced by their experience, that &s;uch exact details as they have made to the public, in&s;tead of increa&s;ing tho&s;e terrors, have tended, in a great mea&s;ure, to &s;ubdue them; and the accompli&s;hment of this is of immen&s;e importance to public happine&s;s and convenience; fear mitigates its objects. During the exi&s;tence of a cala|mity of this kind, circum&s;tances will be ever exagge|rated, by the timidity and credulity of individuals.</P>
<P>It is to be lamented, however, that fal&s;ehoods have been propagated from the ba&s;e&s;t, meane&s;t, and the mo&s;t de&s;picable motives; by &s;ome as an apolo|gy for their panic apprehen&s;ious, by others, from the &s;en&s;ibilities of &s;elf intere&s;t, and to gratify a &s;ordid lu&s;t of gain. Lies have been propagated for the &s;ake of the wonderful, and the excitement of &s;urprize, by per|&s;ons ungenerou&s;ly forgetful of the exten&s;ive mi&s;chiefs naturally originating from this &s;ource&mdash;de&s;pair, de&s;er|tion, poverty, famine and death!</P>
<P>Perhaps an ill-judged tenderne&s;s for their reputati|ons has prevented the publication of the names of &s;ome offenders. Had the fal&s;ehood repeated with great confidence in the country had any proper foundation, our city would long &s;ince have been nearly de&s;olated.</P>
<P>We turn with plea&s;ure to the recollection of circum|&s;tances more creditable to hmanity; and to acknow|ledge the liberality of tho&s;e of our fellow citizens who have contributed to alleviate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the &s;ick and &s;uffering poor. The generous inteferences of &s;ympa|thy from Philadelphia, and &s;ome neighboring villages, demand our la&s;ting gratitude: Such in&s;tances of mutual good will and beneficence remain grateful memorials of the fraternity of a free and virtuous people.</P>
<P>From the&s;e re&s;ources, 8837 dols. have been received; and your Committee feel a re&s;pon&s;ibility in the faith|ful and ju&s;t di&s;tribution. Its proper objects being nu|merous,
<PB N="55" REF="028538_0053_0FD9388B0746CB00">
and often probably not within the &s;phere of individual knowledge, each of the members of the Com|mittee is a&s;&s;ociated with two re&s;pectable citizens in &s;eeking out the &s;ick, and relieving tho&s;e to whom their charity is directed.</P>
<P>Circum&s;tances have not been wanting to &s;hew the happy influence of temperance, cleanline&s;s, and cold upon the late epidemic. But while we rejoice that benevolent nature has given power to the&s;e agents to &s;et bounds to its ravages, let us recollect that they are a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to be employed. We feel it incumbent on us to remind our fellow citizens of this truth, particu|larly tho&s;e who are returning from the country. Hou&s;es which have contained the &s;ick, &s;hould be carefully ventulated; and things that have been employed by them, that cannot conveniently be clean&s;ed by water, &s;hould be &s;ubjected freely to the action of cold.</P>
<P>It is not impo&s;&s;ible that neglect in tho&s;e particulars may occa&s;ion a few &s;olitary in&s;tances of this di&s;ea&s;e un|til we have experienced inten&s;e fro&s;t. For though we flatter our&s;elves it is extingui&s;hed as an epidemic, and our &s;treets free from all infection, we have before us the experience of other places to impre&s;s the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch precautions.</P>
<P>Among the arrangements made by the Committee to prevent the &s;pread of infectious di&s;ea&s;e they con&s;ider early interments and the u&s;e of the hear&s;e, as one of the mo&s;t important. Satisfactory proofs of its utility might be detailed. It is to be wi&s;hed that the good &s;en&s;e of the community might be exerted to conquer any prejudice which may remain in oppo&s;ition to a prac|tice of burial &s;o much more convenient than the com|mon mode, and &s;o much more &s;afe.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;tate of Belle Vue ho&s;pital is plea&s;ing; not only from it we anticipate the &s;peedy extinction of all di&s;ea&s;e therein, but from the happy and comfortable &s;ituation of the &s;ick, and from the &s;atisfaction expre&s;&s;ed by them with re&s;pect to their medical aid and attend|ance.
<PB N="56" REF="028538_0054_0FD9388C3620CBD8">
But three new patients have been received dur|ing the la&s;t ten days. There are now thirteen &s;ick in the ho&s;pital, twelve of whom are con&s;idered as out of all danger. Since its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, eighty nine per&s;ons have been di&s;charged, cured; the deaths have been publi&s;hed with our daily reports.</P>
<P>It is with great &s;atisfaction that we remark that al|though &s;ome of the people have been &s;lightly affected with the epidemic no one has died.</P>
<P>Much to the injury of the unfortunate per&s;ons who have been &s;ent to this place, its circum&s;tances have been gro&s;sly mi&s;repre&s;ented. The &s;ick have in con&s;e|quence, in numerous in&s;tances, &s;ought this a&s;ylum with hearts aching with anxiety and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>A &s;enior con&s;ulting phy&s;ician was early appointed to vi&s;it it occa&s;ionally from this city. From its fir&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, one, and &s;ince the 24th of Sept. two, phy|&s;icians have con&s;tantly re&s;ided within its walls. A new building has been erected during the &s;ickne&s;s, and no expen&s;e has been &s;pared to render the &s;ick commodious and happy. A Committee from this Board have made frequent vi&s;its and examination of its circum&s;tances, and from time to time have witne&s;&s;ed with plea&s;ure its improving &s;tate.</P>
<P>A more vigilant, humane, or attentive man was ne|ver appointed purveyor to an ho&s;pital, than our late worthy member Mr. Frederick Steymets, who&s;e death reminds us of the lo&s;s of our other friend and a&s;&s;ociate, Dr. M. Treat, who there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, was al&s;o a victim to the di&s;charge of faithful duty. The public will join with us in deploring the lo&s;s of &s;uch worthy and re&s;pectable members of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Before we di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject of the ho&s;pital, it is but ju&s;t that we acknowledge our &s;en&s;e of the merit of Dr. Alexander Ander&s;on, and Dr. M'Farlin, re&s;ident phy&s;icians at Belle Vue.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The former of the&s;e gentlemen engaged with zeal and virtue, at early period and under di&s;couraging circum&s;tances, in their ardu|ous duty.</NOTE> Both for their per&s;evering
