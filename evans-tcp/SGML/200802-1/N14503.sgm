<BIBL>JOSHUA IV, 4&mdash;7.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Then Jo&s;hua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of I&s;rael, out of every tribe a man. And Jo&s;hua &s;aid unto them, pa&s;s over before the ark of the Lord your God into the mid&s;t of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a &s;tone upon his &s;houlder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of I&s;rael: That this may be a &s;ign among you, that when your children a&s;k their fathers in time to come, &s;aying, what mean you by the&s;e &s;tones? Then ye &s;hall an&s;wer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, when it pa&s;&s;ed over Jordan the waters of Jordan were cut off; and the&s;e &s;tones &s;hall be for a memorial unto the children of I&s;rael forever.</HI></Q>

<P>IT is a great truth, and highly important, that the &s;ame GOD who created the univer&s;e go|verns it. We have the fulle&s;t evidence that di|vine providence &s;uperintends all human affairs: and that, as GOD is the author of all the good which is enjoyed or &s;een in this world, &s;o there is no evil in the world and the LORD hath not done it. <HI>He forms the light and creates darkne&s;s, he
<PB N="6" REF="018381_0005_0FA703FB37087C58">
makes peace and creates evil; the LORD does all the&s;e things.</HI> Nothing comes to pa&s;s in the world, but by the ordering or permi&s;&s;ion of divine pro|vidence. It would be well if we could always maintain a &s;en&s;e of this great truth. But it is lamentably true, that we are very apt to look only at means and in&s;truments, both in mercies and judgments, and take no notice of the hand that &s;teers and conducts all things. I remember to have read a hi&s;tory of a voyage round the world, in which they who made it went through many and great perils and dangers, and were many times mo&s;t marvellou&s;ly delivered, and yet, which was a mo&s;t unpardonable omi&s;&s;ion, not the lea&s;t no|tice taken of GOD or providence. It is certainly our duty and wi&s;dom to be careful ob&s;ervers of the works of divine providence. The p&s;almi&s;t, after mentioning &s;ome of the works of providence, &s;ays, <HI>Who&s;o is wi&s;e and will ob&s;erve the&s;e things, even they &s;hall under&s;tand the loving kindne&s;s of the LORD.</HI> P&s;al. 107, 43.</P>
<P>IT is profitable, not only to ob&s;erve the occur|rences of our own day, but to read hi&s;tory, and examine the records of pa&s;t ages; to take notice of the dealings of divine providence toward for|mer generations. And while we are reading, we &s;hould not forget what the Apo&s;tle &s;ays when he had been &s;peaking of GOD's dealings towards the ancient Jews. All the&s;e things happened unto them for en&s;amples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. 1 Cor. 10. 10.</P>
<P>GOD'S dealings with the Jews are one continu|ed
<PB N="7" REF="018381_0006_0FA703FC0E722E60">
&s;eries of wonders: and great care was taken in the &s;acred hi&s;tory, to tran&s;mit the knowledge of them to po&s;terity. They are not only regi&s;tered in the &s;acred records, but God directed that there &s;hould be &s;ome vi&s;ible &s;igns, and la&s;ting monu|ments erected, to perpetuate the memory of &s;ome of his mighty acts. Thus he in&s;tituted the pa&s;&s;over, to be a memorial of the deliverance of his people out of their Egyptian bondage: and the LORD'S &s;upper, to be an everla&s;ting memori|al of the death of CHRIST, whereby we are deli|vered from a bondage infinitely wor&s;e than that of Egypt. And when he divided Jordan for his people to go over and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pro|mi&s;ed land, he directed that a monument of &s;tone &s;hould be erected, to be a memorial of this mi|raculous event, and to tran&s;mit the knowledge of it down to late&s;t po&s;terity, as we learn from our text.</P>
<P>PRESENT things &s;o engage our attention that we are apt to forget the pa&s;t; we therefore need &s;ome &s;igns, &s;ome vi&s;ible &s;igns, to be remembrancers to us. And it is well that they &s;hould be durable &s;igns; otherwi&s;e the knowledge of them will die, if not with the pre&s;ent, yet before many generati|ons are pa&s;t. The children of I&s;rael therefore were directed to erect a monument of &s;tone, me|terials which decay not with time, &s;o that if their children in after ages &s;hould a&s;k their fathers, what mean you by the&s;e &s;tones, they might an&s;wer them, that the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, when it pa&s;&s;ed over Jordan: and the&s;e &s;tones were de&s;igned to
<PB N="8" REF="018381_0007_0FA703FCB52A32F0">
be a memorial of this event. The dividing of Jordan was a very notable miracle, and worthy to be kept in remembrance.</P>
<P>But not only the miraculous works of GOD, but many other works of divine providence, both mer|ciful and corrective, are worthy to be had in everla&s;ting remembrance. There are no people but what, at one time or mother, are the &s;ubjects of remarkable providence; &s;ome of remarkable judgments, others of &s;ignal mercies and deliver|ances: the&s;e ought to be carefully noticed in the time of them, and faithful annals kept of them, that &s;o children may know what GOD did, for or again&s;t their fathers in their day. And it would be well that not only the facts them&s;elves &s;hould be regi&s;tered, but the moral cau&s;es both of mer|cies, and judgments traced out, as far as we are capable of under&s;tanding them.</P>
<P>And here lies the peculiar excellency of the &s;a|cred hi&s;tory. Many profane hi&s;torians give us a true and faithful account of the events which hap|pened in the times of which they wrote; and per|haps they point out truly the way and manner in, and means by which the&s;e events were brought on: but the &s;acred hi&s;tory, in addition to the&s;e, opens and explains to us the moral rea&s;ons, why the great governor of the world conferred this public ble&s;&s;ing, or granted this &s;ignal deliverance, or vi&s;ited his people with this &s;ore judgment. It is evident to every one who reads his bible, that GOD'S public dealing with the Jews was &s;uited to their moral &s;tate. If virtue generally prevailed among them, they flouri&s;hed and were happy; if
<PB N="9" REF="018381_0008_0FA70401E0EEB5B8">
vice and wickedne&s;s gained ground among them, they were vi&s;ited with judgments of one kind or another: and if one judgment was not &s;ufficient to reform them, GOD &s;ent more and heavier, and as he threatened, Levit. 26. puni&s;hed them &s;even times more for their &s;ins. When they reformed he lightened his hand; and when they proved fi|nally incorrigible, he gave them up to utter ruin. And GOD has, I doubt not, dealt much in the &s;ame way with other nations of the world, though their hi&s;torians have been two negligent of mak|ing ob&s;ervations. They have given a faithful narration of the notable events which have hap|pened, of the &s;ignal mercies and deliverance re|ceived, and of the calamities &s;uffered, and of the immediate in&s;truments by which they were brought about; but, which I think to have been a very great neglect, the moral cau&s;es have not been at|tended to or noticed by them.</P>
<P>IF the moral &s;tate of pa&s;t ages had been careful|ly noticed, and the con&s;equent dealings of GOD with them faithfully tran&s;mitted down to po&s;teri|ty, it would have been highly u&s;eful to us, and have had, by the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, happy in|fluence upon our own moral conduct. When we ob&s;erved that in a cour&s;e of virtue, our fathers flouri&s;hed and were happy, it mu&s;t afford a pow|erful motive to their children to immitate them in their virtues and tread in their &s;teps. When we &s;aw their failings and their &s;ufferings on that account, it would naturally tend to put us upon our guard, and make us watchful not to &s;plit upon the &s;ame rock. When we &s;aw how quick the
<PB N="10" REF="018381_0009_0FA7040504DCD3C8">
bright morning of pro&s;perity was &s;ometimes &s;uc|ceeded by a dark night of adver&s;ity, and that hours of rejoicing were followed with days, yea months of mourning and weeping, one would &s;up|po&s;e that we could not, in a time of pro&s;perity, flatter our&s;elves that our mountain &s;tands &s;trong, and that we &s;hall never be moved; that to mor|row &s;hall be as this day and much more abun|dant: but that we &s;hould live con&s;tantly depen|dant upon GOD; and that although we &s;hould re|joice in a day of pro&s;perity, yet we &s;hould rejoice as though we rejoiced not. When we took no|tice of any &s;ignal appearances of heaven for our fathers, in con&s;equence of their application to GOD and return to him, it would afford a mighty encouragement to us, to &s;ecure an intere&s;t in his &s;pecial love and favour; to cry to him in our &s;traits; and to make our peace with him by a &s;in|cere repentance, and thorough reformation. When we read the accounts of the &s;traits, difficul|ties and dangers which our fathers underwent, and took notice how they were pre&s;erved and car|ried through them, and delivered from them, it would afford the be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t &s;inking and di&s;pondency in the day of trouble; it would tend to in&s;pire us with courage and fortitude in a time of difficulty and danger. And when we took no|tice how, when they were ready to faint, GOD &s;upported them, and when they were in perplexi|ties and knew not what to do, and had their eyes unto him he appeared, and perhaps in ways un|expected, unthought of, brought deliverance to them, and &s;urprized them with it, &s;o that they
<PB N="11" REF="018381_0010_0FA70406AAD145F0">
were like men that dreamed; if any thing will, I &s;hould think this would beget a firm un&s;haken tru&s;t in GOD, under the greate&s;t trials and dan|gers; and excite us to make GOD our refuge at all times, and repair to him, who is a pre&s;ent help in time of trouble: &s;aying as in Hab. 3. 17, 18. 19. <HI>Although the fig-tree &s;hall not blo&s;&s;om, neither &s;hall fruit be in the vine, though the labour of the olive &s;hall fail; and the field &s;hall yield no meat, and the flock &s;hall be cut of from the field, and there &s;hall be no herd in the &s;talls; yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the GOD of my &s;alvation. The LORD GOD is my &s;trength, and he will make my feet like hinds feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;tudy of hi&s;tory is very plea&s;ant. There are very few, who have not &s;ome curio&s;ity to look back into pa&s;t time, and make them&s;elves acquaint|ed with what was done before they were born. And people in general are peculiarly entertained with the hi&s;tory of their own country; they are fond of knowing their own origin, and plea&s;ed to be informed of every little incident which befell their own progenitors. We view our&s;elves as parti|cularly concerned in the events which befell our par|ents; &amp; though others may take no &s;hare in them, yet children feel them&s;elves deeply intere&s;ted in them.</P>
<P>I HAVE often heard it lamented, that no more care was taken in the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this coun|try, to pre&s;erve the memory of the early tran&s;ac|tions of our forefathers, of the many hard&s;hips and difficulties they endured in this wilderne&s;s, of the perils and dangers they endured, of the &s;ig|nal
<PB N="12" REF="018381_0011_0FA70407384BDD80">
deliverances granted to them, and of the di&s;|tingui&s;hing ble&s;&s;ings conferred upon them, both of a &s;piritual and temporal nature. It cannot be expected that the hi&s;tory of a new and infant &s;et|tlement would be filled with the accounts of &s;uch armies, battles and revolutions as are to be found in the annals of ancient &s;tates and great king|doms. But however unentertaining a minute, particular hi&s;tory of New-England might be to &s;trangers and foreigners, yet it <HI>would</HI> be read with plea&s;ure by us, and it <HI>might</HI> be read with profit and advantage to us. And perhaps no country of the &s;ame age has afforded more remarkables than New-England has to &s;peak of.</P>
<P>IT is now not quite one hundred and fifty &s;ix years &s;ince our fathers fir&s;t began to form a &s;ettle|ment at Plymouth. The fir&s;t &s;ettlers were puri|tans, di&s;&s;ati&s;fied with the eccle&s;ia&s;tical govern|ment of the church of England, and &s;crupulous of conforming to the ceremonies which were in|joined in their wor&s;hip. For their non-conformi|ty they were per&s;ecuted in their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts. To e&s;cape per&s;ecution, they fir&s;t fled to Holland, and continued &s;ome years at Leyden. Di&s;liking their &s;ituation there, they concluded to remove to America. In the &s;ummer of 1620 they &s;et out on their voyage; and on the ninth of November di&s;covered the land of Cape Cod. They had de&s;igned to form a &s;ettlement further to the &s;outhward; but being brought hither, and the winter near at hand, they concluded to &s;et down here. After beating about upon the coa&s;t for divers weeks, and finding no place which
<PB N="13" REF="018381_0012_0FA70407F899E610">
&s;uited them to make a &s;ettlement in, they at length pitched upon Plymouth; and in the latter end of December they went to work to prepare &s;helter for them&s;elves, their families and goods.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;erved, as a &s;mile of heaven upon them, that contrary to their own intentions they were brought hither; had they gone further &s;outhward, as they intended, to Hud&s;on's River, the country was full of &s;avages: but here, GOD had before prepared room for them, by a &s;weeping pe&s;tilence which had depopulated the country.</P>
<P>THERE were no more than one hundred and one &s;ouls, who arrived in the harbour of Cape Cod. Winter was now &s;et in, and they were ut|terly unprovided with every accommodation: and no other Engli&s;h &s;ettlement on the continent, than a &s;mall poor colony at Virginia; they &s;ix or &s;e|ven hundred miles di&s;tant, and not able to afford them any help or relief. Under the&s;e circum|&s;tances, they mu&s;t have a mo&s;t di&s;mal pro&s;pect: Wherever they turned their eyes nothing but di&s;|tre&s;s &s;urrounded. However liberty of con&s;cience was, with them, the grand object: they could not enjoy it in England; and if they might only en|joy it here, it would make amends for all; they therefore engaged with cheerfulne&s;s, in the new &s;ettlement, and underwent incredible hard&s;hips, with fortitude; &s;oon were reduced to great &s;traits, and within five months, one half their number were dead.</P>
<P>BESIDES the natural increa&s;e, there were from time to time, &s;ome additions made to them, by the arrival of &s;ome of their friends from England.
<PB N="14" REF="018381_0013_0FA70408C7F80A00">
But although the increa&s;e was but &s;mall yet it is ob&s;ervable, that whereas divers other attempts had been before made, from purely &s;ecular views, to make &s;ettlements within what was then called North Virginia, they had failed; this &s;mall colo|ny, who were influenced by religious motives, &s;tood their ground, and were &s;lowly increa&s;ing; though greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; at &s;ometimes threaten|ed to be cut off by the Natives, at other times greatly &s;traitened for want of bread; if I mi&s;take not, never receiving any &s;upplies from Europe from the very begining.</P>
<P>THUS things went till the year 1628; when the con&s;ul for New-England, having obtained a pa|tent of the lands in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, &s;ent Mr. Endicott, with his wife and a &s;mall company, to begin a &s;ettlement at Salem. The next year, they &s;ent three &s;hips full of pa&s;&s;engers, amounting to between two and three hundred; and among them four mini&s;ters: the&s;e &s;afely arrived, and took up their habitation chiefly at Salem; though &s;ome of them &s;oon removed to Charle&s;town, and with them one of the mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>IN the &s;pring of the Year 1639, there &s;ailed from England 10 or 11 &s;hips, &s;ome of them very large, filled with pa&s;&s;engers of every u&s;eful occu|pation, with many live cattle. In this fleet, which &s;afely arrived early in the &s;ummer, were many people of &s;ub&s;tance; among whom were Gover|nor Winthrop, Deputy Governor Dudley, and many of the patentees of the colony: and I find that William Pynchon E&s;q. who was Trea&s;urer of the Colony, and father of this town of Spring|field,
<PB N="15" REF="018381_0014_0FA704097677E8A0">
was one among them. Mr. Hubbard, in his hi&s;tory, &s;ays, that about this time there was &s;uch increa&s;e made, by the occa&s;ion of many hun|dreds who every year flocked after them, that in five or &s;ix years there were twenty con&s;iderable towns built and peopled; and many of the towns fir&s;t planted became &s;o filled with inhabitants, that like bees they were ready to &s;warm into new plantations.</P>
<P>ONE of the &s;warms of which Mr. Hubbard &s;peaks, pitched in this town. It is &s;trange that any, in the then pre&s;ent &s;tate of the country, &s;hould be willing to be &s;eparated &s;o far from their breth|ren: but &s;o early as May 1635, &s;ome of the in|habitants of Roxbury, Dorche&s;ter, New-Town and Watertown prayed the General Court, (then &s;itting at New-Town, now called Cambridge) that they might have liberty to remove to Con|necticut River. This was granted to them, pro|vided they would continue under their juri&s;dicti|on. The grant is dated May 6th 1635. In con|&s;equence of this grant, the petitioners made their way, with their wives and children, into this wil|derne&s;s, and laid the foundation of the towns of Weathersfield, Hartford, Wind&s;or and Spring|field.</P>
<P>THEY that planted them&s;elves down in this town came from Roxbury. It &s;eems there were only eight men who came at fir&s;t, one of which was the before-mentioned William Pynchon E&s;q. a pattentee of the colony. They were here early in the year 1636. They entered into covenant with each other, which covenant is now upon your
<PB N="16" REF="018381_0015_0FA7040EADA80CA0">
public records; it is dated May 14th and &s;igned by William Pynchon and &s;even others, who pro|bably did not long continue here, as there is not, nor has been for many years, any of either of the names remaining among us. The fir&s;t article in the covenant was, that they would, as &s;oon as might be, provide a mini&s;ter to carry on the work of GOD among them. Though they were thus few in number, in the mid&s;t of the &s;avages, not an Engli&s;h inhabitant within twenty miles, and they now beginning a &s;ettlement, yet they re&s;olv|ed not to live without the Go&s;pel; an evidence of a true chri&s;tian zeal, which does honour to them, and is worthy of the attention and imita|tion of others.</P>
<P>THEY began well, and GOD ble&s;&s;ed their be|ginnings. Some of their friends &s;oon followed them from Roxbury; and many of the progeni|tors of the pre&s;ent inhabitants were early here: in|&s;omuch that, although at their fir&s;t &s;itting down, they did not think of having more than forty, or at farthe&s;t fifty families, yet I find by your public records, that in February 1664, there were no le&s;s than &s;eventy three male inhabitants in the town. And according to their covenant, they did early &s;upply them&s;elves with a worthy mini&s;ter, the Rev. Mr. George Moxon, who had, before he came to America, received, ordination in the church of England.</P>
<P>AT what time a church was fir&s;t gathered in the town, I cannot a&s;certain; but it appears, by your records, that Mr. Moxon was in the town in the year 1637, and continued here with his fami|ly
<PB N="17" REF="018381_0016_0FA70411D9DB9930">
fifteen years, till in the year 1652; when Mr. Pynchon, the father of the town, having received &s;ome ill treatment from the province on account of his religious principles, he with Capt. Smith his &s;on in law, went to England, and with them went the mini&s;ter of the town, the Rev. Mr. Moxon, never to return. This was a day of dark|ne&s;s with this town; I remember to have former|ly heard &s;ome of the aged people, who had it from their forefathers &s;ay, that it went near to break up the &s;ettlement. But Mr. Pynchon left behind him a &s;on, who was afterward a great ble&s;s|ing and very u&s;eful, not only here, but in the province. He lived to an advanced age, was had in the highe&s;t veneration by your fathers, and remembered by &s;ome who are now living.</P>
<P>AFTER Mr. Moxon's departure, this town was de&s;titute of a &s;ettled mini&s;ter nine years. Mr. Hooker (probably he who afterwards &s;ettled at Farmington) for &s;ome time preached to the peo|ple. One Mr. Thomp&s;on al&s;o preached among them, &s;ome part of the time; &s;o that they were not for this &s;pace de&s;titute of the go&s;pel. At length Mr. Peletiah Glover a native of Dorches|ter, came among them. I find by a note of Col. John Pynchon, that the fir&s;t &s;ermon he preached in the town was on July 3d 1659 from Jer. 4, 14. He continued officiating here till 1661, when he was ordained to the mini&s;try of the town. Mr. Hubbard gives this character of Mr. Glover, that he was a great &s;tudent, and much given to books. He lived in great harmony with your fathers, and highly e&s;teemed, till March 29, 1692, when he
<PB N="18" REF="018381_0017_0FA70413749DECC8">
gave up his charge, and the gho&s;t, and went to re&s;t.</P>
<P>IN his time that great calamity befel the town, which is the &s;pecial occa&s;ion of our a&s;&s;embling this day. From the beginning of the country, our fathers had much trouble from the natives. They were often threatening them, frequently commencing ho&s;tilities again&s;t them, and many were killed in one place and another; and indeed it is marvelous that they were not all de&s;troyed. If it had not been the LORD who was on our &s;ide, now may New-England &s;ay, If it had not been the LORD who was on our &s;ide, when the Indians ro&s;e up again&s;t us; then they had &s;wallowed us up, when their wrath was kindled, again&s;t us.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, it is to be ob&s;erved, that the peo|ple on Connecticut River lived in great harmony and peace with their Indian neighbours, till about the year 1675: When Philip's Indians, (this Philip was a great warrior, and a bitter enemy to the Engli&s;h; his place of re&s;idence was at Mount Hope, now Bri&s;tol) and tho&s;e called Nipnets, be|ing driven from the lower parts of the province, came we&s;tward; and after de&s;troying Brookfield, mixed them&s;elves with the Indians of this river, and &s;oon di&s;affected them to the Engli&s;h. The people of this town, and the towns above were a|larmed, and began to fortify and prepare for their own defence. There were now &s;ettlements form|ed at We&s;tfield, Hadley, Northampton, Hatfield, Deerfield and Northfield: though all weak&punc; and e&s;pecially the two latter.</P>
<P>THE Hadley Indians fir&s;t of all, de&s;erted their &s;ort and habitations, and joined the enemy. The
<PB N="19" REF="018381_0018_0FA704140BBD7670">
Engli&s;h who were under Captains Lothrop, and Bears were &s;o in&s;en&s;ed that they pur&s;ued them, and had a fight with them, at a place which was then, and is now called Sugar Loaf, oppo&s;ite to the town of Sunderland; wherein nine or ten of the Engli&s;h were &s;lain, and about twenty &s;ix In|dians. About &s;even days after on the fir&s;t of Sept. 1675 they be&s;et the town of Deerfield, killed one man, and laid mo&s;t of the hou&s;es in a&s;hes. Two or three days after, they made an attack upon Northfield, and killed nine or ten of the people; and the re&s;t hardly e&s;caped into the garri&s;oned hou&s;e. The next day, Capt. Bears with thirty &s;ix men was going to Northfield to &s;ecure the garri|&s;on there, when, about three miles on this &s;ide the town, he was waylaid by the enemy, and him&s;elf and about twenty of his men were killed, the re&s;t flying back to Hadly. On the eighteenth of the &s;ame month, as Capt. Lathrop, with about eighty men, was guarding &s;everal carts, laden with corn and other goods, from Deerfield to Hadley, they were &s;uddenly attacked, and almo&s;t all cut off, not above &s;even or eight e&s;caping. On the &s;pot where they were buried, at a place called Muddy-Brook, was erected a monument of &s;tone, which now re|mains.</P>
<P>THESE things gave &s;ome alarm to the inhabi|tants of Springfield: though they were loath to di&s;tru&s;t their own Indians, with whom they had lived in great peace and amity for the &s;pace of near forty years. However they were not whol|ly unprovided: they had &s;ome garri&s;ons, though I believe, not more than three in the town. The
<PB N="20" REF="018381_0019_0FA70414C0F842B0">
inhabitants treated with the Indians, and received from them, the firme&s;t a&s;&s;urance of their friend|&s;hip: and the Indians gave &s;ome ho&s;tages as a &s;ecurity for their peaceable behaviour; which ho&s;|tages were &s;ent to Hartford, there to remain. The&s;e ho&s;tages made their e&s;cape; and three hun|dred of Philip's Men were &s;ecretly received into the Indian fort upon Long-Hill. Their de&s;igns again&s;t the town were revealed by a Wind&s;or In|dian who&s;e name was Toto; tidings of which, were in all ha&s;te &s;ent to Springfield in the night: otherwi&s;e the inhabitants of the town probably had been cut off, as well as their &s;ub&s;tance di&s;|troyed. The town was thrown into great con|&s;ternation, by the alarming advice from Wind&s;or, and fled to their garri&s;ons for &s;afety. But two men, more unbelieveing than the re&s;t, (on the morning of the 5th of October 1675, according to old &s;tile, now the 16th, this day one hundred years &s;ince) re&s;olved to go to the Indian fort, and &s;ee whether the&s;e things were &s;o. They &s;et out; but had not come to Mill-River, before the Indians fired upon them, killed one on the &s;pot, and mor|tally wounded the other: However he got back to a fort at the lower end of the &s;treet, and &s;oon died. The Indians immediately &s;et fire to the ungarri&s;oned hou&s;es, and to the barns; and on that day laid almo&s;t the whole town in a&s;hes.</P>
<P>DEACON Burt, who was an eye witne&s;s, in a note made in the book of records, to purpetuate the memory of this melancholy event, &s;ays there were 29 dwelling hou&s;es burnt; the number of barns he does not a&s;certain. Major, afterwards
<PB N="21" REF="018381_0020_0FA7041578EAA9D8">
Col. John Pynchon, who a few days before went to Hadley with a few &s;oldiers to take care of the people in tho&s;e parts, in a letter which he wrote 15 days after the di&s;truction of the town, to his &s;on Jo&s;eph then in England, gives a mo&s;t melan|choly account of their &s;tate; he &s;ays there were about 30 or 32 dwelling hou&s;es burnt, and 25 barns full of corn and hay; and that although his own dwelling hou&s;e was &s;pared, his mills and barns and out hou&s;es were all con&s;umed, with all his corn and hay; &s;o that he had nothing left for food for man or bea&s;t. This letter I have in my hands; and it breathes &s;uch a quiet, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, patient, excellent &s;pirit, that were there time, I would read the whole of it to you. Doctor Mather &s;ays, there were above 30 dwelling hou&s;es, and above 20 out hou&s;es burnt. Mr. Hubbard &s;ays 32 hou&s;es were con&s;umed. Whether any build|ings in this part of the town, except the fortified hou&s;es, were &s;aved, I am uncertain. Major Treat &s;oon came from We&s;tfield for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but for want of boats, could not pa&s;s the river. Major Pynchon with &s;ome forces from Hadley was with them as quick as po&s;&s;ible, but too late to &s;ave the town.</P>
<P>BESIDES the two already mentioned, there was one woman killed, and &s;everal men wounded, one of which died &s;oon after. There were &s;ome few inhabitants at Long-Meadow and I &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river; both the&s;e e&s;caped.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to &s;ee that this was a di&s;mal day with the forefathers of this town; that they were re|duced to great di&s;tre&s;s. It came upon them at a
<PB N="22" REF="018381_0021_0FA704165AB95AB8">
&s;ea&s;on when all the fruits of the earth were gather|ed in; &s;o that there year's &s;tock of provi&s;ion was con&s;umed, and they had little or nothing left for man or bea&s;t; and none near them had any thing to &s;pare to them. However, they did not faint: by the good providence of GOD they were carried through the winter. It was &s;aid by the ancient peo|ple, that the following winter was remarkably fa|vorable; in&s;omuch that they plowed their lands in the mid&s;t of winter. The town was &s;oon rebuilt, and returned to its former &s;tate; and has never &s;ince, &s;uffered greatly by the Indians.</P>
<P>THERE was afterward a <HI>Leonard</HI> killed on the we&s;t &s;ide of the river; I &s;uppo&s;e it was the father of tho&s;e of that name who now re&s;ide there. At Pecow&s;ick were &s;ix killed, the &s;pring following the de&s;truction of the town, three outright; two women with their children, who were captivated, were overtaken, and one woman with the chil|dren killed; the other woman wounded, but re|covered, and lived to an advanced age. And within the memory of &s;ome of you, (July 26 1708) three per&s;ons were killed in one hou&s;e, at Skip|mug; and a fourth that was captivated was &s;oon after killed, and a lad, Benjamin Wright. Be&s;ides the&s;e, I do not know that the Indians have done any other mi&s;chief, except wounding one or two per&s;ons, and captivating a few.</P>
<P>THERE was, in the winter or &s;pring following the de&s;truction of the town, a youth of the name of Edward Stebbins, (the grandfather of &s;ome here pre&s;ent) taken captive by the Indians at Long-Meadow; which, becau&s;e it was attended with
<PB N="23" REF="018381_0022_0FA70416F4E08B78">
&s;ome important con&s;equences, I particularly men|tion. He was carried to the Indian head-quar|ters, which were then at the falls in this river a few miles above Deerfield. This youth with a|nother who&s;e name was Gilbert, found means to make their e&s;cape, and gave notice of the Indians place of rendezvous, and of the &s;ecurity in which they lived. Whereupon Capt. Turner, who, I take it, had the command of the &s;oldiers in the garri&s;ons, and Capt. Holyoke of this town, col|lecting about 150 men, partly out of the garri&s;ons and partly from among the inhabitants, went a|gain&s;t them: and a little before break of day on the 19th of May 1676, fell upon the Indians un|di&s;covered, fired into their wigwams, and killed many on the place, many others in their fright plunged into the river, were carried headlong down the falls, and peri&s;hed in the waters; and many who took &s;helter under the bank of the ri|ver were killed with the &s;words of our men. Mr. Hubbard &s;ays, that Capt. Holyoke killed five here with his own hand. We lo&s;t 38 men in this fight: and &s;ome of their pri&s;oners afterward own|ed, that they lo&s;t more than 300, &s;ome of them principal men, Sachems, and &s;ome of their be&s;t warriors. It is ob&s;erved, that they never reco|vered this defeat, but their ruin immediately fol|lowed. In reward of this &s;ignal &s;ervice, a town|&s;hip of land where the fight was, now called Bar|nard&s;ton, was granted to their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>I cannot find that more than ten or twelve per|&s;ons have been killed by the Indians, within the limits of this town: &s;ave that Mr. Hubbard &s;ays,
<PB N="24" REF="018381_0023_0FA7041A966C0D20">
&s;ix or &s;even of our people, after our mills were burnt, going to mill at We&s;tfield, and going with out arms, three of them were killed by the ene|my. I have not been able to get any account who they were, nor any further account of this matter.</P>
<P>BUT the town has laboured under other, and grievous calamities at divers times. It is a grie|vous and mortal &s;ickne&s;s which is now among us, and has put many parents into mourning. In the year 1760 and 1761, we were vi&s;ited with a &s;ore fever, which took of many u&s;eful and valuable men, in the mid&s;t of their u&s;efulne&s;s, and greatly weak|ened our &s;trength. But the mo&s;t de&s;tre&s;&s;ing time the town ever &s;aw by rea&s;on of &s;ickne&s;s, was in the year 1683, eight years after the town was burnt, (which by the ancient people of the town, was called the &s;ickly winter) when a violent fe|ver raged in the town, to that degree that there were &s;carcely enough well to tend the &s;ick; the public wor&s;hip was for &s;ome time &s;u&s;pended, and twenty grown per&s;ons died. In the year 1711, there was al&s;o a mortal &s;ickne&s;s which in the win|ter &s;ea&s;on raged here, greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the people, and carried off a number of the principal men. It was a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing time with you in the year 1733, when your worthy Pa&s;tor, and my Rev. Father &amp; immediate predece&s;&s;or, Mr. Brown, after having &s;erved you in the work of the mini&s;try forty years, died, and with him a number of worthy men. Mr. Brewer was ordained your mini&s;ter May 16, 1693, and continued with you till Nov. 5th, 1733, when he departed this life.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="018381_0024_0FA7041B7526F2E8">
To him through the providence of GOD, I though unworthy &s;ucceeded. The fir&s;t &s;ermon I preached was on the 26th of May 1734. I re|ceived ordination January 27th 1735, 6: And though exerci&s;ed with much weakne&s;s and many infirmities, yet having obtained help from GOD, I continue until this time. I &s;uppo&s;e, I have liv|ed with you longer than either of my predece&s;&s;ors; and longer than any mini&s;ter in any part of the town, except the Rev. Dr. Williams, who is here pre&s;ent in the 83d year of his age, and has nearly compleated the 59th year of his mini&s;try; in a comfortable &s;tate of health, and full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his intellectual powers, he promi&s;es to be u&s;eful for years yet to come.</P>
<P>SINCE my entrance into the mini&s;try here 476 have died, 1034 have received bapti&s;m, 298 have been admitted to full communion; there are only four, who are now living and continue with us, that were communicants at the time of my ordina|tion. My work is near to an end: may I a&s;k your prayers, that I may be u&s;eful while I live, faithful to death, and then receive the crown of life.</P>
<P>THIS town is now 131 years old. The fir&s;t &s;ettlers expected that the town would contain only 50 families at the mo&s;t: but I pre&s;ume there may be, at this day, 600 within the ancient limits of Springfield.</P>
<P>THE town was early divided into two pari&s;hes. In June 1698, a church was gathered in the 2d pari&s;h, and Mr. John Woodbridge ordained their Pa&s;tor. He continued 20 years in the mini&s;try, &amp; died in June 1718. To him &s;ucceeded the Rev. Samuel Hopkins, who was ordained pa&s;tor June

1&s;t, 17<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">0, and died October 6, 1755: a truly wor|thy man, and much beloved and e&s;teemed. On the 25th day of the following Augu&s;t, the Rev. Jo&s;eph Lathrop was ordained, pa&s;tor of that church: he &s;till lives, and has entered upon the 20th year of his mini&s;try.</P>
<P>ON Feb. 17, 1713 Long-Meadow was made a pari&s;h: on the 16th of October <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a church was gathered there, and the Rev. Stephen Williams was ordained their pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>ON June 24th 1741, a church was gathered in the fourth pari&s;h in Springfield; and the Rev. Noah Merick was ordained their pa&s;tor. He is &s;till living. This pari&s;h was made a town in the year 1763</P>
<P>ON Sept. 27, 1752, a church was gathered in a fifth pari&s;h in the town; and the Rev. John Mc. Kin&s;try was ordained their pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>ON Nov. 10, 1762 a church was gathered in a &s;ixth pari&s;h in Springfield; and on the 17th the Rev. Silvanus Gri&s;wold was ordained their pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>ABOUT two years &s;ince, another di&s;trict was made in the town, by the name of Ludlow, which remains de&s;titute of a &s;ettled mini&s;ter. So that there are now, within the ancient limits of this town, &s;even wor|&s;hiping a&s;&s;emblies, be&s;ides one who profe&s;s them|&s;elves Bapti&s;ts.</P>
<P>HOW greatly are we increa&s;ed beyond the ex|pectation of our forefathers? The fir&s;t &s;ettlers of the town, were they now upon earth, might with propriety adopt the language of Jacob and &s;ay, with our &s;taves pa&s;&s;ed with through this wilderne&s;s, and now we are become, not two, but &s;even bands.</P>
<P>MAY we be &s;uitably affected with all the deal|ings of divine providence towards our fathers and
<PB N="27" REF="018381_0026_0FA7041C3794C280">
us, both merciful and corrective. We have mer|cies to &s;peak of as well as judgments: we have enjoyed the go&s;pel from the beginning; have had as much health as mo&s;t towns; and perhaps no town has enjoyed more internal peace, with fewer interruptions, than the ancient town of Springfield. Though we have been divided into &s;everal pari&s;hes, for many years, and have had di&s;tinct intere&s;ts; yet from my earlie&s;t acquaintance with the town, your fathers looked upon one another as brethern, and regard to the public intere&s;t was the govern|ing principle. I have ever thought it a very hap|py circum&s;tance, that the leading men of this town have, from time to time, been not only men of ability, but really friendly, both to your civil and religious intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>FOR my own part, I have ever e&s;teemed it a &s;mile of Providence, that my lot was early ca&s;t in the town of Springfield; and hope I may never have occa&s;ion to change my &s;entiments. I came here in my youth, not 21 years of age; and &s;hall ever retain a grateful remembrance of the candor with which your fathers treated me, and many kind offices which they did me. But few of that generation remain. They are in the grave: and I cannot forbear droping a tear at the remem|brance of them. They were a worthy &s;et of peo|ple: but they are gone; and this place which has known them, &s;hall know them no more. And the children are ri&s;en up in the &s;tead of their fa|thers: may you, my dear people, prove your&s;elves worthy of &s;uch ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>How &s;hort is human life? How quick does one generation &s;ucceed another? there are now
<PB N="28" REF="018381_0027_0FA7041D60F7CDD8">
upon the &s;tage, &s;ome of the eighth generation of the family of the Pynchons in 139 years. My brethern, former generations are pa&s;&s;ed away, and this pre&s;ent generation mu&s;t &s;oon follow them, and make way for others. Within a few years, every &s;ingle per&s;on in this a&s;&s;embly will be in the grave. It is extreme folly in us, to &s;et our hearts upon a world we mu&s;t &s;o &s;oon leave; and it is our highe&s;t wi&s;dom to lay up trea&s;ure in heaven; and prepare for that eternal &s;tate, which &s;ucceeds this &s;hort life.</P>
<P>HOWEVER though we &s;hould not be careful of the many things of this world, to the neglect of the one thing needful, yet our pre&s;ent pro&s;perity and happine&s;s is not to be wholly overlooked. And we ought to carry our views beyond the time of our own continuance here, and confe&s;s the good and happine&s;s of tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;ucceed us on the &s;tage of life. If we regard the happine&s;s of po&s;terity, let us take care to give our children a religious education, and fit them to act their part well upon the theatre of the world, after we are retired to re&s;t and &s;leep with our fathers.</P>
<P>NEW-ENGLAND has &s;een days of pro&s;perity, they have al|&s;o had their &s;ea&s;ons of adver&s;ity. In their troubles, they tru&s;ted in GOD, and he has repeatedly granted them &s;ignal deliver|ances. Our fathers greate&s;t troubles were from the Natives, who, by the in&s;tigation of the French were often in&s;erting our frontier &s;ettlements. And multitudes have died by their barbarous hands.</P>
<P>When, by the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD upon our arms, in the la&s;t war with France, Canady was &s;ubjected to the obedience of the Crown of Great-Britain, we were ready to flatter our&s;elves that our troubles were at an end; and that now we &s;hould en|joy continual &s;un&s;hine and peace: but the clouds are &s;oon ga|thered again. It is now a day of darkne&s;s, not only with New-England, but the cloud has over&s;pread all America: though <HI>we</HI> may expect to bear the weight of the &s;torm. Let us fol|low the good example of our pious progenitors: wait upon the LORD, and &s;ee to it that our ways plea&s;e him, and we may hope that he will cau&s;e the enemies of America to be at peace with us.</P>
