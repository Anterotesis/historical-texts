<HEAD>To my Friend in the Country.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE new Method of receiving the Small-Pox by <HI>Inci&s;ion</HI> (or <HI>Inocu|lation</HI> as 'tis commonly call'd) has been, you know, the Subject not only of plentiful Di&s;cour&s;e, but of angry Debate and fierce Contention among us in this Town. And it is a very unhappy Circum&s;tance attending us here, that almo&s;t every thing that is now done or doing among us, if it be at all of a publick nature, creates Heats and Animo&s;ities. I am in hopes our good People will by and by be &s;en&s;ible of the folly and mi&s;chief of this, and come to &s;uch a Temper as will &s;uffer them to <HI>differ</HI> from one another without being <HI>angry</HI> with one another. In the mean time&punc; I hope that the People in other Towns where
<PB N="2" REF="002247_0003_0FDAD97D8CEFFB30">
the Di&s;temper has made its Entrance, will pre|&s;erve a better Temper, if any among them &s;hould put this Method into Practice.</P>
<P>HOWEVER &s;ome among us may appear again&s;t it out of Party and Prejudice, or make an <HI>Engine</HI> of it to &s;erve De&s;igns, not friendly to the Peace and true Intere&s;t of the Place, yet there are many who are <HI>Con&s;cientiou&s;ly</HI> aver&s;e to it, I believe; and, if the&s;e pre&s;erve the <HI>Meekne&s;s of Wi&s;dom,</HI> they are (as a <HI>very Reverend Per&s;on</HI> has lately &s;aid of them) greatly to be commended and honour'd in that they will not act again&s;t a doubting Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>I perceive that the Scruples and Objections commonly offer'd by People here, have &s;uch a force upon your Mind, as keeps you from going into this Method which may be your Safety and Pre&s;ervation. Now <HI>Friend&s;hip,</HI> (the Offices of which &s;hould be &s;acredly re|garded by us,) obliges me to attempt to re|lieve and help you, in a Matter wherein your <HI>life,</HI> &s;o precious in it &s;elf, and de&s;erv|edly dear to me, is &s;o much concerned.</P>
<P>FOR Satisfaction about the <HI>Safety</HI> of this Method in an <HI>ordinary way of Providence,</HI> together with the <HI>Ea&s;ine&s;s</HI> of it, I refer you to the <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> on it made and publi&s;h'd by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Colman;</HI> of the greate&s;t part of which Matters of Fact by him related, I have my &s;elf been an Eye witne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002247_0004_0FDAD97F4D3E5D98">
BUT that which you want Satisfaction about is, the <HI>Scruples</HI> and Objections of a <HI>Con&s;cientious</HI> or Religious Nature, which are commonly offer'd by People again&s;t this Method, The&s;e, I &s;hall endeavour to an&s;wer and re&s;olve, as I am able, in a few words; and if they afford you any Light or Satis|faction re&s;pecting the &s;ame, you may com|municate them to whom you plea&s;e; and if it &s;hould be tho't worth while to make them public, I think none can cen&s;ure me for &s;tarting out of my Line, or medling with what is none of my Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ince the thing I am now upon relates to <HI>Religion and Con&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P>ONE great thing urg'd again&s;t this Practice is, <HI>That it is not lawful for me to make my &s;elf &s;ick when I am well: Or voluntarily to bring a Di&s;temper upon my &s;elf.</HI> To bring Sickne&s;s upon ones &s;elf for its own &s;ake, is what no Man in his right wits would do. But to make my &s;elf Sick in <HI>&s;uch a way,</HI> as may probably &s;erve my Health, and &s;ave my Life, and with &s;uch a <HI>De&s;ign</HI> is certainly fitting and Rea&s;ona|ble, and therefore lawful. This is every day practis'd among People without any Scruple, in Purges and Vomits, and other things in Medical U&s;e. Now, if I may lawfully make my &s;elf Sick by taking &s;omething in at my <HI>Mouth,</HI> why not by putting &s;omething in at my <HI>Arm?</HI> Or, if I may lawfully make my &s;elf Sick for <HI>one day,</HI> why not for <HI>two days,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="002247_0005_0FDAD98087CBAAA0">
or more, as the Ca&s;e may require? Aye, but this is to bring a <HI>Di&s;temper</HI> upon my &s;elf. I think it can <HI>hardly be call'd</HI> bringing it upon my &s;elf, when the Ca&s;e is &s;o with me, (not having had the Di&s;temper, and living in an infected Air) that I can't but expect to undergo it in a very little time. I know indeed GOD can pre&s;erve me from the In|fection, but when my Neighbours all round me are vi&s;ited, I know of no <HI>Warrant</HI> that any particular Per&s;on has to expect an <HI>extraordinary Pre&s;ervation.</HI> He that has no rea&s;on to think, but that he is as liable to the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> as other people are, and yet keeps in the Way of it, <HI>expecting that God will pre&s;erve him untouch'd,</HI> however &s;ome may give it the Name of Tru&s;t and Faith, and the like, I cannot but look upon it and call it <HI>Pre&s;umption.</HI> In &s;hort, I can't but think, when I am in &s;uch Circum&s;tances, that I cannot <HI>rationally</HI> nor <HI>warrantably</HI> expect to e&s;cape the Di&s;temper, it is <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> lawful for me to bring upon my &s;elf a <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> Degree of it, to prevent a <HI>greater.</HI> I'll put the Ca&s;e thus, If I have not had the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> it is to be &s;up|po&s;ed, there is in my body, what I'll call the <HI>Fuel</HI> of that Di&s;temper, and there only wants the lighting of a <HI>Spark</HI> to &s;et this Fuel on burning. The <HI>Air</HI> I breath in is full of the&s;e Sparks; and I may expect <HI>every Breath I fetch</HI> to draw &s;ome of them in: If now it appears upon daily Experience, that making an In|ci&s;ion in my <HI>Arm,</HI> and letting the Spark in that way, the Fuel will burn with le&s;s fiercene&s;s
<PB N="5" REF="002247_0006_0FDAD9820A01E3C0">
and con&s;equently danger; why may'nt I take it in that way? Why mu&s;t I needs &s;tay till it come in at my <HI>Mouth</HI> or <HI>No&s;trils,</HI> or thro' &s;ome of the <HI>porous Parts</HI> of my body? For my part, I think the Law of <HI>Self-Pre&s;ervation,</HI> which is <HI>GOD's Law,</HI> requires me to take this Method of Safety, whereby (to u&s;e the apt Words of another,) the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> is, thro' GOD's common Ble&s;&s;ing, happily converted into a <HI>Remedy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WHAT then, will you not wait GOD's Time for it?</HI> They a&s;k. I think <HI>then is the Time</HI> Providence calls me to this Method of Safety, when I am in imminent and <HI>immediate</HI> danger of the Di&s;temper the other way. Should any one go into the Practice of Inoculation, out of a fancy or <HI>Bravado,</HI> without his being in known hazard of the Di&s;temper by the common way of Infection, I &s;hould not think it warrantable. But <HI>then is GOD's time</HI> for us to u&s;e means of Safety, when we are in <HI>apparent danger</HI> of any deadly or de&s;tructive Evil.</P>
<P>BUT then, 'tis a&s;k'd again, <HI>What can't you tru&s;t GOD?</HI>&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e every body will allow that the U&s;e of Means is not incon&s;i&s;tent with Tru&s;t in GOD; and why there can't be Tru&s;t in GOD in the U&s;e of <HI>this</HI> means, as well as other, I cannot imagine. <HI>Why, it is a going from GOD to Man,</HI> &s;ome &s;ay. What then, can't we make U&s;e of Men and Means in a time of danger without going from GOD? If any,
<PB N="6" REF="002247_0007_0FDAD98D18C4F910">
like <HI>A&s;a,</HI> look to the <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> and <HI>not to the LORD&punc;</HI> they are very irreligious and profane therein. But if any do <HI>principally</HI> and in the fir&s;t place &s;eek to GOD, may they not then innocently and lawfully make u&s;e of the <HI>be&s;t humane help</HI> the Providence of GOD affords them? I mu&s;t profe&s;s and declare on the part of many of the Inoculated, that they and their Friends concern'd in them, have gone into the Practice with <HI>many Prayers</HI> to GOD, and other &s;uitable expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Tru&s;t and Devotion.</HI></P>
<P>BUT &s;till &s;ome &s;ay, this Practi&s;e looks to them like <HI>taking God's Work out of His hand.</HI>&mdash;Indeed this Di&s;temper can arre&s;t none without a Commi&s;&s;ion from God. But yet it is not inflicted by God's <HI>im|mediate hand;</HI> we receive it in a <HI>natural way,</HI> and by means of <HI>&s;econd Cau&s;es;</HI> and <HI>this we do in the Way of Inoculation,</HI> as well as of common Infection. If we have the Small Pox in either of the&s;e ways, it is &s;till the Work of God: For all &s;econd Cau&s;es depend on and act under Him the fir&s;t Cau&s;e. And, <HI>the Application of Means natural for this or that End, is it not an Application to the God of nature?</HI> If God does not co-operate by His <HI>actual Providence</HI> can the Effect be produc'd? For, <HI>who is he that &s;aith, and it cometh pa&s;s, when the Lord commandeth it not?</HI> What is there of the hand or <HI>power of Man</HI> in this Work, after the Inci&s;ion is made and the matter apply'd? The <HI>Work is
<PB N="7" REF="002247_0008_0FDAD98E13D80848">
&s;till left with God,</HI> and we mu&s;t wait upon Him for His actual Influence and Ble&s;&s;ing, even as the Hu&s;bandman does for the Rain and Shines of Heaven, after the Seed is thrown into the Earth.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>the Small Pox is a Judgment of God, &s;ent to puni&s;h and humble us for our Sins; and what &s;hall we &s;o evade it, and think to turn it a|way from us?</HI> I fully agree to it, that it is a &s;ore Judgment of God upon us for our Sins, which we have much de&s;erv'd: And it is greatly to be lamented that it has no better Effect upon the hearts of Men&mdash;. But is it Unlawful to u&s;e means for our Pre&s;ervation from a de&s;olating Judgment? <HI>E&s;pecially,</HI> if at the very time that God &s;ends the Judgment, He &s;hews us a way to e&s;cape the <HI>Extremity</HI> and De&s;truction at lea&s;t, if not the Touch of it. If a gracious God &s;hews us &s;o much <HI>Mer|cy</HI> as this under the Judgment, does it become us to <HI>put it away from our &s;elves,</HI> or rather &s;hould we not accept it with <HI>Adoring Thank|fulne&s;s?</HI> If this Town was to &s;uffer an <HI>In|undation,</HI> that would be a more terrible Judg|ment than this, and we &s;hould look upon it too as a righteous Puni&s;hment for our Sins; yet would any refu&s;e to make u&s;e of a <HI>Boat,</HI> or a <HI>Plank that might providentially come in his Way,</HI> thinking that to do it would be a crimi|nal Evading the Judgment? <HI>I trow not,</HI></P>
<P>BUT, &s;ome have &s;aid to me, <HI>This Method tends to take off the fears of this Di&s;temper from the Minds of people; and who knows of what
<PB N="8" REF="002247_0009_0FDAD98F9DDDA140">
Spiritual Advantage the&s;e fears might be to them?</HI> In An&s;wer to it I a&s;k them, Whether GOD cannot make the <HI>Mercy</HI> of their Pre&s;ervation and Recovery in this Way of Spiritual Advan|tage to them al&s;o, and by that <HI>lead them to Repentance?</HI> And, I truly hope, the Salva|tion of GOD be&s;tow'd upon &s;ome in <HI>this way,</HI> as well as the other, will have a gracious &s;anctifying Effect upon them, under the powerful working of the Spirit of Grace. I was glad to &s;ee the &s;erious Frames <HI>&s;ome of them</HI> were in at the very time, how much affected they &s;eem'd to be with the favour of GOD to them; what a good Profe&s;&s;ion of holy Re&s;olution, &s;ome of them made. And I would take this Opportunity to call upon them from GOD to remember the &s;ame, and to be <HI>daily performing their Vows.</HI></P>
<P>SOME <HI>Object</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Practice</HI> becau&s;e of the <HI>Unhappy Con&s;equent</HI> of it among us; <HI>the Feuds and Contention, Sin and Mi&s;chief that it has occa&s;ion'd.</HI>&mdash;Of this, I hope, I am a mournful Spectator; And it has made me &s;undry times ready to take up that Wi&s;h, <HI>Oh that I had Wings like a Dove!</HI> And I mu&s;t freely declare, that I look upon that Spirit of Party and Divi&s;ion that is reigning among us, to be a &s;orer Judgment of GOD upon us, than the Di&s;temper which has &s;o di&s;tre&s;s'd us. But yet, I am far from thinking that the <HI>Badne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>thing</HI> in it's &s;elf is to be argu'd or infer'd from this <HI>Effect</HI> of it. For does
<PB N="9" REF="002247_0010_0FDAD99410B396C8">
not the &s;ame Effect attend many other things unque&s;tionably <HI>good</HI> in them&s;elves; &s;uch as the building of Hou&s;es for the Wor&s;hip of GOD, the Choice of Mini&s;ters, and of Per&s;ons to &s;erve in the State, &amp;c? Nay, the very preaching of the Go&s;pel in the World, tho' it be the Go&s;pel of <HI>Peace,</HI> and the Go&s;pel of <HI>Salvation</HI> too, has been, and is, <HI>accidentally,</HI> thro' the Corruption of Mens hearts, and under the Influence of the envious Enemy of Mankind, the Occa&s;ion of all this; according as our Saviour has foretold that it would be, &s;ay|ing as Mat. 10. 34, 35. <HI>Think not that I am come to &s;end Peace on Earth: I came not to &s;end Peace but a Sword. For I am come to &s;et a Man at variance again&s;t his Father, and the Daughter again&s;t her Mother, and the Daughter-in-law again&s;t her Mother-in-law. And a Mans foes &s;hall be they of his own hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>SOME frame an Objection again&s;t this Practice from the <HI>Decrees of GOD.</HI> They &s;ay that <HI>GOD has predetermin'd and fixed the Period of every ones life, beyond which nothing &s;hall protrect it; &s;o that if this time be come Inoculation will not &s;ave the Per&s;ons life.</HI> But this <HI>Argument</HI> may as well be urg'd again&s;t the U&s;e of <HI>all Phy&s;ick,</HI> nay even of <HI>Food,</HI> as again&s;t this Practice. I truly believe, as my Bible teaches me, that GOD has fix'd the Period of every ones life; but I al&s;o believe that He has done it with <HI>a Regard to Second Cau&s;es,</HI> or that Cour&s;e of Na|ture which He has e&s;tabli&s;h'd; <HI>the End and
<PB N="10" REF="002247_0011_0FDAD9959AC52258">
Means are determin'd together.</HI> He that has fix'd in His own Coun&s;el how long we &s;hall live, has al&s;o determin'd that by &s;uch and &s;uch means our lives &s;hall be continu'd to that Period of time. And how does any one know, but this is to be the <HI>appointed Means,</HI> of their Pre&s;ervation in life?</P>
<P>SOME have ask'd <HI>Whether we could a&s;&s;ure them their lives in this Way?</HI> It is &s;trange that any &s;hould put the Que&s;tion! When there is none can give the A&s;&s;urance of this <HI>not in the mo&s;t innocent and common Means</HI> that are every day made u&s;e of: Why then &s;hou'd they demand it in <HI>this?</HI> I know of one who died under a Vomit. Another, whom I al&s;o knew, died by pulling out a Tooth; the bleeding at the Gums after the Extraction of the Tooth could not be &s;topt, and in a few hours he died. And for my own part, as much as I am now for Inoculation, I am not at all &s;hy to &s;ay, that a Per&s;on may mi&s;carry under it: For <HI>GOD is Sovereign,</HI> and will keep us in a dependance upon Him in the u&s;e of all Means. But if it be &s;afe under the <HI>common Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of GOD, that is &s;ufficient to warrant me to venture upon it, when there is Occa|&s;ion. Nay, if one in an hundred &s;hould die in this way, while there is <HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> (as there <HI>then</HI> would be) that it is <HI>ten times</HI> as &s;afe as the common way of infection. This, I humbly conceive, would be &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify my going into it: Tho' I mu&s;t confe&s;s, in this particular, I was once of another mind.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="002247_0012_0FDAD99740E6D9A8">
BUT <HI>&s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould die in the way of Ino|culation, would it not make a dying hour very dark to me, to think that I us'd means to bring it upon my &s;elf?</HI> This is a Que&s;tion I mu&s;t confe&s;s, has been the mo&s;t <HI>affecting</HI> to me, of any that have related to this matter. But after the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration I have be&s;tow'd upon it, I thus think; "If a Per&s;on &s;hould die under Inoculation, he dies in the U&s;e of the mo&s;t <HI>likely</HI> means, he knew of&punc; to &s;ave his life in a time of common peril; he dies <HI>then</HI> in the <HI>Way of Duty,</HI> and <HI>&s;o</HI> in <HI>GOD's Way:</HI> If the Ble&s;&s;ing is deny'd, he mu&s;t hum|bly re&s;ign this his frail <HI>life</HI> unto the <HI>GOD of it, Looking for the Mercy of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto Eternal Life.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is one thing more &s;aid again&s;t this Practice, which I am loth to take Notice of, becau&s;e of the&mdash;of it; but it being &s;o fre|quently in the Mouths of People, I cannot but name it. 'Tis this, <HI>that it is originally from the Devil.</HI> Sure this is the effect of <HI>Tran&s;port,</HI> &amp;c. I will return a better an&s;wer to it than it de|&s;erves. If it be a <HI>Method of Safety,</HI> and a <HI>Benefit to Mankind,</HI> as hitherto it appears to be, how came the Devil to be the Author of it? Was he ever a <HI>Benefactor</HI> to Mankind? No: But he is a <HI>Murderer from the beginning.</HI> Every Age of the World produces &s;ome <HI>new</HI> and u&s;eful Di&s;coveries in one Profe&s;&s;ion, Art and Science o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> another: And, if this Di&s;co|very

be re&s;erv'd for our Day, why &s;hould it not be accepted <HI>in all places with all Thankful|ne&s;s&punc;</HI> In a word, I cannot but think, it's Ori|ginal deriv'd el&s;ewhere, becau&s;e my <HI>Bible</HI> teaches me that <HI>every good &amp; perfect Gift comes down from the Father of Lights.</HI></P>
<P>AS to that Objection of the danger of others catching the Di&s;temper of the Inoculated, there needs only this to be &s;aid; That as 'tis to be &s;uppos'd, the Practi&s;e will not be gone into till the danger of Infection becomes com|mon in a place, &s;o there may be Methods ea&s;ily taken to prevent its hazarding others that can't yet come into it. And I think there ought to be a prudent Care in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>THUS, <HI>my Friend,</HI> I have freely given you my Tho'ts about this Practice &s;o <HI>much &s;poken; again&s;t.</HI> I mu&s;t now leave you to judge for your &s;elf; praying GOD to <HI>&s;hew</HI> you <HI>his Way.</HI> If you come into the Practice, I know you will not do it in <HI>carnal Security;</HI> for that may provoke GOD to deny the Ble&s;&s;ing. And, if GOD plea&s;e to give it the de&s;ir'd Succe&s;s, you'l religiou&s;ly give Glory to Him, not only for delivering you from <HI>Death,</HI> but for &s;aving you from &s;uch a <HI>bed of Corruption,</HI> as others have many <HI>weari&s;ome days and nights appointed</HI> them in; you'l think your &s;elf the <HI>more ob|lig'd</HI> to thank and prai&s;e your <HI>kind Phy&s;ician,</HI> (I mean the <HI>Great One</HI>) who has wro't your Cure by &s;o <HI>gentle</HI> a Method.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002247_0014_0FDAD99D32CB6330">
I have no more to add but my Prayers, that you and I may be made meet for, and, in GOD's time, bro't &s;afe to, that World where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hall be <HI>no more Sickne&s;s, nor any more Death;</HI> where Sin, and all the penal Con&s;e|quences of it, &s;hall be done away for ever.</P>
