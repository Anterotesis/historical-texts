<HEAD>INNOCENT BLOOD CRYING TO GOD FROM THE GROUND.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>GENESIS III. 10.</BIBL>
<Q>&mdash;<HI>The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I NEED not inform you, my hearers, that the bloody and mo&s;t cruel action of la&s;t Monday evening led me to the choice of the words which have now been read, for the theme of the following di&s;|cour&s;e. We &s;hould be criminal to let &s;uch an awful affair pa&s;s over without taking notice of it in a religious manner.</P>
<P>THE unparallelled barbarity of tho&s;e who were lately guilty of murdering a number of our innocent fellow-citizens will never be forgot.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="012094_0005_0F89C433B7F23C30">
THE now li&s;ping child will rehear&s;e the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to his attentive offspring, when revolving years have covered his head with &s;ilver locks. Future generations will read the account with &s;orrow, indignation and &s;urprize: &s;orrow for the dead, who &s;ell vic|tims to the mercile&s;s rage of wicked men: indignation again&s;t the wor&s;t of murderers; and &s;urprize that any rational beings could be so de&s;titute of every human feeling, as wantonly to de&s;troy tho&s;e who never did, or thought of doing them any hurt.</P>
<P>BUT we have &s;een the gloomy time when our brethren were murdered before our eyes, and our mo&s;t public &s;treets were deeply dyed with innocent blood. How affecting, unut|terably affecting, to &s;ee our fellow citizens &s;hot to death&mdash;<HI>their garments rolled in blood,</HI> and corp&s;es wallowing in gore, upon our Exchange, the place of general concour&s;e, where our mo&s;t re&s;pectable inhabitants meet every day! But &s;uch a &s;cene has been acted&mdash;yea the blood of the &s;lain is but now wa&s;hed from the pavements.</P>
<P>A NOBLE &s;pirit, indeed has appeared on this occa&s;ion, not only in &s;ecuring the pre|&s;umed murderers that they may be brought to trial; but in&s;i&s;ting that <HI>all</HI> the troops &s;hould be removed from among us.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="012094_0006_0F89C434C15C30B8">
FROM this violent out-breaking, and innu|merable di&s;orders that might be mentioned, the whole world may be convinced of the infinite impropriety of quartering troops in a well-regulated city under a notion of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing the civil magi&s;trate, or &s;trengthening go|vernment. I pray God we may never be|hold a like appearance on a like pretence! It is time for that magi&s;trate to re&s;ign, who cannot depend on the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his <HI>neigh|bours</HI> and <HI>fellow-citizens</HI> in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. And that <HI>government</HI> which re|jecting the foundation of the <HI>law,</HI> would e&s;tabli&s;h it&s;elf by the <HI>&s;word,</HI> the &s;ooner it falls to the ground the better, that in its &s;tead another might be e&s;tabli&s;hed, more a|greeable to the nature of man, and con&s;i&s;tent with the great ends of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>BUT we &s;hall leave the&s;e con&s;iderations to the improvement of the politicians of the day, and pur&s;ue the thoughts which the words read &s;eem naturally to &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>WHAT I de&s;ign, is to &s;hew particularly when it may be &s;aid, that innocent blood crieth unto God in the &s;en&s;e of our text, and then make &s;ome reflections &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="012094_0007_0F89C436B5785EA8">
FIRST then, Human blood crieth unto God, when it is &s;hed in a wanton or cruel manner, without warrant from the <HI>law of the land or law of nations,</HI> founded upon and con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>law of nature written upon the heart</HI> by God him&s;elf, to &s;peak in the language of in&s;piration.</P>
<P>BEFORE there was any &s;uch thing as civil government, which is founded on compact or the agreement of a number of people up|on &s;ome plan to &s;ecure their general happi|ne&s;s, every individual had a perfect right to his own per&s;on, life, and limbs, and a clear &s;en&s;e of his duty and intere&s;t in pre&s;erving and defending them again&s;t the attacks of any one. The&s;e natural notions were planted in our brea&s;ts by the God who made us, and would for ever lead us to determine that the life of man is &s;acred, and his blood not to be &s;hed, unle&s;s forfeited by &s;ome atrocious crime. In the yet uncultivated wilds of America, &s;o &s;trong are the&s;e moral notices, that the man who is con&s;cious of having murdered another, does not pretend to re&s;i&s;t the &s;urviving relation, who takes upon him|&s;elf the office of an avenger of blood, but calmly bows his head to receive the fatal blow. Hence well ob&s;erves St. Paul, <HI>that the heathen, which have not the</HI> (written) <HI>law, are a law unto them&s;elves:</HI> their under&s;tand|ings
<PB N="9" REF="012094_0008_0F89C436D5E1A388">
and con&s;ciences witne&s;&s;ing the ju&s;tice of the divine decree, that, <HI>he who &s;heddeth man's blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed.</HI> To refu&s;e, or unrea&s;onably delay doing ju&s;|tice upon the murderer, is to let the blood of the innocent, like that of Abel, cry unto God for vengeance.</P>
<P>THE murderer forfeits his right to life even in a &s;tate of nature, where there is no civil authority; in that ca&s;e every man is in &s;ome &s;en&s;e a mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice, and may ex|ecute the law which God has written upon his heart. And whether that univer&s;al prac|tice which obtains among the &s;avages, of the neare&s;t kin&s;man pur&s;uing &amp; &s;laying the mur|derer of his relation, is not &s;trictly ju&s;tifiable upon principles of <HI>natural law,</HI> will I think &s;carce admit of a que&s;tion.</P>
<P>THUS much is plain, we have no &s;ecurity for life in the neighbourhood of a per&s;on having a di&s;po&s;ition &amp; power to de&s;troy us: <HI>&s;elf-pre&s;ervation</HI> therefore obliges us, on fai|lure of other expedience, to cut off &s;uch a common and dangerous enemy. And it &s;eems as if all who found him, whether re|lated to the &s;lain or not, might fall upon and di&s;patch him.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="012094_0009_0F89C437756B9D08">
How &s;trong a &s;en&s;e of this appears in the &s;ad expo&s;tulation of guilty, &s;elf-condemned Cain?&mdash;<HI>Every one that findeth me &s;hall &s;lay me.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the ca&s;e of Abel, who was murder|ed before the promulgation of any law in that behalf, it is &s;ufficiently evident that the blood which was unju&s;tly &s;hed called aloud to God for vengeance, whether it was his will that the &s;hedder &s;hould be de&s;troyed by a relation of the &s;lain, or by whoever met with him; or whether, acting as Supreme Judge, he re&s;erved the execution to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>WE add &s;econdly, The blood which is &s;hed contrary to the revealed law of God calls to him from the Ground.</P>
<P>GOD &s;hewed his ab&s;olute abhorrence of murder from the beginning: he denounced a tremendous cur&s;e again&s;t him who was fir&s;t guilty of it. From the nature of the crime, and the fear which Cain expre&s;&s;ed, it is more than probable that murder was puni&s;hed by death in the mo&s;t early ages, though we find no expre&s;s law requiring it till after the flood, when the &s;olemn declaration, in part cited before, was made. <HI>And &s;urely your blood of your lives will I require: at the hand of every bea&s;t will I require it; and at the hand
<PB N="11" REF="012094_0010_0F89C43874E3DF08">
of a man, at the hand of every man's brother, will I require the life of man. Who&s;o &s;hed|deth man's blood by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed, for in the image of God made he man.</HI> In the&s;e words the value of human life is fixed; a guard is &s;et upon it by God him&s;elf, and that penalty is fully expre&s;&s;ed which the Author of Life is plea&s;ed &s;hould be incurred by him who unju&s;tly dares to take it away.</P>
<P>THE life of man is highly valued&mdash;<HI>for in the Image of God made he man.</HI> This value was &s;et upon the life of man, even when he was a &s;inner; for notwith&s;tanding the depravity of human nature, none of God's works in this part of the &s;y&s;tem are worthy to be compared with the children of men. They are capable of higher &s;ervices and more refined enjoyments than the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h.</P>
<P>THEY are therefore protected with more care. Even the irrational creature, who is capable of neither moral good nor evil, mu&s;t be killed, if by a wild ungovernable rage he &s;hould de&s;troy a man. No le&s;s excu&s;able is the rage of man if he really intended to kill, unle&s;s in defence of his own life under ab&s;o|lute nece&s;&s;ity, <HI>he &s;hall &s;urely be put to death,</HI> according to the immutable &s;entence of the great Jehovah!</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="012094_0011_0F89C4394B98F2C8">
THE <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of innocent blood cannot be al|layed, but by the death of the guilty! There is no evading this law where the murder is indublicably proved&mdash;no liberty to acquit the criminal&mdash;God, the &s;upreme legi&s;lator, has given the magi&s;trate no authority to alter or di&s;pon&s;e with his law, or mitigate the puni&s;h|ment in any manner or degree. <HI>He &s;hall &s;urely be put to death!</HI> And if that puni&s;h|ment is not inflicted, innocent blood will cry from the ground&mdash;it will cry for ven|geance to fall not only on the murderer wherever he is, but upon tho&s;e, whoever they are, that divert the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, and cau&s;e the murderers to go unpuni&s;hed.</P>
<P>THESE capital puni&s;hments are doubtle&s;s very di&s;agreeable <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;to put an end to the life of one's <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> fellow-men is &s;hocking.</P>
<P>THE tender &s;eeings of human nature &s;trongly, &s;trongly plead in behalf of the cri|minal, and be&s;eech the judges if po&s;&s;ible to &s;hew mercy. But &s;hould any degree of ten|derne&s;s&mdash;&s;hould the &s;tronge&s;t inclination to mercy&mdash;or &s;hould all the horrors of an ex|ecution influence a conduct &s;o contrary to the <HI>law of God?</HI> When the Lord of heaven has declared he &s;hall &s;urely die, and more|over added, <HI>thou &s;halt not pity him, but thou &s;halt put away the guilt of innocent blood.</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="012094_0012_0F89C43A15D4D248">
&s;hall any pretend to pity&mdash;&s;hall any, at the expence of incurring the vengeance due to blood-guiltine&s;s, dare to acquit, to &s;pare, or &s;olicit a pardon!</P>
<P>THIRDLY, Human blood crieth from the ground, when it is &s;hed contrary to the laws of the community within which it is &s;pilled.</P>
<P>CIVIL government, if good, is founded upon the law of nature, or the revealed law of God&mdash;the divine plea&s;ure is an univer&s;al law, <HI>eternally</HI> binding upon all rational crea|tures; whether this plea&s;ure be known by certain notions of right and wrong, which all men have within them&mdash;by the declarati|ons of holy men who have been favoured with intimate acquaintance with God&mdash;or by immediate revelations from the Deity him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THAT he who formed the univer&s;e &s;hould be lord and king, is a conclu&s;ion few, if any, will deny. This only ab&s;olute Monarch has an indi&s;putable right to make &s;uch laws, and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch rules of government, as he knows will be&s;t &s;uit the nature and mutual relations of all his &s;ubjects, and &s;erve be&s;t to promote and &s;ecure the general happine&s;s of all.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="012094_0013_0F89C43A8763CCC8">
THAT it is the will of God his creatures &s;hould be happy, is very evident from his own mo&s;t &s;olemn declarations. It is al&s;o in a good degree evident from the unextin|gui&s;hable thir&s;t, after it, placed by God in eve|ry &s;en&s;itive being. All wi&s;h for it; and however diver&s;e our notions of happine&s;s may be, <HI>'the eternal &s;igh'</HI> covets it with mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire and &s;teady attention.</P>
<P>IT is utterly unworthy, and incon&s;i&s;tent with every idea of infinite wi&s;dom and pow|er, of inexhau&s;tible fullne&s;s and unbounded beneficence, to &s;uppo&s;e the Creator of man de|&s;igned him only a compo&s;ition of appetites, wants, and de&s;ires, for the rea&s;onable grati|fication of which he has made no provi&s;ion. Infinitely more &s;hocking would be the pre&s;um|tion, that he had left him open to all inva|&s;ions from bea&s;ts of prey, and men more &s;a|vage than the bea&s;t, and neglected to furni&s;h him with means of defence or e&s;cape.</P>
<P>ONE of the &s;tronge&s;t affections or inclina|tions of the human mind is that for &s;ociety.&mdash;<HI>The Lord God &s;aid, It is not good that Man &s;hould be alone.</HI> The whole &s;pecies, indeed every order of creatures, &s;eem de&s;ign|ed as meet-helpers to each other. All the difficulty in civil and &s;ocial life is, righteou&s;ly to determine how much help we have a right
<PB N="15" REF="012094_0014_0F89C43B433C9D00">
to expect or demand of each other and what &s;hall be a ju&s;t con&s;ideration for &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. The Author and Fini&s;her of our faith has graciou&s;ly &s;olved this grand que&s;tion, in a divine axiom, as copious and de&s;criptive, as plain and &s;uitable to the human under&s;tand|ing. <HI>All things what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them; for this is</HI> THE LAW&mdash;the eternal and im|mutable rea&s;on of things con&s;tituted to pro|mote and &s;ecure the happine&s;s of all.</P>
<P>GOVERNMENT, in whatever form it may be e&s;tabli&s;hed, can <HI>rightly</HI> aim at no o|ther, and <HI>po&s;&s;ibly</HI> at no higher end. Even the government of the Supreme Ruler of the univer&s;e is not pretended to aim at any thing more or greater!&mdash;</P>
<P>THE general good is therefore the end of all ju&s;t government; and all the rules of conduct, agreed upon, all the &s;tatutes, laws, and precepts, enacted and promulged, are made with a view to promote and &s;ecure the public good: and therefore the very nature and de&s;ign of government require <HI>new</HI> laws to be <HI>made</HI> whenever it is found that the old ones are not &s;ufficient; and <HI>old ones</HI> to be repealed, whenever they are found to be mi&s;|chievous in their operation. Yea, if the e&s;|&s;ential parts of any &s;y&s;tem of civil govern|ment
<PB N="16" REF="012094_0015_0F89C43BF4023198">
are found to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the general good, the end of government re|quires that &s;uch bad &s;y&s;tem &s;hould be demo|li&s;hed, and a new one formed, by which the public weal &s;hall be more effectually &s;ecured.&mdash;And further, if under any con&s;titution of government the admini&s;tration &s;hould vary from the fundamental de&s;igns of promoting and &s;ecuring the common good; in &s;uch ca&s;e the &s;ubjects are in duty bound to join all their &s;trength to reduce matters to their ori|ginal <HI>good order,</HI> whatever may be the fate of tho&s;e <HI>wicked men</HI> who for ends of their own would &s;ubvert the RIGHTS of the people.&mdash;</P>
<P>As no right is more &s;acred than that of every innocent man to enjoy his own life, and the law of nature authorizes every indi|vidual to defend his life, that &s;y&s;tem which was given by God to his people contains a number of very particular laws to &s;ecure the lives of the innocent, and mo&s;t po&s;itive in|junctions for the extirpation of &s;uch as are guilty of innocent blood, as has been men|tioned in the former part of this di&s;cour&s;e. In no point are the laws of our excellent con|&s;titution more expre&s;s; for what peace can be more <HI>&s;acred</HI> than <HI>the peace of God and the king,</HI> which every quiet &s;ubject has a right to; which nothing can de&s;troy?</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="012094_0016_0F89C43D99D61ED8">
FROM all the foregoing con&s;iderations it is plain, if any one by de&s;ign &s;lay another, or any-way cau&s;e an innocent per&s;on to be put to death, that innocent blood crieth un|to God from the ground: it crieth for ven|geance. It crieth to all who &s;ee it, or hear of its being &s;hed. It crieth to the murderer him&s;elf, and requires him to &s;ubmit to ju&s;tice, and receive his puni&s;hment. It crieth to tho&s;e that are witne&s;&s;es, and requires them to give faithful te&s;timony of what they know. Whoever knows of murder and does not give information thereof, that the guilty may be brought to ju&s;tice, will have innocent blood crying for vengeance to fall upon him. In|nocent blood crieth to the magi&s;trate, that the murderer be &s;ecured and brought to trial; it crieth to the judges, and requires that they &s;ee it avenged. And if innocent blood is not heard and avenged according to the &s;trict requirements of the law of God and the laws of every good &s;y&s;tem of civil govern|ment, it will continue to cry, not only again&s;t <HI>the murderer,</HI> but the <HI>government</HI> and <HI>land,</HI> which &s;uffers murderers to go unpuni&s;hed.</P>
<P>THUS have I mentioned, as particularly as &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary, when it may be &s;aid that human blood crieth unto God in the &s;en&s;e of the text.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="012094_0017_0F89C43E382BB320">
AND what a &s;olemn cry of innocent blood is now going up to heaven from our &s;treets! The &s;cene lately acted among us is on many accounts the mo&s;t-afflicting that ever this place beheld! When con&s;uming fires have repeatedly &s;wept down a great number of our hou&s;es, the inhabitants e&s;caping the flames viewed the lo&s;s of their &s;ub&s;tance as chargea|ble to the malevolence of no one: but in the late dreadful affair we &s;aw the agents, and had nothing but de&s;truction to expect from their unbounded and unbridled rage, had they happened to have force enough to have put their horrid de&s;igns in execution.</P>
<P>THE barbarous murder of young <HI>Snider</HI> on the 22d of la&s;t Month was di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to all who had any feelings of humanity; but how aggravated was the horrid affair of la&s;t <HI>Monday</HI> night!</P>
<P>IT is pretty evident from &s;everal plain te&s;|timonies, and a variety of circum&s;tances, that a number of the troops, with other &s;ons of <HI>Belial,</HI> were determined to murder the in|habitants&mdash;They began in &s;everal parts of the town&mdash;The alarmed people rang the bells to collect an aid for their &s;ecurity; and when they had obliged the fir&s;t riotous &s;ol|diers to retire, and were di&s;per&s;ing, not ex|pecting any further di&s;turbance, a party of

<P>WERE our brethren killed by avowed enemies in time of open war, we &s;hould be grieved, it is true, but we could not complain; death and &s;laughter may then be expected: but in a time of profound peace, to have troops quartered among us on pretence of &s;upporting government, where government has ever been &s;upported as well as in any part of the known world&mdash;to be abu&s;ed by common &s;oldiers&mdash;to be a&s;&s;aulted by them in &s;ome or other part of the town al|mo&s;t every evening&mdash;to be wounded with the in&s;truments of death&mdash;yea, finally, to &s;ee our brethren killed in cold blood&mdash;to behold their mortal ga&s;ps, and hear their dy|ing groans&mdash;but I de&s;i&s;t&mdash;the rehear&s;al of the&s;e things is too much for me. Who can reflect on the horrors of that night with|out &s;huddering! What were our fears, when the inhabitants, rou&s;ed by the murder of their brethren, were hurrying together&mdash;When the troops were all paraded, and with fire arms pre&s;ented &s;tood ready to attack or defend, from the ju&s;t indignation of an en|raged multitude, and nothing le&s;s than a ge|neral &s;laughter could be expected! To God alone be prai&s;e, that in this critical moment

his divine power was di&s;played, and the re|mainder of wrath in &s;o &s;ignal a manner re|&s;trained!</P>
<P>No le&s;s con&s;picuous was the good hand of God in moving the hearts of tho&s;e in power to exert them&s;elves for the immediate relief of the people from further fears and dan|gers, to which a longer continuance of the troops in town would have &s;ubjected them. The wi&s;e&s;t of men has well ob&s;erved, and too &s;ien&s;ibly have we found it verified, that per|&s;ons cannot well dwell together unle&s;s they are agreed. The human heart mu&s;t undergo a &s;trange revolution before it can look kindly on the in&s;truments of its ruin and de&s;truction! We tru&s;t in God's unerring Providence, that &s;o unnatural a &s;ociety will never be the &s;ub|ject of another experiment&mdash;That the civil magi&s;trate will never again be furni&s;hed with &s;uch a band of a&s;&s;i&s;tants, as will re&s;cue criminals cut of his hands, and even put his life in danger in the execution of his office.&mdash;That the lower and loo&s;er part of our youth may never again have &s;uch additional temptations to for&s;ake the paths of virtue and religion.</P>
<P>FINALLY, that we may be allowed to live in the full enjoyment of all tho&s;e im|portant <HI>rights</HI> and <HI>privileges,</HI> both of a civil

and religious nature, with which the God of our fathers has been plea&s;ed to favour this part of his heritage; let us take heed to our ways, let us by a pious and exemplary behaviour per&s;uade men that Liberty and Religion are worth contending for&mdash;Let us chearfully con&s;pire with our Lord and Ma&s;ter to do good unto all, <HI>even to the evil and unthankful.</HI> Let ju&s;tice flow down our &s;treets as a river, and righteou&s;ne&s;s as an overflowing &s;tream&mdash;Let the &s;abbaths of the Lord, which have been too long profan|ed by the noi&s;e of drums and other martial in&s;truments, be now &s;anctified by the reve|rent and peaceful exerci&s;es of religion. Let the late affecting &s;pectacles of mortality&mdash;the awful pomp of &s;o uncommon a funeral, excite us all to preparation for our own di&s;|&s;olution. Though we hope not to be mur|dered and cut off by the hand of violence, we are yet mortal. We mu&s;t all die, it may be &s;uddenly. Let us then &s;eriou&s;ly engage and unweariedly per&s;evere in the &s;ervice of the Lord, that whenever we are called from this very precarious &s;tate, we may be found doing tho will of our great God and Redeemer, and at la&s;t be admitted into eternal glory.</P>
