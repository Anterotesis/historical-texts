<P>BEing <HI>Chri&s;tmas-Eve,</HI> and hav|ing preached <HI>twice,</HI> I went in the Even|ing to <HI>Crooked-Lane</HI> Society, where God enabled me to with&s;tand &s;e|veral Per&s;ons, who cavil'd again&s;t the Doctrine of the <HI>New Birth.</HI> I then went and expounded to a Company at Mr.

<HI>B&mdash;'s,</HI> in <HI>Little-Britain,</HI> and then went to another <HI>Love Fea&s;t</HI> in <HI>Fetter-Lane,</HI> and continued till near <HI>four</HI> in the Morning in <HI>Prayer, P&s;alms, &amp; Thank&s;giving,</HI> with many truly Chri&s;tian <HI>Brethren;</HI> and my Heart was much enlarged &amp; full of Love. God gave me a great Spirit of Suppli|cation; <HI>Adored be his free Grace in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> Amen &amp; Amen.</P>
<P>MONDAY <HI>Decem.</HI> 25. About <HI>four</HI> I went and prayed and expounded to another Society in <HI>Red-Cro&s;s-Street,</HI> con|&s;i&s;ting of near two or three hundred People, the Room was exceeding hot. I had been <HI>watching unto Prayer</HI> all Night, yet God vouch&s;afed &s;o to fill me with his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, that I &s;pake with as great Power, as I ever did in my Life. My Body was weak, but I found a &s;upernatural Strength, and the Truth of that Saying, <HI>When I am weak, then am I &s;trong.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Six</HI> I went to <HI>Crutched-Friars</HI> Society, and expounded as well as I could, but perceived my &s;elf a little op|pre&s;&s;ed with Drow&s;ine&s;s. <HI>How does the corruptible Body weigh down the Soul! When &s;hall I be deliver'd from the Burden of this Fle&s;h!</HI></P>

Preached (never the le&s;s) <HI>thrice,</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in admini&s;tring the <HI>Sacrament</HI> the &s;ame Day, without going to <HI>Sleep.</HI> God will make his Power to be known in me.&mdash;This Day 24 Years I was <HI>baptized.</HI> Lord, to what little Purpo&s;e have I lived! However, I &s;eal'd my <HI>Bapti&s;mal Covenant</HI> with my dear <HI>Savi|our's</HI> mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Body and Blood; and tru&s;t in his Strength I &s;hall keep &amp; per|form it. Amen, Amen.</P>
<P>SATURDAY <HI>Decem.</HI> 30. Preached <HI>nine</HI> times this Week, and expounded near <HI>eighteen</HI> times, with great Power &amp; En|largement.&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed be God, I am every Moment imploy'd, from Morning till Midnight.&mdash;There's no End of People's coming and &s;ending to me, and they &s;eem more and more de&s;irous, like <HI>new|born Babes,</HI> to be <HI>fed with the &s;incere Milk of the Word.</HI></P>
<P>What a great Work has been wrought in the Hearts of many within this <HI>Twelve-Month!</HI> Now know I, that tho' <HI>Thou|&s;ands</HI> might come at fir&s;t out of <HI>Curio&s;ity,</HI> yet God has prevented &amp; quickned them by his free Grace. <HI>O that I could be humble and thankful!</HI></P>

<HI>Glory be to God, that he fills me conti|nually, not only with Peace, but al&s;o Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t!</HI>&mdash;Before my Arri|val, I thought I &s;hould <HI>envy</HI> my <HI>Brethrens Succe&s;s</HI> in the Mini&s;try, but ble&s;&s;ed be God I rejoyce in it, and am glad to &s;ee Chri&s;t's Kingdom come, what&s;oever <HI>In|&s;truments</HI> God &s;hall make u&s;e of to bring it about.&mdash;Sometimes I perceive my &s;elf <HI>de&s;erted</HI> for a little while, and much op|pre&s;s'd, e&s;pecially before preaching, but <HI>Comfort</HI> &s;oon after flows in.&mdash;<HI>The King|dom of God is within me!

<P>SUNDAY, <HI>Decem.</HI> 31. Preached <HI>twice</HI> to large Congregations, e&s;pecially in the Afternoon at <HI>Spittlefields.</HI> I had great <HI>Hoar&s;ne&s;s</HI> upon me, and was <HI>de&s;erted</HI> be|fore I went into the Pulpit; but God <HI>&s;trengthned</HI> me to &s;peak, &s;o as to be heard by all.</P>
<P>I de&s;pair'd of <HI>&s;peaking</HI> much more that Night, my <HI>Cold</HI> being very great; but God enabled me to <HI>expound</HI> to <HI>two</HI> Companies in <HI>Southwark;</HI> and I was <HI>never</HI> more enlarged in Prayer in my whole Life.</P>

Tho&s;e <HI>Words</HI> were much pre&s;&s;ed upon my Soul, <HI>"And the Power of the Lord was pre&s;ent to heal them",</HI> and indeed I believe it was; for many were <HI>pricked to the Heart</HI> and <HI>felt</HI> them&s;elves to be Sinners. <HI>O that all the World knew and felt that!</HI></P>
<P>MONDAY, <HI>Jan.</HI> 1.

<P>TUESDAY, <HI>Jan.</HI> 2. Staid at <HI>Home</HI> to receive tho&s;e who wanted to con&s;ult me.&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed be God, from <HI>&s;even</HI> in the Morning, till <HI>three</HI> in the Afternoon, Peo|ple came; &s;ome telling me what God <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word">

His Mercies melt me down, <HI>O that I were thankful!</HI></P>
<P>THURSDAY, <HI>Jan.</HI> 4. My <HI>Cold</HI> conti|nued, and I fear'd it would <HI>prevent</HI> my Speaking, yet God enabled me to <HI>expound</HI> with extraordinary Power in a <HI>private Society;</HI> and then to <HI>preach</HI> at <HI>Wapping Chapel,</HI> &s;o that the Word <HI>pierc'd</HI> the Hearers Souls! And afterward I ex|pounded &amp; prayed for an Hour and half, with great Power and <HI>Demon&s;tration of the Spirit,</HI> and my Heart was full of God.</P>
<P><HI>How immediately does Je&s;us Chri&s;t re|ward me for my poor Services! as &s;oon as my daily Work is done, he &s;ays, "Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord." He com|mands, &amp; it is done.</HI></P>

whom God brought together from the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t, North</HI> and <HI>South.</HI></P>
<P>What we were in <HI>Doubt</HI> about, after Prayer, we determined by <HI>Lot;</HI> and e|very Thing was carried on with great Love, Meekne&s;s &amp; Devotion.&mdash;We continued in <HI>Fa&s;ting &amp; Prayer</HI> till <HI>three</HI> o' Clock, and then parted with a full Conviction that God was going to do great Things among us. <HI>Oh that we may be any ways In&s;trumental to his Glory! that he would make us Ve&s;&s;els pure and holy, meet for our Ma&s;ter's U&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Expounded twice</HI> afterwards in <HI>London</HI> with great Power, and then was much enlarged for near an Hour in <HI>Prayer,</HI> in <HI>Fetter-Lane</HI> Society.&mdash;The <HI>Spirit of Sup|plication</HI> increa&s;es in my Heart daily! May it increa&s;e ever, more and more.</P>
<P>I did not find the <HI>Pity</HI> I ought, upon &s;eeing a <HI>Brother</HI> full of <HI>Self-love.</HI> LORD, <HI>inlarge my narrow Heart, and give me that Charity, which rejoyces not in Iniquity, but rejoyces in the Truth.</HI>&mdash;I perceived &s;ome|thing a little bordering on <HI>Envy</HI> toward my Brother H.&mdash;I find more &amp; more that true <HI>Humility</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in being <HI>&s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive</HI> to tho&s;e who are a <HI>little above</HI> or a little <HI>below</HI> us. <HI>"Oh when &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span">
