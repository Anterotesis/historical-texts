<P>Wherever medical records have been faithfully kept by phy&s;icians, fevers have been &s;crupulou&s;ly noticed and inve&s;tigated. The nece&s;&s;ity of this we will not wonder at, when we come to con&s;ider the great pro|portion of di&s;ea&s;es, which are either originally fevers, or become &s;o from &s;ome &s;ymptomatic affection:&mdash;But fevers of the putrid kind have particularly drawn their attention, both on account of their fa|tality, and univer&s;al prevalence when they have taken place, as well as the difficulty in the method of cure: The uniformity of the pathognomonic &s;ymptoms in putrid fevers, from the days of Hippocrates to the pre&s;ent time, is &s;o great, that it renders almo&s;t all the hi&s;tories of this di&s;ea&s;e like mere copies from one author to another. However, when it rages epide|mically, it may yet have &s;ome accidental &s;ymptoms, which have frequently led phy&s;icians to &s;uppo&s;e it a different di&s;ea&s;e, and con&s;equently to give it a diffe|rent name. It was this that led the great Sydenham, and the illu&s;trious Boerhaave, tho&s;e luminaries of the profe&s;&s;ion of medicine, to believe that fevers were unlimited in their number; which, according to the ob&s;ervations of Sir John Pringle, Doctor Hux|ham, the late Profe&s;&s;or Doctor Cullen,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cullen's Fir&s;t Lines, par. lxvii.</NOTE> and others, is now proved to be exceedingly limited. Thus we &s;hall find, in the hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e under con&s;i|deration, &s;ome accidental &s;ymptoms ob&s;erved, which made phy&s;icians differ very much in the method of cure, as well as in their opinion of the nature of the fever.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="024024_0006_0FC2DDE1E2568700">
It is not, however, my de&s;ign to enter into a ge|neral de&s;cription of fevers, and their differences; but merely to take notice of the epidemic which lately raged &s;o univer&s;ally in this city and its &s;uburbs.</P>
<P>About the middle of Augu&s;t, 1791, a contagious fever appeared in the city of New-York, which fir&s;t di&s;covered it&s;elf near Peck's-&s;lip, a part of the city thickly inhabited, its hou&s;es generally &s;mall, and badly ventulated&punc; many of the inhabitants were in indigent circum&s;tances, which is a frequent cau&s;e of the want of cleanline&s;s. Here it raged a con&s;iderable time; it then began to &s;pread, as &s;ome attendants on the &s;ick became affected, who lived in other neigh|bourhoods. By this mean it was carried to diffe|rent families, and mo&s;t generally could be traced from this &s;ource. It likewi&s;e proved more particu|larly fatal near the place where it fir&s;t appeared, than in any other part. Thus at length it &s;pread through the city, until about the middle of October, when the weather growing a little cooler, the di&s;ea&s;e greatly abated, and in a &s;hort time nearly di&s;appeared. I have been informed by &s;everal phy&s;icians of reputa|tion, who re&s;ide and practice in the country, that many of the boatmen, who frequented the city from Long-I&s;land and the upper part of Hud&s;on's river, carried the di&s;ea&s;e home, where it proved fatal to &s;everal.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor William Moore, an eminent phy&s;ician of New-York, informed me, that a gentleman from Lime, in the &s;tate of Con|necticut, was on a vi&s;it to this city, when he became a patient of his, in whom the di&s;ea&s;e was very evidently marked, attended with large vibices; he however recruited con&s;iderably before he left the city: on his pa&s;&s;age to Lime he relap&s;ed, and died &s;hortly after he reached home. The greater part of his family caught the contagion, and &s;oon became affected with a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e; which proved fatal to his mother, and &s;ome other per&s;ons in the family.</NOTE></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, in the &s;outh-we&s;tern part of the city, an intermittent and remittent fever prevailed,
<PB N="8" REF="024024_0007_0FC2DDEF86F518F0">
together with a few ca&s;es of dy&s;entery. This cau&s;ed much di&s;pute among phy&s;icians, as they generally named the di&s;ea&s;e from the ca&s;es which they had an opportunity of &s;eeing mo&s;t prevalent. Some called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a remittent, others, bilious; &s;ome typhus, putrid, or malignant; and others, following Sydenham, febris bilio&s;a remittens.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of a few ca&s;es terminating &s;uddenly fatal, together with the very unju&s;t, as well as un|generous judgment of &s;ome phy&s;icians, in determin|ing every di&s;ea&s;e to be the putrid fever, fear &s;pread from mind to mind like a devouring famine, and terror, frequently more hideous than the di&s;ea&s;e it|&s;elf, wrought on the minds of the credulous and weak. This, in &s;ome ca&s;es, greatly increa&s;ed the malignity of the fever: in others again, even a &s;light head-ach cau&s;ed them to de&s;pond, and threw them into a &s;tate of langour more ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed, but without the real &s;ymptoms of the fever. Whether this diagno&s;tic was given through ignorance, or as a profe&s;&s;ional trick, in order to gain applau&s;e by making many and &s;peedy cures, is un|certain; however, it was neverthele&s;s &s;o con&s;idered. Thus &s;ome phy&s;icians obtained a credit in curing the complaint, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any real merit.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF THE DISEASE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e generally, in the fir&s;t place, affected the per&s;on with a &s;en&s;e of chilline&s;s, alternating with gentle flu&s;hings&mdash;and a &s;en&s;e of &s;orene&s;s of all the mu&s;cles; the face appeared pale, the features &s;hrunk, the body weary, as if it had undergone &s;ome great fatigue, attended with yawnings and &s;tretchings of
<PB N="9" REF="024024_0008_0FC2DDF19775B4F0">
the extremities; a di&s;inclination for any bodily ex|erci&s;e; and when any exertion was made, it was at|tended with &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s and unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations. The pul&s;e at this time was weak and frequent; the men|tal faculties were likewi&s;e impaired, and frequently a &s;mall pain in the head, attended with &s;ighings and anorexy: re&s;piration being anxious and rather &s;mall at this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es, the following &s;ymptoms took place without the patient's knowledge of the former hav|ing pa&s;t: they however, in general, preceded violent pains in the head, back, and loins:&mdash;A pul&s;e more ten&s;e, full, and &s;omething increa&s;ed in fulne&s;s. (In one ca&s;e, the patient compared the pul&s;ation of the temporal arteries, to the &s;triking of a hammer again&s;t his temples.) In &s;ome, a delirium came on imme|diately after the cold &s;tage, &s;o that the per&s;ons af|fected got out of their beds, and wandered about their rooms or hou&s;es. Sometimes nau&s;ea and vo|miting appeared early in the di&s;ea&s;e, which proved very trouble&s;ome, and greatly debilitated the patient. Re&s;piration was now rather laborious than anxious; the &s;kin dry and hot, belly mo&s;t commonly co&s;tive, though &s;ome had a gentle diarrhoea from the begin|ning of the di&s;ea&s;e; no appetite, but a great de&s;ire for drink, particularly any united with vegetable acids, as the acid of lemons, &amp;c. the adnatae of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">s, in &s;ome, were much inflamed, &s;o that light became &s;carcely tolerable; the countenance, on the fir&s;t and &s;econd days, in many, appeared much flu&s;h|ed, attended continually with a violent head-ach, &s;o as frequently to produce delirium, with re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and watchings, which greatly exhau&s;ted the patient's &s;trength; the tongue was generally dry, and in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e covered with a whiti&s;h &s;curf, and the patient complained much of anxiety, or a great &s;en&s;e of weight at the praecordia: the excre|mentitious
<PB N="10" REF="024024_0009_0FC2DDF3176A33A0">
di&s;charges, whether natural or produced by art, were very fetid and di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>About the third day, the inflammatory &s;ymptoms greatly changed, to tho&s;e of a putrid kind, or a re|mi&s;&s;ion of the fever took place: if the latter did not &s;ucceed, the tongue became dry, and began to be covered with a brown or black &s;ordes: not long after the teeth and lips put on the &s;ame appearance; re|&s;piration became more anxious, with an increa&s;ed pro&s;tration of &s;trength: the vital functions at this time were much more di&s;turbed; watching, or a comato&s;e &s;tate, now took place, if it had not before appeared; and even tho&s;e who did &s;leep, enjoyed it but for a few moments, when they waked as if in a fright: the pul&s;e became &s;maller, weaker, and more frequent; thir&s;t was greatly increa&s;ed; nau&s;ea much more intolerable, together with the &s;en&s;e of oppre&s;&s;ion at the &s;tomach: tho&s;e who had not vo|mited before, had that direful &s;ymptom added now to the others: the contents of the &s;tomach, which were thrown up in the act of vomiting, were gene|rally of a fetid nature; the voice began to be changed; &s;mall petechiae appeared about the neck and brea&s;t; when the body, and even the room, unle&s;s well ven|tulated, had a cadaverous &s;mell&mdash;The patient kept continually rolling or turning in the bed, and fre|quently picking the bed-clothes. In &s;ome, the bowels at this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e were very co&s;tive, &s;o that recour&s;e was obliged to be had to artificial means, whenever it became nece&s;&s;ary to evacuate their contents: in others, a profu&s;e diarrhoea con&s;iderably increa&s;ed the weakne&s;s of their debilitated bodies. Mo&s;t generally, on the fourth or fifth day of the di&s;|ea&s;e, with tho&s;e to whom it proved fatal, all the la&s;t mentioned &s;ymptoms were greatly increa&s;ed, toge|ther with a cadaverous &s;melling &s;weat, which would appear on the body when the trunk was hot and the
<PB N="11" REF="024024_0010_0FC2DDF496276300">
extremities cold: the pul&s;e became more frequent, irregular, and &s;ometimes intermittent: the per&s;on would lay on his back, with his knees drawn up, and his body appearing as if falling down in the bed; his voice low, and &s;carcely perceptible: he was now &s;en&s;ele&s;s of per&s;ons &s;tanding around, or any of their proceedings: the pul&s;e in this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e was &s;o weak as &s;carcely to be felt: the extremities put on a livid appearance. From the comato&s;e &s;tate which had already taken place, the patient could hardly be rou&s;ed by the &s;tronge&s;t &s;timuli of &s;ound and light, though in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e he was &s;carcely able to bear the mo&s;t gentle; and if he &s;hould be rou&s;ed from this &s;ituation, in a few mo|ments the &s;ame would again &s;ucceed. The urine and &s;tools were frequently involuntarily di&s;charged; a hiccup followed, if it had not before taken place; and the per&s;on, in con&s;equence of univer&s;al debility producing inability to di&s;charge the natural &s;ecretion in the bronchial ve&s;&s;els, appeared as if choaking with phlegm, or &s;omething pent up in the trachea: convul&s;ions, or &s;ub&s;ultus tendinum, now affected the frame; the eyes put on a gla&s;&s;y appearance; and death, in a &s;hort time, clo&s;ed the &s;cene.</P>
<P>This was the general cour&s;e of the &s;ymptoms in tho&s;e to whom the di&s;ea&s;e proved mortal; but in &s;ome they came on a little &s;ooner, in others later: in &s;ome, petechiae, and even maculae and vibices, extended over the body before death, though all &s;hewed evident &s;igns of putre&s;cency directly after.</P>
<P>In one per&s;on, on the afternoon of the &s;econd day, an entire intermi&s;&s;ion of his &s;ymptoms took place: on the morning of the third, they returned with in|crea&s;ed violence, when a vomiting came on, with apthae appearing in the mouth and fauces. Upon taking a few drops of any thing in the &s;tomach, vomiting would immediately be produced, which
<PB N="12" REF="024024_0011_0FC2DE06325EBEB0">
terminated in hiccup: this continued a few minutes; it would then &s;ub&s;ide until any thing was again &s;wallowed, when the &s;ame circum&s;tances returned. Petechiae appeared on his neck and brea&s;t the fifth day; and as nothing could be retained on his &s;to|mach, he was &s;upported with gly&s;ters of broth for &s;everal days, to which, as there was no other way of admini&s;tering it, the red bark was added. The pul&s;e in this per&s;on remained good until within a few hours of his death, when it began to dimini&s;h, weaken, and became intermittent. From this time, it was remarked any thing would remain on his &s;to|mach; the hiccup cea&s;ed, and death in a few hours clo&s;ed the &s;cene. This was on the morning of the &s;eventh day.</P>
<P>In &s;ome, the di&s;ea&s;e made its appearance in a more gradual manner, without any inflammatory &s;ymptoms attending it, and mo&s;t commonly tho&s;e were protracted beyond the eleventh or fourteenth days, when a remi&s;&s;ion or intermi&s;&s;ion took place, or the per&s;on &s;unk under the di&s;ea&s;e. There were &s;ome who recovered, as well as tho&s;e who peri&s;hed, on whom petechial eruptions appeared; and the &s;tomach in many of tho&s;e who &s;urvived, was very much di&s;ordered.</P>
<P>Some had other accidental &s;ymptoms accompany|ing the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;uch as a dry tickling cough, pains in different parts of the thorax, with other catarrhal and pneumonic &s;ymptoms; &s;o that &s;ome phy&s;icians were induced to declare it a &s;imple inflammatory fever, and treat it accordingly. In other patients, a billious yellowne&s;s appeared over the &s;urface of the body, the ve&s;&s;els in the adnatae of the eyes were filled with bile, and attended with the other &s;ymp|toms of Doctor Cullen's &s;pecies of typhus, the icteroides.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="024024_0012_0FC2DE080686AF50">
Many of tho&s;e who &s;urvived the di&s;ea&s;e were a long time troubled with rheumatic pains of a chronic nature, or a &s;mall eruption over the &s;urface of their bodies, which &s;eemed to be cau&s;ed by the debilitated &s;tate in which the di&s;ea&s;e had left them; and the eruption appeared to depend particularly on a weakened action of the extreme ve&s;&s;els.</P>

<P>IN cla&s;&s;ing di&s;ea&s;es, it &s;hould be our endeavour to reduce the genera and &s;pecies to as limited a number as the nature of things will admit, ob|&s;erving due per&s;picuity in the definition of the complaint. By this means, an author is enabled to communicate his ideas with much greater facility and clearne&s;s; and indeed, one circum&s;tance which gives the moderns an a&s;cendency over the ancients, is the &s;implicity to which our profe&s;&s;ion is at pre&s;ent reduced, by means of accurate no&s;ological arrange|ment; therefore, in cla&s;&s;ing the di&s;ea&s;e which I make the &s;ubject of this di&s;&s;ertation, from the &s;ymp|toms related in the former chapter, I &s;hall &s;imply call it a <HI>typhus fever,</HI> although the greater number of ca&s;es would evidently come under the genus of &s;ynochus, as de&s;cribed in Doctor Cullen's Synop&s;is No&s;ologiae Methodicae. When, however, I differ from &s;o eminent, experienced and learned a phy&s;ician as Doctor Cullen, it is with the greate&s;t diffidence, and after a very attentive examination of the &s;ubject. It appears to me very clear, that &s;ynochus &s;hould not have a place as a genus in no&s;ology, but &s;hould only be a variety of typhus, becau&s;e both are produced by the &s;ame cau&s;e,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edin.

<P>In many contagious complaints the body appears always predi&s;po&s;ed to receive the contagion of the di&s;ea&s;e, by a proper application being made; and all that is requi&s;ite to produce it, is to be expo&s;ed to the effluvia as it flies from the body of the per&s;on affected, or fomes from clothes which have been im|bued with the contagion; as &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, &amp;c. There are others which can only be communicated by contact, or an application of matter made to an ab&s;orbing &s;urface, as &s;yphilis, &amp;c. What makes it &s;till more remarkable is, that with re&s;pect to the production of the former of the&s;e, the body is only predi&s;po&s;ed to be operated on by the contagious mia&s;ma but once in a per&s;on's life: on the contrary, a per&s;on being affected with &s;yphilis once, will not render him un&s;u&s;ceptible of receiving the contagion as often as the application of matter be properly made. Likewi&s;e, a per&s;on is not freed from the operation of the contagion of typhus fever by pre|viou&s;ly having had the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>For the production of typhus fever, particularly as it rages in this country, it is requi&s;ite the body &s;hould be in a certain &s;tate to render the per&s;on &s;u&s;|ceptible to the operation of the occa&s;ional cau&s;e, when properly applied; and this appears to be a &s;tate verging towards debility, or debility actually produced.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De&s;&s;ert. inaug.

can account for the contagion not affecting every per&s;on within the limits of its action, and carrying deva&s;tation over our globe; and in this manner only we can explain why phy&s;icians and others attending on the &s;ick in this complaint, obviate its effects, by frequently taking &s;mall quantities of &s;ome &s;timu|lating cordial, by which means the excitment of the &s;y&s;tem is kept up, and the effects of the noxious powers are avoided. On the contrary, in blockaded places, pri&s;ons, or crouded &s;hips, whenever the in|habitants, pri&s;oners, or crews, are debilitated either by a &s;canty allowance, or bad provi&s;ions, or want of fre&s;h air; if a typhus fever &s;hould happen to take place, either by foreign contagion being received, or by being produced by the already debilitated bo|dies, we &s;ee it affect almo&s;t all within the atmo&s;phere of its operation, and find the contagion increa&s;e to &s;uch a degree of virulency, as to affect others in whom predi&s;po&s;ition is &s;carcely perceptible.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the account of the Old Bailey, and Black A&s;&s;izes of Oxford.

This mu&s;t have frequently been ob|&s;erved by every phy&s;ician who has had any con&s;ider|able practice in contagious di&s;ea&s;es. Thus, &s;ome per&s;ons who attended the &s;ick in the plague of Mer&s;ailles made u&s;e of a preparation of vinegar as a preventative; but then I would rather &s;uppo&s;e they e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e more for having full confidence that the vinegar would effectually prevent their taking the infection, than from any real virtue in the preparation which they u&s;ed, although an an|ti&s;eptic.</P>

I will now take notice of a cau&s;e producing pre|di&s;po&s;ition, which perhaps is more common than any before mentioned; which is, the different de|grees of heat in oppo&s;ition to each other, termed heat and cold.</P>
<P>Heat appears to be the mo&s;t univer&s;al and natu|ral &s;timulus to the animal and vegetable world; a certain degree of it is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to be ap|plied to our bodies, in order to produce a moderate degree of excitement, which con&s;titutes health:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brown's Elements of Medicine, Sect. 221, and onward.</NOTE> but then, when this &s;timulus has increa&s;ed to any con&s;iderable degree, perhaps there is no greater or more certain cau&s;e of producing predi&s;po&s;ition, and even di&s;ea&s;e of the greate&s;t debility, and death it&s;elf. This we have an example of in all the di&s;ea&s;es of hot climates, particularly cholera and typhus fever. The degree of external heat which appears to be nece&s;&s;ary in this climate to produce healthy excite|ment, is about 65<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Romayne's MS. Lectures, Pract. Medic.

<P>It has been much di&s;puted among phy&s;icians, whether cold it&s;elf would produce typhus fever, without the concurrence of contagion.

<HEAD>OCCASIONAL, or EXCITING CAUSE.</HEAD>
<P>TYPHUS fever being &s;ometimes epidemic, as we have an in&s;tance in the di&s;ea&s;e related in the former chapter, has led many phy&s;icians to attempt the ex|planation of its occa&s;ional, or exciting cau&s;e, by &s;uppo&s;ing certain changes to take place in the atmo&s;|phere, or that the air is impregnated with particles ari&s;ing from putrifying animal or vegetable &s;ub&s;tan|ces:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir John Pringle on jail and ho&s;pital fevers.</NOTE> others again &s;uppo&s;ed it merely depended upon increa&s;ed predi&s;po&s;ition, or any thing which would produce a &s;ufficient degree of debility.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Brown's Elements of Medicine.</NOTE> However re&s;pectable the authorities which &s;upport the&s;e opinions may be, yet, if we pay a little atten|tion to the method of cure in tho&s;e fevers, and the places where they mo&s;tly rage, I am confident we will be convinced that the putrefaction of animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances is not e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to produce typhus fever; on the contrary, it cannot operate as an occa&s;ional cau&s;e, but only increa&s;es
<PB N="21" REF="024024_0020_0FC2DE2DF73EE9F0">
predi&s;po&s;ition by contaminating the air, and thereby rendering it le&s;s proper for re&s;piration; and that &s;omething more is generally wanted than predi&s;po|&s;ition already mentioned.</P>
<P>The effluvia exhaling from &s;ub&s;tances verging to putrefaction, or which have already pa&s;&s;ed into that &s;tate, has been &s;uppo&s;ed to produce a di&s;ea&s;e of a putrid nature, by being ab&s;orbed into the ma&s;s of fluids, and there producing a fermentation &s;imilar to what takes place in dead matter. In this manner of rea&s;oning, however, I &s;u&s;pect we are apt to an|nex vague and ill-defined ideas to terms; and infe|rences may be drawn from chemical laws upon in|animate matter, which, when applied to bodies en|dowed with a living principle, will by no means be ju&s;t, but &s;ubject to lead us into error.</P>
<P>If we pre&s;ume that fermentation takes place, as has been &s;uppo&s;ed, the fluids will be a&s;&s;imilated; in that ca&s;e we &s;hould only have to correct the putrid fermentation, and relieve the patient from the mo&s;t deplorable &s;ituation compatible with life; but daily experience convinces us this is not the ca&s;e. In large cities, where there is a great proportion of animal matter continually putrifying, this fever is not more common than in other places, unle&s;s con|tagion be produced by another cau&s;e. And if de|bility only were nece&s;&s;ary to produce typhus fever, we &s;hould always have it to take place whenever the body was reduced to a certain &s;tate of weakne&s;s, which we find is not the ca&s;e; for in the drop&s;y, and in many other di&s;ea&s;es, we &s;ee debility carried &s;o far as even to produce death, and no &s;uch fever appears. In &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, &s;yphilis, &amp;c. each appears to depend on a &s;pecific contagion applied to the bo|dy:&mdash;Now, if we allow typhus fever to be a conta|gious di&s;ea&s;e, which is not doubted by any one ac|quainted with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of medicine, I think
<PB N="22" REF="024024_0021_0FC2DE33AAD01928">
it will appear equally probable, that typhus fever depends on a &s;pecific contagion as well as many other di&s;ea&s;es: therefore I am of opinion, that the occa&s;ional cau&s;e of typhus fever is a contagion, or effluvia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edin. Med. Com. vol. viii. p. 196. Romayne's MS. Lec|tures, Pract.

<P>Although much has been &s;aid re&s;pecting conta|gion, by men high in medical reputation, we mu&s;t &s;till acknowledge we know little of its properties. We can only note its effects, as they take place in bodies expo&s;ed to its action; and the&s;e effects being &s;o different in per&s;ons differently predi&s;po&s;ed, that the judgment formed concerning the nature of the contagion mu&s;t be very uncertain. But, becau&s;e we cannot inve&s;tigate its peculiar nature, &s;hall we reject the idea? By no means. If we do, we may with the &s;ame propriety reject the foundation of &s;ome of the mo&s;t beautiful theories in nature.</P>
<P>The operation of contagion appears to be much more virulent near the &s;ource from whence it ari&s;es, and when it becomes diffu&s;ed in the air, it is ren|dered weaker, or entirely inert; therefore, by freely ventulating places impregnated with contagious matter, the effluvia will be &s;o divided in the atmo&s;|phere, as to render it little, or not at all, hurtful.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons frequently expo&s;ed to this contagion, or living within its atmo&s;phere, become le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of its operation than others who have not been ac|cu&s;tomed to its effects. This &s;hews the wonderful power our bodies have in accommodating them|&s;elves

&s;ome &s;tate of fermentation. A melancholy proof of this we have recorded in Stow's Chronicle, in what is called the Black A&s;&s;izes of Oxford:&mdash;<Q>On the 4th, 5th and 6th days of July, 1577, were the a&s;&s;izes held at Oxon, where was arraigned and condemned, Rowland Jenkins, for a &s;editious tongue; at which time there aro&s;e amid&s;t the peo|ple &s;uch a damp, that almo&s;t all were &s;mothered.

<P>Some phy&s;icians have &s;uppo&s;ed this fever was immediately produced, in the in&s;tance mentioned, by an exhalation from a large quantity of mud which had been thrown out of the &s;lips on the adjoining docks, near Peck's-&s;lip, where the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t ap|peared; however, this was nothing more than a mia&s;ma &s;imilar to that which ari&s;es from mar&s;hes, when acted on by the heat of the &s;un, and con&s;e|quently could not produce putrid fever any other|wi&s;e than by increa&s;ing predi&s;po&s;ition.

<P>A KNOWLEDGE of the proximate cau&s;es of di&s;|ea&s;es is nece&s;&s;ary to be under&s;tood by every phy&s;i|cian; as the chief part of the cure depends imme|diately upon it:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cullen's Practice of Phy&s;ic, parag. 4.</NOTE> But the proximate cau&s;e of fevers has eluded the re&s;earch of every one who has en|deavoured to inve&s;tigate it, at lea&s;t the inquiries into this part of medicine have not met with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s as that of many others; and at pre&s;ent our knowledge of the proximate cau&s;e of typhus fever is incomplete, and in &s;ome manner doubtful. If, however, I may be allowed to give an opinion on this &s;ubject, from the many cau&s;es which tend to produce predi&s;po&s;ition, as before related, and from the effect of the occa&s;ional cau&s;e appearing in the &s;y&s;tem, all which &s;hew the greate&s;t &s;igns of debility; a like inference may al&s;o be drawn from the only remedies which are found to have been effectual in the cure of this di&s;ea&s;e, which are either tonics or &s;timulants. I therefore think we &s;hould con&s;ider debility as the proximate cau&s;e of typhus fever; and upon this we can e&s;tabli&s;h the mo&s;t natural and effectual method of cure.</P>
<P>The doctrine of &s;pa&s;m being the proximate cau&s;e of typhus fever, although very ingenious, and &s;up|ported by the celebrated Doctor Cullen, appears incompatible with the method of cure and the phae|nomena of this di&s;ea&s;e. If &s;pa&s;m be the proximate cau&s;e, why do we not find warm bathing, blood|letting, and other anti&s;pa&s;modics, cure the di&s;ea&s;e? But the&s;e only aggravate and increa&s;e the mo&s;t dan|gerous &s;ymptoms. True, we may &s;ay that tonics
<PB N="26" REF="024024_0025_0FC2DE488746F9E0">
and &s;timulants are anti&s;pa&s;modics, and thus &s;ome may &s;uppo&s;e they effectuate a cure by relieving the &s;pa&s;m, and by giving tone to the &s;y&s;tem prevent its recurring again, &s;imilar to what takes place in the cure of tetanus and &s;pa&s;modic affections in cholera; but in this fever we have no real evidence of &s;pa&s;m, which in tho&s;e two di&s;ea&s;es we have: I therefore attribute the good effects of the&s;e remedies wholly to their obviating debility.</P>

<P>IF in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e which I have made the &s;ubject of this di&s;&s;ertation, the inflam|matory &s;ymptoms ran high, attended with delirium, want of &s;leep, great anxiety, and about the third day no remi&s;&s;ion took place, but the pul&s;e became &s;maller and quicker, re&s;piration frequent and anxious, at|tended with vomiting, and in the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e the&s;e &s;ymptoms became more &s;evere, accom|panied with cold clammy &s;weats, &s;ucceeded by pete|chia,&mdash;generally indicated an unhappy progno&s;is, particularly if the irritability of the &s;tomach was &s;uch as not to allow the retention of any medicine.</P>

<HEAD>METHOD of CURE.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h the proximate cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e as it appeared, to be debility, which, from what has been &s;aid in the former &s;ec|tions,
<PB N="28" REF="024024_0027_0FC2DE4C5EE1F5C8">
I think will appear pretty evident, I will found the method of cure in obviating debility, taking into con&s;ideration the predi&s;po&s;ing and occa|&s;ional cau&s;es.</P>

<P N="3">3d. To re&s;tore and &s;upport the tone of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t indication may be fulfilled by having the patient removed from all contagious matter as &s;peedily and effectually as po&s;&s;ible, and placed in a large chamber, which will admit of free ventulation: by this mean his own effluvia will not be allowed to &s;tagnate, but be continually carried off in the air. The temperature of the room &s;hould be governed in &s;ome mea&s;ure by the predi&s;po&s;ition of the per&s;on af|fected, and the &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e. In the beginning of this fever, per&s;ons who were naturally predi&s;po&s;ed to inflammatory diathe&s;is, and by &s;ome irregulari|ties had indirect debility produced, &s;o as to favour the operation of the occa&s;ional cau&s;e, in whom in|flammatory &s;ymptoms were generally very violent, for two or three days the temperature of the room &s;hould be below 65 degrees, &s;o that it might dimi|ni&s;h the increa&s;ed action of the &s;y&s;tem, which would tend to produce healthy excitement.</P>
<P>By having the bed-clothes and body linen changed at lea&s;t once in every twenty-four hours; and the &s;hirts &s;hould be wetted in good &s;trong vinegar, and dried without being wrung,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Romayne's MS.

<P>To fulfil the &s;econd indication. If called early in the di&s;ea&s;e, when the &s;trength of the patient was but little impaired, or if there were &s;igns of crudities in the &s;tomach, which mo&s;t generally was the ca&s;e, the admini&s;tration of an emetic<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cullen's Practice of Phy&s;ic, parag. 131 and 172. See Lind on fevers and infection.</NOTE> proved of the greate&s;t benefit, not only in unloading immediately the &s;tomach, but frequently with great relief to the pain in the head, by inducing a more equal circula|tion throughout the &s;y&s;tem. The choice of the emetic &s;hould depend on the &s;ymptoms of the pa|tient. If there were, as frequently happened, con&s;iderable inflammatory &s;ymptoms, as a pretty full hard pul&s;e, &s;kin dry, countenance flu&s;hed, with a pain in the head, an antimonial emetic &s;hould be preferred, which, whil&s;t it evacuated the contents of the &s;tomach, would relax the &s;y&s;tem more than any other: this would &s;ometimes produce a remi&s;|&s;ion, and prove a cri&s;is to the di&s;ea&s;e. On the other hand, if the per&s;on appeared debilitated, and we wi&s;hed only to clear the &s;tomach, an emetic of ipecacuanha<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cullen's Practice of Phy&s;ic, parag. 181.</NOTE> would be preferable: this would
<PB N="30" REF="024024_0029_0FC2DE54A2B0E3D0">
unload the &s;tomach without increa&s;ing debility as much as any preparation of antimony. After the operation of the emetic, in order to prevent the debility increa&s;ing, and to take off the irritability produced by the action of vomiting, an anodyne was admini&s;tered with advantage.</P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es, the fir&s;t day or two of the di&s;ea&s;e put on &s;uch inflammatory &s;ymptoms, by the in|crea&s;ed action of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, attended with violent pains of the head, and delirium, as made it nece&s;&s;ary to moderate the inflammatory diathe&s;is. This appears more immediately nece&s;&s;ary, when we come to con&s;ider the effects of violent action in the &s;y&s;tem, which frequently takes place in tho&s;e fevers; when the collap&s;e, or &s;tate of debility, in a &s;hort time will be in proportion to the inflammatory &s;ymptoms which have preceded: con&s;equently it is much better to prevent the &s;y&s;tem being worn down by too great excitement, and to endeavour to mo|derate its action in &s;uch ca&s;es by relaxing remedies; but this &s;hould be done with the greate&s;t caution, as the danger of the di&s;ea&s;e depends on the debility which en&s;ues.</P>
<P>Blood-letting being the mo&s;t effectual way of re|ducing the inflammatory diathe&s;is, was made u&s;e of by many phy&s;icians, not con&s;idering the natural ten|dency of this di&s;ea&s;e towards debility, con&s;equently putre&s;cency; but this, like almo&s;t all other conta|gious di&s;ea&s;es, particularly of this kind, bore the lo&s;s of blood very badly; and in a few hours after blood was drawn, the pul&s;e would &s;ink, when a pro&s;tration of &s;trength, and other &s;igns of debility, appeared: the di&s;ea&s;e would increa&s;e with &s;uch ra|pidity, that the power of medicine would be &s;carcely able to re&s;cue the patient from the jaws of death.</P>
<P>Whenever it be nece&s;&s;ary to moderate the action of the &s;y&s;tem, after the contents of the bowels are

<P>To re&s;tore and &s;upport the tone of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing which &s;hould claim our attention, after con&s;idering ventulation, as before mentioned, is the temperature of the patient's chamber. In this, I think we often commit an egregious error, either from taking our ideas from authors who have written on the di&s;ea&s;e, as it appears in hot climates, where the debilitating power of cold could not be obtained, or from our not having paid &s;ufficient attention to the difference between inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, and the one of which I am treating: for, if we con&s;ider that we are admini&s;tering tonics and &s;timulants to increa&s;e the excitement, and at the &s;ame time applying the debilitating power of cold, which mu&s;t dimini&s;h it, we will be fully convinced, that the degree of temperature in the room &s;hould be that which will afford a gentle &s;timulus, not to increa&s;e debility; at lea&s;t this practice will be more con&s;i&s;tent one part with the other. Another wrong conclu&s;ion which has led phy&s;icians into an error, concerning the &s;uppo&s;ed good effects of cold, is attributing the effects of pure or fre&s;h air, obtained by free ventulation, to the cold to which the patient
<PB N="32" REF="024024_0031_0FC2DE6085265818">
was expo&s;ed in obtaining this air.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lett&s;om's Ob&s;ervations and Ca&s;es on putrid fevers.</NOTE> However, &s;ince a &s;ufficient number of experiments evince the capa|bility of this di&s;ea&s;e raging with great violence in cold climates, or cold &s;ea&s;ons of the year,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">London Medical Tran&s;actions, vol. iii. p. 345.</NOTE> it ap|pears &s;ufficiently evident, that no good effects can, but many bad ones may, ari&s;e from the debilitating power of cold; but by heat being applied &s;o as to be gently &s;timulant, much benefit will en&s;ue&punc;<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Brown's Elements of Medicine, vol. ii. p. 7, 8, &amp;c.</NOTE> and at the &s;ame time we may have free ventulation:&mdash;Therefore the temperature of the patient's chamber &s;hould be about 65 degrees of Fahrenheit's &s;cale.</P>
<P>If the bowels be co&s;tive, they &s;hould be evacuated by gly&s;ters, which are not followed by the degree of debility that cathartics are; and they are better combined with vegetable acid, which acts in &s;ome mea&s;ure as an anti&s;eptic.</P>
<P>Peruvian bark, although thrown out of the ma|teria medica by the ingenious Doctor Brown and his &s;trict followers, &s;till &s;tands high on the li&s;t as one of the mo&s;t effectual remedies in the cure of fevers. We &s;hould begin the admini&s;tration of this valuable remedy as &s;oon as typhus &s;ymptoms appear, and not wait till an evident intermi&s;&s;ion or remi&s;&s;ion takes place, which frequently is not effected until the patient re&s;igns his life.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Lett&s;om's Ob&s;ervations and Ca&s;es on putrid fevers.

<PB N="33" REF="024024_0032_0FC2DE65B5D7FF20">
the bark was freely admini&s;tered in gly&s;ters, pre|viou&s;ly emptying the bowels with an acetous injec|tion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Romayne's MS. Lectures, Practice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Medicine.</NOTE> It is remarkable that the bowels generally retained the&s;e bark injections for &s;everal hours, or until they were brought away by having the acetous ones repeated; though in many ca&s;es, when the powder could not be retained on the &s;tomach, a cold infu&s;ion in water, or joined with an alkali, or a mix|ture of the tincture of bark, would be retained with the mo&s;t happy effects.</P>
<P>Spirituous fomentations of the inferior extremi|ties mo&s;t generally took off the irritability of the &s;tomach, &s;o as to enable it to retain the nece&s;&s;ary remedies, and frequently relieved it when the dire|ful &s;ymptom of vomiting had already taken place.</P>
<P>Wine, the mo&s;t natural &s;timulus belonging to the materia medica, &s;hould be given freely, and bark at the &s;ame time admini&s;tered. The be&s;t kind is old Madeira, or genuine Port; the former is to be preferred; and when the debility is very great, its &s;timulus may be increa&s;ed by heat and being &s;piced: this &s;hould be admini&s;tered in as large quantities as the patient can bear, without producing intoxication or indirect debility; though, when the di&s;ea&s;e is &s;evere, one or two bottles, or even more, may be taken in twenty-four hours with advantage. However, in the u&s;e of this remedy we &s;hould pay particular attention to the former habits of the pa|tient, as whether he has been accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of wine, or di&s;tilled or fermented liquors. If the patient has been in the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors before he became &s;ick, this would be the mo&s;t na|tural &s;timulus; and indeed in &s;uch ca&s;es we &s;hould not be able to produce a &s;ufficient excitement by wine or beer; therefore &s;pirits or brandy, in water, becomes immediately nece&s;&s;ary, and in other ca&s;es
<PB N="34" REF="024024_0033_0FC2DE6A6309A290">
may be advantageou&s;ly u&s;ed. Punch is generally very agreeable to the &s;tomach, and proves a u&s;eful &s;timulant: I have &s;een warm punch &s;top a vomiting in a very debilitated &s;tate, when nearly all the other &s;timulants had failed.</P>
<P>Beer, &s;uch as porter,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lett&s;om's Ob&s;ervations and Ca&s;es on putrid fevers.</NOTE> to tho&s;e who are accu&s;tom|ed to its u&s;e, is a very valuable remedy, and for others it frequently becomes nece&s;&s;ary to change the &s;timulus, as the per&s;on gets tired of the u&s;e of one: here porter may be u&s;ed with the greate&s;t advantage: the carbonic acid which it contains has been much extolled in the cure of putrid fevers; indeed, if there be much virtue in this acid, or air, it may be admini&s;tered in this very beautiful manner, far ex|ceeding the nau&s;eous yea&s;t remedy,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Some phy&s;icians, in the time of this di&s;ea&s;e, extolled their own peculiar remedy; and many people were led to believe, that in con&s;equence of this remedy, they cured all their patients; by which trick probably &s;ome patients might be obtained: and this was nothing le&s;s than a quantity of yea&s;t put in a decoction of bark, which being placed in a degree of heat &s;o as to ferment, was then to be taken; and in this manner they produced a quan|tity of carbonic acid. In the days of Macbride, and other &s;tick|lers for the doctrine of fixed air, or carbonic acid, being the bond of union in all animal bodies, this theory might appear plau&s;ible; but at this time it is truly laughable that they &s;hould put their dependence on &s;uch a remedy.

When delirium comes on, with all its attendants, and every &s;ymptom grows more alarming, unea&s;y days are &s;ucceeded by re&s;tle&s;s nights, and the patient is exhau&s;ted by pain and watching, a full do&s;e of opium relieves, in a mea&s;ure, all tho&s;e di&s;agreeable &s;ymptoms, and produces &s;leep, which is the &s;ick man's ely&s;ium; it revives his hope, it is his mo&s;t de&s;irable &s;tate, and by which the &s;trength and vi|gour of the &s;y&s;tem will be recruited: indeed, there are few things which wear out the &s;y&s;tem more than continual watching, which is thus happily prevented.
