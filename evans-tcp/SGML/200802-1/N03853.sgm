<HEAD>A LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Unknown Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT appearing by the Author's Con|fe&s;&s;ion, that by your's of 1&s;t of <HI>December,</HI> plain Matters of Fact were the only thing you injoin'd him, forbidding any thing of his own, I may rea&s;onably conclude you are de&s;irous without Pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or Prejudice, to form a Judgment on tho&s;e Facts (truly related) according to Truth. That it may be &s;o, and that you, <HI>Sir,</HI> and others, into who&s;e Hands the &s;aid Letter may fall, may not be impo&s;ed upon, I take the Freedom to &s;end you and them the following Remarks on that Author's Performance, whereby it will appear how far he has an&s;wered your hone&s;t Intentions, and how indu&s;trious &s;ome among us, and in par|ticular this Author (already di&s;covered) is to re|pre&s;ent the &s;aid Manufactory Scheme, in odious Colours, and thereby excite to Re&s;entment a|gain&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="004739_0003_100DD13D792B1220">
it, which they could never do, if they treated it with Truth, and related the Facts as they really are.</P>
<P>As to the Publick Currency, the Truth of the Facts with re&s;pect to the Province Bills on which he treats, lies thus: The Province being formerly deeply engag'd in War, their publick Charge was too great for their Ability to make prompt Payment. Not that they wanted Silver, but that they could not pay it into the publick Trea&s;ury. This Nece&s;&s;ity produced the Emi&s;&s;ion Bills of Credit, to be redeemed in &s;ome &s;hort Time. The&s;e finding Credit, not &s;o much by the Goodne&s;s of Merchants, as he &s;ays, as that of the Officers and Servants of the Government, who were the Creditors, and fir&s;t honoured their Bills; and the War being a&s;&s;i&s;ted thereby, more was emitted, and their Redemption carried for|ward, and the others redeemed in their Turn, and not po&s;tpon'd more than in one or two In|&s;tances. Tho&s;e Bills went for &s;ome Time Hand in Hand with Silver, until the Goodne&s;s of the Merchants of that Day, taking the Advantage of tho&s;e Paper Emi&s;&s;ions, which the Government by their afore&s;aid Nece&s;&s;ity had made, &s;hip'd off all the Silver and Gold out of the Province, to make Remittances to other Markets, having car|ried their Trade to a Pitch &s;o much above the Produce of the Country, as to require it. Im|portation increa&s;ing, and too many Hands being employed at Sea, the Land was neglected, or had not due Encouragement. Hence the Merchant would give any Price for Silver to an&s;wer his Demands abroad, which the Produce of the Coun|try could not do; by this Means they &s;unk the Credit of Paper Bills, and yet increa&s;ed the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of them; no Money being left to pay
<PB N="5" REF="004739_0004_100DD140901752E0">
contingent Publick Charges, (tho' the War being ended the People might otherwi&s;e have done it) nor none to carry on our Trade, now near double to our Ability. This put the Merchants on repeat|ed Sollicitations for more Emi&s;&s;ions, and many they obtained, &s;ome on Loans, &s;ome on Funds, all which by the afore&s;aid Means, they con&s;tantly depreciated, to their own Advantage. Thus, fir&s;t by bringing up the Price of all their Goods to what the Silver co&s;t, altho' they paid for much of them at a va&s;tly lower Price in the Produce of the Province. Secondly, by defrauding their Creditors abroad, ju&s;t &s;o much as they &s;unk the Bills in the Time they had Credit.</P>
<P>Next he tells you, <HI>Sir,</HI> that there is an unac|countable Confu&s;ion of Paper Currency here, and to prove it, mentions &s;undry Denominations of Bills pa&s;&s;ing at different Value: But he mu&s;t be an unaccountable Man to a&s;&s;ert it, for this makes no Confu&s;ion here, each one knowing the re|&s;pective Value at which they pa&s;s; and the Ar|gument lies as &s;trong again&s;t different Coins of Silver, that without Confu&s;ion pa&s;s current in mo&s;t Parts of the World.</P>
<P>Then he proceeds to inform you of two Silver Schemes emitting Bills by the Merchants; the fir&s;t of <HI>One Hundred and ten Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> in 1733, to prevent a large Emi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Bills from depreciating the Currency, which are punctually paid in Silver and Gold, and are 33 <HI>per Cent</HI> better than Province Bills. But impar|tial as he is (not &s;uiting his De&s;ign) tells you nothing of his being the principal Promoter of them both. Notwith&s;tanding his private Opinion is again&s;t any, as he tells you afterwards; don't inform you, that he and &s;ome others, have turn|ed
<PB N="6" REF="004739_0005_100DD142204D2E28">
great Part of the common Currency into Bonds, payable in tho&s;e Notes, or Silver at <HI>nine|teen Shillings</HI> an Ounce, &s;ays nothing of their ob|liging their Debtors to give Bonds in the above|&s;aid Money for their Book Debts, while large Sums of that Emi&s;&s;ion never yet &s;aw the Light, and that which did, was in a few Months board|ed up, and great Numbers by that Means alrea|dy are, or in a likely Way to be ruined, while the Notes are in the Hands of the Hoarders; and Silver is not to be had; neither does he in|form you that when this Scheme was compleat, notwith&s;tanding their giving under their Hands, not to give Credit to the &s;aid <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Bills, (which they u&s;ed as an Argument with the Go|vernment not to &s;top their Proceedings) their Bills di&s;appeared, and have not been &s;een &s;ince; and they run to taking tho&s;e Bills of <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> by an univer&s;al Con&s;ent, while their own made to prevent them, are lock'd up in their E&s;crutores.</P>
<P>As to their &s;econd Emi&s;&s;ion of <HI>One Hundred and Twenty Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> we have as little Experience of it yet (being but partly emitted) as we have hope it will ever be advantageous to any but them&s;elves. However, from its Con&s;ti|tution, one of the&s;e Events mu&s;t en&s;ue, either fir&s;t their Redemption depending on Silver &amp;c. at the End of fifteen Years, and their growing 46 <HI>per Cent.</HI> better in that Time in their Princi|pal, they will &s;oon all be boarded up, and &s;o produce the &s;ame Mi&s;chiefs, as their former Notes, &s;aving that Multitudes being &s;upplied by the <HI>Manufactory Bills</HI> at a rea&s;onable Rate, the Merchants don't find it &s;o ea&s;y now, as for|merly, to per&s;wade People to hire theirs; or &s;e|condly, if they redeem them by Bills of the com|mon Currency, as the Directors have lately pro|mi&s;ed
<PB N="7" REF="004739_0006_100DD144FB3E5608">
(no Crime in our Author to alter) then the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence is, that no Silver will be lodged in their Trea&s;ury to redeem them, common Currency an&s;wering that End. Nor no increa&s;e of a Medium by the&s;e Notes, becau&s;e the Currency mu&s;t be le&s;&s;ened in proportion, and &s;o the two profe&s;s'd Ends propo&s;ed for their E|mi&s;&s;ion, <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> the bringing in Silver, and the in|crea&s;e of the pre&s;ent Currency, intirely fru&s;trate and defeated. So this Mountain may bring forth a Mou&s;e, as the other did a Viper.</P>
<P>As to what this Author has before &s;aid, in his &s;econd Rea&s;on under his fir&s;t general Head, and often afterwards repeats as his Opinion, about private Notes invading the Prerogative: The following Di&s;tinction may &s;et that right, and quite &s;poil his mi&s;chievous De&s;ign in &s;o often a&s;&s;erting it. I di&s;tingui&s;h thus, (while no Law in force forbids) I have a natural Right to propo&s;e my Note of Credit, either Singly or in Con|junction with others, to any Man; if he will give it Credit; it's his own free Act, and if it is not adequate to what I received of him, he has no Rea&s;on to complain, he being under no Force to receive it: And this Principle corre&s;|ponds with the Nature and Manner of all Pro|ceedings in Trade and Commerce; and not only &s;o, but if I may rely on the be&s;t Accounts both in this &amp; the neighbouring Province of <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire,</HI> I have the Authority of his mo&s;t Sacred Maje&s;ty and His mo&s;t Honourable Privy Council, on my Side, in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> private Notes. This Government, at the per&s;wa&s;ion of the Merchants, who are now again&s;t all Currencys but that of their own, and that not to circulate, having pa&s;&s;ed a Law again&s;t tho&s;e Notes pa&s;&s;ing
<PB N="8" REF="004739_0007_100DD14682CA7658">
here, that Law came under Con&s;ideration at Home, when His Maje&s;ty in Council in Con&s;ide|ration that all His Subjects were free to Propo&s;e, Receive, or Reject each others Credit at Plea|&s;ure, Abrogated that Law, and pronounced it Null and Void. Which In&s;tance I hope, <HI>Sir,</HI> will &s;ettle you in that Point, altho' you have not the Concurrence of this wonderful Author.</P>
<P>By the foregoing Definition, it may evidently appear, that however it may re&s;t in the Preroga|tive to a&s;certain the Value of Money, when it is made a tender in Law, which &s;eems the chief Ground of Complaint with re&s;pect to our Cur|rency at Home, yet no Inva&s;ion is made thereon by a Currency only propo&s;ed, and no Body ob|liged to give it Credit, which is the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Next he comes to the <HI>Manufactory Scheme,</HI> the main Subject of his Letter, as he &s;ays. And here, I doubt not, <HI>Sir,</HI> but the hard Names, &s;cur|rilous Epithets, extravagant Glo&s;&s;es, and Ungen|tlemanly Language, with many plain and obvious Contradictions, (Things never needed in a good Cau&s;e) which this Author in his unconnected Ramble over this Scheme, and it's Undertakers, has u&s;ed, will induce you to give little Credit to his Performance; yet give me Leave Sir, for the more full di&s;covery of this Hard-Mouth'd Au|thor, and for clearing the Scheme, and it's Pro|moters, from his &s;candalous Reflections, (tho' I confe&s;s one can hardly come &s;o near him without Defilement) to examine his A&s;&s;ertion in Point of Fact, and his Conclu&s;ions with re&s;pect to the E|vent of this Affair.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004739_0008_100DD14806C736D8">
And fir&s;t he begins with the Subjects of this Undertaking; which he calls <HI>a va&s;t Multitude of Nece&s;&s;itous, Idle, and Extravagant People, com|bining to have Money at an ea&s;y Rate, of no de|terminate Value, which the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or cannot oblige them to accept, until after twenty Years, and with this to pay their Debts, which will depreciate the other Currencies, prejudice private Property, and damage the Merchants of</HI> Great Britain <HI>trading to</HI> New England.</P>
<P>To which I An&s;wer, that as to the Numbers being Great that are actually concerned in it, it is true, but not the tenth Part of tho&s;e that are in Heart in favour of the Scheme, and think it the be&s;t calculated Method for the Province's Good, that has yet been tho't of, but that &s;aid Partners <HI>are a Combination of &s;uch as he repre&s;ents,</HI> is as far from Truth as his Epithets are from the Rules of Decency and good Manners, or which is all one, as the Ea&s;t from the We&s;t. Can it be &s;up|po&s;ed, <HI>Sir,</HI> that the great Number of Officers Civil and Military &s;elected out of the People by a wi&s;e Governour and Council, and performing &s;o well, as that no Complaints were ever brought again&s;t one of them for Male-Admini&s;tration, be|&s;ides numbers of Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters now concerned in this Scheme, could de&s;erve &s;uch a Character? Would &s;uch Numbers of Officers (not Partners) as of late have re&s;igned their Commi&s;&s;ions (that they might be free to give tho&s;e Bills a Credit) have done &s;o to take Part with a Combination of &s;uch de&s;picable Mortals in a De&s;ign to cheat Mankind, and in which they mu&s;t &s;hare equally with others? But this (in&s;tead of Rea&s;on,) has been their Treatment all along.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004739_0009_100DD14B34FAF530">
As to <HI>the ea&s;y Rate by which the Partners have ther Money,</HI> there's no Argument in that, nor Truth in his A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>that they are not ob|liged to receive it till twenty Years, or that the Bill is of no determinate Value, that it bears</HI> no <HI>Intere&s;t;</HI> all this is notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the Partners pay 3 <HI>per Cent.</HI> for their Bills, two of which <HI>he &s;ays,</HI> will be &s;wallowed up, in the yearly Charges, to this add the Charge of In|&s;truments, apprizing of Lands, and Time &s;pent a|bout it, &amp; their clear Profit will be &s;mall compar'd with their Ri&s;que and Trouble; for which in &s;uch Ca&s;es, &s;omething may be rea&s;onable. And who would grudge them &s;ome Profit for this pub|lick Service, &s;ince none are the Loo&s;ers? Secondly, The Value of the Bill is as expre&s;s as Words can make it, being by Promi&s;e to be re|ceived not only after <HI>twenty Years</HI> on Demand, but at all Times in all Payments, Trade and Bu|&s;ine&s;s, and for Stock in the Trea&s;ury, as lawful Money at <HI>&s;ix Shillings and eight Pence</HI> per Ounce. This Promi&s;e tho' made by the Signers, yet it is for them&s;elves and Partners, and if the Partners refu&s;e it, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or has a plain Action again&s;t the Signer or Indor&s;er; but to oblige the Part|ner to receive (as before,) he executes a Covenant to the Directors for that Purpo&s;e, whereby they can, and (from Intere&s;t) will oblige him to fulfill his Promi&s;e. The Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or (as by the Scheme now on publick Record) is intitled to the Stock in the Trea&s;ury at <HI>one per Cent.</HI> lower than the Market Price, which Price he is equally intitled to &s;et with the Directors, and this gives him <HI>one per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t. As to the&s;e Bills depreciating others, not on a Silver Foundation, there will be none of them to &s;uffer at the End of one Year, for that compleats the Term of their Redemption; his Con&s;e|quence
<PB N="11" REF="004739_0010_100DD14D905BB6B0">
therefore that they will hurt private Pro|perty and the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Merchants, fails and comes to nothing.</P>
<P>And here I would propo&s;e to them, Which will hurt them mo&s;t, whether to have Money circulating to pay for their Goods in Ships built, and Cargoes bought, in about &s;ix Months, as has been the Ca&s;e when the Manufactory Bills are taken? Or whether to wait twice that Time, as &s;ome Refu&s;ers, I am informed, have done, and the Keel not yet laid, or Cargoes bought, for want of Money, and perhaps will not till their Debtor breaks, or by &s;ome other Accident they are defeated of their Debt? But then, our Author lays Stre&s;s on the length of the Period, and the largene&s;s of the Sum. As to that of the Period, the Partners Obligation to take the Bills at any Time, as before related, is an An&s;wer. And as to the largene&s;s of the Sum, had there been the &s;ame Provi&s;ion in the Province Bills, the Ri&s;e of Silver had never affected them as it did. To clear this, pray ob&s;erve, that when A gave B an advance Price for Silver, that &s;unk the Province Bills &s;o much, as A advanced in his Purcha&s;e. B, who thought he had got by the Bargain, &s;oon found his Mi&s;take; for none a|live was obliged to receive the Bills of him in Trade, at a higher Value than he received them of A, and &s;o the Bills &s;unk in Value in Trade, ju&s;t as they did in their Purcha&s;e of Silver. But here the Ca&s;e is va&s;tly different, for &s;uppo&s;e Ne|ce&s;&s;ity &s;hould oblige A as before, to give B <HI>Eight and eight Pence</HI> of the <HI>Manufactory Bills</HI> for an Ounce of Silver, when <HI>Six and eight Pence</HI> is their declared Value; would this of nece&s;&s;ity &s;ink their Value as before? No, by no Means.
<PB N="12" REF="004739_0011_100DD14FCE32C7E8">
For this obvious Rea&s;on, becau&s;e there is that va&s;t Number of Partners before &s;poken of, who are obliged to receive them of B at the Rate at fir&s;t mentioned, be&s;ides a va&s;t Stock in the Trea|&s;ury of <HI>Forty &s;ix Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> the fir&s;t Year, and &s;o on, where the Bills mu&s;t be received as before expre&s;&s;ed, at <HI>one per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. And its again&s;t Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e B will loo&s;e his Advantage, or that the Bill will depreciate by this Means, as the others did. Moreover, this Scheme being founded on the mo&s;t demandable Manufactories of the Province, it is highly probable that it will in a &s;hort Time &s;o increa&s;e our Produce as to enable our Mer|chants to &s;atisfy our Demands for <HI>European</HI> Goods, (which is one great De&s;ign of the Undertaking) and thereby take away that Demand for Silver that has always been the vi&s;ible Cau&s;e of &s;inking Bills, an Effect never to be expected from their boa&s;t|ed Silver Schemes, which on the contrary increa&s;e it's Demand, and rai&s;e its Value in proportion, and &s;o leaves us wor&s;e than they found us; whereas Silver being the Rule of the Value of the <HI>Manu|factory Bills,</HI> (while none is requir'd) has all its Advantages without the afore&s;aid Inconvenience. But if all this is too little to &s;ecure again&s;t the largene&s;s of the Sum (and which notwith&s;tanding our Author's A&s;&s;urance is difficult to determine before Hand) yet the following mu&s;t do it. If I mi&s;take not, it's allowed by almo&s;t all States-Men, that while Money will Rent at <HI>&s;ix per Cent</HI> it is not too plenty. Well, if this be a &s;afe Rule, then we are &s;ecure; for at the End of one Year of the Money's being out, <HI>Forty &s;ix Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> Old Tenor, mu&s;t be paid in to the Trea&s;ury by the Partners, either in the Bills, or in <HI>Manu|factorys,</HI> to be immediately Sold, to draw them
<PB N="13" REF="004739_0012_100DD15151F1F6B0">
in; and &s;o on, till the whole is paid in; and there it mu&s;t lie, till it will Let for <HI>&s;ix per Cent.</HI> and can't be Let out for le&s;s: which I think wards off the Evil &s;o often &s;urmi&s;ed to re&s;ult from the Greatne&s;s of the Sum.</P>
<P>But our cavilling Author will &s;ay, What's all this without &s;ufficient Security for the Perfor|mance, and accordingly tells you, that the Bills are very Ill, or not at all &s;ecured. For An&s;wer to which, I &s;hall inform you, <HI>Sir,</HI> what the se|curity is, and leave you to judge for your &s;elf, what Rea&s;on there is for this Objection. Every Partner Mortgages a Real E&s;tate (&s;aving a very few who gave Per&s;onal Security in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>) exclu|&s;ive of Buildings, Timber, Wood, and wooden Fences, which are prized at nothing, to the Va|lue of one and a half of the Money he takes out, done by five Men on Oath: The Deeds Condi|tioned for the yearly Payment of a twentieth Part of the Principal, and <HI>three per Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t. To inforce the&s;e Payments, each Partner gives a Covenant, obliging him&s;elf to make them, ac|cording to the Tenor of his Mortgage; as al&s;o to pay his Rateable Proportion of all manner of Lo&s;&s;es that may any Ways happen; be&s;ides many other Things contained therein for the better Security of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; to which Pur|po&s;e all the In&s;truments are made. Now Sir, if he pays not, Action of Covenant broken may be brought, and on Judgment obtained, Execu|tion may be Levied on his other E&s;tate from Year to Year, and Payment to Payment, and his whole Mortgage lies to &s;ecure the la&s;t Pay|ment only: Hence if all they are worth will make good their Engagements, it is liable. The Directors Security as &s;uch, be&s;ides In&s;truments
<PB N="14" REF="004739_0013_100DD15386252690">
executed to each other, obliging to the faithful Di&s;charge of their Tru&s;ts, is a Covenant they give to each of the Partners, expre&s;&s;ing the Par|ticulars of their Duty; on failure of which each Partner has his Action again&s;t each Director, by Vertue of &s;aid Covenant, which &s;ecures again&s;t all Sugge&s;tions of Corruption in the Directors.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the Surmi&s;e he pretends you make of the Merchants je&s;uitically promoting the Scheme in order to get all Paper Currencies &s;uppre&s;s'd, whether this is Genuine or not, I can't tell. But this is certain, that the Term is well adapted; for at that Game, it's notorious, he is never exceeded, and but &s;eldom equalled. Then again (as tho' hurried by &s;ome Evil Spirit) he repeats his Abu&s;es of the Contrivers, &s;ays the Scheme was contrived for their U&s;e, and in the &s;ame Breath &s;ays, it is only contrived for the Directors U&s;e, who to be &s;ure were mo&s;tly other Per&s;ons; for the fir&s;t Projector of the Scheme is no Officer. This appears, &s;ays he, from the Con&s;titution, as fir&s;t, becau&s;e their Choice is per|petual. Suppo&s;e &s;o; yet if their Labour is worth the Hire, as indeed it is, and their Bu&s;ine&s;s be|fore, was as good or better, as indeed it was, as to mo&s;t or all of them, it proves nothing to his Pur|po&s;e. But he is here (as almo&s;t every where el&s;e) out in Fact. For altho' if they behave well, and An&s;wer the publick Good, and End propo&s;ed, they may continue, and it will be for the Credit of the whole they &s;hould: yet on the lea&s;t Corruption, which his Objection &s;uppo&s;es, any four Directors concurring with the major Part of the Partners, may di&s;place the other five, or any one of them; and if that can't be obtain|ed, every Partner has his Action again&s;t the
<PB N="15" REF="004739_0014_100DD1592A281958">
delinquent Director, on failure of his Duty, as before. Which is an effectual Security again&s;t any Inconvenience on that Account. His &s;econd is, <HI>that they have a Negative on all Re&s;olves at a General Meeting;</HI> this is al&s;o fal&s;e. It's true they have in &s;ome, and as true that the Partners in Ca&s;e of need, have their Remedy as before. In his Third, he gives you a fre&s;h In&s;tance of his Ill-Nature, and <HI>grumbles at the Charge, and &s;umptuous Living on free Co&s;t,</HI> as he calls it, and that <HI>it will amount to two per Cent.</HI> all which is al|&s;o fal&s;e; and were it true, till he &s;hews &s;ome needle&s;s Expence and Wa&s;te, he proves nothing by it, but his own Rancour and peevi&s;h Di&s;po|&s;ition. And it's a poor Proof of his A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>that the</HI> South Sea <HI>Company allow'd</HI> Eight Thou|&s;and Pounds <HI>only for Management,</HI> which is more than four Times as much as the Allowance and other annual Charge of this new &amp; difficult Undertaking, which takes up all the Time and Powers of the Directors; and for which they have <HI>One Hundred and fifty Pounds</HI> per Annum each (finding them&s;elves,) and no more.</P>
<P>Then he wrangles and finds Fault with their Trade, and calls them <HI>Ludicrous,</HI> becau&s;e they Im|port that which others won't &s;ell us, &amp; that which we can't do without; whereas the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> and all other Banks well con&s;tituted (he mu&s;t mean e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law) are prohibited Trade. And the&s;e de&s;ire the &s;ame Thing, when alike cir|cum&s;tanced (their Trade not being a cho&s;en Cir|cum&s;tance) but are loath to &s;tarve in the mean Time. But then <HI>they don't under&s;tand Trade.</HI> This ought to move his Compa&s;&s;ion, rather than his Anger. That he and his Brethren force them to Bu&s;ine&s;s of which they are not capable. His
<PB N="16" REF="004739_0015_100DD15BB468FE00">
diminitive Appellation of the Gentlemen of the <HI>Bay,</HI> is very ungenerous and ungrateful, they having contributed va&s;tly to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of out Trade, and to the Wealth of this very Author in particular.</P>
<P>His next Freak is about <HI>the Alteration of the Scheme,</HI> which he thinks none have a Right to do but him&s;elf, he having altered as before men|tioned; and what then, if it be for the better, (which he don't deny) and compleated before any Obligation was made, why &s;hould he be an|gry? Why, for this very good Rea&s;on, that he and his Party will thereby be convict of a grand Impo&s;ition on the Government at Home, as well as Inju&s;tice to the Directors) by laying Mr. <HI>Colman'</HI>s Scheme, &s;o called, before them, as that on which the Bills were uttered; whereas in Truth it will ap|pear, that the true Scheme is a very different Thing, and agreed to by the Directors long after that went off from <HI>New England.</HI></P>
<P>Then he mi&s;takes the Place, where to look for the Directors Securitys, and the Truth with re|&s;pect to their being given. All that being done before they proceeded, as in other well ordered hone&s;t Schemes. And as to the Securities for their own Quota's or Shares as Partners, <HI>&s;ome Months be|fore taken up,</HI> as he fal&s;ly affirms, if he'll &s;earch again, he will find mo&s;t of them on Record, which proves that it was Hurry that prevented it before, and not an evil De&s;ign, as he would have you think.</P>
<P>In his An&s;wer to your De&s;ire <HI>to know the Nature of our landed Intere&s;t,</HI> he ought to have told you, "that it is almo&s;t ruined by our Trade;

as our Merchants manage it. It's true, <HI>Sir,</HI> Our Fore-Fathers &s;pent their Blood and Trea&s;ure, many of them, in &s;ubduing this Wilderne&s;s, and its &s;avage Inhabitants; and the Land being cul|tivated is generally exceeding Good, for &s;o cold a Climate; the People orderly, vertuous, and in|du&s;trious, but the want of Money and Hands to labour (too great a Proportion going to Sea) has brought them to the Pa&s;s our Author &s;peaks of. Tho' he has his own Ends in ca&s;ting his Veil over their Nakedne&s;s; otherwi&s;e he might have di&s;covered the Means which made them &s;o, which would be little to his Credit. The Truth is this, that the Import too much encouraged, or Ex|port too much neglected and di&s;couraged, has built up a few on the Ruins of many; the natu|ral Effect of &s;uch a State.</P>
<P>His next, being without Con&s;equence, remains without an An&s;wer.</P>
<P>His Mi&s;take about the Stock an&s;wered before, and the re&s;t of his Paragraph but a Bubble not worth Notice.</P>
<P>His double Mi&s;take again repeated about In|tere&s;t, and Acceptance, already an&s;wered.</P>
<P>That of the A&s;&s;ortment and Value of the Goods in which the Bills are to be paid, I an&s;wer thus; All the Goods in the Trea&s;ury are the Property of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or (&s;o far as his Bills will reach) and con&s;equently he will take which he plea&s;es. And the Ca&s;e va&s;tly differs from a Bond, where two Species are mentioned, as di&s;charging Con|ditions; there the Creditor is intitled to but one, but here to all, therefore has his Choice. As to the Value, it being at the Market Price, the Debtor has no more Right to decide that than the Creditor; but of this al&s;o before.</P>

His third, that the Bills will &s;upply the Trea|&s;ury, and no Manufactures paid: I An&s;wer, that's impo&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e the Sum to be paid in is bigger than what is emitted, and con&s;equently Manufactures mu&s;t &s;upply the Deficiency. And as to what Bills are paid in, they mu&s;t be pro|cured of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and by them who mu&s;t receive the Bills at the declared Value, and then who is hurt? Tho' all po&s;&s;ible Means will be u&s;ed, that Manufactures be produced for a Rea|&s;on herein mentioned.</P>
<P>His fourth, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That the Directors (the Com|pany not being a Body Politick) may emit what Bills they plea&s;e, &s;o none mu&s;t be had, lea&s;t too much be emitted. However, a Law ea&s;ily pre|vents this. But if the Argument proves any Thing, it proves too much, as by the Con&s;e|quence afore&s;aid, and &s;o mu&s;t be rejected.</P>

As to others following the Example, it is vertually an&s;wered in his fourth.</P>
<P>His &s;eventh, that the Security being among them&s;elves, may be &s;hifted at Plea&s;ure. I An&s;|wer, Can they blot out the Face of the Bill in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or's Hand? If &s;o, there may be Danger, otherwi&s;e it's irrational to &s;uppo&s;e the Directors will &s;uffer, much le&s;s agree to cancel or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the Securitys, while the Bill &s;tands out again&s;t them, and mu&s;t prove their Ruine. What can be more invidious?</P>
<P>No wonder the Government rejected the Scheme in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> as he next relates, when the

Signers of the Bills, the only Per&s;ons the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors could come at, were to have no Security given to them, as appears, to enable them to redeem the Bills. But no doubt this Author when it &s;uits his De&s;ign, will conclude that whatever once were the Senti|ments of the Government, mu&s;t always be right (let Circum&s;tances alter as they will) and 'tis a won|der we are not charg'd with Rebellion, for our proceeding contrary to what was their Mind twenty &s;ix Years ago. But tho' we e&s;cape here, he now draws up a heavy Charge indeed, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> of debauching People's Minds, in&s;tilling Principles into them de&s;tructive of the Government; and &s;o he goes on with a long Detail of Particulars, equally ridiculous, and equally fal&s;e, calculated purely to influence the Power at Home again&s;t this People, to procure a Di&s;&s;olution of our Con|&s;titution, doubting of his <HI>half Vote</HI> for the future. When in Fact (&s;aving &s;ome Oppo&s;ition made to the Merchants (by Abu&s;e extorted) and that in a very &s;mall Degree, to what they have given) there is not the lea&s;t Foundation in Truth for all the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions. But this In&s;trument of Cruelty, with ju&s;t the &s;ame Rea&s;on, takes the &s;ame Methods which his Predece&s;&s;ors the old Pha|ri&s;ees did, when they wanted Argument to hunt down the Chri&s;tian Religion and it's Promoters, they thought to effect it by repre&s;enting them as Seditious and Di&s;turbers of Government; and what was the Effect of their own Oppo&s;ition, as now, was unju&s;tly charg'd on them that peacea|bly &s;uffered under it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;elect and An&s;wer his mo&s;t material Points, as that in his fir&s;t, That <HI>for the People &s;trenuou&s;ly to a&s;&s;ert the emitting and pa&s;&s;ing any Thing as a Currency, in defiance of the King's Pre|rogative</HI>

<HI>is a high Crime,</HI> is an&s;wered before. <HI>Middletown</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>have Voted to receive tho&s;e Bills as Ca&s;h for Town Rates;</HI> intimating&mdash;that by the Words (<HI>as Ca&s;h</HI>) they <HI>invaded the King's Prerogative:</HI> But this is a fal&s;e Recital of their Words, and (I fear) wilful, and di&s;covers a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s in this Author that a bare offer|ing or receiving of the &s;aid Bills in lieu of Mo|ney or any thing el&s;e, which was their Ca&s;e, was no Inva&s;ion on the Prerogative; therefore he perverts the Words on Purpo&s;e to &s;erve his De&s;ign, at which he has an excellent Faculty. The Words are, "that they would receive the Bills in Town Rates," which no more infringes the Prerogative, than to have &s;aid, they would pay in Corn, or any other Commodity, which &s;ome Towns have done before them, and were never taxed with invading the Prerogative.</P>
<P>As to his &s;econd, <HI>why Landed Men have not a Right to make Money as well as they that have none,</HI> or why <HI>they will relinqui&s;h their Country, &s;ooner to an Invader,</HI> or why <HI>they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;uppo&s;ed eo be in Debt,</HI> or why <HI>their making Mo|ney</HI> (he means Bills) <HI>is from a de&s;tructive and wicked Principle,</HI> as he a&s;&s;erts, being beyond me to di&s;cover, I pa&s;s it by.</P>
<P>His Glo&s;&s;es in his third, are intirely groundle&s;s. No Sir, we value our Selves on a ju&s;t and hone&s;t Trade, equal to our Ability. 'Tis the Exce&s;s only we are again&s;t: &s;hould be glad to enlarge our Ability, and hope by this Scheme to effect it, (our Produce being thereby improved) in an hone&s;t and thri&s;ty way, and not by a Bankrupt Trade as at pre&s;ent, make our &s;elves a Bankrupt People, the nece&s;&s;ary and natural Effects of &s;uch a Trade.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="004739_0020_100DD167A61B37F0">
The Sub&s;tance of his fourth is this, <HI>that the People in the Charter Governments, being greatly in Favour of this Undertaking, will,</HI> it's like, <HI>exerci&s;e their Charter Liberty in chu&s;ing &s;uch to Rule them, as they think will promote it;</HI> and &s;o, &s;ays he, our <HI>Dependance on Great Britain would vani&s;h, Neg|lects of Re&s;olves of Parliament, and King's In&s;tructi|ors will en&s;ue,</HI> (he &s;eems to have chang'd his Mind &s;ince Governour <HI>B&mdash;t</HI>'s Day) he had better have &s;poken plain, and &s;aid, it is be&s;t to take away the Charters, lea&s;t the People by Vertue of them, &s;hould make Choice of &s;uch as would promote, what they judged for the publick Good, in&s;tead of others who may de&s;erve the contrary Cha|racter, which is the grand Rea&s;on of a Charter: or in other Words, lea&s;t the People by their Charter Priviledge, &s;hould give check to any arbitrary Proceedings that have or may happen, and &s;o he is for ab&s;olute Monarchy, and de&s;troy|ing the Con&s;titution, not only here but of the Nation al&s;o.</P>

<P>In his An&s;wer to your Que&s;tion, as to what has been done by the Government; had he re|garded the Truth, he would have told you, that in the Year 1739, the fir&s;t Draught of the Ma|nufactory Scheme was by Order of the Govern|ment (I mean the whole Court) laid before a Committee of both Hou&s;es cho&s;en for that Pur|po&s;e. This being done at their Order, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, if they acted not again&s;t, their Allow|ance for it's Proceeding, was nece&s;&s;arily implied; the Scheme being then in the Rough and undi|ge&s;ted, that Committee (if I mi&s;take not) Re|ported again&s;t it. However, if they did, their Report was rejected, and it was referred to next <HI>May</HI> Se&s;&s;ion for further Con&s;ideration, and all Proceedings thereon forbidden in the mean Time: This by the way &s;hews, that the Government (pro|perly &s;o called) had a Value for the Scheme in Sub&s;tance, tho' they might not like it in it's then unpoli&s;hed Dre&s;s: well, &s;trict Obedience was pay'd to this Order, &s;aving that &s;ome Amend|ments were made to obviate the Objections the Committee made again&s;t it. In the <HI>May</HI> Se&s;&s;ions 1740, it was Re&s;umed, the Committee for the Partners heard by the Hou&s;e; after which, the Que&s;tion being put, Whether it &s;hould be &s;top'd?

<PB N="23" REF="004739_0022_100DD16C6B1724A8">
again of the Affair, but they Reported no|thing again&s;t it. Then the Merchants petitioned the Court it &s;hould be &s;top'd; and great Num|bers of Anti-Petitions, with many Hundred Hands from different Parts of the Province were prefer'd, praying it might not; however, in the forenoon it was ordered that the Affair of the Merchants Petition &s;hould come on in the after|noon of the &s;ame Day. This &s;udden Appoint|ment was a &s;urprize to the &s;aid Committee, and the more &s;o, becau&s;e the Gentleman of the Law, who u&s;ually argued for them not expecting ano|ther Hearing, was gone out of the Province, and tho&s;e on the Spot not knowing of it till one a Clock; whereas the Petitioners had by their Council learned in the Law, and a popular Speaker, prepar'd in Writing the Sub&s;tance of their Ob|jections; however both Parties at Three a Clock appeared before the honourable Hou&s;e, &s;pent the whole Afternoon in Argument for and again&s;t the Scheme, and then withdrew. The Hou&s;e after a long Con&s;ultation and Debate, and &s;un|dry Alterations being made in the Scheme the mean while, came to a Vote in manner as be|fore, and it pa&s;&s;ed in the Negative by two to one. After which farther Amendments being made, &s;undry principal Members of the Hou&s;e that vo|ted again&s;t it, became in Favour of it, and their Number increa&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t, that on a Motion made to the Hou&s;e to Re&s;ume the Con&s;ideration of it, &s;ome Months after (on the Que&s;tion put) but about twelve Hands in that large A&s;&s;embly were in the Affirmative, and &s;o they (to wit, the Part|ners) proceeded, having no Rea&s;on (they appre|hended) to expect the Re&s;entment of the Court (which indeed they have never had) nor of the Governour and Council till &s;everal Months after
<PB N="24" REF="004739_0023_100DD16EA82701C8">
their Officers were cho&s;en, and many Hundred legal In&s;truments duly executed on all Hands, and large Quantities of the Bills emitted, by which it became impo&s;&s;ible for them to Retract; this &s;hews how they proceeded, and how far they are chargeable with Contempt of Government.</P>
<P>It is true, the Governour and Council by way of Caution, did i&s;&s;ue a Proclamation again&s;t taking tho&s;e Bills, &s;omething earlier than before men|tioned: But that being on Suppo&s;ition they were not for the publick Good, all that tho't otherwi&s;e, notwith&s;tanding took them, as they thought, with|out Contempt, the Government not being again&s;t it, or any Order to the contrary. When the Pro|clamations for dive&s;ting of Officers came out, Numbers that had proceeded as before related, Men of e&s;tabli&s;hed Characters, and known U&s;eful|ne&s;s, both of the Civil and Military Order, con&s;|cious of the Ju&s;tice of the Cau&s;e, as well as the cautiou&s;ne&s;s of their Proceedings (before related) re&s;igned their Commi&s;&s;ions, and others not their Inferiours were turned out and di&s;carded for pro|ceeding in this Affair, but according to their le|gal Obligations, in a Thing they might not have entred into, had not they been encourag'd as before.</P>
<P>On this, whole Troops, nay almo&s;t whole Re|giments of as good veteran Officers as any in the Province, no ways concerned, or ever intending to be, but from a Per&s;wa&s;ion of the publick Ne|ce&s;&s;ity and U&s;efulne&s;s of this Work, either actually Re&s;igned, or informed their Colonels, when by them examined by Order of the Governour, whether they took the Bills, that they would Re&s;ign, rather than not encourage that Affair. But mo&s;t of this not &s;uiting your Author, he leaves it out, as tho' aware, that &s;uch a Conduct, in
<PB N="25" REF="004739_0024_100DD1702D84AA08">
&s;o many Men of Note, mu&s;t &s;trongly &s;ugge&s;t to an impartial Mind, that this Work is another Thing than what it has been repre&s;ented to be.</P>
<P>In his next, he propo&s;es a Hearing, this would be happy for the Partners, could it be had with Convenience, who have &s;uffered only where they have not been heard, always ju&s;tified where they have; and whatever they may loo&s;e by the Trial, they would undoubtedly regain their injured good Name, &amp; Reputation, &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly endeavour|ed to be taken from them.</P>
<P>To his non&s;en&s;ical &s;econd Paragraph, <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> that the Partners receive no valuable Con&s;ideration for their Deeds; I only Note, that he tells you before, that all that the Directors are worth, would not redeem <HI>two per Cent</HI> of the Bills, which now, he &s;ays, are no valuable Con&s;ideration to them that receive them.</P>
<P>His third, about Compa&s;&s;ion in the Govern|ment, being only a Reflection on the Govern|ment, I leave him to an&s;wer for it.</P>
<P>Then he &s;ays, the Government will deal as natural Parents do with Children committing &s;ome Follies after repeated Admonitions; To which I &s;ay, They may expect it, as they are always ready to &s;ubmit to the Government they are under, and would rejoyce and think them|&s;elves happy to be fairly heard before them.</P>
<P>In his next (the Bubbles being &s;till in his Mouth, not having fully vented his Corruption) In Com|binations &amp;c. (&s;ays he) the Guilt of the Projectors and Managers is always from a corrupt Principle, but the Errors in their Followers (the Multitude) is from a Mi&s;take in Judgment.</P>
<P>I An&s;wer, Here by a plain Contradiction of him&s;elf, he would now &s;eem to acquit the Part|ners from the Charge of Iniquity, who before he
<PB N="26" REF="004739_0025_100DD173C37ABF40">

But now this is no wicked Principle, but all an Error in Judg|ment in his Account, becau&s;e they were not the Contrivers, or Managers of the Contrivance (he mu&s;t mean) for a Manager after the Con&s;titution is &s;ettled, is no more chargeable with the wicked Principle, on which it is founded, than any other Partner; but &s;o he will mi&s;s the Aim that hurried him thus to contradict him&s;elf, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the Condemnation of the Directors: For by this they will get clear too; for they were not the Contrivers of the Scheme, being in Sub&s;tance projected and draughted long before they were cho&s;en, or mo&s;t of them had ever heard of it, and all they did was to Reform it, and &s;trike out what was Ill. And the Drafts Man (then and now a private Per&s;on) told me, that when he had pro|jected and compleated his Work, this Author, before he entred on his &s;econd Scheme, declared it was the be&s;t Thing for the Country's Good, that he had &s;een, and admired the Ingenuity of the Performance.</P>
<P>He now tells you he has given you his Thoughts &amp;c. (altho' he was only to relate Facts) in the mo&s;t impartial Manner he was able; tho' there is &s;carce one Paragraph or Sentence in his whole Performance re&s;pecting the Affair, but what is fal&s;e in the Fact or in the manner of relating it; however they are his Thot's, and no doubt in|jected by &s;ome Evil Spirit.

<P><PB N="27" REF="004739_0026_100DD176F0231EC0">

Great Numbers of Families, e&s;pecially in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> mu&s;t either have &s;uffered, or been a publick Charge, as good Authors relate, had it not been for tho&s;e Bills. Some Thou&s;ands of Pounds by a moderate Computa|tion are &s;aved in Law Suits for Debt, by Means of the&s;e Bills. Twenty Pounds in one In&s;tance, preventing ten Actions; and indeed their Currency is &s;o general now, notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t Oppo&s;ition they have had, that it may be affirmed with Truth, as well as good Rea&s;on, (the&s;e Bills being better founded than any heretofore emitted) that no other whatever, with a like Oppo&s;ition, could have gained the Credit they have done: And the Mi&s;ery, Grief and Calamity of this People, if this Affair is broken up will be un&s;peaka|ble. I would therefore humbly propo&s;e, whether in this Ca&s;e, if any Amendments are wanting the better to render this a Publick Good, it would not be be&s;t it &s;hould be done by a Law, to which all Men would heartily agree. rather than by ab&s;olute Authority to &s;uppre&s;s this Undertaking now carried to &s;uch a Length as that many Thou&s;ands of innocent well di&s;po&s;ed Per|&s;ons mu&s;t be thrown into the greate&s;t Confu&s;ion, be|&s;ides (which is much wor&s;e) the whole Province falling again into tho&s;e melancholly Circum&s;tances, which by the Scarcity of Money, they have been of late labour|ing under.</P>
