<HEAD>PART I. To HUSBANDS and WIVES.</HEAD>
<P>THE words of the apo&s;tle, in <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> v. 32. "this is a great mi&s;tery, but I &s;peak concerning Chri&s;t and the church," naturally lead to two inquiries.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. What is the mo&s;t obvious meaning of the word church in the &s;criptures?</P>
<P N="2">2d. How doth the marriage union convey, as in a mi&s;|tery, the union of Chri&s;t and the church?</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<P>For the mo&s;t obvious meaning of the word church in the &s;criptures, we may look into the various texts where it is mentioned.</P>
<P>I do not recollect that the word is any where u&s;ed in the old te&s;tament. The apo&s;tle, in <HI>Acts</HI> vii. 38. u&s;es it for the old te&s;tament church, "this is he that was in the church in the wilderne&s;s with the angel," &amp;c. The words that are u&s;ed in the old te&s;tament are a&s;&s;embly and congregation; <HI>Exodus</HI> xii. 6. "the whole a&s;&s;embly &s;hall kill it in the evening," that is, the whole church of I&s;rael that were bound to keep the pa&s;&s;over; <HI>P&s;alm</HI> xxii. 22. "In the mid&s;t of the congregation will I prai&s;e thee," which the apo&s;tle, in <HI>Hebrews</HI> ii. 12. calls the church, "in the mid&s;t of the church will I &s;ing prai&s;e unto thee."</P>
<P>In the new te&s;tament, the fir&s;t mentioned place I recol|lect, is <HI>Matthew</HI> xvi. 18. "upon this rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it." Upon this rock the truth Peter had made confe&s;&s;ion of, "thou art the Chri&s;t, the &s;on of the living God," is the
<PB N="4" REF="018214_0003_0FA5C1A173AE4150">
rock on which the church is built, again&s;t which the gates, the power and policy of hell, &s;hall not prevail.</P>
<P>Then in the 18th of <HI>Matthew,</HI> 17. in which, &s;o far as I under&s;tand, Je&s;us Chri&s;t is in&s;tructing his di&s;ciples their duty in their particular connection, tho&s;e believers of of the apo&s;tles doctrine collected in the profe&s;&s;ion of of the name of Je&s;us, meeting together in one place, was called the church in that place. In <HI>Acts</HI> viii. 1. we read of the church which was at Jeru&s;alem, the fir&s;t church gathered by the apo&s;tles after the de&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t; <HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 1. of the church at Antioch; <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 7. and <HI>Revelations</HI> ii. 1. of the church of Ephe&s;us; <HI>Romans</HI> xvi. 3 5. and 1&s;t of <HI>Corinthians,</HI> xvi. 19. we read of the church in the hou&s;e of Pri&s;cilla and Aquilla; in <HI>Collo&s;ians</HI> iv. 15. of the church in Nymphas's hou&s;e, and of the church in Philemon's hou&s;e, in the 2d ver&s;e of that epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>The&s;e particular churches, gathered by the apo&s;tles doctrine, was governed by the will of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as taught by them; and &s;o far as that can be under&s;tood from the &s;criptures, are the rule by which particular churches of Chri&s;t are to be governed in all ages; but as that would be too lengthy to be here con&s;idered, mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed over.</P>
<P>We read al&s;o of the church of the fir&s;t born, written in heaven, <HI>Hebrews,</HI> xii. 23; of the church for which Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf, "that he might &s;anctify and clean&s;e it, by the wa&s;hing of water through the word, that he might make it to him&s;elf a glorious church, not having &s;pot or wrinkle, or any &s;uch thing, but that it might be holy and without blemi&s;h." <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> v. 26. 27.</P>
<P>Hence I collect, 1&s;t. That Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the founda|tion on whom the church is built.</P>
<P>2d. That tho&s;e that were brought by the apo&s;tolick doc|trine concerning him, to believe that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t. in the fir&s;t ages of chri&s;tianity, were by apo&s;tolick authority collected into di&s;tinct, particular churches, in &s;uch places where there were a &s;ufficient number of believers for that purpo&s;e, and were called the church in that place. There is little &s;aid about the place of their meeting: I &s;uppo&s;e any place that they could obtain, that was convenient for
<PB N="5" REF="018214_0004_0FA5C1A2341EC9E8">
that purpo&s;e: The church of Troas met in an upper cham|ber; <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 7. 8. the church of the Collo&s;ians in Phile|mon's hou&s;e, as may be &s;een by comparing tho&s;e two epi&s;tles.</P>
<P>The&s;e churches appeared as a repre&s;entation of the uni|ver&s;al church, in their holding the one truth, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the &s;on of God, by which they were all gathered together, this being the &s;ole foundation on which the univer&s;al church is built, and in their profe&s;&s;ed &s;ubjection to the authority of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the head of the church, and head over all things for its good.</P>
<P>3dly. That there is a univer&s;al church, which will con|&s;i&s;t of all that are included in that glorious church for whom Je&s;us Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf; the full meaning of which is the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t born, written in heaven; Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the fir&s;t born among the many brethren brought to glory. <HI>P&s;alm</HI> lxxxix. 27. "I will make him my fir&s;t born, higher than the kings of the earth;" <HI>Romans</HI> viii. 29. "the fir&s;t born among many bre|thren;" <HI>Collo&s;ians</HI> i. 15. "who is the fir&s;t born of every creature,"&mdash;ver&s;e 18. "the fir&s;t born from the dead." It is his church the church of the fir&s;t born; this church, this general a&s;&s;embly, called <HI>P&s;alm</HI> cvii. 32. "the a&s;&s;embly of the people, the congregation of the elders," <HI>P&s;alm</HI> cxi. 1. "the a&s;&s;embly of the upright, and the congregation," <HI>P&s;alm</HI> clxix. 1. "the congregation of the &s;aints," that are repre&s;ented to John, <HI>Revelations</HI> v. 8. by the four living creatures and four and twenty elders, and chap. vii. 9. by a great multitude, which no man could number, of all na|tions and kindred, and people and tongues, in addition to the hundred, forty and four thou&s;and, that were &s;ealed in the former part of the chapter&punc; of all the tribes of I&s;rael. The &s;ame &s;ealed number are repre&s;ented, in chap. xiv. 1. to 5. "&s;tanding with the lamb on the mount Zion," which did not exclude the preaching of the go&s;pel to every na|tion and kindred and tongue and people, ver&s;e 6; which go&s;pel or word &s;hall not return void, but &s;hall accompli&s;h what he plea&s;es, and &s;hall pro&s;per in the thing where unto he &s;ends it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="018214_0005_0FA5C1A32F10D7E8">
Of this church every believer of the apo&s;tles te&s;timony, or every one that believeth that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, accord|ing to Peter's confe&s;&s;ion, appears&punc; upon the confe&s;&s;ion of this faith, to be a vi&s;ible member. And it is the duty of every &s;uch per&s;on, who can find a particular church built on this foundation, and who in &s;ubjection to his authority make the apo&s;tolick churches their rule as to order, to join with them in the profe&s;&s;ion of his name, with them ob&s;erv|ing all things what&s;oever he has commanded, walking to|gether in love, as he hath given commandment; for this they are cho&s;en and called to the faith of the go&s;pel, 1&s;t of <HI>Peter,</HI> ii. 9. Such are made u&s;e of for the ingathering of others. 1&s;t of <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> 1. 8. "for from you founded out the word of the Lord;" <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> i. 9. 10. "having made known to us the mi&s;tery of his will, according to his good plea&s;ure, which he hath propo&s;ed in him&s;elf, that in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fullne&s;s of times, he might gather to|gether in one all things in Chri&s;t, both which are in hea|ven and which are on earth, in him." But the Ephe&s;ian church being cho&s;en in him before the foundation of the world, to be holy and without blame before him in love, being prede&s;tinated to the adoption of children by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, according to the good plea&s;ure of his will, to the prai&s;e of the glory of his grace, was not to the final exclu|&s;ion or reprobation of others, but as a means made u&s;e of by him, that in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the fullne&s;s of times, he might gather together all things in Chri&s;t; chap. ii 7. "that in the ages to come he might &s;hew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindne&s;s towards us through Chri&s;t Je&s;us." The church then is to hold forth the word of life; the word is to &s;ound out from them. "As oft as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do &s;hew forth the Lord's death till he come:" Thus they boldly bear his name, in oppo&s;ition to earth and hell; &s;hew that he is pre|cious, and hold forth to the world, that there is no other name under heaven given among men, whereby they mu&s;t be &s;aved. Such are the means the great head of the church makes u&s;e of, as he plea&s;es, to the conviction of others: But be the con&s;equences what they will, it is their
<PB N="7" REF="018214_0006_0FA5C1A6CF23F230">
duty to te&s;tify to his name, truth and ways, looking for the time when he will gather all the fruit of his purcha&s;e into one in him&s;elf; for every one for whom Chri&s;t died, &s;hall certainly, in his time and way, come to the know|ledge of him, and to partake in his &s;alvation, as tho&s;e who have been or are vi&s;ible members of his church.&mdash;For doth not the &s;criptures &s;hew the connection of the hu|man race with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as their head, in as exten|&s;ive a view as their connection with the fir&s;t Adam, &s;ee <HI>Romans</HI> 5, 14, to the end; <HI>Hebrews</HI> ii. 9. "we &s;ee Je&s;us, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the &s;ufferings of death, crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace of God, &s;hould ta&s;te death for every man." 1&s;t. of <HI>John,</HI> ii. 2. "he is the propitiation for our &s;in; and not for ours only, but for the whole world." And the apo&s;tle &s;ays, 2d. of <HI>Corinthians,</HI> v. 14. to the end, "we thus judge, if one died for all, then all died; and he died for all, that they which live, &s;hould not henceforth live to them&s;elves, but to him that died for them, and ro&s;e again." This appears to be the de&s;ign of the manife&s;tation of this truth, or of per&s;ons being brought to the knowledge of the truth, and to life in Chri&s;t thereby, that they which live &s;hould not henceforth live to them&s;elves, but to him that died for them, and ro&s;e again;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The thought of this is enough to croath wi&s;h &s;hame, as a garment, tho&s;e who have hope of life by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that this de&s;ign has been no more attended to.

Amen."</P>
<P>The go&s;pel was fir&s;t publi&s;hed to them, beginning at Je|ru&s;alem; upon their rejecting it, the apo&s;tles are &s;ent

to the Gentiles, and are taught to call no man com|mon or unclean; what God hath &s;anctified, call not thou common, which the apo&s;tle explains, <HI>Acts</HI> x. 28. "God hath &s;hewed that I &s;hould call no man common or un|clean." Why? Becau&s;e God hath &s;anctified them; I view them &s;anctified, in that Chri&s;t died for all, and de&s;igns in his time and way to bring them all to the knowledge of him&s;elf, and manife&s;t his &s;anctifying and &s;etting them apart for him&s;elf. This de&s;troys all di&s;tinction between Jew and Gentile, and not only as the nations of Jews and Gentiles, but of all men in every age, that on &s;ome account or other, be&s;ides the atonement, would pre&s;ume to be in, or near, or have a claim upon the divine favour before &s;ome of their fellow creatures. Henceforth know we no man after the fle&s;h, "yea, though we have known Chri&s;t after the fle&s;h, yet now henceforth know we him no more;" Je&s;us Chri&s;t was a mini&s;ter of the circumci&s;ion, was made under the law, fulfilled the righteou&s;ne&s;s of it, came to his own, &s;ent his go&s;pel fir&s;t to the Jews; but when his death and re&s;ur|rection were fully made manife&s;t, and the premi&s;es under|&s;tood, that all the families of the earth were to be ble&s;&s;ed in him, that the Gentiles were to glorify God for mercy; when the&s;e things were mad, fully manife&s;t, the apo&s;tle &s;ays, "yea, though we have known Chri&s;t after the fle&s;h, yet now henceforth know we him no more; therefore if any man be in Chri&s;t a new creature, the&s;e old things are pa&s;&s;ed away, behold all things are become new." There is not a fragment of the old di&s;pen&s;ation or of the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of our own, can have any admi&s;&s;ion as recommend|ing us to the divine favour, "all things are become new. and all of God, who hath reconciled us to him&s;elf," us, the apo&s;tles and fir&s;t di&s;ciples, with the church of the Corinthians, to whom he wrote, who were together vi&s;ibly reconciled to him&s;elf by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, "and hath committed to us the word of reconcilation;" that is, the word of reconciliation committed to the apo&s;tles, "that God was in Chri&s;t re|conciling the world to him&s;elf; not imputing their tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es unto them." Now then, if God was in Chri&s;t re|conciling the world unto him&s;elf; if he be the propitiation
<PB N="9" REF="018214_0008_0FA5C1AA931C5968">

for the whole world; if he ta&s;ted death for every man; if Adam was a full figure of him that was to come, and the connection of the human race with Je&s;us Chri&s;t as their head as exten&s;ive as their connection with the fir&s;t Adam, then we mu&s;t conceive that the church of the fir&s;t born, the church for which Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf, will finally con&s;i&s;t of all nations, kindreds, tongues and people; and in this view, the de&s;ign of mercy for bids, calling any man com|mon, and lays a &s;ure foundation of univer&s;al love and be|nevolence to all the human race, and of faith in prayer for them; while tho&s;e brought to believe that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, profe&s;&s;ing their faith in, and &s;ubjection to him, and appearing influenced thereby, are &s;ubjects of that go&s;pel charity which the apo&s;tle enjoins, when he &s;ays, "have fervent charity among your&s;elves," and which I think appears evidently di&s;tingui&s;hable from the univer|&s;al benevolence due to the whole human race.</P>
<P>Thus from the mo&s;t obvious meaning of the pa&s;&s;ages where the word church is u&s;ed in &s;cripture, the&s;e things have been collected. 1&s;t, That Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the foun|dation on which the church is built. 2dly, A collection of believers profe&s;&s;ing his name, and in &s;ubjection to his authority ob&s;erving his laws, in any place, are a vi&s;ible church there, or a vi&s;ible repre&s;entation of the univer|&s;al church. 3dly. The univer&s;al church will finally have gathered into it, or be made up of all for whom Chri&s;t died.</P>
<P>The &s;econd inquiry is, How doth marriage convey, as in a mi&s;tery, the union of Chri&s;t and the church?</P>
<P>Attention to this inquiry will lead us to compare this pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> with the beginning of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> and various other pa&s;&s;ages, one with another. In <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> i. 27. we read, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him, male and female created he them." There appeared to be male and female created in the one man: The particular formation of building of the woman was from man, of which we have the account, <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> ii. 21. 22. "And the Lord God cau&s;ed a deep &s;leep
<PB N="10" REF="018214_0009_0FA5C1AB3597B618">
to fall upon Adam, and he &s;lept<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As Adam was a figure of him that was to come, may not this deep &s;leep prefigure the death of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, from which the church ari&s;es.</NOTE>; and he took one of his ribs and clo&s;ed up the fle&s;h in&s;tead thereof; and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, builded<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Hebrew in the bible margin.</NOTE> he a woman, and brought her unto the man." Thus the woman "is of the man, and for the man," 1&s;t of <HI>Corin|thians,</HI> xi. 8. 9. So is the church, in every view, of and for Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>Romans</HI> xi. 36. "for of him, and to him, and through him, are all things." <HI>Collo&s;ians</HI> i. 16. "all things were created by him and for him." As the woman was created in him, was of him and for him, &s;o they are called by one name, or &s;he bears his name. <HI>Ge|ne&s;is</HI> v. 2. "male and female created he them, and called their name Adam." When &s;he was brought to him, he &s;ays, "&s;he &s;hall be called woman, becau&s;e &s;he was taken out of man." She &s;hall be called by a name derived from that of man. So the church is called by the &s;ame name with Je&s;us Chri&s;t; <HI>Jeremiah</HI> xxiii. 6. and xxxiii. 16. "he and &s;he are called, the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s." Yet, &s;o as to be denominated from him, "he &s;hall be called a Nazarene," they "the &s;ect of the Nazarenes;" he is call|ed Chri&s;t, "the di&s;ciples were fir&s;t called Chri&s;tians at Antioch;" names derived from him, &s;hewing that with|out him they were nothing; that he is their all, and that in him they po&s;&s;e&s;s and enjoy all good.</P>
<P>We have the rea&s;on of this name, "This is now bone of my bone, and fle&s;h of my fle&s;h; &s;he &s;hall be called wo|man becau&s;e &s;he was taken out of man." "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies; he that loveth his wife loveth him&s;elf, for no man ever yet hated his own fle&s;h, but nouri&s;heth and cheri&s;heth it, even as the Lord the church, for we are members of his body, of his fle&s;h, and of his bones." The circum&s;tances of the church with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are &s;imilar to that of Adam with his wife, bone and fle&s;h. "For this cau&s;e &s;hall a man leave his father and mother, and be joined to his wife, and they two &s;hall be

one fle&s;h: This is a great mi&s;tery, but I &s;peak concerning Chri&s;t and the church."</P>
<P>"This is a great mi&s;tery;" the mi&s;tery, that in marriage conveys the union of Chri&s;t and the church, appears herein: That the woman was created in the man, was united to him before &s;he was di&s;tinctly builded a woman: When &s;he was thus builded and brought to him, there appeared the vi&s;ible marriage union; he &s;aid, "this is now bone of my bone and fle&s;h of my fle&s;h." "Therefore &s;hall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife." Therefore, becau&s;e of the previous union that was the ground of it, "but I &s;peak," &s;ays the apo&s;tle, "con|cerning Chri&s;t and the church," this holds forth the union between Chri&s;t and the church, prior to the vi&s;ible mar|riage union which takes place upon any of the children of men being brought to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who &s;ays, "for no man can come to me, except the Father which hath &s;ent me, draw him."</P>
<P>In <HI>Romans</HI> xvi. 7. Andronicus and Junia are &s;poke of as in Chri&s;t before the apo&s;tle, though they were together cho&s;en in Chri&s;t before the foundation of the world. Thus is the whole church in Chri&s;t, in the mo&s;t univer&s;al &s;en&s;e: He &s;tands an&s;wering fully to the figure of him that was to come, the head of every man, a univer&s;ally as Adam was. In this view there is a union or connection of head and members, even before the members actually appear. "And for this cau&s;e &s;hall a man leave father and mother and cleave to his wife." Je&s;us Chri&s;t left father and mother in cleaving to his wife; <HI>John</HI> xvi 18. "I came forth of the father, and am come into the world."

"who of God is made unto her wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and redemption." It is vi&s;ibly &s;o with re&s;pect to tho&s;e that are brought by the go&s;pel to the knowledge of, faith in, and &s;ubjection to him: It was really &s;o in the purpo&s;e and purcha&s;e of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, before they came to the knowledge of him, and is really &s;o re&s;pecting tho&s;e who yet know him not, live in unbelief and di&s;obedience; for, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>Hebrews</HI> ii. 8. "then hath put all things in &s;ubjection under his feet; for in that he put all in &s;ubjection, he left nothing not put under him; but now we &s;ee not yet all things put under him: But we &s;ee Je|&s;us for the &s;ufferings of death crowned with glory and ho|nor, that he, by the grace of God, &s;hould ta&s;te death for every man." And the prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> gives us the divine oath for this, chap. xlv. 22. "Look unto me," (the ju&s;t God and the Saviour) "and be ye &s;aved, all the ends of the earth, for I God and none el&s;e; I have &s;worne by my|&s;elf, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;hall not return, that to me every knee &s;hall bow, every tongue &s;hall &s;wear, &s;urely &s;hall &s;ay, in the Lord have I righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength, to him &s;hall come;" which mu&s;t make all that are incen&s;ed again&s;t him a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>The name of the vi&s;ible church is, "the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s." All that are brought to him call him &s;o, and are denominated by it, "'tis the name whereby &s;he &s;hall be called." But we have the divine oath, that "every knee &s;hall bow, and every tongue &s;hall &s;wear, &s;urely &s;hall &s;ay, in the Lord have I righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength." The time and manner is with him, who &s;aith, "I will work and who &s;hall let it;" "who will have all men to be &s;av|ed and come to the knowledge of the truth; for there is one God, even one mediator, of God and man, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;ti|fied in due time."</P>
<P>In Chri&s;t Je&s;us, God manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, we have the fullne&s;s of the divine nature, as i. e. pre&s;&s;ed in <HI>Hebrews</HI> i. 3.

Is there not the fullne&s;s of the human nature al&s;o in him? The apo&s;tle &s;ays, "we are members of his body, of his fle&s;h, and of his bones," Who does he mean? Doubt|le&s;s the church, the apo&s;tles, the fir&s;t di&s;ciples, the church of the Ephe&s;ians, who were vi&s;ibly &s;o, and tho&s;e who &s;hould believe through their word, in every age; yea, all for whom Je&s;us Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf. The church, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, are in this union, and are repre&s;ented tra|veling together in pun, till the manife&s;tation of it. <HI>Romans</HI> viii. 22. "for we know that the whole creation," it is the &s;ame word we have in <HI>Mark</HI> xvi 15. "preach the go&s;pel to every creature;" therefore every creature that the go&s;pel is to be preached to, "groaneth and traveleth in pain together; and not only they, but we our&s;elves that have the fir&s;t fruits, even we our&s;elves groan within our&s;elves, waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body." By the redemption of our body, I conceive the idea of the body of which Je&s;us is the head, as captivated, en&s;lav|ed, &s;old, and groaning under this bondage; and tho&s;e who&s;e minds have been led to an under&s;tanding of re|demption by Chri&s;t, though their minds are thereby re|lieved, yet groaning, waiting for the adoption, the re|demption of the whole body.</P>
<P>Now that in Je&s;us Chri&s;t there is the fullne&s;s of the hu|man nature, is it not evident from the con&s;ideration of <HI>Ge|ne&s;is</HI> v. 2. where we read of our fir&s;t parents in their primi|tive &s;tate, "male and female created he them, and ble&s;&s;ed them, and called their name Adam, in the day they were created." Whom he ble&s;&s;es are ble&s;&s;ed; for his gifts are without repentance. So when we have the account of their being &s;educed from their allegiance, brought under bondage, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed captive by &s;atan, the cur&s;e is denounced upon the &s;erpent, <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> iii 4; but the way opened through which the original ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. pronounced in the day they were created, &s;hould be accompli&s;hed, ver&s;e 15, although they could not &s;in without &s;mart and &s;orrow; to the woman.

And as the way in which the original ble&s;&s;ing that was forfeited was to be re&s;tored and confirmed, was brought to view in the 15th ver&s;e; &s;o it is repeated and illu&s;trated in <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> xii. 3. xviii. 18. xxii. 18. and xxvi. 4.

<P>Now this ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the nations, of which the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages &s;peak, was to have its accompli&s;hment in the &s;eed of Abraham, "In thy &s;eed;" which is Chri&s;t. <HI>Gallations</HI> iii. 6. Now if all the nations of the earth are included in the

ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, they are in him as their head; there is the fullne&s;s of the human nature in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; &s;o they were con&s;idered in him before the evidences of it appeared in or upon any of them; and becau&s;e of this union, he is engaged in all the doth for them, to bring them to him&s;elf. "This is now bone of my bones, and fle&s;h of my fel&s;h; &s;he &s;hall be called woman becau&s;e &s;he was taken cut of man." "Therefore," becau&s;e of the pre|vious union, "&s;hall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, and they &s;hall be one fle&s;h: This is a great mi&s;tery, but," &s;ays the apo&s;tle, "I &s;peak concerning Chri&s;t and the church." "This is now bone of my bone, and fle&s;h of my fle&s;h; &s;he &s;hall be called woman;" &s;he &s;hall wear my name, come into a vi&s;ible connection and intercour&s;e with me, be intere&s;ted in what I am and have, &amp;c. So in con&s;equence of this union &s;hall the church, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, even every member, from all the ends of the earth, be brought to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in his times, who is the ble&s;&s;ed and only potentate; &s;hall bear his name; be called by the name which the mouth of the Lord doth name: 'Tis by his authority we are a&s;&s;ured, &s;he &s;hall be called "the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s." The&s;e things &s;hall be made manife&s;t when <HI>P&s;alm</HI> xlv. 15. 15. and <HI>P&s;alm</HI> lxxii. from the 9th to the end of the 15th ver&s;e, have their ac|compli&s;hment.</P>
<P>Again&s;t what has been brought to view, particularly in the &s;everal quotations from the P&s;alms, ari&s;es this objec|tion, that the apo&s;tle appears to apply &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages to tho&s;e gathered by the go&s;pel from the among the Gentiles; not to the Gentiles in &s;o exten&s;ive a manner as is expre&s;&s;ed in the P&s;alms; and &s;o tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are to be under&s;tood in the limited &s;en&s;e u&s;ed by the apo&s;tles, who direct their epi&s;tles to the believers of their te&s;timony, collected from among the Gentiles.</P>
<P>To this it may be an&s;wered, that the epi&s;tles of the apo&s;tles were wrote to vi&s;ible churches, and vi&s;ible believers, for their expre&s;s direction in their conduct towards God and one another, and are left on record for the &s;ame end, to all believers in all ages, as none but &s;uch as are led to the

knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, were capable of under&s;tanding the grace there made manife&s;t, and the obligations thence ari&s;ing to glorify him in their &s;pirits and bodies which are his; but yet it is evident they were de&s;igned as a means of communication of the knowledge of Chri&s;t to mankind in general. See <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> i. 9. 10.</P>
<P><HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> ii. 4 to 7. "But God who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he hath loved us, even when we were dead in &s;ins, hath quickened us together with Chri&s;t, and hath rai&s;ed us up together and made us &s;it to|gether in heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us." For what end? "I hat in the ages to come, he might &s;hew the exceeding riches of his grace in kindne&s;s towards us, through Chri&s;t Je&s;us." And in the 3d chapter, from the 2d ver&s;e&punc; we have the end of the di&s;pen&s;ation of grace, given to the a|po&s;tle towards the Ephe&s;ians, "how that by revelation he made known unto me the mi&s;tery, which in other ages was not made known unto the &s;ons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apo&s;tles and prophets by the &s;pirit, that the Gentiles &s;hould be fellow heirs, and of the &s;ame body, and partakers of his promi&s;e in Chri&s;t by the go&s;|pel; unto me, who am le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all &s;aints, is this grace given that I &s;hould preach among the Gentiles the un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t, and to make ALL MEN &s;ee what the fellow&s;hip of the mi&s;tery, which from the be|ginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Je&s;us Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>Here we have glad tidings to ALL MEN; to ages to come; to all things in heaven and earth, in what divine grace did for, and among the apo&s;tles and Ephe&s;ians. The 5th of <HI>Romans,</HI> from the 14th to the end and 1st of <HI>Corin|thians,</HI> v. 15. 19. &s;hew the &s;ame thing, but have been al|ready mentioned and need not be repeated.</P>
<P>Thus the &s;econd enquiry has been attended to, <ABBR><HI>Viz.</HI></ABBR> How doth marriage convey as in a mi&s;tery, the union of Chri&s;t and the church?</P>
<P>From what has been brought to view, we &s;ee the obliga|tions tho&s;e are under, that are brought to the faith of the go&s;pel, to collect together in the profe&s;&s;ion of his name, and

&s;ubjection to his authority, after the example of the fir&s;t di&s;ciples in the fir&s;t churches, to the &s;ame end, which will, I conceive, be the duty of the di&s;ciples till the &s;econd com|ing of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or till all things are put under his feet; till which time, he will u&s;e the &s;ame means to the &s;ame end. Much might be &s;aid here, "but except the Lord build the hou&s;e, they labour in vain that build it."</P>
<P>And not only their obligations to &s;tand forth in the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of his name, ob&s;erving the order of the go&s;pel, as practi&s;ed by the fir&s;t churches, but their obligations to an attention to all the precepts of the new te&s;tament, con|cerning their conduct in every relation they &s;u&s;tain; par|ticularly that of hu&s;band and wife, which the apo&s;tle has in view in the pa&s;&s;age before us, beginning with the wives, ver&s;e 22. "Wives &s;ubmit your&s;elves unto your own hu&s;|bands, as unto the Lord." <HI>Col.</HI> iii. 18. "as it is fit in the Lord." <HI>Titus</HI> ii. 4. "That they may teach the young women to be &s;ober, to love their hu&s;bands, to love their children, di&s;creet, cha&s;te, keepers at home, good, obedient to their hu&s;bands, that the name of God and his doctrine be not bla&s;phemed." 1&s;t of <HI>Peter.</HI> iii. to the end of the 6th ver&s;e, "Likewi&s;e ye wives in &s;ubjection to your own hu&s;bands; that if any obey not the word, they al&s;o may without the word, be won by the conver&s;ation of the wives, while they behold your cha&s;te conver&s;ation, coupled with fear."</P>
<P>In the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, the duty of the wives is made plain; inculcated and enforced from the obligations to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, "as unto the Lord, as it is fit in the Lord;" which &s;hews the duty of the wi&s;e to flow from the authority of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to be directed by his will: So that in all her attention and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to her hu&s;band, the autho|rity and directions of Je&s;us Chri&s;t are ever to be kept in view, as the fir&s;t motive the apo&s;tle u&s;es, and truly it is no barren one, but full of excitation. The believing wife may thus think with her&s;elf, While I am attending my duty to my hu&s;band, the ever ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, in his adorable con|de&s;cen&s;ion, is plea&s;ed to accept me as attending to him: Therefore, as to the Lord, will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in her mind, and excite to ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ulne&s;s therein.

be a di&s;tinct one, is, "that the name of God and his doc|trine be not bla&s;phemed." <HI>Titus</HI> ii. 4. 5. "That they," the aged women, "may teach the young women to be &s;ober, to love their hu&s;bands, to love their children."&mdash;Wives are not only taught &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their hu&s;bands from a &s;en&s;e of duty, but "to love their hu&s;bands, to love their children;" which will excite them, from inward af|fection, ever to be &s;tudying and pur&s;uing their comfort and happine&s;s, while their own is increa&s;ed by the comfort of love: And when to the motive, "as unto the Lord," is joined the "love of hu&s;bands and children, good, obe|dient to their own hu&s;bands, that the name of God and his doctrine be not bla&s;phemed," will follow; will fol|low, did I &s;ay! is it not in&s;eparably interwoven? O my Je&s;us! is thy name and doctrine concerned in my love and duty to my hu&s;band and children; how happy ha&s;t thou made me, in making love, which is my happine&s;s, my duty; and bringing thy name and doctrine to my continual view; may it never be bla&s;phemed by my evil conduct towards my hu&s;band and children; methought I moved in a low &s;phere in attending daily to them, but now I find I'm ex|alted to wait on my Lord; he has been plea&s;ed to com|mit his name and doctrine to my daily care: Angels hath not higher employment than is appointed me, in the very place where he hath placed me; and when I dwell in love, I dwell in him. The third motive, "that if any obey not the word, they al&s;o may, without the word, be won by the conver&s;ation of the wives, while they behold your cha&s;te conver&s;ation with fear," mu&s;t al&s;o be a powerful one, in the minds of believing wives, to an attention to the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corrupt|able, of a meek and quiet &s;pirit, which is in the &s;ight of God of great price. If by the hidden man of the heart&punc; we under&s;tand Chri&s;t dwelling in the hearts of believers by faith, we are led to that which is not corruptable, and to the pattern, fountain, and foundation of a meek and quiet &s;pirit, which indeed, in the &s;ight of God, is of great price. In <HI>Matthew</HI> xi. 29. Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ays, "Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly, and ye &s;hall &s;ind re&s;t to your &s;ouls."
<PB N="19" REF="018214_0018_0FA5C1B6B8269A70">
The believing wives under&s;tand Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be the green olive tree from whence this fruit is found. So did their examples in the old time; "The holy women who tru&s;t|ed in God, and thus adorned them&s;elves, being in &s;ubjec|tion to their own hu&s;bands, even as Sarah obeyed Abra|ham, calling him Lord, who&s;e daughters ye are as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement." What doth that import? So long as you are influenced by your duty to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to attend your duty as wives, you appear to be the children, the followers, or imitators of the holy women who tru&s;ted in God; to belong to that family; and need not be afraid with any amazement; for if our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God. But if in&s;tead of attention to the directions of the apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t, there is giving heed to temptation, not contented in "mode&s;t apparel, with &s;hamefacedne&s;s and &s;o|briety," but giving way to a prevailing &s;olicitude for "the outward adorning of plating the hair," and of "wearing of gold, pearls and co&s;tly array," you will appear to be un|der the influence of your lu&s;ts; to be walking according to the cour&s;e of this world; according to the prince of the power of the air, the &s;pirit that now worketh in the chil|dren of di&s;obedience; and the tendency of it will be to darkne&s;s and fear with amazement, more e&s;pecially at times when there is mo&s;t need of con&s;olation. It certainly doth not become women profe&s;&s;ing godline&s;s, to be thus adorn|ed; but it becometh them to be adorned with good works. Certainly there appears ability for the good works of the go&s;pel; &s;uch as feeding the hungry and cloathing the nak|ed, at lea&s;t as far as the price of the gold, pearls and co&s;tly array beyond mode&s;t apparel, that they wear; when the wearing it can be of no u&s;e, except evidencing their inat|tention to the &s;cripture, which prohibit their wearing it; or what is wor&s;e, oppo&s;ition to them. In which ca&s;e they may be advi&s;ed to read <HI>James</HI> v. 1. 2. 3. with &s;ober atten|tion, which will &s;hew &s;uch a conduct to tend to fear with amazement; which Chri&s;tian women ought to turn from; to walk in love to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to their hu&s;bands and chil|dren, according to the directions of the apo&s;tles of Je&s;us

Chri&s;t, which tends to ca&s;t out the fear that has torment. Ver&s;e 24. "Therfore, as the church is &s;ubject to Chri&s;t, &s;o let the wives to their own hu&s;bands, in every thing." Which &s;hews the duty of wives to &s;ubmit to and &s;eek to plea&s;e their hu&s;bands, in every thing that is not contrary to the mind of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, "as it is fit in the Lord." When the wife makes this the rule of her conduct, &s;he pur&s;ues her own hap|pine&s;s in connection with her hu&s;band's. When his will is contrary to the mind of Chri&s;t, or would wi&s;h his wife to do that &s;he is afraid will incur his di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;he is then only to point out her rea&s;ons from the word, and to per&s;e|vere in attention to the will of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But when &s;he &s;ets up her own will in oppo&s;ition to her hu&s;band, and glo|ries in a victory over him, however &s;he may &s;eem to gratify her&s;elf, &s;he will find it leads to future &s;hame, and fear with amazement.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o, in the pa&s;&s;age before us, ver&s;e 25. "Hu&s;|bands love your wives, even as Chri&s;t al&s;o loved the church, and gave him&s;elf for it," &amp;c. Ver&s;e 28. 29. and 30. "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies; he that loveth his wife loveth him&s;elf: For no man ever yet hated his own fle&s;h, but nouri&s;heth and cheri&s;heth it, even as the Lord the church. For we are members of his body, of his fle&s;h, and of his bones." From this pa&s;&s;age, to|gether with <HI>Collo&s;ians</HI> iii. 19. and 1&s;t of <HI>Peter,</HI> iii. 7. we may collect the mind of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as &s;ignified by the apo&s;tles, concerning the duty of hu&s;bands. 'Tis compre|hended in love. "Hu&s;bands love your wives." Love is the fulfiling of the law, and the rule or mea&s;ure of the love of the hu&s;band to the wife, is, "as Chri&s;t loved the church, and gave him&s;elf for it, that he might &s;anctify and clean&s;e it, with the wa&s;hing of water by the word; that he might make<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the former tran&s;lation.</NOTE> it to him&s;elf a glorious church, not having &s;pot or wrinkle, or any &s;uch thing, but that it &s;hould be holy and without blemi&s;h."</P>
<P>"Je&s;us Chri&s;t loved the church, and gave him&s;elf for it." "Hu&s;bands love your wives, even as Chri&s;t loved the church." Did Je&s;us Chri&s;t give him&s;elf; and am I or have
<PB N="21" REF="018214_0020_0FA5C1B7F4157B18">
I any thing that is for the comfort and happine&s;s of my wife, that through covetou&s;ne&s;s or &s;elf-will I may with|hold from her, and yet manife&s;t I love her as Chri&s;t loved the church? Je&s;us Chri&s;t paid the church's debt, re|deemed her from captivity, directed her in her duty, &s;up|plied her wants, knows how to have compa&s;&s;ion on the ig|norant, and them that are out of the way: He took her circum&s;tances of want, di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery, upon him&s;elf, and communicates of his fullne&s;s unto her; "is of God made to us wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and re|demption;" and is in all an example to direct the love of the hu&s;band to his wife; that he attend to all her wants, di&s;tre&s;&s;es and mi&s;eries; to relieve and &s;upply them accord|ing to his mea&s;ure. And when any thing appears in the conduct of the wife incon&s;i&s;tent with her duty, as the hu&s;|band is the head of the wife, he is to point out her duty from the word. "Je&s;us Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf for the church, that he might &s;anctity and clean&s;e it, with the wa&s;hing of water by the word." If the word be made u&s;e of in the exerci&s;e of love, the tendency and efficacy would be to heal, as it would always bring Chri&s;t's authority to the view of the wife, and keep his example in the view of the hu&s;|band, and guard again&s;t the evil cautioned in <HI>Collo&s;ians</HI> iii. 19. "hu&s;bands love your wives, and be not bitter again&s;t them." Remember that bitterne&s;s always &s;prings from the root of bitterne&s;s; "the root that beareth gall and wormword, from the turning away from the root of the righteous, that beareth fruit." Yet &s;o great is the deceit|fulne&s;s of our own hearts, and &s;o imperceptible the preva|lence of the enemy, transformed into an angel of light, that this bitterne&s;s may appear to &s;pring from a &s;ort of re|ligious ignorance, or a mi&s;taken religious Zeal.</P>
<P>When we read, "that the hu&s;band is the head of the wife," and that it is his duty to rule well his own hou&s;e, a &s;trange notion of head&s;hip and rule may take place, that upon every &s;light occa&s;ion there is a bitter re&s;olution; I will be ma&s;ter of my own hou&s;e; I will be minded; it is my duty, &amp;c. That in&s;tead of viewing the head as the &s;eat of wi&s;dom, care and tenderne&s;s, it is viewed as the
<PB N="22" REF="018214_0021_0FA5C1B8D37E0550">
&s;eat of domineering; as if its only care was to &s;ee, that my will may be done; and perhaps for no fault, only that a particular humour is not plea&s;ed, there will be a &s;tamp on the floor, enough to make all ring again, and the hu&s;|band hold him&s;elf not guilty, from a religious zeal to be minded to rule his own hou&s;e. If I find out the man, can he be offended if I &s;hould inquire, Dear &s;ir, where find you this in the example of Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>From this cau&s;e often proceeds &s;uch di&s;content with that which the indu&s;trious wife has endeavoured to pre|pare, with as much agreeablene&s;s to her hu&s;band, as the means he had put into her hands was capable of; that he will de&s;pi&s;e both it and her; and in&s;tead of coming with gratitude, thank&s;giving and &s;atisfaction to his meals, as that which &s;hews his increa&s;ing and perpetual obligation to eat, drink, and do all to the glory of God, there will be bitter unnea&s;ine&s;s through the whole of the time calcu|lated for family enjoyment and happine&s;s. If there be &s;uch a man, &s;hall I put him in mind, that when Je&s;us fed the multitude with barley bread and fi&s;h, he gave thanks; and when Paul and tho&s;e with him on board the &s;hip, were about to eat, "he took bread and gave thanks to God, in pre&s;ence of them all, and when he had broken, he began to eat; then were they all of good chear, and they al&s;o took meat." Dear &s;ir, thank&s;giving to God, and all of good chear, becomes a Chri&s;tan's table, which the head of the family is to lead in:* Every thing contrary comes from the root of bitter|terne&s;s, however di&s;ordered the head may be, &s;o as not to &s;ee whence it is. The caution, "be not bitter again&s;t them," is to be attended to through the whole of the conduct of the hu&s;band to the wife, with whom he is to "dwell ac|cording to knowledge." The above de&s;cribed conduct mu&s;t flow from ignorance and blindne&s;s, from the God of this world blinding the mind, though it be with a religious zeal for his own honor as the head of the wife, while the honor that is to be given to the wife as the weaker ve&s;&s;el, as his own fle&s;h, as now, "bone of his bone, and fle&s;h of his fle&s;h, as heirs together of the grace of
<PB N="23" REF="018214_0022_0FA5C1B9C03C5938">
life," is not attended to, and their mutual prayers are here|by hindered.</P>
<P>I have been the longer on this, becau&s;e this evil may proceed from ignorance, and the temptation in it not di&s;co|vered, which, when brought to light, may be the &s;ooner turned from; for certainly, if a man find a pronene&s;s to the&s;e or the like evils, in his temper, it will be natural to &s;eek a hiding place, to excu&s;e and ju&s;tify him&s;elf, and no where can he find one more ea&s;y, than under a cloak of fal&s;e religion. But when the true cau&s;e or &s;ource is di&s;covered to him&s;elf, he mu&s;t conclude, that it is more agreeable to his duty, when he finds a legal, fretful, froward di&s;po&s;ition working in him, only waiting an opportunity of breaking forth, to get alone, and take &s;hame to him&s;elf, before him to whom all things are naked and open, who is "the great High Prie&s;t that is pa&s;&s;ed into the heavens, Je&s;us the &s;on of God, touched with the feeling of our infirmities, in all points tempted as we are, without &s;in," and take encouragement from him, "to a&s;k mercy, and find grace to help, in time of need," and take his example with him into his family; who &s;ays, "learn of me, for I am meek an lowly." Whence proceeds a go&s;pel di&s;po&s;ition, which is meek and quiet.</P>
<P>Now then, if there be any in this honorable relation, "HEAD OF THE WIFE, EVEN AS CHRIST IS HEAD OF THE CHURCH," who with their mouths &s;hew much love to "the grace of God that bringeth &s;alvation to all men that hath appeared," who are &s;o far from &s;oberly at|tending to its teaching "to deny ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, and to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly, looking for the ble&s;&s;ed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour, Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who gave him|&s;elf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify us unto him&s;elf a peculiar people zealous of good works," that they give them&s;elves over to ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, in &s;uch a manner, as to neglect their bu&s;ine&s;s, their means of providing for the temporal &s;alvation and comfort of their families for idle company, and gaim|ing, till pinched with want, they are fretful and profane
<PB N="24" REF="018214_0023_0FA5C1BD8795D560">
in their families, to a degree, that would be a &s;candel to heathens, where by the name of God and his doctrines are bla&s;phemed. I dare to appeal to their con&s;ciences, upon &s;ober reflection (which they mu&s;t come to, whether they will or no) whether their hearts don't die within them and become as a &s;tone.</P>
<P>I was looking in my own mind, whether there were not a deception &s;ome how attending the temptations, by which the&s;e per&s;ons are carried away. Perhaps they will &s;ay, they thank God they are not as other men,&mdash;worldly, covetous, afraid of &s;pending a little time or a little money; for their part they don't de&s;ire to have their hearts over-charged with cares of this life, &amp;c. But do they not &s;ee, that this very practice involves them and their families in the utmo&s;t perplexity? What, though they may &s;ometimes appear to gain, hath not divine truth &s;aid, "wealth gotten by vanity &s;hall be dimini&s;hed"? Yes, it &s;hall. Divine power is en|gaged in the cau&s;e of divine truth, and it &s;hall be accompli&s;h|ed. Perhaps in this very in&s;tance in which you gain, it is fulfiled re&s;pecting &s;ome other family.</P>
<P>When Je&s;us Chri&s;t exhorted his di&s;ciples. "Take heed lea&s;t your hearts be over charged with &s;urfeiting and drunk|enne&s;s, and cares of this life, and that day come upon you unawares," did he not give an example of diligence in work|ing the work of him that &s;ent him? Says he, "my meat is to do the will of him that &s;ent me, and to fini&s;h his work." Is it not the character of his &s;pou&s;e? "She worketh wil|lingly with her hands, &s;he looketh well to the ways of her hou&s;hold, and eateth not the bread of idlene&s;s." And doth not his apo&s;tles direct his di&s;ciples, 1&s;t of <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> iv. 11. 12. "That ye &s;tudy to be quiet and do your own bu&s;ine&s;s, and work with your own hands, that ye may walk hone&s;tly towards them that are without, and ye may have lack of nothing." 2d of <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> iii. 11. 12. "We hear that there are &s;ome that walk di&s;orderly, work|ing not at all, but are bu&s;y bodies; now them that are &s;uch, we command and exhort, by our LORD JESUS, that with quietne&s;s they work and eat their own bread." <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> iv. 28. "Rather let him labour, working with
<PB N="25" REF="018214_0024_0FA5C1BF4B84A778">
his hands the thing that is good, that he might have to give to him that needeth." In this the apo&s;tle was an ex|ample, 1&s;t of <HI>The&s;&s;aionians,</HI> ii. 9. "For labouring night and day, becau&s;e we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the go&s;pel of God." <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 34. 35. "The&s;e hands have mini&s;tered to my nece&s;&s;ities, and to them that were with me: So labouring, ye ought to &s;upport the weak, and to remember the words of our Lord Je&s;us, how he &s;aid it is more ble&s;&s;ed to give than to receive."</P>
<P>Let the&s;e &s;ayings &s;ink down into our ears, and let us remember the exhortation, <HI>Romans</HI> xiii. 13. 14. "Let us walk hone&s;tly as in the day, not in rioting and drunken|ne&s;s, not in chambering and wantonne&s;s, not in &s;trife and envy, but put ye on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and make not provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h, to fulfill the lu&s;ts thereof." 'Tis all day with him; we are naked and open before him; "If I &s;ay the darkne&s;s &s;hall cover me, even the night &s;hall be light about me; yea, the darkne&s;s hideth not from thee, but the night &s;hineth as the day; the darkne&s;s and the light are both alike to thee."</P>
<P>As the duty of hu&s;band is now in view, I would take a little more particular notice of the apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI>'s compre|hen&s;ive addre&s;s to them, all contained in one ver&s;e, 1&s;t epi&s;tle, iii. 7. "Likewi&s;e ye hu&s;bands dwell with them ac|cording to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife as to the weaker ve&s;&s;el, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered."</P>
<P>"Dwell with them according to knowledge." This may import the knowledge of the mi&s;tery contained in the marriage union; as it is a figure of the union of Chri&s;t and the church, the knowledge of the love, care, compa&s;|&s;ion and tenderne&s;s, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hews to his church, as an example to the hu&s;band, and of what his word and the nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e of the marriage union binds upon them."</P>
<P>"Giving honor to the wi&s;e as to the weaker ve&s;&s;el." The apo&s;tle &s;ays, "If one member &s;uffer, all the members &s;uffer with it; and if one member be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, all the mem|bers rejoice with it." 'Tis true here, if the head and hu&s;|band give honor to the wi&s;e, all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ible parts of the fa|mily
<PB N="26" REF="018214_0025_0FA5C1BF70FA8360">
rejoice; if &s;he frequently, and without cau&s;e, &s;uffer his di&s;plea&s;ure, all the family &s;uffer herein. But how may I under&s;tand this expre&s;&s;ion, "honor as to the weaker ve&s;|&s;el"? When I look into the hou&s;e, I &s;ee the weaker ve&s;&s;els, the gla&s;s, the china, honored with the mo&s;t attention, the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t honorable place a&s;&s;igned to them; they are handled with the greate&s;t care and tenderne&s;s; and in <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xxii. from the 15th, I read, that when Shebna, who looked upon him&s;elf as the nail fa&s;tened in the &s;ure place, &s;hould be removed, cut down and fall, and the burden on it broken, God would fa&s;ten Eliakim as a type of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a nail in a &s;ure place; "And they &s;hall hang on him all the glory of his Father's hou&s;e, all ve&s;&s;els of &s;mall quantity, from the ve&s;&s;els of cups, even to all the ve&s;&s;els of flaggons." Here is honor to the weaker ve&s;&s;els. Hence the honor to the wife, denotes the care and tenderne&s;s with which &s;he is to be treated; and in all her fears, di&s;tre&s;&s;es and perplexities, to be put in mind of the nail in the &s;ure place, that can never be cut down and fall.</P>
<P>This is agreeable to what follows: "And as being heirs together of the grace of life." The grace of life, is the grace that reigns through righteou&s;ne&s;s to eternal life, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord; which comes not by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done, but according to his mercy. The idea of heir&s;hip, is the idea of inheriting what was not our own, by the will of another. Heirs to|gether of the grace of life, carries the mutual obligation that the grace of the go&s;pel brings us under, to obedience to him in our mutual duties one to another.</P>
<P>"That your prayers be not hindered." The direction, 1&s;t of <HI>Peter,</HI> iv. 7. "Be ye therefore &s;ober, and watch un|to prayer," together with the repeated exhortations of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, to watch and pray, &s;hews the duty of watch|fulne&s;s again&s;t every thing whereby our prayers may be hindered; and as Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in <HI>Mark</HI> xi. 52. &s;ays, "When ye &s;tand praying, forgive, if ye have ought again&s;t any," we may ea&s;ily &s;ee that the contrary &s;pirit mu&s;t hinder mu|tual prayer; for where envy and &s;tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e is, there is confu&s;ion and every evil work. That your prayers be not hinder|ed,
<PB N="27" REF="018214_0026_0FA5C1C05108F258">
may have reference to mutual prayer in the church, which ought to be attended in the exerci&s;e of fervent charity, and which may be marred, weakened or broken, by an indulged carriage, unbecoming the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; in which ca&s;e the direction of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, "If thou bring thy gift to the alter, and there remember that thy brother hath ought again&s;t thee, leave there thy gift before the al|ter, and go thy way, fir&s;t be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift," ought to be attended to.&mdash;It may al&s;o have reference to their mutual prayers in the family, as their circum&s;tances, opportunity and &s;en&s;e of divine mercy, may call them thereunto: For we have di|rection to pray with all prayer and &s;upplication in the &s;pirit; and in every thing, by prayer and &s;upplication, with thank&s;giving, to be making our reque&s;ts known to God; and it mu&s;t be the mutual duties of hu&s;bands and wives, to guard again&s;t that conduct which would hinder the mutual enjoyment of &s;uch a privilege.</P>
<P>In what has been brought to view, the &s;criptures, in their mo&s;t obvious meaning, have been attended to, as knowing they come with the authority of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is Lord of all. The authority of the apo&s;tles is the authority of Chri&s;t, as he has connected them with him|&s;elf; &s;o that he that de&s;pi&s;es the&s;e their exhortations, de|&s;pi&s;eth not man, but God. And &s;ure I am, that an atten|tion to them, is the &s;ure&s;t way to dome&s;tic happine&s;s. I have often thought, that if two per&s;ons come together in the relation of hu&s;band and wife, that wi&s;hed to live hap|pily in that relation, they could walk by no better rules, even &s;uppo&s;ing they did not believe the &s;criptures; but in that ca&s;e they would have but the body or the letter, with|out the &s;pirit. The honor, the nearne&s;s, the endeared af|fection, and the obligations mutually ari&s;ing in that rela|tion, cannot be fully &s;een but as they center in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in his union with, love to, and care of, his church; in whom the man is not without the woman, nor the woman without the man: "For OF HIM, and TO HIM, and THROUGH HIM, are all things:" To whom be glory forever. AMEN.</P>

<P>WHEN the head of a family retiring from his bu&s;ine&s;s to his meals, has the happine&s;s to make them all &s;et down around him and the example of Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tle, to direct, excite, embolden, and encourage him to give thanks before them all, if his mind is led to under&s;tand the glory of the go&s;pel, what can hin|der his breaking forth into prai&s;e, for all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings in heavenly things, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, as they are brought to his view in the bounties of providence on his table; yea, though it be at a time of poverty, and there be only bread and water, to pre&s;erve life till &s;ome further provi&s;ions can be procured, yet even that would point us to the bread and water of life, for even they were made by him, and for him, and do &s;ilently, eminently and con&s;tantly hold forth his glory; if with them I have a piece of a broiled fi&s;h, &s;hall I be di&s;content becau&s;e I have no more, and &s;eem as if the meal was not large enough to call me to thank&s;giv|ing; or &s;hall I not rather remember it is the &s;ame with which Je&s;us fed the multitudes after he had given thanks; the &s;ame that was laid on the coals, <HI>John</HI> xxi. 9. to which he called his di&s;ciples to "come and dine," ver&s;e 12; or would my di&s;contented mind find fault with my bread, becau&s;e I can't obtain every day the fine&s;t of the wheat, let it rather remind me, that it was barley bread with which
<PB N="31" REF="018214_0030_0FA5C1C39CCE30F8">
Je&s;us fed the multitude, <HI>John</HI> vi 9. If the adver&s;ary, who&s;e name is legion, for they are many, attempt like the Midi|anites that typified them, <HI>Judges</HI> vi. to de&s;troy the increa&s;e of the earth, by introducing murmuring, di&s;|content and unea&s;ine&s;s, in&s;tead of thank&s;giving at my table, may this barley bread with which the multitudes were fed, remind me of what the barley cake did, in the ho&s;t of the Midianites, and be as officacious to take away my murmuring; for will it not pierce my heart with grief and &s;hame that I &s;hould murmur at that for which my Lord gives thanks! Can I have the lea&s;t appearance of a &s;ervant or di&s;ciple, to be thus above my ma&s;ter and Lord, while a "perfect di&s;ciple &s;hall be as his ma&s;ter." <HI>Luke</HI> vi. 40. "Herein is the love perfect in us, that we &s;hould have boldne&s;s in the day of judgment, for as he is, &s;o are we in this world." 1&s;t of <HI>John,</HI> iv. 17. Methinks here is al&s;o a further le&s;&s;on for me; when a lad had only five barley loaves, and two &s;mall fi&s;hes, they were all at the &s;ervice of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, of whom and for whom he had them. If I am favoured with meat, it is calculated to lead me to the meat that endureth to eternal life, which the Son of man &s;hall give, who &s;ays, "my fle&s;h is meat indeed." If I have a dinner of herbs, and the &s;en&s;e of di|vine love exciting me and my family to love one another, 'tis better than a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ox, and hatred to my God and family therewith: Shocking the thought! that my un|grateful heart is capable of this! If I ca&s;t my eye on the &s;alt, while I reach after it, it would &s;ilently remind me of the favour of the knowledge of Chri&s;t, made manife&s;t by his apo&s;tles in every p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ace, "which is the &s;alt of the covenant of God that never &s;hould be lacking," typified by that which was to accompany all the offerings of the children of I&s;rael, and which was given them in Ezra's time, by Darius, chap. vi. 9. and by Artaxerxes, chap. vii. 22. at the commandment of the prie&s;t, without pre&s;cribing, pointing forward to the favour of the knowledge of Chri&s;t, which my &s;alt would remind me of: This turns my mind to an in&s;truc|tion we have in <HI>Ezra</HI> iv. 14. "Now becau&s;e we are &s;alted with the &s;alt of the palace, it was not meet for us to &s;ee

Is my table furni&s;hed, and am I favoured with roots, and will they not turn my mind to the "root of Je&s;&s;e," <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xi. 10. "the root out of a ory ground," chap. liii. 2. "the root of the righteous that yieldeth or giveth," <HI>Proverbs</HI> xii. 12. For my roots were by him, they are from him and for him, to hold forth his glory. Do I find my table enrich'd with fruits, the fruit of the vine; have I a cup of wine there, &s;urely it &s;o fully points to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that as oft as I drink it, I ought to remember him, whether it be at the Lord's &s;upper, or at my own table.

<P><PB N="33" REF="018214_0032_0FA5C1C98FAB7D68">
"I AM that I AM, I am the God of Abraham, of I&s;aac, and of Jacob; this is my name forever, and my memorial throughout all generations: I know the &s;orrows of their po&s;terity, therefore I am come down to deliver them."&mdash;And is there not in this name and memorial joy to the whole earth? Is he the God of the Jews only, and not of the Gen|tiles al&s;o? Yes, "even of the Gentiles al&s;o; the God of the whole earth &s;hall he be called." The promi&s;e to Abra|ham is. "In thy &s;eed &s;hall all the nations of the earth be ble&s;&s;ed." So that there is not held forth to Mo&s;es in the burning bu&s;h, the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of the children of I&s;rael and their deliverance only, but of the whole human race, who by the cur&s;e of the fiery law, appeared in danger of being burnt up without remedy; but Je&s;us "was made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law;" he &s;u&s;tained the fire, and freed us from being con&s;umed. His &s;u&s;taining of, and deliverance from it, was the beginning of revenges on the enemy; on which the call is, "Rejoice O ye nations, his people." In view of which, in the lxviith <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> "All people" are called to "clap their hands, and &s;hout with the voice of triumph; for the Lord, High and Terrible, a Great King over all the earth, he hath &s;ubdued the people under us, and the nations under our feet." The nation and people of the Jews, apprehend|ed them&s;elves above the Gentiles, and de&s;pi&s;ed them; but &s;ince "God is gone up with a &s;hout, the Lord with the &s;ound of the trumpet," it is evident he hath cho&s;en our inheritance for us, "the excellency of Jacob, whom he loved."</P>
<P>Our inheritance: All people, the Gentiles, who are fellow heirs, and of the &s;ame body, and partakers of his promi&s;es in Chri&s;t by the go&s;pel, and all people, are called on, "Sing prai&s;es to God; &s;ing prai&s;es; &s;ing prai&s;es unto our King, &s;ing prai&s;es; for God is King of all the earth; &s;ing ye prai&s;es that have under&s;tanding: God reigneth over the heathen; God &s;iteth upon his holy throne."&mdash;Agreeable to <HI>P&s;alm</HI> ii. where it is &s;aid, "Yet have I &s;et my King upon my holy hill of Zion: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee," (referring to the re&s;urrection) "a&s;k of me, and I will give the heathen thine inheritance, and the utmo&s;t parts of the earth thy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion." Upon
<PB N="34" REF="018214_0033_0FA5C1CB58D1CE38">
his re&s;urrection, 'tis manife&s;t they are his purcha&s;ed po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. This King now manife&s;tly appears to reign in righteou&s;ne&s;s: "I have &s;et my King upon my holy hill of Zion." So in the above xlviith <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> on his a&s;cen&s;ion, he is "King of all the earth," he "rigneth over the heathen," he "&s;itteth on his holy throne," he is come who&s;e right it is; thus "the princes of the people are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham;" he not only &s;hielded Abraham's family in their affliction, but "the &s;hields of the earth belong unto the Lord; he is greatly exalted."</P>
<P>Is there not a le&s;&s;on for me, under my di&s;tre&s;&s;ing trials, of what &s;ort &s;oever, to realize the reverence and &s;ub|jection that is due to my Lord, as in the ca&s;e of Mo&s;es, <HI>Exodus</HI> iii. 5. and <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> v. 15. re&s;igning my&s;elf up to him as not my own, but redeemed by him? Now this was the manner in I&s;rael, concerning redeeming and changing,&mdash;to e&s;tabli&s;h all things, a man pluck'd off his &s;hoe, and gave it to his neighbour, and this was a &s;ure witne&s;s in I&s;rael that he had re&s;igned his right, and it was the pro|perty of him that redeemed it; which I am of my Lord Redeemer, and ought to realize it with reverend &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, under every affliction, knowing that in his everla&s;ting name, his memorial through all generations, there is a fountain of all-&s;ufficient con&s;olation.</P>
<P>Are not the&s;e things brought to my view in the fruit of the bu&s;h upon my table? And doth not the ri&s;ing and growing of the&s;e bu&s;hes from year to year, bring to my mind the u&s;e my Lord teaches me to make of this mani|fe&s;tation of him&s;elf, in proof of the re&s;urrection, in <HI>Luke</HI> xx. 37. 38? Or, are the above-mentioned beans, pea&s;e and &s;qua&s;hes, with the cucumbers and mellons, on my table, the fruit of the vine, then they all, with the blood of the grapes, point to the true vine from whence they proceed, to whom they belong, and for whom they were created. But have I not yet done? Am I pre&s;ented with the fruit of the apple-tree, to bring to my mind the tree of life, which bear twelve fruits, and yielded her fruit every month; which fruit was for meat, and the leaf for medicine; "the leaves of the tree for the healing of the nations?" If my apple &s;hould remind me of the fruit of the forbidden tree,
<PB N="35" REF="018214_0034_0FA5C1CB85F75800">
by which &s;in and death entered, it will al&s;o lead me to Chri&s;t, by and for whom the apple-tree was created; for "as the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, &s;o is my beloved among the &s;ons." I have all in this tree; for the fruit is for food and the leaf for medicine. What may I under&s;tand by the leaves of the tree, in a natural &s;en&s;e? It &s;hows that which evidences of what &s;ort the tree is: Thus the fig tree was known it had leaves; and as the leaves of a fig-tree were &s;ewed together for aprons, after the fall, to hide nakedne&s;s and &s;hame, as has been the manner ever &s;ince, "to cover with a covering, but not of God's &s;pirit," to go about to e&s;tabli&s;h our own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which covering is too narrow, a man cannot wrap him|&s;elf in it; &s;o when Je&s;us came the Lord our righteou&s;|ne&s;s, he &s;aith to the fig-tree, the emblem of &s;eeking life by our own righteou&s;ne&s;s, "never man eat fruit of thee henceforth forever, and immediately the fig-tree withered away;" but his leaf &s;hall not wither,&mdash;his profe&s;&s;ion.&mdash;The truth he heard of God at this bapti&s;m, "this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed," the truth he taught through his life and mini&s;try, that he witne&s;&s;ed a good confe&s;&s;ion to, before Pontious Pilot, that was wit|ne&s;&s;ed in his re&s;urrection, whereby he is "declared the Son of God, with power according to the &s;pirit of holine&s;s," this truth, which Peter made confe&s;&s;ion of, on which he will build his church, is, I apprehend, what we are led to for the meaning of the "leaves of the tree, that are for the healing of the nations," who&s;e virtues &s;hall prevail 'till "there be no more cur&s;e."</P>
<P>But it is time to ri&s;e from table. Plea&s;e, &s;ir, to &s;top and ta&s;te a few nuts. Yes, my friend, I will ta&s;te them, that they may lead me down to the garden of nuts, of which I read, <HI>Song</HI> vi. 11. to &s;ee the "fruits of the valley;" for val|lies, mountains, rocks, hills and plains, bea&s;ts, and all cat|tle, fruitful trees, and all cedars, creeping things, and fowls of every wing, all in their places &s;hew forth his glory; for all things were created by him and for him: To whom be glory forever.

<P>PARENT and child comprehends more endearing, engaging, and re&s;pectful ideas, than I can conceive, much le&s;s expre&s;s the fullne&s;s of: But when I think of them, they appear as harmonious notes in agreeable mu&s;ick, which may delight the ear of him who cannot give them their proper &s;ound. Notwith&s;tanding, I &s;hall attempt &s;omething that may be u&s;eful in conducting in that endeared relation.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="018214_0036_0FA5C1CCF80C2CD0">
'Tis the place and duty of a child to be in his parents pre&s;ence with reverence and delight; and 'tis the duty of the parent to guard again&s;t a childle&s;s familiarity, that would tend to make the child humour&s;ome, and bring the parent into contempt; and again&s;t &s;uch an au&s;terity as would make their pre&s;ence a dread which the child would &s;eek to avoid. 'Tis their duty al&s;o to guard again&s;t ill names, and &s;uch phra&s;es and expre&s;&s;ions as would intimate to the minds of the children, that their parents have not the fear of God before their eyes. If in&s;tead of the pater|nal, endearing expre&s;&s;ions of&mdash;my dear child, my &s;on, my daughter,&mdash;'tis&mdash;you little our, you dog, you plague,&mdash;or the like; 'tis, what &s;hall I call it! a violent rape on the morals of the child. Such children are early capable of rea&s;oning after this manner,&mdash;if I am &s;uch a creature, what is my father that begat me, or my mother that brought me forth?&mdash;and they &s;oon get emboldened to u&s;e the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions, at lea&s;t to tho&s;e that offend them; which is productive of wrath and &s;trife, and promotes an unde&s;irable hardne&s;s and har&s;hne&s;s of temper and manners.</P>
<P>Parents mu&s;t likewi&s;e guard again&s;t a cu&s;tomary threat|ning, which alienates the mind, and &s;owers the temper of the children, and produces contempt of the parents, when they &s;ee their threatnings are only verbal, never to be feared except when they get into a pa&s;&s;ion. Threatnings ought to be given out with great caution and care; to be what will be the parents indi&s;pen&s;ible duty in the threatned ca&s;e: They ought to be confined to moral evils; &s;uch as ap|parent wil&s;ul di&s;obedience, lying, cheating, or profanene&s;s; any thing that is an apparent &s;in again&s;t God or our neigh|bour: And when judiciou&s;ly given out, they ought to be punctually executed, not in pa&s;&s;ion and anger, but in love and faithfulne&s;s. And when any accidental mi&s;carriage takes place, &s;uch as the breaking an earthen ve&s;&s;el, or a &s;quare of gla&s;s, it &s;hould meet with a gentle admonition, never carried &s;o high as to tempt the children to lie to hide it, for fear of the wrath of their parents.</P>
<P>Here I would take notice of the apo&s;tolick direction, <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> vi. 4. "And ye fathers provoke not your chil|dren
<PB N="38" REF="018214_0037_0FA5C1CE07CF7F18">
to wrath, lea&s;t they be di&s;couraged, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."</P>
<P>"Lea&s;t they be di&s;couraged." Doth it not include in it every thing in the education of children, that would give them a dreadful di&s;couraging idea of God, or of their natural parents, &s;o as to cau&s;e them &s;ecretly to wi&s;h they could hide them&s;elves from him or them, or to make them unhappy at the thought of being always in the Divine pre&s;ence (a &s;ource of &s;ecurity and happine&s;s where his name is known) or at the thought of coming into the pre&s;ence of their parents.</P>
<P>The &s;cripture account that God is love, and the way in which it is made manife&s;t, is calculated to &s;hew our high|e&s;t happine&s;s in his pre&s;ence and favour; and what is to be mo&s;t feared, is that which will di&s;plea&s;e him, and procure his frown. In like manner, if parents conduct by the Divine rule, their children will be happie&s;t in their pre|&s;ence and favour, and it mu&s;t be a great puni&s;hment to be turned away from them, as a token of di&s;plea&s;ure, but for an hour. But when, on the contrary, they cannot come where they are, without &s;ome hard names or dreadful threatnings, they are provoked and di&s;couraged.</P>
<P>"But bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord." Nurture conveys the idea of nur&s;ing or nouri&s;hment, agreeable to 1&s;t of <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> ii. 7. "We were gentle among you, as a nur&s;e cheri&s;heth her chil|dren;" 1&s;t of <HI>Peter,</HI> ii. 2. "As new-born babes de&s;ire the &s;incere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby;" 1&s;t of <HI>Timothy,</HI> iv. 6. "Nouri&s;hed up in the words of faith and good doctrine." Admonition conveys the idea, to coun|&s;el, advi&s;e, in&s;truct, warn and reprove.</P>
<P>The admonition of the Lord, leads my mind to 1&s;t of <HI>Corinthians,</HI> x. 11. where the apo&s;tle, &s;peaking of the things written in the old te&s;tament, &s;ays, "they are written for our admonition." The &s;criptures of the new began to be &s;poken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him&punc; They are the admonition of the Lord; not only the &s;ayings of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, but of his apo&s;tles, that he connects with him&s;elf, "He that heareth you, heareth
<PB N="39" REF="018214_0038_0FA5C1CE77E67878">
me;" are the admonition of the Lord, as is expre&s;&s;ed 1&s;t of <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> ii. 11. "As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father his children, that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you to his kingdom and glory."</P>
<P>1&s;t. For nurture. Let the children have the &s;incere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby; let them &s;uck and be &s;atisfied with the&s;e brea&s;ts of con&s;olation. Only let us look into the various pa&s;&s;ages, in which Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;pake of, to, or about little children: See <HI>Matthew</HI> xviii. 1. to 14. chap. xix. 14. 15. <HI>Matthew</HI> xxi. 16. <HI>Mark</HI> xi. 13. to 16. <HI>Luke</HI> xviii. 14. 16. and &s;ee if there is any thing be&s;ides glad tidings of great joy to them: If it be &s;o, let the dear children know it as &s;oon as they are capable of under&s;tanding; let them be "nouri&s;hed up in the words of faith," in tho&s;e truths that are to be believed, "and good doctrine;" the good news, the glad tidings that the GOSPEL contains. Or is there any threatnings of eter|nal damnation to children, by the apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t? If not, who dare ring them in their ears!</P>
<P>There is indeed, temporal de&s;truction, with the greate&s;t infamy, threatned di&s;obedient children, <HI>Proverbs</HI> xxx. 17. which is a part of the &s;econd branch: The admonition of the Lord &s;o is, <HI>Luke</HI> xv. 15. where the prodigal, from a father's hou&s;e, where is bread enough, and to &s;pare, is brought to be a poor hungry &s;wine-feeder.</P>
<P>So is every caution and warning through the &s;criptures, e&s;pecially the new te&s;tament, which the parents ought to be acquainted with, and bring to the children's view, for warning, reproving, coun&s;eling, advi&s;ing and in&s;tructing on all occa&s;ions, particularly upon any thing that is &s;inful: The divine admonition ought to be brought immediately from the lively oracles, and they convinced it is di&s;agree|able to the will of their Greater, Pre&s;erver and Redeemer, on whom their all depends.</P>
<P>For an example of admonition, we have one drawn to our hands by the apo&s;tle, 1&s;t of <HI>Corinthians</HI> 1. to 11. which being well con&s;idered, may help parents to make u&s;e of other &s;criptures in a &s;imilar way, as there may be occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="018214_0039_0FA5C1CF41D57798">
Thus have I given &s;ome thoughts on the education of children, to whom I wi&s;h the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of an early ac|quaintance with what God has done for them, and their obligations of gratitude to him. 'Tis the duty of parents, from childhood, to acquaint them with the holy &s;criptures, where|in the&s;e things are contained (as Timothy was) "which are able to make wi&s;e unto &s;alvation, through faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us:" 'Tis with him to communicate the know|ledge of him&s;elf, according to his good plea&s;ure: To whom be glory and dominion, forever.

<P>WHEN I meditate on the ca&s;e of children, and propo&s;e an exhortation to them, in&s;tead of being governed by the various opinions there are about them. I would turn to the &s;criptures, and form my apprehen&s;ions from them, that I may know what ground there is for a word of exhortation to them. In <HI>Matthew</HI> xviii. 5. and <HI>Mark</HI> ix. 37. Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ays, "Who&s;oever &s;hall receive one &s;uch little child in my name, receiveth me." One &s;uch;&mdash;it was a child he took in his arms, in <HI>Mark;</HI> a lit|tle child in <HI>Matthew:</HI> And in <HI>Luke</HI> xviii. 15. they brought infants, and Je&s;us &s;aid, "Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of &s;uch is the kingdom
<PB N="42" REF="018214_0041_0FA5C1D223C95C98">
of Heaven." How comes infants con&s;tituted of the king|dom of Heaven? <HI>Matthew</HI> xviii. 11. &s;hews Je&s;us Chri&s;t came to &s;ave them; therefore, "take heed that ye de|&s;pi&s;e not one of the&s;e little ones; for I &s;ay unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my fa|ther which is in heaven; for the &s;on of man is come to &s;ave that which is lo&s;t." Their angels: What is the office of the holy angels? "Are they not all mini&s;tring &s;pirits, &s;ent forth to mini&s;ter for them that &s;hall be heirs of &s;alvation?" If their angels always behold the face of the God and Fa|ther of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is in heaven, doth it not convey the idea that nothing can be done again&s;t them, in a way of de&s;pi&s;ing them, but what mu&s;t be immediately known there? And if angels mini&s;ter to infants, are they not heirs of &s;alvation? How came they heirs; are they not by nature children of wrath; are they not lo&s;t in Adam, their head; how came they heirs of &s;alvation? Ver&s;e 11. informs us, "For the &s;on of man came to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t." Though they are really lo&s;t in union with the fir&s;t Adam, and however they may appear lo&s;t in their own utter helple&s;&s;ne&s;s, and the various di&s;tre&s;&s;es and mi&s;eries, even death it&s;elf, that they are expo&s;ed to; yet if the &s;on of man is come to &s;ave that which is lo&s;t; has taken hold of them, taken their nature into union with him&s;elf, and con&s;tituted them of the kingdom of God, in virtue of his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, who &s;ays, <HI>Luke</HI> xviii. 15. "for of &s;uch is the kingdom of God," then "take heed that ye de&s;pi&s;e not one of the&s;e little ones." Are they not de&s;pi&s;ed by tho&s;e that freely and frequently &s;peak of the everla&s;ting damnation of infants? Do they get it from any word of Je&s;us Chri&s;t concerning them? Why is it &s;o? That they are lo&s;t is readily acknowledged; but the &s;on of man came to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t: Will he not accompli&s;h his de&s;ign; is he not mighty to &s;ave? He is the &s;hepherd that looks after that which is lo&s;t," that "takes the lambs into his arms and carries them in his bo&s;om:" "How think ye, if a man have an hundred &s;heep, if one of them be gone a&s;tray, doth he not leave the ninety-nine, and goeth into the mountains and &s;eeketh that which is gone a&s;tay&punc;
<PB N="43" REF="018214_0042_0FA5C1D24E8F2470">
and if &s;o be that he find it, verily I &s;ay unto you, that he rejoiceth more of that than of the ninety-nine that went not a&s;tray: EVEN &s;o it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven, that one of the&s;e little ones &s;hould peri&s;h." If Je&s;us Chri&s;t came to &s;ave them, and it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of them &s;hould peri&s;h, mu&s;t not the de&s;pi&s;ers of them, that &s;o freely treat of their dam|nation, &s;u&s;pect them&s;elves as advocates for the de&s;troyer? Do they not prevail to draw a vail over the power and compa&s;&s;ion of the Saviour, and de&s;troy the peace of thou|&s;ands?</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to illu&s;trate this, by bringing in the te&s;timony of the prophets and apo&s;tles. When God, by his prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> was comforting ancient I&s;rael in what he would do for them, chap. xxxi. 1. to 14. the ground and rea&s;on of which we have in the 11th ver&s;e, "For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and ran&s;omed him from the hand of &s;tronger than he." Having redeemed and ran&s;omed him, "He that &s;cattered I&s;rael will gather him, and keep him as a &s;hepherd his flock: Therefore they &s;hall come and &s;ing in the height of Zion; and they &s;hall not &s;orrow any more at all; then &s;hall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old men together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and make them re|joice from their &s;orrow, and I will &s;atiate the &s;oul of the prie&s;t with fatne&s;s, and my people &s;hall be &s;atisfied with my goodne&s;s, &s;aith the Lord." That this good news may reach the bottom of their affliction and &s;orrow, expre&s;&s;ed in ver&s;e 15. in a prophetic view, of the de&s;truction of the children of Bethlehem, by Herod, 'tis &s;aid, ver&s;e 16. "Re|frain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears, for thy work &s;hall be rewarded, &s;aith the Lord; and they &s;hall come again from the land of the enemy, and there is hope in thine end, &s;aith the Lord, that thy children &s;hall come again to their own border." Death was the enemy where they went; from which they &s;hall come again, and inherit their own border, in him, or by virtue of union with him, "who through death, de&s;troys him that had the power of death; that is the devil." "Thus &s;aith the Lord,
<PB N="44" REF="018214_0043_0FA5C1D2F12D10C8">
even the captives of the mighty &s;hall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible &s;hall be delivered; for I will con|tend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will &s;ave thy children, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xlix 25." "They &s;hall come again from the land of the enemy."</P>
<P>"And there is hope in thine end that thy children &s;hall come again to their own border." What is their own bor|der? 'Tis the fruit of the purcha&s;e of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, called their own in virtue of their union to him. To this I would add the apo&s;tle Peter, in <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 39. "For the promi&s;e is to you and to your children, and to all that are afar, of even as many as the Lord our God &s;hall call." The promi&s;e to you and your children, as exten&s;ive as the call of the go&s;pel, which is directed to every creature, and expre&s;&s;ed in this language by the prophet, "Look unto me, and be ye &s;aved, all the ends of the earth."</P>
<P>It may not be un&s;uitable to take notice here of the error of many parents, and others, who comfort them&s;elves con|cerning their infant children, when they die, from their in|nocency, &s;aying they are undoubtedly gone to happine&s;s, and rob the Saviour of his glory, and them&s;elves of any true comfort. If they would think a few minutes, if the &s;alva|tion by Je&s;us Chri&s;t is excluded, and they gone to happi|ne&s;s by virtue of their own innocency, 'tis a happine&s;s that they them&s;elves can never be admitted to; "for there is no other name under Heaven among men, whereby they can be &s;aved, but the name of Je&s;us" They &s;eem not to attend to the apo&s;tle; "he hath concluded all under &s;in, that he might have mercy upon all."</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle John, when writing to the di&s;ciples, under the character of little children, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ys, "I write unto you, little children, becau&s;e your &s;in are forgiven, for his name &s;ake: I write unto you, little children, becau&s;e you have known the Father." The Father is not known to any but to whom&s;oever the &s;on will reveal him. When they under&s;tood the forgivne&s;s of &s;ins for his name's &s;ake, the know the father: Thus is he, who is love, made mani|fe&s;t. And this is what little children in Chri&s;t's &s;chool are taught, by an aged apo&s;tle, "I write unto you, little chil|dren,
<PB N="45" REF="018214_0044_0FA5C1D75F6AA210">
becau&s;e your &s;ins are forgiven you, for his name's &s;ake," which he lays in the foundation of his exhorta|tions to them, "Love not the world," &amp;c.</P>
<P>I am aware of an objection again&s;t what I have brought to view. How can the&s;e things be &s;o, when we &s;ee chil|dren, as &s;oon as they grow up, turn after their own lu&s;ts, after "the cour&s;e of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the &s;pirit that now worketh in the children of di&s;obedience?" Do we not &s;ee children and youth &s;oon arrive at a &s;hocking pitch of profanene&s;s and immora|ity? Yes, verily, multitudes of them appear to be in the &s;nare of the devil, and led captive by him, at his will: But who&s;e are they? Do they belong to him who hath in&s;nared them, and leads them captive; yea, though he &s;o blind their minds as to lead them to profane the name of their right|ful owner, and to &s;ay he &s;hall not reign over us, doth it alienate the property of them? May they not be told with truth and propriety, that they are not their own, they be|long to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to whom they mu&s;t give an account of their conduct, who will bring every knee of them to bow to him; that they are working out their own &s;hame and confu&s;ion of face before him? May they not be called to repent; to return to their rightful proprietor, owner and Lord?</P>
<P>But how repent, unle&s;s they are wrong in their aliena|tion to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and in their walking according to the &s;pirit that now worketh in the children of di&s;obedience? How return, if they have not gone a&s;tray; if they belong not to their Lord Redeemer; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he be not the &s;hepherd and bi&s;hop of their &s;ouls? Is not this idea held up in every call to repentance? <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xiiv. 22. "Return, for I have re|deemed thee." <HI>Jeremiah</HI> iii. 12. "Return, thou back-&s;lid|ing I&s;rael, &s;aith the Lord;" 14. "Turn, O back &s;liding children, &s;aith the Lord. for I am married unto you;" 22. "Return, ye back &s;liding children, I will heal your back-&s;lidings." The idea of his right as Redeemer, Hu&s;band and Father, is implied in the call to return, and every ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to re|pentance &s;uppo&s;es mercy: "I here is forgivne&s;s with thee, that thou maye&s;t he feared," and we cannot conceive of

mercy but in a con&s;i&s;tency with ju&s;tice: If ju&s;tice is &s;atisfi|ed, mercy &s;lows without ob&s;truction, "Return, for I have redeemed thee."</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if they are in the &s;nare of the devil, led captive by him at his will, "for this purpo&s;e was the &s;on of man manife&s;t, that he might de&s;troy the works of the devil."&mdash;When the prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> introduces the inquiry, chap. xlix. 24.

"But thus &s;aith the Lord, the captives of the mighty &s;hall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible &s;hall be delivered, for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will &s;ave thy children." He will not leave them in his hands; no, not one of the hundred; the &s;hepherd will not lo&s;e one of the hundred &s;heep; he came to &s;ave that which is lo&s;t; he came to do his Father's will, and it is not his will "that one of the&s;e little ones &s;hould peri&s;h."</P>
<P>Thus much OF CHILDREN; what follows is addre&s;&s;|ed TO CHILDREN.</P>
<P>Children,&mdash;let me a&s;k your attention to what is laid be|fore you, &s;imply from the &s;criptures.&mdash;Are the&s;e things &s;o? If &s;o, methinks it is "glad tidings of great joy," and &s;hews the ground of obligation that lies upon you to look upon your&s;elves as not your own, as not at liberty to walk after your own lu&s;ts, as not belonging to &s;atan, however he may &s;eek to devour or in&s;nare you,&mdash;you be|long to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our Creator, Pre&s;erver and Redeem|er, he has bought you with his blood, and therefore you are under the highe&s;t obligations to "glorify him in your &s;pirits and bodies which are his;" and is it not in this view, mo&s;t ungrateful, ba&s;e and wicked, to walk contrary thereunto? I have thought whether it were not the ig|norance of children about what our Lord and Saviour is to them, has done, and is doing for them, that was the
<PB N="47" REF="018214_0046_0FA5C1D96B5FB6C8">
cau&s;e of their &s;inking &s;o low into the mire and filth of pro|fanene&s;s and immorality; while a &s;en&s;e of love always carries with it, a &s;en&s;e of obligation to grateful obedience: Where this is the ca&s;e, it would be natural to turn our minds to the exhortation of the apo&s;tle to children, "chil|dren obey your parents in the Lord, for this right." When we con&s;ider the wretched, helple&s;s circum&s;tances we come into the world in, and view the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Father of mercies, giving paternal love, tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion to our parents, and by this means, daily loading us with his benefits; as &s;oon as we are capable of reflecting, it mu&s;t give us a view of ob|ligation to gratitude and thankfulne&s;s, which cannot be expre&s;&s;ed, without a &s;en&s;e of obligation to obedience; therefore, children "obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right," it mu&s;t commend it&s;elf to your own con|&s;ciences as right.&mdash;I wi&s;h to unfold &s;omething of the mean|ing of this expre&s;&s;ion; if I could, it would di&s;cover &s;uch obligations as could not be broken through, without do|ing violence to our own con&s;ciences, our peace and com|fort, for it mu&s;t lead to a united view of what our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has done, and is doing for us, and what he makes our parents to us, and does for us by their means, which would lead our minds to all the thought, care, toil and labour of the father, and to the compa&s;&s;ionate tender|ne&s;s of the mother, who often, with much pain and plea|&s;ure, nouri&s;hes her offspring from her own body, both night and day; well might the apo&s;tle &s;ay, "children obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right." Here al&s;o is a direction to children, when they come to years capable of under&s;tanding the will of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us concerning them; if ever the parents, through the preva|lency of temptation, command any thing contrary to his revealed will, to remember the words of the apo&s;tle to the rulers who commanded them contrary to the will of the Lord, "we ought to obey God rather than man," and duti|fully to remind their parents of the rea&s;ons of their con|duct; to obey in any thing contrary to his revealed will, would not be to obey them "in the LORD."</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="018214_0047_0FA5C1D9C0B6F008">
"Honor thy father and mother," which is the fir&s;t commandment, with promi&s;e, "that it may be well with thee, and that thou maye&s;t live long on the earth;" a con|trary conduct, &s;lights the divine authority that commands, and the divine promi&s;e annexed thereto; it &s;lights our own welfare, and forfeits life upon earth. What ba&s;e fol|ly, guilt and &s;hame, doth di&s;obedience to parents carry along with it!</P>
<P>When the apo&s;tle to the Romans, &s;peaks of God's giv|ing over the Gentiles to a reprobace mind, and rehear&s;es what they were filled with which led thereunto, we find in the catalogue. "di&s;obedience to parents," <HI>Romans</HI> i. 30. So when he &s;peaks of the perilous times that &s;hould come in the la&s;t days, one part of the de&s;cription is, "di&s;obedi|ence to parents," 2d. of <HI>Timothy</HI> iii. 2.</P>
<P>This is that which, be&s;ides the ingratitude, ba&s;ene&s;s and wickedne&s;s that appears in it, has a leading tendency, to various others, if not all kinds of vice and wickedne&s;s: Therefore, "children obey your parents in the Lord;" "Honor thy father and mother, that it may be well with thee, that thou maye&s;t live long upon the earth," even till it plea&s;e God in his providence, to call you by a natural death, in his own time and way, and not hurry your&s;elves, by your di&s;obedience, into the hands of civil ju&s;tice, to an untimely death, to which it has a tendency.</P>
<P>When Je&s;us Chri&s;t addre&s;&s;ed his di&s;ciples under the cha|racter of little children, <HI>John</HI> xiii. 33. the exhortation he had to give them, to which he thus called their attention, was, ver&s;e 34, "a new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye al&s;o love one another." This is the duty of every one, more e&s;pecially of all who hope for &s;alvation from the love of the Saviour, which ought to excite children to treat one another with kindne&s;s and love, not to wi&s;h evil to any that offend us, not to "render evil for evil," not to de|&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e that are poor, but endeavour to think of the forgivne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, agreeable to the exhortation of the apo&s;tle, <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> iv. 31. "let all bitterne&s;s, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil
<PB N="49" REF="018214_0048_0FA5C1DAC7857210">
&s;peaking, be put away from you, with all malice, and be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Chri&s;t hath forgiven you."</P>
<P>Here I would take notice of what I have &s;een in &s;ome in&s;tances, with &s;orrow. When young per&s;ons have been intru&s;ted with the care of little children, either at home, or to lead them abroad, they have &s;eemed to lo&s;e all &s;en&s;e of that kindne&s;s and tender-heartedne&s;s, of which the apo&s;tle &s;peaks; and as it were, cruelly divert them&s;elves with tell|ing the dear little ones frightful &s;tories, and giving out many threatnings to them, 'till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear and di&s;tre&s;s has bani&s;h|ed every agreeable feeling from their tender brea&s;ts, and they bur&s;t forth into &s;obbing and crying; for which they have been called cro&s;s,&mdash;twitch'd, &s;colded at, threatned and beaten: Which conduct, in many ca&s;es, has been of very hurtful con&s;equences. How contrary is this to the obligations we are under to walk in love one to another!</P>
<P>There is one con&s;ideration I would &s;ugge&s;t to all that have the care of little children; i. e. what Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;aid, "of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven," and in that remark|able pa&s;&s;age, <HI>Mark</HI> ix. 36. 37. "he took a child and &s;et him in the mid&s;t of them, and when he had taken him in his arms," (ob&s;erve the bigne&s;s of the child, a child in the arms) "he &s;aid unto them, who&s;oever &s;hall receive one of &s;uch children, in my name, receiveth me, and who&s;oever &s;hall receive me, receiveth him that &s;ent me." Would we treat Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the above manner were he upon earth! And will not the above pa&s;&s;ages warrant us to &s;ay that he is now on earth, in the lea&s;t of the&s;e his brethren; &s;o that as ye did unto them ye did unto him; and on re|flection on the above conduct, any of us that have been guilty, on recollecting what we have done when we thought no one &s;aw us, may well be afraid, and &s;ay&mdash;&s;urely God was in the place, and I knew it not.</P>
<P>May the thought ever excite to an attention to the fore|mentioned exhortation, "Let all bitterne&s;s and wrath and anger and clamour and evil &s;peaking, be put away." Evil &s;peaking comes from a little member, but "'tis a fire, a world of iniquity&punc; it &s;ets on fire the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of nature, and
<PB N="50" REF="018214_0049_0FA5C1DC3B769090">
is &s;et on fire of hell," &s;aith the apo&s;tle <HI>James,</HI> iii. 6. It would perhaps be impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the variety into which this fire blazes and unfolds it&s;elf. Without attempt|ing this, I &s;hall ju&s;t take notice of it as it di&s;covers it&s;elf in profanene&s;s, uncleanne&s;s, covetou&s;ne&s;s, &s;tealing and lying.</P>
<P>To begin with profanene&s;s. Can there be any thing more ba&s;e, ungrateful and wicked, than to profane that worthy name, which is above every name, in which there is &s;alvation, the ju&s;t God and the Saviour, Emanuel, God with us. We know not God but as he is thus manife&s;t: So there can be no &s;pecies of profaning that name, but it includes in it the ba&s;e ingratitude of profaning the Saviour. If the con&s;ideration of his being their God, was u&s;ed as an argument again&s;t profanene&s;s with ancient I&s;rael, as <HI>Levi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">us</HI> xix. 12. "neither &s;halt thou profane the name of thy God," certainly the grace manife&s;ted in the go&s;pel hath the &s;ame obligations in it; and opens up a ground of perpe|tual prai&s;e and thank&s;giving: And who of us are not at &s;ome times con&s;trained to acknowledge it; and with our tongues to ble&s;s God, even the Father? Shall we there|with cur&s;e our follow-creatures, "that are made after the &s;imilitude of God?" <HI>James</HI> iii. 9. Certainly the&s;e things ought not &s;o to be; the grace of the go&s;pel teaches, by precept and example, "to ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, ble&s;s and cur&s;e not, love your enemies; do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that de&s;pitefully u&s;e and per|&s;ecute you." Here we are warranted to make u&s;e of the Saviour's name, in praying for our enemies; he bids us, and &s;ets the example. How contrary the profane practice of calling on his name to damn tho&s;e we think injure or di&s;plea&s;e us! It comes as evidently from the de&s;troyer, our adver&s;ary, the devil, as the above-mentioned precepts and examples come from the Saviour. Stop dear child! &s;top young man, over-heated with pa&s;&s;ion and re&s;entment, and hurried by temptation! &s;top one minute and con&s;ider which you ought to follow: Hear the apo&s;tle, "Let all evil &s;peaking&punc;be put away from you, with all malice."</P>
<P>The next branch of evil &s;peaking I would take notice of, is uncleanne&s;s. If we con&s;ider the warnings and cautions

What &s;hameful ingratitude doth it di&s;cover, when we &s;ee our children, who are pri|viledged in their education &s;o as to be able to write their thoughts legibly, defiling the fences, as they pa&s;s the &s;treets, with &s;hameful uncleanne&s;s! writing what they would at fir&s;t be afraid to &s;peak, 'till their minds are hardened by writing, then reading and repeating, 'till they contract a habit of evil &s;peaking; which has a tendency, as they grow up, to lead after all uncleanne&s;s with greedine&s;s. I think I may tell them with truth, if they &s;hould live two or three times twenty years after, it would not obliterate, but in|crea&s;e the &s;hame that &s;uch conduct mu&s;t produce, upon the remembrance of &s;uch follies; for old age has a lively re|membrance of what is done in youth, though it forgets later tran&s;actions; and the &s;en&s;e of forgivne&s;s doth not take away the ground of &s;hame, but increa&s;es it, agreeable to <HI>Ezekiel</HI> xvi. 63. "That thou may&s;t remember and be a&s;hamed and confounded, and never open thy mouth any more becau&s;e of thy &s;hame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou ha&s;t done, &s;aith the Lord God."&mdash;This I would clo&s;e with the advice of Divine wi&s;dom. <HI>Pro|verbs</HI> vii. 24. to 27. "Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth; let not thine heart decline to her ways; go not a&s;tray in her paths; for &s;he hath ca&s;t down many wounded, yea, many &s;trong have been &s;lain by her: Her hou&s;e the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death."</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="018214_0051_0FA5C1DDAA613288">
I might mention the &s;cripture warnings and cautions again&s;t covetou&s;ne&s;s, &s;tealing and lying. Covetou&s;ne&s;s in children di&s;covers it&s;elf in a fretful unea&s;ine&s;s for what be|longs to other children, prompting them to attain it by any means, if it can't be had, as they &s;ay, by fair means, and tempts them to &s;teal, and then to lye to hide the crime. The &s;tory of Achan is left on record for warning and ad|monition, which we have in <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> vii. particularly ver&s;es 20 and 21, where Achan &s;ays, "Indeed I have &s;inned again&s;t the LORD GOD of I&s;rael, when I &s;aw among the &s;poils a goodly Babyloni&s;h garment, and two hundred &s;hekels of &s;ilver, and a wedge of gold, of fifty &s;hekels weight, then I coveted them and took them, and behold them hid in the earth, in the mid&s;t of my tent." &amp;c.</P>
<P>Covetou&s;ne&s;s is idolatry, it makes an idol of what it fixes on: Can there be any thing more ba&s;e and di&s;inge|nious, when we con&s;ider what God is to us, and hath done for us, than to prefer any thing our pevi&s;h minds covet after, and in pur&s;uit of it to di&s;obey him. The apo&s;tle &s;peaking to the Ephe&s;ians, who were in &s;ome mea|&s;ure acquainted with what God in Chri&s;t was to them, and had done for them, &s;ays, chap. iv 28. "Let him that &s;tole, &s;teal no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing that is good, as &s;hewing a more ex|cellent way of attaining what we need, and helping tho&s;e that may need help from us. And in the &s;ame chapter, he exhorts to put away lying, and &s;peak truth "every man to his neighbour," from this motive, "for we are members one of another;" therefore, in this view, we act as if we would deceive our&s;elves, as if the eye &s;hould pur|po&s;ely betray the feet into the mire.</P>
<P>By what has been brought to view of the ingratitude and ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;ome of the many works of the fle&s;h, &s;omething is di&s;coverable of the &s;ource from whence they proceed, and of the darkne&s;s, di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery to which they tend: It may lead to the &s;ame reflections on all the works of the fle&s;h, which are brought to view by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Matthew</HI> xv&punc; 19. 20. <HI>Mark</HI> vii. 21. 22. and by the apo&s;tle, <HI>Gallations</HI> v 19. 20. 21.

<P>Thus, dear children, I have endeavoured to lead your minds to the grace revealed in the go&s;pel, and to the view of the obligations this grace lays upon us;&mdash;if you accept my attempt, and are hereby excited to turn over the pages of revelation and to attend to Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, &s;peaking in them, I have all I wi&s;h for from you: I know I am not my own, and that every opportunity and talent I have, belongs to my Redeemer; therefore, &s;o far as duty to him. and love to you hath excited me hereto, I have rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied, whatever reception it hath. To his honor and glory, and your comfort and benefit it is de|voted. To the only wi&s;e God our Saviour, glory and maje&s;ty, dominion and power, both now and ever. AMEN.</P>
