<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I AM very well aware what different effects the pub|li&s;hing this Letter again&s;t dear Mr. We&s;ley's Ser|mon, will produce. Many of my friends who are &s;trenuous advocates for <HI>Univer&s;al Redemption,</HI> will be immediately offended. Many that are zealous on the other &s;ide, will much rejoice. Tho&s;e that are luke|warm on both &s;ides, and are carried away with <HI>carnal Rea&s;oning,</HI> will wi&s;h this matter had never been brought under debate. The rea&s;ons I have given at the beginning of the Letter, I think, are &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy all. I de&s;ire therefore that tho&s;e who hold <HI>Election,</HI> would not triumph or make a party on the one hand: (For I dete&s;t any &s;uch thing) And that tho&s;e who are prejudiced again&s;t that doctrine, would not be too much concerned or offended on the other. Known unto God are all his ways from the beginning of the world. The great day will di&s;cover why the Lord permits dear Mr. We&s;ley and me, to be of a different way of thinking. And I cannot expre&s;s my &s;elf better in re&s;pect to this, than in the words of a Letter which I lately received from his own dear hands.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thank you for yours, May <HI>24.</HI> The ca&s;e is quite plain. There are bigots both for <HI>Prede&s;ti|nation</HI> and again&s;t it. God is &s;ending a me&s;&s;age to
<PB REF="023998_0004_0FC2EC917AF7C788">
tho&s;e on either &s;ide: but neither will receive it, un|le&s;s from one who is of their own opinion. There|fore for a time you are &s;uffered to be of one opinion, and I of another. But when his time is come, God will do what man cannot, namely, make us both of one mind. Then per&s;ecution will flame out; and it will be &s;een whether we count our lives dear unto our&s;elves, &s;o that we may fini&s;h our cour&s;e with joy.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Thus, (my honoured friend!) I heartily pray God to ha&s;ten the time of our union in principles as well as in heart! And then I care not if I go with him to pri|&s;on or to death. With Paul and Silas, I hope we &s;hall &s;ing prai&s;es to God, and count it our highe&s;t honour to &s;uffer for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, and lay down our lives for the brethren.</P>

<SALUTE>Rev. and very dear Brother!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GOD only knows what un&s;peakable &s;orrow of heart I have felt on your account ever &s;ince I left England la&s;t. Whither it be my infirmity or not, I frankly confe&s;s that never did Jonah go with more reluctance again&s;t Nineveh, than I now take pen in hand to write again&s;t you. Was nature to &s;peak, I had rather die than do it: and yet if I am faithful to God, and to my own and others &s;ouls, I mu&s;t not &s;tand neuter any longer. I am well aware how our adver&s;aries will rejoice to &s;ee us differing among our&s;elves. But what can I &s;ay? The Children of God are in danger of falling into error. Nay, numbers have been mi&s;led, whom God was plea&s;ed to work upon by my mini&s;try; and a great number &s;till are calling aloud upon <HI>me</HI> al&s;o to &s;hew my opinion. I mu&s;t then &s;hew that I know no man after the fle&s;h, and that I have no re&s;pect of per&s;ons any farther than is con&s;i&s;tent with my duty to my Lord and Ma&s;ter Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>This letter al&s;o will undoubtedly lo&s;e me many
<PB N="6" REF="023998_0006_0FC2EC94B8D8EAE0">
friends. But for this cau&s;e among others, perhaps God &s;tirs me up to write it, viz. to &s;ee whether I will for&s;ake all for him or not. I think I have truth and &s;cripture on my &s;ide. I think it my duty to be &s;imple and con&s;i&s;tent, and leave the con&s;e|quences of all to God.</P>
<P>I fear I have been &s;infully &s;ilent too long. For &s;ome time before, and e&s;pecially &s;ince my la&s;t de|parture from England, both in publick and private, by preaching and printing, you have been propa|gating the doctrine of Univer&s;al Redemption; and therefore, if Paul reproved Peter for his Di&s;&s;imu|lation, (dear and honored Sir) O be not angry with me, if I deliver my &s;oul in telling you that I think in this you nearly err.</P>
<P>'Tis not my de&s;ign to enter into a long debate on GOD's decrees. I refer you to Dr. Edwards's Veritas Redux; who I think is unan&s;werable, except in a certain point, concerning a middle &s;ort between elect and reprobate, which he him&s;elf in effect afterwards condemns. I mu&s;t fir&s;t inform you, that I think you had no call to be &s;o explicit in the doctrine of univer&s;al redemption.</P>
<P>If I mi&s;take not when at Bri&s;tol, you received a letter from a private hand, charging you with not preaching the go&s;pel, becau&s;e you did not preach up election. Upon this you drew a lot. The an&s;wer was, "preach and print." I have often que&s;tioned as I do now, whether in &s;o doing you did not tempt the Lord? Common prudence without a lot would have directed you in that matter.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I never heard that you inquired of GOD, whether or not election was a go&s;pel doctrine?
<PB N="7" REF="023998_0007_0FC2ECA4A47F6DF8">
But I fear taking it for granted it was not&mdash;you on|ly inquired, whether you &s;hould be &s;ilent, or preach and print again&s;t it. However this be, the lot came out, preach and print. Accordingly, you preached and printed again&s;t election. At my de|&s;ire you &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the publi&s;hing the &s;ermon 'till I left England; but &s;oon after &s;ent it into the world after my departure. Oh that you had kept it in! If that &s;ermon was printed in an&s;wer to a lot, I can give no other rea&s;on why God &s;hould &s;uffer you to be deceived, unle&s;s that thereby a door might be opened hereafter for preaching up election: and that God might give me another opportunity, as he once did, by giving you &s;uch another lot at<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The morning I &s;ailed from Deal for Gibraltar, Mr. We&s;ley arrived from Georgia. In&s;tead of coming on board to conver&s;e with me, though the &s;hip was not far off the &s;hore he drew a lot, and immediately &s;et for|wards for London. Behind him he leaves a letter for me, in which were words to this effect. <Q>When I &s;aw GOD, by the wind which was car|rying you out, brought me in, I a&s;ked coun&s;el of GOD. His an&s;wer, you have enclo&s;ed.</Q> This was a piece of paper in which were written the&s;e words. "Let him return to London." When I received this a good man telling me he had ca&s;t a lot, and that GOD would have me re|turn to London. On the other hand, I knew that my call was to Geor|gia, and that I had taken leave of London, and could not ju&s;tly go from the &s;oldiers who were committed to my charge. I betook my&s;elf with a friend to prayer. That pa&s;&s;age in the fir&s;t book of Kings, chap. xiii. where we are told "that the prophet was &s;lain by a Lion, that tempted to go back contrary to God's expre&s;s order, upon another prophet's telling him that God would have him do &s;o&mdash;This pa&s;&s;age, I &s;ay, was powerfully im|pre&s;&s;ed upon my &s;oul.&mdash;I wrote dear Mr. We&s;ley word that I could not return to London. We &s;ailed immediately. Some months after I receiv|ed a letter from him at Georgia, wherein he wrote in words to this effect, "Tho' GOD never before gave me a wrong lot, yet perhaps he &s;uffered me to have &s;uch a lot at that time to try what was in your heart." I &s;hould never have publi&s;hed this private tran&s;action to the world, did not the glory of God call me to it. It is plain that dear Mr. We&s;ley had a wrong lot given him here, and ju&s;tly, becau&s;e he tempted God in draw|ing one. And thus I believe it is in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. And if &s;o, let not the children of God, who are mine and Mr. We&s;ley's intimate friends, and are &s;uch advocates for Univer&s;al Redemption, think that doctrine true, becau&s;e dear Mr. We&s;ley preach'd it up in compliance with a lot given out from God.</NOTE> Deal, of &s;eeing what was in my heart, and whether I would be faithful to his cau&s;e or not. Oh that it may be al&s;o for the conviction of dear Mr. We&s;ley; that we may both think and &s;peak the &s;ame things, and con&s;equently be better qualified to build up tho&s;e &s;ouls that have been lately awaken'd, in their mo&s;t holy faith!</P>
<P>This I think may &s;erve as an an&s;wer to the fir&s;t part of the preface to your printed &s;ermon, where|in you &s;ay, <Q>Nothing but the &s;tronge&s;t conviction,
<PB N="8" REF="023998_0008_0FC2ECA5CA5147F8">
not only that what is here advanced is the truth as it is in Je&s;us, but al&s;o that I am indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged to declare this truth to all the world, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>That you believe what you have wrote is truth, and that you hone&s;tly aim at GOD's glory in wri|ting, I do not in the lea&s;t doubt. But then, ho|nored Sir, if by tempting GOD, in ca&s;ting a lot, as before mentioned, you have thought your&s;elf in|di&s;pen&s;ably obliged to publi&s;h your &s;ermon again&s;t prede&s;tination, I think, in this you have been much mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>But farther; as you have been unhappy in prin|ting at all, &s;o you have been unhappy al&s;o in the choice of your text. Honored Sir! how could it enter into your heart to chu&s;e a text to di&s;prove the doctrine of election, out of the eighth of the Romans? Where the doctrine is &s;o plainly a&s;&s;ert|ed, that once talking with a Quaker, upon this &s;ubject, he had no other way of evading the force of the Apo&s;tle's a&s;&s;ertion, than by &s;aying, I believe
<PB N="9" REF="023998_0009_0FC2ECA7419EA858">
Paul was in the wrong. Another friend lately, who was once highly prejudiced again&s;t election, inge|niou&s;ly confe&s;s'd, that he u&s;ed to think, St. Paul him&s;elf was mi&s;taken, or that he was not truly tran&s;|lated.</P>
<P>Indeed, honored Sir, it is plain beyond all Con|tradiction, that St. Paul, thro' the whole eighth chapter of the Romans, is &s;peaking of the priviliges of tho&s;e only who are really in Chri&s;t. And let any unprejudiced per&s;on, read what goes before, and what follows your text, and he mu&s;t confe&s;s the word ALL only &s;ignifies, tho&s;e that are in Chri&s;t; and the latter part of the text, plainly proves what I find dear Mr. We&s;ley will by no means grant, I mean, the final per&s;everance of the children of GOD. <HI>He that &s;pareth not his own Son, but deliv|ered him up for us all, how &s;hall he not with him al&s;o freely give us all things?</HI> Viz. Grace to per&s;evere, and every thing nece&s;&s;ary to bring us &s;afely home to our heavenly father's kingdom.</P>
<P>Had I a mind to prove election and final per&s;e|verance, I know not that I could chu&s;e a better text than you have cho&s;en to di&s;prove it. One that does not know you, would &s;u&s;pect you. You your&s;elf were &s;en&s;ible of this. For after the fir&s;t paragraph I &s;carce know whether you have mentioned it, &s;o much as once, through your whole di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But your di&s;cour&s;e, in my opinion, is as little to the purpo&s;e as your text; and in&s;tead of warping&punc; does but more and more confirm me in the Belief of the doctrine of GOD's <HI>eternal election.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not mention how illogically you have pro|ceeded. Had you wrote clearly, you &s;hould fir&s;t,
<PB N="10" REF="023998_0010_0FC2ECA8B3D34DB0">
honored Sir, have proved your propo&s;ition. That GOD's grace is free to all; and then by way of inference, exclaimed again&s;t what you call the hor|rible decree. But you knew people (becau&s;e Ar|miniani&s;m of late, has &s;o much abounded among us) were generally prejudiced again&s;t the doctrine of reprobation, and therefore thought, if you kept up their di&s;like of that, you would overthrow the doctrine of election entirely. For, without doubt, the doctrine of election and reprobation mu&s;t &s;tand or fall togther.</P>
<P>But pa&s;&s;ing by this, as al&s;o your equivocal defi|nition of the word grace, and your fal&s;e definition of the word free; that I may be as &s;hort as po&s;&s;i|ble, I frankly acknowledge, I believe the doctrine of reprobation; and that God intends only to give a certain number &s;aving grace, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and that the re&s;t of mankind are left to peri&s;h un|der the imputation of Adam's guilt, and will be damned for that and their actual &s;ins. This is e|&s;tabli&s;hed doctrine of &s;cripture, and of the XVIIth article of the church of England; as bi&s;hop Bur|net him&s;elf confe&s;&s;es. Dear Mr. We&s;ley ab&s;olute|ly denies them both. And why?</P>
<P><Q>For if this be &s;o, (&s;ays he, page the 10th, pa|ragraph the 9th) then is all preaching vain.&mdash; It is needle&s;s to them that are elected. For they whether with preaching or without, will infalli|bly be &s;aved. Therefore the end of preaching, to &s;ave &s;ouls, is void with regard to them. And it is u&s;ele&s;s to them that are not elected. For they cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;aved. They, whether with preaching or without, will infalliably be
<PB N="11" REF="023998_0011_0FC2ECB0536940E8">
damned. The end of preaching is therefore void with regard to them likewi&s;e. So that in either ca&s;e, our preaching is vain, as your hearing is al&s;o vain.</Q></P>
<P>O dear Sir! What kind of rea&s;oning, or rather &s;ophi&s;try, is this? Hath not God, who hath appoin|ted &s;alvation for a certain number, appointed al&s;o the preaching of the word as a means to bring them to &s;alvation? Does any one hold election in any other &s;en&s;e? And if &s;o, how is preaching needle&s;s to them that are elected, when it is de&s;igned by God, to be the power of God unto their eternal &s;al|vation? And, &s;ince we know not who are elect and who reprobate, we are to preach promi&s;cuou&s;ly to all. If it be u&s;ele&s;s to the reprobate, it is no more than what God de&s;igned to permit. It's e|nough that all are brought home by it that he in|tended.</P>
<P>Secondly, You &s;ay, page the 11th, <Q>That it, viz. the doctrine of election and reprobation, di|rectly tends to de&s;troy that holine&s;s which is the end of all the ordinances of God.</Q> For, (&s;ays the dear mi&s;taken Mr. We&s;ley) <Q>it wholly takes away tho&s;e fir&s;t motives to follow after it, &s;o fre|quently propo&s;ed in &s;cripture. The hope of future rewards, and fear of puni&s;hments, the hopes of heaven, and the fear of hell, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>I thought one that carrys perfection to &s;uch an exlated pitch as dear Mr. We&s;ley does, would know a true lover of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, would &s;trive to be holy for the &s;ake of being holy, and work for Chri&s;t out of love and gratitude, without any re|gard to the reward of heaven or fear of hell. You
<PB N="12" REF="023998_0012_0FC2ECB4F0963798">
remember, dear &s;ir, what Scougal &s;ays&mdash;Love's a more powerful motive that does them move.</P>
<P>But pa&s;&s;ing by this, and granting that rewards and puni&s;hments (as they certainly are) may be motives, from which a chri&s;tian may be hone&s;tly &s;tirred up to act for God; how does the doctrine of election de&s;troy tho&s;e motives? Do not the elect know that the more good works they do, the grea|ter will be their reward? And is it not that en|couragement enough to &s;et them upon, and cau&s;e them to per&s;evere in working for Je&s;us Chri&s;t?&mdash; And how does the doctrine of election de&s;troy ho|line&s;s? Whoever preached any other election than what the Apo&s;tle preached, when he &s;aid, Cho&s;en thro' &s;anctification of the &s;pirit? Nay, is not holi|ne&s;s made a mark of our election by all that preach it? And how then can election de&s;troy holine&s;s?</P>
<P>The in&s;tance which you bring, page 11, to il|lu&s;trate your a&s;&s;ertion, indeed, dear &s;ir, is quite im|pertinent; for you &s;ay, <Q>If a &s;ick man knows, that he mu&s;t unavoidably die, or unavoidably reco|ver; though he knows not which, it is not rea|&s;onable to take any phy&s;ick at all.</Q> Dear Sir! what ab&s;urd rea&s;oning is here? Was you ever &s;ick in your life? If &s;o, did not the bare proba|bility or po&s;&s;ibility of your recovering though you knew it was unalterably fixed that you mu&s;t live or die, encourage you to take phy&s;ick? For how did you know but that very phy&s;ick might be the means God intended to recover you by? Ju&s;t thus it is in the doctrine of election. I know that it is unalte|rably fixed that I mu&s;t be damned, or &s;aved. But &s;ince I know not which, for a certainty, why &s;hould
<PB N="13" REF="023998_0013_0FC2ECBDD228BA38">
I not &s;trive, though in a &s;tate of nature, &s;ince I know not but this &s;triving may be the means God has intended to ble&s;s in order to bring me into a &s;tate of grace? Dear &s;ir! con&s;ider the&s;e things&mdash; Make an impartial application, and then judge what little rea&s;on you had to conclude the 10th paragraph, page the 12th, in the&s;e words,&mdash;<Q>So directly does this doctrine tend to &s;hut the very gate of holine&s;s in general, to hinder unholy men, from ever approaching thereto or &s;triving to en|ter in thereat.</Q></P>
<P>As directly, &s;ay you, (paragraph 11th) <Q>does this doctrine tend to de&s;troy &s;everal particular bran|ches of holine&s;s&mdash;&s;uch as meekne&s;s, love, &amp;c.</Q> I &s;hall &s;ay little in an&s;wer to this paragraph. Dear Mr. We&s;ley, perhaps has been di&s;puting with &s;ome warm narrow-&s;pirited men, that held election, and then infers that their warmth and narrowne&s;s of &s;pirit are owing to their principles. Does not Mr. We&s;ley know many dear children of God who are prede&s;tinarians, and yet are meek, lowly, pitiful, courteous, tender-hearted, of a catholick Spirit, and kind, and have hope even of the mo&s;t vile?&mdash; And why? Becau&s;e they know God &s;aved them by an act of his electing love, and they know not but he may have elected tho&s;e who are now even the mo&s;t abandoned. But, dear &s;ir, we mu&s;t not judge of the truth of principles in general, nor of this of elec|tion in particular, entirely from people's practice: If &s;o, I am &s;ure more might be &s;aid again&s;t you. For I appeal to your heart, whether you do not feel a narrow-&s;piritedne&s;s towards, and &s;ome di&s;union of &s;oul from tho&s;e that hold particular redemption.
<PB N="14" REF="023998_0014_0FC2ECBF385C6BC8">
If &s;o, then according to your own rule, Univer&s;al Redemption is wrong, becau&s;e it de&s;troys &s;everal branches of holine&s;s&mdash;&s;uch as meekne&s;s, love, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle St. Paul was not of your opinion,&mdash; For, Col. iii. 12, 13,&mdash;he &s;ays, <Q>Putting on there|fore (as the elect of God, holy and beloved) bowels of mercy, kindne&s;s, humblene&s;s of mind, meekne&s;s, long-&s;uffering; forbearing one another and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel again&s;t any; even as Chri&s;t forgave you, &s;o al&s;o do ye.</Q> Here we &s;ee that the apo&s;tle ex|horts them to put on bowels of mercy, kindne&s;s, humblene&s;s of mind, meekne&s;s, long-&s;uffering, &amp;c. Upon this con&s;ideration, namely, becau&s;e they were the elect of God. And all who have experiment|ally felt this doctrine in their heart, will feel that the&s;e graces are the genuine effects of their be|ing elected of God.</P>
<P>But perhaps dear Mr. We&s;ley may be mi&s;taken in this point, and call that pa&s;&s;ion, which is only zeal for God's truths. You know, dear &s;ir, the apo&s;tle exhorts us to contend earne&s;tly for the faith once delivered to the &s;aints; and therefore you mu&s;t not condemn all who appear warm for the doc|trine of election, as narrow-&s;pirited, or per&s;ecutors, becau&s;e they think it their duty to oppo&s;e you. I am &s;ure I love you in the bowels of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I think I could lay down my life for your &s;ake; but yet, dear &s;ir, I cannot avoid oppo&s;ing you &s;tre|nuou&s;ly in this point, becau&s;e I think you warmly, tho' I really believe not de&s;ignedly oppo&s;e the truth as it is in Je&s;us.&mdash;May the Lord remove the &s;cales of prejudice from off the eyes of your mind, and
<PB N="15" REF="023998_0015_0FC2ECC0B965E0D0">
give you a zeal according to true chri&s;tian knowl|edge!</P>
<P>Thirdly, Says your Sermon, page 13, paragraph the 12th; <Q>This doctrine tends to de&s;troy the com|forts of religion, the happine&s;s of chri&s;tianity.</Q></P>
<P>But how does Mr. We&s;ley know this, who never believed election? I believe they who have expe|rienced it will agree with our XVIIth article, That <Q>the godly con&s;ideration of prede&s;tination and our election in Chri&s;t, is full of &s;weet plea&s;ures, and un&s;peakable comfort to godly per&s;ons, and &s;uch as feel in them&s;elves the working of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, mortifying the works of the fle&s;h, and their earthly members, and drawing their minds to high and heavenly things; as well becau&s;e it does greatly e&s;tabli&s;h and confirm their faith of eternal &s;alvation, to be enjoyed through Chri&s;t; as becau&s;e it doth firmly kindle their love towards God:</Q> which plainly &s;hews that our godly refor|mers did not think election de&s;troyed holine&s;s, or the comforts of religion. As for my own part, this doctrine is my daily &s;upport,&mdash;I &s;hould utterly &s;ink under a &s;en&s;e of my impending trials, was I not firmly per&s;uaded Chri&s;t had cho&s;en me from before the foundation of the world, and therefore will &s;uf|fer nothing to pluck me finally out of his almighty hands.</P>
<P>You proceed thus, <Q>This is evident to all tho&s;e that believe them&s;elves to be reprobate; or only &s;u&s;pect or fear it. All the great and precious promi&s;es are lo&s;t to them;&mdash;they afford them no ray of comfort.</Q></P>
<P>And would dear Mr. We&s;ley give comfort, or
<PB N="16" REF="023998_0016_0FC2ECC25307AC70">
dare to apply the precious promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, (that children's bread) to men in a natural &s;tate? God forbid! What if the doctrine of election and reprobation does put &s;ome upon doubting? Is not this a good means to put them upon &s;triving; and that &s;triving a good means to make their calling, and thereby their election &s;ure? This is one rea&s;on among many others, why I admire the doctrine of election. It has a natural tendency to rou&s;e the &s;oul out of its carnal &s;ecurity: and therefore &s;o ma|ny carnal men cry out again&s;t it. Univer&s;al Re|demption has a natural tendency to keep the &s;oul in its carnal &s;ecurity; and therefore &s;o many natural men admire and applaud it.</P>
<P>Your three following paragraphs, 13, 14, 15, come next to be con&s;idered. <Q>The witne&s;s of the Spirit, (you &s;ay, paragraph 14, page 14) experi|ence &s;hews to be much ob&s;tructed by this doc|trine.</Q> But, dear &s;ir, who&s;e experience? Not your own: for in your la&s;t journal, you &s;eem to acknowledge you have it not; and therefore you are no proper judge in this matter. You mu&s;t mean the experience of others; for you &s;ay, in the &s;ame paragraph, <Q>Even in tho&s;e that have ta&s;ted of that good gift, who have yet &s;oon lo&s;t it again (I &s;up|po&s;e you mean lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of it again) and fal|len back into doubts, and fears, and darkne&s;s, even horrible darkne&s;s that might be felt, &amp;c.</Q> And was not this the ca&s;e of Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf, after that he had received the Holy Gho&s;t? Was he not led by the Spirit into the wilderne&s;s to be tempted of the devil? Was not his &s;oul exceed|ing &s;orrowful, even unto death, in the garden?&mdash;
<PB N="17" REF="023998_0017_0FC2ECD28AC42638">
And was he not &s;urrounded with an horrible dark|ne&s;s, even "a darkne&s;s that might be felt,"&mdash;when on the cro&s;s, he cried out, My God! my God! why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me? And that his followers mu&s;t expect the &s;ame, is it not evident from &s;cripture? For, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, he was tempted in all things, like unto his brethren, that he might be able to &s;uc|cour tho&s;e that are tempted. And why then &s;hould per&s;ons falling into darkne&s;s, after they have recei|ved the witne&s;s of the Spirit, be any arguments again&s;t the doctrine of election? <Q>Yes, you &s;ay, many, very many of tho&s;e that hold it not in all parts of the earth, have enjoyed the uninterrupted witne&s;s of the Spirit, the continual light of God's countenance, from the moment wherein they fir&s;t believed, for many months and years to this very day.</Q> But how does dear Mr. We&s;ley know this? Has he con&s;ulted the experience of many, very many in all parts of the earth? Or &s;uppo&s;ing he had, does it follow that their being kept in this light, is owing to their not believing the Doctrine of election? No, this, according to the &s;entiments of our church, <Q>greatly confirms and e&s;tabli&s;hes a true chri&s;tian's faith of eternal &s;alvation through Chri&s;t,</Q> and is an anchor of hope both &s;ure and &s;tedfa&s;t when he walks in darkne&s;s and &s;ees no light; as a true chri&s;tian certainly may do, after he has received the witne&s;s of the &s;pirit, whatever you or others may unadvi&s;edly a&s;&s;ert to the contrary. Then to have re&s;pect to God's everla&s;ting covenant and throw him&s;elf upon the free di&s;tingui&s;hing love of that God who changeth not; this I &s;ay, makes him to lift up the hands that
<PB N="18" REF="023998_0018_0FC2ECD4A6615910">
hang down, and &s;trengthens his feeble knees.&mdash; Without believing the doctrine of election I cannot &s;ee how we can arrive at a full a&s;&s;urance of faith: an a&s;&s;urance that <Q>all my pa&s;t &s;ins are forgiven, and that I am now a child of God;</Q> but may hereafter, for all that I know, become a child of the devil, and be ca&s;t into hell at la&s;t; is no a&s;&s;urance at all, at lea&s;t not a full a&s;&s;urance. No, a full a&s;&s;u|rance of faith makes the &s;oul give men and devils the challenge, not only for the pre&s;ent, but for the future. Who &s;hall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is Chri&s;t that ju&s;tifies me, who is he that condemns me? It is Chri&s;t that died; yea rather that is ri&s;en again, who is even at the right-hand of God, who al&s;o maketh interce&s;&s;ion for me. Who &s;hall &s;eperate me from the love of Chri&s;t? Shall tribulation, or di&s;tre&s;s, or per&s;ecution or fa|mine, or nakedne&s;s, or peril, or &s;word: Nay in all the&s;e things I am more than conqueror through him that loved me. For I am per&s;uaded that nei|ther death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things pre&s;ent, nor things to come, nor heighth, nor depth, nor any other creature, &s;hall be able to &s;eperate me from the love of God which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us my Lord.</P>
<P>This, dear Sir, is the triumphant language of every &s;oul that has attained a full a&s;&s;urance of faith. And this a&s;&s;urance can only ari&s;e from a be|lief of God's electing everla&s;ting love. That many have an a&s;&s;urance that they are in Chri&s;t to day, but take no thought for, or are not a&s;&s;ured that they &s;hall be in him to-morrow, nay, to all eternity, is rather their imperfections and unhappine&s;s, than
<PB N="19" REF="023998_0019_0FC2ECD610FEA5A0">
their privilege. I pray God bring all &s;uch to a &s;en&s;e of his eternal love, that they may no longer build upon their own faithfulne&s;s, but on the un|changeablene&s;s of that God who&s;e gifts and calling are without repentance; for tho&s;e whom God has once ju&s;tified he al&s;o will glorify.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved before, dear &s;ir, it is not always a &s;afe rule to judge of the truth of principles from people's practice. And therefore, &s;uppo&s;e all that hold Uni|ver&s;al Redemption, in your way of explaining it, after they receiv'd &s;aith, enjoy the continual unin|terrupted light of God's countenance, it does not follow that this is a fruit of their principle: for that I am &s;ure has a natural tendency to keep the &s;oul in darkne&s;s forever&mdash;becau&s;e the creature is thereby taught, that his being kept in a &s;tate of &s;al|vation, is owing to his own free-will: and what a &s;andy foundation is that for a poor creature to build his hopes of per&s;everance upon? Every relap&s;e into &s;in, every &s;urprize by temptation, mu&s;t throw him <Q>into doubts and fears, into horrible darkne&s;s, even darkne&s;s that might be felt.</Q> Hence it is that the letters which have been lately &s;ent me by tho&s;e who hold Univer&s;al Redemption, are dead, lifele&s;s, dry and incon&s;i&s;tant, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e I receive from per&s;ons on the contrary &s;ide. Tho&s;e on the one &s;ide, though they might begin in the &s;pirit (whatever they may &s;ay to the contrary) are ending in the fle&s;h, and building up a righteou&s;|ne&s;s founded on their own free-will. Whil&s;t the others triumph in hopes of the glory of God; and built upon God's never-fading promi&s;e, and un|changeable, love, even when his &s;en&s;ible pre&s;ence
<PB N="20" REF="023998_0020_0FC2ECDDEF10B8A8">
is withdrawn from them. But I would not judge of the truth of election by the experience of any particular per&s;ons: If I did (Oh bear with me in this fooli&s;hne&s;s of boa&s;ting) I think I my &s;elf might glory in election. For the&s;e five or &s;ix years I have received the witne&s;s of God's Spirit; and &s;ince that I have not doubted a quarter of an hour of my having a &s;aving intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But I have fallen into &s;in &s;ince that; and tho I lay the blame wholly on my own wicked heart, yet, perhaps it was permitted that I might confute tho&s;e who hold a man cannot commit &s;in after he is born again. I have been al&s;o in heavine&s;s through ma|nifold temptations, and expect to be often &s;o again before I die. Thus was St. Paul him&s;elf. Thus was Luther, that man of God, who did not hold election: and the great John Arndt, was in the utmo&s;t perplexity a quarter of an hour before he died, and yet he was no prede&s;tinarian; and if I mu&s;t &s;peak freely I believe your writing &s;o &s;trenu|ou&s;ly again&s;t the doctrine of election, and pleading up a &s;inle&s;s perfection, is one great cau&s;e why you are kept out of the liberties of the go&s;pel, and that full a&s;&s;urance of faith which tho&s;e enjoy who have experimentally ta&s;ted, and daily feed upon God's electing everla&s;ting love.</P>
<P>But perhaps you may &s;ay, That Luther and Arndt were no chri&s;tians. I know you think meanly of Abraham and David; and have wrote me word, <Q>That no bapti&s;t or pre&s;byterian writer whom you have read, knew any thing of the liberties of Chri&s;t.</Q> See, dear Sir, what narrow-&s;piritedne&s;s and want of charity ari&s;es from your principles:
<PB N="21" REF="023998_0021_0FC2ECE162BB0978">
and then do not cry out again&s;t election any more on account of its being "de&s;tructive of meekne&s;s and love."</P>
<P>To proceed. Again, &s;ays the dear Mr. We&s;ley, page 15, paragraph the 16th, <Q>How uncomforta|ble a thought is this, That thou&s;ands and milli|ons of men, without any preceeding offence or fault of theirs, were unchangeably doomed to everla&s;ting burnings?</Q></P>
<P>But whoever a&s;&s;erted, that thou&s;ands and milli|ons of men, without any preceeding offence or fault of theirs, were unchangeably doom'd to ever|la&s;ting burnings? Do not tho&s;e who plead up for God's dooming men to everla&s;ting burnings, &s;up|po&s;e God looks upon them as men fallen in A|dam? How then are they doomed without any pre|ceeding fault? Surely Mr. We&s;ley will own God's ju&s;tice in imputing Adam's &s;in to his po&s;terity: And al&s;o that after Adam fell, and his po&s;terity in him, God might ju&s;tly have pa&s;&s;ed them all by without &s;ending any one of them a Saviour. Un|le&s;s you own both the&s;e things, you do not believe original &s;in aright. If you do own them, you mu&s;t acknowledge the doctrine of election and reproba|tion to be rea&s;onable. For if God might ju&s;tly have imputed Adam's &s;in to all, and afterwards have pa&s;&s;ed by all, he might ju&s;tly pa&s;s by &s;ome.&mdash; Turn either on the right hand or on the left, you are reduced to an inextricable dilemma.</P>
<P>Your 17th paragraph, page 16, I pa&s;s over.&mdash; What has been &s;aid on paragraph the 9th and 10th, with little alteration, will an&s;wer it. I &s;hall only &s;ay, 'tis the doctrine of election that mo&s;tly pre&s;&s;es
<PB N="22" REF="023998_0022_0FC2ECE27709DFD0">
me to abound in good works: I am made willing to &s;uffer all things for the elect's &s;ake. This makes me preach with comfort becau&s;e I know &s;alvation does not depend on men's free-will, but the Lord makes a willing people in the day of his power, and may make u&s;e of me to bring &s;ome of his elect home.</P>
<P>But fifthly, you &s;ay, paragraph the 18th page 17, <Q>this doctrine has a direct and manife&s;t tendency to overthrow the whole chri&s;tian religion. For, &s;ay you, &s;uppo&s;ing that eternal unchangeable decree, one part of mankind mu&s;t be &s;aved, tho' the chri&s;tian Revelation were not in being.</Q></P>
<P>But, dear &s;ir, how does that follow, &s;ince it is on|ly by the chri&s;tian Revelation, that we are acquain|ted with God's de&s;ign in re&s;pect to mankind?&mdash; And how then has the doctrine of election a direct tendency to overthrow the whole chri&s;tian Revela|tion? For, has not God intended this Revelation as a means to bring his elect home? And how then in holding this doctrine, do we join with mo|dern unbelievers, in making the chri&s;tian Reve|lation unnece&s;&s;ary? No, dear &s;ir; you mi&s;take&mdash; Infidels of all kinds are on your &s;ide the que&s;tion. Dei&s;ts, Arians, Socinians, arraign God's &s;overeignty and &s;tand up for universal redemption. I pray God dear Mr. We&s;ley's Sermon, as it has grieved the hearts of many of God's dear children, it may not al&s;o &s;trengthen the hands of many of God's profe&s;s'd enemies! Here I could almo&s;t &s;it down and weep. O tell it not in Gath! Publi&s;h it not in the &s;treets of A&s;kalon; le&s;t the daughters of the uncircumci|&s;ed rejoice, le&s;t the &s;ons of unbelief triumph!</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="023998_0023_0FC2ECEA372DABE0">Further, you &s;ay, page 18, paragraph 19, <Q>this doctrine makes Revelation contradict it&s;elf.</Q>&mdash; For in&s;tance; &s;ay you, the a&s;&s;erters of this doctrine interpret that text of &s;cripture, "Jacob have I lo|ved, but E&s;au have I hated," as implying that God "in a literal &s;en&s;e, hated E&s;au and all the reprobate from eternity." And when con&s;idered as fallen in Adam, were they not objects of his hatred? And might not God, of his own good plea&s;ure, love or &s;hew mercy to Jacob, and the elect, and yet, at the &s;ame time, do the reprobate no wrong? But you &s;ay, "God is love." And cannot God be love, unle&s;s he &s;hews the &s;ame mercy to all?</P>
<P>Again, &s;ays dear Mr. We&s;ley, "they infer from that text, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, that God is love only to &s;ome men, viz. the elect; and that he hath mercy for tho&s;e only:&mdash; Flatly contrary to which is the whole tenor of the &s;cripture, as is that expre&s;s declaration in particu|lar: The Lord is loving to every man, and his mercies are over all his works." And &s;o they are; but not his &s;aving mercy. God is loving to eve|ry man; he &s;ends his rain upon the evil, and up|on the good. But you &s;ay, "God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons." No. For every one, whether Jew or Gentile, that believeth on Je&s;us, and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s, is accepted of him. Notwith&s;tand|ing the&s;e texts in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, God will have mercy on whom he will have mercy; nay, I will add, and whom he will he hardeneth.</P>
<P>You go on, page 20. "Again, from that text, the children being not yet born, neither having done good or evil, that the purpo&s;e of God, accor|ding
<PB N="24" REF="023998_0024_0FC2ECEE42B57370">
to election might &s;tand, not of works, but of him that calleth, it was &s;aid unto her (unto Rebec|ca) the elder &s;hall &s;erve the younger; they, (i. e. Prede&s;tinarians) infer that our prede&s;tination, or e|lection, no way depends on the fore-knowledge of God." But who infers this, dear &s;ir! For, if by fore-knowledge, you mean fore-knowledge as it &s;ignifies approbation, (as it does in &s;everal parts of &s;cripture,) then we confe&s;s that prede&s;tination and election do depend on God's fore-knowledge. But if by God's fore-knowledge, you under&s;tand God's fore&s;eeing &s;ome good works done by his creatures, and therefore electing them, then we &s;ay, that in this &s;en&s;e, prede&s;tination does not any way depend on God's fore-knowledge. But I referred you at the beginning of this letter to Dr. Edwards. Read his <HI>Veritas Redux,</HI> which I recommended to you in a late letter, with Eli&s;ha Cole on God's &s;overeignty. Be plea&s;ed to read tho&s;e; and al&s;o Mr. Cooper's &s;ermons of Bo&s;ton, which I likewi&s;e &s;ent you, and I doubt not but you will &s;ee all your objections an|&s;wered. Though I would ob&s;erve that after all our reading on both &s;ides the que&s;tion, we &s;hall never in this life be able to &s;earch out God's decrees to perfection: No; we mu&s;t humbly adore, what we cannot comprehend; and with the great Apo&s;tle, at the end of our inquiries, cry out, O the depth! &amp;c. Or with our Lord, when he was admiring God's &s;overeignty, even &s;o father, for &s;o it &s;eemeth good in thy &s;ight.</P>
<P>However it may not be ami&s;s to take notice that if tho&s;e texts <Q>God willeth that none &s;hould pe|ri&s;h.</Q> "I have no plea&s;ure in him that dieth,"
<PB N="25" REF="023998_0025_0FC2ECF1442CAE08">
and &s;uch like, be taken in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, then no one will be damned. For God may prevent every one's damnation if he plea&s;es, and cannot but in one &s;en&s;e, be &s;aid to will it, becau&s;e he might have prevented it if he would.</P>
<P>But here's the di&s;tinction,&mdash;God taketh no plea|&s;ure in the death of &s;inners, &s;o as to delight &s;imply in their death; tho' he delights to magnify his ju&s;|tice in their death. As a judge may take no plea|&s;ure in condemning a criminal, and yet ju&s;tly per|mit him to be executed (though in his power to procure him a reprieve) in order that they may &s;a|tisfy the ju&s;tice of the law.</P>
<P>I could hint farther, that you unju&s;tly charge the doctrine of reprobation with bla&s;phemy. But the doctrine of univer&s;al redemption, in your &s;en&s;e, is really bla&s;phemous. For judge, whether it be not bla&s;phemy to &s;ay, as you do, page 20. <Q>Chri&s;t not only died for tho&s;e that are &s;aved, but al&s;o for tho&s;e that peri&s;h.</Q> The text you have mi&s;|applied, to glo&s;s over this, &s;ee it explained by Ridg|ley, Edwards and Henry. I purpo&s;ely omit an|&s;wering this and &s;ome other texts my&s;elf, that you may be brought to read &s;uch treati&s;es, which un|der God, would &s;how you your error. You can|not, indeed &s;ir, you cannot make good the a&s;&s;er|tion, "that Chri&s;t died for them that peri&s;h," without holding (as <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the Moravian Brethren.</NOTE> Peter Bolcher, in order to make out univer&s;al redemption, lately frankly con|fe&s;&s;ed in a letter) that all the damned &s;ouls would hereafter be brought out of hell. I cannot think
<PB N="26" REF="023998_0026_0FC2ECF2360A6578">
Mr. We&s;ley thus minded. And yet without this can be proved, univer&s;al redemption, taken in a literal &s;en&s;e, falls entirely to the ground. For how can all be univer&s;ally redeemed, if all are not finally &s;aved?</P>
<P>Dear &s;ir! for Je&s;us Chri&s;t's &s;ake, con&s;ider how you di&s;honor God. By denying election you plain|ly make man's &s;alvation depend not on God's free grace, but man's free will. And if &s;o, Je&s;us Chri&s;t died at a venture, and perhaps would not have had one &s;oul as the purcha&s;e of his blood. Our preach|ing would then be vain, and our invitations to peo|ple to believe would be in vain al&s;o.</P>
<P>But, ble&s;&s;ed be God!&mdash;Our Lord knew for whom he died. There was an eternal compact be|tween the father, and the &s;on. A certain number was then given him, as the purcha&s;e of his obe|dience and death. For the&s;e he prayed, John xvii. &mdash;and not for the world. For the&s;e, and the&s;e on|ly, he is now interceeding; and with their &s;alvati|on, he will be fully &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>I purpo&s;ely omit making any further remarks on the &s;everal la&s;t pages of your &s;ermon. Indeed, had not your name, dear &s;ir, been prefixed to the &s;ermon, I could not have been &s;o uncharitable as to think you were the author of &s;uch &s;ophi&s;try. You beg the que&s;tion, in &s;aying, "that God has de|clared (notwith&s;tanding you own, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ome will be damned) that he will &s;ave all, i. e. every in|dividual per&s;on." You take it for granted, (for &s;olid proof you have none) that he is unju&s;t if he pa&s;&s;es by any: and then you exclaim again&s;t the horrible decree.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="023998_0027_0FC2ECF3C01D8698">Dear, dear &s;ir! O be not offended! for Chri&s;t's &s;ake be not ra&s;h! give your&s;elf to reading; &s;tudy the covenant of grace; down with your carnal rea|&s;oning; be a little child!
