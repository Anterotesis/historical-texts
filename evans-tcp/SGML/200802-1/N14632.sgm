<BIBL>1 KINGS, iii. 9, 10.</BIBL>
<Q>Give therefore thy &s;ervant an under&s;tanding heart, to judge thy people, that I may di&s;cern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy &s;o great a people? And the &s;peech plea&s;ed the Lord that Solomon bad a&s;ked this thing.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WISDOM is an e&s;&s;ential attribute of Jehovah: it con&s;i&s;ts in propo&s;ing the be&s;t ends, and pur&s;uing tho&s;e mea&s;ures which are be&s;t adapted to effect them. Perfect wi&s;dom is the prerogative of God alone; but he hath been plea&s;ed to impart it, in different mea&s;ures, to his rational creatures, and to make them capable of improvement therein: and the greater progre&s;s they make in the acqui&s;ition of true wi&s;dom, the more they re&s;emble the all-wi&s;e God. This is an object mo&s;t worthy of the pur&s;uit of every rational mind. To propo&s;e the glory of God as our chief end, to &s;eek the good of his creatures, and to pur&s;ue mea&s;ures which are be&s;t &s;itted to promote &s;o valuable purpo&s;es, is the highe&s;t <HI>human</HI> wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Wi&s;dom is principally needed in our &s;piritual concerns, as the&s;e are mo&s;t important. Our wi&s;dom, or folly, is mo&s;t di&s;covered in the regard, or di&s;regard, we &s;hew to God and his law. "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wi&s;dom: and the knowledge of the Holy is under|&s;tanding." However acute and di&s;cerning men may be in matters of le&s;s importance; yet, if there be a failure in that which is of highe&s;t concernment, the defect is &s;o e&s;&s;ential, that it &s;eems hard to pronounce them wi&s;e, when we take into view the whole &s;y&s;tem of their conduct. But however wi&s;dom is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary in our immediate concerns with
<PB N="4" REF="018566_0004_0FA7ADDEEF86DAD8">
God&mdash;however the greate&s;t wi&s;dom is di&s;covered in our regard and obe|dience to him; yet it is al&s;o n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce&s;&s;ary in every affair which relates to the pre&s;ent &s;tate; and indeed, even in every worldly matter, wi&s;dom obliges us to have &s;upreme regard to God, and in conducting them to &s;eek thee advancement of his declarative glory.</P>
<P>The nobler ends any one propo&s;es, and the more &s;uitable means he u&s;es to compa&s;s tho&s;e ends, the more wi&s;dom he di&s;covers. For one who acts in a low &s;phere, a &s;mall portion may &s;uffice to enable him to pro&s;ecute his bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;ucce&s;s; and as his &s;tation and employment ri&s;e in importance, in &s;uch proportion increa&s;es the nece&s;&s;ity of greater wi&s;dom in order to a proper and reputable di&s;charge of his duty. Great &s;kill and prudence are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in tho&s;e who are called to act in a public important character, where the happine&s;s of many de|pends on their wi&s;e and faithful management of affairs. To illu&s;trate this plain, though too much neglected, ob&s;ervation, I might adduce a long train of remarks on the duty of officers in the civil, military, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical departments; and point out many advantages, or mi&s;chiefs, which may ari&s;e to the public and to individuals, from a &s;uitable, or improper administration, in their re&s;pective places: but as the occa&s;ion of the day, and the pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture which &s;tands at the head of this di&s;cour&s;e, direct me to &s;peak more particularly of civil rulers, I &s;hall confine my ob&s;ervations principally to them.</P>
<P>The words of the text are the prayer of Solomon, the greate&s;t king, and the wi&s;e&s;t man, who ever lived: it was made &s;oon after his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne of I&s;rael: the &s;ub&s;tance of his prayer is, that he may have <HI>an under&s;tanding heart,</HI> that is, <HI>wi&s;dom and knowledge,</HI> as it is expre&s;&s;ed in the parallel pa&s;&s;age, 2 Chron. i. 10. The argument he urges to ob|tain his reque&s;t, is, that he may be able to judge the people of the Lord &mdash; "Give thy &s;ervant an under&s;tanding heart, to judge thy people; that I may di&s;cern between good and bad"&mdash;"Let me have wi&s;dom to rule thy people with equity and &s;kill, &s;upporting and duly encouraging tho&s;e who de&s;erve it, and inflicting condign puni&s;hment on the criminal." He also expre&s;&s;es a &s;en&s;e of his dependance on God for the wi&s;dom he needed&mdash;"For who is able to judge this thy &s;o great a people?" i. e. who, without thy gracious aid and direction, can &s;uitably conduct mat|ters, &s;o various and &s;o important, as come within the province of the ruler of thy people?&mdash;And in the preceding context, we find him
<PB N="5" REF="018566_0005_0FA7ADDFF57A1FE0">
&s;preading his cau&s;e before God, confe&s;&s;ing his weakne&s;s and want of &s;kill to direct him in the mid&s;t of &s;o great a people&mdash;"And now, O Lord my God, thou ha&s;t made thy &s;ervant king&mdash;and I am but a little child&mdash;I know not how to go out, or come in." Solomon was not a <HI>little child,</HI> as to age; for David had before called him a <HI>wi&s;e man</HI>:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kings, ii. 9.</NOTE> but a child in knowledge and experience about matters of government. He had newly entered on the admini&s;tration of government, and felt him&s;elf inadequate to the tru&s;t; he therefore &s;ought wi&s;dom from God: though doubtle&s;s he was, at the &s;ame time, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more wi&s;dom than thou&s;ands who, thinking them&s;elves &s;ufficient for all things, have not &s;ought coun&s;el from God, and have gone blindly on, leading the blind, till both they and their unhappy followers have been buried in the &s;ame ditch of ruin.</P>
<P>We here &s;ee the ideas Solomon had of the importance of a wi&s;e and prudent conduct in rulers, and where wi&s;dom is to be &s;ought. His &s;entiments and example are doubtle&s;s well worthy the con&s;ideration and imitation of all who are called to rule over others.</P>
<P>Our civil fathers will, I believe, join with me, when I &s;ay, they have as much need of wi&s;dom as had Solomon. Though the people they are called to rule are not &s;o great as was the Jewi&s;h nation; yet that nation, at the time we &s;peak of, were in unity among them&s;elves&mdash;their enemies were all &s;ubdued&mdash;they were in a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing condition&mdash;the nerves of government were &s;trong and vigorous: while we, at pre|&s;ent, (let the con&s;ideration humble us) are not &s;o well united among our&s;elves, and of con&s;equence the &s;inews of government are not &s;o firm and &s;table as might be wi&s;hed; add to this, that we are in our child|hood, with re&s;pect to our exi&s;tence as a State&mdash;our rulers are con&s;idered, by many, as unexperienced in politics&mdash;their mea&s;ures are therefore watched and &s;canned with more critical &s;everity. Hence ari&s;es greater difficulty in conducting to acceptance, and &s;o as mo&s;t effectually to pro|mote the public good. Hence al&s;o the great nece&s;&s;ity of care, wi&s;dom, and prudence, in every &s;tep they take. When the &s;ea is calm, the pilot's duty is ea&s;y and may be performed with le&s;s care and addre&s;s; but when a tempe&s;t ri&s;es, and the &s;hip is hurried on with irregular violence, he has need to look out with careful vigilance on every &s;ide, and to exert his utmo&s;t &s;kill, to &s;ave her from foundering, or at lea&s;t from much damage.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="018566_0006_0FA7ADE4A5A99618">It has been ob&s;erved, that wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;ts in propo&s;ing the be&s;t ends, and pur&s;uing the mo&s;t &s;uitable means to compa&s;s tho&s;e ends. It is equally plain, that the highe&s;t end any one can propo&s;e, is that for which he was principally de&s;igned, or received his exi&s;tence. Strictly &s;peaking, there is but one chief object, at which all &s;hould aim, viz. the promo|tion of God's glory. But in &s;ubordination, and with ultimate reference to this, there are other ends more immediately to be propo&s;ed by men, which are various according to their different characters.</P>
<P>The main end of a civil ruler, as &s;uch, is the well-being, peace, and happine&s;s, of community, or of the people at large; for this is the very end of his appointment&mdash;for this purpo&s;e he exi&s;ts, in that <HI>particular character.</HI> His wi&s;dom, in that character, then, appears in his choice and &s;teady pro&s;ecution of tho&s;e mea&s;ures which will mo&s;t effectually pro|mote the public good. To reach this object, it is nece&s;&s;ary that he be well acquainted with human nature in general. Since he is to rule over <HI>men,</HI> he mu&s;t have a competent knowledge of men, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate of imperfection, otherwi&s;e his mea&s;ures cannot be well cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Were mankind perfect in wi&s;dom and virtue, civil laws and rulers would be needle&s;s. From the vicious pa&s;&s;ions, the irregular lu&s;ts, the &s;elfi&s;h, encroaching di&s;po&s;ition of men, ari&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity of human laws and government; which are de&s;igned to regulate tho&s;e evils which are the natural offspring or &s;uch di&s;ordered minds. He, therefore, who is to make laws for men, mu&s;t be acquainted with the&s;e di&s;orders of hu|man nature, and mu&s;t have ob&s;erved the &s;everal evil con&s;equences they produce, that he may know what rules and penalties are be&s;t calculated to remedy tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs. But this is not the only light in which the ruler is to con&s;ider mankind: he &s;hould con&s;ider them as the &s;ame order and &s;pecies of beings with him&s;elf&mdash;equal by nature&mdash;having equal rights&mdash;of equal importance in the &s;ight of God&mdash;as rational creatures, who are to be bound by no laws which are not founded in rea&s;on&mdash;as accountable to God&mdash;under the ab&s;olute controul of the King of kings, and who cannot, without manife&s;t impropriety, and unfaithfulne&s;s to their Supreme Lord, yield an implicit and unlimited obedience to any &s;ubordinate power, or obey any laws which are repugnant to his: he mu&s;t al&s;o be acquainted with the genius and circum&s;tances of the parti|cular people over whom he rules, that his government may be adapted
<PB N="7" REF="018566_0007_0FA7ADE6738E5D40">
to &s;erve their intere&s;t, and maintain order; for the &s;ame laws and admi|ni&s;tration are not &s;uited to every people, or to the &s;ame people at all times.</P>
<P>It is the will of heaven, that there &s;hould be civil government in the world; and &s;ince all civil rulers, duly authori&s;ed to act as &s;uch, are ordained of God, under whom they have an inferior kind of dominion, for the pre&s;ervation of order among his creatures, and the promotion of their happine&s;s, it mu&s;t be their duty, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to pre|&s;erve the <HI>dignity</HI> of government: for otherwi&s;e they cannot an&s;wer the ends for which they were ordained&mdash;they will not be a terror to evil-workers; nor can they &s;uitably encourage and protect the good.</P>
<P>Law and authority held in contempt, are productive of more mi&s;chief than advantage. To prevent this evil, it is highly important that no laws be made but &s;uch as tend to the peace, protection, and happine&s;s, of the people; and that a &s;ufficient number, with adequate penalties, be made, to re&s;train tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to tran&s;gre&s;s; that every law be &s;everely examined as to its nature, and the manner of its operation; that it be ju&s;t, well adapted, and expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t unequivocal terms: for if a law be unju&s;t, or un&s;uitable, or &s;o expre&s;&s;ed as to admit of a double meaning, it will, mo&s;t probably, be di&s;regarded; the ma|kers of it will &s;ink into contempt; and people will be taught to rack their wits to elude the force of all law, by eva&s;ive con&s;truction. And as the law is the rule by which the executive powers mu&s;t be directed, if that be not good, all their proceedings mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be unju&s;t, or improper&mdash;the whole &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration be involved in intri|cate mazes of error&mdash;the very means appointed to pre&s;erve order, become irregular and confu&s;ed&mdash;and the complaint of Solomon be renewed&mdash;"I &s;aw under the &s;un the place of judgment, that wickedne&s;s was there; and the place of righteou&s;ne&s;s, that iniquity was there<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. iii.16.</NOTE>." And if, through human imperfection, or any other cau&s;e, laws have pa&s;&s;ed which do not an&s;wer the propo&s;ed end, but operate unju&s;tly, prudence and faithfulne&s;s demand their immediate repeal.</P>
<P>God only acts invariably right&mdash;it is proper to him alone to be <HI>of one mind:</HI> it is an honor to men to perceive and correct their mi&s;takes. Nor does the dignity of government depend more on the enacting good laws, than on their punctual execution. To pa&s;s laws which, from their own nature, and the nature of men, can never be executed, or not enforcing
<PB N="8" REF="018566_0008_0FA7ADE82E08B6B8">
s;uch as are practicable, will infallibly un&s;tring the nerves of govern|ment, and render it contemptible. Men become <HI>great</HI> offenders by <HI>habit.</HI> If &s;ome laws are made, the force of which may be ea&s;ily evaded, and others not put in practice, they pre&s;ently become <HI>bold</HI> in breaking over laws which they would not have dared to violate, and contrive a thou&s;and tricks to elude ju&s;tice, which they would never have thought of under a more wi&s;e and &s;teady admini&s;tration. In proof of this, our own ob&s;ervation, for a few years pa&s;t, is in the room of a thou&s;and ar|guments: and how it hath opened the flood-gates of vice, and let in the <HI>de&s;pi&s;ing of dominion and &s;peaking evil of dignities,</HI> and open wickedne&s;s, once &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the re&s;traint of law, the&s;e now prevailing vices loud|ly declare.</P>
<P>Arguing from the above principle, &s;hall we not conclude it a matter of high importance to a State newly erected, that they be peculiarly careful what laws they enact, and if any be found wrong, that they &s;oon repeal or alter them; if not, that they punctually execute them, that people may not get <HI>accu&s;tomed to tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion?</HI> For one may almo&s;t as well attempt to change the &s;kin of the Ethiopian, or wipe off the inde|lible &s;pot of the Leopard, as to form tho&s;e to good manners who have been accu&s;tomed to the contrary, or to make good &s;ubjects of tho&s;e who have been u&s;ed to di&s;obedience. It cannot be denied, indeed, that in the early dawn of a State, before it has acquired a good degree of con&s;i&s;t|ence and firmne&s;s, great difficulties may ari&s;e in this re&s;pect; and yet it is hard to &s;ay how it can otherwi&s;e ever become firm and vigorous.</P>
<P>Here, then, is a field for the di&s;play of the ruler's wi&s;dom, prudence, and &s;tability; and much depends on the manner in which he acquits him&s;elf. That the laws may be duly executed, it is nece&s;&s;ary that wi&s;e and &s;uitable per&s;ons be appointed for that purpo&s;e: it mu&s;t be an im|portant duty for tho&s;e to whom it belongs to appoint them, to "provide out of all the people, able men, &s;uch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetou&s;ne&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. xviii 21.</NOTE>:" Such will not be likely to betray their tru&s;t, and bring di&s;honour on government, and mi&s;ery on the people, by ignorance, or fear, or irre&s;olution, or unfaithfulne&s;s, or ba&s;e, &s;elfi&s;h ends. Every hand is not fit to wield the &s;word of ju&s;tice. There is &s;uch a thing as "<HI>folly</HI> &s;et in great dignity, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. x. 5, 6.</NOTE>:" and <HI>a great evil</HI> it is: may experience never teach us haw great!</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="018566_0009_0FA7ADE8B857FEF8">If the appointment of executive rulers be a matter of &s;uch con&s;e|quence, <HI>their</HI> duty mu&s;t be important. While they &s;it in the &s;eat of judgment, impartial ju&s;tice mu&s;t mark all their proceedings: the cau&s;e of the poor mu&s;t not be de&s;pi&s;ed, nor a mi&s;placed pity indulged towards the man in low e&s;tate; nor may da&s;tardly fear, or fawning flattery, in|fluence their proceedings with re&s;pect to the rich and powerful; nor may &s;elf-intere&s;ted views be ca&s;t into the balance in either ca&s;e: uninfluenced ju&s;tice, proceeding from the merits of the cau&s;e, mu&s;t be portrayed on every deci&s;ion; for <HI>the judgment is God's</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. i. 17.</NOTE>. This is the command of our God, "Ye &s;hall do no unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in judgment; thou &s;halt not re&s;pect the per&s;on of the poor, nor honor the per&s;on of the mighty; but in righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;halt thou judge thy neighbour<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Levit. xix 15.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>To pre&s;erve a proper air of dignity, every ruler, legislative or ex|ecutive, mu&s;t engage in the pubic affairs of his office with great gravity, &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;olemnity; with calm attention mu&s;t be deliberate on all public mea&s;ures; and firmly fixed n a well-formed purpo&s;e, pur&s;ue it with inflexible &s;tability. The man who is ever wavering and &s;hifting his ground, is like a wave of the &s;ea, and as little to be depended on&mdash;&s;hews that he never acts from a deliberate, well-directed judgment&mdash;all his mea&s;ures, like him&s;elf, are incon&s;i&s;tent, incoherent, jarring and oppo&s;ite one to the other: and what will be the con&s;equence of this in a ruler, is obvious to every mind or di&s;cernment. Whatever appears light, trifling, or un&s;uitable in the conduct of a public officer, detracts from his dignity, and begets light ideas of the man, in the minds of others, who watch all his conduct: and from de&s;pi&s;ing the ruler, to de&s;pi&s;ing the law, is an ea&s;y tran&s;ition.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame view, I may mention the nece&s;&s;ity of fulfilling <HI>public engagements.</HI> The debts of government, as well as of private per&s;ons, &s;hould be punctually di&s;charged, according to the true meaning of the contract. Any appearance of fraud, or want of care and attention herein, will produce much evil in a State.</P>
<P>Public bodies &s;hould be examples of ju&s;tice and punctuality; for mo&s;t people look to them as examples, and think them&s;elves fairly ju&s;|tified if they do not exceed them in &s;lackne&s;s. If many are not mi&s;ta|ken, a failure in this point hath much le&s;&s;ened the dignity, and weak|ened the hands of government, in neighbouring States&mdash;promi&s;es of
<PB N="10" REF="018566_0010_0FA7ADE96F21CBC0">
money having been made at a fixed time, when it has not appeared that they had a rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of obtaining it; and when the time hath elap&s;ed, they have not &s;o much as provided ways and means to make payment&mdash;till none were wilting to tru&s;t their money, or enter into &s;er|vice on public &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>When individuals cannot obtain the debts ju&s;tly due to them from the State, they think them&s;elves injured&mdash;di&s;contents ari&s;e&mdash;rulers are evil &s;poken of, and government falls into contempt. But there are other rea&s;ons why public debts &s;hould be di&s;charged&mdash;ju&s;tice requires it&mdash;the law of God requires it. Do not the &s;ame laws of equity which oblige individuals to pay each other their dues, equally bind public bodies? The law of God is plain, "Withhold not good from tho&s;e to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. iii. 27.</NOTE>." And where &s;ervice is done by tho&s;e who are poor, and depend on their labour for &s;upport, the law is more particular: "Thou &s;halt not oppre&s;s an hired &s;ervant, who is poor and needy; at his day thou &s;halt give him his hire, neither &s;hall the fun go down upon it; for he is poor, and &s;itteth his heart upon it&mdash;le&s;t he cry again&s;t thee unto the Lord, and it be &s;in unto thee:" "Thou &s;halt not defraud thy neighbour, nor rob him; the wages of him who is hired &s;hall not abide with thee all night until the morning<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxiv. 14, 15. Levit. xix. 13.</NOTE>." The&s;e rules will apply in the ca&s;e of many debts due from the public, and oblige to the payment of them by the time &s;tipulated. Ju&s;tice requires that every one receive his dues from the State in &s;ea&s;on&mdash;the public good, and the law of God, require it: and is it not probable, that a want of due attention in this matter, has had an evil tendency to corrupt the morals of the people&mdash;has encouraged them in acts of fraud and breach of faith? yea, has it not <HI>become &s;in</HI> to the land? It may, doubtle&s;s, happen, through the flow operation of public mea&s;ures, that punctual payments cannot be made, though there was a rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of it, at the time of engagement: but whether it has not often been for want of &s;ufficient and &s;ea&s;onable attention, is matter of ju&s;t inquiry.</P>
<P>Another important branch of the ruler's duty, and mark of his wi&s;|dom, is, the promotion of u&s;eful learning. This is nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s, and even to the long exi&s;tence, of a free State. A blind man is not more ea&s;ily robbed of his trea&s;ure, than an ignorant people

of their liberty. The &s;lavery of a people, once free, generally ari&s;es from their own ignorance on one hand, and the lu&s;t of domination and greatne&s;s in their rulers on the other. Care will be taken to guard again&s;t this evil, by tho&s;e rulers who wi&s;h well to the liberty and welfare of their people. They will take care to promote every kind of u&s;eful knowledge; unle&s;s they be ignorant them&s;elves, and imbibe the ab&s;urd opinion of &s;ome, who think &s;uch mo&s;t fit to lead in church and &s;tate&s;&mdash;and then what marvel if they, and the people unhappily led by them, are both involved in the wretched fate of blind guides and their fol|lowers?</P>
<P>The education of youth, and encouragement of &s;uperior genius, are objects of high importance, and de&s;erve the &s;pecial attention of rulers. E&s;tabli&s;hing and endowing &s;ocieties for that purpo&s;e, is a &s;ervice which merits the thanks and applau&s;e of the public. For want of time and ability, it is not expected that the body of the people will follow the paths of &s;cience, &s;o as to attain great literary acquirements; yet a cer|tain degree of knowledge diffu&s;ed through a State, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve liberty and good government. Nothing, but the religion of Je&s;us, is of equal importance with the good education of youth, and the promotion of knowledge. Power and wealth may &s;upport tyranny and de&s;poti&s;m; but liberty and order are not to be pre&s;erved without learning and virtue. <HI>Ignorance</HI> is a natural &s;ource of error, &s;elf-conceit, and contracted, groveling &s;entiments: and how difficult it is to rule people of &s;uch a ca&s;t, tho&s;e can be&s;t tell, who have made the experiment: more <HI>wi&s;e in their own conceit than &s;even men who can render a rea&s;on,</HI> they ever find fault with public men and mea&s;ures, and thwart them all in their power. An <HI>ignorant patriot</HI> is a <HI>rarity</HI> in the world: from their contracted &s;entiments ari&s;e di&s;content and murmurs, if at any time the public liberty and &s;afety demand &s;pecial exertion and increa&s;ed charge, and their unmeaning tongues utter continual anathema's again&s;t tho&s;e mea&s;ures which their narrow minds cannot comprehend. Such will be the ca&s;e with the&s;e people, while they have &s;ome notions of liberty, and actually retain a degree of it: but it de&s;igning, ambitious, and artful men, are di&s;po&s;ed to ri&s;e on the ruins of their freedom, they &s;ee not the danger until it is too late; or, if they do, know not the proper means to avoid it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="018566_0012_0FA7ADED5EB16818">May I not add, as another very important part of the care and duty of a ruler, the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of vice and immorality, the promotion of moral virtue, the good of the church, and the intere&s;ts of religion in general? Rulers &s;hould be a <HI>terror to evil works</HI>&mdash;they &s;hould <HI>di&s;cern,</HI> and make a <HI>difference between good and bad</HI>&mdash;they &s;hould &s;o conduct in their &s;everal places, that the vicious may not only be a&s;hamed, but afraid to hold up their heads: nor is their duty in this matter merely negative&mdash;they mu&s;t not only &s;uppre&s;s vice, but encourage virtue by their example, and by laws &s;o framed and executed that they may tend to meliorate the morals of the people. The church of God is his pe|culiar trea&s;ure, and he will doubtle&s;s protect her again&s;t all the efforts of devils, and men influenced from beneath. The ruler's care is not needed to pre&s;erve her <HI>being,</HI> as if &s;he could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without; for God is engaged to pre&s;erve her from de&s;truction: but that his care is not needed to her <HI>well-being,</HI> in any &s;en&s;e, I think, is not quite lo plain. The church is, indeed, an e&s;tabli&s;hment entirely di&s;tinct from civil go|vernment&mdash;&s;o is a &s;eminary of learning; but does it thence follow, that they have no dependance on each other; or that, though they may exi&s;t &s;eparately, they are like equally to flouri&s;h without any connection or mutual &s;upport afforded to each other? Is there any incon&s;i&s;tence in &s;uppo&s;ing that God, who has erected a church in the world, and has al&s;o ordained civil government, hath de&s;igned they &s;hould be fellow|helpers one to the other? or that magi&s;trates in their place, as well as mini&s;ters, &s;hould be u&s;ed as in&s;truments in promoting the &s;ame cau&s;e? it is not &s;uppo&s;ed that they have any right to interfere in impo&s;ing ar|ticles of faith, particular modes or wor&s;hip, and things of a like na|ture&mdash;God only is Lord of con&s;cience&mdash;every one has an undoubted right to choo&s;e that religion and mode of wor&s;hip which to him appears mo&s;t agreeable to the word of God, unle&s;s it be &s;uch as evidently tends to de&s;troy civil peace and government; in that ca&s;e no one ought to be <HI>tolerated</HI>&mdash;&s;elf-pre&s;ervation forbids it&mdash;and we know they have not the approbation of God, who, under pretence of &s;erving him, would nul|lify his ordinance. But the church, while militant, mu&s;t have her temporal intere&s;t: in the&s;e, I think, &s;he has an undoubted right to the protection of the civil magi&s;trate&mdash;he &s;hould protect chri&s;tian &s;ocieties in the peaceable enjoyment of all their rights, derived from the go&s;pel charter&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;hould take care that they be not di&s;turbed and infringed

on, in their wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline, and ordinances, by di&s;orderly per&s;ons, who may &s;eek to impede or mole&s;t them&mdash;they &s;hould encourage and provide for the &s;upport of public wor&s;hip, and tho&s;e who mini&s;ter in &s;acred things.</P>
<P>But, as the propriety of any mea&s;ures taken by civil rulers, in matters of religion, either for the &s;upport of wor&s;hip, or mini&s;ters, is di&s;puted by many &s;erious per&s;ons, permit me to offer two or three con&s;iderations on this point.</P>
<P>That provi&s;ion was made for upholding the pubic wor&s;hip of God, and the &s;upport of his prie&s;ts, under the Jewi&s;h oeconomy, and that their pious rulers made it their care to &s;ee that people performed their duty in this re&s;pect, and were approved of God in it, I &s;uppo&s;e will not be denied. Mo&s;es, the friend of God, and ruler of his people, was very a&s;&s;iduous in preserving the honour and &s;upporting the wor&s;hip of God&mdash;"Ye &s;hall keep my &s;abbaths, and reverence my &s;anctuary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Levit. xix. 30.</NOTE>," &s;ays he, in the name of the Lord: he was careful to &s;ee it done&mdash;he made ample provi&s;ion for the &s;upport of tho&s;e who mini&s;tered before the Lord: this he did by the immediate direction of God. Good Hezekiah hath left a &s;imilar example, and is commended as having <HI>wrought that which was good, and rights, and truth, before the Lord his God</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. xxxi. 2, 4, 20.</NOTE>. From hence I would argue, that the thing is <HI>right in it&s;elf,</HI> and acceptable to God, that rulers &s;hould interpo&s;e in the&s;e matters: for, whatever pecu|liarities there were in the Jewi&s;h polity and di&s;pen&s;ation, God never ap|pointed any thing, or approved it, which in its nature was wrong, or un&s;uitable, or infringed on the rights of con&s;cience; it is impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould do either&mdash;he is perfect&mdash;his will is a law to con&s;cience. In a government, under laws of God's own appointment, the <HI>ruler</HI> was to attend to the&s;e things: why &s;hould not that be con&s;idered as a good example for rulers now? why &s;hould not they, in doing the &s;ame things, be thought to do that which is <HI>good and right</HI> before God <HI>now</HI> as well as then? the church might have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, the wor&s;hip and mini&s;ters of God &s;upported, without them then, as well as now; but he &s;aw fit to u&s;e them as in&s;truments to a&s;&s;i&s;t his church in the&s;e matters. This ar|gument receives additional force from Paul's di&s;cour&s;e, 1 Corinth. ix. "Know ye not, that tho&s;e who mini&s;ter about holy things live of the things of the temple? and tho&s;e who wait at the altar are partakers with

the altar? Even to hath the Lord ordained that tho&s;e who preach the go&s;pel &s;hould live of the go&s;pel." Q. D. You may know from what was God's will under the old te&s;tament, what is his will under the new; he had his mimi&s;ters then, and he appointed them a &s;upport: <HI>Even &s;o</HI> hath he ordained with re&s;pect to his mini&s;ters under the go&s;pel&mdash;they &s;hall have their &s;upport, though not in the &s;ame way in which the Jewi&s;h prie&s;ts were provided for, by the offerings of the Lord, they having cea&s;ed; yet they have a title to a maintenance, as a reward for their labour, and that they may be devoted to the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>If it be ju&s;t rea&s;oning in this ca&s;e, to infer from what was God's will under the old te&s;tament, what is his will under the new, as the apo&s;tle does, why may we not &s;ay without he&s;itation, that &s;ince it appears to have been his will then, that civil rulers &s;hould concern theim&s;elves in the&s;e affairs, therefore it is his will now? why &s;hould they not make laws which &s;hall &s;ecure the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t in their ju&s;t does? why &s;hould they not enjoin the upholding of public wor&s;hip? why &s;hould not the church expect and receive their aid <HI>now,</HI> as well as then?&mdash; e&s;pecially when, among many valuable favours promi&s;ed to her under the go&s;pel, greater than &s;he enjoyed under the old di&s;pen&s;ation, this is mentioned as one, viz. the &s;upport &s;he &s;hould receive from the rulers of the Gentiles, whole wealth and power &s;hould be employed for her good: "Kings &s;hall be thy nur&s;ing rathers, and their queens thy nur|&s;ing mothers"&mdash;"Thou &s;halt &s;uck the brea&s;ts of kings, and thuo &s;halt know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;iah xlix 23 &amp; 60.xvi.</NOTE> &amp;c. What is the amount of this le&s;s than that it is the duty of the ruler to be friend the church and the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and take care for their encou|ragement and &s;upport, and &s;ecurity in all their ju&s;t rights? Is it the duty of a nur&s;ing father to cheri&s;h, &s;upport, and protect the child, to be careful and tender of its intere&s;t, to defend it from injury, to main|tain all its rights? and has the go&s;pel church a promi&s;e of the like care from the ruler? Judge them, whether Chri&s;t is not plea&s;ed when the civil arm takes her under its protection, and affords her that help which he hath promi&s;ed her from it?&mdash;Let the ruler con&s;ider this, and learn his duty <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The above arguments, to prove it the ruler's duty to take care of the intere&s;t of religion, &amp;c. have been taken only from &s;cripture. I beg leave here here further to &s;ugge&s;t, that if it be his duty to pur&s;ue every mea&s;ure which tends to the peace and good order of &s;ociety, then it is his duty thus to provide for the &s;upport of the public wor&s;hip of God, &amp;c. for experience abundantly teaches, that there is mo&s;t peace and good order, generally, in tho&s;e &s;ocieties where the go&s;pel is preached and regularly attended. If the preaching of the go&s;pel tends to reform the morals of people, and people of good morals are be&s;t members of &s;ociety, it can't be denied that it is of importance to every com|munity, that the go&s;pel be regularly preached, and the preachers of it encou|raged by a &s;upport which &s;hall enable them to attend to that work: and rulers &s;eek the peace and good order of &s;ociety, mu&s;t make due provi&s;ion for it. Nor can the plea of <HI>con&s;cience</HI> be rea&s;onably made again&s;t this:&mdash;How does it infringe on the rights of con&s;ceience, for the ruler to oblige people to tho&s;e outward acts of duty which God hath enjoined, and which are found needful for the good of &s;ociety? If he enjoins what is repugnant to the law of God&mdash; if he pre&s;cribes articles of faith, or modes of wor&s;hip, &amp;c. let him be oppo&s;ed: but if he finds outward acts of duty required in the word of God, which are highly for the benefit of community, how does he injure con&s;cience by obliging people to perform them? God has commanded that men &s;hould not &s;teal and rob one another, and no one thinks the rights of con&s;cience invaded when the ruler makes laws to enforce this command, or to puni&s;h the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of it&mdash;every one &s;ees that the good of &s;ociety requires it. God hath re&s;erved to him|&s;elf &s;uch a proportion of temporal goods which he hath lent us. as is &s;ufficient to uphold his wor&s;hip&mdash;with-holding that, is robbing him; Mal. iii.8. "Ye have robbed me in tithes and offerings"&mdash;they with-held what God had ap|pointed for the &s;upport of his prie&s;ts and wor&s;hip: this he calls <HI>robbing</HI> him. Now how are the rights of con&s;ceience invaded, if the ruler makes laws to pre|vent their robbing God in this with-holding what he claims for &s;upport of his wor&s;hip, when at the &s;ame time the public good requires it, more than when he enforces, by law, the command not to rob men?</NOTE>.</P>

And while you tran&s;act matters or &s;tate, and feel their weighty importance, as every faithful ruler will, who con&s;iders how much the happine&s;s of a whole community depends on his conduct, you will not forget to make frequent application to the throne of grace, and earne&s;t|ly

While you are honoured with the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in you by a free people, we doubt not you will remember that true honour con&s;i&s;ts not merely in an elevated &s;tation; but in a wi&s;e and faithful di&s;charge of the duties of that &s;tation. We expect, yea, God expects of you, that you be ju&s;t, ruling in his fear&mdash;that you enact ju&s;t and good laws, and &s;ee that they be well ex|ecuted&mdash;that you pay great deference to the laws your&s;elves; to your own and the laws of God.

The powers which be are ordained of God, and to re&s;i&s;t them in the regular di&s;charge of their duty, is to re&s;i&s;t the ordinance of God, and highly provoking to him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Romans xiii.1, 2.</NOTE>. We mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject not only for fear of the wrath which they will execute on us, but for con&s;ceience &s;ake. It is a mo&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent and di&s;tracted piece of conduct, to &s;et up rulers, and then di&s;obey their ju&s;t &amp; needful laws; or to condemn their mea&s;ures before we are well acquaint|ed with the rea&s;ons of their proceedings. To <HI>de&s;pi&s;e dominion, and &s;peak evil of dignities, and things they know not,</HI> are reckoned among tho&s;e things which compo&s;e the mo&s;t hateful character<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jude, 8 &amp; 10.</NOTE>. Rulers are <HI>mini&s;ters

of God, for our good</HI>; and while faithful to their tru&s;t, <HI>attend continually upon this very thing&mdash;for this cau&s;e pay ye tribute al&s;o.</HI> It is rea&s;onable that tho&s;e who devote their time and talents to &s;erve the public, &s;hould have an honorable reward: If <HI>wi&s;dom and knowledge</HI> be nece&s;&s;ary quali|fications in rulers, they ought to have a generous &s;upport; for much time, labour, and expence, are needful thus to qualify them. It be|comes &s;ubjects to &s;trengthen the hands of their rulers; and not unne|ce&s;&s;arily increa&s;e the weight of their burdens. While they rule in equity, and give us opportunity, it becomes us to <HI>live a quiet and peaceable life in godline&s;s and hone&s;ty</HI>: it becomes us to offer up prayers and &s;upplica|tions, with thank&s;giving, for tho&s;e in authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii.1, 2.</NOTE>. We have duties to di&s;charge towards the ruler, as well as he towards us. We are as much bound to aid and obey the ruler, as he is to rule us in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Let us then all, rulers and &s;ubjects, &s;tudy to di&s;charge with faithful|ne&s;s the reciprocal duties we owe to each other: in every relation let us act with a &s;upreme regard to God, before who&s;e awful bar we mu&s;t all meet, ere long, and &s;tand, undi&s;tingui&s;hed by any pre&s;ent titles, or badges of &s;uperiority, to receive a reward according to the deeds done in the body. Let us ever bear on mind our near connection with the eternal world, to which we are ha&s;ting as fa&s;t as the nimble wing of time can carry us. And while we live together on earth, live in peace and unity, in conformity to the God of peace; till, purified by his grace from all tho&s;e corruptions which cau&s;e &s;o much &s;trife, confu&s;ion, and mi&s;ery, in this life, we &s;hall brighten into his perfect and glorious image, and unite together in realms of light, of eternal peace and ho|line&s;s&mdash;there may the love of God &s;well our hearts, and his high prai&s;es dwell on our tongues for ever and ever&mdash;through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, to whom be eternal glory.</P>
