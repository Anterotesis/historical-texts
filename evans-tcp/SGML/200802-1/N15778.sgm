<P>FROM every channel of public intelligence we learn, that there is a di&s;po&s;ition in many of the legi&s;|latures of this country, to emit bills of credit by au|thority of government, and to make them in &s;ome mea|&s;ure at lea&s;t, or in &s;ome ca&s;es, a legal tender for debts already contracted. This is a matter of great deli|cacy and danger. It has occa&s;ioned a controver&s;ial di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject in pamphlets and periodical publications. A few plau&s;ible things, and but a few that de&s;erve that character, have been publi&s;hed in defence of the mea&s;ure. Many &s;hrewd and &s;en&s;ible things have been offered again&s;t it; but even the&s;e la&s;t have not been &s;o connected and &s;atisfying, as they might and ought to have been. Some of the pieces have been verbo&s;e and declamatory, with ma|ny repetitions; others have been full of antithe&s;es, quaint &s;ayings, and wittici&s;ms, which have no great tendency to convince or per&s;uade; and &s;ome have been mingled with the local and party politics of particular &s;tates. Perhaps the&s;e different ways of writing may be very proper for &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of readers, and have a good effect; but there are certainly others who would require a different treatment, becau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> are owing not to deceitful <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> erroneous judgment.

done upon the &s;ubject by di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate rea&s;oning. By this I mean, endeavouring to carry the matter back to its fir&s;t principles, to explain them in &s;o &s;imple a man|ner, as that the unlearned may under&s;tand them; and then to deduce the practical con&s;equences with the general theory full in view.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to reach my purpo&s;e, without &s;ay|ing many things which in a &s;eparate and detached manner have been &s;aid by others; but this mu&s;t be forgiven me; becau&s;e I mean to lay the whole &s;y&s;tem before the reader, and every part in its proper order and connection. Let us then begin by con&s;idering what gave ri&s;e to money, and what is its nature and u&s;e? If there were but one man upon the earth, he would be obliged to prepare a hut for his habitation, to dig roots for his &s;u&s;tenance, to provide &s;kins or fig-leaves for his covering, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> in &s;hort, to do every thing for him&s;elf. If but one or two more were joined with him, it would &s;oon be found that one of them would be more &s;kilful in one &s;ort of work, and another in a different; &s;o that common intere&s;t would direct them, each to apply his indu&s;try to what he could do be&s;t and &s;oone&s;t; to communicate the &s;ur|plus of what he needed him&s;elf of that &s;ort of work to the others, and receive of their &s;urplus in return. This directly points out to us, that a barter of com|modities, or communication of the fruits of indu&s;try, is the fir&s;t principle, or rather indeed con&s;titutes the e&s;&s;ence, of commerce. As &s;ociety increa&s;es, the par|tition of employments is greatly diver&s;ified; but &s;till
<PB N="3" REF="020154_0005_0FADF3E45AD58D78">
the fruits of well directed indu&s;try, or the things nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful in life, are what only can be called wealth.</P>
<P>IN e&s;tabli&s;hing a mutual exchange of the&s;e, the fir&s;t thing nece&s;&s;ary is a &s;tandard of computation, or common mea&s;ure, by which to e&s;timate the &s;everal commodities that may be offered to &s;ale, or may be de&s;ired by purcha&s;ers. Without this it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that the barter of commodities is liable to very great difficulties, and very great errors. This &s;tandard or common mea&s;ure mu&s;t be &s;omething that is well known to both parties, and of general or common u&s;e. As the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays in any thing are generally rude and imperfect; &s;o I think it appears from the monuments of remote antiquity, that in the early &s;tages of &s;ociety, cattle were the fir&s;t things made u&s;e of as a &s;tandard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Servius Tullius, one of the Roman kings, is &s;aid to have &s;tamped &s;ome pieces with the figure of cattle; an ox, or a &s;heep. This was as much as to &s;ay, this piece is of the value of an ox or a &s;heep. Hence it is &s;aid the Roman word <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> comes from <HI>pecus,</HI> cattle. Others have thought it was from the u&s;e of leather for money, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.</HI> But the fir&s;t etymology &s;eems to be the be&s;t. See a &s;ub&s;equent note.</NOTE>. But it would &s;oon appear that this was a mo&s;t inaccurate mea&s;ure; becau&s;e one ox might be as good as two, from &s;ize, fatne&s;s, or other circum&s;tances. Therefore in place of this &s;ucceeded mea&s;ures both of dry and liquid, that is, corn, wine, and oil. The fir&s;t of the&s;e was of all others the mo&s;t proper &s;tandard, becau&s;e univer&s;ally nece&s;&s;ary, and
<PB N="4" REF="020154_0006_0FADF3E595D81250">
liable to little variation. Men, upon an average, would probably eat nearly the &s;ame quantity in the mo&s;t di&s;tant ages and countries. It &s;eems to me, that this circum&s;tance of a &s;tandard of computation being nece&s;&s;ary in commerce, and the fir&s;t thing nece&s;&s;ary, has been in a great mea&s;ure overlooked by mo&s;t wri|ters on money, or rather it has been confounded with the &s;tandard value of the &s;ign, although e&s;&s;entially different from it; and the equivocal u&s;e of the terms has occa&s;ioned great confu&s;ion. I mu&s;t however ob|&s;erve, not only that this mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be taken in, but that if we confine our&s;elves to a &s;tandard of com|putation only, &s;ome known commodity, as mea&s;ured grain, is better, and more intelligible and unalterable than any money whatever, that either has been or will be made. The great alteration in the value of gold and &s;ilver is known to every per&s;on who has but dipped into hi&s;tory; and indeed is known to many, even by memory, in this country, &s;ince its fir&s;t &s;ettle|ment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are two e&s;tates near one of the colleges in Scotland, which were originally taxed an equal number of bolls of grain (a boll is about 6 bu&s;hels) to that in&s;titution. In very remote times, it plea&s;ed the proprietor of one of the&s;e e&s;tates, with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the college, to convert the payment into money, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to the then current value, which was a groat or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> for a boll.

<P><PB N="5" REF="020154_0007_0FADF3E5F08B5288">
BUT after a &s;tandard of computation had been a|greed upon, in commerce even of the mo&s;t mo|derate extent, &s;omething farther would be ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary. The actual and immediate barter of commodities could in few in&s;tances take place. A man might have the thing that I wanted to pur|cha&s;e, but he might not need or de&s;ire what I was willing to give for it. Another might want what I had to &s;pare, but not have what I wanted to pur|cha&s;e with it. Be&s;ides, bulky or peri&s;hable commo|dities could not be carried about at an uncertainty, or with &s;afety. Therefore, it became very early nece&s;|&s;ary, that there &s;hould be &s;ome &s;ign or &s;igns agreed upon, which &s;hould repre&s;ent the ab&s;ent commodi|ties, or rather &s;hould repre&s;ent the &s;tandard of com|putation, in all its divi&s;ions and multiplications. The&s;e &s;igns mu&s;t be &s;uch as could ea&s;ily be carried about, and therefore could be readily applied to every kind of tran&s;actions, which were connected with the com|mutation of property.</P>
<P>LET us examine the nature and meaning of the&s;e &s;igns more particularly. They are of the nature of a tally, that is to &s;ay, they are intended to mark and a&s;certain a fact. Now the fact is, that the per&s;on
<PB N="6" REF="020154_0008_0FADF3E6A93506C8">
who can &s;hew tho&s;e &s;igns, having purcha&s;ed them by his goods or indu&s;try, is entitled to receive from &s;omebody, a certain value, or to a certain amount, which they &s;pecify, of the &s;tandard of computation. They have always a reference to the &s;tandard of com|putation, and at la&s;t, by that known reference, the di&s;tinction between them and the &s;tandard of compu|tation is lo&s;t, and they become a &s;econdary &s;tandard of computation them&s;elves. Thus a piece is intended at fir&s;t to be of the value of a mea&s;ure of grain; but at la&s;t men come to make their bargain by the num|ber of pieces in&s;tead of the number of mea&s;ures; u&s;|ing the &s;ign for the thing &s;ignified. Thus al&s;o, &s;ome|times at lea&s;t, an ideal mea&s;ure, generated by the other two, comes to be the &s;tandard of computation; as in England, the pound &s;terling is the money unit, though there be no coin preci&s;ely corre&s;ponding to it. This is &s;ufficient to explain the relation of the &s;ign to the &s;tandard of computation, and at la&s;t, if I may &s;peak &s;o, its con&s;olidation with it.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid above, that the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;ign is entitled to receive a certain value from <HI>&s;ome|body.</HI> The rea&s;on of this is, becau&s;e his debtor is not the &s;ame in every &s;tate of things. If we con&s;i|der the &s;ign as given from one individual to another, it is of the nature of a promi&s;&s;ory note, and is a con|fe&s;&s;ion of having received &s;o much property. Pro|bably there were often &s;uch &s;igns or tokens given in the infancy of &s;ociety; and it would then &s;ignify, that if the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">eller were to come again, at a di&s;tance of
<PB N="7" REF="020154_0009_0FADF3E74DDC2C08">
time, and find the buyer in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch goods as he wanted, he would be entitled to receive the a|mount of the &s;ign or token that had been given him. But the convenience of u&s;ing &s;igns is &s;o great, that it would immediately occa&s;ion their being made u&s;e of by general con&s;ent, expre&s;s or implied; and at la&s;t, the matter would be taken under the direction of the ruling part of the community. In both ca&s;es, but e&s;pecially in this la&s;t, the &s;ociety becomes bound to the per&s;on who receives the &s;igns for his goods or indu&s;try, that they &s;hall be to him of the value that they &s;pecify. I will afterwards &s;how, that this was not the fir&s;t but the la&s;t &s;tep taken in the u&s;e of &s;igns, and give the rea&s;ons for it; but it is proper to men|tion it now, when we are con&s;idering the nature and u&s;e of &s;igns in that &s;ingle view.</P>
<P>LET it be ob&s;erved here, that as it was before &s;aid, if we aim at no more than a &s;tandard of computation &s;ome commodities are not only as good but better than any money, &s;o if we confine our&s;elves to a &s;ign only &s;eparate from a &s;tandard, many things that might be named are not only as good, but far better than either the &s;tandard it&s;elf, or what we call money, becau&s;e they are much more ea&s;ily reckoned, tran&s;|ported and concealed. This appears particularly from the &s;tate of &s;igns in modern times, after &s;o much experience and improvement has taken place. For if we can guard &s;ufficiently again&s;t the dangers to which they are expo&s;ed, &s;igns inconceivably faci|litate commerce. We can put any value we ple<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="8" REF="020154_0010_0FADF3E8F0846CE8">
in an obligation written on a few inches of paper, and can &s;end it over the world it&s;elf at very little ex|pence, and conceal it &s;o ea&s;ily that there &s;hall be no danger of its being taken from us.</P>
<P>BUT it mu&s;t have appeared, and did &s;peedily ap|pear, that all mere &s;igns labour under an e&s;&s;ential de|fect. They depend ultimately on the faith or credit of the per&s;ons u&s;ing or an&s;werable for them. Now whether the&s;e be individuals or the multitude by ge|neral cu&s;tom and implied con&s;ent, or even the ruling part of the &s;ociety, there is very great uncertainty. Therefore &s;omething farther is nece&s;&s;ary to make a a complete &s;ymbol or medium of general commerce, and that is, <HI>a pledge</HI> or &s;tandard of value that may be a &s;ecurity or equivalent for the thing given for it, and at all times be &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e a like value of any thing that may be needed by him that holds it. An ab&s;ent commodity well known, or even an idea well under&s;tood, may be a &s;tandard of computa|tion and common mea&s;ure; any thing almo&s;t what|ever may be a &s;ign, though, &s;ince the art of writing has been known, paper is the be&s;t, but both are e&s;|&s;entially defective; there is wanting a value in the &s;ign, that &s;hall give not only a promi&s;e or obligation, but actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of property for property.</P>
<P>THE mentioning of the&s;e three di&s;tinct ends to be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> by the medium of commerce, and illu&s;trating them &s;eparately, was not to convey the idea that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> three &s;teps of this kind taken at a di&s;tance of time from each other, or that men fir&s;t continued
<PB N="9" REF="020154_0011_0FADF3E98DEBA4F8">
long to deal in gro&s;s barter; and after that invented &s;igns, and were content with them for another peri|od; and at la&s;t perfected the plan, by getting &s;igns po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of real value. On the contrary, it was to &s;hew that any thing u&s;ed as a medium of univer&s;al or general commerce, mu&s;t be able to &s;erve all the three forementioned purpo&s;es; and that if there is any production <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> nature or fabrication of art, that can unite the whole, at lea&s;t as far as they are capable of being united, this mu&s;t be the great de&s;ideratum. Now it has been found in experience, that the pre|cious metals, e&s;pecially tho&s;e now called by that name, gold and &s;ilver, do an&s;wer all the three ends in a great degree. It cannot be denied that they have been u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e in fact from the earlie&s;t times, and through every nation in the old world; and indeed al&s;o in the new, with &s;uch exception only as will confirm the principles of the theory. If any man think that this has happened by accident, or through the whim or caprice of mankind, as one would &s;u&s;|pect from the language &s;ometimes u&s;ed in &s;peech and writing, he is greatly mi&s;taken. No effect of whim or accident ever was &s;o uniform or &s;o la&s;ting. The truth is, that the&s;e metals do po&s;&s;e&s;s in a degree &s;u|perior to every thing el&s;e, the qualities nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;es mentioned above.</P>
<P>THIS will appear to any impartial per&s;on who will con&s;ider, with a view to the preceding principles, what qualities a medium of general commerce ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s. It ought, then, to be (1.) valuable;
<PB N="10" REF="020154_0012_0FADF3ECB82A1CE0">
(2.) rare; (3.) portable; (4.) divi&s;ible; (5.) durable. Whoever will examine the matter with attention, mu&s;t perceive that any one of the&s;e qualities being wholly or greatly wanting, the &s;y&s;tem would be either entirely ruined or remarkably injured. Let us examine them &s;eparately.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT mu&s;t be <HI>valuable;</HI> that is to &s;ay, it mu&s;t have an intrin&s;ic worth in it&s;elf, in &s;ub&s;tance di&s;tinct from the form. By value or intrin&s;ic worth here, mu&s;t be under&s;tood preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing that gives to every other commodity its commercial value. Do you a&s;k what that is? I an&s;wer, its being either ne|ce&s;&s;ary or remarkably u&s;eful for the purpo&s;es of life in a &s;ocial &s;tate, or at lea&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o, and therefore the object of human de&s;ire. Without this it could be no more than a bare &s;ign; nor indeed &s;o u&s;eful in this view as many other &s;igns. But we want &s;omething that mu&s;t be not only a &s;tandard of com|putation, but a &s;tandard of value; and therefore ca|pable of being a pledge and &s;ecurity to the holder, for the property that he has exchanged for it. It is likely &s;ome will &s;ay, What is the intrin&s;ic value of gold and &s;ilver? They are not wealth; they are but the &s;ign or repre&s;entative of commodities. Superfi|cial philo&s;ophers, and even &s;ome men of good under|&s;tanding, not attending to the nature of currency, have really &s;aid &s;o. What is gold, &s;ay &s;ome, the value is all in the fancy; you can neither eat nor wear it; it will neither feed, clothe, nor warm you. Gold, &s;ay others, as to intrin&s;ic value, is not &s;o good
<PB N="11" REF="020154_0013_0FADF3EDF88B6B08">
as iron, which can be applied to many more u&s;eful purpo&s;es. The&s;e per&s;ons have not attended to the nature of commercial value, which is in a compound ratio of its u&s;e and &s;carcene&s;s. If iron were as rare as gold, it would probably be as valuable, perhaps more &s;o. How many in&s;tances are there of things, which, though a certain proportion of them is not on|ly valuable, but indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to life it&s;elf; yet which, from their abundance, have no commercial value at all. Take for examples air and water. Peo|ple do not bring the&s;e to market, becau&s;e they are in &s;uperabundant plenty. But let any circum&s;tances take place that render them rare, and difficult to be obtained, and their value immediately ri&s;es above all computation. What would one of tho&s;e who were &s;tifled in the black hole at Calcutta have given to get but near a window for a little air? And what will the crew of a &s;hip at &s;ea, who&s;e water is nearly expended, give for a fre&s;h &s;upply?</P>
<P>GOLD and &s;ilver have intrin&s;ic value as metals, be|cau&s;e from their ductility, durability, and other qua|lities, they are exceedingly fit for dome&s;tic uten&s;ils, and many purpo&s;es in life. This circum&s;tance was the foundation of their u&s;e as a medium of commerce, and was in&s;eparable from it. No clearer proof of this can be adduced, than that in the earlie&s;t times, even when u&s;ed in commerce, they were weighed be|fore they were divided into &s;maller pieces, and pa&s;&s;ed in tale. They mu&s;t &s;urely then have had intrin&s;ic va|lue; for their value was in proportion to their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="12" REF="020154_0014_0FADF3EF54925B80">
quantity. This circum&s;tance as a &s;ign made them wor&s;e, but as a valuable metal made them better. The &s;ame thing appears as clearly from the practice of modern times. Even when they are taken into the management of the rulers of &s;ociety, and &s;tamped un|der various denominations, there mu&s;t be an exact regard had to their commercial value. The &s;tamp upon them is the <HI>&s;ign,</HI> the intrin&s;ic worth of the me|tal is the <HI>value.</HI> It is now found, and admitted by every nation, that they mu&s;t give to every piece that denomination and value in legal currency, that it bears in bullion; and if any do otherwi&s;e, there is neither authority nor force &s;ufficient to make it pa&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An author on this &s;ubject in a pamphlet lately publi&s;hed &s;ays, "The value of the precious metals is however enhanced by their peculiar aptitude to perform the office of an univer|&s;al money beyond any real inherent value they po&s;&s;e&s;s. This extrin&s;ic value of gold and &s;ilver, which belongs to them un|der the modification of coin or bullion, is totally di&s;tinct from their inherent value as a commodity." I do not very well com|prehend what this gentleman means by the extrin&s;ic value of gold and &s;ilver.

Their value re&s;ts chiefly on the e&s;tima|tion they <HI>happen</HI> to be in among the generality of na|tions, and the credit given to the opinion that e&s;tima|tion will continue; otherwi&s;e a pound of gold would not be a real equivalent for a bu&s;hel of wheat." The &s;econd is Ander&s;on on National Indu&s;try, who &s;ays, "Money, con&s;idered in it&s;elf, is of no value; but in many civilized nations, who have found how convenient it is for facilitating the barter or exchange of one com|modity for another, it has received an artificial value; &s;o that although u&s;ele&s;s in it&s;elf, it has come to be accepted among all civilized nations, as a token prov|ing that the per&s;on who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it had given &s;omething of real value in exchange for it, and is on that account accepted of by another in exchange for &s;omething that is of real utility and intrin&s;ic worth." The third is Sir James Stuart, who &s;ays, "By money, I under&s;tand any commodity which purely in it&s;elf is of no material u&s;e to man, but which acquires &s;uch an e&s;timation from his opinion of it, as to become the univer&s;al mea&s;ure of what is called value, and an adequate equivalent for any thing alienable." The name of any man how great &s;oever, will not have much weight with me, when I perceive that in any in&s;tance he has mi&s;taken his &s;ubject. This I believe has been the ca&s;e with all the gentlemen ju&s;t men|tioned. There is a con&s;iderable confu&s;ion in the ideas expre&s;&s;ed by the la&s;t two; but the thing in which
<PB N="14" REF="020154_0016_0FADF3F0553CA540">
they all agree, and for which they are adduced by this author, is, that they &s;eem to deny the intrin&s;ic value of gold and &s;ilver, and to impute the e&s;timati|on in which they are held, to accidental opinion. Now I mu&s;t beg leave to ob&s;erve, as to the compari&s;on of the intrin&s;ic worth of gold and iron, if it were po&s;&s;ible to determine whether, on &s;uppo&s;ition of iron and gold being in equal quantity, the one or the other would be the mo&s;t valuable, it would not be worth a &s;ingle &s;traw in the pre&s;ent que&s;tion; for if iron were the mo&s;t valuable, it would in that ca&s;e be the money, and the gold would be but in the next de|gree. Accidental opinion has nothing to do with it. It ari&s;es from the nature of things. As to a pound of gold not being, as to intrin&s;ic value, equivalent to a bu&s;hel of wheat, it might with equal truth be affirmed, that to a man peri&s;hing with hunger, a mountain of gold would not be equivalent to half a pound of bread. But is this any argument again&s;t the intrin&s;ic commercial value of gold, as it has taken place &s;ince the beginning of the world.</P>
<P>As to the other two authors, they &s;eem to &s;ay, that money is in it&s;elf of no value, and of no material u&s;e to man. If by <HI>money</HI> they mean gold and &s;ilver, the propo&s;ition is directly fal&s;e; becau&s;e they are both of material u&s;e for the purpo&s;es of &s;ocial life. But what has led them into this error has been their ab&s;tracting the idea, and taking money in the &s;ingle light of a &s;ign, without con&s;idering it as a &s;tandard. Then no doubt, even gold, while it continues in this
<PB N="15" REF="020154_0017_0FADF3F10F228EB8">
form, is of no other u&s;e than as a &s;ign of property. But how little is this to the purpo&s;e? for it is equally true of every other commodity. A nail, while it continues a nail, is of no other u&s;e but joining boards together, or &s;ome &s;imilar purpo&s;e, and can neither be lock nor key; but a quantity of nails, or the iron which they contain, can be ea&s;ily converted into ei|ther the one or the other. So a guinea, while it continues a guinea, is of no u&s;e whatever, but as an in&s;trument of commerce; but the gold of which a guinea con&s;i&s;ts, can ea&s;ily be converted into a ring, or any thing which its quantity will reach. This is what is called, with perfect propriety, its <HI>intrin&s;ic value.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THAT which is the medium of commerce mu&s;t be <HI>rare.</HI> It will not be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay much upon this, becau&s;e it has already received &s;ome illu&s;tration from what has gone before. It may however be ob|&s;erved, that the medium of commerce mu&s;t not only be &s;o rare, as to bring it within commercial value in ordinary ca&s;es, but it mu&s;t be much more rare than mo&s;t other things, that its value may be increa&s;ed, and a &s;mall quantity of it may repre&s;ent goods of con&s;iderable variety and bulk. If gold and &s;ilver were only twenty times as plentiful as they are at pre&s;ent, they would &s;till have a proper value, could be bought and &s;old, and applied to many u&s;eful purpo&s;es, but they would be quite unfit for general circulation.</P>

I think it is al&s;o plain, that there is nothing yet known to mankind, in which they are all &s;o fully united, as they are in gold and &s;ilver; which is the true rea&s;on why the&s;e metals have been applied as the in&s;truments of commerce, &s;ince the beginning of the world, or as far back as hi&s;tory enables us to pe|netrate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been &s;ugge&s;ted to me by a friend, that gold and &s;ilver po&s;&s;e&s;s another quality different from all the above, which, in an eminent degree, fits them for circulation as a me|dium, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that they are <HI>equable.</HI> The meaning of this ex|pre&s;&s;ion is, that the metal of each of the&s;e &s;pecies, when pure, is of the &s;ame finene&s;s and worth, and perfectly &s;imilar, from whatever different mines, or from whatever di&s;tant parts it may have been procured; which, it is &s;aid, is not the ca&s;e with any other metal.

<P>It will probably throw &s;ome light upon the above theory, if we take a brief view of the matter, as it has taken place in fact from the beginning of the world. This may be done now to the greater ad|vantage, that the effects of particular cau&s;es, and the events that will take place in &s;ociety in particular cir|cum&s;tances, have been &s;o fully a&s;certained by the ex|perience of ages, and the progre&s;s of &s;cience, that we

are able to make a better u&s;e of the few remains of ancient hi&s;tory, than could have been done by tho&s;e who lived nearer to the events which are recorded. It appears then, that the di&s;covery and u&s;e of metals was one of the earlie&s;t attainments of mankind. This might naturally be expected if they were within reach at all, becau&s;e of their very great utility in all works of indu&s;try, and indeed for all the purpo&s;es of con|venience and luxury. Therefore, I &s;uppo&s;e this fact will not be doubted; but it is a truth neither &s;o ob|vious nor &s;o much known, that gold, &s;ilver, and bra&s;s, or rather copper, were the mo&s;t ancient me|tals, and all of them antecedent to iron<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See upon this &s;ubject Pre&s;ident Goquet's Ri&s;e and Pro|gre&s;s of Laws, Arts and Sciences.

We learn from Homer, that in the wars of Troy, the weapons of war, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, were of copper; and &s;ome hi&s;torians tell us that they had a method of temper|ing or hardening it &s;o as to make it tolerably fit for the pur|po&s;e, though certainly not equal to iron or &s;teel.</NOTE>. The&s;e metals being applied to all the purpo&s;es of life, came of cour&s;e to con&s;titute a great part of the wealth of the people of ancient times. I have mentioned bra&s;s, becau&s;e it was one of the metals earlie&s;t known, and upon the very principles above laid down, was in the beginning made u&s;e of for money by many ancient nations.

That it was made u&s;e of for money among&s;t the Hebrews appears from many circum&s;tances. We read of gold, &s;ilver and bra&s;s brought as contributions to the taber|nacle &s;ervice in the time of Mo&s;es, and to the build|ing of the temple in David's. That bra&s;s was made u&s;e of as money in the early times of the Greeks and Romans, appears both from the a&s;&s;ertions of hi&s;|torians, and from the very languages of both nations, for there it is made u&s;e of to &s;ignify money in gene|ral<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the Roman language, <HI>oes</HI> &s;ignifies not only bra&s;s, but money in general, and from it many other words are derived; as, <HI>oerarium,</HI> the trea&s;ury; <HI>oes alienum,</HI> debt; <HI>oere mutare,</HI> to buy or &s;ell for money, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> So in the Greek tongue, <HI>chalkos</HI> &s;ignifies bra&s;s, <HI>achalkos,</HI> and <HI>achalkein,</HI> to be without money, or poor.

WE are al&s;o fully &s;upported by hi&s;tory in affirming, that all the&s;e metals were at fir&s;t e&s;timated and pa&s;&s;ed in commerce by weight.

The Greek money was of different weights from the lower &s;orts to the ta|lent, which was the large&s;t.

From this we &s;eem to have derived the Engli&s;h word pound. Very &s;oon however they came to have either coins, or at lea&s;t &s;mall pieces reckoned by number. Abimelech gave to Abraham, as Sarah's brother, one thou&s;and ke&s;eph; and Jo&s;eph was &s;old for twen|ty ke&s;eph, and he gave to his brother Benjamin three hundred ke&s;eph.

IT may be proper to ob&s;erve here, that &s;everal an|tiquaries have mentioned that &s;ome barbarous nations made u&s;e of ba&s;er metals, &s;uch as lead, tin, iron, and even leather, &s;hells, and bark of trees for money. This is no way contrary to the above theory, for &s;ome nations might indeed u&s;e lead, iron and tin as things of value, upon the &s;ame principles as others u&s;ed gold, &s;ilver and bra&s;s. I think it is &s;aid, and indeed is more than probable, that the nails given by our voyagers to the inhabitants of the South-&s;ea i&s;lands, pa&s;&s;ed from hand to hand as in&s;truments of commerce. As to leather, &s;hells, &amp;c. I &s;u&s;pect &s;ome part of this is fabulous; but if it did take place in any mea&s;ure, it has been a rude e&s;&s;ay, u&s;ing the &s;ign &s;eparately from the &s;tandard, and could not be of any great extent or long duration. We know indeed of one nation, after &s;ociety had been far ad|vanced, that made u&s;e of iron, even when very plen|tiful, for money, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the Lacedemonians. But this was not at all from rudene&s;s or ignorance; it was one of Lycurgus's extraordinary in&s;titutions, who intended by it (and did not conceal his intention) to bani&s;h riches, or real and proper money from the &s;tate. He indeed bani&s;hed indu&s;try at the &s;ame time, for none of his citizens were allowed even to be hu&s;bandmen, or to cultivate their lands. This was

left to the &s;laves. I do not find, therefore, that there is any thing in hi&s;tory de&s;erving credit, that militates again&s;t the theory above laid down.</P>
<P>HAVING thus laid down the theory of money, and &s;upported it by hi&s;tory and experience, I proceed to draw a few inferences from it, and apply them to &s;ome opinions which have taken place, and &s;ome mea&s;ures which have been adopted or propo&s;ed with re&s;pect to currency and commerce in this country. In the fir&s;t place, the above theory will enable every intelligent per&s;on to fix in his mind preci&s;ely what is or ought to be the meaning of a <HI>circulating medium.</HI> This phra&s;e is in every body's mouth, and we meet with it continually in the e&s;&s;ays publi&s;hed in the news|papers, and the &s;peeches of &s;enators in public a&s;&s;em|blies. We may &s;ay of this as controver&s;ial divines u&s;ed to &s;ay long ago, that a mi&s;con&s;ception of this is the <HI>protone p&s;eudos,</HI> the radical error. Not long &s;ince a writer in one of the papers &s;aid it was agreed on all hands that there is at pre&s;ent a &s;carcity of a circulating medium. To this I an&s;wer, that it is not agreed upon on any hand, but among tho&s;e who are wholly ignorant of the meaning of the expre&s;&s;ion. The circulating medium is not yours nor mine; it is not the riches of Holland, nor the poverty of Swe|den. It is that indefinite quantity of the precious metals that is made u&s;e of among the nations con|nected in commerce. Whether any particular per|&s;on, city, or nation, is rich or poor, has moreover le&s;s comparatively of it, is nothing to the purpo&s;e. Eve|ry

one will receive of the circulating medium that quantity which he is entitled to by his property or indu&s;try. It has been &s;hown that rarity is one of the qualities of a circulating medium. If it were more rare than it is, a le&s;s quantity would be &s;ufficient to repre&s;ent a &s;tated mea&s;ure of property. If it were more plentiful than it is, a greater quantity would be nece&s;&s;ary; but the comparative riches or poverty of nations or per&s;ons would be altogether the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Is any body ignorant that half a century ago in this country, a man might have bought a bu&s;hel of wheat for one quarter of a dollar, for which now he mu&s;t pay a whole dollar. Was not the quarter dol|lar then as good a circulating medium as the whole dollar is now? And was not the man ju&s;t as rich who had it in his pocket? Undoubtedly. Nay, I mu&s;t further &s;ay, it was a better circulating medium, be|cau&s;e it was of le&s;s &s;ize and weight. Has not the quantity of the precious metals increa&s;ed greatly &s;ince the di&s;covery of the mines of South-America? Is not the quantity now nece&s;&s;ary for any con&s;idera|ble purcha&s;e &s;o great as to be burden&s;ome in the tran&s;|portation?

How ea&s;y were it to point out places and countries in which there is a greater quantity of the circulating medium than any where el&s;e, and yet at the &s;ame time greater national and per&s;onal poverty, and probably for this very rea&s;on. What would it &s;ignify to a la|bourer in the mines of Peru if he &s;hould get a half

<P N="2">2. FROM the principles above laid down it will appear, that money having as one of its e&s;&s;ential qualities, an intrin&s;ic, that is to &s;ay, a commercial value, it mu&s;t be not only a &s;ign and &s;tandard or a medium of commerce, but al&s;o it&s;elf a commodity, or a &s;ubject of commerce. There are many tran&s;ac|tions
<PB N="25" REF="020154_0027_0FADF3FB946782C0">
re&s;pecting money in a trading nation, in which it is con&s;idered &s;ingly in this view. The&s;e it is un|nece&s;&s;ary for me to enumerate, but even where it is applied directly or principally as a medium of aliena|tion, its value as a &s;tandard doth and mu&s;t always follow and accommodate it&s;elf to its value as a com|modity. Hence it follows nece&s;&s;arily that money mu&s;t be &s;ubject to every rule that other commodities are &s;ubject to in buying and &s;elling. One of the chief of the&s;e is, that it mu&s;t ri&s;e and fall in price according to the quantity that is brought to market, compared with the demand there is for it. This is an unavoidable con&s;equence, and as nece&s;&s;ary in the ca&s;e of money as in that of any commodity whatever. If a greater quantity of money than before is brought into any country, even though brought by the fair|e&s;t and mo&s;t honourable means, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> increa&s;ing in|du&s;try and profitable trade, it will have the effect of rai&s;ing the price of other commodities in general, and of indu&s;try, which is the &s;ource of all commodi|ties. But we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that men are apt to view this in a wrong light. One commodity may ri&s;e or fall by its own plenty or &s;carcene&s;s; but when there is a great and general ri&s;e of prices, of all commo|dities, it would be at lea&s;t as proper, or rather much more &s;o, to &s;ay that money had fallen than that goods had ri&s;en.</P>
<P>WE had &s;o large experience of this during the war, by the exce&s;&s;ive emi&s;&s;ions of paper money, that it needs hardly any illu&s;tration. It is true, &s;ome per|&s;ons
<PB N="26" REF="020154_0028_0FADF3FC56F54DD8">
did then and do now &s;uppo&s;e, that the depreci|ation of the money was owing as much to the di&s;af|fection of &s;ome inhabitants, and the counterfeiting, and other artful endeavours of our enemies to de&s;troy it, as to the increa&s;ed quantity. But in this they were quite mi&s;taken. Jealou&s;y or &s;u&s;picion of the money would have had very different effects from a gradual continual ri&s;e of prices. If I meet with a &s;u&s;picious piece of money I do not rai&s;e the price of my goods, but refu&s;e to &s;ell them. This was indeed the ca&s;e with all tho&s;e who doubted the money of Congre&s;s in time of the war. Be&s;ides it is plain, that the American cau&s;e was mo&s;t doubtful, and its enemies mo&s;t numerous in the years 1776 and 1777, and yet the currency of the money was then very general, and its depreciation &s;low; whereas in the three following years, when, in con&s;equence of the French treaty and other European alliances, the con|fidence of the public in the cau&s;e was increa&s;ed, the depreciation was accelerated in an amazing degree. I mu&s;t al&s;o here make a remark upon another opinion often expre&s;&s;ed during the war, that the depreciation mu&s;t have been owing to other cau&s;es than the quan|tity, becau&s;e it was greater than what they called the natural depreciation, in con&s;equence of the quantity. By this they meant, that it was not regular; but when the quantity had ari&s;en, &s;uppo&s;e to five for one, the depreciation was as fifteen or twenty for one. The&s;e per&s;ons did not under&s;tand the depreciation of a commodity <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;equence of its quantity, for it
<PB N="27" REF="020154_0029_0FADF3FD19A38D88">
is not regular and equable, as in arithmetical pro|gre&s;&s;ion, but rapid and increa&s;ing, &s;o as &s;oon to get beyond all computation. If there is in any country but one tenth part more of any commodity than there is any demand for, the price will probably fall more than one half, and if there is double or treble the quantity needed, it will be what merchants call a drug, that cannot be &s;old at all, but if it be a pe|ri&s;hable commodity, mu&s;t &s;ink in the hand of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid above that the increa&s;e of money, even though in con&s;equence of national pro&s;perity, that is to &s;ay, internal indu&s;try and profitable trade, will yet nece&s;&s;arily have the effect of rai&s;ing the price of indu&s;try, and its fruits. This, however, mu&s;t evidently be in a far higher degree, and attended with much more pernicious effects, when it is thrown into circulation without indu&s;try; as when &s;ilver is found in capacious mines, or paper is i&s;&s;ued by the authority of a &s;tate, without mea&s;ure and without end. I verily believe that if as many millions of &s;i|lver dollars had fallen from heaven and been thrown into circulation as there were paper ones i&s;&s;ued by the United States, the di&s;order would have been as great or greater than it was. At lea&s;t it would have been &s;o at fir&s;t, the difference would have been, that &s;ilver being current over all, it would have &s;oon gone abroad and found its level, &s;o that the alteration would have been ultimately not in the United States, but in the general circulating medium over the whole

earth. Tho&s;e however among whom it was fir&s;t found, and who received it without indu&s;try, would have &s;uffered mo&s;t by it. Among them it would have produced lazine&s;s and luxury. Other nations would have drained it from them only by &s;uperior indu&s;try. The &s;tate of the Spani&s;h monarchy at pre&s;ent ought to be, and indeed in a great mea&s;ure has been, a le&s;&s;on to the whole world. At the time when they got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of South-America they were the mo&s;t powerful and wealthy &s;tate in Europe. Would any man at that time have been reckoned found in his judgment who &s;hould have affirmed that they would grow poor by means of the gold and &s;il|ver mines? Yet it has happened &s;o, and now there is hardly any politician &s;o &s;hallow but he can a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;on of it. They thought that gold and &s;ilver would at once procure them every thing without working; but forgot that the more they had of it they mu&s;t pay &s;o much the more to tho&s;e who were willing to work for them.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE above principles will clearly &s;hew, that what is commonly called paper money, that is, bills bearing that the per&s;on holding them is entitled to receive a certain &s;um &s;pecified in them, is not pro|perty &s;peaking money at all. It is barely a &s;ign with|out being a pledge or &s;tandard of value, and there|fore is e&s;&s;entially defective as a medium of univer&s;al commerce. I will afterwards &s;peak of the different kinds of it, and point out their real and proper u&s;es; but in the mean time I ob&s;erve, that to arm &s;uch
<PB N="29" REF="020154_0031_0FADF3FF68781B80">
bills with the authority of the &s;tate, and make them a legal tender in all payments, is an ab&s;urdity &s;o great that is not ea&s;y to &s;peak with propriety upon it. Per|haps it would give offence if I &s;hould &s;ay, it is an ab&s;ur|dity re&s;erved for American legi&s;latures; no &s;uch thing having ever been attempted in the old countries. It has been found, by the experience of ages, that money mu&s;t have a &s;tandard of value, and if any prince or &s;tate deba&s;e the metal below the &s;tandard, it is utter|ly impo&s;&s;ible to make it &s;ucceed. How then can it be po&s;&s;ible to make that &s;ucceed which has no value at all? In all &s;uch in&s;tances there may be great inju|ries done to particular per&s;ons by wiping off debts; but to give &s;uch money general currency is wholly impo&s;&s;ible. The mea&s;ure carries ab&s;urdity in its very face. Why will you make a law to oblige men to take money when it is offered them? Are there any who refu&s;e it when it is good? If it is nece&s;&s;ary to force them, does not this demon&s;trate that it is not good? We have &s;een indeed this &s;y&s;tem produce a mo&s;t ludicrous inver&s;ion of the nature of things. For two or three years we con&s;tantly &s;aw and were in|formed of creditors running away from their debtors, and the debtors pur&s;uing them in triumph, and pay|ing them without mercy.</P>
<P>LET us examine this matter a little more fully. Money is the medium of commercial tran&s;actions. Money is it&s;elf a commodity. Therefore every tran&s;|action in which money is concerned, by being giv|en or promi&s;ed, is &s;trictly and properly &s;peaking a
<PB N="30" REF="020154_0032_0FADF4001656E328">
bargain, or as it is well called in common language, an agreement. To give, therefore, authority or no|minal value by law to any money, is interpo&s;ing by law in commerce, and is preci&s;ely the &s;ame thing with laws regulating the prices of commodities, of which, in their full extent, we had &s;ufficient expe|rience during the war. Now nothing can be more radically unju&s;t, or more eminently ab&s;urd, than laws of that nature. Among all civilians, the tran&s;|actions of commerce are ranged under the head of contracts. Without entering into the nicer di&s;tinc|tions of writers upon this &s;ubject, it is &s;ufficient for me to &s;ay, that commerce, or buying and &s;elling, is founded upon that &s;pecies of contracts that is mo&s;t formal and complete. They are called in the tech|nical language, <HI>Onerous contracts,</HI> where the proper and ju&s;t value is &s;uppo&s;ed to be given or promi&s;ed on both &s;ides. That is to &s;ay, the per&s;on who offers any thing to &s;ale, does it becau&s;e he has it to &s;pare, and he thinks it would be better for him to have the money, or &s;ome other commodity, than what he parts with; and he who buys, in like manner, thinks it would be better for him to receive the commodity, than to retain the money. There may be mi&s;takes or fraud in many tran&s;actions; but the&s;e do not af|fect the argument in the lea&s;t. A fair and ju&s;t value is always &s;uppo&s;ed or profe&s;&s;ed to be given on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>WELL! is it agreed that all commerce is founded on a complete contract? Let then any per&s;on who will,
<PB N="31" REF="020154_0033_0FADF400D377B038">
open as many books as he plea&s;es written upon the &s;ubject, and tell me whether he does not always find there that one of the e&s;&s;ential conditions of a lawful contract, and indeed the fir&s;t of them, is, that it be <HI>free</HI> and <HI>mutual.</HI> Without this it may be &s;ome|thing el&s;e, and have &s;ome other binding force, but it is not a contract. To make laws therefore, regu|lating the prices of commodities, or giving nominal value to that which had no value before the law was made, is altering the nature of the tran&s;action alto|gether. Perhaps a compari&s;on of this with other tran&s;actions of a different kind might &s;et this matter in a clear light. Suppo&s;e a man were to &s;ay to one of our lawgivers upon this &s;ubject as follows: When you make a law laying on a tax, and telling me I mu&s;t pay &s;o much to the public and common expen|ces of the &s;tate, I under&s;tand this very well. It fall, under the head of <HI>authority.</HI> You may lay on an improper or injudicious tax that will operate unequal|ly, or not be productive of what you expect; but &s;till this is within your line, and if I have any com|plaint, I can only wi&s;h that at the next election we may get wi&s;er men. Again, a Ju&s;tice of Peace in time of war may give a pre&s;s-warrant, and take my hor&s;es and waggons to tran&s;port provi&s;ions or bag|gage for an army. I under&s;tand this al&s;o; writers and rea&s;oners tell me that it falls under the head of what they call the <HI>rights of nece&s;&s;ity.</HI> The meaning of this is, that no civil con&s;titution can be &s;o perfect but that &s;ome ca&s;es will occur, in which the property
<PB N="32" REF="020154_0034_0FADF4018FBEFD98">
of individuals mu&s;t give way to the urgent call of common utility or general danger. Thus we know, that in cities, in ca&s;e of a fire, &s;ometimes a hou&s;e, without the con&s;ent of its owner, will be de&s;troyed to prevent the whole from being con&s;umed. But if you make a law that I &s;hall be obliged to <HI>&s;ell</HI> my grain, my cattle, or any commodity, at a certain price, you not only do what is unju&s;t and impolitic, but with all re&s;pect be it &s;aid, you &s;peak non&s;en&s;e; for I do not <HI>&s;ell</HI> them at all; you take them from me. You are both buyer and &s;eller, and I am the &s;ufferer only.</P>
<P>I CANNOT help ob&s;erving, that laws of this kind have an inherent weakne&s;s in them; they are not on|ly unju&s;t and unwi&s;e, but for the mo&s;t part impracti|cable. They are an attempt to apply authority to that which is not its proper object, and to extend it beyond its natural bounds; in both which we &s;hall be &s;ure to fail. The production of commodities mu&s;t be the effect of indu&s;try, inclination, hope, and in|tere&s;t. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is very imperfectly reached by authority, and the other three cannot be reached by it at all. Perhaps I ought rather to have &s;aid, that they cannot be directed by it, but they may be greatly counteracted; as people have naturally a &s;trong di&s;po&s;ition to re&s;i&s;t force, and to e&s;cape from con&s;traint. Accordingly we found in this country, and every other &s;ociety who ever tried &s;uch mea&s;ures found, that they produced an effect directly contrary to what was expected from them. In&s;tead of pro|ducing
<PB N="33" REF="020154_0035_0FADF4038F46B4A0">
moderation and plenty, they uniformly pro|duced dearne&s;s and &s;carcity. It is worth while to ob&s;erve, that &s;ome of our legi&s;latures &s;aw &s;o far into the&s;e matters as to perceive that they could not re|gulate the price of commodities without regulating the price of the indu&s;try that produced them. There|fore they regulated the price of day-labourers. This however, though but one &s;pecies of indu&s;try, was found to be wholly out of their power.</P>
<P>THERE were &s;ome in&s;tances mentioned at the time when the&s;e mea&s;ures were in vogue, which &s;uperficial rea&s;oners &s;uppo&s;ed to be examples of regulating laws attended with good effects. The&s;e were the regulation of the prices of chairs, hackney coaches, and ticket por|ters in cities, public ferries, and &s;ome others. But this was quite mi&s;taking the nature of the thing. The&s;e in&s;tances have not the lea&s;t connexion with laws regulating prices in voluntary commerce. In all the&s;e ca&s;es the per&s;ons who are employed &s;olicit the privilege, obtain a licence, and come under volunta|ry engagements to a&s;k no higher prices; &s;o that there is as complete a free contract as in buying and &s;elling in open &s;hops. I am &s;o fully convinced of the truth and ju&s;tice of the above principles, that I think, were it proper at this time, I could &s;hew, that even in the mo&s;t enlightened nations of Europe there are &s;till &s;ome laws &s;ub&s;i&s;ting which work in direct oppo|&s;ition to the intention of their makers. Of this kind in general are the laws again&s;t fore&s;talling and regrat|ing. They are now indeed mo&s;t of them a&s;leep, and
<PB N="34" REF="020154_0036_0FADF40403D3EB60">
what the lawyers call in de&s;uetude; but &s;o far as they are executed, they have the mo&s;t powerful tendency to prevent, in&s;tead of promoting, full and rea&s;ona|ble markets. As an example of our own &s;kill in that branch, a law was pa&s;t in Penn&s;ylvania in time of the war preci&s;ely upon that principle. It ordained that in all imported articles there &s;hould be but one &s;tep between the importer and con&s;umer, and there|fore that none but tho&s;e who bought from the &s;hip &s;hould be allowed to &s;ell again. I cite this in&s;tance by memory, but am certain that &s;uch was the &s;pirit of the law. The makers of it con&s;idered that every hand through which a commodity pa&s;&s;ed mu&s;t have a profit upon it, which would therefore greatly aug|ment the co&s;t to the con&s;umer at la&s;t. But could any thing in the world be more ab&s;urd? How could a family at one hundred miles di&s;tance from the &s;ea|port be &s;upplied with what they wanted? In oppo|&s;ition to this principle it may be &s;afely affirmed, that the more merchants the cheaper goods, and that no carriage is &s;o cheap, nor any di&s;tribution &s;o equal or &s;o plentiful as that which is made by tho&s;e who have an intere&s;t in it, and expect a profit from it.</P>
<P>I HAVE gone into this detail in order to &s;how that tender laws, arming paper, or any thing not valuable in it&s;elf with authority, are directly contrary to the very fir&s;t principles of commerce. This was certain|ly the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e many of the advocates for &s;uch laws, and many of tho&s;e who are in&s;tru|mental in enacting them, do it from pure ignorance,
<PB N="35" REF="020154_0037_0FADF40603A2FFF0">
without any bad intention. It may probably have &s;ome effect in opening their eyes to ob&s;erve, that no paper whatever is a tender in any nation in Europe. Even the notes of the bank of England, which are as good as gold, and tho&s;e of the bank of Holland, which are con&s;iderably better<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps it may be proper to inform &s;ome readers what this expre&s;&s;ion refers to. It refers to the agio of the bank of Hol|land. A bill of that bank generally goes for a little more in payment with any dealer than the &s;um it &s;pecifies, and this advance or difference is called the Agio of the Bank, and ri&s;es or falls like the rate of exchange. This probably ari&s;es from its perfect &s;ecurity, and the very great advantage in point of ea&s;e and expedition, in transferirng, reckoning, and conceal|ing of paper above gold and &s;ilver.

We may perhaps even &s;ay more, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that the coin|age of gold and &s;ilver in any country is not &s;o much, if at all, to oblige per&s;ons to receive it at a certain
<PB N="36" REF="020154_0038_0FADF4060E5CD588">
value, as to a&s;certain them that it is of the value &s;tampt upon it. Without this ignorant per&s;ons would be continually at a lo&s;s to know the finene&s;s and the weight of pieces offered to them. This will appear from the two following remarks. (1.) If by any accident in the coinage, or fraud in the officers of the mint, &s;ome of the pieces had not the full quantity, or were not of &s;ufficient finene&s;s, though the &s;tamp were ever &s;o genuine, if I could di&s;cover the defect, I &s;hould be ju&s;tified in refu&s;ing it. (2.) There is &s;ometimes a fluctuation in the comparative value of gold and &s;ilver, and in the&s;e ca&s;es, though no doubt a debtor, till the error that has crept in be rectified by authority, has a right to pay in any lawful money; yet if I were &s;elling goods, and gold had fallen in its value, I might &s;afely &s;ay to the cu&s;|tomer, in what coin are you to pay me? I will give you a yard of this &s;ilk for twenty-one &s;terling &s;ilver &s;hillings, but if you give me a guinea I mu&s;t have another &s;hilling before I will part with it. The whole of this &s;erves to &s;how that nothing &s;hore of real money, which is of &s;tandard value, ought <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> be enforced by law in a well regulated &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE principles above laid down will enable us to perceive clearly what is the nature of paper circu|lating as a medium of commerce, what is its real and proper u&s;e, and what are its dangers and defects. As to its nature, it is a &s;ign but not a &s;tandard. It is properly an obligation, or to u&s;e a modern com|mercial phra&s;e, it is a promi&s;&s;ory note. It is not
<PB N="37" REF="020154_0039_0FADF406CE0DFA08">
money, as has been &s;hewn above, but it is a promi&s;e of &s;ome per&s;on or body of men to pay money either on demand or at a particular time, or &s;ome general undefined future time. Obligations of this nature are of more &s;orts than one. Sometimes they are given by particular per&s;ons, or trading companies, who are con&s;idered as per&s;ons; and frequently in A|merica they have been given by the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate. In the general definition I have included all kinds of negotiable paper, but it will not be nece&s;|&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t upon more than two of them, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the notes of banking companies, and &s;tate <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. Bills of exchange are not &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s through many hands, but to proceed as &s;peedily as may be to the place of their payment. Government &s;ecurities are only bought and &s;old like other property, and &s;o any <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> other private obligations may be transferred a often as people are willing to receive them; but the notes of banking companies, and the &s;tate emi&s;|&s;ions of this country are intended to be, properly &s;peaking, a circulating medium. They are of various regular denominations, and intended to an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of money in the &s;maller tran&s;actions of &s;ociety as well as the larger, and even to go to market for purcha&s;ing the nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>As to value, &s;uch obligations mu&s;t plainly depend upon the credit of the &s;ub&s;criber or obligor, and the opinion or expectation of the receiver. The&s;e are mutually nece&s;&s;ary to their u&s;e in commerce. Let the re&s;ources of wealth of the &s;ub&s;criber be what
<PB N="38" REF="020154_0040_0FADF4085172E758">
they may, it is the public opinion that mu&s;t ulti|mately give them currency. This opinion however may be in &s;ome in&s;tances better, and in &s;ome wor&s;e founded. That paper which may with mo&s;t certainty and expedition be converted into gold and &s;ilver, &s;eems evidently to have the advantage on this account. Therefore the notes of banking companies, while they maintain their credit, and continue to pay on demand, appear to be the be&s;t calculated for general u&s;e. They &s;eem al&s;o to have another advantage, that private per&s;ons and companies are upon a footing with the holder of the bills. He can arre&s;t them, and bring them to account, and have ju&s;tice done upon them; whereas he cannot call the legi&s;lature to account, but mu&s;t wholly depend upon their fide|lity as well as re&s;ources. Yet it mu&s;t be owned there have not been wanting in&s;tances formerly in this country, in which paper emi&s;&s;ions by the &s;tates have obtained full confidence, and met with no impedi|ment in circulation.</P>
<P>LET us now con&s;ider what is the proper u&s;e of paper currency, or whether it be of any real u&s;e at all. Many per&s;ons in Europe have declared again&s;t it altogether as pernicious. I will endeavour to &s;tate this matter with all the clearne&s;s I am capable of, and to give the rea&s;ons for what I &s;hall advance. We have &s;een above that nothing can be more ab&s;urd than to &s;ay that we now want a circulating medium, and that paper is nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e. A cir|culating medium we have already, not in too &s;mall,
<PB N="39" REF="020154_0041_0FADF4099F88EBF8">
but in too great quantity; &s;o that any per&s;on who under&s;tands the &s;ubject may perceive that gold and &s;ilver, e&s;pecially the la&s;t, is lo&s;ing at lea&s;t one of the qualities nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e, and becoming too bulky and heavy for ea&s;y and convenient tran&s;|portation. Bra&s;s, as has been &s;hown above, was once as ju&s;t and proper a medium of commerce as gold and &s;ilver are now. It has all the qualities nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e &s;till, except rarity; &s;o that if it were not too plentiful and too cheap, it would be money to this day. It is probable that this cir|cum&s;tance of the abundance and weight of the pre|cious metals is what gives to many &s;uch an inclina|tion for paper money. This will appear &s;trange to &s;ome, yet I believe it is at bottom ju&s;t. The cry with many is, we mu&s;t have paper for a circulating medium, as there is &s;uch a &s;carcity of gold and &s;ilver. Is this ju&s;t? No. They mi&s;take their own poverty or the nation's poverty, for a &s;carcity of gold and &s;ilver, whereas in fact, gold and &s;ilver u&s;ed as a cir|culating medium are &s;o cheap, and the quantity of a moderate &s;um is &s;uch an incumbrance that we want paper, which can be much more ea&s;ily carried, and much more effectually concealed. So that, contrary to the vulgur idea, we are obliged to have recour&s;e to paper in &s;everal ca&s;es, not for want of gold and &s;ilver, but their too great abundance.</P>
<P>THIS will appear to be a very uncouth idea to many per&s;ons. What, they will &s;ay, too great a|bundance of gold and &s;ilver! when I go about from
<PB N="40" REF="020154_0042_0FADF40A699B2B38">
day to day, and cannot collect what is due to me; when my creditors are calling upon me and I cannot &s;atis|fy them. There is a &s;carcity of money every where. What &s;hall be &s;aid to &s;atisfy the&s;e per&s;ons? I mu&s;t tell them plainly, It is their poverty, or the nation's poverty, and not a want of gold and &s;ilver, and if there were an hundred times as much gold and &s;ilver in circulation as there is, their poverty and difficulties would be ju&s;t the &s;ame. If the&s;e per&s;ons read the &s;criptures, they may there learn, that in Solomon's time the &s;ilver was as plentiful <HI>as &s;tones in Jeru&s;alem;</HI> probably they will think that all the people in Jeru|&s;alem at that time mu&s;t have lived like Princes, but they mu&s;t be told, that it was added as a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, that <HI>it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</HI></P>
<P>IF paper then is not needed as a circulating medi|um, what benefit ari&s;es from it? I an&s;wer, the u&s;es of paper &s;ub&s;tituted for money may be &s;ummed up under the two following heads. (1.) It is u&s;eful for facilitating commerce. (2.) It is u&s;eful for antici|pating property or extending credit. Fir&s;t, it is u&s;eful for facilitating commerce. Nothing can be more advantageous for that purpo&s;e than bills of ex|change, which, without the actual tran&s;portation of money or goods, can transfer property even to the mo&s;t di&s;tant places with the mo&s;t perfect facility. There have been many per&s;ons who have doubted whether any other &s;ort of paper currency is not upon the whole hurtful, but the benefit of this is beyond
<PB N="41" REF="020154_0043_0FADF40A9219D9A0">
all que&s;tion. We &s;hall afterwards compare the ad|vantages and di&s;advantages of paper money; but at pre&s;ent let us leave out the con&s;ideration of the evil that it does, and it is manife&s;t that there is &s;o great a facility and &s;afety in the tran&s;portation of paper above that of gold and &s;ilver, that it mu&s;t greatly expedite all mercantile tran&s;actions, internal and external. Suppo&s;e one hundred thou&s;and pounds were to be tran&s;ported but three hundred miles, if it were to be carried in &s;ilver, what an immen&s;e load would it be? But be&s;ides the weight, as it could not be concealed, there would be a very great ri&s;k of inviting robbers to &s;hare in it. Let it be carefully ob&s;erved, that this good effect of paper is not from the additional quantity thrown into circulation, but from its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ome advantages &s;uperior to gold and &s;ilver, provided that the credit of it is &s;upported. Nor mu&s;t it be forgotten, that it is in great and ex|ten&s;ive negotiations only, that this advantage is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by paper; for in &s;maller bargains and that in|tercour&s;e between man and man that is carried on every hour, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no advantage at all; on the contrary, it is liable to wear and wa&s;te, and there|fore the &s;maller coins are in all re&s;pects to be pre|ferred.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER u&s;e of paper in commerce is to ex|tend credit. Though in very large tran&s;actions the ad|vantage of paper may be great, as it facilitates com|merce; yet when we con&s;ider paper as generally cir|culating,
<PB N="42" REF="020154_0044_0FADF40B509E0740">
and doing the office of gold and &s;ilver, it is by the exten&s;ion of credit only, or chiefly, that it can be of any advantage. It is unnece&s;&s;ary for me, and perhaps not in my power, to mention all the ways in which credit may be increa&s;ed or facilitated by pa|per. Some will probably be mentioned afterwards; at pre&s;ent my bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;hew, that giving credit is one of the advantages, and indeed in my opinion it is the principal advantage, to be derived from paper circulation of any kind. There are many people who&s;e indu&s;try is damped or limited by want of &s;tock or credit, who if they were properly a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the&s;e re&s;pects, might do &s;ignal &s;ervice to them&s;elves, and the community of which they are members. It has been generally &s;aid, and I believe with truth, that the in&s;titution of the banks in Scotland has improved the country in the cour&s;e of little more than half a century to a degree that is hardly credible. It is al&s;o probable, that the manufactures and commerce of England have been greatly promoted by the ea&s;y and regular methods of obtaining credit from the public and private banks. I am &s;en&s;ible that &s;ome very in|telligent per&s;ons in Britain have condemned the pa|per circulation even there, and affirmed that it does more harm than good. It is not nece&s;&s;ary for me to enter into the arguments on either &s;ide of that que&s;tion. All that I am concerned to prove is&punc; that if it does good upon the whole, or whatever good it does in any degree, ari&s;es from the credit which it

<P>LET us next con&s;ider the evil that is done by paper. This is what I would particularly reque&s;t the reader to attend to, as it was what this di&s;cour&s;e was chiefly intended to evince, and what the public &s;eems but little aware of. The evil is this: All paper intro|duced into circulation, and obtaining credit as gold and &s;ilver, adds to the quantity of the medium, and thereby, as has been &s;hown above, increa&s;es the price of indu&s;try and its fruits<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This will perhaps be mi&s;apprehended by &s;ome readers. They will &s;ay, a high price for our indu&s;try! This is ju&s;t what we want, and what all de&s;ire. But the price I mean here is not the price which you get for your indu&s;try, but that which you pay for it. A high price, by a great demand from foreign nations, is your profit; but the co&s;t which you pay for &s;ervant tools, rent of land, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> le&s;&s;ens that profit, and it is this which is increa&s;ed by increa&s;ing the circulating medium, and not the other. Make as much money as you plea&s;e, this will not make foreign nations call for any more of your grain, fi&s;h, lumber, tobacco, rice, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> but it will ju&s;t as certainly make them co&s;t you more before you can bring them to the market, as add|ing two to three will make five.</NOTE>. This con&s;equence is unavoidable, and follows as certainly from good pa|per as bad, or rather more certainly, for the medium is increa&s;ed only by that which obtains credit. At
<PB N="44" REF="020154_0046_0FADF40CE4AF3470">
the &s;ame time this con&s;equence is local, becau&s;e the paper does not pa&s;s among other nations, and there|fore it works again&s;t the intere&s;t of the people who u&s;e it, and nece&s;&s;arily draws off their gold and &s;ilver, which mu&s;t be made u&s;e of in all foreign payments. Men may think what they plea&s;e, but there is no contending with the nature of things. Experience has every where ju&s;tified the remark, that wherever paper is introduced in large quantities, the gold and &s;ilver vani&s;hes univer&s;ally. The joint &s;um of gold, &s;ilver, and paper, current, will exactly repre&s;ent your whole commodities, and the prices will be according|ly. It is therefore as if you were to fill a ve&s;&s;el brim full, making half the quantity water and the other oyl, the la&s;t being &s;pecifically lighte&s;t will be at the top, and if you add more water, the oyl only will run over, and continue running till there is none left. How ab&s;urd and contemptible then is the rea&s;oning which we have of late &s;een frequently in print, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the gold and &s;ilver is going away from us, therefore we mu&s;t have paper to &s;upply its place. If the gold and &s;ilver is indeed going away from us, that is to &s;ay, if the balance of trade is much again&s;t us, the paper medium has a direct tendency to increa&s;e the evil, and &s;end it away by a quicker pace.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="020154_0047_0FADF40D8FC045B8">
I HAVE &s;aid, that this con&s;equence follows from all paper, as &s;uch, good and bad, &s;o far as it enters into circulation; but every one mu&s;t perceive that there is a peculiar, and indeed a different evil to be feared from paper of a doubtful kind, and e&s;pecially from that which being doubtful is obliged to be &s;up|ported by coercive laws. This mu&s;t rai&s;e general &s;u&s;picion, and con&s;equently bring on a &s;tagnation of commerce, from univer&s;al and mutual di&s;tru&s;t. For the &s;ame rea&s;on it mu&s;t annihilate credit, and make every cautious per&s;on lock up his real money, that is, gold and &s;ilver, as he cannot tell but he may be cheated in the repayment. This evil is very exten|&s;ive indeed, for it makes people &s;u&s;picious, not only of what is, but what may be. Though the injury &s;hould be but partial, or incon&s;iderable at pre&s;ent, it may become wholly ruinous by &s;ome unknown fu|ture law.</P>
<P>HENCE it may be &s;een, that the re&s;olution of the que&s;tion, whether it is proper to have paper money at all or not, depends entirely upon another, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> whether the evil that is done by augmenting the cir|culating medium, is or is not overbalanced by the fa|cility given to commerce, and the credit given to particular per&s;ons, by which their indu&s;try and ex|ertions are added to the common &s;tock. As it is upon this that the que&s;tion depends, we &s;hall find, that as the circum&s;tances of a nation may be different, it may be for or again&s;t its intere&s;t to u&s;e a paper medium. If any nation were in &s;uch circum&s;tances
<PB N="46" REF="020154_0048_0FADF40E98CC1560">
as that credit were either not nece&s;&s;ary or ea&s;ily ob|tained; if the country were fully &s;ettled, and the inhabitants fully employed in agriculture, manufac|tures, and internal commerce, with little foreign trade, any addition to the true money would be un|nece&s;&s;ary or pernicious. This is probably the &s;tate of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> pre&s;ent, perhaps in &s;ome degree al&s;o of France. On the contrary, if a nation had an exten|&s;ive and complicated commerce, and much land to &s;ettle and improve, the facilitating of commerce, and extending of credit, might be highly beneficial. I do not pretend to &s;o exact a knowledge of the &s;tate of this country, or the different parts of it, as to judge with ab&s;olute certainty of what is nece&s;&s;ary or would be u&s;eful to it, but am inclined to think that there mu&s;t be &s;omething in the &s;tate of things in America that makes it either more nece&s;&s;ary or more expedient to have paper here than in the European &s;tates. We are a&s;&s;ured that in former times many of the &s;tates, then colonies, thought it a privilege to be allowed to &s;trike paper money; and we are told by per&s;ons of good under&s;tanding, that it contributed to their growth and improvement. If this was the ca&s;e, I am confident it was chiefly becau&s;e it was emitted in the way of a loan-office, and by giving credit to hu&s;bandmen, accelerated the &s;ettlement and improve|ment of the &s;oil. This que&s;tion I do not take upon me to decide, and therefore in what follows, de&s;ire I may be con&s;idered as &s;peaking only hypothetically, the rather, that at pre&s;ent the inclination after paper

<P>If therefore paper is to be employed in circula|tion, we may &s;ee from what has been &s;aid above, what are the principles on which it ought to be con|ducted, the ends that ought to be aimed at, and the evils that ought to be avoided. The ends to be aimed at are, the facilitating of commercial tran&s;actions, and extending of credit to tho&s;e who are likely to make a proper u&s;e of it. The plan &s;hould be &s;o con|ceived, as that the increa&s;e of the circulating medium &s;hould be as little as po&s;&s;ible, con&s;i&s;tently with the&s;e ends. It &s;hould be perfectly &s;ecure, &s;o as to create an ab&s;olute confidence. And as it is of the nature of an obligation&punc; no force whatever &s;hould be u&s;ed, but the reception of it left entirely to the inclination and intere&s;t of the receiver. It may be &s;afely affirm|ed, that any deviation from the&s;e principles, which are deduced from the theory above laid down, will be an e&s;&s;ential defect in the &s;y&s;tem. If we enquire what &s;ort of paper will be&s;t an&s;wer this de&s;cription, we find that there is no other &s;ort u&s;ed in Europe than that of banking companies. The government &s;tamp|ing paper to pa&s;s current for coin is unknown there. Notwith&s;tanding the immen&s;e &s;ums which have been borrowed by the Engli&s;h government, they always prefer paying intere&s;t for them, to i&s;&s;uing paper with|out value for money. The only thing re&s;embling it in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory is, James the Second coining ba&s;e metal, and affixing a price to it by proclama|tion;
<PB N="48" REF="020154_0050_0FADF411CDBF8BE8">
a project contemptible in the contrivance, and abortive in the execution.

<P>THE paper of banking companies has many advan|tages. It is con&s;idered as perfectly &s;afe, becau&s;e it can be exchanged for gold and &s;ilver at any time upon demand. Having this &s;ecurity at bottom, it is per|fectly convenient for tran&s;portation, which indeed is common to it with all paper. In addition to this, it is con&s;idered as the the principal bu&s;ine&s;s of all banks to give credit, which, though directly only in favour of commercial, is ultimately u&s;eful to ma|ny different cla&s;&s;es of men. I may upon this ob&s;erve, that it is the duty of banking companies &s;o to con|duct their operations as to extend their regular credit as far as is fafe for them&s;elves. If in&s;tead of this, as has been &s;uppo&s;ed at lea&s;t to have been done by &s;ome banks in Britain, they circulate their notes by agents, making purcha&s;es in different and di&s;tant places, that the &s;um i&s;&s;ued may very far exceed the &s;um nece&s;&s;ary to be kept for probable demands; they are in that ca&s;e not &s;erving the public at all, but u&s;ing the mo|ney
<PB N="49" REF="020154_0051_0FADF4131BB206E0">
of other people to their own profit. It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that the denomination of their notes &s;hould never be very &s;mall, it &s;hould indeed be as high as is con&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch a general u&s;e as will bring in a &s;ufficient profit. Very &s;mall denominations of paper do the greate&s;t injury by entering into uni|ver&s;al circulation, and chiefly affecting the indu&s;trious part of the community. It was a very great com|plaint again&s;t &s;ome banks in Scotland, that they brought down the denominations of their notes as far as ten &s;hillings, and &s;ome of them even five &s;hillings. If this was an evil, what &s;hall we &s;ay of paper, as has been &s;een in this country, as low as one &s;hilling, &s;ix-pence, or even three-pence value. It is a rule that will hardly admit of any exception, that the higher the denominations of paper bills, the greater the benefit and the le&s;s the evil; and on the contrary, the &s;maller the denominations, the greater the evil and the le&s;s the benefit. High &s;ums in paper obli|gations may perhaps change hands once a week, but a &s;hilling or &s;ix-penny ticket may be in fifty hands in one day.</P>
<P>I MUST mention here what has been often objected again&s;t banks in America, which, if ju&s;t, would, from the rea&s;oning in the preceding part of this di&s;|cour&s;e, tend to their condemnation. It is, that they have de&s;troyed credit in&s;tead of extending it, and have introduced or given occa&s;ion to exce&s;&s;ive u&s;ury. I am not &s;ufficiently informed to &s;ay how far this is really the ca&s;e, but cannot help ob&s;erving, that treat|ing
<PB N="50" REF="020154_0052_0FADF414304BA1D8">
the matter theoretically, as I have all along done, and con&s;idering the nature of the thing, this does not appear to be a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence. One would rather think that the regular credit which is or ought to be given by banks &s;hould prevent u&s;ury, by &s;upplying all tho&s;e who de&s;erve to be tru&s;ted. Agreeably to this it was found in fact, that the in|&s;titution of banks in Scotland lowered the intere&s;t of money, which indeed &s;eems to be the natural effect of every &s;uch in&s;titution, from the increa&s;ed circula|tion. But if any in&s;tances more than before have happened of this kind, it may be by per&s;ons in ex|treme nece&s;&s;ity applying to others who have credit with the bank, and who have &s;o little con&s;ci|entious &s;cruple as to take advantage of their neigh|bour's poverty. If this is the ca&s;e, it is only a par|ticular abu&s;e, or occa&s;ional bad con&s;equence of a thing otherwi&s;e good and u&s;eful. It is not a ju&s;t objection again&s;t any thing, that it may be or has been in &s;ome in&s;tances abu&s;ed. Be&s;ides, as it is the duty of every banking company to guard again&s;t this evil as much as po&s;&s;ible, even by per&s;onal re&s;entment, again&s;t tho&s;e who make this u&s;e of their confidence, &s;o it is an evil not out of the reach of legal puni&s;h|ment or general infamy. Wi&s;e and well executed laws again&s;t u&s;ury, would at lea&s;t &s;o far re&s;train it, as to make it an evil of little con&s;equence.</P>
<P>BUT in examining the nature and operation of different kinds of paper, I mu&s;t con&s;ider an objection of much greater importance, upon the principles of
<PB N="51" REF="020154_0053_0FADF41454294910">
this di&s;cour&s;e, again&s;t the paper of banks, or at lea&s;t, a defect in their &s;y&s;tem, that &s;eems to call for other mea&s;ures in addition to it. This is, that banking companies give credit only &s;o as to be &s;erviceable to merchants, and tho&s;e immediately connected with them, but do not extend it to hu&s;bandmen, or tho&s;e who improve the &s;oil, by taking mortgages for a con&s;iderable time; yet according to the theory above laid down, this is not only one of the advantages, but perhaps the chief advantage to be derived from a paper circulation of any kind. Now, I admit, that the &s;ettlement and cultivation of the &s;oil is the radi|cal &s;ource of the pro&s;perity of this country. It is indeed the &s;ource of the pro&s;perity of every country, but comparatively more &s;o of that of this country than mo&s;t others. I al&s;o admit that credit, properly extended, to indu&s;trious per&s;ons in this way would be exceedingly beneficial. For this rea&s;on, and for this alone, Dr. Franklin and others perhaps judged right when they &s;aid, the country received great benefit from the loan-office paper of former times. I am al|&s;o &s;en&s;ible, that it is not practicable nor proper for banking companies to give credit upon mortgages on di&s;tant lands. They being bound to prompt pay|ment, mu&s;t expect the &s;ame; therefore they are not to be blamed for refu&s;ing it in this form<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that the banks of Scotland never gave credit upon mortgages, but per&s;onal &s;ecurity only, and yet they were univer&s;ally &s;uppo&s;ed to put it in the power of landed men to improve their e&s;tates; &s;o that the money tran&s;|actions mu&s;t have been, though not directly, yet remotely, in their favour.</NOTE>. For all

the&s;e rea&s;ons, I do not take upon me wholly to con|demn a mea&s;ure in America, which would be unne|ce&s;&s;ary or improper in Europe. We hear from every quarter, that is to &s;ay, from almo&s;t every &s;tate, a loud cry for paper money. Now, when there is a great and univer&s;al complaint, it is &s;eldom without &s;ome foundation; and though I have taken much pains in the preceding di&s;cour&s;e to &s;how that they mi&s;take their own wants, that they do not want a circulating medium, but u&s;e that phra&s;e without un|der&s;tanding its meaning; yet they certainly do want &s;omething. They want particularly <HI>credit;</HI> and they look back with de&s;ire to the former times when they had paper money, which, by its name it&s;elf, pointed out its nature and u&s;e, the notes being then called bills of credit.

That it &s;hould not be a legal tender for any debts contracted or to be contracted, but receivable in all taxes within the &s;tate, and pay|able for the wages of Council and A&s;&s;embly, and the fees and perqui&s;ites of all public officers, after it has been &s;o received. (3.) That at the end of twelve calender months, a &s;um preci&s;ely equal to the intere&s;t that had accrued or become due in that time, &s;hould be con&s;umed by fire, and public intimation given of its being done. The &s;ame thing &s;hould be done eve|ry &s;ub&s;equent year. (4) That at no time any part of this money &s;hould be made u&s;e of in the payment of the public debts, but that which had been fir&s;t levied in taxes.

It would, in my opinion, certainly be tried, for all would know that it would pay every tax to government, and even borrowers of large &s;ums might make trial of it, without any ri&s;k <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, becau&s;e, if it would not an&s;wer their end, they might, after a few months, repay it, and take up their mortgage. But I cannot help thinking that the principles of it
<PB N="56" REF="020154_0058_0FADF41814A2C6A0">
are &s;o ju&s;t, and the plan &s;o certain, that all under|&s;tanding per&s;ons would perceive and approve it.</P>
<P>I MUST here take the occa&s;ion and the liberty of &s;aying, that it were greatly to be wi&s;hed that tho&s;e who have in their hands the admini&s;tration of affairs in the &s;everal &s;tates of America, would take no mea|&s;ures, either on this, or any other &s;ubject, but what are founded upon ju&s;tice, &s;upported by rea&s;on, and warranted to be &s;afe by the experience of former ages, and of other countries. The operation of political ca<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> is as uniform and certain as that of natural ca<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">s. And any mea&s;ure which in it&s;elf has a bad tendency, though its effects may not be in&s;tantly di&s;cernable, and their progre&s;s may be but &s;low, yet it will be infallible; and perhaps the danger will then only appear when a remedy is impo&s;&s;ible. This is the ca&s;e, in &s;ome degree, with all political mea&s;ures, without exception, yet I am mi&s;taken if it is not eminently &s;o with re&s;pect to commercial dealings. Commerce is excited, directed, and carried on by intere&s;t. But do not mi&s;take this, it is not carried on by general univer&s;al intere&s;t, nor even by well in|formed national intere&s;t, but by immediate, apparent, and &s;en&s;ible per&s;onal intere&s;t. I mu&s;t al&s;o ob&s;erve, that there is in mankind a &s;harp-&s;ightedne&s;s upon this &s;ubject that is quite a&s;toni&s;hing. All men are not philo&s;ophers but they are generally good judges of their own profit in what is immediately before them, and will uniformly adhere to it. It is not uncommon to &s;ee a man who appears to be almo&s;t as
<PB N="57" REF="020154_0059_0FADF418D373D008">
&s;tupid as a &s;tone, and yet he &s;hall be as adroit and dextrous in making a bargain, or even more &s;o, than a man of the fir&s;t rate under&s;tanding, who, probably for that very rea&s;on, is le&s;s attentive to trifling cir|cum&s;tances, and le&s;s under the government of mean and &s;elfi&s;h views. As to currency, which has been our general &s;ubject, if coins of any particular &s;pe|cies happen, as is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, to pa&s;s at a rate, ever &s;o little higher, in one country, or corner of a country than another, thither they will immedi|ately direct their cour&s;e; and if the matter <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> not attended to, nor the mi&s;take rectified, they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> be all there in a very &s;hort time, and the place which receives them mu&s;t bear the lo&s;s.</P>
<P>I WILL now &s;um up, in &s;ingle propo&s;itions, the &s;ub&s;tance of what has been a&s;&s;erted, and I hope &s;uf|ficiently proved, in the preceding di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) IT ought not to be imputed to accident or caprice, that gold, &s;ilver, and copper, formerly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and the two fir&s;t continue to be, the medium of com|merce; but to their inherent value, joined with other properties, that fit them for circulation. Therefore, all the &s;peculations, formed upon a contrary &s;up<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">|tion, are inconclu&s;ive and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) GOLD and &s;ilver are far from being in too &s;mall quantity at pre&s;ent for the purpo&s;e of a circu|lating medium, in the commercial nations. The la&s;t of them, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> &s;ilver, &s;eems rather to be in too gr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> quantity, &s;o as to become inconvenient for tran&s;por|tation.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="58" REF="020154_0060_0FADF41A0F11C5D8">
(3.) THE people of every nation will get the quan|tity of the&s;e precious metals, that they are entitled to by their indu&s;try, and no more. If by any acci|dent, as plunder in war, or borrowing from other nations, or even finding it in mines, they get more, they will not be able to keep it. It will, in a &s;hort time, find its level. Laws again&s;t exporting the coin will not prevent this. Laws of this kind, though they are &s;till in force in &s;ome nations, &s;uppo&s;ed to be wi&s;e, yet are in them&s;elves ridiculous. If you import more than you export, you mu&s;t pay the ba|lance or give up the trade.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) THE quantity of gold and &s;ilver at any time in a nation, is no evidence of national wealth, unle&s;s you take into con&s;ideration the way in which it came there, and the probability of its continuing.</P>
<P N="5">(5.) No paper of any kind is, properly &s;peaking, money. It ought never to be made a legal tender. It <HI>ought</HI> not to be forced upon <HI>any</HI> body, becau&s;e it <HI>cannot</HI> be forced upon <HI>every</HI> body.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) GOLD and &s;ilver, fairly acquired, and likely to continue, are real national, as well as per&s;onal wealth. If twice as much paper circulates with them, though in full credit, particular per&s;ons may be rich by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the nation in general is not.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) THE <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the &s;carcity of money, is gene|rally putting <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> for the cau&s;e. No bu&s;ine&s;s can be done, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, becau&s;e money is &s;carce. It may be &s;aid with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> truth, money is &s;carce, be|cau&s;e little bu&s;ine&s;s is done. Yet their influence,
<PB N="59" REF="020154_0061_0FADF41A786FB160">
like that of many other cau&s;es&punc; and effects, is reci|procal.</P>
<P N="8">(8.) THE quantity of current money, of whate|ver kind, will have an effect in rai&s;ing the price of indu&s;try, and bringing goods dearer to market, there|fore the increa&s;e of the currency in any nation, by paper, which will not pa&s;s among other nations, makes the fir&s;t co&s;t of every thing they do greater, and of con&s;equence, the profit le&s;s.</P>
<P N="9">(9.) IT is however po&s;&s;ible, that paper obligations may &s;o far facilitate commerce, and extend credit, as by the additional indu&s;try, that they excite, to over|balance the injury which they do in other re&s;pects. Yet even the good it&s;elf may be overdone. Too much money may be emitted even upon loan, but to emit money any other way, then upon loan, is to do all evil, and no good.</P>
<P N="10">(10.) THE exce&s;&s;ive quantity of paper emitted by the different &s;tates of America, will probably be a lo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> to the whole. They cannot however take advantage of one another in that way. That &s;tate which e|mits mo&s;t will lo&s;e mo&s;t, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P N="11">(11.) I can &s;ee no way in which it can do good but one, which is, to deter other nations from tru&s;t|ing us, and thereby le&s;&s;en our importations; and I &s;incerely wi&s;h, that in that way, it may prove in &s;ome degree a remedy for its own evils.</P>
<P N="12">(12.) THOSE who refu&s;e doubtful paper, and thereby di&s;grace it, or prevent its circulation, are not enemies, but friends to their country.</P>

To draw to a conclu&s;ion, it is probable that tho&s;e who perceive, which it will be ea&s;y to do, that the author of this tract is not a merchant or trader by profe&s;&s;ion, will be ready to &s;ay, what has this gen|tleman to do with &s;uch a &s;ubject? Why &s;hould he write upon what he has no practical knowledge of, money and commerce? To the&s;e I an&s;wer, that I have written, not as a merchant, but as a &s;cholar. I profe&s;s to derive my opinions from the be&s;t civilians of this and the la&s;t age, and from the hi&s;tory of all ages, joined with a pretty con&s;iderable experience and attention to the effects of political cau&s;es, within the &s;phere of my own ob&s;ervation.
