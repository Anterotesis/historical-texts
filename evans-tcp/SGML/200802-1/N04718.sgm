<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Candid Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING had the Opportunity of peru&s;ing the following Di&s;|cour&s;es, I do with plea&s;ure re|commend them to the World, as found, &s;ea&s;onable, and &s;olid Compo&s;ures. They appear to me to contain, the <HI>Words of Truth and Soberne&s;s;</HI> and to be well adapted to <HI>correct the Errors</HI> of the pre&s;ent Day, as well as to <HI>promote</HI> vital and practical <HI>Godline&s;s.</HI>&mdash;The Ob&s;er|vations in them are pious, pertinent, and in&s;tructive; and &s;o well &s;uited to the Times we live in, that they are like <HI>Apples of Gold in Pictures of Sil|ver.</HI> The Stile is ea&s;y and natural,
<PB N="iv" REF="005885_0003_10275F59EAD1CAC0">
and the practical Inferences, affectionate and poignant, equally fitted to alarm Sinners, and comfort the Saints of God amid&s;t the various Mi&s;eries that attend their pre&s;ent <HI>Pilgrimage,</HI> thro' this Val|ley of <HI>Tears,</HI> this uncertain and diffi|cult State of Probation. In a Word, I am humbly of Opinion, that the Di&s;|cour&s;es afore&s;aid, are grave and ma&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uline; that they indicate a &s;ober, hum|ble, well-informed Mind, and a warm Heart. I therefore earne&s;tly be&s;eech the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to ble&s;s them to tho&s;e noble Ends for which they are &s;pecially adapted, for the Sake of his dear Son!</P>
<P>Upon hearing the Reverend Author of the afore&s;aid Di&s;cour&s;es, preach fre|quently in this <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ity,</HI> particularly in his la&s;t Vi&s;it, and after frequent Conver|&s;ation with him in private, I find, to my <HI>great</HI> Satisfaction, that he is clear and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound in the great Doctrines of Religion, and preaches exactly agree|able
<PB N="v" REF="005885_0004_10275F5B72FCCF88">
to the <HI>Doctrinal Articles</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> and our <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith,</HI> between which there is the &s;weete&s;t Harmony.&mdash;</P>
<P>It was likewi&s;e peculiarly agreeable to me, to hear the afore&s;aid Gentle|man openly and boldly declare in his publick Di&s;cour&s;es, again&s;t that dete&s;t|able and dangerous Error of the <HI>Anti|nomians,</HI> viz. <HI>That Per&s;ons are actual|ly ju&s;tified before Faith;</HI> which is the <HI>proton p&s;eudos,</HI> or fir&s;t Ri&s;e of all their Abominations.&mdash;</P>
<P>And I think it my Duty, having this Opportunity, to inform the Pub|lick, that the Author of the following Di&s;cour&s;es, has declared <HI>his Sentiments</HI> in this City, again&s;t that perilous <HI>ignis fatuus, Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> (particularly in his la&s;t agreeable Vi&s;it) with equal Zeal; the Quinte&s;&s;ence of which, as I con|ceive, con&s;i&s;ts in following <HI>Impul&s;es,</HI> or our own <HI>Fancy,</HI> as a Rule of Con|duct, without the written Word, while
<PB N="vi" REF="005885_0005_10275F5E57E93358">
the &s;ober U&s;e of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> is rejected; This, the Reverend Mr. WHITEFIELD has expre&s;ly oppo&s;ed and declar'd a|gain&s;t.&mdash;There are &s;ome Things in this faithful Servant of Chri&s;t, which I cannot but admire as very uncom|mon, <HI>viz.</HI> His continued <HI>burning Zeal</HI> for the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of Chri&s;t for &s;o many Years, with but little Interruption comparatively: His <HI>indefatigable La|bours</HI> for God, e&s;pecially in preaching the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel daily, for &s;o long a Space of Time: The <HI>Pre&s;ervation</HI> of his <HI>weak Con&s;titution,</HI> from being entirely <HI>ruin'd</HI> by &s;uch an extraordina|ry Cour&s;e of vehement <HI>Labours</HI> and fatiguing <HI>Travel:</HI> The <HI>Pre&s;ervation</HI> of his <HI>Soul,</HI> from being either quite lifted up, and carried away with <HI>Pride,</HI> in the mid&s;t of &s;o much Popularity and Applau&s;e, or at times quite <HI>&s;unk</HI> in melancholly <HI>De&s;pondency,</HI> under the <HI>Withdrawings</HI> of God's <HI>comfortable Pre&s;ence,</HI> the <HI>Jealou&s;ies</HI> and De&s;ertions
<PB N="vii" REF="005885_0006_10275F6415198CE0">
of dear <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Enemies,</HI> whereby his <HI>Character</HI> has been with Art and Elegance, exceedingly and unju&s;tly blackened; tho'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> by <HI>&s;ome,</HI> at lea&s;t in all Probability, with an hone&s;t Inten|tion: Add to the&s;e Sources of Grief, the Apo&s;tacies of divers promi&s;ing <HI>Profe&s;&s;ors;</HI> &s;ome from the <HI>&s;ound Doc|trines</HI> of Religion, and &s;ome from Truth and practical Godline&s;s both to|gether; with the <HI>fiery Darts</HI> of <HI>Sa|tan's Temptations,</HI> &s;uited to the afore|&s;aid Circum&s;tances of Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I may add to the&s;e, his extraordi|nary <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> in winning poor Sinners to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and building up Saints in Knowledge, Faith, Holi|ne&s;s, and Comfort!</P>
<P>Having had more Opportunities to know <HI>the Fruits</HI> of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">is Labours</HI> in the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI>-Mini&s;try than many others, be|cau&s;e of my <HI>Travels</HI> in <HI>America;</HI> I can freely and &s;afely declare, that I have met with many who have given a
<PB N="viii" REF="005885_0007_10275F6703FFD1A8">
rational and &s;criptural Account of their Conver&s;ion by <HI>his</HI> Mini&s;try, and do crown their Narrative by a holy Prac|tice. I heartily wi&s;h that &s;ome ingeni|ous Gentlemen of Figure and Charac|ter who have wrote again&s;t him, and have po&s;&s;ibly been influenced thereto in a Mea&s;ure, by a wrong Information re&s;pecting &s;ome Particulars in his Preaching and Conduct, had but the Opportunity of hearing him preach frequently, and pray, not only in Pub|lick, but in private, as well as of free Conver&s;ation with him about the Things they object; I cannot but think that they would then alter their Senti|ments concerning him. Surely their Jealou&s;ies would be removed, and their pre&s;ent apparent Aver&s;ion, turned into Wonder and Love. For my own Part, I mu&s;t &s;peak honourably of him, for God's Sake, and for Truth's Sake, &s;hould it co&s;t me never &s;o dear.&mdash;He comes out &s;o clearly, &s;o boldly and
<PB N="ix" REF="005885_0008_10275F688B366838">
prudently, for the &s;weet, &s;weet, &s;weet <HI>Truths</HI> of the <HI>ever-ble&s;&s;ed</HI> LORD JESUS, that it charms my Heart into Admira|tion and Love. If he doth not preach the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, in my humble Opinion, it is not in the Bible. I be|lieve in my Heart, and I think, with &s;ufficient Rea&s;on, that his De&s;igns in travelling are pious and honourable, <HI>viz.</HI> To bring poor Sinners to Chri&s;t, and to build them up in him. And he is for the general, uncommonly en|livened and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his ble&s;&s;ed Ma|&s;ter's Service. He preaches the great Doctrines of the Reformed Churches, <HI>viz. Original Sin, Ju&s;tification by Faith alone, Man's Impotency to do &s;pi|ritual Good, Regeneration, Sanctifica|tion</HI> and <HI>Per&s;everance.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e impor|tant Points he mainly in&s;i&s;ts upon, and that with Clearne&s;s, Pungency, and Pathos.</P>
<P>Moreover, he is <HI>meek</HI> and <HI>patient</HI> in <HI>Sufferings,</HI> and treats his Oppo&s;ers
<PB N="x" REF="005885_0009_10275F6CC6698A60">
with Temper and <HI>Kindne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;In a Word, his whole Life evidently ap|pears to be devoted to Jehovah, and is filled with Acts of Piety towards God, and Mercy towards Mens Souls and Bodies.</P>
<P>Yea, &s;uch is the Vehemence of his De&s;ires to do exten&s;ive and manifold Service to the Church of God, that he is in Danger of lo&s;ing his Life in the Cau&s;e, by a Series of extraordinary Labours (to all Appearance quite di&s;|proportioned to his bodily Strength.) Now what greater Evidence can we have of the Sincerity of any Man than the&s;e? E&s;pecially if we add thereto, his peaceable, healing Di&s;po&s;ition in re&s;pect of the Church of God, and op|po&s;ing Schi&s;ms and Divi&s;ions. What tho' there have been &s;ome exception|able, unguarded Expre&s;&s;ions, in &s;ome of his former Writings? Is this to be wonder'd at, con&s;idering his <HI>young Years, &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ions, Education</HI> in
<PB N="xi" REF="005885_0010_10275F6FA4A38058">
<HI>Arminian Principles,</HI> and the conti|nued <HI>Hurry</HI> of his Labours in Preach|ing, writing Letters, and Di&s;cour&s;ing with People in the Places where he <HI>travell'd</HI> having withal but little Time for Study and Reflection?</P>
<P>Shou'd not that <HI>Charity, that hopes all Things</HI> that are good, as far as there is any Rea&s;on for it, induce us to put a favourable Con&s;truction on them, at lea&s;t on his De&s;igns; e&s;pecially con&s;i|dering that his after Writings &s;et many Things in a better Light?</P>
<P>If every doubtful Expre&s;&s;ion in the Writings of <HI>Luther,</HI> and many other good and great Men, were put upon the Rack by ingenious Pens, and not compared with other Pa&s;&s;ages in the &s;ame, or other of their Performances, their Principles would appear in a &s;able Dre&s;s, and might be ea&s;ily burle&s;qued.</P>
<P>I de&s;ign to offend no Man by this Preface&mdash;I de&s;ire to entertain charita|ble Sentiments of all, as far as I have
<PB N="xii" REF="005885_0011_10275F770AB11750">
Scripture and Rea&s;on for it; and I doubt not, but divers who have oppo&s;ed both the Reverend Mr. WHITEFIELD and my &s;elf, have had a pious and ho|ne&s;t Intention in &s;o doing.&mdash;I only beg leave to expre&s;s my own Opinion, with all due Deference to &s;uch as are otherwi&s;e minded.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to the Conclu&s;ion, and therefore be&s;eech the Reader to peru&s;e, without Prejudice, the follow|ing Di&s;cour&s;es; and to con&s;ider &s;eri|ou&s;ly the Truths contained in them, as well as to apply in particular his own Portion.&mdash;In this Way, he will glorify God, and probably receive &s;pe|cial Benefit to him&s;elf. I add no more, but imploring the Ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven upon thy Endeavours, remain thy Ser|vant for Chri&s;t's Sake.</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH Believers by Nature are far from God, and Children of Wrath, even as others, yet it is a|mazing to think how nigh they are brought to him again by the Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash;Eye hath not &s;een, or Ear heard, nei|ther hath it entered into the Heart of any Man living fully to conceive, the Nearne&s;s and Dearne&s;s of that Relation, in which they &s;tand to their common Head&mdash;He is not a&s;hamed to call them <HI>Brethren&mdash;Behold,</HI> &s;ays the ble&s;|&s;ed Je&s;us in the Days of his Fle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h, <HI>my Mother and my Brethren</HI>&mdash;And again after his Re&s;ur|rection, <HI>Go tell my Brethren.</HI>&mdash;Nay &s;ometimes he is plea&s;ed to term Believers his <HI>Friends&mdash;Henceforth call I you no longer Servants, but Friends&mdash;Our Friend</HI> Lazarus <HI>&s;leepeth</HI>&mdash;And
<PB N="2" REF="005885_0015_10275F830E64E7F0">
what is a Friend? Why "there is a Friend that is nearer than a Brother," nay, as near as one's <HI>own Soul</HI>&mdash;And <HI>thy Friend,</HI> &s;ays God in the Book of <HI>Deuteronomy, which is as thy own Soul.</HI>&mdash;Kind and endearing Appellations the&s;e, that undoubtedly be&s;peak a very near and in|effably intimate Union between the Lord Je|&s;us, and the true living Members to his my|&s;tical Body! But, methinks, the Words of our Text point out to us a Relation, which not only comprehends, but in re&s;pect to Near|ne&s;s and Dearne&s;s, exceeds all other Relations what&s;oever&mdash;I mean that of a <HI>Hu&s;band&mdash;For thy Maker is thy Hu&s;band&mdash;The Lord of Ho&s;ts is his Name, and thy Redeemer the Holy One of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>the God of the whole Earth &s;hall he be called.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>The&s;e Words were originally &s;poken to the People of the <HI>Jews,</HI> con&s;idered collectively as a peculiar People, whom our Lord had be|troth'd and married to him&s;elf; and they &s;eem to be &s;poken when Religion was upon the De|cline among their Churches; when they had, in a great Mea&s;ure, lo&s;t that Life and Power, which they once experienced; and their Ene|mies began to in&s;ult them with a <HI>Where is now your God?</HI> Such a State of Things mu&s;t un|doubtedly be very afflicting to the true Mour|ners in <HI>Zion;</HI> and, no doubt, put them upon crying unto the Lord, in this their deep Di|&s;tre&s;s&mdash;He hears their Prayer&mdash;His Bowels
<PB N="3" REF="005885_0016_10275F87848420C0">
yearn towards them; and, in the preceding Ver&s;e, he a&s;&s;ures them, that tho' the Enemy had broken in upon them like a Flood, yet their Extremity &s;hould be his Opportunity to lift up a Standard again&s;t him&mdash;<HI>Fear not,</HI> &s;ays the great Head and King of his Church, <HI>for thou &s;halt not be a&s;hamed,</HI> that is, <HI>finally</HI> or <HI>totally; neither be thou confounded, i. e.</HI> di&s;&s;ipated, or dejected, giving up all for gone, as though thou never &s;hould&s;t &s;ee better Days, or ano|ther Revival of Religion; <HI>for thou &s;halt not</HI> entirely <HI>be put to Shame,</HI> tho' for a while, for thy Humiliation, and the greater Confu&s;i|on of thy Adver&s;aries, I &s;uffer them to tri|umph over thee: <HI>For,</HI> &s;ays the Lord, <HI>thou &s;halt forget the Shame of thy Youth, and &s;halt not remember the Reproach of thy Widow-hood any more; i. e.</HI> I will vouch&s;afe you &s;uch ano|ther glorious Gale of my ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, that you &s;hall quite forget your former troubled Widow-&s;tate, and give your Enemies no more Occa&s;ion to in&s;ult you, on Account of your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">nt-condition, but rather to envy you, and gna&s;h their Teeth, and melt away at the Sight of your unthought-of Glory and Pro&s;perity.&mdash;And why will the infinitely great and conde|&s;cending Je&s;us deal thus with his People? Be|cau&s;e the Church is <HI>his Spou&s;e&mdash;For,</HI> &s;ays he, in the Words ju&s;t now read to you, <HI>thy Maker is thy Husband, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of</HI> I&s;rael; and therefore he loves thee too
<PB N="4" REF="005885_0017_10275F8A6AB40D78">
well, to let thy Enemies always trample thee under Foot&mdash;<HI>The Lord of Ho&s;ts is his Name, the God of the whole Earth &s;hall he be called;</HI> and therefore he is armed with &s;ufficient Pow|er to relieve his oppre&s;&s;ed People, and over|come and avenge him&s;elf of all their haughty and in&s;ulting Foes.&mdash;</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be the prime and genuine Interpretation of the Text and Context, e&s;pe|cially if we add, that they may have a further View to the latter-day Glory, and that ble&s;&s;ed State of the Church, which the People of God have been looking for in all Ages, and the &s;peedy Approach of which, we undoubt|edly pray for, when we put up that Petition of our Lord's, <HI>viz. Thy Kingdom come.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>But, tho' the Words were originally &s;poken to the <HI>Jews,</HI> yet they are undoubtedly appli|cable to all Believers in all Ages, and, when inlarged on in a proper Manner, will afford us &s;uitable Matter of Di&s;cour&s;e both for Sin|ners and for Saints; for &s;uch as know God, as well as &s;uch who know him not; and likewi&s;e for tho&s;e, who once walked in the Light of his ble&s;&s;ed Countenance, but are now back&s;lidden from him; have their Harps hung upon the Willows, and are afraid that their Beloved is gone, and will return to their Souls no more.&mdash;Accordingly, without prefacing this Di&s;cour&s;e any farther, as I &s;uppo&s;e a mix'd Multitude of Saints, unconverted Sinners, and

Back&s;liders, are pre&s;ent here this Day, I &s;hall endeavour &s;o to &s;peak from the Words of the Text, that each may have a proper Portion, and none be &s;ent empty away.&mdash;</P>
<P>In pro&s;ecuting this De&s;ign, I will

<ITEM>II. The Duties of Love which they owe to our Lord, who &s;tand in &s;o near a Relation to him.&mdash;</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. The mi&s;erable Condition of &s;uch as can|not yet &s;ay, <HI>their Maker is their Hu&s;band.</HI>&mdash;</ITEM>
<ITEM>And IV. I &s;hall conclude with a general Exhortation to all &s;uch unhappy Souls, to come and match with the dear Lord Je&s;us.&mdash;And Oh! may that God who ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Abra|ham'</HI>s Servant, when he went out to &s;eek a Wife for his Son <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> ble&s;s me, even me al&s;o, now I am come, I tru&s;t, relying on divine Strength, to invite poor Sinners, and recal Back&s;liders to my Ma&s;ter Je&s;us!&mdash;</ITEM>

<P>But, before I proceed to this, it may not be improper to ob&s;erve, that if any of you, among&s;t whom I am now preaching the King|dom of God, are Enemies to inward Religion,
<PB N="6" REF="005885_0019_10275F8D78596E28">
