<P>THE mo&s;t high God, being as merciful as ju&s;t, has been care|ful in his word, to encourage, &s;upport, and comfort his peo|ple with gracious promi&s;es, no le&s;s than to alarm, check, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ter his enemies by the mo&s;t awful threats. The pa&s;&s;age of holy writ now read is an evidence of this. The chapter from which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is taken contains a valedictory <HI>&s;ong,</HI> which Mo&s;es by the appoint|ment of God, delivered to the Children of I&s;rael, a li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> before his death.

In this <HI>&s;ong</HI> he not only admoni&s;hes and reproves them for their ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tacy from God, but predicts the puni&s;hments which their &s;ins would bring upon them. At the &s;ame time he promi&s;es, in the text, and context, that de&s;truction &s;hall eventually come upon their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and oppre&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs.

to plead their cau&s;e and break the yoke of oppre&s;&s;ion under which they may groan: that, in&s;tead of vi&s;iting them in judgment as they de&s;erve for their &s;inful back&s;lidings, he will forgive, protect and &s;ave them. <HI>Repenting him&s;elf for his &s;ervants,</HI> is an expre&s;&s;ion which &s;hows, not that God changes his purpo&s;es and is fickle like men, but that he will forgive the &s;ins of his people and not deal with them according to their de&s;erts. <HI>And when the Lord rai&s;ed them up judges, then the Lord was with the judge, and delivered them out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hand of their enemies, all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the judge; for it repented the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> becau&s;e of their groanings, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y rea&s;on of them that oppre&s;&s;ed them and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judges ii.18.</NOTE> <HI>And God &s;aw their works, that they turned from their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; and God repented of the evil, that he had &s;aid that he would do unto them, and he did it not.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jonah iii 10.</NOTE></P>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. We are naturally led<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y the denunciation of judgment in the text, to con&s;ider the awfully alarming &s;tate of wicked, im|pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tent men. They are con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to de&s;truction, as one who walks on &s;lippery ground, is every &s;tep which he takes, in danger of falling. The very manner in which de&s;truction is to come upon them &s;hows their continual danger. For, &s;aith the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>&s;urely thou did&s;t &s;et them in &s;lippery places, and thou ca&s;ted&s;t them down into de&s;truction.</HI></P>
<P>Their &s;tate is the more awful, as they are expo&s;ed to &s;udden and unexpected ruin. If a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enture on &s;lippery ground, he is not only liable every moment to fall, but when his foot does &s;lide, it is in&s;tantaneous, and he falls without warning. The rea&s;on why they have not already fallen is becau&s;e God in mercy hath held them up. But in due time their foot <HI>&s;hall</HI> &s;lide. When they &s;hall have proceeded in the commi&s;&s;ion of crime after crime again&s;t God and human &s;ociety, till the mea&s;ure of their iniquities be full, then the mo&s;t high God, will in his providence, no longer hold them up in their walks upon &s;lippery ground, where they never had any leave to venture, but let them &s;ink under the weight of their &s;ins into merited contempt and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>In order more fully to illu&s;trate this truth, that impenitently
<PB N="7" REF="033979_0006_0FF9F3DDE8A4B190">
wicked, and immoral men will be detected and puni&s;hed, let me propo&s;e the following things for con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. There is no want of power in God to begin the infliction of that puni&s;hment upon &s;uch per&s;ons, which they de&s;erve, at any time, when he plea&s;es. Feeble mortals can make no re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t an omnipotent arm. Though earthly princes have fre|quently found it difficult to &s;ubdue a rebel when he has fortified and made him&s;elf &s;trong; yet no fortre&s;s nor numbers can avail any thing again&s;t almighty God. If hand join in hand, and ever &s;o many in malevolence combine again&s;t him, they are ea&s;ily bro|ken and de&s;troyed. They are like a rope of &s;and,&mdash;feeble as the chaff before a driving &s;torm;&mdash;the drie&s;t &s;tubble in the field, is not more ea&s;ily con&s;umed by the raging of an uncontroled fire. <HI>Be|hold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the &s;mall du&s;t of the ballance.</HI> However ea&s;y it may be for us, to cru&s;h the worm, which crawls under our feet, upon the ground, or to cut the thread by which any thing is &s;u&s;pended in the air, &s;till with infinitely more ea&s;e, the Almighty can de&s;troy his enemies. What is man, that he &s;hould pre&s;ume to think of re&s;i&s;ting God, at who&s;e rebuke the earth trembles, and before whom the mountains are levelled.</P>
<P N="2">2ndly. Another con&s;ideration which &s;hows that impenitent, di&s;obedient men, will be overtaken in their career of vice, and puni&s;hed, is, that this they de&s;erve. Such are their crimes again&s;t God and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that they de&s;erve, and have rea&s;on to expect this, as a reward for their evil deeds. That ju&s;tice to which a holy God mu&s;t always have a &s;acred regard, will not &s;tand in the way; nor be any objection to his executing vengeance upon them. But de&s;erving puni&s;hment, ju&s;tice will rather demand that they &s;hould &s;uffer. To every tree in the garden, which bringeth forth the fruit of Sodom and Gomorrah, the language of ju&s;tice, is, <HI>cut it down; why cumbereth it the</HI> ground? Being under the &s;entence of condemnation, the &s;word of ju&s;tice already hangs over their heads. The law of God, which he has e&s;tabli&s;hed as a rule of righteous|ne&s;s, condemns them; for <HI>he that believeth not is condemned already.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3rdly. It is a con&s;ideration of importance that impenitent, di&s;|obedient men, are now under the very &s;ame <HI>kind</HI> of divine di&s;plea|&s;ure, as God exerci&s;es towards tho&s;e whom he puni&s;hes in the re|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ns of de&s;pair. The rea&s;on why, by human laws they are not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tected, and condemned, is not becau&s;e God is unoffended at their crimes: The rea&s;on why they do not immediately &s;ink down into mi&s;ery, is no proof of their innocence. Perhaps the divine being is now more di&s;plea&s;ed with them, than with &s;ome, who for thou&s;ands of years have been &s;uffering in <HI>the place of torment.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="033979_0007_0FF9C93A30C1EF00">
For &s;ome now living, not only may be impenitent, but much more guil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y: and though God's di&s;plea&s;ure will be made much more manife&s;t in the future than in the pre&s;ent world, yet, his di&s;plea&s;ure is always in proportion to the creature's criminality.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding there are &s;ome hardened per&s;ons who think them&s;elves &s;afe in continuing a vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious cour&s;e, becau&s;e le&s;s-guil|ty in their opinion than their companions, yet they ought to con|fide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that they may now be much more criminal than &s;ome who have long &s;ince peri&s;hed, and therefore are under the greater di&s;plea|&s;ure of God. But if guilty in a greater or le&s;s degree, as God hateth iniquity, their mi&s;ery &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umbereth not: as he loves the ju&s;|tice of his law, though for the pre&s;ent they be permitted to e&s;cape the vigilant attempts of human &s;ociety to detect them, &s;till God hath opened a pit of de&s;truction under their foot, into which in due time they mu&s;t fall.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. Still further to illu&s;trate the truth, that impenitent, vicious men mu&s;t fall in due time, let me &s;ugge&s;t, that they have nothing on which to depend for &s;afety, protection, and &s;al|vation. If the thief, the murderer, the man of lewdne&s;s, or any other &s;inner, &s;hould &s;ee nothing which is likely in his opinion, to be the means or his detection and puni&s;hment: this however is no evidence but there are means now operating which will &s;peedily bring his works of darkne&s;s to light, unto his utter confu&s;ion and ruin. It is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that as God has appointed the end, he has al&s;o appointed the means. If a man walk on &s;lip|pery ground, he mu&s;t be blind, not to &s;ee his danger and the means which are likely to effectuate his fall. To bring this to pa&s;s, there is no need of a miracle, or that any thing extraordina|ry &s;hould take place. It is in vain that they cry peace, and &s;afe|ty; for the highe&s;t authority has long &s;ince a&s;&s;ured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, that to the wicked there is no peace.</P>
<P>Their own care, cunning and &s;ecret artifice, or the mo&s;t dili|gent precaution and vigilance of others can be no certain &s;ecurity to them. Self-conceited, and worldly-wi&s;e men are often taken in their own craftine&s;s.

Like the practical athei&s;t and the villain among men, they cannot, upon &s;eeing that their own care, vigi|lance, and contrivances are weak and likely to fail, fly to any di|vine promi&s;e for &s;afety and protection.

<P>BRETHREN and FRIENDS:</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s on which we are this day convened, is of the mo&s;t &s;olemn and awful nature:&mdash;to &s;ee, one of our fellow-men, and fellow &s;inners, receive the ju&s;t recompence of his crimes.

<P>If only &s;uch crimes be committed by any of you as by our laws are not puni&s;hable with death, yet you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that the &s;malle&s;t indulgence in &s;in &s;ubjects men to the condemnation of God's law. <HI>Cur&s;ed is every one, that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</HI> Think not fi|nally to e&s;cape, without repentance and reformation, neither be|cau&s;e undetected you have aleady gone great lengths in &s;in, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> becau&s;e your crimes, if known, do not &s;ubject you to a &s;hameful death. The natural tendency of all &s;in is to ruin. It is owing to the re&s;training grace of God, that we have not been de&s;troyed by iniquity. What but the re&s;training grace of God, has made us to differ, in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, from the unhappy pri&s;oner&punc; What is it owing to but this, that we have not committed the mo&s;t enormous crimes, become "&s;pectacles to the world, loaded with chains, and brought forth the pri&s;oners of ju&s;tice,' to &s;uffer as ma|lefactors. Were it not for the re&s;traint, "the embargo, which God puts upon men's lu&s;ts," their wickedne&s;s would con&s;titute a hell upon earth.</P>
<P>If you would have God for your judge, <HI>who repenteth him&s;elf fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his &s;ervants,</HI> to defend, forgive and ble&s;s you, with penitent hearts for&s;ake every wicked and fal&s;e way.

Believing it con&s;i&s;tent with the plan of divine mercy in the redemption of men, for God to &s;ave him, if truly penitent, you can pray for him as his di&s;tre&s;&s;ing condition requires. Go not to the place of execution merely to &s;ee an awful, unu&s;ual exhibition, and to gratify vain curio&s;ity; but whatever injury the criminal may have done you, or others, now pity and forgive him: leave him indeed to fall a vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tim to the ju&s;t laws of our country&punc; but lend him the aid of your fervent prayers in the tribulation and agony of his la&s;t moments.</P>
