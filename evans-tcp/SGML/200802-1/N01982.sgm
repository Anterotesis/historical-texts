<P>I.

The Great <HI>Fernelius,</HI> one of the mo&s;t Illu&s;trious Men that ever &s;hone among them, (Writing, <HI>De Abditis rerum Cau&s;is</HI>) gives a very Lively De&s;cription of it.

<HI>VII.</HI> WE have &s;ometimes been led by our <HI>Micro&s;copes,</HI> into &s;ome Apprehen&s;ions, That our <HI>Bodies</HI> are Originally folded up, in In|conceivably Minute <HI>Corpu&s;culicunicules;</HI> and that Generation is nothing but the <HI>Evolution</HI> of the <HI>Stamina</HI> &s;o Involved: Which Operati|on is carried on, by <HI>filling them up</HI> with a mat|ter agreeable to them, till they have an Aug|mentation to the utmo&s;t Extent of the Di|men&s;ions, that they can reach unto: And that the <HI>Re&s;urrection of the Dead,</HI> which is in the Sacred Scriptures called, <HI>A Filling of the Dead Bodies,</HI> will find out the Old <HI>Stamina</HI> of the For&s;aken Body, again Shrunk up into its fir&s;t Parvity, and Repleni&s;h it with a more <HI>Etherial Matter,</HI> fit for the Coele&s;tial Em|ployments and Enjoyments intended for it.

<P><HI>XVIII.</HI> IT is Probable, that when we Dy, the <HI>Ni&s;hmath-Chajim,</HI> goes away, as a Vehicle to the <HI>Rational Soul;</HI> and continues unto it an In&s;trument of many Operations. Here we have &s;ome Solution for the Difficulties, about <HI>Place,</HI> and the <HI>Change</HI> of it, for &s;uch an <HI>Imma|terial Spirit</HI> as the <HI>Rational Soul;</HI> And &s;ome Account for <HI>Apparitions</HI> of the <HI>Dead:</HI> The <HI>Spectres,</HI> which are called both, <HI>Spirits,</HI> and <HI>Phanta&s;ms,</HI> in our <HI>Go&s;pel.</HI> Yea, We are cer|tain of it, That Per&s;ons before they have <HI>Died,</HI> upon &s;trong De&s;ires to Vi&s;it and Behold &s;ome Objects at a Di&s;tance from the <HI>Place</HI> to which they were now Confined, have been thrown into a <HI>Trance,</HI> wherein they have lain &s;ome Con&s;iderable. While without <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> or <HI>Breath;</HI> and then Returning, have reported what they have &s;een. But inconte&s;tible Wit|ne&s;&s;es have depo&s;ed, that <HI>in This Time,</HI> they were actually Seen at the <HI>Place,</HI> which they affirmed they had gone unto.</P>
<P>AND here al&s;o we do a little under&s;tand, how our Apo&s;tle in the Raptures (which the Scoffing <HI>Lucian</HI> derides him for) wherein he &s;uppo&s;es he might be <HI>Out of the Body,</HI> yet he <HI>heard Words;</HI> he was yet <HI>Sen&s;ible</HI> of <HI>Occurrences.</HI></P>

there are many things, which, becau&s;e they are <HI>Hard to be Under&s;tood&punc;</HI> the <HI>Epicurian-Sad|ducees</HI> content them&s;elves, in their Swini&s;h Manner, only to Laugh at. But the <HI>Ni&s;h|math-Chajim</HI> well under&s;tood, would give us a marvellous Key to let us into the Philo&s;o|phy of them.</P>
<P><HI>XX.</HI> AND now, for &s;ome Important Con|&s;equences.</P>
<P>MOST Certainly, the Phy&s;icians that can find out Remedies (particularly in the <HI>Mine|ral</HI> or <HI>Vegitable</HI> Kingdom) that &s;hall have a more Immediate Efficacy to Brighten, and Strengthen, &amp; Comfort, the <HI>Ni&s;hmath-Chajim,</HI> will be the mo&s;t Succe&s;sful Phy&s;ician in the World. E&s;pecially, if he can Irradiate the Spirit in the <HI>Stomach,</HI> he will <HI>do Wonderfully.</HI></P>
<P>THOSE things al&s;o, which Fortify the <HI>Blood,</HI> and re&s;tore a <HI>Volatil Ferment,</HI> in the Vapid and Languid <HI>Blood,</HI> will do Wonders for us. It is impo&s;&s;ible to Kill a Man (the <HI>Ni&s;hmath-Chajim</HI> will never leave him) till the Circulation of his <HI>Blood</HI> be ruined.</P>
<P><HI>XXI.</HI> WE read, <HI>Heavine&s;s in the Heart of man makes it stoop; but a Good Word makes it Glad.</HI> We read, <HI>A Chearful Heart does good like a Medicine; but a broken &s;pirit dries the Bones.</HI> The Invigoration, or the Debilita|tion of the <HI>Ni&s;hmath-Chajim,</HI> is that wherein the&s;e ancient Ob&s;ervations are accompli&s;hed.</P>

IT is a Remark of <HI>Baglivi,</HI> but it may have been made by Ten Thou&s;and more; <Q>That a great part of our <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> Either do Ri&s;e from, or are Fed by, a Weight of <HI>Cares,</HI> lying on the <HI>Minds</HI> of men. <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> that &s;eem Incurable, are ea&s;ily Cured by agree|able <HI>Conver&s;ation.</HI> Di&s;orders of the <HI>Mind,</HI> fir&s;t bring Di&s;ea&s;es on the <HI>Stomach;</HI> and &s;o the whole Ma&s;s of <HI>Blood</HI> gradually becomes infected.

THE Sagacious Dr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> &s;eems to have the Scent of our <HI>Ni&s;hmath-Chajim,</HI> when he tells us, That as the <HI>Outward Man</HI> is fram'd with Parts, obvious to <HI>Sen&s;e,</HI> thus the <HI>Inward Man</HI> does con&s;i&s;t of a due <HI>Series,</HI> and as it were a <HI>Fabric,</HI> or <HI>Spirits,</HI> to be view'd only by the Eye of Rea&s;on: And as this is united with the Con&s;titution of the <HI>Body,</HI> &s;o the <HI>Frame</HI> of it is more or le&s;s ea&s;ily Di&s;or|dered, by how much the <HI>Con&s;titution of the Spirits</HI> is more or le&s;s Firm within us. And that the Origin of the <HI>Splenetic</HI> and <HI>Hy&s;teric</HI> Ataxy in the <HI>Body</HI> is a <HI>Feeble Con&s;titution </HI> of the <HI>Spirits,</HI> and the breaking of their <HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI> &s;o that they are ea&s;ily Di&s;&s;ipated, or have an Unequal Di&s;tribution.</P>
<P>THESE Maladies have many Symptoms, which may &s;erve as <HI>Diagno&s;ticks</HI> for them; E&s;pecially the&s;e Two: That the <HI>Urine</HI> is Clear, Limpid, &amp; Copious. And, That the Patient is <HI>Chiefly affected</HI> with his Indi&s;po&s;itions, when he has ju&s;t had his <HI>Mind</HI> under &s;ome Di&s;tur|bance and Affliction.</P>
<P>IT is Plain, that the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es are not main|ly in the <HI>Humours;</HI> inasmuch as <HI>Evacuations</HI> do not Relieve, but fearfully Produce &amp; Increa&s;e the Di&s;ea&s;es.

THE Cure is; Fir&s;t, <HI>Quiet</HI> the <HI>Spirits</HI> with Proper <HI>Anodynes.</HI> Then bring them to Rights, and Revive them &amp; Refre&s;h them, &amp; bring a <HI>New Strength</HI> into them.
