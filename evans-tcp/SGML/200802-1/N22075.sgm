<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE general de&s;ign of the&s;e pages is to offer &s;ome cur&s;ory remarks on the pre|&s;ent &s;tate of religion among a great part of the polite and the fa&s;hionable; not only a|mong that de&s;cription of per&s;ons who, whe|ther from di&s;belief, or whatever other cau&s;e, avowedly neglect the duties of Chri&s;tianity; but among that more decent cla&s;s al&s;o, who, while they acknowledge their belief of its truth by a public profe&s;&s;ion, and are not inat|tentive to any of its forms, yet exhibit little of its &s;pirit in their general temper and conduct:
<PB REF="029103_0004_0FDF9B049B570DD0">
to &s;hew that Chri&s;tianity, like its divine Au|thor, is not only <HI>denied</HI> by tho&s;e who in words di&s;own their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to its authori|ty; but <HI>betrayed</HI> by &s;till more treacherous di&s;ciples, even while they &s;ay, <HI>Hail, Ma&s;ter</HI>!</P>
<P>For this vi&s;ible declen&s;ion of piety, various rea&s;ons have been a&s;&s;igned, &s;ome of which however do not &s;eem fully adequate to the effects a&s;cribed to them. The author of a late popular pamphlet <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hints to an a&s;&s;ociation, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> has accounted for the increa&s;ed profligacy of the <HI>common people,</HI> by a&s;cribing it, very ju&s;tly, to the increa&s;ed di&s;|&s;olutene&s;s of their &s;uperiors; and who will deny what he affirms&mdash;that the general con|duct of high and low receives a deep tincture of depravity from the growing neglect of public wor&s;hip? I mu&s;t however take the li|berty to di&s;&s;ent from his opinion as to the cau&s;e of that neglect; and to &s;u&s;pect that the too common de&s;ertion of per&s;ons of rank from the &s;ervice of the E&s;tabli&s;hment is not occa|&s;ioned, in general, by their di&s;approbation of the Liturgy; but that the far greater part <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them are deterred from going to church by motives far removed from &s;peculative ob|jections and con&s;cientious &s;cruples.</P>
<P>Far be it from me to enter the unplea&s;ant and boundle&s;s fields of controver&s;y; an enter|prize for which it would be hard to &s;ay whe|ther I have le&s;s ability or inclination. Far be it from me to &s;tand forth the fierce champion of a Liturgy, or the prejudiced advocate of
<PB N="3" REF="029103_0005_0FDF9B3394685998">
forms and &s;y&s;tems. A &s;incere member of the E&s;tabli&s;hment my&s;elf, I re&s;pect its in&s;titutions without idolatry, and acknowledge its imper|fections without palliation.</P>
<P>But the difference of opinion here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is not &s;o much about the Liturgy it&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> its imagined effects in thinning the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> our people of fa&s;hion. The &s;lighte&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of ob&s;ervation &s;eems to contradict this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">: tho&s;e however who maintain the other opinion may &s;atisfy their doubts, by enquir|ing whether the regular and &s;y&s;tematic ab&s;en|ters from the church are chiefly to be found among the thinking, the reading, the &s;pecu|lative, and the &s;crupulous part of mankind.</P>
<P>Even the mo&s;t negligent attendant on pub|lic wor&s;hip mu&s;t know, that the obnox<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> creed, to who&s;e malignant potency this gene|ral de&s;ertion is a&s;cribed, is never read above three or four Sundays in the year; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> does not &s;eem a very adequate rea&s;on for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ni&s;hing the mo&s;t &s;crupulous and tender <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">+&s;ciences from church on the other eight and-forty Sundays.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there is one te&s;t which is ab&s;olute|ly unequivocal&mdash;it is never read at all in the <HI>afternoon,</HI> any more than the Litany (another great &s;ource of offence); and yet, with all the&s;e multiplied rea&s;ons for their attendance, that is a &s;ea&s;on when the pews of the fa&s;hion|able world are not <HI>remarkable</HI> for being crowded.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="029103_0006_0FDF9B06CF6D18C0">
On the contrary, is it not pretty evident that the general quarrel (with &s;ome few ex|ceptions) of tho&s;e who habitually ab&s;ent them&s;elves from public wor&s;hip, is not with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reed, but the Commandments? With &s;uch, to reform the Prayer Book would go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> little way, unle&s;s the New Te&s;tament <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be al&s;o abridged. Cut, and pare, and prone the &s;ervice of the Church ever &s;o much, &s;till Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf will be found full of formidable objections. With &s;uch objectors, it would avail but little that the Church &s;hould give up her ab&s;tru&s;e creeds, unle&s;s the Bible would expunge tho&s;e rigorous laws, which not only prohibit &s;inful actions, but corrupt inclinations. And, to &s;peak hone&s;t|ly, I do not &s;ee how &s;uch per&s;ons as habitually infringe the laws of virtue and &s;obriety, and who yet are men of acute &s;agacity, accu&s;tom|ed on other &s;ubjects to a con&s;i&s;tent train of rea&s;oning; who &s;ee con&s;equences in their cau&s;es; who behold practical &s;elf-denial ne|ce&s;&s;arily involved in the &s;incere habit of reli|gious ob&s;ervances&mdash;I do not &s;ee how, to &s;uch men, any doctrines reformed, any redundan|cies lopped, any ob&s;curities brightened, could effect this author's very benevolent and chri&s;|tian wi&s;h.</P>
<P>For religious duties are often neglected up|on more con&s;i&s;tent grounds than the friends of religion are willing to allow. They are often di&s;continued, not as repugnant to the under&s;tanding, not as repul&s;ive to the judg|ment,
<PB N="5" REF="029103_0007_0FDF9B3A364A1628">
but as ho&s;tile to a licentious life. And when a prudent man, after entering into a &s;o|lemn convention, finds that he is living in a con&s;tant breach of every article of the treaty he has engaged to ob&s;erve; one cannot much wonder at his getting out of the hearing of the heavy artillery which he knows is planted a|gain&s;t him, and again&s;t every one who lives in an allowed infraction of the covenant.</P>
<P>A man of &s;en&s;e, who &s;hould acknowledge the truth of the doctrine, would find him&s;elf obliged to &s;ubmit to the force of the precept. Is it not ea&s;y to be a comfortable &s;inner, with|out trying, at lea&s;t, to be a confirmed unbe|liever. The &s;malle&s;t remains of faith would embitter a life of libertini&s;m; and to him who retains any impre&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, the wilde&s;t fe&s;tivals of intemperance will be converted into the terrifying fea&s;t of Damo|cles: the &s;u&s;pended &s;word may every mo|ment fall.</P>
<P>That many a worthy nonconformi&s;t is kept out of the pale of the E&s;tabli&s;hment by &s;ome of the cau&s;es noticed in the pamphlet in que&s;|tion, cannot be doubted; and that many candid members of that E&s;tabli&s;hment regret the cau&s;es which exclude the others, cannot be denied. But the&s;e are often &s;ober thin|kers, &s;erious enquirers, con&s;cientious rea&s;on|ers; who&s;e object is truth, and who &s;pare no pains in &s;earch of what they take to <HI>be</HI> truth. But that the &s;ame objections bani&s;h the great
<PB N="6" REF="029103_0008_0FDF9B0D1E48F1E8">
and the gay, is not equally evident. Thanks to the indolence and di&s;&s;ipation of the times, it is not dogmas or doctrines, it is not ab&s;tract rea&s;oning or puzzling propo&s;itions, it is not perplexed argument or intricate metaphy&s;ics, which can now di&s;incline from Chri&s;tianity; &s;o far from it, they cannot even allure to un|belief. Infidelity it&s;elf, with all that &s;trong and natural bias which pa&s;&s;ion and appetite have in its favour, if it appear in the grave and &s;chola&s;tic form of &s;peculation, argument, or philo&s;ophical deduction, may lie almo&s;t as quietly on the &s;helf as its mo&s;t able antago|ni&s;t; and the cobwebs are almo&s;t as &s;eldom bru&s;hed from Hobbes as from Hooker. No: prudent &s;ceptici&s;m has wi&s;ely &s;tudied the tem|per of the times, and &s;kilfully felt the pul&s;e of this relaxed and indolent age. It prudently accommodated it&s;elf to the reigning charac|ter, when it adopted &s;arca&s;m in&s;tead of rea|&s;oning, and preferred a &s;neer to an argument. It di&s;creetly judged, that, if it would now gain pro&s;elytes, it mu&s;t &s;hew it&s;elf under the bewitching form of a profane bonmot; mu&s;t be interwoven in the texture of &s;ome amu&s;|ing hi&s;tory, written with the levity of a ro|mance, and the point and glitter of an epi|gram: it mu&s;t embelli&s;h the ample margin with &s;ome offen&s;ive anecdote or impure allu|&s;ion, and decorate impiety with every loo&s;e and meretricious ornament of a corrupt ima|gination: it mu&s;t break up the old flim&s;y &s;y&s;tem into little mi&s;chievous aphori&s;ms, rea|dy

<P>Philo&s;ophy therefore (as Unbelief, by a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tent of its own creation, has lately been plea&s;|ed to call it&s;elf) will not do nearly &s;o much mi&s;chief to the pre&s;ent age, as its great apo&s;|tles intended: &s;ince it requires time, applica|tion, and patience to peru&s;e the rea&s;oning ve|terans of the &s;ceptic &s;chool; and the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> talents not now very &s;everely devoted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of any &s;ort, by tho&s;e who give the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fa&s;hion; e&s;pecially &s;ince, as it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, the &s;ame principles may be acquired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> cheaper terms, and the reputation of be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> philo&s;ophers, obtained without the &s;acrifices of plea&s;ure for the &s;everities of &s;tudy; &s;ince the indu&s;try of our literary chymi&s;ts has ex|tracted the &s;pirit from the gro&s;s &s;ub&s;tance of the old unvendible poi&s;on, and exhibite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the volatile e&s;&s;ence of a few &s;prightly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ings.</P>
<P>If therefore, in this voluptuous age, when a frivolous and relaxing di&s;&s;ipation has infect|ed our very &s;tudies, infidelity will not be at the pains of deep re&s;earch and elaborate inve&s;|tigation, even on &s;uch &s;ubjects as are conge|nial to its affections, it is vain to expect that chri&s;tianity will be more engaging, either as an object of &s;peculation, or a rule of practice, when its evidences require attention to be comprehended, its doctrines humility to be

received, and its precepts &s;elf-denial to be em|braced.</P>
<P>Will it then be uncharitable to pronounce, that the leading evil, not which thins our churches (for that is not the evil I propo&s;e to con&s;ider) but which pervades our whole character, and gives the colour to our gene|ral conduct, is <HI>practical irreligion</HI>? an irreli|gion not &s;o much oppo&s;ed to a &s;peculative faith, as to that &s;pirit, temper, and beha|viour, which chri&s;tianity inculcates.</P>
<P>On this practical irreligion it is propo&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> a few hints. After attempting to &s;hew, by a compari&s;on with the religion of the great in preceding ages, that there is a vi|&s;ible decline of piety among the higher ranks &mdash;that even tho&s;e more liberal &s;pirits who neglect not many of the great duties of bene|volence, yet hold the &s;everer obligations of piety in no e&s;teem&mdash;I &s;hall proceed, though perhaps with two little method, to remark on the notorious <HI>effects</HI> of the decay of this re|ligious principle, as it corrupts our mode of education, infects our dome&s;tic conduct, &s;preads the contagion downwards among &s;er|vants and inferiors, and influences our man|ners, habits, and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>But what it is here propo&s;ed principally to in&s;i&s;t on is, that this defect of religious prin|ciples is almo&s;t equally fatal, whether it ap|pear in the open contempt of all &s;acred in&s;ti|tutions, or under the more decent veil of ex|ternal ob&s;ervances, un&s;upported by &s;uch a
<PB N="9" REF="029103_0011_0FDF9B3DA20DC600">
conduct as is analogous to the chri&s;tian pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall proceed with a few remarks on a third cla&s;s of fa&s;hionable characters, who pro|fe&s;s to acknowledge chri&s;tianity as a perfect &s;y&s;tem of morals, while they deny its divine authority: and conclude with &s;ome &s;light a|nimadver&s;ions on the opinion which the&s;e maintain, that morality is the whole of reli|gion.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, however, that man|ners and principles act reciprocally on each other; and are, by turns, cau&s;e and effect. For in&s;tance&mdash;the increa&s;ed relaxation of mo|rals, produces the increa&s;ed neglect of infu|&s;ing religious principles in the education of youth: which effect becomes, in its turn, a cau&s;e; and in due time, when that cau&s;e comes to operate, helps on the decline of manners.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Decline of chri&s;tianity &s;hewn by a comparative view of the religion of the great, in preceding ages.</HEAD>
<P>IF the general po&s;ition of this little tract be allowed, namely, that religion is at pre&s;ent in no very flouri&s;hing &s;tate among tho&s;e, who&s;e example, from the high ground on which they &s;tand, guides and governs the re&s;t of mankind: it will not be denied by tho&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> are ever &s;o &s;uperficially acquainted with the hi&s;tory of our country, that this has not always been the ca&s;e. Tho&s;e who make a fair compari&s;on mu&s;t allow, that however the pre&s;ent age may be improved in other impor|tant and valuable advantages, yet that there is but little appearance remaining among the great and the powerful of that "righteou&s;|ne&s;s which exalteth a nation;"&mdash;that there has been a <HI>moral revolution</HI> in the national manners and principles, very little analagous to that great <HI>political</HI> one of which we hear &s;o much; that our public virtue bears little pro|portion to our public ble&s;&s;ings, and that our religion had decrea&s;ed in a pretty exact pro|portion to our having &s;ecured the means of enjoying it.</P>
<P>That the antipodes to wrong are hardly ever right, was very &s;trikingly illu&s;trated a|bout the middle of the la&s;t century, when the
<PB N="11" REF="029103_0013_0FDF9B3FD55CA4A8">
fiery and indi&s;creet zeal of one party was made a pretext for the profligate impiety of the other; who, to the bad principle which dictated a depraved conduct, added the bad ta&s;te of being proud of it:&mdash;when even the lea&s;t abandoned were ab&s;urdly apprehen&s;ive that an appearance of decency might &s;ubject them to the charge of fanatici&s;m, a charge in which they took care to involve real piety as well as enthu&s;ia&s;tic pretence; till it became the general fa&s;hion to avoid no &s;in but hypo|cri&s;y, to dread no imputation but that of &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s, and to be more afraid of a good re|putation than of every vice which ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|ed a bad one.</P>
<P>It was not till piety was thus unfortunate|ly brought into di&s;repute, that per&s;ons of condition thought it made their &s;incerity, their abilities or their good breeding que&s;tionable, to appear openly on the &s;ide of religion. A &s;trict attachment of piety did not &s;ubject from a great reputation. Men were not thought the wor&s;e lawyers, generals, mini|&s;ters, legilators, or hi&s;torians, for believing, and even defending, the religion of their country. The gallant Sir Philip Sidney, the ra&s;h but heroic E&s;&s;ex, the politic and &s;a|gacious Burleigh, the all accompli&s;hed Falk|land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Falkland a&s;&s;i&s;ted the great Chillingworth in his incomparable work.

This indeed is the boa&s;ted period of free enquiry and liberty of thinking, and a noble &s;ubject of boa&s;ting it is.

Under the beautiful ma&s;k of an enlightened philo&s;ophy, all religious re&s;traints are &s;et at nought; and &s;ome of the deadlie&s;t wounds have been aimed at chri&s;tianity, in works written in avowed vindication of the mo&s;t amiable of all the chri&s;tian principles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See particularly <HI>Voltaire &s;ur la Tolerance.</HI> This is a common artifice of that engaging but in&s;idious author.

<P>Having wi&s;ely and happily freed our&s;elves from the trammels of human authority, are we not turning our liberty into licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and wantonly &s;truggling to throw off the <HI>di|vine</HI> authority too? Freedom of thought is the glory of the human mind, while it is confi|ned within its ju&s;t and &s;ober limits; but though we are accountable for <HI>opinions</HI> at no earthly tribunal, yet it &s;hould be remembered, that thoughts as well as actions are amenable to the bar of God: and though we may rejoice that
<PB N="15" REF="029103_0017_0FDF9B4698A524A0">
the tyranny of the &s;piritual Procru&s;tes is &s;o far annihilated, that it is no longer thought a proof of the orthodoxy of one man's opinions, that he lop or lengthen tho&s;e of another till they fit his own mea&s;ure; yet there is &s;till a &s;tandard by which not only actions are weigh|ed, but opinions are judged, and every &s;enti|ment which is clearly incon&s;i&s;tent with the revealed will of God, is as much throwing off <HI>his</HI> dominion, as the breach of any of his moral precepts.</P>
<P>There is then &s;urely one te&s;t by which it is no mark of intolerance to try the princi|ples of men, namely, the <HI>Law and the Te|&s;timony</HI>: and it is impo&s;&s;ible not to lament, that while a more generous &s;pirit governs our judgment, a purer principle does not &s;eem to regulate our lives. May it not be &s;aid, that while we are ju&s;tly commended for thinking charitably of the opinion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of others, we &s;eem, in return, as if we were de&s;irous of furni&s;h|ing them with an opportunity of exerci&s;ing their candour, by the laxity of principle in which we indulge our&s;elves? If the hearts of men are as firmly united to each other by the bond of charity, as &s;ome pretend, they could not fail of being united to God al&s;o, by one common principle of piety, the only certain &s;ource of all charitable judgment, as well as of all virtuous conduct.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of abiding by the &s;alutary precept of <HI>judging no man,</HI> it is the fa&s;hion to exceed our commi&s;&s;ion, and to fancy every body to

be in a &s;afe &s;tate. But, in forming our no|tions, we have to choo&s;e between the Bible and the world, between the rule and the practice. Where the&s;e do not agree, it is left to the judgment, of believers at lea&s;t, by which we are to decide. But we never act, in religious concerns, by the &s;ame rule of common-&s;en&s;e and equitable judgment which governs us on other occa&s;ions. In weighing any commodity, its weight is determined by &s;ome generally-allowed &s;tandard; and if the commodity be heavier or lighter than the &s;tand|ard weight, we add to or take from it: but we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> break, or clip, or reduce the weight to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the thing we are weighing; becau&s;e the common con&s;ent of mankind has agreed that the one &s;hall be con&s;idered as the &s;tandard to a&s;certain the value of the other. But, in weighing our principles by the &s;tandard of the Go&s;pel, we do ju&s;t the rever&s;e. In&s;tead of bringing our opinions and actions to the <HI>balance of the &s;anctuary,</HI> to determine and rec|tify their comparative deficiencies, we lower and reduce the &s;tandard of the &s;cripture doc|trines till we have accommodated them to our own purpo&s;es; &s;o that, in&s;tead of try|ing others and our&s;elves by God's unerring rule, we try the truth of God's rule by its conformity or nonconformity to our own de|praved notions and corrupt practices.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Benevolence allowed to be the reigning virtue, but not <HI>exclu&s;ively</HI> the virtue of the pre&s;ent age. Benevolence not the whole of religion, though one of its mo&s;t characteri&s;tic features. Whether benevolence proceed from a religious principle, will be more infallibly known by the general di&s;po&s;ition of time, fortune, and the common habits of life, than from a few occa|&s;ional acts of bounty.</HEAD>
<P>TO all the remon&s;trances and invectives of the preceding chapter, there will not fail to be oppo&s;ed that which we hear every day &s;o loudly in&s;i&s;ted on&mdash;the decided &s;uperiority of the pre&s;ent age, in other and better re|&s;pects. It will be &s;aid, that even tho&s;e who neglect the outward forms of religion, ex|hibit however the be&s;t proofs of the be&s;t prin|ciples; that the unparalleled in&s;tances of cha|rity, of which we are continual witne&s;&s;es; that the many &s;triking acts of public boun|ty, and the various new and noble improve|ments in this &s;hining virtue, ju&s;tly entitle the pre&s;ent age to be called, by way of emi|nence, <HI>the age of benevolence.</HI></P>
<P>It is with the livelie&s;t joy I acknow|ledge the delightful truth. Liberality flows with a full tide through a thou&s;and chan|nels.
<PB N="18" REF="029103_0020_0FDF9B1BDE482E98">
There is &s;carcely a new&s;paper but re|cords &s;ome meeting of men of fortune for the mo&s;t &s;alutary purpo&s;es. The noble and numberle&s;s &s;tructures for the relief of di&s;|tre&s;s, which are the ornament and the glory of our metropolis, proclaim a &s;pecies of mu|nificence unknown to former ages. Sub|&s;criptions, not only to ho&s;pitals, but to va|rious other valuable in&s;titutions, are obtained almo&s;t as &s;oon as &s;olicited. And who but mu&s;t with that the&s;e beautiful monuments of bene|volence may become every day more nume|rous, and more extended?</P>
<P>Yet with all the&s;e allowed and obvious ex|cellencies, it is not quite clear whether &s;ome|thing too much has not been &s;aid of the libe|rality of the pre&s;ent age, in a comparative view with that of tho&s;e ages which preceded it. A general alteration of habits and man|ners has at the &s;ame time multiplied public bounties and private di&s;tre&s;s; and it is &s;carce|ly a paradox to &s;ay, that there was probably le&s;s mi&s;ery when there was le&s;s munificence.</P>
<P>If an increa&s;ed benevolence now ranges through, and relieves a wider compa&s;s of di&s;|tre&s;s; yet &s;till if tho&s;e examples of luxury and di&s;&s;ipation which promote that di&s;tre&s;s, are &s;till <HI>more</HI> increa&s;ed, this makes the good done bear little proportion to the evil promoted. If the mi&s;eries removed by the growth of chari|ty fall, both in number and weight, far be|low tho&s;e which are cau&s;ed by the growth of vice and di&s;order; if we find, that though
<PB N="19" REF="029103_0021_0FDF9B4A03C96FC8">
bounty is extended, yet, that tho&s;e corrupti|ons which make bounty &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, are ex|tended, al&s;o, almo&s;t beyond calculation; if it appear that though more objects are reliev|ed by our money, yet incomparably more are debauched by our licentiou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;the balance perhaps will not turn out &s;o decidedly in favour of the times as we are willing to imagine.</P>
<P>If then the mo&s;t valuable &s;pecies of charity is that which prevents di&s;tre&s;s by preventing or le&s;&s;ening vice, the greate&s;t and mo&s;t inevi|table cau&s;e of want; we ought not &s;o highly to exalt the bounty of the great in the pre|&s;ent day, in preference to that broad &s;hade of protection, patronage, and maintenance, which the wide-&s;pread bounty of their fore|fathers &s;tretched out over whole villages, I had almo&s;t &s;aid whole provinces. When a few noblemen in a county, like a few of their own &s;tately oaks (paternal oaks! which are not often &s;et upon a card), extended their &s;heltering branches to &s;hield all the un|derwood of the fore&s;t&mdash;when there exi&s;ted a kind of pa&s;&s;ive charity, a negative &s;ort of be|nevolence, which did good of it&s;elf; and without effort, exertion, or expence, per|formed the be&s;t functions of bounty, though it did not a&s;pire to the dignity of its name&mdash; it was &s;imply this:&mdash;great people &s;taid at home; and the &s;ober pomp, and orderly magnificence of a noble family, re&s;iding at their own ca&s;tle great part of the year, con|tributed
<PB N="20" REF="029103_0022_0FDF9B1E113E17D0">
in the mo&s;t natural way to the main|tenance of the poor; and in a good degree prevented that di&s;tre&s;s, which it mu&s;t how|ever be thankfully confe&s;&s;ed it is the laudable object of modern bounty to relieve. A man of fortune might not then, it is true, &s;o often dine in public, for the benefit of the poor; but the poor were more regularly and com|fortably fed with the abundant crumbs which then fell from the rich man's table. Where|as it cannot be denied that the prevailing mode of living has pared real ho&s;pitality to the very quick: and, though the remark may be thought ridiculous, it is a material di&s;ad|vantage to the poor, that the introduction of the modern &s;tyle of luxury has rendered the remains of the mo&s;t co&s;tly table but of &s;mall value.</P>
<P>But even allowing the boa&s;ted &s;uperiority of modern benevolence, &s;till it will not be in|con&s;i&s;tent with the object of the pre&s;ent de|&s;ign, to enquire whether the diffu&s;ion of this branch of charity, though the mo&s;t lovely off|&s;pring of religion, be yet any po&s;itive proof of the prevalence of religious principles: and whether it is not the fa&s;hion rather to con&s;i|der benevolence as a &s;ub&s;titute for chri&s;tiani|ty, than as an evidence of it.</P>
<P>For it &s;eems to be one of the reigning er|rors among the better &s;ort, to reduce all reli|gion into benevolence, and all benevolence into alms-giving. The wide and comprehen|&s;ive idea of chri&s;tian charity is compre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="21" REF="029103_0023_0FDF9B514E8C51C8">
into the &s;lender compa&s;s of a little pecuniary relief. This &s;pecies of benevolence is indeed a bright gem among the ornaments of a chri&s;|tian; but by no means furni&s;hes all the jew|els of his crown, which derives its lu&s;tre from the a&s;&s;ociated radiance of every chri&s;tian grace. Be&s;ides, the genuine virtues are all of the &s;ame family; and it is only by being &s;een in company with each other, and with Piety their common parent, that they are certainly known to be legitimate, for there are &s;uch things as even &s;purious virtues.</P>
<P>But is this the property of the <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> virtues, that, like all other amiable members of the &s;ame family, while each is doing its own particular duty, it is contributing to the pro&s;perity of the re&s;t; and the larger the fa|mily the better they live together, as no one can advance it&s;elf without labouring for the advancement of the whole: thus, no man can be benevolent on chri&s;tian principles, with|out &s;elf-denial; and &s;o of the other virtues: each is connected with &s;ome other, and all with religion.</P>
<P>I already anticipate the obvious and hack|neyed reply, that "whoever be the in&s;tru|ment, and whatever be the motive of bounty, &s;till the poor are equally relieved, and there|fore the end is the &s;ame." And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that tho&s;e compa&s;&s;ionate hearts, who cannot but be earne&s;tly anxious that the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;hould be relieved at any rate, &s;hould not too &s;crupulou&s;ly enquire into any
<PB N="22" REF="029103_0024_0FDF9B222FF33138">
cau&s;e of which the effect is &s;o beneficial. Nor indeed will candour &s;crutinize too curiou&s;ly into the errors of any life, of which benevo|lence will always be allowed to be a &s;hining ornament, while it does not pretend to be an atoning virtue.</P>
<P>Let me not be mi&s;repre&s;ented, as if I were &s;eeking to detract from the value of this ami|able feeling; one does not &s;urely lower the practice by &s;eeking to ennoble the principle; the action will not be impaired by mending the motive: and no one will be likely to give the poor le&s;s, becau&s;e he &s;eeks to plea&s;e God more.</P>
<P>One cannot then help wi&s;hing that pecuni|ary bounty were not only practi&s;ed, but &s;ome|times enjoined too, as a redeeming virtue. In many conver&s;ations, I had almo&s;t &s;aid in many charity &s;ermons, it is in&s;inuated as if a little alms-giving could pay off old &s;cores contracted by favourite indulgences. This, though often done by well-meaning men to advance the intere&s;ts of &s;ome pre&s;ent pious purpo&s;e, yet has the mi&s;chievous effect of tho&s;e medicines which while they may re|lieve a local complaint, are yet undermining the general habit.</P>
<P>That great numbers who are not influen|ced by &s;o high a principle as chri&s;tianity holds out, are yet truly compa&s;&s;ionate, with|out hypocri&s;y, and without o&s;tentation, who can doubt? &s;ince there are by nature many tender hearts; for did not God make them?
<PB N="23" REF="029103_0025_0FDF9B535A8D3208">
and is he not the Author of all that is good in nature, as well as in grace?</P>
<P>But who that feels the beauty of benevo|lence, can avoid being &s;olicitous, not only that its offerings &s;hould comfort the receiver, but return in ble&s;&s;ings to the bo&s;om of the giver, by &s;pringing from &s;uch motives, and being accompanied by &s;uch a temper as &s;hall redound to his eternal good? For that the benefit is the &s;ame to the object, whatever be the character of the benefactor, is but an un|comfortable view of things to a real chri&s;tian, who&s;e compa&s;&s;ion reaches to the &s;ouls of men. Such an one longs to &s;ee the charitable giver as happy as he is endeavouring to make the object of his bounty; but &s;uch an one knows that no happine&s;s can be fully and finally en|joyed but on the &s;olid ba&s;is of chri&s;tian piety.</P>
<P>For as religion is not, on the one hand, merely an opinion or a &s;entiment; &s;o neither is it, on the other, merely an act or a per|formance, but it is a di&s;po&s;ition, a habit, a temper: it is not a name, but a nature: it is a turning the whole mind to God; a con|centration of all the powers and affections of the &s;oul into one &s;teady point, an uniform de|&s;ire to plea&s;e <HI>Him.</HI> This de&s;ire will naturally and nece&s;&s;arily manife&s;t it&s;elf, in our doing all the good we can to our fellow-creatures in every po&s;&s;ible way; for it will be found that neither of the two parts into which practical religion is divided, can be performed with any degree of perfection but by tho&s;e who
<PB N="24" REF="029103_0026_0FDF9B250655CBB0">
unite both: as it may be que&s;tioned if any man really <HI>does</HI> "love his neighbour as him&s;elf," who does not fir&s;t endeavour to "love God with all his heart." As genius has been de|fined to be &s;trong general powers of mind ac|cidentally determined to &s;ome particular pur|&s;uit; &s;o piety may be denominated a &s;trong general di&s;po&s;ition of the heart to every thing that is right, breaking forth into every excel|lent action, as the occa&s;ion pre&s;ents it&s;elf. The temper mu&s;t be ready in the mind, and the whole heart mu&s;t be prepared and train|ed to every act of virtue to which it may be called out. For religious principles are like the military exerci&s;e; they keep up an habi|tual &s;tate of preparation for actual &s;ervice; and by never relaxing the di&s;cipline, the real chri&s;tian is ready for every duty to which he may be commanded. Right actions be&s;t prove the exi&s;tence of religion in the heart; but they are evidences, not cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Whether therefore a man's charitable ac|tions proceed from religious principle, he will be be&s;t able to a&s;certain by &s;crutinizing into what is the general di&s;po&s;ition of his time and fortune; and by attending to &s;uch an habitual regulation of his plea&s;ures and expences as will enable him to be more or le&s;s u&s;eful to others.</P>
<P>For it is in vain that he may po&s;&s;e&s;s, what is called by the courte&s;y of fa&s;hion <HI>the be&s;t heart in the world</HI> (a character we every day hear applied to the libertine and the prodi|gal),
<PB N="25" REF="029103_0027_0FDF9B550E1FD840">
if he &s;quander his time and e&s;tate in &s;uch a round of extravagant indulgences, and thoughtle&s;s di&s;&s;ipation, as leaves him little money and le&s;s lei&s;ure for nobler purpo&s;es. It makes but little difference whether a man is prevented from doing good by hard-heart|ed par&s;imony or an unprincipled extrava|gance; the &s;tream is equally cut off.</P>
<P>The mere <HI>ca&s;ual</HI> benevolence of any man can have little claim to &s;olid e&s;teem; nor does any charity de&s;erve the name which does not grow out of a &s;teady conviction that it is his bounden duty, which does not &s;pring from a &s;ettled propen&s;ity to obey the whole will of God; which is not therefore made a part of the general plan of his conduct; and which does not lead him to order the whole &s;cheme of his affairs with an eye to it.</P>
<P>He therefore who does not habituate him|&s;elf to certain interior re&s;traints, who does not live in a regular cour&s;e of &s;elf-renuncia|tion, will not be likely often to perform acts of beneficence, when it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to convert to &s;uch purpo&s;es any of that time or money which appetite, temptation or vanity &s;olicit him to divert to other purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>And &s;urely he who &s;eldom &s;acrifices one darling indulgence, who does not &s;ubtract one gratification from the ince&s;&s;ant round of his enjoyments, when the indulgence would ob&s;truct his capacity of doing good, or when the &s;acrifice would enlarge his power, does not de&s;erve the name of benevolent. And
<PB N="26" REF="029103_0028_0FDF9B26B5771E58">
for &s;uch an unequivocal criterion of charity to whom are we to look, but to the con&s;cien|tious chri&s;tian? No other &s;pirit but that by which he is governed, can &s;ubdue &s;elf-love: and where &s;elf-love is the predominant pa&s;|&s;ion, benevolence can have but a feeble, or an accidental dominion.</P>
<P>Now if we look around and remark the ex|ce&s;&s;es of luxury, the co&s;tly diver&s;ions, and the intemperate di&s;&s;ipation in which numbers of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians indulge them&s;elves, can any &s;tretch of candour, can even that tender &s;entiment by which we are enjoined "to hope" and to "believe all things," enable us to hope and believe that &s;uch are actuated by a &s;pirit of chri&s;tian benevolence, merely becau&s;e we &s;ee them perform &s;ome ca&s;ual acts of charity, which the &s;pirit of the world can contrive to make extremely com|patible with a voluptuous life, and the co&s;t of which, after all, bears but little proportion to that of any one vice, or even vanity?</P>
<P>Men will not believe that there is hardly a|ny one human good quality which will know and keep its proper bounds, without the re|&s;training influence of religious principle. There is, for in&s;tance, great danger le&s;t a con&s;tant attention to &s;o right a practice as an invariable oeconomy &s;hould incline the heart to the love of money. Nothing can effectu|ally counteract this natural propen&s;ity, but the chri&s;tian habit of devoting tho&s;e retrench|ed expences to &s;ome good purpo&s;e; and then
<PB N="27" REF="029103_0029_0FDF9B5759A31088">
oeconomy, in&s;tead of narrowing the heart, will enlarge it, by inducing a con&s;tant a&s;&s;o|ciation of benevolence with frugality. An habitual attention to the wants of others, is the only whole&s;ome regulator of our own ex|pences, and carries with it a whole train of virtues, di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, &s;obriety, and tem|perance. And tho&s;e who live in the cu&s;tom of levying con&s;tant taxes on their vanities for &s;uch purpo&s;es, &s;erve the poor &s;till le&s;s than they &s;erve them&s;elves, by cultivating &s;uch ha|bits as make the be&s;t qualification for their final happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus when a vein of chri&s;tianity runs through the whole ma&s;s of a man's life, it gives a new value to all his actions, and a new character to all his views. It tran&s;mutes prudence and oeconomy into chri&s;tian vir|tues; and every offering that is pre&s;ented on the altar of charity, becomes truly con&s;ecrat|ed, when it is the gift of obedience, and the price of &s;elf-denial. Piety is the fire from heaven, which can alone kindle the &s;acrifice, and make it acceptable.</P>
<P>On the other hand, when any act of boun|ty is performed by way of compo&s;ition with one's Maker, either as a purcha&s;e, or an ex|piation of unallowed indulgences; though even in this ca&s;e, God, (who makes all the pa&s;&s;ions of men &s;ub&s;ervient to his good pur|po&s;es) can make the gift equally beneficial to the receiver; yet it is &s;urely not too &s;evere to &s;ay, that to the giver &s;uch acts are an un|founded dependance, a deceitful refuge, a broken staff.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. The neglect of religious education both a cau&s;e and con&s;equence of the decline of chri&s;tianity. No moral re&s;traints&mdash;Religion only inciden|tally taught, not as a principle of action. A few of the cau&s;es which di&s;po&s;e the young to entertain low opinions of religion.</HEAD>
<P>LET not the truly &s;erious be offended, as if, in the pre&s;ent chapter, which is intend|ed to treat of the notorious neglect of reli|gious education, I meant to confine the &s;pi|rit of chri&s;tianity to merely mechanical ef|fects, and to &s;uppo&s;e that piety mu&s;t be the natural and inevitable con&s;equence of early in&s;titution. To imply this, would be indeed to betray a lamentable ignorance of human nature, of the di&s;order &s;in has introduced, of the inefficacy of human means, and entirely to mi&s;take the genius of our religion. It would be to &s;uppo&s;e that God was to depend upon <HI>our</HI> goodne&s;s, and not upon <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P>Yet it mu&s;t be allowed that the Supreme Being works chiefly by means; and though it is confe&s;&s;ed that no defect of education, no corruption of manners, can place any one out of the reach of the divine influences (for it is under &s;uch circum&s;tances, perhaps, that the mo&s;t extraordinary in&s;tances of divine grace have been manife&s;ted); yet it mu&s;t be
<PB N="29" REF="029103_0031_0FDF9B5CDB716018">
owned, that early &s;obriety, early knowledge of religion, and early habits of piety, are the mo&s;t probable means of &s;ecuring the favour of God. To acquire the&s;e, is putting our|&s;elves in the way in which he him&s;elf has told us his ble&s;&s;ing is to be found.</P>
<P>But religion is the only thing in which we &s;eem to look for the end, without making u&s;e of the means: and yet, it would not be more &s;urpri&s;ing if we were to expect that our children &s;hould become arti&s;ts and &s;cholars, without being bred to arts and languages, than it is to look for a chri&s;tian world, with|out a chri&s;tian education.</P>
<P>The noble&s;t objects can yield no delight, if there be not in the mind a di&s;po&s;ition to en|joy them, ari&s;ing from an intelligence of their nature, and a reverence for their value, which can only &s;pring from long habit and early acquaintance. For to produce any capacity of enjoyment, there mu&s;t be a congruity be|tween the mind and the object. To the ma|thematician demon&s;tration is plea&s;ure; to the philo&s;opher the &s;tudy of nature; to the vo|luptuous the gratification of his appetite; to the poet the plea&s;ures of his imagination. The&s;e objects they all re&s;pectively pur&s;ue as their proper bu&s;ine&s;s, as plea&s;ures adapted to that part of their nature which they have been accu&s;tomed to indulge and cultivate.</P>
<P>Now, as men will be apt to act con&s;i&s;tently with their general views and habitual tenden|cies, would it not be ab&s;urd to expect that
<PB N="30" REF="029103_0032_0FDF9B2CCEAAAF38">
the philo&s;opher &s;hould look for his &s;overeign good at a ball, or the &s;en&s;uali&s;t in the plea&s;ures of intellect or piety? None of the&s;e ends are an&s;werable to the general views of the re&s;pec|tive pur&s;uer; they are not corre&s;ponding to his ideas; they are not commen&s;urate to his aims. The &s;ublime&s;t plea&s;ures can afford lit|tle gratification where a previous ta&s;te has not been cultivated. A clown, who &s;hould hear a &s;cholar or an arti&s;t talk of the delights of a library, a picture gallery, or a concert, could not gue&s;s at the nature of the plea&s;ures they afford, nor would his being introduced to them give him much clearer ideas, becau&s;e he would bring to them an eye blind to pro|portion, an under&s;tanding new to &s;cience, and an ear deaf to harmony.</P>
<P>Shall we expect then, &s;ince men can only be &s;cholars by &s;edulous labour, that they &s;hall be chri&s;tians by mere chance? Shall we be &s;urpri&s;ed if tho&s;e do not fulfil the offices of religion, who are not trained to an acquain|tance with them? And will it not be obvious, that it mu&s;t be &s;ome other thing be&s;ides the ab&s;tru&s;ene&s;s of creeds and opinions, which makes chri&s;tianity unfa&s;hionable?</P>
<P>For it will not probably be di&s;puted, that in no age have the pa&s;&s;ions of youth been &s;o early freed from the <HI>muzzle of re&s;traint</HI>; in no age has the paternal authority been &s;o contemptuou&s;ly treated, or every &s;pecies of &s;ubordination &s;o di&s;dainfully trampled on.

&s;eem to be melting into each other. In no age has imprudent fondne&s;s been &s;o injuriou&s;ly lavi&s;h, or the &s;upernumerary expen&s;es of the college and the &s;chool (that prolific &s;eed of corruption) been &s;o prodigally augmented. In no age have the appetites been excited by &s;uch early &s;timulants, and anticipated by &s;uch premature indulgences. Never was the &s;hining glo&s;s, the charming novelty of life &s;o early worn off from the enjoyment by ex|ce&s;&s;ive u&s;e. Never had &s;imple, and natural, and youthful plea&s;ures &s;o early lo&s;t their power over the mind; nor was ever one great &s;ecret of virtue and happine&s;s the &s;e|cret of being cheaply plea&s;ed, &s;o little under|&s;tood.</P>
<P>A ta&s;te for co&s;tly, or artificial, or tumultu|ous plea&s;ures cannot be gratified, by their mo&s;t &s;edulous pur&s;uers, at every moment; and what wretched management is it in the oeconomy of human happine&s;s &s;o to contrive, as that the enjoyment &s;hall be rare and dif|ficult, and the intervals long and languid! Whereas real and unadulterated plea&s;ures oc|cur perpetually to him who cultivates a ta&s;te for truth and nature, and &s;cience and virtue. But the&s;e &s;imple and tranquil enjoyments cannot but be in&s;ipid to him, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions have been prematurely excited by agitating plea&s;ures, or who&s;e ta&s;te has been depraved by &s;uch as are deba&s;ing and frivolous; for it is of more con&s;equence to virtue than &s;ome good people are willing to allow, to pre&s;erve
<PB N="32" REF="029103_0034_0FDF9B2F8A1AE230">
the ta&s;te pure, and the judgment &s;ound. A vitiated intellect has no &s;mall connection with depraved morals.</P>
<P>Since amu&s;ements of &s;ome kind are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to all ages (I &s;peak now with an eye to mere human enjoyment), why &s;hould it not be as proper to tether men as other ani|mals? Why &s;hould not he too be confined, in different &s;tages of life, to certain re&s;tricted limitations? &s;ince nothing but experience &s;eems to teach him, that if he be allowed to anticipate his future po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and trample all the flowery fields of real, as well as ima|ginary and artificial enjoyment, he not only induces pre&s;ent di&s;gu&s;t, but defaces and de|&s;troys all the rich materials of his future hap|pine&s;; and leaves him&s;elf, for the re&s;t of his life, nothing but ravaged fields and bar|ren &s;tubble.</P>
<P>But the great and radical defect, and that which comes more immediately within the pre&s;ent de&s;ign, &s;eems to be, that in general the characteri&s;tical principles of chri&s;tianity are not early and &s;trongly infu&s;ed into the mind: that religion is rather taught inci|dentally, as a thing of &s;ubordinate value, than as the leading principle of human acti|ons, and the great animating &s;pring of hu|man conduct. Were the high influential principles of the chri&s;tian religion anxiou&s;ly and early inculcated, we &s;hould find that tho&s;e lap&s;es from virtue, to which pa&s;&s;ion and
<PB N="33" REF="029103_0035_0FDF9B60F5C1B030">
temptation afterwards too frequently &s;olicit, would be more ea&s;ily recoverable.</P>
<P>For though the evil propen&s;ities of fallen nature, and the bewitching allurements of plea&s;ure, will too often &s;educe even tho&s;e of the be&s;t education into devious paths, yet we &s;hall find that men will &s;eldom be <HI>incurably</HI> wicked, without that internal corruption of principle, which knows how to ju&s;tify iniqui|ty, and confirm evil conduct, by the &s;ancti|on of corrupt rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>The errors occa&s;ioned by the violence of pa&s;|&s;ion may be reformed, but &s;y&s;tematic wick|edne&s;s will be only fortified by time; and no decrea&s;e of &s;trength, no decay of appetite, can weaken the power of a pernicious princi|ple. He who commits a wrong action in|deed, puts him&s;elf out of the path of &s;afety; but he who adopts a fal&s;e principle, not only throws him&s;elf into the enemy's country, but burns the &s;hips, breaks the bridge, cuts off every retreat by which he might hope one day to return into his own.</P>
<P>Surely it will &s;ubject no one to the im|putation of bigotry or enthu&s;ia&s;m, if he ven|ture to enquire whether the genuine doc|trines of chri&s;tianity are made the &s;tandard by which our young men of fa&s;hion are com|monly taught to try their principles, or to weigh their actions; or whether &s;ome more popular &s;tandard, of cu&s;tom, or fa&s;hion, or worldly opinion, be not too frequently allowed to &s;uper&s;ede them? Whether &s;ome idol of
<PB N="34" REF="029103_0036_0FDF9B314318DCA8">
fal&s;e honour be not con&s;ecrated for them to wor&s;hip? Whether even among the better &s;ort, reputation be not held out as a motive of &s;ufficient energy to produce virtue, in a world where yet the greate&s;t vices are every day practi&s;ed openly, which do not at all ob|&s;truct the reception of tho&s;e who practi&s;e them into the be&s;t company? Whether re&s;entment be not ennobled, and pride, and many other pa&s;&s;ions, erected into honourable virtues&mdash;vir|tues not le&s;s repugnant to the genius and &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity, than obvious gro&s;s vi|ces? Will it be thought impertinent to en|quire if the awful doctrines of a perpetual|ly pre&s;ent Deity, and a future righteous judgment, are early impre&s;&s;ed, and la&s;tingly engraven, on the hearts and con&s;ciences of our high-born youth?</P>
<P>Perhaps, if there be any one particular in which we fall remarkably below the politer na|tions of antiquity, it is in that part of educa|tion which has a reference to purity of mind and the di&s;cipline of the heart.</P>
<P>For the great &s;ecret of religious education, and which &s;eems bani&s;hed from the pre&s;ent practi&s;e, con&s;i&s;ts in training young men to an habitual interior re&s;traint, an early goverment of the affections, and a cour&s;e of &s;elf-controul over tho&s;e tyrannizing inclinations, which have &s;o natural a tendency to en&s;lave the hu|man heart. Without this habit of moral re|&s;traint, which is one of the fundamental laws of chri&s;tian virtue, though men may, from na|tural

For the be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions will be ea&s;i|ly overcome by the concurrence of pa&s;&s;ion and temptation, in a heart where the pa&s;&s;ions have not been accu&s;tomed to this whole&s;ome di&s;cipline: and the mo&s;t amiable qualities will but more ea&s;ily betray their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, unle&s;s the yielding heart be fortified by repeated acts, and long habits, of re&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>In this, as in various other in&s;tances, we may blu&s;h at the &s;uperiority of Pagan in&s;titu|tion. Were the Roman youth taught to ima|gine them&s;elves always in the awful pre&s;ence of Cato, in order to habituate them betimes to &s;uppre&s;s ba&s;e &s;entiments, and to excite &s;uch as were generous and noble? And &s;hould not the chri&s;tian youth be continually reminded, that a greater than Cato is here? Should they not be trained to the habit of acting un|der the con&s;tant impre&s;&s;ion, that <HI>He</HI> to whom they mu&s;t one day be accountable for intenti|ons, as well as words and actions, is witne&s;s to the one as well as the other; that he not only is "about their paths," but "under|&s;tands their very thoughts?"</P>
<P>Were the di&s;ciples of a Pagan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pythagoras.</NOTE> leader taught that it was a motive &s;ufficient to compel their
<PB N="36" REF="029103_0038_0FDF9B684A54DDF0">
obedience to any rule, whether they liked it or not, that it had the authority of their teach|er's name? were the bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> words, <HI>the ma&s;ter hath &s;aid it,</HI> &s;ufficient to &s;ettle all di&s;putes, and to &s;ubdue all reluctance? And &s;hall the &s;cho|lars of a more divine teacher, who have a code of laws written by God him&s;elf, be con|tented with a lower rule, or abide by a mean|er authority? And is any argument drawn from human con&s;iderations likely to operate more forcibly on a dependant being, than that &s;imple but grand a&s;&s;ertion, with which &s;o many of the precepts of our religion are in|troduced&mdash;Becau&s;e, THUS SAITH THE LORD?</P>
<P>For it is doing but little, in the infu&s;ion of fir&s;t principles, to obtain the bare a&s;&s;ent of the under&s;tanding to the exi&s;tence of one Su|preme Power, unle&s;s the heart and affections go along with the conviction, by our conceiv|ing of that power as intimately connected with our&s;elves. A feeling temper will be but little affected with the cold idea of a <HI>geometrical</HI> God, as the excellent Pa&s;cal expre&s;&s;es it, who mere|ly adju&s;ts all the parts of matter, and keeps the elements in order. Such a mind will be but little moved, unle&s;s he be taught to con|&s;ider his Maker under the intere&s;ting and en|dearing repre&s;entation which revealed religi|on gives of him. That "God is," will be to him rather an alarming than a con&s;olatory idea; till he be per&s;uaded of the &s;ub&s;equent propo&s;ition, that "he is the rewarder of all &s;uch as diligently &s;eek him." Nay if natu|ral
<PB N="37" REF="029103_0039_0FDF9BB16B195B10">
religion does even acknowledge one, aw|ful attribute, that "God is ju&s;t;" it will on|ly increa&s;e the terror of a tender con&s;cience, till he learn, from the fountain of truth, that he is, "the ju&s;tifier of all who believe on him."</P>
<P>But if the great &s;anctions of our religion are not deeply engraven on the heart, where &s;hall we look for a more adequate curb to the fiery &s;pirit of youth? For, let the elements be ever &s;o kindly mixed in human compo&s;i|tion, let the natural temper be ever &s;o ami|able, &s;till whenever a man cea&s;es to think him|&s;elf an accountable being, what motive can he have for re&s;i&s;ting a &s;trong temptation to a pre&s;ent good, when he has no dread that he &s;hall thereby forfeit a greater future good?</P>
<P>But it will be objected, that this deep &s;en&s;e of religion would interfere with the general purpo&s;es of education, which is de&s;igned to qualify men for the bu&s;ine&s;s of human life, and not to train up a race of monks and a&s;ceties.</P>
<P>There is however &s;o little real &s;olidity in this &s;pecious objection, that I am firmly per|&s;uaded, that if religious principles were more deeply impre&s;&s;ed on the heart, even the things of this world would be much bet|ter carried on. For where are we to look for &s;o much punctuality, diligence, application, doing every thing in its proper day (the great hinge on which bu&s;ine&s;s turns), as among men of principle? Oeconomy of time,
<PB N="38" REF="029103_0040_0FDF9B6A5580C2C0">
truth in ob&s;erving his word, never daring to deceive or to di&s;appoint&mdash;the&s;e are the very e&s;&s;ence of a man of bu&s;ine&s;s; and for the&s;e to whom &s;hall we mo&s;t naturally look? Who is &s;o little likely to be "&s;lothful in bu&s;ine&s;s," as he who is "fervent in &s;pirit?" Will not he be mo&s;t regular in dealing with men, who is mo&s;t diligent in "&s;erving the Lord?"</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, allowing that religion does not nece&s;&s;arily &s;poil a man of <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> yet it would effectually defeat tho&s;e accom|pli&s;hments, and counteract that fine breeding, which e&s;&s;entially con&s;titute the <HI>gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>This again is &s;o far from being a natural con&s;equence, that, &s;uppo&s;ing all the other real advantages, of parts and education, to be equally taken into the account, there is no doubt but that, in point of true polite|ne&s;s, a real chri&s;tian would beat the world at its own weapons, the world it&s;elf being judge.</P>
<P>For though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, other wickedne&s;s has made di&s;&s;imulation nece&s;&s;ary; and that being the ca&s;e, there is &s;carcely any one in|vention for which we are more obliged to mankind than for that of politene&s;s, as there is perhaps no &s;creen in the world which hides &s;o many ugly &s;ights: yet while we allow that there never was &s;o admirable a &s;upplement to real goodne&s;s, as good breeding; it is however certain that the principles of chri&s;|tianity put into action, would nece&s;&s;arily pro|duce
<PB N="39" REF="029103_0041_0FDF9BB32370B160">
more genuine politene&s;s than any max|ims drawn from motives of human vanity or convenience. If <HI>love, peace, joy, long-&s;uffer|ing, gentlene&s;s, patience, goodne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>meek|ne&s;s,</HI> may be thought in&s;truments to produce &s;weetne&s;s of manners, the&s;e we are expre&s;sly told are "the fruits of the &s;pirit." If mourning with the afflicted, rejoicing with the happy, if "to e&s;teem others better than our&s;elves;" if "to take the lowe&s;t room;" if "not to &s;eek our own;" if "not to be|have our&s;elves un&s;eemly;" if "not to &s;peak great &s;welling words of vanity"&mdash;if the&s;e are amiable, engaging and polite parts of beha|viour; then would the documents of Saint Paul make as true a fine gentleman as the <HI>Courtier of Ca&s;tiglione,</HI> or even the <HI>Letters of Lord Che&s;terfield</HI> him&s;elf. Then would &s;i|mulation, and di&s;&s;imulation, and all the nice &s;hades and delicate gradations of pa&s;&s;ive and ac|tive deceit, be rendered &s;uperfluous; and the affections of every heart be won by a &s;horter and a &s;urer way, than by the elegant obliquities of this late popular preceptor; who&s;e mi&s;chiefs have outlived his reputation; and who, not|with&s;tanding the pre&s;ent ju&s;t declen&s;ion of his fame, has helped to relax the general nerve of virtue, and has left a taint upon the public morals, of which we are &s;till &s;en&s;i|ble.</P>
<P>That &s;elf-aba&s;ement then, which is in&s;e|parable from chri&s;tianity, and the external &s;igns of which good breeding knows &s;o well
<PB N="40" REF="029103_0042_0FDF9B6C88C84A80">
how to a&s;&s;ume; and tho&s;e charities which &s;ugge&s;t invariable kindne&s;s to others, even in the &s;malle&s;t things, would, if left to their natural workings, produce that gentlene&s;s which it is one great object of a polite education to imitate. They would produce it too without effort and without exertion; for being inherent in the &s;ub&s;tance, it would naturally produce it&s;elf on the &s;urface.</P>
<P>For however u&s;eful the in&s;titutions of po|li&s;hed &s;ociety may be found, yet they can ne|ver alter the eternal difference between right and wrong; or convert appearances into re|alities; they cannot transform decency into virtue nor make politene&s;s pa&s;s for principle. And the advocates for fa&s;hionable breeding, &s;hould be humbled to reflect, that every con|vention of artificial manners was invented not to <HI>cure,</HI> but to <HI>conceal,</HI> deformity: that though the &s;uperficial civilities of elegant life, tend to make this corrupt world a more tolerable place than it would be without them; yet they never will be con&s;idered as a &s;ub&s;titute for truth and virtue by HIM who is to pa&s;s the definitive &s;entence on the charracters of men.</P>
<P>Among the many prejudices which the young and the gay entertain again&s;t religion, one is, that it is the declared enemy to wit and ge|nius. But, &s;ays one of its wittie&s;t champions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. South</NOTE>, "Piety enjoins no man to be dull:" and it
<PB N="41" REF="029103_0043_0FDF9BB55B172A58">
will be found, on a fair enquiry, that though it cannot be denied that irreligion has had able men for its advocates, yet they have never been the mo&s;t able. Nor can any learned pro|fe&s;&s;ion, any department in letters or in &s;cience, produce a champion on the &s;ide of unbelief but chri&s;tianity has &s;till a greater name to op|po&s;e it; philo&s;ophers them&s;elves being judges.</P>
<P>But while the young adopt an opinion, from one cla&s;s of writers, that religious men are weak; they acquire, from another, a notion that they are ridiculous: and this opini|on, by mixing it&s;elf with their common no|tions, and deriving it&s;elf from their very amu&s;ements, is the more mi&s;chievous as it is received without re&s;i&s;tance or &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>One common medium through which they take this fal&s;e view is, tho&s;e favourite works of wit and humour, &s;o captivating to youthful imaginations, were no &s;mall part of the au|thor's &s;ucce&s;s perhaps has been owing to his dexterou&s;ly introducing a pious character, with &s;o many virtues, that it is impo&s;&s;ible not to love him, yet tinctured with &s;o ma|ny ab&s;urdities, that it is impo&s;&s;ible not to laugh at him. The reader's memory will furni&s;h him with too many in&s;tances of what is here meant. The &s;lighte&s;t touches of a witty malice can make the be&s;t character ridiculous. It is effected by any little auk|wardne&s;s, ab&s;ence of mind, an ob&s;olete phra&s;e, a formal pronunciation, a peculiarity of ge&s;ture. Or if &s;uch a character be brought,
<PB N="42" REF="029103_0044_0FDF9B6E38CA6038">
by un&s;u&s;pecting goodne&s;s, and tru&s;ting hone&s;|ty, into &s;ome fooli&s;h &s;crape, it will &s;tamp an impre&s;&s;ion of ridicule &s;o indelible, that all his worth &s;hall not be able to efface it: and the young who do not always &s;eparate their ideas very carefully, &s;hall ever after, by this early and fal&s;e a&s;&s;ociation, conceive of piety as having &s;omething e&s;&s;entially ridiculous in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But one of the mo&s;t infallible arts, by which the inexperienced are engaged on the &s;ide of irreligion, is, that popular air of candour, good nature, and toleration, which it &s;o in|invariably puts on. While, on the one hand, &s;incere piety is often accu&s;ed of moro&s;ene&s;s and &s;everity, becau&s;e it cannot hear the doc|trines, on which it founds its eternal hopes, derided without emotion; indifference or unbelief, on the other hand, purcha&s;e the prai&s;e of candour at an ea&s;y price, becau&s;e they neither &s;uffer grief, nor expre&s;s indignation, at hear|ing the mo&s;t awful truths ridiculed, or the mo&s;t &s;olemn obligations &s;et at nought.</P>
<P>The &s;coffers whom young people hear talk, and the books they hear quoted, fal&s;ely charge their own injurious opinions on chri|&s;tianity, and then unju&s;tly accu&s;e her of be|ing the mon&s;ter they have made. They dre&s;s her up, with the &s;word of per&s;ecution in one hand, and the flames of intolerance in the other; and then ridicule the &s;ober-minded for wor&s;hipping an idol which their mi&s;repre&s;entation has rendered as malignant as Moloch. In the mean time they affect
<PB N="43" REF="029103_0045_0FDF9BBA77CF5E68">
to &s;eize on benevolence with exclu&s;ive appro|priation as their own cardinal virtue, and to accu&s;e of a bigotted cruelty, that narrow &s;pirit which points out the perils of licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s, and the terrors of a future account. And yet this benevolence, with all its tender mercies, is not afraid nor a&s;hamed to endea|vour at &s;natching away from humble piety, the comfort of a pre&s;ent hope, and the bright pro&s;pect of a felicity that &s;hall have no end. It does not however &s;eem a very probable means of adding to the &s;tock of human hap|pine&s;s, by plundering mankind of that prin|ciple, by the de&s;truction of which friend&s;hip is robbed of its bond, &s;ociety of its &s;ecurity, pa|tience of its motive, morality of its foundation, integrity of its reward, &s;orrow of its con&s;olati|on, life of its balm, and death of its &s;upport.</P>
<P>It will not perhaps be one of the meane&s;t advantages of a better &s;tate, that as the will &s;hall be reformed, &s;o the judgment &s;hall be rectified; that "evil &s;hall no more be called good," nor the "churl liberal;" nor the plunderer of our be&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, our principles, benevolent. Then it will be evident that greater violence could not be done to truth and language, than to wre&s;t benevolence from chri&s;tianity, her mo&s;t appropriate and peculi|ar attribute. If benevolence be "good-will to men," it was that which angelic me&s;&s;en|gers were not thought too high to announce, nor a much higher being than angels to teach by his precepts, and to illu&s;trate by his death:
<PB N="44" REF="029103_0046_0FDF9B7309CA5518">
it was the criterion, the very watch-word as it were, by which he intended his religi|on and his followers &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed.

Be|&s;ides, it is the very genius of chri&s;tianity to extirpate all &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, on who&s;e vacated ground, benevolence naturally and nece&s;&s;a|rily plants it&s;elf.</P>
<P>But not to run through all the particulars which ob&s;truct the growth of piety in young per&s;ons, I &s;hall only name one more. They hear much declamation from the fa&s;hionable rea&s;oners, again&s;t the contracted and &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity&mdash;that it is of a &s;ordid temper, works for pay, and looks for re|ward.</P>
<P>But this jargon of French philo&s;ophy, which prates of pure di&s;intere&s;ted goodne&s;s acting for its own &s;ake, and equally de&s;pi|&s;ing puni&s;hment and di&s;daining recompence, indicates as little knowledge of human na|ture as of chri&s;tian revelation, when it ad|dre&s;&s;es man as a being made up of pure intel|lect, without any mixture of pa&s;&s;ions, and who can be made happy without hope, and virtuous without fear.</P>

<P>On calm and temperate &s;pirits, indeed, in the hour of retirement, in the repo&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ions, in the ab&s;ence of temptation, virtue does &s;eem to be her own adequate reward; and very lovely are the fruits &s;he bears, in pre|&s;erving health, credit, and fortune. But on how few will this principle act! and even on them, how often will its operation be &s;u&s;pend|ed! and though virtue for her own &s;ake, might have captivated often hearts, which almo&s;t &s;eem ca&s;t in a natural mould of good|ne&s;s; yet no motive could, at all times, be &s;o likely to re&s;train even the&s;e, under the pre&s;&s;ure of temptation, as this &s;imple a&s;&s;ertion &mdash;<HI>For all this God will bring me into judg|ment.</HI></P>
<P>But it is the beauty of our religion, that it is not held out exclu&s;ively to a few &s;elect &s;pirits; that it is not an object of &s;peculation or an exerci&s;e of ingenuity, but a <HI>rule of life,</HI> &s;uited to every condition, capacity, and temper.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Other &s;ymptoms of the decline of chri&s;tianity&mdash; No family religion&mdash;Corrupt or negligent ex|amples of &s;uperiors&mdash;The &s;elf-denying and evangelical virtues held in contempt&mdash;Neglect of encouraging and promoting religion among &s;ervants.</HEAD>
<P>IT was by no means the de&s;ign of the pre|&s;ent undertaking to make a general invec|tive on the corrupt &s;tate of manners, or e|ven to animadvert on the conduct of the higher ranks, but ina&s;much as the corrupti|on of that conduct, and the depravation of tho&s;e manners, appear to be a natural con&s;e|quence of the vi&s;ible decline of religion.</P>
<P>Of the other obvious cau&s;es which contri|bute to this decline of morals, little will be &s;aid. Nor is the pre&s;ent a romantic attempt to re&s;tore the &s;implicity of primitive man|ners. This is too literally an age of gold, to expect that it &s;hould be &s;o in the poetical and figurative &s;en&s;e. It would be unju&s;t and ab&s;urd not to form our opinions and expec|tations from the pre&s;ent general &s;tate of &s;oci|ety. And it would argue great ignorance of the corruption which commerce, and con|que&s;t, and riches, and arts, nece&s;&s;arily intro|duce into a &s;tate, to look for the fame &s;o|bermindedne&s;s, &s;implicity, and purity among
<PB N="49" REF="029103_0051_0FDF9BC0CC8AC8F0">
the <HI>dregs of Romulus,</HI> as the &s;evere and &s;im|ple manners of elder Rome pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>But though it would be an attempt of de&s;pe|rate hardihood, to controvert that maxim of the witty bard, that
<Q>To mend the world's a va&s;t de&s;ign;</Q>
yet to make the be&s;t of the times in which we live; to fill up the mea&s;ure of our own ac|tual, particular, and individual duties; and to take care that the age &s;hall not be the wor&s;e for our having been ca&s;t into it, &s;eems to be the bare dictate of common probity, and not a romantic flight of impracticable perfection.</P>
<P>But is it then &s;o very chimerical to ima|gine that the benevolent can be &s;ober-mind|ed? It is romantic to de&s;ire that the good &s;hould be con&s;i&s;tent? Is it ab&s;urd to fancy that what has once been practi&s;ed, &s;hould not now be impracticable.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible then not to help regretting that it &s;hould be the general temper of many of the leading per&s;ons of that age which ar|rogates to it&s;elf the glorious character of the <HI>age of benevolence,</HI> to be kind, and con&s;ide|rate, and compa&s;&s;ionate, every where rather than at home: that the rich and the fa&s;hion|able &s;hould be zealous in promoting religious, as well as charitable in&s;titutions abroad, and yet di&s;courage every thing which looks like religion in their own families: that they
<PB N="50" REF="029103_0052_0FDF9B792A4EE308">
&s;hould be at a con&s;iderable expence in in|&s;tructing the poor at a di&s;tance, and yet di&s;|credit piety among their own &s;ervants&mdash;tho&s;e more immediate objects of every man's at|tention whom Providence has enabled to keep any; and for who&s;e conduct he will be finally accountable, ina&s;much as he has helped to corrupt it.</P>
<P>Is there any degree of pecuniary bounty without doors which can counteract the mi&s;|chief of a wrong example at home; or attone for that infectious laxity of principle, which &s;preads corruption wherever its influence ex|tends? Is not he the be&s;t benefactor to &s;oci|ety who &s;ets the be&s;t example, and who does, not only the mo&s;t good, but the lea&s;t evil? Will not that man, however liberal, very imperfectly promote virtue in the world at large, who neglects to di&s;&s;eminate the prin|ciples of it within the immediate &s;phere of his own per&s;onal influence, by a &s;ober con|duct and a blamele&s;s behaviour? Can a ge|nerous but profligate per&s;on attone by his pur&s;e for the di&s;orders of his life, or expect a ble&s;&s;ing on his bounties, while he defeats their effect by a profane couver&s;ation?</P>
<P>In moral as well as political treati&s;es, it is often a&s;&s;erted, that it is a great evil to do no good: but it has not been perhaps enough in&s;i&s;ted on, that it is a great good to do no evil. This &s;pecies of goodne&s;s is not o&s;|tentatious enough for popular declamation; and the value of this ab&s;tinence from vice is
<PB N="51" REF="029103_0053_0FDF9BC6B753C5C8">
perhaps not well under&s;tood by chri&s;tians, be|cause it wants the o&s;ten&s;ible brilliancy of actu|al performance.</P>
<P>But as the <HI>principles</HI> of chri&s;tianity are in no great repute, &s;o their concomitant <HI>quali|ties,</HI> the evangelical virtues, are proportio|nably di&s;e&s;teemed. But tho&s;e &s;ecret habits of &s;elf-controul, tho&s;e interior and unobtru|&s;ive virtues, which excite no a&s;toni&s;hment, kindle no emulation, and extort no prai&s;e, are yet the mo&s;t difficult, and the mo&s;t &s;ub|lime, and, if chri&s;tianity be true, will be the mo&s;t graciou&s;ly accepted by <HI>him</HI> who witne&s;&s;es the &s;ecret &s;truggle and the &s;ilent victory: while the &s;plendid deeds, which have the world for their witne&s;s, and immortal fame for their reward, &s;hall perhaps co&s;t him who atchieved them, le&s;s than it co&s;ts a con&s;cien|tious chri&s;tian to &s;ubdue one irregular incli|nation; a conque&s;t which the world will ne|ver know, and if it did, would probably de|&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>For though great actions performed on human motives are permitted, by the great Di&s;po&s;er, to be equally beneficial to &s;ociety with &s;uch as are performed on purer princi|ples; yet it is an affecting con&s;ideration, that, at the final adju&s;tment of accounts, the politician that <HI>rai&s;ed</HI> a &s;tate, or the hero who <HI>pre&s;erved</HI> it, may mi&s;s of that favour of God, which, if it was not his motive, will proba|bly not be his reward. And it is awful to reflect, as we vi&s;it the monuments ju&s;tly
<PB N="52" REF="029103_0054_0FDF9B7DDF0B99F0">
rai&s;ed by public gratitude, or the &s;tatues properly erected by well-earned admiration, on what may be now the unalterable con|dition of the illu&s;trious object of the&s;e de&s;erved honours; and that he who has &s;aved a &s;tate, may have lo&s;t his own &s;oul.</P>
<P>A chri&s;tian life &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t of two things, almo&s;t equally difficult; the adopti|on of good habits, and the exci&s;ion of &s;uch as are evil. No one &s;ets out on a religious cour&s;e with a &s;tock of native innocence, or actual freedom from &s;in; for there is no &s;uch &s;tate in human life. The natural heart is not a blank paper, whereon the divine &s;pirit has nothing to do but to &s;tamp characters of goodne&s;s; but many blots and defilements are to be era&s;ed, as well as fre&s;h impre&s;&s;ions to be made.</P>
<P>The vigilant chri&s;tian therefore, who acts with an eye to the approbation of his Maker, rather than to that of mankind; to a future account, rather than to pre&s;ent glory, will find, that, diligently to cultivate the "un|weeded garden" of his own heart; to mend the &s;oil; to clear the ground of its indigenous vices, by practi&s;ing the painful bu&s;ine&s;s of extirpation; will be that part of his duty which will co&s;t him mo&s;t labour, and bring him lea&s;t credit: while the fair &s;lower of one &s;hewy action, produced with little trouble, and of which the plea&s;ure is reward enough, &s;hall gain him more prai&s;e
<PB N="53" REF="029103_0055_0FDF9BC86B00E940">
than the eradication of the ranke&s;t weeds which over-run the natural heart.</P>
<P>But the Go&s;pel judges not after the manner of men; for it never fails to make the ab&s;ti|nent virtues a previous &s;tep to the right per|formance of the operative ones; and the re|linqui&s;hing what is wrong to be a nece&s;&s;ary prelude to the performance of what is right. It makes "cea&s;ing to do evil" the indi&s;pen|&s;able preliminary to "learning to do well." It continually &s;ugge&s;ts that &s;omething is to be laid a&s;ide as well as to be practi&s;ed. We mu&s;t "hate vain thoughts" before we can "love God's law." We mu&s;t lay a&s;ide "malice and hypocri&s;y," to <HI>enable</HI> us "to receive the engrafted word."&mdash;Having "a con&s;cience void of offence;" "ab&s;taining from fle&s;hly lu&s;ts," "bringing every thought into obedience"&mdash;the&s;e are actions, or rather negations, which, though they never will ob|tain immortality from the chi&s;el of the &s;tatu|ary, the declamation of the hi&s;torian, or the panegyric of the poet, &s;erve however to con|&s;titute the true chri&s;tian temper, to promote heavenly mindedne&s;s, and to procure the di|vine favour.</P>
<P>And for our encouragement, it is ob&s;er|vable that a more difficult chri&s;tian virtue generally involves an ea&s;ier one. An habit of &s;elf-denial in permitted plea&s;ures ea&s;ily in|duces a victory over &s;uch as are unlawful. And to &s;it loo&s;e to our own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, ne|ce&s;&s;arily
<PB N="54" REF="029103_0056_0FDF9B80F6269838">
includes an exemption from covet|ing tho&s;e of others; and &s;o on of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Will it be difficult then to trace back to that want of early re&s;traint noticed in the pre|ceding chapter, that licence of behaviour which, having been indulged in youth, af|terwards reigns uncontrouled in families; and having infected education in its fir&s;t &s;prings, taints all the &s;treams of dome&s;tic virtue? Nor is it &s;trange that that &s;ame want of religious principle which corrupted our children &s;hould corrupt our &s;ervants.</P>
<P>We &s;carcely go into any company without hearing &s;ome invective again&s;t the increa&s;ed profligacy of this order of men; and the re|mark is made with as great an air of a&s;toni&s;h|ment, as if the cau&s;e of the complaint were not as vi&s;ible as the truth of it. It would be endle&s;s to point out in&s;tances in which the in|crea&s;ed di&s;&s;ipation of their betters (as they are oddly called) has contributed to the growth of this evil. But it comes only with|in the immediate de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent under|taking, to in&s;i&s;t on the &s;ingle circum&s;tance of the almo&s;t total extermination of religion in fa&s;hionable families, as a cau&s;e, adequate of it&s;elf, to any con&s;equence which depraved morals can produce.</P>
<P>Is there not a degree of inju&s;tice in per&s;ons who di&s;cover &s;trong indignation at tho&s;e crimes which crowd our pri&s;ons, and furni&s;h our ince&s;&s;ant executions, and yet di&s;courage not an internal principle of vice; &s;ince tho&s;e
<PB N="55" REF="029103_0057_0FDF9BCA1FC53D60">
crimes are nothing more than that principle put into action? And it is no le&s;s ab&s;urd than cruel in &s;uch of the great as lead di&s;orderly lives, to expect to prevent vice by the laws they make to re&s;train or puni&s;h it, while their own example is a perpetual &s;ource of tempta|tion to commit it. If by their own practice they demon&s;trate that they think a vicious life is the only happy one, with what colour of ju&s;tice can they inflict penalties on others, who, by acting on the &s;ame principle, ex|pect the &s;ame indulgence?</P>
<P>And indeed it is &s;omewhat unrea&s;onable to expect very high degrees of virtue and pro|bity from a cla&s;s of people who&s;e whole life, after they are admitted into di&s;&s;ipated fami|lies, is one continued counteraction of the principles in which they have probably been bred.</P>
<P>When a poor youth is tran&s;planted from one of tho&s;e excellent in&s;titutions which do honour to the pre&s;ent age, and give &s;ome hope of reforming the next, into the family, perhaps, of his noble benefactor, who has provided liberally for his in&s;truction; what mu&s;t be his a&s;toni&s;hment at finding the man|ner of life to which he is introduced diame|trically oppo&s;ite to that life, to which he has been taught that &s;alvation is alone annexed! He has been trained in a whole&s;ome terror of gaming: but now his intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions are forcibly engaged on the &s;ide of play, &s;ince the very profits of his place are made <HI>&s;y&s;temati|cally</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="029103_0058_0FDF9B82A89AAB28">
to depend on the card-table. He has been taught that it was his bounden duty to be de|voutly thankful for his own &s;canty meal, per|haps of barley bread; yet he &s;ees his noble lord &s;it down every day,</P>
<Q>Not to a dinner, but a hecatomb;</Q>
<P>To a repa&s;t for which every element is plun|dered, and every climate impoveri&s;hed; for which nature is ran&s;acked, and art is exhau&s;t|ed; without even the formal ceremony of a &s;light acknowledgment. It will be lucky for the ma&s;ter, if his &s;ervant does not happen to know that even the pagans never &s;at down to a repa&s;t without making a libation to their deities; and that the Jews did not eat a lit|tle fruit, or drink a cup of water, without an expre&s;&s;ion of devout thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Next to the law of God, he has been taught to reverence the law of the land; and to re&s;pect an act of parliament next to a text of Scripture: yet he &s;ees his honourable protec|tor, publicly in his own hou&s;e, engaged in the evening in playing at a game expre&s;sly pro|hibited by the laws, and again&s;t which per|haps he him&s;elf had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the day to pa&s;s an act.</P>
<P>While the contempt of religion was con|fined to wits and philo&s;ophers, the effect was not &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt. But we cannot congra|tulate the ordinary race of mortals on their emancipation from old prejudices, or their indifference to &s;acred u&s;ages; as it is not at all vi&s;ible that the world is become happier
<PB N="57" REF="029103_0059_0FDF9BCC53FAC2E8">
in proportion as it is become more enlighten|ed. We might rejoice more in the boa&s;ted diffu&s;ion of light and freedom, were it not apparent that bankruptcies are grown more frequent, robberies more common, divorces more numerous, and forgeries more exten|&s;ive&mdash;that more rich men die by their own hand, and more poor men by the hand of the executioner &mdash; than when chri&s;tianity was practi&s;ed by the vulgar, and countenanced, at lea&s;t, by the great.</P>
<P>Is it not to be regretted therefore, while the affluent are encouraging &s;o many admira|ble &s;chemes for promoting religion among the children of the poor, that they do not like to <HI>perpetuate</HI> the principle, by encourag|ing it in their &s;ervants al&s;o? Is it not pity, &s;ince the&s;e are &s;o moderately furni&s;hed with the good things of this life, to rob them of that bright rever&s;ion, the bare hope of which is a counterpoi&s;e to all the hard&s;hips they un|dergo here&mdash;e&s;pecially &s;ince, by dimini&s;hing this future hope, we &s;hall not be likely to add to their pre&s;ent u&s;efulne&s;s?</P>
<P>Still allowing, what has been already grant|ed, that ab&s;olute infidelity is not the reign|ing evil, and that &s;ervants will perhaps be more likely to &s;ee religion neglected than to hear it ridiculed; would it not be a merito|rious kindne&s;s, in families of a better &s;tamp, to furni&s;h them with more opportunities of learning and practi&s;ing their duty? Is it not impolitic indeed, as well as unkind, to refu&s;e
<PB N="58" REF="029103_0060_0FDF9B84DCD93548">
them any means of having impre&s;&s;ed on their con&s;ciences the operative principles of chri&s;|tianity? It is but little, barely not to <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> their going to church, or doing their duty at home, unle&s;s their opportunities of doing both are facilitated, by giving them, at cer|tain &s;ea&s;ons, as few employments as po&s;&s;ible that may interfere with both. Even when religion is by pretty general con&s;ent bani&s;hed from our families, that only furni&s;hes a &s;tron|ger rea&s;on why our families &s;hould not be bani&s;hed from religion in the churches.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e opportunities are not made ea&s;y and convenient to them, their &s;uperiors have no right to expect from them a zeal &s;o far tran&s;cending their own, as to induce them to &s;urmount difficulties for the &s;ake of their duty. Religion is never once repre&s;ented in &s;cripture as a light attainment; it is never once illu&s;trated by an ea&s;y, a quiet, or an in|dolent allegory. On the contrary, it is ex|hibited under the active figure of a combat, a race; &s;omething expre&s;&s;ive of exertion, acti|vity, progre&s;s. And yet many are unju&s;t enough to think that this warfare can be fought, though they are perpetually weaken|ing the vigour of the combatant; this race be run, though they are ince&s;&s;antly ob&s;truct|ing the progre&s;s of him who runs by &s;ome hard and interfering command. That that compa&s;&s;ionate judge who cannot but be par|ticularly touched with the feeling of <HI>their</HI> in|firmities, will tenderly allow for their trials,
<PB N="59" REF="029103_0061_0FDF9BD0632DDC00">
and be merciful to their failings, can never be doubted; but what portion of that for|givene&s;s he will extend to tho&s;e who lay on their virtue hard burdens "too heavy for them to bear," who &s;hall &s;ay?</P>
<P>To keep any immortal being in a &s;tate of &s;piritual darkne&s;s, is a po&s;itive di&s;obedience to <HI>His</HI> law, who when he be&s;towed the Bible, no le&s;s than when he created the material world, &s;aid, <HI>Let there be light.</HI> It were well for both the advantage of ma&s;ter and &s;ervant, that the latter &s;hould have the doctrines of the Go&s;pel frequently impre&s;&s;ed on his heart, that his con&s;cience &s;hould be made familiar with a &s;y&s;tem which offers &s;uch clear and in|telligible propo&s;itions of moral duty. The &s;triking interrogation, "how &s;hall I do this great wickedne&s;s, and &s;in again&s;t God?" will perhaps operate as forcibly on an uncultivat|ed mind, as the mo&s;t eloquent e&s;&s;ay, to prove that man is not an accountable being. That once credited promi&s;e, that "they who have done well &s;hall go into everla&s;ting life," will be more grateful to the &s;pirit of a plain man, than that more elegant and di&s;intere&s;ted aphori&s;m, that <HI>virtue is its own reward.</HI> That "he that walketh uprightly walketh &s;urely," is not on the whole dangerous or a mi&s;leading maxim. And "well done, good and faithful &s;ervant!

<PB N="60" REF="029103_0062_0FDF9B8BEAE045C8">
That "we &s;hould do to others as we would they &s;hould do to us," is a portable and compendious mea&s;ure of &s;ocial duty, al|ways at hand, as always referring to &s;ome|thing within him&s;elf, not ami&s;s for a poor man to carry con&s;tantly about with him, who has neither time nor learning to &s;earch for a better. All Seneca's arguments again&s;t the fear of death, never yet reconciled one rea|der to its approach, half &s;o effectually as the humble believer is reconciled to it by that &s;imple per&s;ua&s;ion, "I know that my Re|deemer liveth."</P>
<P>While the modern philo&s;opher is extend|ing the boundaries of human knowledge, by undertaking to prove that matter is eternal; or enlarging the &s;tock of human happine&s;s, by demon&s;trating the extinction of &s;pirit: it can do no harm to an unlettered man to be|lieve, that "heaven and earth &s;hall pa&s;s away, but God's word &s;hall not pa&s;s away." While the former is indulging the profitable enquiry why the Deity made the world &s;o late, or why he made it at all, it will not hurt the latter to believe that "in the beginning God made the world," and that in the end "he &s;hall judge it in righteou&s;ne&s;s."

<HEAD>CHAP. V. The negligent conduct of chri&s;tians, no real ob|jection again&s;t chri&s;tianity.&mdash;The rea&s;on why its effects are not more manife&s;t to worldly men, is, becau&s;e believers do not lead chri&s;|tian lives.&mdash;Profe&s;&s;ors differ but little in their practice from unbelievers.&mdash;Even real chri&s;|tians are too diffident and timid, and afraid of acting up to their principles.&mdash;The ab&s;urdity of the charge commonly brought again&s;t &s;erious people, that they are too &s;trict.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an objection frequently brought again&s;t chri&s;tianity, that if it exhibited &s;o perfect a &s;cheme, if its influences were as &s;trong, if its effects were as powerful, as its friends pretend, it mu&s;t have produced more vi&s;ible con&s;equences in the reformation of mankind. This is not the place fully to an&s;wer this ob|jection, which, (like all the other cavils a|gain&s;t our religion) continues to be urged ju&s;t as if it never <HI>had</HI> been an&s;wered.</P>
<P>That vice and immorality prevail in no &s;mall degree, in countries profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tia|nity, we need not go out of our own to be convinced. But that this is the ca&s;e only be|cau&s;e this benign principle is not &s;uffered to operate in its full power, will be no le&s;s ob|vious to all who are &s;incere in their enquiries. For, if we allow (and who that examines im|partially
<PB N="63" REF="029103_0065_0FDF9BD4A10C7300">
can help allowing?) that it is the natural tendency of chri&s;tianity to make men better, then it mu&s;t be the aver&s;ion to receiv|ing it, and not the faults of the principles, which prevents them from becoming &s;o.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are acquainted with the effects it actually produced in the fir&s;t ages of the church, when it <HI>was</HI> received in its genu|ine purity, and when it <HI>did</HI> operate without ob&s;truction, from its <HI>followers</HI> at lea&s;t, will want no other proof of its inherent power and efficacy. At that period, its mo&s;t decid|ed and indu&s;trious enemy, the emperor Ju|lian, could recommend the <HI>manners</HI> of the Galileans to the imitation of his pagan high prie&s;t; though he him&s;elf, at the &s;ame time, was doing every thing which the mo&s;t inve|terate malice, &s;harpened by the acute&s;t wit, and backed by the mo&s;t ab&s;olute power, could devi&s;e, to di&s;credit their doctrines.</P>
<P>Nor would the efficacy of chri&s;tianity be le&s;s vi&s;ible now, in influencing the conduct of its profe&s;&s;ors, if its principles were hear|tily and &s;incerely received. They would operate on the conduct &s;o effectually, that we &s;hould &s;ee morals and manners growing out of principles, as &s;pontaneou&s;ly and nece&s;&s;a|rily as we &s;ee other con&s;equences grow out of their proper and natural cau&s;es. Let but this great &s;pring have its unob&s;tructed play, and there would be little occa&s;ion to declaim again&s;t this exce&s;s, or that enormity. If the &s;ame &s;kill and care which are employed
<PB N="64" REF="029103_0066_0FDF9B8F5F1CB8C0">
in curing &s;ymptoms, were vigorou&s;ly level|led at the internal principle of the di&s;ea&s;e, the moral health would feel the benefit. If that attention which is be&s;towed in lopping the redundant and un&s;ightly branches, were devoted to the cultivation of a &s;ound and uncorrupt root, the effect of this labour would &s;oon be di&s;covered by the excellence of the fruits.</P>
<P>For though, even in the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible exertion of religious principle, and the mo&s;t diligent practice of all its con&s;equential train of virtues, man would &s;till find evil propen|&s;ities enough, in his fallen nature, to make it nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould counteract them, by keeping alive his diligence after higher attainments, and to quicken his a&s;pirations after a better &s;tate; yet the prevailing tem|per would be in general right, the will would be in a great mea&s;ure rectified; and the heart, feeling and acknowledging the di&s;|ea&s;e, would apply it&s;elf diligently to the on|ly remedy. For though even the be&s;t men have infirmities enough to deplore, commit &s;ins enough to keep them deeply humble, and feel more &s;en&s;ibly than others, the im|perfection of that ve&s;&s;el in which their hea|venly trea&s;ure is hid: the&s;e however have the internal con&s;olation of knowing that they &s;hall have to reckon with one who "know|eth whereof they are made;" who will ac|cept of faith and repentance in&s;tead of &s;in|le&s;s
<PB N="65" REF="029103_0067_0FDF9BD78C574958">
perfection, and of humble &s;incerity in lieu of entire holine&s;s.</P>
<P>All the heavy charges which have been brought again&s;t religion, have been taken from the abu&s;es of it. In every other in|&s;tance the inju&s;tice of this proceeding would be notorious: but there is a general want of candour in the judgment of men on this &s;ub|ject, which we do not find them exerci&s;e on other occa&s;ions; that of throwing the fault of the erring or ignorant profe&s;&s;or on the pro|fe&s;&s;ion it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It does not derogate from the honourable profe&s;&s;ion of arms, that there are cowards and braggarts. If any man lo&s;e his e&s;tate by the chicanery of an attorney, or his health by the blunder of a phy&s;ician, it is commonly &s;aid, that the one was a di&s;grace to his bu|&s;ine&s;s, and the other was ignorant of it; but no one therefore concludes that law and phy|&s;ic are contemptible profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity alone is obliged to bear all the obliquy incurred by the mi&s;conduct of its followers; to &s;u&s;tain all the reproach excited by ignorant, by fanatical, by &s;uper&s;titious, or hypocritical profe&s;&s;ors. But whoever ac|cu&s;es it of a tendency to produce the errors of the&s;e profe&s;&s;ors, mu&s;t have picked up his opinion any where rather than in the New Te&s;tament, which being the only authentic hi&s;tory of chri&s;tianity, is that which candour would naturally con&s;ult for information.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="029103_0068_0FDF9B9193C49F88">
But as worldly and irreligious men do not draw their notions from that pure fountain, but from the polluted &s;tream of human prac|tice; as they form their judgment of divine truth from the conduct of tho&s;e who pre|tend to be enlightened by it; &s;ome charita|ble allowance <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be made for the contempt which they entertain for chri&s;tianity, when they &s;ee what poor effects it produces in the lives of the generality of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians. What do they ob&s;erve there which can lead them to entertain very high ideas of the prin|ciples which give birth to &s;uch practices?</P>
<P>Do men of the world di&s;cover any marked, any decided difference between the conduct of nominal chri&s;tians, and that of the re&s;t of their neighbours who pretend to no religion at all? Do they &s;ee, in the daily lives of &s;uch, any great abundance of tho&s;e fruits by which they have heard believers are to be known? On the contrary, do they not di&s;|cern in them the &s;ame anxious and unweari|ed pur&s;uit after the things of the earth, as in tho&s;e who do not profe&s;s to have any thought of heaven? Do not they &s;eem then to labour as &s;edulou&s;ly in the intere&s;ts of a deba&s;ing and frivolous di&s;&s;ipation, as tho&s;e who do not pretend to have any nobler object in view? Is there not the &s;ame eagerne&s;s to plunge into all &s;orts of follies them&s;elves, and the &s;ame unrighteous &s;peed in intro|ducing their children to them, as if they had never entered into a &s;olemn engagement
<PB N="67" REF="029103_0069_0FDF9BDD3370C708">
to renounce them? Is there not the &s;ame &s;elf-indulgence, the &s;ame luxury, and the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ionate attachment to the things of this world in them, as is vi&s;ible in tho&s;e who do not look for another?</P>
<P>Do not thoughtle&s;s neglect, and habitual di&s;&s;ipation, an&s;wer, as to &s;ociety, all the ends of the mo&s;t decided infidelity? Between the barely decent, and the openly profane, there is indeed this difference; that the one, by making no profe&s;&s;ion, deceives neither the world, nor his own heart; while the other, by intrenching him&s;elf in forms, fancies that he does &s;omething, and thanks God that "he is not like the publican." The one only &s;huts his eyes upon the danger which the other de&s;pi&s;es.</P>
<P>But the&s;e unfruitful profe&s;&s;ors would do well to recollect, that, by a conduct &s;o lit|tle worthy of their high calling, they not only violate the law to which they have vow|ed obedience, but occa&s;ion many to di&s;believe or to de&s;pi&s;e it; that they are thus in a great mea&s;ure accountable for the infidelity of o|thers, and of cour&s;e will have to an&s;wer for more than their own per&s;onal offences. For did they in any re&s;pect live up to the prin|ciples they profe&s;s; did they adorn the doc|trines of chri&s;tianity by a life in any de|gree con&s;onant to their faith; did they ex|hibit any thing of the "beauty of holine&s;s" in their daily conver&s;ation; they would then give &s;uch a demon&s;trative proof, not only
<PB N="68" REF="029103_0070_0FDF9B97F2258640">
of the &s;incerity of their own obedience, but of the brightne&s;s of that divine light by which they profe&s;s to walk, that the mo&s;t determined unbeliever would at la&s;t begin to think there mu&s;t be <HI>&s;omething</HI> in a religion of which the effects were &s;o vi&s;ible, and the fruits &s;o amiable; and might in time be led to "glorify," not <HI>them,</HI> not the imperfect doers of the&s;e works, but "their Father which is in heaven." Whereas, as things are at pre&s;ent carried on, the obvious con|clu&s;ion mu&s;t be, either that chri&s;tians do not believe in the religion they profe&s;s, or that there is no truth in the religion it&s;elf.</P>
<P>For will he not naturally &s;ay, that, if its influences were &s;o predominant, its con&s;e|quences mu&s;t be more evident? that, if the prize held out were really &s;o bright, tho&s;e who truly believed &s;o would &s;urely <HI>do</HI> &s;ome|thing, and <HI>&s;acrifice</HI> &s;omething, to obtain it?</P>
<P>This &s;wells the amount of the actual mi&s;|chief beyond calculation. And there is &s;ome|thing terrible in the idea of this &s;ort of in|definite evil, that the carele&s;s chri&s;tian can never know the extent of the contagion he &s;preads, nor the multiplied infection which <HI>they</HI> may communicate in <HI>their</HI> turn, whom <HI>his</HI> di&s;orders fir&s;t corrupted.</P>
<P>And there is this farther aggravation of his offence, that he will not only be an&s;wer|able for all the po&s;itive evil of which his ex|ample is the cau&s;e; but for the omi&s;&s;ion of all the probable good which might have been
<PB N="69" REF="029103_0071_0FDF9BDEF220EE78">
called forth in others, had <HI>his</HI> actions been con&s;i&s;tent with his profe&s;&s;ion. What a &s;trong, what an almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible convic|tion would it carry to the hearts of unbe|lievers, if they beheld that characteri&s;tic dif|ference in the manners of chri&s;tians, which their profe&s;&s;ion gives one a right to expect! if they &s;aw that di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, that hu|mility, &s;ober-mindedne&s;s, temperance, &s;im|plicity, and &s;incerity, which are the una|voidable fruits of a genuine faith!</P>
<P>But, while a man talks like a &s;aint, and yet lives like a &s;inner; while he profe&s;&s;es to believe like an apo&s;tle, and yet leads the life of a &s;en&s;uali&s;t; talks of an ardent faith, and yet exhibits a cold and low practice; boa&s;ts him&s;elf the di&s;ciple of a meek ma&s;|ter, and yet is as much a &s;lave to his pa&s;|&s;ions as they who acknowledge no &s;uch au|thority; while he appears the proud pro|fe&s;&s;or of an humble religion, or the intem|perate champion of a &s;elf-denying one: &s;uch a man brings chri&s;tianity into di&s;repute; confirms tho&s;e in error who might have been awakened to conviction; &s;trengthens doubt into di&s;belief; and hardens indifference into contempt.</P>
<P>Even among tho&s;e of a better ca&s;t, and a purer principle, the exce&s;&s;ive re&s;traints of timidity, caution, and that "fear of man, which bringeth a &s;nare," confine, and al|mo&s;t &s;tifle the generous &s;pirit of an ardent exertion in the cau&s;e of religion. Chri&s;ti|anity

may pathetically expo&s;tulate, that it is not always "an open enemy which di&s;ho|nours her," but her "familiar friend." And, "what do&s;t thou more than others?" is a que&s;tion which even the good and wor|thy &s;hould often a&s;k them&s;elves, in order to quicken their zeal; to prevent the total &s;tag|nation of unexerted principles, on the one hand; or the danger, on the other, of their being driven down the gulf of ruin, by the unre&s;i&s;ted and confluent tides of temptation, fa&s;hion, and example.</P>
<P>In a very &s;trict and mortified age, of which a &s;crupulous &s;everity was the predominant character, precautions again&s;t an exce&s;&s;ive zeal might, and doubtle&s;s would, be a whole|&s;ome and prudent mea&s;ure. But in these times of relaxed principle and frigid indif|ference, to &s;ee people &s;o vigilantly on their guard again&s;t the imaginary mi&s;chiefs of en|thu&s;ia&s;m, while they run headlong into the real oppo&s;ite perils of a de&s;tructive licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s, puts one in mind of the one-eyed animal in the fable, who, living on the banks of the ocean, never fancied he could be de|&s;troyed any way but by drowning: but, while he kept that one eye con&s;tantly fixed on the &s;ea, on which &s;ide he concluded all the peril lay, he was devoured by an enemy on the dry land, from which quarter he ne|ver &s;u&s;pected any danger.</P>
<P>Are not the mi&s;chie&s;s of an enthu&s;ia&s;tic piety in&s;i&s;ted on with as much earne&s;tne&s;s as
<PB N="71" REF="029103_0073_0FDF9BE0AA157BB8">
if an extravagant devotion were the prevail|ing propen&s;ity? Is not the nece&s;&s;ity of mo|deration as vehemently urged as if an in|temperate zeal were the epidemic di&s;temper of the great world? As if all our apparent danger and natural bias lay on the &s;ide of a too rigid au&s;terity, which required the di&s;|creet and con&s;tant counteraction of an oppo&s;ite principle? Would not a &s;tranger be almo&s;t tempted to imagine, from the frequent in|vectives again&s;t extreme &s;trictne&s;s, that ab|&s;traction from the world, and a mona&s;tic rage for retreat, were the ruling temper; that we were in &s;ome danger in &s;eeing our places of diver&s;ion abandoned; and the enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;cenes of the <HI>Holy Fathers of the de&s;ert</HI> acted over again by the frantic and uncontroul|able devotion of our young per&s;ons of fa&s;hi|on?</P>
<P>It is &s;eriou&s;ly to be regretted, in an age like the pre&s;ent, remarkable for indifference in religion and levity in manners, and which &s;tands &s;o much in need of lively patterns of firm and re&s;olute piety, that many who real|ly are chri&s;tians on the &s;obere&s;t convicti|on, &s;hould not appear more openly and de|cidedly on the &s;ide they have e&s;pou&s;ed; that they a&s;&s;imilate &s;o very much with the manners of tho&s;e about them (which man|ners they yet &s;cruple not to di&s;approve;) and, in&s;tead of an avowed but prudent &s;tead|fa&s;tne&s;s, which might draw over the others, appear evidently fearful of being thought

preci&s;e and over-&s;crupulous: and actually &s;eem to di&s;avow their right principles, by conce&s;&s;ions and accommodations not &s;trictly con&s;i&s;tent with them. They often &s;eem cau|tiou&s;ly afraid of <HI>doing too much,</HI> and <HI>going to far</HI>; and the dangerous plea, the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>living like other people,</HI> of <HI>being like the re&s;t of the world,</HI> and the propriety of <HI>not being par|ticular,</HI> is brought as a rea&s;onable apology for a too yielding and indi&s;criminate confor|mity.</P>
<P>But, at a time when almo&s;t all are &s;inking into the prevailing corruption, how beauti|ful a rare, a &s;ingle integrity is, let the in|&s;tances of Lot and Noah declare. And to tho&s;e with whom a poem is an higher autho|rity than the Bible, let me recommend the mo&s;t animated picture of a righteous &s;ingu|larity that ever was delineated, in

<P>Few indeed of the more orderly and de|cent have any objection to that degree of re|ligion which is compatible with their general acceptance with others, or the full enjoy|ment
<PB N="73" REF="029103_0075_0FDF9BE2DCCD98A0">
of their own plea&s;ures. For a formal and ceremonious exerci&s;e of the outward du|ties of chri&s;tianity, may not only be kept up without exciting cen&s;ure, but will even pro|cure a certain re&s;pect and confidence; and is not quite irreconcileable with a voluptu|ous and di&s;&s;ipated life. So far many go; and &s;o far "as godline&s;s is profitable to the life that <HI>is,</HI>" it pa&s;&s;es without reproach.</P>
<P>But as &s;oon as men begin to con&s;ider re|ligious exerci&s;es not as a decency, but a du|ty; not as a commutation for a &s;elf-denying life, but as a means to promote a holy tem|per, and a virtuous conduct: as &s;oon as they feel di&s;po&s;ed to carry the effect of their devo|tion into their daily life: as &s;oon as their principles di&s;cover them&s;elves, by leading them to withdraw from tho&s;e &s;cenes, and ab|&s;tain from tho&s;e actions, in which the gay place their &s;upreme happine&s;s: as &s;oon as &s;omething is to be <HI>done,</HI> and &s;omething is to be <HI>parted with</HI>; then the world begins to take offence, and to &s;tigmatize the <HI>activity</HI> of that piety, which had been commended as long as it remained <HI>inoperative,</HI> and had only evaporated in <HI>words.</HI></P>
<P>But when religion, like the vital princi|ple, takes its &s;eat in the heart, and &s;ends out &s;upplies of life and heat to every part; dif|fu&s;es motion, &s;oul, and vigour, through the whole circulation; and informs and animates the whole man: when it operates on the practice, influences the conver&s;ation, breaks
<PB N="74" REF="029103_0076_0FDF9B9DA4FBDD70">
out into a lively zeal for the honour of God, and the be&s;t intere&s;ts of mankind; then the &s;incerity, or the under&s;tanding, of that per|&s;on will become que&s;tionable: and it mu&s;t be owing to a very fortunate combination of cir|cum&s;tances indeed, if he can at once pre&s;erve the character of parts and piety.</P>
<P>But it is a folly to talk of being too holy, too &s;trict, or too good. Where there hap|pens to appear &s;ome foundation for the charge of enthu&s;ia&s;m (as there are indeed too often in good people eccentricities which ju&s;tify the cen&s;ure), we may depend upon it, that it pro|ceeds from &s;ome defect in the judgment, and not from any exce&s;s in the piety; for in good|ne&s;s there is no exce&s;s: and it is as prepo&s;ter|ous to &s;ay that any one is too good, or too pious, as that he is too wi&s;e, too &s;trong, or too healthy; &s;ince the highe&s;t point in all the&s;e is only the perfection of that quality which we admired in a lower degree. There may be an <HI>imprudent,</HI> but there cannot be a <HI>&s;uperabun|dant</HI> goodne&s;s. An ardent imagination may mi&s;lead a rightly turned heart; and a weak intellect may incline the be&s;t intentioned to a&s;cribe too much value to things of compa|ratively &s;mall importance. Such an one not having di&s;cernment enough to perceive where the force and &s;tre&s;s of duty lie, may innocent|ly di&s;credit religion by a too &s;crupulous exact|ne&s;s in points of &s;mall intrin&s;ic value.</P>
<P>And even well-meaning men, as well as hypocrites, may think too much is done when
<PB N="75" REF="029103_0077_0FDF9BE9C99AC168">
their "mint" and "ani&s;e" are rigorou&s;ly tithed.</P>
<P>But in ob&s;erving the "weightier matters of the law," in the practice of univer&s;al holi|ne&s;s, in the love of God, there can be no po&s;|&s;ibility of exceeding while there is no limita|tion in the command. We are in no danger of loving our neighbour <HI>better</HI> than our&s;elves; and let us remember, that we do not go be|yond, but fall &s;hort of our duty, while we love him <HI>le&s;s.</HI> If we were commanded to love God with <HI>&s;ome</HI> of our heart, with <HI>part</HI> of our &s;oul, and a <HI>portion</HI> of our &s;trength, there would then be &s;ome colour for tho&s;e perpetu|al cavils about the <HI>proportion</HI> of love, and the <HI>degree</HI> of obedience, which are due to him. But as the command is &s;o definite, &s;o ab&s;o|lute, &s;o comprehen&s;ive, &s;o entire; nothing can be more ab&s;urd than that unmeaning, but not unfrequent charge brought again&s;t &s;erious per&s;ons, that <HI>they are too &s;trict.</HI></P>
<P>The foundation of this &s;illy cen&s;ure is com|monly laid in the fir&s;t principles of education, where an early &s;eparation is &s;y&s;tematically made between duty and plea&s;ure. One of the fir&s;t baits held out for the encourage|ment of children, is, that when they have done their <HI>duty,</HI> they will be entitled to &s;ome <HI>plea&s;ure</HI>; thus forcibly disjoining what &s;hould be con&s;idered as in&s;eparable. And there is not a more common ju&s;tification of that idle and di&s;&s;ipated manner in which the &s;econd half of the Sunday is commonly &s;pent, even
<PB N="76" REF="029103_0078_0FDF9BA3C73B8060">
by tho&s;e who make a con&s;cience of &s;pending the former part properly, than that, "now they have done their duty, they may take their plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>But while chri&s;tian ob&s;ervances are con&s;i|dered as ta&s;ks, which are to be got over to entitle us to &s;omething more plea&s;ant; as a burthen which we mu&s;t endure in order to propitiate an inexorable Judge who makes a hard bargain with his creatures, and allows them ju&s;t &s;o much amu&s;ement in pay for &s;o much drudgery; we mu&s;t not wonder that &s;uch low views are entertained of chri&s;tiani|ty, and that a religious life is reprobated as &s;trict and rigid.</P>
<P>But to him who acts from the nobler mo|tive of love, and the animating power of the chri&s;tian hope, the exerci&s;e is the reward, the permi&s;&s;ion is the privilege, the work is the wages. <HI>He</HI> does not carve out &s;ome mi|&s;erable plea&s;ure, and &s;tipulate for &s;ome mea|gre diver&s;ion, to pay him&s;elf for the hard per|formance of his duty, who in that very per|formance experiences the highe&s;t plea&s;ure, and feels the true&s;t gratification of which his nature is capable.</P>
<P>This reprobated &s;trictne&s;s therefore, &s;o far from being the &s;ource of di&s;comfort and mi|&s;ery, as is pretended, is in reality the true cau&s;e of actual enjoyment, by laying the axe to the root of all tho&s;e turbulent and unea&s;y pa&s;&s;ions, the unre&s;erved and yet imperfect gratification of which does &s;o much more
<PB N="77" REF="029103_0079_0FDF9BEB84F4CC80">
tend to di&s;turb our happine&s;s than that &s;elf-government chri&s;tianity enjoins.</P>
<P>But all precepts &s;eem rigorous, all ob&s;er|vances are really hard, where there is not an entire conviction of God's right to our obe|dience, and an internal principle of faith and love to make that obedience plea&s;ant. A re|ligious life is indeed a hard bondage to one immer&s;ed in the practices of the world, the fle&s;h, and the fa&s;hion. To a perfect chri&s;tian, it is "perfect freedom." He does not now ab&s;tain from &s;uch and &s;uch things, merely becau&s;e they are forbidden (as he did in the fir&s;t &s;tages of his progre&s;s,) but becau&s;e his &s;oul has no longer any plea&s;ure in them. And it would be the &s;evere&s;t of all puni&s;h|ments to oblige him to return to tho&s;e prac|tices, from which he once ab&s;tained with dif|ficulty, and through the le&s;s noble principle of fear.</P>
<P>There is not therefore perhaps a greater mi&s;take than that common notion entertain|ed by the more orderly part of the fa&s;hiona|ble world, that a little religion will make peo|ple happy, but that an high degree of it is incompatible with all enjoyment. For &s;ure|ly <HI>that</HI> religion can add little to a man's hap|pine&s;s which re&s;trains him from the commi&s;|&s;ion of a wrong action, but which does not pretend to extingui&s;h the bad principle from which the act proceeded. A religion which ties the hands, without changing the heart; which, like the hell of Tantalus, &s;ubdues not
<PB N="78" REF="029103_0080_0FDF9BA5852FC628">
the de&s;ire, yet forbids the gratification, is in|deed an uncomfortable &s;tate. Such a reli|gion, though it may gain a man &s;omething on the &s;ide of reputation, will give him but little inward comfort, if his heart be &s;till left a prey to that temper which produced the evil, even though terror or &s;hame may have prevented the outward act.</P>
<P>That people devoted to the pur&s;uits of a di&s;&s;ipated life &s;hould conceive of religion as a difficult and even unattainable &s;tate, it is ea|&s;y to believe. That they &s;hould conceive of it as an unhappy &s;tate, is the con&s;ummation of their error and ignorance: for that a <HI>rati|onal</HI> being &s;hould have his under&s;tanding en|lightened; that an <HI>immortal</HI> being &s;hould have his views extended and enlarged; that a <HI>help|le&s;s</HI> being &s;hould have a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; a <HI>&s;inful</HI> being the pro&s;pect of pardon; or a <HI>fallen</HI> one the a&s;&s;urance of re&s;toration, does not &s;eem a probable ground of unhappi|ne&s;s; and on any other &s;ubject &s;uch rea&s;oning would not be admi&s;&s;ible.</P>

life is utterly de&s;tructive of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. To in&s;tance only in one particular amu&s;e|ment, which is generally thought in&s;ignifi|cant, and is in effect &s;o vapid, that one al|mo&s;t wonders how it can be dangerous: it would excite laughter, becau&s;e we are &s;o broke into the habit, were I to in&s;i&s;t on the immorality of pa&s;&s;ing one's whole life in a crowd. But tho&s;e promi&s;cuous myriads which compo&s;e the &s;ociety, fal&s;ely &s;o called, of the gay world; who are brought together without e&s;teem, remain without plea&s;ure, and part without regret; who live in a round of diver&s;ions, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which is &s;o joy|le&s;s, though the ab&s;ence is &s;o in&s;upportable, the&s;e, by the mere force of ince&s;&s;ant and in|di&s;criminate a&s;&s;ociation, weaken, and in time wear out, the be&s;t feelings and affections of the human heart. And the mere &s;pirit of di&s;|&s;ipation, thus contracted from invariable ha|bit, even detached from all its concomitant evils, is in it&s;elf as ho&s;tile to a religious &s;pirit, as more po&s;itive and actual offences. Far be it from me to &s;ay that it is as criminal; I on|ly in&s;i&s;t that it is as oppo&s;ite to that heavenly mindedne&s;s which is the e&s;&s;ence of the chri&s;|tian temper.</P>
<P>We know that in the mingled ma&s;s which celebrate the orgies of di&s;&s;ipation, are many amiable and well-inclined hearts, whom no|thing but the tyranny of fa&s;hion could have driven thither. But let us &s;uppo&s;e an igno|rant and unprejudiced &s;pectator, who &s;hould

<P>That it could not be the Jewi&s;h, he would &s;oon di&s;cover; for of rites, ceremonies, and external ob&s;ervances, he would trace but &s;lender remains.

His mo&s;t probable conclu&s;ion would be in favour of the Mahometan faith, did not the exce&s;&s;ive indulgence of &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed, in an article of intem|perance prohibited even by the &s;en&s;ual pro|phet of Arabia, defeat that conjecture.</P>
<P>How would the petrified enquirer be a&s;to|ni&s;hed, if he were told that all the&s;e were of a religion meek, &s;piritual, &s;elf-denying; of which poverty of &s;pirit, a renewed mind,

and non-conformity to the world, were &s;pe|cific di&s;tinctions!</P>
<P>When he &s;aw the &s;ons of men of fortune, &s;carcely old enough to be &s;ent to &s;chool, ad|mitted to be &s;pectators of the turbulent and unnatural diver&s;ions of racing and gaming; and the almo&s;t infant daughters, even of wi&s;e and virtuous mothers (an innovation which fa&s;hion her&s;elf forbad till now,) carried with mo&s;t unthrifty anticipation to the frequent and late-protracted ball; would he believe that we were of a religion which has requir|ed from the&s;e very parents, a &s;olemn vow that the&s;e children &s;hould be bred up "in the nurture and admonition of the Lord?"</P>
<P>When he beheld tho&s;e nocturnal clubs, &s;o &s;ubver&s;ive of private virtue and dome&s;tic hap|pine&s;s, would he conceive that we were of a religion which in expre&s;s terms "exhorts young men to be &s;ober-minded?"</P>
<P>When he &s;aw tho&s;e magnificent and bright|ly illuminated &s;tructures which decorate and di&s;grace the very precincts of the royal re&s;i|dence (&s;o free it&s;elf from all the&s;e pollu|tions;) when he beheld the nightly offerings made to the demon of play, on who&s;e cruel altar the fortune and happine&s;s of wives and children are offered up without remor&s;e; would he not conclude that we were of &s;ome of tho&s;e barbarous religions which enjoin un|natural &s;acrifices, and who&s;e horrid deities are appea&s;ed with nothing le&s;s than human victims? If any thing could add to his a&s;to|ni&s;hment,
<PB N="83" REF="029103_0085_0FDF9BF473E124A8">
it mu&s;t be to ob&s;erve, in &s;ome more private temples of this demon, that the fair &s;acrifice is often a voluntary one, &s;elf-offered, and at once both prie&s;te&s;s and victim.</P>
<P>Now, ought we not to pardon our ima|ginary &s;pectator, if he &s;hould not at once con|clude that all the various de&s;criptions of per|&s;ons, above noticed, profe&s;&s;ed the chri&s;tian religion; &s;uppo&s;ing him to have no other way of determining but by the conformity of their manners to that rule by which he had undertaken to judge them? We indeed our|&s;elves mu&s;t judge with greater latitude, and candidly take the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety into the account; which, in &s;ome few in&s;tances perhaps, mu&s;t be allowed to di&s;pen&s;e with that literal &s;trictne&s;s, which more peculiarly belonged to the fir&s;t ages of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>But as this is really a chri&s;tian country, profe&s;&s;ing to enjoy the pure&s;t faith in the pu|re&s;t form; it cannot be unrea&s;onable to go a little farther, and enquire whether chri&s;tian|ity, however firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and general|ly profe&s;&s;ed in it, is really practi&s;ed by that order of fa&s;hionable per&s;ons, who, while they are ab&s;orbed in the delights of the world, and their whole &s;ouls devoted to the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure, yet &s;till arrogate to them&s;elves the honourable name of chri&s;tians, and oc|ca&s;ionally te&s;tify their claim to this high cha|racter, by a general profe&s;&s;ion of their belief in, and a decent compliance with, the forms of religion.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="029103_0086_0FDF9BAFAF422CD0">
This enquiry mu&s;t be made, not by a com|pari&s;on with the &s;tate of chri&s;tianity in other countries (a mode always fallacious, whether adopted by nations or individuals, is that of comparing them&s;elves with tho&s;e who are &s;till wor&s;e;) nor mu&s;t it be made from any notions drawn from cu&s;tom, decency, or any other human &s;tandard; but from a &s;cripture view of what real religion is; from any one of tho&s;e &s;triking and comprehen&s;ive repre|&s;entations of it, which may be found conden&s;|ed in &s;o many &s;ingle pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;acred writings.</P>
<P>Whoever then looks into the Book of God, and ob&s;erves its prevailing &s;pirit, and then looks into that part of the world under con|&s;ideration, will not &s;urely be thought very cen&s;orious, if he pronounce that the confor|mity between them does not &s;eem to be <HI>very</HI> &s;triking; and that the one does not very evidently appear to be dictated by the other. Will he di&s;cover that the chri&s;tian religion is &s;o much as pretended to be made the <HI>rule of life,</HI> even by that decent order who profe&s;s not to have di&s;carded it as an object of faith? Do even the more regular, who neglect not public ob&s;ervances, con&s;ider chri&s;tianity as <HI>the mea&s;ure of their actions</HI>? Do even what the <HI>world</HI> calls religious per&s;ons employ their time, their abilities, and their fortune, as ta|lents for which they however confe&s;s they believe them&s;elves accountable: or do they in any re&s;pect live, I will not &s;ay up to their pro|fe&s;&s;ion

<P>Is it con&s;i&s;tent to declare in the &s;olemn a&s;|&s;emblies that they are "mi&s;erable offenders," and that "there is no health in them," and never in their daily lives to di&s;cover any &s;ymp|tom of that humility which &s;hould naturally be implied in &s;uch a declaration?</P>
<P>Is it rea&s;onable, or con&s;i&s;tent with good &s;en&s;e, earne&s;tly to lament having "followed the de&s;ires of their own hearts," and then deliberately to plunge into &s;uch a torrent of di&s;&s;ipations as clearly indicates that they do not &s;truggle to re&s;i&s;t <HI>one</HI> of them?

<P>Now would it be much more ab&s;urd (for any other rea&s;on but becau&s;e it is not the cu&s;tom) if our legi&s;lators were to meet one day in every week, gravely to read over all the ob&s;olete &s;tatutes, and re&s;cinded acts of parliament; than it is for the order of per|&s;ons of the above de&s;cription to a&s;&s;emble eve|ry Sunday, to profe&s;s their belief in, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to, a &s;y&s;tem of principles, which they do not &s;o much as <HI>intend</HI> &s;hall be bind|ing on their practice?</P>
<P>But to continue our enquiry.&mdash;There is not a more common or more intelligible de|finition of human duty, than that of "Fear God, and keep his commandments." Now, as to the fir&s;t of the&s;e in&s;eparable precepts, can we, with the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of charity, be very forward to conclude that God is re|ally "very greatly feared," in &s;ecret, by tho&s;e who give too manife&s;t indications that they live "without him in the world? And as to the latter precept, which naturally grows out of the other&mdash;without noticing a|ny of the flagrant breaches of the moral law, let us only confine our&s;elves to the allowed, general, and notorious violation of the fourth commandment, and then enquire what apo|logy can be offered for this, by believers at lea&s;t, who &s;cruple not to allow the authority
<PB N="87" REF="029103_0089_0FDF9C0E670FF060">
of that book, which declares, among many other alarming denunciations, that the wilful and habitual offender in any one point is guil|ty of the breach of the whole law.</P>
<P>Shall we have rea&s;on to change our opi|nion, if we take another divine repre&s;entation of the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of religion, and ap|ply it as a touch&s;tone in the pre&s;ent trial&mdash; "Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp;c. and thy neighbour as thy|&s;elf?" Now, judging by inference, do we &s;ee many public proofs of that heavenly-minded|ne&s;s which would be the inevitable effect of &s;uch a fervent and animated dedication of all the powers, faculties, and affections of the &s;oul to him who gave it? And, as to the great rule of &s;ocial duty expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;e|cond clau&s;e, do we ob&s;erve very much of that con&s;iderate kindne&s;s, that pure di&s;inter|e&s;tedne&s;s, that con&s;cientious attention to the comfort of others, e&s;pecially of dependants and inferiors, which might be expected from tho&s;e who enjoy the privilege of &s;o unerring a &s;tandard of conduct? a &s;tandard which, if impartially con&s;ulted, mu&s;t make our kind|ne&s;s to others bear an exact proportion to our &s;elf-love: a rule in which chri&s;tian prin|ciple, operating on human &s;en&s;ibility, could not fail to decide aright in every &s;uppo&s;able ca&s;e. For no man can doubt how he ought to act towards another, while the corre&s;pon|ding &s;ugge&s;tions of con&s;cience and feeling concur in letting him know how he would

wi&s;h, in a change of circum&s;tances, that o|thers &s;hould act towards him.</P>
<P>Or &s;uppo&s;e we take a more detailed &s;ur|vey, by a third rule, which indeed is not &s;o much the principle as the effect of piety.&mdash; "True religion, and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to vi&s;it the fatherle&s;s and widows in their affliction, and to keep him&s;elf <HI>un&s;potted from the world.</HI>" Now if chri&s;tianity in&s;i&s;ts that obedience to the latter injunction be the true evidence of the &s;inceri|ty of tho&s;e who fulfil the former, is the benefi|cence of the fa&s;hionable world <HI>very</HI> &s;trikingly illu&s;trated by this &s;potle&s;s purity, this exemp|tion from the pollutions of the world, which is here declared to be its infallible &s;ymptom?</P>

<PB N="90" REF="029103_0092_0FDF9BF8726CC488">
reading which, while it quiets the con&s;cience by being on the &s;ide of morals, neither awa|kens their fears, nor alarms their &s;ecurity. By dealing in general, it comes home to the hearts of none; it flatters the pa&s;&s;ions of the reader, by a&s;cribing high merit to the perfor|mance of certain right actions, and the for|bearance from certain wrong ones; among which, that reader mu&s;t be very unlucky in|deed who does not find &s;ome performances and &s;ome forbearances of his own. It at once enables him to keep heaven in his eye, and the world in his heart. It agreeably repre&s;ents the readers to them&s;elves as amiable per&s;ons; guilty indeed of a few faults, but never as condemned &s;inners under &s;entence of death. It commonly abounds with high encomiums on the dignity of human nature; the good effects of virtue on health, fortune, and repu|tation; the dangers of a blind zeal, the mi&s;|chiefs of enthu&s;ia&s;m, and the folly of being "righteous over much;" with various other kindred &s;entiments, which, if they do not fall in of them&s;elves with the corruptions of our nature may, by a little warping, be ea&s;ily accommodated to them.</P>

<P>Whatever comparative prai&s;e may be due to the former cla&s;s of writers, when viewed with others of a le&s;s decent order, yet I am not &s;ure whether &s;o many books of frigid mo|rality, exhibiting &s;uch inferior motives of ac|tion, and &s;uch moderate repre&s;entations of duty, have not done religion much more harm than good; whether they do not lead many a reader to enquire what is the lowe&s;t degree

in the &s;cale of virtue with which he may con|tent him&s;elf, &s;o as barely to e&s;cape eternal pu|ni&s;hment; how much indulgence he may al|low him&s;elf, without ab&s;olutely forfeiting his chance of &s;afety; what is the uttermo&s;t verge to which he may venture of this world's en|joyment, and yet ju&s;t keep within a po&s;&s;ibility of hope for the next: adju&s;ting the &s;cales of indulgence and &s;ecurity with &s;uch a &s;crupu|lous equilibrium, as not to lo&s;e much plea|&s;ure, yet not incur much penalty.</P>
<P>This is hardly an exaggerated repre&s;enta|tion: and to the&s;e low views of duty is part|ly owing &s;o much of that bare-weight virtue with which even chri&s;tians are &s;o apt to con|tent them&s;elves: fighting for every inch of ground which may po&s;&s;ibly be taken within the pales of permi&s;&s;ion; and &s;tretching tho&s;e pales to the utmo&s;t edge of that limitation a|bout which the world and the Bible con|tend.</P>
<P>But while the nominal chri&s;tian is per&s;ua|ding him&s;elf that there can be no harm in going <HI>a little farther,</HI> the real chri&s;tian is al|ways afraid of going too far. While the one is debating for a little more di&s;puted ground, the other is &s;o fearful of &s;traying into the re|gions of unallowed indulgence, that he keeps at a prudent di&s;tance from the extremity of his permitted limits, and is as anxious in re|&s;tricting as the other is in extending them. One thing is clear, and it may be no bad in|dication by which to di&s;cover the &s;tate of a

man's heart to him&s;elf: while he is contend|ing for this allowance, and &s;tipulating for the other indulgence, it will &s;hew him that, whatever change there may be in his life, there is none in his heart; the temper re|mains as it did; and it is by the inward frame rather than the outward act, that he can be&s;t judge of his <HI>own</HI> &s;tate, whatever may be the rule by which he undertakes to judge of that of another.</P>
<P>It is le&s;s wonderful that there are not more chri&s;tians, than that chri&s;tians, as they are called, are not better men: for if chri&s;tianity be not true, the motives to virtue are not high enough to quicken ordinary men to ve|ry extraordinary exertions. We &s;ee them do and &s;uffer every day, for popularity, for cu&s;|tom, for fa&s;hion, for the point of honour, not only more than good men do and &s;uffer for religion, but a great deal more than reli|gion requires them to do. For her <HI>rea&s;ona|ble &s;ervice</HI> demands no &s;acrifices but what are &s;anctified by good &s;en&s;e, &s;ound policy, right rea&s;on, and uncorrupt judgment.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e fa&s;hionable profe&s;&s;ors even go &s;o far as to bring their right faith as an a|pology for their wrong practice. They have a commodious way of intrenching them&s;elves within the &s;helter of &s;ome general po&s;ition of unque&s;tionable truth. Even the great chri&s;|tian hope, becomes a &s;nare to them.

That "God is all merciful," is the common reply to tho&s;e who hint to them their danger. This is a fal&s;e and fatal appli|cation of a divine and comfortable truth. Nothing can be more certain than the propo|&s;ition, nor more delu&s;ive than the inference: for their deduction implies, not that he is merciful to &s;in repented of, but to &s;in conti|nued in. But it is a mo&s;t fallacious hope to expect that God will violate his own cove|nant, or that he is indeed "all mercy," to the utter exclu&s;ion of his other attributes of perfect holine&s;s, purity, and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>It is a dangerous folly to re&s;t on the&s;e vague and general notions of uncovenanted mercy; and nothing can be more delu&s;ive than this indefinite tru&s;t in being forgiven in our <HI>own</HI> way, after God has clearly revealed to us that he will only forgive us in <HI>his</HI> way.</P>
<P>But the truth is, no one does truly tru&s;t in God, who does not endeavour to obey him. For to break his laws, and yet to depend on his favour; to live in oppo&s;ition to his will, and yet in expectation of his mercy; to viol|ate his commands, and yet look for his ac|ceptance, would not, in any other in&s;tance, be thought a rea&s;onable ground of conduct; and yet it is by no means as uncommon as it is incon&s;i&s;tent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. View of the&s;e who acknowledge chri&s;tianity as a perfect &s;y&s;tem of morals, but deny its divine authority&mdash;Morality not the whole of reli|gion.</HEAD>
<P>AS in the preceding chapter notice was taken of that de&s;cription of per&s;ons who pro|fe&s;s to receive chri&s;tianity with great reve|rence as a matter of faith, who yet do not pretend to adopt it as a rule of conduct; I &s;hall conclude the&s;e &s;light remarks with &s;ome &s;hort animadver&s;ions on another &s;et of men, and that not a &s;mall one, among the decent and the fa&s;hionable, who profe&s;s to think it exhibits an admirable &s;y&s;tem of morals, while they deny its divine authority; though that alone can make the nece&s;&s;ity of obeying its precepts binding on the con&s;ciences of men.</P>
<P>This is a very di&s;creet &s;cheme: for &s;uch per&s;ons at once &s;ave them&s;elves from the di&s;|credit of having their under&s;tanding impo&s;ed upon by a &s;uppo&s;ed blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to evi|dences and authorities; and yet, prudently enough, &s;ecure to them&s;elves in no &s;mall de|gree, the reputation of good men. By &s;teer|ing this middle kind of cour&s;e, they contrive to be reckoned liberal by the <HI>philo&s;ophers,</HI> and decent by the believers.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="029103_0099_0FDF9C1C961C4B28">
But we are not commonly to expect to &s;ee the pure morality of the Go&s;pel very carefully transfu&s;ed into the lives of &s;uch objectors. And indeed it would be unju&s;t to imagine that the precepts <HI>&s;hould</HI> be mo&s;t &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erved by tho&s;e who reject the authority. The influence of divine truth, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be&s;t prepare the heart for an unre&s;erved obedience to its laws. If we do not depend on that pardon and accep|tance which chri&s;tianity offers, we &s;hall want the be&s;t motive to the actions and perfor|mances which it enjoins. A lively belief <HI>mu&s;t</HI> therefore precede a very hearty and com|plete obedience. We are told, on the very be&s;t authority, that truth &s;anctifies the heart: and the &s;ame authority adds, that, the "word of God is truth." That cammand therefore, for in&s;tance, to &s;et "our affecti|ons on things above," will operate but faint|ly, till that &s;pirit from which the command proceeds, touches the heart, and convinces it that no human good is worthy of the en|tire affection of an immortal creature. An unre&s;erved faith in the promi&s;er mu&s;t pre|cede our worthy performance of any duty to which the promi&s;e is annexed.</P>
<P>But as to a &s;et of duties enforced by no other motive than a bare acquie&s;cence in their beauty, and a cold conviction of their pro|priety, but impelled by no obedience to his authority who impo&s;es them; though we know not how well they might be perform|ed
<PB N="98" REF="029103_0100_0FDF9C0466227B50">
by pure and impeccable beings, yet we know how they commonly <HI>are</HI> performed by frail and di&s;orderly creatures, fallen from their innocence, and corrupt in their very natures.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, nothing but a conviction of the truth of chri&s;tianity can reconcile thinking beings to the extraordinary appearances of things in the Creator's moral government of the world. The works of God are an enig|ma, of which his word alone is the &s;olution. The dark veil which is thrown over the di|vine di&s;pen&s;ations in this lower world, mu&s;t naturally &s;hock tho&s;e who con&s;ider only the &s;ingle &s;cene which is acting on the pre&s;ent &s;tage; but is reconcileable to him who, hav|ing learnt from revelation the nature of the laws by which the great Author acts, tru&s;ts confidently that the cata&s;trophe will &s;et all to rights. The confu&s;ion which &s;in and the pa&s;&s;ions have introduced; the triumph of wickedne&s;s, the &s;eemingly arbitrary di&s;pro|portion of human conditions, accountable on no &s;cheme but that which the Go&s;pel has opened to us&mdash;have all a natural tendency to withdraw from the love of God the hearts of tho&s;e who erect them&s;elves into critics on the divine conduct, and yet will not &s;tudy the plan, and get acquainted with the rules, &s;o far as it has plea&s;ed the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er to reveal them.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="029103_0101_0FDF9C20C81D1E30">
Till therefore the word of God is u&s;ed as "a lamp to their paths," men can neither truly di&s;cern the crookedne&s;s of their own ways, nor the perfection of that light by which they are directed to walk. And this light can only be &s;een by its own proper brightne&s;s; it has no other medium. Till therefore "the &s;ecret of the Lord" is with men, they will not truly "fear him;" till he has "enlarged their hearts" with the knowledge and belief of his word, they will not very vigorou&s;ly "run the way of his commandments." Till they have acquired that "faith without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God," they will not attain that holi|ne&s;s without which no man can &s;ee him.</P>
<P>And indeed if God has thought &s;it to make the go&s;pel an in&s;trument of &s;alvation, we mu&s;t own the nece&s;&s;ity of receiving it as a di|vine in&s;titution, before it is likely to operate very effectually on the conduct. The great Creator, if we may judge by analogy from natural things, is &s;o wi&s;e an oeconomi&s;t, that he always adapts, with the mo&s;t accurate pre|ci&s;ion, the in&s;trument to the work; and ne|ver lavi&s;hes more means than are nece&s;&s;ary to accompli&s;h the propo&s;ed end. If therefore chri&s;tianity had been intended for nothing more than a mere &s;y&s;tem of ethics, &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem &s;urely might have been produced at an infinitely le&s;s expence. The long chain of prophecy, the labours of apo&s;tles, the blood
<PB N="100" REF="029103_0102_0FDF9C0618910C18">
of &s;aints, to &s;ay nothing of the great and co&s;tly &s;acrifice which the go&s;pel records, might &s;urely have been &s;pared. Le&s;&s;ons of mere human virtue might have been deli|vered by &s;ome &s;uitable in&s;trument of human wi&s;dom, &s;trengthened by the vi&s;ible autho|rity of human power. A bare &s;y&s;tem of morals might have been communicated to mankind with a more rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of advantage, by means not &s;o repugnant to human pride. A mere &s;cheme of conduct might have been delivered, with far greater probability of &s;ucce&s;s, by Antoninus the em|peror, or Plato the philo&s;opher, than by Paul the tent-maker, of Peter the fi&s;herman.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity, then, mu&s;t be embraced en|tirely, if it be received at all. It mu&s;t be taken, without mutilation, as a perfect &s;cheme, in the way in which God has been plea&s;ed to reveal it. It mu&s;t be accepted, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> exhibiting beautiful parts, but as pre|&s;enting one con&s;ummate whole, of which the perfection ari&s;es from coherence and dependence, from relation and con&s;i&s;tency. Its power will be weakened, and its energy de&s;troyed, if every caviller pulls out a pin, or ob&s;tructs a &s;pring, with the pre&s;umptu|ous view of new modelling the divine work, and making it go to his own mind. There is no breaking this &s;y&s;tem into portions of which we are at liberty to choo&s;e one, and reject another. There is no &s;eparating the evidences from the doctrines, the doctrines
<PB N="101" REF="029103_0103_0FDF9C2318A1B9A0">
from the precepts, belief from obedience, morality from piety, the love of our neigh|bour from the love of God. If we profe&s;s chri&s;tianity at all, if we allow the Divine Author to be indeed unto us "wi&s;dom and righteou&s;ne&s;s," he mu&s;t be al&s;o "&s;anctifica|tion and redemption."</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity, then, is a&s;&s;uredly &s;omething more than a mere &s;et of rules; and piety, though it never pretended to be the &s;ub&s;ti|tute for a good life, is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;|&s;ary to its acceptance with God. The Go&s;|pel never offers to make religion &s;uper&s;ede morality, but every where clearly proves that morality is not the whole of religion. Pie|ty is not only nece&s;&s;ary as a <HI>means,</HI> but is it&s;elf a mo&s;t important <HI>end.</HI> It is not only the be&s;t principle of moral conduct, but is an indi&s;pen&s;able and ab&s;olute duty in it&s;elf. It is not only the highe&s;t motive to the prac|tice of virtue, but is a prior obligation; and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, even when detach|ed from its immediate influence on practi|cal goodne&s;s. Religion will &s;urvive all the virtues of which it is the &s;ource; for we &s;hall be living in the noble&s;t exerci&s;es of pie|ty, when we &s;hall have no objects on which to exerci&s;e many human virtues. When there will be no di&s;tre&s;s to be relieved, no injuries to be forgiven, no evil habits to be &s;ubdued; there will be a Creator to be ble&s;&s;|ed and adored, a Redeemer to be loved and prai&s;ed.</P>
