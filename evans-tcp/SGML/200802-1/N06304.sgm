<Q>O! that there were &s;uch an Heart in them, that they would fear Me, and keep all my Com|mandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their Children forever.</Q>

<P>_A DESIRE of public Pro&s;perity, is deeply implanted in every be|nevolent Mind; but the Way to obtain it, is frequently mi&s;|taken.</P>
<P>GOD is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ounder of Civil Society, by his Favor alone, it can flouri&s;h in Peace and Plenty. But unthinking Mortals, act as if

they were independent on the divine Govern|ment, and there was no Law e&s;tabli&s;h'd, for the Puni&s;hment of Vice, the Reward of Ver|tue. They expect to be happy, without cea&s;ing to be criminal; and would enjoy the Plea&s;ures of Sin, without fearing it's appoin|ted Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>this their Way is their Folly.</HI> The &s;u|preme Monarch of the Univer&s;e, ever atten|tive to the Felicity of his Creatures; has ex|pre&s;ly declared, that a &s;acred Regard to his Laws, is the only Foundation of &s;olid and abiding Pro&s;perity.&mdash;What el&s;e means the pathetic De&s;ire of my Text, <HI>O that there were &s;uch an Heart in them,</HI> &amp;c. This is the Voice of God to the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and de|mands the &s;erious Attention of this honora|ble A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>IN my following Di&s;cour&s;e, I propo&s;e to vindicate the Ways of God with Man; and &s;hew the Advantages of Piety, not only to particular Per&s;ons but public Communities&mdash;and then apply it to the Occa&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Day.</P>
<P>I AM FIRST, to &s;how the Advantages of Piety to public Communities&mdash;That to <HI>fear</HI>

<HI>God and keep his Commandments,</HI> is the only
Way to &s;ecure the Pro&s;perity of a People.</P>
<P>MEN of Libertine Principles, take Plea&s;ure to repre&s;ent Religion in the mo&s;t di&s;agreable Light, as an Enemy to the Peace and Pro&s;|perity of Mankind: They would per&s;wade us, that the Candidates for an heavenly Inheri|tance, mu&s;t quit every Claim to the Honors and Advantages of Earth. Many who do not openly e&s;pou&s;e the Cau&s;e of Infidelity, &s;eem to think, Artifice generally prevails over Chri&s;tian Candor, and the Man who di&s;mi&s;&s;es all Scruples of Con&s;cience as imaginary Ter|rors, has a fairer Pro&s;pect of Advantage, than tho&s;e who &s;trictly adhere to the Laws of Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;They therefore conclude, that Provinces and Kingdoms, can|not flouri&s;h in Wealth and Grandeur, with|out violating the Precepts of Equity; and de&s;erting the Di&s;cipline of the CHURCH of CHRIST.</P>
<P>BUT in vain does the World &s;peak evil of that, with which they are unacquainted&mdash;In vain do they mi&s;repre&s;ent the De&s;ign of Religion, to affright Mankind from a Submi|&s;&s;ion to it's Empire.&mdash;I know that temporal Pro&s;perity is not the highe&s;t Object of the

Chri&s;tian Ambition; the People of God a&s;pire after &s;ublimer Happine&s;s, than can be obtain'd in the&s;e tran&s;itory Abodes of Guilt and Mi|&s;ery.&mdash;But I know, that temporal Ble&s;&s;ings de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">end from above, and the common En|joyments of Life, acquire a ju&s;t Value, when they are the Gifts of God, and u&s;ed with Sobriety.</P>
<P>THE <HI>great Doctor of the Gentiles</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>Godline&s;s is profitable for all Things.</HI> Our divine Ma&s;ter promi&s;es to tho&s;e that <HI>&s;eek fir&s;t the Kingdom of God</HI> an Addition of every Thing el&s;e. In Conformity to the&s;e Decla|rations, we find, God often di&s;tingui&s;hes in the Cour&s;e of His Providence tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who pay a voluntary Submi&s;&s;ion to the Laws of His Government, and crowns with earthly Honors tho&s;e illu&s;trious Heads for whom are re&s;erv'd Diadems of immortal Glory.</P>
<P>BUT whatever Darkne&s;s may appear upon the Face of Providence, with re&s;pect to par|ticular Per&s;ons; yet this is certain, that pub|lic Vertue, is generally attended with pub|lic Pro&s;perity&mdash;Peace and Plenty reign in tho&s;e happy Countries, where Piety and Ju&s;tice flouri&s;h in the greate&s;t Perfection and Purity.&mdash;To e&s;tabli&s;h this important Truth we may
<PB N="9" REF="007991_0008_102E114283B4E210">
con&s;ider&mdash;The Nature of Religion&mdash;the Conduct of Providence&mdash;the Experience of all Ages.</P>
<P><HI>FIRST.</HI> CONSIDER the Nature of Reli|gion, and you will find it has the highe&s;t Tendency to promote the general Good.</P>
<P>VICE is the grand Di&s;turber of public Happine&s;s&mdash;the guilty Criminal, that cau&s;es all manner of Di&s;orders in Civil Society. <HI>Like a devouring Lion,</HI> it ravages the Earth, and would &s;oon cover the Face of Nature with Cruelty and Violence, if not kept in Chains by the Authority of the Magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>WHAT is it that renders Government, o|riginally de&s;igned for the Good of Mankind, an In&s;trument of Fraud&mdash;Oppre&s;&s;ion&mdash;and Inju&s;tice?&mdash;Is it not, when Per&s;ons clothed with the venerable Character of Magi&s;trates, are more zealous to promote their private In|tere&s;ts, than the public Welfare, or make their own capricious Inclinations the Rule of their Conduct, and extend their Authority beyond what is permitted by the Laws of the Commonwealth?&mdash;Is it not, when they form into Cabals, and are more forward to pro|mote the De&s;igns of a Party, than to advance
<PB N="10" REF="007991_0009_102E1171CF3BF2B8">
the Good of the Whole!&mdash;Is it not, when they are more careful to oblige their Friends and Favorites, than introduce well-qualified Men into Po&s;ts of Honor and Profit?</P>
<P>WHAT is it that ripens a People for De|&s;truction, and opens a Door for Tyranny to enter in, with all it's attendant Train of Evils? It is&mdash;When that dear-bought Liberty, which they derive, an Inheritance from their An|ce&s;tors, degenerates into Licenciou&s;ne&s;s; and an Impatience under the Di&s;cipline of whole|&s;ome Laws, precipitates them into Riot and Rebellion&mdash;When their public Elections are carried on by Intrigue; and their invalua|ble Privileges intru&s;ted with Men, who&s;e Hearts are de&s;titute of the Fear of God,&mdash;who&s;e Hands are &s;tained with the <HI>Wages of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREVER the&s;e Vices prevail, among Magi&s;trates and People, they de&s;troy the good Order of the Community, and evidence it's political Con&s;titution to be under a melancholy Decay, if not ha&s;tning to it's final Di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>BUT on the contrary, the Fear of God is the noble&s;t Pre&s;ervative of civil Society, and lays the firme&s;t Foundation for the Pro&s;perity
<PB N="11" REF="007991_0010_102E114418BAB428">
of all Orders and Degrees of Men.&mdash;It equal|ly extends its Influence to tho&s;e appointed to command, and tho&s;e who are called to obey&mdash;It forms at once the faithful Magi&s;trate, and the peaceable Subject.</P>
<P>WHAT can be more finely adapted, to in|&s;pire the Rulers of Men with Moderation and Fear; than frequently to meditate on the Greatne&s;s of God, and con&s;ider that they are the Subjects of an Almighty Sovereign, in who&s;e Pre&s;ence the Princes of Earth, are but contemptible <HI>Worms of the Du&s;t,</HI> at who&s;e im|partial Bar they mu&s;t give an Account of their Admini&s;tration?</P>
<P>I MAY further ob&s;erve, the Piety of a Ma|gi&s;trate, &s;upports his Authority, encrea&s;es his Reputation, and by this Means extends his Power. The En&s;igns of State with which he is attended, do not render him &s;o re&s;pectable, in the Eyes of the People, as the Splendor of his Virtues.&mdash;How amiable does that Au|thority appear, to which we &s;ubmit, not bare|ly from a Sen&s;e of Duty, but of Choice and Inclination?&mdash;How chearfully do we pay Obedience, when we e&s;teem the Per&s;on, more than we fear his Power; and reverence the
<PB N="12" REF="007991_0011_102E1174E3BA3998">
Goodne&s;s of the Man, more than the Dignity of the Magi&s;trate.&mdash;But Vice when &s;eated <HI>in high Places,</HI> is odious in every Eye, and renders a Government weak and contemptible. How can Rulers expect Obedience, to tho&s;e Laws which they wantonly violate? With what Decency can they puni&s;h Criminals, when they are Companions with them in their Crimes?</P>
<P>THOSE Rulers alone &s;upport the Dignity of their Character, and diffu&s;e Happine&s;s among the People,&mdash;who honor God that has advanc'd them to their elevated Stations, and &s;ubject their derived Power, to the Laws of his Sovereign Empire&mdash;who &s;eek with greater Ardor the Kingdom of Heaven, than the Dig|nities of this inferior Earth&mdash;who e&s;teem them&s;elves not Ma&s;ters, but Fathers of the Common-Wealth&mdash;who pardon with Plea|&s;ure, but puni&s;h with Regret&mdash;who take more Care to &s;ubdue their Corruptions, than extend the Bounds of their Power&mdash;who had rather be exten&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ings to Mankind, than tri|umph over pro&s;trate Nations of Enemies&mdash;who go on in this &s;hining Cour&s;e, not from a De&s;ire to enjoy the vain Phantom of human Glory, but a lively Hope of eternal Felicity.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="007991_0012_102E114669335148">
IF Religion is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the Character of a good Magi&s;trate, it is equally nece&s;&s;ary to form an obedient and loyal People&mdash;A People always prepar'd to &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;t the State, and &s;ubmit to lawful Authority, as the Appointment of Heaven:&mdash;And this not thro' a &s;lavi&s;h Fear of Puni&s;hment, which is a weak and incon&s;tant Motive, but from a Principle of Con&s;cience, which operates, at all Times, in all Places, and is &s;uperior to all worldly Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>THE Fear of God, then, is the Parent of Order, and unites the &s;everal Parts of a Com|munity together, by &s;trong and indi&s;&s;oluble Bonds&mdash;It moderates the Power of Princes by Goodne&s;s, &s;ecures the Fidelity of the Subject from a Sen&s;e of Duty.&mdash;Magi&s;trates of this Character&mdash;are <HI>like Gods,</HI> diffu&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ings upon Earth: And the People will e&s;teem them Mini&s;ters of Heaven ordained for their Good. From this mutual Agreement ari&s;es the Strength and Beauty of Society, and public Pro&s;perity is the native Con&s;equence.&mdash;</P>
<P>I SHALL only add&mdash;The Fear of God renders a People happy, as it in&s;pires them with a Spirit of Union and Charity. It teach|es
<PB N="14" REF="007991_0013_102E117676B0FDE8">
us to regard each other, as the Offspring of the &s;ame Father&mdash;Subjects of the &s;ame King&mdash;Members of the &s;ame Body&mdash;Par|takers of the &s;ame Spirit&mdash;Heirs of the &s;ame Glory. It in&s;tructs Particulars, to &s;ubmit their Intere&s;t to the general Welfare; to pre|&s;erve their proper Bounds; and employ their various Talents, for the common Advantage. God who created all Things by His omnipo|tent Arm, di&s;po&s;es them in beautiful Order; whoever departs out of the Circle, in which he is plac'd by Providence, di&s;turbs the pub|lick Repo&s;e: Whoever de&s;erts his Station, and invades the Province of another, rebels again&s;t the &s;upreme Governor, and introduces exten|&s;ive Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE Go&s;pel is &s;tiled the <HI>Go&s;pel of Peace,</HI> not only becau&s;e it is <HI>a Law of Grace,</HI> and creates Peace in the Con&s;ciences of Men; but al&s;o becau&s;e it is <HI>a Law of Love,</HI> and produ|ces Harmony and Concord in Society. It &s;weetens the Tempers of Mankind, corrects their Pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;mortifys their Lu&s;ts, which render them unea&s;y at Home, and trouble|&s;ome Abroad. It &s;everely condemns Ambi|tion, Avarice, Hatred and Revenge, which are the Cau&s;e, of that Enmity and Divi&s;ion,
<PB N="15" REF="007991_0014_102E1149CBDD2BA0">
which make this World emphatically <HI>a Val|ley of Tears.</HI> It forms in our Brea&s;ts tho&s;e amiable Vertues of Humility, Meekne&s;s, Pa|tience and Charity, which if univer&s;ally practi&s;ed, would transform this Earth into an Image of Heaven.</P>
<P>How inviting would be the Charms of a Society, regulated according to the In&s;titu|tions of the Go&s;pel. Every one content with his Lot, would rejoice in the Pro&s;perity of his Neighbour.&mdash;The Great would command without Haughtine&s;s, and Inferiors &s;ubmit without Murmuring&mdash;The Rich would em|ploy their &s;uperfluous Wealth, to relieve the Mi&s;eries of the Poor; and the Poor gratefully acknowledge the Kindne&s;s of their Benefactors&mdash;Envy would be bani&s;hed from among E|quals, and Contentions fini&s;hed by mutual Conce&s;&s;ions. There would be no Infidelity in Friend&s;hip; no Cen&s;uring in Conver&s;ation. Every one by mutual good Offices become u&s;e|ful and agreable to each other. This People would enjoy a Tranquility which would be a bright Re&s;emblance of that, which is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the Saints above.&mdash;We might hope no Enemies would di&s;turb their Repo&s;e&mdash;if they &s;hould&mdash;God would be their Protector and
<PB N="16" REF="007991_0015_102E1179F360F828">
Friend, and encompa&s;s them with <HI>His Fa|vour as with a Shield.</HI></P>
<P>THIS naturally leads me to &s;ay</P>
<P><HI>SECONDLY,</HI> THE Equity of divine Providence a&s;&s;ures us, that the only Way to &s;ecure the Pro&s;perity of a People, is to <HI>fear God and keep his Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>THE Conduct of Heaven towards public Bodies of Men, is very different from that which God ob&s;erves, in puni&s;hing the Vices, and rewarding the Vertues of private Per&s;ons. The Equity of the divine Di&s;pen&s;ations to particular Men, is often concealed: <HI>Clouds and Darkne&s;s</HI> &s;urround the Throne of his Ju&s;tice; di&s;tingui&s;h'd Vertue is &s;ometimes co|vered with Reproach, and triumphant Wick|edne&s;s crown'd with Applau&s;e: The faithful Servants of Chri&s;t, confin'd in Dungeons, and their bloody Per&s;ecutors advanc'd to Thrones of Dignity. We can't judge who are the Favourites of God, or the Objects of his Di&s;|plea&s;ure, by the Pro&s;perity or Adver&s;ity they meet with in this Life.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="007991_0016_102E114B683B3990">
THIS is no Di&s;paragement to the Ju&s;tice of the great Lord and GOVERNOR OF THE WORLD: For particular Per&s;ons are immortal; the Time appointed to reward or puni&s;h them, is re&s;erv'd for a future State: Then the Ju&s;tice of God will be vindicated, the My&s;teries of His Providence unveil'd, the Maje&s;ty of His Government &s;upported, His loyal People bountifully recompenced, His implacable Enemies &s;everely puni&s;hed: The proud Oppre&s;&s;ors of Mankind, &s;hall expiate their Crimes in eternal Flames; the humble Di&s;ciples of JESUS, triumph in boundle&s;s Fe|licity and Glory.&mdash;We ought not, then, to be &s;urprized, if the Wicked pro&s;per upon Earth; while the Righteous are expos'd to a Variety of Trials.&mdash;<HI>Thro' much Tribulation</HI> the one enter into the <HI>Kingdom of Glory:</HI> by flowery Paths the others de&s;cend to a <HI>World of Darkne&s;s and Mi&s;ery.</HI></P>
<P>BUT this is not the Ca&s;e of public Com|munities, they are of a &s;horter Date. Tho&s;e Motives which now form Men into Societies, will have no Exi&s;tence in a future State. Kingdoms and Common-Wealths will be abo|li&s;h'd forever: Communities of Men, there|fore, can only be rewarded or puni&s;h'd in this
<PB N="18" REF="007991_0017_102E117BD54EB258">
World. Upon this Account, God, in the or|dinary Cour&s;e of His Providence, di&s;tingui&s;hes a wi&s;e and vertuous People, by temporal Ble&s;&s;ings; and bears Te&s;timony again&s;t pre|vailing Iniquity, by public and general Ca|lamities. To expect Pro&s;perity, meerly from worldly Policy; above all, to pretend to e&s;ta|bli&s;h it upon Fraud and Inju&s;tice; is impi|ou&s;ly to affront the Government of GOD, and defy that ALMIGHTY ARM which will cer|tainly, &s;ooner or later, pour out all His Wrath, upon tho&s;e Combinations of Men, who de|&s;pi&s;e His Authority and violate His Laws.</P>
<P>GOD may, indeed, defer the Puni&s;hment of a corrupted People, till they have <HI>filled up the Mea&s;ure of their Iniquities,</HI> and are pre|pared for immediate De&s;truction. He may vi&s;it an holy Nation with His paternal Re|bukes, to purify their Graces, and fit them for more &s;ignal Favors; but in the common Cour&s;e of His Providence, we &s;hall find that <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a Nation:</HI> Public Pro&s;|perity is the Reward of public Vertue.</P>
<P>THIS Conduct is nece&s;&s;ary to humble the Pride of Men,&mdash;re&s;train the Prevalence of Vice,&mdash;and manife&s;t the Power of the <HI>mo&s;t

<P><HI>THIRDLY,</HI> Con&s;ult the Experience of all Ages, and it confirms the Truth of my Text.</P>
<P>THE Heathens them&s;elves were &s;en&s;ible, the Pro&s;perity of a People, depended, not &s;o much on the Number of their Armies, the greatne&s;s of their Courage; as upon a &s;trict Obedience to the Laws of the Common|Wealth, and a careful Attendance on the Duties of Religion. If we con&s;ult the Hi&s;to|ry of all Nations, we &s;hall find that they &s;unk in Reputation, when they degenerated in Morals; the Prevalence of Pride, Luxury and Debauchery, has ever been a fatal Prog|no&s;tic of approaching Ruin.</P>
