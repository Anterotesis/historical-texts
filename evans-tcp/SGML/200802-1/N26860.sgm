<P>IT is an ob&s;ervation I long have made, that the great when they have power, will often make a wrong u&s;e of it, and that tho&s;e who are inferior in rank, have very little chance of ju&s;tice when oppo&s;ed to them; as riches furni&s;h a variety of means both to elude and oppo&s;e, the effective force of the law. Though every one ought to have his full portion of ju&s;tice, yet I believe no one will doubt, that it is not generally the ca&s;e; the rich can elude ju&s;tice by giving great bail, and feeing lawyers high, who by that and other methods, protract the affair till the action dies away<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> by one means or another; there is nothing incomprehen&s;ible in all this&mdash;If the &s;mall fry get in the lea&s;t entramelled in the me&s;hes of the law, they are generally fa&s;tened in the net, and often times puni&s;hed wrongfully. For as Hudibras ob&s;erves,
<Q><L>For ju&s;tice though it puni&s;h crimes,</L>
<L>Stumbles on the innocent &s;ometimes.</L></Q>
And what a horrid thing it is for an innocent man to &s;uffer for another's guilt&mdash;the horror of &s;uch a thing, none but an innocent man can feel. The great in general only think for them&s;elves,

and very &s;eldom extend their thoughts to the happine&s;s and welfare of any but them&s;elves&mdash;wrapt up in their own great|ne&s;s, it would be a kind of degradation for them to de&s;cend to &s;o low a thought. I have often ob&s;erved the death of a great man, (and often a great villain), deplored as a national lo&s;s; while the ingenious mechanic has been laid by on the &s;helf as of no advantage to the nation. But I would a&s;k, which are the greate&s;t benefit to a nation, drones or bees? If then the ingenious mechanic is &s;uffered by a nation to be neglected, it mu&s;t be a lo&s;s to &s;uch a nation, in the effect produced by &s;uch neglect&mdash;to improve in arts, manufactures, and &s;ciences, has been eagerly pur&s;ued by the mo&s;t Gothic and barbarous nations in the world, and &s;hould the enlightened and improving Americans withold their &s;upport and encouragement; &s;hould it be their wi&s;h, after their generou&s;ly holding out an a&s;&s;ylum to foreigners, of ingenuity or otherwi&s;e, to turn upon them with coldne&s;s and di&s;dain; con&s;ider the con&s;equences of ingenuity contemned, or ability di&s;dain'd; &s;ee I &s;ay, and examine what will be the ultimate con&s;equences to the nation by &s;uch a procedure. <HI>Do</HI> not by &s;u&s;picious maneuvres, take advantage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>them,</HI> to ruin <HI>them,</HI> or by low cunning and artifice deprive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of their character and means of living; or by vague and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;u&s;picions, puni&s;h <HI>them</HI> beyond the regular bound and ju&s;t verge of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> law; a circum&s;tance to the &s;ufferer that no com|pen&s;ation can equalize.

<HEAD>THE NARRATIVE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a &s;ecret &s;atisfaction to me, that the pre&s;s is equally free to the meane&s;t individual, as well as to the highe&s;t; pro|vided the pre&s;s is not abu&s;ed: but who depre&s;s and abu&s;e that freedom, more than the combinations who often have it in their power to do as they plea&s;e. Under every con&s;ideration and in every point of view, taking in my late unfortunate ca&s;e and my mechanical profe&s;&s;ion; I find there is no protection for me, for &s;hould there be any robbery committed by opening locks, &amp;c. I am liable (from the nature of my profe&s;&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ugge&s;tion or &s;u&s;picion of any malicious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> who wi&s;hes to injure me, and heaven knows there are too many of the de&s;cription called malicious on this &s;ide the Atlantic, as well as on the other.</P>

<P>That the conduct of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania, on the late robbery, cannot in my opinion, be pardoned either on the &s;core of public ju&s;tice or national policy; but as the affair &s;tands, the public &s;till entertain their &s;u&s;picion, and the matter remains unravelled, owing (if my &s;u&s;picions are well founded and my judgment right, though not competent in law to know) to a certain peculiar incomprehen&s;ibility. As &s;everal glaring reports are in circulation, (which in the body of this work I &s;hall en|deavour to explain), and as per&s;ons are generally the la&s;t to hear what materially concerns them&s;elves; I &s;hall take notice of them, that &s;uch &s;u&s;pected characters may have an opportunity of contra|dicting the rumour; that they may have it in their power to clear their conduct of the heavy &s;u&s;picion which is levelled again&s;t them. For my own part, I have a right to &s;peak, becau&s;e I &s;uffered innocently; and as I am informed no legal &s;teps can be taken to enforce a recompen&s;e for fal&s;e and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">vere impri&s;on|ment, I therefore take the liberty to lay my ca&s;e before my fellow citizens. When I arrived in America little did I think that I was to become an author; and as little did I think that in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ious men were ever liable to &s;uffer, what appears to me pre|judice, malice, and inju&s;tice. The reader will ob&s;erve, the re|ward was tempting and peculiarly titillating to a keen appetite; and by the devouring maw of &s;ome one ready to &s;wallow &s;uch a delicious mor&s;el, many an innocent man has &s;ufferred: for the &s;ake of a great reward, I pre&s;ume in &s;ome mea&s;ure, was the cau&s;e of part of my &s;ufferings; but my innocence has di&s;ap|pointed &s;uch, and given chagrin and di&s;appointment to the bittere&s;t (if not to &s;ay the mo&s;t malicious) of my enemies. If the reward could have been obtained, I &s;urmi&s;e whether or not my life might not have been at &s;take, by fal&s;e repre&s;entations, legally atte&s;ted, and a variety of other attempts combined. The law of this country, &s;ays, the Bank is ju&s;tifiable in taking up any per&s;on and putting him in pri&s;on when any accident happens to them: (for &s;peaking of the bank, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood tho&s;e immediately in, and connected with it) provided the pri&s;oner can be held to bail. The bank found no difficulty in this, as I could be held to &s;uch bail as I could not command; and their power as a body, could form a thou&s;and different ways to en|&s;ure

This being my ca&s;e, my particular wi&s;h is to lay before my friends and fellow citizens, a &s;tatement of the whole tran&s;action; to &s;hew them and the world at large, the cruel treatment I have received, and which I conceive is not to be exceeded if equaled, (con&s;idering the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">u&s;e in which I &s;uf|fered) by any civilized nation.</P>
<P>FRIENDS AND FELLOW CITIZENS,</P>
<P>ABOUT the third of the month of May, 1797, I was em|ployed in making fixtures and preparations for the book vault, which was built on the fir&s;t &s;tory of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania. On the 7th of July following, I fini&s;hed two iron doors under the direction of one Samuel Robin&s;on, a carpenter, (belonging or working at afore&s;aid Bank, as I &s;uppo&s;e), I ob&s;erved to him at that time, (and he has &s;ince acknowledged that I told him) the &s;tupidity of making iron doors on that con&s;truction, and at the &s;ame time telling him the in&s;ecurity of the locks; and as he was entru&s;ted with the whole charge of the work, it was his duty to inform the Pre&s;ident of the Bank of tho&s;e impediments I laid down to him at that early period. The lock of the inner door is a common iron rim lock, with two tumblers and a bra&s;s bolt. The chief de&s;ign of &s;uch locks are for cabbin doors, as the &s;alt water has more effect on iron bolts than on tho&s;e of bra&s;s. The outer door lock is an old room door iron-rim lock, with the latches taken out (the latches are in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to this day); and as this publication may no doubt reach Eu|rope, where grand &s;ecurities are generally under&s;tood by bankers, merchants, and tho&s;e ingenious mechanics who manufacture the &s;ame; I only a&s;k, What mu&s;t tho&s;e men think or &s;ay, to hear of a bank of &s;uch magnitude being robbed, for even a compting hou&s;e is a &s;trange thing there? but if rightly con|&s;idered, How can it be otherwi&s;e, or &s;u&s;pected otherwi&s;e; when &s;uch va&s;t property is only under the &s;ecurity of a ten or twelve inch room door lock? It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to de&s;cribe the plan of a bank lock&mdash;Neither is it my place to give a clear definition of any thing I manufacture, (not to &s;ay but I would do it), but I have been &s;everal times treated in this manner, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, After I have de&s;cribed the manner that &s;uch and &s;uch things were to be done, &s;ome paltry character carried off the plan el&s;ewhere, and got it done in a bungling manner.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="035752_0007_100663C8D0808C60">
Second, If you attempt to de&s;cribe the be&s;t mode of working, it is but very &s;eldom li&s;tened to, and only an&s;wered in a low way, he or they only wanted a job for them&s;elves; and people who po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e temporary ideas often reflect on the hone&s;t trade&s;man who warns <HI>them</HI> of their <HI>danger.</HI></P>
<P>In the early part of 1798, I waited on Mr. Fox, Pre&s;ident of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania, by the de&s;ire of Mr. Stocker, and as the &s;ubject of building a new Bank was then in agitation, I carried with me a box of wards; I only &s;hewed him that work, but did not explain the utility of it&mdash;(let work &s;hew it&s;elf when fini&s;hed). At this meeting there was Mr. Fox&mdash;Smith the Ca|&s;hier, and my&s;elf. A conver&s;ation took place, opened by me. The conver&s;ation is as nearly as I can rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">llect, thus&mdash;I told them I made the iron door and lock for the Bank that was rob|bed to the northward, and that that lock was of a con&s;truction which I had never made before; that it required two keys to open the lock, and but one key hole; that the Pre&s;i|dent carried one key, the Ca&s;hier the other, and that no money could be get out of the vault except bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h keys were pre&s;ent. The robbery of the bank to the northward Mr. Fox and my|&s;elf perfectly agreed from report; that the inhabitants where this Bank is were divided, even private families were &s;eparate in opinion. The Pre&s;ident and Ca&s;hier were jealous of each other&mdash;the Pre&s;ident had one party, and the Ca&s;hier had another party. Whether any per&s;on ever borrowed any thing from this conver&s;ation, I may be pre&s;umed to entertain my apprehen&s;ions from late circum&s;tances. The reader will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that I was not applied to for this iron door and lock, until &s;ometime after the robbery of the northern Bank.</P>
<P>About the 4th or 5th of Augu&s;t, the Yellow Fever had a&s;&s;um|ed an alarming appearance, and the citizens were removing with precipitation in all directions; I was at this time employed in making &s;everal pieces of work for the temporary removal of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania, to a large hou&s;e adjoining; which was for|merly occupied as a boarding hou&s;e for young ladies: I was &s;till working under Robin&s;on the carpenter, who called at my &s;hop and left word with my apprentice to &s;top the work, and that he would call and tell me what for. I waited a day or two&mdash;Being a little unea&s;y. I went to Lodge Alley where the prepa|rations were &s;till going on and found Robin&s;on; I a&s;ked him why the work was &s;topped, his an&s;wer to me was, that he would <HI>put me up to it by and by,</HI> at the &s;ame time giving me &s;trict charge to take no notice to the bricklayers;
<PB N="9" REF="035752_0008_100663CC12208890">
however he never <HI>put me up</HI> to any thing, or his meaning for acting in this way. On Thur&s;day about the 9th or 10th of the &s;ame month, Robin&s;on brought two iron doors on a dray, (tho&s;e were the two doors which I made about a twelve month before) for the book vault&punc; together with the old rim locks, keys, &amp;c. the doors were to be altered in the following order, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the door which was on the out&s;ide of the book vault was made the in&s;ide of the ca&s;h vault, and the in&s;ide door of the former, was made the out&s;ide of the latter, which was done by removing the hinges of each door to that fide which the locks were on; which was a complete rever&s;e of the whole work. New key-holes were cut, &amp;c. On Friday I began to operate on the doors, after doing Mr. Stocker's work. In the afternoon I was vi&s;ited by Robin&s;on the carpenter, who brought a per&s;on with him, a &s;tranger to me. They both took a par|ticular ob&s;ervation of the locks, keys, &amp;c. I told Robin&s;on at this time, that tho&s;e locks were not fit for a bank in the hearing of this &s;tranger. (The reader will plea&s;e to keep in direct and point blank view this &s;tranger, and there may be a po&s;&s;ible &s;urmi&s;e of the character of &s;ome of his connections). During the whole work, Robin&s;on informed me, that Smith the Ca&s;hier, would not employ me after this was done, owing to the delay. I an&s;wered it made little difference to me. I gave Robin&s;on and his companion &s;omething to drink, and they both went away towards Second-&s;treet. They had not been gone above ten minutes, when Robin&s;on's companion (the &s;tranger,) came back, and went into my &s;hop while I was an&s;wering a young woman at the door; I took no notice of him, as he appeared to be Robin&s;on's confidential friend and companion. He did not &s;top above a minute, and came to the door. I &s;aid I was in a hurry, and mu&s;t work all night, as the Bank was in &s;uch ha&s;te for their work being done. Robin&s;on's companion an&s;wered, that he would &s;ee all Banks damn'd before he would kill him&s;elf this hot weather. He then took his cour&s;e towards Front-&s;treet&mdash;he did not follow Robin&s;on: whether they met again immediately or not, I cannot tell, but &s;uppo&s;e they did. Next day (being Saturday), both doors, locks, &amp;c. were carried to Carpenter's-Hall, where the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania was removed to. The front door of the vault was hung, the lock fixed complete, the in&s;ide door was hung; but the lock was not &s;crewed on, owing to the following circum&s;tances. A large bar of iron which is fixed in the brick-work, and &s;erves as a lock-box or &s;taple, the door
<PB N="10" REF="035752_0009_100663CF4D48ECB8">
being too broad, was brought back to my &s;hop, to have a mor|tice cut out of the front &s;tyle, to receive the above bar or lock|box. (It is to be ob&s;erved, that the lock belonging to this door remained in the Bank all Saturday, Sunday, and part of Mon|day), when both doors were fixed to the &s;atisfaction of the Bank. About this time, another &s;mith, (not Smith the Ca&s;hier), was employed in fitting two doors belonging to another vault, which was kept a profound &s;ecret from me. I now began to look on Robin&s;on with an eye of jealou&s;y, and where his drift would run, was &s;till unfore&s;een to me. The next work I did for the Bank, was altering &s;everal lamp irons, mounting lamp po&s;ts, &amp;c. but to a certainty, I was not in that Bank after the 12th or 13th of the month, being then entirely done with their work. About this time, the Yellow &s;ever began to increa&s;e. I made a &s;mall hydraulic engine for Mr. Cramond. About the 20th or 22d of the month, I was walking down Market-&s;treet, with an intention of buying &s;ome peaches at Market-&s;treet ferry; as I came round the corner and got abrea&s;t of the river Delaware, I there &s;aw Robin&s;on and his companion (who was with &s;aid Robin&s;on at my &s;hop), fitting drinking together: and it is to be ob&s;erved, that Robin&s;on and my&s;elf never met without a&s;king each other to drink but at this time. I never &s;aw two men &s;o much&punc; alarmed and confu&s;ed in my life, as they were: I &s;aw their alarm and noticed it, Robin&s;on and his companion &s;aw the di&s;covery I had made on their apparent embarra&s;&s;ed countenances; but I could not tell what de&s;ign they were about, to give them &s;uch an alarm, or what cau&s;e it could ari&s;e from. After they got the mu&s;cles of their faces compo&s;ed, Robin&s;on called me from the water &s;ide&mdash;He put the following que&s;tions to me. Mr. Lyon what brought you this way? Are you not afraid? the Yellow fever broke out here. I an&s;wered, What brought you this way? Are you not afraid? Mr. Lyon do you mean to go out of town? I do not know. Do <HI>you</HI> mean to go out of town? He an&s;wered he did not know. Says Robin&s;on, Mr. Lyon there is a bar wanted for &s;ome of the doors of the Bank: he mentioned the door; but I do not recollect which door. His companion an&s;wered, Damn it, there will be no occa&s;ion for that. I told them, I was ready for them at all times. They were drinking either porter or beer &s;angaree, they never a&s;ked me to drink, and I thought I could perceive by their confu&s;ed and apparent embarra&s;s'd countenances, they would prefer my ab&s;ence to my pre&s;ence; I left them, and went to a peach beat, and bought &s;ome
<PB N="11" REF="035752_0010_100663D0D355EBB0">
peaches, and carried them to my &s;hop. Having nobody there but my apprentice, I &s;aid to him Jeamie, I &s;aw Robin|&s;on, and the &s;tranger that was with him when we were doing the iron doors, at Market-&s;treet ferry; they &s;eemed to me to be in deep &s;tudy, I don't think they are after any good.</P>
<P>The la&s;t piece of &s;mith-work I done, was a guard iron to a gla&s;s ca&s;e for Mr. Dob&s;on, it was fixed on Saturday the 25th, before breakfa&s;t. This day I was re&s;olved to go out of town, I hired accordingly a hor&s;e and chair, and taking my apprentice with me, went down to Mr. Leiper's e&s;tate in Che&s;ter, where it was my intention to re&s;ide, as I had been in that gentleman's employ; if he could accommodate me while the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ever la&s;ted I thought it might have been an advantage to both; but he was not there; I therefore returned to Philadelphia the &s;ame evening. If the fever had not broke out (or a report that it was) at Bo&s;ton, it was my full determination to have gone there to work; I heard of a new bank building there, and it was my wi&s;h to work and be indu&s;trious as long as I was young and able. For &s;ome time previous to this, we (my apprentice and my&s;elf) were obliged to &s;leep in the &s;hop, as the Yellow fever was next hou&s;e to mine. On Sunday the 26th, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at break|fa&s;t in the &s;hop, eat dinner at Lebanon, and &s;upped with the family of my apprentice. Monday went into Bucks county about 20 miles, to farmer Paul's, where my old landlady and her fami|ly re&s;ided, (&s;he being &s;i&s;ter to Jo&s;eph Paul). The family were making me up a piece of linen for &s;hirts; I took leave of the family with a full determination to go to the capes of Dela|ware. Tuesday 28th of Augu&s;t, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ore part of the day was taken up in procuring a pa&s;&s;age for the capes, which I found about 3 o'clock P.M. I had &s;ome linen in the wa&s;h, and be|ing clo&s;e tied to time, I gave my apprentice orders to go on board the &s;chooner, lying at Arch-&s;treet wharf, commanded by captain Edward Collins, bound to Broadkill creek, near Lewis|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">own; as my linen would take &s;ome time in drying. The wind being &s;outherly, the &s;chooner took more time than u&s;ual to beat down; I ordered my apprentice to heave out a &s;ignal at Almond-&s;treet wharf, which was done. I went on board of &s;aid &s;chooner about 5 o'clock P.M. taking a bottle of rum, pro|vi&s;ions, clothing, &amp;c. The crew and pa&s;&s;engers con&s;i&s;ted of the captain with his wife, who had been newly married, a young man before the ma&s;t, a young woman, my&s;elf and James M'Ginley my apprentice. I took a proper view of all hands, and found them to be truly Delaware &s;hallop-hands. Our &s;choo|ner
<PB N="12" REF="035752_0011_100663D2838F3D58">

The peak hallyards had three or four knots, and it was with great difficulty &s;ome times to get the knots through the blocks either way; the fore&s;ail was pa&s;&s;able; the gibb was a delicate piece of goods, the upper part being made fa&s;t to a woollen &s;tocking. Who would &s;up|po&s;e that the exalted commander of &s;uch a temporary un&s;eam|ed leaky machine as this &s;chooner or &s;hallop; &s;hould, or could have the con&s;cience to a&s;&s;ume more dignity, more importance, and more affectation than the commander of a fir&s;t-rate man of war in his Britanic maje&s;ty's navy&mdash;but that was the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>We went down the river next day being Wedne&s;day 29th, <HI>all well</HI> on board. I never &s;aw my boy in higher &s;pirits, from the time he came to me. On Thur&s;day 30th, my apprentice began to complain, and from the nature of his complaint, and what I had heard of concerning the Yellow fever, &s;eemed to corre&s;pond. In this forlorn &s;ituation, I did not know what in the world I &s;hould do; having no medicine on board, being no judge of his di&s;order, and far from home, where no me|dical aid could be called to his relief; was to any candid, feel|ing per&s;on; one of the greate&s;t trials of mind a man can un|dergo&mdash;it was the greate&s;t I ever met with. We had a high wind, and a heavy &s;well, and was obliged to put into Quahan|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y for &s;afety. The &s;torm abated towards the evening, and we proceeded on our voyage. Next day, Friday 31&s;t, my ap|prentice continued very &s;ick: became quite weak, and lo&s;t the u&s;e of his limbs; and had it not been that I kept a watchful eye over him, he would have fallen overboard &s;everal times; in this low &s;ituation, I was obliged to hold him over the gun|nel: and the ri&s;que I ran may ea&s;ily be conceived; as our blan|kets were frequently put together. On Saturday the fir&s;t of September, we came into Broadkill creek. After we had &s;ailed up the creek a con&s;iderable way, the &s;chooner, or &s;hallop run aground. We went on &s;hore about 10 or 11 o'clock A.M. My apprentice &s;eemed much better, but like my&s;elf, quite un|acquainted with the nature of his di&s;order. All his actions, and behaviour, appeared to me like a man in a &s;tate of intoxication. We travelled acro&s;s a &s;alt mar&s;h, and the fir&s;t hou&s;e we came

to, was a Mr. Fi&s;her's, who gave us &s;ome cyder to drink, and likewi&s;e gave us directions to a tavern, which was two miles forward. I &s;aid to my apprentice, I will go forward, and do you walk on at your lei&s;ure. I &s;aw by this time he was getting wor&s;e again, he could not wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k without &s;tag|gering; the leaders of his neck were become &s;o weak, that his head was like a &s;hips ma&s;t, having lo&s;t all her braces; it is impo&s;&s;ible for any per&s;on to de&s;cribe my &s;ituation; having no medicine with me, and being a &s;tranger to the dreadful di&s;order he was labouring under; at the &s;ame time hearing &s;o much of talk of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ever and ague, I was led to believe that it was that di&s;order he was labouring under. I went forward and pa&s;&s;ed through two woods, and arrived at the tavern kept by Cornelius Fleetwood, about &s;even miles from Lewi&s;town. Mrs. Fleetwood got dinner ready for us. After waiting a con&s;iderable time, I began to be unea&s;y&mdash;I went back the &s;ame road but could &s;ee nothing of my apprentice&mdash;Then went through both woods where I found him lying a&s;leep under a tree, having not gone far from the &s;pot where I left him at fir&s;t. I rai&s;ed him up, and with va&s;t difficulty got him to Fleetwood's tavern. We both &s;at down to dinner, and much to my &s;urprize, Sir, &s;ays he, I cannot eat. I prevailed on him to take a di&s;h of coffee, which he con&s;ented to. He let fall the &s;aucer. Mrs. Fleetwood &s;tanding by, I made an ex|cu&s;e for him. If even I had been certain that it was the Yellow fever that was his di&s;order, my own idea &s;ugge&s;ted it would have been improper to have di&s;clo&s;ed it on his account; as I was well a&s;&s;ured we &s;hould not have long found &s;helter. Af|ter dinner I prepared to walk to Lewi&s;town, telling Mrs. Fleetwood to let my boy have whatever he wanted. I then took leave of him, telling him I would be with him next morning, and bring &s;ome medicine. I proceeded to Lewi&s;town, and arrived about five o'clock, P.M. and fell in with an old acquaintance, Captain Learmonth. Eat &s;upper with him. Af|ter &s;upper we took a walk about town; fell in company with Mr. Jo&s;hua Hall, who engaged with me for my boy to go to work for him; I &s;lept that night at Mr. Elliot's tavern: next morning being Sunday, the 2d of September, I &s;haved my&s;elf &punc; eat breakfa&s;t with Mr. Elliot's family; I then bought half an ounce of bark for my boy, concluding in my own mind that his di&s;order was the fever and ague. I &s;et off for Fleetwood's tavern, where I had left my boy, and there being two county roads, I was directed by a black man the wrong road, which
<PB N="14" REF="035752_0013_100663D8E0C538A0">
led to Indian river; met a country gentleman, and from him received information, that I was &s;ix and a half miles out of the proper road. Being on foot, the day exce&s;&s;ive hot; and my anxiety of mind in regard to my boy made me like a per&s;on di&s;tracted. However by the goodne&s;s of the country people, I was directed from one farm to the other, and came to Fleet|wood's tavern, where I found my apprentice in a &s;hocking &s;ituation. I immediately procured two doctors, and when they met in the room they differed in opinion re&s;pecting the di&s;|order. Doctor Wil&s;on of Lewi&s;town, declared it to be the Yellow fever; Doctor Little, (from I know not where) in&s;i&s;ted it was the nervous fever. I was to receive for the boy the aid of both, therefore it was not proper for me to differ with either, as I was no Doctor my&s;elf. However Doctor Wil&s;on's opinion proved to be right. I cannot help remarking the mode&s;ty and care that this gentleman treated me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ith, and his &s;ympathetic feeling for my perilous &s;ituation. Mon|day, September 3d, my boy continued very ill; had him bled, and bathed with hot vinegar, and &s;ome herbs by the direc|tion of Doctor Little; at the &s;ame time giving him Doctor Ru&s;h's po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ders in mola&s;&s;es&mdash;found that the calomel did not lay on his &s;tomach, we found &s;ugar to an&s;wer better. I nur&s;ed him night and day till Tue&s;day morning, 4th September, when about &s;ix o'clock that morning he died.</P>
<P>Here I cannot help adding my &s;orrowful regret for the lo&s;s of one of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing youths, perhaps in America; he was aged about 19 years, and had been with me about nine months. I took (while with me) all the pains in my power to in&s;truct him in my profe&s;&s;ion; and began to in&s;truct him in the knowledge of the u&s;eful problems of Euclid's Ele|ments: he began to &s;ee into the &s;tupidity of the old mode of working which gave him an enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit of enquiry; he was hone&s;t; his principles were good; and he had every ap|pearance of becoming a u&s;eful member of &s;ociety, and an ornament to his country. The attachment of this lad towards me was wonderful from many in&s;tances; and la&s;tly, when we were obliged to &s;leep in the &s;hop; (as I have before ob&s;erved on account of the Yellow fever exi&s;ting next-door to my hou&s;e) he made his bed at my feet, and after a hard days work, groaning under the burthen of heavy labour; he frequent|ly would feel my feet in the night, and wake me and a&s;k if I was well: it is wrong to reflect, but the lo&s;s I &s;u&s;tained by the death of this promi&s;ing youth, I am certain I &s;hall never retrieve.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="035752_0014_100663DA648E42D8">
I got a coffin made for him, and put him into the coffin my|&s;elf, and had all the difficulty attendent on &s;uch a mournful accident on my own &s;houlders, by this time: I had become &s;o weak as to be &s;carcely able to follow him to the grave, to &s;igh a la&s;t farewel to his departed &s;pirit. After burying him in Squire Hazard's burying ground, I was obliged to &s;tay, clo&s;e in Fleetwood's tavern where I was like a pri&s;oner: all his cu&s;tomers left him, a &s;chool hou&s;e ju&s;t at hand every &s;cho|lar for&s;ook, I can hardly de&s;cribe the deplorable &s;itua|tion in which I was placed. In the &s;pace of a few days af|ter having got every thing clean away; the alarm began to wear off, and though I might venture into Lewi&s;town, as the people there were afraid I would come too &s;oon and bring the infec|tion: I remained in Fleetwood's till Friday 7th September, when I propo&s;ed to Mr. Fleetwood to go to Lewi&s;town, as I was without company: he agreed. I a&s;ked him what I had to pay, he went and con&s;ulted with his wife, and he brought me in debt &s;ix pounds, I told him I had not &s;o much money left, and to of|fer him a note I told him it was what I could not accept of my|&s;elf, I addre&s;&s;ed Mr. Fleetwood in the&s;e words, Sir, I have but thirteen dollars and a half, I &s;hall want &s;ome ready ca&s;h in Lewi&s;town, and I am far from home; will you accept of my watch as I am a &s;tranger to you, and I will pay you the &s;ix pounds, when you come to Philadelphia, (which has been &s;ince done) we were both &s;atisfied, &s;hook hands and parted. I went into Lewi&s;town this day, in which place after my arrival I was &s;pending my time very agreeable, in fi&s;hing, repairing guns, cof|fee mills, &amp;c.</P>
<P>About the 12th, or 13th, of the month, I was told by one Samuel Edwards, a pilot, that a bank was robbed: he was not certain as to what bank, but believed it to be the bank of Penn|&s;ylvania; I gave my&s;elf no concern about which bank, I after|wards &s;aw an account of the robbery in a new&s;paper, I &s;till gave my&s;elf no concern, but I began to think who could be the mo&s;t likely per&s;on that had committed this robbery: my &s;u&s;pi|cions were &s;trongly levelled again&s;t the carpenter and the &s;tran|ger, I &s;aw drinking with him at Market-&s;treet ferry.</P>
<P>On Sunday about the &s;ixteenth of the month, a Mr. Hun|ter and his wife came to Lewi&s;town, with whom I formerly lodged in Philadelphia; having from that circum&s;tance a know|ledge of, or intimacy with each other for a few years before, we conver&s;ed about the death of &s;everal acquaintances, and the &s;ubject of the late robbery of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania; but he

never hinted that there was any &s;u&s;picions again&s;t me till next day (Monday), when as I was walking pa&s;t the hou&s;e of Mr. Elliot, Mr. Hunter, called me, and a&s;ked me to take a drink with him: he then repeated the &s;tory of the Bank robbery, tel|ling me, that there were many per&s;ons taken up, mentioning three names; but I did not recognize any of the names he men|tioned, I then a&s;ked him if there was one of the name of Ro|bin&s;on, taken up, he &s;aid he could not tell, he began to tell me a long circuitous &s;tory, adding that he was &s;orry there were many innocent people &s;u&s;pected: from his manner and mode of conver&s;ation I was induced to a&s;k him if I was &s;u&s;pec|ted, he told me that I was, I a&s;ked him his rea&s;on for not tel|ling me &s;ooner, he &s;aid he did not like to affront me. I then told him I would go to Philadelphia, which he &s;trongly advi&s;ed me to do. I then called my landlord Captain Learmonth, and con&s;ulted with him, who intirely approved of my re&s;olution. In which manner I could get a pa&s;&s;age to Philadelphia, I was entirely at a lo&s;s. I went immediately to a Captain We&s;t, who was to &s;ail next day to Brandywine-creek about 28 miles from Philadelphia.</P>
<P>I got every thing prepared for the voyage before dinner, and in the afternoon I went out to &s;ea, on board the Briti&s;h frigate called the Hind, commanded by Captain Larcom. This fri|gate and an armed brig came round to rai&s;e the Brack f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oop of war, which had been &s;unk &s;ome time before; I then began to form to my&s;elf the de&s;ign of making a diving bell and go down into the ve&s;&s;el, as it appeared to me impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e her: the day before they broke a 13 inch haw&s;er, I went below with the armourer and &s;pent the afternoon with &s;everal of the officers, till night came on. The pilot-boat had left me, and I was afraid I &s;hould have to &s;tay on board till next morning: during this time &s;ome of my acquaintance on &s;hore were du|bious of the commander detaining me, as they &s;aid I would be a u&s;eful man on board: at that time there were two officers on &s;hore, my friends had formed to them&s;elves this idea, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> to keep the officers as ho&s;tages 'till I was re&s;tored. But to my great &s;atisfaction, a pilot-boat belonging to David Hazard, came out to the brig with the two officers, and I returned on &s;hore about eight or nine o'clock, I went home and found my&s;elf very hungry, every thing cleaned away, I went to the hou&s;e of Mr. Elliot with an intention of getting &s;omething to eat and drink, I &s;pent the evening and &s;lept there that night.

we &s;et &s;ail after dinner from Lewi&s;town for Brandywine creek; we arrived on the Thur&s;day following, 20th in&s;tant, before &s;ix o'clock in the morning. I went twice through Wil|mington, (where the Yellow fever was raging) to take the &s;tage or get any other carriage to bring me up to Philadelphia. The fever was as fatal in Wilmington, in proportion to the number of its inhabitants, as it was in Philadelphia&punc; in cro&s;&s;ing Brandywine bridge, I begged a chew of tobacco from a traveller as a preventative&mdash;At this time all intercour&s;e was &s;topt between the two places. I was very anxious to reach Philadelphia about 9 o'clock A.M. and re&s;olved to walk it; the day was as warm as any during the &s;ummer, I took of my coat and carried it over my &s;houlders: on cro&s;&s;ing Brandywine bridge a &s;econd time, I met a Mr. M'Kenzie, he a&s;ked me where I was going. I told him and what for; he told me, that the night before, he was in company with a clerk belonging to one of the banks, who informed the company, that they had got hold of a &s;hallop|man, who took down the river with him, a &s;mith and his ap|prentice; and that the &s;mith had a red pock<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> book full of bank notes. My going down the river with him was true; but as to a pocket book I never carried one. I knew the &s;hallop man I went down with, to be a poor, &s;illy, ignorant creature, and this began to make me afraid there was &s;omething very &s;erious. I bought a bi&s;cuit and three peaches&mdash;at fir&s;t &s;tart I travelled to Che&s;ter, and &s;aw no per&s;on in particular that I knew on the road, until I came to a white-hou&s;e, where there was a number of German pa&s;&s;engers con&s;igned to Gurney &amp; Smith, mer|chants, Philadelphia. I there met a Mr. Curtis, a potter; as &s;oon as he &s;aw me, he told me what I was going to Philadel|phia for; but per&s;uaded me to go back again as they had got the people. Here we had &s;omething to drink, and I eat my bi&s;cuit, which was all the food I eat during my journey. As I had got &s;o far, I thought I would go and &s;how my&s;elf to &s;ome of my acquaintance on the out &s;kirts of the town; I met Squire Wharton, I met al&s;o John Haines, the &s;addler; but did not know that he was a con&s;table till next day. Mr. Curtis pa&s;&s;ed me on hor&s;eback, we met at Derby where we had &s;omething to drink, and as there was a barber in the hou&s;e I got &s;haved, being about 7 miles from Philadelphia. I pro|ceeded to Mr. Stocker's country-hou&s;e &s;ituated in the Iri&s;h track about two miles from Philadelphia, arrived there about 7 o'clock in the evening, very low, owing to the heat of the day, travelling on foot, and the little &s;u&s;tenance I took on the

I begged for &s;ome re|fre&s;hment, but in&s;tead of receiving any, the dome&s;tics began to quarrel about it; I a&s;ked for a drink of water, they would not give me any thing. I knew I could get any refre&s;hment I wan|ted at Lebanon: but had thought they would have taken care of me for one night at Mr. Stocker's; but I was di&s;appointed.

Don't you know me &s;aid I? Is that Lyon? yes, &s;ays I. Who took you? I told him I did not want any ta|king, I came of my own accord; I a&s;ked him what charge there was again&s;t me.

I then begged him to let me &s;leep on his floor, as I was afraid to go into town; owing to the Yellow fever making &s;uch terrible ravages he again replied no. We agreed to meet next morning at 9 o'clock, I then proceeded to Lebanon, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">here I fell in with Me&s;&s;rs.

I then a&s;ked leave to get breakfa&s;t; he told me he would tru&s;t me to get breakfa&s;t, as I had been &s;o honoura|ble as to come 150 miles to &s;urrender my&s;elf. He &s;trongly per|&s;uaded me to go to Germantown, where the Bank was remov|ed; it was too far for me to walk and I was afraid to go into any of their carriages, becau&s;e the &s;ick were frequently in all the common carriages; I held in remembarance my former promi&s;e to meet Mr. Stocker, at nine o'clock, A. M. I breakfa&s;ted with my friend John Saunders, at Lebanon; but was very faint and low, and my joints were become &s;tiff in a great mea&s;ure. I proceeded to the hou&s;e of Mr. Stocker, and arrived there about a quarter pa&s;t nine o'clock; as I entered the gate, he mounted his hor&s;e, and &s;aid, Lyon I will be back directly. While he was gone, Squire Wharton, came to the hou&s;e, Mr. Stocker returned in about two hours afterwards, and brought with him Mr. Fox, the Pre&s;ident of the Bank, Smith the Ca&s;hier: (and Haines, the high con&s;table was &s;lily &s;ent for) at this time I did not know that Haines, the &s;addler had been transformed into a con&s;table. Mr. Stocker, being one of the City Alder|men, opened the examination. They took down in wri|ting all my travels from the time that I left Philadel|phia. Mr. Fox, a&s;ked me if I &s;aw any &s;trangers taking any particular notice of the locks, I an&s;wered no. (I did not when the que&s;tion was a&s;ked, reckon Robin&s;on the car|penter a &s;tranger, as he and his acquaintance came to my &s;hop while the doors were there; nor did I according to the que&s;tion, conceive the other to be a &s;tranger as I had &s;een him with Robin&s;on). However I &s;till held Robin&s;on in &s;u&s;picion, and from the circum&s;tances of a Mr. Brodie, a carpenter, who was hanged at Edinburgh. On this examination before Mr. Stock|er, &amp;c. I related the &s;tory, with the view to &s;how, in what I held Robin&s;on in &s;u&s;picion for robbing the Bank; which was thus delivered, as near as I can recollect, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That in part of the year of 1788 and 1789, I was then on my travels in Scot|land. About this time Mr. Brodie the carpenter, had been tried and condemned to die for robbing the exci&s;e office. Mr.
<PB N="20" REF="035752_0019_100663E5893E41B8">
Brodie's long train of villanies was carried on in the following manner: He employed a va&s;t number of journeymen, and built perhaps a &s;treet at a time: be that as it may, every hou&s;e that he fini&s;hed, he was &s;ure to have fal&s;e keys made for every door in the hou&s;e, until he had a collection of fal&s;e keys that would have filled a large ca&s;k. He had a &s;ecret place &s;ituated without the city, where he kept his fal&s;e keys. The bunch of keys that was made for each hou&s;e, had a tally, and when he wanted to rob any particular hou&s;e, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of &s;uch a bunch of keys, with &s;uch a gentleman's tally. He was a man entru&s;ted very much, and did the government work in his line in that country; and carried on robbery for &s;everal years, till, he was detected robbing the Exci&s;e office. He made the fir&s;t new invented gallows in the North, and was the fir&s;t that &s;wung upon his new invented machine. This circum|&s;tance of Brodie's; connected with others, wrought &s;o much on my mind, (and I knew that Robin&s;on had all the Bank locks in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion), that they appeared to me (whether vi&s;ionary or not), like two parallel lines. During my exa|mination, became very faint, and called for &s;ome water, which was thought an implication of guilt, (here I would wi&s;h to a&s;k the be&s;t informed and mo&s;t experienced of mankind, if an innocent man has not generally more tremor when accu&s;ed, than a guilty per&s;on; who is for the mo&s;t habituated to an emboldened confidence from nature or from cu&s;tom). Smith the Ca&s;hier, began to lay down the manner in which the Bank was robbed, and the two locks that were in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion were opened, and that the cellar door was broke open; at this time I did not know the &s;ituation of the Bank, whether it had a cellar door or not.</P>
<P>The &s;u&s;picions entertained again&s;t me at this time, were as follows, to wit. That I had two iron doors at my &s;hop, with the locks. I knew very well my innocence, and as there was another &s;mith employed in fixing two other doors; I a&s;ked why not &s;u&s;pect him? They an&s;wered me he did his work in half the time. I found I was in the hands of tho&s;e who were not the mo&s;t intelligent of mankind&mdash;rich, but probably connected with Gotham. Mr. Stocker addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, after having had a &s;ecret conver&s;ation with Mr. Fox.&mdash;"Mr. Lyon, I am very &s;orry: but I mu&s;t be under the di&s;a|greeable nece&s;&s;ity of committing you to pri&s;on." I begged of him not to do that: a&s;&s;uring him of my innocence, and ac|companied with all the entreaties I was ma&s;ter of; telling

him if he &s;ent me to pri&s;on, he was not only &s;ending an hone&s;t man there, but the &s;on of an hone&s;t man. But to my grief and &s;orrow, at this moment entreaties were vain, oppo&s;ed to inflexible obduracy. Mr. Stocker told me he had proof again&s;t me; this appeared &s;trange to me, and where the great error lay, my p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">rating eye could not di&s;cover. Mr. Stocker &s;aid, here is Haines <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he con&s;table waiting for you. I &s;ubmitted.&mdash;I knew the Yellow fever had made its appearance, and had its effect (I believe) in pri&s;on. This to me was like fronting the lines of an enemy, expo&s;ed without a po&s;&s;ible means of de|fence; but there is to &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> not to be avoided.</P>
<P>I was then ordered into a chair with Haines the con&s;table, who drove me to pri&s;on. After he had lodged me in the hands of the head goaler, he went home and &s;ickened with the Yellow fever, I my&s;elf never expected to come out alive. I reflected on the hard&s;hip of my fate, but con&s;oled my&s;elf with the idea, that innocence would be &s;hielded by providential om|nipoten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y. When I entered the pri&s;on, there were between twenty or thirty ca&s;es, of that almo&s;t un&s;paring di&s;order. I was put in&s;tantly under clo&s;e confinement. The keeper of the women's wing had charge of me, who&s;e heart was not of the dove kind, but rather in kind, more like to a lap&s;tone. I begged of him to get me &s;ome refre&s;hment. He brought me &s;ome rice &s;oup: it was unwhole&s;ome, being made of old rice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and even at the be&s;t of times, there is not too much nouri&s;h|ment in any of their di&s;hes; but it was more particularly the ca&s;e in regard to me, con&s;idering the low &s;ituation I was in. About this time, I began to be drawn double. I offered the keeper a &s;um of money, (part of the little I had) to get me &s;omething nouri&s;hing; adding that I could not eat the &s;oup. He an&s;wered (not very &s;moothly) if I could not, that I might do without. He then took the &s;oup away, and I was twenty four hours afterwards without a mor&s;el. About this time, the deaths in the city were very numerous; according to report, they exceeded one hundred per day. The room where I was clo&s;ely confined, was in the north we&s;t corner, where I had a view into Sixth-&s;treet; here they kept their potatoes, manufactured &s;hoes, &s;tores, &amp;c. I had about 12 feet by 4 to walk in, the greate&s;t part of my friends were out of town; and tho&s;e that were in town, were afraid to come to the pri|&s;on; as the fever was raging there, and that with a degree of violence, together with the heavy charges exhibited again&s;t me, were &s;ufficient preventatives again&s;t my having the con|&s;olation
<PB N="22" REF="035752_0021_100663EB2BD9D480">
of &s;eeing any of my friends. I &s;ent for a worthy ci|tizen, of the name of William Lace: who vi&s;ited me twice. I told him of my &s;u&s;picions. He begged of me to keep quiet. I told him I could not&mdash;and that if they would let me loo&s;e, I thought from what I had &s;een at Market-&s;treet ferry, I could &s;ift the matter out. Here Mr. Lace took &s;ick with the Yellow fever; and I was fearful I &s;hould never &s;ee him more. About this time, my old keeper died with the Yellow fever, (and I am apt to think did not leave too much humanity behind him), his name was Lewis, profe&s;&s;ing to be a quaker. Some acquaintances occa&s;ionally &s;poke to me at the window&mdash;I wanted &s;omething to eat&mdash;the keepers neglected me &s;ometimes. I had a little money in my pocket; I tried if I could throw a potatoe into the &s;treet, which I did; I called an old acquain|tance to the window, and was about throwing him a dollar to buy me &s;ome meat; he went off telling me he would call again, but I did not &s;ee him 'till I was liberated. Mr. John Saunders, of Lebanon, vi&s;ited me, who procured me &s;ome re|fre&s;hment&mdash;he called a &s;econd time, and returned me my money back, with tears in his eyes, (the mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ive language to &s;hew the fine&s;t feelings of human nature), imploring me ear|ne&s;tly to keep up my &s;pirits under my heavy load, he took leave of me and in a few days after died with the prevailing di&s;order. Thus the humane and good are as liable to the di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, (if not more &s;o), than the crafty, mean, and villainous.</P>
<P>About this time the Bank had &s;ent down to Lewi&s;town, and enquired concerning my travels, and found every thing to be correct, (as related in the fir&s;t part of this work), ex|cept an omi&s;&s;ion of telling them that I was on board of a Briti&s;h frigate, which they got an account of there. Mr. Fox, the Pre&s;ident of the Bank, &s;ent a letter to Mr. Peter Helm, the head gaoler, with a twenty dollar note inclo&s;ed. The &s;ub&s;tance of the letter I under&s;tood from the gaoler as he opened the iron door where I was confined, was thus: He a&s;ked me if I had read the Governor's reward, and the ad|ditional reward of the Bank. I an&s;wered, Yes, I have read both. He then a&s;ked me if I knew any thing concerning the robbery, as the letter &s;ent from Mr. Fox contained a twenty dollar note, to be laid out in nece&s;&s;aries for me, and a de&s;ire to know if I knew any thing of the robbery. I an&s;wered, I knew nothing of the robbery; but that I &s;u&s;pected Robin&s;on the carpenter, who had all the locks in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and as the
<PB N="23" REF="035752_0022_100663ECB19C6C98">
outer and inner doors mu&s;t have been open, before they could get to the vault doors, even allowing the robbery to have been committed by opening the cellar door. I never had the cellar door lock in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, nor the outer or inner door lock, and putting me into pri&s;on on &s;o &s;light a view of the ca&s;e; was as great a cruelty under the exerci&s;e of the law, as perhaps ever was committed on the body of any man. About this time, my friend William Lace was getting over the Yellow fever, which circum&s;tance was a peculiar gratification to me; he had buried one of his children, a regretted lo&s;s no doubt to him&mdash;he vi&s;ited me after his recovery &s;everal times. Haines, the high con&s;table, after &s;taggering through the con&s;equential force of the prevailing malady, vi&s;ited me likewi&s;e&mdash;the head gaolar with him. He a&s;ked me &s;everal que&s;tions; I told him of my innocent, though hard ca&s;e, I likewi&s;e told him that I had rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect certain per&s;ons. By this time he had learnt I &s;u&s;pected Robin&s;on, the carpenter, but I gave him no &s;atisfaction; I told him I had rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect two per&s;ons, and would be glad to get my liberty, as from the &s;ituation I had &s;een tho&s;e two per&s;ons whom I &s;u&s;pected, I would &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t the matter out. I likewi&s;e told him of the inju&s;tice in the Bank, by keeping me under clo&s;e confinement &s;o long; telling him at the &s;ame time, I thought they had taken the wrong method to find out &s;uch a robbery. I then related to him a compari&s;on, which I had read of the &s;uper&s;titious cu&s;toms of old, which is thus, as near as I can recollect. That in the days of yore, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> a per&s;on died, it was &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome writers that the &s;oul does not leave the body immediately, but gradually withdraws as the body cools; during this time, the relatives or friends of the decea&s;ed, &s;ets what is called the pa&s;&s;ing bell to ring; and in tho&s;e days, the people believed the Devil to be the Prince of the air and being fond of mu&s;ic, this bell was rung as they &s;aid, to divert him a&s;ide, &s;o as the &s;oul might pa&s;s up to the milky way without infernal ob&s;truction. Having related to Haines this ancient &s;tory, and &s;aying at the &s;ametime, the people who had committed this daring robbery, had whi&s;pered into the ears of the Bank, that it mu&s;t be this one, or that one, and look that way, or the other way; but don't look <HI>this way:</HI> while they who committed the fact, were &s;nugly hiving their booty. He le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t me, and went I &s;uppo&s;e to the directors of the Bank, who I have not the lea&s;t doubt, had given him every in&s;truction in what manner to proceed. But I found &s;ufficient &s;u&s;picion to believe this vi&s;itor of artifice,
<PB N="24" REF="035752_0023_100663EE53B07378">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be keen for the reward. I was again vi&s;ited by him in a few days after, but at fir&s;t &s;ight I &s;aw (as far as I could judge of appearance) the reward was his object. We entered into a long conver&s;ation. He told me if I could give him any information, &s;o as the bank could get at <HI>&s;ome</HI> of their money, that I &s;hould be entitled to two thou&s;and dollars. I told him it was out of my power, as I was an innocent man, and knew nothing of the affair; but I &s;till had my &s;u&s;picions. He then a&s;ked my &s;u&s;picions. I declined giving him any &s;atisfaction; but &s;aid if they would let me loo&s;e, I thought I could catch the fellows. He told me that the Directors of the Bank had a meeting, and had given up the whole to Mr. Stocker; and that it was left entirely at his plea&s;ure to &s;et me at liberty if he thought proper. This part of Haines' &s;tory appeared rea&s;on|able to me, becau&s;e (as far as I ever under&s;tood) in the old country, they cannot keep a man in pri&s;on on mere &s;u&s;picion exceeding the &s;pace of forty-eight hours, without the liability of the law, (and that liability con&s;equential). He then a&s;ked me if I would tell my &s;u&s;picions to Mr. Stocker. I told him as it was left to Mr. Stocker to liberate me, I would not tell my &s;u&s;picions 'till I got my liberty, and then I &s;hould have a better opportunity of &s;ifting into my &s;u&s;picions before I would pro|ceed. Shaking me by the hand, he delivered me a me&s;&s;age from Mr. Stocker, that I &s;hould &s;till think him (Mr. Stocker) my friend. I told him it was impo&s;&s;ible for me, con&s;idering every circum&s;tance, to think him my friend, after the &s;evere treatment I had experienced through his means; as he certainly mu&s;t have known or &s;ugge&s;ted to him&s;elf that I was innocent of the charge. I told Haines that there were many innocent men condemned in pri&s;on; he &s;aid he believed it to be true, as it is common here (meaning the pri&s;on) to puni&s;h the innocent for the guily. I told him that &s;uch a di&s;regard to ju&s;tice would, or might certainly have an effect to cau&s;e a revolution in this country, and drew &s;everal inferential remarks relative to the ba&s;tile of Paris.</P>
<P>I was frequently vi&s;ited by the convicts, who pa&s;&s;ed occa|&s;ionally by my room door, and among&s;t tho&s;e I mu&s;t parti|cularize a certain John Sheaffer, who had a brother confined on account of the late robbery of the Bank; he a&s;ked me &s;everal que&s;tions, &s;uch as, where I was at the time the rob|bery was committed, &amp;c. and giving him a full account, &amp;c. the reward being great, and he to gain his liberty; laid one of the deepe&s;t and mo&s;t machinating &s;chemes that could be

capable of villainy, ever heard of, for the &s;ake (of what I &s;uppo&s;e) a reward.</P>
<P>Under this long &s;olitary confinement, I wanted books (dive&s;t|ed of any other amu&s;ement), to pa&s;s away my time; I at length got the Bible and Robert Burn's Scotch poems, which made my library as complete as was in my power to collect. I read until I was tired, and walked till I was weary, every day expecting that my relea&s;ement would come; and although I am, and have been, very much given to profe&s;&s;ional &s;tudy, I could not &s;tudy the grand &s;cience which I have made &s;o much progre&s;s in, (con&s;idering my age,) embracing every opportunity to do &s;o. If I attempted to pa&s;s away my time in natural mu&s;ical harmony, (<HI>i. e.</HI> whi&s;tling and &s;inging), I was ordered to a dungeon. If I &s;poke to any per&s;on at the window, I was to be &s;ent to the cells (or a dungeon), this I thought very hard, for to &s;uffer in the manner I did, before a trial commenced, (or a cau&s;e for trial); the u&s;age I received was wor&s;e than any pri&s;oner, either convicted or tho&s;e for trial, as we all &s;uffered our confinement, with this difference&mdash;the convicts had a large yard to walk in, while I was lingering by my&s;elf, on &s;u&s;picion only; and at this period no per&s;on admitted to hear the &s;orrowful breathings of truth, which emanating from innocence, might have had a &s;ympathetic effect. Every hour expecting to hear of the di&s;covery of the robbery, I frequently prayed in the mo&s;t fervent manner (when it appeared to me that the robbery was like to be for ever concealed), that the Great Creator might confu&s;e tho&s;e who had the money, &s;o as the whole might be brought to light&mdash;to liberate the innocent, and bring to condign puni&s;hment the perpetrators of the deed, for the commi&s;&s;ion of which I was &s;uffering. My brea&s;t was now &s;welled con&s;iderably, and I was drawn almo&s;t double, my hair fell from my head as I walked in the room. At this moment I could not help taking a retro&s;pect of the pa&s;t, reflectively con&s;idering my former &s;ituation in life, being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hou&s;e full of furniture, which co&s;t me be|tween three and four hundred pounds; having three capital beds, and to &s;leep on the hard boards every night, was a &s;olemn and &s;erious change. After I had &s;uffered five weeks or up|wards, in this mi&s;erable and forlorn &s;ituation; Haines the con|&s;table came to the pri&s;on with a hor&s;e and chair, and told me Mr. Stocker would be glad to &s;ee me. I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf as well as circum&s;tances would admit, and went before Mr. Stock|er, with a long beard, which a razor had not touched &s;ince

the time I came through Derby. Mr. Stocker &s;aid he was glad to &s;ee me. I told him I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> is very &s;orry to &s;ee him, owing to the wretchedne&s;s of my &s;ituation, and began to a&s;k him what could be his meaning for &s;ending me to pri&s;on; to this que&s;tion he gave me no &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. After expo&s;tulat|ing with him for &s;ome time, Mr. Fox, the Pre&s;ident of the Bank came. No &s;ooner did he enter the room than Mr. Stocker and him&s;elf, (the Pre&s;ident), began to talk about &s;ome great dinner, (I thought that human mi&s;ery might have com|manded a little more re&s;pect), and Mr. Stocker ob&s;erved he was very &s;orry that he lo&s;t &s;o good a dinner&mdash;this dinner was at Germantown.</P>
<P>Let the reader con&s;ider within him&s;elf my mi&s;erable &s;ituation, ju&s;t brought out of a loath&s;ome and unwhol&s;ome pri&s;on, and to hear two men unfeelingly trumpeting to each other in common though exulting language, the glorious gormandizing that had taken place on &s;uch a day at Germantown. I ob&s;erved, (or thought I ob&s;erved) or &s;aw by this time, Mr. Fox was but a young man in every &s;en&s;e of the word, as to his experience in the world. We had a long conver&s;ation on the art of lock-making, but I could not extract from them the lea&s;t informa|tion by what means or manner the inner hall door of the Bank was opened; this &s;eemed to put the whole congregation to a nonplus, with regard to my ca&s;e, this point only ought to have been &s;ufficient to have cleared me, and I believe in the real opinion of the whole it did&mdash;but &s;ay they, you are an in|genious man, and <HI>could do &s;uch a thing.</HI> After all my trouble and vexation, I found I had to deal with men who were rather more ob&s;tinate and per&s;i&s;ting than experienced, and I was &s;uf|fering, and had &s;uffered from that cau&s;e. I was then a&s;ked for my &s;u&s;picions. Mr. Stocker got pen, ink and paper, and took down the following words, as near as I can recollect, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That on the Friday afternoon, or the day after the iron doors came to my &s;hop, Robin&s;on the carpenter, came to my &s;hop with a &s;tranger, they both examined the locks very clo&s;ely; Robin&s;on gave me &s;trict orders to go on as quick as po&s;&s;ible, I told him in the hearing of the &s;tranger that the locks were not fit for a bank. Robin&s;on's an&s;wer was, Damn it, it will make a &s;hift. I gave Robin&s;on and his companion &s;omething to drink, and they both went towards Second-&s;treet. In about five or ten minutes after, Robin&s;on's companion came back and went into the &s;hop, while I was an&s;wering a young wo|man at the door. Robin&s;on's companion did not &s;top one
<PB N="27" REF="035752_0026_100663F60E4F8360">
minute&mdash;as he came out of the &s;hop, I &s;aid to him, I believe I mu&s;t work all night, the Bank is in &s;uch a hurry for their work. Robin&s;on's companion an&s;wered, and &s;aid, he would &s;ee the Bank damn'd before he would kill him&s;elf for them; he then went towards Front-&s;treet&punc; While I was hanging the doors at the Bank, I &s;aw this companion of Robin&s;on's there; but I could not tell what he was, I had never &s;een him 'till within tho&s;e two days&mdash;Robin&s;on's companion appeared to me to be a clerk, (I &s;uppo&s;e in the Land-office), as Carpenter's hall had been occupied by the Land-office, prior to the remo|val of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania&mdash;Robin&s;on's companion &s;eemed to me to be well acquainted with the whole of the Banking hou&s;e. I afterwards, about the 20th or 22d of Augu&s;t, &s;aw Robin&s;on and his companion at Market-&s;treet ferry: ju&s;t as I turn'd round from Market-&s;treet, they were both &s;itting at the front window, and I declare, I never &s;aw two men &s;o alarmed as they were at the &s;ight of me, they &s;tared and looked con|fu&s;ed at one another; I &s;aw they were alarmed at my appear|ance, therefore I did not go near them; but they ob&s;erved I &s;aw the confu&s;ion of their countenances. Robin&s;on called me to the window&mdash;they were drinking either porter or beer &s;an|garee, but did not a&s;k me to drink. Robin&s;on &s;ays to me, Mr. Lyon what brought you this way, are you not afraid? the Yellow fever broke out here. I an&s;wered, what brought you this way, are you not afraid? Mr. Lyon, &s;ays Robin&s;on, do you mean to go out of town? I do not know, &s;ays I&mdash;Do you mean to go out of town? he an&s;wered, he did not know. Says Robin|&s;on, Mr. Lyon there is a bar wanting for a door of the Bank, mentioning what door; but I do not recollect what door it was he mentioned. His companion replied, Damn it, there will be no occa&s;ion for that. I an&s;wered them, I was ready for them at all times; however I &s;aw by their countenances they wanted to get rid of my company; I left them, and went to a peach boat and bought &s;ome peaches; carried them to my &s;hop, and gave my apprentice &s;ome of them. I &s;aid to my apprentice, Jeamie I &s;aw Robin&s;on and that &s;tranger, at Market-&s;treet ferry, that was in our &s;hop while we were doing the iron doors; they &s;eemed to be in deep &s;tudy, and I do not think they are after any good. Having delivered tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions, and Mr. Stocker having taken down the whole in writing; I a&s;ked him if it had any effect, will you give me the reward. Both Mr. Stocker and Mr. Fox, &s;aid it was good for nothing. I then demanded my liberty, from what Haines
<PB N="28" REF="035752_0027_100663F814A10D38">
had related to me in pri&s;on, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That the directors of the Bank had, had a meeting, and left it in the power of Mr. Stocker to do as he thought proper&mdash;which information I communicated to Mr. Stocker. Mr. Stocker told me it was no &s;uch thing, and that it was out of his power to di&s;charge me. I then called Haines, who was out of doors, to relate what he &s;aid to me in pri&s;on. He &s;eemed not to under&s;tand me. Says I to Haines, did you not tell me in pri&s;on, that the Directors of the Bank had empowered Mr. Stocker to liberate me, after I had delivered my &s;u&s;picions? Haines with all the a&s;&s;urance properly belonging to the profe&s;&s;ion he now follows, (and as if he had been long hacknied in the profe&s;&s;ion), flatly denied the whole. Mr. Fox a&s;ked me why I mentioned Ro|bin&s;on's name &s;o often. I an&s;wered becau&s;e I did not know his companion's name. I perceived by this time the partiality of Mr. Fox towards Robin&s;on; he would not believe that Robin&s;on ever made u&s;e of an oath&punc; I have heard Robin&s;on &s;wear, and have &s;een him get as drunk as any other man, but Mr. Fox would not believe this. Previous to the Yellow fever I had heard a very mean character of Robin&s;on, in &s;everal re&s;|pects, which &s;trengthened my &s;u&s;picion, after I had heard of the robbery of the Bank. I a&s;ked Mr. Stocker in what man|ner I &s;hould get out of pri&s;on. He told me it was out of his power to do any thing for me, as he was an Alderman when he committed me, but &s;ince cho&s;en one of the A&s;&s;embly, of cour&s;e he was obliged to relinqui&s;h the former. I told him it was cruel in him to &s;erve me &s;o, and who was his prompter I could not tell; but certainly there was &s;ome per&s;on in the Bank who owed me &s;ome private animo&s;ity; and ob&s;erved likewi&s;e to him, that there were men in that Bank, who &s;et up the empty preten&s;ions of being gentlemen, that I would not go over the thre&s;hold of a door to do them a &s;ervice, owing to their meane&s;s; and telling him at the &s;ame time not to ca&s;t any reflections on any other nation, for I plainly &s;ee, &s;aid I, when power falls into the hands of the Americans they were not always more humane than other nations. Said I, would it not have been much better for you to have taken and hung me at once. Mr. Stocker an&s;wered, Mr. Lyon if we have done wrong, there is the law open for you. Sir, &s;aid I, in what manner mu&s;t I act to get out of pri&s;on. He told me I mu&s;t hire a lawyer, (whether I had money or not I &s;upppo&s;e), and be removed by habeas corpus before any of the Judges, and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t out on bail. But, Sir, &s;ays I, the bail you a&s;ked of me

on my fir&s;t examination was 150,000 dollars, which was, and is out of my power to command. But probably the bail, &s;aid he, will be lowered. The Yellow fever was now exten&s;ively &s;preading, and &s;weeping all before it in the pri&s;on, which af|fected me much; but Mr. Stocker told me, that if the affair was found out, and if I was clear, all my lo&s;&s;es &s;hould certainly be made up to me. He told me he had &s;ent me twenty dol|lars for my relief. I thanked him&mdash;Mr. Fox entered the room after having had a long private conver&s;ation with Haines, the &s;uppo&s;ed agent of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania; &s;ays he, Mr. Lyon are there any &s;uch things as dubbs to be bought at the ironmongers. Dubbs, Sir, &s;aid I, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> don't know what you mean. Why (&s;ays he) keys ready cut, with the wards complete, and fit to open any lock. I told him I did not think there were any &s;uch to be bought. Well, &s;ays Mr. Fox, I &s;ent you twenty dollars for your relief, in ca&s;e you wanted any thing. I thanked him. I thought Mr. Stocker's twenty dol|lars, and the twenty dollars from Mr. Fox, which made forty dollars, would keep me pretty comfortable for &s;ome time. I begged of them to tell the gaoler to u&s;e me well, as I thought for the la&s;t fortnight, I had been roughly treated; they both declared it was not their orders. After laying every circum|&s;tance down, that they had no right to &s;u&s;pect me, Mr. Fox a&s;ked me if I knew one Boyd a bricklayer; I told him I did not, but had heard of him. He then a&s;ked me who I thought could do &s;uch a job, as making fal&s;e keys; I mentioned &s;eve|ral, among&s;t the re&s;t was my brother James. Mr. Stocker told me there would be a meeting of the Directors, and that he would do all in his power to modify them, and (&s;ays he) if you are found to be an innocent man, all your lo&s;&s;es &s;hall be made good to you again. I told him it was impo&s;&s;ible for them ever to make my lo&s;s good, for it is ea&s;y (&s;ays I), to take away the good name of a man, but not a very ea&s;y matter to re-e&s;tabli&s;h that name, &s;o taken away; I have (I ob&s;erved to him) acted as a gentleman &s;ince I was put in pri&s;on; but I now found my temper could no longer be re&s;trained, and told him never more to expect a civil an&s;wer from me. I was then ordered back to clo&s;e confinement. I went into the chair along with Haines, who I began to con&s;ider as a &s;peculator on hu|man wretchedne&s;s. I prevailed on him to drive me into Third-&s;treet, as I wanted to &s;peak to Captain Guy, which he con|&s;ented to. As Captain Guy was well acquainted with the gaoler, I told him to &s;tep forward and &s;peak to the keeper,
<PB N="30" REF="035752_0029_100663FD72B89E80">
and prevail upon him to u&s;e better treatment towards me, which he did the next day; the gaoler then a&s;ked my complaint, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> delivered to him, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That I was in want of many nece&s;&s;aries, and for a fortnight no per&s;on ad|mitted to &s;ee me. The gaoler told me that orders were given, and he could not help it, and that he expected another ru&s;h from the pri&s;oners. I told him if he apprehended any danger, open the door of my room and I will defend you as far as lies in my power. The city as I rode through had a di&s;mal, deadly, and dreadful appearance&mdash;no vehicle to be &s;een but tho&s;e &s;oul &s;triking carriages, adapted for the conveyance of the dying and the dead. After I was re-conveyed to my old habitation, and there again fixed, I begged as a kindne&s;s that a friend might be permitted to bring me &s;ome paper, that I might have the plea&s;ure of writing to &s;ome of my friends, and to &s;ee if any of them would bail me out&mdash;which was procured. I wrote a letter fir&s;t to Mr. Stocker, pointing out to him the impropriety of keeping me in pri&s;on, likewi&s;e laying down the crippled &s;ituation of the Bank in regard to it's &s;ecurity again&s;t robbery, and that as I had warned them of danger almo&s;t twelve months prior to their la&s;t misfortune, and they would not li&s;ten to me; it appeared to me there was a veil over their eyes, &s;o as to hinder them from &s;eeing clearly, and that their locks were on the barn door principle. After clo&s;ing this letter I do not know from what impul&s;e, (but it might be from a fooli&s;h one or otherwi&s;e, but it was a &s;udden one), I directed this letter in the following manner, to wit. John C. Stocker, E&s;quire, from the Honourable Patrick Lyon, now in Philadelphia pri&s;on. This letter, the contents of which unfolded the unguarded &s;tupidity of their &s;ecurity for &s;uch ex|ten&s;ive property, and &s;uch a bold direction to one of the State Legi&s;lators, (who perhaps might think him&s;elf one of the Lord's annointed), had &s;uch a powerful effect, that it rai&s;ed a fer|ment or a flame throughout the whole Bank, and they all can|didly declared, (and I give them credit for their candour in this particular), that they would &s;tretch every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">don to bring me to puni&s;hment, (the view of ju&s;tice I pre&s;ume was then ob|&s;cured by the interference of prejudice). There is not a doubt but writing the truth might gall the &s;orene&s;s of &s;ome of their half healed wounds, but truth being my mi&s;tre&s;s. I follow her dictates, and penned what I did; and what I did write I defy any or either of them to prove to the contrary, (I mean in the body of the letter, but leave the &s;uper&s;cription out of
<PB N="31" REF="035752_0030_100663FF07C37128">
the que&s;tion, as a mere matter of inanity). I wrote letters to &s;everal of my friends to &s;tep forward in my behalf; and one of them I cannot help remarking on&mdash;I had formerly put (with entire confidence in him) into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, all the mo|ney I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and had &s;uch a particular confidence of his integrity that I did not require a receipt; he &s;ent me an an|&s;wer to the following purport, that he would not bail me for a five penny bit, (or what is commonly termed a fip-penny bit). I reflected on mankind, and thought at that trying period of time, the &s;in af ingratitude was the &s;uperlative crime of nature&mdash;but I leave the wretch to his own feelings. At that identical time I had not one friend left in the city but William Lace, who publicly declared that he would abide by me, (as he thought I was wrong'd), to the la&s;t; he was not afraid of any con&s;equences, as he was well convinced of my innocence&mdash;that man (William Lace), I believe, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;oul of an independent and hone&s;t being, and is worthy of his creator; he frequently vi&s;ited me at the ri&s;que of his life, while the Yellow fever was ravaging nearly indi&s;criminately in all parts of the city, but more particularly in every quarter of the pri&s;on. Lawyer Ro&s;s vi&s;ited me, I &s;tated my ca&s;e to him, he imagined as the robbery had been &s;o long dormant, it would not be found out; and he ob&s;erved that many men from circum&s;tances appertaining to the law, were puni&s;hed though innocent, that I was &s;o &s;ituated as not to hope (for the pre&s;ent), any mitigation of cour&s;e. I got &s;haved by this time, and was removed by habeas corpus before Judge Shippen, who was &s;itting about three miles from town; my worthy friend Mr. Lace procured two hor&s;es and chairs, and gave a lawyer a fee. I &s;et out accompanied with the head gaoler, Mr. Lace, and Mr. Lace's &s;on; we came to Judge Shippen's re&s;idence. I laid down to the lawyer employ'd, the whole circum&s;tance, and particularly in what manner the outer and inner door could be opened, as tho&s;e locks were never in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and that tho&s;e doors mu&s;t have been opened, before they could get at the vault door. However after all my trouble in relating every point, which I thought would have &s;o operated, as to cau&s;e my di&s;charge&mdash;I found my&s;elf di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>We came before the Judge, and after waiting &s;ome time, Mr. Fox and his attorney, Mr. Rawle, came. The appear|ance of Mr. Rawle to me (although he was retained again&s;t me), I was much plea&s;ed with, for I dearly love to &s;ee a

good and ingenious workman in any profe&s;&s;ion; the charge was then opened, and Mr. Fox being &s;worn, he went on as near as I can recolect, thus, <ABBR>viz</ABBR> That the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Bank was removed to Carpenter's-Hall, that two iron doors from the old Bank of the book vault, were &s;ent to Mr. Lyon's &s;hop, to have the hinges, and locks removed, &amp;c. The doors were &s;ent &s;ome where about the 9th or 10th of Au|gu&s;t, but to a certainty it was on a Thur&s;day; &s;everal me&s;|&s;ages were &s;ent to Mr. Lyon, to make as great &s;peed as po&s;&s;i|ble, with the doors, and that Mr. Lyon was told that the doors were for the ca&s;h vault. That another &s;mith was em|ployed to hang the doors of the other vault and that the other &s;mith did his work in a much &s;horter time; that he (mea|ning my&s;elf), &s;aid on his fir&s;t examination, he did &s;ome work for Mr. Stocker during the time, that tho&s;e doors were in his pofe&s;&s;ion, and he &s;aid the Locks that were on tho&s;e doors were not worth a damn for a Bank; that his delay with the doors appeared &s;u&s;picious, as the Bank had been robbed. That the in&s;ide door was hung fir&s;t on the Saturday following, that he did nothing on the out&s;ide door till Monday, that he (Ly|on), was known to work late the Saturday night when he had tho&s;e doors in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. That he has endeavoured to &s;u&s;pect a Mr. Robin&s;on, and another gentleman. Here it is nece&s;&s;ary to pau&s;e a little to enquire who this &s;aid gentleman was, whom Mr. Fox had &s;uch an unlimitted confidence in, and of his in|tegrity likewi&s;e; who was this &s;aid gentleman but I&s;aac Davis, the jaunting companion (&s;ometimes) of Smith the Ca&s;hier, or information belies &s;uch jaunting. The &s;ame Davis who was courting a relation, (if not a &s;i&s;ter), of the wife of the &s;aid Smith; it would have been cruel indeed to have &s;u&s;pected &s;o amiable, &s;o friendly, and &s;o good a character, as this I&s;aac Davis (alias the gentleman) was. (That is, Robin&s;on and the GENTLEMAN), as &s;oon as they heard they were &s;u&s;pected, came forward and gave a very good and &s;atisfactory account of them&s;elves, and where they were the time the robbery was committed; that he (Lyon), told Mr. Haines the high con&s;ta|ble he would not tell his &s;u&s;picions until he got his liberty; that on his &s;econd examination he &s;aid the in&s;ide lock, was a good one, that having tho&s;e locks in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion we were jealous of him making fal&s;e keys, as he is a good workman in that line which jealou&s;y hindered him from doing our work in future, or having any acquaintance in (or of), the Banks&punc;
<PB N="33" REF="035752_0032_10066403AB65A268">
Mr. Rawle then read the paper, that Mr. Stocker wrote <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my &s;econd examination, with Robin&s;on's name, but I did not know the name of the gentleman, who I &s;aw drinking with him at Market-&s;treet ferry; but I told Mr. Stocker to &s;end for Robin&s;on, and clo&s;e examine him; then a&s;k him who was drink|ing with him, &s;ays I, the man who was along with Robin&s;on at Market-&s;treet ferry, is the per&s;on I mean, and whom I &s;u&s;pect to have robbed the Bank. He (Mr. Rawle), then read the letter or paper that I wrote to Mr. Stocker, with the curious direction (as aforementioned), and that he was at Lewi&s;town the time the robbery was committed, we are &s;ure of; and the account of his travail throughout we are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which is allowed to be true and ju&s;t, but &s;till he is an ingenious man, and what Mr. Smith, the Ca&s;hier, has repre&s;ented to me ap|pears &s;u&s;picious; his proving an alibi is to be &s;ure in his fa|vour. Judge Shippen then a&s;ked the following que&s;tions, to wit. Mr. Fox have you ever had a former acquaintance with Mr. Lyon? Mr. Fox an&s;wered, I had often heard of him; he has made me a &s;moke-jack for the u&s;e of my hou&s;e, which an&s;wered very well, and he did the work of the Bank before I was elected Pre&s;ident; the fir&s;t job he did for the Bank under my direction, was his opening an iron che&s;t, and I had always heard an hone&s;t charactor of him: he was recommen|ded to the Bank by Mr. Stocker, in particular, and many others. Mr. Judge Shippen then ob&s;erved that from what Mr. Fox had related to him, the &s;u&s;picion appeared well grounded and he could not take upon him&s;elf the power of di&s;charg|ing me: therefore it would be proper to hold me to bail. My lawyer, then began to enquire after the bail; and for what &s;um. The ground work, placed in his hands by me was totally neglected; which (I &s;urmi&s;e) had it been properly handled in a true workman like manner, might have complete|ly operated for my di&s;charge. I &s;tood and heard a farce of unfounded (not to &s;ay &s;tupid and groundle&s;s), &s;u&s;picions, non|&s;en&s;ically put together; fit only for the meridian of a tea-table; that (as far as I am able to judge) &s;cientific men would have thought a mere bagatelle, and an in&s;ult upon their under|&s;tandings. I then a&s;ked Mr. Fox in what manner the inner door was opened; allowing the robbery to have been committed from the cellar door. For the inner door lock was never in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Mr. Fox then began to <HI>&s;uppo&s;e,</HI> that &s;ome per&s;on was concealed in the body of the Bank. I then a&s;ked Mr. Fox who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the keys of the vault? he an&s;wered,
<PB N="34" REF="035752_0033_10066406858E9B80">
Mr. Smith the Ca&s;hier. I told Mr. Fox that neither of the locks were fit for the &s;ecurity of a Bank (I &s;poke as far as my profe&s;&s;ional knowledge led me to &s;ugge&s;t). I told him like|wi&s;e, that I would not tru&s;t a bag full of King George the &s;e|cond's farthings under the &s;ecurity of &s;uch locks. After &s;everal ob&s;ervations on the different methods of Bank work. I told them (that as a profe&s;&s;ional man), I knew more about &s;uch work, than the whole of them combined, and put together. Mr. Rawle replied; from that very cau&s;e we have got hold of you; as you are from every report (and what does a lawyer know, or plead on, but from report), an ingenious workman. I was then held to a bail of &s;ix thou&s;and dollars. Mr. Helm, the head goaler then &s;tept forward, and &s;aid, <HI>Sheaffer</HI> had &s;ome|thing concerning the bu&s;ine&s;s to come forward with. I was then ordered back to pri&s;on, in expectation of getting bail. The bail being lowered to &s;ix thou&s;and dollars; I thought it would not cau&s;e me much trouble to rai&s;e a bail of &s;ix thou&s;and dollars. In this predicament, I &s;ent word to all that I &s;uppo|&s;ed my friends; but every one of tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed friends, re|linqui&s;hed the idea of &s;erving me: becau&s;e I was innocent, and unfortunate. Likewi&s;e public confidence (as far as related to me), being greatly dimini&s;hed by the injurious (and I think I am warranted to &s;ay unju&s;t) repre&s;entations of the Bank. The only &s;taunch friend (even in this trying &s;ituation) was Mr. Wil|liam Lace. I was replaced in my former comfortable abode: (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> clo&s;e confinement). Con&s;idering to my&s;elf, how I was placed, was a double &s;everity of mind, and feeling. I looked and judged of my&s;elf, as a &s;tranger in a free and liberal coun|try. I knew nothing of the &s;y&s;tematic plan, (or I might, if impa&s;&s;ioned call it villainy), that had been repre&s;ented again&s;t me. The robbery was &s;till immured under the murky veil of darkne&s;s, impo&s;&s;ible at that pre&s;ent moment to be brought forward to the lucid glare of day. Situated as I was, and not a per&s;on ab&s;olutely coming to my relief, I thought (and felt), that it was the harde&s;t trial any man's mind and con&s;titution could undergo. The bail was now reduced from 150,000 dollars to 6,000 dollars, which former &s;um was demanded (or exacted) by Mr. Stocker; I now thought it was out of my power to rai&s;e even, 6,000 dollars; my mind (&s;uppo&s;ing I mu&s;t bear the hard|&s;hip of fate re&s;ting on my &s;houlders, and a heavy burthen indeed it was), was quiet and ea&s;y. I here at this time found I had but one friend who was in town, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Mr. William Lace. It may be nece&s;&s;ary at the peculiar and thoughtful moment

which then occurred, to &s;tate (as it was then a ju&s;t idea) the view of my worldly concerns, to wit. When I left Philadelphia to e&s;cape the probable fatal effects of the Yellow fever, (not the Bank robbery), I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the following&mdash;I had a hou&s;e full of furniture, every thing as complete as a per&s;on in my cir|cum&s;tances would wi&s;h, and which co&s;t me between three and four hundred pounds; my winter wood was laid in; a &s;mart young fellow for an apprentice, who&s;e lo&s;s I mo&s;t &s;incerely regret; I then had and now po&s;&s;e&s;s, (after all my hard&s;hips and &s;ufferings) a &s;hop full of tools, that I do not believe there is &s;uch in America, I am certain there is not &s;uch a collection in Philadelphia; I had likewi&s;e 1400 dollars in the Bank of North America; the fir&s;t depo&s;it was on the 17th of April, 1797, con&s;i&s;ting of 860 dollars; the &s;econd depo&s;it, November 3d 1797, of 220 dollars; the third depo&s;it was on the 14th Augu&s;t, 1798, of 410 dollars, and the checks I drew on &s;aid Bank amounted to 90 dollars, which left a balance in my favour of 1400 dollars.

<P>There was a Mr. Murray came to the window of my pri&s;on, to &s;peak with me; I was then (I &s;uppo&s;e from that circum|&s;tance), ordered into a dungeon, but after &s;ome debate in the grand divan, I was excu&s;ed by the head gaoler, under the po|&s;itive promi&s;e never more (while a pri&s;oner, &s;uppo&s;e), to &s;peak to any one at the window.

I thought &s;ome per&s;ons un|known to me, had formed and accompli&s;hed a de&s;ign, and that villainou&s;ly, for the &s;ake of the reward to &s;wear again&s;t me. He &s;hook his head at me, which I under&s;tood, as a &s;ignal that I was gone, which brought me to an ejaculation, and to my bended knees.</P>
<P>About this time, I found my&s;elf rather &s;ickly; I begged for a little wine, but I could not get it. I was examined by the head gaoler, who was a good judge (at this time), of the Yellow fever, and he declared me out of danger. The weather now became extremely cold, and the coldne&s;s of the weather made me &s;hiver and tremble. The convicts (generally &s;peaking), had fires, or a fire in their re&s;pective work&s;hops. Richard Guy got up one morning, when the fro&s;t &s;et in, and

&s;ound him&s;elf very cold. I wonder, &s;aid he, (whether to him|&s;elf or not, is left to the world), if they have allowed poor Lyon any fire, who is confined in a damp room of a pri&s;on. He came to the pri&s;on, and enquired, and found that I was not overheated within the walls of a cold, damp, unwhol&s;ome, loath&s;ome, and &s;olitary pri&s;on. He reprimanded the conduct of the conductors of the pri&s;on towards me, and as they would not wi&s;h to be guilty of the &s;in to blu&s;h for &s;hame; they con&s;cien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ou&s;ly cau&s;ed a fire to be kindled for the advantage, and comfort my &s;uffering con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The long confinement I had experienced, and the hard u&s;age I had received, forced me to a conjecture that there was certainly &s;ome &s;ecret enemy &s;aying clo&s;ely in wait, for the deprivation of all human faculties, (my life), and the &s;ooner &s;hortened the better; but my heart was good and firm: I knew and felt my inno|cence, and that was my grand, great, and &s;ub&s;tantial &s;upport. On the la&s;t day of the month of October, a di&s;covery was made in the pri&s;on, of a con&s;piracy again&s;t me, (and that con|&s;piracy of the mo&s;t black, dark, and malignant that human nature could, or might have &s;ugge&s;ted, cau&s;ed, or formed, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That when Sheaffer, (who may be in the eye of the law a very re&s;pectable character), and a doctor, whether a di&s;ciple of Sangrado or not is out of my power to tell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, but both were criminals, and they acting (to wit, Sheaffer and the doctor) in conjunction and joined by a certain captain Phelphs, (a trio of infernals fit for Hell.) Tho&s;e three worthy gentlemen (though accident might make them criminals), had formed the plot as aforementioned for a con&s;iderable time, until it was di&s;covered by &s;ome of their fellow convicts in pri&s;on. The doctor came forward and confe&s;&s;ed the whole to Mr. Helm, the head jaoler; after he had laid down to Mr. Helm this piece of villainy openly, he then came to the room where I was under confinement, and then and there told me, that John Sheaffer was the planner of the whole &s;cheme, and that he employed a certain captain Phelps to embark in the bu&s;ine&s;s for what purpo&s;e I know not. Soon after this, Sheaffer came to the room where I was and brought another convict with him (to be a &s;econd clau&s;e and bribed witne&s;s I &s;uppo&s;e). He then addre&s;&s;ed me as far as I can recollect, in the following words. Sir, that wicked doctor, I find, has been telling Mr. Helm a parcel of lies; I never had any conver&s;ation with Mr. Smith re&s;pecting you, no farther than I told him you was an inno|cent man. Our bu&s;ine&s;s was about &s;ome forged checks: (the
<PB N="39" REF="035752_0038_100664110FFFB018">
Ca&s;hier I &s;uppo&s;e) might enter into a collateral conver&s;ation in regard to the checks. The doctor had given me a pret|ty good idea of proceedings before, and what Sheaffer now told me, &s;eem'd to me to have &s;uch a corre&s;ponding effect on my mind, that I an&s;wered Sheaffer in this manner, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> (It might be improper or impa&s;&s;ioned, You, and Mr. Smith may both go to hell. You are right my friend &s;aid Sheaffer, and marched off. In a few hours after the head gaoler came into my room, and &s;aid there are fre&s;h orders. What are they, &s;aid I. You mu&s;t go into the ea&s;t-wing of the pri&s;on; I an&s;wered, "Thy will be done." There is another pri&s;oner coming here, &s;aid he. Pray, Sir, (quoth I), what is his crime? On account, (he re|plied) of the Bank. Well, Sir, &s;ays I, I hope you have got the right one, for my &s;ufferings have been, and are now very great. I was then conducted into the ea&s;t-wing, where common thieves and vagrants remain for trial; all the different apartments were wet, owing to &s;crubbing the rooms to clean&s;e the infection from that part of the pri&s;on, where the Yellow fever with that malignity peculiar to it&s;elf, had been ravaging and laying wa&s;te every thing before it; I was put into the room No. 12, where I found two more unfortunates encaged for the &s;ame crime, I was my&s;elf; we were now allowed &s;ome wood to make a fire to dry the rooms, &amp;c. and towards night, I &s;at down in company with about eight or ten pri&s;oners, in this ble&s;&s;ed and beautified place for different crimes, and &s;ome of the company that compo&s;|ed a part of the aggregate, appeared to me the mo&s;t de&s;perate men I ever &s;aw. One in particular entertained, (if an innocent man could think it &s;o, the company with a compendious hi&s;tory of part of his life, and introduced triumpthantly a long train of villanies: in &s;hort, I conceived he was the wickede&s;t man I ever &s;aw, (or ever wi&s;h to &s;ee.

ob&s;ervation had &s;uch a wonderful effect upon my un&s;ought for companion, that it &s;oftened the wickedne&s;s of his heart &s;o much, he in&s;tantaneou&s;ly jumped up, and found me a pillo; &s;aying, my friend, this is not a &s;it place for you. Next day the pri|&s;oners formed them&s;elves into different companies, the gen|teele&s;t part of them, (if any could be properly termed genteel) took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of No. 9, and &s;trongly invited me there; But being a mere uncultivated &s;tranger, it was &s;ome time before I would con&s;ent to be linked with this genteel, or gentleman-like &s;ociety or company; at la&s;t I agreed. There were none admitted in this grand company, but tho&s;e on &s;u&s;picion of no|ble and great crimes, &s;uch as for in&s;tance, forgery, <HI>robbing Banks,</HI> &amp;c. The pri&s;oners for trial were removed from Mor|ris's building. They now introduced another pri&s;oner on &s;u&s;|picion of robbing the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania; he was admitted into our room. There being on his admi&s;&s;ion, four of us con|fined at the &s;ame time, for the &s;ame charge; but to confine, deprive men of liberty, de&s;troy character, wantonly, with a nu|merous variety of et ceteras, on mere paltry, and vague innu|endos or &s;u&s;picions, is a cruelty perhaps not &s;anctioned in any other country but this, which &s;hould be the grand emporium of liberty: My&s;elf confined on &s;u&s;picion of ma|king fal&s;e keys: Two others found in a tavern, for playing at cards for a dollar per game: And a young lad for having the plea&s;ing misfortune of being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a fifty dollar note, on the Bank of the United States; Smith, the Ca&s;hier, took him before Squire Jennings; but the great, hone&s;t, and Che&s;ter county Ca&s;hier, of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania, did, accor|ding to the report of the lad; &s;hew him (the lad), but little hu|manity. It is not always the ca&s;e that tho&s;e who rail vehe|mently again&s;t vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, are the mo&s;t virtuous.

Having de&s;cribed four pri&s;oners, the fifth one who was put into the room where I was under clo&s;e confinement, was put in the pri&s;on for keeping company with the young (lad, who was put in pri&s;on for having the fifty dollar note). This young man (who was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the companion of the other youth), had not re|mained in pri&s;on two weeks, before he became in an apparent or po&s;itive deranged &s;tate. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">every day (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">m circum&s;tances at|tendant on a pri&s;on), became more and more acquainted with my fellow pri&s;oners, one of the then pri&s;oners, gave me a

brief (but I believe a ju&s;t de&s;cription of captain Phelps), who was out of doors acting in conjunction with that amiable cha|racter, (known I believe throughout the United States by the name of John Sheaffer) for, and on account of propo&s;itions laid down to them, to receive an hire for villainy (perhaps heared of villainy or unheard of villainy), that is immaterial at pre&s;ent. Phelps was &s;peaking ju&s;tly and fairly, as hone&s;t a cha|racter to be tru&s;ted with an oath, as many others, (to &s;wear the life and character of an hone&s;t man away, to have, and ef|fect or cau&s;e for the gallows, though that man who&s;e life was to &s;wear away, was innocent), and was like others, as deep an endy'd &s;coundrel as ever di&s;graced walking the &s;urface of the Earth; and Sheaffer and company (it is rumoured) were his in|timates, and companions. He (this captain Phelps) would (if po&s;&s;ible), &s;wear away the life of any man, for the &s;ake of a re|ward. (Ju&s;tice being out of the ca&s;e, or it was immaterial to Phelps), for like all the <HI>ra&s;cally</HI> retainers of the law, for the &s;ake of a reward; he could guelph down both law and con|&s;cience without feeling pain or compunction: and Phelps for doing this was a hireling, (eight dollars the reward) for what? to &s;wear wrong, or right for the &s;ake of the &s;ee, the wicked gave again&s;t the innocent. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the &s;itu|ation I was then in, expecting to be &s;tarved, or doomed to more mi&s;ery, than I had already received; (though an inno|cent object of mi&s;ery, cruelly &s;ituated in regard to my&s;elf) I expected to be plunged into a &s;tate of &s;tarvation, through th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> means of an invidious individual.</P>
<P>About this time, one of my old journeymen who had a particular regard for me; wrote a letter, and gave it into the hands of Mr. Lace, the contents of the letter, were feeling, friendly, innocent, but unguarded; the purport was thus, tell|ing me to keep up a good heart, there was no fear, and &s;uch like. Mr. Lace examined the letter, and prudently witheld it, (as the police of Philadelphia, who&s;e fondne&s;s for commi&s;&s;ion on &s;light &s;u&s;picion, is but too prevalent, might have transform|ed the meaning of this letter, wrote in a &s;tyle of &s;implicity and unlettered partiality), as it might have been the cau&s;e of his im|pri&s;onment; by the bye, every letter mu&s;t be &s;ent into the pri|&s;on un&s;ealed&mdash;in a day or two, Mr Lace with the journeyman alluded to, with him, got leave to vi&s;it me. I complained of the &s;everity I &s;u&s;tained, and begged of the journeyman to go and bring me one of my beds from my hou&s;e. I told them of the plot that had been formed, (by the fertilized brains of two

complete villains); to wit, Sheaffer, and the Doctor, both con|victs, and the arch villain termed captain Phelps, a noted &s;windler, and and one of Doll Tear&s;heets' captains. Mr Lace was &s;truck with horror at the recital, and begged me to have no conver&s;ation with any of them, to &s;hun and avoid &s;peaking of my profe&s;&s;ion in any point of view whatever; by this time the twenty dollars that was &s;ent by Mr. Fox, and Mr. Stocker, (though both had complimented me with the &s;ending twenty dollars each, and rai&s;ed my expectations to forty dollars) was expended. Mr Lace procured me one of my beds, and &s;uppli|ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with provi&s;ion; about this time, the infamous captain Phelps' death was announced in the pri&s;on, which cau&s;ed the &s;cheme (entered into by a per&s;on or per&s;ons, as I firmly believe, and think with &s;trong proof) to prove an abortion. I now began to &s;ee into the internal regulations of the pri&s;on. A pri&s;oner was one afternoon playing a game of drafts, the board and what are called men, had been cut out with a knife; he was &s;eized by the collar&mdash;I addre&s;&s;ed the keeper thus, or nearly in the following words, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Pray Sir, where are you going to take this man? To the cells&mdash;he replied; for what, &s;ays I? his an&s;wer was, for playing at drafts&mdash;pray, Sir, quoth I, where is the great crime in that, con&s;ider and feel what are the prin|ciples of humanity: con&s;ider this man is naturally a brother, and perhaps innocent of his charge&mdash;you don't know who&s;e hands, your&s;elf may fall into yet&mdash;you make dreadful play|things of the keys of the cells&mdash;con&s;ider Sir, the crime of being the cau&s;e of &s;low murder. There is a God in heaven, (omni|potent and merciful; but who&s;e avenging arm could cru&s;h thy worthle&s;s carca&s;e to nothing, and who&s;e power could over|w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lm thy &s;oul with mi&s;ery), will judge of you. Be not hard, (&s;aid I), on your fellow creature, let the man go. The keeper let him go. The pri&s;oner then turned towards me, and with tears in his eyes, (and I love to &s;ee the tears of hone&s;t &s;en&s;i|bility, add<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed me in the following manner; May God al|mighty ble&s;s you&punc; Sir, I &s;hall be ever thankful to you. This &s;hort and conci&s;e prayer or ble&s;&s;ing, was worth more to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of my feelings, and of <HI>man,</HI> than all the money in the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania; and more than all the ill u&s;ed dro&s;s the world comprizes.</P>
<P>There is not, (if a man may be permitted to &s;peak his opinion), a better &s;chool for villainy, than the convict-yard o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Philad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pri&s;on. At this &s;chool I believe a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> might make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> with, more than he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> if

he was a con&s;tant vi&s;itor there. It is cu&s;tomary in every room when the pri&s;oners are locked up at night, to have a bucket; and the rule is, whoever makes u&s;e of the bucket fir&s;t, mu&s;t carry it down in the morning: it happened one night, that the bucket had been u&s;ed by &s;ome of the pri&s;oners; but by whom, it was not exactly known; however to end all di&s;putes, the Bible was got, and every one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n that room &s;wore, he did not u&s;e the bucket that night. This is a &s;pecimen of what an ingenious criminator might effect among&s;t &s;uch a &s;et of worthy di&s;ciples, e&s;pecially if he carried the means of &s;eeing with him; and a ju&s;t &s;pecimen of what you will find in Philadelphia pri&s;on. But this kind of fal&s;e &s;wearing was not confined to the pri&s;on; but others (their) accomplices out of doors, true brothers in iniquity, endeavoured to effect the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I now began to under&s;tand by the pri&s;oners, the meaning of the term, which I had heard u&s;ed by Mr. Fox, the Pre&s;ident of the Bank, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> The term <HI>Dubb,</HI> it is a fla&s;h term u&s;ed for key, and is u&s;ed among thieves. I under&s;tood from them, that there were (rum dubbs, que<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r dubbs, fluted dubbs,) and &s;uch a man was a good dubb&s;man; this (as I learned, from the genteel company, I was unju&s;tly confined with), is the genuine explanation of the term or ord dubb, which term I never had heard before it fell from the lips of Mr. Fox the Pre&s;ident. Nor had I the lea&s;t idea of the meaning of the term, till I was removed into that learned &s;eminary here the term was ex|plained, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> among&s;t thieves of all de&s;criptions.</P>
<P>Captain Phelps' character was very well under&s;tood by &s;everal of the pri&s;oners, but a more infamous character, (if what I heard was true, and of the truth of which information I have not the lea&s;t doubt), ever came to my notice: but as the man was dead, it gave me no concern; it may, however, be reduced to a certainty, that he had taken &s;everal fal&s;e oaths at &s;o low a rate as &s;ix dollars. From report, a gentleman inimi|cal to me, had vi&s;ited this notorious villain &s;everal times; pro|bably with a view to give latitude to his intentions. The next that was hired on this nefarious bu&s;ine&s;s, was one of the name of Miller, a former convict and who was in for another offence: I found by his di&s;cour&s;e, he was a &s;apper and miner under the orders of General John Sheaffer, and a certain gentleman; but I followed the advice of my worthy friend Lace, to hold little conver&s;ation with any of the convicts; nor give an idea to any villain of my workman&s;hip. I told Miller I could not do the
<PB N="44" REF="035752_0043_1006641BC610CBA0">
work I was charged with, and that I did not follow key mak|ing, and was only a rough &s;mith. Miller and the re&s;t of his gang, gave up the idea of wire drawing any unguarded expre&s;|&s;ion from me. The Robbery &s;till remained undi&s;covered, and my treatment hard: no friend was admitted to &s;ee me, or communicate with me. If I wrote a few lines, they were burnt or de&s;troyed. If Mr. Lace wrote to me, it was the &s;ame. I was obliged when pri&s;oners were di&s;charged, to write him by means of their conveyance, to prevent him giving him&s;elf too much trouble on my account, as he earne&s;tly felt for my &s;ituation: one night after all the pri&s;oners were locked up, the head gaolor came to the door where I was confined, and called me by name: I an&s;wered, Sir. Have you got a brother, &s;ays he, yes Sir, I replied, where is he? I don't know, here I pau&s;ed, for I did not know but they might have hauled him into pri&s;on as well as my&s;elf; as the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion ac|cording to what I had experienced my&s;elf might warrant &s;uch an act. At la&s;t I an&s;wered, if you a&s;k Mr. Ludlam, the plum|ber he can tell you; the gaoler told me he was dead at New-York of the Yellow fever, this circum&s;tance was more plea|&s;ing to me, than if he had undergone, one weeks puni&s;hment, &s;uch as I had experienced he mu&s;t (from puni&s;hment like mine), have fallen a victim for Potter's-field, his con&s;titution being broke, and his health greatly impaired before. About the 14th of November, Jonathan Smith, the Ca&s;hier, &s;ent for me out of the ea&s;t-wing of the pri&s;on. The room when I went below, and where he was waiting for me, had every thing cleared away but a few chairs, hand-cuffs, &amp;c. when I entered the room, the goaler &s;hut the door; Smith then began, well, Mr. Lyon, you are here yet. I took a chair to &s;it down; but while &s;itting down, I &s;aid the following words, to this great Ca&s;hier, <HI>Yes, Sir, I am here yet,</HI> and if it had not been for your &s;peculation, I &s;hould have been out before this. Why &s;o, what &s;pecula|tion of mine? did you not go per&s;onally and tell tho&s;e people that were to have been my bail, that you was &s;ure I had a hand in the bu&s;ine&s;s? yes, &s;ays he, and <HI>I am &s;ure of it;</HI> and at the &s;ametime, kept winking with his &s;tarboard eye, with all the appearance of low cunning, the mo&s;t con&s;umate gentleman could make u&s;e of: for the purpo&s;e I imagine, of extracting from my countenance, &s;omething or other that he might make u&s;e of to my injury; at tho&s;e words I took fire, I told him his in&s;inuations were fal&s;e, and that through his means and others, I was ruin|ed,
<PB N="45" REF="035752_0044_1006641E7854D278">
and all they could do now, was to take me out of pri&s;on and crucify me. He got tired by this time of winking with his &s;tarbord eye, and then &s;et too with his larboard eye, and put that in motion. We, &s;aid he, have &s;ound the keys, and can prove you made them. I defy you and all the &s;eed of Adam to prove that I was ever guilty of a mean action. You (&s;ays he) &s;hall be kept in pri&s;on, you &s;hall be tried at the bar. I can bear, &s;aid I, my confinement and puni&s;hment with glory, being honoured with feelings ari&s;ing from innocence&mdash;we parted. I mu&s;t confe&s;s my temper was warmed, owing to his long in&s;inuating winking, which would have more be|come a Billing&s;gate fi&s;h-woman, or a Poi&s;&s;arde of Paris, than a Ca&s;hier of a State Bank. I was next vi&s;ited by a Mr. Samuel Rhoads, (and a gentleman with him) an entire &s;tranger to me; here I thought it was requi&s;ite for me to be upon my guard. He then began his &s;tory, to wit. Mr. Lyon my &s;moke-jack is out of order, I am &s;orry for that, Sir, &s;aid I; cannot you, &s;aid he, tell what is the matter with it: I &s;miled, and was obliged to bite my under lip to prevent me from laughing, and then told him if I &s;aw the jack there was a probability I could tell him what was the matter; but not el&s;e. What time do you expect to get out? I cannot tell you, Sir, I am willing to &s;atisfy the public in any legal form, enquiry, or otherwi&s;e; but do not expect to get out before next court. Well, &s;ays he, I mu&s;t wait. The gentleman who was a &s;tranger to me, then addre&s;&s;ed me. Mr. Lyon, what is the charge alledged again&s;t you? I told him. They certainly cannot keep you here if there is no oath again&s;t you; have you got any money, becau&s;e you can make them pay &s;weetly for keeping you here. I gave him no &s;atisfaction as to that point; but I &s;aid, if I am brought to the bar, I am informed there may be a &s;omething, have a cloudy appearance, again&s;t Smith the Ca&s;hier.

<P>"It appears that one I&s;aac Davis, a carpenter, and a noted democrat, in conjunction with a porter belonging to the Bank, who died of the &s;ever, were the &s;ole agents in this nefarious bu&s;ine&s;s.

On the death of his accomplice, he took the whole of the ca&s;h, (of which a dividend had been made), into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and as detected by means of the large depo&s;its he had made in each of the Banks."</P>
<P>"N. B. Citizen Davis had made off."</P>
<P>The name of Davis I knew not, or which of the porters were concerned with him, I was equally at a lo&s;s to know; at this time, I was even unacquainted with the names of either of the porters of the Bank. However, I made &s;trict enquiry of Mr. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">n, the head goaler, who gave me this information, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "That it was one Davis a carpenter, who wrought at the Bank, and one Cunningham a porter belonging to &s;aid Bank." The name of Cunningham was not more familiar to my ear than the name of Davis, for I knew neither. I then wrote to my tried friend Lace, to endeavour to get my liberty. He waited on Mr Fox, but got no &s;atisfactory an&s;wer: he wrote to me in pri&s;on that he would bring me my di&s;charge in a few ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">, which was what I had long been expecting, and on account of &s;uch information, gave an additional quickne&s;s of hearing to me, and an additional expectation likewi&s;e, being glad to hear, receive, and indulge my&s;elf, on &s;uch information; I was preparing to have the di&s;mality attending on, and the horre&s;cent &s;cene of a <HI>Pri&s;on.</HI> But re&s;entment had not yet quitted the malignant brea&s;t of &s;ome &s;ecret enemy, (which I verily believe) I had in that Bank, and who from the &s;everal ideas of my fel|low pri&s;oners, which were regularly entertained by them, ca&s;t a deep &s;u&s;picion in my mind, upon a particular individual; (and who are better judges of a &s;chool-ma&s;ter than his &s;cholars). My fellow pri&s;oners wrote to Smith the Ca&s;hier, and (from what influence I know not), were by degrees di&s;charged under the orders of the Mayor. I do not know what weight, (in the

&s;cale of ju&s;tice or influence), might have been thrown in. If I had wrote a whining, canting, hypocritical, and de&s;picable let|ter to the Bank, like &s;ome per&s;ons: there might I believe have been &s;ome repugnance again&s;t their uniform &s;y&s;tem of cruelty; but truly &s;peaking my mind, I would have &s;ooner died under the hard&s;hips an innocent man &s;uffered, than I would have di&s;graced my firmne&s;s, as a man, to a&s;k a paltry boon from a character like Smith, the Ca&s;hier. Independent, native, ho|ne&s;ty forbade it. For in the fir&s;t place, he came to the pri&s;on and fal&s;ely accu&s;ed me; and I had previou&s;ly heard, that this Machiavel was the mo&s;t inveterate enemy I had in the Bank: and in the &s;econd place, (if I could judge of the &s;y&s;tem laid down by Lavater), there appeared a down, &s;ullen, hanging, and revengful look about him, that made me think if I was a Judge upon a criminal ca&s;e, &s;uch a pri&s;oner would not not have gained much by the favour of nature; but I believe mankind may mi&s;take on the principles of phy&s;iognomy, for many a man, with a fine appearance, has de&s;erved the gallows, and many a valu|able diamond, has been unju&s;tly puni&s;hed, becau&s;e he had a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ough out&s;ide. My worthy friend, Mr. Lace, went to Mr. Hallowell the attorney, to know why I was detained in pri&s;on. Mr. Hollowell waited upon Mr. Fox, who received him complai|&s;antly with one of his tea table ob&s;ervations, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That Cun|ningham, (the man decea&s;ed accu&s;ed, and who&s;e evidence now can be of no avail before any human judicature); might have dealt with me for fal&s;e keys, as well as any other man. And that they were determined to puni&s;h me as far as the law would admit of. Here all my friends at this trying cri&s;is bore the a&s;pect of alarm; blu&s;hing at, (as they &s;uppo&s;ed), &s;uch unju&s;ti|fiable conduct. Then under &s;uch a con&s;ideration, my worthy friend Mr. Lace, was advi&s;ed to employ Mr. Dallas, coun&s;ellor at law, (who I believe is the hone&s;t man's friend, and an ex|cellent expounder of the law&mdash;and though he may have ene|mies, merit always cau&s;es them; yet he is I believe the a ju&s;t and worthy lawyer).</P>
<P>I now got a new pair of &s;tockings, and ob&s;erved as I had worn a pair of old &s;tockings for eight weeks, the &s;ervice they had undergone would pay for the new; and I &s;ent the old ones to Lace to give an emblematical idea of the pri&s;on. I began at this time to prepare for trial, and did not know, but &s;ome gentlemen might endeavour to have a &s;econd edition of their former works in folio, not rough, but neatly bound, and lettered. Under &s;uch apparent circum&s;tances, I &s;ent for a
<PB N="49" REF="035752_0048_1006642A62BC8C30">
quire of paper, and wrote (as far as I was able, con&s;idering every thing), my travail and defence. After completing the whole, the keeper of the ea&s;t wing of the pri&s;on came to me, after locking up, and told me that my friend Lace was below, waiting for, or ready to receive my writings, which I delivered to the keeper, but my writings were debarred going beyond the confines of the pri&s;on door. In le&s;s than ten minutes after this, Mr. Fox &s;ent up &s;tairs for one of the name of Martin, who was in for forging notes on the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania; whatever pa&s;&s;ed between Mr. Fox and Martin, was none of my concern I thought; be that as it may, the &s;tratagem I believe was effected, and my writings I &s;uppo&s;e fell into the hands of Mr. Fox, which gave me but very little unea&s;ine&s;s. In &s;hort, if Mr. Fox had read my writings, he mu&s;t have &s;een by them, that he had no impul&s;e, feelingly, to act again&s;t me from motives of his own; but I believe he had a prompter behind the curtain, to teach him the &s;cenes of tragedy.</P>
<P>It was, (by who&s;e order I know not), a Mr. Wood, a clerk to, or for the pri&s;on, who &s;topt my writings, and which I think he had no right to do, as it was taking the advantage of an unpre|pared and innocent pri&s;oner. And believe every pri&s;oner has a right to write to any friend; providing there is no relation con|tained in it of con&s;piracy of &s;uch like. But no, it &s;eems (&s;ays <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to my&s;elf), there is a policy, to get as many mechanics in the convict yard as po&s;&s;ible, and be &s;ure, (&s;ays this narrow minded policy), get as many old countrymen, (as the term is commonly u&s;ed), as you can; it is not much matter under what pretence.</P>
<P>The court where my trial was to have been, was in &s;uch a &s;tate of prolongation, that many worthy and re&s;pectable men, thought it was cruel, wanton, and malicious in the Bank, (or their agents), to do as they did towards me, as every unpre|judiced and unjaundiced eye, could without winking di&s;cern their &s;pleen. It was therefore thought proper that I &s;hould be removed by a &s;econd habeas corpus, before the Supreme Court. My friend Mr. Lace, by this time had employed Mr. Dallas, (of who&s;e ability and integrity I unque&s;tionably entertained a high opinion), in favour of me. Though I thought it was as &s;trange, as it is incon&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on, to employ a lawyer to defend an innocent man: but when I took a view of the train of villainy, which had been carried on again&s;t me, I clearly perceived it required as much trouble to extricate an innocent man from Philadelphia pri&s;on, as it did a guilty one; the con|vict-yard,
<PB N="50" REF="035752_0049_1006642BE7BD62B8">
and policy thereof, (as far as I could judge from reflection and ob&s;ervation), are enough to make humanity &s;hud|der, as perhaps there may be many an innocent man &s;uffering years of &s;lavery, therefore it requires every exertion of the pri|&s;oner to be u&s;ed in his defence; particularly if he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s an ingeni|ous mechanic, and what is termed an old countryman likewi&s;e. A few days previous to my removal before the Supreme Court, my friend Mr. Lace called on me at the pri&s;on, and told every circum&s;tance in regard to my removal; and that Mr. Inger&s;ol the Attorney-General, was to plead again&s;t me. I told Mr. Lace, I thought it was hard I &s;hould be &s;ou&s;ed; but if Mr. Inger&s;ol is again&s;t me, I know he will do every thing in his power to hurt me, becau&s;e he has a private animo&s;ity again&s;t me, on account of trade. On the 14th of December, 1798. I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, and about 10 o'clock, I was &s;ent for out of the ea&s;t wing of the pri&s;on, to be conducted before the Supreme Court by one of the Keepers: however I would not go over the pri&s;on door, until my writings were re&s;tored to me. After &s;ome deliberation I got my writings, which contained mo&s;t of the former part of this work; I was then conducted before the Supreme Court, accompanied by one of the keepers, and my &s;teady and con&s;tant friend Mr. Lace. After waiting &s;ome time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was called up before the three Judges, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Judges M. Kean, Shippen, and Smith. Mr. Fox &s;wore nearly to the &s;ame effect as he did before Judge Shippen, when I was remov|ed by habeas corpus the fir&s;t time; and he want over the &s;u&s;|picions which I delivered before Mr. Stocker, which was about &s;ix weeks before the robbery was di&s;covered; and in tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions, as I have related before in this work, concerning Robin&s;on the carpenter, and his companion; I thought I had good grounds for &s;u&s;pecting them from their confu&s;ed appear|ance at the &s;ight of me, when drinking together at Market-&s;treet ferry; and their nice in&s;pection of the locks when at my &s;hop.</P>
<P>Smith, the Ca&s;hier, <HI>&s;worn.</HI> It &s;eemed to me he could hardly hold up his head, from what cau&s;e I know not, but I may &s;ugge&s;t from his evidence given again&s;t me, his humane feelings in regard to me were not very poignant.

the wor&s;t of the two, as I have related before, it is an old room door lock, with the latches taken out. However Smith, &s;till went on, although he could not hold up his head, (being not of the Corinthian, but the leaden order); he &s;wore after the robbery was committed, he ob&s;erved the key of the vault, had &s;ome plai&s;ter or cement on it. He, &s;aid Smith, the Ca&s;hier, &s;wore likewi&s;e, that there had been a print of the key taken as it appeared to him on wax, or on clay, or on putty, or on plai&s;|ter of Paris. From &s;uch an oath as this, it was ea&s;y to conceive any per&s;on's drift; in &s;hort, a di&s;appointed gentleman, might not know in what manner to bring his &s;wearing to bear, becau&s;e the reader may ob&s;erve, there is in this oath, the colour of gold, of copper, of &s;ilver, of lead, and &s;everal mixtures. Here I cannot help making one ob&s;ervation, with regard to my phy|&s;iognomonical knowledge, and I do publicly declare, I can read a man's con&s;cience, and will not be deceived at a le&s;s propor|tion, than as one to &s;ix. At this time I could read Smith the Ca&s;hier, through and through; and it appeared to me the inde|lible mark of con&s;cience was perceivably depicted on his brow, though fate may have ordained him for another purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Robin&s;on &s;wore, (the companion and intimate of I&s;aac Davis), this Quiz, (for the Bank &s;ent me to the fla&s;h &s;chool), was in &s;uch a condition, that the Judges were obliged, to tell him to hold up his head, and &s;peak out; and many of the &s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">tors from the appearance of the man, &s;uppo&s;ed him to have been the thief. As they &s;aid he confe&s;&s;ed I told him of the in&s;e|curity of the locks more than once, which proves that my knowledge of the crippled &s;tate of that Bank was not wrong; but well founded.

<P>John alias Jack Haines &s;addler, and high con&s;table and one of the wire-drawers of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania or their agents&mdash;&s;wore, that he vi&s;ited me twice, and that I told him I knew who committed the robbery; and that I ob&s;erved to him, I would not te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l until I got my liberty and &s;wore that I &s;ent for him to communicate the &s;ame. He went on with a long train of cant, peculiar to him&s;elf. (Mr. Fox &s;wore mi&s;takenly once, which can be proved); but this evidence wound up the whole; I declare I never heard a man &s;wallow the gudgeon before &s;o completely (I am much obliged to the Bank for the knowledge of &s;ome phra&s;eology I occa&s;ionly make u&s;e of, as they &s;ent me to a well educated &s;eminary): But the reward I believe was his object, and like a man dreaming that he had a large

quantity of ca&s;h in his fi&s;t&punc; and awaking in the morning found it to be a dream, and being a &s;hadow in&s;tead of reality, feels forcibly the di&s;appointment. I mu&s;t acknowledge, I &s;ported with him, when I &s;u&s;pected the reward was his object, and he very artfully turned the word <HI>&s;u&s;pect,</HI> into the word <HI>know</HI>&mdash;my &s;u&s;|picions with regard to Mr. Robin&s;on, and his companion, was all along kept &s;ecret until this time; when to my great &s;urpri&s;e the &s;trange gentleman that came to my &s;hop, with Robin&s;on, and whom I had a phy&s;iognomonical view of at Market-&s;treet fer|ry; this &s;trange gentleman and companion to Robin&s;on, turned out to be I&s;aac Davis who robbed the Bank, and in who&s;e po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion the money was found. This is &s;ome proof of my know|ledge, only by looking a man in the face, and it is the deepe&s;t knowledge I know of. The Attorney-General began; I ob&s;er|ved this gentleman's conduct before, and I was not the lea&s;t de|ceived, he went on with my travel from Philadelphia and with a great many in&s;inuations thereon, much to my di&s;advantage, and which were not founded upon fact. Mr. Dallas pleaded feelingly for my long &s;uffering, and proving an Alibi, was &s;uf|ficient to have di&s;charged me. The Attorney-General then read the depo&s;ition of Samuel Wheeler. This depo&s;ition I have frequently applied for; but could not obtain, which I am well aware of, I ought to have obtained, which was either fal&s;e, or malicious. One ob&s;ervation the Attorney-General advanced was a po&s;itive truth, to wit, that I had expre&s;&s;ed in pri&s;on, that I was only a common Smith, and never made keys, and I de|fyed any per&s;on to come forward and prove that they ever &s;aw me make a key of any de&s;cription: this part I acknowledge to be true, as I was advi&s;ed to do &s;o on account of the villainous de&s;ign that was plotting to &s;wear away my life; to deny that I was a lock-&s;mith, in any point of view. The Attor|ney-General got this information I &s;uppo&s;e from Smith, the Ca&s;hier: who frequently vi&s;ited the thieves in that pri&s;on&mdash;whether he carried the means to fee with him, I cannot tell. He then read the paper, which Mr. Stocker wrote on my &s;e|cond examination, which is &s;everal times related in this work. The reader will &s;ee, how well my &s;u&s;picions were grounded; Robin&s;on was then a&s;ked by one of the Judges if he was well acquainted with Davis: he began to make an&s;wer (but was ordered again to hold up his head, and &s;peak out), he &s;aid he knew him when he was 'prentice, and had been intimate with him ever &s;ince. The Attorney-General then began (but I mu&s;t not &s;ay to his credit) to deliberate on the oath of the renowned <HI>Black-&s;mith</HI> Samuel Wheeler, which was his chief
<PB N="53" REF="035752_0052_100664320A14FE60">
ground work. And the lock of the Supreme Court, had the &s;ame fini&s;h, (which Samuel Wheeler &s;wore it &s;hould not): let any lock-&s;mith, or any other black-&s;mith, even Smith the Ca&s;h|ier, I &s;ay what mu&s;t they think of a man, who has &s;worn either fal&s;ly and maliciou&s;ly or from ignorance, that the &s;crews of the cap of &s;uch a lock, were always filed off flu&s;h with the lock-plate. I tell the public (I have no occa&s;ion to tell profe&s;&s;i|onal men) that the cap &s;crews of iron rim-locks are always rounded at the points, and &s;crewed about two threads through the lock-plate, and not filed off flu&s;h as Samuel Wheeler <HI>&s;wore.</HI> There is no large lock filed off flu&s;h with the lock-plate, or plates except mortice-locks: this is a piece of information &s;imple as it appears, that will &s;erve to give Samuel Wheeler, a le&s;&s;on he did not know any thing of. Here is another &s;trik|ing in&s;tance of Samuel Wheeler's judgment in Bank-locks, he was &s;ent to repair a lock as I am informed, by the &s;mith who alter|ed the doors for the other vault: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e the &s;aid Wheeler took the lock to pieces and not knowing what was the matter with it, took a large hammer and with the penn thereof, drew the bit of the key, &s;o as to lay a greater hold of the talons of the bolt; by doing this the celebrated gate-maker altered the key &s;o much, that the key would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it the wards of the locks; and like a true wi&s;e man of Gotham, was obliged to tear out the wards of the lock, which ju&s;t &s;uits the &s;hallow unmechanical ideas of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania. A general conver&s;ation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ook place in the court among&s;t all hands, I begged to be heard, and began from the period of leaving the city to the time the robbery was di&s;covered, and by extracts from the former parts of this work, (without any flattery to my&s;elf) made a tolerable good defence; but when I came to mention, that one of the locks of the vault being an old room door lock, with the latches taken out; Mr. Fox would not let it pa&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n the court, <HI>he contradicted it.</HI> Smith the Ca&s;hier, (who has all the appearance of a runner), went &s;peedily out of the court and brought back a Quaker with him. The Quaker did not &s;wear but affirmed, that I &s;aid the locks were good and could not be picked, I never had any conver&s;ation with the man about locks of any di&s;cription in my life; but it appeared to me he was brought forward to &s;erve a purpo&s;e.

brought this Quaker to &s;wallow the gudgeon&mdash;lucky in|deed for me Captain Phelps was dead. However, I could not get John Haines' oath and I a&s;ked (as he had already &s;worn, that I &s;ent for him), if he could tell by whom, he could not, nor <HI>can</HI> tell of any per&s;on I &s;ent to him to this day; but he being fond of a lazy life, (if a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> may judge from the ac|ceptation of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation), wanted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of loave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and fi&s;hes, at who&s;e expen&s;e, is immaterial to me. Mr. Dal|las made &s;everal very feeling remarks &s;o as to operate forcibly on the minds of all pre&s;ent, to effect my di&s;charge: but the oath of Smith the Ca&s;hier, with his wax, clay, putty, plai&s;ter of Paris and the Devil and him&s;elf knows what, Haines' ob|&s;ervation, ari&s;ing from mortified di&s;appointment, and Whee|ler's ignorant and mi&s;taken oath.&mdash;The honourable Judge M'Kean held me to a bail of two thou&s;and dollars.

Mr. Dallas turned to me, and a&s;ked if I could rai&s;e bail for the above &s;um I an&s;wered I could not tell, as it appeared to me I was a &s;tranger in the land. A Mr. Bryden being in the court came forward as one of my bail, I a&s;ked him how much he could bail me for, he &s;aid he would bail me for &pound;.800 this was more than two thou&s;and dollars; but it was nece&s;&s;ary to have two, I was permitted to go to my neighbour|hood, under the care of the keeper of the ea&s;t wing of the pri&s;on; I went to the hou&s;e of Richard Guy, and a&s;ked him if he would bail me for one thou&s;and dollars, he an&s;wered yes, five thou&s;and if you want it. Bail was entered by both the&s;e friends; and all that know them, know they would not bail a di&s;hone&s;t man.

<P>Thus fini&s;hes this dialogue for the pre&s;ent; but as there is another &s;imilar, which took place between the &s;ame parties, after the bill was found IGNORAMUS, I &s;hall take notice of it in turn. I then began to enquire into the character of Smith, the Ca&s;hier of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania, and was told that he was originally bred to country work. I was inclined to believe the report from two cau&s;es, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> He had been a bitter enemy again&s;t me, that inclined me to believe a report however un|founded. The &s;econd was from his appearance, manners, and language, corre&s;pondent with tho&s;e of black-&s;miths, butchers, &s;ailors, cart-drivers, &amp;c. But a man who has been put into the office of one of the State Banks, to make u&s;e of &s;uch lan|guage as he did, and to &s;ay that he was &s;orry an innocent man had got out of pri&s;on, and that they would u&s;e him wor&s;e and confine him longer; I a&s;k if all this was con&s;i&s;tent, for a man in his then pre&s;ent &s;ituation. Mrs. Smith no doubt &s;aw the &s;ide which her hu&s;band had taken, and was apprehen&s;ive for his &s;afety. The circum&s;tance of binding me down was very ea&s;ily effected, for this was the only truth he &s;wore, to wit, my &s;aying in pri&s;on that I would be revenged on him. But the &s;tratagems which were carried on by the Bank, wind up the whole, which they had carried on under their idea of ju&s;|tice. The &s;tory of Smith being bred to country work, I found to be fal&s;e; as I have it from good authority that he was brought up to be a quill driver from a boy and &s;eldom or ever country bumpkins carry pen-knives with them.</P>
<P>I now had time to lay my hard, though innocent ca&s;e, before Mr. Dallas who told me all he wanted of me was to get &s;ome per&s;ons to come forward and give me a good character and to bring them forward; I told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I could bring forward &s;ome of the fir&s;t m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n in the city: he required al&s;o if it was po&s;&s;i|ble, to bring any per&s;on who knew me at home.

ten years ago, with this Mr. Dallas was perfectly &s;atisfied; but Mr. Lyon &s;aid he, I heard it whi&s;pered in the court, that you had 1400 dollars <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> one of the Banks, I an&s;wered that was true, and the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania is apprehen&s;ive that it is &s;ome of their money. As I have already given the reader an account of the &s;tatement of my Bank book in the former part of this work, it will be needle&s;s to go over the &s;ame ground. I told Mr. Dallas I would &s;atisfy the world on that point, he &s;aid that was all that was wanting; but Mr. Dallas added they may be inqui&s;itive to know how you made this money, I told him I would bring my books and a gene|ral &s;tatement of my worldly affairs, &amp;c. Several of my ac|quaintances were very bu&s;y in collecting every information re&s;pecting the unju&s;tifiable conduct of the Bank towards me, I was told that John Corneck who keeps the &s;ign of the Hor&s;e and Groom in Stawberry-alley, had &s;ome information to give me. I went to Mr. Corneck and took a friend with me, he informed me that Cunningham, the porter, who &s;lept in the Bank (as the term is), one night was obliged to &s;leep at his hou&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he could not get into the Bank to &s;leep, owing to a particu|lar mi&s;take, to wit, after Cunningham had locked up the Bank, and Smith and him coming away, (Cunningham going to get his &s;upper I &s;uppo&s;e, and then to return to the Bank to &s;leep). Smith handed Cunningham a key, which was not the key of the front door; but Cunningham going to the Bank with an intent to &s;leep I &s;uppo&s;e, or to make nece&s;&s;ary arrangements for robbing it, I know not; be that as it may, the key that Cunningham had, would not fit the front door lock, therefore Cunningham was obliged to &s;leep at Mr. Corneck's that night: and Mr. Corneck publicly declared that he &s;aw Cunningham go to bed, and he &s;aw Cunningham tye this key to his neck with his garter, and he &s;lept with the key all night. I will leave to the readers to judge what key this mu&s;t have been. Being under bail, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;ettle my mind to my profe&s;&s;ional bu&s;ine&s;s, and being very &s;ucce&s;sful in collect|ing every circum&s;tance, &s;o as to make the Bank no doubt in the eyes of many appear incon&s;i&s;tent and ridiculous.&mdash;I found out where both the watchmen were, belonging to the Bank, and had the opportunity of examining both tho&s;e hone&s;t men: (who were implicated by Smith the Ca&s;hier) and in &s;hort their commitment was wrote, and the Mayor was he&s;itating whether to &s;end both tho&s;e poor men to pri&s;on, or not.

<P>While writing the above memorial, out come the declara|tion of the Committee of the Legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania; to whom was referred that part of the Governor's addre&s;s, which relates to the robbery of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania, and upon which I &s;hall be very conci&s;e. "That on the night of the 4th of Augu&s;t la&s;t, &s;ome per&s;on or per&s;ons entered the banking hou&s;e in
<PB N="60" REF="035752_0059_10066441328695E8">
Lodge-alley, and made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to force open the doors of the ca&s;h-vault, and to pick the lock of an iron che&s;t u&s;ed by the &s;econd teller." Let any per&s;on fir&s;t con&s;ider the &s;ecurity of a Bank when it is &s;o lame and unprovided, as to yield to every attempt of an entry; it goes on con&s;idering the in&s;ecurity of the building, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of making &s;uch repairs to it as would render it &s;afe to tru&s;t the property any longer there. The immediate removal of the Bank to Carpenter's-Hall was propo&s;ed&mdash;This building from it's con&s;truction, and the im|provements which had been made to it in the occupancy of the Bank of the United States, was thought perfectly &s;ecure. <HI>Remark,</HI> This fir&s;t attempt of the robbery as kept a pro|found &s;ecret, and the reader will keep in his memory, that in the fir&s;t part of this work, I being unea&s;y, went to Lodge-alley where the preparations were &s;till going on, and found Robin&s;on; I a&s;ked him the meaning why the work was &s;topped, his an&s;wer to me was, he would put me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to it by and bye: at the &s;ame time giving me &s;trict charge to take no notice to the bricklayer; however I &s;uppo&s;e this was his meaning. The Committee goes on; "but previou&s;ly to the removal, which took place on the Saturday following, <HI>a new patent lock</HI> for the outer door was procured."&mdash;<HI>Remark,</HI> This patent lock is &s;old in London by a Mr. Ives, corner of Shoe-lane, Fleet-&s;treet: this is the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant patent that ever was granted by his maje&s;ty king George the third of Great Britain. The wards of this lock are clum&s;y and of &s;olid bra&s;s, which cau&s;es the cavities of the key to be ex|tremely wide and ea&s;y to be copied. This lock had two tum|blers, which may attract the attention of tho&s;e who do not know better. It does not &s;ignify if a lock had a dozen tum|blers, provided you can procure a key the &s;ame as the original. On the &s;ame day, (Saturday), in the Banking-hou&s;e, I took up this &s;tupid lock, and the inner door lock; and in the pre&s;ence of Clement Garret&s;on, told Robin&s;on the carpenter, that both the&s;e locks were not fit for a bank; he an&s;wered me, that the front one had a double tumbler. It has been whi&s;pered to me that I&s;aac Davis procured this patent lock, and this lock I leave to tho&s;e mechanics who are acquainted with the art, and the At|torney-General to explain, (for he &s;topped in the middle of Samuel Wheeler's art). The Committee goes on; "The watch|man were charged to be particularly vigilant," and I am author|i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed before witne&s;s, to tell the committee, Sam Fox, Sam Ro|bin&s;on, Sam Wheeler, Sam Rhodes, and all the Sams, or
<PB N="61" REF="035752_0060_100664430BE81498">
Neddies belonging to the Bank; that it is a downright fal&s;ity. They declare publickly that no &s;uch charge was given to them, and that it was kept a &s;ecret that any attempt was ever made on the Bank. The Committee adds, "That Mr. Anne&s;ly, the run|ner, having occa&s;ion to go to the Bank to complete &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s which he had left unfini&s;hed the evening before, found the back door of the Banking-hou&s;e open; and looking into the room, he to his great &s;urprize, di&s;covered the doors of the back vault likewi&s;e open: he immediately rou&s;ed the port<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> who was a&s;leep up &s;tairs&mdash;Cunningham immediately came down &s;tairs and unlocked the front, as well as the inner door of the hou&s;e, they went into the Banking room and found all the window &s;hutters &s;ecure, the back door unbarred, and the doors of the ca&s;h vault unlocked. Mr. Anne&s;ly went immedi|ately to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the re&s;idence of the Ca&s;hier, and apprized him of what he di&s;covered."</P>
<P><HI>Remark,</HI> Cunningham came down &s;tairs and unlocked the front and inner doors&mdash;the opening the inner door was what &s;taggered my pro&s;ecutor (or per&s;ecutors) on my examination: for this lock mu&s;t be opened before they could come to the vault doors and when I a&s;ked this que&s;tion there appeared to be a con&s;cious &s;ilence among&s;t the whole, (or among&s;t all hands) it is &s;aid the back door was unba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">d. The back door it &s;eems had no lock at all; but ju&s;t barred like a barn door, in&s;tead of a banking hou&s;e. The doors of the ca&s;h vault un|locked; but how the&s;e doors were unlocked is &s;till kept a &s;e|cret, and when Mr. Anne&s;ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ent to the Ca&s;hier I do not know that any particular &s;urprize was evinced.</P>
<P>The Committee&mdash;"A me&s;&s;age was immediately &s;ent to the Pre&s;ident of the Bank; upon his coming to the city he found the Ca&s;hier, Runner and Porter in the Bank. Upon an exa|mination of the hou&s;e, it was found the locks had been open|ed by fal&s;e keys, for no injury had been done to the wards of them, nor was there any appearance of force having been u&s;ed."&mdash;<HI>Remark,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e before the Pre&s;ident came, the Por|ter might have got the matter (or matters), in train, an a prepa|rative for his reception. The Committee goes on, "That &s;e|veral per&s;ons were arre&s;ted upon &s;u&s;picion, and among&s;t tho&s;e, is Patrick Lyon the Smith, who was employed in fitting the iron doors of the ca&s;h-vault; and without who&s;e privity it is believed this robbery has not been committed."&mdash;<HI>Remark,</HI> This Committee compo&s;ed of three members, (their names I &s;hall mention hereafter), but they certainly have to the eyes of their

If the language they have made u&s;e of re&s;|pecting me is not of their manufacture, let them publicly de|clare it; and whether derived from a Fox, a Smith, a Stoc|ker, or from whom. This very ca&s;e I hope will &s;erve as a le&s;|&s;on to all the &s;tates in their a&s;&s;emblies, never to run headlong into mi&s;chief not a&s;certainable: with re&s;pect to the policy at|tending the affair, it evidently carries with it every feature of di&s;gui&s;ed fear: and it will hereafter be placed in the hi&s;tory of extraordinary things, that an individual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ingenuity in the line of his profe&s;&s;ion; &s;hould be made a martyr of, be|cau&s;e he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es that ingenuity: and I defy the world to prove that even the ingenuity I do po&s;&s;e&s;s, was applied to any bad purpo&s;e, but always to the contrary.</P>
<P>The committee &s;ay, "They had the &s;atisfaction to di&s;cover the perpetrator of this daring robbery, &s;o that the whole amount of the property &s;tolen, has been recovered, except about three thou&s;and, two hundred dollars. One I&s;aac Davis, <HI>a</HI> carpen|ter by trade, had an account open in the Bank, (or in the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania), and the fir&s;t circum&s;tance which excited the &s;u&s;picion of the Pre&s;ident and Ca&s;hier again&s;t him, was the depo&s;it of 16,000 dollars; enquiry was made into his circum|&s;tances and character, which was found to be &s;uch as to induce the officers to watch his conduct. On Saturday the 17th of November, ju&s;t before the Bank clo&s;ed, he depo&s;ited 3,910 dollars. Their &s;u&s;picions were then increa&s;ed, and it was thought proper to enquire at the Banks of the United States and North America, whether he had any accounts open with tho&s;e in&s;titutions, and on Monday morning &s;uch information was obtained, as left no doubt that he was the robber." <HI>Re|mark,</HI> This I&s;aac Davis was the man, as I have often before ob&s;erved, that I long &s;u&s;pected before I went out of town, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was along with Robin&s;on at Market-&s;treet ferry.

Jonathan Smith, Ca&s;hier of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania, (well knew, or ought to well know) his character and circum&s;tances. Smith mu&s;t have known that the finances of Davis, were not capable of keeping a carriage, and Davis's childi&s;h ob&s;ervation on an India adventure, ought not to have e&s;caped the penetrating &s;agacity of a Bank Ca&s;hier.

<P>The Committee &s;ays, "he, (Davis), was invited to the hou&s;e of the Ca&s;hier, upon a pretence which excited no apprehen&s;ion of the views of the officers: and their party, by threats of an immediate arre&s;t, and by promi&s;e of an interce&s;&s;ion with the Governor for a pardon, a confe&s;&s;ion of his guilt was ext<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d from him."&mdash;<HI>Remark,</HI> This is the grande&s;t farce of the whole, and well played off; the Committee has not told their &s;tory perfectly right at all: what I have under&s;tood is as follows, he was invited by his acquaintance Smith to his hou&s;e, by way of joke, to do &s;ome work; (and in which hou&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e he &s;pent many a joyous evening): and it was told to me Mr. Fox was one of the actors in this farcical &s;cene. Mr. Fox I under&s;tand, was placed in a dark room, with a pi&s;tol and a cutla&s;s, and I &s;up|po&s;e there were &s;ome others of equal bravery, who &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;hield of heaven would defend both their courage and their carca&s;es, all equally armed. Smith the Ca&s;hier, conducted Davis into the dark room&mdash;the curtain ro&s;e, and di&s;covered all the warriors. "Davis was then implicated," &s;ays the Committee, "they then le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t him to his own reflections,"&mdash;but to di&s;regard the puni&s;hment inflicted on innocence, is a new &s;pecies of ju&s;tice, at lea&s;t it is to me.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="035752_0063_1006644A55A077F0">
I now come to the Ca&s;hier again; On the 21&s;t of November the &s;aid Ca&s;hier, inclo&s;ed a bond and warrant of attorney to I&s;aac Davis, drawn in favour of the Pre&s;ident, Directors and Company of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania, for the &s;um of 3,000 dollars, reque&s;ting him to execute the &s;ame, this was intended to &s;ecure &s;ome real e&s;tate he held in the county of Delaware. <HI>Remark,</HI> The Bank have never reflected on their permitting Davis to e&s;cape if they had, it mu&s;t have amounted to &s;elf condemnation: becau&s;e it is here &s;tated, that the Ca&s;hier of the Bank, was in actual corre&s;pondence with him. If Smith &s;ent him a bond on the 21th of November, why did not Smith &s;end for Davis, and &s;ecure him, to be tried by the laws of his country. No, Smith thought he might be too near, I &s;uppo&s;e if he was in Philadelphia. The Committee &s;ay that, "the rob|bery originated with Cunningham, (and pray how &s;hould ihis &s;agacious and all-wi&s;e committee know that it did), who pro|cured the fal&s;e keys, and that he, Davis, does not know who made them."&mdash;<HI>Remark,</HI> The introduction of fal&s;e keys is pretty well laid on, as it &s;erved very well to blind the public. If there were fal&s;e keys made, will any man per&s;uade me Davis did not know who made them. At another &s;itting of the Le|gi&s;lature they go on. "Fir&s;t, That the afore&s;aid Benjamin Bran|non, contrary to the duties of his office; endeavoured to pre|vent a certain I&s;aac Davis from being puni&s;hed, whom he knew had robbed the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania."&mdash;<HI>Remark,</HI> In an&s;wer to this, what did the Bank let him go for, the Bank in my opinion were far more to blame than Brannan. "Secondly, That on the 21&s;t of November la&s;t, Jonathan Smith, E&s;quire, Ca&s;hier of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania, &s;ent a bond to I&s;aac Davis."&mdash;<HI>Remark,</HI> Here Smith (is called an E&s;quire), and for what mortal rea&s;on, or for what de&s;ign, is be&s;t known to the Legi&s;lature them&s;elves. They fir&s;t blame Brannan for preventing Davis from puni&s;hment, and then tell the public that Smith &s;ent a bond to him on the 21&s;t of November: as I ob&s;erved before, why did not Smith &s;end Haines or &s;ome one of a &s;imilar profe&s;&s;ion, and take Davis pri&s;oner, and not lay all the fault on Brannan. The Legi&s;|lature thus continue, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That the &s;aid Benjamin Brannan, called &s;everal times on the Ca&s;hier of the Bank, between the 22&s;t of November, and the 24th of the &s;aid month; and impre&s;&s;ed a belief on the mind of the Ca&s;hier, that I&s;aac Davis would tell who made the picks and keys, &amp;c.&mdash;<HI>Remark,</HI> Does not this appear like an undeniable proof, that Davis mu&s;t have known who made the keys, for Mr. Brannan would not have impre&s;&s;ed

What relates to Mr. Brannan per&s;on|ally, I &s;hall pa&s;s over, as I have no bu&s;ine&s;s with it. I &s;hall now conclude the long detail of this lethargic committee. The committee are of opinion that the Pre&s;ident and Ca&s;hier of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania, for their care&punc; vigilance and exertions, in detecting the robber, and recovering the money &s;tolen from the &s;aid Bank, de&s;erve the highe&s;t commendation.

Having thus fini&s;hed this long hypocritical &s;tory, of either a led-away or uninformed committee: I &s;hall proceed to the names of &s;aid committee, as extracted from the Journals of the Legi&s;lature, and from the following Sections, to wit.</P>

<P>Since I have been out of pri&s;on, I find Mr. Fox has made every enquiry after my &s;ituation; from &s;uch enquiries, if he has been told the truth, I am perfectly ea&s;y: he a&s;ked Mr. Murray, what liquor I was fond of, Mr. Murray an&s;wered, the la&s;t time I called on Mr. Lyon, at his &s;hop, he gave me &s;ome wine and wa|ter to drink.

Mr. Fox in regard to my politics; and as I have vi&s;ited the Bri|ti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons, I &s;hall take the rules, becau&s;e I don't know how they proceed in the Penn&s;ylvania State Legi&s;lature. (Here it is,) And there &s;hall be a cry of Hear him! Hear him! That the alien law in our opinion, (&s;peaking on the principle of political opinion), is of no effect under its denomination, becau&s;e we can under any pretence, (gentlemen), criminate any foreigner, (particularly if he be an ingenious man), and throw him into pri&s;on at plea&s;ure, and particularly if he will not fall down and wor&s;hip the carbuncles that grow upon our no&s;es. You know, (gentlemen), that it is our peculiar de&s;ire to come as near to the Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tem as po&s;&s;ible, for you know, (gentlemen), that the hereditary &s;y&s;tem is the be&s;t for us; becau&s;e we will then get leave to keep all our wi&s;dom to our&s;elves, and to our &s;ons, and our &s;ons, &s;ons: thereby de&s;troying the idle preten&s;ions of the &s;cientific, the learned, and men of genius and talents, and make them bow down their neck to the godde&s;s y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lep'd Ignorance. You know, (gentlemen), the ble&s;&s;ed effects of keeping Lyons in the tower, for in the year of our Lord, ninety and eight, there were two Lyons confined in our great towers, in the Pre&s;idency of John Adams, E&s;quire, (whom God pre&s;erve). You know, (gen|tlemen), that one Lyon was held in bondage, whether for &s;peak|ing the truth or not we do not know, and the other, the younger, becau&s;e he is an ingenious man; and neither of them would fall down and wor&s;hip the carbuncles that grow on our no&s;es. Hear him! Hear him! For it is &s;aid that the Younger &s;aw the light in one of the great cities in the ea&s;t, on the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ion &s;hore, and we have it from good authority, that he is a cunning man, and can work in gold, and in &s;ilver, in bra&s;s, in iron, and in &s;teel; and he can in&s;truct the cunning men of our tribes: moreover it is told to us, (gentlemen), that he is the &s;eventh &s;on of Patrick Lyon, his father, (&s;ince dead of a broken heart), and that he has got what is called the &s;econd &s;ight; for it is further manife&s;ted, that he can tell who is a thief as &s;oon as he has the &s;econd &s;ight, and the great men where our Trea&s;ures are held cannot deny it, for he has given convincing proof of his wi&s;dom. You know, (gentlemen), that they confined him, but he would not fall down and wor&s;hip the carbuncles that grew on their no&s;es. For lo! they kept him forty and eight days in clo&s;e confinement, and all that time without a bed, and &s;ometimes in a &s;tate of &s;tarvation; but the Lord vi&s;ited him in pri&s;on, and &s;trengthened him, and his beard grew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o a con|&s;iderable length; and he was ordered &s;everal times into the

deep dungeon, and &s;till he would not fall down and wor&s;hip the carbuncles that grew upon their no&s;es. There was even an attempt to bring fal&s;e witne&s;s again&s;t him, which grieved his heart, and he was thrown into the ea&s;t wing of the pri&s;on, among&s;t the thieves, and he preached to them and kept the inno|cent heart in good order, and without fear: and he was order|ed to the cells more than thrice, and he went on his way to the cells; but one of the keepers of the tower, who had more humanity than &s;ome of the others, &s;aid, you have done no harm, your pro&s;ecutors have no right to puni&s;h before trial. And his pro&s;ecutors were admitted to fal&s;ely accu&s;e him, and told him in the&s;e words, that he would be confined, tried, and condemn|ed: but his heart was true, he never yielded, and publicly declared that he would not fall down and wor&s;hip the carbun|cles that grew on their no&s;es. Hear him! Hear him! He was kept eight eight weeks in one pair of &s;tockings, he was pre|vented from almo&s;t any communication out of the tower, but he had one friend left, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e was a worker of &s;teel, and his heart was as true, for he declared him&s;elf out of fear, and he was independent of the Scribes and Phara&s;ees, and he would not fall down and wor&s;hip the carbuncles that grew on their no&s;es. The Younger Lyon has likewi&s;e declared, that he will drink <HI>what</HI> he plea&s;es, and <HI>when</HI> he plea&s;es; and is clearly of opinion, that it is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Scribes and Phara&s;ees to in&s;pect into his conduct &s;o minutely: he has publicly de|clared, that he will &s;till adhere to republican principles, and all tho&s;e things he will abide by attendent thereon, and act as is becoming a man in the land of liberty, without licentiou&s;ne&s;s. And be it further known, (gentlemen), that Lyon the Younger was held in bondage during the greate&s;t part of the plague, and he wrote his narrative in the pri&s;on, but it was not &s;uf|fered to go to his coun&s;el, for fear it might do him &s;ome good.

<P>On the 1&s;t of February, 1799, I waited on Mr. Fox, the Pre&s;ident, and I a&s;ked him if they had taken my memorial into con&s;ideration; he &s;aid he had read it, but their reliance was placed on Haines' declaration, and from &s;uch declaration they held them&s;elves in ju&s;tification. I then began to a&s;k Mr. Fox &s;everal que&s;tions, but he would not give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e a direct an&s;wer, and declared off; at the &s;ametime &s;aid he was incapable of talking on the &s;ubject: then entered a &s;trange gentleman, and I left the room. On the &s;ixth of the &s;ame month, I was told by a friend of mine, that Young Brannan made u&s;e of the fol|lowing expre&s;&s;ions, or to that purport, to wit. (That Smith the Ca&s;hier, wi&s;hed I&s;aac Davis to get out of the way, as it would prevent Smith the trouble of finding out who made the fal&s;e keys). On the eighth I found out Young Brannan, and took with me Mr. Condie, the above que&s;tion I put to Young Brannan, but his an&s;wers were eva&s;ive, and he gave it as his opinion, that if there were any fal&s;e keys made, it mu&s;t have been Davis who made them him&s;elf; but my friend &s;till per&s;i&s;ts that the&s;e (as nearly as he po&s;&s;ibly can recollect), were the ex|pre&s;&s;ions Young Brannan made u&s;e of, at the Bull's head, in Strawberry-alley.

Mr. Witherow drew the bill from my books on the 16th of February, and carried the bill to the Bank, which bill was handed to Mr. Fox&mdash;Smith being pre&s;ent, came for|ward and returned Mr. Witherow the bill, and &s;aid that he would di&s;charge the bill, if he, (Mr. Witherow), would deduct the twenty dollars which was &s;ent to Mr. Lyon while in pri&s;on, to which Mr. Witherow replied, that he was not authori&s;ed by Mr. Lyon to deduct any thing from the bill; and therefore mu&s;t take the bill back and receive further orders from Mr. Lyon, before he could &s;ettle it on &s;uch conditions. It is to be ob&s;erved that I never &s;ent for twenty dollars to Mr. Fox or

Mr. Stocker, although they both claimed the merit of the good deed, or ever contracted any debt with them. The twenty dollars which were &s;ent to me, was intended I verily believe as a man trap to catch unwary innocent, and unguarded feel|ings&mdash;Mr. Helm received the twenty dollars, and that he laid it out in nece&s;&s;aries for me, I do not deny; but to give a man a pre&s;ent of twenty dollars, when he was &s;uffering through the negligence of tho&s;e who thru&s;t him there, and then want to &s;top it out of his bill; &s;eems to me one of tho&s;e low, deba&s;ed, mean, and unworthy actions, that would more become the vi|le&s;t of the Jewi&s;h race, than the philanthropic and poli&s;hed brea&s;ts of gentlemen compo&s;ing the body of a commercial and national in&s;titution.</P>
<P>I waited about three weeks, thinking that when the &s;torm awakened in the brea&s;ts of &s;ome of that body again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> might be lulled; that calm con&s;ideration would get over the precipi|tate ebullitions of anger and prejudice, and that they would con&s;ider deliberately what their conduct might appear in the eyes of the world.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked advice from &s;everal profe&s;&s;ional gentlemen, and I was advi&s;ed from the above &s;tatement to &s;ue the Bank of Penn&s;yl|vania before the Alderman's Court. I applied to Squire Jen|nings for the purpo&s;e, but he would not grant me a &s;ummons; but &s;aid he would write a letter to Mr. Fox, to this I had no objection but it &s;truck me in&s;tantly, thus, that if a poor man is indebted, he is &s;ummoned and brought in triumph (to u&s;e a vulgar though common phra&s;e) up to the bull-ring; however Mr. Fox, did not like to di&s;pute this ground, he &s;ent the mo|ney to Squire Jennings and I gave a receipt for the &s;ame to prevent any farther expo&s;ition of the Bank. I &s;till had an idea that I could have brought an action of damages for fal&s;e impri&s;onment, and waited on &s;everal gentlemen of the law, and which co&s;t me a con&s;iderable &s;um; but I could find none that would en&s;ure me any &s;ucce&s;s, from the following ob&s;ervations of theirs. Fir&s;t I was held to bail and if I brought an action again&s;t the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania it mu&s;t be tried at the Su|preme Court, and it would come on before the very Jud|ges&punc; which held me to bail&punc; and that would be a countermand of their judgment if they even countenanced my action. Se|cond, The trial mu&s;t come before the &s;ame Court and it is mo&s;t probable the Jury which would be impannelled would be men intere&s;ted in the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania: under tho&s;e two heads they could not give me any encouragement to bring

the action forward. It is ea&s;y to hold a man to bail providing the pro&s;ecutor can tell a tough &s;tory and when a Jury is kept under the thumb of a Bank the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is &s;ettled without either regard to law or ju&s;tice. I have applied to the late mayor's brother Mr. Baker, for all the papers re&s;pecting the robbery of the Bank, or a copy of them which were in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the late Hillary Baker: but his brother tells me Mr. Fox holds them, and I have been &s;ince told by the watchmen that the above papers are in the hands of Billy Sansom, I &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e glad to know what bu&s;ine&s;s Mr. Fox, or Billy San&s;om, has to retain papers which ought ab&s;olutely to be in the of|fice of the mayor for in&s;pection: I &s;hould have been glad to have had copies of them, at lea&s;t Samuel Wheeler's, depo|&s;ition which was either ignorant, fal&s;e, or <HI>malicious,</HI> according to my conception. The Bank of Penn&s;ylvania was very much di&s;appointed, and the va&s;t expence that they were at with me, I &s;uppo&s;e made them more inveterate again&s;t me. They rode after John Boyd, a Brick-layer, near forty miles into We&s;t-Che&s;ter, to be an evidence again&s;t me, and when they got John Boyd he did not know me. I am &s;ure I did not know him at that time, but we have &s;ince became acquainted and he has related to me the whole of that part of the farce. I now return to Haines, the con&s;table or catchpole, or what you will. I am &s;orry for neglecting &s;o amiable a character &s;o long&mdash;when he got his orders to go to the Capes after me, he was told by &s;everal of my Friends, that I was gone to Cape Henlopen; but in place of going there, he went into the Jer&s;ey, and down to Cape May. I have the &s;tory from captain John Car&s;in's mother, who was about that time a neighbour of mine, and a better woman is not in the circle of my acquaintance. Haines fell in with this old lady at Cape May, but unfortunately for him, &s;he was well acquainted with me and my family concerns; and would not allow Haines to advance any fal&s;e repre&s;entations again&s;t me: It was not only the erroneous accu&s;ation of the Bank of Penn&s;ylvania again&s;t me; but Haines mu&s;t have vi&s;ited Rebecca Barker, or &s;ome of her companions; &s;he being under the denomination of my mo|ther-in-law. I only lay &s;uch ca&s;es down, to find what rational man can place confidence in &s;uch reptiles&mdash;&s;uch women are a di&s;grace to the mode&s;t &s;ex, and &s;erves as another in&s;tance of my belief, that there are not too great a number of men can boa&s;t of a good mother-in-law. Haines, when at Cape May was told that I went into a tavern, and called for &s;omething to
<PB N="72" REF="035752_0071_1006645A23FC6AE8">
drink; and looked over the new&s;paper; and as &s;oon as I had read the paper, drank off the liquor in a hurry, and went into a cedar &s;wamp, and &s;et fire to it in two different places. God knows I never was at Cape May in my life. Haines and the high-con|&s;table of Cape May, (a pair of worthies), cut down from &s;ome of the large trees, two clubs, and like the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">in brother giants, Gog and Magog, i&s;&s;ued forth on a wild goo&s;e chace into the cedar &s;wamp; but the a&s;&s;es could find no Lyon. For Saul was &s;ent after his father's a&s;&s;es, but could not find them, and then was declared wi&s;e enough to be a king; but if a&s;&s;es can't find a Lyon what is their wi&s;dom entitled to. Haines did not go to look for a brother, he went out to look for a Lyon, the king of the bea&s;ts, and he could not find him; and the king of the bea&s;ts thinks it a very great hard&s;hip, that he &s;hould be hunted after, by one of the meane&s;t, lowe&s;t, and mo&s;t deba&s;ed of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>I have related the nature of the Philadelphia pri&s;on in &s;e|veral parts of this work; the advocates of which, cannot be|lieve that &s;uch treatment is exerci&s;ed on the pri&s;oners, in any part of the pri&s;on; but the&s;e people that will not believe that the Philadelphia pri&s;on is as bad as any other pri&s;on, that is to be read of, my only wi&s;h is, that they may have a fair and &s;peedy trial of it: it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;ay the&s;e unbelieving advocates, that any man can be twenty-four hours without a mor&s;el. When it can be proved, that a pri&s;oner &s;ome time back, was &s;tarved and disfigured by the rats; and I &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e advocates can|not deny that a keeper cannot at plea&s;ure take the unfortunate women out of the we&s;t-wing, and keep them in the cells&mdash;for what purpo&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e may be ea&s;ily gue&s;&s;ed at. A man taken to the cells for God knows what, &s;ometimes at the re|que&s;t of his pro&s;ecutor, or per&s;ecutor, I cannot &s;ay which, for they are &s;ynonimous; and kept &s;everal months on half a pound of bread, and a quart of water every 24 hours, until he is &s;o weak that he has been known to knaw the plai&s;ter from the walls, and could not &s;tand to evacuate his urine.

I &s;ay no pri&s;oner has a right to be put to the cells by the orders of the pro&s;ecutor, or pro&s;ecutors, to extort any thing from him, or to &s;atisfy their &s;avage barbarity: why rail at the rack or the inqui&s;ition, if &s;imilar methods are pur&s;ued, to ex|tort

</LETTER>
<P><HI>Ob&s;ervation.</HI> When the Bank was robbed, from what I can learn; Smith, Davis, and Robin&s;on, were all in triangled &s;i|tuations. Davis at Brannan's table, would frequently &s;ay at dinner, I wi&s;h they could catch the thieves: Smith at Ger|mantown, and Robin&s;on in the &s;tate of New-Jer&s;ey; but they all &s;ung the &s;ame tune, to be &s;ure Lyon mu&s;t be the man, and if this one will take him, or that one will take him, there will be three thou&s;and dollars for you. Then &s;ome got guns, and &s;ome got pi&s;tols, and &s;ome got &s;words, and &s;ome got clubs, (and off to the &s;wamps). Such a continued race of warriors never exi&s;ted before, only in the chimerical brain of the famed Knight of La Mancha, when he attacked the flocks of &s;heep, and had his teeth knocked out by the &s;hepherds.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="035752_0073_1006645F4D881C80">
The opinion of many in regard to Davis, runs in this kind of language, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That Davis was a great rogue but bigger fool; a rogue fir&s;t for robbing the Bank, and a fool for not being more careful in pre&s;erving the ca&s;h when he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But the Bank, or the public at large, will accept of my opinion, (it is this): Fir&s;t, I &s;ay that if Davis took the money, he was wrong, for no man has a right to take that which does not be|long to him. Second, If Davis ever &s;uffered him&s;elf to be made a tool for other people's private purpo&s;es, he certainly mu&s;t be granted a fool without redemption, in my poor hum|ble opinion: becau&s;e this affair is not yet developed to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ld, or in what manner this Bank was robbed, and which &s;till remains a my&s;tery. I &s;ay it appears to me, as if &s;ome people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be plea&s;ed the whole &s;hould be buried in oblivion, with|out the funereal farewel of a whi&s;per.</P>
<P>It has been reported that the Bank offered me different &s;ums of money, and that I had made a certain demand: I declare to the public, the Bank never came forward, nor did I ever make any demand. If they are clo&s;ely interrogated, it is an&s;wered by a fetch or come off, &s;uch as, there are &s;till &s;ome doubts, &amp;c. about it. Some relate one &s;tory, and another a different one, as nearly an&s;wers the purpo&s;e for which it is &s;poken. Where is then &s;uch an in&s;tance? Can the Hi&s;tories of different nations furni&s;h you with &s;uch <HI>a refined in|&s;tance of cruelty,</HI> and &s;uch poli&s;hed combination of man, &s;ty|ling them&s;elves gentlemen, and re&s;iding in a free Chri&s;tian coun|try, (I mean to &s;elect tho&s;e for my ob&s;ervation only, as were the cau&s;e of my &s;ufferings) as tho&s;e I unfortunately had to deal with, but &s;uch an in&s;tance of cruelty is not to be for|gotten, if forgiven on this &s;ide of the grave, whatever may be the con&s;equences on the other. If the equilibrium is de&s;troyed between man and man, the aggre&s;&s;or &s;hould give to the injured the Balance due in his favour, and give back to the injured every atom of his due; but no, &s;ay the&s;e gentlemen, we publicly de|clare we will puni&s;h him, and bring him down, never more to behold the glorious luminary of Heaven: and clo&s;e his eyes in terre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tial darkne&s;s. I only a&s;k if it would not have been more humane, of tho&s;e gentlemen, to have come to the pri&s;on, and have taken me by the hand and humanely as London merchants certainly would have done&mdash;pride, ignorance, or indolence, or all, may have carried them farther than they expected. And their keeping me in pri&s;on nearly three weeks, after the money
<PB N="75" REF="035752_0074_10066462006EE2B8">
was found, &s;erved only to blind the public, into their mea&s;ures at that time; but at pre&s;ent I have the plea&s;ure to inform tho&s;e gentlemen, and the committee for whom I have &s;o great a re|gard, (on account of their deci&s;ion &s;o well frought with Solo|monic wi&s;dom), that it has been my chief &s;tudy to fulfil the &s;tation which I believe nature intended me for, in, and on all my tran&s;actions in life. A di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s which has been often an injury to me, but which I have invariably pur&s;ued in &s;pight of the fal&s;e &s;hew, glare, glitter, and &s;plendour of the world: an open plaine&s;s, and hone&s;t bluntne&s;s of &s;peech, which as my feelings dictated: were involuntarily &s;poken. The&s;e are plea&s;ant, &s;oothing reflections to me, they quiet the corroding irk&s;omene&s;s of care, and give a delicious compo&s;ure at night to the wearied body. And when tho&s;e gentlemen, who are &s;o great in the world's eye, leave this world and the bell tolls their funereal knell, honours they cannot rationally boa&s;t of, and all their grand &s;peculations die with them: while on the other hand, my works will be durable and ornamental, and probably my works and my principles, may not &s;o &s;oon be forgotten, as tho&s;e of the gentlemen above alluded to.</P>
<P>I do not know a better country or part of a country in the world than Penn&s;ylvania for people to die in, and get a good po&s;thumous name: for if he who dies, has practi&s;ed &s;windling, u&s;ury, and every other vice, within the pale of the law; he is &s;ure to be a good patriot, an indulgent hu&s;band, a kind father, with a variety of other innumerable virtues. If a woman, hack|nied in all the meretricious arts and failings of her &s;ex: &s;he is every thing that is le&s;s than a &s;aint, and prai&s;ed with more vir|tues than ever belonged to a mortal of either &s;ex: but news|paper prai&s;e, for the dead, ought to be valued at the price of old rags, being ju&s;t as cheap, and of equal worth.</P>
<P>To &s;um up the whole, if any inaccuracies have crept into this work: I hope I &s;hall be forgiven, as I am more accu&s;tomed to mechanics than to author&s;hip: but I hope I have as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, kept the undeviating path of truth, and while &s;he re|mains my mi&s;tre&s;s, I have not the lea&s;t doubt, but this will meet with the approbation of my fellow Citizens,</P>
