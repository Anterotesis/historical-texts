<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT is thought nece&s;&s;ary to inform the Reader that a &s;ermon preceded this, from Matthew</HI> xvi. 27. For the Son of Man &s;hall come in the glory of his Father, with his holy Angels, and then &s;hall he reward every man according to his works.&mdash;<HI>In this di&s;cour&s;e, the particular object was to &s;hew, that all our conduct, in every relation in life, will peculiarly intere&s;t and concern us, at the final Judgment. The relation between Mini&s;ters and their People, was particularly con&s;idered; the object of the Head of the Church in the appointment of them; their accountablene&s;s to Him, in the di&s;charge of their office; the obligation of the People to attend to the true Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t; and that Chri&s;t now views, and will, at the day of Judgment, treat the con|duct of People toward faithful Mini&s;ters, as conduct toward him&s;elf, agreeably to his own declaration, "He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that &s;ent me; and he that di&s;pi&s;eth you, di&s;pi&s;eth me; and he that di&s;pi&s;eth me, di&s;pi&s;eth him that &s;ent me: He that will not re|ceive you, nor hear your word, it &s;hall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorra<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the day of Judgment, than for him." The&s;e &s;ketches are gi|ven, becau&s;e reference is had to this di&s;cour&s;e in the Addre&s;&s;es in the following Sermon, and in other parts of it al&s;o, as will be &s;een by the reader.</HI></P>

<P>THE Author hath no expectation that this Sermon will affect the minds of Readers as it did tho&s;e who heard it, as that was a peculiar oc|ca&s;ion. His apology for allowing it to be pub|li&s;hed, is, that a number of the hearers wi&s;hed to have it in their hou&s;es.

<BIBL>2 CORINTHIANS, xiii. II.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Finally, brethren, farewell; be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of Love and Peace &s;hall be with you.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE apo&s;tle Paul, in the cour&s;e of his tra|vels, came to Corinth, and there he preach|ed the go&s;pel about &s;ix years before he wrote this la&s;t epi&s;tle to them. At that time he tarried among them about a year and an half. During this vi&s;it, many who heard him, believed, and turned from their idols to the &s;ervice of the true God, and embraced the glorious go&s;pel of his Son: The happy effects of his mini&s;try among them through the ble&s;&s;ing of God, greatly endear|ed them to each other. After having been ab|&s;ent from them about five years, and having in this time heard of things in their conduct contrary to the &s;pirit of the Go&s;pel, and being likewi&s;e reque&s;ted by them in a letter to him, to an&s;wer &s;ome particular que&s;tions; he embraces an opportunity amid&s;t all his oth|er cares, to write to them, with a manife&s;t de|&s;ign to correct their errors, to lead them further into the knowlege of true chri&s;tianity, and to an|&s;wer their que&s;tions. The next year he wrote them this mo&s;t feeling and &s;piritual epi&s;tle which
<PB N="6" REF="035495_0005_1004E0500ECE4498">
contains our text: the&s;e two epi&s;tles contain more than he wrote to any other church. It appears that the church at Corinth was peculiarly on the mind of the apo&s;tle, and that he had &s;pent much time and care for them; but in this epi&s;tle he clo&s;es his &s;ervices among them, and takes his leave.</P>
<P>Tho the church at Corinth, in general, highly e&s;teemed the apo&s;tle, yet he had his enemies; who, tho they acknowleged him great and pow|erful in rea&s;oning, yet di&s;liked his per&s;onal ap|pearance, and to whom his &s;peech was contemp|ible, as appears from this epi&s;tle. It is evident that this church had &s;ome members unfriendly to the doctrines, the &s;pirit, and practice of the go&s;|pel; for the apo&s;tle charges them with being guil|ty of &s;uch fornication, as far exceeded what was even named among the gentiles; that one &s;hould have his father's wife&mdash;that they were al&s;o carnal, &s;elfi&s;h, and contentious; that one was for Paul, another for Apollos, &amp;c. all which proved them de&s;titute of the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel. Their con|duct <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;acrament was much to the di&s;honor of the go&s;pel, and incon&s;i&s;tent not only with he &s;obriety and purity of the chri&s;tian religion and its holy and &s;olemn in&s;titutions, but even contra|ry to common decency, that one &s;hould be hun|gry, and another drunken, at this religious &s;o|lemnity.</P>
<P>One rea&s;on why there were &s;o many in&s;incere profe&s;&s;ors at Corinth, while the go&s;pel was gener|ally unpopular, may probably be, that Cri&s;pus the chief ruler of the &s;ynagogue believed, and all his hou&s;e, and al&s;o one Gous; the&s;e, and other im|portant
<PB N="7" REF="035495_0006_1004E051D6796330">
characters rendered it popular to profe&s;s chri&s;tianity at Corinth, tho it was not the ca&s;e in other places.</P>
<P>It was in vain for the&s;e enemies of Paul, pub|licly to oppo&s;e his doctrines, or to impeach his moral character: they mu&s;t then u&s;e &s;uch wea|pons again&s;t him as they could find. In &s;eeking for objections, nothing could be found for open attack, but the meer defects of nature. He was not a man of a &s;tately and commanding vi&s;age, nor a good &s;peaker. His letters, &s;ay they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily pre&s;ence is weak, and his &s;peech contemptible. Such public clamor is often popular with the un&s;table, irreli|gious, and incon&s;iderate part of mankind; and is frequently a &s;tronger objection again&s;t a mini&s;ter, in the mind of many, than herecy, or immorality; for neither of the latter are &s;o contrary to the un|&s;anctified heart. Though this clamor might tend to hinder the &s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;pel at Corinth; yet it did not alter the opinions and feelings of the really religious and di&s;cerning chri&s;tians, con|cerning the apo&s;tle. They con&s;idered &s;uch ob|jections as groundle&s;s cavils, and the fruits of an unfriendly mind to the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Whether the&s;e or other rea&s;ons operated to prevent the apo&s;tle from further particular atten|tion, care, and labor among the Corinthians, does not appear. It is evident he lived, at lea&s;t, a|bout &s;ix years after he wrote this la&s;t epi&s;tle, as a laborer in the vineyard of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Whatever might be his rea&s;ons, it is clear he felt him&s;elf warranted in cea&s;ing his particular attention to them; and therefore in the clo&s;e of
<PB N="8" REF="035495_0007_1004E056C34C19D8">
this epi&s;tle, and particularly in the words of our text, he takes leave of them. It appears from his epi&s;tles, that he dearly and tenderly regarded the real friends of Je&s;us; and tho he de&s;pi&s;ed the cavils of the&s;e fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ors, yet he wi&s;hed their good, and &s;incerely pitied tho&s;e who might, in|cautiou&s;ly, be ruined by their means.</P>
<P>Far would I be from comparing my&s;elf with this great apo&s;tle, as a man in&s;pired, or as being his equal, in natural abilities or real graces; but in unequal characters, there may be &s;ome like|ne&s;s in circum&s;tantial things. How far the &s;uc|ce&s;s the apo&s;tle in the beginning of his preach|ing at Corinth and &s;ome things which happened after, and have now been mentioned, may com|pare with what hath taken place among us &s;ince my &s;ettlement among this people, I &s;hall leave to the judgment of the candid, and acquainted.</P>
<P>In the words of our text the apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es his good will and &s;incere de&s;ire for the pro&s;perity of that church, which, under God, he had labor|ed to erect, and build up on the plan of the go&s;|pel.</P>
<P>We are not to &s;uppo&s;e the apo&s;tle intended by this phra&s;e a mere parting compliment without much meaning, as at this day is become cu&s;tom|ary: to &s;hew his meaning and real de&s;ire that they might fare well in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;en&s;e, he not on|ly joins with it the friendly term of brethren, but al&s;o exhibits before them the way to farewell in the highe&s;t degree po&s;&s;ible. As the way to this felicity he exhorteth them to be perfect, to be of good comfort, to be of one mind, and to live in peace; with this a&s;&s;urance, that in &s;o doing, the
<PB N="9" REF="035495_0008_1004E05B9ED1BD70">
God of love and peace, the infinite fountain of good, would be with them.</P>
<P>Perfection intends holine&s;s of heart, and of life, and a &s;trict and con&s;tant walk with God, accord|ing to the command of the glorious go&s;pel.</P>
<P>To be of good comfort, is not to &s;ink, and be di&s;heartened at the dark and gloomy &s;cenes which might happen; but in the exerci&s;e of true holi|ne&s;s and vital piety to God, and benevolence to men; they &s;hould place their hope, their tru&s;t, and confidence, in the all powerful care and pro|tection of that God, who is ever mindful of them that rely on him, that they &s;hould be comforted. In a view of God's con&s;tant care of his cau&s;e, and of his people, and the unfailing interce&s;&s;ion and wi&s;e government of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is head over all things to his church; and who is able to de|feat all the devices of the enemies of his people, and to give them a glorious and compleat victory at la&s;t, who tru&s;t in him for &s;alvation; that look|ing unto Je&s;us the great captain of &s;alvation, and the mighty conqueror, they might be &s;ure of vic|tory at la&s;t, however dark and critical their pre|&s;ent circum&s;tances might appear.</P>
<P>He further recommends to them union and onene&s;s of mind, both in faith and practice, tow|ard God and men; that they &s;hould be united in the faith and fellow-&s;hip of the go&s;pel; that they might not be rent by divi&s;ions and di&s;&s;en|tions, and &s;o be expo&s;ed to the ravages of the en|emies of God, and of his people; but that they &s;hould be united in love to God, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the fellow-&s;hip of the &s;pirit; as union in the truth, is the great bulwork of the church again&s;t the in|roads
<PB N="10" REF="035495_0009_1004E05D240DBC80">
of the adver&s;ary. He exhorts them there|fore to lay a&s;ide contention, to &s;tudy and &s;eek for peace and love in the truth, by all proper conde&s;cention one to the other, which could be con&s;i&s;tent with the religion of the benevolent go&s;|pel, of the meek, the lowly and conde&s;cending Je&s;us; that they &s;hould ever &s;hun and guard a|gain&s;t an inclination too common among profe&s;&s;|ing chri&s;tians to di&s;agree; that they &s;hould be a|greed in every thing, in faith and practice, and &s;o e&s;cape contention, and party opinion, and par|ty zeal; that in lowline&s;s, in humblene&s;s of mind, in charity, and tenderne&s;s towards each other, and the truth, they &s;hould &s;eek to know the will of God, and the path of duty, and in this way &s;trive together for the promotion of the glory of God, the good of his kingdom, and the mutual benefit of each other, and the good of the whole body; and that they might all be one in Chri&s;t, and be perfectly joined together in the &s;ame mind and in the &s;ame judgment, and become one body in Chri&s;t the glorious head of all principality and power.</P>
<P>In this way he a&s;&s;ures them that they might ex|pect to be unconquerable, by any of the arts and devices of the adver&s;ary, and might expect that their united prayers would con&s;tantly a&s;cend to heaven with full acceptance; and that God by his &s;pirit would continually dwell in and among them, and that he would be as a wall of fire round about them, and the glory in the mid&s;t of them.</P>
<P>In the&s;e directions the apo&s;tle compri&s;es all religion, both of faith and practice, in a mo&s;t feeling manner; and al&s;o the &s;um of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s
<PB N="11" REF="035495_0010_1004E05EC22B7738">
that &s;hall attend it; and this was of high import|ance to the church at Corinth, con&s;idering their danger, both from &s;ome of their own body, who appeared evidently not to be real friends to the doctrines and duties of the go&s;pel, and al&s;o from a frowning world around them; and I may add, that it was e&s;pecially needful to them, as they were now to be denied the aid of that great apo&s;|tle for their guide.</P>
<P>But it is proper that we come to a more parti|cular application of what has been &s;aid this day, and e&s;pecially on the particular occa&s;ion and cir|cum&s;tances of My&s;elf, and the Church and Peo|ple in this Society.</P>
<P>In this place, allow me to refre&s;h your minds with a very brief recital of &s;ome things, which have taken place in the cour&s;e of my mini&s;try:&mdash;You will then recollect, that fourteen years la&s;t January, I was, in compliance with the unani|mous voice and de&s;ire of this church and &s;ociety, &s;olemnly &s;et apart, and took upon me the care and charge of them as their Pa&s;tor. At this time it was at lea&s;t implied, that we &s;olemnly engaged, before our God, to di&s;charge the duties of a Mi|ni&s;ter and People in the fear of God, and as tho&s;e who mu&s;t give account, before his Bar, at the Great Day.</P>
<P>We then began that important relation, exhi|bited in the forenoon, and which mu&s;t occa&s;ion us a mo&s;t &s;olemn meeting at the Tribunal of God, in the pre&s;ence of an a&s;&s;embled univer&s;e, to ac|count to him for the di&s;charge of our duty, in this relation.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="035495_0011_1004E063AABCCBC0">
Soon after the&s;e mutual engagements, it plea&s;|ed God of his infinite kindne&s;s to pour upon us his &s;pirit, to call up the attention of many &s;ecure &s;inners, and hopefully to bring home a number of &s;ouls to the knowlege and acknowlegement of the truth; joy filled the hearts of the friends of God among us.</P>
<P>At this time I found it ea&s;y, tho very labori|ous, to di&s;charge the duties of the mini&s;try. Of this delightful and happy time for nearly two years, many here pre&s;ent are living witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>At the decline of the&s;e joyful and laborious days, to me, another and very different &s;cene commenced; and tho it le&s;&s;ened my calls for fre|quent preaching, public conferences, and private in&s;tructions of a &s;piritual kind; yet it was a far more trouble&s;ome and difficult ta&s;k to do my du|ty, to my own &s;ati&s;faction, and that of the people, than the other. This troubled my mind, it &s;unk and di&s;heartened my &s;pirits. Tho the matters fir&s;t agitated were mo&s;tly &s;mall in them&s;elves, yet they manife&s;tly led to tho&s;e which were material.</P>
<P>I was much di&s;couraged when I found we could not think alike in tho&s;e matters; and more e&s;pe|cially was this the ca&s;e with me, after repeatedly urging for a mutual council, which was utterly rejected; for this I &s;uppo&s;ed, and &s;till conceive, was the only way to compo&s;e our difficulties; and &s;uch a council, I am now per&s;uaded, would &s;oon have convinced us of our duty, and pointed out the path in which we might have gone in peace and harmony to this day.</P>
<P>In a view of the&s;e matters, at their fir&s;t begin|ing, I think the word of St. James may well be
<PB N="13" REF="035495_0012_1004E06656EBFB20">
applied: "Behold what a matter a little fire kindleth."</P>
<P>In a view of the difficulties attending a di&s;|charge of my duty as a mini&s;ter for eight years pa&s;t, (in my private meditation&s;) I have often had the &s;ubject of the forenoon; the judgment of the great day croud it&s;elf forcibly on my mind, with regard to my&s;elf and you my brethren and hear|ers, and have been frequently led to think, whe|ther it was not much to be de&s;ired that our &s;o|lemn relation to each other (tho va&s;tly impor|tant in its nature) &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved. This hath once and again induced me to bring this &s;ubject before this church and &s;ociety.</P>
<P>But God's time is always the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Providence has now brought the event to pa&s;s, but not without our exertions; and probably, not without great blame to &s;ome, if not the mo&s;t of us.</P>
<P>I am far from claiming perfection to my&s;elf; nor did I ever pretend to be a chri&s;tian of high attainments in grace or holine&s;s; tho for thirty-&s;ix years, I have had an hope that I had pa&s;&s;ed the new birth; and tho I have ever hoped, yet I have often feared. I feel that I depend on the &s;overeign mercy and grace of God, in Chri&s;t, and on the holy Spirit, to carry on and compleat in me, that which I hope is begun. This is all my expectation of a glorious immortality.</P>
<P>I can freely &s;ay, that in my days of trouble, I have on &s;ome occa&s;ions been more di&s;turbed and agitated in mind, than my cooler judgment after|wards dictated. I think, however, I can with truth &s;ay, I have not wi&s;hed nor &s;ought real evil
<PB N="14" REF="035495_0013_1004E067DBCA5D58">
to this people, nor to an individual; but rather their be&s;t, their eternal good.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t &s;ay al&s;o, that in my hours of reflection, on matters that have pa&s;&s;ed, I have not been con|vinced, of having taken the wrong &s;ide of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I think it my duty, further, to &s;ay on this oc|ca&s;ion, that the doctrines and duties I have taught you, my brethren and friends, are tho&s;e by which we mu&s;t &s;tand or fall before our Judge at the great day; at which time let us remember we mu&s;t have a mo&s;t &s;olemn meeting: and O that God of his infinite mercy would grant, that it may be joyful to us all, through his &s;pirit and grace attending us, in our future lives, and by the glo|rious atonement of his Son the Judge.</P>
<P>At your reque&s;t I have re&s;igned that &s;acred charge and care of your &s;ouls, which once I took upon me, by your unanimous de&s;ire; &s;uppo&s;ing this choice of yours, and the deci&s;ion of a mutu|al council, render it proper and ju&s;tifiable before my God.</P>
<P>It being your reque&s;t that I &s;hould in this pub|lic way take my leave of you, allow me to clo&s;e by a few addre&s;&s;es; the fir&s;t of which will be to this church:</P>

<P>When fir&s;t I took the pa&s;toral charge of this Church, the whole number was twenty-nine. The mo&s;t of tho&s;e who were the founders and pil|lars of this Church, now &s;leep in du&s;t. In the cour&s;e of my mini&s;try, ninety-three have been added; and a large number of the&s;e, have ob|tained
<PB N="15" REF="035495_0014_1004E06977081E98">
an hope of renewing grace, under my mi|ni&s;try. The&s;e have in time pa&s;t acknowleged me (under God) their &s;piritual father and guide. Whatever may be their pre&s;ent feelings with re&s;|pect to me, if they are not deceived in their hope, I <HI>tru&s;t</HI> they will again acknowledge me at the great day, and that I &s;hall yet have them by their free con&s;ent as &s;eals of my mini&s;try, and crowns of my rejoicing before God.</P>
<P>As I leave you, at your own choice, it is na|tural to &s;uppo&s;e you e&s;teem it a privilege, and not a lo&s;s. That it is to the promotion of your good that this &s;hould take place, you cannot therefore expect that I &s;hall have that peculiar anxiety for you on this event, as if you con&s;idered it to your injury, or if it had happened contrary to your minds. If any &s;hould con&s;ider this as an occa|&s;ion of rejoicing, I would not wi&s;h unnece&s;&s;arily to di&s;turb their feelings; Yet in faithfulne&s;s to God, and your &s;ouls, and to the good of Chri&s;t's kingdom among you, in future, I think it my du|ty to tell you, you are as &s;heep without a &s;hep|herd; and if it be better than while I was your pa&s;tor, yet it is &s;till a dangerous &s;tate, and hath ever been found to be &s;uch, in every age of the church, and is con&s;idered &s;uch by the great Head of the church; and an in&s;en&s;ibility of it greatly increa&s;eth the danger. If you would &s;upport the character of a real Church of the Glorious Re|deemer, let me tell you, your troubles are not likely to end this day. I think my&s;elf &s;o well ac|quainted with the &s;tate of this Church, and the re|ligious &s;tate of our land, as to fore&s;ee you are in danger from every quarter. Within, you are

expo&s;ed by at lea&s;t the remains of an evil heart, by which means, when you would do good, evil will be pre&s;ent with you. Want of a thorough knowlege of the path of duty may al&s;o expo&s;e you to go a&s;tray. A &s;ubtle adver&s;ary who will appear in almo&s;t every &s;hape will be&s;et you: at times he will appear as an angel of light, full of love and zeal for religion, with &s;ome fatal error under a &s;ecret cover: at other times he will bold|ly attack &s;ome e&s;&s;ential and fundamental truth, to which, for want of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to defend, many of you may fall a prey.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t, to be faithful, tell you that many fal&s;e teachers, flatterers, corruptors of the word of God, and men plea&s;ers, are gone out into the world, of whom let me be&s;eech you, beware; for in your de&s;titute &s;tate, you will be apt to be in|fe&s;ted with the&s;e intruders.</P>
<P>Let me then, my brethren, recommend to you the holy Scriptures for your con&s;tant guide; and intreat you earne&s;tly and &s;incerely, to look to the great head of the church for his &s;pirit to lead you into a clear di&s;cernment and true under&s;tand|ing of his holy word, and that he would prepare your hearts, readily and con&s;tantly, to keep and do all things which he hath commanded: com|mit your&s;elves, as individuals and as a church, to God's holy and con&s;tant a&s;&s;i&s;tance and direc|tion; implore his con&s;tant pre&s;ence and care over you, and lean not to your own under&s;tanding and &s;ufficiency. You need to be con&s;tantly on your guard, and much on your knees, before God, for his con&s;tant protection, to &s;ecure you from the errors and mi&s;chiefs to which you are
<PB N="17" REF="035495_0016_1004E06FE2F53BE8">
expo&s;ed, in this evil day, and that it may plea&s;e the lord of the harve&s;t, to &s;end you a pa&s;tor after his own heart, and that one of an oppo&s;ite cha|racter may not be impo&s;ed on you. In a word, take the direction of the great apo&s;tle to the Co|rinthians, be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and may the God of Love and Peace be with you: and when the chief Shepherd &s;hall appear, may we meet our glorious Lord and final Judge with acceptance.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friends, once the People of my Charge.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As you have made no public prefe&s;&s;ion of real religion, I tru&s;t you will not be offended if I &s;hould in this addre&s;s &s;peak to you as imperti|nent, and as having no &s;pecial intere&s;t at pre&s;ent in the &s;alvation of the go&s;pel. Many of you have been particularly kind to me; from whom I have received many favors, and for whom I have ever had, and &s;till have, a very tender regard.</P>
<P>I am now to take my leave of you as your guide in your &s;piritual and eternal concerns. It &s;en&s;ibly affects me on this occa&s;ion, that my pa&s;t labours have, to appearance, been without &s;aving benefit to your precious and immortal &s;ouls; that after all, I mu&s;t leave you as I found you, with regard to your eternal &s;alvation. With re&s;pect to &s;ome of you, according to the cour&s;e of na|ture, your gla&s;s is almo&s;t run; only a few &s;catter|ing
<PB N="18" REF="035495_0017_1004E071AD3643B8">
and doubtful &s;ands remain. That I mu&s;t leave you is decided: but how &s;hall I leave you thus? how can I take my leave of you in this your condition; to meet you hereafter, O dread|ful thought! on the left hand of the final Judge? to have tho&s;e truths which you have heard from me, bear witne&s;s again&s;t you at the great tribunal! O my friends, think on the &s;cenes before you; think on your pre&s;ent condition, and on that of your families, your dear children, who&s;e preci|ous and immortal &s;ouls, as well as your own, &s;hould be your &s;pecial care. Think on your pre&s;ent &s;tate, as &s;inners, and the &s;ubject of the endle&s;s cur&s;e of God's law. Think on the glori|ous go&s;pel, which brings &s;alvation to every true penitent. Think on the &s;hort and uncertain time of your probation and opportunity of obtaining pardon, and the favor of God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Realize the final judgment to your&s;elves, and the eternity to follow. Let the&s;e &s;ubjects ever be al|lowed a place in your minds, and in your hearts. I may&mdash;I am allowed this once, as the la&s;t time, to warn and invite you to be reconciled to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t: "Behold then to day, after &s;o long time, as it is &s;aid, to day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts." Now then my friends, let religion be your great, your chief con|cern, in what of your lives remain, that &s;o our meeting at la&s;t, before the tribunal of our final Judge, may be joyful and happy. Realize the religion of the clo&s;et, the family, and the hou&s;e of God. Remember that without repentance you will die in your &s;ins, though I &s;hould be found to have been unfaithful as a watchman;
<PB N="19" REF="035495_0018_1004E0734DD66B60">
and let me add, that I am confident the way I have endeavored to point out, and urge your compliance with, is that which at the great day of God, you will find, the only way of acceptance before his throne. In a view of the&s;e truths, and your duty, and in expectation of a mo&s;t &s;olemn meeting with you at the great tribunal, and hav|ing no longer a right, as your pa&s;tor, to urge the&s;e things upon you, and it being your voice that it &s;hould be thus, I bid you, in this relation, a final Farewell.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY YOUNG FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Travellers to judgment and eternity, hear and receive the la&s;t addre&s;s of him who wi&s;hes the &s;alvation of your immortal &s;ouls. Many have been my hours of &s;orrow at your apparent un|concern for religion, and your own eternal &s;tate. Will you &s;ay I have not faithfully taught and warned you? In reply let me a&s;k you to reflect on what I have taught you from this &s;acred de&s;k. Let con&s;cience an&s;wer. Is it through my negli|gence or yours, that you have no clearer view of God and Divine things on your minds, and no more concern for his honor and the &s;alvation of your &s;ouls? <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the doctrines and duties I have taught, &s;uch as the holy &s;criptures <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">? and have they not been urged upon you as things of the highe&s;t concern? Hath my life and con|ver&s;ation ju&s;tly led you to conceive religion of no importance to mankind? Or have I, in the
<PB N="20" REF="035495_0019_1004E07834AE7B10">
cour&s;e of my mini&s;try, been peculiarly inatten|tive to the young? If this be the opinion of any, let me inform you, that my &s;ermons, if examined, will &s;hew, that the youth have been often parti|cularly addre&s;&s;ed on the important concerns of religion and their &s;ouls. A meeting al&s;o for the purpo&s;e of in&s;tructing the youth, particularly in religion, was in&s;tituted &s;oon after my &s;ettlement, which proved very u&s;eful to many, and was con|tinued until it was neglected or mis-improved, &s;o as to he thought, both by my&s;elf and others, be&s;t it &s;hould be di&s;continued. I mention the&s;e things in a brief manner, to &s;hew you that the youth have not been forgotten by me.</P>
<P>As, my young friends, you are con&s;idered in favor of my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and as being di&s;&s;uited with me; if this be the ca&s;e with any, or all of you, let me &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;k you, and let con&s;cience give the an&s;wer&mdash;Is it not the doctrines I teach, and the &s;elf-denying duties of the go&s;pel, and the re&s;traints the&s;e lay on &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, that have rendered me unpopular to you? Is it not a de|&s;ire for &s;mooth things, and an ea&s;ier way to &s;al|vation, that have determined your choice in this matter; and would not the&s;e objections lead your minds in choo&s;ing another pa&s;tor? If this be true, let me &s;incerely pity you, and pray God in infinite mercy to your &s;ouls, to di&s;appoint your wi&s;hes: for let me a&s;&s;ure you in this my la&s;t ad|dre&s;s to you, that if ever you find mercy before God, it will be by believing and obeying that go&s;pel I have preached unto you. I can freely forgive all di&s;re&s;pect to my&s;elf; but in duty to God, and to your be&s;t good, I mu&s;t tell you God
<PB N="21" REF="035495_0020_1004E07C063A0650">
will not forgive your &s;ins and impenitence toward him, except you repent and believe the go&s;pel. My young friends, my heart's de&s;ire and prayer to God for you hath been, &s;till is, and I tru&s;t will be, that you may be &s;aved. The little pro&s;pects of &s;ucce&s;s among a people when divi&s;ions exi&s;t, and e&s;pecially when the mini&s;ter is the object of contention, has at times probably retarded my exertions for the promotion of religion among you, to a fault. It is my &s;incere wi&s;h that you may be earne&s;tly de&s;irous of knowledge both hu|man and divine, and that you may obtain this object, that you may al&s;o be &s;anctified by the Holy Gho&s;t; that you may indeed love God, and his glory, and the good of mankind; that when you come upon the &s;tage of action, and your fathers &s;hall be no more, your natural and moral virtues may be &s;uch, and &s;uch your bene|volence, that you may begin that golden age pre|dicted in holy writ concerning our di&s;ordered and confu&s;ed world; that your lives may be ho|ly and happy, your death's comfortable, your re|&s;urrection and judgment joyful, and your im|mortality glorious. Tho I now quit my mini&s;|terial concerns with you for this world, yet let us remember this is not our la&s;t meeting, nor the la&s;t concerning the things which have happened &s;ince my &s;ettlement among this people: nor will you be idle &s;pectators at this &s;cene. You mu&s;t account to God how you have heard and im|proved your warnings; and the rea&s;ons mu&s;t then be known why you have not repented, and believed the go&s;pel. My young friends, it is a good day for you to prepare for eternity; it is a
<PB N="22" REF="035495_0021_1004E07EC26F17B8">
day of great mercy with God, for enquiring &s;in|ners. Then be per&s;uaded to know the things which belong to your peace. It is a day of en|quiring, of trembling, and &s;eeking for mercy, and of obtaining in many places, with children and youth. Were &s;uch here pre&s;ent, and had opportunity, they would tenderly invite you to come and &s;ee their glorious Lord, who&s;e con&s;o|lations tran&s;cend every joy they ever had before, or that this world can afford. Finally, my youth|ful friends, let me earne&s;tly be&s;eech you to pre|pare for our la&s;t and &s;olemn meeting at the glori|ous and awful tribunal of our final Judge. Fare|well.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget the children of this &s;ociety on this &s;olemn occa&s;ion. As a te&s;timony of my &s;incere good will and concern for your be&s;t good, and as it is perhaps the la&s;t opportunity of pro|moting your future happine&s;s, let me tell you, though you are now young, yet you mu&s;t &s;oon die, and come to judgment. It becometh you to love and be kind one to the other; to love and obey your parents, and above all to love your God and Savior; early learn to know and to do his will. Though I may never &s;peak to you on the&s;e &s;ubjects again in this world, yet re|member you will &s;ee me at the judgment day, when before God, angels, and all men, you mu&s;t be reminded of what I have now, and what I have heretofore &s;aid in your hearing, on your duty to God, your parents, and to all people. And now bear it hereafter always on your mind, that you mu&s;t be condemned before the bar of
<PB N="23" REF="035495_0022_1004E0809433A568">
God at the great day, if you neglect the&s;e duties and obey not the go&s;pel of the Son of God. My little children, Farewell.</P>

<P>Finally, my friends and brethren, the people with whom I have labored in the go&s;pel the&s;e fourteen years, we are now to part. The world is wide in which we live; we cannot &s;ay where Providence may place us in future; God only knows the &s;cenes and changes we have yet to pa&s;s. Let us bear on our minds the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion with its future concern and importance to us; and let us be ready for death at the &s;um|mons; be prepared for the &s;ounding trumpet that &s;hall awake us at the final Judgment. May God Almighty ble&s;s us in future with his &s;pirit and pre&s;ence, wherever we may be placed on this enten&s;ive globe. May he &s;end you the ble&s;&s;ing of a pa&s;tor after his own heart, who &s;hall be faithful to God, and your &s;ouls; and may you, my hearers, be ready to receive and im|prove him to the everla&s;ting good of your &s;ouls; and may you be perfect, of good comfort, of one mind, and live in peace; and may the God of love and peace be with you always&mdash;Farewell.

<P>The Council was opened with Prayer by the moderator.</P>
<P>VOTES both of the Church and Society, re&s;pecting the Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the Rev. Mr. Fowler from his Pa&s;toral relation to them; were pre&s;ented and read. Mr. Fowler, and a Commit|tee from the Church and Society, &s;ignified their de&s;ire, that con&s;idering the pre&s;ent di&s;&s;ati&s;faction among this People, &s;aid relation &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved. It appeared to be the wi&s;h of both Church and Society, that if the Relation between them and Mr. Fowler be di&s;&s;olved; he &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in character, as again&s;t him, they have nothing to alledge either Heretical or Scandalous.</P>
<P>The Council having taken the matter into &s;erious and deli|berate con&s;ideration&mdash;</P>
<P>Voted unanimou&s;ly&mdash;</P>
<P><PB REF="035495_0024_1004E087461AF918">
That under the pre&s;ent di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances of this Church and Society, it appears expedient, that the partial rela|tion between Mr. Fowler and the Church and Society in this place be di&s;&s;olved. They do therefore advi&s;e that &s;aid Relation be di&s;&s;olved; and it is accordingly Di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>While we e&s;teem it nece&s;&s;ary to form this re&s;ult; we feel deeply affected that a Mini&s;ter whom we believe to have been a faithful, prudent Preacher of the Go&s;pel, &s;hould be reduced to &s;uch unhappy circum&s;tances as render it needful for him to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his labors in this part of Chri&s;t's vinyard. At the &s;ame time, we rejoice that the Votes of both Church and Society fully clear the Character of Mr. Fowler from any im|peachment of mi&s;conduct; and de&s;ire him to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed as a regular Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t. This de&s;ire being perfectly accor|dant with our own opinions and feelings; we do cheerfully and cordially Recommend Him to the Churches wherever God in his Providence &s;hall call him; as a &s;ound; faithful and pious Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>We lament the unhappy circum&s;tances of this Church and So|ciety which have led them to <HI>de&s;ire;</HI> and Mr. Fowler to con|&s;ent to his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.
