<P>Fear God. Honour the King.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SUCH is the conci&s;e, nervous and com|manding Style in which the Apo&s;tle in|forces tho&s;e two important Duties. He connects the re&s;pectful Honour and Obe|dience we owe to our Sovereign, with that filial, reverential Fear which is due to our Creator; not only becau&s;e they are characteri&s;tic of a real Chri&s;tian, and &s;hould be in&s;eparable; but becau&s;e our Welfare, Peace and Happine&s;s, temporal and eternal, depend on the Di&s;charge of them.</P>
<P>IT is worthy of Ob&s;ervation, that the&s;e Duties are often joined together in other Pa&s;&s;ages of &s;acred Writ, in the Old as well as New-Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>THUS Solomon exhorts,&mdash; <Q>My Son, fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change.</Q> And he immediately &s;ubjoins a weighty Rea&s;on for the Exhortation. <Q>For, &s;ays he, their Calamity &s;hall ri&s;e &s;uddenly; and who knoweth the Ruin of them both <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiv. 21, 22.</NOTE>?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="016810_0004_0F9E7EDA035EE270">WHEN an Opportunity of &s;peaking on tho&s;e two Points was occa&s;ionally pre&s;ented to our ble&s;|&s;ed Saviour, he al&s;o joined them together&mdash; <Q>Render unto Cae&s;ar, &s;ays he, the Things which are Cae&s;ar's; and unto God, the Things that are God's <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxii. 21. Mark xii. 17. Luke xx. 25.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THIS &s;erves to point out the clo&s;e Connection between tho&s;e Duties; it al&s;o places our Obliga|tion to, "Honour the King," in a &s;triking Light, however it may be di&s;regarded by &s;ome People. Duties which God hath thus united and joined together, no Man &s;hould ever pre&s;ume to put a&s;under.</P>
<P>THE tragical Event which we are enjoined by our Church to commemorate this Day, naturally &s;ugge&s;ts the Con&s;ideration of this Subject&mdash; particularly the latter Part of it, honouring the King. A Failure in this Duty did once involve our Nation in all the Horrors of Rebellion and Civil War. To &s;uch Lengths did the Phrenzy of Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and Republican Ambition pu&s;h on the Sons of Rebellion at that Period, that they imbrued their Hands in the Blood of their mo&s;t excellent Sovereign; thereby intailing Guilt on our Nation, and &s;taining our Hi&s;tory with indelible Infamy.</P>
<P>TO rai&s;e a ju&s;t Abhorrence for &s;uch atrocious Crimes&mdash;to pre&s;erve in our Minds a proper Sen&s;e of the Honour due to our Sovereign, by which the Ble&s;&s;ings of Harmony and Peace are &s;ecured&mdash; to deprecate the Divine Di&s;plea&s;ure for the Guilt then contracted, and that God would be plea&s;ed
<PB N="7" REF="016810_0005_0F9ECCA6D6D8D4C8">
to avert &s;imilar Guilt and Calamities for the future: For the&s;e great Purpo&s;es, our Church hath wi&s;ely and piou&s;ly &s;et apart this Day, as a Day of public Humiliation and Prayer; and hath appointed the excellent Office, which you have now heard, to be annually u&s;ed on the Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>EXPERIENCE &s;hews that too much Caution can|not be u&s;ed in guarding again&s;t &s;uch Evils. The Wi&s;dom of Man perhaps could not devi&s;e any Thing more effectual to prevent them, than the In&s;titution I have mentioned. If notwith&s;tanding, a Rebellion of the &s;ame Kind now afflicts this Country, we &s;hould not infer that this In&s;titution is u&s;ele&s;s, or &s;hould be laid a&s;ide; but ju&s;t the Rever&s;e. We &s;hould be the more punctual in ob&s;erving it; as this hath a Tendency to counteract the Spirit which produces &s;uch Di&s;a&s;ters; and, certain it is, that the De&s;pi&s;ers, not the con&s;cien|cious Ob&s;ervers of this In&s;titution, were the Authors of our pre&s;ent Calamities.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the Care that is taken to inculcate Principles of Virtue and Religion among Mankind, yet much Vice and Impiety prevail in the World. Would not the&s;e be &s;till more preva|lent, were that Care to be relaxed, or thrown a&s;ide?</P>
<P>TO fear God, is one of the fir&s;t and greate&s;t Duties of his rational Creatures. This Fear ari&s;es from a ju&s;t Conception of His Being, Atributes, Perfections and Pre&s;ence. It is mingled with Love, and re&s;embles the Fear of a dutiful, affectionate Child towards a tender Father. It is the Begining

of Wi&s;dom <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. ix. 10.</NOTE>; and when habitually fixed in the Soul, is the Foundation of true Religion&mdash;the Parent of every Virtue.</P>
<P>TO honour the King, is another Duty of great Con&s;equence, connected with, and flowing from, the former. Permit me, as this Day requires, to enlarge upon the latter &mdash;to explain briefly what is implied in the Precept&mdash;"Honour the King;" and then to &s;hew the Rea&s;ons on which the Di&s;|charge of this Duty is founded. There are few who will not acknowledge that the Con&s;ideration of this Subject is proper in the&s;e unhappy Times.</P>
<P N="1">I. ST. PETER wrote this Epi&s;tle from Rome <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>That St. Peter was at Rome, and &s;uffered Martyrdom in that City, are Facts which are &s;upported by the unanimous, uncontra|dicted Te&s;timony of Chri&s;tian Writers of the <HI>five</HI> fir&s;t Centuries. This hath been clearly &s;hewn by Bi&s;hop PEARSON, and Dr. CAVE, in An&s;wer to &s;ome who, from a fal&s;e Zeal again&s;t Popery, &s;eemed to que&s;tion whether that Apo&s;tle ever was at Rome: As if the Antichri&s;tian Errors and U&s;urpations of Popery could not be &s;uffi|ciently refuted, from Scripture and the primitive Writers, without denying &s;o well atte&s;ted a Fact, on Principles that would &s;ubvert all ancient Hi&s;tory.</P><P>That St. Peter wrote this Epi&s;tle from Rome, which he figura|tively calls <HI>Babylon,</HI> Chap. v. 13. hath al&s;o the general Suffrage of Antiquity. This Opinion is accordingly adopted by the be&s;t modern Commentators, not only among Prote&s;tants, as GROTIUS, HAM|MOND, WHITBY, &amp;c. but even by Writers of the Church of Rome in general. Rome was figuratively called Babylon on Ac|count of the Re&s;emblance between tho&s;e Cities in their Greatne&s;s, their Idolatries, their Oppo&s;ition to the true Church of God, and in their final Doom. This whole Subject hath been examined with great Accuracy by Dr. LARDNER very lately, whom I therefore mention: He thinks that St. Peter wrote this Epi&s;tle from Rome, about the Year 64. CREDIB. GOSP. HIST. Vol. xv. Chap. 18, 19.</P></NOTE>. He addre&s;&s;ed it to all tho&s;e who were converted to Chri&s;tianity, and di&s;per&s;ed through the &s;everal A&s;iatic Provinces mentioned in the Beginning of the Epi&s;tle.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="016810_0007_0F9E7EDBDBFB1DD0">THE fatal Period was now approaching, when the Jewi&s;h Nation, abandoned by Heaven, were to feel the heavy Judgments that had been de|nounced again&s;t them by the Son of God, whom they crucified. They were ca&s;t off, and no longer the peculiar People of God. Their general Con|duct rai&s;ed the Aver&s;ion of Mankind again&s;t them. They were per&s;ecuting and uncharitable towards others; whil&s;t rent by the bittere&s;t Animo&s;ities among them&s;elves. They were &s;editious al&s;o, frequently rai&s;ing In&s;urrections, di&s;&s;olving the Obligations between the Prince and the Subject, and making Religion the Cloak of Di&s;loyalty.</P>
<P>HITHERTO, Chri&s;tians were con&s;idered by the Gentiles as only a Sect of the Jews; and the Crimes of the latter were, through Ignorance or Malice, imputed to the former. Hence there was a Nece&s;&s;ity, that the Apo&s;tle &s;hould exhort Chri&s;tians to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by tho&s;e Virtues which were oppo&s;ite to the Vices &s;o frequently practi&s;ed by the Jews&mdash;to convince the World that they were different People, guided by different Princi|ples; that &s;o their Lives might bear the &s;tricte&s;t Scrutiny, and turn the Detraction of their Enemies into Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS will &s;erve to explain the Ver&s;es immedi|ately preceding my Text, which are highly de|&s;erving of our Attention. <Q>Dearly beloved, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, I be&s;eech you as Strangers and Pilgrims, ab&s;tain from fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts, which war again&s;t the Soul, having your Conver&s;a|tion hone&s;t among the Gentiles: That whereas they &s;peak again&s;t you as evil Doers, they may by your good Works which they &s;hall

behold, glorify God in the Day of Vi&s;itation.

Nor can I account for it otherwi&s;e than by &s;aying that the Tran&s;lators, influenced by the Authority of BEZA, who thus renders it, have in this, as in &s;ome other In&s;tances, adopted his Peculiarities. The Apo&s;tle in the&s;e Words evidently lays down a general Propo&s;ition, recommending a meek, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Behaviour towards all Men, as characteri&s;tic of the Chri&s;tian Religion. He then proceeds to Particulars, &s;pecifying tho&s;e to whom this Behoviour &s;hould in a peculiar Manner be &s;hewn, fir&s;t to the King or Emperor, next, to his Governors, &amp;c.</NOTE>, for the Lord's Sake, whether it be to the King as Supreme, or unto Governors, as unto them that are &s;ent by him for the Puni&s;hment of evil Doers, and for the Prai&s;e of them that do well.

As free, and not u&s;ing your Liberty for a Cloak of Maliciou&s;ne&s;s, but as the Servants of God. Honour all Men; love the Brother|hood: Fear God. Honour the King.</Q></P>
<P>HERE, Purity of Life, Charity, mutual Love and Submi&s;&s;ion to Government, <Q>for the Lord's Sake,</Q> being the expre&s;s "Will of God," are earne&s;tly urged by the Apo&s;tle; ju&s;t as they are el&s;ewhere urged by ST. PAUL <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 1&mdash;7.</NOTE>, for &s;imilar Rea&s;ons. By the&s;e, Chri&s;tians were to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from others, and manife&s;t the native Excellence and Spirit of their Religion.

<PB N="11" REF="016810_0009_0F9E7EDD1F505798">
may affirm, that they al&s;o greatly depend on it even now.</P>
<P>NERO was Emperor of Rome when St. Peter wrote this Catholic Epi&s;tle; and notwith&s;tanding the vicious Character of that Prince, he delivers the Precept in my Text&mdash; "honour the King." This was to be a general Rule for all Chri&s;tians. The per&s;onal Character of the Magi&s;trate was not to interfere with the Civil Duty of the Subject: Even when bad, it did not di&s;&s;olve the Obligati|on of the latter &mdash;were the contrary principle admitted, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily and daily fill the World with Confu&s;ion and Di&s;order. The Chri&s;tian therefore, is here injoined to honour the Per&s;on who is ve&s;ted with legal Authority, and whom the Providence of God hath placed over him.</P>
<P>TO comprehend the Wi&s;dom of this Injunction the better, and explain the Duty before us, it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that Government is the only Means by which human Happine&s;s can be attained.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the Di&s;po&s;ition of Providence, and the Condition of our Nature, we are born in a State of Society. Without Society, Mankind could not exi&s;t&mdash;the whole Race mu&s;t inevitably be extingui&s;hed. But Society cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without Government. It is the Band which unites the Intere&s;ts of Individuals; it &s;ecures to them their re&s;pective Rights, and pre&s;erves them from Injuries; it is the Source of numberle&s;s Ble&s;&s;ings, which are interrupted, or wholly vani&s;h, the Moment it is di&s;turbed. In a Word, whatever
<PB N="12" REF="016810_0010_0F9E7EDDE0BE08C8">
Portion of Happine&s;s is allotted by Providence to the Children of Men, is attainable only through the Means of Government. And as our benevo|lent Creator undoubtedly willed the Happine&s;s of his Creatures, he mu&s;t have willed the Means al&s;o without which that Happine&s;s could not be ob|tained. Hence, Government in general &s;hould be re&s;olved into the Divine Will. It is "the Ordinance of God, ordained by him" to mini&s;ter to our Good.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 1, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE></P>
<P>GOVERNMENT implies Subordination. Where Government is, there mu&s;t be &s;ome who pre&s;ide or govern&mdash;and others, over whom that pre&s;idency is exerci&s;ed: From the very Nature and De&s;ign of Government, it is the Duty of the latter to honour and obey the former. This is al&s;o the "Will of God"; and hence, the Precept in my Text,&mdash; "honour the King."</P>
<P>TO honour the King, is to entertain re&s;pectful Sentiments of his Authority and Per&s;on&mdash;to &s;peak always with Deference of both&mdash;to promote the Peace and Stability of his Reign, and pay a chear|ful Obedience to his Laws&mdash;to check, as far as we are able, the Calumnies which Sedition or Malice would propagate to his Di&s;advantage, to oppo&s;e the Proceedings which would di&s;turb or endanger his Authority&mdash;and to promote the&s;e Sentiments and this Conduct among others.</P>
<P>THIS Duty implies that we &s;hould affectionate|ly intere&s;t our&s;elves in whatever concerns the Honour, the Fame and Security of our Sovereign
<PB N="13" REF="016810_0011_0F9E7EDEAB45D5C8">
and his Government. The&s;e we &s;hould a&s;&s;ert, and generou&s;ly defend again&s;t all Attempts to injure them; whether tho&s;e of avowed Enemies&mdash;or of &s;uch as with equally malignant De&s;igns, though under plau&s;ible Pretences, would de&s;troy and &s;ub|vert them.</P>
<P>OUR fervent Prayers &s;hould a&s;cend to the Al|mighty for the Pre&s;ervation and Pro&s;perity of our Sovereign. This is expre&s;sly enjoined by the Word of God <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Timoth. ii, 1, 2, 3.</NOTE>; and is a Part of the Duty we are con&s;i|dering. We &s;hould devoutly pray, that He, <Q>by whom Kings reign, and Princes decree Ju&s;tice,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. viii. 15.</NOTE></Q> would ble&s;s the King, direct his Coun&s;els, grant him a long and happy Reign, crown his Under|takings with Succe&s;s, and make him in&s;trumental in promoting the Glory of God, the Intere&s;ts of true Religion and Virtue, and the Welfare, Safe|ty and Happine&s;s of his People; and finally, that He would confer on him Immortality and Glory in the Life to come.</P>
<P>IF we honour the King, according to the Spirit of my Text, we &s;hall be &s;incerely di&s;po&s;ed, and &s;hall actually exert our&s;elves, to do each of the&s;e.</P>
<P>IT may be proper to ob&s;erve further, that this Duty is not confined to tho&s;e who live under any one particular Form of Government: It extends to the Subjects of all regular States, lawfully e&s;tabli&s;hed. That &s;ome Forms of Government are preferable to others, cannot be doubted; yet neither our Saviour, nor his Apo&s;tles have decided where that Preference is due. This was foreign to their De&s;ign. They interfered not with the Civil
<PB N="14" REF="016810_0012_0F9E7EDF60E8CA18">
Rights of Individuals, nor with the Political Con|&s;titution of States; but laid down the general Duty of Subjects, who are to <Q>render to Cae&s;ar the Things that are Cae&s;ar's,</Q>&mdash;<Q>be &s;ubject to the higher Powers,</Q> and honour tho&s;e who are ve&s;ted with &s;upreme Authority; whether that Authority be lodged in One, in a Few, or in Many.</P>
<P>SUCH is the Nature of the important Duty be|fore us. It would be ea&s;y to enlarge on each of tho&s;e Particulars. But I &s;hall only add, that the Duty here enjoined by the Expre&s;&s;ion, <Q>honour the King,</Q> is in our Language and Law, &s;ignified by the Word <HI>Allegiance.</HI> All the King's Subjects are bound to Allegiance, before, or even without, any Oath for that Purpo&s;e. Oaths, Fealty and Homage were only in&s;tituted to remind the Sub|ject of his previous Duty, in certain Ca&s;es, and in&s;ure the better Performance of it. They are no more than Declarations of what was implied be|fore, and of that to which the Subject was indi&s;|pen&s;ibly bound, from the very Nature of Govern|ment, and the Rea&s;on of Things.</P>
<P>INDEED, if the Oath of Allegiance be broken by violating the Duty to which it obligeth, it aggra|vates a Man's Guilt, by adding Perjury to Trea|&s;on. <Q>But it does not increa&s;e the Civil Obliga|tion to Loyalty; it only &s;trengthens the &s;ocial Tie by uniting it with that of Religion.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I Black&s;tone, B. I. Chap. 10.</NOTE></Q> This may &s;erve to expo&s;e the Delu&s;ion of &s;ome, who imagine they are under little or no Obliga|tion to Loyalty, or "to honour the King," becau&s;e they have not taken the Oath of Allegiance.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="016810_0013_0F9E7EE01E4826C8">II. I now proceed to &s;hew the Rea&s;ons on which the Di&s;charge of this Duty is founded.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE have the expre&s;s Commands of God, of his in&s;pired Prophets and Apo&s;tles for di&s;charg|ing this Duty. We &s;hould certainly be punctual in the Ob&s;ervation of a Duty which is &s;o often and &s;o earne&s;tly enjoined by the Authority of Heaven. When it is "the Will of God," and required of us for "the Lord's Sake," we &s;hould con&s;cien|ciou&s;ly practi&s;e it.</P>
<P>CAN any Authority be greater than that of the Almighty? Or &s;hould any of his Precepts be lightly regarded? Do they not all claim our ready and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Obedience? And can any Com|mand be more peremptory or po&s;itive than that for honouring the King? How then can any who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians di&s;regard this Command|ment; or think that Con&s;cience is not concerned in obeying it?</P>
<P>ONE of the &s;ore Evils which for &s;ome Time hath infe&s;ted our Nation, and doth infe&s;t it now perhaps more than ever, is, to re&s;olve this, and every other Duty, however &s;acred, into what is called political Obligation; which Obligation is generally mea&s;ured by People's <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and will readily give Way to the Caprice, Di&s;content, Ambition, Intere&s;t, Pride, and other irregular Pa&s;&s;ions of Individuals.</P>
<P>IF tho&s;e Men who fal&s;ly a&s;&s;ert, that all Religi|on is a State Engine&mdash;the Invention of Politicians to keep the Multitude in Subjection and Order&mdash; if the&s;e &s;hould al&s;o a&s;&s;ert, that the Duty of Loy|alty,
<PB N="16" REF="016810_0014_0F9E7EE123A8A1B0">
honouring the King, hangs on the &s;lender Thread of Political Obligation only, and that it is a Matter with which God and Con&s;cience have nothing to do; it need not occa&s;ion any Surprize.</P>
<P>BUT that profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, who really be|lieve in a divine Revelation, and acknowledge its Authority&mdash;that the&s;e &s;hould be the Dupes of &s;uch Men&mdash;that they &s;hould make no Con&s;cience of di&s;honouring their King, and rebelling again&s;t him&mdash;that they &s;hould knowingly trample on the Law of God, and act as if no &s;uch Law exi&s;ted&mdash; that in&s;tead of obeying this Law, they &s;hould be Trumpeters of Sedition and Rebellion: This is a&s;toni&s;hing indeed! Did not melancholly Experi|ence convince us of its Truth, we &s;hould think it impo&s;&s;ible that any who profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity, could pur&s;ue a Conduct &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite to the Spirit of their Religion!</P>
<P>HOW different was the Conduct of primitive Chri&s;tians, who exemplified in their Lives the Precepts of their Ma&s;ter; who &s;tudied to obey his Will; and who&s;e Innocence, Patience and Forti|tude finally triumphed over all the Oppo&s;ition of Heathen Error and Idolatry! In nothing were they more di&s;tingui&s;hed than in Submi&s;&s;ion to their Civil Rulers, and punctual Ob&s;ervation of their Laws, where tho&s;e Laws did not contradict the expre&s;s Will of God; as in the Ca&s;e of &s;acrificing to Idols, renouncing their Saviour, &s;wearing by Daemons, by the Genius of Cae&s;ar, and the like.</P>
<P>OUR ble&s;&s;ed Lord commanded his Followers to love their Enemies, and pray for their Per&s;ecu|tors&mdash;to render to Cae&s;ar the Things that are Cae|&s;ar's.

To clear him&s;elf from all Imputation of Sedition, he told Pilate that his <Q>Kingdom was not of this World.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John xviii. 36.</NOTE></Q> His Kingdom did not in|terfere with earthly Kingdoms&mdash;its Spirit and De|&s;ign were totally different, and it was to be pro|moted and admini&s;tered by other Laws and Mea|&s;ures.

They per&s;evered in the above Principles and Practice for Ages af|ter Tertullian's Time, untill a Degeneracy of Manners and Decay of Piety in many, gave Ri&s;e to new Maxims and a different Conduct.

BUT if Men will not regard this Precept from a Principle of Con&s;cience, and becau&s;e it is the Will of God; yet at lea&s;t for their own Sake they &s;hould do &s;o: For on a due Ob&s;ervation of it, the Stability of Government and the Peace of Societies depend; and in the&s;e, it may be affirmed, the Happine&s;s of Individuals is involved. This un|que&s;tionably is the Ca&s;e in our Government, where all are under the Protection of equal Laws; and no Subject can labour under any Grievance for which the Law and Con&s;titution have not pro|vided a Remedy.</P>
<P>TO honour the King therefore, is not only the Duty which God requires and Rea&s;on approves; but it is a Duty, by the Di&s;charge of which we contribute to the Happine&s;s of all our Fellow Sub|jects: For hereby we &s;upport the Con&s;titution and Government which &s;ecure to them that Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE Welfare of Society &s;hould be a leading Principle of our Conduct. Rea&s;on and Human|ity oblige us to wi&s;h that Peace &s;hould be e&s;tab|li&s;hed, and its Ble&s;&s;ings be widely diffu&s;ed&mdash;that Religion, Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hould flou|ri&s;h&mdash;that public Pro&s;perity and private Content|ment &s;hould prevail&mdash;that tho&s;e Benefits which help to &s;weeten Life, and alievate the Sufferings of this Scene of Tryal, &s;hould abound. Who will deny this? Is it not &s;elf evident? Can tho&s;e Ble&s;|&s;ings and Benefits be otherwi&s;e enjoyed than under a regular Government? And does not the Ob|&s;ervation of this Precept tend as much to confirm,
<PB N="21" REF="016810_0019_0F9E7EE9208AB040">
as the Neglect of it to &s;ubvert, regular Govern|ment?</P>
<P>WHAT other Security have we for tho&s;e Bene|fits; or again&s;t Oppre&s;&s;ion, Inju&s;tice, Violence and Wickedne&s;s, than that of Government? It is evidently the Ordinance of God&mdash;the Remedy which his Providence hath appointed again&s;t the numberle&s;s Evils of Anarchy. Remove that Barrier, and every Species of Iniquity would rage and reign without Controul. The Weak would fall a Prey to the Strong&mdash;the Innocent to the Guil|ty&mdash;the Meek and Humble to the De&s;igning and Ambitious.</P>
<P>BUT Government cannot be carried on &s;o as to avert the&s;e Evils, unle&s;s tho&s;e who rule, are hon|oured and obeyed. The Obedience of Subjects, flowing from a Principle of Con&s;cience, and Honour to the Sovereign, is the active Spring by which Government is moved and exerted. Take away that Spring, and the whole Machine is di&s;|ordered: it mu&s;t &s;tand &s;till; and all the Evils of Anarchy and Mi&s;rule would en&s;ue.</P>
<P>FOR although the Offence, not honouring the King, may &s;eem to be per&s;onal, and directed again&s;t the Prince only; yet it re&s;ts not there. It virtually extends to the whole Community, and affects every Member of it; not only by in&s;ulting each of them in the Per&s;on of their Sovereign; but by weakening the Energy of Government, which prepares the Way for all tho&s;e Di&s;orders to ru&s;h in.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="22" REF="016810_0020_0F9E7EE9DAC1F5D8">3. AND this &s;ugge&s;ts another Motive or Rea|&s;on for di&s;charging this Duty; namely, That the greate&s;t Evils which can befall Society, nece&s;&s;a|rily attend the Neglect or Breach of it. So that if even the Authority of God were &s;et a&s;ide in this Ca&s;e; the Principles of Humanity, Rea&s;on and found Policy would decide in Favour of the Pre|cept&mdash;"honour the King."</P>
<P>MORE human Blood hath been &s;hed&mdash;greater Mi&s;eries and Calamities have been entailed on Mankind&mdash;and more audacious Impieties and Enormities of every Kind have been committed by Means of Sedition and Rebellion, than perhaps through any other Cau&s;e whatever.</P>
<P>IF Men once deviate from the obvious Path of their Duty, there is no telling where they will &s;top. Perhaps they apprehend no great Danger at fir&s;t, and fore&s;ee not all the Con&s;equences of their Procedure. Having &s;ubdued the fir&s;t Struggles of Con&s;cience, it afterwards becomes more pli|ant; and they are gradually carried on from one Step to another, till they find them&s;elves in a Situation, that is extremely difficult and pe|rilous. Thus have the mo&s;t aggravated Evils ari&s;en from &s;eemingly &s;mall Beginnings, which occa&s;ioned little Alarm: And this is often the Ca&s;e of Rebellion&mdash;it proceeds mo&s;tly from a neglect of the Precept before us, "Honour the King." Many con&s;ider this Neglect as a very trifling of|fence; but how pernicious has it frequently prov|ed in its Effects to Mankind!</P>
<P>WHEN di&s;re&s;pectful Sentiments of the Sove|reign are entertained, contrary to this Command, it
<PB N="23" REF="016810_0021_0F9E7EEAC0784CE0">
leads to di&s;re&s;pectful and &s;editious Language; and the Tran&s;ition is ea&s;y and natural from the Lan|guage to the Practice of Sedition. He that freely indulges him&s;elf in that Language, wants only an Opportunity to realize, and reduce it to Practice.</P>
<P>Now reflect for a Moment on the horrid Train of Evils which follow Rebellion. The fir&s;t Sta|ges of its Progre&s;s are carried on by Deceit, Vio|lence and Perjury. It is dreadful even in its mild|e&s;t Effects. It is &s;tained with Blood, and diffu&s;es general Di&s;tre&s;s and Mi&s;ery. The Ruin of Mil|lions attend it. All the dark, malevolent Pa&s;&s;ions of the Soul are rou&s;ed and exerted; its mild and amiable affections are &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and with them, virtuous Principles are laid pro&s;trate. Hence it is that Civil Wars are always more cruel and bar|barous than foreign Wars, and more de&s;tructive to Morals; In the former, per&s;onal Revenge and Animo&s;ity mingle, and kindle up the Soul to tenfold Rage. Reckon over the Benefits which Government confers on Mankind; and the Evil which is contrary to each of the&s;e Benefits, is brought on Mankind by Rebellion. Add to all this, that when &s;ucce&s;sful, it generally ends in Tyranny, and the mo&s;t grievous Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>EACH of the&s;e Particulars was literally verified in the Rebellion, who&s;e Guilt was con&s;umated by the &s;hedding of Royal Blood&mdash;by the Martyrdom of King CHARLES I, which we commemorate this Day.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not take up your Time with a minute Detail of the Ri&s;e, Progre&s;s and Effects of that Rebellion. Suffice it to ob&s;erve, that it began

with the Breach of St. Peter's Precept&mdash;"honour the King." Groundle&s;s Su&s;picions of him were cheri&s;hed, and the mo&s;t palpable Fal&s;hoods were propagated by de&s;igning Men. Hereby the Minds of many were poi&s;oned. Ambition under the u&s;ual Ma&s;k of Patrioti&s;m, and Enthu&s;ia&s;m in the Garb of Religion, blew the Trumpet of Sedi|tion. Open Violence &s;ucceeded, and a bloody, ruinous Rebellion was the Con&s;equence. The Nation was weakened, its Property de&s;troyed and di&s;&s;ipated, and the Con&s;titution was wholly &s;ub|verted. The Sovereign was deliberately murder|ed&mdash;a Sovereign who was not more di&s;tingui&s;hed by his Sufferings, than by his Fortitude and Pro|bity&mdash;by unaffected Piety to God, and Benevo|lence to Mankind. Of this he gave the highe&s;t Te&s;timony that Man is capable of giving&mdash;he re&s;i&s;ted unto Blood, and laid down his Life, rather than betray the Church of God, or the People, committed to his Care by divine Providence.</P>

<P>THE Tran&s;actions which led to the pre&s;ent Re|bellion are recent, and fre&s;h in your Memory.

Imaginary Dangers were pretended; the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Populace were inflamed to a Degree of Phrenzy; and every Engine was employed to carry on the Work of Sedition. The&s;e Methods, managed with great Artifice and Zeal, and each Circum&s;tance heightened with the bittere&s;t Ag|gravations, proved but too &s;ucce&s;sful. The Minds of many were poi&s;oned, and &s;educed from their Duty; and &s;everal well meaning Per&s;ons were prevailed on to join in the de&s;tructive Mea|&s;ures that were afterwards adopted. Indepen|dency, that Foible of weak Minds tinctured with local Pride, in which however the ambitious Leaders &s;ought their own Aggrandi&s;ement, though big with certain Ruin to this Country, was declared; and then Rebellion, undi&s;gui&s;ed and undi&s;&s;embled, flouri&s;hed over us.</P>

<P>THIS Procedure was not confined to that Peo|ple, whom he cho&s;e, and were under a particular Di&s;pen&s;ation. There is the cleare&s;t Proof of the contrary. The general Rules and Laws of God's Proceedings with the Children of Men, are the &s;ame and invariable&mdash;invariable as his Nature, and the Relation which Men bear to him; for all are equally his Creatures&mdash;all are equally capable of Virtue and Vice.</P>
<P>THE Jews indeed had a peculiar Law and Di&s;pen&s;ation; and by that Law and Di&s;pen&s;ation they were judged. The Gentiles were under the Law and Light of Nature, and had traditional In|&s;truction; by that Law, that Light and In&s;truc|tion they were al&s;o judged. The General Rules of the Divine Procedure, as I &s;aid before, were the &s;ame to both; the Mode of Application only varied according to their different Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THUS we find in Fact that many of the mo&s;t celebrated Heathen Nations, States and Cities which figured in ancient Hi&s;tory, are the Subjects of Prophecy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides tho&s;e called the four great Empires, viz. The Babyloni&s;h, Per&s;ian, Grecian and Roman; the Egyptians, Edomites, Moabites, &amp;c. Tyre, Sidon, &amp;c. are the Subjects of divine Prophecy&mdash;their Vices are reproved, their Overthrow on Account of tho&s;e Vices, is predicted.</NOTE>. They were liable to the &s;ame pro|vidential
<PB N="32" REF="016810_0030_0F9E7EF7743F0BB8">
Di&s;pen&s;ations with the Jews. Judgments were denounced again&s;t their Vices; and tho&s;e Judgments were inflicted. Con&s;ult the Prophe|cies recorded in the Book of God concerning tho&s;e Nations; then turn to the Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Nations, and you will find the Prophecies concerning them exactly verified.</P>
<P>HENCE War, Famine, Pe&s;tilence and other Ca|lamities, are expre&s;sly called the Judgments of God, to execute his Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t guilty Nations. Obedient to the divine Command, the&s;e accordingly ru&s;h forth, and vi&s;it the Abodes of Sin. They come to cha&s;ten and reclaim, if Men will for&s;ake their Sins, and return to their Duty: Or el&s;e, to overturn and de&s;troy, if they are im|penitent, and refu&s;e to reform.</P>
<P>WHENEVER therefore we &s;ee tho&s;e Judgments abroad, and a People vi&s;ited with them, which is our Ca&s;e at pre&s;ent; we may be a&s;&s;ured that the Hand of God is <HI>there,</HI> and that he is calling tho&s;e People to an Account for their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. To "fear God" is the e&s;pecial Duty of &s;uch a People&mdash;the Sentiments and Conduct which they &s;hould adopt, are pointed out by Ho&s;ea&mdash;<Q>Come, and let us return unto the Lord; for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath &s;mitten, and will bind us up<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ho&s;ea, vi. 1.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>TOO many are diverted from their proper Duty on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, and fail in making a right U&s;e of tho&s;e Calamities, by attending only to the &s;econdary and vi&s;ible Cau&s;es of them. They for|get the fir&s;t Spring and Mover, and the Ends for
<PB N="33" REF="016810_0031_0F9E7EF8293967E0">
which Calamities are &s;ent. Unfruitful and un|whole&s;ome Sea&s;ons commonly produce Dearth and Mortality; Ambition, Avarice, Re&s;entment, and the Intrigues of de&s;igning Men are the im|mediate and general Cau&s;es of War. In the&s;e proximate Cau&s;es, People re&s;t, without looking further. They do not con&s;ider that Providence always works by &s;uch Means, and employs them to effect its Purpo&s;es; and that the Calamities thus produced, come not the le&s;s from God, be|cau&s;e they are brought about through tho&s;e &s;e|condary Means and Cau&s;es.</P>
<P>A FEW In&s;tances will elucidate this Point with Re&s;pect to the Calamities of War, which concern us mo&s;t at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE A&s;&s;yrian, that is Sennacherib, is expre&s;&s;|ly called "the Rod of God's Anger," and was <HI>&s;ent</HI> again&s;t the Jews to cha&s;ti&s;e them for their Vi|ces, which he accordingly did<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah x. 5.</NOTE>. Cyrus &s;urprized and took Babylon<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xlv.</NOTE>; Alexander of Macedon over|threw the Per&s;ian Monarchy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dan. ii. 39. viii. 5. xi. 3.</NOTE>, as was predicted of each; and the Romans reduced Jeru&s;alem, and inflicted tho&s;e heavy Judgments on the Jews which had been denounced again&s;t them by our Saviour.<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxiv. 15&mdash;22,</NOTE></P>
<P>THE Prophecies concerning tho&s;e memorable Events undeniably prove that they happened by the Appointment of God: Yet they were brought about by Men who knew not the divine Will, and were actuated &s;olely by temporal Motives. What was &s;aid of the A&s;&s;yrian, may be affirmed of each&mdash;<Q>Howbeit he meaneth not &s;o, neither

doth his Heart think &s;o; but it is in his Heart to de&s;troy, and cut off Nations not a few.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah x. 7.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>THESE were the Scourges of God; they were the In&s;truments that executed his Purpo&s;es; though all Claim to Merit on their Part was pre|cluded, becau&s;e they were uncon&s;cious of tho&s;e Purpo&s;es; it was not in their Heart to accom|pli&s;h them, nor did they mean &s;o. They were influenced by Ambition, Pride, Cruelty, and a Thir&s;t of Conque&s;t; and accordingly, were li|able, in their Turn, to the Stroke of divine Ju&s;tice for their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Excellent are the Reflections of the mo&s;t worthy and learned Bi&s;hop of London, Dr. LOWTH&mdash;the Ornament of Religion, Let|ters, and the pre&s;ent Age&mdash;on this Subject &mdash;<Q>God in the Cour&s;e of his Providence, makes U&s;e of great Conquerors and Tyrants, as his In&s;truments to execute his Judgments in the Earth; he employs one wicked Nation to &s;courge another. The Inflector of the Puni&s;hment may perhaps be as culpable as the Sufferer; and may add to his Guilt by indulging his Cruelty in executing God's Ju&s;tice. When he has fulfilled the Work to which the divine Vengeance has ordained him, he will become him&s;elf the Object of it. God charges the Babylonians, though employed by him&s;elf to cha&s;ti&s;e his People, with Cruelty in Regard to them. They exceeded the Bounds of Ju&s;tice and Humanity in oppre&s;&s;ing and de&s;troying them; and though they were really executing the righteous Decree of God, yet, as far as it regarded them&s;elves, they were only indulging their own Ambition and Violence.</Q> <HI>Note on</HI> I&s;aiah, xlvii. 6.</P><P>This Note is (among others, replete with Erudition, fine Sen&s;e, and judicious Critici&s;m) annexed to his Lord&s;hip's <HI>New Tran&s;la|tion of I&s;aiah into Engli&s;h,</HI> lately publi&s;hed-The be&s;t Tran&s;lation, beyond Doubt, that has ever been made of that &s;ublime, evangelical Prophet into any Language. The Lovers of &s;acred Literature mu&s;t be equally plea&s;ed and in&s;tructed by this Book. The Tran&s;lation contributes more to remove Difficulties, and elucidate the Prophet's Sen&s;e, than Volumes of Commentaries. We find the elegant Sim|plicity of the Original retained; whil&s;t the Energy, Grandeur and Sublimity by which this Prophet is &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed, are happily transfu&s;ed into the Tran&s;lation.</P><P>The whole Bible, equally well tran&s;lated and explained (and the right Method for both is here pointed out) would be the mo&s;t valu|able Acqui&s;ition perhaps to the Church of God, that it has received &s;ince the Days of In&s;piration. Whoever has read this Book and his Lord&s;hip's former Work, <HI>De Sacra Poe&s;i Hebraeorum,</HI> will not he&s;itate to pronounce him one of the able&s;t Critics&mdash;probably the very fir&s;t and able&s;t in &s;acred Literature&mdash;that our Nation or any other hath produced.

<PB N="35" REF="016810_0033_0F9E7EF9F47D87D0">
infinite Wi&s;dom and Power of God are con&s;picu|ous, in educing Good out of Evil; making the irregular Pa&s;&s;ions of Men &s;ub&s;ervient to his De|&s;igns, and to the Glory of his Moral Govern|ment. Thus not only Idolatrous Heathens, but even In&s;ects and Vermin, nay, the very Elements, have been delegated by the God of Heaven, to puni&s;h and reclaim his offending People&mdash;to carry his threatened Judgments among guilty Nations.</P>
<P>I mention the&s;e Things purely to &s;hew, that we &s;hould look beyond the immediate Authors of our pre&s;ent Calamities. We &s;hould rai&s;e our Thoughts to God, own his Hand, and acknow|ledge the Ju&s;tice of his Di&s;pen&s;ations. We &s;hould fear him, as the con&s;tant Witne&s;s, the righteous Judge of all our Actions&mdash;a God of Mercy to tho&s;e who fear and &s;erve him&mdash;a con|&s;uming Fire to ob&s;tinate Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>FEAR, when not directed to its proper Object, is indeed a mean Pa&s;&s;ion. The Almighty is its true Object; and to fear him, is as much our Honour and Wi&s;dom, as it is our Duty. The Fear of God will guard us again&s;t the Violation of his Law; it will lead us to Repentance, if we have offended him, and to the con&s;cien&s;cious Di&s;|charge of each Duty we owe to him and our Fel|low Creatures; it will in&s;pire us with Confidence and firm Tru&s;t in Him, and be a Shield again&s;t all other Fears and Terrors.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="016810_0034_0F9E7EFA71C30768">THE Almighty has the &s;upream uncontrolled Di&s;po&s;al of all Things. The Actions and Hearts of Men&mdash;the Powers of Nature and Events of this World, are entirely in his Hand. He can direct or change, he can repre&s;s or accelerate them as &s;eemeth be&s;t to his unerring Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>THE Per&s;on who firmly believes this; and in Con&s;equence of that Belief, habitually fears God in his Heart, &s;incerely &s;erving him, and placing his Confidence in him, will feel Con&s;olation, Hope and Fortitude &s;pringing up within him, at the Approach, or under the Pre&s;&s;ure of any Cala|mity. He will not yield to unmanly Fears; but confidently look up to God for Support and De|liverance.</P>
<P>THESE Reflections are very &s;uitable to our pre|&s;ent Situation&mdash;and may we profit by them. The Times admoni&s;h us to examine our Ways, hum|ble our&s;elves before God, and turn to him with unfeigned Repentance. Proceeding by the &s;ame Rules which he hath always ob&s;erved towards of|fending Nations, his Judgments are gone forth to vi&s;it us for our Abu&s;e of his Mercies, our Barrenne&s;s under his Go&s;pel, and the other numberle&s;s Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions by which we have pro|voked him.</P>
<P>CONSULT your Con&s;cience, and then tell me&mdash; Should we not hearken to the Voice of God, &s;peaking to us in his Judgments, and calling us to Reformation? Can we look for his Favour or Pardon, if we per&s;i&s;t in offending him? Or expect his Ble&s;&s;ing, if the Cry of our Sins continues to enter his Ears? Would it be right in us to repeat
<PB N="37" REF="016810_0035_0F9E7EFB359FE7C0">
or multiply our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, when all that is dear to us, or valuable on Earth, is at Stake in the pre&s;ent Conte&s;t; and when the I&s;&s;ue of this Conte&s;t is &s;u&s;pended on his Will?</P>
<P>IF any Per&s;ons among us, by their vicious Lives, di&s;honour God and provoke him; they are wor&s;e Enemies to us than either Rebels, or their Popi&s;h Allies. They make the God of Nature our Ad|ver&s;ary, who can &s;ummon the Powers of Nature, and arm every Element, to work our De&s;truction, and defeat our De&s;igns. The Efforts and Power of Man may be re&s;i&s;ted; but who can re&s;i&s;t him that is Almighty?</P>
<P>I TRUST that the&s;e Con&s;iderations will &s;ink deep in our Minds, and produce &s;uitable Effects. O let us not remain hardened under the cha&s;tening Hand of God, nor defeat his gracious De&s;igns to reclaim and &s;ave us. Sincerely lamenting our pa&s;t Sins, which have been committed again&s;t the cleare&s;t Light, the deare&s;t Love, and the mo&s;t tran&s;cendant Mercy, let us pro&s;trate our&s;elves before God, implore his Pardon, through the at|toning Merits of his ble&s;&s;ed Son; and firmly re|&s;olve, by his Grace, to amend hereafter, to fear him, and walk devoutly in his Ways.</P>
<P>WE &s;hould not re&s;t contented with a cold and barren A&s;&s;ent to the&s;e Things; for this could neither be plea&s;ing to God, nor profitable to us. We &s;hould actually reduce tho&s;e Truths, tho&s;e Re&s;olutions to Practice; and frequently a&s;k our|&s;elves. Whether the Purpo&s;es of God have been an&s;wered by his Vi&s;itation? Whether our evil Habits are weakened or broken&mdash;our Sins morti|fied
<PB N="38" REF="016810_0036_0F9E7EFC03368668">
and for&s;aken&mdash;our Virtues increa&s;ed and &s;trengthened? Whether we are more punctual, more con&s;cien&s;cious in the Di&s;charge of our Duty to God and Man? Whether we have advanced in Piety and Probity, under our Afflictions, and are become more humble, holy and re&s;igned? Whe|ther we <Q>deny our&s;elves, take up the Cro&s;s dai|ly, and follow our divine Ma&s;ter</Q> with more Ardour? Whether our Hearts be more weaned from the World, from its plea&s;ureable Enjoy|ments, and criminal Pur&s;uits? Whether we are more &s;en&s;ible of their In&s;ufficiency for our Happi|ne&s;s? And, in fine, whether our Affections are more &s;piritualized, more di&s;engaged from the fa&s;cinating Blandi&s;hments of this Life, and cen|tred in God.?</P>
<P>QUESTIONS of this Sort, &s;eriou&s;ly and repeat|edly urged, would be very beneficial; and I appeal to your Con&s;cience, whether the Go&s;pel does not require the&s;e Particulars of us&mdash;whe|ther each of them is not an e&s;pecial Duty in our pre&s;ent Situation? Evidently, it is by a religious Regard to the&s;e, and other like Chri&s;tian Duties, and by this <HI>only,</HI> that we can expect the Al|mighty will be reconciled to us; that he will remove our Calamities, call back the Sword from de&s;troying, bid Di&s;cord cea&s;e, and command Peace, with its attending Ble&s;&s;ings, to revi&s;it us. To &s;uch Amendment, his Promi&s;es of Mercy and Deliverance are explicit, numerous and peremp|tory; and he will be faithful to tho&s;e Promi&s;es. When &s;o many powerful Motives con&s;pire in re|commending this Line of Conduct, may I not flat|ter my&s;elf that you will pur&s;ue it?</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="016810_0037_0F9E7EFCA682F2A0">INFLUENCED by tho&s;e Motives, let us, in the Name of God, and in his Strength, re&s;olutely &s;et about this Conduct: Cheared with the plea&s;ing hope which re&s;ults from it, when pur&s;ued, let us look forward to that happy Period&mdash;not very di&s;|tant <HI>now,</HI> I tru&s;t&mdash;when we &s;hall return into the &s;oft Bo&s;om of Peace; when the Remembrance of pa&s;t Sufferings &s;hall &s;erve to enhance its Value, and in&s;pire us with the more Zeal to prai&s;e, and thank, and fear God, and to honour the King; when our mi&s;guided Brethren, cured of their Delu&s;ion, &s;hall be brought back to their Duty, and partake once more of the Benefits which, hitherto, they have too lightly regarded.
