<HEAD>THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES, AND PARTICULARLY OF PENNSYLVANIA, CONSIDERED, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE &s;overeignty and independence of the United States of America being e&s;tabli&s;hed, it becomes an object of the utmo&s;t importance to them to adopt, and &s;teadily to pur&s;ue, &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of national policy, as may mo&s;t effectually promote the pro&s;perity, &s;trength and duration of that e&s;tabli&s;hment. Nature has done her part for this ri&s;ing empire:&mdash;The wi&s;dom and virtue of its citizens mu&s;t accompli&s;h the re&s;t.</P>
<P>THE objects which conduce to the well-being of a people are &s;o numerous and extended, as to render the con&s;ideration of them all, a ta&s;k too great and too com|plex for an individual. A rational &s;cheme of civil polity, executed in a faithful admini&s;tration of government, is, doubtle&s;s, one of the mo&s;t momentous and e&s;&s;ential of the&s;e objects: but even this comprehends a great variety of intere&s;ting concerns. We &s;hall, therefore, confine our ob&s;ervations, in the cour&s;e of this E&s;&s;ay, to &s;ome of tho&s;e points which appear more peculiarly connected with the circum&s;tances of this country, and our national happine&s;s.</P>
<P>A CIVILIZED nation, without commerce, is a &s;ole|ci&s;m in politics. It is in the rude&s;t &s;tate of mankind
<PB N="2" REF="019498_0004_0FABADEE5F8FBE10">
only, that a people can exi&s;t, without any communica|tion with other &s;ocieties, or commercial intercour&s;e among them&s;elves, every one &s;upporting him&s;elf by his own labour. Indeed &s;o ab&s;olute a &s;tate of nature can only be conceived, but has &s;carcely exi&s;ted in reality. The wants, the fears, the weakne&s;s, nay the very nature of man, nece&s;&s;arily con&s;titute him a &s;ocial animal: And, in the very origin of &s;ociety, their mutual nece&s;&s;ities, with the various talents, means and opportunities of indivi|duals for &s;upplying them, mu&s;t have produced a recipro|city of &s;ervices, and an occa&s;ional interchange with one another of that property, which each had acquired by his own exertions.</P>
<P>COMMERCE may then be con&s;idered as coeval with man him&s;elf, and <HI>barter</HI> as its fir&s;t &s;tage.</P>
<P>IT is obvious, however, that the exchange of one kind of commodity for another mu&s;t have proved too imperfect a &s;pecies of traffic to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of &s;o|ciety, after civilization had multiplied their wants, and extended the objects of them beyond their mere <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ities.</HI></P>
<P>IN order, then, to remedy the inconvenience of barter, certain &s;ub&s;tances have been adopted, among&s;t the various nations of the earth, as the &s;cale or &s;tandard for mea&s;uring the value of every &s;pecies of property; thereby to a&s;cer|tain the relative worth of every commodity, compared with others, and with this common &s;tandard.</P>
<P>THE &s;ub&s;tances, mo&s;t univer&s;ally employed for this purpo&s;e, are <HI>&s;ilver</HI> and <HI>gold,</HI> though the former is e&s;teemed the &s;tandard. The&s;e metals po&s;&s;e&s;s an <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The value of the precious metals is, however, en|hanced, by their peculiar aptitude to perform the office of an <HI>univer&s;al money</HI> far beyond any real, <HI>inherent</HI> value they po&s;|&s;e&s;s. This <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> value of gold and &s;ilver, which belongs to them when under the modification of <HI>coin</HI> or in bullion, is totally di&s;tinct from their <HI>inherent</HI> value, as a <HI>commodity.</HI> For, as Dr. Franklin has ju&s;tly remarked, "gold and &s;ilver are not <HI>intrin&s;ically</HI> of equal value with iron, a metal in it&s;elf capable of many more beneficial u&s;es to mankind. Their value re&s;ts chiefly in the <HI>e&s;timation</HI> they happen to be in among the generality of nations, and the credit given to the opinion, that that e&s;timation will continue: Otherwi&s;e&punc; a pound of gold would not be a real equivalent for even a bu&s;hel of wheat." (See the Doctor's Remarks on a Repre|&s;entation from the Board of Trade to the King of Great-Britain, dated 9th February 1764.) We are apt to con|found the <HI>inherent</HI> value of the <HI>commodity</HI> with its <HI>extrin&s;ic</HI> value as a <HI>money</HI>; and to unite the two, in e&s;timating the <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> value of the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance.</HI> Whereas Bank-notes, or any other &s;pecies of <HI>&s;ymbolical</HI> money, may, under certain re|gulations, acquire that "e&s;timation" among a people, ne|ce&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute <HI>money,</HI> and to an&s;wer all the u&s;es of a <HI>circulating medium of alienation</HI> in a State.</NOTE> <HI>intrin&s;ic</HI> value,

by rea&s;on of their extraordinary purity and &s;carcene&s;s;&mdash; and certain other qualities render them &s;uitable materials for receiving &s;uch criteria, as that they may be readily di&s;tingui&s;hed, in the tran&s;actions of men, for <HI>that &s;tandard,</HI> whereby the relative worth of all commodities is a&s;cer|tained. The di&s;tingui&s;hing marks given, by the autho|rity and &s;anction of a State, to certain portions of metal, denominate them <HI>coin.</HI> The&s;e, which we call <HI>actual-money,</HI> are graduated (if we may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion) ac|cording to the proportion and quality of metal they con|tain, by an arbitrary &s;cale, termed <HI>money of account</HI>; which, in every country re&s;pectively, <Q>repre&s;ents an invariable &s;cale for mea&s;uring value.</Q></P>
<P>BUT it is to be ob&s;erved, that gold and &s;ilver coin de|rives not its intrin&s;ic value from performing the office <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"By money" (&s;ays &s;ir James Steuart) <Q>I under&s;tand <HI>any</HI> commodity, which, purely in it&s;elf, is of no mate|rial u&s;e to man, but which acquires &s;uch an <HI>e&s;timation</HI> from his opinion of it, as to become the univer&s;al mea|&s;ure of what is called value, and an adequate equivalent for any thing alienable.</Q> Political Oeconomy, Book I. ch. 6.</NOTE> of <HI>money</HI>; but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it as a <HI>commodity.</HI> For, as <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide his Ob&s;ervations on National Indu&s;try.</NOTE> Mr. Ander&s;on expre&s;&s;es it, <Q><HI>Money,</HI> con&s;idered in it&s;elf, is of no value.&mdash;But among civilized nations, who have found how convenient it is for facilitating the barter or exchange of one commodity for another, it has received an artificial value.&mdash;So that, although u&s;ele&s;s in it&s;elf, it has come to be accepted among all civilized nations, <HI>as a token proving that the per&s;on who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it had given &s;omething of real value in exchange for it</HI>;
<PB N="4" REF="019498_0006_0FABADF0DC873130">
and is, on that account, accepted of by another in exchange for &s;omething that is of real utility and in|trin&s;ic worth.</Q>&mdash;In &s;trictne&s;s, therefore, the em|ployment of gold and &s;ilver-coin, in alienation, is no more than bartering one commodity for another of equal value, or rather price. The intrin&s;ic value of &s;uch coin, does, in fact, render it in &s;ome degree an imperfect me|dium of alienation; for, being it&s;elf a commodity, it is liable to ri&s;e and fall in value, like every other article of commerce:&mdash; And, accordingly, we find that the price of &s;ilver is continually varying in the London market; and the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India Company &s;end &s;ilver to China, in order to purcha&s;e gold.</P>
<P>THUS money, formed of the precious metals, may be con&s;idered in a two-fold point of view&mdash;as a merchant|able commodity, and as a medium of alienation. In the former capacity, it adds to the riches of a country, merely in proportion to its intrin&s;ic value: But, <HI>as mo|ney,</HI> it can no otherwi&s;e produce this effect, than paper or leather-money, or any other <HI>&s;ign</HI> of property.</P>
<P>IF we recur to the original u&s;e of <HI>money,</HI>&mdash;as an <HI>in&s;tru|ment</HI> by the intervention of which alienation might be effected, and the nece&s;&s;ity of barter &s;uper&s;eded,&mdash;it mu&s;t appear evident, that we judge very erroneou&s;ly, when we &s;uppo&s;e <HI>intrin&s;ic value</HI> to be in&s;eparably connected with it. At the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that &s;pecies of money, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es <HI>intrin&s;ic value,</HI> has one ad|vantage that does not appertain to <HI>&s;ymbolical</HI> money; namely, that being it&s;elf a merchantable commodity, it may be <HI>bartered,</HI> at a <HI>foreign</HI> market, for other commo|dities. This advantage, however, as &s;hall be &s;hewn in the &s;equel, is not more than equivalent to tho&s;e that are deducible from a well founded <HI>&s;ymbolical</HI> money, which is capable of an&s;wering all the <HI>dome&s;tic</HI> and <HI>internal</HI> purpo&s;es of a <HI>circulating medium</HI> in a nation.</P>
<P>FROM what has been premi&s;ed we may infer, that <HI>mo|ney,</HI> in its <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>"Money</HI> is an univer&s;al medium, or common &s;tandard, by a compari&s;on with which the value of all merchanci&s;e may be a&s;certained; or it is a <HI>&s;ign</HI> which repre&s;ents the real value of all commodities."

<HI>&s;ign, token,</HI> or <HI>repre&s;entative</HI> of it. The ab&s;olute riches of a country con&s;i&s;t in the abundance of tho&s;e productions of nature, that mini&s;ter directly to the &s;upport, the con|veniency, and the enjoyment of mankind. Where na|ture has be&s;towed the&s;e gifts with a liberal hand, the na|tion, collectively, may ju&s;tly be termed rich, though de&s;titute of money: On the other hand, where the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings appear to have been dealt out to a people in a more &s;paring manner, they are comparatively poor, not|with&s;tanding their country may abound with gold and &s;ilver-mines. For if we con&s;ider the former country as totally unconnected with any other; it is evident that the wants of all its inhabitants may be &s;upplied by the means of bartering; but if we place the other in the &s;ame un|connected &s;tate, it is equally plain, that their gold and &s;ilver can be of little u&s;e to them;&mdash;the <HI>real, inherent</HI> worth of tho&s;e metals being very &s;mall, and the country deficient in tho&s;e things which con&s;titute <HI>true</HI> and <HI>&s;ub|&s;tantial riches.</HI>&mdash;In the one ca&s;e, the nece&s;&s;ity of bar|tering among them&s;elves is attended with inconvenience. In the other, the &s;carcity or want of the nece&s;&s;ary articles them&s;elves, excludes, in a great degree, the po&s;&s;ibility of barter and the u&s;e of money, and occa&s;ions proportion|able di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>LET us now view each of the&s;e countries as opening a commercial intercour&s;e with the other and with foreign nations.&mdash;The wealthier country, by exporting the &s;uperfluous quantity of its produce, would be enabled to procure in return, either gold and &s;ilver, or &s;uch other commodities as they might require to &s;upply tho&s;e <HI>arti|ficial</HI> wants, which refinement of manners may have created. Thus the wealthy State might increa&s;e its riches.</P>
<P>BUT the poorer country would be obliged to &s;end abroad their gold and &s;ilver, to purcha&s;e a &s;ufficiency of tho&s;e articles which their more immediate nece&s;&s;ities might require. Should the quantity of the&s;e metals, fur|ni&s;hed by &s;uch a country, be only adequate for this pur|po&s;e, its inhabitants would certainly continue poor; or, if the quantity &s;hould be &s;o great as to introduce among&s;t

<P>HENCE we &s;ee that the <HI>real</HI> riches of a nation do not con&s;i&s;t in money; but that they may &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it.</P>
<P>COMMERCE and money are &s;o intimately connected, that, to form a ju&s;t idea of either, we &s;hould con&s;ider both. The former, as we have already ob&s;erved, origi|nated from the nece&s;&s;ities of mankind; the latter was in|vented as an expedient, for conducting the operations of the other with the greater facility, by removing the dif|ficulties and inconveniencies of barter. <HI>Commerce,</HI> con&s;i&s;t|ing in the continual exchange and mutual transfer of tho&s;e things among&s;t men, which their re&s;pective wants, whe|ther natural or artificial, have rendered de&s;irable; and the u&s;e of <HI>money</HI> being introduced, as the medium or in|&s;trument by which this was to be effected; it follows, that the&s;e two objects &s;hould bear a due proportion to each other. The more exten&s;ive the alienation of pro|perty is in any country, the greater will be the quantity of money, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> requi&s;ite for carrying it on.</P>
<P>HENCE we may trace the fallacy of that opinion, maintained by &s;ome, that it is immaterial, whether the quantity of money in a nation be great or &s;mall, as the value of all the labour and commodities within it, taken together, mu&s;t be equal to the whole &s;um of its money. &mdash;Were &s;uch a nation cut off from all communication with every other, there might be &s;ome truth in the po&s;i|tion:
<PB N="7" REF="019498_0009_0FABADF2E7952208">
But as money is a medium, not only of the inter|nal commerce of every nation, &s;eparately con&s;idered; but of their commercial intercour&s;e, one with another; it is plain that the quantity of this <HI>univer&s;al</HI> medium in each country mu&s;t not only bear a certain proportion to the alienation within that country, but the entire quantity therein mu&s;t al&s;o be in a relative ratio to the quantities in all the other trading countries of the world between whom there is an intercour&s;e, collectively, compared with the amount of the alienation in them all.</P>
<P>A COMMERCIAL intercour&s;e between nations would have a tendency to give to each a quantity of this univer|&s;al medium, proportionate to its &s;hare in &s;uch negociations. But either the natural advantages, or tho&s;e re&s;ulting from political in&s;titutions, which one country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es above another, de&s;troy this kind of equilibrium in the commerce of nations, and create that difference which con&s;titutes one rich and another <HI>relatively</HI> poor: &mdash; The manner in which this effect may be produced, has been briefly pointed out.</P>
<P>AS the riches of a country do not <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> depend on the quantity of money it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; but on the extent and productivene&s;s of its lands, the number and indu&s;try of its inhabitants, and the plenty and intrin&s;ic value of its natural produce&mdash;the abundance or &s;carcity of the&s;e denominate it <HI>really</HI> rich or poor. And as the ali|enation and interchanging of the&s;e <HI>real</HI> riches of a coun|try con&s;titute its trade; the utility and indeed nece&s;&s;ity of employing &s;ome &s;ub&s;tance which may <HI>repre&s;ent</HI> the&s;e riches, as the <HI>medium</HI> of transfer, demon&s;trate likewi&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"If a nation has a quantity of money equal to its com|merce, the lands, commodities and labor of the people &s;hall bear a middle price.

Attorney-General of Penn|&s;ylvania.</NOTE> proportioning that medium to the de|gree of alienation, according to the great commercial &s;cale of price and value.</P>

<P>THIS, indeed, is the chief preeminence which gold and &s;ilver po&s;&s;e&s;s, as a circulating medium of trade, over &s;ymbolical money. In many re&s;pects they are inferior to it. The immen&s;e quantities of the&s;e <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir William Black&s;tone tells us, that above a thou&s;and millions of bullion are calculated to have been imported in|to Europe from America, within le&s;s than three centuries; and the quantity is daily increa&s;ing.</NOTE> metals which are continually procured from the bowels of the earth, and introduced into the dealings of men, under the mo|dification of <HI>coin,</HI> render them, in &s;ome degree, impro|per sub&s;tances to be the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"No material money, let it be contrived as it will, is exempted from vici&s;&s;itudes in its value as a metal.

<P>IF we take a retro&s;pective view of our &s;ubject, this inference may be deduced&mdash;that the principal u&s;e of <HI>coin,</HI> is the enabling a nation the more ea&s;ily to pay an unfavorable balance on its foreign trade.

<P><PB N="9" REF="019498_0011_0FABADF597561730">IT being evident, that a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Penn&s;ylvania, before they made any <HI>Paper-money,</HI> was wholly &s;tript of its gold and &s;ilver, though they had from time to time, like the neighbouring colonies, agreed to take gold and &s;ilver coins at higher and higher nominal va|lues, in hopes of drawing money into, and retaining it for the internal u&s;e of, the province. During this weak prac|tice, &s;ilver got up by degrees to 8/9 an ounce, and Engli&s;h crowns were 6, 7, and 8/ pieces, long before Paper-money was made.

<P>THAT exce&s;s of the <HI>real</HI> riches of any country which belong to its inhabitants, beyond what their own u&s;e and con&s;umption may need, is as unprofitable to the proprie|tors, without the means of alienation; as trea&s;ure, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mi&s;er, is u&s;ele&s;s to his neighbour: In both ca&s;es, it is the <HI>alienation</HI> of the property that con|tributes to its value.

Money being the <HI>repre&s;entative</HI> of <HI>real value,</HI> the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it denotes, that the owner had given &s;ome equivalent for it. Therefore, as the acqui&s;ition of <HI>money</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;ub&s;equent to the means of ac|quiring it, tho&s;e <HI>means</HI> (which mu&s;t have con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ome of the con&s;tituents of real riches, equivalent to the money) mu&s;t have been obtained by the aid of a <HI>credit.</HI> As <HI>coin,</HI> or real money, as it is &s;ometimes &s;tiled, is con|&s;idered as the repre&s;entative of <HI>actual, coexi&s;tent</HI> value; &s;o <HI>credit</HI> may be &s;aid to repre&s;ent <HI>anticipated</HI> value;&mdash;and <HI>&s;ymbolical</HI> or <HI>paper-money</HI> may be termed the <HI>evidence</HI> or <HI>token</HI> of credit:&mdash;Hence this kind of currency is deno|minated paper-credit or bills of credit.&mdash;The obvious u&s;e of credit is to &s;upply the place of actual money. It fur|ni&s;hes a mode of conducting the operations of alienation or commerce, without the immediate intervention of money or occa&s;ion of barter. But being u&s;ed merely as a &s;ub&s;titute for actual money, it &s;hould be regulated by the &s;ame &s;cale: and this evinces the propriety of a State not i&s;&s;uing a greater &s;um in a <HI>paper-money</HI> (which is the <HI>evidence of credit)</HI> than is wanted to &s;upply the deficiency of its actual money; &s;o that the amount of its coin and paper-credit might form a &s;um &s;ufficient for its aliena|tion. If, therefore, tho&s;e things that con&s;titute real riches, abound in a country where there is little coin, that country will need a large &s;upply of paper-credit to repre&s;ent that proportion of its riches which the di&s;pro|portionate quantity of its coin could not effect, in or|der to enable it to carry on an alienation adequate to its riches.</P>
<P>AS too exten&s;ive a credit mu&s;t needs operate in a manner &s;imilar to the circulation of too much money, the great end to be obtained, with re&s;pect to this point, is, to determine on the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible <HI>&s;tandard</HI> for a&s;cer|taining

So that, if the circu|lating medium of a country be duly proportioned to its commerce, and if that medium or money will yield an average profit of <HI>&s;ix per centum per annum,</HI> to tho&s;e who make u&s;e of it, the value of lands in that country may be e&s;timated at about &s;ixteen years purcha&s;e: On the &s;ame principle the intere&s;t of money is regulated, by a compari&s;on with the productive value of labor and lands. This &s;ugge&s;ts the u&s;e of a well-regulated <HI>credit</HI>; which, by operating as &s;tock, augments the profit on the actual capital employed in conjunction with it.</P>
<P>HERE we trace the beneficial effect of the credit ob|tained by the agriculturi&s;t from a loan-office, in a &s;ym|bolical money. The lands, in an improved country only, can be valued at any certain number of years pur|cha&s;e. But in this new country, the progre&s;&s;ive im|provement of the lands from year to year, is continually increa&s;ing the capital of the landholder. And this effect,&mdash;this immen&s;e &s;ource of national wealth and fund of credit,&mdash;will not cea&s;e, until the cultivation of our lands &s;hall have arrived at &s;uch a height and become &s;o general, as that the annual profits of farming will not &s;urpa&s;s the intere&s;t of money. The very low <HI>price</HI> which improvable lands bear in this country, is no criterion of their <HI>value</HI>; but ari&s;es &s;olely from the in&s;ufficiency of the <HI>means</HI> nece&s;&s;ary for acquiring and improving them; for an uncultivated &s;oil is of as little u&s;e, as a diamond in the bo&s;om of the mine.</P>
<P>As money derives its value from its <HI>u&s;es,</HI> it is evident, that, when the quantity does not exceed tho&s;e u&s;es, its value will not be impaired. The difficulty, with re&s;pect to a &s;ymbolical money in general, is to a&s;certain the <HI>pro|ductivene&s;s</HI> and to &s;ecure the <HI>certainty</HI> of the <HI>fund,</HI> which creates the u&s;es. <HI>Taxes</HI> are a &s;ufficient fund for &s;upport|ing the credit of a paper-money, provided due regard be had to the&s;e e&s;&s;ential points. The credit of paper i&s;&s;ued by <HI>Banks</HI> founded entirely on mercantile credit, in tho&s;e com|mercial countries which enjoy a favorable balance of trade,

may al&s;o be rendered &s;ufficiently &s;table, by prudence and circum&s;pection in the managers. But in both in&s;tances, neither can the productivene&s;s of the fund be a&s;certained, nor its certainty be &s;ecured, by any real &s;tandard. The operations of a merely mercantile Bank are, in a peculiar manner, liable to extend credit beyond its proper bounds, in countries which carry on a di&s;advantageous foreign trade: becau&s;e the intere&s;t of the proprietors will lead them to circulate a fictitious money, in their paper-cre|dit, to as large an amount as they may &s;uppo&s;e con&s;i&s;tent with their own &s;afety; and this very credit adds to the means of accelerating that trade, already prejudicial to the nation. The notes of &s;uch a Bank are i&s;&s;ued on <HI>mer|cantile</HI> credit. "This," &s;ays Sir James Steuart, "is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed upon the <HI>confidence</HI> the lender has, that the bor|rower, from his integrity and knowledge in trade, may be able to replace the capital advanced, and the intere&s;t due during the advance, in terms of the agreement." It is this kind of credit that the &s;ame author &s;tiles, <Q>the mo&s;t precarious of all.</Q></P>
<P>THE great temptations that lie in the way of Banks on mercantile credit, on the one hand, and of States on the other, to i&s;&s;ue their paper on their re&s;pective funds of <HI>mere confidence,</HI> in too great quantities; by over-rating the productivene&s;s of tho&s;e <HI>anticipated funds</HI> on which that <HI>confidence</HI> is grounded (and which are, nece&s;&s;arily, &s;ubject to &s;ome uncertainty, from the nature of them)&mdash;tho&s;e very circum&s;tances tend to render the <HI>credit</HI> of <HI>&s;uch</HI> paper very delicate.</P>
<P>BUT that &s;pecies of <HI>paper-money,</HI> that is i&s;&s;ued on the &s;ecurity of <HI>lands,</HI> which are made an actual equivalent <HI>depo&s;it</HI> for its redemption, from the moment of its going into circulation, is not liable to any objections on this &s;core. The <HI>fund it&s;elf,</HI> that is, the land, is actually exi&s;ting; and the credit, e&s;tabli&s;hed on it, repre&s;ents the value of <HI>this</HI> fund, and not of the <HI>anticipated profits</HI> to be derived from the employment of it. The more firmly to e&s;tabli&s;h the credit of a <HI>loan-office</HI> money, no per&s;on can borrow from the State more than one half the e&s;timated value of his land: And in order to di&s;&s;eminate the advantages of this credit the more exten&s;ively, and to enhance its u&s;efulne&s;s, mo|derate &s;ums only (not exceeding, perhaps, two hundred pounds) are loaned to individuals, let the value of their

lands be what they may;&mdash;by which means, this in&s;ti|tutition is peculiarly adapted to benefit the new &s;ettlers and le&s;&s;er proprietors of lands, a cla&s;s of people who mo&s;t &s;tand in need of encouragement in this country.</P>
<P>THIS kind of money, being e&s;tabli&s;hed on permanent and certain funds, is extremely well calculated not only for a circulating medium within the particular State which i&s;&s;ues it, but al&s;o as a medium of trade between the &s;everal States; for, as Sir James Stuart ob&s;erves, <Q>it is the intere&s;t of every trading State to have a &s;uf|ficient quantity of paper, <HI>well-&s;ecured,</HI> to circulate through it, &s;o as to facilitate payments every where, and to cut off inland exchanges, which are a great clog upon trade, and are attended with the ri&s;que of receiving the paper of people, who&s;e credit is but doubtful.</Q></P>
<P>IT is a trite objection to paper-money, that it ba|ni&s;hes gold and &s;ilver from the country where it ob|tains. This has been often invalidated. Dr. Frank|lin (in his remarks on the report, &amp;c.) has &s;hewn, that it is an <HI>unfavorable balance of trade</HI> that draws the gold and &s;ilver out of the country, and that the "nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ub&s;tituting &s;ome medium in their &s;tead has induced the making of paper-money which could not be drawn away." So far is the paper-money the cau&s;e of this ef|fect, that, by increa&s;ing alienation and the means of exciting indu&s;try, it has a direct tendency to increa&s;e the &s;tock of coin ih the country. And, as the quantity of paper-money in a country will not &s;uffer any dimi|nution of its value while it does not exceed its <HI>u&s;es,</HI> this currency can have no effect in rai&s;ing the price of labor and commodities, while kept within tho&s;e bounds.</P>
<P>A LOAN-OFFICE money being employed in the im|provement of lands becomes <HI>reali&s;ed</HI> in a &s;pecies of pro|perty which, in the&s;e &s;tates, is productive of much greater emoluments, both to the public and to the pro|prietors, than can be derived from the u&s;e of &s;mall mo|nied capitals, in any manner of trade, honorable to an individual, or con&s;i&s;tent with the common weal.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time that the cultivator of the &s;oil is, by this means, enriching him&s;elf, and increa&s;ing the <HI>real</HI> wealth of his country in a direct point of view, other &s;alutary con&s;equences re&s;ult from a <HI>loan-office</HI> credit. Its circulating paper, by filling up the cha&s;m in the medium

of alienation, occa&s;ioned by the &s;carcity of coin, encou|rages indu&s;try and genius, promotes arts and manufac|tures; enlivens commerce, gives the means of comfort|able &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the poor, and enables all cla&s;&s;es of people to contribute to the &s;upport of Government and e&s;tabli&s;hment of public credit, by a regular and liberal payment of taxes. Indeed the revenue that might be obtained from the intere&s;t on a loan-office money, would, of it&s;elf, form a very con&s;iderable fund, applicable to public u&s;es.</P>
<P>THE numerous and important advantages, accruing from this kind of in&s;titution, are by no means exaggerated. On the contrary, a little reflection will &s;ugge&s;t, to any per&s;on acquainted with this country, many other in&s;tances wherein its operations mu&s;t be extremely &s;erviceable: But the nature of the in&s;titution need to be only under|&s;tood to demon&s;trate its utility.&mdash;Neither is it a &s;cheme founded on mere theoretical principles, as the experience of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See note page 9.</NOTE> Penn&s;ylvania can te&s;tify: She, as well as &s;ome of her &s;i&s;ter States, has heretofore felt the invigorating influence of this cheering political &s;un.&mdash;May it &s;peedily ari&s;e to re-enlighten this we&s;tern world; and, by dif|fu&s;ing its benign rays throughout our infant empire, quicken the feeds of indu&s;try, art, manufactures, and commerce!</P>
<P>IF we compare the nature and effects of this <HI>loan-office</HI> money with the paper circulated by a mercantile Bank, how great is the contra&s;t!&mdash;We have &s;hewn in what manner the circum&s;tances of this country require an in|crea&s;ing currency; while, at the &s;ame time, the unfavor|able balance of its foreign trade is continually draining away its coin.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">"The only occa&s;ion where <HI>coin</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary in the li|quidation of <HI>paper,</HI> is for payment of the balance of trade with foreign nations.&mdash;But &s;urely nothing is &s;o ill judged as to erect an imaginary balance within the &s;ame &s;tate; or, ra|ther, to permit money-jobbers to erect it, at the expence of rai&s;ing intere&s;t, and hurting trade, in the very places where it &s;tands in the greate&s;t need of encouragement."

<P>WHEN we con&s;ider for what purpo&s;es a credit is u&s;e|ful and nece&s;&s;ary, in this country, we mu&s;t be convinced that <HI>that</HI> &s;pecies of it which is furni&s;hed by a mercantile Bank, is &s;o far from an&s;wering the end, that it has a direct tendency to defeat it. The u&s;e of credit being to &s;upply the place of real funds, it is obvious that it can only prove beneficial to a nation, when tho&s;e funds are employed in promoting and extending &s;uch branches of its commerce as tend to enrich it, by increa&s;ing its ex|ports and dimini&s;hing its imports. This is the effect produced by the paper-credit, created by Government, by means of a loan-office.</P>
<P>BUT a mercantile Bank cannot lend on any other &s;e|curity than mere confidence, grounded on opinion only. The farmer, who is de&s;irous of borrowing a little pe|cuniary capital towards enabling him to improve or cul|tivate his e&s;tate, cannot obtain a farthing from the Bank, on the &s;ecurity of his lands, be their value what they may: Whil&s;t the merchant, who&s;e property is of the mo&s;t pre|carious and delu&s;ive nature, may readily procure a ficti|tious capital to facilitate his importation of foreign mer|chandi&s;e. Thus, the farmer being excluded from this credit, with which the importer is &s;o ea&s;ily accommo|dated, the balance of trade again&s;t the country will in|crea&s;e by the very means which ought to operate in its favor.</P>
<P>WHO, then, are to be benefited by this Bank?&mdash; We have &s;een that the farmer is not; neither are the people at large. The State might, indeed, be occa&s;ionally obliged and indulged with favors from the directors: But, we would a&s;k, would it be con&s;i&s;tent with the dig|nity, the intere&s;t, nay the <HI>&s;afety</HI> of Government, to lay them&s;elves under obligations to, and render them&s;elves dependent on a private trading company?&mdash;Every in|dependent man will an&s;wer&mdash;No. The State has funds of credit of a much &s;uperior kind; and is not under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmitting to &s;uch an indignity. The only cla&s;s of people who could derive any advantage from a mercantile Bank among us, would be tho&s;e connected with the in&s;titution it&s;elf; except, perhaps, in &s;ome com|paratively few in&s;tances. The wrong balance of our
<PB N="20" REF="019498_0022_0FABAE00618E2A08">
trade, by increa&s;ing the demand for money, would rai&s;e the price above its value as a circulating medium and common &s;tandard. And, by this means, the &s;tock|holders might draw an intere&s;t on their Bank property, far beyond its ju&s;t level. We have already &s;een the Bank in Philadelphia making a dividend to the proprietors of its funds, of more than double the legal intere&s;t of money. It is not, therefore, to be wondered, that &s;ome of the&s;e proprietors, e&s;pecially tho&s;e mo&s;t intimately con|nected with the in&s;titution, &s;hould be extremely anxious to &s;upport what is &s;o very &s;ub&s;ervient to their private intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>BUT let us turn our attention to the tendency of this Bank, in &s;ome other re&s;pects.&mdash;The farmer can bor|row nothing from thence.&mdash;When he applies to a mo|nied man for a loan from his private fortune, on the &s;e|curity of his lands, he cannot &s;ucceed; becau&s;e no per|&s;on will lend his money even on landed &s;ecurity, at &s;ix per cent per annum, while he can inve&s;t it in a fund which will yield him twice that intere&s;t. What then mu&s;t be the con&s;equence? The farmer, finding him&s;elf un|able, with all his toil, to cultivate his lands to any advan|tage, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome credit; being debar|red from the acqui&s;ition of it; and ob&s;erving the &s;uperior emoluments derived from banking, without any labour; &s;ells his lands, and becomes a Bank-&s;tockholder. This inducement will have a general operation, and the &s;ame cau&s;e which leads the farmer to &s;ell, produces a disincli|nation in the monied man to purcha&s;e, landed e&s;tates: Con&s;equently, the value of lands mu&s;t &s;ink; and agricul|ture, the great &s;upport of our country, mu&s;t decline.</P>
<P>NOT only the cultivation of lands is ob&s;tructed by the&s;e means, but al&s;o the improvement and exten&s;ion of our ci|ties and towns. Many who po&s;&s;e&s;s unimproved town-lots would erect hou&s;es on them, if, by mortgaging their ground, they could obtain money for the purpo&s;e; but the Bank renders this impracticable. Even monied men, who own property of this kind, will not employ it in build|ing, when bank-&s;tock will afford them greater profits than the rents of hou&s;es, on the &s;ame amount of fund. In this manner, the Bank has a direct tendency to keep hou&s;e-rent high; and to prevent the employment of ma|&s;ons, carpenters, &s;miths, and all that numerous and u&s;e|ful body of mechanics, who derive their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, al|mo&s;t
<PB N="21" REF="019498_0023_0FABAE0234DDB8D0">
wholly, from the con&s;truction of hou&s;es. The pro|prietors of hou&s;es in Philadelphia were formerly very well &s;atisfied to receive the legal intere&s;t of their money in rents; but, while twelve per cent per annum can be ob|tained by banking, the landlord may exact double rent for his hou&s;e. Yet were he to &s;ell it, he would probably not procure more than the capital of the legal intere&s;t. So that the Bank may be ju&s;tly con&s;idered as an auxiliary cau&s;e of our exorbitant rents; a circum&s;tance &s;o grievous to the tenants, &s;o nece&s;&s;arily productive of the high price of labor among our arti&s;ans and mechanics, and &s;o pre|judicial to the whole community.&mdash;In &s;hort, &s;uch a train of evils re&s;ult from the <HI>high intere&s;t of money,</HI> alone, that its baneful effects may be traced every where, and every cla&s;s of our citizens mu&s;t ultimately experience them. A few monied men and private individuals derive, indeed, an immediate benefit from this &s;ource; but the cultivator of the &s;oil, the indu&s;trious manufacture and mechanic, in fact the State it&s;elf, become inevitably &s;ufferers.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to conceive, why per&s;ons, who have em|barked their funds in the Bank, are &s;o aver&s;e to a cur|rency i&s;&s;ued by Government. In proportion to the &s;carcity of money, will be the demand for credit; and while the Bank can monopolize this credit, it may al&s;o monopolize the emoluments accruing from it. Any competition with the proprietors of the Bank would le&s;&s;en their profits; and, for that rea&s;on, will be oppo&s;ed. This oppo&s;ition to a State paper-money was exhibited in a &s;triking manner by the friends and &s;upporters of the Bank, when the Legi&s;lature were about i&s;&s;uing the bills of credit now in circulation; but, notwith&s;tanding the fears that were &s;ugge&s;ted of its depreciation, the &s;uffi|ciency of the funds appropriated for their redemption have fully &s;upported their credit.</P>
<P>IF it be the intere&s;t of the State to i&s;&s;ue a paper-cur|rency, which, we pre&s;ume, is incontrovertible; and if the primary object of the Bank, namely its own immediate profit, be incompatible with the intere&s;t of the State, in that particular, is it not rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that every &s;pecies of <HI>influence</HI> which the Bank po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, will be exerted again&s;t &s;o advantageous and nece&s;&s;ary a mea&s;ure of Government?&mdash;Apprehen&s;ions of an undue exerci&s;e of influence from &s;o powerful and uncontroul|able

a combination of property in private hands cannot, therefore, be ill-grounded, in the infant &s;tate of our public credit. Such apprehen&s;ions have exi&s;ted in old, trading nations, where the con&s;equences could not prove &s;o dangerous to the State.&mdash;When the Briti&s;h Parlia|ment extended the term, for which the Bank of England held its charter, only ten years beyond its ordinary dura|tion of twenty-one years, Mr. David Hartley &s;ounded the alarm; and, in his letter of the 22d of June, 1781, to the Lord Mayor of London, on that occa&s;ion, (pub|li&s;hed in Almon's Remembrancer for that year) has pointed out the injurious tendency, with re&s;pect to Government, of the additional influence given to the Bank, by that mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>IN the year 1721, an attempt was wade to in&s;titute a Bank in Ireland. Upon that occa&s;ion, the Hou&s;e of Commons, by a majority of 150 to 80, "re&s;olved, that the erecting or e&s;tabli&s;hing of a public Bank in that kingdom would be of the mo&s;t dangerous and fatal con|&s;equences to his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, and the trade and li|berties of the nation." Addre&s;&s;ing the King on this &s;ubject, they &s;ay, "As this was a matter of univer&s;al and national concern, your dutiful Commons took the &s;ame into their mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration, and not find|ing any &s;olid or good foundation for e&s;tabli&s;hing a pub|lic Bank, &s;o as to be beneficial to the nation, or even con&s;i&s;tent with the welfare or liberties of it, think them|&s;elves obliged in duty to your Maje&s;ty, and ju&s;tice to them&s;elves and tho&s;e whom they repre&s;ent, to offer their humble opinion to your Maje&s;ty, that the e&s;tabli&s;hing of any public Bank in this Kingdom, will be greatly prejudicial to your Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, and of mo&s;t dan|gerous and pernicious con&s;equence to the welfare and liberty of this nation.

<P>COMMERCE is &s;o intimately connected with money, that the importance of a well regulated commercial &s;y&s;tem is to obvious to need any comment.

<P>WHEN the circulating medium bears a due proportion to the alienation, or, in other words, the commerce, of a nation, the <HI>cour&s;e of exchange,</HI> may ju&s;tly be deemed the criterion of the &s;tate of its <HI>foreign</HI> trade. If the balance be adver&s;e, exchange will be high; and if it be favorable, bills will be low. For &s;hould the commodities imported into a country exceed in value tho&s;e exported from it, in any given time, the demand for bills would rai&s;e their price above the par of exchange; and the exports &s;urpa&s;|&s;ing the imports would produce a contrary effect. But if the exce&s;s of the latter were &s;o far to overbalance the former, as to render the remittance of bills more unpro|fitable than that of gold and &s;ilver; <HI>coin</HI> and bullion would then be exported to pay the balance due to the foreign country.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="019498_0026_0FABAE05048BAA70">THIS, as we have before ob&s;erved, is the u&s;e of <HI>coin,</HI> and the cau&s;e of the &s;uperior worth attributed to it in the capacity of a money.

Thus will the profits on that trade, now enjoyed by &s;trangers, center with our own citizens; while this new channel of commerce will employ an additional number of American &s;hipping and &s;eamen, and furni&s;h a vent for an article, the natural pro|duction of this country, much e&s;teemed in the Ea&s;t.</NOTE> &s;ome in&s;tances, certain kinds of mer|chandi&s;e ought, perhaps, to be exonerated from all duties, whether imported in American or foreign bottoms: But in other ca&s;es, &s;uch exemption might properly be re&s;tricted to goods imported in American ve&s;&s;els only.</P>
<P>BUT a very obvious and important reflection ari&s;es here:&mdash;And that is, that every effort which can be made by individual States, for placing our foreign trade on an advantageous footing for this country, is liable to be fru&s;trated, by other States counteracting them, or not coinciding in &s;imilar mea&s;ures. The want of that <HI>uniformity,</HI> which is nece&s;&s;ary to give efficiency and per|manency

to the commercial &s;y&s;tem of a nation, will ren|der, in a great degree, ineffectual, all partial regulations for the advancement of our trade. A power mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be lodged <HI>&s;omewhere,</HI> for adju&s;ting the com|mercial, as well as the political, intere&s;ts of the &s;everal States in the Union, to <HI>one general &s;cale</HI>; and, according to the principles on which our foederal Con&s;titution is framed, this power ought to be ve&s;ted in the SUPREME HEAD OF THE UNION, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h the com|merce of the United States on the &s;olid ba&s;is of <HI>national</HI> &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, the un&s;ettled &s;tate of our foreign trade lays us under a double obligation a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to promote our <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>By rai&s;ing large flocks of &s;heep, &s;ufficient quantities of wool may be &s;upplied for the manufacturing of coar&s;e wool|len cloths, &s;tockings, common hats, &amp;c.&mdash;Hemp furni&s;hes us with the valuable article of cordage; and flax-&s;eed, which is a con&s;iderable export from this country, yields an oil that is applied to various u&s;eful purpo&s;es: A large &s;up|ply of coar&s;e and middling linen cloths may al&s;o be drawn from hemp and flax, &s;uch as &s;ail-duck, &s;acking, oznabrigs, &s;heeting, and the like.&mdash;Virginia and North-Carolina grow cotton of a very good quality, which may be manufactured into various kinds of clothing, &amp;c. Thread and cotton &s;tock|ings, of an excellent fabric, have long been made &agrave;mong us. The &s;ine hats of this country are much &s;uperior to any imported.&mdash;All manufactures of leather may be carried on to the greate&s;t advantage.&mdash;Iron (be&s;ides excellent ca&s;tings and the manufacture of &s;teel) may likewi&s;e be wrought into all kinds of heavy work, and into nails and &s;undry other arti|cles, much to the benefit of the country.&mdash;Paper is already made here, of an excellent quality and in large quantities.

The United-States occupy a va&s;t extent of fertile coun|try, lying in various climates, yielding the nece&s;&s;aries of life in the utmo&s;t abundance, and furni&s;hing a great diver&s;ity of commodities, and raw materials for manu|facturing.</P>
<P>THE commercial intercour&s;e carried on between the &s;everal States, by &s;ea, &s;hould be re&s;tricted to American ve&s;&s;els; and the communication from one part of the country to another, inland, ought to be rendered as ea&s;y and convenient as po&s;&s;ible, by improving the roads, opening canals, and removing all ob&s;tructions to the navigation of the rivers, where practicable,&mdash;in order to facilitate and promote the interior commerce of the United-States.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="019498_0033_0FABAE0C91F605C0">THE influence of example, manners and fa&s;hion, may al&s;o greatly contribute to our &s;ucce&s;s, in the pur|&s;uit of the&s;e great objects of national pro&s;perity.

<P>WE have endeavoured, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e ob|&s;ervations, to fix the public attention on &s;ome of tho&s;e momentous concerns, on which the pro&s;perity of this country &s;o much depends.

But the rea&s;oning, &s;o far as it goes, will, we apprehend, be fully &s;atisfactory to every di&s;intere&s;ted and unprejudiced reader.&mdash;</P>
