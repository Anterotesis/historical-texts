<Q>So &s;hall he do, he &s;hall even return, and have Intelligence with them that for&s;ake the holy Covenant.&mdash;And &s;uch as do wickedly again&s;t the Cove|nant, &s;hall be corrupt by Flatteries.</Q>

<P>THE cruel Tyrant here intended was ANTIOCHUS EPIPHANES, the little Horn in Daniel's Vi&s;ion, Chap. VIII. 9,&mdash;12. <Q>And out of one of them came forth a little Horn, which waxed exceeding great toward the South, and toward the Ea&s;t, and toward the plea&s;ant Land. And it waxed great even to the Ho&s;t of Heaven; and it ca&s;t down &s;ome of the Ho&s;t, and of the Stars to the Ground, and &s;tamped upon them. Yea he mag|nified him&s;elf even to the Prince of the Ho&s;t, and by him the daily Sacrifice was taken away, and the Place of his Sanctuary was ca&s;t down. And an Ho&s;t was given him again&s;t the daily Sacrifice, by Rea&s;on of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and it ca&s;t down the Truth to the Ground, and it practi&s;ed and pro&s;pered.</Q> This is explained to the Prophet by the Angel, <HI>That in the latter Time of their Kingdom, when the Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors are come to the full, a King of fierce Countenance, and Under&s;tanding dark Sentences, &s;hall &s;tand up. And his Power &s;hall be mighty, but not by his own Power; and he &s;hall de&s;troy wonderfully, and &s;hall pro&s;per and practi&s;e, and &s;hall de&s;troy the mighty, and the holy People. And through his Policy al&s;o he &s;hall cau&s;e Craft to pro&s;per in his Hand, and he &s;hall magnify him&s;elf on his Heart, and by Peace &s;hall de&s;troy many: He &s;hall al&s;o &s;tand up again&s;t the Prince of Princes; but he &s;hall be broken without Hand.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ver.</HI> 23, 24, 25.</NOTE></P>

Tyrant <HI>for&s;ook the holy Covenant,</HI> the Covenant of the LORD GOD of their Fathers, and the Covenant they them&s;elves had made to &s;erve the Lord, to keep his Laws, and maintain the Rights and Privileges of that Peo|ple.

<P>BUT we are to ob&s;erve, that the Foundation of all their Wickedne&s;s was, their <HI>for&s;aking the holy Covenant.</HI> And this is the Occa&s;ion and Ground of all abominable Practices in a Chri&s;tian Land.

<P>Now the&s;e corrupted Em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;aries of the Tyrant were among the Jews, what the Tories are in this Country in the pre&s;ent Day. They for&s;ook the holy Covenant, and then they were corrupted by Flatteries to give Intelligence to one of the wor&s;t of Men, and cruele&s;t of Tyrants that ever exi&s;ted on this Side the infernal Regions. And how are &s;uch Co|venant-breakers corrupted &s;till by Bribes and Flatteries, to give the Ty|rant and his Cut-throats Intelligence?</P>
<P>WE &s;hall endeavor to take a little larger View of our Subject, under the following Propo&s;itions, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>

<P>IV. MAKE Application.</P>
<P>I. WE are to de&s;cribe, in a comparative View, the Per&s;ons &s;poken of in the Text.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE fir&s;t is a Tyrant, and he one of the greate&s;t and wor&s;t that ever exi&s;ted among tho&s;e that had the Name of Man. Antiochus, it would &s;eem, aimed to be more than a Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander both. He was wor&s;e by far than both of them, for he even abandoned all Religion and Virtue. Not only did he level his Oppo&s;ition again&s;t the Religion of the Jews, the only true Religion then in the World, but even the Religion of Nature, all the Religion of the Gentiles, &s;ee Ver. 36, 37, of the Context. <Q>And the King &s;hall do according to his Will; and he &s;hall exalt him&s;elf, and magnify him&s;elf above every
<PB N="5" REF="017316_0004_103CECA9D27C8F28">
God; and he &s;hall &s;peak marvellous Things again&s;t the God of Gods.&mdash;Neither &s;hall he regard the God of his Fathers, nor the De&s;ire of Women, nor regard any God; for he &s;hall magnify him&s;elf above all.</Q> So he was a perfect and con&s;ummate Athir&s;t. This was un|common. Nebuchadnezzar was a Dei&s;t, and a Wor&s;hipper of Idols. Yea he owned and acknowleged the only true God.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dan.</HI> 3 28, 29. <HI>and</HI> 4. 2, 3, 37.</NOTE> And &s;o did mo&s;t, if not all the old Tyrants. The le&s;s any Man has of Religion, the more he is of a Tyrant. Moreover this Antiochus &s;tripped and plundered a great Part of the World of their natural Rights and Privileges, took away their E&s;tates and Laws, and &s;uch as e&s;caped with their Lives were turned into a State of Poverty and Di&s;tre&s;s. v. 43 <HI>He &s;hall have Power over the Trea&s;ures of Gold and of Silver; and over all the precious Things of Egypt.</HI> And he plundered the Temple and the City of Jeru&s;alem.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Maccabees,</HI> 1 <HI>Chap.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, he u&s;ed Chicanery and Flattery, corrupting and bribing People to favor and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his wicked Practices. Thus this <HI>vile Per&s;on</HI> obtained the Kingdom by Flattery, ver. 21. And he corrupted by Flatteries loo&s;e and wicked People to &s;tand on his Side, and carry on his infernal Works of Rapine and Cruelty. What a lively Picture of later Tyrants. <Q>He &s;cattered among them the Prey and the Spoil and the Riches,</Q> ju&s;t as GEORGE the Third of England has among his corrupt Mini&s;try, and his Va&s;&s;als that he has flattered and cajoled to cut the Throats of this peaceable Country. How has he exhau&s;ted the public Trea&s;ury, and oppre&s;&s;ed his loyal Subjects by mo&s;t enormous Taxes, till they are in a great Mea&s;ure ruined and bankrupt|ed, and the poor peri&s;hing in the Streets, &s;till hardened again&s;t all their Cries, Prayers, Petitions and Remon&s;trances, and perfectly callous to all Feeling of the Mi&s;eries of his People, till the Nation, being thrown into the greate&s;t Ferment, has ri&s;en again&s;t him and his corrupt Parliament.</P>
<P>AGAIN, this impious Antiochus &s;ent Fire and Sword among&s;t his Jewi&s;h Subjects, ver. 33. <Q>Yet they &s;hall fall by the Sword, and by Flame, by Captivity and by Spoil many Days.</Q> This is exactly an&s;wered in his Antitype in England, who for the&s;e five or &s;ix Years has been laying many of our populous Towns in A&s;hes, and pouring out the Blood of hundreds and thou&s;ands of the peaceable Inhabitants by the Force of the Sword.</P>
<P>ONCE more, Antiochus was a great Per&s;ecutor of the Saints of the mo&s;t High. <Q>His Heart was again&s;t the holy Covenant,</Q> ver. 28. And tho&s;e whom he de&s;troyed by the Sword, Fire, Captivity and Spoil&punc; many days, were &s;uch as <HI>had Under&s;tanding, and in&s;tructed many</HI> in the
<PB N="6" REF="017316_0005_103CECAB8D258A20">
Things of God, ver. 33. He de&s;troyed the mighty and the holy Peo|ple, and &s;tood up again&s;t the Prince of Princes.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chap</HI> 8 24 25</NOTE> He changed their Laws, took away their Religion, and placed the Abomination of De&s;o|lation in the holy Place, ver. 31.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See a particular amount of the&s;e things.</HI> I <HI>Mac.</HI> I. 44&mdash;63.</NOTE></P>
<P>SIMILAR to this has the Tyrant of England begun his Per&s;ecutions in this Land, by his notorious Quebec Bill, by which he e&s;tabli&s;hed Po|pery in the extended Province of Canada; and al&s;o by e&s;tabli&s;hing the Popi&s;h Religion in England la&s;t Year by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE other Sort of People &s;poken of in our Text, is the Tyrant's Minions and Va&s;&s;als; his corrupt Party. No Man &s;o vile and wicked but he will have Companions, both in this World and in the World to come.&mdash;Now the&s;e were,</P>
<P N="1">1. SUCH as <HI>for&s;ook the holy Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was the Covenant God made with his People I&s;rael. The Co|venant of Abraham, I&s;aac, and Jacob. It al&s;o included the Sinai Cove|nant, which was founded on the Abrahamic. In this Covenant God promi&s;ed to be their God, and took them to be his People.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 17. 8.<HI>Exod 20. 2 29 45. Deut. 29.</HI> 10,&mdash;13<HI>Deut. 7. 6.</HI></NOTE> Al&s;o in this Covenant, he gave them Statutes, Laws and In&s;titutions for them to walk in. And he commanded them to be &s;eparate from all People in the World, not to &s;ymbolize with them in Religion, Cu&s;toms, and Manners, for they were a holy People to him&s;elf. But the&s;e wicked Per&s;ons could not endure the Strictne&s;s and Severity of the divine Rules that were given them. Their Religion was too pure and holy for their un&s;anctified Hearts; and their blind and carnal Rea&s;on fal&s;ely taught them that there was no Nece&s;&s;ity of it; and therefore, though they had joined in the holy Covenant Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, they &s;oon for&s;ook it. Perhaps not all at once, but by Degrees they grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e, till they wholly abandoned the Profe&s;&s;ion as well as Practice of Religion. And how is this like Multitudes of the pre&s;ent Generation, who have for&s;aken the holy Covenant, and the Purity of Doctrine and Wor&s;hip maintained by their Fathers? And from this have proceeded to more Ungodline&s;s and Licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. THESE People not only for&s;ook, but <HI>did wickedly again&s;t the Co|venant.</HI>&mdash;They broke the Covenant, and walked in direct Oppo&s;ition to the holy Commands and I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ons of it. They profaned the holy Covenant, and gave them&s;elves up to all vicious Pract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">es. And thus many, if not all, who have joined the Tyra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t of England, have gone into loo&s;e Practices. They are generally a lying, di&s;hone&s;t Sett of Creatures,
<PB N="7" REF="017316_0006_103CECAD40AF1C20">
who&punc; to the great Grief of good Men, have formerly been waiting for, and catching at Offices of Profit, P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aces and Pen&s;ions, to gratify their Pride and Avarice, and to &s;upport their Extravagancies; and the lower Sort of them are abandoned to Idlene&s;s, Drunkenne&s;s and Deceit. And how very contrary is Religion and Virtue to &s;uch Children of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">? Thus they have done wickedly again&s;t the Covenant of the Lord God of their Fathers.</P>
<P N="3">3. THESE wicked People were bribed and hired, and &s;o gained to the Tyrant's Intere&s;t <HI>by Corruption.</HI>&mdash;Here we &s;ee where breaking and for&s;aking the holy Covenant will carry Men, even to all Wickedne&s;s: Now they are ready to do any Thing for Money; and are no&s;ed about by Flatteries to commit Murders, and every vile Thing. Thus our Engli&s;h Antiochus has corrupted many of our Covenant-breakers, by Flatteries and a little filthy Lucre, to aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in all his Bar|barities.</P>
<P N="4">4. THESE People were the Tyrant's Spies, that gave him Intelligence. This was one of the mo&s;t con&s;ummate Pieces of their helli&s;h Wickedne&s;s and Hypocri&s;y. The&s;e Covenant-breakers, that lived among the Jews, &s;ecretly informed Antiochus of all that pa&s;&s;ed, &s;o that he knew how every Thing was going on in the Camp of the Maccabees, and the Situ|ation they were in, whereby he was able to do according to his Will in many Re&s;pects. Our Tories, that live among us and in the Country, are not the fir&s;t in &s;uch an infernal Plan, who privately keep up their Corre&s;pondence with the Enemy, and give them Intelligence of every Thing that may be to their Advantage. The old Spirit of Per&s;ecution, and the Spirits of Devils reign in &s;uch People, and <HI>they are of</HI> the ma|lignant Spirit of <HI>their Father the Devil,</HI> &s;ecretly working, watching, and giving Information. For what? To a&s;&s;i&s;t the Nero of England to butcher and de&s;troy peaceable Inhabitants, Men, Women and Children; who has hired his &s;warthy Barbarians to commit their &s;avage Murders on the innocent and defencele&s;s without Di&s;tinction. Witne&s;s Su&s;que|hannah, and the Settlements above Albany.</P>
<P>WICKED Tyrants, to compa&s;s the Rights of Mankind, to de&s;troy the righteous, and put an End to all who oppo&s;ed their ambitious and haughty De&s;igns, have ever had their cajoled and corrupted Minions, whom they have employed in watching and &s;pying out good and hone&s;t People. So Saul had his Creatures to watch David; and Doeg was one of his Informers again&s;t him and the Prie&s;ts of the Lord. The Phari&s;ees watched our Saviour, and had their Spies, the Herodians, to watch and entangle him in his Talk. And how many have there been
<PB N="8" REF="017316_0007_103CECAEDF17ABC8">
&s;ent out by the bloody Nero of England, to watch every Part of our Country and our Army, to give him Intelligence? And, how &s;hocking and &s;urpri&s;ing is it to think that &s;uch Children of the infernal Regions, who&s;e League is with Death and Hell, &s;hould be &s;upported by our own Inhabitants, to bring the Enemy upon the defencele&s;s, to commit their Ravages and Depopulations on the frontier Settlements, without any ju&s;t Provocation! My Soul, come not thou into their Secret: unto their A&s;&s;embly, mine Honor, be not thou united.</P>
<P>WE proceed,</P>
<P>II. To &s;hew the <HI>Heinou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of the Wickedne&s;s of &s;uch People.</P>
<P>AND, I. Breaking and for&s;aking the holy Covenant, is the Sin which &s;tands in the Front of all, as big with the mo&s;t heaven-daring In&s;olence and Contempt of what is &s;acred, and pregnant with every other Enormity.</P>
<P>GOD's Covenant is a holy Covenant: And where the Go&s;pel comes, People have it, in all the rich Grace of it, brought and freely tendered to them. Many think they are not in that Covenant except they are converted, or have made a public and &s;olemn Recognition of it. Such People do but deceive them&s;elves. It is true indeed, that the uncon|verted have not embraced the Mercy and Grace of the Covenant, and &s;o are not intere&s;ted in the internal and &s;pecial Ble&s;&s;ings of it. And &s;uch as have not publicly recognized the Covenant, are not under per&s;onal Bonds of their own, to the Church, to attend the Seals of it. But they are under the Law of the Covenant to their Maker; becau&s;e his Au|thority binds them in the &s;tronge&s;t Manner to be to him a People. The Children of I&s;rael were in the Covenant, though they did not particularly and explicitly recognize it in but few Generations: and God con&s;idered them as his Covenant People. So now, my Brethren, you were born under the Covenant, and have it admini&s;tred to you in a preached Go&s;pel. And you that do not heartily embrace it, do wick|edly again&s;t it in that, and in your &s;lighting the Grace and Mercy of it, and in turning your Backs upon the Seals of it. You do wickedly again&s;t it in all your &s;inful Words and Actions, and in all your Oppo|&s;ition to God and Conformity to this World. And this is what aggra|vates your Sin, that it is again&s;t all the Mercy and Grace of the Cove|nant Had you never known the holy Covenant, your Wickedne&s;s had not been to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> us. And thus our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Saviour &s;ays concerning the Jews, <HI>If I had not come and &s;poken to them they had not bad Sin; but new they have no Cloak for their Sin.</HI>&mdash;<HI>If I had not done among them the Works which none other man did, they had not had Sin.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> 15. 22, 24.</NOTE> To &s;in again&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="017316_0008_103CECB064F862D0">
the Love and Grace of the Redeemer, and all the rich Mercy of God in the new Covenant, is inconceivably heinous. But this our Infidels do, and this all our wicked People do&punc; It is the very Ca&s;e of our Drunk|ards, Swearers and Sabbath-breakers, with our unclean Per&s;ons, and all our unju&s;t and extortionous People. And is it not, in a glaring Light, mo&s;t aggravatedly the Ca&s;e with our Tories? The Tories in the Time of the Maccabees were <HI>the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors</HI> who for&s;ook the holy Covenant, and gave Intelligence to the Tyrant, being corrupted by Flatteries. Our Tories have for&s;aken the Covenant, and given the Antiochus of England &s;ecret Intelligence. They are corrupted with Flatteries, the Flatteries of an arbitrary and blood-thir&s;ty Tyrant, with Flatteries to betray their own Country, the Lives, Liberties and Fortunes of their Neighbours, into the Hands of the hardned Pharaoh of England. And if this is not Wickedne&s;s, then Wickedne&s;s is not to be found in Earth or Hell. Wickedne&s;s is merely ideal, and nothing but a Whim and Chimera of vapoury Brains and dreaming Fools.</P>
<P>BREAKING and for&s;aking the Covenant of the Lord God of their Fathers, was the Sin which ruined I&s;rael of old, by bringing all their fearful Judgments upon them, &s;o as to make them an A&s;toni&s;hment and an H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ing among all the Nations.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> 29. 24, 25.</NOTE> Every Degree of Covenant-break|ing is provoking to God, and will &s;urely bring Wrath temporal as well as eternal without Repentance. How much more when Men go on to this high Degree of Wickedne&s;s, of betraying and &s;elling their Country into the Hands of the Banditti of England, as Judas did his Ma&s;ter into the Hands of Murderers?</P>
<P N="2">2. THE great Wickedne&s;s of Tyrants and their Mercenaries is, that they are guilty of Murder. And their Emi&s;&s;aries are the Cau&s;es of the cruelle&s;t of Murders. The Murders that have been committed in this Country, &s;ince the <HI>Bo&s;ton Ma&s;&s;acre,</HI> are very numerous, and would &s;well into large Volumes, were they to be properly noted; and chiefly, if not altogether owing to the&s;e abandoned Wretches, the Tories, who&s;e inve|terate Malice, and in&s;atiate Avarice has kept them in <HI>perpetual Motion.</HI></P>
<P>MURDER is a crying Sin. Innocent Blood cries, it cries for Venge|ance. The Voice of thy Brother's Blood crieth to me from the Ground; and now thou art cur&s;ed.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> 4. 10, 11.</NOTE> O dreadful Thought!

<P>WE proceed,</P>
<P>III. To &s;hew the Danger of &s;uch Per&s;ons in a State or Country.</P>
<P>AND be&s;ure &s;uch People are &s;ome of the greate&s;t Pe&s;ts to Mankind, though care&s;&s;ed and applauded by the Tyrants.&mdash;For,</P>
<P N="1">1. THEY are a Part of the Community, a Part of it's Numbers and Strength; and therefore they take off &s;o much, and weaken and dimi|ni&s;h it according to their Numbers and Weight.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY are &s;ecret Enemies, often taken for Friends, and many Times a Part of our Councils, frequently Men in Office, that have much Power and Influence, and by being in &s;uch Departments are able to carry on their Corre&s;pondence with the Enemy, to their great Advan|tage. This &s;hows that &s;uch Men are very dangerous, much more &s;o than open Enemies. David &s;ays concerning Ahitophel, <HI>If it had been an Enemy I could have born it, neither was it be that hated me, that did

magnify him&s;elf again&s;t me; then I would have bid my&s;elf from him. But it was thou, a Man, mine Equal, my Guide and mine Acquaintance.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al</HI> 55 12, 13</NOTE> Who would have thought a Man of &s;o much Wi&s;dom as Ahitophel, would have joined in &s;o bad a Cau&s;e as Ab&s;alom's? <HI>The Coun&s;el that he gave in tho&s;e Days, was as if a Man had enquired at the Oracle of God.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 16 23</NOTE> And he was a Profe&s;&s;or of Religion. <HI>We took &s;weet Coun&s;el together,</HI> &s;ays Da|vid, <HI>and walked unto the Hou&s;e of God in Company</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 55 14.</NOTE> And this is fre|quently the Ca&s;e with Tories, that they are Men of Sen&s;e, reputed for Wi&s;dom, and &s;ome of them for Religion; but they have broken the Covenant, and employ their Wi&s;dom to build up and &s;upport an unju&s;t and wicked Cau&s;e, the Cau&s;e of Tyranny.</P>
<P N="3">3. TORIES are an internal Enemy, a Pe&s;t and Plague in our own Bowels. It has often, of old, been ob&s;erved, that the Enemy within the Walls was the mo&s;t dangerous. The&s;e are like a Di&s;ea&s;e at the Heart, and in the Vitals, and what can be more dangerous?</P>
<P>HAD it not been for the&s;e corrupted Creatures, the Tools of the Ty|rant, we may rea&s;onably think the bloody Conte&s;t in America had been ended Years before this, to it's la&s;ting Glory: But how long it will be before this vital Di&s;ea&s;e be healed, none on this Side Heaven can tell. Our Danger lies in having the&s;e Vipers in our Bo&s;oms. And they are ince&s;&s;ant and indefatigable, and yet, alas, le&s;s Care than ever taken to detect them, and bring them to cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gn Puni&s;hment!</P>
<P N="4">4. THESE wicked Men are Eyes to the Enemy, who would grope in the Dark, were it not for Intelligence obtained by them. The Enemy would not know how to plan their Operations, and to &s;trike to Advan|tage, were it not for &s;uch Juda&s;es. Indeed they are &s;o dangerous we can &s;carce conceive how dangerous they be.&mdash;The Butt of their Envy is at the Pillars of the Country, and it's able&s;t Friends in every Town; the&s;e are marked in their Coun&s;els for De&s;truction. And whenever the&s;e Traitors have guided the Enemy to any Part, they led them to the Hou&s;es of tho&s;e Men they mo&s;t of all envied and to public Stores.</P>
<P>AT other Times they are a&s;&s;iduous in their Endeavors to corrupt their Neighbours; to &s;tir up and carry on Divi&s;ions in Towns and So|cieties; and to &s;pread fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e Reports, together with every other Mi&s;chief the old Serpent is capable of in&s;tigating them to. Surely we need wi&s;e and faithful Watchmen to be Day and Night on our civil Walls.</P>
<P>WE now proceed,</P>
<P>IV. To make APPLICATION.&mdash;And,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE learn that a Tyrant and a Traitor is abandoned of God, a
<PB N="13" REF="017316_0012_103CECB6F7885EA0">
Friend of Hell, a Companion of Sata<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and an Enemy to the human Species. Satan the Chief, the old Tyrant and fir&s;t Traitor, and the&s;e his Seconds.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE &s;ee the dreadful, the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Work Sin has made in this World: a fallen World of Mankind have their Hearts filled with the Seeds of every Evil. 'Tis this that has filled the Earth with Violence, Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion; Wars, Rapine and Plunder. This has &s;et Man again&s;t Heaven, and Men one again&s;t another, &s;o that in &s;ome Sen&s;e every Man's Sword is again&s;t his Fellow.</P>
<P>SIN made Tyrants; and a Tyrant's Heart is full of the Devil, brim full of Hell. Sin is an evil Habit, an evil and envious Temper. St. Paul gives a &s;ad Account of the State of Nature and Sin, <HI>For we,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>were &s;ometimes fooli&s;h, di&s;obedient, deceived, &s;erving diver&s;e Lu&s;ts and Plea&s;ures, living in Malice and Envy, hateful and hating one another.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tit.</HI> 3. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. WE may &s;ee the Danger of breaking Covenant and for&s;aking Re|ligion. All Men have broken the fir&s;t Covenant by the Fall; but God has graciou&s;ly been plea&s;ed to make a &s;econd Covenant, and has ap|pointed a perfect Head and Mediator of it, Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous. This Covenant is propo&s;ed and offered to &s;inful Man in the Go&s;pel; and tho&s;e that for&s;ake it, and break over the Bonds of it, are mo&s;t ju&s;tly le&s;t of God to turn Traitors and Tyrants. Covenant-breakers are Trai|tors to God. They betray his Intere&s;t, Honor and Glory; and &s;et up again&s;t him to &s;upport the Devil's Kingdom, which is made up of Ty|ranny. And the Devil is not only a Tyrant &s;eeking the De&s;truction of tho&s;e that are in Oppo&s;ition to him, as all good People are, but al&s;o to his own Subjects, who are his Slaves and Va&s;&s;als, that he binds in his Iron Chains, and drags along to cruel De&s;truction.</P>
<P>BUT now how &s;urpri&s;ing is it to behold People that are called Chri&s;ti|ans, having been brought up under God's gracious Covenant, turn Tyrants and Traitors?&mdash;And how many Covenant-breakers are there who have not been le&s;t to turn Traitors again&s;t their Country, yet are pulling down the Judgments of God upon the Land?&mdash;God is very jealous for his holy Covenant, and has a tender regard for his own Glory, the Religion he has in&s;tituted and &s;et up in the World. <HI>And his Power and Wrath is again&s;t all them that for&s;ake him.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezra</HI> 8. 22.</NOTE> What brought all the Judgments of God upon I&s;rael, but their for&s;aking his Covenant? And when once they had done this, they threw down God's Altars, killed his Prophets, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a fal&s;e Religion. Now although we have not killed the Amba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;t with the Sword, yet many have for&s;aken them, and for&s;aken Prayer in their Hou&s;es, and public Wor&s;hip,
<PB N="14" REF="017316_0013_103CECB8D0F38DC8">
denied the Bapti&s;m of their Children, turned their Backs on the Lord's Table, denied the Chri&s;tian Sabbath, the Lawfulne&s;s of a defen&s;ive War, the Re&s;urrection of the Body, and the Day of Judgment. Some deny that there &s;hould be any civil Government, and maintain that there &s;hould not be any Magi&s;trate or civil Law, and that no Murderer &s;hould be put to Death, and that every Man &s;hould do that which is right in his own Eyes. And &s;ome a&s;&s;ert that they are perfect, and &s;hall never die. And others that all Men every where and in all Ages &s;hall be &s;aved, that there is no Hell, or future State of Puni&s;hment for wicked Men, together with many other mon&s;trous and ab&s;urd Notions and Opinions. Now all the&s;e in the fir&s;t Place for&s;ook the holy Covenant, and this opened the Door to every wild Imagination and Di&s;order. And how can we &s;uppo&s;e any other but that great is the Wrath of the Lord again&s;t this Land? Who fears? and who&s;e Heart trembles for the Ask of God?</P>
<P N="4">4. WE learn the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Churches &s;trictly adhering to the holy Covenant; and for every Per&s;on to con&s;ider the infinite Importance of the Covenant. This is a &s;olemn Bond to God and one another, to maintain the Religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and perform every civil and &s;ocial Duty. Take away this Bond and Obligation to our Maker, and we are at loo&s;e Ends, and lie open to every Flatterer, to all Corruption and Iniquity; Corruption and Bribery from Tyrants, and from Satan; to be beguiled by his Wiles, and drawn away to e&s;pou&s;e his cur&s;ed Cau&s;e. And what will be the I&s;&s;ue? What, but the Ruin of Religion, the Ruin of our Country, yes, and the eternal Ruin of our own precious Souls?</P>
<P>If Men are not &s;en&s;ible of Bonds to their Maker, they will not long be &s;en&s;ible of any to their fellow Creatures. All Bonds to one another are derived from our Bonds to our Creator. Leave all Covenant out with God, and all we have with Man &s;oon comes to nothing. There|fore, &s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;idering the Covenant in every view of it, and in all it's Exten&s;ivene&s;s and Glory, both as a Covenant of Grace, pro|viding, giving and promi&s;ing all Grace to &s;inful Men, and as a divine Con&s;titution giving Law and laying Obligations on the rea&s;onable Crea|ture, to perform all Duty to God and one another</P>
<P N="5">5. WE learn the Danger of the Love of this World. <HI>The Love of Money is the Root of all Evil.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 6, 10.</NOTE> The Love of the World, and the Love of Money is the rare Thing. <HI>If any Man love the World, the Love of the Father is not in him.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1. <HI>John</HI> 3. 15.</NOTE> Some Man for the Love of Money of Honor, will Tell their Country to a Tyrant; and the Love of Money and Ho|nor makes many a Tyrant.

It has been &s;toried of &s;ome Men, that they have made a League with the Devil, and &s;old their Souls to him for Money. The Story is too true with Re&s;pect to Worldlings; they virtually &s;ell their Souls, Chri&s;t and Heaven for the Things of this vain World, betray their Country and neare&s;t Friends to a Tyrant, for the empty Vanities of a Moment's <HI>Auri &s;acra fames,</HI> &s;aid the Heathen Poet, <HI>Cur&s;ed Love of Money.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6.

<P N="7">7. How excellent the Love of our Country and it's deare&s;t and &s;acred Intere&s;ts?

<P>SINCE the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e, were &s;ent to the pre&s;s, &s;ome things remarkable have occurred, that, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, may awaken and alarm the country. Particularly the late infernal plot of the infamous <HI>Arnold</HI> for delivering up our truly worthy General, and the Army and important works at We&s;t Point, into the hands of the enemy; whereby they might &s;oon open a pa&s;&s;age from New-York to Albany, and thence to Canada. Here was trea&s;on, cur&s;ed trea&s;on, and wickedne&s;s that wants a name, perhaps in hell as well as earth. And altho' heaven has, in a very won|derful way, di&s;covered and broke the &s;nare, ble&s;&s;ed be God forever and ever, yet all the mi&s;chievous de&s;igns connected with the horrid plan are not ended. The late extraordinary movements and exertions of the Northern enemy. The taking, as we hear, of Fort-Ann, Fort William Henry, or Fort George and Fort Edward, burn|ing and plundering the towns and &s;ettlements in tho&s;e parts, and on Mohawk river, and killing and captivating the poor inhabitants, together with the de&s;olations com|mitted at Royalton, were mo&s;t probably concerted in the afore&s;aid infernal plot. Surely we cannot now he&s;itate a moment longer, whether it be not ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to awake and look about our&s;elves, in good earne&s;t. We are, e&s;pecially on the&s;e long extended frontiers, and through the <HI>Grants,</HI> in jeopardy every hour. Every thing we hold dear and &s;acred, is eminently expo&s;ed to the ravages of a Ty|rant's me cenaries and &s;avage cut throats! The dagger is at our brea&s;ts, and the tomahawk over our heads! And the &s;ituation of our whole country and our army is truly alarming.&mdash;My dear countrymen, what think you of the&s;e things?&mdash;Shall we after the mo&s;t glorious &s;truggle for our liberties and our all, that ever the world behold, &s;ink down in a fatal lethargy, let the enemy take ALL, and en&s;lave me and our children forever? Why &s;hould any call his hou&s;es lands, money or pro|vi&s;ions his own, at &s;uch a time as this? Is it not high time that every one &s;hould be ready to part with all, except for nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, for the &s;upport of his country's cau&s;e?
