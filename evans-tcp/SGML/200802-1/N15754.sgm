<HEAD>TO THE STUDENTS OF NATURE, IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF one of the mo&s;t celebrated Profe&s;&s;ors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CULLEN in his preface.</NOTE> of the age had rea&s;on to &s;ay, that to deliver a &s;y&s;tem of the doctrines and rules proper for directing the practice of Phy&s;ic, was an undertaking attended with &s;uch great difficulty, that after an experience of <HI>forty years,</HI> as well as much reading and re|flection, it was with great diffidence he entered upon &s;uch a work.&mdash;With how much more dif|fidence ought one to appear who cannot boa&s;t of either?</P>
<P>I always intended to pre&s;ent my hearers with a <HI>Synop&s;is</HI> of my <HI>Cour&s;e</HI> of <HI>Lectures,</HI> when years and more experience &s;hould give me &s;ufficient confi|dence; but &s;everal circum&s;tances concurring at this time, induce me to offer you the FIRST PART of my de&s;ign, crude and imperfect as it is.</P>
<P>Prejudices have operated again&s;t our Medical In&s;titution in general; and although the preli|minary
<PB N="iv" REF="020123_0003_0FADED6E2F70BEB0">
or auxilliary branches, <HI>Anatomy, Botany, Chymi&s;try</HI> and <HI>Natural Philo&s;ophy,</HI> are allowed to be not altogether u&s;ele&s;s or void of entertain|ment, yet the THEORY AND PRACTICE OF PHY|SIC, which comprehends and connects them all, is repre&s;ented as neither u&s;eful nor entertaining, and if nece&s;&s;ary, ea&s;ier collected from books than lectures. Although every thing in nature hath a reference to the <HI>human per&s;on,</HI> yet the Phy&s;ician may ob&s;erve that &s;ome things here treated of, or rather the view in which they are exhibited, can hardly be called medical.&mdash;This will be &s;ufficiently explained when it is known that hitherto far the greate&s;t part of my hearers mean not to pur&s;ue phy&s;ic as a profe&s;&s;ion; but, in imitation of &s;e|veral illu&s;trious characters, wi&s;h only to fill up their liberal lei&s;ure in that mo&s;t u&s;eful of all &s;tudies, the knowledge of them&s;elves. It hath been la|mented that tho&s;e who have &s;tudied the philo&s;o|phy of the human mind, have been little ac|quainted with the &s;tructure of the human body and the laws of the animal oeconomy; notwith|&s;tanding the mind and the body are &s;o intimately connected, and have &s;uch a mutual influence on one another, that the con&s;titution of either, exa|mined <HI>a part,</HI> can never be thoroughly under|&s;tood.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Gregory.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="020123_0004_0FADED6E9C72C2B8">In con&s;ideration of your various pur&s;uits, we have gone one &s;tep further, and encouraged you to &s;tudy man in relation to other animals and things; and glancing at the wondrous <HI>chain</HI> of univer&s;al exi&s;tence, have called your attention to &s;ome of its links; and this in order that you might view this "goodly frame" in the light of a large and well regulated family, all &s;ub&s;ervient to each other in proper <HI>&s;ubordination,</HI>&mdash;all contri|buting in their proper places to the perfection and happine&s;s of the whole. In contemplating the <HI>principle of animation</HI> through the innumera|ble &s;pecies of bea&s;ts, birds, fi&s;hes and in&s;ects, 'till we reached the vegetable, we have been led on to enquire, whether the&s;e two tribes of orga|nized beings do not form (in&s;tead of two di&s;tinct kingdoms) one <HI>immen&s;e family</HI>?</P>
<P>Thus, without neglecting the doctrine of di&s;|ea&s;es, and their remedies, have we endeavoured to give you a more plea&s;ing picture of man and his relations, than what mere medical lectures afford; and I was glad of &s;uch an opportu|nity to combat certain prejudices: for when I reflected how all the &s;ciences commonly taught in Univer&s;ities were linked together, I felt a repugnance to the idea of phy&s;ic being <HI>in&s;ulated,</HI> and wi&s;hed to &s;ugge&s;t to you that
<PB N="vi" REF="020123_0005_0FADED6F58DF2830">
the art of medicine, when properly pur&s;ued, ac|tually comprehended more of the &s;ciences than any other branch of knowledge you could name,&mdash;that man, placed at the head of the vi&s;ible &s;eries, was an <HI>Epitome</HI> or compendium of the great world, and included within him&s;elf all the powers and properties of nature, <HI>vegetable, mineral, animal</HI> and <HI>intellectual,</HI>&mdash;that &s;uch a know|ledge of him was &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the human race, that without it the great <HI>Linnaeus</HI> &s;eems to doubt whether any other characters be &s;ufficient to en|title one to be ranked among mankind; for &s;ays he, "<HI>Haec &s;i noveris</HI> HOMO <HI>es, et a reliquis anima|libus di&s;tincti&s;&s;imum genus.</HI>"</P>
<P>Natural Hi&s;tory is not introduced here barely to amu&s;e, but with a hope that by cultivating a ta&s;te for the works of nature &s;ome &s;olid advantages may ari&s;e. The American may po&s;&s;ibly be re|minded, in his re&s;earches, that while factitious wealth is dug up from the bowels of the earth, <HI>our</HI> only true and &s;olid riches mu&s;t be drawn from its <HI>upper &s;tratum,</HI> from thence man receives a re|ward of his hone&s;t indu&s;try by a kind of perpe|tual miracle wrought in his favour.</P>
<P>Should we not, moreover, encourage the na|tural curio&s;ity of our countrymen to read that <HI>&s;acred &s;cripture</HI> written by the finger of the DEITY

him&s;elf, upon every <HI>animal,</HI> every <HI>plant,</HI> and every <HI>mineral</HI>? An uncorrupted &s;cripture this! A kind of &s;econd revelation! The GREAT BOOK OF NATURE, which comprehends the objects of every &s;cience, is peculiarly inviting in this coun|try; its ample pages &s;trike all who have eyes to &s;ee and hearts to feel!</P>
<P>SOME have &s;aid, the&s;e &s;ubjects, though curious, are foreign to the medical profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;but they are mi&s;taken. Where did HIPPOCRATES, and other Princes of the art, &s;tudy? Wherever there were men, and the concomitants of humanity, di&s;ea&s;e and death,&mdash;AIR, EARTH and WATER,&mdash; all that &s;urrounded them were the pages they &s;tudied.</P>
<P>The utility of a SYNOPSIS need not be dwelt on. Method is the &s;oul of &s;cience; by it a con|fu&s;ed heap of facts may be &s;o ranged and di&s;po&s;ed, that the judgment may act with freedom, and perform its office with advantage.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See preface to <HI>Novum Organ,</HI></NOTE> After the &s;ubject of an enquiry is fixed on, and well de|fined, it &s;hould be divided into particular heads of enquiry: then the order of the things them|&s;elves are to be ranged and dige&s;ted into the form of regular tables, &s;o that the mind may act upon them in ju&s;t order and with regularity; <HI>the whole to be &s;o con&s;tructed as to admit of being tran&s;po&s;ed, added to, or corrected.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See preface to <HI>Novum Organ,</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="020123_0007_0FADED711E138238">The SYNOPSIS is divided into <HI>four parts.</HI> The FIRST PART is in your hands.</P>
<P>Although mo&s;t of the &s;ubjects here mentioned have been treated of by men of eminence, the Phy&s;ician will however &s;ee that we have taken a different view of the &s;ame &s;ubject from what is found in authors, and as far as I know among lecturers. Whole aphori&s;ms are in&s;erted upon &s;ome &s;ubjects, where we knew of no book that could &s;erve as a guide to the pupil. The apho|ri&s;ms on the <HI>Vis vitalis</HI> may &s;erve as an example. The ob&s;curity in which the proce&s;s of <HI>dige&s;tion</HI> was involved till very lately, will &s;erve to explain the length of that &s;ection; the &s;ame may be &s;aid of the <HI>Lymphatic &s;y&s;tem,</HI> while the well e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrine of the <HI>circulation</HI> will explain the brevity of that &s;ubject. Under this head, &s;ome entire &s;entences are taken from <HI>Fordyce</HI> and <HI>Haller</HI> to comment on, and wherever we have taken the &s;ame liberty with any author, it is mentioned in the margin in general, and in the lectures in par|ticular.</P>
<P>The SECOND PART treats of the more obvious cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es,&mdash;the atmo&s;phere&mdash;the &s;itua|tion&mdash;the diet&mdash;and then of particular ACUTE DISEASES; which will be treated of according to the plan fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted by SYDENHAM, namely, arranged like the &s;ubjects of natural hi&s;tory into

<HI>cla&s;&s;es, orders, genera</HI> and <HI>&s;pecies.</HI> By &s;uch an a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance the &s;tudent of nature is led as it were by an <HI>Ariadne's clue,</HI> through the turnings and laby|rinths of the <HI>three kingdoms</HI> of nature, and with|out a &s;imilar one, the &s;tudent of medicine could &s;carcely retain the de&s;cription of di&s;ea&s;es, or re|member how they are treated.</P>
<P>The THIRD PART treats of CHRONIC DISEASES, beginning with the mo&s;t &s;imple, and ending with the mo&s;t complicated.</P>
<P>The FOURTH PART con&s;iders the OPERATION OF MEDICINES, and treats of the METHODUS CON|CINNANDI FORMULAS MEDICAMENTORUM.</P>
<P>In the execution of our plan, we wi&s;h not to hold up what we have to offer to you as our own &s;elf-created knowledge, but rather what we have collected from the writings of approved authors, from lectures, and from the communications of eminent men.

<P>THE intentions of our forefathers in found|ing this College. The idea the Romans had of <HI>education</HI> evident from the origin of that word. The difference in the minds of men, not &s;o much the effect of organization as education. The aptitude to under&s;tanding is a dead power in man, when not vivified by pa&s;&s;ions. The pa&s;|&s;ion of <HI>glory,</HI> the commonly exciting cau&s;e. All men are &s;u&s;ceptible of it in countries where glory conducts to power.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Helvetius.</NOTE> Reflections on the progre&s;s of civilization from the naked &s;avage to poli&s;hed humanity.

<P>An account of &s;ome of the Grecian Philo&s;o|phers and Phy&s;icians who flouri&s;hed during the period of Grecian liberty. <HI>Marcus Cato's</HI> opinion of them in his day.</P>

<P>A &s;hort hi&s;tory of the various &s;ects that flou|ri&s;hed from this period to the time the <HI>We&s;tern Empire</HI> was overran by the Goths, and the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> by the Arabs.</P>

<P>MEDICINE, long cultivated on the coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar,</HI> derives its origin according to them, from the &s;upreme God, and handed down for myriads of ages through the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive orders of inferior Deities;&mdash;reflections thereon,&mdash;a &s;peci|men of their theory.

<P>The more we know of any &s;cience, the greater number of <HI>particulars</HI> are we able to re&s;olve into <HI>general ones,</HI> and con&s;equently we &s;hall be able to reduce its principles within narrower bounds.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prie&s;tley.</NOTE> This opinion verified by the pre&s;ent &s;tate of me|dicine.</P>

Certain extremities of the nerves (&sect; II.) &s;o framed as to be capable of a peculiar contractility; and in con&s;equence of their &s;ituation and attach|ments, to be by their contraction capable of mov|ing mo&s;t of the &s;olid and fluid parts of the body. The&s;e are named <HI>moving</HI> or <HI>mu&s;cular fibres.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That mu&s;cular fibres are a continuation of the medul|lary &s;ub&s;tance of the brain and nerves, has not been &s;hewn by Anatomi&s;ts, nor univer&s;ally admitted by Phy|&s;iologi&s;ts; but we now &s;uppo&s;e it, and hope afterwards to render it &s;ufficiently probable.</HI></P>
<P>Are the <HI>Ganglions</HI> of the nerves to be con&s;idered as a part of the nervous &s;y&s;tem di&s;tingui&s;hed by a peculiar function?</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;everal parts of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, are every where the &s;ame continous medullary &s;ub|&s;tance, which we &s;uppo&s;e to be the vital &s;olids, &s;o con&s;tituted in living animals, and in living &s;y&s;|tems only, as to admit of motions being readily propagated from one part to every other part of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, &s;o long as the continuity and living &s;tate of the medullary &s;ub&s;tance remains.</P>
<P>In the living man there is an immaterial think|ing &s;ub&s;tance or MIND; and every phoenomenon of thinking is to be con&s;idered as an affection or faculty of the mind alone. But this immaterial

and thinking part of man, is &s;o connected with the material and corporeal part of him, and particu|larly with the nervous &s;y&s;tem, that motions ex|cited in this, give occa&s;ion to thought; and thought, however occa&s;ioned, gives ri&s;e to new motions in the nervous &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>It is probable that the motions excited by the application of &s;timuli to a moving and irritable part, or to the nerve going to a moving part, <HI>do not ari&s;e in the brain,</HI> but immediately in the nerves, or in the part; the brain, in this ca&s;e, only keeping up the life of the part, and render|ing it capable of motion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fordyce.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A &s;ub&s;tance may act on one part as a &s;timulant or &s;edative, and have a le&s;s effect, or none at all, when applied to another, although otherwi&s;e equally irritable. Such &s;timuli are called <HI>&s;pe|cific</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See part fourth, <HI>on the action of Medicine.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>(See the aphori&s;ms on the Vis Vitalis.)</HI></P>
<P>It has been conjectured by &s;ome, that motion was communicated to parts by a fluid flowing through the nerves as tubes; by others, that it was communicated by vibrations<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See Hartley, on Man.</NOTE>, and by others, that it ari&s;es from <HI>electricity.</HI></P>
<P>Is a nerve a better conductor of electricity than any other part in the &s;ame &s;tate of moi&s;ture?
