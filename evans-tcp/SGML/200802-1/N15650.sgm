<P>THE following directions were drawn up at the re|que&s;t of the Proprietor of the Mineral Spring and Bath, at Harrogate, who&s;e laudable di&s;po&s;ition to pro|mote the health of his fellow-citizens, at the ri&s;k of his property, merits the encouragement of every friend of hu|manity. Tho&s;e directions, which relate to the u&s;e of the mineral water, are extracted chiefly from an e&s;&s;ay read be|fore the Philo&s;ophical Society in the year 1773, by the au|thor, on the mineral waters of Philadelphia, Abington and Bri&s;tol, and afterwards publi&s;hed in a pamphlet. The analy&s;is of the water at Harrogate will be laid in due time before the Society. It will be &s;ufficient for the pati|ents, who u&s;e it for the pre&s;ent, to know that it is very light, and that it contains a &s;mall quantity of iron, with a large quantity of air, which has lately received the name of hepatic air, and from which its offen&s;ive &s;mell and ta&s;te are derived.</P>
<P>The directions for the u&s;e of the Cold Bath will derive their principal merit from their according with the opini|ons and advice of the mo&s;t approved writers upon that &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD>DIRECTIONS FOR THE USE OF THE <HI>MINERAL WATER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE different &s;tages of &s;ociety, like the different ages of the human body, have their peculiar di&s;ea&s;es.&mdash; In the infancy of all &s;ocieties di&s;ea&s;es are &s;imple and few in number, but in proportion as they advance in arts and opulence, which always bring along with them the refine|ments of luxury, di&s;ea&s;es multiply, and are complicated in &s;uch a manner, as to require more powerful aids than the &s;imple preparations of plants and metals. The&s;e aids have been &s;ought for from a variety of &s;ources, but from none oftener than mineral waters. The&s;e waters, which have flowed for many years unnoticed by our ance&s;tors, have of late attracted the attention of the public, and have now become a very important part of the Materia Medica.</P>
<P>The mineral water, which is to be the &s;ubject of the following directions, when taken into the body, is gently &s;timulating and tonic, promotes the urinary &s;ecretion, and per&s;piration, and &s;ometimes gently opens the bowels.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>OF THE DISEASES IN WHICH THIS MINE|RAL WATER IS PROPER.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THIS water is proper in the HYSTERIA.&mdash;This di&s;|order &s;hews it&s;elf in a variety of &s;hapes. It is known by attacking the female more than the male &s;ex; e&s;pecially &s;uch as are of a delicate habit, by being accompanied with flatulencies, contractions of the mu&s;cles of the belly, and a &s;en&s;e of &s;omething re&s;embling a ball ri&s;ing in the throat.&mdash;It prevails mo&s;t in warm climates and &s;ea&s;ons; and la&s;tly, it is always &s;ubject to exacerbations from any cau&s;e that &s;uddenly affects and di&s;turbs the mind.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is proper in the PALSY, whether of part or of the whole of the body, when the pul&s;e is not
<PB REF="019971_0004_0FAD4977512CBA80">
full, and when the &s;ymptoms of a plethora are wanting; it is always a &s;trong pre&s;umption of the propriety of u&s;ing the&s;e waters, where the di&s;ea&s;e has continued a long time, without any remarkable change in the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the EPILEPSY, when it ari&s;es from an affection of the &s;tomach, or the womb, or from a general weak habit of body, this water is proper.</P>
<P N="4">4. It may be drank with advantage in a certain &s;tage of the GOUT, particularly when it comes on in the decline of life.&mdash;The con&s;titution then exhibits various marks of great debility; the gouty affection in con&s;equence of this, in&s;tead of appearing in the feet, &s;hews it&s;elf in a weakne&s;s, nau&s;ea and acidity of the &s;tomach. The&s;e &s;ymptoms are generally accompanied with co&s;tivene&s;s and flatulency of the bowels.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is u&s;eful in an old ob&s;tinate Diarrhoea or an ha|bitual purgings, when not accompanied with a griping or a di&s;charge of blood mixed with the &s;tools. Sailors returning from long voyages, or from warm climates, are mo&s;t &s;ubject to this di&s;order.</P>
<P N="6">6. It affords the mo&s;t certain relief in all ca&s;es of a WANT OF APPETITE, when it originates from a defect in the &s;tomach. The appetite may be di&s;troyed by cau&s;es which operate directly or indirectly upon the &s;tomach. Tho&s;e which operate directly are tea, &s;pirituous liquors, and bitters taken in an immoderate quantity, or at impro|per times, too full meals, &s;trong vomits, and warm drinks of all kinds; the cau&s;es which operate indirectly on the &s;tomach are all &s;edative pa&s;&s;ions of the mind, &s;uch as, grief, fear, love, &amp;c. together with whatever weakens or di&s;or|ders the other parts of the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>We &s;hall hereafter point out what kind of diet &s;hould be joined with the mineral water, in this di&s;order.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is proper in all tho&s;e COLICS, which ari&s;e from mere weakne&s;s of the bowels, and particularly in that &s;pe|cies, which is accompanied with an overflowing of the bile, a di&s;ea&s;e this to which the inhabitants of warm climates are mo&s;t &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="8">8. Be&s;ides the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, in which the nervous &s;y&s;tem is chiefly affected, this mineral water is u&s;eful in all OB|STRUCTIONS OF THE LIVER AND SPLEEN, whether they are brought on by indolence, intemperance, or intermit|ting fevers, and whether they &s;hew them&s;elves in a mere
<PB REF="019971_0005_0FAD49780A784470">
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">elling and hardne&s;s, or a jaundice, a cough or a drop&s;y. If the drop&s;y it &s;hould be given only while it continues to operate by urine or &s;tool; for this purpo&s;e it &s;hould be drank not in the u&s;ual manner, but in large quantities.</P>
<P N="9">9. It is proper in all ca&s;es of CHRONIC RHEUMATISM. It will be more efficacious in this di&s;order if the fle&s;h bru&s;h be u&s;ed at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P N="10">10. It is very u&s;eful in the PILES, e&s;pecially when they occur in that &s;tage of life in which the artereal plethora yield to the venous. This &s;eldom happens till the thirty-fifth or thirty-&s;ixth year of life,</P>
<P N="11">11. In all FEMALE OBSTRUCTIONS and weakne&s;&s;es, which are accompanied with general languor and debility of the whole &s;y&s;tem, this water affords con&s;iderable relief.</P>
<P N="12">12. It may be given with advantage to children afflicted with WORMS. Here it acts like bark, rhubarb, aloes and bitters of all kinds <HI>indirectly</HI> upon the worms, by giving a proper tone to the bowels. Among the many &s;ub&s;tances which de&s;troy them <HI>directly,</HI> there are few more powerful than sugar, honey, &s;alt and ripe &s;ummer-fruits; all children &s;hew a fondne&s;s for the&s;e things. The appe|tite in this early period of life is not corrupted by habit or vitiated by di&s;ea&s;e, and may therefore be li&s;tened to as the voice of nature. The&s;e &s;ub&s;tances &s;hould be given upon an empty &s;tomach, and the patient &s;hould not eat any thing for an hour afterwards.</P>
<P N="13">13. It is proper in all CUTANEOUS DISEASES and foul ulcers of long &s;tanding, whether they be of &s;corbutic or &s;crophulous nature.&mdash;The part affected &s;hould be wa&s;hed with the mineral water twice a-day.</P>
<P N="14">14. It is u&s;eful in di&s;ea&s;es of the KIDNEYS and BLAD|DER, when a difficulty or ob&s;truction in making water ari&s;es from relaxation or &s;mall calculi in the&s;e organs.</P>
<P N="15">15. It has been u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s in ob&s;tinate GLEETS, after the mo&s;t powerful a&s;tringent medicines have been u&s;ed to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Let us next enquire in WHAT DISEASES THIS WATER IS HURTFUL.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the HYPOCHONDRIAC DISORDER it is an improper remedy.&mdash;Although this di&s;order is &s;ometimes joined with
<PB REF="019971_0006_0FAD4978CAF13948">
Hy&s;teria, yet it is di&s;tinct from it in its nature, and re|quires a very different treatment.&mdash;It is known by its at|tacking the male more than the female &s;ex, by its pre|vailing mo&s;t in cold &s;ea&s;ons and climates, and by its being accompanied with acidity, flatulency, co&s;tivene&s;s or a di|arrhoea, an entire want of, or an inordinate appetite, pain in the &s;tomach and brea&s;t after eating, a vomiting, an un|u&s;ual di&s;charge of &s;pittle from the mouth, colic, &amp;c. In this di&s;order all preparations of iron have been found hurtful. It is a little extraordinary, that a draught of warm water, will &s;ometimes create an appetite in this di&s;order, after bitter and aromatic medicines have been ad|mini&s;tred to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. It has &s;ometimes been recommended in the PHTHE|SIS PULMONALIS or con&s;umption of the lungs.&mdash;But I doubt much whether a chalybeate water ever cured or re|lieved a true con&s;umption, whether brought on by an ab|ce&s;s, tubercles, or ulcers.-In every &s;tate of the human bo|dy, when the inflammatory diathe&s;is prevails, this water is improper&mdash;that it prevails in the con&s;umption we in|fer from the hard pul&s;e and &s;izy appearance of the blood.</P>
<P>This water we &s;aid is improper in all di&s;ea&s;es, when an inflammatory diathe&s;is prevails.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is hurtful therefore in mo&s;t ca&s;es of HEMORRHA|GY, or praeternatural di&s;charges of blood from the body. Hemorrhagies are either active or pa&s;&s;ive: the former hap|pen before, the latter after the thirty-fifth or thirty-&s;ixth year of life. It is in the former in which the inflammatory diathe&s;is chiefly prevails. They are known by an increa&s;e of tone and action of the arterial &s;y&s;tem, and by all the common &s;ymptoms of plethora.</P>
<P N="4">4. This water is likewi&s;e hurtful for the &s;ame rea&s;on in the ACUTE RHEUMATISM and GOUT. This latter di&s;ea&s;e re&s;embles the former a good deal, in its &s;eat, &s;ymp|toms and methods of cure, when it attacks in the early period of life. It appears at the u&s;ual &s;ea&s;ons of inflamma|tory di&s;orders, and is accompanied with a degree of inflam|matory diathe&s;is. It is now called the tonic gout, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from that which comes on in the decline of life, and which, from the irregularity of its &s;eat, times of acce&s;&s;ion, and &s;ymptoms, is called the anomalous or atonic gout.</P>

<PB REF="019971_0007_0FAD49798F27B320">
<HEAD>THE MANNER OF USING THIS WATER</HEAD>
<P>The quantity to be drank daily of this water mu&s;t be determined by the con&s;titution and di&s;ea&s;e of the patient. Too large a draught at fir&s;t has &s;ometimes produced very di&s;agreeable effects, which have di&s;couraged patients from giving it a fair trial. They &s;hould be guarded again&s;t this, and in &s;ome ca&s;es, when the u&s;e of it is clearly indicated, they &s;hould be encouraged to look upon its har&s;h operation at fir&s;t as a pre&s;age of its doing much good. The be&s;t method for people of delicate habits, is to begin with a gill or half a pint and increa&s;e it gradually to five or &s;ix half pints in a day. Formerly the chalybeate water was drank in a much larger quantity, but experience has taught us that three pints or two quarts at mo&s;t in a day is &s;uffi|cient to produce all the &s;alutary effects we have rea&s;on to expect from it.</P>
<P>The patient has always drank too much, if he becomes feveri&s;h and perceives an unea&s;y &s;en&s;e of heat in his brea&s;t, immediately after taking the water.</P>
<P>He &s;hould drink it if po&s;&s;ible at the fountain head, as its virtue is much impaired by being deprived of its air.&mdash;The be&s;t time for drinking it is early in the morning, at noon and in the evening, upon an empty &s;tomach.&mdash;The patient &s;hould always walk or ride, or u&s;e &s;ome gentle exerci&s;e im|mediately after drinking it. When we want to promote per&s;piration, it &s;hould be drank ju&s;t before the patient goes to bed,&mdash;In &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es, which require the&s;e waters, the &s;tomach is oftentimes &s;o weak as to reject them even in the &s;malle&s;t quantity; when this is the ca&s;e, the water &s;hould be mixed with a little cinnamon or mint water, or the &s;to|mach &s;hould be prepared for it by &s;ome grateful aromatic tincture. I have heard of a Lady who could retain a cha|lybeate water on her &s;tomach only when &s;he drank it in bed, and remained there an hour or two afterwards; it re|lieved her of the complaint for which &s;he drank it.</P>
<P>If the water &s;hould not keep the bowels gently open, the patient &s;hould make u&s;e of &s;uch laxative medicines as will be&s;t &s;uit his di&s;order.</P>
<P>It may be drank for &s;everal months in any &s;ea&s;on of the year, e&s;pecially in the &s;pring, &s;ummer and autumn; it is a good practice to intermit it now and then for a few days, le&s;t it &s;hould lo&s;e its efficacy by habit.</P>
<P><PB REF="019971_0008_0FAD497A4EBEBC08">It would encroach too much upon our plan, to mention the particular diet, which the &s;everal di&s;ea&s;es, we have men|tioned, require. The patient &s;hould ob&s;erve the mo&s;t &s;trict regard to the quantity of his food. This caution is the more nece&s;&s;ary, as the water &s;ometimes excites an arti|ficial appetite, which it is by no means &s;afe to gratify fully. Four or five &s;mall, are better than one or two full meals in a day for valetudinarians, upon the account of their being le&s;s &s;timulating.</P>
<P>In all ca&s;es of indige&s;tion, acidity, flatulency, &amp;c. in the &s;tomach, patients &s;hould ab&s;tain from vegetables, and live as much as po&s;&s;ible upon an animal diet. Beef and mutton will be found much ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion in the&s;e ca&s;es than what are commonly called the white meats.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>The younger an animal is, the more it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es of a vegetable nature, and of cour&s;e the le&s;s it is di&s;po&s;ed to corruption. In proportion as it grows old, it loo&s;es its vegetable nature, and tends to alkale&s;cen|cy, and hence it becomes more &s;u&s;ceptible of putre|faction. By the &s;trength of the organs of ma&s;tica|tion, dige&s;tion, &amp;c. in full grown animals, vegeta|ble food is completely animalized.</Q> <BIBL><HI>Madame Darconville's hi&s;tory of putrefaction.</HI></BIBL></P></NOTE></P>
<P>This diet &s;hould not be continued too long. In propor|tion as the &s;tomach recovers its tone, the patient &s;hould gra|dually return to the u&s;e of vegetables or to mixed aliment. What Dr. Cadogan &s;ays of milk, we may &s;ay of vegetables, that it is generally a &s;ign the &s;tomach requires them, when it cannot bear them.</P>
<P>In all cutaneous and &s;corbutic di&s;ea&s;es, foul ulcers, &amp;c. the patient &s;hould live entirly upon vegetables, provided he is not very old or of a weak habit.</P>
<P>There can be no other objection to patients drinking this water with all their meals, than the danger of loo&s;ing their efficacy by too con&s;tant a u&s;e. The ingenious female au|thor of "The hi&s;tory of putrefaction," has proved by ex|periment, that chalybeate waters ha&s;ten the di&s;&s;olution and putrefaction of aliment.</P>
<P>After all that has been &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, we mu&s;t acknowlegde, that mineral waters, like mo&s;t of our medi|cines, are only &s;ub&s;titutes for temperance and excerci&s;e in chronic di&s;ea&s;es. An angel mu&s;t de&s;cend from heaven and
<PB REF="019971_0009_0FAD497B050FAB68">
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">uble this chalybeate pool, before we can expect any ex|traordinary effects from its u&s;e alone. There is a great re&s;emblance between the fate of medicine and religion. In every age and country an article of faith or a mode of wor|&s;hip have u&s;urped the place of the precepts of morality. Thus in medicine we find a variety of remedies &s;uch as mercury, bark, &s;teel, woodlice, tar, lime and mineral wa|ters of all kinds, pine buds, gin&s;eng, &amp;c. have been put in the place of temperance and exerci&s;e. The fa&s;hion of the former pa&s;&s;es away, but the effects of the latter, like the obligations of morality, endure forever.</P>

<HEAD>DIRECTIONS FOR THE USE OF THE <HI>COLD BATH.</HI></HEAD>
<P>It would be an ea&s;y ta&s;k to collect a variety of facts in favor of the antiquity and u&s;efulne&s;s of the Cold Bath, and to &s;hew that it has been recommended by the Phy&s;ici|ans, u&s;ed by the Philo&s;ophers and prai&s;ed by the Poets of every age and country, both as the means of health and plea&s;ure; but this would be foreign to the &s;imple de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent e&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to deliver directions for the u&s;e of the cold bath, I &s;hall take notice in a few words of its u&s;ual effects upon the body, and mention the di&s;ea&s;es, in which it is a proper or a doubtful and improper remedy.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> effect of the cold bath is, to wa&s;h off impu|rities of all kinds from the &s;kin, and thereby to promote a free and equal per&s;piration.</P>
<P N="2">2d. By its pre&s;&s;ure it drives the fluids from the &s;urface to the internal parts of the body. Hence the quick and and &s;ometimes difficult re&s;piration which is generally felt after plunging into cold water.</P>
<P N="3">3d. It braces the animal fibres, and thereby increa&s;es their tone and &s;trength. And</P>
<P N="4">4th. It &s;timulates the whole nervous &s;y&s;tem, and there|by favors the more ea&s;y action of the vital, animal and natural functions of the body.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> advantage of the cold bath, which I &s;hall mention, is that it prevents the di&s;ea&s;es of warm weather. By its tonic action upon the nervous &s;y&s;tem, it dimini&s;hes
<PB REF="019971_0010_0FAD497BD040DF98">
its &s;en&s;ibility to heat, and thereby &s;ecures the con&s;titution from the painful as well as morbid effects of the &s;ummer months. Children therefore (who &s;uffer &s;o generally from warm weather) and per&s;ons &s;ubject to fevers or nervous complaints, &s;hould u&s;e the cold bath, in the Months of June, July and Augu&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2d. In the chronic Rheumati&s;m and atonic Gout the cold bath is a &s;afe and powerful remedy.</P>
<P N="3">3d. In di&s;ea&s;es attended with a relaxation of the nervous &s;y&s;tem, the cold bath promi&s;es relief. Tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es may be reduced to the following heads:
<LIST>
<ITEM>The Epilep&s;y,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Hy&s;teria,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Palpitation of the heart,</ITEM>
<ITEM>A&s;thma,</ITEM>
<ITEM>St. Vitus's dance,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Rickets,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Head-ach,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Palsy of the limbs,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Periodical pains,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Colic,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Diarrhoea,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Cramp,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The whooping Cough,</ITEM>
<ITEM>A defect of &s;eeing or hear|ing from cau&s;es that are not obvious,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Madne&s;s accompanied with debility,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Melancholy or partial in|fanity,</ITEM>
<ITEM>A defect or decay of the intellectual powers not produced by old age, and la&s;tly</ITEM>
<ITEM>The locked Jaw.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The good effects of the cold bath in the la&s;t named di&s;|order have lately been fully a&s;certained by Dr. Wright of the i&s;land of Jamaica.</P>
<P N="4">4th. In tho&s;e ob&s;tructions of the liver and &s;pleen, which follow autumnal fevers, and which are not attended with inflammation, the cold bath may be u&s;ed with advantage.</P>
<P N="5">5th. The exce&s;s and defect of that evacuation which is connected with the health of the female con&s;titution, have both been relieved by the cold bath. It not only cures the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, but frequently removes barrenne&s;s, and pre|vents abortion. Its agreeable effects upon female beauty, would furni&s;h materials for many pages, but the&s;e are fo|reign to the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent e&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P N="6">6th. In eruptions and di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;kin of all kinds, the application of cold water in the form of a bath, has often produced the mo&s;t &s;alutary effects.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now point out tho&s;e con&s;titutions and di&s;ea&s;es in which the u&s;e of the cold bath is doubtful or improper.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. In very old people, and in habits, where the pow|ers of nature have been exhau&s;ted by intemperance, or long and wa&s;ting di&s;ea&s;es, the cold bath is a doubtful remedy.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="11" REF="019971_0011_0FAD497CF88B76C0">2d. In full habits, where from the manner of life, or from the peculiar make of the body, or from previous di&s;ea|&s;es, we have rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect a di&s;po&s;ition to Apoplexy or Pal&s;y, the cold bath &s;hould be u&s;ed with great caution, and never till previous evacuations have been made from the bowels or the blood ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P N="3">3d. In a Plethora of the lungs whether it manife&s;ts it|&s;elf by pain, a difficulty of breathing, or by a &s;pitting of blood, the cold bath is never proper. It has &s;eldom been u&s;ed with advantage or even &s;afety, in con&s;umptive ca&s;es. How far an union of the cold bath with other remedies that determine powerfully to the &s;kin, might prove u&s;eful in the con&s;umption of the lungs, remains to be determined hereafter by bold experiments and accurate ob&s;ervations</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>OF THE TIME AND MANNER OF USING THE COLD BATH.</HEAD>
<P>The be&s;t time for u&s;ing the cold bath, is in the morning before breakfa&s;t. A &s;hort walk, or a moderate degree of exerci&s;e, is &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to prepare the body for the action of the cold water upon it, e&s;pecially in the middle of &s;ummer, when the heat of a clo&s;e room and a feather-bed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Patients, who u&s;e the cold bath, will find its good ef|fects more certain, if they at the &s;ame time &s;leep upon a matra&s;s.</NOTE> the proceeding night, are &s;o apt to in|crea&s;e relaxation, or promote weakning &s;weats. The &s;oo|ner the water is applied to the whole body the better. The head &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the coldne&s;s and pre&s;&s;ure of the water, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible at the &s;ame in&s;tant, with the other parts of the body. The inconveniencies ari&s;ing from wetting the hair, may be obviated by the patients covering his head, before he goes into the bath, with an oiled cloth or bladder cap. From one to three minutes will be long enough in mo&s;t ca&s;es, to remain in the bath.</P>
<P>A patient may always know when he has u&s;ed the bath improperly or &s;taid too long in the water, when he feels a chilline&s;s or pains in his head or brea&s;t, which do not &s;oon yield to the warmth of the air, or to gentle exerci&s;e; on the contrary, it is a promi&s;ing &s;ign of future benefit from the bath, when a patient, upon coming out of the water feels a &s;udden glow of heat diffu&s;e it&s;elf over the whole

body, accompanied with a chearful and animated tone of mind.</P>
<P>The good effects of the bath will be increa&s;ed, by the patients employing a friend or a &s;ervant to rub the body for a quarter or half an hour with a fle&s;h-bru&s;h, or where this cannot be had, with a piece of flannel or coar&s;e linnen cloth, immediately after he comes out of the bath. As &s;oon as he is dre&s;&s;ed he &s;hould devote from half an hour to an hour to gentle exerci&s;e, either by walking or riding on hor&s;e-back, or in a carriage, according to the degrees of his &s;trength, or the nature of his di&s;order.</P>
<P>To <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> health, it will be &s;ufficient to u&s;e the cold bath from once a-day to three times a-week. To <HI>re&s;tore</HI> health in mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es it &s;hould be u&s;ed every day, but in di&s;ea&s;es of an ob&s;tinate nature, or that have been of a long duration, it &s;hould be u&s;ed every morning and evening. It will only be nece&s;&s;ary to add here, that when a patient u&s;es the bath twice in a day, he &s;hould avoid going into it too &s;oon af|ter dining, and &s;hould not u&s;e it &s;o late in the evening, as to prevent his taking the exerci&s;e formerly recommended after it.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider the &s;hower bath as a &s;ub&s;titute for the plunging bath. It was invented only to gratify the weak and indolent. I do not condemn it; on the contrary, I think it may be u&s;ed with advantage in ca&s;es of great weakne&s;s, where the plunging bath is improper. In di&s;ea|&s;es too, where the u&s;e of the plunging bath is of doubt|ful i&s;&s;ue, it &s;hould always be prefered. Perhaps in mo&s;t ca&s;es, where there exi&s;ts a dread of the &s;hock from the weight or coldne&s;s of the water, the mind as well as the body may be prepared to &s;u&s;tain them both, by the u&s;e of the &s;hower bath for a few days.</P>
