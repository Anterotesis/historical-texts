<HEAD>THE ITALIAN, OR, THE Confe&s;&s;ional of the Black Penitents.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the year 1764, &s;ome Engli&s;h travellers in Italy, during one of their excur&s;ions in the envi|rons of Naples, happened to &s;top before the portico of the <HI>Santa Maria del Pianto,</HI> a church belonging to a very ancient convent of the order of the <HI>Black Penitents.</HI> The magnificence of this portico, though impaired by time, excited &s;o much admiration, that the travellers were curious to &s;urvey the &s;tructure to which it belonged, and with this intention they a&s;|cended the marble &s;teps that led to it.</P>
<P>Within the &s;hade of the portico, a per&s;on with fol|ded arms, and eyes directed towards the ground, was pacing behind the pillars the whole extent of the pave|ment, and was apparently &s;o engaged by his own thoughts, as not to ob&s;erve that &s;trangers were ap|proaching. He turned, however, &s;uddenly, as if &s;tar|tled by the &s;ound of &s;teps, and then, without further pau&s;ing, glided to a door that opened into the church, and di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething too extraordinary in the fi|gure of this man, and too &s;ingular in his conduct, to to pa&s;s unnoticed by the vi&s;itors. He was of a tall thin figure, bending forward from the &s;houlders; of a &s;allow complexion, and har&s;h features, and had an
<PB N="iv" REF="032735_0003_0FF4935616DDA728">
eye, which, as it looked up from the cloak that Muf|fled the lower part of his countenance, &s;eemed ex|pre&s;&s;ive of uncommon ferocity.</P>
<P>The travellers on entering the church, looked round for the &s;tranger, who had pa&s;&s;ed thither before them, but he was no where to be &s;een, and, through all the &s;hade of the long ai&s;les, only one other per&s;on appear|ed. This was a friar of the adjoining convent, who &s;ometimes pointed out to &s;trangers the objects in the church, which were mo&s;t worthy of attention, and who now, with this de&s;ign, approached the party that had ju&s;t entered.</P>
<P>The interior of this edifice had nothing of the &s;hewy ornament and general &s;plendor, which di&s;tingui&s;h the churches of Italy, and particularly tho&s;e of Naples; but it exhibited a &s;implicity and grandeur of de&s;ign, con&s;iderably more intere&s;ting to per&s;ons of ta&s;te, and a &s;olemnity of light and &s;hade much more &s;uitable to promote the &s;ublime elevation of devotion.</P>
<P>When the party had viewed the different &s;hrines and whatever had been judged worthy of ob&s;ervation, and were returning through an ob&s;cure ai&s;le towards the portico, they perceived the per&s;on who had ap|peared upon the &s;teps, pa&s;&s;ing towards a confe&s;&s;ional on the left, and, as he entered it, one of the party pointed him out to the friar, and enquired who he was; the friar turning to look after him, did not immedi|ately reply, but on the que&s;tion being repeated, he inclined his head, as in a kind of obei&s;ance, and calm|ly replied, "he is an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in."</P>
<P>"An a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in!" exclaimed one of the Engli&s;hmen; "an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, and at liberty!"</P>
<P>An Italian gentleman, who was of the party, &s;mil|ed at the a&s;toni&s;hment of his friend.</P>
<P>"He has &s;ought &s;anctuary here," replied the fri|ar; "within tho&s;e walls he may not be hurt."</P>
<P>"Do your altars, then, protect the murderer?" &s;aid the Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="032735_0004_0FF46DE6DB833680">
"He could find &s;helter no where el&s;e," an&s;wered the friar meekly.</P>
<P>"This is a&s;toni&s;hing!" &s;aid the Engli&s;hman, "of what avail are your laws, if the mo&s;t atrocious cri|minal may thus find &s;helter from them? But how does he contrive to exi&s;t here! He is, at lea&s;t, in dan|ger of being &s;tarved?"</P>
<P>"Pardon me," replied the friar; "there are al|ways people willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e, who cannot a&s;&s;i&s;t them&s;elves; and as the criminal may not leave the church in &s;earch of food, they bring it to him here."</P>
<P>"Is this po&s;&s;ible?" &s;aid the Engli&s;hman, turn|ing to his Italian friend.</P>
<P>"Why, the poor wretch mu&s;t not &s;tarve," repli|ed the friend; "which he inevitably would do, if food were not brought to him! But have you never &s;ince your arrival in Italy, happened to &s;ee a per&s;on in the &s;ituation of this man? It is by no means an uncommon one.',</P>
<P>"Never!" an&s;wered the Engli&s;hman, "and I can &s;carcely credit what I &s;ee now!"</P>
<P>"Why, my friend," ob&s;erved the Italian, "if we were to &s;hew no mercy to &s;uch unfortunate per&s;ons, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations are &s;o frequent, that our cities would be half depopulated."</P>
<P>In notice of this profound remark, the Engli&s;h|man could only gravely bow.</P>
<P>'But ob&s;erve yonder confe&s;&s;ional,' added the Italian, "that beyond the pillars on the left of the ai&s;le, be|low a painted window. Have you di&s;covered it? The colours of the gla&s;s throw, in&s;tead of light, a &s;hade over that part of the church, which, perhaps, prevents your di&s;tingui&s;hing what I mean!"</P>
<P>The Engli&s;hman looked whither his friend point|ed, and ob&s;erved a confe&s;&s;ional of oak, or &s;ome very dark wood adjoining the wall, and remarked al&s;o, that it was the &s;ame, which the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in had ju&s;t enter|ed.
<PB N="vi" REF="032735_0005_0FF493579E4ED1D0">
It con&s;i&s;ted of three compartments, covered with a black canopy. In the central divi&s;ion was the chair of the confe&s;&s;or, elevated by &s;everal &s;teps above the pavement of the church; and on either hand was a &s;mall clo&s;et, or box, with &s;teps leading up to a grat|ed partition, at which the penitent might kneel, and, concealed from ob&s;ervation, pour into the ear of the confe&s;&s;or, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of crimes that lay heavy on his heart.</P>
<P>"You ob&s;erve it?" &s;aid the Italian.</P>
<P>"I do," replied the Engli&s;hman; "it is the &s;ame which the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in has pa&s;&s;ed into; and I think it one of the mo&s;t gloomy &s;pots I ever beheld; the view of it is enough to &s;trike a criminal with de&s;pair!"</P>
<P>"We, in Italy, are not &s;o apt to de&s;pair," replied the Italian &s;milingly.</P>
<P>"Well, but what of this confe&s;&s;ional?" enquired the Engli&s;hman. "The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in entered it!"</P>
<P>"He has no relation, with what I am about to mention," replied the Italian; "but I wi&s;h you to mark the place, becau&s;e &s;ome very extraordinary cir|cum&s;tances belong to it."</P>
<P>"What are they?" replied the Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P>"It is now &s;everal years &s;ince the confe&s;&s;ion, which is connected with them, was made at that very con|fe&s;&s;ional," added the Italian; "the view of it, and the &s;ight of this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, with your &s;urprize at the liberty which is allowed him, led me to a recollection of the &s;tory. When you return to the hotel, I will com|municate it to you, if you have no plea&s;anter way of engaging your time.</P>
<P>"I have a curio&s;ity to hear it," replied the En|gli&s;hman, "cannot you relate it now?,'</P>
<P>"It is much too long to be related now; that would occupy a week; I have it in writing, and will &s;end you the volume. A young &s;tudent of of Padua, who happened to be at Naples &s;oon after this horri|ble confe&s;&s;ion became public"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="032735_0006_0FF46DEA18D97728">
"Pardon me," interrupted the Engli&s;hman, "that is &s;urely very extraordinary? I thought confe&s;&s;ions were always held &s;acred by the prie&s;t, to whom they were made."</P>
<P>"Your ob&s;ervation is rea&s;onable," rejoined the Italian; "the faith of the prie&s;t is never broken, ex|cept by an e&s;pecial command from an higher power; and the circum&s;tances mu&s;t even then be very ex|traordinary to ju&s;tify &s;uch a departure from the law. But, when you read the narrative, your &s;urpri&s;e on this head will cea&s;e. I was going to tell you that it was written by a &s;tudent at Padua, who, happening to be here &s;oon after the affair became public, was &s;o muck &s;truck with the facts, that, partly, as an exer|ci&s;e, and partly, in return for &s;ome trifling &s;ervices I had rendered him, he committed them to paper for me. You will perceive from the work, that this &s;tudent was very young, as to the arts of compo&s;ition, but the facts are what you require, and from the&s;e he has not deviated. But come let us leave the church."</P>
<P>"After I had taken another view of this &s;olemn edifice," replied the Engli&s;hman, "and particularly of the confe&s;&s;ional you have pointed to my notice!"</P>
<P>While the Engli&s;hman glanced his eye over the high roofs, and along the &s;olemn per&s;pectives of the Santa del Pianto, he perceived the figure of the a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;in &s;tealing from the confe&s;ional acro&s;s the choir, and, &s;hocked on again, beholding him, he turned his eyes, and ha&s;tily quitted the church.</P>
<P>The friends then &s;eparated and the Engli&s;hman, &s;oon after returning to his hotel, received the volume. He read as follows:</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT was in the church of San Lorenzo at Naples, in the year 1758; that Vicentio di Vivaldi fir&s;t &s;aw Ellena Ro&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ba. The &s;weetne&s;s and fine expre&s;&s;ion of her voice attracted his attention to her figure, which had a di&s;tingui&s;hed air of delicacy and grace; but her face was concealed in her veil. So much indeed was he facinated by the voice, that a mo&s;t painful curi|o&s;ity was excited as to her countenance, which he fancied mu&s;t expre&s;s all the &s;en&s;ibility of character that the modulation of her tones indicated. He li&s;tened to their exqui&s;ite expre&s;&s;ion with a rapt attention, and hardly withdrew his eyes from her per&s;on till the matin &s;ervice had concluded; when he ob&s;erved her leave the church, with an aged lady, who leaned upon her arm, and who appeared to be her mother.</P>
<P>Vivaldi immediately followed their &s;teps, determi|ned to obtain, if po&s;&s;ible, a view of Ellena's face, and and to di&s;cover the home to which &s;he &s;hould retire. They walked quickly, looking niether to the right or left, and as they turned into the Strada di Toledo he had nearly lo&s;t them; but quickening his pace, and re|linqui&s;hing the cautious di&s;tance he had hitherto kept-he overtook them as they entered on the Terrazzo Nuovo&punc; which runs along the bay of Naples, and leads
<PB N="10" REF="032735_0008_0FF4935925959500">
towards the Gran Cor&s;o. He overtook them; but the fair unknown &s;till held her veil clo&s;e, and he knew not how to introduce him&s;elf to her notice or to ob|tain a view of the features, which excited his curio&s;i|ty. He was embarra&s;&s;ed by a re&s;pectful timidity, that mingled with his admiration, and which kept him &s;i|lent, notwith&s;tanding his wi&s;h to &s;peak.</P>
<P>In de&s;cending the la&s;t &s;teps of the <HI>Terrazzo,</HI> how|ever, the foot of the elder lady faultered, and, while Vivaldi, ha&s;tened to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, the breeze from the water caught the veil, which Ellena had no longer a hand &s;ufficiently di&s;engaged to confine, and, wafting it partially a&s;ide, di&s;clo&s;ed to him a countenance more touchingly beautiful than he had dared to imagine. Her features were of the Grecian outline, and, though they expre&s;&s;ed the tranquility of an elegant mind, her dark blue eyes &s;parkled with intelligence. She was a&s;&s;i&s;ting her companion &s;o anxiou&s;ly, that &s;he did not imediately ob&s;erve the admiration &s;he had in&s;pired; but the moment her eyes met tho&s;e of Vivaldi, &s;he be|came con&s;cious of their effect, and &s;he ha&s;tily drew her veil,</P>
<P>The old lady was not materially hurt by her fall, as &s;he walked with dificulty, Vivaldi &s;iezed the op|portunity thus offered, and in&s;i&s;ted that &s;he &s;hould ex|cept his arm. She refu&s;ed this with many acknow|ledgements; but he pre&s;&s;ed &s;o repeatedly and re&s;pect|fully, that; at length, &s;he accepted it, and they walked towards her re&s;idence together.</P>
<P>On the way thither, he attempted to conver&s;e with Ellena, but her replies were conci&s;e and he arrived at the end of the walk while he was yet con&s;idering what he could &s;ay, that might intere&s;t and withdraw her from this &s;evere re&s;erve. From the &s;tyle of their re&s;idence, he imagined they were per&s;ons of honorable but moderate independence. The hou&s;e was &s;mall, but exhibited an air of comfort, and even of ta&s;te. It
<PB N="11" REF="032735_0009_0FF46DEF0CF69E68">
&s;tood on an eminence, &s;urrounded by a garden and vineyards, which commanded the city and bay of Na|ples, an ever-moving picture, and was canopied by a thick grove of pines and maje&s;tic date-trees; and though the little portico and colonade in front were of common marble, the &s;tyle of architect was elegant. While they afforded a &s;helter from the &s;un, they ad|mitted the cooling breezes that ro&s;e from the bay be|low, and a pro&s;pect of the whole &s;cope of its enchant|ing &s;hores.</P>
<P>Vivaldi &s;topped at the little gate, which led into the garden, where the elder lady repeated her acknow|ledgement for his care, but did not invite him to en|ter; and he, trembling with anxiety and &s;inking with di&s;appointment, remained for a moment gazing upon Ellena, unable to take leave, yet irre&s;olute what to &s;ay that might prolong the interview, till the old lady again bade him good-day. He then &s;ummoned cou|rage enough to reque&s;t he might be allowed to en|quire after her health, and, having obtained her per|mi&s;&s;ion, his eyes bade adieu to Ellena, who, as they were parting, ventured to thank him for the care he had taken of her aunt. The &s;ound of her voice, and his acknowledgment of obligation, made him le&s;s willing to go than before, but at length he tore him|&s;elf away. The beauty of her countenance haunting his imagination, and the touching accents of her voice &s;till vibrating on his heart, he de&s;cended to the &s;hore below her re&s;idence, plea&s;ing him&s;elf with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being near her, though he could no longer behold her; and &s;ometimes hoping that he might again &s;ee her, however di&s;tantly, in a balcony of the hou&s;e, where the &s;ilk awning &s;eemed to invite the breeze from the &s;ea. He lingered hour after hour, &s;tretched beneath the umbrageous pines that waved over the &s;hore, or traver&s;ing, regardle&s;s of the heat, the ba&s;e of the cliffs that crowned it; recalling to his
<PB N="12" REF="032735_0010_0FF4935AAC278720">
fancy the enchantment of her &s;mile, and &s;eeming &s;till to li&s;ten to the &s;weetne&s;s of her accents,</P>
<P>In the evening he returned to his father's palace at Naples, thoughtful yet plea&s;ed, anxious yet happy; dwelling with delightful hope on the remembrance of the thanks he had received from Ellena, yet not daring to form any plan as to his future conduct. He re|turned time enough to attend his mother in her even|ing ride on the Cor&s;o, where, in every gay carriage that pa&s;&s;ed he hoped to &s;ee the object of his con&s;tant thought; but &s;he did not appear. His mother, the Marche&s;a di Vivaldi, ob&s;erved his anxiety and un|u&s;ual &s;ilence, and a&s;ked him &s;ome que&s;tions, which &s;he meant &s;hould lead to an explanation of the change in his manners; but his replies only excited a &s;trong|er curio&s;ity, and though &s;he forbore to pre&s;s her enquiries, it was probable that &s;he might employ a more artful means of renewing them.</P>
<P>Vincentio di Vivaldi was the only &s;on of the Mar|che&s;e di Vivaldi, a nobleman of one of the mo&s;t ancient families of the kingdom of Naples, a favourite po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an uncommon &s;hare of influence at Court, and a man &s;till higher in power than in rank. His pride of birth was equal to either, but it was mingled with the ju&s;tifiable pride of a principled mind; it governed his conduct in morals as well as in the jealou&s;y of ceremonial di&s;tinctions, and elevated his practice as well as his claims. His pride was at once his vice and his virtue, his &s;afeguard and his weak|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The mother of Vivaldi, de&s;cended from a family as ancient as that of his father, was equally jealous of her importance; but her pride was that of birth and di&s;tinction, without extending to morals. She was of violent pa&s;&s;ions, haughty, vindictive, yet crafty and deceitful; patient in &s;tratagem, and indefatigable in pur&s;uit of vengeance, on the unhappy objects who
<PB N="13" REF="032735_0011_0FF46DF0C8549D38">
provoked her re&s;entment. She loved her &s;on, rather as being the la&s;t of two illu&s;trious hou&s;es, who was to re-unite and &s;upport the honor of both, than with the fondne&s;s of a mother.</P>
<P>Vicentio inherited much of the character of his fa|ther, and very little of that of his mother. His pride was as noble and as generous as that of the Marche&s;e; but he had &s;omewhat of the fiery pa&s;&s;ions of the Mar|che&s;a, without any of her craft, her duplicity, or vin|dictive thir&s;t of revenge. Frank in his temper, in|genuous in his &s;entiments. quickly offended, but ea|&s;ily appea&s;ed; irritated by any appearance of di&s;re&s;|pect, but melted by a conce&s;&s;ion, a high &s;en&s;e of ho|nor rendered him no more jealous of offence, than a delicate humanity made him ready for reconciliation, and anxious to &s;pare the feelings of others.</P>
<P>On the day following that, on which he had &s;een Ellena, he returned to the villa Altieri, to u&s;e the permi&s;&s;ion granted him on enquiring after the health of Signora Bianchi. The expectation of &s;eeing El|lena agitated him with impatient joy and trembling hope, which &s;till, encrea&s;ed as he approached her re|&s;idence, till, having reached the garden-gate, he was obliged to re&s;t for a few moments to recover breath and compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>Having announced him&s;elf to an old female &s;ervant, who came to the gate, he was &s;oon after admitted to a &s;mall ve&s;tibule, where he found Signora Bianchi wind|ing balls of &s;ilk, and alone; though from the po&s;ition of a chair which &s;tood near a frame for embroidery, he judged that Ellena had ju&s;t quitted the apartment.</P>
<P>Signora Bianchi received him with a re&s;erved po|litene&s;s, and &s;eemed very cautious in her replies to his enquiries after her niece, who, he hoped, every moment, would appear. He lengthened his vi&s;it till there was no longer an excu&s;e for doing &s;o; till he
<PB N="14" REF="032735_0012_0FF493646C0D11B0">
had exhau&s;ted every topic of conver&s;ation, and till the &s;ilence of Signora Bianchi &s;eemed to hint, that his departure was expected. With a heart &s;addened by di&s;appointment, and having obtained only a reluctant permi&s;&s;ion to enquire after the health of that lady on &s;ome future day, he took his leave.</P>
<P>On his way through the garden he often pau&s;ed to look back on the hou&s;e, hoping to obtain a glimp&s;e of Ellena at a lattice; and threw a glance around him, almo&s;t expecting to &s;ee her &s;eated beneath the &s;hade of the luxuriant plaintains; but his &s;earch was every where vain, and he quitted the place with the &s;low and heavy &s;tep of de&s;pondency.</P>
<P>The day was employed in endeavours to obtain in|telligence concerning the family of Ellena, but of this he procured little that was &s;atisfactory. He was told, that &s;he was an orphan, living under the care of her aunt, Signora Bianchi: that her family, which had never been illu&s;trious, was decayed in fortune, and that her only dependance was upon this aunt. But he was ignorant of what was very true, though very &s;ecret, that &s;he a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;upport this aged relative, who&s;e &s;ole property was the &s;mall e&s;tate on which they lived, and that &s;he pa&s;&s;ed whole days in embroid|ering &s;ilks, which were di&s;po&s;ed of to the nuns of a neighbouring convent, who &s;old them to the Neapo|litan ladies, that vi&s;ited their grate, at a very high ad|vantage. He little thought, that a beautiful robe, which he had often &s;een his mother wear, was worked by Ellena; nor that &s;ome copies from the antique, which ornamented a cabinet of the Vivaldi palace, were drawn by her hand. If he had known the&s;e circum&s;tances, they would only have &s;erved to en|crea&s;e the pa&s;&s;ion, which, &s;ince they were proofs of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">parity of fortune, that would certainly render his family repugnant to a connection with hers, it would have been prudent to di&s;courage.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="032735_0013_0FF46DF5B72E7ED0">
Ellena could have endured poverty, but not contempt; and it was to protect her&s;elf from this effect of the narrow prejudices of the world around her, that &s;he had &s;o cautiou&s;ly concealed from it a knowledge of the indu&s;try, which did honor to her character. She was not a&s;hamed of poverty or the indu&s;try which overcame it, but her &s;pirit &s;hrunk from the &s;en&s;ele&s;s &s;mile and humiliating con|de&s;cen&s;ion, which pro&s;perity &s;ometimes gives to in|digence. Her mind was not yet &s;trong enough, or her views &s;ufficiently enlarged, to teach her a con|tempt of the &s;neer of vicious folly, and to glory in the dignity of virtuous independence, Ellena was the &s;ole &s;upport of her aunt's declining years; was patient of her infirmities, and con&s;oling to her &s;ufferings; and repaid the fondne&s;s of a mother with the affection of a daughter. Her mother &s;he had never known, hav|ing lo&s;t her while &s;he was an infant, and from that period Signora Bianchi had performed the duties of one for her.</P>
<P>Thus innocent and happy in the &s;ilent performance of her duties and in the veil of retirement, lived Elle|na Ro&s;alba, when &s;he fir&s;t &s;aw Vincentio di Vivaldi. He was not a figure to pa&s;s unob&s;erved when &s;een, and Ellena had been &s;truck by the &s;pirit and dignity of his air, and by his countenance, &s;o frank, noble, and full of that kind of expre&s;&s;ion, which announces the energies of the &s;oul. But &s;he was cautious of ad|mitting a &s;entiment more tender than admiration, and endeavour to di&s;mi&s;s his image from her mind, and by engaging in her u&s;ual occupations, to recover the &s;tate of tranquility, which his appearance had &s;omewhat interrupted.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, mean while, re&s;tle&s;s from di&s;appointment, and impatient from anxiety, having pa&s;&s;ed the greater part of the day in enquiries, which repaid him only with doubt and apprehen&s;ion, determined to return to
<PB N="16" REF="032735_0014_0FF49365F4D31A10">
the villa Altieri, when evening &s;hould conceal his &s;teps, con&s;oled by the certainty of being near the ob|ject of his thoughts, and hoping, that chance might favour him once more with a view, however, tran&s;i|ent of Ellena.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a Vivaldi held an a&s;&s;embly this even|ing, and a &s;u&s;picion concerning the impatience he be|trayed, induced her to detain him about her per&s;on to a late hour, engaging him to &s;elect the mu&s;ic for her orche&s;tra, and to &s;uperintend the performance of a new piece, the work of a compo&s;er whom &s;he had brought into fa&s;hion. Her a&s;&s;emblies were among the mo&s;t brilliant and crowded in Naples, and the nobility, who were to be at the palace this evening, were di|vided into two parties as to the merits of the mu&s;ical genius, whom &s;he patronized, and tho&s;e of another candidate for fame. The performance of the evening it was expected it would finally decide the victory. This therefore, was a night of great importance and anxiety to the Marche&s;a, for &s;he was as jealous of the reputation of her favovrite compo&s;er as of her own, and the welfare of her &s;on did but &s;lightly divide her cares.</P>
<P>The moment he could depart unob&s;erved, he quit|ted the a&s;&s;embly, and, muffling him&s;elf in his cloak, ha&s;tened to the villa Altiera, which lay at a &s;hort di&s;|tance to the we&s;t of the city. He reached it unob&s;er|ved, and breathle&s;s with impatience, traver&s;ed the the boundary of the garden; where, free from cere|monial re&s;traint and near the object of his affection, he experienced for the fir&s;t few moments a joy as ex|qui&s;ite as her pre&s;ence could have in&s;pired. But this delight faded with its novelty, and in a &s;hort time he felt as forlorn as if he was &s;eparated for ever from El|lena, in who&s;e pre&s;ence he but lately almo&s;t beleived him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The night was far advanced, and, no light appear|ing from the hou&s;e, he concluded the inhabitants had
<PB N="17" REF="032735_0015_0FF46DF824451090">
retired to re&s;t, and all hope of &s;eeing her vani&s;hed from his mind. Still, however, it was &s;weet to be near her, and he anxiou&s;ly &s;ought to gain admittance to the gardens, that he might approach the window where it was po&s;&s;ible &s;he repo&s;ed. The boundary, formed of trees and thick &s;hrubs, was not difficult to be pa&s;&s;ed, and he found him&s;elf once more in the por|tico of the villa.</P>
<P>It was nearly midnight, and the &s;tillne&s;s that reign|ed was rather &s;oothed than interrupted by the gentle da&s;hings of the waters of the bay below, and by the hollow murmurs of Ve&s;uvius, which threw up at in|tervals its &s;udden flame on the horizon, and then left it to darkne&s;s. The &s;olemnity of the &s;cene accorded with the temper of his mind, and he li&s;tened in deep attention for the returning &s;ounds, which broke upon the ear like di&s;tant thunder muttering imperfectly from the clouds. The pau&s;es of &s;ilence, that &s;ucceeded each groan of the mountain, when expectation li&s;tened for the ri&s;ing &s;ound, affected the imagination of Vivaldi at this time with particular awe, and, rapt in thought, he continued to gaze upon the &s;ublime and &s;hadowy outline of the &s;hores, and on the &s;ea, ju&s;t de&s;cerned be|neath the twilight of a cloudle&s;s &s;ky. along its grey &s;urface many ve&s;&s;els were pur&s;uing their &s;ilent cour&s;e, guided over the deep waters only by the polar &s;tar, which burned with &s;teady lu&s;ter. The air was calm, and ro&s;e from the bay with mo&s;t balmy and refre&s;hing coolne&s;s; it &s;carcely &s;tirred the heads of the broad pines that over&s;pread the villa: and bore no &s;ounds but of the waves and the groans of the far-off moun|tain&mdash;till a chaunting of deep voices <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">welled from a di&s;tance. The &s;olemn character of the &s;train engaged his attention; he perceived that it was a requiem, and he endeavoured to di&s;|cover from what quarter it came. It advanced, though di&s;tantly, and then pa&s;&s;ed away on the air.
<PB N="18" REF="032735_0016_0FF4936781D5E4F8">
The circum&s;tance &s;truck him; he knew not it was u&s;ual in &s;ome parts of Italy to chant this &s;train over the bed of the dying; but here the mourners &s;eemed to walk on the earth, or in the air. He was not doubt|ful as to the &s;train it&s;elf;&mdash;once before he had heard it, and attended with circum&s;tances which made it im|po&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould forget it. As he now li&s;ten|ed to the choral voices &s;oftening di&s;tance, a few pa|thetic voices notes brought full upon his remembrance the divine melody he had heard Ellena utter in the church of San Lorenzo. Overcome by the recollec|tion, he &s;tarted away, and, wandering over the garden reached another &s;ide of the villa, where he &s;oon heard the voice of Ellena her&s;elf, performing the midnight hymn to the virgin, and accompanied by a lute, which &s;he touched with mo&s;t affecting and delicate expre&s;&s;i|on. He &s;tood for a moment entranced, and &s;carcely daring to breathe, le&s;t he &s;hould lo&s;e any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ote of that meek and holy &s;train' which &s;eemed to flow from a devotion almo&s;t &s;aintly, Then looking round to di&s;|cover the object of his admiration, a light i&s;&s;uing from among the bowery foliage of a clematis led him to a lattice, and &s;hewed him Ellena. The lattice had been thrown open to admit the cool air, and he had a full view of her and the apartment. She was r&s;iiug from a &s;mall altar where &s;he had concluded the &s;ervice; the glow of devotion was &s;till upon her countenance as &s;he rai&s;ed her eyes, and with rapt earne&s;tne&s;s fixed them on the heavens. She &s;till held the lute, but no longer awakened it, and &s;eemed lo&s;t to every &s;urroun-object. Her fine hair was negligently bound up in a &s;ilk net, and &s;ome tre&s;&s;es that had e&s;caped it, played on her neck, and round her beautiful countenance, which now was not even partially concealed by a viel. The light drapery of her dre&s;s, her whole figure, air, and attitude, were &s;uch as might have been copied for a Grecian nymph.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="032735_0017_0FF46DF9B6A15A00">
Vivaldi was perplexed and agitated between the wi&s;h of &s;eizing an opportunity, which might never a|gain occur, of pleading his love, and the fear of offen|ding, by intruding upon her retirement at &s;o &s;acred an hour; but, while he thus he&s;itated, he heard her &s;igh, and then with a &s;weetne&s;s peculiar to her accent, pronounce his name. During the trembling anxiety, with which he li&s;tened to what might follow this men|tion of his name, he di&s;turbed the clematis that &s;ur|rounded the lattice, and &s;he turned her eyes towards the window; but Vivaldi was entirely concealed by the foliage. She, however, ro&s;e to clo&s;e the lattice, as &s;he approached which, Vivaldi, unable any longer to command him&s;elf, appeared before her. She &s;tood fixed for an in&s;tant, while her countenance changed to an a&s;hy palene&s;s; and then, with trembling ha&s;te clo&s;ing the lattice, quitted the apartment. Vivaldi felt as if all his hopes had vani&s;hed with her.</P>
<P>After lingering in the garden for &s;ome time with|out perceiving a light in any other part of the build|ing, or hearing a &s;ound proceed from it, he took his melancholy way to Naples. He now began to a&s;k him&s;elf &s;ome que&s;tions, which he ought to have urged before, and to enpuire wherefore he &s;ought the dangerous plea&s;ure of &s;eeing Ellena, &s;ince her family was of &s;uch a condition as rendered the con&s;ent of his parents to a marriage with her unattainable.</P>
<P>He was lo&s;t in revere on this &s;ubject, &s;ometimes half re&s;olved to &s;eek her no more, and then &s;hrinking from a conduct, which &s;eemed to &s;trike him with the force of de&s;pair, when, as he emerged from the dark&punc; arch of ruin that extended over the road, his was way cro&s;&s;ed by a per&s;on in the habit of a monk, who&s;e face was &s;hrou|ded by his cowl &s;till more than by the twilight. The Stranger, addre&s;&s;ing him by his name, &s;aid, "Signor! your &s;teps are watched; beware how you revi&s;it Alte|ri!" Having uttered this, he di&s;appeared, before
<PB N="20" REF="032735_0018_0FF493690987C608">
Vivaldi could return the &s;word he had half drawn in|to the &s;cabbard, or demand an explanation of the words he had heard. He called loudly and repeatedly conjuring the unknown per&s;on to appear; and linger|ed near the &s;pot for a con&s;iderable time; but the vi&s;i|on came no more.</P>
<P>Vivaldi arrived at home with a mind occupied by this incident, and tormented by the jealou&s;y to which it gave ri&s;e; for, after indulging various conjectures, he concluded with believing the notice, of which he had been warned, tobe that of a rival, and that the dan|ger which menaced him, was from the poniard of jea|lou&s;y. This belief di&s;covered to him at once the ex|tent of his pa&s;&s;ion, and of the imprudence, which had thus readily admitted it; yet &s;o far was this new pru|dence from overcoming his error, that, &s;tung with a torture more exqui&s;ite than he had ever known, he re&s;olved, at every event, to declare his love, and &s;ue for the hand of Ellena. Unhappy young man, he knew not the fatal error, into which his pa&s;&s;ion was precipitating him.</P>
<P>On his arrival at the Vivaldi palace, he learned that the Marche&s;a had ob&s;erved his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">b&s;ence, had repeated|ly enquired for him, and had given orders that the time of his return &s;hould be mentioned to her. She had however, retired to re&s;t; but the Marche&s;e, who had attended the king on an excur&s;ion to one of the roy|al villas on the bay, returned home <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oon a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ter Vincen|tio, and, before he had withdrawn to hi<HI>s</HI> apartment, he met his &s;on with unu&s;ual di&s;plea&s;ure, but avoided &s;aying any thing, which either explained or alluded to the &s;ubject of it; and, after a &s;hort conver&s;ation they &s;eparated.</P>
<P>Vivaldi &s;hut him&s;elf in his apartment to deliberate, if that may de&s;erve the name of del<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">eration, in which a conflict o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> pa&s;&s;ions, rather than an exertion of judg|ment, prevailed. For &s;everal hours he traver&s;ed his
<PB N="21" REF="032735_0019_0FF46DFBC0A29900">
&s;uit of rooms, alternately tortured by the remembrance of Ellena, fired with jealou&s;y, and alarmed for the con|&s;equence of the imprudent &s;tep, which he was about to take. He knew the temper of his father, and &s;ome of the traits of the character of his mother, &s;ufficently to fear that their di&s;plea&s;ure would be irreconcileable concerning the marriage he meditated; yet, when he con&s;idered that he was their only &s;on, he was inclined to admit a hope of forgivene&s;s, notwith&s;tanding the weight which the circum&s;tance mu&s;t add to their di&s;|appointment. The&s;e reflections were frequently in|terrupted by &s;ears le&s;t Ellena had already di&s;po&s;ed of her affections to this imaginary rival. He was how|ever, &s;omewhat con&s;oled by remembring the &s;igh &s;he had uttered, and the tenderne&s;s, with which &s;he had immediately pronounced his name. Yet, even, if &s;he were not aver&s;e to his &s;uit, how could he &s;olicit her hand, and hope it would be given him, when he &s;hould declare that this mu&s;t be in &s;ecret? He &s;carcely da|red to beleived that &s;he would conde&s;cend to enter a family who di&s;dained to receive her? and again de&s;|pondency overcame him.</P>
<P>The morning found him as di&s;tracted as the night had left him; his determination, however, was fixed; and this was to &s;acrifice what he now con&s;idered as a delu&s;ive pride of birth, to a choice which he beleived would en&s;ure the happine&s;s of his life. But, before he ventured to declare him&s;elf to Ellena, it appeared ne|ce&s;&s;ary to a&s;certain whether he held an intere&s;t in her heart, or whether &s;he had devoted it to the rival of his love, and who this rival really was. It was &s;o much ea&s;ier to wi&s;h for &s;uch information than to obtain it, that, after forming a thou&s;and projects, either the de|licacy of his re&s;pect for Ellena, or his fear of offending her, or an apprehen&s;ion of di&s;covery from his family before he had &s;ecured an intere&s;t in her affections, con|&s;tantly oppo&s;ed his views of an enquiry.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="032735_0020_0FF493729878CD10">
In this difficulty he opened his heart to a friend, who had long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his confidence, and who&s;e ad|vice he &s;olicited with &s;omewhat more anxiety and &s;incerity than is u&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions. It was not a &s;anction of his own oppinion that he required, but the impartial judgment of another mind. Bonarmo, however little he might be qualified for the office of an advi&s;er, did not &s;cruple to give his advice. As a means of judging whether Ellena was di&s;po&s;ed to fa|vour Vivaldi's addre&s;&s;es, he propo&s;ed, that, according to the cu&s;tom of the country, a &s;erenade &s;hould be given; he maintained, that, if &s;he was not di&s;inclined towards him, &s;ome &s;ign of approbation would appear; and if otherwi&s;e, that &s;he would remain &s;ilent and in|vi&s;ible. Vivaldi objected to this coar&s;e and inadequate mode of expre&s;&s;ing a love &s;o &s;acred as his, and he had too lofty an opinion of Ellena's mind and delicacy, to believe, that the trifling homage of a &s;erenade would either flatter her &s;elf-love, or intere&s;t her in his fa|vour; nor, if it did, could he venture to believ, that &s;he would di&s;play any &s;ign of approbation.</P>
<P>His friend laughed at his &s;cruples and at his opini|on of what he called &s;uch romantic delicacy, that his ignorance of the world was his only excu&s;e for having cheri&s;hed them. But Vivaldi interrupted this raillery, and would neither &s;uffer him to &s;peak thus of Ellena, or to call &s;uch delicacy romantic. Bonarmo, however &s;till urged the &s;erenade as at lea&s;t a po&s;&s;ible means of di&s;covering her di&s;po&s;ition towards him before he made a formal avowel of his &s;uit; and Vivaldi, per|plexed and di&s;tracted with apprehen&s;ion and impati|ence to terminate his pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence, was at length &s;o far overcome by his own difficulties, ra|ther then by his friend's per&s;ua&s;ion, that he con&s;ented to make the adventure of a &s;erenade on the approach|ing night. This was adopted rather as a refuge from de&s;ponedncy, than with any hope of &s;ucce&s;s; for he
<PB N="23" REF="032735_0021_0FF46DFE33595ED8">
&s;till believed that Ellena would not give any hint, that might terminate his uncertainty.</P>
<P>Beneath their cloaks they carried mu&s;ical in&s;tru|ments, and, muffling their faces, &s;o that they could not be known, they proceeded in thoughtful &s;ilence on the way to the villa Altieri. Already they had pa&s;&s;ed the arch, in which Vivaldi was &s;topped by the &s;tranger on the proceeding night, when he heard a &s;udden &s;ound near him, and, rai&s;ing his head from the cloak, he perceived the &s;ame figure! Before he had time for exclamation, the &s;tranger cro&s;&s;ed him again. "Go not to the villa Altieri," &s;aid he in a &s;olemn voice, "le&s;t you meet the fate you ought to dread."</P>
<P>"What fate?" demanded Vivaldi, &s;tepping back; "Speak, I conjure you!"</P>
<P>But the monk was gone, and the darkne&s;s of the hour baffled ob&s;ervation as to the way of his depar|ture.</P>
<P><HI>"Dio mi guardi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">"</HI> exclaimed Bonarmo, "this is almo&s;t beyond belief! but let us return to Naples; this &s;econd warning ought to be obeyed."</P>
<P>"It is almo&s;t beyond endurance," exclaimed Vi|valdi; "which way did he pa&s;s?"</P>
<P>"He glided by me," replied Bonarmo, "and he was gone before I could cro&s;s him?"</P>
<P>"I will tempt the wor&s;t at once," &s;aid Vivaldi; "if I have a rival, it is be&s;t to meet him. Let us go on."</P>
<P>Bonarmo remon&s;trated, and repre&s;ented the &s;erious danger that threatened from &s;o ra&s;h a proceeding. "It is evident that you have a rival," &s;aid he; "and your courage cannot avail you again&s;t hired bravos." Vivaldi's heart &s;welled at the mention of a rival. "If you think it dangerous to proceed, I will go alone," &s;aid he.</P>
<P>Hurt by this reproof, Bonarmo accompanied his friend in &s;ilence, and they reached without interrup|tion
<PB N="24" REF="032735_0022_0FF493744269F738">
the boundary of the villa. Vivaldi led to the place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which he had entered on the preceding night, and they pa&s;&s;ed unmole&s;ted into the garden.</P>
<P>"Where are the&s;e terrible bravos of whom you warned me?" &s;aid Vivaldi, with taunting exultation.</P>
<P>"Speak cautiou&s;ly," replied his friend; "we may even now, be within their reach?"</P>
<P>"They al&s;o may be within ours," ob&s;erved Vi|valdi.</P>
<P>At length the&s;e adventurous friends came to the o|rangery, which was near the hou&s;e, when, tired by the a&s;cent, they re&s;ted to recover breath and to pre|pare their in&s;truments for the &s;erenade. The night was &s;till, and they now heard, for the fir&s;t time, mur|murs as of a di&s;tant multitude&punc; and then the &s;udden &s;plendour of fire works broke upon the &s;ky. The&s;e a|ro&s;e from a villa on the we&s;tern margin of the bay, and were given in honour of the birth of one of the royal princes. They &s;oared to an immence height, and, as their lu&s;tre broke &s;ilently upon the night, it lightened on the thou&s;and upturned faces of the gazing crowd, illumined the waters of the bay, with every little boat that &s;kimmed its &s;urface, and &s;hewed di&s;tinctly the whole &s;weep of its ri&s;ing &s;hores, the &s;tately city of Naples on the &s;trand below, and &s;preading far among the hills, its terraced roofs crowded with &s;pectators and the Cor&s;o tumultuous with carriages and blazing with torches.</P>
<P>While Bonarmo &s;urveyed this magnificent &s;cene, Vivaldi turned his eyes to the re&s;idence of Ellena, part of which looked out from among the trees, with a hope that the &s;pectacle would draw her to a balcony; but &s;he did not appear, nor was there any light that might indicate her approach,</P>
<P>While they &s;till re&s;ted on the turf of the orangery, they herad a ru&s;tling of the leaves, as if the branches were di&s;turbed by &s;ome per&s;on who endeavoured to
<PB N="25" REF="032735_0023_0FF46E025E63B578">
make his way between them when, Vivaldi demanded who pa&s;&s;ed. No an&s;wer was returned, and a long &s;ilence followed.</P>
<P>"We are ob&s;erved," &s;aid Bonarmo, at length, "and are even now, perhaps, almo&s;t beneath the poniard of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in: let us be gone.</P>
<P>"O that my heart were as &s;ecure from the darts of love, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of my peace," exclaimed Vivaldi, "as yours is from tho&s;e of bravos! My friend, you have little to intere&s;t you, &s;ince your thoughts have &s;o much lei&s;ure for apprehen&s;ion."</P>
<P>"My fear is that of prudence, not of weakne&s;s," retorted Bonarmo, with acrimony; "you will find, perhaps, that I have none, when you mo&s;t wi&s;h me to po&s;&s;e&s;s it."</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand you," replied Vivaldi "let us fini&s;h this bu&s;ine&s;s, and you &s;hall receive reparation, &s;ince you beleive your&s;elf injured: I am as anxious to re|pair an offence, as jealous of receiving one."</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Bonarmo, "you would repair the injury you have done your friend with his blood.</P>
<P>"Oh! never, never!" &s;aid Vivaldi, falling on his neck. "Forgive my ha&s;ty violence; allow for the di&s;traction of my mind."</P>
<P>Bonarmo returned the imbrace, "It is enough," &s;aid he; "no more, no more! I hold again my friend to my heart."</P>
<P>While this conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed, they had quitted the orangery, and reached the walls of the villa, where they took their &s;tation under a balcony that overhung the lattice, through which Vivaldi had &s;een Ellena on the preceding night. They tuned their in&s;truments, and opened the &s;erenade with a duet.</P>
<P>Vivaldi's voice was a fine tenor, and the &s;ame &s;u&s;|ceptibility, which made him pa&s;&s;ionately fond of mu|&s;ic, taught him to modulate its cadence with exqui|&s;ite delicacy, and to give his empha&s;is with the mo&s;t
<PB N="26" REF="032735_0024_0FF49375C87FA0F0">
&s;imple and pathetic expre&s;&s;ion, His &s;oul &s;eemed to breathe in the &s;ounds,&mdash;&s;o tender, &s;o imploring, yet &s;o energetic. On this night, enthu&s;ia&s;m in&s;pired him with the highe&s;t eloquence, perhaps, which mu&s;ic is capable of attaining; what might be its effect on Ellena he had no means of judging, for &s;he did not ap|pear either at the balcony or the lattice, nor give any hint of applau&s;e. No &s;ounds &s;tole on the &s;tillne&s;s of the night, except tho&s;e of the &s;erenade, nor did any light from within the villa break upon the ob&s;curity without; once, indeed, in a pau&s;e of the in&s;truments Bonarmo fancied he di&s;tingui&s;hed voices near him, as of per&s;ons who feared to be heard, and he li&s;tened at|tentively, but without a&s;certaining the truth. Some|times they &s;eemed to &s;ound heavily in his ear, and then a death-like &s;ilence prevailed. Vivaldi affirmed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound to be nothing more than the confu&s;ed murmur of the di&s;tant multitude on the &s;hore, but Bonarmo was not thus ea&s;ily convinced.</P>
<P>The mu&s;icians, un&s;ucce&s;sful in their fir&s;t endeavour to attract attention, removed to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the building, and placed them&s;elves in front of the portico, but with as little &s;ucce&s;s; and, after having exerci&s;ed their powers of harmony and of patience for above an hour, they re&s;igned all further effort to win upon the obdurate Ellena. Vivaldi, notwith|&s;tanding the feeblene&s;s of his fir&s;t hope of &s;eeing her, now &s;uffered an agony of di&s;appointment; and Bo|narmo, alarmed for the con&s;equence of his de&s;pair, was as anxious to per&s;uade him that he had no rival, as he had lately been pertinacious in affirming that he had one.</P>
<P>At length they left the gardens, Vivaldi, prote&s;t|ing that he would not re&s;t until he had di&s;covered the &s;tranger, who &s;o wantonly de&s;troyed his peace, and had compelled him to explain his ambiguous warn|ings; and Bonarmo remon&s;trating on the imprudence
<PB N="27" REF="032735_0025_0FF46E0423763770">
and difficulty of the &s;earch, and repre&s;enting that &s;uch conduct would probably be the means of &s;preading a report of his attachment, where mo&s;t he dreaded it &s;hould be known,</P>
<P>Vivaldi refu&s;ed to yield to remon&s;trance or con&s;i|derations of any kind. "We &s;hall &s;ee," &s;aid he, "whether this demon in the garb of a monk, will haunt me again at the accu&s;tomed place; if he does, he &s;hall not e&s;cape my gra&s;p; and if he does not, I will watch as vigilantly for his return, as he &s;eems to have done for mine. I will lurk in the &s;hade of the ruin, and wait for him, though it be till death!"</P>
<P>Bonarmo was particularly &s;truck by the vehemence which he pronounced the la&s;t words, but he no longer oppo&s;ed his purpo&s;e, and only bade him con&s;ider whe|ther he was well armed, "For" he added, "you may have need of arms there, though you had no u&s;e for them at the villa Altieri. Remember that the &s;trang|er told you that your &s;teps were watched."</P>
<P>"I have my &s;word," replied Vivaldi, "and the dagger which I u&s;ually wear; but I ought to enquire what are your weapons of defence."</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h!" &s;aid Bornarmo, as they turned the foot of a rock that overhung the road, "we are approach|ing the &s;pot; yonder is the arch!" It appeared du&s;ki|ly in the per&s;pective, &s;u&s;pended between two cliffs, where the road wound from &s;ight, on one of which were the ruins of the Roman fort it belonged to, and on the other, &s;hadowing pines, and thickets of oak that tufted the rock to its ba&s;e.</P>
<P>They proceeded in &s;ilence, treading lightly, and of|ten throwing a &s;u&s;picious glance around, expecting every in&s;tant that the monk would &s;teal out upon them from &s;ome rece&s;s of the cliffs. But they pa&s;&s;ed on un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ole&s;ted to the arch-way. "We are here before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">im, however," &s;aid Vivaldi as they entered the dark|ne&s;s. "Speak low, my friend," &s;aid Bonarmo, "o|thers
<PB N="28" REF="032735_0026_0FF493774D578AE8">
be&s;ides our&s;elves may be &s;hrouded in this ob&s;cu|rity. I like not the place."</P>
<P>"Who but our&s;elves would chu&s;e &s;o di&s;mal a re|treat?" whi&s;pered Vivaldi, "unle&s;s indeed, it were banditti; the &s;avagene&s;s of the &s;pot would, in truth, &s;uit their humour, and it &s;uits well al&s;o with my own."</P>
<P>"It would &s;uit their purpo&s;e too, as well as their humour," ob&s;erved Bonarmo. "Let us remove from this deep &s;hade, into the more open road, where we can as clo&s;ely ob&s;erve who pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Vivaldi objected that in the road they might them|&s;elves be ob&s;erved, "and if we are &s;een by my un|known tormentor, our de&s;ign is defeated, for he comes upon us &s;uddenly, or not at all, le&s;t we &s;hould be pre|pared to detain him.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, as he &s;aid this, took his &s;tation within the thicke&s;t gloom of the arch, which was of con&s;iderable depth, and near a flight of &s;teps that was cut in the rock, and a&s;cended to the fortre&s;s. His friend &s;tep|ped clo&s;e to his &s;ide. After a pau&s;e of &s;ilence, du|ring which Bonarmo was meditating, and Vivaldi was impatiently watching, "do you really believe," &s;aid the former, "that any effort to detain him would be effectual? He glided pa&s;t me with a &s;trange faci|lity, it was &s;urely more than human!"</P>
<P>"What is it you mean?" enquired Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Why, I mean that I could be &s;uper&s;titious. This place, perhaps, infects my mind with congenial gloom, for I find that, at this moment, there is &s;carce|ly a &s;uper&s;tition too dark for my credulity."</P>
<P>Vivaldi &s;miled. "And&punc; you mu&s;t allow," added Bonarmo, "that he has appeared under circum&s;tan|ces &s;omewhat extraordinary. How &s;hould he know your name, by which you &s;ay he addre&s;&s;ed you at the fir&s;t meeting? How &s;hould he know from whence you came, or whether you de&s;igned to return? By what magic could he become acquainted with your plans?"</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="032735_0027_0FF46E05B2577380">
"Nor am I certain that he is acquainted with them," ob&s;erved Vivaldi; "but if he is, there was no nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uperhuman means to obtain &s;uch knowledge."</P>
<P>"The re&s;ult of this evening &s;urely ought to con|vince you that he is acquainted with your de&s;igns," &s;aid Bonarmo. Do you believe it po&s;&s;ible that Elle|na could have been in&s;en&s;ible to your attentions, "if her heart had not been pre-engaged, and that &s;he would not have &s;hewn her&s;elf at a lattice?"</P>
<P>"You do not know Ellena," replied Vivaldi, "and therefore I once more pardon you the que&s;tion. Yet had &s;he been di&s;po&s;ed to accept my addre&s;&s;es, &s;urely &s;ome &s;ign of approbation,"&mdash;he checked him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"The &s;tranger warned you not to go to the villa Altieri," re&s;umed Bonarmo, "he &s;eemed to anticipate the reception which awaited you, and to know a dan|ger, which hitherto you have happily e&s;caped."</P>
<P>"Yes, he anticipated too well that reception," &s;aid Vivaldi, lo&s;ing, his prudence in pa&s;&s;ionate exclamati|on; "and he is him&s;elf, perhaps, the rival, whom he has taught me to &s;u&s;pect. He has a&s;&s;umed a di&s;gui&s;e only the more effectually to impo&s;e upon my credulity, and do deter me from addre&s;&s;ing Ellena. And &s;hall I tamely lie in wait for his approach? Shall I lurk like a guilty a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in for his rival?"</P>
<P>"For heaven's &s;ake!" &s;aid Bonarmo, "moderate the&s;e tran&s;ports; con&s;ider where you are. This &s;ur|mi&s;e of yours is in the highe&s;t degree improbable." He gave his rea&s;ons for thinking &s;o, and the&s;e convin|ced Vivaldi, who was prevailed upon to be once more patient.</P>
<P>They had remained watchful and &s;till for a con&s;i|derable time, when Bon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">mo &s;aw a per&s;on approach the end of the arch-way neare&s;t to Altieri. He heard no &s;tep, but he perceived a &s;hadowy figure &s;ta|tion it&s;elf at the entrance of the arch, where the twi|light
<PB N="30" REF="032735_0028_0FF49380DF131018">
of this brilliant climate was, for a few paces, ad|mitted. Vivaldi's eyes were fixed on the road lead|ing towards Naples, and he, therefore, did not perceive the object of Bonarmo's attention, who, fearful of his friend's precipitancy, forbore to point out immediate|ly what he ob&s;erved, judging it more prudent to watch the motions of this unknown per&s;on, that he might a&s;certain whether it really were the monk. The &s;ize of the figure, and the dark drapery in which it &s;eem|ed wrapt, induced him, at length, to believe that this was the expected &s;tranger; and he &s;eized Vivaldi's arm to direct his attention to him, when the form glided forward di&s;appeared in the gloom, but not be|fore Vivaldi had under&s;tood the occa&s;ion of his friend's ge&s;ture and &s;ignificant &s;ilence. They heard no foot|&s;tep pa&s;s them, and, being convinced that this per&s;on, whatever he was, had not left the arch-way, they kept their &s;tation in watchful &s;tillne&s;s. Pre&s;ently they heard a ru&s;tling, as of garments, near them, and Vi|valdi, unable longer to command his patience, &s;tarted from his concealment, and with arms extended to prevent any one from e&s;caping, demanded who was there.</P>
<P>The &s;ound cea&s;ed, and no reply was made. Bonarmo drew his &s;word, prote&s;ting he would &s;tab the air till he found the per&s;on who lurked there; but if the latter would di&s;cover him&s;elf, he &s;hould receive no injury. This a&s;&s;urance Vivaldi confirmed by his promi&s;e. Still no an&s;wer was returned; but as they li&s;tened for a voice, they thought &s;omething pa&s;&s;ed them, and the avenue was not narrow enough to have prevent|ed &s;uch a circum&s;tance. Vivaldi ru&s;hed forward, but did not perceive any per&s;on i&s;&s;ue from the arch in|to the highway, where the &s;tronger twilight mu&s;t have di&s;covered him.</P>
<P>"Somebody certainly pa&s;&s;ed," whi&s;pered Bonar|mo, "and I think I hear a &s;ound from yonder &s;teps, that lead to the fortre&s;s."</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="032735_0029_0FF46E0856E23B08">
"Let us follow," cried Vivaldi, and he began to a&s;cend.</P>
<P>"Stop, for heaven's &s;ake &s;top!" &s;aid Bonarmo; "con&s;ider what you are about! Do not brave the ut|ter darkne&s;s of the&s;e ruins; do not pur&s;ue the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in to his den!"</P>
<P>"It is the monk him&s;elf! exclaimed Vivaldi, &s;till a&s;cending; "he &s;hall not e&s;cape me!"</P>
<P>Bonarmo pau&s;ed a moment at the foot of the &s;teps, and his friend di&s;appeared; he he&s;itated what to do, till a&s;hamed of &s;uffering him to encounter danger a|lone, he &s;prang to the flight, and not without difficul|ty &s;urmounted the rugged &s;teps.</P>
<P>Having reached the &s;ummit of the rock, he found him&s;elf on a terrace, that ran along the top of the arch|way and had once been fortified; this, cro&s;&s;ing the road, commanded the defile each way. Some remains of ma&s;&s;y walls, that &s;till exhibited loops for archers, were all that now hinted of its former u&s;e. It led to a watch-tower almo&s;t concealed in thick pines, that crowned the oppo&s;ite cliff, and had thus &s;erved not only for a &s;trong battery over the road, but connecting the oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the defile, had formed a line of communication between the fort and this out-po&s;t.</P>
<P>Bonarmo looked round in vain for his friend, and the echoes of his own voice only, among the rocks, replied to his repeated calls. After &s;ome he&s;itation whether to enter the walls of the main building, or to cro&s;s to the watch-tower, he determined on the former, and entered a rugged area, the walls of which, following the declivities of the precipice, could &s;carce|ly now be traced. The citadel, a round tower, of maje&s;tic &s;trength, with &s;ome Roman arches &s;cattered near, was all that remained of this once important fortre&s;s; except, indeed, a ma&s;s of ruins near the edge of the cliff, the con&s;truction of which made it difficult to gue&s;s for what purpo&s;e it had been de&s;igned.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="032735_0030_0FF4938268280780">
Bonarmo entered the immen&s;e walls of the citadel, but the utter darkne&s;s within checked his progre&s;s, and, contenting him&s;elf with calling loudly on Vi|valdi, he returned to the open air.</P>
<P>As he approached the ma&s;s of ruins, who&s;e &s;in|gular form had intere&s;ted his curio&s;ity, he thought he di&s;tingui&s;hed the low accents of a human voice, and while he li&s;tened in anxiety, a per&s;on ru&s;hed forth from a door-way of the ruin, carrying a drawn &s;word. It was Vivaldi him&s;elf. Bonarmo &s;prang to meet him; he was pale and breathle&s;s, and &s;ome moments elap&s;ed before he could &s;peak, or appeared to hear the repeated enquiries of his friend.</P>
<P>"Let us go," &s;aid Vivaldi, "let us leave this place."</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t willingly," replied Bonarmo, "but where have you been, and who have you &s;een, that you are thus affected?"</P>
<P>"A&s;k me no more que&s;tions, let us go,' repeated Vivaldi.</P>
<P>They de&s;cended the rock together, and when having reached the arch way, Bonarmo enquired, half &s;por|tively, whether they &s;hould remain any longer on the watch, his friend an&s;wered, "No!" with an empha&s;is that &s;tartled him. They pa&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily on the way to Naples, Bonarmo repeating enquiries which Vivaldi &s;eemed reluctant to &s;atisfy, and wondering no le&s;s at the cau&s;e of this &s;udden re&s;erve, than anxious to know whom he had &s;een.</P>
<P>"It was the monk, then," &s;aid Bonarmo; "you &s;ecured him at la&s;t?"</P>
<P>"I know not what to think," replied Vivaldi, "I am more perplexed than ever."</P>
<P>"He e&s;caped you then?"</P>
<P>"We will &s;peak of this in future," &s;aid Vivaldi; "but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e it as it may, the bu&s;ine&s;s re&s;ts not here. I will return in the night of to-morrow with a torch; dare you venture your&s;elf with me?"</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="032735_0031_0FF46E0C72BE0D20">
"I know not," replied Bonarmo, "whether I ought to do &s;o, &s;ince I am not informed for what purpo&s;e?"</P>
<P>"I will not pre&s;s you to go," &s;aid Vivaldi; my purpo&s;e is already known to you."</P>
<P>"Have you really failed to di&s;cover the &s;tranger&mdash;have you &s;till doubts concerning the per&s;on you pur|&s;ued?"</P>
<P>I have doubts, which to-morow night, I hope will di&s;&s;ipate."</P>
<P>"This is very &s;trange!" &s;aid Bonarmo, "It was but now that I witne&s;&s;ed the horror, with which you left this fortre&s;s of Puluzzi, and already you &s;peak of returning to it! And why at night&mdash;why not in the day, when le&s;s danger would be&s;et you?"</P>
<P>"I know not as to that," replied Vivaldi, "you are to ob&s;erve that day-light never pierces within the rece&s;s, to which I penetrated; we mu&s;t &s;earch the place with torches at what&s;oever hour we would ex|amine it."</P>
<P>"Since this is nece&s;&s;ary," &s;aid Bonarmo, "how happens it that you found your way in total darkne&s;s?"</P>
<P>"I was too much engaged to know how; I was led on, as by an invi&s;ible hand."</P>
<P>"We mu&s;t, notwith&s;tanding," ob&s;erved Banarmo, "go in day-time, if not by day-light, provided I ac|company you. It would be little le&s;s than in&s;anity to go twice to a place, which is probably infe&s;ted with robbers, and at their own hour of midnight."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall watch again in the accu&s;tomed place," re|plied Vivaldi, "before I u&s;e my la&s;t re&s;ource, and this cannot be done during the day. Be&s;ides, it is nece&s;|&s;ary that I &s;hould go at a particular hour, the hour when the monk has u&s;ually appeared.</P>
<P>"He did e&s;cape you, then?" &s;aid Bonarmo, "and you are &s;till ignorant concerning who he is?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi rejoined only with an enquiry whether his friend would accompany him. "If not," he added&punc; "I mu&s;t hope to find another companion."</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="032735_0032_0FF49383ED06D330">
Bonarmo &s;aid, that he mu&s;t con&s;ider of the propo&s;al, and would acquaint him with his determination be|fore the following evening.</P>
<P>While this conver&s;ation concluded, they were in Naples, and at the gates of the Vivaldi palace, where they &s;eparated for the remainder of the night.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SINCE Vivaldi had failed to procure an explanati|on of the words of the monk, he determined to relieve him&s;elf from the torture of &s;u&s;pence, re&s;pecting a rival, by going to the villa Altieri, and declaring his preten|&s;ions. On the morning immediately following his late adventure, he went thither, and on equiring for Signora Bianchi, was told &s;he could not be &s;een. With much difficulty he prevailed upon the old hou&s;e keeper to deliver a reque&s;t that he might be permitted to wait upon her for a few moments. Per|mi&s;&s;ion was granted him, when he was conducted in|to the very apartment where he had formerly &s;een Ellena. It was unoccupied, and he was told that Sig|nora Bianchi would be there pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>During this interval, he was agitated at one mo|ment with quick impatience, and at another with en|thu&s;ia&s;tic plea&s;ure, while he gazed on the altar whence he had &s;een Ellena ri&s;e, and where to his fancy, &s;he &s;till appeared; and on every object, on which he knew her eyes had lately dwelt. The&s;e objects &s;o familiar to her, had in the imagination of Vivaldi acquired &s;omewhat of the &s;acred character &s;he had impre&s;&s;ed up|on his heart, and affected him in &s;ome degree as her pre&s;ence would have done. He trembled as he took
<PB N="36" REF="032735_0034_0FF4938574769A60">
up the lute &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to touch, and, when he awakened the chords, her own voice &s;eemed to &s;peak. A drawing half-fini&s;hed, of a dancing nymph, remained on a &s;tand, and he immediately under&s;tood that her hand had traced the lines. It was a copy from Herculaneum, and though a copy, was touched with the &s;pirit of original genius. The light &s;teps ap|peared almo&s;t to move, and the whole figure di&s;play|ed the airy lightne&s;s of exqui&s;ite grace. Vivaldi per|ceived this to be one of a &s;et that ornamented the a|partment, and ob&s;erved with &s;urpri&s;e, that they were the particular &s;ubjects, which adorned his father's ca|binet, and which he had under&s;tood to be the only co|pies permitted from the originals in the royal mu|&s;eum.</P>
<P>Every object, on which his eyes re&s;ted, &s;eemed to announce the pre&s;ence of Ellena; and the very flow|ers that &s;o gaily embelli&s;hed the apartment, breathed forth a perfume, which fa&s;cinated his &s;en&s;es and affect|ed his imagination. Before Signora Bianchi appear|ed, his anxiety and apprehen&s;ion had encrea&s;ed &s;o much that, believing he &s;hould not be able to &s;upport him|&s;elf in her pre&s;ence, he was more than once upon the point of leaving the hou&s;e. At length, he heard her approaching &s;tep from the hall; and his breath al|mo&s;t for&s;ook him. The figure of Signora Bianchi was not of an order to in&s;pire admiration, and a &s;pec|tator might have &s;miled to &s;ee the perterbation of Vi|valdi, his faultering &s;tep and anxious eye, as he ad|vanced to meet the venerable Bianchi, as he bowed upon her faded hand, and li&s;tened to her querulous voice. She received him with an air of re&s;erve, and &s;ome moments pa&s;&s;ed before he could recollect him|&s;elf &s;ufficiently to explain the purpo&s;e of his vi&s;it; yet this, when he di&s;covered it, did not apparently &s;ur|prize her. She li&s;tened with compo&s;ure, though with &s;omewhat of a &s;evere countenance, to his prote&s;tations
<PB N="37" REF="032735_0035_0FF4933C1A9EF100">
of regard for her niece, and when he implored her to intercede for him in obtaining the hand of Ellena, &s;he &s;aid, "I cannot be ignorant that a family of your rank mu&s;t be aver&s;e to an union with one of mine; nor am I unacquainted that a full &s;en&s;e of the value of birth is a &s;triking feature in the characters of the Marche&s;e and Marche&s;a di Vivaldi. This propo&s;al mu&s;t be di&s;agreeable or unknown to them; and I am to in|form you, Signor, that, though Signora di Ro&s;alba is their inferior in rank, &s;he is their equal in pride."</P>
<P>Vivaldi di&s;dained to prevaricate, yet was &s;hocked to own the truth thus abruptly. The ingenious man|ner, however, with which he at length did this, and the energy of a pa&s;&s;ion too eloquent to be mi&s;under|&s;tood, &s;omewhat &s;oothed the anxiety of Signora Bian|chi, with whom other con&s;iderations began to ari&s;e. She con&s;idered that from her own age and infirmities &s;he mu&s;t very &s;oon, in the cour&s;e of nature, leave El|lena a young and friendle&s;s orphan; &s;till &s;omewhat de|pendant upon her own indu&s;try, and entirely &s;o on her di&s;cretion. With much beauty and little knowledge of the world, the dangers of her future &s;ituation ap|peared in vivid colours to the affectionate mind of Signora Bianchi; and &s;he &s;ometimes thought that it might be right to &s;acrifice con&s;iderations, which in other circum&s;tances would be laudable, to the obtain|ing for her niece the protection of a hu&s;band and a man of honour. If in this in&s;tance &s;he de&s;cended from the lofty integrity, which ought to have oppo&s;ed her con&s;ent that Ellena &s;hould clande&s;tinely enter any family, her parental anxiety may &s;often the cen&s;ure &s;he de&s;erved.</P>
<P>But before &s;he determined upon this &s;ubject, it was nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;certain that Vivaldi was worthy the confidence &s;he might repo&s;e in him. To try, al&s;o, the con&s;tancy of his affection, &s;he gave little pre&s;ent en|couragement to his hopes. His reque&s;t to &s;ee Ellena
<PB N="38" REF="032735_0036_0FF4938FC4097280">
&s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, till &s;he &s;hould have con&s;idered further of his propo&s;als; and his enquiry whether he had a rival, and, if he had, whether Ellena was di&s;|po&s;ed to favour him, &s;he evaded, &s;ince &s;he knew that a reply would give more encouragement to his hopes, than it might hereafter be proper to confirm.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, at length took his leave, relea&s;ed, indeed, from ab&s;olute de&s;pair, but &s;carcely encouraged to hope; ignorant that he had a rival, yet doubtful whether Ellena honoured him&s;elf with any &s;hare of her e&s;teem.</P>
<P>He had received permi&s;&s;ion to wait upon Signora Bianchi on a future day, but till that day &s;hould ar|rive time appeared motionle&s;s; and, &s;ince it &s;eemed utterly impo&s;&s;ible to endure this interval of &s;u&s;pence, his thoughts on the way to Naples were wholly en|gaged in contriving the means of concluding it, till he reached the well known arch, and looked round, though hopele&s;sly, for his my&s;terious tormentor. The &s;tranger did not appear; and Vivaldi pur&s;ued the road, determined to re-vi&s;it the &s;pot at night, and al&s;o to re|turn privately to the villa Altieri, where he hoped a &s;econd vi&s;it might procure for him &s;ome relief from his pre&s;ent anxiety.</P>
<P>When he reached home he found that the Marche&s;e, his father, had left an order for him, to await his ar|rival; which he obeyed: but the day pa&s;&s;ed without his return. The Marche&s;a, when &s;he &s;aw him, en|quired with a look that expre&s;&s;ed much, how he had engaged him&s;elf of late, and completely fru&s;trated his plans for the evening, by requiring him to attend her to Portici. Thus he was prevented from watching at Paluzzi, and from revi&s;iting Ellena's re&s;idence.</P>
<P>He remained at Portici the following evening, and, on his return to Naples, the Marche&s;e being again ab&s;ent, he continued ignorant of the intended &s;ubject of the interview. A note from Bonarmo brought a refu&s;al to accompany him to the fortre&s;s, and urged
<PB N="39" REF="032735_0037_0FF4933DA4B268C0">
him to forbear &s;o dangerous a vi&s;it. Being for this night unprovided with a companion for the adventure, and unwilling to go alone, Vivaldi deferred it to another evening; but no con&s;ideration could deter him from vi&s;iting the villa Altieri. Not chu&s;ing to &s;olicit his friend to accompany him thither, &s;ince he had refu&s;ed his fir&s;t reque&s;t, he took his &s;olitary lute, and reached the garden at an earlier hour than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>The &s;un had been &s;et above an hour, but the hori|zon &s;till retained &s;omewhat of a &s;affron brilliancy, and the whole dome of the &s;ky had an appearance of tran&s;|parency, peculiar to this enchanting climate, which &s;eemed to diffu&s;e a more &s;oothing twilight over the repo&s;ing world. In the &s;outh-ca&s;t the outline of Ve|&s;uvius appeared di&s;tinctly, but the mountain it&s;elf was dark and &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Vivaldi heard only the quick and eager voices of &s;ome Lazaroni at a di&s;tance on the &s;hore, as they con|tended at the &s;imple game of maro. From the bowery lattices of a &s;mall pavilion within the orangery, he perceived a light, and the &s;udden hope which it occa|&s;ioned, of &s;eeing Ellena, almo&s;t overcame him. It was impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t the opportunity of beholding her, yet he checked the impatient &s;tep he was taking, to a&s;k him&s;elf, whether it was honourable thus to &s;teal upon her retirement, and become an un&s;u&s;pected ob|&s;erver of her &s;ecret thoughts. But the temptation was too powerful for this honourable he&s;itation; the pau&s;e was momentary; and &s;tepping lightly towards the pavilion, he placed him&s;elf near an open lattice, &s;o as to be &s;hrouded from ob&s;ervation by the branches of an orange-tree, while he obtained a full view of the apartment. Ellena was alone, &s;itting in a thoughtful attitude and holding her lute, which &s;he did not play. She appeared lo&s;t to a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;urrounding objects, and a tenderne&s;s was on her countenance, which &s;eemed to tell him that her thoughts were en|gaged
<PB N="40" REF="032735_0038_0FF493914B45C9B8">
by &s;ome intere&s;ting &s;ubject. Recollecting that, when la&s;t he had &s;een her thus, &s;he pronounced his name, his hope revived, and he was going to di&s;cover him&s;elf and appear at her feet, when &s;he &s;poke, and he pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Why this unrea&s;onable pride of birth!" &s;aid &s;he, "A vi&s;ionary prejudice de&s;troys our peace.&mdash;Never would I &s;ubmit to enter a family aver&s;e to re|ceive me; they &s;hall learn, at lea&s;t, that I inherit no|bility of &s;oul. O! Vivaldi! but for this unhappy prejudice!"&mdash;</P>
<P>Vivaldi, while he li&s;tened to this, was immoveable; he &s;eemed as if entranced; the &s;ound of her lute and voice recalled him, and he heard her &s;ing the fir&s;t &s;tanza of the very air, with which he had opened the &s;erenade on a former night, and with &s;uch &s;weet pa|thos as the compo&s;er mu&s;t have felt when he was in|&s;pired with the idea.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed at the conclu&s;ion of the fir&s;t &s;tanza, when Vivaldi, overcome by the temptation of &s;uch an opportunity for expre&s;&s;ing his pa&s;&s;ion, &s;uddenly &s;truck the chords of the lute, and replied to her in the &s;econd. The tremor of his voice, though it re&s;trained his tones, heightened its eloquence. Ellena in&s;tantly recollect|ed it; her colour alternately faded and returned; and, before the ver&s;e concluded, &s;he &s;eemed to have lo&s;t all con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s. Vivaldi was now advancing into the pavilion, when his approach recalled her; &s;he waved him to retire, and before he could &s;pring to her &s;up|port, &s;he ro&s;e and would have left the place, had he not interrupted her and implored a few moments at|tention.</P>
<P>"It is impo&s;&s;ible," &s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P>"Let me only hear you &s;ay that I am not hateful to you," rejoined Vivaldi; "that this intru&s;ion has not deprived me of the regard, with which but now you acknowledged you honoured me."&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="032735_0039_0FF4933F2CFE0930">
"Oh, never, never!" interrupted Ellena, impa|tiently; "forget that I ever made &s;uch acknowledge|ment; forget that you ever heard it; I know not what I &s;aid."</P>
<P>"Ah, beautiful Ellena! do you think it po&s;&s;ible I ever can forget it? It will be the &s;olace of my &s;oli|tary hours, the hope that &s;hall &s;u&s;tain me."</P>
<P>"I cannot be detained, Signor," interrupted Ellena, &s;till more embarra&s;&s;ed, "o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> forgive my&s;elf for having permitted &s;uch conver&s;ation!" but as &s;he &s;poke the la&s;t words, an involuntary &s;mile &s;eemed to contradict their meaning. Vivaldi believed the &s;mile in &s;pite of the words; but, before he could expre&s;s the lightning joy of conviction, &s;he had left the pavilion; he followed through the garden&mdash;but &s;he was gone.</P>
<P>From this moment Vivaldi &s;eemed to have ari&s;en into a new exi&s;tence; the whole world to him was Paradi&s;e; that &s;mile &s;eemed impre&s;&s;ed upon his heart for ever. In the fulne&s;s of pre&s;ent joy, he believed it impo&s;&s;ible that he ever could be unhappy again, and defied the utmo&s;t malice of future fortune. With foot&s;teps light as air, he returned to Naples, nor once remembered to look for his old monitor on the way.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e and his mother being from home, he was left at his lei&s;ure to indulge the rapturous re|collection, that pre&s;&s;ed upon his mind, and of which he was impatient of a moment's interruption. All night he either traver&s;ed his apartment with an agita|tion equal to that, which anxiety had &s;o lately inflict|ed, or compo&s;ed and de&s;troyed letters to Ellena; &s;ome|times fearing that he had written too much, and at others feeling that he had written too little; recollect|ing circum&s;tances which he ought to have mentioned, and lamenting the cold expre&s;&s;ion of a pa&s;&s;ion, to which it appeared that no language could do ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="032735_0040_0FF49392D1B537E8">
By the hour when the dome&s;tics had ri&s;en, he had, however, completed a letter &s;omewhat more to his &s;atisfaction, and he di&s;patched it to the villa Altieri by a confidential per&s;on; but the &s;ervant had &s;carcely quitted the gates, when he recollected new arguments, which he wi&s;hed to urge, and expre&s;&s;ions to change of the utmo&s;t importance to enforce his meaning, and he would have given half the world to have recalled the me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of agitation he was &s;ummoned to attend the Marche&s;e, who had been too much engaged of late to keep his own appointment. Vivaldi was not long in doubt as to the &s;ubject of this inter|view.</P>
<P>"I have wi&s;hed to &s;peak with you," &s;aid the Mar|che&s;e, a&s;&s;uming an air of haughty &s;everity, "upon a &s;ubject of the utmo&s;t importance to your honour and happine&s;s; and I wi&s;hed, al&s;o, to give you an opportu|nity of contradicting a report, which would have oc|ca&s;ioned me con&s;iderable unea&s;ine&s;s, if I could have believed it. Happily I had too much confidence in my &s;on to credit this; and I affirmed that he too well under&s;tood what was due both to his family and him|&s;elf, to take any &s;tep derogatory from the dignity of either. My motive for this conver&s;ation, therefore, is merely to afford you a moment for refuting the calumny I &s;hall mention, and to obtain for my&s;elf authority for contradicting it to the per&s;ons who have communicated it to me."</P>
<P>Vivaldi waited impatiently for the conclu&s;ion of this exordium, and then begged to be informed of the &s;ubject of the report.</P>
<P>"It is &s;aid." re&s;umed the Marche&s;e, "that there is a young woman, who is called Ellena Ro&s;alba&mdash;I think that is the name;&mdash;do you know any per&s;on of the name?"</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="032735_0041_0FF49340B47419C0">
"Do I know!" exclaimed Vivaldi, "but pardon me, pray proceed, my Lord."</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e pau&s;ed, and regarded his &s;on with &s;ternne&s;s, but without &s;urpri&s;e. "It is &s;aid, that a young per&s;on of this name has contrived to fa&s;cinate your affections, and"&mdash;</P>
<P>"It is mo&s;t true, my Lord, that Signora Ro&s;alba has won my affections," interrupted Vivaldi with ho|ne&s;t impatience, "but without contrivance."</P>
<P>"I will not be interrupted," &s;aid the Marche&s;e, in|terrupting in his turn. "It is &s;aid that &s;he has &s;o artfully adapted her temper to yours, that, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a relation who lives with her, &s;he has reduced you to the degrading &s;ituation of her devoted &s;uitor."</P>
<P>"Signora R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;alba has, my Lord, exalted me to the honour of being her &s;uitor," &s;aid Vivaldi, unable lon|ger to command his feelings. He was proceeding, when the Marche&s;e abruptly checked him, "You avow your folly then!"</P>
<P>"My Lord, I glory in my choice."</P>
<P>"Young men," rejoined his father, "as this is the arrogance and romantic enthu&s;ia&s;m of a boy, I am wil|ling to forgive it for once, and ob&s;erve me, only for once. If you will acknowledge your error, in&s;tantly di&s;mi&s;s this new favourite."&mdash;</P>
<P>"My Lord!"</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t in&s;tantly di&s;mi&s;s her," repeated the Marche&s;e with &s;ternner empha&s;is; "and, to prove that I am more merciful than ju&s;t, I am willing, on this condition, to allow her a &s;mall annuity as &s;ome repa|ration for the depravity, into which you have a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;ink her."</P>
<P>"My Lord!" exclaimed Vivaldi agha&s;t, and &s;carce|ly daring to tru&s;t his voice; "my Lord!&mdash;depravity!" &s;truggling for breath. "Who has dared to pollute her &s;potle&s;s fame by in&s;ulting your ears with &s;uch in|famous
<PB N="44" REF="032735_0042_0FF4939457ADB8C8">
falfehoods? Tell me, I conjure you, in&s;tantly tell me, that I may ha&s;ten to give him his reward&mdash;Depravity!&mdash;an annuity&mdash;an annnity! O Ellena! Ellena!" As he pronounced her name tears of ten|derne&s;s mingled with tho&s;e of indignation.</P>
<P>"Young man," &s;aid the Marche&s;e, who had ob&s;er|ved the violence of his emotion with &s;trong di&s;plea|&s;ure and alarm, "I do not lightly give faith to report, and I cannot &s;uffer my&s;elf to doubt the truth of what I have advanced. You are deceived, and your vanity will continue the delu&s;ion, unle&s;s I conde&s;cend to ex|ert my authority, and tear the veil from your eyes. Di&s;mi&s;s her in&s;tantly, and I will adduce proof of her former character which will &s;tagger even your faith, enthu&s;ia&s;tic as it is."</P>
<P>"Di&s;mi&s;s her!" repeated Vivaldi, with calm yet &s;tern energy, &s;uch as his father had never &s;een him a&s;&s;ume; "My Lord, you have never yet doubted my word, and I now pledge you that honourable word, that Ellena is innocent. Innocent! O heavens, that it &s;hould ever be nece&s;&s;ary to affirm &s;o, and, above all, that it &s;hould ever be nece&s;&s;ary for me to vindicate her!"</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t indeed lament that it ever &s;hould," replied the Marche&s;e coldly. "You have pledged your word, which I cannot que&s;tion. I believe, therefore, that you are deceived; that you think her virtuous, notwith|&s;tanding your midnight vi&s;its to her hou&s;e. And grant &s;he is, unhappy boy! what reparation can you make her for the infatuated folly, which has thus &s;tain|ed her character? What"&mdash;</P>
<P>"By proclaiming to the world, my Lord, that &s;he is worthy of becoming my wife," replied Vivaldi, with a glow of countenance which announced the courage and exultation of a virtuous mind.</P>
<P>"Your wife!" &s;aid the Marche&s;e with a look of ineffable di&s;dain, which was in&s;tantly &s;ucceeded by one
<PB N="45" REF="032735_0043_0FF4934A83528660">
of angry alarm,&mdash;"If I believed you could &s;o far for|get what is due to the honour of your hou&s;e, I would for ever di&s;claim you as my &s;on."</P>
<P>"O! why," exclaimed Vivaldi, in an agony of conflicting pa&s;&s;ions, "why &s;hould I be in danger of forgetting what is due to a father, when I am only a&s;&s;erting what is due to innocence; when I am only defending her, who has no other to defend her! Why may not I be permitted to reconcile duties &s;o conge|nial! But, be the event what it may, I will defend the oppre&s;&s;ed, and glory in the virtue, which teaches me, that it is the fir&s;t duty of humanity to do &s;o. Yes, my Lord, if it mu&s;t be &s;o, I am ready to &s;acrifice in|ferior duties to the grandeur of a principle, which ought to expand all hearts and impel all actions. I &s;hall be&s;t &s;upport the honour of my hou&s;e by adhering to its dictates."</P>
<P>"Where is the principle;" &s;aid the Marche&s;e, im|patiently, "which &s;hall teach you to di&s;obey a father? where is the virtue which &s;hall in&s;truct you to de|grade your family?"</P>
<P>"There can be no degradation, my Lord, where there is no vice," replied Vivaldi; "and are in&s;tan|ces, pardon me, my Lord, there are &s;ome few in&s;tances in which it is virtuous to di&s;obey."</P>
<P>"This paradoxical morality," &s;aid the Marche&s;e, with pa&s;&s;ionate di&s;plea&s;ure, "and this romantic lan|guage, &s;ufficiently explain to me the character of your a&s;&s;ociates, and the innocence of her, whom you defend with &s;o chivalric an air. Are you to learn, Signor, that you belong to your family, not your family to you; that you are only a guardian of its honour, and not at liberty to di&s;po&s;e of your&s;elf? My patience will endure no more!"</P>
<P>Nor could the patience of Vivaldi endure this re|peated attack on the honour of Ellena. But while he yet a&s;&s;erted her innocence, he endeavoured to do &s;o
<PB N="46" REF="032735_0044_0FF4939DD5B2B3E8">
with the temper, which was due to the pre&s;ence of a father; and, though he maintained the independence of a man, he was equally anxious to pre&s;erve inviolate the duties of a &s;on. But unfortunately the Marche&s;e and Vivaldi differed in opinion concerning the limits of the&s;e duties; the fir&s;t extending them to pa&s;&s;ive obedience, and the latter conceiving them to conclude at a point, wherein the happinefs of an individual is &s;o deeply concerned as in marriage. They parted mutually inflamed; Vivaldi unable to prevail with his father to mention the name of his infamous infor|mant, or to acknowledge him&s;elf convinced of Elle|na's innocence; and the Merche&s;e equally un&s;ucce&s;s|ful in his endeavours to obtain from his &s;on a promi&s;e that he would &s;ee her no more.</P>
<P>Here then was Vivaldi, who only a few &s;hort hours before, had experienced a happine&s;s &s;o &s;upreme as to efface all impre&s;&s;ions of the pa&s;t, and to annihilate every con&s;ideration of the future; a joy &s;o full that it permitted him not to believe it po&s;&s;ible that he could ever again ta&s;te of mi&s;ery; he, who had felt as if that moment was an eternity, rendering him independent of all others,&mdash;even he was thus &s;oon fallen into the region of time and of &s;uffering.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent conflict of pa&s;&s;ion appeared endle&s;s; he loved his father, and would have been more &s;hocked to con&s;ider the vexation he was preparing for him, had he not been re&s;entful of the contempt he expre&s;&s;ed for Ellena. He adored Ellena; and, while he felt the impracticability of re&s;igning his hopes, was equally indignant of the &s;lander, which affected her name, and impatient to avenge the in&s;ult upon the original defamer.</P>
<P>Though the di&s;plea&s;ure of his father concerning a marriage with Ellena had been already fore&s;een, the experience of it was &s;everer and more painful than he had imagined; while the indignity offered to Ellena
<PB N="47" REF="032735_0045_0FF4934C0B2FC118">
was as unexpected as intolerable. But this circum|&s;tance furni&s;hed him with an additional argument for addre&s;&s;ing her; for, if it had been po&s;&s;ible that his love could have pau&s;ed, his honour &s;eemed now en|gaged in her behalf; and, &s;ince he had been a means of &s;ullying her fame, it became his duty to re&s;tore it. Willingly li&s;tening to the dictates of a duty &s;o plau|&s;ible, he determined to per&s;evere in his original de&s;ign. But his fir&s;t efforts were directed to di&s;cover her &s;lan|derer, and recollecting, with &s;urpri&s;e, tho&s;e words of the Marche&s;e, which had confe&s;&s;ed a knowledge of his evening vi&s;its to the villa Altieri, the doubtful warnings of the monk &s;eemed explained. He believ|ed that this man was at once the &s;py of his &s;teps, and the defamer of his love, till the incon&s;i&s;tency of &s;uch conduct with the &s;eeming friendline&s;s of his admoni|tions, &s;truck Vivaldi and compelled him to believe the contrary.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the heart of Ellena had been little le&s;s tranquil. It was divided by love and pride; but had &s;he been acquainted with the circum&s;tances of the late interview between the Marche&s;e and Vivaldi, it would have been divided no longer, and a ju&s;t regard for her own dignity would in&s;tantly have taught her to &s;ub|due, without difficulty, this infant affection.</P>
<P>Signora Bianchi had informed her niece of the &s;ub|ject of Vivaldi's vi&s;it; but &s;he had &s;oftened the ob|jectionable circum&s;tances that attended his propo&s;al, and had, at fir&s;t, merely hinted that it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed his family would approve a connection with any per&s;on &s;o much their inferior in rank as her&s;elf. Ellena, alarmed by this &s;ugge&s;tion, replied, that, &s;ince &s;he believed &s;o, &s;he had done right to reject Vivaldi's &s;uit; but her &s;igh, as &s;he &s;aid this, did not e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of Signora Bianchi, who ventured to add, that &s;he had not ab&s;olutely rejected his offers.</P>
<P>While in this and future conver&s;ations, Ellena was
<PB N="48" REF="032735_0046_0FF4939F5DCBC6F0">
plea&s;ed to perceive her &s;ecret admiration thus ju&s;tified by an approbation &s;o indi&s;putable as that of her aunt, and was willing to believe that the circum&s;tances, which had alarmed her ju&s;t pride, was no &s;o humili|ating as &s;he at fir&s;t imagined. Bianchi was careful to conceal the real con&s;iderations, which had induced her to li&s;ten to Vivaldi, being well a&s;&s;ured that they would have no weight with Ellena, who&s;e generous heart and inexperienced mind would have revolted from mingling any motives of intere&s;t with an engagement &s;o &s;acred as that of marriage. When, however, from further deliberation upon the advantages, which &s;uch an alliance mu&s;t &s;ecure for her niece, Signora Bianchi determined to encourage his views, and to direct the mind of Ellena, who&s;e affections were already engag|ed on her &s;ide, the opinions of the latter were found le&s;s ductile than had been expected. She was &s;hocked at the idea of entering clande&s;tinely the family of Vi|valdi. But Bianchi, who&s;e infirmities urged her wi&s;hes, was now &s;o &s;trongly convinced of the pru|dence of &s;uch an engagement for her niece, that &s;he determined to prevail over her reluctance, though &s;he perceived that this mu&s;t be by means more gradual and per&s;ua&s;ive than &s;he had believed nece&s;&s;ary. On the evening, when Vivaldi had &s;urpri&s;ed from Ellena an acknowledgement of her &s;entiments, her embar|ra&s;&s;ment and vexation, on her returning to the hou&s;e, and relating what had occurred, &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed to Signora Bianchi the exact &s;ituation of her heart. And when, on the following morning, his letter arrived, written with the &s;implicity and energy of truth, the aunt neglected not to adapt her remarks upon it, to the character of Ellena, with her u&s;ual addre&s;s.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, after the late interview with the Marche&s;e pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the day in con&s;idering various plans, which might di&s;cover to him the per&s;on, who had abu&s;ed the credulity of his father; and in the even|ing
<PB N="49" REF="032735_0047_0FF4934D91E79670">
he returned once more to the villa Altieri, not in &s;ecret to &s;erenade the dark balcony of his mi&s;tre&s;s, but openly, and to conver&s;e with Signora Bianchi, who now received him more courteou&s;ly than on his former vi&s;it. Attributing the anxiety in his countenance to the uncertainty, concerning the di&s;po&s;ition of her niece, &s;he was neither &s;urpri&s;ed nor offended, but ven|tured to relieve him from a part of it, by encouraging his hopes. Vivaldi dreaded le&s;t &s;he &s;hould enquire further re&s;pecting the &s;entiments of his family, but &s;he &s;pared both his delicacy and her own on this point; and, after a conver&s;ation of con&s;iderable length, he left the villa Altieri with a heart &s;omewhat &s;oothed by approbation, and lightened by hope, although he had not obtained a &s;ight of Ellena. The di&s;clo&s;ure &s;he had made of her &s;entiments on the preceding evening, and the hints &s;he had received as to tho&s;e of his fami|ly, &s;till wrought upon her mind with too much effect to permit an interview.</P>
<P>Soon after his return to Naples, the Marche&s;a, whom he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find di&s;engaged, &s;ent for him to her clo&s;et, where a &s;cene pa&s;&s;ed &s;imilar to that which had occurred with his father, except that the Marche&s;a was more dexterous in her que&s;tions, and more &s;ubtle in her whole conduct; and that Vivaldi, never for a moment, forgot the decorum which was due to a mo|ther. Managing her pa&s;&s;ions, rather than exa&s;perat|ing them, and deceiving him with re&s;pect to the de|gree of re&s;entment &s;he felt from his choice, &s;he was le&s;s pa&s;&s;ionate than the Marche&s;e in her ob&s;ervations and menaces, perhaps, only becau&s;e &s;he entertained more hope than he did of preventing the evil &s;he con|templated.</P>
<P>Vivaldi quitted her, unconvinced by her argu|ments, un&s;ubdued by her prophecies, and unmoved in his de&s;igns. He was not alarmed, becau&s;e he did not &s;ufficiently under&s;tand her character to apprehend her
<PB N="50" REF="032735_0048_0FF493A0E55B5AC0">
purpo&s;es. De&s;pairing to effect the&s;e by open vio|lence, &s;he called in an auxiliary of no mean talents, and who&s;e character and views well adapted him to be an in&s;trument in her hands. It was, perhaps, the ba&s;ene&s;s of her own heart, not either depth of reflec|tion or keenne&s;s of penetration, which enabled her to under&s;tand the nature of his; and &s;he determined to modulate that nature to her own views.</P>
<P>There lived in the Dominican convent of the Spi|rito Santo, at Naples, a man called father Schedoni; an Italian, as his name imported, but who&s;e family was unknown, and from &s;ome circum&s;tances, it ap|peared, that he wi&s;hed to throw an impenetrable veil over his origin. For whatever rea&s;on, he was never heard to mention a relative, or the place of his nati|vity, and he had artfully eluded every enquiry that approached the &s;ubject, which the curio&s;ity of his a&s;&s;o|ciates had occa&s;ionally prompted. There were cir|cum&s;tances, however, which appeared to indicate him to be a man of birth, and of fallen fortune; his &s;pirit, as it had &s;ometimes looked forth from under the di&s;|gui&s;e of his manners, &s;eemed lofty; it &s;hewed not, however, the a&s;pirings of a generous mind, but rather the gloomy pride of a di&s;appointed one. Some few per&s;ons in the convent, who had been intere&s;ted by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> appearance, believed that the peculiarities of his man|ners, his &s;evere re&s;erve and unconquerable &s;ilence, his &s;olitary habits and frequent penances, were the effect of misfortunes preying upon a haughty and di&s;or|dered &s;pirit; while others conjectured them the con|&s;equence of &s;ome hideous crime gnawing upon an awakened con&s;cience.</P>
<P>He would &s;ometimes ab&s;tract him&s;elf from the &s;oci|ety for whole days together, or when with &s;uch a di&s;|po&s;ition he was compelled to mingle with it, he &s;eemed uncon&s;cious where he was, and continued &s;hrouded in meditation and &s;ilence till he was again
<PB N="51" REF="032735_0049_0FF49400F5EB40D0">
alone. There were times when it was unknown whither he had retired, notwith&s;tanding that his &s;teps had been watched, and his cu&s;tomary haunts examined. No one ever heard him complain. The elder bro|thers of the convent &s;aid that he had talents, but denied him learning; they applauded him for the profound &s;ubtlety which he occa&s;ionally di&s;covered in argument, but ob&s;erved that he &s;eldom perceived truth when it lay on the &s;urface; he could follow it through all the labyrinths of di&s;qui&s;ition, but overlooked it, when it was undi&s;gui&s;ed before him. In fact he cared not for truth, nor &s;ought it by bold and broad argument, but loved to exert the wily cunning of his nature in hunt|ing it through artificial perplexities. At length, from a habit of intricacy and &s;u&s;picion, his vitiated mind could receive nothing for truth, which was &s;imple and ea&s;ily comprehended.</P>
<P>Among his a&s;&s;ociates no one loved him, many di&s;|liked him, and more feared him. His figure was &s;triking, but not &s;o from grace; it was &s;tall, and, though extremely thin, his limbs were large and un|couth, and as he &s;talked along, wrapt in the black garments of his order, there was &s;omething terrible in its air; &s;omething almo&s;t &s;uperhuman. His cowl, too, as it threw a &s;hade over the livid palene&s;s of his face, increa&s;ed its &s;evere character, and gave an effect to his large melancholy eye, which approached to hor|ror. His was not the melancholy of a &s;en&s;ible and wounded heart, but apparently that of a gloomy and ferocious di&s;po&s;ition. There was &s;omething in his phy&s;iognomy extremely &s;ingular, and that cannot ea&s;ily be defined. It bore the traces of many pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;eemed to have fixed the features they no longer ani|mated. An habitual gloom and &s;everity prevailed over the deep lines of his countenance; and his eyes were &s;o piercing, that they &s;eemed to penetrate at a &s;ingle glance into the hearts of men, and to read their
<PB N="52" REF="032735_0050_0FF493A26BD1D5A0">
mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts; few per&s;ons could &s;upport their &s;crutiny, or even endure to meet them twice. Yet, notwith&s;tanding all this gloom and au&s;terity, &s;ome rare occa&s;ions of intere&s;t had called forth a character upon his countenance entirely different; and he could adapt him&s;elf to the tempers and pa&s;&s;ions of per&s;ons, whom he wi&s;hed to conciliate, with a&s;toni&s;hing faci|lity, and generally with complete triumph. This monk, this Schedoni, was the confe&s;&s;or and &s;ecret ad|vi&s;er of the Marche&s;a di Vivaldi. In the fir&s;t effer|ve&s;cence of pride and indignation, which the di&s;covery of her &s;on's intended marriage occa&s;ioned, &s;he con|&s;ulted him on the means of preventing it, and &s;he &s;oon perceived that his talents promi&s;ed to equal her wi&s;hes. Each po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in a con&s;iderable degree, the power of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the other; Schedoni had &s;ubtlety with ambi|tion to urge it; and the Marche&s;a had inexorable pride, and courtly influence; the one hoped to obtain a high benefice for his &s;ervices, and the other to &s;ecure the imaginary dignity of her hou&s;e, by her gifts. Prompt|ed by &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions, and allured by &s;uch views, they concerted in private, and unknown even to the Mar|che&s;e, the means of accompli&s;hing their general end.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, as he quitted his mother's clo&s;et, had met Schedoni in the corridor leading thither. He knew him to be her confe&s;&s;or, and was not much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him, though the hour was an unu&s;ual one. Schedoni bowed his head, as he pa&s;&s;ed, and a&s;&s;umed a meek and holy countenance; but Vivaldi, as he eyed him with a penetrating glance, now recoiled with in|voluntary emotion; and it &s;eemed as if a &s;huddering pre&s;entiment of what this monk was preparing for him had cro&s;&s;ed his mind.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>VIVALDI, from the period of his la&s;t vi&s;it to Al|tieri, was admitted a frequent vi&s;itor to Signora Bian|chi, and Ellena was prevailed upon to join the party, when the conver&s;ation was always on different topics. Bianchi, under&s;tanding the di&s;po&s;ition of her niece's affections, and the accompli&s;hed mind and manners of Vivaldi, judged that he was more likely to &s;ucceed by &s;ilent attentions than by a formal declaration of his &s;entiments. By &s;uch declaration, Ellena, till her heart was more engaged in his cau&s;e, would, perhaps, have been alarmed into an ab&s;olute rejection of his addre&s;&s;es, and this was every day le&s;s likely to happen &s;o long as he had an opportunity of conver&s;ing with her.</P>
<P>Signora Bianchi had acknowledged to Vivaldi that he had no rival to apprehend; that Ellena had uni|formly rejected every admirer who had hitherto di&s;co|vered her within the &s;hade of her retirement, and that her pre&s;ent re&s;erve proceeded more from con&s;iderations of the &s;entiments of his family than from di&s;approba|tion of him&s;elf. He forbore, therefore, to pre&s;s his &s;uit, till he &s;hould have &s;ecured a &s;tronger intere&s;t in her heart, and in this hope he was encouraged by Signora Bianchi, who&s;e gentle remon&s;trances in his favour became every day more plea&s;ing and more con|vincing.</P>
<P>Several weeks pa&s;&s;ed away in this kind of inter|cour&s;e, till Ellena, yielding to the repre&s;entations of Signora Bianchi, and to the pleadings of her own
<PB N="54" REF="032735_0052_0FF493AE50FDC6F8">
heart, received Vivaldi as an acknowledged admirer, and the &s;entiments of his family were no longer re|membered, or if remembered, it was with a hope that they might be overcome by con&s;iderations more powerful.</P>
<P>The lovers, with Signora Bianch and Signor Gi|otto, a di&s;tant relation of the latter, frequently made excur&s;ions in the delightful environs of Naples; for Vivaldi was no longer anxious to conceal his attach|ment, but wi&s;hed to contradict any report injurious to his love, by the publicity of his conduct; while the con&s;ideration, that Ellena's name had &s;uffered by his late imprudence, contributed, with the un&s;u&s;pecting innocence and &s;weetne&s;s of her manners towards him, who had been the occa&s;ion of her injuries, to mingle a &s;ecret pity with his love, which obliterated all family politics from his mind, and bound her irrecoverably to his heart.</P>
<P>The&s;e excur&s;ions &s;ometimes led them to Puzzuoli, Baia, or the woody cliffs of Pau&s;ilippo, and as, on their return, they glided along the moon-light bay, the me|lodies of Italian &s;trains &s;eemed to give enchantment to the &s;cenery of this &s;hore. At this cool hour the voices of the vine-dre&s;&s;ers were frequently heard in trio, as they repo&s;ed from the labour of the day, on &s;ome plea&s;ant promontory, under the &s;hade of poplars; or the bri&s;k mu&s;ic of the dance from fi&s;hermen, on the margin of the waves below. The boatmen re&s;ted on their oars, while their company li&s;tened to voices mo|dulated by &s;en&s;ibility to finer eloquence, than is in the power of art alone to di&s;play; and at others, while they ob&s;erved the airy natural grace which di&s;tin|gui&s;hes the dance of the fi&s;hermen and pea&s;ants of Naples. Frequently as they glided round a promon|tory, who&s;e &s;haggy ma&s;&s;es impended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> over the &s;ea, &s;uch magic &s;cenes of beauty unfolded, adorned by the&s;e dancing groups on the bay beyond, as no pencil could
<PB N="55" REF="032735_0053_0FF4940D6BD709A8">
do ju&s;tice to. The deep clear waters reflected every image of the land&s;cape, the cliffs, branching into wild forms, crowned with groves, who&s;e rough foli|age often &s;pread down their &s;teeps in picture&s;que lux|uriance; the ruined villa on &s;ome bold point, peeping through the trees; pea&s;ants cabins hanging on the precipices, and the dancing figures on the &s;trand&mdash;all touched with the &s;ilver tint and &s;oft &s;hadows of moon|light. On the other hand, the &s;ea trembling with a long line of radiance, and &s;hewing in the clear di&s;tance the &s;ails of ve&s;&s;els &s;tealing in every direction along its &s;urface, pre&s;ented a pro&s;pect as grand as the land|&s;cape was beautiful.</P>
<P>One evening that Vivaldi &s;at with Ellena and Sig|nora Bianchi, in the very pavilion where he had over|heard that &s;hort but intere&s;ting &s;oliloquy, which a&s;&s;u|red him of her regard, he pleaded with more than his u&s;ual earne&s;tne&s;s for a &s;peedy marriage. Bianchi did not oppo&s;e his arguments; &s;he had been ill for &s;ome time, and believing her&s;elf to be declining fa&s;t, was anxious to have their nuptials concluded. She &s;ur|veyed with languid eyes the &s;cene that &s;pread before the pavilion. The &s;trong effulgence which a &s;etting &s;un threw over the &s;ea, &s;hewing innumerable gaily painted &s;hips, and fi&s;hing-boats returning from Santa Lucia into the port of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> no longer power to cheer her. Even the Roman tower that terminated the mole below, touched as it was with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">laming rays; and the various figures of fi&s;hermen, who lay &s;moaking beneath its walls, in the long &s;hadow, or &s;tood in the &s;un&s;hine on the beach, watching the ap|proaching boats of their comrades, combined a picture which was no longer intere&s;ting. "Alas!" &s;aid &s;he, breaking from meditative &s;ilence, "this &s;un &s;o glori|ous, which lights up all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> colouring of the&s;e &s;hores, and the glow of tho&s;e maje&s;tic mountains;
<PB N="56" REF="032735_0054_0FF493AFDD0346D0">
alas! I feel that it will not long &s;hine for me&mdash;my eyes mu&s;t &s;oon clo&s;e upon the pro&s;pect for ever!"</P>
<P>To Ellena's tender reproach for this melancholy &s;ugge&s;tion Bianchi replied only by expre&s;&s;ing an ear|ne&s;t wi&s;h to witne&s;s the certainty of her being pro|tected; adding, that this mu&s;t be &s;oon, or &s;he &s;hould not live to &s;ee it. Ellena, extremely &s;hocked both by this pre&s;age of her aunt's fate, and by the direct refer|ence made to her own condition in the pre&s;ence of Vivaldi, bur&s;t into tears, while he, &s;upported by the wi&s;hes of Signora Bianchi, urged his &s;uit with en|crea&s;ed intere&s;t.</P>
<P>"This is not a time for fa&s;tidious &s;cruples," &s;aid Bianchi, "now that a &s;olemn truth calls out to us. My dear girl, I will not di&s;gui&s;e my feelings; they a&s;&s;ure me I have not long to live. Grant me then the only reque&s;t I have to make, and my la&s;t hours will be comforted."</P>
<P>After a pau&s;e &s;he added, as &s;he took the hand of her niece, "This will, no doubt, be an awful &s;eparation to us both; and it mu&s;t al&s;o be a mournful one, Sig|nor," turning to Vivaldi, "for &s;he has been as a daughter to me, and I have, I tru&s;t, fulfilled to her the duties of a mother. Judge then, what will be her feelings when I am no more. But it will be your care to &s;ooth them."</P>
<P>Vivaldi looked at Ellena, and would have &s;poken; her aunt, however, proceeded. "My own feelings would now be little le&s;s poignant, if I did not believe that I was confiding her to a tenderne&s;s, which cannot dimini&s;h; that I &s;hould prevail with her to accept the protection of a hu&s;band. To you, Signor, I commit the legacy of my child. Watch over her future mo|ments, guard her from inquietude as vigilantly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I have done, and, if po&s;&s;ible; from misfortune! I have yet much to &s;ay, but my &s;pirits are exhau&s;ted."</P>
<P>While he li&s;tened to this &s;acred charge, and recol|lected
<PB N="57" REF="032735_0055_0FF4940EF39E08F8">
the injury Ellena had already &s;u&s;tained for his &s;ake, by the cruel obloquy which the Marche&s;e had thrown upon her character, he felt a degree of gener|ous indignation, of which he &s;carcely could conceal the cau&s;e, and a &s;ucceeding tenderne&s;s that almo&s;t melt|ed him to tears; and he &s;ecretly vowed to defend her fame and protect her peace, at the &s;acrifice of every other con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Bianchi, as &s;he concluded her exhortation, gave Ellena's hand to Vivaldi, who received it with emo|tion &s;uch as his countenance, only, could expre&s;s, and with &s;olemn fervour rai&s;ing his eyes to heaven, vowed that he never would betray the confidence thus re|po&s;ed in him, but would watch over the happine&s;s of Ellena with a care as tender, as anxious, and as un|cea&s;ing as her own; that from this moment he con&s;i|dered him&s;elf bound by ties not le&s;s &s;acred than tho&s;e which the church confers to defend her as his wife, and would do &s;o to the late&s;t moment of his exi&s;tence. As he &s;aid this, the truth of his feelings appeared in the energy of his manner.</P>
<P>Ellena, &s;till weeping, and agitated by various con|&s;iderations, &s;poke not, but withdrawing the handker|chief from her face, looked at him through her tears, with a &s;mile &s;o meek, &s;o affectionate, &s;o timid, yet &s;o confiding, as expre&s;&s;ed all the mingled emotions of her heart, and appealed more eloquently to his, than the mo&s;t energetic language could have done.</P>
<P>Before Vivaldi left the villa, he had &s;ome further conver&s;ation with Signora Bianchi, when it was agreed that the nuptials &s;hould be &s;olemnized on the following week, if Ellena could be prevailed on to confirm her con&s;ent &s;o &s;oon; and that when he return|ed the next day, her determination would probably be made known to him.</P>
<P>He departed for Naples once more with the lightly-bounding &s;teps of joy, which, however, when he ar|rived
<PB N="58" REF="032735_0056_0FF493B163534620">
there, was &s;omewhat alloyed by a me&s;&s;age from the Marche&s;e, demanding to &s;ee him in his cabinet. Vivaldi anticipated the &s;ubject of the interview, and obeyed the &s;ummons with reluctance.</P>
<P>He found his father &s;o ab&s;orbed in thought that he did not immediately perceive him. On rai&s;ing his eyes from the floor, where di&s;content and perplexity &s;eemed to have held them, he fixed a &s;tern regard on Vivaldi. "I under&s;tand," &s;aid he, "that you per&s;i&s;t in the unworthy pur&s;uit again&s;t which I warned you. I have left you thus long to your own di&s;cretion, be|cau&s;e I was willing to afford you an opportunity of retracting with grace the declaration, which you dared to make me of your principles and intentions; but your conduct has not therefore been le&s;s ob&s;erved. I am informed that your vi&s;its have been as frequent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the re&s;idence of the unhappy young woman, who was the &s;ubject of our former conver&s;ation, as formerly, and that you are as much infatuated."</P>
<P>"If it is Signora Ro&s;alba, whom your lord&s;hip means," &s;aid Vivaldi, "&s;he is not unhappy; and I do not &s;cruple to own, that I am as &s;incerely attached to her as ever. Why, my dear father," continued he, &s;ubduing the feelings which this degrading mention of Ellena had arou&s;ed, "why will you per&s;i&s;t in oppo&s;ing the happine&s;s of your &s;on; and above all, why will you continue to think unju&s;tly of her, who de&s;erves your admiration as much as my love?"</P>
<P>"As I am not a lover." replied the Marche&s;e, "and that the age of boyi&s;h credulity is pa&s;t with me, I do not wilfully clo&s;e my mind again&s;t examination, but am directed by proof and yield to conviction."</P>
<P>"What proof is it my Lord, that has thus ea&s;ily convinced you?" &s;aid Vivaldi; "Who is it that per|&s;i&s;ts in abu&s;ing your confidence, and in de&s;troying my peace?"</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e haughtily reproved his &s;on for &s;uch
<PB N="59" REF="032735_0057_0FF494107A541548">
doubts and que&s;tions, and a long conver&s;ation en&s;ued, which &s;eemed neither to reconcile the intere&s;ts or the opinions of either party. The Marche&s;e per&s;i&s;ted in accu&s;ation and menace; and Vivaldi in defending El|lena, and in affirming, that his affections and intenti|ons were unalterable.</P>
<P>Not any art of per&s;ua&s;ion could prevail with the Marche&s;e to adduce his proofs, or deliver up the name of his informer; nor any menace awe Vivaldi into a renunciation of Ellena; and they parted mutually di&s;&s;atisfied. The Marche&s;e had failed on this occa&s;i|on to act with his u&s;ual policy, for his menaces and accu&s;ations had arou&s;ed &s;pirit and indignation, when kindne&s;s and gentle remon&s;trance would certainly have awakened filial affection, and might have occa&s;ioned a conte&s;t in the brea&s;t of Vivaldi. Now, no &s;trug|gle of oppo&s;ing duties divided his re&s;olution. He had no he&s;itation on the &s;ubject of their di&s;pute; but regarding his father as a haughty oppre&s;&s;or who would rob him of his mo&s;t &s;acred right; and as one who did not &s;cruple to &s;tain the name of the innocent and the defencele&s;s, when his intere&s;t required it, upon the doubtful authority of a ba&s;e informer, he &s;uffered neither pity or remor&s;e to mingle with the re&s;olution of a&s;&s;erting the freedom of his nature; and was even more anxious than before, to conclude a marriage which he believed would &s;ecure his own happine&s;s, and the reputation of Ellena.</P>
<P>He returned, therefore, on the following day to the villa Altieri, with encrea&s;ed impatience to learn the re&s;ult of Signora Bianchi's further conver&s;ation with her niece, and the day on which the nuptials might be &s;olemnized. On the way thither, his thoughts were wholly occupied by Ellena, and he proceeded mecha|nically, and without ob&s;erving where he was, till the &s;hade which the well known arch threw over the road recalled him to local circum&s;tances, and a voice
<PB N="60" REF="032735_0058_0FF493B2E817E2B0">
in&s;tantly arre&s;ted his attention. It was the voice of the monk, who&s;e figure again pa&s;&s;ed before him, "Go not to the villa Altieri," it &s;aid &s;olemnly, "for death is in the hou&s;e!"</P>
<P>Before Vivaldi could recover from the di&s;may into which this abrupt a&s;&s;ertion and &s;udden appearance had thrown him, the &s;tranger was gone. He had e&s;caped in the gloom of the place, and &s;eemed to have retired into the ob&s;curity, from which he had &s;o &s;uddenly emerged, for he was not &s;een to depart from under the archway. Vivaldi pur&s;ued him with his voice, con|juring him to appear, and demanding who was dead; but no voice replied.</P>
<P>Believing that the &s;tranger could not have e&s;caped un&s;een from the arch by any way, but that leading to the fortre&s;s above, Vivaldi began to a&s;cend the &s;teps, when, con&s;idering that the more certain means of un|der&s;tanding this awful a&s;&s;ertion would be, to go im|mediately to the villa Altieri, he left this portentous ruin and ha&s;tened thither.</P>
<P>An indifferent per&s;on would probably have un|der&s;tood the words of the monk to allude to Signora Bianchi, who&s;e infirm &s;tate of health rendered her death though &s;udden not improbable; but to the af|frighted fancy of Vivaldi, the dying Ellena only ap|peared. His fears, however probabilities might &s;anc|tion, or the event ju&s;tify them, were natural to ar|dent affection; but they were accompanied by a pre|&s;entiment as extraordinary as it was horrible;&mdash;it oc|curred to him more than once, that Ellena was mur|dered. He &s;aw her wounded, and bleeding to death; &s;aw her a&s;hy countenance, and her wa&s;ting eyes, from which the &s;pirit of life was fa&s;t departing, turned pite|ou&s;ly on him&s;elf, as if imploring him to &s;ave her from the fate that was dragging her to the grave. And, when he reached the boundary of the garden, his whole frame trembled &s;o, with horrible apprehen&s;ion, that he
<PB N="61" REF="032735_0059_0FF4941A66D04780">
re&s;ted a while, unable to venture further towards the truth. At length he &s;ummoned courage to dare it, and, unlocking a private gate, of which he had lately received the key, becau&s;e it &s;pared him a con&s;iderable di&s;tance of the road to Naples, he approached the hou&s;e. Every place around it was &s;ilent and for&s;aken; many of the lattices were clo&s;ed, and, as he endeavour|ed to collect from every trivial circum&s;tance &s;ome conjecture, his &s;pirits &s;till &s;unk as he advanced, till, having arrived within a few paces of the portico, all his fears were confirmed. He heard from within a feeble &s;ound of lamentation, and then &s;ome notes of that &s;olemn and peculiar kind of recitative, which is in &s;ome parts of Italy the requiem of the dying. The &s;ounds were &s;o low and di&s;tant that they only murmur|ed on his ear; but, without pau&s;ing for information, he ru&s;hed into the portico, and knocked loudly at the folding doors, now clo&s;ed again&s;t him.</P>
<P>After repeated &s;ummon&s;es, Beatrice, the old hou&s;e|keeper, appeared. She did not wait for Vivaldi's enquiries. "Alas! Signor," &s;aid &s;he, "alas-a-day! who would have thought it; who would have expect|ed &s;uch a change as this! It was only ye&s;ter-evening that you was here,&mdash;&s;he was then as well as I am; who would have thought that &s;he would be dead to|day?"</P>
<P>"She <HI>is</HI> dead, then!" exclaimed Vivaldi, &s;truck to the heart; "&s;he <HI>is</HI> dead!" &s;taggering towards a pillar of the hall, and endeavouring to &s;upport him&s;elf again&s;t it. Beatrice, &s;hocked at his condition, would have gone for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but he waved her to &s;tay. "When did &s;he die?" &s;aid he, drawing breath with difficulty, "how and where?"</P>
<P>"Alas! here in the villa, Signor," replied Beatrice, weeping; "who would have thought that I &s;hould live to &s;ee this day! I hoped to have laid down my old bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es&punc; in peace."</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="032735_0060_0FF493BE5B511E48">
"What has cau&s;ed her death?" interrupted Vivaldi impatiently, "and when did &s;he die?"</P>
<P>"About two of the clock this morning, Signor; about two o'clock. O mi&s;erable day, that I &s;hould live to &s;ee it!"</P>
<P>"I am better," &s;aid Vivaldi, rai&s;ing him&s;elf, "lead me to her apartment,&mdash;I mu&s;t &s;ee her. Do not he&s;i|tate, lead me on."</P>
<P>"Alas! Signor, it is a di&s;mal &s;ight; why &s;hould you wi&s;h to &s;ee her? Be per&s;uaded; do not go, Sig|nor; it is a woeful &s;ight!"</P>
<P>"Lead me on," repeated Vivaldi &s;ternly; "or if you refu&s;e, I will find the way my&s;elf."</P>
<P>Beatrice, terrified by his look and ge&s;ture, no longer oppo&s;ed him, begging only that he would wait till &s;he had informed her lady of his arrival; but he followed her clo&s;ely up the &s;tairca&s;e and along a corridor that led round the we&s;t &s;ide of the hou&s;e, which brought him to a &s;uite of chambers darkened by the clo&s;ed lattices, through which we pa&s;&s;ed towards the one where the body lay. The requiem had cea&s;ed, and no &s;ound di&s;|turbed the awful &s;tillne&s;s that prevailed in the&s;e de|&s;erted rooms. At the door of the la&s;t apartment, where he was compelled to &s;top, his agitation was &s;uch, that Beatrice, expecting every in&s;tant to &s;ee him &s;ink to the floor, made an effort to &s;upport him with her feeble aid, but he gave a &s;ignal for her to retire. He &s;oon recovered him&s;elf and pa&s;&s;ed into the cham|ber of death, the &s;olemnity of which might have effect|ed him in any other &s;tate of his &s;pirits; but the&s;e were now too &s;everely pre&s;&s;ed upon by real &s;uffering to feel the influence of local circum&s;tances. Ap|proaching the bed on which the corp&s;e was laid, he rai&s;ed his eyes to the mourner who hung weeping over it, and beheld&mdash;Ellena! who, &s;urpri&s;ed by this &s;udden intru&s;ion, and &s;till more by the agitation of Vivaldi, repeatedly demanded the occa&s;ion of it. But
<PB N="63" REF="032735_0061_0FF4941BEE5469A0">
he had neither power nor inclination to explain a cir|cum&s;tance, which mu&s;t deeply wound the heart of Ellena, &s;ince it would have told that the &s;ame event, which excited her grief, accidentally in&s;pired his joy.</P>
<P>He did not long intrude upon the &s;acredne&s;s of &s;or+row, and the &s;hort time he remained was employed in endeavours to command his own emotion and to &s;oothe her's.</P>
<P>When he left Ellena, he had &s;ome conver&s;ation with Beatrice, as to the death of Signora Bianchi, and under&s;tood that &s;he had retired to re&s;t on the preced|ing night apparently in her u&s;ual &s;tate of health. "It was about one in the morning Signor," continued Beatrice, "I was waked out of my fir&s;t &s;leep by a noi&s;e in my lady's chamber. It is a grievous thing to me, Signor, to be waked from my fir&s;t &s;leep, and I Santa Maria forgive me! was angry at being di&s;turb|ed? So I would not get up, but laid my head upon the pillow again, and tried to &s;leep; but pre&s;ently I heard the noi&s;e again; nay now, &s;ays I, &s;omebody mu&s;t be up in the hou&s;e, that's certain. I had &s;carcely &s;aid &s;o, Signor, when I heard my young lady's voice call|ing, 'Beatrice! Beatrice!' Ah! poor young lady! &s;he was indeed in a &s;ad fright, as well &s;he might. She was at my door in an in&s;tant, and looked as pale as death, and trembled &s;o! 'Beatrice,' &s;aid &s;he, 'ri&s;e this moment; my aunt is dying.' She did not wait for my an&s;wer, but was gone directly. Santa Maria protect me! I thought I &s;hould have &s;wooned out|right."</P>
<P>"Well, but your lady?" &s;aid Vivaldi, who&s;e pa|tience the tedious circumlocution of old Beatrice had exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>"Ah! my poor lady! Signor, I thought I never &s;hould have been able to reach her room; and when I got there, I was &s;carcely more alive than her&s;elf.&mdash;There &s;he lay on her bed! O it was a grievous &s;ight
<PB N="64" REF="032735_0062_0FF493BFEDED1098">
to &s;ee! there &s;he lay, looking &s;o piteou&s;ly; I &s;aw &s;he was dying. She could not &s;peak, though &s;he tried often, but &s;he was &s;en&s;ible, for &s;he would look &s;o at Signora Ellena, and then try to &s;peak; it almo&s;t broke one's heart to &s;ee her. Something &s;eemed to lie upon her mind, and &s;he tried almo&s;t to the la&s;t to tell it; and as &s;he gra&s;ped Signora Ellena's hand, &s;he would &s;till look up in her face with &s;uch doleful expre&s;&s;ion as no one who had not a heart of &s;tone could bear. My poor young mi&s;tre&s;s was quite overcome by it, and cried as if her heart would break. Poor young lady! &s;he has lo&s;t a friend indeed, &s;uch a one as &s;he mu&s;t never hope to &s;ee again."</P>
<P>"But &s;he &s;hall find one as firm and affectionate as the la&s;t!" exclaimed Vivaldi fervently.</P>
<P>"The good Saint grant it may prove &s;o," replied Beatrice, doubtingly. "All that could be done for our dear lady," &s;he continued, "was tried, but with no avail. She could not &s;wallow what the Doctor offered her. She grew fainter and fainter, yet would often utter &s;uch deep &s;ighs, and then would gra&s;p my hand &s;o hard! At la&s;t &s;he turned her eyes from Sig|nora Ellena, and they grew duller and fixed, and &s;he &s;eemed not to &s;ee what was before her. Alas! I knew &s;he was going; her hand did not pre&s;s mine as it had done a minute or two before, and a deadly coldne&s;s was upon it. Her face changed &s;o too in a few mi|nutes! This was about two o'clock, and &s;he died before her confe&s;&s;or could admini&s;ter."</P>
<P>Beatrice cea&s;ed to &s;peak, and wept; Vivaldi almo&s;t wept with her, and it was &s;ome time before he could command his voice &s;ufficiently to enquire, what were the &s;ymptoms of Signora Bianchi's di&s;order, and whether &s;he had ever been thus &s;uddenly attacked before.</P>
<P>"Never, Signor!" replied the old hou&s;e-keeper;
<PB N="65" REF="032735_0063_0FF4941D779AFC40">
"and though to be &s;ure, &s;he had long been very in|firm, and going down, as one may &s;ay, yet,"&mdash;</P>
<P>"What is it you mean?" &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Why, Signor, I do not know what to think about my lady's death. To be &s;ure, there is nothing cer|tain; and I may only get &s;coffed at, if I &s;peak my mind abroad, for nobody would believe me, it is &s;o &s;trange, yet I mu&s;t have my own thoughts, for all that."</P>
<P>"Pray &s;peak intelligibly," &s;aid Vivaldi, "you need not apprehend cen&s;ure from me."</P>
<P>"Not from you, Signor, but if the report &s;hould get abroad, and it was known that I had &s;et it a|going."</P>
<P>"That never &s;hall be known from me," &s;aid Vi|valdi, with increa&s;ed impatience, "tell me, without fear, all that you conjecture."</P>
<P>"Well then, Signor, I will own, that I do not like the &s;uddenne&s;s of my lady's death, no, nor the manner of it, nor her appearance after death!"</P>
<P>"Speak explicitly, and to the point," &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Nay, Signor, there are &s;ome folks that will not under&s;tand if you &s;peak ever &s;o plain, I am &s;ure I &s;peak plain enough. If I might tell my mind,&mdash;I do not believe &s;he came fairly by her death at la&s;t."</P>
<P>"How!" &s;aid Vivaldi, "your rea&s;ons?"</P>
<P>"Nay, Signor, I have given them already; I &s;aid I did not like the &s;uddenne&s;s of her death, nor her ap|pearance after, nor"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Good heaven!" interrupted Vivaldi, "you mean poi&s;on."</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h, Signor, hu&s;h! I do not &s;ay that; but &s;he did not &s;eem to die naturally."</P>
<P>"Who has been at the villa lately?" &s;aid Vivaldi, in a tremulous voice.</P>
<P>"Alas! Signor, nobody has been here; &s;he lived &s;o privately that &s;he &s;aw nobody."</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="032735_0064_0FF493C1755179A0">
"Not one per&s;on?" &s;aid Vivaldi, "con&s;ider well, Beatrice, had &s;he no vi&s;itor?"</P>
<P>"Not of a long while, Signor, no vi&s;itors but your&s;elf and her cou&s;in Signor Giotto. The only other per&s;on that has been within the&s;e walls for many weeks, to the be&s;t of my remembrance, is a &s;i&s;ter of the Convent, who comes for the &s;ilks my young lady embroiders."</P>
<P>"Embroiders! What convent?"</P>
<P>"The Santa Maria della Pieta, yonder, Signor; if you will &s;tep this way to the window, I will &s;hew it you. Yonder, among the woods on the hill-&s;ide, ju&s;t above tho&s;e gardens that &s;tretch down to the bay. There is an olive ground clo&s;e be&s;ide it, and ob&s;erve, Signor, there is a red and yellowi&s;h ridge of rocks ri&s;es over the woods higher &s;till, and looks as if it would fall down upon tho&s;e old &s;pires. Have you found it, Signor?"</P>
<P>"How long is it &s;ince this &s;i&s;ter came here?" &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"There weeks at lea&s;t, Signor."</P>
<P>"And you are certain that no other per&s;on has call|ed within that time?"</P>
<P>"No other, Signor, except the fi&s;herman and the gardener, and a man who brings maccaroni, and &s;uch &s;ort of things; for it is &s;uch a long way to Naples, Signor, and I have &s;o little time."</P>
<P>"Three weeks, &s;ay you! You &s;ay three weeks, I think? Are you certain as to this?"</P>
<P>"Three weeks, Signor! Santa della Pieta! Do you believe, Signor, that we could fa&s;t for three weeks! Why, they call almo&s;t every day."</P>
<P>"I &s;peak of the nun," &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"O yes, Signor," replied Beatrice; "it is that at lea&s;t, &s;ince &s;he was here."</P>
<P>"This is &s;trange!" &s;aid Vivaldi, mu&s;ing, "but I will talk with you &s;ome other time. Meanwhile, I
<PB N="67" REF="032735_0065_0FF4941F01E3FA70">
wi&s;h you could contrive that I &s;hould &s;ee the face of your decea&s;ed lady, without the knowledge of Signora Ellena. And, ob&s;erve me, Beatrice, be &s;trictly &s;ilent as to your &s;urmi&s;es concerning her death: do not &s;uffer any negligence to betray your &s;u&s;picions to your young mi&s;tre&s;s. Has &s;he any &s;u&s;picions her&s;elf of the &s;ame nature?"</P>
<P>Beatrice replied, that &s;he believed Signora Ellena had none: and promi&s;ed faithfully to ob&s;erve his in|junctions.</P>
<P>He then left the villa, meditating on the circum|&s;tances he had ju&s;t learned, and on the prophetic a&s;&s;er|tion of the monk, between whom, and the cau&s;e of Bianchi's &s;udden death, he could not forbear &s;urmi&s;ing there was &s;ome connection, and it now occurred to him, and for the fir&s;t time, that this monk, this my&s;te|rious &s;tranger, was no other than Schedoni, whom he had ob&s;erved of late going more frequently than u&s;ual, to his mother's apartment. He almo&s;t &s;tarted, in hor|ror of the &s;u&s;picion, to which this conjecture led, and precipitately rejected it, as a poi&s;on that would de&s;troy his own peace for ever. But though he in&s;tantly di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed the &s;u&s;picion, the conjecture returned to his mind, and he endeavoured to recollect the voice and figure of the &s;tranger, that he might compare them with tho&s;e of the confe&s;&s;or. The voices were, he thought, of a different tone, and the per&s;ons of a dif|ferent height and proportion. This compari&s;on, however, did not forbid him to &s;urmi&s;e that the &s;tran|ger was an agent of the confe&s;&s;or's; that he was, at lea&s;t, a &s;ecret &s;py upon his actions, and the defamer of Ellena; while both, if indeed there were two per&s;ons concerned, appeared to be at the command of his pa|rents. Fired with indignation of the unworthy arts that he believed to have been employed again&s;t him, and impatient to meet the &s;landerer of Ellena, he de|termined to attempt &s;ome deci&s;ive &s;tep towards a di&s;|covery
<PB N="68" REF="032735_0066_0FF493C302976BF0">
of the truth, and either to compel the confe&s;&s;or to reveal it to him, or to &s;earch out his agent, who, he fancied, was occa&s;ionally a re&s;ident within the ruins of Paluzzi.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the convent, which Beatrice had pointed out, did not e&s;cape his con&s;ideration, but no rea&s;on appeared for &s;uppo&s;ing them the enemies of his Ellena, who, on the contrary, he under&s;tood had been for &s;ome years amicably connected with them. The embroidered &s;ilks, of which the old &s;ervant had &s;poken, &s;ufficiently explained the nature of the con|nection, and di&s;covering more fully the circum|&s;tances of Ellena's fortune, her conduct heightened the tender admiration with which he had hitherto regarded her.</P>
<P>The hints for &s;u&s;picion which Beatrice had given re&s;pecting the cau&s;e of her mi&s;tre&s;s's decea&s;e, ince&s;|&s;antly recurred to him; and it appeared extraordinary, and &s;ometimes in the highe&s;t degree improbable, that any per&s;on could be &s;ufficiently intere&s;ted in the death of a woman apparently &s;o blamele&s;s, as to admini&s;ter p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;on to her. What motive could have prompted &s;o horrible a deed, was &s;till more inexplicable. It was true that &s;he had long been in a declining &s;tate; yet the &s;uddenne&s;s of her departure and the &s;ingula|rity of &s;ome circum&s;tances preceding as well as &s;ome appearances that had followed it, compelled Vivaldi to doubt as to the cau&s;e. He believed, however, that, after having &s;een the corp&s;e, his doubts mu&s;t vani&s;h; and Beatrice had promi&s;ed, that, if he could return in the evening, when Ellena had retired to re&s;t, he &s;hould be permitted to vi&s;it the chamber of the decea&s;ed. There was &s;omething repugnant to his feelings, in going thus &s;ecretly, or, indeed, at all, to the re&s;idence of Ellena at this delicate period, yet it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould introduce there &s;ome medical profe&s;&s;or, on who&s;e judgment he could re&s;t,
<PB N="69" REF="032735_0067_0FF4942A8A298060">
re&s;pecting the occa&s;ion of Bianchi's death; and as he believed he &s;hould &s;oon acquire the right of vindi|cating the honour of Ellena, that con&s;ideration did not &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly affect him as otherwi&s;e it would have done. The enquiry which called him thither was, be&s;ides, of a nature too &s;olemn and important to be lightly re&s;igned; he had therefore, told Beatrice he would be punctual to the hour &s;he appointed. His intention to &s;earch for the monk was thus again interrupted.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN Vivaldi returned to Naples, he enquir|ed for the Marche&s;a, of whom he wi&s;hed to a&s;k &s;ome que&s;tions concerning Schedoni, which, though he &s;carcely expected they would be explicitly an&s;wered, might yet lead to part of the truth he &s;ought for.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a was in her clo&s;et, and Vivaldi found the confe&s;&s;or with her. "This man cro&s;&s;es me like my evil genius," &s;aid he to him&s;elf as he entered, "but I will know whether he de&s;erves my &s;u&s;picions before I leave the room."</P>
<P>Schedoni was &s;o deeply engaged in conver&s;ation, that he did not immediately perceive Vivaldi, who &s;tood for a moment examining his countenance, and tracing &s;ubjects for curio&s;ity in its deep lines. His eyes, while he &s;poke were ca&s;t downward, and his fea|tures were fixed in an expre&s;&s;ion at once &s;evere and crafty. The Marche&s;a was li&s;tening with deep at|tention, her head inclined towards him, as if to catch the lowe&s;t murmur of his voice, and her face picturing the anxiety and vexation of her mind. This was evidently a conference, not a confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Vivaldi advancing, the monk rai&s;ed his eyes; his countenance &s;uffered no change, as they met tho&s;e of Vivaldi. He ro&s;e, but did not take leave, and return|ed the &s;light and &s;omewhat haughty &s;alutation of Vi|valdi, with an inclination of the head, that indicated&punc; pride without petti&s;hne&s;s, and a firmne&s;s bordering o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> contempt.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a, on perceiving her &s;on was &s;omewhat embarra&s;&s;ed, and her brow, before &s;lightly contracted
<PB N="71" REF="032735_0069_0FF4942C11E15CB0">
by vexation, now frowned with &s;everity. Yet it was an involuntary emotion, for &s;he endeavoured to cha&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of it with a &s;mile. Vivaldi liked the &s;mile &s;till le&s;s than the frown.</P>
<P>Schedoni &s;eated him&s;elf quietly, and began with al|mo&s;t the ea&s;e of a man of the world, to conver&s;e on general topics. Vivaldi, however, was re&s;erved and &s;i|lent; he knew not how to begin a conver&s;ation, which might lead to the knowledge he de&s;ired, and the Mar|che&s;a did not relieve him from the difficulty. His eye and his ear a&s;&s;i&s;ted him at lea&s;t to conjecture at lea&s;t, if not to obtain the information he wi&s;hed; and, as he li&s;tened to the deep tones of Schedoni's voice, he be|came almo&s;t certain, that they were not the accents of his unknown advi&s;er, though he con&s;idered, at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame moment, that it was not difficult to di&s;gui&s;e, or to feign a voice. His &s;tature &s;eemed to decide the que&s;tion more rea&s;onably; for the figure of Schedoni appeared taller than that of the &s;tranger; and tho' there was &s;omething of re&s;emblance in their air, which Vi|valdi had never ob&s;erved before, he again con&s;idered, that the habit of the &s;ame order, which each wore, might ea&s;ily occa&s;ion an artificial re&s;emblance. Or the likene&s;s, as to countenance, he could not judge, &s;ince the &s;tranger had been &s;o much &s;hrouded by his cowl, that Vivaldi had never di&s;tinctly &s;een a &s;ingle feature. Schedoni's hood was now thrown back, &s;o that he could not compare even the air of their heads under &s;imilar circum&s;tances; but as he remembered to have &s;een the confe&s;&s;or on a former day approach|ing his mother's clo&s;et with the cowl &s;hading his face, the &s;ame gloomy &s;everity &s;eemed to characterize both, and nearly the &s;ame terrible portrait was drawn on his fancy. Yet this again might be only an artificial effect, a character which the cowl alone gave to the head; and any face &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en imperfectly beneath its dark &s;hade, might have appeared equally &s;evere. Vivaldi was
<PB N="72" REF="032735_0070_0FF493CECF249A28">
&s;till extremely perplexed in his opinion. One cir|cum&s;tance, however &s;eemed to throw &s;ome light on his judgment. The &s;tranger had appeared in the ha|bit of a monk, and if Vivaldi's tran&s;ient ob&s;ervation might be tru&s;ted, he was of the very &s;ame order with that of Schedoni, Yet if he were Schedoni, or even his agent, it was not probable that he would have &s;hewn him&s;elf in a dre&s;s that might lead to a di&s;covery of his per&s;on. That he was anxious for a conceal|ment, his manner had &s;trongly proved; it &s;eemed then, that this habit of a monk was only a di&s;gui&s;e, a&s;&s;umed for the purpo&s;e of mi&s;leading conjecture. Vivaldi, however, determined to put &s;ome que&s;tions to Sche|doni, and at the &s;ame time to ob&s;erve their effect on his countenance. He took occa&s;ion to notice &s;ome drawing of ruins, which ornamented the cabinet of the Marche&s;a, and to &s;ay that the fortre&s;s of Paluzzi was worthy of being added to her collection. "You have &s;een it lately, perhaps, reverend father," added Vivaldi, with a penetrating glance.</P>
<P>"It is a &s;triking relique of antiquity," replied the confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"That arch," re&s;umed Vivaldi, his eye &s;till fixed on Schedoni, "that arch &s;u&s;pended between two rocks, the one overtopped by the towers of the fortre&s;s, the other &s;hadowed with pine and broad oak, has a fine effect. But a picture of it would want human figures Now either the grote&s;que &s;hapes of banditti lurking within the ruin, as if ready to &s;tart out upon the tra|veller, or a friar rolled up in his black garments, ju&s;t &s;tealing forth from under the &s;hade of the arch, and looking like &s;ome &s;upernatural me&s;&s;enger of evil would fini&s;h the piece."</P>
<P>The features of Schedoni &s;uffered no change dur|ing this &s;peech. "Your picture in complete," &s;aid he, "and I cannot but admire the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ecility with which you have cla&s;&s;ed the monks together with banditti."</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="032735_0071_0FF4942D9AB17F00">
"Your pardon, holy father," &s;aid Vivaldi, "I did not draw a parallel between them."</P>
<P>"O! no offence, Signor," replied Schedoni, with a &s;mile &s;omewhat gha&s;tly.</P>
<P>During the latter part of this conver&s;ation, if con|ver&s;ation it may be called, the Marche&s;a had followed a &s;ervant, who had brought her a letter, out of the a|partment, and as the confe&s;&s;or appeared to await her re|turn, Vivaldi determined to pre&s;s his enquiry. "It ap|pears, however," &s;aid he, "that Paluzzi, if not haunt|ed by robbers, is at lea&s;t frequented by eccle&s;ia&s;tics; for I have &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed it without &s;eeing one of the order, and that one has appeared &s;o &s;uddenly, and va|ni&s;hed &s;o &s;uddenly, that I have been almo&s;t compelled to believe he was literally a &s;piritual being!"</P>
<P>"The convent of the Black Penitents is not far di&s;tant," ob&s;erved the confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"Does the dre&s;s of this convent re&s;emble that of your order, reverend father? for I ob&s;erved that the monk I &s;peak of was habited like your&s;elf; aye and he was about your &s;tature, and very much re&s;embled you."</P>
<P>"That well may be, Signor," replied the confe&s;|&s;or calmly; "there are many brethern who, no doubt, re&s;emble each other; but the brothers of the Black Penitents are clothed in &s;ackcloth; and the death's head on the garment, the peculiar &s;ymbol of this or|der, would not have e&s;caped your ob&s;ervation; it could not, therefore, be a member of their &s;ociety whom you have &s;een."</P>
<P>"I am not inclined to think that it was," &s;aid Vi|valdi; "but be it who it may, I hope &s;oon to be better acquainted with him, and to tell him truths &s;o &s;trong, that he &s;hall not be permitted even to affect the mi&s;un|der&s;tanding of them."</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="032735_0072_0FF493D057DA00B8">
"You will do right, if you have cau&s;e of complaint again&s;t him," ob&s;erved Schedoni.</P>
<P>"And only if I have cau&s;e of complaint, holy father? Are &s;trong truths to be told only when there is direct cau&s;e of complaint? Is it only when we are injured that we are to be &s;incere?" He believed that he had now detected Schedoni, who &s;eemed to have betrayed a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that Vivaldi had rea&s;on for complaint again&s;t the &s;tranger.</P>
<P>"You will ob&s;erve, reverend father, that I have not &s;aid I am injured," he added. "If you know that I am, this mu&s;t be by other means than by my words: I have not even expre&s;&s;ed re&s;entment."</P>
<P>"Except by your voice and eye, Signor," replied Schedoni drily. "When a man is vehement and di&s;|ordered, we u&s;ually are inclined to &s;uppo&s;e he feels re&s;entment, and that he has cau&s;e of complaint, either real or imaginary. As I have not the honour of be|ing acquainted with the &s;ubject you allude to, I cannot decide to which of the two your cau&s;e belongs."</P>
<P>"I have never been in doubt as to that," &s;aid Vi|valdi haughtily; "and if I had, you will pardon me, holy father, but I &s;hould not have reque&s;ted your de|ci&s;ion. My injuries are, alas! too real; and I now think it is al&s;o too certain to whom I may attribute them. The &s;ecret advi&s;er, who &s;teals into the bo&s;om of a family only to poi&s;on its repo&s;e, the informer&mdash;the ba&s;e a&s;per&s;er of innocence, &s;tand revealed in one per&s;on before me.</P>
<P>Vivaldi delivered the&s;e words with a tempered ener|gy, at once dignified and pointed, which &s;eemed to &s;trike directly to the heart of Schedoni; but, whether it was his con&s;cience or his pride that took the alarm, did not certainly appear. Vivaldi believed the for|mer. A dark malignity over&s;pread the features of the monk, and at that moment Vivaldi thought he beheld a man, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions might impel him to the perpe|tration
<PB N="75" REF="032735_0073_0FF4943007CC0090">
of almo&s;t any crime, how hideous &s;oever. He recoiled from him, as if he had &s;uddenly &s;een a &s;erpent in his path, and &s;tood gazing on his face, with an at|tention &s;o wholly occupied as to be uncon&s;cious that he did &s;o.</P>
<P>Schedoni almo&s;t in&s;tantly recovered him&s;elf; his features relaxed from their fir&s;t expre&s;&s;ion, and that portentous darkne&s;s pa&s;&s;ed away from his countenance; but with a look that was &s;till &s;tern and haughty, he &s;aid, "Signor, however ignorant I may be of the &s;ub|ject of your di&s;content, I cannot mi&s;under&s;tand that your re&s;entment is, to &s;ome extent or other, directed again&s;t my&s;elf as the cau&s;e of it. Yet I will not &s;up|po&s;e, Signor; I &s;ay I will not &s;uppo&s;e," rai&s;ing his voice &s;ignificantly, "that you have dared to brand me with the ignominious titles you have ju&s;t uttered; but"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I have applied them to the author of my injuries," interrupted Vivaldi; "you, father, can be&s;t inform me whether they applied to your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"I have then nothing to complain of," &s;aid Sche|doni, adroitly, and with a &s;udden calmne&s;s, that &s;ur|pri&s;ed Vivaldi. "If you directed them again&s;t the author of your injuries, whatever they may be, I am &s;atisfied."</P>
<P>The chearful complacency, with which he &s;poke this, renewed the doubts of Vivaldi, who thought it nearly impo&s;&s;ible that a man con&s;cious of guilt could a&s;&s;ume, under the very charge of it, the tranquil and dignified air which the confe&s;&s;or now di&s;played. He began to accu&s;e him&s;elf of having condemned him with pa&s;&s;ionate ra&s;hne&s;s, and gradually became &s;hock|ed at the indecorum of his conduct towards a man of Schedoni's age and &s;acred profe&s;&s;ion. Tho&s;e expre&s;|&s;ions of countenance, which had &s;o much alarmed him, he was now inclined to think the effects of a jealous and haughty honour, and he almo&s;t forgot the malig|nity, which had mingled with Schedoni's pride, in
<PB N="76" REF="032735_0074_0FF493D1E0432BA8">
&s;orrow for the offence that had provoked it. Thus, not le&s;s precipitate in his pity than his anger, and cre|dulous alike to the pa&s;&s;ion of the moment, he was now as eager to apologize for his error, as he had been ha&s;ty in committing it. The frankne&s;s, with which he apologized and lamented the impropriety of his conduct would have won an ea&s;y forgivene&s;s from a generous heart. Schedoni li&s;tened with apparent complacency and &s;ecret contempt. He regarded Vi|valdi as a ra&s;h boy, who was &s;wayed only by his pa&s;|&s;ions; but while he &s;uffered deep re&s;entment for the evil in his character, he felt neither re&s;pect nor kind|ne&s;s for the good, for the &s;incerity, the love of ju&s;tice, the genero&s;ity, which threw a brilliancy even on his foibles. Schedoni, indeed, &s;aw only evil in human nature.</P>
<P>Had the heart of Vivaldi been le&s;s generous, he would now have di&s;tru&s;ted the &s;atisfaction, which the confe&s;&s;or a&s;&s;umed, and have di&s;covered the contempt and malignity, that lurked behind the &s;mile thus im|perfectly ma&s;king his countenance. The confe&s;&s;or perceived his power, and the character of Vivaldi lay before him as a map. He &s;aw, or fancied he &s;aw every line and feature of its plan, and the relative propor|tions of every energy and weakne&s;s of its nature. He believed, al&s;o, he could turn the very virtues of this young man again&s;t him&s;elf, and he exulted, even while the &s;mile of good-will was yet upon his countenance, in anticipating the moment that &s;hould avenge him for the pa&s;t outrage, and which, while Vivaldi was ingenuou&s;ly lamenting it, he had apparantly for|gotten.</P>
<P>Schedoni was thus ruminating evil again&s;t Vivaldi, and Vivaldi was con&s;idering how he might po&s;&s;ibly make Schedoni atonement for the affront he had offer|ed him, when the Marche&s;a returned to the apart|ment; and perceived in the hone&s;t countenance of
<PB N="77" REF="032735_0075_0FF494387463E938">
Vivaldi &s;ome &s;ymptoms of the agitation which had pa&s;&s;ed over it; his complexion was flu&s;hed, and his brow was &s;lightly contracted. The face of Schedoni told nothing but complacency, except that now and then when he looked at Vivaldi, it was with half &s;hut eyes, that indicated treachery, or, at lea&s;t, cunning, try|ing to conceal exa&s;perated pride.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a, with di&s;plea&s;ure directed again&s;t her &s;on, enquired the rea&s;on of his emotion; but he, &s;tung with con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his conduct towards the monk, could neither endure to explain it, or to remain in her pre&s;ence, and &s;aying that he would confide his honour to the di&s;cretion of the holy father, who would &s;peak only too favourably of his fault, he abruptly left the room.</P>
<P>When he had departed, Schedoni gave, with &s;eem|ing reluctance, the explanation which the Marche&s;a required, but was cautious not to &s;peak too favourably of Vivaldi's conduct, which, on the contrary, he re|pre&s;ented as much more in&s;ulting than it really was; and, while he aggravated the offen&s;ive part of it, he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all mention of the candour and &s;elf-reproach, which had followed the charge. Yet this he managed &s;o artfully that he appeared to extenuate Vivaldi's er|rors, to lament the ha&s;tine&s;s of his temper, and to plead for a forgivene&s;s from his irritated mother. "He is very young," added the monk, when he perceived that he had &s;ufficiently exa&s;perated the Marche&s;a again&s;t her &s;on; "he is very young, and youth is warm in its pa&s;&s;ions and precipitate in its judgments. He was, be&s;ides, jealous, no doubt, of the friend&s;hip with which you are plea&s;ed to honour me; and it is natural that a &s;on &s;hould be jealous of the attention of &s;uch a mother."</P>
<P>"You are too good, father," &s;aid the Marche&s;a; her re&s;entment encrea&s;ing towards Vivaldi in propor|tion as Schedoni di&s;played his artificial candour and meekne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="032735_0076_0FF493DCCF03C7D0">
"It is true," continued the confe&s;&s;or, "that I per|ceive all the inconveniences to which my attachment, I &s;hould &s;ay my duty, to your family expo&s;es me; but I willingly &s;ubmit to the&s;e, while it is yet po&s;&s;ible that my advice may be a means of pre&s;erving the honour of your hou&s;e un&s;ullied, and of &s;aving this incon&s;iderate young man from future mi&s;ery and unavailing re|pentance."</P>
<P>During the warmth of this &s;ympathy in re&s;entment, the Marche&s;a and Schedoni mutually, and &s;incerely, lo&s;t their remembrance of the unworthy motives, by which each knew the other to be influenced, as well as that di&s;gu&s;t which tho&s;e who act together to the &s;ame bad end, can &s;eldom e&s;cape from feeling towards their a&s;&s;ociates. The Marche&s;a, while &s;he commend|ed the fidelity of Schedoni, forgot his views and her promi&s;es as to a rich benefice; while the confe&s;&s;or im|puted her anxiety for the &s;plendor of her &s;on's condi|tion to a real intere&s;t in his welfare, not a care of her own dignity. After mutual compliments had been exchanged, they proceeded to a long con&s;ultation con|cerning Vivaldi, and it was agreed, that their efforts for what they termed his pre&s;ervation &s;hould no longer be confined to remon&s;trances.</P>

<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>VIVALDI, when his fir&s;t feelings of pity and compunction for having in&s;ulted an aged man, the member of a &s;acred profe&s;&s;ion, were pa&s;t, and when he looked with a more deliberate eye upon &s;ome circum|&s;tances of the confe&s;&s;or's conduct, perceived that &s;u&s;pi|cion was again gathering on his mind. But, regard|ing this as a &s;ymptom of his own weakne&s;s, rather than as a hint of truth, he endeavoured, with a magnani|mous di&s;dain, to reject every &s;urmi&s;e that boded un|favourably of Schedoni.</P>
<P>When evening arrived, he ha&s;tened towards the villa Altieri, and, having met without the city, accord|ing to appointment, a phy&s;ician, upon who&s;e honour and judgment he thought he might rely, they proceed|ed on their way together. Vivaldi had forgotten, during the confu&s;ion of his la&s;t interview with Ellena, to deliver up the key of the garden-gate, and he now entered it as u&s;ual, though he could not entirely over|come the reluctance, which he felt on thus vi&s;iting, in &s;ecret and at night, the dwelling of Ellena. Un|der no other circum&s;tances, however, could the phy&s;i|cian, who&s;e opinion was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to his peace, be introduced without betraying a &s;u&s;picion, which mu&s;t render her unhappy, probably for ever.</P>
<P>Beatrice, who had watched for them in the portico, led the way to the chamber where the corp&s;e was laid out; and Vivaldi, though con&s;iderably affected when he entered, &s;oon recovered compo&s;ure enough to take his &s;tation on one &s;ide of the bed, while the phy&s;ician placed him&s;elf on the other. Unwilling to expo&s;e his
<PB N="80" REF="032735_0078_0FF493DE54954598">
emotion to the ob&s;ervation of a &s;ervant, and de&s;irous al&s;o of &s;ome private conver&s;ation with the phy&s;ician, he took the lamp from Beatrice and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her.&mdash;As the light glared upon the livid face of the corp&s;e, Vivaldi gazed with melancholy &s;urpri&s;e, and an effort of rea&s;on was nece&s;&s;ary to convince him, that this was the &s;ame countenance which only one evening preced|ing was animated like his own; which had looked upon him in tears, while, with anxiety the mo&s;t tender, &s;he had committed the happine&s;s of her niece to his care, and had, alas! too ju&s;tly predicted her ap|proaching di&s;&s;olution. The circum&s;tances of that &s;cene now appeared to him like a vi&s;ion, and touched every fibre of his heart. He was fully &s;en&s;ible of the importance of the tru&s;t committed to him, and, as he now hung over the pale and de&s;erted form of Bianchi, he &s;ilently renewed his &s;olemn vows to Ellena, to de|&s;erve the confidence of her departed guardian.</P>
<P>Before Vivaldi had courage enough to a&s;k the opi|nion of the phy&s;ician, who was &s;till viewing the face of the decea&s;ed with very earne&s;t attention and di&s;ap|proving countenance, his own &s;u&s;picions &s;trengthened from &s;ome circum&s;tances of her appearance; and par|ticularly from the black tint that prevailed over her complexion, it &s;eemed to him, that her death had been by poi&s;on. He &s;eared to break a &s;ilence, which pro|longed his hope of the contrary, feeble though it was; and the phy&s;ician, who probably was apprehen&s;ive for the con&s;equence of delivering his real thoughts, did not &s;peak.</P>
<P>"<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> read your opinion," &s;aid Vivaldi, at length, "it coincides with my own."</P>
<P>"I know not as to that, Signor," replied the phy|&s;ician, "though I think I perceive what is yours. Appearances are unfavourable, yet I will not take up|on me to decide from them, that it is as you &s;u&s;pect. There are other circum&s;tances, under which &s;imilar
<PB N="81" REF="032735_0079_0FF4943B89CBFAF8">
appearances might occur." He gave his rea&s;ons for this a&s;&s;ertion, which were plau&s;ible even to Vivaldi, and concluded with reque&s;ting to &s;peak with Beatrice, "for I wi&s;h to under&s;tand," &s;aid he, "what was the exact &s;ituation of this lady for &s;ome hours previous to her decea&s;e."</P>
<P>After a cover&s;ation of &s;ome length with Beatrice, whatever might be the opinion re&s;ulting from his en|quiries, he adhered nearly to his former a&s;&s;ertions; pronouncing that &s;o many contradictory circum&s;tances appeared, as rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for him to decide, whether Bianchi had died by poi&s;on, or otherwi&s;e. He &s;tated more fully than he had done before the rea&s;ons which mu&s;t render the opinion of any medical per&s;on, on this &s;ubject, doubtful. But, whether it was that he feared to be re&s;pon&s;ible for a deci&s;ion, which would accu&s;e &s;ome per&s;on of murder, or that he really was inclined to believe that Bianchi died naturally, it is certain he &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to adopt the latter opinion; and that he was very anxious to quiet the &s;u&s;picions of Vivaldi. He &s;o far &s;ucceeded, indeed, as to convince him that it would be unavailing to pur&s;ue the enquiry, and almo&s;t compelled him to believe, that &s;he had de|parted according to the common cour&s;e of nature.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, having lingered a while over the death-bed of Bianchi, and taken a la&s;t farewell of her &s;ilent form, quitted the chamber and the hou&s;e as &s;oftly as he had approached, and unob&s;erved, as he believed, by Ellena or any other per&s;on. The morning dawned over the &s;ea, when he returned into the garden, and a few fi&s;h|ermen, loitering on the beach, or putting off their little boats from the &s;hore, were the only per&s;ons vi&s;ible at this early hour. The time, however, was pa&s;&s;ed for renewing the enquiry he had purpo&s;ed at Paluzzi, and the brightening dawn warned him to retire. To Naples, therefore, he returned, with &s;pirits &s;omewhat
<PB N="82" REF="032735_0080_0FF493DFDBCF5AB0">
&s;oothed by a hope, that Bianchi had not fallen prema|turely, and by the certainty that Ellena was well. On the way thither, he pa&s;&s;ed the fort without interrup|tion, and, having parted with the phy&s;ician, was ad|mitted into his father's man&s;ion by a confidential &s;ervant.</P>

<P>ELLENA, on thus &s;uddenly lo&s;ing her aunt, her only relative, the friend of her whole life, felt as if left alone in the world. But it was not in the fir&s;t moment of affliction that this feeling occurred. Her own for|lorn &s;ituation was not even ob&s;erved, while affection, pity, and irre&s;i&s;tible grief for Bianchi, occupied her heart.</P>
<P>Bianchi was to be interred in the church belonging to the convent of Santa Maria della Pieta. The body attired according to the cu&s;tom of the country, and decorated with flowers, was carried on an open bier to the place of interment, attended only by prie&s;ts and torch-bearers. But Ellena could not endure thus lightly to part with the reliques of a beloved friend, and being re&s;trained by cu&s;tom from following the corp&s;e to the grave, &s;he repaired fir&s;t to the convent, to attend the funeral &s;ervice. Her &s;orrow did not al|low her to join in the choral &s;ymphonies of the nuns, but their &s;acred &s;olemnity was &s;oothing to her &s;pirits, and the tears &s;he &s;hed while &s;he li&s;tened to the length|ening notes, a&s;&s;uaged the force of grief.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervice concluded &s;he withdrew to the parlour of the lady Abbe&s;s, who mingled with her con&s;olations many entreaties that Ellena would make the convent her pre&s;ent a&s;ylum; and her affliction re|quired little per&s;ua&s;ion on this &s;ubject. It was her wi&s;h to retire hither as to a &s;anctuary, which was not only &s;uitable to her particular circum&s;tances, but e&s;pe|cially adapted to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her &s;pirits. Here
<PB N="84" REF="032735_0082_0FF493E160CB4B50">
&s;he believed that &s;he &s;hould &s;ooner acquire re&s;ignation and regain tranquility, than in a place le&s;s con&s;ecrated to religion; and, before &s;he took leave of the Abbe&s;s it was agreed, that &s;he &s;hould be received as a boarder. To acquaint Vivaldi with her intention was, indeed, her chief motive for returning to the villa Altieri, after this her re&s;olution had been taken. Her affection and e&s;teem had been gradual in their progre&s;s, and had now attained a degree of &s;trength, which promi&s;ed to de|cide the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of her whole life. The fanction given by her aunt to this choice, and particu|larly the very &s;olemn manner in which, on the even|ing preceding her death, &s;he bequeathed Ellena to his care, had &s;till endeared him to her heart, and imparted a &s;acredne&s;s to the engagement, which made her con|&s;ider Vivaldi as her guardian and only &s;urviving pro|tector. The more tenderly &s;he lamented her decea&s;ed relative, the more tenderly &s;he thought of Vivaldi; and her love for the one was &s;o intimately connected with her affection for the other, that each &s;eemed &s;trengthened and exalted by the union.</P>
<P>When the funeral was over, they met at Altieri.</P>
<P>He was neither &s;urpri&s;ed nor aver&s;e to her with|drawing awhile to a convert; for there was a propri|ety in retiring, during the period of her grief, from&punc; home where &s;he had no longer a guardian, which de|licacy &s;eemed to demand. He only &s;tipulated that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> might be permitted to vi&s;it her in the parlour of the convent, and to claim, when decorum &s;hould no longer object to it, the hand which Bianchi had re&s;igned to him.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding that he yielded to this arrange|ment without complaining, it was not entirely without repining; but being a&s;&s;ured by Ellena of the worthi|ne&s;s of the Abbe&s;s of the Santa Maria della Pieta, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> endeavoured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ilence the &s;ecret murmurs of his heart with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of his judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="032735_0083_0FF494451A6508C8">
Mean while, the deep impre&s;&s;ion made by his un|known tormentor, the monk, and e&s;pecially by his pre|diction of the death of Bianchi, remained upon his mind, and he once more determined to a&s;certain, if po&s;|&s;ible, the true nature of this portentous vi&s;itant, and what were the motives which induced him to haunt his foot&s;teps and interrupt his peace. He was awed by the circum&s;tances which had attended the vi&s;itations of the monk, if monk it was; by the &s;uddenne&s;s of his appearance, and departure; by the truth of his pro|phecies; and, above all, by the &s;olemn event which had verified his la&s;t warning; and his imagination, thus elevated by wonder and painful curio&s;ity, was prepar|ed for &s;omething above the reach of common conjec|ture, and beyond the accompli&s;hment of human agen|cy. His under&s;tanding was&punc; &s;ufficiently clear and &s;trong to teach him to detect many errors of opinion, that prevailed around him, as well as to di&s;pi&s;e the common &s;uper&s;titions of his country, and, in the u&s;ual &s;tate of his mind, he probably would not have pau&s;ed for a moment on the &s;ubject before him; but his pa&s;|&s;ions were now intere&s;ted and his fancy awakened, and, though he was uncon&s;cious of this propen&s;ity, he would, perhaps, have been &s;omewhat di&s;appointed to have de&s;cended &s;uddenly from the region of fearful &s;ublimity, to which he had &s;oared&mdash;to the world of terrible &s;hadows&mdash;to the earth, on which he daily walked, and to an explanation &s;imply natural.</P>
<P>He de&s;igned to vi&s;it again, at midnight, the fortre&s;s of Paluzzi, and not to watch for the appearance of the &s;tranger, but to carry torches into every rece&s;s of the ruin, and di&s;cover, at lea&s;t, whether it was haunted by any other human beings than him&s;elf. The chief difficul|ty which had hitherto delayed him, was that of finding a per&s;on, in whom he could confide, to accompany him in the &s;earch, &s;ince his former adventure had warned him never to renew it alone. Signor Bonarmo per|&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="86" REF="032735_0084_0FF493ECC2D94368">
ab&s;olutely, and, perhaps, wi&s;ely, to refu&s;e his reque&s;t on this &s;ubject; and, as Vivaldi had no other acquaintance, to whom he cho&s;e to give &s;o much ex|planation of the affair as might induce compliance, he at length determined to take with him Paulo, his own &s;ervant.</P>
<P>On the Evening, previous to the day of Ellena's departure to the Santo della Pieta, Vivaldi went to Altieri, to bid her adieu. During this interview his &s;pirits were more than u&s;ually depre&s;&s;ed; and, though he knew that her retirement was only for a &s;hort period, and had as much confidence in the con|tinuance of her affection, as is, perhaps, po&s;&s;ible to a lover, Vivaldi felt as if he was parting with her for ever. A thou&s;and vague and fearful conjectures, &s;uch as he never till this moment admitted, a&s;&s;ailed him, and among&s;t them, it appeared probable, that the arts of the nuns might win her from the world, and &s;acri|fice her to the cloi&s;ter. In her pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;orrow this &s;eemed to be even more than probable, and not all the a&s;&s;urances which Ellena gave him, and in the&s;e parting moments &s;he &s;poke with le&s;s re&s;erve than &s;he had hitherto done, could entirely re-a&s;&s;ure his mind. "It &s;hould &s;eem, Ellena, by the&s;e boding fears," &s;aid he, imprudently, "that I am parting with you for e|ver; I feel a weight upon my heart, which I cannot throw off. Yet I con&s;ent that you &s;hall withdraw awhile to this convent, convinced of the propriety of the &s;tep; and I ought, al&s;o, to know that you will &s;oon return; that I &s;hall &s;oon take you from its walls as my wife, never more to leave me, never more to pa&s;s from my immediate care and tenderne&s;s. I ought to feel a&s;&s;ured of all this; yet &s;o apt are my fears, that I cannot confide in what is probable, but rather ap|prehend what is po&s;&s;ible. And is it then po&s;&s;ible that I yet may lo&s;e you, and is it only probable that you may be mine for ever? How under &s;uch circum&s;tan|ces,
<PB N="87" REF="032735_0085_0FF49446A3095858">
could I weakly con&s;ent to your retirement? Why did I not urge you to be&s;tow immediately tho&s;e in|di&s;&s;oluble bonds, which no human force can bur&s;t a&s;un|der? How could I leave the de&s;tiny of all my peace within the reach of a po&s;&s;ibility, which it was once in my power to have removed! Which it was in my power!&mdash;It is, perhaps, &s;till in my power. O Elle|na! let the &s;everities of cu&s;tom yield to the &s;ecurity of my happine&s;s. If you do go to the Santa Maria, let it be only to vi&s;it its altar!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi delivered this expo&s;tulation with a rapidity, that left no pau&s;e for Ellena to interrupt him. When, at length, he concluded, &s;he gently reproached him for doubting the continuance of her regard, and endea|voured to &s;ooth his apprehen&s;ions of misforune, but would not li&s;ten to his reque&s;t. She repre&s;ented, that not only the &s;tate of her &s;pirits required retire|ment, but that re&s;pect to the memory of her aunt de|manded it; and added gravely, that if he had &s;o little confidence in the &s;teadine&s;s of her opinions, as to doubt the con&s;tancy of her affection, and for &s;o &s;hort a peri|od, unle&s;s her vows were &s;ecured to him, he had done imprudently to elect her for the companion of his whole life.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, then a&s;hamed of the weakne&s;s he had be|trayed, be&s;ought her forgivene&s;s, and endeavoured to appea&s;e apprehen&s;ions which pa&s;&s;ion only made plau|&s;ible, and which rea&s;on reproved; notwith&s;tanding which, he could recover neither tranquility nor con|fidence; nor could Ellena, though her conduct was &s;upported and encouraged by ju&s;tne&s;s of &s;entiment, en|tirely remove the oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits &s;he had felt from almo&s;t the fir&s;t moment of this interview. They parted with many tears; and Vivaldi, before he final|ly took his leave, frequently returned to claim &s;ome promi&s;e, or to a&s;certain &s;ome explanation, till Ellena remarked with a forced &s;mile, that the &s;ere&s;embled e|ternal
<PB N="88" REF="032735_0086_0FF493EE49A97708">
adieus, rather than tho&s;e of only a few days; an ob&s;ervation which renewed all his alarm, and furni&s;hed an excu&s;e for again delaying his departure. At length he tore him&s;elf away, and left the villa Altieri; but as the time was yet too early to &s;uit his purpo&s;ed en|quiry at Paluzzi, he returned to Naples.</P>
<P>Ellena, meanwhile, endeavouring to di&s;&s;ipate me|lancholy recollections by employment, continued bu|&s;ied in preparation for her departure on the following day, till a late hour of the night. In the pro&s;pect of quitting, though only for &s;o &s;hort a period, the home where &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed almo&s;t every day &s;ince the dawn of her earlie&s;t remembrance, there was &s;omething mel|ancholy, if not &s;olemn in leaving tho&s;e well-known &s;cenes, where, it might be &s;aid, the &s;hade of her de|cea&s;ed relative &s;eemed yet to linger, &s;he was quitting all ve&s;tige of her late happine&s;s, all note of former years and pre&s;ent con&s;olation; and &s;he felt as if going forth into a new and homele&s;s world. Her affection for the place encrea&s;ed as the pa&s;&s;ing time dimini&s;hed, and it &s;eemed as if the la&s;t moment of her &s;tay would be preci&s;ely that, in which the villa Altieri would be mo&s;t valued.</P>
<P>In her favourite apartments &s;he lingered for a con|&s;iderable time; and in the room where &s;he had &s;upped on the night immediately preceding the death of Sig|nora Bianchi, &s;he indulged many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ender and mournful recollections, and probably would have continued to indulge them much longer, had not her attention been withdrawn by a &s;udden ru&s;tling of the foliage that &s;ur|rounded the window, when on rai&s;ing her eyes, &s;he thought &s;he perceived &s;ome per&s;on pa&s;s quickly before it. The lattices had, as u&s;ual, been left open to admit the fre&s;h breeze from the bay below, but &s;he now ro&s;e with &s;ome alarm to clo&s;e them, and had &s;carcely done &s;o when &s;he heard a di&s;tant knocking from the portico,
<PB N="89" REF="032735_0087_0FF494482D2A2628">
and in the next in&s;tant the &s;creams of Beatrice in the hall.</P>
<P>Alarmed for her&s;elf, Ellena, had, however, the cou|rage to advance to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her old &s;ervant, when, on entering the pa&s;&s;age leading to the hall, three men, ma&s;ked and muffled up in cloaks, appeared, ad|vancing from the oppo&s;ite extremity. While &s;he fled, they pur&s;ued her to the apartment &s;he had quit|ted. Her breath and her courage were gone, yet &s;he &s;truggled to &s;u&s;tain her&s;elf, and endeavoured to a&s;k with calmne&s;s what was their errand. They gave no reply, but threw a veil over her face, and &s;eizing her arms, led her almo&s;t unre&s;i&s;ting but &s;upplicating, to|wards the portico.</P>
<P>In the hall, Ellena perceived Beatrice bound to a pillar; and another ruffian, who was al&s;o ma&s;ked, watching over and menacing her, not by words but ge&s;tures. Ellena's &s;hrieks &s;eemed to recall the almo&s;t lifele&s;s Beatrice, for whom &s;he &s;upplicated as much as for her&s;elf; but entreaty was alike unavailing for each, and Ellena was borne from the hou&s;e and through the garden. All con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s had now for&s;aken her. On recovering, &s;he perceived her&s;elf in a carriage which was driven with great rapidity, and that her arms were within the gra&s;p of &s;ome per&s;ons, whom, when her recollection returned more fully, &s;he believ|ed to be the men, who had carried her from the villa. The darkne&s;s prevented her from ob&s;erving their fi|gures, and to all her que&s;tions and entreaties a death|like &s;ilence was ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>During the whole night the carriage proceeded ra|pidly, &s;topping only while the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;es were changed, when Ellena endeavoured to intere&s;t by her cries the compa&s;&s;ion of the people at the po&s;t-hou&s;es, and by her cries only, for the blinds were clo&s;ely drawn. The po&s;tillions, no doubt impo&s;ed on the credulity of the&s;e people, for they were in&s;en&s;ible to her di&s;tre&s;s, and her
<PB N="90" REF="032735_0088_0FF493EFCF9CA0B8">
immediate companions &s;oon overcame the only means that had remained by which &s;he could make it known.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t hours, a tumult of terror and amaze|ment occupied her mind, but, as this began to &s;ub&s;ide, and her under&s;tanding to recover its clearne&s;s, grief and de&s;pondency mingled with her fears. She &s;aw her&s;elf &s;eparated from Vivaldi, probably for ever, for &s;he apprehended that the &s;trong and invi&s;ible hand which governed her cour&s;e, would never relinqui&s;h its gra&s;p till it had placed her irrecoverably beyond the reach of her lover. A conviction that &s;he &s;hould &s;ee him no more, came, at intervals with &s;uch over|whelming force, that every con&s;ideration and emoti|on di&s;appeared before it; and at the&s;e moments &s;he lo&s;t all anxiety as to the place of her de&s;tination, and all fear as to her per&s;onal &s;afety.</P>
<P>As the morning advanced and the heat encrea&s;ed, the blinds were let down a little to admit air, and El|lena then perceived, that only two of the men, who had appeared at the villa Altieri, were in the carriage, and that they were &s;till di&s;gui&s;ed in cloaks and vi&s;ors. She had no means of judging through what part of the country &s;he was travelling, for above the &s;mall open|ings which the blinds left &s;he could &s;ee only the tower|ing tops of mountains, or &s;ometimes the veiny preci|pices and tangled thickets, that clo&s;ely impended over the road,</P>
<P>About noon, as &s;he judged from the exce&s;&s;ive heat, the carriage &s;topped at a po&s;t-hou&s;e, and ice-water was handed through the window, when, as the blind was lowered to admit it, &s;he perceived her&s;elf on a wild and &s;olatary plain, &s;urrounded by mountains and woods. The people at the door of the po&s;t-hou&s;e &s;eemed "unu&s;ed to pity or be pitied." The lean and &s;allow countenance of poverty &s;tared over their gaunt bones, and habitual di&s;content had fixed the furrows of their cheeks. They regarded Ellena with only a
<PB N="91" REF="032735_0089_0FF49449B2E845B8">
feeble curio&s;ity, though the affliction in her looks might have intere&s;ted almo&s;t any heart that was not corroded by its own &s;ufferings; nor did the ma&s;ked faces of her companions excite a much &s;tronger atten|tion.</P>
<P>Ellena accepted the cool refre&s;hment offered her, the fir&s;t &s;he had taken on the road. Her companions having emptied their gla&s;&s;es drew up the blind, and, notwith&s;tanding the almo&s;t intolerable heat of noon, the carriage proceeded. Fainting under its oppre&s;&s;ion, Ellena entreated that the windows might he open, when the men, in compliance with their own nece&s;&s;ity rather than with her reque&s;t, lowered the blinds, and &s;he had a glimp&s;e of the lofty region of the mountains, but of no object that could direct her conjecture con|cerning where &s;he was. She &s;aw only pinnacles and va&s;t precipices of various-tinted marbles, intermingled with &s;canty vegetation, &s;uch as &s;tunted pina&s;ters, dwarf oak and holly, which gave dark touches to the many-coloured cliffs, and &s;ometimes &s;tretched in &s;ha|dowy ma&s;&s;es to the deep vallies, that, winding into ob|&s;curity, &s;eemed to invite curio&s;ity to explore the &s;cenes beyond. Below the&s;e bold precipices extended the gloomy regions of olive-trees, and lower &s;till other rocky &s;teeps &s;unk towards the plains, bearing terra|ces crowned with vines, and were often the artificial &s;oil was propped by thickets of juniper, pomegranates and oleander.</P>
<P>Ellena, after having been &s;o long &s;hut in darkne&s;s, and brooding over her own alarming circum&s;tances found temporary, though feeble, relief in once more looking upon the face of nature; till, her &s;pirits be|ing gradually revived and elevated by the grandeur of the images around her, &s;he &s;aid to her&s;elf, "If I am condemned to mi&s;ery, &s;urely I could endure it with more fortitude it &s;cenes like the&s;e, than amid&s;t the ta|mer land&s;capes of nature! Here, the objects &s;eem to
<PB N="92" REF="032735_0090_0FF493F15627A950">
impart &s;omewhat of their own &s;ublimity, to the &s;oul. It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to yield to the pre&s;&s;ure of mi&s;|fortunes while we walk, as with the Deity, amid&s;t his mo&s;t &s;tupendous works!"</P>
<P>But &s;oon after the idea of Vivaldi glancing athwart her memory, &s;he melted into tears; the weakne&s;s however was momentary, and during the re&s;t of the journey &s;he pre&s;erved a &s;trenuous equality of mind.</P>
<P>It was when the heat and the light were declining that the carriage entered a rocky defile, which &s;hewed, as through a telle&s;cope rever&s;ed di&s;tant plains, and moun|tains opening beyond, lighted up with all the purple &s;plendor of the &s;etting &s;un. Along this deep and &s;ha|dowy per&s;pective a river, which was &s;een de&s;cending among the cliffs of a mountain, rolled with impetuous force, fretting and foaming amid&s;t the dark rocks in its de&s;cent, and then flowing in a limpid lap&s;e to the brink of other precipices, whence again it fell with thundering &s;trength to the aby&s;s, throwing its mi&s;ty clouds of &s;pray high in the air, and &s;eeming to claim the &s;ole empire of this &s;olitary wild. Its bed took up the whole breadth of the cha&s;m, which &s;ome &s;trong convul&s;ion of the earth &s;eemed to have formed, not leaving &s;pace even for a road along its margin. The road, therefore, was carried high among the cliffs, that impended over the river, and &s;eemed as if &s;u&s;pend|ed in the air; while the gloom and va&s;tne&s;s of the precipices, which towered above and &s;unk below it, together with the amazing force and uproar of the falling waters combined to render the pa&s;s more terri|fic than the pencil could de&s;cribe, or language can ex|pre&s;s. Ellena a&s;cended it, not with indifference but with calmne&s;s; &s;he experienced &s;omewhat of a dread|ful plea&s;ure in looking down upon the irre&s;i&s;tible flood; but this emotion was heightened into awe, when &s;he perceived that the road led to a &s;light bridge,
<PB N="93" REF="032735_0091_0FF49454152F33D8">
which, thrown acro&s;s the cha&s;m at an immen&s;e height, united two oppo&s;ite cliffs, between which the whole cataract of the river de&s;cended. The bridge, which was defended only by a &s;lender railing, appeared as if hung amid&s;t the clouds. Ellena, while &s;he was cro&s;|&s;ing it, almo&s;t forgot her misfortunes. Having reach|ed the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the glen, the road gradually de&s;cended the precipices for about half a mile, when it opened to exten&s;ive pro&s;pects over plains and towards di&s;tant mountains&mdash;the &s;un&s;hine land&s;cape, which had long appeared to bound this &s;hadowy pa&s;s. The tran|&s;ition was as the pa&s;&s;age through the vale of death to the bli&s;s of eternity; but the idea of its re&s;emblance did not long remain with Ellena. Perched high a|mong the cliffs of a mountain, which might be &s;aid to terminate one of the jaws of this terific gorge, and which was one of the loftie&s;t of a chain that &s;urround|ed the plains, appeared the &s;pires and long terraces of a mona&s;try; and &s;he &s;oon under&s;tood that her journey was to conclude there,</P>
<P>At the foot of this mountain her companions alight|ed, and obliged her to do the &s;ame, for the a&s;cent was too &s;teep and irregular to admit of a carriage. El|lena followed unre&s;i&s;tingly, like a lamb to the &s;acri|fice, up a path that wound among the rocks, and was coolly over-&s;hadowed by thickets of almond trees, figs broad-leaved myrtle, and ever-green ro&s;e bu&s;hes, in|termingled with the &s;trawberry tree, beautiful in fruit and blo&s;&s;oms, the yellow ja&s;emine, the delightful <HI>aca|cia mimo&s;a,</HI> and a variety of other fragrant plants. The&s;e bowers frequently admitted glimp&s;es of the glowing country below, and &s;ometimes opened to ex|pan&s;ive views bounded by the &s;nowy mountains of Abruzzo. At every &s;tep were objects which would have afforded plea&s;ure to a tranquil mind; the beau|tifully varigated marbles, that formed the cliffs imme|diately above, their fractured ma&s;&s;es embo&s;&s;ed with
<PB N="94" REF="032735_0092_0FF493FC645DAD58">
mo&s;&s;es and flowers of every vivid hue that paints the rainbow; the elegance of the &s;hrubs that tufted, and the maje&s;tic grace of the palms which waved over them would have charmed almo&s;t any other eye than Elle|na's, who&s;e &s;pirit was rapt in care or than tho&s;e of her companions, who&s;e hearts were dead to feeling. Par|tial features of the va&s;t edifice &s;he was approaching, appeared now and then between the trees; the tall we&s;t window of the cathedral with the &s;pires that over|topped it; the narrow pointed roofs of the cloi&s;ters; angles of the in&s;urmountable walls, which fenced the garden from the precipices below, and the dark portal leading into the chief court; each of the&s;e, &s;een at in|tervals beneath the gloom of cypre&s;s and &s;preading cedar, &s;eemed as if manacing the unhappy Ellena with hints of future &s;uffering. She pa&s;t &s;everal &s;hrines and images half hid among the &s;hrubs and the cliffs; and, when &s;he drew near the mona&s;tery, her companions &s;topped at a little chapel which &s;tood be&s;ide the path, where, after examining &s;ome papers, an act which &s;he ob&s;erved with &s;urpri&s;e, they drew a&s;ide, as if to con|&s;ult re&s;pecting her&s;elf. Their conver&s;ation was de|livered in voices &s;o low, that &s;he could not catch a &s;ingle tone di&s;tinctly, and it is probable that if &s;he could, this would not have a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in conjecturing who they were; yet the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound &s;ilence they had hi|therto ob&s;erved had much encrea&s;ed her curio&s;ity, now that they &s;poke.</P>
<P>One of them &s;oon after quitted the chapel, and pro|ceeded alone to the mona&s;tery, leaving Ellena in the cu&s;tody of his comrade, who&s;e pity &s;he now made a la&s;t, though almo&s;t hopele&s;s, effort to intere&s;t. He re|plied to all her entreaties only by a waving of the hand and an averted face; and &s;he endeavoured to meet with fortitude and to endure with patience, the evil which &s;he could neither avoid nor &s;ubdue. The &s;pot where &s;he awaited the return of the ruffian, was not of a cha|racter
<PB N="95" REF="032735_0093_0FF494559B8FB9A0">
to promote melancholy, except, indeed, that lux|urious &s;olemn kind of melancholy, which a view of &s;tupendous objects in&s;pires. It overlooked the whole, extent of plains, of which &s;he had before caught partia &s;cenes, with the va&s;t chain of mountains, which &s;eem|ed to form an in&s;urmountable rampart to the rich land|&s;cape at their feet. There towering and fanta&s;tical &s;um|mits, crowding together into du&s;ky air, like flames ta|pering to apoint, exhibited images of peculiar grandeur, which each minuter line and feature withdrawing, at this evening hour from ob&s;ervation, &s;eemed to re&s;olve it&s;elf into the more gigantic ma&s;&s;es, to which the du|bious tint, the &s;olemn ob&s;curity, that began to pre|vail over them, gave force and loftier character. The &s;ilence and deep repo&s;e of the land&s;cape, &s;erved to im|pre&s;s this character more awfully on the heart, and while Ellena &s;at rapt in the thoughtfulne&s;s it promoted, the ve&s;per-&s;ervice of the monks breathing &s;oftly from the cathedral above, came to her ear; it was a mu&s;ic which might be &s;aid to win on &s;ilence, and was in per|fect uni&s;on with her feelings; &s;olemn, deep, and full, it &s;welled in holy peals, and rolled away in murmurs, which attention pur&s;ued to the la&s;t faint note that melted into air. Ellena's heart owned the power of its high min&s;trel&s;y; and while &s;he caught for a mo|ment the &s;weeter voices of the nuns mingling in the chorus, &s;he iudulged a hope that they would not be wholly in&s;en&s;ible to her &s;ufferings, and that &s;he &s;hould receive &s;ome con&s;olation from &s;ympathy as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oft as the&s;e tender-breathing &s;trains appeared to indicate.</P>
<P>She had re&s;ted nearly half an hour on the turfy &s;lope before the chapel, when &s;he perceived thro' the twi|light, two monks de&s;cending from the mona&s;tery to|wards the &s;pot where &s;he &s;at. As they drew near, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed their dre&s;s of grey &s;tuff, the hood, the &s;haven head, where only a coronet of white hair was left, and other en&s;igns of their particular Order. On
<PB N="96" REF="032735_0094_0FF493FDE9C000E8">
reaching the chapel they acco&s;ted her companion, with whom they retired a few paces, and conver&s;ed. El|lena heard, for the fir&s;t time the &s;ound of her con|ductor's voice, and though this was but faintly, &s;he marked it well. The other ruffian did not appear, but it &s;eemed evident that the&s;e friars had left the con|vent in con&s;equence of his information; and &s;ome|times when &s;he looked upon the taller of the two, &s;he fancied &s;he &s;aw the per&s;on of the very man who&s;e ab|&s;ence &s;he had remarked, a conjecture which &s;trength|ened while &s;he more accurately noticed him. The portrait had certainly much re&s;emblance in height and bulk; and the &s;ame gaunt awkwardne&s;s, which even the cloak of the ruffian had not entirely &s;hrouded, ob|truded it&s;elf from under the folded garments of the re|clu&s;e. If countenance, too, might be tru&s;ted, this &s;ame friar had a ruffian's heart, and his keen and cun|ning eye &s;eemed habitually upon the watch for prey. His brother of the order &s;hewed nothing &s;trongly characteri&s;tic either in his face or manner.</P>
<P>After a private conver&s;ation of &s;ome length, the fri|ars approached Ellena, and told her, that &s;he mu&s;t accompany them to the convent; when her di&s;gui&s;ed conductor, having re&s;igned her to them, immediately departed and de&s;cended the mountain.</P>
<P>Not a word was uttered by either of the party as they pur&s;ued the deep tract leading to the gates of this &s;e|cluded edifice, which were opened to them by a lay-brother, and Ellena entered a &s;pacious court. Three &s;ides of this were clo&s;ed by lofty buildings, lined with ranges of cloi&s;ters; the fourth opened to a garden, &s;haded with avenues of melancholy cypre&s;s, that ex|tended to the cathedral, who&s;e fretted windows and ornamented &s;pires appeared to clo&s;e the per&s;pective. Other large and detached buildings &s;kirted the gar|dens on the left, while, on the right, &s;pacious olive grounds and vineyards &s;pread to the cliffs that formed
<PB N="97" REF="032735_0095_0FF4945723071250">
a barrier to all this &s;ide of the domain of the convent.</P>
<P>The friar, her conductor, cro&s;&s;ed the court to the north wing, and there ringing a bell a door was open|ed by a nun, into who&s;e hands Ellena was giv|en. A &s;ignificant look was exchanged between the devotees, but no words; the friar departed, and the nun, &s;till &s;ilent, conducted her through many &s;olitary pa&s;&s;ages, where not even a di&s;tant foot-fall echoed, and who&s;e walls were roughly painted with &s;ubjects indicatory of the &s;evere &s;uper&s;titions of the place, tend|ing to in&s;pire melancholy awe. Ellena's hope of pi|ty vani&s;hed as her eyes glanced over the&s;e &s;ymbols of the di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabitants, and on the counte|nance of the nun characteri&s;ed by a gloomy malignity, which &s;eemed ready to inflict upon others &s;ome porti|on of the unhappine&s;s &s;he her&s;elf &s;uffered. As &s;he glided forward with &s;oundle&s;s &s;tep, her white drapery, floating along the&s;e &s;olemn avenues, and her hollow features touched with the mingled light and &s;hadow which the partial rays of a taper &s;he held occa&s;ioned, &s;he &s;eemed like a &s;pectre newly ri&s;en from the grave, rather than a living being. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages ter|minated in the parlour of the Abbe&s;s, where the nun pau&s;ed, and turning to Ellena, &s;aid, "It is the hour of ve&s;pers; you will wait here till our lady of the con|vent leaves&punc; the church; &s;he would &s;peak with you."</P>
<P>"To what &s;aint is the convent dedicated," &s;aid El|lena, "and who, &s;i&s;ter, pre&s;ides over it?</P>
<P>The nun gave no reply, and after having eyed the forlorn &s;tranger for a moment, with inqui&s;itive ill-nature, quitted the room. The unhappy Ellena had not been le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t long to her own reflections, when the Abbe&s;s appeared; a &s;tately lady, apparently occu|pied with opinions of her own importance, and pre|pared to receive her gue&s;t with rigour and &s;upercilious haughtine&s;s. This Abbe&s;s, who was her&s;elf a wo|man of &s;ome di&s;tinction, believed that of all po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="98" REF="032735_0096_0FF493FF71185FE8">
crimes, next to that of &s;acrilege, offences again&s;t per|&s;ons of rank were lea&s;t pardonable. It is not &s;urpri|&s;ing, therefore, that &s;uppo&s;ing, Ellena a young wo|man of no family, to have &s;ought clande&s;tinely to u|nite her&s;elf with the noble hou&s;e of Vivaldi, &s;hould feel for her, not only di&s;dain, but indignation, and that &s;he &s;hould readily con&s;ent, not only to puni&s;h the offender, but at the &s;ame time, to afford means of pre|&s;erving the ancient dignity of the offended.</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand," &s;aid the Abbe&s;s, on who&s;e appear|ance the alarmed Ellena had ari&s;en, "I under&s;tand," &s;aid &s;he, without making any &s;ignal for her to be &s;eat|ed, "that you are the young per&s;on who is arrived from Naples,"</P>
<P>"My name is Ellena di Ro&s;alba," &s;aid her auditor, recovering &s;ome degree of courage from the manner which was de&s;igned to depre&s;s her.</P>
<P>"I know nothing of your name," replied the &s;upe|rior; "I am informed only that you are &s;ent here to acquire a knowledge of your&s;elf and of your duties. Till the period &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed, for which you are given into my charge, I &s;hall &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erve the obli|gations of the trouble&s;ome office, which my regard for the honor of a noble family, has induced me to un|dertake."</P>
<P>By the&s;e words, the author and the motives of this extraordinary tran&s;action were at once revealed to El|lena, who was for &s;ome moments almo&s;t overwhelmed by the &s;udden horrors that gathered in her mind, and &s;tood &s;ilent and motionle&s;s. Fear, &s;hame, indignati|on, alternately a&s;&s;ailed her; and the &s;ting of offended honor, on being &s;u&s;pected, and thus accu&s;ed of having voluntarily di&s;turbed the tranquility, and &s;ought the alliance of any family, and e&s;pecially of one who di&s;|dained her, &s;truck forcibly to her heart, till the pride of con&s;cious worth revived her courage and fortified her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and &s;he demanded by who&s;e will &s;he had
<PB N="99" REF="032735_0097_0FF49458A7BECE00">
been torn from her hou&s;e, and by who&s;e authority &s;he was now detained, as it appeared, a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>The Abbe&s;s, unaccu&s;tomed to have her power op|po&s;ed, or her words que&s;tioned, was for a moment too indignant to reply; and Ellena ob&s;erved, but no long|er with di&s;may, the brooding tempe&s;t ready to bur&s;t over her head. "It is I only who am injured," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "and &s;hall the guilty oppre&s;&s;or triumph, and the innocent &s;ufferer &s;ink under the &s;hame that belongs only to guilt! Never will I yield to a weak|ne&s;s &s;o contemptible. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of de&s;erving well, will recall my pre&s;ence of mind, which permit|ting me to e&s;timate the characters of my oppre&s;&s;ors by their actions, will enable me al&s;o to di&s;pi&s;e their power."</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t remind you," &s;aid the Abbe&s;s, at length, "that the que&s;tions you make are unbecoming in your &s;ituation; and that contrition and humility are the be&s;t extenuations of error. You may withdraw."</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t true," replied Ellena, bowing with digni|ty to the Superior; "and I mo&s;t willingly re&s;ign them to my oppre&s;&s;ors."</P>
<P>Ellena forebore to make further&punc; enquiry or remon|&s;trance, and perceiving that reproach would not only be u&s;ele&s;s, but degrading to her&s;elf, &s;he immediately obeyed the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ate of the Abbe&s;s, and determined &s;ince &s;he mu&s;t &s;uffer, to &s;uffer if po&s;&s;ible, with firm|ne&s;s and dignity.</P>
<P>She was conducted from the parlour by the nun who had admitted her, and as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through the refactory where the nuns, ju&s;t returned from ve&s;pers, were a&s;&s;embled, their inqui&s;itive glances, their &s;miles and bu&s;y whi&s;pers, told her, that &s;he was not only an object of curio&s;ity, but of &s;u&s;picion, and that little &s;ym|pathy could be expected from hearts, which even the offices of hourly devotion had not purified from the
<PB N="100" REF="032735_0098_0FF46F201A8060C8">
malignant envy, that taught them to exalt them&s;elves upon the humiliation of others.</P>
<P>The little room to which Ellena was led, and where, to her great &s;atisfaction, &s;he was left alone, ra|ther de&s;erved the denomination of a cell than of a chamber; &s;ince, like tho&s;e of the nuns, it had only one &s;mall lattice; and a mattre&s;s, one chair, and a ta|ble, with a prayer-book were all its furniture. Elle|na, as &s;he &s;urveyed her melancholy habitation, &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed a ri&s;ing &s;igh, but &s;he could not remain unaf|fected by recollections, which, on this view of her al|tered &s;tate, crowded to her mind: nor think of Vival|di far away, perhaps for ever, and probably, even ig|norant of her di&s;tination, without bitter tears. But &s;he dried them, as the idea of the Marche&s;a obtruded on her thoughts, for other emotions than tho&s;e of grief po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her. It was to the Marche&s;a that &s;he e&s;pecially attributed her pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and it now appeared that the family of Vivaldi had not only been reluctant, but ab&s;olutely aver&s;e to a connection with hers, contrary to the &s;ugge&s;tions of Signora Bianchi, who had repre&s;ented, that it might be &s;uppo&s;ed only, from their known character, that they would di&s;ap|prove of the alliance, but would of cour&s;e be reconcil|ed to an event, which their haughtie&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure ne|ver could revoke. This di&s;covery of their ab&s;olute rejection awakened all the proper pride, which the mi&s;taken prudence of her aunt, and her affection for Vivaldi had lulled to re&s;t; and &s;he now &s;uffered the mo&s;t acute vexation and remor&s;e, for having yielded her con&s;ent to enter clande&s;tinely into any family. The imaginary honors of &s;o noble an alliance vani&s;h|ed, when the terms of obtaining them were con&s;ider|ed; and now, that the &s;ound mind of Ellena was left to its own judgment, &s;he looked with infinitely more pride and preference upon the indu&s;trious means,
<PB N="101" REF="032735_0099_0FF494A64169F810">
which had hitherto rendered her independent, than on all di&s;tinction which might be reluctantly conferred. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of innocence, which had &s;upported her in the pre&s;ence of the Superior, began to falter. "Her accu&s;ation was partly ju&s;t!" &s;aid Ellena, "and I de&s;erve puni&s;hment, &s;ince I could even for a mo|ment, &s;ubmit to the humiliation of de&s;iring an alli|ance, which I knew would be unwillingly conferred. But it is not yet too late to retrieve my own e&s;teem by a&s;&s;erting my independence, and re&s;igning Vivaldi for ever. By re&s;igning him! by abandoning him who loves me,&mdash;abandoning him to mi&s;ery! Him, whom I cannot even think of without tears,&mdash;to whom my vows have been given,&mdash;who may claim me by the &s;acred remembrance of my dying friend,&mdash;him, to whom my whole heart is devoted! O! mi&s;erable al|ternative!&mdash;that I can no longer act ju&s;tly, but at the expence of all my future happine&s;s! Ju&s;tly! And would it then be ju&s;t to abandon him who is willing to re&s;ign every thing for me,&mdash;abandon him to cea&s;e|le&s;s &s;orrow, that the prejudices of his family may be gratified?"</P>
<P>Poor Ellena perceived that &s;he could not obey the dictates of a ju&s;t pride, without &s;uch oppo&s;ition from her heart as &s;he had never experienced before. Her affections were now too deeply engaged to permit her to act with firmne&s;s, at the price of long-&s;uffering. The con&s;ideration of re&s;igning Vivaldi was &s;o very grievous, that &s;he could &s;carcely endure to pau&s;e up|on it for a moment; yet, on the other hand, when &s;he thought of his family, it appeared that &s;he never could con&s;ent to make a part of it. She would have blamed the eroneous judgment of Signora Bianchi, who&s;e per&s;ua&s;ions had &s;o much a&s;&s;i&s;ted in reducing her to the pre&s;ent alternative, had not the tenderne&s;s with which &s;he cheri&s;hed her memory, rendered this impo&s;&s;ible. All, that now remained for her, was to endeavour pa|tiently
<PB N="102" REF="032735_0100_0FF46F232A96FC10">
to endure pre&s;ent evils which &s;he could not conquer; for, to for&s;ake Vivaldi as the price of liber|ty, &s;hould liberty be offered her on &s;uch terms, or to accept him in defiance of honorable pride, &s;hould he ever affect her relea&s;e, appeared to her di&s;tracted thoughts almo&s;t equally impracticable But, as the probability of never being able to di&s;cover her abode, returned to her con&s;ideration, the angui&s;h &s;he &s;uffered told how much more &s;he dreaded to lo&s;e then to accept Vivaldi, and that love was, after all, the mo&s;t power|ful affection of her heart.</P>

<P>VIVALDI, meanwhile, ignorant of what had oc|curred at the villa Altieri, repaired as he had propo&s;ed to Paluzzi, attended hy his &s;ervant Paulo. It was deep night before he left Naples, and &s;o anxious was he to conceal him&s;elf from ob&s;ervation, that though Paulo carried a torch, he did not permit it to be lighted, till after he &s;hould have remained &s;ome time within the arch-way, thinking it mo&s;t prudent to watch awhile in &s;ecret for his unknown advi&s;er, before he proceeded to examine the fort.</P>
<P>His attendant, Paulo, was a true Neapolitian, &s;hrewd, inqui&s;itive, in&s;inuating, adroit; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing much of the &s;pirit of intrigue, together with a con&s;iderable portion of humour, which di&s;played it&s;elf not &s;o much in words, as in his manner and countenance, in the archne&s;s of his dark, penetrating eye, and in the exqui&s;ite adapta|tion of his ge&s;ture to his idea. He was a di&s;tingui&s;hed favourite of his ma&s;ter, who, if he had not humour him|&s;elf, had a keen reli&s;h for it in others, and who certain|ly did po&s;&s;e&s;s wit, with all its lively accompaniments, in an eminent degree. Vivaldi had been won by the <HI>naivete</HI> and humour of this man, to allow him an unu|&s;ual degree of familiarity in conver&s;ation; and, as they now walked together towards Paluzzi, he unfolded to Paulo as much of his former adventure there as he judged nece&s;&s;ary to intere&s;t his curio&s;ity and excite his vigilance. The relation did both. Paulo, however, naturally courageous, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ncredulous to &s;uper&s;tition of any kind; and having quickly perceived that his ma&s;ter was not altogether indi&s;po&s;ed to attribute to a &s;uperna|tural cau&s;e the extraordinary occurrences at paluzzi, he
<PB N="104" REF="032735_0102_0FF46F24DB1CDF48">
began, in his manner, to rally him; but Vivaldi was not in temper to endure je&s;ting; his mood was grave, even to &s;olemnity, and he yeilded, though reluctantly, to the awe which, at intervails, returned upon him with the force of a magical &s;pell, binding up all his fa|culties to &s;ternne&s;s, and fixing them in expectation. While he was nearly regardle&s;s of defence again&s;t hu|man agency, his &s;ervant was, however, preparing for that alone; and very properly repre&s;ented the impru|dence of going to Paluzzi in darkne&s;s. Vivaldi ob|&s;erved that they could not watch for the monk other|wi&s;e than in darkne&s;s. &s;ince the torch which lighted them would al&s;o warn him, and he had very particular rea&s;ons for watching before he proceeded to examine. He added, that after a certain time had elap&s;ed, the torch might be lighted at a neighbouring cottage. Paulo objected, that in the meanwhile, the per&s;on for whom they watched might e&s;cape; and Vivaldi com|promi&s;ed the affair. The torch was lighted but con|cealed within a hollow of the cliffs, that bordered on the road, and the centinels took their &s;tation in dark|ne&s;s, within the deep arch, near the &s;pot where Vival|di had watched with Bonarmo. As they did this, the di&s;tant chime of a convent informed Vivaldi that mid|night was turned. The &s;ound recalled to his mind the the words of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, concerning the vicinity of the convent of the <HI>Black Penitents,</HI> to Paluzzi, and he a&s;|ked Paulo whether this was the chime of that convent. Paulo replied that it was, and that a remarkable cir|cum&s;tance had taught him to remember <HI>the Santa del Pianto,</HI> or <HI>our Lady of Tears.</HI> "The place, Signor, would intere&s;t you," &s;aid Paulo for there are &s;ome-odd &s;tories told of it; and I am inclined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o think, this un|known monk mu&s;t be one of that &s;ociety, his conduct is &s;o &s;trange."</P>
<P>"You believe then, that I am willing to give faith to wonderful &s;tories," &s;aid Vivaldi, &s;miling.</P>
<P>"But what have you heard, that is &s;o extraordinary,
<PB N="105" REF="032735_0103_0FF46EB36468EC40">
re&s;pecting this convent? Speak low, or we may be di&s;|covered."</P>
<P>"Why, Signor, the &s;tory is not generally known," &s;aid Paulo in a whi&s;per; "I half promi&s;ed never to re|veal it."</P>
<P>"If you are under any promi&s;e of &s;ecre&s;y," interrup|ed Vivaldi, "I forbid you to tell this wonderful tale, which, however, &s;eems &s;omewhat too bad to re&s;t with|in your brain."</P>
<P>"The &s;tory would fain expand it&s;elf to your's Sig|nor," &s;aid Paulo; "and, as I did not ab&s;olutely pro|mi&s;e to conceal it, I am very willing to reveal it."</P>
<P>"Proceed, then," &s;aid Vivaldi; "but l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t me once more caution you to &s;peak low."</P>
<P>"You are obeyed, Signor. You mu&s;t know then, <HI>Mae&s;tro,</HI> that it was on the eve of the fe&s;tival of <HI>San|to Marco</HI> and about &s;ix years &s;ince."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Peace!" &s;aid Vivaldi. They were &s;ilent; but every thing remaining &s;till, Paulo, after &s;ome time ventured to proceed, though in a yet &s;lower whi&s;per. "It was on the eve of the <HI>Santo Marco,</HI> and when the la&s;t bell had rung, that a per&s;on"&mdash;He &s;topped again, for a ru&s;tling &s;ound pa&s;&s;ed near him.</P>
<P>"You are too late," &s;aid a &s;udden voice be&s;ide Vivaldi, who in&s;tantly recognized the thrilling accents of the monk.&mdash;"It is pa&s;t midnight; &s;he departed an hour ago. Look to your &s;teps!"</P>
<P>Though thrilled by this well known voice, Vivaldi &s;carcely yielded to his feelings for a moment, but, chec|ing the que&s;tion which would have a&s;ked "who de|parted?" he, by a &s;udden &s;pring, endeavoured to &s;ieze the intruder, while Paulo, in the fir&s;t hurry of his alarm fired a pi&s;tol, and then ha&s;tened for the torch. So cer|tainly did Vivaldi beleive him&s;elf to have leaped upon the &s;pot whence the voice proceeded, that, on reaching it, he in&s;tantly extended his arms and &s;earching around expected every moment to find his enemy in his gra&s;p.</P>
<P>Darkne&s;s again bafled his attempt&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="032735_0104_0FF46F2835732E88">
"You are known," cried Vivaldi; "you &s;hall &s;ee me at the <HI>Santa del Pianto!</HI> What, oh! Paulo, the torch!&mdash;the torch!"</P>
<P>Paulo, &s;wift as the wind, appeared with it. "He pa&s;&s;ed up tho&s;e &s;teps in the rock, Signor; I &s;aw the &s;kirts of his garments a&s;cending!"</P>
<P>"Follow me, then," &s;aid Vivaldi, mounting the &s;teps. "Away, away, <HI>Mae&s;tro!"</HI> &s;aid Paulo, impa|tiently; "but for Heaven's &s;ake, name no more the convent of the <HI>Santa del Pianto;</HI> our lives may an|&s;wer it!"</P>
<P>He followed to the terrace above, where Vivaldi, holding high the torch, looked round for the monk. The place, however, as far as his eye could penetrate, was for&s;aken and &s;ilent. The glare of the torch en|lightened only the rude walls of the citadel, &s;ome points of the cliff below, and &s;ome tall pines that waved over them, leaving in doubtful gloom many a rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s of the ruin, and many a tangled thicket, that &s;pread a|mong the rocks beyond.</P>
<P>"Do you perceive any per&s;on, Paulo?" &s;aid Vival di, waving the torch in the air to rou&s;e the flame.</P>
<P>"Among tho&s;e arches on the left, Signor, tho&s;e arches that &s;tand du&s;kily beyond the citadel, I thought I &s;aw a &s;hadowy &s;ort of a figure pa&s;s. He might be a gho&s;t, by his &s;ilence, for aught I know, <HI>Mae&s;tro;</HI> but he &s;eems to have a good mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> in&s;tinct in taking care of him&s;elf, and to have as &s;wift a pair of heels to a&s;&s;i&s;t in carrying him off, as any Lazaro in Naples need de&s;ire</P>
<P>"Fewer words, and more caution!" &s;aid Vivaldi, lowering the torch, and pointing it towards the quar|ter which Paulo had mentioned, "Be vigilant, and tread lightly."</P>
<P>"You are obeyed, Signor; but their eyes will in|form them, though their ears refu&s;e, while we hold a light to our &s;teps."</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="032735_0105_0FF46EB6F7830770">
"Peace, with this buffoonery!" &s;aid Vivaldi, &s;ome|what &s;ternly; "follow in &s;ilence, and be on your guard."</P>
<P>Paulo &s;ubmitted and they proceeded towards the range of arches; which communicated with the build|ing, who&s;e &s;ingular &s;tructure had formerly arre&s;ted the attention of Bonarmo, and whence Vivaldi him&s;elf had returned with &s;uch unexpected precipitancy and con|&s;ternation.</P>
<P>On perceiving the place he was approaching, he &s;uddenly &s;topped and Paulo, ob&s;erving his agitation, and probably not reli&s;hing the adventure, endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from further re&s;earch: "For we know not who may inhabit this gloomy place, Signor, or their numbers, and we are only two of us after all. Be|&s;ides, Signor, it was through that door, yonder;" and he pointed to the very &s;pot whence Vivaldi had &s;o fear|fully i&s;&s;ued; "through that door, that I fancied ju&s;t now, I &s;aw &s;omething pa&s;s."</P>
<P>"Are you certain as to this?" &s;aid Vivaldi, with encrea&s;ed emotion. "What was its form?"</P>
<P>"It was &s;o du&s;ky thereabout, Mae&s;tro, that I could not di&s;tingui&s;h."</P>
<P>Vivaldi's eyes were fixed upon the building, and a vi|olent conflict of feelings &s;eemed to &s;hake his &s;oul. A few &s;econds decided it. "I will go on," &s;aid he, "and terminate, at any hazard, this &s;tate of intolerable anx|iety. Paulo, pau&s;e a moment, and con&s;ider well, whe|ther you can depend on your courage, for it may be &s;everely tried. If you can de&s;cend with me in &s;ilence, and I warn you to be wary; if you cannot, I will go alone."</P>
<P>"It is too late now, Signor, to a&s;k my&s;elf that que&s;|tion," replied Paulo, with a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive air; "and if I had not &s;ettled it long ago, I &s;hould not have follow|ed you thus far. My courage, Signor, you never doubted before."</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="032735_0106_0FF46F2C6CEE9040">
"Come on then," &s;aid Vivaldi. He drew his &s;word, and entering the narrow door-way, the torch, which he had now re&s;igned to Paulo, &s;hewed a &s;tone pa&s;&s;age, that was, however, interminable to the eye.</P>
<P>As they proceeded, Paulo ob&s;erved that the walls were &s;tained in &s;everal places with what appeared to be blood, but prudently forbore to point out this to his ma&s;ter, ob&s;erving the &s;trict injunction of &s;ilence he had received.</P>
<P>Vivaldi &s;tepped cautiou&s;ly, and often pau&s;ed to li&s;t|en, after which he went on with a quicker pace, mak|ing &s;igns only to Paulo to follow, and be vigilant.&mdash;The pa&s;&s;age terminated in a &s;tairca&s;e, that &s;eemed to lead to vaults below. Vivaldi remembered the light which had formerly appeared there, and, as recollection of the pa&s;t gathered on his mind, he faultered in his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Again he pau&s;ed, looked back upon Paulo, but was going forward, when Paulo him&s;elf &s;eized his arm.&mdash;"Stop! Signor," &s;aid he in a low voice. "Do you not di&s;tingui&s;h a figure &s;tanding yonder in the gloom?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi looked onward, and perceived indi&s;tinctly, &s;omething as of human form, but motionle&s;s and &s;ilent.</P>
<P>It &s;tood at the du&s;ky extremity of the avenue, near the &s;tair-ca&s;e. Its garments, if garments they were, were dark; but its whole figure was &s;o &s;aintly traced to the eye, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain whether this was the monk. Vivaldi took the light, and held it forward, endeavouring to di&s;tingui&s;h the object be|fore he ventured further; but the enquiry was u&s;ele&s;s, and re&s;igning the torch to Paulo, he ru&s;hed on. When he reached the head of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, however, the form, whatever it might be, was gone. Vivaldi had heard no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">p. Paulo pointed out the exact &s;pot where it had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ood, but no ve&s;tige of it appeared. Vivaldi called loudly upon the monk, but he heard only the lengthening echoes of his own voice revolving a|mong
<PB N="109" REF="032735_0107_0FF46EBAF4C20AE0">
the chambers below; and, after he&s;itating a while on the head of the &s;tairs, he de&s;cended.</P>
<P>Paulo had not followed down many &s;teps, when he called out, "It is there! Signor; I &s;ee it again! and now again! and now it flits away through the door that opens to the vaults!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi pur&s;ued &s;o &s;wiftly, that Paulo could &s;carce|ly follow fa&s;t enough with the light; and, as at length he re&s;ted to take breath, he perceived him&s;elf in the &s;ame &s;pacious chamber to which he had formerly de|&s;cended. At this moment Paulo perceived his counte|nance change. "You are ill, Signor," &s;aid he, "In the name of our holy Saint, let us quit this hideous place. Its inhabitants can be nothing good, and no good can come of our remaining here."</P>
<P>Vivaldi made no reply; he drew breath with diffi|culty, and his eyes remained fixed on the ground, till a noi&s;e, like the creaking of a heavy hinge, ro&s;e in a di&s;tant part of the vault. Paulo turned his eye, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, towards the place whence it came, and they both perceived a door in the wall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lowly opened and immediately clo&s;ed again, as if the per&s;on within had feared to be di&s;covered. Each believed, from the tran&s;ient view he had of it, that this was the fame fi|gure which had appeared on the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and that it was the monk him&s;elf. Reanimated by this belief, Vi|valdi's nerves were in&s;tantly r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">braced, and he &s;prang to the door, which was unfa&s;tened and yielded immedi|ately to his impetuous hand, "You &s;hall not deceive me now," cried he, as he entered; "Paulo! keep guard at the door!"</P>
<P>He looked round the &s;econd vault, in which he now found him&s;elf, but no per&s;on appeared; he examined the place, and particularly the walls, without di&s;cover|ing any aperture, either of door or window, by which the figure could have quitted the chamber; a &s;trongly grated ca&s;ement, placed near the roof, was all that ad|mitted
<PB N="110" REF="032735_0108_0FF46F2DF78A2F78">
air and probably light. Vivaldi was a&s;toni&s;hed! "Have you &s;een any thing pa&s;s?" &s;aid he to Paulo.</P>
<P>"Nothing, Mae&s;tro," replied the &s;ervant.</P>
<P>"This is almo&s;t incredible," exclaimed, Vivaldi; "'tis certain, this form can be nothing human!"</P>
<P>"If &s;o, Signor," ob&s;erved Paulo, "why &s;hould it fear us? as &s;urely it does; or why &s;hould it have fled?"</P>
<P>"That is not &s;o certain," rejoined Vivaldi; "it may have fled only to lead us into evil. But bring hither the torch; here is &s;omething in the wall which I would examine."</P>
<P>Paulo obeyed. It was merely a ruggedne&s;s in the &s;tones, not the partition of a door, that had excited his curio&s;ity. "This is inexplicable," exclaimed Vivaldi, after a long pau&s;e. "What motive could any human being have for thus tormenting me?"</P>
<P>"Or any being &s;uperhuman, either, my Signor?" &s;aid Paulo.</P>
<P>"I am warned of evils that await me," continued Vivaldi, mu&s;ing: "of events that are regularly fulfilled; the being who warms me, cro&s;&s;es my path perpetually, yet, with the cunning of a demon, as con|&s;tantly eludes my gra&s;p, and baffles my pur&s;uit! It is incomprehen&s;ible, by what means he glides thus a|way from my eye, and fades, as if into air, at my ap|proach! He is repeatedly in my pre&s;ence, yet is nev|er to be found?"</P>
<P>"It is mo&s;t true, Signor," &s;aid Paulo, "that he is never to be found, and therefore let me entreat you to give up the pur&s;uit. This place is enough to make one believe in the horrors of purgatory? Let us go, Signor."</P>
<P>"What but &s;pirit could have quitted this vault &s;o my&s;teriou&s;ly," continued Vivaldi, not attending to Paulo; "what but &s;pirit!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I would fain prove," &s;aid the &s;ervant, "that &s;ub|&s;tance can quit it as ea&s;ily; I would fain evaporate through that door my&s;elf."</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="032735_0109_0FF46EBC85CE7EF8">
He had &s;carcely &s;poken the words, when the door clo&s;ed, with a thundering clap that echoed through all the vaults; and Vivaldi and Paulo &s;tood for a mo|ment agha&s;t! and then both ha&s;tened to open it, and to leave the place. Their con&s;ternation may be ea|&s;ily conceived, when they found that all their efforts at the door were ineffectual. The thick wood was in|laid with &s;olid bars of iron; and was of &s;uch uncon|querable &s;trength, that it evidently guarded what had been de&s;igned for a pri&s;on, and appeared to be the keep or dungeon of the ancient fort.</P>
<P>"Ah, Signor mio!" &s;aid Paulo," if this was a &s;pi|rit, 'tis plain he knew we were not &s;o, by his luring us hither. Would we could exchange natures with him for a moment; for I know not how, as mere mor|tal men, we can ever &s;queeze, our&s;elves out o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> this &s;crape.

<P>"Peace, good Signor <HI>Buffo!"</HI> &s;aid Vivaldi; "a truce with this non&s;en&s;e, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;earching for &s;ome means of e&s;cape."</P>
<P>Vivaldi again examined the walls, and as un&s;ucce&s;s|fully as before; but in one corner of the vault <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay an object, which &s;eemed to tell the fate of one who had been confined here, and to hint his own: it was a gar|ment covered with blood. Vivaldi and his &s;ervant di&s;covered it at the &s;ame in&s;tant; and a dreadful fore|boding of their own di&s;tin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> fixed them, for &s;ome mo|ments, to the &s;pot. Vivaldi fir&s;t recovered him&s;elf, when in&s;tead of yielding to de&s;pondency, all his facul|ties were arou&s;ed to divi&s;e &s;ome means for e&s;caping; but Paulo's hopes &s;eemed buried beneath the dreadful ve&s;tments upon which he &s;till gazed. "Ah, my Sig|nor!" &s;aid he, at length, in a faultering accent, "who &s;hall dare to rai&s;e that garment? What if it &s;hould conceal the mangled body who&s;e blood has &s;tained it!"</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="032735_0110_0FF46F2FA10C76E8">
Vivaldi, &s;hudderingly, turned to look on it again.</P>
<P>"It moves!" exclaimed Paulo; "I &s;ee it move!" as he &s;aid which, he &s;tarted to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the chamber. Vivaldi &s;tepped a few paces back, and as quickly returned; when, determined to know the event at once, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e rai&s;ed the garment upon the point of his &s;word, and perceived, beneath, other remains of dre&s;s, heaped high together, while even the floor below was &s;tained with gore.</P>
<P>Believing that fear had deceived the eyes of Paulo, Vivaldi watched this horrible &s;pectacle for &s;ome time, but without perceiving the lea&s;t motion; when he be|came convinced, that not any remains of life were &s;hrouded beneath it, and that it contained only articles of dre&s;s, which had belonged to &s;ome unfortunate per&s;on, who had probably been decoyed hither for plunder, and afterwards murdered. This belief, and the repugnance he felt to dwell upon the &s;pectacle, prevented him from examining further, and he turned away to a remote part of the vault. A conviction of his own fate, and of his &s;ervant's, filled his mind for a while with de|&s;pair. It appeared that he had been en&s;nared by rob|bers, till, as he recollected the circum&s;tances which had attended his entrance, and &s;everal peculiar occurrences connected with the arch&punc;way, this conjecture &s;eemed highly improbable: It was unrea&s;onable, that robbers &s;hould have taken the trouble to decoy, when they might at fir&s;t have &s;eized him; &s;till more &s;o, that they would have per&s;evered &s;o long in the attempt; and mo&s;t of all, that when he had formerly been in their power, they &s;hould have neglected their opportunity, and &s;uffered him to leave the ruin unmole&s;ted. Yet, granting that all this, improbable as it was, were, however, po&s;&s;ible, the &s;olemn warnings and predic|tions of the monk, &s;o frequently delivered, and &s;o faith|fully fulfilled, could have no connection with the &s;chemes of banditti. It appeared, therefore, that Vi|valdi
<PB N="113" REF="032735_0111_0FF46EBE6B51C860">
was not in the hands of robbers; or, if he were, that the monk, at lea&s;t, had no connection with them; yet it was certain that he had ju&s;t heard the voice of this monk beneath the arch; that his &s;ervant had &s;aid, he &s;aw the ve&s;tments of one a&s;cending the &s;teps of the fort; and that they had both rea&s;on, afterwards, to be|lieve it was his &s;hadowy figure, which they had pur&s;ued to the very chamber where they were now confined.</P>
<P>As Vivaldi con&s;idered all the&s;e circum&s;tances, his perplexity encrea&s;ed, and he was more than ever in|clined to believe, that the form, which had a&s;&s;umed the appearance of a monk, was &s;omething &s;uper-human.</P>
<P>"If this being had <HI>appeared only,"</HI> &s;aid he to him|&s;elf, "I &s;hould, perhaps, have thought it the perturbed &s;pirit of him, who doubtle&s;s has been murdered here, and that it led me hither to di&s;cover the deed, that his bones might be removed to holy ground; but this monk, or whatever it is, was neither &s;ilent, nor ap|parently anxious concerning him&s;elf; he &s;poke only of events connected with my peace, and predicted of the future, as well as reverted to the pa&s;t! If he had either hinted of him&s;elf, or had been wholly &s;ilent, his appearance, and manner of eluding pur&s;uit, is &s;o ex|traordinary, that I &s;hould have yielded, for once, per|haps, to the tales of our grandfathers, and thought he was the &s;pectre of a murdered per&s;on."</P>
<P>As Vivaldi expre&s;&s;ed his incredulity, however, he returned to examine the garment once more, when, as he rai&s;ed it, he ob&s;erved, what had before e&s;caped his notice, black drapery mingled with the heap beneath; and, on lifting this al&s;o on the point of his &s;word, he perceived part of the habiliment of a monk! He &s;tart|ed at the di&s;covery, as if he had &s;een the apparition, which had &s;o long been tempting his credulity. Here were the ve&s;t and &s;capulary, rent and &s;tained with blood! Having gazed for a moment, he let them drop
<PB N="114" REF="032735_0112_0FF46F3190F045F0">
upon the heap; when Paulo, who had been &s;ilently ob&s;erving him, exclaimed,</P>
<P>"Signor! that &s;hould be the garment of the demon who led us hither. Is it a winding-&s;heet for us, Mae&s;tro? Or was it one for the body he inhabited while on earth!"</P>
<P>"Neither, I tru&s;t," replied Vivaldi, endeavouring to command the perturbation he &s;uffered, and turning from the &s;pectacle; "therefore we will try once more to regain our liberty."</P>
<P>This was a de&s;ign, however, beyond his accompli&s;h|ment; and having again attacked the door, rai&s;ed Paulo to the grated window, and vociferated for re|lea&s;e with his utmo&s;t &s;trength, in which he was very ably &s;econded by Paulo, he abandoned for the pre&s;ent all further attempts, and, weary and de&s;ponding, threw him&s;elf on the ground of the dungeon.</P>
<P>Paulo bitterly lamented his ma&s;ter's ra&s;hne&s;s in pe|netrating to this remote &s;pot, and bewailed the proba|bility of their being fami&s;hed.</P>
<P>"For &s;uppo&s;ing, Signor, that we were not decoyed hither for plunder and butchery, and &s;uppo&s;ing that we are not &s;urrounded by malicious &s;pirits, which San Januarius forbid I &s;hould take upon me to affirm is impo&s;&s;ible! &s;uppo&s;ing all this, Signor, yet &s;till there remains almo&s;t a certainty of our being &s;tarved to death; for how is it po&s;&s;ible that any body can hear our cries, in a place &s;o remote from all re&s;ort, and bu|ried, as one may &s;ay, under ground as this is?"</P>
<P>"Thou art an excellent comforter," &s;aid Vivaldi, groaning.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t allow, Signor, that you are as excellent a conductor."</P>
<P>Vivaldi gave no an&s;wer, but lay on the ground, abandoned to agonizing thought. He had now lei&s;ure to con&s;ider the late words of the monk, and to con|jecture, for he was in a mood for conjecturing the
<PB N="115" REF="032735_0113_0FF46EC19BFCE6D8">
wor&s;t, that they not only alluded to Ellena, but that his &s;aying, "&s;he had departed an hour ago," was a figurative manner of telling that &s;he had died then. This was a conjecture which di&s;pelled almo&s;t all ap|prehen&s;ion for him&s;elf. He &s;tarted from the ground, and paced his pri&s;on with quick and unequal &s;teps; it was now no longer a heavy de&s;pondency that oppre&s;&s;ed him, but an acute anxiety that &s;tung him, and with the tortures of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, brought al&s;o that of pa&s;&s;ionate impatience and horror concerning the fate of Ellena. The longer he dwelt upon the po&s;&s;ibility of her death, the more probable it appeared. The monk had alrea|dy forewarned him of the death of Bianchi; and when he recollected the &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances which had attended it, his terrors for Ellena increa&s;ed. The more he yielded to his feelings, the more violent they became, till at length, his ungovernable impatience and apprehen&s;ions aro&s;e almo&s;t to frenzy.</P>
<P>Paulo forgot for a while his own &s;ituation in the &s;uperior &s;ufferings of his ma&s;ter, and now, at lea&s;t endeavoured to perform the offices of a comforter, for he tried to calm Vivaldi's mind, by &s;electing the faire&s;t circum&s;tances for hope which the &s;ubject admitted, and he pa&s;&s;ed without noticing, or, if noticing, only lightly touched upon the mo&s;t prominent po&s;&s;ibilities of evil. His ma&s;ter, however, was in&s;en&s;ible to all he &s;aid, till he mentioned again the convent del Pianto; and this &s;ubject, as it &s;eemed connected with the monk, who had hinted the fate of Ellena, intere&s;ted the un|happy Vivaldi, who withdrew awhile from his own reflection, to li&s;ten to a recital which might a&s;&s;i&s;t his conjectures.</P>
<P>Paulo complied with his command, but not without reluctance. He looked round the empty vault, as if he feared that &s;ome per&s;on might be lurking in the ob&s;cu|rity, who would overhear and even an&s;wer him.</P>
<P>"We are tolerably retired here too, Signor," &s;aid
<PB N="116" REF="032735_0114_0FF46F35067997C0">
he, recollecting him&s;elf; "one may venture to talk &s;ecrets with little danger of being di&s;covered. How|ever, Mae&s;tro, it is be&s;t to make matters quite &s;ure; and therefore, if you will plea&s;e to take a &s;eat on the ground, I will &s;tand be&s;ide you and relate all I know of the convent of <HI>Our Lady of Tears,</HI> which is not much after all."</P>
<P>Vivaldi having &s;eated him&s;elf, and bidden Paulo do the &s;ame, the &s;ervant began in a low voice&mdash;"It was on the vigil of the Santo Marco, ju&s;t after the la&s;t ve&s;per-bell had tolled&mdash;You never was at the Santa Maria del Pianto, Signor, or you would know what a gloomy old church it has&mdash;It was in a confe&s;&s;ional in one of the &s;ide ailes of this church, and ju&s;t after the la&s;t bell had cea&s;ed, that a per&s;on, &s;o muffled up that neither &s;hape nor face could be di&s;tingui&s;hed, came and placed him&s;elf on the &s;teps of one of the boxes adjoining the confe&s;&s;ional chair; but if he had been as airily dre&s;&s;ed as your&s;elf, Signor, he might have been ju&s;t as well concealed; for the du&s;ky aile is light|ed only by one lamp, which hangs at the end next the painted window, except when the tapers at the &s;hrine of San Antonio happen to be burning at the other extremity, and even then the place is almo&s;t as gloomy as this vault. But that is, no doubt contrived for the purpo&s;e, that people may not blu&s;h for the &s;ins they confe&s;s; and in good faith, this is an accommodation which may bring more money to the poors' box, for the monks have a &s;hrewd eye that way, and"&mdash;</P>
<P>"You have dropt the thread of your &s;tory," &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"True, Signor, let me recollect where I lo&s;t it&mdash;Oh! at the &s;teps of the confe&s;&s;ional:&mdash;the &s;tranger knelt down upon them, and for &s;ome time poured &s;uch groans into the ear of the confe&s;&s;or, as were heard all along the aile.

Penitents; and people who have more than ordinary &s;ins to confe&s;s, &s;ometimes go there, to con&s;ult with the grand penitentiary him&s;elf, what is to be done. Now it happened that Father An&s;aldo, the grand peniten|tiary him&s;elf was in the chair, as is cu&s;tomary on the vigil of the Santo Marco; and he gently reproved the penitent for bewailing &s;o loud, and bade him take comfort; when the other replied only by a groan deeper than before, but it was not &s;o loud, and then proceeded to confe&s;s. But what he did confe&s;s, Sig|nor, I know not; for the confe&s;&s;or, you know, never mu&s;t divulge, except, indeed, on very extraordinary occa&s;ions. It was, however, &s;omething &s;o very &s;trange and horrible, that the grand penitentiary &s;uddenly quit|ted the chair, and before he reached the cloi&s;ters he fell into &s;trong convul&s;ions. On recovering him&s;elf, he a&s;ked the people about him, whether the penitent who had vi&s;ited &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ional, naming it, was gone; adding, that if he was &s;till in the church, it was proper he &s;hould be detained. He de&s;cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, at the &s;ame time, as well as he could, the &s;ort of figure he had dimly &s;een approaching the confe&s;&s;ional ju&s;t before he had received the confe&s;&s;ion, at recollecting which, he &s;eemed ready to go off again into his convul&s;ions. One of the fathers, who had cro&s;&s;ed the aile on his way to the cloi&s;ters, upon the fir&s;t alarm of An&s;aldo's di&s;|order, remembered that a per&s;on, &s;uch as was de&s;cribed, had pa&s;&s;ed him ha&s;tily. He had &s;een a tall figure, muffled up in the habit of a white friar, gliding &s;wiftly along the aile, towards the door that opened into the outer door of the convent; but he was him&s;elf too much engaged to notice the &s;tranger particularly. Father An&s;aldo thought this mu&s;t be the per&s;on; and the porter was &s;ummoned, and a&s;ked whether he had ob&s;erved &s;uch an one pa&s;s. He affirmed that he had not &s;een any per&s;on go forth from the gate within the la&s;t quarter of an hour; which might be true enough,
<PB N="118" REF="032735_0116_0FF46F38ADF54A10">
you know, Signor, if the rogue had been off his po&s;t. But he further &s;aid, that no one had entered, during the whole evening, habited in white, as the &s;tranger was de&s;cribed to be: &s;o the porter proved him&s;elf to be a vigilant watchman; for he mu&s;t have been a&s;leep too, or how could this per&s;onage have entered the con|vent, and left it again, without being &s;een by him!"</P>
<P>"In white, was he?" &s;aid Vivaldi; "if he had been in black, I &s;hould have thought this mu&s;t have been the monk my tormentor."</P>
<P>"Why, you know, Signor, that occurred to me before," ob&s;erved Paulo, "and a man might ea&s;ily change his dre&s;s if that were all."</P>
<P>"Proceed," &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Hearing this account from the porter," continued Paulo, "the Fathers believed one and all, that the &s;tranger mu&s;t be &s;ecreted within the walls; and the convent, with every part of the precincts, was &s;earch|ed; but no per&s;on was found!"</P>
<P>"This mu&s;t certainly be the monk," &s;aid Vivaldi, notwith&s;tanding the difference of his habit; there &s;urely cannot be two beings in the world, who would conduct them&s;elves in this &s;ame my&s;terious manner!"</P>
<P>He was interrupted by a low &s;ound, which &s;eemed to his di&s;tracted fancy, to proceed from a dying per&s;on. Paulo al&s;o heard it; he &s;tarted, and they both li&s;tened with inten&s;e and almo&s;t intolerable expectation.</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid Paulo at length, "it was only the wind.</P>

<P>"Be &s;till" &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>They li&s;tened attentively, and heard a murmuring as of voices; but could not a&s;certain whether they came from the adjacent vault, or aro&s;e from beneath the one in which they were. The &s;ound returned at intervails; and the per&s;ons who conver&s;ed, whatever they were, &s;eemingly re&s;trained their voices, as if they feared to be heard. Vivaldi con&s;idered whether it were better to di&s;cover him&s;elf, and call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or to remain &s;till.</P>
<P>"Remember, Signor," &s;aid Paulo, "what a chance we have of being &s;tarved, unle&s;s we venture to di&s;co|ver our&s;elves to the&s;e people or whatever they are."</P>
<P>"Venture!" exclaimed Vivaldi. "What has &s;uch a wretch as I to do with fear? O, Ellena, Ellena!"</P>
<P>He in&s;tantly called loudly to the per&s;on whom he believed he had heard, and was &s;econded by Paulo; but thier continued vociferations availed them nothing; no an&s;wer was returned; and even the indi&s;tinct &s;ounds, which had awakened their attention, were heard no more.</P>
<P>Exhau&s;ted by their efforts, they laid down on the floor of the dungeon, abandoning all further attempts at e&s;cape till the morning light might a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>Vivaldi had no further &s;pirits to enquire for the re|mainder of Paulo's narrative.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>DURING &s;everal days after Ellena's arrival at the mona&s;tery of San Stefano, &s;he was not permitted to leave the room. The door was locked upon her, and not any per&s;on appeared except the nun, who brought her a &s;canty portion of food, and who was the &s;ame, that had fir&s;t admitted her into that part of the convent appropriated to the abbe&s;s.</P>
<P>On the fourth-day, when, probably, it was believed that her &s;pirits were &s;ubdued by confinement, and by her experience of the &s;uffering &s;he had to expect from re&s;idence, &s;he was &s;ummoned to the parlour. The ab|be&s;s was alone, and the air of au&s;terity, with which &s;he regarded Ellena, prepared the latter to endure.</P>
<P>After an exordium on the heniou&s;ne&s;s of her offence and the ne&s;&s;e&s;&s;ity there was for taking mea&s;ures to pro|tect the peace and dignity of a noble family, which her late conduct had nearly de&s;troyed; the abbe&s;s infor|med her, that &s;he mu&s;t determine either to accept the veil, or the per&s;onwhom the Marche&s;a di Vivaldi had, of her great goodne&s;s, &s;elected for her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>"You never can be &s;ufficiently grateful," added the abbe&s;s, "for the genero&s;ity the Marche&s;a di&s;plays, in allowing you a choice on the &s;ubject. After the in|jury you have endeavored to inflict upon her and her family, you could not expect that any indulgence would be &s;hewn you. It was natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Marche&s;a would puni&s;h you with &s;everity; in&s;tead of which, &s;he allows you to enter into our &s;ociety; or, if
<PB N="121" REF="032735_0119_0FF46EF502F21EB0">
you have not &s;trength of mind &s;ufficient to enable you to renounce a &s;inful world, &s;he permits you to return into it, and gives you a &s;uitable partner to &s;upport you through its cares and toils,&mdash;a partner much more &s;uitable to your circum&s;tances than him, to whom you had the temerity to lift your eye."</P>
<P>Ellena blu&s;hed at this coar&s;e appeal to her pride, and per&s;evered in a di&s;dainful &s;ilence. Thus to give inju&s;|tice the colouring of mercy, and to acts mo&s;t ab&s;olute|ly tyrannical the &s;oftening tints of genero&s;ity, excited her hone&s;t indignation. She was not, however, &s;hoc|ked by a di&s;covery of the de&s;igns formed again&s;t her, &s;ince, from the moment of her arrival at San Stefano, &s;he had expected &s;omething terribly &s;evere, and had, prepared her mind to meet it with fortitude; for &s;he believed, that, &s;o &s;upported, &s;he &s;hould weary the ma|lice of her enemies, and finally triumph over misfor|tune. It was only when &s;he thought of Vivaldi that her courage failed, and that the injuries &s;he endured &s;eem too heavy to be long &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>"You are &s;ilent!" &s;aid the abbe&s;s, after a pau&s;e of expectation. "Is it po&s;&s;ible, then, that you can be un|grateful for the genero&s;ity of the Marche&s;a? But, though you may at pre&s;ent be in&s;en&s;ible to her good|ne&s;s, I will forbear to take advantage of your indi&s;cre|tion, and will &s;till allow you liberty of choice.

<P>"It is unnece&s;&s;ary," &s;aid Ellena, with an air of dig|nified tranquility, "that I &s;hould withdraw for the pur|po&s;es of con&s;idering and deciding. My re&s;olution is already taken, and I reject each of the offered alterna|tives. I will neither condemn my&s;elf to a cloi&s;ter, or

to the degradation, with which I am threatened on the other hand. Having &s;aid this, I am prepared to meet whatever &s;uffering you &s;hall inflict upon me; but be a&s;&s;ured, that my own voice never &s;hall &s;anction the e|vils to which I may be &s;ubjected, and that the immor|tal love of ju&s;tice which fills all my heart, will &s;u&s;tain my courage no le&s;s powerfully than the &s;en&s;e of what is due to my own character. You are now acquaint|ed with my &s;entiments and my re&s;olutions; I &s;hall re|peat them no more."</P>
<P>The abbe&s;s, who&s;e &s;urpri&s;e had thus long &s;uffered Ellena to &s;peak, &s;till fixed upon her a &s;tern regard, as &s;he &s;aid, "Where is it that you have learned the&s;e heroics, and acquired the ra&s;hne&s;s which thus prompts you to avow them!&mdash;the boldne&s;s which enables you to in&s;ult your &s;uperior, a prie&s;te&s;s of your holy reli|gion, even in her &s;anctuary!"</P>
<P>"The &s;anctuary is prophaned," &s;aid Ellena, mildly, but with dignity: "it is become a pri&s;on. It is only when the &s;uperior cea&s;es to re&s;pect the precepts of that holy religion, the precepts which teach her ju&s;tice and benevolence, that &s;he her&s;elf is no longer re&s;pected.&mdash;The very &s;entiment which bids us revere its mild and beneficent laws, bids us al&s;o reject the violators of them: when you command me to reverence my reli|gion, you urge me to condemn your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Withdraw!" &s;aid the abbe&s;s, ri&s;ing impatiently from her chair; "your admonition, &s;o becomingly de|livered, &s;hall not be forgotten."</P>
<P>Ellena willingly obeyed, and was led back to her cell, where &s;he &s;at down pen&s;ively, and reviewed her conduct. Her judgment approved of the frankne&s;s, with which &s;he had a&s;&s;erted her rights, and of the firm|ne&s;s, with which &s;he had reproved a woman, who had dared to demand re&s;pect from the very victim of her cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion. She was the more &s;atis|fied with her&s;elf, becau&s;e &s;he had never, for an in&s;tant,
<PB N="123" REF="032735_0121_0FF46EF6AAD652E8">
forgotten her own dignity &s;o far, as to degenerate into the vehemence of pa&s;&s;ion, or to faulter with the weak|ne&s;s of fear. Her conviction of the abbe&s;s's unworthy character was too clear to allow Ellena to feel aba&s;h|ed in her pre&s;ence; for &s;he regarded only the cen&s;ure of the good, to which &s;he had ever been tremblingly alive, as &s;he was obdurately in&s;en&s;ible to that of the vicious.</P>
<P>Ellena, having now a&s;&s;erted her re&s;olutions, deter|mined to avoid, if po&s;&s;ible, all repetition of &s;cenes like the la&s;t, and to repel, by &s;ilence only, whatever indig|nity might be offered her. She knew that &s;he mu&s;t &s;uffer, and &s;he re&s;olved to endure. Of the three evils, which were placed before her, that of confinement, with all its melancholy accompaniments, appeared con&s;iderably le&s;s &s;evere than either the threatened mar|riage, or a formal renunciation of the world; either of which would devote her, during life, to mi&s;ery, and that by her own act. Her choice, therefore, had been ea&s;y, and the way was plain before her. If &s;he could endure with calmne&s;s the hard&s;hips which &s;he could not avoid, half their weight would be unfelt; and &s;he now mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly endeavoured to attain the &s;trength of mind, which was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport &s;uch equanimity.</P>
<P>For &s;everal days after the late interview with the abbe&s;s, &s;he was kept a clo&s;e pri&s;oner; but on the fifth evening &s;he was permitted to attend ve&s;pers. As &s;he walked through the garden to the chapel, the ordinary fre&s;hne&s;s of the open air, and the verdure of the trees and &s;hrubs were luxuries to her, who had &s;o long been re&s;tricted from the common ble&s;&s;ings of nature. She followed the nuns to a chapel where they u&s;ually performed their devotions, and was there &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ated among the novices. The &s;olemnity of the &s;ervice, and par|ticularly of tho&s;e parts, which were accompanied by mu&s;ic, touched all her heart, and &s;oothed and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">levated her &s;pirit.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="032735_0122_0FF46F419632F008">
Among the voices of the choir, was one who&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ion immediately fixed her attention; it &s;eemed to &s;peak a loftier &s;entiment of devotion than the others, and to be modulated by the melancholy of an heart, that had long &s;ince taken leave of this world. Whe|ther it &s;welled with the high peal of the organ, or mingled in low and trembling accents with the &s;ink|ing chorus, Ellena felt that &s;he under&s;tood all the feel|ings of the brea&s;t from which it flowed; and &s;he look|ed to the gallery where the nuns were a&s;&s;embled, to di&s;cover a countenance, that might &s;eem to accord with the &s;en&s;ibility expre&s;&s;ed in the voice. As no &s;trangers were admitted to the chapel, &s;ome of the &s;i&s;ters had thrown back their veils, and &s;he &s;aw little that intere&s;ted her in their various faces; but the figure and attitude of a nun, kneeling in a remote part of the gallery, beneath a lamp, which threw its rays a&s;lant her head, perfectly agreed with the idea &s;he had formed of the &s;inger, and the &s;ound &s;eemed to ap|proach immediately from that direction. Her face was concealed by a black veil, who&s;e tran&s;parency, however, permitted the fairne&s;s of her complexion to appear; but the air of her head, and the &s;ingularity of her attitude, for &s;he was the only per&s;on who remain|ed kneeling, &s;ufficiently indicated the &s;uperior degree of fervency and penitence, which the voice had ex|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>When the hymn had cea&s;ed &s;he ro&s;e from her knees, and Ellena, &s;oon after, ob&s;erved her throw back her veil, di&s;covered, by the lamp, which &s;hed its full light upon her features, a countenance that in&s;tantly con|firmed her conjecture. It was touched with a me|lancholy kind of re&s;ignation; yet grief &s;eemed &s;till to occa&s;ion the palene&s;s, and the air of languor, that pre|vailed over it, and which di&s;appeared only when the momentary energy of devotion &s;eemed to lift her &s;pirit above this world, and to impart to it &s;omewhat of a
<PB N="125" REF="032735_0123_0FF46EF8A58C1F20">
&s;eraphic grandeur. At tho&s;e moments her blue eyes were rai&s;ed towards Heaven, with &s;uch meek, yet fer|vent love, &s;uch &s;ublime enthu&s;ia&s;m as the heads of Guido &s;ometimes di&s;play, and which renewed with Ellena, all the enchanting effects of the voice &s;he had ju&s;t heard.</P>
<P>While &s;he regarded the nun with a degree of inter|e&s;t which rendered her in&s;en&s;ible to every other object in the chapel, &s;he fancied &s;he could perceive the calm|ne&s;s in her countenance to be that of de&s;pair, rather than of re&s;ignation; for, when her thoughts were not elevated in prayer, there was frequently a fixedne&s;s in her look, too energetic for common &s;uffering, or for the temper of mind which may lead to perfect re&s;ig|nation. It had, however, much that attached the &s;ympathy of Ellena, and much that &s;eemed to &s;peak a &s;imilarity of feeling. Ellena was not only &s;oothed, but in &s;ome degree comforted, whil&s;t &s;he gazed upon her; a &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s which may, perhaps, be pardoned, when it is con&s;idered, that &s;he thus knew there was one human being, at lea&s;t, in the convent, who mu&s;t be capable of feeling pity, and willing to admini&s;ter con&s;olation. Ellena endeavoured to meet her eye, that &s;he might inform her of the regard &s;he had in|&s;pired, and expre&s;s her own happine&s;s; but the nun was &s;o entirely engaged by devotion, that &s;he did not &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>As they left the chapel, however, the nun pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by Ellena, who threw back her veil, and fixed upon her a look &s;o &s;upplicating and expre&s;&s;ive, that the nun pau&s;ed, and in her turn regarded the novice, not with &s;urpri&s;e only, but with a mixture of curio&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion. A faint bru&s;h cro&s;&s;ed her cheek, her &s;pirits &s;eemed to faulter, and &s;he was unwilling to withdraw her eyes from Ellena: but it was nece&s;&s;ary that &s;he &s;hould continue in the proce&s;&s;ion, and, bidding her farewel by a &s;mile of ineffable pity, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed on
<PB N="126" REF="032735_0124_0FF46F45A2AD3280">
to the court, while Ellena followed with attention &s;till fixed upon the &s;i&s;ter, who &s;oon di&s;appeared beyond the doorway of the Abbe&s;s's apartment, and Ellena had nearly reached her own, before her thoughts were &s;ufficiently di&s;engaged to permit her to enquire the name of the &s;tranger.</P>
<P>"It is &s;i&s;ter Olivia whom you mean, perhaps," &s;aid her conductre&s;s.</P>
<P>"She is very hand&s;ome," &s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P>"Many of the &s;i&s;ters are &s;o," replied Margaritone, with an air of pique.</P>
<P>"Undoubtedly," &s;aid Ellena; "but &s;he, whom I mean, has a mo&s;t touching countenance; frank, noble, full of &s;en&s;ibility; and there is a gentle melancholy in her eye, which can not but intere&s;t all who ob&s;erve her."</P>
<P>Ellena was &s;o fa&s;cinated by this intere&s;ting nun, that &s;he forgot &s;he was de&s;cribing her to a per&s;on, who&s;e callous heart rendered her in&s;en&s;ible to the in|fluence of any countenance, except, perhaps, the com|manding one of the lady abbe&s;s; and to whom, there|fore, a de&s;cription of the fine traits, which Ellena felt, was as unintelligible as would have been an A|rabic in&s;cription.</P>
<P>"She is pa&s;&s;ed the bloom of youth," continued Ellena, &s;till anxious to be under&s;tood; "but &s;he re|tains all its intere&s;ting graces, and adds to them the dignity of"&mdash;</P>
<P>"If you mean that &s;he is of middle age," interrupted Margaritone, peevi&s;hly, "it is &s;i&s;ter Olivia you men|tion, for we are all younger than &s;he is."</P>
<P>Ellena, rai&s;ing her eyes almo&s;t uncon&s;ciou&s;ly, as the nun &s;poke this, fixed them upon a face &s;allow, mea|gre, &s;eemingly near fifty years an inhabitant of this world; and &s;he could &s;carcely &s;uppre&s;s the &s;urpri&s;e &s;he felt, on perceiving &s;uch wretched vanity lingering among the chilled pa&s;&s;ions of &s;o repul&s;ive a frame, and within the &s;eque&s;tered &s;hade of a cloi&s;ter, Margari|tone,
<PB N="127" REF="032735_0125_0FF46EFDE6BC5220">
&s;till jealous of the prai&s;e be&s;towed on Olivia, repelled all further enquiry, and, having attended El|lena to her cell, locked her up for the night.</P>
<P>On the following evening Ellena was again per|mitted to attend ve&s;pers, and, on the way to the cha|pel, the hope of &s;eeing her intere&s;ting favourite re|animated her &s;pirits. In the &s;ame part of the gallery, as on the preceding night, &s;he again appeared, and kneeling, as before, beneath the lamp, in private ori|&s;on, for the &s;ervice was not begun.</P>
<P>Ellena endeavoured to &s;ubdue the impatience &s;he felt to expre&s;s her regard, and to be noticed by the holy &s;i&s;ter, till &s;he &s;hould have fini&s;hed. When the nun ro&s;e, and ob&s;erved Ellena, &s;he lifted her veil, and, fixing on her the &s;ame enquiring eye, her countenance brightened into a &s;mile &s;o full of compa&s;&s;ion and in|telligence, that Ellena, forgetting the decorums of the place, left her &s;eat to approach her; it &s;eemed as if the &s;oul, which beamed forth in that &s;mile, had long been acquainted with hers. As &s;he advanced, the nun dropped her veil, a reproof which &s;he immediately under&s;tood, and &s;he withdrew to her &s;eat; but her at|tention remained fixed on the nun during the whole &s;ervice.</P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion, when they left the chapel, and &s;he &s;aw Olivia pa&s;s without noticing her, Ellena could &s;carcely re&s;train her tears; &s;he returned in deep de|jection to her room. The regard of this n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n was not only delightful, but &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to her heart, and &s;he dwelt, with fond per&s;everance, on the &s;mile that had expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much, and which threw one gleam of comfort, even through the bars of her pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Her reveries was &s;oon interrupted by a light &s;tep, that approached her cell, and in the next moment the door was unlocked, and Olivia her&s;elf appeared. El|lena ro&s;e with emotion to meet her; the nun held forth her hand to receive hers.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="032735_0126_0FF46F478CF3EEE8">
"You are unu&s;ed to confinement," &s;aid &s;he, curt&s;y|ing mournfully, and placing on the table a little ba&s;ket containing refre&s;hment, "and our hard fare"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand you," &s;aid Ellena, with a look ex|pre&s;&s;ive of her gratitude; "you have a heart that can pity, though you inhabit the&s;e walls; you have &s;uffer|ed too and know the delicate genero&s;ity of &s;oftening the &s;orrows of others, by any attention that may tell them your &s;ympathy. O! if I could expre&s;s how much the &s;en&s;e of this affects me!"</P>
<P>Tears interrupted her. Olivia pre&s;&s;ed her hand, looked &s;teadily upon her face, and was &s;omewhat agi|tated, but &s;he &s;oon recovered apparent tranquillity, and &s;aid, with a &s;erious &s;mile, "You judge rightly, my &s;i&s;ter, re&s;pecting my &s;entiments, however you may do concerning my &s;ufferings. My heart is not in&s;en&s;ible to pity, nor to you my child. You were de&s;igned for happier days than you can hope to find within the&s;e cloi&s;ters!"</P>
<P>She checked her&s;elf as if &s;he had allowed too much, and then added, "But you may, perhaps, be peaceful; and &s;ince it con&s;oles you to know you have a friend near you, believe me that friend&mdash;but believe it in &s;i|lence. I will vi&s;it you when I am permitted&mdash;but do not enquire for me; and if my vi&s;its are &s;hort, do not pre&s;s me to lengthen them."</P>
<P>"How good is this!" &s;aid Ellena, in a faultering voice. "How &s;weet too it is! you will vi&s;it me, and I am pitied by you!"</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h!" &s;aid the nun, expre&s;&s;ively; "no more; I may be ob&s;erved. Good night, my &s;i&s;ter; may your &s;lumbers be light!"</P>
<P>Ellena's heart &s;unk. She had not &s;pirits to &s;ay, "Good night!" but her eyes, covered with tears, &s;aid more. The nun turned her own away &s;uddenly, and, pre&s;&s;ing her hand in &s;ilence, left the cell. Ellena, firm and tranquil under the in&s;ults of the abbe&s;s, was now
<PB N="129" REF="032735_0127_0FF46F008397F7B8">
melted into tears by the kindne&s;s of a friend. The&s;e gentle tears were refre&s;hing to her long oppre&s;&s;ed &s;pi|rits, and &s;he indulged them. Of Vivaldi &s;he thought with more compo&s;ure than &s;he had done &s;ince &s;he left the villa Alti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ri; and &s;omething like hope began to re|vive in her heart, though reflection offered nothing to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>On the following morning, &s;he perceived that the door of her cell had not been clo&s;ed. She ro&s;e im|patiently, and, not without a hope of liberty, immedi|ately pa&s;&s;ed it. The cell opening upon a &s;hort pa&s;|&s;age, which communicated with the main building, and which was &s;hut up by a door, was &s;ecluded, and almo&s;t in&s;ulated from every other chamber; and this door being now &s;ecured, Ellena was as trully a pri&s;oner as before. It appeared then, that the nun had omitted to fa&s;ten the cell only for the purpo&s;e of allowing her more &s;pace to walk in the pa&s;&s;age, and &s;he was grate|ful for the attention. Still more &s;he was &s;o, when, having traver&s;ed it, &s;he perceived one extremity terminate in a narrow &s;tair-ca&s;e, that appeared to lead to other chambers.</P>
<P>She a&s;cended the winding &s;teps ha&s;tily, and found they led only to a door, opening into a &s;mall room, where nothing remarkable appeared, till &s;he approach|ed the windows, and beh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ld thence an horizon, and a land&s;cape &s;pread below, who&s;e grandeur awakened all her heart. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her pri&s;on was lo&s;t, while her eyes ranged over the wide and freely &s;ublime &s;cene without. She p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rceived that this cham|ber was within a &s;mall turret, projecting from an an|gle of the convent over the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ls, and &s;u&s;pended, as in air, above the va&s;t precipices of granite, that formed part of the mountain.

<PB N="130" REF="032735_0128_0FF46F4C12CB95A0">
Ellena, with a dreadful plea&s;ure, looked down them, &s;hagged as they were with larch, and frequently darkened by lines of gigantic pine bending along the rocky ledges, till her eye re&s;ted on the thick che&s;nut woods that extended over their winding ba&s;e, and which &s;oftening to the plains, &s;eemed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orm a grada|tion between the variegated cultivation there, and the awful wildne&s;s of the rocks above. Round the&s;e ex|ten&s;ive plains were tumbled the mountains, of various &s;hape and attitude, which Ellena had admired on her approach to San Stefano; &s;ome &s;haded with fore&s;ts of olive and almond trees, but the greater part abandon|ed to the flocks, which, in &s;ummer, feed on their aro|matic herbage, and on the approach of winter, de&s;cend to the &s;heltered plains of the <HI>Tavogliere di Puglia.</HI></P>
<P>On the left opened the dreadful pa&s;s which &s;he had traver&s;ed, and the thunder of who&s;e waters now mur|mured at a di&s;tance. The accumulation of over-top|ping points, which the mountains of this dark per|&s;pective exhibited, pre&s;ented an image of grandeur &s;u|perior to any thing &s;he had &s;een while within the pa&s;s it&s;elf.</P>
<P>To Ellena, who&s;e mind was capable of being highly elevated, or &s;weetly &s;oothed, by &s;cenes of nature, the di&s;covery of this little turret was an important circum|&s;tance. Hither &s;he could come, and her &s;oul, refre&s;h|ed by the views it afforded, would acquire &s;trength to bear her with equanimity, through the per&s;ecutions that might await her. Here, gazing up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n the &s;tu|pendous imagery around her, looking, as it were, be|yond the awful veil which ob&s;cures the features of the Deity, and conceals Him from the eyes of his crea|tures, dwelling as with a pre&s;ent God in the mid&s;t of his &s;ublime works; with a mind thus elevated, how in&s;ignificant would appear to her the tran&s;actions, and the &s;ufferings of this world! How poor the boa&s;ted power of man, when the fall of a &s;ingle cliff from the&s;e

mountains would with ea&s;e de&s;troy thou&s;ands of his race a&s;&s;embled on the plains below! How would it avail them, that they were accoutred for battle, armed with all the in&s;truments of de&s;truction that human in|vention ever fa&s;hioned? Thus man, the giant who now held her in captivity, would &s;hrink to the dimi|nutivene&s;s of a fairy; and &s;he would experience, that his utmo&s;t force was unable to enchain her &s;oul, or compel her to fear him, while he was de&s;titute of virtue.</P>
<P>Ellena's attention was recalled from the &s;cene with|out by a &s;ound from within the gallery, and &s;he then heard a key turning in the door of the pa&s;&s;age. Fear|ing that it was &s;i&s;ter Margaritone who approached, and who, informed by her ab&s;ence of the con&s;olatory turret &s;he had di&s;covered, would perhaps debar her from ever returning to it, Ellena de&s;cended with a pal|pitating heart, and found that nun in the cell. Sur|pri&s;e and &s;everity were in her countenance, when &s;he enquired by what means Ellena had unlocked the door, and whether &s;he had been.</P>
<P>Ellena an&s;wered without any prevarication, that &s;he had found the door unfa&s;tened, and that &s;he had vi&s;it|ed the turret above; but &s;he forebore to expre&s;s a wi&s;h to return thither, judging that &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion would certainly exclude her in future. Margaritone, after &s;harply rebuking her for prying beyond the pa&s;|&s;age, and &s;etting down the breakfa&s;t &s;he had brought, left the room, the door of which &s;he did not forget to &s;ecure. Thus Ellena was at once deprived of &s;o in|nocent a means of con&s;olation as her plea&s;ant turret had afforded.</P>
<P>During &s;everal days, &s;he &s;aw only the au&s;tere nun, except when &s;he attended ve&s;pers; where, however, &s;he was &s;o vigilantly ob&s;erved, that &s;he feared to &s;peak with Olivia, even by h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> eyes.

<PB N="132" REF="032735_0130_0FF46F4E99DEB9F8">
which Ellena, when &s;he did venture to look at her, could not perfectly interpret. It was not only of pity, but of anxious curio&s;ity, and of &s;omething al&s;o like fear. A blu&s;h would &s;ometimes wander over her cheek, which was &s;ucceeded by an extreme palene&s;s, and by an air of &s;uch univer&s;al langour as precedes a fainting fit: but the exerci&s;es of devotion &s;eemed fre|quently to recal her fleeting &s;pirits, and to elevate them with hope and courage.</P>
<P>When &s;he left the chapel, Ellena &s;aw Olivia no more that night; but on the following morning &s;he came with breakfa&s;t to the cell. A character of pecu|liar &s;adne&s;s was on her brow.</P>
<P>"O! how glad I am to &s;ee you!" &s;aid Ellena&punc; "and how much I have regretted your long ab&s;ence! I was obliged to remember con&s;tantly what you had enjoined, to forbear enquiring after you."</P>
<P>The nun replied with a melancholly &s;mile, "I am come in obedience to our lady abbe&s;s," &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf on Ellena's mattre&s;s.</P>
<P>"And did you not wi&s;h to come?" &s;aid Ellena, mournfully.</P>
<P>"I did wi&s;h it," replied Olivia; "but"&mdash;and &s;he he&s;itated.</P>
<P>"Whence then this reluctance?" enquired Ellena Olivia was &s;ilent a moment.</P>
<P>"You are a me&s;&s;enger of evil news!" &s;aid Ellena; "you are only reluctant to afflict me."</P>
<P>"It is as you &s;ay," replied Olivia; "I am only reluc|tant to afflict you; and I fear you have too many at|tachments to the world, to allow you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o receive, with|out &s;orrow, what I have to communicate. I am or|dered to prepare you for the vows, and to &s;ay, that &s;ince you have rejected the hu&s;band which was pro|po&s;ed to you, you are to accept the veil; that many of the cu&s;tomary forms are to be di&s;pen&s;ed with; and that the ceremony of taking the black veil, will follow without delay that of receiving the white one."</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="032735_0131_0FF46F0425955E50">
The nun pau&s;ed; and Ellena &s;aid, "You are an un|willing bearer of this cruel me&s;&s;age; and I reply only to the lady abbe&s;s, when I declare, that I never will accept either; that force may &s;end me to the altar, but that it never &s;hall compel me to utter vows which my heart abhors; and if I am con&s;trained to appear there, it &s;hall be only to prote&s;t again&s;t her tyranny, and again&s;t the form intended to &s;anction it."</P>
<P>To Olivia this an&s;wer was &s;o far from being di&s;|plea&s;ing, that it appeared to give her &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>"I dare not applaud your re&s;olution," &s;aid &s;he; "but I will not condemn it. You have, no doubt, connections in the world which would render a &s;eclu|&s;ion from it afflicting. You have relations, friends, from whom it would be dreadful to part?"</P>
<P>"I have neither," &s;aid Ellena, &s;ighing.</P>
<P>"No! Can that be po&s;&s;ible? and yet you are &s;o unwilling to retire!"</P>
<P>"I have only one friend," replied Ellena, "and it is of him they would deprive me!"</P>
<P>"Pardon, my love, the abruptne&s;s of the&s;e enqui|ries," &s;aid Olivia; "yet, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; I entreat your for|givene&s;s, I am inclined to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> again, and to a&s;k your name."</P>
<P>"That is a que&s;tion I will readily an&s;wer. My name is Ellena di Ro&s;alba."</P>
<P>"How?" &s;aid Olivia, with an air of deliberation; "Ellena di"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Di Ro&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lba," repeated her companion; "and per|mit me to a&s;k your motive for the enquiry; do you know any per&s;on of my name?"</P>
<P>"No," replied the nun, mournfully: "but your fea|tures have &s;ome re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of a friend I once had."</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;aid this, her agitation was apparent, and &s;he aro&s;e to go. "I mu&s;t not lengthen my vi&s;it, le&s;t I &s;hould be forbidden to repeat it," &s;aid &s;he. "What

I am, per|haps, better acquainted with her character than you are; and O, my &s;i&s;ter! I would not &s;ee you pining away your exi&s;tence in this &s;olitary cell."</P>
<P>"How much am I obliged by the intere&s;t you ex|pre&s;s for my welfare," &s;aid Ellena, "and by the ad|vice you offer! I will yield my judgment in this in&s;tance to yours; you &s;hall modulate my refu&s;al as you think proper: but remember that it mu&s;t be ab&s;olute: and beware, le&s;t the abbe&s;s &s;hould mi&s;take gentlene&s;s for irre&s;olution."</P>
<P>"Tru&s;t me, I will be cautious in all that relates to you," &s;aid Olivia. "Farewel! I will vi&s;it you, if po&s;&s;ible, in the evening. In the mean time the door &s;hall be left open, that you may have more air and pro&s;pect than this cell affords. That &s;tairca&s;e leads to a plea&s;ant chamber."</P>
<P>"I have vi&s;ited it already," replied Ellena, "and have to thank you for the goodne&s;s which permitted me to do &s;o. To go thither will greatly &s;oothe my &s;pirits; if I had &s;ome book, and my drawing-in&s;tru|ments, I could almo&s;t forget my &s;orrows there."</P>
<P>"Could you &s;o?" &s;aid the nun, with an affectionate &s;mile. "Adieu! I will endeavour to &s;ee you in the evening. If &s;i&s;ter Margaritone returns, be careful not to enquire for me; nor once a&s;k her for the little indulgence I give you."</P>
<P>Olivia withdraw, and Ellena retired to the chamber above, where &s;he lo&s;t for a while all &s;en&s;e of &s;orrow amid&s;t the great &s;cenery, which its window exhi|bited.</P>
<P>At noon, the &s;tep of Margaritone &s;ummoned Ellena from her retreat, and &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed that no reproof followed this &s;econd di&s;covery of her ab&s;ence. Mar|garitone only &s;aid, that the abbe&s;s had the goodne&s;s to
<PB N="135" REF="032735_0133_0FF46F08EE4F87A0">
permit Ellena to dine with the novices, and that &s;he came to conduct her to their table.</P>
<P>Ellena did not rejoice in this permi&s;&s;ion, preferring to remain in her &s;olitary turret, to the being expo&s;ed to the examining eyes of &s;trangers; and &s;he followed dejectedly, through the &s;ilent pa&s;&s;ages to the apart|ment where they were a&s;&s;embled. She was not l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed than embarra&s;&s;ed to ob&s;erve, in the manners of young people re&s;iding in a convent, an ab&s;ence of that decorum, which includes beneath its mode&s;t &s;hade every grace that ought to adorn the female character, like the veil which gives dignity to their air and &s;oft|ne&s;s to their features. When Ellena entered the room, the eyes of the whole company were immediately fix|ed upon her; the young ladies began to whi&s;per and &s;mile, and &s;hewed, by various means, that &s;he was the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation, not otherwi&s;e than cen&s;orious. No one advanced to meet and to encourage her, to wel|come her to the table, or &s;till le&s;s di&s;play one of tho&s;e namele&s;s graces, with which a generous and delicate mind delights to re-animate the mode&s;t and the un|fortunate.</P>
<P>Ellena took a chair in &s;ilence; and, though &s;he had at fir&s;t felt forlorn and embarra&s;&s;ed by the impertinent manners of her companions, a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of inno|cence gradually revived her &s;pirits, and enabled her to re&s;ume an air of dignity, which repre&s;&s;ed this rude pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>Ellena returned to her cell, for the fir&s;t time, with eagerne&s;s. Margaritone did not fa&s;ten the door of it, but &s;he was careful to &s;ecure that of the pa&s;&s;age; and even this &s;mall indulgence &s;he &s;eemed to allow with a &s;urly reluctance, as if compelled to obey the command of a &s;uperior. The moment &s;he was gone, Ellena withdrew to her plea&s;ant turret, where, after having &s;uffered from the coar&s;e manners of the novices, her gratitude was the more lively, when &s;he perceived the
<PB N="136" REF="032735_0134_0FF46F51F3E44958">
delicate attention of her beloved nun. It appeared that &s;he had vi&s;ited the chamber in Ellena's ab&s;ence, and had cau&s;ed to be brought thither a chair and a table, on which were placed &s;ome books, and a knot of fra|grant flowers. Ellena did not repre&s;s the grateful tears, which the generous feelings of Olivia excited; and &s;he forbore, for &s;ome moments, to examine the books, that the plea&s;ing emotions &s;he experienced might not be interrupted.</P>
<P>On looking into the&s;e books, however, &s;he percei|ved that &s;ome of them treated of my&s;tical &s;ubjects, which &s;he laid a&s;ide with di&s;appointment; but in others &s;he ob&s;erved a few of the be&s;t Italian poets, and a volume or two of Guicciardini's hi&s;tory. She was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed, that the poets &s;hould have found their way to the library of a nun, but was too much plea&s;ed with the di&s;covery to dwell on the enquiry.</P>
<P>Having arranged her books, and &s;et her little room in order, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf at a window, and, with a volume of Ta&s;&s;o, endeavoured to bani&s;h every pain|ful remembrance from her mind. She continued wan|dering in the imaginary &s;cenes of the poet, till the fading light recalled her to tho&s;e of reality. The &s;un was &s;et, but the mountain-tops were &s;till lighted up by his beams, and a tint of glorious purple coloured all the we&s;t, and began to change the &s;nowy points on the horizon. The &s;ilence and repo&s;e of the va&s;t &s;cene, promoted the tender melancholy that prevailed in her heart; &s;he thought of Vivaldi, and wept&mdash;of Vivaldi, whom &s;he might, perhaps, never &s;ee again, though &s;he doubted not that he would be indefatigable in &s;earch|ing for her. Every particular of their la&s;t conver&s;a|tion, when he had &s;o earne&s;tly lamented the approach|ing &s;eparation, even while he allowed of its propriety, came to her mind; and while &s;he witne&s;&s;ed, in ima|gination, the grief and di&s;traction, which her my&s;te|rious departure and ab&s;ence mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned him,
<PB N="137" REF="032735_0135_0FF46F0BA53A22D8">
the fortitude, with which &s;he had re&s;i&s;ted her own &s;ufferings, yielded to the picture of his.</P>
<P>The ve&s;per-bell, at length, &s;ummoned her to pre|pare for ma&s;s, and &s;he de&s;cended to her cell to await the arrival of her conductre&s;s. It was Margaritone, who &s;oon appeared; but in the chapel &s;he, as u&s;ual, &s;aw Olivia, who, when the &s;ervice had concluded, in|vited her into the garden of the convent. There, as &s;he walked beneath the melancholy cypre&s;&s;es, that ranged on either &s;ide the long walks, formed a maje&s;tic canopy, almo&s;t excluding the evening twilight. O|livia conver&s;ed with her on &s;erious, but general topics, carefully avoiding any mention of the abbe&s;s, and of the affairs of Ellena. The latter, anxious to learn the effect of her repeated rejection of the veil, ventur|ed to make &s;ome enquires, which the nun immediately di&s;couraged, and as cautiou&s;ly checked the grateful effu&s;ions of her young friend for the attentions &s;he had received.</P>
<P>Olivia accompanied Ellena to her cell, and there no longer &s;crupled to relieve her from uncertainty. With a mixture of frankne&s;s and di&s;cretion, &s;he re|lated as much of the conver&s;ation, that had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween her&s;elf and the abbe&s;s, as it appeared nece&s;&s;ary for Ellena to know, from which it &s;eemed that the former was as ob&s;tinate, as the latter was firm.</P>
<P>"Whatever may be your re&s;olution," added the nun, "I earne&s;tly advi&s;e you, my &s;i&s;ter, to allow the Supe|rior &s;ome hope of compliance, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould proceed to extremities."</P>
<P>"And what extremity can be more terrible," repli|ed Ellena, "than either of tho&s;e to which &s;he would now urge me? Why &s;hould I de&s;cend to practice di&s;&s;imulation?"</P>
<P>"To &s;ave your&s;elf from unde&s;erved &s;ufferings," &s;aid Olivia mournfully.</P>
<P>"Yes, but I &s;hould then incur de&s;erved ones," ob|&s;erved
<PB N="138" REF="032735_0136_0FF46F56E656B280">
Ellena; "and forfeit &s;uch peace of mind as my oppre&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> never could re&s;tore to me." As &s;he &s;aid this, &s;he looked at the nun with an expre&s;&s;ion of gentle reproach and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>"I applaud the ju&s;tne&s;s of your &s;entiment," replied Olivia, regarding her with tendere&s;t compa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;"Alas! that a mind &s;o noble &s;hould be &s;ubjected to the power of inju&s;tice and depravity!"</P>
<P>"Not &s;ubjected," &s;aid Ellena, "do not &s;ay &s;ubject|ed. I have accu&s;tomed my&s;elf to contemplate the&s;e &s;ufferings; I have cho&s;en the lea&s;t of &s;uch as were given to my choice, and I will endure them with for|titude; and can you then &s;ay that I am &s;ubjected?"</P>
<P>"Alas, my &s;i&s;ter! you know not what you promi&s;e," replied Olivia; "you do not comprehend the &s;uffer|ings which may be preparing for you."</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke, her eyes filled with tears, and &s;he withdrew them from Ellena, who, &s;urpri&s;ed at the ex|treme concern on her countenance, entreated &s;he would explain her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"I am not certain my&s;elf as to this point," &s;aid Oli|via; "and if I were, I &s;hould not dare to explain it."</P>
<P>"Not dare!" repeated Ellena, mournfully. "Can benevolence like yours know fear, when courage is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent evil?"</P>
<P>"Enquire no further," &s;aid Olivia; but no blu&s;h of con&s;cious duplicity &s;tained her cheek. "It is &s;uf|ficient that you under&s;tand the con&s;equence of open re&s;i&s;tance to be terrible, and that you con&s;ent to avoid it."</P>
<P>"But how avoid it, my beloved friend, without in|curring a con&s;equence which, in my apprehen&s;ion, would be yet more dreadful? How avoid it, without either &s;ubjecting my&s;elf to a hateful marriage, or ac|cepting the vows? Either of the&s;e events would be more terrible to me, than any thing with which I may be menaced."</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="032735_0137_0FF46F0D813FD300">
"Perhaps not," &s;aid the nun, "Imagination cannot draw the horrors of&mdash;But, my &s;i&s;ter, let me repeat, that I would &s;ave you! O, how willingly &s;ave you from the evils preparing! and that the only chance of doing &s;o is, by prevailing with you to abandon at lea&s;t the appearance of re&s;i&s;tance."</P>
<P>"Your kindne&s;s deeply affects me," &s;aid Ellena; "and I am fearful of appearing in&s;en&s;ible of it, when I reject your advice; yet I cannot adopt it. The very di&s;&s;imulation, which I &s;hould employ in &s;elf-defence, might be a means of involving me in de|&s;truction."</P>
<P>As Ellena concluded, and her eyes glanced upon the nun, unaccountable &s;u&s;picion occurred to her, that Olivia might be in&s;incere, and that, at this very mo|ment, when &s;he was advi&s;ing di&s;&s;imulation, &s;he was endeavouring to draw Ellena into &s;ome &s;nare, which the abbe&s;s had laid. She &s;ickened at this dreadful &s;up|po&s;ition, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed it without &s;uffering her&s;elf to examine its probability. That Olivia, from whom &s;he had received &s;o many attentions, who&s;e counte|nance and manners announced &s;o fair a mind, and for whom &s;he had conceived &s;o much e&s;teem and affec|tion, &s;hould be cruel and treacherous, was a &s;u&s;picion that gave her more pain than the actual impri&s;onment in which &s;he &s;uffered; and when &s;he looked again upon her face, Ellena was con&s;oled by a clear convic|tion, that &s;he was utterly incapable of perfidy.</P>
<P>"If it were po&s;&s;ible that I could con&s;ent to practi&s;e deceit," re&s;umed Ellena, after a long pau&s;e, "what could it avail me? I am entirely in the power of the abbe&s;s, who would &s;oon put my &s;incerity to the proof; when a di&s;covery of my duplicity would only provoke her vengeance, and I &s;hould be puni&s;hed even for ha|ving &s;ought to avoid inju&s;tice."</P>
<P>"If deceit is at any time excu&s;able," replied Olivia, reluctantly, "it is when we pract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t in &s;elf-defence.

There are &s;ome rare &s;ituations, when it may be re&s;ort|ed to without our incurring ignominy, and yours is one of tho&s;e. But I will acknowledge, that all the good I expect is from the delay which temporizing may procure you. The Superior, when &s;he under|&s;tands there is a probability of obtaining your con&s;ent to her wi&s;hes, may be willing to allow you the u&s;ual time of preparation for the veil, and meanwhile &s;ome|thing may occur to re&s;cue you from your pre&s;ent &s;ituation."</P>
<P>"Ah! could I but believe &s;o!" &s;aid Ellena; "but alas! what power can re&s;cue me? And I have not one relative remaining even to attempt my deliverance. To what po&s;&s;ibility do you allude?"</P>
<P>"The Marche&s;a may relent."</P>
<P>"Does, then, your po&s;&s;ibility of good re&s;t with her, my dear friend? If &s;o, I am in de&s;pair again; for &s;uch a chance of benefit, there would certainly be little po|licy in forfeiting one's integrity."</P>
<P>"There are al&s;o other po&s;&s;ibilities, my &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid Olivia; "but, hark! what bell is that? It is the chime which a&s;&s;embles the nuns in the apartment of the abbe&s;s, where &s;he di&s;pen&s;es her evening benedic|tion. My ab&s;ence will be ob&s;erved. Good night, my &s;i&s;ter.

<P>The nun &s;poke this with a look and empha&s;is &s;o extraordinary, that Ellena at once wi&s;hed and dreaded to know more; but before &s;he had recovered from her &s;urpri&s;e, Olivia had le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t the room.</P>

<P>THE adventurous Vivaldi, and his &s;ervant Paulo, after pa&s;&s;ing the night of Ellena's departure from the villa Altieri in one of the &s;ubterraneous chambers of the fort of Palluzz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and yielding, at length, to ex|hau&s;ted nature, awoke in terror, and utter darkne&s;s, for the flambeau had expired. When a recollection of the occurrences of the preceding evening returned, they renewed their efforts for liberty with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dour. The grated window was again examined, and being found to overlook only a confined court of the fortre&s;s, no hope appeared of e&s;caping.</P>
<P>The words of the monk returned with Vivaldi's fir&s;t recollections to torture him with apprehen|&s;ion, that Ellena was no more; and Paulo, unable ei|ther to con&s;ole or to appea&s;e his ma&s;ter, &s;at down de|jectedly be&s;ide him. Paulo had no longer a hope to &s;ug|ge&s;t, or a joke to throw away; and he could not forbear &s;eriou&s;ly remarking that to die of hunger was one of the mo&s;t horrible means of death, of lamenting the ra&s;hne&s;s which made them liable to &s;o &s;ad a probability.</P>
<P>He was in the mid&s;t of a very pathetic oration, of which, however, his ma&s;ter did not hear a &s;ingle word, &s;o wholly was his attention engaged by his own melan|choly thoughts, when, on a &s;udden he became &s;ilent, and then, &s;tarting to his feet, exclaimed, "Signor, what is yonder? Do you &s;ee nothing?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi looked round.</P>
<P>"It is certainly a ray of light," continued Paulo; "and I will &s;oon know where it comes from."</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="032735_0140_0FF46F5B7ACF9678">
As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;aid this he &s;prang forwards, and his &s;urprize almo&s;t equalled his joy when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e di&s;covered that the light i&s;&s;ued through the door of the vault, which &s;tood a little open. He could &s;carcely believe his &s;en&s;es, &s;ince the door had been &s;trongly fa&s;tened on the pre|ceding night, and he had not heard its ponderous bolts undrawn. He threw it widely open, but recollecting him&s;elf, &s;topped to look into the adjoining vault before he ventured forth; when Vivaldi darted pa&s;t him, and bidding him follow in&s;tantly, a&s;cended to the day. The courts of the fortre&s;s were &s;ilent and vacant, and Vivaldi reached the arch way without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aving ob&s;er|ved a &s;ingle per&s;on, breathle&s;s with &s;peed, and &s;carce|ly daring to believe that he had regained his liberty.</P>
<P>Beneath the arch he &s;topped to recover breath, and to con&s;ider whether he &s;hould take the road to Naples, or to the villa Altieri, for it was yet early morning, and at an hour when it appeared improbable that Ellena's family would be ri&s;en. The apprehen&s;ion of her death had vani&s;hed as Vivaldi's &s;pirits revived, which the pau&s;e of he&s;itation &s;ufficiently announced: but even this was the pau&s;e only of an in&s;tant; a &s;trong anxiety concerning her determined him to proceed to the villa Altieri, notwith&s;tanding the un|&s;uitablene&s;s of the hour, &s;ince he could at lea&s;t, recon|noitre her re&s;idence, and await till &s;ome &s;ign of the fa|mily having ri&s;en &s;hould appear.</P>
<P>"Pray, Signor," &s;aid Paulo, while his ma&s;ter was deliberating, "do not let us &s;top here, lea&s;t the ene|my &s;hould appear again; and do, Signor, take the road which is nearne&s;t to &s;ome hou&s;e where we may get breakfa&s;t, for the fear of &s;tarving has taken &s;uch hold upon me, that it has nearly anticipated the reality of it already."</P>
<P>Vivaldi immediately departed for the villa. Paulo, as he danced joyfully along, expre&s;&s;ed all the a&s;toni&s;h|ment that filled his mind, as to the cau&s;e of their late
<PB N="143" REF="032735_0141_0FF46F14A2D6D6A8">
impri&s;onment and e&s;cape; but Vivaldi, who had now lei&s;ure to con&s;ider the &s;ubject, could not a&s;&s;i&s;t him in explaining it. The only certainty that appeared, was, that he had not been confined by robbers; and what intere&s;t any per&s;on could have in impri&s;oning him for the night, and &s;uffering him to e&s;cape in the morning, did not appear.</P>
<P>On entering the garden at Altieri, he was &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve that &s;everal of the lower lattices were open at this early hour, but &s;urpri&s;e changed to terror, when, on reaching the portico, he heard a moaning of di&s;|tre&s;s from the hall, and, when, after loudly calling, he was an&s;wered by the piteous cries of Beatrice. The hall door was fa&s;tened, and, Beatrice being unable to open it, Vivaldi, followed by Paulo, &s;prang through one of the unclo&s;ed lattices; when on reaching the hall, he found the hou&s;e-keeper bound to a pillar, and learn|ed that Ellena had been carried off during the night by armed men.</P>
<P>For a moment he was almo&s;t &s;tupified by the &s;hock of this intelligence, and then a&s;ked Beatrice a thou|&s;and que&s;tions concerning the affair, without allowing her time to an&s;wer one of them. When, however, he had patience to li&s;ten, he learned that the ruffians were four in number; that they were ma&s;ked; that two of them had carried Ellena thro' the garden, while the others, after binding Beatrice to a pillar, threatening her with death if &s;he made any noi&s;e, and watching over her till their comrades had &s;ecured their prize, left her a pri&s;oner. This was all the infor|mation &s;he could give re&s;pecting Ellena.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, when he could think coolly, believed he had di&s;covered the in&s;tigators and the de&s;ign of the whole affair, and the cau&s;e, al&s;o, of his late confine|ment. It appeared that Ellena had been carried off by order of his family, to prevent the intended marri|age, and that he had been decoyed into the fort of
<PB N="144" REF="032735_0142_0FF46F5D3AC935A8">
Paluzzi, and kept a pri&s;oner there, to prevent him from intercepting the &s;cheme, which his pre&s;ence at the villa Altieri would effectually have done. He had him&s;elf &s;poken of his former adventure at Paluzzi; and it now appeared, that his family had taken advan|tage of the curio&s;ity he had expre&s;&s;ed, to lead him into the vaults. The event of this de&s;ign was the more certain, &s;ince, as the fort lay in the direct road to the villa Altieri, Vivaldi could not go thither without be|ing ob&s;erved by the creatures of the Marche&s;a, who, by an artful manoeuvre, might make him their pri|&s;oner, without employing violence.</P>
<P>As he con&s;idered the&s;e circum&s;tances, it appeared certain, al&s;o, that father Schedoni was in truth the monk who had &s;o long haunted his &s;teps; that he was the &s;ecret advi&s;er of his mother, and one of the authors of the predicted misfortunes which, it &s;eemed, he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a too certain means of fulfilling. Yet Vivaldi, while he admitted the probability of all this, reflected with new a&s;toni&s;hment on the conduct of Schedoni, during his interview with him in the Marche&s;a's ca|binet;&mdash;the air of dignified innocence with which he had repre&s;&s;ed accu&s;ation, the apparent &s;implicity, with which he had pointed out circum&s;tances re&s;pecting the &s;tranger, that &s;eemed to make again&s;t him&s;elf; and Vi|valdi's opinion of the confe&s;&s;or's duplicity began to waver. "Yet what other per&s;on," &s;aid he, "could be &s;o intimately acquainted with my concerns, or have an intere&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;trong for thus indefatigably thwarting me, except this confe&s;&s;or, who is, no doubt, well rewarded for his per&s;everance? The monk can be no other than S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hedoni, yet it is &s;trange that he &s;hould have forborn to di&s;gui&s;e his per&s;on, and &s;hould appear in his my&s;terious office in the very habit he u&s;ually wears!"</P>
<P>Whatever might be the truth as to Schedoni, it was evident that Ellena had been carried away by order of
<PB N="145" REF="032735_0143_0FF46F175A0D7EA0">
Vivaldi's family, and he immediately returned towards Naples with an intention of demanding her at their hands, not with any hope of their compliance, but be|lieving that they might accidentally afford him &s;ome lights on the &s;ubject. If, however, he &s;hould fail to obtain any hint that might a&s;&s;i&s;t him in tracing the route &s;he had been carried, he determined to vi&s;it Schedoni, accu&s;e him of perfidy, urge him to a full ex|planation of his conduct, and, if po&s;&s;ible, obtain from him a knowledge of Ellena's place of confinement.</P>
<P>When, at length, he obtained an interview with the Marche&s;e, and, throwing him&s;elf at his feet, &s;upplicat|ed that Ellena might be re&s;tored to her home, the un|affected &s;urpri&s;e of his father overwhelmed him with a&s;toni&s;hment and de&s;pair. The look and manner of the Marche&s;e could not be doubted; Vivaldi was con|vinced that he was ab&s;olutely ignorant of any &s;tep which had been taken again&s;t Ellena.</P>
<P>"However ungraciou&s;ly you have conducted your|&s;elf," &s;aid the Marche&s;e, "my honour has never yet been &s;ullied by duplicity; however I may have wi&s;hed to break the unworthy connection you have formed, I &s;hould di&s;dain to employ artifice as the means. If you really de&s;ign to marry this per&s;on, I &s;hall make no other effort to prevent &s;uch a mea&s;ure, than by tel|ling you the con&s;equence you are to expect;&mdash;from thenceforth I will di&s;own you for my &s;on."</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e quitted the apartment when he had &s;aid this, and Vivaldi made no attempt to detain him. His words expre&s;&s;ed little more than they had former|ly done, yet Vivaldi was &s;hocked by the ab&s;olute me|nace now delivered. The &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ion of his heart, however, &s;oon overcame their effect; and this moment, when he began to fear that he had irrecover|ably lo&s;t the object of his deare&s;t affection<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, was not the time in which he could feel remoter evils, or cal|culate the force of misfortunes which never might
<PB N="146" REF="032735_0144_0FF46F607A847BE8">
arrive. The nearer intere&s;t pre&s;&s;ed &s;olely upon his mind, and he was con&s;cious only to the lo&s;s of Ellena.</P>
<P>The interview, which followed with his mother, was of a different character from that which had oc|curred with the Marche&s;e. The keen dart of &s;u&s;pi|cion, however, &s;harpened as it was by love and de|&s;pair, pierced beyond the veil of her duplicity; and Vivaldi as quickly detected her hypocri&s;y as he had yielded his conviction to the &s;incerity of the Marche&s;e. But his power re&s;ted here; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no means of awakening her pity or actuating her ju&s;tice, and could not obtain even a hint, that might guide him in his &s;earch of Ellena.</P>
<P>Schedoni, however, yet remained to be tried; Vi|valdi had no longer a doubt as to his having caballed with the Marche&s;a, and that he had been an agent in removing Ellena. Whether he was the per&s;on who haunted the ruins of Paluzzi, &s;till remained to be proved, for, though &s;everal circum&s;tances &s;eemed to declare that he was, others, not le&s;s plau&s;ible, a&s;&s;erted the contrary.</P>
<P>On leaving the Marche&s;a's apartment, Vivaldi re|paired to the convent of the Spirito Santo, and en|quired for father Schedoni. The lay-brother who opened the gate, informed him that the father was in his cell, and Vivaldi &s;tepped impatiently into the court, reque&s;ting to be &s;hewn thither.</P>
<P>"I dare not leave the gate, Signor," &s;aid the bro|the, "but if you cro&s;s the court, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that &s;tair|ca&s;e which you &s;ee yonder beyond the door-way on your right, it will lead you to a gallery, and the third door you will come to is father S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ni's."</P>
<P>Vivaldi pa&s;&s;ed on without &s;eeing another human being, and not a &s;ound di&s;turbed the &s;ilence of this &s;anctuary, till, as he a&s;cended the &s;tairs, a feeble note of lamentation proceeded from the gallery, and he con|cluded i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> was uttered by &s;ome penitent at confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="032735_0145_0FF46F1906982BE0">
He &s;topped, as he had been directed, at the third door, when, as he gently knocked, the &s;ound cea&s;ed, and the &s;ame profound &s;ilence returned. Vivaldi re|peated his &s;ummons, but receiving no an&s;wer, he ven|tured to open the door. In the du&s;ky cell within no per&s;on appeared, but he &s;till looked round, expect|ing to di&s;cover &s;ome one in the dubious gloom. The chamber contained little more than a mattre&s;s, a chair, a table, and a crucifix; &s;ome books of devotion were upon the table, one or two of which were written in unknown characters; &s;everal in&s;truments of torture lay be&s;ide them. Vivaldi &s;huddered as he ha&s;tily ex|amined the&s;e, though he did not comprehend the man|ner of their application, and he left the chamber, with|out noticing any other object, and returned to the court. The porter &s;aid, that &s;ince father Schedoni was not in his cell, he was probably either in the church or in the gardens, for that he had not pa&s;&s;ed the gates during the morning.</P>
<P>"Did he pa&s;s ye&s;ter-evening?" &s;aid Vivaldi, ea|gerly.</P>
<P>"Yes, he returned to ve&s;pers," replied the brother with &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>"Are you certain as to that, my friend?" rejoined Vivaldi, "are you certain that he &s;lept in the convent la&s;t night?"</P>
<P>"Who is it that a&s;ks the que&s;tion?" &s;aid the lay-brother, with di&s;plea&s;ure, "and what right has he to make it? You are ignorant of the rules of our hou&s;e, Signor, or you would perceive &s;uch que&s;tions to be unnece&s;&s;ary; any member of our community is liable to be &s;everely puni&s;hed if he &s;leep a night without the&s;e walls, and father S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">doni would be the la&s;t among us &s;o to tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;pa&s;s.

<PB N="148" REF="032735_0146_0FF47022A816AA30">
Signor, yonder is the church, you will find him there, perhaps!</P>
<P>Vivaldi did not linger to reply. "The hypocrite!" &s;aid he to him&s;elf as he cro&s;&s;ed to the church, which formed one &s;ide of the quadrangle; "but I will un|ma&s;k him."</P>
<P>The church, which he entered, was vacant and &s;ilent like the court. "Whither can the inhabitants of this place have withdrawn them&s;elves?" &s;aid he; "wherever I go, I hear only the echoes of my own &s;cot&s;teps; it &s;eems as if death reigned here over all! But, perhaps, it is one of the hours of general me|ditation, and the monks have only retired to their cells."</P>
<P>As he paced the long ai&s;les, he &s;uddenly &s;topped to catch the &s;tartling &s;ound that murmured through the lofty roof; but it &s;eemed to be only the clo&s;ing of a di&s;tant door. Yet he often looked forward into the &s;acred gloom, which the painted windows threw over the remote per&s;pective, in the expectation of perceiv|ing a monk. He was not long di&s;appointed; a per|&s;on appeared, &s;tanding &s;ilently in an ob&s;cure part of the cloi&s;ter, cloathed in the habit of this &s;ociety, and he advanced towards him.</P>
<P>The monk did not avoid Vivaldi, or even turn to ob&s;erve who was approaching, but remained in the &s;ame attitude, fixed like a &s;tatue. This tall and gaunt figure had, at a di&s;tance, reminded him of Schedoni, and Vivaldi, as he now looked under the cowl, di&s;co|vered the gha&s;tly countenance of the confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"Have I found you at la&s;t?" &s;aid Vivaldi. "I would &s;peak with you, father, in private. This is not a proper place for &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e as we mu&s;t hold."</P>
<P>Schedoni made no reply, and Vivaldi, once again looking at him, ob&s;erved that his features were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ixed, and his eyes bent towards the ground. The words of Vivaldi &s;eemed not to have reached his under&s;tand|ing,
<PB N="149" REF="032735_0147_0FF46F1AF735B290">
nor even to have made any impre&s;&s;ion on his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>He repeated them in a louder tone, but &s;till not a &s;ingle line of Schedoni's countenance acknowledged their influence. "What means this mummery?" &s;aid he, his patience exhau&s;ted, and his indignation arou&s;ed; "This wretched &s;ubterfuge &s;hall not pro|tect you, you are detected, your &s;tratagems are known! Re&s;tore Ellena di Ro&s;alba to her home, or confe&s;s where you have concealed her."</P>
<P>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hedoni was &s;till &s;ilent and unmoved. A re&s;pect for his age and profe&s;&s;ion with-held Vivaldi from &s;eizing and compelling him to an&s;wer; but the agony of impatience and indignation which he &s;uffered, formed a &s;triking contra&s;t to the death-like apathy of the monk. "I now al&s;o know you," continued Vi|valdi, "for my tormentor at Paluzzi, the prophet of evils, which you too well practi&s;ed the means of ful|filling, the predictor of the death of Signora Bianchi." Schedoni frowned. "Forewarner of Ellena's depar|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ure; the phantom who decoyed me into the dungeons of Paluzzi; the prophet and the artificer of all my misfortunes."</P>
<P>The monk rai&s;ed his eyes from the ground, and fixed them with terrible expre&s;&s;ion upon Vivaldi, but was &s;till &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Yes, father," added Vivaldi, "I know and will proclaim you to the world. I will &s;trip you of the holy hypocri&s;y in which you &s;hroud your&s;elf; an|nounce to all your &s;ociety the de&s;picable artifices you have employed, and the mi&s;ery you have occa&s;ioned. Your character &s;hall be announced aloud."</P>
<P>While Vivaldi &s;poke, the monk had withdrawn his eyes, and fixed them again on the ground. His coun|tenance had re&s;umed its u&s;ual expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Wretch! re&s;tore to me Ellena di Ro&s;alba!" cried Vivaldi, with the &s;udden angui&s;h of renewed de&s;pair.
<PB N="150" REF="032735_0148_0FF4702447754188">
"Tell me at lea&s;t, where &s;he may be found, or you &s;hall be compelled to do &s;o. Whither, whither have you conveyed her?"</P>
<P>As he pronounced this in loud and pa&s;&s;ionate ac|cents, &s;everal eccle&s;ia&s;tics entered the cloi&s;ters, and were pa&s;&s;ing on to the body of the church, when his voice arre&s;ted their attention. They pau&s;ed, and per|ceiving the &s;ingular attitude of Schedoni, and the frantic ge&s;ticulations of Vivaldi, ha&s;tily advanced to|wards them. "Forbear," &s;aid one of the &s;trangers, as he &s;eized the cloak of Vivaldi, "do you not ob&s;erve!"</P>
<P>"I ob&s;erve a hypocrite," replied Vivaldi, &s;tepping back and di&s;engaging him&s;elf, "I ob&s;erve a de&s;troyer of the peace, it was his duty to protect. I"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Forbear this de&s;perate conduct," &s;aid the prie&s;t, "le&s;t it provoke the ju&s;t vengeance of Heaven! Do you not ob&s;erve the holy office in which he is engag|ed?" pointing to the monk. "Leave the church while you are permitted to do &s;o in &s;afety; you &s;u&s;pect not the puni&s;hment you may provoke."</P>
<P>"I will not quit the &s;pot till you an&s;wer my en|quiries," &s;aid Vivaldi to Schedoni, without deigning even to look upon the prie&s;t; "Where, I repeat, is Ellena di Ro&s;alba?"</P>
<P>The confe&s;&s;or was &s;till &s;ilent and unmoved. "This is beyond all patience and all belief," continued Vi|valdi. "Speak! An&s;wer me, or dread what I may unfold. Yet &s;ilent! Do you know the convent del Pianto? Do you know the confe&s;&s;ional of the Black Penitents?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi thought he perceived the countenance of the monk &s;uffer &s;ome change. "Do you remember that terrible night," he added, "when, on the &s;teps of that confe&s;&s;ional, a tale was told?"&mdash;</P>
<P>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hedoni rai&s;ed his eyes, and fixing them once more on Vivaldi, with a look that &s;eemed intended to &s;trike him to the du&s;t, "Avaunt!" cried he in a tremendous

voice; "avaunt! &s;acrilegious boy! Tremble for the con&s;equence of thy de&s;perate impiety!"</P>
<P>As he concluded, he &s;tarted from his po&s;ition, and gliding with the &s;ilent &s;wiftne&s;s of a &s;hadow along the cloi&s;ter, vani&s;hed in an in&s;tant. Vivaldi, when at|tempting to pur&s;ue him, was &s;eized by the &s;urround|ing monks. In&s;en&s;ible to his &s;ufferings, and exa&s;pe|rated by his a&s;&s;ertions, they threatened, that if he did not immediately quit the convent, he &s;hould be con|fined, and undergo the &s;evere puni&s;hment to which he had become liable, for having di&s;turbed and even in|&s;ulted one of their holy order while performing an act of penance.</P>
<P>"He had need of &s;uch acts," &s;aid Vivaldi; "but when can they re&s;tore the happine&s;s his treachery has de&s;troyed? Your order is di&s;graced by &s;uch a member, reverend fathers; your"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Peace!" cried a monk, "he is the pride of our hou&s;e; he is &s;evere in his devotion, and in &s;elf-puni&s;h|ment terrible beyond the reach of&mdash;But I am throw|ing away my commendations, I am talking to one who is not permitted to value or to under&s;tand the &s;acred my&s;teries of our exerci&s;es."</P>
<P>"Away with him to the Padre Abbate!" cried an enraged prie&s;t; "away with him to the dungeon!"</P>
<P>"Away! away!" repeated his companions, and they endeavoured to force Vivaldi through the cloi|&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rs. But with the &s;udden &s;trength which pride and indignation lent him, he bur&s;t from their united hold, and, quitting the church by another door, e&s;caped into the &s;treet.</P>
<P>Vivaldi returned home in a fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">te of mind that would have engaged the pity of any heart, which pre|judice or &s;elf-intere&s;t had not hardened.

<P><PB N="152" REF="032735_0150_0FF4702864BDAF78">
When the Marche&s;a had been informed of his ap|proaching marriage, &s;he had, as u&s;ual, con&s;ulted with her confe&s;&s;or on the means of preventing it, who had advi&s;ed the &s;cheme &s;he adopted, a &s;cheme which was the more ea&s;ily carried into effect, &s;ince the Marche&s;a had early in life been acquainted with the abbe&s;s of San Stefano, and knew, therefore, enough of her cha|racter and di&s;po&s;ition to confide, without he&s;itation, the management of this important affair to her di&s;cretion. The an&s;wer of the abbe&s;s to her propo&s;al, was not merely acquie&s;cent, but zealous, and it appeared that &s;he too faithfully ju&s;tified the confidence repo&s;ed in her. After this plan had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully pro&s;e|cuted, it was not to be hoped that the Marche&s;a would be prevailed upon to relinqui&s;h it by the tears, the an|gui&s;h, or all the varied &s;ufferings of her &s;on. Vivaldi now reproved the ea&s;ine&s;s of his own confidence in having hoped it, and quitted her cabinet with a de|&s;pondency that almo&s;t reached de&s;pair.</P>
<P>The faithful Paulo obeyed the ha&s;ty &s;ummons of his ma&s;ter, but he had not &s;ucceeded in obtaining in|telligence of Ellena; and Vivaldi, having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him again on the &s;ame enquiry, retired to his apart|ment, where the exce&s;s of grief, and the feeble hope of devi&s;ing &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful mode of remedy, alternately agitated and detained him.</P>
<P>In the evening, re&s;tle&s;s and anxious for change, though &s;carcely knowing whither to bend his cour&s;e, he l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ft the palace, and &s;trolled down to the &s;ea-beach. A few fi&s;hermen and lazzaroni only were loitering along the &s;trand, waiting for boats from St. Lucia. Vivaldi with folded arms, and his hat drawn over his face to &s;hade his &s;orrow from ob&s;ervation, paced the edge of the waves, li&s;tening to their murmur, as they broke gently at his feet, and gazing upon their undulating beauty, while all con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s was lo&s;t in melancholy reverie concerning Ellena. Her late re&s;idence ap|peared
<PB N="153" REF="032735_0152_0FF4702CAEC6B758">
at a di&s;tance, ri&s;ing over the &s;hore. He remem|bered how often from thence they had together view|ed this lovely &s;cene! Its features had now lo&s;t their charm; they were colourle&s;s and unintere&s;ting, or im|pre&s;&s;ed only mournful ideas. The &s;ea fluctuating be|neath the &s;etting &s;un, the long mole and its light-hou&s;e tipped with the la&s;t rays, fi&s;hermen repo&s;ing in the &s;hade, little boats, &s;kimming over the &s;mooth waters, which their oars &s;carcely dimpled; the&s;e were images that brought to his recollection the affecting evening when he had la&s;t &s;een this picture from the villa Altie|r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, when &s;eated in the orangery with Ellena and Bi|anchi on the night preceding the death of the latter, Ellean her&s;elf had &s;o &s;olemnly been given to his care, and had &s;o affectingly con&s;ented to the dying reque&s;t of her relative.</P>
<P>The recollection of that &s;cene came to Vivaldi with all the force of contra&s;t, and renewed all the angui&s;h of de&s;pair; he paced the beach with quicker &s;teps, and long groans bur&s;t from his heart. He accu&s;ed him&s;elf of indifference and inactivity, for having been thus long unable to di&s;cover a &s;ingle circum&s;tance which might direct his &s;earch; and though he knew not whi|ther to go, he determined to leave Naples immediately, and return no more to his father's man&s;ion till he &s;hould have re&s;cued Ellena.</P>
<P>Of &s;ome fi&s;hermen who were conver&s;ing together upon the beach, he enquired, whether they could ac|commodate him with a boat, in which he meant to coa&s;t the bay; for it appeared probable that Ellena had been conveyed from Altieri by water, to &s;ome town or con|vent on the &s;hore, the privacy and facility of &s;uch a mode of conveyance being &s;uitable to the de&s;igns of her enemies.</P>
<P>"I have but one boat, Signor," &s;aid the fi&s;herman, "and that is bu&s;y enough in going to and fro between here and Santa Lucia, but my comrade, here, perhaps, can &s;erve you. What, Carlo, can you help the Signor

to your little &s;kiff? the other, I know has enough to do in the trade."</P>
<P>His comrade, however, was too much engaged with a party of three or four men, who were li&s;tening in deep attention round him, to reply; Vivaldi advancing to urge the que&s;tion, was &s;truck by the eagerne&s;s with which he delivered his narrative, as well as the un|couthne&s;s of his ge&s;ticulation; and he pau&s;ed a moment in attention. One of the auditors &s;eemed to doubt of &s;omething that had been a&s;&s;erted. "I tell you," re|plied the narrator, "I u&s;ed to carry fi&s;h there two and three times a week, and very good &s;ort of people they were; they have laid out many a ducat with me in their time. But as I was &s;aying, when I got there, and knocked upon the door, I heard, all of a &s;udden, a huge groaning, and pre&s;ently I heard the voice of the old hou&s;ekeeper her&s;elf, roaring out for help; but I could give her none, for the door was fa&s;tened; and while I ran away for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to old Bartoli, you know old Bartoli, he lives by the road &s;ide as you go to Naples; well while I ran to him, comes a Signor, and jumps through the window and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ets her at liberty at once. So then, I heard the whole &s;tory."&mdash;</P>
<P>"What &s;tory?" &s;aid Vivaldi, "and of whom do you &s;peak?"</P>
<P>"All in good time, Mae&s;tro, you &s;hall hear," &s;aid the fi&s;herman, who looking at him for a moment, ad|ded, "Why, Signor, it &s;hould be you I &s;aw there, you &s;hould be the very Signor that let Beatrice loo&s;e."</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who had &s;carcely doubted before, that it was Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ieri, of which the man had &s;poken, now a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions re&s;pecting the route the ruffians had taken Ellena, but obtained no relief to his anxiety.</P>
<P>"I &s;hould not wonder," &s;aid a Lazzaro, who had been li&s;tening to the relation; "I &s;hould not wonder if the carriage that pa&s;&s;ed Bracelli early on the &s;ame morning, with the blinds drawn up, though it was &s;o

<P>This hint was &s;ufficient to re-animate Vivaldi, who collected all the information the Lazzaro could give, which was, however, little more than that a carriage, &s;uch as he de&s;cribed, had been &s;een by him, driving furiou&s;ly through Bracelli, early on the morning men|tioned as that of Signora di Ro&s;alba's departure.

<P>With this intention he returned once more to his father's man&s;ion, not to acquaint him with his pur|po&s;e, or to bid him farewel, but to await the return of his &s;ervant Paulo, who he meant &s;hould accompany him in the &s;earch. Vivaldi's &s;pirits were now animated with hope, &s;lender as were the circum&s;tances that &s;up|ported it; and, believing his de&s;ign to be wholly un|&s;u&s;pected by tho&s;e who would be di&s;po&s;ed to interrupt it, he did not guard either again&s;t the mea&s;ures, which might impede his departure from Naples, or tho&s;e which might overtake him on his journey.</P>

<P>THE Marche&s;a, alarmed at &s;ome hints dropped by Vivaldi in the late interview between them, and by &s;ome circum&s;tances of his latter conduct, &s;um|moned her con&s;tant advi&s;er, Schedoni. Still &s;uffer|ing with the in&s;ult he had received in the church of <HI>Spirito Santo,</HI> he obeyed with &s;ullen reluctance, yet not without a malicious hope of di&s;covering &s;ome oppor|tunity fo retaliation. That in&s;ult, which had pointed forth his hypocri&s;y, and ridiculed the &s;olemn ab&s;trac|tion he a&s;&s;umed, had &s;unk deep in his heart, and fer|menting the direct pa&s;&s;ions of his nature, he meditated a terrible revenge. It had &s;ubjected him to mortifi|cations of various kinds. Ambition, it has already appeared, was one of his &s;tronge&s;t motives of action, and he had long &s;ince a&s;&s;umed a character of &s;evere &s;anctity, chiefly for the purpo&s;es of lifting him to promotion. He was not beloved in the &s;ociety of which he was a member; and many of the brotherhood, who had laboured to di&s;app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">t his views, and to detect his error, who had hated him for his pride, and envied him for his reputed &s;anctity, now gloried in the mor|tification <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e had received, and endeavoured to turn the circum&s;tance to their own advantage. They had not &s;crupled already to di&s;play by in&s;inuation and pointed &s;neers, their triumph, and to menace his reputation; and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">doni, though he de&s;erved contempt, was not of a temper to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it.</P>
<P>But above all, &s;ome hints re&s;pecting his pa&s;t life, which had fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">len from Vivaldi, and which occa&s;ioned him &s;o abruptly to leave the church, alarmed him. So much terror, indeed, had they excited, that it is not
<PB N="157" REF="032735_0155_0FF494748F7F8780">
improbable that he would have &s;ealed his &s;ecret in death, devoting Vivaldi to the grave, had he not been re&s;trained by the dreaded vengeance of the Vivaldi fa|mily. Since that hour he had known no peace, and had never &s;lept; he had taken &s;carcely any food, and was almo&s;t continually on his knees upon the &s;teps of the high altar. The devotees who beheld him, pau&s;|ed and admired; &s;uch of the brothers as di&s;liked him, &s;neered and pa&s;&s;ed on. Schedoni appeared alike in|&s;en&s;ible to each; lo&s;t to this world, and preparing for a higher.</P>
<P>The torments of his mind and the &s;evere penance he had ob&s;erved, had produced a &s;urpri&s;ing change in his appearance, &s;o that he re&s;embled a &s;pectre rather than a human being. His vi&s;age was wan and wa&s;ted, his eyes were &s;unk and become nearly motionle&s;s, and his whole air and attitudes axhibited the wild energy of &s;omething&mdash;not of this earth.</P>
<P>When he was &s;ummoned by the Marche&s;a, his con|&s;cience whi&s;pered this to be the con&s;equence of cir|cum&s;tances, which Vivaldi had revealed; and, at fir&s;t, he had determined not to attend her; but, con&s;ider|ing that if it was &s;o, his refu&s;al would confirm &s;u&s;|picion, he, re&s;olved to tru&s;t once more to the &s;ubtilty of his addre&s;s for deliverence.</P>
<P>With the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, tempered by this hope, he entered the Marche&s;a's clo&s;et. She almo&s;t &s;tarted on ob&s;erving him, and could not immediately withdraw her eyes from his altered vi&s;age, while Schedoni was unable wholly to conceal the perturbation which &s;uch earne&s;t ob&s;ervation occa&s;ioned. "Peace re&s;t with you, daughter!" &s;aid he, and he &s;eated him|&s;elf, without lifting his eyes from the floor.</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h to &s;peak with you, father, upon affairs of moment," &s;aid the Marche&s;a gravely, "which are probably not unknown to you." She pau&s;ed, and Sche|doni
<PB N="158" REF="032735_0156_0FF470320CAB5110">
bowed his head, awaiting in anxious expectation what was to follow.</P>
<P>"You are &s;ilent, father," re&s;umed the Marche&s;a. "What am I to under&s;tand by this?"</P>
<P>"That you have been mi&s;informed," replied Sche|doni, who&s;e apt con&s;cience betrayed his di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>"Pardon me," &s;aid the Marche&s;a, "I am too well informed, and &s;hould not have reque&s;ted your vi&s;it if any doubt had remained upon my mind."</P>
<P>"Signora! be cautious of what you credit," &s;aid the confe&s;&s;or imprudently; "you know not the con|&s;equence of a ha&s;ty credulity."</P>
<P>"Would that mine were a ra&s;h credulity!" replied the Marche&s;a; "but&mdash;we are betrayed."</P>
<P><HI>"We?"</HI> repeated the monk, beginning to revive: "What has happened&punc;"</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a informed him of Vivaldi's ab&s;ence, and inferred from its length, for it was now &s;everal days &s;ince his departure, that he had certainly di&s;covered the place of Ellena's confinement, as well as the au|thors of it.</P>
<P>Schedoni differed from her, but hinted, that the obedience of youth was hopele&s;s, u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;s &s;everer mea|&s;ures were adopted.</P>
<P>"Severer!" exclaimed the Marche&s;a; "good fa|ther, is it not &s;evere enough to confine her for life?"</P>
<P>"I mean &s;everer with re&s;pect to your &s;on, lady," replied Schedoni. "When a young man has &s;o far overcome all reverence for an holy ordinance as pub|licly to in&s;ult its profe&s;&s;ors, and yet more, when that profe&s;&s;or is in the very performance of his duties, it is time he &s;hould be contrould with a &s;trong hand. I am not in the practice of advi&s;ed to &s;uch mea&s;ures, but the conduct of Signor Vivaldi is &s;uch as calls aloud for them. Public decency demands it. For my&s;elf, indeed, I &s;hould have endured patiently the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ndignity which has been offered me, receiving it as
<PB N="159" REF="032735_0157_0FF494682EF88170">
a &s;alutary mortification, as one of tho&s;e inflictions that purify the &s;oul the from pride, which even the holie&s;t men may uncon&s;ciou&s;ly cheri&s;h. But I am no longer permitted to con&s;ider my&s;elf; the public good requires that an example &s;hould be made of the horrible impi|ety of which your &s;on, it grieves me, daughter, to di&s;|clo&s;e it!&mdash;your &s;on, unworthy of &s;uch a mother! has been guilty."</P>
<P>It is evident that in the &s;tyle, at lea&s;t, of this accu|&s;ation, Schedoni &s;uffered the force of his re&s;entment to prevail over the u&s;ual &s;ubtilty of his addre&s;s, the deep and &s;mooth in&s;inuation of his policy.</P>
<P>"To what do you allude, righteous father!" en|quired the a&s;toni&s;hed Marche&s;a; "what indignity, what imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ety has my &s;on to an&s;wer for? I entreat you will &s;peak explicitly, that I may prove I can lo&s;e the mother in the &s;trict &s;everity of the judge."</P>
<P>"That is &s;poken with the gradeur of &s;entiment, which has always di&s;tingui&s;hed you my daughter! Strong minds perceive that ju&s;tice is the highe&s;t of the moral attributes, mercy is only the favourite of weak ones."</P>
<P>Schedoni had a view in this commendation beyond that of confirming the Marche&s;a's pre&s;ent re&s;olution again&s;t Vivaldi. He, wi&s;hed to prepare her for mea|&s;ures, which might hereafter be nece&s;&s;ary to accompli&s;h the revenge he meditated, and he knew that by flat|tering her vanity, he was mo&s;t likely to &s;ucceed. He prai&s;ed her, therefore, for qualities he wi&s;hed her to po&s;&s;e&s;s, encouraged her to reject general opinions by admiring as the &s;ymptoms of a &s;uperior under&s;tanding, the convenient morality upon which &s;he had occa&s;i|onally acted; and, calling &s;ternne&s;s ju&s;tice, extolled that for &s;trength of mind, which was only callous in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>He then de&s;cribed to her Vivaldi's late conduct in the church of the Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ito Santo, exaggerated &s;ome
<PB N="160" REF="032735_0158_0FF470357B5043E0">
offen&s;ive circum&s;tances of it, invented others, and formed of the whole an in&s;tance of mon&s;trous impiety and unprovoked in&s;ult.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a li&s;tened to the relation with no le&s;s indignation that &s;urpri&s;e, and her readine&s;s to adopt the confe&s;&s;or's advice allowed him to depart-with re|novated &s;pirits and mo&s;t triumphant hopes.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the Marche&s;e remained ignorant of the &s;ubject of the conference with Schedoni. His opinions had formerly been &s;ounded, and having been found decidedly again&s;t the dark policy it was thought expe|dient to practi&s;e, he was never afterwards con&s;ulted re&s;pecting Vivaldi. Parental anxiety and affection began to revive as the lengthened ab&s;ence of his &s;on was ob&s;erved. Though jealous of his rank, he loved Vivaldi; and, though he never po&s;itively believed that he de&s;igned to enter into a &s;acred engagement with a per&s;on, whom the Marche&s;e con&s;idered to be &s;o much his inferior as Ellena, he had &s;uffered doubts, which gave him con&s;iderable unea&s;ine&s;s. The pre&s;ent ex|traordinary ab&s;ence of Vivaldi renewed his alarm. He apprehended that if &s;he was di&s;covered at this moment, when the fear of lo&s;ing her for ever, and the exa&s;peration, which &s;uch complicated oppo&s;ition occa|&s;ioned, had awakened all the pa&s;&s;ions of his &s;on, this ra&s;h young man might be prevailed upon to &s;ecure her for his own by the indi&s;&s;oluble vow. On the other hand, he dreaded the effect of Vivaldi's de&s;pair, &s;hould he fail in the pur&s;uit; and thus, fearing at one moment that for which he wi&s;hed in the next, the Marche&s;e &s;uffered a tumult of mind inferior only to his &s;on's.</P>
<P>The in&s;tructions, which he delivered to the &s;ervants whom he &s;ent in pur&s;uit of Vivaldi, were given under &s;uch di&s;traction of thought, that &s;carcely any per&s;on perfectly under&s;tood his commi&s;&s;ion; and, as the Mar|che&s;a had been careful to conceal from him her know|ledge
<PB N="161" REF="032735_0159_0FF49469B56E8B08">
of Ellena's abode, he gave no direction con|cerning the route to San Stefano.</P>
<P>While the Marche&s;e at Naples was thus employed, and while Schedoni was forming further plans again&s;t Ellena, Vivaldi was wandering from village to village, and from town to town, in pur&s;uit of her, whom all his efforts had hitherto been un&s;ucce&s;sful to recover. From the people at the po&s;t-hou&s;e at Bracelli, he had obtained little information that could direct him; they only knew that a carriage, &s;uch as had been already de&s;cribed to Vivaldi, with the blinds drawn up, chang|ed hor&s;es there that morning, which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">membered to be that of Ellena's departure, and had proceeded on the road to Morgagni.</P>
<P>When Vivaldi arrived thither, all trace of Ellena was lo&s;t; the ma&s;ter of the po&s;t could not recollect a &s;ingle circum&s;tance connected with the travellers, and even if he had noticed them, it would have been in&s;ufficient for Vivaldi's purpo&s;e, unle&s;s he had al&s;o ob&s;erved the road they followed; for at this place &s;e|veral roads branched off into oppo&s;ite quarters of the country; Vivaldi, therefore, was reduced to chu&s;e of the&s;e as chance or fancy directed; and as it appeared probable that the Marche&s;a had conveyed Ellena to a convent, he determined to make enquires at every one on his way.</P>
<P>He had now pa&s;&s;ed over &s;ome of the wilde&s;t tracts of the Appennine, among &s;cenes which &s;eemed aban|doned by civilized &s;ociety to the banditti who haunted their rece&s;&s;es. Yet even here amid&s;t wilds, that were nearly inacce&s;&s;ible, convents, with each its &s;mall de|pendent hamlet, were &s;cattered, and &s;hrouded from the world by woods and mountains, enjoyed un&s;u&s;pected|ly many of its luxuries, and di&s;played unnoticed, &s;ome of its elegance. Vivaldi, who had vi&s;ited &s;everal of the&s;e in &s;earch of Ellena, had been &s;urpri&s;ed at the
<PB N="162" REF="032735_0160_0FF47039320B66C0">
refined courte&s;y and ho&s;pitality with which he was received.</P>
<P>It was on the &s;eventh day of his journey, and near &s;un-&s;et, that he was bewildered in the woods of Rugi|eri. He had received a direction for the road he was to take at a village &s;ome leagues di&s;tant, and had obey|ed it confidently till now, when the path was lo&s;t in &s;everal tracts that branched out among the trees. The day was clo&s;ing, and Vivaldi's &s;pirits began to fail, but Paulo, light of heart and ever gay, commend|ed the &s;hade and plea&s;ant fre&s;hne&s;s of the woods, and ob&s;erved, that if his ma&s;ter did lo&s;e his way, and was obliged to remain here for the night, it could not be very unlucky, for they could climb among the branches of a che&s;nut, and find a more neat and airy lodging than any inn had yet afforded them.</P>
<P>While Paulo was thus endeavouring to make the be&s;t of what might happen, and his ma&s;ter was &s;unk in reverie, they &s;uddenly heard the &s;ound of in&s;tru|ments and voices from a di&s;tance. The gloom, which the trees threw round, prevented their di&s;tingui&s;h|ing objects afar off, and not a &s;ingle human being was vi&s;ible, nor any trace of his art, beneath the &s;ha|dowy &s;cene. They li&s;tened to a&s;certain from what direction the &s;ounds approached, and heard a chorus of voices, accompanied by a few in&s;truments, perform|ing the evening &s;ervice.</P>
<P>"We are near a convent, Signor," &s;aid Paulo, "li&s;ten! they are at their devotions."</P>
<P>"It is as you &s;ay," replied Vivaldi; "and we will make the be&s;t of our way towards it."</P>
<P>"Well, Signor! I mu&s;t &s;ay, if we find as good do|ings here as we had at the Capuchin's, we &s;hall have no rea&s;on to regret our beds <HI>alfre&s;co</HI> among the che&s;|nut branches."</P>
<P>"Do you perceive any walls or &s;pires beyond the trees?" &s;aid Vivaldi, as he led the way.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="032735_0161_0FF4947616FA9950">
"None, Signor," replied Paulo; "yet we draw nearer the &s;ounds. Ah, Signor? do you hear that note? How it dies away? And tho&s;e in&s;truments ju&s;t touched in &s;ymphony! This is not the mu&s;ic of pea&s;ants; a convent mu&s;t be near, though we do not &s;ee it."</P>
<P>Still as they advanced, no walls appeared, and &s;oon after the mu&s;ic cea&s;ed; but other &s;ounds led Vivaldi forward to a plea&s;ant part of the woods, where the trees opening, he perceived a party of pilgrims &s;eated on the gra&s;s. They were laughing and conver&s;ing with much gaiety, as each &s;pread before him the &s;upper, which he drew from his &s;crip; while he, who appear|ed to be the Father-Director of the pilgrimage, &s;at with a jovial countenance in the mid&s;t of the com|pany, di&s;pen&s;ing jokes and merry &s;tories, and receiving in return a tribute from every &s;crip. Wines of vari|ous &s;orts were ranged before him, of which he drank abundantly, and &s;eemed not, to refu&s;e any dainty that was offered.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who&s;e apprehen&s;ions were now quieted, &s;topped to ob&s;erve the groupe, as the evening rays, glancing along the &s;kirts of the wood, threw a gleam upon their various countenances, &s;hewing, however, in each a &s;pirit of gaiety that might have characteri&s;ed the individuals of a party of plea&s;ure, father than tho&s;e of a pilgrimage. The Father Director and his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lock &s;eemed perfectly to under each other; the Superior willingly re&s;igned the &s;olemn au&s;terity of his office, and permitted the company to make them&s;elves as happy as po&s;&s;ible, in con&s;ideration of receiving plenty of the mo&s;t delicate of their viands; yet &s;omewhat of dignity was mingled with his conde&s;cen&s;ions, that compelled them to receive even his jokes with a de|gree of deference, and perhaps they laughed at them le&s;s for their &s;pirit than becau&s;e they were favours.</P>
<P>Addre&s;&s;ing the Superior, Vivaldi reque&s;ted to be
<PB N="164" REF="032735_0162_0FF4703AD1A3E268">
directed how he might regain his way. The father examined him for a moment before he replied, but ob&s;erving the elegance of his dre&s;s, and a certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of di&s;tinction; and perceiving, al&s;o, that Paulo was his &s;ervant, he promi&s;ed his &s;ervices, and invited him to take a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at at his right hand, and partake of the &s;upper.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, under&s;tanding that the party was going his road, accepted the invitation, when Paulo, having fa&s;tened the hor&s;es to a tree, &s;oon became bu&s;y with the &s;upper. While Vivaldi conver&s;ed with the father, Paulo engro&s;ed all the attention of the pilgrims near him; they declared he was the clevere&s;t and the mer|rie&s;t fellow they had ever &s;een, and often expre&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a wi&s;h that he was going as far with them as to the &s;hrine in a convent of Carmelites which terminated their pilgrimage. When Vivaldi under&s;tood that this &s;hrine was in the church of a convent, partly inhabit|ed by nuns, and that it was little more than a league and a half di&s;tant, he determined to accompany them, for it was as po&s;&s;ible that Ellena was confined there as in any other cloi&s;ter; and of her being impri&s;oned in &s;ome convent, he had le&s;s doubt, the more he con&s;ider|ed the character and views of his mother. He &s;et forward, therefore, with the pilgrims, and on foot, having re&s;igned his hor&s;e to the weary Father-Di|rector.</P>
<P>Darkne&s;s clo&s;ed over them long before they reach|ed the village where they de&s;igned to pa&s;s the night; but they beguiled the way with &s;ongs and &s;tories, now and then only &s;topping at command of the Father, to repent &s;ome prayer or &s;ing a hymn. But, as they drew near a village, at the ba&s;e of the mountain on which the &s;hrine &s;tood, they halted to arrange them&s;elves in proce&s;&s;ion; and the Superior having &s;topped &s;hort in the mid&s;t of one of his be&s;t jokes, di&s;mounted Vival|di's hor&s;e, placed him&s;elf at their head, and beginning
<PB N="165" REF="032735_0163_0FF494779FA64798">
a loud &s;train, they proceeded in full chorus of melan|choly mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants hearing their &s;onorous voices, came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orth to meet and conduct them to their cabins. The village was already crowded with devotees, but the&s;e poor pea&s;ants, looking up to them with love and re|verence, made every po&s;&s;ible contrivance to accommo|date all who came; notwith&s;tanding which, when Paulo &s;oon after turned into his bed of &s;traw, he had more rea&s;ons than one to regret his che&s;nut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">attre&s;s.</P>
<P>Vivaldi pa&s;&s;ed an anxious night, waiting impati|ently for the dawning of that day, which might po&s;&s;i|bly re&s;tore to him Ellena. Con&s;idering that a pil|grim's habit would not only conceal him from &s;u&s;pi|cion, but allow him opportunities for ob&s;ervation, which his own dre&s;s would not permit, he employed Paulo to provide him one. The addre&s;s of the &s;er|vant, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a &s;ingle ducat, ea&s;ily procured it, and at an early hour he &s;et forward on his enquiry.</P>

<P>A FEW devotees only had begun to a&s;cend the mountain, and Vivaldi kept aloof even from the&s;e, pur&s;uing a lonely track, for his thoughtful mind de|&s;ired &s;olitude. The early breeze &s;ighing among the foliage, that waved high over the path, and the hol|low da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hing of di&s;tant waters, he li&s;tened to with com|placency, for the&s;e were &s;ounds which &s;oothed yet promoted his melancholy mood; and he &s;ometimes re&s;ted to gaze upon the &s;cenery around him, for this too was in harmony with the temper of his mind. Di&s;|appointment had &s;ubdued the wilder energy of his pa&s;|&s;ions, and produced a &s;olemn and lofty &s;tate of feeling; he viewed with plea&s;ing &s;adne&s;s the dark rocks and precipices, the gloomy mountains and va&s;t &s;olitudes, that &s;pread around him; nor was the convent that he was approaching a le&s;s &s;acred feature of the &s;cene, as its gray walls and pinacles appeared beyond the du&s;ky groves. "Ah! if it &s;hould enclo&s;e her!" &s;aid Vival|di, as he caught a fir&s;t glimp&s;e of its hall. "Vain hope! I will not invite your illu&s;ions again, I will not expo&s;e my&s;elf to the agonies of new di&s;appoint|ment; I will &s;earch, but not expect. Yet, if &s;he &s;hould be there!"</P>
<P>Having reached the gates of the convent, he pa&s;&s;|ed with ha&s;ty &s;teps into the court; where his emo|tion encrea&s;ed as he pau&s;ed a moment and looked round its &s;ilent cloi&s;ters. The porter only appeared, when Vivaldi, fearful le&s;t he &s;hould perceive him not to be a pilgrim, drew his hood over his face, and ga|thering up his garments &s;till clo&s;er in his folded arms,
<PB N="167" REF="032735_0165_0FF49479269D3160">
pa&s;&s;ed on without &s;peaking, though he know not which of the avenues before him led to the &s;hrine. He ad|vanced, however, towards the church, a &s;tately edi|fice, from the other parts of the convent. Its highly vaulted ai&s;les, extending in twilight per&s;pective, where a monk or a pilgrim only, now and then cro&s;&s;|ed, who&s;e dark figures, pa&s;&s;ing without &s;ound, vani&s;h|ed like &s;hadows; the univer&s;al &s;tillne&s;s of the place, the gleam of tapers from the high altar, and of lamps, which gave a gloomy pomp to every &s;hrine in the church: all the&s;e circum&s;tances con&s;pired to impre&s;s a &s;acred awe upon his heart.</P>
<P>He followed &s;ome devotees through a &s;ide ai&s;le to a court, that was overhung by a tremendous rock, in which was a cave, containing the &s;hrine of <HI>our Lady of Mount Carmel.</HI> This court was enclo&s;ed by the rock, and by the choir of the church, except that to the &s;outh a &s;mall opening led the eye to a glimp&s;e of the land|&s;cape below, which, &s;een beyond the dark jaws of the cliff, appeared free, and light, and gaily coloured, melt|ing away into the blue and di&s;tant mountains.</P>
<P>Vivaldi entered the cave, where, enclo&s;ed within a filigree &s;creen of gold, lay the image of the &s;aint, de|corated with flowers, and lighted up by innumer|able lamps and tapers. The &s;teps of the &s;hrine were thronged with kneeling pilgrims, and Vivaldi, to a|void &s;ingularity, kneeled al&s;o; till a high peal of the organ, at a di&s;tance, and the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">p voices of choiri&s;ters announced that the fir&s;t ma&s;s was begun. He left the cave, and, returning into the church, loitered at an extremity of the ai&s;les, where he li&s;tened awhile to the &s;olemn harmony pealing along the roofs, and &s;often|ing away in di&s;tance. It was &s;uch full and entranc|ing mu&s;ic as frequently &s;wells in the high fe&s;tivals of the Sicilian church, and is adapted to in&s;pire that &s;ub|lime enthu&s;ia&s;m, which &s;ometimes elevates its di&s;ci|ples. Vivaldi, unable to endure long the exce&s;s of

feeling, which this harmony awakened was leaving the church, when &s;uddenly it cea&s;ed, and the tolling of a bell &s;ounded in its &s;tead. This &s;eemed to be the knell of death, and it occurred to him, that a dying per|&s;on was approaching to receive the la&s;t &s;acrament; when he heard remotely a warbling of female voices, mingling with the deeper tones of the monks, and with the hollow note of the bell, as it &s;truck at intervals. So &s;weetly, &s;o plaintively, did the &s;train grow on the air, that tho&s;e who li&s;tened, as well as tho&s;e, who &s;ung, were touched with &s;orrow, and &s;eemed equally to mourn for a departing friend.</P>
<P>Vivaldi ha&s;tened to the choir, the pavement of which was &s;trewn with palm-branches and fre&s;h flow|ers. A pall of black velvet lay upon the &s;teps of the altar, where &s;everal prie&s;ts were &s;ilently attending. Every where appeared the en&s;igns of &s;olemn pomp and ceremony, and in every countenance the &s;tillne&s;s and ob&s;ervance of expectation. Meanwhile the &s;ounds draw nearer, and Vivaldi perceived a proce&s;&s;ion of nuns approaching from a di&s;tant ai&s;le.</P>
<P>As they advanced, he di&s;tingui&s;hed the lady abbe&s;s leading the train, dre&s;&s;ed in her pontifical robes, with the mitre on her head; and well he marked her &s;tately &s;tep, moving in time to the &s;low min&s;trel&s;y, and the air of proud yet graceful dignity, with which &s;he cha|racterized her&s;elf. Then followed the nuns, accord|ing to their &s;everal orders, and la&s;t came the novices, carrying lighted tapers, and &s;urrounded by other nuns, who were di&s;tingui&s;hed by a particular habit.</P>
<P>Having reached a part of the church appropriated for their reception, they arranged them&s;elves in order. Vivaldi, with a palpitating heart, enquired the occa|&s;ion of the ceremony, and was told that a nun was going to be profe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"You are informed, no doubt, brother," added th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> prior who gave him this intelligence, "that on the

morning of our high fe&s;tival, our Lady's day, it is u&s;ual for &s;uch as devote them&s;elves to heaven, to receive the veil. Stand bye a while, and you will &s;ee the ceremony.</P>
<P>"What is the name of the novice who is now to receive it?" &s;aid Vivaldi, in a voice who&s;e tremulous accents betrayed his emotion.</P>
<P>The friar glanced an eye of &s;crutiny upon him, as he replied, "I know not her name, but if you will &s;tep a little this way, I will point her out to you."</P>
<P>Vivaldi, drawing his hood over his face, obeyed in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"It is &s;he on the right of the abbe&s;s," &s;aid the &s;tranger, "who leans on the arm of a nun, &s;he is covered with a white veil, and is taller than her com|panions."</P>
<P>Vivaldi ob&s;erved her with a fearful eye, and though he did not recognize the per&s;on of Ellena, yet, whe|ther it was that his fancy was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with her image, or that there was truth in his &s;urmi&s;e, he thought he perceived a re&s;emblance of her. He enquired how long the novice had re&s;ided in the convent, and many other par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iculars, to which the &s;tranger could not or dared not reply.</P>
<P>With what anxious &s;olicitude did Vivaldi endeavour to look through the veils of &s;everal nuns in &s;earch of Ellena, whom he believed the barbarous policy of his mother might already have devoted to the cloi&s;ter! With a &s;olicitude &s;till &s;tronger he tried to catch a glimp&s;e of the features of the novices, but their faces were &s;haded by hoods, and their white veils, though thrown half back, were di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch artful folds that they concealed them from ob&s;ervation, as effectu|ally as did the pendant lawn the features of the nuns.</P>
<P>The ceremony began with the exhortation of the Father-Abbot, delivered with a &s;olemn energy; then the novice kneeling before him, made her pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="170" REF="032735_0168_0FF4704365043240">
for which Vivaldi li&s;tened with inten&s;e attention, but it was delivered in &s;uch low and trembling accents, that he could not a&s;certain even the tone. But dur|ing the anthem that mingled with the en&s;uing part of the &s;ervice, he thought he di&s;tingui&s;hed the voice of Ellena, that touching and well-known voice, which in the church of San Lorenzo had fir&s;t attracted his attention. He li&s;tened, &s;carcely daring to draw breath, le&s;t he &s;hould lo&s;e a note; and again he fancied her voice &s;poke in a part of the plaintive re&s;pon&s;e deliver|ed by the nuns.</P>
<P>Vivaldi endeavoured to command his emotion, and to await with patience &s;ome further unfolding of the truth; but when the prie&s;t prepared to withdraw the white veil from the face of the novice, and throw the black one over her, dreadful expectation that &s;he was Ellena &s;eized him, and he with difficulty forbore &s;tep|ping forward and di&s;covering him&s;elf on the in&s;tant.</P>
<P>The veil was at length withdrawn, and a very love|ly face appeared, but not Ellena's. Vivaldi breathed again, and waited with tolerable compo&s;ure for the conclu&s;ion of the ceremony; till in the &s;olemn &s;train that followed the putting on of the black veil, he heard again the voice, which he was now convinced was her's. Its accents were low, and mournful, and tremulous, yet his heart acknowledged in&s;tantaneou&s;|ly their magic influence.</P>
<P>When this ceremony had concluded, another began; and he was told it was that of a noviciation. A young woman, &s;upported by two nuns, advanced to the altar, and Vivaldi thought he beheld Ellena. The prie&s;t was beginning the cu&s;tomary exhortation, when &s;he lifted her half-veil, and, &s;hewing a counte|nance where meek &s;orrow was mingled with heavenly &s;weetne&s;s, rai&s;ed her blue eyes, all bathed in tears, and waved her hand as if &s;he would have &s;poken.&mdash;It was Ellena her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="032735_0169_0FF49486C53E50D0">
The pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t attempted to proceed.</P>
<P>"I prote&s;t in the pre&s;ence of this congregation," &s;aid &s;he &s;olemnly, "that I am brought hither to pro|nounce vows which my heart di&s;claims. I prote&s;t"&mdash;</P>
<P>A confu&s;ion of voices interrupted her, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;he perceived Vivaldi ru&s;hing towards the altar. Ellena gazed for a moment, and then, &s;tretching forth her &s;upplicating hands towards him, clo&s;ed her eyes, and &s;unk into the arms of &s;ome per|&s;ons round her, who vainly endeavoured to prevent him from approaching and a&s;&s;i&s;ting her. The angui&s;h, with which he bent over her lifele&s;s form, and called upon her name, excited the commi&s;eration even of the nuns, and e&s;pecially Olivia, who was mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous in efforts to revive her young friend.</P>
<P>When Ellena unclo&s;ed her eyes, and looking up, once more beheld Vivaldi, the expre&s;&s;ion with which &s;he regarded him, told that her heart was unchanged, and that &s;he was uncon&s;cious of the mi&s;eries of impri|&s;onment while he was with her. She de&s;ired to with|draw, and, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Vivaldi and Olivia, was leaving the church, when the abbe&s;s ordered that &s;he &s;hould be attended by the nuns only; and, retiring from the al|tar, &s;he gave directions that the young &s;tranger &s;hould be conducted to the parlour of the convent.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, though he refu&s;ed to obey an imperious command, yielded to the entreaties of Ellena, and to the gentle remon&s;trances of Olivia; and bidding El|lena farewell for a while, he repaired to the parlour of the abbe&s;s. He was not without &s;ome hope of awakening her to a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, or of pity; but he found that her notions of right were inexorably again&s;t him, and that pride and re&s;entment u&s;urped the in|fluence of every other feeling. She began her lecture with expre&s;&s;ing the warm friend&s;hip &s;he had &s;o long cheri&s;hed for the Marche&s;a, proceeded to lament that the &s;on of a friend, whom &s;he &s;o highly e&s;teemed,
<PB N="172" REF="032735_0170_0FF470453A463A68">
&s;hould have forgotten his duty to his parents, and the ob&s;ervance due to the dignity of his hou&s;e, &s;o far as to &s;eek connection with a per&s;on of Ellena di Ro&s;alba's inferior &s;tation; and concluded with a &s;evere repri|mand for having di&s;turbed the tranquility of her con|vent and the decorum of the church by his intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>Vivaldi li&s;tened with &s;ubmitting patience to this mention of morals and decorum from a per&s;on, who, with the mo&s;t perfect &s;elf-applau&s;e, was violating &s;ome of the plaine&s;t obligations of humanity and ju&s;tice; who had con&s;pired to tear an orphan from her home, and who de&s;igned to deprive her for life of liberty, with all the ble&s;&s;ings it inherits. But, when &s;he pro|ceeded to &s;peak of Ellena with the cau&s;tic of &s;evere reprobation, and to hint at the puni&s;hment, which her public rejection of the vows had incurred, the pati|ence of Vivaldi &s;ubmitted no longer; indignation and contempt ro&s;e high again&s;t the Superior, and he exhi|bited a portrait of her&s;elf in the &s;trong colours of truth. But the mind, which compa&s;&s;ion could not per&s;uade, rea&s;on could not appal; &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s had hardened it a|like to the influence of each; her pride only was affected, and &s;he retaliated the mortification &s;he &s;uffer|ed by menace and denunciation.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, on quitting her apartment, had no other re&s;ource than an application to the Abate, who&s;e in|fluence, at lea&s;t, if not his authority, might a&s;&s;uage the &s;everity of her power. In this Abate, a mildne&s;s of temper, and gentlene&s;s of manner were qualities of le&s;s value than is u&s;ually and de&s;ervedly imputed to them; for, being connected with feeblene&s;s of mind, they were but the plea&s;ing merits of ea&s;y times, which in an hour of difficulty never a&s;&s;umed the character of virtues, by inducing him to &s;erve tho&s;e, for whom he might feel. And thus, with a temper and di&s;po&s;ition directly oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of the &s;evere and violent ab|be&s;s, he was equally &s;elfi&s;h, and almo&s;t equally culpa|ble,
<PB N="173" REF="032735_0171_0FF494884B805600">
&s;ince by permitting evil, he was nearly as injuri|ous in his conduct as tho&s;e who planned it. Indolence and timidity, a timidity the con&s;equence of want of clear perception, deprived him of all energy of cha|racter; he was prudent rather than wi&s;e, and &s;o fear|ful of being thought to do wrong that he &s;eldom did right.</P>
<P>To Vivaldi's temperate repre&s;entations and earne&s;t entreaties that he would exert &s;ome authority towards liberating Ellena, he li&s;tened with patience; acknow|ledged the hard&s;hips of her &s;ituation; lamented the unhappy divi&s;ions between Vivaldi and his family, and then declined advancing a &s;ingle &s;tep in &s;o delicate an affair. Signora di Ro&s;alba, he &s;aid, was in the care of the abbe&s;s, over whom he had no right of control in matters relative to her dome&s;tic concerns. Vivaldi then &s;upplicated, that, though he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no authority, he would, at lea&s;t, intercede or remon&s;trate again&s;t &s;o unju&s;t a procedure as that of detaining Ellena a pri|&s;oner, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in re&s;toring her to the home, from which &s;he had been forcibly carried.</P>
<P>"And this, again," replied the Abate, "does not come within my juri&s;diction; and I make it a rule not to encroach upon that of another per&s;on."</P>
<P>"And can you endure, holy father," &s;aid Vivaldi, "to witne&s;s a flagrant act of inju&s;tice and not endea|vour to counteract it? not even &s;tep forward to re&s;cue the victim when you perceive the preparation for the &s;acrifice?"</P>
<P>"I repeat, that I never interfere with the authority of others," replied the Superior; "having a&s;&s;erted my own, I yield to them in their &s;phere, the obedience which I require in mine."</P>
<P>Is power then," &s;aid Vivaldi, "the infallible te&s;t of ju&s;tice? Is it morality to obey where the command is criminal? The whole world have a claim upon the fortitude, the active fortitude of tho&s;e who are placed

as you are, between the alternative of confirming a wrong by your con&s;ent, or preventing it by your re|&s;i&s;tance. Would that your heart expanded towards that world, reverend father!"</P>
<P>"Would that the whole world were wrong that you might have the glory of &s;etting it right!" &s;aid the Abate, &s;miling. "Young man! you are an en|thu&s;ia&s;t, and I pardon you. You are a knight of chi|valry, who would go about the earth fighting with every body by way of proving your right to do good; it is unfortunate that you were born &s;omewhat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> late."</P>
<P>"Enthu&s;ia&s;m in the cau&s;e of humanity"&mdash;&s;aid Vi|valdi, but he checked him&s;elf; and de&s;pairing of touch|ing a heart &s;o hardened by &s;elfi&s;h prudence, and indig|nant at beholding an apathy &s;o vicious in its con&s;e|quence, he left the Abate without other effort. He perceived that he mu&s;t now have recour&s;e to further &s;tratagem, a recour&s;e which his frank and noble mind dete&s;ted, but he had already tried without &s;ucce&s;s, eve|ry other po&s;&s;ibility of re&s;cuing the innocent victim of the Marche&s;a's prejudice and pride.</P>
<P>Ellena meanwhile had retired to her cell, agitated by a variety of con&s;iderations, and contrary emotions, of which, however, tho&s;e of joy and tenderne&s;s were long predominant. Then came anxiety, apprehen&s;i|on, pride, and doubt, to divide and torture her heart. It was true that Vivaldi had di&s;covered her pri&s;on, but, if it were po&s;&s;ible, that he could relea&s;e her, &s;he mu&s;t con&s;ent to quit it with him; a &s;tep from which a mind &s;o tremblingly jealous of propriety as hers, re|coiled with alarm, though it would deliver her from captivity. And how, when &s;he con&s;idered the haugh|ty character of the Marche&s;e di Vivaldi, the imperious and vindictive nature of the Marche&s;a, and, &s;till mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, their united repugnance to a connection with her, how could &s;he endure to think, even for a moment, of in|truding

her&s;elf into &s;uch a family! Pride, delicacy, good &s;en&s;e &s;eemed to warn her again&s;t a conduct &s;o humiliating and vexatious in its con&s;equences, and to exhort her to pre&s;erve her own dignity by indepen|dence, but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;teem, the friend&s;hip, the tender af|fection, which &s;he had cheri&s;hed for Vivaldi, made her pau&s;e, and &s;hrink with emotions, of little le&s;s than horror, from the eternal renunciation, which &s;o dig|nified a choice required. Though the encourage|ment, which her decea&s;ed relative had given to this at|tachment, &s;eemed to impart to it a &s;acred character, that con&s;iderably &s;oothed the alarmed delicacy of El|lena, the approbation thus implied, had no power to &s;ilence her own objections, and &s;he would have re|gretted the mi&s;taken zeal, which had contributed to lead her into the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ituation, had &s;he revered the memory of her aunt, or loved Vivaldi, le&s;s. Still, however, the joy, which his pre&s;ence had occa&s;i|oned, and which the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that he was &s;till near her had prolonged, was not &s;ubdued, though it was frequently ob&s;cured by &s;uch anxious con&s;iderati|ons. With jealous and indi&s;creet &s;olicitude, &s;he now recollected every look, and the accent of every word, which had told that his affection was undimini&s;hed, thus &s;eeking, with incon&s;i&s;tent zeal for a conviction of the very tenderne&s;s, which but a moment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">efore &s;he had thought it would be prudent to lament, and almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to renounce.</P>
<P>She awaited with extreme anxiety the appearance of Olivia, who probably might know the re&s;ult of Vivaldi's conference with the abbe&s;s, and whether he was yet in the convent.</P>
<P>In the evening Olivia came, a me&s;&s;enger of evil; and Ellena, informed of the conduct of the abbe&s;s, and the con&s;equent departure of Vivaldi, perceived all her courage, and all the half-formed re&s;olutions, which a con&s;ideration of his family had &s;ugge&s;ted, faulter and

expire. Sen&s;ible only of grief and de&s;pondency, &s;he a&s;certained, for the fir&s;t time the extent of her affection and the &s;everity of her &s;ituation. She perceived, al&s;o, that the inju&s;tice which his family had exerci&s;ed to|wards her, ab&s;olved her from all con&s;ideration of their di&s;plea&s;ure, otherwi&s;e than as it might affect her&s;elf; but this was a conviction, which it were now proba|bly u&s;ele&s;s to admit.</P>
<P>Olivia not only expre&s;&s;ed the tendere&s;t intere&s;t in her welfare but &s;eemed deeply affected with her &s;itu|ation; and, whether it was, that the nun's misfortunes bore &s;ome re&s;emblance to Ellena's, or from whatever cau&s;e, it is remarkable that her eyes were often filled with tears, while &s;he regarded her young friend, and &s;he betrayed &s;o much emotion that Ellena noticed it with &s;urpri&s;e. She was, however, too delicate to hint any curio&s;ity on the &s;ubject; and too much engaged by a nearer intere&s;t to dwell long upon the circum|&s;tance.</P>
<P>When Olivia withdrew, Ellena retired to her tur|ret, to &s;oothe her &s;pirits with a view of &s;erene and maje&s;tic nature, a recour&s;e which &s;eldom failed to ele|vate her mind and &s;often the a&s;perities of affliction.&mdash;It was to her like &s;weet and &s;olemn mu&s;ic, breathing peace over the &s;oul&mdash;like the oaten &s;top of Milton's Spirit,

<P>While &s;he &s;at before a window, ob&s;erving the even|ing light beaming upon the valley, and touching all the di&s;tant mountains with mi&s;ty purple, a reed as &s;weet, though not as fanciful, &s;ounded from among the rocks below. The in&s;trument and the character of the &s;train were &s;uch as &s;he had been unaccu&s;tomed to hear
<PB N="177" REF="032735_0175_0FF49489D2371DD0">
within the walls of San Stefano, and the tone diffu&s;ed over her &s;pirits a plea&s;ing melancholy, that rapt all her attention. The liquid cadence as it trembled and &s;unk away, &s;eemed to tell the dejection of no vulgar feelings, and the exqui&s;ite ta&s;te, with which the com|plaining notes again &s;welled, almo&s;t convinced her, that the mu&s;ician was Vivaldi.</P>
<P>On looking from the lattice, &s;he perceived a per&s;on perched on a point of the cliff below, whither it ap|peared almo&s;t impracticable for any human &s;tep to have climbed, and pre&s;erved from the precipice only by &s;ome dwarf &s;hrubs that fringed the brow. The twilight did not permit her immediately to a&s;certain whether it was Vivaldi, and the &s;ituation was &s;o dan|gerous that &s;he hoped it was not he. Her doubts were removed, when, looking up, he perceived Elle|na, and &s;he heard his voice.</P>
<P>Vivaldi had learned from a lay-brother of the con|vent, whom Paulo had bribed, and who when he work|ed in the garden, had &s;ometimes &s;een Ellena at the window, that &s;he frequented this remote turret; and, at the hazard of his life, he had now ventured thither, with a hope of conver&s;ing with her.</P>
<P>Ellena, alarmed at his tremendus &s;ituation, refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to him, but he would not leave the &s;pot till he had communicated a plan concerted for her e&s;cape, and, entreating that &s;he would confide her&s;elf to his care, a&s;&s;ured her &s;he would be conducted wherever &s;he judged proper. It appeared that the brother had con|&s;ented to a&s;&s;i&s;t his views, in con&s;ideration of an ample reward, and to admit him within the walls on this evening, when, in his pilgrim's habit, he might have an opportunity of again &s;eeing Ellena. He conjured her to attend, if po&s;&s;ible, in the convent parlour dur|ing &s;upper, explaining, in a few words, the motive for this reque&s;t, and the &s;ub&s;tance of the following particulars:</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="032735_0176_0FF4704F98E11078">
The Lady-abbe&s;s, in ob&s;ervance of the cu&s;tom up|on high fe&s;tivals, gave a collation to the <HI>Padre-abate,</HI> and &s;uch of the prie&s;ts as had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the ve&s;per-&s;ervice. A few &s;trangers of di&s;tinction and pilgrims were al&s;o to partake of the entertainments of this night, among which was included a concert to be performed by the nuns. At the collation was to be di&s;played a profu&s;ion of delicacies, arranged by the &s;i&s;ters, who had been bu&s;y in preparing the pa&s;try and confectionary du|ring &s;everal days, and who excelled in the&s;e articles no le&s;s than in embroid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ry and other ingenious arts. This &s;upper was to be given in the abbe&s;s's outer parlour, while &s;he her&s;elf, attended by &s;ome nuns of high rank, and a few favourites, was to have a table in the in|ner apartment, where, &s;eparated only by the grate, &s;he could partake of the conver&s;ation of the holy fa|thers. The tables were to be ornamented with arti|ficial flowers, and a variety of other fanciful devices upon which the ingenuity of the &s;i&s;ters had been long employed, who prepared for the&s;e fe&s;tivals with as much vanity, and expected them to di&s;&s;ipate the gloomy monotony of their u&s;ual life, with as much eagerne&s;s of delight, as a young beauty anticipates a fir&s;t ball.</P>
<P>On this evening, therefore, every member of the convent would be engaged either by amu&s;ement or bu&s;ine&s;s, and to Vivaldi, who had been careful to in|form him&s;elf of the&s;e circum&s;tances, it would be ea&s;y, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the brother, to obtain admittance, and mingle him&s;elf among the &s;pectators, di&s;gui&s;ed in his pilgrim's habit. He entreated, therefore, that El|lena would contrive to be in the abbe&s;s's apartment this evening, when he would endeavour to convey to her &s;ome further particulars of the plan of e&s;cape, and would have mules in waiting at the foot of the moun|tain, to conduct her to the villa Altieri, or to the neighbouring convent of the Santa della Pieta. Vi|valdi &s;ecretly hoped that &s;he might be prevailed with
<PB N="179" REF="032735_0177_0FF494942EE0FA00">
to give him her hand on quitting San Stefano, but he forbore to mention this hope, le&s;t it &s;hould he mi&s;|taken for a condition, and that Ellena might be either reluctant to accept his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or, accepting it, might con&s;ider her&s;elf bound to grant a ha&s;ty con&s;ent.</P>
<P>To his mention of e&s;cape &s;he li&s;tened with varying emotion; at one moment attending to it with hope and joy, as promi&s;ing her the only chance of liberation from an impri&s;onment, which was probably intended to la&s;t for her life, and of re&s;toring her to Vivaldi; and at another, recoiling from the thought of departing with him, while his family was &s;o decidedly aver&s;e to their marriage. Thus, unable to form any in&s;tant re&s;olution on the &s;ubject, and entreating that he would leave his dangerous &s;tation before the thickening twi|light &s;hould encrea&s;e the hazard of his de&s;cent, Ellena, added, that &s;he would endeavour to obtain admittance to the apartment of the abbe&s;s, and to acquaint him with her final determination. Vivaldi under&s;tood all the delicacy of her &s;cruples, and though they afflicted him, he honoured the good &s;en&s;e and ju&s;t pride that &s;ugge&s;ted them.</P>
<P>He lingered on the rock till the la&s;t moments of de|parting light, and then, with a heart fluttering with hopes and fears, bade Ellena farewel, and de&s;cended; while &s;he watched his progre&s;s thro' the &s;ilent gloom, faintly di&s;tingui&s;hing him gliding along ledges of the precipice, and making his adventurous way from cliff to cliff, till the winding thick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s concealed him from her view. Still anxious, &s;he remained at the lattice, but he appeared no more; no voice announced di&s;|a&s;ter; and, at length, &s;he returned to her cell, to deli|berate on the &s;ubject of her departure.</P>
<P>Her con&s;iderations were interrupted by Olivia, whofe manner indicated &s;omething extraordinary; the u&s;ual tranquility of her countenance was gone, and an air of grief mingled with apprehen&s;ion appeared there.
<PB N="180" REF="032735_0178_0FF470514DB44148">
Before &s;he &s;poke, &s;he exammined the pa&s;&s;age and looked round the cell. "It is as I feared," &s;aid &s;he abruptly; "my &s;u&s;picions are ju&s;tified, and you, my child, are &s;acrificed, unle&s;s it were po&s;&s;ible for you to quit the convent this night."</P>
<P>"What is it that you mean?" &s;aid the alarmed Ellena.</P>
<P>"I have ju&s;t learned," re&s;umed the nun, "that your conduct this morning, which is under&s;tood to have thrown a premeditated in&s;ult upon the abbe&s;s, is to be puni&s;hed with what they call impri&s;onment; alas! why &s;hould I &s;often the truth&mdash;with what I believe is death it&s;elf, for who ever returned alive from that hi|deous chamber!"</P>
<P>"With death!" &s;aid Ellena, agha&s;t; "Oh, heavens! how have I de&s;erved death?"</P>
<P>"That is not the que&s;tion, my daughter, but how you may avoid it. Within the deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es of our convent, is a &s;tone chamber, &s;ecured by doors of iron, to which &s;uch of the &s;i&s;terhood as have been guilty of any heinous offence have, from time to time, been con|&s;igned. This condemnation admits of no reprieve; the unfortunate captive is left to langui&s;h in chains and darkne&s;s, receiving only an allowance of bread and water ju&s;t &s;ufficient to prolong her &s;ufferings, till nature at length, &s;inking under their intolerable pre&s;|&s;ure, obtains refuge in death. Our records relate &s;everal in&s;tances of &s;uch horrible puni&s;hment, which has generally been inflicted upon nuns, who, weary of the life which they have cho&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n under the fir&s;t delu|&s;ions of the imagination, or which they have been compelled to accept by the rigour or a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rice of parents, have been detected in e&s;caping from the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ent."</P>
<P>The nun pau&s;ed, but Ellena remaining rapt in &s;ilent thought, &s;he re&s;umed: "One mi&s;erable in&s;tance of this &s;everity has occurred within my memory. I &s;aw

During nearly two years &s;he langui&s;hed upon a bed of &s;traw, denied even the poor con&s;olation of conver&s;ing through the grate with &s;uch of the &s;i&s;ters as pitied her; and who of us was there that did not pity her! A &s;evere puni&s;hment was threatened to tho&s;e, who &s;hould approach with any compa&s;&s;ionate intention; thank God! I incurred it, and I endured it, al&s;o with &s;ecret triumph."</P>
<P>A gleam of &s;atisfaction pa&s;&s;ed over Olivia's coun|tenance as &s;he &s;poke this; it was the &s;weete&s;t that Ellena had ever ob&s;erved there. With a &s;ympathetic emotion, &s;he threw her&s;elf on the bo&s;om of the nun, and wept; for &s;ome moments they were both &s;ilent. Olivia, at length &s;aid, "Do you not believe, my child, that the officious and offended abbe&s;s will readily &s;eize upon the circum&s;tance of your di&s;obedience, as a pre|tence for confining you in that fatal chamber? The wi&s;hes of the Marche&s;a will thus &s;urely be accom|pli&s;hed, without the difficulty of exacting your obe|dience to the vows. Alas! I have received proof too ab&s;olute of her intention, and that to-morrow is a&s;|&s;igned as the day of your &s;acrifice; you may, perhaps, be thankful that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the fe&s;tival has obliged her to defer executing the &s;entence even till to-morrow."</P>
<P>Ellena replied only with a groan as her head &s;till drooped upon the &s;houlder of the nun; &s;he was not now he&s;itating whether to accept the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Vi|valdi, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> de&s;ponding le&s;t his utmo&s;t efforts for her deliverance &s;hould be vain.</P>
<P>Olivia, who mi&s;took the cau&s;e of her &s;ilence, added, "Other hints I could give, which are &s;trong as they are dreadful, but I will forbear. Tell me how it is po&s;&s;ible I may a&s;&s;i&s;t you; I am willing to incur a &s;e|cond

puni&s;hment, in endeavouring to relieve a &s;econd &s;ufferer."</P>
<P>Ellena's tears flowed fa&s;t at this new in&s;tance of the nun's genero&s;ity. "But if they &s;hould di&s;cover you in a&s;&s;i&s;ting me to leave the convent," &s;he &s;aid in a voice convul&s;ed by her gratitude,&mdash;"O! if they &s;hould di&s;cover you!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I can a&s;certain the puni&s;hment," Olivia replied with firmne&s;s, "and do not fear to meet it."</P>
<P>"How nobly generous this is!" &s;aid the weeping Ellena; "I ought not to &s;uffer you to be thus care|le&s;s of your&s;elf!"</P>
<P>"My conduct is not wholly di&s;intere&s;ted," the nun mode&s;ty replied; "for I think I could endure any puni&s;hment with more fortitude than the &s;ickening angui&s;h of beholding &s;uch &s;uffering as I have wit|ne&s;&s;ed. What are bodily pains in compari&s;on with the &s;ubtile, the exqui&s;ite tortures of the mind! Hea|ven knows I can &s;upport my own afflictions, but not the view of tho&s;e of others when they are exce&s;&s;ive. The in&s;truments of torture I believe I could endure, if my &s;pirit was invigorated with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a generous purpo&s;e; but pity touches upon a nerve that vibrates in&s;tantly to the heart, and &s;ubdues re&s;i&s;t|ance. Yes, my child, the agony of pity is keener than any other, except that of remor&s;e, and even in remor&s;e, it is, perhaps, the mingling unavailing pity, that points the &s;ting. But while I am indulging this egoti&s;m, I am, perhaps, encrea&s;ing your danger of the &s;uffering I deprecate."</P>
<P>Ellena, thus encouraged by the generous &s;ympathy of Olivia, mentioned Vivaldi's propo&s;ed vi&s;it of this evening; and con&s;ulted with her on the probability of procuring admittance for her&s;elf to the abbe&s;s's parlour. Reanimated by this intelligence, Olivia ad|vi&s;ed her to repair not only to the &s;uppe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">-room, but to attend the previous concert, to which &s;everal &s;trangers
<PB N="183" REF="032735_0181_0FF49497422122B0">
would be admitted, among whom might probably be Vivaldi, When to this Ellena objected her dread of the abbe&s;s's ob&s;ervation, and of the immediate &s;eclu&s;ion that would follow, Olivia &s;oothed her &s;ears of di&s;co|very, by offering her the di&s;gui&s;e of a nun's veil, and promi&s;ing not only to conduct her to the apartment, but to afford her every po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards her e&s;cape.</P>
<P>"Among the crowd of nuns, who will attend in that &s;pacious apartmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">," Olivia added, "it is impro|bable you would be di&s;tingui&s;hed, even if the &s;i&s;ters were le&s;s occupied by amu&s;ement, and the abbe&s;s were at lei&s;ure to &s;crutinize. As it is, you will hazard little danger of di&s;covery; the Superior, if &s;he thinks of you at all, will believe that you are &s;till a pri&s;oner in your cell, but this is an evening of too much im|portance to her vanity for any con&s;ideration, di&s;tinct from that emotion, to divide her attention. Let hope, therefore, &s;upport you, my child, and do you prepare a few lines to acquaint Vivaldi with your con&s;ent to his propo&s;al, and with the urgency of your circum|&s;tances; you may, perhaps, find an opportunity of conveying them through the grate."</P>
<P>They were &s;till conver&s;ing on this &s;ubject, when a particular chime &s;ounded, which Olivia &s;aid &s;ummon|ed the nuns to the concert-room; and &s;he immediate|ly ha&s;tened for a black veil, while Ellena wrote a few lines that were nece&s;&s;ary for Vivaldi.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WRAPT in Olivia's veil, Ellena de&s;cended to the mu&s;ic-room, and mingled with the nuns, who were a&s;&s;embled within the grate. Among the monks and pilgrims without it, were &s;ome &s;trangers in the u&s;ual dre&s;s of the country, but &s;he did not perceive any per&s;on who re&s;embled Vivaldi; and &s;he con&s;idered, that, if he were pre&s;ent, he would not venture to di&s;|cover him&s;elf, while her nun's veil concealed her as effectually from him as from the lady abbe&s;s. It would be nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to &s;eek an opportunity of with|drawing it for a moment at the grate, an expedient, which mu&s;t certainly expo&s;e her to the notice of &s;trangers.</P>
<P>On the entrance of the lady Abbe&s;s, Ellena's fear of ob&s;ervation rendered her in&s;en&s;ible to every other con|&s;ideration; &s;he fancied, that the eyes of the Superior were particularly directed upon her&s;elf. The veil &s;eemed an in&s;ufficient protection from their penetrat|ing glances, and &s;he almo&s;t &s;unk with terror of in&s;tant di&s;covery.</P>
<P>The Abbe&s;s, however, pa&s;&s;ed on, and, having con|ver&s;ed for a few moments with the <HI>padre Abate</HI> and &s;ome vi&s;itors of di&s;tinction, took her chair; and the per|formance immediately opened with one of tho&s;e &s;o|lemn and impre&s;&s;ive airs, which the Italian nuns know how to give with &s;o much ta&s;te and &s;weetne&s;s. It re|&s;cued even Ellena for a moment from a &s;en&s;e of dan|ger, and &s;he re&s;igned her&s;elf to the &s;urrounding &s;cene, of which the <HI>coup-d' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">il,</HI> was &s;triking and grand. In
<PB N="185" REF="032735_0183_0FF49498C9583640">
a vaulted apartment of con&s;iderable extent, lighted by innumerable tapers, and where even the ornaments, though pompous, partook of the &s;olemn character of the in&s;titution, were a&s;&s;embled about fifty nuns, who, in the intere&s;ting habit of their order, appeared with graceful plainne&s;s. The delicacy of their air, and their beauty, &s;oftened by the lawn that thinly veiled it, were contra&s;ted by the &s;evere maje&s;ty of the lady Ab|be&s;s, who, &s;eated on an elevated chair, apart from the audience, &s;eemed the empre&s;s of the &s;cene, and by the venerable figures of the Father Abate, and his attendant monks, who were arranged without that &s;creen of wire-work, extending the whole breadth of the apart|ment, which is called the grate. Near the holy father were placed the &s;trangers of di&s;tinction, dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;plendid Neapolitan habit, who&s;e gay colouring and airy elegance oppo&s;ed well with the dark drapery of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics; their plumed hats loftily overtopping the half-cowled heads and grey locks of the monks. Nor was the contra&s;t of countenances le&s;s &s;triking; the grave, the au&s;tere, the &s;olemn, and the gloomy, intermingling with the light, the blooming, and the debonnaire, expre&s;&s;ed all the various tempers, that render life a ble&s;&s;ing or a burden, and, as with the &s;pell of magic, transform this world into a tran&s;ient paradi&s;e or purgatory. In the back ground of the picture &s;tood &s;ome pilgrims, with looks le&s;s joyous and more demure than they had worn on the road the preceding day; and among them were &s;ome inferior brothers and attendants of the convent. To this part of the chamber Ellena frequently directed her atten|tion, but did not di&s;tingui&s;h Vivaldi; and, though &s;he had taken a &s;tation near the grate, &s;he had not courage indecorou&s;ly to withdraw her veil before &s;o many &s;trangers. And thus, if he even were in the apart|ment, it was not probable he would venture to come forward.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="032735_0184_0FF47059D61778C8">
The concert concluded without his having been di&s;covered by Ellena, and &s;he withdrew to the apart|ment where the collation was &s;pread, and where the Ab|be&s;s and her gue&s;ts &s;oon after appeared. Pre&s;ently &s;he ob&s;erved a &s;tranger, in a pilgrim's habit, &s;tation him|&s;elf near the grate; his face was partly muffled in his cloak, and he &s;eemed to be a &s;pectator rather than a partaker of the fea&s;t.</P>
<P>Ellena, who under&s;tood this to be Vivaldi, was watchful for an opportunity of approaching, un&s;een by the abbe&s;s, the place where he had fixed him&s;elf. Engaged in conver&s;ation with the ladies around her, the Superior &s;oon favoured Ellena's wi&s;h, who, hav|ing reached the grate, ventured to lift her veil for one in&s;tant. The &s;tranger, letting his cloak fall, thanked her with his eyes for her conde&s;cen&s;ion, and &s;he per|ceived, that he was not Vivaldi! Shocked at the in|terpretation which might be given to a conduct appa|rently &s;o improper, as much as by the di&s;appointment, which Vivaldi's ab&s;ence occa&s;ioned, &s;he was ha&s;tily retiring, when another &s;tranger approached with quick &s;teps, whom &s;he in&s;tantly knew, by the grace and &s;pi|rit of his air, to be Vivaldi; but determined not to expo&s;e her&s;elf a &s;econd time to the po&s;&s;ibility of a mi&s;|take, &s;he awaited for &s;ome further &s;ignal of his identity, before &s;he di&s;covered her&s;elf. His eyes were fixed upon her in earne&s;t attention for &s;ome moments, be|fore he drew a&s;ide the cloak from his face. But he &s;oon did &s;o;&mdash;and it was Vivaldi him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Ellena, perceiving that &s;he was known, did not rai&s;e her veil, but advanced a few &s;teps towards the grate. Vivaldi there depo&s;ited a &s;mall folded paper, and be|fore &s;he could venture to deliver her own billet, he had retired among the crowd. As &s;he &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pped forward to &s;ecure his letter, &s;he ob&s;erved a nun ha&s;tily ap|proach the &s;pot where he had laid it, and &s;he pau&s;ed. The garment of the Reclu&s;e wafted it from the place
<PB N="187" REF="032735_0185_0FF494A32EF91DB0">
where it had been partly concealed; and when Ellena perceived the nun's foot re&s;t upon the paper, &s;he with difficulty di&s;gui&s;ed her apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>A friar, who from without the grate addre&s;&s;ed the &s;i&s;ter, &s;eemed with much earne&s;tne&s;s, yet with a cer|tain air of &s;ecre&s;y, communicating &s;ome important in|telligence. The fears of Ellena &s;ugge&s;ted that he had ob&s;erved the action of Vivaldi, and was making known his &s;u&s;picions; and &s;he expected, every in&s;tant, to &s;ee the nun lift up the paper, and deliver it to the abbe&s;s.</P>
<P>From this immediate apprehen&s;ion, however, &s;he was relea&s;ed when the &s;i&s;ter pu&s;hed it gently a&s;ide, without examination, a circum&s;tance that not le&s;s &s;ur|pri&s;ed than relieved her. But, when the conference broke up, the friar, ha&s;tily retreating among the crowd, di&s;appeared from the apartment, and the nun approached and whi&s;pered the Superior, all her terrors were renew|ed. She &s;carcely doubted that Vivaldi was detected, and that his letter was de&s;ignedly left where it had been depo&s;ited, for the purpo&s;e of alluring her to be|tray her&s;elf. Trembling, di&s;mayed, and almo&s;t &s;ink|ing with apprehen&s;ion, &s;he watched the countenance of the Abbe&s;s, while the nun addre&s;&s;ed her, and thought &s;he read her own fate in the frown that appeared there.</P>
<P>Whatever might be the intentions or the directions of the Superior, no active mea&s;ure was at pre&s;ent em|ployed; the Reclu&s;e, having received an an&s;wer, re|tired quietly among the &s;i&s;ters, and the Abbe&s;s re&s;umed her u&s;ual manner. Ellena, however, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he was now ob&s;erved, did not dare to &s;eize the paper, though &s;he believed it contained momentous informa|tion, and feared that the time was now e&s;caping which might facilitate her deliverance. Whenever &s;he ven|tured to look round, the eyes of the Abbe&s;s &s;eemed pointed upon her, and &s;he judged from the po&s;ition of the nun, for the veil concealed her face, that &s;he al&s;o was vigilantly regarding her.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="032735_0186_0FF4705B913303E0">
Above an hour had elap&s;ed in this &s;tate of anxious &s;u&s;pen&s;e, when the collation concluded, and the a&s;&s;em|bly broke up; during the general bu&s;tle of which, Ellena ventured to the grate, and &s;ecured the paper. As &s;he concealed it in her robe, &s;he &s;carcely dared to enquire by a ha&s;ty glance whether &s;he had been ob|&s;erved, and would have withdrawn immediately to ex|amine the contents, had &s;he not perceived, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, the Abbe&s;s quitting the apartment. On look|ing round for the nun, Ellena di&s;covered that &s;he was gone.</P>
<P>Ellena followed di&s;tantly in the Abbe&s;s's train; and, as &s;he drew nearer to Olivia, gave a &s;ignal, and pa&s;&s;ed on to her cell. There, once more alone, and having &s;ecured the door, &s;he &s;at down to read Vivaldi's billet, trying to command her impatience, and to under&s;tand the lines, over which her &s;ight rapidly moved, when, in the eagerne&s;s of turning over the paper, the lamp dropt from her trembling hand and expired. Her di&s;|tre&s;s now nearly reached de&s;pair. To go forth into the convent for a light was utterly impracticable, &s;ince it would betray that &s;he was no longer a pri&s;oner, and not only would Olivia &s;uffer from a di&s;covery of the indulgence &s;he had granted, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;he her&s;elf would be immediately confined. Her only hope re&s;ted upon Olivia's arrival before it might be too late to practi&s;e the in&s;tructions of Vivaldi, if, indeed they were &s;till practicable; and &s;he li&s;tened with inten&s;e &s;olicitude for an approaching foot&s;tep, while &s;he yet h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ld, igno|rant of its contents, the billet, that probably would decide her fate. A thou&s;and times &s;he turned about the eventful paper, and endeavoured to trace the lines with her &s;inger, and to gue&s;s their import, thus enve|loped in my&s;tery; while &s;he experienced all the vari|ous torture that the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having in her hand the information, on a timely knowledge of which her life, perhaps, depended, without being able to un|der&s;tand it, could inf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ict.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="032735_0187_0FF494A4B7D29A88">
Pre&s;ently &s;he heard advancing &s;teps, and a light gleamed from the pa&s;&s;age before &s;he con&s;idered they might be &s;ome other than Olivia's; and that it was pru|dent to conceal the billet &s;he held. The con&s;ideration, however, came too late to be acted upon; for before the ru&s;tling paper was di&s;po&s;ed of, a per&s;on entered the cell, and Ellena beheld her friend. Pale, trembling, and &s;ilent, &s;he took the lamp from the nun, and eager|ly running over Vivaldi's note, learned that at the time it was written, brother Jeronimo was in waiting without the gate of the nun's garden, where Vivaldi de&s;igned to join him immediately, and conduct her by a private way beyond the walls. He added, that hor&s;es were &s;tationed at the foot of the mountain, to convey her wherever &s;he &s;hould judge proper; and conjured her to be expeditious, &s;ince other circum&s;tances, be|&s;ides the univer&s;al engagement of the Reclu&s;es, were at that moment particularly favorable to an e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Ellena, de&s;ponding and appalled, gave the paper to Olivia, reque&s;ting &s;he would read it ha&s;tily, and advi&s;e her how to act. It was now an hour and a half &s;ince Vivaldi had &s;aid, that &s;ucce&s;s depended upon expedi|tion, and that he had probably watched at the appoint|ed place; in &s;uch an interval, how many circum&s;tances might have occurred to de&s;troy every po&s;&s;ibility of a retreat, which it was certain the engagement of the Abbe&s;s and the &s;i&s;ters no longer favoured.</P>
<P>The generous Olivia, having read the billet, par|took of all her young friend's di&s;tre&s;s, and was as willing, as Ellena was anxious, to dare every danger for the chance of obtaining deliverance.</P>
<P>Ellena could feel gratitude for &s;uch goodne&s;s even at this moment of agonizing apprehen&s;ion. After a pau&s;e of deep con&s;ideration, Olivia &s;aid, "in every a|venue of the convent we are now liable to meet &s;ome of the nuns; but my veil, though thin, has hitherto protected you, and we mu&s;t hope it may &s;till a&s;&s;i&s;t
<PB N="190" REF="032735_0188_0FF4705FD6516CB8">
your purpo&s;e. It will be nece&s;&s;ary, however, to pa&s;s through the refectory, where &s;uch of the &s;i&s;ters as did not partake of the colation, are a&s;&s;embled at &s;upper, and will remain &s;o till the fir&s;t mattin calls them to the chapel. If we wait till then, I fear it will be to no purpo&s;e to go at all."</P>
<P>Ellena's fears perfectly agreed with tho&s;e of Oli|via; and entreating that another moment might not be lo&s;t in he&s;itation, and that &s;he would lead the way to the nun's garden, they quitted the cell together.</P>
<P>Several of the &s;i&s;ters pa&s;&s;ed them, as they de&s;cend|ed to the refectory, but without particularly noticing Ellena; who, as &s;he drew near that alarming apartment, wrapt her viel clo&s;er, and leaned with heavier pre&s;&s;ure upon the arm of her faithful friend. At the door they were met by the Abbe&s;s, who had been overlooking the nuns a&s;&s;embled at &s;upper, and mi&s;&s;ing Olivia had enqui|red for her. Ellena &s;hrunk back to allude ob&s;ervation and to let the Superior pa&s;s; but Olivia was obliged to an&s;wer to the &s;ummons, Having, however, unvei|led her&s;elf, &s;he was permitted to proceed; and Ellena, who had mingled with the crowd that &s;urrounded the Abbe&s;s, and thus e&s;caped detection, followed Olivia with faltering &s;teps, through the refectory. The nuns were luckily too much engaged by the entertainment at this moment, to look round them, and the fugitive reached, un&s;u&s;pected, an oppo&s;ite door.</P>
<P>In the hall, to which they de&s;cended, the adventurers were frequently cro&s;&s;ed by &s;ervants bearing di&s;hes from the refectory to the kitchen; and, at the very moment when they were oppening the door, that led into the garden, a &s;i&s;ter, who had ob&s;erved them, de|manded whether thy had yet heard the mattin-bell, &s;ince they were going towards the chapel.</P>
<P>Terrified at this critical interruption, Ellena pre&s;|&s;ed Olivia's arm, in &s;ignal of &s;ilence, and was ha&s;ten|ing forward, when the latter, more prudent, pau&s;ed,
<PB N="191" REF="032735_0189_0FF46EAE3201D970">
and calmly an&s;wering the que&s;tion, was then &s;uffered to proceed.</P>
<P>As they cro&s;&s;ed the garden towards the gate, Elle|na's anxiety le&s;t Vivaldi &s;hould have been compelled to leave it, encrea&s;ed &s;o much, that &s;he had &s;carcely power to proceed. "O if my &s;trength &s;hould fail before I reach it!" &s;he &s;aid &s;oftly to Olivia, "or if I &s;hould reach it too late!"</P>
<P>Olivia tried to cheer her, and pointed out the gate, on which the moonlight fell; "At the end of this walk only," &s;aid Olivia, "&s;ee!&mdash;where the &s;hadows of the trees open, is our goal."</P>
<P>Encouraged by the view of it, Ellena fled with lighter &s;teps along the alley; but the gate &s;eemed to mock her approach, and to retreat before her. Fa|tigue overtook her in this long alley, before &s;he could overtake the &s;pot &s;o anxiou&s;ly &s;ought, and, breathle&s;s and exhau&s;ted, &s;he was once more compelled to &s;top, and once more in the agony of terror exclaimed&mdash;"O, if my &s;trength &s;hould fail before I reach it!&mdash;O, if I &s;hould drop even while it is in my view."</P>
<P>The pau&s;e of a moment enabled her to proceed, and &s;he &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">pped not again till &s;he arrived at the gate; when Olivia &s;ugge&s;ted the prudence of a&s;certaining who was without, and of receiving an an&s;wer to the &s;ignal, which Vivaldi had propo&s;ed, before they ven|tured to make them&s;elves known. She then &s;truck upon the wood, and, in the anxious pau&s;e that followed whi&s;pering voices were di&s;tinctly heard from without, but no &s;ignal &s;poke in reply to the nun's.</P>
<P>"We are betrayed!" &s;aid Ellena &s;oftly, "but I will know the wor&s;t at once;" and &s;he repeated the &s;ignal, when to her un&s;peakable joy, it was an&s;wered by three &s;mart raps upon the gate. Olivia, more di&s;|tru&s;tful, would have checked the &s;udden hope of her friend, till &s;ome farther proof <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad appeared that it was Vivaldi who waited without, but her precaution came
<PB N="192" REF="032735_0190_0FF47062566FDDB0">
too late; a key already grated in the lock; the door opened, and two per&s;ons muffled in their garments ap|peared at it. Ellena was ha&s;tily retreating, when a well known voice recalled her, and &s;he perceived, by the rays of a half-hooded lamp, which Jeronimo held, Vi|valdi.</P>
<P>"O heaven!" he exclaimed, in a voice tremu|lous with joy, as he took her hand, "is it po&s;&s;ible that you are again my own! If you could but know what I have &s;uffered during this la&s;t hour?"&mdash;Then ob|&s;erving Olivia, he drew back till Ellena expre&s;&s;ed her deep &s;en&s;e of obligation to the nun.</P>
<P>"We have no time to loo&s;e," &s;aid Jeronimo &s;ul|lenly; "we have &s;tayed too long alr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">dy, as you will find, perhaps."</P>
<P>"Farewel, dear, Ellena!" &s;aid Olivia, "may the protection of heaven never leave you!"</P>
<P>The fears of Ellena now gave way to affectionate &s;or|row, as weeping on the bo&s;om of the nun; &s;he &s;aid "farewel; O farewel, my dear, my tender friend! I mu&s;t never, never &s;ee you more, but I &s;hall always love you; and you have promi&s;ed, that I &s;hall hear from you; remember the convent della Pieta!"</P>
<P>"You &s;hould have &s;ettled this matter within," &s;aid Jeronimo, "we have been here the&s;e two hours al|ready."</P>
<P>"Ah Ellena!" &s;aid Vivaldi, as he gently di&s;engag|ed her from the nun, "do I then hold only the &s;econd place in your heart?"</P>
<P>Ellena, as &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her tears, replied with a &s;mile more eloquent than words; and when &s;he had again and again bade adieu to Olivia, &s;he gave him her hand, and quitted the gate.</P>
<P>"It is moonlight," ob&s;erved Vivaldi to Jeronimo, "your lamp is u&s;ele&s;s, and may betray us."</P>
<P>"It will be nece&s;&s;ary in the church," replied Jero|nimo, "and in &s;ome circuitous avenues we mu&s;t pa&s;s,
<PB N="193" REF="032735_0191_0FF494A7C6FC5098">
for I dare not lead you out through the great gates, Signor, as you well know."</P>
<P>"Lead on, then," replied Vivaldi, and they reach|ed one of the cypre&s;s walks, that extended to the church; but, before they entered it, Ellena pau&s;ed and looked back to the garden gate, that &s;he might &s;ee Olivia once more again. The nun was &s;till there, and Ellena perceived her faintly in the moonlight, waving her hand in &s;ignal of a la&s;t adieu. Ellena's heart was full; &s;he wept, and lingered, and returned the &s;ignal, till the gentle violence of Vivaldi withdrew her from the &s;pot.</P>
<P>"I envy your friend tho&s;e tears," &s;aid he "and feel jealous of the tenderne&s;s that excites them. Weep no more, my Ellena."</P>
<P>"If you knew her worth," replied Ellena, "and the obligation I owe her!"&mdash;Her voice was lo&s;t in &s;ighs, and Vivaldi only pre&s;&s;ed her hand in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>As they traver&s;ed the gloomy walk, that led to the church, Vivaldi &s;aid, "Are you certain, father, that not any of the brothers are doing penance at the &s;hrines in our way."</P>
<P>"Doing penance on a fe&s;tival, Signor! they are more likely, by this time, to be taking down the orna|ments."</P>
<P>"That would be equally unfortunate for us," &s;aid Vivaldi; "cannot we avoid the church, father?"</P>
<P>Jeronimo a&s;&s;ured him, that this was impo&s;&s;ible; and they immediately entered one of its lonely ai&s;les, where he unhooded the lamp, for the tapers, which had giv|en &s;plendor, at an earlier hour, to the numerous &s;hrines, had expired, except tho&s;e at the high altar, which were &s;o remote, that their rays faded into twi|light long before they reached the part of the church where the fugitives pa&s;&s;ed. Here and there indeed, a dying lamp &s;hot a tremulous gleam upon the &s;hrine below, and vani&s;hed again, &s;erving to mark the di&s;|tances
<PB N="194" REF="032735_0192_0FF47064108E6358">
in the long per&s;pective of arches, rather than to enlighten the gloomy &s;olitude; but no &s;ound, not even of a whi&s;per, &s;tole along the pavement.</P>
<P>They cro&s;&s;ed to a door communicating with the court, and with the rock, which en&s;hrined the image of <HI>our Lady of mount Carmel.</HI> There the &s;udden glare of tapers i&s;&s;uing from the cave, alarmed the fugitives, who had begun to retreat, when Jeronimo, &s;tepping forward to examine the place, a&s;&s;ured them, there was no &s;ymptom of any per&s;on being within, and that lights burned day and night around the &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine.</P>
<P>Revived by this explanation, they followed into the cave, where their conductor opened a part of the wire|work enclo&s;ing the &s;aint, and led them to the extrem|ity of the vault, &s;unk deep within which appeared a &s;mall door. While Ellena trembled with apprehen|&s;ion, Jeronimo applied a key, and they perceived, be|yond the door, a narrow pa&s;&s;age winding away into the rock. The monk was leading on, but Vivaldi, who had the &s;u&s;picions of Ellena, pau&s;ed at the en|trance, and demanded whither he was conducting them.</P>
<P>"To the place of your <HI>de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ation,"</HI> replied the brother, in a hollow voice; an an&s;wer which alarmed Ellena, and did not &s;atisfy Vivaldi. "I have given my&s;elf to your guidance," he &s;aid, "and have confided to you what is dearer to me than exi&s;tence. Your life," pointing to the &s;hort &s;word concealed beneath his pilg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">im's ve&s;t, "your life, you may rely upon my word, &s;hall an&s;wer for your treachery. If your pur|po&s;e is evil, pau&s;e a moment, and repent, or you &s;hall not quit this pa&s;&s;age alive."</P>
<P>"Do you menace me!" replied the brother, his countenance darkening. "Of what &s;ervice would be my death to you? Do you not know that every bro|ther in the convent would ri&s;e to avenge i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">?"</P>
<P>"I know only that I will make &s;ure of one traitor,
<PB N="195" REF="032735_0193_0FF494B157BCFB08">
if there be one," &s;aid Vivaldi, "and defend this lady again&s;t your ho&s;t of monks; and, &s;ince you al&s;o know this, proceed accordingly."</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant it occuring to Ellena, that the pa&s;|&s;age in que&s;tion probably led to the pri&s;on chamber, which Olivia had de&s;cribed as &s;ituated within &s;ome deep rece&s;s of the convent, and that Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">onimo had cer|tainly betrayed them, &s;he refu&s;ed to go further. "If your purpo&s;e is hone&s;t," &s;aid &s;he, "why do you not conduct us through &s;ome direct gate of the convent? why are we brought into the&s;e &s;ubterraneous laby|rinths?"</P>
<P>"There is no direct gate but that of the portal," Jeronimo replied, "and this is the only other avenue leading beyond the walls." "And why can we not go out through the portal?" Vivaldi a&s;ked.</P>
<P>"Becu&s;e it is be&s;et with pilgrims, and lay brothers," replied Jeronimo. "And though you might pa&s;s them &s;afely enough, what is to become of the lady? But all this you knew before, and was willing enough to tru&s;t me, then. The pa&s;&s;age we are entering opens upon the cliffs, at &s;ome di&s;tance. I have run hazard enough already, and will wa&s;te no more time; for if you do not chu&s;e to go forward, I will leave you, and you may act as you plea&s;e."</P>
<P>He concluded with a laugh of deri&s;ion, and was re|locking the door, when Vivaldi, alarmed for the pro|bable con&s;equence of his re&s;entment, and &s;omewhat re|a&s;&s;ured by the indifference he di&s;covered as to their pur&s;uing the avenue or not, endeavoured to appea&s;e him, as well as to encourage Ellena; and he &s;ucceeded in both.</P>
<P>As he fellowed in &s;ilence through the gloomy pa&s;|&s;age, his doubts were, however, not &s;o wholly van|qui&s;hed, but that he was prepared for attack, and while he &s;upported Ellena with one hand, he held his &s;word in the other.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="032735_0194_0FF47065C8849A60">
The avenue was of con&s;iderable length, and before they reached its extremity, they heard mu&s;ic from a di&s;tance, winding along the rocks.&mdash;"Hark!" cried Ellena, "Whence come tho&s;e &s;ounds? Li&s;ten!"</P>
<P>"From the cave we have left," replied Jeronimo, "and it is midnight by that; it is the la&s;t chaunt of the pilgrims at the &s;hrine of our Lady. Make ha&s;te, Signor, I &s;hall be called for."</P>
<P>The fugitives now perceived, that all retreat was cut off, and that, if they had lingered only a few mo|ments longer in the cave, they &s;hould have been &s;ur|pri&s;ed by tho&s;e devotees, &s;ome one of whom, however, it appeared po&s;&s;ible might wander into this avenue, and &s;till interrupt their e&s;cape. When Vivaldi told his apprehen&s;ions, Jeromino, with an arch &s;neer, af|firmed there was no danger of that, "for the pa&s;|&s;age," he added, "is known only to the brothers of the convent."</P>
<P>Vivaldi's doubts vani&s;hed when he further under|&s;tood, that the avenue led only from the cliffs without to the cave, and was u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of conveying &s;ecretly to the &s;hrine, &s;uch articles as were judged nece&s;&s;ary to excite the &s;uper&s;titious wonder of the devotees.</P>
<P>While he proceeded in thoughtful &s;ilence, a di&s;tant chime &s;ounded hollowly through the chambers of the rock. "The mattin-bell &s;trikes!" &s;aid Jeronimo, in &s;eeming alarm, "I am &s;ummoned. Signora, quicken your &s;teps;" an unnece&s;&s;ary reque&s;t, for Ellena al|ready pa&s;&s;ed with her utmo&s;t &s;peed; and &s;he now re|joiced on perceiving a door in the remote winding of the pa&s;&s;age, which &s;he believed would emancipate her from the convent. But, as &s;he advanced, the avenue appeared extended beyond it; and the door, which &s;tood a little open allowed her a glimp&s;e of a chamber in the cliff, du&s;kily lighted.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, alarmed by the light, enquired, when he
<PB N="197" REF="032735_0195_0FF494B2DEC2D8F0">
had pa&s;&s;ed, whether any per&s;on was in the chamber, and received an equivocal an&s;wer from Jeronimo, who, however, &s;oon after pointed to an arched gate that terminated the avenue. They proceeded with lighter &s;teps, for hope now cheared their hearts, and, on reaching the gate, all apprehen&s;ion vani&s;hed. Jero|nimo gave the lamp to Vivaldi, while he began to un|bar and unlock the door, and Vivaldi had prepared to reward the brother for his fidelity, before they per|ceived that the door refu&s;ed to yield. A dreadful agitation &s;eized on Vivaldi. Jeronimo turning round, coolly &s;aid, "I fear we are betrayed; the &s;e|cond lock is &s;hot! I have only the key of the fir&s;t."</P>
<P>"We are betrayed," &s;aid Vivaldi, in a re&s;olute tone, "but do not &s;uppo&s;e that your di&s;&s;imulation conceals you. I under&s;tand by whom we are betrayed. Re|collect my late a&s;&s;ertion, and con&s;ider once more, whether it is your intere&s;t to intercept us."</P>
<P>"My Signor," replied Jeronimo, "I do not de|ceive you when I prote&s;t by our holy Saint, that I have not cau&s;ed this gate to be fa&s;tened, and that I would open it if I could. The lock, which holds it, was not &s;hot an hour ago. I am the more &s;urpri&s;ed at what has happened, becau&s;e this place is &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed, even by the holie&s;t foot&s;tep; and I fear, whoever has pa&s;&s;ed now, has been led hither by &s;u&s;picion, and comes to intercept your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light."</P>
<P>"Your wily explanation, brother, may &s;erve you for an inferior occa&s;ion, but not on this," replied Vi|valdi, "either, therefore, unclo&s;e the gate, or prepare for the wor&s;t. You are not now to learn, that, how|ever &s;lightly I may e&s;timate my own life, I will never abandon this lady to the horrors which your commu|nity have already prepared for her."</P>
<P>Ellena, &s;ummoning her fleeting &s;pirits, endeavour|ed to calm the indignation of Vivaldi, and to prevent the con&s;equence of his &s;u&s;picions, as well as to prevail
<PB N="198" REF="032735_0196_0FF4706993634D78">
with Jeronimo to unfa&s;ten the gate. Her efforts were, however, followed by a long altercation; but, at length, the art or the innocence of the brother, ap|pea&s;ed Vivaldi, who now endeavoured to force the gate, while Jeronimo in vain repre&s;ented its &s;trength, and the certain ruin that mu&s;t fall upon him&s;elf, if it &s;hould be di&s;covered he had concurred in de&s;troy|ing it.</P>
<P>The gate was immoveable; but, as no other chance of e&s;caping appeared, Vivaldi was not ea&s;ily prevailed with to de&s;i&s;t; all po&s;&s;ibility of retreating too was gone, &s;ince the church and the cave were now crowd|ed with devotees, attending the mattin &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Jeronimo, however, &s;eemingly did not de&s;pair of effecting their relea&s;e, but he acknowledged that they would probably be compelled to remain concealed in this gloomy avenue all night, and perhaps the next day. At length, it was agreed, that he &s;hould return to the church, to examine whether a po&s;&s;ibility remained of the fugitives pa&s;&s;ing unob&s;erved to the great portal; and, having conducted them back to the chamber, of which they had taken a pa&s;&s;ing glimp&s;e, he proceeded to the &s;hrine.</P>
<P>For a con&s;iderable time after his departure, they were not without hope; but, their confidence dimi|ni&s;hing as his delay encrea&s;ed, their uncertainty at length became terrible; and it was only for the &s;ake of Vivaldi, from whom &s;he &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rupulou&s;ly concealed all knowledge of the particular fate, which &s;he was aware mu&s;t await her in the convent, that Ellena appeared to endure it with calmne&s;s. Notwith&s;tanding the plau&s;ibility of Jeronimo, &s;u&s;picion of his treachery re|turned upon her mind. The cold and earthy air of this chamber was like that of a &s;epulchre; and when &s;he looked round, it appeared exactly to corre&s;pond with the de&s;cription given by Olivia of the pri&s;on where the nun had langui&s;hed and expired. It was
<PB N="199" REF="032735_0197_0FF494B4667A0D48">
walled and valuted with the rock, had only one &s;mall grated aperture in the roof to admit air, and contained no furniture, except one table, a bench, and the lamp, which dimly &s;hewed the apartment. That a lamp &s;hould be found burning in a place &s;o remote and &s;oli|tary, amazed her &s;till more when &s;he recollected the a&s;&s;ertion of Jeronimo,&mdash;that even holy &s;teps &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed this way; and when &s;he con&s;idered al&s;o, that he had expre&s;&s;ed no &s;urpri&s;e at a circum&s;tance, accord|ing to his own a&s;&s;ertion, &s;o unu&s;ual. Again it ap|peared, that &s;he had been, betrayed into the very pri|&s;on, de&s;igned for her by the Abbe&s;s; and the horror, occa&s;ioned by this &s;uppo&s;ition was &s;o great, that &s;he was on the point of di&s;clo&s;ing it to Vivaldi, but an apprehen&s;ion of the di&s;traction, into which his de&s;pe|rate courage might precipitate him, re&s;trained her.</P>
<P>While the&s;e con&s;iderations occupied Ellena, and it appeared that any certainty would be le&s;s painful than this &s;u&s;pen&s;e, &s;he frequently looked round the chamber in &s;earch of &s;ome object, which might contradict or confirm her &s;u&s;picion, that this was the death-room of the unfortunate nun. No &s;uch circum&s;tance appear|ed, but as her eyes glanced, with almo&s;t phrenzied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">agerne&s;s, &s;he perceived &s;omething &s;hadowy in a re|mote corner of the floor; and on approaching, di&s;|covered what &s;eemed a dreadful hieroglyphic, a mat|tra&s;s of &s;traw, in which &s;he thought &s;he beheld the death-bed of the mi&s;erable reclu&s;e; nay more, that the impre&s;&s;ion it &s;till retained, was that which her form had left there.</P>
<P>While Vivaldi was yet entreating her to explain the occa&s;ion of the horror &s;he betrayed, the attention of each was withdrawn by a hollow &s;igh, that ro&s;e near them, Ellena caught uncon&s;ciou&s;ly the arm of Vivaldi, and li&s;tened, agha&s;t, for a return of the &s;ound, but all remained &s;till.</P>
<P>"It &s;urely was not fancied!" &s;aid Vivaldi, after a long pau&s;e, "you heard it al&s;o?"</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="032735_0198_0FF495219BC0C068">
"I did!" replied Ellena.</P>
<P>"It was a &s;igh, was it not!" he added.</P>
<P>"O yes, &s;uch a &s;igh!"</P>
<P>"Some per&s;on is concealed near us," ob&s;erved Vi|valdi, looking round; but be not alarmed, Ellena, I have a &s;word."</P>
<P>"A &s;word! alas! you know not&mdash;But hark! there, again!"</P>
<P>"That was very near us!" &s;aid Vivaldi. "This lamp burns &s;o fickly!"&mdash;and he held it high, endea|vouring to penetrate the furthe&s;t gloom of the cham|ber. "Hah! who goes there?" he cried, and &s;tep|ped &s;uddenly forward; but no per&s;on appeared, and a &s;ilence as of the tomb, returned.</P>
<P>"If you are in &s;orrow, &s;peak!" Vivaldi, at length, &s;aid; "from fellow-&s;ufferers you will meet with &s;ym|pathy. If your de&s;igns are evils&mdash;tremble, for you &s;hall find I am de&s;perate."</P>
<P>Still no an&s;wer was returned, and he carried for|ward the lamp to the oppo&s;ite end of the chamber, where he perceived a &s;mall door in the rock. At the &s;ame in&s;tant he heard from within, a low tremulous &s;ound, as of a per&s;on in prayer, or in agony. He pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed again&s;t the door, which, to his &s;urpri&s;e, yielded immediately, and di&s;covered a figure kneeling before a crucific, with an attention &s;o wholly engaged, as not to ob&s;erve the pre&s;ence of a &s;tranger, till Vivaldi &s;poke. The per&s;on then ro&s;e from his knees, and turning, &s;hewed the &s;ilver temples and pale features of an aged monk. The mind and &s;orrowful character of the countenance, and the lambent lu&s;tre of his eyes, which &s;eemed &s;till to retain &s;omewhat of the &s;ire of genius, intere&s;ted Vivaldi, and encouraged Ellena, who had followed him.</P>
<P>An unaffected &s;urpri&s;e appeared in the air of the monk; but Vivaldi, notwith&s;tanding the intere&s;ting benignity of his countenance, feared to an&s;wer his en|quiries,
<PB N="201" REF="032735_0199_0FF495FF785C8EF0">
till the father hinted to him, that an explana|tion was nece&s;&s;ary, even to his own &s;afety. Encouraged by his manner, rather than intimidated by his hint, and perceiving that his &s;ituation was de&s;perate, Vival|di confided to the friar &s;ome partial knowledge of his embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>While he &s;poke, the father li&s;tened with deep at|tention, looked with compa&s;&s;ion alternately upon him and Ellena; and &s;ome harra&s;&s;ing objection &s;eemed to contend with the pity which urged him to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;trangers. He enquired how long Jeronimo had been ab&s;ent, and &s;hook his head &s;ignificantly when he learn|ed that the gate of the avenue was fa&s;tened by a double lock. "You are betrayed my children," &s;aid he, "you have tru&s;ted with the &s;implicity of youth, and the cun|ning of age has deceived you."</P>
<P>The terrible conviction affected Ellena to tears; and Vivaldi, &s;carcely able to command the indignation which a view of &s;uch treachery excited, was unable to offer her any con&s;olation.</P>
<P>"You, my daughter, I remember to have &s;een in the church this morning," ob&s;erved the friar; "I re|member too, that you prote&s;ted again&s;t the vows you were brought thither to &s;eal. Alas! my child were you aware of the con&s;equence of &s;uch a proceeding?"</P>
<P>"I had only a choice of evils," Ellena replied.</P>
<P>"Holy father," &s;aid Vivaldi, "I will not believe, that you are one of tho&s;e who either a&s;&s;i&s;ted in or ap|proved the per&s;ecution&punc; of innocence. If you were acquainted with the misfortunes of this lady, you would pity, and &s;ave her; but there is now no time for detail; and I can only conjure you, by every &s;acred con&s;ideration, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her to leave the convent! If there were lei&s;ure to inform you of the unju&s;tifiable means, which have been employed to bring her within the&s;e walls&mdash;if you knew that &s;he was taken, an or|phan, from her home at midnight&mdash;that armed ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ians

brought her hither&mdash;and at the command of &s;trangers&mdash;that &s;he has not a &s;ingle relation &s;urviving to a&s;&s;ert her right of independence, or reclaim her o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> her per|&s;ecutors&mdash;O, holy father, if you knew all this!"&mdash;Vivaldi was unable to proceed.</P>
<P>The friar again regarded Ellena with compa&s;&s;ion, but &s;till in thoughtful &s;ilence. "All this may be very true," at length he &s;aid, "but"&mdash;and he he&s;itated.</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand you, father," &s;aid Vivaldi&mdash;"you require proof; but how can proof be adduced here? You mu&s;t rely upon the honour of my word. And, if you are inclined to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, it mu&s;t be immediate|ly!&mdash;while you he&s;itate, we are lo&s;t. Even now I think I hear the foot&s;teps of Jeronimo."</P>
<P>He &s;tepped &s;oftly to the door of the chamber, but all was yet &s;till. The friar, too, li&s;tened, but he al&s;o de|liberated; while Ellena, with cla&s;ped hands and a look of eager &s;upplication and terror, awaited his deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>"No one is approaching," &s;aid Vivaldi, "it is not yet too late!&mdash;Good father!&mdash;If you would &s;erve us, di&s;patch."</P>
<P>"Poor innocent!" &s;aid the friar, half to him&s;elf, "in this chamber&mdash;in this fatal place!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"In this chamber!" exclaimed Ellena, anticipat|ing his meaning. "It was in this chamber, then, that a nun was &s;uffered to peri&s;h! and I, no doubt, am conducted hither to undergo a &s;imilar fate!"</P>
<P>"In this chamber!" re-echoed Vivaldi, in a voice of de&s;peration. "Holy father, if you are indeed di&s;|po&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t us, let us act this in&s;tant; the next, per|haps, may render your be&s;t intentions unavailing!"</P>
<P>The friar, who had regarded Ellena while &s;he men|tioned the nun, with the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, now with|drew his attention; a few tears fell on his cheek, but he ha&s;tily dried them, and &s;eemed &s;truggling to over|come &s;ome grief, that was deep in his heart.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="032735_0201_0FF494BFC1B9B238">
Vivaldi, finding that entreaty had no power to ha&s;ten his deci&s;ion, and expecting every moment to hear the approach of Jeronimo, paced the chamber in agonizing perturbation, now pau&s;ing at the door to li&s;ten, and then calling, though almo&s;t hopele&s;sly, upon the humanity of the friar. While Ellena, looking round the room in &s;huddering horror, repeatedly ex|claimed, "On this very &s;pot! in this very chamber! O what &s;ufferings have the&s;e walls witne&s;&s;ed! what are they yet to witne&s;s!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi now endeavoured to &s;oothe the &s;pirits of Ellena, and again urged the friar to embrace this cri|tical moment in &s;aving her; "O heaven!" &s;aid he, "if &s;he is now di&s;covered, her fate is certain!"</P>
<P>"I dare not &s;ay what that fate would be," inter|rupted the father, "or what my own, &s;hould I con&s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t you; but, though I am old, I have not quite forgotten to feel for others! They may oppre&s;s the few remaining years of my life, but the blooming days of youth &s;hould flouri&s;h; and they &s;hall flouri&s;h, my children, if my power can aid you. Follow me to the gate; we will &s;ee whether my key cannot unfa&s;ten all the locks that hold it."</P>
<P>Vivaldi and Ellena immediately followed the feeble &s;teps of the old man, who frequently &s;topped to li&s;ten whether Jeronimo, or any of the brothers, to whom the latter might have betrayed Ellena's &s;ituation, were approaching; but not an echo wandered along the lonely avenue, till they reached the gate, when di&s;tant foot&s;teps beat upon the ground.</P>
<P>"They are approaching, father!" whi&s;pered El|lena. "O, if the key &s;hould not open th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in|&s;tantly, we are lo&s;t! Har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, now I hear their voice&mdash;they call upon my name! Already they have di&s;cover|ed we have left the chamber."</P>
<P>While the friar, with trembling hands, applied the
<PB N="204" REF="032735_0202_0FF4952D77EEBDA8">
key, Vivaldi endeavoured at once to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and to encourage Ellena.</P>
<P>The locks gave way, and the gate opened at once upon the moonlight mountains. Ellena heard once more, with the joy of liberty, the midnight breeze pa&s;&s;ing among the pen&s;ile branches of the palms, that loftily over&s;hadowed a rude platform before the gate, and ru&s;tling with fainter &s;ound among the pendent &s;hrubs of the &s;urrounding cliffs.</P>
<P>"There is no lei&s;ure for thanks, my children," &s;aid the friar, ob&s;erving they were about to &s;peak, "I will fa&s;ten the gate, and endeavour to delay your pur&s;uers, that you may have time to e&s;cape. My ble&s;&s;ing go with you!"</P>
<P>Ellena and Vivaldi had &s;carcely a moment to bid him "farewel!" before he clo&s;ed the door, and Vi|valdi, taking her arm, was ha&s;tening towards the place where he had ordered Paulo to wait with the hor&s;es, when on turning an angle of the convent wall, they per|ceived a long train of pilgrims i&s;&s;uing forth from the portal, at a little di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Vivaldi drew back; yet dreading every moment, that he lingered near the mone&s;tery, to hear the voice of Jeronimo, or other per&s;ons, from the avenue, he was &s;ometimes inclined to proceed at any hazard. The only practicable path leading to the ba&s;e of the moun|tain, however, was now occupied by the&s;e devotees, and to mingle with them was little le&s;s than certain de&s;truction. A bright moonlight &s;hewed di&s;tincttly every figure, that moved in the &s;cene, and the fugi|tives kept within the &s;hadow of the walls, till, warned by an approaching foot&s;tep, they cro&s;&s;ed to the feet of the cliffs that ro&s;e beyond &s;ome palmy hillocks on the right, who&s;e du&s;ky rece&s;&s;es promi&s;ed a temporary &s;hel|ter. As they pa&s;&s;ed with &s;ilent &s;teps along the wind|ing rock, the tranquility of the land&s;cape below afforded
<PB N="205" REF="032735_0203_0FF494C149ACA388">
an affecting contra&s;t with the tumult and alarm of their minds.</P>
<P>Being now at &s;ome di&s;tance from the mona&s;tery, they re&s;ted under the &s;hade of the cliffs; till the pro|ce&s;&s;ion of devotees, which were traced de&s;cending a|mong the thickets and hollows of the mountain, &s;hould be &s;ufficiently remote. Often they looked back to the convent, expecting to &s;ee lights i&s;&s;ue from the ave|nue, or to the portal; and attended in mute anxiety for the &s;ullen murmurs of pur&s;uit; but none came on the breeze; nor did any gleaming lamp betray the &s;teps of a &s;py.</P>
<P>Relea&s;ed, at length, from immediate apprehen&s;ion, Ellena li&s;tened to the mattin-hymn of the pilgrims, as it came upon the &s;till air and a&s;cended towards the cloudle&s;s heavens. Not a &s;ound mingled with the holy &s;train, and even in the mea&s;ured pau&s;e of voices only the trembling of the foliage above was di&s;tingui&s;h|ed. The re&s;pon&s;es, as they &s;oftened away in di&s;tance, and &s;welled again on the wafting breeze, appeared like the mu&s;ic of &s;pirits, watching by night upon the &s;ummits of the mountains, and an&s;wering each other in cele&s;tial airs, as they walk their high boundary, and overlook the &s;leeping world.</P>
<P>"How often, Ellena, at this hour," &s;aid Vivaldi, "have I lingered round your dwelling con&s;oled by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being near you! Within tho&s;e walls, I have &s;aid, &s;he repo&s;es; they enclo&s;ed my world, all without is to me a de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">art. Now, I am in your pre&s;ence! O Ellena! now that you are once more re&s;tored to me, &s;uffer not the caprice of po&s;&s;ibili|ty again to &s;eparate us! Let me lead you to the fir&s;t altar that will confirm our vows.</P>
<P>Vivaldi forgot, in the anxiety of a &s;tronger intere&s;t, the delicate &s;ilence he had re&s;olved to impo&s;e upon him&s;elf, till Ellena &s;hould be in a place of &s;afety.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="032735_0204_0FF4952F046FAE60">
"This is not a moment," &s;he replied, with he&s;ita|tion, "for conver&s;ation; our &s;ituation is yet perilous, we tremble on the very brink of danger."</P>
<P>Vivaldi immediately ro&s;e; into what imminent danger," &s;aid he, "had my folly nearly precipitated you! We are lingering in this alarming neighbour|hood, when that feeble &s;train indicates the pilgrims to be &s;ufficiently remote to permit us to proceed!"</P>
<P>As he &s;poke, they de&s;cended cautiou&s;ly among the cliffs, often looking back to the convent, where, how|ever, no light appeared, except what the moon &s;hed over the &s;pires and tall windows of its cathedral. For a moment, Ellena fancied &s;he &s;aw a taper in her favo|rite turret, and a belief, that the nuns, perhaps the Abbe&s;s her&s;elf, were &s;earching for her there, renewed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er terror and her &s;peed. But the rays were only tho&s;e of the moon, &s;triking through oppo&s;ite ca&s;ements of the chamber; and the fugitives reached the ba&s;e of the mountain without further alarm, where Paulo ap|peared with hor&s;es. "Ah! Signor mio," &s;aid the &s;ervant, "I am glad to &s;ee you alive and merry; I began to fear, by the length of your &s;tay, that the monks had clapped you up to do penance for life. How glad I am to &s;ee you Mae&s;tro!"</P>
<P>"Not more &s;o than I am to &s;ee you, good Paulo. But where is the pilgrim's cloak I bade you provide?"</P>
<P>Paulo di&s;played it, and Vivaldi, having wrapt it round Ellena, and placed her on hor&s;eback, they took the road towards Naples, Ellena, de&s;igning to take refuge in the convent della Pieta. Vivaldi, however, apprehending that their enemies would &s;eek them on this road, propo&s;ed leaving it as &s;oon as practicable, and reaching the neighbourhood of villa Altieri by a circuitous way.</P>
<P>They &s;oon arrived at the tremendous pa&s;s, through which Ellena had approached the mona&s;tery, and who&s;e horrors were con&s;iderably heightened at this
<PB N="207" REF="032735_0205_0FF494C2D1CF7A90">
du&s;ky hour, for the moonlight fell only partially upon the deep barriers of the gorge, and frequently the pre|cipice, with the road on its brow, was entirely &s;hadow|ed by other cliffs and woody points that ro&s;e above it. But Paulo, who&s;e &s;pirits &s;eldom owned the influence of local &s;cenery, jogged merrily along, frequently con|gratulating him&s;elf and his ma&s;ter on their e&s;cape, and carolling bri&s;kly to the echoes of the rocks, till Vi|valdi, apprehen&s;ive for the con&s;equence of this loud gaiety de&s;ired him to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>"Ah Signor mio! I mu&s;t obey you," &s;aid he, "but my heart was never &s;o full in my life; and I would fain &s;ing, to unburden it of &s;ome of this joy. That &s;crape we got into in that dungeon there, at what's the name of the place? was bad enough, but it was no|thing to this, becau&s;e here I was left out of it; and you, Mae&s;tro, might have been murdered again and again, while I, thinking of nothing at all, was quietly airing my&s;elf on the mountain by moonlight.&mdash;But what is that yonder in the &s;ky, Signor? It looks for all the world like a bridge; only it is perched &s;o high, that nobody would think of building one in &s;uch an out of the way place, unle&s;s to cro&s;s from cloud to cloud, much le&s;s would take the trouble of clambering up after it, for the plea&s;ure of going over.</P>
<P>Vivaldi looked forward, and Ellena perceived the Alpine bridge, &s;he had formerly cro&s;&s;ed with &s;o much alarm, in the moonlight per&s;pective, airily &s;u&s;pended between tremendous cliffs, with the river far below, tumbling down the rocky cha&s;m. One of the &s;up|porting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ffs, with part of the bridge, was in deep &s;hade, but the other feathered with foliage, and the ri&s;ing &s;urges at its foot, were &s;trongly illumined; and many a thicket wet with the &s;pray &s;parkled in contra&s;t to the dark rock it overhung Beyond the arch, the longdrawn pro&s;pect faded into mi&s;ty light.</P>
<P>"Well, to be &s;ure! exclaimed Paulo, "to &s;ee what
<PB N="208" REF="032735_0206_0FF495308DCD43A0">
curio&s;ity will do! If there are not &s;ome people have found their way up to the bridge already."</P>
<P>Vivaldi now perceived figures upon the &s;lender arch, and, as their indi&s;tinct forms glided in the moon&s;hine, other emotions than tho&s;e of wonder di&s;turbed him, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e might be pilgrims going to the &s;hrine of our Lady, and who would give information of his route. No po&s;&s;ibility, however, appeared of avoiding them, for the precipices that ro&s;e immediately above, and fell below, forbade all excur&s;ion, and the road it&s;elf was &s;o narrow, as &s;carcely to admit of two hor&s;es pa&s;|&s;ing each other.</P>
<P>"They are all off the bridge now, and without having broken their necks, perhaps!" &s;aid Paulo, "where, I wonder, will they go next! Why &s;urely, Signor, this road does not lead to the bridge yonder; we are not going to pick our way in the air too? The roar of tho&s;e waters has made my head dizzy al|ready; and the rocks here are as dark as midnight, and &s;eem ready to tumble upon one; they are enough to make one de&s;pair to look at them; you need not have checked my mirth, Signor."</P>
<P>"I would fain check your loquacity," replied Vi|valdi. "Do, good Paulo, be &s;ilent and circum&s;pect; tho&s;e people may be near us, though we do not yet &s;ee them."</P>
<P>"The road does lead to the bridge then, Signor!" &s;aid Paulo dolorou&s;ly. "And &s;ee! there they are again; winding round that rock, and coming to|wards us."</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h! they are pilgrims," whi&s;pered Vivaldi, "we will linger under the &s;hade of the&s;e rocks while they pa&s;s. Remember Paulo, that a &s;ingle indi&s;creet wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d may be fatal; and that if they hail us, I alone am to an&s;wer."</P>
<P>"You are obeyed, Signor."</P>
<P>The fugitives drew up clo&s;e under the cliffs, and
<PB N="209" REF="032735_0207_0FF494C45790AB48">
proceeded &s;lowly, while the words of the devotees, as they advanced, became audible.</P>
<P>"It gives one &s;ome comfort, &s;aid Paulo, "to hear cheerful voices, in &s;uch a place as this. Ble&s;s their merry hearts! theirs &s;eems a pilgrimane of plea&s;ure; but they will be demure enough, I warrant, by and by. I wi&s;h I"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Paulo have you &s;o &s;oon forgot?" &s;aid Vivaldi &s;harply.</P>
<P>The devotees, on perceiving the travellers, became &s;uddenly &s;ilent; till he who appeared to be the Father Director, as they pa&s;&s;ed &s;aid "Hail! in the name of <HI>Our Lady of mount Carmel!</HI>" and they repeated the &s;alutation in chorus.</P>
<P>"Hail!" replied Vivaldi, "the fir&s;t ma&s;s is over," and he pa&s;&s;ed on.</P>
<P>"But if you make ha&s;te, you may come in for the &s;econd," &s;aid Paulo, jogging after.</P>
<P>"You have ju&s;t left the &s;hrine, then?" &s;aid one of the party, "and can tell us"&mdash;"Poor pilgrims, like your&s;elves," replied Paulo, "and can tell as little. Good morrow, fathers, yonder peeps the dawn!"</P>
<P>He came up with his ma&s;ter, who had hurried for|ward with Ellena, and who now &s;everely reproved his indi&s;cretion; while the voices of the Carmelites, &s;ing|ing the mattin-hymn, &s;unk away among the rocks, and the quietne&s;s of &s;olitude returned.</P>
<P>"Thank heaven! we are quit of this adventure," &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"And now we have only the bridge to get over," rejoined Paulo, "and, hope, we &s;hall all be &s;afe."</P>
<P>They were now at the entrance of it; as they pa&s;&s;|ed the trembling planks, and looked up the glen, a party of people appeared advancing on the road the fugitives had left, and a chorus of other voices than tho&s;e of the Carmelites, were heard mingling with the hollow &s;ound of the waters.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="032735_0208_0FF4953B4EF0B500">
Ellena, again alarmed, ha&s;tened forward, and Vival|di, though he endeavoured to appea&s;e her apprehen&s;ion of pur&s;uit, encouraged her &s;peed.</P>
<P>"The&s;e are nothing but more pilgrims, Signor," &s;aid Paulo, "or they would not &s;end &s;uch loud &s;houts before them; they mu&s;t needs think we can hear."</P>
<P>The travellers proceeded as fa&s;t as the broken road would permit; and were &s;oon beyond the reach of the voices; but as Paulo turned to look whether the par|ty was within &s;ight, he perceived two per&s;ons, wrapt in cloaks, advancing under the brow of the cliffs, and within a few paces of his hor&s;e's heels. Before he could give notice to his ma&s;ter, they were at his &s;ide.</P>
<P>"Are you returning from the &s;hrine of <HI>our Lady?</HI>" &s;aid one of them.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, &s;tartled by the voice, looked round, and demanded who a&s;ked the que&s;tion?</P>
<P>"A brother pilgrim," replied the man, "one who has toiled up th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e &s;teep rocks, till his limbs will &s;carcely bear him further. Would that you would take compa&s;&s;ion on him, and give him a ride."</P>
<P>However compa&s;&s;ionate Vivaldi might be to the &s;ufferings of others, this was not a moment when he could indulge his di&s;po&s;ition, without endangering the &s;afety of Ellena; and he even fancied that the &s;tranger &s;poke in a voice of di&s;&s;imulation. His &s;u&s;picions &s;trengthened when the traveller, not repul&s;ed by a re|fu&s;al, inquired the way he was going, and propo&s;ed to join his party: "For the&s;e mountains, they &s;ay, are infe&s;ted with banditti," he added, "and a large com|pany is le&s;s likely to be attacked than a &s;mall one."</P>
<P>"If you are &s;o very weary, my friend," &s;aid Vi|valdi, "how is it po&s;&s;ible you can keep pace with our hor&s;es? though I acknowledge you have done won|ders in overtaking them."</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="032735_0209_0FF494CE2A0BA430">
"The fear of the&s;e banditti," replied the &s;tranger, "urged us on."</P>
<P>"You have nothing to apprehend from robbers," &s;aid Vivaldi, "if you will only moderate your pace; for a large company of pilgrims are on the road, who will &s;oon overtake you."</P>
<P>He then put an end to the conver&s;ation, by clapping &s;purs to his hor&s;e, and the &s;trangers were &s;oon left far behind. The incon&s;i&s;tency of their complaints with their ability, and the whole of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> manner, were &s;e|rious &s;ubjects of alarm to the fugitives; but when they had lo&s;t &s;ight of them, they lo&s;t al&s;o their appre|hen&s;ions; and having, at length, emerged from the pa&s;s, they quitted the high road to Naples, and &s;truck into a &s;olitary one that led we&s;tward towards Aquila.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FROM the &s;ummit of a mountain, the morning light &s;hewed the travellers the di&s;tant lake of Celano, gleaming at the feet of other lofty mountains of the Appennine, far in the &s;outh. Thither Vivaldi judged it prudent to direct his cour&s;e, for the lake lay &s;o re|mote from the immediate way to Naples, and from the neighbourhood of San Stefano, that its banks pro|mi&s;ed a &s;ecure retreat. He con&s;idered, al&s;o, that among the convents &s;cattered along tho&s;e delightful banks, might ea&s;ily be found a prie&s;t, who would &s;olemnize their nuptials, &s;hould Ellena con&s;ent to an immediate marriage.</P>
<P>The travellers de&s;cended among the olive woods, and &s;oon after were directed by &s;ome pea&s;ants at work, into a road that leads from Aquila to the town of Celano, one of the very few roads which intrudes among the wild mountains, that on every &s;ide &s;eque&s;|ter the lake. As they approached the low grounds, the &s;cent of orange blo&s;&s;oms breathed upon the morn|ing air, and the &s;picy myrtle &s;ent forth all its fragrance from among the cliffs, which it thickly tufted. Bowers of lemon and orange &s;pread along the valley; and among the cabins of the pea&s;ants, who cultivated them, Vivaldi hoped to obtain repo&s;e and refre&s;hment for Ellena.</P>
<P>The cottages, however, at which Paulo enquired, were unoccupied, the owners being all gone forth to their labour: and the travellers, again a&s;cending,
<PB N="213" REF="032735_0211_0FF494CFB2AE03A8">
found them&s;elves &s;oon after among the mountains inhabited by flocks, where the &s;cent of the orange was exchanged for the aromatic perfume of the pa&s;turage.</P>
<P>"My Signor!" &s;aid Paulo, "is not that a &s;hep|herd's horn &s;ounding at a di&s;tance? If &s;o, the Signora may yet obtain &s;ome refre&s;hment."</P>
<P>While Vivaldi li&s;tened, a hautboy and a pa&s;toral drum were heard con&s;iderably nearer.</P>
<P>They followed the &s;ound over the turf, and came within view of a cabin, &s;heltered from the &s;un by a tuft of almond trees. It was a dairy-cabin belonging to &s;ome &s;hepherds, who at a &s;hort di&s;tance were watch|ing their flocks, and, &s;tretched beneath the &s;hade of che&s;nuts, were amu&s;ing them&s;elves by playing upon the&s;e rural in&s;truments; a &s;cene of Arcadian manners frequent at this day, upon the mountains of Abbruzzo. The &s;implicity of their appearance, ap|proaching to wildne&s;s, was tempered by a ho&s;pitable &s;pirit. A venerable man, the chief &s;hepherd, advanced to meet the &s;trangers: and, learning their wants, con|ducted them into his cool cabin, where cream, chee&s;e made of goat's milk, honey extracted from the delici|ous herbage of the mountains, and dried &s;igs, were quickly placed before them.</P>
<P>Ellena, overcome with fatigue of anxiety, rather than that of travelling, retired, when &s;he had taken breakfa&s;t, for an hour's repo&s;e, while Vivaldi re&s;ted on the bench before the cottage, and Paulo, keeping watch, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed his breakfa&s;t, together with the cir|cum&s;tances of the late alarm, under the &s;hade of the almond trees.</P>
<P>When Ellena again appeared, Vivaldi propo&s;ed that they &s;hould re&s;t here during the inten&s;e heat of the day; and, &s;ince he now con&s;idered her to be in a place of temporary &s;afety, he ventured to renew the &s;ubject neare&s;t his heart; to repre&s;ent the evils that
<PB N="214" REF="032735_0212_0FF4953E7139BAF8">
might overtake them, and to urge an immediate &s;o|lemnization of their marriage.</P>
<P>Thoughtful and dejected, Ellena attended for &s;ome time in &s;ilence to the arguments and pleadings of Vi|valdi. She &s;ecretly acknowledged the ju&s;tne&s;s of his repre&s;entations, but &s;he &s;hrunk, more than ever, from the indelicacy, the degradation of intruding her&s;elf into his family; a family, too, from whom &s;he had not only received proofs of &s;trong di&s;like, but had &s;uffered terrible inju&s;tice, and been menaced with &s;till &s;everer cruelty. The&s;e latter circum&s;tances, however, re|lea&s;ed her from all obligations of delicacy or genero&s;ity, &s;o far as concerned only the authors of her &s;uffering; and &s;he had now but to con&s;ider the happine&s;s of Vi|valdi and her&s;elf. Yet &s;he could not decide thus pre|cipitately on a &s;ubject, which &s;o &s;olemnly involved the fortune of her whole life; nor forbear reminding Vi|valdi, affectionately, gratefully, as &s;he loved him, of the circum&s;tances that with-held her deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Tell me your&s;elf," &s;aid &s;he, "whether I ought to give my hand, while your family&mdash;your mother"&mdash;She pau&s;ed, blu&s;hed, and bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>"Spare me the view of the&s;e tears," &s;aid Vivaldi, "and a recollection of the circum&s;tances, that excite them. O, let me not think of my mother, while I &s;ee you weep! Let me not remember, that her inju&s;tice and cruelty de&s;tined you to perpetual &s;orrow!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi's features became &s;lightly convul&s;ed while he &s;poke; he ro&s;e, paced the room with quick &s;teps, and then quitted it, and walked under the &s;hade of the trees in the front of the cabin.</P>
<P>In a few moments, however, he commanded his emotion and returned. Again he placed him&s;elf on the bench be&s;ide Ellena, and taking her hand, &s;aid &s;o|lemnly, and in a voice of extreme &s;en&s;ibility, "Ellena, you have long witne&s;&s;ed how dear you are to me; you cannot doubt my love; you have long &s;ince promi&s;ed
<PB N="215" REF="032735_0213_0FF494D3A2DE8768">
&mdash;&s;olemnly promi&s;ed, in the pre&s;ence of her who is now no more, but who&s;e &s;pirit may even at this mo|ment look down upon us,&mdash;of her, who bequeathed you to my tendere&s;t care, to be mine for ever. By the&s;e &s;acred truths, by the&s;e affecting recollections! I conjure you abandon me not to de&s;pair, nor in the energy of a ju&s;t re&s;entment, &s;acrifice the &s;on to the cruel and mi&s;taken policy of the mother! You, nor I, can conjecture the machinations, which may be &s;pread for us, when it &s;hall be known that you have left San Stefano. If we delay to exchange our vows, I know, and I feel&mdash;that you are lo&s;t to me for ever!"</P>
<P>Ellena was affected, and for &s;ome moments unable to reply. At length, drying her tears, &s;he &s;aid ten|derly, "Re&s;entment can have no influence on my con|duct towards you; I think I feel none towards the Marche&s;a&mdash;for &s;he is your mother. But pride, in|&s;ulted pride, has a right to dictate, and ought to be obeyed; and the time is now, perhaps, arrived when, if I would re&s;pect my&s;elf, I mu&s;t renounce you."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Renounce me!" interrupted Vivaldi, "renounce me! And is it, then, po&s;&s;ible you could renounce me?" he repeated, his eyes &s;till fixed upon her face with eagerne&s;s and con&s;ternation, "Tell me at once, Elle|na, is it po&s;&s;ible?"</P>
<P>"I fear it is not," &s;he replied.</P>
<P>"You fear! alas! if you <HI>fear,</HI> it is too po&s;&s;ible, and I have lo&s;t you already! Say, O! &s;ay but, that you <HI>hope</HI> it is not, and I, too, will hope again."</P>
<P>The angui&s;h, with which he uttered this, awaken|ed all her tenderne&s;s, and, forgetting the re&s;erve &s;he had impo&s;ed upon her&s;elf, and every half-formed re|&s;olution, &s;he &s;aid, with a &s;mile of ineffable &s;weetne&s;s, "I will neither fear nor hope in this in&s;tance; I will obey the dictates of gratitude, of affection, and <HI>believe</HI> that I never can renounce you, while you are un|changed."</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="032735_0214_0FF4953FF87A5BD8">
"Believe!" repeated Vivaldi, "only believe! And why that mention of gratitude; and why that unne|ce&s;&s;ary re&s;ervation? Yet even this a&s;&s;urance, feebly as it &s;u&s;tains my hopes, is extorted; you &s;ee my mi&s;|ery, and from pity, from <HI>gratitude,</HI> not affection, would a&s;&s;uage it. Be&s;ides, you will neither fear, nor hope! Ah, Ellena! did love ever yet exi&s;t without fear&mdash;and without hope? O! never, never! I fear and hope with &s;uch rapid tran&s;ition; every a&s;&s;urance, every look of yours gives &s;uch force either to the one, or to the other, that I &s;uffer uncea&s;ing anxiety. Why, too, that cold, that heart-breaking mention of gratitude? No Ellena! it is too certain that you do not love me!&mdash;My mother's cruelty has e&s;tranged your heart from me!</P>
<P>"How much you mi&s;take!" &s;aid Ellena. "You have already received &s;acred te&s;timonies of my regard; if you doubt their &s;incerity, pardon me, if I &s;o far re|&s;pect my&s;elf as to forbear entreating you will believe them."</P>
<P>"How calm, how indifferent, how circum&s;pect, how prudent!" exclaimed Vivaldi in tones of mournful reproach. "But I will not di&s;tre&s;s you; forgive me for renewing this &s;ubject at this time. It was my in|tention to be &s;ilent till you &s;hould have reached a place of more parmanent &s;ecurity than this; but how was it po&s;&s;ible, with &s;uch anxiety pre&s;&s;ing upon my heart, to per&s;evere in that de&s;ign! And what have I gained by departing from it?&mdash;increa&s;e of anxiety&mdash;of doubt&mdash;of fear!"</P>
<P>"Why will you per&s;i&s;t in &s;uch &s;elf-inflictions?" &s;aid Ellena. "I cannot endure that you &s;hould doubt my affection, even for a moment. And how can you &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible, that I ever can become in&s;en&s;ible of your's; that I can ever forget the imminent danger you have voluntarily incurred for my relea&s;e, or re|membering it, can cea&s;e to feel the warme&s;t gratitude?</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="032735_0215_0FF494DD9D9CBBF8">
"That is the very word which tortures me beyond all others!" &s;aid Vivaldi; "is it then, only a &s;en&s;e of obligation you own for me? O! rather &s;ay you hate me, than &s;uffer me to deceive my hopes with a&s;&s;urances of a &s;entiment &s;o cold, &s;o circum&s;cribed, &s;o dutiful as that of gratitude!"</P>
<P>"With me the word has a very different acception, replied Ellena &s;miling. "I under&s;tand it to imply all that is tender and generous in affection; and the &s;en&s;e of duty which you &s;ay it includes, is one of the &s;weete&s;t and mo&s;t &s;acred feelings of the human heart."</P>
<P>"Ah Ellena! I am too willing to be deceived, to examine your definition rigorou&s;ly; yet I believe it is your &s;mile, rather than the accuracy of your expla|nation, that per&s;uades me to a confidence in your af|fection; and I will tru&s;t, that the gratitude <HI>you</HI> feel is thus tender and comprehen&s;ive. But, I be&s;eech you name the word no more! Its &s;ound is like the touch of the Torpedo, I perceive my confidence chilled even while I li&s;ten to my own pronunciation of it."</P>
<P>The entrance of Paulo interrupted the conver&s;ati|on, who advancing with an air of my&s;tery, and alarm, &s;aid in a low voice,</P>
<P>"Signor! as I kept watch under the almond trees, who &s;hould I &s;ee mounting up the road from the val|ley yonder but the two bare-footed Carmelites, that overtook us in the pa&s;s of Chiari! I lo&s;t them again behind the woods, but I dare &s;ay they are coming this way, for the moment they &s;py out this dairy-hut, they will gue&s;s &s;omething good is to be had here; and the &s;hepherds would believe their flocks would all die if"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I &s;ee them at this moment emerging from the woods," &s;aid Vivaldi, "and now, they are leaving the road and cro&s;&s;ing this way. Where is our ho&s;t, Paulo!</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="032735_0216_0FF4954B076DF270">
"He is without, at a little di&s;tance, Signor. Shall I call him?"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Vivaldi, "or &s;tay; I will call him my&s;elf. Yet, if they &s;ee me"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Aye, Signor; or, for that matter, if they &s;ee me. But we cannot help our&s;elves now; for if we call the ho&s;t, we &s;hall betray our&s;elves, and, if we do not call him, he will betray us; &s;o they mu&s;t find us out, be it as it may."</P>
<P>"Peace! peace! let me think a moment," &s;aid Vi|valdi. While Vivaldi undertook to think, Paulo was peeping about for a hiding place, if occa&s;ion &s;hould require one.</P>
<P>"Call our ho&s;t immediately," &s;aid Vivaldi, "I mu&s;t &s;peak with him."</P>
<P>"He pa&s;&s;es the lattices at this in&s;tant," &s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P>Paulo obeyed, and the &s;hepherd entered the cabin.</P>
<P>"My good friend," &s;aid Vivaldi, "I mu&s;t entreat that you will not admit tho&s;e friars whom you &s;ee coming this way, nor &s;uffer them to know what g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ts you have. They have been very trouble&s;ome to us already on the road; I will reward you for any lo&s;s their &s;udden departure may occa&s;ion you."</P>
<P>"Nay for that matter, friend," &s;aid Paulo, "it is their vi&s;it only that can occa&s;ion you lo&s;s, begging the Signor's pardon; their departure never occa&s;ioned lo&s;s to any body. And to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell you the truth, for my ma&s;ter will not &s;peak out, we were obliged to look pretty &s;harply about us, while they bore us company, or we have rea&s;on to think our pockets would have been the lighter. They are de&s;igning people, friend, take my word for it; banditti perhaps, in di&s;gui&s;e. The dre&s;s of a Carmelite would &s;uit their purpo&s;e, at this time of the pilgrimage. So be pretty blunt with them, if they want to come in here; and you will do well, when they go, to &s;end &s;omebody to watch which way
<PB N="219" REF="032735_0217_0FF494DF25A41008">
they take, and &s;ee them clear off, or you may lo&s;e a &s;tray lamb perhaps."</P>
<P>The old &s;hepherd lifted up his eyes and hands, "to &s;ee how the world goes!" &s;aid he. "But thank you, Mae&s;tro, for your warning; they &s;hall not come within my thre&s;hold, for all their holy &s;eeming, and its the fir&s;t time in my life I ever &s;aid nay to one of their garb, and mine has been a pretty long one, as you may gue&s;s, perhaps, by my face. How old, Sig|nor, &s;hould you take me to be? I warrant you will gue&s;s &s;hort of the matter though; for one of the&s;e high mountains"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I will gue&s;s when you have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the travel|lers," &s;aid Vivaldi, "after having given them &s;ome ha&s;ty refre&s;hment without, they mu&s;t be almo&s;t at the door by this time. Di&s;patch, friend."</P>
<P>"If they &s;hould fall foul upon me, for refu&s;ing them entrance," &s;aid the &s;hepherd, "you will come out to help me, Signor? for my lads are at &s;ome di&s;tance."</P>
<P>Vivaldi a&s;&s;ured him that they would, and he left the cabin.</P>
<P>Paulo ventured to peep at the lattice, on what might be going forward without. "They are gone round to the door, Signor, I fancy," &s;aid he, "for I &s;ee no|thing of them this way; if there was but another window! What fooli&s;h people to build a cottage with no window near the door! But I mu&s;t li&s;ten."</P>
<P>He &s;tepped on tip-toe to the door, and bent his head in attention.</P>
<P>"They are certainly &s;pies from the mon&s;tery," &s;aid Ellena to Vivaldi, "they follow us &s;o clo&s;ely! If they were pilgrims, it is improbable, too, that their way &s;hould lie through this unfrequented region, and &s;till more &s;o, that they &s;hould not travel in a larger party. When my ab&s;ence was di&s;covered, the&s;e peo|ple were &s;ent, no doubt, in pur&s;uit of me, and having
<PB N="220" REF="032735_0218_0FF4954C8DC3DD60">
met the devotees whom we pa&s;&s;ed, they were enabled to follow our route."</P>
<P>"We &s;hall do well to act upon this &s;uppo&s;ition," replied Vivaldi, "but though I am inclined to believe them emi&s;&s;aries from San Stefano, it is not improba|ble that they are only Carmelites returning to &s;ome convent on the lake of Celano."</P>
<P>"I cannot hear a &s;yllable, Signor," &s;aid Paulo. "Pray do li&s;ten your&s;elf! and there is not a &s;ingle chink in this door to afford one con&s;olation. Well! if ever I build a cottage, there &s;hall be a window near&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Li&s;ten!" &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Not a &s;ingle word, Signor!" cried Paulo, after a pau&s;e, "I do not even hear a voice!&mdash;But now I hear &s;teps, and they are coming to the door, too; they &s;hall find it no ea&s;y matter to open it, though;" he added, placing him&s;elf again&s;t it. "Ay, ay, you may knock, friend, till your arm aches, and kick and lay about you&mdash;no matter for that."</P>
<P>"Silence! let us know who it is," &s;aid Vivaldi, and the old &s;hepherd's voice was heard without. "They are gone, Signor," &s;aid he, "you may open the door."</P>
<P>"Which way did they go," a&s;ked Vivaldi, when the man entered. "I cannot &s;ay, as to that, Signor, becau&s;e I did not happen to &s;ee them at all; and I have been looking all about, too."</P>
<P>"Why, I &s;aw them my&s;elf, cro&s;&s;ing this way from the wood yonder," &s;aid Paulo.</P>
<P>"And there is nothing to &s;helter them from our view between the wood and this cottage, friend," add|ed Vivaldi; "What can they have done with them|&s;elves?"</P>
<P>"For that matter, gone into the wood again, per|haps," &s;aid the &s;hepherd.</P>
<P>Paulo gave his ma&s;ter a &s;ignificant look, and added,
<PB N="221" REF="032735_0219_0FF494E0B04525B0">
"It is likely enough, friend; and you may depend upon it they are lurking there for no good purpo&s;e. You will do well to &s;end &s;omebody to look after them; your flocks will &s;uffer for it el&s;e. Depend upon it, they de&s;ign no good."</P>
<P>"We are not u&s;ed to &s;uch &s;ort of folks in the&s;e parts," replied the &s;hepherd, "but if they mean us any harm, they &s;hall find we can help our&s;elves. As he concluded he took down a horn from the roof, and blew a &s;hrill bla&s;t that made the mountains echo; when immediately the younger &s;hepherds were &s;een running from various quarters towards the cottage.</P>
<P>"Do not be alarmed friend," &s;aid Vivaldi, "the&s;e travellers mean you no harm, I dear &s;ay, whatever they may de&s;ign again&s;t us. But, as I think them &s;u&s;pi|cious per&s;ons, and &s;hould not like to overtake them on the road, I will reward one of your lads if you will let him go a little ways towards Celano, and examine whether they are lurking on that route."</P>
<P>The old man con&s;ented, and when the &s;hepherds came up, one of them received directions from Vi|valdi.</P>
<P>"And be &s;ure you do not return till you have found them," added Paulo.</P>
<P>"No, ma&s;ter," replied the lad, "and I will bring them &s;afe here you may tru&s;t me."</P>
<P>"If you do, friend, you will get your head broke for your trouble. You are only to di&s;cover where they are, and to watch where they go," &s;aid Paulo.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, at length, made the lad comprehend what was required of him, and he departed; while the old &s;hepherd went out to keep guard.</P>
<P>The time of his ab&s;ence was pa&s;&s;ed in various con|jectures by the party in the cabin, concerning the Carmelites. Vivaldi &s;till inclined to believe they were hone&s;t people returning from a pilgrimage, but Paulo was decidedly again&s;t this opinion. "They are
<PB N="222" REF="032735_0220_0FF4954E1DF56F00">
waiting for us on the road, you may depend upon it, Signor," &s;aid the latter. "You may be certain they have &s;ome great de&s;ign in hand, or they would never have turned their &s;teps from this dairy-hou&s;e when once they had &s;pied it, and that they did &s;py it, we are &s;ure."</P>
<P>"But if they have in hand the great de&s;ign you &s;peak of Paulo," &s;aid Vivaldi, "it is probable that they have &s;pied us al&s;o, by their taking this ob&s;ure road. Now it mu&s;t have occurred to them when they &s;aw a dairy-hut, in &s;o &s;olitary a region, that we might probably be found within&mdash;yet they have not examined. It appears, therefore, they have no de&s;ign again&s;t us. What can you an&s;wer to this, Paulo! I tru&s;t the apprehen&s;ions of Signora di Ro&s;alba are un|founded."</P>
<P>"Why! do you &s;uppo&s;e, Signor, they would attack us when we're &s;afe hou&s;ed, and had the&s;e good &s;hep|herds to lend us a helping hand? No, Signor, they would not even have &s;hewn them&s;elves if they could have helped it; and being once &s;ure we were here, they would &s;kulk back to the woods, and lurk for us in the road they knew we mu&s;t go, &s;ince, as it happens, there is only one."</P>
<P>"How is it po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid Ellena, "that they can have di&s;covered us here, &s;ince they did not approach the cabin to enquire?"</P>
<P>"They came near enough for their purpo&s;e, Sig|nora, I dare &s;ay; and, if the truth were known, they &s;pied my face looking at them through the lattice."</P>
<P>"Come, come," &s;aid Vivaldi, "you are an inge|nious tormentor, indeed, Paulo, Do you &s;uppo&s;e they &s;aw enough of thy face la&s;t night by moonlight, in that du&s;ky glen to enable them to recollect it again at a di&s;tance of forty yards? Revive, my Ellena, I think every appearance is in our favour."</P>
<P>"Would I could think &s;o too!" &s;aid &s;he with a &s;igh.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="032735_0221_0FF494E239009338">
"O! for that matter, Signora," rejoined Paulo, "there is nothing to be afraid of; they &s;hould find tough work of it, if they thought proper to attack us, lady."</P>
<P>"It is not an open attack that we have to fear," replied Ellena, "but they may &s;urround us with their &s;nares, and defy re&s;i&s;tance."</P>
<P>However Vivaldi might accede to the truth of this remark, he would not appear to do &s;o; but he tried to laugh away her apprehen&s;ions; and Paulo was &s;ilenced for a while by a &s;ignificant look from his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The &s;hepherd's boy returned much &s;ooner than they had expected, and he probably &s;aved his time that he might &s;pare his labour, for he brought no intelligence of the Carmelites. "I looked for them among the woods along the road &s;ide in the hollow, yonder," &s;aid the lad, "and then I mounted the hill further on, but I could &s;ee nothing of them far or near, nor of a &s;ingle &s;oul, except our goats, and &s;ome of them do &s;tray wide enough, &s;ometimes; they lead me a fine dance often. They &s;ometimes, Signor, have wandered as far as Monte Nuvola, yonder, and got to the top of it, up among the clouds, and the crags, where I &s;hould break my neck if I climbed; and the rogues &s;eemed to know it, too, for when they have &s;een me coming, &s;cramb|ling up, puffing and blowing, they have cea&s;ed their capering, and &s;tood peeping over a crag &s;o fly, and &s;o quiet, it &s;eemed as if they were laughing at me; as much as to &s;ay, "Catch us if you can."</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who during the latter part of this &s;peech had been con&s;ulting with Ellena, whether they &s;hould proceed on their way immediately, a&s;ked the boy &s;ome further que&s;tions concerning the Carmelites; and be|coming convinced that they had either not taken the road to Celano, or, having taken it, were at a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance, he propo&s;ed &s;etting out, and proceeding lei&s;urely; "For I have now little apprehen&s;ion of
<PB N="224" REF="032735_0222_0FF494D13808B230">
the&s;e people," he added, "and a great deal le&s;t night &s;hould overtake us before we reach the place of our de&s;tination, &s;ince the road is mountainous and wild, and, further, we are not perfectly acquainted with it."</P>
<P>Ellena approving the plan, they took leave of the good &s;hepherd, who could with difficulty be prevailed with to accept any recompence for his trouble, and who gave them &s;ome further directions as to the road; and their way was long cheered by the &s;ound of the tabor, and the &s;weetne&s;s of the hautboy, wafted over the wild.</P>
<P>When they de&s;cended into the woody hollow men|tioned by the boy, Ellena &s;ent forth many an anxious look beneath the deep &s;hade; while Paulo, &s;ometimes &s;ilent, and at others whi&s;tling and &s;inging loudly, as if to overcome his fears, peeped under every bough that cro&s;&s;ed the road, expecting to di&s;cover his friends the Carmelites lurking within its gloom.</P>
<P>Having emerged from this valley, the road lay over the mountains covered with flocks, for it was now the &s;ea&s;on when they had quitted the plains of Apulia, to feed upon the herbage for which this region is cele|brated; and it was near &s;un-&s;et, when, from a &s;ummit to which the travellers had long been a&s;cending, the whole lake of Celano, with its va&s;t circle of moun|tains, bur&s;t at once upon their view.</P>
<P>"Ah Signor!" exclaimed Paulo, "what a pro&s;pect is here! It reminds me of home; it is almo&s;t as plea&s;ant as the bay of Naples! I &s;hould never love it like that though, if it were an hundred times finer."</P>
<P>The travellers &s;topped to admire the &s;cene, and to give their hor&s;es re&s;t, after the labour of the a&s;cent. The evening &s;un, &s;hooting athwart a clear expan&s;e of water, between eighteen and twenty leagues in cir|cumference, lighted up all the town and villages, and towered ca&s;tles, and &s;piry convents, that enriched the ri&s;ing &s;hores; brought out all the various tints of cul|tivation,

and coloured with beamy purple the moun|tains which on every &s;ide formed the maje&s;tic back|ground of the land&s;cape. Vivaldi pointed out to El|lena the gigantic Velino in the north, a barrier moun|tain, between the territories of Rome and Naples. Its peaked head towered far above every neighbour|ing &s;ummit, and its white precipices were oppo&s;ed to the verdant points of the Majella, &s;now crowned, and next in altitude, loved by the flocks. We&s;tward near woody hills, and ri&s;ing immediately from the lake, ap|peared Monte Salviano, covered with wild &s;age, as its name imports, and once pompous with fore&s;ts of che&s;tnut; a branch from the Appennine extended to meet it. "See," &s;aid Vivaldi, "where Monte-Corno &s;tands like a ru&s;&s;ian, huge, &s;eared, threatening, and horrid!&mdash;and in the &s;outh, where the &s;ullen mountain of San Nicolo &s;hoots up, barren and rocky! From thence, mark how other overtopping ridges of the mighty Appennine darken the horizon far along the ea&s;t, and circle to approach the Velino in the north!"</P>
<P>"Mark too," &s;aid Ellena, "how &s;weetly the banks and undulating plains repo&s;e at the feet of the moun|tains; what an image of beauty and elegance they op|po&s;e to the awful grandeur that overlooks and guards them? Ob&s;erve, too, how many a delightful valley, opening from the lake, &s;preads its rice and corn fields, &s;haded with groves of the almond far among the wind|ing hills; how gaily vineyards and olives alternately chequer the acclivities, and how gracefully the lofty palms bend over the higher cliffs."</P>
<P>"Ay, Signora!" exclaimed Paulo, "and have the goodne&s;s to ob&s;erve how like are the fi&s;hing boats, that &s;ail towards the hamlet below, to tho&s;e one &s;ees upon the bay of Naples. They are worth all the re&s;t of the pro&s;pect, except indeed this fine &s;heet of water, which is almo&s;t as good as the bay, and that mountain, with its &s;harp head, which is almo&s;t as good as Vesu+vius&mdash;if it would but throw out fire!"</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="032735_0224_0FF4954FA69CFE98">
"We mu&s;t de&s;pair of finding a mountain in this neighbourhood, &s;o <HI>good</HI> as to do that, Paulo," &s;aid Vi|valdi, &s;miling at this &s;troke of nationalty; "though, perhaps, many that we now &s;ee, have been volcanic."</P>
<P>"I honor them for that Signor; and look at them with double &s;atisfaction; but <HI>our</HI> mountain is the only mountain in the world. O! to &s;ee it of a dark night! what a blazing it makes! and what a height it will &s;hoot to! and what a light it throws over the &s;ea! No other mountain can do &s;o. It &s;eems as if the waves were all on fire. I have &s;een the reflection as far as Capri, trembling all acro&s;s the gulf, and &s;hewing eve|ry ve&s;&s;el as plain as at noon day; ay, and every &s;ailor on the deck. You never &s;aw &s;uch a &s;ight, Signor."</P>
<P>"Why you do, indeed, &s;eem to have forgotten that I ever did, Paulo, and al&s;o that a volcano can do any mi&s;chief. But let us return, Ellena, to the &s;cene be|fore us. Yonder, a mile or two within the &s;hore, is the town of Celano, whither we are going."</P>
<P>The clearne&s;s of an Italian atmo&s;phere permitted him to di&s;criminate the minute through very di&s;tant features of the land&s;cape; and on an eminence ri&s;ing from the plains of a valley, opening to the we&s;t, he pointed out the modern Alba, crowned with the ruins of its ancient ca&s;tle &s;till vi&s;ible upon the &s;plendor of the horizon, the pri&s;on and the tomb of many a Prince, who, "fallen from his high e&s;tate," was &s;ent from Imperial Rome to fini&s;h here the &s;ad rever&s;e of his days; to gaze from the bars of his tower upon &s;o|litudes where beauty or grandeur admini&s;tered no a&s;|&s;uaging feeling to him, who&s;e life had pa&s;&s;ed amid&s;t the intrigues of the world and the feveri&s;h contentions of di&s;appointed ambition; to him, with whom reflec|tion brought only remor&s;e, and anticipation de|&s;pair; whom, no horizontal beam enlivened in the crim&s;on evening of life's du&s;ty day."</P>
<P>"And &s;uch a &s;cene as this," &s;aid Vivaldi, "a Ro|man

emperor came, only for the purpo&s;e of witne&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t barbarous exhibition; to indulge the mo&s;t &s;avage delights! Here, Claudius celebrated the ac|compli&s;hment of his arduous work, an aqueduct to carry the overflowing waters of the Celano to Rome, by a naval fight, in which hundreds of wretched &s;laves peri&s;hed for his amu&s;ement! Its pure and poli&s;hed &s;urface was &s;tained with human blood, and roughened by the plunging bodies of the &s;lain, while the gilded gallies of the Emperor floated gaily around, and the&s;e beautiful &s;hores were made to echo with applauding yells, worthy of the furies!"</P>
<P>"We &s;carcely dare to tru&s;t the truth of hi&s;tory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;ome of its traits of human nature," &s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P>"Signor," cried Paulo, "I have been thinking that while we are taking the air, &s;o much at our ea&s;e, here, tho&s;e Carmelites may be &s;pying at us from &s;ome hole or corner that we know nothing of, and may &s;woop upon us, all of a &s;udden, before we can help our&s;elves. Had we not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> go on, Signor?"</P>
<P>"Our hor&s;es are, perhaps, &s;ufficiently re&s;ted," re|plied Vivaldi, "but, if I had not long &s;ince di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all &s;u&s;picion of the evil intention of tho&s;e &s;trangers, I &s;hould not willingly have &s;topped for a moment."</P>
<P>"But pray let us proceed," &s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P>"Ay, Signora, it is be&s;t to be of the &s;afe &s;ide," ob|&s;erved Paulo. "Yonder, below, is Celano, and I hope we &s;hall get &s;afe hou&s;ed, there, before it is quite dark, for here we have no mountain, that will light us on our way! Ah! if we were within twenty miles of Naples now&mdash;and it was an illumination night!"&mdash;</P>
<P>As they de&s;cended the mountain, Ellena, &s;ilent and dejected, abandoned her&s;elf to reflection. She was too &s;en&s;ible of the difficulties of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and too apprehen&s;ive of the influence, which her de|termination mu&s;t have on all her future life, to be hap|py, though e&s;caped from the pri&s;on of San Ste&s;ano, and
<PB N="228" REF="032735_0226_0FF495605AB0CB50">
in the pre&s;ence of Vivaldi, her beloved deliverer and protector. He ob&s;erved her dejection with grief, and not under&s;tanding all the finer &s;cruples that di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her, interpreted her re&s;erve into indifference towards him&s;elf. But he forbore to di&s;turb her again with a mention of doubts, or fears; and he determined not to urge the &s;ubject of his late entreaties, till he &s;hould have placed her in &s;ome &s;ecure a&s;ylum, where &s;he might feel her&s;elf at perfect liberty to accept or reject his propo&s;al. By acting with an honor &s;o delicate, he uncon&s;ciou&s;ly adopted a certain means of encrea&s;ing her e&s;teem and gratitude, and de&s;erved them the more, &s;ince he had to endure the apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing her by the delay thus occa&s;ioned to their nuptials.</P>
<P>They reached the town of Celano before the even|ing clo&s;ed; when Vivaldi was reque&s;ted by Ellena to enquire for a convent, where &s;he might be lodged for the night. He left her at the inn, with Paulo for her guard, and proceeded on his &s;earch. The fir&s;t gate he knocked upon belonged to a convent of Car|melites. It appeared probable, that the pilgrims of that order, who had occa&s;ioned him &s;o much di&s;quie|tude, were hone&s;t brothers of this hou&s;e; but as it was probable al&s;o, that if they were emi&s;&s;aries of the Abbe&s;s of San Stefano, and came to Celano, they would take up their lodgings with a &s;ociety of their own cla&s;s, in preference to that of any other, Vivaldi thought it pru|dent to retire from their gates without making him|&s;elf known. He pa&s;&s;ed on, therefore, and &s;oon after arrived at a convent of Dominicans, where he learned, that there were only two hou&s;es of nuns in Celano, and that the&s;e admitted no other boarders than perma|nent ones.</P>
<P>Vivaldi returned with this intelligence to Ellena, who endeavoured to reconcil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> her&s;elf to the nece&s;&s;ity of remaining where &s;he was; but Poulo, ever active and zealous, brought intelligence, that at a little fi&s;h|ing
<PB N="229" REF="032735_0227_0FF494EF88A011A0">
town, at &s;ome di&s;tance, on the bank of the lake, was a convent of Ur&s;alines, remarkable for their ho&s;|pitality of &s;trangers. The ob&s;curity of &s;o remote a place, was another rea&s;on for prefering it to Celano, and Vivaldi propo&s;ing to remove thither, if Ellena was not too weary to proceed, &s;he readily a&s;&s;ented, and they immediately &s;et off.</P>
<P>"It happens to be a fine night," &s;aid Paulo, as they left Celano, "and &s;o, Signor, we cannot well lo&s;e our way; be&s;ides, they &s;ay, there is but one. The town we are going to lies yonder on the edge of the lake, about a mile and a half off. I think I can &s;ee a gray &s;teeple or two, a little to the right of that wood where the water gleams &s;o."</P>
<P>"No, Paulo," replied Vivaldi, after looking atten|tively. "I perceive what you mean; but tho&s;e are not the points of &s;teeples, they are only the tops of &s;ome tall cypre&s;&s;es."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, Signor, they are too tapering for trees; that mu&s;t &s;urely be the town. This road, however, will lead us right, for there is no other to puzzle us, as they &s;ay."</P>
<P>"This cool and balmy air revives me," &s;aid El|lena; "and what a &s;oothing &s;hade prevails over the &s;cene! How softened, yet how di&s;tinct, is every near object; how &s;weetly dubious are the more removed ones; while the mountains beyond character them|&s;elves &s;ublimely upon the &s;till glowing horizon."</P>
<P>"Ob&s;erve, too," &s;aid Vivaldi, "how their broken &s;ummits, tipt with the beams that have &s;et to our lower region, exhibit the portraiture of towers and ca&s;tles, and embattled ramparts, which &s;eemed de&s;ign|ed to guard them again&s;t the enemies, that may come by the clouds."</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Ellena, "the mountains them&s;elves di&s;play a &s;ublimity, that &s;eems to belong to a higher
<PB N="230" REF="032735_0228_0FF4955BB5FA8AE0">
world; their be&s;iegers ought not to be of this earth; they can be only &s;pirits of the air."</P>
<P>"They can be nothing el&s;e, Signora," &s;aid Paulo, "for nothing of this earth can reach them. See! lady, they have &s;ome of the qualities of your &s;pirits, too; &s;ee! how they change their &s;hapes and colours, as the &s;unbeams &s;ink. And now, how gray and dim they grow! See but how fa&s;t they vani&s;h?"</P>
<P>"Every thing repo&s;es," &s;aid Vivaldi. "Who would willingly travel in the day, when Italy has &s;uch nights as this!"</P>
<P>"Signor, that is the town before us," &s;aid Paulo, "for now I can di&s;cern, plain enough, the &s;pires of convents; and there goes a light! Hah! hah! and there is a bell, too, chiming from one of the &s;pires! The monks are going to ma&s;s; would we were going to &s;upper, Signor!"</P>
<P>"That chime is nearer than the place you point to, Paulo, and I doubt whether it comes from the &s;ame quarter."</P>
<P>"Hark! Signor, the air wafts the &s;ound! and now it is gone again."</P>
<P>"Yes, I believe you are right, Paulo, and that we have not far to go."</P>
<P>The travellers de&s;cended the gradual &s;lopes, towards the &s;hore; and Paulo, &s;ome time after, exclaimed, "See, Signor, where another light glides along! See! it is reflected on the lake."</P>
<P>"I hear the faint da&s;hing of waves, now," &s;aid El|lena, "and the &s;ound of oars, too. But ob&s;erve, Paulo, the light is not in the town, it is in the boat that moves yonder."</P>
<P>"Now it retreats, and trembles in a lengthening line upon the waters," &s;aid Vivaldi. "We have been too ready to believe what we wi&s;h, and have yet far to go"</P>
<P>The &s;hore they were approaching formed a &s;pacious
<PB N="231" REF="032735_0229_0FF494F10E1ACF30">
bay for the lake immediately below. Dark woods &s;eemed to &s;pread along the banks, and a&s;cend among the cultivated &s;lopes towards the mountains; except where, here and there, cliffs, bending over the water, were di&s;tingui&s;hed through the twilight by the white|ne&s;s of their lime&s;tone precipices. Within the bay, the town became gradually vi&s;ible; lights twinkled between the trees, appearing and vani&s;hing, like the &s;tars of a cloudy night; and, at length was heard the melancholy &s;ong of boatmen, who were fi&s;hing near the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Other &s;ounds &s;oon after &s;truck the ear. "O, what merry notes!" exclaimed Paulo, "they make my heart dance. See! Signora, there is a groupe, footing it away &s;o gaily on the bank of the lake yonder, by tho&s;e trees. O, what merry &s;et! Would I were among them! that is, I mean, if you, Mae&s;tro, and the Sig|nora were not here."</P>
<P>"Well corrected, Paulo."</P>
<P>"It is a fe&s;tival, I fancy," ob&s;erved Vivaldi.&mdash;The&s;e pea&s;ants of the lake can make the moments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as gaily as the voluptuaries of the city, it &s;eems."</P>
<P>"O! what merry mu&s;ic!" repeated Paulo. "Ah! how often I have footed it as joyou&s;ly on the beach at Naples, after &s;un-&s;et, of a fine night, like this; with &s;uch a plea&s;ant fre&s;h breeze to cool one! Ah! there are none like the fi&s;hermen of Naples for a dance by moonlight; how lightly they do trip it! O! if I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut there now! That is, I mean, if you, Mae&s;tro, and the Signora were there too. O! what merry notes!"</P>
<P>"We thank you, good Signor Paulo," &s;aid Vi|valdi, "and I tru&s;t we &s;hall all be there &s;oon; when you &s;hall trip it away, with as joyous a heart as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t of them."</P>
<P>The travellers now entered the town, which con|&s;i&s;ted of one &s;treet, &s;traggling along the margin of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; and having enquired for the Ur&s;aline convent,
<PB N="232" REF="032735_0230_0FF494FDE1C32C58">
were directed to its gates. The portre&s;s appeared immediately upon the ringing of the bell, and carried a me&s;&s;age to the Abbe&s;s, who as quickly returned an invitation to Ellena. She alighted, and followed the portre&s;s to the parlour, while Vivaldi remained at the gate, till he &s;hould know whether &s;he approved of her new lodging. A &s;econd invitation induced him al&s;o to alight; he was admitted to the grate, and offered refre&s;hment, which, however, he declined &s;taying to accept, as he had yet a lodging to &s;eek for the night. The Abbe&s;s, on learning this circum&s;tance, courte|ou&s;ly recommended him to a neighbouring &s;ociety of Benedictines, and de&s;ired him to mention her name to the Abbot.</P>
<P>Vivaldi then took leave of Ellena, and, though it was only for a few hours, he left her with dejection, and with &s;ome degree of apprehen&s;ion for her &s;afety, which, though circum&s;tances could not ju&s;tify him in admitting, he could not entirely &s;ubdue. She &s;hared his dejection, but not his fears, when the door clo&s;ed after him, and &s;he found her&s;elf once more among &s;trangers. The forlornne&s;s of her feelings could not be entirely overcome by the attentions of the Abbe&s;s; and there was a degree of curio&s;ity, and even of &s;cru|tiny, expre&s;&s;ed in the looks of &s;ome of the &s;i&s;ters, which &s;eemed more than was due to a &s;tranger. From &s;uch examination &s;he eagerly e&s;caped to the repo&s;e from which &s;he had &s;o long been withheld.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, meanwhile, had found an ho&s;pitable recep|tion with the Benedictines, who&s;e &s;eque&s;tered &s;itua|tion made the vi&s;it of a &s;tranger a plea&s;urable novelty to them. In the eagerne&s;s of conver&s;ation, and, yield|ing to the &s;atisfaction which the mind receives from exerci&s;ing ideas that have long &s;lept in du&s;ky indo|lence, and to the plea&s;ure of admitting new ones, the Abbot and a few of the brothers &s;at with Vivaldi to a late hour. When, at length, the traveller was &s;uf|fered
<PB N="233" REF="032735_0231_0FF494FF69CA97D8">
to retire, other &s;ubjects than tho&s;e, which had intere&s;ted his ho&s;t, engaged his thoughts; and he re|volved the means of preventing the mi&s;ery that threat|ened him, in a &s;erious &s;eparation from Ellena. Now, that &s;he was received into a re&s;pectable a&s;ylum, every motive for &s;ilence upon this topic was done away. He determined, therefore, that on the following morn|ing, he would urge all his rea&s;ons and entreaties for an immediate marriage; and among the brothers of the Benedictines, he had little doubt of prevailing with one to &s;olemnize the nuptials, which he believed would place his happine&s;s and Ellena's peace, beyond the influence of malignant po&s;&s;ibilities.</P>

<P>WHILE Vivaldi and Ellena were on the way from San Stefano, the Marche&s;e Vivaldi was &s;uffering the utmo&s;t vexation, re&s;pecting his &s;on; and the Mar|che&s;a felt not le&s;s apprehen&s;ion, that the abode of El|lena might be di&s;covered; yet this fear did not with|hold her from mingling in all the gaieties of Naples. Her a&s;&s;emblies were, as u&s;ual, among the mo&s;t brilliant of that voluptuous city, and &s;he patronized, as zealou&s;|ly as b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">fore, the &s;trains of her favourite compo&s;er. But, notwith&s;tanding this perpetual di&s;&s;ipation, her thoughts frequently withdrew them&s;elves from the &s;cene, and dwelt on gloomy forebodings of di&s;appoint|ed pride.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance, which rendered her particularly &s;u&s;ceptible to &s;uch di&s;appointment at this time, was, that overtures of alliance had been lately made to the Marche&s;e, by the father of a lady, who was held &s;uit|able, in every con&s;ideration, to become his daughter; and who&s;e wealth rendered the union particularly de|&s;irable at a time, when the expences of &s;uch an e&s;ta|bli&s;hment as was nece&s;&s;ary to the vanity of the Mar|che&s;a, con&s;iderably exceeded his income, large as it was.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a's temper had been thus irritated by the contemplation of her &s;on's conduct in an affair, which &s;o materially affected the fortune, and, as &s;he believed, the honour of his family; when a courier
<PB N="235" REF="032735_0233_0FF49500F11B8C68">
from the Abbe&s;s of San Stefano brought intelligence of the flight of Ellena with Vivaldi. She was in a di&s;po&s;ition, which heightened di&s;appointment into fury; and &s;he forfeited, by the tran&s;ports to which &s;he yielded, the degree of pity that otherwi&s;e was due to a mother, who believed her only &s;on to have &s;acrificed his family and him&s;elf to an unworthy pa&s;&s;ion. She believed, that he was now married, and irrecoverably lo&s;t. Scarcely able to endure the agony of this con|viction, &s;he &s;ent for her antient advi&s;er Schedoni, that &s;he might, at lea&s;t, have the relief of expre&s;&s;ing her emotion; and of examining whether there remained a po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;&s;olving the&s;e long-dreaded nuptials. The phrenzy of pa&s;&s;ion, however, did not &s;o far over|come her circum&s;pection as to compel her to acquaint the Marche&s;e with the contents of the Abbe&s;s's letter, before &s;he had con&s;ulted with her Confe&s;&s;or. She knew that the principles of her hu&s;band were too ju&s;t, upon the grand points of morality, to &s;uffer him to a|dopt the mea&s;ures &s;he might judge nece&s;&s;ary; and &s;he avoided informing him of the marriage of his &s;on, until the means of counteracting it &s;hould have been &s;ug|ge&s;ted and accompli&s;hed, however de&s;perate &s;uch means might be.</P>
<P>Schedoni was not to be found. Trifling circum|&s;tances encrea&s;e the irritation of a mind in &s;uch a &s;tate as was her's. The delay of an opportunity for un|burthening her heart to Schedoni, was hardly to be en|dured; another and another me&s;&s;enger were di&s;patched to her Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"My mi&s;tre&s;s has committed &s;ome great &s;in, truely!" &s;aid the &s;ervant, who had been twice to the convent within the la&s;t half hour. "It mu&s;t lie heavy on her con&s;cience, in good truth, &s;ince &s;he cannot &s;upport it for one half hour. Well! the rich have this comfort, however, that, let them be ever &s;o guilty, they can buy them&s;elves innocent again, in the twinkling of a
<PB N="236" REF="032735_0234_0FF4955ED44CB760">
ducat. Now a poor man might be a month before he recovered his innocence, and that, too, not till after many a bout of hard flogging."</P>
<P>In the evening Schedoni came, but it was only to confirm her wor&s;t fear. He, too, had heard of the e&s;cape of Ellena, as well as that &s;he was on the lake of Celano, and was married to Vivaldi. How he had obtained this information he did not chu&s;e to di&s;clo&s;e, but he mentioned &s;o many minute circum&s;tances in confirmation of its truth, and appeared to be &s;o per|fectly convinced of the facts he related, that the Mar|che&s;a believed them, as implicitly as him&s;elf; and her pa&s;&s;ion and de&s;pair tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed all bounds of decorum.</P>
<P>Schedoni ob&s;erved, with dark and &s;ilent plea&s;ure, the turbulent exce&s;s of her feelings; and perceived that the moment was now arrived, when he might command them to his purpo&s;e, &s;o as to render his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance indi&s;pen&s;able to her repo&s;e: and probably &s;o as to accompli&s;h the revenge he had long mediated again&s;t Vivaldi, without hazarding the favour of the Marche|&s;a. So far was he from attempting to &s;ooth her &s;uf|ferings, that he continued to irr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate her re&s;entment, and exa&s;perate her pride; effecting this, at the &s;ame time, with &s;uch imperceptible art, that he appeared on|ly to be palliating the conduct of Vivaldi, and endea|vouring to con&s;ole his di&s;tracted mother.</P>
<P>"This is a ra&s;h &s;tep, certainly," &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or; "but he is young, very young, and therefore, does not fore&s;ee the con&s;equence to which it leads. He does not perceive how &s;eriou&s;ly it will affect the dignity of his hou&s;e;&mdash;how much it will depreciate his con&s;e|quence with the court, with the nobles of his own rank, and even with the plebeians, with whom he has conde&s;cended to connect him&s;elf.

<P>"Your excu&s;es, reverend father," &s;aid the tortured Marche&s;a, "prove the goodne&s;s of your heart; but they illu&s;trate, al&s;o, the degeneracy of his mind, and detail the full extent of the effects which he has brought upon his family. It affords me no con&s;olation to know, that this degradation proceeds from his head, rather than his heart; it is &s;ufficient that he has incurred it, and that no po&s;&s;ibility remains of throw|ing off the misfortune."</P>
<P>"Perhaps that is affirming too much," ob&s;erved Schedoni.</P>
<P>"How, father!" &s;aid the Merche&s;a.</P>
<P>"Perhaps a po&s;&s;ibility does remain," &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"Point it out to me, good father! I do not per|ceive it."</P>
<P>"Nay, my lady," replied the &s;ubtle Schedoni, co|recting him&s;elf, "I am by no means a&s;&s;ured, that &s;uch po&s;&s;ibility does exi&s;t. My &s;olicitude, for your tranquility, and for the honour of your hou&s;e, makes me &s;o unwilling to relinqui&s;h hope, that, perhaps, I only imagine a po&s;&s;ibility in your favour. Let me con|&s;ider.&mdash;Alas! the misfortune, &s;evere as it is, mu&s;t be endured; there remain no means of e&s;caping from it."</P>
<P>"It was cruel of you, father, to &s;ugge&s;t a hope which you could not ju&s;tify," ob&s;erved the Marche&s;a.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t excu&s;e my extreme &s;olicitude, then," re|plied the confe&s;&s;or." "But how is it po&s;&s;ible for me to &s;ee a family of your ancient e&s;timation brought into &s;uch circum&s;tances; its honours blighted by the folly of a thoughtle&s;s boy, without feeling &s;orrow and indig|nation, and looking round for even &s;ome de&s;perate means of delivering it from di&s;grace." He pau&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="032735_0236_0FF4950E9E8798F8">
"Di&s;grace!" exclaimed the Marche&s;a, "father, you&mdash;you&mdash;Di&s;grace!&mdash;The word is a &s;trong one, but&mdash;it is, alas! ju&s;t. And &s;hall we &s;ubmit to this?&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible we <HI>can</HI> &s;ubmit to it?"</P>
<P>"There is no remedy," &s;aid Schedoni, coolly.</P>
<P>"Good God! exclaimed the Marche&s;a "that there &s;hould be no law to prevent, or, at lea&s;t, to puni&s;h &s;uch criminal marriages?"</P>
<P>"It is much to be lamented," replied Schedoni.</P>
<P>"The woman who obtrudes her&s;elf upon a family, to di&s;honour it," continued the Marche&s;a, "de&s;erves a puni&s;hment nearly equal to that of a &s;tate criminal, &s;ince &s;he injures tho&s;e who be&s;t &s;upport the &s;tate. She ought to &s;uffer"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Not nearly, but quite equal," interrupted the con|fe&s;&s;or, "&s;he de&s;erves&mdash;death!"</P>
<P>He pau&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and there was a moment of profound &s;i|lence, till he added&mdash;"for death only can obliviate the degradation &s;he has occa&s;ioned; her death alone can re&s;tore the original &s;plendor of the line &s;he would have &s;ullied."</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed again, but the Marche&s;a &s;till remaining &s;ilent, he added, "I have often marvelled that our law|givers &s;hould have failed to perceive the ju&s;tne&s;s, nay the nece&s;&s;ity, of &s;uch puni&s;hment!"</P>
<P>"It is a&s;toni&s;hing," &s;aid the Marche&s;a, thoughtful|ly, "that a regard for their own honor did not &s;ug|ge&s;t it."</P>
<P>"Ju&s;tice does not the le&s;s exi&s;t, becau&s;e her laws are neglected," ob&s;erved Schedoni. "A &s;en&s;e of what &s;he commands lives in our brea&s;ts; and when we fail to obey that &s;en&s;e, is is to weakne&s;s, not to virtue, that we yield."</P>
<P>"Certainly," replied the Marche&s;a, "that truth ne|ver yet was doubted."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, I am not &s;o certain as to that," &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or; "when ju&s;tice happens to oppo&s;e pre|judice,
<PB N="239" REF="032735_0237_0FF4950D0C256FA0">
we are apt to believe it virtuous to di&s;obey her. For in&s;tance, though the law of ju&s;tice demands the death of this girl, yet becau&s;e the law of the land forbears to enforce it, you, my daughter, even you! though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a man's &s;pirit, and his clear per|ceptions, would think that virtue bade her live, when it was only fear!"</P>
<P>"Ha!" exclaimed the Marche&s;a, in a low voice, "What is that you mean? You &s;hall find I have a man's courage al&s;o."</P>
<P>"I &s;peak without di&s;gui&s;e." replied Schedoni, "my meaning requires none."</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a mu&s;ed, and remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"I have done my duty," re&s;umed Schedoni, at length. "I have pointed out the only way that re|mains for you to e&s;cape di&s;honor. If my zeal is di&s;|plea&s;ing&mdash;but I have none."</P>
<P>"No, good father, no," &s;aid the Marche&s;a; you mi&s;take the cau&s;e of my emotion. New ideas, new pro&s;pects, open!&mdash;they confu&s;e, they di&s;tract me My mind has not yet attained &s;ufficient &s;trength to encounter them; &s;ome woman's weakne&s;s &s;till lin|gers at my heart."</P>
<P>"Pardon my incon&s;iderate zeal," &s;aid Schedoni, with affected humility, "I have been to blame. If your's is a weakne&s;s, it is, at lea&s;t, an amiable one, and, perhaps, de&s;erves to be encouraged, rather than conquered."</P>
<P>"How, father! If it de&s;erves encouragement, it is not a weakne&s;s, but a virtue."</P>
<P>"Be it &s;o," &s;aid Schedoni, coolly, "the intere&s;t I have felt on this &s;ubject, has, perhaps, mi&s;led my judg|ment, and has made unju&s;t. Think no more of it, or, if you do, let it be only to pardon the zeal I have te&s;tified."</P>
<P>"It does not de&s;erve pardon, but thanks," replied the Marche&s;a, "not thanks only, but reward. Good

father, I hope it will &s;ome time be in my power to prove the &s;incerity of my words."</P>
<P>The Confe&s;&s;or bowed his head.</P>
<P>"I tru&s;t that the &s;ervices you have rendered me, &s;hall be gratefully repaid&mdash;rewarded, I dare not hope, for what benefit could po&s;&s;ibly reward a &s;ervice &s;o va&s;t, as it may, perhaps, be in your power to confer upon my family! What recompence could be balanced a|gain&s;t the benefit of having re&s;cued the honor of an ancient hou&s;e!"</P>
<P>"Your goodne&s;s is beyond my thanks, or my de|&s;ert," &s;aid Schedoni, and he was again &s;ilent.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a wi&s;hed him to lead her back to the point, from which &s;he her&s;elf had deviated, and he &s;eemed determined, that &s;he &s;hould lead him thither. She mu&s;ed, and he&s;itated. Her mind was not yet fa|miliar with attrocious guilt; and the crime which Schedoni had &s;ugge&s;ted, &s;omewhat alarmed her. She &s;eared to think, and &s;till more to name it; yet, &s;o a|cutely &s;u&s;ceptible was her pride, &s;o &s;tern her indigna|tion, and &s;o profound her de&s;ire of vengeance, that her mind was to&s;&s;ed as on a tempe&s;tuous ocean, and the&s;e terrible feelings threatened to overwhelm all the re&s;i|due of humanity in her heart. Schedoni ob&s;erved all its progre&s;&s;ive movements, and, like a gaunt tyger, lurked in &s;ilence, ready to &s;pring forward at the mo|ment of opportunity.</P>
<P>"Is it your advice, then, father," re&s;umed the Mar|che&s;a, after a long pau&s;e,&mdash;"is it your opinion&mdash;that Ellena"&mdash;She he&s;itated, de&s;irous that Schedoni &s;hould anticipate her meaning; but he cho&s;e to &s;pare his own delicacy rather than that of the Marche&s;a.</P>
<P>"You think, then, that this in&s;idious girl de&s;erves"&mdash;She pau&s;ed again, but the Confe&s;&s;or, &s;till &s;ilent, &s;eemed to wait with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion for what the Marche&s;a &s;hould deliver.</P>
<P>"I repeat, father, that it is your opinion this girl de&s;erves &s;evere puni&s;hment."&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="032735_0239_0FF49510271DBBA0">
Undoubtedly replied Schedoni, "It is not al&s;o your own?"</P>
<P>"That not any puni&s;hment can be too &s;evere?" continued the Marche&s;a. "That ju&s;tice, equally with nece&s;&s;ity, demands&mdash;her life? Is not this your opinion too?"</P>
<P>"O! pardon me," &s;aid Schedoni, "I may have erred; that only <HI>was</HI> my opinion; and when I form|ed it, I was probably too much under the influence of zeal to be ju&s;t. When the heart is warm, how is it po&s;&s;ible that the judgment can be cool?"</P>
<P>"It is not then, your opinion, holy father," &s;aid the Marche&s;a with di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>"I do not ab&s;olutely &s;ay that," replied the Confe&s;&s;or&mdash;"But I leave it to your better judgment to decide upon its ju&s;tne&s;s."</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, he ro&s;e to depart. The Marche&s;a was agitated and perplexed, and reque&s;ted he would &s;tay; but he excu&s;ed him&s;elf by alledging that it was the hour he mu&s;t attend a particular ma&s;s.</P>
<P>"Well then holy father, I will occupy no more of your valuable moments at pre&s;ent; but you know I highly e&s;timate your advice, and will not refu&s;e, when I &s;hall at &s;ome future time reque&s;t it."</P>
<P>"I cannot refu&s;e to accept an honour," replied the Confe&s;&s;or, with an air of meekne&s;s, "but the &s;ubject you allude to is delicate,"&mdash;</P>
<P>"And therefore I mu&s;t value, and require your o|pinion upon it," rejoined the Marche&s;a.</P>
<P>"I would wi&s;h you to value your own," replied Schedoni; "you cannot have a better director."</P>
<P>"You flatter, father."</P>
<P>"I only reply, my daughter."</P>
<P>"On the evening of to-morrow, &s;aid the Marche&s;|&s;a, gravely, "I &s;hall be at ve&s;pers in the church of San Nicolo; if you &s;hould happen to be there, you will probably &s;ee me, when the &s;ervice is over, and the

<P>"Peace be with you, daughter! and wi&s;dom coun|&s;el your thoughts!" replied Schedoni, I will not fail to vi&s;it San Nicholo."</P>
<P>He folded his hands upon his brea&s;t, bowed his head, and left the apartment with the &s;ilent foot-&s;tep, that indicates wearine&s;s and con&s;cious duplicity.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a remained in her clo&s;et, &s;haken by e|ver verying pa&s;&s;ions, and ever-fluctuating opinions; meditating mi&s;ery for others, and inflicting it only up|on her&s;elf.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Marche&s;a repaired, according to her ap|pointment, to the church of San Nicolo, and, ordering her &s;ervants to remain with the carriage at a &s;ide-door, entered the choir attended only by her woman.</P>
<P>When ve&s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s had concluded, &s;he lingered till near|ly every per&s;on had quitted the choir, and then walk|ed through the &s;olitary ai&s;le, to the north cloi&s;ter. Her heart was as heavy as her &s;tep; for when is it that peace and evil pa&s;&s;ions dwell together? As &s;he &s;lowly paced the cloi&s;ters, &s;he perceived a monk pa&s;&s;ing between on the pillars, who, as he approached, lifted his crowl, and &s;he knew him to be Schedoni.</P>
<P>He in&s;tantly ob&s;erved the agitation of her &s;pirits, and that her purpo&s;e was not yet determined according to his hope. But, though his mind became cloud|ed, his countenance remained unaltered; it was grave and thoughtful. The &s;ternne&s;s of his vulture-eye was, however, &s;omewhat &s;oftened, and its lids were contrac|ted by &s;ubtlety.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a bade her woman walk apart, while &s;he conferred with her Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"This unhappy boy" &s;aid &s;he, when the attendant was at &s;ome di&s;tance, "How much &s;uffering does his folly inflict upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s family! My good father, I have need of all your advice and con&s;olation. My mind is perpetually haunted by a &s;en&s;e of my misfortune; it
<PB N="244" REF="032735_0242_0FF4956DA89A97A0">
has no re&s;pite; awake, or in my dream, this ungrateful &s;on alike pur&s;ues me! The only relief my heart re|ceives is when conver&s;ing with you&mdash;my only coun|&s;ellor, my only di&s;intere&s;ted friend."</P>
<P>The Confe&s;&s;or bowed. "The Marche&s;a is no doubt, equally afflicted with your&s;elf," &s;aid he; "but he is notwith&s;tanding, much more competent to ad|vi&s;e you on this delicate &s;ubject than I am."</P>
<P>"The Marche&s;a has prejudices, father, as you well know; he is a &s;en&s;ible man, but he is &s;ometimes mi&s;|taken, and he is incorrigible in error. He has the faults of a mind that is merely well di&s;po&s;ed; he is de&s;|titute of the de&s;cernment and the energy which would make it great. If it is nece&s;&s;ary to adopt a conduct, that departs in the &s;malle&s;t degree from tho&s;e common rules of morality which he has cheri&s;hed, without ex|amining them, from his infancy, he is &s;hocked, and &s;hrinks from action. He cannot di&s;crimnate the cir|cum&s;tances, that render the &s;ame action virtuous or vicious. How then, father, are we to &s;uppo&s;e he would approve of the bold inflictions we meditate?"</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t true!" &s;aid the artful Schedoni, with an air of admiration,</P>
<P>"We therefore, mu&s;t not con&s;ult him," continued the Marche&s;a, "le&s;t he &s;hould now, as formerly, ad|vance and maintain objections, to which we cannot yield. What pa&s;&s;es in conver&s;ation with you, father, is &s;acred, it goes no farther,"</P>
<P>"Sacred as a confe&s;&s;ion!" &s;aid Schedoni, cro&s;&s;ing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"I know not,"&mdash;re&s;umed the Marche&s;a, and he&s;i|tated; "I know not"&mdash;&s;he repeated in a yet lower voice, "how this girl may be di&s;po&s;ed of; and this it is which di&s;tracts my mind."</P>
<P>"I marvel much at that," &s;aid Schedoni. "With opinions &s;o &s;ingularly ju&s;t, with a mind &s;o accurate, yet &s;o bold as you have di&s;played, is it po&s;&s;ible that you
<PB N="245" REF="032735_0243_0FF4951D069B8F10">
can he&s;itate at what is to be done! You, my daugh|ter, will not prove your&s;elf one of tho&s;e ineffectual de|claimers, who can think vigorou&s;ly, but cannot act &s;o! One way, only, remains for you to pur&s;ue, in the pre|&s;ent in&s;tance; it is the &s;ame which your &s;uperiour &s;aga|city pointed out, and taught me to approve. Is it ne|ce&s;&s;ary for me to per&s;uade <HI>her,</HI> by whom I am con|vinced? There is only one way."</P>
<P>"And on that I have been long meditating," re|plied the Marche&s;a, "and, &s;hall I own my weakne&s;s? I cannot yet decide."</P>
<P>"My daughter! can it be po&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould want courage to &s;oar above vulgar prejudice, in action, though not in opinion?" &s;aid Schedoni, who, perceiv|ing that his a&s;&s;i&s;tance was nece&s;&s;ary to fix her fluctu|ating mind, gradually began to &s;teal forth from the pru|dent re&s;erve, in which he had taken &s;helter.</P>
<P>"If this per&s;on was condemned by the law," he continued, "you would pronounce her &s;entence to be ju&s;t; yet you dare not, I am humbled while I re|peat it, you dare not di&s;pen&s;e ju&s;tice your&s;elf."</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a, after &s;ome he&s;itation, &s;aid, "I have not the &s;hield of the law to protect me, father: and the bolde&s;t virtue may pau&s;e, when it reaches the utmo&s;t verge of &s;afety."</P>
<P>"Never!" replied the Confe&s;&s;or, warmly; "vir|tue never trembles; it is her glory, and &s;ublime&s;t attri|bute to be &s;uperior to danger, to de&s;pi&s;e it. The be&s;t principle is not virtue till it reaches this eleva|tion."</P>
<P>A philo&s;opher might, perhaps, have been &s;urprized to hear two per&s;ons &s;eriou&s;ly defining the limits of vir|tue, at the very moment in which they medi|tated the mo&s;t atrocious crime; a man of the world would have con&s;idered it to be mere hypocri&s;y; a &s;up|po&s;ition which might have di&s;clo&s;ed his general know|ledge of manners, but would certainly have betrayed his ignorance of the human heart.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="032735_0244_0FF49570129AE4C8">
The Marche&s;a was for &s;ome time &s;ilent and thought|ful, and then repeated, deliberately, "I have not the &s;hield of the law to protect me."</P>
<P>"But you have the &s;hield of the church," replied Schedoni; "you &s;hould not only have protection, but ab&s;olution."</P>
<P>"Ab&s;olution!&mdash;Does virtue&mdash;ju&s;tice, require ab|&s;olution father?"</P>
<P>"When I mention ab&s;olution for the action which you perceive to be &s;o ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary," replied Sche|doni, "I accommodated my &s;peech to vulgar preju|dice, and to vulgar weakne&s;s. And, forgive me, that &s;ince you, my daughter, de&s;cended from the loftine&s;s of your &s;pirit to regret the &s;hield of the law, I endea|voured to con&s;ole you, by offering a &s;hield to con&s;ci|ence. But enough of this; let us return to argument. This girl is put out of the way of committing more mi&s;chief, of injuring the peace and dignity of a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed family; &s;he is &s;ent to an eternal &s;leep, before her time.&mdash;Where is the crime, where is the evil of this? On the contrary, you perceive, and you have convinced me, that it is only &s;trict ju&s;tice, only &s;elf|defence."</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a was attentive, and the confe&s;&s;or add|e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> "She is not immortal; and the few years more, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> might have been allotted her, &s;he de&s;erves to for|feit, &s;ince &s;he would have employed them in cankering the honour of an illu&s;trious hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"Speak low, father," &s;aid the Marche&s;a, though he &s;poke almo&s;t in a whi&s;per; "the cloi&s;ter appears &s;oli|tary, yet &s;ome per&s;on may lurk behind tho&s;e pillars. Advi&s;e me how this bu&s;ine&s;s may be managed; I am ignorant of the particular means."</P>
<P>"There is &s;ome hazard in the accompli&s;hment of it I grant," replied Schedoni, "I know not whom you may confide in.&mdash;The men who make a trade of blood"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="032735_0245_0FF4951E8C3E0498">
"Hu&s;h!" &s;aid the Marche&s;a, looking round through the twilight&mdash;"a &s;tep!"</P>
<P>"It is the Friar's, yonder, who cro&s;&s;es to the choir," replied Schedoni.</P>
<P>They were watchful for a few moments, and then he re&s;umed the &s;ubject, "Mercenaries ought not to be tru&s;ted,"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Yet who but mercenaries"&mdash;interrupted the Mar|che&s;a, and in&s;tantly checked her&s;elf. But the que&s;tion thus implied, did not e&s;cape the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"Pardon my a&s;toni&s;hment," &s;aid he, "at the incon|&s;i&s;tency, or, what &s;hall I venture to call it? of your opinions! After the acutene&s;s you have di&s;played on &s;ome points, is it po&s;&s;ible you can doubt, that princi|ple may both prompt and perform the deed? Why &s;hould we he&s;itate to do what we judge to be right?"</P>
<P>"Ah! reverend father," &s;aid the Marche&s;a, with emotion, "but where &s;hall we find another like your|&s;elf&mdash;another, who not only can perceive with ju&s;tne&s;s, but will act with energy?"</P>
<P>Schedoni was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Such a friend is above all e&s;timation; but where &s;hall we &s;eek him?"</P>
<P>"Daughter!" &s;aid the monk, emphatically, "my zeal for your family is above all calculation."</P>
<P>"Good father," replied the Marche&s;a, comprehend|ing his full meaning, "I know not how to thank you."</P>
<P>"Silence is &s;ometimes eloquence," &s;aid Schedoni, &s;ignificantly.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a mu&s;ed, for her con&s;cience al&s;o was eloquent. She tried to overcome its voice, but it would be heard; and &s;ometimes &s;uch &s;tarts of horrible conviction came over her mind, that &s;he felt as one who, awaking from a dream, opens his eyes only to mea&s;ure the depth of the precipice on which he totters In &s;uch moments &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed, that &s;he had pau&s;|ed

for an in&s;tant upon a &s;ubject &s;o terrible as that of murder. The &s;ophi&s;try of the confe&s;&s;or, together with the incon&s;i&s;tencies he had betrayed, and which had not e&s;caped the notice of the Marche&s;a, even at the time they were uttered, though &s;he had been un|con&s;cious of her own, then became more &s;trongly ap|parent, and &s;he almo&s;t determined to &s;uffer the poor Ellena to Live. But returning pa&s;&s;ion, like a wave that has recoiled from the &s;hore, afterwards came with recollected energy, and &s;wept from her feeble mind, the barriers, which rea&s;on and con&s;cience had begun to rear.</P>
<P>"This confidence with which you have thought proper to honor me," &s;aid Schedoni, at length, and pau&s;ed; "This affair &s;o momentous"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Ay, this affair," interrupted the Marche&s;a, in a hurried manner,&mdash;"but when, and where, good fa|ther? Being once convinced, I am anxious to have it &s;ettled."</P>
<P>"That mu&s;t be as occa&s;ion offers," replied the Monk, thoughtfully.&mdash;"On the &s;hore of the Adriatic, in the province of Apulia; not far from Manfredonia, is a hou&s;e that might &s;uit the purpo&s;e. It is a lone dwelling on the beach, and concealed from travellers, among the fore&s;ts which &s;pread for many miles along the coa&s;t."</P>
<P>"And the people?" &s;aid the Marche&s;a.</P>
<P>"Ay, daughter, or why travel &s;o far as Apulia? It is inhabited by one poor man, who &s;u&s;tains a mi&s;era|ble exi&s;tence by fi&s;hing. I know him, and could un|fold the rea&s;on of his &s;olitary life;&mdash;but no matter, it is &s;ufficient that I <HI>know him.</HI>"</P>
<P>"And would tru&s;t him, father?"</P>
<P>"Ay, lady, with the life of this girl&mdash;though &s;carcely with my own."</P>
<P>"How! If he is &s;uch a villian he may not be tru&s;t|ed!
<PB N="249" REF="032735_0247_0FF4952014499698">
think further. But now, you objected to a mer|cenary, yet this man is one!"</P>
<P>"Daughter, he may be tru&s;ted, when it is in &s;uch a ca&s;e; he is &s;afe and &s;ure. I have rea&s;on to know him."</P>
<P>"Name your rea&s;ons, father."</P>
<P>The Confe&s;&s;or was &s;ilent and his countenance a&s;|&s;umed a very peculiar character; it was more terri|ble than u&s;ual, and over&s;pread with a dark, cadaverous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ue of mingled anger and guilt The Marche&s;a &s;tart|ed involuntarily as, pa&s;&s;ing by a window, the evening gleam that fell there, di&s;covered it; and for the fir&s;t time &s;he wi&s;hed, that &s;he had not committed her&s;elf &s;o wholly to his power. But the die was now ca&s;t; it was too late to be prudent; and &s;he again demand|ed his rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>"No matter," &s;aid Schedoni, in a &s;tifled voice&mdash;"&s;he dies!"</P>
<P>"By his hands?" a&s;ked the Marche&s;a, with &s;trong emotion. "Think, once more, father."</P>
<P>They were both again &s;ilent and thoughtful The Marche&s;a, at length, &s;aid, "Father, I rely upon your integrity and prudence;" and &s;he laid a very flatter|ing empha&s;is upon the word integrity. "But I con|jure you to let this bu&s;ine&s;s be fini&s;hed quickly; &s;u&s;|pence is to me the purgatory of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> world, and not to tru&s;t the accompli&s;hment of it to a &s;econd per&s;on." She pau&s;ed and then added, "I would not willingly owe &s;o va&s;t a debt of obligation to any other than your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Your reque&s;t, daughter, that I would not con|fide this bu&s;ine&s;s to a &s;econd per&s;on, &s;aid Schedoni, with di&s;plea&s;ure, "cannot be accorded to. Can you &s;uppo&s;e, that I my&s;elf"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Can I doubt that principle may both prompt and perform the deed," interrupted the Marche&s;a with quicne&s;s, and anticipating his meaning, while
<PB N="250" REF="032735_0248_0FF4957A26BFAD80">
&s;he retorted upon him his former words. "Why &s;hould we he&s;itate to do what we judge to be right?"</P>
<P>The &s;ilence of Schedoni alone indicated his di&s;|plea&s;ure, which the Marche&s;a immediately under&s;tood.</P>
<P>"Con&s;ider, good father," &s;he added &s;ignificantly, "how painful it mu&s;t be to me, to owe &s;o infinite an obligation to a &s;tranger, or to any other than &s;o high|ly valued a friend as your&s;elf."</P>
<P>Schedoni, while he detected her meaning, and per|&s;uaded him&s;elf that he di&s;pi&s;ed the flattery, with which &s;he &s;o thinly veiled it, uncon&s;ciou&s;ly &s;uffered his &s;elf-love to be &s;oothed by the compliment. He bowed his head, in &s;ignal of con&s;ent to her wi&s;h.</P>
<P>"Avoid violence, if that be po&s;&s;ible," &s;he added, immediately comprehending him, "but let her di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> quickly! The puni&s;hment is due to the crime."</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a happened, as &s;he &s;aid this, to ca&s;t her eyes upon the in&s;cription over a Confe&s;&s;ional, where appeared, in black letters, the&s;e awful words, <HI>"God hears thee!"</HI> It appeared an awful warning. Her countenance changed; it had &s;truck upon her heart. Schedoni was too much engaged by his own thoughts to ob&s;erve, or under&s;tand her &s;ilence. She &s;oon recovered her&s;elf; and con&s;idering that this was a common in&s;cription for Confe&s;&s;ionals, di&s;regarded what &s;he at fir&s;t con&s;idered as a peculiar admonition; yet &s;ome moments elap&s;ed, before &s;he could renew the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>"You were &s;peaking of a place, father," re&s;umed the Marche&s;a&mdash;"you mentioned a"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Ay," muttered the Confe&s;&s;or, &s;till mu&s;ing&mdash;"in a chamber of that hou&s;e there is"&mdash;</P>
<P>"What noi&s;e is that?" &s;aid the Marche&s;a, inter|rupting him. They li&s;tened. A few low and que|rulous notes of the organ &s;ounded at a di&s;tance, and &s;topped again.</P>
<P>"What mournful mu&s;ic is that?" &s;aid the Marche|&s;a
<PB N="251" REF="032735_0249_0FF495C2CDC09D58">
in a faultering voice, "It was touched by a fearful hand! Ve&s;pers were over long ago."</P>
<P>"Daughter," &s;aid Schedoni, &s;omewhat &s;ternly, "you &s;aid a man's courage. Alas! you have a woman's heart."</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me father; I know not why I feel this a|gitation, but I will command it. That chamber?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"In that chamber," re&s;umed the Confe&s;&s;or, "is a &s;ecret door, con&s;tructed long ago."&mdash;</P>
<P>"And for what purpo&s;e con&s;tructed?" &s;aid the fearful Marche&s;a.</P>
<P>"Pardon me daughter; 'tis &s;ufficient that it is there: we will make a good u&s;e of it. Through that door&mdash;in the night&mdash;when &s;he &s;leeps"&mdash;</P>
<P>"I comprehend you," &s;aid the Marche&s;a, "I com|prehend you. But why, you have your rea&s;ons, no doubt, but why the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;ecret door in a hou&s;e which you &s;ay is &s;o lonely&mdash;inhabited by only one per&s;on?"</P>
<P>"A pa&s;&s;age leads to the &s;ea," continued Schedoni, without replying to the que&s;tion. "There, on the &s;hore, when darkne&s;s covers it; there, plunged amid&s;t the waves, no &s;tain &s;hall hint of"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Hark!" interrupted the Marche&s;a, &s;tarting, "that note again!"</P>
<P>The organ &s;ounded faintly from the choir, and pau&s;ed, as before. In the next moment a flow chaunt|ing of voices was heard, mingling with the ri&s;ing peal, in a &s;train particularly melancholy and &s;olemn.</P>
<P>"Who is dead?" &s;aid the Marche&s;a, changing countenance; "it is a requiem!"</P>
<P>"Peace be with the departed!" exclaimed Schedo|ni, and cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf; "Peace re&s;t with his &s;oul!"</P>
<P>"Hark! to that chaunt!" &s;aid the Marche&s;a, in a trembling voice; "it is a fir&s;t requiem; the &s;oul has but ju&s;t quitted the body!"</P>
<P>They li&s;tened in &s;ilence. The Marche&s;a was much
<PB N="252" REF="032735_0250_0FF4957BAE242240">
affected; her complexion varied at every in&s;tant; her breathings were &s;hort and interrupted, and &s;he even &s;hed a few tears, but they were tho&s;e of de&s;pair, rather than of &s;orrow. "That body is now cold," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "which but an hour ago was warm and animated! Tho&s;e fine &s;en&s;es are clo&s;ed in death! And to this condition would I reduce a being like my&s;elf! Oh, wretched, wretched mother! to what has the folly of a &s;on reduced thee."</P>
<P>She turned from the Confe&s;&s;or, and walked alone in the cloi&s;ter. Her agitation encrea&s;ed; &s;he wept without re&s;traint, for her veil and the evening gloom concealed her, and her &s;ighs were lo&s;t amid&s;t the mu|&s;ic of the choir,</P>
<P>Schedoni was &s;carcely le&s;s di&s;turbed, but his were emotions of apprehen&s;ion and contempt. "Behold, what is woman!" &s;aid he&mdash;"The &s;lave of her pa&s;|&s;ions, the dupe of her &s;en&s;es! When pride and revenge &s;peak in her brea&s;t, &s;he defies ob&s;tacles, and laughs at crimes! A&s;&s;ail but her &s;en&s;es, let mu&s;ic, for in&s;tance, touch the feeble chord of her heart, and echo to her fancy, and lo! all her perceptions change:&mdash;&s;he &s;hrinks from an act &s;he had but an in&s;tant before be|lieved meritorious, yields to &s;ome new emotion, and &s;inks&mdash;the victim of a &s;ound! O, weak and contemp|tible being!"</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a, at lea&s;t &s;eemed to ju&s;tify his ob&s;er|vations. The de&s;perate pa&s;&s;ions, which had re&s;i&s;ted every remon&s;trance of rea&s;on and humanity, were van|qui&s;hed only by other pa&s;&s;ions; and her &s;en&s;es touched by the mournful melody of mu&s;ic, and her &s;uper&s;titious fears awakened by the occurrence of a requiem for the dead, at the very moment when &s;he was planning murder, &s;he yielded, for a while, to the united influence of pity and terror. Her agitation did not &s;ub&s;ide; but &s;he returned to the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"We will conver&s;e on this bu&s;ine&s;s at &s;ome future

time." &s;aid &s;he; "at pre&s;ent, my &s;pirits are di&s;order|ed. Good night, father! Remember me in your o|ri&s;ons."</P>
<P>"Peace, be with you, Lady!" &s;aid the confe&s;&s;or, bowing gravely. "You &s;hall not be forgotten. Be re&s;olute, and your&s;elf."</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a beckoned her woman to approach, when, drawing her veil clo&s;er and, leaning upon the attendant's arm, &s;he left the cloi&s;ter, Schedoni re|mained for a moment on the &s;pot, looking after her, till her figure was lo&s;t in the gloom of the long per|&s;pective; he then with thoughtful &s;teps, quitted the cloi&s;ter by another door. He was di&s;appointed, but he did not di&s;pair.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHILE the Marche&s;a and the monk were thus meditating con&s;piraces again&s;t Ellena, &s;he was &s;till in the Ur&s;aline convent on the lake of Celano. In this ob&s;cure &s;anctuary, indi&s;po&s;ition, the con&s;equence of the long and &s;evere anxiety &s;he had &s;uffered, compelled her to remain. A fever was on her &s;pirits, and an univer&s;al la&s;&s;itude prevailed over her frame; which became the more effectual, from her very &s;olicitude to conquer it. Every approaching day &s;he hoped &s;he &s;hould be able to pur&s;ue her journey homeward, yet eve|ry day found her as incapable of traveling as the la&s;t, and the &s;econd week was already gone, before the fine air of Celano, and the tranquility of her a&s;ylum, be|gan to revive her. Vivaldi who was her daily vi&s;i|tor at the grate of the convent, and who, watching, o|ver her with inten&s;e &s;olicitude, had hitherto forborne to renew a &s;ubject, which, by agitating her &s;pirits, might affect her health, now, that her health &s;trength|ened, ventured gradually to mention his fears le&s;t the place of her retreat &s;hould be di&s;covered, and le&s;t he yet might irrecoverably lo&s;e her, unle&s;s &s;he would ap|prove of their &s;peedy marriage. At every vi&s;it he now urged the &s;ubject, repre&s;ented the dangers that &s;ur|rounded
<PB N="255" REF="032735_0253_0FF495C5DC0A8338">
them; and repeated his arguments and in|treaties; for now, when he believed that time was pre&s;&s;ing forward fatal evils, he could no longer attend to the delicate &s;cruples, that bade him be &s;paring in intreaty. Ellena, had &s;he obeyed the dictates of her heart, would have rewarded his attachment and his &s;er|vices by a frank approbation of his propo&s;al; but the objections which rea&s;on exhibited again&s;t &s;uch a conce&s;&s;ion, &s;he could neither overcome or di&s;regard.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, after he had again repre&s;ented their pre&s;ent dangers, and claimed the promi&s;e of her hand, received in the pre&s;ence of her decea&s;ed relative, Signora Bi|anchi, gently ventured to remind her, that an event as &s;udden as lamentable, had fir&s;t deferred their nuptials, and that if Bianchi had lived, Ellena would have be|&s;towed, long &s;ince, the vows he now &s;olicited. Again he intreated her, by every &s;acred and tender recollec|tion, to conclude the fearful uncertainty of their fate, and to be&s;tow upon him the right to protect her, be|fore they ventured forth from this temporary a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>Ellena immediately admitted the &s;acredne&s;s of the promi&s;e, which &s;he had formerly given, and a&s;&s;ured Vivaldi that &s;he con&s;idered her&s;elf as indi&s;&s;olubly bound to wed him as if it had been given at the altar; but &s;he objected to a confirmation of it, till his family &s;hould &s;eem willing to receive her for their daughter; when forgetting the injuries &s;he had received from them, &s;he would no longer refu&s;e their alliance. She added, that Vivaldi ought to be more jealous of the dignity of the woman, whom he honoured with his e&s;|teem, than to permit her making a greater conce&s;|&s;ion..</P>
<P>Vivaldi felt the full force of this appeal; he recol|lected, with angui&s;h, circum&s;tances of which &s;he was happily ignorant, but which &s;erved to &s;trengthen with him the ju&s;tne&s;s of her reproof. And, as the a&s;per&s;i|ons which the Marche&s;a had thrown upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">,
<PB N="256" REF="032735_0254_0FF4957D37FBD538">
crowed to his memory, pride and indignation &s;welled his heart, and &s;o far overcame apprehen&s;ion of hazard, that he formed a momentary re&s;olution to abandon e|very other con&s;ideration, to that of a&s;&s;erting the re&s;|pect which was due to Ellena, and to forbear claim|ing her for his wife, till his family &s;hould make an acknowledgment of their error, and willingly admit her in the rank of their child. But this re&s;olution was as tran&s;ient as plau&s;ible; other con&s;iderations, and former fears pre&s;&s;ed upon him. He perceived the &s;trong improbability, that they would ever make a voluntary &s;acrifice of their pride to his love; or yield mi&s;takes, nurtured by prejudice, and by willing indulgence, to truth and a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice. In the mean time, the plans, which would be formed for &s;e|parating him from Ellena, might &s;ucceed, and he &s;hould lo&s;e her for ever. Above all, it appeared, that the be&s;t, the only method, which remained for confut|ing the daring a&s;per&s;ions that had affected her name, was, by proving the high re&s;pect he him&s;elf felt for her, and pre&s;enting her to the world in the &s;acred cha|racter of his wife. The&s;e con&s;iderations quickly de|termined him to per&s;evere in his &s;uit; but it was im|po&s;&s;ible to urge them to Ellena, &s;ince the circum&s;tan|ces they mu&s;t unfold, would not only &s;hock her deli|cacy and afflict her heart, but would furni&s;h the pro|per pride &s;he cheri&s;hed with new arguments again&s;t approaching a family, who had thus gro&s;sly in&s;ulted her.</P>
<P>While the&s;e con&s;iderations occupied him, the emo|tion they occa&s;ioned did not e&s;cape Ellena's ob&s;erva|tion; it increa&s;ed, as he reflected on the impo&s;&s;ibility of urging them to her, and on the hopele&s;sne&s;s of pre|vailing with her, unle&s;s he could produce new argu|ments in his favour. His unaffected di&s;tre&s;s awaken|ed all her tenderne&s;s and gratitude; &s;he a&s;ked her&s;elf whether &s;he ought any longer to a&s;&s;ert her own rights,
<PB N="257" REF="032735_0255_0FF495C84E5098B8">
when by doing &s;o, &s;he &s;acrificed the peace of him, who had incurred &s;o much danger for her &s;ake, who had re&s;cued her from &s;evere oppre&s;&s;ion, and had &s;o long and &s;o well proved the &s;trength of his affection.</P>
<P>As &s;he applied the&s;e que&s;tions, &s;he appeared to her|&s;elf an unju&s;t and &s;elfi&s;h being, unwilling to make any &s;acrifice for the tranquility of him, who had given her liberty, even at the ri&s;k of his life. Her very vir|tues, now that they were carried to exce&s;s, &s;eemed to her to border on vices; her &s;en&s;e of dignity appeared, to be narrow pride; her delicacy weakne&s;s; her mo|derated affection cold ingratitude; and her circum|&s;pection, little le&s;s than prudence degenerated into meanne&s;s.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, as apt in admitting hope as fear, immedi|ately perceived her re&s;olution beginning to yield, and he urged again every argument which was likely to prevail over it. But the &s;ubject was too important for Ellena, to be immediately decided upon; he depart|ed with a faint a&s;&s;urance of encouragement; and &s;he forbade him to return till the following day, when &s;he would acquaint him with her final determination.</P>
<P>This interval was, perhaps, the mo&s;t painful he had ever experienced. Alone, and on the banks of the lake, he pa&s;&s;ed many hours in alternate hope and fear; in endeavouring to anticipate the deci&s;ion, on which &s;eemed &s;u&s;pended all his future peace, and abruptly recoiling from it, as often as imagination repre&s;ented it to be adver&s;e.</P>
<P>Of the walls, that enclo&s;ed her he &s;carcely ever lo&s;t &s;ight; the view of them &s;eemed to cheri&s;h his hopes, and, while he gazed upon their rugged &s;urface, Elle|na alone was pictured on his fancy; till his anxiety to learn her di&s;po&s;ition towards him aro&s;e to agony, and he would abruptly leave the &s;pot. But an invi&s;ible &s;pell &s;till &s;eemed to attract him back again, and even|ing
<PB N="258" REF="032735_0256_0FF49587F2D57938">
found him pacing &s;lowly beneath the &s;hade of tho&s;e melancholy boundaries that concealed his Ellena.</P>
<P>Her day was not more tranquil. Whenever pru|dence and decorous pride forbade her to become a member of the Vivaldi family, as con&s;tantly did gra|titude, affection, irre&s;i&s;tible tenderne&s;s plead the cau&s;e of Vivaldi. The memory of pa&s;t times returned; and the very accents of the decea&s;ed &s;eemed to murmur from the grave, and command her to fulfil the engage|ment, which had &s;oothed the dying moments of Bi|anchi.</P>
<P>On the following morning, Vivaldi was at the gates of the convent, long before the appointed hour, and he lingered in dreadful impatience, till the clock &s;truck the &s;ignal for his entrance.</P>
<P>Ellena was already in the parlour; &s;he was alone, and ro&s;e in di&s;order on his approach. His &s;teps faul|tered, his voice was lo&s;t, and his eyes only, which he fixed with a wild earne&s;tne&s;s on her's, had power to inquire her re&s;olution. She ob&s;erved the palene&s;s of his countenance, and his emotion, with a mixture of concern and approbation. At that moment, he per|ceived her &s;mile, and hold out her hand to him; and fear, care, and doubt vani&s;hed at once from his mind. He was incapable of thanking her, but &s;ighed deeply as he pre&s;&s;ed her hand, and, overcome with joy, &s;up|ported him&s;elf again&s;t the grate that &s;eparated them.</P>
<P>"You are, then, indeed my own!" &s;aid Vivaldi, at length recovering his voice&mdash;"We &s;hall be no more parted&mdash;you are mine for ever! But your countenance changes! O heaven! &s;urely I have not mi&s;taken! Speak! I conjure you, Ellena; relieve me from the&s;e terrible doubts!"</P>
<P>"I am yours, Vivaldi," replied Ellena faintly, "op|pre&s;&s;ion can part us no more."</P>
<P>She wept, and drew her veil over her eyes,</P>
<P>"What mean tho&s;e tears?" &s;aid Vivaldi, with a|larm.
<PB N="259" REF="032735_0257_0FF495D1CD93B158">
"Ah! Ellena," he added in a &s;oftened voice, "&s;hould tears mingle with &s;uch moments as the&s;e! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould your tears fall upon my heart now! They tell me, that your con&s;ent is given with reluctance&mdash;with grief; that your love is feeble, your heart&mdash;yes Elle|na! that your whole heart is no longer mine!"</P>
<P>"They ought rather to tell you," replied Ellena, "that it is all your own; that my affection never was more powerful than now, when it can overcome every con&s;ideration with re&s;pect to your family, and urge me to a &s;tep which mu&s;t degrade me in their eyes.&mdash;and, I fear, in my own,"</P>
<P>"O retract that cruel a&s;&s;ertion!" interrupted Vi|valdi, "Degrade you in your own!&mdash;degrade you in their eyes!" He was much agitated; his countenance was flu&s;hed, and air of more than u&s;ual dignity dilat|ed his figure,</P>
<P>"The time &s;hall come, my Ellena." he added with energy, "when they &s;hall under&s;tand your worth, and acknowledge your excellence. O! that I were an Emperor, that I might &s;hew to all the world how much I love and honour you!"</P>
<P>Ellena gave him her hand, and, withdrawing her veil, &s;miled on him through her tears, with gratitude and reviving courage.</P>
<P>Before Vivaldi retired to the convent, he obtained her con&s;ent to con&s;ult with an aged Benedictine, whom he had engaged in his intere&s;t, as to the hour in which the marriage might be &s;olemnized with lea&s;t ob&s;ervation. The prie&s;t informed him, that at the conclu&s;ion of the ve&s;per-&s;ervice, he &s;hould be di&s;en|gaged for &s;everal hours; and that, as the fir&s;t hour after &s;un-&s;et was more &s;olitary than any other, the brotherhood being then a&s;&s;embled in the refactory, he would meet Vivaldi and Ellena at that time, in a chapel on the edge of the lake, a &s;hort di&s;tance from
<PB N="260" REF="032735_0258_0FF585131E8172C0">
the Benedictiue convent, to which it belonged, and celebrate their nuptials.</P>
<P>With this propo&s;al, Vivaldi immediately returned to Ellena; when it was agreed that the party &s;hould a&s;&s;emble by the hour mentioned by the prie&s;t. Elle|na, who had thought it proper to mention her inten|tion to the Abbe&s;s of the Ur&s;alines, was, by her par|mi&s;&s;ion, to be attended by a lay-&s;i&s;ter; and Vivaldi was to meet her without the walls, and conduct her to the altar. When the ceremony was over, the fuji|tives were to embark in a ve&s;&s;el, hired for the purpo&s;e, and cro&s;&s;ing the lake, proceed towards Naples. Vi|valdi again withdrew to engage a boat, and Ellena to prepare for the continuance of her journey.</P>
<P>As the appointed hour drew near, her &s;pirits &s;unk, and &s;he watched with melancholy foreboding, the &s;un retiring amid&s;t &s;tormy clouds, and his rays fading from the highe&s;t points of the mountains, till the gloom of twilight prevailed over the &s;cene. She then left her apartment, took a grateful leave of the ho&s;pitable Ab|be&s;s, and, attended by the lay-&s;i&s;ter, quitted the con|vent.</P>
<P>Immediately without the gate &s;he was met by Vi|valdi, who&s;e looks, as he put her arm within his, gent|ly reproached her for the dejection of her air.</P>
<P>They walked in &s;ilence towards the chapel of San Seba&s;tian. The &s;cene appeared to &s;ympathize with the &s;pirits of Ellena. It was a gloomy evening, and the lake, which broke in dark waves upon the &s;hore, mingled its hollow &s;ounds with tho&s;e of the wind, that bowed the lofty pines, and &s;wept in gu&s;ts among the rocks. She ob&s;erved with alarm the heavy thunder clouds, that rolled along the &s;ides of the mountains and the birds circling &s;wiftly over the waters, and &s;cudding away to their ne&s;ts among the cliffs; and &s;he noticed to Vivaldi, that, as a &s;torm &s;eemed approaching, &s;he wi&s;hed to avoid cro&s;&s;ing the lake. He immediately
<PB N="261" REF="032735_0259_0FF495D4DD4871D8">
ordered Paulo to di&s;mi&s;s the boat, and to be in waiting with a carriage, that, if the weather &s;hould become clear, they might not be detained longer than was o|therwi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>As they approached the chapel, Ellena fixed her eyes on the mournful cypre&s;&s;es which waved over it, and &s;ighed. "Tho&s;e," &s;he &s;aid, "are funeral mementos&mdash;not &s;uch as &s;hould grace the altar of marriage! Vi|valdi, I could be &s;uper&s;titious.&mdash;Think you not they are portentous of future misfortune? But forgive me my &s;pirits are weak,"</P>
<P>Vivaldi endeavoured to &s;oothe her mind, and tender|ly reproached her for the &s;adne&s;s &s;he indulged. Thus they entered the chapel. Silence, and a kind of gloo|my &s;epulchral light prevailed within. The venerable Benedictine, with a brother, who was to &s;erve as guardian to the bride, were already there, but they were kneeling, and engaged in prayer.</P>
<P>Vivaldi led the trembling Ellena to the altar, where they waited till the Benedictines &s;hould have fini&s;hed, and the&s;e were moments of great emotion. She often looked round the du&s;ky chapel, in fearful expectation of di&s;covering &s;ome lurking ob&s;erver; and though &s;he knew it to be very improbable, that any per&s;on in this neighbourhood could be intere&s;ted in interrupting the ceremony, her mind involuntarily admitted the po&s;|&s;ibility of it. Once, indeed, as her eyes glanced over a ca&s;ement, Ellena fancied &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed a hu|man face laid clo&s;e to the gla&s;s, as if to watch what was pa&s;&s;ing within; but when &s;he looked again, the apparition was gone. Notwith&s;tanding this, &s;he li&s;t|ened with anxiety to the uncertain &s;ounds without, and &s;ometimes &s;tarted as the &s;urges of the lake da&s;hed over the rock below, almo&s;t believing &s;he heard the &s;teps and whi&s;pering voices of men in the avenues of the chapel. She tried, however, to &s;ubdue apprehen&s;ion, by con&s;idering, that if this were true, an harmle&s;s cu|rio&s;ity
<PB N="262" REF="032735_0260_0FF46EAFE9C4B020">
might have attracted &s;ome inhabitants of the convent hither, and her &s;pirits became more compo&s;|ed, till &s;he ob&s;erved a door open a little way, and a dark countenance looking from behind it. In the next in&s;tant it retreated, and the door was clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who perceived Ellena's complexion change, as &s;he laid her hand on his arm, followed her eyes to the door, but no per&s;on appearing, he enquired the cau&s;e of her alarm.</P>
<P>"We are ob&s;erved," &s;aid Ellena, "&s;ome per&s;on ap|peared at that door!"</P>
<P>"And if we are ob&s;erved, my love," replied Vival|di, "who is there in this neighbourhood who&s;e ob&s;er|vation we can have rea&s;on to fear? Good father, di&s;|patch," he added, turning to the prie&s;t, "you forget that we are waiting."</P>
<P>The officiating prie&s;t made a &s;ignal that he had nearly concluded his ori&s;on; but the other brother ro&s;e immediately, and &s;poke with Vivaldi, who de&s;ired that the doors of the chapel might be fa&s;tened to prevent intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>"We dare not bar the gates of this holy temple," replied the Benedictine, "it is a &s;anctuary, and never may be clo&s;ed."</P>
<P>"But you will allow me to repre&s;s idle curio&s;ity," &s;aid Vivaldi, "and to enquire who watches beyond that door? The tranquility of this lady demands thus much."</P>
<P>The brother a&s;&s;ented, and Vivaldi &s;tepped to the door; but perceiving no per&s;on in the ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;age beyond, it, he returned with lighter &s;teps to the altar, from which the officiating prie&s;t now ro&s;e.</P>
<P>"My children," &s;aid he, "I have made you wait,&mdash;but an old man's prayers are not le&s;s important than a young man's vows, though this is not a moment when you will admit that truth."</P>
<P>"I will allow whatever you plea&s;e, good father."
<PB N="263" REF="032735_0261_0FF495D353875FD8">
replied Vivaldi, "if you will admini&s;ter tho&s;e vows, without further delay;&mdash;time pre&s;&s;es."</P>
<P>The venerable prie&s;t took his &s;tation at the altar, and opened the book. Vivaldi placed him&s;elf on his right hand, and with looks of anxious love, endeavour|ed to encourage Ellena, who with a dejected counte|nance, which her veil but ill concealed, and eyes fixed on the ground, learned on her attendant &s;i&s;ter. The figure and homely features of this &s;i&s;ter; the tall &s;ta|ture and har&s;h vi&s;age of the brother, clothed in the grey habit of his order; the &s;ilvered head and placid phy|&s;iognomy of the officiating prie&s;t, enlighted by a gleam from the lamp above, oppo&s;ed to the youthful grace and &s;pirit of Vivaldi, and the milder beauty and &s;weet|ne&s;s of Ellena, formed altogether a group worthy of the pencil.</P>
<P>The prie&s;t had begun the ceremony, when a noi&s;e from without again alarmed Ellena, who ob&s;erved the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> once cautiou&s;ly opened, and a man bend forward his gigantic figure from behind it. He carried a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orch, and its glare, as the door gradually enclo&s;ed, di&s;|covered other per&s;ons in the pa&s;&s;age beyond, looking forward over his &s;houlder into the chapel. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> of their dre&s;s in&s;tantly convinced Ellena that they were not inhabitants of the Benedictine convent, but &s;ome terrible me&s;&s;engers of evil. Her half-&s;tifled &s;hriek alarmed Vivaldi, who caught her before &s;he fell to the ground: but, as he had not faced the door, he did not under&s;tand the occa&s;ion of her terror, till the &s;udden ru&s;h of foot&s;teps made him turn, when he ob&s;er|ved &s;everal men armed, and very &s;ingularly habited, advancing towards the altar.</P>
<P>"Who is he that intrudes upon this &s;anctuary?" he demanded &s;ternly, while he half ro&s;e from the ground where Ellena had &s;unk.</P>
<P>"What &s;acrilegious foot&s;teps," cried the prie&s;t, "thus rudely violate this holy place?"</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="032735_0262_0FF49589785B98D8">
Ellena was now in&s;en&s;ible; and the men continuing to advance, Vivaldi drew his &s;word to protect her.</P>
<P>The prie&s;t and Vivaldi now &s;poke together, but the words of neither could be di&s;tingui&s;hed, when a voice, tremendous from his loudne&s;s, like bur&s;ting thunder, di&s;&s;ipated the cloud of my&s;tery."</P>
<P>"You Vincentio di Vivaldi, and of Naples." it &s;aid, "and you Ellena di Ro&s;alba, of the Villa Altieri, we &s;ummon you to &s;urrender, in the name of the mo&s;t holy Inqui&s;ition!"</P>
<P>"The Inqui&s;ition!" exclaimed Vivaldi, &s;carcely believing what he heard. "Here is &s;ome mi&s;take!"</P>
<P>The official repeated the &s;ummons, without deign|ing to reply.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, yet more a&s;toni&s;hed, added, "Do not ima|gine you can &s;o far impo&s;e upon my credulity, as that I can believe my&s;elf to have fallen within the cogni|zance of the Inqui&s;ition."</P>
<P>"You may believe what you plea&s;e, Signor," re|plied the chief Officer, "but you and that lady are our pri&s;oners."</P>
<P>"Begone, impo&s;tor!" &s;aid Vivaldi, &s;pringing from the ground, where he had &s;upported Ellena, or my &s;word &s;hall teach you to repent your audacity!"</P>
<P>"Do you in&s;ult an officer of the inqui&s;ition!" ex|claimed the ruffian. "That holy Community will in|form you what you incur by re&s;i&s;ting its mandate."</P>
<P>The prie&s;t interrupted Vivaldi's retort. "If you are really officers of that tremendous tribunal," he &s;aid, "produce &s;ome proof of your office. Remem|ber this place is &s;anctified, and tremble for the con&s;e|quence of impo&s;ition. You do wrong to believe, that will deliver up to you per&s;ons who have taken refuge here, without an unequivocal demand from that dread power."</P>
<P>"Produce your form of &s;ummons," demanded Vi|valdi, with haughty impatience.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="032735_0263_0FF495D663047E28">
"It is here," replied the official, drawing forth a black &s;croll, which he delivered to the prie&s;t, "Read and be &s;atisfied!"</P>
<P>The Benedictine &s;tarted the in&s;tant he beheld the &s;croll, but he received and deliberately examined it. The kind of parchment, the impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;eal, the particular form of words, the private &s;ignals, under|&s;tood only by the initiated&mdash;all announced this to be a true in&s;trument of arre&s;tation from the <HI>Holy Office.</HI> The &s;croll dropped from his hand, and he fixed his eyes, with &s;urprize and unalterable compa&s;&s;ion, upon Vivaldi, who &s;topped to reach the parchment, when it was &s;natched by the official.</P>
<P>"Unhappy young man!" &s;aid the prie&s;t, "it is too true; you are &s;ummoned by that awful power, to an|&s;wer to your crime, and I am &s;pared from the commi&s;|&s;ion of a terrible offence!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi appeared thunder&s;truck. "For what crime, holy father, am I called upon to an&s;wer? This is &s;ome bold and artful impo&s;ture, &s;ince it can delude even you? What crime&mdash;what offence?"</P>
<P>"I did not think you had been thus hardened in guilt!" replied the prie&s;t. "Forbear! add not the audacity of fal&s;ehood to the headlong pa&s;&s;ions of youth. You under&s;tand too well your crime."</P>
<P>"Fal&s;ehood!" retorted Vivaldi, "But your years, old man, and tho&s;e &s;acred ve&s;tments, protect you. For the&s;e ruffians, who have dared to implicate that inno|cent victim," pointing to Ellena, "in the charge, they &s;hall have ju&s;tice from my vengeance."</P>
<P>"Forbear! forbear?" &s;aid the prie&s;t, &s;eizing his arm, "have pity on your&s;elf and on her. Know you not the puni&s;hment you in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ur from re&s;i&s;tance!"</P>
<P>"I know not, nor care," replied Vivaldi, "but I will defend Ellena di Ro&s;alba to the la&s;t moment. Let them reproach if they dare."</P>
<P>"It is on her, on her who lies &s;en&s;ele&s;s at your
<PB N="266" REF="032735_0264_0FF4958B03657220">
feet," &s;aid the prie&s;t, "that they will wreak their ven|geance for the&s;e in&s;ults; on her&mdash;the partner of your guilt."</P>
<P>"The partner of my guilt!" exclaimed Vivaldi, with mingled a&s;toni&s;hment and indignation&mdash;"of my guilt."</P>
<P>"Ra&s;h young man! does not the very veil &s;he wears betray it? I marvel how it could pa&s;s my ob|&s;ervation!"</P>
<P>"You have &s;tolen a nun from her convent," &s;aid the chief officer, "and mu&s;t an&s;wer for the crime. When you have wearied your&s;elf with the&s;e heroics, Signor, you mu&s;t go with us; our patience is wearied already."</P>
<P>Vivaldi ob&s;erved, for the fir&s;t time, that Ellena was &s;hrouded in a nun's veil; it was the one which Olivia had lent, to conceal her from the notice of the Abbe&s;s, on the night of her departure from San Stefano, and which, in the hurry of that departure, &s;he had forgot|ten to leave with the nun. During this interval, her mind had been too entirely occupied by cares and ap|prehen&s;ion to allow her once to notice, that the veil &s;he wore was other than her u&s;ual one; but it had been too well ob&s;erved by &s;ome of the Ur&s;aline &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>Though he knew not how to account for the cir|cum&s;tance of the veil, Vivaldi began to perceive others which gave colour to the charge brought again&s;t him, and to a&s;certain the wide circumference of the &s;nare that was &s;pread around him. He fancied, too, that he perceived the hand of Schedoni employed upon it, and that his dark &s;pirit was now avenging it&s;elf for the expo&s;ure he had &s;uffered in the church of the Spirito Santo, and for all the con&s;equent mortifications. As Vivaldi was ignorant of the ambitious hopes which the Marche&s;a had encouraged in father Schedoni, he did not &s;ee the improbability, that the Confe&s;&s;or would have dared to hazard her favour by this arre&s;t of her
<PB N="267" REF="032735_0265_0FF495E0D90194B0">
&s;on; much le&s;s could he &s;u&s;pect, that Schedoni, hav|ing done &s;o, had &s;ecrets in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which en|abled him &s;afely to defy her re&s;entment, and bind her in &s;ilence to his decree.</P>
<P>With the conviction, that Schedoni was the ma|&s;ter-hand that directed the pre&s;ent manoeuvre, Vival|di &s;tood agha&s;t, gazing in &s;ilent unutterable angui&s;h on Ellena, who, as &s;he began to revive, &s;tretched forth her helple&s;s hands, and called upon him to &s;ave her, "Do not leave me," &s;aid &s;he in accents the mo&s;t &s;up|plicating, "I am &s;afe while you are with me."</P>
<P>At the &s;ound of her voice, he &s;tarted from his trance, and turning fiercely on the ruffians, who &s;tood in &s;ul|len watchfulne&s;s around, bade them depart, or prepare for his fury. At the &s;ame in&s;tant they all drew their &s;words, and the &s;hrieks of Ellena, and the &s;upplications of the officiating prie&s;t, were lo&s;t amid&s;t the tumult of the combatants.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, mo&s;t unwilling to &s;hed blood, &s;tood, mere|ly on the defen&s;ive, till the violence of his antagoni&s;ts compelled him to exert all his &s;kill and &s;trength. He then di&s;abled one of the ruffians; but his &s;kill was in&s;ufficient to repel the other two, and he was nearly overcome, when &s;teps were heard approaching, and Paulo ru&s;hed into the chapel. Perceiving his ma&s;ter be&s;et, he drew his &s;word, and came furiou&s;ly to his aid. He fought with unconquerable audacity and fiercene&s;s, till nearly at the moment when his adver&s;ary fell, other ruffians entered the chapel, and Vivaldi with his faith|ful &s;ervant was wounded, and, at length di&s;armed.</P>
<P>Ellena, who had been withheld from throwing her|&s;elf between the combatants, now, on ob&s;erving that Vivaldi was wounded, renewed her efforts for liberty, accompanied by &s;uch agony of &s;upplication and com|plaint, as almo&s;t moved to pity the hearts of the &s;ur|rounding ruffians.</P>
<P>Di&s;abled by his wounds, and al&s;o held by his enemies,
<PB N="268" REF="032735_0266_0FF4959577A748B0">
Vivaldi was compelled to witne&s;s her di&s;tre&s;s and dan|ger, without a hope of re&s;cuing her. In frantic ac|cents he called upon the old prie&s;t to protect her.</P>
<P>"I dare not oppo&s;e the orders of the Inqui&s;ition," replied the Benedictine, "even if I had &s;ufficient &s;trength to defy its officials. Know you not, unhap|py young man, that it is death to re&s;i&s;t them?"</P>
<P>"Death!" exclaimed Ellena, "death!"</P>
<P>"Ay lady, too &s;urely &s;o?"</P>
<P>"Signor, it would have been well for you," &s;aid one of the officers, "if you had taken my advice: you will pay dearly for what you have done," pointing to the ruffian who lay &s;everely wounded on the ground.</P>
<P>"My ma&s;ter will not have that to pay for, friend," &s;aid Paulo, "for if you mu&s;t know, that is a piece of my work; and, if my arms were now at liberty, I would try if I could not match it among one of you, though I am &s;o fla&s;hed,"</P>
<P>"Peace, good Paulo! the deed was mine," &s;aid Vi|valdi; then addre&s;&s;ing the official, "For my&s;elf I care not, I have done my duty&mdash;but for her!&mdash;Can you, look upon her, innocent and helple&s;s as &s;he is, and not relent! Can you, will you, barbarains! drag her, al|&s;o to de&s;truction upon a charge too &s;o daringly fal&s;e?"</P>
<P>"Our relenting would be of no &s;ervice to her," re|plied the official, we mu&s;t do our duty. Whether the charge is true or fal&s;e, &s;he mu&s;t an&s;wer to it before her judges."</P>
<P>"What charge demanded Ellena.</P>
<P>"The charge of having broken your nun's vows." replied the prie&s;t.</P>
<P>Ellena rai&s;ed her eyes to heaven; "Is it even &s;o!" &s;he exclaimed.</P>
<P>"You hear &s;he acknowledges the crime," &s;aid one of the ruffians.</P>
<P>"She acknowledges no crime," replied Vivaldi; "&s;he only perceives the extent of the malice that per|&s;ecutes
<PB N="269" REF="032735_0267_0FF495E262C0BE68">
her. O! Ellena mu&s;t, I then abandon you to their power! leave you for ever!"</P>
<P>The agony of this thought re-animated him with momentary &s;trength; he bur&s;t from the gra&s;p of the officials, and once more cla&s;ped Ellena to his bo&s;om, who, unable to &s;peak, wept, with the angui&s;h of a breaking heart, as her head &s;unk upon his &s;houlder. The ruffians around them &s;o far re&s;pected their grief, that, for a moment, they did not interrupt it.</P>
<P>Vivaldi's exertion was tran&s;ient; faint from &s;or|row, and from lo&s;s of blood, he became unable to &s;up|port him&s;elf, and was compelled again to relinqui&s;h Ellena.</P>
<P>"Is there no help?" &s;aid &s;he, with agony; "will you &s;uffer him to expire on the ground?"</P>
<P>The prie&s;t directed, that he &s;hould be conveyed to the Benedictine convent, where his wounds might be examined, and medical aid admini&s;tered. The di&s;|abled ruffians were already carried thither; but Vival|di refu&s;ed to go, unle&s;s Ellena might accompany him. It was contrary to the rules of the place, that a wo|man &s;hould enter it, and before the prie&s;t could reply, his Benedictine brother eagerly &s;aid that they dared not tran&s;gre&s;s the law of the convent.</P>
<P>Ellena's fears for Vivaldi entirely overcame tho&s;e for her&s;elf, and &s;he entreated, that he would &s;uffer him|&s;elf to be conveyed to the Benedictines; but he could not be prevailed with to leave her. The officials, however, prepared to &s;eparate them; Vivaldi in vain urged the u&s;ele&s;s cruelty of dividing him from Ellena, if, as they had hinted, &s;he al&s;o was to be carried to the Inqui&s;ition; and as ineffectually demanded, whither they really de&s;igned to take her.</P>
<P>"We &s;hall take good care of her, Signor," &s;aid an officer, "that is &s;ufficient for you, It &s;ignifies no|thing whether you are going the &s;ame way, you mu&s;t not go together."</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="032735_0268_0FF4959704D7FD80">
"Why, did you ever hear, Signor, of arre&s;ted per|&s;ons being &s;uffered to remain in company?', &s;aid ano|ther ruffian, "Fine plots they would lay; I warrant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hey would not contradict each other's evidence a ti|tle."</P>
<P>"You &s;hall not &s;eperate me from my ma&s;ter though," vociferated Paulo; "I demand to be &s;ent to the In|qui&s;ition with him, or to the devil, but all is one for that."</P>
<P>"Fair and &s;oftly," replied the officer; "you &s;hall be &s;ent to the Inqui&s;ition fir&s;t, and to the devil after|wards; you mu&s;t be tried before you are condemned.'</P>
<P>"But wa&s;te no more time," he added to his fol|lowers, and pointing to Ellena, "away with her."</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this they lifted Ellena in their arms.&mdash;"Let me loo&s;e!" cried Paulo, when he &s;aw they were carrying her from the place, "let me loo&s;e, I &s;ay!" and the violence of his &s;truggles bur&s;t a&s;under the cords which held him; a vain relea&s;e, for he was in&s;tantly &s;eized again.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, already exhau&s;ted by the lo&s;s of blood and the angui&s;h of his mind, made however, a la&s;t effort to &s;ave her; he tried to rai&s;e him&s;elf from the ground, hut a &s;udden film came over his &s;ight, and his &s;en&s;es for&s;ook him, while yet the name of Ellena faultered on his lips,</P>
<P>As they bore her from the chapel, &s;he continued to call upon Vivaldi, and alternately to &s;upplicate that &s;he might once more behold him, and take one la&s;t adieu. The ruffians were inexorable and &s;he heard his voice no more, for he no longer heard&mdash;no longer was able to reply to her's.</P>
<P>"O! once again!" &s;he cried in agony, "One word, Vivaldi! Let me hear the &s;ound of your voice yet once again!" But it was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>As &s;he quitted the chapel, with eyes &s;till bent to|wards the &s;pot where he lay, &s;he exclaimed in the
<PB N="271" REF="032735_0269_0FF495E3E9FE80E8">
piercing accents of de&s;pair, "Farewel, Vivaldi!&mdash;O! for ever&mdash;ever, farewel!"</P>
<P>The tone, in which &s;he pronounced the la&s;t "fare|wel!" was &s;o touching, that even the cold heart of the prie&s;t could not re&s;i&s;t it; but he impatiently wiped away the few tears, that ru&s;hed into his eyes, before they were ob&s;erved. Vivaldi heard i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;it &s;eemed to arou&s;e him from death!&mdash;he heard her mournful voice for the la&s;t time, and turning his eyes, &s;aw her veil floating away through the portal of the chapel. All &s;uffering, all efforts, all re&s;i&s;tance were vain; the ruffians bound him bleeding as he was, and conveyed him to the Benedictine convent, together with the wounded Paulo, who uncea&s;ingly vociferated on the way thither. "I demand to be &s;ent to the In|qui&s;ition!" I demand to be &s;ent to the Inqui&s;ition!"</P>

<P>THE wounds of Vivaldi, and of his &s;ervant, were pronounced by the Benedictine, who had examined and dre&s;&s;ed them, not to be dangerous, but tho&s;e of one of the ruffians were declared doubtful. Some few of the brothers di&s;played much compa&s;&s;ion and kindne&s;s towards the pri&s;oners; but the greater part &s;eemed fearful of expre&s;&s;ing any degree of &s;ympathy for pre|&s;ons who had fallen within the cognizance of the Ho|ly Office, and even kept aloof from the chamber, in which they were confined. To this &s;elf-re&s;triction, however, they were not long &s;ubjected; for Vivaldi and Paulo were compelled to begin their journey as &s;oon as &s;ome &s;hort re&s;t had &s;ufficiently revived them. They were placed in the &s;ame carriage, but the pre|&s;ence of two officers prevented all interchange of con|jecture as to the de&s;tination of Ellena, and with re&s;|pect to the immediate occa&s;ion of their misfortune. Paulo, indeed, now and then hazarded a &s;urmi&s;e, and did not &s;cruple to affirm, that the Abbe&s;s of San Ste|fano was their chief enemy; that the Carmelite friars, who had overtaken them on the road, were her agents; and that having traced their route, they had given in|telligence where Vivaldi and Ellena might be found.</P>
<P>"I gue&s;&s;ed we never &s;hould e&s;cape the Abbe&s;s," &s;aid Paulo, "though I would not di&s;turb you Signor Mio, nor the poor lady Ellena, by &s;aying &s;o. But your Abbe&s;&s;e&s;s are as cunning as Inqui&s;itors, and are
<PB N="273" REF="032735_0271_0FF495E570D7BD08">
&s;o fond of governing that they had rather, like them, &s;end a man to the devil, than &s;end him no where.</P>
<P>Vivaldi gave Paulo a &s;ignificant look, which was meant to repre&s;s his imprudent loquacity, and then &s;unk again into &s;ilence and the ab&s;tractions of deep grief. The officers, mean while, never &s;poke, but were ob&s;ervant of all that Paulo &s;aid, who perceived their watchfulne&s;s, but becau&s;e he de&s;pi&s;ed them as &s;pies, he thoughtle&s;sly de&s;pi&s;ed them al&s;o as enemies, and was &s;o far from concealing opinions, which they might repeat to his prejudice, that he had a pride in exaggerating them, and in daring the wor&s;t, which the exa&s;perated tempers of the&s;e men, &s;hut up in the &s;ame carriage with him, and compelled to hear what|ever he cho&s;e to &s;ay again&s;t the in&s;titution to which they belonged, could effect. Whenever Vivaldi, re|called from his ab&s;tractions by &s;ome bold a&s;&s;ertion, endeavoured to check his imprudence, Paulo was con|tented to &s;olace his con&s;cience, in&s;tead of protecting him&s;elf, by &s;aying, "It is their own fault; they would thru&s;t them&s;elves into my company; let them have enough of it; and if ever they take me before their reverences, the Inqui&s;itiors, <HI>they</HI> &s;hall have enough of it too. I will play up &s;uch a tune in the Inqui&s;i|tion, as is not heard there every day. I will jingle all the bells on their fool's caps, and tell them a little hone&s;t truth, if they make me &s;mart for it ever &s;o."</P>
<P>Vivaldi, arou&s;ed once more, and &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed for the con&s;equences which hone&s;t Paulo might be drawing upon him&s;elf, now in&s;i&s;ted on his &s;ilence, and was obeyed.</P>
<P>They travelled during the whole night, &s;topping only to change hor&s;es. At every po&s;t hou&s;e, Vival|di looked for a carriage that might inclo&s;e Ellena, but none appeared, nor any &s;ound of wheels told him that &s;he followed.</P>
<P>With the morning light he perceived the dome of
<PB N="274" REF="032735_0272_0FF495A5E5EB3EB0">
St. Peter appearing faintly over the plains that &s;ur|rounded Rome and he under&s;tood, for the fir&s;t time, that he was going to the pri&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition in that city. The travellers de&s;cended upon the Cam|pania, and then re&s;ted for a few hours at a &s;mall town on its borders.</P>
<P>When they again &s;et forward, Vivaldi perceived that the guard was changed, the officer who had re|mained with him in the apartment of the inn, only appearing among the new faces which &s;urrounded him, The dre&s;s and manners of the&s;e men differed con&s;id|erably from tho&s;e of the other. Their conduct was more temperate, but their countenances expre&s;&s;ed darker cruelty, mingled with a &s;ly demurene&s;s, and a &s;olemn &s;elf-importance, that announced them at once as be|longing to the Inqui&s;ition.&mdash;They were almo&s;t in|variably &s;ilent; and when they did &s;peak, it was only in a few &s;ententious words. To the abounding que&s;|tions of Paulo, and the few earne&s;t entreaties of his ma&s;ter, to be informed of the place of Ellena's de&s;ti|nation, they made not the lea&s;t reply; and li&s;tened to all the flouri&s;hing &s;peeches of the &s;ervant again&s;t In|qui&s;itors and the Holy Office with the mo&s;t profound gravity.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was &s;truck with the circum&s;tance of the guard being changed, and &s;till more with the appear|ance of the party, who now compo&s;ed it. When he compared the manners of the late, with tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent guard, he thought he di&s;covered in the fir&s;t the mere ferocity of ruffians; but in the latter, the prin|ciples of cunning and cruelty, which &s;eemed particu|larly to characterize Inqui&s;itors; he was inclined to believe, that a &s;tratagem had enthralled him, and that now, for the fir&s;t time, he was in the cu&s;tody of the <HI>Holy Office.</HI></P>
<P>It was near midnight when the pri&s;oners entered the <HI>Porto del Popolo,</HI> and found them&s;elves in the
<PB N="275" REF="032735_0273_0FF495EFC1FF9CA8">
mid&s;t of the Carnival at Rome. The <HI>Cor&s;o,</HI> through which they were obliged to pa&s;s, was crowded with gay carriages ma&s;ks, with proce&s;&s;ions of mu&s;icians, monks, and mountebanks, was lighted up with innu|merable flambeaux, and re&s;ounded with the heterogene|ous rattling of wheels, the mu&s;ic of &s;erenaders, and the jokes and laughter of the revellers, as they &s;portively threw about their &s;ugar-plumbs. The heat of the weather made it nece&s;&s;ary to have the windows of the coach open; and the pri&s;oners, therefore, &s;aw all that pa&s;&s;ed without. It was a &s;cene which contra&s;ted cru|elty with the feelings and circum&s;tances of Vivaldi; torn as he was from her he mo&s;t loved, in dreadful uncertainty as to her fate, and him&s;elf about to be brought before a tribunal, who&s;e my&s;terious and ter|rible proceedings appalled even the brave&s;t &s;pirits. Altogether, this was one of the mo&s;t &s;triking exam|ples, which the chequer-work of human life could &s;hew, or human feelings endure. Vivaldi, &s;ickened as he looked upon the &s;plendid crowd, while the car|riage made its way &s;lowly with it; but Paulo, as he gazed, was reminded of the Cor&s;o of Naples, &s;uch as it appeared at the time of Carnival, and, comparing the pre&s;ent &s;cene with his native one, he found fault with every thing he beheld. The dre&s;&s;es were ta&s;te|le&s;s, the equipages without &s;plendor, the people with|out &s;pirit; yet, &s;uch was the propen&s;ity of his heart to &s;ympatize with whatever was gay, that, for &s;ome moments, he forgot that he was a pri&s;oner on his way to the Inqui&s;ition; almo&s;t forgot that he was a Nea|politan; and while he exclaimed again&s;t the dullne&s;s of a Roman Carnival, would have &s;prung through the carriage window to partake of its &s;pirit, if his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">etters and his wounds had not withheld him. A deep &s;igh from Vivaldi recalled his wandering imagination; and when he noticed again the &s;orrow in his ma&s;ter's look, all his lightly joyous &s;pirits fled.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="032735_0274_0FF4959A1721C890">
"My <HI>mae&s;tro</HI> my dear <HI>mae&s;tro!</HI>"&mdash;he &s;aid, and knew not how to fini&s;h what he wi&s;hed to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>At that moment they pa&s;&s;ed the theatre of San Car|lo, the doors of which were thronged with equipa|ges, where Roman ladies, in their gala habits, courti|ers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n their fanta&s;tic dre&s;&s;es, and ma&s;ks of all de&s;crip|tions, were ha&s;tening to the opera. In the mid&s;t of this gay bu&s;tle, where the carriage was unable to proceed, the officials of the Inqui&s;ition looked on in &s;olemn &s;ilence, not a mu&s;cle of their features relaxing in &s;ympathy, or yielding a &s;ingle wrinkle of the &s;elf-importance that lifted their brows; and, while they regarded with &s;ecret contempt, tho&s;e who could be thus lightly plea&s;ed, the people, in return, more wi&s;e|ly, herhaps, regarded with contempt the proud mo|ro&s;ene&s;s, that refu&s;ed to partake of innocent plea&s;ures, becau&s;e they were trifling, and &s;hrunk from counte|nances furrowed with the &s;ternne&s;s of cruelty. But when their office was di&s;tingui&s;hed, part of the crowd pre&s;&s;ed back from the carriage in affright, while ano|ther part advanced with curio&s;ity; through, as the majority retreated, &s;pace was left for the carriage to move on. After quitting the Cor&s;o, it proceeded for &s;ome miles through dark and de&s;erted &s;treets, were on|ly here and there a lamp, hung on high before the image of a &s;aint, &s;hed its glimmering light, and where a melancholy and univer&s;al &s;ilence prevailed. At in|tervals, indeed, the moon, as the clouds pa&s;&s;ed away, &s;hewed, for a moment, &s;ome of tho&s;e mighty monu|ments of Rome's eternal name, tho&s;e &s;acred ruins, tho&s;e gigantic &s;keletons which once enclo&s;ed a &s;oul, who&s;e energies governed a world! Even Vivaldi could not behold with indifference the grandeur of the&s;e re|liques, as the rays fell upon the hoary walls and co|lumns, or pa&s;s among the&s;e &s;cences of ancient &s;tory, without feeling a melancholy awe, a &s;acred enthu&s;ia&s;m, that withdrew him from him&s;elf. But the illu&s;ion
<PB N="277" REF="032735_0275_0FF495F1498D7AF8">
was tran&s;ient; his own misfortunes pre&s;&s;ed too hea|vily upon him to be long unfelt, and his enthu&s;ia&s;m vani&s;hed like the moon light.</P>
<P>A returning gleam lighted up, &s;oon after, the rude and exten&s;ive area, which the carriage was cro&s;&s;ing. It appeared, from its de&s;olation, and the ruins &s;cat|tered di&s;tantly along its &s;kirts, to be a part of the city entirely abandoned by the modern inhabitants to the reliques of its former granduer. Not even the &s;ha|dow of a human being cro&s;&s;ed the wa&s;te, nor any build|ing appeared, which might be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;helter one. The deep tone of a bell, however, rolling on the &s;i|lence of the night, announced the haunts of man to be not far off; and Vivaldi perceived in the di&s;tance, to which he was approaching, an extent of lofty walls and towers, that, as far as the gloom would permit his eye to penetrate, bounded the horizon. He judged the&s;e to be the pri&s;ons of the inqui&s;ition. Paulo pointed them out at the &s;ame moment. "Ah, Signor!' &s;aid he de&s;pondingly, "that is the place! what &s;trength! If, my Lord, the Marche&s;e were but to &s;ee where we are going! Ah!"&mdash;</P>
<P>He concluded with a deep &s;igh, and &s;unk again in|to the &s;tate of apprehen&s;ion and mute expectation, which he had &s;uffered from the moment that he quit-th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cor&s;o.</P>
<P>The carriage having reached the walls, followed their bendings to a con&s;iderable extent. The&s;e walls, of immen&s;e height, and &s;trengthened by innumerable ma&s;&s;y bulwarks, exhibited neither window or grate, put a va&s;t and dreary blank; a &s;mall round tower only, perched here and there upon the &s;ummit, breaking their monotony,</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners pa&s;&s;ed what &s;eemed to be the princi|pal entrance, from the granduer of its portal, and the gigantic loftine&s;s of the towers that ro&s;e over it; and after the carriage &s;topped at an arch-way in the walls,
<PB N="278" REF="032735_0276_0FF495A76D7826E8">
&s;trongly barricadoed. One of the e&s;cort alighted, and hav|ing &s;truck upon the bars, a folding door within was immediately opened, and a man, bearing a torch ap|peared behind the barricado, who&s;e countenance, as he looked through it, might have been copied for the
<Q><L><HI>"Grim-vi&s;aged comfortle&s;s De&s;pair"</HI></L></Q>
of the poet.</P>
<P>No words were exchanged between him and the guard; but on perceiving who were without, he open|ed the iron gate, and the pri&s;oners having alighted, pa&s;&s;ed with the two officials beneath the arch, the guard following with a torch.&mdash;They de&s;cended a flight of broad &s;teps, at the foot of which another iron gate admitted them to a kind of hall; &s;uch, however, it at fir&s;t appeared to Vivaldi, as his eyes glanced through its gloomy extent, imperfectly a&s;certaining it by the lamp, which hung from the centre of the roof. No per&s;on appeared, and a death like &s;ilence prevailed; for neither the officials nor the guard yet &s;poke; nor did any di&s;tant &s;ound contradict the notion, that they were traver&s;ing the chambers of the dead. To Vivaldi it occurred, that this was one if the bu|rial vaults of the victims, who &s;uffered in the Inqui|&s;ition, and his whole frame thrilled with horror. Se|veral avenues, opening from the apartment, &s;eemed to lead to di&s;tant quarters of this immen&s;e fabric, but &s;till no foot&s;tep whi&s;pering along the pavement, or voice murmuring through the arched roofs, indicated it to be the re&s;idence of the living.</P>
<P>Having entered one of the pa&s;&s;ages, Vivaldi per|ceived a per&s;on cloathed in black, and who bore a lighted taper, cro&s;&s;ing &s;ilently in the remote per&s;pec|tive, and he under&s;tood too well from his habit, that he was a member of this dreadful tribunal.</P>
<P>The &s;ound of foot&s;teps &s;eemed to reach the &s;trang|er, for he turned, and, then pau&s;ed while the officers advanced. They then made &s;igns to each other, and
<PB N="279" REF="032735_0277_0FF495F2D0BFF6C0">
exchanged a few words, which neither Vivaldi or his &s;ervant could under&s;tand, when the &s;tranger, pointing with his taper along another avenue, pa&s;&s;ed away. Vivaldi followed him with his eyes, till a door at the extremity of the pa&s;&s;age opened, and he &s;aw the In|qui&s;itor enter an apartment, whence a great light pro|ceeded, and where &s;everal other figures habited like him&s;elf, appeared waiting to receive him. The door immediately clo&s;ed; and, whether the imagination of Vivaldi was affected, or that the &s;ounds were real, he thought, as it clo&s;ed, he di&s;tingui&s;hed half-&s;tifled groans, as of a per&s;on in agony.</P>
<P>The avenue, through which the pri&s;oners pa&s;&s;ed, opened at length, into an apartment gloomy like the fir&s;t they had entered, but more exten&s;ive. The roof was &s;upported by arches, and long arcades branch|ed off from every &s;ide of the chamber, as from a cen|tral point, and where lo&s;t in the gloom, which the rays of the &s;mall lamps, &s;u&s;pended in each, but feebly pe|nenetrated.</P>
<P>They re&s;ted here, and a per&s;on &s;oon after advanced, who appeared to be the jailor, into who&s;e hands Vi|valdi and Paulo were delivered. A few my&s;terious words having been exchanged, one of the officials cro&s;&s;ed the hall and a&s;cended a wide &s;tair-ca&s;e, while the other, with the jailor and the guard, remained be|low as if awaiting his return.</P>
<P>A long interval elap&s;ed, during which the &s;tillne&s;s of the place was &s;ometimes interrupted by a clo&s;ing door, and, at others, by indi&s;tinct &s;ounds, which yet appeared to Vivaldi like lamentations and extorted groans. Inqui&s;itors, in their long black robes, i&s;&s;ued from time to time from the pa&s;&s;ages, and cro&s;&s;ed the hall to other avenues. They eyed the pri&s;oners with curio&s;ity, but without pity. Their vi&s;ages, with few exceptions, &s;eemed &s;tamped with the characters of de|mons. Vivaldi could not look upon the grave cru|elty,
<PB N="280" REF="032735_0278_0FF495A8F475A830">
or the ferocious impatience, their countenances &s;everally expre&s;&s;ed, without reading in them the fate of &s;ome fellow creature, the fate which the&s;e men &s;eem|ed going, even at this moment, to confirm; and as they pa&s;&s;ed with &s;oundle&s;s &s;teps, he &s;hrunk from ob|&s;ervation, as if their very look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;uper|natural power, and could have &s;truck death. But he followed their fleeting figures, as they proceeded on their work of horror, to where the la&s;t glimmering ray faded into darkne&s;s, expecting to &s;ee other doors of other chambers open to receive them. While meditating upon the&s;e horrors, Vivaldi lo&s;t every &s;el|fi&s;h con&s;ideration in a&s;toni&s;hment and indignation of the &s;ufferings, which the frenzied wickedne&s;s of man prepares for man, who, even at the moment of inflic|tion, in&s;ults his victim with a&s;&s;ertions of the ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity of procedure. "Is this po&s;&s;ible!" &s;aid Vivaldi internally: "Can this be in human nature!&mdash;Can &s;uch horrible perver&s;ion of right be permit|ted! Can man, who calls him&s;elf endowed with rea|&s;on, and immea&s;urably &s;uperior to every other created being, argue him&s;elf into the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch hor|rible folly, &s;uch inveterate cruelty, as exceeds all the acts of the mo&s;t irrational and ferocious brute. Brutes do not deliberately &s;laughter their &s;pecies; it remains for man only, man, proud of his prerogative of rea&s;on, and boa&s;ting of his &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, to unite the mo&s;t terrible extremes of folly and wickedne&s;s!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi had been no &s;tranger to the exi&s;tence of this tribunal; he had long under&s;tood the nature of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, and had often received particular ac|counts of its cu&s;toms and laws; but, though he had believed before, it was now only that conviction ap|peared to impre&s;s his under&s;tanding. A new view of human nature &s;eemed to bur&s;t, at once, upon his mind, and he could not have experienced greater a&s;toni&s;h|ment, if this had been the fir&s;t moment, in which he
<PB N="281" REF="032735_0279_0FF495F4577F26E8">
had heard of the in&s;titution&mdash;But, when he thought of Ellena, con&s;idered that &s;he was in the power of this tribunal, and that it was probable &s;he was, at this moment within the &s;ame dreadful walls, grief, indig|nation, and de&s;pair irritated him almo&s;t to frenzy. He &s;eemed &s;uddenly animated with &s;upernatural &s;trength and ready to attempt impo&s;&s;ibilities for her deliverance. It was by a &s;trong effort for &s;elf-com|mand, that he forbore bur&s;ting the bonds, which held him, and making a de&s;perate attempt to &s;eek her through the va&s;t extent of the&s;e pri&s;ons. Reflection, however, had not &s;o entirely for&s;aken him, but that he &s;aw the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucceeding in &s;uch an effort the moment he had conceived it, and he forbore to ru&s;h upon the certain de&s;truction to which it mu&s;t have led. His pa&s;&s;ions, thus re&s;trained, &s;eemed to become virtues, and to di&s;play them&s;elves in the energy of his courage and his fortitude. His &s;oul became &s;tern and vigorous in de&s;pair, and his manner and countenance a&s;&s;umed a calm dignity, which &s;eemed to awe, in &s;ome degree, even his guards. The pain of his wounds was no longer felt; it appeared as if the &s;trength of his in|tellectual &s;elf had &s;ubdued the infirmities of the body, and, perhaps, in the&s;e moments of elevation, he could have endured the torture without &s;hrinking.</P>
<P>Paulo, meanwhile, mute and grave, was watchful of all that pa&s;&s;ed; he ob&s;erved the revolutions in his ma&s;ters mind, with grief fir&s;t, and then with &s;urprize, but he could imitate the noble fortitude, which now gave weight and &s;teadine&s;s to Vivaldi's thoughts. And when he looked on the power and gloom around him. and on the vi&s;ages of the pa&s;&s;ing inqui&s;itors, he began to repent, that he had &s;o freely delivered his opinion of this tribunal, in the pre&s;ence of tis agents, and to perceive, that if he played up the kind of tune he had threatened, it would probably be the la&s;t he &s;hould ever be permitted to perform in this world.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="032735_0280_0FF495AA7B057B58">
At length, the chief officer de&s;cended the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and immediately bade Vivaldi follow him. Paulo was accompanying his ma&s;ter, but was withheld by the guard, and told he was to be di&s;po&s;ed of in a different way. This was the moment of his &s;evere&s;t trial; he declared he would not be &s;eparated from his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>"What did I demand to be brought here for," he cried, "if it was not that I might go &s;hares with the &s;ignor in all his troubles? This is not a place to come for plea&s;ure, I warrant; and I can promi&s;e ye, gentle|men, I would not have come within a hundred miles of you, if it had not been for my ma&s;ter's &s;ake."</P>
<P>The guards roughly interrupted him, and were car|rying him away, when Vivaldi's commanding voice arre&s;ted them. He returned to &s;peak a few words of con&s;olation to his faithful &s;ervant, and &s;ince they were to be &s;eparated, to take leave of him.</P>
<P>Paulo embraced his knees, and, while he wept, and his words were almo&s;t &s;tifled by &s;obs, declared no force &s;hould drag him from his ma&s;ter, while he had life; and repeatedly appealed to the guards, with&mdash;"what did I demand to be brought here for? Did ever any body come here to &s;eek plea&s;ure? What right have you to prevent my going &s;hares with my ma&s;ter in his troubles?"</P>
<P>"We do not intend to deny you that plea&s;ure, friend," replied one of the guards.</P>
<P>"Don't you? Then heaven ble&s;s you!" cried Paulo, &s;pringing from his knees, and &s;haking the man by the hand with a violence, that would nearly have di&s;located the &s;houlder of a per&s;on le&s;s robu&s;t.</P>
<P>"So, come with us," added the guard, drawing him away from Vivaldi. Paulo now become outra|geous, and, &s;truggling with the guards, bur&s;t from them, and again fell at the feet of his ma&s;ter, who rai&s;ed and embraced him, endeavouring to prevail with
<PB N="283" REF="032735_0281_0FF495FDED954408">
him to &s;ubmit quietly to what was inevitable, and to encourage him with hope.</P>
<P>"I tru&s;t that our &s;eparation will be &s;hort," &s;aid Vi|valdi, "and that we &s;hall meet in happier circum|&s;tances, My innocence mu&s;t &s;oon appear."</P>
<P>"We &s;hall never, never meet again, Signor-mio, in this world," &s;aid Paulo, &s;obbing violently, "&s;o don't make me hope &s;o. That old Abbe&s;s knows what &s;he is about too well to let us e&s;cape; or &s;he would not have catched us up &s;o cunningly as &s;he did; &s;o, what &s;ignifies innocence! O! if my old lord, the Marche&s;e, did but know where we are!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi interrupted him, and turning to the guards, &s;aid, "I recommend my faithful &s;ervant to your com|pa&s;&s;ion; he is innocent. It will &s;ome time, perhaps, be in my power to recompence you for any indulgence, you may allow him, and I &s;hall value it a thou&s;and times more highly, than any you could &s;hew to my|&s;elf! Farewell, Paulo,&mdash;farewell! Officer, I am read."</P>
<P>"O &s;tay! Signor, for one moment&mdash;&s;tay," &s;aid Paulo.</P>
<P>"We can wait no longer," &s;aid the guard, and again drew Paulo away, who looking piteou&s;ly after Vi|valdi, alternately repeated, Farewell, dear mae&s;tro! farewell dear, dear mae&s;tro!" and "What did I de|mand to be brought here for?&mdash;What did I demand to be brought here for?&mdash;what was it for, if not to go &s;hares with my mae&s;tro?" till Vivaldi was beyond the reach of &s;ight and of hearing.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, having followed the Officer up the &s;tair-ca&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed through a gallery to an antichamber, where, being delivered into the cu&s;tody of &s;ome per&s;ons in waiting, his conductor di&s;appeared beyond a folding door, that led to an inner apartment. Over this door was an in&s;cription in Hebrew characters, traced in blood-colour. Dante's in&s;cription on the entrance of
<PB N="284" REF="032735_0282_0FF495B5B880C090">
the infernal regions, would have been &s;uitable to a place, where every circum&s;tance and feature &s;eemed to &s;ay, <HI>"Hope, that comes to all, comes not here!"</HI></P>
<P>Vivaldi conjectured that in this chamber, they were preparing for him the in&s;truments which were to ex|tort a confe&s;&s;ion; and though he knew little of the re|gular proceedings of this tribunal, he had always un|der&s;tood, that the torture was inflicted upon the accu|&s;ed per&s;on, till he made confe&s;&s;ion of the crime, of which he was &s;u&s;pected. By &s;uch a mode of proceed|ing, the innocent were certain of &s;uffering longer than the guilty; for, as they had nothing to confe&s;s, the In|qui&s;itor, mi&s;taken innocence for ob&s;tinacy, per&s;ever|ed in his inflictions, and it frequently happened that he compelled the innocent to become criminal, and a&s;&s;ert a fal&s;ehood, that they might be relea&s;ed from an|gui&s;h, which they could no longer &s;u&s;tain. Vivaldi con&s;idered this circum&s;tance undauntedly; every fa|culty of his &s;oul was bent up to firmne&s;s and endurance. He believed that he under&s;tood the extent of the charge, which would be brought again&s;t him, a charge as fal&s;e, as a &s;pecious confirmation of it, would be ter|rible in its con&s;equence both to Ellena and him&s;elf. Yet every art would be practi&s;ed to bring him to an acknowledgement of having carried off a nun, and he knew al&s;o, that, &s;ince the pro&s;ecutor and the witne&s;&s;es are never confronted with the pri&s;oner in ca&s;es of &s;e|vere accu&s;ation, and &s;ince their very names are con|cealed from him, it would be &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for him, to prove his innocence. But he did not he&s;itate an in&s;tant whether to &s;acrifice him&s;elf for Ellena, deter|mining rather to expire beneath the mercile&s;s inflic|tions of the Inqui&s;itors, than to a&s;&s;ert a fla&s;ehood, which mu&s;t involve her in de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The officer, at length, appeared, and, having beck|oned Vivaldi to advance, uncovered his head, and bar|ed his arms. He then led him forward through the
<PB N="285" REF="032735_0283_0FF494B5EC31C438">
folding door into the chamber; having done which, he immediately withdrew, and the door, which &s;hut out Hope, clo&s;ed after him.</P>
<P>Vivaldi found him&s;elf in a &s;pacious apartment, where only two per&s;ons were vi&s;ible, who were &s;eated at a large table, that occupied the centre of the room. They were both habited in black; the one, who &s;eem|ed by his piercing eye, and extraordinary phy&s;iogno|my, to be an Inqui&s;itor, wore on his head a kind of black turban, which heightened the natural ferocity of his vi&s;age; the other was uncovered, and his arms bared to the elbows. A book, with &s;ome in&s;truments of &s;ingular appearance lay before him. Round the table were &s;everal unoccupied chairs, on the backs of which appeared figurative &s;igns, at the upper end of the apartment, a gigantic crucifix &s;tretched nearly to the vaulted roof; and, at the lower end, &s;u&s;pended from an arch in the wall, was a dark curtain, but whether it veiled a window, or &s;hrowded &s;ome object or per&s;on, nece&s;&s;ary to the de&s;igns of the Inqui&s;itor, there were little means of judging. It was, however, &s;u&s;pended from an arch &s;uch as &s;ometimes contains a ca&s;ement, or leads to a deep rece&s;s.</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor called on Vivaldi to advance, and when he had reached the table, put a book into his hands, and bade him &s;wear to reveal the truth, and keep for ever &s;ecret whatever he might &s;ee or hear in the apartment.</P>
<P>Vivaldi he&s;itated to obey &s;o unqualified a command. The Inqui&s;itor reminded him, by a look, not to be mi&s;taken, that he was ab&s;olute here; but Vivaldi &s;till he&s;itated. "Shall I con&s;ent to my own condemna|tion?" &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "The malice of demons like the&s;e may convert the mo&s;t innocent circum|&s;tances into matter of accu&s;ation, for my de&s;truction, and I mu&s;t an&s;wer whatever que&s;tions they choo&s;e to a&s;k. And &s;hall I &s;wear, al&s;o, to conceal whatever I
<PB N="286" REF="032735_0284_0FF495B43106DB88">
may witne&s;s in this chamber, when I know that the mo&s;t diabolical cruelties are hourly practi&s;ed here?"</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor, in a voice which would have made a heart, le&s;s fortified than was Vivaldi's tremble, again commanded him to &s;wear; at the &s;ame time, he made a &s;ignal to the per&s;on, who &s;at at the oppo&s;ite end of table, and who appeared to be an inferior officer.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was &s;till &s;ilent, but he began to con&s;ider that, uncon&s;cious as he was of crime, it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for his words to be tortured into &s;elf-accu&s;a|tion; and that, whatever he might witne&s;s, no retribu|tion would be prevented, no evil withheld by the oath, which bound him to &s;ecre&s;y, &s;ince his mo&s;t &s;evere de|nunciation could avail nothing again&s;t the &s;upreme power of the tribunal. As he did not perceive any good, which could ari&s;e from refu&s;ing the oath; and &s;aw much immediate evil from re&s;i&s;tance, he con&s;ented to receive it. Notwith&s;tanding this, when he put the book to his lips, and uttered the tremendous vow pre&s;crib|ed to him, he&s;itation and reluctance returned upon his mind, and an icy coldne&s;s &s;truck to his heart. He was &s;o much affected, that circum&s;tances, apparently the mo&s;t trivial, had at this moment influence upon his imagination. As he accidentally threw his eyes upon the curtain, which he had ob&s;erved before with|out emotion, and now thought it moved, he almo&s;t &s;tarted in expectation of &s;eeing &s;ome per&s;on, an Inqui|&s;itor perhaps, as terrific as the one before him, or an accu&s;er as malicious as Schedoni, &s;teal from behind it</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor having admini&s;tered the oath, and the attendant having noted it in his book, the exami|nation began. After demanding, as is u&s;ual, the names and titles of Vivaldi and his family, and his place of re&s;idence, to which he fully replied, the In|qui&s;itor a&s;ked, whether he under&s;tood the nature of the accu&s;ation on which he had been arre&s;ted.</P>
<P>"The order for my arre&s;tation informed me," re|plied Vivaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="032735_0285_0FF4960102365860">
"Look to your words!" &s;aid the Inqui&s;itor, "and re|member your oath. What was the ground of accu|&s;ation?"</P>
<P>"I under&s;tood," &s;aid Vivaldi, "that I was accu&s;ed of having &s;tolen a nun from her &s;anctuary."</P>
<P>A faint degree of &s;urprize appeared on the brow of the Inqui&s;itor. "You confe&s;s it, then?" he &s;aid, after a pau&s;e of a moment, and making a &s;ignal to the Se|cretary, who immediately noted Vivaldi's words.</P>
<P>"I &s;olemnly deny it," replied Vivaldi: "the accu|&s;ation is fal&s;e and malicious."</P>
<P>"Remember the oath you have taken! repeated the Inqui&s;itor: learn, al&s;o, that mercy is &s;hewn to &s;uch as make full confe&s;&s;ion; but that the torture is applied to tho&s;e, who have the folly and ob&s;tinacy to withhold the truth."</P>
<P>"If you torture me till I acknowledge the ju&s;tne&s;s of this accu&s;ation," &s;aid Vivaldi, "I mu&s;t expire under your inflictions, for &s;uffering never &s;hall compel me to a&s;&s;ert a fal&s;hood. It is not the truth, which you &s;eek; it is not the guilty whom you puni&s;h; the innocent, ha|ving no crimes to confe&s;s, are the victims of your cru|elty, or, to e&s;cape from it, become criminal, and pro|claim a lie."</P>
<P>"Recollect your&s;elf," &s;aid the Inqui&s;itor, &s;ternly. "You are not brought hither to accu&s;e, but to an&s;wer accu&s;ation. You &s;ay you are innocent; yet acknow|ledge your&s;elf to be acquainted with the &s;ubject of the charge which is to be urged again&s;t you! How could you know this, but from the voice of con&s;cience?"</P>
<P>"From the words of your own &s;ummons," replied Vivaldi, "and from tho&s;e of your officials who arre&s;ted me."</P>
<P>"How!" exclaimed the Inqui&s;itor: "note that," pointing to the Secretary, "he &s;ays by the words of our &s;ummous; now we know, that you never read that &s;ummons. He &s;ays al&s;o by the words of our officials; it appears, then, he is ignorant, that death would fol|low &s;uch a breach of confidence."</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="032735_0286_0FF495B74432AD30">
"It is true, I never did read the &s;ummons," replied Vivaldi, "and as true, that I never a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ted I did; the friar, who read it, told of what it accu&s;ed me, and your officials confirmed the te&s;timony."</P>
<P>"No more of this equivocation!" &s;aid the Inqui|&s;itor, "Speak only to the que&s;tion."</P>
<P>"I will not &s;uffer my a&s;&s;ertions to be mi&s;repre&s;ent|ed," replied Vivaldi, "or my words to be perverted again&s;t my&s;elf. I have &s;worn to &s;peak the truth on|ly; &s;ince you believe I violate my oath, and doubt my direct and &s;imple words, I will &s;peak no more,"</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor half ro&s;e from his chair, and his coun|tenance grew paler. "Audacious heretic!" he &s;aid, "will you di&s;pute, in&s;ult, and di&s;obey, the commands of our mo&s;t holy tribunal! You will be taught the con&s;equence of your de&s;perate impiety To the tor|ture with him!"</P>
<P>A &s;tern &s;mile was on the features of Vivaldi; his eyes were calmly fixed on the Inqui&s;itor, and his at|titude was undaunted and firm. His courage, and the cool contempt, which his looks expre&s;&s;ed, &s;eemed to touch his examiner, who perceived that he had not a common mind to operate upon. He abandoned, therefore, for the pre&s;ent, terrific mea&s;ures, and, re&s;um|ing his u&s;ual manner proceeded in the examination.</P>
<P>"Where were you arre&s;ted?"</P>
<P>"At the chapel of San Seba&s;tian on the lake of Ce|lano."</P>
<P>You are certain as to this?" a&s;ked the Inqui&s;itor, "you are &s;ure it was not at the village of Legano, on the high road betwen Celano and Rome?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi while he confirmed his a&s;&s;ertion, recollect|ed, with &s;ome &s;urprize, that Legano was the place where the guard had been changed, and he mentioned the cir|cum&s;tance. The Inqui&s;itor, however, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> in his que&s;tions, without appearing to notice it. "Was any per&s;on arre&s;ted with you?"</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="032735_0287_0FF49602888C52F0">
"You cannot be ignorant," replied Vivaldi, "that Signora di Ro&s;alba, was &s;eized at the &s;ame time, upon the fal&s;e charge of being a nun, who had broken her vows, and eloped from her convent; nor that Paulo Mendrico, my faithful &s;ervant! was al&s;o made a pri|&s;oner, though upon what pretence he was arre&s;ted I am utterly ignorant."</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor remained for &s;ome moments in thoughtful &s;ilence, and then enquired &s;lightly concern|ing the family of Ellena, and her u&s;ual place of re&s;i|dence. Vivaldi, fearful of making &s;ome a&s;&s;ertion that might be prejudicial to her, referred him to her&s;elf; but the inquiry was repeated.</P>
<P>"She is now within the&s;e walls," replied Vivaldi, hoping to learn from the manner of his examiner whe|ther his fears were ju&s;t," and can an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;|tions better than my&s;elf."</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor merely bade the notary write down her name, and then remained for a few moments me|ditating. At length, he &s;aid, "Do you know where you now are?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi, &s;miling at the que&s;tion, replied, "I under|&s;tand that I am in the pri&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition at Rome."</P>
<P>"Do you know what are the crimes that &s;ubject per&s;ons to the cognizance of the Holy Office?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Your con&s;cience informs <HI>you,</HI> and your &s;ilence confirms <HI>me.</HI> Let me admoni&s;h you, once more, to make a full confe&s;&s;ion of your guilt; remember that this is a merciful tribunal, and &s;hews favour to &s;uch as acknowledge their crimes?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi &s;miled; but the Inqui&s;itor proceeded.</P>
<P>"It does not re&s;emble &s;ome &s;evere, yet ju&s;t courts, where immediate execution follows the confe&s;&s;ion of a criminal. No! it is merciful, and though it puni&s;hes guilt, it never applies the torture but in ca&s;es of nece&s;|&s;ity,
<PB N="290" REF="032735_0288_0FF58514A6D2F700">
when the ob&s;tinate &s;ilence of the pri&s;oner re|quires &s;uch a mea&s;ure, You &s;ee, therefore, what you may avoid, and what expect."</P>
<P>"But if the pri&s;oner has nothing to confe&s;s?" &s;aid Vivaldi.&mdash;"Can your tortures make him guilty? They may force a weak mind to be guilty of fal&s;ehood; to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ape pre&s;ent angui&s;h, a man may unwarily con|demn him&s;elf to the death! You will find that I am not &s;uch an one."</P>
<P>"Young man," replied the Inqui&s;itor, "you will under&s;tand too &s;oon, that we never act, but upon &s;ure authority; and will wi&s;h, too late, that you had made an hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion. Your &s;ilence cannot keep from us a knowledge of your offences; we are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of facts; and your ob&s;tinacy can neither wre&s;t from us the truth, or pervert it. Your mo&s;t &s;ecret offences are already written on the table<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the Holy Office; your con&s;cience cannot reflect them more ju&s;tly.&mdash;Tremble therefore, and revere. But under&s;tand, that, though we have &s;ufficient proof of your guilt, we re|quire you to confe&s;s; and that the puni&s;hment of ob|&s;tinacy is as certain, as that of any other offence."</P>
<P>Vivaldi made no reply, and the Inqui&s;itor, after a momentary &s;ilence, added, "Was you ever in the church of the Spirito Santo, at Naples!"</P>
<P>"Before I an&s;wer the que&s;tion," &s;aid Vivaldi "I require the name of my accu&s;er."</P>
<P>"You are to recollect, that you have no right to demand any thing in this place," ob&s;erved the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, "not can o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> be ignorant that the name of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is always kept &s;acred from the knowledge of the accu&s;ed. Who would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to do his duty, if his name was arbitrarily to be expo&s;ed to the ven|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ance of the criminal again&s;t whom he informs? It is only in a particular proces that the accuser is brought forward."</P>
<P>The names of the Witne&s;&s;es?" demanded Vival|di.
<PB N="291" REF="032735_0289_0FF4960DA5A2C7E8">
"The &s;ame ju&s;tice conceals them al&s;o from the knowledge of the accu&s;ed," replied the Inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>"And is no ju&s;tice left for the Accu&s;ed," &s;aid Vi|valdi, "Is he to be tried and condemned without be|ing confronted with either his Pro&s;ecutor or the Wit|ne&s;&s;es!"</P>
<P>"Your que&s;tions are too many," &s;aid the Inqui&s;itor, "and your an&s;wers too few. The Informer is not al|&s;o the Pro&s;ecutor; the Holy Office before which the information is laid, is the Pro&s;ecutor, and the di&s;pen|&s;er of ju&s;tice; its Public Accu&s;er lays the circum|&s;tances, and the te&s;timonies of the Witne&s;&s;es, before the Court. But too much of this."</P>
<P>"How!" exclaimed Vivaldi, "is the tribunal at once the Pro&s;ecutor, Witne&s;s and Judge! What can private malice wi&s;h for more, than &s;uch a court of <HI>ju&s;|tice,</HI> at which to arraign its enemy? The &s;tiletto of the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in is not &s;o &s;ure, or &s;o fatal to innocence. I now perceive, that it avails me nothing to be guiltle&s;s; a &s;ingle enemy is &s;ufficient to accompli&s;h my de&s;truc|tion."</P>
<P>"You have an enemy then?" ob&s;erved the Inqui|&s;itor.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was too well convinced that he had one, but there was not &s;ufficient proof, as to the per&s;on of this enemy, to ju&s;tify him in a&s;&s;erting that it was Sche|doni. The circum&s;tance of Ellena having been ar|re&s;ted, would have compelled him to &s;u&s;pect another per&s;on as being at lea&s;t acce&s;&s;ary to the de&s;igns of the Confe&s;&s;or; had not credulity &s;tarted in horror from the &s;uppo&s;ition, that a mother's re&s;entment could po&s;&s;ibly betray her &s;on into the pri&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition, though this mother had exhibited a temper of remor&s;e|le&s;s cruelty towards a &s;tranger, who had interrupted her views for that &s;on.</P>
<P>"You have an enemy then?" repeated the Inqui|&s;itor.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="032735_0290_0FF495B8CBB9C520">
"That I am her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ufficiently proves it," replied Vivaldi. "But I am &s;o little any man's enemy, that I know not who to call mine."</P>
<P>"It is evident, then, that you have no enemy," ob|&s;erved the &s;ubtle Inqui&s;itor, "and that this accu&s;ation is brought again&s;t you by a re&s;pecter of truth, and a faithful &s;ervant of the Roman intere&s;t."</P>
<P>Vivaldi was &s;hocked to perceive the in&s;idious art, by which he had been betrayed into a declaration ap|parently &s;o harmle&s;s, and the cruel dexterity with which it had been turned again&s;t him. A lofty and contemptuous &s;ilence was all that he oppo&s;ed to the treachery of his examiner, on who&s;e countenance ap|peared a &s;mile of triumph and &s;elf congratulation, the life of a fellow-creature being, in his e&s;timation, of no comparative importance with the &s;elf-applau&s;es of &s;uc|ce&s;sful art; the art, too, upon which he mo&s;t valued him&s;elf&mdash;that of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor proceeded, "You per&s;i&s;t, then, in withholding the truth?" He pau&s;ed, but Vivaldi mak|ing no reply, he re&s;umed.</P>
<P>"Since it is evident, from your own declaration, that you have no enemy, whom private re&s;entment might have in&s;tigated to accu&s;e you; and, from other circum&s;tances which have occured in your conduct, that you are con&s;cious of more than you have con|fe&s;&s;ed&mdash;it appears, that the accu&s;ation which has been urged again&s;t you, is not a malicious &s;lander. I ex|hort you, therefore, and once more conjure you, by our how faith, to make an ingenuous confe&s;&s;ion of your offences, and to &s;ave your&s;elf from the means, which mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be enforced to obtain a confe&s;&s;ion before your trial commences. I adjure you, al&s;o, to con&s;ider, that by &s;uch open conduct only, can mercy b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> won to &s;often the ju&s;tice of this mo&s;t righteous tribunal!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi, perceiving that it was now nece&s;&s;ary for
<PB N="293" REF="032735_0291_0FF4960F2CCEEE98">
him to reply, once more &s;olemnly a&s;&s;erted his innocence of the crime alleged again&s;t him in the &s;ummons, and of the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of any act, which might lawfully &s;ubject him to the notice of the Holy Office.</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itor again demanded what was the crime alledged, and, Vivaldi having repeated the accu&s;ation, he again bade the Secretary note it; as he did which, Vivaldi thought he perceived upon his features &s;ome|thing of a malignant &s;atisfaction, for which he knew not how to account. When the Secretary had fini&s;h|ed, Vivaldi was ordered to &s;ub&s;cribe his name and qua|lity to the depo&s;itions, and he obeyed.</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor then bade him con&s;ider of the ad|monition he had received, and prepare either to con|fe&s;s on the morrow, or to undergo the que&s;tion. As he concluded, he gave a &s;ignal, and the officer, who had conducted Vivaldi into the chamber, immediately ap|peared.</P>
<P>"You know your orders, &s;aid the Inqui&s;itor, "re|ceive your pri&s;oner, and &s;ee that they are obeyed."</P>
<P>The official bowed, and Vivaldi followed him from the apartment in melancholy &s;ilence.</P>

<P>ELLENA, meanwhile, when &s;he had been carried from the chapel of San Seba&s;tian, was placed up|on a hor&s;e in waiting, and, guarded by the two men who had &s;eized her, commenced a journey, which con|tinued with little interruption during two nights and days. She had no means of judging whither &s;he was going, and li&s;tened in vain expectation, for the feet of hor&s;es, and the voice of Vivaldi, who, &s;he had been told was following on the &s;ame road.</P>
<P>The &s;teps of travellers &s;eldom broke upon the &s;i|lence of the&s;e regions, and during the journey, &s;he was met only by &s;ome market people pa&s;&s;ing to a neighbour|ing town, or now and then by the vine-dre&s;&s;ers or la|bourers in the olive grounds; and &s;he de&s;cended up|on the va&s;t plains of Apulia, &s;till ignorant of her &s;i|tuation. An encampment, not of warriors, but of
<PB N="4" REF="032735_0294_0FF496508DB239C0">
&s;hepherds, who were leading their flocks to the moun|tains of Abruzzo, enlivened a &s;mall tract of the&s;e lev|els, which were &s;hadowed on the north and ea&s;t by the mountainous ridge of the Garganus, &s;treching from the Apennine far into the Adriatic.</P>
<P>The appearance of the &s;hepherds was nearly as wild and &s;avage as that of the men, who conducted Ellena; but their pa&s;toral in&s;truments of flageolets and tabors &s;poke of more civilized feelings, as they &s;ounded &s;weet|ly over the de&s;ert. Her guards re&s;ted, and refre&s;hed them&s;elves with goats milk, barly cakes, and almonds, and the manners of the&s;e &s;hepherds, like tho&s;e &s;he had formerly met with on the mountains, proved to be more ho&s;pitable than their air had indicated.</P>
<P>After Ellena had quitted this pa&s;toral camp, no ve&s;|tage of a human re&s;idence appeared for &s;everal leagues, except here and there the towers of a decayed fortre&s;s, perched upon the lofty acclivities &s;he was approach|ing, and half concealed in the woods. The evening of the &s;econd day was drawing on, when her guards drew near the fore&s;t, which &s;he had long ob&s;erved in the di&s;tance, &s;preading over the many-ri&s;ing &s;teeps of the Garganus, They entered by a track, a road it could not be called, which led among oaks and gi|gantic che&s;nuts, apparently the growth of centuries, and &s;o thickly interwoven, that their branches formed a canopy which &s;eldom admitted the &s;ky. The gloom which they threw around, and the thickets of cy&s;tus, juniper, and lenticus, which flouri&s;hed beneath the &s;hade, gave a character of fearful wildne&s;s to the &s;cene.</P>
<P>Having reached an eminence, where the trees were more thinkly &s;cattered, Ellena perceived the fore&s;ts &s;preading on all &s;ides among hills and vallies, and de|&s;cending towards the Adriatic, which bounded the di&s;|tance in front. The coa&s;t, bending into a bay, was rocky and bold. Lofty pinacles, wooded to their &s;um|mits, ro&s;e over the &s;hores, and cliffs of naked marble
<PB N="5" REF="032735_0295_0FF46ECC051135F0">
of &s;uch gigantic proportions, that they were awful even at a di&s;tance, obtruded them&s;elves far into the waves, brea&s;ting their eternal fury. Beyond the mar|gin of the coa&s;t, as far as the eye could reach, appear|ed pointed mountains, darkened with forre&s;ts, ri&s;ing ridge over ridge, in many &s;ucce&s;&s;ions. Ellena, as &s;he &s;urveyed this wild &s;cenery, felt as if &s;he was going into eternal bani&s;hment from &s;ociety. She was tran|quil, but it was with the quietne&s;s of exhau&s;ted grief, not of re&s;ignation; and &s;he looked back upon the pa&s;t, and awaited the future, with a kind of out breathed de&s;pair.</P>
<P>She had travelled for &s;ome miles through the fore&s;t, her guards only now and then uttering to each other a que&s;tion, or an ob&s;ervation concerning the changes which had taken place in the bordering &s;cenery, &s;ince they la&s;t pa&s;t it, when night began to clo&s;e in upon them</P>
<P>Ellena perceived her approach to the &s;ea, only by the murmurs of its &s;urge upon the rocky coa&s;t, till having reached an eminence, which was, however, no more than the ba&s;e of two woody mountaims that towered clo&s;ely over it, &s;he &s;aw dimly its grey &s;urface &s;preading in the bay below. She now ventured to a&s;k how much farther &s;he had to go, and whether &s;he was to be taken on board one of the little ve&s;&s;els, ap|parently fi&s;hing &s;macks, that &s;he could ju&s;t di&s;cern at anchor.</P>
<P>"You have not far to go now," replied one of the guards, furlily; "you will &s;oon be at the end of your journey, and at re&s;t."</P>
<P>They de&s;cended to the &s;hore, and pre&s;ently came to a lonely dwelling, which &s;tood &s;o near the margin of the &s;ea, as almo&s;t to be wa&s;hed by the waves. No light appeared at any of the lattices; and, from the &s;ilence that reigned within, it &s;eemed to be uninhabit|ed. The guard had probably rea&s;on to know other|wi&s;e,
<PB N="6" REF="032735_0296_0FF4965B4C41AA30">
for they halted at the door, and &s;houted with all their &s;trength. No voice, however, an&s;wered to their call, and, while they per&s;evered in efforts to rou&s;e the inhabitants, Ellena anxiou&s;ly examined the building, as exactly as the twilight would permit. It was of an ancient and peculiar &s;tructure, and though &s;carcely important enough for a man&s;ion, had evidently never been de&s;igned for the re&s;idence of pea&s;ants.</P>
<P>The walls of unhewn marble, were high, and &s;trength|ened by ba&s;tions; and the edifice had turreted corners, which, with the porch in front, and the &s;loping roof, were falling fa&s;t into numerous &s;ymtoms of decay. The whole building, with its dark windows and &s;oundle&s;s avenues, had an air &s;trikingly forlorn and &s;olitary. A high wall &s;urrounded the &s;mall court in which it &s;tood, and probably had once &s;erved as a de|fence to the dwelling; but the gates, which &s;hould have clo&s;ed again&s;t intruders, could no longer per|form their office; one of the folds had dropped from its fa&s;tenings, and lay on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he ground almo&s;t conceal|ed in a deep bed of weeds, and the other creaked on its hinges to every bla&s;t, at each &s;wing &s;eeming ready to follow the fate of its companion.</P>
<P>The repeated calls of the guard were at length an|&s;wered by a rough voice from within; when the door of the porch was lazily unbarred, and opened by a man, who&s;e vi&s;age was &s;o mi&s;ery-&s;truck, that Elle|na could not look upon it with indifference, though wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pt in mi&s;ery of her own. The lamp he held threw a gleam athwart it, and &s;hewed the gaunt ferocity of famine, to which the &s;hadow of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> eyes added a terrific wildne&s;s. Ellena &s;hrunk while &s;he gazed. She had never before &s;een villainy and &s;uffering &s;o &s;trongly pictured on the &s;ame face, and &s;he ob&s;erved him with a degree of thrilling curio&s;ity, which for a moment excluded from her mind all con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the evils to be apprehended from him.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="032735_0297_0FF46ED102B46DB8">
It was evident that this hou&s;e had not been built for his reception; and &s;he conjectured that he was he &s;ervant of &s;ome cruel agent of the Marche&s;a di Vi|valdi.</P>
<P>From the porch &s;he followed into an old hall, ruin|ous and de&s;titute of any kind of furniture. It was not exten&s;ive but lofty, for it &s;eemed to a&s;cend to the roof of the edifice, and the chambers above opened around it into a corridor.</P>
<P>Some half-&s;ullen &s;alutations were exchanged between the guard and the &s;tranger, whom they called Spalatro, as they pa&s;&s;ed into a chamber, where it appeared that he had been &s;leeping on a mattre&s;s laid in a corner. All the other furniture of the place were two or three broken chairs and a table. He eyed Ellena with a &s;hrewd contracted brow, and then looked &s;ignificant|ly at the guard, but was &s;ilent, till he de&s;ired them all to &s;it down, adding, that he would dre&s;s &s;ome fi&s;h for &s;upper. Ellena di&s;covered that this man was the ma&s;ter of the place; it appeared al&s;o that he was the only inhabitant; and, when the guard &s;oon after in|formed her their journey conluded here, her wor&s;t ap|prehen&s;ions were confirmed. The efforts &s;he made to &s;u&s;tain her &s;pirits, were no longer &s;ucce&s;sful. It &s;eem|ed that &s;he was brought hither by ruffians to a lonely hou&s;e on the &s;ea-&s;hore inhabited by a man, who had "villain" engraved in every line of his face, to be the victim of enexorable pride and an in&s;atiable de&s;ire of revenge. After con&s;idering the&s;e circum&s;tances, and the words, which had ju&s;t told her &s;he was to go no further, conviction &s;truck like lightning upon her heart; and, believing &s;he was brought hither to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, horror chilled all her frame, and her &s;en&s;es for&s;ook her.</P>
<P>On recovering, &s;he found her&s;elf &s;urrounded by the guard and the &s;tranger, and &s;he would have &s;upplica|ted for their pity, but that &s;he feared to exa&s;perate
<PB N="8" REF="032735_0298_0FF4965CD4CA9DD8">
them by betraying her &s;u&s;picions. She complained of fatigue, and reque&s;ted to be &s;hewn to her room. The men looked upon one another, he&s;itated, and then a&s;ked her to partake of the fi&s;h that was preparing. But Ellena having declined the invitation with as good a grace as &s;he could a&s;&s;ume, they con&s;ented that &s;he &s;hould withdraw. Spalatro, taking the lamp, lighted her acro&s;s the hall, to the corrodor above, where he opened the door of a chamber, in which he &s;aid &s;he was to &s;leep.</P>
<P>"Where is my bed?" &s;aid the afflicted Ellena, fear|fully as &s;he looked round.</P>
<P>"It is there&mdash;on the floor," replied Spalatro, point|ing to a mi&s;erable mattre&s;s, over which hung the tat|tered curtain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of what had once been a canopy. "If you want the lamp," he added, "I will leave it, and come for it in a minute or two."</P>
<P>"Will you not let me have a lamp for the night?" &s;he &s;aid in a &s;upplicating and timid voice.</P>
<P>"For the night!" &s;aid the man gruffly; "What! to &s;et fire to the hou&s;e."</P>
<P>Ellena &s;till entreated that he would allow her the comfort of a light.</P>
<P>"Aye, aye." replied Spalatro, with a look &s;he could not comprehend, "it would be a great comfort to you, truly! You do not know what you a&s;k."</P>
<P>"What is it that you mean?" &s;aid Ellena, eagerly; "I conjure you, in the name of our holy church, to tell me!"</P>
<P>Spalatro &s;tepped &s;uddenly back, and looked upon her with &s;urpri&s;e, but without &s;peaking.</P>
<P>"Have mercy on me!" &s;aid Ellena, greatly alarm|ed by his manner; "I am friendle&s;s, and without help!"</P>
<P>"What do you fear," &s;aid the man, recovering him|&s;elf; and then, without waiting her reply, added&mdash;
<PB N="9" REF="032735_0299_0FF46ED3DF18F3E8">
"Is it &s;uch and an unmerciful deed to take away a lamp?"</P>
<P>Ellena, who again feared to betray the extent of her &s;u&s;picions, only replied, that it would be merciful to leave it, for that her &s;pirits were low, and &s;he required light to cheer them in a new abode.</P>
<P>"We do not &s;tand upon &s;uch conceits here," repli|ed Spalatro, "we have other matters to mind. Be|&s;ides. it's the only lamp in the hou&s;e, and the compa|ny below are in darkne&s;s while I am lo&s;ing time here. I will leave it for two minutes, and no more." El|lena made a &s;ign for him to put down the lamp; and, when he left the room, &s;he heard the door barred up|on her.</P>
<P>She employed the&s;e two minutes in examining the chamber, and the po&s;&s;ibility it might afford of an e&s;|cape. It was a large apartment, unfurni&s;hed and un|&s;wept of the cobwebs of many years. The only door &s;he di&s;covered was the one, by which &s;he had entered, and the only window a lattice, which was grated. Such preparation for preventing e&s;cape &s;eemed to hint how much there might be to e&s;cape from.</P>
<P>Having examined the chamber, without finding a &s;ingle circum&s;tance to encourage hope, tried the &s;trength of the bars, which &s;he could not &s;hake, and &s;ought in vain for an in&s;ide fa&s;tening to her door, &s;he placed the lamp be&s;ide it, and awaited the return of Spalatro. In a few moments he came and offered her a cup of &s;our wine with a &s;lice of bread; which, being &s;omewhat &s;oothed by this attention, &s;he did not think proper to reject.</P>
<P>Spalatro then quitted the room, and the door was again barred. Left once more alone, &s;he tried to overcome apprehen&s;ion by prayer; and after offering up her ve&s;pers with a fervent heart, &s;he became more confiding and compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>But it was impo&s;&s;ible that &s;he could &s;o far forget the
<PB N="10" REF="032735_0300_0FF4965E5D02B260">
dangers of her &s;ituation as to &s;eek &s;leep, however wea|ried &s;he might be, while the door of her room remain|ed un&s;ecured again&s;t the intru&s;ion of the ruffians be|low; and, as &s;he had no means of fa&s;tening it, &s;he de|termined to watch during the whole night. Thus left to &s;olitude and darkne&s;s, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf upon the mattre&s;s to await the return of morning, and was &s;oon lo&s;t in &s;ad reflection; every minute occurrence of the pa&s;t day, and of the conduct of her guards, moved in review before her judgment: and, combin|ing the&s;e with the circum&s;tances of her pre&s;ent &s;itu|ation, &s;carcely a doubt as to the fate de&s;igned for her remained. It &s;eemed highly improbable that the Marche&s;a di Vivaldi had &s;ent her hither merely for impri&s;onment, &s;ince &s;he might have confined her in a convent with much le&s;s trouble; and &s;till more &s;o when Ellena con&s;idered the character of the Marche&s;a, &s;uch as &s;he had already experienced it. The appearance of this hou&s;e, and of the man who inhabited it, with the circum&s;tance of no woman be|ing found re&s;iding here, each and all of the&s;e &s;ignified, that &s;he was brought hither not for long impri&s;on|ment, but for death. Her utmo&s;t efforts for forti|tude or re&s;ignation could not overcome the cold trem|blings, the &s;ickne&s;s of heart, the faintne&s;s and univer|&s;al horror that a&s;&s;ailed her. How often, with tears of mingled terror and grief, did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he call upon Vivaldi&mdash;Vivaldi, alas! far di&s;tant&mdash;to &s;ave her; how often exclaim in agony, that &s;he &s;hould never, never &s;ee him more!</P>
<P>She was &s;pared, however, the horror of believing that he was an inhabitant of the inqui&s;ition, Hav|ing detected the impo&s;ition which had been practi&s;ed towards her&s;elf, and that &s;he was neither on the way to the Holy Office, nor conducted by per&s;ons belong|ing to it, &s;he concluded, that the whole affair of Vi|valdi's arre&s;t, had been planned by the Marche&s;a, mere|ly
<PB N="11" REF="032735_0301_0FF46EE56B8FD718">
as a pretence for confining him till &s;he &s;hould be placed beyond the reach of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She hop|ed, therefore, that he had only been &s;ent to &s;ome pri|vate re&s;idence belonging to his family, and that, when her fate was decided, he would be relea&s;ed, and &s;he be the only victim. This was the &s;ole con&s;ideration that afforded any degree of a&s;&s;uagement to her &s;uffer|ings.&mdash;</P>
<P>The people below &s;at till a late hour. She li&s;ten|ed often to their di&s;tant voices, as they were di&s;tin|gui&s;hable in the pau&s;es of the &s;urge, that broke loud and hollow on the &s;hore; and every time the creak|ing hinges of their room door moved, apprehended they were coming to her. At length it appeared they had left the apartment, or had fallen a&s;leep there, for a profound &s;tillne&s;s reigned whenever the murmur of the waves &s;unk. Doubt did not long deceive her, for, while &s;he yet li&s;tened, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed foot&s;teps a&s;cending to the corridor. She heard them approach her chamber, and &s;top at the door; &s;he heard, al&s;o, the low whi&s;pering of their voices, as they &s;eemed con|&s;ulting on what was to be done, and &s;he &s;carcely ven|tured to draw breath, while &s;he inten&s;ely attended to them. Not a word, however, di&s;tinctly reached her, till, as one of them was departing, another called out in a half whi&s;per, "It is below on the table, in my girdle; make ha&s;te." The man came back, and &s;aid &s;omething in a lower voice, to which the other replied, "&s;he &s;leeps," or Ellena was deceived by the hi&s;&s;ing con|&s;onants of &s;ome other words. He then de&s;cended the &s;tairs; and its a few minutes &s;he perceived his com|rade al&s;o pa&s;s away from the door; &s;he li&s;tened to his retreating &s;teps, till the roaring of the &s;ea was alone heard in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>Ellena's terrors were relieved only for a moment Con&s;idering the import of the words, it appeared that he man who had de&s;cended, was gone for the &s;tiletto
<PB N="12" REF="032735_0302_0FF4965FE52892C0">
of the other, &s;uch an in&s;trument being u&s;ually worn in the girdle, and from the a&s;&s;urance, "&s;he &s;leeps," he &s;eemed to fear that his words had been overheard; and &s;he li&s;tened again for their &s;teps; but they came no more.</P>
<P>Happily for Ellena,s peace, &s;he knew not that her chamber had a door, &s;o contrived as to open without &s;ound, by which a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins might enter un&s;u&s;pectedly at any hour of the night. Believing that the inhabi|tants of this hou&s;e had now retired to re&s;t, her hopes and her &s;pirits began to revive; but &s;he was yet &s;leep|le&s;s and watchful. She mea&s;ured the chamber with unequal &s;teps, often &s;tarting as the old boards &s;hook and groaned where &s;he pa&s;&s;ed; and often pau&s;ing to li&s;ten whether all was yet &s;till in the corridor. The gleam which a ri&s;ing moon threw between the bars of her window, now began to &s;hew many &s;hadowy ob|jects in the chamber, which &s;he did not recollect to have ob&s;erved while the lamp was there. More than once, &s;he fancied &s;he &s;aw &s;omething glide along towards the place where the mattre&s;s was laid, and, almo&s;t congealed with terror, &s;he &s;tood &s;till to watch it; but the illu&s;ion, if &s;uch it was, di&s;appeared where the moon-light faded, and even her fears could not give &s;hape to it beyond. Had &s;he not known that her chamber door remained &s;trongly barred, &s;he would have believed this was an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in &s;tealing to the bed where it might be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he &s;lept. Even now the thought occurred to her, and, vague as it was, had power to &s;trike an angui&s;h, almo&s;t deadly, through her heart, while &s;he con&s;idered that her immediate &s;itua|tion was nearly as perilous as the one &s;he had imaged.</P>
<P>Again &s;he li&s;tened, and &s;carcely dared to breathe; but not the lighe&s;t &s;ound occurred in the pau&s;es of the waves, and &s;he believed her&s;elf convinced that no per|&s;on except her&s;elf was in the room, That &s;he was de|ceived in this belief, appeared from her unwilling|ne&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="032735_0303_0FF46EE942BCBAB8">
to approach the mattre&s;s, while it was yet in|volved in &s;hade. Unable to overcome her reluctance, &s;he took her &s;tation at the window, till the &s;trength|ening rays &s;hould allow a clearer view of the chamber, and in &s;ome degree re&s;tore her confidence; and &s;he watched the &s;cene without as it gradually became vi|&s;ible. The moon, ri&s;ing over the ocean, &s;hewed its re&s;tle&s;s &s;urface &s;preading to the wide horizon; and the waves, which broke in foam upon the rocky beach below, retiring in long white lines far upon the wa|ters. She li&s;tened to their mea&s;ured and &s;olemn &s;ound, and, &s;omewhat &s;oothed by the &s;olitary grandeur of the view, remained at the lattice till the moon had ri&s;en high into the heavens; and even till morning began to dawn upon the &s;ea, and purple the ea&s;tern clouds.</P>
<P>Re-a&s;&s;ured by the light that now prevaded her room, &s;he returned to the mattre&s;s; where anxiety at length yielded to her wearine&s;s, and &s;he obtained a &s;hort repo&s;e.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ELLENA was awakened from profound &s;leep, by a loud noi&s;e at the door of her chamber; when &s;tart|ing from her mattre&s;s, &s;he looked around her with &s;ur|pri&s;e and di&s;may, as imperfect recollections of the pa&s;t began to gather on her mind. She di&s;tingui&s;hed the undrawing of iron bars, and the countenance of Spa|latro at her door, before &s;he had a clear remembrance of her &s;ituation&mdash;that &s;he was a pri&s;oner in a hou&s;e on a lonely &s;hore, and that this man was her jailor. Such &s;ickne&s;s of the heart returned with the&s;e convictions, &s;uch faintne&s;s and terror, that unable to &s;upport her trembling frame, &s;he &s;unk again upon the mattre&s;s, without demanding the rea&s;on of this abrupt intru|&s;ion.&mdash;</P>
<P>"I have brought you &s;ome breakfa&s;t," &s;aid Spala|tro, "if you are awake to take it; but you &s;eem to be a&s;leep yet. Surely you have had &s;leep &s;ufficient for one night; you went to re&s;t &s;oon enough."</P>
<P>Ellena made no reply, but, deeply affected with a &s;en&s;e of her &s;ituation, looked with be&s;eeching eyes at the man, who advanced, holding forth an oaten cake and ba&s;on of milk. "Where &s;hall I &s;et them?" &s;aid he," you mu&s;t need be glad of them, &s;ince you had no &s;upper."</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="032735_0305_0FF46EEAE3553A20">
Ellena thanked him, and de&s;ired he would place them on the floor, for there was neither table nor chair in the room. As he did this, &s;he was &s;truck with the expre&s;&s;ion of his countenance, which exhi|bited a &s;trange mixture of archne&s;s and malignity.&mdash;He &s;eemed congratulating him&s;elf upon his ingenuity, and anticipating &s;ome occa&s;ion of triumph; and &s;he was &s;o much intere&s;ted, that her ob&s;ervation never quitted him while he remained in the room. As his eyes accidentally met her's, he turned them away, with the abruptne&s;s of a per&s;on who is con&s;cious of evil intentions, and fears le&s;t they &s;hould be detected; nor once looked up till he ha&s;tily left the chamber, when &s;he heard the door &s;ecured as formerly.</P>
<P>The impre&s;&s;ion, his look had left on her mind, &s;o wholly engaged her in conjecture, that a con&s;iderable time elap&s;ed before &s;he remembered that he had brought the refre&s;hment &s;he &s;o much required; but, as &s;he now lifted it to her lips, a horrible &s;u&s;picion ar|re&s;ted her hand; it was not however, before &s;he had &s;wallowed a &s;mall quantity of the milk. The look of Spalatro, which occa&s;ioned her &s;urpri&s;e, had ac|companied the &s;etting down of the breakfa&s;t, and it occured to her, that poi&s;on was infu&s;ed in this liquid. She was thus compelled to refu&s;e the &s;u&s;tenance, which was become nece&s;&s;ary to her, for &s;he feared to ta&s;te even of the oaten cake, &s;ince Spalatro had offered it, but the little milk &s;he had unwarily taken, was &s;o very &s;mall that &s;he had no apprehen&s;ion concerning it.</P>
<P>The day, however, pa&s;&s;ed in terror, and almo&s;t in de&s;pondency; &s;he could neither doubt the purpo&s;e, for which &s;he had been brought hither, nor di&s;cover any po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping from her per&s;ecutors; yet that propen&s;ity to hope, which buoys up the human heart, even in the &s;evere&s;t hours of trial, &s;u&s;tained, in &s;ome degree, her fainting &s;pirits.</P>
<P>During the&s;e mi&s;erable hours of &s;olitude, and &s;u&s;|pen&s;e,
<PB N="16" REF="032735_0306_0FF4966AD30C4050">
the only alleviation to her &s;uffering aro&s;e from a belief, that Vivaldi was &s;afe, at lea&s;t from danger, though not from grief; but &s;he now under&s;tood too much of the dexterous contrivances of the Marche|&s;a, his mother, to think it was practicable for him to e&s;cape from her de&s;igns, and again re&s;tore her to liberty.</P>
<P>All day Ellena either leaned again&s;t the bars of her window, lo&s;t in reverie, while her uncon&s;cious eyes were fixed upon the ocean, who&s;e murmurs &s;he no longer heard; or &s;he li&s;tened for &s;ome &s;ound from within the hou&s;e, that might a&s;&s;i&s;t her conjectures, as to the number of per&s;ons below, or what might be pa&s;&s;ing there. The hou&s;e, however, was profoundly &s;till, except where now and then a foot&s;tep &s;aunter|ed along a di&s;tant pa&s;&s;age, or a door was heard to clo&s;e; but not the hum of a &s;ingle voice aro&s;e from the lower room, nor any &s;ymptom of there being more than one per&s;on, be&s;ide her&s;elf, in the dwelling. Though &s;he had not heard her former guards depart, it appeared certain that they were gone, and that &s;he was left alone in this place with Spalatro. What could be the purport of &s;uch a proceeding, Ellena could not i|magine; if her death was de&s;igned, it &s;eemed &s;trange that one per&s;on only &s;hould be left to the hazard of the deed, when three mu&s;t have rendered the completion of it certain. But this &s;urprize vani&s;hed, when her &s;u&s;|picion of poi&s;on returned; for it was probable, that the&s;e men had believed their &s;cheme to be already near|ly accompli&s;hed, and had abandoned her to die alone, in a chamber from whence e&s;cape was impracticable, leaving Spalatro to di&s;po&s;e of her remains. All the incongruities &s;he had &s;eparately ob&s;erved in their con|duct, &s;eemed now to harmonize and unite in one plan; and her death, de&s;igned by poi&s;on, and that poi&s;on to be conveyed in the di&s;gui&s;e of nouri&s;hment, appeared to have been the object of it, Whether it was that the
<PB N="17" REF="032735_0307_0FF49610B4113D28">
&s;trength of this conviction affected her fancy, or the cau&s;e was real, Ellena, remembering at this moment that &s;he had ta&s;ted the milk, was &s;iezed with an univer|&s;al &s;huddering, and thought &s;he felt that the poi&s;on had been &s;ufficiently potent to affect her, even in the in|con&s;iderable quantity &s;he might have taken.</P>
<P>While &s;he was thus agitated, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed foot|&s;teps loitering near the door, and attentively li&s;tening, became convinced, that &s;ome per&s;on was in the corri|dor. The &s;teps moved &s;oftly, &s;ometimes &s;topping for an in&s;tant, as if to allow time for li&s;tening, and &s;oon af|ter pa&s;&s;ed away.</P>
<P>"It is Spalatro!" &s;aid Ellena; "he believes that I have taken the poi&s;on, and he comes to li&s;ten for my dying groans! Alas! he is only come &s;omewhat too &s;oon, perhaps!"</P>
<P>As this horrible &s;upo&s;ition occurred, the &s;huddering returned with encrea&s;ed violence, and &s;he &s;unk almo&s;t fainting, on the mattre&s;s; but the fit was not of long continuance. When it gradually left her, and recollec|tion revived, &s;he perceived, however, the prudence of &s;uffering Spalatro to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he had taken the beverage he brought her, &s;ince &s;uch belief would at lea&s;t procure &s;ome delay of further &s;chemes, and every delay afforded &s;ome po&s;&s;ibility for hope to re&s;t upon. Ellena, there|fore, poured through the bars of her window, the milk which &s;he believed Spalatro had de&s;igned &s;hould be fa|tal in its con&s;equence.</P>
<P>It was evening, when &s;he again fancied foot&s;teps were lingering near her door, and the &s;u&s;picion was confirmed, when, on turning her eyes, &s;he perceived a &s;hade on the floor, underneath it, as of &s;ome per&s;on &s;ta|tioned without. Pre&s;ently the &s;hadow glided away, and at the &s;ame time &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed departing &s;teps treading cautiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>"It is he!" &s;aid Ellena; "he &s;till li&s;tens for my moans!"</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="032735_0308_0FF4966C5B930560">
This further confirmation of his de&s;igns affected her nearly as much as the fir&s;t; when anxiou&s;ly turn|ing her looks toward, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he corridor, the &s;hadow again appeared beneath the door, but &s;he heard no &s;tep. El|lena now watched it with inten&s;e &s;olicitude and expec|tation: fearing every in&s;tant that Spalatro would con|clude her doubts by entering the room. "And O! when he di&s;covers that I live," thought &s;he, "what may I not expect during the fir&s;t moments of his di&s;|appointment! what le&s;s than immediate death!"</P>
<P>The &s;hadow, after remaining a few minutes &s;tation|ary, moved a little, and then glided away as before. But it quickly returned, and a low &s;ound followed, as of &s;ome per&s;on endeavouring to unfa&s;ten bolts with|out noi&s;e. Ellena heard one bar gently undrawn, and then another; &s;he ob&s;erved the door begin to move, and then to give way, till it gradually unclo&s;ed, und the face of Spalatro pre&s;ented it&s;elf from behind it. Without immediately entering, he threw a glance round the chamber, as if he wi&s;hed to a&s;certain &s;ome circum&s;tance before he ventured further. His look was more than u&s;ually haggard as it re&s;ted upon Elle|na, who apparently repo&s;ed on her mattre&s;s.</P>
<P>Having gazed at her for an in&s;tant, he ventured to|wards the bed with quick and unequal &s;teps; his countenance expre&s;&s;ed at once impatience, alarm, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt. When he was within a few paces, Ellena rai&s;ed her&s;elf, and he &s;tarted back as if a &s;udden &s;pectre had cro&s;&s;ed him. The more than u&s;ual wildne&s;s and wanne&s;s of his looks, with the whole of his conduct, &s;eemed to confirm all her for|mer terrors; and when he roughly a&s;ked her how &s;he did, Ellena had not the &s;ufficient pre&s;ence of mind to an&s;wer that &s;he was ill. For &s;ome moments he regard|ed her with an earne&s;t and &s;ullen attention, and then a &s;ly glance of &s;crutiny, which he threw round the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> her that he was inquiring whether &s;he
<PB N="19" REF="032735_0309_0FF496123AC380B8">
had taken the poi&s;on. On perceiving that the ba&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> was empty, he lifted it from the floor, and Ellena fan|cied a gleam of &s;atisfaction pa&s;&s;ed over his vi&s;age.</P>
<P>"You have had no dinner," &s;aid he, "I forgot you; but &s;upper will &s;oon be ready; and you may walk up the beach till then, if you will,"</P>
<P>Ellena, extremly &s;urpri&s;ed and perplexed by this offer of a &s;eeming indulgence, knew not whether to accept or reject it. She &s;u&s;pected that &s;ome treachery lurked within it. The invitation appeared to be only a &s;tra|tagem to lure her to de&s;truction, and &s;he determined to decline accepting it; when again &s;he con&s;idered, that to accompli&s;h this, it was not nece&s;&s;ary to with|draw her from the chamber, where &s;he was already &s;ufficiently in the power of her per&s;ecutors. Her &s;i|tuation could not be more de&s;perate than it was at pre&s;ent, and almo&s;t any change might make it le&s;s &s;o.</P>
<P>As &s;he de&s;cended from the corridor, and pa&s;&s;ed through the lower part of the hou&s;e, no per&s;on ap|peared but her conductor; and &s;he ventured to en|quire, whether the men who had brought her hither were departed. Spalatro did not return an an&s;wer, but led the way in &s;ilence to the court, and, having pa&s;&s;ed the ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es, he pointed toward the we&s;t, and &s;aid &s;he might walk that way.</P>
<P>Ellena bent her cour&s;e towards the "many &s;ounding waves," followed at a &s;hort di&s;tance by Spalatro, and, wrapt in thought, pur&s;ued the windings of the &s;hore, &s;carcely noticing the objects around her, till, on pa&s;|&s;ing the foot of a rock, &s;he lifted her eyes to the &s;cene that unfolded beyond, and ob&s;erved &s;ome huts &s;catter|ed at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, apparently the re&s;idence of fi&s;hermen. She could ju&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h the dark &s;ails of &s;ome &s;kiffs turning the cliffs, and entering the little bay, where the hamlet margined the beach; but, though &s;he &s;aw the &s;ails lowered, as the boats approach|ed the &s;hore, they were too far off to allow the figures
<PB N="20" REF="032735_0310_0FF4966DE155EF80">
of the men to appear. To Ellena, who had believed that no human habitation, except her pri&s;on, interrupt|ed the va&s;t &s;olitudes of the&s;e fore&s;ts and &s;hores, the view of the huts, remote as they were, imparted a fee|ble hope, and even &s;omewhat of joy. She looked back, to ob&s;erve whether Spalatro was near: he was alrea|dy within a few paces; and, ca&s;ting a wi&s;tful glance forward to the remote cottages, her heart &s;unk a|gain.</P>
<P>It was a lowering evening, and the &s;ea was dark and &s;welling; the &s;creams of the &s;ea birds too, as they wheeled among the clouds, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ought their high ne&s;ts in the rocks, &s;eemed to indicate an approaching &s;torm. Ellena was not &s;o wholly engaged by &s;elfi&s;h &s;ufferings, but that &s;he could &s;ympathi&s;e with tho&s;e of others, and &s;he rejoiced that the fi&s;hermen, who&s;e boats &s;he had ob|&s;erved, had e&s;caped the threatening tempe&s;t, and were &s;afely &s;heltered in their little homes, where as they heard the loud waves break along the coa&s;t, they could look with keener plea&s;ure upon the &s;ocial circle, and the warm comforts around them. From &s;uch con&s;idera|tions, however, &s;he returned again to a &s;en&s;e of her own forlorn and friendle&s;s &s;ituation.</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid &s;he, "I have no longer a home, a cir|cle to &s;mile welcomes upon me! I have no longer even one friend to &s;upport, to re&s;cue me! I&mdash;a mi&s;erable wanderer on a di&s;tant &s;hore! tracked, per|haps, by the foot&s;teps of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who at this in|&s;tant eyes his victim with &s;ilent watchfulne&s;s, and awaits the moment of opportunity to &s;acrifice her!"</P>
<P>Ellena &s;huddered as &s;he &s;aid this, and turned again to ob&s;erve whether Spalatro was near. He was not within view, and while &s;he wondered, and congratu|lated her&s;elf on a po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping, &s;he perceived a Monk walking &s;ilently beneath the dark rocks that overbrowed the beach, His black garments were folded round him; his face was inclined toward the
<PB N="21" REF="032735_0311_0FF4961D787E72B8">
ground, and he had the air of a man in deep medita|tion.</P>
<P>"His, no doubt, are worthy mu&s;ings!" &s;aid Elle|na, as &s;he ob&s;erved him, with mingled hope and &s;ur|prize. "I may addre&s;s my&s;elf, without fear, to one-of his order. It is probably as much his wi&s;h, as it is his duty, to &s;uccour the unfortunate. Who could have hoped to find on this &s;eque&s;tered &s;hore &s;o &s;acred a pro|tector! his convent cannot be far off!"</P>
<P>He approached, his face &s;till bent towards the ground, and Ellena advanced &s;lowly, and with trem|bling &s;teps, to meet him. As he drew near, he view|ed her a&s;kance, without lifting his head; but &s;he per|ceived his large eyes looking from under the &s;hade of his cowl, and the upper part of his peculiar counte|nance. Her confidence in his protection began to fail, and &s;he faultered, unable to &s;peak, and &s;carcely daring to meet his eyes. The Monk &s;talked pa&s;t her in &s;ilence, the lower part of his vi&s;age &s;till muffled in his drapery, and, as he pa&s;&s;ed her, looked neither with curio&s;ity, nor &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Ellena pau&s;ed, and determined, when he &s;hould be at &s;ome di&s;tance, to endeavour to make her way to the hamlet, and throw her&s;elf upon the humanity of its in habitants, rather than &s;olicit the pity of this forbidding &s;tranger. But in the next moment &s;he heard a &s;tep behind her, and, on turning, &s;aw the Monk again ap|proaching. He &s;talked by as before, &s;urveying her, however with a &s;ly and &s;crutinizing glance from the corners of his eyes. His air and countenance were equally repul&s;ive, and &s;till Ellena could not &s;ummon cou|rage enough to attempt engaging his compa&s;&s;ion; but &s;hrunk as from an enemy.&mdash;There was &s;omething al&s;o terrific in the &s;ilent &s;talk of &s;o gigantic a form; it an|nounced both power and treachery. He pa&s;&s;ed &s;low|ly on to &s;ome di&s;tance, and di&s;appeared among the rocks.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="032735_0312_0FF496779CECCCE8">
Ellena turned once more with an intention of ha&s;t|ening towards the di&s;tant hamlet, before Spalatro &s;hould ob&s;erve her, who&s;e &s;trange ab&s;ence &s;he had &s;carcely time to wonder at; but &s;he had not proceed|ed far, when &s;uddenly &s;he perceived the Monk again at her &s;houlder. She &s;tarted, and almo&s;t &s;hrieked; while he regarded her with more attention than before. He pau&s;ed a moment, and &s;eemed to he&s;itate; after which he again pa&s;&s;ed on in &s;ilence. The di&s;tre&s;s of Ellena encrea&s;ed; he was gone the way &s;he had de|&s;igned to run, and &s;he feared almo&s;t equally to follow him, and to return to her pri&s;on. Pre&s;ently he turn|ed, and pa&s;&s;ed her again, and Ellena ha&s;tened forward. But, when fearful of being pur&s;ued, &s;he again looked back, &s;he ob&s;erved him conver&s;ing with Spalatro. They appeared to be in con&s;ultation, while they &s;low|ly advanced, till, probably ob&s;erving her rapid pro|gre&s;s, Spalatro called on her to &s;top, in a voice that echoed among all the rocks. It was a voice, which would not be di&s;obeyed. She looked hopele&s;sly at the &s;till di&s;tant cottages, and &s;lackened her &s;teps.&mdash;Pre|&s;ently the Monk again pa&s;&s;ed before her, and Spalatro had again di&s;appeared. The frown with which the former now regarded Ellena, was &s;o terrific, that &s;he &s;hrunk trembling back, though &s;he knew him not for her per&s;ecutor, &s;ince &s;he had never con&s;ciou&s;ly &s;een Schedoni. He was agitated, and his look became darker.</P>
<P>"Whither go you?" &s;aid he, in a voice that was &s;tifled by emotion.</P>
<P>"Who is it, father, that a&s;ks the que&s;tion?" &s;aid Ellena, endeavouring to appear compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Whither go you, and who are you!" repeated the Monk more &s;ternly.</P>
<P>"I am an unhappy orphan," replied Ellena, &s;igh|ing deeply; "If you are, as your habit denotes, a friend to the charities, you will regard me with com|pa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="032735_0313_0FF4961F1AA85740">
Schedoni was &s;ilent, and then &s;aid&mdash;"Who and what is that you fear?"</P>
<P>"I fear even for my life," replied Ellena, with he&s;i|tation. She ob&s;erved a darker &s;hade pa&s;s over his countenance. "For your life!" &s;aid he, with apparent &s;urpri&s;e, "who is there that would think it worth the taking."</P>
<P>Ellena was &s;truck with the&s;e words.</P>
<P>"Poor in&s;ect!" added Schedoni, "who would cru&s;h thee?"</P>
<P>Ellena made no reply; &s;he remained with her eyes fixed in amazement upon his face. There was &s;ome|thing in his manner of pronouncing this, yet more ex|traordinary than in the words them&s;elves. Alarmed by his manner, and awed by the encrea&s;ing gloom, and &s;welling &s;urge, that broke in thunder on the beach, &s;he at length turned away, and again walked towards the hamlet which was yet very remote.</P>
<P>He &s;oon overtook her; when rudely &s;eizing her arm, and gazing earne&s;tly on her face, "Who is it, that you fear?" &s;aid he, "&s;ay who!"</P>
<P>"That is more then I dare &s;ay," replied Ellena, &s;carcely able to &s;u&s;tain her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Hah! is it even &s;o!" &s;aid the Monk, with en|crea&s;ed emotion. His vi&s;age now became &s;o terrible, that Ellena &s;truggled to liberate her arm, and &s;uppli|cated that he would not detain her. He was &s;ilent, and &s;till gazed upon her, but his eyes, when &s;he had cea&s;ed to &s;truggle, a&s;&s;umed that fixt and vacant glare of a man, who&s;e thoughts have retired within them|&s;elves, and who is no longer con&s;cious to &s;urrounding objects.</P>
<P>"I be&s;eech you to relea&s;e me!" repeated Ellena, "it is late, and I am far from home."</P>
<P>"That is true," muttered Schedoni, &s;till gra&s;ping her arm, and &s;eeming to reply to his own thoughts rather than to her words,&mdash;"that is very true."</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="032735_0314_0FF496792328BF68">
"The evening is clo&s;ing fa&s;t," continued Ellena, "and I &s;hall be overtaken by the &s;torm."</P>
<P>Schedoni &s;till mu&s;ed, and then muttered&mdash;"The &s;torm, &s;ay you? Why ay, let it come."</P>
<P>As he &s;poke, he &s;uffered her arm to drop, but &s;till held it, and walked &s;lowly towards the hou&s;e. Elle|na, thus compelled to accompany him, and yet more alarmed both by his looks, his incoherent an&s;wers, and his approach to her pri&s;on, renewed her &s;upplications and her efforts for liberty, in a voice of piercing di&s;|tre&s;s, adding "I am far from home, father; night is coming on. See how the rocks darken! I am far from home, and &s;hall be waited for."</P>
<P>"That is fal&s;e!" &s;aid Schedoni, with empha&s;is; "and you know it to be &s;o."</P>
<P>"Alas! I do," replied Ellena, with mingled &s;hame and grief, "I have no friends to wait for me!"</P>
<P>"What do tho&s;e de&s;erve, who deliberately utter fal&s;ehoods," continued the Monk, "who deceive, and flatter young men to their de&s;truction?"</P>
<P>"Father!" exclaimed the a&s;toni&s;hed Ellena.</P>
<P>"Who di&s;turb the peace of families&mdash;who tre|pan with wanton arts, the heirs of noble hou&s;es&mdash;who&mdash;hah! what do &s;uch de&s;erve!"</P>
<P>Overcome with a&s;toni&s;hment and terror, Ellena remained &s;ilent. She now under&s;tood that Schedoni, &s;o far from being likely to prove a protector, was an agent of her wor&s;t, and as &s;he had believed, her only enemy; and an apprehen&s;ion of the immediate and terrible vengeance, which &s;uch an agent &s;eemed wil|ling to accompli&s;h, &s;ubdued her &s;en&s;es; &s;he tottered, and &s;unk upon the beach. The weight, which &s;train|ed the arm Schedoni held, called his attention to her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>As he gazed upon her helple&s;s and faded form, he became agitated. He quitted it, and traver&s;ed the beach in &s;hort turns, and with ha&s;ty &s;teps; came back

<P>"We are ob&s;erved," &s;aid Bonarmo, at length, "and are even now, perhaps, almo&s;t beneath the poniard of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in: let us be gone.</P>
<P>"O that my heart were as &s;ecure from the darts of love, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of my peace," exclaimed Vivaldi, "as yours is from tho&s;e of bravos! My friend, you have little to intere&s;t you, &s;ince your thoughts have &s;o much lei&s;ure for apprehen&s;ion."</P>
<P>"My fear is that of prudence, not of weakne&s;s," retorted Bonarmo, with acrimony; "you will find, perhaps, that I have none, when you mo&s;t wi&s;h me to po&s;&s;e&s;s it."</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand you," replied Vivaldi "let us fini&s;h this bu&s;ine&s;s, and you &s;hall receive reparation, &s;ince you beleive your&s;elf injured: I am as anxious to re|pair an offence, as jealous of receiving one."</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Bonarmo, "you would repair the injury you have done your friend with his blood.</P>
<P>"Oh! never, never!" &s;aid Vivaldi, falling on his neck. "Forgive my ha&s;ty violence; allow for the di&s;traction of my mind."</P>
<P>Bonarmo returned the imbrace, "It is enough," &s;aid he; "no more, no more! I hold again my friend to my heart."</P>
<P>While this conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed, they had quitted the orangery, and reached the walls of the villa, where they took their &s;tation under a balcony that overhung the lattice, through which Vivaldi had &s;een Ellena on the preceding night.

<P>Vivaldi's voice was a fine tenor, and the &s;ame &s;u&s;|ceptibility, which made him pa&s;&s;ionately fond of mu|&s;ic, taught him to modulate its cadence with exqui|&s;ite delicacy, and to give his empha&s;is with the mo&s;t

No &s;ounds &s;tole on the &s;tillne&s;s of the night, except tho&s;e of the &s;erenade, nor did any light from within the villa break upon the ob&s;curity without; once, indeed, in a pau&s;e of the in&s;truments Bonarmo fancied he di&s;tingui&s;hed voices near him, as of per&s;ons who feared to be heard, and he li&s;tened at|tentively, but without a&s;certaining the truth. Some|times they &s;eemed to &s;ound heavily in his ear, and then a death-like &s;ilence prevailed. Vivaldi affirmed the &s;ound to be nothing more than the confu&s;ed murmur of the di&s;tant multitude on the &s;hore, but Bonarmo was not thus ea&s;ily convinced.</P>
<P>The mu&s;icians, un&s;ucce&s;sful in their fir&s;t endeavour to attract attention, removed to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the building, and placed them&s;elves in front of the portico, but with as little &s;ucce&s;s, and, after having exerci&s;ed their powers of harmony and of patience for above an hour, they re&s;igned all further effort to win upon the obdurate Ellena. Vivaldi, notwith|&s;tanding the feeblene&s;s of his fir&s;t hope of &s;eeing her, now &s;uffered an agony of di&s;appointment; and Bo|narmo, alarmed for the con&s;equence of his de&s;pair, was as anxious to per&s;uade him that he had no rival, as he had lately been pertinacious in affirming that he had one.</P>
<P>At length they left the gardens, Vivaldi, prote&s;t|ing that he would not re&s;t until he had di&s;covered the &s;tranger, who &s;o wantonly de&s;troyed his peace, and had compelled him to explain his ambiguous warn|ings; and Bonarmo remon&s;trating on the imprudence
<PB N="27" REF="032735_0317_0FF4962229C0B498">
and difficulty of the &s;earch, and repre&s;enting that &s;uch conduct would probably be the means of &s;preading a report of his attachment, where mo&s;t he dreaded it &s;hould be known,</P>
<P>Vivaldi refu&s;ed to yeild to remon&s;trance or con&s;i|derations of any kind. "We &s;hall &s;ee," &s;aid he, "whether this demon in the garb of a monk, will haunt me again at the accu&s;tomed place; if he does, he &s;hall not e&s;cape my gra&s;p; and if he does not, I will watch as vigilantly for his return, as he &s;eems to have done for mine. I will lurk in the &s;hade of the ruin, and wait for him, though it be till death!"</P>
<P>Bonarmo was particularly &s;truck by the vehemence which he pronounced the la&s;t words, but he no longer oppo&s;ed his purpo&s;e, and only bade him con&s;ider whe|ther he was well armed, "For" he added, "you may have need of arms there, though you had no u&s;e for them at the villa Altieri. Remember that the &s;trang|er told you that your &s;teps were watched."</P>
<P>"I have my &s;word," replied Vivaldi, "and the dagger which I u&s;ually wear; but I ought to enquire what are your weapons of defence."</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h!" &s;aid Bornarmo, as they turned the foot of a rock that overhung the road," we are approach|ing the &s;pot; yonder is the arch!" It appeared du&s;ki|ly in the per&s;pective, &s;u&s;pended between two cliffs, where the road wound from &s;ight, on one of which were the ruins of the Roman fort it belonged to, and on the other, &s;hadowing pines, and thickets of oak that tufted the rock to its ba&s;e.</P>
<P>They proceeded in &s;ilence, treading lightly, and of|ten throwing a &s;u&s;picious glance around, expecting every in&s;tant that the monk would &s;teal out upon them from &s;ome rece&s;s of the cliffs. But they pa&s;&s;ed on un|mole&s;ted to the arch-way. "We are here before him, however," &s;aid Vivaldi as they entered the dark|ne&s;s, "Speak low&punc; my friend," &s;aid Bonarmo, "o|thers
<PB N="28" REF="032735_0318_0FF4967C3305A928">
be&s;ides our&s;elves may be &s;hrouded in this ob&s;cu|rity. I like not the place."</P>
<P>"Who but our&s;elves would chu&s;e &s;o di&s;mal a re|treat?" whi&s;pered Vivaldi, "unle&s;s indeed, it were banditti; the &s;avagene&s;s of the &s;pot would, in truth, &s;uit their humour, and it &s;uits well al&s;o with my own."</P>
<P>"It would &s;uit their purpo&s;e too, as well as their humour," ob&s;erved Bonarmo. "Let us remove from this deep &s;hade, into the more open road, where we can as clo&s;ely ob&s;erve who pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Vivaldi objected that in the road they might them|&s;elves be ob&s;erved, "and if we are &s;een by my un|known tormentor, our de&s;ign is defeated, for he comes upon us &s;uddenly, or not at all, le&s;t we &s;hould be pre|pared to detain him.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, as he &s;aid this, took his &s;tation within the thicke&s;t gloom of the arch, which was of con&s;iderable depth, and near a flight of &s;teps that was cut in the rock, and a&s;cended to the fortre&s;s. His friend &s;tep|ped clo&s;e to his &s;ide. After a pau&s;e of &s;ilence, du|ring which Bonarmo was meditating, and Vivaldi was impatiently watching, "do you really believe," &s;aid the former, "that any effort to detain him would be effectual? He glided pa&s;t me with a &s;trange faci|lity, it was &s;urely more than human!"</P>
<P>"What is it you mean?" enquired Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Why, I mean that I could be &s;uper&s;titious. This place, perhaps, infects my mind with congenial gloom, for I find that, at this moment, there is &s;carce|ly a &s;uper&s;tition too dark for my credulity."</P>
<P>Vivaldi &s;miled. "And you mu&s;t allow," added Bonarmo, "that he has appeared under circum&s;tan|ces &s;omewhat extraordinary. How &s;hould he know your name, by which you &s;ay he addre&s;&s;ed you at the fir&s;t meeting? How &s;hould he know from whence you came, or whether you de&s;igned to return? By what magic could he become acquainted with your plans?"</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="032735_0319_0FF4962C8AADF688">
"Nor am I certain that he is acquainted with them," ob&s;erved Vivaldi; "but if he is, there was no nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uperhuman means to obtain &s;uch knowledge."</P>
<P>"The re&s;ult of this evening &s;urely ought to con|vince you that he is acquainted with your de&s;igns," &s;aid Bonarmo. Do you believe it po&s;&s;ible that Elle|na could have been in&s;en&s;ible to your attentions, if her heart had not been pre-engaged, and that &s;he would not have &s;hewn her&s;elf at a lattice?"</P>
<P>"You do not know Ellena," replied Vivaldi, "and therefore I once more pardon you the que&s;tion. Yet had &s;he been di&s;po&s;ed to accept my addre&s;&s;es, &s;urely &s;ome &s;ign of approbation,"&mdash;he checked him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"The &s;tranger warned you not to go to the villa Altieri," re&s;umed Bonarmo, "he &s;eemed to anticipate the reception which awaited you, and to know a dan|ger, which hitherto you have happily e&s;caped."</P>
<P>"Yes, he anticipated too well that reception," &s;aid Vivaldi, lo&s;ing, his prudence in pa&s;&s;ionate exclamati|on; "and he is him&s;elf, perhaps, the rival, whom he has taught me to &s;u&s;pect. He has a&s;&s;umed a di&s;gui&s;e only the more effectually to impo&s;e upon my credulity, and do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me from addre&s;&s;ing Ellena. And &s;hall I tamely lie in wait for his approach? Shall I lurk like a guilty a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in for his rival?"</P>
<P>"For heaven's &s;ake!" &s;aid Bonarmo, "moderate the&s;e tran&s;ports; con&s;ider where you are. This &s;ur|mi&s;e of yours is in the highe&s;t degree improbable." He gave his rea&s;ons for thinking &s;o, and the&s;e convin|ced Vivaldi, who was prevailed upon to be once more patient.</P>
<P>They had remained watchful and &s;till for a con&s;i|derable time, when Bonarmo &s;aw a per&s;on approach the end of the arch-way neare&s;t to Altieri. He heard no &s;tep, but he perceived a &s;hadowy figure &s;ta|tion it&s;elf at the entrance of the arch, where the twi|light
<PB N="30" REF="032735_0320_0FF49687556ED8D0">
of this brilliant climate was, for a few paces, ad|mitted. Vivaldi's eyes were fixed on the road lead|ing towards Naples, and he, therefore, did not perceive the object of Bonarmo's attention, who, fearful of his friend's precipitancy, forbore to point out immediate|ly what he ob&s;erved, judging it more prudent to watch the motions of this unknown per&s;on, that he might a&s;certain whether it really were the monk. The &s;ize of the figure, and the dark drapery in which it &s;eem|ed wrapt, induced him, at length, to believe that this was the expected &s;tranger; and he &s;eized Vivaldi's arm to direct his attention to him, when the form glided forward di&s;appeared in the gloom, but not be|fore Vivaldi had under&s;tood the occa&s;ion of his friend's ge&s;ture and &s;ignificant &s;ilence. They heard no foot|&s;tep pa&s;s them, and, being convinced that this per&s;on, whatever he was, had not left the arch-way, they kept their &s;tation in watchful &s;tillne&s;s. Pre&s;ently they heard a ru&s;tling, as of garments, near them, and Vi|valdi, unable longer to command his patience, &s;tarted from his concealment, and with arms extended to prevent any one from e&s;caping, demanded who was there.</P>
<P>The &s;ound cea&s;ed, and no reply was made. Bonarmo drew his &s;word, prote&s;ting he would &s;tab the air till he found the per&s;on who lurked there; but if the latter would di&s;cover him&s;elf, he &s;hould receive no injury. This a&s;&s;urance Vivaldi confirmed by his promi&s;e. Still no an&s;wer was returned; but as they li&s;tened for a voice, they thought &s;omething pa&s;&s;ed them, and the avenue was not narrow enough to have prevent|ed &s;uch a circum&s;tance. Vivaldi ru&s;hed forward, but did not perceive any per&s;on i&s;&s;ue from the arch in|to the highway, where the &s;tronger twilight mu&s;t have di&s;covered him.</P>
<P>"Somebody certainly pa&s;&s;ed," whi&s;pered Bonar|mo, "and I think I hear a &s;ound from yonder &s;teps, that lead to the fortre&s;s."</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="032735_0321_0FF4962E12399E70">
"Let us follow," cried Vivaldi, and he began to a&s;cend.</P>
<P>"Stop, for heaven's &s;ake &s;top!" &s;aid Bonarmo; "con&s;ider what you are about! Do not brave the ut|ter darkne&s;s of the&s;e ruins; do not pur&s;ue the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in to his den!"</P>
<P>"It is the monk him&s;elf! exclaimed Vivaldi, &s;till a&s;cending; "he &s;hall not e&s;cape me!"</P>
<P>Bonarmo pau&s;ed a moment at the foot of the &s;teps, and his friend di&s;appeared; he he&s;itated what to do, till a&s;hamed of &s;uffering him to encounter danger a|lone, he &s;prang to the flight, and not without difficul|ty &s;urmounted the rugged &s;teps.</P>
<P>Having reached the &s;ummit of the rock, he found him&s;elf on a terrace, that ran along the top of the arch|way and had once been fortified; this, cro&s;&s;ing the road, commanded the defile each way. Some remains of ma&s;&s;y walls, that &s;till exhibited loops for archers, were all that now hinted of its former u&s;e. It led to a watch-tower almo&s;t concealed in thick pines, that crowned the oppo&s;ite cliff, and had thus &s;erved not only for a &s;trong battery over the road, but connecting the oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the defile, had formed a line of communication between the fort and this out-po&s;t.</P>
<P>Bonarmo looked round in vain for his friend, and the echoes of his own voice only, among the rocks, replied to his repeated calls. After &s;ome he&s;itation whether to enter the walls of the main building, or to cro&s;s to the watch-tower, he determined on the former, and entered a rugged area, the walls of which, following the declivities of the precipice, could &s;carce|ly now be traced. The citadel, a round tower, of maje&s;tic &s;trength, with &s;ome Roman arches &s;cattered near, was all that remained of this once important fortre&s;s; except, indeed, a ma&s;s of ruins near the edge of the cliff, the con&s;truction of which made it difficult to gue&s;s for what purpo&s;e it had been de&s;igned.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="032735_0322_0FF49688DE8B9480">
Bonarmo entered the immen&s;e walls of the citadel, but the utter darkne&s;s within checked his progre&s;s, and, contenting him&s;elf with calling loudly on Vi|valdi, he returned to the open air.</P>
<P>As he approached the ma&s;s of ruins, who&s;e &s;in|gular form had intere&s;ted his curio&s;ity, he thought he di&s;tingui&s;hed the low accents of a human voice, and while he li&s;tened in anxiety, a per&s;on ru&s;hed forth from a door-way of the ruin, carrying a drawn &s;word. It was Vivaldi him&s;elf. Bonarmo &s;prang to meet him; he was pale and breathle&s;s, and &s;ome moments elap&s;ed before he could &s;peak, or appeared to hear the repeated enquiries of his friend.</P>
<P>"Let us go," &s;aid Vivaldi, "let us leave this place."</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t willingly," replied Bonarmo, "but where have you been, and who have you &s;een, that you are thus affected?"</P>
<P>"A&s;k me no more que&s;tions, let us go," repeated Vivaldi.</P>
<P>They de&s;cended the rock together, and when having reached the arch way, Bonarmo enquired, half &s;por|tively, whether they &s;hould remain any longer on the watch, his friend an&s;wered, "No!" with an empha&s;is that &s;tartled him. They pa&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily on the way to Naples, Bonarmo repeating enquiries which Vivaldi &s;eemed reluctant to &s;atisfy, and wondering no le&s;s at the cau&s;e of this &s;udden re&s;erve, than anxious to know whom he had &s;een.</P>
<P>"It was the monk, then," &s;aid Bonarmo; "you &s;ecured him at la&s;t?"</P>
<P>"I know not what to think," replied Vivaldi, "I am more perplexed than ever."</P>
<P>"He e&s;caped you then?"</P>
<P>"We will &s;peak of this in future," &s;aid Vivaldi; "but be it as it may, the bu&s;ine&s;s re&s;ts not here. I will return in the night of to-morrow with a torch; dare you venture your&s;elf with me?"</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="032735_0323_0FF4962F9B0ABAC0">
"I know not," replied Bonarmo, "whether I ought to do &s;o, &s;ince I am not informed for what purpo&s;e?"</P>
<P>"I will not pre&s;s you to go," &s;aid Vivaldi; my purpo&s;e is already known to you."</P>
<P>"Have you really failed to di&s;cover the &s;tranger&mdash;have you &s;till doubts concerning the per&s;on you pur|&s;ued?"</P>
<P>I have doubts, which to-morrow night, I hope will di&s;&s;ipate."</P>
<P>"This is very &s;trange!" &s;aid Bonarmo, "It was but now that I witne&s;&s;ed the horror, with which you left this fortre&s;s of Puluzzi, and already you &s;peak of returning to it!. And why at night&mdash;why not in the day, when le&s;s danger would be&s;et you?"</P>
<P>"I know not as to that," replied Vivaldi, "you are to ob&s;erve that day-light never pierces within the rece&s;s, to which I penetrated; we mu&s;t &s;earch the place with torches at what&s;oever hour we would ex|amine it."</P>
<P>"Since this is nece&s;&s;ary," &s;aid Bonarmo, "how happens it that you found your way in total darkne&s;s?"</P>
<P>"I was too much engaged to know how; I was led on, as by an invi&s;ible hand."</P>
<P>"We mu&s;t, notwith&s;tanding," ob&s;erved Banarmo&punc; "go in day-time, if not by day-light, provided I ac|company you. It would be little le&s;s than in&s;anity to go twice to a place, which is probably infe&s;ted with robbers, and at their own hour of midnight."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall watch again in the accu&s;tomed place," re|plied Vivaldi, "before I u&s;e my la&s;t re&s;ource, and this cannot be done during the day. Be&s;ides, it is nece&s;|&s;ary that I &s;hould go at a particular hour, the hour when the monk has u&s;ually appeared.</P>
<P>"He did e&s;cape you, then?" &s;aid Bonarmo, "and you are &s;till ignorant concerning who he is?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi rejoined only with an enquiry whether his friend would accompany him. "If not," he added&punc; "I mu&s;t hope to find another companion."</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="032735_0324_0FF4968A633F50C0">
Bonarmo &s;aid, that he mu&s;t con&s;ider of the propo&s;al, and would acquaint him with his determination be|fore the following evening.</P>

He opened it, and proceeded along the &s;ilent pa&s;&s;ages, towards the private &s;tair-ca&s;e, often pau&s;ing to li&s;ten and then &s;tepping more lightly;&mdash;the terrific Schedoni, in this moment of meditative guilt, feared even the feeble Ellena. At the foot of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, he again &s;topped to li&s;ten. "Do you here any thing?"' &s;aid he in a whi&s;per.</P>
<P>"I hear only the &s;ea," replied the man.</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h! it is &s;omething more!" &s;aid Schedoni; "that is the murmur of voices!"</P>
<P>They were &s;ilent. After a pau&s;e of &s;ome length, "It is, perhaps, the voice of the &s;pectres I told you of, Signor," &s;aid Spalatro, with a &s;neer. "Give me the dagger," &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>Spalatro, in&s;tead of obeying, now gra&s;ped the arms of the Confe&s;&s;or, who, looking at him for an explana|tion of this extraordinary action, was &s;till more &s;ur|pri&s;ed to ob&s;erve the palene&s;s and horror of his coun|tenance. His &s;tarting eyes &s;eemed to follow &s;ome ob|ject along the pa&s;&s;age, and Schedoni, who began to partake of his feelings, looked forward to di&s;cover what occa&s;ioned this di&s;may, but could not perceive any thing that ju&s;tified it. "What is it you fear?" &s;aid he at length.</P>
<P>Spaltro's eyes were &s;till moving in horror. "Do you &s;ee nothing!" &s;aid he pointing. Schedoni look|ed again, but did not di&s;tingui&s;h any object in the re|mote gloom of the pa&s;&s;age, whether Spalatro's &s;ight was now fixed.</P>
<P>"Come, come," &s;aid he, a&s;hamed of his own weak|ne&s;s, "this is not a moment for &s;uch fancies. Awake from this idle dream."</P>
<P>Spalatro withdrew his eyes, but they retained all their wildne&s;s "It was no dream," &s;aid he in the voice of a man who is exhau&s;ted by pain, and begins to breathe &s;omewhat more freely again "I &s;aw it as plainly as I now &s;ee you."</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="032735_0328_0FF496964FA64D48">
"Dotard! what did you &s;ee!" enquired the Con|fe&s;&s;or.</P>

<P>"What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it&s;elf? repeated Schedoni."</P>
<P>"And then it beckoned&mdash;yes it beckoned me, with that blood-&s;tained finger! and glided away down the pa&s;&s;age &s;till beckoning&mdash;till it was lo&s;t in the darkne&s;s."</P>
<P>"This is very frenzy!" &s;aid Schedoni, exce&s;&s;ively agitated. "Arou&s;e your&s;elf, and be a man!</P>
<P>"Frenzy! would it were, Signor. I &s;aw that dreadful hand&mdash;I &s;ee it now&mdash;it is there again!&mdash;there!"</P>
<P>Schedoni, &s;hocked, embarra&s;&s;ed, and once more in|fected with the &s;trange emotions of Spalatro, looked forward, expecting to di&s;cover &s;ome terrific object, but, &s;till nothing was vi&s;ible to him, and he &s;oon re|covered him&s;elf &s;ufficiently to endeavour to appea&s;e the fancy of this con&s;cience-&s;truck ruffian. But Spalatro was in&s;en&s;ible to all he could urge, and the Confe&s;&s;or, fearing that his voice, though weak and &s;tifled, would awaken Ellena, tried to withdraw him from the &s;pot, to the apartment they had quitted.</P>
<P>"The wealth of San Loretto, &s;hould not make me go that way, Signor," replied he, &s;huddering&mdash;"that was they way <HI>it</HI> beckoned, it vani&s;hed that way!"</P>
<P>Every emotion now yielded with Schedoni, to that of apprehen&s;ion, le&s;t Ellena, being awakened, &s;hould make his ta&s;k more horrid by a &s;truggle, and his em|barra&s;&s;ment encrea&s;ed at each in&s;tant, for neither com|mand, menace or entreaty could prevail with Spala|tro to retire, till the Monk luckily remembered a door which opened beyond the &s;tair-ca&s;e, would conduct them by another way to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the hou&s;e. The man con&s;ented &s;o to depart, when Schedoni, un|locking a &s;uit of rooms, of which he had always kept
<PB N="39" REF="032735_0329_0FF4963E4DD13B40">
the keys, they pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ilence through an ex|tent of de&s;olate chambers, till they reached the one which they had lately left.</P>
<P>Here, relieved from apprehen&s;ion re&s;pecting Ellena, the Confe&s;&s;or expo&s;tulated more freely with Spalatro; but neither argument nor menace could prevail, and the man per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to return to the &s;tair-ca&s;e, though prote&s;ting, at the &s;ame time, that he would not remain alone in any part of the hou&s;e, till the wine, with which the Confe&s;&s;or abundantly &s;up|plied him, began to overcome the terrors of his ima|gination. At length, his courage was &s;o much re|animated, that he con&s;ented to re&s;ume his &s;tation, and await at the foot of the &s;tairs the accompli&s;hment of Schedoni's dreadful errand, with which agreement they returned thither by the way they had lately pa&s;&s;|ed. The wine, with which Schedoni al&s;o had found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trengthen his own re&s;olution, did not &s;ecure him from &s;evere emotion, when he found him|&s;elf again near Ellena; but he made a &s;trenous effort for &s;elf &s;ubjection, as he demanded the dagger of Spa|latro.</P>
<P>"You have it, already, Signor," replied the man.</P>
<P>"True," &s;aid the Monk;" a&s;cend &s;oftly, or our &s;teps may awaken her."</P>
<P>"You &s;aid I was to wait at the foot of the &s;tairs, Signor, while you"&mdash;</P>
<P>"True, true, true!" muttered the Confe&s;&s;or, and had begun to a&s;cend, when his attendant de&s;ired him to &s;top. "You are going in darkne&s;s, Signor, you have forgotten the lamp. I have another here."</P>
<P>Schedoni took it angrily, without &s;peaking, and was again a&s;cending, when he he&s;itated, and once more pau&s;ed. "The glare will di&s;turb her," thought he, "it is better to go in darkne&s;s&mdash;Yet&mdash;"He con&s;idered, that he could nor &s;trike with certainty without light to direct his hand, and he kept the

<P>"I will obey, Signor, if you, on your part, will promi&s;e not to give the &s;ignal till all is over."</P>
<P>"I do promi&s;e," replied Schedoni. "No more!"</P>
<P>Again he a&s;cended, nor &s;topped till he reached El|lena's door, where he li&s;tened for a &s;ound; but all was as &s;ilent as if death already reigned in the chamber. This door was from long di&s;u&s;e, difficult to be opened; formerly it would have yielded without &s;ound, but now Schedoni was fearful of noi&s;e from every effort he made to move it. After &s;ome difficulty, however, it gave way, and he perceived, by the &s;tillne&s;s within the apartment, that he had not di&s;turbed Ellena. He &s;haded the lamp with the door for a moment, while he threw an enquiring glance forward, and when he did venture farther, held part of his dark drapery before the light to prevent the rays from &s;preading through the room.</P>
<P>As he approached the bed, her gentle breathings informed him that &s;he &s;till &s;lept, and the next moment he was at her&s;ide. She lay in deep and peaceful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lum|ber, and &s;eemed to have thrown her&s;elf upon the mat|tre&s;s, after having been wearied by her griefs; for, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pre&s;&s;ed heavily upon her eyes, their lids were yet wet with tears.</P>
<P>While Schedoni gazed for a moment upon her in|nocent countenance, a faint &s;mile &s;tole over it. He &s;tep|ped back." She &s;miles in her murderer's face!" &s;aid he, &s;huddering, "I mu&s;t be &s;peedy."</P>
<P>He &s;earched for the dagger, and it was &s;ome time before his trembling hand could di&s;engage it from the folds of his garment; but, having done &s;o, he again drew near, and prepared to &s;trike. Her dre&s;s per|plexed him; it would interrupt the blow, and he &s;top|ped to examine whether he could turn her robe a&s;id
<PB N="41" REF="032735_0331_0FF4963FD2C05E88">
without waking her. As the light pa&s;&s;ed over her face, he perceived that the &s;mile had vani&s;hed&mdash;the vi&s;ions of her &s;leep were changed, for tears &s;tole from beneath her eye lids, and her features &s;uffered a &s;light convul&s;ion. She &s;poke! Schedoni, apprehending that the light had di&s;turbed her, &s;uddenly drew back, and again irre&s;olute, &s;haded the lamp and concealed him|&s;elf behind the curtain, while he li&s;tened. But her words were inward and indi&s;tinct, and convinced him that &s;he &s;till &s;lumbered.</P>
<P>His agitation and repugnance to &s;trike, encrea&s;ed with every moment of delay, and as often as he pre|pared to plunge the poignard in her bo&s;om, a &s;hudder|ing horror re&s;trained him. A&s;toni&s;hed at his own feelings, and indignant at what he termed a da&s;tardly weakne&s;s, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to argue with him&s;elf, and his rapid thoughts &s;aid, "Do I not feel the nece&s;|&s;ity of this act? Does not what is dearer to me than exi&s;tence&mdash;does not my con&s;equence depend on the ex|ecution of it? Is &s;he not al&s;o beloved by the young Vivaldi?&mdash;have I already forgotten the church of the Spirito Santo?" This con&s;ideration reanimated him; vengeance nerved his arm, and drawing a&s;ide the lawn from her bo&s;om, he once more rai&s;ed it to &s;trike; when after gazing for an in&s;tant, &s;ome new cau&s;e of horror &s;eemed to &s;eize all his frame, and he &s;tood for &s;ome moments agha&s;t and motionle&s;s like a &s;tatue. His re&s;piration was &s;hort and laborious, chilly drops &s;tood on his fore hand, and all his faculties of the mind &s;eemed &s;upended. When he recovered, he &s;tooped to examine again the miniature, which had occa&s;ioned this revolution, and which had lain concealed beneath the lawn that he withdrew. The terrible certainty was almo&s;t confirmed, and forgetting, in his impati|ence to know the truth, the imprudence of &s;uddenly di&s;covering him&s;elf to Ellena at this hour of the night, and with a dagger at his feet, he called loudly. "A|wake!
<PB N="42" REF="032735_0332_0FF496995E4246E0">
awake! Say, what is your name! Speak &s;peak quickly!</P>
<P>Ellena, arou&s;ed by a man's voice, &s;tarted from her mattre&s;s, when, perceiving Schedoni, and by the pale glare of the lamp, his haggard countenance, &s;he &s;hriek|ed, and &s;unk back on the pillow. She had not faint|ed; and believing that he came to murder her, &s;he now exerted her&s;elf to plead for mercy. The ener|gy of her feelings enabled her to ri&s;e and throw her&s;elf at his feet. "Be merciful, O father! be merciful! &s;aid &s;he, in a trembling voice.</P>
<P>"Father, interrupted Schedoni&punc; with earne&s;tne&s;s; and then &s;eeming to re&s;train him&s;elf, he added, with unaffected &s;urpi&s;e, "Why are you thus terrified?" for he had lo&s;t, in new intere&s;ts and emotions, all con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of evil intention, and of the &s;ingularity of his &s;ituation. "What do you fear?" he repeated.</P>
<P>"Have pity, holy father!" exclaimed Ellena in agony.</P>
<P>"Why do you not &s;ay who&s;e portrait that is?" de|manded he, forgetting that he had not a&s;ked the que&s;|tion before.</P>
<P>"Who&s;e portrait?" repeated the Confe&s;&s;or in a loud voice.</P>
<P>"Who&s;e portrait!" &s;aid Ellena, with extreme &s;ur|pri&s;e.</P>
<P>"Ay, how came you by it? Be quick&mdash;who&s;e re|&s;emblance is it?"</P>
<P>"Why &s;hould you wi&s;h to know?" &s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P>"An&s;wer my que&s;tion," repeated Schedoni, with encrea&s;ing &s;ternne&s;s.</P>
<P>"I cannot part with it, holy father," replied El|lena, pre&s;&s;ing it to her bo&s;om, "you do not wi&s;h me to part with!"</P>
<P>"Is it impo&s;&s;ible to make you an&s;wer my que&s;tion!" &s;aid he, in extreme perturbation, and turning away from her, "has fear utterly confounded you!" Then, again &s;tepping towards her, and &s;eizing her wri&s;t, he epeated the demand in a tone of de&s;peration.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="032735_0333_0FF4964158349438">
"Alas! he is dead! or I &s;hould not now want a protector, replied Ellena, &s;hrinking from his gra&s;p, and weeping.</P>
<P>"You trifle," &s;aid Schedoni, with a terrible look, "I once more demand an an&s;we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;who&s;e picture?"&mdash;</P>
<P>Ellena lifted it, gazed upon it for a momemt, and then pre&s;&s;ing it to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er lips, "This was my father."</P>
<P>"Your father!" he repeated in an inward voice, "your father!" and &s;huddering turned away.</P>
<P>Ellena looked at him with &s;urpri&s;e. "I never knew a father's care," &s;he &s;aid, nor till lately did I perceive the want of it.&mdash;But now."&mdash;</P>
<P>"His name?" interrupted the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"But now," continued Ellena&mdash;"if you are not as a father to me&mdash;to whom can I look for pro|tection?"</P>
<P>"His name," repeated Schedoni, with &s;terner em|pha&s;is.</P>
<P>"It is &s;acred," replied Ellena, "for he was unfor|tunate!"</P>
<P>"His name?" demanded the Confe&s;&s;or, furiou&s;ly,</P>
<P>"I have promi&s;ed to conceal it, father."</P>
<P>"On your life, I charge you tell it; remember, on your life!"</P>
<P>Ellena trembled, was &s;ilent, and with &s;upplicating looks implored him to de&s;i&s;t from enquiry, but he urg|ed the que&s;tion more irre&s;i&s;tibly. "His name than," &s;aid &s;he. "was Marinella."</P>
<P>Schedoni groaned and turned away; but in a few &s;econds, &s;truggling to command the agitation that &s;hattered his whole frame, he returned to Ellena, and rai&s;ed her from her knees, on which &s;he had thrown her&s;elf to implore mercy.</P>
<P>"The place of his re&s;idence?" &s;aid the Monk.</P>
<P>"It was far from hence," &s;he replied; but he de|manded an unequivocal an&s;wer, and &s;he reluctantly gave one.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="032735_0334_0FF4969AE4EF9CB8">
Schedoni turned away as before, groaned heavily, and paced the chamber without &s;peaking; while El|lena in her turn, enquired the motive of his que&s;tions, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e occa&s;ion of his agitation. But he &s;eemed not to notice any thing &s;he &s;aid, and, wholl gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en up to his feelings, was inflexibly &s;ilent, while he &s;talk|ed, with mea&s;ured &s;teps along the room, and his face half hid by his cowl, was bent towards the ground.</P>
<P>Ellena's terror began to yield to a&s;toni&s;hment, and this emotion encrea&s;ed, when Schedoni approaching her, &s;he perceived tears &s;well in his eyes, which were fixt on her's and his countenance &s;often from the wild di&s;order that had marked it. Still he could not &s;peak. At length he yielded to the fullne&s;s of his heart, and Schedoni, the &s;tern Schedoni wept and &s;ighed! He &s;eated him&s;elf on the mattre&s;s be&s;ide Ellena, took her hand, which, &s;he affrighted, attempted to withdraw, and when he could command his voice, &s;aid, "Unhappy child!&mdash;behold your more unhappy father!" As he concluded, his voice was evercome by groans, and he drew the cowl entirely over his face.</P>
<P>"My father!" exclaimed the a&s;toni&s;hed and doubt|ing Ellena&mdash;"my father!" and fixed her eyes up|on him. He gave no reply, but when, a moment af|ter, he lifted his head, "Why do you reproach me with tho&s;e looks! &s;aid the con&s;cious Schedoni.</P>
<P>"Reproach you!&mdash;reproach my father!" repeated Ellena, in accents &s;oftening into tenderne&s;s, <HI>Why</HI> &s;hould I reproach my father!</P>
<P><HI>"Why?"</HI> exclaimed Schedoni, &s;tarting from his &s;eat, "Great God!"</P>
<P>As he moved, he &s;tumbled over the dagger at his foot; at that moment it might be &s;aid to &s;trike into his heart. He pu&s;hed it ha&s;tily from his &s;ight, El|lena had not ob&s;erved it; but &s;he ob&s;erved his labour|ing brea&s;t, his di&s;tracted looks, and quick &s;teps as he walked to and fro in the chamber; and &s;he a&s;ked, with
<PB N="45" REF="032735_0335_0FF4964BF2BBAFA8">
the mo&s;t &s;oothing accents of compa&s;&s;ions, and looks of anxious gentlene&s;s, what made him &s;o unhappy, and tried to a&s;&s;uage his &s;ufferings. They &s;eemed to en|crea&s;e with every wi&s;h &s;he expre&s;&s;ed to di&s;pel them; at one moment he would pau&s;e to gaze upon her, and in the next would quit her with a frenzied &s;tart.</P>
<P>"Why do you look &s;o piteou&s;ly upon me, father?" Ellena &s;aid, "why are you &s;o unhappy? Tell me, that I may comfort you,"</P>
<P>This appeal renewed all the violence of remor&s;e and grief, and he pre&s;&s;ed her to his bo&s;om, and wetted her cheek with his tears. Ellena wept to &s;ee him weep till her doubts began to take alarm. Whatever might be the proofs, that had convinced Schedoni of the rela|tion&s;hip between them, he had not explained the&s;e to her, and, however &s;trong was the eloquence of nature which &s;he witne&s;&s;ed, it was not &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify an entire confidence in the a&s;&s;ertion he had made, or to allow her to permit his care&s;&s;es without trembling. She &s;hrunk, and endeavoured to di&s;engage her&s;elf; when, immediately under&s;tanding her, he &s;aid, "Can you doubt the cau&s;e of the&s;e emotions? the&s;e &s;igns of paternal affection?"</P>
<P>"Have I not rea&s;on to doubt," replied Ellena, timid|ly "&s;ince I never witne&s;&s;ed them before?"</P>
<P>He withdrew his arms, and fixing his eyes earne&s;t|ly on hers, regarded her for &s;ome moments, in expre&s;|&s;ive &s;ilence, "Poor Innocent!" &s;aid he, at length, "you know not how much your words convey!&mdash;It is too true, you never have known a father's tender|ne&s;s till now!"</P>
<P>His countenance darkened while he &s;poke, and he ro&s;e again from his &s;eat. Ellena, meanwhile, a&s;to|ni&s;hed, terrified and oppre&s;&s;ed by a variety of emotoins and no power to demand his rea&s;ons for the belief that &s;o much agitated him, or any explanation of his con|duct; but &s;he appealed to the portrait, and endeavour|ed
<PB N="46" REF="032735_0336_0FF496A4CAE65820">
by tracing &s;ome re&s;emblance between it and Sche|doni, to decide her doubts. The countenance of each was as different in character as in years. The mini|ature di&s;played a young man, rather hand&s;ome, of a gay and &s;miling countenance; yet the &s;mile expre&s;&s;ed triumph, rather than &s;weetne&s;s, and his whole air and features were di&s;tingui&s;hed by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;u|periority that ro&s;e even to haughtine&s;s.</P>
<P>Schedoni, on the contrary, advanced in years, exhi|bited a &s;evere phy&s;iognomy, furrowed by thought, no le&s;s than by time, and darkened by the habitual indulgence of moro&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. He looked as if he had never &s;miled &s;ince the portrait was drawn; and it &s;eemed as if the painter, prophetic of Schedoni's future di&s;po&s;ition, had arre&s;ted and embodied that &s;mile to prove, hereafter, that cheerfulne&s;s had once played upon his features.</P>
<P>Though the expre&s;&s;ion was &s;o different between the countenance, which Schedoni formerly owned, and that he now wore the &s;ame character of haughty pride was vi&s;ible in both; and Ellena did trace a re|&s;emblance in the bold outline of the features, but not &s;ufficient to convince her, without farther evidence, that each belonged to the &s;ame per&s;on, and that the Confe&s;&s;or had ever been the young cavalier in the portrait. In the fir&s;t tumult of her thoughts, &s;he had not had lei&s;ure to dwell upon the &s;ingularity of Sche|doni's vi&s;iting her at this deep hour of the night, or to urge any que&s;tions, except vague ones, concerning the truth of her relation&s;hip to him. But now, that her mind was &s;omewhat recollected, and that his looks were le&s;s terrific, &s;he ventured to a&s;k a fuller explana|tion of the&s;e circum&s;tances, and his rea&s;ons for the late extraordinary a&s;&s;ertion. "It is pa&s;t midnight, father &s;aid Ellena, "you may judge then how anxious I am to learn, what motive led you to my chamber at this lonely hour?"</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="032735_0337_0FF4964D7AA31008">
Schedoni made no reply.</P>
<P>"Did you come to warn me of my danger?" &s;he continued, "had you di&s;covered the cruel de&s;igns of Spalatro? Ah! when I &s;upplicated for your compa&s;|&s;ion on the &s;hore this evening, you little thought what perils &s;urrounded me! or you would&mdash;."</P>
<P>"You &s;ay true! interrupted he, in a hurried man|ner, "but name the &s;ubject no more. Why will you per&s;i&s;t in returning to it?"</P>
<P>His words &s;urprized Ellena, who had not even al|luded to the &s;ubject till now; but the returning wild|ne&s;s of his countenance, made her fearful of dwelling upon the topic, even &s;o far as to point out his error.</P>
<P>Another deep pau&s;e &s;ucceeded, during which Sche|doni continued to pace the room, &s;ometimes &s;topping for an in&s;tant, to fix his eyes on Ellena, and regard|ing her with an earne&s;tne&s;s that &s;eemed to partake of frenzy, and then gloomily withdrawing his regards, and &s;ighing heavily, as he turned away to a di&s;tant part of the room. She, meanwhile, agitated with a&s;to|ni&s;hment at his conduct, as well as at her own circum|&s;tances, and with the fear of offending him by further que&s;tions, endeavoured to &s;ummon courage to &s;olicit the explanation which was &s;o important to her tran|quillity. At length &s;he a&s;ked, how &s;he might ven|ture to believe a circum&s;tance &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing, as that of which he had ju&s;t a&s;&s;ured her, and to remind him that he had not yet di&s;clo&s;ed his rea&s;on for admitting the belief.</P>
<P>The Confe&s;&s;or's feelings were eloquent in reply; and, when at length they were &s;ufficiently &s;ubdued, to permit him to talk coherently, he mentioned &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances concerning Ellena's family, that proved him at lea&s;t to have been intimately acquainted with it; and others, which &s;he believed were known only to Bianchi and her&s;elf, that removed every doubt of his identity.</P>
<P>This, however, was a period of his life too big with
<PB N="48" REF="032735_0338_0FF496A652EFABE8">
remor&s;e, horror, and the fir&s;t pangs of parental affec|tion, to allow him to conver&s;e long; deep &s;olitude was nece&s;&s;ary for his &s;oul. He wi&s;hed to plunge where no eye might re&s;train his emotions or ob&s;erve the overflowing angui&s;h of his heart. Having obtained &s;ufficient proof to convince him that Ellena was in|deed his child, and a&s;&s;ured her that &s;he &s;hould be re|moved from this hou&s;e on the following day, and be re&s;tored to her home, he abruptly left the chamber.</P>
<P>As he de&s;cended the &s;tair-ca&s;e, Spalatro &s;tepped for|ward to meet him, the cloak which had been de&s;igned to wrap the mangled form of Ellena, when it &s;hould be carried to the &s;hore. "Is it done?" &s;aid the ruf|fian, in a &s;tiffled voice; "I am ready;" and he &s;pread forth the cloak, and began to a&s;cend.</P>
<P>"Hold! villian, hold! &s;aid Schedoni, lifting up his head for the fir&s;t time, "Dare to enter that chamber, and your life &s;hall an&s;wer fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> it."</P>
<P>"What!" exclaimed the man, &s;hinking back a&s;ton|i&s;hed&mdash;"will not <HI>her's</HI> &s;atisfy you?"</P>
<P>He trembled for the con&s;equence of what he had &s;aid, when he ob&s;erved the changing countenance of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. But Schedoni &s;poke not: the tumult in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> brea&s;t was too great for utterance, and he pre&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily forward. Spalatro followed. "Be plea&s;ed to tell me what I am to do," &s;aid he, again holding forth the cloak.</P>
<P>"Avaunt!" exclaimed the other, turning fiercely upon him; "leave me."</P>
<P>"How!" &s;ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the man, who&s;e &s;pirit was now a rou&s;ed, "has <HI>your</HI> courage failed too, Signor? If &s;o, I will prove my&s;elf no da&s;tard, though you called me one; I'll do the bu&s;ine&s;s my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Villian! fiend! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cried Schedoni, &s;eizing the ruf|fian by the throat, with a gra&s;p that &s;eemed intended to annihilate him; when, recollecting that the fellow was only willing to obey the very in&s;tructions he had
<PB N="49" REF="032735_0339_0FF4964F06F4B748">
him&s;elf but lately delivered to him, or other emotions &s;ucceeded to that of rage; he &s;lowly liberated him, and in accents broken, and &s;oftening from &s;ternne&s;s, bade him retire to re&s;t. "To-morrow," he added, "I will &s;peak further with you. As for this night&mdash;I have changed my purpo&s;e. Begone!"</P>
<P>Spalatro was about to expre&s;s the indignation, which a&s;toni&s;hment and fear had hitherto overcome, but his employer repeated his command in a voice of thunder, and clo&s;ed the door of his apartment with vio|lence, as he &s;hut out a man who&s;e pre&s;ence was be|come hateful to him. He felt relieved by his ab&s;ence, and began to breathe more freely, till remembering that this accomplice had ju&s;t boa&s;ted that he was no da&s;tard, he dreaded le&s;t by way of proving the a&s;&s;er|tion, he &s;hould attempt to commit the crime, from which he had lately &s;hrunk. Terrified at the po&s;&s;ibil|ity, and even apprehending that it might already have become a reality, he ru&s;hed from the room, and found Spalatro in the pa&s;&s;age leading to the private &s;tair-ca&s;e; but, whatever might have been his purpo&s;e, the &s;ituation and looks of the latter were &s;ufficiently alarm|ing. At the approach of Schedoni, he turned his &s;ul|len <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> malignant countenance towards him, without an&s;wering the call, or the demand as to his bu&s;ine&s;s there; and with &s;low &s;teps obeyed the order of his ma&s;ter, that he &s;hould withdraw to his room. Thither Sche|doni followed, and, having locked him in it for the night, he reparied to the apartment of Ellena, which he &s;ecured from the po&s;&s;ibility of intru&s;ion. He then returned to his own, not to &s;leep, but to abandon him&s;elf to the agonies of remor&s;e and horror; and he yet &s;huddered, like a man who has ju&s;t recoiled from the brink of a precipice, but who &s;till me &s;ures the gulf with his eye.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EELLENA, when Schedoni had left her, recol|lected all the particulars, which he had thought proper to reveal concerning her family, and comparing them with &s;uch circum&s;tances as the late Bianchi had related on the &s;ame &s;ubject, &s;he perceived nothing that was contradictory between the two accounts But &s;he knew not even yet enough of her own &s;tory, to under&s;tand why Bianchi had been &s;ilent as to &s;ome particulars, which had ju&s;t been di&s;clo&s;ed. From Bianchi &s;he had always under&s;tood, that her mother had married a nobleman of the duchy of Milan, and of the hou&s;e of Marinella; that the marriage had been unfortunate; and that &s;he her&s;elf, even before the death of the Counte&s;s, had been committed to the care of Bianchi, the only &s;i&s;ter of that lady. Of this event, or of her mo|ther, Ellena had no remembrance; for the kindne&s;s of Bianchi had obliterated from her mind the lo&s;s and the griefs of her early infancy; and &s;he recollected only the accident which had di&s;covered to her, in Bianchi's cabinet, after the death of the latter, the minature and the name of her father. When &s;he had enquired the rea&s;on of this injunction Bianchi replied, that the de|graded fortune of her hou&s;e rendered privacy de&s;ira|ble; and an&s;wered her further que&s;tions concerning her father, by relating, that he had died while &s;he was an infant. The picture, which Ellena had di&s;cover|ed, Bianchi had found among the trinkets of the depar|ted Counte&s;s, and de&s;igned to pre&s;ent it at &s;ome future
<PB N="51" REF="032735_0341_0FF49702D76C5680">
perid to Ellena, when her di&s;cretion might he tru&s;ted with a knowledge of her family. This was the whole of what Signora Bianchi had judged it nece&s;&s;ary to explain, though in her la&s;t hours it appeared that &s;he wi&s;hed to reveal more; but it was then too late.</P>
<P>Though Ellena perceived that many circum&s;tances of the relations given by Schedoni, and by Signora Bianchi, coincided, and that none were contradictory, except that of his death, &s;he could not yet &s;ubdue her amazement at this di&s;covery or even the doubts which occa&s;ionally recurred to her as to its truth. Schedo|ni, on the contrary, had not even appeared &s;urprized, when &s;he a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;he always under&s;tood her father had been dead many years; though when &s;he a&s;ked if her mother too was living, both his di&s;tre&s;s and his a&s;&s;urances confirmed the relations made by Bianchi.</P>
<P>When Ellena's mind became more tranquil &s;he noticed again the &s;ingularity of Schedoni's vi&s;it to her apartment at &s;o &s;acred an hour; and her thoughts glanced back involuntarily to the &s;cene of the preceed|ing evening on the &s;ea-&s;hore, and the image of her father appeared in each, in the terrific character of an agent of the Marche&s;a di Vivaldi. The &s;u&s;picions, however, which &s;he had formerly admitted, re&s;pect|ing his de&s;igns, were now impatiently rejected, for &s;he was le&s;s anxious to di&s;cover truth, than to relea&s;e her|&s;elf from horrible &s;uppo&s;itions; and &s;he willingly be|lieved that Schedoni having mi&s;under&s;tood her charac|ter, had only de&s;igned to a&s;&s;i&s;t in removing her be|yond the reach of Vivaldi&mdash;The ingenuity of hope &s;ugge&s;ted al&s;o, that, having ju&s;t heard from her con|ducters, or from Spalatro, &s;ome circum&s;tances of her &s;tory, he had been led to a &s;u&s;picion of the relation&s;hip between them, and that in the fir&s;t impatience of par|ental anxiety, he had di&s;regarded the hour and come, though at midnight, to her apartment to a&s;certain the truth.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="032735_0342_0FF496A95EA71778">
While &s;he &s;oothed her&s;elf with this explanation of a circum&s;tance, which had occa&s;ioned her con&s;iderable &s;urpri&s;e, &s;he perceived on the floor the point of a dag|ger peeping from beneath the curtains! Emotions al|mo&s;t too horrible to be &s;u&s;tained, followed this di&s;|covery; &s;he took the in&s;trument, and gazed upon it agha&s;t, and trembling; for a &s;u&s;picion of the real motive of Schedoni's vi&s;it glanced upon her mind. But it was only for a moment; &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition was too terrible to be willingly endured; &s;he again believed that Spalatro alone had meditated her de&s;|truction, and &s;he thanked the Confe&s;&s;or as her deliv|erer, in&s;tead of &s;hrinking from him as an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. She now under&s;tood that Schedoni, having di&s;covered the ruffian's de&s;ign, had ru&s;hed into the chamber to &s;ave a &s;tranger from his murderous poignard, and had uncon&s;cion&s;lly re&s;cued his own daughter, when the portrait at her bo&s;om informed him of the truth. With this conviction, Ellena's eyes overflowed with gratitude, and her heart was hu&s;hed to peace.</P>
<P>Schedoni, meanwhile, &s;hut up in his chamber, was agitated by feelings of a very oppo&s;ite nature. When their fir&s;t exce&s;s was exhau&s;ted, and his mind was calm enough to reflect, the images that appeared on it &s;truck him with &s;olemn wonder. In pur&s;uing Ellena as the criminal in&s;tigation of the Marche&s;a di Vivaldi, it ap|peared that he had been per&s;ecuting his own child; and in thus con&s;enting to con&s;pire again&s;t the inno|cent, he had, in the event, been only puni&s;hing the guilty, and preparing mortification for him&s;elf on the exact &s;ubject to which he had &s;acrificed his con&s;cience. Every &s;tep that he had taken, with a view of gratify|ing his ambition was r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ograde, and while he had been wickedly intent to &s;erve the Merche&s;a and him|&s;elf, by preventing the marriage of Vivaldi and El|lena, he had been labouriou&s;ly counteracting his own fortune. An alliance with the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Vi|valdi,
<PB N="53" REF="032735_0343_0FF497045D3C4C78">
was above his loftie&s;t hope of advancement, and this event he had him&s;elf nearly prevented by the very means which had been adopted, at the expence of every virtuous con&s;ideration, to obtain an inferior promotion. Thus, by a &s;ingular retribution, his own crimes had recoiled upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Schedoni perceived the many ob&s;tacles, which lay between him and his newly-awakened hopes, and that much was to be overcome before tho&s;e nuptials could be publicly &s;olemnized, which he was now &s;till more anxious to promote, then he had lately been to pre|vent. The approbation of the Marche&s;a was, at lea&s;t, de&s;irable, for &s;he had much at her di&s;po&s;al, and with|out it, though his daughter might be the wife of Vi|valdi, he him&s;elf would be no otherwi&s;e benefited at pre&s;ent than by the honour of the connection. He had &s;ome peculiar rea&s;ons for believing, that her con&s;ent might be obtained, and, though there was hazard in delaying the nuptials till &s;uch an experiment had been made, he re&s;olved to encounter it, rather than forbear to &s;olicit her concurrence. But, if the Marche&s;a &s;hould prove inexorable, he determined to be&s;tow the hand of Ellena, without her knowledge; and in doing &s;o he well knew that he incurred little danger from her re&s;entment, &s;ince he had &s;ecrets in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of which mu&s;t awe her into a &s;peedy neutrality. The con&s;ent of the Marche&s;e, as he de&s;|paired of obtaining it, he did not mean to &s;olicit, and the influence of the Marche&s;a was &s;uch, that Schedoni did not regard that as e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;teps, however, to be taken, were tho&s;e that might relea&s;e Vivaldi from the Inqui&s;ition, the tremendous pri&s;on into which Schedoni him&s;elf, little fore&s;eeing that he &s;hould &s;o &s;oon wi&s;h for his liberation, had cau&s;ed him to be thrown. He had always under|&s;tood, indeed, that if the Informer forbore to appear again&s;t the Accu&s;ed in this Court, the latter would
<PB N="54" REF="032735_0344_0FF496B4E6ADC390">
of cour&s;e, be liberated, and he al&s;o believed, that Vi|valdi's freedom could be obtained whenever be &s;hould think proper to apply to a per&s;on at Naples, whom he knew to be connected with the <HI>Holy Office</HI> of Rome. How much the Confe&s;&s;or had &s;uffered his wi&s;hes to deceive him, may appear hereafter. His motives for having thus confined Vivaldi, were partly tho&s;e of &s;elf-defence. He dreaded the di&s;covery and the ven|geance, which might follow the lo&s;s of Ellena, &s;hould Vivaldi be at liberty immediately to pur&s;ue his enqui|ries. But he believed that all trace of her mu&s;t be loft, after a few weeks had elap&s;ed, and that Vivaldi's &s;ufferings, from confinement in the Inqui&s;ition, would have given intere&s;ts to his mind, which mu&s;t weaken the one he left for Ellena. Yet, though in this in|&s;tance, &s;elf-defence had been a principal motive with Schedoni, a de&s;ire of revenging the in&s;ult he had re|ceived in the church of the Spirito Santo, and all the con&s;equent mortifications he experienced had been a &s;econd; and, &s;uch was the blackne&s;s of this hatred, and the avarice of his revenge, that he had not con&s;i|dered the &s;uffering, which the lo&s;s of Ellena would oc|ca&s;ion Vivaldi, as &s;ufficient retaliation.</P>
<P>In adopting a mode of puni&s;hment &s;o extraordinary as that of impri&s;onment in the Inqui&s;iton, it appears, therefore, that Schedoni was influenced, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">partly by the difficulty of otherwi&s;e confining Vivaldi, during the pe|riod of which confinement was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ucce&s;s of his own &s;chemes, and partly by a de&s;ire of inflicting the tortures of terror. He had al&s;o been encouraged by his di&s;covery of this opportunity for conferring new obligations on the Marche&s;a. The very conduct, that mu&s;t have appeared to the fir&s;t glance of an hone&s;t mind fatal to his intere&s;ts, he thought might be rendered beneficial to them, and that his dex|terity could &s;o command the bu&s;ine&s;s, as that the Mar|che&s;a &s;hould eventually thank him as the deliverer of
<PB N="55" REF="032735_0345_0FF5850686DC0EC8">
her &s;on, in&s;tead of di&s;covering and execrating him as his Accu&s;er; a &s;cheme favoured by the unju&s;t and cru|el rule enacted by the tribunal he approached, which permitted anonymous Informers.</P>
<P>To procure the arre&s;tation of Vivaldi, it had been only nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end a written accu&s;ation, without a name, to the <HI>Holy Office,</HI> with a mention of the place where the accu&s;ed per&s;on migh be &s;eized; but the &s;uf|fering, in con&s;equence of this, did not always proceed further than the <HI>que&s;tion;</HI> &s;ince, if the Informer failed to di&s;cover him&s;elf to the inqui&s;itors, the pri&s;oner after many examinations, was relea&s;ed, unle&s;s he happened unwarily to criminate him&s;elf. Schedoni, as he did not intend to pro&s;ecute, believed, therefore, that Vi|valdi would, of cour&s;e, be di&s;charged after a certain pe|riod, and &s;uppo&s;ing it al&s;o utterly impo&s;&s;ible that he could ever di&s;cover his Accu&s;er, the Confe&s;&s;or deter|mined to appear anxious and active in effecting his re|lea&s;e. This character of a deliverer, he knew he &s;hould be the better enabled to &s;upport by means of a per&s;on officially connected with the <HI>Holy Office,</HI> who had already uncon&s;ciou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted his views. In the apartment of this man, Schedoni had accidently &s;een a formula of arre&s;tation again&s;t a per&s;on &s;u&s;pect|ed of Here&s;y, the view of which had not only &s;ugge&s;t|ed to him the plan he had &s;ince adopted, but had, in &s;ome degree, a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to carry it into effect. He had &s;een the &s;croll only for a &s;hort time, but his ob&s;er|vations were &s;o minute, and his memory &s;o clear, that he was able to copy it with at lea&s;t &s;ufficient exact|ne&s;s to impo&s;e upon the Benedictine prie&s;t, who had, perhaps, &s;eldom, or never &s;een a real in&s;trument of this kind, Schedoni had employed this artifice for the purpo&s;e of immediately &s;ecuring Vivaldi, apprehend|ing that, while the Inqui&s;itors were &s;lowly delibera|ting upon his arre&s;t, he might quit Celano, and elude di&s;covery. If the deception &s;ucceeded, it would ena|ble
<PB N="56" REF="032735_0346_0FF496B66E95E358">
him al&s;o to &s;eize Ellena, and to mi&s;lead Vivaldi re&s;pecting her de&s;tination. The charge of having carried off a nun, might appear to be corroborated by many circum&s;tances, and Schedoni would probably have made the&s;e the &s;ubject of real denunciation, had he not for&s;een the danger and the trouble in which it might implicate him&s;elf; and that, as the charge could not be &s;ub&s;tantiated, Ellena would finally e&s;|cape. As far as his plan ow went, it had been &s;uc|ce&s;sful; &s;ome of the bravoes whom he hired to per&s;on|ate officiels, had conveyed Vivaldi to the town, when the real officers of the Inqui&s;ition were appointed to receive him; while the others carried Ellena to the &s;hore of the Adriatic. Schedoni had much applauded his own ingenuity, in thus contriving, by the matter of the forged accu&s;ation, to throw an impenetrable veil over the fate of Ellena, and to &s;ecure him&s;elf from the &s;u&s;picions or vengeance of Vivaldi, who, it appeared, would always believe that &s;he had died, or was &s;till confined in the un&s;earchable pri&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>Thus he had betrayed him&s;elf in endeavouring to betray Vivaldi, who&s;e relea&s;e, however, he yet &s;uppo&s;|ed could be ea&s;ily obtained; but how much his policy had, in this in&s;tance, outrun his &s;agacity, now remain|ed to be proved.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of Schedoni's immediate perplexity, was the difficulty of conveying Ellena back to Na|ples; &s;ince, not chu&s;ing to appear, at pre&s;ent, in the character of her father, he could not decorou&s;ly ac|company her thither him&s;elf, nor could he prudent|ly entru&s;t her to the conduct of any per&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he knew in this neighbourhood. It was, however, nece&s;|&s;ary to form a &s;peedy determination, for he could nei|ther endure to pa&s;s another day in a &s;cene which mu&s;t continually impre&s;s him with the horrors of the preced|ing night, nor that Ellena &s;hould remain in it; and the morning-light already gleamed upon his ca&s;ements.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="032735_0347_0FF4970D6B1E5868">
After &s;ome further deliberation, he re&s;olved to be him&s;elf her conductor, as far, at lea&s;t, as through the fore&s;ts of the Garganus, and at the fir&s;t town where conveniencies could be procured, to throw a&s;ide his Monk's habit, and, a&s;&s;uming the dre&s;s of a layman, ac|company her in this di&s;gui&s;e towards Naples, till he &s;hould either di&s;cover &s;ome &s;ecure means of &s;ending her forward to that city, or a temporary a&s;ylum for her in a convent on the way.</P>
<P>His mind was &s;carcely more tranquil, after having formed this determination, than before, and he did not attempt to repo&s;e him&s;elf even for a moment. The circum&s;tances of the late di&s;covery were almo&s;t per|petually recurring to his affrighted con&s;cience, accom|panied by a fear that Ellena might &s;u&s;pect the real purpo&s;e of his midnight vi&s;it; and he alternately form|ed and rejected plau&s;ible fal&s;ehoods, that might a&s;|&s;uage her curio&s;ity, and delude her apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>The hour arrived, however, when it was nece&s;&s;a|ry to prepare for departure, and found him &s;till unde|cided as to the explanation he &s;hould form.</P>
<P>Having relea&s;ed Spalatro from his chamber, and given him directions to procure hor&s;es and a guide immediately from the neighbouring hamlet, he repair|ed to Ellena's room, to prepare her for this ha&s;ty re|moval. On approaching it, a remembrance of the purpo&s;e, with which he had la&s;t pa&s;&s;ed through the&s;e &s;ame pa&s;&s;ages and &s;tairca&s;e, appealed &s;o powerfully to his feelings, that he was unable to proceed, and he turned back to his own apartment to recover &s;ome command over him&s;elf. A few moments re&s;tored to him his u&s;ual addre&s;s, though not his tranquillity, and he again approached the chamber; it was now, how|e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er by way of the corridor. As he unbarred the door, his hand trembled; but, when he entered the room, his countenance and manner had re&s;umed their u&s;ual &s;olemnity, and his voice only would have betray|ed,
<PB N="58" REF="032735_0348_0FF496B7F77E3128">
to an attentive ob&s;erver, the agitation of his mind.</P>
<P>Ellena was con&s;iderably affected on &s;eeing him a|gain, and he examined with a jealous eye the emo|tions he witne&s;&s;ed. The &s;mile with which &s;he met him was tender, but he perceived it pa&s;s away from her features, like the aerial colouring that illumines a mountain's brow; and the gloom of doubt and ap|prehen&s;ion again over&s;pread them. As he advanced, he held forth his hand for her's, when &s;uddenly per|ceiving the dagger he had left in the chamber, he in|voluntarily withdrew his proffered courte&s;y, and his countenance changed. Ellena, who&s;e eyes followed his to the object that attracted them, pointed to the in&s;trument, took it up, and approached him, &s;aid, "This dagger I found la&s;t night in my chamber! O my father!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"That dagger!" &s;aid Schedoni, with affected &s;ur|pri&s;e.</P>
<P>"Examine it," continued Ellena, while &s;he held it up, "Do you know to whom it belongs? and who brought it hither?"</P>
<P>"What is it you mean?" a&s;ked Schedoni, betray|ed by his feelings.</P>
<P>"Do you know, too, for what purpo&s;e it was brought?" &s;aid Ellena mournfully.</P>
<P>The Confe&s;&s;or made no reply, but irre&s;olutely at|tempted to &s;eize the in&s;trument.</P>
<P>"O yes, I perceive you know too well," continu|ed Ellena, "here, my father, while I &s;lept."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Give me the dagger," interrupted Schedoni, in a frightful voice.</P>
<P>"Yes, my father, I will give it as an offering of my gratitude," replied Ellena, but as &s;he rai&s;ed her eyes, filled with tears, his look and fixed attitude ter|rified her, and &s;he added with a &s;till more per&s;ua&s;ive tenderne&s;s, "Will you not accept the offering of your child, for having pre&s;erved her from the poignard of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="032735_0349_0FF4970EF2B5C408">
Schedoni's looks became yet darker; he took the dagger in &s;ilence, and threw it with violence to the fur|the&s;t end of the chamber, while his eyes remained fixed on her's. The force of the action alarmed her; "Yes, it is in vain that you would conceal the truth," &s;he added, weeping unre&s;trainedly, "your goodne&s;s can|not avail; I know the whole."&mdash;</P>
<P>The la&s;t words arou&s;ed Schedoni again from his trance, his features became convul&s;ed, and his look fu|rious. "What do you know?" he demanded in a &s;ub|due voice, that &s;eemed ready to bur&s;t in thunder.</P>
<P>"All that I owe you," replied Ellena, that la&s;t night, while I &s;lept upon this mattre&s;s, un&s;u&s;picious of what was de&s;igned again&s;t me, an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in entered the chamber with that in&s;trument in his hand, and&mdash;"</P>
<P>A &s;tifled groan from Schedoni checked Ellena; &s;he ob&s;erved his rolling eyes, and trembled; till be|lieving that his agitation was occa&s;ioned by indigna|tion again&s;t the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, &s;he re&s;umed, "Why &s;hould you think it nece&s;&s;ary to conceal the danger which has threatened me, &s;ince it is to you that I owe my deli|verence from it? O! my father, do not deny me the plea&s;ure of &s;hedding the&s;e tears of gratitude, do not refu&s;e the thanks which are due to you! While I &s;lept upon that couch, while a ruffian &s;tole upon my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lumber&mdash;it was you, yes! can I ever forget that it was my father, who &s;aved me from his poignard!"</P>
<P>Schedoni's pa&s;&s;ions were changed, but they were not le&s;s violent; he could &s;carcely controul them, while he &s;aid, in a tremulous tone&mdash;" It is enough, &s;ay no more; and he rai&s;ed Ellena, but turned away without embracing her.</P>
<P>His &s;trong emotion, as he paced in &s;ilence, the fur|the&s;t end of the apartment, excited her &s;urpri&s;e, but &s;he then attributed it to a remembrance of the peri|lous moment, from which he had re&s;cued her.</P>
<P>Schedoni, meanwhile, to whom her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were
<PB N="60" REF="032735_0350_0FF496B9840F3EE0">
daggers, was trying to &s;ubdue the feelings of remor&s;e that tore his heart; and was &s;o enveloped in a world of his own, as to be for &s;ome time unconcious of all around him. He continued to &s;talk in gloomy &s;ilence along the chamber, till the voice of Ellena, entreating him rather to rejoice that he had been permitted to &s;ave her than &s;o deeply to con&s;ider dangers which were pa&s;t, again touched the cord that vibrated to his con|&s;cience, and recalled him to a &s;en&s;e of his &s;ituation. He then bid her prepare for immediate departure, and abruptly quitted the room.</P>
<P>Vainly hoping that in flying from the &s;cene of his mediated crime, he &s;hould leave with it the acutene&s;s of remembrance, and the agonizing &s;tings of remor&s;e, he was now more anxious than ever to leave this place. Yet he &s;hould &s;till be accompanied by Ellena, and her innocent looks, her affectionate thanks, in|flicted an angui&s;h which was &s;carcely endurable. Sometimes, thinking that her hatred, or what to him would be &s;till &s;everer, her contempt, mu&s;t be more tolerable than this gratitude, he almo&s;t re&s;olved to undeceive her re&s;pecting his conduct, but as con&s;tantly and impatiently repelled the thought with horror, and finally determined to &s;uffer her to account for his late extraordinary vi&s;it in the away &s;he had cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Spalatro, at length, returned from the hamlet with hor&s;es, but without having procured a guide to con|duct the travellers through a tract of the long-devolv|ing fore&s;ts of the Garganus, which it was nece&s;&s;ary for them to pa&s;s. No per&s;on had been willing to un|dertake &s;o arduous a ta&s;k; and Spalatro, who was well acquainted with all the labyrinths of the way, now of|fered his &s;ervices</P>
<P>Schedoni, though he could &s;carcely endure the pre|&s;ence of this man, had no alternative but to accept him, &s;ince he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the guide who had con|ducted him hither. Of per&s;onal violence Schedoni
<PB N="61" REF="032735_0351_0FF497108032D3B8">
had no apprehen&s;ion, though he too well under&s;tood, the villainy of his propo&s;ed companion; for he con|&s;idered that he him&s;elf &s;hould be well armed, and he determined to a&s;certain that Spalatro was without weapons, he knew, al&s;o, that in ca&s;e of a conte&s;t, his own &s;uperior &s;tature would ea&s;ily enable him to over|come &s;uch an antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>Every thing being now ready for departure, Ellena was &s;ummoned, and the Confe&s;&s;or led her to his own apartment, where a &s;light breakfa&s;t was prepared.</P>
<P>Her &s;pirits being revived by the &s;peed of this depar|ture, &s;he would again have expre&s;&s;ed her thanks, but he peremptorily interrupted her, and forbade any fur|ther mention of gratitude.</P>
<P>On entering the court where the hor&s;es were in wait|ing and perceiving Spalatro, Ellena &s;hrunk and put her arm within Schedoni's for protection. "What recollections does the pre&s;ence of that man revive!" &s;aid &s;he, "I can &s;carcely venture to believe my&s;elf &s;afe, even with you, when he is here."</P>
<P>Schedoni made no reply, till the remark was re|peated, "You have nothing to fear from him," mut|tered the Confe&s;&s;or, while he ha&s;tened her forward, "and we have no time to lo&s;e in vague apprehen&s;ion."</P>
<P>"How?" exclaimed Ellena, "is not he the a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;in from whom you &s;aved me? I cannot doubt, that you know him to be &s;uch, though you would &s;pare me the pain of believing &s;o."</P>
<P>"Well, well, be it &s;o," replied the Confe&s;&s;or; "Spa|latro lead the hor&s;es this way."</P>
<P>The party were &s;oon mounted, when, quitting this eventful man&s;ion, and the &s;hore of the Adriatic, as Ellena hoped for ever, they entered upon the gloomy wilderne&s;s of the Garganus. She often turned her eyes back upon the hou&s;e with emotions of inexpre&s;&s;ible awe, a&s;toni&s;hment, and thankfulne&s;s, and gazed while a glimp&s;e of its turretted walls could be caught beyond

the dark branches, which, clo&s;ing over it, at length &s;hut it from her view.

Schedoni, meanwhile, lo&s;t in thought, broke not, by a &s;ingle word, the deep &s;ilence of the &s;olitudes through which they pa&s;&s;ed. Spalatro was equally mute and e|qually engaged by his reflections on the &s;udden change in Schedoni's purpo&s;e, and by wonder as to the motive, which could have induced him to lead Ellena in &s;afety, from the very &s;pot whither &s;he was brought by his ex|pre&s;s command to be de&s;troyed. He, however, was not &s;o wholly occupied, as to be unmindful of his &s;itu|ation, or unwatchful of an opportunity of &s;erving his own intere&s;ts, and retaliating upon Schedoni for the treatment he had received on the preceding night.</P>
<P>Among the various &s;ubjects that di&s;tracted the Confe&s;&s;or, the difficulty of di&s;po&s;ing of Ellena, with|out betraying at Naples that &s;he was his relative, was not the lea&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. Whatever might be the rea&s;on which could ju&s;tify &s;uch feelings, his fears of a premature di&s;covery of the circum&s;tance to the &s;ociety with whom he lived, were &s;o &s;trong, as often to pro|duce the mo&s;t violent effect upon his countenance, and it was, perhaps, when he was occupied by this &s;ubject, that its terrific expre&s;&s;ion revived with Ellena the late &s;cence upon the &s;hore. His embarra&s;&s;ment was not le&s;s, as to the excu&s;e to be offered the Marche&s;a, for having failed to fulfil his engagement, and re&s;|pecting the means by which he might intere&s;t her in favour of Ellena, and even di&s;po&s;e her to approve the marriage, before &s;he &s;hould be informed of the family of this unfortunate young woman. Perceiving all the nece&s;&s;ity for a&s;certaining the probabilities of &s;uc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> con&s;ent, before he ventured to make an avowal of her origin, he determined not to reveal him&s;elf till he &s;hould be perfectly &s;ure that the di&s;covery would be acceptable to the Marche&s;a. In the mean time, as it would be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething of Ellena's birth, he meant to declare, that he had di&s;covered it to be no|ble, and her family worthy in every re&s;pect, of a con|nection with that of the Vivaldi,</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="032735_0354_0FF496C54E6D5FE8">
An interview with the Marche&s;a, was almo&s;t e|qually wi&s;hed for and dreaded by the Confe&s;&s;or. He &s;huddered at the expectation of meeting a woman, who had in&s;tigated him to the murder of his own child, which though he had been happily prevented from committing it, was an act that would &s;till be wi&s;hed for by the Marche&s;a. How could he endure her reproach|es, when we &s;hould di&s;cover that he had failed to ac|compli&s;h her will! How conceal the indignation of a father, and di&s;&s;imulated all a father's various feelings, when, in reply to &s;uch reproaches, he mu&s;t form ex|cu&s;es, and act humility, from which his whole &s;oul would revolt! Never could his arts of di&s;&s;imulation have been &s;o &s;everely tried, not, even in the late &s;cenes with Ellena, never have returned upon him&s;elf in puni&s;hment &s;o &s;evere, as in that which awaited him with the Marche&s;a. And from its approach the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and politic Schedoni often &s;hrunk in &s;uch horror, that he almo&s;t determined to avoid it at any hazard, and &s;e|cretly to unite Vivaldi and Ellena, without even &s;oli|citing the con&s;ent of the Marche&s;a.</P>
<P>A de&s;ire, however, of the immediate preferment &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to his pride, con&s;tantly checked this &s;cheme, and finally made him willing to &s;ubject every hone&s;t feeling, and &s;ubmit to any meanne&s;s, however, vicious, rather than forego the favourite object of his errone|ous ambition. Never, perhaps, was the paradoxical union of pride and abjectne&s;s, more &s;trongly exibited than on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>While thus the travellers &s;ilently proceeded, Elle|na's thoughts often turned to Vivaldi, and &s;he con&s;i|dered, with trembling anxiety, the effect which the late di&s;covery was likely to have upon their future lives. It appeared to her, that Schedoni mu&s;t ap|prove of a connection thus flattering to the pride of a father, though he would probably refu&s;e his, con|ent to a private marriage. And, when &s;he further
<PB N="65" REF="032735_0355_0FF4971CC67FF890">
con&s;idered the revolution, which a knowledge of her family might occa&s;ion towards her&s;elf in the minds of the Vivaldi, her pro&s;pects &s;eemed to brighten, and her cares began to di&s;&s;ipate. Judging that Schedoni mu&s;t be acquainted with the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of Vivaldi &s;he was continually on the point of mentioning him, but was as con&s;tantly re&s;trained by timidity, though, had &s;he &s;u&s;pected him to be an inhabitant of the Inqui&s;i|tion, her &s;cruples would have vani&s;hed before an irre&s;i&s;table intere&s;t. As it was, believing that he like her&s;elf, had been impo&s;ed upon by the Marche&s;a's a|gents, in the di&s;gui&s;e of officials, &s;he concluded, as has before appeared, that he now &s;uffered a temporary impri&s;onment by order of his mother, at one of the family vilas. When, however, Schedoni awaking from his reverie, abruptly mentioned Vivaldi, her &s;pi|rits fluttered with impatience to learn his exact &s;itu|ation, and &s;he enquired re&s;pecting it.</P>
<P>"Im no &s;tranger to your attachment," &s;aid Schedoni, evading the que&s;tion, "but I wi&s;h to be informed of &s;ome circum&s;tances relative to its commencement."</P>
<P>Ellena, confu&s;ed, and not knowing what to reply, was for a moment &s;ilent, and then repeated her en|quiry.</P>
<P>"Where did you fir&s;t meet?" &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or, &s;till di&s;regarding her que&s;tion. Ellena related, that &s;he had fir&s;t &s;een Vivaldi, when attending her aunt from the church of San Lorenzo. For the pre&s;ent &s;he was &s;pared the embarra&s;&s;ment of further explanation by Spalatro, who riding up to Schedoni, informed him they were approaching the town of Zanti. On look|ing foward, Ellena perceived hou&s;es peeping from a|mong the fore&s;t-trees, at a &s;hort di&s;tance, and pre&s;ent|ly heard the cheerful bark of a dog, that &s;ure herald and faithful &s;ervant of man!</P>
<P>Soon after the travellers entered Zanti, a &s;mall town &s;urrounded by the fore&s;t, where, however, the
<PB N="66" REF="032735_0356_0FF496C6D756D698">
poverty of the inhabitants &s;eemed to forbid a longer &s;tay than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for repo&s;e, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;light refre&s;hment. Spalatro led the way to a cabin, in which the few per&s;ons, that journied this road were u&s;ually entertained. The appearance of the people, who owned it, was as wild as their country, and the inter|ior of the dwelling was &s;o dirty and comfortle&s;s, that Schedoni, preferring to take his repa&s;t in the open air, a table was &s;pread under the luxuriant &s;hade of the fore&s;t-trees, at a little di&s;tance. Here, when the ho&s;t had withdrawn, and Spalatro had been di&s;patched to examine the po&s;t-hor&s;es, and to procure a lay-habit for the Confe&s;&s;or, the latter, once more alone with Ellena, began to experience again &s;omewhat of the embarra&s;&s;ments of con&s;cience; and Ellena, whenever her eyes glanced upon him, &s;uffered a &s;olemnity of fear that ro&s;e almo&s;t to terror. He, at length, termi|nated this emphatic &s;ilence, by renewing his mention of Vivaldi, and his command that Ellena &s;hould re|late the hi&s;tory of their affection. Not daring to refu&s;e, &s;he obeyed, but with as much brevity as po&s;|&s;ible, and Schedoni did not interrupt her by a &s;ingle ob&s;ervation. However eligible their nuptials now appeared to him, he forebore to give any hint of ap|probation, till he &s;hould have extricated the object of her regards from his perilous &s;ituation. But, with Ellena, this very &s;ilence implied the opinion it was meant to conceal, and, encouraged by the hope it im|parted, &s;he ventured once more to a&s;k, by who&s;e order Vivaldi had been arre&s;ted; whither he had been con|veyed, and the circum&s;tance of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Too politic to intru&s;t her with a knowledge of his actual condition, the Confe&s;&s;or &s;pared her the angui&s;h of learning that he was a pri&s;oner in the Inqui&s;ition. He affected ignorance of the late tran&s;action at Celano, but ventured to believe, that both Vivaldi and her&s;elf had been arre&s;ted by order of the Marche&s;a, who, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e
<PB N="67" REF="032735_0357_0FF4971E50249D38">
conjectured, had thrown him into temporary confine|ment, a mea&s;ure which &s;he, no doubt, had meant to en|force al&s;o towards Ellena.</P>
<P>"And you, my father," ob&s;erved Ellena, "what brought you to my pri&s;on,&mdash;you who was not inform|ed with the Marche&s;a's de&s;igns?&mdash;What accident conducted you to that remote &s;olitude, ju&s;t at the moment when you could &s;ave your child!"</P>
<P>"Informed of the Marche&s;a's de&s;igns!" &s;aid Sche|doni, with embarra&s;&s;ment and di&s;plea&s;ure: "Have you ever imagined that I could be acce&s;&s;ary&mdash;that I coul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> con&s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t, I mean could con&s;ent to be a confident of &s;uch atrocious"&mdash;Schedoni, bewildered, confounded, and half betrayed, checked him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Yet you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> have &s;aid, the Marche&s;a meant only to confine me!" ob&s;erved Ellena; "was that de&s;ign &s;o atrocious? Alas, my father! I know too well that her plan was more atrocious, and &s;ince you had too much rea&s;on to know this, why do you &s;ay that impri|&s;onment only was intended for me? But your &s;olicitude for my tranquillity leads you to?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"What means," interrupted the &s;u&s;picious Schedo|ni, "can I particularly have of under&s;tanding the Marche&s;a's &s;chemes? I repeat, that I am not her confi|dent; how, then, is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;hould know that they extended further than to impri&s;onment?"</P>
<P>"Did you not &s;ave me from the arm of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in!" &s;aid Ellena tenderly; "did not you wrench the very dagger from his gra&s;p!"</P>
<P>"I had forgotten, I had forgotten," &s;aid the Con|fe&s;&s;or, yet more embarra&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Yes, good minds are ever thus apt to forget the benefits they confer," replied Ellena. "But you &s;hall find, my father, that a greatful heart is equally tenacious to remember them; it is the indelible regi|&s;ter of every act that is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the memory of the benefactor."</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="032735_0358_0FF496C85D7B41A8">
"Mention no more of benefits." &s;aid Schedoni, impatiently; "let &s;ilence on this &s;ubject henceforth indicate your wi&s;h to oblige me."</P>
<P>He r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e, and joined the ho&s;t, who was at the door of his abin. Schedoni wi&s;hed to di&s;mi&s;s Spalatro as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and he enquired for a guide to con|duct him through that part of the fore&s;t, which re|mained to be traver&s;ed. In this poor town, a per&s;on willing to undertake that office was ea&s;ily to be found, but the ho&s;t went inque&s;t of a neighbour whom he had recommended.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Spalatro returned, without having &s;uc|ceeded in his commi&s;&s;ion. Not any lay-habit could be procured, upon &s;o &s;hort a notice, that &s;uited Sche|doni. He was obliged, therefore, to continue his journey to the next town at lea&s;t, in his own dre&s;s, but the nece&s;&s;ity was not very &s;erious to him, &s;ince it was improbable that he &s;hould be known in this ob&s;cure region.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently the ho&s;t appeared with his neighbour, when Schedoni, having received &s;atisfactory an&s;wers to his que&s;tions, engaged him for the remainder of the fore&s;t-road and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Spalatro, The ruffian de|parted with &s;ullen reluctance and evident ill will, cir|cum&s;tances which the Confe&s;&s;or &s;carcely noticed, while occupied by the &s;atisfaction of e&s;caping from the pre&s;ence of the atrocious partner of his con&s;cience. But Ellena, as he pa&s;&s;ed her, ob&s;erved the maligant di&s;appointment of his look, and it &s;erved only to heighten the thankfulne&s;s his departure occa&s;ioned her.</P>
<P>It was ofternoon before the travellers proceeded. Schedoni had calculated that they could ea&s;ily reach the town, at which they de&s;igned to pa&s;s the night, be|fore the clo&s;e of evening, and he had been in no ha&s;te to depart during the heat of the day. Their track now lay through a country le&s;s &s;avage, though &s;carcely le&s;s wild than that they had pa&s;&s;ed in the morning.

It emerged from the interior towards the border of the fore&s;t; they were no longer enclo&s;ed by impending mountains; the with drawing &s;hades were no longer impenetrable to the eye, but now and then opened to gleams of &s;un&s;hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e-land&s;cape, and blue di&s;tances; and in the immediate &s;cene, many a green glade &s;pread its bo&s;om to the &s;un. The grandeur of the trees, howe|ver, did not decline; the plane, the oak, and the che&s;|nut &s;till threw a pomp of foliage round the&s;e &s;miling &s;pots, and &s;eemed to con&s;ecrate the mountain &s;treams, that de&s;cended beneath their &s;olemn &s;hade.</P>
<P>To the harra&s;&s;ed &s;pirits of Ellena the changing &s;cenery was refre&s;hing and &s;he frequently yielded her cares to the influence of maje&s;tic nature. Over the gloom of Schedoni, no &s;cenery had, at any moment, power; the &s;hape and paint of external imagery gave neither impre&s;&s;ion nor colour to his fancy. He con|temned the &s;weet illu&s;ions, to which other &s;pirits are liable, and which often confer a delight more exqui|&s;ite and not le&s;s innocent, than any, which delibera|tive rea&s;on can be&s;tow.</P>
<P>The &s;ame thoughtful &s;ilence, that had wrapt him at the beginning of the journey, he &s;till pre&s;erved, ex|cept when occa&s;ionally he a&s;ked a que&s;tion of the guide concerning the way, and received an&s;wers too loqua|cious for his humour. This loquacity, however, was not ea&s;ily oppre&s;&s;ed, and the pea&s;ant had already begun to relate &s;ome terrible &s;tories of murder, com|mitted in the&s;e fore&s;ts upon people, who had been har|dy enough to venture into them without a guide, be|fore the again ab&s;tracted Schedoni even noticed that he &s;poke. Tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gh Ellena did give much credit to the&s;e narratives, they had &s;ome effect upon her fears, when &s;oon after &s;he entered the deep &s;hades of a part of the fore&s;t, that lay along a narrow defile, whence every glimp&s;e of cheerful land&s;cape was again exclud|ed by precipices, which towered on either &s;ide. The
<PB N="70" REF="032735_0360_0FF496D329C4B7F0">
&s;tilne&s;s was not le&s;s effectual than the gloom, for no &s;ounds were heard, except &s;uch as &s;eemed to charact|erize &s;olitude, and impre&s;s its awful power more deep|ly on the heart,&mdash;the hollow da&s;hing of torrents de&s;cending di&s;tantly, and the deep &s;ighings of the wind, as it pa&s;&s;ed among trees, which threw their broad arms over the cliffs, and crowned the highe&s;t &s;ummits. Onward, through the narrowing winding of the de|file, no living object appeared; but, as Ellena looked fearfully back, &s;he thought &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed a human figure, advancing beneath the du&s;ky umbrage that clo&s;ed the view. She communicated her &s;u&s;picion to Schedoni, though not her fears, and they &s;topped for a moment, to ob&s;erve further. The object advanced &s;lowly, and they perceived the &s;tature of a man, who, having continued to approach, &s;uddenly pau&s;ed, and then glided away behind the fol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">age that cro&s;&s;ed the per&s;pective, but not before Ellena fancied &s;he di&s;cri|minated the figure of Spalatro. None but a purpo&s;e the mo&s;t de&s;perate, &s;he believed, could have urged him to follow into this, in&s;tead of returning, as he had pre|tended, to his home. Yet it appeared improbable, that he alone &s;hould be willing to attack two armed per&s;ons, for both Schedoni and the guide had weapons of defence. This con&s;ideration afforded&punc; her only a momentary re&s;pite from apprehen&s;ion, &s;ince it was po&s;|&s;ible that he might not be alone, though only one per|&s;on had yet been &s;een among the &s;hrouding branches of the woods. "Did you not think he re&s;embled Spalatro?" &s;aid Ellena to the Confe&s;&s;or, "was he not of the &s;ame &s;tature and air? You are well armed, or I &s;hould fear for you, as well as for my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"I did not ob&s;erve a re&s;emblance," replied Schedoni, throwing a glance back, "but whoever he is, you have nothing to apprehend from him, for he has di&s;appear|ed."</P>
<P>"Yes, Signor, &s;o much the wor&s;e," ob&s;erved the
<PB N="71" REF="032735_0361_0FF4972160076AC8">
guide, "&s;o much the wor&s;e, if he means us any harm, for he can &s;teal along the rocks behind the&s;e thickets, and &s;trike out upon us before we are aware of him. Or, if he knows the path that runs among tho&s;e old oaks yonder, on the left where the ground ri&s;es, he has us &s;ure at the turning of the next cliff."</P>
<P>"Speak lower," &s;aid Schedoni, "unle&s;s you mean that he &s;hould benefit by your in&s;tructions."</P>
<P>Though the Confe&s;&s;or &s;aid this without any &s;u&s;pi|cion of evil intention from the guide, the man imme|diately began to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, and added, "I'll give him a hint of what he may expect, however, if he at|tacks us." As he &s;poke, he fired his trombone in the air, when every rock reverberated the &s;ound, and the faint and fainter thunder retired in murmurs through all the windings of the defile. The eagerne&s;s, with which the guide had ju&s;tified him&s;elf, produced an ef|fect upon Schedoni contrary to what he de&s;igned; and the Confe&s;&s;or, as he watched him &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly ob&s;erved, that after he had fired, he did not load his peace again. "Since you have given the enemy &s;ufficient intimation where to find us," &s;aid Schedoni, "you will do well to prepare for his reception; load again, friend. I have arms too, and they are ready."</P>
<P>While the man &s;ullenly obeyed, Ellena, again alarm|ed, looked back in &s;earch of the &s;tranger, but not any per&s;on appeared beneath the gloom, and no foot-&s;tep broke upon the &s;tilne&s;s. When, however, &s;he &s;udden|ly heard a ru&s;tling noi&s;e, &s;he looked to the bordering thickets, almo&s;t expecting to &s;ee Spalatro break from among them, before &s;he perceived that it was only the &s;ounding pinions of birds, which, &s;tartled by the re|port of the trombone from their high ne&s;ts in the cliffs, winged their way from danger.</P>
<P>The &s;u&s;picions of the Confe&s;&s;or had, probably, been &s;light, for they were tran&s;ient; and when Ellena next addre&s;&s;ed him, he had again retired within him&s;elf.

He was ruminating upon an excu&s;e to be offered the Marche&s;a, which might be &s;ufficient both to a&s;|&s;uage her di&s;appointment and baffle her curio&s;ity, and he could not, at pre&s;ent, fabricate one that might &s;oothe her re&s;entment without ri&s;k of betraying his &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Twilight had added its gloom to that &s;tate of the rocks, before the travellers di&s;tingui&s;hed the town, at which they meant to pa&s;s the night. It terminated the defile, and its grey hou&s;es could &s;carely be di&s;cern|ed from the precipice upon which they hung, or from the trees that embo&s;omed them. A rapid &s;tream roll|ed below, and over it a bridge conducted the wonder|ers to the little inn, at which they were to take up their abode. Here, quietly lodged, Ellena di&s;mi&s;&s;ed all pre&s;ent apprehen&s;ion of Spalatro, but &s;he &s;till be|lieved &s;he had &s;een him and her &s;u&s;picions, as to the motive of his extraordinary journey, were not appea&s;|ed.</P>
<P>As this was a town of ampler accommodation than the one they had left, Schedoni ea&s;ily procured a lay-habit, that would di&s;gui&s;e him for the remainder of the journey; and Ellena was permitted to lay a&s;ide the nun's veil, for one of a more general fa&s;hion; but, in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing it, &s;he did not forget that it had been the veil of Olivia, and &s;he pre&s;erved it as a &s;acred relique of her favourite reclu&s;e.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance between this town and Naples was &s;till that of &s;everal days journey, according to the u&s;ual mode of travelling; but the mo&s;t dangerous part of the way was now overcome, the road having emerged from the fore&s;ts; and when Schedoni, on the follow|ing morning was departing, he would have di&s;charg|ed the guide, had not the ho&s;t a&s;&s;ured him, he would find one &s;till nce&s;&s;ary in the open, but wild, country through which he mu&s;t pa&s;s. Schedoni's di&s;tru&s;t of this guide had never been very &s;erious, and, as the re|&s;ult of the preceding evening proved favourable, he
<PB N="73" REF="032735_0363_0FF4972C1BFBB628">
had re&s;tored him &s;o entirely to his confidence, as will|ingly to engage him for the pre&s;ent day. In this con|fidence, however, Ellena did not perfectly coincide; &s;he had ob&s;erved the man while he loaded the trombone on Schedoni's order, and his evident reluctance had almo&s;t per&s;uaded her, that he was in league with &s;ome per&s;on who de&s;igned to attack them; a conjecture, perhaps, the more readily admitted while her mind was &s;uffering from the impre&s;&s;ion of having &s;een Spa|latro. She now ventured to hint her di&s;tru&s;t to the Confe&s;&s;or, who paid little attention to it, and remind|ed her, that &s;ufficient proof of the man's hone&s;ty had appeared, in their having been permitted to pa&s;s in &s;afety, a defile &s;o convenient for the purpo&s;e of rapine as that of ye&s;terday. To a reply apparently &s;o rea|&s;onable, Ellena could oppo&s;e nothing, had &s;he even dared to pre&s;s the topic; and &s;he re-commenced the journey with gayer hopes.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ON this day, Schedoni was more communicative than on the preceding one. While they rode apart from the guide, he conver&s;ed with Ellena on va|rious topics relative to her&s;elf, but without once al|luding to Vivaldi; and even conde&s;cended to mention his de&s;ign of di&s;po&s;ing of her in a convent at &s;ome di&s;tance from Naples, till it &s;hould be convenient for him to acknowledge her for his daughter. But the difficulty of finding a &s;uitable &s;ituation embarra&s;&s;ed him, and he was di&s;concerted by the aukwardne&s;s of introducing her him&s;elf to &s;trangers, who&s;e curio&s;ity would be heightened by a &s;en&s;e of their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances induced him the more ea&s;ily to attend to the di&s;tre&s;s of Ellena, on her learning, that &s;he was again to be placed at a di&s;tance from her home, and among &s;trangers; and the more willingly to li&s;ten to the account &s;he gave of the convent of Santa Maria della Pieta, and to her reque&s;t of returning thither. But in whatever-degree he might be inclined to ap|prove, he li&s;tened without con&s;enting, and Ellena had only the con&s;olation of perceiving that he was not ab|&s;olutely determined to adopt his fir&s;t plan.</P>
<P>Her thoughts were too deeply engaged upon her fu|ture pro&s;pects to permit lei&s;ure for pre&s;ent fears, or probably &s;he would have &s;uffered &s;ome return of tho&s;e of ye&s;terday, in traver&s;ing the lonely plains and rude vallies, through which the road lay. Schedoni was thankful to the landlord, who had advi&s;ed him to keep
<PB N="75" REF="032735_0365_0FF4972DAB58DCE0">
the guide, the road being frequently ob&s;cured among&s;t the wild heaths that &s;tretched around, and the eye often &s;weeping over long tracts of country, without perceiving a villiage or any human dwelling.&mdash;Dur|ing the whole morning, they had not met one travel|ler, and they continued to proceed beneath the heat of noon, becau&s;e Schedoni had been unable to di&s;cover even a cottage, in which &s;helter and repo&s;e might be obtained,</P>
<P>It was late in the day when the guide pointed out the grey walls of an edifice which crowned the acclivi|ty they were approaching. But this was &s;o &s;hrouded among woods, than no feature of it could be di&s;tinctly &s;een, and it did but &s;lightly awaken their hopes of ap|proaching a convent, which might receive them with ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>The high banks over&s;hadowed with thickets, be|tween which the road a&s;cended, &s;oon excluded even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> glimp&s;e of the walls, but, as the travellers turned the next projection, they perceived a per&s;on on the &s;um|mit of the road, cro&s;&s;ing as if towards &s;ome place of re&s;idence, and concluded that the edifice they had &s;een was behind the trees, among which he had di&s;|appeared.</P>
<P>A few moments brought them to the &s;pot, where, retired at a &s;hort di&s;tance mong the woods that brow|ed the hill, they di&s;covered the exten&s;ive remains of what &s;eemed to have been a villa, and which, from the air of de&s;olation it exhibited, Schedoni would have judged to be wholly de&s;erted, had he not already &s;een a per&s;on enter. Wearied and exhau&s;ted, he determined to a&s;certain whether any refre&s;hment could be procured from the inhabitants within, and the party alighted be|fore the portal of a deep and broad avenue of arched &s;tone, which &s;eemed to have been the grand approach to the villa. The entrance was ob&s;tructed by fallen fragments of columns, and by the underwood that had
<PB N="76" REF="032735_0366_0FF496D7C1A46130">
taken root among&s;t them. The travellers, however, ea&s;ily overcame the&s;e interruptions: but as the avenue was of con&s;iderable extent, and as its only light pro|ceeded from the portal, except what a few narrow loops in the walls admitted, they &s;oon found them&s;elves involved in an ob&s;curity that rendered the way diffi|cult, and Schedoni endeavoured to make him&s;elf heard by the per&s;on he had &s;een. The effort was un&s;ucce&s;s|ful, but as they proceeded, a bend in the pa&s;&s;age &s;hewed a di&s;tant glimmering of light, which &s;erved to guide them to the oppo&s;ite entrance, where an arch opened immediately into a court of the villa. Schedoni pau&s;|ed here in di&s;appointment, for every object &s;eemed to bear evidence of abandonment and de&s;olation; and he looked, almo&s;t hopele&s;sly, round the light colonnade which ran along three &s;ides of the court, and to the trees that waved over the fourth, in &s;earch of the per|&s;on, who had been &s;een from the road. No human figure &s;tole upon the vacancy; yet the apt fears of Ellena almo&s;t imagined the form of Spalatro gliding behind the columns, and &s;he &s;tarted as the air &s;hook over the wild plants that wreathed them, before &s;he di&s;covered that is was not the &s;ound of &s;teps, At the extravagance of her &s;u&s;picions, however, and the weakne&s;s of her terrors, &s;he blu&s;hed, and endeavoured to re&s;i&s;t that propen&s;ity to fear, which nerves long pre&s;&s;ed upon had occa&s;ioned in her mind.</P>
<P>Schedoni, meanwhile, &s;tood in the court, like the evil &s;pirit of the place, examining its de&s;olation, and endeavouring to a&s;certain whether any per&s;on lurked in the interior of the building.&mdash;Several door-ways in the colonade appeared to lead in chambers of the villa, and, after a &s;hort he&s;itation, Schedoni, having deter|mined to pur&s;ue his enquiry, entered one of them, and pa&s;&s;ed through a marble hall to a &s;uite of rooms, who&s;e condition told how long it was &s;ince they had been inhabited. The roofs had entirely vani&s;hed, and even
<PB N="77" REF="032735_0367_0FF4972F345523F8">
portions of the walls had fallen, and lay in ma&s;&s;es among&s;t the woods without.</P>
<P>Perceiving that it was as u&s;ele&s;s as difficult to pro|ceed, the Confe&s;&s;or returned to the court, where the &s;hade of the palmetos, at lea&s;t, offered an ho&s;pitable &s;helter to the wearied travellers. They repo&s;ed them|&s;elves beneath the branches, on &s;ome fragments of a marble fountain, whence the court opened to the ex|ten&s;ive land&s;cape, now mellowed by the evening beams, and partook of the remains of a repa&s;t, which had been depo&s;ited in the wallet of the guide.</P>
<P>"This place appears to have &s;uffered from an earth|quake, rather than from time," &s;aid Schedoni, "for the walls, though &s;hattered, do not &s;eem to have decay|ed, and, much that has been &s;trong, lies in ruin, while what is comparatively &s;light remains uninjured; the&s;e are certainly &s;ymptoms of partial &s;hocks of the earth. Do you know any thing of the hi&s;tory of this place, friend?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Signor," replied the guide.</P>
<P>"Relate it, then,"</P>
<P>"I &s;hall never forget the earthquake that de&s;troy|ed it Signor; for it was felt all through the Gargan|us. I was then about &s;ixteen, and I remember it was near an hour before midnight that the great &s;hock was felt. The weather had been almo&s;t &s;tifling for &s;everal days, &s;carcely a breath of air had &s;tirred, and &s;light tremblings of the ground were noticed by many people. I had been out all day, cutting wood in the fore&s;t with my father, and tired enough we were, when&mdash;"</P>
<P>"This is the hi&s;tory of your&s;elf," &s;aid Schedoni, interrupting him, "Who did this place belong to?"</P>
<P>"Did any per&s;on &s;uffer here?" &s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P>"The Barone di Cambru&s;a lived here," replied the guide,</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="032735_0368_0FF496E237A986E8">
"Hah! the Barone!" repeated Schedoni, and &s;unk into one of his accu&s;tomary fits of ab&s;traction.</P>
<P>"He was a Signor little loved in the country," continued the guide, "and &s;ome people &s;aid it was a judgment upon him for&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Was it not rather a judgment upon the country," interrupted the Confe&s;&s;or, lifting up his head, and then &s;inking again into &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"I know not for that, Signor, but he had committed crimes enough to make one's hair &s;tand on end. It was here that he&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Fools are always wondering at the actions of tho&s;e above them," &s;aid Schedoni, te&s;tily; "Where is the Barone now.</P>
<P>"I cannot tell, Signor, but mo&s;t likely where he de&s;erves to be, for he has never been heard of &s;ince the night of the earthquake, and it is believed he was bu|ried under the ruins."</P>
<P>"Did any other per&s;on &s;uffer?" repeated Ellena.</P>
<P>"You &s;hall hear, Signora," replied the pea&s;ant, "I happen to know &s;omething about the matter, becau&s;e a cou&s;in of our's lived in the family at that time, and my father has often told me all about it, as well as of the late lords goings-on. It was near midnight when the great &s;hock came, and the family, thinking of no|thing at all, had &s;upped and been a&s;leep &s;ome time, Now it happened that the Barone's chamber was in a tower of the old building, at which people often won|derered, becau&s;e, &s;aid they, why &s;hould he choo&s;e to &s;leep in the old part where there are &s;o many fine rooms in the new villa? but &s;o it was."</P>
<P>"Come, di&s;patch your meal," &s;aid Schedoni, awake|ing from his deep mu&s;ing," "the &s;un is &s;etting, and we have yet far to go."</P>
<P>"I will fini&s;h the meal and the &s;tory together, Sig|nor, with your leave," replied the guide.&mdash;Schedoni did not notice what he &s;aid, and as the man was not forbidden, he proceeded with his relation.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="032735_0369_0FF49731AAEB26F0">
"Now it happened that the Barone's chamber was in that old tower,&mdash;if you will look this way, Signo|ra, you may &s;ee what is left of it."</P>
<P>Ellena turned her attention to where the guide pointed, and perceived the &s;hattered remains of a tow|er ri&s;ing beyond the arch, through which &s;he had en|tered the court.</P>
<P>"You &s;ee that corner of a window-ca&s;e left, in the highe&s;t part of the wall, Signora," continued the guide, "ju&s;t by that tuft of a&s;h, that grows out of the &s;tone."</P>
<P>"I ob&s;erve," &s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P>"Well, that was one of the windows of the very chamber, Signora, and you &s;ee &s;carcely any thing el&s;e is left of it. Yes, there is the door-ca&s;e, too, but the door it&s;elf is gone; that little &s;tair-ca&s;e, which you &s;ee beyond it, led up to another &s;tory, which nobody now would gue&s;s had ever been; for roof and flooring, and all are fallen. I wonder how that little &s;tair-ca&s;e in the corner happened to hold &s;o fa&s;t!"</P>
<P>"Have you almo&s;t done?" inquired Schedoni, who had not apparently attended to any thing the man &s;aid, and now alluded to the refre&s;hment he was taking.</P>
<P>"Yes, Signor, I have not a great deal more to tell, or to eat either, for that matter," replied the guide; "but you &s;hall hear. Well, yonder was the very chamber, Signora, at that door-ca&s;e, which is &s;till in the wall, the Barone came in, ah! he little thought, I warrant, that he &s;hould never more go out at it! How long he had been in the room I do not know, nor whether he was a &s;leep or awake, for there is no|body that can tell; but when the great &s;hock came, it &s;plit the old tower at once, before any other part of the buildings. You &s;ee that heap of ruins, yonder, on the ground, Signora, there lie there mains of the chamber; the Barone, they &s;ay, was buried under them!"</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="032735_0370_0FF496E3C25EA4C8">
Ellena &s;huddered while &s;he gazed upon this de|&s;tructive ma&s;s. A groan from Schedoni &s;tartled her and &s;he turnned towards him, but, as he appeared &s;hrouded in meditation, &s;he again directed her atten|tion to this awful memorial. As her eye pa&s;&s;ed upon the neighbouring arch, &s;he was &s;truck with the gran|deur of its proportions, and with its &s;ingular appear|ance, now that the evening rays glanced upon the over|hanging &s;hrubs, and darted a line of partial light ath|wart the avenue beyond. But what was her emotion, when &s;he perceived a per&s;on gliding away in the per|&s;pective of the avenue, and, as he cro&s;&s;ed where the gleam fell, di&s;tingui&s;hed the figure and countenance of Spalatro! She had &s;carcely power, faintly to ex|claim, "Steps go there!" before he had di&s;appeared; and, when Schedoni looked round, the vacuity and &s;ilence of &s;olitude every where prevailed.</P>
<P>Ellena now did not &s;cruple po&s;itively to affirm that &s;he had &s;een Spalatro, and Schedoni fully &s;en&s;ible, that if her imagination had not deluded her, the purpo&s;e of his thus tracing their route mu&s;t be de&s;perate, immedi|ately ro&s;e, and, followed by the pea&s;ant, pa&s;&s;ed into the avenue to a&s;certain the truth, leaving Ellena alone in the court. He had &s;carcely di&s;appeared before the danger of his adventuring into that ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;age. where an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in might &s;trike un&s;een, forcibly occur|red to Ellena, and &s;he loudly conjured him to return. She li&s;tened for his voice, but heard only his retreat|ing &s;teps; when, too anxious to remain where &s;he was, &s;he ha&s;tened to the entrance of the avenue. But all was now hu&s;hed; neither voice, nor &s;teps were di|&s;tingui&s;hed. Awed by the gloom of the place, &s;he feared to venture further, yet almo&s;t equally dreaded to remain alone in any part of the ruin, while a man &s;o de&s;perate as Spalatro was hovering about it.</P>
<P>As &s;he yet li&s;tened at the entrance of the avenue, a faint cry, which &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue from the interior of
<PB N="81" REF="032735_0371_0FF4973B02528738">
the villa, reached her. The fir&s;t dreadful &s;urmi&s;e that &s;truck Ellena was, that they were murdering her fa|ther, who had probably been decoyed, by another pa&s;|&s;age, back into &s;ome chamber of the ruin; when, in|&s;tantly forgetting every fear for her&s;elf, &s;he ha&s;tened towards the &s;pot whence &s;he judged the &s;ound to have i&s;&s;ued. She entered the hall, which Schedoni had no|ticed, and pa&s;&s;ed on through a &s;uit of apartments be|yond. Every thing here, however, was &s;ilent, and the place apparently de&s;erted. The &s;uit terminated in a pa&s;&s;age, that &s;eemed to lead to a di&s;tant part of the villa, and Ellena, after a momentary he&s;itation, deter|mined to follow it.</P>
<P>She made her way with difficulty between the half-demoli&s;hed walls, and was obliged to attend &s;o much to her &s;teps, that &s;he &s;carcely noticed whither &s;he was going, till the depening &s;hade of the place recalling her attention, &s;he perceived her&s;elf among the ruins of the tower, who&s;e hi&s;tory had been related by the guide; and, on looking up, ob&s;erved &s;he was at the foot of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, which &s;till wound up the wall, that had led to the chamber of the Barone.</P>
<P>At a moment le&s;s anxious, the circum&s;tance would have affected her; but now &s;he could only repeat her calls upon the name of Schedoni, and li&s;ten for &s;ome &s;ignal that he was near. Still receiving no an&s;wer, nor hearing any further &s;ound of di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he began to hope that her fears had deceived her, and having a&s;|certained that the pa&s;&s;age terminated here, &s;he quitted the &s;pot.</P>
<P>On regaining the fir&s;t chamber, Ellena re&s;ted for a moment to recover breath; and, while &s;he leaned upon what had once been a window, opening to the court, &s;he heard a di&s;tant report of fire-arms. The &s;ound &s;welled, and &s;eemed to revolve along the avenue through which Schedoni had di&s;appeared.&mdash;Sup|po&s;ing that the combatants were engaged at the farthe&s;t
<PB N="82" REF="032735_0372_0FF496E54BFDB3C0">
entrance, Ellena was preparing to go thither, when a &s;udden &s;tep moved near her, and on turning, &s;he di&s;|covered with a degree of horror that almo&s;t depriv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> her of recollection, Spalatro him&s;elf, &s;tealing along the very chamber in which &s;he was.</P>
<P>That part of the room which he &s;tood in fell into a kind of rece&s;s; and whether it was this circum|&s;tance that prevented him from immediately perceiv|ing her, or that, his chief purpo&s;e being directed a|gain&s;t another object, he did not choo&s;e to pau&s;e here, he pa&s;&s;ed on with &s;kulking &s;teps; and, before Ellena had determined whither to go, &s;he ob&s;erved him cro&s;s the court before her, and enter the avenue. As he had pa&s;&s;ed, he looked up at the window; and it was certain he then &s;aw her, for he in&s;tantly faultered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the next moment proceeded &s;wiftly, and di&s;appear in the gloom.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed that he had not yet encountered Schedoni, but it al&s;o occured to Ellena that he was gone into the avenue for the purpo&s;e of waiting to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him in the darkne&s;s. While &s;he was meditating &s;ome means of giving the Confe&s;&s;or a timely alarm of his danger, &s;he once more di&s;tingui&s;hed his voice. It ap|proached from the avenue, and Ellena immediately cal|ling aloud that Spalatro was there, entreated him to be on his guard. In the next in&s;tant a pi&s;tol was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ired there.</P>
<P>Among the voices that &s;ucceeded the report, Ellena thought &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed groans. Schedoni's voice was in the next moment heard again, but it &s;eemed faint and low, The courage which &s;he had before exerted was now exhau&s;ted; &s;he remained fixed to the &s;pot, unable to encounter the dreadful &s;pectacle that&punc; probably awaited her in the avenue, and al|mo&s;t &s;inking beneath the expectation of it.</P>
<P>All was now hu&s;hed; &s;he li&s;tened for Schedoni's voice, and even for a foot&s;tep, in vain. To endure this
<PB N="83" REF="032735_0373_0FF4973C88A6E7A0">
&s;tate of uncertainty much longer was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible, and Ellena was edenavouring to collect fortitude to meet a knowledge of the wor&s;t, when &s;uddenly a feeble groaning was again heard. It &s;eemed near, and to be approaching &s;till nearer. At that moment, Ellena, on looking towards the avenue, perceived a figure covered with blood, pa&s;s into the court. A film, which drew over her eyes, prevented her noticing farther, &s;he tottered a few paces back, and caught at the frag|ment of a pillar, by which &s;he &s;upported her&s;elf. The weakne&s;s was tran&s;ient; immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance ap|peared nece&s;&s;ary to the wounded per&s;on, and pity &s;oon predominating over horror, &s;he recalled her &s;pirits, and ha&s;tened to the court.</P>
<P>When on reaching it, &s;he looked round in &s;earch of Schedoni, he was no where to be &s;een; the court was again &s;olitary and &s;ilent, till &s;he awakened all its echoes with the name of <HI>father.</HI> While &s;he repeated her calls, &s;he ha&s;tily examined the colonnade, the &s;eparated chamber which opened immediately from it, and the &s;hadow ground beneath the palmetos, but without di&s;covering any per&s;on.</P>
<P>As &s;he turned towards the avenue, however, a tract of blood on the ground told her too certainly where the wounded per&s;on had pa&s;&s;ed. It guided her to the entrance of a narrow pa&s;&s;age, that &s;eemingly led to the foot of the tower; but here &s;he he&s;itated, fearing to tru&s;t the ob&s;curity beyond. For the fir&s;t time, El|lena conjectured, that not Schedoni, but Spalatro might be the per&s;on &s;he had &s;een, and that, though he was wounded, vengeance might give him, &s;trength to &s;trike his &s;tilletto at the heart of whom&s;oever ap|proached him, while the du&s;kine&s;s of the place would favour the deed.</P>
<P>She was yet at the entrance of the pa&s;&s;age fearful to enter, and reluctant to leave it, li&s;tening for a &s;ound, and &s;till hearing at intervals, &s;welling though feeble

groans; when quick&s;teps were &s;uddenly heard advanc|ing up the grand avenue, and pre&s;ently her own name was repeated loudly in the voice of Schedoni. His manner was hurried as he advanced to meet her, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he threw an eager glance round the court. "We mu&s;t be gone," &s;aid he, in a low tone, and taking her arm within his. "Have you &s;een any one pa&s;s!"</P>
<P>"I have &s;een a wounded man enter the court," re|plied Ellena, "and feared he was your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Where?&mdash;Which way did he go!" inquired Schedoni, eagerly, while his eyes glowed&punc; and his countenance became fell,</P>
<P>Ellena in&s;tantly comprehending his motive for the que&s;tion, would not acknowledge that &s;he knew whi|ther Spalatro had withdrawn; and, reminding him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">of the danger of their &s;ituation, &s;he entreated that they might quit the villa immediately.</P>
<P>"The &s;un is already &s;et," &s;he added. "I tremble at what may be the perils of this place at &s;uch an ob|&s;cure hour, and even at what may be tho&s;e of our road at a later!"</P>
<P>"You are &s;ure he was wounded?" &s;aid the Con|fe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"Too &s;ure," replied Ellena, faintly.</P>
<P>"Too &s;ure!" &s;ternly exclaimed Schedoni.</P>
<P>"Let us depart, my father; O let us go this in|&s;tant!" repeated Ellena.</P>
<P>"What is the meaning of all this!" a&s;ked Schedo|ni, with anger. You cannot, &s;urely, have the weak|ne&s;s to pity this fellow!"</P>
<P>"It is terrible to &s;ee any one &s;uffer," &s;aid Ellena. "Do not, by remaining here, leave me a po&s;&s;ibility of grieving for you. What angui&s;h it would occa&s;ion you to &s;ee me bleed; judge then, what mu&s;t be mine, if you are wounded by the dagger of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in!"</P>
<P>Schedoni &s;tifled the groan which &s;welled from his heart, and abruptly turned away.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="032735_0375_0FF4973E0DACB3B0">
"You trifle with me," he &s;aid, in the next mo|ment: "you do not know that the villain is wound|ed. I fired at him, it is true, at the in&s;tant I &s;aw him enter the avenue, but he has e&s;caped me. What rea&s;on have you for your &s;uppo&s;ition?"</P>
<P>Ellena was going to point to the tract of blood on the ground, at a little di&s;tance, but checked her&s;elf; con&s;idering that this might guide him on to Spala|tro, and again &s;he entreated they might depart, ad|ding, "O! &s;pare your&s;elf, and him!"</P>
<P>"What! &s;pare an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in!" &s;aid Schedoni, impa|tiently,</P>
<P>"An a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in! He <HI>has,</HI> then, attempted your life?" exclaimed Ellena.</P>
<P>"Why no, not ab&s;olutely that," &s;aid Schedoni, recol|lecting him&s;elf,&mdash;"but what does the fellow do here? Let me pa&s;s, I will find him.</P>
<P>Ellena &s;till hung upon his garment, while with per&s;ua&s;ive tenderne&s;s, &s;he endeavoured to awaken his humanity. "O! if you had ever known what it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> expect in&s;tant death," &s;he continued, "you would pity this man now, as he, perhaps has &s;ome times pitied others! I have known &s;uch &s;uffering, my fath|er, and can therefore, feel even for him!"</P>
<P>"Do you know for <HI>whom</HI> you are pleading?" &s;aid the di&s;tracted Schedoni, while every word &s;he had ut|tered &s;eemed to have penetrated his heart. The &s;ur|pri&s;e which this que&s;tion awakened in Ellena's coun|tenance, recalled him to a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his impru|dence: he recollected that Ellena did not certainly know the office, with which Spalatro had been com|mi&s;&s;ioned again&s;t her: and when he con&s;idered that this very Spalatro whom Ellena had with &s;uch &s;implicity &s;uppo&s;ed to have, at &s;ome time &s;pared a life through pity, had in truth &s;pared her own, and, yet more, had been eventually a means of preventing him from de|&s;troying his own child, the Confe&s;&s;or turned in hor|ror

from his de&s;ign; all his pa&s;&s;ions changed, and he abruptly quitted the court, nor pau&s;ed till he reached the farthe&s;t extremity of the avenue, where the guide was in waiting with the hor&s;es.</P>
<P>A recollection of the conduct of Spalatro re&s;pecting Ellena had thus induced Schedoni to &s;pare him; but this was all; it did not prevail with him to enquire into the condition of this man, or to mitigate his puni&s;hment; and, without remor&s;e, he now left him to his fate.</P>
<P>With Ellena it was otherwi&s;e; though &s;he was ignorant of the obligation &s;he owed him, &s;he could not know that any human being was left under &s;uch circum&s;tances of &s;uffering and &s;olitude, without ex|periencing very painful emotions; but con&s;idering how expeditiou&s;ly Spalatro had been able to remove him&s;elf, &s;he endeavoured to hope that his wound was not mortal.</P>
<P>The travellers, mounting their hor&s;es in &s;ilence, left the ruin, and were for &s;ome time too much engaged by the impre&s;&s;ion of the late occurrences, to conver&s;e together. When, at length, Ellena inquired the par|ticulars of what had pa&s;&s;ed in the avenue, &s;he under|&s;tood that Schedoni, on pur&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing Spalatro, had &s;een him there only for a moment. Spalatro had e&s;caped by &s;ome way unknown to the Confe&s;&s;or, and had regained the interior of the ruin, while his pur&s;urers were yet following the avenue. The cry, which El|lena had imagined to proceed from the interior, was uttered, as it now appeared, by the guide, who, in his ha&s;te, had fallen over &s;ome fragments of the wall that lay &s;cattered in the avenue: the fir&s;t report of arms had been from the trombone, which Schedoni had di&s;charged on reaching the portal; and the la&s;t, when he fired a pi&s;tol, on perceiving Spalatro pa&s;&s;ing from the court.</P>
<P>"We have had trouble enough in running after this

fellow," &s;aid the guide, "and could not catch him at la&s;t. It is &s;trange, that if he came to look for us, he &s;hould run away &s;o when he had found us! I do not think he meant us any harm, after all, el&s;e he might have done it ea&s;ily enough in that dark pa&s;&s;age; in|&s;tead whereof he only took to his heels!"</P>
<P>"Silence!" &s;aid Schedoni, "fewer words, friend."</P>
<P>"Well, Signor, he's peppered now, however; &s;o we need not be afraid; his wings are clipped for one while, &s;o he cannot overtake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s. We need not be in &s;uch a hurry, Signor, we &s;hall get to the inn in good time yet. It is upon a mountain yonder, who&s;e top you may &s;ee upon that red &s;treak in the we&s;t. He cannot come after us; I my&s;elf &s;aw his arm was wounded."</P>
<P>"Did you &s;o?" &s;aid Schedoni, &s;harply:" and pray where was you when you &s;aw &s;o much? It was more than I &s;aw."</P>
<P>"I was clo&s;e at your heels, Signor, when you fired the pi&s;tol."</P>
<P>"I do not remember to have heard you there," ob|&s;erved the Confe&s;&s;or: "and why did you not come for|ward, in&s;tead of retreating? And where, al&s;o, did you hide your&s;elf while I was &s;earching for the fellow, in|&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting me in the pur&s;uit?"</P>
<P>The guide gave no an&s;wer, and Ellena, who had been attentively ob&s;erving him during the whole of this conver&s;ation, perceived that he was now con&s;i|derably emba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ra&s;&s;ed; &s;o that her former &s;u&s;picions as to his integrity began to revive, notwith&s;tanding the &s;e|veral circum&s;tances, which had occured to render them improbable. There was, however, at pre&s;ent no opportunity for further ob&s;ervation, Schedoni ha|ving, contrary to the advice of the guide, immediately quickened his pace, and the hor&s;es continuing on the full gallop, till a &s;teep a&s;cent compelled them to relax their &s;peed.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="032735_0378_0FF496F2ED12C5C8">
Contrary to his u&s;ual habit, Schedoni now, while they &s;lowly a&s;cended, appeared de&s;irous of conver&s;ing with this man, and a&s;ked him &s;everal que&s;tions rela|tive to the villa they had left; and, whether it was that he really felt an intere&s;t on the &s;ubject, or that he wi&s;hed to di&s;cover if the man had deceived him in the circum&s;tances he had already narrated, from which he might form a judgment as to his general character, he pre&s;&s;ed his enquiries with a patient minutene&s;s, that &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed Ellena. During this con|ver&s;ation, the deep twilight would no longer permit her to notice the countenances of either Schedoni, or the guide, but &s;he gave much attention to the chang|ing tones of their voices, as different circum&s;tances and emotions &s;eemed to affect them. It is to be ob|&s;erved, that during the whole of this di&s;cour&s;e, the guide rode at the &s;ide of Schedoni.</P>
<P>While the Confe&s;&s;or appeared to be mu&s;ing upon &s;omething which the pea&s;ant had related re&s;pecting the Barone di Cambru&s;ca, Ellena inquired as to the fate of the other inhabitants of the villa,</P>
<P>"The falling of the old tower was enough for them," replied the guide; "the cra&s;h waked them all directly, and they had time to get out of the new buildings, before the &s;econd and third &s;hocks laid them al&s;o in in ruins. They ran out into the woods for &s;afety, and found it too, for they happened to take a different road from the earthquake. Not a &s;oul &s;uf|fered, except the Barone, and he de&s;erved it well enough. O! I could tell &s;uch things that I have heard of him!&mdash;"</P>
<P>"What became of the re&s;t of the family?" inter|rupted Schedoni.</P>
<P>"Why, Signor, they were &s;cattered here and there, and every where; and they none of them ever re|turned to the old &s;pot. No! no! they had &s;uffered enough there already, and might have &s;uffered to this day, if the earthquake had not happened."</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="032735_0379_0FF4974C92DA7638">
"If it had <HI>not</HI> happened!" repeated Ellena.</P>
<P>"Aye, Signora, for that put an end to the Barone. If tho&s;e walls could but &s;peak, they would tell &s;trange things for they have looked upon &s;ad doings: and that chamber, which I &s;hewed you, Signora, nobody ever went into it but him&s;elf, except the &s;ervant to kept it in order, and that he would &s;carcely &s;uffer, and al|ways &s;taid in the room the while."</P>
<P>"He had probably trea&s;ure &s;ecreted there," &s;aid El|lena.</P>
<P>"No, Signora, no trea&s;ure! He had always a lamp burning there; and &s;ometimes in the night he has been heard&mdash;Once, indeed, his valet happened to&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Come on," &s;aid Schedoni, interrupted him; "keep pace with me. What idle dream are you relating now?"</P>
<P>"It is about the Barone di Cambru&s;ca, Signor, him that you was a&s;king me &s;o much about ju&s;t now. I was &s;aying what &s;trange ways he had, and how that, on one &s;tormy night in December, as my cou&s;in Fran|ci&s;co told my father, who told me, and he lived in the family at the time it happened&mdash;"</P>
<P>"What happened?" &s;aid Schedoni, ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>"What I am going to tell, Signor. My cou&s;in lived there at the time; &s;o, however <HI>unbelievable</HI> it may &s;eem, you may depend upon it, it is all true. My father knows I would not believe it my&s;elf till&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Enough of this," &s;aid Schedoni; "no more. What family had this Barone&mdash;had he a wife at the time of this de&s;tructive &s;hock?"</P>
<P>"Yes, truly, Signor, he had, as I was going to tell, if you would but conde&s;cend to have patience."</P>
<P>"The Barone had more need of that, friend; I have no wife."&mdash;"The Barone's wife had mo&s;t need of it, Signor, as you &s;hall hear. A good &s;oul, they &s;ay, was the Barone&s;&s;a! but luckily &s;he died many years
<PB N="90" REF="032735_0380_0FF496F473975620">
before. He had a daughter, al&s;o, and, young as &s;he was, &s;he had lived too long, but for the earthquake which &s;et her free."</P>
<P>"How far is it to the inn?" &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or, roughly.</P>
<P>"When we get to the top of this hill, Signor, you will &s;ee it on the next, if any light is &s;tirring, for there will only be the hollow between us. But do not be alarmed, Signor, the fellow we left cannot overtake us. Do you know much about him, Signor?"</P>
<P>Schedoni inquired whether the trombone was char|ed; and, di&s;covering that it was not, ordered the man to load immediately.</P>
<P>"Why, Signor, if you knew as much of him as I do, you could not be more afraid!" &s;aid the pea&s;ant, while he &s;topped to obey the order.</P>
<P>"I under&s;tood that he was a &s;tranger to you!" ob&s;erved the Confe&s;&s;or, with &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>"Why, Signor, he is, and he is not; I know more about him than he things for."</P>
<P>"You &s;eem to know a va&s;t deal too much of other per&s;ons affairs," &s;aid Schedoni, in a tone that was meant to &s;ilence him.</P>
<P>"Why, that is ju&s;t what he would &s;ay, Signor; but bad deeds will out, whether people like them to be known or not. This man comes to our town &s;ome|times to market, and nobody knew where he came from for a long while; &s;o they &s;et them&s;elves to work and found it out at la&s;t."</P>
<P>"We &s;hall never reach the &s;ummit of this hill," &s;aid Schedoni, te&s;tily.</P>
<P>"And they found out, too, a great many &s;trange things about him," continued the guide.</P>
<P>Ellena, who had attended to this di&s;cour&s;e with a degree of curio&s;ity that was painful, now li&s;tened im|patiently for what might be farther mentioned con|cerning Spalatro, but without daring to invite, by a

&s;ingle que&s;tion, any di&s;covery on a &s;ubject which ap|peared to be &s;o intimately connected with Schedoni.</P>
<P>"It was many years ago," rejoined the guide. "that this man came to live in that &s;trange hou&s;e on the &s;ea-&s;hore. It had been &s;hut up ever &s;ince&mdash;"</P>
<P>"What are you talking of now?" interrupted the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"Why, Signor, you never will let me tell you. You always &s;nap me up &s;o &s;hort at the beginning, and then a&s;k&mdash;what am I talking about! I was going to begin the &s;tory, and it is a pretty long one. But fir&s;t of all, Signor, who do you &s;uppo&s;e this man belonged to! And what do you think the people determined to do, when the report was fir&s;t &s;et a going? only they could not be &s;ure it was true, and any body would be unwilling enough to believe &s;uch a &s;hocking&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I have no curio&s;ity on the &s;ubject," replied the Confe&s;&s;or, &s;ternly interrupting him; "and de&s;ire to hear no more concerning it."</P>
<P>"I meant no harm, Signor," &s;aid the man; "I did not know it concerned you."</P>
<P>"And who &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s that it does concern me!"</P>
<P>"Nobody, Signor, only you &s;eemed to be in a bit of a pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;o I though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;But I meant no harm, Signor, only as he happened to be your guide part of the way, I gue&s;&s;ed you might like to know &s;omething of him."</P>
<P>"All that I de&s;ire to know of my guide is, that he does his duty," replied Schedoni "that he conducts me &s;afely, and under&s;tands when to be &s;ilent."</P>
<P>To this the man replied nothing, but &s;lackened his pace, and &s;lunk behind his reprover.</P>
<P>The travellers reaching, &s;oon after, the &s;ummit of this long hill, looked out for the inn of which they had been told; but darkne&s;s now confounded every object, and no dome&s;tic light twinkling, however di&s;|tantly, through the gloom, gave &s;ignal of &s;ecurity and
<PB N="92" REF="032735_0382_0FF4974F9EFA6798">
comfort. They de&s;cended dejectedly into the hollow of the mountains, and found them&s;elves once more immerged in woods. Schedoni again called the pea|&s;ant to his &s;ide, and bade him to keep abrea&s;t of him, but he did not di&s;cour&s;e; and Ellena was too thought|ful to attempt conver&s;ation. The hints which the guide had thrown out re&s;pecting Spalatro, had increa&s;|ed her curio&s;ity on that &s;ubject, but the conduct of Schedoni, his impatience, his embarra&s;&s;ment, and the deci&s;ive manner in which he had put an end to the talk of the guide, excited a degree of &s;urprize, that bordered on a&s;toni&s;hment. As &s;he had, however, no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to lead her conjectures to any point, &s;he was utterly bewildered in &s;urmi&s;e, under&s;tanding only that Sche|doni had been much more deeply connected with Spalatro than &s;he had hitherto believed.</P>
<P>The travellers having de&s;cended into the hollow, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> commenced the a&s;cent of the oppo&s;ite height, without di&s;covering any &s;ymptom of a neighbouring town, began again to fear that their conductor&punc; had deceive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> them. It was now &s;o dark that the road, though the &s;oil was a lime-&s;tone, could &s;carcely be di&s;cerned, the woods on either &s;ide forming "a clo&s;e dungeon of in|numerous boughs," that totally excluded the twilight of the &s;tars.</P>
<P>While the Confe&s;&s;or was que&s;tioning the man, with &s;ome &s;everity, a faint &s;houting was heard from a di&s;|tance, and he &s;topped the hor&s;es to li&s;ten from what quarter it came.</P>
<P>"That comes the way we are going, Signor," &s;aid the guide.</P>
<P>"Hark!" exclaimed Schedoni, "tho&s;e are &s;trains of revelry!"</P>
<P>A confu&s;ed &s;ound of voices, laughter, and mu&s;ical in&s;truments, was heard, and, as the air blew &s;tronger, tamborines and flutes were di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>"Oh! Oh! we are near the end of our journey!"
<PB N="93" REF="032735_0383_0FF4973F94B0A568">
&s;aid the pea&s;ant; "all this comes from the town we are going to. But what makes them all &s;o merry I wonder!"</P>
<P>Ellena, revived by this intelligence, followed with alacrity the &s;udden &s;peed of the Confe&s;&s;or; and pre&s;ent|ly reaching a point of the mountain, where the woods opened a clu&s;ter of lights on another &s;ummit, a little higher, more certainly announced the town.</P>
<P>They &s;oon after arrived at the ruinous gates, which had formerly led to a place of &s;ome &s;trength, and pa&s;&s;|ed at once from darkne&s;s and de&s;olated walls, into a market-place, blazing with light and re&s;ounding with the multitude. Booths, fanta&s;tically hung with lamps, and filled with merchandize of every kind, di&s;po&s;ed in the gaye&s;t order, were &s;pread on all &s;ides, and pea&s;ants in their holiday cloaths, and parties of ma&s;ks crouded every evenue. Here was a bank of mu&s;icians, and there a group of dancers; on one &s;pot the <HI>outre</HI> hu|mour of a zanni provoked the never failing laugh of an Italian rabble, in another the <HI>improvi&s;atore,</HI> by the pathos of his &s;tory, and the per&s;ua&s;ive &s;en&s;ibility of his &s;trains, was holding the attention of his auditors, as in the bands of magic. Farther on was a &s;tage rai&s;|ed for a di&s;play of fire works, and near this a theatre, where a mimic opera, the "&s;hadow of a &s;hade," was exhibiting, whence the roar of laughter, excited by the principal buffo within, mingled with the heteroge|neous voices of the venders of ice, maccaroni, &s;herbet, and diavoloni, without.</P>
<P>The Confe&s;&s;or looked upon this &s;cene with di&s;ap|pointment and ill-humour, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ade the guide go be|fore him, and &s;hew the way to the be&s;t inn; an office which the latter undertook with great glee, though he made his way with difficulty. "To think I &s;hould not know it was the time of the fair!" &s;aid he, "though to &s;ay truth, I never was at it but once in my life, &s;o it is not &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing, Signor."</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="032735_0384_0FF496F5F9A28C10">
"Make way through the crowd," &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>"After jogging on &s;o long in the dark, Signor, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> nothing at all to be &s;een," continued the man, without attending to the direction, "then to come, all of a &s;ud|den, to &s;uch a place as this, why, it is like coming out of purgatory into paradi&s;e! Well! Signor, you have forgot all your quandaries now; you think nothing now about that old ruinous place where we had &s;uch a race after the man, that would not murder us; but that &s;hot I fired did his bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>"You fired!" &s;aid Schedoni, arou&s;ed by the a&s;&s;er|tion.</P>
<P>"Yes, Signor, as I was looking over your &s;houl|der; I &s;hould have thought you mu&s;t have heard it&punc;"</P>
<P>"I &s;hould have thought &s;o, too, friend."</P>
<P>"Aye, Signor, this fine place has put all that out of your head, I warrant, as well as what I &s;aid about that &s;ame fellow; but, indeed Signor, I did not know he was related to you, when I talked &s;o of him. But, per|haps, for all that you may not know, the piece of his &s;tory I was going to tell you, when you cut me off &s;o &s;hort, though you are better acquainted with one another than I gue&s;&s;ed for; &s;o, when I come in from the fair, Signor, if you plea&s;e, I will tell it you; and it is a pretty long hi&s;tory, for I happen to know the whole of it; though, where you cut me &s;hort, when you was in one of tho&s;e quandaries, was only ju&s;t a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the beginning, but no matter for that, I can begin, it again for&mdash;"</P>
<P>"What is all this!" &s;aid Schedoni, again recalled from one of the thoughtful moods in which he had &s;o habitually indulged, that even the bu&s;tle a round him had failed to interrupt the cour&s;e of his mind. He now bade the pea&s;ant be &s;ilent; but the man was too happy to be tractable, and proceeded to expre&s;s all he felt, as they advanced &s;lowly through the crowd. Every object here was to him new and delightful;
<PB N="95" REF="032735_0385_0FF49758CF1874C8">
and, nothing doubting that it mu&s;t be equally &s;o to every other per&s;on, he was continually pointing out to the proud and gloomy Confe&s;&s;or the trivial &s;ubjects of his own admiration. "See, Signor, there is Punchinello, &s;ee! how he eats the hot maccaroni! And look there, Signor! there is a juggler! O! good Sig|nor, &s;top one minute, to look at his tricks. See! he has turned a monk into a devil already, in the twink|ling of an eye!"</P>
<P>"Silence! and proceed," &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>"That is what I &s;ay, Signor:&mdash;&s;ilence! for the people make &s;uch a noi&s;e that I cannot hear a word you &s;peak.&mdash;Silence, there!"</P>
<P>"Con&s;idering that you could not hear, you have an&s;wered, wonderfully to the purpo&s;e," &s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P>"Ah! Signora! is not this better than tho&s;e dark woods and hills? But what have we here? Look, Signor, here is a fine &s;ight!"</P>
<P>The croud which was a&s;&s;embled round a &s;tage on which &s;ome per&s;ons grote&s;quely dre&s;&s;ed, were perform|ing, now, interrupting farther progre&s;s, the travellers were compelled to &s;top at the foot of the platform. The people above were acting what &s;eemed to have been intended for a tragedy, but what their &s;trange ge&s;tures, uncouth recitation, and incongruous coun|tenances, had transformed into a comedy.</P>
<P>Schedoni thus obliged to pau&s;e, withdrew his atten|tion from the &s;cene; Ellena con&s;ented to endure it, and the pea&s;ant, with gaping mouth and &s;taring eye, &s;tood like a &s;tatue, yet not knowing whether he ought to laugh or cry, till &s;uddenly turning round to the Confe&s;&s;or, who&s;e hor&s;e was, of nece&s;&s;ity, clo&s;e to his, he &s;eized his arm, and pointing to the &s;tage, called out, "Look! Signor, &s;ee! Signor, what a &s;coundrel! what a villain! See! he has murdered his own daughter!"</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="032735_0386_0FF496FFC7B8C6B0">
At the&s;e terrible words, the indignation of Schedo|ni was done away by other emotions; he turned his eyes upon the &s;tage, and perceived that the actors were performing the &s;tory of Virginia. It was at a moment when &s;he was dying in the arms of her fa|ther, who was holding up the poignard, with which he had &s;tabbed her. The feelings of Schedoni, at this in&s;tant, inflicted a puni&s;hment almo&s;t worthy of the crime he had meditated.</P>
<P>Ellena, &s;truck with the action, and with the con|tra&s;t which it &s;eemed to offer to what &s;he had believ|to have been the late conduct of Schedoni towards her&s;elf, looked at him with mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive tender|ne&s;s, and as his glance met her's &s;he perceived, with &s;urprize, the changing emotions of his &s;oul, and the inexplicable character of his countenance. Stung to the heart, the Confe&s;&s;or furiou&s;ly &s;purred his hor&s;e that he might e&s;cape from the &s;cene, but the poor animal was too &s;piritle&s;s and jaded, to force its way through the crowd; and the pea&s;ant, vexed at being hurried from a place, where, almo&s;t for the fir&s;t time in his life, he was &s;uffering under the &s;trange de|lights of artificial grief, and, half angry, to ob&s;erve a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> animal of which he had the care, ill-treated, loudly re|mon&s;trated, and &s;eized the bridle of Schedoni, who, &s;till more incen&s;ed, was applying the whip to the &s;houlders of the guide, when the crowd &s;uddenly fell back and opened a way through which the travellers pa&s;&s;ed, and arrived, with little further interruption, at the door of the inn.</P>
<P>Schedoni was not in a humour which rendered him &s;it to encounter difficulties, and &s;till le&s;s the vulgar &s;quabbles of a place already crowded with gue&s;ts; yet it was not without much oppo&s;ition, that he at length obtained a lodging for the night. The pea|&s;ant was not le&s;s anxious for the accommodation of his hor&s;es; and when Ellena heard him declare, that

<P>SCHEDONI pa&s;&s;ed the night without &s;leep. The incident of the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ceding evening had not only renew|ed the agonies of remor&s;e, but excited tho&s;e of pride and apprehen&s;ion. There was &s;omething in the con|duct of the pea&s;ant towards him, which he could not clearly under&s;tand, though his &s;u&s;picions were &s;uffici|ent to throw his mind into a &s;tate of the utmo&s;t per|turbation. Under an air of extreme &s;implicity, this man had talked of Spalatro, had di&s;covered that he was acquainted with much of his hi&s;tory, and had hinted, that he knew by whom he had been employed; yet, at the &s;ame time, appeared uncon&s;cious, that Schedoni's was the ma&s;ter-hand, which had directed the principal ac|tions of the ruffian. At other times, his behaviour had &s;eemed to contradict the &s;uppo&s;ition of his igno|rance on this point; from &s;ome circum&s;tances he had mentioned, it appeared impo&s;&s;ible but that he mu&s;t have known who Schedoni really was, and even his own conduct had occa&s;ionally &s;eemed to acknowledge this, particularly when, being interrupted in his hi&s;tory of Spalatro, he attempted an apology, by &s;aying, he did not know it concerned Schedoni: nor could the con&s;cious Schedoni believe, that the very pointed man|ner in which the pea&s;ant had addre&s;&s;ed him at the re|pre&s;entation of Virginia, was merely accidental. He wi&s;hed to di&s;mi&s;s the man immediately, but it was fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;certain what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e knew concerning him, and then to decide on the mea&s;ures to be taken. It was, however, a difficult matter to obtain this in|formation,
<PB N="99" REF="032735_0389_0FF4975BDFE9AD80">
without manife&s;ting an anxiety, which might betray him, if the guide had, at pre&s;ent, only a general &s;u&s;picion of the truth; and no le&s;s difficult to determine how to proceed towards him, if it &s;hould be evident that his &s;u&s;picions re&s;ted on Spalatro. To take him forward to Naples, was to bring an informer to his home; to &s;uffer him to return with his di&s;co|very, now that he probably knew the place of Sche|doni's re&s;idence, was little le&s;s hazardous. His death only could &s;ecure the &s;ecret,</P>
<P>After a night pa&s;&s;ed in the tumult of &s;uch con&s;ider|ations, the Confe&s;&s;or &s;ummoned the pea&s;ant to his chamber, and, with &s;ome &s;hort preface, told him he had no further occa&s;ion for his &s;ervices, adding, care|le&s;sly, that he advi&s;ed him to be on his guard as he pa&s;&s;ed the villa, le&s;t Spalatro, who might yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">urk there, &s;hould revenge upon him the injury he had re|ceived. "According to your account of him, he is a very dangerous fellow," &s;aid Schedoni; "but your in|formation is, perhaps, erroneous."</P>
<P>The guide began, te&s;tily, to ju&s;tify him&s;elf for his a&s;&s;ertions, and the Confe&s;&s;or then endeavoured to draw from him what he knew on the &s;ubject. But, whether the man was piqued by the treatment he had lately received, or had other rea&s;ons for re&s;erve, he did not at fir&s;t appear &s;o willing to communicate as for|merly.</P>
<P>"What you hinted of this man," &s;aid Schedoni, "has, in &s;ome degree, excited curio&s;ity: I have now a few moments of lei&s;ure, and you may relate, if you will, &s;omething of the wonderful hi&s;tory you talked of."</P>
<P>"It is a long &s;tory, Signor, and you would be tired before I got to the end of it," replied the pea&s;ant; "and, craving your pardon, Signor I don't much like to be &s;napped up &s;o!"</P>
<P>"Where did this man live?" &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="032735_0390_0FF497B500CF8500">
"You mentioned &s;omething of a hou&s;e at the &s;ea &s;ide."</P>
<P>"Aye, Signor, there is a &s;trange hi&s;tory belong|ing to that hou&s;e, too; but this man, as I was &s;ay|ing, came there all of a &s;udden, nobody knew how! and the place had been &s;hut up ever &s;ince the Marche&s;e&mdash;"</P>
<P>"The Marche&s;e!" &s;aid Schedoni, coldly, "what Marche&s;e, friend?"&mdash;"Why, I mean the Barone di Cambru&s;ca, Signor, to be &s;ure, as I was going to have told you, of my own accord, if you would only have let me. Shut up ever &s;ince the Barone&mdash;I left off there, I think."</P>
<P>"I under&s;tood that the Barone was dead!" ob&s;erved the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"Yes, Signor," replied the pea&s;ant, fixing his eyes on Schedoni; "but what has his death to do with what I was telling? This happened before he died."</P>
<P>Schedoni, &s;ome what di&s;concerted by this unexpect|ed remark, forgot to re&s;ent the familiarity of it. "This man, then, this Spalatro, was Connected with the Barone di Cambru&s;ca?" &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"It was pretty well gue&s;&s;ed &s;o, Signor."</P>
<P>"How! no more than gue&s;&s;ed?"</P>
<P>"No, Signor, and that was more than enough for the Barone's liking, I warrant. He took too much care for any thing certain to appear again&s;t him, and he was wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;o to do, for if it had&mdash;it would have been wor&s;e for him. But I was going to tell you the &s;tory, Signor."</P>
<P>"What rea&s;ons were there for believing this was an agent of the Barone di Cambru&s;ca, friend?"</P>
<P>"I thought you wi&s;hed to hear the &s;tory, Signor."</P>
<P>"In good time; but fir&s;t, what were your rea&s;ons?"</P>
<P>"One of them is enough, Signor, and if you would only have let me gone &s;traight on with the &s;to|ry,
<PB N="100" REF="032735_0391_0FF498BF31964A48">
you would have found it out by this time, Signor."</P>
<P>Schedoni frowned, but did not otherwi&s;e reprove the impertinence of the &s;peech.</P>
<P>"It was rea&s;on enough, Signor, to my mind," continued the pea&s;ant, "that it was &s;uch a crime as no|body but the Barone di Cambru&s;ca could have com|mitted; there was nobody wicked enough, in our parts, to have done it but him. Why is not this <HI>rea|&s;on</HI> enough, Signor? What makes you look at me &s;o, why the Barone him&s;elf could hardly have looked wor&s;e, if I had told him as much!"</P>
<P>"Be le&s;s prolix," &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or, in a re&s;train|ed voice.</P>
<P>"Well then, Signor, to begin at the beginning. It is a good many years ago, that Marco came fir&s;t to our town. Now the &s;tory goes, that one &s;tormy night&mdash;"</P>
<P>"You may &s;pare your&s;elf the trouble of relating the &s;tory," &s;aid Schedoni, abruptly, "Did you ever &s;ee the Barone you was &s;peaking of friend?"</P>
<P>"Why did you bid me tell it, Signor, &s;ince you know it already! I have been here all this while, ju&s;t a-going to begin it, and all for nothing!"</P>
<P>"It is very &s;urpri&s;ing," re&s;umed the artful Schedo|ni, without having noticed what had been &s;aid, "that if this Spalatro was known to be the villian you &s;ay he is, not any &s;tep &s;hould have been taken to bring him to ju&s;tice! now happened that? But, perhaps, all this &s;tory was nothing more than a report."</P>
<P>"Why, Signor, it was every body's bu&s;ine&s;s, and nobody's as one may &s;ay; then, be&s;ides, nobody could prove what they had heard, and, though every body believed the &s;tory ju&s;t the &s;ame as if they had &s;een the whole, yet that, they &s;aid, would not do in law, but they &s;hould be made to prove it. Now, it is not one time in ten that any thing can be proved, Signor, as you well know, yet we none of us believe it the le&s;s for that!"</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="032735_0392_0FF497BFA56136C0">
"So then, you would have had this man puni&s;hed for a murder, which, probably, he never commit|ted!" &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"A murder!" repeated the pea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Schedoni was &s;ilent, but, in the next in&s;tant, &s;aid "Did you not &s;ay it was a murder?"</P>
<P>"I have not told you &s;o, Signor!"</P>
<P>"What was the crime, then?" re&s;umed Schedoni, after another momentary pau&s;e, "you &s;aid it was attro|cious, and what more &s;o than&mdash;murder?" His lip qui|vered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ronounced the la&s;t word.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> made no reply, but remained with his eyes fixed upon the Confe&s;&s;or, and, at length repeated, "Did I &s;ay it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> murder, Signor?</P>
<P>"If it was not that, &s;ay what it was," demanded the Confe&s;&s;or, haughtily; but let it be in two words."</P>
<P>"As if a Story could be told in two words Signor!</P>
<P>"Well, well, be breif."</P>
<P>"How can I Signor, when the &s;tory is &s;o long!"</P>
<P>"I will wa&s;te no more time," &s;aid Schedoni, going.</P>
<P>"Well, Signor, I will do my be&s;t to make it &s;hort. It was one &s;tormy night in December, that Marco Torma had been out fi&s;hing. Marco, Signor, was an old man that lived in our town when I was a boy; I can but ju&s;t remember him, but my father knew him well and loved old Marco, and u&s;ed often to &s;ay&mdash;"</P>
<P>"To the &s;tory!" &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>"Why I am telling it, Signor, as fa&s;t as I can. This old Marco did not live in our town at the time it happened, but in &s;ome place, I have forgot the name of it, near the &s;ea &s;hore. What can the name be! it is &s;omething like&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Well, what happened to this old dotard?"</P>
<P>"You are out there, Signor, he was no old dotard; but you &s;hall hear. At that time, Signor, Marco li|ved in this place that I have forgot the name of, and was a fi&s;herman, but better times turned up after af|terwards,
<PB N="103" REF="032735_0393_0FF4975E5B0C5100">
but that is neither here nor there. Old Mar|co had been out fi&s;hing; it was a &s;tormy night and he was glad to get on &s;hore, I warrant. It was quite dark, as dark Signor, as it was la&s;t night, and he was ma|king the be&s;t of his way, Signor, with &s;ome fi&s;h along the &s;hore, but it being &s;o dark, he lo&s;t it notwith&s;tan|ding. The rain beat, and the wind blew, and he wan|dered about a long while, and could &s;ee no light, nor hear any thing, but the &s;urge near him, which &s;ome|times &s;eemed as if it was coming to wa&s;h him away. He got as far off as he could, but he knew there were high rocks over the beach, and he was afraid he &s;hould run his head again&s;t them, if he went too far, I &s;up|po&s;e. However at la&s;t, he went up clo&s;e to them, and as he got a little &s;helter, he re&s;olved to try no further for the pre&s;ent. I tell it you, Signor, ju&s;t as my father told it me, and he had it from the old man him&s;elf."</P>
<P>"You need not be &s;o particular," replied the Con|fe&s;&s;or: "&s;peak to the point."</P>
<P>"Well, Signor, as old Marco lay &s;nug under the rocks, he thought he heard &s;omebody coming, and he lifted up his head, I warrant, poor old &s;oul! as if he could have &s;een who it was; however he could hear, though it was &s;o dark, and he heard the &s;teps coming on; but he &s;aid nothing yet, meaning to let them come clo&s;e up to him, before he di&s;covered him&s;elf. Pre&s;ently he &s;ees a little moving light, and it comes nearer and nearer, till it was ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to him, and then he &s;aw the &s;hadow of a man on the ground, and then &s;pied the man him&s;elf, with a dark lanthorn, pa&s;&s;ing along the beach."</P>
<P>"Well well, to the purpo&s;e," &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>"Old Marco, Signor, my father &s;ays, was never &s;tout hearted, and he took it into his head this might be a robber, becau&s;e he had the lanthorn, though, for that matter, he would have been glad enough of a lanthorn him&s;elf, and &s;o he lay quiet. But, pre&s;ently
<PB N="104" REF="032735_0394_0FF497C12D84A620">
he was in a rare fright, for the man &s;topped to re&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> load he had upon his back, on a piece of a rock <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him, and old Marco &s;aw him throw off a heavy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and heard him breathe hard, as if he was hugely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. I tell it, Signor, ju&s;t as my father does.</P>
<P>"What was in the &s;ack?" &s;aid Schedoni, coolly.</P>
<P>"All in good time, Signor;" perhaps old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> never found out; but you &s;hall hear. He was afraid, when he &s;aw the &s;ack, to &s;tir a limb, for he thought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> held booty. But, pre&s;ently, the man, without &s;aying a word, heaved it on his &s;houlders again, and &s;tagger|ed away with it along the beach, and Marco &s;aw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> more of him."</P>
<P>"Well! what has he to do with your &s;tory, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;" &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or, "Was this Spalatro?"</P>

<P>"Well! this hi&s;tory never will have and end?" &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>"Well! Signor, he had not gone far when he found out that it was no lanthorn, but a light at a win|dow. When he came up to the hou&s;e he knocked &s;oftly at the door, but nobody came."</P>
<P>"What hou&s;e?" inquired the Confe&s;&s;or, &s;harply.
<PB N="105" REF="032735_0395_0FF49768E779BE50">
"The rain beat hard, Signor, and I warrant poor old Marco waited a long time before he knocked again, for he was main patient, Signor O! how I have &s;een him li&s;ten to a &s;tory, let it be ever &s;o long!"</P>
<P>"I have need of his patience!" &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>"When he knocked again, Signor, the door gave way a little, and he found it was open, and &s;o, as no|body came, he thought fit to walk in of his own ac|cord"</P>
<P>"The dotard! what bu&s;ine&s;s had he to be &s;o curi|ous?" exclaimed Schedoni.</P>
<P>"Curious! Signor, he only &s;ought &s;helter! He &s;tumbled about in the dark, for a good while, and could find nobody, nor make nobody hear, but at la&s;t, he came to a room where there was &s;ome fire not quite out, upon the hearth, and he went up to it, to warm him&s;elf, till &s;omebody &s;hould come."</P>
<P>"What! was there nobody in the hou&s;e?" &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>"You &s;hall hear, Signor. He had not been there, he &s;aid, no, he was &s;ure, not above two minutes, when he heard a &s;trange &s;ort of a noi&s;e in the very room where he was, but the fire gave &s;uch a poor light, he could not &s;ee whether any body was there."</P>
<P>"What was the noi&s;e?"</P>
<P>"You put me out, Signor. He &s;aid he did not much like it, but what could he do! So he &s;tirred up the fire, and tried to make it blaze a little, but it was as du&s;ky as ever; he could &s;ee nothing. Pre&s;ently, however, he heard &s;omebody coming and &s;aw a light and then a man coming towards the room where he was, &s;o he went up to him to a&s;k &s;helter."</P>
<P>"Who was this man?" &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>"A&s;k &s;helter. He, &s;ays the man, when he came to the door of the room, turned as white as a &s;heet, as well he might, to &s;ee a &s;tranger, to find a &s;tranger there, at that time of the night. I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould have done the &s;ame my&s;elf. The man did not &s;eem very will|ing

<P>"Yes, he appears to have had a great deal, indeed! &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or, and turning away, renewed his pace.</P>

<P><PB N="108" REF="032735_0398_0FF497C43B414020">
Schedoni again checked his &s;teps, and &s;tood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> before the pea&s;ant.</P>
<P>"He rai&s;ed it, however, a little, Signor, but it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from his hands, and with &s;uch a heavy weight upon the floor, that he was &s;ure it held no common booty. Ju&s;t then, he &s;ays, he thought he heard Spalatro coming, and the &s;ound of the &s;ack was enough to have frighten|ed him, and &s;o Marco quitted it; but he was mi&s;ta|ken, and he went to it again. But you don't &s;eem to hear me, Signor, for you look as you do when you are are in tho&s;e quandaries, &s;o bu&s;y a thinking, and I&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Proceed," &s;aid Schedoni, &s;ternly, and renewed his &s;teps, "I hear you."</P>
<P>"Went to it again,"&mdash;re&s;umed the pea&s;ant, cauti|ou&s;ly taking up the &s;tory at the la&s;t words he had drop|ped. "He untied the &s;tring Signor, that held the &s;ack, and opened the cloth a little way, but think, Sig|nor, what he mu&s;t have thought when he felt&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fle&s;h!

<P>The pea&s;ant, in the eagerne&s;s with which he relat|ed this circum&s;tance, had followed Schedoni to the o|ther end of the chamber, and he now took hold of his garment, as if to &s;ecure his attention to the remainder of the &s;tory. The Confe&s;&s;or, however, continued his &s;teps, and the pea&s;ant kept pace with him, &s;till loo&s;ely holding his garment.</P>
<P>"Marco," he re&s;umed, "was &s;o terrified, as my fa|ther &s;ays, that he hardly knew where he was, and I warrant, if one could have &s;een him, he looked a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> white, Signor as you do now."</P>
<P>The Confe&s;&s;or abruptly withdrew his garment from the pea&s;ant's gra&s;p, and &s;aid, in an inward voice, "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I am &s;hocked at the mere mention of &s;uch a &s;pectacle no wonder he was, who beheld it!"

again, Signor, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> when he came to his thoughts, his only fear was, le&s;t Spalatro &s;hould return, though he had hardly been gone a minute, before he could get out of the hou&s;e, for he cared nothing about the &s;torm now. And &s;ure enough he heard him coming, but he manag|ed to get out of the room, into a pa&s;&s;age another way from that Spalatro was in. And luckily, too it was the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age he had come in by, and it led him out of the hou&s;e. He made no more ado, but ran &s;traight off, without &s;toping to chu&s;e which way, and many per|ils and dangers he got into among the woods, that night, and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"How happened it, that this Spalatro was not taken up, after this di&s;covery?" &s;aid Schedoni. "What was the con&s;equence of it?&punc;</P>
<P>"Why Signor, old Marco had like to have caught his death that night; what with wet, and what with fright, he was laid up with a fever, and was light-head|ed, and raved of &s;uch &s;trange things, that people would not believe any thing he &s;aid when he came to his &s;en&s;es,"</P>
<P>"Aye, &s;aid Schedoni, the narrative re&s;embles a de|lerious dream, more than a reality; I perfectly accord with them in their opinion of this feveri&s;h old man."</P>
<P>"But you &s;hall hear, Signor; after a while they be|gan to think better of it, and there was &s;ome &s;tir made about it; but what could poor folks do, for nothing could be proved! The hou&s;e was &s;earched, but the man was gone, and nothing could be found! From that time the place was &s;hut up; till many years after, this Spalatro appeared, and old Marco then &s;aid he was pretty &s;ure he was the man, but he could not &s;wear it, and &s;o nothing could be done."</P>
<P>"Then it appears, after all, that you are not certain that this long hi&s;tory belongs to this Spalatro!" &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or; "nay not even that the hi&s;tory it&s;elf is any thing more than the vi&s;ion of a di&s;tempered brain!"</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="032735_0400_0FF497CDAC033A28">
"I do not konw Signor, what you may call cert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">in; but I know what we all believe. But the &s;trange&s;t part of the &s;tory is to come yet, and that which nobo|dy would believe, hardly if&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I have heard enough," &s;aid Schedoni, "I will hear no more!"</P>
<P>"Well but, Signor, I have not told you half yet; and I am &s;ure when I heard it my&s;elf, it &s;o terrified me.</P>
<P>"I have li&s;tened too long to this idle hi&s;tory," &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or, "there &s;eems to be no rational found|ation for it. Here is what I owe you; you may de|part."</P>
<P>"Well, but, Signor, 'tis plain you know the re&s;t already, or you never would go without it. But you don't know perhaps, Signor what an unaccountable&mdash;I am &s;ure it made my hair &s;tand on end to hear of it what an unaccountable&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I will hear no more of this ab&s;urdity," interrupt|ed Schedoni, with &s;ternne&s;s. "I reproach my&s;elf for having li&s;tened &s;o long to &s;uch a go&s;&s;ip's tale, and have no further curio&s;ity concerning it. You may with|draw; and bid the ho&s;t attend me."</P>
<P>"Well, Signor, if you are &s;o ea&s;ily &s;atisfied," re|plied the pea&s;ant, with di&s;appointment, "there is no more to be &s;aid, but&mdash;"</P>
<P>"You may &s;tay, however, while I caution you," &s;aid Schedoni, "how you pa&s;s the villa, where this Spalatro may yet linger, for, though I can only &s;mile at the &s;tory you have related&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Related, Signor! why I have not told it half; and if you &s;hould only plea&s;e to be patient&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Though I can only &s;mile at that &s;imple narra|tive,"&mdash;repeated Schedoni in a louder tone.</P>
<P>"Nay, Signor, for that matter, you can frown at it too, as I can te&s;tify," muttered the guide.</P>
<P>"Li&s;ten to me!" &s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or, in a yet more in&s;i&s;ting voice. "I &s;ay, that though I give no credit
<PB N="111" REF="032735_0401_0FF4976D79DAAF28">
to your curious hi&s;tory, I think this &s;ame Spalatro appears to be a de&s;perate fellow, and therefore, I would have you be on your guard. If you &s;ee him, you may depend upon it, that he will attempt your life in re|venge of the injury I have done him. I give you, there|fore, in addition to your trombone, this &s;tiletto to defend you."</P>
<P>Schedoni, while he &s;poke, took an in&s;trument from his bo&s;om, but it was not the one he u&s;ually wore, or, at lea&s;t, that he was &s;een to wear. He delivered it to the pea&s;ant, who received it with a kind of &s;tupid &s;ur|pri&s;e, and then gave him &s;ome directions as to the way in which it &s;hould be managed.</P>
<P>"Why, Signor," &s;aid the man, who had li&s;tened with much attention, "I am kindly obliged to you for thinking about me, but is there any thing in this &s;tiletto different from others, that it is to be u&s;ed &s;o?"</P>
<P>Schedoni looked gravely on the pea&s;ant for an in|&s;tant, and then replied, "Certainly not, friend, I would only in&s;truct you to u&s;e it to the be&s;t advantage; fare|well!"</P>
<P>"Thank you kindly, Signor, but&mdash;but I think I have no need of it, my trombone is enough for me."</P>
<P>"This will defend you more adroitly," replied Schedoni, refu&s;ing to take back the &s;tiletto, "and moreover, while you were loading the trombone, your adver&s;ary might u&s;e his poignard to advantage. Keep it, therefore, friend; it will protect you better than a dozen trombones. Put it up."</P>
<P>Perhaps it was Schedoni's particular look, more than his argument, that convinced the guide of the value of his gift; he received it &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively, though with a &s;tare of &s;tupid &s;urpri&s;e; probable it had been better if it had been &s;u&s;picious &s;urpri&s;e. He thanked Schedoni again, and was leaving the room, when the Confe&s;&s;or called out, "Send the landlord to me imme|diately,
<PB N="112" REF="032735_0402_0FF497CF334B7840">
I &s;hall &s;et off for Rome without delay!"</P>
<P>"Yes, Signor," replied the pea&s;ant, "you are at the right place, the road parts here; but I thought you was going for Naples!"</P>
<P>"For Rome," &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>"For Rome, Signor! Well, I hope you will get &s;afe, Signor, with all my heart!" &s;aid the guide, and quitted the chamber.</P>
<P>While this dialogue had been pa&s;&s;ing between Schedoni and the pea&s;ant, Ellena, in &s;olitude, was con|&s;idering on the means of prevailing with the Confe&s;&s;or to allow her to return either to Altieri, or to the neigh|bouring cloi&s;ter of "<HI>Our Lady of Pity,</HI>" in&s;tead of placing her at a di&s;tance from Naples, till he &s;hould think proper to acknowledge her. The plan, which he had mentioned, &s;eemed to her long-harra&s;&s;ed mind to exile her for ever from happine&s;s, and all that was dear to her affections; it appeared like a &s;econd ban|i&s;hment to San Stefano, and every abbe&s;s, except that of the <HI>Santa della Pieta,</HI> came to her imagination in the portraiture of an inexorable jailor. While this &s;ub|ject engaged her, &s;he was &s;ummoned to attend Schedo|ni, whom &s;he found impatient to enter the carriage, which at this town they had been able to procure. El|lena, on looking out for the guide, was informed that he had already &s;et off for his home, a circum&s;tance, for the &s;uddenne&s;s of which &s;he knew not how to account.</P>
<P>The travellers immediately proceeded on their jour|ney; Schedoni, reflecting on the late conver&s;ation, &s;aid little, and Ellena read not in his countenance any thing that might encourage her to introduce the &s;ubject of her own intended &s;olicitation. Thus &s;eparately occu|pied, they advanced, during &s;ome hours, on the road to Naples, for thither Schedoni had de&s;igned to go, not|with&s;tanding his late a&s;&s;ertion to the guide, whom it appears, for whatever rea&s;on, he was anxious to deceive, as to the place of his actual re&s;idence.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="032735_0403_0FF49777DA805128">
They &s;topped to dine at a town of &s;ome con&s;iderati|on, and, when Ellena heard the Confe&s;&s;or enquire con|cerning the numerous convents it contained, &s;he per|ceived that it was nece&s;&s;ary for her no longer to defer her petition. She therefore repre&s;ented immediately what mu&s;t be the forlornne&s;s of her &s;tate, and the anx|iety of her mind, if &s;he were placed at a di&s;tance from the &s;cenes and the people, which affection and early ha|bit &s;eemed to have con&s;ecrated; e&s;pecially at this time, when her &s;pirits had &s;carcely recovered from the &s;evere pre&s;&s;ure of long &s;uffering, and when to &s;ooth and ren|ovate them, not only quiet, but the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;e|curity, were nece&s;&s;ary; a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s which it was impo&s;&s;ible, and e&s;pecially &s;o after her late experience, that &s;he could acquire among &s;trangers till they &s;hould cea&s;e to be &s;uch.</P>
<P>To the&s;e pleadings Schedoni thoughtfully attended, but the darkne&s;s of his a&s;pect did not indicate that his compa&s;&s;ion was touched; and Ellena proceeded to re|pre&s;ent, &s;econdly, that, which, had &s;he been more art|ful, or le&s;s di&s;dainful of cunning, &s;he would have urged the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>As it was, &s;he had begun with the mention of cir|cum&s;tances, which, though the lea&s;t likely to prevail with Schedoni, &s;he felt to be mo&s;t important to her|&s;elf, and &s;he concluded with repre&s;enting that, which was mo&s;t intere&s;ting to him. Ellena &s;ugge&s;ted, that her re&s;idence in the neighborhood of Altieri might be &s;o managed, as that his &s;ecret would be as effectually pre&s;erved, as if &s;he were an hundred miles from Naples.</P>
<P>It may appear extraordinary, that a man of Schedo|ni's habitual coolne&s;s, and exact calculation, &s;hould have &s;uffered fear, on this occa&s;ion, to ob&s;cure his per|ceptions, and this in&s;tance &s;trongly proved the magni|tude of the cau&s;e, which could produce &s;o powerful an effect. While he now li&s;tened to Ellena, he began to perceive circum&s;tances that had eluded his own ob&s;er|vation;
<PB N="114" REF="032735_0404_0FF497D0B98DDB30">
and he, at length, acknowledged, that it might be &s;afer to permit her to return to the Villa Altieri, and that &s;he &s;hould from thence go, as &s;he had former|ly intended, to the <HI>Santa della Pieta,</HI> than to place her in any convent, however remote, where it would be nece&s;&s;ary for him&s;elf to introduce her. His only re|maining objection to the neighborhood of Naples, now re&s;ted on the chance it would offer the Marche&s;a di Vivaldi of di&s;covering Ellena's abode, before he &s;hould judge it convenient to di&s;clo&s;e to her his family; and his knowledge of the Marche&s;a ju&s;tified his mo&s;t hor|rible &s;u&s;picion, as to the con&s;equence of &s;uch a pre|mature di&s;covery,</P>
<P>Something, however, it appeared, mu&s;t be ri&s;ked in any &s;ituation he might choo&s;e for Ellena; and her re&s;idence at the <HI>Santa della Pieta,</HI> a large convent, well &s;ecured, and where, as &s;he had been known to them from her infancy, the abbe&s;s and the &s;i&s;ters might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be not indifferent concerning her welfare, &s;eemed to promi&s;e &s;ecurity again&s;t any actual violence from the malice of the Marche&s;a; again&s;t her artful du|plicity every place would be almo&s;t equally in&s;uffici|ent. Here, as Ellena would appear in the character &s;he had always been known in, no curio&s;ity could be excited, or &s;u&s;picion awakened, as to her family; and here therefore Schedoni's &s;ecret would more probably be pre&s;erved, than el&s;ewhere. As this was, after all, the predominant &s;ubject of his anxiety, to which, how|ever unnatural it may &s;eem, even the &s;afety of Ellena was &s;econdary, he finally determined, that &s;he &s;hould return to the <HI>Santa della Pieta;</HI> and &s;he thanked him almo&s;t with tears, for a con&s;ent which &s;he received as a generous indulgence, but which was in reality little more than an effect of &s;elfi&s;h apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>The remainder of the journey, which was of &s;ome days, pa&s;&s;ed without any remarkable occurrence: Sche|doni, with only &s;hort intervals, was &s;till enveloped in
<PB N="115" REF="032735_0405_0FF49779619F3D20">
gloom and &s;ilence; and Ellena, with thoughts engaged by the one &s;ubject of her intere&s;t, the pre&s;ent &s;ituation and circum&s;tances of Vivaldi, willingly &s;ubmitted to this prolonged &s;tillne&s;s.</P>
<P>As, at length, &s;he drew near Naples, her emotions be|came more various and powerful; and, when &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the top of Ve&s;uvius peeping over every intervening &s;ummit, &s;he wept as her imagination cha|ractered all the well-known country it overlooked. But when, having reached an eminence, that &s;cenery was exhibited to her &s;en&s;es, when the Bay of Naples, &s;tretching into remote&s;t di&s;tance, was &s;pread out be|fore her; when every mountain of that magnificent horizon, which inclo&s;ed her native land&s;cape, that country which &s;he believed Vivaldi to inhabit, &s;tood unfolded, how affecting, how overwhelming were her &s;en&s;ations! Every object &s;eemed to &s;peak of her home, of Vivaldi, and of happine&s;s that was pa&s;&s;ed! and &s;o exqui&s;itely did regret mingle with hope, the tender grief of remembrance with the intere&s;t of ex|pectation, that it were difficult to &s;ay which pre|vailed.</P>
<P>Her expre&s;&s;ive countenance di&s;clo&s;ed to the Con|fe&s;&s;or the cour&s;e of her thoughts and of her feelings, feelings which, while he contemned, he believed he perfectly comprehended, but of which, having never in any degree experienced them, he really under&s;tood nothing. The callous Schedoni, by a mi&s;take not uncommon, e&s;pecially to a mind of his character, &s;ub|&s;tituted words for truths; not only confounding the limits of nighbouring qualities, but mi&s;taking their very principles. Incapable of perceiving their nice di&s;tinctions, he called the per&s;ons who &s;aw them, mere|ly fanciful; thus making his very incapacity an argu|ment for his &s;uperior wi&s;dom. And, while he con|founded delicacy of feeling with &s;atiety of the mind, ta&s;te with caprice, and imagination with error, he
<PB N="116" REF="032735_0406_0FF497D24376F680">
yielded, when he mo&s;t congratulated him&s;elf on hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;agacity, to illu&s;ions, no le&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, becau&s;e they were le&s;s brilliant, than tho&s;e which are incident to &s;entiment and feeling.</P>
<P>The better to e&s;cape ob&s;ervation, Schedoni ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> contrived not to reach Naples till the clo&s;e of the even|ing, and it was entirely dark before the carriage &s;top|ped at the villa Altieri. Ellena with a mixture of melancholy and &s;atisfaction, viewed, once more, her long de&s;erted home, and while &s;he waited till a &s;ervant &s;hould open the gate, remembered how often &s;he had thus waited when there was a beloved friend within, to welcome her with &s;miles, which were now gone for ever. Beatrice, the old hou&s;ekeeper, at length, however, appeared, and received her with an affection as &s;incere, if not as &s;trong, as that of the relative for whom &s;he mourned.</P>
<P>Here Schedoni alighted, and, having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the carriage, entered the hou&s;e for the purpo&s;e of relin|qui&s;hing al&s;o his di&s;gui&s;e, and re&s;uming his monk's habit. Before he departed, Ellena ventured to men|tion Vivaldi, and to expre&s;s her wi&s;h to hear of his exact &s;ituation; but, though Schedoni was too well enabled to inform her of it, policy which had hitherto kept him &s;ilent on this &s;ubject &s;till influenced him; and he re|plied only, that if he &s;hould happen to learn the cir|cum&s;tances of his condition, &s;he &s;hould not remain ig|norant of them.</P>
<P>This a&s;&s;urance revived Ellena, for two rea&s;ons; it afforded her a hope of relief from her pre&s;ent un|certainty, and it al&s;o &s;eemed to expre&s;s an approbation of the object of her affection, &s;uch as the Confe&s;&s;or never had yet di&s;clo&s;ed. Schedoni added, that he &s;hould &s;ee her no more, till he thought proper to ac|knowledge her for his daughter; but that, if circum|&s;tances made it nece&s;&s;ary, he &s;hould, in the mean time, write to her; and he now gave her a direction by
<PB N="117" REF="032735_0407_0FF4977AE7962BA8">
which to addre&s;s him under a fictitious name, and at a place remote from his convent. Ellena, though a&s;&s;ur|ed of the nece&s;&s;ity for this conduct, could not yield to &s;uch di&s;gui&s;e, without an aver&s;ion that was &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed in her manner, but of which Schedoni took no notice. He bade her, as &s;he valued her exi&s;tence, watchfully to pre&s;erve the &s;ecret of her birth; and to wa&s;te not a &s;ingle day at Villa Altieri, but to retire to the <HI>Santa della Pieta;</HI> and the&s;e injunctions were delivered in a manner &s;o &s;olemn &amp; energetic, as not only deeply to impre&s;s upon her mind the nece&s;&s;ity of fulfil|ing them, but to excite &s;ome degree of amazement.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort and general direction re&s;pecting her further conduct, Schedoni bade her farewell, and, privately quitting the villa, in his eccle&s;ia&s;tical dre&s;s, repaired to the dominican convent, which he entered as a brother returned from a di&s;tant pilgrimage. He was received as u&s;ual, by the &s;ociety, and found him|&s;elf, once more, the au&s;tere father Schedoni of the Spi|rito Sancto.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of his fir&s;t anxiety was the nece&s;&s;ity for ju&s;tifying him&s;elf to the Marche&s;a di Vivaldi, for a&s;|certaining how much he might venture to reveal of the truth, and for e&s;timating what would be her de|ci&s;ion, were &s;he informed of the whole. His &s;econd &s;tep would be to obtain the relea&s;e of Vivaldi; and, as his conduct in this in&s;tance would be regulated, in a great degree, by the re&s;ult of his conference with the Marche&s;a, it would be only the &s;econd. However painful it mu&s;t be to Schedoni to meet her, now that he had di&s;covered the depth of the guilt, in which &s;he would have involved him, he determined to &s;eek this eventful conference on the following morning: and he pa&s;&s;ed this night partly in unea&s;y expectation of the approaching day, but chiefly in inventing circum|&s;tances, and arranging arguments, that might bear him triumphantly towards the accompli&s;hment of his grand de&s;ign.</P>

<P>SCHEDONI, on his way to the Vivaldi pala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, again reviewed and arranged every argument, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rather &s;pecious circum&s;tance, which might induce the Marche&s;a's con&s;ent to the nuptials he &s;o much de&s;ired. His family was noble, though no longer wealthy, and he believed that as the &s;eeming want of de&s;cent had hitherto been the chief objection to Ellena, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Marche&s;a might be prevailed with to overlook <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> wreck of his fortune.</P>
<P>At the palace he was told, the Marche&s;a was at one of her villas on the bay; and he was too anxious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to follow her thither immediately. This delightful re&s;idence was &s;ituated on an airy promontory, that overhung the water, and was nearly embo&s;omed a|mong the woods, that &s;pread far along the heights, and de&s;cended with great pomp of foliage and colouring, to the very margin of the waves.

<P>The &s;ervants had orders to admit father Schedoni
<PB N="119" REF="032735_0409_0FF4977C6DADCD48">
at all times, and he was &s;hewn into a &s;aloon in which the Marche&s;a was alone. Every object in this apart|ment announced ta&s;te, and even magnificence. The hangings were of purple and gold; the vaulted cieling was de&s;igned by one of the fir&s;t painters of the Vene|cian &s;chool; the marble &s;tatues that adorned the re|ce&s;&s;es were not le&s;s exqui&s;ite, and the whole &s;ymmetry and architecture airy, yet rich; gay, yet cha&s;tened; re&s;embled the palace of a fairy, and &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s almo&s;t equal fa&s;cinations. The lattices were thrown open, to admit the pro&s;pect, as well as the air loaded with fragrance from an orangery that &s;pread before them. Lofty palms and plantains threw their green and refre&s;hing tint over the windows, and on the lawn that &s;loped to the edge of the precipice, a &s;hadowy per&s;pective, beyond which appeared the am|ple waters of the gulf, where the light &s;ails of feluccas, and the &s;preading canva&s;s of larger ve&s;&s;els, glided up|on the &s;cene and pa&s;&s;ed away, as in a camera ob&s;cura. Ve&s;uvius and the city of Naples were &s;een on the coa&s;t beyond, with many a bay and lofty cape of that long tract of bold and gaily-coloured &s;cenery, which extends towards Cape Campanella, crowned by fading ranges of mountains, lighted up with all the magic of Italian &s;un&s;hine. The Marche&s;a reclined on a &s;ofa before an open lattice; her eyes were fixed upon the pro&s;pect without, but her attention was wholly occupied by the vi&s;ions that evil pa&s;&s;ions painted to her imagina|tion. On her &s;till beautiful features was the languor of di&s;content and indi&s;po&s;ition; and, though her man|ners, like her dre&s;s, di&s;played the elegant negligence of the graces, they concealed the movements of a care|ful, and even a tortured heart. On perceiving Sche|doni, a faint &s;mile lightened upon her countenance, and &s;he held forth her hand to him; at the touch of which he &s;huddered.</P>
<P>"My good father, I rejoice to &s;ee you," &s;aid the

Marche&s;a; "I have felt the want of your conver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|tion much, and at this moment of indi&s;po&s;ition e&s;pe|cially."</P>
<P>She waved the attendant to withdraw; while Sche|doni, &s;talking to a window, could with difficulty con|ceal the perturbation with which he now, for the fir&s;t time, con&s;ciou&s;ly beheld the willing de&s;troyer of his child. Some farther compliment from the Marche&s;a recalled him; he &s;oon recovered all his addre&s;s, and approaching her, &s;aid.</P>
<P>"Daughter! you always &s;end me away a wor&s;e Dominican than I come; I approach you with humili|ty, but depart elated with pride, and am obliged to &s;uf|fer much from &s;elf-infliction before I can de&s;cend to my proper level."</P>
<P>After &s;ome other flatteries had been exchanged, a &s;ilence of &s;everal moments followed, during which neither of the parties &s;eemed to have &s;ufficient cou|rage to introduce the &s;ubjects that engaged their thoughts, &s;ubjects upon which their intere&s;ts were now &s;o directly and unexpectedly oppo&s;ite. Had Schedoni been le&s;s occupied by his own feelings, he might have perceived the extreme agitation of the Marche&s;a, the tremor of her nerves, the faint flu&s;h that cro&s;&s;ed her che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k, wanne&s;s that &s;ucceeded, the languid movement of her eyes, and the laborious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">igh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that interrupted her breathing, while &s;he wi&s;hed, yet dared not a&s;k, whether Ellena was no more and avert|ed her regards from him, whom &s;he almo&s;t believed to be a murderer.</P>
<P>Schedoni, not le&s;s affected, though apparently tran|quil, as &s;edulou&s;ly avoided the face of the Marche&s;a, whom he con&s;idered with a degree of contempt almo&s;t equal to his in dignotion: his feelings had rever&s;ed, for the pre&s;ent, all his opinions on the &s;ubject of their former arguments, and had taught him, for once, to think ju&s;tly. Every moment of &s;ilence now
<PB N="121" REF="032735_0411_0FF49786725ED620">
encrea&s;ed his embarra&s;&s;ment, and his reluctance even to name Ellena. He feared to tell that &s;he lived, yet de&s;pi&s;ed him&s;elf for &s;uffering &s;uch fear, and &s;huddered at a recollection of the conduct, which had made any a&s;&s;urance concerning her life nece&s;&s;ary. The in&s;inu|ation, that he had di&s;covered her family to be &s;uch as would not degrade that of the Marche&s;a, he knew not how to introduce with &s;uch delicacy of gradation as might win upon the jealou&s;y of her pride, and &s;oothe her di&s;appointment; and he was &s;till meditating how he might lead to this &s;ubject, when the Marche&s;a her|&s;elf broke the &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"Father," &s;he &s;aid, with a &s;igh, "I always look to you for con&s;olation, and am &s;eldom di&s;appointed. You are too well acquainted with the anxiety which has long oppre&s;&s;ed me; may I under&s;tand that the cau&s;e of it is removed?" She pau&s;ed, and then added, "May I hope that my &s;on will no longer be led from the ob|&s;ervance of his duty?"</P>
<P>Schedoni, with his eyes fixed on the ground, re|mained &s;ilent, but, at length, &s;aid, "the chief occa&s;ion of your anxiety is certainly removed,"&mdash;and he was again &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"How!" exclaimed the Marche&s;a, with the quick|fightedne&s;s of &s;u&s;picion, while all her di&s;&s;imulation yielded to the urgency of her fear, "Have you &s;ailed? Is &s;he not dead?"</P>
<P>In the earne&s;tne&s;s of the que&s;tion, &s;he fixed her eyes on Schedoni's face and perceiving there &s;ymptoms of extraordinary emotion, added, "Relieve me from my apprehen&s;ions, good father, I entreat; tell me that you have &s;ucceeded, and that &s;he has paid the debt of ju&s;tice."</P>
<P>Schedoni rai&s;ed his eyes to the Marche&s;a, but in|&s;tantly averted them; indignation had lifted them, and di&s;gu&s;t and &s;tifled horror turned them away. Though very little of the&s;e feelings appeared, the Marche&s;a
<PB N="122" REF="032735_0412_0FF497DFCC0C51F0">
perceived &s;uch expre&s;&s;ion as &s;he had never been ac|cu&s;tomed to ob&s;erve in his countenance; and, her &s;ur|pri&s;e and impatience encrea&s;ing, &s;he once more repeat|ed the que&s;tion, and with a yet more deci&s;ive air than before.</P>
<P>"I have not failed in the grand object," replied Schedoni: "your &s;on is no longer in danger of form|ing a di&s;graceful alliance."</P>
<P>"In what, then, have you failed?" a&s;ked the Mar|che&s;a; for I perceive that you have not been complete|ly &s;ucce&s;sful."</P>
<P>"I ought not to &s;ay that I have failed in any re&s;|pect," replied Schedoni, with emotion, "&s;ince the honor of your hou&s;e is pre&s;erved, and&mdash;a life is &s;pared."</P>
<P>His voice faultered as he pronounced the la&s;t words, and he &s;eemed to experience again the horror of that moment, when, with an uplifted poignard in his gra&s;p, he had di&s;covered Ellena for his daughter.</P>
<P>"Spared!" repeated the Marche&s;a, doubtingly; explain your&s;elf, good father!"</P>
<P>"She lives," replied Schedoni; "but you have nothing, therefore, to apprehend."</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a, &s;urpri&s;ed no le&s;s by the tone in which he &s;poke, and &s;hocked at the purport of his words, chan|ged countenance, while &s;he &s;aid, impatiently&mdash;"You &s;peak in enigmas, father,"</P>
<P>"Lady! I &s;peak plain truth&mdash;&s;he lives."</P>
<P>"I under&s;tand that &s;ufficiently," &s;aid the Marche&s;a, out when you tell me, I have nothing to apprehend."</P>
<P>"I tell you truth, al&s;o" rejoined; "the Confe&s;&s;or "and the benevolence of your nature may be per|mitted to rejoice, for ju&s;tice no longer has forbade the exerci&s;e of mercy."</P>
<P>"This is all very well in its place," &s;aid the Mar|che&s;a, betrayed by the vexation &s;he &s;uffered; &s;uch &s;en|timents and &s;uch compliments are like gala &s;uits, to be put on in fine weather. My day is cloudy; let me

have a little plain &s;en&s;e: inform me of the circum&s;tan|ces which have occa&s;ioned this change in the cour&s;e of your ob&s;ervations, and, good father! be brief."</P>
<P>Schedoni, then unfolded, with his u&s;ual art, &s;uch circum&s;tances relative to the family of Ellena as he hoped would &s;often the aver&s;ion of the Marche&s;a to the connection, and incline her in con&s;ideration of her &s;on's happine&s;s, finally to approve it; with which di&s;clo&s;ure he mingled a plau&s;ible relation of the way, in which the di&s;covery had been made.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a's patience would &s;carcely await the conclu&s;ion of his narrative, or her di&s;appointment &s;ub|mit to the curb of di&s;cretion. When at length, he had fini&s;hed his hi&s;tory "Is it po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid &s;he, with fret|ful di&s;plea&s;ure, "that you have &s;uffered your&s;elf to be deceived by the plau&s;ibility of a girl, who might have been expected to utter any fal&s;hood, which &s;hould ap|pear likely to protect her! Has a man of your di&s;cern|ment given faith to the idle and improbable tale! Say, rather, father, that your re&s;olution failed in the criti|cal moment, and that you are now anxious to form ex|cu&s;es to your&s;elf for a conduct &s;o pu&s;illanimous."</P>
<P>"I am not apt to give an ea&s;y faith to appearances," replied Schedoni, gravely, "and &s;till le&s;s to &s;hrink from the performance of any act, which I judge to be nece&s;|&s;ary and ju&s;t. To the la&s;t intimation, I make no re|ply; it does not become my character to vindicate my&s;elf from an implication of fal&s;hood."</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a, perceiving that her pa&s;&s;ion had be|trayed her into imprudence, conde&s;cended to apolo|gize for that which &s;he termed an effect of her extreme anxiety, as to what might follow from an act of &s;uch indi&s;creet indulgence; and Schedoni as willingly ac|cepted the apology, each believing the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Schedoni then informed her, that he had better au|thority for what he advanced than the a&s;&s;ertion of
<PB N="124" REF="032735_0414_0FF497E150C1B410">
Ellena; and he mentioned &s;ome circum&s;tances, which proved him to he more anxious for the reputation than for the truth of his word. Believing that his origin was entirely unknown to the Marche&s;a, he ventured to di&s;clo&s;e &s;ome particulars of Ellena's fami|ly, without apprehending that it could lead to a &s;u&s;|picion of his own.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a, though neither appea&s;ed or con|vinced, commanded her feelings &s;o far as to appear tranquil, while the Confe&s;&s;or repre&s;ented, with the mo&s;t delicate addre&s;s, the unhappine&s;s of her &s;on, and the &s;atisfaction, which mu&s;t finally re&s;ult to her&s;elf from an acquie&s;cence with his choice, &s;ince the object of it was known to be worthy of his alliance. He added, that while he had believed the contrary, he had proved him&s;elf as &s;trenuous to prevent, as he was now &s;incere in approving their marriage; and concluded with gently blameing her for &s;uffering prejudice and &s;ome remains of re&s;entment to ob&s;cure her excellent under&s;tanding. "Tru&s;ting to the natural clearne&s;s of your perception," he added, "I doubt not that wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> you have maturely con&s;idered the &s;ubject, eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> objection will yield to a con&s;ideration of your &s;on's happine&s;s."</P>
<P>The earne&s;tne&s;s with which Schedoni pleaded for Vivaldi, excited &s;ome &s;urprize; but the Marche&s;a, without conde&s;cending to reply either to his argument or remon&s;trance inquired whether Ellena had a &s;u&s;pi|cion of the de&s;ign, with which &s;he had been carried in|to the fore&s;ts of the Garganus, or concerning the iden|tity of her per&s;ecutor. Schedoni immediately perceiv|ing to what the&s;e que&s;tions tended, replied, with the facility with which he u&s;ually accommodated his con|&s;cience to his intere&s;t, that Ellena was totally ignorant as to who were her immediate per&s;ecutors, and equal|ly un&s;u&s;picious of any other evil having been intended her, than that of a temporary confinement.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="032735_0415_0FF49789882A39A8">
The la&s;t a&s;&s;ertion was admitted by the Marche&s;a to be probable, till the boldne&s;s of the fir&s;t made her doubt the truth of each, and occa&s;ioned her new &s;ur|prize and conjecture as to the motive, which could induce Schedoni to venture the&s;e untruths. She then inquired where Ellena was now di&s;po&s;ed of, but he had too much prudence to di&s;clo&s;e the place of her re|treat, however plau&s;ible might be the air with which the inquiry was urged; and he endeavoured to call off her attention to Vivaldi. The Confe&s;&s;or did not, however, venture, at pre&s;ent to give a hint as to the pretended di&s;covery of his &s;ituation in the inqui&s;ition, but re&s;erved to a more favourable opportunity &s;uch mention, together with the zealous offer of his &s;ervi|ces to extricate the pri&s;oner. The Marche&s;a, believ|ing that her &s;on was &s;till engaged in pur&s;uit of Ellena, made many inquiries concerning him, but without ex|pre&s;&s;ing any &s;olicitude for his welfare; re&s;entment ap|pearing to be the only emotion &s;he retained towards him. While Schedoni replied with circum&s;pection to her que&s;tions, he urged inquiries of his own, as to the manner in which the Marche&s;a endured the long ab&s;ence of Vivaldi; thus endeavouring to a&s;certain how far he might hereafter venture to appear in any efforts for liberating him, and how &s;hape his conduct re&s;pecting Ellena. It &s;eemed that the Marche&s;e was not indifferent as to his &s;on's ab&s;ence; and though he had at fir&s;t believed the &s;earch for Ellena to have occa|&s;ioned it, other apprehen&s;ions now di&s;turbed him, and taught him the feelings of a father. His numerous avocations and intere&s;ts, however, &s;eemed to prevent &s;uch anxiety from preying upon his mind; and having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed per&s;ons in &s;earch of Vivaldi, he pa&s;&s;ed his time in the u&s;ual routine of company and the court. Of the actual &s;ituation of his &s;on, it was evident that neither he, nor the Marche&s;a, had th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> lea&s;t apprehen|&s;ion, and this was a circum&s;tance, which the Confe&s;|&s;or was very careful to a&s;certain.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="032735_0416_0FF497EC97EDDAC0">
Before he took leave he ventured to renew the men|tion of Vivaldi's attachment, and gently to plead f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> him. The Marche&s;a, however, &s;eemed inattentive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> what he repre&s;ented, till, at length, awaking from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> reverie, &s;he &s;aid&mdash;"Father, you have judged ill&mdash;and, before &s;he concluded the &s;entence, &s;he relap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> again into thoughtful &s;ilence.

<P>"You have judged erroniou&s;ly, father" re&s;umed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Marche&s;a with the &s;ame con&s;idering air, "in placing the girl in &s;uch a &s;ituation; my &s;on cannot fail to di&s;|cover her there."</P>
<P>"Or wherever &s;he may be" replied the Confe&s;&s;or, believing that he under&s;tood the Marche&s;a's aim, "it may not be po&s;&s;ible to conceal her long from his &s;earch."</P>
<P>"The neighbourhood of Naples ought at lea&s;t to have been avoided," ob&s;erved the Marche&s;a,</P>
<P>Schedoni was &s;ilent, and &s;he added, "So near, al&s;o, to his own re&s;idence! How far is the <HI>Santa della Pie|ta</HI> from the Vivaldi palace?"</P>
<P>Though Schedoni had thought that the Marche&s;a, while di&s;playing a pretended knowledge of Ellena's retreat, was only endeavouring to obtain a real one, this mention of the place of her actual re&s;idence &s;hocked him; but he replied almo&s;t immediately, "I am ignorant of the di&s;tance, for, till now, I was unac|quainted that there is a convent of the name you men|tion. It appears, however, that this <HI>Santa della Pie|ta</HI> is the place, of all other, which ought to have been avoided. How could you &s;u&s;pect me, lady, of imprudence thus extravagant!"</P>
<P>While Schedoni &s;poke, the Marche&s;a regarded him attentively, and then replied, "I may be allowed, good father, to &s;u&s;pect your prudence in this in&s;tance,
<PB N="127" REF="032735_0417_0FF4978B0EED7CC8">
&s;ince you have ju&s;t given me &s;o unequivocal a proof of it in another."</P>
<P>She would then have changed the &s;ubject but, Schedoni, believing this inclination to be the con&s;e|quence of her having a&s;&s;ured her&s;elf, that &s;he had ac|tually di&s;covered Ellena's a&s;ylum, and too rea&s;onably &s;u&s;pecting the dreadful u&s;e &s;he de&s;igned to make of the di&s;covery, endeavoured to un&s;ettle her opinion, and mi&s;lead her as to the place of Ellena's abode. He not only contradicted the fact of her pre&s;ent re&s;idence at the <HI>Santa della Pieta,</HI> but, without &s;cruple, made a po|&s;itive a&s;&s;ertion, that &s;he was at a di&s;tance from Na|ples, nameing at the &s;ame time, a fictious place, who&s;e ob&s;curity, he added, would be the be&s;t protection from the pur&s;uit of Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Very true, father," ob&s;erved the Marche&s;a; "I believe that my &s;on will not readily di&s;cover the girl in the place you have named."</P>
<P>Whether the Marche&s;a believed Schedoni's a&s;&s;er|tion or not, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed no farther curio&s;ity on the &s;ubject, and appeared con&s;iderably more tranquil than before. She now chatted with ea&s;e on general topics, while the Confe&s;&s;or dared no more to urge the &s;ub|ject of his &s;ecret wi&s;hes; and having &s;upported for &s;ome time, a conver&s;ation mo&s;t uncongenial with his temper, he took his leave, and returned to Naples. On the way thither, he reviewed with exactne&s;s, the late behaviour of the Marche&s;a, and the re&s;ult of this examination was a re&s;olution&mdash;never to renew the &s;ubject of their conver&s;ation, but to &s;olemnize, with|out her con&s;ent, the nuptials of Vivaldi and El|lena.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a, meanwhile, on the departure of Schedoni, remained in the attitude in which he had left her, and ab&s;orbed by the intere&s;t, which his vi&s;it excited. The &s;udden change in his conduct no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed and perplexed, than di&s;appointed her, She

could not explain it by the &s;uppo&s;ition of any princi|ple, or motive. Sometimes it occurred to her, that Vivaldi had bribed him with rich promi&s;es, to promote the marriage, which he contributed to thwart; but, when &s;he con&s;idered the high expectations &s;he had her&s;elf encouraged him to cheri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n, the improbability of the conjecture was apparent. That Schedoni, from whatever cau&s;e, was no longer to be tru&s;ted in this bu&s;ine&s;s, was &s;ufficiently clear, but &s;he endeavoured to con&s;ole her&s;elf with a hope that a more confidential per&s;on might yet be di&s;covered. A part of Schedoni's re&s;olution &s;he al&s;o adopted, which was, never again to introduce the &s;ubject of their late conver&s;ation.

<P>ELLENA, obedient to the command of Schedo|ni, withdrew from her home on the day that followed her arrival there, to the <HI>Santa della Pieta.</HI> The Superior, who had known her from her infancy, and from the acquaintance which &s;uch long ob&s;ervation af|forded, had both e&s;teemed and loved her, received El|lena with a degree of &s;atisfaction proportionate to the concern &s;he had &s;uffered when informed of her di&s;a&s;|trous removal from the Villa Altieri.</P>
<P>Among the quiet groves of this convent, however, Ellena vainly endeavoured to moderate her &s;olicitude re&s;pecting the &s;ituation of Vivaldi; for, now that &s;he had a re&s;pite from immediate calamity, &s;he thought with more inten&s;e anxiety as to what might be his &s;uf|ferings, and her fears and impatience encrea&s;ed, as each day di&s;appointed her expectation of intelligence from Schedoni.</P>
<P>If the &s;oothings of &s;ympathy and the delicate arts of benevolence could have re&s;tored the &s;erenity of her mind, Ellena would now have been peaceful; for all the&s;e were offered her by the abbe&s;s and the &s;i&s;ters of the <HI>Santa della Pieta.</HI> They were not acquainted

Whatever might be her failings they were effectually concealed by the general benevolence of her heart, and the harmony of her mind; a harmo|ny, not the effect of torpid feelings, but the accom|pli&s;hment of correct and vigilant judgment. Her re|ligion was neither gloomy nor bigotted; it was the &s;entiment of a grateful heart offering it&s;elf up to a Deity, who delights in the happine&s;s of his creatures and &s;he conformed to the cu&s;toms of the Roman church without &s;uppo&s;ing a faith in all of them to be nece&s;&s;a|ry to &s;alvation.

<P>In her lectures to the nuns &s;he &s;eldom touched upon points of faith, but explained and enforced the moral

duties, particularly &s;uch as were mo&s;t practicable in the &s;ociety to which &s;he belonged; &s;uch as tended to &s;often and harmonize the affections, to impart that repo&s;e of mind, which per&s;uades to the practice of &s;i&s;terly kind|ne&s;s, univer&s;al charity, and the mo&s;t pure and elevated devotion. When &s;he &s;poke of religion, it appeared &s;o intere&s;ting, &s;o beautiful, that her attentive auditors re|vered and loved it as a friend, a refiner of the heart, a &s;ublime con&s;oler; and experienced &s;omewhat of the meek and holy ardour, which may belong to angelic natures.</P>
<P>The &s;ociety appeared like a large family, of which the lady abbe&s;s was the mother, rather than an a&s;&s;em|blage of &s;trangers: and particularly when gathered a|round her, they li&s;tened to the evening &s;ermon, which &s;he delivered with &s;uch affectionate, intere&s;t, &s;uch per|&s;ua&s;ive eloquence, and &s;ometimes with &s;uch pathetic energy, as few hearts could re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>She encouraged in her convent every innocent and liberal pur&s;uit, which might &s;weeten the au&s;terities of confinement, and which were generally rendered in|&s;trumental to charity. The <HI>Daughters of Pity</HI> parti|cularly excelled in mu&s;ic; not in tho&s;e difficulties of the art, which di&s;play florid graces, and intricate exe|cution, but in &s;uch eloquence of &s;ound as &s;teals upon the heart, and awakens its &s;weete&s;t and be&s;t affections.

Along the windings of the coa&s;t, too, &s;he could di&s;tingui&s;h many places rendered &s;acred by affection, to which &s;he had made excur&s;ions with her lamented relative and Vivaldi; and though &s;adne&s;s mingled with the recollections a view of them re&s;tored, they were precious to her heart. Here, alone and unob&s;erved, &s;he frequently yielded to the melancholy which &s;he endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s in &s;ociety; and at other times tried to deceive, with books and pencil, the lingering moments of uncertainty con|cerning the &s;tate of Vivaldi; for day after day &s;till elap|&s;ed without bringing any intelligence from Schedoni. Whenever the late &s;cenes connected with the di&s;covery of her family recurred to Ellena, &s;he was &s;truck with almo&s;t as much amazement as if &s;he was gazing upon a vi&s;ion, in&s;tead of recalling realities. Contra&s;ted with the &s;ober truth of her pre&s;ent life, the pa&s;t appeared like romance; and there were moments when &s;he &s;hrunk from the relation&s;hip of Schedoni with unconquera|ble affright. The fir&s;t emotions his appearance had excited were &s;o oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of filial tenderne&s;s, that &s;he perceived it was now nearly impo&s;&s;ible to love and revere him as her father, and &s;he endeavoured, by dwelling upon all the obligations, which &s;he believed he had lately conferred upon her, to repay him a gra|titude, what was withheld in affection.</P>
<P>In &s;uch melancholy con&s;iderations, &s;he often linger|ed under the &s;hade of the accacias, till the &s;un had &s;unk behind the far di&s;tant promontory of Mi&s;eno&punc; and the la&s;t bell of ve&s;pers &s;ummoned her to the convent below.</P>
<P>Among the nuns, Ellena had many favourites, but not one that &s;he admired and loved equally with Oli|via of San Stefano, the remembrance of whom was al|ways accompanied with a fear le&s;t &s;he &s;hould have &s;uf|fered

To Ellena, the magnificent &s;cenes of the <HI>Santa della Pieta</HI> &s;eem|ed to open a &s;ecure, and perhaps a la&s;t a&s;ylum; for, is her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, &s;he could not avoid perceiv|ing how menancing and various were the objections to her marriage with Vivaldi, even &s;hould Schedoni prove propitious to it. The character of the Mar|che&s;a di Vivaldi, &s;uch as it &s;tood unfolded by the late occurrences, &s;truck her with di&s;may, for her de&s;igns appeared &s;ufficiently atrocious, whether they had ex|tended to the utmo&s;t limit of Ellena's &s;u&s;picions, or had &s;topped where the affected charity of Schedoni had pointed out. In either ca&s;e, the pertinacity of her aver&s;ion, and the vindictive violence of her nature, were obvious. In this view of her character, how|ever, it was not the inconvenience threatened to tho&s;e who might become connected with her, that princi|pally affected Ellena, but the circum&s;tance of &s;uch a woman being the mother of Vivaldi; and to alleviate &s;o afflicting a con&s;ideration, &s;he endeavourd to believe all the palliating &s;ugge&s;tions of Schedoni, re&s;pecting the Marche&s;a's late intentions. But if Ellena was griev|ed on di&s;covering crime, in the character of Vivaldi's parent, what would have been her &s;uffering, had &s;he &s;u&s;pected the nature of Schedoni?&mdash;what, if &s;he had been told that he was the advi&s;er of the Mar|che&s;a's plans?&mdash;if &s;he had known that he had been the partner of her intentional guilt? From &s;uch &s;uffering &s;he was yet &s;pared, as well&punc; as from that which a knowledge of Vivaldi's pre&s;ent &s;ituation and of the re&s;ult of Schedoni's efforts to procure a relea&s;e from the perils, among which he had preci|pitated him, would have inflicted.

<P>WHILE the late events had been pa&s;&s;ing in the Garganus, and at Naples, Vivaldi and his &s;er|vent Paulo, remained impri&s;oned in di&s;tinct chambers of the Inqui&s;ition. They were again &s;eparately inter|rogated. From the &s;ervant no information could be obtained; he a&s;&s;erted only his ma&s;ter's innocence, with|out once remembring to mention his own; clamoured, with more ju&s;tice than prudence, again&s;t the per&s;ons who had occa&s;ioned his arre&s;t; &s;eriou&s;ly endeavouring to convince the inqui&s;itors, that he him&s;elf had <HI>no other mo|tive</HI> in having demanded to be brought to the&s;e pri&s;ons than that he might comfort his ma&s;ter, he gravely re|mon&s;trated on the inju&s;tice of &s;eparating them, adding, that he was &s;ure when they knew the rights of the matter, they would order him to be carried to the pri|&s;on of Signor Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"I do a&s;&s;ure your <HI>Sereni&s;&s;imo Illu&s;tru&s;&s;imo,</HI>" contin|ued Paulo, addre&s;&s;ing the chief inqui&s;itor with pro|found gravity, "that this is the la&s;t place I &s;hould have thought of coming to, on any other account; and if you will only conde&s;cend to a&s;k your officials, who took my ma&s;ter up, they will tell you <HI>as g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">od.</HI> They knew well enough all along, what I came here for, and if they had known it would be all in vain' it would have been but civil of them to have told me as much, and not have brought me; for this is the la&s;t place in the world I would have come to, otherwi&s;e, of my own accord."</P>
<P>Paulo was permitted to harangue in his own way,
<PB N="137" REF="032735_0427_0FF4979FB423E680">
becau&s;e his examiners hoped that his prolixity would be a means of betraying circum&s;tances connected with his ma&s;ter. By this veiw, however, they were mi&s;led, for Paulo, with all his &s;implicity of heart, was both vi|gilant and &s;hrewd in Vivaldi's intere&s;t. But, when he perceived them really convinced, that his &s;ole motive for vi&s;iting the Inqui&s;ition was that he might con&s;ole his ma&s;ter, yet &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in the re&s;olution of &s;epa|rately confining him, his indignation knew no bounds. He depi&s;ed alike their reprehen&s;ion, their thunder|ing menaces, and their more artful exhibitions; told them of all they had to expect both here and here|after, for their cruelty to his dear ma&s;ter, and &s;aid they might do what they would with him; he defied them to make him more mi&s;erable than he was.</P>
<P>It was not without difficulty that he was removed from the chamber, where he left his examiners in a &s;tate of a&s;toni&s;hment at his ra&s;hne&s;s, and indignation of his hone&s;ty, &s;uch as they had, probably never experi|enced before.</P>
<P>When Vivaldi was again called up to the table of the Holy Office, he underwent a longer examination than on a former occa&s;ion. Several inqui&s;itors atten|ded, and every art was employed to induce him to con|fe&s;s crimes, of which he was &s;u&s;pected, and to draw from him a di&s;covery of others which might have elu|ded even &s;u&s;picion. Still the examiners cautiou&s;ly a|voided informing him of the &s;ubject of the accu&s;ation on which he had been arre&s;ted, and it was, therefore, only on the former a&s;&s;urances of the Benedictine, and the officials in the chaple of San Seba&s;tian, that Vi|valid under&s;tood he was accu&s;ed of having carried off a nun. His an&s;wers on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion were con|ci&s;e and firm, and his whole deportment undaunted. He felt le&s;s apprehen&s;ion for him&s;elf, than indignation of the general inju&s;tice and cruelty, which the tribunal was permitted to exerci&s;e upon others; and this virtu|ous
<PB N="138" REF="032735_0428_0FF497FE95CAA4D0">
indignation gave a loftine&s;s, a calm heroic gran|duer to his mind, which never, for a moment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him, except when he conjectured what might be the &s;ufferings of Ellena. Then, his fortitude and magna|nimity failed, and his tortured &s;pirit ro&s;e almo&s;t to fren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">.</P>
<P>On this, his &s;econd examination, he was urged by the &s;ame dark que&s;tions, and replied to them with the &s;ame open &s;incerity, as during the fir&s;t. Yet the &s;im|plicity and energy of truth failed to impre&s;s conviction on minds, which, no longer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the virtue them|&s;elves, were not competent to under&s;tand the &s;ymptom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of it in others, Vivaldi was again threatened wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> the torture, and again di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to his pri&s;on.</P>
<P>On the way to this dreadful abode, a per&s;on pa&s;&s;ed him in one of the avenues, of who&s;e air and figure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thought he had &s;ome recollection; and, as the &s;tranger &s;talked away, he &s;uddenly knew him to be the prophe|tic monk, who had haunted him among the ruins of Paluzzi. In the fir&s;t moment of &s;urpri&s;e, Vivaldi lo&s;t his pre&s;ence of mind &s;o far, that he made no attempt to interrupt him. In the next in&s;tance, however, he pau|&s;ed and looked back, with an intention of &s;peaking; but this my&s;terious per&s;on was already at the extremi|ty of the avenue. Vivaldi called, and be&s;ought him to &s;top. Without either &s;peaking or turning his head, however, he immediately di&s;appeared beyond a door that opened at his approach. Vivaldi on attempting to take the way of the monk, was withheld by his guards, and, when he inquired who was the &s;tranger he had &s;een, the officials a&s;ked, in their turn, what &s;tran|ger he alluded to.</P>
<P>"He who has ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed us," replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>The officials &s;eemed &s;urprized, "Your &s;pirits are di&s;ordered, Signor," ob&s;erved one of them, "I &s;aw no per&s;on pa&s;s!</P>
<P>"He pa&s;&s;ed &s;o clo&s;ely," &s;aid Vivaldi, "that it was hardly po&s;&s;ible you could avoid &s;eeing him!"</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="032735_0429_0FF497A2298C7598">
"I did not even hear a foot&s;tep!" added the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>"I do not recollect that I did," an&s;wered Vivaldi, "but I &s;aw his figure as plainly as I now &s;ee your's; his black garments almo&s;t touched me! Was he an inqui&s;itor?"</P>
<P>The official appeared a&s;toni&s;hed; and, whether his &s;urprize was real, or affected for the purpo&s;e of conceal|ing his knowledge of the per&s;on alluded to, his em|barra&s;&s;ment and awe &s;eemed natural. Vivaldi ob&s;erv|ed, with almo&s;t equal curio&s;ity and &s;urprize, the fear which his face expre&s;&s;ed; but perceived al&s;o, that it would avail nothing to repeat his que&s;tions.</P>
<P>As they proceeded along the avenue, a kind of half|&s;tifled groan was &s;ometimes audible from a di&s;tance. "Whence come the&s;e &s;ounds?" &s;aid Vivaldi, "they &s;trike to my heart!"</P>
<P>"They &s;hould do &s;o," replied the guard.</P>
<P>"Whence come they?" repeated Vivaldi, more impatiently, and &s;huddering.</P>
<P>"From the place of torture," &s;aid the official.</P>
<P>"O God! O God!" exclaimed Vivaldi, with a deep groan,</P>
<P>He pa&s;&s;ed with ha&s;ty &s;teps the door of that terrible chamber, and the guard did not attempt to &s;top him. The officials had brought him, in obedience to the cu&s;tomary orders they had received, within hearing of tho&s;e doleful &s;ounds for the purpo&s;e of impre&s;&s;ing upon his mind the horrors of the puni&s;hment, with which he was threatened, and of inducing him to confe&s;s without incurring them.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame evening, Vivaldi was vi&s;ited, in his pri&s;on, by a man whom he had never con&s;ciou&s;ly &s;een before. He appeared to be between forty and fifty; was of a grave and ob&s;ervant phy&s;iognomy, and of manners, which, though &s;omewhat au&s;tere, were not alarming. The account he gave of him&s;elf, and of his
<PB N="140" REF="032735_0430_0FF498001D3ECD18">
motive for this vi&s;it, was curious. He &s;aid that he al&s;o was a pri&s;oner in the inqui&s;ition, but, as the ground of accu&s;ation again&s;t him was light, he had been fa|voured &s;o far as to be allowed &s;ome degree of liberty within certain bounds&punc; that, having heard of Vivaldi's &s;ituation, he had a&s;ked and obtained leave to conver&s;e with him, which he had done in compa&s;&s;ion, &amp; with a de&s;ire of a&s;&s;uaging his &s;ufferings, &s;o far as an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;ympathy and commi&s;eration might relieve them.</P>
<P>While he &s;poke, Vivaldi regarded him with deep at|tention, and the improbability that tho&s;e preten&s;ion &s;hould be true, did not e&s;cape him&punc; but the &s;u&s;picion which they occa&s;ioned he prudently concealed. The &s;tranger conver&s;ed on various &s;ubjects. Vivaldi's an|&s;wers were cautious and conci&s;e; but not even long pau&s;es of &s;ilence wearied the compa&s;&s;ionate patience of his vi&s;itor. Among other topics, he, at length, in|troduced that of religion.</P>
<P>"I have my&s;elf, been accu&s;ed of here&s;y," &s;aid he, "and know how to pity others in the &s;ame &s;ituation,"</P>
<P>"It is of here&s;y, then, that I am accu&s;ed!" inter|rupted Vivaldi, "of here&s;y!"</P>
<P>"It availed me nothing that I a&s;&s;erted my innocence," continued the &s;tranger, without noticing Vivaldi's ex|clamation, "I was condemned to the torture. My &s;ufferings were too terrible to be endured! I confe&s;&s;ed my offence&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Pardon me," interrupted Vivaldi, "but allow me to ob&s;erve, that &s;ince your &s;ufferings were &s;o &s;evere, your's again&s;t whom the ground of accu&s;ation was light, what may be the puni&s;hment of tho&s;e, who&s;e offences are more &s;erious!"</P>
<P>The &s;tranger was &s;omewhat embarra&s;&s;ed. "My offence was &s;light," he continued, without giving a full an&s;wer.</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid Vivaldi, again interrupting him, "that here&s;y can be con&s;idered as a &s;light offence before the tribunal of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">."</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="032735_0431_0FF497A3B6F8FF80">
"It was only of a &s;light degree of here&s;y," replied he vi&s;itor, reddening with di&s;plea&s;ure, "that I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ected, and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Does then the Inqui&s;ition allow of degrees in cre&s;y?" &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"I confe&s;&s;ed my offence," added the &s;tranger with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">louder empha&s;is, and the con&s;equence of this confe&s;|io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> was a remi&s;&s;ion of puni&s;hment.

<P>The latter part of the &s;peech was delivered in a low <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oice, as if the &s;tranger feared to be overheard. Vi|valdi remained &s;ilent, while he examined, with clo&s;er attention, the countenance of his vi&s;itor. It was of he utmo&s;t importance to him, that his family &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e made acquainted with his &s;ituation; yet he knew not exactly how to interpret, or to confide in this offer. Vivaldi had heard that informers &s;ometimes vi&s;ited the pri&s;oners, and, under the affectation of kindne&s;s and &s;ympathy, drew from them a confe&s;&s;ion of opinions, which were afterwards urged again&s;t them; and obtained di&s;coveries relative to their con|nections and friends, who were, by the&s;e in&s;idious means, frequently involved in their de&s;truction. Vi|valdi, con&s;cious of his own innocence, had on his fir&s;t examination, acquainted the inqui&s;itor with the names and re&s;idence of his family; he had, therefore. nothing new to apprehend from revealing them to this &s;tranger; but he perceived that if it &s;hould be known he had attempted to convey a me&s;&s;age, however con|ci&s;e and harmle&s;s, the di&s;covery would irritate the jea|lous inqui&s;itors again&s;t him, and might be urged as a new pre&s;umption of his guilt. The&s;e con&s;ide|rations,
<PB N="142" REF="032735_0432_0FF4980C78AFAC48">
together with the di&s;tru&s;t which the incon|&s;i&s;tency of his vi&s;itor's a&s;&s;ertions, and the occa&s;ional embarra&s;&s;ment of his manner, had awakened, deter|mined Vivaldi to re&s;i&s;t the temptation now offered to him; and the &s;tranger, having received his thanks, reluctantly withdrew, ob&s;erving however, that &s;hould any unfore&s;een circum&s;tance detain him in the Inqui|&s;ition longer than he had rea&s;on to expect, he &s;hould beg leave to pay him another vi&s;it. In reply to this, Vivaldi only bowed, but he remarked, that the &s;trang|er's countenance changed, and that &s;ome dark brood|ing appeared to cloud his mind, as he quitted the chamber.</P>
<P>Several days elap&s;ed, during which Vivaldi heard no more of his new acquaintance. He was then &s;um|moned to another examination, from which he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed as before; and &s;ome weeks of &s;olitude and of heavy uncertainty &s;ucceeded, after which he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a fourth time called up to the table of the Holy Office. It was then &s;urrounded by inqui&s;itors, and a more tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> u&s;ual &s;olemnity appeared in the proceedings,</P>
<P>As proofs of Vivaldi's innocence had not been de|tained, the &s;u&s;picions of the examiners, of cour&s;e, were not removed; and, as he per&s;i&s;ted in denying the truth of the charge which he under&s;tood would be exhibited again&s;t him, and refu&s;ed to make any confe&s;&s;ion of crimes, it was ordered that he &s;hould, within three hours, be put to the <HI>que&s;tion.</HI> Till then, Vivaldi was once more di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to his pri&s;on chamber. He re&s;olution remained un&s;haken, but he could not lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> unmoved, upon the horrors which might be preparing for him. The interval of expectation between the &s;entence and the accompli&s;hment of this preliminary puni&s;hment, was, indeed, dreadful. The &s;eeming ig|nominy of his &s;ituation, and his ignorance as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> degree of torture to he applied, overcame the calm|ne&s;s he had before exhibited, and as he paced his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="143" REF="032735_0433_0FF497A541CC57A8">
cold damps, which hung on his forehead, betrayed the agony of his mind. It was not long, however, that he &s;uffered from a &s;en&s;e of ignominy; his better judg|ment &s;hewed him, that innocence cannot &s;uffer di&s;|grace from any &s;ituation or circum&s;tance, and he once more re&s;umed the courage and the firmne&s;s which be|long to virtue.</P>
<P>It was about midnight, that Vivaldi heard &s;teps approaching, and a murmer of voices at the door of his cell. He under&s;tood the&s;e to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e the per&s;ons come to &s;ummon him to the torture. The door was un|barred, and two men, habited in black, appeared at it. Without &s;peaking, they advanced, and throwing over him a &s;ingular&punc; kind of mantle, led him from the chamber.</P>
<P>Along the galleries, and other avenues through which they pa&s;&s;ed, not any per&s;on was &s;een, and, by the profound &s;tillne&s;s that reigned, it &s;eemed as if death had already anticipated his work in the&s;e regions of horror, and had condemned alike the tortured and the torturer.</P>
<P>They de&s;cended to the large hall, where Vivaldi had waited on the night of his entrance, and thence through an avenue, and down a long flight of &s;teps that led to &s;ubterranean chambers. His conductors did not utter a &s;yllable during the whole progre&s;s; Vivaldi knew too well that que&s;tions would only &s;ub|ject him to greater &s;everity, and he a&s;ked none.</P>
<P>The doors, through which they pa&s;&s;ed, regularly o|pened at the touch of an iron rod, carried by one of the officials, and without the appearance of any per|&s;on. The other man bore a torch, and the pa&s;&s;ages were &s;o dimly lighted that the way could &s;carcely have been found without one. They cro&s;&s;ed what &s;eemed to be a burial vault, but the extent and ob&s;curity of the place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not allow it to be a&s;certained; and, having reached an iron door, they, &s;topped. One of
<PB N="144" REF="032735_0434_0FF4980E018603C0">
the officials &s;truck upon it three times with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> but it did not open as the others had done. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they waited, Vivaldi thought he heard, from wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> low intermitting &s;ounds, as of per&s;ons in their la&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|tremity, but, though within they appeared to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from a di&s;tance. His whole heart was chilled, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fear, for at that moment he did not remember <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> but with horror.</P>
<P>Having waited a con&s;iderable time, during which the official did not repeat the &s;ignal, the door was part|ly opened by a per&s;on whom Vivaldi could not di&s;|tingui&s;h in the gloom beyond, and with whom one of his conductors communicated by &s;igns; after whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> the door was clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Several minutes had elap&s;ed, when tones of deep voices arou&s;ed the attention of Vivaldi. They were loud and hoar&s;e, and &s;poke in a language unknown to him. At the &s;ounds, the official immediately extin|gui&s;hed his torch. The voices drew nearer, and, the door again unfolding, two figures &s;tood before Vival|di, which &s;hewn by a glimmering light within &s;truck him with a&s;toni&s;hment and di&s;may. The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> were cloathed, like his conductors, in black, but in a different fa&s;hion, for their habits were made clo&s;e to the &s;hape. Their faces were entirely concealed beneath a very peculiar kind of cowl, which de&s;cended from the head to the feet; and their eyes only were vi&s;ible through &s;mall openings contrived for the &s;ight. It occured to Vivaldi that the&s;e men were torturers their appearance was worthy of demons. Proba|bly they were thus habited, that the per&s;ons whom they afflicted might not know them; or, perhaps, it was only for the purpo&s;e of &s;triking terror upon the minds of the accu&s;ed, and thus compelling them to confe&s;s without further difficulty. Whatever motive might have occa&s;ioned their horri&s;ic appearance, and whatever was their office, Vivaldi was delivered into
<PB N="145" REF="032735_0435_0FF497B0664EEA50">
their hands, and, in the &s;ame moment, heard the iron door &s;hut which enclo&s;ed him with them in a narrow pa&s;&s;age, gloomily lighted by a lamp &s;u&s;pended from the arched roof. They walked in &s;ilence on each &s;ide of their pri&s;oner, and came to a &s;econd door which ad|mitted them in&s;tantly into another pa&s;&s;age. A third door, at a &s;hort di&s;tance; admitted them to a third a|venue, at the end of which, one of his my&s;terious guides &s;truck upon a gate, and they &s;topped. The un|certain &s;ounds that Vivaldi had fancied he heard, were now more audible, and he di&s;tingui&s;hed, with inex|pre&s;&s;ible horror, that they were uttered by per&s;ons &s;uf|fering.</P>
<P>The gate was at length opened by a figure habited like his conductors, and two other doors of iron, placed very near each other, being al&s;o unlocked, Vivaldi found him&s;elf in a &s;pacious chamber, the walls of which were hung with black, du&s;kily lighted by lamps that gleamed in the lofty vault. Immediately on his en|trance, a &s;trange &s;ound ran along the walls, and echoed among other vaults, that appeared, by the progre&s;s of the &s;ound, to extend far beyond this.</P>
<P>It was not immediately that Vivaldi could &s;ufficient|ly recollect him&s;elf to ob&s;erve any object before him; and even when he did &s;o, the gloom of the place pre|vented his a&s;certaining many appearances. Shadowy countenances and uncertain forms &s;eemed to flit through the du&s;k, and many in&s;truments, the application of which he did not comprehend, &s;truck him with horri|ble &s;u&s;picions. Still he heard, at intervals, half &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed groans, and was looking round to di&s;cover the wretched people from whom they were extorted, when a voice from a remote part of the chamber, called on him to advance.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance, and the ob&s;curity of the &s;pot whence the voice i&s;&s;ued, had prevented Vivaldi from noticing any per&s;on there, and he was now &s;lowly obeying, when
<PB N="146" REF="032735_0436_0FF4980F881D7420">
on a &s;econd &s;ummons, his conductors &s;eized his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and hurried him forward.</P>
<P>In a remoet part of this exten&s;ive chamber, he per|ceived three per&s;ons &s;eated under a black canopy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> chairs rai&s;ed &s;everal &s;teps from the floor, and who ap|peared to pre&s;ide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">here in the office of either judges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> examiners, or directors of the puni&s;hments. Below, at a table, &s;at a &s;ecretary, over whom was &s;u&s;pended, the only lamp that could enable him to commit to pa|per what &s;hould occur during the examination. Vi|valdi now under&s;tood, that the three per&s;ons who com|po&s;ed the tribunal were the vicar-general, or grand in|qui&s;itor, the advocate of the exchequer, and an ordina|ry inqui&s;itor, who was &s;eated between the other two and who appeared more eagerly to engage in the du|ties of his cruel office. A portentious ob&s;curity en|velloped alike their per&s;ons and their proceedings.</P>
<P>At &s;ome di&s;tance from the tribunal &s;tood a large i|ron frame, which Vivaldi conjectured to be the rack, and near it another, re&s;embling, in &s;hape, a coffin but, happily, he could not di&s;tingui&s;h through the re|mote ob&s;curity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> per&s;on undergoing actual &s;uffer|ing. In the vaults beyond, however, the diabolical decrees of the inqui&s;itors &s;eemed to be fulfilling; for whenever a di&s;tant door opened for a moment, &s;ounds of lamentation i&s;&s;ued forth, and men whom he judges to be familiars, habited like tho&s;e who &s;tood be&s;ide him were &s;een pa&s;&s;ing to and fro within.</P>
<P>Vivaldi almo&s;t believed him&s;elf in the infernal re|gions; the di&s;mal a&s;pect of this place, the horrible pre|paration for puni&s;hment, and, above all, the di&s;po&s;ition and appearance of the per&s;ons that were ready to in|flict it, confirmed the re&s;emblance. That any human being, &s;hould afflict a fellow being who had never in|jured, or even offended him; that, un&s;wayed by pa&s;&s;i|on, he &s;hould deliberately become the means of tortur|ing him, appeared to Vivaldi nearly incredible! But
<PB N="147" REF="032735_0437_0FF497B1ED8F0A48">
when he looked at the three per&s;ons who compo&s;ed the tribunal, and con&s;idered that they had not only volun|tarily undertaken the cruel office they fulfilled, but had probably long regarded it as the &s;ummit of their ambi|tion, his a&s;toni&s;hment &amp; indignation were unbounded.</P>
<P>The grand inqui&s;itor having again called on Vival|di by name, admoni&s;hed him to confe&s;s the truth, and avoid the &s;uffering that awaited him.</P>
<P>As Vivaldi had, on former examinations, &s;poken the truth, which was not believed, he had no chance of e&s;|caping pre&s;ent &s;uffering, but by a&s;&s;erting fal&s;hood: in doing &s;o, to avoid &s;uch mon&s;trous inju&s;tice and cruelty he might, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erhaps, have been ju&s;tified, had it been cer|tain, that &s;uch a&s;&s;ertion could affect him&s;elf alone; but &s;ince he knew that the con&s;equence mu&s;t extend to o|thers, and above all, believed that Ellena di Ro&s;alba mu&s;t be involv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d in it, he did not he&s;itate for an in|&s;tant, to dare whatever torture his firmne&s;s might provoke. But even if morality could have forgiven fal&s;hood in &s;uch extraordinary circum&s;tances as the&s;e, policy, after all, would have forbidden it, &s;ince a di&s;co|very of the artifice would probably have led to the fi|nal de&s;truction of the accu&s;ed per&s;on.</P>
<P>Of Ellena's &s;ituation he would now have a&s;ked, however de&s;perate the que&s;tion; would again have a&s;|&s;erted her innocence, and &s;upplicated for compa&s;&s;ion, even to inqui&s;itors, had he not perceived that, in doing &s;o, he &s;hould only furni&s;h them with a more exqui&s;ite means of torturing him than any other they could ap|ply; for if, when all the terrors of his &s;oul concerning her were under&s;tood, they &s;hould threaten to increa&s;e her &s;ufferings, as the puni&s;hment of what was termed his ob&s;tinacy, they would, indeed, become ma&s;ters of his integrity, as well as of his per&s;on.</P>
<P>The tribunal again, and repeatedly, urged Vivaldi to confe&s;s him&s;elf guilty; and the inqui&s;itor, at length concluded, with &s;aying that the judges were innocent
<PB N="148" REF="032735_0438_0FF498110F929280">
of whatever con&s;equence might en&s;ue from his ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|nacy; &s;o that, if he expired beneath his &s;uffering him&s;elf only, not they, would have occa&s;ioned his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>"I am innocent of the charges which I under&s;tand are urged again&s;t me; &s;aid Vivald, with &s;olemnity. "I repeat, that I am innocent! If to e&s;cape the horror of the&s;e moments, I could be weak enough to declare my&s;elf guilty, not all your racks could alter truth, and make me &s;o, except in that a&s;&s;ertion. The con&s;equence of your tortures, therefore, be upon your own heads!</P>
<P>While Vivaldi &s;poke, the vicar-general li&s;tened with attention, and when he had cea&s;ed to &s;peak, ap|peared to meditate; but the inqui&s;itor was irritated by the boldne&s;s of his &s;peech, in&s;tead of being convinced by the ju&s;tne&s;s of his repre&s;entation and made a &s;ignal for the officers to prepare for the que&s;tion. While they were obeyiug, Vivaldi ob&s;erved, notwith&s;tanding the agitation he &s;uffered. a per&s;on cro&s;s the chamber, whom he immediately knew to be the &s;ame that had pa&s;&s;ed him in the avenue of the inqui&s;ition on a formernight, and whom he had then fancied to be the my&s;terious &s;tranger of Paluzzi. Vivaldi now fixed his eyes upon him, but his own peculiar &s;ituation prevented his fee|ling the intere&s;t he had formerly &s;uffered concerning him.</P>
<P>The figure, air, and &s;talk, of this per&s;on were &s;tri|king, and &s;o &s;trongly re&s;embled tho&s;e of the monk of Paluzzi, that Vivaldi had no longer a doubt as to their identity. He pointed him out to one of the officials, and enquired who he was. While he &s;poke, the &s;tran|ger was pa&s;&s;ing forward, and, before any reply was given, a door leading to the farther vaults &s;hut him from veiw. Vivaldi, however, repeated the inquiry which the official appeared unable to an&s;wer, and a re|proof from the tribunal reminded him that he mu&s;t not a&s;k que&s;tions there. Vivaldi ob&s;erved it was the grand Inqui&s;itor who &s;poke, and that the manner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the official immediately changed,</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="032735_0439_0FF497B375F23228">
The familiars, who were the &s;ame that had con|ducted Vivaldi into the chamber, having made ready the in&s;trument of torture, approached him, and after taking off his cloak and ve&s;t, bound him with &s;trong cords. They threw over his head the cu&s;tomary black garment, which entirely enveloped his figure, and prevented his ob&s;erving what was farther prepar|ing. In this &s;tate of expectation, he was again in|terrogated by the inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>"Was you ever in the church of the Spirito Santo at Naples?" &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Did you ever expre&s;s there, a contempt for the Catholic faith?"</P>
<P>"Never," &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Neither by word or action?" continued the in|qui&s;itor.</P>
<P>"Never, by either!"</P>
<P>"Recollect your&s;elf," added the inqui&s;itor. "Did you never in&s;ult there, a mini&s;ter of our mo&s;t holy church?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi was &s;ilent: he began to perceive the real nature of the charge which was to be urged again&s;t him, and that it was too plau&s;ible to permit his e&s;cape from the puni&s;hment, which is adjudged for here&s;y. Que&s;tions &s;o direct and minute had never been put to him here on his former examinations; they had been re&s;erved for a moment when it was believed he could not evade them; and the real charge had been conceal|ed from him, that he might not be prepared to elude it.</P>
<P>"An&s;wer," repeated the inqui&s;itor.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Did you ever in&s;ult a mini&s;ter of the Catholic faith, in the church of the Spirito Santo, at Naples?"</P>
<P>"Did you not in&s;ult him while he was performing an act of holy penance?" &s;aid another voice.</P>
<P>Vivaldi &s;tarted, for he in&s;tantly recollected the well|known
<PB N="150" REF="032735_0440_0FF4981B3A12DDF8">
tones of the monk of Paluzzi. "Who a&s;ks the que&s;tion?" demanded Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"It is you who are to an&s;wer here," re&s;umed the inqui&s;itor. "An&s;wer to what I have required."</P>
<P>"I have offended a mini&s;ter of the church," replied Vivaldi, "but never could intentionally in&s;ult our ho|ly religion. You are not acquainted, fathers, with the injuries that provoked&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Enough!" interrupted the inqui&s;itor; "&s;peak to the que&s;tion. Did you not, by in&s;ult and menace, force a pious brother to leave unperformed, the act of penance in which he had engaged him&s;elf? Did you not compel him to quit the church, and fly for refuge to his convent?"</P>
<P>"No," replied Vivaldi. "Tis true, he left the church, and that in con&s;equence of my conduct there; but the con&s;equence was not nece&s;&s;ary; if he had only replied to my enquiry, or promi&s;ed to re&s;tore her, of whom he had treacherou&s;ly robbed me, he might have remained quietly in the church till this moment, had that depended upon my forbearance."</P>
<P>"What!" &s;aid the vicar-general, "would you have compelled him to &s;peak, when he was engaged in &s;i|lent penance? You confe&s;s, that you occa&s;ioned him to leave the church. That is enough."</P>
<P>"Where did you fir&s;t &s;ee Ellena di Ro&s;alba?" &s;aid the voice which had &s;poken once before.</P>
<P>"I demand again, who gives the que&s;tion," an&s;wer|ed Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Recollect your&s;elf," &s;aid the inqui&s;itor, "a cri|minal cannot make a demand."</P>
<P>"I do not perceive the connection between your admonition and your a&s;&s;ertion," ob&s;erved Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"You appear to be rather too much at your ea&s;e," &s;aid the inqui&s;itor. "An&s;wer to the que&s;tion which was la&s;t put to you, or the familiars &s;hall do their du|ty."</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="032735_0441_0FF49872DFE22BA0">
"Let the &s;ame per&s;on a&s;k it," replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion was repeated in the former voice,</P>

<P>"Whence come the&s;e que&s;tions?" demanded the vicar general. "Who has been authori&s;ed thus to interrogate the pri&s;oner?"</P>
<P>No reply was made. A bu&s;y hum of voices from the tribunal &s;ucceeded the &s;ilence. At length the murmuring &s;ub&s;ided, and the monk's voice was heard again.</P>
<P>"I will declare thus much," it &s;aid, addre&s;&s;ing Vivaldi; "I am not father Schedoni."</P>
<P>The peculiar tone and empha&s;is, with which this was delivered, more than the a&s;&s;ertion it&s;elf, per&s;uad|ed Vivaldi that the &s;tranger &s;poke truth; and, though he &s;till recognized the voice of the monk of Paluzzi, he did not know it to be that of Sche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oni. Vivaldi was a&s;toni&s;hed! He would have torn the veil from his eyes, and once more viewed the my&s;terious &s;tran|ger, had his hands been at liberty. As it was, he could only conjure him to reveal his name, and the motives for his former conduct.</P>
<P>"Who is come among us?" &s;aid the vicar general, in the voice of a per&s;on who means to in&s;pire in others the awe he him&s;elf &s;uffers.</P>
<P>"Who is come among&s;t us?" he repeated in a loud|er tone. Still no an&s;wer was returned; but again a confu&s;ed murmur &s;ounded from the tribunal, and a ge|neral con&s;ternation &s;eemed to prevail. No per&s;on &s;poke with &s;ufficient pre-eminence to be under&s;tood by Vivaldi; &s;omething extraordinary appeared to be pa&s;&s;ing, and he awaited the i&s;&s;ue with all the patience he could command. Soon after he heard doors open|ed, and the noi&s;e of per&s;ons quitting the chamber. A deep &s;ilence followed; but he was certain that the
<PB N="153" REF="032735_0443_0FF4987466947318">
familiars were &s;till be&s;ide him, waiting to begin their work of torture.</P>
<P>After a con&s;iderable time had elap&s;ed, Vivaldi heard foot&s;teps advancing, and a per&s;on give orders for his relea&s;e, that he might be carried back to his cell.</P>
<P>When the veil was removed from his eyes, he per|ceived that the tribunal was di&s;&s;olved, and that the &s;tranger was gone. The lamps were dying away, and the chamber appeared more gloomily terrific than be|fore.</P>
<P>The familiars conducted him to the &s;pot at which they had received him; whence the officers who had led him thither, guarded him to his pri&s;on. There, &s;tretched upon his bed of &s;traw, in &s;olitude and in darkne&s;s, he had lei&s;ure enough to reflect upon what had pa&s;&s;ed, and to recollect with minute exactne&s;s e|very former circum&s;tance connected with the &s;tranger. By comparing tho&s;e with the pre&s;ent, he endeavoured to draw a more certain conclu&s;ion as to the identity of this per&s;on, and his motives for the very extraordi|nary conduct he had pur&s;ued, The fir&s;t appearance of this &s;tranger, among the ruins of Paluzzi, when he had &s;aid that Vivaldi's &s;teps were watched, and had cauti|oned him again&s;t returning to the villa Altieri, was recalled to his mind. Vivaldi re-con&s;idered, al&s;o, his &s;econd appearance on the &s;ame &s;pot, and his &s;econd warning; the circum&s;tances, which had attended his own adventures within the fortre&s;s;&mdash;the monk's prediction of Bianchi's death, and his evil tidings re&s;pecting Ellena, at the very hour when &s;he had been &s;eized and carried from her home. The longer he con&s;idered the&s;e &s;everal in&s;tances, as they were now connected in his mind, with the certainty of Schedoni's evil di&s;po&s;ition towards him, the more he was inclined to believe, notwith&s;tanding the voice of &s;eeming truth which had ju&s;t affirmed the contrary, that the unknown per&s;on was Schedoni him&s;elf, and
<PB N="154" REF="032735_0444_0FF4981E4B73D2E0">
that he had been employed by the Marche&s;a, to pre|vent Vivaldi's vi&s;its to the villa Altieri. Being thus an agent in the events of which he had warned Vival|di, he was too well enabled to predict them, Vival|di pau&s;ed upon the remembrance of Signora Bianchi's death; he con&s;idered the extraordinary and dubious circum&s;tances that had attended it, and &s;huddered as a new conjecture cro&s;&s;ed his mind&mdash;The thought was too dreadful to be permitted, and he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed it in&s;tantly.</P>
<P>Of the conver&s;ation, however, which he had after|wards held with the Confe&s;&s;or in the Marche&s;a's ca|binet, he recollected many particulars that &s;erved to renew his doubts as to the identity of the Stranger; the behaviour of Schedoni when he was obliquely chal|lenged for the monk of Paluzzi, &s;till appeared that of a man uncon&s;cious of di&s;gui&s;e; and above all, Vi|valdi was &s;truck with the &s;eeming candour of his hav|ing pointed out a circum&s;tance, which removed the probability that the &s;tranger was a brother of the <HI>San|ta della Pianto.</HI></P>
<P>Some particulars, al&s;o, of the &s;tranger's conduct did not agree with what might have been expected from Schedoni, even though the Confe&s;&s;or had really been Vivaldi's enemy; a circum&s;tance which the latter was no longer permitted to doubt. Nor did tho&s;e parti|cular circum&s;tances accord, as he was inclined to be|lieve, with the manner of a being of this world; and when Vivaldi con&s;idered the &s;uddenne&s;s and my&s;tery, with which the &s;tranger had always appeared and re|tired, he felt di&s;po&s;ed to adopt again one of his earlie&s;t conjectures, which undoubtedly the horrors of his pre|&s;ent abode di&s;po&s;ed his imagination to admit, as tho&s;e of his former &s;ituation in the vaults of Paluzzi, toge|ther with a youthful glow of curio&s;ity concerning the marvellous, had before contributed to impre&s;s them upon his mind.</P>
<P>He concluded his pre&s;ent reflections as he had began
<PB N="155" REF="032735_0445_0FF49875EEA25AC0">
them&mdash;in doubt and perplexity; but at length found a re&s;pite from thought and from &s;uffering in &s;leep.</P>
<P>Midnight had been pa&s;&s;ed in the vaults of the In|qui&s;ition: but it was probably not yet two o'clock, when he was imperfectly awakened by a &s;ound, which he fancied proceeded from within his chamber. He rai&s;ed him&s;elf to di&s;cover what had occa&s;ioned the noi&s;e; it was, however, impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cern any object, for all was dark, but he li&s;tened for a return of the &s;ound. The wind only was heard moaning among the inner buildings of the pri&s;on, and Vivaldi concluded, that his dream had mocked him with a mimic voice,</P>
<P>Satisfied with this conclu&s;ion, he again laid his head on his pillow of &s;traw, and &s;oon &s;unk in|to a &s;lumber. The &s;ubject of his waking thoughts &s;till haunted his imagination, and the &s;tranger, who&s;e voice he had this night recognized as that of the monk of Paluzzi, appeared before him. Vivaldi, on per|ceiving the figure of this unknown, felt, perhaps, near|ly the &s;ame degrees of awe, curio&s;ity, and impatience that he would have &s;uffered, had he beheld the &s;ub|&s;tance of the &s;hadow. The monk, who&s;e face was &s;till &s;hrowded, he thought advanced, till, having come within a few paces of Vivaldi, he pau&s;ed, and lifting the awful cowl that had hitherto concealed him, di&s;|clo&s;ed&mdash;not the countenance of Schedoni, but one of which Vivaldi did not recollect ever having &s;een be|fore! It was not le&s;s intere&s;ting to curio&s;ity, than &s;triking to the feelings. Vivaldi at the fir&s;t glance &s;hrunk back;&mdash;&s;omething of that &s;trange and inde|&s;cribable air, which we attach to the idea of a &s;uperna|tural being, prevailed over the features; and the in|ten&s;e and fiery eyes re&s;embled tho&s;e of an evil &s;pirit, ra|ther than of a human character. He drew a poig|nard from beneath a fold of his garment, and, as he di&s;played, it, pointed with a &s;tern frown to the &s;pots which di&s;coloured the blade; Vivaldi perceived they
<PB N="156" REF="032735_0446_0FF4981FD0ABC6C8">
were of blood! He turned away his eyes in horror and, when he again looked round in his dream the fi|gure was gone.</P>
<P>A groan awakened him but what were his feelings, when on looking up, he perceived the &s;ame figure &s;tanding before him! It was not, however, immedi|ately that he could convince him&s;elf the appearance was more than the phantom of his dream, &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed upon an alarmed fancy. The voice of the monk, for his face was as u&s;ual concealed; recalled Vivaldi from his error; but his emotion cannot ea&s;ily be conceived, when the &s;tranger, &s;lowly lifting that my&s;terious cowl, di&s;covered to him the &s;ame awful countenance, which had characterized the vi&s;ion i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> his &s;lumber. Unable to inquire the occa&s;ion of this appearance, Vivaldi gazed in a&s;toni&s;hment and terror, and did not immediately ob&s;erve, that, in&s;tead of a dag|ger, the monk held a lamp, which gleamed over every deep furrow of his features, yet left their &s;hadow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> markings to hint the pa&s;&s;ions and the hi&s;tory of an extraordinary life.</P>
<P>"You are &s;pared for this night," &s;aid the &s;tranger, "but for to-morrow"&mdash;he pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>"In the name of all that is mo&s;t &s;acred," &s;aid Vi|valdi, endeavouring to recollect his thoughts, "who are you, what is your errand?"</P>
<P>"A&s;k no que&s;tions," replied the monk, &s;olemnly;&mdash;"but an&s;wer <HI>me.</HI>"</P>
<P>Vivaldi was &s;truck by the tone, with which he &s;aid this, and dared not to urge the inquiry at the pre&s;ent moment.</P>
<P>"How long have you known father Schedoni?" continued the &s;tranger, "Where did you fir&s;t meet?"</P>
<P>"I have known him about a year, as my mother's confe&s;&s;or," replied Vivaldi "I fir&s;t &s;aw him from a corridor of the Vivaldi palace it was evening, and he was returning from the Marche&s;a's clo&s;et."</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="032735_0447_0FF4987FAD32A208">
"Are you certain as to this?" &s;aid the monk with peculiar empha&s;is. "It is of con&s;equence that you &s;hould be &s;o."</P>
<P>"I am certain," repeated Vivaldi,</P>
<P>"It is &s;trange," ob&s;erved the monk, after a pau&s;e, "that a circum&s;tance, which mu&s;t have appeared tri|vial to you at the moment, &s;hould have left &s;o &s;trong a mark on your memory! In two years we have time to forget many things!" He &s;ighed as he &s;poke.</P>
<P>"I remember the circum&s;tance," &s;aid Vivaldi, "be|cau&s;e I was &s;truck with his appearance; the evening was far advanced&mdash;it was du&s;k, and he came upon me &s;uddenly. His voice &s;tartled me; as he pa&s;&s;ed he &s;aid to him&s;elf&mdash;"It is for ve&s;pers." At the &s;ame time I heard the bell of the Spirito Santo.</P>
<P>"Do yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> know who he is?" &s;aid the &s;tranger, &s;o|lemnly.</P>
<P>I "know only what he appears to be," replied Vi|valdi.</P>
<P>"Did you never hear any report of his pa&s;t life?"</P>
<P>"Never," an&s;wered Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Never any thing extraordinary concerning him?" added the monk.</P>
<P>Vivaldi pau&s;ed a moment; for he now recollected the ob&s;cure and imperfect &s;tory, which Paulo had re|lated while they were confined in the dungeon of Pa|luzzi, re&s;pecting a confe&s;&s;ion made in the church of the Black Penitents; but he could not pre&s;ume to af|firm that it concerned Schedoni. He remembered al|&s;o the monk's garments &s;tained with blood, which he had di&s;covered in the vaults of that fort. The con|duct of the my&s;terious being, who now &s;tood before him, with many other particulars of his own adven|tures there, pa&s;&s;ed like a vi&s;ion over his memory. His mind re&s;embled the gla&s;s of a magician, on which the apparitions of long buried events ari&s;e, and as they fleet away, point portentiou&s;ly to &s;hapes half hid in
<PB N="158" REF="032735_0448_0FF49829A9A03C18">
the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;kine&s;s of futurity. An unu&s;ual dread &s;eized upon him; and a &s;uper&s;tition, &s;uch as he had never before admitted in an equal degree, u&s;urped his judg|ment. He looked up to the &s;hadowy countenance of the &s;tranger; and almo&s;t believed he beheld an inha|bitant of the world of &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The monk &s;poke again, repeating in a &s;everer tone, "Did you never hear any thing extraordinary con|cerning father Schedoni?"</P>
<P>"Is it rea&s;onable," &s;aid Vivaldi, recollecting his courage, "that I &s;hould an&s;wer the que&s;tions, the mi|nute que&s;tions of a per&s;on who refu&s;es to tell me even his name?</P>
<P>"My name is pa&s;&s;ed away&mdash;it is no more remem|bered," replied the &s;tranger, turning from Vivaldi,&mdash;"I leave you to your fate."</P>
<P>"What fate?" a&s;ked Vivaldi," and what is the purpo&s;e of this vi&s;it? I conjure you in the tremendous name of the Inqui&s;ition, to &s;ay!"</P>
<P>"Yo! will know full &s;oon; have mercy on your|&s;elf!"</P>
<P>"What fate?" repeated Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Uurge me no further," &s;aid the &s;tranger; "but an&s;wer to what I &s;hall demand. Schedoni&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I have told you all that I certainly know con|cerning him," interrupted Vivaldi, the re&s;t is only conjecture."</P>
<P>"What is that conjecture? Does it relate to a con|fe&s;&s;ion made in the church of the Black Penitents of the Santa Maria del Pianto?</P>
<P>"It does!" replied Vivaldi with &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>"What was that confe&s;&s;ion?"</P>
<P>"I know not," an&s;wered Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Declare the truth," &s;aid the &s;tranger, &s;ternly.</P>
<P>"A confe&s;&s;ion," replied Vivaldi, "is &s;acred, and forever buried in the bo&s;om of the prie&s;t to whom it
<PB N="159" REF="032735_0449_0FF49881337EA9B8">
is made. How then, is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that I can be acquainted with the &s;ubject of this?"</P>
<P>"Did you never hear, that father Schedoni had been guilty of &s;ome great crimes, which he endeavours to era&s;e from his con&s;cience by the &s;everity of pen|ance?</P>
<P>"Never! &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Did you never hear that he had a wife&mdash;a bro|ther?"</P>
<P>"Never!"</P>
<P>"Nor the means he u&s;ed&mdash;no hint of&mdash;murder, of"&mdash;</P>
<P>"The &s;tranger pau&s;ed, as if he wi&s;hed Vivaldi to fill up his meaning. Vivaldi was &s;ilent and agha&s;t.</P>
<P>"You known nothing then, of Schedoni," re&s;um|ed the monk after a deep pau&s;e&mdash;"nothing of his pa&s;t life?"</P>
<P>"Nothing, except what I have mentioned," replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Then li&s;ten to what I &s;hall unfold!" continued the monk, with &s;olemnity. To morrow night you will be again carried to the place of torture; you will be taken to a chamber beyond that in which you were this night. You will there witne&s;s many extraordi|nary things, of which you have not now any &s;u&s;picion. Be not di&s;mayed; I &s;hall be there, though, perhaps, not vi&s;ible."</P>
<P>"Not vi&s;ible!" exclaimed Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Interrupt me not, but li&s;ten.&mdash;When you are a&s;|ked of father Schdoni, &s;ay&mdash;that he has lived for fifteen years in the di&s;gui&s;e of a monk, a member of the Do|minicans of the Sprito Santo, at Naples. When you are a&s;ked who he is, reply&mdash;Fernando Count di Bruon. You will be a&s;ked the motive for &s;uch di&s;gui&s;e. In reply to this, refer them to the <HI>Black Penitents</HI> of the Santa Maria del Pianto, near that city; bid the inqui|&s;itors &s;ummon before their tribunal one father An&s;aldo

di Rovalli, the grand penitentiary of the &s;ociety, and command him to divulge the crimes confe&s;&s;ed to him in the year 1752, on the evening of the twenty-fourth of April, which was then the vigil of Santo Marco in a confe&s;&s;ional of the Santo del Pianto,"</P>
<P>"It is probable he may have forgotten &s;uch confe&s;&s;i|on, at this di&s;tance of time," ob&s;erved Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Fear not but he will remember," replied the &s;tranger.</P>
<P>"But will his con&s;cience &s;uffer him to betray the &s;ecrets of a confe&s;&s;ion?" &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"The tribunal command, and his con&s;cience is ab|&s;olved," an&s;wered the monk. "He may not refu&s;e to obey! You are further to direct your examiners to &s;ummon father Schedoni, to an&s;wer for the crimes which An&s;aldo &s;hall reveal." The monk pau&s;ed, and &s;eemed waiting the reply of Vivaldi, who after a mo|mentary con&s;ideration, &s;aid.</P>
<P>"How can I do all this, and upon the in&s;tigation of a &s;tranger! Neither con&s;cience nor prudence will &s;uf|fer me to a&s;&s;ert what I cannot prove is true, that I have rea&s;on to beleive Schedoni is my bitter enemy, but I will not be unju&s;t even to him. I have no proof that he is the Count di Bruno, nor that he is the perpetrator of the crimes you allude to, whatever tho&s;e may be; and I will not be made an in&s;trument to &s;ummon any man before a tribunal, where innocence is no protection from ignominy, and where &s;u&s;picion alone may inflict death."</P>
<P>"You doubt, then, the truth of what I a&s;&s;ert?" &s;aid the monk, in a haughty tone.</P>
<P>"Can I believe that of which I have no proof?" replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Yes, there are ca&s;es which do not admit of proof; under your peculiar circum&s;tances, this is one of them; you can act only upon a&s;&s;ertion. I atte&s;t," continu|ed the monk, rai&s;ing his hollow voice to a tone of &s;in|gular &s;olemnity, "I atte&s;t the powers which are be|yond

this earth, to witne&s;s to the truth of what I have delivered!"</P>
<P>As the &s;tranger uttered this adjuration, Vivaldi ob&s;erved, with emotion, the extraordinary expre&s;&s;ion, of his eyes; Vivaldi's pre&s;ence of mind, however, did not for&s;ake him, and, in the next moment, he &s;aid, "But who is he that thus atte&s;ts? It is upon the a&s;&s;er|tion of a &s;tranger that I am to rely, in defect of proof! It is a &s;tranger who calls upon me to bring &s;olemn charges again&s;t a man, of who&s;e guilt I know noth|ing!</P>
<P>"You are not required to bring charges; you are only to &s;ummon him who will."</P>
<P>"I &s;hould &s;till a&s;&s;i&s;t in bringing forward accu&s;a|tions, which may be founded in error," replied Vival|di. "If you are convinced of their truth, why do you not &s;ummon An&s;aldo your&s;elf?"</P>
<P>"I &s;hall do more," &s;aid the monk.</P>
<P>"But why not &s;ummon al&s;o?" urged Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall appear," &s;aid the &s;tranger, with empha&s;is.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, though &s;omewhat awed by the manner, which accompanied the&s;e words, &s;till urged his in|quiries, "As a witne&s;s! &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"Aye, as a dreadful witne&s;s!" replied the monk.</P>
<P>"But may not a witne&s;s &s;ummon others before the tribunal of the inqui&s;ition?" continued Vivaldi faul|teringly.</P>
<P>"He may," &s;aid the &s;tranger.</P>
<P>"Why when," ob&s;erved Vivaldi," am I, a &s;trang|er to you, called upon to do that which you could per|form your&s;elf?"</P>
<P>"A&s;k no further," &s;aid the monk, "but an&s;wer, whether you will deliver the &s;ummons?"</P>
<P>"The charges which mu&s;t follow," replied Vi|valdi, "appears to be of a nature too &s;olemn to ju&s;ti|fy my promoting them. I re&s;ign the ta&s;k to you."</P>
<P>"When I &s;ummon," &s;aid the &s;tranger, "you &s;hall obey!"</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="032735_0452_0FF4982CB7649E48">
Vivaldi, again awed by his, manner, again ju&s;tified his refu&s;al, and concluded with repeating his &s;urprize, that he &s;hould be required to a&s;&s;i&s;t in his my&s;terious affair, "Since I neither know you, father," he added, "nor the Penitentiary An&s;aldo, whom you bid me ad|moni&s;h to appear."</P>
<P>"You &s;hall know me hereafter," &s;aid the &s;tranger, frowningly; and he drew from beneath his garment a dagger!</P>
<P>Vivaldi remembered his dream.</P>
<P>"Mark tho&s;e &s;pots," &s;aid the Monk.</P>
<P>Vivaldi looked, and beheld blood!</P>
<P>"This blood, added the &s;tranger, pointing to the blade, "would have &s;aved your's! Here is &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of truth! To-morrow night you will meet me in the chambers of death!"</P>
<P>As he &s;poke, he turned away; and, before Vivaldi had recovered from his con&s;ternation, the light di&s;ap|peared. Vivaldi knew that the &s;tranger had quitte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the pri&s;on; only by the &s;ilence which prevailed there.</P>
<P>He remained &s;unk in thought, till, at the dawn o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> day, the man on watch, unfa&s;tened the door of his cell, and brought as u&s;ual a jug of water, and &s;ome bread. Vivaldi inquired the name of the &s;tranger who had vi&s;ited him in the night. The centinel looked &s;ur|pri&s;ed, and Vivaldi repeated the que&s;tion before he could obtain an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>"I have been on guard &s;ince the fir&s;t hour,&punc; &s;aid the man, and no per&s;on, in that time, has pa&s;&s;ed through this door!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi regarded the centinel with attention, while he made this a&s;&s;ertion, and did not receive in his man|ner any con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of fal&s;ehood; yet he knew not how to believe what he had affirmed. "Did you hear no noi&s;e, either?" &s;aid Vivaldi. "Has all been &s;ilent during the night?"</P>
<P>"I have heard only the bell of San Dominico &s;trike

upon the hour," replied the man, "and the watch word of the centinels."</P>
<P>"This is incomprehen&s;ible!" exclaimed Vivaldi, "What! no foot&s;teps, no voice?"</P>
<P>The man &s;miled contemptuou&s;ly. "None, but of the centinels," he replied.</P>
<P>"How can you be certain you heard only the centi|nels, friend?" added Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"They &s;peak only to pa&s;s the watch word, and the cla&s;h of their arms is heard at the &s;ame time."</P>
<P>"But their foot&s;teps!&mdash;how are they di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e of other per&s;ons?"</P>
<P>"By the heavine&s;s of their tread; our &s;andals are braced with iron. But why the&s;e que&s;tions, Signor?"</P>
<P>"You have kept guard at the door of this cham|ber?" &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Yes, Signor."</P>
<P>"And you have not once heard, during the whole night, a voice from within it?"</P>
<P>"None, Signor."</P>
<P>"Fear nothing from di&s;covery, friend; confe&s;s that you have &s;lumbered."</P>
<P>"I had a comrade," replied the centinel, angrily, "has he, too, &s;lumbered! and if he had, how could admittance be obtained without our keys?"</P>
<P>And tho&s;e might ea&s;ily have been procured, friend; if you were overcome with &s;leep. You may rely upon my promi&s;e of &s;ecrecy."</P>
<P>"What! &s;aid the man, "have I kept guard for three years in the inqui&s;ition, to be &s;u&s;pected, by a he|retic, of neglecting my duty?"</P>
<P>"If you were &s;u&s;pected by an heretic" replied Vi|valdi, "you ought to con&s;ole your&s;elf by recollecting that his opinions are con&s;idered to be erroneous.</P>
<P>"We were watchful every minute of the night," &s;aid the centinel, going.</P>
<P>"This is incomprehen&s;ible!" &s;aid Vivaldi. "By

what means could the &s;tranger have entered my pri|&s;on?"</P>
<P>"Signor, you &s;till dream!" replied the centinel, pau&s;ing. "No per&s;on has been here."</P>
<P><HI>"Still</HI> dream!" repeated Vivaldi, "how do you know that I have dream<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> at all?" His mind deeply affected by the extraordinary circum&s;tances of the dream, and the yet more extraordinary incident that had followed, Vivaldi gave a meaning to the words of the centinel, which did not belong to them.</P>
<P>"When people &s;leep, they are apt to dream," re|plied the man, dryly. "I &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>you</HI> had &s;lept, Sig|nor."</P>
<P>"A per&s;on, habited&punc; like a monk, came to me in the night," re&s;umed Vivaldi, "and he de&s;cribed the ap|pearance of the &s;tranger. The centinel, while he li&s;|tened, became grave and thoughtful."</P>
<P>"Do you know any per&s;on re&s;embling the one I have mentioned?" &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"No!" replied the guard.</P>
<P>"Though you have not &s;een him enter my pri&s;on," continued Vivaldi, "you may, perhaps, recollect &s;uch a per&s;on, as an inhabitant of the Inqui&s;ition."</P>
<P>"San Dominico forbid!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi, &s;urpri&s;ed at this exclamation, inquired the rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>"I know him not," replied the centinel, changing countenance, and abruptly left the pri&s;on. Whatever con&s;ideration might occa&s;ion this &s;udden departure, his a&s;&s;ertion that he had been for three years a guard of the inqui&s;ition could &s;carcely be credited, &s;ince he had held &s;o long a dialogue with the pri&s;oner, and was, apparently, in&s;en&s;ible of the danger he incurred by &s;o doing.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AT about the &s;ame hour, as on the preceeding night, Vivaldi heard per&s;ons approaching his pri&s;on, and, the door unfolding, his former conductors appear|ed. They threw over him the &s;ame mantle as before, and in addition, a black veil, that completely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his eyes; after which, they led him from the chamber. Vivaldi heard the door &s;hut, on his depar|ture, and the centinels followed his &s;teps, as if their du|ty was fini&s;hed, and he was to return thither no more. At this moment, he remembered the words of the &s;tranger, when he had di&s;played the poignard, and Vi|valdi apprehended the wor&s;t, from having thwarted the de&s;igns of a per&s;on apparently &s;o malignant; but he exulted in the rectitude, which had pre&s;erved him from deba&s;ement; and, with the magnanimous enthu|&s;ia&s;m of virtue, he almo&s;t welcomed &s;ufferings, which would prove the firmne&s;s of his ju&s;tice towards an ene|my; for he determined to brave every thing, rather than impute to Schedoni circum&s;tances, the truth of which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no means of a&s;certaining.</P>
<P>While Vivaldi was conducted, as on the preceeding night, through many pa&s;&s;ages, he endeavoured to di&s;|cover, by their length, and the abruptne&s;s of their tur|nings, whether they where the &s;ame he had traver&s;ed before. Suddenly, one of his conductors cried 'Steps!' It was the fir&s;t word Vivaldi had ever heard him utter immediately perceived that the ground &s;unk, and, he began to de&s;cend; as he did whch, he tried to count,
<PB N="166" REF="032735_0456_0FF498374161FD18">
the number of &s;teps, that he might form &s;ome judg|ment whether this was the flight he had pa&s;&s;ed before. When he had reached the bottom, he inclined to believe it was not &s;o; and the care which had been ob&s;erved i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> blinding him, &s;eemed to indicate that he was going <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome new place.</P>
<P>He pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal avenues, and then a&s;cen|ded; &s;oon after which, he again de&s;cended a very long &s;tair-ca&s;e, &s;uch as he had not a remembrance of, and they pa&s;&s;ed over a con&s;iderable extent of level ground. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the hollow &s;ounds which his &s;teps returned, he judged that he was walking over vaults. The foot&s;teps of the centinels who had followed from the cell were no lon|ger heard, and he &s;eemed to be left with his conductor only. A &s;econd flight appeared to lead him into &s;ub|terraneous vaults, for he perceived the air change, and felt a damp vapour wrapt round him. The menace of the monk, that he &s;hould meet him in the chambers of death, frequently occurred to Vivaldi.</P>
<P>His conductors &s;topped in this vault, and &s;eemed to hold a con&s;ultation, but they &s;poke in &s;uch low accents, that their words were not di&s;tingui&s;hable, except a few unconnected ones, that hinted of more than Vivaldi could comprehended. He was, at length, again led for|ward; and &s;oon after, he heard the heavy grating of hinges, and perceived that he was pa&s;&s;ing through &s;ev|eral doors, by the &s;ituation of which Vivaldi judge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> they were the &s;ame he had entered the night before, and concluded, that he was going to the hall of the tribunal.</P>
<P>His conductors &s;topped again, and Vivaldi heard the iron <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">od &s;trike three times upon a door; immedi|ately a &s;trange voice &s;poke from within, and the door unclo&s;ed. Vivaldi pa&s;&s;ed on, and imagined that he was admitted into a &s;pacious vault; for the air was free|er, and his &s;teps &s;ounded to a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently a voice, as on the preceeding night, &s;um|moned
<PB N="167" REF="032735_0457_0FF49890CD422E28">
him to come forward, and Vivaldi under&s;tood that he was again before the tribunal. It was the voice of the inqui&s;itor who had been his chief examiner.</P>
<P>"You, Vincentio di Vivaldi," it &s;aid, "an&s;wer to your name, and to the que&s;tions which &s;hall be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to you, without equivocation, on pain of the torture."</P>
<P>As the monk had predicted, Vivaldi was a&s;ked what he knew of father Schedoni, and, when he replied, as he had formerly done to his my&s;terious vi&s;itor, he was told that he knew more than he acknowledged.</P>
<P>"I <HI>know</HI> no more," replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"You equivocate," &s;aid the inqui&s;itor. "Declare what you have heard, and remember that you for|merly took an oath to that purpo&s;e."</P>
<P>Vivaldi was &s;ilent, till a tremendous voice from the tribunal commanded him to re&s;pect his oath.</P>
<P>"I do re&s;pect it," &s;aid Vivaldi; and I conjure to believe that I al&s;o re&s;pect truth, when I declare, that what I am going to relate, is a report to which I give no confidence, and concerning even the probability of which I cannot produce the &s;malle&s;t proof."</P>
<P>"Re&s;pect truth!" &s;aid another voice from the tri|bunal, and Vivaldi fancied he di&s;tingui&s;hed the tones of the monk. He pau&s;ed a moment, and the exorta|tion was repeated. Vivaldi then related what the &s;tranger had &s;aid concerning the family of Schedoni, and the di&s;gui&s;e which the father had a&s;&s;umed in the convent of the Spirito Santo; but forbore even to name the penitentiary An&s;aldo, and any circum&s;tance connected with the extraordinary confe&s;&s;ion. Vival|di concluded, with again declaring, that he had not &s;ufficient authority to ju&s;tify a belief in tho&s;e reports.</P>
<P>"On what authority do you repeat them?" &s;aid the vicar-generally.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"On what authority?" inquired the inqui&s;itor. &s;ternly.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="032735_0458_0FF49838C61D8570">
Vivaldi, after a momentary he&s;itation, &s;aid, "what I am about to declare, holy fathers, is &s;o extraordi|nary&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Tremble!" &s;aid a voice clo&s;e to his ear, which he in&s;tantly knew to be the monk's, and the &s;udden|ne&s;s of which electrified him. He was unable to conclude the &s;entence.</P>
<P>"What is your authority for the reports?" demand|ed the inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>"It is unknown, even to my&s;elf!" an&s;wered Vi|valdi.</P>
<P>"Do not equivocate!" &s;aid the vicar-general.</P>
<P>"I &s;olemnly prote&s;t," rejoined Vivaldi, "that I know not either the name or the condition of my in|former, and that I never even beheld his face, till the period when he &s;poke of father Schedoni.</P>
<P>"Tremble!' repeated the &s;ame low, but emphatic voice in his ear. Vivaldi &s;tarted, and turning involuntary towards the &s;ound, though his eyes could not a&s;&s;i&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>"You did well to &s;ay, that you had &s;omething ex|traordinary to add," ob&s;erved the inqui&s;itor. "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> evident, al&s;o, that you expected &s;omething extraordi|nary from your judges, &s;ince you &s;uppo&s;ed they would credit the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions."</P>
<P>Vivaldi was too proud to attempt the ju&s;tifying him&s;elf again&s;t &s;o gro&s;s an accu&s;ation, or to make any reply.</P>
<P>"Why do you not &s;ummon father An&s;aldo?" &s;aid the voice. "Remember my words!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi, again awed by the voice, he&s;itated, for an in&s;tant, how to act, and in that in&s;tant his courage re|turned.</P>
<P>"My infomer &s;tands be&s;ide me!" &s;aid Vivaldi boldly; "I know his voice! Detain him; it is of con|&s;equence"</P>
<P>"Who&s;e voice?" demanded the inqui&s;itor. No per&s;on &s;poke but my&s;elf!"</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="032735_0459_0FF49892530F0358">
"Who&s;e voice?" &s;aid the vicar-general.</P>
<P>"The voice was clo&s;e be&s;ide me," replied Vivaldi. "It &s;poke low but I knew it well."</P>
<P>"This is either the cunning, or the frenzy of de&s;|pair!" ob&s;erved the vicar-general.</P>
<P>"Not any per&s;on is now be&s;ide you, except the fa|miliars," &s;aid the inqui&s;itor, "and they wait to do their office, if you &s;hall refu&s;e to an&s;wer the que&s;tions put to you."</P>
<P>"I per&s;i&s;t in my a&s;&s;ertion," replied Vivaldi; "and I &s;upplicate that my eyes may be unbound, that I may know my enemy."</P>
<P>The tribunal after a long private con&s;ultation, grant|ed the reque&s;t; the veil was withdrawn, and Vivaldi perceived be&s;ide him only the familiars! Their faces, as is u&s;ual, were concealed. It appeared that one of the&s;e torturers mu&s;t be the my&s;terious enemy, who pur&s;ued him, if, indeed, that enemy was an inhabitant of the earth! and Vivaldi reque&s;ted that they might be ordered to uncover their features. He was &s;ternly rebuked for &s;o pre&s;umptuous a requi&s;ition, and remind|ed of the inviolable law and faith, which the tribunal had pledged, that per&s;ons appointed to their awful office &s;hould never be expo&s;ed to the revenge of the crimin|al, whom it might be their duty to puni&s;h.</P>
<P>"Their duty!" exclaimed Vivaldi, thrown from his guard by &s;trong indignation. "And is faith held &s;acred with demons!"</P>
<P>Without awaiting the order of the tribunal, the familiars immediately covered Vivaldi's face with the veil, and he felt him&s;elf in their gra&s;p. He endeavour|ed, however, to di&s;entangle his hands, and, at length, &s;hook the&s;e men from their hold, and again unveiled his eyes; but the familiars were in&s;tantly ordered to replace the veil.</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itor bade Vivaldi to recollect in who&s;e pre&s;ence he then was, and to dread the puni&s;hment
<PB N="170" REF="032735_0460_0FF4983A4E877798">
which his re&s;i&s;tance had incurred, and which would be inflicted without delay, unle&s;s he could give &s;ome in&s;tance, that might tend to prove the truth of his late a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>"If you expect that I &s;hould &s;ay more," replied Vi|valdi, "I claim, at lea&s;t, protection from the unbidden violence of the men who guard me. If they are &s;uf|fered, at their plea&s;ure, to &s;port with the mi&s;ery of their pri&s;oner, I will be inflexibly &s;ilent; and, &s;ince I mu&s;t &s;uffer, it &s;hall be according to the laws of the tribunal."</P>
<P>The vicar-general, or, as he is called, the grand inqui&s;itor, promi&s;ed Vivaldi the degree of protection he claimed, and demanded, at the &s;ame time, what were the words he had ju&s;t heard.</P>
<P>Vivaldi con&s;idered, that though ju&s;tice bade him avoid accu&s;ing an enemy of &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances, concerning which he had no proof, yet, that neither ju&s;tice nor common &s;en&s;e required he &s;hould make a &s;acrafice of him&s;elf to the dilemma in which he was placed: he, therefore, without further &s;cruple, ac|knowledged, that the voice had bidden him require of the tribunal to &s;ummon one father An&s;aldo, the grand penitentiary of the Santa del Pianto, near Naples, and al&s;o father Schedoni, who was to an&s;wer to extraordi|nary charges, which would be brought again&s;t him by An&s;aldo. Vivaldi anxiou&s;ly and repeatedly de|clared, that he knew not the nature of the charges, nor that any ju&s;t grounds for them exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>The&s;e a&s;&s;ertions &s;eemed to throw the tribunal into new perplexity. Vivaldi heard their bu&s;y voices in low debate, which continued for a con&s;iderable time. In this interval he had lei&s;ure to perceive the many improbabilities that either of the familiars &s;hould be the &s;tranger who &s;o my&s;teriou&s;ly haunted him; and among the&s;e was the circum&s;tance of his having re&s;ided &s;o long at Naples</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="032735_0461_0FF4989E7913F428">
The tribunal, after &s;ome had time elap&s;ed in con&s;ulta|tion, proceeded on the examination, &amp; Vivaldi was a&s;k|ed what he knew of father An&s;aldo. He immediately replied, that An&s;aldo was an utter &s;tranger to him, and that he was not even acquainted with a &s;ingle per&s;on re&s;iding in the Santa del Pianto who had any know|ledge of the penitentiary.</P>
<P>"How!" &s;aid the grand inqui&s;itor, "You forget that the per&s;on, who bade you require of this tribunal to &s;ummon An&s;aldo, has knowledge of him."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, I do not forget," replied Vivaldi; "and I reque&s;t it may be remembered that I am not acquainted with that per&s;on. If, therefore, he had given me any account of An&s;aldo, I could not have relied upon its authenticity." Vivaldi again required of the tribunal to under&s;tand that he did not &s;ummon An&s;aldo, or any other per&s;on, before them, but had merely obeyed their command to repeat what the &s;tran|ger had &s;aid.</P>
<P>The tribunal acknowledged the ju&s;tne&s;s of this in|junction and exculpated him from any harm that &s;hould be the con&s;equence of the &s;ummons. But this a&s;&s;urance of &s;afety for him&s;elf was not &s;ufficient to ap|pea&s;e Vivaldi, who was alarmed le&s;t he &s;hould be the means of bringing an innocent per&s;on under &s;u&s;picion. The grand inqui&s;itor again addre&s;&s;ed him, after a gen|eral &s;ilence had been commanded in the court.</P>
<P>"The account you have given of your informer," &s;aid he, "is &s;o extraordinary, that it would not de&s;erve credit, but that you have di&s;covered the utmo&s;t reluct|ance to reveal the charges he gave you, from which it appears, that, on your part, at lea&s;t, the &s;ummons is not malicious. But are you certain that you have not de|luded your&s;elf, and that the voice be&s;ide you was not an imaginary one, conjured up by your agitated &s;pi|rits?"</P>
<P>"I am certain," replied Vivaldi, with firmne&s;s&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="032735_0462_0FF4983BD52329D0">
"It is true," re&s;umed the grand inqui&s;itor, "that &s;everal per&s;ons were near you, when you exclaimed, that you heard the voice of your informer; yet no per&s;on heard it be&s;ides your&s;elf!"</P>
<P>"Where are tho&s;e per&s;ons now?" demanded Vi|valdi.</P>
<P>"They are di&s;per&s;ed; alarmed at your accu&s;ation."</P>
<P>"If you will &s;ummon them," &s;aid Vivaldi, "and or|der, that my eyes may be uncovered, I will point out to you, without he&s;itation, the per&s;on of my informer, &s;hould he remain among them."</P>
<P>The tribunal commanded that they &s;hould appear, but new difficulties aro&s;e. It was not remembered of whom the crowd con&s;i&s;ted, a few individuals only were recollected, and the&s;e were &s;ummoned.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, in &s;olemn expectation, heard &s;teps and the hum of voices gathering round him, and impatiently awaited for the words that would re&s;tore him to &s;ight, and, perhaps relea&s;e him from uncertainty. In a few moments he heard the command given: the veil was once more removed from his eyes, and he was order|ed to point out the accu&s;er. Vivaldi threw an ha&s;ty glance upon the &s;urrounding &s;trangers.</P>
<P>"The lights burn dimly," &s;aid he, "I cannot di&s;|tingui&s;h the&s;e faces."</P>
<P>It was ordered that a lamp &s;hould be lowered from the roof, and that the &s;trangers &s;hould arrange them|&s;elves on either &s;ide of Vivaldi. When this was done&punc; and he glanced his eyes again upon the crowd, "He is not here!" &s;aid Vivaldi; not one of the&s;e counte|nances re&s;embles the monk of Paluzzi. Yet, &s;tay&punc; who is he that &s;tands in the &s;hade behind tho&s;e per|&s;ons on the left? Bid him lift his cowl!"</P>
<P>The crowd fell back, and the per&s;on, to whom Vi|valdi had pointed, was left alone within the circle.</P>
<P>"He is an officer of the Inqui&s;ition, "&s;aid a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> near Vivaldi, "and he may not be compelled to di&s;|cover
<PB N="173" REF="032735_0463_0FF49893DA521538">
his face, unle&s;s by an expre&s;s command from the tribunal."</P>
<P>"I call upon the tribunal to command it!" &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Who calls!" exclaimed a voice, and Vivaldi re|cognized the tones of the monk, but he knew not ex|actly whence they came.</P>
<P>"I Vincentio di Vivaldi," replied the pri&s;oner, "I claim the privilege that has been awarded me, and bid you unveil your countenance."</P>
<P>There was a pau&s;e of &s;ilence in the court, except that a dull murmur ran through the tribunal&punc; Meanwhile, the figure within the circle &s;tood motionle&s;s, and re|mained veiled.</P>
<P>"Spare him," &s;aid the man, who had before addre&s;|&s;ed Vivaldi; "he has rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing to remain unknown, which you cannot conjecture. He is an of|ficer of the Inqui&s;ition, and not the per&s;on you ap|prehend.</P>
<P>"Perhaps I <HI>can</HI> conjecture his rea&s;ons," replied Vi|valdi, who, rai&s;ing his voice, added, "I appeal to this tribunal, and command you, who &s;tand alone within the circle, you in black garments, to unveil your fea|tures!"</P>
<P>Immediately a loud voice i&s;&s;ued from the tribunal, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"We command you, in the name of the mo&s;t holy Inqui&s;ition, to reveal your&s;elf!"</P>
<P>The &s;tranger trembled, but, without pre&s;uming to he&s;itate, uplifted his cowl. Vivaldi's eyes were ea|gerly fixed upon him; but the action di&s;clo&s;ed, not the countenance of the monk? but an official whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e recollected to have &s;een once before, though exact|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y on what occa&s;ion he did not now remember.</P>
<P>"This is not my informer!" &s;aid Vivaldi, turning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rom him with deep di&s;appointment, while the &s;tran|ger dropped the cowl, and the crowd clo&s;ed upon him.
<PB N="174" REF="032735_0464_0FF49844C6C7CF30">
At the a&s;&s;ertion of Vivaldi, the members of the tribu|nal looked upon each other doubtingly, and were &s;ilent, till the grand inqui&s;itor waving his hand, as if to com|mand attention, addre&s;&s;ed Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"It appears, then, that you <HI>have</HI> formerly &s;een the face of your informer!"</P>
<P>"I have already declared &s;o," replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>The grand inqui&s;itor demanded when, and where, he had &s;een it.</P>
<P>"La&s;t night, and in my pri&s;on," an&s;wered Vi|valdi.</P>
<P>"In your pri&s;on!" &s;aid the ordinary inqui&s;itor, contemptuou&s;ly, who had before examined him, "and in your dreams, too, no doubt!"</P>
<P>"In your pri&s;on!" exclaimed &s;everal members of the lower tribunal.</P>
<P>"He dreams &s;till!" ob&s;erved an inqui&s;itor. "Ho|ly fathers! he abu&s;es your patience, and the frenzy of terror has deluded his credulity. We neglect the mo|ments."</P>
<P>"We mu&s;t inquire farther into this," &s;aid another inqui&s;itor. "Here is &s;ome deception. If you, Vin|centio di Vivaldi, have a&s;&s;erted a fal&s;hood&mdash;tremble!"</P>
<P>Whether Vivaldi's memory &s;till vibrated with the voice of the monk, or that the tone in which this &s;ame word was now pronounced, did re&s;emble it, he almo&s;t &s;tarted, when the inqui&s;itor had &s;aid <HI>tremble!</HI> and he demanded who &s;poke then.</P>
<P>"It is our&s;elf," an&s;wered the inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort conver&s;ation among the members of the tribunal, the grand inqui&s;itor gave orders that the centinels, who had watched on the preceding night at the pri&s;on door of Vivaldi, &s;hould be brought into the hall of ju&s;tice. The per&s;ons, who had been lately &s;ummoned into the chamber, were now bidden to withdraw, and all further examination was &s;u&s;pended till the arrival of the centinels: Vivaldi heard only
<PB N="175" REF="032735_0465_0FF498A0039B1880">
the low voices of the inqui&s;itors, as they conver&s;ed privately together, and he remained &s;ilent, thoughtful, and amazed.</P>
<P>When the centinels appeared, and were a&s;ked who had entered the pri&s;on of Vivaldi during the la&s;t night, they declared, without he&s;itation, or confu&s;ion; that not any per&s;on had pa&s;&s;ed through the door after the hour when the pri&s;oner had returned from examina|tion, till the following morning, when the guard had carried in the u&s;ual allowance of bread and water. In this a&s;&s;ertion, they per&s;i&s;ted, without the lea&s;t equivo|cation, notwith&s;tanding which they were ordered into confinement, till the affair &s;hould be cleared up.</P>
<P>The doubts, however, which were admitted, as to the integrity of the&s;e men, did not contribute to di&s;|&s;ipate tho&s;e, which had prevailed over the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the que&s;tion. On the contrary, the &s;u&s;picions of the tribunal, augmenting with their perplexity, &s;eemed to fluctuate equally over every point of the &s;ubject before them, till, in&s;tead of throwing any light upon the truth, they only &s;erved to involve the whole in deeper ob&s;curity. More doubtful than before of the hone&s;ty of Vivaldi's extraordinary a&s;&s;ertions, the inqui&s;itor informed him, that if, after further inquiry into this affair, it &s;hould appear he had been trifling with the credulity of his judges, he would be &s;everely puni&s;hed for his audacity; but that on the other hand, &s;hould there be rea&s;on to believe that the centinels had failed in their duty, and that &s;ome per&s;on had entered his pri&s;on during the night, the tribunal would proceed in a different manner.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, perceiving that, to be believed, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be more circum&s;tantial, de&s;cribed, with exactne&s;s, the per&s;on and appearance of the monk, without, however, mentioning the poignard which had been exhibited. A profound &s;ilence reigned in the chamber while he &s;poke; it &s;eemed a &s;ilence not
<PB N="176" REF="032735_0466_0FF498465C466740">
merely of attention, but of a&s;toni&s;hment. Vivaldi him&s;elf was awed, and, when he had concluded, almo&s;t expected to hear the voice of the monk uttering defi|ance, or threatning vengeance; but all remained hu&s;hed, till the inqui&s;itor, who had fir&s;t examined him, &s;aid in a &s;olemn tone.</P>
<P>"We have li&s;tened with attention to what you have delivered, and will give the ca&s;e a full inquiry. Some points, on which you have touched, excite our amazement, and call for particular regard. Retire whence you came&mdash;and &s;leep this night without fear; <HI>you will &s;oon know more.</HI>"</P>
<P>Vivaldi was immediately led from the chamber, and &s;till blindfolded, re-conducted to the pri&s;on to which he had &s;uppo&s;ed it was de&s;igned he &s;hould return no more. When the veil was withdrawn, he perceived that his guard was changed.</P>
<P>Again left to the &s;ilence of his cell, he reviewed all that had pa&s;&s;ed in the chamber of ju&s;tice; the que&s;tions which had been put to him; the different manners of the inqui&s;itors; the occurrence of the monk's voice; and the &s;imilarity, which he had fancied he perceived between it and that of an inqui&s;itor, when the latter pronounced the word <HI>tremble;</HI> but the con&s;ideration of all the&s;e circum&s;tances did not in any degree relieve him from his perplexity. Sometimes he was inclin|ed to think that the monk was an inqui&s;itor, and the voice had more than once appeared to proceed from the tribunal; but he remembered, al&s;o, that, more than once, it had &s;poken clo&s;e to his ear, and he knew that a member of this tribu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">al might not leave his &s;tation during the examination of a pri&s;oner, and that, even if he had dared to do &s;o, his &s;ingular dre&s;s would have pointed him out to notice, and con&s;equently to &s;u&s;pi|cion, at the moment when Vivaldi had exclaimed, that he heard the voice of his informer.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, however, could not avoid meditating, with
<PB N="177" REF="032735_0467_0FF498A188AD9E60">
&s;urprize, on the la&s;t words which the inqui&s;itor, who had been his chief examiner, had addre&s;&s;ed to him, when he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from before the tribunal. The&s;e were the more &s;urprizing, becau&s;e they were the fir&s;t from him that had in any degree indicated a wi&s;h to con&s;ole or quiet the alarm of the pri&s;oner; and Vivaldi even fancied that they betrayed &s;ome fore|knowledge that he would not be di&s;turbed this night by the pre&s;ence of his awful vi&s;itor. He would en|tirely have cea&s;ed to apprehend, though not to expect, had he been allowed a light, and any weapon of de|fence, if, in truth, the &s;tranger was of a nature to fear a weapon; but, to be thus expo&s;ed to the de&s;igns of a my&s;terious and powerful being, whom he was con|&s;cious of having offended, to &s;u&s;tain &s;uch a &s;ituation, without fuffering anxiety, required &s;omewhat more than courage, or le&s;s than rea&s;on.</P>

<P>IN con&s;equence of what had tran&s;pired at the la&s;t examination of Vivaldi, the grand penitentiary An&s;al|do, together with the father Schedoni, were cited to appear before the table of the holy office.</P>
<P>Schedoni was arre&s;ted on his way to Rome, whi|ther he was going privately to make further efforts for the liberation of Vivaldi, who&s;e relea&s;e he had found it more difficult to effect, than his impri&s;onment; the per&s;on upon who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance the Confe&s;&s;or relied in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, having boa&s;ted of more influence than he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or perhaps thought it prudent to ex|ert. Schedoni had been the more anxious to pro|cure an immediate relea&s;e for Vivaldi, le&s;t a report of his &s;ituation &s;hould reach his family, notwith&s;tanding the precautions, which are u&s;ually employed to throw an impenetrable &s;hrowd over the pri&s;oners of this dreadful tribunal, and bury them for ever from the knowledge of their friends. Such premature di&s;cove|ry of Vivaldi's circum&s;tances, Schedoni apprehended might include al&s;o a di&s;covery of the per&s;ecutor, and draw down upon him&s;elf the abhorrence and the ven|geance of a family, whom it was now, more than ever, his wi&s;h and his intere&s;t to conciliate. It was &s;till his intention, that the nuptials of Vivaldi and Ellena &s;hould be privately &s;olemnized immediately on the relea&s;e of the pri&s;oner, who, even if he had rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect Schedoni for his late per&s;ecutor, would then be
<PB N="179" REF="032735_0469_0FF498A310A79C60">
intere&s;ted in concealing his &s;u&s;picions for ever, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rom whom therefore, no evil was to be apprehended.</P>
<P>How little did Vivaldi fore&s;ee, that in repeating to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he tribunal the &s;tranger's &s;ummons of father Schedo|ni, he was deferring, or, perhaps, wholly preventing his own marriage with Ellena di Ro&s;alba! How little, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l&s;o, did he apprehend what would be the further con|&s;equence of a di&s;clo&s;ure, which the peculiar circum|&s;tances of his &s;ituation had hardly permitted him to withhold, though, could he have under&s;tood the proba|ble event of it, he would have braved all the terrors of the tribunal, and death it&s;elf, rather than incur the re|mor&s;e of having promoted it.</P>
<P>The motive for his arre&s;tation was concealed from Schedoni, who had not the remote&s;t &s;u&s;picion of its nature, but attributed the arre&s;t, to a di&s;covery, which the tribunal had made of his being the accu&s;er of Vi|valdi. This di&s;clo&s;ure he attributed to his own im|prudence, in having &s;tated as an in&s;tance of Vivaldi's contempt for the Catholic faith, that he had in&s;ulted a prie&s;t while doing penance in the church of the &s;pi|rito Santo. But by what art the tribunal had di&s;co|vered that he was the prie&s;t alluded to, and the author of the accu&s;ation, Schedoni could by no mean con|jecture. He was willing to believe that this arre&s;t was only for the purpo&s;e of obtaining proof of Vival|di's guilt; and the Confe&s;&s;or knew that he could &s;o conduct him&s;elf in evidence, as in all probability to exculpate the pri&s;oner, from whom, when he &s;hould explain him&s;elf, no re&s;entment on account of his for|mer conduct was to be apprehended. Yet Schedoni was not perfectly at ea&s;e; for it was po&s;&s;ible that a knowledge of Vivaldi's &s;ituation, and of the author of it, had reached his family, and had produced his own arre&s;t. On this head, however, his fears were not powerful; &s;ince, the longer he dwelt upon the &s;ub|ject, the more improbable it appeared that &s;uch a di&s;|clo&s;ure,
<PB N="180" REF="032735_0470_0FF4984969D13340">
at lea&s;t &s;o far as it related to him&s;elf, could have been affected.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, from the night of his late examination, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not called upon, till Schedoni and father An&s;aldo ap|peared together in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the tribunal. The two latter had already been &s;eparately examined, and An|&s;aldo had privately &s;tated the particulars of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he had received on the vigil of the Santo Marco in the year 1752, for which di&s;clo&s;ure he had received formal ab&s;olution. What had pa&s;&s;ed at that examina|tion does not appear, but on this his &s;econd interroga|tion, he was required to repeat the &s;ubject and the cir|cum&s;tances of the confe&s;&s;ion. This was probably with a veiw of ob&s;erving its effect upon Schedoni and on Vivaldi, which would direct the opinion of the tribunal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s to the guilt of the confe&s;&s;or, and the veracity of the young pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>On this night a very exact inquiry was made, con|cerning every per&s;on, who had obtained admi&s;&s;ion into the hall of ju&s;tice; &s;uch officials as were not immedi|ately nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the ceremonies of the tribu|nal were excluded, together with every other per&s;on belonging to the Inqui&s;ition not material to the evi|dence, or to the judges. When this &s;crutiny was o|ver, the pri&s;oners were brought in, and their conduc|tors ordered to withdraw. A &s;ilence of &s;ome moments prevailed in the hall; and, however different might be the reflections of the &s;everal pri&s;oners, the degree of anxious expectation was in each, probably, nearly the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The grand-vicar having &s;poken a few words in pri|vate to a per&s;on on his left hand, an inqui&s;itor ro&s;e.</P>
<P>"If any per&s;on in this court," &s;aid he, "is known by the name of father Schedoni, belonging to the Do|minican &s;ociety of the Spirito Santo at Naples, let him appear!"</P>
<P>Schedoni an&s;wered the &s;ummons. He came for|ward
<PB N="181" REF="032735_0471_0FF498AD99793998">
with a firm &s;tep, and having cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and bowed to the tribunal, awaited in &s;ilence its commands.</P>
<P>The penitentiary An&s;aldo was next called upon. Vivaldi ob&s;erved that he faultered as he advanced: and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">is obei&s;ance to the tribunal was more profound than Schedoni's had been. Vivaldi him&s;elf was then &s;ummoned; his air was calm and dignified, and his countenance expre&s;&s;ed the &s;olemn energy of his feel|ings, but nothing of dejection.</P>
<P>Schedoni and An&s;aldo were now, for the fir&s;t time, confronted. Whatever might be the feelings of Sche|doni on beholding the penitentiary of the <HI>Santa del Pianto,</HI> he effectually concealed them.</P>
<P>The grand-vicar him&s;elf opened the examination. "you father Schedoni, of the Spirito Santo," he &s;aid, "an&s;wer and &s;ay whether the per&s;on who &s;tands before you, bearing the title of grand penitentiary of the or|der of the <HI>Black Penitents,</HI> and pre&s;iding over the con|vent of the <HI>Santa Maria del Pianto</HI> at Naples, is known to you."</P>
<P>To this requi&s;ition, Schedoni replied with firmne&s;s in the negative.</P>
<P>"You have never, to your knowledge, &s;een him be|fore this hour?"</P>
<P>"Never!" &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>"Let the oath be admini&s;tered&punc;" added the grand-vicar. Schedoni having accepted it; the &s;ame que&s;ti|ons were put to An&s;aldo concerning the Confe&s;&s;or, when to the a&s;toni&s;hment of Vivaldi and of the grea|ter part of the court, the penitentiary denied all know|ledge of Schedoni. His negative was given, however, in a le&s;s deci&s;ive manner than that of the Confe&s;&s;or, and when the u&s;ual oath was offered, An&s;aldo declined to accept it.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was next called upon to identify Schedoni: he declared, that the per&s;on who was then pointed out to him, he had never known by any other denomina|tion
<PB N="182" REF="032735_0472_0FF49853D7E83D40">
than that of father Schedoni; and that he had al|ways under&s;tood him to be a monk of the Spirito San|to; but Vivaldi was at the &s;ame time careful to repeat, that he knew nothing further relative to his life.</P>
<P>Schedoni was &s;omewhat &s;urprized at this apparent candor of Vivaldi towards him&s;elf, but accu&s;tomed to impute an evil motive to all conduct, which he could not clearly comprehend, he did not &s;cruple to believe, that &s;ome latent mi&s;chief was directed again&s;t him in this &s;eemingly hone&s;t declaration.</P>
<P>After <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ome further preliminary forms had pa&s;&s;ed, An&s;aldo was ordered to relate the particulars of the confe&s;&s;ion, which had been made to him on the eve of the Santo Marco. It mu&s;t be remembered, that this was &s;till what is called in the Inqui&s;ition, a <HI>private</HI> examination.</P>
<P>After he had taken the cu&s;tomary oaths to relate neither more nor le&s;s than the truth of what had pa&s;&s;|ed before him, An&s;aldo's depo&s;itions were written down nearly in the following words; to which Vival|di li&s;tened with almo&s;t trembling attention, for be&s;ides the curio&s;ity which &s;ome previous circum&s;tances had excited re&s;pecting them, he believed that his own fate in a great mea&s;ure depended upon a di&s;covery of the fact to which they led. What, if he had &s;urmi&s;ed how much! and that the per&s;on, whom he had been in &s;ome degree in&s;trumental in citing before this tremendous tribunal was the father of his Ellena di Ro&s;alba!</P>
<P>An&s;aldo having again an&s;wered to his name and ti|tles, gave his depo&s;ition as follows:</P>
<P>"It was on the eve of the twenty-fifth of April, and in the year 1752, that as I &s;at, according to my cu&s;tom, in the confe&s;&s;ional of San Marco, I was alar|med by deep groans, which came from the box on my left hand."</P>
<P>Vivaldi ob&s;erved, that the date now mentioned a|greed with that recorded by the &s;tranger, and he was
<PB N="183" REF="032735_0473_0FF498AF2092A750">
thus prepared to believe what might follow, and to give his confidence to this extraordinary and un&s;een per&s;onage.</P>
<P>An&s;aldo continued, "I was more alarmed by the&s;e &s;ounds, becau&s;e I had not been prepared for them; I knew not that any per&s;on was in the confe&s;&s;ional nor had ob&s;erved any one pa&s;s along the ai&s;le&mdash;but the du&s;kine&s;s of the hour may account for my having failed to do &s;o; it was after &s;un-&s;et, and the tapers at the &s;hrine of San Antonio as yet burned feebly in the twilight."</P>
<P>"Be brief, holy father," &s;aid the inqui&s;itor, who had formerly been mo&s;t active in examining Vivaldi; &s;peak clo&s;ely to the point."</P>
<P>"The groans would &s;ometimes cea&s;e," re&s;umed An&s;aldo, "and long pau&s;es of &s;ilence follow; they were tho&s;e of a &s;oul in agony, &s;truggling with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, yet wanting re&s;olution to con|fe&s;s it. I tried to encourage the penitent, and held forth every hope of mercy and forgivene&s;s which my duty would allow, but for a con&s;iderable time with|out effect;&mdash;the enormity of the &s;in &s;eemed too big for utterance, yet the penitent appeared equally un|able to endure the concealment of it. His heart was bur&s;ting with the &s;ecret, and required the comfort of ab&s;olution, even at the price of the &s;evere&s;t penance."</P>
<P>"Facts!" &s;aid the inqui&s;itor; "the&s;e are only &s;ur|mi&s;es."</P>
<P>"Facts will come too &s;oon?" replied An&s;aldo, and bowed his head: "the mention of them will petrify you, holy fathers! as they did me, though not for the &s;ame rea&s;ons. While I endeavoured to encourage the penitent, and a&s;&s;ured him, that ab&s;olution &s;hould fol|low the acknowledgement of his crimes, however heinous tho&s;e crimes might be if accompanied by &s;in|cere repentance, he more than once began his confe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;ion, and abruptly dropt it. Once, indeed, he quit|ted
<PB N="184" REF="032735_0474_0FF498555E30D9F0">
the confe&s;&s;ional; his agitated &s;pirit required liber|ty; and it was then, as he walked with perturbed &s;teps along the ai&s;le, that I fir&s;t ob&s;erved his figure. He was in the habit of a white friar, and as nearly as I can recollect, was about the &s;tature of him, the father, Schedoni, who now &s;tands before me."</P>
<P>As An&s;aldo delivered the&s;e words, the attention of the whole trib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nal was turned upon Schedoni, who &s;tood unmoved, and with his eyes bent towards the ground.</P>
<P>"His face." continued the penitentiary, "I did not &s;ee; he was, with good rea&s;on, careful to conceal it; other re&s;emblance, therefore, than the &s;tature, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cannot point out between them. The voice, indeed, the voice of the penitent, I think I &s;hall never forget; I &s;hould know it again at any di&s;tance of time."</P>
<P>"Has it not &s;truck your ear, &s;ince you came with|in the&s;e walls!" &s;aid a member of the tribunal.</P>
<P>"Of that hereafter," ob&s;erved, the inqui&s;itor, "you wander from the point father."</P>
<P>The vicar-general remarked, that the circum&s;tan|ces ju&s;t related were important, and ought not to be pa&s;&s;ed over as irrevalent. The inqui&s;itor &s;ubmitted to this opinion, but objected that they were not perti|nent to the moment; and An&s;aldo was again bidden to repeat what he had heard at confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"When the &s;tranger returned to the &s;teps of the confe&s;&s;ional, he had acquired &s;ufficient re&s;olution to go through with the ta&s;k he had impo&s;ed upon him|&s;elf, and a thrilling voice &s;poke through the grate the facts I am about to relate."</P>
<P>father An&s;aldo pau&s;ed, and was &s;omewhat agitated; he &s;eemed endeavouring to recollect courage to go through with what he had begun During this pau&s;e, the &s;ilence of expectation rapt the court, and the eyes of the tribunal were directed alternately to An&s;aldo and Schedoni, who certainly required &s;omething more
<PB N="185" REF="032735_0475_0FF498B0A4B00F30">
than human firmne&s;s to &s;upport unmoved the &s;evere &s;crutiny, and the yet &s;everer &s;u&s;picions, to which he &s;tood expo&s;ed. Whether, however, it was the forti|tude of con&s;cious innocence, or the hardihood of atro|cious vice, that protected the Confe&s;&s;or, he certainly did not betray any emotion. Vivaldi, who had un|cea&s;ingly ob&s;erved him from the commencement of the depo&s;itions, felt inclined to believe that he was not the penitent de&s;cribed. An&s;aldo, having, at length, recol|lected him&s;elf, proceeded as follows:</P>
<P>"I have been through life," &s;aid the penitent, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lave of my pa&s;&s;ions, and they have led me into horri|exce&s;&s;es. I had once a brother!"&mdash;He &s;topped, and deep groans again told the agony of his &s;oul; at length, he added,&mdash;"that brother had a wife."&mdash;Now li&s;ten, father, and &s;ay, whether guilt like mine may hope for ab&s;olution? She was beautiful&mdash;I loved her: &s;he was virtuous, and I de&s;paired. You, father,' he continued in a frightful tone, 'never knew the fury of de&s;pair! It overcame or communicated its own force to every other pa&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul, and I &s;ought to relea&s;e my&s;elf from its tortures by any means." My brother died!'&mdash;The penitent pau&s;ed again,' con|tinued An&s;aldo, 'I trembled while I li&s;tened; my lips were &s;ealed. At length, I bade him proceed, and he &s;poke as follows.&mdash;'My brother died a di&s;tance from home.'&mdash;Again the penitent pau&s;ed, and the &s;ilence continued &s;o long, that I thought it proper to enquire of what di&s;order the brother had expired, 'Father, I was his murderer?' &s;aid the penitent, in a voice which I never can forget; it &s;unk into my heart."</P>
<P>An&s;aldo appeared affected by the remembrance, and was for a moment &s;ilent. At the la&s;t words Vivaldi had particularly noticed Schedoni, that he might judge by their effect upon him whether he was guilty; but he remained in his former attitude, and his eyes were &s;till fixed upon the ground.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="032735_0476_0FF49856E3E53968">
"Proceed, father!" &s;aid the inqui&s;itor, "what was your reply to this confe&s;&s;ion?"</P>
<P>"I was &s;ilent," &s;aid An&s;aldo; "but at length I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the penitent go on. 'I contrived, &s;aid he, that my brother &s;hould die at a di&s;tance from home, and I &s;o con|ducted the affair that his widow never &s;u&s;pected the cau&s;e of his death. It was not till long, after the u&s;u|al time of mourning had expired, that I ventured to &s;olicit her hand: but &s;he had not yet forgotten my bro|ther, and &s;he rejected me. My pa&s;&s;ion would no lon|ger be trifled with. I cau&s;ed her to be carried from her hou&s;e, and &s;he was afterwards willing to retrieve her honour by the marriage vow. I had &s;acrified my con&s;cience, without having found happine&s;s;&mdash;&s;he did not even conde&s;cend to conceal her di&s;dain. Mortified, exa&s;perated by her conduct, I began to &s;u&s;|pect that &s;ome other emotion than re&s;entment occa&s;ion|ed this di&s;dain; and la&s;t of all, jealou&s;y&mdash;jealou&s;y came to crown my mi&s;ery&mdash;to light up all my pa&s;&s;ions into madne&s;s!"</P>
<P>"The penitent," added An&s;aldo, "appeared, by the manner in which he uttered this, to be nearly frantic at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> moment, and convul&s;ive &s;obs &s;oon &s;tifled his words&punc; when he re&s;umed his confe&s;&s;ion, he &s;aid, "I &s;oon found an object for my jealou&s;y. Among the few per&s;ons who vi&s;ited us in the retirement of our country re&s;i|dence, was a gentleman, who, I fancied, loved my wife I fancied too, that whenever he appeared, an air of particular &s;atisfaction was vi&s;ible on her countenance.' She &s;eemed to have plea&s;ure in conver&s;ing with, and &s;hewing him di&s;tinction. I even &s;ometimes thought, &s;he had pride in di&s;playing to me the preference &s;he entertained for him, and that an air of triumph, and even of &s;corn, was addre&s;&s;ed to me, whenever &s;he mentioned his name. Perhaps I mi&s;took re&s;entment for love, and &s;he only wi&s;hed to puni&s;h me, by exciting my jealou&s;y. Fatal error! &s;he puni&s;hed her&s;elf al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="032735_0477_0FF498B22A278100">
"Be le&s;s circum&s;tantial, father," &s;aid the inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>An&s;aldo bowed his head, and continued, "One e|vening" continued the penitent, "that I returned home unexpectedly, I was told that a vi&s;itor was with my wife! As I approached the apartment where they &s;at, I heard the voice of Sacchi; it &s;eemed mournful and &s;upplicating. I &s;topped to li&s;ten, and di&s;tingui&s;hed though to fire me with vengeance. I re&s;trained my|&s;elf, however, &s;o far as to &s;tep &s;oftly to a lattice that opened from the pa&s;&s;age, and overlooked the apartment. The traitor was on his knee before her. Whether &s;he had heard my &s;tep, or ob&s;erved my face, through the high lattice, or that &s;he re&s;ented his conduct, I know not, but &s;he ro&s;e immediately from her chair. I did not pau&s;e to que&s;tion her motive; but, &s;eizing my &s;tiletto, I ru&s;hed into the room, with intent to &s;trike it to the villain's heart. The &s;uppo&s;ed a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of my honor e&s;caped into the garden, and was heard of no more"&mdash;But your wife? &s;aid I. "Her bo&s;om receives the poignard!" replied the penitent."</P>
<P>An&s;aldo's voice faultered, as he repeated this part of the confe&s;&s;ion, and he was utterly unable to proceed. The tribunal, ob&s;erving his condition, allowed him a chair, and, after a &s;truggle of &s;ome moments, he added, "Think, holy father, O think! what mu&s;t have been my feelings at that in&s;tant! I was my&s;elf the lover of the woman, whom he confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to have mur|dered."</P>
<P>"Was &s;he innocent?" &s;aid a voice; and Vivaldi, who&s;e attention had latterly been fixed upon An&s;aldo, now, on looking at Schedoni, perceived that it was he who had &s;poken. At the &s;ound of his voice, the peni|tentiary turned in&s;tantly towards him. There was a pau&s;e of a general &s;ilence, during which An&s;aldo's eyes were earne&s;tly fixed upon the accu&s;ed. At length, he &s;poke, "She was innocent!" He replied, with &s;o|lemn empha&s;is, "She was mo&s;t virtuous!"</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="032735_0478_0FF49858696B93A0">
Schedoni had &s;hrunk back within him&s;elf; he a&s;ked no further. A murmur ran through the tribunal, which ro&s;e by degrees, till it broke forth into audible conver&s;ation; at length, the &s;ecretary was directed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> note the que&s;tion of Schedoni.</P>
<P>"Was that the voice of the penitent, which you have ju&s;t heard?" demanded the inqui&s;itor of An&s;aldo. "Remember, you have &s;aid that you &s;hould know it again!"</P>
<P>"I think it was," replied An&s;aldo; "but I cannot &s;wear to that."</P>
<P>"What infirmity of judgment is this!" &s;aid the &s;ame inqui&s;itor, who him&s;elf was &s;eldom troubled with the mode&s;ty of doubt, upon any &s;ubject. An&s;aldo was bidden to re&s;ume the narrative.</P>
<P>"On this di&s;covery of the murderer," &s;aid the pen|itentiary, "I quitted the confe&s;&s;ional, and my &s;en&s;es for&s;ook me before I could deliver orders for the detec|tion of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. When I recovered it was too late; he had e&s;caped! From that hour to the pre&s;ent, I have never &s;een him, nor dare I affirm that the per&s;on now before me is he."</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itor was about to &s;peak, but the grand-vicar waved his hand, as a &s;ignal for attention, and addre&s;&s;ing An&s;aldo, &s;aid, "Although you may be un|acquainted with Schedoni, the monk of the Spirito Santo reverend father, can you not recollect the per&s;on of the Count di Bruno, your former friend?"</P>
<P>An&s;aldo again looked at Schedoni, with a &s;crutini|zing eye&punc; he fixed it long; but the countenance of Sche|doni &s;uffered no change.</P>
<P>"No!" &s;aid the penitentiary, at length, "I dare not take upon me to a&s;&s;ert that this is the Count di Bruno. If it is he, years have wrought deeply on his features. That the penitent was the Count di Bruno I have proof; he mentioned my name as his vi&s;itor, and particular circum&s;tances known
<PB N="189" REF="032735_0479_0FF498BDA92EF800">
only to the Count and my&s;elf; but that father Schedoni was the penitent, I repeat it, I dare not af|firm."</P>
<P>"But that dare I!" &s;aid another voice; and Vival|di, turning towards it, beheld the my&s;terious &s;tranger advancing, his cowl now thrown back, and an air of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> over&s;preading very terrific features. Sche|doni, in the in&s;tant that he perceived him, &s;eemed agi|tated; his countenance, for the fir&s;t time, &s;uffered &s;ome change.</P>
<P>The tribunal was profoundly &s;ilent, but &s;urprize, and a kind of re&s;tle&s;s expectation, marked every brow. Vivaldi was about to exclaim, "That is my inform|er!" when the voice of the &s;tranger checked him.</P>
<P>"Do&s;t thou know me?" &s;aid he &s;ternly, to Sche|doni, and his attitude became fixed.</P>
<P>Schedoni gave no reply.</P>
<P>"Do&s;t thou know me?" repeated the accu&s;er, in a &s;teady &s;olemn voice.</P>
<P>"Know thee?" uttered Schedoni, faintly,</P>
<P>"Do&s;t thou know this?" cried the &s;tranger, rai|&s;ing his voice, as he drew from his garment what ap|peared to be a dagger. "Do&s;t thou know the&s;e in|delible &s;tains?" &s;aid he, lifting the poignard, and with an out&s;tretched arm, pointing it towards Schedoni.</P>
<P>The confe&s;&s;or turned away his face; it &s;eemed as if his heart &s;ickened.</P>
<P>"With this dagger was thy brother &s;lain!" &s;aid the terrible &s;tranger. "Shall I declare my&s;elf?"</P>
<P>Schedoni's courage for&s;ook him, and he &s;unk a|gain&s;t a pillar of the hall for &s;upport.</P>
<P>The Con&s;ternation was now general: the extra|ordinary appearance and conduct of the &s;tranger &s;eem|ed to &s;trike the greater part of the tribunal, a tribunal of the inqui&s;ition it&s;elf! with di&s;may. Several of the members ro&s;e from their &s;eats; others called aloud for the officials, who kept guard at the doors of the hall,
<PB N="190" REF="032735_0480_0FF49863B95B5980">
and inquired who had admitted the &s;tranger, while the vicar-general and a few inqui&s;itors conver&s;ed private|ly together, during which they frequently looked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;tranger and at Schedoni, as if they were the &s;ub|jects of the di&s;cour&s;e. Meanwhile the Monk remain|ed with the dagger in his gra&s;p, and his eyes fixed on the Confe&s;&s;or, who&s;e face was &s;till averted; and who yet &s;upported him&s;elf again&s;t the pillar.</P>
<P>At length, the vicar-general called upon the mem|bers who had ri&s;en to return to their &s;eats, and or|dered that the officials &s;hould withdraw to their po&s;ts.</P>
<P>"Holy brethern!" &s;aid the vicar, we recommend to you, at this important hour, &s;ilence and delibera|tion. Let the examination of the accu&s;ed proceed; and hereafter let us inquire as to the admittance of the accu&s;er. For the pre&s;ent, &s;uffer him al&s;o to have hearing and the father Schedoni to reply.</P>
<P>"We &s;uffer him!" an&s;wered the tribunal, and bow|ed their heads.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who, during the tumult, had ineffectually endeavoured to make him&s;elf heard, now profited by the pau&s;e which followed the a&s;&s;ent of the inqui&s;itors, to claim attention: but the in&s;tant he &s;poke, &s;everal members impatiently bade that the examination &s;hould proceed, and the grand-vicar was again oblig|ed to command &s;ilence, before the reque&s;t of Vivaldi could be under&s;tood. Permi&s;&s;ion to &s;peak being grant|ed him, "That per&s;on," &s;aid he, pointing to the &s;tranger, "is the &s;ame who vi&s;ited me in my pri&s;on; and the dagger the &s;ame he now di&s;plays! It was he, who commanded me to &s;ummon the penitentiary An|&s;aldo, and the father Schedoni. I have acquitted my|&s;elf, and have nothing further to do in this &s;truggle."</P>
<P>The tribunal was again agitated, and the murmurs of private conver&s;ation again prevailed.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Schedoni appeared to have recovered &s;ome degree of &s;elf-command; he rai&s;ed him&s;elf, and
<PB N="191" REF="032735_0481_0FF46EC8655E4CA8">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">owing to the tribunal, &s;eemed preparing to &s;peak; but waited till the confu&s;ion of &s;ound that filled the hall &s;hould &s;ub&s;ide. At length he could be heard, and, addre&s;&s;ing the tribunal, he &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Holy fathers! the &s;tranger who is now before you is an impo&s;tor! I will prove that my accu&s;er was once my friend;&mdash;you may perceive how much the di&s;covery of his perfidy affects me. The charge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> brings is mo&s;t fal&s;e and malicious!"</P>
<P>"<HI>Once</HI> thy friend!" replied the &s;tranger, with pe|culiar empha&s;is, "and what has made me thy enemy! View the&s;e &s;pots," he continued, pointing to the blade of the poignard, "are they al&s;o fal&s;e and mali|cious? are they not, on the contrary, reflected on thy con&s;cience!"</P>
<P>"I know them not," replied Schedoni, "my con|&s;cience is un&s;tained."</P>
<P>"A brother's blood <HI>has</HI> &s;tained it!" &s;aid the &s;tran|ger in a hollow voice.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who&s;e attention was now fixed upon Sche|doni, ob&s;erved a lived hue over-&s;pread his complexion, and that his eyes were averted from this extraordinary per&s;on with horror; the &s;pectre of his decea&s;ed brother could &s;carcely have called forth a &s;tronger expre&s;&s;ion. It was not immediately that he could command his voice; when he could, he again appealed to the tri|bunal,</P>
<P>"Holy fathers!" &s;aid he, &s;uffer me to defend my|&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Holy fathers!" &s;aid the accu&s;er, with &s;olemnity, "hear! hear what I &s;hall unfold!"</P>
<P>Schedoni, who &s;eemed to &s;peak by a &s;trong effort only, again addre&s;&s;ed the inqui&s;itors; "I will prove," &s;aid he, "that this evidence is not of a nature to be tru&s;ted."</P>
<P>"I will bring <HI>&s;uch</HI> proof to the contrary, &s;aid the monk "And here," pointing to An&s;aldo, "is &s;ufficient te&s;|timony,
<PB N="192" REF="032735_0482_0FF49865572A09D8">
that the Count di Bruno did confe&s;s him&s;elf guilty of murder."</P>
<P>The court commanded &s;ilence, and upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the &s;tranger to An&s;aldo, the penitentiary was a&s;ked whether he knew him. He replied that he did not,</P>
<P>"Recollect your&s;elf," &s;aid the grand inqui&s;itor:&punc; it is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence that you &s;hould be cor|rect on this point."</P>
<P>The penitentiary ob&s;erved the &s;tranger with deep attention, and then repeated his a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>"Have you never &s;een him before?" &s;aid an in|qui&s;itor.</P>
<P>"Never, to my knowledge!" replid An&s;aldo.</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itors looked upon each other in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"He &s;peaks the truth," &s;aid the &s;tranger.</P>
<P>This extraordinary fact did not fail to &s;trike the tribunal, and to a&s;toni&s;h Vivaldi. Since the accu&s;er confirmed it, Vivaldi was at a lo&s;s to under&s;tand the means by which he could have become acquainted with the guilt of Schedoni, who it was not to be &s;up|po&s;ed, would have acknowledged crimes of &s;uch mag|nitude as tho&s;e contained in the accu&s;ation, to any per|&s;on, except, indeed, to his confe&s;&s;or, and this confe&s;|&s;or, it appeared, was &s;o far from having betrayed his tru&s;t to the accu&s;er, that he did not even know him. Vivaldi was no le&s;s perplexed as what would be the nature of the te&s;timony with which the accu&s;er de&s;ign|ed to &s;upport his charges; but the pau&s;e of general amazement, which had permitted Vivaldi the&s;e con&s;i|derations, was now at an end: the tribunal re&s;umed the examination, and the grand inqui&s;itor called aloud.</P>
<P>"You, Vincentio di Vivaldi, an&s;wer with exact|ne&s;s to the que&s;tions that &s;hall be put to you."</P>
<P>He was then a&s;ked &s;ome que&s;tions relative to the per&s;on who had vi&s;ited him in pri&s;on. In his an&s;wers, Vivaldi was clear and conci&s;e, con&s;tantly affirming, that the &s;tranger was the &s;ame who now accu&s;ed Schedoni.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="032735_0483_0FF498C0B7010A18">
When the accu&s;er was interogated, he acknowledg|ed, without he&s;itation, that Vivaldi had &s;poken the truth. He was then a&s;ked his motive for that extraor|dinary vi&s;it.</P>
<P>"It was," replied the monk, "that a murderer might be brought to ju&s;tice."</P>
<P>"This," ob&s;erved the grand inqui&s;itor, "might have been accompli&s;hed by fair and open accu&s;ation. If you had known the charge to be ju&s;t, it is probable that you would have appealed directly to this tribunal, in&s;tead of endeavouring in&s;iduou&s;ly to obtain an influ|ence over the mind of a pri&s;oner, and urging him to become the in&s;trument of bringing the accu&s;ed to pu|ni&s;hment."</P>
<P>"Yet I have not &s;hrunk from di&s;covery," ob&s;erved the &s;tranger, calmly; I have voluntarily appeared,"</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, Schedoni &s;eemed again much agita|ted, and even drew his hood over his eyes.</P>
<P>"That is ju&s;t," &s;aid the grand inqui&s;itor, addre&s;&s;ing the &s;tranger:&mdash;but you have neither declared your name, or whence you come!"</P>
<P>To this remark the monk made no reply; but Sche|doni, with reviving &s;pirit, urged the circum&s;tance, in evidence of the malignity a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d fal&s;hood of the accu&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>"Wilt thou compel me to reveal my proof?" &s;aid the &s;tranger: "Dare&s;t thou to do &s;o?"</P>
<P>"Why &s;hould I fear thee?" an&s;wered Schedoni.</P>
<P>"A&s;k thy con&s;cience, &s;aid the &s;tranger, with a teri|ble frown.</P>
<P>The tribunal again &s;u&s;pended the examination, and con&s;ulted in private together.</P>
<P>To the la&s;t exhortation of the monk, Schedoni was &s;ilent. Vivaldi ob&s;erved, that during this &s;hort dia|logue, the Confe&s;&s;or had never once turned his eyes towards the &s;tranger, but apparently avoided him, as an object too affecting to be looked upon. He judg|ed, from this circum&s;tance, and from &s;ome other ap|pearances
<PB N="194" REF="032735_0484_0FF49866DEECD6F0">
in his conduct, that Schedoni was guilty&punc; yet the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt alone did not perfectly account, he thought, for the &s;trong emotion, with which he avoided the &s;ight of his accu&s;er&mdash;unle&s;s, in|deed, he knew the accu&s;er to have been, not only an accomplice in his crime, but the actual a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. In this ca&s;e, it appeared natural even for the &s;tern and &s;ubtle Schedoni to betray his horror, on beholding the per&s;on of the murderer, with the very in&s;trument of the crime in his gra&s;p. On the other hand, Vivaldi could not but perceive it to be highly improbable, that the very man who had really committed the deed, &s;hould come voluntarily into a court of ju&s;tice, for the purpo&s;e of accu&s;ing his employer; that he &s;hould dare publicly to accu&s;e him, who&s;e guilt, however enormous, was not more &s;o than his own.</P>
<P>The extraordinary manner, al&s;o, in which the accu&s;er had proceeded in the commencement of the af|fair, engaged Vivaldi's con&s;ideration; his apparent reluctance to be &s;een in this proce&s;s, and the artful and my&s;terious plan by which he had cau&s;ed Schedoni to be &s;ummoned before the tribunal, and had endea|voured that he &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> accu&s;ed by An&s;aldo, indicated, at lea&s;t to Vivaldi's apprehen&s;ion, the fear|fulne&s;s of guilt, and, &s;till more, that malice, and a thir&s;t of vengeance, had in&s;tigated his conduct in the pro&s;e|cution. If the &s;tranger had been actuated only by a love of ju&s;tice, it appeared that he would not have pro|ceeded toward it in a way thus dark and circuitous, but have &s;ought it by the u&s;ual proce&s;s, and have pro|duced the proofs which he even now a&s;&s;erted he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, of Schedoni's crimes. In addition to the cir|cum&s;tances, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eemed to &s;trengthen a &s;uppo&s;ition of the guiltle&s;&s;ne&s;s of Schedoni was that, of the accu|&s;er's avoiding to acknowledge who he was, and whence he came. But Vivaldi pau&s;ed again upon this point; it appeared to be inexplicable, and he could not ina|gine
<PB N="195" REF="032735_0485_0FF498C24206E3F0">
why the accu&s;er had adopted a &s;tyle of &s;ecrecy, which, if, he per&s;i&s;ted in it, mu&s;t probably defeat the very purpo&s;e of the accu&s;ation; for Vivaldi did not believe that the tribunal would condemn a pri&s;oner upon the te&s;timony of a per&s;on, who, when called up|on&punc; &s;hould publicly refu&s;e to reveal him&s;elf, even to them. Yet the accu&s;er mu&s;t certainly have con&s;ider|ed this circum&s;tance before he ventured into court; notwith&s;tanding which, he had appeared!</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections led Vivaldi to various conjectures relative to the vi&s;it he had him&s;elf received from the monk, the dream that had preceded it, the extraor|dinary means by which he had obtained admittance to the pri&s;on, the declaration of the continels, that not any per&s;on had pa&s;&s;ed the door, and many other unac|countable particulars; and while Vivaldi now looked upon the wild phy&s;iognomy of the &s;tranger, he almo&s;t fancied, as he had formerly done, that he beheld &s;ome|thing not of this earth.</P>
<P>"I have heard of the &s;pirit of the murdered." &s;aid he, to him&s;elf&mdash;"re&s;tle&s;s for ju&s;tice, becoming vi&s;ible in our world&mdash;" But Vivaldi checked the imperfect thought, and, though his imagination inclined him to the marvellous and to admit ideas which, filling and expanded all the faculties of the &s;oul, produce feelings that partake of the &s;ublime, he now re&s;i&s;ted the pro|pen&s;ity, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, as ab&s;urd, a &s;uppo&s;ition which had begun to thrill his every nerve with horror. He awaited, however the re&s;ult of the examination, and what might be the further conduct of the &s;tranger, with inten&s;e expectation.</P>
<P>When the tribunal had, at length, finally determined on the method of their proceedings, Schedoni was fir&s;t called upon, and examined as to his knowledge of the accu&s;er." It was the &s;ame inqui&s;itor who had formerly interrogated Vivaldi, that now &s;poke. "You, father Schedoni, a monk of the Spirito Santo convent, at Na|ples,

otherwi&s;e Ferando Count di Bruno, an&s;wer to the que&s;tions which &s;hall be put to you. Do you know the name of this man who now appears as your accu&s;er?"</P>
<P>"I an&s;wer not to the title of Count di Bruno," re|plied the Confe&s;&s;or, "but I will declare that I know this man. His name is Nicola di Zampari."</P>
<P>"What is his condition?"</P>
<P>"He is a monk of the Dominican convent of the Spirito Santo," replied Schedoni. "Of his family I know little."</P>
<P>Where have you &s;een him?"</P>
<P>"In the city of Naples, where he has re&s;ided, during &s;ome years, beneath the &s;ame roof with me, when I was of the convent of San Angiolo, and &s;ince that time, in the Spirito Santo."</P>
<P>"You have been a re&s;ident at the San Angiolo?" &s;aid the inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>"I have," replied Schedoni; "and it was there that we fir&s;t lived together in the confidence of friend|&s;hip."</P>
<P>"You now perceive how ill placed was that confi|dence," &s;aid the inqui&s;itor, "and repent, no doubt, of your imprudence?"</P>
<P>The very Schedoni was not entrapped by this ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t lament a di&s;covery of ingratitude," he re|plied, calmy, "but the &s;ubjects of my confidence were too pure to give occa&s;ion for repentance."</P>
<P>"This Nicola di Zampari was ungrateful, then? You had rendered him &s;ervices? &s;aid the inqui|&s;itor.</P>
<P>"Explain," &s;aid the &s;tranger, &s;olemnly.</P>
<P>Schedoni he&s;itated, &s;ome &s;udden con&s;ideration &s;eem|ed to occa&s;ion him perplexity.</P>
<P>"I call upon you, in the name of your decea&s;ed bro|ther," &s;aid the accu&s;er, "to reveal the cau&s;e of my enmity!"</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="032735_0487_0FF498CE93D49D48">
Vivaldi, &s;truck by the tone in which the &s;tranger &s;poke this, turned his eyes upon him, but knew not how to interpret the emotion vi&s;ible on his counte|nance</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itor commanded Schedoni to explain him&s;elf; the latter could not immediately reply, but, when he recovered a &s;elf-command he added,</P>
<P>"I promi&s;ed this accu&s;er, this Nicola di Zampari, to a&s;&s;i&s;t his preferment with what little intere&s;t I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; it was but little.

<P>Schedoni pau&s;ed, and an air of di&s;&s;atisfaction and anxiety appeared upon his features. His accu&s;er re|mained &s;ilent, but a malicious &s;mile announced his triumph.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t declare, al&s;o the &s;ervices," &s;aid the in|qui&s;itor, "which merited the reward you promi&s;ed."</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e &s;ervices were ine&s;timable to me," re&s;um|ed Schedoni, after a momentary he&s;itation; "though they co&s;t di Zampari little: they were the con&s;olations of &s;ympathy, the intelligence of friend&s;hip, which he admini&s;tered, and which gratitude told me never could be repaid."</P>
<P>"Of &s;ympathy! of friend&s;hip!" &s;aid the grand-vi|car.

<P>Schedoni bowed his head. The inqui&s;itor, then ad|dre&s;&s;ing the accu&s;er, demanded what he had to reply.</P>
<P>"I have nothing to reply," &s;aid the &s;tranger, with malicious triumph; "the accu&s;ed has replied for me!"</P>
<P>"We are to conclude, then, that he has &s;poken truth, when he a&s;&s;erted you to be a monk of the Spiri|to Santo, at Naples?" &s;aid the inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>"You holy father," &s;aid the &s;tranger, gravely, ap|pealing to the inqui&s;itor, "can an&s;wer for me whether I am."</P>
<P>Vivaldi li&s;tened with emotion.</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itor ro&s;e from his chair, and with &s;olem|nity replied, "I an&s;wer then, that you are not a monk of Naples."</P>
<P>"By that reply," &s;aid the vickar-general, in a low voice to the inqui&s;itor, "I perceive you think father Schedoni is guilty."</P>
<P>The rejoinder of the inqui&s;itor was delivered in &s;o low a tone that Vivaldi could not under&s;tand it. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> perplexed to interpret the an&s;wer given to the appeal of the &s;tranger, He thought that the inqui&s;itor would not have ventured an a&s;&s;ertion thus p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tive, if

his opinion had been drawn from inference only; and that he &s;hould know the accu&s;er, while he was conduct|ing him&s;elf towards him as a &s;tranger, amazed Vival|di, no le&s;s than if he had under&s;tood the character of an inqui&s;itor to be as artle&s;s as his own. On the o|ther hand he had &s;o frequently &s;een the &s;tranger at Pa|luzzi, and in the habit of a monk, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat he could hard|ly que&s;tion the a&s;&s;ertion of Schedoni, as to his identity.</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itor, addre&s;&s;ing Schedoni, &s;aid.&mdash;"Your evidence we know to be in part erroneous your ac|cu&s;er is not a monk of Naples, but a &s;ervant of the mo&s;t holy Inqui&s;ition. Judging from this part of your evidence, we mu&s;t &s;u&s;pect the whole."</P>
<P>"A &s;ervant of the Inqui&s;ition!" exclaimed Sche|doni, with unaffected &s;urprize. Reverend father! your a&s;&s;ertion a&s;toni&s;hes me! You are deceived! You doubt the cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it of my word; I, therefore, will a&s;&s;ert no more.

<P>"I have &s;een him at the ruins of Paluzzi, near Naples, and in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical dre&s;s," replied. Vi|valdi, without waiting for the regular que&s;tion, "and under circum&s;tances no le&s;s extraordinary than tho&s;e which have attended him here, But, in retur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or this frank acknowledgement, I require of you, father Sche|doni, to an&s;wer &s;ome que&s;tions which I &s;hall venture to &s;ugge&s;t to the tribunal: By what means were you informed that I have often &s;een the &s;tranger at Paluz|zi&mdash;and was you interre&s;ted or not in his my&s;terious conduct towards me there?"</P>
<P>To the&s;e que&s;tions, though formally delivered from the tribunal, Schedoni did not deign to reply.</P>
<P>"It appears, then," &s;aid the vicar-general, "that the accu&s;er and the accu&s;ed were once accomplices."</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itor objected, that this did not certainly appear; and that, on the contrary, Schedoni &s;eemed to
<PB N="200" REF="032735_0490_0FF4991CA9CFF6D8">
have given his la&s;t que&s;tions in de&s;pair; an ob&s;er|vation which Vivaldi thought extraordinary from an Inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>"Be it <HI>accomplices,</HI> if it &s;o plea&s;e you," &s;aid Schedo|ni, bowing to the grand vicar, without noticing the inqui&s;itor: you may call us accomplices&mdash;but, I &s;ay, that we were <HI>friends.</HI> Since it is nece&s;&s;ary to my own peace, that I &s;hould more fully explain &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances attending our intimacy, I will own that my accu&s;er was occa&s;ionally my agent, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in pre&s;erving the dignity of an illu&s;trious family at Na|ples, the family of the Vivaldi. And there, holy fa|ther," added Schedoni, pointing to Vincentio, "is the &s;on of that ancient hou&s;e, for whom I have attempted &s;o much!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi was almo&s;t overwhelmed by this confe&s;|&s;ion of Schedoni, though he had already &s;u&s;pected a part of the truth. In the &s;tranger he believed he &s;aw the &s;landerer of Ellena, the ba&s;e in&s;trument of the Marche&s;a's policy, and of Schedoni's ambition; and the whole of his conduct at Paluzzi, at lea&s;t, &s;eemed now intelligible. In Schedoni he beheld his &s;ecret ac|cu&s;er, and the inexorable enemy whom he believed to have occa&s;ioned the impri&s;onment of Ellena. At this latter con&s;ideration, all circum&s;pection, all prudence, for&s;ook him; he declared, with energy, that, from what Schedoni had ju&s;t acknowledged to be his con|duct, he knew him for his &s;ecret accu&s;er, and the accu&s;er al&s;o, of Ellena di Ro&s;alba; and he called upon the tribunal to examine into the Confe&s;&s;or's motives for the accu&s;ation, and afterwards to give hearing to what he would him&s;elf unfold.</P>
<P>To this the grand-vicar replied, that Vivaldi's ap|peal would be taken into con&s;ideration: and he then ordered that the pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould proceed.</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itor, addre&s;&s;ing Schedoni &s;aid,&mdash;"The di&s;intere&s;ted nature of your friend&s;hip is now &s;uffici|ently

explained, and the degree of credit, which is due to your late a&s;&s;ertions, under&s;tood.

What are your proofs, Nicola di Zampari, that he who calls him&s;elf father Schedoni is Ferando Count di Bruno; and that he has been guilty of murder, the murder of his brother, and of his wife? An&s;wer to our charge!"</P>
<P>"To your fir&s;t que&s;tion," &s;aid the monk, I reply, that he has him&s;elf acknowledged to me, on an occa|&s;ion, which it is not nece&s;&s;ary to mention, that he was the Count di Bruno; to the la&s;t, I produce the poig|dard which I received, with the dying confe&s;&s;ion of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in whom he employed."</P>
<P>"Still the&s;e are not proofs, but a&s;&s;ertions," ob&s;erv|ed the vicar-general, "and the fir&s;t forbids our con|fidence in the &s;econd.&mdash;If as you declare, Schedoni him&s;elf acknowleaged to you that he was Count di Bruno, you mu&s;t have been to him the intimate friend he has declared you were, or he would not have co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">id|ed to you a &s;ecret &s;o dangerous to him&s;elf and if you were that friend, what confidence ought we to give to your a&s;&s;ertions re&s;pecting the dagger? &s;ince, whether our accu&s;ations be true or fal&s;e, you prove your&s;elf guil|ty of treachery in bringing them forward at all.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear &s;uch candour from an Inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>"Here is my proof," &s;aid the &s;tranger, who now produced a paper containing what he a&s;&s;erted to be the dying confe&s;&s;ion of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in It was &s;igned by a prie&s;t of Rome, as well as by him&s;elf, and appeared, from the date, to have been given only a very few weeks before. The prie&s;t, he &s;aid, was living, and might be &s;ummoned. The tribunal i&s;&s;ued an order for the apprehen&s;ion of this prie&s;t, and that he &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> brought to give evidence on the following evening;

after which, the bu&s;ine&s;s of this night proceeded without further interruption, towards its conclu|&s;ion.</P>
<P>The vicar-general &s;poke again, "Nicola di Zam|pari, I call upon you to &s;ay, why, if your proof of Schedoni's guilt is &s;o clear, as the confe&s;&s;ion of the a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;in him&s;elf mu&s;t make it, why you thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;ummon father An&s;aldo to atte&s;t the crimin|ality of the Count di Bruno! the dying confe&s;&s;ion of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in is certainly of more weight than any other evidence."</P>
<P>"I &s;ummoned the father An&s;aldo," replied the &s;tranger, "as a means of proving that Schedoni is the Count di Bruno. The confe&s;&s;ion of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in &s;uf|ficiently proves the Count to have been the in&s;ti|gator of the murder, but not that Schedoni is the Count."</P>
<P>"But that is more than I will engage to prove," replied An&s;aldo. "I know it was the Count di Bruno who confe&s;&s;ed to me, but I do not know that the father Schedoni, who is now before me, was the per&s;on who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o confe&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>"Con&s;cientiou&s;ly ob&s;erved!" &s;aid the vicar-general, interruptihg the &s;tranger, who was about to reply, but you, Nicola di Zampari, have not on this head, been &s;ufficiently explicit. How do you know that Schedoni is the penitent who confe&s;&s;ed to An&s;aldo on the vigil of San Marco?"</P>
<P>"Reverend father, that is the point I was about to explain," replied the monk. "I my&s;elf accompanied Schedoni, on the eve of San Marco, to the church of the <HI>Santa Maria del Pianto,</HI> at the very hour when the confe&s;&s;ion is &s;aid to have been made. Schedoni told me he was going to confe&s;&s;ion; and, when I ob&s;erved to him his unu&s;ual agitation, his behaviour implied a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of extraordinary guilt; he even be|trayed it by &s;ome words which he dropt in the confu|&s;ion

of his mind. I parted with him at the gates of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> church. He was then of an order of white friars, and habited as father An&s;aldo has de&s;cribed. Within a few weeks after this confe&s;&s;ion, he left his convent, for what rea&s;on I never could learn, though I have of|ten &s;urmi&s;ed it, and came to re&s;ide at the &s;pirito Santo, whither I al&s;o had removed;"</P>
<P>"Here is no proof," &s;aid the vicar-general: "other friars, of that order, might confe&s;s at the &s;ame hour, in the &s;ame church."</P>
<P>"But here is a &s;trong pre&s;umption for proof," ob|&s;erved the inqui&s;itor. "Holy father, we mu&s;t judge from probabilities, as well as from proof."</P>
<P>"But probabilities them&s;elves," replied the vicar-general, "are &s;trongly again&s;t the evidence of a man, who would betray another, by means of words dropped in the ungarded moments of powerful emotion."</P>
<P>"Are the&s;e the &s;entiments of an Inqui&s;itor!" &s;aid Vivaldi to him&s;elf, "can &s;uch glorious candour ap|pear amid&s;t the tribunal of an Inqui&s;ition!" Tears fel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> fa&s;t on Vivaldi's cheek, while he gazed upon this ju&s;t judge, who&s;e candour, had it been exerted in his cau&s;e, could not have excited more powerful &s;en&s;ations of e&s;teem and admiration. "An Inqui&s;itor!" he re|peated to him&s;elf, "an Inqui&s;itor!"</P>
<P>The inferior Inqui&s;itor, howevr, was &s;o far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any congeniallity of character with his &s;u|perior, that he was evidently di&s;appointed by the ap|pearance of liberality, which the vicar-general di&s;co|vered, and immediately &s;aid, "Has the accu&s;er any thing further to urge in evidence, that the father, Sche|doni, is the penitent, who confe&s;&s;ed to the penitentia|ry An&s;aldo?"</P>
<P>"I have," replied the monk, with a&s;perity "When I had left Schedoni in the church, I lingered without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he walls for his return, according to appointment. But he appeared con&s;iderably &s;ooner than I expected,
<PB N="204" REF="032735_0494_0FF49929E6245010">
and in a &s;tate of di&s;order, &s;uch as I had never witne&s;|&s;ed in him before. In an in&s;tant he pa&s;&s;ed me, nor could my voice arre&s;t his progre&s;s.

It has &s;ince appeared, that the monks were then &s;earching for the penitent. A rumour afterwards reached me, that a confe&s;&s;ion had cau&s;ed this di&s;turbance; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat the father-confe&s;&s;or, who happened at that time to be the grand penitenti|ary An&s;aldo, had left the chair in horror of what had been divulged from the grate, and had judged it ne|ce&s;&s;ary that a &s;earch &s;hould be made for the penitent. who was a white friar. This report, reverend fathers, excited general attention; with me it did more&mdash;for I thought I knew the penitent. When on the fol|lowing day, I que&s;tioned Schedoni as to his &s;udden de|parture from the Black Penitents, his an&s;wers were dark, but emphatic, and he extorted from me a pro|mi&s;e, thoughtle&s;s that I was! never to di&s;clo&s;e his vi&s;it of the preceeding evening to the <HI>Santa del Pian|to.</HI> I then certainly di&s;covered who was the penitent,"</P>
<P>"Did he, then confe&s;s to you al&s;o?" &s;aid the vicar-general.</P>
<P>"No father. I under&s;tood him to be the penitent to whom the report alluded, but I had no &s;u&s;picion of the nature of his crimes, till the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in began his confe&s;&s;ion, the conclu&s;ion of which clearly explained the &s;ubject of Schedoni's; it explained al&s;o his motive for endeavouring ever after to attach me to his inter|e&s;t."</P>
<P>"You have now, &s;aid the Vicar-general," you have now confe&s;&s;ed your&s;elf a member of the covent of the Spirito Santo at Naples, and an intimate of the father Schedoni; one whom for many years he has endea|voured to attach to him. Not an hour has pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince
<PB N="205" REF="032735_0495_0FF46EDDAAA8A398">
you denied all this; the negative to the latter circum|&s;tance was given, it is true, by implication only; but to the fir&s;t, a direct and ab&s;olute denial was pronounc|ed!"</P>
<P>"I denied that I <HI>am</HI> a monk of Naples," replied the accu&s;er, "and I appealed to the Inqui&s;itor for the truth of my denial. He has &s;aid, that I am now a &s;ervant of the mo&s;t holy Inqui&s;ition."</P>
<P>The vicar-general, with &s;ome &s;urprize, looked at the Inqui&s;itor for explanation, other members of the tribunal did the &s;ame; the re&s;t appeared to under&s;tand more than they had thought it nece&s;&s;ary to avow. The Inqui&s;itor&mdash;who had been called upon, ro&s;e, and re|plied.</P>
<P>"Nichola di Zampari has &s;poken the truth. It is not many weeks &s;ince he entered the holy office. A certificate from his convent at Naples bears te&s;timony to the truth of what I advance, and procured him ad|mittance here."</P>
<P>"It is extraordinary, that you &s;hould not have di&s;|clo&s;ed your knowledge of this per&s;on before!" &s;aid the vickar general.</P>
<P>"Holy father, I had rea&s;ons," replied the Inqui|&s;itor, "you will recollect that the accu&s;ed was pre|&s;ent, and you will under&s;tand them."</P>
<P>"I comprehend you, &s;aid the vicar-general, "but I do neither approve of, nor perceive any nece&s;&s;ity for your countenancing the &s;ubterfuge of this Nicola di Zampari, relative to his identity. But more of this in private."</P>
<P>"I will explain all there," an&s;wered the Inqui&s;itor.</P>
<P>"It appears then" re&s;umed the vicar-general, &s;peaking aloud, "that this Nicola di Zampari was for|merly the friend and confidant of father Schedoni, whom he now accu&s;es. The accu&s;ation is evidently malicious; whether it be al&s;o fal&s;e, remains to be decided. A material que&s;tion naturally ari&s;es out of
<PB N="206" REF="032735_0496_0FF4992B6C6C2588">
the &s;ubject&mdash;Why was not the accu&s;ation brought forward before this period?"</P>
<P>The monk's vi&s;age brightened with the &s;atis|faction of anticipated triumph, and he immediately re|plied.</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t holy father! as &s;oon as I a&s;certained the crime, I prepared to pro&s;ecute the perpetrator of it&mdash;A &s;hort period only has elap&s;ed &s;ince the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in gave his confe&s;&s;ion. In this interval I di&s;covered, in the&s;e pri&s;ons, Signor Vivaldi, and immediately compre|hended by who&s;e means he was confined. I knew enough both of the accu&s;er and the accu&s;ed, to under|&s;tand which of the&s;e was innocent, and had then a double motive for cau&s;ing Schedoni to be &s;ummoned;&mdash;I wi&s;hed equally to deliver the innocent and puni&s;h the criminal. The que&s;tion as to the mo|tive for my becoming the enemy of him, who was once my friend, is already an&s;wered: it was a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, not a &s;ugge&s;tion of malice."</P>
<P>The grand-vicar &s;miled, but a&s;ked no further; and this long examination concluded with committing Schedoni again into clo&s;e cu&s;tody, till full evidence &s;hould be obtained of his guilt, or his innocence &s;hould appear. Re&s;pecting the manner of his wife's death, there was yet no other evidence than that which was a&s;&s;erted to be his own confe&s;&s;ion, which though perhaps &s;ufficient to condemn a criminal before the tribunal of the Inqui&s;ition, was not enough to &s;atisfy the pre&s;ent vicar-general, who gave direction, that means might be employed towards obtaining proof of each article of the accu&s;ation; in order that, Sche|doni be acquitted of the charge of having murdered his brother, documents might appear for pro&s;ecuting him re&s;pecting the death of his wife.</P>
<P>Schedoni, when he withdrew from the hall, bowed re&s;pectfully to the tribunal, and whether, notwith|&s;tanding late appearances, he were innocent, or that

&s;ubtlety enable him to re-a&s;&s;ume his u&s;ual addre&s;s, it is certain his manner no longer betrayed any &s;ymptom of con&s;cious guilt. His countenance was firm and even tranquil, and his air dignified. Vivaldi, who, during the greater part of this examination, had been convinced of his criminality, now only doubted his innocence. Vivaldi was him&s;elf reconducted to his pri&s;on, and the fitting of the tribunal was di&s;&s;olved.</P>

<P>WHEN the night of Schedoni's trial arrived, Vivaldi was again &s;ummoned to the hall of the tribu|nal. Every circum&s;tance was now arranged accord|ing to the full ceremonies of the place; the members of the tribunal were more numerous than formerly at the examinations; the chief inqui&s;itors wore habits of a fa&s;hion different from tho&s;e, which before di&s;|tingui&s;hed them, and their turbans, of a &s;ingular form and larger &s;ize, &s;eemed to give an air of &s;terner fero|city to their features. The hall, as u&s;ual, was hung with black, and&punc; every per&s;on who appeared there, whether inqui&s;itor, official, witne&s;s or pri&s;oner, was habited in the &s;ame di&s;mal hue, which together with the kind of light diffu&s;ed through the chamber from lamps hung high in the vaulted roof, and from torches held by parties of officials who kept watch at the &s;e|veral doors, and in different parts of this immen&s;e hall, gave a character of gloomy &s;olemnity to the a&s;&s;embly, which was almo&s;t horrofic.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was &s;ituated in a place, whence he beheld the whole of the tribunal, and could di&s;tingui&s;h what|ever was pa&s;&s;ing in the hall. The countenance of every member was now fully di&s;played to him by the torchmen, who, arranged at the &s;teps of the platform on which the three chief inqui&s;itors were elevated, ex|tended
<PB N="209" REF="032735_0499_0FF46EE0CD428030">
in a &s;emicircle on either hand of the place oc|cupied by the inferior members. The red glare, which the torches threw upon the latter, certainly did not &s;often the expre&s;&s;ion of faces, for the mo&s;t part &s;culptured by pa&s;&s;ions of dark malignity, or fiercer cruelty? and Vivaldi could not bear even to examine them long.</P>
<P>Before the bar of the tribunal, he di&s;tingui&s;hed Schedoni, and little did he &s;u&s;pect that in him, a cri|minal brought thither to an&s;wer for the guilt of mur|der&mdash;the murder of a brother, and of a wife, he be|held the parent of Ellena di Ro&s;alba!</P>
<P>Near Schedoni was &s;eated the penitentiary An&s;al|do: the Roman prie&s;t, who was to be a principal wit|ne&s;s, and father Nicola di Zampari, upon whom Vi|valdi could not even now look without experiencing &s;ome what of the awe, which had prevailed over his mind when he was inclined to con&s;ider the &s;tranger, rather as the vi&s;ion of another world, than as a being of this. The &s;ame wild and inde&s;cribable character &s;till di&s;tingui&s;hed his air, his very look and movement, and Vivaldi could not but believe that &s;omething in the highe&s;t degree extraordinary would yet be di&s;co|vered concerning him.</P>
<P>The witne&s;&s;es being called over, Vivaldi under|&s;tood the he was placed among them, though he had only repeated the words which father Nicola had &s;po|ken, and which, &s;ince Nicola him&s;elf was pre&s;ent as a witne&s;s again&s;t Schedoni, he did not perceive could be in the lea&s;t material on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he trial.</P>
<P>When Vivaldi had, in his turn, an&s;wered to his name, a voice, bur&s;ting forth from a &s;ti&s;tant part of the hall, exclaimed, "It is my ma&s;ter! my <HI>dear</HI> ma&s;|ter!" and on directing his eyes whence it came, he perceived the faithful Paulo &s;truggling with his guard. Vivaldi called to him to be patient, and to forbear re|&s;i&s;tance, an exhortation, however, which &s;erved only
<PB N="210" REF="032735_0500_0FF4992E74F2C770">
to increa&s;e the efforts of the &s;ervant for liberty, and in the next in&s;tant he broke from the gra&s;p of the offi|cials, and darting towards Vivaldi, fell at his feet, &s;ob|bing, and cla&s;ping his knees, and exclaiming, "O my ma&s;ter! my ma&s;ter! have I found you at la&s;t?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi, much affected by this meeting as Paulo, could not immediately &s;peak. He would, however, have rai&s;ed and embraced his affectionate &s;ervant, but Paulo, &s;till clinging to his knees and &s;obbing, was &s;o much agitated that he &s;carcely under&s;tood any thing &s;aid to him, and to the kind a&s;&s;urances and gentle re|mon&s;trances of Vivaldi con&s;tantly replied as if to the officers, whom he fancied to be forcing him away.</P>
<P>"Remember your &s;ituation, Paulo," &s;aid Vivaldi, "con&s;ider mine al&s;o, and be governed by prudence."</P>
<P>"You &s;hall not force me hence!" cried Paulo, "you can take my life only once; if I mu&s;t die, it &s;hall be here."</P>
<P>"Recollect your&s;elf, Paulo, and he compo&s;ed. Your life, I tru&s;t, is in no danger."</P>
<P>Paulo looked up, and again, bur&s;ting into a pa&s;&s;ion of tears, repeated, "O! my ma&s;ter! my ma&s;ter! where have you been all this while? are you indeed alive? I thought I never &s;hould &s;ee you again! I have dreamt an hundred times that you were dead and bu|ried! and I wi&s;hed to be dead and buried with you. I thought you was gone out of this world into the next. I feared you was gone to heaven, and &s;o be|lieved we &s;hould never meet again. But now, I &s;ee you once more, and know that you live! O! my ma&s;ter! my ma&s;ter!"</P>
<P>The officers who had followed Paulo, now en|deavouring to withdraw him, he became more outra|geous.</P>
<P>"Do your wor&s;t at once," &s;aid Paulo, "but you &s;hall find tough work of it, if you try to force me from
<PB N="211" REF="032735_0501_0FF498D1A32C7C70">
hence; &s;o you had better be contented with killing me here."</P>
<P>The incen&s;ed officials were laying violent hands upon him, when Vivaldi interpo&s;ed. "I entreat, I &s;upplicate you, &s;aid he, "that you will &s;uffer him to remain near me."</P>
<P>"It is impo&s;&s;ible," replied an officer, "we dare not."</P>
<P>"I will promi&s;e that he &s;hall not even &s;peak to me, if you will allow him to be near," added Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Not &s;peak to you, ma&s;ter!" exclaimed Paulo, "but I will &s;tay by you, and &s;peak to you as long as I like, till my la&s;t ga&s;p. Let them do their wor&s;t at once; I defy them all, and all the devils of inqui&s;itors it their heels too, to force me away. I can die but once, and they ought to be &s;atisfied with that,&mdash;&s;o what is there to be afraid of? Not &s;peak!</P>
<P>"He knows not what he &s;ays," &s;aid Vivaldi to the officials, while he endeavoured to &s;ilence Paulo with his hand: "I am certain that he will &s;ubmit to what|ever I &s;hall require of him, and will be entirely &s;i|lent; or if he does &s;peak now and then, it &s;hall be only in a whi&s;per."</P>
<P>"A whi&s;per!" &s;aid an officer, &s;neeringly, "do you &s;uppo&s;e, Signor, that any per&s;on is &s;uffered to &s;peak in a whi&s;per here?"</P>
<P>"A whi&s;per!" &s;houted Paulo, "I &s;corn to &s;peak in a whi&s;per. I will &s;peak &s;o loud, that every word I &s;ay &s;hall ring in the ears of all the&s;e old black devils on the benches yonder; aye, and tho&s;e on that moun|tebank &s;tage too, that &s;it there looking &s;o grim and an|gry as if they longed to tear us in pieces. They"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Silence," &s;aid Vivaldi, with empha&s;is: "Paulo, I command you to be &s;ilent."</P>
<P>"They &s;hall know a bit of my mind," continued Paulo, without noticing Vivaldi: "I will tell them what they have to expect for all their cruel u&s;age of
<PB N="212" REF="032735_0502_0FF499389842C8F0">
my poor ma&s;ter. Where do they expect to go when they die. I wonder? though for that matter, they can|not go to a wor&s;e place than they are in already, and I &s;uppo&s;e it is, knowing that, which makes them not af|fraid of being ever &s;o wicked. They &s;hall hear a lit|tle plain truth, for once in their lives, however, they &s;hall hear"&mdash;</P>
<P>During the whole of this harangue, Vivaldi, a|larmed for the con&s;equence of &s;uch imprudent, though hone&s;t indignation, had been u&s;ing all po&s;&s;ible, effort to &s;ilence him, and was the more alarmed, &s;ince the officials made no further attempt to interrupt Paulo, a forbearance, which Vivaldi attributed to malignity, and to a wi&s;h that Paulo might be entrapped by his own act. At length, he made him&s;elf heard.</P>
<P>"I <HI>entreat,</HI>" &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>Paulo &s;topped for a moment.</P>
<P>"Paulo!" rejoined Vivaldi, earne&s;tly; "do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> love your ma&s;ter?"</P>
<P>"Love my ma&s;ter!" &s;aid Paulo re&s;entfully, without allowing Vivaldi to fini&s;h his &s;entence, "Have I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gone through fire and water for him? or, what is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> good, have I not put my&s;elf into the Inqui&s;ition, and all on his account? and now to be a&s;ked, "Do I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my ma&s;ter!" If you believe, Signor, that any thing, el&s;e made me come here, into the&s;e di&s;mal holes, you are quite entirely out; and when they have made an end of me, as I &s;uppo&s;e they will do, before all is o|ver, you will, perhaps, think better of me than to &s;u&s;|pect that I came here for my own plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>'All that may be as you &s;ay, Paulo,' replied Vivaldi coldly, while he, with difficulty, commanded his tears "but your immediate &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is the only conduct that can convince me of the &s;incerity of your profe&s;|&s;ions. I <HI>entreat</HI> you to be &s;ilent."</P>
<P>"<HI>Entreat</HI> me!" &s;aid Paulo, "O my ma&s;ter! what
<PB N="213" REF="032735_0503_0FF498D3292589F0">
have I done that it &s;hould come to this? <HI>Entreat</HI> me!" he repeated, &s;obbing.</P>
<P>"You will then give me this proof of your attach|ment?" a&s;ked Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Do not u&s;e &s;uch a heart-breaking word again, ma&s;ter," replied Paulo, while he da&s;hed the tears from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cheek, "&s;uch a heart-breaking word, and I will do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thing."</P>
<P>"You &s;ubmit to what I require then, Paulo?"</P>
<P>"Aye, Signor, if&mdash;if it is even to kneel, at the feet of that devil of an Inqui&s;itor, yonder."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall only require you to be &s;ilent," replied Vi|valdi, "and you may then be permitted to remain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me."</P>
<P>"Well, Signor, well; I will do as you bid me, then, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> only ju&s;t &s;ay"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Not a &s;yllable! Paulo," interrupted Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Only ju&s;t &s;ay, ma&s;ter"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Not a word, I entreat you!" added Vivaldi, "or you will be removed immediately."</P>
<P>"His removal does not depend on that," &s;aid one of the officials, breaking from his watchful &s;ilence he mu&s;t go, and that without more delay."</P>
<P>"What! after I have promi&s;ed not to open my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">!" &s;aid Paulo, "do you pretend to break your a|greement?"</P>
<P>"There <HI>is</HI> no pretence, and there <HI>was</HI> no agree|ment," replied the man &s;harply, "&s;o obey directly, or will be the wor&s;e for you."</P>
<P>The officials were provoked, and Paulo became <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> more enraged and clamorous, till, at length, the roar reached the tribunal, at the other end of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and &s;ilence having been commanded, an in|&s;piry was made into the cau&s;e of the confu&s;ion. The con&s;equence of this was, an order that Paulo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould withdraw from Vivaldi; but, as at this mo|ment, he feared no greater evil, he gave his refu&s;al
<PB N="214" REF="032735_0504_0FF4993A1E60D330">
to the tribunal with as little ceremony as he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> before to the officials.</P>
<P>At length, after much difficulty, a &s;ort of compro|mi&s;e was made, and Paulo being &s;oothed by his ma&s;ter into &s;ome degree of compliance, was &s;uffered to remain within a &s;hort di&s;tance of him.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the trial &s;oon after commence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. An&s;aldo, the penitentiary, and father Nicola, appeared as witne&s;&s;es, as did, al&s;o the Roman prie&s;t, who ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a&s;&s;i&s;ted in taking the depo&s;itions of the dying a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. He had been privately interrogated, and had given clear and &s;atisfactory evidence as to the truth of the paper produced by Nicola. Other witne&s;&s;es, al&s;o, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> been &s;ubpoenaed, whom Schedoni had no expection a meeting.</P>
<P>The deportment of the Confe&s;&s;or, on fir&s;t entering the hall, was collected and firm; it remained unchanged when the Roman prie&s;t was brought forward; but, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the appearance of another witne&s;s his courage &s;eem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to faulter. Before this evidence was however, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for, the depo&s;itions of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in were publicly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. They &s;tated, with the clo&s;e&s;t conci&s;ene&s;s, the chief fact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of which the following as a &s;omewhat more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> narrative.</P>
<P>It appeared, that about the year 1742, the late Count di Bruno had pa&s;&s;ed over into Greece, a journey which his brother, the pre&s;ent Confe&s;&s;or, having long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|pected, had meditated to take advantage of. Though a lawle&s;s pa&s;&s;ion had fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted to the dark <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of Schedoni, the atrocious act, which &s;hould de&s;troy brother, many circum&s;tances and con&s;iderations he con&s;pired to urge him towards its accompli&s;h|ment. Among the&s;e was the conduct of the law Count towards him&s;elf. which however rea&s;onable as it had contradicted his own &s;elfi&s;h gratification and added &s;trong reproof to oppo&s;ition, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his mo&s;t inveterate hatred. Schedoni, who, as younger brother of his family, bore, at that time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="215" REF="032735_0505_0FF498DD10DE09F8">
title of Count di Marinella, had di&s;&s;ipated his &s;mall patrimony at a very early age; but, though, &s;uffering, might then have taught him prudence, it had only en|couraged him in duplicity, and rendered him more ea|ger to &s;eek a temporary refuge in the &s;ame habits of extravagance which had led to it. The Count di Bruno, though his fortune was very limited, had af|forded frequent &s;upplies to his brother; till, finding that he was incorrigible, and that the &s;ums which he him&s;elf &s;pared with difficulty from his family were wi&s;hed, without remor&s;e, by Marinella, in&s;tead of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eing applied, with economy, to his &s;upport, he re|fu&s;ed further aid than was &s;ufficient for his ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>It would be difficult for a candid mind to believe how a conduct &s;o rea&s;onable could po&s;&s;ibly excite hatred in any brea&s;t, or that the power of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s could &s;o far warp any under&s;tanding, as to induce Marinella, whom we will, in future again call Sche|doni, to look upon his brother with dete&s;tation, becau&s;e he had refu&s;ed to ruin him&s;elf that his kin&s;man might level! Yet it is certain that Schedoni, terming the nece&s;&s;ary prudence of di Bruno to be meanne&s;s and cold in&s;en&s;ibility to the comfort of others, &s;uffered full as much re&s;entment towards him from &s;y&s;tem, as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from pa&s;&s;ion, though the meanne&s;s and the in&s;en&s;i|bility he imagined in his brother's character were not only real traits in his own, but were di&s;playing them|&s;elves in the very arguments he urged again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The rancour this excited was cheri&s;hed by innu|merable circum&s;tances, and ripened by envy, that meane&s;t and mo&s;t maligment of the human pa&s;&s;ions; by envy of di Bruno's ble&s;&s;ings, of an unencumbered e&s;tate, and, of a beautiful wife, he was tempted to per|petrate the deed, which might transfer the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o him&s;elf. Spalatro, whom he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to this pur|po&s;e, was well known to him, and he did not fear to
<PB N="216" REF="032735_0506_0FF4993BA5183358">
confide the conduct or the crime to this man, who was to purcha&s;e a little habitation on the remote she of the Adriatic, and, with a certain &s;tipend, to re&s;ide there. The ruinous dwelling, to which Ellena had been carried, as its &s;olitary &s;ituation &s;uited Schedoni's views, was taken for him.</P>
<P>Schedoni, who had good intelligence of all di Bru|no's movement, acquainted Spalatro, from time to time with his exact &s;ituation; and it was after di Bruno, on his return, had cro&s;&s;ed the Adriatic, from Ragu&s;i to Manfredonia, and was entering upon the woods of the Garganus, that Spalatro, with his comrade overtook him. They fired at the Count and his attendants, who were only a valet, and a guide of the country<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and concealed among the thickets, they &s;ecurely re|peated the attack. The &s;hot did not immediately &s;ucceed, and the Count, looking round to di&s;cover his enemy, prepared to defend him&s;elf, but the firing was &s;o rapidly &s;u&s;tained, that, at length, both di Bruno and his &s;ervant fell, covered with wounds. The guide fled.</P>
<P>The unfortunate travellers were buried by their a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ins on the &s;pot; but, whether the &s;u&s;picion which attends upon the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt prompted Spa|latro to guard again&s;t every po&s;&s;ibility of being be|trayed by the accomplice of his crime, or whatever was the motive, he returned to the fore&s;t alone; and, &s;hrouded by night, removed the bodies to a pit, which he had prepared under the flooring of the hou&s;e where he lived; thus di&s;placing all proof, &s;hould his accom|plice hereafter point out to ju&s;tice the &s;pot in which he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted to depo&s;it the mangled remains of di Bruno.</P>
<P>Schedoni contrived a plau&s;ible hi&s;tory of the &s;hip|wreck of his brother upon the Adriatic, and of the lo&s;s of the whole crew; and, as no per&s;ons but the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins were acquainted with the real cau&s;e of his death, the
<PB N="217" REF="032735_0507_0FF498DE978EF9B0">
guide, who had fled, and the people at the only town he had pa&s;&s;ed through, &s;ince he landed, being igno|rant even of the name of di Bruno, there was not any circum&s;tance to contradict the fal&s;hood. It was uni|ver&s;ally credited, and even the widow of the Count had, perhaps, never doubted its truth; or if, after her com|pelled marriage with Schedoni, his conduct did awaken a &s;u&s;picion, it was too vague to produce any &s;erious con&s;equence.</P>
<P>During the reading of Spalatro's confe&s;&s;ion, and par|ticularly at the conclu&s;ion of it, the &s;urprize and di&s;|may of Schedoni were too powerful for concealment; and it was not the lea&s;t con&s;iderable part of his won|der, that Spalatro &s;hould have come to Rome for the purpo&s;e of making the&s;e depo&s;itions; but further con|&s;ideration gave him a conjecture of the truth.</P>
<P>The account, which Spalatro had given of his mo|tive for this journey to the prie&s;t, was, that, having lately under&s;tood Schedoni to be re&s;ident at Rome, he had followed him thither, with an intention of reliev|ing his con&s;cience by an acknowledgment of his own crimes, and a di&s;clo&s;ure of Schedoni's. This, however, was not exactly the fact. The de&s;ign of Spalatro was to extort money from the guilty Confe&s;&s;or; a de&s;ign, from which the latter beleived he had protected him|&s;elf, as well as from every other evil con&s;equence, when he mi&s;&s;ed his late accomplice, re&s;pecting his place of re&s;idence; little fore&s;eeing that the very artifice, which &s;hould &s;end this man in &s;earch of him to Rome, in|&s;tead of Naples, would be the means of bringing his crimes before the public.</P>
<P>Spalatro had followed the &s;teps of Schedoni as far as the town at which he &s;teps, on the fir&s;t night of his journey; and, having there pa&s;&s;ed him, had reached the villa di Cambru&s;ca, when, perceiving the Confe&s;&s;or approaching, he had taken &s;helter from ob&s;ervation, within the ruin. The motive, which before made
<PB N="218" REF="032735_0508_0FF4993D2A7AE0C0">
him &s;hrink from notice, had contributed, and &s;till did &s;o, to a &s;u&s;picion that he aimed at the life of Sche|doni, who in wounding him, believed he had &s;aved him&s;elf from an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. The wounds, however, of Spalatro did not &s;o much di&s;able him, but that he pro|ceeded towards Rome from the town whence the parting road had conducted his ma&s;ter towards Na|ples.</P>
<P>The fatigue of a long journey, performed chiefly on foot, in Spalatro's wounded condition, occa&s;ioned a fever, that terminated together his journey and his life; and in his la&s;t hours he had unburdened his con&s;cience by a full confe&s;&s;ion of his guilt. The prie&s;t, who, on this occa&s;ion, had been &s;ent for alarmed by the im|portance of the confe&s;&s;ion, &s;ince it implicated a living per&s;on, called in a friend as witne&s;s to the depo&s;itions This witne&s;s was father Nicola, the former intimate of Schedoni, and who was of a character to rejoice in any di&s;covery, which might puni&s;h a man from who&s;e repeated promi&s;es he had received only &s;evere di&s;ap|pointments.</P>
<P>Schedoni now perceived that all his de&s;igns again&s;t Spalatro had failed, and he had meditated more than have yet been fully di&s;clo&s;ed. It may be remembered, that on parting with the pea&s;ant, his conductor, the Confe&s;&s;or, gave him a &s;tiletto to defend him, as he &s;aid, from the attack of Spalatro, in ca&s;e of encounter|ing him on the road. The point of this in&s;trument was tipped with poi&s;on; &s;o that a &s;cratch from it was &s;ufficient to inflict death. Schedoni had, for many years &s;ecretly carried about him &s;uch an envenomed in&s;trument, for rea&s;ons known only to him&s;elf. He had hoped, that, &s;hould the pea&s;ant meet Spalatra, and he provoked to defend him&s;elf, this &s;tiletto would ter|minate the life of his accomplice, and relieve him from all probability of di&s;covery, &s;ince the other a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, whom he employed, had been dead &s;everal years. The
<PB N="219" REF="032735_0509_0FF498E01EEF8A58">
expedient failed in every re&s;pect; the pea&s;ant did not even &s;ee Spalatro; and, before he reached his home, he luckily lo&s;t the fatal &s;tiletto, which, as he had di&s;co|vered him&s;elf to be acquainted with &s;ome circum&s;tances connected with the crimes of Schedoni, the Confe&s;&s;or would have wi&s;hed him to keep, from the chance, that he might &s;ome time injure him&s;elf in u&s;ing it. The poignard, as he had no proper means of fa&s;tening it to his dre&s;s, had fallen, and was carried away by the tor|rent he was cro&s;&s;ing at that moment.</P>
<P>But, if Schedoni had been &s;hocked by the confe&s;&s;ion of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, his di&s;may was con&s;iderably greater, when a new witne&s;s was brought forward, and he per|ceived an ancient dome&s;tic of his hou&s;e. This man identified Schedoni for Ferando Count di Bruno, with whom he had lived as a &s;ervant after the death of the Count his brother. And not only did he bear te&s;ti|mony to the per&s;on of Schedoni, but to the death of the Counte&s;s, his wife. Giovanni declared him&s;elf to be one of the dome&s;tics who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in convey|ing her to her apartment, after &s;he had been &s;truck by the poignard of Schedoni, and who had afterwards at|tended her funeral in the church of the Santa del Mir|acoli, a convent near the late re&s;idence of di Bruno. He further affirmed, that the phy&s;icians had reported her death to be in con&s;equence of the wound &s;he had received, and he bore witne&s;s to the flight of his ma|&s;ter, previous to the death of the Counte&s;s, and im|mediately upon the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, and that he had never publicly appeared upon his e&s;tate &s;ince that period.</P>
<P>An inqui&s;itor a&s;ked, whether any mea&s;ures had been taken by the relations of the decea&s;ed lady toward a pro&s;ecution of the Count.</P>
<P>The witne&s;s replied, that a long &s;earch had been made for the Count, for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, but that he had wholly eluded di&s;covery, and that, of cour&s;e, no fur|ther
<PB N="220" REF="032735_0510_0FF49946F7238A20">
&s;tep had been taken in the affair. This reply ap|peared to occa&s;ion di&s;&s;atisfaction;&mdash;the tribunal was &s;ilent, and &s;eemed to he&s;itate: the vicar-general then addre&s;&s;ed the witne&s;s.</P>
<P>"How can you be certain that the per&s;on now be|fore you, calling him&s;elf father Schedoni, is the Count di Bruno, your former ma&s;ter, if you have never &s;een him during the long interval of years you mention?"</P>
<P>Giovanni, without he&s;itation, an&s;wered,&mdash;that though years had worn the features of the Count he re|collected them the moment he beheld him; and not the Count only, but the per&s;on of the penitentiary An&s;aldo, whom he had &s;een a frequent vi&s;iter at the hou&s;e of di Bruno, though his appearance, al&s;o, was con&s;iderably changed by time, and by the eccle&s;ia&s;tical habit which he now wore.</P>
<P>The vicar-general &s;eemed &s;till to doubt the evi|dence of this man, till An&s;aldo him&s;elf, on being call|ed upon remembered him to have been a &s;ervant of the Count, though he could not identify the Count him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The grand inqui&s;itor remarked, that it was extra|ordinary he &s;hould recollect the face of the &s;ervant, yet forget that of the ma&s;ter, with whom he had liv|ed in habits of intimacy. To this An&s;aldo replied, that the &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ions of Schedoni, together with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> particular habits of life, might rea&s;onably be &s;up|po&s;ed to have wrought a greater change upon the fea|tures of the Count than the character and circum|&s;tances of Giovanni's could have effected on his.</P>
<P>Schedoni, not without rea&s;on, was appalled, on the appearance of this &s;ervant, who&s;e further te&s;timony gave &s;uch clearne&s;s and force to &s;ome other parts of the evi|dence, that the tribunal pronounced &s;entence upon Schedoni, as the murderer of the Count his brother; and as this, the fir&s;t charge, was &s;ufficient for his con|demnation to death, they did not proceed upon the &s;e|cond, that which related to his wife.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="032735_0511_0FF498E1AA699310">
The emotion betrayed by Schedoni on the appear|ance of the la&s;t witne&s;s, and during the delivery of the evidence, di&s;appeared when his fate became certain; and when the dreadful &s;entence of the law was pro|nounced, it made no vi&s;ible impre&s;&s;ion on his mind.

<P>Vivaldi, who witne&s;&s;ed his condemnation, appeared infinitely more affected by it than him&s;elf, and, though in revealing the circum&s;tance of father Nicola's &s;um|mons, which had eventually led to the di&s;covery of Schedoni's crimes, he had not been left a choice in his conduct, he felt, at this moment, as mi&s;erable as if he had actually borne witne&s;s again&s;t the life of a fellow being: what, then, would have been his feelings, had he been told that this Schedoni, thus condemned, was the father of Ellena di Ro&s;alba! But, whatever the&s;e might be, he was &s;oon condemned to experience them. One of the mo&s;t powerful of Schedoni's pa&s;&s;ions ap|peared even in this la&s;t &s;cene; and as, in quitting the tribunal, he pa&s;&s;ed near Vivaldi he uttered the&s;e words&mdash;"In me you have murdered the father of Ellena di Ro&s;alba!</P>
<P>Not with any hope that the interce&s;&s;ion of Vivaldi, him&s;elf al&s;o a pri&s;oner, could in the lea&s;t mitigate a &s;entence pronounced by the Inqui&s;ition, did he &s;ay this, but for the purpo&s;e of revenging him&s;elf for the evil, which Vivaldi's evidence had contributed to produce, and inflicting the exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery &s;uch information mu&s;t give. The attempt &s;ucceeded too well.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, indeed, Vivaldi judged this to be only the de&s;perate a&s;&s;ertion of a man, who believed his la&s;t chance of e&s;caping the rigour of the law to re&s;t with him; and, at the mention of Ellena, forgetting every precaution, he loudly demanded to know her &s;ituation. Schedoni, throwing upon him an horrible &s;mile of tri|umph and deri&s;ion, was pa&s;&s;ing forward without
<PB N="222" REF="032735_0512_0FF49948827F8E90">
re|plying, but Vivaldi, unable to &s;upport this &s;tate of uncertainty, a&s;ked permi&s;&s;ion, of the tribunal to con|ver&s;e a few mements, with the pri&s;oner; a reque&s;t which was granted with extreme reluctance, and only on condition that the conver&s;ation &s;hould be public.</P>
<P>To Vivaldi's que&s;tions, as to the &s;ituation of Elle|na, Schedoni only replied, that &s;he was his daughter, and the &s;olemnity, which accompanied the&s;e repeated a&s;&s;ertions, though it failed to convince Vivaldi of this truth, occa&s;ioned him agonizing doubt and apprehen|&s;ion; but when the Confe&s;&s;or, perceiving the policy of di&s;clo&s;ing her place of re&s;idence to Vivaldi, &s;oftened from his de&s;ire of vengeance of &s;ecure the intere&s;t of his family, and named the <HI>Santa della Pieta</HI> as her pre&s;ent a&s;ylum, the joy of &s;uch intelligence overcame for a &s;hort time, every other con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>To this dialogue, however, the officials put a &s;pee|dy conclu&s;ion; Schedoni was led back to his cell, and Vivaldi was &s;oon after ordered to his former clo&s;e con|finement.</P>
<P>But Paulo became again outrageous, when he was about to be &s;eparated from his ma&s;ter, till the latter, having petitioned the tribunal, that his &s;ervant might accompany him to his pri&s;on, and received an ab&s;o|lute refu&s;al, endeavoured to calm the violence of his de&s;pair. He fell at his ma&s;ter's feet, and &s;hed tears, but he uttered no further complaints. When he ro&s;e he turned his eyes in &s;ilence upon Vivaldi, and they &s;eemed to &s;ay "Dear ma&s;ter! I &s;hall never &s;ee you more!" and with this &s;ad expre&s;&s;ion, he continued to gaze on him till he had left the hall.</P>
<P>Vivaldi notwith&s;tanding the various &s;ubjects of his di&s;tre&s;s, could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> bear to meet the piteous looks of this poor man, and he withdrew his eyes; yet, at every o|ther &s;tep he took, they con&s;tantly returned to his faith|ful &s;ervant, till the doors folded him from &s;ight.</P>
<P>When he had quitted the hull, Vivaldi pleaded,
<PB N="223" REF="032735_0513_0FF498EB50750EF8">
however hopele&s;sly, to the officials, in favour of Paulo, entreating that they would &s;peak to the per&s;ons who kept guard over him, and prevail with them to &s;hew him every allowable indulgence.</P>
<P>"No indulgence can be allowed him," replied one of the men, "except bread and water, and the liberty of walking in his cell."</P>
<P>"No <HI>other!</HI>" &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"None," repeated the official. "This pri&s;oner has been near getting one of his guards into a &s;crape already, for, &s;omehow or other, he &s;o talked him over, and won upon him, (for he is but a young one here) that the man let him have a light, and a pen and ink; but luckily, it was found out before any harm was done."</P>
<P>"And what became of this hone&s;t; fellow?" inqui|red Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Hone&s;t! he was none &s;o hone&s;t, either Signor, if he could not mind his duty."</P>
<P>"Was he puni&s;hed, then?"</P>
<P>"No, Signor," replied the man, pau&s;ing, and look|ing back upon the long avenue they were pa&s;&s;ing, to inquire whether he was ob&s;erved to hold this conver|&s;ation with a pri&s;oner: "no, Signor, he was a younk|er, &s;o they let him off for once, and &s;ent him to guard a man, who was not &s;o full of his coaxing ways."</P>
<P>"Paulo made him merry, perhaps?" a&s;ked Vi|valdi. "What were the coaxing ways you &s;poke of?"</P>
<P>"Merry, Signor! no! he made him cry, and that was as bad."</P>
<P>"Indeed!" &s;aid Vivaldi, "The man mu&s;t have been here, than, a very &s;hort time."</P>
<P>"Not more than a month, or &s;o, Signor."</P>
<P>"But the coaxing ways you talked of," repeated Vivaldi, "what were they;&mdash;a ducat, or &s;o?"</P>
<P>"A ducat!" exclaimed the man, "no! not a <HI>Poolo!</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="032735_0514_0FF4994A078A9678">
"Are you <HI>&s;ure</HI> of that? cried Vivaldi, &s;hrewdly.</P>
<P>"Aye, &s;ure enough, Signor. This fellow is not worth a ducat in the world!"</P>
<P>"But his ma&s;ter is friend," ob&s;erved Vivaldi, in a very low voice, while he put &s;ome money into his hand.</P>
<P>The officer made no an&s;wer, but concealed the mo|ney, and nothing further was &s;aid.</P>
<P>Vivaldi had given this as a bribe to procure &s;ome kindne&s;s for his &s;ervant, not from any con&s;ideration of him&s;elf, for his own critical &s;ituation had cea&s;ed at this time to be a &s;ubject of anxiety with him. His mind was at pre&s;ent &s;trangely agitated between emotions the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite in their nature, the joy which a di&s;covery of Ellena's &s;afety in&s;pired, and the horrible &s;u&s;picions that Schedoni's a&s;&s;urances of re|lation&s;hip occa&s;ioned. That his Ellena was the daughter of a murderer, that the father of Ellena &s;hould be brought to an ignominious death, and that he him&s;elf, however unintentionally, &s;hould have a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed to this event, were con&s;iderations almo&s;t too horrible to be &s;u&s;tained! Vivaldi &s;ought refuge from them in various conjectures as to the motive, which might have induced Schedoni to a&s;&s;ert a fla&s;hood in this in&s;tance; but that of revenge alone appeared plau|&s;ible; and even this &s;urmi&s;e was weakened, when he con&s;idered that the confe&s;&s;or had a&s;&s;ured him of Elle|na's &s;afety, an a&s;&s;urance which, as Vivaldi did not de|tect the &s;elfi&s;h policy connected with it, he believed Schedoni would not have given, had his general in|tent towards him been malicious. But it was po&s;|&s;ible, that this very information, on which all his com|fort repo&s;ed might be fal&s;e, and had been given only for the purpo&s;e of inflicting the angui&s;h a di&s;covery of the truth mu&s;t load to! With an anxiety &s;o in|ten&s;e, as almo&s;t to overcome his faculty of judging, he examined every minute probability relative to this
<PB N="225" REF="032735_0515_0FF498ECD91A21D8">
point, and concluded with beleiving that Schedoni, had in this la&s;t in&s;tance, at lea&s;t, &s;poken hone&s;tly.</P>
<P>Whether he had done &s;o in his fir&s;t a&s;&s;ertion was a que&s;tion, which had rai&s;ed in Vivald's mind a tempe&s;t of conjecture and of horror; for, while the &s;ubject of it was too a&s;toni&s;hing to be fully believed, it was, al&s;o, too dreadful, not to be apprehended even as a po&s;&s;ibi|lity.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHILE the&s;e events were pa&s;&s;ing in the pri&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition at Rome, Ellena, in the &s;anctuary of <HI>Our Lady of Pity,</HI> remained ignorant of Schedoni's ar|re&s;t, and of Vivaldi's &s;ituation. She under&s;tood that the Confe&s;&s;or was preparing to acknowledge her for his daughter, and believed that &s;he comprehended al&s;o the motive for his ab&s;ence; but, though he had forbid|den her to expect a vi&s;it from him till his arrangement &s;hould be completed, he had promi&s;ed to write in the mean time, and inform her of all the pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances of Vivaldi; his unexpected &s;ilence had excited, therefore apprehen&s;ions as various, though not &s;o terri|ble, as tho&s;e Vivaldi had &s;uffered for her; nor did the &s;ilence of Vivaldi him&s;elf appear le&s;s extraordinary.</P>
<P>"His confinement mu&s;t be &s;evere indeed," &s;aid the afflicted Ellena, "&s;ince he cannot relieve my anxiety by a &s;ingle line of intelligence. Or, perhaps, harra&s;&s;ed by uncea&s;ing oppo&s;ition, he has &s;ubmitted to the com|mand of his family, and has con&s;ented to forget me. Ah! why did I leave the opportunity for that com|mand to his family; why did I not enforce it my&s;elf!</P>
<P>Yet, while &s;he uttered this &s;elf-reproach, the tears &s;he &s;hed contradicted the pride which had &s;ugge&s;ted it; and a conviction lurking in her heart that Vivaldi could not &s;o re&s;ign her, &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated tho&s;e tears. But other conjectures recalled them; it was po&s;&s;ible that he was ill&mdash;that he was dead!</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="032735_0517_0FF498EE607C0658">
In &s;uch vague and gloomy &s;urmi&s;e, her days pa&s;&s;ed away; employment could no longer withdraw her from her&s;elf, nor mu&s;ic, even for a moment, charm away the &s;en&s;e of &s;orrow; yet &s;he regularly partook of the vari|ous occupations of the nuns; and was &s;o far from per|mitting her&s;elf to indulge in any u&s;ele&s;s expre&s;&s;ion of anxiety, that &s;he had never once di&s;clo&s;ed the &s;acred &s;ub|ject of it; &s;o that, though &s;he could not a&s;&s;ume an air of cheerfulne&s;s, &s;he never appeared otherwi&s;e than tran|quil. Her mo&s;t &s;oothing, yet perhaps mo&s;t melancho|ly hour, was when about &s;un-&s;et &s;he could wit draw unnoticed, to the terrace among the rocks, that over|looked the convent, and formed a part of its domain. There, alone and relieved from all ceremonial re&s;traints of the &s;ociety, her very thoughts &s;eemed more at liberty As, from beneath the light foliage of the accacias, or the more maje&s;tic &s;hade of the plane-trees that waved their branches over the many coloured cliffs of this ter|race, Ellena looked down upon the magnificent &s;cenery of the bay, it brought back to memory, in &s;ad, yet plea|&s;ing detail, the many happy days &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed on tho&s;e blue waters, or on the &s;hores, in the &s;ociety of Vivaldi and her departed relative Bianchi; and every point of the pro&s;pect marked by &s;uch remembrance, which the veiling di&s;tance &s;tole, was re&s;cued by imagination, and pictured by affection in tints more animated than tho&s;e of brighte&s;t nature.</P>
<P>One evening Ellena had lingered on the terrace la|ter than u&s;ual. She had watched the rays retiring from the highe&s;t points of the horizon, and the fading imagery of the lower &s;cene, till, the &s;un having &s;unk into the waves, all colouring was withdrawn, except an empur|pling and repo&s;ing hue, which over&s;pread the waters and the heavens, and blended in &s;oft confu&s;ion every feature of the land&s;cape. The roofs and &s;lender &s;pires of the Santa del Pieta, with a &s;ingle tower of the church ri&s;ing loftily over every other part of the buildings that
<PB N="228" REF="032735_0518_0FF499560B0015F8">
compo&s;ed the convent, were fading fa&s;t from the eye; but the &s;olemn tint that inve&s;ted them accorded &s;o well with their &s;tyle, that Ellena was unwilling to relinqui&s;h this intere&s;ting object. Suddenly &s;he perceived through the dubious light an unu&s;ual number of moving figures in the court of the great cloi&s;ter, and li&s;tening, &s;he fan|cied &s;he could di&s;tingui&s;h the murmuring of many voices. The white drapery of the nuns rendered them con&s;pi|cuous as they moved, but it was impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain who were the individuals engaged in this bu&s;tle. Pre|&s;ently the a&s;&s;emblage di&s;per&s;ed; and Ellena, curious to under&s;tand the occa&s;ion, of what &s;he had ob&s;erved, pre|pared to de&s;cend to the convent.</P>
<P>She had left the terrace, and was about to enter a long avenue of che&s;nuts that extended to a part of the convent, communicating immediately with the great court, when &s;he heard approaching &s;teps, and, on turn|ing into the walk, perceived &s;everal per&s;ons advan|cing in the &s;hady di&s;tance. Among the voices, as they drew nearer, &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed one who&s;e inte|re&s;ting tone engaged all her attention, and began al&s;o to awaken memory. She li&s;tened, wondered, doubted, hoped and feared!&mdash;It &s;poke again! Ellena though &s;he could not be deceived in tho&s;e tender accents, &s;o full of intelligence, &s;o expre&s;&s;ive of &s;en&s;ibility and re|finement. She proceeded with quicker &s;teps, yet fal|tered as &s;he drew near the group, and pau&s;ed to di&s;|cern whether among them was any figure that might accord with the voice and ju&s;tify her hopes.</P>
<P>The voice &s;poke again; it pronounced her name; pronounced it with the tremblings of tenderne&s;s and impatience, and Ellena &s;carcely dared to tru&s;t her &s;en|&s;es, when &s;he beheld Olivia, the nun on San Stefano, in the cloi&s;ters of the Della Pieta!</P>
<P>Ellena co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ld find no words to expre&s;s her joy and &s;urprize on beholding her pre&s;erver in &s;afety, and in the&s;e quiet groves; but Olivia repaid all the affectio|ate
<PB N="229" REF="032735_0519_0FF498F0CC88ADE0">
care&s;&s;es of her young friend, and, while &s;he promi&s;|ed to explain the circum&s;tance that had led to her pre|&s;ent appearance here, &s;he, in her turn, made numerous enquiries relative to Ellena's adventures after &s;he had quitted San Stefano. They were now, however, &s;urrounded by too many auditors to allow of unre&s;er|ed conver&s;ation; Ellena, therefore, led the nun to her apartment, and Olivia then explained her rea&s;ons for having left the convent of San Stefano, which were indeed &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify, even with the mo&s;t rigid devotee, her conduct as to the change. This unfor|tunate reclu&s;e, it appeared, per&s;ecuted by the &s;u&s;picions of the abbe&s;s, who under&s;tood that &s;he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the liberation of Ellena, had petitioned the bi&s;hop of her dioce&s;e for leave to remove to the Santa della Pic|ta. The abbe&s;s had not proof, to proceed formally again&s;t her, as an accomplice in the e&s;cape of a no|vice, for though Jeronimo could have &s;upplied the re|qui&s;ite evidence, he was too deeply implicated in this adventure to do &s;o, without betraying his own con|duct. From his having withheld &s;uch proof, it ap|pears, however, that accident, rather than de&s;ign, had occa&s;ioned his failure on the evening of Ellena's de|parture from the mona&s;tery. But, though the abbe&s;s had not te&s;timony enough for legal puni&s;hment, &s;he was acquainted with circum&s;tances &s;ufficient to ju&s;ti|fy &s;u&s;picions, and had both the inclination and the power to render Olivia very mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>In her choice of the Santa della Pieta, the nun was influenced by many con&s;iderations &s;ome of which were the con&s;equence of conver&s;ations &s;he had held with Ellena re&s;pecting the &s;tate of that &s;ociety. Her de&s;ign &s;he had been unable to di&s;clo&s;e to her freind, le&s;t by a di&s;covery of &s;uch corre&s;pondence, the abbe&s;s of San Stefano &s;hould obtain grounds on which to pro|ceed again&s;t her. Even in her appeal to the bi&s;hop the utmo&s;t caution and &s;ecrecy had been nece&s;&s;ary, till
<PB N="230" REF="032735_0520_0FF4995793EB9048">
the order for her removal, procured not without con|&s;iderable delay and difficulty, arrived, and when it came, the jealous anger of the &s;uperior rendered an imme|diate departure nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Olivia, during many years, had been unhappy in her local circum&s;tances, but it is probable &s;he would have concluded her days within the walls of San Ste|fano, had not the aggravated oppre&s;&s;ion of the abbe&s;s arou&s;ed her courage and activity, and di&s;&s;ipated the de&s;pondency, with which &s;evere misfortune had ob|&s;cured her views.</P>
<P>Ellena was particular in her inquiries whether any per&s;on of the mona&s;tery had &s;uffered for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they had given her; but learned, that not one, except Olivia, had been &s;u&s;pected of befriending her; and then under&s;tood, that the venerable friar, who had dar|ed to unfa&s;ten the gate which re&s;tored her with Vival|di to liberty, had not been involved by his kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>"It is an embarra&s;&s;ing and rather an un&s;ual cir|cum&s;tance," concluded Olivia, "to change one's con|vent; but you perceive the &s;trong rea&s;ons which de|termined me upon a removal. I was, however, per|haps, the more impatient of &s;evere treatment, &s;ince you, my &s;i&s;ter, had de&s;cribed to me the &s;ociety of <HI>Our Lady of Pity,</HI> and &s;ince I believed it po&s;&s;ible that you might form a part of it. When, on my arrival here, I learned that my wi&s;hes had not deceived me on this point, I was impatient to &s;ee you once more, and as &s;oon as the ceremonies attending an introduction to the &s;uperior were over, I reque&s;ted to be conduct|ed to you, and was in &s;earch of you when we met in the avenue. It is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to in&s;i&s;t upon the &s;atisfaction, which this meeting gives me; but, you may not, perhaps, under&s;tand how much the man|ners of our lady abbe&s;s, and of the &s;i&s;terhood in gene|ral, as far as a fir&s;t interview will allow me to judge of them, have re-animated, me. The gloom, which
<PB N="231" REF="032735_0521_0FF498FA487C4D60">
has long hung over my pro&s;pects, &s;eems now to open, and a di&s;tant gleam promi&s;es to light up the evening of my &s;tormy day."</P>
<P>Olivia pau&s;ed and appeared to recollect her&s;elf; this was the fir&s;t time &s;he had made &s;o direct a reference to own her misfortunes: and, while Ellena &s;ilently remarked it, and ob&s;erved the dejection, which was already &s;tealing upon the expre&s;&s;ive countenance of the nun, &s;he wi&s;hed, yet feared to lead her back to|wards the &s;ubject of them.</P>
<P>Endeavouring to di&s;mi&s;s &s;ome painful remem|brance, and a&s;&s;uming a &s;mile of languid gaiety, Oli|via &s;aid, "Now that I have related the hi&s;tory of my removal, and &s;ufficiently indulged my egoti&s;m, will you, let me hear what adventures have befallen you, my young friend, &s;ince the melancholy adieu you gave me in the gardens of San Stefano."</P>
<P>This was a ta&s;k, to which Ellena's &s;pirits, though revived by the pre&s;ence of Olivia, were &s;till unequal, Over the &s;cenes of her pa&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. Time had not yet drawn his &s;hadowing veil; the colours were all too fre&s;h and gari&s;h for the meek dejection of her eye, and the &s;ubject was too intimately connected with that of her pre&s;ent anxiety, to be reviewed without very painful feelings. She therefore reque&s;ted Oli|via to &s;pare her from a detail of particulars, which &s;he could not recollect but with extreme reluctance; and, &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erving the injunction of Schedoni, &s;he merely mentioned her &s;eparation from Vivaldi upon the banks of the Celano, and that a variety of di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing circum&s;tances had intervened before &s;he could re|gain the &s;anctuary of the della Pieta.</P>
<P>Olivia under&s;tood too well the kind of feelings, from which Ellena was de&s;irous of e&s;caping, willingly to &s;ubject her to renewal of them and felt too much generous compa&s;&s;ion for her &s;ufferings not to endea|vour to &s;oothe the &s;en&s;e of them by an exertion of
<PB N="232" REF="032735_0522_0FF499591A1206C8">
tho&s;e delicate and namele&s;s arts, which, while they mock detection, fa&s;cinate, the weary &s;pirits as by a charm of magic!</P>
<P>The friends continued in conver&s;ation, till a chime from a chapel of the convent &s;ummoned them to the la&s;t ve&s;pers; and when the &s;ervice had concluded, they &s;eparated for the night</P>
<P>With the &s;ociety of the Santa della Pieta, Olivia had this found an a&s;ylum &s;uch as till lately &s;he had never dared to hope for; but though &s;he frequently expre&s;&s;ed her &s;en&s;e of this ble&s;&s;ing, it was &s;eldom without tears; and Ellena ob&s;erved, with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e and more di&s;|appointment, within a few days after her arrival, a cloud of melancholy &s;preading again over her mind.</P>
<P>But a nearer intere&s;t &s;oon withdrew Ellena's atten|tion from Olivia to fix it upon Vivaldi; and, when &s;he &s;aw her infirm old &s;ervant, Beatrice, enter a cham|ber of the convent, &s;he anticipated that the knowledge of &s;ome extraordinary, and probably unhappy event, had brought her. She knew too well the circum|&s;pection of Schedoni to believe that Beatrice came commi&s;&s;ioned from him: and as the uncertain &s;itua|tion of Vivaldi was &s;o con&s;tantly the &s;ubject of her anxiety, &s;he immediately concluded that her &s;ervant came to announce &s;ome evil relative to him.&mdash;His in|di&s;po&s;ition, perhaps his actual confinement in the Inqui&s;ition, which lately &s;he had &s;ometimes been in|clined to think might not have been a mere menace to Vivaldi, though it had proved to be no more to her|&s;elf;&mdash;or po&s;&s;ibly &s;he came to tell of his death&mdash;his death in tho&s;e pri&s;ons! This la&s;t was a po&s;&s;ibility that almo&s;t incapacitated her for inquiring what was the errand of Beatrice.</P>
<P>The old &s;ervant, trembling and wan, either from the fatigue of her walk, or from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of di&s;|a&s;trous intelligence, &s;eated her&s;elf without &s;peaking, and &s;ome moments elap&s;ed before &s;he could be pre|vailed
<PB N="233" REF="032735_0523_0FF498FBCED19058">
with to give an an&s;wer the repeated inquiries of Ellena.</P>
<P>"O Signora!" &s;aid &s;he, at length, "you do not know what it is to walk up hill &s;uch a long way, at my age! Well! heaven protect you, I hope you ne|ver will!"</P>
<P>"I perceive you bring ill news," &s;aid Ellena; "I am prepared for it, and you need not fear to tell me all you know."</P>
<P>"Holy San Marco!" exclaimed Beatrice, "if death be ill news, you have gue&s;&s;ed right, Signora, for I do bring news of that, it is certain. How came you, La|dy, to know my errand? They have been before|hand with me, I &s;ee, though I have not walked &s;o fa&s;t up hill this many a day, as I have now to tell you what has happened."</P>
<P>She &s;topped on ob&s;erving the changing countenance of Ellena, who tremulou&s;ly called upon her to ex|plain what had happened&mdash;who was dead; and en|treated her to relate the particulars as &s;peedily as po&s;|&s;ible.</P>
<P>"You &s;aid you was prepared, Signora," &s;aid Bea|trice, "but your looks tell another tale."&mdash;</P>
<P>"What is the event you would di&s;clo&s;e?" &s;aid El|lena, almo&s;t breathle&s;s. "When did it happen?&mdash;be brief."</P>
<P>"I cannot tell exactly when it happened, Signora, but it was an own &s;ervant of the Marche&s;e's that I had it from.</P>
<P>"The Marche&s;e's?" interrupted Ellena in a faul|tering voice.</P>
<P>"Aye, Lady; you will &s;ay that is pretty good au|thority."</P>
<P>"Death! and in the Marche&s;e's family!" exclaim|ed Ellena.</P>
<P>"Yes, Signora, I had it from his own &s;ervant. He was pa&s;&s;ing by the garden-gate ju&s;t as I happened to
<PB N="234" REF="032735_0524_0FF4995A9E6E96A0">
be &s;peaking to the maccaroni-man.&mdash;But you are ill, Lady!&mdash;</P>
<P>"I am very well, if you will but proceed," replied Ellena, faintly, while her eyes were fixed upon Bea|trice, as if they only had power to enforce her mean|ing.</P>
<P>"Well, dame," he &s;ays to me, "I have not &s;een you of along time." "No," &s;ays I, "that is a great grievance truly! for old women, now-a-days, are not much thought of; out of &s;ight, out of mind with them, now a-days!"</P>
<P>"I be&s;eech you to the purpo&s;e," interrupted Ellena. "Who&s;e death did he announce?" She had not cour|age to pronounce Vivaldi's name.</P>
<P>"You &s;hall hear, Signora. I &s;aw he looked in a &s;ort of bu&s;tle, &s;o I a&s;ked him how all did at the Palaz|zo; &s;o he an&s;wers, "Bad enough, Signora Beatrice, have not you heard?" "Heard," &s;ays I; "what &s;hould I have heard?" "Why," &s;ays he, "of what has ju&s;t happened in our family."</P>
<P>"O heavens!" exclaimed Ellena, "he is dead! Vivaldi is dead!"</P>
<P>"You &s;hall hear, Signora," continued Bea|trice."</P>
<P>"Be brief!" &s;aid Ellena, "an&s;wer me &s;imply yes or no,"</P>
<P>"I cannot, till I come to the right place, Signora; if you will but have a little patience, you &s;hall hear all. But if you flu&s;ter me &s;o, you will put me quite out."</P>
<P>"Grant me patience!" &s;aid Ellena, endeavouring to calm her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>"With that, Signora, I a&s;ked him to walk in and re&s;t him&s;elf, and tell me all about it. He an&s;wered, he was in a great hurry, and could not &s;tay a moment, and a great deal of that &s;ort; but I, knowing that whatever happened in that family, Signora, was &s;ome|thing
<PB N="235" REF="032735_0525_0FF498FD54461040">
to you, would not let him go off &s;o ea&s;ily; and &s;o, when I a&s;ked him to refre&s;h him&s;elf with a gla&s;s of lemon-ice, he forgot all his bu&s;ine&s;s in a minute, and we had a long chat."</P>
<P>And Beatrice might now have continued her cir|cumlocution, perhaps, as long as &s;he had plea&s;ed, for Ellena had lo&s;t all power to urge inquiry, and was &s;carcely &s;en&s;ible of what was &s;aid. She neither &s;poke, nor &s;hed a tear; the one image that po&s;&s;&s;eed her fancy, the image of Vivaldi dead, &s;eemed to held all her faculties, as by a &s;pell.</P>
<P>"So, when I a&s;ked him," added Beatrice, "again what had happened, he was ready enough to tell all a|bout it. "It is near a month ago," &s;aid he, "&s;ince &s;he was fir&s;t taken; the Marche&s;a had been"&mdash;</P>
<P>"The Marche&s;a!" repeated Ellena, with whom that one word had di&s;&s;olved the &s;pell of terror&mdash;"the Marche&s;a!"</P>
<P>"Yes, Signora, to be &s;ure. Who el&s;e did I &s;ay it was!"</P>
<P>"Go on, Beatrice; the Marche&s;a?"&mdash;</P>
<P>"What makes you look &s;o glad all of a &s;udden, Sig|nora? I thought ju&s;t now you were very &s;orry about it. What! I warrant you was thinking about my young lord, Vivaldi."</P>
<P>"Proceed," &s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P>"Well added Beatrice, "It was about a month ago that the Marche&s;a was fir&s;t taken," continued the var|let. "She had &s;eemed poorly a long time, but it was from a <HI>conver&s;azione</HI> at the di Voglio palazzo, that &s;he came home &s;o ill. It is &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he had been long in a bad &s;tate of health, but nobody thought her &s;o near her end, till the doctors were called together; and then matters looked very bad indeed. They found out that &s;he had been dying, or as good, for many years, though nobody el&s;e had &s;u&s;pected it, and the Marche&s;a's own phy&s;ician was blamed for not finding it out before. But he added the rougue, "He had a regard for my

lady. He was very ob&s;tinate too, for he kept &s;aying almo&s;t to the la&s;t, there was no danger, when every body el&s;e &s;aw how it was going. The other doctors &s;oon made their words good, and my lady died."</P>
<P>"And her &s;on',&mdash;&s;aid Ellena, "was he with the Marche&s;a when &s;he expired?"</P>
<P>"What, Signor Vivaldi, lady? No, the Signor was not there."</P>
<P>"That is very extraordinary!" ob&s;erved Ellena, with emotion' "Did the &s;ervant mention him?"</P>
<P>Yes, Signora; he &s;aid what a &s;ad thing it was that he &s;hould be out of the way at that time, and nobody know where?"</P>
<P>"Are his family, then, ignorant where he is?" a&s;|ked Ellena with encrea&s;ed emotion.</P>
<P>"To be &s;ure they are, lady, and have been for the&s;e many weeks. They have heard nothing at all of the Signor, or one Paulo Mendrico, his &s;ervant, though the Marche&s;a's people have been riding po&s;t after them from one end of the kingdom to the other all the time!"</P>
<P>Shocked with the conviction of a circum&s;tance, which, till lately &s;he &s;carcely believed was po&s;&s;ible, the impri&s;onment of Vivaldi in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Inqui&s;ition, Ellena lo&s;t for a while all power of further inquiry; but Beatrice proceeded.</P>
<P>"The Lady Marche&s;a &s;eemed to lay &s;omething much to heart, as the man told me, and often inquir|ed for Signor Vincentio."</P>
<P>"The Marche&s;a you are &s;ure then was ignorant where he was?" &s;aid Ellena, with new a&s;toni&s;hment and perplexity as to the per&s;on who, after betraying him into the Inqui&s;ition, could yet have &s;uffered her, though arre&s;ted at the &s;ame time to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>"Yes, Signora, for &s;he wanted &s;adly to &s;ee him. And when &s;he was dying, &s;he &s;ent for her Confe&s;&s;or, one father Schedoni, I think they call him and"&mdash;</P>
<P>"What of him?" &s;aid Ellena incautiou&s;ly.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="032735_0527_0FF498FED90011F8">
"Nothing, Signora, for he could not he found."</P>
<P>"Not to be found!" repeated Ellena.</P>
<P>"No, Signora, not ju&s;t then; he was Confe&s;&s;or, I warrant, to other people be&s;ide the Marche&s;a, and I dare &s;ay they had &s;ins enough to confe&s;s, &s;o he could not get away in a hurry."</P>
<P>Ellena recollected her&s;elf &s;ufficiently to a&s;k no fur|ther of Schedoni; and when &s;he con&s;idered the pro|pable cau&s;e of Vivaldi's arre&s;t, &s;he was again con&s;ol|ed by a belief that he had not fallen into the power of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eal officials, &s;ince the comrades of the men who had arre&s;ted him, had proved them&s;elves otherwi&s;e; and &s;he thought it highly probable, that while undi&s;covered by his family, he had been, and was &s;till engaged in &s;earching for the place of her confinement.</P>
<P>"But I was &s;aying," proceeded Beatrice, "what a bu&s;tle there was when my lady, the Marche&s;a was dying. As this father Schedoni was not to be found, another Confe&s;&s;or was &s;ent for, and &s;hut up with her for a long while indeed! And then my Lord Marche&s;e was called in, and there &s;eemed to be a deal going forward, for my Lord was heard every now and then by the attendants in the anti-chamber, talking loud, and &s;ometimes my Lady Marche&s;a's voice was heard too, though &s;he was &s;o ill! At la&s;t all was &s;ilent, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ter &s;ome time my Lord came out of the room, and he &s;eemed very much flu&s;tered they &s;ay, that he is, very angry and yet very &s;orrowful. But the Confe&s;&s;or re|mained with my Lady for a long while after; and, when he departed, my Lady appeared more unhappy than ever. She lived all that night and part of the next day, and &s;omething &s;eemed to lie very heavy at her heart, for &s;he &s;ometimes wept, but oftener groaned, and would look &s;o that, it was piteous to &s;ee her. She frequently a&s;ked for the Marche&s;e, and when he came, the attendants were &s;ent away, and they held long conferences by them&s;elves. The Confe&s;&s;or, al&s;o was
<PB N="238" REF="032735_0528_0FF499663A4AB6D8">
&s;ent for again, ju&s;t at the la&s;t, and they were all &s;hut up together. After this, my Lady appeared more ea&s;y in her mind, and not long after &s;he died."</P>
<P>Ellena, who had attended clo&s;ely to this little narra|tive, was prevented, for the pre&s;ent from a&s;king the few que&s;tions which it had &s;ugge&s;ted by the en|trance of Olivia, who, on perceiving a &s;tranger, was retiring, but Ellena, not con&s;idering the&s;e inquiries as important, prevailed with the nun to take a chair at the embroidery frame &s;he had lately quitted.</P>
<P>After conver&s;ing for a few moments with Olivia, &s;he returned to a con&s;ideration of her own intere&s;ts. The ab&s;ence of Schedoni &s;till appeared to her as &s;ome|thing more than accidental; and, and though &s;he could not urge any inquiry with Beatrice, concerning the monk of the Spirito Santo, &s;he ventured to a&s;k whether &s;he had lately &s;een the &s;tranger, who had re|&s;tored her to Altieri, for Beatrice knew him only in the character of Ellena's deliver.</P>
<P>"No, Signora," replied Beatrice, rather &s;harply, "I have never &s;een his face &s;ince he attended you to the villa, though for that matter, I did not &s;ee much of it there; and then how he contrived to let him&s;elf out of the hou&s;e that night without my &s;eeing him, I cannot divine, though I have thought of it often enough &s;ince. I am &s;ure he need not to have been a|&s;hamed to have &s;hewn his face to me, for I &s;hould on|ly have ble&s;&s;ed him for bringing you &s;afe home again."</P>
<P>Ellena was &s;omewhat &s;urprized to find that Bea|trice had noticed a circum&s;tance apparently &s;o trivial, and replied, that &s;he had her&s;elf opened the door for her protector.</P>
<P>While Beatrice &s;poke, Olivia rai&s;ing her eyes from the embroidery, had fixed them upon the old &s;ervant, who re&s;pectfully withdrew her's; but, when the nun was again engaged on her work, &s;he re&s;umed her ob|&s;ervation. Ellena fancied &s;he perceived &s;omething
<PB N="239" REF="032735_0529_0FF49908E4CFF728">
extraordinary in this mutual examination, although the curio&s;ity of &s;trangers towards each other might have accounted for it,</P>
<P>Beatrice then received directions from Ellena as to, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me drawings, which &s;he wi&s;hed to have &s;ent to the convent, and when the &s;ervant &s;poke in reply, Olivia again rai&s;ed eyes, and fixed them on her face with inten&s;e curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>"I certainly ought to know that voice," &s;aid the nun, with great emotion, "thought I dare not judge from your features. Is it,&mdash;can it be po&s;&s;ible?&mdash;is it Beatrice Olca, to whom I &s;peak? So many years have pa&s;&s;ed."&mdash;Beatrice, with equal &s;urpri&s;e, an&s;|wered, "It is, Signora; you are right in my name. But, lady, who are you that know me?"</P>
<P>While &s;he earne&s;tly regarded Olivia, there was an expre&s;&s;ion of di&s;may in her look, which increa&s;ed El|lena's perplexity. The nun's complexion varied every in&s;tant, and her words failed when &s;he attempt|ed to &s;peak. Beatrice meanwhile, exclaimed "My eyes deceive me! yet there is a &s;trange likene&s;s. San|ta della Pieta! how it has fluttered me! my heart beats &s;till&mdash;you are &s;o like her, lady, yet you are very different too."</P>
<P>Olivia, who&s;e regards were now entirely fixed up|on Ellena, &s;aid in a voice that was &s;carcely articulate, while her whole frame &s;eemed &s;inking beneath &s;ome irre&s;i&s;tible feeling, "Tell me, Beatrice, I conjure you, quickly &s;ay, who is this?"&mdash;She pointed to Ellena, and the &s;entence died on her lips.</P>
<P>Beatrice, wholly occupied by intere&s;ts of her own, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ave no reply, but exclaimed, "It is, in truth, the Lady Olivia! It is her&s;elf! In the name of all that is &s;acred, how came you here? O! how glad you mu&s;t have been to find one another out!" She looked, &s;till ga&s;ping with a&s;toni&s;hment at Olivia, while Ellena unheard, repeatedly enquired the meaning of her words,
<PB N="240" REF="032735_0530_0FF49967C3B6A348">
and in the next moment found her&s;elf pre&s;&s;ed to the bo&s;om of the nun, who &s;eemed better to have under|&s;tood them, and who weeping, trembling, and almo&s;t fainting, held her there in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Ellena, after &s;ome moments had thus pa&s;&s;ed, re|que&s;ted an explanation of what &s;he witne&s;&s;ed, and Bea|trice, at the &s;ame time, demanded the cau&s;e of all this emotion. "For can it be that you did not know one another?" &s;he added.</P>
<P>"What new di&s;covery is this?" &s;aid Ellena, fear|fully to the nun. "It is but lately that I have found my father! O tell me by what tender name I am to call you?"</P>
<P>"Your father! exclaimed Olivia.</P>
<P>"Your father, lady!" echoed Beatrice.</P>
<P>Ellena, betrayed by &s;trong emotion into this pre|mature mention of Schedoni, was embarra&s;&s;ed and re|mained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"No, my child!" &s;aid Olivia, &s;oftening from a|mazement into tones of ineffable &s;orrow, while &s;he a|gain pre&s;&s;ed Ellena to her heart&mdash;"No! thy father is in the grave!"</P>
<P>Ellena no longer returned her care&s;&s;es; &s;urprize and doubt &s;u&s;pended every tender emotion; &s;he gazed upon Olivia with an inten&s;ene&s;s that partook of wildne&s;s. At length, &s;he &s;aid, &s;lowly&mdash;"It is my mother, then, whom I &s;ee! When will the&s;e di&s;cove|ries end!"</P>
<P>"It is your mother!" replied Olivia, &s;olemnly: a mother's ble&s;&s;ing re&s;ts with you!"</P>
<P>The nun endeavoured to &s;oothe the agitated &s;pirits of Ellena, though &s;he was her&s;elf nearly overwhelmed by the various and acute feelings this di&s;clo&s;ure occa|&s;ioned. For a con&s;iderable time they were unable to &s;peak but in &s;hort &s;entences of affectionate exclama|tion, but joy was evidently a more predominant feel|ing with the parent than with the child. When, how|ever,
<PB N="241" REF="032735_0531_0FF4990A6B8C50C0">
Ellena could weep, &s;he became more tranquil, and, by degrees, was &s;en&s;ible of a degree of happine&s;s, &s;uch as &s;he had, perhaps, never experienced.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Beatrice &s;eemed lo&s;t in amazement mingled with fear. She expre&s;&s;ed no plea&s;ure, not|with&s;tanding the joy &s;he witne&s;&s;ed, but was uniform|ly grave and ob&s;ervant.</P>
<P>Olivia, when &s;he recovered &s;ome degree of com|po&s;ure, inquired for her &s;i&s;ter Bianchi. The &s;ilence and &s;udden dejection of Ellena indicated the truth. On this mention of her late mi&s;tre&s;s, Beatrice recovered the u&s;e of &s;peech.</P>
<P>"Alas! lady," &s;aid the old &s;ervant, "&s;he is now where I believed you were! and I &s;hould as &s;oon have expected to &s;ee my dear mi&s;tre&s;s here as your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Olivia, though affected by this intelligence, did not feel it with the acutene&s;s &s;he would have done proba|bly at any other moment. After &s;he had indulged her tears, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he added, that from the unu&s;ual &s;ilence of Bi|anchi, &s;he had &s;u&s;pected the truth, and particularly &s;ince not any an&s;wer had been returned to the letter &s;he had &s;ent to Altieri upon her arrival at the Santa del|la Pieta.</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid Beatrice, "I wonder much my lady abbe&s;s failed to tell you the &s;ad news, for &s;he knew it too well!&mdash;My dear mi&s;tre&s;s is buried in the church here! as for the letter, I have brought it with me for Signora Ellena to open."</P>
<P>"The lady abbe&s;s is not informed of our relation|&s;hip," replied Olivia, "and I have particular rea&s;ons for wi&s;hing that at pre&s;ent &s;he &s;hould remain ignorant of it. Even you my Ellena, mu&s;t appear only as my friend, till &s;ome enquiries have been made which are e&s;&s;ential to my peace."</P>
<P>Olivia required an explanation of Ellena's late ex|traordinary a&s;&s;ertion re&s;pecting her father, but this was a reque&s;t made with emotions very different from
<PB N="242" REF="032735_0532_0FF4996948275378">
tho&s;e which hope or joy in&s;pire. Ellena believing that the &s;ame circum&s;tances which had deceived her&s;elf during &s;o many years, as to his death, had al&s;o mi&s;led Olivia, was not &s;urpri&s;ed at the incredulity her mother had &s;hewn, but &s;he was con&s;iderably embarra&s;&s;ed how to an&s;wer her enquiries. It was now too late to ob|&s;erve the promi&s;e of &s;ecrecy extorted from her by Sche|doni: the fir&s;t moments of &s;urpri&s;e had betrayed her; yet while &s;he trembled further to tran&s;gre&s;s his injunc|tion, &s;he perceived that a full explanation was now unavoidable. And, &s;ince Ellena con&s;idered, that as Schedoni could not have fore&s;een her pre&s;ent peculiar &s;ituation, his command had no reference to her mother, her &s;cruples on this head di&s;appeared. When, there|fore, Beatrice had withdrawn, Ellena repeated her a&s;|&s;ertion, that he father &s;till lived; which, though it encrea&s;ed the amazement of Olivia, did not vanqui&s;h her incredulity. Olivia's tears flowed fa&s;t, while in con|tradiction to this a&s;&s;urance, &s;he mentioned the year in which the Count di Bruno died, with &s;ome circum|&s;tances relative to his death; which however, as El|lena under&s;tood that her mother had not witne&s;&s;ed it, &s;he &s;till believed it had not happened. To confirm her late a&s;&s;ertion, Ellena then related a few particulars of her &s;econd interview with Schedoni, and &s;ome confir|mation that he lived, offered to produce the portrait, which he had claimed as his own. Olivia, in great agitation, reque&s;ted to &s;ee the minature, and Ellena left the apartment in &s;earch of it.</P>
<P>Every moment of her ab&s;ence was to Olivia's ex|pectation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> hour; &s;he p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ced the room li&s;tened <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> endeavoured to tranquilize her &s;pirit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> did not return.

<PB N="243" REF="032735_0533_0FF4990BF6D5A0D0">
gazed upon it for an in&s;tant, her complexion faded and &s;he fainted.</P>
<P>Ellena had now no doubt re&s;pecting the truth of Schedoni's declaration, and blamed her&s;elf for not hav|ing more gradually prepared her mother for the know|ledge of a circum&s;tance, which &s;he believed had over|whelmed her with joy. The u&s;ual applications, however, &s;oon re&s;tored Olivia, who, when &s;he was again alone with her daughter, de&s;ired to behold once more the portrait. Ellena attributing the &s;trong emo|tion with which &s;he &s;till regarded it, to &s;urpri&s;e, and fear le&s;t &s;he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> admitting a fallacious hope, endea|voured to comfort her by renewed a&s;&s;urances, that not only the Count di Bruno yet exi&s;ted, but that he lived at this very time in Naples, and further, that he would probably be in her pre&s;ence within the hour. "When I quitted the room for the minature," added Ellena, "I di&s;patched a per&s;on with a note, reque&s;ting to &s;ee my father immediately, being impatient to re|alize the joy, which &s;uch a meeting between my long lo&s;t parents mu&s;t occa&s;ion."</P>
<P>In this in&s;tance, Ellena had certainly &s;uffered her generous &s;ympathy to overcome her di&s;cretion, for, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hough the contents of the note to Schedoni could not po&s;itively have betrayed him, had he even been in Naples at this time, her &s;ending it to the Spirito San|to, in&s;tead of the place which he had appointed for his letters, might have led to a premature inquiry re&s;pect|ing her&s;elf.</P>
<P>While Ellena had acquainted Olivia that Schedo|ni would probably be with them &s;oon, &s;he watched eagerly for the joyful &s;urpri&s;e &s;he expected would appear on her countenance; how &s;evere th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n was her di&s;appointment when only terror and di&s;may were expre&s;&s;ed there! and, when, in the next moment, her mother uttered exclamations of di&s;tre&s;s and even of de&s;pair!</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="032735_0534_0FF4997590F0B738">
"If he &s;ees me," &s;aid Olivia, "I am irrecoverably lo&s;t! O! unhappy Ellena! your precipitancy has de&s;troyed me. The original of this portrait is not the Count di Bruno, my dear lord, nor, your parent, but his brother, the cruel hu&s;band."&mdash;</P>
<P>Olivia, left the &s;entence unfini&s;hed, as if &s;he was betraying more than was at pre&s;ent di&s;creet; but Elle|na, whom a&s;toni&s;hment had kept &s;ilent, now entreated that &s;he would explain her words, and the cau&s;e of her di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<P>Olivia was however, &s;oothed when &s;he under&s;tood that Ellena had not named her in the note, but had merely de&s;ired to &s;ee the Confe&s;&s;or upon a very par|ticular occa&s;ion.</P>

but is was not till &s;everal days after this di&s;|covery, that &s;he could &s;ufficiently command her &s;pirits to relate the whole of her narrative. The fir&s;t part of it agreed perfectly with the account delivered in the confe&s;&s;ion to the penitentiary An&s;aldo; that which follows was known only to her&s;elf, her &s;i&s;ter Bianchi, a phy&s;ician, and one faithful &s;ervant, who had been con&s;iderably entru&s;ted with the conduct of the plan.</P>
<P>It may be recollected that Schedoni left his hou&s;e immediately after the act, which was de&s;igned to be fa|tal to the Counte&s;s his wife, and that &s;he was carried &s;en&s;ele&s;s to her chamber. The wound as appears was not mortal. But the atrocity of the intent determin|ed her to &s;eize the opportunity thus offered by the ab|&s;ence of Schedoni, and her own peculiar circum|&s;tances to relea&s;e her&s;elf from his tyranny without ha|ving recour&s;e to a court of ju&s;tice, which would have covered with infamy the brother of her fir&s;t hu&s;band. She withdrew, therefore, from his hou&s;e for ever, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the three per&s;ons before men|tioned, retired to a remote part of Italy, and &s;ought refuge in the convent of San Stefano, while at home the report of her death was confirmed by a public funeral. Bianchi remained for &s;ome time after the de|parture of Olivia, in her own re&s;idence near the vil|la di Bruno, having taken under her immediate care the daughter of the Counte&s;s and of the fir&s;t Count di Bruno, as well as an infant daughter of the &s;econd.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time had clap&s;ed, Bianchi withdrew with her young charge, but not to the neighbourhood of San Stefano. The indulgence of a mother's tender|ne&s;s was denied to Olivia, for Bianchi could not re|&s;ide near the convent without &s;ubjecting her to the ha|zard of di&s;covery, &s;ince Schedoni, though he now believed the report of her death, might be led to doubt it by the conduct of Bianchi, who&s;e &s;teps would pro|bably be ob&s;erved by him. She cho&s;e a refider<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">,
<PB N="246" REF="032735_0536_0FF49977198EA5F8">
therefore, at a di&s;tance from Olivia, though not yet at Altieri. At this period, Ellena was not two years old; the daughter of Schedoni was &s;carcely as many months, as &s;he died before the year concluded. It was this his child for whom the Confe&s;&s;or, who had too well concealed him&s;elf to permit Bianchi to acquaint him with her death, had mi&s;taken Ellena, and to which mi&s;take his own portrait, affirmed by Ellena to be that of her father, had contributed. This minature &s;he had &s;ound in the cabinet of Bianchi after her aunt's decea&s;e, and, ob&s;erving it in&s;cribed with the title of Count di Bruno, &s;he had worn it with a filial fondne&s;s ever &s;ince that period.</P>
<P>Bianchi, when &s;he had acquainted Ellena with the &s;ecret of her birth, was withheld both by prudence and humanity, from intru&s;ting her with a knowledge that her mother lived; but this, no doubt, was the circum|&s;tance &s;he appeared &s;o anxious to di&s;clo&s;e on her death|bed, when the &s;uddenne&s;s of her di&s;order had deprived her of the power. The abruptne&s;s of that event had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> contributed to keep the mother and daughter un|known to each other, even when they afterwards acci|dentally met, to which concealment the name of Ro&s;al|ba, given to Ellena from her infancy by Bianchi, for the purpo&s;e of protecting her from di&s;covery by her uncle, had a&s;&s;i&s;ted. Beatrice, who was not the dome&s;|tic intru&s;ted with the e&s;cape of Olivia, had believed the report of her death, and thus, though &s;he knew Ellena to be the daughter of the Counte&s;s di Bruno, &s;he could never have been a means of di&s;covering them to each other, had it not happened that Olivia re|cognized this ancient &s;ervant of Bianchi, while Ellena was pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>When Bianchi came to re&s;ide in the neighbourhood of Naples, &s;he was un&s;u&s;picious that Schedoni, who has never been heard of &s;ince the night of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation, inhabited there; and &s;he &s;o &s;eldom left her
<PB N="247" REF="032735_0537_0FF499199B088458">
hou&s;e, that it is not &s;urpri&s;ing &s;he &s;hould never hap|pen to meet him, at lea&s;t con&s;ciou&s;ly; for her veil, and the monk's cowl, might ea&s;ily have concealed them from each other if they had met.</P>
<P>It appears to have been the intention of Bianchi to di&s;clo&s;e to Vivaldi the family of Ellena, before their nuptials, were &s;olemnized; &s;ince, on the evening of their la&s;t conver&s;ation, &s;he had declared, when her &s;pi|rits were exhau&s;ted by the exertion &s;he had made, that much remained for her to &s;ay, which weakne&s;s obliged her to defer till another opportunity. Her unexpected death prevented any future meeting. That &s;he had not &s;ooner intended to make a communication, which might have removed, in a con&s;iderable degree, the objection of the Vivaldi to a connection with El|lena, appears extraordinary till other circum&s;tances of her family, than that of its nobility, are con&s;idered. Her pre&s;ent indigence, and yet more, the guilt attach|ed to an individual of the di Bruno, it was rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e would operate as a full antidote of the al|lurement of rank, however jealous of birth the Vival|di had proved them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Ferando di Bruno had contrived, even in the &s;hort interval between the death of his brother and the &s;up|po&s;ed decea&s;e of his wife, again to embarra&s;s his affairs, and &s;oon after his flight, the income arri&s;ing from what remained of his landed property had been &s;eized upon by his creditors, whether lawfully or not, he was then in a &s;ituation which did not permit him to con|te&s;t and Ellena was thus left wholly dependant upon her aunt. The &s;mall fortune of Bianchi had been di|mini&s;hed by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;he afforded Olivia, for who&s;e admittance into the convent of San Stefano it had been nece&s;&s;ary to advance a con&s;iderable &s;um; and her original income was afterwards reduced by the purcha&s;e of the villa Altieri. This expenditure, how|ever, was not an imprudent one, &s;ince &s;he preferred
<PB N="248" REF="032735_0538_0FF499789E5E2B80">
the comforts and independence of a plea&s;ant home; with indu&s;try, to the indulgence of an indolence which mu&s;t have confined her to an inferior re&s;idence; and was acquainted with the means of making this indu&s;try profitable without being di&s;honourable. She excelled in many elegant and ingenious arts, and the produc|tions of her pencil and needle were privately di&s;po&s;ed of to the nuns of the Santa della Pieta. When Elle|na was of an age to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, &s;he re&s;igned much of the imployment and profit to her niece, who&s;e genius hav|ing unfolded it&s;elf, the beauty of her de&s;igns and the elegance of her execution, both in drawing and em|broidery, were &s;o highly valued by the purcha&s;ers at the grace of the convent, that Bianchi committed to Ellena altogether the exerci&s;e of her art</P>
<P>Olivia meanwhile had dedicated her life to devo|tion in the mona&s;tery of San Stefano, a choice which was willingly made while her mind was yet &s;oftened by grief for the death of her fir&s;t lord, and wearied by the cruelty &s;he had afterwards experienced. The fir&s;t years of her retirement were pa&s;&s;ed in tranquility, ex|cept when the remembrance of her child, whom &s;he did not dare to &s;ee at the convent, awakened a paren|tal pang. With Bianchi, &s;he, however, corre&s;pond|ed as regularly as opportunity would allow, and had at lea&s;t the con&s;olation of knowing, that the object mo&s;t dear to her lived, till, within a &s;hort period of Ellena's arrival at the very a&s;ylum cho&s;en by her mo|ther, her apprehen&s;ions were in &s;ome degree excited by the unu&s;ual &s;ilence of Bianchi.</P>
<P>When Oliva had fir&s;t &s;een Ellena in the chapel of San Stefano, &s;he was &s;truck with a &s;light re&s;emblance &s;he bore to the late Count di Bruno, and had fre|quently afterwards examined her features with a mo&s;t painful curio&s;ity; but, circum&s;tanced as &s;he was, Oli|via could not rea&s;onably &s;u&s;pect the &s;tranger to be her daughter. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, however, a &s;en&s;e of this po&s;&s;ibility
<PB N="249" REF="032735_0539_0FF4991B22AA92A0">
&s;o far overcame her judgment, as to prompt an inqui|ry for the &s;irname of Ellena; but the mention of Ro|&s;alba had checked all further conjecture. What would have been the feelings of the nun, had &s;he been told when her generous compa&s;&s;ion was a&s;&s;i&s;ting a &s;tran|ger to e&s;cape from oppre&s;&s;ion, that &s;he was pre&s;erving her own child! It may be worthy of ob&s;ervation, that the virtues of Olivia, exerted in a general cau&s;e, had thus led her uncon&s;ciou&s;ly to the happine&s;s of &s;aving her daughter; while the vices of Schedoni had as uncon&s;ciou&s;ly urged him nearly to de&s;troy his niece, and had always been preventing by the means they prompted him to employ, the &s;ucce&s;s of his con&s;tant aim.</P>

<P>THE Marche&s;a di Vivaldi, of who&s;e death Bea|trice had given an imperfect account, &s;truck with re|mor&s;e of the crime &s;he had meditated again&s;t Ellena, and with terror of the puni&s;hment due to it, had &s;ent, when on her death bed, for a Confe&s;&s;or, to whom &s;he unburthened her con&s;cience and from whom &s;he hoped to receive, in return, an alleviation of her de&s;|pair. This confe&s;&s;or was a man of good &s;en&s;e and humanity; and, when he fully under&s;tood the &s;tory of Vivaldi and Ellena di Ro&s;alba, he declared, that her only hope of forgivene&s;s both for the crime &s;he had meditated, and the unde&s;erved &s;ufferings &s;he had occa|&s;ioned, re&s;ted upon her willingne&s;s to make tho&s;e now happy, whom &s;he had formerly rendered mi&s;erable. Her con&s;cience had already given her the &s;ame le&s;&s;on; and, now that &s;he was &s;inking to that grave which levels all di&s;tinctions, and had her ju&s;t fear of retribu|tion no longer oppo&s;ed by her pride, &s;he became as anxious to promote the marriage of Vivaldi with Ellena, as &s;he had ever been to prevent it. She &s;ent, therefore, for the Marche&s;e; and, having made an avowal of the arts &s;he had practi&s;ed again&s;t the peace and reputation of Ellena, without, however, confe&s;&s;ing the full extent of her intended crimes, &s;he made it her la&s;t reque&s;t, that he would con&s;ent to the happine&s;s of his &s;on.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e, however, &s;hocked as he was at this di&s;covery of the duplicity and cruelty of his wife, had neither her terror of the future, or remor&s;e for the
<PB N="251" REF="032735_0541_0FF499D5F47CE3C0">
pa&s;t, to overcome his objection to the rank of Ellena; and he re&s;i&s;ted all her importunity, till angui&s;h of her la&s;t hours overcame every con&s;ideration but that of affording her relief; he then gave a &s;olemn promi&s;e, in the pre&s;ence of the Confe&s;&s;or, that he would no longer oppo&s;e the marriage of Vivaldi and Ellena, &s;hould the former per&s;i&s;t in his attachment to her. This promi&s;e was &s;ufficient for the Marche&s;a, and &s;he died with &s;ome degree of re&s;ignation. It did not, however, appear probable, the Marche&s;e would &s;oon be called upon to fulfil the engagements, into which he had &s;o unwillingly entered, every inquiry after Vival|di having been hitherto ineffectual.</P>
<P>During the progre&s;s of this fruitle&s;s &s;earch for his &s;on, and while the Marche&s;e was almo&s;t lamenting him as dead, the inhabitants of the Vivaldi place were, one night, arou&s;ed from &s;leep by a violent knocking at the great gate of the court. The noi&s;e was &s;o loud and ince&s;&s;ant, that, before the porter could obey the &s;ummons, the Marche&s;a, who&s;e apartment looked up|on the court, was alarmed, and &s;ent an attendant from his anti-room, to inquire the occa&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently a voice was heard from the fir&s;t anti|chamber, exclaiming, "I mu&s;t &s;ee my Lord Marche&s;e directly; he will not be angry to be waked, when he knows all about it," and, before the Marche&s;e could order that no per&s;on, on whatever, pretence &s;hould be admitted, Paulo, haggard, ragged, and covered with dirt, was in the chamber. His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and affrighted coun|tenance, his di&s;ordered dre&s;s, and his very attitude, as on entering he half turned to look back upon the anti|rooms, like one, who ju&s;t e&s;caped from bondage, li&s;tens to the fancied &s;ounds of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, were altogether &s;o &s;triking and and terrific, that the Marche&s;e, anticipa|ting &s;ome dreadful news of Vivaldi, had &s;carcely pow|er to inquire for him. Paulo, however, rendered que&s;tions unnece&s;&s;ary; for, without any circumloca|tion
<PB N="252" REF="032735_0542_0FF49986C27B6040">
or preface, he immediately informed the Mar|che&s;e, that the Signor, his dear ma&s;ter was in the pri|&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition, at Rome, if, indeed, they had not put an end to him before that time."</P>
<P>"Yes, my Lord," &s;aid Paulo, "I am ju&s;t got out my&s;elf, for they would not let me be with the Signor &s;o it was of no u&s;e to &s;tay there any longer. Yet it was a hard matter with me to go away, and leave my dear ma&s;ter within tho&s;e di&s;mal walls; and nothing &s;hould have per&s;uaded me to do &s;o, but that I hoped, when your Lord&s;hip knew where the Signor was, yet might be able to get him out. But there is not minute to be lo&s;t, my Lord, for when once a gentle|man has got within the claws of tho&s;e inqui&s;itors, there as no knowing how &s;oon they may take it in their heads to tear him in pieces. Shall I order hor&s;es for Rome, my Lord? I am ready to &s;et off again directly.</P>
<P>The &s;uddenne&s;s of &s;uch intelligence, concerning an only &s;on, might have agitated &s;tronger nerves that tho&s;e of the Marche&s;e, and &s;o much was he &s;hocked be it, that he could not immediately determine how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> proceed or give any an&s;wer to Paulo's repeated que&s;|tions. When, however, he became &s;ufficiently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> collected to make further inquiry into the &s;ituation Vivaldi he perceived the nece&s;&s;ary of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> journey; but, fir&s;t, it would be prudent to con&s;ult with &s;ome friends, who&s;e connections at Rome might be means of greatly facilitating the important purpo&s;e which led him thither, and this could not be done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the following morning. Yet he gave orders, that pre|paration &s;hould be made for his &s;etting out at a mo|ment's notice; and, having li&s;tened to as full an ac|count as Paulo could give of the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances of Vivaldi, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him to repo&s;e for the remainder of the night.</P>
<P>Paulo, however, though much in want of re&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in too great an agitation of Spirits either to &s;eek or
<PB N="253" REF="032735_0543_0FF499D781159E50">
find it; and the fear he had indicated, on entering the Marche&s;e's apartment, proceeded from the hurry of his mind, rather than from any po&s;itive apprehen&s;ion of new evil. For his liberty he was indebted to the young centinel, who had, on a former occa&s;ion, been removed from the door of his pri&s;on, but who, by means of the guard, to whom Vivaldi had given mo|ney, as he returned one night from the tribunal, had &s;ince been able to communicate with him. This man, of a nature too humane for his &s;ituation, was become wretched in it, and he determined to e&s;cape from his office before the expiration of the time, for which he had been engaged. He thought, that to be a guard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ver pri&s;oners was nearly as mi&s;erable as being a pri|&s;oner him&s;elf. "I &s;ee no difference between them," <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he, "except that the pri&s;oner watches on one &s;ide of the door, and the centinel on the other."</P>
<P>With the re&s;olution to relea&s;e him&s;elf, he conferred with Paulo, who&s;e good nature and feeling heart, a|mong &s;o many people of a contrary character, had won <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">is confidence and affection, and he laid his plan of e&s;cape &s;o well, that it was on the point of &s;ucceeding, when Paulo's ob&s;tinacy, in attempting an impo&s;&s;ibility and nearly counteracted the whole. It went to his heart, he &s;aid, to leave his ma&s;ter in pri&s;on, while he him&s;elf was to march off in &s;afety, and he would run <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ri&s;k of his neck, rather than have &s;uch a deed upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> head. He propo&s;ed, therefore, as Vivaldi's guards were of too ferocious a nature to be tampered with, to &s;cale, a wall of the court into which a grate of Vi|valdi's dungeon looked. But had this lofty wall been practicable, the grate was not; and the attempt had nearly co&s;t Paulo not only his liberty, but his life.</P>
<P>When, at length, he had made his way through the perilous avenues of the pri&s;on, and was fairly beyond the walls, he could hardly be prevailed upon by his companion to leave them. For near an hour, he
<PB N="254" REF="032735_0544_0FF499884B848C20">
wandered under their &s;hade, weeping and exclaiming, and calling upon his dear ma&s;ter, at the evident ha|zard of being retaken; and probably would have re|mained there much longer, had not the dawn of morn|ing rendered his companion de&s;perate. Ju&s;t, however, as the man was forcing him away, Paulo fancied he di&s;tingui&s;hed, by the &s;trengthening light, the roof of that particular building, in who&s;e dungeon his ma&s;ter was confined, and the appearance of Vivaldi him&s;elf, could &s;carcely have occa&s;ioned a more &s;udden bur&s;t of joy; &s;ucceeded, by one of grief, "It is the roof, it is the very roof!" exclaimed Paulo, vaulting from the ground, and clapping his hands: "it is the roof, the roof! O, my ma&s;ter, my ma&s;ter! the roof, the roof!" He continued, alternately, to exclaim, "My ma&s;ter! the roof! my ma&s;ter! the roof! till his companion began to fear he was frantic, while tears &s;treamed down his cheeks, and every look and ge&s;ture expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t extravagant and whim&s;ical union of joy and &s;or|row. At length the ab&s;olute terror of di&s;covery com|pelled his companion to force him from the &s;pot; when, having lo&s;t &s;ight of the building which inclo&s;ed Vivaldi, he &s;et off for Naples with a &s;peed that defied all interruption, and arrived there in the condition, which has been mentioned, having taken no &s;leep, and &s;carcely any &s;u&s;tenance, &s;ince he left the inqui&s;ition. Yet, though in this exhau&s;ted &s;tate, the &s;pirit of his affection remained unbroken and when, on the follow|ing morning, the Marche&s;e quitted Naples neither his wearine&s;s, nor the iminent danger, to which this jour|ney mu&s;t expo&s;e him, could prevent his attending him to Rome.</P>
<P>The rank of the Marche&s;e, and the influence he was known to po&s;&s;e&s;s at the court of Naples, were circum|&s;tances that promi&s;ed to have weight with the Holy Office, and to procure Vivaldi a &s;peedy relea&s;e; but yet more than the&s;e, were the high connections which the
<PB N="255" REF="032735_0545_0FF499D906B4BC60">
Count di Maro, the friend of the Marche&s;e, had in the church of Rome.</P>
<P>The applications, however, which were made to the Inqui&s;itors, were not &s;o &s;oon replied to as the wi&s;hes of the Marche&s;e had expected, and he had been above a fortnight in that city, before he was even per|mitted to vi&s;it his &s;on. In this interview, affection predominated on both &s;ides over all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">emembrance of the pa&s;t. The condition of Vivaldi, his faded appear|ance to which the wounds he had received at Celano, and from which he was &s;carcely recovered, had contri|buted; and his &s;ituation in a melancholy and terrible pri&s;on, were circum&s;tances that awakened all the ten|derne&s;s of the father; his errors were forgiven, and the Marche&s;e felt di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ent to all that might re|&s;tore him to happine&s;s, could he but be re&s;tored to liberty.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, when informed of his mother's death, &s;hed bitter tears of &s;orrow and remor&s;e, for having occa&s;ion|ed her &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s. The unrea&s;onablene&s;s of her claims was forgotten, and her faults were extenua|ted; happily, indeed, for his peace, the extent of her criminal de&s;igns he had never under&s;tood; and when he learned that her dying reque&s;t had been intended to promote his happine&s;s, the cruel con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having interrupted her's, occa&s;ioned him &s;evere an|gui&s;h, and he was obliged to recollect her former con|duct towards Ellena at San Stefano, before he could become reconciled to him&s;elf.</P>

<P>NEAR three weeks had elap&s;ed &s;ince the Mar|che&s;e's arrival at Rome, and not any deci&s;ive an&s;wer was returned, by the Inqui&s;ition, to his application when he and Vivaldi received, at the &s;ame time, a &s;um|mons to attend father Schedoni in his dungeon. To meet the man who had occa&s;ioned &s;o much &s;uffering to his family, was extremely painful to the Marche&s;e, but he was not allowed to refu&s;e the interview; and at the hour appointed he called at the chamber of Vivaldi; and, followed by two officials, they pa&s;&s;ed on together to that of Schedoni.</P>
<P>While they waited at the door of the pri&s;on-room, till the numerous bars and locks were unfa&s;tened, the agitation, which Vivaldi had &s;uffered, on receiving the &s;ummons, returned with redoubled force, now that he was about to behold, once more, that wretched man, who had announced him&s;elf to be the parent of Ellena di Ro&s;alba. The Marche&s;e &s;uffered emotions of a dif|ferent nature, and with his reluctance to &s;ee Schedoni, was mingled a degree of curio&s;ity, as to the event, which had occa&s;ioned this &s;ummons.</P>
<P>The door being thrown open, the officials entered fir&s;t, and the Marche&s;e and Vivaldi, on following, di&s;|covered the confe&s;&s;or lying on a mattre&s;s. He did not ri&s;e to receive them, but, as he li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ted his head, and bow|ed it in obei&s;ance, his countenance, upon which the little light admitted through the triple grate of his dun|geon gleamed, &s;eemed more than u&s;ually gha&s;tly; his eyes were hollow, and his &s;hrunk features appeared as
<PB N="257" REF="032735_0547_0FF499DA8DE54810">
if death had already touched them.&mdash;Vivaldi, on per|ceiving him, groaned, and averted his face; but, &s;oon recovering a command of him&s;elf, he approached the mattre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing every expre&s;&s;ion of re|&s;entment towards an enemy, who was reduced to this deplorable condition, inquired what he had to commu|nicate.</P>
<P>"Where is father Nicola?" &s;aid Schedoni, to an official, without attending to the que&s;tion: "I do not, &s;ee him here. Is he gone &s;o &s;oon, and without having heard the purport of my &s;ummons? Let him be called."</P>
<P>The official &s;poke to a centinel, who immediately left the chamber.</P>
<P>"Who are the&s;e that &s;urround me?" &s;aid Schedo|ni. "Who is he that &s;tands at the foot of the bed?" While he &s;poke, he bent his eyes on Vivaldi, who re&s;ted in deep dejection there, and was lo&s;t in thought, till arou&s;ed by Schedoni's voice, he replied,</P>
<P>"It is I, Vincentio di Vivaldi; I obey your requi&s;i|tion, and inquire the purpo&s;e of it?"</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e repeated the demand. Schedoni ap|peared to meditate; &s;ometimes he fixed his eyes upon Vivaldi, for an in&s;tant, and when he withdrew them, he &s;eemed to &s;ink into deeper thoughtfulne&s;s. As he rai&s;ed them once again, they a&s;&s;umed a &s;ingular ex|pre&s;&s;ion of wildne&s;s, and then &s;ettling, as if on vacancy, a &s;udden glare &s;hot from them, while he &s;aid&mdash;"Who is he that glides there in the du&s;k?"</P>
<P>His eyes were directed beyond Vivaldi, who, on turning, perceived the monk, father Nicola, pa&s;&s;ing behind him.</P>
<P>"I am here," &s;aid Nicola: "what do you require of me?"</P>
<P>"That you will bear te&s;timony to the truth of what I &s;hall declare," replied Schedoni.</P>
<P>Nicola and an Inqui&s;itor who had accompanied
<PB N="258" REF="032735_0548_0FF4998B55D52068">
him, immediately arranged them&s;elves on one &s;ide of the bed, while the Marche&s;e &s;tationed him&s;elf on the other. Vivaldi remained at its foot.</P>
<P>Schedoni, after a pau&s;e began: "That which I have to make known relates to the cabal formerly carried on by him, the father Nicola, and my&s;elf, again&s;t the peace of an innocent young woman, whom, at my in|&s;tigation, he has ba&s;ely traduced."</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, Nicola attempted to interrupt the Confe&s;&s;or, but Vivaldi re&s;trained him.</P>
<P>"Ellena di Ro&s;alba is known to you?" continue Schedoni, addre&s;&s;ing the Marche&s;e.</P>
<P>Vivaldi's countenance changed at this abrupt men|tion of Ellena, but he remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"I have heard of her," replied the Marche&s;e, coldly.</P>
<P>"And you have heard fal&s;ely of her rejoined Sche|doni, "Lift your eyes, my lord Marche&s;e, and &s;ay, do you not recollect that face?" pointing to Nicola.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e regarded the monk attentively. "It is a face not ea&s;ily to be forgotten," he replied; "I re|member to have &s;een it more than once."</P>
<P>"Where have you &s;een him, my Lord?"</P>
<P>"In my own palace, at Naples; and you your&s;elf introduced him to me there."</P>
<P>"I did," replied Schedoni.</P>
<P>"Why, then, do you now accu&s;e him of fal&s;ehood," ob&s;erved the Marche&s;e, "&s;ince you acknowledge your|&s;elf to have been the in&s;tigator of his conduct?"</P>
<P>"O heavens!" &s;aid Vivaldi: "this monk, then, this father Nicola, is, as I &s;u&s;pected, the &s;landerer of Ellena di Ro&s;alba!"</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t true," rejoined Schedoni; "and it is for the purpo&s;e of vindicating&mdash;"</P>
<P>"And you acknowledge your&s;elf to be the author of tho&s;e infamous &s;landers!" pa&s;&s;ionately interrupted Vivaldi:&mdash;"you, who but lately declared your&s;elf to be her father!"</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="032735_0549_0FF499E49309A458">
In the in&s;tant, that Vivaldi had uttered this, he be|came &s;en&s;ible of his indi&s;cretion, for till now he had avoided informing the Marche&s;e that Ellena had been declared the daughter of Schedoni. This abrupt di&s;|clo&s;ure, and at &s;uch a moment, he immediately perceiv|ed might be fatal to his hopes, and that the Marche&s;e would not con&s;ider the promi&s;e he had given to his dy|ing wife, however, &s;olemn, as binding, under circum|&s;tances &s;o peculiar and unfore&s;een as the pre&s;ent. The a&s;toni&s;hment of the Marche&s;e, upon this di&s;covery, can|not ea&s;ily be imagined; he looked at his &s;on for an ex|planation of what he had heard, and then, with in|crea&s;ed dete&s;tation, at the Confe&s;&s;or; but Vivaldi was not in a &s;tate of mind to give any explanation at this moment, and he reque&s;ted his father to &s;u&s;pend even his conjectures till he could conver&s;e with him alone.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e de&s;i&s;ted, for the pre&s;ent, from fur|ther inquiry, but it was obvious that his opinion and his re&s;olution, re&s;pecting the marriage of Vivaldi, was already formed.</P>
<P>"You, then, are the author of tho&s;e &s;landers!" re|peated Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Hear me!" cried Schedoni, in a voice which the &s;trength of his &s;pirit, contending with the feeblene&s;s of his condition, rendered hollow and terrible&mdash;"Hear me!"</P>
<P>He &s;topped, unable to recover immediately from the effect of the exertion he had made.&mdash;At length, he re&s;umed:</P>
<P>"I have declared, and I continue to declare, that Ellena di Ro&s;alba, as &s;he has been named for the pur|po&s;e, I conjecture, of concealing her from an unwor|thy father, as my daughter!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi groaned in the exce&s;s of his de&s;pair, but made no further attempt to interrupt Schedoni, The Marche&s;e was not equally pa&s;&s;ive.&mdash;"And was it to li&s;ten to a vindication of your daughter," &s;aid he,
<PB N="260" REF="032735_0550_0FF499965FC76040">
"that I have been &s;ummoned hither? But let this Sig|nora Ro&s;alba, be who &s;he may, of what inport|ance can it be to me whether &s;he is innocent or other|wi&s;e!"</P>
<P>Vivaldi, with the utmo&s;t difficulty, forbore to ex|pre&s;s the feelings, which this &s;entence excited. It appeared to recall all the &s;pirit of Schedoni. "She is the daughter of a noble hou&s;e, "&s;aid the Confe&s;&s;or, haughtily, while he half rai&s;ed him&s;elf from his mat|tre&s;s. "In me you behold the la&s;t of the Count's di Bruno."</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e &s;miled contemptuou&s;ly."</P>
<P>Schedoni proceeded. "I call upon you, Nicola di Zampari, who have declared your&s;elf, on a late occa&s;i|on &s;o &s;trenuous for ju&s;tice, I call upon you now to do ju&s;tice in this in&s;tance, and to acknowledge, before the&s;e witne&s;&s;es, that Ellena Ro&s;alba is innocent of every circum&s;tance of mi&s;conduct, which you have formerly related to the Marche&s;e di Vivaldi!"</P>
<P>"Villain! do you he&s;itate," &s;aid Vivaldi to Nicola, "to retract the cruel &s;landers which you have thrown upon her name, and which have been the means of de|&s;troying her peace, perhaps for ever? Do you per|&s;i&s;t&mdash;"</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e interrupted his &s;on:&mdash;</P>
<P>"Let me put an end to the difficulty, by conclud|ing the interview; I perceive that my pre&s;ence has been required for a purpo&s;e that does not concern me."</P>
<P>Before the Confe&s;&s;or could reply, the Marche&s;e had turned from him to quit the chamber; but the ve|hemence of Vivaldi's di&s;tre&s;s prevailed with him to pau&s;e, and thus allowed him to under&s;tand from Sche|doni, that the ju&s;tification of the innocent Ellena, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hough it had been mentioned fir&s;t, as being the ob|ject neare&s;t to his heart, was not the only one that had urged him to require this meeting.</P>
<P>"If you con&s;ent," added Schedoni, "to li&s;ten to the
<PB N="261" REF="032735_0551_0FF499E617C914B0">
vindication of my child, you &s;hall afterwads perceive, Signor, that I, fallen though I am, have &s;till been de|&s;irous of counteracting, as far as remains for me, the evil I, have occa&s;ioned. You &s;hall acknowledge, that what I then made known is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to the repo&s;e the of Marche&s;e di Vivaldi, high in influ|ence, and haughty in pro&s;perity as he now appears."</P>
<P>The latter part of this a&s;&s;urance threatened to over|come the effect of the fir&s;t; the pride of the Mar|che&s;e &s;welled high; he took &s;ome &s;teps towards the door, but then &s;topped, and conjecturing that the &s;ubject, to which Schedoni alluded, concerned the liberation of his &s;on, he con&s;ented to attend to what Nicola &s;hould di&s;clo&s;e.</P>
<P>This monk, meanwhile, had been balancing the nece&s;&s;ity for acknowledging him&s;elf a &s;landerer again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of avoiding it; and it was the re&s;olute manner of Vivaldi, who appeared to have no doubt as to his guilt in this in&s;tance, that made him apprehend the con&s;equence of per&s;i&s;ting in fal&s;hood, not either remor&s;e of con&s;cience, or the appeal of Schedoni. He acknowledged then, after con&s;iderable circumlocution, in which he contrived to defend him&s;elf, by throwing all the odium of the original de&s;ign upon the Con|fe&s;&s;or, that he had been prevailed upon by his arts to impo&s;e on the credulity of the Marche&s;e, re&s;pecting the conduct of Ellena di Ro&s;alba. This avowal was made upon oath, and Schedoni, by the que&s;tions he put to him, was careful it &s;hould be &s;o full and circum&s;tantial that even the mo&s;t prejudiced hearer mu&s;t be convinced of its truth; while the mo&s;t unfeeling mu&s;t have yielded for once to indig|nation again&s;t the a&s;per&s;er, and pity of the a&s;per&s;ed. Its effect upon the pre&s;ent auditors was various. The Marche&s;e had li&s;tened to the whole explanation with an unmoved countenance, but with profound attention. Vivaldi had remained in a &s;ixt attitude, with eyes
<PB N="262" REF="032735_0552_0FF49997E7728A90">
bent on father Nicola, in &s;uch eager and &s;tern regard, as &s;eemed to &s;earch into his very &s;oul; and, when the monk concluded, a &s;mile of triumphant joy lighted up his features, as he looked upon the Marche&s;e, and claimed an acknowledgment of his conviction, that Ellena had been calumniated. The cold glance, which the Marche&s;e, returned, &s;truck the impa&s;&s;ioned and generous Vivaldi to the heart, who perceived that he was not only totally indifferent as to the inju&s;tice, which an innocent and helple&s;s young woman had &s;uf|fered, but fancied that he was unwilling to admit the truth, which his judgment would no longer allow him to reject.</P>
<P>Schedoni, meanwhile, appeared almo&s;t to writhe un|der the agony, which his mind inflicted upon him, and it was only by &s;trong effort, that he &s;u&s;tained his &s;pi|rit &s;o far as to go through with the interrogations he had judged it nece&s;&s;ary to put to Nicola. When the &s;ubject was fini&s;hed, he &s;unk back on his pillow, and, clo&s;ing his eyes, a hue &s;o pallid, &s;ucceeded by one &s;o livid, over&s;pread his features, that Vivaldi for an in|&s;tant believed he was dying; and in this &s;uppo&s;ition he was not &s;ingular, for even an official was touched with the Confe&s;&s;or's condition, and had advanced to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, when he unclo&s;ed his eyes, and &s;eemed to revive.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e, without making any comment up|on the avowal of father Nicola, demanded on its con|clu&s;ion, the di&s;clo&s;ure, which Schedoni had a&s;&s;erted to be intimately connected with his peace; and the latter now inquired of a per&s;on near him, whether a &s;ecre|tary of the Inqui&s;ition was in the chamber, who he had reque&s;ted might attend, to take a formal depo&s;i|tion of what he &s;hould declare. He was an&s;wered, that &s;uch an one was already in waiting. He then, a&s;ked, what other per&s;ons were in the room, adding, that he &s;hould require Inqui&s;itorial witne&s;&s;es to his
<PB N="263" REF="032735_0553_0FF499E79D3737B0">
depo&s;ition; and was an&s;wered, that an Inqui&s;itor and two officials were pre&s;ent, and that their evidence was more than &s;ufficient for his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>A lamp was then called for by the Secretary; but, as that could not immediately be procured, the torch of one of the centinels, who watched in the dark ave|nue without, was brought in its &s;tead, and this di&s;co|vered to Schedoni the various figures a&s;&s;embled in his du&s;ky chamber, and to them the emaciated form and gha&s;tly vi&s;age of the Confe&s;&s;or. As Vivaldi now be|held him by the &s;tronger light of the torch, he again fancied that death was in his a&s;pect.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on was now ready for the declaration of Schedoni; but he him&s;elf &s;eemed not fully prepared. He remained for &s;ome moments reclining on his pil|low in &s;ilence, with his eyes &s;hut, while the changes in his features indicated the &s;trong emotion of his mind. Then, as if by a violent effort, he half rai&s;ed him&s;elf, and made an ample confe&s;&s;ion of the arts he had prac|ti&s;ed again&s;t Vivaldi. He declared him&s;elf to be the anonimous accu&s;er who had cau&s;ed him to be ar|re&s;ted by the Holy-Office, and that the charge of here|&s;y, which he had brought again&s;t him, was fal&s;e and malicious.</P>
<P>At the moment when Vivaldi received this confir|mation of his &s;u&s;picions, as to the identity of his accu|&s;er, he di&s;covered more fully that the charge was not what had been &s;tated to him at the chapel of San Se|ba&s;tian, in which Ellena was implicated; and he de|manded an explanation of this circum&s;tance. Sche|doni acknowledged, that the per&s;ons, who had there arre&s;ted him, were not officers of the inqui&s;ition, and that the in&s;trument of arre&s;t, containing the charge of elopement with a nun, was forged by him&s;elf, for the purpo&s;e of empowering the ruffians to carry off Elle|na without oppo&s;ition from the inhabitants of the con|vent, in which &s;he was then lodged.</P>
<P>To Vivaldi's enquiry, why it had been thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="264" REF="032735_0554_0FF499996DCD76C0">
to employ &s;tratagem in the removal of Ellena, &s;ince, if Schedoni had only claimed her for his daugh|ter, he might have removed her without any, the Con|fe&s;&s;or replied, that he was then ignorant of the rela|tion&s;hip which exi&s;ted between them. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t to the fur|ther enquiries, with what de&s;ign, and whither Ellena had been removed, and the means by which he had di&s;covered her to be his daughter, Schedoni was &s;ilent; and he &s;unk back, overwhelmed by the recollections they awakened.</P>
<P>The depo&s;itions of Schedoni having been taken down by the Secretary, were formally &s;igned by the Inqui&s;itor and the officials pre&s;ent; and Vivaldi thus &s;aw his innocence vindicated by the very man who had thrown him among the perils of the Inqui&s;ition. But the near pro&s;pect or relea&s;e now before him failed to affect him with joy, while he under&s;tood that El|lena was the daughter of Schedoni, the child of a murderer, whom he him&s;elf had been, in &s;ome degree, in&s;trumental in bringing to a dreadful and ignomi|nous death. Still, however, willing to hope, that Schedoni had not &s;poken the truth concerning his relation&s;hip to Ellena he claimed, in con&s;ideration of the affection he had &s;o long cheri&s;hed for her, a full explanation of the circum&s;tance connected with the di&s;covery of her family.</P>
<P>At this public avowed of his attachment, a haughty impatience appeared on the countenance of the Mar|che&s;e, who forbade him to make further enquiry on the &s;ubject, and was immediately retiring from the chamber.</P>
<P>"My pre&s;ence is no longer nece&s;&s;ary," he added: "the pri&s;oner has concluded the only detail which I could be intere&s;ted to hear from him; and, in con&s;i|deration of the confe&s;&s;ion he has made as to the inno|cence of my &s;on, I pardon him the &s;uffering, which his fal&s;e charge has occa&s;ioned to me and my family
<PB N="265" REF="032735_0555_0FF499E92354EC00">
The paper containing his depo&s;itions is given to your re&s;pon&s;ibility, holy father," addre&s;&s;ing the Inqui|&s;itor; "and you are required to lay it upon the table of the Holy Office, that the innocence of Vincentio di Vivaldi may appear, and that he may be relea&s;ed from the&s;e pri&s;ons without further delay. But fir&s;t I demand a copy of tho&s;e declarations, and that the copy al&s;o &s;hall be &s;igned by the pre&s;ent witne&s;&s;es."</P>
<P>The &s;ecretary was now bidden to copy them, and, while the Marche&s;e waited to receive the paper, (for he would not leave the chamber till he had &s;ecured it) Vivaldi was urging his claim for an explanation re&s;|pecting the family of Ellena, with unconquerable per|&s;everance. Schedoni, no longer permitted to evade the inquiry, could not, however, give a circum&s;tantial explanation, without partly di&s;clo&s;ing, al&s;o, the fatal de&s;igns which had been meditated by him and the late Marche&s;a di Vivaldi, of who&s;e death he was ignorant; he related, therefore, little more re&s;pecting Ellena than that a portrait, which &s;he wore as being her father's, had fir&s;t led to the di&s;covery of her family.</P>
<P>While the Confe&s;&s;or had been giving this brief ex|planation, Nicola, who was &s;omewhat withdrawn from the circle, &s;tood gazing at him with the malignity of a demon. His glowing eyes ju&s;t appeared under the edge of his cowl, while, rolled up in his dark drape|ry, the lower features of his face were muffled; but the intermediate part of his countenance, receiving the full glare of the torch, di&s;played all its &s;peaking and terrific lines. Vivaldi, as his eye glanced upon him, &s;aw again the very monk of Paluzzi, and he thought he beheld al&s;o a man capable of the very crimes of which he had accu&s;ed Schedoni. At this in&s;tant he remem|bered the dreadful garment that had been di&s;covered in a dungeon of the fortre&s;s; and, yet more, he remem|bered the extraordinary circum&s;tances attending the death of Bianchi, together with the immediate know|ledge which the monk had di&s;played of that event. Vi|valdi's
<PB N="266" REF="032735_0556_0FF4999AF54B3040">
&s;u&s;picions re&s;pecting the cau&s;e of her death, being thus revived, he determined to obtain, if po&s;&s;i|ble, either a relief from or a confirmation of them; and he &s;olemnly called upon Schedoni, who, already condemned to die, had no longer any thing to fear from a di&s;clo&s;ure of the truth, whatever it might be to de|clare all that he knew on the &s;ubject. As he did &s;o, he looked at Nicola, to ob&s;erve the effect of this de|mand, who&s;e countenance was, however, &s;o much &s;hrouded, that little of its expre&s;&s;ion could be &s;een; but Vivaldi remarked, that while he had &s;poken, the monk drew his garment clo&s;er over the lower part of his face, and that he had immediately turned his eyes from him upon the Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>With mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tations, Schedoni declared him&s;elf to be both innocent and ignorant of the cau&s;e of Bianchi's death.</P>
<P>Vivaldi then demanded by what means his agent, Nicola, had obtained &s;uch immediate information, as the warning he had delivered at Paluzzi proved him to have, of an event, in which it appeared that he could be &s;o little intere&s;ted; and why that warning had been given.</P>
<P>Nicola did not attempt to anticipate the reply of Schedoni, who, after a momentary &s;ilence, &s;aid, "That warning, young man, was given to deter you from vi&s;iting Altieri, as was every circum&s;tance of ad|vice or intelligence, which you received beneath the arch of Paluzzi."</P>
<P>"Father," replied Vivaldi, "you have never loved, or you would have &s;pared your&s;elf the practice of arti|fices &s;o ineffectual to mi&s;lead or to conquer a lover. Did you believe that an anonymous advi&s;er could have more influence with me than my affection, or that I could be terrified by &s;uch &s;tratagems into a renuncia|tion of its object?"</P>
<P>"I believed," rejoined the Confe&s;&s;or, "that the di&s;intere&s;ted advice if a &s;tranger might have &s;ome
<PB N="267" REF="032735_0557_0FF499F4753EDC00">
weight with you; but I tru&s;ted more to the impre&s;|&s;ion of awe, which the conduct and &s;eeming fore|knowledge of that &s;tranger were adapted to in&s;pire in a mind like your's; and I thus endeavoured to avail my&s;elf of your prevailing weakne&s;s."</P>
<P>"And what do you term my prevailing weakne&s;s?" &s;aid Vivaldi, blu&s;hing.</P>
<P>"A &s;u&s;ceptibility which renders you e&s;pecially lia|ble to &s;uper&s;tition," replied Schedoni.</P>
<P>"What! does a monk call &s;uper&s;tition a weak|ne&s;s!" rejoined Vivaldi. "But grant he does, on what occa&s;ion have I betrayed &s;uch weakne&s;s?"</P>
<P>"Have you forgotten a conver&s;ation which I once held with you on invi&s;ible &s;pirits?" &s;aid Schedoni.</P>
<P>As he a&s;ked this, Vivaldi was &s;truck with the tone of his voice; he thought it was different from what he had remembered ever to have heard from him; and he looked at Schedoni more intently, that he might be certain it was he who had &s;poken. The Confe&s;&s;or's eyes were fixed upon him, and the repeated &s;lowly in the &s;ame tone, "Have you forgotten?</P>
<P>"I have not forgotten the conver&s;ation to which you allude," replied Vivaldi, "and I do not recollect that I then di&s;clo&s;ed any opinion that may ju&s;tify your a&s;&s;ertion."</P>
<P>"The opinions you avowed were rational," &s;aid Schedoni, "but the ardour of your imagination was apparent, and what ardent imagination ever was con|tended to tru&s;t to plain rea&s;oning, or to the evidence of the &s;en&s;es? It may not willingly confine it&s;elf to the dull truths, of this earth, but, eager to expand its facul|ties, to fill its capacity, and to experience its own pe|culiar delights, &s;oars after new wonders into a world of its own!"</P>
<P>Vivivaldi blu&s;hed at this reproof, now con&s;cious of its ju&s;tne&s;s; and was &s;urpri&s;ed that Schedoni &s;hould &s;o well have under&s;tood the nature of his mind, while he him&s;elf, with whom conjecture had never a&s;&s;umed
<PB N="268" REF="032735_0558_0FF499A4852DD610">
the &s;tability of opinion, on the &s;ubject to which the Confe&s;&s;or alluded, had been ignorant even of its pro|pen&s;ities,</P>
<P>"I acknowledge the truth of your remark," &s;aid Vi|valdi, "as far as it concerns my&s;elf. I have, however, enquiries to make on a point le&s;s ab&s;tracted, and to|wards explaining which the evidence of my &s;en&s;es them|&s;elves have done little. To whom belonged the bloody garments, I found in the dungeon of Paluzzi, and what became of the per&s;on to whom they had pertained?</P>
<P>Con&s;ternation appeared for an in&s;tant on the fea|tures of Schedoni. "What garments?" &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"They appeared to be the&s;e of a per&s;on who had died by violence," replied Vivaldi, "and they were di&s;covered in a place frequented by your avowed a|gent, Nicola the monk."</P>
<P>As he concluded the &s;entence, Vivaldi looked at Nicola, upon whom the attention of every per&s;on pre&s;ent now directed.</P>
<P>"They were my own," &s;aid this monk.</P>
<P>"Your own! and in that condition!&punc; exclaimed Vivaldi. "They were covered with gore!"</P>
<P>"They were my own." repeated Nicola. "For their condition, I have to thank you,&mdash;the wound your pi&s;tol gave me occa&s;ioned it."</P>
<P>Vivaldi was a&s;toni&s;hed by this apparent &s;ubterfuge. "I had no pi&s;tol," he rejoined, "my &s;word was my only weapon!"</P>
<P>"Pau&s;e a moment," &s;aid the monk.</P>
<P>"I repeat that I had no fire-arms," replied Vi|valdi.</P>
<P>"I appeal to father Schedoni&punc;' rejoined Nicola, "whether I was not wounded by a pi&s;tol &s;hot."</P>
<P>"To me you have no longer any right of appeal," &s;aid Schedoni. "Why &s;hould I &s;ave you from &s;u&s;|picions, that may bring you to a &s;tate like this, to which you have reduced me!"</P>
<P>"Your crimes have reduced you to it," replied
<PB N="269" REF="032735_0559_0FF499F612B20E78">
Nicola, "I have only done my duty, and that which another per&s;on could have affected without my aid&mdash;the prie&s;t to whom Spalatro made his la&s;t confe&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"It is, however a duty of &s;uch a kind," ob&s;erved Vivaldi, "as I would not willingly have upon my con&s;cience. You have betrayed the life of your for|mer friend, and have compelled me to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the de&s;|truction of a fellow being,"</P>
<P>"You, like me, have a&s;&s;i&s;ted to de&s;troy a de&s;troy|er," replied the monk. "He has taken life, and de|&s;erves, therefore, to lo&s;e it. If, however, it will af|ford you con&s;olation to know that you have not mate|rially a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;truction, I will hereafter give you proof for this a&s;&s;urance. There were other means of &s;hewing that Schedoni was the Count di Bruno, than the te&s;timony of An&s;aldo, though I was ignorant of them when I bade you &s;ummon the penitentiary."</P>
<P>"If you had &s;ooner avowed this," &s;aid Vivaldi, "the a&s;&s;ertion would have been more plau&s;ible. Now, I can only under&s;tand that it is de&s;igned to win my &s;ilence, and pre&s;ent my retorting upon you your own maxim&mdash;that he who has taken the life of another de|&s;erves to loo&s;e his own. To whom did tho&s;e bloody garments belong?"</P>
<P>"To my&s;elf, I repeat," &s;aid Nicola, "Schedoni can bear te&s;timony that I received at Paluzzi a pi&s;tol wound"</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible", &s;aid Vivaldi, "I was armed only with my &s;word!"</P>
<P>"You had a companion," ob&s;erved the monk, "had not he fire-arms?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi, after a momentary con&s;ideration, recollect|ed that Paulo had pi&s;tols, and that he had fired one be|neath the arch of Paluzzi, on the fir&s;t alarm occa&s;ion|ed by the &s;trangers voice. He immediately acknow|ledged the recollection. "But I heard no groan, no &s;ymptom of di&s;tre&s;s!" he added. "Be&s;ides, the gar|ments were at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;pot
<PB N="270" REF="032735_0560_0FF499A60D4723B0">
where the pi&s;tol was fired! How could a per&s;on, &s;o &s;everely wounded as tho&s;e garments indicated, have &s;ilently withdrawn to a remote dungeon, or, having done &s;o, is it probable he would have thrown a&s;ide his dre&s;s!"</P>
<P>"All that is neverthele&s;s true," replied Nicola. "My re&s;olution enabled me to &s;tifle the expre&s;&s;ion of my angui&s;h; I withdrew to the interior of the ruin, to e&s;cape from you, but you pur&s;ued me even to the dun|geon, where I threw off my di&s;coloured ve&s;tments, in which I dared not return to my convent, and depart|ed by a way which all your ingenuity failed to di&s;co|ver. The people who were already in the fort, for the purpo&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;ting to confine you and your &s;ervant during the night on which Signora Ro&s;alba was tak|en from Altieri, procured me another habit, and relief for my wound. But, though I was un&s;een by you during the night, I was not entirely unheard, for my groans reached you more than once from an adjoining chamber, and my companions were entertained with the alarm which your &s;ervant te&s;tified.&mdash;Are you now convinced?"</P>
<P>The groans were clearly remembered by Vivaldi, and many other circum&s;tances of Nicola's narration accorded &s;o well with others, which he recollected to have occurred on the night alluded to, that he had no longer a doubt of its veracity. The &s;uddenne&s;s of Bianchi's death, however, &s;till occa&s;ioned him &s;u&s;pi|cions as to its cau&s;e; yet Schedoni had declared not only that he was innocent, but ignorant of this cau&s;e, which it appeared from his unwillingne&s;s to give te&s;|timony in favour of his agent, he would not have af|firmed, had he been con&s;cious that the monk was in any degree guilty in this in&s;tance. That Nicola could have no inducement for attempting the life of Bianchi other than a reward offered him by Schedoni, was clear; and Vivaldi, after more fully con&s;idering the&s;e circum&s;tances, become convinced that her death
<PB N="271" REF="032735_0561_0FF499F79AE7C1A0">
was in con&s;equence of &s;ome accident or natural decay.</P>
<P>While this conver&s;ation was pa&s;&s;ing, the Marche&s;e, impatient to put a conclu&s;ion to it, and to leave the chamber, repeatedly urged the &s;ecretary to di&s;patch; and, while he now earne&s;tly renewed his reque&s;t, an|other voice an&s;wered for the &s;ecretary, that he had nearly concluded. Vivaldi thought that he had heard the voice on &s;ome former occa&s;ion, and on turning his eyes upon the per&s;on who had &s;poken, di&s;covered the &s;tranger to be the &s;ame who had fir&s;t vi&s;ited him in pri&s;on. Perceiving by his dre&s;s, that he was an officer of the Inqui&s;ition, Vivaldi now under&s;tood too well the purport of his former vi&s;it, and that he had come with a de&s;ign to betray him by affected &s;ympathy into a confe&s;&s;ion of &s;ome heretical opinions. Similar in|&s;tances of treachery Vivaldi had heard were frequent|ly practi&s;ed upon accu&s;ed per&s;ons, but he had never fully believed &s;uch cruelty po&s;&s;ible till now, that it had been attempted towards him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The vi&s;it of this per&s;on bringing to his recollection the &s;ub&s;equent one he had received from Nicola, Vivaldi inquired whether the centinels had really ad|mitted him to his cell, or he had entered it by other means! a que&s;tion to which the monk was &s;ilent, but the &s;mile on his features, if &s;o &s;trange an expre&s;&s;ion de&s;erved to be called a &s;mile, &s;eemed to reply, "Do you believe that I, a &s;ervant of the Inqui&s;ition, will be|tray its &s;ecrets?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi, however, urged the inquiry, for he wi&s;hed to know whether the guard, who appeared to be faith|ful to their office, had e&s;caped the puni&s;hment that was threatened.</P>
<P>"They were hone&s;t," replied Nicola, "&s;eek no fur||ther."</P>
<P>"Are the tribunal convinced of their integrity?"</P>
<P>Nicola &s;miled again in deri&s;on, and replied, "They never doubted it."</P>
<P>"How!" &s;aid Vivaldi. "Why were the&s;e men
<PB N="272" REF="032735_0562_0FF499A7944A3E90">
put under arre&s;t, if their faithfulne&s;s was not even &s;u&s;|pected?"</P>
<P>"Be &s;atisfied with the knowledge, which experi|ence has given you of the &s;ecrets of the Inqui&s;ition," replied Nicola &s;olemnly, "&s;eek to know no more!"</P>
<P>"It has terrible &s;ecrets!" &s;aid Schedoni, who had been long &s;ilent. "Know, young man, that almo&s;t every cell of every pri&s;oner has a concealed entrance, by which the mini&s;ters of death may pa&s;s unnoticed to their victims. This Nicola is now one of tho&s;e dread|ful &s;ummoners, and is acquainted with all the &s;ecret avenues, that lead to murder."</P>
<P>Vivaldi &s;hrunk from Nicola in horror, and Schedo|ni pau&s;ed; but while he had &s;poken, Vivaldi had again noticed the extraordinary change in his voice, and &s;huddered at its &s;ound no le&s;s than at the information it had given. Nicola was &s;ilent; but his terrible eyes were fixed in vengeance on Schedoni.</P>
<P>"His office has been &s;hort," re&s;umed the Confe&s;|&s;or, turning his heavy eyes upon Nicola, "and his ta&s;k is almo&s;t done!" As he pronounced the la&s;t words, his voice faultered, but they were heard by the monk, who drawing nearer to the bed demanded an explana|tion of them. A gha&s;tly &s;mile triumphed in the fea|tures of Schedoni; "Fear not but that an explanation will come full &s;oon," &s;aid he.</P>
<P>Nicola fixed him&s;elf before the Confe&s;&s;or, and bent his brows upon him as if he would have &s;earched into his very &s;oul, When Vivaldi again looked at Sche|doni, he was &s;hocked on ob&s;erving the &s;udden altera|tion in his countenance, yet &s;till a faint &s;mile of tri|umph lingered there. But, while Vivaldi gazed, the features &s;uddenly became agitated: in the next in&s;tant his whole frame was convul&s;ed, and heavy groans la|boured from his brea&s;t. Schedoni was now evidently dying.</P>
<P>The honour of Vivaldi, and of the Marche&s;e, who endeavouring to leave the chamber, was equalled only
<PB N="273" REF="032735_0563_0FF499F92250FD08">
by the general confu&s;ion that reigned there; every per|&s;on pre&s;ent &s;eemed to feel at lea&s;t a momentary com|pa&s;&s;ion, except Nicola, who &s;tood unmoved, be&s;ide Schedoni, and looked &s;tedfa&s;tly upon his pangs, while a &s;mile of deri&s;on marked his countenance. As Vi|valdi ob&s;erved, with dete&s;tation, this expre&s;&s;ion, a &s;light &s;pa&s;m darted over Nicola's face, and his mu&s;cles al&s;o &s;eemed to labour with &s;udden contraction; but the af|fection was tran&s;ient, and vani&s;hed as abruptly as it had appeared. The monk, however, turned from the mi&s;erable &s;pectacle before him, and as he turned he caught involuntarily at the arm of a per&s;on near him, and leaned on his &s;houlder for &s;upport. His manner appeared to betray that he had not been permitted to triumph in the &s;ufferings of his enemy, without parti|cipating at lea&s;t in their horror.</P>
<P>Schedoni's &s;truggles now began to abate, and in a &s;hort time he lay motionle&s;s. When he unclo&s;ed his eyes, death was in them. He was yet nearly in&s;en&s;ible; but pre&s;ently a faint gleam of recollection &s;hot from them, and gradually lighting them up, the character of his &s;oul appeared there; the expre&s;&s;ion was indeed fee|ble, but it was true. He moved his lips as if he would have &s;poken, and looked languidly round the chamber, &s;eemingly in &s;earch of &s;ome per&s;on. At length, he uttered a &s;ound but he had not yet &s;ufficient command of his mu&s;cles, to modulate that &s;ound into a word, till by repeated efforts the name of Nicola be|came intelligible. At the call, the monk rai&s;ed his head from the &s;houlder of the per&s;on on whom he had reclined, and turning round, Schedoni, as was evident from the &s;udden change of expre&s;&s;ion in his counte|nance, di&s;covered him; his eyes, as they &s;ettled on Ni|cola &s;eemed to recollect all their wonted fire, and the malignant triumph, lately &s;o prevalent in his phy&s;iog|nomy, again appeared as in the next moment, he point|ed to him. His glance &s;eemed &s;uddenly impowered with the de&s;tructive fa&s;cination attributed to that of
<PB N="274" REF="032735_0564_0FF499A91A67DB70">
the ba&s;ili&s;k, for while it now met Nicola's that monk &s;eemed as if transfixed to the &s;pot, and unable to with|draw his eyes from the glare of Schedoni's; in their expre&s;&s;ion he read the dreadful &s;entence of his fate, the triumph of revenge and cunning. Struck with this terrible conviction, a pallid hue over&s;pread his face; at the &s;ame time an involuntary motion convul&s;ed his features, cold trembling &s;eized open his frame, and, uttering a deep groan, he fell back, and was caught in the arms of the people near him. At the in&s;tant of his fall, Schedoni uttered a &s;ound &s;o &s;trange and horrible, &s;o convul&s;ed, yet &s;o loud, &s;o exulting, yet &s;o unlike any human voice, that every per&s;on in the chamber, except tho&s;e who were a&s;&s;i&s;ting Nicola, &s;truck with irre&s;i&s;table terror, endeavoured to make their way out of it. This, however, was impracticable, for the door was fa&s;tened, until a phy&s;ician, who had been &s;ent for, &s;hould arrive, and &s;ome inve&s;tigation could be made into this my&s;terious affair. The con&s;ternation of the Marche&s;e and of Vivaldi, compelled to witne&s;s this &s;cene of horror, cannot ea&s;ily be imagined.</P>
<P>Schedoni, having uttered that demonical &s;ound of exultation, was not permitted to repeat it, for the pangs he had lately &s;uffered, returned upon him, and he was again in &s;trong convul&s;ions, when the phy&s;ician en|tered the chamber. The moment he beheld Schedoni, he declared him to be poi&s;oned; and he pronounced a &s;imilar opinion on father Nicola<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> affirming, al&s;o, that the drug, as appeared from the violence of the effect, was of two &s;ubtle and inveterate a nature to allow of antidote. He was however, willing to admini&s;ter the medicine u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es.</P>
<P>While he was giving orders to an attendant, with re&s;pect to this, the violence of Schedoni' convul&s;ions once more relaxed; but Nicola appeared in the la&s;t extremity. His &s;ufferings were, ince&s;&s;ant, his &s;en&s;es never for a moment returned, and he expired, before the medicine, which had been &s;ent for, could he
<PB N="275" REF="032735_0565_0FF49A052BF71C98">
brought. When it came, however, it was admini|&s;tered with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s to Schedoni, who recovered not only his recollection, but his voice; and the fir&s;t word he uttered was, as formerly, the name of Nicola.</P>
<P>"Does he live? added the Confe&s;&s;or with the ut|mo&s;t difficulty, and after a long pau&s;e. The per&s;ons around him were &s;ilent, but the truth, which this &s;i|lence indicated, &s;eemed to revive him.</P>
<P>The inqui&s;itor, who had attended, perceiving that Schedoni had recovered the u&s;e of his intellects, now judged it prudent to a&s;k &s;ome que&s;tions relative to his pre&s;ent condition, and to the cau&s;e of Nicola's death.</P>
<P>"Poi&s;on," replied Schedoni readily.</P>
<P>"By whom admini&s;tered?" &s;aid the inqui&s;itor, "con&s;ider that while you an&s;wer, you are on your death-bed."</P>
<P>"I have no wi&s;h to conceal the truth," rejoined Schedoni, "nor the &s;atisfaction"&mdash;he was obliged to cau&s;e, but pre&s;ently added, "I have de&s;troyed him, who would have de&s;troyed me, and&mdash;and I have e&s;|caped an ignominous death."</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed again; it was with difficulty that he had &s;aid thus much, and he was now overcome by the ex|ertion he had made. The &s;ecretary, who had not been permitted to leave the chamber, was ordered to note Schedoni's words.</P>
<P>"You avow then," continued the Inqui&s;itor, "that the poi&s;on was admini&s;tered, both in the ca&s;e of father Nicola, and in your own, by your&s;elf?"</P>
<P>Schedoni could not immediately reply; but when he did he &s;aid "I avow it."</P>
<P>He was a&s;ked by what means he had contrived to procure the poi&s;on, and was bidden to name his accom|plice.</P>
<P>"I had no accomplice," replied Schedoni.</P>
<P>"How did you procure the poi&s;on then?"</P>
<P>Schedoni, &s;lowly and with difficulty, replied, "It was concealed in my ve&s;t."</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="032735_0566_0FF499B484261E58">
"Con&s;ider that you are dying," &s;aid the inqui&s;itor, "and confe&s;s the truth. We cannot believe what you, have la&s;t a&s;&s;erted. It is improbable that you &s;hould have had an opportunity of providing your&s;elf with poi|&s;on after your arre&s;t, and equally improbable that you &s;hould have thought &s;uch provi&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary before that period. Confe&s;s who is your accomplice.'</P>
<P>This accu&s;ation of fal&s;ehood recalled the &s;pirit of Schedoni, which, contending with, and conquering, for a moment, corporeal &s;uffering, he &s;aid in a firmer tone, "It was the per&s;on, in which I dip my poig|nard, the better to defend me."</P>
<P>The Inqui&s;itor &s;miled in contempt of this explana|tion, and Schedoni, ob&s;erving him, de&s;ired a particular part of his ve&s;t might be examined, where would be found &s;ome remains of the drug concealed as he had affirmed. He was indulged in his reque&s;t, and the poi&s;on was di&s;covered within the broad hem of his gar|ment.</P>
<P>Still it was inconceivable how he had contrived to admini&s;ter it to Nicola, who, though he had been for &s;ome time alone with him on this day, would &s;carcely have &s;o far confided in an enemy, as to have accept|ed any &s;ee|ming &s;u&s;tenance that might have been offered by him. The Inqui&s;itor, &s;till anxious to di&s;cover an accomplice, a&s;ked Schedoni who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted to ad|mini&s;ter the drug to Nicola, but the Confe&s;&s;or was no longer in a condition to reply. Life was now &s;ink|ing a pace: the gleam of &s;pirit and of character that had returned to his eyes, was departed, and left them haggard and fixed; and pre&s;ently a lived corp&s;e was all that remained of the once terrible Schedoni!</P>
<P>While this awful event had been accompli&s;hing, the Marche&s;e, &s;uffering under the utmo&s;t perturbation, had withdrawn, to the di&s;tant grate of the dungeon, where he conver&s;ed with an official as to what might be the probable con&s;equence of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation to him&s;elf; but Vivaldi, in an agony of horror, had been
<PB N="277" REF="032735_0567_0FF49A06B1AC33A8">
calling ince&s;&s;antly for the medicine, which might po&s;|&s;ibly afford &s;ome relief to the angui&s;h he witne&s;&s;ed; when it was brought, he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;upport the &s;ufferers.</P>
<P>At length, now that the wor&s;t was over, and when &s;everal witne&s;&s;es had &s;igned to the la&s;t avowal of Sche|doni, every per&s;on in the chamber was &s;uffered to de|part; and Vivaldi was reconducted to his pri&s;on, ac|companied by the Marche&s;e, where he was to remain till the deci&s;ion of the holy office re&s;pecting his in|nocence, as a&s;&s;erted by the depo&s;ition of Schedoni, &s;hould be known. He was too much affected by the late &s;cene to give the Marche&s;e any explanation at pre|&s;ent, re&s;pecting the family of Ellena di Ro&s;alba, and the Marche&s;e, having remained for &s;ome time with his &s;on, withdrew to the re&s;idence of his friend.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN con&s;equence of the dying confe&s;&s;ion of Schedo|ni, an order was &s;ent from the holy office for the re|lea&s;e of Vivaldi, within a few days after the death of the Confe&s;&s;or; and the Marche&s;e conducted his &s;on from the pri&s;ons of the inqui&s;ition to the man&s;ion of his friend the Count di Maro, with whom he had re&s;ided &s;ince his arrival at Rome.</P>
<P>While they were receiving the ceremonious con|gratulations of the Count, and of &s;ome nobles a&s;&s;em|bled to welcome the emancipated pri&s;oner, a loud voice was heard from the anti-chamber exclaiming, "Let me pa&s;s! It is my Ma&s;ter, let me pa&s;s! May all tho&s;e who attempt to &s;top me, be &s;ent to the Inqui&s;ition them&s;elves!"</P>
<P>In the next in&s;tant Paulo bur&s;t into the &s;aloon, followed by a group of lacqueys, who, however, pau&s;ed at the door, fearful of the di&s;plea&s;ure of their lord, yet &s;carcely able to &s;tifle a laugh; while Paulo, &s;pringing forward, had nearly over&s;e &s;ome of the com|pany, who happened at that moment to be bowing with profound joy to Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"It is my ma&s;ter! it is my ma&s;ter!" cried Paulo, and, &s;ending off a nobleman with each elbow, as he made his way between them, he hugged Vivaldi in his arms, repeating, "O, my ma&s;ter! my ma&s;ter!" till a a pa&s;&s;ion of joy and affection overcame his voice and he fell at his ma&s;ter's feet and wept.</P>
<P>This was a moment of finer joy to Vivaldi, than he had known &s;ince his meeting with his father, and he
<PB N="279" REF="032735_0569_0FF49A0837E3E068">
was too much intere&s;ted by his faithful &s;ervant, to have lei&s;ure to apoligize to the a&s;toni&s;hed company for his rudene&s;s. While the lacqueys were repairing the mi&s;chief Paulo had occa&s;ioned, were picking up the rolling &s;nuff-boxes he had jerked away in his pa&s;&s;age, and wiping the &s;nuff from the &s;oiled clothes, Vivaldi was participating in all the delight, and returning all the affection of his &s;ervant, and was &s;o wholly occupi|ed by the&s;e plea&s;urable feelings as &s;carcely to be &s;en&s;i|ble that any per&s;ons, be&s;ides them&s;elves, were in the room. The Marche&s;e, meanwhile, was making a thou&s;and apologies for the di&s;a&s;ters Paulo had occa&s;i|oned; was alternately calling upon him to recollect in who&s;e pre&s;ence he was, and to quit the apartment immediately: explaining to the company that he had not &s;een Vivaldi &s;ince they were together in the inqui|&s;ition and remarking profoundly, that he was much attached to his ma&s;ter. But Paulo, in&s;en&s;ible to the repeated commands of the Marche&s;e, and to the en|deavours of Vivaldi to rai&s;e him, was &s;till pouring forth his whole heart at his ma&s;ter's feet. "Ah! my Signor," &s;aid he, "If you could but know how mi&s;|rable I was when I got out of the inqui&s;ition!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"He raves!" ob&s;erved the count to the Marche&s;e, "you perceive that joy had rendered him delirious!"</P>
<P>"How I wandered about the walls half the night, and what it co&s;t me to leave them! But when I lo&s;t &s;ight of them, Signor, O! San Dominico! I thought my heart would have broke. I had a great mind to have gone back again and given my&s;elf up: and per|haps, &s;hould I too, if it had not been for my friend, the centinel, who e&s;caped with me, and I would not do him an injury, poor fellow! for he meant nothing but kindne&s;s when he let me out. And &s;ure enough, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> has proved, it was all for the be&s;t, for now I am here, too, Signor, as well as you; and can tell you all I felt when I believed I &s;hould never &s;ee you again."</P>
<P>The contra&s;t of his pre&s;ent joy, to his remembered
<PB N="208" REF="032735_0570_0FF499B78F4CD308">
grief, again brought tears into Paulo's eyes: he &s;miled and wept, and &s;obbed and laughed with &s;uch rapid tran&s;ition, that Vivaldi began to be alarmed for him; when, &s;uddenly becoming calm, he looked up in his ma&s;ter's face, and &s;aid gravely, but with eagerne&s;s, "Pray Signor, was nor the roof of your little pri&s;on peaked, and was there not a little turret &s;tuck up at one corner of it? and was there not a battlement round the turret? and was there not"&mdash;Vivaldi, after regarding him for a moment, replied &s;milingly, "Why, truly, my good Paulo, my dungeon was &s;o far from the roof, that I never had an opportunity of ob&s;erving it."</P>
<P>"This is very true Signor." replied Paulo, "very true, indeed; but I did not happen to think of that. I am certain, though it was as I &s;ay, and I was &s;ure of it at the time. O Signor! I thought that roof would have broke my heart, O how I did look at it! and now to think that I am here, with my dear ma&s;ter once a|gain!"</P>
<P>As Paulo concluded, his tears and &s;obs returned with more violence than before; and Vivaldi, who could not perceive any nece&s;&s;ary connection between this mention of the roof of his late pri&s;on, and tee joy his &s;ervant expre&s;&s;ed on &s;eeing him again, began to fear that his &s;en&s;es were bewildered, and de&s;ired an ex|planation of his words. Paulo's account, rude and &s;imple as it was, &s;oon di&s;covered to him the relation of the&s;e apparently heterogeneous circum&s;tances to each other; when Vivaldi, overcome by this new in&s;tance of the power of Paulo's affection, embraced him with his whole heart, and compelling him to ri&s;e, pre|&s;ented him to the a&s;&s;embly as his faithful friend and chief deliverer.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e affected by the &s;ome he had wit|ne&s;&s;ed, and with the truth of Vivaldi's words, conde|&s;cended to give Paulo a hearty &s;hake by the hard, and to thank him warmly for the bravery and fidelity he
<PB N="281" REF="032735_0571_0FF49A09C2BCD610">
had di&s;played in his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t. "I never can fully reward your attachment, added the Marche&s;e, "but what remains for me to do, &s;hall be done. From this moment I make you independent, and promi&s;e in the pre&s;ence of this noble company, to give you a thou&s;and &s;equins as &s;ome acknowledgment of your &s;er|vices."</P>
<P>Paulo did not expre&s;s all the gratitude for this gift which the Marche&s;e expected. He &s;tammered, and bowed and blu&s;hed, and at length bur&s;t into tears; and when Vivaldi inquired what di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him, he replied, "Why, Signor, of what u&s;e are the thou&s;and, &s;equins to me, if I am to be independent! what u&s;e if I am not to &s;tay with you?"</P>
<P>Vivaldi cordially a&s;&s;ured Paulo, that he &s;hould al|ways remain with him, and that he &s;hould con&s;ider it as his duty to render his future life happy. "You &s;hall henceforth," added Vivaldi, "be placed at the head of my hou&s;hold; the management of my &s;ervants, and the whole conduct of my dome&s;tic concerns &s;hall be committed to you, as a proof of my entire confi|dence in your integrity and attachment; and becau&s;e this is a &s;ituation which will allow you to be always near me."</P>
<P>"Thank you, my Signor," replied Paulo, in a voice rendered almo&s;t inarticulate by his gratitude, "Thank you with my whole heart! if I &s;tay with you, that is enough for me, I a&s;k no more. But I hope my Lord Marche&s;e will not think me ungrate|ful for refu&s;ing to accept of the thou&s;and &s;equins he was &s;o kind as to offer me, if I would be but independent, for I thank him as much as if I had received them, and a great deal more too."</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e, &s;miling at Paulo's mi&s;take, rejoin|ed, "As I do not perceive, my good friend, how your remaining with your ma&s;ter can be a circum&s;tance to di&s;qualify you from accepting a thou&s;and &s;equins, I command you, on pain of my di&s;plea&s;ures, to receive
<PB N="282" REF="032735_0572_0FF499B914DCC648">
them; and whenever you marry, I &s;hall expect that you will &s;hew your obedience to me again, by accept|ing another thou&s;and from me with your wife, as her dower."</P>
<P>"This is too much, Signor," &s;aid Paulo, &s;obbing&mdash;"too much to be borne!" and ran out of the &s;aloon. But amid&s;t the murmur of applau&s;e which his con|duct drew from the noble &s;pectators, for Paulo's warm heart had &s;ubdued even the coldne&s;s of their pride, a convul&s;ive &s;ound from the anti-chamber betrayed the exce&s;s of emotion, which he had thus abruptly with|drawn him&s;elf to conceal.</P>
<P>In a few hours, the Marche&s;e and Vivaldi took leave of their friends, and &s;et out for Naples, where they arrived, without any interruption, on the fourth day. But it was a melancholy journey to Vivaldi, notwith&s;tanding the joy of his late e&s;cape; for the Marche&s;e having introduced the mention of his at|tachment to Ellena di Ro&s;alba, informed him, that, under the pre&s;ent unfore&s;een circum&s;tances, he could not con&s;ider his late engagement to the Marche&s;a on that &s;ubject binding, and that Vivaldi mu&s;t relinqui&s;h Ellena, if it &s;hould appear that &s;he really was the daughter of the late Schedoni.</P>
<P>Immediately on his arrival at Naples, however, Vi|valdi, with a degree of impatience, to which his utmo&s;t &s;peed was inadequate, and with a revived joy &s;o pow|erful as to overcome every fear, and every melancho|ly con&s;ideration, which the late conver&s;ation with his father had occa&s;ioned, ha&s;tened to the <HI>Santa della Pieta.</HI></P>
<P>Ellena heard his voice from the grate, enquiring for her of a nun, who was in the parlour, and in the next in&s;tant they, beheld each other yet once again.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a meeting, after the long uncertainty and terror which each had &s;uffered for the fate of the other, and the dangers and hard&s;hips they had really incur|red, joy was exalted almo&s;t to agony. Ellena wept,
<PB N="283" REF="032735_0573_0FF46ED5787D9410">
and &s;ome minutes pa&s;&s;ed before &s;he could an&s;wer to Vivaldi's few words of tender exclamation: it was long ere &s;he was tranquil enough to ob&s;erve the alte|ration, which &s;evere confinement had given to his ap|pearance. The animated expre&s;&s;ion of his counten|ance was unchanged; yet, when the fir&s;t glow of joy had faded from it, and Ellena had lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve its wanne&s;s, &s;he under&s;tood, too certainly, that he had been a pri&s;oner in the Inqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>During this interview, he related, at Ellena's re|que&s;t, the particulars of his adventures, &s;ince he had been &s;eparated from her in the chapel of San Seba&s;|tain; but, when he came to that part of the narration where it was nece&s;&s;ary to mention Schedoni, he pau&s;ed in unconquerable embarra&s;&s;ment and a di&s;tre&s;s not un|mingled with horror. Vivaldi could &s;carcely endure even to hint to Ellena any part of the unju&s;t conduct, which the confe&s;&s;or had practi&s;ed towards him, yet it was impo&s;&s;ible to conclude his account without ex|pre&s;&s;ing much more than hints; nor could he bear to afflict her with a knowledge of the death of him who he believed to be her parent, however the dreadful cir|cum&s;tances of that event might be concealed. His embarra&s;&s;ment became obvious, and was &s;till increa&s;ed by Ellena's inquiries.</P>
<P>At length, as an introduction to the information it was nece&s;&s;ary to give, and to the fuller explanation he wi&s;hed to receive upon a &s;ubject, which, though it was the one that pre&s;&s;ed mo&s;t anxiou&s;ly upon his mind, he had not yet dared to mention, Vivaldi ventured to de|clare his knowledge of her having di&s;covered her pa|rent to be living. The &s;atisfaction immediately ap|parent upon Ellena's countenance heightened his di&s;|tre&s;s, and his reluctance to proceed; believing, as he did, that the event he had to communicate mu&s;t change her gladne&s;s to grief.</P>
<P>Ellena, however, upon his mention of a topic &s;o intere&s;ting to them both, proceeded to expre&s;s the hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="284" REF="032735_0574_0FF499C49B31F1D0">
&s;he had received from the di&s;covery of a parent, who&s;e virtues had even won her affection long before &s;he under&s;tood her own intere&s;t in them. It was with &s;ome difficulty, that Vivaldi could conceal his &s;urprize at &s;uch an avowal of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; the manners of Schedoni, of whom he believed her to &s;peak, having certainly never been adapted to in&s;pire tenderne&s;s. But his &s;urprize &s;oon changed its objects when Oli|via, who had heard that a &s;tranger was at the grate entered the parlour, and was announced as the mother of Ellena di Ro&s;alba.</P>
<P>Before Vivaldi left the convent, a full explanation, as to family, was given on both &s;ides, when he had the infinite joy of learning, that Ellena was not the daughter of Schedoni; and Olivia had the &s;atisfaction to know that &s;he had no future evil to apprehend from him who had hitherto been her wor&s;t enemy. The manner of his death, however, with all the cir|cum&s;tances of his character, as unfolded by his late trial, Vivaldi was careful to conceal.</P>
<P>When Ellena had withdrawn from the room, Vi|valdi made a full acknowledgment to Olivia of his long attachment to her daughter, and &s;upplicated for her con&s;ent to their marriage. To this application, how|ever, Olivia replied, that, though &s;he had long been no &s;tranger to their mutual affection, or to the &s;everal circum&s;tances which had both proved its durability, and tried their fortitude, &s;he never could con&s;ent that her daughter &s;hould become a member of any family, who&s;e principal was either in&s;en&s;ible of her value, or unwilling to acknowledge it; and that in this in&s;tance it would be nece&s;&s;ary to Vivaldi's &s;ucce&s;s, not only that he, but that his father &s;hould be a &s;uitor; on which condition only, &s;he allowed him to hope for her ac|quie&s;cence.</P>
<P>Such a &s;tipulation &s;carcely chilled the hopes of Vi|valdi, now that Ellena was proved to be the daughter, not of the murderer Schedoni but of a Count di Bru|no
<PB N="285" REF="032735_0575_0FF49A14F4273A10">
no, who had been no le&s;s re&s;pectable in character than in rank; and he had little doubt that his father would con&s;ent to fulfil the promi&s;e he had given to the dying Marche&s;a.</P>
<P>In this belief he was not mi&s;taken. The Marche&s;e, having attended to Vivaldi's account of Ellena's fami|ly, promi&s;ed, that if it &s;hould appear there was no &s;e|cond mi&s;take on the &s;ubject, he would not longer op|po&s;e the wi&s;hes of his &s;on.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e immediately cau&s;ed a private inqui|ry to be made, as to the identity of Olivia the pre&s;ent Counte&s;s di Bruno; and though this was not pur&s;ued without difficulty, the phy&s;ician, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the plan of her e&s;cape from the cruelty of Ferando di Bruno, and who was living, as well as Beatrice, who clearly remembered the &s;i&s;ter of her late mi&s;tre&s;s, at length rendered Olivia's identity unque&s;tionable.&mdash;Now, therefore, that the Marche&s;e's every doubt was removed he paid a vi&s;it to the <HI>Santa della Pieta,</HI> and &s;olicited, in due form, Olivia's con&s;ent to the nuptials of Vivaldi with Ellena; which &s;he granted him with an entire &s;atisfaction. In this interview, the Mar|che&s;e was &s;o fa&s;cinated by the manners of the Coun|te&s;s, and plea&s;ed with the delicacy and &s;weetne&s;s, which appeared in tho&s;e of Ellena, that his con&s;ent was no longer a con&s;trained one, and he willingly relinqui&s;h|ed the views of &s;uperiour rank and fortune, which he had formerly looked to for his &s;on, for tho&s;e of virtue &amp; permanent happine&s;s that were now unfolded to him.</P>
<P>On the twentieth of May, the day on which Ellena completed her eighteenth years, her nuptials with Vi|valdi were &s;olemni&s;ed in the church of the <HI>Santa Ma|ria della Pieta,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of the Marche&s;e and of the Counte&s;s di Bruuo. As Ellena advanced through the church, &s;he recollected, when on a former occa&s;ion &s;he had met Vivaldi at the altar, and, the &s;cenes of San Seba&s;tian ri&s;ing to her memory, the happy cha|racter of tho&s;e, which her pre&s;ent &s;ituation oppo&s;ed to
<PB N="286" REF="032735_0576_0FF499C620C93810">
them, drew tears of tender joy and gratitude to her eyes. Then, irre&s;olute, de&s;olate, &s;urrounded by &s;tran|gers, and en&s;nared by enemies, &s;he had believed &s;he &s;aw Vivaldi for the la&s;t time; now, &s;upported by the pre&s;ence of a beloved parent, and by the willing appro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oation of the per&s;ons, who had hitherto &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed her, they were met to part no more; and, as a recollection of the moment when &s;he had been car|ried from the chapel glanced upon her mind, that mo|ment when &s;he had called upon him for &s;uccour, &s;up|plicated even to hear his voice once more, and when a blank &s;ilence, which, as &s;he believed, was that if death, had &s;ucceeded; as the angui&s;h of that moment was now remembered, Ellena became more than ever &s;en&s;ible of the happine&s;s of the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Olivia, in thus relinqui&s;hing her daughter &s;o &s;oon after &s;he had found her, &s;uffered &s;ome pain, but &s;he was con&s;oled by the fair pro&s;pect of happine&s;s, that opened to Ellena, and cheered by con&s;idering, that, though &s;he relinqui&s;hed, &s;he &s;hould not lo&s;e her, &s;ince the vi|cinity of Vivaldi's re&s;idence to <HI>La Pieta,</HI> would per|mit a frequent intercour&s;e with the convent.</P>
<P>As a te&s;timony of &s;ingular e&s;teem, Paulo was per|mitted to be pre&s;ent at the marriage of his ma&s;ter, when as perched in a high gallery of the church, he looked down upon the ceremony, and witne&s;&s;ed the de|light in Vivaldi's countenance, the &s;atisfaction in that of my "old Lord Marche&s;e," the pen&s;ive happine&s;s in the Counte&s;s di Bruno's, and the tender compla|cency of Ellena's which her veil, partly undrawn, allowed him to ob&s;erve, he could &s;carcely refrain from expre&s;&s;ing the joy he felt, and &s;houting aloud, "<HI>O! giorno felice!

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE fete which, &s;ome time after the nuptials, was given by the Marche&s;e, in celebration of them, was held at a delightful villa, belonging to Vivaldi, a few miles di&s;tant from Naples, upon the border of the gulf, and on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore to that which had been the frequent abode of the Marche&s;e. The beauty of its &s;ituation, and its interior elegance induced Vival|di and Ellena to &s;elect it as their chief re&s;idence. It was, in truth, a &s;cence of fairy-land. The plea&s;ure grounds extended over a valley, which opened to the bay, and the hou&s;e &s;tood at the entrance of this valley, upon a gentle &s;lope that margined the water, and com|manded the whole extent of its luxuriant &s;hores, from the lofty cape of Mi&s;eno to the bold mountains of the &s;outh, which, &s;tretching acro&s;s the di&s;tance, appeared to ri&s;e out of the &s;ea, and divided the gulf of Naples, from that of Salerno.</P>
<P>The marble porticoes and arcades of the villa were &s;hadowed by groves of the beautiful magnolia flow|ering a&s;h, cedrati camellias, and maje&s;tic palms; and the cool and airy hills, opening on two oppo|&s;ite fires to a colonade, admitted beyond the rich foliage all the &s;eas and &s;hores of Naples, from the we&s;t; and to the ca&s;t, views of the valley of the do|main, withdrawing among winding hills, wooded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;um <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, except where cliffs of various coloured granites, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">low, green, and purple, lifted their tall
<PB N="288" REF="032735_0578_0FF499C7A79CABB8">
heads, and threw gay gleams of light amid&s;t the um|brageous land&s;cape.</P>
<P>The &s;tyle of the gardens, where lawns and groves and woods varied the undulating &s;urface, was that of England, and of the pre&s;ent day, rather than of Italy; except "Where a long alley peeping on the main," exhibited &s;uch gigantic loftine&s;s of &s;hade, and gran|deur of per&s;pective, as characterize the Italian ta&s;te.</P>
<P>On this jubilee, every avenue and grove, and pavili|on was richly illuminated. The villa it&s;elf, where each airy hall and arcade was re&s;plendent with lights, and lavi&s;hly decorated with flowers and the mo&s;t beau|tiful &s;hrubs, who&s;e buds &s;eemed to pour all Arabia's pre&s;umes upon the air, this villa re&s;embled a fabric call|ed up by enchantment, rather than a &s;tructure of hu|man art.</P>
<P>The dre&s;&s;es of the higher rank of vi&s;itors were as &s;plendid as the &s;cenery, of which Ellena was, in every re&s;pect, the queen. But this entertainment was not given to per&s;ons of di&s;tinction only, for both Vivaldi and Ellena had wi&s;hed that all the tenants of the do|main &s;hould partake of it, and &s;hare the abundant hap|pine&s;s which them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; &s;o that the grounds, which were exten&s;ive enough to accommodate each rank, were relinqui&s;hed to a general gaiety. Paulo was on this occa&s;ion, a &s;ort of ma&s;ter of the revels; and &s;urrounded by a party of his own particular a&s;&s;oci|ates, danced once more, as he had &s;o often wi&s;hed, up|the moonlight &s;hore of Naples.</P>
<P>As Vivaldi and Ellena were pa&s;&s;ing the &s;pot, which Paulo, had cho&s;en for the &s;cene of his fe&s;tivity, they pau&s;ed to ob&s;erve his &s;trange capers and extravagant ge&s;ticulation, as he mingled in the dance, while every now-and-then, he &s;houted forth, though half breathle&s;s with the heartine&s;s of the exerci&s;e&mdash;"<HI>O! giorno felice! O! giorno felice!</HI>"</P>
<P>On perceiving Vivaldi, and the &s;miles with which he and Ellena regarded him, he quitted his &s;ports, and
<PB N="289" REF="032735_0579_0FF49A1806880710">
advancing, "Ah! my dear ma&s;ter," &s;aid he, "do you remember the night, when we were travelling on the banks of the Celano, before that diabolical acci|dent happened in the chapel of San Seba&s;tian; don't you remember how the&s;e people, who were tripping it away &s;o joyou&s;ly, by moonlight, reminded me of Naples and the many merry dances I had footed on the beach here?"</P>
<P>"I remember it well," replied Vivaldi.</P>
<P>"Ah! Signor <HI>mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> you &s;aid at the time, that you hoped we &s;hould &s;oon be here, and that then I &s;hould fri&s;k it away with as glad a heart as the be&s;t of them. The fir&s;t part of your hope, my dear ma&s;ter, you was out in; for, as it happened, we had to go through purgatory before we could reach paradi&s;e; but the &s;econd part is come at la&s;t; for here I am, &s;ure enough! dancing by moonlight, in my own dear bay of Na|ples, with my own dear ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, in &s;afety, and as happy <HI>almo&s;t</HI> as my&s;elf; and with that old mountain yonder, Ve&s;uvius, which I, for&s;ooth! thought I was never to &s;ee again, &s;pouting up fire, ju&s;t as it u&s;ed to do before we got our&s;elves put into the In|qui&s;ition! O! who could have fore&s;een all this! <HI>O! giorno felice! O! giorno felice!</HI></P>
<P>"I rejoice in your happine&s;s my good Paulo," &s;aid Vivaldi, "almo&s;t as much as in my own; though I do not entirely agree with you as to the comparative proportion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ach."</P>
<P>"Paulo!" &s;aid Ellena, "I am indebted to you be|yond any ability to repay: for, to your intrepid affec|tion your ma&s;ter owes his pre&s;ent &s;afety. I will not attempt to thank you for your attachment to him; my care of your welfare &s;hall prove how well I know it; but I wi&s;h to give to all your friends this acknow|ledgment of your worth, and of my &s;en&s;e of it."</P>
<P>Paulo, bowed, and &s;tammered, and writhed and blu&s;hed, and was unable to reply; till, at length, giv|ing
<PB N="290" REF="032735_0580_0FF499C92EED2B18">
a lofty &s;pring from the ground, the emotion which had nearly &s;tifled him bur&s;t forth in words, and "<HI>O! giorno felice! O! giorno felice!</HI>" flew from his lips with the force of an electric &s;hock. They communi|cated his enthu&s;ia&s;m to the whole company, the words pa&s;&s;ed like lightning from one individual to another, till Vivaldi and Ellena withdrew amid&s;t a choral &s;hout, and all the woods and &s;trands of Naples re-ech|oed with&mdash;"<HI>O! giorno felice! O! giorno felice!</HI>"</P>
<P>"You &s;ee," &s;aid Paulo, when they had departed and he came to him&s;elf again, "you &s;ee how people get through their misfortunes, if they have but a heart to bear up again&s;t them, and do nothing that can lie on their con&s;cience afterwards: and how &s;uddenly one comes to be happy, ju&s;t when one is beginning to think one never is to be happy again! Who would have gue&s;&s;ed that my dear ma&s;ter and I, when we were clapped up in that diabolical place, the Inqui&s;ition, &s;hould ever come out again into this world! Who would have gue&s;&s;ed when we were taken before tho&s;e old devils of Inqui&s;itors, &s;itting there all of a row in a place under ground, hung with black, and nothing but torches all around, and faces grinning at us, that but looked as black as the gentry afore&s;aid; and when I was not &s;o much as &s;uffered to open my mouth, no I they would not let me open my mouth to my ma&s;ter!&mdash;who, I &s;ay, would have gue&s;&s;ed we &s;hould ever be let loo&s;e again! who would have thought we &s;hould ever know what it is to be happy! Yet here we are all abroad once more! All at liberty! And may run, if we will, &s;traight forwards, from one end of the earth to the other, and back again without be|ing &s;topped! May fly in the &s;ea, or &s;wim in the &s;ky, or tumble over head and heels into the moon! For, remember, my good friends, we have no lead in our con&s;ciences to keep us down!"</P>
<P>"You mean &s;wim in the &s;ea, and fly in the &s;ky, I &s;uppo&s;e," ob&s;erved a grave per&s;onage near him, "but
<PB N="291" REF="032735_0581_0FF49A221CEF8C08">
as for tumbling over head and heels into the moon! I don't know what you mean by that!"</P>
<P>"P&s;haw!" replied Paulo, "who can &s;top, at &s;uch a time as this, to think about what he means! I wi&s;h that all tho&s;e, who on this night are not merry enough to &s;peak before they think, may ever after be grave enough to think before they &s;peak! But you, none of you, no! not one of you! I warrant, ever &s;aw the roof of a pri&s;on, when your ma&s;ter happened to be below in the dungeon, nor know what it is to be forced to run away, and leave him, behind to die by him&s;elf. Poor &s;ouls! But no matter for that, you can be tolerably happy, perhaps, notwith&s;tanding; but as for gue&s;&s;ing how happy I am, or knowing any thing about the matter&mdash;O! its quite beyond what you can under&s;tand. <HI>O! giorno felice! O! giorno felice!</HI>" repeated Paulo, as he bounded forward to mingle in the dance, and "<HI>O! giorno felice</HI>" was again &s;houted in chorus by his joyful companions.</P>
