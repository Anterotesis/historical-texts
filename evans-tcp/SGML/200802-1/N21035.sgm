<P>by lingering &s;ickne&s;s, or by &s;udden accident; wheth|er at home among&s;t our friends, or abroad in di&s;t|ant lands, where none but &s;trangers &s;hall hear our dying groans. If the LORD be with us: if "the GOD of Jacob be our help," all will be well; we may &s;afely clo&s;e our eyes on all mortal enjoy|ments, and leave the world in peace.</P>
<P>We are convened this day, my brethren, on a very &s;ingular occa&s;ion. Singular, at lea&s;t, in the pre&s;ent age of the world. The life of MAN is placed at "three &s;core years and ten." But we are met to commemorate the goodne&s;s of GOD to his <HI>aged &s;ervant,</HI> here pre&s;ent, who&s;e life has been protracted to the uncommon period of a HUNDRED YEARS this day. With wonder and with grati|tude, we hail &s;uch an unu&s;ual ANNIVERSARY. "Our FATHERS, where are they?" Gone to the world of immortality. But how few of them had arrived at this advanced age, before they quitted the &s;tage of mortality!</P>
<P>It is the de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, with|out going into a particular con&s;ideration of the connexion in which the words &s;tand with the con|text, to take them as a di&s;tinct &s;entence, contain|ing a very important truth, and to endeavour &s;ome improving reflections from them, &s;uited to this occa&s;ion, and to the circum&s;tances of the <HI>aged</HI> per|&s;on, pre&s;ent; and likewi&s;e to deduce &s;uch remarks, as may, by the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, be of general u&s;e and benefit to all.</P>
<P>There are TWO principal ideas held up to view, in the pa&s;&s;age before us, to which your attention is invited.</P>
<P N="1">I. The fir&s;t is, the <HI>frailty</HI> and <HI>mortality</HI> of man.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="027630_0004_0FD5C58893946F98">II. The &s;econd, that there are certain ca&s;es and circum&s;tances in human life, in which it may ju&s;tly be &s;aid, "<HI>There is but a &s;tep between us and death.</HI>"</P>
<P N="1">1. We are naturally led to contemplate the <HI>frail|ty</HI> and <HI>mortality</HI> of man. The term DEATH, in our text, is full of awful import. <HI>Here</HI> is the end, not of our exi&s;tence: Happy, comparatively hap|py for the wicked, the finally impenitent &s;inner, if it were &s;o! But the end of all worldly joys and woes. <HI>Here</HI> is the entrance on a new, an untried &s;tate of exi&s;tence, which will never end. What a &s;ubject this for &s;erious reflection and improve|ment! A &s;ubject equally intere&s;ting to the parent and the child, to the aged and the youth. Why then &s;hould "the living who know they mu&s;t die, put far away that <HI>evil day?</HI>" A day, which they cannot, by all their efforts, ward off, nor by all their tears of anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s, avoid. An event, which will not be bribed, by all the riches of the world, to a moment's delay. For "who," or by what price, can a man "redeem his broth|er, or give to GOD a ran&s;om," that &s;hall reprieve him from death?</P>
<P>When we take a view of the amazing havoc and de&s;truction which that relentle&s;s enemy <HI>Death</HI> has made in our world, what a di&s;tre&s;sful reflection does it afford! It &s;pares no age, &s;ex or character. The prince on the throne and the beggar in his cottage, are alike &s;ubject to his awful power. The father and the &s;on, the tender mother and the help|le&s;s babe, mu&s;t each feel his fatal &s;haft, and bow to death. Nay, this king of terrors &s;hews no more favour to the virtuous than to the profligate.
<PB N="8" REF="027630_0005_0FD5556C20CF8D28">
The righteous and the wicked, the &s;aint and the &s;inner, mu&s;t equally fall before him, and &s;ubmit to his dreadful &s;ceptre. For "it is appointed to all," all without di&s;tinction, "once to die." Hap|py, my friends, if <HI>but once!</HI> For we are informed in the &s;acred word, of a "<HI>&s;econd</HI> death." A death, far more terrible than that of the body. It means the death of the &s;oul; which term, in the language of &s;cripture, is figuratively u&s;ed to &s;igni|fy its eternal &s;eparation from GOD, and from all happine&s;s; to a &s;tate of endle&s;s darkne&s;s and mi&s;|ery. But ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, the &s;ame divine word does al&s;o inform us, that <HI>this</HI> death may be avoid|ed. For it is written, "Ble&s;&s;ed and holy are they that have part in the fir&s;t re&s;urrection, for on &s;uch the <HI>&s;econd death</HI> hath no power." Who are the&s;e privileged ones? it will be natural to inquire. Who, the&s;e happy &s;ouls, on whom that dreadful calamity &s;hall never fall? The &s;acred word de&s;|cribes them, as the holy "followers of the Lamb." None but the friends and followers of JESUS, who have cho&s;en him with all their hearts, for their Saviour and their King, will be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed with this glorious privilege of eternal exemp|tion from the <HI>&s;econd</HI> death. For them, the Sa|viour hath "aboli&s;hed death," and will enable them to triumph over it as a conquered enemy, in the lively hope of a ble&s;&s;ed immortality. But, from the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> death, there is no e&s;cape. "There is no di&s;charge in that war." This is an enemy which has, ever &s;ince the apo&s;tacy of man, been going on from conquering to conquer; and will finally &s;ubdue the whole of our fallen race.</P>
<P>What a melancholy picture is pre&s;ented to our
<PB N="9" REF="027630_0006_0FD5556D9C4F3140">
minds, if we only take a view of the awful ravage and de&s;olation this enemy is making at the <HI>pre&s;ent day,</HI> among the contending armies in <HI>Europe;</HI> where the horrid "noi&s;e of war and garments rolled in blood" are the con&s;tant theme; the daily objects before their eyes! Oh! how doth humanity &s;hudder at the thought of whole hecatombs of human lives immolated at the &s;hrine of ambition and the accur&s;ed lu&s;t of empire! Or &s;acrificed to glut the vengeance of de&s;potic tyrants, or to ap|pea&s;e the wild, the unhappy ravings of a tempo|rary enthu&s;ia&s;m! In either view it mu&s;t be, to ev|ery feeling mind, a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing reflection! Painful beyond expre&s;&s;ion, that there &s;hould be &s;uch a thoughtle&s;s, &s;uch an impious wa&s;te of human blood, as if it were of no more value, than that of bea&s;ts of &s;laughter! Oh! what a tremendous reckoning mu&s;t the aggre&s;&s;ors, the criminal authors of &s;uch de&s;truction and mi&s;ery, have hereafter! and what an awful account mu&s;t they give up, in the great day of dread deci&s;ion! in that day, when thrones and &s;ceptres &s;hall no longer protect the ty|rant from ju&s;tice, nor lawle&s;s power &s;hield the mur|derer from the vengeance of a righteous GOD!</P>
<P>But while we contemplate with horror, the&s;e &s;cenes of de&s;truction, in fields of battle; we are ready to inquire, is it <HI>there</HI> only, that the enemy death is making de&s;olation? Alas! no. He comes, with re&s;i&s;tle&s;s force, into the peaceful hab|itations of dome&s;tic &s;ecurity and friend&s;hip; and often &s;preads a melancholy gloom over whole families. A tender hu&s;band, an affectionate wife, is &s;natched from the embraces of the &s;orrowful partner. The haple&s;s child is left a &s;olitary
<PB N="10" REF="027630_0007_0FD5556F56C6A0A0">
orphan, bereft of the guide of its youth. And how often does the tender parent mourn the untimely death of his offspring, cut down in the morning of life! But &s;uch is the will of heav|en; who &s;aith, "Be &s;till and know that I am GOD." He hath righteou&s;ly ordained that the reign of death &s;hould be univer&s;al, and all mu&s;t, &s;ooner or later, fall before it. The time when, the place where, or the means by which this event will take place, are exceedingly various; all, par|ticularly ordered by the wi&s;e di&s;po&s;ing providence of GOD, and as wi&s;ely kept a &s;ecret from mortals, re&s;erved in the brea&s;t of infinite wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s. Yet it is an event to which mankind are liable, every moment. Which leads us to the SECOND thing propo&s;ed, viz.</P>
<P>That there are certain circum&s;tances in human life, and in which it may be truly &s;aid, "there is but a <HI>&s;tep</HI> between us death." The inquiry here, naturally is, <HI>when</HI> do the&s;e ca&s;es occur and what are tho&s;e circum&s;tances, and who the per&s;ons, of whom it can be affirmed with truth, that they are within "a &s;tep" of death? In an&s;wer, the following things are ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>FIRST, The a&s;&s;ertion is &s;trictly true, in a &s;en&s;e, of ALL our dying race. They walk every day, by the brink of the grave, by the very gates of the eternal world. It is but a <HI>breath</HI> that &s;eparates us from the invi&s;ible &s;tate. "For what is our life but a <HI>vapour,</HI> that appeareth for a little time and then vani&s;heth away." Surely "man at his be&s;t e&s;tate is altogether vanity." "He giveth up the Gho&s;t, and where is he?"</P>
<P>SECONDLY, The truth in our text, may, with
<PB N="11" REF="027630_0008_0FD5C589F25010E0">
&s;pecial propriety, be applied to that cla&s;s of men, "who go down to the &s;ea in &s;hips, who do bu&s;i|ne&s;s in great waters." Our SEAFARING BRETH|REN are an order of citizens, important indeed to &s;ociety, and who&s;e <HI>calling</HI> is both lawful and ne|ce&s;&s;ary. But every one knows it is al&s;o an haz|ardous one. Do they wi&s;ely reflect on the dan|gers that &s;urround them? Are they &s;en&s;ible on what precarious ground they &s;tand every moment while pur&s;uing their bu&s;ine&s;s on the mighty billows? That "there is but a &s;tep," a <HI>plank,</HI> "between them and death." How important, how &s;erious is the reflection! What a &s;olemn argument to con|vince them of the nece&s;&s;ity of religion, of recon|ciliation to GOD, and of actual readine&s;s for death; that if it &s;hould be &s;udden, it may not come un|expected, nor meet them with &s;urpri&s;e; which leads us to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>THIRDLY, How many SUDDEN ACCIDENTS, in the daily cour&s;e of life, verify the words of our text, and are an awakening proof that "there is but a <HI>&s;tep</HI> between us and death." An <HI>apoplexy,</HI> a <HI>fall,</HI> a <HI>blow,</HI> a <HI>wound,</HI> and &s;ometimes a &s;udden bur&s;t of <HI>violent pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> have, in an in&s;tant &s;napped a&s;under the brittle thread of life, and &s;wiftly hur|ried the &s;oul into the eternal world. Such events are by no means uncommon. How frequently do we read and hear of them? How often too, do mankind experience narrow, even <HI>hairbreadth</HI> e&s;|capes from in&s;tant death? when, to appearance, a miracle alone could have pre&s;erved them. That &s;uch ca&s;es do not more frequently prove fatal, and that our lives are not taken away by innumerable accidents, to which we are daily expo&s;ed, is to be
<PB N="12" REF="027630_0009_0FD55572F37B4E58">
a&s;cribed to nothing but the immediate, con&s;tant interpo&s;ition of GOD, who&s;e powerful and mer|ciful hand upholds us, each moment of life. I doubt not, that while I am now &s;peaking, there are numbers here pre&s;ent, who can te&s;tify, from their own experience, to the truth of the&s;e ob&s;erv|ations, who, this moment, recollect the day, the place, the circum&s;tance, in which they narrowly e&s;caped being in&s;tantly deprived of life, and &s;ent quickly into eternity. But the LORD was mer|ciful, and has &s;pared you yet a little longer. Let it not be, to fill up a greater mea&s;ure of &s;in; but, O! may your gratitude to GOD be as &s;ignal, as was your deliverance!</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, A SICK BED has often witne&s;&s;ed the truth of our text, that "there is but a &s;tep between us and death." Can none of us affirm this al&s;o, from our own experience? Have we not been, by a violent <HI>fever,</HI> by excruciating <HI>pain,</HI> or, by more <HI>&s;low di&s;ca&s;e,</HI> reduced to the very verge of life; our friends weeping around us, hourly expecting to &s;ee us breathe our la&s;t; phy&s;icians are of no avail, the di&s;order baffles their utmo&s;t &s;kill, all hopes of recovery &s;eemed to be gone, and in our own apprehen&s;ion, if we had our &s;en&s;es, all the pro&s;pect was, va&s;t, boundle&s;s, amazing eter|nity! When, all on a &s;udden, by an unexpected and unaccountable turn of the di&s;ea&s;e, we were, as if by the immediate voice of GOD, called back again to life, &s;natched as from the borders of the pit, ran&s;omed from the grave, and at a moment, when it might, with truth be &s;aid, "There was but a <HI>&s;tep</HI> between us and death."</P>
<P>Once more, <HI>fifthly;</HI> with peculiar propriety,
<PB N="13" REF="027630_0010_0FD555746282E660">
may the expre&s;&s;ion in the text be applied to tho&s;e who are far advanced in OLD AGE. We know, indeed, that no age in life is exempt from the &s;troke of death. The youth who is now &s;porting in all the plea&s;ures and gaieties of juvenile years, may be in his grave, before the <HI>man</HI> whom we here be|hold, bowed under the weight of years. It is not unu&s;ual that the faire&s;t blooms are &s;oone&s;t cropt, by the cold hand of relentle&s;s death. But when a per&s;on has arrived at his <HI>three&s;core and ten,</HI> there &s;eems to be a moral certainty of a &s;peedy di&s;&s;olu|tion. His hoary hairs and enfeebled limbs daily admoni&s;h him that it is but "a <HI>&s;tep</HI>" that divides him from the congregation of the dead, from "the hou&s;e appointed for all the living." Every hour tells him, the &s;ands in his gla&s;s are ju&s;t run out, that his "days are numbered, and almo&s;t fini&s;hed." O how proper, how important, that tho&s;e who have arrived at <HI>old age,</HI> &s;hould &s;et loo&s;e from this world and all the enjoyments, cares, frowns and flatteries of it, view them&s;elves as at the door of the grave, live in daily expectation of the &s;ummons that will call them into the world of &s;pirits; and give all diligence that they be found in readine&s;s for their la&s;t remove.</P>
<P>Having briefly &s;ugge&s;ted &s;ome ob&s;ervations from the pa&s;&s;age before us, in a doctrinal way, I poceed to the</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>A variety of u&s;eful remarks might be drawn from this intere&s;ting &s;ubject. I &s;hall confine my|&s;elf, and a&s;k your attention only to a few of them, at this time.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="14" REF="027630_0011_0FD55575DFE2FAA8">1&s;t, It naturally leads us, in the fir&s;t place, to a <HI>humbling</HI> reflection on the weak, mi&s;erable &s;tate of man, in con&s;equence of his guilty apo&s;tacy from GOD. Here is the baneful &s;ource of all our woe. To this fountain, we may trace all tho&s;e bitter &s;treams of &s;orrow, pain, mi&s;ery and death, which &s;pread &s;uch a dark and gloomy &s;hade over this fallen world. From this &s;ource, have proceeded tho&s;e rivers of blood which have deluged the earth; by wars, per&s;ecutions, oppre&s;&s;ions, tyrannies, by anarchy, fanatici&s;m and &s;uper&s;tition; which, at different periods of time, have &s;o much di&s;graced humanity and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the world. From the &s;ame cau&s;e have ari&s;en all tho&s;e bitter animo&s;ities, feuds and di&s;&s;entions which have di&s;turbed the happine&s;s of &s;ocieties, di&s;cord and variance in families, hatred and &s;trife among individuals; in a word, all the unnumbered calamities that have befallen mankind from generation to generation, down to this day. They have all taken their ri&s;e from man's &s;inful de|parture from his GOD. Nor do the evils terminate here. They are not confined to the pre&s;ent life. Tho&s;e endle&s;s mi&s;eries in the future world, which await the wicked, and the finally impenitent &s;in|ner, are but the ju&s;t fruit and "wages of &s;in." But while we contemplate the di&s;mal effects of &s;in, both in this and the coming world, what cau&s;e have we,</P>
<P N="2">2dly, To adore the infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of GOD, that there is a foundation laid in the go&s;|pel for <HI>hope</HI> even in <HI>death.</HI> That the con&s;ideration of the <HI>certainly</HI> of death, does not, nece&s;&s;arily land the mind in the region of <HI>hopele&s;s</HI> de&s;pondency. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, that although we <HI>mu&s;t</HI> die, yet
<PB N="15" REF="027630_0012_0FD5C586EA9D1E60">
we <HI>may</HI> live again, and live a new, a better life, be|yond the grave: a life of glorious immortality and joy; where &s;orrow and death &s;hall reign no more for ever. For the&s;e hopes and this happine&s;s, we are entirely and exclu&s;ively indebted to the go&s;|pel of Chri&s;t. This has brought "life and im|mortality to light." Here we find that "JESUS is the re&s;urrection and the life;" and that he that "believeth in HIM, though he were dead, yet &s;hall he live."</P>
<P>It is, indeed, a &s;olemn thing to exchange worlds, to go from time into eternity. The way through death is a <HI>dark valley,</HI> but JESUS can enlighten this pa&s;&s;age. He has once, him&s;elf, pa&s;&s;ed through it. For he was dead, and behold he is alive, and liv|eth forevermore, Amen; and hath the keys of hell and of death." It is through this <HI>door</HI> of death that he has appointed all his friends &s;hall follow him to glory. He will not therefore, "leave or for&s;ake them," when they &s;hall come to it. He has, by travelling through the dark valley him&s;elf, &s;weetened the pa&s;&s;age for all his children, who come after him. So that many of them have cheerfully ventured into it, leaning upon the promi&s;e of their GOD and Saviour, and from &s;weet experience, have been ready to adopt tho&s;e comfortable lines,
<Q><L>"JESUS can make a dying bed,</L>
<L>Feel &s;oft as downy pillows are,</L>
<L>While on his brea&s;t I lean my head,</L>
<L>And breathe my life out &s;weetly there."</L></Q></P>
<P>Have you never, my brethren, within your own ob&s;ervation, had occa&s;ion to witne&s;s this truth; in the triumphant departure of &s;ome, who, in their <HI>la&s;t hours</HI> have enjoyed un&s;peakable &s;erenity of mind, if not tran&s;ported with the lively hope of
<PB N="16" REF="027630_0013_0FD5557A29ED3720">
glory? Although, <HI>perhaps,</HI> a little before, or during their &s;ickne&s;s, they were in great darkne&s;s and fear, re&s;pecting their &s;tate. They wept, they trembled at the awful pro&s;pect before them. Yet, through the goodne&s;s of a faithful GOD, before they left the world, the clouds di&s;per&s;ed, the everla&s;ting moun|tains appeared; the tear of di&s;tre&s;s was wiped from their eyes, by the gentle hand of their compa&s;|&s;ionate Saviour, and the &s;ting of the dreaded mon|&s;ter, was rendered pointle&s;s and ea&s;y, by the balmy &s;upports of the go&s;pel, and the &s;weet "con&s;ola|tions of CHRIST," in their expiring moments. Are the&s;e the ble&s;&s;ed effects of a hope founded on the <HI>go&s;pel?</HI> O! with what ardour of gratitude &s;hould we join the Apo&s;tle, and &s;ay, "Thanks be to GOD for this un&s;peakable gift."</P>
<P N="3">3dly, The &s;ubject teaches us that death, or mere|ly <HI>dying</HI> is, by no means the principal thing we have to fear in that &s;olemn hour. There is &s;ome|thing infinitely more dreadful than death, which is SIN. It is <HI>this,</HI> and this only, that clothes death with its principal horrors.</P>
<P>There is, indeed, &s;omething terrible and abhor|rent to nature, in the thoughts of dying. Nature &s;hrinks from the di&s;&s;olution, dreads the painful &s;troke which &s;eparates the &s;oul from the body, and all its tender earthly connexions. But the apo&s;tle tells us, "the <HI>&s;ting</HI> of death is SIN." It is <HI>this</HI> that arms it with terror. When <HI>this</HI> is taken away by the pardoning mercy of GOD, through the precious blood of Je&s;us, death is &s;tripped of its gloom, and becomes the friendly me&s;&s;enger, &s;ent by the ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, to call his children home to tho&s;e "man&s;ions in his Father's hou&s;e, which
<PB N="17" REF="027630_0014_0FD523A852121558">
he went, as their forerunner, to prepare for them." They meet him therefore with courage; &s;ome|times with a tran&s;port of joy, &s;aying, "O death where is thy &s;ting! Thanks be to GOD who giv|eth me the victory, through our Lord JESUS CHRIST." Which leads me to remark,</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The &s;ubject points out the <HI>only</HI> &s;afe &s;ound|ation of <HI>hope</HI> in death, viz. JESUS CHRIST. This, this is the "chief corner &s;tone," on which you and I, my hearers, mu&s;t re&s;t our hope, if ever we expect to meet death with comfort and &s;afety. "Other foundation can no man lay." The con|flict will be inexpre&s;&s;ibly terrible, without the pre|&s;ence of Chri&s;t, without the almighty &s;upport of his love and power. Every other foundation will a&s;&s;uredly fail. Where el&s;e would you look for &s;up|port? Shall you place confidence in your having been educated in a chri&s;tian country, and brought up under the light of the go&s;pel? Or will you build your hopes on your good intentions and re|&s;olutions, on your prayers, tears and religious per|formances? Or dare you venture your all for eter|nity, on your having made a profe&s;&s;ion of relig|ion and attended the ordinances of the go&s;pel? In a word, will you tru&s;t to your works of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, or your deeds of charity? The&s;e props are too weak to &s;upport a dying man, or give com|fort to a &s;oul ju&s;t launching into eternity, and about to appear before a holy God. Be a&s;&s;ured, that if you have no better foundation than <HI>the&s;e,</HI> your "expectation will peri&s;h;" the&s;e will all &s;ink from under you, and prove as mere "refuges of lies," which will be &s;wept all away by the be|&s;om of death, and will leave you hopele&s;s, wretch|ed and undone forever.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="027630_0015_0FD5557CA280EA90">But if on the other hand, your hope re&s;ts on this "Rock of ages" JESUS CHRIST alone, if your confidence is built on the ground of that everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s which he has wrought out, that complete atonement he hath made for &s;in; "nei|ther life nor <HI>death</HI> can &s;eparate you from the love" and eternal enjoyment "of God;" nor can "the gates of hell prevail again&s;t you."</P>
<P>THE GREAT CONCERN, therefore, the all im|portant inquiry, my hearers, is, have <HI>we,</HI> or have we not, built our HOPE on <HI>this</HI> foundation? The &s;ubject before us, as well as the occa&s;ion, render &s;uch an examination peculiarly &s;uitable and im|portant, not to one more than to another; but to <HI>all,</HI> of whatever age, cla&s;s, or condition, of life. Are we not all mortal? Do we know the day of our death, or the length of time that infinite wi&s;dom has allotted us for our probation here? Are we certain that the term has not nearly expired? And are we &s;ecure one hour, or moment, from the arre&s;t of death?</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, and ju&s;tly, that the words of our text are truly, applicable to every one; that "There is but a <HI>&s;tep</HI> between us and death." That "our life is but a <HI>vapour,</HI>" and who can tell when, or how &s;uddenly, that vapour &s;hall be driven away? Without doubt, it will be much &s;ooner, with many, than they now expect.</P>
<P>Are any of you, now in the <HI>prime</HI> of life; in the vigour of <HI>youth?</HI> Will <HI>this</HI> prove a &s;ecurity again&s;t the &s;troke of death? Look to yonder, <HI>Gol|gotha,</HI> and &s;ee the graves of many a <HI>lovely youth,</HI> &s;natched from their fond parents in the morning of life; youths, who as little thought of dying as you do this day, until the fatal &s;ummons came.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="027630_0016_0FD5557E1EFA30E8">Are others of you in the <HI>meridian</HI> of life, involv|ed in the cares of a family, and bu&s;ily engaged in worldy &s;chemes and pur&s;uits? And are <HI>you</HI> &s;ure that your &s;un will not &s;et before the evening of old age, or that your pre&s;ent engagements &s;hall not be interrupted by an unexpected call into the eternal world? Are you &s;ure that the awful words pronounced by the prophet to <HI>Hannaniah,</HI> will not be verified in you, "This year thou &s;halt die!" What frequent admonitions have we, by the year|ly, and daily calls of one and another from us by death, to "prepare to meet our GOD," "le&s;t coming &s;uddenly, he find us &s;leeping."</P>
<P>Let the &s;olemn que&s;tion then, be brought home to our bo&s;oms. Am I prepared for that <HI>&s;tep</HI> which will u&s;her my immortal &s;pirit into the im|mediate pre&s;ence of my maker, GOD? Have I, at pre&s;ent, <HI>any</HI> hope at all, on which I make depend|ance? If &s;o, is my hope any thing better than "the &s;pider's web," or the "hope of the hypo|crite, which will peri&s;h when GOD takes away my &s;oul." On what ground am I building for eternity? Is it on the <HI>&s;andy</HI> foundation of mere <HI>morality,</HI> or my own good works? Is it on an empty <HI>profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of godline&s;s? Or upon &s;ome favour|ite <HI>name,</HI> party, denomination or di&s;tinction among men? Is it upon tran&s;ient <HI>affections,</HI> &s;udden <HI>im|pul&s;es,</HI> or <HI>fla&s;hes of joy,</HI> like tho&s;e of the "&s;tony ground hearers?" Are <HI>the&s;e</HI> the foundation on which I am building my eternal hopes? Or, is it up|on that firm, that immoveable ROCK, <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us?</HI> Have I ever deeply felt my peri&s;hing need of this foundation? my utter depravity, guilt and help|le&s;&s;ne&s;s; the righteou&s;ne&s;s of that law that con|demns
<PB N="20" REF="027630_0017_0FD5C58CF70A60B8">
the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of it to eternal puni&s;hment, for every in&s;tance of violation? Gal. iii. 10. Have I been convinced of the entire in&s;ufficiency of all "works of rigteou&s;ne&s;s which I have done," or can do to make the lea&s;t atonement for my &s;ins, or procure my pardon and acceptance with a holy and ju&s;t GOD? And being divinely enlightened, have, I "fled for refuge" to the perfect and glo|rious atonement of CHRIST, as "the only hope &s;et before me?" Have I &s;een the &s;afety, the al|&s;ufficiency of this foundation, &s;o as cordially to tru&s;t in it for my whole &s;alvation; that I can humbly &s;ay, in the language of the prophet, "in the Lord have I righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength?"</P>
<P>And is my hope of that kind, that it "<HI>purifies</HI> me, even as HE is pure?" Am I become, indeed, a "New creature?" Have "old things pa&s;&s;ed away?" If I have experienced a change of <HI>heart,</HI> is it manife&s;ted by a change of <HI>life?</HI> by a &s;tudi|ous care to "deny all ungodline&s;s and every worldly lu&s;t, and to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in the world?" THESE are the &s;criptural marks of a real chri&s;tian. If <HI>the&s;e</HI> are found in us, my brethren, WE are chri&s;tians: And have ju&s;t ground of "rejoicing in the hope of the glory of GOD." And death, how &s;oon or &s;uddenly &s;oever it may come, can do us no harm: we &s;hall fall a&s;leep in Je&s;us.</P>
<P>But if not, in the name of GOD, it is high time to awake and look to our &s;tanding. For it is, in|deed, on "&s;lippery places;" and "there is but a STEP between us and death." And if "our feet &s;hould &s;lide," while in the pre&s;ent condition, un|der an in&s;upportable load of guilt, the weight will
<PB N="21" REF="027630_0018_0FD55582D1A793B8">
inevitably plunge us into a &s;tate of remedile&s;s woe, of endle&s;s ruin. On the other hand, how joyful, how glorious is the pro&s;pect which a good hope in Chri&s;t pre&s;ents to the dying chri&s;tian! Cheer|fully may he look forward to the departing hour, and with &s;weet &s;erenity adopt the &s;acred triumph of the apo&s;tle, "I am more than a conqueror through him that hath loved me."</P>
<P N="5">5thly. But I now clo&s;e the di&s;cour&s;e, by a more particular application of the &s;ubject to that aged, <HI>very aged</HI> per&s;on, on who&s;e account we are convened this day; and at who&s;e reque&s;t I &s;tand here on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>How great, <HI>venerable Father!</HI> how di&s;tingui&s;h|ing is the goodne&s;s of that merciful GOD, who has upheld you through all the vici&s;&s;itudes of a long life, and has lengthened out your days to this remarkable period! What millions of inhabitants have been &s;wept off from the earth, &s;ince you came upon the &s;tage of life! and how few COE|VALS have you in our world! With what wonder and gratitude have you cau&s;e to look back upon the varied &s;cene of life you have pa&s;&s;ed through, and upon the revolutions and changes you have &s;een, &s;ince the days of youth! Changes in the <HI>nat|ural</HI> world; changes, &s;urprizing changes in the <HI>political,</HI> and in the <HI>moral</HI> world. To us, Sir, e&s;|pecially to our ri&s;ing youth, the race of life you have run, appears very long indeed. But not &s;o to you, as you have told me, but a mere <HI>&s;pan.</HI> Upon a retro&s;pective view of it, methinks you are ready to &s;ay, with the aged patriarch, when the curious que&s;tion was put to him by Pharaoh, "How old art thou?" In reply, "<HI>Few</HI> and evil
<PB N="22" REF="027630_0019_0FD55584F9D35C28">
have the days of the years of my life been." You cannot, however, add, as in the next words, that "you have not attained to the years of the life of your <HI>fathers,</HI> in the days of their pilgrimage;" for you have exceeded them <HI>all,</HI> and almo&s;t all upon the pre&s;ent &s;tage of action.</P>
<P>A rare &s;ight! my brethren, our eyes behold, this day! A fellow citizen, who has &s;urvived a <HI>century!</HI> Born when <HI>New-England</HI> was in its childhood; when <HI>America</HI> was, comparatively, a wilderne&s;s; but about SEVENTY YEARS after the landing of our <HI>forefathers</HI> in PLYMOUTH, the place of his birth. May the unu&s;ual &s;ight &s;uita|bly affect our minds, and excite &s;erious and grate|ful reflections on the wonderful power, goodne&s;s, patience and tender mercy of GOD to his creatures!</P>
<P>And while you, AGED FATHER, with good old JACOB, acknowledge, with a grateful heart, "the GOD that hath fed you all your life long," may you not, with peculiar propriety, now, at the clo&s;e of a long life, adopt the words of DAVID in the text, and &s;ay, "There is but a <HI>&s;tep</HI> between me and death!" an important &s;tep indeed. You will naturally, on this occa&s;ion (as far as the en|feebled powers of your mind, which are nece&s;&s;a|rily impaired by age, will permit) be led to con|template the great, the intere&s;ting change that lies ju&s;t before you; and the awful importance of be|ing found in actual readine&s;s for it. You have "heard and learned" from the go&s;pel, what that foundation is, on which alone, you, and we all, can with &s;afety build our hopes, and die in peace. And that "other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Je&s;us Chri&s;t." The all-per|fect
<PB N="23" REF="027630_0020_0FD55587ACA50420">
atonement made, and the everla&s;ting righte|ou&s;ne&s;s brought in by HIM, is that Rock, on which you may, with infinite &s;ecurity and &s;atisfaction depend, when you &s;hall be called to take that <HI>la&s;t &s;tep</HI> which will introduce your unbodied &s;pirit in|to a world of untried and immortal exi&s;tence. On <HI>this</HI> ground, never did one fail, or come &s;hort of heaven. On <HI>this</HI> foundation then, fix, immuta|bly fix your faith and hope. Then, may you, with patience and &s;erenity of &s;oul, "all the days of your appointed time wait, till your change comes," when, with a gentle &s;troke, the me&s;&s;en|ger death &s;hall give you a peaceful di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from earth to "a brighter world on high." And in the mean time, may you, the few intervening days that heaven may allot you, between this and the parting hour, be enabled to adopt the words of "Paul the <HI>aged,</HI>" and &s;ay "I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand, henceforth is laid up for me, a crown of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, which the Lord, the righteous Judge will give me in that day, and not to me only, but to all them al&s;o that love his appearing."</P>
<P>FINALLY, brethren and friends, all, who have met here this day and on this occa&s;ion, the &s;ingu|lar event which has called us together, is adapted to excite very u&s;eful and improving reflections in the minds of both old and young. It is very im|probable we &s;hall ever meet again on a <HI>&s;imilar,</HI> and perhaps never, all of us, on <HI>any</HI> occa&s;ion. This, be it as it may, is of very &s;mall importance, com|pared with one of infinitely greater moment. Nor is it material at what age or period of life, we quit mortality, whether in youth, in manhood, or at
<PB N="24" REF="027630_0021_0FD5C5A38D198FB8">
the age of a <HI>hundred</HI> years. The only important point is, that our peace be made with God, by virtue of a real, a vital union with the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Without <HI>this,</HI> all our hopes are vain, and will end in fearful di&s;appointment, at the hour of death. For it is written, "the &s;inner, though an hundred years old, &s;hall be accur&s;ed." But "precious in the &s;ight of the Lord, is the <HI>death</HI> of his &s;aints," and "mark the perfect man, and be|hold the upright, for the <HI>end</HI> of that man is peace." To the &s;oul united to Je&s;us, death will prove the welcome harbinger of endle&s;s joys.</P>
<P>Be it therefore, our great, our only concern, to &s;ecure this ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. To this end, let us hearken to, and comply with the calls of the go&s;pel, im|prove the fleeting moments of life to the glory of GOD, and in "&s;erving our generation according to his will;" and then, when life &s;hall clo&s;e, we &s;hall be gathered to our <HI>fathers</HI> in peace. Our bodies &s;hall lie down in that man&s;ion of &s;ilent re|po&s;e, "where the wicked cea&s;e from troubling;" and our &s;ouls, through the merits of our divine Redeemer, &s;hall be received to that eternal "Re&s;t that remaineth for the people of GOD."</P>
