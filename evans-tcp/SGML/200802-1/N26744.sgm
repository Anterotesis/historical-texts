<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>ON December 25, 1698, a number of young per&s;ons, actuated by a love for religion, and a de&s;ire to a&s;&s;i&s;t and pro|mote each other's advancement in the offices of piety, agreed upon "a private weekly meeting, for religious exerci&s;e, and the good improvement of the even|ing of the LORD's day."</P>
<P>ABOUT eleven years after, as the members had become numerous, and it was inconvenient to a&s;&s;emble in one place, it was deemed advi&s;able to di|vide; and one branch of the &s;ociety continued to meet in the &s;outh part of the town, and the other in the north.</P>
<P>THE &s;ociety is compo&s;ed of &s;erious and well di&s;po&s;ed youths, who continue members till they form family connec|tions, or leave the town. There is no recollection of a &s;ingle in&s;tance of the expul&s;ion of an individual for ill con|duct,
<PB N="iv" REF="035590_0003_1005F895354FCFD8">
or of any one having de&s;ired to leave the &s;ociety from di&s;like. The utmo&s;t harmony and fraternal affection have prevailed in their meetings: and the in&s;titution has been promotive of the happie&s;t effects in encouraging and a&s;&s;i&s;ting youthful piety and practical godline&s;s.</P>
<P>THAT a &s;ociety con&s;tituted of per&s;ons who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions and principles are apt to be mutable, and ea&s;ily affected and e&s;tranged by the di&s;&s;ipations of ear|ly life, &s;hould have been zealou&s;ly &s;up|ported <HI>through a whole century,</HI> is a cir|cum&s;tance which mu&s;t forcibly excite our admiration. On the termination of this period, the young men of the el|der branch of the &s;ociety reque&s;ted that a di&s;cour&s;e might be delivered to them in public, to commemorate the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of the In&s;titution, and to fur|ther its views. In compliance with this reque&s;t the following was written and delivered, and to gratify the &s;ociety it is now publi&s;hed.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR YOUNG FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO commemorate the e&s;tabli&s;hment of that little fraternity of which you are &s;o hap|py as to be members, is the de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent addre&s;s. Under the patronage of Di|vine Providence, your &s;ociety has been con|tinued during ONE HUNDRED YEARS, with|out intermi&s;&s;ion or neglect. Within this pe|riod, how many in&s;titutions of this kind, in neighbouring towns, and el&s;ewhere, have been formed and di&s;continued! The zeal with which they commenced &s;oon &s;ub&s;ided; and the cold and languid &s;pirit of the world chilled the fervors of their piety and quenched the flame of their devotion! But the fire of love <HI>here</HI> enkindled, like the lamp of the &s;anctuary, has been kept alive and bright; and, as "a light &s;hining in a dark place," has diffu&s;ed its cheering influence, with in|crea&s;ing &s;plendor, <HI>through a whole century.</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="035590_0005_1005F89952217EA8">
What plea&s;ure mu&s;t it afford tho&s;e who im|proved <HI>this</HI> as the &s;chool of their religious di&s;cipline, and by it were trained for that heavenly &s;ociety of which they are now mem|bers&mdash;how mu&s;t it enhance the joys of &s;uch of your pious predece&s;&s;ors as are now in glory,&mdash;if we may &s;uppo&s;e them bending their regards, from the exalted &s;pheres they fill, to the&s;e humbler &s;cenes, to behold the progre&s;s and the multiplied benefits of this a&s;&s;ociation! To find here tho&s;e &s;piritual exer|ci&s;es commenced and cultivated which pre|pare for a participation in their more perfect prai&s;es and joys! And how mu&s;t <HI>you,</HI> my dear young friends, be encouraged and ani|mated in all the duties and engagements of your retirement, by the&s;e con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>TO &s;trengthen your attachment to this &s;oci|ety, and to further its views, I &s;hall now call your attention to a few remarks on that pa&s;|&s;age of &s;cripture which you will find in&s;erted in the vi<HI>th Chapter of the Epi&s;tle to the</HI> HEBREWS, <HI>at the</HI> 11<HI>th and</HI> 12<HI>th ver&s;es.</HI></P>

<P>"WE DESIRE THAT EVERY ONE OF YOU DO SHEW THE SAME DILIGENCE TO THE FULL ASSURANCE OF HOPE UNTO THE END.</P>
<P>"THAT YE BE NOT SLOTHFUL, BUT FOLLOWERS OF THEM WHO THROUGH FAITH AND PATIENCE INHERIT THE PROMISES."</P>
<P>THIS epi&s;tle includes a variety of in|tere&s;ting advice: but its general view and ultimate &s;cope appear to be, &s;o to e&s;tabli&s;h the faith and animate the zeal of the Hebrew converts to chri&s;tianity, that they might con|tinue firm and un&s;haken in the holy profe&s;|&s;ion which they had embraced. They lived in a di&s;&s;olute age. The prejudices of their own nation, and the corruption and infidelity of the world around them, expo&s;ed them to many difficulties and dangers. Tho&s;e who were faithful to GOD and the Redeemer, and &s;teadily adhered to the cau&s;e of truth and duty, had before them only the gloomy pro&s;|pect of public neglect or contempt; the re|linqui&s;hment of per&s;onal ea&s;e and &s;afety, the forfeiture of property, or the lo&s;s of life. To allay their fears, to compo&s;e their minds to fortitude and magnanimity, and to deter them from the &s;hame and guilt of apo&s;tacy, the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t weighty arguments,
<PB N="8" REF="035590_0007_1005F89E6B0707A8">
the mo&s;t powerful and affecting di&s;&s;ua&s;ives, were nece&s;&s;ary. And &s;uch the Apo&s;tle u&s;ed, to confirm them in a re&s;olute adherence to the truth as it was in Je&s;us. To encourage them to "hold fa&s;t the profe&s;&s;ion of their faith without wavering,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 23.</NOTE> and to pre&s;erve them from "an evil heart of unbelief,"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. iii. 12.</NOTE> he re|minds them of the &s;uperior excellency of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, not only to Mo&s;es the founder of the Jewi&s;h economy, but even to the Angels who were employed in its promulgation.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. i.</NOTE> He mentions the higher and more eminent advantages re|&s;ulting from the go&s;pel; that it would pro|duce nobler effects, that it opened brighter pro&s;pects, that it was enriched with much better promi&s;es, and that it had in rever&s;ion an inheritance of heavenly rewards. And, that he might leave no motive untried that could &s;erve to excite their ambition and fire their zeal, he bids them contemplate the conduct and recollect the &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e who had fini&s;hed their cour&s;e with honor, and through faith and patience had gone to inherit the promi&s;es; urging them to be followers of their &s;teps, that they al&s;o
<PB N="9" REF="035590_0008_1005F8A1CBF93368">
might arrive at the &s;ame height of glory and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>JUSTLY are the examples of great and illu&s;trious per&s;ons, who were remarkable for the &s;uperior &s;trength and con&s;tancy of their virtue, held in high veneration, and propo&s;ed as patterns for the re&s;t of mankind to copy after. Such examples both in&s;truct and per|&s;uade; excite admiration, in&s;pire re&s;olution, and prompt to excel. They &s;hew the practi|cability of improvements in virtue, and offer the greate&s;t encouragements to a holy dili|gence in religion, by pre&s;enting us with a view of its happy i&s;&s;ue; they per&s;uade us to tread in the paths in which others have found the way to eternal glory; and they a&s;&s;ure us that if we gladly and eagerly follow them the &s;ame way, we may hope hereafter to meet in the &s;ame happy &s;ociety, and be joint in|heritors of the &s;ame promi&s;es.</P>
<P>CHRISTIANS are now "heirs of the promi&s;es." In <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>patience</HI> they pa&s;s the &s;cene of their trial. Their virtue exer|ci&s;ed and improved, and their warfare fini&s;h|ed, they receive the reward of their faith in the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls, and go to inherit
<PB N="10" REF="035590_0009_1005F88D82848800">
the proffered bli&s;s. Then, their <HI>faith</HI> is changed into &s;ight, and their <HI>patient endur|ance</HI> into joyful triumph. They took the cour&s;e of piety and holine&s;s, in which I tru&s;t we are progre&s;&s;ing. They did well. They got &s;afe to heaven, where all of us profe&s;s a de&s;ire to go. ?Who but would follow? They have and enjoy; while we wait and hope. From their holy walk and conver|&s;ation while they tabernacled in the fle&s;h, be encouraged, my brethren, to take direction how to &s;teer your cour&s;e to reach the man&s;ions they now inhabit; there to be joined with them, not as companions in <HI>tribulation</HI> and <HI>patience,</HI> but in the delights of endle&s;s prai&s;e and joyful love. As it was, and mu&s;t be &s;till their "de&s;ire that every one of you &s;hould &s;hew the &s;ame diligence to the full a&s;&s;urance of hope to the end;" be per&s;uaded not to be "&s;lothful." Be not negligent of your duty, nor indolent in its performance. Do not &s;it down in &s;luggi&s;h ea&s;e, or carele&s;s idlene&s;s; indi&s;po&s;ed to action, or heedle&s;s of your progre&s;s. Lo&s;e not your opportunities. "Be up and doing with all your might what your hands find to do, while it is called to day, for the night of death cometh wherein no one can work." Make it the bu&s;ine&s;s of your

Let nothing retard or hinder your progre&s;s. Suffer noth|ing to interfere with your obtaining the prize promi&s;ed to the active, the faithful, and the per&s;evering. Be animated and quickened in its pur&s;uit by the attractive influence of <HI>their</HI> example and &s;ucce&s;s, who have &s;o run as to obtain.

Should the&s;e trials prove &s;o &s;evere that "even the youths begin to faint and to tire, let them wait upon the Lord and renew their &s;trength;" and by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance they &s;hall "run and not be weary, and walk and not faint."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. xl. 30, 31.</NOTE> While you have <HI>faith</HI> to direct,

<P>WE will only make a tender of &s;ome <HI>orders</HI>; which may be, all or mo&s;t of them well ob|&s;erved in &s;uch a &s;ociety: and then, let any man living, who has the fear of GOD before his eyes, declaim, if he can, again&s;t the de&s;ign of erecting <HI>young mens' meetings,</HI> for the ex|erci&s;es of religion.</P>
<P N="1">I. LET there be two hours in the evening &s;et apart; and let there be two prayers made by the members of the &s;ociety in their turns; between which, let a &s;ermon be repeated; and there may be the &s;inging of a p&s;alm annexed.</P>
<P N="2">II. LET all the members of the &s;ociety re|&s;olve to be charitably watchful over one
<PB N="21" REF="035590_0020_1005F8BBD3D81018">
another; never to divulge one anothers in|firmities; always to inform and advi&s;e one another of every thing that may appear to call for an admonition, and to take it kindly when they are admoni&s;hed.</P>
<P N="3">III. LET all who are to be admitted as members of the &s;ociety, be accompanied by two or three of the re&s;t, unto the mini&s;ter of the place, that they may receive his holy coun&s;els and charges, and that every thing may be done with his approbation; and &s;o let their names be added unto the roll.</P>
<P N="4">IV. IF any per&s;on thus enrolled among them, fall into a &s;candalous iniquity, let the rebukes of the &s;ociety be di&s;pen&s;ed unto him; and let them forbid him, to come any more among them, until they bring &s;uitable expre&s;|&s;ions and evidences of repentance with them.</P>
<P N="5">V. LET the li&s;t be once in a quarter called over; and then, if it be ob&s;erved, that any of the &s;ociety have much ab&s;ented them&s;elves, let there be &s;ome &s;ent unto them to inquire the rea&s;on of the ab&s;ence; and if no rea&s;on be given but &s;uch as intimates an apo&s;ta&s;y from good beginnings, let them upon ob&s;tinacy, after loving and faithful admonitions, be ob|literated.</P>
<P N="6">VI. ONCE in three months, let there be, if need be, a collection, out of which the ne|ce&s;&s;ary charges of the &s;ociety &s;hall be de|frayed,
<PB N="22" REF="035590_0021_1005F8C117F56470">
and the re&s;t employed upon &s;uch pious u&s;es, as may be agreed upon.</P>
<P N="7">VII. ONCE in two months, let the whole evening be devoted unto &s;upplications for the conver&s;ion and &s;alvation of the ri&s;ing genera|tion in the land; and particularly for the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the go&s;pel, in that congregration, whereto the &s;ociety does belong.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. LET the whole &s;ociety, be exceed|ingly careful, that their di&s;cour&s;e while they are together, after the other &s;ervices of relig|ion are over, have nothing in it, that &s;hall have any taint of backbiting, or vanity, or the lea&s;t relation to the affairs of government, or to things which do not concern them, and do not &s;erve the intere&s;ts of holine&s;s in their own conver&s;ation. But let their di&s;cour&s;e be wholly on the matters of religion; and tho&s;e al&s;o, not the di&s;putable and controver&s;al mat|ters, but the points of practical piety. They may propo&s;e que&s;tions upon this intention, and every one in an orderly manner, take his liberty to an&s;wer them.</P>
<P N="9">IX. LET every per&s;on in the &s;ociety, look upon it, as a &s;pecial ta&s;k incumbent on him, to look out for &s;ome other hopeful young man, and u&s;e all proper pains to engage him in the re&s;olutions of godline&s;s, until he al&s;o &s;hall be joined unto the &s;ociety. And when a &s;ociety &s;hall in this way be increa&s;ed unto a
<PB N="23" REF="035590_0022_1005F8C2A51DB968">
fit number, let it &s;warm into more; who may hold an u&s;eful corre&s;pondence with one another.</P>
<P>AS arrows in the hand of a mighty man, &s;o will young men con&s;tellated into &s;uch meet|ings be unto the pa&s;tor that &s;hall bring his vicinity to be filled with them. Happy is the pa&s;tor that has his quiver full of them; they need not be a&s;hamed of what they do; they may &s;ay to their enemies, that which may &s;hame them out of their incon&s;iderate enmity.</P>
<P>AND now, bring forth your &s;trong rea&s;on, if you have any, O ye men of &s;loth, who are wi&s;er than the men that can render a rea&s;on: What rea&s;on can be brought, again&s;t &s;uch &s;ocieties? Truly, as it was of old argued, that it was a &s;ign chri&s;tianity was a good thing, becau&s;e that &s;uch a man as Nero hated it; &s;o, the character of tho&s;e men, who de|ride and explode the&s;e <HI>private meetings,</HI> is for the mo&s;t part &s;uch, that even this would rather afford an argument unto &s;erious chri&s;tians, that it mu&s;t be a good thing to uphold them, and a thing di&s;agreeable to the &s;pirit that rules in this world. In fine:</P>
<P>THE man who &s;hall be the in&s;trument of &s;etting up &s;uch a &s;ociety in a place, cannot comprehend, unto what a long train of good con&s;equences, he is become in&s;trumental.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="035590_0023_1005F8C44E3E6C60">AND they that &s;hall in &s;uch a &s;ociety, to|gether carry on the duties of chri&s;tianity, and the prai&s;es of a glorious CHRIST, will have upon them&s;elves a ble&s;&s;ed &s;ympton, that they &s;hall be together a&s;&s;ociated in the heavenly city, and in the prai&s;es and glories, that &s;hall never have an end."</P>
<P>EXTRACT from a book entitled, "a help to national reformation," giving an account of the religious &s;tate of New England; printed in 1705.</P>
<P>"OUR religious &s;ocieties increa&s;e and pro&s;|per. They meet at proper times to pray to|gether, and repeat &s;ermons, and forward one another in the fear of GOD. They are helpful in doing abundance of good for the advancement of religion in the neighbourhood, and to make the mini&s;try much more profita|ble in the weekly exerci&s;e of it."</P>
<P>AFTER &s;peaking of the <HI>&s;ocieties of heads of families,</HI> and tho&s;e for <HI>reformation,</HI> the author ob&s;erves that "the young men in Bo&s;ton and its vicinity have formed them&s;elves in a&s;&s;o|ciations for religious exerci&s;es, &s;igning &s;ome good rules to be ob&s;erved by them there|in, much like the orders of the &s;ocieties of young men in London."<NOTE PLACE="foot">[AN account of the &s;ocieties of young men in England, with rules and directions for their u&s;e, may be found in Baxter's Prac|tical Works, Vol. IV.]</NOTE></P>
