<HEAD>AN ENQUIRY INTO THE EFFECTS OF PUBLIC PUNISHMENTS UPON CRIMINALS, AND UPON SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<P>THE de&s;ign of puni&s;hment is &s;aid to be,&mdash;1&s;t, to reform the per&s;on who &s;uffers it,&mdash;2dly, to prevent the perpetration of crimes, by exciting terror in the minds of &s;pectators; and,&mdash;3dly, to remove tho&s;e per&s;ons from &s;ociety, who have manife&s;ted, by their tempers and crimes, that they are unfit to live in it.</P>
<P>FROM the fir&s;t in&s;titution of governments, in every age and country (with only a few exceptions) legi&s;lators have thought that puni&s;hments &s;hould be <HI>public,</HI> in order to produce the two fir&s;t of the&s;e intentions. It will require &s;ome fortitude to combat opinions that have been &s;ancti|fied by &s;uch long and general prejudice, and &s;upported by univer&s;al practice. But truth in government, as well as in philo&s;ophy, is of pro|gre&s;&s;ive growth. As in philo&s;ophy, we often arrive at truth by reject|ing the evidence of our &s;en&s;es; &s;o in government, we often arrive at it after divorcing our fir&s;t thoughts. Rea&s;on, tho' depo&s;ed and op|pre&s;&s;ed, is the only ju&s;t &s;overeign of the human mind. Di&s;coveries, it is true, have been made by accident; but they have derived their credit and u&s;efulne&s;s only from their according with the deci&s;ions of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>IN medicine, above every other branch of philo&s;ophy, we perceive many in&s;tances of the want of relation between the apparent cau&s;e and effect. Who, by rea&s;oning a priori, would &s;uppo&s;e, that the hot regi|men was not preferable to the cold, in the treatment of the &s;mall-pox? But experience teaches us, that this is not the ca&s;e. Cau&s;e and effect appear to be related in philo&s;ophy, like the objects of chymi&s;try. Si|milar

bodies often repel each other, while bodies that are di&s;&s;imilar in figure, weight and quality, often unite together with impetuo&s;ity. With our pre&s;ent imperfect degrees of knowledge of the properties of bodies, we can di&s;cover the&s;e chymical relations only by experiment. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the connection between <HI>cau&s;e</HI> and <HI>effect,</HI> in many parts of government. This connection often accords with rea&s;on, while it is repugnant to our &s;en&s;es&mdash;and when this is not the ca&s;e, from our inability to perceive it, it forces our con&s;ent from the te&s;timony of experience and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>IT has been remarked, that the profe&s;&s;ion of arms owes its pre&s;ent rank, as a &s;cience, to its having been re&s;cued, &s;ince the revival of letters, from the hands of mere &s;oldiers, and cultivated by men acquainted with other branches of literature. The rea&s;on of this is plain. Truth is an unit. It is the &s;ame thing in war&mdash;philo&s;ophy&mdash;medicine&mdash;morals&mdash;religion and government; and in proportion as we arrive at it in one &s;cience, we &s;hall di&s;cover it in others.</P>
<P>AFTER this apology, for di&s;&s;enting from the e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions and practice, upon the &s;ubject of public puni&s;hments, I &s;hall take the li|berty of declaring, that the great ends propo&s;ed, are not to be obtained by them; and that, on the contrary, all <HI>public</HI> puni&s;hments tend to make bad men wor&s;e, and to encrea&s;e crimes, by their influence upon &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE reformation of a criminal can never be effected by a public pu|ni&s;hment, for the following rea&s;ons:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, AS it is always connected with infamy, it de&s;troys in him the &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, which is one of the &s;tronge&s;t out-po&s;ts of virtue.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, IT is generally of &s;uch &s;hort duration, as to produce none of tho&s;e changes in body or mind, which are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to re|form ob&s;tinate habits of vice.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, EXPERIENCE proves, that public puni&s;hments have encrea&s;ed propen&s;ities to crimes. A man who has lo&s;t his character at a whip|ping-po&s;t, has nothing valuable left to lo&s;e in &s;ociety. Pain has begot|ten in&s;en&s;ibility to the whip; and &s;hame to infamy. Added to his old habits of vice, he probably feels a &s;pirit of revenge again&s;t the whole community, who&s;e laws have inflicted his puni&s;hment upon him; and hence he is &s;timulated, to add to the number and enormity of his out|rages upon &s;ociety. The long duration of the puni&s;hment, when pub|lic, by encrea&s;ing its infamy, &s;erves only to encrea&s;e the evils that have been mentioned. The criminals, who were &s;entenced to work in the
<PB N="5" REF="020689_0004_0FB09E3545030CF0">
pre&s;ence of the city of London, upon the Thames, during the late war, were prepared, by it, for the perpetration of every crime, as &s;oon as they were &s;et at liberty from their confinement. I proceed,</P>
<P N="2">II. To &s;hew, that public puni&s;hments, &s;o far from preventing crimes by the terror they excite in the minds of &s;pectators, are directly calculated to produce them.</P>
<P>ALL men, when they &s;uffer, di&s;cover either fortitude, in&s;en&s;ibili|ty, or di&s;tre&s;s. Let us enquire into the effects of each of the&s;e upon the minds of &s;pectators.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, FORTITUDE is a virtue, that &s;eizes &s;o forcibly upon our e&s;teem, that wherever we &s;ee it, it never fails to weaken, or to obliterate, our dete&s;tation of the crimes with which it is connected in criminals. "I call upon you (&s;aid major Andr&egrave;, at the place of his execution, to his attendants) to bear witne&s;s, gentlemen, that I die like a brave man." The effect of this &s;peech upon the Ame|rican army is well known. The &s;py was lo&s;t in the hero; and in|dignation, every where, gave way to admiration and prai&s;e. But this is not all&mdash;the admiration which fortitude, under &s;uffering, excites, has in &s;ome in&s;tances excited envy. In Denmark, uncommon pains are taken to prepare criminals for death, by the conver&s;ation and in|&s;tructions of the clergy. After this they are conducted to the place of execution, with uncommon pomp and &s;olemnity. The criminals, un|der the&s;e circum&s;tances, &s;uffer death with meekne&s;s&mdash;piety&mdash;and &s;ome|times with dignity. The effects of this, I have been well informed, have been, in &s;everal in&s;tances, to induce deluded people to feign or confe&s;s crimes, which they had never committed, on purpo&s;e to &s;ecure to them&s;elves a con&s;picuous death and a certain entrance into future happine&s;s. There is &s;omething, in the pre&s;ence of a number of &s;pecta|tors, which is calculated to excite and &s;trengthen fortitude in a &s;ufferer. "It is not &s;o difficult a thing (&s;aid Lewis the XIV. to his courtiers, who &s;tood around his death-bed) to die, as I expected." No wonder, &s;ays Voltaire, who relates this anecdote "for all men die with forti|tude, who die in company." The bravery of &s;oldiers is derived, in a great degree, from the operation of this principle in the human mind.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, IF criminals di&s;cover <HI>in&s;en&s;ibility</HI> under their puni&s;hments, the effect of it mu&s;t be &s;till more fatal upon &s;ociety. It removes, in&s;tead of exciting terror. In &s;ome in&s;tances, I conceive it may excite a de&s;ire in the minds of per&s;ons whom debt or &s;ecret guilt have made mi&s;erable, to &s;eek an end of their di&s;tre&s;&s;es in the &s;ame enviable apathy to evil.&mdash;
<PB N="6" REF="020689_0005_0FB09E366DFEA880">
Should this in&s;en&s;ibility be connected with cheerfulne&s;s (which is &s;ome|times the ca&s;e) it mu&s;t produce &s;till more unfriendly effects upon &s;ociety. But terrible mu&s;t be the con&s;equences of this in&s;en&s;ibility and cheerful|ne&s;s, if they &s;hould lead criminals to retaliate upon the inhuman curio|&s;ity of &s;pectators, by profane or indecent in&s;ults or conver&s;ation.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, THE effects of <HI>di&s;tre&s;s</HI> in criminals, though le&s;s obvious, are not le&s;s injurious to &s;ociety, than fortitude or in&s;en&s;ibility. By an immu|table law of our nature, di&s;tre&s;s of all kinds, when <HI>&s;een,</HI> produces &s;ym|pathy, and a di&s;po&s;ition to relieve it. This &s;ympathy in generous minds, is not le&s;&s;ened by the di&s;tre&s;s being the offspring of crimes; on the con|trary, even the crimes them&s;elves are often palliated by the reflection, that they were the unfortunate con&s;equences of extreme poverty&mdash;of &s;educing company&mdash;or of the want of a virtuous education, from the lo&s;s or negligence of parents in early life. Now, as the di&s;tre&s;s which the criminals &s;uffer, is the effect of a law of the &s;tate, which cannot be re&s;i&s;ted, the &s;ympathy of the &s;pectator is rendered abortive, and re|turns empty to the bo&s;om in which it was awakened. Let us briefly examine the con&s;equences of this abortive &s;ympathy in &s;ociety. It will not be nece&s;&s;ary here to dwell upon all the advantages of this principle in human nature. It will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that it is the vice|gerent of the divine benevolence in our world. It is intended to bind up all the wounds which &s;in and death have made among mankind. It has founded ho&s;pitals&mdash;erected charity-&s;chools, and connected the ex|tremes of happine&s;s and mi&s;ery together, in every part of the globe.&mdash; Above all, &s;en&s;ibility is the &s;entinel of the moral faculty. It decides upon the quality of actions before they reach that divine principle of the &s;oul. It is of it&s;elf, to u&s;e the words of an elegant female poet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mi&s;s <HI>MOORE.</HI></NOTE>,
<Q>"A ha&s;ty moral&mdash;a &s;udden &s;en&s;e of right."</Q></P>
<P>IF &s;uch are the advantages of &s;en&s;ibility, now what mu&s;t be the con&s;e|quences to &s;ociety, of extirpating or weakening it in the human brea&s;t? But public puni&s;hments are calculated to produce this effect. To prove this, I mu&s;t borrow an analogy from the animal oeconomy.&mdash;The &s;en&s;i|bility of the human body is &s;aid to be <HI>active</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;ive.</HI> The fir&s;t is connected with motion and &s;en&s;ation: the &s;econd only with &s;en&s;ation. The fir&s;t is encrea&s;ed, the &s;econd is dimini&s;hed, by the repetition of im|pre&s;&s;ions. The &s;ame phaenomena take place in the human mind. Sen|&s;ibility here is both <HI>active</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;ive.</HI> Pa&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;ibility is le&s;&s;ened, while that which is active is encrea&s;ed by habit. The pa&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;ibility of a phy&s;ician, to the di&s;tre&s;s of his patients, is always dimini&s;hed, but
<PB N="7" REF="020689_0006_0FB09E38026AD1F8">
his active &s;en&s;ibility is always encrea&s;ed by time; hence we find young phy&s;icians <HI>feel</HI> mo&s;t&mdash;but old phy&s;icians, with le&s;s feeling, <HI>di&s;cover mo&s;t</HI> &s;ympathy with their patients.</P>
<P>IF &s;uch be the con&s;titution of our minds, then the effects of di&s;tre&s;s upon them will be, not only to de&s;troy pa&s;&s;ive, but, to eradicate active &s;en&s;ibility from them. The principle of &s;ympathy, after being often oppo&s;ed by the law of the &s;tate, which forbids it to relieve the di&s;tre&s;s it commi&s;erates, will cea&s;e to act altogether; and, from this defect of action, and the habit ari&s;ing from it, will &s;oon lo&s;e its place in the human brea&s;t. Mi&s;ery of every kind will then be contemplated without emo|tion or &s;ympathy.&mdash;The widow and the orphan&mdash;the naked&mdash;the &s;ick, and the pri&s;oner, will have no avenue to our &s;ervices or our charity&mdash; and what is wor&s;e than all, when the &s;entinel of our moral faculty is re|moved, there is nothing to guard the mind from the inroads of every po|&s;itive vice.</P>
<P>I PASS over the influence of this &s;ympathy in its fir&s;t operation upon the government of the &s;tate. While we pity, we &s;ecretly condemn the law which inflicts the puni&s;hment&mdash;hence ari&s;es a want of re&s;pect for laws in general, and a more feeble union of the great ties of government.</P>
<P>I HAVE only to add, upon this part of my &s;ubject, that the perni|cious effects of &s;ympathy, where it does not terminate in action, are happily provided again&s;t by the Jewi&s;h law. Hence we read of a pro|hibition again&s;t it, where per&s;ons &s;uffer for certain crimes. To &s;pecta|tors, the voice of Heaven, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, is, "thine eye &s;hall not pity him."</P>
<P N="4">4thly, BUT it is po&s;&s;ible the characters or conduct of criminals may be &s;uch, as to excite indignation or contempt, in&s;tead of pity, in the minds of &s;pectators. Let us therefore enquire, briefly, into the effects of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions upon the human mind. Every body acknowledges our obligations to <HI>univer&s;al</HI> benevolence. But the&s;e cannot be fulfilled, unle&s;s we love the whole human race, however diver&s;ified they may be by weakne&s;s or crimes. The indignation or contempt which is felt for this unhappy part of the great family of mankind, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily extingui&s;h a large portion of this univer&s;al love. Nor is this all&mdash;the men, or perhaps the women, who&s;e per&s;ons we dete&s;t, po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ouls and bodies compo&s;ed of the &s;ame materials as tho&s;e of our friends and relations. They are bone of their bone, and were originally fa&s;hion|ed with the &s;ame &s;pirits. What then mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of a familiarity with &s;uch objects of horror, upon our attachments and duties to our friends and connections, or to the re&s;t of mankind? If
<PB N="8" REF="020689_0007_0FB09E3963B65968">
a &s;pectator &s;hould give him&s;elf time to reflect upon &s;uch a &s;ight of hu|man depravity, he would naturally recoil from the embraces of friend|&s;hip, and the endearments of dome&s;tic life, and perhaps &s;ay, with an unfortunate great man, after having experienced an in&s;tance of trea|chery in a friend, "Oh! that I were dog, that I might not call man my brother."&mdash;The Jewi&s;h law forbad more than nine and thirty la&s;hes, left the &s;ufferer &s;hould afterwards become "vile" in the &s;ight of &s;pec|tators. It is the prerogative of GOD alone, to contemplate the vices of bad men, without withdrawing from them the &s;upport of his benevo|lence. Hence we find, when he appeared in the world in the per&s;on of his &s;on, he did not exclude criminals from the benefits of his goodne&s;s. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed a woman caught in the perpetration of a crime, which was capital by the Jewi&s;h law, with a friendly admonition; and he opened the gates of paradi&s;e to a dying thief.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, BUT let us &s;uppo&s;e, that criminals are viewed without &s;ympa|thy&mdash;indignation&mdash;or contempt. This will be the ca&s;e either when &s;pectators are them&s;elves hardened with vice, or when they are too young, or too ignorant, to connect the ideas of crimes and puni&s;hments toge|ther. Here then a new &s;ource of injury to &s;ociety ari&s;es from the pub|lic nature of puni&s;hments. Every portion of them will appear, to &s;pec|tators of this de&s;cription, to be mere arbitrary acts of cruelty. Hence will ari&s;e a di&s;po&s;ition to exerci&s;e the &s;ame arbitrary cruelty over the feelings and lives of their fellow-creatures. To &s;ee blows, or a halter, impo&s;ed in cold blood, upon a criminal, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ive behaviour, opera|ting with the ignorance of the &s;pectators, indicates innocence more than vice, cannot fail of removing the natural ob&s;tacles to violence and mur|der in the human mind.</P>
<P N="6">6thly, PUBLIC puni&s;hments make many crimes known to per&s;ons, who would otherwi&s;e have pa&s;&s;ed through life in a total ignorance of them. They moreover produce &s;uch a familiarity in the minds of &s;pectators, with the crimes for which they are inflicted, that, in &s;ome in&s;tances, they have been known to excite a propen&s;ity to them. It has been remarked, that a certain immorality has always kept pace with public admonitions in the churches in the ea&s;tern &s;tates. In pro|portion as this branch of eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline has declined, fewer children have been born out of wedlock.</P>
<P N="7">7thly, IGNOMINY is univer&s;ally acknowledged to be a wor&s;e pu|ni&s;hment than death. Let it not be &s;uppo&s;ed, from this circum&s;tance, that it operates more than the fear of death in preventing crimes. On the contrary, like the indi&s;criminate puni&s;hment of death, it not only
<PB N="9" REF="020689_0008_0FB09E3AE0BA5B60">
confounds and levels all crimes, but by <HI>encrea&s;ing</HI> the di&s;proportion be|tween crimes and puni&s;hments, it creates a hatred of all law and go|vernment, and thus di&s;po&s;es to the perpetration of every crime. Laws can only be re&s;pected, and obeyed, while they bear an exact proportion to crimes. The law which puni&s;hes the &s;hooting of a &s;wan with death in England, has produced a thou&s;and murders. Not is this all the mi&s;|chievous influence which the puni&s;hment of ignominy has upon &s;ociety. While murder is puni&s;hed with death, the man who robs on the high way, or breaks open a hou&s;e, mu&s;t want the common feelings and prin|ciples which belong to human nature, if he does not add murder to theft, in order to &s;creen him&s;elf, if he &s;hould be detected, from that puni&s;hment which is acknowledged to be more terrible than death.</P>
<P>IT would &s;eem &s;trange, that ignominy &s;hould ever have been adopt|ed, as a milder puni&s;hment than death, did we not know, that the human mind &s;eldom arrives at truth upon any &s;ubject, till it has fir&s;t reached the extremity of error.</P>
<P N="8">8thly, BUT may not the benefit derived to &s;ociety by employing cri|minals to repair public roads, or to clean &s;treets, overbalance the evils that have been mentioned? I an&s;wer, by no means. On the contrary, be|&s;ides operating in <HI>one,</HI> or in <HI>all</HI> the ways that have been de&s;cribed, the practice of employing criminals in public labour, will render labour of every kind di&s;reputable, more e&s;pecially that &s;pecies of it which has for its objects the convenience or improvement of the &s;tate. It is a well known fact, that white men &s;oon decline labour in the We&s;t-Indies, and in the &s;outhern &s;tates, only becau&s;e the agriculture, and mechanical em|ployments of tho&s;e countries, are carried on chiefly by Negro &s;laves. But I object further to the employment of criminals on the high-ways and &s;treets, from the idlene&s;s they will create by alluring &s;pec|tators from their bu&s;ine&s;s; and thereby depriving the &s;tate of greater benefits from the indu&s;try of its citizens, that it can ever derive from the public labour of criminals.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of public puni&s;hments, in every age and country, is full of facts, which &s;upport every principle that has been advanced.&mdash; What has been the operation of the &s;eventy thou&s;and executions, that have taken place in Great-Britain from the year 1688, to the pre&s;ent day, upon the morals and manners of the inhabitants of that i&s;land? Has not every pri&s;on door that has been opened, to conduct crimi|nals to public &s;hame and puni&s;hment, unlocked, at the &s;ame time, the bars of moral obligation upon the minds of ten times the number of people? How often do we find pockets picked under a gallows, and highway-robberies committed within &s;ight of a gibbet? From whence
<PB N="10" REF="020689_0009_0FB09E3F247A2E38">
aro&s;e the con&s;piracies, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations and poi&s;onings, which prevailed in the decline of the Roman empire? Were they not favoured by the public executions of the amphitheatre? It is therefore to the combined operation of indolence, prejudice, ignorance&mdash;and the defect of cul|ture of the human heart, alone, that we are to a&s;cribe the conti|nuance of public puni&s;hments, after &s;uch long and multiplied experi|ence of their inefficacy to reform bad men, or to prevent the com|mi&s;&s;ion of crimes.</P>
<P N="3">III. LET it not be &s;uppo&s;ed, from any thing that has been &s;aid, that I wi&s;h to aboli&s;h puni&s;hments. Far from it&mdash;I wi&s;h only to change the <HI>place</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> of inflicting them, &s;o as to render them effectual for the reformation of criminals, and beneficial to &s;ociety. Before I propo&s;e a plan for this purpo&s;e, I beg leave to deliver the following general axioms.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, THE human mind is di&s;po&s;ed to exaggerate every thing that is removed at a di&s;tance from it, by <HI>time or place.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly, IT is equally di&s;po&s;ed to enquire after, and to magnify &s;uch things as are <HI>&s;ecret.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly, IT always a&s;cribes the extremes in qualities, to things that are <HI>unknown;</HI> and an exce&s;s in duration, to <HI>indefinite</HI> time.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, CERTAIN, and <HI>definite evil,</HI> by being long contemplated, cea&s;es to be dreaded or avoided. A &s;oldier &s;oon lo&s;es, from habit, the fear of death from a bullet, but retains, in common, with other peo|ple, the terror of death from &s;ickne&s;s or drowning.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, AN attachment to kindred and &s;ociety is one of the &s;tronge&s;t feelings in the human heart. A &s;eparation from them, therefore, has ever been con&s;idered as one of the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hments that can be in|flicted upon man.</P>
<P N="6">6thly, PERSONAL liberty is &s;o dear to all men, that the lo&s;s of it, for an indefinite time, is a puni&s;hment &s;o &s;evere, that death has often been preferred to it.</P>
<P>THESE axioms being admitted (for they cannot be controverted) I &s;hall proceed next to apply them, by &s;ugge&s;ting a plan, for the puni&s;h|ment of crimes, which I flatter my&s;elf will an&s;wer all the ends that have been propo&s;ed by them.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, LET a large hou&s;e, of a con&s;truction agreeable to its de&s;ign, be erected in a remote part of the &s;tate. Let the avenue to this hou&s;e be rendered difficult and gloomy by mountains or mora&s;&s;es. Let its
<PB N="11" REF="020689_0010_0FB09E41D45ECC48">
doors be of iron; and let the grating, occa&s;ioned by opening and &s;hut|ting them, be encrea&s;ed by an echo from a neighbouring mountain, that &s;hall extend and continue a &s;ound that &s;hall deeply pierce the &s;oul. Let a guard con&s;tantly attend at a gate that &s;hall lead to this place of puni&s;hment, to prevent &s;trangers from entering it. Let all the officers of the hou&s;e be &s;trictly forbidden ever to di&s;cover any &s;igns of mirth, or even levity, in the pre&s;ence of the criminals. To encrea&s;e the horror of this abode of di&s;cipline and mi&s;ery, let it be called by &s;ome name that &s;hall import its de&s;ign.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, LET the various kinds of puni&s;hment, that are to be inflicted on crimes, be defined and fixed by law. But let no notice be taken, in the law, of the puni&s;hment that awaits any particular crime. By the&s;e means we &s;hall prevent the mind from accu&s;toming it&s;elf to the view of the&s;e puni&s;hments, &s;o as to de&s;troy their terror by habit. The indifference and levity with which &s;ome men &s;uffer the puni&s;hment of hanging, is often occa&s;ioned by an in&s;en&s;ibility that is contracted by the frequent anticipation of it, or by the appearance of the gallows &s;ugge&s;ting the remembrance of &s;cenes of criminal fe&s;tivity, in which it was the &s;ubject of humour or ridicule. Be&s;ides, puni&s;hments &s;hould always be varied in degree, according to the temper of criminals, or the progre&s;s of their reformation.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, LET the duration of puni&s;hments, for all crimes, be limit|ed, but let this limitation be unknown. I conceive this &s;ecret to be of the utmo&s;t importance in reforming criminals, and preventing crimes. The imagination, when agitated with uncertainty, will &s;el|dom fail of connecting the longe&s;t duration of puni&s;hment, with the &s;malle&s;t crime.</P>
<P>I CANNOT conceive any thing more calculated to diffu&s;e terror thro' a community, and thereby to prevent crimes, than the combi|nation of the three circum&s;tances that have been mentioned in puni&s;h|ments. Children will pre&s;s upon the evening fire in li&s;tning to the tales that will be &s;pread from this abode of mi&s;ery. Super&s;tition will add to its horrors, and romance will find in it ample materials for fiction, which cannot fail of encrea&s;ing the terror of its puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>LET it not be objected, that the terror produced by the hi&s;tory of the&s;e &s;ecret puni&s;hments, will operate like the abortive &s;ympathy I have de|&s;cribed. <HI>Active</HI> &s;ympathy can be fully excited only through the avenues of the eyes and the ears. Be&s;ides, the recollection that the only de&s;ign of puni&s;hment is the reformation of the criminal, will &s;u&s;pend the ac|tion
<PB N="12" REF="020689_0011_0FB09E432F6BC928">
of &s;ympathy altogether. We li&s;ten with palene&s;s to the hi&s;tory of a tedious and painful operation in &s;urgery, without a wi&s;h to arre&s;t the hand of the operator. Our &s;ympathy, which in this ca&s;e is of the <HI>pa&s;|&s;ive</HI> kind, is mixed with plea&s;ure, when we are a&s;&s;ured, that there is a certainty of the operation being the means of &s;aving the life of the &s;uf|ferer.</P>
<P>NOR let the expence of erecting and &s;upporting a hou&s;e of repen|tance, for the purpo&s;es that have been mentioned, deter us from the un|dertaking. It would be ea&s;y to demon&s;trate, that it will not co&s;t one-fourth as much as the maintenance of the numerous jails that are now nece&s;&s;ary in every well-regulated &s;tate. But why &s;hould receptacles be provided and &s;upported at an immen&s;e expence, in every country, for the relief of per&s;ons afflicted with bodily di&s;orders, and an objection be made to providing a place for the cure of the di&s;ea&s;es of the mind?</P>
<P>THE nature&mdash;degrees&mdash;and duration of the puni&s;hments, &s;hould all be determined beyond a certain degree, by a court properly con&s;tituted for that purpo&s;e, and who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it &s;hould be to vi&s;it the receptacle for criminals once or twice a year.</P>
<P>I AM aware of the prejudices of freemen, again&s;t entru&s;ting power to a di&s;cretionary court. But let it be remembered, that no power is committed to this court, but what is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the different courts of ju&s;tice in all free countries; nor &s;o much as is now wi&s;ely and nece&s;&s;a|rily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the &s;upreme and inferior courts, in the execution of the penal laws of Penn&s;ylvania. I &s;hall &s;pend no time in defending the con&s;i&s;tency of private puni&s;hments, with a &s;afe and free government. Truth, upon this &s;ubject, cannot be divided. If public puni&s;hments are injurious to criminals and to &s;ociety, it follows, that crimes &s;hould be puni&s;hed in private, or not puni&s;hed at all. There is no alternative. The oppo&s;ition to private puni&s;hments, therefore, is founded altogether in prejudice, or in ignorance of the true principles of liberty.</P>
<P>THE &s;afety and advantages of private puni&s;hments, will appear further, when I add, that the be&s;t governed families and &s;chools are tho&s;e, in which the faults of &s;ervants and children are rebuked private|ly, and where confinement and &s;olitude are preferred for correction, to the u&s;e of the rod.</P>
<P>IN order to render the&s;e puni&s;hments effectual, they &s;hould be ac|commodated to the con&s;titutions and tempers of the criminals, and the peculiar nature of their crimes. Peculiar attention &s;hould be paid, like|wi&s;e,
<PB N="13" REF="020689_0012_0FB09E44C6EC9928">
in the nature, degrees and duration of puni&s;hments, to crimes, as they ari&s;e from pa&s;&s;ion, habit or temptation.</P>
<P>THE puni&s;hments &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of BODILY PAIN, LABOUR, WATCHFULNESS, SOLITUDE, and SILENCE. They &s;hould all be joined with CLEANLINESS and a SIMPLE DIET. To a&s;certain the nature, degrees and duration of the bodily pain, will require &s;ome knowledge of the principles of &s;en&s;ation, and of the &s;ympathies which occur in the nervous &s;y&s;tem. The labour &s;hould be &s;o regulated and directed, as to be profitable to the &s;tate. Be&s;ides employing criminals in laborious and u&s;eful manufactures, they may be compelled to derive all their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from a farm and a garden, cultivated by their own hands, adjoining the place of their confinement.</P>
<P>THESE puni&s;hments may be u&s;ed &s;eparately, or more or le&s;s com|bined, according to the nature of the crimes, or according to the vari|ations of the con&s;titution and temper of the criminal. In the applica|tion of them, the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible advantages &s;hould be taken of the laws of the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, of habit, and of imitation.</P>
<P>TO render the&s;e phy&s;ical remedies more effectual, they &s;hould be accompanied by regular in&s;truction in the principles, and obligations of religion, by per&s;ons appointed for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THUS far I am &s;upported, in the application of the remedies I have mentioned, for the cure of crimes, by the facts that are contained in Mr. Howard's hi&s;tory of pri&s;ons, and by other ob&s;ervations. It re|mains yet to pre&s;cribe the <HI>&s;pecific</HI> puni&s;hment that is proper for each <HI>&s;pecific</HI> crime. Here my &s;ubject begins to oppre&s;s me. I have no more doubt of every crime having its cure in moral and phy&s;ical influence, than I have of the efficacy of the Peruvian bark in curing the intermit|ting fever. The only difficulty is, to find out the proper remedy or remedies for particular vices. Mr. Dufriche de Valaz&eacute;, in his elabo|rate treati&s;e upon penal laws, has performed the office of a pioneer up|on this difficult &s;ubject. He has divided crimes into cla&s;&s;es, and has affixed puni&s;hments to each of them, in a number of ingenious tables. Some of the connections he has e&s;tabli&s;hed between crimes and puni&s;h|ments, appear to be ju&s;t.&mdash;But many of his puni&s;hments are contrary to the fir&s;t principles of action in man; and all of them are, in my opinion, improper, as far as he orders them to be infflicted in the <HI>eye</HI> of the <HI>public.</HI> His attempt, however, is laudable, and de&s;erves the prai&s;e of every friend to mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="020689_0013_0FB09E46AD889208">IF the invention of a machine for facilitating labour, has been repaid with the gratitude of a country, how much more will that man de&s;erve, that &s;hall invent the mo&s;t &s;peedy and effectual methods of re&s;toring the vicious part of mankind to virtue and happine&s;s, and of extirpating a portion of vice from the world?&mdash;Happy condition of human affairs! when humanity, philo&s;ophy and chri&s;tianity, &s;hall unite their influ|ence to teach men, that they are bretheren; and to prevent their preying any longer upon each other! Happy citizens of the United States, who&s;e governments permit them to adopt every di&s;covery in the moral or intellectual world, that leads to the&s;e benevolent pur|po&s;es!</P>
<P>LET it not be objected, that it will be impo&s;&s;ible for men, who have expiated their offences by the mode of puni&s;hment that has been propo|&s;ed, to recover their former connections with &s;ociety. This objection ari&s;es from an unfortunate a&s;&s;ociation of ideas. The infamy of crimi|nals, is derived, not &s;o much from the remembrance of their crimes, as from the recollection of the ignominy of their puni&s;hments. Crimes pro|duce a &s;tain, which may be wa&s;hed out by reformation, and which fre|quently wears away by time: But public puni&s;hments leave &s;cars, which disfigure the whole character; and hence per&s;ons, who have &s;uffer|ed them, are ever afterwards viewed with horror or aver&s;ion. If crimes were expiated by private di&s;cipline, and &s;ucceeded by reformation, cri|minals would probably &s;uffer no more in character from them, than men &s;uffer in their reputation or u&s;efulne&s;s from the puni&s;hments they have undergone when boys at &s;chool.</P>
<P>I AM &s;o perfectly &s;atisfied of the truth of this opinion, that methinks I already hear the inhabitants of our villages and town|&s;hips counting the years that &s;hall complete the reformation of one of their citizens. I behold them running to meet him on the day of his deliverance.&mdash;His friends and family bathe his cheeks with tears of joy; and the univer&s;al &s;hout of the neighbourhood is, "This our bro|ther was lo&s;t and is found&mdash;was dead, and is alive."&mdash;</P>
<P>IT has long been a de&s;ideratum in government, that there &s;hould exi&s;t in it no pardoning power, &s;ince the <HI>certainty</HI> of puni&s;hment ope|rates &s;o much more than its &s;everity, or infamy, in preventing crimes. But where puni&s;hments are exce&s;&s;ive in degree, or infamous from being public, a pardoning power is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. Remove their &s;e|verity and public infamy, and a pardoning power cea&s;es to be nece&s;&s;a|ry in a code of criminal juri&s;prudence.&mdash;Nay, further&mdash;it is &s;uch a defect in penal laws, as in &s;ome mea&s;ure defeats every invention to
<PB N="15" REF="020689_0014_0FB09E487AB64218">
prevent crimes, or to cure habits of vice. If puni&s;hments were mo|derate, ju&s;t and private, they would exalt the feelings of public ju&s;tice and benevolence &s;o far above the emotions of humanity in witne&s;&s;es, juries and judges, that they would forget to conceal, or to palliate crimes; and the <HI>certainty</HI> of puni&s;hment, by extingui&s;hing all hope of pardon in the criminal, would lead him to connect the beginning of his repen|tance with the la&s;t words of his &s;entence of condemnation. To ob|tain this great and &s;alutary end, there &s;hould exi&s;t <HI>certain</HI> portions of puni&s;hment, both in duration and degree, which &s;hould be placed by law beyond the power of the di&s;cretionary court before mentioned, to &s;horten or mitigate.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;aid nothing upon the manner of inflicting death as a puni&s;h|ment for crimes, becau&s;e I con&s;ider it as an improper puni&s;hment for <HI>any</HI> crime. Even murder it&s;elf is propagated by the puni&s;hment of death for murder. Of this we have a remarkable proof in Italy. The Duke of Tu&s;cany, &s;oon after the publication of the Marquis of Beccaria's excellent treati&s;e upon this &s;ubject, aboli&s;hed death as a puni&s;hment for murder. A gentleman, who re&s;ided five years at Pi&s;a, informed me, that only five murders had been perpetrated in his dominions in twenty years. The &s;ame gentleman added, that after his re&s;idence in Tu&s;cany, he &s;pent three months in Rome, where death is &s;till the pu|ni&s;hment of murder, and where executions, according to Doctor Moore, are conducted with peculiar circum&s;tances of public parade. During this &s;hort period, there were &s;ixty murders committed in the precincts of that city. It is remarkable, the manners, principles, and religion, of the inhabitants of Tu&s;cany and Rome, are exactly the &s;ame. The abolition of death alone, as a puni&s;hment for murder, produced this difference in the moral character of the two nations.</P>
<P>I SUSPECT the attachment to death, as a puni&s;hment for murder, in minds otherwi&s;e enlightened, upon the &s;ubject of capital puni&s;h|ments, ari&s;es from a fal&s;e interpretation of a pa&s;&s;age contained in the old te&s;tament, and that is, "he that &s;heds the blood of man, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed." This has been &s;uppo&s;ed to imply, that blood could only be expiated by blood. But I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe, with a late commentator<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Reverend Mr. <HI>WILLIAM TURNER,</HI> in the &s;econd Vol. of the Memoirs of the Literary and Philo&s;ophical Society of Manche&s;ter.</NOTE> upon this text of &s;cripture, that it is rather a <HI>prediction,</HI> than a <HI>law.</HI> The language of it is &s;imply, that &s;uch will be the depravity and folly of man, that murder, in every age, &s;hall
<PB N="16" REF="020689_0015_0FB09E49F137F9C0">
beget murder. Laws, therefore, which inflict death for murder, are, in my opinion, as unchri&s;tian as tho&s;e which ju&s;tify or tolerate re|venge; for the obligations of chri&s;tianity upon individuals, to promote repentance, to forgive injuries, and to di&s;charge the duties of univer|&s;al benevolence, are equally binding upon &s;tates.</P>
<P>THE power over human life, is the &s;olitary prerogative of HIM who gave it. Human laws, therefore, ri&s;e in rebellion again&s;t this pre|rogative, when they transfer it to human hands.</P>
<P>IF &s;ociety can be &s;ecured from violence, by confining the murderer, &s;o as to prevent a repetition of his crime, the end of extirpation will be an&s;wered. In confinement, he may be reformed&mdash;and if this &s;hould prove impracticable, he may be re&s;trained for a term of years, that will probably be coeval with his life.</P>
<P>THERE was a time, when the puni&s;hment of captives with death or &s;ervitude, and the indi&s;criminate de&s;truction of peaceable hu&s;bandmen, women and children, were thought to be e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ucce&s;s of war, and the &s;afety of &s;tates. But experience has taught us, that this is not the ca&s;e. And in proportion as humanity has triumphed over the&s;e maxims of fal&s;e policy, wars have been le&s;s frequent and terrible, and nations have enjoyed longer intervals of internal tranquility. The vir|tues are all parts of a circle. Whatever is humane, is wi&s;e&mdash;whatever is wi&s;e, is ju&s;t&mdash;and whatever is wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and humane, will be found to be the true intere&s;t of &s;tates, whether criminals or foreign enemies are the objects of their legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>I HAVE taken no notice of perpetual bani&s;hment, as a legal puni&s;h|ment, as I con&s;ider it the next in degree, in folly and cruelty, to the puni&s;hment of death. If the receptacle for criminals, which has been propo&s;ed, is erected in a <HI>remote</HI> part of the &s;tate, it will act with the &s;ame force upon the feelings of the human heart, as perpetual ba|ni&s;hment. Exile, when perpetual, by de&s;troying one of the mo&s;t pow|erful principles of action in man, viz. the love of kindred, and country, deprives us of all the advantages, which might be derived from it, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of reformation. While certain pa&s;&s;ions are weakened, this noble pa&s;&s;ion is &s;trengthened by age; hence, by pre&s;erving this pa&s;|&s;ion alive, we furni&s;h a principle, which, in time, may become an over|match for tho&s;e vicious habits, which &s;eparated criminals from their friends, and from &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="020689_0016_0FB09E4E31A0F0D8">NOTWITHSTANDING this te&s;timony again&s;t the puni&s;hment of death and perpetual bani&s;hment, I cannot help adding, that there is more mercy to the criminal, and le&s;s injury done to &s;ociety, by both of them, than by <HI>public</HI> infamy and pain, without them.</P>
<P>THE great art of &s;urgery has been &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in &s;aving, not in de&s;troying, or amputating, the di&s;ea&s;ed parts of the human body. Let governments learn to imitate, in this re&s;pect, the &s;kill and humanity of the healing art. Nature knows no wa&s;te in any of her operations. Even putrefaction it&s;elf, is the parent of u&s;eful productions to man. Human ingenuity, imitates nature in a variety of arts. Offal matters, of all kinds, are daily converted into the means of encrea&s;ing the profits of indu&s;try, and the plea&s;ures of human life. The &s;oul of man alone, with all its moral and intellectual powers, when mi&s;led by pa&s;&s;ion, is abandoned, by the ignorance or cruelty of man, to unpro|fitable corruption, or extirpation.</P>
<P>IF the foregoing rea&s;onings and facts, have been urged in vain, in favour of private puni&s;hments, I &s;hall add one more argument, which I hope will be irre&s;i&s;tible. The puni&s;hments of wicked men, in the world of &s;pirits, are invi&s;ible; we have no knowledge of their reality, nature, degrees, or duration, but what was revealed to us near eighteen hundred years ago; and yet governments owe their &s;tability, chiefly, to that morality, which the terror of the&s;e invi&s;ible, remote, and indefi|nite puni&s;hments, excites in the human mind.</P>
<P>A WORTHY prelate of the church of England once &s;aid upon &s;eeing a criminal led to execution, "There goes my wicked &s;elf." Con&s;i|dering the vices to which the frailty of human nature expo&s;es whole families of every rank and cla&s;s in life, it becomes us whenever we &s;ee a fellow-creature led to public infamy and pain, to add further, "There goes my unhappy father, my unhappy brother, or my unhappy &s;on," and afterward to a&s;k our&s;elves, whether <HI>private</HI> puni&s;hments are not to be preferred to <HI>public.</HI></P>
<P>FOR the honour of humanity it can be &s;aid, that in every age and country, there have been found per&s;ons in whom uncorrupted nature has triumphed over cu&s;tom, and law. El&s;e, why do we hear of hou&s;es being abandoned near to places of public execution? Why do we &s;ee doors and windows &s;hut on the days or hours of criminal exhibiti|ons and proce&s;&s;ions? Why do we hear of aid being &s;ecretly afforded to criminals, to mitigate or elude the &s;everity of their puni&s;hments?&mdash;
<PB N="18" REF="020689_0017_0FB09E511BCC97A8">
Why is the public executioner of the law an object of &s;uch general dete&s;|tation? The&s;e things are the latent &s;truggles of rea&s;on, or rather the &s;ecret voice of God him&s;elf, &s;peaking in the human heart, again&s;t the folly and cruelty of public puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this enquiry by ob&s;erving, that the &s;ame fal&s;e reli|gion and philo&s;ophy, which once kindled the fire on the altar of per&s;e|cution, now doom the criminal to public ignominy and death. In pro|portion as the principles of philo&s;ophy and chri&s;tianity are under&s;tood, they will agree in extingui&s;hing the one, and de&s;troying the other. If the&s;e principles continue to extend their influence upon government, as they have done for &s;ome years pa&s;t, I cannot help entertaining a hope, that the time is not very di&s;tant, when the gallows, the pillory, the &s;tocks, the whipping-po&s;t, and the wheel-barrow (the u&s;ual engines of public puni&s;hments) will be connected with the hi&s;tory of the rack, and the &s;take, as marks of the barbarity of ages and countries, and as melancholy proofs of the feeble operation of rea&s;on, and religion, upon the human mind.</P>
