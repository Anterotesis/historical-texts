<P>THE Publishers of the <HI>Fir&s;t American Edition</HI> of Ambro&s;e and Eleanor, feel a plea&s;ure in pre&s;enting to their Country, a work replete with originality and entertain|ment; which, from the correctne&s;s of the &s;tyle, the cha&s;tne&s;s of the ideas, and its con|taining an intere&s;ting account of the life of Two Children, who&s;e fortitude in adver&s;ity, and moderation in pro&s;perity, peculiarly ad|apts it for academies, &s;chools, and private families, where it may &s;erve the double pur|po&s;e of entertaining the elder, and in&s;tructing the younger branches.&mdash;Its al&s;o having been written by the author of a Vi&s;it of a Week, lately publi&s;hed in Philadelphia, we think, will be an additional recommendation to tho&s;e who have read that plea&s;ing and u&s;e|ful performance.</P>

<P>A Clear &s;ky, and pro&s;perous gales, announced a happy voyage to the ve&s;&s;el in which Co|lonel Carlton had embarked for England: it was returning from Jamaica, leaving on the left the I&s;le of Cuba, and on the right the &s;uperb fore&s;ts of the ancient Bayti.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;o called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></NOTE> The pilot &s;teered toward the Bermuda I&s;les; and the Colonel in a few weeks hoped to embrace a wife and child, endeared to him by an ab&s;ence of twelve months; but the&s;e delightful pro&s;pects &s;oon vani&s;hed; the rolling of the ve&s;&s;el encrea&s;ed, a tremendous water-&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">out approached, and threatened in&s;tant de&s;truction. This being, by the advice of the pilot, broken by a di&s;charge of cannon, all that remained to be done was to lower the &s;ails, &s;hut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">,
<PB N="6" REF="035098_0004_1000B5AEA256A258">
and abandon the ve&s;&s;el to the mercy of the waves. The Heavens were &s;oon filled with fla&s;hes of light|ning; thick darkne&s;s &s;ucceeded day; the thunder rolled, and the ve&s;&s;el, the &s;port of all the various revolutions of the boi&s;terous waves, pre&s;ented only to the unfortunate pa&s;&s;engers &s;hipwreck or death; this &s;oon followed, for the point of a rock forcing an entrance into the ve&s;&s;el, in a few minutes, precipitated it into the bo&s;om of the va&s;t ocean. In this moment of danger, the Colonel, ever calm and collected, &s;eized a plank, upon which he committed him&s;elf to the waves: his example was followed by a few others, and by his faithful dome&s;tic Peter.</P>
<P>Having long floated at random, and contended with the fury of the waves, the Colonel found him&s;elf near land; but &s;uch was the violence of the &s;ea, that at the moment his hopes were &s;trong|e&s;t, he was frequently carried by an overwhelming wave to the greate&s;t di&s;tance: at length, after va|rious e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">orts, he gained a coa&s;t covered with rocks, over which he with difficulty climbed to an exten|&s;ive plain, where he &s;unk down, wholly deprived of &s;en&s;ation. In this &s;tate he remained nearly two hours, when his &s;en&s;es by degrees returning,
<PB N="7" REF="035098_0005_1000B5B16CDBB038">
he di&s;covered two children, half-naked, on their knees, at his &s;ide, who, by their innocent ge&s;tures, expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t lively intere&s;t in his &s;ituation. One of them perceiving that he breathed, exclaim|ed, in a jargon he could ju&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h to be Eng|li&s;h, "He is not dead, &s;i&s;ter; he is come to take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s home&mdash;are you not father?"</P>
<P>His fir&s;t que&s;tions were, "Where am I? What country do you inhabit?" But finding that he was not clearly under&s;tood, he looked round for &s;ome per&s;on to whom he might addre&s;s him&s;elf. Not &s;eeing any one, he attempted to ri&s;e; but ex|hau&s;ted with fatigue, &s;unk down, uttering invo|luntary &s;ighs and groans, forced from him by the weakne&s;s of his condition.</P>
<P>"He is hungry, brother," &s;aid one of the chil|dren, "I will go and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">etch him &s;ome food;" and immediately &s;he fled acro&s;s the plain.</P>
<P>"Who do you belong to?" &s;aid the Colonel, recovering him&s;elf, "have you no friends? no father, no mother?"</P>
<P>"Are not you our father?" a&s;ked the boy.</P>
<P>"I! my child," &s;aid the Colonel, "I do not know you."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="035098_0006_1000A3171881BE20">
"Will you not then love us?" &s;aid the child.</P>
<P>"Yes; but are you alone?"</P>
<P>"O yes," returned he, "we are all alone; nobody but Eleanor and Ambro&s;e; we &s;ee only the great bea&s;ts, and they frighten us very much."</P>
<P>"And who brought you into this country, Am|bro&s;e?" &s;aid the Colonel.</P>
<P>"A great hou&s;e," replied the child, "that went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">on the water."</P>
<P>"And have you never &s;een one like it touch here?"</P>
<P>"O never," &s;aid the child; "there are only great men, all black, that come &s;ometimes in little boats. When we &s;ee them we hide our&s;elves for &s;ear they &s;hould eat us."</P>
<P>"Well!" &s;aid the Colonel with a &s;igh, "I am then lo&s;t without re&s;ource! I mu&s;t end my days here, far from my wife, my friends, my country."</P>
<P>"You will &s;tay with us, will you not?" &s;aid the boy.</P>
<P>"Alas, my child! I have no choice."</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="035098_0007_1000B5B397A3AA90">
"Oh," returned he, "we will love and care&s;s you, as we u&s;ed to do Derley."</P>
<P>"Derley! who was he?"</P>
<P>"Our good friend," an&s;wered the child; "but he is dead; we have wept a great deal for him." As he &s;aid this, his &s;i&s;ter returned with &s;ome tor|toi&s;e and colibri eggs; &s;he brought al&s;o &s;ome dates and a large &s;hell filled with a liquor, which to the ta&s;te &s;eemed that which flows from the palm tree. This &s;imple repa&s;t proved very &s;alutary to the Colonel; his &s;trength returned, he thanked his little ho&s;ts for their &s;olicitude, and reflecting a-new upon his adventure was a&s;toni&s;hed to con|ceive it po&s;&s;ible that two children, &s;o young and &s;o delicate, &s;hould provide for all their wants at an age when others &s;carcely know how to walk or think: he wi&s;hed to di&s;cover by what means it had been effected, but they expre&s;&s;ed their ideas very imperfectly; he could only gue&s;s at their little jargon, and judge from it that they were Engli&s;h. He re&s;olved, neverthele&s;s, while he awaited the return of day, to interrogate them, that he might, from their an&s;wers, form &s;ome conjectures upon their condition, and the cau&s;e of
<PB N="10" REF="035098_0008_1000A31A59639688">
their being de&s;erted at &s;o early an age. "How old are you?" &s;aid he. "We do not under&s;tand you," replied Ambro&s;e; but when he repeated, "I a&s;k how many times you have &s;een the cold and hot &s;ea&s;ons?" Eleanor &s;aid, "We cannot tell; but &s;ince the time our good friend died, we have at every &s;un made a mark with a &s;tone on that great tree you &s;ee there. The Colonel ad|mited the ingenious expedient the children had employed, and going toward the tree, by the light of the moon added all the marks, and counted 1528, which made four years two months and eight days &s;ince they had lo&s;t Derley. "But," &s;aid he, "did he die as &s;oon as you came here?"</P>
<P>"O yes," replied the children, "his blood &s;lowed like the &s;pring at which we drink."</P>
<P>"He was wounded then?" &s;aid the Colonel.</P>
<P>"Very much," they replied.</P>
<P>"But," &s;aid the Colonel, "who brought you hither in the wooden hou&s;e?"</P>
<P>"Mama, with a great many men; one of them was a very bad man; he beat Derley, and gave him a great many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uts with a knife, and
<PB N="11" REF="035098_0009_1000B5B52364E9C0">
then put him with us into a little boat that brought us here."</P>
<P>"And do you," &s;aid the Colonel, "recollect where you lived before you went into this &s;hip? (for the wooden hou&s;e you &s;peak of is called a &s;hip.)"</P>
<P>"Yes, in great hou&s;es, where there were many fine things; then we u&s;ed to &s;ee our dear father &s;ometimes, and he u&s;ed to ki&s;s and love us."</P>
<P>"And was your father in the &s;hip?" &s;aid the Colonel.</P>
<P>"No; before we went into it, he and mama <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> very much; and then we &s;aw him no more."</P>
<P>"In what place," &s;aid the Colonel, "was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">eat hou&s;e in which you lived?"</P>
<P>"In a place where there were a great many others," replied Ambro&s;e. "Do you remember, &s;i&s;ter, that a woman u&s;ed to carry us often into a fine garden, where there was a great river, and roads of trees, where fine women and men u&s;ed to walk, while we played upon the gra&s;s with little girls and boys?"</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="035098_0010_1000B5B7E7C1A878">
"Yes," &s;aid Eleanor, "I remember it very well."</P>
<P>From the&s;e an&s;wers the Colonel could draw little information; all that he conjectured was that his little ho&s;ts were the victims of &s;ome &s;ort of treachery, and that Derley was their friend; and he thought it po&s;&s;ible that the fine garden of which they &s;poke might be St. James's Park; but all this was not &s;ufficiently clear; he hoped that time, by &s;trengthening their rea&s;on, would afford him a more &s;atisfactory explanation.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had the morning &s;un inflamed the horizon, than he aro&s;e, and taking the young pu|pils of Nature, who were henceforth to be his own, by the hand, &s;et out to take a view of the land which Providence had de&s;tined, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, to be his abode. He di&s;covered that it was an i&s;land, &s;urrounded by &s;teep rocks, and ac|ce&s;&s;ible only on one &s;ide to ve&s;&s;els; it was not very exten&s;ive, but was covered with mountains, woods, little hills, and cool and fragrant valleys; here an embowering &s;ore&s;t invited the traveller to ta&s;te in its religious inclo&s;ure the &s;weets of &s;olitude: there a mountain &s;lowly ri&s;ing, covered with fern, di&s;covered from its top an exten&s;ive ocean, &s;trewed
<PB N="13" REF="035098_0011_1000A3222A6516A0">
with an infinity of little i&s;lands, which appeared only like the points of &s;o many rocks. Farther on a &s;pring of water e&s;caped trembling from the hollow of a cave, and ran meandering over beds of reeds to water a &s;miling plain, enamelled with all the various beauties of vegetation. A thou&s;and &s;ucculent vegetables and blooming flowers, a thou|&s;and fruits and odoriferous trees, contended for the &s;hade and land; the cocoa, the ca&s;ia, the palm and the banana tree, the leaves of which were, according to the Indians, the ve&s;tments of our fir&s;t parents; the fig, the white cotton tree, in a word, all the mo&s;t curious and u&s;eful productions of America. No traces of men were, however, vi|&s;ible, but tho&s;e of different animals, &s;uch as otters, flags, goats, and the anta, a &s;mall animal which re&s;embles the elephant, though much &s;mal|ler, and is common to Peru. Among the birds was the &s;ou, a little inoffen&s;ive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">owl, which has the habit of clinging to the ma&s;ts of ve&s;&s;els; the Edolio, &s;o called from its repeating, without cea&s;|ing, in a low melancholy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">one, '<HI>edolio;</HI> and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, a bird of an exqui&s;ite flavour.</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Ambro&s;e, having led the Colo|nel over the i&s;land, "do you find all this &s;o fright|ful?

Eleanor and I &s;leep when it is no longer light, and when the &s;un &s;hines, we run into the woods to &s;eek food. We throw &s;tones at the high trees, and the fruits fall, and we eat them."</P>
<P>"But you had not always &s;trength to do &s;o," &s;aid the Colonel.</P>
<P>"No," replied Eleanor, "it is only &s;ince the dry weather that Ambro&s;e thought of it. O me! before we were not tall enough, and we only eat the fruits that the trees let fall, or &s;ome eggs that the great fi&s;h brought to the &s;ide of the water: but we are near our cabin; come, in father, you &s;hall &s;ee it; take care you do not hurt your head." It was' a kind of &s;ubterraneous cave, at which the arrived through a deep valley, overgrown with palm-trees. The Colonel readily entered; but was in&s;tantly alarmed by a faeted &s;mell, that nearly &s;tifled him: he advanced to di&s;cover the cau&s;e; but what was his horror and a&s;toni&s;hment, when, at the further part of the cave, he &s;aw a disfigured corp&s;e! it was partly dry, and partly putrified and was covered with different aromatic leaves "Do not be freightened," &s;aid Eleanor, ob&s;erv|ing the impre&s;&s;ion it made upon the Colonel, "it is he!"</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="035098_0013_1000B5BB1B223E48">
"He! my child, who!" "Poor Derley," &s;he replied, "who fell dead in this corner."&mdash;"And have you, my children," &s;aid the Colonel, "inhabited a cavern where&mdash;" "Oh, we never left it," interrupted Eleanor, "that we might be always with him." "Yes," &s;aid Ambro&s;e, "we look at him every &s;un, and cover him with fre&s;h leaves." "Good creatures!" exclaimed the Co|lonel; "but, my little friends, he can no longer hear you." "Oh! we know very well," &s;aid Ambro&s;e, "that he cannot hear us; for if he could, he would &s;peak to us, but we would not part with him for all that." "But, my dear chil|dren," &s;aid the Colonel, "you expo&s;e your&s;elves to the danger of becoming &s;ick, and dying like|wi&s;e."</P>
<P>"Ah," &s;aid Ambro&s;e, having remained thought|ful a moment, "once as we were looking at Der|ley, Eleanor's face turned quite white, and &s;he fell upon the ground. I thought &s;he was going to die; for I called, and &s;he did not an&s;wer me; Eleanor I &s;aid, my dear Eleanor, will you leave Ambro&s;e all alone? but &s;he did not &s;peak. Then I turned to the Sun, and begged he would give me back Eleanor, or burn me with his fire. He heard me, for &s;he got up and walked."</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="035098_0014_1000B5BD996ACA48">
"Not the Sun, my child," &s;aid the Colonel, but God heard you."</P>
<P>"God! who is God?" "That Great Being, my child," &s;aid the Colonel, "who has placed you upon the earth; who watches over you, who has miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erved your life: but I &s;hall ex|plain this hereafter, at pre&s;ent we mu&s;t think of tak|ing hence this inanimate corp&s;e."</P>
<P>"Oh, no," exclaimed the children at the &s;ame in&s;tant. "Suffer me to remove it," &s;aid the Colo|nel, "I know where God would have it put."</P>
<P>"Pray, pray," &s;aid Eleanor, holding her little hands towards him, "do not take it away: we &s;hall die if we do not &s;ee poor Derley."</P>
<P>By dint of argument and entreaty, the Colonel, however, at length prevailed; he drew from them a reluctant con&s;ent, and drawing the corp&s;e of the unfortunate Derley from the cavern, he began to examine it, hoping to form from it &s;ome conclu&s;ions relative to the fate of the two little &s;trangers. Di&s;|figured as it was, it appeared to be that of a man about thirty years of age, tall and well ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e: his cloaths, upon being touched, fell into rags; but the Colonel picked up a watch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">et with dia|monds,

The box, he ob&s;erved al&s;o, had a double bottom, in which he found a letter, which he opened precipitately, but it was &s;o macerated, that among others entirely defaced, he could only di&s;tingui&s;h the following words&mdash;</P>

<P>Finding nothing more upon the corp&s;e, except|ing &s;ome guireas, a kni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and a pocket|book ab&s;olutely in a&s;hes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e re&s;olved to inter it.

"Oh," they replied, "we

loved him too much to take any thing from him, and then we did not know he had all the&s;e pretty things."</P>
<P>"You have never then &s;earched him?" &s;aid the Colonel."</P>
<P>"Never," &s;aid Ambro&s;e, "we only looked at him and then wept."</P>
<P>"What re&s;pectful tenderne&s;s!" exclaimed the Co|lonel. His thoughts then reverted to the interment of the corp&s;e. He had ob&s;erved in an adjacent vale, a little mount which ro&s;e covered with myrrh trees, and over&s;haded by four palms. To this &s;pot he im|mediately repaired, and having with a branch of the Bi&s;chalo, the hard wood of which the negroes u&s;e for the con&s;truction of their cabins, dug a grave, he depo&s;ited in it the remains of the unfortunate Derley, while his two little friends beheld the mournful ceremony bathed in tears.</P>
<P>He then &s;truck fire from a neighbouring rock, a wonder which much &s;urpri&s;ed the children, and burnt upon the grave the clothes of the decea&s;ed, adding a quantity of mint, cloves, and other fragrant herbs that grew near, to purify the air. Ambro&s;e and Eleanor could not depart without ca&s;ting many a

lingering glance towards a &s;pot which contained in their eyes an ine&s;timable trea&s;ure. They walked&mdash;&s;topped&mdash;walked&mdash;and would again retrace the &s;ame &s;teps to bid an eternal adieu to their good friend.</P>
<P>In the mean while t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;un inclined toward the We&s;t, and the &s;ea, as they a&s;cended the valley, re|flecting his crim&s;on rays, appeared a va&s;t plain of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ire. Arriving on the &s;hore, the Colonel &s;topped to admire the glories of the &s;cene, and the children, forgetting their grief, walked hand in hand toward the rocks, and amu&s;ed them&s;elves with collecting &s;hells and &s;ea-weeds. For &s;ome minutes the Colo|nel lo&s;t &s;ight of them, but Eleanor &s;oon returned out of breath, to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll him that her brother and &s;he had di&s;covered a great thing which they believed to be a fi&s;h.

Saying this, &s;he led him among the rocks, where they found Am|bro&s;e attentively examining &s;omething which the Colonel &s;oon di&s;covered to be a large bundle of ham|mocks which the returning tide had driven on &s;hore. This &s;ugge&s;ting to him the idea of recovering from the wreck &s;ome articles that might &s;often the &s;everity of his misfortune, an idea which had not till this moment occurred to him, he began to &s;earch diligent|ly

"You do not eat, brother," &s;aid Eleanor; "nor you, &s;i&s;ter," returned Ambro&s;e; and then they both fell greedily upon their meats, which pre&s;ently di&s;|appeared.

Then Derley was very angry, and &s;eized that naughty man by the throat, but he drew a very long great knife, and run it into his belly. Then &s;everal ugly men came in, and put us and Derley into a little boat, that went upon the water much fa&s;ter than the wooden hou&s;e.

Derley fell down, and lay along time upon the ground: at la&s;t he got up very &s;oftly, and took us by the hand, and walked to the cave, where you know we lived, father, till you came; but as &s;oon as he got in he fell down again, and dragged us upon him.

We did not much like the looks of them, but I was &s;o hungry, that I &s;oon took courage to break one, and Eleanor and I &s;wallowed them one after another, and found them nicer than the eggs we had eaten with mama. It was very lucky, father, that we found them, for we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as if we &s;hould fall and die for want of food; but after we had eaten the eggs we grew &s;trong again, and began to &s;peak of what had happened to us.

the water, and &s;ucked till we were no longer dry. In this manner, father, we lived for &s;everal &s;uns, and were only &s;orrowful when we entered the cave where poor Derley continued to &s;leep without &s;peak|ing: &s;till we hoped he would wake, and a thought one &s;un came into my head, as we &s;tood on the &s;ea|&s;hore, looking at the great fire which &s;hines in the heavens.

<P>Ambro&s;e cea&s;ed &s;peaking, and the Colonel was &s;ilent a few minutes, to admire the hand of Provi|dence in the pre&s;ervation of the&s;e innocents!

At length, taking Ambro&s;e by the hand, "The de&s;ire you expre&s;s, my &s;on," &s;aid he, "of knowing that powerful and beneficent Being, who has miracu|lou&s;ly pre&s;erved you amid&s;t the&s;e de&s;erts, &s;hall be gratified: too great to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ender him&s;elf vi&s;ible to his weak creatures, know, my child, that, from the height of Heaven, he watches over the conduct of

"The earth!" inter|rupted Ambro&s;e, "do you mean the country where we live?" "The earth, my children, I need not tell you," &s;aid the Colonel, "is the ground on which we tread, but it con&s;i&s;ts not only of this i&s;land, it extends beyond the &s;eas, and contains four great countries, which are called EUROPE, ASIA, AFRICA, and AMERICA, which la&s;t is the part of the world we are now in."</P>
<P>"Then this I&s;land," &s;aid Ambro&s;e, "is Ame|rica?"</P>
<P>"No," replied the Colonel," but it makes a part of it."</P>
<P>"We do not," &s;aid the children, "under&s;tand you." "When you are further in&s;tructed," &s;aid the Colonel, "when I &s;hall have taught you to read and write, you will perfectly comprehend all this: at pre&s;ent it will be &s;ufficient to acquaint you that this great Being, who is called God, created all things: the Sun, which has hitherto been the object of your adoration, and which communicates light and heat to all nature, was formed by his

<P>Ambro&s;e and Eleanor li&s;tened to this di&s;cour&s;e with an attention from which their friend drew the happie&s;t pre&s;age: the day pa&s;&s;ed in&s;en&s;ibly away; they &s;upped in the new cabin, and afterward pre|pared to occupy their hammocks. Eleanor bu&s;ied her&s;elf for &s;ome time about her chamber: &s;he walked in it a great while, and did not go to &s;leep till &s;he had twenty times examined and changed the place of the little furniture it contained. The Colonel and Ambro&s;e, neighbours to each other, di&s;cour&s;ed for &s;ome time: then re&s;igning them&s;elves to the pow|ers of &s;leep, they enjoyed an uninterrupted repo&s;e. The ri&s;ing &s;un at length enlightened the cabin, when the Colonel, finding that his pupils were &s;till bu|ried in a profound &s;leep, took them gently by the

hand, and with plea&s;ure &s;aw them open their eyes, &s;tretch fir&s;t one arm, then the other, rai&s;e their heads, and &s;mile on him with an inexpre&s;&s;ible grace. "You &s;hould give an example to your &s;i&s;ter, Am|bro&s;e," &s;aid he, "and be before hand with the Sun." "Forgive me, dear father," &s;aid Ambro&s;e, but we have &s;lept in &s;uch a good bed!"</P>
<P>"It is enough, my &s;on," replied the Colonel, "but to-morrow, and every future day, you mu&s;t at day-break repair both of you to the &s;ea &s;hore, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er your thanks and prayers to the Being who has pre&s;erved you during the night." This the chil|dren a&s;&s;ured him they would not fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of doing.</P>
<P>Having erected and furni&s;hed his little dwelling, the Colonel was re&s;olved to vi&s;it the interior part of the I&s;land, that he might more particularly examine its vegetable productions, and execute the projects he had formed: he accordingly &s;et out, and had not advanced far before he di&s;covered plains covered with rice and maize, and manioque. The&s;e were the principal objects of his pur&s;uit: with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the children, about two bu&s;hels of maize was gathered, and conveyed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the cabin. Some handfuls of this was &s;pread upon the
<PB N="42" REF="035098_0040_1000B5DB09854568">
turf, and expo&s;ed to the &s;corching heat of noon, which &s;oon dried it &s;ufficiently to grind. The Colo|nel then made, in a rock, a hole in the form of a mortar, and with a pe&s;tle of wood broke the grains, and reduced them to powder, It was then nece&s;|&s;ary to winnow it, that the chaff might be &s;eparated from the grain, and this he performed by &s;haking it violently in a cloth, which Ambro&s;e and Eleanor held extended: afterwards it was ground into flour between two &s;tones, and diluted with water. A little brandy being mixed with this pa&s;te, by way of leven, it was put to bake upon flints &s;trongly heated by the fire, and thus a bread, very light and agreeable to the palate, was made. While the chil|dren watched the bread, the Colonel returned to make fre&s;h di&s;coveries: he found, as he proceeded into the i&s;land, a great deal of millet, but different from that of Europe, and fine potatoes, which he knew would afford them excellent nouri&s;hment; he di&s;covered al&s;o &s;ome green figs, and a variety of whole&s;ome and delicious fruits common to America; but for the&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary to go far into the i&s;land, which became an inconvenience: to remedy it, therefore, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his little pupils, he dug up and &s;owed a piece of land, near the cabin,
<PB N="43" REF="035098_0041_1000A34E52167670">
which extended from the &s;ea &s;hore to the fore&s;t, which &s;erved as its boundary. This &s;ort of orchard in the end, furni&s;hed them with maize, rice, millet, pota|toes, and all the mo&s;t u&s;eful and delicious productions of the &s;oil.</P>
<P>The Reader having now &s;een our i&s;landers fur|ni&s;hed with the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;aries of life, will not, perhaps be di&s;plea&s;ed to learn in what manner they employed their time. In the morning the Colonel took Ambro&s;e into the woods with him to hunt, having for this nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;e fabricated a bow about three feet and a half long, the &s;tring of which was a gut twi&s;ted, and the arrows a &s;tick furni&s;hed with two feathers, and terminated by a flint &s;harp|ened: with the&s;e they killed the different animals that inhabited the woods, &s;uch as &s;tags, goats, does, and among the birds, the duck and the foken, which furni&s;hed them with excellent food. Du|ring this time Eleanor was employed in baking the bread, or in other little offices of dome&s;tic econo|my. On returning, they bu&s;ied them&s;elves in col|lecting the eggs which were depo&s;ited by different fi&s;h upon the &s;ea beach, but e&s;pecially by the tor|toi&s;e and alligator: the la&s;t mentioned is &s;o &s;ingular that a &s;hort de&s;cription of it may be de&s;erving the
<PB N="44" REF="035098_0042_1000B5DDE9CB47A0">
attention of the Reader. The alligator is a &s;ort of crocodile common to America: its head is large, and its jaws furni&s;hed with &s;trong teeth, two of which e&s;pecially are extremely long; it has four legs, which are very &s;hort, and terminate by large feet, and its back from the head to the tail is cover|ed with &s;trong &s;cales, as al&s;o two large lumps which are over the eyes; its &s;tomach is furni&s;hed with four glands, and its tail always drags on the ground. This animal lives indifferently on land or water, and is not mi&s;chievous but when provoked: its eggs are e&s;teemed a great dainty. The cultivation of their field next engaged the attention of the Colonel and his pupils, after which they dined, and &s;pent the afternoon in &s;tudy or in gardening.</P>
<P>Nothing could exceed the attention of Ambro&s;e and Eleanor to the le&s;&s;ons of their friend, who had found the means of teaching them, not only to read, but to write. He had di&s;covered in the woods a tree much re&s;embling the fimpi of the I&s;le of Ma|daga&s;car: its bark, after being expo&s;ed to the &s;un, became as white as paper, and though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;melt a lit|tle of mu&s;k, this was ea&s;ily weakened by expo&s;ing it to the fumes of aromatic herbs: at the foot of this flowed a &s;ort of gum, much like that of the

Indian fig-tree, the &s;ap of which is u&s;ed by the In|dians to colour their ve&s;&s;els black. Being thus fur|ni&s;hed with paper and ink, he &s;oon added pens; he &s;haped them with his knife, and put them into the hands of his young pupils, who were &s;oon able to write and read, and con&s;equently to feel the value of tho&s;e books (for among them were &s;ome of the be&s;t authors) which had been taken from the wreck. "Pray, father," &s;aid Ambro&s;e one day, laying down a book, "explain to me why they have kings in the countries I read of." "Men living in &s;o|ciety, my &s;on," &s;aid the Colonel, "in which there are good and bad, it is nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h rulers, that order and peace may be maintained."</P>
<P>"I do not under&s;tand you," &s;aid Ambro&s;e.&mdash;"I will endeavor," replied his friend, to ex|plain my&s;elf more clearly; &s;uppo&s;e, now, for ex|ample, there were in this i&s;land a great many men and women who lived together in common, can you not conceive that one would wi&s;h for the field of his neighbour, that another would cut the throat of his enemy without pity; that this man would enter our cabin to &s;eize upon our food, and that drive us from it to e&s;tabli&s;h his own re&s;idence in it?</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="035098_0044_1000B5DF6F941590">
"How!' exclaimed the children with a&s;toni&s;h|ment, "are men capable of this?'</P>
<P>"I am a&s;hamed, my children," &s;aid the Colonel, to reply that they are; and that, unfortunately, the number of the wicked &s;urpa&s;s that of the good." "Ah, Eleanor," exclaimed Ambro&s;e, "let us &s;tay in our i&s;le!"</P>
<P>"Hear me to an end," interrupted the Colonel; "what I have &s;aid granted, you will &s;ee that it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h laws to render our habitations and property &s;ecure, and al&s;o to inve&s;t certain indi|viduals with a power to enforce tho&s;e laws: this power is not, however, always inve&s;ted in one man, but &s;ometimes in a certain number cho&s;en by the body of the people; this form of government is called a republic; the other, where a king governs, a monarchy."</P>
<P>"I comprehend very well what you &s;ay, father," &s;aid Ambro&s;e, but is it not &s;trange that men &s;hould be &s;o wicked as to render the&s;e laws nece&s;&s;ary?</P>
<P>"It is a melancholy proof, my &s;on," replied the Colonel, "of the depravity of human nature: from pride, envy, ambition, and avarice, vices, which are the more dangerous in community, as opportunities

<P>"Pray, father, &s;aid Ambro&s;e, "what is ava|rice?"</P>
<P>"An inordinate de&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing more than we can enjoy," &s;aid the Colonel: "you will &s;carcely believe, my child, that there are beings who po&s;&s;e&s;s great wealth, and bury, without employing it."</P>
<P>"In what, then," &s;aid Ambro&s;e, con&s;i&s;ts the riches of your country, father?"</P>
<P>"Alas, my &s;on!" returned the Colonel, "it is tho&s;e mi&s;erable pieces of gold and &s;ilver which con|&s;titute all the happine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s and mi&s;ery of life."</P>
<P>"What! tho&s;e," exclaimed the children, "that you found upon Derley?</P>
<P>"The &s;ame," replied the Colonel; tho&s;e pieces &s;tamped with the image of the ruling power are divi|ded into &s;mall and great coin, each of a proportion|ate value, and with the&s;e are procured all the com|modities of life."</P>

"Oh, I under&s;tand very well,' interrupted Am|bro&s;e, and I could willingly pardon them for &s;elling the works of art; if one man is wi&s;er or more &s;kil|ful than another, he de&s;erves a recompence: but to a&s;&s;ume a right over grain, wood, and all the common productions of the earth, that is indeed unrea|&s;onable."</P>
<P>"You do not reflect, Ambro&s;e," &s;aid the Colo|nel, "that all the&s;e productions of the earth require culture, conveyance, and a thou&s;and little cares which equally de&s;erve reward: is the man who tills a field, &s;ows it, and watches the vegetation of its produce, who gathers and carries it afterward into cities, obliged to take upon him&s;elf this trouble?

<P>"Your ob&s;ervation, my dear father," &s;aid Am|bro&s;e, "is very ju&s;t; I did not con&s;ider.'</P>

In&s;tinct is that natural &s;entiment which leads us to pre&s;erve our being, to tremble at the &s;ight of a wound, and to compa&s;&s;ionate an unfortunate being. Some philo&s;ophers have given to this la&s;t faculty the name of SYMPATHY. Whatever it be, it is that alone which animates animals, and di&s;&s;olves with their machines. INSTINCT &s;erves them in&s;tead of reflec|tion. The lizards do not, as you imagine, &s;ay, "Let us comfort ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> father."

The women, di&s;tingui&s;h|able by their children, which they carried on their backs, wore a pagne or cami&s;a round their wai&s;t, clo&s;er than that of the men, and about two or three inches deep.

Immediately the quadrupeds were &s;kinned, the fle&s;h out up, and the bones &s;eparated.

My ideas were confu&s;ed: I knew not what to think: I ca&s;t my eyes on the va&s;t plain of waters, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lightened by the moon: then I looked round for you, my dear ma&s;ter, but not &s;eeing you, and re|collecting the fatal events that had happened, my heart &s;unk, and per&s;uaded that you were &s;wallowed in the waves, an involuntary cry of horror and grief bur&s;t from me; this terrified the &s;avages who &s;ur|rounded me &s;o much, that they would have thrown me into the &s;ea, had I not, &s;eeing their de&s;ign, &s;of|tened them by my prayers and tears. One of them at length addre&s;&s;ed me in a jargon, compo&s;ed of Engli&s;h, Dutch, and French, of which I compre|hended, "<HI>From whence come you, White?</HI>"</P>
<P>"A ve&s;&s;el," I replied, "in which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ailed has been wrecked, and I &s;hould without doubt have pe|ri&s;hed, had you not pre&s;erved me."</P>

<P>"I have only a knife."</P>
<P>"Give it me, White."</P>
<P>"There it is," &s;aid I, giving it to him.</P>
<P>"Come," returned he, "I will love thee: thou &s;halt be &s;lave to the Grand Cacique."</P>
<P>"Oh, Heaven!" I exclaimed, "where do you mean to take me?"</P>
<P>"To Friz," an&s;wered the negro, and you will be very happy."</P>
<P>"I now felt the full extent of my misfortune: I was condemned, I &s;aw, to &s;erve the negroes, who, from their &s;erocious a&s;pect, I doubted not were can|nibals; but lamentations were vain!

<P>"How?" interrupted the Colonel, "are the&s;e the Carribes, inhabitants of the Antilles?"</P>
<P>"The &s;ame, Sir," &s;aid Peter, "I was my&s;elf ig|norant of their name during a year, but I learnt it af|ter from a French &s;lave who lo&s;t his life in their &s;er|vice. The i&s;le we now inhabit, Sir, is no other than one of the Antilles, which apparently has not yet been di&s;covered."</P>
<P>"Ah, my good Peter," &s;aid the Colonel, what do you tell me? Am I &s;o near Cuba, St. Jago, St. Do|mingo, Porto Rico?"</P>
<P>"You undoubtedly are, Sir," &s;aid Peter, "but you mu&s;t ob&s;erve that the i&s;lands of which you &s;peak form the Great Antilles, whereas this we now inha|bit is in the Little Antilles.

The tran&s;ports to which the&s;e hopes gave birth being, at length, &s;omewhat calmed, Peter, at the reque&s;t of his ma&s;ter continued his narrative.</P>
<P>"The Carribes with whom I lived, Sir, have ve|ry little commerce with the Europeans; they put to &s;ea every year, and came into this i&s;land to kill buffa|loes, otters, birds, &amp;c. after which they go to the coa&s;ts inhabited by Europeans, and barter the &s;kins of the&s;e animals, ba&s;kets, lizards, and different &s;orts of eggs, for knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, hatchets, arms, European linnen, and e&s;pecially brandy. The day fixed upon for their la&s;t voyage, my ma&s;ter ordered me to bring
<PB N="75" REF="035098_0073_1000B5FF16A04C20">
into the canoe his hammocks, arms, and hou&s;ehold uten&s;ils: then having, according to the cu&s;tom of the&s;e idolaters, made libations to the good &s;pirits, we embarked to the number of fifty, as many women as men, and at the end of two days arrived at this i&s;land. As it was the fir&s;t time during four years, my ma&s;ter had made me the companion of his voy|age, I drew from it the happy pre&s;age of &s;oon &s;eeing an end to my captivity: for I doubted not meeting, on &s;ome of the coa&s;ts at which we &s;hould touch, Eu|ropeans whom I &s;hould find means to &s;often in my favour and prevail on to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in my e&s;cape. Alas! I fore&s;aw not the i&s;&s;ue of that unhappy day. At the end of their brutal repa&s;t, my ma&s;ter, intoxicated with brandy, ordered me to fill him another gla&s;s: I imprudently ventured to repre&s;ent to him mildly the injury he would do him&s;elf; but in&s;tead of tak|ing this as a mark of my good-will, he &s;eized me by the throat; "Ah, dog of a white," &s;aid he in a rage, "thou ha&s;t without doubt robbed me&mdash;Die, and may thy thou&s;and &s;ouls go to the &s;eas, to en|crea&s;e the &s;torms, and form the fires of Heaven!" Saying this, he g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ve me &s;everal &s;tabs with a knife; but none of them were happily directed to the heart.

<P>Eleanor and Ambro&s;e who had li&s;tened very at|tentively to Peter's narrative, were highly incen&s;ed again&s;t the Cacique, and expre&s;&s;ed their indignation in very forcible terms; but Peter endeavoured to mo|derate it, by ob&s;erving that the Carribes, though ca|pricious and cruel, were only &s;o when contradicted. "They cannot," &s;aid he, "bear to be dictated to; their pride upon this point is inconceivable; but they are humane, and have great compa&s;&s;ion for women and children."</P>
<P>This led the Colonel to make &s;ome enquiries con|cerning the laws and manners of the Carribes, and, e&s;pecially, whether they were as &s;anguiuary and fond of feeding upon human fle&s;h, as they were repre&s;ented by Europeans.</P>
<P>"Nothing, Sir," &s;aid Peter, "can be more fal&s;e; they are certainly anthropophagi, or man-eat|ers, but it is from accident, not national ta&s;te; if they devour their enemies, it is in the tran&s;port of fury, in the heat of conque&s;t, and even upon the

field of battle. They do not like to be called &s;avages;&mdash;this name, they &s;ay, belongs to bea&s;ts of prey: they equally dete&s;t that of a cannibal, which is with them equivalent to man-eater; but they are very fond of the title of Carribes, becau&s;e in their primitive language, this word &s;ignifies a good warrior, a cou|rageous man. The Carribes are in general tall and well proportioned; they have agreeable features ex|cept the forehead, which is flat and much &s;unk, a de|fect which gives them a ferocious air, and ari&s;es from a cu&s;tom they have of pre&s;&s;ing the heads of their in|fants with a little board, tied fa&s;t behind, and left there till the fore head has taken the form they wi&s;h, and is become &s;o flat, that without rai&s;ing the head they can &s;ee almo&s;t perpendicularly above them.</P>
<P>"This cu&s;tom," &s;aid the Colonel, "is not peculiar to the Carribes; it is common to the &s;avages in other parts of America, and it is &s;aid to render the &s;kull &s;o hard, as frequently to have broken the &s;words of Eu|ropeans when they made the conque&s;t of Peru."</P>
<P>"The Carribes, Sir," &s;aid Peter, 'dye their &s;kins red, not only for ornament, but to pre&s;erve them from being injured by the inten&s;e heat of the &s;un, and al&s;o, to defend them from the mu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ettoes and

The women, who are &s;horter than the men, and have a more &s;prightly air, decorate them&s;elves with brace|lets, earings and necklaces of gla&s;s beads and blue &s;tones; from the age of twelve they wear al&s;o a &s;ort of cotton bu&s;kins, which reach about five or &s;ix inches above the ancle bone, and are wrought &s;o clo&s;ely to the leg that it is impo&s;&s;ible to take them off.&mdash;The ornaments of the men are feathers and &s;mall plates of a metal they call caracoli; the&s;e they wear at their ears, no&s;e, and under lip. The hou&s;es of the Carribes are called carbets, and like tho&s;e of the Indians of Guiana, are of a &s;ingular form; the lateral parts are of reeds, and the covering of palm leaves: the roof de&s;cending to the rafters, gives to the whole the form of a hive.

The women are very dexterous in a &s;ort of wicker work, of which they make their hammocks, and very curious ca&s;kets. In the&s;e ca&s;kets, which are &s;o neatly wrought that no water can enter, they enclo&s;e their jewels and attire, and when they go to &s;ea, fa&s;ten them to the edge of their canoes, that they may not lo&s;e any thing &s;hould they turn over, which very frequently happens. The Carribes, who took me out of the &s;ea, had encoun|tered, as we had, all the violence of the tempe&s;t, but without any alarm, tied like their ca&s;kets to their canoes, they follow the revolutions of the waves, turn with them, and continue their rout when the danger is pa&s;t. They have among them a &s;ort of religion; the &s;un and moon have all their adoration, but they have neither temple nor form of wor&s;hip. Some of their laws announce very good &s;en&s;e; &s;uch, for example, as the not electing a grand Cacique, till he has di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in war, and is cho|&s;en by a plurality of voices; he mu&s;t al&s;o have borne

<P>The Colonel agreed with Peter, that &s;uch a com|pari&s;on was by no means ju&s;t; and then added; "I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> has often &s;urpri&s;ed me that the children &s;hould, upon their arrival in the i&s;land, have found otter &s;kins, nay, I my&s;elf," &s;aid he, "found &s;ome very fine ones when I made my re&s;earches the day after the Carribes had been fea&s;ting."</P>
<P>"Do not the Carribeans," &s;aid he, "carry them away, or is it an act of forgetfulne&s;s?"</P>
<P>"The latter, Sir, &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d Peter, "appears to be the rea&s;on.

<P>Peter had nearly completed three &s;core years, but he was &s;till active and vigorous; his health being perfectly re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, he a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the tillage, grinding of corn, and at the mo&s;t laborious occupa|tions. He was extremely attached to the Colonel,

in who&s;e and his father's &s;ervice, he had pa&s;&s;ed his youth; he was therefore treated by him rather as a faithful friend, than a dome&s;tic, e&s;pecially now that one common misfortune united them. Peter &s;oon became attached to Eleanor and Ambro&s;e: he would &s;ometimes take them upon his knee, and give them le&s;&s;ons of morality which experience alone had taught him; and &s;ometimes he would play with them like a little child; &s;ing them Carribe &s;ongs, and gambol in the manner of the &s;avages.

Three years had revolved &s;ince the arrival of Peter, and &s;even &s;ince his &s;hipwreck, when the Co|lonel was one night alarmed by confu&s;ed cries or rather &s;houts near his cabin. He &s;tarted from his hammock, opened the door &s;oftly, and went out, but the night being extremely dark, he could not &s;ee any thing. The &s;houts &s;till continued, but &s;eemed at a much greater di&s;tance: he knew not what to think; but unwilling, till urged by nece&s;&s;ity, to alarm Peter or the children, who were all three bu|ried in &s;leep, he a&s;cended a hill that bounded his en|clo&s;ure to the north, and looking down, perceived an enormous cloud of &s;moke through which flames of every colour &s;oon found a pa&s;&s;age. The fore&s;t that bounds his enclo&s;ure is on fire! "Oh heavens!' exclaimed he, &s;eeing the &s;parks carried towards his cabin, "my children&mdash;Peter'&mdash;and &s;uddenly dart|ing from the hill he awakened Peter, took Eleanor in one hand, Ambro&s;e in the other, and flew with them to the &s;ea-&s;hore, while Peter, informed of all by the flames and &s;moke he &s;aw in the air, carried a few of the mo&s;t valuable effects of the cabin. He would have returned for what remained, but the wind blowing from the north, carried &s;o many lighted brands upon the little dwelling, that wholly

dried by the Sun, it became in a few minutes a prey to the flames. It is impo&s;&s;ible to form a ju&s;t idea of the grief and con&s;ternation of the Colonel and his three companions: the children ran&mdash;&s;creamed&mdash;and &s;eemed ready to throw them&s;elves into the flames to pre&s;erve their beloved abode, while the Colonel and Peter beheld the fatal cata&s;trophe buri|ed in a &s;tupid dejection. The Colonel, however, at length recovering his u&s;ual firmne&s;s, bent his &s;teps, followed by his little friends and Peter, toward the &s;ummit of a neighbouring rock, from whence, ca&s;ting his eyes round, he endeavoured to divine the cau&s;e of a conflagration &s;o fatal and unexpected. On one &s;ide they beheld only a va&s;t plain of fire, but looking towards the &s;ea, they &s;aw a croud of Carribes carrying off their e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ects, and embarking precipitately in their canoes. The flames threw a reddi&s;h reflection upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;avages, and rendered them vi&s;ible at the di&s;tance of half a league on the &s;ea, their arms extended, and their eyes fixed upon the burning fore&s;t. Little doubt remained but that the di&s;a&s;ter originated with them, and Peter, &s;ome|what recovered from his terror, &s;ugge&s;ted a very probable cau&s;e. "It is evident, Sir," &s;aid he, "that the Carribes have, as u&s;ual, landed to hunt
<PB N="81" REF="035098_0082_1000B60D5C437558">
in the fore&s;t, and it appears to me very probable tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> this accident may have happened through the &s;tratagem they make u&s;e of to catch the parrots, which, among other things, they barter with the Europeans.</P>
<P>"Why," &s;aid the Colonel, "do they u&s;e fire?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Sir," &s;aid Peter, "They ob&s;erve in the evening the trees upon which the&s;e birds perch, and when it is dark, tie to &s;ome of the lower bran|ches an earthen pot in which they put lighted wood, and upon it gum and pemento; the thick &s;moke which ari&s;es, renders the parrots &s;o giddy, that they fall down intoxicated, and become an ea&s;y prey to their pur&s;uers, who immediately &s;eize them, tie the feet and wings, and recover them by &s;imply throw|ing water upon their heads."</P>
<P>The my&s;tery was now unravelled; it was no longer difficult to account for an accident which had proved &s;o fatal to our i&s;landers; but alas! the di&s;|covery of the cau&s;e did not dimini&s;h the calamity.</P>
<P>At break of day they de&s;cended from the rock, and returned to the &s;pot where once their beloved habitation had &s;tood. In&s;tead of it they beheld a
<PB N="85" REF="035098_0083_1000B60F0DECED18">
heap of &s;moking a&s;hes! no furniture! no books! no &s;helter! they mu&s;t forego all.</P>
<P>In the mean while the fire raged with violence in the fore&s;t; at the end of twelve days it was not ex|tingui&s;hed, and would undoubtedly have con&s;umed the whole i&s;land, had the fore&s;t been adjacent to others; but it was ab&s;olutely alone, forming a &s;ort of thicket in the mid&s;t of an immen&s;e plain: be|&s;ides, the wind blowing from the north, carried the flakes of fire upon the cabin only, and con&s;equently towards the &s;ea.</P>
<P>During the&s;e twelve days, the Colonel was re|volving in his mind different plans, and was undeter|mined which to pur&s;ue. He &s;aw plainly that he mu&s;t build another habitation if he remained in the i&s;land: but he did not &s;top here: the idea of making his e&s;|cape from it had long been the favorite &s;ubject of his meditations; he had conceived a project which he believed to be practicable though hazardous, and no|thing had prevented his putting it into execution, but his affection for Eleanor and Ambro&s;e, who&s;e ex|treme youth had hitherto rendered them le&s;s able to encounter the dangers and fatigues that mu&s;t unavoid|ably attend the enterprize; but now that he was &s;tripped of all, that he found him&s;elf once more on

the i&s;land without habitation, without furniture, without any thing to render his abode in it de&s;irable, he began again to revolve his favourite project. "If it were po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "to con&s;truct a canoe. My tools cannot be con&s;umed, I &s;hall find them among the a&s;hes. If, I &s;ay, it were po&s;&s;ible in this canoe to gain the i&s;lands inhabited by Europe|ans! The Antilles form a half circle, &s;o that if we mi&s;&s;ed one we &s;hould unavoidably arrive at another; Cuba, St. Domingo, Jamaica, any of tho&s;e i&s;lands would facilitate our return to England. What a de|lightful reflection! But, may we not," &s;aid he, re|collecting him&s;elf, "fall into the hands of the Car|ribes, by whom we are to all appearance &s;urround|ed? My own life I have a right to ri&s;k, but ought I to expo&s;e to &s;lavery, to the dangers of &s;hipwreck, two unfortunate children, for whom Heaven has ren|dered me re&s;pon&s;ible? The Colonel re&s;ted &s;ome time on this idea; but the hope of &s;eeing England, and of re&s;toring to &s;ociety two beings who&s;e hearts and manners he had formed, in the end prevailed, and he re&s;olved to hazard all rather than give up an enter|prize that flattered him with &s;uch plea&s;ing pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>His plan well dige&s;ted, he communicated it to Peter; but this wary dome&s;tic, far from approving,

remon&s;trated with his ma&s;ter upon the danger of the enterprize. "Ah, Sir," &s;aid he "reflect, con&s;ider, I be&s;eech you, what will be the con&s;equence, &s;hould we again expo&s;e our&s;elves to the fury of an element that has already proved &s;o fatal to us."</P>

<P>"Do not be alarmed about that, Peter," &s;aid the Colonel: we can &s;teer towards St. Domingo, or &s;hould we mi&s;s that, we &s;hall find other of the Antilles inhabited by Europeans."</P>

More he &s;aid to this pur|po&s;e, till Peter, overcome at length by arguments and importunities, con&s;ented to embark in an enter|prize of which he clearly fore&s;aw all the dangers;&mdash;more perhaps than really exi&s;ted, for being him&s;elf ignorant of geography or navigation, he beheld the &s;ucce&s;s of the voyage as much more uncertain than the Colonel.</P>
<P>The children leaped for joy; the plea&s;ure of go|ing on the &s;ea, of &s;eeing &s;trange countries, rendered them blind to the perils they were to encounter; they &s;aw only the end of the voyage, without be&s;towing a thought on the accidents that might interrupt it.</P>
<P>The enterprize being re&s;olved upon, they began to remove the a&s;hes, and &s;eek for their tools, which they happily found in a &s;tate fit to make u&s;e of, ex|cepting that it was nece&s;&s;ary to whet them, and to make new handles, which was the bu&s;ine&s;s of three days.

One of tho&s;e trees was without lo&s;s of time rooted up, the trunk out to about the length of fifteen feet, and the bark &s;tripped of. It was then put upon the &s;tocks, and with the help of fire and hatched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ollowed, a work that was very long and laborious. The bot|tom remained flat, and the &s;ides four feet high and fif|teen inches thick, inclined rather inward. The two extremities, lengthened into a point, turned up a little, that the ve&s;&s;el might the more ea&s;ily tack about. Our workmen then &s;craped the &s;urface with flints, and thus compleated their canoe, which when fi|ni&s;hed was fifteen feet long, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ix wide, and four deep. A ma&s;t and rigging was next to be added, but this was not the mo&s;t difficult part of the work: a &s;trong branch was the mizen m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t; ru&s;hes woven into a mat made &s;ails, and the leaves of the palm tree twi&s;t|ed became &s;trong and &s;olid cordage.

The Colonel took the &s;ame precaution, and at the end of a month the little bark was fini&s;hed, and nothing remained but to launch it; a work which was per|formed with great ea&s;e; for the Colonel, having taken care to fix rollers under his &s;tocks, by means of a cap&s;tan the whole was gradually moved to the &s;ea, where the rollers were lo&s;t and the bark &s;wam.</P>

<P>Ambro&s;e and Eleanor li&s;tened with attention to the di&s;cour&s;e of their friend, and in &s;ilence lifted up their hearts to the Supreme Being, and implored his protection. They then with renewed vigor &s;et about conveying on board their little bark, the few articles that had been pre&s;erved from the conflagra|tion. Among the&s;e were their tools, and a Carribe ca&s;ket, containing &s;ome jewels, and the letter and articles found upon Derley. The&s;e la&s;t the Colonel had &s;o much at heart, from the hope that they might one day lead to a di&s;covery of Ambro&s;e and Elea|nor's parents, that he &s;ecured them about his own per&s;on, in ca&s;e of &s;hipwreck or other accident.

The&s;e reflecti|ons were neverthele&s;s counterpoi&s;ed by others more plea&s;ing: he &s;till flattered him&s;elf with arriving at a port of &s;afety, and the thought of returning to En|gland, once more lulled him in a plea&s;ing delu&s;ion. From this he was, at length, rou&s;ed by the return of light: the Sun gilt the tops of the mountains, and he aro&s;e in ha&s;te; but the children and Peter had been before hand with him and were amu&s;ing them&s;elves with carrying into the ve&s;&s;el different forts of grain, &s;alted fi&s;h, and other provi&s;ions that were previou&s;ly prepared, and, undoubtedly, very needful to undertake a voyage, the term of which was uncertain.

<P>In two hours all was ready, and nothing was thought on but &s;etting &s;ail, when on a &s;udden, Am|bro&s;e &s;eeming to recollect him&s;elf, entreated the Co|lonel for a few minutes to delay their departure.</P>

it was to the tomb of their good friend Derley. "Oh yes," &s;aid Eleanor, as they ran acro&s;s the plain, "indeed, we forgot; it was very ungrateful in us not to think of taking a la&s;t farewel of him." They pre&s;ently arrived at the grave, upon which, as a &s;mall memorial, they had placed large &s;tones &s;omething in the form of a tomb. Here, with full hearts, they pro&s;trated them&s;elves, hand in hand, and began &s;everal phra&s;es which they could not fini&s;h. "Farewel, farewel, Derley," &s;aid they. "Poor Derley! we &s;hall never &s;ee you more, but we will always think of you. Poor Derley!

"No," return|ed he, "it is not thunder." The noi&s;e was repeated a third time; their knees bent under them, and Elea|nor &s;unk without &s;en&s;e or motion on the turf. While Ambro&s;e was &s;upporting her, and endeavouring to

"Ri&s;e, ri&s;e, my dear Eleanor," &s;aid he, "we are called, it is the voice of our father;" but &s;ome time elap&s;ed before her &s;en&s;es returned. At length, &s;upporting her as well as he could, he ran precipitately toward the &s;ea-&s;hore; but in&s;tead of go|ing to that &s;ide from whence the voice proceeded, by a natural impul&s;e he took a path that led to that part of the &s;hore where they had left the Colonel and Pe|ter. They arrived at the &s;pot, but they were not there; their ve&s;&s;el was &s;till on the waves, but no o|ther trace of their friends remained.

with the greate&s;t rapidity. This &s;ight encrea&s;ed their grief; they doubted not but that their friends were in the ve&s;&s;el, and that the Carribes, or other enemies, had forced them from the i&s;land. Immovable with grief, their eyes &s;wimming in tears, they remained upon the rock till the bark had totally di&s;appeared, and then bur&s;ting a-new into a flood of &s;orrows, de|&s;cended with heavy &s;teps by a winding path, which brought them imperceptibly to a part of the &s;hore at &s;ome di&s;tance from that where they had a&s;cended: but what a &s;pect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">de of horror &s;truck their &s;ight! a disfigured corp&s;e, covered with blood, lay on the &s;ands! the upper jaw and &s;kull had been carried a|way; but the height and clothes corre&s;ponding, they doubted not but their generous protector lay extended before them.

His heart revived, upon ob&s;erving that the hands of the unfortunate victim were &s;mall and &s;oft, whereas tho&s;e of his friend were hard, and much &s;un-burnt; the Colonel wore no &s;tockings, the de|cea&s;ed did; and upon clo&s;e examination, he found that their clothes in many particulars differed.

be&s;ides being much &s;maller, he was habited in &s;kins. Convinced that it was neither the Colonel nor Peter, he flew to Eleanor, who began to revive, and com|municated the joyful intelligence; but the idea of its being their friend, had &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed her mind, that it was not till after &s;he had repeatedly que&s;tioned her brother, and examined the proofs, that &s;he could be per&s;uaded her &s;u&s;picions were un|founded. For further &s;atisfaction, Ambro&s;e &s;earched the pockets of the decea&s;ed, and found in them a pocket-book, knife, pipe and other articles, which they well knew their friend did not po&s;&s;e&s;s. This re|moved every doubt: tears of joy mingled with tho&s;e of woe were &s;hed on both &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es; it was not their friend&mdash;the dreadful certainty of his being no more was re|moved; and hope, if it did not &s;peak peace to their hearts, at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pended the violence of their grief.

to his &s;i&s;ter, that it was nece&s;&s;ary, in &s;ome way or other, to di&s;po&s;e of the unfortunate man before them. "Whether he were a friend or an enemy, Elea|nor," &s;aid he, "we owe him the duties of humani|ty: this was a le&s;&s;on taught us by our dear father, and &s;hall we neglect to practice it?"

They then, hand in hand, took their way along the &s;hore: the &s;ight of their little bark, at length, recalled the remembrance of their friend, and renewed the violence of their grief; they &s;topped to give vent to their tears, and then &s;itting down on the point of a ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, they for &s;ome minutes were lo&s;t in melancholy reflections: at length Eleanor broke &s;ilence: "I am per&s;uaded," &s;aid &s;he, "that the Carribes have forced them from the i&s;land." "There is more rea&s;on," returned Ambro&s;e, "to think that it was other enemies; the man whom we have ju&s;t buried is not a Carribe; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is dre&s;&s;ed like our father."</P>

<P>Ambro&s;e pau&s;ed a moment upon this idea. "What you &s;ugge&s;t, &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid he, "is certainly po&s;&s;ible; the unfortunate man we have &s;een may have lo&s;t his life in defence of our father, but the ve&s;&s;el we &s;aw was certainly very different from the canoes of the Carribes."</P>
<P>"It certainly," &s;aid Eleanor, "appeared very different; but the di&s;tance was great, our eyes might deceive us; for my part, I &s;carcely knew what I felt or what I &s;aw."</P>
<P>"That is true," &s;aid Ambro&s;e; "but yet I am &s;a|tisfied, from the de&s;cription I have heard from my father, that what we &s;aw was a European ve&s;&s;el."</P>
<P>"But the Carribes," &s;aid Eleanor, "are &s;o ac|cu&s;tomed to land upon this i&s;land&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Well," interrupted Ambro&s;e, "Carribes or Europeans, would to Heaven they had taken us with them! For my part, I would rather have en|dured &s;lavery, nay, death it&s;elf, than what I now feel."</P>

"I would ri&s;k every thing," &s;aid Eleanor, "were there a hope of di&s;covering him; but our &s;ucce&s;s is very uncertain; we may never reach the i&s;lands in|habited by Europeans, and if we do, may not&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Well," interrupted Ambro&s;e, provoked at the ob&s;tacles his &s;i&s;ter rai&s;ed to a project upon which his imagination, already began to be much heated, "I &s;ee that you are aver&s;e to what I propo&s;e."</P>
<P>"You cannot &s;urely think, brother," &s;aid Elea|nor, "that I am aver&s;e to any thing that can afford a rea&s;onable hope of &s;eeing again our dear father.

<P>"I agree, my dear &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid Ambro&s;e, "that it is po&s;&s;ible our enquiries may not prove &s;ucce&s;sful: but on the other hand, there is rational grounds to &s;uppo&s;e that they may.

a communication with each other; if we reach one, we &s;hall ea&s;ily extend our enquiries to others, and it will be hard indeed if we do not &s;omewhere gain the intelligence we &s;eek.

<P>"And do you really think, brother," &s;aid Elea|nor, half per&s;uaded to li&s;ten to a project, which though it at fir&s;t alarmed her, held out the &s;oothing hope of recovering their lo&s;t friends, "Do you re|ally think we may reach the i&s;lands you &s;peak of?"</P>
<P>"I am per&s;uaded that we may," &s;aid Ambro&s;e, "I do not pretend to &s;uppo&s;e that we are not to en|counter dangers and difficulties; but, my dear &s;i&s;ter, had circum&s;tances been rever&s;ed, had my fa|ther's fate been ours, and he left to lament our lo&s;s, do you think dangers or difficulties would have re|tarded his pur&s;uit?

<P>Such was the di&s;cour&s;e of Eleanor and Ambro&s;e before they left the cave.

The &s;un, in the mean while, had run more than half his cour&s;e, and the weather, which had till now been favourable, on a &s;udden changed: thick clouds ob&s;cured the air, the &s;ea ran high, and &s;ome drops of rain threatened an approaching &s;torm; all nature &s;eemed to prepare for a great revolution.

The weather, however, which continued foul till the middle of the night, at length cleared, and gave place to the Moon, which, reflecting her &s;ilver di&s;k

On the top of their ma&s;t &s;hone a light, which to their troubled imagination, &s;eemed fire de|&s;cending from heaven to con&s;ume their ve&s;&s;el. This, tho' an appearance familiar to mariners, &amp; the natural con&s;equence of a heated and damp atmo&s;phere, &s;truck them with inconceivable horror. They cla&s;ped each other clo&s;ely, and fixing their eyes upon the electric flame, had neither power to weep nor to &s;peak. Nor was this all; the &s;ea ran high. Some|times their little bark ro&s;e upon the billows, and then again &s;eemed to &s;ink, never to ri&s;e, into the depth of the va&s;t ocean. Death every in&s;tant pre&s;ent|ed it&s;elf to their view, and they could only wonder that they had not already met it in the waves.</P>
<P>Thirty hours they remained in this anxiety, &s;carce|ly daring to &s;tir, and only from nece&s;&s;ity taking a little of the nouri&s;hment their ve&s;&s;el afforded, At length, near the clo&s;e of the day, the wind chang|ing carried them towards a coa&s;t, which, on the fir&s;t view, appeared to be de&s;ert; but on approaching it they di&s;tingui&s;hed men running on the &s;ands, to ex|amine

their bark. Their hearts rebounded at the &s;ight of land; they perceived by the dre&s;s and colour of the i&s;landers, that they were not Carribes, and far from being alarmed, were in&s;pired with the great|e&s;t confidence. They rejoiced at the pro&s;pect of be|ing once more &s;afe upon land, and hoped &s;oon to hear news of the colonel and Peter, as if, (&s;uch was was their &s;implicity) all the world was obliged to know them.</P>
<P>When they were near land, a little boat took them on board, and carried them on &s;hore; but the a&s;toni&s;hment of the i&s;landers upon finding two child|ren habited in &s;kins, alone, in a bark ingeniou&s;ly con&s;tructed and furni&s;hed with different &s;orts of pro|vi&s;ions, is not ea&s;y to be de&s;cribed; a thou&s;and que&s;tions were in an in&s;tant put to them, to which they an&s;wered in Engli&s;h, have you &s;een Colonel Carlton or Peter?

<P>The i&s;landers, who were Spaniards, under&s;tood nothing of all this; but one among them, who knew Engli&s;h, acted as interpreter, and an&s;wered by a&s;&s;ur|ing them that they knew nothing of the per&s;ons of whom they &s;poke.</P>

The noi&s;e of their arrival, and the &s;ingular cir|cum&s;tances that attended it, &s;oon reached the ears of the Governor, to who&s;e palace they were conduct|ed amid&s;t a croud of people, whom curio&s;ity had drawn together.</P>
<P>The Governor viewed them with &s;urprize, put &s;everal que&s;tions to them, and &s;eemed to be much plea&s;ed with their youth and &s;implicity.

<P>The Governor thanked Ambro&s;e for his narra|tive; and ob&s;erving that re&s;t was nece&s;&s;ary after the fatigues they had undergone, ordered each to be con|ducted to a &s;eparate apartment. The thought of a &s;eparation, &s;ituated as they were among &s;trangers,

The men, my&s;elf only and a few others, from whom they judged they had nothing to fear, excepted, were all ma&s;&s;acred; the women alone, who were the objects of their treachery, were pre&s;erved, and tho&s;e a&s;&s;embled at the fete, being for the mo&s;t part di&s;&s;ipated and abandoned, ea&s;ily accommodated them&s;elves to the terms offered by Don Le&s;car.

<P>Eleanor and Ambro&s;e a&s;toni&s;hed and &s;hocked at all they heard, thanked the old man for his informa|tion, and expre&s;&s;ed their readine&s;s to be guided by his advice. Then &s;eeing their guide, he bade them farewell, telling them at parting, that he was called the Count d'Ore&s;ty.</P>
<P>Don Le&s;car upon their return, inquired how they liked his city? But ob&s;erving the impre&s;&s;ion of melancholy, which notwith&s;tanding their efforts to appear chearful, the di&s;cour&s;e of the Count d'Ore&s;ty had left upon their countenances, he expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;plea&s;ure.

<P>"Have patience," interrupted Don Le&s;car, "and be not &s;o elate; what I &s;ugge&s;t, is merely conjecture; I will tell you upon what grounds: My &s;ubjects frequently make &s;hort trips upon the &s;eas, for the purpo&s;e of taking prizes; it is not eight days &s;ince one of my captains &s;ailed with about a hundred and fifty men: now as the time agrees with that in which, by your account, your friends di&s;|appeared, it &s;eems very probable that he may have touched at the i&s;land, and borne them away to en|crea&s;e the inhabitants of my colony.

With the&s;e words he darted a furious glance upon Ambro&s;e, gra&s;ped the papers, and went out of the apartment, without pronounc|ing a &s;ingle word. The children looked at each other amazed: "What have we done?" &s;aid Eleanor.</P>
<P>"He thinks," &s;aid Ambro&s;e, "that the man who was killed upon our coa&s;t is his friend."</P>
<P>"Let us fly," &s;aid Eleanor, alarmed, "perhaps he will revenge his death upon us."</P>
<P>"And why fly?" &s;aid Ambro&s;e, "were that even po&s;&s;ible, when we may expect &s;oon to &s;ee our dear father; he will coun&s;el and defend us.</P>

<P>"It is for your &s;ake alone, Eleanor," &s;aid Don Le&s;car, "that I can forget the in&s;ults and arrogance of a youth, who is unworthy a &s;i&s;ter &s;o beautiful and intere&s;ting: my heart is already weighed down

him, except in the pre&s;ence of witne&s;&s;es, before whom it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cour&s;e of any thing in|tere&s;ting. During this time, Ambro&s;e and Eleanor had the mortification of hearing the mo&s;t horrid exe|crations be&s;towed upon the name of Carlton; he was now univer&s;ally believed to be the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of the naval Chief, and the arrival of the Verradian ve&s;|&s;el was awaited with impatience, to &s;acrifice both him and his accomplice, Peter, to the vengeance of the people. Eleanor and her brother, therefore, far from looking with joy, as formerly, to the mo|ment of his arrival, prayed fervently to Heaven that it might be retarded. In the mean while a de|lay &s;o unu&s;ual began to alarm the inhabitants, from the &s;uppo&s;ition of their ve&s;&s;el being captured, and a di&s;covery made of their retreat. The port was doubly guarded, and the whole colony put into a &s;tate of defence; but in a &s;hort time their fears in|&s;en&s;ibly decrea&s;ed, and lulled in indolent &s;ecurity, they returned to their former cour&s;e of luxury and di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>Eleanor and Ambro&s;e continued to be treated as the di&s;tingui&s;hed gue&s;ts of the Governor; but under this ma&s;k of kindne&s;s, it was ea&s;y to di&s;cern that he concealed an implacable hatred to Ambro&s;e,
<PB N="133" REF="035098_0131_1000B6420E118060">
he could not, without indignation, behold the pride and firmne&s;s of a youth whom he con&s;idered as a &s;avage; the &s;trictne&s;s of his principles, and the &s;oli|dity of his arguments, always on the &s;ide of virtue, incen&s;ed him; the un&s;haken attachment too which he at all times di&s;covered to his dear friend, and the freedom with which, even at the peril of his life, he expre&s;&s;ed his &s;entiments on this &s;ubject, was another cau&s;e of his di&s;gu&s;t; in &s;hort, his hatred aro&s;e to &s;uch a pitch, that had it not been for Eleanor, it is probable he would have &s;acrificed him to his re&s;ent|ment. She, however, more &s;oft and gentle, medi|ated between her brother and Don Le&s;car, and thus warded off the blow that might otherwi&s;e have proved fatal. As ob&s;erved before, Eleanor was now nearly fifteen; &s;he was tall, and well-made; her &s;un-burnt complexion was fre&s;h as the dew; her teeth were white and regular, and her large dark eyes &s;parkled with intelligence and vivacity: her hair flowed negligently in natural curls upon her &s;houlders, and there was a gentlene&s;s in her man|ners, and a grace in her lea&s;t motion, that rendered her whole figure inexpre&s;&s;ibly intere&s;ting. Don Le&s;car was &s;truck with her innocence and beauty, and from the fir&s;t moment of her arrival conceived
<PB N="134" REF="035098_0132_1000A3FA28903F30">
the idea of making her one day his wi&s;e. From this cau&s;e had ari&s;en the favours he had be&s;towed on her and Ambro&s;e; favours which they might ju&s;tly have claimed from humanity and ho&s;pitality; but Don Le&s;car was a &s;tranger to both, and was too depraved to be&s;tow upon other ground<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> than tho&s;e of &s;elf-convenience or &s;elf-gratification.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;e and Eleanor had now more than once &s;een and communicated their griefs to the Count d'Ore&s;ly; the good old man &s;incerely &s;ympathized in their &s;orrows, and by his coun&s;els endeavoured to confirm them in the principles of virtue; he often pointed out to them, in the wretched inhabitants of St. Verrado, the fatal effects of luxury and intem|perance; "behold," &s;aid he, "their features di&s;|torted, their con&s;titutions undermined, their rea&s;on ob&s;cured, their faculties decaying even before they have attained their due maturity, and their whole frame convul&s;ed with pa&s;&s;ions which degrade them far beneath the bea&s;ts which they de&s;pi&s;e; &s;uch, my children, is the price of plea&s;ures which cloy in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and which are pur&s;ued more, perhaps from habit than from inclination.

<P>"My dear children," &s;aid the Count d'Ore&s;ty, "your affection and gratitude charms, and intere&s;ts me &s;till more in your behalf; but re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, what|ever may be the cau&s;e, that the ve&s;&s;el which you have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e deprived you of your friends, will never more return to St. Varrado. Don Le&s;car him&s;elf, nay, every inhabitant of this i&s;land, has relinqui&s;hed all idea of it; who knows, therefore, Heaven may have pre&s;erved your friends; and that misfortune (if, as is generally believed the ve&s;&s;el has been captured) which may end in the de&s;truction of the colony, may have brought life and liberty to them: but however this may be, you are as likely, if God permits, to meet them in other countries as in this."</P>
<P>Eleanor and Ambro&s;e acknowledged the force of this argument, and were &s;oon per&s;uaded to enter into a me &s;ure, which the Count a&s;&s;ured them af|forded a much greater probability of di&s;covering

their friends than remaining at St. Verrado. They expre&s;&s;ed their readine&s;s to be guided by his advice, and enquired how he propo&s;ed to effect their e&s;cape?</P>
<P>The Count d'Ore&s;ty did not think proper at this time to di&s;clo&s;e his plans; he only coun&s;elled Am|bro&s;e to moderate his impetuo&s;ity, and keep up a friendly intercour&s;e with Don Le&s;car; on which he told them the &s;ucce&s;s of their enterpri&s;e would in a great mea&s;ure depend: he then departed, telling them to attend every day at the port, and that when he had dige&s;ted his plan, and arranged matters for its execution, he would talk more to them upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Eleanor and Ambro&s;e exactly followed the in|&s;tructions of their friend: they attended regularly, at the port, but a week elap&s;ed before they &s;aw the Count d'Ore&s;ty; at length he acco&s;ted them: "Well, my children," &s;aid he, "do you think you &s;hall have courage to tru&s;t your&s;elves once more on the &s;eas in your little bark?"</P>
<P>"Ah, father," &s;aid Ambro&s;e, "we commit our&s;elves wholly to your guidance; we have lo&s;t our dear Carlton, and think our&s;elves beyond mea|&s;ure

<P>"Talk not of perils," interrupted Ambro&s;e; "tell us only what we mu&s;t do&mdash;deliver us from Don Le&s;car&mdash;from this wicked place, &s;ince we mu&s;t no longer indulge the hope of &s;eeing our dear father."</P>
<P>"It is in your little bark, my children," &s;aid the Count, "that we mu&s;t attempt our e&s;cape; I have examined it, and find it &s;olid and well built; if we can once embark, I doubt not but I &s;hall be able to &s;teer &s;o, as to land you on &s;ome &s;hore in|habited by beings le&s;s cruel than tho&s;e among whom you now re&s;ide: from thence, if God &s;pare me &s;o long, I will convey you to England, where you may, perhaps, hear tidings of your friend; but much before remains to be done; your little bark, you &s;ee, is chained in the ba&s;in; the keys of the port mu&s;t therefore be obtained or we cannot pro|ceed in the enterprize. Do you think, Ambro&s;e,
<PB N="139" REF="035098_0137_1000B6481A734550">
that you would have courage to enter the apartment of Don Le&s;car, and get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them?"</P>
<P>"I could have courage," &s;aid Ambro&s;e, "to do any thing rather than live under a tyrant whom I de&s;pi&s;e and abhor&mdash;but how&mdash;"</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t take them," &s;aid the Count, "from under the head of Don Le&s;car while he &s;leeps."</P>
<P>"Oh Heaven!" exclaimed Eleanor, "&s;hould he awake! my brother's life&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Be not alarmed, Eleanor," &s;aid the Count d'Ore&s;ty, follow exactly my directions, and all will be well. If the wind, Ambro&s;e, continue in the &s;ame quarter as at pre&s;ent (for this will be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that it may blow us &s;wiftly from the coa&s;t) towards evening feign an excu&s;e to withdraw, and &s;teal privately into the chamber of Don Le&s;car, where you mu&s;t conceal your&s;elf till he retires to re&s;t."</P>

<P>The attempt was bold and hazardous; the exe|cution of it, if not impo&s;&s;ible, &s;eemed difficult and replete with dangers; but Ambro&s;e, tran&s;ported with the hope of e&s;caping from a country which he had in horror, and al&s;o with the thought of vi&s;iting England, where a probability remained of one day &s;eeing his deare&s;t friend, if he was &s;till an inhabi|tant of the earth, promi&s;ed every thing.

<P>Early in the evening, pur&s;uant to the in&s;tructions of his friend, Ambro&s;e, alledging indi&s;po&s;ition,

withdrew from the pre&s;ence of Don Le&s;car, and watching an opportunity, &s;lipt privately into his chamber, and concealed him&s;elf behind the hang|ings.

Eleanor watch|ed a favourable opportunity, and, with a beating heart, dropt the powder given her by the Count d'Ore&s;ty into his gla&s;s. Don Le&s;car &s;oon was &s;en|&s;ible of its power, and ri&s;ing, retired to his cham|ber. Let the Reader judge if po&s;&s;ible what were the feelings of Eleanor at this moment; the idea of her brother being concealed in the chamber of Don Le&s;car, of the dangers to which he was expo|&s;ed, of the double part &s;he had been acting, which obliged her to &s;mile with pretended &s;incerity on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> tyrant &s;he was deceiving, all ru&s;hed forcibly on her mind; &s;he threw her&s;elf into a chair, and bur&s;ting into an agony of tears, "Oh!" &s;aid &s;he, what is to be compared with &s;incerity and truth!

<P>In the mean while Don Le&s;car entered his cham|ber, and was &s;carcely &s;tretched upon his bed, before, as the Count d'Ore&s;ty had foretold, he &s;unk into a deep &s;leep, and gave Ambro&s;e, who boldly advan|ced to the bed, an opportunity of &s;eizing the keys, which, at this moment &s;eemed to him a greater trea&s;ure than the wealth of the Indies.

<P>"And what do you infer from that?" &s;aid the Count.</P>
<P>"I do not know," replied Eleanor, "but &s;ome|how I have an idea that we &s;hould find our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dea Carlton there."</P>

without knowing it; but the waves &s;eeming to drive the bark with more violence, he was fearful of being driven into the Canal of Bahama (not doubting but that he was near it) the rapidity of which is &s;o great, that it threatens in&s;tant de&s;truction. In con|&s;equence of this, by dint of oars and &s;ails, they worked the ve&s;&s;el, and the next morning found them|&s;elves near a coa&s;t, which, from the form of the buildings, and the colours of the ve&s;&s;els that were in the port, the Count judged to belong to the Engli&s;h. How great was the joy of our voyagers? The ve&s;|&s;el made into the port, and they landed amid&s;t a crowd of inhabitants, who put to them a thou&s;and que&s;tions, which the &s;ingularity of their dre&s;s, and the peculiar form of their ve&s;&s;el, naturally excited: they &s;oon, in their turn, learned that they were in the i&s;land of Providence, one of the Lucay I&s;les, &s;ituated upon the Canal of Bahama, that it belong|ed to the Engli&s;h, that Sir James Corpley was the Governor, and that they might expect from his hu|manity all the &s;uccour they could de&s;ire.

<P>At this moment, Peter, informed of what was pa&s;&s;ing, ru&s;hed precipitately into the apartment, and overcome by the exce&s;s of his joy, &s;unk, half faint|ing, at the feet of his young friends.

the little courage &s;hewn by his comrades in the action, reproached them &s;everely, and formally &s;ignified to them that they &s;hould not have any &s;hare of the boo|ty: this highly incen&s;ed them, and one of the number, named Burney, formed a con&s;piracy with the others to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate their Chief on the fir&s;t favourable op|portunity that &s;hould offer, to go to St. Domingo or Cuba, &s;ell their booty, and return to England, there to live quietly on their ill-gotten wealth.

Thus from &s;lavery and death were we unex|pectedly re&s;tored to life and freedom: I made my|&s;elf known, and communicated my &s;tory to the Cap|tain, who, upon our arrival at the I&s;le of Provi|dence, pre&s;ented me to Sir James Corpley, the Governor, with whom I had been formerly intimate in England: his reception was &s;uch as might have been expected from the mo&s;t generous of men; he was intere&s;ted in my misfortunes, and &s;ince that time has detained me his di&s;tingui&s;hed gue&s;t: but an im|portant expedition is now in agitation; &s;ix of the Verradian pri&s;oners, intimidated by the threats, and allured by the promi&s;es of the Governor, have con|fe&s;&s;ed the &s;ituation of the i&s;land they inhabit, and in a few days, four hundred men, of which Sir James has given me the command, will embark, to extir|pate this horde of robbers, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land in the name of the Engli&s;h Monarch: But do

not think, my children, &s;aid the Colonel to Ambro&s;e and Eleanor, that I was unmindful of your &s;ituation; I had permi&s;&s;ion from my friend to touch at our i&s;land, little &s;u&s;pecting that you had ventured to abandon it."</P>
<P>The Colonel thus terminated his recital, and re|ceived the thanks of all pre&s;ent. Ambro&s;e then recounted all that had happened &s;ince his &s;eperation from the Colonel; and his recital was continued by the Count d'Ore&s;ty, who&s;e courage and exerti|ons, in behalf of the amiable orphans were univer|&s;ally applauded. The Colonel again thanked him in the warme&s;t terms, and a friend&s;hip from that moment took place between them, which continued to the end of their lives. The generous Governor congratulated his gue&s;ts in the mo&s;t polite and friendly terms upon their re-union, appointed by Providence to take place in his i&s;land, which on this occa&s;ion, he ob&s;erved, ju&s;tified its name.</P>
<P>The happine&s;s of Eleanor and Ambro&s;e would have been complete, had it not been embittered by the thought of a &s;econd &s;eparation form their friend, on account of the expedion to St. Verrado; Am|bro&s;e earne&s;tly entreated to be permitted to accom|pany him, but the tears of his &s;i&s;ter, and the com|mands of the Colonel, to which he had been ac|cu&s;tomed

implicity to &s;ubmit, at length prevailed, and he relinqui&s;hed his reque&s;t. The Count d'Ore&s;ty, notwith&s;tanding his age, made one in the expedition, ju&s;tly con&s;idering that his knowledge of the i&s;land might forward the &s;ucce&s;s of the undertaking. Eleanor and Ambro&s;e accompanied their friends to the port, and with their eyes followed the little fleet, (con&s;i&s;ting of three &s;hips) till they could no longer di&s;tingui&s;h it: they then returned with heavy hearts to the Governor, who u&s;ed all his arguments to mitigate their &s;ears for the &s;afety of their friends, and to in&s;pire them with the hope of their &s;afe and &s;peedy return.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed as if Heaven favoured the expedition again&s;t St. Verrado; the weather continued favour|able, and at the end of three days, towards mid|night, the little fleet arrived before the i&s;land; the whole colony was buried in &s;leep, except the gaurds, who watched before the pali&s;ades, to pre|vent any one mounting the bank, and entering the ve&s;&s;els.</P>

One of the guards, however, e&s;caping, ran to the city, rang the alarm, and rou&s;ed the inhabitants, who &s;carcely awake, knew not what they meant, nor what enemies they had to encounter. The Engli&s;h di&s;per&s;ed in the &s;treets, attacked the Verradians, as they came out of their hou&s;es, and lighted brands &s;oon &s;et fire to the four corners of the city. Don Le&s;car a&s;toni&s;hed, thunder&s;truck at this &s;udden at|tack, at length a&s;&s;embled about two hundred men, and advanced in order for battle: the &s;laughter &s;oon became horrible; on one &s;ide, the Engli&s;h, armed with &s;words and bayonets, on the other, the Ver|radians vigorou&s;ly defending them&s;elves with enorm|ous ma&s;&s;es of bamboo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The bamboo here &s;poken of is not that of the Ea&s;t-Indies, which we frequently &s;ee converted in|to walking canes.

night, and the Colonel &s;atisfied with his expedition, thought of re-imbarking with his pri&s;oners: but what was his con&s;ternation! not a &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el, not a &s;ingle boat was to be &s;een in the ba&s;in. The men who were left with the little fleet, had di&s;per&s;ed them|&s;elves over the city to a&s;&s;i&s;t their people, and the treacherous Verradians had &s;eized this unguarded moment to &s;et fire to the &s;hips, as well to their own as to tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h. Both Colonel Carlton and the Count d'Ore&s;ty had heard the explo&s;ion cau&s;|ed by the blowing up of the magazines of powder; they had di&s;tingui&s;hed the Heavens red with the re|flection of the flames; but in the heat of combat, in the confu&s;ion that univer&s;ally reigned, they had attri|buted all to the conflagration of the city, which made a rapid progre&s;s. An event &s;o unexpected, did not a little embarra&s;s and mortify the Colonel; he &s;aw him&s;elf deprived of means to return to the I&s;le of Pro|vidence, where he had left his beloved pupils, and from whence he hoped &s;hortly to embark for Eng|land. Be&s;ides this, he was wholly de&s;titute of &s;hel|ter, or any thing nece&s;&s;ary to feed and lodge nearly four hundred of his own men, and upwards of three hundred pri&s;oners. He was con&s;trained, however, to accommodate him&s;elf to the&s;e difficulties, and as the only part there remained for him to take, order|ed
<PB N="159" REF="035098_0157_1000B6600BF6B2C8">
the hou&s;es that were &s;aved from the flames to be &s;earched for &s;ail cloth, cables and tools nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;truct a ve&s;&s;el. The&s;e were happily found, and the carpenters immediately &s;et to work. They la|boured without intermi&s;&s;ion day and night, and at the end of &s;ix weeks launched two little barks, un|worthy the name of &s;hips, &s;ufficient to contain the Colonel and about two hundred of his men, with whom he re&s;olved to embark, leaving the re&s;idue to guard the Verradian pri&s;oners. He took with him al&s;o twenty-five unfortunate women, who had long groaned in the pri&s;ons of St. Verrado. But before we take leave of St. Verrado, we mu&s;t acquaint the reader with an intere&s;ting event, that occurred during the Colonel's continuance in the i&s;land. One day having vi&s;ited different parts of the city that had e&s;caped the ravages of the flames, a Verradian, who was with him, pointed to the hou&s;e of their old com|mander, George Blake, as the large&s;t and be&s;t built in all the colony, excepting the Governor's. Curi|o&s;ity induced the Colonel to enter it; he a&s;cended into an upper chamber, and ob&s;erving a &s;mall cabi|net, forced it open to examine the contents. The&s;e were a few jewels, and &s;everal parcels of letters and papers, which he peru&s;ed with little attention, till the following attracted his notice.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="035098_0158_1000A4282B650628">
<Q>Why, my dear Eleanor, mu&s;t I deceive the be&s;t of fathers! Why is he blinded by ambition? Are not virtues, titles of nobility, and the quali|ties of the heart, ine&s;timable trea&s;ures? Oh, my wife, my children, why mu&s;t I not own you? Why mu&s;t you not find &s;helter in the arms of my venerable, my much re&s;pected father! but it can|not be. Make every thing ready for your depar|ture; I confide you to &s;afe hands; Derley accom|panies you, and my heart is ea&s;y; ki&s;s my Elea|nor and Ambro&s;e a thou&s;and times for me: how young they are to encounter the fatigues of &s;o long a voyage! but Heaven and the tender cares of a mother will protect them.

<P>The Colonel did not, the Reader will conclude, unmoved peru&s;e a letter, which, upon a compari&s;on, evidently appeared to be written by the &s;ame hand as that found upon Derley; the date was nearly the &s;ame, but it had no &s;ignature. He now &s;earched every part of the cabinet with the minute&s;t attention, and at la&s;t drew from a private drawer a picture of
<PB N="161" REF="035098_0159_1000A4538C5F9E28">
the mo&s;t intere&s;ting nature: it repre&s;ented a beautiful young woman holding two children; "It is Elea|nor! It is Ambro&s;e!" The Colonel called to mind their features at the time he fir&s;t entered the uninha|bited i&s;land, and traced the re&s;emblance undimi|ni&s;hed by the years that had then elap&s;ed. Eleanor was the exact re&s;emblance of her mother; Am|bro&s;e, more ma&s;culine, was building a hou&s;e of cards, upon which was written, "<HI>telle e&s;t la vie.</HI>" What an intere&s;ting di&s;covery! The features of the woman (though fre&s;h and lively) upon a compari|&s;on, evidently re&s;embled tho&s;e delineated in the gold box of Derley; but &s;till it threw no light upon the birth of his pupils. As he viewed the intere&s;ting miniture, a thou&s;and different ideas ru&s;hed upon his mind: By what means did the&s;e precious depo&s;its fall into the hands of the pirate? Could it be po&s;&s;i|ble his amiable pupils were the offspring of a wretch &s;o depraved; or had he plundered and de&s;troyed their unfortunate parents? His mind floated be|tween the&s;e two ideas, when a letter, written in a woman's hand, pre&s;ented it&s;elf, and threw &s;ome light upon the matter: it was as follows:</P>
<P><Q>At length, barbarian, I break the bonds in which you have for &s;ix months held me, and re|turn

to my country; but, alas! I return de&s;olate and wretched, deprived by thy mercile&s;s hand of of all that could render life de&s;ireable. Dete&s;ted wretch! where are my poor children? my Elea|nor, my Ambro&s;e? in what corner of the earth ha&s;t thou concealed them? Derley, the friend, the confidant of my hu&s;band, the only &s;upport of an unfortunate woman, is no more&mdash;Ah, without doubt, my children &s;leep with him in the night of the tomb. Oh, in&s;upportable, reflecti|on! I can no more; the moment is favourable, and I depart: but tremble, villain, the ven|of a ju&s;t God will pur&s;ue thee, and deliver the earth from a mon&s;ter who contaminates it.</Q></P>
<P>This letter evidently had a corre&s;pondence with the former; the names and date were the &s;ame, and upon a calculation, the Colonel found the time nearly approached the period in which his pupils were left upon the I&s;land: he no longer doubted, though ignorant by what means, but their misfor|tunes originated from this villain, to whom it ap|peared, by the &s;uper&s;cription, the letter was ad|dre&s;&s;ed. Hoping to make farther di&s;coveries, he enquired very particularly among the Verradians concerning their naval Chief, hoping from thence
<PB N="163" REF="035098_0161_1000A42DECC77C58">
to draw &s;ome conclu&s;ions, but he was di&s;appoint|ed; all that he could learn was, that George Blake was the Captain of an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el, who upon &s;ome mi&s;demeanor had been outlawed; that having rendered &s;ervices to Don Le&s;car, and, at la&s;t, a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed him in making his e&s;cape, the clo&s;e&s;t intimacy had exi&s;ted between them, and that he was con&s;i|dered as the mo&s;t daring and enterprizing of all the pirates. Not being able to gain any farther infor|mation, the Colonel &s;ecured the letters and picture, and embarked for the I&s;le of Providence. After five days &s;ail they arrived there, and were received with univer&s;al joy by the Governor and the whole i&s;land, but e&s;pecially by Eleanor and Ambro&s;e, who, alarmed at an ab&s;ence &s;o much longer than was expected, began to fear both the Colonel and the Count d'Ore&s;ty had fallen victims to the fury of Don Le&s;car; but their friends were returned, and all &s;orrow was bani&s;hed.</P>
<P>The arrival of the Colonel with his &s;uite, and the news of the victory, was celebrated with univer|&s;al demon&s;trations of joy; the brave &s;oldiers who fought under him were generou&s;ly recompen&s;ed, as well as the &s;ix Verradians who had been in&s;trumen|tal to the victory. The three hundred pri&s;oners ta|ken

at St. Verrado were &s;ent to the Governor of the Spani&s;h i&s;land of St. Domingo, as al&s;o a parti|cular account of the expedition.</P>
<P>Sir James Corpley, who was fond of &s;plendid entertainments, gave one at which the &s;oldiers who were &s;ent on the expedition to St. Verrado, and the unfortunate per&s;ons relea&s;ed from its pri&s;ons were pre&s;ent; nor could a &s;ight more intere&s;ting be con|ceived than this &s;ocial union of the heroes and the unfortunate per&s;ons delivered by their valour.</P>
<P>The reader will recollect that the ve&s;&s;el which delivered Colonel Carlton from the hands of the pi|rates bore letters of recall to the Governor of the I&s;le of Providence. As &s;oon, therefore, as he had &s;ettled the affairs of the i&s;land, as appointed by Government, he embarked for the Briti&s;h I&s;les, ac|companied by Colonel Carlton, the Count d'Ore&s;ty, Eleanor and Ambro&s;e, and the faithful Peter. With re&s;pect to the pri&s;oners relea&s;ed from the dungeons of St. Verrado, &s;ome of them &s;ettled in the I&s;land of Providence, and the re&s;t returned to their different countries.</P>
<P>What now could exceed the happine&s;s of Elea|nor and Ambro&s;e! returning to their country under

the conduct of their dear protector and the Count d'Ore&s;ty. The weather was favourable; the ve&s;&s;el arrived happily in port, and our voyagers being fur|ni&s;hed with cloaths and every thing nece&s;&s;ary to make their appearance as natives in England, &s;et out po&s;t for the metropolis. It is not ea&s;y to form a ju&s;t idea of the &s;en&s;ations of Colonel Carlton upon his arrival in a country which he had not &s;een for more than twelve years, and which contained trea|&s;ures, to him, of ine&s;timable value. The different revolutions that might have occurred in &s;o long a &s;pace of time naturally pre&s;ented them&s;elves to his mind, and alternately agitated him with hope and fear: he had left a wife and child whom he tender|ly loved&mdash;but death might long &s;ince have con&s;ign|ed them to the grave; or a &s;econd marriage, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of his death, might have embittered the remainder of his days. As he drew near Lon|don his fears encrea&s;ed, and while every one was elate with joy and gladne&s;s, he was melancholy and dejected. Upon his arrival, he went immedi|ately to the hou&s;e of a relation, where he was in|formed that &s;ince his &s;uppo&s;ed death, Mrs. Carlton had retired to a villa a few miles from the metropolis,
<PB N="166" REF="035098_0164_1000A430F1B16B98">
where, with her &s;on, &s;he lived wholly &s;ecluded from the great world. How grateful was this to the heart of the Colonel! Accompanied by his two pupils and the Count d'Ore&s;ty, he immediately &s;et out for the village, and towards evening arrived at an inn about a mile from the hou&s;e where Mrs. Carlton re&s;ided. Here he alighted and remained with Ambro&s;e and Eleanor while the Count d'Ore&s;ty took upon him&s;elf the nece&s;&s;ary office of preparing Mrs. Carlton for his reception. He introduced him&s;elf to her as a friend of the Colonel's, and mentioned at a di&s;tance a report of a few having been pre&s;erved from the wreck; then having in&s;pir|ed her with hope, he ventured to tell her that letters had been received from &s;ome of the crew; but when he announced the certainty of her hu&s;band's &s;afety, and, at la&s;t, that he was actually in Eng|land, notwith&s;tanding the caution with which it had been revealed, her &s;urprize and joy was &s;o great, that the Count did not think it prudent to acquaint her he was &s;o near, but contented him&s;elf, as the day was far advanced, with promi&s;ing her an inter|view the next morning. The de&s;cription he gave the Colonel, on his return to the inn, of his Lady's emotions on the unexpected news of his arrival, af|forded him heart-felt plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="035098_0165_1000B667C5C53BE0">
The next morning early, the whole group was a&s;&s;embled at the man&s;ion of Mrs. Carlton, who was already up, and, with her &s;on, a promi&s;&s;ing youth of &s;ixteen, impatiently a waiting the arrival of her hu&s;band. The meeting was too affecting to admit of de&s;cription: the Colonel alternately pre&s;&s;ed to his bo&s;om his wife and &s;on, and in the exce&s;s of hap|pine&s;s he enjoyed, forgot the years of angui&s;h that were pa&s;&s;ed, or remembered them only to heighten his pre&s;ent joy. The fir&s;t tran&s;ports of meeting be|ing over, the Colonel pre&s;ented Eleanor and Am|bro&s;e to his lady, telling her with a &s;mile, they were his adopted children, and that he hoped and tru&s;ted &s;he would not find them unde&s;erv|ing her protection. The e&s;teem of the Colo|nel was a &s;ufficient recommendation to Mrs. Carl|ton; though unacquainted with their &s;tory, &s;he cor|dially embraced, and pre&s;ented them to her &s;on Charles, who a&s;&s;ured his father he &s;hould from that moment con&s;ider them as his brother and &s;i&s;ter. In her turn, Mrs. Carlton introduced to the Colonel, by the name of Millar, a worthy clergyman, who had undertaken the care of their &s;on's education, as al&s;o a gentlewoman, about the age of thirty five, as the companion of her widowed hours. "Had it

<P>The joy of Eleanor and Ambro&s;e, on &s;eeing their generous protector thus happily re-united to his fami|ly, was &s;uch as might be expected from the &s;u&s;cepti|bility of their hearts: their eye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s were alternately fix|ed upon the Colonel, Mrs. Carlton, and Charles, never wearied with contemplating the happine&s;s that was expre&s;&s;ed in the countenance of each. The Count d'Ore&s;ty, and all pre&s;ent, &s;hared in the gene|ral joy; and it was not, perhaps, po&s;&s;ible to find a happier group than that a&s;&s;embled at the breakfa&s;t|table of Mrs. Carlton. The adventures of the Colo|nel, at length, became the topic of conver&s;ation, and at the reque&s;t of his Lady and friends, he re|counted the principal events that had occurred &s;ince he left England; he mentioned his &s;hipwreck on the uninhabited i&s;land, his di&s;covery of Eleanor and Ambro&s;e, and did not forget the many little incidents that occurred to illu&s;trate the goodne&s;s and &s;implicity of their hearts. This part of the narrative &s;eemed to make a &s;ingular impre&s;&s;ion on the Lady, whom Mrs.

Carlton had introduced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her companion and friend during the ab&s;ence of her hu&s;band; &s;he lo&s;t not a word, and more than once her eyes were ob&s;erved to be dim with tears; but when the name of Derley was mentioned, her countenance underwent a total alteration; &s;he grew pale, and ca&s;ting her eyes round with a wildne&s;s that alarmed every one pre|&s;ent, reque&s;ted to &s;ee the letter and box found upon him. The Colonel produced them; and the &s;tran|ger immediately exclaimed, "My children!" and fell back &s;en&s;ele&s;s in her chair. All aro&s;e in ha&s;te to give the nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;he revived; and Eleanor and Ambro&s;e, no longer doubting but they had found their mother, threw them&s;elves on their knees before her: "Yes," &s;aid &s;he, bending on them an eye of tender &s;crutiny, "it is my Eleanor&mdash;my Ambro&s;e too! the living image of his lament|ed father; my heart from the fir&s;t moment I beheld him, pointed out the re&s;emblance; but could I think!'&mdash;and here &s;he &s;topped, overcome with &s;en|&s;ations too great for words to expre&s;s. Ambro&s;e and Eleanor, while alternately embraced by their mother, mingled tears of gratitude and affection with tho&s;e &s;he &s;hed over them. The &s;triking re&s;emblance (allowing for the difference of years) between Elea|nor and her mother, was now univer&s;ally ob&s;erved,

and every one wondered it had not before &s;truck him; yet an event &s;o far exceeding the bounds of human probability, could &s;carcely obtain credit from any, excepting Mrs. Carlton, who, being acquaint|ed with the &s;tory of her friend, entertained no doubt but that Providence had re-united her to her children. To remove every doubt, the Colonel pro|duced the letters and picture he had found in the hou&s;e of George Blake; the&s;e were immediately known by Mrs. Carlton's friend, who being &s;uffici|ently recovered, &s;atisfied the company, by relating the particulars of her hi&s;tory.

had brought up and placed with a jeweller: forgive the tear I &s;hed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">his memory; to me his affec|tion was that of the kinde&s;t brother; to my father, of the mo&s;t duteous and affectionate &s;on. Derley &s;hared with us the pittance he obtained by indu&s;try, which, joined to the little I gained from my needle, pre&s;er|ed us from the extremities of want. But greater di&s;|tre&s;s &s;oon followed; Derley, from a variety of in|cidents too tedious to relate, and &s;ome debts he had contracted on our account, was thrown into a pri|&s;on, and my father who was reduced by a long ill|ne&s;s, grew &s;o bad, that his life was de&s;paired of. Overwhelmed by this accumulated di&s;tre&s;s, I was one evening returning with &s;ome work from a &s;hop that employed me, when, in pa&s;&s;ing through a retir|ed &s;treet, I could not forbear giving vent to my tears, which in the pre&s;ence of my father I felt my|&s;elf obliged to &s;uppre&s;s; but I cannot de&s;cribe to you how much I was humbled and confu&s;ed, upon ob|&s;erving that my grief had drawn upon me the notice of a young man, who, as I afterward found, had for &s;ome time followed me. He addre&s;&s;ed me in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful terms, and enquired into the cau&s;e of my grief, adding, "Do not &s;uppo&s;e that any other motive than concern for the unfortunate prompts my curio&s;ity, perhaps I may alleviate your di&s;tre&s;s.
<PB N="172" REF="035098_0170_1000B66DD84D5810">
I replied, that my grief was not of a nature for him to alleviate, and that the only favour he could do me was to &s;uffer me to pa&s;s unnoticed. Saying this, I quickned my pace; but the &s;tranger &s;till following urged me, though in terms of great delicacy, to ac|cept his friend&s;hip, at the &s;ame time offering me his pur&s;e. Great as our di&s;tre&s;s was, I was not yet &s;ufficiently humbled to accept of pecuniary relief from a &s;tranger; nor, indeed, would prudence have permitted it: I returned the thanks due to his gene|ro&s;ity, but refu&s;ed to accept any thing, and being arrived at our own door, wi&s;hed him a good night. Upon entering, I found that an alarming change had taken place in my dear father, who &s;urvived only till the next evening. You who have hearts alive to the feelings of humanity can better imagine than I can de&s;cribe my &s;ituation: deprived of a father whom I regretted, not only as the parent who had given me birth, but as the friend who had guided my youth; Derley, my only remaining friend, ab&s;ent, langui&s;hing in a pri&s;on, unable either to con&s;ole or advi&s;e me! I was overwhelmed with the weight of the&s;e afflictions, when the unexpected entrance of Derly, for a moment, &s;u&s;pended my grief; my heart gathered &s;trength from the pre&s;ence of my be&s;t friend, and I aro&s;e to communicate, in terms of as
<PB N="173" REF="035098_0171_1000B66F81587B80">
much gentlene&s;s as my own grief would permit, the lo&s;s we had mutually &s;u&s;tained. Derley was &s;hock|ed and affected to tears; for &s;ome moments he gave vent to the emotions of his grateful heart, and then turning to me, endeavoured to give me the con&s;olation he him&s;elf wanted: at length we became more calm, and I enquired by what unexpected means he had obtained his relea&s;e? He replied that a generous &s;tranger, of who&s;e name and quality he was ignorant, had by &s;ome means gained intelligence of his mis|fortunes, paid the debt, and enclo&s;ed for him a bank|note of ten pounds. The idea of the &s;tranger who had acco&s;ted me the preceding evening, immediately ru&s;h|ed upon my mind; I communicated to Derley what had pa&s;&s;ed between us, and he agreed with me that it might be the &s;ame, though we were at a lo&s;s to conceive how he had gained the knowledge of our &s;ituation.</P>
<P>"Having performed the la&s;t melancholy duties to my dear father's remains, I began to think of look|ing out for a &s;ituation in which I might provide for my own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &s;en&s;ible that I could not long with propriety remain under the protection of Der|ley. About a week after the funeral of my father,

<PB N="174" REF="035098_0172_1000B672A4394CD8">
the generous &s;tranger introduced him&s;elf to Derley, as a friend willing to render him any father &s;ervi|ces his &s;ituation might require: I was pre&s;ent, and knowing him to be the &s;ame that had acco&s;ted me, could not do le&s;s than expre&s;s my&s;elf obliged by his civilities. Upon enquiring, we learnt that he had obtained a knowledge of our &s;ituation from the woman in who&s;e hou&s;e we lodged. From this time he called often, and his vi&s;its at la&s;t became &s;o frequent, that Derley, the watchful guardian of my youth, was alarmed, and would ab&s;olutely have forbidden them, had not the &s;tranger, fore&s;ee|ing his intentions, profe&s;&s;ed his views to be honour|able. Young and unexperienced, I too readily li&s;tened to his addre&s;&s;es, thoughtle&s;s of the ob&s;tacles that mu&s;t attend our union, for we &s;oon learnt that our benefactor was the only &s;on of the Count d'+Ore&s;ty, the Amba&s;&s;ador from France."</P>
<P>The Colonel and his pupils at this moment turned their eyes upon their venerable friend with &s;urprize and enquiry; nor was the Count him&s;elf unmoved. The mother of Eleanor and Ambro&s;e &s;topped&mdash;but the Count looking &s;ignificantly at the re&s;t, and making a &s;ign that &s;he &s;hould go on, &s;he continued. "Thoughtle&s;s of the con&s;equences,
<PB N="175" REF="035098_0173_1000A4432EC9EF90">
in&s;tead of re&s;training my inclinations, and &s;etting before M. d'Ore&s;ty the duties he owed his father, and the evils that mu&s;t attend his di&s;obedience, I li&s;tened to his addre&s;&s;es, and con&s;ented to a private marriage, fooli&s;hly amu&s;ing my&s;elf with the hope that he would find means to reconcile his father to the imprudent &s;tep he had taken. A hou&s;e was hired in a retired part of the town, and we lived together in mutual harmony; but happine&s;s was far from being our gue&s;t; the idea of the troubles in which I was &s;en&s;ible I mu&s;t involve my hu&s;band, &s;hould his father, who I now under&s;tood inherited all the pride of high birth and de&s;igned him for ano|ther, prove inflexible, continually alarmed, and made me wretched. The&s;e reflections, which I ought to have made before it had been too late, un|dermined my peace, though they did not repair my errors. A few months after our marriage, I ob|&s;erved a gloom on the countenance of my hu&s;band, and enquiring the cau&s;e, he told me that his father, having learnt that a connexion exi&s;ted between us, had declared that if it tended to marriage, he would certainly di&s;inherit him. This entirely fru&s;trated his de&s;ign of di&s;clo&s;ing his marriage, which he now thought it nece&s;&s;ary more clo&s;ely to conceal: our

re&s;idence was changed, and &s;oon after I brought into the world twins; my Eleanor and Ambro&s;e were born. More than three years elap&s;ed, and all &s;u&s;pi|cion of our union had died away when my hu&s;band one evening returned with the dreadful tidings that his father had ordered him to embark in a few weeks for France, to forward his nuptials with the daughter of the French mini&s;ter, for whom he had from his infancy been de&s;igned. I need not tell you the angui&s;h this communicated to my heart, nor was my poor d'Ore&s;ty le&s;s affected: I wept, and my hu&s;band, who well knew the inflexibility of his father, had &s;carcely a word of con&s;olation to offer me. We parted that evening without re|&s;olving upon any thing, but the next, he met me with the appearance at lea&s;t of more &s;erenity; he told me that finding it impo&s;&s;ible without the utter ruin of us all to di&s;cover his marriage to his father, he could think of no way but to embark immedi|ately for South Carolina, and &s;olicit the interfe|rence of an uncle who re&s;ided there, and who had great influence with his father. The tender age of my children made me alive to all the perils and fa|tigues they mu&s;t encounter; I repre&s;ented the&s;e to M. d'Ore&s;ty, and endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from

the voyage, e&s;pecially as I conceived the interfer|ence of his uncle might be equally as well obtained by letter; but poor d'Ore&s;ty thought otherwi&s;e; he imagined that his uncle, and every one mu&s;t &s;ee with the eyes he did, and thought the pre&s;ence of his wife and children would plead more powerfully than volumes. His fir&s;t de&s;ign was to embark with us, but the difficulty he found in di&s;engaging him&s;elf, without creating &s;u&s;picions which he wi&s;h|ed to avoid, made him relinqui&s;h the idea, and it was determined that I &s;hould embark with the chil|dren and Derley, and await his arrival at Charles-Town. Finding that his heart was &s;et upon the voyage, I &s;ubmitted, and in le&s;s than three weeks &s;et out under the conduct of Derley, with the children and a female &s;ervant, for Plymouth, from whence we were to embark with the fir&s;t fair wind.

<P>I will not attempt to de&s;cribe what I felt upon reading this letter; my angui&s;h aro&s;e to a pitch that bordered upon madne&s;s. When I ca&s;t my eyes round, and &s;aw my&s;elf &s;hut out from the po&s;&s;ibility of flying to my hu&s;band, and learnt, that had it not been for the blacke&s;t treachery, I might have arrived time enough to have taken a la&s;t farewell of him; for Blake made no &s;cruple of confe&s;&s;ing, that though I was on board when the me&s;&s;enger arrived, we had not weighed anchor, attributing what he had done to
<PB N="180" REF="035098_0178_1000B67BB8F65DF0">
the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion, as he under&s;tood from the me&s;&s;enger whom he had acco&s;ted upon the beech, that it contained an expre&s;s for me to return to London. For &s;ome hours I actually lo&s;t the u&s;e of my rea&s;on, which &s;o alarmed the wretch who per|&s;ecuted me, that he left me to the care of Derley, who in vain &s;trove to &s;oothe and reconcile me to my misfortunes. Time, however, and the tender cares of a mother, affected what argument could not; my rea&s;on returned, and the innocent prattle of my chil|dren diverted my thoughts from a calamity, the re|collection of which drove me almo&s;t to phrenzy; but I had more yet to endure. I was again per&s;ecuted by the odious addre&s;&s;es of Blake, from which Der|ley in vain endeavoured to defend me. He grew impatient, and to intreaties added threats of the mo&s;t horrid nature. Alarmed at my &s;ituation, I endea|voured to di&s;&s;emble, thinking, that when we arrived at Charles-Town, the place to which the ve&s;&s;el was bound, I &s;hould ea&s;ily rid my&s;elf of his importuni|ties. He, however, more &s;killed in artifice than I was, &s;aw through my drift, and finding that Derley would ever remain an ob&s;tacle to his views, he re|&s;olved to be rid of him at the fir&s;t opportunity: nor was this all; my innocent children became the ob|jects

of his dete&s;tation, from the &s;uppo&s;ition, I con|clude, that they kept alive in my heart the remem|brance of their father; at lea&s;t I can a&s;&s;ign no other rea&s;on for the dreadful &s;cene I am going to relate. We had been at &s;ea about &s;even weeks, when one morning as I was &s;itting with my children, one on one knee, and the other on the other, weeping, and talking with Derley on the events that were pa&s;t, Blake came into the cabin: he renewed the u&s;ual theme, mingling threats with promi&s;es, till finding I paid no attention to his di&s;cour&s;e, but &s;till wept on, and embraced my children, he &s;uddenly &s;tarted up, and &s;natching them from my arms, threw them with violence on the floor. Derley, who was attached to the children, incen&s;ed at this act of brutality, yield|ing to the impul&s;e of the moment, &s;eized him by the throat; an affront which Blake revenged by drawing a &s;hort &s;word, and &s;tabbing him, as I thought, to the heart. At the in&s;tant, five or &s;ix men came in|to the cabin, and at a &s;ignal given, &s;eized Derley, while others, notwith&s;tanding my prayers, tears, and frantic endeavours to prevent it, bore away the children. What were all my former troubles to the angui&s;h of this moment! I fancied I heard the cries of my children under the hands of their murderers,

yet was unable to fly to their re&s;cue; I endeavoured to force the door of the cabin, but finding my efforts vain, I &s;unk down in&s;en&s;ible and remember no more till I found my&s;elf on my bed, my &s;ervant &s;itting by me. I called aloud for my children, my Ambro&s;e&mdash;my Eleanor, and was in vain a&s;&s;ured that they were in &s;afety&mdash;that they were left with Derley on an i&s;land we had coa&s;ted; I gave no credit to the tale, believing it fabricated merely to amu&s;e me, e&s;peci|ally as I found my &s;ervant was in the intere&s;t of Blake. I will not trouble you with all I &s;uffered dur|ing the voyage; &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that we arrived at Charles-Town, where I hoped to e&s;cape the ty|ranny of my per&s;ecutor, but I was mi&s;taken; un|der the pretence that I was his niece, and deranged in my intellects, he conveyed me to his hou&s;e, and committed me to the care of my treacherous &s;ervant, whom he had &s;uborned to his intere&s;t. Six months I was clo&s;ely confined, but at the end of that time, through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an hone&s;t labourer who worked in grounds adjacent, I effected my e&s;cape, and having fortunately concealed about my per&s;on bank notes to the amount of a hundred and fifty pounds, engaged for my pa&s;&s;age in a ve&s;&s;el that was on the point of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ailing for England.</P>

"You will, perhaps, think that my fir&s;t &s;tep ought to have been that of communicating my &s;tory to the magi&s;trates of the town, and claiming their protecti|on; but if you knew what I had &s;uffered, how much my &s;pirits were depre&s;&s;ed, and what rea&s;on I had to dread the machinations of the wretch by whom I was per&s;ecuted, you will cea&s;e to wonder at my conduct. My &s;ole object was to return to England, either to meet my hu&s;band, (which &s;eemed within the bounds of po&s;&s;ibility) or to die there in ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>With the&s;e ideas I embarked; but on my arrival &s;oon learnt, as I had rea&s;on to pre&s;age, that my hu&s;|band was no more. He expired, as far as I could judge from the vague information I collected, a few hours after the me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched to me; e|ven before the arrival of his father, who &s;et off for Bath on the morning on which the duel was fought. I learnt al&s;o, that the Count d'Ore&s;ty, in con&s;e|quence of his affliction, had &s;olicited his recall, and had returned to France a few weeks after the death of his &s;on.</P>
<P>"All my hopes of happine&s;s were now at an end, and I re&s;olved, in &s;ome quiet family, to &s;eek an hum|ble e&s;tabli&s;hment, where I could perform the duties of my &s;tation, and prepare for the quitting of a world

The per&s;on at who&s;e hou&s;e I lodged, under&s;tanding my intention, mentioned a lady, who &s;he &s;aid was on the point of retiring into the country, and wanted a per&s;on capable of being a companion, and at the &s;ame time of a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the management of her fa|mily. Need I &s;ay that it was my dear Mrs. Carlton? I was introduced to her and immediately engaged. In due time I related to her my unhappy &s;tory, and experienced her generous &s;ympathy: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;he treated me with the affection of a &s;i&s;ter, and could I have for|gotten my children&mdash;my hu&s;band&mdash;my friend&mdash;torn from me by the mo&s;t perver&s;e and cruel de&s;tiny, I might have been happy. She pre&s;&s;ed me to make my&s;elf known to the family of my hu&s;band, offered me money for the purpo&s;e, nay would have accom|panied me to France; but I declined her generous offers; I knew not whether the father of my hu&s;|band was acquainted with his indi&s;cretions, and as I had not children to prompt my ambition, or to call forth my exertions, I wi&s;hed not to fully his me|mory with the revival of follies which originated on|ly in his too great partiality for me. Twelve years have pa&s;&s;ed, not unprofitably away; religion has taught me to moderate both my griefs and my

<P>The Colonel, his pupils, and indeed the compa|ny in general, had been prepared by the a&s;pect and ge&s;tures of the Count; to expect &s;omething extraordi|nary; but Madam d'Ore&s;ty, ab&s;orbed in the recital of her calamities, and commanding only a &s;ide view of him from the &s;eat &s;he occupied, heard this declara|tion with inexpre&s;&s;ible wonder. She viewed the Count a moment in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment: but &s;oon recollecting the character in which &s;he &s;tood before him, &s;he covered her face with her hands, and bend|ing forward, &s;eemed to await the reproaches &s;he con&s;idered due to her from the father of her hu&s;|band.</P>

The Count was affected by this intere&s;ting atti|tude, too expre&s;&s;ive to be mi&s;under&s;tood, and tak|ing her hand, a&s;&s;ured her he &s;hould henceforth con&s;ider her not only as the widow of his &s;on, but as the daughter of his affection.

The Reader need not be told that the Co|lonel and his family were the gue&s;ts of the Count d'Ore&s;ty; during three months which their vi&s;it con|tinued, he &s;pared no polite and friendly attention to render it agreeable; they made an excur&s;ion to Pa|ris, from which the Count's &s;eat was a few leagues di&s;tant, and were gratified with the view of every thing that celebrated city contained de&s;erving the at|tention of the curious. They vi&s;ited the Louvre, the Thuilleries, the Palace of Orleans, celebrated for its valuable collection of paintings, and the Gobe|lines, a famous manufactory of tape&s;try, which takes its name from one Goblie, a noted dyer of Reims, who lived in the reign of Francis the Fir&s;t.

Ambro&s;e and Eleanor were intere&s;ted in every thing they &s;aw; the perfection to which the arts had ari&s;en &s;truck them with wonder and delight; for though ac|quainted with the principles of each, they had form|ed no idea of the powerful effects produced by them when applied by genius and indu&s;try: in the mean while, they conciliated the affection of heir mother and grandfather by a thou&s;and in&s;tances of their do|cility and the goodne&s;s of their hearts; the Count became daily more attached to them, and they in return omitted nothing that might expre&s;s their gra|titude and affection. After three months &s;pent in the plea&s;ures of &s;ocial intercour&s;e, the Colonel prepared to return with his family to England, when an un|expected event retarded his departure, and plunged every one in the deepe&s;t &s;orrow. This was the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th of the Count d'Ore&s;ty, who was &s;eized with a complaint of which he died in three days. His lo&s;s was &s;incerely regreted by every one but e&s;pecially by Ambro&s;e and Eleanor, who had flattered them|&s;elves with long enjoying his paternal care, and &s;hew|ing by their conduct the grateful &s;en&s;e they entertain|ed of his kindne&s;s. Nor was Madam d'Ore&s;ty le&s;s affected: &s;he regreted him with all the warmth of gratitude and friend&s;hip his generous conduct toward

her and her children merited; indeed his attachment to them was manife&s;ted to the la&s;t act of his life; for being alarmed at the &s;ymptoms of his di&s;order, he &s;ent for a notary and in the pre&s;ence of the Colonel and Mrs. Carlton made his will, in which he nomi|nated Ambro&s;e his&punc; heir, and provided amply for Eleanor and her mother: but this acqui&s;ition of in|dependence, far from mitigating, encrea&s;ed the grief they felt for the lo&s;s of their friend, by adding ano|ther to the proofs they had already received of his friend&s;hip and affection.</P>
<P>As the Colonel was nominated executor to the Count's will, as al&s;o guardian to Eleanor and Am|bro&s;e, his pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary to arrange their affairs: he remained, therefore, &s;ome time longer in France, till having &s;ettled every thing to his &s;a|tisfaction, he embarked for England, accompanied by Madam d'Ore&s;ty and his pupils, who joyfully accepted the invitation he gave of pa&s;&s;ing the en|&s;uing Winter in England&punc; after a plea&s;ant voyage they arrived; and in the &s;ociety of their friends be|gan to re&s;ume their wonted chearfulne&s;s, when an event the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and unexpected turned all their joy to the bittere&s;t angui&s;h. The Reader mu&s;t recollect that Sir&punc; James Corpley had &s;ent the pri|&s;oners
<PB N="191" REF="035098_0189_1000A4571E1B2F10">
taken at St. Verrado to the Governor of the Spani&s;h i&s;land St. Domingo, with an account of the expedition, and his rea&s;ons for undertaking it: the&s;e rea&s;ons, however, did not &s;atisfy the Court of Spain; the de&s;truction of the Colony was con|&s;trued into an infringement upon the rights of the Spani&s;h Crown, and remon&s;trances made to the Briti&s;h Cabinet. The inhabitants of St. Verrado were in vain repre&s;ented as a banditti, to who&s;e depredations all Europe was &s;ubject; the honour of the Spani&s;h Court was thought to be concerned, and &s;atisfaction demanded. In &s;hort, after various negotiations between the Courts, it was at la&s;t &s;ettled to puni&s;h the aggre&s;&s;ors, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Sir James Corpley and the Colonel, with exile. This was an unexpected &s;troke: the joy which had for &s;ome months before enlivened the man&s;ion of the Colo|nel was no more. Eleanor wept; Ambro&s;e in|veighed loudly again&s;t the &s;entence, which, not|with&s;tanding the repre&s;entations of the Colonel, he could not help thinking unju&s;t, and both declared they would follow their protector to the end of the earth. Madam d'Ore&s;ty &s;aid the &s;ame to her friend Mrs. Carlton, who felt rather on her hu&s;bands, than her own account, ob&s;erving that it was of lit|tle importance what country &s;he inhabited, if &s;he

had the &s;ociety of her hu&s;band, &s;on, and friend. "Ah," &s;aid Eleanor, "would to Heaven we were all together in our i&s;le!" This exclamation, utter|ed without de&s;ign, gave birth to an idea in the mind of the Colonel, which &s;oon became the fa|vourite topic of conver&s;ation: this was no other than the founding of a coloney in the i&s;land which had &s;o long &s;erved him and his pupils as a retreat. He mentioned it to Sir James Corpley who imme|diately entered into it, and pointed out the proba|bility of Government approving and encouraging &s;uch a plan; in &s;hort, they united their intere&s;ts, obtained the permi&s;&s;ion and encouragement they de|&s;ired, and began to arrange every thing for the founding of a new colony. Madam d'Ore&s;ty and her children &s;till expre&s;&s;ing their re&s;olution of join|ing their fate with that of their friends, the Colonel thought proper to &s;et before them the advantages they would forego by quitting a civilized country, where every enjoyment affluence could purcha&s;e awaited them, for one unfrequented, in which they mu&s;t wait &s;ome years, at lea&s;t, even for the con|veniences of life; he &s;aid all that the mo&s;t generous and di&s;intere&s;ted mind could dictate upon the &s;ub|ject, but Madam d'Ore&s;ty, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy

of Ambro&s;e and Eleanor, declared, that as it co|incided with the inclinations of her children, her re&s;olution was fixed, and that &s;he had no higher ambition than to live and die with her friend.</P>
<P>In about &s;ix months all was ready for their de|parture, and Sir James Corpley, the Colonel, Mrs. Carlton, Charles, Madam d'Ore&s;ty, her children, the worthy Mr. Millar, and hone&s;t Peter, embark|ed at Port&s;mouth, with about &s;ix hundred per&s;ons, men and women, who willingly followed as &s;ett|lers in the new Government. The voyage was fa|vourable; after a few weeks &s;ail they drew near the Antillis, and Ambro&s;e and Eleanor began to &s;earch with wi&s;hful eyes for the i&s;land which had been the a&s;ylum of their youth: at length, the ve&s;|&s;el directing its cour&s;e ea&s;tward of Jamaica, they di&s;cerned from far the point of a rock which &s;eem|ed familiar to them: the ve&s;&s;el approches: it is the &s;ame; it is their beloved i&s;le. They behold the melancholy ve&s;tiges of the fore&s;t de&s;troyed by the conflagration; the &s;hore where they had fabricated the little bark in which alone and unprotected they had tempted the dangers of the &s;ea: they land, and feel a thou&s;and plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations on finding them|&s;elves again in an i&s;land in which, though they had

experienced &s;ome painful moments, they had pa&s;|&s;ed years of peace and tranquility. Every &s;pot is vi&s;ited; the place where their cabin &s;tood; the ca|vern in which Derley expired; the grot where ho|ne&s;t Peter was pre&s;erved; nor will it be a&s;ked if they vi&s;ited the little mount covered with myrrh trees; they are already with their mother at the foot of the monument erected with their own hands to the memory of Derley, &s;hedding with her the tear of gratitude and affection.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time the ground is cleared, and broken up; buildings ari&s;e; fortifications, even a port i&s;&s;ues from the hands of the new coloni&s;ts, and in le&s;s than four years they had &s;helter, cultivated fields, in a word, all the conveniences of life. Sir James Corpley and the Colonel, who were nominated joint Governors, in conjunction formed a code of laws, which were tendered to, and univer&s;ally approved by the people; they governed the Colony with that ju&s;|tice and moderation which formed the ba&s;is of their character; and the &s;ame of their wi&s;dom, and of the happine&s;s enjoyed under their admini&s;tration &s;oon reaching England, they had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the new Colony daily encrea&s;e, and at length become one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing; it was called the <HI>I&s;le of

Not long after the arrival of the new Coloni&s;ts, &s;ome Carribes, according to their u&s;ual cu&s;tom, landed on the i&s;land; at the &s;ight of the Europeans they em|barked precipitately in their canoes, but the Colonel wi&s;hing to put &s;ome que&s;tions to them, ordered &s;eve|ral to be detained: the account they gave of their ex|pedition into the i&s;land; once in three years, was nearly the &s;ame as that given by Peter: but they added, they often &s;tayed &s;everal days in the i&s;land, during which they planted maize and other grain, in the hope of finding it multiplied at their next vi&s;it. This &s;ingular cu&s;tom explained to the Colonel what he had till now con&s;idered as a my&s;tery, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the finding, on his fir&s;t arrival in the i&s;land, entire plains of maize and a variety of vegetable productions, which required the pains of culture, and con&s;equent|ly not to be expected in an uninhabited land: but to return. A few years after their arrival in the i&s;land, the Colonel and Mrs. Carlton had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing their &s;on Charles united to Eleanor; and &s;oon after Ambro&s;e made choice of a young lady, the niece of Sir James Corpley, univer&s;ally e&s;teemed for her amiable di&s;po&s;ition and per&s;onal accompli&s;h|ments. Hone&s;t Peter enjoyed the tranquility his

years required and his &s;ervices merited; he died at an advanced age, a few years after their arrival in the i&s;land, and was buried at the &s;ide of Derley, to who&s;e memory a &s;uperb monument was erected. The worthy Mr. Millar lived univer&s;ally re&s;pected, and by his virtues did honour to the religion he pro|fe&s;&s;ed and maintained in the Colony. Madam d'Ore&s;ty and her friend Mrs. Carlton had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing their friend&s;hip perpetuated in their children, who, by their conduct, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ily rendered them&s;elves more worthy their affection. In &s;hort, all the&s;e wor|thy characters in this delightful retreat enjoyed the tranquility which is the re&s;ult only of virtue.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;e and Eleanor through life entertained for their preceptor that tender re&s;pect and gratitude his conduct toward them ju&s;tly merited, and their hearts were &s;o well formed to pay: they looked up to him as to the parent who had fo&s;tered and to the friend who had guided their youth, ever bearing in remem|brance, that the happine&s;s they enjoyed in &s;ociety was the fruit of tho&s;e precepts they had imbibed from him in &s;olitude.</P>

<BYLINE>By Mi&s;s HELEN MARIA WILLIAMS.</BYLINE>
<P>A FRIEND of mine who is lately gone to Toulou&s;e, has &s;ent me from thence an account of &s;ome circum&s;tances which happened not long ago in that part of France, and which, &s;he &s;ays, are &s;till much the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation.

Yet, af|ter all, nothing is &s;o affecting as &s;implicity, and nothing &s;o forcible as truth. I &s;hall therefore &s;end

In &s;ome parts of the narrative you will meet with a little ro|mance; but perhaps you will wonder that you meet with no more; &s;ince the &s;cene is not in the cold phi|lo&s;ophic climate of England, but in the warm regi|ons of the &s;outh of France, where the imagination is elevated, where the pa&s;&s;ions acquire extraordinary energy, and where the fire of poetry fla&s;hed from the harps of the Troubadours, amid the &s;ullen gloom of the Gothic ages.</P>
<P>A young Frenchman, who&s;e u&s;ual re&s;idence was at Paris, having travelled as far as Toulou&s;e the year before the revolution, was invited by a party of his friends to accompany them to Bareges, where &s;ome of them were going in pur&s;uit of amu&s;ement, and others in &s;earch of health from the medical &s;prings which ri&s;e &s;o plentifully, both in hot and cold &s;treams, among the Pyrenean mountains.</P>

<P>Bareges was crouded, as it u&s;ually is in the &s;ea|&s;on, not only with French company, but al&s;o with &s;trangers, who travel from other countries, in order to u&s;e its celebrated baths. The company amu&s;ed them&s;elves, as they generally do at water-drinking places, by &s;auntering, lounging, cards, lotteries, jeux-d'e&s;prit, and &s;candal.</P>
<P>Bareges is a very expen&s;ive place. Even mode|rate accommodations mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed at a high
<PB N="200" REF="035098_0198_1000A484AB176AF8">
rate; and provi&s;ions, as well as lodgings, are &s;ome|times obtained with difficulty. Bareges is therefore &s;eldom re&s;orted to by any but people of con&s;iderable fortune, who can afford to level the ob&s;tacles which mountains interpo&s;e to their conveniences and com|forts, by the all &s;ubduing force of gold.</P>
<P>Among a number of per&s;ons of rank and fortune, there was however, one family at Bareges in a differ|ent &s;ituation. This family con&s;i&s;ted of an elderly in|firm French officer, who had long been afflicted with the pal&s;y, and his daughter, a young woman about nineteen years of age. Their appearance and mode of living &s;eemed to indicate, that, though in &s;earch of relief this old officer had journed to Bareges, he had in &s;o doing far exceeded the bounds of econo|my which his circum&s;tances pre&s;cribed, and was forced to deny him&s;elf every accommodation his in|firmities could &s;pare. He lived in the mo&s;t retired manner, in the wor&s;t lodging at Bareges;&mdash;and while the other ladies were dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;tyle of ex|pen&s;ive variety and profu&s;ion, his daughter wore on|ly a plain linen gown, which though always per|fectly clean, was coar&s;e; and her dark hair was left unpowdered, and without any ornament whatever. Fortunately for Madelaine, however (for that was
<PB N="201" REF="035098_0199_1000A487EA6155B0">
her name) her per&s;on was calculated to make her coar&s;e gown appear to the be&s;t advantage; and though &s;he was not very beautiful, her countenance had an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;weetne&s;s which an&s;wered the end of beauty by exciting love and admiration.</P>
<P>The company at Bareges &s;oon became acquainted with each other, and the ladies always took notice of Madelaine when they met her in their walks, which however, did not happen very often, for her father was frequently unable to go out. When he did he was &s;upported on one &s;ide by Madelaine, and on the other by his &s;ervant. It was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee with in&s;en&s;ibility, the attention which this intere&s;t|ing young woman paid her father, whom &s;he never quitted one moment. It was remarked with what careful tenderne&s;s &s;he u&s;ed to lead him along the &s;treets of Bareges, walking the &s;lowe&s;t pace &s;he could, and watching his &s;teps as he moved feebly on. And when he was not able to venture out, &s;he was &s;een at the window of their little parlour reading, in order to entertain him.&mdash;Her looks and manner announced that her di&s;po&s;ition was naturally &s;prightly, and that &s;he would have been gay, if her father had not been &s;ick. But all the cheerfulne&s;s &s;he could a&s;&s;ume while he &s;uffered, was exerted to amu&s;e him, and &s;horten the tedious hours of languor and debility.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="035098_0200_1000A475AB28E3A0">
Though Madelaine was hand&s;ome, the ob&s;curity and &s;eclu&s;ion in which &s;he lived pre&s;erved her from the envy of the women.&mdash;They knew well enough, that the gentlemen at Bareges were, for the mo&s;t part, men of the world, who though they may ad|mire beauty, and approve of virtue, are never &s;o far the dupes of any tender or moral &s;entiment as to let it interfere either with their vanity, their ambition, or their intere&s;t. Although the French revolution had not yet happened, the&s;e ladies were aware that with re&s;pect to marriage, the age of <HI>calculators</HI> was already come, and therefore no rival was to be feared in Madelaine. The ladies joined with the men in admiting the grace of her per&s;on, and amia|ble qualities which her conduct di&s;played. Made|laine, in &s;hort, became the object of general e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Augu&s;te, for &s;o I &s;hall call our young Pari&s;ian, who has lo&s;t his title &s;ince the laws of equality have been e&s;tabli&s;hed in his country&mdash;Augu&s;te &s;poke le&s;s of Madelaine than the other gentlemen at Bareges; but it was perhaps becau&s;e he thought of her more. Sometimes in his &s;olitary morning rambles he u&s;ed to make compari&s;ons between her and the Pari&s;ian ladies, among whom he had pa&s;&s;ed the winter, and the compari&s;on generally ended with a deep
<PB N="203" REF="035098_0201_1000A48B5DAD0FA8">
&s;igh. The &s;cene on the&s;e meditations was certainly much in Madelaine's favour. Perhaps at Paris or Var&s;ailles, Augu&s;te might have been dazzled by the poli&s;hed graces of a fine lady rouged, powder|ed, perfumed and equipped for conque&s;t. The&s;e artificial attractions might, perhaps, have accorded well enough with clipped trees and angular walks. But Madelaine's &s;imple manners, Madelaine's na|tural &s;miles, and un&s;tudied blu&s;hes, were far more in uni&s;on with the Pyrennean mountains.</P>
<P>One evening when Augu&s;te was walking in the town of Bareges with &s;ome ladies, he &s;aw Made|laine at a little di&s;tance a&s;&s;i&s;ting, with great difficul|ty, to &s;upport her father, who appeared to be &s;eized with a fit. Augu&s;te darted like an arrow toward the &s;pot, and held up the officer till he found him&s;elf &s;omewhat recovered; and then Au|gu&s;te, with a &s;ort of gentle violence, obliged Made|laine, who was pale and trembling, to let go her father's arm, and &s;uffer him to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;er|vant in leading him home, which was but a few &s;teps farther. Augu&s;te entered the hou&s;e, where he remained till the old officer was a little revi|ved;&mdash;and, after prevailing upon Madelaine to take a few hart&s;horn drops, he retired.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="035098_0202_1000A547A28065C0">
The next morning he felt that common civility required he &s;hould pay the old officer a vi&s;it and learn how he had pa&s;&s;ed the night. It happened that Madelaine had the very &s;ame idea. "Surely," thought &s;he, "it will be very &s;trange if this young man, who was &s;o kind, &s;o careful of my father, and who made me take &s;ome hart&s;horn drops, &s;hould neglect to call and enquire after us." This idea had come acro&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> her mind &s;everal times; and &s;he was meditating upon it at her father's bed&s;ide, when Augu&s;te was announced.</P>
<P>The old officer, who had all the fini&s;hed polite|ne&s;s of his country and his profe&s;&s;ion, received him in the mo&s;t courteous manner; and though he &s;poke with &s;ome difficulty, yet he was profu&s;e in acknowledgments for the &s;ervice Augu&s;te had ren|dered him. Madelaine's thanks were few, and &s;imply expre&s;&s;ed; but the tone in which they were uttered was &s;uch that Augu&s;te felt he could have &s;a|crificed his life to have de&s;erved them.</P>
<P>The old officer &s;till continued &s;ick, and therefore Augu&s;te &s;till con&s;idered it as an indi&s;pen&s;able mark of attention to go every day, and learn the &s;tate of his health.&mdash;He al&s;o began to feel that the&s;e vi&s;its became every day more nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="205" REF="035098_0203_1000A47E852F6868">
his own happine&s;s. That happine&s;s was indeed embittered by many painful reflections. He well knew that to obtain his father the count de&mdash;'s con&s;ent to marry Madelaine, was as impo&s;&s;ible as it was for him&s;elf to conquer the pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had in&s;pired. He knew exactly the order in which his father's enquiries would run on this &s;ubject. He was aware that there were two interrogatories to be an&s;wered. The fir&s;t was&mdash;"How many thou|&s;and li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">res has &s;he a year?" And the &s;econd&mdash;"Is &s;he noble?" And nothing could be more embar|ra&s;&s;ing than that the enquiry concerning fortune, would, he was &s;ure, come fir&s;t; &s;ince that was the only article which could not be an&s;wered in a &s;a|tisfactory manner; for to Madelaine's family no objection could have been made. By the way, though the former nobility of France would not ab|&s;olutely contaminate the pure &s;treams of noble blood by an union with the daughter of a <HI>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">turier,</HI> they had always &s;ufficient genero&s;ity to abate &s;ome ge|nerations of nobility in favour of a proper equiva|lent in wealth.</P>
<P>Augu&s;te, while he was convinced of the impo&s;|&s;ibility of obtaining his father's con&s;ent to his mar|riage, did not pay Madelaine one vi&s;it the le&s;s
<PB N="206" REF="035098_0204_1000B693A5CE3130">
from that con&s;ideration; and when the u&s;ual hour of his vi&s;it arrived, he often &s;uddenly broke a chain of admirable rea&s;on on the imprudence of his attach|ment, in order to ha&s;ten to the dwelling of her he loved. In a &s;hort time he cea&s;ed all kind of rea&s;on|ing on the &s;ubject, and abandoned his heart without re&s;erve to the mo&s;t violent and unconquerable pa&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Augu&s;te made a declaration to the old officer of the &s;entiments which his daughter had in&s;pired. The old gentleman mentioned it to Madelaine, and &s;he only an&s;wered by tears, of which he perfectly under|&s;tood the meaning. When Augu&s;te explained his &s;ituation with re&s;pect to his father, the officer de|&s;ired him to think of his daughter no more. Au|gu&s;te felt that he might as well have de&s;ired him to cea&s;e to breathe. He continued his vi&s;its, and the officer was &s;oon reduced to that &s;tate of langour and debility which left him neither the power nor the wi&s;h to forbid them. His complaints increa&s;ed every day, and were attended with many alarming &s;ymptoms. The &s;ea&s;on for the water of Bareges was now pa&s;t, and all the company left the place except the old officer, who was too weak to be re|moved, and Augu&s;te, who, while Madelaine re|mained,
<PB N="207" REF="035098_0205_1000B6952EC0D388">
had no power to tear him&s;elf from the &s;pot. In a few weeks the old officer felt that his dying hour was near. Augu&s;te knelt with Made|laine at his bed&s;ide&mdash;her voice was &s;uffocated by tears: and Augu&s;te had &s;carcely power to articu|late in broken accents that he would devote his life to the happine&s;s of Madelaine. The old officer fixed his eyes with a look of tender anxiety upon his daughter, and &s;oon after expired. Madelaine mourn|ed for her father with uncontrouled affliction, nor could all the attentions of her lover di&s;pel that an|gui&s;h with which her affectionate heart lamented the lo&s;s of her parent.</P>
<P>The winter being far advanced, &s;he propo&s;ed to defer her journey to the di&s;tant province where &s;he and her father had lived, until &s;pring, and to place her&s;elf in the mean time in a convent not far from Bareges. Augu&s;te exerted all the eloquence of love to induce her to con&s;ent immediately to a private marriage. She he&s;itated at this propo&s;al; and while they were conver&s;ing together on the &s;ub|ject, the door of the room in which they were &s;it|ting was &s;uddenly thrown open, and Augu&s;te &s;aw his father the count de&mdash;enter. He had heard of the attachment which detained his &s;on at Bare|ges,
<PB N="208" REF="035098_0206_1000B69799CF0E40">
and had ha&s;tened to tear him from the &s;pot before it was too late. He upbraided his &s;on with great bitterne&s;s, and began al&s;o to upbraid Made|laine: but there was &s;omething in her looks, her &s;ilence, and her tears, which &s;tifled the terms of haughty reproach in which he was prepared to ad|dre&s;s her; and ordering his &s;on to leave the room, he de&s;ired to &s;peak to her alone. After explaining to her the ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility of her being ever united to his &s;on, and his determination to di&s;inher|it him, and leave his whole fortune to his &s;econd &s;on, if Augu&s;te &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in his attachment to her&mdash;after endeavouring to awaken her pride and her genero&s;ity, he de&s;ired to know where &s;he pro|po&s;ed going. She told him her intention of plac|ing her&s;elf immediately in the convent of&mdash;. He approved of this de&s;ign, and left her to go to his &s;on. No &s;ooner was the door of the room &s;hut, than Madelaine gave way to tho&s;e tears which &s;he had &s;carcely been able to refrain while the count was &s;peaking. She had never felt &s;o &s;en&s;ibly her orphan condition as at this moment; and the dear remembrance of her fond father was mingled with the agony of di&s;appointed love.</P>
<P>Meantime the count de&mdash;declared to his &s;on,
<PB N="209" REF="035098_0207_1000B69A1B552588">
that his only chance of ever obtaining his mi&s;tre&s;s, depended on his ab&s;olute un-conditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his commands, and that he mu&s;t in&s;tantly attend him to Paris. Augu&s;te eagerly enquired what was to become of Madelaine, and his father told him that &s;he had determined to take refuge in the con|vent of&mdash;. Augu&s;te ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to depart till he was allowed an interview with Madelaine. The count was obliged to con&s;ent; but before he &s;uffered them to meet, he obtained a promi&s;e from Madelaine not to mention to her lover any particu|lars of the conver&s;ation which had pa&s;&s;ed between her and the count.</P>
<P>Augu&s;te, in this la&s;t interview with Madelaine, atoned for the cruel di&s;dain of his father, by the mo&s;t &s;olemn and pa&s;&s;ionate a&s;&s;urances of fidelity, not to be &s;haken by time or circum&s;tance; and then, after attempting to leave the room &s;everal times, and re|turning as often, he at length tore him&s;elf away. Madelaine when &s;he &s;aw him depart, felt that every earthly hope had vani&s;hed with him.</P>
<P>She &s;et out early the next morning for the con|vent of&mdash;; but not till after &s;he had &s;at for &s;ome time weeping in the chair which Augu&s;te u&s;ed to
<PB N="210" REF="035098_0208_1000B69B9F0D5F10">
occupy. Madelaine pa&s;&s;ed the remaining part of the winter in the convent of&mdash;, during which pe|riod &s;he received frequent letters from Augu&s;te; and when &s;pring arrived, he conjured her, in&s;tead of removing to her own province, to remain a little longer in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and flattered her with hopes of being able, ere long, to fulfil tho&s;e engagements upon which all his happine&s;s depended.</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer of this year an event took place which will render that &s;ummer forever memorable. The French nation, too enlightened to bear any lon|ger tho&s;e mon&s;trous oppre&s;&s;ions which ignorance of its ju&s;t rights alone had tolerated; &s;hook off its fet|ters, and the revolution was accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Madelaine was a firm friend to the revolution, which &s;he was told had made every Frenchman free, "And if every Frenchman is free," tho't Madelaine, &s;urely every Frenchman may marry the woman he loves." It appeared to Madelaine, that, putting all political con|&s;iderations, points upon which &s;he had not much medi|tated, out of the que&s;tion, obtaining liberty of choice in marriage was alone well worth the trouble of a revolution; and &s;he was as warm a patriot from this &s;ingle idea, as if &s;he had &s;tudied the de|claration of rights made by the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;em|bly, in all its extent and con&s;equences.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="035098_0209_1000A47143F42178">
The count de&mdash;, who was informed of the corre&s;pondence between the two lovers, and who &s;aw little hopes of his &s;on's &s;ubduing a pa&s;&s;ion which this intercour&s;e of letters &s;erved to cheri&s;h, contriv|ed means to have Augu&s;te's letters intercepted at the convent. In vain Madelaine enquired with all the anxiety of tenderne&s;s for letters. In vain &s;he count|ed the hours till the return of the po&s;t days. Po&s;t after po&s;t arrived, and brought no tidings of Au|gu&s;te. Three months pa&s;&s;ed in the cruel torments of anxiety and &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and were at length &s;uc|ceeded by de&s;pair. Madelaine believed &s;he was for|gotten&mdash;forgotten by Augu&s;te! She con&s;ulted her own heart, and it &s;eemed to her impo&s;&s;ible; yet, after a &s;ilence of three months, &s;he could doubt no longer.</P>
<P>Poor Madelaine now recollected with angui&s;h, in&s;tead of plea&s;ure, that all Frenchmen were free. She would have found &s;ome &s;ad con&s;olation in be|lieving that all Frenchmen were &s;laves. It would have been &s;ome alleviation of her &s;orrows if Au|gu&s;te had been forced to abandon her; and &s;he fan|cied &s;he could have borne to lo&s;e him, if &s;he had been &s;ure that he &s;till loved her&mdash;it was lo&s;ing him by his own fault that filled her heart with pangs almo&s;t in&s;upportable.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="035098_0210_1000B69D47A01E30">
The little pittance which Madelaine, after paying her father's debts, had left for her own &s;upport, was in&s;ufficient to defray her expences as a boarder in the convent. She had already by her &s;weetne&s;s and gen|tlene&s;s, gained the affections of &s;ome of the nuns, to whom &s;he was al&s;o attached, and who ince&s;&s;antly conjured her to take the veil. "And why," &s;he &s;ometimes exclaimed, "why &s;hould I he&s;itate any longer in &s;o doing? Since Augu&s;te is lo&s;t, what have I to regret in renouncing the world? What &s;acrifice do I make; what happine&s;s do I re&s;ign?</P>
<P>Madelaine had no ties to the world, of which &s;he knew but little: but to &s;eparate her&s;elf irrecovera|bly, and for ever, from him to whom her &s;oul was devoted&mdash;to &s;ee him, to hear his voice no more&mdash;to take vows which would make it even a crime to think of him&mdash;to bani&s;h him even from her thoughts&mdash;alas! Madelaine felt like Eloi&s;a.
<Q><L>"All is not heaven's while Abelard has part,</L>
<L>"Still rebel nature holds out half my heart!"</L></Q>
Sometimes too the idea occurred that Augu&s;te might love her &s;till&mdash;"And am I then," thought Made|laine, "going to reduce my&s;elf to a &s;tate in which I &s;hall be forced to wi&s;h he was unfaithful, in order to &s;ave me from the agonies of remor&s;e!"&mdash;She
<PB N="213" REF="035098_0211_1000B6A0042854C0">
put off all thoughts of entering on her novitiate for &s;ome weeks longer&mdash;no letters arrived, and again her re&s;olution to take the veil returned. "Why," cried &s;he, "why &s;hould I &s;till continue to lament that incon&s;tant lover who thinks of me no more? Alas, did he not &s;ee the angui&s;h of my &s;oul at part|ing with him?&mdash;Does he not know the de&s;erted &s;itu|ation in which I am left?&mdash;Oh, yes! he knows I have no other refuge, no other re&s;ource than taking the veil&mdash;no doubt he wi&s;hes to hear I have done &s;o&mdash;he will find in my renunciation of the world &s;ome excu&s;e for his infidelity&mdash;Oh, heavens! will Augu&s;te hear then that I am &s;eparated from him for ever without one &s;igh?&mdash;Ah, why need I deli|berate any longer?&mdash;My trials will &s;oon be pa&s;t&mdash;I feel that my heart will break&mdash;yes, death will come to my relief&mdash;and in heaven I &s;hall find my father!"</P>
<P>Madelaine at length determined to join the holy &s;i&s;terhood of the convent. The white veil for her novitiate was prepared. The day was fixed, when, pro&s;trate with her face toward the earth, and with flow|ers &s;cattered over her, and a part of her long tre&s;&s;es cut off, &s;he was to enter upon that &s;olemn tribunal preparatory to her eternal renunciation of the world&mdash;of Augu&s;te!</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="035098_0212_1000B6A1894FD9A0">
A few days before that which was appointed for the ceremony, Madelaine was called to the parlour, where &s;he found her lover, with &s;ome of the munici|pal officers of the town, wearing their national &s;car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</P>
<P>Madelaine, at the &s;ight of Augu&s;te, with difficulty reached a chair, in which &s;he &s;ellback &s;en&s;ele&s;s; while Augu&s;te could not forbear uttering &s;ome imprecati|ons again&s;t the iron grate by which they were &s;epa|rated, and which prevented him from flying to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He, however, procured help, and Ma|delaine recovered.</P>
<P>One of the municipal officers then informed her, that they had received the day before a decree of the national a&s;&s;embly, forbidding any nuns to be profe&s;&s;ed. He added, that the municipality had already given information of this new law to the abbe&s;s, who had con&s;ented to allow Madelaine to leave the convent immediately. As he pronounced the&s;e la&s;t words, Madelaine looked at her lover.&mdash;Augu&s;te ha&s;tened to explain to her that his uncle, who loved him, and pitied his &s;ufferings, had at length, made a will, leaving him his fortune upon condition that his father con&s;ented to his marriage with Madelaine.</P>
<P>When her lover and the municipal officers departed, Madelaine retired to her apartment, to give way to
<PB N="215" REF="035098_0213_1000A48632708578">
tho&s;e delicious tears which were poured from a heart overflowing with wonder, thankfulne&s;s, and joy. When her fir&s;t emotions had &s;ub&s;ided, &s;he began to pack up her little wardrobe in preparation for leaving the convent on the following day. "I always loved the revolution," thought Madelaine, as &s;he laid a|&s;ide the white gown in which &s;he was to be mar|ried the next morning; "and this la&s;t decree is &s;urely of all others the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t&mdash;but if it had come too late!"&mdash;At this idea Madelaine took up the veil for her novitiate, which lay upon her table, and bathed it with a flood of tears.</P>
<P>The next morning, Augu&s;te and Madelaine were married in the pari&s;h church of&mdash;, and immedi|ately after the ceremony, &s;et out for Paris, where they now live, and are, I am told two of the hap|pie&s;t people, and the be&s;t patriots in France.</P>
