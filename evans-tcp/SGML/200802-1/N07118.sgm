<Q>RIGHTEOUSNESS exalteth a Nation: but Sin is a reproach to any People.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SOON after Solomon came to the Throne of I&s;rael, the Lord appeared unto him, and &s;aid, "A&s;k what I &s;hall give thee?" Solomon, de&s;irous above all earthly Things to be qualified for his high Station, re|que&s;ts neither Riches, nor Honour, nor length of Days, nor the Life of his Enemies, but rather prays for "an under&s;tanding Heart" And this Prayer "plea&s;ed the Lord." God loves to &s;ee Rulers more concerned about their Duty than about their private Intere&s;t. A benevolent, generous frame of Heart prompting them to do all the Good, in their places, that they can, is plea&s;ing to the Lord. Wherefore God heard his prayer, and gave him a wi&s;e and under&s;tand|ing heart, as he de&s;ired; and long life, riches and honor be&s;ides. <Q>God gave Solomon wi&s;|dom,
<PB N="6" REF="009065_0005_10311AD3ACEF0958">
and under&s;tanding exceeding much, and largene&s;s of heart, even as the Sand that is on the Sea-Shore: and Solomon's wi&s;dom excelled the wi&s;dom of all the Children of the ea&s;t Country, and all the wi&s;dom of E|gypt; for he was wi&s;er than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the Sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all Nations round about. And there came of all People to hear the wi&s;dom of So|lomon, from all Kings of the Earth which had heard of his wi&s;dom: and he &s;pake three thou&s;and Proverbs.</Q> &mdash; one of which was this, <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a Nation: but Sin is a re|proach to any People.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e words then come recommended to our mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;ideration, as containing one of the wi&s;e Maxims of the wi&s;e&s;t of men, a chief political principle of the greate&s;t Politician; and they furni&s;h us with a Subject proper for this Occa&s;ion. &mdash; Here then, Let us Enquire</P>
<P N="1">I. WHAT is meant by Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">II. HOW Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a Nation.</P>
<P N="3">III. HOW Sin is a Reproach to any People,</P>
<P>And then,</P>
<P N="4">IV. I will endeavour to &s;hew that the only way for us in this Colony to be a happy Com|munity is to be a righteous People.</P>
<P N="1">I. IN the fir&s;t Place, we are to Enquire, what is meant by Righteoune&s;s. And there
<PB N="7" REF="009065_0006_10311AD6A38A8A90">
is no doubt the word is de&s;igned to compri&s;e all moral Vertue in general; as it was only in this large and comprehen&s;ive Sen&s;e of the word that National Pro&s;perity and Happine&s;s were pro|mi&s;ed to Righteou&s;ne&s;s under the Jewi&s;h di&s;|pen&s;ation.&mdash; But then &s;till it may be enquired, what is the Sum of moral Vertue? and how does Righteou&s;ne&s;s naturally compri&s;e the whole?</P>
<P>TO view Beings and Things as they are, and to be affected and act accordingly is the Sum of moral Vertue. All moral Vertue is frequently, in the &s;acred writings &s;ummed up in one thing, under one comprehen&s;ive Name. For, as every moral Vertue grows up from one Root, and is therefore radically but one thing; &s;o with the greate&s;t propriety all may be called by one Name. Thus LOVE, in fact, is the whole of moral Vertue. And thus LOVE is the Name given to the whole, in that brief Summary of the divine Law given by our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. "Thou &s;halt <HI>love</HI> the Lord thy God with all thy heart:" and "thou &s;halt <HI>love</HI> thy Neighbour as thy Self." Love is radically the whole of that Duty which God requires of man. "For on the&s;e two Com|mands hang all the Law and the Prophets," Yea, Love is the Sum of all God's moral Per|fections. And of all holine&s;s in all holy Be|ings in the Univer&s;e. For the moral Law is the tran&s;cript of God's moral Perfections. The divine Nature is the original, the divine Law is an exact tran&s;cript, and in a perfect confor|mity
<PB N="8" REF="009065_0007_10311AD8290F3EE8">
to this Law con&s;i&s;ts the perfect holine&s;s of Angels and Saints in heaven, and in an imper|fect conformity to it con&s;i&s;ts the imperfect holine&s;s of Saints on Earth, and the perfect mediatorial Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is but a perfect conformity to the &s;ame Rule thro' a cour&s;e of the &s;everelt Trials. For the holine&s;s of God and Chri&s;t, of Angels and Saints in hea|ven, and of Saints on Earth, is of the &s;ame Na|ture, how different &s;oever in Degree and in Circum&s;tances. For there is but one kind of true holine&s;s in the Univer&s;e: and all con&s;i&s;ts in Love <HI>God is Love,</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> is the Sum of all that Duty which God requires of Man. &mdash; "Thou &s;hall Love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart and thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy Self." &mdash; But</P>
<P>LOVE to God and to our Neighbour &s;up|po&s;es that we view them as they are, and it con|&s;i&s;ts in our being affected accordingly, and this affection naturally excites to an an&s;werable Con|duct. &mdash; And</P>
<P>TO love God with all our hearts is only to give him his due: for he de&s;erves it at our hands. And to love our Neighbour as our &s;elves, is only to feel them as we would have them feel to us; that is, to do as we would be done by. And therefore to love God with all our hearts, and our Neighbour as our &s;elves is in its own Nature <HI>right.</HI>&mdash;He then who is thus affected toward God and his Neighbour is, in Scripture,
<PB N="9" REF="009065_0008_10311ADDC5AEDD50">
called, a <HI>righteous</HI> Man. He is <HI>rightly</HI> affected. He feels as he ought to do. His heart is <HI>right.</HI> And &s;o he is called a <HI>righteous</HI> Man. And there|fore <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is another Name u&s;ed in Scri|pture as comprehending the &s;um of all Vertue, even as the word <HI>Sin</HI> is u&s;ed to comprehend all Vice. Thus in our text, <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a Nation: but Sin is a reproach to any People.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. RIGHTEOUSNESS exalteth a Nation &mdash; as it is in it&s;elf an honourable thing &mdash; as it has a natural tendency to make a Nation pro&s;|perous and happy &mdash; and as it will be attend|ed with the &s;pecial Smiles of him, who loves Righteou&s;ne&s;s and hates Iniquity, and &s;itting at the head of the univer&s;e, can build up or pull down Nations at his Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>RIGHTEOUSNESS is in its own Nature an honourable Thing. Yea, among all the va|riety of Excellencies in the univer&s;e, there is none of equal Dignity with this. It renders God glorious, Angels lovely, and heaven a place of con&s;ummate Bli&s;s. Infinite knowlege, almighty Power, and univer&s;al Dominion ren|der the Deity great; but it is Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or the moral rectitude of his Nature, that renders him Glorious. Could we conceive an almighty Being at the head of the univer&s;e, able with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e, to accompli&s;h all his purpo&s;es, but entirely devoid of moral Rectitude, whatever rea&s;on there might be to fear and tremble be|fore him, there would be no ground for any one
<PB N="10" REF="009065_0009_10311ADF4CDEFBA0">
in the intellectual &s;y&s;tem to e&s;teem, love, and honour him. Perfect moral Rectitude is the highe&s;t Glory of the divine Nature it &s;elf. Yea, it is radically the &s;um total of all that Beauty there is in the Deity. It is this, that renders every other attribute of God Amiable, and cau&s;es the divine Being to appear Glorious in the Eyes of Angels, in whatever point of light they view him.</P>
<P>Is he Almighty, &s;o that none can re&s;i&s;t him? is he All-knowing, &s;o that none can circumvent him? is he Supreme, &s;o that none can call him to an account? and is he an ab&s;olute Sovereign, &s;o as to be entirely at liberty to conduct accor|ding to the Council of his own Will? and does his Providence extend to all things in the uni|ver&s;e? and is this a &s;ettled Maxim with him, <HI>My Council &s;hall &s;tand, and I will do all my Plea|&s;ure?</HI> Yet, as he is a Being of perfect moral Rectitude, he is not the le&s;s, but rather infinitely the more Glorious, in the Eyes of the Angelic world. They rejoice in his Almightine&s;s and infinite Wi&s;dom, they exult in his Supremacy and ab&s;olute Sovereignty, and are favi&s;hed in a view of his univer&s;al Government, becau&s;e it is ab&s;olutely perfect They cry one to another, <HI>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of ho&s;ts; the whole earth is full of his Glory.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not with the great Monarch of the univer&s;e, as it is many times with earthly Prin|ces. They often abu&s;e their Power, and their
<PB N="11" REF="009065_0010_10311AE20ADECE70">
Supremacy to mi&s;chievous Purpo&s;es. The thought, that there is none above them to call them to an Account, emboldens them to cruel and barbarous Deeds. And this, amid&s;t all their external Granduer and Glory, &s;inks their Character and renders them odious and con|temptable. All their royal Dignity loo&s;es its Lu&s;ture, while they are without that moral Rectitude, which exalts the great Monarch of the Univer&s;e above all ble&s;&s;ing and prai&s;e.&mdash; For, concerning God, it may be &s;aid, that great as his Power is, he never u&s;ed it to oppre&s;s the meane&s;t &s;ubject in his Dominions: and ab&s;olute as his Sovereignty is, he never made one unwi&s;e decree. His Law is holy, ju&s;t and good, like its Author; perfect in Beauty, without a Ble|mi&s;h; &s;weeter than honey, yea, than the honey comb: and all his Conduct towards his Crea|tures is &s;o exactly right, and good and wi&s;e, that it is ab&s;olutely above emendation. In all in|&s;tances he knows what is be&s;t to Decree, and what is be&s;t to Command, and what is be&s;t to do; and in all in&s;tances he Decrees, he Commands and he Conducts as well as he knows how. An ab&s;olutely perfect, an infinitely glorious and amiable Being! &mdash; It is true, he is accounta|ble to none; and it is equally true, there is no need of it: for he is ab&s;olutely perfect.&mdash; It is true, "he worketh all things according to the Council of his own Will;" and it is equally true, that the Council of his own Will is ab&s;o|lutely
<PB N="12" REF="009065_0011_10311AE624976E80">
perfect.&mdash; "He doth according to his Plea&s;ure in the armies of Heaven and among the inhabitants of the Earth, and none can &s;tay his hand, or &s;ay unto him, what do&s;t thou?" But then, "He is the Rock, his work is Per|fect, for all his ways are Judgment: a God of Truth and without Iniquity, ju&s;t and right is he."&mdash;It is true, "He is the high and lofty One, that inhabiteth Eternity, who&s;e Name is holy, and who dwelleth in that high and holy Place," infinitely exalted above the noble&s;t of his Creatures; yet at the &s;ame time, "he dwell&s; with the humble and contrite, to revive the &s;pirit of the humble, and the &s;pirit of the con|trite ones."&mdash;It is true, He has the care of Kingdoms and Countries, Armies and Fleets; yea, all the grand Affairs of the univer&s;e lie upon his Hands; for "his Kingdom ruleth over all:" however, he is as mindful of the Widow and the fatherle&s;s Children, who tru&s;t in him, and takes as good Care of all their Concerns, as tho' he had nothing el&s;e to do; for "the very hairs of their head are all numbered." &mdash; But if we begin to &s;peak in his Prai&s;e, we know not where to &s;top; for there is no end to the Excel|lencies of his Character. &mdash; And, 'tis Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, it is the perfect moral rectitude of his Nature, that thus exalts him, and renders him worthy of &s;o much honour and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>AND it is this, which renders the Angels, the inhabitants of Heaven &s;uch glorious Beings.
<PB N="13" REF="009065_0012_10311AE8ED7DF348">
They are like their &s;overeign King; holy, as he is holy. Their hearts are right, they feel as they ought to feel. They view all Beings and Things, &s;o far as their finite Capacities will ad|mit, as they are, and are affected and act accor|dingly. They view the Deity as the &s;um of Be|ing, of perfection, and of all Good; as their Cre|ator, and rightful Lord and Sovereign; and con&s;ider one another as fellow-creatures and fel|low-&s;ubjects: and they feel and act accordingly. And to Rejoice in God's' exaltation to exult in his ab&s;olute &s;upremacy and univer&s;al Dominion, to be charmed with the beauties of his Character and the perfection of his Conduct, to be entirely dependent on him and ab&s;olutely devoted to him, perfectly united together in Sentiments and in the mo&s;t cordial Love, render them glorious Angels and happy A&s;&s;ociates. Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or moral Rectitude is their Beauty and Glory, and what renders them &s;uch a noble and ble&s;&s;ed Community, under the Government of him, who is ab&s;olutely perfect in the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible Degree.</P>
<P>AND THIS IS HEAVEN.&mdash;And thus Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s exalts that holy Community above.&mdash; God po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Throne, not merely as being Creator and Lord of all things, but on the foot of proper Merit and Worthine&s;s. He is worthy on account of his &s;uperior Character: he is infi|nitely worthy on account of his infinitely &s;upe|rior Character to take the Throne, and reign
<PB N="14" REF="009065_0013_10311AEA9C364658">
over all for ever and ever: "for his Name alone is excellent, and his Glory is exalted above the heavens." And the Angelic Ho&s;ts, while they &s;tand before him, full humility and reverence, of love to him, of harmony among them&s;elves, all ready to do his will, are worthy to be ap|proved, and loved, and honoured by their
glo|rious Sovereign.</P>
<P>FROM Heaven, the world of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, look down to Hell, the world of Sin and Wick|edne&s;s, of di&s;cord and confu&s;ion, of pride, ma|lice, envy, and all the furious Pa&s;&s;ions, and view them in contra&s;t; and well con&s;ider their differ|ent States, &mdash; and behold &mdash; thus, Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth the one, &mdash; and thus &s;in &s;inks down the other.</P>
<P>AND if Righteou&s;ne&s;s is of &s;o honourable a Nature, as thus to exalt even God him&s;elf, no wonder the wi&s;e Man &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a Nation</HI>: If it is the very Glory of the Divinity, if it is the Beauty of Angels, if it is this chiefly which renders Heaven &s;o much better than Hell, no wonder Solomon &s;hould think it would render Kingdoms, Countries and Nati|ons on Earth Honourable and Glorious &s;hould it once prevail among them.</P>
<P>LET us &s;top here, a few Minutes, and think, what the Con&s;equences would be, &s;hould Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s which is the Glory of the Deity, and the very Beauty of Heaven, &s;hould that holy and divine Temper, which reigns there in Perfection,

de&s;cend on crowned Heads, and fill the Courts of Princes, and &s;pread down thro' every Rank, even down to the meane&s;t Cottage, and to the poore&s;t Beggar. What would the Con&s;equences be? Heaven would &s;oon begin on Earth.</P>
<P>PRINCES, even the mo&s;t haughty Monarchs of the Earth, who, to gratify their Pride and Ambition, do often now, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, &s;ummon mighty Armies, &s;pread war, deva&s;tation and ruin thro' whole Countries, would be at once turned into other men, "be Converted and become as little Children," as harmle&s;s as Doves, as meek as Lambs. Such would be their humility, their &s;elf-abhorrence, their penitence, their reverence toward the Deity and love to the human kind, that they would, &s;peedily and with the utmo&s;t &s;incerity, begin to concert mea&s;ures for a univer&s;al, perpetual Peace. Amba&s;&s;adors for that End would be &s;ent from, and to, every Monarch, Prince and Court &mdash; and Orders be &s;oon di&s;patched to Fleets and Armies to &s;top the effu&s;ion of human Blood. &mdash; The thundering Cannons would cea&s;e to roar&mdash;Peace, univer&s;al Peace be &s;oon proclaimed; for e|very Monarch, from the heart, would &s;oon begin to &s;ay, to each other, "Take your right my Bro|ther, and let me have mine, and let us live in love and peace, and &s;eek the true happine&s;s of our &s;ubjects, and no longer go on &s;acrificing thou&s;ands of precious lives, in quarrels, which hone&s;t men might &s;ettle with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e."

<P>GO to the Clergy, and view them in their Studies, or in their Pulpits, behold, they are cloathed with Righteou&s;ne&s;s, they are inflamed with every holy, pious, benevolent, heavenly affection! they love their Ma&s;ter, they love their People, they love their Work: they "de|light in the law of the Lord, and in his Law do they meditate Day and Night" They are "like Trees planted by the Rivers of Water, who&s;e leaf never falls, and which brings forth fruit in their &s;ea&s;on." And out of their "I rea|&s;ure," from time to time, they "bring forth

Yea, look thro' a Kingdom, yea, look from Kingdom to Kingdom, there are no Sects, no Parties, no Di|vi&s;ions. They all, Mini&s;ters and People, make up one great Family, united in faith and love; united in one and the &s;ame Belief, and in the mo&s;t cordial Affection to one another.&mdash;And Mini|&s;ters of choice give them&s;elves wholly to their work; and their People from their own inclina|tion unite as one to give them an honourable &s;upport, not as their burden, but as their de|light, they even take plea&s;ure in it.</P>
<P>GO to the Merchant's Shop, and you will find not only ju&s;t Weights and ju&s;t Mea&s;ures, but al&s;o piety towards God and love to the hu|man kind, diligence and indu&s;try, prudence in their calling, frugality in their expences, gene|ro&s;ity to the poor, charmingly mingled in their Characters.

<P>THOSE who are in public tru&s;t, are not on|ly under all the&s;e obligations to be religious them&s;elves; but they are all under peculiar obligations to do all they can to promote a u|niver&s;al reformation in others. &mdash; And &s;uffer me here to &s;tate and urge the&s;e obligations in an addre&s;s to our Rulers and Teachers.&mdash; And</P>

You owe this Duty to God, who has in the Cour&s;e of his Providence done you this honour, to Con&s;titute you our Rulers. He is the Fa|ther of your &s;pirits, he formed your Minds, he qualified you for Government, and has di&s;tin|gui&s;hed you from your Brethren and Neigh|bours, and rai&s;ed you up to rule over us. He has committed this People to your Care, and made them your Children, and he has given you wi&s;dom, and put the &s;word in your hands, and you are &s;worn to be faithful: and God is your Witne&s;s, &amp; will be your Judge at that Day, when dive&s;ted of your pre&s;ent offices, you ap|pear before the bar of Chri&s;t to receive your final &s;entence, in the pre&s;ence of the a&s;&s;embled univer&s;e. And if you are unfaithful you never can an&s;wer it to the Almighty; but will &s;tands at his Bar as &s;elf-condemned, as you have &s;ome times &s;een guilty Criminals &s;tand at yours.</P>
<P>HIS HONOR, the Governour, by and with your advice and de&s;ire, has lately &s;ent his MAJESTY'S Proclamation thro' the Colony, and ordered it to be read twice every year in all our Congregations.

And therein you <Q>Earne&s;tly and Strictly require all Per&s;ons within this Government, of every Charact|er rank and degree, to exert them&s;elves in the practice and encouragement of piety and virtue, and in preventing and puni&s;hing vice, profanene&s;s and immorality. And you

<P>Secondly. &mdash; TO the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;|pel here pre&s;ent.&mdash;Reverend Fathers and Bre|thren, when our Rulers are making efforts to bring about a general reformation, how ought we to be affected? And what ought to be our Conduct? Should not we be ready to look up to heaven and devoutly &s;ay, <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Almighty who hath rai&s;ed us up &s;uch a King, and hath put this thing into the hearts of our Rulers. And now may the Lord confirm the heart of our King and of our Rulers in this good work.</Q>&mdash;and in the mean time our whole Conduct &s;hould declare to our rulers and to the world, that we are with them in this thing.&mdash; Honor, our Governour, in his Proclamation, has <Q>recommended it to us, to inculcate upon our hearers, the importance of this Great and Good Work, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t by our public Mini&s;try and private Council and Advice in promoting the &s;ame.</Q>&mdash;And Now what &s;hall we &s;ay to our Great Ma&s;ter at the Day of Judgment, if we &s;hould be cold and indifferent upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion as this, and when thus Called upon? Our Saviour was Zea|lous again&s;t all manner of Wickedne&s;s at the ri&s;que of his Life. His Apo&s;tles and fir&s;t Mi|ni&s;ters were of the &s;ame Spirit; and in the

mid&s;t of mighty oppo&s;ition, went every where, preaching, that Men &s;hould repent and turn to God. And &s;hall we be lukewarm with the&s;e examples before us? And that when we have &s;o many things to animate us from Heaven and Earth? God Forbid.&mdash; Wherefore let us upon this occa&s;ion afre&s;h devote our &s;elves wholly to the work of the Mini&s;try, and be agreed and united to do our utmo&s;t to bring about a uni|ver&s;al reformation.</P>
<P>AND behold, how good and how plea&s;ant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! And if we &s;hould all Cordially unite in preach|ing up the true Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and in bearing te&s;timony again&s;t error and wickedne&s;s of every kind; and if we &s;hould all be thoro'ly engaged to maintain the di&s;cipline of Chri&s;t in his hou&s;e, and to prevent the unqualified from entering into the work of the Mini&s;try, and to &s;trengthen the hands of our Civil Authority in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing vice: If Rulers and Teachers thro|out the Colony, &s;hould be united as one man to bring about a univer&s;al reformation, might we not hope for the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing and expect to &s;ee true religion yet prevail in our land; a land originally &s;ettled for religious purpo&s;es; a land under many &s;ingular obligations to be holy to the Lord?&mdash;May God Almighty give us &s;uch an heart of his infinite Mercy through Je&s;sus Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="009065_0040_10311B376D90AC40">TO Conclude, with one word to the Con|gregation in general.&mdash; From all that has been &s;aid, the true Source of all our woes in this Colony may ea&s;ily be di&s;cerned, and the only way for a Cure. <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation; but Sin is a reproach to any people.</HI></P>
<P>AND if we look back to the beginning of the World, the experience of all pa&s;t ages &s;erves to Confirm us in the&s;e Sentiments. &mdash; How happy was Man at fir&s;t, when Sin was a thing unknown; And had mankind remained in their primitive &s;tate of innocence and recti|tude, in love to God and one another, Mi&s;ery had been for ever unknown, and this had been a happy World, near akin to Heaven. Sin is the &s;ource of all that mi&s;ery and ruin which has &s;pread thro' this apo&s;tate race. It turned our fir&s;t parents out of paradi&s;e, and &s;ubject|ed them and all their race to Death. It bro't down a flood on the old world, and fire and brim&s;tone on Sodom, and all the plagues on Egypt. It cau&s;ed the Carca&s;es of &s;ix hundred Thou&s;and I&s;raelites to fall in the Wilderne&s;s, and was the &s;ource of all the Judgments which came on God's peculiar People in the days of their Judges and of their Kings. It laid a foundation for their babyloni&s;h Captivity, and afterwads for their de&s;truction by the Romans,
<PB N="42" REF="009065_0041_10311B39556DDED0">
Mean while, it has &s;pread Mi&s;ery and Ruin among all other Nations upon the face of the whole Earth from age to age. &mdash; And this dreadful Mon&s;ter, this fir&s;t born of Satan, this univer&s;al de&s;troyer, which we Call <HI>Sin,</HI> has en|tred into this Colony! nay, has entered into our hearts, and is the &s;ource of all our Calami|ties, Civil, Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and Dome&s;tic. &mdash; And &s;hall we hug the viper in our Bo&s;oms, and Care&s;s the &s;ource of all our woes! God forbid.&mdash;Rather having found out the hateful Mon&s;ter, let us with a holy indignation bring it out before the Lord, and treat it as <HI>Samuel</HI> did <HI>Agag.</HI>&mdash;This is the <HI>Achan,</HI> this is the trou|bler of our I&s;rael, wherefore by a univer&s;al A|greement let it be doomed to Death.

Pride, Luxuriou&s;ne&s;s, Con|tentiou&s;ne&s;s, Malice, Envy, Idlene&s;s, Di&s;ho|ne&s;ty, or by whatever other name it is Called, it is <HI>Sin,</HI> and let it die. And let Righteo&s;|ne&s;s Come and reign in its &s;tead.

repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of Sins. Therefore in his Name let us look up to God, and Cry mightily for deliverance. &mdash; And may heaven hear our Cry, and &s;end us help, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to whom be Glory for ever and ever. Amen.</P>
