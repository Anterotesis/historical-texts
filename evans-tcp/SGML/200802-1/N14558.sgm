<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE advantages of a publication of this kind to the practitioner in medicine, are 'tis pre&s;umed, too obvious to need enumeration; I &s;hall, therefore, only premi&s;e a few nece&s;&s;ary ob&s;ervations relative to the work it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="1">I. The do&s;es of medicines &amp;c. are &s;et down as for adults; and therefore, the pre&s;criber will ea&s;ily vary them for other ages. For example, children of two years old may, in general, take about a third part of the do&s;es for adults; or a little more; and &s;o in proportion for other ages, the con&s;titution being al&s;o con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="2">II. Where it could conveniently be done, I have mentioned the intervals at which the medicines are to be repeated: but the&s;e may be varied at the pre&s;criber's di&s;cretion. For brevity's &s;ake I have in many places, u&s;ed the word frequently; by which I would have it under&s;tood, that every three, four, &s;ix, eight, &amp;c. hours are meant, according to the exigency of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="vii" REF="018456_0005_0FA76D0DF33223E0">III. When any particular indication is to be an&s;wered, the cla&s;&s;es, as cathartics, diuretics, a&s;tringents &amp;c. may be referred to; under which heads, as many of the compo&s;itions and &s;imples as were judged nece&s;&s;ary, are arranged.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The limits a&s;&s;igned to the work would not admit of formulae; nor do I think them by any means nece&s;&s;ary. The do&s;es of all the articles u&s;ually admini&s;tered are &s;et down; and I will not &s;uppo&s;e, that there is any medical practitioner, who cannot give directions for making them into draughts, bolu&s;es, or other forms that may be required. The vehicles &s;hould be either perfectly innocent, as pure water, &s;imple &s;yrup &amp;c. or of &s;imilar virtues with the medicines to be given. And if two articles of the &s;ame virtues, cathartics for example, are employed, it &s;carce need be mentioned, that the do&s;e of each mu&s;t be proportionably le&s;s. It may be added, that ingre|dients of a volatile nature &s;hould be given in a liquid form, le&s;t their virtues exhale; very nau|&s;eous ones &s;hould, if convenient, be given in the form of pills or bolu&s;es.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="viii" REF="018456_0006_0FA76D0E8932DBC0">V. In the alphabet I have, for the mo&s;t part, made u&s;e of Engli&s;h names; or at lea&s;t have referred from tho&s;e where technical terms are employed.</P>
<P>This work was drawn up originally for my own u&s;e, and in the cour&s;e of practice, I have found it very convenient to refer to occa&s;ionally. It was the opinion of tho&s;e medical Gentlemen who &s;aw the Manu&s;cript that it would be equally u&s;eful to others, and this was my motive for mak|ing it public.</P>
<P>If this work a&s;&s;i&s;t the practitioner's memory in matters already known, at lea&s;t till he has lei&s;ure to con&s;ult larger works, where nece&s;&s;ary, my de&s;ign is an&s;wered.</P>

If a plethora be indicated, bleed; if otherwi&s;e avoid it; bli&s;ters, laxatives, and emollient cly&s;ters, if nothing forbid, the nervous and anti&s;pa&s;modic medicines, as a&s;&s;afoetida, ca&s;tor, camphire, mu&s;k, volatile &s;alts, with opium, if nece&s;&s;ary. If the bowels are convul&s;ed, opium may be added to the cly&s;ters al&s;o. The parts may be rubbed externally with bal&s;. anod. and lin. vol. or other warm anodyne embrocation: free air &s;hould be allowed to the patient.</P>
<P>In children, this complaint often proceeds from an acid in the primae viae; magne&s;ia is then proper. Worms may al&s;o occa&s;ion it, anthelmintics are in this ca&s;e to be given; bli&s;ters, and anodynes, given with caution, are good.</P>

<P>TREATMENT.

<HEAD>DROPSY.</HEAD>
<P>SYMPTOMS. A collection of water or &s;erum in &s;ome part of the body. Before the di&s;order is perfectly formed it is called Cachexy; when the lymph is accumulated in the cellular membrane it is called Ana&s;arca, or Leacophlegmatia; when there is a collection of water in the abdomen, it is termed A&s;cites; if in the brain, Hydrocephalus; if in the brea&s;t, Hydrops pectoris; if in the womb, Hydrop. Uteri; and if in the &s;crotum, Hydrocele.</P>
<P>In common drop&s;ies the legs u&s;ually &s;well, and a dent or pit remains for &s;ome time after pre&s;&s;ing the fle&s;h with the finger: the
<PB N="26" REF="018456_0024_0FA76E5C36554570">
appetite abates; the face either bloats or becomes thin and pale; little urine is made; thir&s;t, &s;low fever, &s;hortne&s;s of breath, la&s;|&s;itude and heavine&s;s; the&s;e &s;ymptoms obtain e&s;pecially in the ana&s;arca and a&s;cites. In the hydrocephalus, convul&s;ions, &s;quint|ing, &s;hunning the light, opening of the &s;utures, and vomiting of bile, commonly attend, e&s;pecially if the di&s;ea&s;e be far advanced.</P>
<P>TREATMENT In the Ana&s;arca and A&s;cites, purges with Jalap, &s;cammony, calomel, gamboge, elaterium, or the like, twice or thrice a week. Tinct. cupri, tinct. cantharid. &s;al diuretic. or &s;al ab&s;inth. with bitter infu&s;ion. Emetics and &s;udorifics, bli&s;ters and &s;carifications, pre&s;cribed with due caution, have often good effect, otherwi&s;e, they may do harm. Bark may be given if the &s;trength flag, or con&s;umptive &s;ymptoms appear. Weak liquids of all kinds u&s;ed to be avoided, but are now allowed freely with &s;ucce&s;s, e&s;pecially after the dra&s;tic purges. In this complaint bread is generally ordered to be toa&s;ted, and fle&s;h to be baked, roa&s;ted, or broiled. Smoking is of great u&s;e, and mu&s;tard &s;eeds taken whole have often good effect.</P>
<P>If the di&s;order ari&s;eth from the too copious u&s;e of weak liquids, or ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, &s;udorifics are much to be depended upon. If from drunkenne&s;s, riding on hor&s;eback and the u&s;e of wine, or rather geneva diluted with water, in moderate quantity, will be u&s;eful. If from a con&s;umptive tendency, diuretics, joined with corroborants. If after great lo&s;s of blood, or from tedious fevers, cathartics &s;hould not be u&s;ed too freely, but chalybeate bitters &s;hould be chiefly relied on. In the A&s;cites, tapping mu&s;t be performed, if the methods above recommended fail.</P>
<P>In Drop&s;y of the brea&s;t, diuretics are chiefly to be employed, cathar|tics only occa&s;ionally. Bli&s;ters applied below the brea&s;t, and even on the thighs or legs and kept open, are al&s;o very effectual.</P>
<P>In the Hydrocephalus internus, a &s;alivation excited by mercury has of late been recommended; purges may be given, and medicines of the carminative and anti&s;pa&s;modic kind. Bli&s;ters, &s;etons, and i&s;&s;ues &s;hould al&s;o be pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>In the Drop&s;y of the womb, emetics, &s;timulating cly&s;ters, and occa&s;ionally cathartics; diuretic, attenuant, and re&s;olvent medicines &s;hould be given; and fomentations and vapour baths advi&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the Hydrocele, let out the water with the trochar at the bottom part of the &s;crotum; but when water is contained in the cellular membrane, treat it as an Ana&s;arca.</P>

<P>It is of more con&s;equence here to de&s;cribe the &s;ymptoms in the dog than tho&s;e of the patient. We may know the dog to be mad by
<PB N="40" REF="018456_0038_0FA76E6B46CE62C8">
his dull heavy look, endeavouring to hide him&s;elf; &s;eldom or ever barking; angry and &s;narls at &s;trangers, but fawns on his owner; refu&s;es all food, droops, hangs down his ears and tail, and often lays down as if going to &s;leep; this is the fir&s;t &s;tage.</P>
<P>He now begins to breathe quick and heavy, &s;hoots out his tongue, &s;lavers, and froths at the mouth; looks half a&s;leep; flies &s;ud|denly at by&s;tanders; runs forward in a curve line; at length he knows not his owner, his eyes become thick and dim, and water runs from them; tongue of a lead colour; grows weak and faint; often falls down, then ri&s;es; and attempts to fly at &s;ome|thing; grows mad and furious; the nearer to this &s;tate, the more dangerous the bite.</P>
<P>If the &s;tate of the dog cannot be obtained, he may be known to have been mad, or the di&s;order may be known to be this by the following effects, which will come on &s;ooner or later: The bitten part begins to be painful, wandering pains comes on gradually, with heavine&s;s and unea&s;ine&s;s; di&s;turbed &s;leep, frightful dreams, &s;tartings, &s;pa&s;ms, &s;ighing, anxiety, love of &s;olitude, pains &s;hoot from the bitten part up to the throat, with &s;traightne&s;s, &s;en&s;ation of choaking, and horror or dread at &s;ight of water or other liquids, which is a &s;ufficient characteri&s;tic of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>TREATMENT. Cut out the bitten part immediately, which is the only certain cure: cupping-gla&s;&s;es &s;hould then be applied; cauterize and wa&s;h it daily with &s;alt water, or ung. caerul fort, keeping it open with e&s;carotics; bleed, if the ve&s;&s;els be full; vomit with merc. emet. flav. give mo&s;ch. to xvi. gr. cinnabar half a &s;cruple (to which camphire and pil. &s;apon. to vii. gr. may be added) at night, and a purge the next morning; bathe in the &s;ea, or cold bath, and give a &s;udorific; repeat the&s;e for a week daily, and three or four times at the next full and change of the moon.</P>
<P>Ung. caerul. mit. applied externally, and turbith mineral given inwardly, &s;o as to rai&s;e a &s;alivation for &s;everal weeks, are &s;aid to be efficacious, The u&s;ual remedy known is now the Orm&s;kirk medicine, but this has failed in a variety of ca&s;es.</P>

May be known from a mere &s;yncope by the pul&s;e and breathing continuing, whereas in a &s;yncope they are not perceptible; it al&s;o comes on gradually, but a &s;yncope more &s;uddenly; in that, the fit is of &s;hort continuance, in this, u&s;ually much longer: with a colour in the face, which is not the ca&s;e in a &s;yncope.</P>
<P>TREATMENT of the di&s;order it&s;elf, as in the hypochondria&s;is. In the fit volatile foetids, &s;inged feathers, &amp;c. may be applied to the no&s;trils; and cold water and volatile foetids given.

<P>SYMPTOMS. Chilline&s;s, &s;hivering, heat, pain in the head and back, &s;ickne&s;s and pain at the &s;tomach, and &s;ometimes vomit|ing; fever, co&s;tivene&s;s, convul&s;ive fits &s;ometimes in children, which is a good &s;ymptom. On the third or fourth day the eruption appears, like flea-bites, in the face, brea&s;t, arms, body, and feet &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; pains and &s;orene&s;s in the throat. The eruption being compleated, the fever goes off or abates. The eruptions fill, or maturate like boils, and the &s;kin between them is al&s;o red; the eye-lids, face, hands, and feet, &s;well &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; the pocks from red, grow whiti&s;h and &s;mooth in the body, and yellow and rough in the face, full of a white matter. About the &s;eventh day from the eruption, (&s;ometimes the ninth) they dry, or turn as it is called, and &s;cale off, leaving red marks, and &s;ometimes pits behind.</P>
<P>TREATMENT. If the pul&s;e be full and &s;trong at the beginning, bleed; and if nece&s;&s;ary, or the period be &s;ufficiently early, purge, and give an emetic. During the eruptive fever, cooling febrifuges, with laxatives, or cly&s;ters occa&s;ionally; but if the &s;ymptoms require it (as low pul&s;e, &amp;c.) gentle cordials and diaphoretics. After the eruption, little is generally required but a gentle anodyne at night, proper diluents, and if nece&s;&s;ary, opening cly&s;ters, &amp;c. If purging come on, check it with caution; if delirium or fever, apply bli&s;ters; and if the pock &s;ink, give bark, with proper diaphoretics and cordials; e&s;pecially if malignant or putrid &s;ymptoms, or petechiae appear. Spt. vitrioli dulcis is al&s;o good in the&s;e ca&s;es, as are &s;inapi&s;ms to the feet.</P>
<P>In the confluent kind, all the &s;ymtoms are wor&s;e than in the di&s;tinct. The eruption makes its appearance a day or two later, and does not come to its height till the eleventh or fourteenth day after; the fever al&s;o continues after the eruption appears, and a &s;ali|vation comes on, which mu&s;t by no means be checked. The patient requires to be &s;upported more in this ca&s;e than in the other; care, however, mu&s;t be taken in both kinds to avoid too much heat, or a heating regimen; and pure, and even cool

air, where no objection appears, is &s;alutary. If the pu&s;tules are opened, and the matter let out, &s;o much the better; e&s;pecially if danger of their &s;inking or &s;triking in appear. Purging is e&s;teemed proper after this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>To inoculate for the Small Pox, take a little matter from a pu&s;tule, after the eruptive fever, on the point of a lancet, and in&s;ert it in the arm (by making a &s;mall puncture or two) between the true and &s;carf &s;kin, which may afterwards be pre&s;&s;ed down with the &s;lat &s;ide of the lancet. Three or four days afterwards the punctures appear inflamed; in about three days more the pre|cur&s;ory &s;ymptoms come on, and at length the eruption.</P>
<P>Previous to the inoculation, a mercurial purge or two may be admini&s;tered, if the patient is of a full or gro&s;s habit; and he &s;hould al&s;o be re&s;trained to a milk and farinaceous or vegetable diet, avoiding e&s;pecially high &s;ea&s;oned food. It is found be&s;t to keep him out of bed, and even now and then in the cold air. The &s;ymptoms are generally &s;o favourable, that little a&s;&s;i&s;tance is required from medicine, except a few mercurial purges after the di&s;order goes off.</P>
