Acquainted with the Nature, and Tenderly Affected towards the Nece&s;&s;ity's and Com|forts of Mankind, he hath not rendred Soci|ety an Impo&s;&s;ible Thing; but hath Placed us in le&s;&s;er Body's, wherein all the Advan|tages of the bigge&s;t may be had and enjoyed: although that <HI>City</HI> could not be <HI>Built,</HI> yet (<HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD,</HI>) <HI>City's</HI> and <HI>Corporations,</HI> and <HI>Kingdoms</HI> now there are; wherein we may enjoy the Comforts of Life, do Good to others and be Advantag'd by them; and Be&s;t An&s;wer the End of our Beings.</P>

The Text in Particu|lar Repre&s;ents to us the Glory's of this Place; and there are no other Parts of the P&s;alm, that I de&s;ign to Con&s;ider and De&s;cant on, but only as they may fall in, in the Sub|&s;equent Di&s;cour&s;e. The Words read are an ab&s;olute Sentence and di&s;tinct Propo&s;ition: <HI>Jeru&s;alem is Builded as a City, that is Compact together.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Thing</HI> here De&s;cribed is <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> And it may be con&s;idered in &s;everal Re|&s;pects: either barely as a particular Place and Portion of Land in the <HI>Kingdom of I&s;rael;</HI> or as a Place Comprehending the Inhabitants in a Civil Society; or &s;ince the <HI>Kingdom of I&s;rael</HI> was the only Kingdom where the True GOD was Wor&s;hipped, and <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was the Place for the Publick and Solemn Con|vention of his Wor&s;hippers three times An|nually, &s;o the Word may be a Term u&s;ed to Signify the Church of GOD by: Thus <HI>Gal.</HI> IV. 25. And it may al&s;o from thence be Typical of the Church of GOD now, as in <HI>Ver.</HI> 26. and in other Places.</P>
<P>The <HI>De&s;cription</HI> whereby <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> is &s;et out to us in our Text is, <HI>That it is Builed as
<PB N="5" REF="001878_0006_0FB97827704E7098">

without Inte&s;tine Divi&s;ions and Jarrs, keeping <HI>the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</HI> But the Occa&s;ions of the Day Lead me to Con&s;ider it in the Sen&s;e mentioned before; and I Hope the Text will Bear me out in it. And in Con&s;idering <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> thus, Namely, as a Civil Society Compre|hended in that Place, I &s;hall take no notice of the Particulars of it's <HI>Compactne&s;s</HI> here Referr'd to, any further than as they may fall in with other things in the Di&s;cour&s;e on the Words: In General I Ob&s;erve, the State of that Place, <HI>It was Compact together;</HI> And the <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> had of it's <HI>Excellency</HI> on this Account: for this is one thing he &s;et|teth it off by, and therefore was Glad of the Re&s;ort made to it, and thinks him&s;elf and others Bound to Seek and Pray it's Wel|fare.</P>
<P>My Bu&s;ine&s;s then will be, to &s;et this Truth in a Clear Light: Namely,</P>
<P><HI>That it is highly Conducive to the Happine&s;s of a Civil Government and Society to be Firmly United and Compacted.</HI></P>

What I de&s;ign for the Clearing of this Truth, is by &s;hewing

</LIST></P>
<P>I. I am to &s;hew wherein the <HI>Firmne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Compactne&s;s</HI> of a Place doth Con&s;i&s;t; or what tho&s;e things are that Conduce to it. And here do I intend to keep within the Compa&s;s of my own Profe&s;&s;ion; and to point out only to tho&s;e that may be Improved as Directions for the Obtaining of it. Now Omitting the mention of what is nece&s;&s;ary to the Primary and Fundamental E&s;tabli&s;hment of a Socie|ty, and the Formal Di&s;tinction of Society's from one another; I may &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>Compactne&s;s</HI> of a Place, That the <HI>Government</HI> be under a &s;uitable <HI>Admini&s;tration:</HI> whereby I Compre|hend the Quality's of tho&s;e who are in Power, and the Regular Improvement of it. And how well &s;oever a Society is Compacted together, what Prudent Laws and Con&s;titu|tions &s;oever are appointed, yet if the Over|&s;ight, Direction, and Execution of all things,
<PB N="8" REF="001878_0009_0FB9782FB3452328">
is Ve&s;ted in &s;uch as are <HI>Uncapable,</HI> or <HI>Unfaith|ful,</HI> there is no Pro&s;pect of the Firm Conti|nuance of &s;uch a Place: The Place is Deplo|rable where <HI>there are no &s;trong Rods for a Scepter to Rule.</HI> If the <HI>Head be Sick, the Heart will be Faint, and the Body Di&s;or|dered.</HI></P>
<P>There needs a continual In&s;pection into the State, and a Wi&s;e Ordering of things for the Honour and Pro&s;perity of Govern|ment; there &s;hould be a continual Looking out again&s;t Evils Approaching; there are many Contingency's that a Society is Ex|po&s;ed to, and give a new Face to things and Require a Wi&s;e Accomodation to them; there are Various Ferments in the Body which it concerns them to Appea&s;e, Allay and Cool.</P>
<P>Therefore Places of Eminence &s;hould be filled with Per&s;ons of Eminent Accompli&s;h|ments. Among which we may Reckon, a Thorough Penetration, a Deep Sen&s;e of things, a Practical and Political <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Prudence.</HI> This <HI>is Better than Strength, Prov.</HI> IX. 10. <HI>For it is by a man of Under&s;tanding and Knowledge that the State of a Land is Pre&s;erved, Prov.</HI> XXVIII. 2.

other Qualifications a man hath, yet if there be a Remarkable Defect in Wi&s;dom, he will not have a due Sen&s;e of his Place, or have True Rules to go by, or Spy Dan|gers Pre&s;ent or Approaching, or know what to Choo&s;e for, or Apply as Preventives or Cures.</P>
<P>Wi&s;dom will Teach men the Ends of Go|vernment; the Glory of GOD, the Beauty, Order and Good of the World: It will &s;hew them wherein the Happine&s;s of a Place doth con&s;i&s;t, Offer them the be&s;t Maxims and Rules, &s;et before them the be&s;t Examples, help them to the mo&s;t likely Methods wherein to Pro&s;ecute the Ends of Govern|ment; and the People &s;hall be <HI>Led by the Skilfulne&s;s of their Hands:</HI> It will give them a due Knowledge of the Nature of Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n general, of the Community to which they belong, of particular Per&s;ons, of Ca&s;es, and Times of Action: It will give them a due Knowledge of Him who is the Fountain of Power and Authority, who&s;e Honour it is a Peoples Duty and Intere&s;t to con&s;ult, <HI>who&s;e Kingdom is an Everla&s;ting Kingdom, and who&s;e Dominion is from Generation to Generation:</HI> It will give them a due Knowledge of them|&s;elves that they may not be too much Ele|vated in their own Conceits and Giddy by their Eminence; that they may know that

they are but men Ve&s;ted with Power by God to be Improved according to his Will; and that they are Accountable to him.</P>
<P>And this leadeth me to add <HI>Religion,</HI> the mo&s;t Elevated <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of all, and without which all other is but In&s;ipid and Fruitle&s;s; as God &s;aith by the Prophet, <HI>Jer.</HI> VIII 9. <HI>They have rejected the Coun&s;el of the Lord, and what Wi&s;dom is in them?</HI> If Rulers are govern'd by the Love of GOD, they will in their Publick as well as in their Private Actions, expre&s;s Him, who is <HI>Holy in all his Ways, and Righteous in all his Works; who Judgeth the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and the Peo|ple with Equity;</HI> who though he is a Sove|reign Being, is Sovereignly Wi&s;e, Good, Ju&s;t, and Merciful. If they have Truely Subjected them&s;elves to CHRIST, they will Learn of him, who <HI>Judgeth not after the Sight of the Eyes, nor Reproves after the Hearing of the Ears; who Judgeth the Poor with Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and Reproves with Equity for the Meek of the Earth; who hath Righteou&s;ne&s;s for the Girdle of his Loyns, and Faithfulne&s;s for the Girdle of his Reins.</HI></P>
<P>With Wi&s;dom may be joyn'd a Cool and Calm Mind, whereby things may be duely Debated and Con&s;idered, and a People may be Pre&s;erved from Hot and Precipitate Actions.</P>

So that not only in Faithfulne&s;s to our own Souls, but al&s;o from a Love to our People, and <HI>the City of our GOD,</HI> we are Obliged to Be&s;tir our &s;elves in our Work, and be Faithful in every Part of it, and Conduct our &s;elves Wi&s;ely to the Promoting it. May I here Hint tho&s;e things, which it were Proper for me to Learn of you.</P>
<P>What Care and Prudence becometh us in our Common Conduct and Deportment of our &s;elves in the World? For that hath an Influence on our Serviceablene&s;s in our Station. Though where the Gifts of a Mini&s;ter are Exten&s;ive, I know not why his Improvement may not be &s;o too; yet at the &s;ame time it becometh us to <HI>be Wi&s;e as Serpents and Harmle&s;s as Doves&punc;</HI> We know the Vile Words that are ca&s;t about, of <HI>Prie&s;t-Cra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t,</HI> and Prie&s;t-Ridden, and an <HI>Ambitious</HI> and <HI>De&s;igning Clergy,</HI> and the like Effu&s;ions of Men's Corrupt Minds&punc; and the Jealou&s;ies the World hath of us. It

therefore here &s;tandeth us in &s;tead to Labour after a Spotle&s;s Innocency; and to &s;ee that all our De&s;igns be Wor|thy of our Station, and Truly Chri&s;ti|an.</P>
<P>And when we are going to Promote Religion in the World, how doth it become us to give it Life and Power in our own Souls? Our People Expect we &s;hould Walk in the &s;ame Path we Direct them to, and the mo&s;t Ob&s;equious Language to a Mi|ni&s;ter is, <HI>I Prae, Sequar.</HI> If we would Pre&s;s Religion on our People's Hearts, our Lives are the be&s;t Seal; and they will make our Services more Excellent. Can we &s;o well Declare the Excellency of Religion, unle&s;s our own Hearts Feel it? Can we make &s;uch Warm Addre&s;&s;es to the Souls of Men as we &s;hould, if our own Hearts are Frozen and Dead? Can we have the Courage to Reprove Iniquity, if our own Con&s;ciences at the &s;ame time Reprove us? Can we Comfort Men with the Hopes of Heaven if we are Indifferent to all the Joys of it? We are Obliged not only to have the Reality of Religion in our Souls, but the Highe&s;t Dgrees and the Greate&s;t Exactne&s;s of it. Might not this be a Rea&s;on that the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> Exhorted <HI>Timothy</HI> to <HI>Exerci&s;e him&s;elf unto Godline&s;s,</HI> I <HI>Tim.</HI> IV. 7. Are

<P>And having Ob&s;erved this Rule, and Liv|ing in the Practi&s;e of it, let us &s;et our &s;elves to our Work, and make it our Daily Care and Study. Indeed &s;uch are the Avo|cations and Difficulties of many of us that we are to our Sorrow much Hindred; but let them hinder us only where they are Real and Unavoidable, and only as far as they are &s;o. But &s;uch as are Ble&s;s't with Ea&s;y Cir|cum&s;tances in the World, they are Inexcu|&s;able if they do not <HI>give them&s;elves wholly to the&s;e things,</HI> and <HI>make their Profiting</HI> under &s;uch Circum&s;tances, <HI>Appear.</HI> And let them be Exemplary in Acts of Charity and Ho&s;|pitality, and not in the Eager and Vehe|ment De&s;ires of the Worldling. If their Places have not &s;o Enabled them, God hath: And how can they better Be&s;tow them&s;elves and what they have, than in his Service, and for the Good of his Peo|ple?</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have been Nece&s;&s;arily En|gaged in Worldly Affairs, would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o Well

And having been taken off from their Proper Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s, it is to be Feared, That &s;ome have not Returned to it, that is, to their Studies, when God hath Ble&s;s't them in their Endeavours, and Enabled them to it.</P>
<P>And tho&s;e of us who may be by Out|ward Low Circum&s;tances kept off much from our Work, let it not carry us too far. We may Po&s;&s;ibly Redeem more time than we do in this Affair. <HI>Pliny's</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plin.</HI> Jun. Lib. 7.

And as God made the <HI>Ravens to Feed Elijah,</HI> So Doubtle&s;s he will one way or other, <HI>Feed us with Food Convenient for us.</HI> If God maketh us Ble&s;&s;ings in our Work, this may Comfort us in all our Sorrows, that through our Sufferings we Promote the Good of the World, and Prepare Men

<P>We have greater things to mind, than our own Particular, Temporal Intere&s;ts, even the Saving Men's Souls and the Good of the World. To that End let us Be&s;tir our &s;elves in the following Manner,</P>
<P>Let us <HI>put Men in Mind to be Subject to Principalities and Powers, to Obey Magi&s;trates, to be Ready to every Good Work, to Speak Evil of no man, to be no Brawlers, but Gentle, Shewing all Meekne&s;s to all Men.</HI> This is a Nece&s;&s;ary Work, and thereby we directly Level at the Good of the State, and if ever the thing is Proper to be Enforced, doth not the Pre&s;ent Time Peculiarly call us to it?</P>
<P>And let us Repre&s;ent the Whole of Religion in it's Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Beau|ty, and Pre&s;s it on the Affections of our People. The Good Succe&s;s of &s;uch En|deavours could not be too much Prized.

<P>To Conclude, Let Wi&s;dom and Prudence, Fidelity and Con&s;cience, Zeal and an Un|flacken'd Indu&s;try, Appear in our Work. God knoweth how few Moments we have to continue in it.
