<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE CHRISTIAN READER And especially to the Church <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Massachusets-Colony in NEW-ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>T<HI>Hat one end designed by God's All-disposing Providence, in leading so many of his poor people into this Wilderness, was to lead them unto a distinct discerning and practise of all the Wayes and Ordinances of his House according to Scripture-pattern, may seem an Observation not to be despised. That we are fit or able for so great a service, the sense of our own feebleness forbids us to thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; But that we have large and great opportunity for it, none will deny. For, besides the useful Labours and Contemplations of many of the Lords Worthies in other places, and in former times, contributing to our Help, and shewing our Principles to be neither novell nor singular, the advantage of Experience and Practise, and the occasion thereby given for daily searching into the Rule, is considerable. And He that hath made</HI> the path of the just as the shining light, <HI>is wont still to give unto them further light, as the progress of their path requires f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rther practise, making his</HI> Word a Lanthorn to their feet, <HI>to shew them their way from step to step, though haply sometimes they may not see far before them. It is matter of humbling to us, that we have made no bet|ter improvement of our opportunities this way; but some Fruits God hath given, and is to be praised for.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In forme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and while sundry of the Lords eminent Servants, now at rest, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> labours, were yet with us.</HI> A Platform of Church-Discipline, <HI>comprizing the brief summe thereof, especially in reference to the</HI> Constitution <HI>of Churches (which was our first work when we came into this Wilderness) was agreed upon by a</HI> Synod <HI>held at</HI> Cambridge, <HI>and published to the world: From which (as to the substance thereof) we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> see no cause to recede. Some few particulars referring to the</HI> Continuation and Combination <HI>of Churches, needed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">

stating and reducing unto practise. For though the Principles thereof were included in what is already published, yet that there hath been a defect in practise (especially since of late years there, was more occasion for it) is too too apparent: For the rectifying whereof, a more particular Explication of the Doctrine also about these things, is now necessary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In order hereunto, by the Care and Wisdome of our Honoured</HI> Gene|ral Court, <HI>calling upon all the</HI> Churches <HI>of this Colony, to send their</HI> Elders <HI>and</HI> Messengers, <HI>this</HI> Synod <HI>was assembled, who after earnest Supplications for Divine Assistance, having consulted the holy Scriptures touching the Questions proposed to them, have proceeded to the following Issue; hoping that if it might seem meet to the Father of Lights to guide the Churches unto a right Understanding and Practise of his Will in these things also, the beauty of Christ's wayes and Spiritual Kingdome among us would be seen in some more compleatness then formerly. For that which was the prayer of</HI> Epaphras <HI>for the</HI> Colossians, <HI>ought to be both the prayer and labour of us all;</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that we might stand perfect and compleat in all the will of God: <HI>And we trust it is our sincere desire, that his Will, all his Will, and nothing else but his Will, might be done among us.</HI> To the Law and to the Testimony <HI>we do wholly referre our selves, and if any thing in the following Conclusions be indeed found not to speak according thereunto, let it be rejected.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We are not ignorant that this our Labour will by divers be diversly censured; some will account us too strict in the Point of</HI> Baptism, <HI>and others too laxe and large: But let the Scriptures be Judge between us all. There are two things, the Honour whereof is in a special manner dear to God, and which He cannot endure to be wronged in;</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>His</HI> Holiness, <HI>and His</HI> Grace. <HI>The Scripture is often putting us in minde how much the Lord loveth Holiness, and that in his House, and in the holy Ordinan|ces ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of, and how he abhorreth the contrary,</HI> Mal 2. 11. Psal. 93. 5. &amp; 2. 6. Lev. 11. 44, 45. Ezek 22. 26. &amp; 44. 7, 8. <HI>And hence neither dare we admit those unto the holy Table of the Lord, that are short of Scripture-qualifications for it;</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Ability to</HI> examine themselves, <HI>and</HI> discern the Lords body; <HI>Nor yet receive or retain those in Church-estate, and own them as a part of the Lords holy People, that are visibly and notoriously unholy, wicked and prophane: such we are bidden to</HI> Put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI>5. 13. <HI>and therefore ought not to continue
<PB REF="000068_0004_0F9F1B2307E0C8E0">
among us. Neither may we administer Baptism to those whose parents are not under any Church-power or Government any where. To baptize such, would be to give the Title and Livery to those that will not bear the yoke of Christs Disciples, and to put the holy Name of God upon them, touching whom we can have no tolerable security that they will be edu|cated in the wayes of Holiness, or in the knowledge and practise of Gods holy Will.</HI> Baptism, <HI>which is the Seal of Membership in the Church</HI> the Body of Christ, <HI>and an</HI> engaging Sign, <HI>importing us to be the devoted</HI> Subjects <HI>of Christ, and of all his holy Government, is not to be made a common thing, nor to be given to those, between whom and the God-less licentious world there is no visible difference: This would be a provocation and dishonour to</HI> the Holy One of Israel.</P>
<P><HI>On the other hand, we finde in Scripture, that the Lord is very ten|der of his</HI> Grace; <HI>that he delighteth to manifest and magnifie the Riches of it, and that he cannot endure any straitning or eclipsing thereof, which is both dishonourable unto God, and injurious unto men,</HI> Gal.2 21. Eph.2.7. &amp; 3. 2,6,8. Rom 11. 1,5. Acts 15. 10,11. &amp; 10. 15 &amp; 20. 24,26,27. <HI>And in special he is large in the</HI> Grace of his Covenant <HI>which he maketh with his</HI> visible Church <HI>and People, and tender of having the same straitned. Hence when he takes any into Covenant with himself, he will not only be</HI> their God, <HI>but</HI> the God of their seed after them in their generations, <HI>Genes.</HI> 17. 7,9. <HI>And although the apostate wicked parent (that rejecteth God and his Wayes) do cut off both himself and his Children after him,</HI> Exod. 20&punc; 5. &amp; 34. 7. <HI>Yet the Mercy and Grace of the Covenant is extended to the faithful and their seed unto</HI> a thousand generations, <HI>if the successive parents do but in the least degree shew themselves to be</HI> lovers of God, and keepers of his <HI>Covenant and</HI> Commandments, <HI>so as that the Lord will never reject them till they reject him,</HI> Exod 20. 6. Deut. 7. 9. Psal 105. 8, 9. Rom. 11. 16&mdash;22. <HI>Hence we dare not (with the Antipaedobaptist) exclude the</HI> Infant-children of the faithful <HI>from the</HI> Covenant, <HI>or from</HI> Membership <HI>in the visible Church, and consequently not from</HI> Baptism <HI>the Seal thereof. Neither dare we exclude the same children from Membership (or put them out of the Church) when they</HI> are grown up, <HI>while they so walk and act, as to keep their standing in the Covenant, and doe not reject the same. God owns them still, and they doe in some measure
<PB REF="000068_0005_0F9F1B23C3D0AF40">
own him: God rejects them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and therefore neither way we; and con|sequently</HI> their children <HI>also are not to be rejected. Should we reject or exclude any of these, we should shorten and straiten the grace of God's Covenant, more then God himself doth, and be injurious to the Souls of men, by putting them from under those Dispensations of Grace, which are stated upon the visible Church, whereby the children of God's visible people are successively in their Generations to be trained up for the King|dome of Heaven, (whither the Elect number shall still be brought in the way of such means) and wherein he hath given unto Officers and Chur|ches a solemn charge to take care of, and train up such, as a part of his flock, to that end; saying to them, as sometimes to</HI> Peter, If you love me, feed my lambs. <HI>In obedience to which charge we hope it is, that we are willing and desirous (though will the inference of no small labour and burthen to our selves) to commend these Truths to the Churches of Christ; that</HI> all the Flock, <HI>even the Lambs thereof, being duly stated under</HI> Pastoral <HI>Power, we might after a faithfull discharge of our Duty to them, be able, to give up our</HI> account <HI>another day</HI> with joy and not with grief.</P>
<P><HI>How hard it is to finde and keep the right middle way of Truth in these things, is known to all that are ought acquainted with the Controversies there-about. As we have learned and believed, we have spoken; but not without remembrance that we are poor feeble frail men, and there|fore desire to be conversant herein with much humility and fear before God and man. We are not ignorant of variety of judgements con|cerning this Subject; which notwithstanding, with all due reverence to Dissenters, after Religious search of the Scriptures, we have here offered what seems to us to have the fullest Evidence of Light from thence; if more may be added, and may be found contained in the Word of God, this shall be no prejudice thereunto. Hence also we are farre from de|siring that there should be any rigorous imposition of these things (especi|ally as to what is more narrow therein, and more controversal among godly men.) If the Honoured Court see meet so f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rre to adde their count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|tenance and concurrence, as to commend a serious consideration hereof to the Churches, and to secure those that can with clearness of judge|ment practise accordingly, from disturbance, that in this case may be sufficient. To tolerate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> desire a Toleration of damnable Heresies, or of Subverters of the Fundamentals of Faith or Order, we can
<PB REF="000068_0006_0F9F1B248D7ED580">
irreligious inconsistency with the love of true Religion: But to bear one with another in lesser differences, about matters of a more difficult and con|troversal nature, and more remote from the Foundation, and wherein the godly-wise are not like-minded, is a Duty necessary to the peace and wel|fare of Religion, while we are in the state of infirmity. In such things let not him that practiseth</HI> despise him <HI>that forbeareth, and let not him that forbeareth</HI> judge him <HI>that practiseth,</HI> for God hath received him.</P>
<P><HI>But as we do not thus speak from doubting of the Truth here delivered</HI> (Paul knows <HI>where the Truth lyes, and</HI> is perswaded of it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.14. <HI>yet he can lovingly bear a Dissenter, and in like manner should we) So we do in the bowels of Christ Jesus commend the consideration of these things unto our Brethren in the several Churches. What is here offered is farre from being any declining from former Principles, it is rather a pursuance thereof; for it is all included in, or deducible from what we unanimously professed and owned in the fore-mentioned</HI> Platform of Discipline, <HI>many years since. There it is asserted, that</HI> Children are Church-members; That they have many priviledges which others (not Church-members) have not; and that they are under Discipline in the Church, <HI>chap.</HI> 12.<HI>sect.</HI> 7. <HI>and that will infor the right of their children, they continuing to walk orderly. And the other matter of</HI> Consociation, <HI>or exercise of</HI> Communion of Churches, <HI>is largely held forth</HI> Chap.15. &amp; 16.</P>
<P><HI>It may be an Objection lying in the mindes of some, and which many may desire a fuller Answer unto; That these things, or some of them, are</HI> Innovations <HI>in our Church-wayes, and things which the Lord's Wor|thies in</HI> New-England, <HI>who are now with God, did never teach nor hold, and therefore why should we now, after so many years, fall upon new Opinions and Practises? Is not this</HI> a declining <HI>from our first Purity, and a blameable Alteration? To this: Although it were a sufficient Answer to say, That in matters of Religion, not so much what</HI> hath been <HI>held or practised, as what</HI> should be, <HI>and what the Word of God pre|scribes, ought to be our Enquiry and our Rule. The people in</HI> Nehemiah's <HI>time are commended for doing as</HI> they found written in the Law, <HI>though</HI> from the dayes of Joshua the son of Nun, unto that day, the children of Israel had not done so, <HI>Nehem.</HI> 8. 14, 17. <HI>See the like</HI> 2 Chron. 30. 5,26. 2 Kings 23. 21,22. <HI>they did not tye themselves to former use custome, but to the Rule of Gods written Word, and so

should we. It was</HI> Thyatira'<HI>s praise, that their good works were</HI> more at the last then at the first, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 19. <HI>The Lord's humble and faithfull Servants are not wont to be forward to think themselves</HI> perfect <HI>in their attainments, but desirous rather to make</HI> a Progress <HI>in the knowledge and practise of God's holy Will. If therefore the things here poopounded concerning the children of Church-members, and the Consociation of Churches, be a part of the Will of God contained in the Scriptures, (as we hope the Discourse ensuing will shew them to be) that doth suffici|ently bespeak their entertainment, although, they had not formerly been held or heard of amongst us. Yet this must not be granted, the contra|ry being the Truth,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>that the Points herein which may be most scrupled by some, are known to have been the judgement of the genera|lity of the Elders of these Churches for many years, and of those that have been of most eminent esteem among us. As (besides what was be|fore mentioned from the</HI> Platform of Discipline) <HI>may appear by the following</HI> Testimonies, <HI>from sundry Eminent and Worthy</HI> Ministers of Christ <HI>in</HI> New-England, <HI>who are now with God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First, Touching the children of Church-members.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Cotton <HI>hath this saying;</HI> The Covenant and Blessing of <HI>Abraham</HI> is that which we plead for, which the Apostle saith is come upon us Gentiles, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 14. which admitteth the faithful and their Infant-seed, not during their lives, in case their lives should grow up to Apostacy or open Scandal, but during their infancy, and so long after as they shall continue in a visible profession of the Covenant and Faith, and Religion of their fathers: otherwise, if the children of the faithful grow up to Apostacy, or any open Scan|dal, (as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">shmael</HI> and <HI>Esau</HI> did) as they were then, so such like now are to be cast out of the fellowship of the Covenant, and of the Seals thereof. <HI>Grounds and Ends of Baptism of Children</HI> p.106. <HI>see also</HI> p 133,134. <HI>Again,</HI> The seed of the Israelites, though many of them were not sincerely godly, yet whilest they held forth the pub|lick profession of God's people, <HI>Deut.</HI> 26. 3&mdash;11. and continued un|der the wing of the Covenant, and subjection to the Ordinances, they were still accounted an holy seed, <HI>Ezra</HI> 9. 2. and so their children were partakers of Circumcision. Yea further, though themselves were sometimes kept from the Lords Supper (the Passeover) for some or other uncleanness, yet that debarred not their children from
<PB REF="000068_0008_0F9F1B260940D5E0">
Circumcision. Against this may it not seem vain to stand upon a difference between the Church of Israel and our Churches of the New-Testament&mdash;For the same Covenant which God made with the National Church of Israel and their seed, it is the very same for substance, and none other, which the Lord makes with any Congre|gational Church, and our seed. <HI>Quaery</HI> 9^t^h <HI>of Accommodation and Com|munion of Presbyt. and Congrega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; Churches. And the same for sub|stance with those Quaeries, was delivered by him in 12. Propositions, as Mr.</HI> Tho: Allen <HI>witnesseth in Epist. to the Reader before Treat. of Co|venant and those Quaeries. Now in the 8^t^h of those Propositions he hath these words:</HI> The children of Church-members with us, though baptized in their infancy, yet when they come to age they are not re|ceived to the Lords Supper, nor admitted to fellowship of Voting in Admissions, Elections, Censures, till they come to profess their Faith and Repentance, and to lay hold of the Covenant of their pa|rents before the Church; and yet they being not cast out of the Church, nor from the Covenant thereof, their children as well as themselves being within the Covenant, they may be partakers of the first Seal of the Covenant. <HI>Lastly, speaking to that Objection,</HI> That the Baptism of Infants overthrows and destroys the Body of Christ, the holy Temple of God; and that in time it will come to consist of natural and carnal Members, and the power of Government rest in the hands of the wicked. <HI>He Answers,</HI> That this puts a fear where no fear is, or a causless fear. <HI>And in prosecution of his Answer he hath these words;</HI> Let the Primitive Practise be restored to its purity, (<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>that due care be taken of baptized members of the Church for their fitting for the Lords Table</HI>) and then there will be no more fear of pestering Churches with a carnal generation of mem|bers baptized in their infancy, then of admitting a carnal company of hypocrites confessing their Faith and Repentance in the face of the Congregation. Either the Lord in the faithfulness of his Co|venant will sanctifie the hearts of the baptized Infants to prepare them for his Table, or else he will discover their hypocrisie and pro|faneness in the presence of his Church before men and Angels, and so prevent the pollution of the Lords Table, and corruption of the Discipline of the Church by their partaking in them. <HI>Grounds and Ends of Baptism, &amp;c.</HI> P. 161,163. <HI>See also Holiness of Church-members,

members,</HI> p. 41,51,56,57,63,87. <HI>Bloody Tenent washed,</HI> p. 44,78.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Hooker <HI>saith,</HI> Suppose a whole Congregation should consist of such who were children to Parents now deceased who were con|federate, their children were true members according to the Rules of the Gospel, by the profession of their fathers Covenant, though they should not make any personal and vocal expression of their en|gagement as the fathers did. <HI>Survey, part</HI> 1. P. 48. <HI>Again,</HI> We maintain according to truth, that the believing parent covenants and confesseth for himself and his posterity, and this covenanting then and now is the same for the kinde of it. <HI>Part</HI> 3. p. 25. <HI>See</HI> p. 17,18. &amp; part 1. p. 69,76,77. <HI>And in the Preface, setting down sundry things, wherein he consents with Mr.</HI> R. <HI>he expresseth this for one, that</HI> Infants of visible Churches born of wicked parents, being members of the Church, ought to be baptized. In these (<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aith he</HI>) and several other particulars, we fully accord with Mr. <HI>R. And Part</HI> 3. p. 11. It is not then the Question, whether wicked members while they are tolerated f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">fully in the Church they and their children may partake of the Priviledges? for this is beyond question, nor do I know, nor yet ever heard it denied by any of ours.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Philips, <HI>speaking of</HI> a people made partakers of Gods Cove|nant, and all the priviledges outwardly belonging thereto, <HI>he saith,</HI> Themselves and all that ever proceed from them, continue in the same state, parents and children successively, so long as the Lord continues the course of his Dispensation; nor can any alteration befall them, whereby this estate is dissolved, but some apparent act of God break|ing them off from him. <HI>Reply,</HI> p. 126. <HI>Again, speaking of that Ho|liness,</HI> 1 Cor. 7. 14. <HI>he saith,</HI> I take it of foederal holiness, whereby the children are with the believing parents taken by God to be his, and by him put under his covenant, and so they continue when men of year, though they never have any further grace wrought in them, nor have any other state upon them, then what they had when they were born <HI>Ibid.</HI> p 131. Again, a company become or are a Church, either by conversion and initial constitution, or by continuance of the same constituted Churches successively by propagation of mem|bers, who all are born in the Church-state, and under the covenant of God, and belong unto the Church, and are a Church successively so long as God shall continue his begun dispensation, even as well &amp; as fully as the first. <HI>Ibid.</HI> p. 145.</P>
<P><PB REF="000068_0010_0F9F1B28864C3A78">
<HI>Mr.</HI> Shepard in <HI>Defence of the Nine Positions,</HI> p. 143. <HI>hath this expression,</HI> Concerning the Infants of Church-members, they are sub|ject to Censures whensoever they offend the Church, as others are, though so long as they live innocently they need them not. <HI>And in the year</HI> 1649. <HI>not three moneths before his Death, he wrote unto a friend a large Letter (yet extant under his own Hand) concerning the Mem|bership of Children, wherein he proveth by sundry Arguments</HI> that they are Members, <HI>and answereth sundry</HI> Objections <HI>against it, and sheweth at large</HI> what great good there is in children's Membership. <HI>In which Discourses he asserteth,</HI> That as they are Members in their in|fancy, so they continue Members when they are grown up, till for their wickedness they be cast out; and that they being Members, their seed successively are Members also, until by Dissolution or Ex|communication they be unchurched: That though they are Mem|bers, it follows not that they must come to the Lords Supper, but they must first appear able to examine themselves, and discern the Lords Body: That the children of godly parents, though they do not manifest faith in the Gospel, yet they are to be accounted of Gods Church, until they positively reject the Gospel, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. That this Membership of children hath no tendency in it to pollute the Church, no more then in the Old Testament, but is a means rather of the contrary; And that there is as much danger (if not more) of the degenerating and apostatizing of Churches gathered of pro|fessing Believers, as of those that rise out of the seed of such.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Prudden <HI>in a Letter to a friend written in the year</HI> 1651. <HI>doth plainly express it to be his judgement,</HI> That the children of Church-members, are Members, and so have right to have their children baptized though themselves be not yet admitted to the Lords Supper. <HI>His words are these:</HI> Touching the desire of such Members children as desire to have their children baptized, it is a thing that I do not yet hear practised in any of our Churches. But for my own part, I am inclined to think, that it cannot justly be denied, because their next Parents (however not admitted to the Lords Supper) stand as compleat Members of the Church, within the Church-Covenant, and so acknowledged that they might have right to Baptism. Now they being in Covenant, and standing Members, their Children also are Members by virtue of their Parents Covenant and Membership, as well as they themselves were by virtue of their Parents Covenant and Membership; And they have not renounced that Covenant, nor are justly censured for breach of that Cove|nant, but do own it and profess it, and by virtue of it claim the priviledge of it to their Children. <HI>Then he puts this his Argument into form thus:</HI> Those Children who are within the Covenant of the Curch, and so Members of it, Baptism cannot be denied unto. But the Children in question are within the Covenant of the Church, and so Members of it. Therefore Baptism cannot be denied unto them. The Assumption is proved thus: The
<PB REF="000068_0011_0F9F1B29D2366250">
Children of such Parents as are within the Covenant of the Church, and so Members of the Church, are themselves within the Covenant of the Church, and so Members of it. But the Children in question are Children of such Parents as are in Covenant, and so Members of the Church. Therefore they are so themselves. The Proposition is clear, because the Parents Covenant for themselves, and for their Children, <HI>Deut.</HI> 29. 10,&mdash;16. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16. 8,13. And God accepts both, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 12,13. the whole Nation is foederally holy, <HI>Ezra.</HI> 9. 2. they are expresly said to be in Covenant with their fathers, <HI>Deut.</HI> 29. not partly or partially in Covenant, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 3,4. <HI>Acts</HI> 2. 39. and God styles himself their God as well as their fathers, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 7,8,9. and to have God to be our God, is to be com|pleat Church-Covenant with him. The Assumption is evident, because else such their Pa|rents had not had right to Baptism the Seal of the Covenant, but that they had right unto, and so received it; and the same right that they had, their Children have, who are in|cluded in their Covenant, as they were in their fathers, and are not less <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ruely or less compleatly in Covenant.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> (<HI>to adde no more</HI>) <HI>Mr.</HI> Nath. Rogers, <HI>in a Letter to a Friend, bearing date</HI> 18. 11. 1652. <HI>hath these words:</HI> To the Question concerning the Children of Church-members, I have nothing to oppose, and I wonder any should deny them to be Members. They are Members <HI>in censu Ecclesiastico;</HI> God so calls them, the Church is so to account of them: And when they are <HI>adult <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tatis,</HI> though having done no personal act, yet are to be in Charity judged Members still, and till after die calling upon, they shall refuse or neglect to acknowledge and own the Covenant of their Parents, and profess their belief of, and subjection to the contents thereof&mdash;For Practise, I confess I account it our great default, that we have made no more real distinction between these and others, that they have been no more attended, as the lambs of the Flock of Christ: and whether it be not the cause of the corruption and woeful de|fection of our youth, <HI>disquiri permittimus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>So that it was the judgement of these Worthies in their time, that the children of Church-members are members of the Church as well as their parents, and do not cease to be members by becoming adult, but do still con|tinue in the Church, untill in some way of God they be cast out; and that they are subject to Church-discipline, even as other members; and may have their children baptized before themselves be received to the Lords Supper: and yet that in this way there is no tendency to the corrupting of the Church by unworthy members, or of the Ordinances by unworthy partakers. And in the</HI> Synod <HI>held at</HI> Cambridge <HI>in the year</HI> 1648. <HI>that particular point of Baptizing the children of such as were admitted members in minority, but not yet in full communion, was inserted in some of the draughts that were prepared for that Assembly, and was then de|bated and confirmed by the like Arguments as we now use, and was gene|rally consented to; though because some few dissented, and there was not the like urgency of occasion for present practise, it was not then put into the</HI> Platform <HI>that was after Printed. We need not mention the</HI> Meeting <HI>of</HI> Elders <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Boston <HI>upon the Call of the Honoured</HI> Court <HI>in the year</HI> 1657. <HI>where in</HI> Answer to XXI. Questions, <HI>since Printed, this Point is particularly asserted. By all which it appeareth, that these are not things lately devised, or before unheard-of, nor can they justly be censured
<PB REF="000068_0012_0F9F1B2A84E53068">
as</HI> Innovations <HI>or</HI> Declensions <HI>from the received Doctrine in</HI> New-England. <HI>It is true, that in the beginning of these Plantations, and the Infancy of these Churches, there was not so much said touching these things as there hath been since; and the reason is, Because then there was not the like occasion as since hath been: Few children of Church-members being then adult, at least few that were then married, and had children. Ac|cordingly, when a Question was put about the priviledges of Members children, when come to years, these Churches then having been but of few years standing, our Answer was, That by reason of the Infancy of these Churches, we had then had no occasion to determine what to judge or pra|ctise in that matter.</HI> Answer to the 5^t^h and 6^t^h of 32. Questions: <HI>which may satisfie as the Reason <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in our first beginnings there was no more said touching these Questions. But afterwards, when there was more cause for it, many of the Elders in these Churches, both such as are now living, and sundry who are now deceased, did declare their judgements at aforesaid, and this many years ago.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly, Touching Consociation of Churches, take these few Te|stimonies, in stead of many more that might be alledged.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Cotton, Keyes, P. 54: 55. It is a safe and wholsome and holy Ordinance of Christ, for particular Churches to joyn together in holy Covenant, or Communion &amp; Consociation among themselves, to administer all their Church-affairs (which are of weighty, and difficult and common concernment) not without common consulta|tion and consent of other Churches about them. <HI>And how it is so, he there shewe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h in all the particulars. See also</HI> P. 24. 25, 47 59.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Hooker, Survey, <HI>see</HI> part 4. p.1 2. &amp; p. 45. <HI>And in the Pre|face he professeth his consent with Mr.</HI> R. That Consociation of Chur|ches is not only lawful, but in some cases necessary. That when causes are difficult, and particular Churches want light and help they should crave the assistance of such a Consociation. That Churches so meeting have right to Counsel, Rebuke, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the case doth require. And in case any particular Church shall walk pertinaciously, either in the profession of Errour or sinful Practise, and will not hear their counsel they may and should renounce the right hand of fellowship with them. <HI>And after he sets down this of</HI> Consociation of Churches <HI>amongst other things, wherein</HI> be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad leave to profess the joynt Judge|ment of all the Elders upon the River; of <HI>New-haven, Gunford, Milford, Stratford, Fairfield, and most of the Elders in the Bay. By
<PB REF="000068_0013_0F9F1B2EA7637730">
which it is clear, that this point of Consociation of Churches is no new in|vention of these times, but was taught and professed in</HI> New-England <HI>many years agce, for sort was we see in Mr.</HI> Hooker's <HI>time, and it is now above fifteen years since he departed this life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To these of our own Ministers, we shall only adde a passage in the</HI> Apologetical Narration <HI>of Dr.</HI> Goodwyn, <HI>Mr.</HI> Nye, <HI>Mr.</HI> Sidra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h Simpson, <HI>Mr.</HI> Burroughes, <HI>and Mr.</HI> Bridge; <HI>wherein, besides much more to this purpose, touching the Remedy provided in the Congregational|way for mal-Administrations, or other miscarriages in Churches,</HI> p. 16&mdash;21. <HI>They set it down (in</HI> p. 21.) <HI>at their past and present Profession,</HI> That it <HI>is</HI> the most to be abhorred Maxime that any Religion hath ever made profession of, and therefore of all other the most contradi|ctory and dishonourable unto that of Christianity, that a single and particular Society of men, professing the Name of Christ, and pre|tending to be endowed with a Power from Christ, to judge them that are of the same Body and Society within themselves, should further arrogate unto themselves an exemption from giving account, or being censurable by any other, either Christian Magistrate above them, or Neighbour-Churches about them. <HI>See also Mr.</HI> Burroughes Heart-Divis. pag 43,47.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren, bear with us: Were it for our own Sakes, or Names, or In|terests, we should not be sollicitous to beg Charity of you. With us</HI> it is a small thing to be judged of man's day. <HI>But it is for your sakes, for your children's sake, and for the Lord's sake, that we increat for a cha|ritable, candid, and considerate Acceptation of our labour herein. It is that the</HI> Congregations <HI>of the Lord might be</HI> established <HI>before Him in</HI> Truth and Peace, <HI>and that they might have</HI> one heart and one way <HI>in the fear of God,</HI> for the good of them and of their children after them. <HI>Do we herein seek our selves? our own advantage, ease or glory? Surely we feel the contrary! What is it we desire, but that we might do our utmost to carry your poor Children to Heaven; and that we might see these Churches bound up together in the Bonds of Truth and Peace?</HI> For|give us this wrong. <HI>But should the Church-education of your children be by the want of your hearty concurrence, rendred either unseizible or in|effectual; should they live as</HI> Lambs in a large place, <HI>for want of your agreement to own them</HI> of the Flock, <HI>we beseech you to consider how un|comfortable the account hereof would be another day. We pray with the Apostle,</HI> that you do no evil, not that we should appear approved,
<PB REF="000068_0014_0F9F1B301DECA118">
but that you should do that which is <HI>good and right,</HI> though we be rejected. For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth: and this also we wish, even your perfection, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 7,8,9. <HI>How|ever, we hope after-ages will bear witness, that we have been in some measure faithful to the Truth in these things, and to this part of Christs Kingdome also in our generation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But we may not let pass this opportunity, without a word of Caution and Exhortation to the</HI> Youth <HI>of the Country, the</HI> children <HI>of our Chur|ches, whose Interest we have here asserted. Be not you puffed up with Pri|viledges, but humbled rather, in the awful sense of the Engagement, Duty and Danger that doth attend them: It is an high favour to have a place in</HI> Bethel, in the house of God, and in the gate of Heaven; <HI>but it is a</HI> Dreadful place: <HI>God will be</HI> sanctified <HI>in all that</HI> come nigh him. <HI>A place nigh unto God</HI> (<HI>or among his people who are</HI> near to him, Ps. 148. 14) <HI>is a place of great fear,</HI> Psa. 89. 7. Take heed <HI>therefore unto your selves, when owned as</HI> the people of the Lord your God, (<HI>Deut.</HI> 27. 9, 10.) left there should be among you any root that beareth gall and worm-wood. <HI>Take heed that you do not with a spirit of pride and haughtiness, or of vanity and flightness, either challenge or use any of your Priviledges. Think not to bear the Name of Christians, without bearing the Yoke of Christ. Remember, that all Relations to God and to his people, do come loaden with</HI> Duty; <HI>and all Gospel-duty must be done in</HI> humility. <HI>The wayes of the Lord are right, and the humble and serious shall walk in them, but proud Transgressors shall fall therein. Be not</HI> sons of Belial, <HI>that can bear no yoke: Learn subjection to Christs holy Government in all the parts and wayes thereof. Be subject to your godly Parents: Be subject to your spiritual Fathers and Pastors, and to all their instructions, Ad|monitions and Exhortations: Be subject unto faithful Brethren, and to words of counsel and help from them:</HI> Ye younger, submit your selves unto the elder; <HI>and to that end,</HI> be clothed with humility. <HI>Lye un|der the Word and Will of Christ, as dispensed and conveyed to you by all his appointed Instruments in their respective places. Break not in upon the Lord's Table (or upon the Priviledges of full Communion) without due qualification, and orderly admission thereunto, lest you</HI> eat and drink your own damnation. <HI>Be ordered, and take not upon you to or|der the affairs of Gods Family; that is not the place of those who are yet but in the state of Initiation and Education in the Church of God. Carry it in all things with a spirit of humility, modesty, sobriety and
<PB REF="000068_0015_0F9F1B343136C528">
fear, that our soules may not weep in secret for your</HI> pride, <HI>and that God may not</HI> resist &amp; reject <HI>you as a generation of his wrath. Oh that the Lord would pour out a spirit of Humiliation &amp; Repentance upon all the younger sort in the Country, (yea &amp; upon elder too, for our neglects) from</HI> Dan <HI>to</HI> Beersheba! <HI>Oh that we might meet at</HI> Bochim, <HI>because so ma|ny Canaanites of unsubdued, yea growing corruptions are found among us! Let it not be said, that when the first &amp; best generation in New-England were</HI> gathered to their fathers, there arose another generation after them that knew not the Lord. <HI>Behold, the</HI> Lord had a delight in your fathers to love them, <HI>and he hath chosen you</HI> their seed after them, <HI>to enjoy these Laberties &amp; Opportunities, as it is this day:</HI> Circumcise there|fore the fore-skin of your hearts, and be no more stiff-necked, <HI>but</HI> yield your selves to the Lord, <HI>and to the Order of</HI> His Sanctuary <HI>to seek him, and wait on him in all his wayes with holy fear and trembling, for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if you return unto him; if you seek him he will be found of you, but if you forsake him, he will cast you off for ever.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We shall conclude, when we have given the Reader a short account of the Work ensuing. The</HI> Propositions <HI>in Answer to the</HI> first Question, <HI>were (after much discussion and consideration from the Word of God</HI>) <HI>Voted and Concluded by the Assembly in</HI> the Particular terms <HI>as they are here expres|sed. The</HI> Arguments <HI>then used for their</HI> Confirmation, <HI>being drawn up by some deputed thereunto, after they had been several times read and con|sidered in the Assembly, were Voted and Consented to,</HI> as to the summe and substance <HI>thereof. The Answer to the</HI> second Question <HI>is here given with great brevity, partly because so much is already said there-about in the foresaid</HI> Platform of Discipline, <HI>and partly by reason of great straits of time: But what is here presented was the</HI> joynt conclusion <HI>of the Sy|nod. A</HI> Preface <HI>was desired by the Assembly to be prefixed by some appointed thereunto, which is here accordingly by them performed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now the God of truth &amp; peace guide us &amp; all his people in the wayes, &amp; give us the fruits thereof; help us to</HI> feed <HI>his stock and his lambs, &amp; to be</HI> fed <HI>by him as the sheep of his pasture, that when the</HI> chief-Shepherd shall ap|pear, <HI>we may</HI> receive <HI>together</HI> a Crown of glory that fadeth not away, <HI>&amp; may enter into the joy of our Lord, as those that have neither despised his</HI> little ones, <HI>nor denied to be our</HI> Brother's keeper: <HI>But having faithfully en|devoured to promote the continuation of his Kingdom, &amp; Communion of his people, may Rest &amp; Reign with all Saints in the kingdom of his glory:</HI> Unto whom be glory in the Church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without end.</P>

<HEAD>THE ANSWER OF THE ELDERS AND OTHER MESSENGERS of the Churches, Assembled at Boston in the Year 1662, TO The Questions Propounded to them by ORDER of the Honoured GENERAL COURT.</HEAD>
<P>Quest, 1. <HI>WHo are the Subjects of Baptism?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ: The Answer</HI> may be given in the fol|lowing propositions, briefly confirmed from the Scriptures.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They that according to Scripture, are Members of the Visible Church, are the subjects of Baptisme.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Members of the Visible Church according to scrip|ture, are Confederate visible Believers, in particular Church|es, and their infant-seed,</HI> i. e. <HI>children in minority, whose next parents, one or both, are in Covenant.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>The Infant-seed of confederate visible Believers, are members of the same Church with their parents, and when grown up, are personally under the watch, discipline and Go|vernment of that Church.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>These Adult persons, are not therefore to be admitted to full Communion, meerly because they are and continue
<PB N="2" REF="000068_0017_0F9F1B3543C76840">
members, without such further qualifications, as the Word of God requireth therunto.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5 <HI>Church-members who were admitted in minority, under|standing the Doctrine of Faith, and publickly professing their assent thereto; not scandalous in life, and solemnly owning the Covenant before the Church, wherin they gave up themselves and their children to the Lord, and subject themselves to the Government of Christ in the Church, their children are to be Baptised.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6 <HI>Such Church-members, who either by death, or some other extraordinary Providence, have been inevitably hindred from publick acting as aforesaid, yet have given the Church cause in judgment of charity, to look at them as so qualified, and such as had they been called thereunto, would have to acted, their children are to be Baptised.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7 <HI>The members of Orthodox Churches, being sound in the Faith, and not scandalous in life, and presenting due testimo|ny thereof; these occasionally comming from one Church to another, may have their children Baptised in the Church whither they come, by virtue of communion of churches: but if they remove their habitation, they ought orderly to co|venant and subject themselves to the Government of Christ in the church where they settle their abode, and so their children to be Baptised. It being the churches duty to receive such unto communion, so farr as they are regular|ly sit for the same.</HI></P>
<P>The Confirmation of these Propositions from the Scripture followeth.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>Proposition First.</HEAD>
<P><HI>They that according to Scripture are members of the visible Church, are the subjects of Baptisme.</HI></P>
<P>The trueth hereof may appear by the following evidences from the word of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. When Christ saith, <HI>Go ye therefore and</HI> teach, or (as the Greek is) <HI>disciple all Nations, Baptising them, Mat.</HI>28.19

he expresseth the adequate subject of Baptisme, to be <HI>disciples,</HI> or <HI>discipled ones.</HI> But <HI>disciples</HI> there is the same with <HI>members of the visible church:</HI></P>
<P>For the visible Church is Christs <HI>school,</HI> wherein all the mem|bers stand related and subjected to him, as their Master and Teacher, and so are his <HI>Scholars</HI> or <HI>disciples,</HI> and under his teaching, as <HI>verse</HI> 20. And it is that visible spiritual Kingdome of Christ, which he there from his Kingly power, <HI>ver:</HI> 18. send|eth them to set up and administer in <HI>ver:</HI> 19. the subjects where|of are under his Lawes and Government: <HI>verse</HI> 20. Which subjects (or members of that Kingdome <HI>i. e.</HI> of the visible church) are termed disciples <HI>verse</HI> 19. Also in the Acts of the Apostles (the story of their accomplishment of that commission) <HI>disciples</HI> are usually put for <HI>members of the visible church: Acts</HI> 1.15 <HI>In the mids of the disciples:</HI> who with others added to them, are called <HI>the church, Acts</HI> 2:47: The members whereof are again called <HI>disciples, Acts</HI> 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 1,2. <HI>Acts</HI> 9;1&mdash;<HI>against the dis|ciples of the Lord,</HI> i.e against <HI>the church of God.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15 9 <HI>Gal.</HI> 1 13 <HI>Acts</HI> 9 26 <HI>He assayed to joyn himself to the dis|ciples.

<P N="2">2. Baptism is <HI>the seal of first entrance or admission into the visible church;</HI> as appeareth from those texts 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 12:13. <HI>Baptised into one body,</HI> ie. our entrance into the body or church of Christ, is sealed by Baptisme: and <HI>Rom;</HI> 6 3,5 <HI>Gal.</HI> 3:27. where it is shewed that Baptisme is the Sacrament of <HI>union</HI> or of ingrafting into Christ the head, and consequently into the church his body &amp; from the Apostles costant practise in baptising

persons upon their first comming in, or first giving up themselves to the Lord and them. <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 12. &amp; 16.15,33. &amp; 18.8. and in <HI>Acts</HI> 2.41,42 they were baptized at their first <HI>adding</HI> to the church, or admission into the <HI>Apostles fellowship,</HI> wherin they af|terward <HI>continued.</HI> And from its answering unto circum|cision, which was a seal of initiation or admission into the church; Hence it belongs to all and onely those that are entred into, that are within, or that are members of the visible church.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They that according to Scripture are members of the visi|ble Church, they are in Covenant.</HI> For it is the Covenant that constituteth the Church, <HI>Deut</HI> 29. 12,13.

5. <HI>The Circumcision is often put for the whole Jewish Church or for the members of the visible Church under the Old Testament.</HI> Those within are expressed by [<HI>the circumcised</HI>] and those without by [<HI>the uncircumcised.</HI>] <HI>Rom:</HI> 15. 8. &amp; 3. 30. <HI>Eph:</HI> 2,11. <HI>Judg:</HI> 14. 3. &amp; 15.18.1 <HI>Sam</HI> 14.6 &amp; 17.26,36. <HI>Jer</HI> 9,25,26. Hence by proportion Baptisme (which is our Gospel circumcision, Col:2. 11,12.) belongs to the whole visible Church under the new Testament. Actual and personal circumcision was in|deed proper to the males of old, females being but inclusively and virtually circumcised, and so counted of the circumcision: but the Lord hath taken away that difference now, and appointed Bap|tisme to be personally applied to both sexes: <HI>Act:</HI> 8. 12. <HI>&amp;</HI> 16. 15. <HI>Gal:</HI> 3 28. So that every particular member of the visible Church is now a subject of Baptisme. We conclude therefore that Baptisme pertaines to the whole visible Church, and to all and every one therein, and to no other.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>That they are members of the same Church with their parents,</HI> appears; 1. Because so were <HI>Isaac</HI> and <HI>Ishmael</HI> of <HI>Abrahams</HI> Family-church, and the children of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Proselytes</HI> of <HI>Isra|els</HI> National Church: and there is the same reason for <HI>children</HI> now to be of the <HI>same Congregational Church</HI> with their parents. Christ's care for children, and the scope of the Covenant, as to obligation unto Order and Government, is as great now, as then. 2. Either they are members of the same Church with their pa|rents, or of some other Church, or Non-members: But neither of the latter; therefore the former. That they are not Non|members, was before proved in <HI>Propos.</HI> 2. <HI>Partic.</HI> 3. and if not members of the <HI>same Church</HI> with their parents, then <HI>of no other.</HI> For if there be not reason sufficient to state them members of that Church where their parents have covenanted for them, and where ordinarily they are baptized and do inhabit, then much less is there reason to make them members of any other: and so they will be members of no particular Church at all; and it was be|fore
<PB N="16" REF="000068_0031_0F9F1B403A769168">
shewed, that there is no ordinary and orderly standing estate of Church-members, but in some particular Church. 3. <HI>The same covenant-act is accounted the act of parent and childe:</HI> but the parents covenanting rendred himself a member of this particular Church; Therefore so it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">enders the childe also. How can chil|dren come in with and by their parents, and yet come into a Church, wherein and whereof their parents are not, so as that they should be of one Church, and the parents of another? 4. Children are in <HI>an orderly and regular state:</HI> for they are in that state, wherein the order of Gods Covenant, and his institu|tion therein, hath placed them; they being members by vertue of the Covenant of God. To say their standing is disorderly, would be to impute disorder to the order of Gods Covenant, or irregularity to the Rule. Now all will grant it to be most order|ly and regular, that every Christian be a member in some par|ticular Church, and in that particular Church, where his regular habitation is; which to children usually is, where their parents are. If the Rule call them to remove, then their membership ought orderly to be translated to the Church, whither they re|move. Again, order requires that <HI>the childe,</HI> and the <HI>power of government over the childe,</HI> should go together. It would <HI>bring shame</HI> and confusion for the childe to be from under government, <HI>Prov.</HI> 29.15. and Parental and Ecclesiastical government con|curring, do mutually help and strengthen each other.

<P><HI>These Adult persons are not therefore to be admitted to full Communion, meerly because they are and continue members, with|out such further qualifications, as the Word of God requireth there|unto.</HI></P>
<P>The truth hereof is plain, 1.

See the like in <HI>Ezra</HI> 6. 21,22. 3. Though all members of the Church are subjects of Baptism, they and their children, yet all members may not partake of the Lords Supper, as is further manifest from the different nature of Baptism and the Lords Supper. Baptism firstly and properly seals <HI>covenant-holiness,</HI> as circumcision did, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. <HI>Church-membership,</HI> Rom: 15. 8. <HI>planting into Christ, Rom.</HI> 6. and so members, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s such,</HI> are the subjects of Baptism, <HI>Matth.</HI>28.19.

It seems not rational, that those who are not themselves fit for all Ordinances, should have such an influence referring to all Ordinances, as Voting in Election of Officers, Admission and Censures of Members, doth import.

<P><HI>These children are partakers of that which is the main ground of baptizing any children whatsoever,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Argum:</HI> 1.</NOTE> and neither the parents nor the children do put in any barre to hinder it.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That they partake of that which is the main ground of bapti|zing any,</HI> is clear; Because interest in the Covenant is the main ground of title to Baptism, and this these children have. 1. <HI>In|terest in the covenant is the main ground of title to Baptism;</HI> for so in the Old Testament this was the ground of title to Circumci|sion, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.7. 9,10,11. to which Baptism now answers, <HI>Col.</HI> 2. 11,12. and in <HI>Acts</HI> 2.38,39 they are on this ground exhorted to <HI>be baptized,</HI> because <HI>the promise</HI> or covenant <HI>was to them and to their children.</HI> That a member or one in covenant, <HI>as such,</HI> is the subject of Baptism, was further cleared before in <HI>Propos.</HI>1. 2. <HI>That these children have interest in the covenant,</HI> appears; Because <HI>if the parent be in covenant, the childe is also:</HI> for the covenant is to pa|rents and <HI>their seed in their generations,</HI> Gen: 17. 7,9. <HI>The pro|mise is to you and to your children, Acts</HI> 2. 39.

For as touching that distinction of <HI>mediate and immediate,</HI> as applied to membership (which some urge) we are to distinguish 1. between the efficient and the es|sence of membership: 2. between the instrumental efficient or means thereof, which is the parents profession, and covenanting; and the principal efficient, which is divine Institution. They may be said to be <HI>mediate</HI> (or rather <HI>mediately</HI>) members, as they become members <HI>by means</HI> of their parents covenanting, as an in|strumental cause thereof: but that doth nothing vary or diminish <HI>the essence</HI> of their membership. For divine Institution giveth or granteth a real and personal membership unto them, as well as unto their parents, and maketh the parent a publick person, and so his act theirs to that end. Hence the essence of membership, <HI>i.e. Covenant-interest, or a place and portion within the visible Church,</HI> is really, properly, personally and immediately the portion of the childe by divine gift and grant. <HI>Josh.</HI> 22.25,27. their <HI>children have

a part in the Lord,</HI> as well as themselves. <HI>A part in the Lord</HI> there, and <HI>Church-membership</HI> (Or <HI>membership in Israel</HI>) are terms equi|valent. Now <HI>the children</HI> there, and <HI>a part in the Lord,</HI> are <HI>Sub|ject</HI> and <HI>Adjunct,</HI> which nothing comes between, so as to sever the Adjunct from the Subject; therefore they are <HI>immediate subjects</HI> of that Adjunct or <HI>immediate members.</HI> Again, their visible in|graffing into Christ the head, and so into the Church his body, is sealed in their Baptism: but in ingraffing nothing comes be|tween the graft and the stock: Their union is immediate; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ence they are immediately inserted into the visible Church, or imme|diate members thereof.

For the act of the parent (their publick person) is accounted theirs, and they are said to <HI>enter into covenant, Deut.</HI>29. 11,12. So that what is it that children want unto an actual, compleat, proper, absolute and immediate membership? (so far as these terms may with any propriety or perti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ecy be applied to the matter in hand) Is it <HI>Covenant-interest,</HI> which is the <HI>formalis ratio</HI> of membership? No, they are in co|venant. Is it <HI>divine grant and institution,</HI> which is the <HI>principal efficient?</HI> No: he hath clearly declared himself that he grants un|to the children of his people a portion in his Church, and ap|points them to be members thereof.

<P N="3">3. <HI>That their membership still continues in adult age, and censeth not with their infancy,</HI> appears, 1. Because in Scripture persons are <HI>broken off,</HI> onely for notorious sin or incorrigible impenitency and unbelief not for growing up to adult age, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.20. 2. <HI>The Jew-children cir|cumcised</HI> did not cease to be members by growing up, but continued in the Church, and were by virtue of their membership received in infancy, bound unto various duties, and in special unto those solemn personal professions that pertained to adult members, not as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> entring into <HI>a new membership,</HI> but as making a progress in <HI>memberly duties, Deut.</HI>26.2&mdash;10. <HI>&amp;</HI> 16.16,17 with <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.3. 3.

Whence also it follows, that one special end of
<PB N="26" REF="000068_0041_0F9F1B524810B668">
membership received in infancy, is to leave persons under engage|ment to service and subjection to Christ in his Church, when grown up, when they are fittest for it, and have most need of it. 4. There is no ordinary way of cessation of membership but by <HI>Death, Dis|mission, Excommunication,</HI> or <HI>Dissolution of the Society:</HI> none of which is the case of the persons in question. 5. Either they are when ad|ult, members or non-members: if non-members, then a person ad|mitted a member, and sealed by Baptism, not cast out, nor deserving so to be, may (the Church whereof he was still remaining) become a non-member, and out of the Church, and of the unclean world; which the Scripture acknowledgeth not.
