<P>WE find in the 66<HI>th.</HI> Ver&s;e of this Chapter, That many of CHRIST's fol|lowers for&s;ook him, and went away; they turn'd their backs upon him &amp; became Apo&s;tates; The occa&s;ion thereof we find in the forego|ing Ver&s;es; they &s;tumbled at his Doctrine:
<PB N="2" REF="002351_0003_0FDB2E9227D41738">
they were prejudiced at his Sermon: He had told them in the foregoing Ver&s;es, that <HI>He was the Bread of life</HI>; and that unle&s;s <HI>they ate His Fle&s;h and drank His Blood, they had no life:</HI> That is, they neither had any Spiritual Life then, nor &s;hould they have Eternal Life here|after. They taking the&s;e words to be meant Carnally &amp; Literally, not Spiritually, &s;tumb|led thereat. And when Je&s;us &s;aw that &s;ome of His own Di&s;ciples mi&s;under&s;tood him, He proceeds to Enlighten them, v. 61. telling 'em He meant eating of His Fle&s;h &amp; drinking of His Blood, to be after a <HI>Spiritual manner, Ver.</HI> 63. That it is <HI>the Spirit that quickneth</HI> and not the Fle&s;h; and His words were Spiritual, <HI>i. e.</HI> to be under&s;tood after a Spiritual manner. After which He told them he knew well that there were &s;ome that did not receive the Truth, and would not Believe, <HI>Ver.</HI> 64. And in <HI>Ver.</HI> 65.

Upon this they Revolted, and this was the occa&s;ion of their Back&s;liding; therefore it is &s;aid, <HI>From

<P>Upon this the Lord JESUS took occa&s;ion to &s;peak to His Di&s;ciples, that is <HI>the Twelve</HI> (being full of Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion,) He &s;eeing many turn their backs, turned about to tho&s;e who remained; and in a very pa|thetical Heart-affecting manner, &s;aith, <HI>Will ye go away al&s;o</HI>?

<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> That there is no help to be had for poor needy Sinners, but in JESUS CHRIST. <HI>Act 4.12.</HI> Salvation is to be had in no other.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002351_0005_0FDB2E950C221058">There are Two PROPOSITIONS.</P>
<P>PROP I. <HI>Sinners are Poor Needy Creatures.</HI> I intend Unconverted Sinners: All men are &s;uch by Nature; the condition of all and every man by Nature is, POOR, MISERA|BLE, BLIND, AND NAKED.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Men &s;tand in need of Pardoning Mercy.</HI> They have need to have their Sins Pardoned. Sins are called <HI>Debts, Mat.</HI> 6.12. What <HI>Luke</HI> calls <HI>Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es</HI> or Sins, in <HI>Luk.</HI> 11.4. <HI>Matthew</HI> calls <HI>Debts</HI>; to note that Sin is a Debt. How many Sins a man is guilty of, &s;o many are his Debts: and poor Man is mi&s;erably Bank|rupt, and not able to pay &s;o much as one of the lea&s;t of them! So likewi&s;e man is a poor guilty Criminal &amp; Malefactor, Condemned to die; Joh. 3.18. <HI>He that believeth not is con|demned already.</HI> And there is no way to e&s;cape but by Pardoning Mercy: They &s;tand in need of Ju&s;tifying Grace to Ab&s;olve, Ac|quit and Di&s;charge them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Men &s;tand in need of Renewing &amp; Sancti|fying Grace.</HI> Natural men are Carnal, Cor|rupt, Unholy ones, &s;uch as God can have no plea&s;ure in, <HI>Jer.</HI> 44.4. Sin is abominable in the &s;ight of the Lord; God hates it, &amp; man becau&s;e of Sin is &s;uch in the &s;ight of God too, Job 15.6. &mdash; <HI>Much more abominable is man.</HI> Hence they &s;tand in need of Clean&s;ing and

Purifying, which is done by Converting and Sanctifying Grace; which is wrought by the Operation of the Spirit &amp; Application of the Blood of Chri&s;t Therefore you read of be|ing wa&s;hed in His Blood, Rev. 1.5 <HI>Unto Him that loved us, and wa&s;hed us from our Sins in His own Blood.</HI> And 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.7, 9. He not only <HI>Forgives,</HI> but <HI>Clean&s;es from Sin.</HI> This is done by the Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Son of God. Men &s;tand in need of being Purified &amp; made Holy, without which they cannot enter into the Beatifick Pre&s;ence of God; Heb. 12.14. <HI>For without Holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI> As it was of old, a man Ceremonially Un|clean might not enter into the Camp and Congregation of God's People, <HI>Deut</HI> 23.10. So men Spiritually Unclean cannot enter Heaven, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.5. No unclean thing enters there.</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>Sinners &s;tand in need of Peace, true Peace &amp; Comfort.</HI> A Peace and Security many of them have; Amos 6.1. <HI>Sinners in Zion are at ea&s;e</HI>: they cry, <HI>Peace, peace to them&s;elves</HI>: but this is a Peace that they were better without than with: Tis a fal&s;e Peace, a carnal Peace;</P>
<P>Peace that mu&s;t be broken and taken away from them, el&s;e <HI>Wo to them</HI>; Tis a Peace that's from a &s;pirit of Self-flattery &amp; from Satan, (he blinds mens Eyes and keeps them under Delu&s;ion) and not a Peace that comes

Chri&s;tle&s;s Souls can have no good well-grounded Peace, <HI>Joh.</HI> 16. <HI>ult. I&s;a.</HI> 57.19 God cau&s;es Peace, but God never &s;peaks Peace to &s;uch who are Un|converted, Impenitent Unbelieving Sinners.

When a Per&s;on is &s;ick, many times Phy&s;icians are called, but they are non-plu&s;h'd, know not what the Malady is; and when they do, it may be, cannot help.

<P><PB N="20" REF="002351_0021_0FDB2EBCDFCE1700">To Conclude with &s;ome Directions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Get pinched with the &s;en&s;e of your Wants.</HI> The Prodigal never comes to any &s;erious Thoughts of returning to his Fathers hou&s;e, till pinched with Hunger, <HI>Luke</HI> XV. So here, Whatever men thinks of it, they will never be truly willing to go to Chri&s;t for help in a right way, till they are &s;tarved out of hou&s;e and home.

Study your own Hearts, Reflect upon your Lives, dwell much in Meditation upon your Natural mi&s;erable State and Condition, till you feel that &s;en&s;e <HI>That there is no Hope,</HI> you'l never go to Chri&s;t for help upon Go&s;pel Terms, <HI>Mat.</HI> 9.12 The <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> look'd not to the <HI>Brazen Serpent,</HI> till they found them&s;elves &s;tung by the <HI>Fiery Ser|pents.</HI> Now, Oh!

A drop of that Blood which once they could trample under foot, is more worth than the whole World to them now. Sen&s;e of Sin, Mi&s;ery, Danger, &amp; Fear of Hell, will make a &s;aviour Precious.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Go Humbly if you would go Acceptably.</HI> Go Poor, &amp; Wretched, and Empty. Oh! Don't think to carry any thing with you that will Recommend you to God: I&s;a. 55.1. Go <HI>without

<P N="3">3. <HI>Look earne&s;tly to God to Prepare &amp; Lead you.</HI> If He don't undertake and lead you, you'l never find the way to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 42.16 Tell the Lord, He can do it, He has done it for others, and He can do it for you. Plead hard Night &amp; Day: 'Tis a matter of greate&s;t Moment, highe&s;t Con&s;equence. Your poor Souls and all lies at &s;take. Don't think that God will be&s;tow Grace upon the Negligent and Carele&s;s Sinner, or upon the Cold&punc; and Indifferent Seeker. The little Pains that &s;ome men take, is an Argument that they are like to mi&s;s of God's Grace &amp; Mercy.</P>
