<Q><BIBL><HI>That pa&s;&s;age of In&s;piration, which I take for the motto of this Di&s;cour&s;e, is in the Book of</HI> E&s;ther, <HI>Chap. viii. Ver. 11.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Wherein the King granted the Jews which <HI>were</HI> in every city, to gather them&s;elves together, and to &s;tand for their life, to de&s;troy, to &s;tay, and to cau&s;e to peri&s;h all the power of the people and province that would a&s;&s;ault them.</P></Q>

<P>_SUCH is the accur&s;ed nature of lawle&s;s ambi|tion, that the greate&s;t misfortunes of kingdoms, and &s;tates, as well as of le&s;&s;er communities, and individuals, have ari&s;en from, and are owing to an in&s;atiate lu&s;t of power in me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of abilities, and influence.</P>
<P>Voracious like the grave, they can never have enough, <HI>i. e.</HI> of power and wealth: And are therefore prompted on by re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ires, to &s;eek the means of accumulating the&s;e, and that by expedients, however profitable to them&s;elves, are de|&s;tructive to their country.</P>
<P>Such fal&s;e, de&s;igning, and dete&s;table patriots have in every age, nation, and country in the world, at one time or other, led their blind confiding country-men, into the very jaws of &s;lavery, va&s;&s;alage, and ruin.</P>
<P>The lu&s;t of power has in all nations, combined the wor&s;t pa&s;&s;ions of the human heart, and the wor&s;t projects of the human mind, in league again&s;t the liberties of mankind.&mdash;

From hence, has ari&s;en &s;o many ab&s;olute monarchies in the world, that have con&s;idered and treated their &s;ubjects, as then ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le; that have reduced thou&s;ands and millions, to a brutal va&s;&s;alage, unworthy the rational and immortal nature of man; to gratify the in&s;atiable ambition, and luxury of a crafty de&s;igning few.</P>
<P>Yea, &s;uch often, has been the influence, of a combined in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o of courtiers and &s;tate-jobbers, that the reigning mo|narch, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gh naturally of a compa&s;&s;ionate and benevolent h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rt, has been by &s;uch in&s;truments, brought into a &s;tate of <HI>magnificent &s;ervitude,</HI> and <HI>&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ended va&s;&s;alage</HI>; and made ac|ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ary to the blacke&s;t de&s;ings.</P>

<P>The&s;e de&s;igning men, this kind of patriots, always lay their plan with a view, to &s;culk behind the king's authority; if <HI>their</HI> oppre&s;&s;ion rou&s;es the nation to a&s;&s;ert their right, to &s;creen them from de&s;erved vengeance; or if their &s;overeign's eyes &s;hould be opened to di&s;cover <HI>their</HI> black de&s;igns, and his own, and the nations true intere&s;t, and his ears to better councils, to depo&s;e, or de&s;troy him.&mdash;In a word, if they &s;ee they are like to be ca&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, and the plunder of mank<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d wre&s;ted from their unrighteous hands, and he will not give them his authority, to &s;uck the blood and trea&s;ure of their fellow-&s;ubjects, they aim that his own &s;hall pay for it.</P>

<P>As this monarchy had gained the &s;ummit of its glory, ex|tent and wealth, it was now at peace with its neighbours a|broad, yet luxury and riot began to rage within.

<P>It is very unlikely that a royal <HI>decree</HI> &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to procure civil re&s;pect, to the prime <HI>mini&s;ter,</HI> and &s;o great a court favourite; and it is as unlikely that a man of <HI>Morde|cai's</HI> good &s;en&s;e and piety, would deny it to him&mdash;but the HOMAGE that was decreed him, no doubt was that of <HI>wor&s;hip.</HI> This, a croud of <HI>fawning, expecting, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ringing</HI> SYCO|PHANTS <HI>paid him</HI>; but <HI>Mordecai</HI> bowed not.
