<HEAD>A SERIOUS EXPOSTULATION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN the American Daily Adverti&s;er, and other public papers, are in&s;erted Debates of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the United States, on the 28th of November la&s;t, &s;ome &s;peeches or animad|ver&s;ions of two or three of the &s;outhern delegates, on the pre&s;entation of what is there &s;tiled "a pa|per purporting to be a memorial re&s;pecting the abo|lition of &s;lavery, which in the opinion of the &s;aid delegates, and divers others, was declared to be an application uncon&s;titutional, and of mi&s;chievous con&s;equences, as it would only tend to render the Negroes unhappy, and excite them to in&s;urrections in tho&s;e &s;tates where they were mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be retained; and that even the publication of a <HI>fanatical memorial</HI> in the new&s;-papers, might have a fatal effect in di&s;turbing the pre&s;ent excellent har|mony of the union; for the people of the &s;outhern &s;tates may be led thereby to &s;uppo&s;e, that this me|morial is before Congre&s;s, and will be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed dur|ing the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, it is therefore the more ne|ce&s;&s;ary

to undeceive them, by publi&s;hing the con|trary, and by expunging the entry from the jour|nals."</P>
<P>Having believed it my religious duty to addre&s;s that memorial to Congre&s;s, and that in &s;o doing, I was really influenced by the Catholic principle of uni|ver&s;al good-will to men, and &s;incerely de&s;irous of promoting that <HI>excellent harmony and union,</HI> which is founded on the &s;olid ba&s;is of impartial liberty and common right, I may acknowledge it is far from being a matter of indifference to me to find, in the above-cited publication, &s;o little regard paid to this great fundamental of the public weal; by men cho&s;en and entru&s;ted to fill a &s;tation &s;o very im|portant, who ought and may be &s;uppo&s;ed, on a &s;ubject of &s;o intere&s;ting and exten&s;ive concernment, to &s;peak their real &s;entiments, unbia&s;&s;ed by any &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;e; I have been therefore led I tru&s;t, by the &s;ame di&s;intere&s;ted and Chri&s;tian motive, which induced me to make the application in que&s;|tion, to enter into a clo&s;e &s;elf-examination and recon&s;ideration of the tenor of my &s;aid memorial, left through an unguarded warmth of zeal, I might have given occa&s;ion to tho&s;e not well-affected to that divine precept and perfect rule of univer&s;al equity, enjoined by the highe&s;t authority, <HI>what&s;o|ever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o unto them</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. vii.31.</NOTE>&mdash;to &s;tamp the righteous and liberal aim and de&s;ign of my memorial, with the oppro|brious &s;tigma of <HI>fanatici&s;m</HI>; and as far as I have

been capable of an impartial &s;crutiny, I do not find any thing therein contained more ju&s;tly me|riting &s;o invidious a cen&s;ure, than what may be found in divers publicacions of Congre&s;s on the &s;ame &s;ubject; &s;ome of which I have thought pro|per to &s;elect and bring into view, beginning with the following remarkable language of the a&s;&s;ociati|on entered into the 20th of October, 1774.</P>
<P>"And therefore we do for our&s;elves and the in|habitants of the &s;everal colonies whom we repre&s;ent, firmly agree and a&s;&s;ociate under the &s;acred tics of virtue, honor, and love of our country, as follows:</P>

God, the Creator of all, requires, that a true and impartial judgment be formed of the mea&s;ures leading to &s;uch oppo&s;ition; and of the cau&s;es by which it has been provoked, or can in any degree be ju&s;tified, that neither affection on the one hand, nor re&s;entment on the other, being permitted to give a wrong bias to rea&s;on, it may be enabled to take a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate view of all circum&s;tances, and to &s;ettle the public conduct on the &s;olid foundations of wi&s;|dom and ju&s;tice. From coun&s;els thus tempered ari&s;e the pure&s;t hopes of the divine favor, the firme&s;t encouragement to the parties engaged, and the &s;tronge&s;t recommendations of their cau&s;e to the re&s;t of mankind, &amp;c."</P>

<P>And in the Declaration of Independence is in&s;erted re&s;pecting the King as follows:</P>
<P>"He has plundered our &s;eas, ravaged our coa&s;ts, burnt our towns, and de&s;troyed the lives of our people. He is at this time tran&s;porting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works

of death, de&s;olation and tyranny, already begun with circum&s;tances of cruelty and perfidy &s;earcely paralleled in the mo&s;t barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the head of a civilized nation. He has excited dome&s;tic in&s;urrections among&s;t us."</P>
<P>And here I think it may be proper to mention, that under permi&s;&s;ion of Divine Providence, the mea&s;ure which both Britains and Americans had long dealt to the natives of Africa, they were in like manner &s;uffered reciprocally to mete out to each other, by burning towns, &amp;c. captivating their inha|bitants, &s;towing them into gaols and pri&s;on &s;hips, to linger under agonizing pains unto cruel death; at this &s;tage of affairs Congre&s;s re&s;olve at different times on public fa&s;ting and prayers, wherein they acknowledge the &s;uperintendence of an all wi&s;e Providence, and the obligations our nation was un|der to reform from its &s;ins and implore his merci|ful interpo&s;ition, to remove tho&s;e calamities from the land, and avert tho&s;e de&s;olating judgments with which we were threatened. See Journal June 12, 1775, and March 16, 1776.</P>
<P>In a pamphlet, intitled, "Ob&s;ervations on the American Revolution," publi&s;hed by order of Con|gre&s;s in 1779, the following &s;entiments are declared to the world, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The great principle (of government) is and ever will remain in force, <HI>that men are by nature free:</HI> as accountable to him that made them, they mu&s;t be &s;o; and &s;o long as we have any idea of Divine Ju&s;tice, we mu&s;t a&s;&s;ociate that of human freedom. Whether men can part with their liberty, is among
<PB N="9" REF="025821_0008_0FCF278A80D47E70">
the que&s;tions which have exerci&s;ed the able&s;t writ|ers; but it is concluded on all hands, that the right to be free can never be alienated&mdash;&s;till le&s;s is it practicable for one generation to mortgage the privileges of another."</P>
<P>After the laborious productions of the wi&s;dom of this country, manife&s;ted to the world by the declarations and addre&s;&s;es from which the forego|ing are extracted, with others of a &s;imilar nature, demon&s;trating the natural rights of men in &s;o clear a manner, the following appears to have been adopted as the then faith of the nation, in the de|claration of independence the 4th of July 1776, viz. "We hold the&s;e truths to be &s;elf evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among&s;t the&s;e are life, liberty, and the pur&s;uit of happine&s;s."</P>
<P>At the time of entering into the &s;olemn league and covenant (20th October 1774) to vindicate the rights of man, and promote national righteou&s;ne&s;s, had any one declared as their opinion that it was of mi&s;chievous con&s;equence, tending to render un|happy the helple&s;s victims of de&s;potic tyranny, and excite to in&s;urrection, or attempted to enforce as a political creed, &s;o dete&s;table a po&s;ition, as that a happy <HI>national harmony and union</HI> depended on &s;e|curing to one cla&s;s of men, the power and privi|lege of en&s;laving and exerci&s;ing an imperious lord|&s;hip over another part of God's rational creation, &s;uch per&s;on, though he might not have been &s;tig|matized

as a fanatic&mdash;would doubtle&s;s have been in danger of being pro&s;cribed as an enemy to his coun|try, and a traitor to the common cau&s;e of equal li|berty: now feeling &s;uch a weight on my &s;pirit, I am thereby impelled, by a &s;en&s;e of duty to the So|vereign of the Univer&s;e, and the dictates of huma|nity, to open my mouth for the dumb, in the cau&s;e of &s;uch as are appointed to de&s;truction; and if this is fanatici&s;m, enthu&s;ia&s;m, &amp;c. may the Almighty grant a double portion to what I ever experienced, if it be his holy will! I cannot u&s;e the carnal &s;word in my country's defence, I believe that weapon for a Chri&s;tian to be unlawful, yet I tru&s;t I &s;hall with the weapons that are to me lawful in the cau&s;e of my country, manife&s;t as much firmne&s;s and &s;tabi|lity, though it be but in the exerci&s;e of one talent, as tho&s;e who think them&s;elves ju&s;tified in the u&s;e of other and greater talents: and therefore, as I do indeed feel alarmed, when I con&s;ider that the &s;o|lemn profe&s;&s;ions &s;o lately made in time of extremity and danger, and held up as the national faith, &s;hould &s;o &s;oon on this important occa&s;ion &s;eem to be regarded as mere <HI>tricks of &s;tate,</HI> what can be thought will be the i&s;&s;ue? may it not be con&s;ider|ed like trifling with omnipotence?</P>
<P>I crave your patience, my fellow citizens&mdash;I am intere&s;ted in the welfare of this country; but I can|not have any conception that this nation will long fare well, when after &s;uch declamations again&s;t Bri|tain on account of the de&s;potic mea&s;ures pur&s;ued by her admini&s;tration, the &s;pirit of tyranny and op|pre&s;&s;ion is &s;uffered &s;o readily to prevail in the coun|cils

of American rulers, to a degree in no in&s;tance exceeded by Britain; on which head I venture to appeal to the witne&s;s for God in your own brea&s;ts, which will undoubtedly &s;hew the national iniquity is the &s;ame, whether it proceed from Acts of Con|vention, or receive its &s;trength from the counte|nance of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Had Congre&s;s done as much towards removing this national guilt, as by the tenor of their own vote they have power to do, there is no doubt with me, but that it would at lea&s;t have given a very powerful check, if not a total &s;top to the odious traffic, notwith&s;tanding the plea of re&s;triction in the con&s;titution of the general government: but whe|ther you will hear or forbear, I think it my duty to tell you plainly, that I believe the blood of the &s;lain, and the oppre&s;&s;ion exerci&s;ed in Africa, pro|moted by Americans, and in this country al&s;o, will &s;tick to the &s;kirts of every individual of your body, who exerci&s;e the powers of Legi&s;lation, and do not exert their talents to clear them&s;elves of this abomi|nation, when they &s;hall be arraigned before the tre|mendous bar of the judgment-&s;eat of him who will not fail to do right, in rendering unto every man his due; even him who early declared, "at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man;" before whom the natural black &s;kin of the body will never occa&s;ion &s;uch degradation. I de&s;ire to approach you with proper and due re&s;pect, in the temper of a Chri&s;tian, and the firmne&s;s of a veteran American Freeman, to plead the cau&s;e of injured innocence, and open my mouth for my
<PB N="12" REF="025821_0011_0FCF2791037D5368">
oppre&s;&s;ed brethren, who cannot open theirs for them&s;elves. I a&s;k no pecuniary advantage for my|&s;elf, neither po&s;t nor pen&s;ion. I feel the &s;weets of American Liberty&mdash;I tru&s;t I am &s;en&s;ible of, and thankful for the favor; and am not ea&s;y to par|take of mine &s;o partially, and &s;ee, hear and know of my brethren and fellow mortals being &s;o arbi|trarily and cruelly deprived of theirs, and not en|ter my prote&s;t. I de&s;ire to have this favor and ble&s;&s;ing continued to my&s;elf and po&s;terity, and can|not but view the tenure, both to my&s;elf and coun|trymen, as very precarious, while a plea is founded on the general con&s;titution, in bar of the rights of man; and the equal di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice being confirmed, that the views of a righteous govern|ment would be, to promote the welfare of man|kind univer&s;ally, as well tho&s;e of other nations, as the &s;ubjects or citizens of its own; and therefore, that it is obligatory on the United States, to pre|vent the citizens thereof injuring the inhabitants of Africa, as tho&s;e of one &s;tate the citizens of ano|ther: and I doubt not in the lea&s;t, if Africa was in a &s;ituation to &s;end fleets and armies here to re|taliate, but Congre&s;s would &s;oon devi&s;e ways, with|out violating the Con&s;titution, to prevent our citi|zens from aggravating them. The almo&s;t daily ac|counts I have of the inhumanity perpetrated in the&s;e &s;tates on this race of men, di&s;tre&s;&s;es me night and day, and brings the &s;ubject of the Slave Trade with more pre&s;&s;ure on my &s;pirit; and I believe I feel a mea&s;ure of the &s;ame obligation that the Prophet did when he was ordered to cry aloud, &s;pare not, li&s;t up thy
<PB N="13" REF="025821_0012_0FCF2792A4166740">
voice like a trumpet, and &s;hew my people their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, and the hou&s;e of Jacob their &s;ins. And here I think I can &s;hew, that our nation are revolt|ing from the law of God, the law of rea&s;on and hu|manity, and the ju&s;t principles of government; and with rapid &s;trides e&s;tabli&s;hing tyranny and oppre&s;&s;i|on; to prove which, I need do no more than oppo&s;e the pre&s;ent conduct of the nation, to that part of it which I have now brought to your view, from the former journals of Congre&s;s, and then mention the &s;anction the African Slave Trade at this time has from the general government; in proof of which I may refer to the condition on which Congre&s;s ac|cepted the ce&s;&s;ion of the We&s;tern Territory of North Carolina, viz. <HI>That no regulation made or to be made &s;hall tend to emancipate &s;laves.</HI></P>
<P>I am concerned that the leaders of the people may not cau&s;e them to err, or &s;trengthen them in error; the plea now is by &s;tate Legi&s;lators, as well as other cla&s;&s;es of citizens, and even tho&s;e abandon|ed dealers in the per&s;ons of men, that Congre&s;s au|thorizes the traffic as I my&s;elf now believe you vir|tually do.</P>
<P>If your di&s;approbation of this trade as a body was publicly known to be &s;incere, I believe it would have a good effect; and if you are &s;o it is my judg|ment the people has a right to know and expect it from you. I am per&s;uaded, nine tenths of the ci|tizens of the United States reprobate the African Trade, and con&s;ider every &s;lave imported an injury to the public; and that they repo&s;e confidence in your wi&s;dom as guardians of the nation, to prevent
<PB N="14" REF="025821_0013_0FCF279943862D08">
its injury; and that herein you betray the tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in you, which is indeed a great and weighty tru&s;t, even to do that which of right ought to be done by the nation; therefore it requires on this ve|ry important &s;ubject your deep and &s;erious con&s;ide|ration, what you can do &s;o as to obtain the favor of Divine Providence to this land, which I do indeed believe will be marked with &s;omething very different, if &s;uch an inhuman traffic is continued.</P>
<P>Humane petitions have been pre&s;ented, to ex|cite in Congre&s;s benevolent feelings for the &s;uffer|ings of our fellow citizens under cruel bondage to Turks and Algerines, and that the national power and influence might be exerted for their relief; with this virtuous application I unite, but lament that any of my countrymen, who are di&s;tingui&s;hed as men eminently qualified for public &s;tation, &s;hould be &s;o en&s;laved by illiberal prejudice, as to treat with contempt a like &s;olicitude for another cla&s;s of men &s;till more grievou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I pro&s;e&s;s freely, and am willing my profe&s;&s;ion was known over the world, that I feel the calls of hu|manity as &s;trong towards an African in America, as to an American in Algiers, both being my bre|thren; e&s;pecially as I am informed the Algerine treats his &s;lave with more humanity; and I believe the &s;in of oppre&s;&s;ion on the part of the Ameri|can, is greate&s;t in the &s;ight of the father of the fa|mily of mankind.</P>
<P>I hope &s;ome will excu&s;e my in&s;erting, in this apo|logetic expo&s;tulation, a few texts of &s;cripture as they revive&mdash;I tru&s;t there are &s;ome of our rulers yet

<P>That I may not be thought to tre&s;pa&s;s on your patience on this momentous &s;ubject, after repeating my &s;pecial reque&s;t, that you would without delay exert your power and influence to fru&s;trate the ava|ricious purpo&s;e of tho&s;e mercenaries, who are per|haps now on their voyage from Liverpool to Afri|ca, to bring to &s;ome of the Southern &s;tates cargoes of innocent human beings into cruel, unconditional bondage; the grounds I have for this apprehen&s;i|on, are I believe not unknown to &s;ome among you. I will draw towards a conclu&s;ion, with a quotation from the addre&s;s of Congre&s;s to the A&s;&s;embly of Jamaica, dated 26th of July 1775.</P>

<P>OBSERVING in the Journals of Congre&s;s, giv|en us in the la&s;t Gazette, mention is made of the reading and returning a Memorial &s;ub&s;cribed by Warner Mifflin: As the de&s;ign of publi&s;hing tho&s;e Journals is, I pre&s;ume, to give their con&s;tituents the means of forming an opinion of the doings of their repre&s;entatives, I therefore reque&s;t the enclo&s;ed copy of &s;aid Memorial may have a place in the next Gazette, as without it, no &s;afe opinion can be formed upon that article in the Journals. The Memoriali&s;t has been well known to many, in almo&s;t every &s;tate in the union, to be a man of good &s;en&s;e and &s;olid di&s;cernment, of a plentiful e&s;tate and unfullied character, a citizen of one of the &s;outhern &s;tates, and a firm friend to the uni|ver&s;al liberty of mankind, both in principle and practice. Whether the &s;entiments in that Memo|rial could con&s;i&s;tently warrant the epithet <HI>fanatical,</HI> from any one Member of Congre&s;s, who profe&s;|&s;eth to believe in the moral government of the world by a Supreme Being, the reader will judge.</P>

<HEAD>THE MEMORIAL OF WARNER MIFFLIN <HI>To the</HI> PRESIDENT, SENATE <HI>and</HI> HOUSE <HI>of</HI> RE|PRESENTATIVES <HI>of the</HI> UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>He that ruleth over Men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God.</Q>
<BIBL>2d Samuel, xxiii. 3.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAVING for a long time felt my mind im|pre&s;&s;ed with a religious engagement on your account, and a belief, that if mea&s;ures are not tak|en to redre&s;s the wrongs, and alleviate the &s;uffer|ings and oppre&s;&s;ions of the African race in the&s;e &s;tates, the Almighty will manife&s;t his di&s;plea&s;ure in a more con&s;picuous manner than has yet appear|ed; the con&s;ideration whereof excites me, in his fear, earne&s;tly to &s;olicit, and &s;olemnly to warn you, to exert your power and influence, that right and ju&s;tice may be done in this important ca&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>I have al&s;o been affected with the following de|claration of the Prophet, Ezek. iii. 20.</HI> When a righte|ous man doth turn from his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and commit iniquity, and I lay a &s;tumbling-block before him, he &s;hall die; becau&s;e thou ha&s;t not given him warning, he &s;hall die in his &s;in, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s which he hath done &s;hall not he remembered, but his blood will I require at thine hand.</P>
<P>21. Neverthele&s;s, if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous &s;in not, and he doth not &s;in, he &s;hall &s;urely live, becau&s;e he is warned, al&s;o thou ha&s;t delivered thy &s;oul.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="025821_0019_0FCF27A483A9F530">Now I cannot view the declaration made by the fir&s;t Congre&s;s, in &s;ub&s;tance to amount to any thing &s;hort of a &s;olemn covenant entered into, with the God of heaven and the whole earth, viz <HI>We hold the&s;e truths to be &s;elf-evident, that all men are cre|ated equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, among which are life, liberty,</HI> &amp;c. and which remains obligatory on the pre&s;ent Congre&s;s &s;o to con&s;ider. How then have tho&s;e rights become alienated, that Americans &s;hould be permitted to continue to ravage the coa&s;t of Africa, thereby promoting murder, pillaging, plundering and burning its towns, and en&s;laving its inhabitants?&mdash;And in the United States, while &s;ome of tho&s;e very men, who perhaps with their own hands &s;ub&s;cribed the afore&s;aid declaration, re|main in the &s;upreme Legi&s;lature,' that avaricious men &s;hould be permitted to pa&s;s through the coun|try, &s;teal, buy, traffic, barter and exchange the blacks, as though they were indeed brute bea&s;ts, &s;eparating hu&s;band from wife, parents from chil|dren, even mothers from infant babes, yea, from all that is dear to men in this world, except life, and indeed that al&s;o, as there are divers in&s;tances of their being murdered; others in iron &s;etters, huddled into gaol until the number wanted is col|lected, then &s;towed into ve&s;&s;els for tran&s;portation to foreign ports, and &s;old into perpetual &s;lavery, not permitting a parting leave between the neare&s;t ties of nature&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="025821_0020_0FCF27A7535C63F0">My &s;oul now revolts at the infernal crime com|mitted again&s;t innocent per&s;ons, without provoca|tion. Oh let me now be&s;eech you, not to think it too much degradation for you to reflect, was this the lot of one of your beloved delicate wives, your tender babes, or near relatives, how then would you feel!</P>
<P>Do not you with me believe, that there is a God of ju&s;tice, who will finally recompence unto all men according to the fruit of their doings; and that he doth at one view, by his all penetrating eye, behold the actions of men over the face of the globe? if &s;o, how do we think he will look on the rulers of this land, when he beholds many of them faring &s;umptuou&s;ly every day, living in ea&s;e and fulne&s;s, and at the very time that they are invent|ing unto them&s;elves in&s;truments of mu&s;ic, and &s;pending their precious time in vain theatrical and Other amu&s;ements, remember not the afflictions of their &s;uffering African brethren, who in this country may be loaded with irons, under all the pangs of &s;orrow the human heart can be capable of enduring, for no crime whatever, but becau&s;e it plea&s;ed God to &s;uffer them to come into the world with a black &s;kin&mdash;will this not make him your enemy, who is a God that is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons?</P>
<P>I crave your &s;erious attention to this important &s;ubject; and that while you may feel an animated warmth to fill your minds, when engaged re&s;pect|ing the natives of this land, you &s;uffer a turn of
<PB N="7" REF="025821_0021_0FCF27A84AF7ADA0">
thought re&s;pecting the conduct of Americans in Africa, and in this country al&s;o towards Africans, and &s;ee if any &s;avage cruelty of the natives can exceed that of the white people towards the Africans, con&s;idering our &s;uperior advantage of civilization, under the light of the go&s;pel. Let us con&s;ider we are informed, that the mea&s;ure we mete to others is to be meted to us; and likewi&s;e, that we may &s;o conduct, as never to feel the effects (in the full extent) of the declaration of the Almighty for|merly delivered to a highly favored people, in fai|lure of complying with their covenants and en|gagements, viz. <HI>Jerom.</HI> xxxiv.17. <HI>Behold I pro|claim a liberty for you, &s;aith the Lord, to the &s;word, to the famine, and to the pe&s;tilence.</HI></P>
<P>Is there not rea&s;on to acknowledge, that we have &s;een in &s;ome mea&s;ure fulfilled a part of the fir&s;t? are there not traces of the &s;econd? and do we not acknowledge, that all three are &s;ub&s;ervient to Almighty power! and has our nation fulfilled its covenant? Oh! my countrymen and fellow-citi|zens, be &s;erious on this &s;ubject, and allow me the liberty of a free expo&s;tulation with you. I feel for the welfare of my country, and my fellow-citizens, every one of whom I love; and believing my&s;elf eve|ry way equally intere&s;ted with the large&s;t part of your body in the welfare of my country, I hoped you would allow me freely thus far to relieve my pained heart, who feel &s;o much on account of the barba|rous cruelties exerci&s;ed on an unoffending people,

(which I am per&s;uaded you generally have not a full conception of) that under an apprehen&s;ion of duty I have attempted in this manner to addre&s;s you; being, with &s;incere de&s;ires for your welfare,</P>
