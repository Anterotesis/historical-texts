<SALUTE>Reverend Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS you profe&s;s to know the Scriptures, I need not inform you that the Character of young <HI>Elihu</HI> &s;hines in the 32d Chapter of the Book of <HI>Job</HI> with a &s;uperiour Lu&s;tre, above tho&s;e other three Friends that came to conver&s;e with him. The Humili|ty and Mode&s;ty wherewith he fir&s;t addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to them is peculiarly amiable&mdash;<Q>I am young, &s;ays he, and ye are very old, where|fore I was afraid, and dur&s;t not &s;hew you my Opinion&mdash;I &s;aid, Days &s;hould &s;peak, and Multitudes of Years &s;hould teach Wi&s;dom.</Q>&mdash;But knowing by Experience, <Q>that Great Men are not always wi&s;e,</Q> neither do the aged under&s;tand Judgment, he &s;aid, <Q>hearken unto me, and I al&s;o will &s;hew my Opinion</Q>&mdash;And that they might not cen&s;ure him for Ra&s;hne&s;s in &s;peaking, he a&s;&s;ures them, Ver&s;es 11, and 12, that he had well weighed the Matter before he broke Silence&mdash;<Q>Behold I waited for your Words; I gave Ear to your <HI>Rea&s;ons,</HI> whil&s;t you &s;earched out what to &s;ay&mdash;Yea, I attended unto you: and behold there was none of you that convinceth <HI>Job,</HI> or that an&s;wered his Words</Q>&mdash;And that they might not be offended at his <HI>plain Speaking,</HI> or expect that he wou'd be over awed from delivering his Soul, by their Superiority in Age, Learning or Circum&s;tances of Life, in the two la&s;t Ver&s;es of the Chapter, He bold|ly, but hone&s;tly tells them what they were to expect from him&mdash;<Q>Let me not I pray you, accept any Man's Per&s;on, neither let me give flat|tering Titles unto Man, for I know not to give flattering Titles&mdash;In &s;o doing my Maker wou'd &s;oon take me away</Q>&mdash;And its very re|remarkable
<PB N="4" REF="005713_0003_1026CEA6864F0168">
that tho' we are told this young Man's Wrath was kindled a|gain&s;t <HI>Job</HI> and his three Friends, Ver&s;es 2, and 3, and tho' (as it appears from the en&s;uing Chapters) He &s;poke very clo&s;e and cutting Things, yet at the End of the Book, we find no blame laid on him by the Great Heart-Searching God&mdash;whereas the other three are &s;everely reprov'd and com|manded to apply to <HI>Job</HI> for the Benefit of his Prayers.</P>
<P>Animated by and willing to Copy after &s;o bright an Example, I now &s;it down to write you this Letter; in which I wou'd beg Leave to make &s;ome Remarks on your Right Reverend Dioce&s;an's late Charge again&s;t <HI>En|thu&s;ia&s;m</HI>&mdash;Had I continued in my native Country, I &s;hou'd have taken the Freedom to have written to his Lord&s;hip him&s;elf; but as I heard that he was very aged, and probably before this cou'd reach <HI>England,</HI> might be call'd to give up his Account to the great Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of Souls, I thought it mo&s;t advi&s;eable to direct this Letter to you, at who&s;e Reque&s;t, as appears by the Title Page, this Charge was printed&mdash;</P>
<P>It is not my De&s;ign to enter upon a critical Examination of every Pa|ragraph&mdash;I would ob&s;erve in general, that his Lord&s;hip's main De&s;ign from the Beginning to the End of it is to prove, <Q>that the indwelling and in|ward Witne&s;&s;ing of the Spirit in Believers Hearts (if there were ever any &s;uch Things at all) as al&s;o praying and preaching by the Spirit, are all the extraordinary Gifts and Operations of the Holy-Gho&s;t, belonging only to the Apo&s;tolical and primitive Times, and con&s;equently all Pre|tentions to &s;uch Favours in the&s;e la&s;t Days are vain and <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;tical</HI></Q>&mdash;In order to evince this, his Lord&s;hip &s;elects &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of holy Writ, which in his Opinion are mi&s;apply'd by tho&s;e whom his Lord&s;hip is plea&s;ed to &s;tile <HI>modern Enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> and undertakes to &s;hew, Page 11th <Q>that they are to be interpreted chiefly, if not only of the State of the apo&s;tolical and primitive Church, and that they very little if at all relate to the pre|&s;ent State of Chri&s;tians</Q>&mdash;Whether or not, his Lord&s;hip hath &s;ucceeded in his undertaking, will be&s;t appear by a candid and impartial Review of it&mdash;</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Attempt of this Nature which we meet with in his Lord&s;hip's Charge is Page the 12th. His words are the&s;e&mdash;<Q>That I may proceed in a regular Manner, with regard to tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture that I &s;hall &s;elect on this Occa&s;ion, I chu&s;e to begin with the original Promi&s;e of the Spirit, as made by our Lord a little before he left the World&mdash;It occurs in the 14th and 16th Chapters of St. <HI>John's</HI> Go&s;pel; in which he u&s;es the&s;e words: <HI>when the Spirit of truth is come</HI> (whom Chri&s;t had ju&s;t before promis'd to &s;end from the Father) <HI>Chap.</HI> 14<HI>th, ver&s;e</HI> 16<HI>th, He will guide you into all Truth, and be will &s;hew you Things to come</HI></Q>&mdash;And again, <Q><HI>the Comforter, which is the holy Gho&s;t, whom the Father will &s;end in my Name, he &s;hall teach you all Things, and bring all Things to your remembrance what&s;oever I have &s;aid unto you.</HI> It is very clear (proceeds
<PB N="5" REF="005713_0004_1026CEE2233EEF18">
his Lord&s;hip) from the bear recital of the&s;e Words, that as they were &s;poken to the Apo&s;tles, &s;o they Peculiarly belong to the Apo&s;tles them|&s;elves, or to the in&s;pired Per&s;ons in the primitive Church.</Q></P>
<P>But granting that the&s;e Words do belong <HI>peculiarly</HI> to the Apo&s;tles, does it therefore follow, that they do not <HI>at all</HI> belong to their Succe&s;&s;ors, or in common to all Believers upon whom the Ends of the World are come? Were not the Apo&s;tles then Repre&s;entatives of the whole Church? And may not what was &s;poken to them in a <HI>proper degree</HI> be &s;aid to be &s;poken to us and to our Children, and to as many as the Lord our God &s;hall call? Does not his Lord&s;hip confe&s;s, Page 13th <Q>that in one of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages it is added, <HI>that the Father will give you another Com|forter that he may abide with you forever?</HI> And does not his Lord&s;hip allow, page 14th, that in <HI>the large&s;t &s;en&s;e,</HI> in which this may be under&s;tood it is &s;ynonymous with Chri&s;t's Promi&s;e to his Di&s;ciples at his A&s;cen&s;ion, that he would be <HI>with them always even to the End of the World</HI></Q> that is (as him&s;elf explains it) <Q>by the perpetual Pre&s;ence of the holy Spirit, as the Guardian of his Church 'till the end of the World?</Q> But how can Chri&s;t be with his Church by the <HI>perpetual Pre&s;ence</HI> of his Spirit, or how can the holy Spirit <Q>be the Guardian of his Church 'till the End of the World,</Q> unle&s;s it is by opening and bringing all Things to our Remembrance what&s;oever Je&s;us hath &s;aid to us in his revealed Will, guid|ing us thereby into all Truth, and teaching us all Things nece&s;&s;ary to eternal Salvation?</P>
<P>This Promi&s;e, it's true, as his Lord&s;hip ob&s;erves, Page the 15th, <Q>was fulfilled in a mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner by the De&s;cent of the holy Spirit on the Apo&s;tles, and others with them at the Fea&s;t of Penteco&s;t, that is recorded &s;o very particularly in the 2d. Chap. of the <HI>Acts</HI> of the Apo&s;tles. And it is as true (as his Lord&s;hip intimates pag. 16th) that St. <HI>Peter</HI> makes an Application, of the Prophecy of <HI>Joel</HI> to the mira|culous Effu&s;ion of the Spirit on that memorable Occa&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>But does not his Lord&s;hip by intimating that this Promi&s;e of our Lord was wholly compleated on the Day of Penteco&s;t, prove too much? For does it not then follow that no one after the Day of Penteco&s;t was to ex|pect the Holy Gho&s;t to bring all Things to their Remembrance, to teach them all Things, and &s;hew them Things to come? How then could this Promi&s;e be fulfilled in the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> who was converted &s;ometime af|ter? Or how could this remain in the primitive Church in the in&s;pired Per&s;ons, or abide with the Church for ever to the End of the World? And &s;uppo&s;ing the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> does make an Application of the Pro|phecy of <HI>Joel</HI> to the miraculous Effu&s;ion of the Spirit on the Day of Pen|teco&s;t, <HI>Acts</HI> the 2d. Ver&s;es 16th, 17th, &amp;c. Does it therefore follow that this Promi&s;e of our <HI>Saviour</HI> extends no farther than that Day? Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s
<PB N="6" REF="005713_0005_1026CEAA217E0D08">
he any where intimate any &s;uch Thing through his whole Di&s;cour&s;e? Or is it any new Thing for Prophecies to have &s;everal Fulfilments? Is not that Prophecy, <HI>Out of Egypt have I called my Son,</HI> which was originally &s;poken concerning God's <HI>I&s;real,</HI> apply'd by the Evangelist <HI>Matthew,</HI> Ch. 2d Ver&s;e 15th. to the Son of God him&s;elf? And therefore granting that this Promi&s;e was in an extraordinary Degree fulfilled in the Day of Penteco&s;t, how does it follow that it is not now and will be in an ordinary Way fulfilling to the End of the World? And con&s;equently may not this Promi&s;e of our Lord, be pleaded by all his Di&s;ciples for the Indwelling of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, and his inward Teaching, by the In&s;trumentality of his re|vealed Will, now as well as formerly (e&s;pecially &s;ince his Lord&s;hip, Page 15th, clears us from pretending to the Operations of the miraculous Kind) without being cen&s;ured for &s;o doing as <HI>Modern Enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>But this inward Teaching and Indwelling of the Spirit his Lord&s;hip will by no Means allow even the primitive Chri&s;tians to have had in com|mon, and therefore, Page 35th which (I come to next for Method's Sake) He comments upon <Q>another remarkable Scripture that in his Lord&s;hip's Opinion has been mi&s;apply'd to later Ages, and indeed to the pre&s;ent Times by &s;everal <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> but was really peculiar to the Times of the Apo&s;tles. It occurs, &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, Page ibid, in the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle of St. <HI>John,</HI> Chap. 2d. Ver&s;e 20th, 27th. <HI>But ye have an Unction from the Holy One, and ye know all Things</HI>&mdash;<HI>But the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you: But as the &s;ame Anointing teacheth you all Things, and is Truth, and is no Lie; and even as it hath taught you, ye &s;hall abide in him.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This Unction from the Holy One, and this Anointing his Lord&s;hip in five or &s;ix Pages labours to prove, was &s;ome extraordinary Gift re&s;iding in &s;ome particular in&s;pired Per&s;ons, and not in the Believers in general to whom the Apo&s;tle wrote&mdash;But with what Shadow of Argument does his Lord|&s;hip rea&s;on thus? For tho' it be certain (as his Lord&s;hip intimates Page 37th) <Q>that there were &s;everal &s;uch in&s;pired Teachers among the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, who were endow'd with various Gifts of the Spirit, and among them with the Gift of Prayer, and Preaching, and Revelation of the true Sen&s;e of the prophetical Parts of the old Te&s;tament;</Q> yet how does it appear that the&s;e in&s;pired Teachers are the particular Per&s;ons referred to by the Apo&s;tle in this Pa&s;&s;age? If that was the Ca&s;e, would not the Epi&s;tle it&s;elf more properly have been directed to them, as having the Over&s;ight of the Flock? Or is it not probable at lea&s;t that the Apo&s;|tle would have had &s;omething to &s;ay to them as well as to the <HI>little Chil|dren, young Men</HI> and <HI>Fathers,</HI> Ver&s;es 12th, 13th, to whom he writes &s;o particularly? And is it not evident from the whole Context that this Unc|tion from the Holy One was not an <HI>extraordinary Gift</HI> re&s;iding in any <HI>par|ticular
<PB N="7" REF="005713_0006_1026CEE3A9D6E060">
in&s;pired Per&s;on,</HI> but the Indwelling of the Spirit, which abode <HI>in the Believers in general,</HI> whereby they had an experimental Proof, that Je|&s;us was indeed the Chri&s;t, and therefore needed not that any Man &s;hould teach them (that is further teach them) for the Apo&s;tle writes unto them as <HI>knowing</HI> Per&s;ons, Ver&s;e 12th, &amp;c.&mdash;Is not this Interpretation quite con|&s;i&s;tent with the whole Scope of the Apo&s;tle in this Epi&s;tle, which was to comfort him&s;elf, and Believers in general, now &s;o many Antichri&s;ts were abroad, that (&s;ince Je&s;us Chri&s;t had declared, <HI>Matth.</HI> 24. 24. That the E|lect could not be finally deceived) they having a Proof of their Election by receiving this Unction from above, this Indwelling of the Holy Gho&s;t in their Hearts, were now enabled in a Way far &s;uperior to though not entirely exclu&s;ive of human Teaching to guard again&s;t the Seducers of the Day? And con&s;equently may not the Indwelling of the Spirit be in|&s;i&s;ted upon now as the Privilege of all real Chri&s;tians, without their being ju&s;tly &s;tiled for &s;o doing <HI>modern Enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>Again, is not his Lord&s;hip greatly mi&s;taken in his Explanation of the 16th Ver&s;e of the 8th of <HI>Romans,</HI> viz. <Q><HI>The Spirit it &s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">reth Witne&s;s with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God.</HI></Q> This Pa&s;&s;age, &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, Page 18th, <Q>As it is connected with the preceeding one, relates to the general Adoption of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> or their becoming the Sons of God, in&s;tead of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who were then rejected by God, and had lo&s;t that Title. But what was the Ground of this Preference that was g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">n to Chri&s;tians? It was plainly the <HI>Gifts of the Spirit,</HI> which <HI>they</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> and which the Jews had not. That Spirit then which by its Gifts enabled the Apo&s;tles and other Chri&s;tians to work Miracles of va|rious Kinds, was a Demon&s;tration, that God <HI>was in them of a Truth,</HI> and that their Religion was own'd by him in Oppo&s;ition to that of the Jews, whom he had de&s;erted in a judicial Manner.</Q> The Conclu&s;ion his Lord&s;hip draws from the&s;e Premi&s;es we have Pag. the 20th, viz. <Q>That the fore-mentioned <HI>Te&s;timony of the Spirit,</HI> attended with the Te&s;timo|ny of our own Spirit, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the Sincerity and good Lives of private Chri&s;tians, was the publick Te&s;timony of the miraculous Gifts of the Spirit which God had conferred on the Apo&s;tles, and many of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians; and which &s;hewed that they and their Brethren were the true Church of God, and not the <HI>Jews.</HI> And this was a plain Criterion in the fir&s;t great Controver&s;y, namely, to which of tho&s;e two Churches Men were obliged to adhere in Com|munion. And con&s;equently, this <HI>Witne&s;s of the Spirit,</HI> which &s;hews that we <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> are the <HI>Sons of God,</HI> cannot po&s;&s;ibly be appl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to the mere <HI>private</HI> Te&s;timony of the Spirit given to our own Con&s;ciences, to prove that we or private Chri&s;tians are the <HI>Sons of God</HI> and Heirs of Salvation, as is pretended by modern Enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005713_0007_1026CEADB4F4DE98">
But does not his Lord&s;hip here argue from a mi&s;taken Suppo&s;ition, viz. That the Apo&s;tle in the 8th of the <HI>Romans</HI> is &s;peaking of the miraculous Power our Lord gave his fir&s;t Apo&s;tles to work Miracles in confirmation that their Doctrine was of God? Is there any &s;uch Thing &s;o much as hin|ted at through the whole Chapter? Is not the whole Scope of it to &s;hew the Privileges of tho&s;e, who <HI>being ju&s;tified by Faith</HI> alone, Chap. 5th. <HI>Have Peace with God through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</HI> Does not the Apo&s;tle there|fore at the fir&s;t Ver&s;e &s;ay, <HI>That there is no Condemnation to them which are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us?</HI> Does he not &s;ay Ver&s;e the 9th, that the <HI>Spirit of God dwelt in them?</HI> Does not his Lord&s;hip allow, Page 16, &amp;c. That the A|po&s;tle in this and the preceeding Ver&s;es treats of that <HI>&s;piritual Principle in Chri&s;tians which enables them to mortifie the Deeds of the Body and overcome carnal Inclinations?</HI> and what Shadow of a Rea&s;on can be given to prove that the <HI>&s;ame &s;piritual Principle</HI> is not &s;poken of in Ver&s;e 16th. as bearing Witne&s;s with the Believer's Spirits that they were the Children of God? Do not the very Words imply an <HI>inward witne&s;s,</HI> even &s;omething that bears Witne&s;s with <HI>their Spirits,</HI> that they are the Children of God? Is it not &s;aid Ver&s;e 15th. to be &s;omething that they had received?&mdash;<HI>But ye have received the Spirit of Adoption whereby we cry Abba Father.</HI> And is not the obvious Sen&s;e of the&s;e Ver&s;es put together plainly this viz: <Q>That true Believers tho&s;e that are Chri&s;tians indeed, have the Spirit of God dwelling in them, Ver&s;e 9th. Are led by this Spirit,</Q> Ver. 14th, Have gotten an inward Witne&s;s from this &s;ame Spirit that they are God's Chil|dren, and therefore need not be brought into Bondage and fear, lea&s;t God would reject them, but may have free Acce&s;s, and with a full A&s;&s;urance of Faith and a holy childlike Simplicity Draw near unto him, crying, Abba Father?</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip to prove that this is not the Sen&s;e of this Pa&s;&s;age, but that the Te&s;timony of the Spirit here &s;poken of, is a <HI>publick Gift of working Miracles,</HI> refers Page 19th, to <HI>Galatians</HI> 3d and 2d, where the Apo&s;tle puts this Que&s;tion to them <Q>Received ye the Spirit?</Q> (i. e. ac|cording to his Lord&s;hip, the Power of working Miracles) <Q>by the Works of the Law, or by the Hearing of Faith, which (&s;ays his Lord&s;hip) the &s;ame Apo&s;tle pre&s;ently after explains, when he &s;ays at Ver&s;e 5th, He therefore that mini&s;tereth to you the Spirit and worketh Miracles among you, doth he it by the Works of the Law or by the Hearing of Faith</Q>? But is not here a plain Antithe&s;is between <HI>admini&s;tring the Spi|rit</HI> and <HI>working Miracles?</HI> Do they not evidently imply two di&s;tinct Things? And can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the Spirit which the Apo&s;tles a&s;ks, Ver&s;e 2d, <HI>Whether they had received by the Works of the Law, or the Hear|ing of Faith,</HI> was a Power to perform &s;uch Miracles, at lea&s;t that only? Would it not then follow, &s;ince he declares in the 8th of the <HI>Romans,</HI> that
<PB N="9" REF="005713_0008_1026CEE6487A6130">
<HI>if any Man have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t he is none of his,</HI> that either all Believers did receive his Spirit in his miraculous Gifts, or that no one is a Believer that has them not? And doth not the Apo&s;tle in this very Epi&s;tle make it appear that the Spirit here &s;poken of is not this miracu|lous <HI>outward Te&s;timony?</HI> For what &s;ays he, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4. 6. "And becau&s;e ye are Sons, God hath &s;ent forth the Spirit of his Son into your <HI>Hearts</HI> (whereby it is plain the Spirit was received into the <HI>Heart</HI>) crying, Abba Father?" And does not this quite clear up that Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Romans,</HI> Ch. 8. v. 15. about the witne&s;&s;ing Spirit and the Spirit of Adoption, viz. That Believers (be&s;ides &s;eeing the Miracles which the Apo&s;tles wrought) had an <HI>inward Te&s;timony of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> making an inward Application of the Merits of Chri&s;t to their Souls, and giving them an inward Te&s;ti|mony that they were indeed the adopted Sons of God, and therefore in a holy Confidence they might cry, Abba Father? Is there any Thing forced in this Interpretation?

<P>May I not likewi&s;e venture to affirm, that his Lord&s;hip is equally mi&s;|taken in his Interpretation of the 26th and 27th Ver&s;es of the &s;ame Chapter, which run thus, <Q>Likewi&s;e the Spirit al&s;o helpeth our Infir|mities: for we know not what we &s;hould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it&s;elf maketh Interce&s;&s;ion for us with Groanings which can|not be uttered&mdash;And he that &s;earcheth the Heart, knoweth what is the Mind of the Spirit, becau&s;e he maketh Interce&s;&s;ion for the Saints according to the Will of God.</Q></P>
<P>The Spirit here &s;poken of according to his Lord&s;hip, was the Spirit acting in the <HI>in&s;pired Per&s;on,</HI> who in the Apo&s;tolical Age, &s;ays his Lord|&s;hip, Page 24th. <Q>Had the Gift of Prayer, and interceded for the whole Congregation; &s;o that what is here &s;aid of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> is by an ea&s;y Figure transferred to the &s;piritual or in&s;pired Per&s;on, who prayed in that Capacity, for the who&s;e Chri&s;tian A&s;&s;embly&mdash;It is he that ma|keth Interce&s;&s;ion with God for private Chri&s;tians with vehement and inexpre&s;&s;ible Groanings of Sighs</Q>&mdash;But however ea&s;y it may be to find out a Figure to transfer what is here &s;aid of the Spirit, to the &s;piri|tual, or in&s;pired Per&s;on, yet how will it be ea&s;y to find a Figure to in|terpret this of the &s;piritual or in&s;pired Per&s;on at all? For has it not al|ready been &s;hewn that this whole Chapter is no where &s;peaking of any &s;uch &s;piritual in&s;pired Per&s;on, but of the Spirit of God dwelling in all Believers?</P>

His Lord&s;hip goes on, Page ibid, to comment upon the 27th Ver&s;e. <Q><HI>And be that &s;earcheth the Hearts, knoweth what is the Mind of the Spirit</HI> (i. e. of the &s;piritual or in&s;pired Per&s;on) <HI>becau&s;e he maketh Interce&s;&s;ion for the Saints according to the Will of God.</HI> That is, &s;ays his Lord&s;hip, God knows the Intentions of the &s;piritual Per&s;on, and judges of the Vehemence of his De&s;ires in Prayer for the whole A&s;&s;embly, for whom he makes Interce&s;&s;ion, with Regard to the immediate Subject of Affliction, literally indeed, <HI>according to God</HI> (<HI>kata Theon</HI>) or re|latively to him, but by Con&s;truction, conformably to the Will of God; namely that in a mo&s;t fervent Manner, the Per&s;on that has the in&s;pi|red Gift of Prayer which he u&s;es for the Benefit of the whole A&s;|&s;embly; he, I &s;ay, leaves it entirely to God, whether it be be&s;t that Chri&s;tians &s;hould &s;uffer Afflictions for the Go&s;pel, or be delivered from them.

<P>Thus far his Lord&s;hip&mdash;But where is there thro' the whole Chapter any Mention made of <HI>an A&s;&s;embly</HI> or of any <HI>&s;piritual in&s;pired Per&s;on</HI> praying in its Behalf? Does it not require a very profound Under|&s;tanding to &s;earch it out? Is it not more agreeable to the whole Scope of the Apo&s;tle in this Chapter, to believe that this Spirit here mentioned as helping Infirmities, or Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting in Pray|er, is the common Privilege of all Believers? Is he not &s;aid to make Interce&s;&s;ion for the Saints in general? And does not his Lord|&s;hip, Page 22d, in Effect own this? For what &s;ays his Lord&s;hip? <Q>Now on this Occa&s;ion, he, i. e. the Apo&s;tle adds another Proof of the Truth of Chri&s;tianity, and that Chri&s;tians are the adopted Sons of God, and more e&s;pecially with Regard to their Sufferings at that Time, for the Sake of their Religion, &s;ays he, Ver. 26th.

<P>May we not further enquire, whether his Lord&s;hip's Interpretation of the 4th and 5th Ver&s;es of the 2d Chapter of the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the Corinthians be found and con&s;i&s;tent? The Words are the&s;e, Page 27th. <Q><HI>And my Speech and my Preaching were not with the enticing Words of Man's Wi&s;dom, but in Demon&s;tration of the Spirit and of Power, that your Faith &s;hould not &s;tand in the Wi&s;dom of Men, but in the Power of God.</HI></Q> As to the former Part of the&s;e Words, viz. <Q>My Speech and my Preach|ing were not with the enticing Words of Man's Wi&s;dom,</Q> his Lord&s;hip &s;eems to agree with the Interpretation put upon them by tho&s;e whom he is plea&s;ed to term <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts;</HI> but the latter, viz. <Q><HI>The De|mon&s;tration of the Spirit and of Power,</HI></Q> His Lord&s;hip in Pages 29th, 30th, 31&s;t, &amp; 32d, would fain &s;hew means no more than that the A|po&s;tle proved Je&s;us to be the Me&s;&s;iah by Proofs out of the Prophecies of the Old Te&s;tament and evinced the Truth of Chri&s;tianity, by per|forming Miracles.</P>
<P>And &s;uppo&s;ing this may be one Sen&s;e of the Words, yet if this be the <HI>&s;ole</HI> Meaning of the Apo&s;tle's Expre&s;&s;ion, would it not have better become &s;uch a Scholar as <HI>Paul</HI> was to have &s;aid, he came to them in the Demon&s;tration of the Scriptures rather than of the Spirit? Can any parallel Pa&s;&s;age be produced where the Word Spirit, is thus put for the Scriptures? And therefore by <HI>the Demon&s;tration of the Spirit,</HI> may we not under&s;tand that the Spirit of God him&s;elf whil&s;t the Apo&s;tle was preaching wrought a demon&s;trative Conviction in the Souls of his Hear|ers; not only that what he &s;pake was of God, but al&s;o that he was a&s;|&s;i&s;ted in &s;peaking by the Spirit of God? Does not this agree with what he &s;ays, 2d Epi&s;tle, <HI>Cor.</HI> 3. 2, 3. <HI>Ye are our Epi&s;tle, written in our Hearts, known and read of all Men: Fora&s;much as ye are manife&s;tly declared to be the Epi&s;tle of Chri&s;t mini&s;tered by us, written not with Ink, but the Spirit of the living God, not in Tables of Stone, but in fle&s;hly Tables of the Heart.</HI>&mdash;And though it &s;hould be allowed that the Word <HI>Dunamis</HI> (as his Lord|&s;hip ob&s;erves, Page 30th) <Q>in its ordinary Sen&s;e in the New Te&s;ta|ment, mu&s;t &s;ignify the Power exerted in miraculous Operations;</Q> yet how is it foreign to the Apo&s;tle's Purpo&s;e to interpret it al&s;o of a divine Power or Energy which ordinarily attended the Word preached by him; I mean &s;uch a Power as accompanied the Word when the Lord opened the Heart of <HI>Lydia,</HI> and when &s;o many were pricked to the Heart and made to cry out, <HI>Men and Brethren what &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?</HI> Does not the Word <HI>Dunamis</HI> &s;eem to carry this Sen&s;e with it, 2 Cor. 7th. <HI>But we have this Trea&s;ure in earthen Ve&s;&s;els that the Excellen|cy of the Power</HI> (<HI>Dunameos</HI>)
 <HI>may be of God and not of Men</HI>&mdash;And is not <HI>Apollos</HI> &s;aid to be (<HI>Dunatos en-graphais</HI>) <HI>mighty,</HI> or powerful,

<HI>in the Scriptures,</HI> though we do not hear that he performed any Mira|cles at all? And tho' his Lord&s;hip is plea&s;ed to &s;ay Pag.ibid, <Q>For by this Power of God here &s;poken of, (i.e. a Power to work Miracles) appears expre&s;ly from the immediately following Ver&s;e, in which is a&s;&s;igned the Rea&s;on for u&s;ing this Method of proving Chri&s;tianity to be true, viz- <HI>That your Faith &s;hould not &s;tand in the Wi&s;dom of Men, but in the Power of God.</HI></Q> Yet will it not equally hold good that their Faith &s;tood not in the Wi&s;dom of Men but in the Power of God, if by the Power we under&s;tand a divine Power attending the Word preached in convincing the Con&s;cience, and changing the Hearts of Men, exclu&s;ive or be&s;ides a Power of working Miracles?</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip in the &s;ame Page proceeds thus&mdash;<Q>By <HI>the Power of God</HI> therefore mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be under&s;tood the miraculous Operations per|formed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles as a divine Te&s;timony of their Authority. He goes on in the 7th, 10th and following Ver&s;es, to explain this <HI>Demon&s;tration of the Spirit and of Power.</HI> And tells us that this Wi&s;dom of God is a My&s;tery, or Wi&s;dom formerly hidden from the World, was couched in the Types and Prophecies of the Me&s;&s;iah in the old Te&s;tament under the Title of the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the P&s;alms and all the Prophets that were actually fulfilled in Je&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash;For &s;ays he <HI>The Spirit &s;earcheth all Things even the deep Things of God. Now we have not received the Spirit of the World</HI> (viz. of O|ratory and Philo&s;ophy) <HI>but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the Things that are freely given to us of God.</HI> That is, that we might learn of the Spirit the true Meaning of tho&s;e Writings which he dictated him&s;elf, and which none but the Spirit of God could know, &s;ince the Go&s;pel is the Contrivance of God alone for Man's Salvation; and the Benefits of it are freely and of his mere Grace conferred upon us.</Q></P>
<P>But in all the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages where is there a Shadow of a Proof that by the Word <HI>Power</HI> the Apo&s;tle meant only that he worked Miracles a|mong them? Is there any &s;uch Thing &s;o much as hinted at in tho&s;e Ver&s;es? Or what greater Rea&s;on is there to infer from hence that the <HI>Demon&s;tration of the Spirit</HI> means no more than proving Chri&s;t to be the Me&s;&s;iah from the Books of the Old Te&s;tament?</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip goes on Page 31&s;t to comment upon the 13th Ver&s;e of the 1&s;t Cor. 2d. thus, The Apo&s;tle adds <Q><HI>Which Things al&s;o we &s;peak not in the Words which Man's Wi&s;dom teacheth,</HI> (viz. as before by O|ratory and Philo&s;ophy) <HI>but which the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth; comparing &s;piritual Things with &s;piritual.</HI> From which la&s;t Pa&s;&s;age it appears that the Words which the Holy Gho&s;t is &s;aid to teach mu&s;t be propheti|cal Revelations made of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the old Te&s;tament which were clearly di&s;covered to the Apo&s;tles and explained by them to

How can his Lord&s;hip in Con&s;cience make U&s;e of the Or|dination Office? Or how could you before many Witne&s;&s;es publickly confe&s;s that you were inwardly moved by the Holy Gho&s;t to take upon you the Admini&s;tration of the Church, when you openly deny him in his mo&s;t powerful, and in Believers, common Operations? Should you not tremble to think how much this looks like belying the Holy Gho&s;t, and acting the dreadful Crime of <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira</HI> over again, or lying not only unto Man, but unto God? And why are you &s;o zealous for the Church and continually crying out <HI>the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</HI> and yet trample her Offices, Collects &amp; Articles in Effect under your Feet?

And is Regeneration no more than this? What a mi&s;erable Condition then are tho&s;e in who have only their bapti&s;mal Regeneration to depend on? For who is there that has improved, nay who is there that has not &s;in|ned away this preparatory Grace? Is not this directly contrary to the whole Bapti&s;mal Office?
