<Q>AND Wi&s;dom and Knowledge &s;hall be the Stability of thy Times, and Strength of Salvation: The Fear of the Lord is his Trea&s;ure.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN our Context we have an Account of the great Di&s;tre&s;s and Danger <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Jeru|&s;alem</HI> &s;hould be brought into for their Im|piety and Inju&s;tice, <HI>Behold their valiant Ones &s;hall cry without</HI>; thro' Grief and Fear be|cau&s;e of their invading Enemies;&mdash;and <HI>the Em|ba&s;&s;adors of Peace &s;hall weep bitterly</HI>; probably, be|cau&s;e of their great Degeneracy and Back&s;lidings from the holy Truths and Ways of God.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="006985_0005_102AB0AA08939A38">The holy Prophet al&s;o &s;peaks of the great Con|&s;ternation the Sinners of <HI>Zion</HI> &s;hould be bro't into, and how the Saints and Servants of the Lord &s;hould pray to God for them, in &s;uch a Day of Di&s;tre&s;s, in that Language, v. 2. <HI>O Lord be gracious to us, we have waited for thee, be thou their Arm every Morn|ing, our Salvation al&s;o in the Time of Trouble.</HI></P>
<P>And then we have an Account of the holy Secu|rity, they &s;hould enjoy in the mid&s;t of this Trouble, v. 15th and 16th. <HI>He that walketh righteou&s;ly, and &s;peaketh uprightly, he that de&s;pi&s;eth the Gain of Op|pre&s;&s;ions, that &s;haketh his Hand from holding of Bribes, that &s;toppeth his Ears from hearing of Blood, and &s;hutteth his Eyes from &s;eeing Evil, he &s;hall dwell on high, his Place of Defence &s;hall be the Munition of Rocks.</HI></P>
<P>The Prophet further &s;peaks of the De&s;truction of their Enemies, and God's appearing on the Behalf of his People, in which he would be greatly glori|fied, v. 5th. <HI>The Lord is exalted, for he dwelleth on high; he hath filled Zion with Judgment and Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; and v. 10th. <HI>Now will I ri&s;e, &s;aith the Lord, now will I be exalted</HI>; and then &s;peaks of the happy Settlement of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> State upon this. Religion &s;hould revive, and their civil State flouri&s;h.</P>
<P>This is evidently intimated in the Words of my Text, together with the following Context.</P>
<P>Their pious King <HI>Hezekiah</HI> and his People were hereby encouraged with an A&s;&s;urance, that the ble&s;|&s;ed God &s;hould be their Saviour and Refuge, in every Day of Trouble.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="006985_0006_102AB0E3F06A4980">Here's</P>
<P N="1">1^s^t. A gracious Promi&s;e of God for them to &s;tay them&s;elves upon; <HI>Wi&s;dom and Knowledge &s;hall be the Stability of thy Times, and Strength of Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>Here's a de&s;ireable End propos'd, &s;ays an Ex|po&s;itor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Henry.</HI></NOTE> on this Place, and that is the <HI>Stability of the Times</HI>; that Things be not di&s;turb'd and un|hing'd at Home; and the <HI>Strength of Salvation</HI>; Deliverance and Succe&s;s again&s;t Enemies abroad.</P>
<P>And here's the Way and Means for obtaining this End; <HI>Wi&s;dom and Knowledge</HI>; not only <HI>Piety,</HI> but <HI>Prudence.</HI></P>
<P>And this it is which by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God will be the Stability of our Times, and the Strength of Salvation; that Wi&s;dom which is fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, and which &s;acrificeth private Intere&s;t to the public Good. Such Prudence as this will e&s;ta|bli&s;h Truth and Peace, and fortify the Bulwarks in Defence of them.</P>
<P>Here's</P>
<P N="2">2^d^l^y. A pious Maxim of State, for the King and his People to govern them&s;elves by, <HI>The Fear of the Lord is his Trea&s;ure</HI>&mdash;God's Trea&s;ure in the World, from which he receives his Tribute, or rather, it is the Prince's Trea&s;ure. A good Prince accounts it &s;o, that Wi&s;dom is better than Gold, and he &s;hall find it &s;o.</P>
<P>And then ob&s;erves, that true Religion is the be&s;t Trea&s;ure of any Prince, or People; it denominates them rich.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="006985_0007_102AB0ADA661B2E8">Be &s;ure, tho&s;e Places that have wi&s;e and good Rulers, able and faithful Mini&s;ters, &s;erious and pious People, encrea&s;ing among them, are really rich, and it contributes to that which makes a Nation rich in this World. It is therefore mo&s;t certainly the Intere&s;t of a People to encourage and &s;upport Reli|gion among them, and to take heed of every Thing that threatens to hinder it.</P>
<P>The Words I have read may be look'd upon as a remarkable gracious Prophecy, concerning the Peace and Pro&s;perity of the Church and People of God, not only under the happy Reign and Government of this excellent King, but in future &s;ucceeding Ages, with re&s;pect both to their civil and religious Inte|re&s;t: And if it might be fulfilled in the Age and Day in which we live, we &s;hall certainly &s;ee better Times than we have done in the Times and Years wherein we have &s;een &s;o much Evil, for which <HI>the Emba&s;&s;adors of Peace,</HI> and many faithful Servants of the Lord, have had cau&s;e to <HI>weep bitterly.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;peaking to the&s;e Words, I &s;hall enquire,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> What may be more particularly meant by the &s;everal Phra&s;es, or Expre&s;&s;ions, in the Text?</P>
<P>And then,</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> Shew of what Advantage it would be to the Church and People of God, to have the&s;e Words fulfilled in our Times.</P>

<P><PB N="5" REF="006985_0008_102AB0E842EAE320">I am,</P>
<P N="1">1. To &s;hew what may be more particularly meant or imply'd in the &s;everal Phra&s;es or Ex|pre&s;&s;ions in the Text.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, What by <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Knowledge</HI>?</P>
<P>It may mean <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> both hu|mane and divine; and that comes from above, from the Father of Lights, the inexhau&s;tible Foun|tain of Wi&s;dom and Under&s;tanding, <HI>in whom are hid all the Trea&s;ures of Wi&s;dom and Knowledge.</HI> That <HI>Wi&s;dom that dwells with Prudence,</HI> and that &s;hall be profitable to direct in all Matters of Importance, with re&s;pect to outward and tempo|ral, civil or eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs, in which the pub|lick Welfare is concern'd; and more e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to that Knowledge and Wi&s;dom that is divine and heavenly, which makes Men of all Orders, and in every Station, <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> for their &s;piri|tual and eternal Intere&s;ts; &s;o that they know God and <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> whom to know is Life eternal.</P>
<P>&Aacute;n infinitely wi&s;e and gracious God is pleas'd to accompany with his Ble&s;&s;ing the Means of a reli|gious and learned Education, for the qualifying and accompli&s;hing Men for the Service of God, and their Generation, in various Offices and Stati|ons, in which they may be in&s;trumental of promo|ting the publick Good, in a greater or le&s;&s;er <HI>Sphere,</HI> as God in his Providence &s;hall call, incline, and di&s;po&s;e them to it.</P>
<P>And all the&s;e Talents, Advantages and Qualifi|cations &s;hall be bro't under a &s;olemn Con&s;ecration
<PB N="6" REF="006985_0009_102AB0B100087FC8">
to the God of all their Powers, and &s;overeign Lord and Ruler of Heaven and Earth, who <HI>giveth Wi&s;|dom to the Wi&s;e, and Knowledge to them that know Under&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>I proceed to &s;hew in the next Place, What may be meant by <HI>Wi&s;dom and Knowledge being the Stability of the Times.</HI> And now; This may im|ply in it, a People's being di&s;tingui&s;hingly favour'd of God, under the Reign of a <HI>King</HI> who&s;e Throne &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;h'd on the &s;ure Foundations of Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice; and under the Admini&s;tra|tion of wi&s;e and good Rulers, in &s;ubordinate Pla|ces of Authority, both in Church and State, who &s;hall improve their Wi&s;dom and Knowledge for the Advancement of the Honour and Glory of God, and the be&s;t Good of their People, that they may &s;erve the Lord and their Generation, according to the Will of God in their &s;everal Places and Stations.</P>
<P>More particularly;</P>
<P>That <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> and <HI>Rulers</HI> are Men knowing in the Times; Men of <HI>Political Wi&s;dom</HI>; Men of Knowledge and Prudence, able to di&s;cern Time and Judgment; <HI>wi&s;e Men and Under&s;tanding, and known among their Tribes,</HI> and Men of exten&s;ive Know|ledge, and capable of judging what may be mo&s;t conducive to promote the publick Weal in all Re&s;|pects; are Men of a <HI>Genius</HI> for Government, and able to judge what Laws may be be&s;t enacted for promoting the civil and religious Intere&s;ts of their People, and for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing all Sin and Wickedne&s;s, that threatens the Ruin of a People in all their Inte|re&s;ts; are Men of Wi&s;dom to &s;earch into Matters to be con&s;idered by them, that they may judge on

which &s;ide Truth and Ju&s;tice lies, and have a Di&s;|cretion and Aptne&s;s to apply the Knowledge they have to Ends of Government, and to the Na|ture and Circum&s;tances of tho&s;e Things that are brought under their Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>And are Men of <HI>Courage</HI> and <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> not a|fraid of the Faces of Men; and are ju&s;t and upright, impartially di&s;tributing Ju&s;tice to others, and have a &s;teady con&s;tant Care and Zeal to promote Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s among Men; and are a Terror to evil doers, and a Prai&s;e to &s;uch as do well, and exemplary for every Thing that is virtuous and Prai&s;e-worthy.</P>
<P>And are indeed truly <HI>pious</HI> and <HI>godly,</HI> which in|troduceth a divine Ble&s;&s;ing on other Qualifications, and adds a Lu&s;tre and Beauty to them all; for the <HI>pure&s;t Politicks</HI> (as an able excellent Ruler and Divine of our own &s;ays) are but <HI>in&s;ipid Tra&s;h,</HI> unle&s;s they have this Sea&s;oning. It is this that influences and actuates the Principles of moral Hone&s;ty and Ju&s;tice. It is this that mu&s;t &s;trengthen the Hearts, and rou&s;e the Courage of Rulers, again&s;t the mo&s;t daring Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. It was therefore excellent Coun&s;el of <HI>Jethro</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exod. 18.21.</NOTE><HI>Thou &s;halt provide out of all the People able Men, &s;uch as fear God, and place &s;uch over them to be Rulers.</HI></P>
<P>Such was godly King <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> and a &s;ingu|lar Pattern he was of a tender Concern for Religion, and the Mini&s;ters of it, to the Honour of who&s;e Memory it is recorded, that <HI>he &s;pake comfortably
<PB N="8" REF="006985_0011_102AB0B35FB4ED98">
to all the Levites, that taught the good Knowledge of the Lord,</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">2 Chr. 30.22. and Ch. 31.4</NOTE> and took effectual Care that the Por|tion of Maintenance a&s;&s;ign'd them by the Law of God, &s;hould be rendered to them, that they might be encouraged in the Work of the Lord.</P>
<P>And tho&s;e who follow his Example, will in their Day contribute to the <HI>Stability of the Times.</HI></P>
<P>Again;</P>
<P>That the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the everla&s;ting <HI>Go&s;pel, are Men of Knowledge and Under&s;tanding; Pa&s;tors after God's own Heart</HI>; to whom God gives the Tongue of the learned, to know how to &s;peak a Word in Sea&s;on to them that are weary, are Scribes well in|&s;tructed in the Doctrines and Duties of pure and undefiled Religion, and wi&s;e to win Souls, are en|dow'd with proper Gifts and Qualifications for the Di&s;charge of the great Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, and have brought them under a &s;acred Dedication to the Service of their Lord and Ma&s;ter, and are willing to &s;pend and be &s;pent in the Service of Chri&s;t and precious Souls, e&s;pecially tho&s;e committed to their more immediate In&s;pection and Charge, tho' the more abundantly they love them, the le&s;s they &s;hould be loved.</P>
<P>They will faithfully declare the whole Coun&s;el of the Lord, whether Men will hear, or whether they will forbear; will cry aloud, and not &s;pare, but lift up their Voice like a Trumpet, to &s;hew to the People their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Jacob</HI> their Sins.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="006985_0012_102AB0ED91F9E9D8">They will plainly &s;hew to Men the Way of Salva|tion pre&s;cribed in the Go&s;pel, and in Meekne&s;s in|&s;truct tho&s;e that oppo&s;e them&s;elves, if God perad|venture will give them Repentance, to acknow|ledging of the Truth, and that they way recover them&s;elves out of the Snare of the Devil, who have been taken Captive by him at his Will. They will give no ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Offence in any Thing that the Mini&s;try may not be blamed on their Account. And if they &s;hould be reviled, they will revile not again, if they &s;hould &s;uffer, they will threaten not, but commit them&s;elves to that God that judgeth righteou&s;tly; and endure all Afflictions and Tryals as good Soldiers of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as know|ing that if they are faithful to the Death, they &s;hall receive the Crown of Life.</P>
<P>Again;</P>
<P>That the <HI>common People</HI> are well in&s;truted, and evidently under the good Impre&s;&s;ions of a religious Education, and de&s;irous of living quiet and peace|able Lives in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty; that they may obey the Laws of God, and the Laws of their Rulers, if not <HI>repugnant</HI> to the Laws of God.</P>
<P>That they are, in a Word, a reformed, righteous and godly People, &s;teadfa&s;tly adhereing to the holy Truths and Ways of God, and are adding to their Faith, Virtue, to Virtue, Knowledge, to Knowledge, Temperance, Patience, Godline&s;s, Brotherly-kind|ne&s;s and Charity. And being wi&s;e and endued with Knowledge, do &s;hew out of a good Conver&s;ation their Works with Meekne&s;s of Wi&s;dom; and do nothing thro' Strife or vain Glory, but every Thing in lowline&s;s of Mind, e&s;teeming others better than

them&s;elves, and will let their Moderation be known to all Men; and all Bitterne&s;s and Wrath, Anger, Clamour and Evil-&s;peaking &s;hall be put far away; and they will put on as becomes the Elect of God, Bowels of Mercies, Kindne&s;s, humblene&s;s of Mind, Meekne&s;s, Long-&s;uffering, Forbearance and For|givene&s;s towards others; if they have a Quarrel a|gain&s;t any, and follow after the Things that make for Love and Peace, and Things wherewith they may edify, &s;trengthen and comfort one another, that they may live in Love and Peace. And tho' they may have a Diver&s;ity of Opinion and Judgment in Matters not e&s;&s;ential and fundamental, are notwith|&s;tanding re&s;olved, by the Help of God, to maintain the Unity of the Spirit in the Bonds of Peace, and to guard again&s;t all Alienations of Heart one from another, and be ever willing to do all kind and good Offices for one another, as they have Ability and Opportunity for it.</P>
<P>And having thus &s;hewn what may be meant by Wi&s;dom and Knowledge being the Stability of the Times; I pa&s;s to con&s;ider the next Expre&s;&s;ion, of <HI>Wi&s;dom and Knowledge being the Strength of Salva|tion.</HI></P>
<P>It may imply in it, That this will lay a happy Foundation for obtaining from an infinitely wi&s;e and gracious God, all that Mercy and Salvation we may &s;tand in need of as a <HI>People.</HI></P>
<P>That the Lord will ride upon the Heavens for our Help, and in his Excellency upon the Skies; That he will &s;tir up his Strength and come and &s;ave us: that he will &s;catter all impending, dark and
<PB N="11" REF="006985_0014_102AB0F1CF57D758">
threatning Clouds, by the Light of his Countenance; that Salvation &s;hall be nigh to us, and Glory yet dwell in the Land.</P>
<P>That he will pour out his Spirit on our Rulers, Mini&s;ters and Churches, and revive his Work in the mid&s;t of the Years, and in Wrath remember Mercy.</P>
<P>That our Times &s;hall be Times of a more gene|ral, thoro' Repentance, and Reformation of all God-provoking Evils; and God will then &s;ave us from our Sins, and de&s;olating Judgments, and yet delight to build and to plant us, and not to pluck us up, and pull us down.</P>
<P>That though he may give us the Bread of Ad|ver&s;ity and the Water of Affliction, our Eyes &s;hall yet &s;ee our Teachers, that they &s;hall not be remo|ved into Corners, nor our Candle&s;ticks be removed out of their Places, and we &s;hall not be in vain wi&s;hing for the Days of the Son of Man.</P>
<P>It may imply in it, That the Name of the Lord is our &s;trong Tower, and that we &s;hall flee to it and be safe; that we may put our Tru&s;t in God, as the Hope of his <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and their Saviour and Strength in every Day of Trouble; and that we &s;hall be hid under the Shadow of his Wings until the&s;e Calamities &s;hall be over-pa&s;t, and &s;hall finally obtain <HI>Salvation</HI> with eternal Glory in the coming World.</P>
<P>I proceed to con&s;ider briefly, the other and la&s;t Expre&s;&s;ion, of <HI>the Fear of the Lord being his Trea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="006985_0015_102AB0B871A3C768">It may, in a Word, mean the Lord's giving to <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Rulers</HI> a Heart to <HI>fear</HI> him: And their chief Trea&s;ure and Delight, as an Expo&s;itor &s;ays on this Place, is, and &s;hall be in promoting the Fear and Wor&s;hip of God, which &s;hall be a great Honour aud Safe-guard to them&s;elves and People.</P>
<P>It may mean, That the Lord has wro't in their Hearts, a reverential holy Fear of Him, &s;o that they &s;et the Lord always before them, and &s;tand in awe of him, as the &s;upreme, almighty Ruler and Governor among the Nations, and as one con|tinually looking down from Heaven upon them, to &s;ee how they &s;eek and &s;erve him, and di&s;charge the various Duties incumbent on them, in their &s;everal Places and Stations; and hence are &s;ollici|tous to keep a Con&s;cience void of Offence towards God and Men, in all their Admini&s;trations, and to have the Te&s;timony of their Con&s;ciences for them, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity they have their Conver&s;ation in the World.</P>
<P>And this is an inexpre&s;&s;ible Support and Con&s;o|lation to them, in their various Offices and Stations.</P>
<P>No worldly Trea&s;ure is &s;o near and dear as this; they prefer their Intere&s;t in the Approbation and Favor of God, to all the Honors, Riches and Plea&s;ures of this World.</P>
<P>They e&s;teem it much better to get Wi&s;dom than Gold, and to get Under&s;tanding, rather to be cho&s;en than Silver. They love the Commandments of God above Gold; and make the Word of God the Man of their Coun&s;el, a Light to their Feet,
<PB N="13" REF="006985_0016_102AB0F355B35FC8">
and a Lamp to their Paths. And all their Tem|pers and Behaviors in every Station and Condition of Life, are under the Government of this holy Principle, ruling in their Hearts.</P>
<P>And now I proceed to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> general Head of my Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">II. To &s;hew of what Advantage it would be to the Church and People of God, to &s;ee the Ac|compli&s;hment of this Prophecy in our Times?</P>
<P>It's certain nothing could conduce more to keep off wa&s;ting Judgments, and to promote the public Weal and Tranquility of a People, both in their civil and religious Intere&s;ts, than to be endow'd with this Wi&s;dom, Knowledge, and the Fear of God. This would bring on that Stability of the Times, and Strength of Salvation, we &s;o much need at this Days.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall only &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. It would be a happy Means of averting threat|ned Judgments.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="2">2. Of procuring all needed Mercies and Ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It would be a happy Means of averting threat|ned Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>It is the want of this Wi&s;dom, Knowledge, and Fear of the Lord that provokes a holy and righteous God to &s;end down his Judgments on us. So it was with his profe&s;&s;ing People of old, who

were called on <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ho&s;ea, Ch. 4th.</NOTE> to hear the Word of the Lord, who had a Controver&s;y with the Inhabitants of the Land, becau&s;e there was no Truth, nor Mercy, nor <HI>Knowledge</HI> of God; but Swearing, and Lying, and Stealing, and committing Adultery, and other &s;candalous Iniquities abounding in the mid&s;t of them; and therefore the Prophet &s;ays, The Land &s;hall mourn, and every One that dwelleth therein &s;hall langui&s;h; and De&s;truction be bro't upon them for lack of <HI>Knowledge.</HI> Becau&s;e they had rejected <HI>Knowledge,</HI> God wou'd al&s;o reject them. They had forgotten the Law of their God, and he wou'd al&s;o forget their Children: And becau&s;e they &s;in|ned again&s;t him, as they were increa&s;ed, therefore he wou'd change their Glory into Shame; puni&s;h them for their Ways, and reward them their Do|ings.</P>
<P>The Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;ays concerning this Peo|ple, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chap. 59th.</NOTE> None calleth for Ju&s;tice, nor any pleadeth for Truth, they conceive Mi&s;chief, and bring forth Iniquity, and there is no Judgment in their Go|ings, they had made them crooked Paths, and by going therein &s;hould not know Peace; and there|fore Judgment would be far from them, neither &s;hould Ju&s;tice overtake them; they waited for Light, but behold Ob&s;curity, for Brightne&s;s, but they walked in Darkne&s;s: Though they looked for Judgment there was none, and for Salvation, but it was far from them.</P>
<P>And what now was the Cau&s;e of all this?&mdash;Their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions were multiply'd, and their
<PB N="15" REF="006985_0018_102AB0F64ED180B8">
Iniquities te&s;tify'd again&s;t them, in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing and lying again&s;t the Lord, and departing away from their God, &s;peaking Oppre&s;&s;ion and Revolt, conceiving and uttering from the Heart, Words of Fal&s;hood; and Judgment was turned away back|ward, and Ju&s;tice &s;tood afar off; Truth was fal|len in the Street, and Equity could not enter; and the Lord &s;aw it, and it di&s;plea&s;ed him that there was no Judgment, and &s;o the Wrath of God came down upon them. God has expre&s;ly declar'd in his Word, that if his People will not be reformed, but walk contrary to him, he will walk contrary unto them, and puni&s;h them yet &s;even Times more for their Sins.</P>
<P>But what Encouragement have we to fear the Lord, and obey his Voice; and that upon our Re|pentance, and returning to the Lord, he will have Mercy on us, and not bring threatned di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Calamities upon us; that we &s;hall be deliver'd from Earthquakes and Wars, Famine and Pe&s;tilence, and every other de&s;olating Judgment, and the Lord would repent him of what further Evil he had thought to do unto us.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> It wou'd be a happy Means of procuring all needed Mercies and Ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>God has in his Word abundantly encourag'd the Be&s;towment of &s;uch Ble&s;&s;ings, if we become a righteous and godly People.</P>
<P>We might then hope for God's gracious Pre|&s;ence with his People; that his Eye would be on them for good continually; that he would appoint
<PB N="16" REF="006985_0019_102AB0BE6C1FD660">
Salvation for Walls and Bulwarks, as he did about <HI>Zion</HI>; and command Deliverance and Salvation for them in Times of Fear and Danger, and bla&s;t the Attempts of their invading Enemies, by marvellous Interpo&s;itions of Providence, as in Times pa&s;t.</P>
<P>And when their Ways plea&s;e the Lord, will cau&s;e their Enemies to be at Peace with them, and their Peace &s;hould be as a River, and their Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, as the Waves of the Sea.</P>

<P>We &s;hould have our Judges re&s;tored, as at the fir&s;t, and our Coun&s;ellors as at the Beginning.

<Q><P>A good and upright Judge is the Life and Soul of the Law, and the living Oracle of a Common-Wealth.</P>
<P>It is the proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch a One to be the Mini&s;ter of Ju&s;tice, his fir&s;t and greate&s;t Ac|compli&s;hment to know and di&s;cern what is true and right. The Laws of his Country are his only Guide and Direction, to which he will &s;trictly conform him&s;elf in all his Opinions, Proceedings and Sentences. From the&s;e he will never vary in the lea&s;t Point what&s;oever; but will give Judgment always as they direct, ac|cording to the well-known Principles of Ju&s;tice and Equity. Anger and Pa&s;&s;ion, Hope, Love and Affection, Hatred and Malice, and every the lea&s;t Shadow and Su&s;picion of the&s;e, will be bani&s;h'd far off, from every Tribunal and Court of Judicature where he pre&s;ides, together with
<PB N="30" REF="006985_0033_102AB13E9172DF88">
Bribery and Corruption, Fear and Terror, Adu|lation and Flattery, and what&s;oever may ob&s;truct or pervert the regular Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t certain it is, That no Order of Subjects what&s;oever, has contributed more to the promo|ting of Sedition, Strife and Oppre&s;&s;ion, than a Sett of Judges, who have been of a mercenary, corrupt and adulterous Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>On the other hand, By a due and regular Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice a Nation is pre&s;erv'd in Peace and Unity. Love &amp; Good-will are every where promoted; Complaints and Grievances, Hatred and Animo&s;ities cea&s;e; and a People is rai&s;ed to that Pitch of Happine&s;s, as to fear no Evil, and to want nothing which is good for them.</P></Q>
<P>Such u&s;eful, generous Sentiments as the&s;e, are diffu&s;ed thro' that excellent Work of the noble Au|thor he refers to; and he adds, <Q>They cannot be too univer&s;ally known, too frequently inculcated, or too deeply-radicated in the Brea&s;ts of all tho&s;e, who are Lovers of the publick Inte|re&s;t, and heartily &s;ollicitous for it's Pre&s;ervation and Advancement.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to addre&s;s my &s;elf,</P>

the Times better; and if God will ble&s;s our faithful Labours, Wi&s;dom and Knowledge &s;hall be the Sta|bility of our Times, and Strength of Salvation, and the Fear of the Lord our Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Be we then exhorted to do our utmo&s;t, that this evangelical Prophecy in my Text may be ful|fill'd in our Day.</P>
<P>The great End and principal De&s;ign of our Mini&s;try, is to teach Men <HI>Wi&s;dom, Knowledge</HI> and <HI>the Fear of God.</HI></P>
<P>The Prie&s;t's Lips &s;hould keep Knowledge, and the People &s;hould &s;eek the Law at our Mouths, for we are the Me&s;&s;engers of the Lord of Ho&s;ts. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mal. 2. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And if we are de&s;titute of the mini&s;terial Gifts and Graces of the Spirit of God, how poorly qua|lify'd &s;hall we be for this &s;acred Office, by which we are bro't &s;o near to God!</P>
<P>Let us mourn for all the Provocations, We, or any of our Order of Men, have given to God, to deny his Ble&s;&s;ing on the Mini&s;try and Admini&s;tra|tions of our Rulers, or our <HI>own</HI>; and by Faith re|pair to the great Sacrifice of Atonement for Mer|cy and Forgivene&s;s; and humbly beg of God to give us that divine and heavenly Wi&s;dom and Knowledge we &s;o much need, to qualify us for the faithful Di&s;charge of our Mini&s;try; and that he would make us wi&s;e to win Souls; and that we may no longer have &s;o much cau&s;e to weep bit|terly
<PB N="32" REF="006985_0035_102AB141F0060D58">
becau&s;e of an un&s;ucce&s;sful Mini&s;try; that we labour in vain, and &s;pend our Strength for nought and in vain. But if we are faithful, our Judgment is with the Lord, and our Work with our God, and we &s;hall be glorious in the Eyes of the Lord tho' I&s;rael be not gathered, and many &s;hou'd go on, to receive the Grace of God in vain, and even die without Wi&s;dom, and Salvation be forever far from them.</P>
<P>But let us beg of God, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> that we may not be &s;ent to make any blind Eyes blinder, and hard Hearts harder, that Men &s;hould not con|vert and be healed; but that the Hand of the Lord may be with us, and a great Number believe, and turn to the Lord, and become his willing and obe|dient People in the Day of his Power; that he would therefore give to his People every where hearing Ears and under&s;tanding Hearts, that they may know and increa&s;e in Wi&s;dom, Knowledge and the Fear of God; and &s;o the Seals of our Mini&s;try be mul|tiply'd, who &s;hall be our Joy and Crown of Re|joicing in the Day of the Lord, if we may find Mer|cy of the Lord in that Day; and after we have preached to others, not be <HI>our&s;elves Ca&s;t-aways.</HI></P>
<P>May the repeated In&s;tances of the Death of our Brethren in the Mini&s;try, awaken our mo&s;t &s;ollicitous Endeavours to get ready for that awful Day; and the Death of that faithful Servant of the Lord, in a particular Manner, whom we lately followed to his Grave <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Reverend Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>; and who was the la&s;t <HI>Me&s;&s;enger of the Lord of Ho&s;ts,</HI> to our <HI>Civil Rulers</HI> on a like Occa|&s;ion,

<P>Help Lord, for the godly Man cea&s;eth, for the Faithful fail from among the Children of Men!</P>
<P>I &s;hall now clo&s;e with a Word of <HI>Exhortation,</HI></P>

<P>Be you now exhorted to &s;eek for Wi&s;dom, Know|ledge and the Fear of God, without which we &s;hall never &s;ee that Stability of the Times, we are &s;o of|ten wi&s;hing and praying for.</P>
<P>If our <HI>civil Rulers</HI> are endow'd with <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Knowledge, political</HI> and <HI>divine,</HI> and are every Way qualified for their exalted Stations, yet if the Gene|rality of the People are ignorant and de&s;titute of the Fear of God, are carele&s;s and &s;lothful in Religion,

and will not for&s;ake their evil Ways, and return to the Lord, and the crying Sins they have been &s;o often warned of, and humbled for, are &s;till abound|ing in the mid&s;t of them, this will be a &s;ufficient Provocation to a holy God, to withold his Ble&s;&s;ing from their wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t concerted Mea&s;ures to pro|mote the Pro&s;perity and Happine&s;s of their People.</P>
<Q><P>Whatever, &s;ays one, the Advantages are which Rulers have to promote the People's Good, and whatever Pains they take to improve them, yet Rulers them&s;elves are but &s;econd Cau&s;es, and will fail in their Endeavours, and of their Aims, as God &s;hall withold his Ble&s;&s;ing; and that God oftentimes does, as a ju&s;t Puni&s;hment of the People's Sins.</P>
<P>When any Detriment befalls the State, it is common for the Mini&s;ters of it to bear the Blame, when as they many Times lea&s;t de&s;erve it: For if there be an ungrateful, murmuring, proud Spirit, a mutinous, envious and rebellious Spirit an ir|religious Spirit prevailing among a People, it is not all the Coun&s;els of the wi&s;e&s;t, nor Under&s;tand|ing of the prudent, nor the Conduct of the mo&s;t &s;ufficient Men, that can keep off Ruin from them. Such a People may be mi&s;erable, do their Rulers what they can.</P>
<P>It was not King <HI>Jo&s;iah's</HI>'s Piety or Prudence (however at pre&s;ent it laid &s;ome kind of Re&s;traint upon them) that could divert the approaching lamentable Fate of that &s;tubborn, &s;inful People he had the Rule of.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="35" REF="006985_0038_102AB11461F0FAE8"><Q>There is much of the Succe&s;s of Government depending upon the &s;uitable becoming Behaviour of the People under it.</Q> If they continue im|penitent and unreformed, they may look for that awful Judgment, <HI>not to have &s;trong Rods for Scepters to rule them.</HI> Their Sins de&s;erve it; and the Lord has threatned thus to puni&s;h the Iniquity of his People. <Q>When <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had degenerated, and their Religion was become Formality, and their Devotion, Hypocri&s;y, the Lord faith, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 29.14. <HI>The Wi&s;dom of their wi&s;e Men &s;hall peri&s;h, and the Under&s;tanding of their prudent Men &s;hall be hid.</HI> Thus <HI>Samuel</HI> threatens the People, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 12.25.</NOTE><HI>But if ye &s;hall &s;till do wickedly, ye &s;hall be con&s;u|med, both ye and your King.</HI> When the Lord for&s;akes tho&s;e that have the Rule of his People, no wonder if we here cau&s;e to complain as in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 3.12. <HI>They which lead thee, cau&s;e thee to err.</HI> But the Ri&s;e of this Mi&s;chief is often in the Wickedne&s;s of the People.

<P>When a People highly favour'd of God with a precious Day of Go&s;pel-Grace and Advantages for getting of Wi&s;dom, will not hear Coun&s;el and re|ceive In&s;truction, but de&s;pi&s;e Reproof; and will not obey the Voice of their Teachers, yea, hate Know|ledge, and will not choo&s;e the Fear of the Lord; it may be look'd on as a Time of awful Deadne&s;s

and Degeneracy indeed. And if it be &s;o with us at this Day, yet we are now to hear the Voice and Call of Chri&s;t the <HI>Incarnate Wi&s;dom of God,</HI> in &s;uch pungent, affectionate Language as that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov 8th Ch. beg.</NOTE>; Doth not Wi&s;dom cry, and Under&s;tanding put forth her Voice; &s;he uttereth her Voice in the Streets; &s;he crieth in the chief Place of Concour&s;e; in the City &s;he uttereth her Words, &s;aying, unto you, O Men, I call, and my Voice is to the Sons of Men; O ye &s;imple under&s;tand Wi&s;dom; and ye Fools be of an under&s;tanding Heart.

<P>And what Encouragement have we to &s;eek for Wi&s;dom, Knowledge and the Fear of God: <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Prov.

He layeth up found Wi&s;dom for the Righteous; He is a Buckler to them that walk uprightly. He keepeth the Paths of Judgment, and pre&s;erveth the Way of his Saints. Then &s;halt thou under&s;tand Righteou&s;|ne&s;s and Judgment and Equity, yea every good

Path. When Wi&s;dom entereth into thine Heart, and Knowledge is plea&s;ant unto thy Soul, Di&s;cretion &s;hall pre&s;erve thee, Under&s;tanding &s;hall keep thee. And in the <HI>third</HI> Chapter, from the 13<HI>th</HI> Ver&s;e, Happy is the Man that &s;indeth Wi&s;dom, and the Man that getteth Under&s;tanding; for the Merchan|dize of it is better than the Merchandize of Silver, and the Gain thereof than fine Gold. She is more precious than Rubies, and all the Things thou can't de&s;ire are not be compared to her. Length of Days is in her right Hand, and in her left Riches and Honour. Her Ways are Ways of Plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her Paths are Peace. She is a Tree of Life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that retaineth her. Exalt her, and &s;he &s;hall promote thee: She &s;hall bring thee to Honour when thou do&s;t embrace her. She &s;hall give to thine Head an Ornament of Grace, a Crown of Glory &s;hall &s;he deliver to thee.</P>
<P>What greater Encouragement can we de&s;ire, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> to &s;eek and plead for divine and hea|venly Wi&s;dom and the Fear of God? But yet how many, tho' they have now a Price in their Hands for getting this Wi&s;dom, have no Heart to it? And are practically &s;aying to almighty God, depart from us, for we de&s;ire not the Knowledge of thy Ways.</P>
<P>And the Fear of the Lord, is &s;o far from being their Trea&s;ure, that this World with it's Honours, Riches and Plea&s;ures, is dearer to them, and more e&s;teem'd and valued, than the Favour of God, or the Riches of an heavenly Inheritance.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="006985_0041_102AB14B65914F40">Their Time and Tho'ts are &s;wallow'd up in worldly Pur&s;uit; in adding to their worldly Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions and Trea&s;ures; and they &s;pend their Mo|ney for that which is not Bread, and their Labour for that which &s;atisfys not. The Cares of the World and Deceitfulne&s;s of Riches choke the Seed &s;own in their Hearts, and &s;o it becomes unfruitful: The Spirit of this World eats out the Vitals of Re|ligion. And tho' they may keep up a Form of Godline&s;s, they are utter Strangers to the Power of it, governing their Hearts and Lives.</P>
<P>Have we not Rea&s;on to fear, that the Number of &s;uch has been awfully increa&s;ed, and great Pro|vocation thereby given to God, to &s;catter Darkne&s;s in the Paths of our Rulers, and to bring us into perplexing Straits and Difficulties on many Ac|counts, out of which we are not extricated to this Day?</P>
<P>The lamentable Degeneracies and Back&s;lidings of this People, have been the procuring Cau&s;e of all the Tokens of the divine Anger.</P>
<P>And if they &s;hall per&s;i&s;t in them, it will look awfully with re&s;pect to the Infliction, not only of more temporal Judgments, but of &s;piritual Plagues and Judgments too, which are more to be depreca|ted than any other; and we &s;hall have rea&s;on to fear that the Lord has ca&s;t many away from his Pre|&s;ence, and taken his holy Spirit from them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> let them alone in Sin, and given them up to their own Hearts Lu&s;ts, and to walk after their own Coun&s;el, and will &s;uffer them to live only to fill up the Mea&s;ure of their Iniquities, and to trea&s;ure

up Wrath again&s;t the Day of Wrath, and Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God.</P>
<P>But may God of his infinite Mercy be better to us than our Fears; and by gracious Influen|ces of his Spirit, revive his Work in the mid&s;t of the Years, and in Wrath remember Mercy for the whole Body of this People, in giving Wi&s;dom, Knowledge and the Fear of God to them; that our Fle&s;h may no longer tremble for fear of God, and have &s;o much rea&s;on to be afraid of the&s;e Judg|ments being inflicted on us.</P>
<P>And we &s;hall have rea&s;on to hope they are not as yet; if this People &s;hall be generally &s;tirring up them&s;elves to engage in the Fear and Service of God, to get Wi&s;dom, and with all their gettings to get Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>And O that all the People of the Land were wi&s;e and under&s;tood this, and would con&s;ider their latter End! This is the affectionate Wi&s;h of the great God concerning this People; and &s;o is that, O that there were &s;uch an Heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my Commandments always, that it might be well with them, and their Children forever!</P>

<P>Let all who have an Intere&s;t at the Throne of Grace, unite in our humble and &s;ervent Supplica|tions to that God by whom Kings reign, for our KING in &s;upreme, and all in &s;ubordinate Places of Power and Tru&s;t:</P>

<P>That our PRIVILEDGES, <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>&s;acred,</HI> may be continued; that we may never come to know the Worth of them by the Want of them.</P>
