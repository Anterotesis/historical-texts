<P>I Wi&s;h, that another Sen&s;e may now have the like Operation; That the <HI>Ear</HI> may al&s;o <HI>affect the Heart</HI>; That when the <HI>Heart-affecting</HI> Objects your <HI>Eyes</HI> may find in the World about you, do &s;trike upon your <HI>Ears</HI> in our Enumeration of them, the <HI>Hearers</HI> may be <HI>Heartily affected</HI> with it. <HI>My Hearers,</HI> You mu&s;t &s;hut your <HI>Eyes,</HI> and &s;top your <HI>Ears,</HI> &amp; &s;tupi&s;y all your <HI>Affections,</HI> if you take not an <HI>Affectionate Notice</HI> of the Things, which
<PB N="4" REF="001507_0003_0fb3802092548528">
I am going to &s;et before you. Among the re&s;t, I intend a very <HI>Particular Notice</HI> of &s;ome Ob&s;ervable Things which &s;eem to be Evident <HI>Judgments</HI> quickly overtaking &s;uch as have been given up to more than ordi|nary Wickedne&s;s, both here, and in &s;ome other Places.</P>
<P>It was an Ancient Ob&s;ervation; Eccl. VIII. 11. <HI>Becau&s;e Sentence again&s;t an Evil Work is not Executed &s;peedily, therefore the Heart of the Sons of Men, is fully &s;et in them to do Evil.</HI> But &s;ince we have &s;een more than once the Wrath of God <HI>Executed Speedily,</HI> and &s;o Dreadfully upon &s;ome <HI>Evil Workers,</HI> it may be Hoped, the <HI>Hearts</HI> of men will be <HI>Affected</HI> with it, and the <HI>Hearts</HI> of &s;ome, not &s;o <HI>fully &s;et in them to do Evil,</HI> as they u&s;e to be.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prophet</HI> and <HI>Poet,</HI> who made the <HI>Lamentations,</HI> that afford our Text unto us, had at this time a mo&s;t <HI>Heart-affecting &s;ight</HI> before his Eyes. The whole BOOK of <HI>Lamentations</HI> is written, to tell you what it was. And the Clau&s;e that next follows the Text, more particularly does tell you,
<PB N="5" REF="001507_0003_0fb3802092548528">
It was, <HI>Becau&s;e of all the Daughters of my City.</HI> The <HI>Chaldeans</HI> had made fearful Ravages upon the <HI>Country Towns,</HI> which were the <HI>Daughters</HI> of the Capital City. <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was the <HI>Mother of them all. Jeru&s;alem</HI> was al&s;o expecting the &s;ame Lamentable Fate, with her <HI>Daughters.</HI> Yea, She had already Drunk very deep of the Cup; &s;he had al|ready been once Taken, and Plundred, &amp; Spoiled, &amp; mi&s;erably Circum&s;tanced. Now, &s;ays he, <HI>Mine Eye affecteth mine Heart</HI>! O Servant of God, what was in thine <HI>Eye</HI>? He had in his <HI>Eye,</HI> whole Towns laid in A&s;hes, by a Barbarous Enemy, a <HI>Bitter &amp; Ha&s;ty Nation</HI>; tho' far le&s;s Barbarous &amp; Bloody than One at this Day running a|muck among the Nations! He had in his <HI>Eye,</HI> multitudes of his Brethren, led away <HI>Captives</HI> by Cruel <HI>Babylonians</HI>; Multitudes Ma&s;&s;acred and Murdered, and made a Sa|crifice to the Fury of a Terrible <HI>Tyrant.</HI> He had in his <HI>Eye,</HI> the Effects of raging <HI>Famine</HI> &amp; <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI>; All Order overturned; Univer&s;al Confu&s;ion raging every where; the Symptoms of a Total De&s;olation ap|proaching. It mu&s;t be an <HI>Heart of Ada|mant,</HI> that would not be <HI>affected</HI> with the
<PB N="6" REF="001507_0004_0fb380221b5f2fd8">
Report, which an <HI>Eye</HI> beholding &s;uch <HI>Spectacles</HI> mu&s;t give unto it.</P>
<P>But the DOCTRINE which I am now to give you is this.</P>
<P><HI>When we have Heart-affecting Spectacles before our Eyes, we &s;hould be Heartily affected with them.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Eye</HI> &s;hould <HI>affect</HI> the <HI>Heart,</HI> when we &s;ee with our <HI>Eye,</HI> what &s;hould not be &s;een without an <HI>affected Heart.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t. <HI>Wonder not</HI> at it, That the World is filled with <HI>Heart affecting Spectacles</HI>; yea, with <HI>Mi&s;erable Spectacles.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Heart affecting Specta|cles,</HI> is the <HI>Wor&s;t</HI> of them all; that is, The SIN, the SIN of the world: this tis that has brought in the re&s;t. The Sum of the <HI>Heart-affecting Spectacles</HI> in the world, is that; Lam. V. 16. <HI>We unto us, that we have Sinned.</HI> Fir&s;t, we &s;ee <HI>Sin</HI> breaking in upon the World; a <HI>Flood</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> by our Fall from God&punc; breaking in, and carrying all before it. O Spectacle full of Horror! O Hard <HI>Heart,</HI> O Ba&s;e <HI>Heart,</HI> that is not Affected with it! The Death which we &s;ee to be the
<PB N="7" REF="001507_0004_0fb380221b5f2fd8">
<HI>Wages of Sin</HI>; the Evil which we &s;ee <HI>Pur|&s;uing of Sinners</HI>; the Wrath of God which we &s;ee Overtaking and Overwhelming the <HI>Children of Di&s;obedience</HI>; This 'tis, that makes every Corner of the world, full of Heart-affecting Spectacles. I am &s;ure, the <HI>Redeemer</HI> of the World &s;o accounted of them.</P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>How</HI> &s;hould our <HI>Hearts</HI> be <HI>af|fected</HI> with &s;uch <HI>Heart-affecting Spectacles</HI>?</P>
<P>Not with <HI>Wonder,</HI> or <HI>Murmur,</HI> I have told you. But I an&s;wer; <HI>Variou&s;ly.</HI> Ac|cording to the <HI>Various Nature</HI> of the Specta|cles.</P>
<P>When our <HI>Eye</HI> &s;hows us a Mi&s;erable Spectacle, it mu&s;t affect our <HI>Heart</HI> with <HI>Commi&s;eration.</HI> We &s;hould heartily Com|mi&s;erate the Mi&s;erable; our Heart &s;hould be touched with a <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> for them. So we read, Job XXX. 25. <HI>Did not I weep for him that was in Trouble? Was not my Soul grieved for the Poor</HI>?</P>
<P>If there be Sin joyned with Mi&s;ery in the Spectacle, there mu&s;t be <HI>Anger,</HI> there mu&s;t be <HI>Angui&s;h,</HI> joyned with the <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion.</HI> We mu&s;t be <HI>angry &amp; not &s;in</HI>; we mu&s;t there|fore be <HI>angry at &s;in.</HI> Our <HI>Heart</HI> mu&s;t be
<PB N="8" REF="001507_0005_0fb3802391199fe0">
Affected with a ju&s;t Indignation at every Sin. So we read, 2 Pet. II. 7, 8. <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> Lot <HI>was Vexed with the filthy Conver&s;ation of the Wicked; That Righteous man dwelling a|mong them, in Seeing and Hearing, Vexed his Righteous Soul from day to day, with their unlawful Deeds.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is this all the <HI>affection</HI> that is now called for. When we &s;ee Sin committed, we &s;hould be moved with Fear. Sin does Expo&s;e men to the Judgments of God. When we &s;ee Sin, we &s;hould Fear, le&s;t the Judgments of God befal the Sinner; yea, and tho&s;e that are about him al&s;o. Thus we read; P&s;al. CXIX. 118, 120. <HI>Thou ha&s;t trodden down all them that Err from thy Statutes; My Fle&s;h trembles for fear of thee, &amp; I am afraid of thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">udgments.</HI></P>
<P>But then, methinks we may &s;ee occa&s;ions for Thankfulne&s;s, even in every Mi&s;erable Spectacle. We &s;hould have our Hearts Affected with a Thankful Admiration at the Di&s;tingui&s;hing Favours of God unto our &s;elves. <Q>Lord, Why am not I &s;uch a Spectacle? Why is not this my Un|happine&s;s? Tis what I have de&s;erved, as much as any in the world.</Q> In the
<PB N="9" REF="001507_0005_0fb3802391199fe0">
mid&s;t of <HI>Lamentations,</HI> we have tho&s;e Ac|knowledgments; Lam. III. 22. <HI>It is of the Lords Mercies that we are not Con&s;umed: becau&s;e His Compa&s;&s;ions fail not.</HI></P>
<P>The proper <HI>affections</HI> on &s;uch <HI>Spectacles</HI> are not yet all fully <HI>to the Life</HI> Expre&s;&s;ed. Something mu&s;t be produced <HI>in the Life.</HI> Our Affections mu&s;t produce Affectionate Re&s;olutions to Do all the <HI>Good</HI> that we can. We are affectionately to Devi&s;e Good, for the Relief of the Heart-affecting Specta|cles. Or, the Spectacles are to mind us of &s;ome <HI>Good</HI> that we mu&s;t Re&s;olve to do for our Selves, or Others. We mu&s;t be provoked unto &s;ome Holy and U&s;eful Re|&s;olutions. We mu&s;t fetch &s;ome Good out of Evil Spectacles, Think, <Q>Wherein mu&s;t I be the better, by what I &s;ee?</Q> Think, <Q>What &s;hall I do, that Others may be the Better for what I &s;ee?</Q></P>
<P>To Illu&s;trate this matter, there can be nothing &s;o Suitably, nothing &s;o Cogently, &s;et before you, as the Example of the ad|mirable JESUS. To introduce on all Occa&s;ions, the mention of His <HI>Glories,</HI> you know, tis the Spirit, the Study, the <HI>Salt</HI> of our Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Our Amiable and Admirable JESUS,
<PB N="10" REF="001507_0006_0fb3802532fc1020">
had often before Him, Heart-affecting Spectacles. How did He Entertain them? We read, <HI>He was Grieved.</HI> We read, <HI>He Sigh'd.</HI> We read, <HI>He Wept.</HI> We read, <HI>He was moved with Compa&s;&s;ion.</HI> His Holy Soul was full of Agony. Oh, How He laid to Heart, the Evil which He &s;aw that the Fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> had brought upon the World! His Heart broke, and bled upon it! When He &s;aw any Good, He Cried out, <HI>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven &amp; Earth</HI>! And for the Good He did! He went a|bout, &s;till doing of Good. Yea, the Sun in the Firmament, it never did the Good, that was done by this Brighter Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>&para; I am now ready to &s;et before your <HI>Eyes,</HI> O Congregation of the Lord, a Number of <HI>Heart-affecting Spectacles.</HI> They are <HI>Made</HI> already. They need only to be <HI>Shown.</HI> It may be, &s;ome of you have ne|ver taken due Notice of them. I am going therewithal to &s;how you, How your Hearts are to be Affected with them.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Look Inward.</HI> The Fir&s;t Coun&s;el, to

Man, Ca&s;t an <HI>Eye</HI> upon thy own Soul! Say, was there ever &s;uch a woful, &s;uch a rueful Spectacle? What a Spectacle is the <HI>Leper</HI>? Or, the Creature de&s;cribed, I&s;a.

A Soul Wounded in all its Faculties. Blind, unable to &s;ee Truth; Lame, Unable to do Right. A Soul, full of Enmity to GOD, and all Goodne&s;s. A Soul, Depraved with mo&s;t Vicious Inclinations. A Soul, En&s;laved unto Sa|tan, and the Powers of Darkne&s;s.

Their <HI>Enemies fill the Countrey's.</HI> The World hates them; They are mo&s;t Unrea&s;onably Per&s;ecuted by the World.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="001507_0009_0fb38187108ab9d8">In our Nation, what Abominable Things are done continually!

<P>There is a Faithful, and Worthy Man, Dr. <HI>John Edwards</HI>; who has lately obli|ged the Publick, with a Printed Sermon, on the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of the Sins of <HI>Eng|land.</HI> That Servant of God, with a Cou|rage well becoming &s;uch an one, hath E|numerated horrendous In&s;tances, wherein the Land hath grievou&s;ly Sinned.

E</HI> accompanyed with Rain, Hail &amp; Snow, and a very dark Air, we run upon the Ea&s;t end of a Rock called <HI>Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n I&s;land</HI>; about 4 Leagues to the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Pi&s;cataqua</HI>: after two vehement Thumps upon the Rock, a third Sea hove the Ship along the &s;ide of it; the Sea running very high, and violently beating upon us, laboured the Ship &s;o exce&s;&s;ively, that we looked every Mo|ment when &s;he would fall to pieces; and the Wea|ther &s;o dark, that tho' we were not above 20 or 30 yards off, yet we could &s;ee nothing of the <HI>Rock:</HI> &s;o that there appeared to us but a very &s;mall po&s;&s;ibi|li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of e&s;caping with our lives; and we were
<PB N="51" REF="001507_0026_0fb382710f94ff98">
ju&s;tly thrown into a con&s;ternation at the &s;ad pro&s;|pect of immediately peri&s;hing in the Waters.</P>
<P>After we had &s;pent &s;ome time in earne&s;tly com|mitting our &s;elves to the Divine Mercy and Pro|tection, we cut our Main and Fore-ma&s;t by the board, which Providentially falling to the Rock, I de&s;ired &s;ome of the Men to try, if by the help of the Ma&s;ts they could recover the Shoar; and let us know their &s;afety by their Calls to us: Two or Three of them did &s;o; but the fiercene&s;s of the <HI>Wind,</HI> and the roaring of the <HI>Sea,</HI> perfectly drown'd their Voices, that we concluded 'em lo&s;t: How|ever the Ship bilging, the Decks and Beams open|ing, and all things &s;wimming out of the hould, ob|liged us to make the &s;ame attempt they had done before us, which thro' the wonderful goodne&s;s of God, we did with &s;ucce&s;s; tho' much torn and brui&s;ed by the violence of the Sea again&s;t the Rock. When we had joyfully met tho&s;e that left us, we &s;ought for &s;helter to the Leeward of the I&s;land, but found it &s;o &s;mall, incon&s;iderable and &s;craggy a Rock that it would afford us <HI>none</HI>; nor indeed room enough to walk, to &s;ecure us from the Injuries of the Wet and Cold.</P>
<P>When the Day appeared, it pre&s;ented us with a di&s;mal Spectacle, a doleful little Spot in the Sea, of about an Hundred yards &s;quare, with only &s;ome ruins of our la&s;t Nights Shipwrack ca&s;t up, or da&s;h|ing again&s;t it; and a Mi&s;erable number of us with|out Food or Shelter; &s;aving &s;ome &s;mall pieces of <HI>Chee&s;e,</HI> we pick'd from among the Sea-weed, and &s;ome old Canvas we &s;pread on the Craggs of the Rock to &s;tow under at Night: part of our yards came a &s;hoar, with our Cables and &s;ome Junk
<PB N="52" REF="001507_0027_0fb3827292dc9918">
conger'd about them, and our Anchor &s;o Weighed by 'em, that a &s;end of the Sea would &s;hew it above Water; and &s;ome part of the Stern, with &s;everal pieces of Plank and Timber.</P>
<P>The next Morning, (13<HI>th</HI>) One <HI>Martin Downs</HI> our Cook dyed; and the be&s;t burial we could give him was to lay him where the Sea would carry him away: The re&s;t of our Men were generally &s;o ill and brui&s;ed, that but 4 or 5 of us were able to at|tempt any thing for our &s;afety. This day finding &s;ome more Plank and Canvas &s;ent us a &s;hoar, we built a &s;ort of a Tent, where we hous'd our &s;elves from the Wind and Weather.</P>
<P>The 14<HI>th.</HI> after having Sang a <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> and been at <HI>Prayers,</HI> (which devotion we ob&s;erved every Morning &amp; Evening,) we attempted to get Fire, by rubbing the drye&s;t Sticks of Firr we could get together; which proving ineffectual, we made a &s;ort of a Drill, who&s;e motion was more violent, but our Wood was &s;o water-&s;oaken, that we laboured in vain: and were extreamly pinch'd with the Cold for want of it, in&s;omuch that our Feet &s;well'd, and many of them were nip'd with the Fro&s;t: This e|vening therefore I cut off my Boots, and de&s;ired the Men to get their Shoes off, but &s;o fro&s;t-bitten and bli&s;ter'd were &s;ome of their Legs, that in pul|ling off their Stockings, they fley'd off skin and all; and &s;ome of the Nails of their Feet: which we wrap'd up as warm as we could in O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um &amp; Canvas. This Day the Sea flowing high came into our Tent, and carry'd away part of it; that we were nece&s;&s;ita|ted to remove it to the highe&s;t Craggs of the Rock.</P>
<P>From about this time, (for I can't remember ex|actly the Day of every occurrence) as often as the
<PB N="53" REF="001507_0027_0fb3827292dc9918">
Weather would permit, we hoi&s;ted a Staff &amp; white <HI>Flag</HI> upon our Tent, in hopes that &s;ome Ve&s;&s;el pa&s;|&s;ing by might di&s;cover it. And now the Mercy of God &s;ent us a &s;hoar three &s;mall Chee&s;es, which at the de&s;ire of the Company, I dealt forth daily to every man an equal allowance of.</P>
<P>We began now to build a flat bottom'd float of the Plank &amp; Timber, laying three Plank's width for the bottom, and two up &s;ide, with &s;ome Can|vas like a wa&s;t cloth upon that, to keep the Sea out the better; but &s;o few hands were able to work, and our Carpenter rarely affording his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, becau&s;e of his illne&s;s, it was about the 20<HI>th.</HI> ere we had fini&s;hed it; and the 21<HI>&s;t.</HI> proving moderate Weather, it was agreed that my Mate, with 4 or 5 of the Men with me, &s;hould endeavour to recover the Main, and &s;end a Ve&s;&s;el for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Accordingly, with much ado, we got it down to the Water &s;ide, having fir&s;t Commended our &s;elves and our enterprize to the ble&s;&s;ing of God by earne&s;t Prayer; about Noon we lanched the float, being nece&s;&s;itated to wade deep into the Water to ac|compli&s;h it; but the rowling Surff &s;oon threw us a|long &s;hoar, and over-&s;et us; and it was a great Mercy that we e&s;caped drowning, &s;o feeble were we and unable to help our &s;elves: The Boat pre|&s;ently &s;tove again&s;t the Rock, and tho' our enter|prize was da&s;h'd, and our hopes baulkt, and the lo&s;s of our Ax &amp; Hammer, with the Boat, was great, yet we could not but &s;ee the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God in the mid&s;t of <HI>Judgment,</HI> for in the afternoon, the Wind &s;prang up and blew hard, that had we been at Sea in that <HI>imitation of a Boat,</HI> in all probability we had peri&s;hed; and tho&s;e we were to have left behind
<PB N="54" REF="001507_0028_0fb38274d08d9c20">
would have fared no better becau&s;e unable to help them&s;elves: Thus our <HI>Di&s;appointment</HI> (thro' the goodne&s;s of God) proved our <HI>Safety.</HI></P>
<P>We were now brought into very Mi&s;erable &amp; Me|lancholy circum&s;tances; the men extream Weak, their Feet frozen, with deep Ulcers in their Legs; the very &s;mell of them offen&s;ive to tho&s;e of us that could go into the Air, and nothing to dre&s;s them with but a piece of linnen that was hove up; our &s;mall &s;tock of Chee&s;e &s;pent, and nothing left us to &s;upport Nature but a few <HI>Mu&s;&s;els,</HI> &s;carce, and hard to get, and the <HI>Sea-weed</HI> that grew upon the Rock; we had now the black pro&s;pect of <HI>Starving,</HI> while our Limbs peri&s;hed by piece meals; and we were under the afflicting apprehen&s;ions le&s;t the <HI>Spring Tide,</HI> at the approaching Full Moon, &s;hould be ac|company'd with a high Wind and quite over-flow us; be&s;ides the aggravating Affliction that all the Ve&s;&s;els we &s;aw pa&s;s at a di&s;tance, took no no|tice of our Signal; That we were ready to lye down in de&s;pair, and the mo&s;t of us not &s;o much as hop'd for deliverance: Tho' I endeavoured to en|courage them and my &s;elf to put our Tru&s;t in God, and patiently <HI>Wait for his Salvation</HI>; and I look'd upon it as a great favour, in this Di&s;tre&s;s, that the Mate &s;truck down a <HI>Sea Gull,</HI> which we got and thankfully fed upon.</P>
<P>The la&s;t method of &s;afety we could engage in was to make a <HI>Raft</HI> that would carry Two Men; but the labour of clearing the Fore yard, of which it was chiefly to be made, from the Cable &amp; Junk, was &s;o great, and our <HI>Hands</HI> &s;o few &amp; weak, that it was about the 24<HI>th.</HI> ere we had fini&s;hed it; which proving a moderate Day, with a fine Sea-brieze, we
<PB N="55" REF="001507_0028_0fb38274d08d9c20">
got it down to the Water, and after having made our Supplications to Heaven for Succe&s;s, two of the men, who were more e&s;pecially de&s;irous of ventu|ring, were launched upon it, about two in the Af|ternoon; but the &s;well rowling high over &s;et it, as it had done our Boat; and tho' one of the men (an Engli&s;h man that could not &s;wim) refu&s;ed a &s;econd attempt, yet the other (a <HI>Swede,</HI> who&s;e Feet were &s;o frozen that he was forced to crawl upon his hands &amp; knees to the Water-&s;ide) continued re&s;olute to attempt the &s;hoar, tho' he &s;hould go alone; another of our men encouraged by his re&s;olution undertook to bear him company: after they had put off from us, they de&s;ired me to go to Prayer for them &amp; watch what became of them; I did &s;o; and by that time the evening came on, I tho't they might be half way a-&s;hoar; &amp; the Wind blowing hard about 9 or 10 at night, at <HI>S. E.</HI> I concluded they might reach the &s;hoar by 2 in the Morning; but it &s;eems they fell in with &s;ome breakers, or the violence of the Sea over|&s;et them, &amp; they peri&s;hed; for a day or two after, the Raft was found ca&s;t up, with one man dead, &s;ome di&s;tance from it. We, upon the <HI>de&s;olate I&s;land</HI> not knowing what ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> befallen them, waited daily for deliverance; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur expectations were confirm'd by the &s;moak we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aw in the Woods two days after they left us; which was the &s;ignal I de&s;ired them to make, if they arrived &s;afe; and we look'd upon their delay as occa&s;ioned by not being able to procure a Ve&s;&s;el &s;o &s;oon as we de&s;ired. And this hope under God was all we had to &s;upport us.</P>
<P>About the latter end of this Month, the <HI>Carpenter,</HI> who had been ill ever &s;ince his coming a-&s;hoar, and now having his Feet frozen, an exce&s;&s;ive pain in his
<PB N="56" REF="001507_0029_0fb382764f75bbb0">
back, and &s;uch a &s;tiffne&s;s in his Neck, that he could not &s;tir his head, and almo&s;t choaked with Phlegm, to our apprehen&s;ion drew near his End; towards evening we rai&s;ied his head, and I Prayed over him; he &s;hew'd him&s;elf <HI>Sen&s;ible,</HI> but was <HI>Speechle&s;s</HI>; about Midnight I enquired of them that lay next him, who told me, he was dead.</P>
<P>The next Day pre&s;ented me with the mo&s;t Me|lancholy view of the effects of <HI>Hunger</HI>; for our &s;tarving Company, who had now been for &s;everal Days without any &s;u&s;tenance, but Sea weed and 2 or 3 <HI>Mu&s;&s;els</HI> a day, de&s;iring of me that they might have <HI>his Body</HI> to &s;upport their Lives with: This, of all I had met with, was the mo&s;t &s;hocking to me; to &s;ee us drove to &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity as to eat what &s;eemed to contrary to Nature: I begg'd of God that He would find out &s;ome way for our &s;upport, without feeding upon our <HI>Dead Companion</HI>; but all other means failing, and the Men ince&s;&s;antly cal|ling upon me for it, I was forced to give my con|&s;ent; and their own feeblene&s;s nece&s;&s;itated me, upon their reque&s;t, to prepare it for them the be&s;t manner I could, that they might not all peri&s;h with hunger. I gave them &s;ome of it that Night; and the next day &s;uffered them to Eat what they would of it; but finding &s;ome very ravenous, I was forced to keep watch over it, and let them have only their daily Portion; lea&s;t, ere we obtain'd our delive|rance, this &s;hould be &s;pent, and we be obliged to feed upon the <HI>Living.</HI></P>
<P>It having plea&s;ed God, in Mercy to us, to put it into the hearts of &s;ome People, where the Raft was ca&s;t a &s;hoar, to come upon the &s;earch; the &s;ight of a Ve&s;&s;el on the Morning of the 2<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>January</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="001507_0029_0fb382764f75bbb0">
half way from the &s;hoar, &s;tanding directly for us, made our hearts leap within us: When they came within Call, I de&s;ired them to vere a Buoy to me, and I would fa&s;ten my &s;elf to the End of the Rope, and they &s;hould hale me on board; (for the &s;well would not &s;uffer them to venture to the Rock) but expecting &s;moother Water, they hovered about the I&s;land till Noon; when I told them we were peri&s;hing for want of <HI>Fire,</HI> which we had been without all this cold &s;ea&s;on; at length one of the Men came a-&s;hoar in his &s;mall Canoo, and gave us the refre&s;hment of a <HI>Fire</HI>; I thought to have gone on board with him, but the rowling Surff over-&s;et the Canoo, and I was glad to tarry to dry my &s;elf; and the Man, after waiting for a favourable &s;natch, till near Sun &s;et, was forced to go without me, the Canoo not being able to carry us both in &s;uch a &s;well.</P>
<P>It was an uncomfortable &s;ight to &s;ee the Shallop &s;tand away for the &s;hoar without us: but that Night proving &s;tormy Weather, our Good Friends lo&s;t their <HI>Ve&s;&s;el,</HI> tho' they Saved their <HI>Lives</HI>; but had <HI>we</HI> been with them, our feeblene&s;s would hardly have &s;uffered us to have e&s;caped: So that &s;till the <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> of God is to be &s;een in our <HI>Di&s;appointment.</HI></P>
<P>Upon their arrival, they &s;ent an expre&s;s to <HI>Port&s;|mouth</HI> in <HI>Pi&s;cataqua</HI>; but the next day continuing very bad Weather, was a great addition to our &s;orrows, and tryal of our Patience. Tho' we were &s;atisfyed the People a-&s;hoar knew of our mi&s;erable Condition, yet our fle&s;h now failing, and no drink all this while but the bracki&s;h Water in the Crags of the Rock, and our Tent rendred uncomfortable by the blinding Smoak, and the Weather &s;uch as
<PB N="58" REF="001507_0030_0fb3827bacf55a88">
we knew none could come to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance while it la&s;ted, made our hearts to fail within us; and the <HI>near pro&s;pect</HI> we had had of deliverance, gave us but &s;o much the more unea&s;ine&s;s at the <HI>delayes</HI> of it.</P>
<P>But it plea&s;ed God that in the Night the Wind abated, and by Sun ri&s;e the 4<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>January,</HI> we had a Shallop come for us, with Captain <HI>Long,</HI> and Captain <HI>Furbur,</HI> who were very brisk in getting us on board, and kind in their treatment of us. That Night about 8 a clock we arrived at <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> where we were very civilly received, and the kind People there made a Collection for the relief of my men: and tho' my Boy neglecting to pull off his Shoes, as I ordered, had his Feet &s;o &s;woln and black that I never expected he would have the u&s;e of them again, was forced the next day to have half of one of his Feet taken off, yet thro' the won|derful Mercy of God, he and all the Men are in a likely way of recovery: My own Health and Stength by the di&s;tingui&s;hing Goodne&s;s of God, having been continued to me the whole of our Twenty four Dayes Mi&s;ery, beyond Expectation.</P>
