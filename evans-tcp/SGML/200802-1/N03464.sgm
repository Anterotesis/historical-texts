<P>_WE are Now, thro' the Sparing, Up|holding, and Supplying Mercy of our God, arriv'd to the Expiration of <HI>our</HI> FIRST CENTURY, &s;ince, the <HI>glori|ous Head</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> has had a <HI>Church</HI> in this Place.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing that our <HI>Anniver&s;ary Solemnity</HI> of THANKSGIVING, hap|pens near upon the Conclu&s;ion of &s;uch a Period; I hope that it may prove both <HI>acceptable</HI> and <HI>profitable,</HI> to e&s;&s;ay &s;ome religious Improvement of both in a Di&s;cour&s;e from the Words now read.</P>
<P>You may not expect a large and particular Account of our <HI>Foundation, Ri&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Growth</HI>; for to do this, would be to give you a Hi&s;tory, more proper for your Entertainment at other Times, than &s;uch as are con|&s;ecrated to God's &s;olemn Wor&s;hip, and for other Places than from the Pulpit.</P>
<P>Neither will my Acquaintance either by <HI>private Records,</HI> or <HI>particular traditional Accounts,</HI> with the &s;pecial Circum&s;tances of the <HI>Original</HI> and <HI>Progre&s;s</HI> of this TOWN and CHURCH, furni&s;h me with Matter for &s;uch an Undertaking</P>
<P>Nothing further therefore than &s;ome brief Hints &s;hall be attempted; by all which I De&s;ire and Hope, that GOD may have the Glory of His <HI>Wi&s;dom, Power, Goodne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Faithfulne&s;s,</HI> in what He has done for Us; in rai&s;ing from &s;mall Beginnings &s;uch Enlarge|ments as at this Day: In appearing for us in our

<P>I would al&s;o have this &s;pecial View in the whole, to <HI>inform</HI> and <HI>in&s;truct</HI> our Children, <HI>the Generation of our Hopes</HI>; and to rai&s;e in their Minds, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">ble <HI>Di&s;po&s;itions</HI> of Piety, and <HI>Re&s;olutions</HI> of Godline&s;s, to honour the God of their Fathers, and to cleave to him with full Purpo&s;e of Heart, who did &s;uch great Things for our <HI>Fore-Fathers,</HI> and therein al&s;o, for <HI>us</HI> and <HI>them</HI>; that with Souls full of Love and Zeal and Gratitude, they may &s;ay and re&s;olve, <HI>He is our God, and we will prai&s;e him; he was our Fathers God, and we will exalt him: This God &s;hall be our God for ever and ever; we will &s;et our Hope in him, and not forget his Works, but keep his Commandments</HI></P>

<P><HI>This P&s;alm</HI> of which our Text is a Part, is <HI>Hi&s;tori|cal,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Henry.</NOTE> it is a Narrative of the <HI>great Mercies</HI> which God had <HI>be&s;towed</HI> upon <HI>I&s;rael; the great Sins</HI> with which they had <HI>provok'd</HI> him, and the <HI>many Tokens</HI> of divine Di&s;plea&s;ure which they <HI>had been under</HI> therefor.</P>
<P>In the foregoing P&s;alm, the holy Prophet had been relating <HI>God's Wonders of old,</HI> for his own <HI>Encourage|ment</HI> in a difficult Time. <HI>In this</HI> he re&s;umes the Sub|ject for the <HI>Edification</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> and enlargeth much upon it; &s;hewing not only <HI>how good</HI> God had been to them, which was an Earne&s;t of further fini&s;h|ing Mercy; <HI>but</HI> how <HI>ba&s;ely</HI> they had <HI>carried</HI> them&s;elves to God, which <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> him in <HI>correcting them,</HI> as he did at this Time, and <HI>forbad</HI> all their Complaints.</P>
<P>Our Text is a <HI>Preface</HI> to this Piece of <HI>Church Hi&s;to|ry,</HI> commanding the Attention of the then <HI>pre&s;ent Age,</HI> and recommending it to the Study of <HI>the Generations to come.</HI></P>
<P>And in the <HI>Front</HI> of this <HI>Preface,</HI> the holy P&s;almi&s;t <HI>demands Attention</HI> to what he was about to deliver. The People of God are call'd upon to hearken to God's Law, his Will and Word: <HI>Give Ear, O my People, to my Law.</HI> Some make the&s;e the P&s;almi&s;t's Words; <HI>Da|vid</HI> as a King, or <HI>A&s;aph</HI> in his Name, as his <HI>Secratary</HI> of State, or <HI>Scribe</HI> to the &s;weet Singer of I&s;rael, here calls upon the People as his People, committed to his Charge, <HI>to give Ear to his Law</HI>: He calls his In&s;truc|tions <HI>his Law</HI> or <HI>Edict.</HI> Such was their commanding Force in them&s;elves; every good Truth receiv'd in the Light and Love of it, will have the Power of a Law upon the Con&s;cience.</P>
<P><HI>From this Example</HI> of the royal P&s;almi&s;t we may note; <HI>That tho&s;e that are in civil Authority, would do well, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with that Liberty in which Chri&s;t hath made us free, to interpo&s;e their Power for
<PB N="5" REF="004236_0009_100428007084C6C0">
the Edification of the People of God.</HI> Or the P&s;almi&s;t being a Prophet &s;peaks as God's Mouth, and &s;o calls them his People, and demands Subjection to what was &s;aid, as to a Law. <HI>Let him that hath an Ear, thus hear what the Spirit &s;aith unto the Churches</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hence</HI> we may <HI>ob&s;erve</HI> this Note of DOCTRINE, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q>That the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t ought in his Name to call upon the People of God, committed to their Charge, to hearken to his Law, his Will and his Word.</Q>
<P>God's <HI>Law</HI> is his <HI>Will,</HI> reveal'd in his <HI>Word</HI>; to this God's People ought to hearken; that is, to <HI>&s;ubmit</HI> to the Power and Authority of it, and <HI>to yield</HI> a chearful Obedience to it. <HI>And to this Exerci&s;e of Godline&s;s,</HI> the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t ought to quicken and &s;tir up the People of God under their Care and Watch: <HI>To this we are directed</HI> by the Example in our Text; for what was written afore Time was written for our In&s;truction and Admonition: The Writings of the Old and New Te&s;tament were given by In&s;piration of God, &amp; that for our Learning; <HI>For they are profitable for Doctrine, for Re|proof, for Correction, and In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s; that the Man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furni&s;h'd unto every good Work.</HI> And agreeably &s;ays the Apo&s;|tle <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>James</HI> 5.10.</NOTE> <HI>Take my Brethren, the Prophets who have &s;poken in the Name of the Lord, for an Example:</HI> And this we &s;hould do, not only in their <HI>Sufferings,</HI> and in their <HI>Patience,</HI> but al&s;o in their <HI>holy Living,</HI> their <HI>examplary Conver&s;ation,</HI> and <HI>imitable Services</HI> to the People of God, in the <HI>fulfilment</HI> of <HI>their Commi&s;&s;ion.</HI> We &s;hould be Followers of them, wherein they have been Exam|ples of the Things which are <HI>Virtuous</HI> and <HI>Prai&s;e worthy</HI> and of <HI>good Report</HI>; of <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> of Life, of <HI>Purity</HI> of Doctrine <HI>Zeal</HI> for God, and <HI>Faithfulne&s;s</HI> in fulfilling the Mini&s;try committed to them, and in Di&s;charge of their Office as <HI>Watchmen</HI> upon the Wall.</P>

<P>Hence then by Way of <HI>Application,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>We &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ary and incumbent Duty both of Mini&s;ters and People.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Let us now, in God's Name and Fear, apply our|&s;elves to that which the Lord our God requires of us, in our re&s;pective Characters.</HI> And now; may the <HI>glo|rious Head of the Church,</HI> abundantly <HI>furni&s;h</HI> me with his <HI>Word,</HI> from Time to Time, <HI>agreable</HI> to your more <HI>&s;pecial Circum&s;tances,</HI> a Word of <HI>In&s;truction, Reproof, Exhortation,</HI> and <HI>Coun&s;el</HI>: and having <HI>God's Word</HI> may I be enabled to &s;peak <HI>his Word</HI> in the <HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> and with <HI>Power,</HI> agreable to the <HI>lively Ora|cles,</HI> with <HI>Seriou&s;ne&s;s, Gravity,</HI> and <HI>Solemnity,</HI> and with &s;pecial and pertinent <HI>Application</HI> to the <HI>State</HI> and <HI>Condition</HI> of <HI>your Souls,</HI> &s;eeking your Good, your <HI>&s;piri|tual Profit</HI> and <HI>Advantage,</HI> your <HI>Edification</HI> and <HI>Salva|tion,</HI> and not any <HI>vain Glory</HI> or <HI>Applau&s;e</HI> of Men; <HI>you</HI> al&s;o being my <HI>Helpers,</HI> by your <HI>fervent Addre&s;&s;es</HI> to God for me, that I may <HI>obtain Grace</HI> to be <HI>faithful,</HI> and <HI>find Mercy</HI> of the Lord to be <HI>&s;ucce&s;sful.</HI> Thus to &s;erve you and your's (by the Help of God) is my <HI>earne&s;t De&s;ire,</HI> in what may be attempted, in the <HI>following Articles</HI> of <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> upon this <HI>Occa&s;ion,</HI> that God's Name may be glorified, and our Souls nouri&s;h'd by the &s;incere Milk of the Word.</P>

<P>Hence we may ob&s;erve this Note of <HI>Doctrine, viz.</HI></P>
<Q>That God's Word and Providences, the Ordinances, Com|mandments, and Laws of his Kingdom, both of Na|ture and Grace, are Things of infinite Moment and Concern to us.</Q>
<P>Herein is contained the Whole of Man, re&s;pecting his <HI>pre&s;ent u&s;eful Being,</HI> and his <HI>future Comfort and Hap|pine&s;s.

God's Word</HI> contains all Things nece&s;&s;ary for him to know, believe, and practice, in order to his Fruition of the be&s;t Good, which will never end, after a Period is put to his &s;hort Abode in this World. <HI>God's Providences</HI> are Di&s;coveries of his Wi&s;dom and Power, and of his Kindne&s;s and Favour in <HI>upholding all Things,</HI> and in their <HI>univer&s;al Government,</HI> wherein he many Times &s;hews him&s;elf &s;trong, on the Behalf of them that fear him; and &s;ometimes for their In&s;truction and Ad|monition; and to vindicate the Honour of his own Holine&s;s and Ju&s;tice, he di&s;plays his Indignation in the Executions of his Wrath upon bold and incorrigible Sinners.</P>
<P>And in all this, wherein the <HI>Ordinances, Command|ments,</HI> and <HI>Laws,</HI> of the Kingdom of Nature and Grace are exhibited and di&s;played to us, there are Things of <HI>infinite Moment</HI> and <HI>Concern</HI> to us; Things great and weighty and worthy of our <HI>Con&s;ideration</HI> and <HI>utmo&s;t di|ligent Attention:</HI> For what can concern us more, than to know <HI>God</HI> and <HI>our&s;elves,</HI> our <HI>Duty</HI> and our <HI>Happi|ne&s;s.</HI> More particularly,</P>

<P>All that the <HI>glorious God</HI> &s;ays and does in his Word and in his Works, is agreable to the Perfection of his Nature: And &s;o far forth as they refer to us, they are for our <HI>In&s;truction</HI> and <HI>Direction, Rule</HI> and <HI>Government</HI>; that we may know God and our Duty, and be kept from the abominable Things which his Soul hates, and be pre&s;erved in his Love and Favour; which mu&s;t needs render the&s;e Things of infinite Moment to us. <HI>But in a Word, for I can but ju&s;t mention what might be enlarg'd upon,</HI></P>

<P>This is the <HI>grand End,</HI> which the <HI>great God propo|&s;es</HI> in all the <HI>Exertments</HI> of him&s;elf, viz. <HI>his own Glory,</HI> He made all Things, he upholds all Things, he or|ders and di&s;po&s;es of all Things as he plea&s;es, and all for the Advancement of his own Honour; and the Re|velation which he hath made of him&s;elf in his written Word, is in the fir&s;t Place for the &s;ame glorious Pur|po&s;e, for God can have no higher End than him&s;elf, who is the fir&s;t and the la&s;t, the beginning and the End. <HI>And &s;ubordinately</HI> he <HI>propo&s;es</HI> the <HI>Good</HI> of <HI>his Creatures,</HI> and will make every Thing to work toge|ther for the Good of his Cho&s;en.

<P>This is con&s;i&s;tent with the highe&s;t Rea&s;on, and we can have nothing to object again&s;t it.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence how profitable &s;uch an Attention to the Word and Works of God would be to us.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Way to engage the favourable Pre&s;ence of God with us, in which alone our Safety, Comfort, and Succe&s;s is comprehended; and this is the Way to be receiv'd to the Rewards of Grace, in which is the Life of our Souls, and the Happine&s;s of Eternity: See the Rea&s;onablene&s;s, Plea&s;ure, and Profit of Obedi|ence.</P>

<P N="2">2 Another Rea&s;on given in our Text to urge the Peoples Duty upon them, in attending to the <HI>In|&s;tructions</HI> and <HI>Admonitions</HI> which were to be given to them in God's Name, <HI>viz That the Things which were to be di&s;cours'd of, were of ancient Date.</HI></P>
<P>They were the Monuments of Antiquity, dark Say|ings of old, <HI>which we have heard and known, and which our Fathers have told us</HI> They are Things of undoubt|ed certainty, <HI>We have heard them and known them</HI>; and there is no Room left to que&s;tion the Truth of them.</P>

<PB N="13" REF="004236_0017_100403BCC0648660">
There is both <HI>Profit</HI> and <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> in being inform'd of Things of ancient Date, that are of <HI>undoubted Verity,</HI> and of <HI>Moment</HI> and <HI>Importance.</HI></P>
<P>Hence we may ob&s;erve this Note of <HI>Doctrine, viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That it is a very agreable and u&s;eful entertainment to refre&s;h our Minds with the Remembrance of what God has done for us in our Day, and with his Dealings to|wards our Ance&s;tors, which were perform'd in the Days of old; in the Times of ancient Generations.</HI></P>
<P>It is exceeding plea&s;ant to ingenious and inqui&s;itive Minds to reflect upon the <HI>Ob&s;ervables of divine Pro|vidence,</HI> within the Compa&s;s of their <HI>own Knowledge</HI>; and al&s;o to be entertain'd with tho&s;e of <HI>ancient Date,</HI> which were remark'd in the <HI>Days</HI> of their <HI>Fore Fathers.</HI></P>

<P>Wherefore I pa&s;s to &s;ay, that it may be a very u&s;e|ful and profitable Entertainment to reli&s;h our Minds with what God has done for us in our Day, and with his Dealings towards our Ance&s;tors, which were per|form'd in the Days of old; and to &s;how that in &s;everal Ways, and for &s;everal Ends and Purpo&s;es it may be &s;o.</P>
<P>Particularly,</P>

<P>Again</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>To &s;tir up in us a holy Fear of God and a Dread of his Wrath</HI></P>
<P>Among the Purpo&s;es of Heaven in the Di&s;coveries of the divine Di&s;plea&s;ure, in the Executions of Ven|geance, this is one, <HI>that others may hear and fear,</HI> may thereby be admoni&s;h'd and take Warning. We ought to fear that holy and dreadful Name, the LORD OUR GOD. We &s;hould have &s;uch an Aw of the Maje&s;ty of Heaven&punc; and &s;uch a Dread of his Wrath, as to make us very cautious of doing any Thing to provoke him to come forth again&s;t us in Anger Now a <HI>&s;erious Reflection</HI> upon what God has done, either in our own Day, or in ancienter Times, to puni&s;h his People for their Rebellions again&s;t him, may have, and &s;urely it ought to have this <HI>Influence</HI> and <HI>Effect</HI> upon us, thro' a holy Fear of God, to <HI>avoid</HI> tho&s;e <HI>Ways</HI> and <HI>Practi|ces</HI> which were &s;o provoking to the God of Heaven, that for the Honour of his great Name, he hath vi&s;ited his People with &s;ore Judgments and Calamities. This is particularly intimated to us in our Text, ver. 8. &mdash; <HI>and might not be as their Fathers, a &s;tubborn and rebellious Generation, a Generation that &s;et not their Heart aright, and who&s;e Spirit was not &s;tedfa&s;t with God.</HI> Further,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This may be of U&s;e and Service to excite our Love, and increa&s;e our Gratitude to the ever ble&s;&s;ed God</HI></P>

Appearances</HI> of divine Favour, call for more <HI>peculiar</HI> and <HI>enlarged Returns</HI>: And many &s;uch there have been, if we did but duly attend to them in our own <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and in the Days of our Fathers, which are very loud Calls to us, to love the Lord our Pre&s;erver and Benefactor, and to render to him, our grateful Ac|knowledgments, according to the Benefits done unto us And a <HI>due Reflection</HI> upon the&s;e Things may have a <HI>&s;pecial Tendency</HI> to &s;tir us up to our Duty herein, and thereby greatly turn to our Advantage.

<P>Again,</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>To encourage us to put our Tru&s;t in God, and to make him our Hope and Confidence at all Times.</HI></P>
<P>He that has deliver'd can deliver, and if our Ways plea&s;e him he will yet deliver He has been, and is, the <HI>Hope of his I&s;rael, and their Saviour in Times of Trouble</HI>; great and marvellous have been his Works of Salvation; and the Lord Jehovah is &s;till an inex|hau&s;tible Fountain of Goodne&s;s, and in him there is everla&s;ting Strength. And this is one End of &s;uch a Re|flection, particularly pointed at in our Text, ver. 7. <HI>That we might &s;et our Hope in God.</HI> If we make God's Commandments our Rule, we may make his Covenant our Stay, for he is never unmindful thereof.</P>
<P>Further,</P>
<P N="5">5 <HI>Such a Reflection may be of great U&s;e and Service, to awaken in us a &s;uitable Care, to conform our Tempers and Manners to the holy Will and Law of God, that we may engage his gracious Pre&s;ence with us, and obtain his Ble&s;&s;ing upon us.</HI></P>
<P>This has been God's Manner, he will be with his People in a Way of Mercy and Ble&s;&s;ing, while they adhere to him in a Way of Duty and Obedience. This we are a&s;&s;ur'd of, from the Declarations of God's Word, and from the Hi&s;tory and Method of his provi|dential Di&s;pen&s;ations: thus we read, 2 Chron. 15 1, 2. <HI>And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the Son of Obed, and he went out to meet A&s;a, and &s;aid unto him,
<PB N="16" REF="004236_0020_1004282565AA3E10">
Hear ye A&s;a, and all Judah and Benjamin, the Lord is with you while you be with him, and if you &s;eek him, he will be found of you.</HI> Wherefore if we regard the Favour of Heaven, and in that our own Intere&s;t, &s;uch a &s;erious Reflection will have a Tendency to engage our Regards to the Will and Law of God, a|greable to which are tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages in our Text, v. 5.6. and 7. <HI>For he e&s;tabli&s;hed a Te&s;timony in Jacob, and appointed a Law in I&s;rael, which he commanded our Fa|thers, that they &s;hould make them known to their Chil|dren. That the Generation to come might know them, even the Children which &s;hould be born: Who &s;hould a|ri&s;e and declare them to their Children. That they might &s;et their Hope in God, and not forget the Works of God; but keep his Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>In a Word.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>A &s;uitable Review of the great and good Things which the ever ble&s;&s;ed God hath done in our Day, and in the Days of our Fathers, may be of U&s;e and Benefit to our Po&s;terity, that they may inform'd of the Works of God, and call'd upon, not to forget the Hope of their Fa|thers, nor be unmindful of his Law</HI>; which for Encou|ragement duly to ob&s;erve, he has &s;o &s;ignally appear'd in Ways of Mercy; and for the Breach of which, he hath come forth in Anger, and marched thro' the mid&s;t of his People in Indignation.</P>
<P>But this Advantage of a due Notice of the Remark|ables of Providence, is to be the Subject of a di&s;tinct Head, and therefore may be more particularly con&s;i|der'd by and by.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore only add here, upon the whole of what has been offer'd under this Note of Doctrine, That for &s;uch &s;acred Purpo&s;es as the <HI>In&s;truction</HI> and <HI>Ad|monition</HI> of the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> and <HI>&s;ucceeding Generations,</HI> in the Fear, and Love of God, and Obedience to his Law; we have many In&s;tances in our Bibles, of Re|hear&s;ing the wonderful Works of God both pre&s;ent and former.</P>

<P>Agreably it is added in our ancient Records.</P>
<P>"It was thought meet and agreed upon, that all the Inhabitants that affected Church Communion, or plea&s;|ed to come, &s;hould meet every 5th Day of the Week at &s;everal Hou&s;es, in order lovingly to <HI>di&s;cour&s;e</HI> and <HI>con&s;ult</HI> together of &s;uch Que&s;tions as might further tend to &s;tabli&s;h a peaceable and comfortable civil So|ciety; and prepare for &s;piritual Communion in a Church State. <HI>Partly</HI> that we might be further acquainted with the <HI>Tempers,</HI> Spirits and Gifts of one another; and <HI>partly</HI> that we might gain further Light in the Ways of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, and the Government of his Church." &amp;c.</P>
<P>And in the Pur&s;uit of this Method, they prepar'd for, and at length came into a Church State in a very &s;e|rious and &s;olemn Manner.</P>

be&s;towed on them according to his Mercies, and ac|cording to the Multitude of his Loving kindne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But in a Word,</P>
<P N="6">6 <HI>The great Goodne&s;s of God towards our Fathers and towards us &s;hould animate us to u&s;e our utmo&s;t Endea|vours, that our Children may be &s;uitably affected with the&s;e Things.</HI></P>
<P>But this brings me</P>
<P N="3">3 To <HI>con&s;ider</HI> the third and la&s;t Rea&s;on given in our Text, to urge the People's Duty upon them in attending to the In&s;tructions, and Admonitions that were to be given to them in God's Name, viz. <HI>That they were Things in which Po&s;terity was concern'd.</HI></P>
<P>Ver&s;e 4th and on of our Text, <HI>We will not hide them from their Children, &s;hewing to the Generation to come, the Prai&s;es of the Lord, and his Strength, and his wonderful Works that he hath done; for he e&s;tabli&s;h|ed a Te&s;timony in Jacob, and appointed a Law in I&s;rael, which he commanded our Fathers, that they &s;hould make them known to their Children, that the Generation to come might know them, even the Children which &s;hould be born, who &s;hould ari&s;e and declare them to their Children, that they might &s;et their Hope in God, &amp; not forget the Works of God, but keep his Commandments, and not be as their Fathers, a &s;tubborn and rebellious Generation, a Generation that &s;et not their Heart aright, and who&s;e Spirit was not &s;tedfa&s;t with God.</HI></P>
<P>The Things which the Prophet was about to Di&s;|cour&s;e of, as they were Things <HI>weighty,</HI> and the <HI>Mo|numents</HI> of <HI>Antiquity,</HI> &s;o they were to be <HI>tran&s;mitted</HI> to <HI>Po&s;terity</HI>; <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Henry.</HI></NOTE> and it lies as a Charge upon us, carefully to hand them down. <HI>Becau&s;e our Fathers told them us,</HI> we will not hide them from their Children: Our Chil|dren are called <HI>their's,</HI> for they were in Care for their <HI>Seed's Seed,</HI> and look'd upon them as their's. And in teaching our Children the Knowledge of God, we re|pay to our Parents &s;ome of that Debt owe to them
<PB N="37" REF="004236_0041_1004286A9FB55328">
for teaching us. Nay if we have no Children of <HI>our own,</HI> we mu&s;t declare the Things of God to their Chil|dren, the Children of others; our Care mu&s;t be for Po&s;terity in general, and not only for <HI>our own</HI> Po&s;teri|ty. And for the <HI>Generation to come</HI> hereafter, the Chil|dren <HI>that &s;hall be born,</HI> as well as the Generation that is next ri&s;ing up, and the Children that <HI>are born.</HI> That which we are to tran&s;mit to our Children, is not only the Knowledge of Languages, Arts, and Sciences, their Liberty and Property; but e&s;pecially <HI>the Prai&s;es of the Lord,</HI> and <HI>his Strength</HI> appearing <HI>in the wonder|ful Works that he has done.</HI> Our great Care mu&s;t be to lodge our Religion, that great <HI>Depo&s;itum,</HI> pure and entire in the Hands of tho&s;e that &s;ucceed us.</P>
<P>Hence we may ob&s;erve this <HI>Note</HI> of DOCTRINE, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That we ought to do all that is in our Power, to have the Souls of our Children impre&s;s'd with &s;uitable Appre|hen&s;ions of God, his Will and Law, and their Duty; to effect which, the Rehear&s;al of, and acquainting them with, God's memorable providential Di&s;pen&s;ations, whe|ther of ancienter or later Date, may have an agreable Tendency.</HI></P>
<P>Here let it be &s;aid,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We &s;hould u&s;e our utmo&s;t Endeavour, that our Children may be &s;uitably affected with the Law of God, his Will, and their Duty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He e&s;tabli&s;hed a Te&s;timony in Jacob, and appointed a Law in I&s;rael, which he commanded our Fathers, that they &s;hould make them known to their Children,</HI> v. 5. <HI>The Law of God</HI> was given to his People, with a par|ticular Charge, that it &s;hould be taught diligently to their Children. <HI>He e&s;tabli&s;hed a Te&s;timony</HI> or Covenant, and erected a Law in <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael</HI>; gave them Precepts and Promi&s;es, which he <HI>commanded them to make known to their Children.</HI> See Deut. 6.7. <HI>And thou &s;halt teach them diligently unto thy Children, and &s;halt talk of them when thou &s;itte&s;t in thine Hou&s;e, and when thou walke&s;t by the Way, and when thou lie&s;t down, and when thou ri&s;e&s;t up.</HI> See al&s;o Ver&s;e 20, and on. <HI>And when thy Son asketh thee in Time to come, &s;aying, What
<PB N="38" REF="004236_0042_1004286FBB583708">
mean the Te&s;timonies, and the Statutes, and the Judg|ments which the Lord our God hath commanded you; then &s;halt thou &s;ay unto thy Son, We were Pharaoh's Bonamen in Egypt, and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty Hand, and the Lord &s;hewed Signs and Wonders, great and &s;ore upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his Hou&s;hold, before our Eyes; and he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the Land which he &s;ware unto our Fathers. And the Lord commanded us to do all the&s;e Statutes, to fear the Lord our God, for our Good always, that he might pre|&s;erve us alive, as it is at this Day; and it &s;hall be our Righteou&s;ne&s;s, if we ob&s;erve to do all the&s;e Commandments, before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.</HI></P>
<P>The Church of God, as the Hi&s;torian &s;aith of the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Common-wealth, was not to be <HI>Res unius aetatis,</HI> a Bu&s;ine&s;s of one Age, but was to be kept up, from one Generation to another. And therefore, as God provided for a Succe&s;&s;ion of Mini&s;ters in the <HI>Tribe of Levi,</HI> and the <HI>Hou&s;e of Aaron,</HI> &s;o he appointed that Parents &s;hould train up their Children in the Know|ledge of his Law; and when they are grown up, they mu&s;t <HI>ari&s;e and declare them to their Children</HI>; that as one Generation of God's Servants and Wor&s;hippers pa&s;&s;eth away, another Generation may come, and <HI>the Church,</HI> as <HI>the Earth,</HI> may <HI>abide forever.</HI> And thus GOD's Name among Men may be as the <HI>Days of Heaven.</HI> And then,</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>The Rehear&s;al of God's memorable providential Di&s;pen&s;ations to our Children, and &s;uitably acquainting them therewithal, may have a happy Tendency thus to impre&s;s the Law of God upon them.</HI> His Providences both of Mercy and Judgment.</P>
<P>It is requi&s;ite that <HI>God's Works</HI> &s;hould be <HI>made known</HI> to Po&s;terity, together with his <HI>Laws</HI>; the fulfilling of his Promi&s;es made to the Obedient, and his Threat|nings denounced again&s;t the Di&s;obedient: Let the&s;e be told to our Children, and to our Children's Chil|dren.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="004236_0043_10042872891A4E98">And hence they may <HI>take Encouragement,</HI> to con|form them&s;elves to the <HI>Will of God,</HI> that not <HI>forgetting the Works of God</HI> wrought in former Days, or later Times, they may <HI>&s;et their Hope in God,</HI> and <HI>keep his Commandments,</HI> may make his Command their Rule, and his Covenant their Stay. And tho&s;e only may with Confidence <HI>hope for God's Salvation,</HI> that make Con|&s;cience of <HI>doing his Commandments.</HI> The <HI>Works of God,</HI> duly con&s;idered, will very much &s;trengthen our Re&s;o|lution, both to <HI>&s;et our Hope in him,</HI> and to <HI>keep his Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>And then, hence may Children <HI>take Warning,</HI> to conform to tho&s;e <HI>Examples of their Fathers</HI> which have not been good, and for which God hath vi&s;ited them with his &s;ore Rebukes, <HI>that they might not be as their Fathers, a &s;tubborn and rebellious Generation.</HI></P>
<P>When the Character of Fathers is, that they are <HI>&s;tubborn and rebellious,</HI> that they walk contrary unto God, who tho' they profe&s;s Relation to him, yet do not &s;et their Hearts aright; are not cordial in their Engagements to God, nor inward with him in their Wor&s;hip of him, and therefore their <HI>Spirits are not &s;ted|fa&s;t with him,</HI> but upon every Occa&s;ion fly from him: Children &s;hould <HI>take Warning</HI> not to follow <HI>their Ex|amples.</HI></P>
<P>And verily tho&s;e that are de&s;cended from wicked and ungodly Ance&s;tors, if they will but con&s;ider the Word and Works of God, will &s;ee Rea&s;on enough not to tread in their Steps: 'Twill be no Excu&s;e for <HI>a vain Conver&s;ation,</HI> that it was <HI>receiv'd by Tradition</HI> from our Fathers, for what we know of them that was ill, and the Puni&s;hments that they receiv'd therefor, &s;hould be an Admonition to us, that we dread that which was &s;o pernicious to them.</P>
<P>In fine. Such an Acquaintance with the Dealings of Heaven, may have a Tendency <HI>to fill</HI> our <HI>Children</HI> with an <HI>holy Awe</HI> and <HI>Reverence</HI> of the <HI>divine Maje&s;ty</HI>; with a <HI>chearful Hope</HI> and <HI>Confidence</HI> in him; with <HI>earne&s;t De&s;ires</HI> and a <HI>&s;teady Care</HI> to plea&s;e him. by obeying his Will; with <HI>awful Fears</HI> of offending
<PB N="40" REF="004236_0044_10042875C3BC5838">
him, by any In&s;tances of Di&s;obedience; <HI>and in a Word,</HI> this may in&s;truct and quicken them <HI>to fear, love, &s;erve,</HI> and <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> that God who was <HI>their Father's God,</HI> and is <HI>their God,</HI> and who they de&s;ire may be <HI>the God</HI> of their's after them.</P>
<P>Hence by Way of <HI>Application.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We learn the Duty of Parents to in&s;truct their Children in the knowledge of God's Word and Works; of His Law and Providence.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hould teach them diligently to our Children: We &s;hould talk of them when we &s;it in the Hou&s;e, when we walk by the Way, when we lye down and when we ri&s;e up. We &s;hould acquaint our Children with what God hath done for his People, for his Churches, for our Families, for our&s;elves, and for them. What Sen&s;e they &s;hould have of divine Mer|cies, and how they &s;hould re&s;ent the Tokens of divine Di&s;plea&s;ure. What Improvement they &s;hould make of &s;uch Things to &s;tir them up to Holine&s;s of Life, and to direct their Hearts into the Love of God, and a pa|tient Waiting for the Mercy of God, thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence we learn the Duty of Children to hearken to and receive Inctructions; to regard God's Works and obey his Will.</HI> And to lay up &s;uch Things as a &s;acred Depo&s;itum to be tran&s;mitted down to their Po&s;terity; and to have their own Hearts &s;uitably impre&s;s'd, and their Lives influenc'd to an agreeable Conver&s;ation by the Examples of God's Mercies, and Judgments. His <HI>Smiles</HI> upon <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Vertue,</HI> and his <HI>Frowns</HI> upon <HI>Impiety</HI> and <HI>Di&s;hone&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>In a Word,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Let what has been offer'd upon this Subject, have this Influence and Effect upon us; to quicken us to regard the Works of the Lord, and to con&s;ider the Operation of his Hands in the Methods of his Providence towards us, and towards our Venerable and Renowned Forefa|thers</HI>

<P>"We who&s;e Names are &s;ub&s;cribed, having found by woful Experience, the Un&s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s of our Hearts with God, and Pronene&s;s to go a&s;tray from his Ways, (for which we de&s;ire to aba&s;e and humble our&s;elves in his Pre&s;ence) and de&s;iring to be joined forever to the Lord, and to cleave together in &s;piritual Love and Communion, according to his holy In&s;titutions, that we might enjoy in his Name &s;uch holy Helps as the

<P>We do therefore, in the Name and Pre&s;ence of God, and of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and before his People here a&s;&s;embled, &s;olemnly enter into Covenant with the Lord our God profe&s;&s;ing and acknowledging the Lord Je&s;us, our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, to be the only Prie&s;t, Pro|phet, and King of his Church, and (thro' the Help of his Grace) his only Merit we re&s;t upon for our Par|don and Peace with the Father, his only Teaching and righteous Government, with all the ble&s;&s;ed Ordi|nances of his Kingdom. We do embrace and &s;ubmit unto in all Things, as the only Rule of our Lives; renouncing all our own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, with all the Doctrines, Devices, and Commandments of Men, not agreeing with his holy Word; e&s;pecially all the &s;uper&s;titious and tyrannous Commands of Antichri&s;t, and his Adherents, wherein we have in any kind been entangled; profe&s;&s;ing &amp; promi&s;ing (thro' the Help of his rich &amp; free Grace) henceforth not to live unto our&s;elves, but unto the Lord Je&s;us, who hath bought us with his Blood, avoiding carefully all &s;uch Things as be of|fen&s;ive to his Maje&s;ty, and di&s;honourable to our Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of his Name, with all &s;uch dangerous Tempta|tions as our &s;inful Hearts are wont to be drawn a&s;ide withal, in &s;pecial, the inordinate Cares of, and Entan|glements in, the Affairs of this Life: Promi&s;ing and profe&s;&s;ing al&s;o, thro' the Help of the Lord, to live together in this our holy Fellow&s;hip, according to the Rule of Love, in all holy Watchfulne&s;s over each o|ther, and faithful mutual Helpfulne&s;s in the Ways of God, for the &s;piritual and temporal Comfort and Good of one another in the Lord; and all to the &s;etting forth of the Prai&s;e of his rich Grace in Chri&s;t&punc; who hath called us, in his abundant Mercy, to this holy Fellow&s;hip with his Maje&s;ty, and one with another."</P>

<P><PB N="48" REF="004236_0052_100403D13356F1C0"><HI>N. B.</HI> In the Time of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Adams,</HI> upon the 23d Day of <HI>May</HI> 1683, the Church &s;olemnly re|newed their Covenant, and in the doing of it, they made &s;ome very nece&s;&s;ary and weighty Additions to the former.</P>
<P>The <HI>Renewal</HI> of <HI>Covenant</HI> is thus <HI>Prefac'd.</HI></P>
<P>"We who thro' the exceeding Riches of the Grace and Patience of God, do yet continue Members of this Church, being now a&s;&s;embled in the holy Pre|&s;ence, and in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, after humble Confe&s;&s;ion of our manifold Breaches of Cove|nant before the Lord our God, and earne&s;t Supplica|tion for pardoning Mercy, thro' the Blood of Chri&s;t, and due Acknowledgment of our great Unworthine&s;s to be own'd as the Lord's Covenant People, al&s;o ac|knowledging our Inability to keep Covenant with God, or to perform any &s;piritual Duty, unle&s;s the Lord Je&s;us do enable us thereunto, by his Spirit dwelling in us. And being awfully &s;en&s;ible that it is a dread|ful Thing for &s;inful Du&s;t and A&s;hes per&s;onally to tran&s;act with the infinitely glorious Maje&s;ty of Heaven and Earth; We do in humble Confidence of his gra|cious A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Acceptance thro' Chri&s;t, each one of us, for our&s;elves, and jointly as a Church of the living God, explicitly renew our Covenant with God, and one with another, in Manner and Form follow|ing."</P>
<P>Then follows the <HI>Form</HI> of <HI>Covenant</HI> before writ|ten; to which is added the following Para|graphs, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>"And whereas there are many Evils that are grown too common in this Land; &s;o far as we or any of us have been guilty of any of them, we de&s;ire from our Hearts to bewail it before the Lord, and humbly to entreat for pardoning Mercy, for the &s;ake of the Blood of the everla&s;ting Covenant. And as an expedient unto Reformation, of whatever Evils have provoked the Eyes of God's Glory among us, We do &s;ubjoin unto our Church Covenant, a further Engagement, whereby we do in the Pre&s;ence of God promi&s;e"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="004236_0053_1004289534B78B60">"That we will (by the Help of Chri&s;t) endeavour every one of us to reform his own Heart and Life, by &s;eeking to mortify all our Sins, and endeavouring to walk clo&s;ely with God, to uphold the Power of God|line&s;s, to keep holy the Lord's Day, and reverently and carefully to attend upon the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Word and Ordinances of Chri&s;t, and all Parts of his Wor&s;hip (whether publick or private) according as in the Word of God it is required of us to do."</P>
<P>"We promi&s;e al&s;o (by the Help of Chri&s;t) to walk before God in our Hou&s;es with an upright Heart, taking Care that God be con&s;tantly call'd upon by Prayer, and that the Scriptures be frequently read in them, and that we will endeavour to perform all Duties required of us towards our Children, for their &s;piritual Good, both by our Example, In&s;truction, and Government, and Prayers for them."</P>
<P>"We do further engage (the Lord helping of us) to endeavour that we may be pure from the Sins of the Times, &s;uch as neglect or Profanation of the Wor&s;hip and In&s;titutions of Chri&s;t, Sabbath-brea|king, vain and &s;inful Company-keeping, mi&s;pending of Time, exce&s;&s;ive Drinking, wanton and loo&s;e Behavi|our, failing in Truth, uncharitable and unrighteous Cen&s;uring, &s;inful Tale-bearing, corrupt Communicati|on, Pride, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and the like; and in our Places to endeavour the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of them. And that we will make Con&s;cience to walk &s;o, as that we may not give Occa&s;ion to others to Sin, or to &s;peak evil of our holy Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Now that we may ob&s;erve and keep this &s;acred Covenant, and all the Branches of it inviolable for ever, we de&s;ire to deny our&s;elves, and to depend wholly upon the eternal Spirit of Grace, and upon the free Mercy of GOD, and the Merit of JESUS CHRIST, and when we &s;hall fail, there to wait upon the <HI>Lord Je&s;us</HI> for Pardon and for Acceptance, and for Healing, for his Name Sake."</P>
<P><HI>It is added,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="004236_0054_100403D468E27DE0">"This Form of Covenant being made openly in the Congregation after Sermon and Prayers in the Forenoon, the Brethren of the Church te&s;tified their Con&s;ent thereto by lifting up the Hands, and the Si&s;ters by ari|&s;ing up from their Seats."</P>
<P>And now (my dearly beloved Brethren) <HI>Let us re|member the Vows of God that are upon us:</HI> Let us often read over, and &s;eriou&s;ly reflect upon our Covenant En|gagements: Let us humbly lament before God all that Breach of Covenant, which we are chargeable withal, and cry mightily for pardoning Mercy thro' the Blood of the everla&s;ting Covenant. And that the holy God, would not avenge upon us the Quarrel of his broken Covenant. And, O that for the Time to come we might have a more con&s;tant and &s;teady Regard to our Covenant-Engagements, and walk worthy of the Lord unto all well plea&s;ing. Unto which let this Covenant (now in our Hands, and O that it was writ|ten on our Hearts) be a <HI>con&s;tant</HI> and <HI>continual</HI> MONITOR.</P>
<P>Let not the LORD our GOD abhor us to de&s;troy us, but remember the <HI>Covenant</HI> of our <HI>Ance&s;tors</HI> &mdash; Hav|ing entred into a Covenant to &s;eek the Lord God of our Fathers, with all our Heart, and with all our Soul; let us in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner renew the Bonds with which we have bound our Souls, and like the Men of Judah, rejoice at the Oath: Having &s;worn with all our Heart, let us &s;eek God with our whole De&s;ire.</P>
<P>And let us be careful to bring our <HI>Children</HI> under the <HI>Wing</HI> of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> and the <HI>Bonds</HI> of the <HI>Cove|nant,</HI> that we may plead <HI>Covenant Mercy</HI> for <HI>them,</HI> and have a <HI>Covenant-Hope</HI> for our <HI>Off&s;pring.</HI></P>
<P>And for our Encouragement, let us remember, <HI>that all the Paths of the Lord are Mercy and Truth unto &s;uch as keep his Covenant, and his Te&s;timonies &mdash; The Mercy of the Lord is from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting upon them that fear him, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s unto Chil|dren's Children; to &s;uch as keep his Covenant, and to tho&s;e that remember his Commandments to do them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="004236_0055_1004289AA9156CF0"><HI>Ye that fear the Lord, tru&s;t in the Lord; he is their Help and their Shield. The Lord hath been mindful of us, he will ble&s;s us, he will ble&s;s the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael, he will ble&s;s the Hou&s;e of Aaron, he will ble&s;s them that fear the Lord, both &s;mall and great. &mdash;The Lord &s;hall increa&s;e you more and more, you and your Children&mdash;You are the ble&s;&s;ed of the Lord that made Heaven and Earth; the Heaven, even the Heavens are the Lord's, but the Earth hath he given to the Children of Men.</HI></P>
