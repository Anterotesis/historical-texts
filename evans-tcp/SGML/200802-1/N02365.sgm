<P>IT is an approved Maxim, <HI>That every wi&s;e Man propo&s;es an End in all his De&s;igns and Actions.</HI> Hence it follows, That from the De&s;ign and End of &s;uch Actions they may be denominated Good or Ill.</P>
<P>It was given out here at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> that there was a Piece in the Pre&s;s, intended as an An&s;wer to <HI>Ways and Means,</HI> &amp;c. [a little Book which had been the Subject of Con|ver&s;ation &s;ome Time before.] At la&s;t it came out under the Title of <HI>A Dialogue &s;hewing what's therein to be found.</HI> I confe&s;s I was at fir&s;t at a Lo&s;s to find a Meaning to it; and after further Peru&s;al, could find nothing to the Purpo&s;e; nor any Thing like Argument to di&s;prove any Thing contain'd in <HI>Ways and Means</HI>; That being a Probatio|nary E&s;&s;ay upon Trade, not dogmatically determining, but mode&s;tly &s;ubmitted to the Judicious for Amendment, Probation, or Confutation, as better Judgments might &s;ee Cau&s;e. But this Performance, without &s;hewing any rea&s;onable Cau&s;e, makes the &s;aid Book, which was the Author's &s;incere Endeavours for a publick Good, to be on|ly a Subject of Drollery, Deri&s;ion and Con|tumely, and that in a very ungenteel Man|ner,

all which I &s;hall wipe off by the en&s;u|ing Lines.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t I &s;hall here remark the Occa&s;ion of my fir&s;t &s;etting Pen to Paper, <HI>viz.</HI> Some Years &s;ince, &s;ome ingenious Per&s;ons and Well-wi&s;hers to their Country's Happine&s;s, when they &s;aw the Province near the Brink of Ruin, occa&s;ion'd by the encoura|ging in&s;tead of clogging the injurious Parts of Trade, (Foreign Liquors e&s;pecially) and di&s;regarding our own Product and Manu|factures, as <HI>Iron, Homp, Malt,</HI> &amp;c. the chief Dependance of the Country being on the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Market, which was glutted with &s;uch great Quantities of Bread and Flour that often &s;old cheaper there than they were bought here; and the Price here &s;o low, that the Husbandman could &s;carce live by his Labour, much le&s;s extricate him&s;elf from the Incumbrances which ma|ny lay under; Silver and Gold, (the Ca&s;h we had in the Country) continually drain'd by our Wine-Trade (and &s;ometimes for Rum when it would purcha&s;e that Commodity better than Bread and Flour,) and making Remittances till the little we had left, was &s;till decrea&s;ing, and &s;erv'd rather to deba&s;e the Price of our Vendibles than help Trade.</P>
<P>Then it was that tho&s;e Well-wi&s;hers to their Country, exerted them&s;elves to make
<PB N="5" REF="002807_0004_0fe63f38f8199280">
&s;ome E&s;&s;ays for its Relief, and to open the Eyes of the People. The fir&s;t was, <HI>Some Remedies,</HI> then a <HI>Dialogue betwixt</HI> R. Rich <HI>and</HI> R. Plowman, and other Manu&s;cripts, which were &s;uch clear Di&s;plays of the lan|gui&s;hing State of the Country, that the People generally &s;en&s;ible thereof, and of the Exigencies and Straits they labour'd under, did by their Repre&s;entations and Petitions to their Repre&s;entatives in A&s;&s;em|bly, obtain from the Legi&s;lature (according to the Practice of our Neighbouring Colo|nies of <HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>New-York</HI>) a Paper-Credit or Currency: How far it has an|&s;wer'd the Ends propo&s;ed, is obvious to all judging Men, who do not wilfully &s;hut their Eyes.</P>
<P>The Manner of Emi&s;&s;ion being by a pub|lick Loan-Office, where every Man that had an E&s;tate in Fee, free of Incumbrance, might by mortgaging the &s;ame to the &s;aid Office, be admitted to take out half the Value of &s;uch E&s;tate, not exceeding the Sum re&s;tricted &s;o long, as any Bills re|mained in the Office, without Preference to one above another.</P>
<P>Thus Numbers of Inhabitants who&s;e E&s;tates had lain dead, were furni&s;h'd with Stock for Trade, or to lend to others who&s;e Inclinations led them thereunto, which gave the quicke&s;t Pu&s;h to Trade that has been known for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> before.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002807_0005_0fe63f38fa1074c8">But the Con&s;ideration of our <HI>We&s;t-India</HI>-Market, being over &s;tockt with Bread and Flour, and for that Rea&s;on grown very low, as is before noted, put me on Thoughts of contributing to that Good, tho&s;e bene|volent Per&s;ons had &s;o happily begun, and from like good Will to my Country, &s;et Pen to Paper at &s;ome Spare-Hours.</P>
<P>This I did by an E&s;&s;ay &s;tiled <HI>Ways and Means,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Humbly &s;ubmitted to the Legi&s;la|tive Authority of the Governments on</HI> Delaware, wherein I demon&s;trated it to be the un|doubted Intere&s;t of all tho&s;e Colonies to pre&s;erve a good Under&s;tanding betwixt them&s;elves in Matters of Trade, as mo&s;t conducive to their mutual Benefit, hoping it might excite their Concurrence. And I have under&s;tood, than many are fully con|vinced from the Arguments the&s;e advanc'd, how much it will be their Intere&s;t to come into tho&s;e Mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>It was put out without a Name, and the Printer under an Obligation of Secre&s;y: The Rea&s;on of &s;uch Injunction was, That as we are unhappily in Parties, the Preju|dices too often ari&s;ing from thence, might not fru&s;trate the good De&s;ign and End thereof; which was not that minute Thing, <HI>the Name of an Author,</HI> as the <HI>Dialogi&s;t</HI> is &s;o little and vain to &s;ugge&s;t. Whence he takes his Mea&s;ures, I know not, unle&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="002807_0006_0fe63f4200c962b0">
from him&s;elf. And as I have el&s;ewhere &s;aid, &s;o I now again &s;incerely aver, to have no other View but the publick Good and Intere&s;t of tho&s;e Colonies in the&s;e Under|takings; maugre the Sugge&s;tion of <HI>Simon,</HI> or any other malevolent Per&s;on what&s;oever. For what thinking Man can judge other-ways, but that it mu&s;t be the Effect of Ill-will thus to je&s;t, &s;coff and deride (in&s;tead of confute) the hone&s;t Intention of the E&s;&s;ayer, which, tho' it &s;hould not have effectually done the Good intended, or had not repre&s;ented the State of tho&s;e Colonies &s;o exactly, or had not propo&s;ed &s;o effec|tual Remedies for our Calamities, as &s;ome abler Hand might have done; yet might have excited &s;uch an one to do it better: Nor could it po&s;&s;ibly be of ill Con&s;equence to any, carrying with it no Manner of Re|flection on the Conduct of any Man, either in a publick or private Capacity, keeping my &s;elf &s;o within the Bounds of Mode&s;ty and Indifference, as might free me from the Bya&s;s of Party-Heat, and render what I did, lea&s;t obnoxious to Cavil.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all my Precaution, and without any Provocation or Rea&s;on that I know of, out comes the comical <HI>Dia|logue,</HI> on purpo&s;e, no Doubt, to prevent its intended Service. <HI>Dialogue</HI> is a Way of writing mo&s;t liable to Exceptions of any,
<PB N="8" REF="002807_0007_0fe63f4202a49320">
e&s;pecially in Controver&s;y; for unle&s;s the Writer is a Man of great Integrity and Ju|&s;tice, he may make his Antagoni&s;t &s;peak Non&s;ence, and put a Sen&s;e on his Words which he never meant; repre&s;ent him in|con&s;i&s;tent, contradictory, contemptible, or what el&s;e he plea&s;es, as to Fact, or Opi|nion; and by that Art, form &s;uch mon&s;trous Ideas of his Adver&s;ary, in the Minds of People, as may beget invincible Prejudice to the be&s;t of Per&s;ons and Things; repre&s;ent his Adver&s;ary by a Man of Straw of his own making, and then fight with it.</P>
<P>How far the <HI>Dialogi&s;t</HI> is culpable in tho&s;e or other Re&s;pects, is what I have to &s;hew in the&s;e Examinations of his Performance, and &s;hall accordingly denominate his Cha|racter as a Ju&s;tice to my &s;elf, and my ho|ne&s;t Intentions in that E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>In the Per&s;on of <HI>Simon,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>He loves Dialogue,</HI> and makes that his Option which every one has a Right to do as well as to choo&s;e the Subject. And if he had kept to the ju&s;t Rule of Dialogue, I &s;hould not fault him for That&mdash; He tells us next, <HI>'Tis commended of old.</HI> To this I accede, for it is as ancient as <HI>Ari&s;tophanes</HI> the Comedian, who by his ludicrous Wit, rendred <HI>Socrates</HI> contemptible to the People, of whom he de|&s;erved much better Treatment, being e&s;teem|ed one of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of Men in that

Age of the World. And tho' I have no Rea&s;on to think <HI>the Eight-penny B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ok</HI> will be le&s;s e&s;teemed by any &s;ober and judicious Reader for tho&s;e repeated Scorfs and Re|proaches from this merry Performance, any more than <HI>Socrates</HI> was for the Shower ca&s;t on him by <HI>Xantippe:</HI> Yet le&s;t any &s;hould take Railery for Rea&s;oning, and Jeer for Argument, I &s;hall as briefly as may be, re|mark on the Vanity of the <HI>Dialogi&s;t.</HI> What I have thus far in general &s;aid, may &s;erve for Remark on the Dialogue to <HI>Page</HI> 10, for I &s;uppo&s;e no intelligent Per&s;on will judge it de&s;erves a particular Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, being a continued Scene of Drollery, which may be ca&s;t on the mo&s;t &s;olemn Di&s;cour&s;e, and is as much a Satyr on the be&s;t of Mankind, as on <HI>Ways and Means; "Vertue is her own Re|ward</HI>; with much more before and after; but this only as a Specimen of a great Part of the Work, which, I doubt not, but all &s;ober Readers will cen&s;ure; therefore &s;hall &s;ay no more to that Part. But finding it difficult to trace the <HI>Dialogue</HI> under parti|cular Heads, the &s;ame Thing being tran&s;|per&s;s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in divers Parts of the Book without any Coherence; therefore I &s;hall remark on &s;everal Pages together, unle&s;s the Ca&s;e o|therways requires.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 10. The <HI>Dialogi&s;t</HI> has a Pa&s;&s;age, which being in a different Character, I take to be
<PB N="10" REF="002807_0009_0fe63f45dcd85e70">
a Citation out of <HI>Ways and Means,</HI> which runs thus, <HI>That the Generality of People are &s;o addicted to them</HI> (Rum <HI>and other Spirits</HI>) <HI>that neither Regard to publick Intere&s;t or private, Bo|dy or Soul, will divert them from the frequent &V;&s;e of it.</HI> To which he &s;ubjoins, <Q>And yet tho&s;e very Dictators mi&s;s very few Days in the Week, wherein they do not begin in the Morning with that ruinous new Invention of <HI>White Bitter,</HI> and compleat the Evening, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The &s;ole Dictator of that Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Ways and Means,</HI> is the &s;ame Per&s;on and Rea&s;on that now dictates my Pen, and I di&s;claim and reject this In&s;inuation as a gro&s;s Calum|ny, and &s;o far is it from Truth, That in a Series of above nine Septinaries of my Age, (nigh Forty Years whereof I have &s;pent in this Country) I was never guilty thereof one Day; and I doubt not, but mo&s;t Rea|ders who know me, will be my Witne&s;&s;es, &s;o far as they have Knowledge of my Con|duct.</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 11. the <HI>Dialogi&s;t</HI> entertains his Rea|der with a Fable of a <HI>Steward,</HI> without gi|ving the Moral, which he continues, to near the End of the 12th <HI>Page,</HI> where, in an Ironical Manner, he &s;ays, <Q><HI>Why put together a Parcel of clever Words, talk of</HI> Mediums, <HI>of</HI> Com|merce, Ballance of Trade, Publick Good, Funds, Loans, Striking, Sinking, <HI>and &s;uch like, no Matter whether under&s;tood or not by our

&s;elves or others, or whether we rea&s;on well and clearly, &s;o as we make a fine Gingle.</HI></Q> He would do well to let us know whence he makes this Inference.</P>
<P>That the&s;e Terms are proper to the Subject then di&s;cours'd of, no Man of a common Under&s;tanding will deny: And if they had been unapplicable to the Occa&s;i|on, impertinent or improperly apply'd to the Subject, it would very well become his Sagacity to detect its erroneous Applica|tion. But it's pre&s;um'd, That was too dif|ficult a Task. And therefore pa&s;&s;es it off with a Scoff, <HI>No Matter.</HI></P>
<P>We have the like Quirks of Wit in other Places; for from the abundance of Science or Conceit, he will allow the re&s;t of his Neigh|bours &s;o &s;mall a Pittance of Under&s;tanding, as if, to u&s;e his own Words in another Ca&s;e, he had <HI>monopolis'd a Character,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The 14<HI>th Page</HI> is &s;pent in <HI>Suppo&s;ition, Conjecture, Imagination</HI> and <HI>Phantoms,</HI> con|cerning Paper-Money; no otherways intel|ligible (to that Scantling of Under&s;tanding he e'en now allow'd me) than a Scarecrow to frighten the Farmer and Trade&s;men; for, &s;ays he, <HI>on tho&s;e the Burthen, which at fir&s;t &s;eem'd to be thrown on others, will fall,</HI> mean|ing the Farmer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But he may &s;ee, if hell plea&s;e to open his Eyes, than Paper-Money will at this Time build Ve&s;&s;els, pur|cha&s;e

<P><HI>Page</HI> 15. The <HI>Dialogi&s;t</HI> proceeds, <HI>I cannot but ob&s;erve the many Incon&s;i&s;tences in the Opi|nions, not only of divers, but the &s;ame Per&s;ons. At fir&s;t &s;ome were po&s;itive the Value of the Currency would not fall; Now they &s;ee it,</HI> &amp;c. I am not accountable for the Opinion of tho&s;e divers Per&s;ons: But where he &s;aith, <HI>the &s;ame Per&s;on will tell us in one Place it was far &s;hort, in another, that Exce&s;s of it will inevita|bly deba&s;e the Value,</HI> to an ordinary Capacity will appear no Incon&s;i&s;tency; and to avoid dwelling the Di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall refer the Reader to <HI>Page</HI> 6, and 58 of <HI>Ways and Means,</HI> whence tho&s;e Citations &s;eem to be taken, and will &s;ufficiently atte&s;t their Con&s;i&s;ten|cy with all Men, who will not be impos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d on with empty Sounds.

<P><HI>Page</HI> 26. He ca&s;ts his Javelin at <HI>Ways and Means</HI>; but only &s;trikes a Man of Straw of his own making, thus; <HI>I was &s;o &s;imple as to imagine it intended that I &s;hould believe that laborious, indu&s;trious People</HI> (&s;uch as <HI>Palatines</HI>) <HI>are to make us rich without Extent of Land or its Fertility, or a great deal of its Produce; and even without People</HI> (&s;imply) <HI>and that without all the&s;e, Wheat, Hemp, and all the enumerated, are to be rai&s;ed and produced.</HI></P>
<P>This I conceive is his <HI>Logical</HI> Inference on the <HI>Negatives,</HI> to which he adds an Irony
<PB N="22" REF="002807_0021_0fe63f698bd19e98">
on the Word (<HI>&s;mith</HI>) which Word was hap|pily added; for without it, he might have had &s;ome Ground for Cavil; for my plain Meaning was, That a great Number of idle and profligate Per&s;ons, of <HI>Convicts, and the Scum of Goals,</HI> &amp;c. were not the Riches of a Country, and no judicious Per&s;on can &s;up|po&s;e they are.

If his Prejudice to <HI>Palatines</HI> had not &s;owred his Temper, he could never have made &s;uch Deductions from my Words in <HI>Ways and Means,</HI> pag. 11. <HI>as put in the Front, monopo|lize a Character</HI>; for 'tis plain to any unpre|judiced Man, That indu&s;trious and labori|ous People, <HI>Palatines,</HI> and others, are there oppo&s;ed to Convicts, or Scum of Goals, of which many have come of late, and in all Probability may do no more Good here, than in the Places from whence they came, But indu&s;trious, hone&s;t People are beneficial to the Publick, increa&s;e Trade and Manu|facture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> tho' here is nothing of Prefe|rence given to <HI>Palatines,</HI> above <HI>prior Inha|bitants</HI>; nor are they &s;o much as brought in Competition with the fir&s;t Settlers and Improvers of the Province.

and Labours of the prior Inhabitants,</HI> 'tis ea&s;y to convince them of the contrary.</P>
<P>I &s;hall further ob&s;erve on the <HI>Dialogi&s;t</HI> a Quibbles on the Word <HI>Negative,</HI> which are &s;o often repeated with Banter and Ridi|cule, the only Weapons of a Sort or Men to laugh tho&s;e out of Countenance whom they cannot refute. But I appeal to the Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of Rea&s;on for the Authority of tho&s;e Examples I brought to &s;upport my Po&s;ition, and add in Defence of the <HI>For|mality</HI> of my Argument, in <HI>Ways and Means,</HI> That as every Man has Liberty to write in what Method he thinks may be mo&s;t intel|ligible, I &s;hall ju&s;t fie that manner of Ar|gument by Examples from &s;acred Writ, of much elder Date than the Dialogi&s;t's <HI>fa|&s;hionable Sermons of the middle of the la&s;t</HI> Century. I &s;hall begin with our Savi|our<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Di&s;cour&s;e with the Woman of <HI>Sama|ria,</HI> who&s;e Que&s;tion concerning the Place of Wor&s;hip was an&s;wered by two Negatives, <HI>viz.

The next Example I cite is the fir&s;t <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> which, by &s;ome is thought to be de&s;igned by the Penman, as a Preface to that Book, where the Beatitudes there mention'd are predicated by three Negatives, <HI>Walketh not

in the Coun&s;el of the &V;ngodly, nor &s;tandeth in the Way of Sinners; nor &s;itteth in the Seat of the Scornful.</HI> Then it's added in Contradi&s;tin|ction: <HI>But his Delight is in the Law of the Lord:</HI> And if the Dialogi&s;t had not &s;ate in the Seat of the Scornful; but had delight|ed in that Law, whether Internal or Ex|ternal, I per&s;wade my &s;elf he would not have found &s;uch Plea&s;ure in his Perform|ance; all the Examples of this Kind in the &s;acred Writings are too numerous to in&s;ert here.</P>
<P>But to recur to &s;ecular Matters, in re|lation to the Word <HI>Negative.</HI> Suppo&s;e one &s;hould ask me, which is the be&s;t Form of Government, I would an&s;wer negative|ly thus;</P>
<P>'Tis not a <HI>Tyranny.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis not an <HI>Oligarchy.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis not an <HI>Olocracy.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e being Names we borrow from the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who wrote of Politicks, I would next proceed to a Definition thus: A Ty|ranny is, when a &s;ingle Per&s;on governs by an ab&s;olute Power, for his own private Good, as in <HI>France.</HI> But where a &s;ingle Per&s;on governs for the publick Good, that is called a <HI>Monarchy,</HI> as in <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>Oligarchy</HI> is, where a Number govern for their own private Good, as at <HI>Athens,</HI> under the thirty two Tyrants; and at <HI>Rome,
<PB N="25" REF="002807_0024_0fe63f7389e0a7f0">
Fir&s;t</HI> under the <HI>Decemviri,</HI> and next under the' two <HI>Triumvirates</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, which made Way for en&s;laving the free&s;t People in the World, and &s;uch at this pre&s;ent are the Lords of <HI>Poland,</HI> where the Subjects are Va&s;&s;als.</P>
<P>But where a Number govern for the Good of the whole, that is called an <HI>Ari&s;|tocracy,</HI> as in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>Olocracy</HI> is the Mi&s;-rule of a Multi|tude, or a Rabble, as at <HI>Naples,</HI> under <HI>Ma&s;&s;anello.</HI> But where the Multitude rule well, and for a common Good, this is cal|led a <HI>Democracy</HI>; but the&s;e are generally on the Brink of Confu&s;ion, and &s;eldom of long Continuance.</P>
<P>Having thus di&s;play'd, <HI>Negatively</HI> and <HI>Po&s;itively,</HI> the Vices and Vertues of the &s;e|veral Forms of Government from as good Authors as any among&s;t us, who &s;et up for Politicks, I conclude a Government happily con&s;tituted, as the Monarchy of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of a limited <HI>Mo|narchy,</HI> a noble <HI>Ari&s;tocracy,</HI> and a ju&s;t and prudent <HI>Democracy,</HI> This, in An&s;wer to the Que&s;tion, I pronounce (with Ance&s;tral Zeal,) the be&s;t Form of Government, where it is practicable.</P>
<P>From <HI>Page</HI> 27, to 33. is a long Digre&s;&s;i|on on Oeconomy, which I like very well, for the mo&s;t Part; and if it were generally

<P><HI>Page</HI> 35. <HI>I have indeed been &s;unk in my Spirits, and ready to weep at the melancholy Pro&s;pect before us.</HI> There is certainly Cau&s;e of Complaint of Levity, Rudene&s;s and Ex|ce&s;s at many Times of Concour&s;e, as at Fairs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and too often in private Com|panies: But I would hope better of tho&s;e others there mention'd. But the <HI>Dialogi&s;t</HI> &s;eems to de&s;pair of a Reformation, leaving Things too indefinitely at the wor&s;t for mending.
