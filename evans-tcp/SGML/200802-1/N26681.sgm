<Q>THERE THE WICKED CEASE FROM TROUBLING, THERE THE WEARY ARE AT REST. THERE THE PRISONERS BEST TOGETHER, THEY HEAR NOT THE VOICE OF THE OPPRESSOR, THE SMALL AND THE GREAT IS THERE, AND THE SERVANT IS FREE FROM HIS MASTER.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE rivers and firearms which run along the &s;urface of our globe, are all equal in their original; whither we con&s;ider them in them&s;elves, or. In the com|mon, cau&s;es from whence they all ari&s;e. Some puny fountain, or contiguous mountain taught them at fir&s;t to flow: but in their cour&s;es along, the earth, they &s;oon become di&s;tingui&s;ed by ten thou&s;and accidents.</P>
<P>SOME &s;carce i&s;&s;ued from their parent &s;pring&s;, are &s;well|ed with &s;nows, and augmented bv the continual acce&s;&s;ion of numberle&s;s &s;treams, until at length a&s;&s;embled together from all quarters, in mighty bodies, they roll over the world with &s;uperior maje&s;ty. Others, unaided by the&s;e accidental cau&s;es, admit but of &s;mall increa&s;e, and run a|long in the &s;ame humble channel. But this &s;tate of things, however, is not of long duration. They are all to meet finally in one place. After having run their ap|pointed cour&s;es, and di&s;played for &s;ome little time, their different forces, they fall all into the &s;ea, their common receptacle: there their waters are blended, their courles lu&s;t and even their names unknown: thus, as they were equal in their original, they are again equal in their end.</P>
<P>THIS is a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of human life&mdash;men as: they &s;tand in nature are equal; they are equal when they fir&s;t enter into life, in every material circum&s;tance: but as they advance, this equality is gradually dimini&s;hed, and at length, &s;eemingly altogether de&s;troyed. Some in the cour&s;e of their progre&s;s, are augmented with birth, with riches, honors, titles and &s;ame: others are endewed with
<PB N="4" REF="035491_0005_1004DEB3D249C340">
none of all the&s;e acqui&s;itions, but continue in their fir&s;t humble ob&s;curity. Some are happy, are fortunate, live in the mid&s;t of ea&s;e, of health, of mirth; and jovial plea|&s;ures; others are unhappy, unfortunate, pre&s;&s;ed with ma|ny calamitie&s;, have their health impaired, and their &s;pi|rits broken: but neither does this &s;tate of things conti|nue long; a few years of this &s;cenery elap&s;ed, and death re&s;tores the equality again, and renders the appearane of human affairs once more uniform.</P>
<P>THIS view of the event, is truly intere&s;ting to two of polite &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of men, to them who are &s;ufferers by the pre|sent inequality which prevails in life, the pro&s;pect of its abolition mu&s;t be a favourite &s;ubject of contemplation. It mu&s;t be &s;o in a &s;till higher degree, when the&s;e &s;uffer|ings are brought upon them by the oppre&s;&s;ive exertions of human power, and when they con&s;ider it as not only deli|vering them from their troubles by placing them beyond the reach of their oppre&s;&s;ors; but as di&s;arming their op|pre&s;&s;ors them&s;elves of that power, which they &s;o greatly abu&s;ed, and reducing them to a level with the&s;e over whom they tyranized. How infinitely pathetic and beau|tiful is this meditation of Job in the text, how deeply foun|ded in the original feelings of our nature.</P>
<P>WHILST overwhelmed with mi&s;erv and extreme de&s;|pair, he is repre&s;ented as looking forward to the grave as his la&s;t re&s;ource; con&s;idering it as a place where the long lo&s;t equality of nature &s;hall be again re&s;tored, where the wicked &s;hall cea&s;e from troubling, where the weary &s;hall re&s;t from their toils, where the long confined pri&s;oner &s;hall be &s;et at liberty, and where tyranny &s;hall oppre&s;s no more. To the oppo&s;ite cla&s;s of men again, to tho&s;e who are gainers by the pre&s;ent inequality which prevails in life, the pro&s;pect mu&s;t appear in a different light, and pro|duce a different effect upon their &s;entiments.</P>
<P>BUT in this di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall confine my&s;eIf to the fir&s;t cla&s;s; and con&s;ider the grave in the &s;ingle light of a re|lief to the opre&s;&s;ed; and in doing this I &s;hall follow the order of the text, and ob&s;erve the following method.</P>
<P N="1">I. I SHALL con&s;ider the grave as a place where the wicked cea&s;e from troubling.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="5" REF="035491_0006_1004DEB557BEFEA8">II. I SHALL con&s;ider it as a place where the weary are at re&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">III. I SHALL con&s;ider it as a place where the di&s;tinc|tion of life are leveled, where nature re&s;umes her rights, and where all men are again replaced in their original e|quality.</P>
<P N="1">I. I AM to con&s;ider the grave as a place where the wicked cea&s;e from troubling. I mean not at pre&s;ent to ad|dre&s;s the di&s;&s;ipated and the gay, unacquainted by their own experience with the troubles of life, they can know them only by the information of others; and this information &s;hould any one be particular enough to offer it, they may li&s;ten to or not, as they are di&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE troubles of the world are heard at a di&s;tance and affect not their repo&s;e; they may cea&s;e or continue with|out di&s;turbing their &s;y&s;tem, or producing any material ef|fect upon their &s;entiments. It is you, my brethren, who like my&s;elf have been tried and troubled, whom I now mean to addre&s;s&mdash;Come then let us de&s;cend into the grave, and view the &s;ilent man&s;ions where the wicked on|ly can de&s;pair.</P>
<P>AND in the fir&s;t place, in viewing the realm&s; of the dead, ob&s;erve the profound quiet which reigns there. &mdash;More &s;till than the unruffled &s;urface of the deep, the face of this mighty empire is tranquil, and all is &s;olitude and &s;ilence.</P>
<P>HERE is no inva&s;ion of property, or a di&s;pute about the limits which divides one man's territory from another. But every one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es his own narrow hou&s;e, nor feels a wi&s;h, nor can make a motion to tran&s;plant him&s;elf into that of another.</P>
<P>Is &s;trife then cea&s;ed? is di&s;cord no more? can the wicked no longer trouble? No, my friends, they can troub|le no more:, like them your oppre&s;&s;ors &s;hall al&s;o be laid low; like them they &s;hall cea&s;e from troubling, and you &s;hall be delivered.&mdash;That voice which founds to dreadful in your ears, &s;hall fail nor be able to awake the &s;aint echo of the tomb. Where ye wicked is now your power? Ye oppre&s;&s;or, is your rage di&s;armed? Can you cea&s;e to in&s;ult

tho&s;e, over whom fortune has given you the advantage? No, but death hath interpo&s;ed, &amp; his &s;tern orders mu&s;t be complied with; whether you incline or not, you mu&s;t re|&s;ign your power and cea&s;e from your oppre&s;&s;ion. Of all the appearances which this world exhibits there is none which affords a larger fund of mortifying &s;peculation, than to &s;ee one man presuming to oppre&s;s another. In a mind mere|ly philo&s;ophical, it rai&s;es curio&s;ity; in a mind &s;en&s;ible and hone&s;t, it excites &s;urpri&s;e; in mind capable of the noble re&s;entment of virtue, it rou&s;es indignation. A&s;k that man who &s;queezes the hard wrought labourer, what right he has to oppre&s;s his brethren? A&s;k him what the unhappy creature has done to forfeit his favour? O! he will tell you he is idle and unworthy of favour. This I grant may be true in &s;ome in&s;tances; but I fear that it is rather an apology for oppre&s;&s;ion; the lurking motive more com|monly is, that few favours are done in this world but from &s;elfi&s;h motives, and when your benefactor receives not the return which he expected, he is di&s;appointed and chagrined &mdash; This is not benevolence on the part of the be&s;tower, it is an ab&s;olute bargain for value to be received, it is ta|king a man at an advantage, and making your own terms with him; it is a racit compact, but of which you have not &s;o much as a &s;u&s;picion of the motive. A di&s;intere&s;ted benefactor is never di&s;appointed. I maintain that &s;etting gratitude, good offices reward them&s;elves, and if na|ture is not forced, every return which is in the power of a grateful heart will be made&punc;</P>
<P>BUT if the&s;e motives affect you not, let me &s;ugge&s;t one which you mu&s;t feel. In a life &s;o &s;hort as this, why would you oppre&s;s? you will not long enjoy the plea&s;ure, if you think it one of hearing the widow mourn; before you can tear his garments from the orphan, before he is reduced to &s;uch a &s;tate, as to render your enjoyment complete, the delu&s;ion flies. You your&s;elves are low and need that mer|cy which you now refu&s;e to others. Yes! my affected friends, the period of their oppre&s;&s;ion is &s;hort, and the more violently they drive, the more rapidly they will ap|proach to the end of their cour&s;e; there they will cea&s;e from troubling, their inexorable hearts will beat no more. Free among the dead, you will enjoy that repo&s;e you are deprived of here, nor ever more be &s;ubject to their au|thority. For,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="035491_0008_1004DEB8910C49D0">II. THE grave is a place where the weary are at re&s;t&mdash;The weary are at re&s;t! How &s;oothing is the &s;enti|ment? There is &s;omething in the expre&s;&s;ion which affect&s; the heart with uncommon &s;en&s;ations, and pro|duces a &s;pecies of delight, where tranquility is the only ingredient! To be delivered from trouble, to be relieved from oppre&s;&s;ion, to be freed from care and pain, from &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s, to lie down in a bed of &s;ecurity, in long oblivion of our woes! how &s;oothing is the &s;entiment, how full of con&s;olation! The ocean may roll its waves, the warring winds may join their forces, the thunders may &s;hake the &s;kies, the lightnings pa&s;s &s;wiftly from cloud to cloud; but not the force of winds combined, nor the &s;ound of thunder, nor the rage of many &s;eas though united in one peal, and directed to one point, can &s;hake the firm &s;ecurity of the tomb! The dead hear nothing of the tu|mult; conducted to &s;ilent man&s;ions, they cannot be awak|ened by the fierce&s;t thunders or the loude&s;t clamours. The unfortunate, the oppre&s;&s;ed and broken hearted, re&s;t here together, every &s;orrow is hu&s;hed and every pang ex|tingui&s;hed. Hence in all nations, a &s;et of names have a|ri&s;en to convey the idea of death congenial with the&s;e &s;entiments. It is called the harbour of re&s;t, where the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mariner wearied out by winds and &s;torms, at length moors his &s;hattered ve&s;&s;el, never more to return to the to&s;&s;ing of the wa&s;teful ocean. It is called the land of peace, where the friendle&s;s exile retire beyond the reach of malice and envy, and the cruele&s;t arrows of misfortune. It is called the ho&s;pitable hou&s;e, where the weatherbeaten traveller, &s;aint with traverling pathle&s;&s; defarts, finds a welcome and &s;ecure repo&s;e. But this brings me to the third thing propo&s;ed, which was to con&s;ider the grave as a place where the di&s;tinctions of life are leveled, where &s;ociety returns to it&s; fir&s;t principle&s;, where nature re&s;umes her rights and where all men are replaced in their original equality.</P>
<P>NEXT to the influence of our pa&s;&s;ions, the mo&s;t of the calamities which man inflicts on man, ari&s;e from the une|qual though nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tribution of property and power. Dazzled with riches and di&s;tinctions, we are apt to con&s;ider our&s;elves when we obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, not as men appointed to collect and pre&s;ide over the common &s;tores of provi|dence, but as undoubted heirs of exclu&s;ive advantages and
<PB N="8" REF="035491_0009_1004DEBB6322DF80">
&s;uperior in the very nature of things to the common ma&s;s of mankind. Than this, there cannot be an error more fatal either in theory or in life. This va&s;t globe on which we stand, is inhabited by millions of rational crea|tures, who have all an equal right to her productions; but as it is impo&s;&s;ible that we can all po&s;&s;e&s;s and as a greater &s;um total of happine&s;s re&s;ults from the pre&s;ent arrange|ments, it hath plea&s;ed the policy of providence to put this earth, with her inhabitants and productions, under the government of a few, who manage, under God, for the greater good of the whole. This is the original of all property and power, and the final ends which providence propo&s;es to accompli&s;h from the pre&s;ent inequality which prevails in life, and con&s;idered in this view, the policy is benevolent as well as profound. The di&s;tinction of ranks, the &s;ubordination among men, and the reverence for pow|er, when confined within their proper limits, and the ends of their in&s;titution, kept in view, are all nece&s;&s;ary in our &s;y&s;tem; but the amazement of a contemplative man proceeds from this, that the&s;e lords of the earth, who know them&s;elves to be but men, and who&s;e hearts are con&s;equently in the &s;ecret, &s;hould from this circurm&s;tance, take occa&s;ion to become tyrannical; that forgeting the ends of their preeminence, they &s;hould mi&s;take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for right, and act as if this world with its inhabitants, and productions, were created for their private advantage; that mi&s;taking property for power, they &s;hould erect them|&s;elves into ta&s;k-ma&s;ters, and make imperious war upon the freedom of the &s;pecies.&mdash;The advantages of &s;ociety, though numerous, make perhaps, but poor amends, when her principles are thus corrupted, when the &s;elfi&s;h &amp; tyrannical di&s;po&s;itions, find them&s;elves protected by power, and when the original equality of men is forgotten and di&s;claimed. Hence that in&s;olence of office, the &s;en&s;le&s;s va|nity of birth, the mean language of flattery, and the groans of the oppre&s;&s;ed, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound from all quarters of the earth&punc; Let none imagine that I mean to confine this abu&s;e to that cla&s;s of men whom we call the great; it is the con&s;equence of power of every &s;ize, be it great or &s;mall, in high life or in low. It is a general but morti|fying remark, that no man or &s;et of men, were ever yet endowed with unlimited privileges, which they did not wanton with, or abu&s;e. This is a general remark upon the human character. Today we &s;uffer, tomorrow we
<PB N="9" REF="035491_0010_1004DEBF279A7168">
oppre&s;s. Vain man, how &s;oon, and by what &s;light acci|dents, is his rea&s;on overturned. He fir&s;t by many a wea|ry &s;tep, and by many an anxious prayer to heaven for &s;ucce&s;s, pur&s;ues &s;ome favorite &s;cheme of happine&s;s. What vows does he nor make, that if heaven will but favor his undertakings, he will &s;till retain a grateful remembrance of the benefit; but he has no &s;ooner obtained the ends of his pre-eminence, than forgetting all his prayers and vows of gratitude, he pre&s;umptuou&s;ly a&s;cribes the whole to his own merit; boldly arrogates the partial indulgence of heaven to him&s;elf, as his right, and proceeding from one &s;tep of pride, oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;olly, to another; he &s;hakes alo&s;t the rod of power, makes him&s;elf a god in his own imagination, and forgets that men are his fellow|creatures.</P>
<P>FROM a review of the mi&s;eries of human life, as well tho&s;e which are the con&s;equences of power among man|kind, as tho&s;e which are unavoidable, men of warm fan|cies, and generous di&s;po&s;itions, have been led to imagine, that human affairs were not always in this &s;ituation. They have imagined, that a &s;cene &s;uch as the pre&s;ent exhibits, could not come originally from the hands of an all benevolent God. They have imagined a golden age wherein men lived as they came from the hands of their Creator, free, fearle&s;s, innocent, virtuous &amp; independent.</P>
<P>THEN &s;ay they, were there no wars to de&s;olate the world, no frauds put in practice among brethren. The &s;eeds of animo&s;ity were not yet &s;own, nor was the &s;oil prepared to receive them. No deceit lurked in the heart, no cloud darkened the brow; but man met man with erect countenances, the con&s;equences of freedom, of mutual confidence and independency; nor had luxury as yet invented her fatal arts, to enervate the mind or rack the body with acute di&s;ea&s;es Men lived &s;imply, recli|ned at their ea&s;e, beneath &s;hady trees, or by the &s;ides of brooks or &s;treams the fir&s;t inhabitants of the earth led lives devoted to love, to joy, and to innocency. And as all the pa&s;&s;ions were atuned to harmony within, the el|ements without, were in perfect concord, with the&s;e de|lightful movements. No cloud had as yet deformed the face of heaven; no &s;torm had collected over the affright|ed mariner, no thunders had been heard to roll, the &s;un
<PB N="10" REF="035491_0011_1004DEC0AC51DEF8">
&s;trone &s;erenelv, the gales blew &s;oftly, the face of the deep was calm; there was an eternal &s;pring, every heart beat with joy, and all nature was filled with hippine&s;s. Such they imagined, was the felicity of the fir&s;t &s;et of men.</P>
<P>BUT whil&s;t we &s;oothe our&s;elve&s; by looking back to a happine&s;s, which (if ever it exi&s;ted) is now no more; it will afford us a higher con&s;olation, to look forward to a &s;tate which really lies before us. Before us lies a peace|ful empire, where all the mi&s;eries of life are bu&s;hed, and where all the cau&s;es which agitate this upper world are de&s;troyed. In the grave all the di&s;tinctions of life cea&s;e; nature re&s;umes her rights, and all things are brought back once more, to their original level. The&s;e the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, there the weary re&s;t from their toils. There no pa&s;&s;ions di&s;tract, and no enemies de|&s;ame, their agonizing pain, and wounding in&s;amy and ruthle&s;s revenge are no more; but profound peace and calm pa&s;&s;ions and &s;ecurity, which is immoveable.</P>
<P>THUS, My Brethren, I have exhibited to your view, one of the most intere&s;ting &s;ubjects which can occupy the mind of man. In whatever light we view this awful &s;ubject, it pre&s;ents us with a &s;olemn &s;cene.</P>
<P>WHOEVER left the precincts of mortality without ca&s;t|ing a wi&s;hful look on what he had left behind, and a trembling eye on the, dreadful &s;cene before him? How affecting mu&s;t it be to dis&s;&s;olve at once, all the connections of life, and to part with all that is dear below the &s;un? How mortifying to think of that fair form, and the&s;e ac|tive limbs, in which we perhaps, too much boa&s;ted, be|coming pale and gha&s;tly, and &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffening like the clay, and ready to moulder into du&s;t; but how much more dread|ful &s;till is it, for a foul rouled to a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, during every moment of its pa&s;t exi&s;tence, to bur&s;t into the regions of eternity, there to appear before an awful judge, and to receive &s;entence according to the deeds done in the body; a &s;entence in exact proportion to the degrees of its guilt.</P>
<P>I COME now to the fourth thing propo&s;ed, which was, to draw &s;ome u&s;eful reflections from what has been &s;aid. And,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="11" REF="035491_0012_1004DEC31007F548">I. You who are &s;inking under the burden of &s;uf|fering and oppre&s;&s;ion be comforted: the day of your deliverance draweth nigh; the morning of your &s;alvation which you are &s;o ardently &s;oliciting. There is only one thing that can di&s;appoint your hopes, and that is, vice and irreligion; a glorious redemption awaits you be|yond the grave; render not your&s;elves unworthy of it All your afflictions and fiery trials which are but for a moment, will work out for you an high degree of felici|ty through all the ages of eternity.</P>
<P>AGAIN, you who enjoy the &s;un&s;hine of pro&s;perity, he not intoxicated; vain is that pre-eminence on which your &s;tate is founded; time is fa&s;t carrying you to the end of your enjoyments, and nothing can avail you but religion and virtue. In your life, your health, your comforts, your connections, the principles of de&s;truction work; you are &s;tanding upon a precipice, and the ground is fa&s;t &s;lipping from beneath your feet; your own life is al&s;o fleeting and tran&s;itory; every thought, every word, every action of your lives, is attended with eternal con&s;e|quences; it is either filling up the mea&s;ure of your happi|ne&s;s or mi&s;ery; do not then &s;uffer the &s;hadowy &s;eene here below, to rob you of your &s;upreme felicity.</P>
<P>AGAIN, thirdly, Let us learn from the whole of what has been &s;aid, not to value our&s;elves by our &s;ituations in life. The&s;e &s;ituations; are nece&s;&s;ary; and it is nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome &s;hould fill them. It would &s;eem that God hath varied our circum&s;tances, that we might have an oppor|tunity of acting a part in different &s;ituations; to be flav|i&s;h in adver&s;ity is improper, to be in&s;olent in pro&s;peri|ty is ridiculous. The only thing that we ought to be &s;olicitous about, is our conduct.

<P>ACCORDING to the words of an excellent poet,</P>

It is hope whch make us face difficulties, wre&s;tle with mi&s;fortunes, and ri&s;e unconquered from calamities, which would otherwi&s;e cru&s;h us to the du&s;t, and make us cry out in the de&s;pair of our hearts, it is better for us to die than to live. The &s;ame principle which accompanies us in every di&s;tre&s;sful &s;cene of life, and even prevents us from throwing away life it&s;elf, as an intolerable burden, carries our views into a future &s;tate, and di&s;po&s;es us irre|&s;i&s;tably to look for that happine&s;s there, which we have labored after here in vain.</P>
<P>THE happine&s;s which we pur&s;ue in this &s;tate, is deceit|ful and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gacious, it glitters before us like a fal&s;e fire, which embarra&s;&s;es the benighted traveller. In vain we double our &s;peed and reach after what is not. The vain delu&s;ion &s;till mocks our toil, and eludes our gra&s;p. At length having &s;uffciently &s;ported with our credulity, it vani&s;hes at once, and leaves us a prey to perplexity and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>NOT &s;o the happine&s;&s; of a future &s;tate. Like a light hung out on &s;tormy coa&s;t, to direct the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mari|ner, we &s;teer to it thro' millions of &s;urrounding waves. In vain the tempe&s;t be&s;ets us, and night falls with all its &s;hades, we keep it &s;teady in our eye through the gloom, and braves the oppo&s;ition of the elements; &s;ecure that if we can but reach the de&s;ired haven, we &s;hall find a &s;helter from the &s;torm, and an agreeable and &s;afe retreat from the perils of a di&s;a&s;trous voyage. This is the point, my brethren, which we ought to have always in our eye. This will keep us &s;teady and uniform, amid&s;t all the fluc|tuations of this pre&s;ent life; and it will at length land us in that happy country, where harmony, love and joy &s;hall ever reign.</P>
<P>To encourage you &s;till farther to per&s;evere in one u|niform cour&s;e of religion and virtue, I &s;hall exhibit to your view, &s;ome features of the leading characters of your nation.</P>
<P>AND the fir&s;t con&s;picuous character which I ought to mention, is one who &s;tands high on the records of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame, and I am per&s;uaded high al&s;o, in the affections and e&s;|teem of every good man. Like an healthy plant, be&s;ide &s;ome nutritious &s;tream, he grew up &s;ilently, and perhaps
<PB N="13" REF="035491_0014_1004DECB05FFCFF8">
imperceived by the vulgar eye. However unob&s;erved by others, he was fat and full of &s;ap; the rough winds of adver&s;ity only made him &s;trike the deeper root; and al|though the winters bla&s;ts often withered his leaves, yet the general &s;pring made him &s;well and ri&s;e. From &s;torms he was a &s;helter, and from heat a &s;hade. To the birds of the air he afforded a &s;ecure and &s;afe retreat; and every living thing rejoiced under his protection. The little hills rejoiced on every &s;ide, and the mountains were refre&s;hed with his &s;hade. The Lion and the Wolf, &s;oothed with his fragrance, laid a&s;ide their fiercene&s;s. Under his chequered &s;hade, herbs, trees, plants, fruits, and flowers with plea&s;ant &s;miles, reared their joyful heads. His head towered to the &s;kies, and his leaves &s;ip|ped the &s;ilver dews.</P>

<P>THIS is the man, Gentlemen, who was at the helm of your affairs; who &s;teadily conducted the ve&s;&s;el of &s;tate amid&s;t the &s;torms and tempe&s;ts of tedious war. Although &s;he was much to&s;&s;ed on the &s;urface of the wa&s;teful ocean, yet by his care and diligence, &s;he was at length conducted into a &s;afe harbour. That re&s;t, which (through the pro|vidence of God) you now enjoy, is in a great mea&s;ure owing to his &s;trenuous efforts. He was your Jo&s;hua, who, although Jordan was overflowing his banks, open|ed up a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age for your people. Tell me, you who know, whither his prudence, his fortitude, his ju&s;tice, or his temperance, were the mo&s;t con&s;picuous features of his character? Whil&s;t the&s;e virtues &s;hone in his life and conver&s;ation, they were con&s;tantly brightened by a graceful piety and an ardent devotion.</P>
<P>SHALL I mention in the &s;econd place, or &s;hall I com|pare, or rather equal with him, the great man, on whom you have now conferred the mo&s;t burden &s;ome toils, and the highe&s;t office of &s;tate. Like him, he has grown old among&s;t you, and has exerted all his powers in hi&s; coun|tries &s;ervice.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="035491_0015_1004DECDB436F950">WHILST the one was &s;teering the ve&s;&s;el of &s;tate, the other was &s;haping her cour&s;e; whil&s;t the one brought liberty to your country, the other was providing a &s;afe reception for her continuance. The one was the mo&s;t active hand for pre&s;erving your country from a foreign inva&s;ion, the other has pre&s;erved her from a diabolical &s;cheme of foreign intrigue. The one was a ble&s;&s;ing to you in time of war; the other is a ble&s;&s;ing in time of peace. The one has now laid a&s;ide the burden of pub|lic toil; and is enjoying a calm, a delicious &amp; &s;afe retreat; the other is &s;till &s;tooping under the cares of an exten&s;ive government. In both, prudence, ju&s;tice, temperance, and fortitude, &s;eem to reign. Your time would &s;ail me but to mention mauy others, who are highly de&s;erving of the gratitude of their country. May their deathle&s;s names &s;till live in the hearts and lives of their children, their friends, and in the hearts of the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>THERE is only one character which I &s;hall beg leave to mention; and that is of one who has been gradually drawn into my view, by the excellent &s;entiments which flow in his &s;peeches and proclamations, by the glowing warmth of affection, expre&s;&s;ed by his friends and con&s;ti|tuents, and the high encomiums of tho&s;e who differ from him in political &s;entiments. The&s;e rays increa&s;ed and brightened the nearer I approached the luminous ob|ject. "Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord thy God, who delighteth in thee, to &s;et thee as the head of this people, becau&s;e the Lord hath not ca&s;t off this people, therefore made he thee ruler, to do ju&s;tice and judgment."</P>
<P>I WILL not life flattering titles&mdash;No. Native excel|lency needs not the foreign aid of ornament, but is when unadorned, adorned the mo&s;t. One of the highe&s;t hu|man characters given in the &s;criptures, is comprehended in three words: "Enoch walked with God." Your &s;tation, your character, your per&s;on, your abilities, call loudly for the highe&s;t gratitude and prai&s;e to heaven. You live in the hearts of all tho&s;e who know you; culti|vate true religion und you &s;hall live al&s;o in the hearts of 1a|te&s;t po&s;terity, and &s;hine as the &s;un in the kingdom of your father; many children will be born unto God by your influence, and will &s;hine as &s;tars to adorn you in the re|gions above.</P>

<P><HI>To the Hon Lieutenant Governor, and Council, and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</HI></P>
<P>I WOULD al&s;o beg leave to pre&s;ent re&s;pectful addre&s;&s;|es and congratulations, on this plea&s;ing occa&s;ion. In proportion to your elevation, you are drawing the eyes of the world upon you. What might have pa&s;&s;ed unob|&s;erved in a private &s;itua&s;ion, will be deeply &s;crutinized in you, who are called to act in a public capacity. Con|&s;ider that the intere&s;ts of the &s;tate, their virtues, and their vices, will be very much influenced by your actions and behaviour. Nay, your influence will perhaps flow to la|te&s;t po&s;terity. The enemies of your government, your religion, and your happine&s;s, have been of late increa&s;ing in all countries. In &s;chools, in colleges, and in &s;emina|ries of learning, they have been endeavouring to in&s;inu|ate them&s;elves and to &s;ubvert every &s;teady principle of human life. Would you wi&s;h them to in&s;pire life and vigor into your infant &s;tate; would you wi&s;h her to be rendered a ble&s;&s;ing in the mid&s;t of the earth; begin then in your &s;everal departments, to cultivate true religion. Let it not be the vain rant of enthu&s;ia&s;ts or the ma&s;k of hypocrites to deceive and betray. No. Let it be that &s;teady ma&s;culine piety, which actuates the whole foul, and &s;hines out iu the life and conver&s;ation. Let your families, your connections, your con&s;tituents, all bear wit|ne&s;s to your devotion, your ju&s;tice, your charity, your humility, your candor and truth. Tru&s;ting in God a|lone, and in Je&s;us Chri&s;t the &s;urety of lo&s;t man, &s;teady to abound in every chri&s;tian grace and virtue. This is the life of the &s;oul, this is the life of &s;ociety, and this will &s;ave your country from ruin.</P>
<P>I SHALL now conclude this di&s;cour&s;e, with AN ADDRESS TO THS WHOLE BODY OF THE PEOPLE.</P>
<P>MY BRETHREN,</P>
<P>You pro&s;e&s;s your&s;elves to be the &s;ource of power: that all power is derived from the tree and voluntary &s;uffrages of the people. See then that this fountain be pure; otherwi&s;e, all the &s;treams which i&s;&s;ue from it will be fainted with the corruptions which i&s;&s;ue from the &s;ource. If I were an enemy to your government and
<PB N="16" REF="035491_0017_1004DED301D6A460">
to your felicity, I would encourage you in keeping reli|gion from your hou&s;es, from your &s;chools, and from your churches; I would advi&s;e &s;peculators to &s;trike in with the leading vices of the youth, and &s;how them how they may act the madman more genteelly. I would en|courage youth to de&s;pi&s;e the&s;e unwildly and clum&s;y crea|tures, whom they call Prie&s;ts, as only an interruption and hindrance in the plea&s;ures of life. I would advi&s;e them to reject with di&s;dain, the &s;ordid par&s;imeny of their parents, as unbecoming their rank and &s;tation. I would encourage them to turn their minds to external pomp and &s;how, and glitter in the fir&s;t ranks of &s;ocieiy. I would advi&s;e them to &s;train every nerve to out&s;hine their companions, though at the expence of their parents, their friends, their hone&s;ty, their veracity, and every thing virtuous and &s;acred. I would &s;ay, rejoice, O young man in thy youth; let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth; walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the &s;ight of thine eyes; eat, drink, and be merry. I would ad|vi&s;e the leaders of the people to &s;tep before them into the &s;cenes of vice, where they may throw away their virtue, their religion, and their fortune at once. But what &s;ays the wisdom of Solomon? "Know thou, that for all the&s;e things, God will bring thee into judgment." There thou mu&s;t give an account of the deeds done in the body, whither they be good or bad.</P>
<P>GOD, My Brethren, has given you a large and &s;pa|cious country; a country of mountains and vallies, of hills and dales, of rivers, woods, and plains; a country loudly calling for the indu&s;try of the hu&s;bandman; a country teeming with natural wealth, producing in a|bundance, all the &s;imple nece&s;&s;aries of life; a country where the pious man may wor&s;hip God without fear, and fea&s;t abundantly upon the fruits of his indu&s;try. What temptation then can there be to tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds of virtue? What need of &s;peculation, of cheating, of deceit, and accumulating wealth upon the ruin of our fellow|creatures? In proportion to the&s;e high natural advent|ges which you enjoy, &s;uch is the aggravation of all the&s;e crimes which prevail among you. I could ea&s;ily trace the&s;e crimes to their &s;ource, and &s;hew you how the mind is warped by early habit, by the deceit which appears in the lives of parents, and the&s;e with whom we are ac|quainted
<PB N="17" REF="035491_0018_1004DED6C7E685A0">
in our infancy; from the too ardent de&s;ire of pomp and &s;how, and from the overflowings of vice in o|ther, countries finding a re&s;ervoir in this.</P>
<P>BUT I have no plea&s;ure in wounding your feelings. I &s;hall leave the&s;e topics to your own meditation, and ex|hort you to lay a&s;ide all guile, all hypocri&s;y, and evil &s;peaking, and as new born babes to de&s;ire the &s;incere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby.</P>
<P>WOULD you, My Brethren, trace all the&s;e &s;treams of vice to their &s;ources, and &s;incerely repent of your &s;ins; would you adopt the re&s;olution of Zaccheus, the publi|can, "Shew mercy to the poor, and if you have taken any thing from any man by fal&s;e acculation, re&s;tore it to him four fold," you would be the happie&s;t people upon earth. But do not think that you can become religious whil&s;t you retain the gains of di&s;hone&s;ty. No: Do not deceive your your&s;elves; &s;ooner can the rivers and &s;treams rea&s;cend the lofty mountains, &s;ooner can the E|theopian change his &s;kin, or the Leopard his &s;pots, than you can enjoy true communion with God, whil&s;t you pol|lute your hands, by holding of bribes. "Clean&s;e your hands, ye &s;inners, and purify your hearts ye double mind|ed; then draw high unto God and he will draw high unto you." Let that grace and truth which &s;hone in your Saviour, as its native &s;ource, al&s;o adorn your characters. Thus your affections will be expanded, and will diffu&s;e them&s;elves without re&s;traint, upon all around you. That mutual tru&s;t, which is the ba&s;is of all other &s;ocial enjoyments, will be more and more &s;trengthened. You will become a ble&s;&s;ing to your&s;elves, a ble&s;&s;ing to your parents, a ble&s;&s;ing to your children, a ble&s;&s;ing to your &s;tate, a ble&s;&s;ing to your country. You will be ble&s;&s;ed in your ba&s;ket, ble&s;&s;ed in your &s;tore, ble&s;&s;ed in your life, ble&s;&s;ed in your death, and ble&s;&s;ed through all the ages of eternity.</P>
<P>As I am a &s;tranger, and without political views or in|tere&s;t at &s;take, I hope you will li&s;ten to me with an un|prejudiced ear.</P>
<P>FLY from all enthu&s;ia&s;tic rants, and freaks of enthu&s;i|a&s;m; let your manners be &s;imple and plain; let &s;inceri|ty and truth &s;hine more in your actions than in your
<PB N="18" REF="035491_0019_1004DED84E1D8E50">
words; let the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind, the orphan and the fatherle&s;s, feel that you are Chri&s;t's Repre&s;entatives upon earth. Religion does not con&s;i&s;t in "bowing down the head as a bulru&s;h, and &s;preading &s;ackcloth and a&s;hes order us." No, it con&s;i&s;ts in "loo&s;ing the bands of wickedne&s;s, in undoing the heavy burdens, in letting the oppr&s;&s;ed go free, and in breaking every yoke. It is to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor who are ca&s;t out to thy hou&s;e; when thou &s;ee&s;t the naked, that thou cover them, and that thou hide not thy &s;elf from &s;hine own fle&s;h. If the&s;e actions flow from true chri&s;tian prince|ples "then &s;hall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health &s;hall &s;pring forth &s;peedily; and thy righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall go before thee; the glory of the Lord &s;hall be thy rearward." Do not, my Brethren, think that by the&s;e exhortations I de&s;pi&s;e the doctrines of grace, no, God forbid; but I would not carry that doctrine a|bove what is written; the grace of God is as necce&s;&s;ary as the warming &s;un, and the genial influences of &s;pring are to the &s;welling year; but remember that it acts as imperceptibly, as the&s;e latent influences.</P>
<P>THESE loo&s;e thoughts I have thrown together pray|ing that the God of heaven may render them effectual in producing &s;ome uniformity in religious opinions.</P>
<P>I SHALL now conclude the whole of this tedious di&s;|cour&s;e, with entreating you to give a vigorous &s;upport to Mini&s;ters, Magi&s;trates, and Rulers, E&s;tabli&s;h them on &s;uch a permanent ba&s;is, as to render their &s;everal depart|ments re&s;pectable, and objects for the highe&s;t abilities to enter into them. Thus Church and &s;tate, will go hand in hand in pouring felicity upon the whole body of the people.</P>
