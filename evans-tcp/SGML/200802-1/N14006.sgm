<P>THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE Confederate States of North America TO PRAISE GOD. TWO SERMONS. Preached at PEQUEA, December 13th, 1781, the day recommended by the honourable Congre&s;s to the &s;everal States, to be ob&s;erved as a DAY OF THANKSGIVING TO GOD, for the various inter|po&s;itions of his providence in their favour, during their conte&s;t with Great Britain, particularly tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent year, crowned by the capture of Lord Cornwallis with his whole army.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>To the Reader.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE author &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the dre&s;s in which the&s;e &s;ermons appear, or of the method of hand|ling the &s;ubject, only that they are &s;uch as he judgeth to be mo&s;t conducive to the benefit of his readers in common. Gentlemen of ob&s;ervation and &s;tudies can &s;elect arguments from the public prints, from di&s;&s;erta|tions, or general harangues: But the bulk of mankind need to have the&s;e &s;elected for them, ranged in &s;ome order, and particularly illu&s;trated and enforced. He is &s;en&s;ible that &s;everal of his arguments are very com|mon, having been frequently treated by the politicians of the day, and treated to great advantage; which, in &s;ome re&s;pects, is no very favourable circum&s;tance for him as an author, e&s;pecially as the ta&s;te of the times is chiefly for &s;omething new, and but little for piety. However, the religious ca&s;t he has attempted to give them, and the illu&s;trations from &s;cripture, by which they are enforced, are, in a great mea&s;ure, new. For the&s;e rea&s;ons he expects they will be the more reli&s;h|ing to &s;erious minds, that wi&s;h to &s;ee them more fully turned into a religious channel; and, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, may be the means of leading &s;ome others to think more &s;eriou&s;ly upon tho&s;e intere&s;ting &s;ubjects. The&s;e are his hopes, and his principal motives for this publication. It is certainly high time for us to awake out of &s;leep, and pay a mo&s;t pious attention to the very great and intere&s;ting events of our day. That this e&s;&s;ay may be ble&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e ends, is the hearty de&s;ire of a well-wi&s;her to his country, and a &s;ervant of the church for Chri&s;t's &s;ake.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>"PRAISE Ye the Lord: for it is good to &s;ing prai&s;es to our God: for it is plea&s;ant, and prai&s;e is come|ly." It is comely: for of all the exerci&s;es upon earth it bears the neare&s;t re&s;emblance to the wor&s;hip of heaven, and highly becometh us as rea&s;onable creatures, but much more as chri&s;tians. Our obligations to the duty are founded as well on our own indigence, as on the glory of Jehovah, and his goodne&s;s to us. Every one daily receiveth innumerable mercies from his unwa&s;ted fullne&s;s, which daily lay him under fre&s;h obligations to prai&s;e the bountiful author of them. Communities, as collective bodies, are bound to prai&s;e him no le&s;s than individuals. By the common laws of &s;ociety, the good of the whole and of individuals mutually affect each other, which obligeth them to offer prai&s;e re&s;pectively, not only from &s;elf-intere&s;t, but from the purer &s;prings of be|nevolence. This more evidently appears in &s;ome public &s;cenes of providence, which are &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, that he who runneth may read the peculiar favours of heaven to the whole and to the individuals: then more e&s;pecially let all the people prai&s;e God. And as all the people are bound to prai&s;e God on &s;uch occa&s;ions; &s;o it is mo&s;t harmonious, animating and many ways u&s;eful for the whole to unite in his prai&s;es at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>This day, my brethren, we and all the inhabitants of the United States are called to give thanks to the LORD of lords and KING of kings, for the many peculiar favours he hath of late vouch&s;afed to us, as a people appearing in defence of our invaluable privileges. At this important
<PB N="2" REF="017722_0004_0FA2629F80807AA0">
call let every individual, let every family, let every con|gregation, let every town, let every &s;tate, let all our con|federate &s;tates unite in prai&s;ing our God, as with one heart and one voice.</P>
<P>To this noble exerci&s;e the royal p&s;almi&s;t mo&s;t pathetic|ally exciteth us in the p&s;alm where my text lies, which is mo&s;t happily adapted to, and compo&s;ed for, a day of public thank&s;giving. It was &s;ung by the Jews, and with greater propriety may be &s;ung by Chri&s;tians, on &s;uch occa&s;ions; for to us it had an ultimate reference, and the moral rea|&s;ons of the &s;ong &s;hine with brighter evidence in the new te&s;tament di&s;pen&s;ation than in the old.</P>
<P>The motives to prai&s;e expre&s;&s;ed in the p&s;alm, are, <Q>God's &s;aving health,</Q> or &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, to be made known to all nations; and his moral government of the world, who &s;hall <Q>judge the people righteou&s;ly, and govern the nations upon earth.</Q> It is this la&s;t motive I &s;hall chiefly in&s;i&s;t upon.</P>
<P>The importance of the duty, and zeal with which it &s;hould be performed, we learn fir&s;t from the rhetorical and affecting repetition in the text of the very words expre&s;&s;ed in the third ver&s;e, in which the mind of the p&s;almi&s;t ap|pears to have been wrapt in his &s;ubject, like one mo&s;t in|tent upon, and earne&s;t in the pur&s;uit of his object. Se|condly, from the beautiful and tran&s;porting climax by which the &s;ong a&s;cends: <Q>Let the people prai&s;e thee, O God! let ALL the people prai&s;e thee.</Q></P>
<P>To comply with the de&s;ign of my text and of this day, I &s;hall point out and illu&s;trate &s;ome of the leading obligations upon all the inhabitants of the confederate &s;tates of North America to unite in prai&s;e to God, for the &s;ignal interpo&s;i|tions of his providence in their favour, during our conte&s;t with Great Britain; e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the la&s;t campaign, crowned by the capture of lord Cornwallis with his whole army.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e obligations ari&s;e from the nature and importance of the cau&s;e conte&s;ted&mdash;the fatal con&s;equences to us and to our po&s;terity had we lo&s;t the cau&s;e&mdash;the &s;trong and nu|merous ob&s;tacles that &s;tood in our way&mdash;our apparent in|ability
<PB N="3" REF="017722_0004_0FA2629F80807AA0">
for the mighty conflict&mdash;&s;ome noticeable &s;teps of providence towards us in giving us a few, though they might &s;eem to be inadequate, preparatives for the war. The various and remarkable &s;ucce&s;&s;es God hath granted to our troops e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the la&s;t campaign&mdash;&s;everal inci|dents inter&s;per&s;ed through the &s;cene, which were overruled by a wi&s;e and good providence in our favour, though at fir&s;t &s;undry of them might &s;eem to &s;tand much again&s;t us&mdash; and from the glorious pro&s;pects to us and to our po&s;terity, opened by the &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;es of our arms, and the man|ner in which they have been granted.</P>
<P N="1">I. The nature and importance of the cau&s;e conte&s;ted lay us under the &s;tronge&s;t obligations to prai&s;e God for pleading our cau&s;e. The great object in conte&s;t is, whe|ther our e&s;&s;ential and unalienable rights and privileges, as well civil as &s;acred, &s;hall be in our own power, or at the &s;overeign will of tyrants. Take the&s;e from the peo|ple, and commit them to any ab&s;olute lord, or lords, and no man has a &s;ecurity for the rights of con&s;cience, for life, or for property and the means of procuring it.</P>
<P>It has long been the boa&s;t of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, that it &s;ecures tho&s;e privileges to the &s;ubjects, becau&s;e it is founded upon the two grand pillars of liberty, a right to di&s;po&s;e of our own property, and a right to have our claim to life and property tried by a jury of fellow citi|tizens. But the&s;e rights the Briti&s;h court and parliament have by every artifice endeavoured to undermine, at|tempting to lead us to own either directly or indirectly, the ju&s;tne&s;s of their claim of right to tax us at plea&s;ure, to oblige &s;ome of our citizens to take their trial in Britain, and to alter and virtually de&s;troy our forms of civil go+vernment. They long &s;hrouded their real de&s;ign by &s;pe|cious pretexts; but their artifice failing them, they own the extent of their claim, viz. an omnipotent power to make laws "to bind us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever." And in order to confi&s;cate all the &s;tates to the crown, they de|clare us to be in a &s;tate of rebellion, and ari&s;e to execute their horrid plot by open violence, not doubting that they would make an ea&s;y conque&s;t of us.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="017722_0005_0FA262A214F29C20">To ju&s;tify their violent mea&s;ures, they employ their whole policy to confound law and con&s;titution, and make the world believe, that our oppo&s;ition to their iniquitous uncon&s;titutional acts was an oppo&s;ition to the con&s;titution it&s;elf, and a ri&s;ing again&s;t lawful authority. This is the idea of our conduct held up by them to their own nation, and to all Europe, to excite their dete&s;tation at us, as a rebellious and lawle&s;s mob. And with this lie they fill the mouths of their ignorant officers and &s;oldiers, and in&s;pire their brea&s;ts, as well with violence as with thir&s;t for plun|der and blood.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more cruel or more fal&s;e! America betook her&s;elf to arms in oppo&s;ition to the mo&s;t unlawful exerci&s;e of power, and in defence of privileges which the unalienable rights of mankind ab&s;olutely forbid her to yield! And this &s;he did not, till &s;he had tried every other means in vain, and till Britain had wantonly &s;hed the blood of her &s;ons! In tho&s;e circum&s;tances it was not only our in|di&s;pen&s;ible duty to oppo&s;e force to force; but it was the duty of all Britain to re&s;ent &s;o violent an infraction upon their own con&s;titution; for they might expect the next &s;troke to fall upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But the glorious Sovereign of the earth and heavens hath lifted up a banner for you, O ye highly favoured Americans! and hath &s;aved you by his right hand. He hath rai&s;ed up many friends for you, &s;ent you many aids, and made you to be pitied by many nations! He hath &s;cat|tered your clouds, &s;ilenced your fears, encouraged your hopes, defended your per&s;ons and property, and he will defend them, if ye wi&s;ely improve the ble&s;&s;ings of his merciful providence! Ye &s;hall wor&s;hip your God, and none &s;hall make you afraid! Ye &s;hall enjoy your po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions undi&s;turbed, for which ye have laboured and &s;weat, and for which many of your brave&s;t &s;ons have ri&s;qued their lives in the high places of the field, and many of them have &s;pilt their deare&s;t blood! Grim tyranny hangs his head! Fair liberty hath erected her banner! Therefore ye &s;hall &s;it &s;ecure under the protection of laws founded upon this firm ba&s;is! Nor may the ble&s;&s;ings of your vir|tuous
<PB N="5" REF="017722_0005_0FA262A214F29C20">
&s;truggles be confined to your&s;elves; other nations beholding them may open their eyes upon their own duty and privilege. Your liberty &s;ecured, like the &s;un bur&s;t|ing through the cloud, may &s;hed its healing beams over the nations long &s;hut up in darkne&s;s and bondage! For all the&s;e mercies let all our nation offer the acceptable &s;acri|fice of prai&s;e! And let the whole earth uniting in our &s;ong, prai&s;e him who judgeth the people righteou&s;ly, and governeth the nations upon earth!</P>
<P N="2">II. The fatal con&s;equences to us and our po&s;terity, had we lo&s;t the cau&s;e, furni&s;h a mo&s;t fruitful &s;ource of motives to prai&s;e our great deliverer. The greater the evils are from which a people are &s;aved, the greater are their obligations to their &s;aviour. But the evils which threatned us were many and mo&s;t grievous. No people upon earth are in a condition more wretched than we &s;hould have been reduced to, had the Briti&s;h arms prevailed. A government would have been e&s;tabli&s;hed over us, the form of which is no where exi&s;tent, and none &s;o de&s;tructive of the liberties of the people. Ari|&s;tocracy and ab&s;olute monarchy are u&s;ually e&s;teemed the two wor&s;t kinds of government. But the &s;tronge&s;t efforts were made to unite both virtually in the government to be fixed upon us; or rather it would have been an ari&s;tocra|cy &s;anctioned by monarchy, which is infinitely wor&s;e than pure ab&s;olute monarchy. If neither of the&s;e are its proper name, it is hard to &s;ay by what name it &s;hould be called.</P>
<P>So &s;trong was the Briti&s;h &s;overeign's, thir&s;t to e&s;tabli&s;h de&s;poti&s;m, that he created forty lords, from the beginning of his infamous reign to the commencement of the pre&s;ent war, who had not a claim to a foot of land in Britain; that being pen&s;ioners upon the crown, they might throw their weight into the &s;cale, to de&s;troy the liberties of the people. How many more he has created &s;ince that time I know not. How are the&s;e numerous unlanded lords to be &s;upported? principally, no doubt, from the &s;poils of North America. To this in&s;tance of his folly he adds another, viz. favouring a &s;cheme to render his parliament ab&s;olute. Folly I call it, as well as wickedne&s;s. For
<PB N="6" REF="017722_0006_0FA262A221809960">
tho&s;e petty tyrants might, by virtue of their authority, make the royal tyrant him&s;elf feel the weight of their pow|er, &s;hould he at any time happen not to coincide with their views. But he had no other way to e&s;tabli&s;h ty|ranny, and force from the people what&s;oever his covetous heart lu&s;ted for, but by allowing to them the enormous pow|er of making laws to bind the people in all ca&s;es what|&s;oever. And they, fond of &s;o great an extent of power, favour the king's ambitious and tyrannical views, which otherwi&s;e they might perhaps have oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch a government who could live? It would he hard to be &s;ubjected to the will of one tyrant&mdash;harder &s;till to be &s;ubject to more than 500 tyrants, all plotting with their cruel ma&s;ter to fleece and di&s;tre&s;s the &s;ubjects&mdash; But harde&s;t of all to be under the command of their viceroys, at the di&s;tance of 3000 miles from the &s;eat of authority, all governing according to the arbitrary orders of &s;o many un|merciful de&s;pots, and making &s;uch repre&s;entations to them, as their ambitious, covetous, or revengeful pa&s;&s;ions might dictate. Such motives and &s;uch opportunities for the exer|ci&s;e of tyranny could no where be found. Of this Ameri|ca has already had a ta&s;te in their introductory &s;teps to bring us under the yoke; and but a ta&s;te, compared with what &s;he would feel, when their villainous &s;cheme &s;hould have been completed.</P>
<P>Add to all this the tythes of your whole produce every year for the &s;upport of the church, and the rapacity and cruelty of the harpies, officers and others, to whom di&s;tricts of the country would be parcelled out, for their &s;ervices in reducing us to a &s;tate of bondage.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is no chimerical idea to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch appointments and &s;uch grants would be made to them. Whence is it that &s;o many parts of Germany, Britain and Ireland groan under the yoke of oppre&s;&s;ion, but from the dukedoms, counties, &amp;c. granted to the ance&s;tors of their petty tyrants, for their aid either in money or in the field. And it is more than a conjecture, that lands were promi&s;ed to the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers, and di&s;tricts of the country to their officers, as encouragements to them to en|gage in the &s;ervice.</NOTE> Who could bear the
<PB N="7" REF="017722_0006_0FA262A221809960">
in&s;olence and rapacity of a Cornwallis, a Knyphau&s;en, a Galloway, an Arnold, a Tarleton, or a Simcoe, either as a governor or a landlord?</P>
<P>Now, Americans, what would be your di&s;tre&s;&s;es, when, be&s;ides the &s;upport of governors and other nece&s;&s;ary ex|pences of government, you would be obliged to give the tenth of all your produce every year, for the &s;upport of the clergy, and tho&s;e too not of your own choo&s;ing;&mdash;to pay the whole demands of a greedy landlord, and the whole claim of a tyrannical prince, to aggrandi&s;e his numerous family, to maintain his pen&s;ioned lords, and to di&s;charge a debt of more than &s;eventy millions, contracted to en&s;lave you?</P>
<P>The&s;e things duly weighed, are &s;ufficient to &s;et &s;prings to the gratitude of all, for the pre&s;ervation of their liber|ties, and put a check to the murmurings of &s;ome, who ac|count it hard to give a moderate competency for the main|tainance of the few hone&s;t mini&s;ters among&s;t us, and di&s;|charge, for a time, the expences of a war &s;o ju&s;t and &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary. Had Britain made a conque&s;t of us, we and our po&s;terity would have multiplied taxes, of a much greater amount, to pay every year perpetually, with every circum|&s;tance of aggravation and bitterne&s;s. Every &s;pecies of cruelty has breathed from, and as far as was in their power, has been practi&s;ed by the tyrants and their tools, as a &s;pe|cimen of what America had to expect. They have hired and prompted their barbarous allies to &s;hed Chri&s;tian blood;&mdash;armed &s;laves again&s;t their ma&s;ters;&mdash;wantonly burned towns;&mdash;robbed, plundered and de&s;troyed private property;&mdash;and treated with the greate&s;t barbarity per&s;ons of every &s;ex and age. They may plead, as they have done, that the&s;e are ca&s;ualties incident to war. Some of them might be &s;o; but many, perhaps mo&s;t of them, were not &s;o. Soldiers dur&s;t not act &s;o barbarou&s;ly in common, did they not know it to be agreeable to their officers; nor officers, did they not know it to be agreeable to their cruel ma&s;ters. Every circum&s;tance in the conduct of the court and army clearly manife&s;ts, that their orders and de&s;ign were to proceed again&s;t us upon the plan of cruelty and ter|ror.
<PB N="8" REF="017722_0007_0FA262A2DBD42540">
And they have carried on the war with a barbarity unknown in Europe or any civili&s;ed nation.</P>
<P>The malice of the tyrants would have put an aggravation into all the other &s;ufferings of America, by robbing her of her mo&s;t precious jewels. The leading members of Con|gre&s;s, and others who have appeared mo&s;t eminent in the cau&s;e of their country, might have fallen the fir&s;t &s;acrifice to their wrath. Mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel of a patriotic &s;tamp would have &s;hared no mercy. Many indubitable te&s;timonies induce us to believe this.</P>
<P>But I do not think it is in the power of de&s;cription fully to paint all the &s;hocking con&s;equences to our country, had &s;he been &s;ubjugated to Briti&s;h tyranny. O! how great is our &s;alvation, and how great the prai&s;es due for it! Prai&s;e ye the Lord, all ye brave &s;tate&s;men, who dared to &s;tep forth in your country's cau&s;e. Prai&s;e him, every brave officer and &s;oldier, who dared to face the greate&s;t dangers in de|fence of your country. Prai&s;e him, every hone&s;t mini&s;ter of the &s;anctuary, who&s;e blood the enemy thir&s;ted for&punc; And ye hone&s;t hearted friends to your country, throughout all the &s;tates, prai&s;e ye the Lord; for he hath delivered you from your heavy chains. <Q>O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth forever. Let the redeemed of the Lord &s;ay &s;o, whom he hath re|deemed from the hand of the enemy.</Q></P>
<P N="3">III. The &s;trong and numerous ob&s;tacles which &s;tood in our way, demand our warme&s;t prai&s;es to HIM who enabled us to &s;urmount them all. We had the mo&s;t powerful na|tion upon earth to oppo&s;e, all things con&s;idered, and the mo&s;t dangerous. A nation who&s;e &s;overeign is de&s;potic, ob&s;tinate and cruel; their &s;tate&s;men &s;ubtile, treacherous, in&s;idious, &s;wollen with a &s;en&s;e of their own importance, and long practi&s;ed in the arts of government and deceit; their officers and troops generally e&s;teemed equal, if not &s;uperior, to any in Europe; their fleet the mo&s;t formidable of any in the world. With their &s;hips of war they &s;hut up our ports, covered their troops, and ea&s;ily tran&s;ported them from &s;tate to &s;tate. A nation who&s;e trea&s;ury was re&s;pectable, their credit great, and their re&s;ources from
<PB N="9" REF="017722_0007_0FA262A2DBD42540">
their numerous manufactures, their exten&s;ive trade, the fertility of their lands, and the riches of their &s;ettlements in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, were great and numerous! We had the flower of their army to oppo&s;e, with twen|ty thou&s;and foreign mercenaries, and a coa&s;t of many hun|dred miles to defend!</P>
<P>Our ancient forms of government, the prejudices of cu&s;tom, and our doating affection for Britain, were &s;trong bars in our way. The governors of the colonies were creatures of the crown, their connexions together with the Briti&s;h merchants upon the continent generally in the in|tere&s;t of the crown. To the&s;e I might add Tories and Refugees, a &s;ett of the mo&s;t infamous &s;ycophants, mur|derer, plunderers, robbers and lyars, that ever polluted any land; &s;undry of whom were per&s;ons of fortune, and &s;undry of them crafty, plau&s;ible, and intrigueing, having been long employed in &s;tate bu&s;ine&s;s. The&s;e all united their efforts and policy to di&s;tre&s;s, to intimidate, to &s;ow di&s;cord, to &s;pread fal&s;e reports, and to blind the eyes of the people. Sometimes they repre&s;ented the power of Britain to be &s;o great, that nothing could &s;tand before it; and therefore we would fall an ea&s;y prey to their arms, and none would have &s;ecurity for their per&s;ons or property, but tho&s;e who would take an active part again&s;t their country, or remain in a &s;tate of neutrality. At other times they tried to de|ceive the vulgar by a&s;&s;erting that the powers of Europe, accounting it their own intere&s;t to keep the colonies in &s;ubjection to Britain, would join with her in order to &s;ub|due us. With the&s;e and &s;everal other fabulous &s;tories they deceived &s;ome, who&s;e &s;implicity, timidity, or religious principles favour their de&s;ign. When the appearance of the French fleet and army detects the fallacy, they change their notes, in&s;inuating that the Congre&s;s are about to in|troduce popery among&s;t us by their alliance with France, who has it only in view to &s;eize the &s;tates for them&s;elves, when Britain &s;hall have been &s;ubdued. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Nothing can more fully di&s;cover the deceit of tho&s;e filthy hypocrites than this; for their temper and practice plainly &s;how, that of all the religious principles profe&s;&s;ed upon earth, pure prote&s;tanti&s;m would be their la&s;t choice. Were it worth while to rea&s;on with them, I would &s;ay, there is nothing in the treaty it&s;elf, nothing in the intere&s;t of the nation, and nothing in their apparent di&s;po&s;ition to favour the opini|on. That it is wholly again&s;t the concern of all Europe to maintain the balance of power, and that the imputation of favouring popery can no more ju&s;tly be fixed upon us from our alliance with France, than it could upon any other prote&s;tant nation from their alliance with them, or with any other po|pi&s;h power. Every one who will open his eyes upon the truth mu&s;t &s;ee, that a civil league by no means implies a religious one. If Luther in promoting the reformation accepted the protecti|on of popi&s;h princes, why may not we in defence of our liber|ties civil and religious? We &s;hould ble&s;s God for the help he &s;ends us, and tru&s;t him for futurity. For my own part, I freely confe&s;s, that there is &s;carcely a popi&s;h prince in Europe, with whom I would not more freely entru&s;t my religious liber|ties than with the debauched court and parliament of Britain. E&s;pecially I would much &s;ooner entru&s;t them with our generous ally, who has re&s;cinded all the laws in his kingdom that &s;tood again&s;t prote&s;tants, cho&s;e a prote&s;tant financier, and allowed him a chapel to accommodate him&s;elf and his friends, and hath &s;ent to our aid a prote&s;tant regiment with a prote&s;tant chaplain to preach to them. But our enemies have been &s;lily &s;lipping round to the other &s;ide. Who formed the Quebec bill? Gra|cious George and his generous parliament, with which lord Pitt &s;everely upbraided them, e&s;pecially the &s;piritual lords! Did the people a&s;k it? no! Was any religious profe&s;&s;ion in America, except popery, ever e&s;tabli&s;hed by an act of parlia|ment? no!

<P N="4">IV. In the fourth place we take into view our apparent inability for the mighty conflict. So weak were we, that our enemies did not entertain the lea&s;t doubt of reducing us to their terms, by a few troops and &s;hips of war; &s;o weak, that all Europe were apprehen&s;ive for the con&s;equences, and waited the event in deep &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Our internal re|&s;ources, indeed, were large; a fruitful land to furni&s;h all kinds of provi&s;ions; our men active, intelligent and brave: but our &s;trength was to be collected, and our powers im|proved. Cultivating only the common hone&s;t arts of peace, we were generally un&s;killed in the depths of &s;tate po|licy and of war; without an army; without arms and am|munition; without money and cloathing for our troops; nor had we a &s;ingle &s;hip of war, nor one ally. In this de|fencele&s;s &s;tate, tru&s;ting heaven to provide for us, we de|clared our re&s;olution to vindicate our liberties by arms, when the royal ear was clo&s;ed again&s;t our righteous and humble &s;upplications. We had at the &s;ame time to train and equip our&s;elves for the field&mdash;to fight and cultivate our farms to procure food and cloathing for our&s;elves and our army&mdash;to throw down ancient forms of government

It is hard to &s;ay which is mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing, the bravery or &s;ucce&s;s of the enterpri&s;e.

It is the Lord's doing, and marvellous in our eyes. <Q>Had not the Lord been on our &s;ide, when men ro&s;e up to &s;lay us: then they had &s;wallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled again&s;t us.

<P N="5">V. The goodne&s;s of providence in granting us a few, tho' they might &s;eem to be inadequate, preparatives for the war, merit our attention and hearty prai&s;e.

<P>By the &s;tamp act, and other artful devices to invade our liberties, the minds of our inexperienced &s;tate&s;men were rou&s;ed to attend as well to the intrigues of the Briti&s;h court, as to &s;tudy the rights of freemen, and vindicate them again&s;t any encroachments. Their rapid and &s;olid im|provements in this kind of knowledge, for which the no|ble&s;t foundation was laid in a dignity of genius early cul|tivated by various u&s;eful and well applied &s;tudies, &s;oon drew the attention of all Europe, procured the confidence of its leading powers, and obtained for them, from no le&s;s a judge than lord Pitt, the character of "able &s;tate&s;men."</P>
<P>On the &s;olid foundation they laid, we have, by the &s;miles of providence, proceeded with encrea&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s till this day.

they baffle the enemy, vanqui&s;h them often, &s;ometimes take captive whole large armaments, and per&s;evere in defending their country amid&s;t many di&s;couragements: a virtue this, that will &s;hine in the annals of America throughout all ages.

But this will be the bu&s;ine&s;s of faithful hi&s;torians and &s;kilful panegyri&s;ts. Suffice it for us to touch at &s;ome of the more intere&s;ting parts of the great &s;cene, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the devotions of the day.</P>
<P>Lexington and Bunker's Hill, Long I&s;land and White Plains, the banks of Brandywine and &s;treets of German-town, Monmouth with Stoney Point, all proclaim to our enemies, with a voice of thunder, the watchful care of heaven over America, and their own folly in expecting to make an ea&s;y conque&s;t of her.</P>
<P>But above all other parts of the whole &s;cene, the opera|tions of providence for us in New Jer&s;ey, the latter part of the year 1776 and beginning of 1777, de&s;erve the mo&s;t pe|culiar attention. In this time our illu&s;trious general is a &s;hining example of <Q>true greatne&s;s never appearing &s;o con&s;picuous as in adver&s;ity.</Q> Above two thou&s;and of his brave troops fell and were taken at fort Wa&s;hington, and the time of the militia and flying camp being expired together with the &s;hort enli&s;tment of &s;everal of his regu|lar troops, mo&s;t of them return home, and leave the ge|neral to retreat through the Jer&s;ies with the remains of his weak and &s;hattered army, before a &s;trong corps of the pur&s;uing enemy. Yet he conducteth his few fatigued and naked troops &s;afe, even in &s;ight of the enemy, cro&s;|&s;eth the Delaware, and there makes a &s;tand, till the mili|tia are once more collected.</P>
<P>Our affairs wear a mo&s;t gloomy a&s;pect at this time, &s;o gloomy, that the hearts of many begin to tremble for the fate of our little army and of North America! But af|ter a dark and &s;tormy night the morning &s;tar appears lead|ing on the approaching clear day! Our intrepid&punc; hero, at a

juncture the fitte&s;t for his purpo&s;e, recro&s;&s;eth the Dela|ware, though floating with ice and &s;now, captivates and brings off more than nine hundred He&s;&s;ians. Shortly af|terwards he keepeth the enemy in play at Trenton, until evening, and whil&s;t they imagined his troops were &s;catter|ed through the country, he marches them to Princeton, under cover of night, and defeateth the wing of their army there, the next morning, before the other wing could a rive from Trenton to their relief Without lo&s;s of time he marcheth for and takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights of Morris, whil&s;t the vanqui&s;hed and di&s;appointed Britons ha&s;te, in great con&s;ternation, for head quarters at Brun&s;wic, fired upon and galled by our militia in the way. Here they are clo&s;ed in till the following &s;pring. Upon all this part of the &s;cene are marked the brighte&s;t &s;ignatures of great gene|ral&s;hip, and the operations of providence in our favour. And here we may fix the date of our relief; a date glori|ou&s;ly pre&s;aging the future &s;ucce&s;&s;es of our arms. <Q>O that men would prai&s;e the Lord for his goodne&s;s, and for his wonderful works to the children of men.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;alm</HI> cvii. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>The enemy greatly augment their forces by &s;ea and land for the en&s;uing campaign; but by &s;ome &s;trange kind of po|licy, they divide their troops to the north and to the &s;outh which obligeth us to divide our little army. This critical moment invites us once more to behold, with wonder and prai&s;e, the power and care of divine providence for our re|lief. Whil&s;t our enemies make no doubt of &s;cattering or &s;wallowing up our &s;mall band by a divi&s;ion of their va&s;t ar|mament, and opening a pa&s;&s;age for the junction of their armies, many of them&s;elves are &s;lain, many captivated, and the re&s;t &s;hut up in Philadelphia, their pri&s;on for &s;everal months. Saratoga and Bennington are la&s;ting witne&s;&s;es of the bravery of our troops, both regulars and militia, into who&s;e hands God delivered a boa&s;tful general with his whole &s;trong army.</P>

months, until a &s;torm ari&s;ing in the &s;outh awakens them out of &s;leep. The capture of Charle&s;town and defeat of Camden alarm our fears afre&s;h, and rai&s;e the hopes of our enemies. When the prudent and brave general Greene ar|rived to take the command of the &s;outhern army, his regu|lar troops were few, the army of the enemy &s;trong, and flu&s;hed with victory, the di&s;&s;affected to the American cau&s;e numerous and violent, and the friends to it grievou&s;ly op|pre&s;&s;ed by many calamities. No place or time, &s;ince the commencement of the war, opened &s;o great a &s;cene of af|fliction as this, or more fully manife&s;ted the true &s;pirit of valour, of patrioti&s;m, and of piety. The intrepidity and re&s;olution of our troops to encounter dangers and bear their fatigues, the courage and per&s;everance of patriots under their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and the hopes of good people, can &s;carcely be equalled. A gracious God rewarded their virtue! When their night is at the darke&s;t, &s;ome morning rays beam upon them with comfort and hope. The cap|ture of a large detachment of the enemy at King's Mount|ain, and the complete defeat of another large party at Cow|pens, each much &s;uperior in number to our troops who engaged them, open a wide door of relief to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed inhabitants, and pave the way to all the following &s;ucce&s;&s;es of our arms in the &s;outh. The gallantry of tho&s;e actions cannot be fully de&s;cribed, and their &s;alutary effects were as great as the actions them&s;elves were glorious The &s;troke was followed up at Guilford, where the lo&s;s of the enemy was very con&s;iderable. Not to mention the gallantry and &s;ucce&s;s of &s;maller parties during this long campaign, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the death and captivity of more than eleven hundred of the Briti&s;h forces at Eutaw Springs, added the greate&s;t laurels to the worthy general Greene, and the corps he commanded.</P>
<P>This &s;ucce&s;sful campaign was gloriou&s;ly crowned by the capture of lord Cornwallis, with his whole army, con&s;i&s;t|ing of above &s;ix thou&s;and regular forces, and &s;everal thou|&s;and of his black aids and Refugees, on the memorable 19th of la&s;t October.

It mu&s;t appear obvious to all who will open their eyes to &s;ee, that all the circum&s;tances concurring to bring to pa&s;s the great event, clearly di&s;play the peculiar concern of heaven in it. A &s;eries of the mo&s;t delightful weather ble&s;&s;ed our troops, from the beginning of their march until the conclu&s;ion of the important &s;cene. The fleet and army appear before York in the &s;ame hour. And HE who com|mands the winds, and the &s;ea, and they obey him, com|mands, and they bring both the French fleets into the bay at the &s;ame time. Again he commands, and they fight again&s;t lord Cornwallis, throwing his troops back into their old pri&s;on, when they vainly attempted to effect an e&s;cape. No avenue of e&s;cape remains for him. The fleet of count de Gra&s;&s;e renders it impo&s;&s;ible by &s;ea&mdash;the po&s;ition of the allied army wholly prevents it by land. The only alterna|tive left for him is, to fight or &s;urrender. Fight his way he could not&mdash;&s;urrender he mu&s;t.</P>
<P>Nor may it pa&s;s unnoticed, how the furious general is &s;uffered to drive on to his own ruin, and the ruin of the king's troops. Separating his army after the action of Guilford, he leaves part of them a prey to our brave &s;outhern troops, and, by forced marches, penetrates far into the &s;tate of Virginia, with the re&s;t, plundering and de|&s;troying private property as he went; until a check being put to his mad career by the brave marquis la Fayette and general Wayne, he pu&s;heth for, and clo&s;eth him&s;elf in the &s;pot, the fitte&s;t he could choo&s;e for his own trap. And what has this cour&s;er obtained by all his violent deeds?&mdash; captivity, with the character of plunderer, robber, and murderer of mankind.

<P N="7">VII. Several incidents inter&s;per&s;ed through the &s;cene, which were overruled, by a wi&s;e providence, in our favour, though at fir&s;t many of them might &s;eem to &s;tand much again&s;t us, equally &s;tain the pride of man, and merit the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible returns of prai&s;e. Our own mi&s;takes and the mi&s;takes of the enemy were the cau&s;es of many pre&s;ent af|flictions; yet were greatly &s;ub&s;ervient to our general in|tere&s;ts. The wi&s;dom of God brought good out of evil to us, and turned our judgments into mercies. The pride and &s;elf intere&s;t of their generals, united with the folly of the Briti&s;h councils, operated much in favour of the American cau&s;e. By &s;eparating their army they obliged us to &s;epa|rate ours; by which means our militia are, on many ac|counts, much more &s;erviceable to us than they could have been, had they been called to a&s;&s;i&s;t again&s;t the whole united force of the enemy. By bribes, and employing their &s;pies, they parted with their money without obtaining their object, and with &s;ome of their be&s;t men for &s;ome of the mo&s;t infamous wretches upon earth. The &s;alvation of our beloved general and his army from Arnold's helli&s;h plot, and all the coincident providences relating thereto, de&s;erve to be wrote with a pen of iron and the point of a diamond. I might mention their folly and our advantage, &s;everal ways, in the capture of 'Statia, and attacking us on the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ide at fir&s;t, and afterwards on the weake&s;t, when the &s;tates were alarmed and prepared for war.

<P>We ought to rejoice, that the idol to which many paid their devotion, is thrown down; for, in its operation upon their minds and practices, it afforded the fulle&s;t de|mon&s;tration of the truth of that in&s;pired &s;entence, <Q>The love of money is the root of all evil.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.10</NOTE> Like the drop&s;y, it was a continual growing evil; the more the quantity encrea&s;ed, the more the thir&s;t for it encrea&s;ed.

They, like all nations that have pa&s;&s;ed their zenith, appear to be &s;inking fa&s;t downwards again&mdash;they are old and incor|rigible in national vices of the wor&s;t kind; vices of &s;o high aggravation as indicate the &s;peedy approach of divine judge|ments. There is every rea&s;on to conclude, from the te&s;timony of their own able&s;t writers, and many undeniable facts, that their &s;overeign, their court, and their nobility, are more infa|tuated and debauched than any in Europe, notwith&s;tanding their &s;uperior advantages for knowledge and virtue. But God as is his u&s;ual way with young nations, has treated, and he will treat us, as we do our children. We correct them&punc; yet nur&s;e and rai&s;e them up to maturity. He has taught us by many favours, and by the rod. Never did a nation make &s;uch rapid progre&s;s in the &s;ame &s;pace of time, in numbers, &s;trength, glory, and valuable improvements of every kind, as America has done &s;ince its fir&s;t &s;ettlement.</P><P N="2"><HI>2</HI>d. The remarkable manner in which America was at fir&s;t planted by the brave New England adventurers, who, flying from tyranny civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tic, tho&s;e to ri&s;que the dangers of the bea&s;ts and &s;avages of the wilderne&s;s, rather than continue under their hated chains.

The operations of providence united with predictions of the go&s;pel &s;hining as lightning from the ea&s;t to the we&s;t. From A&s;ia it flew to Europe, from Europe over to the wilds of Ame|rica.

individuals, to lay them low in order to rai&s;e them high, God choo&s;es his people's extremity as his opportunity to grant them relief, to teach them that his own arm works their &s;alvation, and cut off all ground of boa&s;ting from the creature. A notable in&s;tance of this we have at the en|trance of I&s;rael into the promi&s;ed land.

<P>Thus did God deal with us: After we had been brought exceeding low, he granted &s;ucce&s;s to our arms, fir&s;t in New Jer&s;ey, and afterwards in the Carolinas, in a manner &s;o remarkable, as to be a pledge of our &s;ucceeding victories, and of the glorious pro&s;pects of years and ages to come!

<P N="9">IX. From the preceding arguments, I hope, it will ea&s;ily appear to every one who is willing to &s;ee, how &s;trong and numerous are the obligations upon all the &s;tates to unite in prai&s;e to our God. His favours to the whole are great and marvellous; and our returns of gratitude &s;hould be hearty and unanimous. It has been the practice of good people, in all ages, to a&s;&s;emble together for humiliation, or prai&s;e, as the providence of God might require. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">It ought to be one of our notes of prai&s;e this day, that God has put it into the hearts of our worthy Congre&s;s to take notice of the propriety of this, and recommend to the &s;tates to obey the voice of providence by humiliation, or thank&s;giving, as it might &s;peak to us in judgment, or mercy. Thus did the pious rulers of the Jews as well as the prophets; and we ought to follow the foot&s;teps of the flock. They had &s;undry public days of thank&s;giving for public mercies, and of humi|liation for public judgments. They ob&s;erved four public fa&s;ts in the year, during their &s;eventy years captivity, as appears from the &s;eventh and eighth chapters of <HI>Zechariah.</HI> The &s;pirit of the duty was indeed neglected by the body of that nation, who, by per&s;i&s;ting in their &s;ins, made their hearts as an adamant &s;tone, as I fear is the ca&s;e with a great majority among&s;t us. Yet were the duties of &s;pecial u&s;e to them, as I hope they have been to us, as they a&s;&s;i&s;ted good people, and done public honour to their God, unto whom their prayers and prai&s;es a&s;cended as precious odours, being perfumed with the interce&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The humiliation and faithful prayers of a &s;elect few, rather than a general reformation, was the fir&s;t means of the deliverance of the Jews, as I believe they have been and will be means of ours.</NOTE> When

<P>Our rea&s;ons for prai&s;e are great and many, and &s;orry I am, that there &s;hould be any di&s;&s;onant chords to marr the harmony. But this mu&s;t be expected, while &s;in is &s;in, and prevails in our guilty world. Tho&s;e will not unite in the exalted duties of this day, who&s;e tempers are a&s;&s;imilated to the tyrants them&s;elves, and &s;ecretly wi&s;h for the &s;ucce&s;s of their arms. Nor tho&s;e who pour out imprecations on Congre&s;s, governors, a&s;&s;emblies, and councils, becau&s;e the hopes of their gains in &s;eeking the vitals of their coun|try are over. And their notes are mo&s;t un&s;uitable to the &s;weet exerci&s;es of prai&s;e, who like the unbelieving I&s;raelites in the wilderne&s;s, continually murmur at the &s;tate of our affairs, and di&s;tru&s;t the &s;alvation of God; in&s;tead of re|penting for their &s;ins, and impre&s;&s;ing their hearts with the glory of the divine government, and the many unde&s;erved favours of heaven to us. As un&s;uitable to unite with the pure choir of &s;ingers are they, who only expre&s;s their joys in Bacchanalian routs, mingling their notes with the &s;ongs of drunkards. <Q>Wo unto them&mdash;the harp and the viol, the tabret and the pipe, and wine are in their fea&s;ts; but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither con|&s;ider the operation of his hands.</Q> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;aiah</HI> 4.11, 12,</NOTE> And la&s;tly they will not offer the tribute due to their great benefactor, who, though they may call them&s;elves whigs, and a&s;&s;ume any religious name what&s;oever; yet, are &s;o &s;ullen and un|godly in their temper, that they will not meet for wor&s;hip

al&s;o. We have many great national mercies to prai&s;e him for, and many atrocious national &s;ins to be humbled for. Our &s;inning with an high hand under abounding judgments, and our ingratitude under abounding mercies, are very humbling con&s;iderations. But although we have many pre|&s;ent and marvellous mercies to prai&s;e God for, and have the &s;tronge&s;t grounds of hope for a large addition to them; yet let us not be high minded, but fear.
