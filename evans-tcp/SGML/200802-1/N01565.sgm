<P>GREAT Accompli&s;hments are needful, for the right managing of Great Affairs. The <HI>well Go|verning</HI> of a <HI>Profe&s;&s;ing People</HI> of God, is a very great Affair in|deed; and very eminent Qualifications are needful for it. Our Text gives an In&s;tance, of the well Governing of a Profe&s;&s;ing Peo|ple of God; and of the Qualifications need|ful

thereto, and exerted therein. For it tells us concerning <HI>David,</HI> who was <HI>King</HI> over <HI>I&s;rael</HI> God's Profe&s;&s;ing People, that <HI>he fed them according to the Integrity of his heart, and guided them by the Skilfulne&s;s of his hands.</HI> This <HI>P&s;alm</HI> whereof our Text is the clo&s;e, gives us an account of God's wonderful Appearances for, and merciful Dealings with, His People I&s;|rael in Egypt; of His Mercy in bringing them thence, protecting and &s;upplying them in the Wilderne&s;s, bringing them into <HI>Canaan</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them of that good Land; and of His kind Di&s;pen&s;ations to them for a con|&s;iderable time after. It al&s;o gives an ac|count, of the un&s;uitable returns which I&s;rael made, to the God and Giver of all their Mer|cies: it relates their ungrateful, di&s;obedient carriage to God. This Hi&s;tory, which briefly relates &s;undry Grand Articles of Divine Con|duct towards I&s;rael, and of their behaviour towards God, for the &s;pace of <HI>between Four and Five Hundred Years,</HI> (1 King. 6. 1.) I &s;ay, this Hi&s;tory &s;eems to pre&s;ent us, with a &s;ort of <HI>Conte&s;t</HI> between the Bounty, Mercy and Kindne&s;s of God; and the Ingratitude and Di&s;obedience of His People, as tho' there were a &s;trife which &s;hould overcome. And if we may look on this matter as a &s;ort of <HI>Conte&s;t,</HI> then God (<HI>who is merciful and gracious,

For tho' He &s;everal times &s;orely and &s;harply cha&s;ten'd them, and in His Providence plainly te&s;tify'd again&s;t their gro&s;s Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; yet on the other hand, <HI>He being full of compa&s;&s;ion, forgave their iniquity, and de&s;troyed them not; yea</HI> MANY <HI>a</HI> TIME <HI>turned be his anger away, and did not &s;tir up all hi&s; Wrath.</HI> ver. 38. Tho'God often made them &s;mart for their ill carriage, yet their Puni&s;hments were not &s;o &s;evere as their Sins de&s;erved. <HI>He dealt not with them after their Sins, neither rewarded them according to their Ini|quities,</HI> P&s;al. 103. 10. He did not yet utter|ly ca&s;t them off from being His People, nor utterly take His loving kindne&s;s from them; but His Mercy triumphed over their unwor|thine&s;s. For the Hi&s;tory in this P&s;alm is clos'd, in relating a great and remarkable In|&s;tance of God's kindne&s;s to His People; even in &s;etting an <HI>Able, Faithful and Godly Ruler ever them.</HI> This is mention'd (and that very ju&s;tly) as a plain, evident In&s;tance of his a|bundant care of, and goodne&s;s to, his People, <HI>ver.</HI> 70, 7I. <HI>He cho&s;e David al&s;o his Servant, and took him from the Sheep folds; from following the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> great with young, he brought him to feed Jacob his People, and I&s;rael his Inheritance.</HI> The Per&s;on <HI>cho&s;en</HI> was <HI>David,</HI> here call'd <HI>God's Ser|vant</HI>;

<P>The more any Per&s;on <HI>is after God's own heart,</HI> the more Inclin'd <HI>to fulfil his will</HI>; &s;o much the more fit he is to be a <HI>Ruler.</HI> This <HI>David,</HI> had been a <HI>Shepherd</HI> in a proper and literal &s;en&s;e, he had kept his Father's Sheep, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 16.11, 19. &amp; 17.15. God calls him from this work, to be a <HI>Political Shepherd</HI> to <HI>I&s;rael</HI> his co|venant Profe&s;&s;ing People.

It was an high and honourable, weighty and important work, to govern a People thus di&s;tingui&s;hingly <HI>near to God</HI>; <HI>His</HI> peculiar trea|&s;ure, portion and inheritance. Well, our Text tells us, <HI>how, David</HI> manag'd himfelf in

Further &s;till <HI>David</HI> did thus <HI>Feed</HI> and <HI>Guide</HI> them,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>According to the integrity of his heart.</HI> It &s;eems his <HI>Heart</HI> was ingag'd in the work, the weight and importance of it came home to his <HI>heart,</HI> it lay clo&s;e and near to his Spirit. He look'd not on it as a work by the by, as a trivial bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;mall concern; but his very. Soul was indeed ingag'd in it. And truly, &s;ince &s;uch a valuable <HI>Depo&s;itum,</HI> &s;uch a <HI>peculiar Trea&s;ure</HI> as <HI>Gods Covenant People</HI> were commit|ted to him, and betru&s;ted with him; 'twas highly rea&s;onable and needful, that his very <HI>heart,</HI> his Soul &s;hould be diligently imploy'd in

It may al&s;o Inti|mate, that he was <HI>Laborious</HI> in his work, <HI>&s;pared no pains,</HI> was willing to exert <HI>all his Powers and Abilities</HI> to make his People <HI>ea&s;y and happy. David</HI> was remarkable for his <HI>Skill,</HI> his <HI>Wi&s;e, Judicious</HI> Conduct, even while his Predece&s;&s;or <HI>Saul</HI> was living, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 18.5. 14, 30 And the main cour&s;e of his Conduct after he came to be <HI>King,</HI> was not le&s;s remarkable for the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Prudence,</HI> of it; only there mu&s;t be a <HI>&s;aving</HI> as to the <HI>matter of Uriah the Hittite,</HI> 1 <HI>King.</HI> 15.5. What our Text relates about <HI>Davids</HI> Conduct as a <HI>Civil Ruler</HI> among God's profe&s;&s;ing People; is recorded as an In&s;tance of God's <HI>great Favour</HI> in &s;etting &s;uch an one to Rule them; and al&s;o as an <HI>Example</HI> to be Imitated by tho&s;e, who may be concern'd in Governing &s;uch a People. Our Text there|fore may afford us this,</P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL>
Tho&s;e who are in Civil Government among a Pro|fe&s;&s;ing People of God, &s;hould Feed and Guide them with Integrity and Skilfulne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="001861_0010_0FB91EF7D65CB370">There are Three Propo&s;itions contain'd in this Doctrine. viz. (I.) <HI>Tho&s;e who are in Civil Government among a Profe&s;&s;ing People of God &s;hould Feed and Guide them.</HI> (2.) <HI>They &s;hould do it with Integrity.</HI> (3.) <HI>They &s;hould do it with Skilfulne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>PROP. I.</HI> Tho&s;e who are in Civil Govern|ment among a Profe&s;&s;ing People of God, &s;hould Feed and Guide them.</P>
<P>Here it would be ea&s;y (and po&s;&s;ibly, not altogether unnece&s;&s;ary) to premi&s;e,</P>
<P>That there are various forms of Civil Go|vernment among Men, as <HI>Monarchical, Ari&s;to|cratical, Democratical,</HI> and &s;ome of a mixed na|ture. I &s;hall add nothing by way of <HI>Compari&s;on,</HI> to &s;ay which of the&s;e is mo&s;t or lea&s;t eligible.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons concerned in the Government of a People, may have <HI>various or different bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> a&s;&s;ign'd to them: &s;ome may be concern'd in the <HI>Ligi&s;lative</HI> part, to <HI>make Laws</HI> for the good of a People, and &s;ome in the <HI>Executive</HI> part, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> good Laws <HI>well Executed</HI>: and &s;ome, po&s;&s;i|bly; (tho' under different con&s;iderations) may be concern'd in both. Again,</P>
<P>There are different <HI>Po&s;ts</HI> or <HI>Stations</HI> in Go|vernment, &s;ome <HI>Superior</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Inferior.</HI> Thus we read of the <HI>King</HI> as <HI>Supream,</HI> and of <HI>Governours as &s;ent by him,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.13, 14.
<PB N="9" REF="001861_0011_0FB91EF9568774C0">
So, there are other different Ranks, Stations, Degrees be&s;ides <HI>the&s;e two</HI> here mentioned. Con&s;equently.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e <HI>Abilities</HI> or <HI>Endowments</HI> may compe|tently fit or <HI>qualify</HI> a Per&s;on, <HI>for one Part or Sta|tion</HI> in Government, which may <HI>not for another.</HI> There were in I&s;rael, <HI>Rulers of Thou&s;ands, Rulers of Hundreds, Rulers of Fifties, and Rulers of Tens,</HI> Exod. 18 22, 25, 26. Tho&s;e may po&s;&s;ibly be qualify'd for &s;ome <HI>Inferior</HI> place in Govern|ment, which are not for a <HI>Superior.</HI> The like degree of Skill, Wi&s;dom, Prudence is not need|ful to qualify a Per&s;on for one Station or Bu|&s;ine&s;s in Government, which is needful for another that is much Superior &amp; more difficult.</P>
<P>Therefore what I &s;hall &s;ay concerning the <HI>Qualifications</HI> and <HI>Duties</HI> of tho&s;e in Authority, is to be under&s;tood generally &amp; exten&s;ively; and &s;o to be particularly applied according to the different Stations any &s;u&s;tain in Govern|ment: for that may be the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ome, which others are not immediately at all concern'd to meddle in.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things being premi&s;ed, we may a|gain a&s;&s;ert,</P>
<P><HI>Tho&s;e who are in Civil Government among a profe&s;&s;ing People of God, &s;hould Feed and Guide them.</HI> This <HI>Feeding</HI> and <HI>Guiding</HI> of them, mu&s;t needs &s;ignifie and comprehend in it (as was hinted

in opening the Words) their <HI>indeavouring the true Good Welfare</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;perity of their People. Plato</HI> could &s;ay, <HI>The People were not made for the Governour, but the Governour for the People.</HI> And this &s;eems agreable to Rom. 13.4. <HI>He is the Mini&s;ter of God to thee Good.</HI> Tho&s;e who Govern among a pro&s;ending People, &s;hould very carefully indeavour the true Welfare of their People. Therefore they &s;hould in|deavour, (I.) <HI>That their People may do Good.</HI> (2) <HI>That they may injoy Good.</HI> (3) <HI>They &s;hould indeavour to make Good Laws, and to &s;ee them well Executed, in order hereunto.</HI> Rulers &s;hould In|deavour,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That their People may do Good.</HI> Their <HI>do|ing Good,</HI> I here take in a general comprehen|&s;ive &s;en&s;e, to &s;ignifie their <HI>Living obediently to God's revealed preceptive will</HI> (as the Go&s;pel teaches, Tit. 2.12.) <HI>their denying ungodine&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts; and living &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, godlily in this pre&s;ent world.</HI> Mic. 6.8. <HI>He hath &s;hewed thee, O man what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do ju&s;tly to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</HI> It is good for Per&s;ons, to turn from Sin to God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, to live holily: this is <HI>good</HI> in a <HI>moral</HI> &s;en&s;e, it's the duty of all under the Go&s;|pel, 'tis what God requires of them. And their thus doing duty, their being &s;incerely and
<PB N="11" REF="001861_0013_0FB91F02BB572598">
practically religious and vertuous; has a di|rect <HI>natural</HI> tendercy in many regards, to promote their outward good &amp; welfare (as well as their inward comfort and joy) here in this pre&s;ent World. And further &s;till, their obedi|ence to the Go&s;pel, their conforming to God's revealed preceptive will, has a <HI>moral</HI> or fede|ral tendency to promote their true&s;t Welfare, both in this World &amp; in the next. I&s;ai. 3.10. <HI>Say to the righteous, that it &s;hall be well with him, for they &s;hall eat the fruit of their doings.</HI> 1 Tim. 4 8. <HI>Godline&s;s is pro&s;itable to all things, having the promi&s;e of the life that now is and of that which is 'to come.</HI> He that is wife, is pro&s;itable to him|&s;elf. If a Per&s;on or People heartily obey God, the advantage will be their own. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;aid to I&s;rael, Deut. 6.24. <HI>And the Lord commaded us to do all thi&s;e Statutes: to fear the Lordour God, FOR OUR GOOD always, that he might pre&s;erve us alive as it is this day.</HI> And God &s;aid of them, Deut. 5.29. <HI>Oh that there Were &s;uch an heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my com|mandments always, that is might be well with them, and with their children forever.</HI> The Prophet &s;aid to God's People, 2 Chron. 15.2,&mdash; <HI>The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; if ye &s;eek him, he will be found of you: but if ye for&s;ake him, he will for&s;ake you.</HI> For a People to be Pious, is the way to be Pro&s;perous. Deut. 29.19. <HI>Keep

therefore the words of this Covenant, and do them that ye may pro&s;per in all that ye do.</HI> 2 Chron. 24.20.&mdash;<HI>Thus &s;aith God, why tran&s;gre&s;s ye the com|mandment of the Lord, that ye cannot pro&s;per? be|cau&s;e ye have for &s;aken the Lord, he al&s;o bath for&s;a|ken you. When a mans ways plea&s;e the Lord, be maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him,</HI> Prov, 16.7. This is as true of a <HI>People</HI> as of a <HI>Per&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>It's undeniably evident from the&s;e things, that it's <HI>Good, Pro&s;itable, Advantagious</HI> to a pro|&s;e&s;&s;ing People, to live obediently unto God. God I&s; the Supream, Soveraign Maker, Owner and Ruler of all things. <HI>His Kingdom ruleth over all;</HI> and His Dominion is an Everla&s;ting Dominion. Nothing but his bounty &amp; kind|ne&s;s, can make a Per&s;on or People ea&s;y and comfortable, in Body or Soul, in Time or to Eternity. It's therefore <HI>Heatheni&s;h,</HI> or rather <HI>Athei&s;tical,</HI> to deny that it's pro&s;itable for a People to obey God. That <HI>cuning</HI> or <HI>policy,</HI> tho&s;e <HI>contrivances</HI> or <HI>alliances</HI> which put them upon doing things provoking to God; will &s;ooner or later appear to be, <HI>&s;en&s;ele&s;s folly,</HI> or <HI>mi&s;chievous craft</HI> (like <HI>Gideons</HI> Ephod, <HI>Judg.</HI> 8.27.) 'twill prove a <HI>Snare</HI> to them. For what|ever Mens cuning or policy may &s;ugge&s;t, yet <HI>their iniquities will &s;eparate between them &amp; their God: their &s;ins will bide away his face that he will
