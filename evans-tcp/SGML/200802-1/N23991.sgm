<Q>BUT WILL GOD INDEED DWELL ON THE EARTH? BEHOLD THE HEAVEN AND HEAVEN OF HEAVENS CANNOT CONTAIN THEE, HOW MUCH LESS THIS HOUSE THAT I HAVE BUILDED?</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE is no one of the divine perfections, on which we can &s;eriou&s;ly reflect without being lo&s;t in wonder.</P>
<P>WHEN we ca&s;t our thoughts back to the ages preceding the creation, and reflect that the &s;pace which is now occupied by this earth, by the&s;e heav|ens, and by the univer&s;e it&s;elf, was then a mighty void;&mdash;that there was not a &s;ingle particle of matter, or a ray of created light, in all this boundle&s;s extent, we are amazed at beholding this material &s;y&s;tem ri&s;|ing in&s;tantaneou&s;ly into life. That creation, of which we can entertain any tolerable conception, is nothing more than the change of one thing into another.&mdash;When a tree, or a plant is produced, certain particles from the earth, and air are differently arranged, placed in a new relation to each other, and thus a&s;&s;ume a
<PB N="6" REF="031740_0005_0FEE2BAAC6CBFD80">
new appearance. Yet &s;trictly &s;peaking, there is in all this no new creation; matter only a&s;&s;umes a differ|ent form:&mdash;all the materials were provided before. But there was a time, when there were no materials in the univer&s;e; and when all the matter, which is now in exi&s;tence, was created from nothing. This &s;urpa&s;&s;es our comprehen&s;ion, and the thought con|founds us. Our a&s;toni&s;hment &s;till increa&s;es when we are told that all this took place, without any thing like that which is called <HI>labour,</HI> or <HI>exertion.</HI> God <HI>&s;pake</HI> and it was <HI>done.</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>Let there be light,</HI> and <HI>there was light. By the word of the Lord, were the heavens made, and all the ho&s;ts of them, by the breath of his mouth. He &s;haketh the earth out of its place, and the pillars thereof tremble: He commandeth the &s;un, and it ri&s;eth not, and &s;ealeth up the &s;tars; he alone &s;tretcheth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the &s;ea.</HI></P>
<P>THE eternity of God is equally incomprehen|&s;ible with his power.&mdash;To every object which we be|hold, <HI>there is a &s;ea&s;on and a time.</HI> A time for its be|ginning, duration, and de&s;truction. It can be &s;aid of none of the objects, which fall within our view, that it has been even &s;o forever, there was a time wh<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> they were not. But the &s;upreme God is the <HI>King eternal and immortal;</HI> he is <HI>without beginning of days, or end of life.</HI> Look back to the time when he fir&s;t exerted his creating power: fix this period as far di&s;tant as you plea&s;e. Call in, to the aid of your imagination, all the leaves that are &s;haken in the
<PB N="7" REF="031740_0006_0FEE2BAFD811AEA0">
wind, all the grains of du&s;t, that compo&s;e this globe; all the drops of water which the ocean contains: and all the drops of water which the ocean contains: and all the particles of light which con&s;tantly, and in every direction, emanate from the &s;un; let each leaf, each grain, each drop of water, and each ray of light be put to &s;ignify an hundred years.&mdash;Then &s;ay that as many years have elap&s;ed, &s;ince God began to create, as are &s;ignified by this inconceivable multitude of leaves, particles, &amp;c. Let this be con&s;idered as one Era, in the divine exi&s;tence. Imagine that the commencement of it is a point, from which you are to begin a new calculation: and enquire how long the Deity exi&s;ted before he began to create.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE, again, that each one of the&s;e drops, grains, &amp;c. is divi&s;ible into a thou&s;and parts, and that each of the&s;e parts, was placed for a thou&s;and years. Say, then, that God had exi&s;ted before he began to create for a duration, con&s;i&s;ting of as many years as all the&s;e parts expre&s;s.&mdash;This &s;econd Era will be a million times longer than the fir&s;t, but &s;till it bears no proportion to the divine exi&s;tence.&mdash;We lo&s;e our|&s;elves in the calculation, and approach no nigher to the divine origin. There never was a time when God did not exi&s;t. <HI>He inhabiteth eternity. He is and was, and is to come.</HI> He alone can &s;ay, <HI>Before me there was no God, neither &s;hall there be any after me.</HI></P>
<P>IT is inconceiveable by us, how any being &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of perfect independence. Every ob|ject
<PB N="8" REF="031740_0007_0FEE2BB42BF1F060">
which we &s;ee, depends on &s;ome other for its ori|gin, its properties, and its duration. All the objects which we &s;ee are the effects of &s;ome cau&s;e. When we ob&s;erve a well cultivated field, we know that it was not the effect of chance; we know that &s;ome intelligent agent has been employed. When we ob|&s;erve a building, we know that it mu&s;t have been the effect of human art. <HI>For every hou&s;e is builded by &s;ome man.</HI> We know likewi&s;e, that there was a time, when this world did not exi&s;t; that it is the effect of &s;ome cau&s;e, and dependent on &s;ome &s;uperior be|ing. We next contemplate this being, and can hard|ly be re&s;trained from proceeding in our u&s;ual mode, and from enquiring into the origin of the Deity. But reflecting on the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch an enquiry, we are obliged to adopt this conclu&s;ion, that there is a being, who is uncreated and independent, although we are utterly unable to conceive how &s;uch a thing is po&s;&s;ible. He alone can adopt the following lan|guage, "<HI>I am, and there is none el&s;e be&s;ide. Before the day was, I was." "If I were hungry, I would not tell thee, for the world is mine, and the fulne&s;s thereof."</HI></P>
<P>BUT we proceed to con&s;ider that attribute of God, which is &s;poken of in the text, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the divine im|men&s;ity, or omnipre&s;ence. "Will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven, even the heaven of heavens cannot contain him."</P>
<P>THIS thought occurred to the mind of King Sol|omon in the mid&s;t of the prayer, which he made at
<PB N="9" REF="031740_0008_0FEE75B2F7D9E5B8">
the dedication of the temple:&mdash;It is a con&s;ideration, which ought to impre&s;s our minds while engaged in the &s;olemnities of this day.</P>
<P>WE are &s;o much conver&s;ant with material objects; we have &s;o frequently heard it &s;aid that no body can be in two places at the &s;ame time; we are &s;o con|&s;tantly &s;eeing bodies move from one place to another, as that it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to form any ju&s;t ideas of a being who is incapable of moving from place to place, but is equally pre&s;ent in all places. All the ju&s;t conceptions, which we can po&s;&s;ibly have of the divine immen&s;ity, is by comparing our ideas of God, with the ideas, which we entertain of finite objects. As it is much ea&s;ier to tell what the Deity is not, than what he is; &s;o it is much more practicable to &s;how what lines will not circum&s;cribe him, than to form any right notions of the real extent of his pre&s;ence. We mea&s;ure &s;pace by the di&s;tances at which different material objects are placed from each other. We &s;ay that all that &s;pace over which our eyes can glance, does not confine the Deity: that he is pre&s;ent, not only in every place on this globe, but that he is equally &s;o, at all the bodies which &s;urround this globe: that the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;tar, which can be di&s;|cerned is as really in the divine pre&s;ence as we are. Solomon him&s;elf could form no other conception of the divine greatne&s;s, but what he obtained by &s;uch compari&s;ons. <HI>Heaven, and the heaven of heavens can|not contain thee.</HI> This was acknowledging him&s;elf un|able
<PB N="10" REF="031740_0009_0FEE2BBAEC6DEE90">
to comprehend the omnipre&s;ence of God. For he has here taken into view the greate&s;t expan&s;e which can be defined, and of which he had any idea, and yet he a&s;&s;erts that this cannot circum&s;cribe the pre&s;|ence of God.</P>
<P>"THE Hebrews" we are told "acknowledged three heavens, the fir&s;t, the aerial heavens, in which the birds fly, the winds blow, and the &s;howers are formed: the &s;econd, the firmament, in which the &s;tars are placed: the third, the heaven of heavens, the re&s;idence of the Almighty, and abode of &s;aints and angels." The&s;e, doubtle&s;s, were the ideas, which the &s;acred writers entertained on the &s;ubject. They frequently &s;peak of the&s;e different heavens.</P>
<P>WHEN it is &s;aid, <HI>There is a multitude of water in the heavens: The rain cometh down, and the &s;now from heaven: Can the heavens give &s;howers,</HI> &amp;c. re&s;pect is evidently had to the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> or aerial heaven.</P>
<P>WHEN it is &s;aid, <HI>The &s;tars &s;hall fall from heaven. The heavens declare the glory of the Lord, and the firm|ament &s;howeth his handy work: By his &s;pirit, he has garni&s;hed the heavens,</HI> &amp;c. the in&s;pired writers plainly allude to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> heaven, or the region of the &s;tars.</P>
<P>BUT God is &s;aid by the P&s;almi&s;t to have <HI>&s;et his glory above the heavens:</HI> i. e. above the fir&s;t, and &s;ec|ond heavens; which exactly comports with the ideas
<PB N="11" REF="031740_0010_0FEE2BBC75EAD758">
which the Jews entertained of the place of the divine re&s;idence&mdash;St. Paul &s;peaks of <HI>the throne of maje&s;ty in the heavens:</HI>&mdash;of being <HI>caught up to the third heaven.</HI> Stephen &s;aw <HI>the heavens opened, and Je&s;us &s;tanding at the right hand of God. God is &s;aid to ride upon the heaven of heavens.</HI></P>
<P>WE &s;ee then what the author of our text meant by <HI>the heaven of heavens:</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the &s;pace which lies far beyond all material objects, &s;uch as the moon, the &s;un, and the fixed &s;tars:&mdash;the &s;pace, in which, he &s;uppo&s;ed the angels were convened; and where the Almighty dwelt in light inacce&s;&s;ible and full of glory, which no mortal eye hath &s;een or can &s;ee. This, he confe&s;&s;es, cannot confine the Almighty.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE that the farthe&s;t &s;tar, which we ever behold, is placed at a di&s;tance, expre&s;&s;ed in miles, by millions multiplied by millions. Let an angel be &s;ta|tioned at this &s;tar, and from thence, commence his flight unto boundle&s;s &s;pace; let him proceed with the greate&s;t conceivable velocity, and let his flight be continued through the greate&s;t duration of which the mind can form any idea, he is yet &s;urrounded by God; he has not found the place where God is not pre&s;ent. <HI>Can&s;t thou by &s;earching find out God: cau&s;t thou know the Almighty to perfection? Whither &s;hall I go from thy &s;pirit: or whither &s;hall I flee from thy pre&s;ence? Thy pre&s;ence filleth heaven and earth. But the heaven, and the heaven of heavens can not contain thee?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="031740_0011_0FEE2BC8B7E48090">
IN contemplation of the divine immen&s;ity, it is natural to enquire, with the devout King of I&s;rael, <HI>Will God indeed dwell on the earth?</HI> If God is pre&s;|ent in all places, and fills the Univer&s;e, with what propriety can it be &s;aid, that He is peculiarly pre&s;ent in any particular place? Yet the &s;criptures &s;peak of God's being in Heaven&mdash;of his appearing on mount Sinai&mdash;of his appearing to Mo&s;es in the burning bu&s;h;&mdash;of his being in the Jewi&s;h temple, and in all religious a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to this, we ob&s;erve fir&s;t, that by &s;uch repre&s;entations, cannot be meant that God is e&s;&s;en|tially, more pre&s;ent in one place than another; he cannot, if we may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, contract him|&s;elf into one place, and withdraw him&s;elf from other places. Accordingly, the &s;criptures teach us, that he is as really pre&s;ent in the caves of a mountain, in the bowels of the earth, or in the bottom of the &s;ea, as in the heavens above. <HI>Do I not fill heaven and earth, &s;aith the Lord? Though they dig into hell, thence &s;hall mine hand take them: though they climb up into heaven, thence will I bring them down: though they hide them|&s;elves in the top of Carmel, I will &s;earch them out thence: and though they be hid in the bottom of the &s;ea, thence will I command the &s;erpent, and he &s;hall bite them.</HI></P>
<P>GOD is as really pre&s;ent in the humble cottage, or the open field; as in the &s;plendid palace, or ma|je&s;tic temple.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="031740_0012_0FEE2BCE283AA908">
BUT in the &s;tile of &s;cripture, the Deity is &s;aid to be pre&s;ent in all places, where he makes any peculiar manife&s;tations of him&s;elf; where he places &s;uch ob|jects and produces &s;uch appearances and effects, as give to beholders, the mo&s;t lively conceptions of his energy and attributes.</P>
<P>THE &s;acred writers repre&s;ent him, as &s;itting on a throne in the heavens;&mdash;as being &s;urrounded by ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and glorified &s;pirits.</P>
<P>THERE is, probably, &s;omewhere, in the univer&s;e, a place where God makes a mo&s;t clear, and glorious di&s;covery of his nature and perfections; where he conde&s;cends to be viewed, not as by us, through the medium of <HI>clouds and darkne&s;s;</HI> but in a light too re&s;plendent for our pre&s;ent organs of vi&s;ion; a light, which no mortal can approach unto. And as the pure&s;t and mo&s;t exalted beings would not only be mo&s;t de&s;irous of acquainting them&s;elves with the divine nature; but would likewi&s;e be more than all others prepared for enjoying the cleare&s;t manife&s;ta|tions of God, it is extremely rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that this glorious place is filled with an innumerable multitude of &s;aints and angels.</P>
<P>THIS repre&s;entation will an&s;wer to the very fig|urative de&s;cription which Micaiah gave of the objects which he &s;aw in vi&s;ion. <HI>I &s;aw the Lord &s;itting on a throne and all the ho&s;ts of heaven &s;tanding by him, on his right hand, and on his left.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="031740_0013_0FEE2BD0E8D2CA58">
WE are not to &s;uppo&s;e, however, that the Deity is really vi&s;ible, in any place. He is a &s;pirit, and no one hath &s;een God, at any time.</P>
<P>THE Almighty is &s;aid to have appeared to Mo|&s;es, in the bu&s;h: yet we cannot imagine that God was any more in that burning bu&s;h, than in any oth|er place whatever. But as the bu&s;h was on fire, without being con&s;umed, there was a very evident and &s;triking proof of the divine energy.</P>
<P>GOD is &s;aid to have appeared, when, in order to impre&s;s the minds of men, with a &s;en&s;e of his power and pre&s;ence, he has cau&s;ed &s;ome remarkable lu|minous appearance. This was the ca&s;e, when <HI>Mo&s;es and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and &s;eventy of the elders &s;aw the God of I&s;rael: when there was under his feet, as it were, a paved work of &s;apphire: and as it were the body of heaven in his clearne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>IN the ancient tabernacle, and in the Jewi&s;h tem|ple, there was the Shekinah, or a vi&s;ible light in te&s;|timony of the divine pre&s;ence. Before Solomon made his dedication prayer, <HI>It came to pa&s;s that when the prie&s;ts had come out of the holy place, the cloud filled the hou&s;e of the Lord: So that the prie&s;ts could not &s;tand to mini&s;ter becau&s;e of the cloud: for the glory of the Lord had filled the hou&s;e of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this God was in reality, no more pre&s;ent in Solomon's temple, than he now is
<PB N="15" REF="031740_0014_0FED382DA832E4C0">
in chri&s;tian churches. But &s;uch an appearance as was then made, exactly corre&s;ponded with the genius of the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation. Every thing, under this economy was calculated to &s;trike upon the &s;en&s;es. They had a variety of rites, forms and ceremonies. A pure, &s;imple, and &s;piritual wor&s;hip, would have been ill received by a people, ignorant, gro&s;s, and uncultivated. They needed &s;omething of external pomp, to captivate their attention.</P>
<P>BUT it is very evident from the prayer of Solo|mon, that he expected the Deity to make &s;ome man|ife&s;tation of him&s;elf in that temple, &s;eparate from that glorious light, which filled the holy place. He be|lieved that religious wor&s;hip there performed, would be more acceptable to God, than if it were performed in a different place; and that God would be more likely to meet his people and an&s;wer their prayers when they a&s;&s;embled at the temple for public wor&s;h|ip, than if they wholly neglected divine &s;ervice, or convened in a different temple. He believed that the <HI>eyes of God would be open towards that hou&s;e, day and night.</HI> For when he intercedes with God, in be|half of his people, it is on condition that they &s;hould pray, either in, or towards that hou&s;e. <HI>When thy peo|ple I&s;rael be &s;mitten down before the enemy, becau&s;e they have &s;inned again&s;t thee, and &s;hall turn again, and confe&s;s thy name, and pray, and make &s;upplication unto the Lord,</HI> in this hou&s;e; <HI>then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the &s;in of thy people I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="031740_0015_0FEE2BFB764C48A8">
IN this &s;en&s;e, God is now pre&s;ent in all chri&s;tian churches. Public wor&s;hip, is an in&s;titution which he has ordained; and we cannot doubt his readine&s;s to ble&s;s the means which are of his own appointment. The &s;ame encouragement is given to religious a&s;&s;em|blies, under both di&s;pen&s;ations. To the I&s;raelites it was &s;aid, <HI>In all places where I record my name, I will come unto thee, and ble&s;s thee.</HI> To the di&s;ciples of Je|&s;us, it is &s;aid, <HI>Where two or three are met together in my name, there will I be in the mid&s;t of them and ble&s;s them.</HI></P>
<P>CHRISTIAN temples, and chri&s;tian wor&s;hip are extremely different from the temple and wor&s;hip of the Jews. Chri&s;tianity con&s;iders its votaries as &s;pir|itual. Jewdai&s;m addre&s;&s;ed it&s;elf much more the &s;en&s;es. It was <HI>the law of a carnal commandment.</HI> Their religious &s;ervice <HI>&s;tood in meats and drinks, and divers wa&s;hings, and carnal ordinances, impo&s;ed on them until the time of reformation.</HI> This time of reformation came, when chri&s;tianity was fir&s;t introduced, and the pomp and ceremony of the Mo&s;aic e&s;tabli&s;hment were done away. <HI>The law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did.</HI> Accordingly, our Saviour declares, <HI>The hour cometh, when ye &s;hall, neither in the mountain of Samaria, nor yet at Jeru&s;alem, wor&s;hip the Father.</HI> He faith further, <HI>The hour cometh, and now is, when the true wor&s;hippers &s;hall wor&s;hip the Father, in &s;pirit and in truth: for the Father &s;eeketh &s;uch to wor&s;hip him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="031740_0016_0FEE75B7511A8A40">
IN chri&s;tian churches, there is no Shekinah, or vi&s;ible token of the divine pre&s;ence; yet Chri&s;t has promi&s;ed to be in the mid&s;t of his wor&s;hipping &s;er|vants.</P>
<P>IN chri&s;tian churches, there is no &s;acred fire, no place an&s;wering to the Jewi&s;h holy of holies, no incen&s;e evening and morning &s;acrifices or &s;prinkling of blood. Our prayers are to a&s;cend up in&s;tead of incen&s;e, and the lifting up of our hands to be as the <HI>evening &s;acrifice.</HI> The way into the holy of holies is how laid open; even that new and living way which Chri&s;t has con&s;ecrated through the veil.</P>
<P>IN the chri&s;tian church, there is no &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of high prie&s;ts who are to offer, fir&s;t for their own &s;ins, and then for the &s;ins of the people: But <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the high prie&s;t over the hou&s;e of God: He has appeared to take away &s;in by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf: and by one offering he has forever perfected them that are &s;anctified. Let us, therefore, draw near with a true heart, in full a&s;&s;urance of faith, having our hearts &s;prink|led from an evil con&s;cience, and our bodies wa&s;hed with pure water.</HI></P>
<P>AS God manife&s;ted him&s;elf in a peculiar man|ner to the Jewi&s;h wor&s;hippers in the temple, &s;o has he, in all ages of the go&s;pel, to chri&s;tian a&s;&s;emblies. The a&s;toni&s;hing &s;pread of chri&s;tianity &s;oon after our Saviour's re&s;urrection, was brought about, under
<PB N="18" REF="031740_0017_0FEE75B8D84057F0">
God, by public preaching. It was by the preaching of Peter, that three thou&s;and &s;ouls were, in one day, added to the church. It was by the preaching of Paul and Barnabas in the &s;ynagogue, that <HI>a great mul|titude both of the Jews and Greeks believed</HI> in Iconium. It was becau&s;e St. Paul rea&s;oned in the Corinthian &s;ynagogue, that he per&s;uaded the Jews and the Greeks. And although it is certain that <HI>all</HI> who were thus per&s;uaded, and the <HI>whole</HI> church which he (thus per&s;uaded) e&s;tabli&s;hed at Corinth, were not really re|ligious, yet the alteration which took place with re|gard to many of them, was &s;o great, as to afford a &s;triking proof of the divine power and pre&s;ence. For after &s;peaking to the Corinthian di&s;ciples, of <HI>forni|cators, idolaters, effeminate, thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers, and extortioners,</HI> he &s;ubjoins, <HI>And &s;uch were &s;ome of you: but ye are wa&s;hed, but ye are ju&s;tified, but ye are &s;anctified.</HI> When &s;o many men, infamous for every &s;pecies of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, were per&s;uaded to em|brace the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and did afterwards adorn the doctrines which it contained; when they were turned not only from darkne&s;s unto light, but al&s;o, from the dominion of &s;in, to the practice of holine&s;s, was not the divine energy as fully manife&s;ted in the chri&s;tian mini&s;try, as was <HI>the glory of the Lord,</HI> in the Jewi&s;h temple?</P>
<P>THE effects of chri&s;tian mini&s;trations have not, in latter ages, been &s;o obvious and &s;urprizing; and from the difference between the circum&s;tances of

<P>WE cannot doubt however, that the divine &s;pirit yet attends on a preached word, and that by the co|operation of both the&s;e, the kingdom of Chri&s;t is con|tinually enlarged. <HI>For as the rain cometh down, and the &s;now from heaven, and returneth not thither, but wat|ereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth, and bud, that it may give &s;eed to the &s;ower, and bread to the eater: So &s;hall my word be, &s;aith the Lord, that goeth forth out of my mouth: it &s;hall not return unto me void: but it &s;hall accompli&s;h that which I plea&s;e, and pro&s;per in the thing, where unto I &s;end it.

great, as that the heaven, even the heaven of heav|ens cannot contain them? Do the wi&s;e and honora|ble &s;earch the hearts and try the reins of the children of men? Are the darkne&s;s and the light both alike to them? Do they compo&s;e a tribunal at which each individual mu&s;t hereafter be arraigned? Have the wi&s;e and honorable eternal rewards, and eternal puni&s;hments at their di&s;po&s;al? Are they able to de|&s;troy both &s;oul and body in hell? If not, <HI>Who art thou, that &s;hould&s;t be afraid of a man that &s;hall die, and the &s;on of man that &s;hall be made as gra&s;s, and forgette&s;t the Lord thy maker, that &s;tretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundation of the earth?</HI></P>
<P>WE may long lie concealed from the in&s;pection of our fellow men. Some of the vile&s;t of mortals are wrapt about &s;o completely in the externals of de|votion, as to obtain for the greater part of their lives, a reputation for extraordinary &s;anctity and upright|ne&s;s. They may ble&s;s them&s;elves in the &s;ucce&s;s of their hypocri&s;y; they may exult in the pious frauds, which they have played off, upon the world. But what avails this, when their <HI>&s;ecret &s;ins are all in the light of God's countenance? There is no darkne&s;s or &s;hadow of death, where the workers of iniquity can hide them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>LET no one therefore think there is any veil &s;o thick, or any darkne&s;s &s;o gro&s;s, through which the eye of God cannot penetrate! Let no one imagine

that becau&s;e he commits his wickedne&s;s in retirement from the world, he thereby evades the pre&s;ence of the Almighty. <HI>Woe unto them that &s;eek deep to hide their coun&s;el from the Lord: and their works are in the dark: And they &s;ay who &s;eeth it? Who knoweth it?</HI></P>
<P>LET us remember that wherever we are, and in what employment &s;oever we are engaged, whether in devotion, whether in the bu&s;ine&s;s or the amu&s;ements of life, we are &s;urrounded by the divine pre&s;ence; that our actions, our thoughts, and mo&s;t &s;ecret de&s;ires are open and naked to his view.</P>

<P>THIS God, who&s;e greatne&s;s is un&s;earchable, who circum&s;cribes with his pre&s;ence, all beings, and all

<P>BY the per&s;on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he has given, in the different periods of the church, <HI>&s;ome apo&s;tles and &s;ome prophets, and &s;ome evengeli&s;ts: and &s;ome pa&s;tors and teachers, for perfecting the &s;aints for the work of the min|i&s;try: and for edifying the body of Chri&s;t.</HI> He man|ife&s;ts him&s;elf in religious a&s;&s;emblies: He hears the prayers which are offered, and ble&s;&s;es the word which is &s;poken.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE foregoing ob&s;ervations teach us, that when we a&s;&s;emble for public wor&s;hip, it &s;hould be with reverance, and humility. What adoration is due from feeble, dependant creatures, to that being, on who&s;e greatne&s;s, we have been now contemplat|ing!

plea&s;ed God, by the fooli&s;hne&s;s of preaching to &s;ave them that believe:</HI> and further;&mdash;when we reflect on the probability there is, that tho&s;e who do not, by the means which God has appointed, attain to virtue and holine&s;s, will forever remain enemies to God, by wicked works: it mu&s;t appear infinitely important, <HI>how</HI> the go&s;pel is preached, and in what manner it is received; <HI>Take heed therefore, how ye hear.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN in the hou&s;e of divine wor&s;hip, reflect that <HI>God will indeed dwell upon the earth,</HI> and although <HI>the heaven, even the heaven of heavens cannot contain him,</HI> yet his favour may be &s;ought, and his ble&s;&s;ing expected, <HI>in this hou&s;e which ye have built.</HI> He draws nigh unto us, in the mini&s;try of reconciliation, and who&s;oever will, is invited to come and take of the waters of life freely.

For <HI>Except the Lord build the hou&s;e, they labour in vain who build it.</HI> It is he who hath girded us with &s;trength, and hath made our way

perfect. <HI>O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth forever.</HI></P>
<P>THE la&s;t con&s;ideration which we &s;hall bring to view, is the purpo&s;e for which this hou&s;e was erected. If &s;o much zeal and activity were well employed in preparing a &s;anctuary, in which to attend on the means of grace: how much more important is it to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that moral purity and love to God, to the attainment of which all the&s;e means are to be &s;ub&s;ervient.</P>
<P>LET not the means content us, while the end is not an&s;wered. Let it never be forgotten, that the de&s;ign, for which we convene in this earthly temple, is that we may hereafter become <HI>pillars in the temple of our God.</HI></P>
<P>AND now <HI>May the Lord who made heaven and earth, ble&s;s you out of Zion!</HI> May the influences of his Holy Spirit, accompany the exhortations that &s;hall here be delivered: May our prayers come up with acceptance from this alter, and may <HI>God glorify the hou&s;e of his glory.</HI> And finally,</P>
<P>MAY you be <HI>built upon the foundation of the proph|ets and apo&s;tles, Je&s;us Chri&s;t being the chief corner &s;tone, in whom, all the building, fitly framed together, grow|eth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom may ye al&s;o, be builden together for an habitation of God, through the Spirit.</HI></P>
