<Q><HI>Finally, brethren, farewell: Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace &s;hall be with you.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>CORINTH was a famous city of Greece; in which the go&s;pel was introduced and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Apo&s;tle Paul. There he exerci&s;ed his mini&s;try for a year and &s;ix months at one time, be&s;ides his occa&s;ional vi&s;its afterward. There his mini&s;try was attended with great &s;ucce&s;s. All this appears, as from other pa&s;&s;ages in the New-Te&s;tament, &s;o particularly from Acts XVIII. 9, 10, 11. <Q>Then &s;pake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vi&s;ion. Be not afraid, but &s;peak, and hold not thy peace. For I am with thee, and no man &s;hall &s;et on thee, to hurt thee; for I have much people in this city. And he continued there a year and &s;ix months, teaching the word of God among them.</Q> To this church planted by the apo&s;tle him&s;elf, he wrote two epi&s;tles, of which this from which our text is taken is the la&s;t. At the clo&s;e of this epi&s;tle, he takes his final leave of this church, in the affecting words of the text. As if he had &s;aid, And now, brethren, after all my acquaintance with you, which has been mutually &s;o agreeable and profitable; after all my la|bours among you, which God has been plea&s;ed &s;o greatly to ble&s;s; and after my repeated vi&s;its and epi&s;tles to you; I bid you an affectionate and final farewell. I ardently wi&s;h you pro&s;perity in every re&s;pect; and particularly that you may <Q>be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and then the God of love and peace &s;hall be with you.</Q></P>
<P>WHAT I propo&s;e in this di&s;cour&s;e, is to con&s;ider the &s;e|veral parts of this farewell of the Apo&s;tle, to the Corinthians.</P>
<P N="1">1. HE wi&s;hes them to be perfect.&mdash;We are not to un|der&s;tand here ab&s;olute, &s;inle&s;s perfection. This is not attain|able in this life. "There is not" even <Q>a ju&s;t man upon earth; that doth good and &s;inneth not.</Q> Eccles. VII. 20. "And who can &s;ay, I have made my heart clean; I am pure from my &s;in:" Prov. XX. 9. "Who can bring a clean thing, out of an unclean? Not one." Job. XIV. 4. But if any man has attained to perfection in this life, he is a ju&s;t man upon earth, that doth good and &s;inneth not: he is pure from his &s;in: he is a clean thing brought out of an unclean; in direct contradiction to the &s;criptures ju&s;t quoted.</P>
<P>IF any per&s;on ever has attained to perfection, in this life we may &s;urely &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ome of the Saints mentioned
<PB N="3" REF="035438_0003_1004C87776883480">
in &s;cripture, were favored with this privilege. Therefore let us &s;earch for perfection among the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed Saints of both the old Te&s;tament and the new. Noah, Dan|iel and Job are in &s;cripture mentioned as eminent Saints and as peculiarly beloved of God. Let us attend to them di&s;|tinctly. Noah, tho' di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of the world, in being &s;aved from the flood and in being employed as a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s to the old world; and tho in the main he walked with God; yet was overtaken with gro&s;s intemperance, as you cannot but remember.&mdash;Job, was indeed an eminently good man, &s;o that there was none like him in all the earth, and for a long time he per&s;evered in his patience, under various mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing afflictions, brought on him in a rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and for a long time he conduct|ed him&s;elf in the mo&s;t humble and pious manner, <Q>falling down to the ground and wor&s;hipping;</Q> &s;aying, "naked came I out of my mother's womb and naked &s;hall I return.</P>
<P>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; and ble&s;&s;|ed be the name of the Lord:" and when he was in&s;ulted by his own wife, becau&s;e he &s;till retained his integrity, and refu&s;ed to cur&s;e God and die, he made the following mo&s;t proper and pious an&s;wer. <Q>What? &s;hall we receive good at the hand of the Lord, and &s;hall we not receive evil.</Q> Yet to &s;how, that there is no man, upon earth, tho really ju&s;t and upright, who liveth and &s;inneth not; Job at la&s;t had his patience exhau&s;ted, &s;o that he "opened his mouth &amp; cur&s;|ed his day."</P>
<P>WITH regard to Daniel, tho no particular gro&s;s &s;in, is in &s;cripture recorded concerning him, yet we have no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that he was more perfect, than the other two &s;aints, with whom he is cla&s;&s;ed in &s;cripture, as a di&s;tingui&s;hed fa|vorite of God.</P>
<P>ABRAHAM was the father of the faithful, and the friend of God; yet he was not &s;inle&s;s: he fell into polygamy and lived in it for a long time.&mdash;As to David, in general a man after God's own heart, you know the great &s;ins into which he fell.</P>
<P>MOSES was a di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;aint, and the meeke&s;t of men: yet he tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed at the waters of Meribah, &s;o that he was &s;hut out of the good land. But let us come to the new te&s;tament.</P>
<P>THE eleven apo&s;tles, from their con&s;tant attendance on the preaching and miracles of our Lord, and from their daily conception and intimate intercour&s;e with him, were under great advantages for Chri&s;tian edification. Yet they fell &s;hort of perfection. For when the multitudes from the chief
<PB N="4" REF="035438_0004_1004C879457CB960">
prie&s;ts and elders, came with &s;words and &s;tones, to take Je|&s;us, his di&s;ciples "all for&s;ook him and fled."</P>
<P>PAUL was the great Apo&s;tle of the gentiles, was <Q>not a whit behind the very chiefe&s;t Apo&s;tles;</Q> was <Q>a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el to God, to bear his name before the gentiles, &amp; Kings, &amp; the children of I&s;rael;</Q> and appears to have done more to &s;pread the go&s;pel in the world, than any of the other Apo&s;tles; yet according to his own te&s;timony, he came &s;hort of perfecti|on; Phil. III. 12&mdash;15. <Q>Not as tho' I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which al&s;o I am apprehended of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Brethren, I count not my&s;elf to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting tho&s;e things which are behind, and reaching forth unto tho&s;e things which are before, I pre&s;s toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</Q> This you &s;ee is an ex|pre&s;s confe&s;&s;ion of his own imperfection. The &s;ame thing is manife&s;t from this, that when the Apo&s;tle <Q>would do good, evil was pre&s;ent with him;</Q> and that <Q>he had a law in his members warring again&s;t the law of his mind, and bringing him into captivity to the law of &s;in, which was in his member.</Q>&mdash;This &s;urely is not the de|&s;cription of a perfect man.&mdash;If it &s;hould be &s;aid, as it has been &s;aid, that the apo&s;tle is here de&s;cribing his &s;tate before his conver&s;ion and not after; I an&s;wer, that in the &s;ame con|text, and even in the next words he declares, that he <Q>de|lighted in the law of God, after the inward man; &amp; that with the mind he &s;erved the law of God;</Q> which no un|converted man does; becau&s;e <Q>the carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God, and is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</Q> And if it were otherwi&s;e; if an unconverted man could delight in the law of God, after the inward man, he could and would of cour&s;e delight in God him&s;elf, &amp; love him &s;incerely. And if he could &s;erve the law of God; he would of cour&s;e &s;erve God him&s;elf. And what is there more difficult in any part of religion, or more di&s;tingui&s;hing of its truth and genuinene&s;s, than the &s;incere love and &s;ervice of the law and of God him&s;elf? Indeed this is the root of all true religion and virtually con&s;titutes the whole.</P>
<P>THUS we have taken a view of the mo&s;t eminent Saints of &s;cripture, and find none among them all, who profe&s;s to have attained to perfection; and concerning mo&s;t of them, we find evident proofs of imperfection. They manife&s;tly fell &s;hort of &s;inle&s;s perfection.</P>
<P>IF this be &s;o, it may be &s;aid; if &s;inle&s;s perfection be not
<PB N="5" REF="035438_0005_1004C87BC65E2C38">
attainable in this life; what does the apo&s;tle mean in our text; when he exhorts the Corinthians to be <HI>perfect?</HI></P>
<P>I ANSWER, he doubtle&s;s means the &s;ame as is intended, when it is &s;aid of Job, that <Q>he was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and e&s;chewed evil.</Q> By what has been already ob&s;erved, it appears, that Job was not &s;inle&s;sly perfect, as he <HI>cur&s;ed his day.</HI> It mu&s;t mean therefore, that he was a truly good man, a &s;incere &s;ervant of God, a real &s;aint.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame &s;en&s;e we are told, <Q>All &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for re|proof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly fini&s;hed unto all good works.</Q> This means either the &s;ame &s;incerity, to which Job attained, or a perfection of furniture, a being <HI>thoroughly furni&s;hed</HI> to all good works: and the latter clau&s;e may be under&s;tood as explanatory of the former.</P>
<P>IN this &s;en&s;e the apo&s;tle Paul, after his expre&s;s renuncia|tion of perfection, as to him&s;elf; yet a&s;&s;umes it to him&s;elf and &s;ome of his fellow Chri&s;tians; as you may &s;ee in Phil. III. 15. <Q>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwi&s;e minded, God &s;hall reveal even this unto you:</Q> plainly &s;hewing, that the apo&s;tle u&s;es the word perfection in a very different &s;en&s;e, when he a&s;&s;umes it to him&s;elf, from that in which he had u&s;ed it, when he renounced it.</P>
<P>THEREFORE when the apo&s;tle in the text exhorts us to be perfect, he exhorts as to the perfection of Job, to the integri|ty and &s;incerity of vital Chri&s;tianity: he exhorts us to live up to our profe&s;&s;ion, to live in Character, to be real and exem|plary Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>II. The apo&s;tle tells the Corinthians, to be of good com|fort.&mdash;Good comfort naturally follows from the perfection before de&s;cribed. If we be real Chri&s;tians, humble penitents and cordial believers in Chri&s;t: If we live in character, and make proper proficiency in our Chri&s;tian cour&s;e, leading an exemplary life, &s;o as to adorn the doctrine of God our Savi|our; no doubt we &s;hall enjoy comforts.&mdash;There is peace and comfort in the very exerci&s;e of Chri&s;tian grace. The carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God, not &s;ubject to his law, neither indeed can be. Therefore &s;o long as we are in our native &s;tate of depravity, we are in a &s;tate of warfare and oppo&s;ition to God. The carnal or native mind of man is oppo&s;ition it|&s;elf to God: and &s;uch a temper of mind is directly oppo&s;ed to peace and comfort. I&s;ai, LVII. 20, 21. <Q>The wicked are like the troubled &s;ea, when it cannot re&s;t, who&s;e waters
<PB N="6" REF="035438_0006_1004C87E8DA04BE8">
ca&s;t up mire and dirt. There is no peace, &s;aith my God, to the wicked.</Q> But no &s;ooner is the heart changed by divine grace, than in&s;tead of enmity, reconciliation, &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, and cordial and &s;upreme love to God are introduced and e&s;tabli&s;hed in it. Of cour&s;e then it enjoys peace and comfort. Cordial &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and reconciliation are in their very nature placid, peaceful and comfortable.</P>
<P>AND as peace and comfort are implied in the fir&s;t ex|erci&s;es of the new convert; &s;o they increa&s;e as he increa&s;es in grace. The very knowledge of God, of his law and of divine truth, affords him delight and comfort, and the more his knowledge is increa&s;ed, the more are his delight and comfort, increa&s;ed. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of his increa&s;e in humility, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to God, complacency in him, faith in Chri&s;t, and every other grace. The very exi&s;tence of &s;anctification in any per&s;on, and e&s;pecially as it will produce good fruit both in heart and life, is attended with comfort and happine&s;s. <Q>The ways of wi&s;dom are, in their own nature, ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her paths peace.</Q></P>
<P>BESIDES this, &s;anctification is the evidence of our ju&s;tifica|tion, and in this view is attended with additional comfort. You are not to imagine, my brethren, that you are to obtain evidence of your pardon and ju&s;tification, by any immediate revelation from heaven, by any &s;ugge&s;tion thrown into your mind, that you are pardoned and accepted by God; or by any text of &s;cripture brought to your thoughts however &s;ud|denly, unexpectedly &amp; unde&s;ignedly by your&s;elves. All &s;uch grounds of comfort and belief that you are pardoned, are de|lu&s;ive. The word of God gives not the lea&s;t warrant to tru&s;t to &s;uch grounds of comfort. Where in all the &s;cripture, do you find it &s;aid, that they who have an involuntary &s;ugge&s;tion, that they are converted &amp; pardoned, are in reality converted &amp; pardoned. Where do you find it &s;aid, He that has a text of &s;crip|ture unexpectedly coming to his mind, importing that his &s;ins are forgiven, is really forgiven of God?&mdash;The &s;criptural eviden|ces of conver&s;ion &amp; forgivene&s;s, are &s;uch as the&s;e; "He that believeth &amp; is "baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved;" "repent ye therefore and be "converted, that your &s;ins may be blotted out;" <Q>I love them that love me, &amp; tho&s;e that &s;eek me early &s;hall find me;</Q> <Q>Hope maketh not a&s;hamed becau&s;e the love of God is &s;hed abroad in our hearts;</Q> <Q>We know that we have pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life, becau&s;e we love the brethren;</Q> <Q>If ye continue in my word, then are ye my di&s;ciples indeed;</Q> <Q>Ye are my friends, if ye do what|&s;oever I have commanded you.</Q>&mdash;The&s;e evidences imply
<PB N="7" REF="035438_0007_1004C8801AA90320">
&s;anctification of heart and life: and to depend on any thing el&s;e, than what implies &s;anctification as an evidence of our ju&s;tification, is unwarrantable and delu&s;ive.</P>
<P>I HAVE in&s;i&s;ted the more particularly on this, becau&s;e it has plea&s;ed the great head of the church graciou&s;ly to vi&s;it you with the effu&s;ions of his holy &s;pirit, hopefully to bring &s;ome of you to the &s;aving knowledge of the truth, and to awaken and convince others: and to be informed what is the proper evidence of a real conver&s;ion, is at &s;uch a time peculiarly ne|ce&s;&s;ary. I wi&s;h you to apply what I have now &s;aid on this &s;ubject to the faithful and candid trial of your&s;elves.</P>
<P>To be perfect, then in the &s;en&s;e already de&s;cribed, affords comfort, not only as it implies a placid and peaceful temper of mind toward God, complacency in God &amp;c. but as it af|fords evidence, and the only real evidence, of our acceptance with God, and of our &s;ure title, by the promi&s;es of the go&s;|pel, to the future eternal inheritance of heaven and glory.</P>
<P>THIS mu&s;t certainly be a great &s;ource of comfort to every Chri&s;tian. Thus he enjoys peace with God through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. On his part he is at peace with God, as by regeneration, his heart is reconciled to God and &s;ubjected to his will: and God on his part is at peace with him, as for Chri&s;ts &s;ake he is reconciled to him, pardons his &s;ins adopts him and makes him an heir of him&s;elf.&mdash;What a &s;ource of comfort mu&s;t the&s;e things be to the real Chri&s;tian!</P>
<P>BESIDES, in this way he enjoys peace of con&s;cience. Ju&s;t &s;o far as a man is &s;anctified, &s;in, the very foundation of the accu&s;ations of an angry con&s;cience, is prevented or removed: and to be &s;ure in con&s;equence of &s;anctification, the foundation of accu&s;ing and condemning him&s;elf as an enemy to God, a rejecter of Chri&s;t and an unconverted &s;inner, is removed: Therefore in the &s;ame re&s;pects, he has a foundation to enjoy peace of con&s;cience and comfort in his own mind.</P>
<P>NOR is this all: the true Chri&s;tian is comforted by all the promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, that Chri&s;t will never leave nor for|&s;ake any of his real di&s;ciples; that he will be with them al|ways, that he will &s;o defend them that none &s;hall be able to pluck them out of his hand; that he will &s;upport and protect his church even to the end of the world, &s;o that the gates of hell &s;hall not be able to prevail again&s;t it; that he will increa&s;e and promote true religion in the world; that Satan's kingdom &s;hall be over thrown, that Chri&s;t &s;hall generally reign on the earth and the greatne&s;s of the kingdom under the whole hea|ven, &s;hall be given to the people of the &s;aints of the mo&s;t high God, that the whole earth &s;hall be full of the knowledge of
<PB N="8" REF="035438_0008_1004C88214574A68">
the Lord as the waters cover the &s;eas; and that finally the kingdom of grace, which took its original from heaven, &s;hall be tran&s;planted to heaven, its native &s;oil, and &s;hall, there eter|nally flouri&s;h in perfect re&s;t, peace, holine&s;s, and happine&s;s, to the glory of God the Father.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e con&s;iderations are replete with comfort to real Chri&s;tians. No wonder then they are exhorted to be of good comfort. They have rea&s;on of comfort, under the greate&s;t afflictions and per&s;ecutions, that ever they are called to en|dure.</P>
<P>III. THE apo&s;tle exhorts the Corinthians to be of one mind.&mdash;This is of great importance in every community, and e&s;|pecially in every Chri&s;tian church or &s;ociety.&mdash;They ought to be of one mind in &s;everal re&s;pects.</P>
<P>I. As to their articles of faith.&mdash;Articles of faith, or at be&s;t articles of infidelity will naturally govern the temper and practice. He who believes there is no God, will not love and wor&s;hip him. He who believes that Chri&s;t is not the Saviour, will not tru&s;t in him for &s;alvation. He who be|lives not in a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, will not prepare for it. He who believes not the go&s;pel to be true, will not be anxious to comply with it. He who believes that there is nothing in religion, will not embrace, love and practi&s;e it. If then any people be not of one mind in the&s;e re&s;pects, how can they walk together?</P>
<P>OR if they differ in things on which the very exi&s;tence of all religion does not depend; &s;till even this diver&s;ity of &s;enti|ment produces di&s;cord and is very hurtful. For in&s;tance, if &s;ome believe the total depravaty of human nature, but others believe that we naturally have &s;ome good principles in us: If &s;ome believe the &s;overeignty of divine grace, that God has a right to ca&s;t off all men &amp; would do them no injury, if he &s;hould make them eternally mi&s;erable; while others believe either that no man de&s;erves eternal mi&s;ery, or that tho&s;e who are moral &amp; attend on the means of grace, ought not to be finally rejected: If &s;ome believe the entire and total dependance of man upon God, and his grace; while others think we haven <HI>&s;elf-determing power</HI> in our wills, which is entirely &s;ufficient for repentance and all the exerci&s;es of religion: If &s;ome believe the great importance, u&s;efulne&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity of public wor&s;hip on the &s;abbath; while others think they can &s;pend the &s;abbath as profitably at their own homes: If &s;ome believe the nece&s;&s;ity and indi&s;pen&s;able obligation of a virtuous and pious education of their children while others are im|pre&s;&s;ed with no &s;uch ideas: If &s;ome believe them&s;elves bound
<PB N="9" REF="035438_0009_1004C8868329FF60">
to &s;ubmit cheerfully to the expence nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport both the public wor&s;hip of the &s;abbath, and the &s;chools nece&s;&s;ary for the due education of their children, but others grudge every part of this expence: you cannot but &s;ee, that this diver&s;ity of &s;entiment mu&s;t work di&s;order and confu&s;ion, and finally, tend to the ruin of any &s;ociety.</P>
<P>II. THEY ought to be of one mind in their aims &amp; ends.&mdash;What if &s;ome aim at the glory of God, others at their own glory and applau&s;e? What if &s;ome aim at the promotion of true religion and the intere&s;t of Chri&s;t, and others, at the promotion of their own intere&s;t merely? What if &s;ome are willing to deny them&s;elves and their own intere&s;t or applau&s;e, for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t and his cau&s;e, but others &s;et up them|&s;elves as &s;upreme, and make religion it&s;elf &s;ub&s;ervient to their private ends? It is manife&s;t, that the religious concerns of &s;uch a people cannot proceed with &s;ucce&s;s. As &s;oon as ever religion proves not to be &s;ub&s;ervient to their applau&s;e, their ambition or their private ends, a part of them for&s;ake and oppo&s;e it; they oppo&s;e therewith, oppo&s;e Chri&s;tianity and oppo&s;e Chri&s;t him&s;elf. And how can we expect any good to the cau&s;e of religion and virtue, in &s;uch a cour&s;e of things as this?&mdash;This &s;hows the nece&s;&s;ity of being of one mind.</P>
<P>III. It is equally nece&s;&s;ary that a people be united in their <HI>mea&s;ures</HI> to &s;upport or promote religion&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e all the in|dividuals of any community are agreed to aim at the divine glory and the advancement of virtue and piety; yet if they pur&s;ue different paths and take different mea&s;ures, to &s;ecure the&s;e ends; if one be of Paul, and another of Apollos; if while all are wi&s;hing to &s;ettle a mini&s;ter, one choo&s;e to &s;et|tle this man and another that, and each be fixed in his own mea&s;ures; what can be done in this ca&s;e? The great end will doubtle&s;s be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e things there mu&s;t be mutual conde&s;cen&s;ion; and hereby in the ca&s;e now de&s;cribed there can be conde&s;cen&s;ion. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, that all are &s;eeking the &s;ame end: and when the generality are agreed in the mea&s;ures to &s;ecure this end; for in&s;tance the &s;ettlement of a particular mini&s;ter; and wi&s;e men in the &s;ociety and out of it, judge it be&s;t for the &s;ociety, that he &s;hould be &s;ettled; hereby in this ca&s;e one or two in|dividuals &s;hould rather conde&s;cend and fall in with the wi&s;hes of the &s;ociety in general, than that the &s;ociety &s;hould &s;ubmit to them, or be broken in pieces. Unle&s;s there be conde&s;cen|&s;ion in &s;ome &s;uch ca&s;es, no people can enjoy peace and &s;ucce&s;s in their religious concerns.</P>

IV. THE apo&s;tle exhorts the Corinthians to <HI>live in peace.</HI>&mdash;Peace follows of cour&s;e from what the apo&s;tle had before enjoined. There is no danger, that they who agree in the articles of their faith and religious &s;entiments, in their aims and ends, and in their mea&s;ures to obtain tho&s;e ends; will fall into contention concerning religion. And how happy is re|ligious peace! How comfortable to the church and &s;ociety! How comfortable to their mini&s;ter! How favorable to the advancement of the knowledge of the truth, to the love and practice of it! and to the increa&s;e of true and real religion! On the contrary, how di&s;agreeable is it to live in contention! How uncomfortable to the church, to the &s;ociety and to the mini&s;ter! How unfavourable to the increa&s;e of religious knowledge, virtue and piety! It is directly op|po&s;ed to both morality and piety, and cannot proceed from them, but from the want of them; or rather from that which is directly oppo&s;ed to them. <Q>Whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even from your lu&s;ts which war again&s;t the &s;pirit?</Q></P>
<P>BUT however uncomfortable and hurtful contention is, we may expect it, unle&s;s we be of one mind in the formentioned re&s;pects. If every one be &s;trenuous for his own peculiar opinions, his own ends and his own mea&s;ures, there can be no peace in any &s;ociety. And there is great danger of this from various cau&s;es.&mdash;One &s;ource of danger is the natural liberty and independence of man. As every ble&s;&s;ing and privilege is capable of abu&s;e, &s;o this is true with regard to per&s;onal liberty. As men feel them&s;elves free and in many re&s;pects independent; &s;ome are apt to indulge this indepen|dence in adopting peculiar opinions, and in pur&s;uing peculiar ends and peculiar mea&s;ures. Some from vanity effect &s;ingu|larity. They wi&s;h to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, and they can|not do it any other way &s;o ea&s;ily as by &s;etting up for peculiar opinions, ends or mea&s;ures. Thus they effect to &s;how them|&s;elves wi&s;er than other men&mdash;The head of a party is always di&s;tingui&s;hed, and to be in &s;uch a &s;ituation is flattering to human vanity. From this motive &s;ome put them&s;elves at the head of a party however erroneous: and to gratify their ambition, they will rend the &s;ociety to which they belong, in pieces, and de&s;troy all peace, all order, and all good.</P>
<P>V. On certain conditions, the apo&s;tle promi&s;es the Corin|thians, that the God of love and peace would be with them. The conditions are, that they be perfect, of good comfort, of one mind, and that they live in peace.&mdash;And if we comply with the&s;e conditions, God will be with us in &s;everal re&s;pects.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="035438_0011_1004C88A8FA562E8">
I. He will be with us by the pre&s;ence of his grace in our hearts. All who comply with tho&s;e conditions, are truly gracious per&s;ons, are the &s;ubject of divine grace communicat|ed in &s;anctification, by the holy &s;pirit of God, and God by his grace and Holy Spirit habitually dwells in them. In this re&s;pect he never leaves them nor for&s;akes them, but is with them to the end of their lives.</P>
<P>II. If we comply with the forementioned conditions, God will be with us, in the way of divine con&s;olation. This is the natural con&s;equence of the former particular. It is im|plied in what has been already &s;aid, that divine grace is com|forting in its very nature, as it implies love to God, to the law of God, and to our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; as it implies faith, truth and hope in Chri&s;t, and as it implies love to mankind; all which are agreeable, plea&s;ant and comforting emotions; That it is comforting, as it implies the &s;ubduing of native de|pravity, which is ever turbulent and oppo&s;ed to peace and comfort; and as it gives evidence of future grace and &s;up|port here, and of eternal glory hereafter.</P>
<P>III. ON the &s;ame conditions God will be with us in the way of protection. He will keep us even as the apple of his eye: he will never leave us nor for&s;ake us, and never de|liver us up into the hands of our &s;piritual foes, who &s;eek our ruin. As he really is, &s;o he will act as the captain of our &s;alvation, and afford us the mo&s;t effectual aid, in times of need. Nay, he will make all things to work together for our good; for this is his expre&s;s promi&s;e to them that love God. And tho' we may fall into various temporal evils, from the&s;e we &s;hall be recovered, and tho&s;e evils them&s;elves &s;hall be made to work together for our good.</P>
<P>IV. GOD will be with us to build us up in faith and holi|ne&s;s. <Q>The path of the ju&s;t is as the &s;hining light, which &s;hineth more and more unto the perfect day.</Q> We need the &s;ame communications of grace to build us up in holine&s;s, as in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to regenerate our hearts: and this we &s;hall receive on the conditions &s;pecified in the text.</P>
<P>V. GOD will be with us, to prepare us for glory and to receive us to it. He will never &s;uffer any who are once the &s;ubjects of grace, to fail of glory. <Q>Whom he did fore know, he al&s;o did prede&s;tinate to be conformed to the image of his Son; &amp; whom he did prede&s;tinate, them he al&s;o call|ed; and whom he called, them he al&s;o ju&s;tified; and whom he ju&s;tified, them he al&s;o glorified.</Q> <Q>Who &s;hall &s;eparate us from the love of Chri&s;t? Shall tribulation, or di&s;tre&s;s, or per&s;ecution, or famine, or nakedne&s;s, or peril, or fraud?
<PB N="12" REF="035438_0012_1004C88D3305DFD8">
Nay in all the&s;e things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us. For I am per&s;uaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things pre&s;ent, nor things to come, not height, nor depth, nor any other creature, &s;hall be able to &s;eparate us from the love of God, which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord.</Q></P>
<P>I SHALL now apply the&s;e general ob&s;ervations to the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion.&mdash;For &s;everal years pa&s;t, I have been with you labouring in the mini&s;try, endeavouring to in&s;truct you in the great and mo&s;t important doctrines of the go&s;pel, to in|culcate the duties, to excite you to the practice of it, and to warn you again&s;t every error, &s;in and vice. My connec|tion with you has been peaceful, agreeable, &amp; of late I hope &s;ucce&s;sful. I expected to continue &amp; &s;pend the re&s;t of my days with you. And as the propo&s;al of my leaving you was no ob|ject of my &s;eeking; &s;o it has been attended with great anxiety concerning my duty. As the be&s;t expedient in the ca&s;e, and the mo&s;t likely means of obtaining light as to my duty, the whole que&s;tion concerning my removal has, as you well know, been &s;ubmitted to a council mutually agreeable to us both. You know the re&s;ult of the council; it was their un|animous opinion, that it was my duty to accept the call, which invites me to leave you, and your duty to acquie&s;ce.</P>
<P>HAD they decided, that I ought to continue with you, I &s;hould have complied with their deci&s;ion, in a conviction, that in that ca&s;e I &s;hould enjoy for more ea&s;e; more lei&s;ure, more retirement and more opportunity to pro&s;ecute my favourite &s;tudy of theology, to indulge many agreeable propen&s;ities and to enjoy many of my mo&s;t agreeable friends, who&s;e &s;ociety mu&s;t be lo&s;t by my removal. And now that they have decided it to be my duty to accept a call to a di&s;tant place, I feel my&s;elf obligated to comply with their deci&s;ion, tho' with great re|luctance to leaving this dear people, e&s;pecially at the pre&s;ent juncture, at which it has plea&s;ed the great head of the church to afford his influences among us; and in the pro&s;pect of la|bour, anxiety, re&s;pon&s;ibility and perhaps difficulty, in the undertaking to which I am invited. Yet &s;ince it is by pro|per judges decided to be my duty, I &s;hall take upon me this arduous &s;ervice, and di&s;charge the obligations of it, according to my be&s;t ability, looking to God to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport me.</P>
<P>SINCE we mu&s;t part, what is more proper, than we part as Paul, and the Corinthians did? After the example of the great apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, I do certainly mo&s;t ardently wi&s;h you to be perfect, to be of good comfort, to be of one mind and to live in peace; and that you may be animated &s;o
<PB N="13" REF="035438_0013_1004C890A823E8D0">
to do, by the motive, that then the God of love and peace &s;hall be with you.</P>
<P>You have heard what has been &s;aid concerning the nece&s;&s;i|ty of unanimity and peace among your&s;elves. And I dare &s;ay you realize it. Formerly, you experienced the ill effects of di&s;&s;entions. Let this your experience warn and guard you again&s;t every thing of the like kind in future. <Q>Remem|bering your affliction and your mi&s;ery, the worm wood and the gall; let your &s;oul &s;till have them in remembrance, and be humbled in you.</Q> Let me be&s;eech you to with&s;tand the beginning of di&s;&s;ention. It is <Q>like the letting out of water; once let out, it is hard to be &s;topped again, and the longer it runs, the deeper and wider channel it wears, Therefore leave off contention before it is meddled with.</Q></P>
<P>YOUR union among your&s;elves, as well as your kind treat|ment of me, &s;ince I have been connected with you, has been a &s;ource of happine&s;s to me. I &s;hall always remember you with affection, gratitude and kinde&s;t benevolence. It is a mo&s;t happy circum&s;tance, that &s;ince we mu&s;t part, we part not only with peace, but with entire mutual friend&s;hip. This is a &s;ingular ca&s;e of the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of a mini&s;ter from his peo|ple. That you have acted in this whole affair with &s;o much candour, with &s;o many and &s;o unequivocal te&s;timonies of af|fection to me, and regard to the council which has di&s;&s;olved our connection, has been often noticed to your honor. I hope the mutual friend&s;hip, which has uninterruptedly &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between us, will ever continue, and that we &s;hall &s;in|cerely remember each other in our prayers.</P>
<P>As your mini&s;ter is now about to leave you, I &s;incerely pray and hope that in due time God will &s;end you a good mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t a man full of faith and of the Holy Gho&s;t; and that under his faithful mini&s;try much people may be added unto the Lord. And as it has plea&s;ed God lately to vi&s;it you with the influences of his Holy &s;pirit, to the revival of true religion among you; I pre&s;ume you will not be contented to live long, without &s;o important a ble&s;&s;ing, as a Chri&s;tian mini&s;ter. If you have ta&s;ted, that the Lord is gracious, you will not be willing to live without the preach|ing of the go&s;pel and &s;tated wor&s;hip on the &s;abbath. As new born babes you will de&s;ire the &s;incere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</P>
<P>I HOPE, Brethren, that in &s;ettling a mini&s;ter, you will be attentive to two things, that he be found in the faith, &amp; that as far as you can judge, he be a man of true piety. If he be not found in the faith, he will lead you &amp; your children into
<PB N="14" REF="035438_0014_1004C89231E963B8">
error and fal&s;e religion: and this error and fal&s;e religion will naturally de&s;cend to future generations, and may prove fatal to thou&s;ands.&mdash;And if he be not a man of true piety, with what &s;incerity can he act in any part of his mini&s;try? As he will not be friendly to Chri&s;t or his cau&s;e, he will not re|li&s;h the truth, nor heartily engage to promote it. If he do not directly oppo&s;e true religion, which is the mo&s;t favour|able &s;uppo&s;ition; &s;till being a blind leader of the blind, he &amp; his hearers will likely both fall into the ditch.</P>
<P>BUT if you &s;hall &s;ettle a good and faithful mini&s;ter, you will, &s;o far as you your&s;elves are rightly di&s;po&s;ed, rejoice in him and in his mini&s;trations; you will have peace and be e|dified in the mo&s;t holy faith; and you will have rea&s;on to hope, that God will ble&s;s his labours among you, and extend the good effects of &s;uch a mini&s;try to generations yet unborn.</P>
<P>How happy will you be under &s;uch a mini&s;ter! How hap|py will all your friends be on your behalf! And how happy &s;hall I be, to hear of your pro&s;perity!</P>
<P>AND now, Brethren, I am to take my leave of you. When Paul took leave of the elders of the church of Epha&s;us, <Q>they all wept &s;ore, and fell on Pauls neck and ki&s;&s;ed him, &s;or|rowing mo&s;t of all for the words, which&punc; he &s;pake, that <HI>they &s;hould &s;ee his face no more.</HI></Q> How it may be with us, brethren, whether we may ever be permitted to &s;ee each others face again in this world, God only knows. Therefore <Q>final|ly, brethren, farewell.</Q> It is my hearts de&s;ire and prayer for you, that you may pro&s;per in all your real intere&s;ts; that you may pro&s;per in your &s;everal lawful &s;ecular concerns; that you may pro&s;per as a &s;ociety, increa&s;ing in numbers, wealth and reputation, and be regarded as a truly re&s;pectable people, by all around you.&mdash;That you may be pro&s;pered as a church, e&s;tabli&s;hed in the faith and order of the go&s;pel, re|ceiving "daily additions of &s;uch as &s;hall be &s;aved."&mdash;And that you may pro&s;per as individuals that every carele&s;s &s;in|ner among you may be thoroughly awakened and convinced; that every unregenerate &s;inner may be renewed by divine grace: and that every real Chri&s;tian may <Q>grow in grace &amp; in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q>&mdash;In one word, that your &s;ouls may be in health and pro&s;|per".</P>
<P>To this end, let me be&s;eech you all to improve the pre&s;ent favourable opportunity. Now God is &s;hedding down his kind influences among you, to the awakening and conviction of many and the hopeful conver&s;ion of &s;ome. Now then is an happy opportunity to obtain the grace of God. <Q>Now
<PB N="15" REF="035438_0015_1004C893C6536A50">
is the accepted time; now is the day of &s;alvation.</Q> Should any of you live through &s;uch a time as this, and re&s;i&s;t the peculiar and &s;trong motives, which are now exhibited, to be|come reconciled to God; it is not likely, that the weaker mo|tives of ordinary times will have much effect upon you. But you are in the hands of a &s;overeign God, to whom you have forfeited every ble&s;&s;ing, and who therefore has a right to have mercy upon you, or to leave you to peri&s;h in your &s;ins. You are dependent on his &s;overeign grace. Own this your de|pendence; and expect help from no other &s;ource. Accept the offered grace of God, and lo&s;e not that infinite ble&s;&s;ing, by neglect or delay.</P>
<P><Q>TAKE heed to your&s;elves, and to all the flock, which God hath purcha&s;ed with his own blood.</Q> Take heed, <Q>that after my departing grievous wolves do not enter in a|mong you, not &s;paring the flock; and that of your own|&s;elves men do not ari&s;e, &s;peaking prever&s;e things, to draw away di&s;ciples after them.</Q>&mdash;<Q>Brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them, which are &s;anctified.</Q> May the God of love and peace be with and ble&s;s both you and me re&s;pectively; may he watch over, protect and pro&s;per us in our &s;everal lawful ways; and may he e&s;pecially repleni&s;h our hearts with his grace &amp; love. And when we &s;hall have &s;erved our generation according to his will; may we meet with joy and mutual congratulation before our common judge, be acquitted and accepted by him, and &s;o may we be forever with the Lord.</P>
