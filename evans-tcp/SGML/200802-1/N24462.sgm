<BIBL>1 TIMOTHY iv.8.</BIBL>
<Q>&mdash;GODLINESS is profitable unto all things, having prom|i&s;e of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN all &s;ituations and conditions of life, true reli|gion is of the fir&s;t importance. It is the &s;olace of tho&s;e, who are placed in the vale of poverty and affliction; the &s;weetener of all the unambitious en|joyments, of the middle walks of private life; and the highe&s;t ornament to the per&s;ons, and characters of the rich, the honorable, and the great. Without it, no man can be either truly, or la&s;tingly happy. Were this divine gue&s;t to be bani&s;hed from the &s;o|ciety of men, this world would become but the a|bode of folly and wretchedne&s;s; and man, with all his boa&s;ted rea&s;on and &s;uperiority, inferior, in point of real enjoyment, to the herds who graze the fields.</P>
<P>THE &s;entiments of St. Paul on this &s;ubject, are clearly expre&s;&s;ed in our text and context. After cautioning Timothy to avoid perplexing him&s;elf and
<PB N="6" REF="032377_0005_0FF2033B5616B190">
others, with the fabulous traditions of the Jews, and their endle&s;s genealogies, and exhorting him, like the athleticks in the Grecian games, to exert his utter|mo&s;t labor and diligence, in pur&s;uing and promoting the doctrines and duties of true piety, as an argu|ment to enforce the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hole he introduces the words of our text. <HI>Godline&s;s is profitable unto all things, ha|ving promi&s;e of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</HI></P>
<P>THESE motives to godline&s;s, though fir&s;t addre&s;&s;|ed to Timothy, apply with equal force and propri|ety to all men, of every age and condition. The import of the text is briefly <HI>this,</HI> "Godline&s;s is ev|ery way advantageous. Whoever &s;hall experience the power of it, will thence derive a rich harve&s;t of gain. Be&s;ide the crown of immortal glory, which it infallibly &s;ecures to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, it will produce the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction, of which the human mind is capable, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of exi&s;tence. Its ad|vantages are eminent in all &s;tations, and &s;ituations, and in the pro&s;ecution of every bu&s;ine&s;s, proper to engage the attention of mankind."</P>
<P>IF then godline&s;s have promi&s;es of good to be en|joyed in this life, as well as in that which is to come, if it be profitable unto <HI>all things,</HI> we may doubtle&s;s with &s;afety conclude, that effectual aid may be deri|ved from it, in the admini&s;tration of civil govern|ment; and that, if generally and faithfully prac|ti&s;ed, it would mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially contribute toward obtaining for, and &s;ecuring to a community, all the important ends of its in&s;titution.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate <HI>this ob&s;ervation,</HI> is the propo&s;ed ob|ject of the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e. Preparatory to which, a conci&s;e view of the nature of godline&s;s, and of the ends of civil government will fir&s;t be taken.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="032377_0006_0FF20361B4B6ACB8">GODLINESS is a term u&s;ed in two &s;en&s;es; the one limited, and the other more general. In its limited &s;en&s;e, it includes only the duties of piety to|ward God. In its general &s;en&s;e, it compri&s;es all the duties pre&s;cribed by the chri&s;tian religion; tho&s;e which we owe to our fellow-men, and to our&s;elves, as well as tho&s;e which we owe to God. The apo&s;|tle, in our text, u&s;es the term in its mo&s;t general &s;en&s;e, as appears from the exten&s;ive benefits, which, he a&s;&s;ures us, will flow from a faithful practice of its various duties. The&s;e duties cannot now be mi|nutely detailed. It may however be proper to ob|&s;erve in general, that they may be divided into four cla&s;&s;es, the duties we owe to God, to Chri&s;t, to our fellow-men, and to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t of the&s;e, are compri&s;ed &s;upreme love to God, a fixed dependance on, and a humble tru&s;t in him, a cordial &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his providential di&s;|pen&s;ations, together with conformity to his revealed will.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd, are included faith in the mediator, accompanied with a daily and &s;incere attention to him, con&s;idered as our teacher, our example and law|giver, our advocate and interce&s;&s;or with the father.</P>
<P>IN the third, are contained univer&s;al love to man|kind, mercy, ju&s;tice, beneficence, truth and the for|givene&s;s of injuries.</P>
<P>THE fourth, comprehends the graces of humility, meekne&s;s, prudence, fortitude and &s;elf-government.</P>
<P>ALL the before mentioned virtues are briefly com|prehended, by our divine ma&s;ter, in the following expre&s;&s;ive words. "Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thy|&s;elf" <HI>The&s;e</HI> unitedly con&s;titute that godline&s;s, which
<PB N="8" REF="032377_0007_0FF2037B05DE4DD8">is urged on us in our text, as being every way con|ducive to the advancement, of all the important in|tere&s;ts of mankind.</P>
<P>BUT in order to determine, how far godline&s;s contributes to the obtainment of the great ends of civil in&s;titutions, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to enquire what tho&s;e ends are? Or what are the great objects, all governments ought to pur&s;ue, and which all good governments actually do pur&s;ue, though with dif|ferent degrees of &s;ucce&s;s? The&s;e, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, may be all comprehended in the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE primary object of civil in&s;titutions is to prevent tho&s;e evils, which, con&s;idering the deprav|ity of mankind, would certainly re&s;ult from a &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>SELFISHNESS is the predominant principle of fal|len man. This, by being &s;upreme, nece&s;&s;arily ex|cludes the fear of God, and benevolence to our fel|low-men. And among a number of individuals, un|united by any &s;ocial compact, would produce a &s;tate of con&s;tant mutual ho&s;tility. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, jarring intere&s;ts would at once enkindle the fire, and con&s;tantly fan the flame of di&s;cord; and of cour&s;e bani&s;h peace and &s;ecurity. No protection, except what may be derived from per&s;onal prowe&s;s, can be obtained by individuals, in a &s;tate of nature. Life and property are equally in&s;ecure. Indeed without &s;ome kind of civil a&s;&s;ociation, the la&s;t mu&s;t be ex|tremely limited. The power of an individual, una&s;|&s;i&s;ted by tho&s;e arts, which flouri&s;h only under the protection of civil government, is wholly incompe|tent to the acqui&s;ition of more property, than a bare &s;ufficiency for a &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. But admitting the po&s;&s;ibility of acquiring con&s;iderable property in a &s;tate of nature, &s;till it would only &s;erve to invite plunder, and lawle&s;s inva&s;ion. The more one po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="9" REF="032377_0008_0FF20377370E7B80">the greater would be his danger. And if his &s;trength &s;hould prove &s;ufficient, to re&s;i&s;t a &s;ingle invader, it mu&s;t unavoidably yield to the &s;uperior force of a combination of tho&s;e, who would choo&s;e to live by rapine, rather than &s;ubmit to the toils of daily labor.</P>
<P>THE evils to which men would unavoidably be expo&s;ed, in a &s;tate of nature, we may learn from tho&s;e, which have ever been attendant on revolu|tions. During &s;uch changes there is ever a period, in which laws lo&s;e their influence, and licentiou&s;|ne&s;s prevails. This reign of anarchy is at its mo&s;t alarming cri&s;is, in that &s;tage of a revolution which intervenes, between the de&s;truction of the old, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of new principles and maxims of government. It is probable that no revolution was ever effected in any country, with le&s;s of the&s;e evils, than the recent one here in America. In our own State, very few di&s;orders appeared; owing perhaps principally to the incon&s;iderable alterations, which the revolution produced. But in &s;ome parts of the union, the mo&s;t fatal evils were experienced. Law was no longer a re&s;traint, right no longer regarded, property was invaded, virtue in&s;ulted, cha&s;tity pol|luted, and life &s;acrificed, by abandoned ruffians, who, having broken over every re&s;traint, rioted on the &s;poils of their innocent neighbours. Under an in|expre&s;&s;ibly more dreadful experience of the&s;e, and many other &s;imilar evils, it is well known, one of the principal kingdoms of Europe, has for &s;everal years been groaning.</P>
<P>THESE things have been mentioned, &s;olely with a view of exhibiting a &s;pecimen of what may be expected from a &s;tate of nature. To prevent their exi&s;tence, as far as po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ecure to individuals the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of life, liberty and property,
<PB N="10" REF="032377_0009_0FF1D5E06147ED90">is a primary object of civil government. And its tendency to accompli&s;h this purpo&s;e, undoubtedly wrought a coviction of its ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, in the minds of men, in the early ages of the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER object worthy of the pur&s;uit of government, is the promotion of the greate&s;t good of the whole community, &s;o far as that may be ef|fected, without injury done to others.</P>
<P>PRIVATE intere&s;t, or the good of an individual, farther than it may be con&s;idered as involved in the good of the whole, ought not to be, and cannot con&s;i&s;tently be the object of the &s;ocial compact. As the whole is greater than its parts, &s;o the good of a community is greater than the private intere&s;t of any individual. And to cau&s;e a greater intere&s;t to &s;uf|fer, for the purpo&s;e of advancing a le&s;s, is a violation of the order of nature, and of the laws of equity and rea&s;on. A community is but one great family; in which, every member ought to consider his own in|terest, as involved in that of the whole; and this whole ought to &s;wallow up every private or detach|ed intere&s;t. As no private family can be happy, where each member is actuated &s;olely by a princi|ple of &s;elf-gratification; as &s;uch a line of conduct will produce a con&s;tant cla&s;hing of intere&s;ts, which will unavoidably i&s;&s;ue in contention and animo&s;ity; &s;o no &s;tate can enjoy political happine&s;s, where the public good is neglected, and an attachment to pri|vate, becomes the ruling pa&s;&s;ion. Hence cabals are always injurious, and ought to be oppo&s;ed and even de&s;pi&s;ed, as de&s;tructive of the great ends of civil &s;o|ciety. They invariably have for their object, &s;ome party de&s;ign. And the &s;etting up of &s;uch an inte|re&s;t as the principal object of pur&s;uit, is in the na|ture of it, ho&s;tile to public good. Private emolu|ment cannot be &s;et in competition with public, with|out endangering the latter. And to endanger the
<PB N="11" REF="032377_0010_0FF2033D189AB8A8">public good, for any private advantage, is always to &s;acrifice the greater intere&s;t to the le&s;s.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e ob&s;ervations it appears, that the good which ought to be the object of government is the public good; and that in competition with it, no private or party intere&s;t ought ever to be placed.</P>
<P>BUT it is further to be ob&s;erved, that although the greate&s;t good of a community, ought to be the leading object of its government, yet even <HI>this</HI> is not to be pur&s;ued, by &s;uch mea&s;ures as are injuri|ous to other communities. Although the intere&s;t of an individual may be &s;acrificed, where it is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to promote the greate&s;t good of the public, of which he is a member; yet it by no means follows, that a &s;tate or kingdom, in order to pro|mote its own advantage, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a right to adopt &s;uch mea&s;ures, as are injurious to a &s;i&s;ter &s;tate. It is as incon&s;i&s;tent with every rule of moral obliga|tion, for one &s;tate to commit inju&s;tice again&s;t anoth|er, as it is for an individual to rob or plunder his neighbour. All mankind are brethren, the chil|dren of the &s;ame common parent. Different &s;tates are correlatives of each other. The great chri&s;tian law which pre&s;cribes our duty toward our neigh|bours, con&s;idered in our individual capacity, will, if ob&s;erved, regulate the conduct of &s;tates toward each other.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH politicians have burdened the &s;cience of government, with many intricacies, which may, not improperly, be called the chicanery of courts; yet, if inexperience may be permitted to ri&s;k an o|pinion, we &s;hould &s;ay that it is reducible to a few plain principles. To love our neighbour as our|&s;elves&mdash;To do to others as we would that they &s;hould do to us, are rules of moral conduct as appli|cable to communities, as to individuals. Nor can
<PB N="12" REF="032377_0011_0FF2031CB1E861E8">any rea&s;on be a&s;&s;igned in ju&s;tification of fraud, in|ju&s;tice, oppre&s;&s;ion, or cruelty in a body of men, more than in a &s;ingle per&s;on. On the contrary, where a body of men practi&s;e inju&s;tice, the crime is far greater, than a &s;imilar act of inju&s;tice performed by an individual: becau&s;e in the one ca&s;e, the guilt is confined to a &s;ingle &s;ubject, and in the other, it extends to a whole community; and becau&s;e the evil con&s;equences of public inju&s;tice, and the inju|ries done by it, are far more exten&s;ive, than tho&s;e of private. When one nation is guilty of inju&s;tice towards another, thou&s;ands and millions may feel the injury. It is not in human power to calculate the evils, which will follow one deliberate act of &s;uch inju&s;tice. It will be readily granted, that the evils of private inju&s;tice are many. Among the&s;e may be enumerated expen&s;ive law-&s;uits, the di&s;affection of families to each other, and all the u&s;ual con&s;equences of private hatred. Yet admitting the wor&s;t that can follow, the civil law is a barrier, which will al|ways check and re&s;train the&s;e evils, and confine them within certain limits. But when one nation practi&s;es gro&s;s inju&s;tice again&s;t another, there is no common arbiter, either to decide the contention, or to control its de&s;tructive effects. War commonly bur&s;ts forth like a &s;weeping deluge, overwhelming and confounding the innocent with the guilty; and inflicting on whole countries greater, and more du|rable calamities, than any of the u&s;ual &s;courges, by which heaven corrects the madne&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P>THE foregoing ob&s;ervations &s;ufficiently prove, that national inju&s;tice is far more criminal in it&s;elf, and far more fatal in its con&s;equences, than private. And of con&s;equence, that the &s;ame moral rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the &s;criptures have pre&s;cribed to individuals, and by which they are bound to reg|ulate their conduct, ought to be adopted by nations, and faithfully adhered to, in all their treatment of
<PB N="13" REF="032377_0012_0FF2037EA1425BC8">each other. Hence will appear the ju&s;tice of the remark before made, that although the greate&s;t public good of a community, ought to be the end of its government, yet even that object, great and important as it is, ought never to be pur&s;ued, by means, which involve in them, a violation of the rights of other nations.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding the evident truth of this remark, it is to be lamented, that a policy directly repugnant to the rules of moral ju&s;tice, has been too prevalent among all nations. The Roman love of their country, &s;o much the boa&s;t of her citizens and &s;o highly celebrated by her be&s;t writers, even in the pure&s;t days of that republic, was but a &s;elfi&s;h con|tracted principle. Its object was the aggrandize|ment of their commonwealth, not only without any regard to the happine&s;s of other nations, but at the expen&s;e of their liberties, privileges and independ|ence. Their love of their country, led them to de&s;troy, or at lea&s;t to &s;ubjugate every neighbouring &s;tate, which &s;tood in the way of the enlargement of their empire, or who&s;e intere&s;t was incon&s;i&s;tent with their own ambitious views. Ju&s;tly were they char|acterized by the &s;pirit of prophe&s;y as <HI>a bea&s;t dread|ful and terrible, and &s;trong exceedingly; as devouring and breaking in pieces, and &s;tamping the re&s;idue with their feet.</HI></P>
<P>IT is with the deepe&s;t regret, that truth obliges us to confe&s;s, that too &s;imilar to this dete&s;table exam|ple, has been the policy of modern, as well as an|cient nations. While the rulers of kingdoms have been careful to inculcate mutual ju&s;tice among their &s;ubjects, by wi&s;e and &s;alutary laws, they appear to have forgotten that national ju&s;tice is a virtue; or not to be &s;en&s;ible, that there is any thing criminal in injuring a neighbouring &s;tate, where the power of doing it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and an opportunity offered.
<PB N="14" REF="032377_0013_0FF20322B6073CE0">While the private robber, who forces from an indi|vidual a &s;mall &s;um, mu&s;t expiate his crime on a gibbet, it has been but too common for one nation to rob another of whole provinces, not only without cen&s;ure, but with a tribute of prai&s;e for their mar|tialy atchievments. To this fatal &s;ource, the inju&s;|tice of nations toward each other, is to be attri|buted the awful &s;courge of war, with all its dread|ful calamities. If the cau&s;e could once be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, the effect would cea&s;e; and the prophecy of univer&s;al peace, &s;o frequently repeated in the &s;acred writings, meet with an immediate accompli&s;hment. The in&s;truments of war would then be converted into implements of hu&s;bandry; nation would not lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, nor would they learn war any more.</P>
<P>THESE few remarks on national inju&s;tice have been made, to call to the minds of this audience, the evils, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from the prevalency of that unju&s;t policy, which leads a nation to advance her own intere&s;t, by acts of inju&s;tice done to others. And likewi&s;e for the purpo&s;e of explaining in what &s;en&s;e, the public good ought to be the object of political in&s;titutions. To avoid the evils of a &s;tate of nature, and to promote the greate&s;t national happine&s;s, have been mentioned as the proper ends of government. The&s;e, are con&s;idered as including not only the particular ob|jects, which have been brought up to view in what has been &s;aid, but whatever tends to the pro&s;perity of a nation.</P>
<P>WE will now proceed to enquire, what advan|tages, in the pur&s;uit of the&s;e ends, may be derived from the practice of godline&s;s.</P>
<P N="1">1. GODLINESS will be productive of national fe|licity, by &s;ecuring the fidelity of rulers.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="032377_0014_0FF20328751858A0">THAT national happine&s;s and mi&s;ery, are clo&s;ely connected with the character and conduct of tho&s;e who hold the reins of government, approaches nigh to a &s;elf-evident propo&s;ition. At lea&s;t it is a truth which a very little argumentation will &s;upport, and which has been fully confirmed by all hi&s;tory, both &s;acred and profane. The government of an Ahab, and a Mana&s;&s;eh, of a Nero and a Caligula, afford unequivocal proofs of the mi&s;ery of a people, de&s;tined to endure the &s;courge of wicked and tyran|ical rulers. "When the righteous are in author|ity, the people rejoice, but when the wicked bear|eth rule, the people mourn." An unprincipled magi&s;trate is regardle&s;s of the public good, and wholly under the influence of &s;elfi&s;h and mercenary views. In &s;uch hands neither the property, the lib|erty nor the life of the people are &s;ecure. <HI>The&s;e</HI> may, and mo&s;t probably often will be &s;acrificed to the lu&s;t, the ambition, the avarice, and even the ca|price of the tyrant. The public good is un&s;peak|ably too precious a depo&s;ite, to be betru&s;ted to &s;uch men. He who di&s;regards the obligations he is under to his God, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uitably to feel tho&s;e which he is under to his fellow men. He will rather be led to con&s;ider his exaltation to office, as rai|&s;ing him above the re&s;traints, laid upon his unofficed brethren, and as affording him an opportunity for indulging with impunity, the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and wick|edne&s;s of his heart. A ruler de&s;titute of virtue, will without doubt in a greater or le&s;s degree be guilty of malepractice. And a government badly admin|i&s;tered, will produce evils introductory, both to public and private infelicity. There is an in&s;epar|able connexion between the moral character of rul|ers, and their admini&s;trations. If the former be vicious, corruption will appear in the latter, and a corrupted admini&s;tration militates again&s;t the very ends of the &s;ocial compact. And of cour&s;e is in|con&s;i&s;tent with the happine&s;s of a community.&mdash;
<PB N="16" REF="032377_0015_0FF2032A51922758">The liberties of a nation are always extremely un|&s;afe, in the hands of vicious rulers; and the mi&s;e|ries which nations have &s;uffered under the govern|ment of &s;uch characters, are to be ranked with the heavie&s;t of divine judgments.</P>
<P>IF then vice in authority be de&s;tructive of pub|lic felicity, it is but rational to conclude that vir|tue exalted to power, mu&s;t be productive of directly contrary effects; and that a pious magi&s;tracy mu&s;t afford the mo&s;t encouraging pro&s;pect, of national happine&s;s. The magi&s;trate, who to the natural and acquired abilities nece&s;&s;ary to prepare him for office, adds the fear of God, a reverence for the dictates of his own con&s;cience, and that love to his fellow|men, implied in true godline&s;s, will not fail to make the good of his con&s;tituents, the ultimate object of his political pur&s;uits. His example will uniformly be in favor of virtue, and his abilities &s;teadily ex|erted to &s;upport and maintain that "righteou&s;ne&s;s which exalteth a nation, and to di&s;countenance and &s;uppre&s;s that vice which is a reproach to any peo|ple." As a legi&s;lator, he will di&s;regard local preju|dices and party views, and ever give his voice in favor of &s;uch laws, as he believes to be founded in ju&s;tice and public utility; and oppo&s;e with firmne&s;s, and uncorruptible integrity tho&s;e of an oppo&s;ite tendency. As a judge, his deci&s;ions will be guided by law and equity, without partiality for, or preju|dice again&s;t any man. In whatever &s;tation he is called to &s;erve his country, he will remember that he is accountable for his conduct not only to his fellow citizens, but to the &s;upreme ruler of the uni|ver&s;e; that he has a mo&s;t important tru&s;t commit|ted to him; that he is a mini&s;ter of God, for good to his people; that the primary de&s;ign to his hon|orary appointment, was to capacitate him to em|ploy all his talents, in promoting and diffu&s;ing happine&s;s through the community; and that he
<PB N="17" REF="032377_0016_0FF2032C32A02CB0">an&s;wers the great end of his being called into office, only &s;o far as he &s;teadfa&s;tly pur&s;ues this grand ob|ject. And that a greater proportion of happine&s;s will be enjoyed by a people, where their rulers are actuated by &s;uch di&s;intere&s;ted motives, than where they are influenced by &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, is too evident to need proof. It is as unnece&s;&s;ary to prove, that men of piety are not only the mo&s;t likely to pur&s;ue the public good, but the only characters, from whom we have rea&s;on &s;teadily to expect, &s;uch di&s;intere&s;ted conduct. Nothing can afford &s;o great a &s;ecurity for the fidelity of rulers, as godline&s;s. Other mo|tives may for a time produce unexceptionable con|duct. But the influence of the&s;e other motives will be ever uncertain, and at be&s;t &s;ub&s;ervient to &s;elfi&s;h views. The public good will always be abandoned by &s;uch a mind, whenever it is con&s;idered as direct|ly oppo&s;ed to private intere&s;t.</P>
<P>No men, in any &s;ituation or employment, are &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the obligations they are under to fidelity as the truly religious. No others &s;o fully perceive its importance, or are &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a conviction of its nece&s;&s;ity. Religion is a crown of glory to all who po&s;&s;e&s;s it. It does not of it&s;elf pre|pare men for office, either in church or &s;tate. But where they are otherways prepared, the addition of true religion, above every thing, contributes to their fidelity and u&s;efulne&s;s. This ob&s;ervation applies with as much propriety, and force to the civil ma|gi&s;tracy, as to any official characters. Fidelity in that office, is e&s;&s;ential to national pro&s;perity. So that godline&s;s, when it lives and reigns in the hearts and lives of the magi&s;trates of a country, contrib|utes directly, and mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially to the public hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. GODLINESS is no le&s;s &s;alutary to a community, by the influence, which it has on the great body of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="032377_0017_0FF203517183C418">As it &s;ecures the fidelity of rulers, &s;o it makes good citizens. If its practice could once become univer&s;al in a nation, it would produce &s;uch a con|duct in all ranks, as would i&s;&s;ue in general pro&s;peri|ty. So far as national happine&s;s depends, on the promotion of the &s;ocial virtues&mdash;on the cultivation of benevolence, kindne&s;s, ju&s;tice and charity&mdash;on the prevalence of harmony and tranquillity, the practice of godline&s;s has a direct tendency to its advancement. Godline&s;s teaches us to do ju&s;tly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with God. To owe no man any thing, but to love one another. To render to all their dues, tribute to whom trib|ute, cu&s;tom to whom cu&s;tom, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor is due. And, to compre|hend the whole in few words, to love our neigh|bour as our&s;elves. So far as the&s;e virtues promote public happine&s;s, or are any way conducive to the pro&s;perity of a nation; &s;o far the &s;alutary influence of godline&s;s is indi&s;putable. As it re&s;pects the du|ties of the &s;econd table of the law, it con&s;i&s;ts in the exerci&s;e of the&s;e very virtues. And how far the prac|tice of them actually does contribute to national pro&s;perity, we may learn from the evils which their oppo&s;ite vices never fail to produce. Fraud, inju&s;|tice, anger, wrath and hatred are mo&s;t evidently the bane of &s;ocial happine&s;s; and in proportion to their prevalency, are invariably productive of mi&s;e|ry. The practice of the&s;e virtues then, and con&s;e|quently of true godline&s;s, has a direct tendency to promote the public good.</P>
<P>AGAIN, &s;o far as national happine&s;s depends on a &s;uitable conduct in the members of a community, toward each other, it is directly promoted by godli|ne&s;s. The circum&s;tance la&s;t mentioned, it is well known, has great influence on dome&s;tic happine&s;s. It is e&s;&s;ential to the pro&s;perity of a private family, that the conduct of each member be regulated by
<PB N="19" REF="032377_0018_0FF203342E72B770">the &s;tricte&s;t rules of propriety&mdash;that the heads con|duct with a dignity becoming their &s;tation; equal|ly remote from unrea&s;onable au&s;terity on the one hand, and trifling familiarity on the other&mdash;that children and &s;ervants, con&s;tantly exhibit reverence and re&s;pect, by an unre&s;erved and cheerful obedi|ence. Imprudence and folly in the governors of a family, and ob&s;tinacy and di&s;obedience in the in|ferior members, are utterly de&s;tructive of dome&s;tic felicity. And why &s;hould not the ca&s;e be the &s;ame with larger communities? The happine&s;s of a na|tion is compo&s;ed of &s;imilar ingredients with that, of a private family. And as the conduct of the &s;eve|ral members of the latter, toward each other, has &s;o evident an influence on their happine&s;s, why mu&s;t not the pro&s;perity of a nation be greatly affected, by the mutual conduct of its rulers and ruled? If &s;o, godline&s;s mu&s;t certainly promote national felicity. For it influences rulers to rule in the fear of God, and unofficered citizens to reverence and re&s;pect the magi&s;trates of their country, as mini&s;ters of the Mo&s;t High, appointed for the good of his people. So far as it extends, it leads every man to conduct agreeable to his &s;tation; to abide in, and faithfully to di&s;charge the duties of his particular calling, and thus to contribute to the advancement of the gene|ral felicity.</P>
<P>BUT I take the liberty of farther ob&s;erving, that godline&s;s promotes national pro&s;perity, as it con|tributes to an increa&s;e of wealth. If any &s;hould call in que&s;tion the truth of this ob&s;ervation, let me de&s;ire him to remember, that there are few vices but what are luxurious; that they are expen&s;ive, and even prodigal both of time and money; and that tho&s;e which are mo&s;t corrupting, which &s;pread their contagion the mo&s;t rapidly, which ever have and ever will prevail where godline&s;s is neglected, are not only &s;uch as devour property, but &s;uch as introduce
<PB N="20" REF="032377_0019_0FF2033ED72C1160">di&s;ea&s;e, debility, idlene&s;s, and even an aver&s;ion to ev|ery &s;pecies of labor, and thus dry up the very &s;ources of national wealth.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, godline&s;s leads to temper|ance, health, indu&s;try and frugality. It not only retrenches the expen&s;es of extravagance, but it adds to the &s;tock already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, the daily gains of diligence. From the command and example of her divine teacher, &s;he gathers up the fragments, and &s;uffers nothing to be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>IF, after con&s;idering the&s;e particulars, any &s;hould &s;till be di&s;po&s;ed to doubt, whether a general diffu|&s;ion of godline&s;s through a nation, would contrib|ute more to the increa&s;e of its wealth, than the un|re&s;trained reign of vice, let him compare the ex|pen&s;es of the &s;everal virtues included in true godli|ne&s;s, with tho&s;e of their oppo&s;ite vices. Let him for in&s;tance compare the expen&s;es of humility, tem|perance and frugality, with what would be nece&s;&s;a|ry to &s;upport pride, luxury, intemperance and prod|igality, and the compari&s;on will convince him, that it is vice which drains a nation of her wealth. We venture further to offer it as a decided opinion, that if &s;uch a per&s;on &s;hould judge with impartiality, he would meet a conviction, that the fa&s;hionable vices of the pre&s;ent day, are far more expen&s;ive than the &s;upport of government, together with all the pub|lic and private means of literary, moral and reli|gious in&s;truction. The univer&s;al &s;pread of godline&s;s among us, would &s;ave this enormous expen&s;e, and thus increa&s;e the pecuniary advantages of our nation. So true is it that godline&s;s is profitable unto <HI>all things,</HI> having promi&s;e of <HI>the life that now is,</HI> and of that which is to come.</P>
<P>BUT permit me to add, that godline&s;s, above ev|ery other principle that can be named, gives efficacy
<PB N="21" REF="032377_0020_0FF20356E6EAFB70">to the laws of a nation. Among many other ingre|dients, nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of a people, a good code of laws will doubtle&s;s be included. But &s;imply the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of laws, will be but of little advantage, unle&s;s they are &s;acredly regarded&mdash; unle&s;s they po&s;&s;e&s;s a commanding influence on all ranks of citizens. Laws, that have lo&s;t their influ|ence, neither afford protection to the virtuous, nor lay re&s;traint on the exce&s;&s;es of the vicious. And laws di&s;regarded and trampled on with impunity will ever lo&s;e their influence. Of con&s;equence, the &s;upport of law, by giving it as exten&s;ive an obedi|ence as po&s;&s;ible, and by putting its penalty in exe|cution on delinquents, mu&s;t be of high importance to national pro&s;perity. And yet no part of civil government is attended with more, or greater diffi|culties. Men of true piety will &s;ee, and feel the im|portance of giving efficacy to laws, and from the pure&s;t motives, throw their whole weight into that &s;cale.&mdash;They will obey the ordinances of man for the Lord's &s;ake. But the vicious part of every community are always impatient under the re&s;traints of law; and ready to violate it, whenever they can flatter them&s;elves of doing it with impunity. Hence the well known fact, that laws are trampled upon, in proportion to the increa&s;e of vice. The more gro&s;s wickedne&s;s prevails, the more are all laws di|vine and human di&s;regarded. The inference from this fact is plain, that no principle can give &s;uch an efficacious influence to the laws of a nation, as true godline&s;s. There is a clo&s;e connection between fi|delity to God, and fidelity to man; he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the former will not neglect the latter. Con&s;equent|ly the diffu&s;ion of true religion through a nation, would in this re&s;pect, be attended with a mo&s;t happy influence.</P>
<P>BUT it is worthy of further remark, that godli|ne&s;s not only contributes to the maintenance and
<PB N="22" REF="032377_0021_0FF20358A141EA80">&s;upport of law, by its influence on the hearts and lives of its true friends; but the doctrines of reveal|ed religion, have a happy political effect on all who believe them, even with a &s;peculative faith. The corruptions of mankind, it is believed, are far more re&s;trained, from an apprehen&s;ion and dread of fu|ture puni&s;hment, than from all the penalties, which &s;anction the &s;everal codes of human laws. Revealed religion denounces future wrath, not only again&s;t per&s;ons guilty of impiety toward God; but again&s;t murderers, thieves, adulterers, perjured per&s;ons, and all who commit crimes again&s;t &s;ociety. So far as divine revelation is believed&mdash;&s;o far as it gains even an hi&s;torical a&s;&s;ent from mankind, the idea of this future puni&s;hment, mu&s;t operate as a forcible check to human corruptions. The&s;e penalties, admitting the authenticity of the &s;criptures, are known by the impenitent to be unavoidable, and therefore affect the mind as realities. No concealment, no fraud, no flight, can protect the offender from the ven|geance of the judge. If the &s;inner dies in impeni|tency, he mu&s;t unavoidably &s;uffer the dreadful con|&s;equences. But men can ea&s;ily e&s;cape the penalties of human laws. Under the be&s;t executed govern|ment, the probability is that they are actually avoid|ed in more in&s;tances, than &s;uffered by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. The means of e&s;caping civil puni&s;hments are very numerous, and perfectly known to the mo&s;t vicious part of every nation. So that human laws are al|ways tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed with a hope of impunity. If then all dread of future puni&s;hment were totally annihi|lated, the &s;tronge&s;t &s;upport of civil law, would be removed, and very little be left to re&s;train the cor|ruptions of the vicious. And the con&s;equence might be an ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;uppprting civil gov|ernment.</P>
<P>FROM the foregoing ob&s;ervations we may at lea&s;t conclude, that godline&s;s is not only highly advanta|geous,
<PB N="23" REF="032377_0022_0FF2035A6E4926D0">but that, a belief of its doctrines, and e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e which re&s;pect the divine character and future rewards and 0puni&s;hments, are e&s;&s;ential to the well being, if not to the exi&s;tence of civil &s;ociety. And it is a well known fact that all antiquity were in favor of a &s;imilar &s;entiment. Not a &s;ingle legi&s;|lator has ever attempted to enforce obedience to his laws, &s;olely on the foundation of civil &s;anctions. They univer&s;ally perceived the in&s;ufficiency of the&s;e motives, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by tho&s;e derived from religion. And as they were &s;trangers to divine revelation, they formed a &s;ub&s;titute, and adapted it, as well as they could, to the circum&s;tances, the genius, and the prejudices of their people. Lycurgus, Solon, Numa Pompilius, Capac, and every legi&s;lator, at all famed for the wi&s;dom of his in&s;titutions, found it nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to religion; and, in fact, derived from that &s;ource, the principle mo|tives to enforce obedience. This &s;hows, that in the judgment of the&s;e eminent men, the belief of a &s;u|preme Being, and the practice of &s;ome religion, are of great importance to the &s;upport of civil govern|ment; and that it is in vain to expect that a &s;y&s;tem of laws can be maintained for any con&s;iderable pe|riod, independent of all a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this kind. An opinion, as is confidently &s;uppo&s;ed, founded in a very accurate, and exten&s;ive knowledge of human nature, and which, we cannot but pre&s;ume, will be ever found true, as long as &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions and affec|tions po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch an influence on mankind.</P>
<P>IF then &s;ome religion has ever been found nece&s;|&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of civil government; if where the true religion has been unknown, the able&s;t le|gi&s;lators have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to invent a &s;ub&s;|titute; if even an hi&s;torical belief of the doctrines of revealed religion, have &s;o direct a tendency to &s;up|port civil in&s;titutions; certainly the reality it&s;elf, the general &s;pread of true piety among all ranks in a

commonwealth, mu&s;t be attended with the mo&s;t &s;al|utary effects. Its influence on the order, the regu|larity, the peace, and the harmony of a community, cannot fail of augmenting its felicity.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee then, that be&s;ide the &s;piritual and eternal advantages of true godline&s;s, which the de&s;ign of this di&s;cour&s;e will not admit of our con&s;idering, there are important benefits to be derived from it in the admini&s;tration of civil government; and if gen|erally and faithfully practi&s;ed, it would mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tially contribute toward obtaining for, and &s;ecuring to a community all the valuable ends of &s;uch an in|&s;titution.</P>
<P>IF the preceding ob&s;ervations be ju&s;t, then to maintain, that godline&s;s is of no importance in a civil point of view&mdash;that gentlemen may be every way as well qualified, to act in any official character, in the government of a nation without, as with reli|gion&mdash;that it is a matter of no con&s;equence to the political happine&s;s of a people, what religious &s;y&s;|tem, or whether any at all prevails among them,&mdash;to &s;upport the&s;e, and &s;imilar &s;entiments, not only tends to the encouragement of immorality, but to the propagation of political here&s;y. And in pro|portion to their prevalence, mu&s;t be productive of the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences. Without reli|gion, a &s;en&s;e of moral obligation can never be pre|&s;erved. And once de&s;troy a &s;en&s;e of moral obliga|tion, and you &s;trike a deadly blow at the root of all mutual confidence between the different members of the community, and invite the &s;pread of tho&s;e vices, which are mo&s;t ho&s;tile to the political as well as e|ternal intere&s;t of mankind.</P>

And let us with caution indulge the &s;uppo&s;ition, that morality can be maintained without religion.

<P><Q>IT is &s;ub&s;tantially true, that virtue or morality is a nece&s;&s;ary &s;pring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or le&s;s force to every &s;pecies of free government.

<P><PB N="27" REF="032377_0026_0FF203448E7504F0">BUT we &s;u&s;pend the&s;e plea&s;ing reflections, and proceed to remark, that if the ob&s;ervations which have been made be ju&s;t, the importance of &s;upport|ing chri&s;tianity is undeniable. All the political ben|efits, which can be rationally expected from any religion ever taught in this world, may certainly be expected from the chri&s;tian, and in a much higher degree than from any other, in proportion to the &s;uperior excellency of its moral precepts. The can|did enemies of our faith confe&s;s, that the morality taught in the go&s;pel is the mo&s;t pure, and the be&s;t adapted to the purpo&s;es of &s;ocial happine&s;s, of any moral &s;y&s;tem ever publi&s;hed to men. If then &s;ome religion be nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of civil government, chri&s;tianity even on political views ought to be preferred to all others, as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es far the greate&s;t tendency to promote the important de|&s;igns already mentioned. If its morals are the pure&s;t, its tendency to promote &s;ocial happine&s;s is the great|e&s;t, and therefore good policy requires its &s;upport.</P>
<P>IT is not however our wi&s;h that any thing &s;imilar to the religious e&s;tabli&s;hments of Europe, &s;hould be introduced into our country. We hope never to &s;ee our magi&s;trates employed, in pre&s;cribing articles of faith; nor in the exerci&s;e of the lea&s;t coercive power to compel men to adopt this, or that creed, or &s;ubmit to any one mode of wor&s;hip in preference to another. May liberty of con&s;cience, in this land, be never violated. But if there be important polit|ical advantages to be derived from chri&s;tianity, which cannot be &s;o effectually &s;ecured by any other means, as appears evident from the preceding ob|&s;ervations, then is it as much the duty of govern|ment to endeavour its pre&s;ervation, as in any other way to &s;eek the public good. If every individual be left to choo&s;e for him&s;elf both with re&s;pect to doctrines, and modes of wor&s;hip, laws made for the &s;upport of public in&s;truction, and the religious ob|&s;ervation

<P>IF religion then has a ju&s;t claim to the protection of government, it mu&s;t be peculiarly important to official characters. The more exalted gentlemen are in office, the more public and exten&s;ive their &s;phere of action, the more nece&s;&s;ary is it, that their whole conduct &s;hould exhibit undeniable evidence of their attachment to religion. The great body of the people look up to them, not only for examples in every virtue, but for that legi&s;lative encourage|ment to the cau&s;e of religion, on which its general pro&s;perity under God mu&s;t in a great mea&s;ure de|pend. If godline&s;s be profitable unto all things, if its political advantages be as great as has been re|pre&s;ented, good policy will certainly lead to a pre&s;|ervation of the laws for the &s;upport of morality, to a maintenance and if need be, to an enlargement of the &s;tatutes for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of vice, and to the appointment of &s;uch men to fill the &s;everal offices under our government, as are known to be at lea&s;t men of unblemi&s;hed morals. A &s;teady adherence to this rule would di&s;appoint the hopes of the wick|ed, and proportionably encourage tho&s;e of the vir|tuous. It would make our legi&s;lature a terror in|deed to evil doers, and a prai&s;e to them who do well. Much depends on the conduct of rulers. To &s;upport religion, law and liberty, is theirs. We live in a day when each of the&s;e have many foes. When the advocates of infidelity are loudly boa&s;ting of the increa&s;e of their numbers&mdash;When licentiou&s;|ne&s;s is alarmingly prevalent, and when the federal con&s;titution, the great palladium of our liberties, has been violently attacked. That amid&s;t all the&s;e in|ternal evils, and the dangers which ari&s;e from for|eign in&s;ults and depredations, our rulers may be di|rected by unerring wi&s;dom&mdash;that they may ever po&s;&s;e&s;s that firmne&s;s and fidelity, which the arduous
<PB N="29" REF="032377_0028_0FF2037387A53AC8">duties of their &s;tation, and the peculiar difficulties of the day require, is the ardent prayer of all their pi|ous con&s;tituents. And &s;upported by &s;o important an encouragement, it is hoped, and expected that they will di&s;regard the unfounded clamours, of the enemies of religion and our country.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides the &s;upport which chri&s;tianity has a right to expect from government, it is of the high|e&s;t importance, that it receive all encouragement from ever y cla&s;s of citizens. In this bu&s;ine&s;s all &s;hould be united, and extend as far, and as general|ly as po&s;&s;ible the practice of true piety. If there were no futurity, if the race of men had been made only for this world, &s;till the univer&s;al practice of godline&s;s would be a mo&s;t de&s;irable object, and as &s;uch mu&s;t meet the &s;incere approbation of every friend to his country. And if &s;o, how inconceivably important indeed is it, when we are a&s;&s;ured by a well authenticated revelation from heaven, that we are all acting not for time only, or principally, but for the rewards, or the puni&s;hments of an eternity. The motives to the choice and practice of godline&s;s are immen&s;ely great. Both temporal and eternal ben|efit, the promi&s;e of this life and of that which is to come, are all pre&s;ented to our view, and placed in a very con&s;picuous light before our eyes, and nothing but the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;tupidity can prevent our feeling the force of them.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ubject leads me further to remark, that al|though the laws of our land have excu&s;ed clergy|men from the burdens of civil functions, and left them at liberty to devote their whole time to the bu&s;ine&s;s of their peculiar profe&s;&s;ion, yet no body of men are more deeply intere&s;ted in the pro&s;perity of their country, or under greater obligations to con&s;tant ex|ertions for that purpo&s;e. And happily their duty as chri&s;tian mini&s;ters, and as members of civil &s;ocie|ty
<PB N="30" REF="032377_0029_0FF203486CA8EC20">perfectly coincide. In the former, which is the principal capacity in which they are called to act, they are pointedly commanded by their divine Ma&s;|ter, to become <HI>en&s;amples to the whole flock over which the Holy Gho&s;t has made them over&s;eers, and to teach, rebuke and exhort with all long &s;uffering and doctrine.</HI> The fir&s;t object of their labors is to prepare men for the kingdom of heaven. This they are to attempt by explaining to them the nature, and enforcing on them the importance of true godline&s;s, and by per|&s;uading them, if po&s;&s;ible, to a faithful practice of it in all its branches. If they can effect this great purpo&s;e, they will not only benefit the &s;ouls of men, and advance the kingdom of the Redeemer in the world, but do a mo&s;t important &s;ervice to civil &s;o|ciety. If they can become the happy in&s;truments of leading tho&s;e among whom they labor, to for|&s;ake &s;in, to embrace the go&s;pel, to love God and practi&s;e every branch of true piety; they will no doubt obey magi&s;trates, and &s;ubmit them&s;elves to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's &s;ake. The more we promote the intere&s;t of religion, the more &s;hall we advance that of civil &s;ociety. The more &s;piritual good we do the &s;ouls of men, the more ef|fectual aid &s;hall we afford to the rulers of our land. Mini&s;ters have every argument &s;et before them, to excite them to diligence and fidelity, drawn from the temporal, and the eternal intere&s;t of men. And in addition to all this, they are further animated, by a con&s;ideration of that future account which they mu&s;t give of them&s;elves, before an a&s;&s;embled univer&s;e. Though the &s;tupidity of this infidel age, may often excite in them the complaint of the evangelical prophet "that they labor in vain and &s;pend their &s;trength for nought," yet let them not be weary in well doing, but per&s;evere with redoubled diligence, &s;upported by the glorious hope that their labor will not be in vain in the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="032377_0030_0FF2034A41B992F8">LASTLY, the foregoing ob&s;ervations point out to us all, the &s;ure means of promoting national happi|ne&s;s. Public virtue, and political pro&s;perity are in|timately connected. Righteou&s;ne&s;s will exalt, and vice bring ruin on a people. If then we are true patriots, if it is our glory <HI>really to be,</HI> as well as to be <HI>e&s;teemed</HI> the friends of our country, we &s;hall devote our&s;elves to the &s;incere practice of true godline&s;s; and in our &s;everal &s;tations faithfully endeavour its univer&s;al promotion. Enmity to religion is incon|&s;i&s;tent with true patrioti&s;m. They who are either publicly or privately undermining the foundation of piety toward God, are weakening the force of moral obligation, and aiming a fatal blow again&s;t the dear|e&s;t privileges re&s;ulting from the &s;ocial compact. If we would wi&s;h to be a happy people, to enjoy in peace and tranquillity the ble&s;&s;ings of a mo&s;t excel|lent con&s;titution, and to tran&s;mit tho&s;e fruits of &s;uch va&s;t expen&s;e of blood and trea&s;ure unimpaired to po&s;terity, it is of the highe&s;t importance, that we practi&s;e true godline&s;s; as every other expedient, while that is neglected, will be found utterly in&s;uffi|cient.</P>
<P>IN one word, the choice and practice of religion is urged on us, by every con&s;ideration which ought to affect a rational mind. Our duty to God, our country, and our&s;elves require it&mdash;our intere&s;t and happine&s;s for time and eternity demand it of us. May God, of his infinite mercy grant us all, to ex|perience it, in all its power, and in all its comforts and con&s;olations, for the &s;ake of the dear Redeem|er.</P>
