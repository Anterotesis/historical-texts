<P>WHY blame me?&mdash;Why blame me?&mdash;My &s;i&s;ter had the &s;ole management of your daughter by your own authority, from the age of &s;ix years, till within eight months of the pre&s;ent time, when, in con&s;e|quence of my &s;i&s;ter's death, &s;he was transferred to my pro|tection.</P>

<P>Your &s;i&s;ter, Mr. Norberry, was a prudent good woman&mdash;&s;he never could in&s;truct her in all this vice.</P>

<P>&mdash;Depend upon it, my dear friend, that Mi&s;s Dorrillon, your daughter, came to my hou&s;e ju&s;t the &s;ame heedle&s;s woman of fa&s;hion you now &s;ee her.</P>

<P>There is nothing which may not be repaired, Maria, with you for a guide&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Me! She turns me into ridicule&mdash;laughs at me! This morning, as &s;he was enumerating &s;ome of her frivolous expences, &s;he ob&s;erved me lift up my hands and &s;igh; on which &s;he named <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ifty other extravagances &s;he had no occa&s;ion to mention, merely to enjoy the pang which every folly of her's &s;ends to my heart.</P>

William Dorrillon, did &s;he know you were her father, every word you uttered, every look you glanced, would be received with gentlene&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion:&mdash;but your pre&s;ent rebukes from Mr. Mandred (as you are called) from a perfect &s;tran|ger, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;es, &s;he con&s;iders as an impertinence which &s;he has a right to re&s;ent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h I had continued abroad. And yet, the hope of beholding her, and of be&s;towing upon her the riches I acquired, was my &s;ole &s;upport through all the toils by which I gained them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And, con&s;idering her pre&s;ent cour&s;e of life, your riches could not come more opportunely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>She &s;hall never have a farthing of them. Do you think I have encountered the perils of almo&s;t every cli|mate, to &s;quander my hard-earned fortune upon the paltry vicious plea&s;ures in which &s;he delights? No&mdash;I have been now in your hou&s;e exactly a month&mdash;I will &s;tay but one day longer&mdash;and then, without telling her who I am, I will leave the kingdom and her for ever&mdash;Nor &s;hall &s;he know that this in&s;ignificant merchant whom &s;he de&s;pi&s;es, was her father, till he is gone, never to be recalled.</P>

<P>You are offended with &s;ome ju&s;tice; but, as I have often told you, your exce&s;&s;ive delicacy and re&s;pect for the conduct of the other &s;ex, degenerate into rigour.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True&mdash;for what I &s;ee &s;o near perfection as wo|man, I want to &s;ee perfect. WE, Mr. Norberry, can never be perfect; but &s;urely women, women, might ea&s;ily be made angels!</P>

<P>I rejoice, however, at the &s;tratagem by which I have gained a knowledge of her heart: deprived of the means of &s;earching it in her early years, had I at pre&s;ent come as her father, &s;he might have deceived me with counterfeit man|ners, till time di&s;clo&s;ed the impo&s;ition.&mdash;Now at lea&s;t, I am not impo&s;ed upon.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: but in very ill humour. I came to London early this morning with my family for the winter, and found my hou&s;e, after going through only a &s;light repair, &s;o damp, that I dare not &s;leep in it: and &s;o I am now &s;ending and going all over the town to &s;eek for lodgings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then &s;eek no farther, but take up your lodg|ings here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To be plain with you, I called in hopes you would a&s;k me; for I am &s;o delicately &s;crupulous in re&s;pect to lady Priory that I could not bear the thought of taking her to an hotel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. <HI>Nor.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then pray return home, and bring her hither immediately, with all your luggage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am mo&s;t extremely obliged to you (<HI>very fervently</HI>); for into no one hou&s;e belonging to any of my ac|quaintance would I take my wife, &s;o &s;oon as into yours. I have now been married eleven years, and during all that time I have made it a rule never to go on a vi&s;it&punc; &s;o as to dome&s;ti|cate, in the hou&s;e of a married man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Wm.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>May I enquire the rea&s;on of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord <HI>Priory.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is becau&s;e I am married my&s;elf; and ha|ving always treated my wife according to the ancient mode of treating wives, I would rather &s;he &s;hould never be an eye|witne&s;s to the modern hou&s;ehold management</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>That I am proud of Did you never ob&s;erve, that &s;eldom a breach of &s;idelity in a wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> is expo&s;ed, where the unfortunate hu&s;band is not &s;aid to be "he be&s;t creature in the world?

<P>So I am &s;till&mdash;apt to be ha&s;ty and pa&s;&s;ion|ate&mdash;but that is rather of advantage to me as a hu&s;band&mdash;it cau&s;es me to be obeyed without he&s;itation&mdash;no liberty for contention, tears or repining.
