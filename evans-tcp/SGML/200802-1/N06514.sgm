<Q>&mdash;Fear GOD: Honour the King.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Principal and mo&s;t Noble de|&s;ign of our being made Rational Creatures, is to Capacitate us for Religion; and thereby to Qualify us for U&s;efulne&s;s in the World, and for the Enjoyment of our Maker: An End, truly worthy of it's Author, and our Exi&s;tence. So that &s;ome have tho't, that a Religious Creature, or a Creature capable of Religion; a better Definition of Man, than merely a Rational Creature or a Creature Endowed with Rea&s;onable Under&s;tanding: Becau&s;e what ever Re&s;emblance of Rea&s;on may appear in &s;ome parts of the Sen&s;itive Creation; yet none of Religion. And by how much the more we exert our&s;elves in the Practice of Religion and Moral Virtue; By &s;o much the better do we Conform to the Injunction in our Text. <HI>Fear God, Honour</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="008267_0005_102E781971D464B8">
<HI>the King.</HI> Loyalty being Dictated as an E&s;&s;ential part of Duty, both by the Light of Nature &amp; Revelation. And nothing is more Evident, than it's being &s;trictly Enjoined in our Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion. I need not go from my Text &amp; Context to Confirm this. The Apo&s;tle in the 9th ver&s;e of the Context Re|minds tho&s;e to whom He wrote, of their pe|culiar Priviledge &amp; Dignity as Chri&s;tians and Saints; and the Obligations they were under to Conduct, accordingly: <HI>But ye are a Cho&s;en Generation, a Royal Prie&s;thood, an Holy Nation, a peculiar People; that ye &s;hould &s;hew forth the Prai&s;es of him who hath called you out of Darkne&s;s into marvellous light.</HI> In the 11th &amp; 12th ver&s;es, He be&s;echeth them to be ex|treemly careful of their Moral conduct and Conver&s;ation: that they give no Occa&s;ion to the <HI>Gentiles</HI> to reproach them with Licentiou&s;|ne&s;s &amp; Di&s;loyalty: <HI>But to Submit to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's &s;ake: whe|ther it be to the King as Supream; or unto Governors, as unto them that are Sent by him for the puni&s;hment of evil doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well. i. e.</HI> To be Sub|ject to Civil Government, out of Con&s;cience, and Obedience to God, who has Ordained the Civil Magi&s;tracy, and Commands Obedience unto it. There are two things implyed in this, (1.) That Di&s;obedience to Civil Autho|rity proceeds from Mens Lu&s;ts, (2) That &s;uch
<PB N="7" REF="008267_0006_102E781D9C6B2198">
Di&s;obedience, would open the Mouth of Un|believers again&s;t the Go&s;pel: and that a Loyal behaviour will put to Silence the ignorance of Fooli&s;h Men; as in ver&s;e 15. In the next words the Apo&s;tle &s;eems to prevent a &s;ecret Objection. Some might Reply, we are free in Chri&s;t, and therefore owe no Obedience to any above us. The Apo&s;tle grants the An|ticedent, under&s;tanding it of their freedom from the burden &amp; cur&s;e of the Law, &amp; the bondage of Sin &amp; Satan; but withal he Ad|moni&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s them not to withdraw their Obedi|ence to the Magi&s;trate, under this pretence: <HI>As free and Not u&s;ing your Liberty for a Cloak of Maliciou&s;ne&s;s, but as the Servants of God.</HI> But &s;ays He, in the next words, <HI>Honour all Men,</HI> according to their State and Calling: <HI>Love the brotherhood,</HI> as becomes Saints; and to include all in a word, <HI>Fear God&punc; Honour the King.</HI> i. e. Let your Religious &amp; Civil de|portment be &s;uch as becomes your Profe&s;&s;ion as Chri&s;tians: Examples of Virtue &amp; Piety, and a Bar to every Objection.</P>
<P>I &s;hall improve the words more fully un|der this DOCTRINAL Ob&s;ervation, viz.</P>
<P><HI>That Religion and Loyalty is the Duty and Glory of a People.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e things are implyed in the words; in as much as the <HI>Fear of God</HI> includes the
<PB N="8" REF="008267_0007_102E7833C098B9A8">
whole of Religion, and <HI>Honouring the King</HI> all Loyalty and Subjection that is due to Civil Authority.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;ay the Fear of God, is often put to Expre&s;s the &s;um of our Religion, and the whole of Duty, as in Job 28. 28. <HI>And unto man he &s;aid, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wi&s;dom, and to depart from evil is un|der&s;tanding.</HI> P&s;al. 111. 10. <HI>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wi&s;dom: a good un|der&s;tanding have all they that do his command|ments.</HI> And Eccl. 12. 13. <HI>Let us hear the conclu&s;ion of the whole matter, Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.</HI> Now the Rea&s;on why this is put for the whole of Religion, &s;eems to be, becau&s;e Fear is &s;o powerful a Principle, and has &s;o great an influence upon men to make them Religious. For (<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Tillot&s;on.</NOTE> as one ob&s;erves) it is a Pa&s;&s;ion that is mo&s;t deeply rooted in our natures, &amp; flowes immediately from that Principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation which God has planted in every Man. Every one de&s;ires his own Pre&s;ervation &amp; Happine&s;s, &amp; therefore hath a natural Dread &amp; Horror of every thing that can de&s;troy his Being, or Endanger his Felicity: and the greate&s;t Danger is from the greate&s;t Power, &amp; that is Omnipotency. So that the Fear of God is an inward acknow|legement of a holy and ju&s;t Being, which is
<PB N="9" REF="008267_0008_102E783745F76F70">
Armed with an Almighty &amp; Irre&s;i&s;table Power. God having hid in every Man's Con&s;cience, a &s;ecret awe and dread of his Infinite Power, and Eternal Ju&s;tice. Now Fear being &s;o in|timate to our Natures, it is the &s;tronge&s;t Bond of Laws, and the greate&s;t Security of our Duty. For however much we have lo&s;t the reli&s;h of true Happine&s;s, yet not the &s;en&s;e of Pain &amp; Mi&s;ery; So that what Love does not attract, Fear may excite.</P>
<P N="2">2. That other Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Honouring the King;</HI> includes all Loyalty &amp; due Obedience to the Civil Magi&s;trate: for as the King is the Head and Fountain of Civil Power, &s;o Subordinate Authority, are &s;treams i&s;&s;uing there from. This by a <HI>Metanimia</HI> a Figure often u&s;ed in Scripture, is &s;ufficiently expre&s;|&s;ed.</P>
<P>My Method &s;hall be,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>To &s;hew that Religion is the greate&s;t con|cern of all Orders of Men, and the chiefe&s;t Glory of any People.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>That a Spirit of Loyalty is E&s;&s;ential to the Peace &amp; Happine&s;s of a People.</HI> And</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>To Improve the Subject, and Apply the whole to the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. <HI>Religion is the greate&s;t Concern of all Or|ders of Men, and the chiefe&s;t Glory of a People.</HI> This is of univer&s;al extent; it reaches, (or
<PB N="10" REF="008267_0009_102E7838CAC602C8">
&s;hould do) from the King on the Throne, to the Maid behind the Mill. There is none above it, nor any beneath it. Policy, Power, or Opulency, is the a&s;&s;ignment of but few, but Religion is incumbent upon all: and it is as Beneficial in its Nature, as it is Exten&s;ive in its Regards. It includes the Knowledge of the greate&s;t Things.&mdash;The Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the be&s;t Good;&mdash;and the Enjoyment of the mo&s;t la&s;ting Tranquillity.</P>
<P N="1">1. Religion includes the Knowledge of the Greate&s;t things. To Know God and Chri&s;t, Our&s;elves, and the way to be for ever happy, is certainly the mo&s;t exten&s;ive &amp; u&s;eful Know|ledge. Our Irreligious and unhappy E&s;tate by Nature, is ju&s;tly called a &s;tate of Ig|norance &amp; Darkne&s;s;<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 4. 18.</NOTE> <HI>Having the under|&s;tanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance which is in them, becau&s;e of the blindne&s;s of their hearts.</HI> Now the very Nature &amp; De&s;ign of Religion, is <HI>To open</HI> our <HI>eyes, and to turn</HI> us <HI>from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that</HI> we <HI>may receive forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, and in|heritance among them which are &s;anctified by faith in</HI> Chri&s;t.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts 26. 18.</NOTE> The Knowledge of God in his Nature and Perfections, is truly Excellent and De&s;irable: It gives the greate&s;t Delight and Satisfaction to the Soul, to Di&s;cover and Contemplate tho&s;e his Perfections: For
<PB N="11" REF="008267_0010_102E78ECD50C59F8">
whatever is Beautiful and Amiable, as it is di&s;per&s;ed &amp; &s;cattered in the Creature, is Com|pleat &amp; Centers in God: and not only &s;o, but it Exceeds our Comprehen&s;ion and Con|ception: and there is an agreeable &s;atisfaction in gazing upon, and adoring Incomprehen|&s;ibility; and being &s;wallowed up in the Im|men&s;ity of the Divine Perfections.</P>
<P>Again, To Know God in his Communi|cations, in the Manife&s;tations which he has made of him&s;elf in the K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ngdom of Nature and Providence; but e&s;pecially in the Di&s;|pen&s;ations of his Grace: This is U&s;eful, En|riching and Ravi&s;hing. <HI>All thy works do prai&s;e thee, &amp; thy &s;aints &s;hall ble&s;s thee!</HI> The works of Creation and Providence, do plainly &s;hew forth the Being of a God; But the work of Redemption &s;hews what Kind of Being, God is: One Glorious in Holine&s;s, fearful in Prai&s;es, doing Wonders. The Knowledge of God in Chri&s;t, &amp; in the work of Redemption thro' him, is an Happine&s;s which even the Angels &s;eem to be &s;urprized at, 1 Pet. 1. 12.&mdash;<HI>Which things the Angels de&s;ire to look into.</HI> It is the great My&s;tery of Godline&s;s, the De&s;ign of Eternal Wi&s;dom, the chiefe&s;t of all God's Works: What con|tains the Glorious wonders of his Mercy and Power; wherein he renders him&s;elf mo&s;t wor|thy of our &s;upream Veneration &amp; Affection: our mo&s;t rai&s;ed Thoughts are Infinitely be|neath
<PB N="12" REF="008267_0011_102E78F22F825A80">
it's Dignity. The Light of the Go&s;pel (&s;ays<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Bates.</NOTE> one) hath clearly Revealed &s;o much as is Requi&s;ite to be Known in our earthly State; yet the Sublimer parts are &s;till Secret, and re&s;erved for a full di&s;covery by the Bright|ne&s;s of our Saviour's Appearance.&mdash;It is the mo&s;t excellent Knowledge, as that alone which can &s;atisfy the immortal Appetite; and the mo&s;t Important; for 'tis no le&s;s than our Recovery from Extream &amp; Eternal Mi|&s;ery, and the Re&s;toring of us to the Enjoy|ment of the Ble&s;&s;ed God: a Felicity without Compari&s;on or End: And in proportion to the Regard we have to Salvation, will be our Delight to Know the Means by which we may obtain it.</P>
<P>Therefore, in the next place; To Know Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Author and Fini&s;her of our Faith, &amp; con&s;equently of our Salvation, mu&s;t needs be the mo&s;t Nece&s;&s;ary and Excellent Knowledge. For it is of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity that we Know God in Chri&s;t in order to our being happy: <HI>For this is Life Eternal to Know thee, the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI> We mu&s;t Know him to be more than meerly the Me&s;&s;enger of God, to Publi&s;h the glad Tidings of Salvation, and to Direct in the way of Life: we mu&s;t Know him to be the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of God and the <HI>Power</HI> of God; by the Effectual Application of his
<PB N="13" REF="008267_0012_102E78F5E5688DA8">
Grace to us by his Holy Spirit. But to know him after this manner, we mu&s;t at the &s;ame time know our own Mi&s;ery &amp; Unworthine&s;s, together with the need we have of a Mediator. <HI>Cogno&s;ce te ip&s;um,</HI> Know thy Self; was e&s;teem|ed a Divine Sentence, by the Learned Hea|then, and is known to be of the greate&s;t im|portance by the experienced Chri&s;tian. We ought by no means to &s;eparate tho&s;e two parts of Knowledge; becau&s;e each alone, is not only unprofitable but dangerous. For as <HI>Mon&s;ieur Pa&s;chal</HI> ob&s;erves, The Know|ledge of God without the Knowledge of our own Mi&s;ery, is the Nur&s;e of Pride: The Knowledge of our own Mi&s;ery, without the Knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Mother of De&s;pair. But the true Knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t exempts us alike from Pride and from De&s;pair; by giving us at once a Sight, not only of God, &amp; of our own Mi&s;ery, but al&s;o of the Mercy of God in the Relief of our Mi&s;ery, We may Know God without Knowing our own Mi&s;ery; or we may Know our own Mi&s;ery without Knowing God; or we may Know them both without Knowing the Means of Obtaining from God the Relief of our Mi&s;ery: But we cannot Know Je&s;us Chri&s;t, without the Knowledge of our Mi&s;eries and their Cure. In as much as Je&s;us Chri&s;t is not only God, but he is God under this Cha|racter, the Healer &amp; Repairer of our Mi&s;eries.
<PB N="14" REF="008267_0013_102E78F9503765D0">
Thus all they that &s;eek God without Je&s;us Chri&s;t can never meet with &s;uch Light in their enquiries, as may afford them true Satisfac|tion, or &s;olid Comfort; becau&s;e God is Known and communed with, but in &amp; by a Mediator.</P>
<P N="2">2. Religion puts the Subject into the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the be&s;t Good. Here I would be under&s;tood, what I mean by Religion, when I &s;ay, it includes the Knowledge of the great|e&s;t Things, and the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the be&s;t Good, &amp;c. <HI>viz.</HI> a Divine Principle implant|ed in the Soul which Di&s;po&s;es and Qualifies it for the Service and Enjoyment of God. The unhappy mi&s;take which mankind &s;o ge|nerally labour under with re&s;pect to the Nature of Religion, is the &s;ad Occa&s;ion of its being &s;o much Neglected or Perverted. The conception of its being an Exteriour Bu|&s;ine&s;s, is the Occa&s;ion of its being made an Engine of State, or a No&s;e of Wax that may &s;erve every purpo&s;e. But as Mr. <HI>Shaw</HI> ob|&s;erves, It is not &s;o much given of God, as it&s;elf is &s;omething of God in the Soul: as the Soul is not &s;o properly &s;aid to give, as to be the Life of Man. As the Conjunction of the Soul with the Body, &s;o verily the Life of the Soul &s;tands in its Conjunction with God, by a &s;piritual Union of Will and Affections. The nearne&s;s to God, which a Soul Enjoys by Religion is called a Cohabitation. Thus it is
<PB N="15" REF="008267_0014_102E78FE88BC5018">
expre&s;&s;ed in Scripture;<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 57. 15.</NOTE> <HI>I Dwell in the high and holy Place, with him al&s;o that is of a hum|ble Spirit.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 6. 16.</NOTE> <HI>As God hath &s;aid, I will dwell in them and walk in them.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph, 3. 17.</NOTE> <HI>That Chri&s;t may dwell in their Hearts by Faith.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 3. 16.</NOTE> <HI>Know ye not that ye are the Temples of the Lord, &amp; that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you, &amp;c.</HI> By all which Expre&s;&s;ions, it is evident, that there is a mo&s;t agreeable Intercour&s;e between God, &amp; the Religious Soul; and that hereby it actu|ally Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the greate&s;t and be&s;t Good. For his Favour is Life, and his Loving kind|ne&s;s is better than Life it&s;elf. Which brings me to the la&s;t Thing under this Head, viz.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is the Enjoyment of the mo&s;t la&s;ting Tranquility. There is not all that Advan|tage and Comfort in a Dignified State, that we are ready to apprehend at a Di&s;tance: Good and Grand, are different Things. The Great and the Opulent are ordinarily Envied, as the mo&s;t Comfortable and Happy part of Mankind: But tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s this Station, find they have their Difficulties, which at Times are &s;o Pre&s;&s;ing, that they de&s;erve Pity rather than Envy. But the Soul that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es that Divine Principle of Re|ligion, is &s;ure of Comfort, let its external Circum&s;tances be as they will. This Teach|es how to be Aba&s;ed and how to Abound, and in every State to be Content. It
<PB N="16" REF="008267_0015_102E79000FC1BCB8">
enlightens the Under&s;tanding, informs the Judgment, influences the Will, regulates the Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections, and gives the Man the entire Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him&s;elf, in the mid&s;t of Hurry and Tumult. It is like that benign Stream, of which the P&s;alme&s;t &s;peaks in P&s;alm 46. <HI>We will not Fear, though the Earth be Removed, &amp; though the Mountains be carried into the mid&s;t of the Sea; though the Waters thereof Roar, and be Troubled; though the Mountains Shake with the Swelling thereof: There is a River the</HI> Streams <HI>whereof &s;hall make glad the City of our God.</HI> To be at Peace with God, and our own Con&s;ciences, is the mo&s;t &s;table Peace, and affords the mo&s;t la&s;t|ing Tranquility: and with all its pre&s;ent Ad|vantages, it is but a prelude and foreta&s;te of what we may Expect to po&s;&s;e&s;s and enjoy, in a future and eternal State. There is nothing we have now Ob&s;erved of Religion in its Na|ture and Influence, but what is accomodate to all Men; and peculiarly Incumbent upon tho&s;e in Authority and Power; as we &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to con&s;ider more particularly hereafter.</P>
<P>II. <HI>That a Spirit of Loyalty, is E&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ent Comfort and Happine&s;s of a People: and really comes within our Religious Profe&s;&s;ion and Engagement.</HI></P>
<P>A ju&s;t di&s;charge of the Duties of the &s;econd Table, are as Incumbent as tho&s;e of the fir&s;t.
<PB N="17" REF="008267_0016_102E79022565BB00">
For as we are to Love the Lord our God with all our Heart and Strength, and Might, &s;o we are to Love our Neighbour as our Selves: and in the di&s;charge of Relative Duty (under which comes that of Loyalty) con&s;i&s;ts, no &s;mall part of our Religion, and the Comfort and Happine&s;s of the pre&s;ent Life. A due Obedience to all proper Authority, is not only the Beauty, but Strength &amp; Glory of a People. But Mutiny &amp; Rebellion, are as di&s;tructive to the Political Body, as Sword and Pe&s;tilence to the Natural. There is a certain Mechanic Order, which is Requi&s;ite to adju&s;t the movements of every kind of Body; which if di&s;concerted, will de&s;troy the modle of the whole; and incapacitate the &s;ame for proper action. Where Pride &amp; Vanity is &s;o preva|lent, as to render Men unea&s;y in their proper Station, and trouble&s;ome to their Superiors&punc; it fills the State with Di&s;order &amp; Confu&s;ion&punc; It marrs its Beauty, &amp; &s;aps its Strength: The mo&s;t effective method for preventing or cor|recting of which is, to comply with the In|junction of the Apo&s;tle, viz. For every Man to abide &s;teadfa&s;t in the calling where with God hath called him; and be content with the a&s;|&s;ignments of Providence. God's <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of Old, was never &s;o Renowned &amp; Happy, as when under proper re&s;trictions with re&s;pect to their Order &amp; Government.

<P N="3">3. For Application of what has been &s;aid; I would Ob&s;erve, that Religion which is &s;o univer&s;ally nece&s;&s;ary, is peculiarly incumbent upon Rulers, and tho&s;e in a Dignified State. And that e&s;pecially as it has the mo&s;t direct &amp; powerful tendency to A&s;&s;imilate them to the likene&s;s of the Divine Original of all Power: and Qualifies them for the mo&s;t happy way of Governing. It fills Men with Noble, Ge|nerous, &amp; Heroick Principles; and di&s;po&s;es them to an&s;wer the ends of their Exaltation. It cures them of what is Little, Mean and Selfi&s;h; and puts them upon &s;eeking the Good of others more than them&s;elves. It will cer|tainly correct their inordinate Affection of ex|orbitant Power, and unrea&s;onable Greatne&s;s; by teaching them the Honour &amp; Advantage, of Self-Conque&s;t. The &s;ame holy Principle, will poli&s;h their rough Natures, and &s;weeten their Tempers, and make them Amiable, as well as Honourable in the &s;ight of their Bre|thren: Whereas Irreligion and Impiety, does &s;trangely le&s;&s;en Greatne&s;s, and &s;ecretly &amp; un|avoidably derive &s;ome Weakne&s;s, even upon Authority it&s;elf. But Religion will greatly &s;trengthen their Authority, as it naturally pro|cures

a Veneration, &amp; commands Reverence. This will put them under a double Advan|tage; that whiles they adorn their Po&s;ts, they be&s;t &s;erve the People; and are them&s;elves Examples of what they enjoin others by Pre|cept.

And may it not be well to encourage and continue the Practice of devoting &s;ome pittance of Time in every Week to &s;ocial Prayer; for the Revival of Religion, and the Succe&s;s of his Maje&s;ty's Arms, both in <HI>Eu|rope</HI> and <HI>America:</HI> Agreeable to the Exam|ple of many of our Prote&s;tant Brethren in <HI>Europe,</HI> who, (it &s;eems) are much Encoura|ged, from the gracious Returns they have already received.

to the People, (as well as Rulers) to di&s;po&s;e them to Subject becomingly to proper Au|thority; and yield Obedience from Princi|ples of Con&s;cience, more than merely of Fear. For if Laws were as well adju&s;ted as tho&s;e of <HI>Solon,</HI> or as po&s;&s;itive as tho&s;e of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> of old; they would prove in|effectual without &s;omething more Coercive than merely their own Re&s;trictions. But he that is Actuated by Religion, will cheerfully comply with Duty, and be afraid of Rebel|lion, becau&s;e he believes that who&s;oever re|&s;i&s;teth Authority, re&s;i&s;teth the Ordinance of God; and that they who re&s;i&s;t &s;hall receive to them&s;elves Damnation. But then, Reli|gion, really fits Men for this, as well as en|joins them to it: It Mortifies their Lu&s;ts of Pride, Hatred, Revenge, &amp;c. It furni&s;hes them with a Meek &amp; Quiet Spirit, and Con|vinces them of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of that great Rule of Equity; <HI>What&s;oever ye would that Men &s;hould do unto you, do ye even &s;o to them:</HI> And it Endowes them with Princi|ples of Truth, Hone&s;tly and Loyalty.&mdash;And in as much as the Mo&s;t High, is plea&s;ed to Indulge us with tho&s;e Priviledges and Liberties, whereby we are favoured above many of our Brethren; in that we have our Rulers as at the fir&s;t, and our Judges as at the beginning&punc; And not only have the Liberty

<P>And upon this joyful Occa&s;ion, of our ANNIVERSARY ELECTION; While our Eyes do &s;ee all tho&s;e Great &amp; Good things, which the Lord hath done for us, and yet continues to us; Should not our Hearts be rai&s;ed in peculiar Strains of Gratitude and Thankfulne&s;s?
