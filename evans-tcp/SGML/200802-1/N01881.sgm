<HEAD>To my Friend in the City.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN An&s;wer to your Reque&s;t, I have &s;pent &s;ome thoughts upon the Subject of our la&s;t Conver&s;ation, <HI>viz</HI>: Inocculation, which has cau&s;ed &s;o many idle words, and an|gry Di&s;cour&s;es; to &s;ay no more of 'em. And fir&s;t, as to the practice in it &s;elf con&s;ider'd. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am not Ma&s;ter of Philo&s;ophy enough to enable me to determine for or again&s;t the u&s;e of it, upon natural rea&s;ons: But as fools u&s;e to do, mu&s;t wait till experience does more fully in&s;truct me. But then Secondly, as to the Manner of introducing, and carrying on the practice here in this Country; if I have the truth of the fact, (which I confe&s;s 'tis difficult to come at in this day, to our &s;hame it will be &s;poken) I can but condemn it upon the fol|lowing rea&s;ons; which I offer by way of Que|ry, and &s;ubmit them to you and the Worlds Con&s;ideration and Cen&s;ure. The fact I take to be this: A certain <HI>Clergy-man</HI> (by the way of <HI>Europe</HI>) received Advice of the Practice among the <HI>Ma&s;&s;el-men,</HI> &amp; faithful people of the prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI>; al&s;o more immediately and <HI>viva voce</HI> from &s;ome of the &s;cattered Members of the good people in <HI>Guinea,</HI> who communicated to the Phy&s;itians in your Town; one of whom (without con&s;ent of his Brethren) introduces
<PB N="3" REF="002229_0003_0FDB19120357D1D8">the Practice here in the mid&s;t of a populous Town, &s;oon after, (if not before) the Guards which were placed by Authority at the doors of Infected Hou&s;es, (to prevent the carrying out any Infection) were taken off; when there was at lea&s;t a po&s;&s;ibility that the &s;preading of the Di&s;temper might be prevented. Now again&s;t this, I offer to your Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Whether this Practice was not an offence against the Civil Government, and contrary to the Peace &amp; Quiet of His Majesties Liege People?</HI></P>
<P>How daringly bold this Practice? for one &s;ingle Apothecary, without con&s;ent of his Bre|thren, without asking the Civil Power, without con&s;ent of the Neighbours; yea, again&s;t their Fears, their Cries and Clamours, to infect his Family, with a Di&s;ea&s;e very Mortal and very Contagious! The late riotous wicked di&s;tur|bance, &s;hews the dangerous con&s;equence of &s;uch ra&s;h practices. I mention not this in the lea&s;t to excu&s;e that horrid fact; No, I dete&s;t it as much as any man, and pray God deliver us from &s;uch a Spirit. But I think that <HI>Inocculati|on</HI> as it was fir&s;tly practi&s;ed, carried in it as much threatning and danger; yet being done with a good and charitable intention, &amp; with|out de&s;ign of mi&s;chief to any man, did not ren|der the Actor &s;o criminal. To &s;pread a mor|tal Contagion, What is it but to ca&s;t abroad Arrows and Death? If a man &s;hould wilfully throw a Bomb into a Town, burn a Hou&s;e, or kill a man, ought he not to die? &s;o if a man
<PB N="4" REF="002229_0004_0FDB191445EF93B8">&s;hould wilfully bring Infection from a per&s;on &s;ick of a deadly and contagious Di&s;ea&s;e, into a place of Health; is not the mi&s;chief as great? Suppo&s;e that <HI>Inocculation</HI> is to all tho&s;e that u&s;e it very &s;afe and beneficial, that it an&s;wers all the de&s;ired ends upon them; yet how can they an|&s;wer it, to hazard the de&s;truction of their Neighbours, who are not of their opinion, and dare not practice it! Suppo&s;e then again (as we rea&s;onably may) that of tho&s;e many who are lately &s;lain by the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> &s;ome few have taken it by their <HI>Inocculated</HI> Neighbours, who might otherwi&s;e have e&s;caped it. How &s;hall we excu&s;e our <HI>Mahometan</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries, from being truly, tho' not de&s;ignedly the cau&s;e of their death? If any per&s;ons are &s;atisfied, that this Practice is a good method to &s;ave them from the dangers of a mortal Di&s;ea&s;e which threatens them; I do not &s;ay they ought not to u&s;e it, but they ought to u&s;e it in &s;uch a manner, as may be with Surety to their Neighbours as well as them&s;elves. If men therefore will have &s;uch practices, mu&s;t they not make them lawful, and withdraw from the Community into &s;uch places where there can be no danger to their Neigh|bours, or el&s;e obtain a common con&s;ent</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Whether as the Practice has been carried on, there has not been offered horrid Impiety against Almighty God?</HI></P>
<P>I do not &s;ee how we can be excu&s;ed from great Impiety herein, (altho' the Doctors bold practice was con&s;ecrated by the Authority of
<PB N="5" REF="002229_0005_0FDB1915C321ECF8">five or &s;ix Reverend Sub&s;cribers to a certain Writing, devi&s;ed for that purpo&s;e at the time) when Mini&s;ters and People, with loud &amp; &s;trong Cries made Supplications to Almighty God, to avert the Judgment of the <HI>Small-pox</HI> (profe&s;&s;ing their faith in his Power and Goodne&s;s) that though in the ordinary view of men it mu&s;t &s;pread, yet that it would plea&s;e him (if it might be agreeable to the ends of his Holine&s;s) to Exert his Almighty Power, and be better to us than our fears, in preventing the further &s;preading of the Di&s;temper, as in his Mercies he had heretofore done. And at the &s;ame time, &s;ome have been carrying about in&s;truments of <HI>Inocculation</HI> and bottles of the poi&s;onous Hu|mour to Infect all tho&s;e who were willing to &s;ubmit to it, whereby we might as naturally expect the Infection to &s;pread, as a man to break his bones, by ca&s;ting him&s;elf head-long from the highe&s;t Pinacle. Can any man infect a Family in a Town in the Morning, and pray to God in the Evening, that the Di&s;temper may not &s;pread? No, it is a Temptation from the Devil: for it is written, <HI>Thou &s;halt not tempt the Lord thy God.</HI> No more can any man that have promoted it make this prayer without &s;in. Now then &s;uppo&s;e that to avoid Sin, they have omitted this prayer; is it a right thing to o|mit it? Is not the <HI>Small-pox</HI> a &s;ore Judgment of God? and &s;hould we not then pray, <HI>Deliver us from Evil</HI>? Yes, but then it may be &s;aid, that tho' the <HI>Small-pox</HI> as God &s;ends it in the com|mon
<PB N="6" REF="002229_0006_0FDB191A45C850F0">cour&s;e of his Providence be a &s;ore Judg|ment, yet by this invention of <HI>Inocculation,</HI> it becomes much lighter; and tho' we don't pray that it may not &s;pread, yet by praying for a ble&s;&s;ing on this practice, we pray again&s;t the Judgment. This is indeed the be&s;t face that can be put upon it, in my opinion; and in this dre&s;s if we view it well, it has an horrible a&s;|pect; and I wi&s;h it don't in the end prove a Fighting as well as praying again&s;t the Judg|ments of God. Are we not all one Church of Chri&s;t, and People of God? and &s;hall we divide in our Supplications to God, and think to be heard of him? One part praying &amp; confe&s;&s;ing, <HI>Lord we have Sinned, and are afraid of thy Judg|ments which are out against us; &s;ay unto thy de|stroying Angel, it is enough, stay now thine hand; and Lord, if it be thy holy Will, let not this &s;ore Di&s;ea&s;e &s;pread further among us</HI>! And another part praying, <HI>Lord, we have Sinned, &amp; thy Judg|ments are upon us in &s;ore Sickne&s;s; but we have (by thy Providence) found out a way to lighten it, give us thy ble&s;&s;ing upon it, &amp; then it &s;pread, the faster the better; no danger of death this way, and but little &s;ickne&s;s; and let us have the benefit of this Invention, tho' others of thy people that are &s;o blind they will not &s;ee the benefit of it, are ever &s;o much endangered by it.</HI> The&s;e la&s;t words &s;ound a little har&s;h, but is it not the true language of the practice? Thus we are brought into a &s;tate of War, Sin and Contention in our very prayers, by carrying on this practice in &s;uch a lawle&s;s, un|guarded
<PB N="7" REF="002229_0007_0FDB191BAE7EC178">manner; and did the Gentlemen that promoted it ever think of any regulation? I am &s;ure they never effected it, which ought to have been the very fir&s;t &s;tep in a matter of &s;uch con|cernment to a people. Now as the&s;e things have an evil a&s;pect in them&s;elves, is it not evi|dent, that they have &s;o in their effects &amp; con|&s;equences? In&s;tead of being humbled under the holy hand of God in this Judgment upon us, and treating one another with meekne&s;s &amp; charity, are we not filled with contentions, and every wicked work? I pray God grant us Re|pentance, le&s;t de&s;pi&s;ing the Cha&s;tenings of the Almighty, we provoke him to bring yet &s;orer Plagues upon us.</P>
<P><HI>Sir.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;ee that at pre&s;ent I am neither Inocculator nor Anti-inocculator, con&s;idering it only in a Phy&s;ical &s;ence: But I mu&s;t condemn upon the foregoing rea&s;ons, &s;uch a ra&s;h managing a matter of &s;o great concern, without advice or Caution which in my opinion is a great Contempt to God and Man. That which moved me to An&s;wer you ju&s;t at this time is, the fear that I and my Neigh|bours are in, for our &s;elves and Families. We are advi&s;ed that the Practice of <HI>Inocculation</HI> is carrying on in our Country Towns, which (if it proceed) will undoubtedly infect and endanger the Lives of va&s;t numbers more than otherwi&s;e would be: I mean of &s;uch as are not to be <HI>Inocculation.</HI> The <HI>Small-pox</HI> thro' Gods Goodne&s;s has not been wont to &s;pread generally in our Country Towns; but a Family here and there has been vi&s;ited. But now, if this Practice obtain among us, &s;uppo&s;e but
<PB N="8" REF="002229_0008_0FDB191D27A43D38" MS="y">a few, &s;ay a Twentieth part of a Town take up with it, living in the &s;everal Quarters of the Town: It will undoubtedly infect the whole. I know &s;ome will &s;ay, they may all be <HI>Inocculated,</HI> its an Excllent way; They will be &s;afe in the u&s;e of it, and ever after out of Danger. But generally People are not per&s;waded of either the expediency or Lawfulne&s;s of the Practice; and if &s;ome are, &s;hall they in this manner force it upon others? Is it &s;o plea&s;ant and beneficial, that 'tis better to undergo it than not, where we may by the ble&s;&s;ing of God up|on a proper care be in little danger? For my part, when I &s;ee this Sword of the Almighty in the Angels hand, I tremble, &amp; am afraid of his Judgments? But let him wield his own weapons; &amp; if he &s;lay me, <HI>yet will I tru&s;t in him.</HI> But when I hear of <HI>Quacks</HI> boldly medling with the&s;e edged tools, in &s;uch a ra&s;h and lawle&s;s man|ner; (tho' the hand of God is to be &s;een in this al&s;o,) yet it rai&s;es other re&s;entments in me. And it is ama|zing to me, that the worthy Members of our General A&s;&s;embly, my Country Neighbours (who &s;tart from their bu&s;ine&s;t, looking pale with fear by the danger of this Di&s;temper) &s;hould not &s;pend one thought upon this practice, which will render their danger a thou&s;and to one greater. And now after all, to their Con&s;iderati|on we mu&s;t leave it, hoping in their care and wi&s;dom this matter may be brought under &s;ome regulation; That if they allow it, there may be proper Pe&s;t Hou&s;es in &s;olitary places, to receive tho&s;e that have a mind thus voluntarily to infect them&s;elves, with &s;evere pe|nalties on tho&s;e that &s;hall dare to do otherwi&s;e, to the endangering the lives of their hone&s;t Neighbours; or el&s;e to bani&s;h the Practice to the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Pagans</HI>&punc; whence it came; and if ever they allow it in &s;uch an unguarded manner as we have done, I dare to be bound to be Inocculated.</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Dear <HI>Francis,</HI></SALUTE> I bid thee heartily Farewel.</CLOSER>
