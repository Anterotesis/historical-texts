<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MANY Phy&s;icians have publi&s;hed in the new&s;pa|pers of this country, their methods of preventing and curing this di&s;ea&s;e, which may be ranked as one of the mo&s;t de&s;tructive and fatal;&mdash;but none of them have yet thought of favoring the public with an accurate ac|count of the nature and particular &s;ymptoms of the fever, that makes &s;uch cruel havoc.</P>
<P>Never agreeing among them&s;elves, they have mu|tually oppo&s;ed the opinions of each other, and have often be&s;towed reciprocal offence. The re&s;ult of this difference of ideas, always dangerous for &s;uffer|ing humanity, has been, that each pre&s;cribed accord|ing to his own manner, as well for pre&s;erving per&s;ons again&s;t the contagion, as for treating the di&s;ea&s;e, by bleeding, dra&s;tic purges, by &s;timulants, by diluents, by demulcents, by anti&s;eptics, and by tonics, without pointing out, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, the circum&s;tances or particular ca&s;es, wherein &s;uch medicines might be employed or rejected.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="025855_0005_0FCF6C628B121758">The mo&s;t credulous among&s;t the people, alarmed by the public papers, and by the numerous precau|tions advi&s;ed to be taken again&s;t the pretended pe&s;tilence, began to admini&s;ter medicines to them|&s;elves, and in order to avoid imaginary evils, pro|duced real ones; &s;ome by having recour&s;e to the heat|ing regimen, gave additional fire to their di&s;ea&s;e, and thus created their own graves&mdash;others applied to phy&s;icians, who, &s;mitten with fear, thought that they perceived pe&s;tilential appearances in a common di&s;order, and or|dered medicines, which could only add to the evil. Of con&s;equence, tho&s;e who did not fall a &s;acrifice, reco|vered with difficulty. Hence the number of the &s;ick and dead have amazingly encrea&s;ed; and the &s;entiment of fear operating upon every mind, has made the great|e&s;t part of the inhabitants to leave the city, and for|&s;ake in it, without attendance or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the &s;ick, who were not able to quit it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I could mention &s;everal facts to prove the melancholy &s;ituation of the &s;ick, from the de&s;ertion of their friends; but we mu&s;t forgive tho&s;e individuals, in favor of many of the inhabitants of Philadelphia, who have hurried to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the poor with an ardor which does ho|nour to humanity.</NOTE></P>
<P>Would to God, that in&s;tead of that fear carried to exce&s;s, the citizens of Philadelphia had imitated the Turks! thus behaving like them towards tho&s;e, would not have abandoned their children, nor the children
<PB N="7" REF="025855_0006_0FCF6C63EDAAB068">their parents, the &s;ervants their ma&s;ters, nor friends each other; but every one would have contributed to comfort and &s;olace one another. The phy&s;icians were frequently compelled, by motives of humanity, to be|come nur&s;es to the &s;ick, who were unable of them|&s;elves to take the medicines. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They have by their flight to the country fully complied with the Latin Di&s;tich,
<Q><L>Hoc tria labificam tollunt adverbia pe&s;tem,</L>
<L>Mox, longe, tarde, code, recode, rodi.</L></Q></NOTE></P>
<P>The&s;e remarks may &s;ound har&s;hly, but they are founded upon my own experience as well as that of &s;everal other phy&s;icians, who, whil&s;t others were argu|ing on the means of pre&s;erving the city from the conta|gion, were courageou&s;ly treading in the path of prac|tice, &s;olicitous to fulfil the &s;acred and religious duties of their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In order to make up as much as in my power lies, for the void left by tho&s;e who have &s;poken of that di&s;|ea&s;e in the public papers, I &s;hall endeavour to expre&s;s my ideas as clearly and preci&s;ely as I can.</P>
<P>I may have mi&s;taken the inductions with which the diagno&s;tic &s;igns of the di&s;ea&s;e have furni&s;hed me. I may al&s;o have mi&s;taken the proximate and di&s;tant cau|&s;es of the pre&s;ent epidemic. But what I am to ad|vance, &s;hall be le&s;s &s;ounded on theory, which often de|ceives, than on practice, and my clinical ob&s;ervations.
<PB N="8" REF="025855_0007_0FCF6C6645B4E060">Thus, I will only &s;ay what I have &s;een or believe my|&s;elf to have &s;een, in my patients. I &s;hall neither ex|aggerate nor di&s;gui&s;e any thing. I only &s;eek for truth, and I write but for the good of humanity, without intending to give my ob&s;ervations for inconte&s;table de|ci&s;ions. Hippocrates has &s;aid of medicine, <HI>Ars longa, oc|ca&s;io celeris, experimentum periculo&s;um, et judicium diffi|cile.</HI> I have, then, no other aim but to &s;timulate my col|leagues, more learned than me, to enlighten the pub|lic. It is our duty likewi&s;e to undeceive the phy&s;icians in other parts of this continent, and of Europe, con|cerning the &s;pecifics recommended in the new&s;papers of North America, which may be very fatal to man|kind.</P>
<P>All epidemics are more or le&s;s contagious. They can be but the effect of a common and univer&s;al cau&s;e: the vitiated nature of aliments, or a derangement of the temperature of the atmo&s;phere, cau&s;e them. If the air is not infected, di&s;ea&s;es cannot be epidemic, and this is &s;o, <HI>indeed,</HI> though it only attacks the natives.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Many circum&s;tances, &s;ays Boerhaave, induce us to believe that the cau&s;es of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es re&s;ide in the air, and depend upon the inexplicable variety of the exhalations therein contained.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>What can be the cau&s;e of that corruption of the air? For what rea&s;on are the natives and tho&s;e inured to the climate of Philadelphia alone infected, with the
<PB N="9" REF="025855_0008_0FCF6C67AC0CD330">prevailing di&s;ea&s;e, whil&s;t foreigners e&s;cape it? they are the fir&s;t &s;ubjects of our enquiry.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer of 1792 was very warm. We were tormented by an amazing number of flies and other in&s;ects, till the middle of November. The following winter was very moderate as to cold, but &s;ubject to &s;urpri&s;ing variations. By various meteorological ob&s;er|vations, it appears that the thermometer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Reaumur's.</HI></NOTE> a&s;cended and de&s;cended from eight to ten degrees in a &s;ingle day. There was almo&s;t a con&s;tant rain, till the end of the Spring, which was very cold, and very damp. There was no hard fro&s;t, and the &s;now had &s;carcely fallen, when it was &s;ucceeded by a thaw. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">According to the ob&s;ervations of Hippocrates,
<Q>when the winter has been too mild, or too cold, when the Spring or Summer, and the following Autumn have been dry, we mu&s;t fear cruel di&s;ea&s;es.</Q>
The mu&s;quitoes were uncommonly numerous during Autumn:
<Q>a certain &s;ign,</Q>
&s;ays Dr. Lind, of an unwhole&s;ome atmo&s;phere.</NOTE> The waters, which, without being frozen, had been &s;tagnant; the quantity of in&s;ects, which winter had killed, the en|trails of the fi&s;h made u&s;e of in the city, ca&s;t by the &s;ide of the Delaware, the rotten &s;kins of the dead animals, and reptiles left near the wharves, or at a &s;hort di&s;|tance from the city, have all certainly contributed to fill the air with putrid and hurtful mia&s;ma. The&s;e added to the quantity of vapours, and of corpu&s;cles of
<PB N="10" REF="025855_0009_0FCF2F2B744C84F0">all kinds with which the atmo&s;phere is always loaded, cannot but rarify or thicken the liquids, affect the &s;o|lids, and derange the animal economy, in the mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ible manner.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>A &s;tench which proceeded from the lakes about two leagues from Montpellier,</Q>
&s;ays Mr. Sauvage, in his No&s;ology,
<Q>produced pe&s;tilen|tial pleuri&s;ies in the neighbouring cities.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the burning heat of this Summer, we have had a &s;mall &s;hare of wind, rain, or thunder &s;ince Spring; and tho&s;e three agents are nece&s;&s;ary to purge the air from the putrid mia&s;ma, and the infectious par|ticles with which it was impregnated. The exhalati|ons continually produced by the rays of the &s;un, from the prodigious number of burying places in Philadel|phia, mu&s;t be &s;ubjoined to the other cau&s;es of infection. To the&s;e we likewi&s;e mu&s;t add the great con&s;umption of meat, &s;alt provi&s;ions, and green fruits; the &s;trong drink, an ill fermented beer, and cyder made of green fruit; we will perceive, I think, in this manner of li|ving of the inhabitants of this country, (notwith&s;tand|ing the conformity of their con&s;titutions to the atmo&s;|phere, of which I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter) that their &s;tomachs were much more di&s;po&s;ed to receive the pu|trid mia&s;mas of the air, than the &s;tomachs of tho&s;e who have ob&s;erved a good regimen, and have been regular in their eating, and &s;ober in their drinking. Let one ob|&s;erve
<PB N="11" REF="025855_0010_0FCF6C6AB4710898">the mo&s;t part of tho&s;e who have been attacked by this di&s;ea&s;e. He will find that &s;even-eighths have been &s;trong per&s;ons, mechanics who had not ob&s;erved any re|gimen, and children, whom green fruits, and an immen&s;e quantity of water melons, and &s;weet potatoes, have cau&s;ed to be attacked by worms, which killed them, without the mo&s;t part of the latter being attacked by any particular fever, either bilious, putrid, or malig|nant. Be&s;ides, we are not ignorant, that every country has its periodical di&s;ea&s;es; that the &s;pring, e|quinox, and &s;ummer, produce a great deal of di&s;order in the animal oeconomy, and that as &s;oon as the air is infected, the character of endemical di&s;ea&s;es is chang|ed, and they become more &s;erious, and mortal. That being once admitted, we &s;hall proceed, to inve&s;tigate the nature of the fever, which the air and &s;o many o|ther cau&s;es have produced, and we &s;hall afterwards examine which are the &s;ure&s;t means of cur|ing it. I do not flatter my&s;elf that I &s;hall analy&s;e the&s;e objects with certainty: phy&s;ic being a &s;cience con|jectural, notwith&s;tanding its own principles, and the ma&s;s of knowledge requi&s;ite for practi&s;ing it.&mdash;I will then only relate the ob&s;ervations which I have made upon a con&s;iderable number of patients, and the infer|ences with which they have &s;upplied me.</P>
<P>Fevers, in general, may be ranked in two cla&s;&s;es: e&s;&s;ential fevers, and &s;ymptomatic fevers. The&s;e take
<PB N="12" REF="025855_0011_0FCF6C6CEE79A8C8">their origin from a local vice, or from another di&s;ea&s;e cau&s;ed by &s;ome accident, or by &s;ome putrid mia&s;ma re|&s;iding in the air; and who&s;e characters vary infinitely, owing as well to the complexion, to the &s;olids and liquids, as to the &s;tomach, to the liver, and final|ly, to the whole hypoga&s;tric region, and abdominals, &amp;c. We &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the e&s;&s;ential fevers pro|ceeding from the fault of the blood and humours alone: which appear to us to have no affinity with the epide|mical di&s;ea&s;es, &s;ince they are the effects of a complica|tion of cau&s;es belonging to the individual.</P>
<P>The reigning fever as far as I have been able to ob|&s;erve it, begins by pains in the loins, and in the head, at fir&s;t light, and afterwards acute, accompanied with chills more or le&s;s con&s;iderable. The face then becomes very red, as well as the eyes, which are filled with tears. Some are delirious from the fir&s;t day of the fever, &s;ome only towards the third day, after which they &s;ink into a &s;tate of weakne&s;s, or into a profound lethargy, from which they never recover. The belly, and <HI>hypocon|dres,</HI> excepting a few pains, are almo&s;t in their natural &s;tate; but the &s;tomach is generally ten&s;e or painful. The tongue, in all ca&s;es, from the beginning to the end, is loaded with a whiti&s;h cru&s;t, and the edges are of a ve|ry high red.</P>
<P>Some have vomitings from the fir&s;t days, others only towards the third or fourth day. The matter which
<PB N="13" REF="025855_0012_0FCF6C6E74ED1668">they then bring up, is whiti&s;h, green or black. Some vomit pure blood. They have a bloody flux, always preceded by bleeding of the no&s;e more or le&s;s con&s;i|derable. Some are thir&s;ty, and others, though their tongue is dry, are not &s;o. The &s;kin is &s;ometimes dry, and &s;hrivelled, and &s;ometimes much covered with &s;weat. But I have not perceived on the &s;kin of any of my patients, any buboes or carbuncles or any other pe&s;tilential eruption. I have ob&s;erved on three per|&s;ons only, &s;ome few red &s;pots, like the bite of a fly, on the &s;tomach or brea&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e &s;pots were &s;o incon&s;iderable, that I doubt whether I may rank them among the petechiae, or milliary eruptions.</NOTE> Many are fatigued and low &s;pirited.</P>
<P>Some have kept their &s;pirits, and have exhibited all the good &s;ymptoms, during four days, till the be|ginning of the fifth, when all is changed, and the pa|tient is de&s;paired of. The urine, as to quantity, is the &s;ame as in a &s;tate of health; as to quality, it is highly coloured, with a great deal of a whiti&s;h &s;ediment. But &s;ome have, towards the beginning of the &s;eventh day, con&s;iderable evacuations of blood.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Among&s;t my patients, I had but one who had an entire &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine during five days. Warm baths and flax&s;eed mucilages were of great &s;ervice to him, and he is now recovered.</NOTE> The pul&s;e, that compa&s;s of phy&s;icians, is here very equivocal. It ne|ver
<PB N="14" REF="025855_0013_0FCF6C701CFC3250">corre&s;ponds with the alarming &s;ymptoms which ac|company the di&s;ea&s;e, excepting the &s;tarting of the ten|dons; and that in a few patients, I have neither found the pul&s;e intermittent, nor altogether obliterated.&mdash; More or le&s;s motion, &s;trength or weakne&s;s was all that I could ob&s;erve; &s;o that, during the time of my attend|ance I regarded, with more attention, the other &s;igns, than the &s;tate of the pul&s;e. In that variety of &s;ymp|toms, the patients die on the &s;econd, third, fifth, &s;e|venth, or ninth day, of the di&s;ea&s;e; and notwith&s;tand|ing the ob&s;ervation of tho&s;e critical days, &s;everal have elap&s;ed without having any &s;en&s;ible cri&s;is, whereby nature could drive away the di&s;ea&s;e. They recovered in proportion as the alarming &s;ymptoms cea&s;ed, which happens very &s;eldom in acute di&s;ea&s;es. Some women, attacked with that fever during their men&s;es, had them &s;uddenly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and children &s;ometimes pa&s;&s;ed up and down a great quantity of worms, for the mo&s;t part very red. In the critical days, the hiccup torments the patients in a mo&s;t cruel manner, and then the eyes and &s;kin of &s;ome become yellowi&s;h. Several patients who &s;pate or vomited blood, bled at the no&s;e, evacuated a brown matter, and were tor|mented with the hiccup, did however recover, not|with&s;tanding tho&s;e alarming &s;igns, which together with the other &s;ymptoms, announced the approach of death. But tho&s;e who vomited a black matter, who pi&s;&s;ed blood, who were heavy and &s;leepy, who became
<PB N="15" REF="025855_0014_0FCF6C718122B9C8">yellow before the &s;eventh day, or who&s;e &s;tomach was much &s;welled, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e, made any u&s;e of cathartics, died be|tween the fifth and eighth day.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is well known that purgatives do not act only upon the &s;tomach and inte&s;tinal canal, but their action is communicated to the liver, the pancreas, and the &s;pleen.</NOTE></P>
<P>Tho&s;e are the ob&s;ervations, I have made on my pa|tients, who&s;e different &s;ituations I have &s;tudied with the mo&s;t &s;teady application.</P>
<P>What is then this fever? Is it the &s;weating &s;ickne&s;s, the putrid bilious fever, the inflammatory fever, or the di&s;ea&s;e of Siam, or the malignant fever?&mdash;I do not know; but I am convinced, that it unites in it&s;elf almo&s;t e|very characteri&s;tic &s;ign of the&s;e diver&s;e fevers. Be&s;ides, it di&s;gui&s;es it&s;elf, varies and a&s;&s;umes &s;o many different a&s;pects, according to the complexion and con&s;titution of the patient, the &s;tate of the ma&s;s of blood and humours, the di&s;ea&s;es, which he was &s;ubject to, when he was attacked with that fever, and &s;till much more than it is &s;uppo&s;ed, to the tranquility and agitation of his mind, that all judgment, and even inductions, upon its particular character, are liable to error.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s it appears that it is produced by one
<PB N="16" REF="025855_0015_0FCF6C72F6469B88">and the &s;ame cau&s;e: that it &s;hews the cau&s;e of its own principle, and is only derived from an inflamma|tion, which the mia&s;mas of the air, combined with the di&s;po&s;itions of the body, produce an inflammation in the epi&s;gra&s;tic region, which affects the liver and the hypocondria in &s;uch a manner, that the blood, the bile, and other humours acquire more fluidity, owing to the heat increa&s;ing the dilatation of the ve&s;&s;els, cau&s;ing a di&s;&s;olution of the blood and of the humours, which are the principal characters with which the fever in que&s;|tion is accompanied. Pains in the &s;tomach and reins, the fir&s;t &s;igns of this di&s;ea&s;e, are &s;ucceeded by the pathagnomic &s;igns, as well as by vomitings and pi&s;&s;ing of blood; and it is certain, that all which can pro|duce the ga&s;tritis, of which the &s;everal &s;pecies have been de&s;cribed by Sauvage and Hoffman, and e&s;pecially dra&s;tic cathartics, &s;trong emeticks, and all that in|crea&s;e the fluidity of the humours, &s;uch as mercury, &amp;c. are not only contrary to the treatment of the di&s;|ea&s;e, but may occa&s;ion certain death. And how many &s;ince it prevails have been victims of the violent treat|ment, and pretended &s;pecifics?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is true that Mr. Ro&s;en&s;ten, a celebrated Swedi&s;h phy&s;ician, pre&s;cribed calomel with camphor and aloes, as a pre&s;ervative again&s;t the &s;mall pox, a di&s;ea&s;e well marked. But who is yet acquainted with the nature of an epidemic, &s;o as to pre&s;cribe pre&s;ervatives in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e? Be&s;ides mercury di&s;&s;olves the blood, and above all the other humours. It is then, contrary and dangerous, for all that has a tendency to di&s;&s;olution, and con&s;equently in the prevailing di&s;ea&s;e. Let the bodies of tho&s;e who die of that di&s;ea&s;e be opened, it will be found that the lower part of the belly, and all the epigra&s;tic are the only ones af|fected, while the heart and the brains are in their natural &s;tate. Be|&s;ides, let the dead bodies of tho&s;e who u&s;ed mercury and cathartics, be examined, and it will appear, whether in the&s;e, the evil has not been en|crea&s;ed and whether the gangrenous &s;pots do not vi&s;ibly di&s;cover the vio|lent irritations cau&s;ed by tho&s;e corro&s;ive medicines. The philo&s;ophical &s;tone of phy&s;ic, the univer&s;al panacea, is not yet di&s;covered, and were it a|mong&s;t po&s;&s;ible things, one may well be allowed to doubt that Heaven had only re&s;erved that di&s;covery to the phy&s;icians of this part of the globe.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="025855_0016_0FCF6C746F1C7490">The re&s;ult of all that I have &s;aid is that in the cure of this di&s;ea&s;e, no regular &s;y&s;tem can be followed.&mdash; Therefore, I followed none, nor have I adopted any one medicine in preference to another.

<PB N="18" REF="025855_0017_0FCF6C779657AE48">the means u&s;ed in vain to cure them, confirms me more and more in the re&s;olution I have taken to fol|low that practice.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I have vi&s;ited and attended during the cour&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e, that is to &s;ay, &s;ince the 28th Augu&s;t to this day, more than 160 patients, of whom 117 were really attacked with the fever, which it would be diffi|cult to call by a very characteri&s;tic name. Of that number I had the misfortune to lo&s;e 19. To eleven of the&s;e I was only &s;ent for on the 2d, 4th or 5th day after they were taken ill, after they had been treated by other phy&s;icians, after they had taken violent vomits, cathartics, tincture of bark, with liq. laud. as they them&s;elves informed me. Every one complained of beating pains on their &s;tomach already much &s;welled.&mdash; Eight others who &s;ent for me in the beginning of this &s;ickne&s;s, had on the &s;econd or third day of my treatment, con&s;iderable vomitings of a black matter, the jaundice, pi&s;&s;ed blood, and died on the 4th, 5th, 7th or 9th day.</P>
<P>I do not mention other patients whom I have vi&s;ited and treated during that time the number of which exceeds fifty. Many had but little remittent, or colliquative fever. A greater number were affected more in mind than body, having con&s;ulted me, the more I attributed their unea&s;y &s;ituation to the fear they were &s;eized with, and the more that I a&s;&s;ured them they were not &s;ick, the le&s;s they believed me. I was obliged in order to cure them, to make u&s;e of an innocent &s;trata|gem, by giving them &s;ome agreeable potions concealed under the di&s;|gu&s;ting appearance of medicines; and though they were only made with a few grains of cooling powders of &s;tahl, they operated on them, by the merit of per&s;ua&s;ion, by re&s;toring to them the tranquility of mind they had lo&s;t.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="025855_0018_0FCF6C78EDA34DC8">As &s;oon as I was called to vi&s;it a patient, and as &s;oon as I perceived the lea&s;t &s;ign of inflammation, I, fir&s;t of all, ordered him to be bled once or twice, and regula|ted the quantity of blood to be let, according to his age, and the &s;trength of his con&s;titution. If it was the fir&s;t day of the &s;ickne&s;s, and the inflammation was not likely to be of con&s;equence, and if the patient in|clined much to vomiting, I admini&s;tered to him either a vomit in a large quantity of water, or &s;ome purgative of &s;enna, manna, cream of tartar, and &s;alt of &s;eignette to clean&s;e the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages. If he complained of a head ach, which did not le&s;&s;en, or if the inflammation be|gan, I pre&s;cribed bleeding after the purgatives<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">None of my patients were bled more than twice, and they lo&s;t but 6 or 8 ounces of blood at a time. My well grounded fear of the di&s;&s;o|lution of the blood, made me to be very cautious about bleeding, which I pre&s;cribed but in ca&s;e of need, and according to the &s;igns I perceived in my patients. Thus many recovered without having been bled.</NOTE>, and during that time until the third day, I only pre&s;cribed plentiful and cooling drinks, and in proportion as the &s;trength failed, or I &s;u&s;pected a beginning of di&s;&s;olu|tion in the humours, I did not &s;pare cordials, or the mo&s;t &s;oftening a&s;tringents, mixed with mucilages and antiphlogi&s;tics; not forgetting, when occa&s;ion requi|red, anti&s;eptics, for which I u&s;ed the alexipharmic e&s;&s;ence of &s;tahl, and the camphoric tincture of be&s;oard; I al&s;o pre&s;cribed bli&s;ters, when I perceived the lea&s;t
<PB N="20" REF="025855_0019_0FCF6C7A7056F060">&s;ign of &s;leepine&s;s. I have never purged any patient, excepting tho&s;e who took phy&s;ic on the fir&s;t day; but about the &s;ixth day of his illne&s;s, or when I perceived, by his urine, that the coction was made, I never u&s;ed bark, which I look upon rather as a good &s;trengthen|er than as an antiputrid, before the di&s;ea&s;e is abating. As to children, all I pre&s;cribed for them was bermifu|ges and gly&s;ters made of milk and honey, and every one evacuated a con&s;iderable quantity of reddi&s;h worms.</P>
<P>Among&s;t all the melancholy &s;ymptoms of this cruel di&s;ea&s;e, I found none &s;o difficult to calm as vomitings, and hiccup. Acids compo&s;ed of dulcified marine, and vitriolic &s;alt, had but little &s;ucce&s;s. I &s;ucceeded much better, as well again&s;t continual vomitings as again&s;t bloody evacuations, with a &s;trong mucilage made of flax-&s;eed, gum-arabic, honey, and cinnamon water, of which I directed my patients to take a &s;poonful every ten minutes.</P>
<P>Topics of emollient herbs boiled in &s;trong wine, vinegar applied warm on the &s;tomach, the lower part of the belly, and the reins, have al&s;o been of great &s;ervice with me again&s;t the pains of tho&s;e parts. I u&s;ed no narcotics. If the patient, when the di&s;ea&s;e abated, was tormented with a want of &s;leep, I only admini&s;tered to him almond-juice very thick, mixed
<PB N="21" REF="025855_0020_0FCF6C7BEF680068">with diacodium. In fine, my whole treatment was at fir&s;t only e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the inflammation, which I always believed to be the origin of that di&s;ea&s;e, and afterwards on the di&s;&s;olution of humors which follow|ed; and therefore I made the application according to circum&s;tances, and the different &s;hapes in which the di&s;ea&s;e pre&s;ented it&s;elf, and of the be&s;t advices given us by the mo&s;t eminent authors who have written on phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>But is, or is not this di&s;ea&s;e contagious? A que&s;tion which I think I am only able to an&s;wer by a di&s;tinc|tion, which experience &s;eems to ju&s;tify. It is contagi|ous for tho&s;e, who&s;e organical con&s;titution has great homogenity with the air of this country. The affinity and relation exi&s;ting between their con&s;titution, and the impre&s;&s;ion of this atmo&s;phere, gives them a near|er di&s;po&s;ition to receive the impre&s;&s;ions of the putrid mia&s;mas, with which the air is impregnated, and which alter and trouble, more, or le&s;s that equilibrium of the &s;olids and liquids, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to maintain good health. The di&s;ea&s;e is not contagious for foreigners, who&s;e con&s;titutions have little homogenity with that dry air. We are convinced of it by the prodigious num|bers abounding in this city, none of whom were at|tacked with that di&s;ea&s;e, whil&s;t the mo&s;t part of the natives, and tho&s;e u&s;ed to the climate, were taken ill with it.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="025855_0021_0FCF6C7D6DFC9928">The relations of man with all that &s;urrounds him, and the influence of the air on the con&s;titutions, can|not be de&s;cribed. We &s;ee the effects of them without often being able to penetrate the cau&s;es. We can give but conjectures on that head; and I only ground this, upon this certain fact, that men accu&s;tomed to a climate, are much more &s;ubject to the hurtful variati|ons and influences of its atmo&s;phere, than tho&s;e, who&s;e complexion, through a phy&s;ical propen&s;ity, is &s;till &s;ubject to the nature of the climate that they have ju&s;t quit|ted. From thence ari&s;e endemic di&s;ea&s;es, which do not affect foreigners, and from thence al&s;o the peculiar di&s;ea&s;es which attack new-comers, without affecting the natives, as experience has often &s;hewed to us in our colonies.</P>
<P>Such are, in a few words, what I have ob&s;erved in this di&s;ea&s;e, and the methods I have followed to cure it. This is what the little lei&s;ure, left me by my patients, could allow me to commit ha&s;tily to writing. The public will not, certainly, find, in my &s;tyle, any thing to make amends for the dryne&s;s of the &s;ubject I am wri|ting upon.

<HEAD>POSTCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>Whil&s;t this paper was in the hands of one of my friends, who had undertaken to tran&s;late it into En|gli&s;h, and print it, I had an opportunity of vi&s;iting the new a&s;ylum of the unfortunate, at Bu&s;h-hill. For this favour, I was indebted to Mr. Deve&s;e, a phy&s;ician and &s;urgeon from, St. Domingo, who, by a happy choice, has been entru&s;ted with the care and direction of the ho&s;pital at Bu&s;h-hill; and who, to a feeling heart, u|nites the knowledge requi&s;ite for doing honour to his two profe&s;&s;ions. At my reque&s;t, he was kind enough to have opened, in my pre&s;ence, the bodies of two pa|tients, who had died of the reigning di&s;ea&s;e. Of the&s;e two, the one had, before he came to the ho&s;pital, made u&s;e of the dra&s;tic purges with mercury, and the other had been treated in a more mild manner. The anatomical in&s;pection of the&s;e two bodies, and of &s;eve|ral others, made in the &s;ame ho&s;pital, has confirmed, in a mo&s;t incontrovertible manner, the truth of what I have advanced, in one of my notes (P. 31,) and have plainly proved the havoc that tho&s;e violent medicines, when admini&s;tered in an inflammatory &s;ickne&s;s, have cau&s;ed in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, the effects where|of were perceived upon the bodies of other patients who died of that di&s;order, although treated in a differ|ent manner. Therefore if the <HI>virus</HI> of that epidemi|cal di&s;ea&s;e, yields, but with difficulty, to the cool anti|phlogi&s;tic method, much more will it de&s;troy the pa|tient,
<PB N="25" REF="025855_0024_0FCF6C81EEF0E820">in a &s;till &s;horter time, if, with the intention of oppo&s;ing it, we augment its violence by medicines ana|logous to its de&s;tructive nature.</P>
<P>How much that new ho&s;pital has penetrated my heart with gladne&s;s! The &s;ituation, the cleanne&s;s, the neatne&s;s that reign in every room, the contented and &s;atisfied looks of the patients, who &s;eem to ble&s;s their benefactors from the bottom of their hearts; the vigilance, the activity of the French under-&s;urgeons, American nur&s;es, and others whom I found there; the obliging and &s;olacing manner in which they &s;peak to the patients; in a word, every circum&s;tance has moved my &s;en&s;ibility, in &s;uch a way, as to &s;hed tears. Without prodigality, there is nothing wa&s;ted in that ho&s;pital. The mo&s;t valuable medicines, the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite wines, the nice&s;t and mo&s;t &s;uitable diet, in &s;hort, every thing is in abun|dances, and every thing is de&s;tined for the relief of tho&s;e unhappy and devoted per&s;ons, whom the epide|mic has &s;truck with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> blow.</P>
<P>If the peace and tranquility, which are enjoyed in this country, enchant the &s;oul of the meek and peaceful man, the charity of the American people towards their poor, the eager cares with which &s;ome humane and ge|nerous per&s;ons, have, in a &s;hort time, and at their own expence, fitted up this new a&s;ylum for &s;uffering huma|nity, the a&s;&s;iduity and zeal of the committee that &s;u|perintend it, all this may edify the mo&s;t virtuous peo|ple on earth, and give an example to the univer&s;e how

This pic|ture, &s;o comforting for humanity, mu&s;t and ought to &s;pread joy, in a heart of &s;en&s;ibility, and make one &s;ay with tran&s;port,
