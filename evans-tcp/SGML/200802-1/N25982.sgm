<P N="1">I. A REMEMBRANCE of the &s;tate of death we once were in, may be as a warning to beware of returning thither again. What bondage we were in when we were &s;laves to &s;in&mdash;upon the road to hell! Then we loved &s;in, but now we profe&s;s to hate it. Forget not, O my &s;oul, the wormwood and the gall; remember what trouble and di&s;tre&s;s &s;in brought upon thee, under which &s;oul and body mu&s;t have &s;unk forever, were it not for the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS. I charge thee O my &s;oul, to beware of &s;in&mdash;for&s;ake the city of de&s;truc|tion&mdash;flee to the mountain&mdash;tarry not in all the plain, le&s;t thou be con&s;umed. Oh, may I never be &s;o amazing fooli&s;h, as to ca&s;t off the ea&s;y yoke of the lovely JESUS, and to be again entangled with the yoke of bondage.</P>
<L>Oh! What a wretched &s;tate of &s;in,</L>
<L>What clouds of darkne&s;s I was in&mdash;</L>
<L>By nature all undone:</L>
<L>But Oh! The rich and wond'rous love,</L>
<L>That comes &s;o &s;weetly from above,</L>
<L>Thro' GOD's beloved SON!</L>
<P N="2"><PB N="4" REF="034555_0004_0FFE276048F28AE8">II. THE wonderous way that our &s;ouls are delivered from our death &s;tate &s;hould be a &s;trong motive to engage us to live to the glo|ry of GOD. Behold the LAMB of GOD, O my &s;oul! Take a view of what this lovely Being underwent to redeem thee, not only from mi&s;|ery, but al&s;o from &s;in. He was a man of &s;or|rows, and acquainted with grief, while he lived on earth, not for his own &s;ins, for he was per|fectly pure; but he was wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. Oh! What di&s;tre&s;s JESUS un|derwent, when being in an agony, he prayed more earne&s;tly, and his &s;weat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground.&mdash; Oh! Is not this enough to excite me to pro|claim eternal war again&s;t &s;in? Can I hug the &s;erpent in my bo&s;om, that cau&s;ed the Beauty of Heaven to be covered with blood? That cau&s;ed the ble&s;&s;ed Sun of glory to be eclip&s;ed for a &s;ea&s;on? Oh! What &s;orrows he under|went in the garden, when he &s;aid, <HI>My &s;oul is exceeding &s;orrowful, even unto death!</HI> Was there no mortal then to watch with the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS in this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing hour? Could not his own di&s;ciples, for who&s;e &s;ake he was &s;uffering, have &s;o much of a &s;ympathy with him in his di&s;tre&s;s, as to keep awake one hour, when he bid them watch with him? No&mdash;this ble&s;&s;ed ONE mu&s;t bear the weight of his people's &s;ins alone&mdash; none was able or willing to help&punc; Who can conceive what he underwent in the garden! But that was not all; he mu&s;t &s;uffer va&s;tly

more before he could &s;ay, <HI>It is fini&s;hed.</HI> Be|hold the &s;uffering JESUS&mdash;His &s;oul was ex|ceeding &s;orrowful, even unto death, to redeem my poor &s;oul from eternal death! His ble&s;&s;ed innocent body was al&s;o tormented, even unto death, to &s;ave my poor body from the power of death. Can I bear to behold by faith, how tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed hands and feet were nailed to the cro&s;s, until &s;in and &s;inners tormented the SON of GOD to death. Oh! Amazing love and pity! Did the King of Glory undergo all this, and va&s;tly more than I can conceive, to redeem my &s;oul and body from &s;in and death, and &s;hall not the &s;oul and body thus redeemed, be entirely at his command? Surely the &s;en&s;e of the&s;e things, will make every &s;oul that loves GOD, hate &s;in. Am I bought with &s;uch a price, and &s;hall I not glorify GOD with my body and &s;pirit, which are his?</P>
<L>Can I believe that CHRIST did die,</L>
<L>To ran&s;om &s;uch a worm as I,</L>
<L>From everla&s;ting death &mdash;</L>
<L>And not re&s;olve to &s;pend my days</L>
<L>In &s;howing forth my SAVIOUR's prai&s;e,</L>

the ran&s;omed of the LORD &s;hall walk, until they come to Mount Zion with &s;ongs, and everla&s;ting joy &s;hall be upon their heads. Doth our kind LORD give &s;o many &s;weet coun|&s;els and loving invitations to us, unworthy &s;inners, to walk in his plea&s;ant ways, and &s;hall we take no heed to walk in the law of the LORD, with all our heart? Take heed, O my &s;oul, le&s;t thou &s;in again&s;t pure love and &s;weet compa&s;&s;ion. There is no way good or plea&s;|ant but that which our ble&s;&s;ed REDEEMER walked in. Great peace have they who love his law, and nothing &s;hall offend them. Oh! What peace and joy we have found in obedi|ence to the commands of GOD! What can be more fooli&s;h than for a &s;oul to leave this bright and &s;hining way that leads to eternal glory, and turn a&s;ide after poor toys, that are good for nothing, among briers and thorns, dragons, lions, and &s;erpents, and all manner of dangers, with the hazard of lo&s;ing heaven and obtain|ing hell? Sweet promi&s;es and rich ble&s;&s;ings, are &s;trewed like ro&s;es under our feet, all along the way to glory: But threatenings and cur&s;es are &s;cattered in all other paths. Godline&s;s is profitable unto all things, having the promi&s;es of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. None can tell the advantage and prof|it the honour and plea&s;ure, the beauty and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ory, of living a holy and religious life!&mdash; Godline&s;s draws all the ble&s;&s;ings, and ungod|line&s;s draws all the cur&s;es in the Bible.</P>
<L><PB N="7" REF="034555_0007_0FFE2729C45B72B0">
O happy &s;ouls, that walk with GOD,</L>
<L>And keep the bright and &s;hining road,</L>
<L>That leads to Paradi&s;e;</L>
<L>No trouble can their peace de&s;troy,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t marching on to endle&s;s joy,</L>
<L>To &s;ee their lovely CHRIST!</L>
<P N="4">IV. THE danger of going back from a good beginning &s;hould make us afraid to &s;in again&s;t GOD, and &s;hun every temptation that would entice us to depart from the LORD.&mdash; We mu&s;t not &s;o much as look back with a de&s;ire after any &s;inful plea&s;ure; for the LORD JESUS &s;ays, "<HI>He that putteth his hand to the plough, and looketh back, is not fit for the king|dom of heaven.</HI>" Take heed, O my &s;oul, and beware of a &s;inful look. Let us remember Lot's wife; &s;he looked back after &s;he had &s;et out to leave Sodom, and behold &s;he is turned into a pillar of &s;alt, to &s;tand as a warning to all generations! May all profe&s;&s;ors take no|tice, and when once &s;et out for Mount Zion, never look back with any de&s;ire after what we have left in Sodom. If it is &s;o dangerous to look back, what will be the fate of tho&s;e who not only look, but draw back unto per|dition? Hear what the King of Glory &s;ays&mdash; "<HI>If any man draw back, my &s;oul &s;hall have no plea&s;ure in him.</HI>" Oh! What a &s;olemn warn|ing is this! Can I be &s;o hardened and de|ceived by the flatteries of &s;in, as to face all the threatenings in the Bible, rather than face a
<PB N="8" REF="034555_0008_0FFE276647312408">
vain world? Don't I fear the wrath and di&s;plea&s;|ure of the Almighty King of heaven and earth, &s;o much as the frowns of a few earth worms? It is not only dangerous, but it is hard going back &mdash;the way of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors is hard. It is a way of death, and of darkne&s;s wherein is no plea&s;ure. Our experience tells us we find no peace in departing from the Prince of Peace. Tho' &s;in may deceive us with a vain hope of finding &s;atisfaction in pur&s;uing &s;omething be&s;ides GOD, yet we &s;hall find all the &s;weets of &s;in, bitter as wormwood, as un&s;atisfying as gravel or a&s;hes, and as unwhole&s;ome as the wor&s;t of poi&s;on.&mdash; If our &s;chemes &s;eem to pro&s;per in a way of &s;in, yet we &s;hall find that the turning away of the &s;imple &s;hall &s;lay them, and the pro&s;perity of tools &s;hall de&s;troy them. If the Lord gives us our carnal de&s;ires while we depart from him, he will &s;end leanne&s;s into our &s;ouls. There is no plea&s;ure nor &s;afety but in living near to GOD.</P>
<L>Then O my &s;oul, beware of &s;in:</L>
<L>LORD make and keep me pure within&mdash;</L>
<L>Oh! May I walk with Thee!</L>
<L>And never rove, nor go a&s;tray,</L>
<L>But walk in CHRIST, my glorious way,</L>
<L>Until thy face I &s;ee.</L>
<P N="5">V. IF we have any love to the &s;aints, or pity to poor &s;inners, let us take heed to walk like true chri&s;tians. Can I bear to wound
<PB N="9" REF="034555_0009_0FFE272E1F878498">
the lovely Saviour, and thereby wound the hearts of tho&s;e who love him? Did the dear &s;aints rejoice to &s;ee me make a good profe&s;|&s;ion, and now &s;hall their &s;ouls mourn for my falling away? Shall I be a child that cau&s;es &s;hame and &s;orrow? Mu&s;t I be a blot and a a di&s;honour to the royal family of King JESUS? Oh! May I never bring a reproach upon re|ligion, and grieve the excellent ones of the earth. May I bear &s;o much of the image of the lovely JESUS, that tho&s;e who love JESUS may be glad when they &s;ee me! Oh, may we &s;it together in heavenly places in CHRIST JE|SUS! It is not only wounding to the &s;aints, but cruelty to tho&s;e that never knew the way of peace, for tho&s;e who profe&s;s to be follow|ers of the LAMB of GOD, to walk di&s;agreeable to their profe&s;&s;ion. Can I bear to help the &s;inner down to to hell? Shall I, by my evil example, or vain conver&s;ation, be the means of binding the precious &s;ouls of my dear friends down to everla&s;ting death, and yet expect my|&s;elf to obtain everla&s;ting life? If my conver|&s;ation is in heaven, I may, by the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, be the means of &s;aving &s;ouls from death, and of turning many to righteou&s;ne&s;s, and have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them eternally &s;hining in glory: But if I join with &s;inners, and walk with them in the ways of &s;in, perhaps I &s;hall be the means of their going to eternal mi&s;ery &mdash;like tho&s;e who would not enter into the kingdom of heaven them&s;elves, and tho&s;e that
<PB N="10" REF="034555_0010_0FFE2767DFF06828">
would enter in they hindered. Time is &s;hort &mdash;Have I one moment to wa&s;te? A long e|ternity of joy or &s;orrow will &s;oon be my a|bode, and the abode of all my friends on earth.</P>
<L>Saints &s;hould not like the &s;inners walk,</L>
<L>Nor join with them in fooli&s;h talk,</L>
<L>Or any &s;inful way:</L>
<L>We that profe&s;s the SAVIOUR's Name,</L>
<L>Should make his prai&s;es all our theme,</L>
<L>While in this world we &s;tay.</L>
<P N="6">VI. SINCE it is revealed by the Scriptures, that the angels of GOD are &s;ent forth to mini&s;ter to tho&s;e who &s;hall be heirs of &s;alvation, this puts us under great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">gration to &s;ee that we &s;pend all our time in the &s;ervice of GOD. What wonderful ble&s;&s;ings GOD be&s;tows on unworthy &s;inners! He gave his beloved SON to die, who ever lives to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">erce&s;&s;ion for us; and he &s;ends his angels to guard us through this dangerous world. Be|ware of &s;in, O my &s;oul! Shall the angels who rejoice to &s;ee &s;inners repent, wait upon me, while I &s;in again&s;t their King? Oh, that I could live in &s;uch a manner as to be a delight to the LORD, to angels and to &s;aints. I be|lieve it adds to their joy in heaven, to have &s;ongs of prai&s;e a&s;cend from &s;ouls on earth.</P>
<L>My &s;oul, come join the ho&s;t above,</L>
<L>Who&s;e tongues are fired with &s;acred love,</L>
<L>The SAVIOUR's Name to ble&s;s:</L>

<L>While they conduct my feet along.</L>
<L>Thro' this dark wilderne&s;s&punc;</L>
<P N="7">VII. THE glory of GOD, above all things, &s;hould be a motive to engage my &s;oul to keep his commandments. GOD is glorified in tho&s;e happy &s;ouls who walk with him, and bear much fruit to his glory; &s;uch &s;ouls hon|our the LORD, but tho&s;e who for&s;ake his ways de&s;pi&s;e him. No tongue can tell what an hon|our, and what a ble&s;&s;ing it is for a mortal creature to be u&s;ed as an in&s;trument for the advancement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he declarative glory of the GOD of glory and to be a worker together with GOD. Ble&s;&s;ed are tho&s;e who e&s;teem the glory of GOD more precious than their lives. It appears to me that all things were pointing to tho&s;e who have ta&s;ted the love of JESUS, and &s;ome way or other telling them to live to the glory of GOD. The Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, one e&s;&s;ential God of pure love; &s;tands inviting all his children to live near to him and be happy. All the pearly gates of heaven, with all the bright inhabitants of glory &s;tand invit|ing, &s;aying, <HI>Come up hither, live near to</HI> GOD, <HI>and be eternally happy.</HI> All the &s;weet promi&s;es in the Bible &s;tand inviting, &s;aying, <HI>Come, eat ye that which is good, and let your &s;oul delight it&s;elf in fatne&s;s live near to</HI> GOD <HI>and be happy.</HI> All the &s;aints on earth, who live in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the love of GOD, &s;tand inviting, &s;aying, <HI>Oh, ta&s;te
