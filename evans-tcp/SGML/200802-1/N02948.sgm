<P>GOD is the Supream Lord &amp; Ruler of the world, and Governs it ac|cording to his own eternal Coun|&s;els, wherein he is ab&s;olutely free and Sovereign, and though in all his decrees and di&s;pen&s;ations he acts in infinite Wi&s;dom, &amp; according to the &s;potl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s Purity, &amp; glori|ous Holine&s;s of his own mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Nature, and the Rules of the mo&s;t perfect Equity and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, yet in &s;ome of them he is not only to high for the mo&s;t &s;oaring thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hts of the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;t &amp; mo&s;t knowing men, and too deep for the reach of the longe&s;t line of hu|mane Under&s;tanding, but al&s;o very cro&s;s &amp; contrary to the natural inclinations of men; e&s;pecially while in their fallen and depraved State, And in particular he is &s;o in the things mentioned in our Text For the opening of which &s;everal things may be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="2" REF="003534_0005_0FF859E953A35FD0">1. An Appointment or Decree of God, in the&s;e words, <HI>It is appointed,</HI> that is by God: He is the author of this decree; this is im|plied here, and abundantly expre&s;&s;ed el&s;e|where in the holy Scripture.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Objects of this decree, and they
are <HI>Men.</HI> It is appointed <HI>for men.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Extent of this decree with re&s;pect to the Objects of it, and that is noted by this word <HI>All.</HI> It extends to all men; the decree with re&s;pect to the Object of it is of univer&s;al extent.</P>
<P N="4">4. The things contain'd in this decree or appointment of God, and they are two, <HI>viz, Death</HI> and <HI>Judgment.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>Death It is appointed for all men to die.</HI> And here we may ob&s;erve the Limitation of this, namely of mens dying, by the Divine decree as to time; as God hath appointed that all men mu&s;t die, &s;o he hath Limited their dying to one time, they mu&s;t die but once. There have been two men &s;ince the world began that never died, <HI>viz. Enoch</HI> &amp; <HI>Elijah</HI> And they al&s;o that will be alive when Chri&s;t comes to Judge the world (as &s;eems plain from Scripture will not die; And &s;ome of the lead that were rai&s;ed to life by Chri&s;t &amp; his Apo&s;tles, &amp; by &s;ome of the Prophets, might (for ought that we know) die a se|cond time; but in all Ages &amp; Generations of

men (those mention'd only excepted) we have rea&s;on to conclude that all have died &amp; mu&s;t die, &amp; that but once. This &s;eems to be the decree of Heaven: this is the appoint|ment of the great Sovereign of the world concerning men.</P>
<P N="2">(2) The &s;econd thing mentioned in the decree of God concerning men is, <HI>that they &s;hall go to Judgment.</HI> Now men are favour'd with a time of Patience &amp; a day of Grace; but a day of Judgment is coming, wherein they mu&s;t receive a Judicial Sentence from God their Judge, and be di&s;pos'd of by him acccording to the Rules of &s;trict Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="5">5. The la&s;t thing I &s;hall Ob&s;erve in the Text, is, the time of this Judgment, &amp; that is, <HI>after Death.</HI> It is appointed for all men once to die, &amp; <HI>after this the Judgment.</HI> What is further needful for the Opening of the words, may be left to the Explication of the Doctrine, which is this, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>DOCT. The Time is coming when all Per&s;ons now Living, mu&s;t &s;urely Die &amp; go to Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>In many things men in this life do greatly differ, and that both in temporal &amp; &s;piritual re&s;pects, but there is one thing wherein they all agree: Men of all ranks &amp; degrees, of all kinds &amp; qualifications do agree in this, that they are mortal &amp; mu&s;t die.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003534_0007_0FF859EDDAA98BD8">And as men greatly differ in their &s;tate &amp; condition during this pre&s;ent life (I mean e&s;pecially while health is continu'd to 'em) &s;o they do in the manner of their dying. Thus it is both as to godly &amp; wicked men. Some that have liv'd a truly godly life &s;ay but little when they come to die; others &s;ay much, &amp; that to the great comfort of their friends about them&punc; Some godly per&s;ons die with but a &s;upporting hope, others die with a triumphant joy; &amp; &s;ome of the dear chil|dren of God have (without doubt) died in the dark.</P>
<P>The death of wicked men al&s;o is attended with very differing circum&s;tances; &s;ome of them die in the &s;ame carnal &s;ecurity &amp; &s;en&s;e|le&s;s &s;tupidity in which they all along liv'd, <HI>Job</HI> 21.23 Others die as with a guilty, &s;o with an awakenend &amp; accu&s;ing Con&s;cience. Some die under delu&s;ions &amp; with fal&s;e hopes, and in others their hope is as the giving up of the gho&s;t. <HI>Job</HI> 11.20. Terrors are upon them, yea they take hold of them as waters. <HI>Job</HI> 27.20. They are in great di&s;tre&s;s upon their death-beds, they die in the bitterne&s;s of their souls, <HI>Job</HI> 21 25. Yea, it hath been the dole|ful ca&s;e of &s;ome that have liv'd wicked lives to go out of the world de&s;pairing of mercy. Thus greatly do &s;ome men differ from o|thers in the circum&s;tances that their death
<PB N="5" REF="003534_0008_0FF859EF6FCA2568">
is attended with &amp; that both of the godly &amp; of the wicked, but in this they all agree, that they come to their end, their breath goeth forth, they return to their du&s;t, their &s;ouls go into Eternity, their bodies go to the grave, to the hou&s;e appointed for all living, they enter into the &s;tate of the dead, and there they take up their lodging, lying and &s;leeping in &s;ilence in the dark chambers of death, and have no more a portion for ever in any thing done under the Sun.</P>
<P>And as there is a great difference between &s;ome men &amp; others at their death, or in the manner of their dying, &s;o there is &s;till a far greater difference in their &s;tate after death.</P>
<P>Men don't all go to heaven when they die, neither do they all go to hell: &s;ome go one way &amp; &s;ome another. Some go to everla&s;t|ing re&s;t joy &amp; glory, others to endle&s;s de&s;|pair, wo &amp; mi&s;ery: but in this they agree that they all go to Judgment.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrinal</HI> handling of this truth may come under the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1 There is a time coming when all the living mu&s;t &s;urely die. 2. God hath made it to be the duty of men, to &s;pend their appointed time in the world in the &s;ervice &amp; to the glory of their Maker. 3. God hath appointed a time, wherein he will call men to an account how they have acted in their places, &amp; how they have &s;pent their time in the world.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="003534_0009_0FF859F1A0901710">I. <HI>There is a time coming when all the living mu&s;t &s;urely die.</HI> All the living have &s;inn'd a|gain&s;t God, the God that created them &amp; all the world, &amp; therefore they mu&s;t die. God at fir&s;t made man in a &s;tate of innocency &amp; integrity, &amp; had he continu'd in that &s;tate du|ring the time of his probation, God would have &s;etled &amp; confirm'd him in a happy Im|mortality; but our fir&s;t Father, the fir&s;t man that God created, by di&s;obedience to his Ma|ker, fell from his fir&s;t e&s;tate, &amp; being con&s;ti|tuted by God to be the publick Head &amp; Re|pre&s;entative of all that &s;hould by ordinary Generation de&s;cend from him, all mankind &s;inned in him.</P>
<P><HI>And then again,</HI> All are &s;inners by their own inherent corruption, P&s;. 51.5 <HI>Behold, I was &s;ha|pen in &s;in, &amp; in iniquity did my mother conceive me</HI> Job 25.4. <HI>How can man be ju&s;tified with God, or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?</HI> And all that live to be capable of it, are &s;in|ners by actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, Eccl. 7.20. <HI>There is not a ju&s;t man upon earth that doth good &amp; &s;inneth not.</HI> And therefore all the living mu&s;t die. Man hath made him&s;elf a &s;inful creature, and therefore God hath ju&s;tly made him a mortal dying creature, Rom 5.12. <HI>By one man &s;in entred into the world, &amp; death by &s;in, &amp; &s;o death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, for that all have &s;inn'd.</HI> The wick|ed mu&s;t die, becau&s;e they are under the cur&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="003534_0010_0FF859F569FADB50">
of the Law, of which death is a con&s;iderable part: and though Chri&s;t hath delivered the Righteous from it, having born the cur&s;e for them, yet for great and weighty rea&s;ons they mu&s;t die al&s;o.</P>
<P>Should men upon their Conver&s;ion be pre|&s;ently made immortal, &s;everal great inconve|niences (as might ea&s;ily be &s;hew'd) would follow upon it, &amp; therefore God hath wi&s;ely order'd it otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>And then the death of the Righteous is an occa&s;ion of &s;ome great and excellent things, which would never have been without it, things that are much to the glory of God, &amp; honour of our Redeemer. I &s;hall very briefly mention &s;ome of them, Namely, a humble Sub|mi&s;&s;ion &amp; Re&s;ignation to the Will of God, in the mo&s;t trying ca&s;e, in their willingne&s;s to die, and &s;o to leave all that's dear to them in the world &amp; to part with life it &s;elf becau&s;e God will have it to be &s;o, Numb. 33 38. <HI>And Aaron the prie&s;t went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the Lord &amp; died there, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And hence Patience hath its perfect work, in the dying Saint's bearing the pains of his Sickne&s;s, yea &s;ometimes of a long &amp; &s;ore &s;ick|ne&s;s, and the very pangs and bitter agonies off death it &s;elf, as the hand of a Sovereign God upon him, with a humble, holy &s;ilence &amp; quiet|ne&s;s of &s;pirit, without any di&s;content or mur|muring
<PB N="8" REF="003534_0011_0FF859F71D70ED20">
And hence Faith al&s;o is exercis'd in &s;ome of the mo&s;t noble acts of it, in leaving Children, &amp; others very dear, with God, and in the departing &s;ouls venturing it felt for E|ternity, in the hands, &amp; under the care of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, &amp; in tru&s;ting in him, for a glorious Re&s;urrection of its now dying body, from the Dead to Life again.</P>
<P>The dying of the righteous is al&s;o an occa|&s;ion of one of the highe&s;t &amp; mo&s;t glorious acts of divine Love, in that they e&s;teem the vi&s;ion &amp; fruition of God, &amp; their being with Chri&s;t in heaven in a &s;tare of perfect holine&s;s, to be things worth dying for, &amp; therefore are wil|ling for the &s;ake of the&s;e things to leave all earthly things &amp; that for ever, and that their bodies that have been &s;o dear to them, &s;hou'd during God's plea&s;ure dwell in a &s;tate of dark|ne&s;s &amp; &s;ilence, &amp; be the &s;ubjects of loath&s;om corruption in the noi&s;on purifying Grave.</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o will ari&s;e great honour &amp; glory to the Son of God, in rai&s;ing not only the wicked, but the righteous too, and &s;o all the dead of all ages and generations to life again. The Re&s;urrectin of the Dead is a work in|expre&s;&s;ibly great &amp; wonderful, &amp; this work will be done by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Joh 5 25,&mdash;28,29 <HI>The hour cameth when the dead &s;hall hear the voice of the Son of God... The hour is coming in the which all that are in their graves &s;hall hear his voice, &amp; &s;hall come forth. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003534_0012_0FF859F8C33194C8">And herein the mighty Power, &amp; infinite Under&s;tanding of Chri&s;t will gloriou&s;ly &s;hine forth, and he will appear to be a per&s;on truly Divine. Con&s;idering the&s;e things, the Righ|teous as well as the Wicked, and &s;o all per|&s;ons living mu&s;t die.</P>
<P N="2">II <HI>God hath made it the duty of men to &s;pend their appointed time in the world, in his Service &amp; to his Glory,</HI> And indeed it is mo&s;t ju&s;t and rea&s;onable that it &s;hould be &s;o; for God is a Being of infinite Dignity &amp; Excellency, and all men have received their life &amp; being from Him, and he &s;u&s;tains them day and night and keeps them every moment: He is the Foun|tain of all that good that they enjoy or hope for. Upon God men have an ab&s;olute and intire dependance for all that they have, and for all that they need, &amp; that both for time &amp; eternity; and to Him they are under the highe&s;t Obligations: And therefore by the very law of their Creation, &amp; by all the laws &amp; rules of Rea&s;on &amp; equity, of Gratitude Pie|ty, Prudence &amp; Self-intere&s;t, they are bound to &s;erve and glorify God. And indeed that men &s;hou'd &s;pend their whole time, &amp; improve all their opportunities &amp; talents for that God who is a Being of all po&s;&s;ible Perfection, who&s;e Creatures they are, and who&s;e Service and Glory is the very end of their being, &amp; of all that they are &amp; have, is a duty &s;o rea&s;onable,
<PB N="10" REF="003534_0013_0FF859FBA8D84898">
that there can be no ju&s;t Objection again&s;t it, nor any good Excu&s;e made for the neglect of it. Deut. 10.12. <HI>And now, I&s;rael, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, &amp; to walk in his ways, &amp; to love him, &amp; to &s;erve the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul?</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. GOD <HI>hath appointed a Time wherein he will call men to an Account how they have acted in their Places, and how they have &s;pent their time in the world.</HI> Divines tell us that immediately after death, God pa&s;&s;es a parti|cular Judgment upon men; and the Scripture &s;eems plainly to favour this, &amp; to guide us to &s;uch a conclu&s;ion, Eccl. 12.7. <HI>Then &s;hall the du&s;t return to the earth, as it was, &amp; the &s;pirit to God who gave it.</HI> Not to God to enjoy Him as their Portion; this can't be the meaning of it, for it &s;peaks of all departed Souls and wicked fouls in their &s;eparate &s;tate will be far from that: therefore it mu&s;t mean that when men die, their &s;pirits or &s;ouls &s;hall return to God as their Judge, to be &s;etled by his Judicial Sen|tence in their Eternal State. The word of God al&s;o informs us, that the &s;ouls of &s;ome pre&s;ently after their death are fixed by God in a happy &s;tate, and the &s;ouls of others in a &s;tate of two &amp; mi&s;ery, Luk. 16.22, 23. <HI>And the beggar died &amp; was carried by angels into Abra|hams bo&s;om: the rich man al&s;o died &amp; was buri|ed, &amp; in hell he lift up his eyes being in torment, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="003534_0014_0FF859FEE32CCA90">It is al&s;o clear from God's word, that this pre&s;ent life is mens only time to prepare for Judgment in. When that is at an end their day of grace is pa&s;t &amp; over for ever, and they are immediately &s;et by God under a di&s;pen|&s;ation of Judgment, 2 Cor. 6.2 <HI>Behold, now is the accepted time, behold, now is the day of &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P>God hath al&s;o appointed a day or time of general Judgment, wherein all the inhabitants of the world, of all Nations &amp; Ages mu&s;t ap|pear before Him, and receive Judgment from Him. This may well be call'd (as it &s;ome|times is) the great Day of Judgment, wherein God who is infinitely the highe&s;t Maje&s;ty, the mo&s;t awful &amp; tremendous of all Beings, will appear in amazing Glory, as King &amp; Judge of the world (God in his Second Per&s;on, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I mean, who is God the Son) when the Monarchs of the world, with the Meane&s;t of the People, &s;uch as are now Judges in their Robes, with them that are Pri&s;oners in their Chains; they that &s;peak in the Name of the Lord, with them that hear them; yea, all mankind from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, from the throne to the foot&s;tool, mu&s;t &s;tand at Chri&s;t's Bar, on whom He will with the mo&s;t &s;olemn form, and in the mo&s;t open and publick manner, pa&s;s that final and definitive Sentence, that will unalterably &s;ettle them in their Everla&s;ting State, according to what
<PB N="12" REF="003534_0015_0FF85A0088B88F28">
they have done in their &s;tate of Mortality here in the world. Rev. 20 11,&mdash;<HI>And I &s;aw great white throne, and him that &s;at upon it.... And I &s;aw the dead &s;mall and great &s;tand before God &amp; the books were opened, and the dead were judged out of tho&s;e things that were written in the books, every man according to their works</HI> This is al&s;o very clear from what we have in <HI>Mathew</HI> 25.31 <HI>to the end.</HI></P>
<P>All mankind &s;hall be Judged by Chri&s;t in this &s;olemn &amp; mo&s;t open manner, that &s;o all his faithful Servants may appear with him in glory, &amp; be by Him ab&s;olved, acquitted, owned and highly honoured, and by his Sen|tence have a mo&s;t glorious Reward a&s;&s;ign'd them before all the world. And that all the wicked being condeamed by Chri&s;t to their de&s;erved Puni&s;hment, may &s;tand a&s;hamed, a|mazed &amp; confounded, before GOD, Angels and Men.</P>
<P>It is a very &s;uitable thing, &amp; mo&s;t wi&s;ely or|dered by God, that there &s;hould be a day of Judgment held in this mo&s;t publick, open &amp; s;olemn manner, that &s;oan innumerable com|pany of Angels with many millions of Man|kind, may be witne&s;&s;es to the tran&s;actions of that day &amp; of Chri&s;t's management of the grand affairs of it, that &s;o the grace, truth, ju&s;tice &amp; holine&s;s of God may gloriou&s;ly ap|pear in the view of all, and that the glorious
<PB N="13" REF="003534_0016_0FF85A023B33BF18">
Dignity and Maje&s;ty of Chri&s;t may be fully manife&s;ted in this His mo&s;t Exalted State, and that his Divine and Godlike Excellencies may in the &s;ight of all the World &s;hine forth in the Brightne&s;s and Glory of them.</P>

<P>USE, I.

<P N="6">6. <HI>Prudence.</HI> The work of a Ruler, e&s;peci|ally one of Superior Rank, is a great work, and in many ca&s;es is attended with great dif|ficulty, &amp; requires an uncommon mea&s;ure of Wi&s;dom to a right management of the con|cerns on it.

above our Brethren: And while we are under the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;miles of the Divine Benig|nity, we have a price in our hands, which if it were well Improved, might greatly tend to make us a happy People. And it mu&s;t be ac|knowledged, that you that now &s;it at the Helm of our civil State, may, with the help &amp; ble&s;&s;ing of God, contribute much to our Feli|city And truly <HI>Sirs,</HI> It's much to be de&s;ir'd, that from holy Zeal for God, and from a Pa|ternal tender Affection to this People now under your care, you would &s;et your &s;elves in good earne&s;t, to do all that you well can for their welfare, &amp; therefore for the Refor|mation of the God-provoking evils, that are to be found among us.</P>
<P>And there are two things that I &s;hall now mention, which if they were duly put in ex|erci&s;e, might prove a great &amp; happy means of our Reformation; and they are <HI>Con&s;ideration &amp; Re&s;olution.</HI> Let this Honourable A&s;&s;embly be Intreated thoro'ly to make tryal of them both.</P>

as <HI>Drunkenne&s;s, Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and other <HI>Im|moralities, vicious &amp; prophane Practices</HI>; and among others, that of Prophanation of the <HI>Sabbath</HI>; concerning which I &s;hall now briefly Ob&s;erve &s;omething, and that only in one branch of it, and that is per&s;ons com|monly &amp; without any ju&s;t cau&s;e Ab&s;enting them&s;elves from the Publick Wor&s;hip of God on the Sabbath-Day (I &s;peak not of Quakers &amp; other Sectaries, but of them that make the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion that we generally do) I can't but fear that many in this Govern|ment are very guilty of this great Neglect &amp; &s;inful Omi&s;&s;ion of their Duty. And it may truly be &s;aid of them that are thus guilty, that they live much in the Violation of the Fourth Commandment, which is, <HI>Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy</HI>; and in the Neg|lect of a principal means of putting vi&s;ible Honour upon God, and of doing their part to maintain &amp; keep up Religion in the Places where they dwell, and are guilty of putting an open &s;light upon Chri&s;t, the Offers and Tenders of the Go&s;pel, and all the glorious things contained in it, and of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> much in the neglect of the great &amp; principal means of their own Salvation. All the&s;e Evils they do at once, and live in them, that commonly neglect the Publick Wor&s;hip of God. Surely this practi&s;e in which &s;o many great Evils are contained, can be no little Sin.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="003534_0036_0FF85A316B349BA0">It may well be tho't that every Member of this A&s;&s;embly will readily own, that all ought to be done that can be done, in the great duty of turning from Sin to God: Now therefore let it be &s;eriou&s;ly Con&s;idered, whi|ther that has been done for the Reformation of this Evil?</P>
<P>Again, Con&s;ider whether there be not &s;ome way of Sin, not only yet unpurged, but al&s;o too little di&s;cover'd, &amp; le&s;s con&s;ider'd. It would be a &s;ad thing indeed, if Iniquity (&s;o hateful to God) &s;hould in any one Branch of it have a free cour&s;e among us. If there &s;hould be any thing common with us, where|by men are injured, and God is offended &amp; di&s;honour'd, and yet we &s;hould be under &s;uch a cloud of darkne&s;s, and &s;ome way or other &s;uch an evil influence, that little Te&s;timony is bor'n again&s;t it, even by them that are e&s;teem'd &s;ome of our be&s;t men. Surely this would call for lamentation &amp; mourning. Yet its po&s;&s;ible that it may be thus even among a Pro&s;e&s;&s;ing People, as the Word of God, and Experience it&s;elf do too fully prove.</P>
<P>Therefore, <HI>Sirs,</HI> pray Con&s;ider whether there be no In&s;tance of this nature to befound in this Government: and let me De&s;ire and Exhort every one to be Serious in thinking of it. Con&s;ider how it hath been of late Years, and how it is now, with a hearty willingne&s;s,
<PB N="34" REF="003534_0037_0FF85A33A3EC6940">
and with an unfeigned earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee wherein we have &s;inned, according to Job 6.24 <HI>Cau&s;e me to under&s;tand wherein I have erred.</HI> And Chap. 34.32 <HI>that which I &s;ee not, teach thou me; if I have done iniquity I will do no more.</HI></P>
<P>Search for Iniquity as with Candles, as a man &s;earches for &s;omething which he earne&s;t|ly de&s;ires to find, which otherwi&s;e may prove hurtful, if not fatal to him. Let Sin be thus enquir'd after, and &s;earched out.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall offer two things to your Con&s;ideration, which tho' they can't be &s;aid to be things in all re&s;pects of a &s;ecret and hidden nature, yet are things that have not been mention'd, that I remember on &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions, and it may be not &s;o much tho't of, as many other things that are ami&s;s among us.</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>The exce&s;&s;ive number of Law-&s;uits that are Commenced in this County.</HI> Con&s;idering what Information I have bad of it, I cannot doubt but that in this thing, there hath been, and &s;till is a great Exce&s;s. I am very apt to think (if I have been righly inform'd) there are more Law-&s;uits &s;ometimes (if not com|monly) commenc'd at one of our Inferiour Courts, than there was informer Years (yea long &s;ince my remembrance) in all the Courts of the Government for a whole Year. As there &s;eems to be a very exorbitant Exce&s;s in this thing, &s;o the inconveniences &amp; ill-effects
<PB N="35" REF="003534_0038_0FF85A3692472748">
of it we may well conclude are very great; for it mu&s;t needs con&s;ume much of our Wealth and Sub&s;tance, and that every Year. Its ea&s;y to &s;ee that it leads to Idlene&s;s, neg|lect of Bu&s;ine&s;s, vain Company-keeping, ex|ce&s;&s;ive Drinking, the con&s;umption, wa&s;te and lo&s;s of much precious Time, to the great hurt of many particular Per&s;ons and Families, in bringing them to Poverty &amp; Want, which is a great &amp; &s;ore Affliction, in which are in|folded and wrap'd up many Sorrows.</P>
<P>This thing may well be accounted to be one of our Calamities. It is an evidence of much Iniquity, &amp; an occa&s;ion of a great deal more; and how much &s;in &amp; &s;orrow may be the evil &amp; bitter fruit of it, and that from Year to Year? God only knows. I therefore would now offer it to the &s;erious Con&s;idera|tion of this Honourable A&s;&s;embly, whether &s;omething may not be done to Re&s;train this Exce&s;s, and bring &amp; keep this thing within &s;ome narrower Bounds?</P>
<P N="2">(2) Another thing that I would de&s;ire the A&s;&s;embly's &s;erious Tho't of, is, viz. <HI>Whether &s;ince the great di&s;-count of our Bills of Credit, and from thence the great advance of the Price, both of the Conveniences &amp; Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, &amp; &s;o of the Charge of Hou&s;e-keeping, great Wrong hath not been done to &s;ome Per&s;ons from Year to Year, in the Payment of what hath been due to them, &amp; that by reckoning what hath been Paid to them,
<PB N="36" REF="003534_0039_0FF85A38269EEAC8">
not according to the Value of it in former Years, but very much by the pre&s;ent Name &amp; Sound of it.</HI> My meaning is, That tho' the &s;ame Sum will not now go near half &s;o far in defraying or an&s;wering the Charge of the Expences of a Family, as it would in Years pa&s;t, yet to &s;ome Per&s;ons there is no ju&s;t Allowance made on that account. This hath been much talk'd of, &amp; condemn'd in the Country &amp; that by wi&s;e &amp; good men, both by &s;uch as have &s;uf|fer'd by it, &amp; by them al&s;o that have not. It hath been Te&s;tified again&s;t in Print, by Gen|tlemen of Note, both of Civil &amp; Sacred Or|der, as that which is very unfair and unju&s;t. Now I intreat the General A&s;&s;embly to Con|&s;ider, whether or no it hath not been thus, not only in other parts of <HI>New-England,</HI> but al&s;o in this Government, and if &s;o, whether this be according to that Divine Precept? Deut. 16.20. <HI>That which is altogether ju&s;t &s;halt thou follow.</HI> Yea, whether there be not Ini|quity in it, &amp; that which is Evil in the &s;ight of the Lord, and whether this Evil, this Ini|quity hath not had too free a cour&s;e, &amp; pa&s;&s;ed too current among us? And whether it be not Iniquity attended with &s;ome great Ag|gravations? And if upon a &s;erious &amp; impar|tial Enquiry, is be found that not only &s;uch a Practi&s;e as I have now mention'd, hath been common, among us, but that al&s;o it is not

right in the &s;ight of God, I de&s;ire it may be &s;eriou&s;ly Con&s;ider'd by them, yea all of 'em whom it principally concerns, whether they ought not to do all that they can in Obedi|ence to God, &amp; in Faithfulne&s;s to their Tru&s;t, that it may be Reform'd?</P>
<P>There is certainly a &s;pirit in every truly godly man, from a gracious re&s;pect to God, univer&s;ally to love truth &amp; righteou&s;ne&s;s; &amp; to hate, abhor &amp; bear Te&s;timony again&s;t all Iniquity: and this is unque&s;tionably the duty of every Chri&s;tian, &amp; e&s;pecially of <HI>Chri&s;tian Magi&s;trates</HI> and <HI>the Mini&s;ters of God's Word</HI>; yea of all that act in a <HI>Publick Capacity</HI> among us. Let all &s;uch therefore &s;eriou&s;ly think of their Duty, and take heed that they don't in any ca&s;e contract guilt before God by the neglect of it.

<P N="2">[2] The &s;econd means of it is <HI>Re&s;olution.</HI> A &s;incere, godly &amp; firm Re&s;olution in <HI>Rulers</HI> is very needful for, and a great help to the thorough Reformation of a People.

have been fal&s;e Profe&s;&s;ors, and among the fooli&s;h Virgins; If when God in his Provi|dence &s;hall &s;ay to us, behold thy days are Numbred and Fini&s;hed, any of us be them found to have been unfaithful in our Places, &amp; if after all our Profe&s;&s;ion, E&s;teem &amp; Name on Earth, with our hopes of Heaven, we &s;hould meet with that from our Judge in the other World in Rev 3.2. <HI>I have not found thy Works Perfect before God.</HI> Or that in Dan 5.27. <HI>Thou art weighed in the Ballance, &amp; art found Wanting.</HI> O how dreadful would it be! How amazing! How Confounding! How may the tho'ts of &s;uch a thing, put us in mind of the words of the Prophet, Hab 3.16. <HI>When I heard my Belly trembled; my Lips quivered at the voice, I trem|bled in my &s;elf.</HI> And as for you that are now &s;e|cure in your &s;ins, &amp; carele&s;s of your Souls, that pa&s;s your time plea&s;antly &amp; merrily away, walking after the fight of your eyes, and the lu&s;ts of your hearts; that live in the Neglect &amp; Contempt of Chri&s;t, &amp; his great Salvation, and in daily Di&s;obedience to God and the Go&s;pel, what will you do in the end thereof? What will you do in the day of Vi&s;itation? When God ri&s;eth up, what will you an&s;wer him? To whom will you flee for help? What will you that are now Chri&s;t-de&s;pi&s;ers &amp; re|jecters, do when you are dying, &amp; ju&s;t &s;lepping into Eternity? When the Judge of the World
<PB N="61" REF="003534_0064_0FF85A72EE9A0DC0">
comes to Call you to an Account, how will you do to &s;tand before him? How will you an&s;wer that awful Voice, that &s;olemn Call of the Arch-angel with the Trump of God, and in the Name of the great Judge in the&s;e Words, or &s;omething equivalent to them, Ari&s;e ve Dead and Come to Judgment</P>
<P>And what will you do when Judgment is pa&s;s'd upon you, if that &s;hould be your Doom (which God in mercy to your Souls forbid) Matth 2.5.41. <HI>Depart from me, ye Cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI> And if that &s;hould be your ca&s;e, Mat 25.46. <HI>And the&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment.</HI> Sirs, Seriou&s;ly Con&s;ider the&s;e things, and &s;ay in your hearts, O how can I bear the Torments of eternal Fire! How can I dwell with everla&s;ting Burnings! O my Soul while thou ha&s;t yet time in the world, improve it, and if po&s;&s;ible get into a &s;tate of Grace &amp; Salvation that thou may'&s;t be ready for thy departure hence &amp; for eternal Judg|ment, that thou may'&s;t not be Condemned, Lo&s;t &amp; Damn'd forever in the other World.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>And La&s;tly,</HI> Let us Con&s;ider the great Uncertainty of our Time in this world. Whatever we have to do in our Publick or Private Capacities, for Body or Soul for Time or Eternity, mu&s;t be done while this pre&s;ent Life la&s;ts, &amp; who knows how &s;hort that may
<PB N="62" REF="003534_0065_0FF85A74C1F772D0">
be? Who can tell what the events of Provi|dence may be in the Cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent Year? Who knows where any that are now in Au|thority, or of the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel here pre&s;ent, or any of us now within the&s;e Walls may be before another Day of Election?</P>
<P>Let us all Con&s;ider in how &s;hort a time the Sovereign Lord of life and Time, and holy Judge of the World, may make a great Change in our pre&s;ent Place &amp; State: How &s;oon may be take our Son's from our Bodies, &amp; lay our Bodies in the cold &amp; dark Grave, and &s;et our Souls at his mo&s;t awful Bar, &amp; by his definitive and irrever&s;ible Sentence, &s;etle us in our eternal State? How &s;hould this affect the hearts of tho&s;e of us, that are in pub|lick Place, both of Civil &amp; Sacred Order, Con|&s;idering how great our work is, &amp; what a great account we have to give up to God, &amp; that it infinitely Concerns us to be ready for it?</P>
<P>And with what &s;erious &amp; &s;olemn Tho'ts, &s;hould all unconverted Sinners think of this, that have their Peace yet to make with their Judge, &amp; who, if they die, as they have hither|to liv'd, are &s;ure to receive from him a Sen|tence of Condemnation, a mo&s;t fearful Doom of eternal Damnation with Devils in Hell.</P>
<P>And as this terrible Sentence, this di&s;mal Dam|ning Doom will &s;urely be pa&s;&s;ed by God upon all Chri&s;tle&s;s &amp; Impenitent Sinners, at the great Day: So it will mo&s;t certainly be Executed upon them in their future State (to which they are daily ha&s;t|ning)
<PB N="63" REF="003534_0066_0FF85A781FC02898">
and that without the lea&s;t Pity or Mercy, except by Faith in Chri&s;t and true Repentance they turn from their Sins to God, before Death comes, which is daily coming, and is (doubtle&s;s) very near to &s;ome of them, &amp; God only knows who they are. Let all therefore here pre&s;ent before God, who&s;e ca&s;e this is, be advi&s;ed &amp; per&s;waded without the lea&s;t longer delay in the diligent u&s;e of God's appointed means, with fear and trembling, ari&s;ing from a Sen&s;e of their pre&s;ent danger, to &s;eek the Lord &amp; wait upon him for his Mercy &amp; Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, while yet there may be hope. Before I Conclude, I &s;hall only further &s;ay,</P>
<P>We are never like to meet all together again in this World, it being very probable that our next General Meeting will be at the Bar of Chri&s;t, and before the Judgment Seat of God, in our Immortal and Eternal State. Now &s;eeing the Ca&s;e &s;tands thus with us, Let us make it our great Care &s;o to &s;pend the remaining Part of our pre&s;ent, &s;hort, uncertain Life, in the work of our General and Particular Callings I mean as we are Chri&s;tians, and with re|&s;pect to the Places wherein we &s;tand, that we may then appear in Glory at the Right Hand of Chri&s;t, and give up our account to the acceptance of our Judge, and with Joy un&s;peakable and Glorious in our own Souls. I &s;hall Clo&s;e all with two Texts of Scripture agreeable to the two &s;olemn Things which have been &s;o much the Subject matter of this whole Di&s;cour&s;e, I mean Death and Judgment <HI>viz.</HI> Eccl. 9.10 <HI>What&s;oever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might, for there is no work nor devi&s;e nor knowledge, nor wi&s;dom in the Grave, whether thou goest.</HI> Rom 14, 10, 11, 12. <HI>We &s;hall all &s;tand before the Judgment Seat of Chri&s;t. For it is written, As I Live faith the Lord every knee &s;hall bow to me, &amp;c. So then every one of us, &s;hall give an account of him&s;elf to God.</HI></P>
