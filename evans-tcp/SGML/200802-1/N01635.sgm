<P N="1">1. THE fir&s;t Divi&s;ion contains the fir&s;t Three hundred years of Chri&s;tianity, which may be accounted the mo&s;t Refi|ned and pure&s;t Time, both as to Faith and Manners, that the Chri&s;tian

Church has been Honoured with; for that within this &s;pace, is contained the Mini&s;try of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and Holy <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> and o|ther Emment per&s;ons Authorized by them; and &s;uch others who &s;ucceeded in Office-Tru&s;t through the &s;everal Ages, within the &s;pace before named. This was the time of an Immen&s;e Effu&s;ion of the Spirit of God upon the World, when there was &s;uch a Flux and Inundation of the Waters from the Sanctuary, mentioned, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 47. This was the Age of Miracles; A time of Extraordinary Gifts, and when Grace and true Piety was in the greate&s;t Elevation. Chri&s;tian Religion was now a Dangerous Bu&s;ine&s;s; Every Man that took it up, lays down his Life, Honour and Fortune at Stake; He that owns Chri&s;t mu&s;t bid defiance to all the Celebrated De+ities of the Roman Empire; and thereby Run Counter to the Religion of the Imperial Court. So that Rationally we may expect to find the Churches of Chri&s;t in the pure&s;t Ca|pacity they were ever in; In all points, both of Principles and Practice. That whatever their Government was if they continue the &s;ame from the days of the Apo&s;tles, we may fairly conclude it to be Authentick, and A|greeable with their Grand &amp; Original Copy. It is mo&s;t Apparent, that the Churches in tho&s;e Ages, were under too good an Influence Internally, and the Eye of too direful a guard, externally to prevaricate with God
<PB N="5" REF="001941_0004_0FBA202E83116680">
in the known Principles of their Order, any more then in their Faith, tho' they were not without Errors. Two or three hundred years, is a long time in the World, to keep up our con&s;tant Mode, and Cu&s;tome, either in Religious or Civil affairs among&s;t Men, who are &s;o inclined to Err, and apt to Change their fa&s;hions; <HI>Nam e&s;t Natura homi|num Novitatis Avida.</HI> That for the Chur|ches through tho&s;e many Ages and in their &s;everal Communities, to agree in their Di&s;|cipline among&s;t them&s;elves; and not E&s;&s;enti|ally to differ from tho&s;e Churches that were truly Apo&s;tolical, invincibly Infers, that their Original was Divine. But this will appear more plainly when we have made and fi|ni&s;hed our <HI>Survey.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Second Grand Divi&s;ion of Time, contains the &s;pace of the next Twelve hun|dred years, downward, more or le&s;s: within which Circuit is included the Commence|ment, and Progre&s;s of a Direful Apo&s;tacy, both as to Wor&s;hip, and Government in the Churches. Some Symptoms of the&s;e things were ri&s;ing within the former Divi&s;ion of time; but, in this they grew a great pace, and to that degree, that the Chri&s;tian World became a Notorious Apo&s;tare. For as we have it in the Idea of the Reformation, the Great Lord of time allowed a &s;pace, wear|ing the Denomination of Time, Times, and half a Time: or in plainer Expre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="6" REF="001941_0005_0FBA20322ABCA0C8">
twelve hundred and &s;ixty years; in which &s;pace, all the Effects of a horrible Apo&s;tacy made a very <HI>Gehennon</HI> of that which was called Chri&s;tendom. And &s;ays Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> [in his Preface, to the Inquiry, into the Original of the Churches] <HI>Ambros</HI> judged, that it was the Pride, or Ambition of the Doctors of the Church, which Introduced the Alteration in its Order. And moreover &s;ays the Dr. &s;omewhat after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>the Ambition of Church Rulers, in the fourth &amp; fifth Centuries openly proclaimed it &s;elf to the &s;candal of the Chri&s;tian Religi|on; for that their Intere&s;t lead them to a Deviation from the Order and Di&s;cipline of the Church according to its fir&s;t In&s;titution?</Q>
For that the Directions given about it in Scripture, make it a matter &s;o weighty in it &s;elf, and attended with &s;o many Difficul|ties, it being laid under &s;uch &s;evere Inter|dictions of Lordly power, or &s;eeking either of Wealth or Dignity; That it's no plea&s;ant thing to Fle&s;h, and Blood, to engage in the conduct, and over&s;ight of Chri&s;t's volunteers; to bear with their manners; to exerci&s;e pa|cience towards them in all their Infirmities; and in all their weakne&s;&s;es, to continue a high valuation for them, as the Flock of God, which he hath purcha&s;ed with his own Blood: All this requires abundance of &s;elf|denial; And if &s;o, then it's no wonder, that many of their Prelates were willing gradually
<PB N="7" REF="001941_0006_0FBA203583B9A0E8">
to Extricate them&s;elves out of this unea&s;y Condition; and embrace all Opportinities of Introducing another Order into the Churches, that might tend more to the Exaltation of their own power and Dignity. And this was done accordingly; for the Bi&s;hops by their Arbitrary Rules &s;hared the Flock of Chri&s;t among&s;t them&s;elves, and that without the con&s;ent of the People, as though they had Conquered them by the Sword. For thus they divide the &s;poil. This Bi&s;hop &s;ay they, &s;hall have &s;uch a &s;hare and number of them under his power; And that Other Bi&s;hop &s;hall have &s;o many; And &s;o far &s;hall the Juri&s;diction of one Extend, and &s;o far ano|ther; that they &s;oon Canton out the whole Roman Empire under a few Patriarchs, and head Men. The&s;e things were the &s;ubject of their Decrees and Laws, which [tho&s;e of Chri&s;ts being thrown by] were now be|come a Rule for the Churches. But yet nei|ther did the Bi&s;hops long keep within tho&s;e Bounds and Limits, which their more mode&s;t Ambition had at fir&s;t Pre&s;cribed unto them; but went on, and took Occa&s;ion from the&s;e beginnings to contend among&s;t them&s;elves a|bout Preheminency, Dignity, and Power: in which Conte&s;t, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI> at length remained Ma&s;ter of the Field; And &s;o <HI>Rome</HI> obtained the &s;econd Conque&s;t of the World. And then his Holine&s;s the head of it came to ride Admiral of all the <HI>Sees</HI>; and then
<PB N="8" REF="001941_0007_0FBA2036D3DC84B8">
&s;oon became Lord of Heaven and Earth by the &s;ame Rule of Proce&s;s which brought him to his high Tru&s;t. Hence</P>
<P>Quaery. What can't wakeful Ambition, Learning and Fraud do, if joyntly agreed, at rifling the greate&s;t Trea&s;ures bequeathed to Mankind; e&s;pecially when the World is generally gotten into a &s;leepy fit?</P>
<P N="3">3. Towards the latter End of this &s;pace of time began a glorious Reformation. Ma|ny famous Per&s;ons, memorable in Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Hi&s;tory, being moved by the Spirit of God, and according to Holy Writ, lead the way in the face of all danger; &s;uch has <HI>Wickliff,</HI> who openly Decryed the Pope, as the very Antichri&s;t; in the fourteenth Cen|tury, and others in that Age. And in the next Century <HI>Martin Luther</HI> pur&s;ued the Re|formation with great Boldne&s;s, Re&s;olution, and Con&s;tancy; This is that famous <HI>Luther,</HI> &s;ays my Author, of whom they who acknow|ledge the lea&s;t, mu&s;t yet make as much as Dr. <HI>More</HI> makes of him; for &s;aith the Dr.
<Q>I cannot think &s;o very highly of <HI>Luther</HI> as &s;ome do; and yet I think him to have been, a very happy In&s;trument in the hand of God, for the good of Chri&s;tendom again&s;t the horrid Enormities of the Papal Hyrarchy. And though he might not be allowed to be the <HI>Elias,</HI> the Conducter &amp; Chariot of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as &s;ome have &s;tiled him; yet I think at lea&s;t he might be accounted a faithful Po&s;tilion
<PB N="9" REF="001941_0008_0FBA20385CFD47A8">
in that Chariot, who was well accoutred with his Wax Boots, Oiled Coat, and Hood; &amp; who turned the Hor&s;es No&s;es into a di|rect way from <HI>Babylon</HI> toward the City of God, and held on in a good round Trot, through thick and thin, not caring to be&s;pat|ter others in this high fogg, as he him&s;elf was finely be&s;pattered by others:</Q>
About which Time <HI>Zuinglius, Occolampadius, Melancthan</HI> and other Chri&s;tian Heroes al&s;o Li&s;ted into the &s;ame Quarrel, and with great bravery and &s;elf denial went forward with the Re|formation. Yet after the endeavours of &s;uch Men, and others without number, through &s;everal Ages downward; the Churches, which are called Reformed, attained to a very im|perfect Reformation, as Dr. <HI>Increa&s;e Mather</HI> &s;ays. And the defect has not been &s;o much in Doctrine, as in Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline. And nowith&s;tanding &s;ays the Dr. in this Re&s;pect al&s;o, &s;ome Churches have gone be|yond others&punc; Now to come to what I aim at; The&s;e Churches in <HI>New-England,</HI> as to their Order and Di&s;cipline have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all Churches of the Reformation. And un|der the head of Di&s;cipline, it &s;eems to me, that Chri&s;t the Captain of Salvation, has given out his Word to the&s;e Churches, as to his Troops coming up in the Reer of Time; And his Word of Command is, &mdash; as you were; make good the Old front; or place your &s;elves in that Regimental Order, which
<PB N="10" REF="001941_0009_0FBA2039E6ADA068">
the Primitive Churches were in, whil&s;t they march't under my Banners, &amp; encountred the Devil in their heathen Per&s;ecuters for the fir&s;t Three hundred years. For that the Churches in <HI>New-England</HI>; and the Primitive Churches are Eminently parallel in their Government. Tho&s;e fir&s;t Ages of the Church it is certain were many times much annoyed with many Pe&s;tilent and Damnable Here&s;ies; and many U&s;ages in Wor&s;hip, too Super&s;titious crept in among&s;t them; yet they continued in the Con&s;titution of their Church Order very Uniform and Apo&s;tolical; And it is very Obvious that the&s;e Churches in this Wilder|ne&s;s, in the E&s;&s;entials of Government; are every way Parallel to them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall Repre&s;ent this Bu&s;ine&s;s by a Col|lection of Parallel Notes out of &s;everal Au|thors of unque&s;tionable veracity; and &s;hall principally follow the Guidance of one who has concealed his Name; and &s;tiles his Trea|ti&s;e,
<Q>An Inquiry into the Con&s;titution, Di&s;|cipline, Unity and Wor&s;hip of the Primitive Churches.</Q>
This Author in his Praeface gives this fair account of his doings; &s;ays he, <HI>What I have written I have wholly Collected out of the Genuine, and &V;nque&s;tionably Authentick Writing's of tho&s;e Ages</HI>; meaning &s;uch as writ in, or of the Three fir&s;t Centuries of Chri&s;ti|anity. And &s;ays he, <HI>I have been every may Honest and &V;nbiast.</HI> And being well a&s;&s;ured of his Fidelity; I &s;hall endeavour to imitate his
<PB N="11" REF="001941_0010_0FBA203CC23DAB60">
Faithfulne&s;s, in Tran&s;cribing what I find in him &s;uiting my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. And I &s;hall be well and &s;ufficiently furni&s;hed when I have laid before the Reader the notion which the Ancients had of the Church in its Con|&s;tituent parts both of Officers and People, with the &s;everal Authorities, Powers, Rights, Immunities and Prerogatives belonging unto each. And if we find that the Primitive Churches in their Order and Di&s;cipline, did exactly agree in the E&s;&s;entials of Government; with the Churches in <HI>New-England</HI>; we may Rationally then conclude that if they were Apo&s;tolical, &s;o are we.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Church.</HEAD>
<P>TO Pa&s;s over all other Ob&s;ervations, the mo&s;t u&s;ual and common Acceptation of the word <HI>Church,</HI> of which we mu&s;t chiefly Treat, is that of a Particular Church; which con&s;i&s;ts of a So|ciety of Chri&s;tians, meeting together in one Place, under their proper Pa&s;tors, for the per|formance of Religious Wor&s;hip, and the Exer|ci&s;ing of Chri&s;tian Di&s;cipline. This de&s;cription of a Church is agreeable with the <HI>Idiom</HI> both of Scripture and Antiquity. Thus <HI>Tertullian,</HI> who Lived about the End of the Second Century, gives us an account of the State, Order &amp; Wor|&s;hip of the Churches. (<HI>Apol. ad Gen. Cap.</HI> 39.) The De&s;cription of a Church he fir&s;t lays down in the&s;e words, <HI>viz. Corpus &s;umus de Con&s;cientia
<PB N="12" REF="001941_0011_0FBA20409A1E37E0">
Religionis, et Di&s;ciplinae &V;nitate, et Spei Foedere.</HI> We are a Body united in the Con&s;cience of Reli|gion, or for the Con&s;ciencious Ob&s;ervation of the Duties of Religion; by an Agreement in Di&s;cipline, and in a Covenant of Hope. For whereas &s;uch a Body, or Religious Society could not be United but by a Covenant; he calls it a Covenant of Hope, becau&s;e the principal re&s;pect therein was had unto the things hoped for. This Religious Body, or Society thus United by Co|venant, did meet together in the &s;ame A&s;&s;embly, or Congregation. For &s;ays he, <HI>Corpus &s;umus, Co|imus in Coetum, et Congregationem ut ad Deum, &amp;c.</HI> We are a Body, and meet in an A&s;&s;embly, and Congregation, to offer up our Prayers unto God, and attend the Duties of the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion. So <HI>Iraeneus</HI> al&s;o in the Second Century, tells us, <HI>That &s;ome of the Brethren, and &s;ometimes the whole Church of &s;ome certain Place,&mdash;by Fa&s;t|ing and Prayer have Rai&s;ed the Dead.</HI> Thus our own Platform agrees in &s;en&s;e with the Opinion of the Ancients. <HI>Plat. Chap.</HI> 2. <HI>Sect.</HI> 6. <HI>A Con|gregational Church, is by the In&s;titution of Chri&s;t, a part of the Militant Church, Con&s;i&s;ting of a Compa|ny of Saints by Calling, &V;nited into one Body by an holy Covenant,</HI> &amp;c. But as to the Independency, or real di&s;tinction between Church and Church; this will more clearly appear in what follows. Therefore I &s;hall proceed to con&s;ider the Con|&s;tituent Parts of a Church, as divided,</P>
<P N="1">1. Into the People who Compo&s;ed the Body of the Church, called the Elect, or the Called and Sanctified by the Will of God; and &s;ome|times they are called the Brethren, becau&s;e of their Brotherly Love, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Into tho&s;e Per&s;ons who were &s;et apart for

Office, or for a Peculiar and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Im|provement. And each Party under this di&s;tri|bution, had their particular Immunities and Im|ployments And under the&s;e Heads, I &s;hall con|fine the Di&s;cour&s;e to a parallel in the E&s;&s;entials in Government or Church Order, between the Churches of Chri&s;t in the Fir&s;t Ages of Chri&s;ti|nity, and the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> as &s;et|tled by their Platform</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>I Shall Proceed to di&s;tribute &amp; Enumerate the Operations and Immunities of the Churches.</P>
<P N="1">1. With relation to the Peculiar Acts of the Officers.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Peculiar Acts of the Laity, or Frater|nity.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Joynt Acts of them both; as perform|ing the Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s of an Organick Church, or compleat Corporation. And</P>
<P N="4">4. I &s;hall La&s;tly, make &s;ome Ob&s;ervations up|on the Union of Di&s;tinct Churches, by Acts of Si&s;terly Fellow&s;hip or Communion. And here|by I &s;hall compleat the Parallel, in the E&s;&s;entials of Order, between the Primitive Churches, and tho&s;e of this Country.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Peculiar Acts of the Officers or Cler|gy. Under this Head might be con&s;idered the Functions of every Particular Order, and De|gree of the Clergy; which we may &s;ay were according to the pure&s;t Antiquity, but three, <HI>viz.</HI> Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts or Presbyters, and Dea|cons. I &s;hall principally con&s;ider the Bi&s;hop as the Chief Officer in Tru&s;t and Dignity, in the Primitive Church. And in order to it,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="14" REF="001941_0013_0FBA2044443F6318">1. In general Ob&s;erve, That tho' there were &s;ome Di&s;tinctions in point of a Titular Dignity and Degree, between a Bi&s;hop and Presbyter; yet they were really equal in Order, and in the Nature of their Tru&s;t. For that in an Eccle&s;ia&s;|tical Sen&s;e, Bi&s;hop and Presbyters are Synoni|mous Terms, &s;etting forth the &s;ame Office; and &s;ignifie no more but an Elder, a Pa&s;tor, Ru|ler, or Over&s;eer of a Church. <HI>Ignatius</HI> calls the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves the Presbyters of the Church; and <HI>Theodonet</HI> renders the rea&s;on of the Appellation, for &s;aith he,
<Q>The Holy Scrip|tures called the Chief Men of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the Senate or Elder&s;hip <BIBL><HI>Wil&s;. Dict.</HI></BIBL></Q>
And indeed according to the Apo&s;tle him&s;elf, Presbyters, or Elders, and Bi&s;hops, are plainly Terms of Office; and of equal &s;ignification. As in <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.5, 7. <HI>For this cau&s;e left I thee in</HI> Crete, <HI>that thou &s;houlde&s;t &mdash;Ordain Elders.&mdash;For a Bi&s;hop mu&s;t be Blame|le&s;s, as the Steward of God,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In this Di&s;cour&s;e I &s;hall repre&s;ent the Bi&s;hop in the &s;en&s;e of the Primitive Churches, as Head and Chief Officer of the Church; for according to <HI>Cyprian,</HI> there was but one Bi&s;hop, &s;trictly &s;o called, in a Church at a time, tho' at the &s;ame time there were many Elders or Presbyters in the &s;ame Church; and the Bi&s;hop in a peculiar manner was Related to his Flock, as a Pa&s;tor to his Sheep and a Parent to his Children. <HI>Cyp. E|pi&s;t.</HI> 38. &sect; 1. <HI>p.</HI> 90. And the Titles of this Su|pream Church Officer, are mo&s;t of them reckon|ed up in one place, in <HI>Cup. Epi&s;t.</HI> 96 <HI>viz.</HI> Bi&s;hop, Pa&s;tor, Pre&s;ident, Governour, Superintendant or Prie&s;t. And this Officer is he, which in the <HI>Revelation,</HI> is called, <HI>The Angel of the Church,</HI> at <HI>Origen</HI> thinks.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="001941_0014_0FBA2045C2623AC0">2. We may con&s;ider more di&s;tinctly, the Ob|ject of his Care, or the Dimen&s;ions of the Bi|&s;hops Dioce&s;s. It's very obvious, that this Great and Superiour Officer, as has been &s;aid; had but one Church under his Pa&s;toral Care. The Dioce&s;&s;es Government or Dominion of the&s;e Reverend Prelates, are never [according to An|tiquity] &s;aid to contain Churches, in the Plu|ral, but only a Church, in the Singular Num|ber. And the Bi&s;hop was u&s;ually called the Bi|&s;hop of this or that Church. As <HI>Tertullian</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Polycarp</HI> was Ordained Bi&s;hop of the Church of <HI>Smyrna, &amp;c.</HI> And moreover it is accurately to be ob&s;erved, that the mo&s;t frequent word u&s;ed to Denominate the Extent of the Bi&s;hops Care, or to &s;et out the Limits of his Dioce&s;s, was that of a Pari&s;h. So in the Synodical Epi&s;tle of <HI>Ire|naeus</HI> to <HI>Victor.</HI> The Bi&s;hopricks of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> are called Pari&s;hes: And in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Ex&s;ebius</HI> the word is &s;o applied in &s;everal hundred places. It's very u&s;ual there to Read of Bi&s;hops of this and that Pari&s;h. As the Bi&s;hop of the Pari&s;h in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> the Bi&s;hop of the Pari&s;h in <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> and in <HI>Corinth,</HI> &amp;c. For that the word <HI>Paroikia,</HI> which we render <HI>Pari&s;h,</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>Hou&s;ing,</HI> or <HI>Li|ving</HI> together. And in Ordinary and Civil U&s;e, it notes a Village, &s;mall Town, or part of a Town, of People or Per&s;ons Dwelling together. And in a Church &s;en&s;e it &s;ignifies a competent Number of Chri&s;tians Dwelling near together, and having one Bi&s;hop, Pa&s;tor or Mini&s;ter, or more, &s;et over them; with whom they meet at one Time or Place, to Wor&s;hip and Serve God. So that Pari&s;h in this &s;en&s;e, is the &s;ame with a Particular-Church or Congregation. And this is plainly agreeable with the Sen&s;e, Cu&s;tome &amp; Platform of <HI>New-England</HI> Churches.</P>

<P><HI>D&egrave;mon&s;t.</HI> 1. For that all the People of a Dio|ce&s;s did every <HI>Sunday,</HI> meet together in one Place, to Celebrate Divine Service.

<P><HI>Demon&s;t.</HI> 2. The Bi&s;hop had but one Altar, or Communion-Table in his Dioce&s;s, at which his whole Flock Received the Sacrament from him. There is but one Altar &s;ays <HI>Ignatius</HI> [<HI>Epi&s;t ad Phila. p.</HI> 41.] as there is but one Bi&s;hop. So &s;ays <HI>Cyprian,</HI> we Celebrate the Sacrament; the whole Brotherhood being pre&s;ent. And thus it was in <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyrs</HI> Days.

<P><HI>Demon&s;t.</HI> 5 When the Bi&s;hop of a Church was Dead, all the People of that Church met together in one Place to Chu&s;e a new Bi&s;hop. So <HI>Sacinus</HI> was Cho&s;en Bi&s;hop of <HI>Emetria,</HI> by
<PB N="17" REF="001941_0016_0FBA204D5D2332B0">
the Suffrage of all the Brotherhood. The whole Dioce&s;s of the Bi&s;hops did meet toge|ther to manage Church Affairs. Thus when the Schi&s;m of <HI>Felici&s;&s;imus,</HI> in the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Carthage</HI> was to be Debated, it was to be done according to the Will of the People, &amp; by the Con&s;ent of the Laity.

So that from the Premi&s;es, it is very evident, that that Dioce&s;s cannot po&s;&s;ibly be more than one &s;ingle Congregation; nor that Church more than a Congregational Church, where all the People and Members of that Church meet together at one time, and in one place to Pray together, to Receive the Sacrament together; A&s;&s;i&s;t at Church-Cen&s;ures together, and Di&s;patch Church-Affairs together. And it is very apparent, that this was the Method and Way of the Primitive Churches, accord|ing to the Preceeding Ob&s;ervations. And <HI>New-England</HI> Churches harmonize exactly in their common Practice, as tho' they had taken their Directions from them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. The Prerogatives, or Peculiar Immunities of the Laity.</HEAD>
<P>THE Fraternity or Body of the People had &s;everal high Immunities Inherent in them; and Exerci&s;ed by them as a Church. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. Voting and giving their Suffrage, for the Admi&s;&s;ion and Cen&s;ure of Members. To this purpo&s;e before.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Electing their own Officers. For when a Pari&s;h, or Bi&s;hoprick was vacant through the Death of the Incumbent, the Members of that Pari&s;h met in Church to choo&s;e a fit per&s;on for his Succe&s;&s;or; to whom they might commit the Care and Govern|ment of the Church.

&s;ome time the a&s;piring Clergy rob'd the Peo|ple of this as well as of other of their Rights. As it is well Repre&s;ented by a late very wor|thy Anomolous Author, writing <HI>de Ordinatione</HI> P. 30. <HI>Cre&s;cente Paulatim Cleri Potestate ad &s;e magis indies,</HI> &amp;c. The Power of the Clergy gra|dually increa&s;ing, they daily drew more new Rights to them&s;elves, which they took from the People; Thinking that the dignity which they had obtained, was not ample enough, if the People had any &s;hare with them in Elections. Therefore at length &s;natch or take the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s into their own hands; The People through their &s;upine negligence not much oppo&s;ing of them. Yet that the People might be hu&s;ht into quiet [with much Grace] they grant them the favour of Beggars, <HI>viz. Po&s;tulare</HI>; To ask for an Officer. But this plundering of the Churches falls within the Second Grand Divi&s;ion of Time. Not within the fir&s;t three hundred years.</P>
<P N="3">3. Of Approbating of Ordination. All the People were con&s;ulted; and none were Admitted into holy Orders without their Approbation. As we are a&s;&s;ured by <HI>Cyprian</HI> [<HI>Epist.</HI> 33.] who tells us it was his con|&s;tant cu&s;tom, in all Ordinations to con&s;ult his People, and with their conmmon Coun&s;el to weigh the Merit of every Candidate of the Sacred Orders.</P>

Al&s;o when two <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Bi|&s;hops were depo&s;ed by their Churches, that the &s;aid Churches might not &s;eem to act by a Power which belonged not to them; they &s;ent into <HI>Africa</HI> to &s;everal Bi&s;hops to know their Judgment thereupon, who being Con|vened in a Synod [<HI>Anno.</HI> 258.] whereof <HI>Cyprian</HI> was Pre&s;ident; they commended, and approved their Procedings; a&s;&s;uring them it was according to the Divine Law, which was Expre&s;s, that none but tho&s;e that were holy

The Ordinary Power of Govern|ment belongs only to the Elders; and Power of Priviledge remaineth with the Brotherhood, [as the Power of Judgment in matters of Cen&s;ure, and Power of Liberty in matters of Liberty] thence it follows, that in an Or|ganick Church, and Right Admini&s;tration, all Church acts proceed after the manner of a mixt Admini&s;tration, &s;o that no Church act can be con&s;ummated, or perfected without the con&s;ent of both.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P N="4">4. I Shall nextly con&s;ider the Fellow&s;hip and Communion that Di&s;tinct Churches had &amp; held one with another.</P>
<P>It is very obvious by this Time, [and he mu&s;t blind his own Eyes that won't &s;ee it] That the Primitive Churches [according to the Account we have of their Regiment for the fir&s;t three hundred years from Chri&s;t] were di&s;tinct Poli|tical Bodies; and neither Diocae&s;an, National, Provincial nor Cla&s;&s;ical, but properly Congre|gational Churches. And as &s;uch, were perfect and compleat Societies Incorporate; &s;o that they had a Power, and Capacity of carrying on all Church-work within them&s;elves, and wanted not to borrow, or receive from others, for the &s;upport of their Being, and &s;o were Indepen|dent. Yet con&s;idering they were imperfect in
<PB N="25" REF="001941_0024_0FBA205F62D11DD0">
their Matter, and therefore to help, forward their Well-being, wanted the advantage of all good means; with the influence of the Grace, Love, Knowledge, Experience, Wi&s;dom, and Coun&s;el of each other; &s;o they were dependent, and became mutually Officious, and accountable each to other: Somewhat after the manner, as Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hes on the Independency, and Dependency of Go&s;pel Churches. <HI>Pol. Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. Says he, <HI>Independency implies two things.</HI> Either,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>An ab&s;olute Supremacy, oppo&s;ed to Subordina|tion; and &s;o a Particular Church is not Indepen|dent, it being accountable to Civil Government,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and al&s;o to the Con&s;ociation of Churches.</HI> Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Independency &s;ignifies a &s;ufficiency in its kind, for the attainment of its End. And in this &s;en&s;e, Independency is oppo&s;ed to Imperfection: And if we take it thus, then a Particular Church may be &s;aid to be Independent, it being &s;ufficient to attain the end it was In&s;tituted for; it having compleat power, when rightly Con&s;tituted, to Exerci&s;e all the Ordinances of God. And thus we find, that the Primitive Churches in this &s;en&s;e were Independent Churches: That is, every Particular Church had a &s;ufficient Right and Power, without the Concurrence and Authority of any other Church, to carry on the Wor&s;hip of God, and Exerci&s;e of Di&s;cipline in their di&s;tinct Society. And yet as they were Parts of the &V;niver&s;al Church, held them&s;elves obliged to a &s;uitable Communion. And for the &s;upport of &V;|nity, Love, and Concord among&s;t them, and to ad|vi&s;e about their common Circum&s;tances and Conditi|on; and al&s;o to Regulate their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Af|fairs within their general Limits, for their mutual advantage; did therefore form them&s;elves into Sy|nodical
<PB N="26" REF="001941_0025_0FBA2061B49D1DC0">
A&s;&s;emblies, and were governed in common by them; for that their Synodical Decrees, Canons or In&s;titutions, were accounted Obligatory to all the Churches, who had their Repre&s;entatives in the Sy|nods. For indeed to what purpo&s;e el&s;e did they draw up their Re&s;olves, but for the good and bene|fit of the whole Community. And it would have been very fruitle&s;s to have made we ari&s;ome Jour|neys, with great co&s;t and pains to determine &s;uch things, as they judged expedient for the Churches Well-being; if after all, it were indifferent whether they were obeyed or no: Or that when the whole was agreed, &s;ome &s;hould reluct, &amp; remon&s;trate; &amp; e&s;pecially when things were fairly &s;ettled by a joynt Suffrage in Synods, &s;ome &s;mall &s;eat of Wi&s;e Men &s;hould hold them&s;elves wi&s;er than whole Synods; and afterward &s;hould of their own heads in their more private Apartments &s;et forward new Schemes, which in it &s;elf is di&s;orderly, and a way to keep the Churches con&s;tantly fluctuating, and re&s;tle&s;s, like the un&s;table Ocean. And indeed, con&s;idering the Regularity, Wi&s;dom and &V;nion in Synodical Settlements, whil&s;t that all &s;orts of per&s;ons intere&s;t|ed, both Officers and People having had their full liberty in Debates, and their free Votes and Suf|frages, in drawing up the Decrees and Settlements; it is a bold intru&s;ion, and little better than defying and trampling under foot the &V;nity, Love, Ho|nour and Authority of the Churches, to run coun|ter with Synodical Settlements, till they are fairly Repealed by the like Power which made the Settle|ments.</HI> And thus we come to con&s;ider the Members of the Synods of the Primitive Chur|hes.</P>
<P>And the&s;e were Bi&s;hops, Presbyters, Deacons, and Deputed Lay-men, in behalf of the People

I &s;hall conclude this Head or De|mon&s;tration with the&s;e Weighty and Solemn Words of the Learned and Famous Mr. <HI>Oakes,</HI> Prae&s;ident of the Colledge, in his Election Ser|mon. <HI>Con&s;ider</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>what will be the End of Receding, or making of a Defection from the way of Church Government E&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t us. I profe&s;s that I look upon the Di&s;covery and Settle|ment of the Congregational Way, as the Boon, the Gratuity, the large&s;s of Divine Bounty, which the Lord graciou&s;ly be&s;towed on this People, that fol|lowed him into this Wilderne&s;s, and who were, &s;e|parated from their Brethren. Tho&s;e Good People who came over had more Love, Zeal, and affectio|nate de&s;ire of Communion with God, in pure Wor|&s;hip and Ordinances, and did more in order to it, than others; and the Lord did more for them than for any People in the World, in &s;hewing them the Pattern of his Hou&s;e, and the truer Scriptural-way of Church-Government and Admini&s;trations. God was certainly in a more than ordinary way pre&s;ent with his Servants, in laying of our Foundations; and in &s;ettling Church-Order, according to the Will and Appointment of Chri&s;t.</HI> Con&s;ider <HI>what will be the &s;ad i&s;&s;ue of Revolting from the way fixed on to one extream or to another, whether it be to Presbyte|riani&s;m or Browni&s;m.</HI>
<Q>As for the Presbyteri|ans, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that there are a|mong&s;t them, as Pious, Learned, Sober, Or|thodox Men, as the World affords; and that there is as much of the Power of Godline&s;s a|mong that Party, and of the Spirit of the good old Puritans, as among any People in the World. And as for the Ways of their Church
<PB N="29" REF="001941_0028_0FBA206601D350D0">
Government, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that in the day of it, it was a very con&s;iderable &s;tep to Reformation. The Reformation in King <HI>Ed|ward's</HI> Days, was a ble&s;&s;ed work; and the Re|formation of <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> was then a larger &s;tep, and in many re&s;pects purer than the other. And for my part, I fully believe that the Congregational-way far exceeds both, and is the highe&s;t &s;tep that has been taken to|wards Reformation; and for the &s;ub&s;tance of it, it is the very &s;ame way that was E&s;tabli&s;h|ed and Practi&s;ed in the Primitive Times, ac|cording to the In&s;titution of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q>
Thus ends my fir&s;t Demon&s;tration in a fair pa|rallel drawn up between the Holie&s;t Churches that ever were in the World, and the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI>; and however they may differ in their Morals, they are very harmonious in their Order. And con&s;idering that the former cannot rationally be thought but they derived their Con&s;titution from the Apo&s;tles, and &s;o it mu&s;t needs be of a Divine Original: And if &s;o, then the&s;e in <HI>New-England</HI> who are fa&s;hioned &s;o exactly like them, mu&s;t needs be of the &s;ame Pedigree, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But I &s;hall wave all Improvement of the Premi&s;es, and leave the whole to the &s;e|rious and judicious thoughts of every Impartial Reader, not doubting but he will find &s;ufficient evidence of the Divine Original of the&s;e Churches in what has been &s;aid. And that I might now obtain a <HI>Super&s;edeas,</HI> and forbear adding any fur|ther Plea in their Defence. But yet to gratifie my own Curio&s;ity, and divert the Reader, I &s;hall proceed to Inquire into the Natural Rea&s;on of the Con&s;titution of tho&s;e Churches we have been comparing, In this Que&s;tion I &s;hall go out

<P>THE Divine E&s;tabli&s;hment in Providence of the fore-named Churches in their Order is apparently the Royal a&s;&s;ent of the &s;upream Monarch of the Churches, to the grave Deci&s;ions of Rea&s;on in favour of Mans Natural &s;tate of Being, and Original Free|dom. For it we &s;hould make a new <HI>Survey</HI> of the Con&s;titution before named under the brighte&s;t Light of Nature, there is no grea|ter

Example of natural Wi&s;dom in any &s;et|lement on Earth; for the pre&s;ent and fu|ture &s;ecurity of Humane Beings in all that is mo&s;t Valuable and Grand, then in this. That it &s;eems to me as though Wi&s;e and Provident Nature by the Dictates of Right Rea&s;on excited by the moving Sugge&s;tions of Humanity; and awed with the ju&s;t demands of Natural Libertie, Equity, Equality, and Principles of Self-Pre&s;ervation, Originally drew up the Scheme, and then obtained the Royal Approbation. And certainly it is agreeable that we attribute it to God whether we re|ceive it nextly from Rea&s;on or Revelation, for that each is equally an Emanation of his Wi&s;dom, <HI>Prov.</HI> 20.27. The Spirit of Man is the Candle of the Lord, &s;earching all the in|ward parts of the Belly. There be many larger Volumns in this dark Rece&s;s called the Belly to be read by that Candle God has Light up. And I am very well a&s;&s;ured the fore named Con&s;titution is a Tran&s;cript out of &s;ome of their Pages, Joh. 1.4, 9. <HI>And the Life was the Light of Men, which Lighteth every Man which cometh into the World.</HI> This admirable Effect of Chri&s;ts Creating Power in hanging out &s;o many Lights to guide man through a dark World, is as Applicable to the Light of Rea&s;on, as to that of Revelati|on.

<HEAD>CHAP II.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. I Shall di&s;clo&s;e &s;everal Principles of Na|tural Knowledge; plainly di&s;covering the Law of Nature; or the true &s;entiments of Natural Rea&s;on, with Re&s;pect to Mans Be|ing and Government. And in this E&s;&s;ay I &s;hall peculiarly confine the di&s;cour&s;e to two heads, <HI>viz</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Of the Natural [in di&s;tinction to the Civil] and then,</P>
<P N="2">2. Of the Civil Being of Man. And I &s;hall Principally take Baron <HI>Puffendorff</HI> for my Chief Guide and Spoke&s;-man.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="33" REF="001941_0032_0FBA20704B02BDA8">1. I &s;hall con&s;ider Man in a &s;tate of Na|tural Being, as a Free-Born Subject under the Crown of Heaven, and owing Homage to none but God him&s;elf. It is certain Civil Govern|ment in General, is a very Admirable Re&s;ult of Providence, and an Incomparable Benefit to Man-kind, yet mu&s;t needs be acknow|ledged to be the Effect of Humane Free-Compacts and not of Divine In&s;titution; it is the Produce of Mans Rea&s;on, of Humane and Rational Combinations, and not from any direct Orders of Infinite Wi&s;dom, in any po&s;itive Law wherein is drawn up this or that Scheme of Civil Government. Govern|ment [&s;ays the Lord <HI>Warrington</HI>] is nece&s;&s;a|ry &mdash; in that no Society of Men can &s;ub|&s;i&s;t without it; and that Particular Form of Government is nece&s;&s;ary which be&s;t &s;uits the Temper and Inclination of a People. No|thing can be Gods Ordinance, but what he has particularly Declared to be &s;uch; there is no particularly Form of Civil Government de&s;cribed in Gods Word, neither does Nature prompt it. The Government of the <HI>Jews</HI> was changed five Times. Government is not formed by Nature, as other Births or Pro|ductions; If it were, it would be the &s;ame in all Countries; becau&s;e Nature keeps the &s;ame Method, in the &s;ame thing, in all Climates. If a Common Wealth be changed into a Mo|narchy, is it Nature that forms, and brings forth the Monarch? Or if a Royal Family
<PB N="34" REF="001941_0033_0FBA2071570595D0">
wholly Extinct [as in <HI>Noah's</HI> Ca&s;e, being not Heir Apparent from De&s;cent from <HI>Adam</HI>] is it. Nature that mu&s;t go to work [with the King Bees, who them&s;elves alone pre&s;erve the Royal Race in that Empire] to Breed a Monarch before the People can have a King, or a Government &s;ent over them? And thus we mu&s;t leave Kings to Re&s;olve which is their be&s;t Title to their Crowns, whether Natural Right, or the Con&s;titution of Go|vernment &s;ettled by Humane Compacts, un|der the Direction and Conduct of Rea&s;on. But to proceed under the head of a State of Natural Being, I &s;hall more di&s;tinctly Explain the State of Humane Nature in its Original Capacity, as Man is placed on Earth by his Maker, and Cloathed with many Inve&s;titures, and Immunities which properly belong to Man &s;eparately con&s;idered. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Prime Immunity in Mans State, is that he is mo&s;t properly the Subject of the Law of Nature. He is the Favourite Ani|mal on Earth; in that this Part of Gods I|mage, <HI>viz.</HI> Rea&s;on is Congenate with his Na|ture, wherein by a Law Immutable, In&s;tampt upon his Frame, God has provided a Rule for Men in all their Actions, obliging each one to the performance of that which is Right, not only as to Ju&s;tice, but likewi&s;e as to all other Moral Vertues, the which is no|thing but the Dictate of Right Rea&s;on found|ed in the Soul of Man. <HI>Malloy, De. Mao,
<PB N="35" REF="001941_0034_0FBA2073E97A31D0">
Praef.</HI> That which is to be drawn from Mans Rea&s;on, flowing from the true Current of that Faculty, when unperverted, may be &s;aid to be the Law of Nature; on which account, the Holy Scriptures declare it written on Mens hearts. For being indowed with a Soul, you may know from your &s;elf, how, and what you ought to act, Rom. 2.14. <HI>The&s;e having not a Law, are a Law to them&s;elves.</HI> So that the meaning is, when we acknow|ledge the Law of Nature to be the dictate of Right Rea&s;on, we mu&s;t mean that the Under&s;tanding of Man is Endowed with &s;uch a power, as to be able, from the Comtempla|tion of humane Condition to di&s;cover a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Living agreeably with this Law: And likewi&s;e to find out &s;ome Principle, by which the Precepts of it, may be clearly and &s;olidly Demon&s;trated. The way to di&s;cover the Law of Nature in our own &s;tate, is by a narrow Watch, and accurate Contemplation of our Natural Condition, and propen&s;ions. Others &s;ay this is the way to find out the Law of Nature. <HI>&s;cil.</HI> If a Man any ways doubts, whether what he is going to do to another Man be agreeable to the Law of Nature, then let him &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf to be in that other Mans Room; And by this Rule effectually Executed. A Man mu&s;t be a very dull Scho|lar to Nature not to make Proficiency in the Knowledge of her Laws. But more Particu|larly in pur&s;uing our Condition for the di&s;|covery
<PB N="36" REF="001941_0035_0FBA2075A67A76C0">
of the Law of Nature, this is very obvious to view, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. A Principle of Self-Love, &amp; Self-Pre&s;erva|tion, is very predominant in every Mans Being.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Sociable Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P N="3">3. An Affection or Love to Man-kind in General. And to give &s;uch Sentiments the force of a Law, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e a God who takes care of all Mankind, and has thus obliged each one, as a Subject of higher Principles of Being, then meer In&s;tincts. For that all Law properly con&s;idered, &s;uppo&s;es a capable Subject, and a Superiour Power; And the Law of God which is Binding, is publi&s;hed by the Dictates of Right Rea&s;on as other ways: Therefore &s;ays <HI>Plutarch, To fol|low God and obey Rea&s;on is the &s;ame thing.</HI> But moreover that God has E&s;tabli&s;hed the Law of Nature, as the General Rule of Govern|ment, is further Illu&s;trable from the many Sanctions in Providence, and from the Peace and Guilt of Con&s;cience in them that either obey, or violate the Law of Nature. But moreover, the foundation of the Law of Na|ture with relation to Government, may be thus Di&s;covered. <HI>&s;cil.</HI> Man is a Creature ex|treamly de&s;irous of his own Pre&s;ervation; of him&s;elf he is plainly Expo&s;ed to many Wants, unable to &s;ecure his own &s;afety, and Mainte|nance without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his fellows; and he is al&s;o able of returning Kindne&s;s by the furtherance of mutual Good; But yet Man is often found to be Malicious, In&s;olent,
<PB N="37" REF="001941_0036_0FBA20780871FCC0">
and ea&s;ily Provoked, and as powerful in Ef|fecting mi&s;chief, as he is ready in de&s;igning it. Now that &s;uch a Creature may be Pre|&s;erved, it is nece&s;&s;ary that he be Sociable; that is, that he be capable and di&s;po&s;ed to unite him&s;elf to tho&s;e of his own &s;pecies, and to Regulate him&s;elf towards them, that they may have no fair Rea&s;on to do him harm; but rather incline to promote his Intere&s;ts, and &s;ecure his Rights and Concerns. This then is a Fundamental Law of Nature, that every Man as far as in him lies, do main|tain a Sociablene&s;s with others, agreeable with the main end and di&s;po&s;ition of humane Nature in general. For this is very apparent, that Rea&s;on and Society render Man the mo&s;t potent of all Creatures. And Finally, from the Principles of Sociablene&s;s it follows as a fundamental Law of Nature, that Man is not &s;o Wedded to his own Intere&s;t, but that he can make the Common good the mark of his Aim: And hence he becomes Capacitated to enter into a Civil State by the Law of Na|ture; for without this property in Nature, <HI>viz.</HI> Sociablene&s;s, which is for Cementing of parts, every Government would &s;oon moulder and di&s;&s;olve.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Second Great Immunity of Man is an Original Liberty In&s;tampt upon his Rational Nature. He that intrudes up|on this Liberty, Violates the Law of Na|ture. In this Di&s;cour&s;e I &s;hall wave
<PB N="38" REF="001941_0037_0FBA207AACBB4758">
the Con&s;ideration of Mans Moral Turpitude, but &s;hall view him Phy&s;ically as a Creature which God has made and furni&s;hed e&s;&s;enti|ally with many Enobling Immunities, which render him the mo&s;t Augu&s;t Animal in the World, and &s;till, whatever has happened &s;ince his Creation, he remains at the upper-end of Nature, and as &s;uch is a Creature of a very Noble Character. For as to his Dominion, the whole frame of the Lower Part of the Univer&s;e is devoted to his u&s;e, and at his Command; and his Liberty under the Con|duct of Right Rea&s;on, is equal with his tru&s;t. Which Liberty may be briefly Con&s;idered, Internally as to his Mind, and Externally as to his Per&s;on.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Internal Native Liberty of Mans Nature in general implies, a faculty of Doing or Omitting things according to the Direction of his Judgment. But in a more &s;pecial mean|ing, this Liberty does not con&s;i&s;t in a loo&s;e and ungovernable Freedom, or in an unbound|ed Licence of Acting. Such Licence is di&s;a|greeing with the condition and dignity of Man, and would make Man of a lower and meaner Con&s;titution then Bruit Creatures; who in all their Liberties are kept under a better and more Rational Government, by their In&s;tincts. Therefore as <HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Tho&s;e Per&s;ons only who live in Obedience to Rea&s;on, are worthy to be accounted free: They alone live as they Will, who have Learnt what they ought to Will.</HI> So
<PB N="39" REF="001941_0038_0FBA207C88F9D618">
that the true Natural Liberty of Man, &s;uch as really and truely agrees to him, mu&s;t be under&s;tood, as he is Guided and Re&s;trained by the Tyes of Rea&s;on, and Laws of Nature; all the re&s;t is Brutal, if not wor&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mans External Per&s;onal, Natural Liber|ty, Antecedent to all Humane parts, or Al|liances mu&s;t al&s;o be con&s;idered. And &s;o eve|ry Man mu&s;t be conceived to be perfectly in his own Power and di&s;po&s;al, and not to be controuled by the Authority of any other. And thus every Man, mu&s;t be acknowledged equal to every Man, &s;ince all Subjection and all Command are equally bani&s;hed on both &s;ides; and con&s;idering all Men thus at Liber|ty, every Man has a Prerogative to Judge for him&s;elf, <HI>viz.</HI> What &s;hall be mo&s;t for his Be|hoof, Happine&s;s and Well-being.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Third Capital Immunity belonging to Mans Nature, is an equality among&s;t Men; Which is not to be denyed by the Law of Nature, till Man has Re&s;igned him&s;elf with all his Rights for the &s;ake of a Civil State; and then his Per&s;onal Liberty and Equality is to be cheri&s;hed, and pre&s;erved to the high|e&s;t degree, as will con&s;i&s;t with all ju&s;t di&s;tincti|ons among&s;t Men of Honour, and &s;hall be a|greeable with the publick Good. For Man has a high valuation of him&s;elf, and the pa&s;&s;ion &s;eems to lay its fir&s;t foundation [not in Pride, but] really in the high and admi|rable Frame and Con&s;titution of Humane
<PB N="40" REF="001941_0039_0FBA2080F53DBED8">
Nature. The Word Man, &s;ays my Author, is thought to carry &s;omewhat of Dignity in its &s;ound; and we commonly make u&s;e of this as the mo&s;t proper and prevailing Ar|gument again&s;t a rude In&s;ulter, <HI>viz. I am not a Beast or a Dog, but am a Man as well as your &s;elf.</HI> Since then Humane Nature agrees e|qually with all per&s;ons; and &s;ince no one can live a Sociable Life with another that does not own or Re&s;pect him as a Man; It follows as a Command of the Law of Na|ture, that every Man E&s;teem and treat ano|ther as one who is naturally his Equal, or who is a Man as well as he. There be ma|ny popular, or plau&s;ible Rea&s;ons that greatly Illu&s;trate this Equality, <HI>viz.</HI> that we all De|rive our Being from one &s;tock, the &s;ame Common Father of humane Race. On this Con&s;ideration <HI>Boethius</HI> checks the pride of the In&s;ulting Nobility.</P>

<P>And al&s;o that our Bodies are Compo&s;ed of matter, frail, brittle, and lyable to be de|&s;troyed by thou&s;and Accidents; we all owe our Exi&s;tence to the &s;ame Method of propa|gation. The Noble&s;t Mortal in his Entrance on to the Stage of Life, is not di&s;tingui&s;hed by any pomp or of pa&s;&s;age from the lowe&s;t of Mankind; and our Life ha&s;tens to the &s;ame General Mark: Death ob&s;erves no Ce|remony, but Knocks as loud at the Barriers of the Court, as at the Door of the Cottage. This Equality being admitted, bears a very great force in maintaining Peace and Friend|&s;hip among&s;t Men. For that he who would u&s;e the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of others, in promoting his own Advantage, ought as freely to be at their &s;ervice, when they want his help on the like Occa&s;ions. <HI>One Good turn Requires another,</HI> is the Common Proverb; for otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t need e&s;teem others unequal to him&s;elf, who con&s;tantly demands their Aid, and as con&s;tantly denies his own. And whoever is of this In&s;olent Temper, cannot but highly di&s;plea&s;e tho&s;e about him, and &s;oon give Oc|ca&s;ion of the Breach of the Common Peace. It was a Manly Reproof which <HI>Charact<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">cus</HI>

gave the <HI>Romans. Num Si vos Omnibus</HI> &amp;c. What! becau&s;e you de&s;ire to be Ma&s;ters of all Men, does it follow therefore that all Men &s;hould de&s;ire to be your Slaves, for that it is a Command of Natures Law, that no Man that has not obtained a particular and &s;pecial Right, &s;hall arrogate to him&s;elf a Larger &s;hare then his fellows, but &s;hall ad|mit others to equal Priviledges with him&s;elf. So that the Principle of Equality in a Na|tural State, is peculiarly tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed by Pride, which is when a Man without &s;ufficient rea|&s;on prefers him&s;elf to others.

<P N="2">2. To con&s;ider Man in a Civil State of Being; wherein we &s;hall ob&s;erve the great difference betwen a Natural, and Political State; for in the latter State many Great di&s;proportions appear, or at lea&s;t many obvious di&s;tinctions are &s;oon made among&s;t Men; which Doctrine is to be laid open under a few heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. Every Man con&s;idered in a Natural State, mu&s;t be allowed to be Free, and at his own di&s;po&s;e; yet to &s;uit Mans Inclinations to Soci|ety; And in a peculiar manner to gratify the nece&s;&s;ity he is in of publick Rule and Order, he is Impelled to enter into a Civil Community; and Dive&s;ts him&s;elf of his Natural Freedom, and puts him&s;elf under Government; which a|mong&s;t other things Comprehends the Power of Life and Death over Him; together with Au|thority to Injoyn him &s;ome things to which he has an utter Aver&s;ation, and to prohibit him other things, for which he may have as &s;trong an Inclination; &s;o that he may be often under this Authority, obliged to Sacrifice his Private, for the Publick Good. So that though Man is inclined to Society, yet he is driven to a Combination by great nece&s;&s;ity. For that the true and leading Cau&s;e of forming Governments, and yielding up Natural Liberty, and throw|ing Mans Equality into a Common Pile to be new Ca&s;t by the Rules of fellow&s;hip; was really and truly to guard them&s;elves again&s;t the Inju|ries
<PB N="44" REF="001941_0043_0FBA208C4181E128">
Men were lyable to Interchangeably; for none &s;o Good to Man, as Man, and yet none a greater Enemy. So that,</P>
<P N="2">2. The fir&s;t Humane Subject and Original of Civil Power is the People. For as they have a Power every Man over him&s;elf in a Natural State, &s;o upon a Combination they can and do bequeath this Power unto others; and &s;ettle it according as their united di&s;cretion &s;hall Determine. For that this is very plain, that when the Subject of Sovereign Power is quite Extinct, that Power returns to the People a|gain. And when they are free, they may &s;et up what &s;pecies of Government they plea&s;e; or if they rather incline to it, they may &s;ub&s;ide into a State of Natural Being, if it be plainly for the be&s;t.

<P N="3">3. The formal Rea&s;on of Government is the Will of a Community, yielded up and &s;ur|rendred to &s;ome other Subject, either of one particular Per&s;on, or more, Conveyed in the following manner.</P>
<P>Let us conceive in our Mind a multitude of Men, all Naturally Free &amp; Equal; going about voluntarily, to Erect them&s;elves into a new Common-Wealth. Now their Condition being

&s;uch, to bring them&s;elves into a Politick Body, they mu&s;t needs Enter into divers Covenants.</P>
<P N="1">1. They mu&s;t Interchangeably each Man Co|venant to joyn in one la&s;ting Society, that they may be capable to concert the mea&s;ures of their &s;afety, by a Publick Vote.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Vote or Decree mu&s;t then nextly pa&s;s to &s;et up &s;ome Particular &s;peecies of Govern|ment over them. And if they are joyned in their fir&s;t Compact upon ab&s;olute Terms to &s;tand to the Deci&s;ion of the fir&s;t Vote con|cerning the Species of Government: Then all are bound by the Majority to acquie&s;ce in that particular Form thereby &s;ettled, though their own private Opinion, incline them to &s;ome other Model.</P>
<P N="3">3. After a Decree has &s;pecified the Particular form of Government, then there will be need of a New Covenant, whereby tho&s;e on whom Sovereignty is conferred, engage to take care of the Common Peace, and Welfare. And the Subjects on the other hand, to yield them faith|ful Obedience. In which Covenant is Included that Submi&s;&s;ion and Union of Wills, by which a State may be conceived to be but one Per&s;on. So that the mo&s;t proper Definition of a Civil State, is this. <HI>viz.</HI> A Civil State is a Compound Moral Per&s;on. who&s;e Will [United by tho&s;e Covenants before pa&s;&s;ed] is the Will of all; to the end it may U&s;e, and Apply the &s;trength and riches of Private Per&s;ons towards main|taining the Common Peace, Security, and Well-being of all. Which may be conceived as tho' the whole State was now become but one Man; in which the afore&s;aid Covenants may be &s;up|po&s;ed under Gods Providence, to be the Di|vine

This Form of Govern|ment, appears in the greate&s;t part of the World to have been the mo&s;t Ancient. For that Rea|&s;on &s;eems to &s;hew it to be mo&s;t probable, that when Men [being Originally in a condition of Natural Freedom and Equality] had thoughts of joyning in a Civil Body, would without que&s;|tion be inclined to Admini&s;ter their common Affairs, by their common Judgment, and &s;o mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily to gratifie that Inclination e&s;tabli&s;h a Democracy; neither can it be rationally i|magined, that Fathers of Families being yet Free and Independent, &s;hould in a moment, or

little time take off their long delight in govern|ing their own Affairs, &amp; Devolve all upon &s;ome &s;ingle Sovereign Commander; for that it &s;eems to have been thought more Equitable, that what belonged to all, &s;hould be managed by all, when all had entered by Compact into one Commu|nity.

is the highe&s;t Cau&s;e that acts by Council; and it mu&s;t needs be altogether repugnant, to think he &s;hould fore-ca&s;t the State of this World by no better a Scheme, than to Or|der two Sovereign Powers, in the &s;ame Grand Community, which would be like placing two Suns in the Firmament, which would be to &s;et the Univer&s;e into a Flame: That &s;hould &s;uch an Error happen, one mu&s;t needs be forth|with Extingui&s;hed, to bring the Frame of Nature into a ju&s;t Temper, and keep it out of harms way. But to proceed with my Pur|po&s;e, I &s;hall go back upon the Civil Scheme, and inquire after two things: Fir&s;t of Rebel|lion again&s;t Government in general, and then in &s;pecial; whether any of the afore&s;aid Spe|cies of Regular Government can be predica|ble of the Church of God on Earth.</P>
<P N="1">1. In General concerning Rebellion again&s;t Government for Particular Subjects to break in upon Regular Communities duly E&s;tabli&s;hed, is from the premi&s;es to Violate the Law of Nature; and is a high U&s;urpation upon the fir&s;t grand Immunities of Mankind. Such Rebels in States, and U&s;urpers in Churches affront the World, with a pre&s;umption that the Be&s;t of the Brotherhood are a Company of Fools, and that them&s;elves have fairly Monopolized all the Rea&s;on of Humane Nature. Yea, they take up|on them the Boldne&s;s to a&s;&s;ume a Prerogative of trampling under foot the natural original E|quality &amp; Liberty of their Fellows; for to pu&s;h the Proprietors of Settlements out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of their old, and impo&s;e new Schemes upon them, is vertually to declare them in a &s;tate of Va&s;&s;alage, or that they were Born &s;o; and
<PB N="53" REF="001941_0052_0FBA20A0904C9798">
therefore will the U&s;urper be &s;o gracious as to in&s;ure them they &s;hall not be Sold at the next Market: They mu&s;t e&s;teem it a favour, for by this time all the Original Prerogatives of Man's Nature are intentionally a Victim, &s;moaking to &s;atiate the U&s;urpers Ambition. It is a very tart Ob&s;ervation on an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Monarch, and where it may by proportion be applied to a Subject mu&s;t needs &s;ink very deep, and &s;erve for evi|dence under this Head.

<P N="2">2. In &s;pecial I &s;hall now proceed to Enquire, Whether any of the afore&s;aid Species of regular, unmixt Governments, can with any good &s;hew of Rea&s;on be predicable of the Church of Chri&s;t on Earth. If the Churches of Chri&s;t, as Chur|ches, are either the Object or Subject of a Sove|reign Power intru&s;ted in the hands of Men, then mo&s;t certainly one of the fore-cited Schemes of a perfect Government will be applicable to it.</P>
<P>Before I pur&s;ue the Enquiry, it may not be improper to pau&s;e, &amp; make &s;ome Caution here,

by di&s;tingui&s;hing between that which may have &s;ome Re&s;emblance of Civil Power, and the thing it &s;elf; and &s;o the Power of Churches is but a faint Re&s;emblance of Civil Power; it comes in reality nothing near to the thing it &s;elf; for the one is truly Coercive, the other per&s;wa&s;ive; the one is Sovereign Power, the o|ther is Delegated and Mini&s;terial: But not to delay, I &s;hall proceed with my Enquiry, and therein &s;hall endeavour to humour the &s;everal great Claimers of Government in the Church of Chri&s;t. And</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;hall begin with a Monarchy. It's cer|tain, his Holine&s;s, either by rea&s;onable Pleas, or powerful Cheats, has a&s;&s;umed an ab&s;olute and univer&s;al Sovereignty; this fills his Cathedral Chair, and is adorned with a Triple Crown, and in Defence thereof does prote&s;t, <HI>The Al|mighty has made him bath Key-keeper of Heaven and Hell, with the adjacent Territories of Purga|tory, and ve&s;ted in him an ab&s;olute Sovereignty o|ver the Chri&s;tian World.</HI> And his Right has &s;o far prevailed, that Princes and Civil Monarchs hold their Crowns and Donations as his Dutiful Sons, and Loyal Subjects; he therefore decks him&s;elf with the Spoils of the Divine Attributes, &s;tiling him&s;elf, <HI>Our Lord God, Optimum, Maximum et &s;upremum numen in Terris</HI>; a God on Earth, a vi&s;ible Deity, and that his Power is ab&s;olute, &amp; his Wi&s;dom infallible. And many of the great Potentates of the Earth have paid their Fealty, as tho' it was really &s;o. One of them Clad in Canvas, going Bare-foot in the depth of Win|ter, [in Obedience to the Decree, &s;tinting the Pennance in proportion to the Wickedne&s;s of Princes] has waited many days for ab&s;olution
<PB N="55" REF="001941_0054_0FBA20A4DE36ECA0">
at hpious Gates. Another has thrown him|&s;elf down pro&s;trate a humble Penitent before him: He has placed his Holy Foot on the Mo|narchs profane Neck as cru&s;hing a Vermine, crawling out of the Stable of his Soveraighty; and others frequently ki&s;s his Toes with very profound Devotion. The&s;e and &s;uch like Tri|umphant Signals of his Sovereign Power does he wear. And indeed if he is the Univer&s;al Mo|narch of the Catholick Church, Princes that are Members of it mu&s;t needs knock under; for that in one World there can not po&s;&s;ibly be two <HI>Mo&s;t High</HI>'s, any more than two <HI>Infinites.</HI> Thus you &s;ee the Clergy, or Go&s;pel Mini&s;try of the Chri&s;tian World have &s;o wi&s;ely handled bu&s;ine&s;s, and managed the Go&s;pel, that they have fairly [as they avouch] &s;ound a Sovereign Power be|queathed in it to the Mini&s;try of Chri&s;t, and romaging more warily and nicely, at la&s;t found a Spiritual Monarch, very compleatly furni&s;hed with the Keys of all &s;orts of Power hanging at his Girdle; and may we not pronounce the wi|&s;er they! &s;eeing the World growing weary of Religion, was willing to loll it &s;elf down to Sleep, and leave them in &s;ole Tru&s;t with the whole Intere&s;t of God's Kingdom. But the &s;ad Enquiry is, Whether this &s;ort of Government has not plainly &s;ubverted the De&s;ign of the Go&s;|pel, and the end for which Chri&s;t's Government was Ordained, <HI>viz.</HI> the Moral, Spiritual, and Eternal Happine&s;s of Men?</P>
<P>But I have no occa&s;ion to pur&s;ue this Remark with tedious Demon&s;trations: It's very plain, it's written with Blood in Capital Letters, to be Read at Midnight by the Flames of <HI>Smith|field,</HI> and other &s;uch like con&s;ecrated Fires.

That the Government of this Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Mo|narch has in&s;tead of Sanctifying, ab&s;olutely De|baucht the World, and &s;ubverted all good Chri|&s;tianity in it.

<P>It is very plain [allowing me to &s;peak Emblematically] the Primitive Con&s;titution of the Churches was a Democracy, as appears by the foregoing Parallel.

The cau&s;e &s;eemed to be &s;o very &s;pe|cious, that nothing could be more Decent, or more Conducive to the &s;afety of the Com|mon-Wealth.</P>
<P>Yet [&s;ays my Author] if you do well weigh the bu&s;ine&s;s, you mu&s;t needs acknow|ledge nothing could have happened more Pernicious or De&s;tructive to the Church of God. For &s;oon after the&s;e things came to pa&s;s, it is very obvious, that Tyranny over the Con&s;ciences of the faithful; and an In|tolerable Pride every where grew Rampant among the guides of the Church. Yet there was one thing &s;till very needful to be done; and that was to E&s;tabli&s;h or Confirm the Power which the Metropolitans and Bi&s;hops had acquired to them&s;elves. Therefore they fell to it Tooth and Nail to drive away the Fraternity from all Intere&s;t in Elections: And alas Poor hearts! They began to &s;leep with both Ears; that then was &s;carce any Ene|my

left to Interrupt, or Controul the Con|querors. This was the manner of the Clergy till they had made them&s;elves the Subjects of all Power and then acted Arbitrarily, and did what they plea&s;ed in the Church of God.</P>
<P>But let the learned, knowing World, con&s;ider, what the I&s;&s;ue of all this was, <HI>&s;cil.</HI> what a wretched capacity the drow&s;ine&s;s &amp; cowardize of the People; and the U&s;urpati|on and Ambition of the Mini&s;try brought the Profe&s;&s;ing World into. If tho&s;e who were truely Godly on both &s;ides had in a few Ages lookt down from Heaven, and had Eyed the following Centurys, they might have beheld a world of matter for &s;orrowful Impre&s;&s;ions; to think that they them&s;elves had Occa&s;ioned the Ruin of Millions, by their remi&s;s and pa&s;&s;ive temper in one &s;ort; and too much humouring, and nouri&s;hing Pride, and high conceits of them&s;elves and others, in the other; when as if they had &s;tood firm to the Government as left &s;ettled by the Apo&s;tles; they had certainly pre|vented an Apo&s;tacy that has damned, and confounded a great part of about Thirty Generations of Men, Women, and Children. That for my own part I can upon Experi|ence, in &s;ome mea&s;ure truly &s;ay [to the Hi&s;|tory of the Primitive Churches in the lo&s;s of their Government; and the Con&s;equents which followed, when I am Impelled to re|peat it to my &s;elf] as one <HI>Eneas</HI> &s;aid to Queen <HI>Dido.</HI></P>

<P>In a Word, an Ari&s;tocracy is a dangerous Con&s;titution in the Church of Chri&s;t, as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Presbytery of all Church Power: What has been ob&s;erved &s;ufficiently Evinces it.

But to abbreviate; it &s;eems mo&s;t agreeable with the Light of Nature, that if there be any of the Regular Government &s;ettled in the Church of God it mu&s;t needs be.</P>
<P N="3">3. A Democracy. This is a form of Go|vernment, which the Light of Nature does highly value, &amp; often directs to as mo&s;t agree|able to the Ju&s;t and Natural Prerogatives of Humane Beings. This was of great account, in the early times of the World. And not only &s;o, but upon the Experience of &s;everal Thou&s;and years, after the World had been tumbled, and to&s;t from one Species of Go|vernment to another, at a great Expence of Blood and Trea&s;ure, many of the wi&s;e Nati|ons

of the World have &s;heltered them&s;elves under it again; or at lea&s;t have blendi&s;hed, and balanced their Governments with it.</P>
<P>It is certainly a great Truth, <HI>&s;cil.</HI> That Mans Original Liberty after it is Re&s;igned, [yet under due Re&s;trictions] ought to be Che|ri&s;hed in all wi&s;e Governments; or otherwi&s;e a man in making him&s;elf a Subject, he alters him&s;elf from a Freeman, into a Slave, which to do is Repugnant to the Law of Nature. Al&s;o the Natural Equality of Men among&s;t Men mu&s;t be duly favoured; in that Govern|ment was never E&s;tabli&s;hed by God or Na|ture, to give one Man a Prerogative to in|&s;ult over another; therefore in a Civil, as well as in a Natural State of Being, a ju&s;t Equality is to be indulged &s;o far as that eve|ry Man is bound to Honour every Man, which is agreeable both with Nature and Religion, 1 Pet. 2.17. <HI>Honour all Men.</HI> &mdash; The End of all good Government is to Cul|tivate Humanity, and Promote the happine&s;s of all, and the good of every Man in all his Rights, his Life, Liberty, E&s;tate, Honour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without injury or abu&s;e done to any. Then certainly it cannot ea&s;ily be thought, that a company of Men, that &s;hall enter into a voluntary Compact, to hold all Power in their own hands, thereby to u&s;e and im|prove their united force, wi&s;dom, riches and &s;trength for the Common and Particular good of every Member, as is the Nature of a De|mocracy;
<PB N="62" REF="001941_0061_0FBA20B116E6D6B8">
I &s;ay it cannot be that this &s;ort of Con&s;titution, will &s;o readily furni&s;h tho&s;e in Government with an appetite, or di&s;po&s;i|tion to prey upon each other, or imbezle the common Stock; as &s;ome Particular Per&s;ons may be apt to do when &s;et off, and Intru&s;ted with the &s;ame Power. And moreover this appears very Natural, that when the afore&s;aid Government or Power, &s;ettled in all, when they have Elected certain capable Per&s;ons to Mini&s;ter in their affairs, and the &s;aid Mini|&s;ters remain accountable to the A&s;&s;embly; the&s;e Officers mu&s;t needs be under the influ|ence of many wi&s;e cautions from their own thoughts [as well as under confinement by their Commi&s;&s;ion] in their whole Admini|&s;tration: And from thence it mu&s;t needs fol|low that they will be more apt, and inclined to &s;teer Right for the main Point, <HI>viz.</HI> The peculiar good, and benefit of the whole, and every particular Member fairly and &s;incerely.

<P>For certainly if Chri&s;t has &s;ettled any form of Power in his Church he has done it for his Churches &s;afety, and for the Benefit of every Member: Then he mu&s;t needs be pre|&s;umed to have made choice of that Govern|ment as &s;hould lea&s;t Expo&s;e his People to Hazard, either from the fraud, or Arbitra|ry mea&s;ures of particular Men.

Government like a Democracy to attain this End.

Indeed &s;ome very wi&s;e and learned Men are plea&s;ed to Inveigh, and Repraoch the Notion of a Democracy in the Church, which makes the <HI>Cetu fidelium</HI> or Community of the Faithful the fir&s;t Subject of the Power of Government.

as Regular a form, and as particular as any other. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. An ab&s;olute or limited Monarch can't ma|nage the Power or Government Devolved upon him, without the great Officers of the Crown, or a large Sett of Mini&s;ters; tho' po&s;&s;ibly he may with quicker di&s;patch i&s;&s;ue out his Decrees, yet he mu&s;t Execute all by his Mini&s;try. And why may not a Democracy be indulged the &s;ame Liberty? and this will prevent all Anar|chy or Confu&s;ion mo&s;t apparently. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. The bitter Pill to &s;wallow in this Doc|trine of a Democracy in the Church, is the terrible power of Life and Death; or the ac|countablene&s;s of particular Members to the A&s;|&s;embly, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e in the Mini&s;try; but yet this is agreeable with the Nature of the Con&s;titution, and ea&s;ily managed without A|narchy, or popular Confu&s;ion al&s;o, which would be made very Evident, if we &s;hould but run the parallel in all points between the Democracy of the State and Church.

<P N="3">3. Infer, That if the&s;e Churches are not pro|perly formed, yet are fairly E&s;tabli&s;hed in their pre&s;ent Order by the Law of Nature. And will they be advi&s;ed, I would Exhort them to try who will be &s;o bold as to dare to di&s;&s;eize them. A Monarchy has been tryed in the Church with a witne&s;s, but it has ab&s;olutely failed us. An Ari&s;tocracy in a deep Calm threw the De|mocracy Overboard, and took not only the Helm in hand, but &s;eized Ship and Cargo as their Right and Title; but after &s;ome time brought all to Ship-wreck, and that in a good Harbour too.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="001941_0064_0FBA20BA77799960">A Democracy was the noble Government which beat out in all the bad Weather of Ten Bloody Per&s;ecutions under the management of Antiquity. And this is our Con&s;titution, and what can't we be plea&s;ed? This Con&s;titution is as agreeable with the Light and Laws of Na|ture as any other what&s;oever, as has been fairly laid down, and fully Evinced, and more accom|modated to the Concerns of Religion than any other. Therefore I &s;hall now conclude my Demon&s;tration with this brief Appeal to the common Rea&s;on of Mankind, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>How can it con&s;i&s;t with the Honourable Terms man holds upon here on Earth; that the be&s;t &s;ort of Men that we can find in the World; &s;uch men as are adorned with a dou|ble &s;ett of Enobling Immunities, the fir&s;t from Nature, the other from Grace; that the&s;e men when they enter into Charter-party to manage a Trade for Heaven, mu&s;t <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> be clapt un|der a Government, that is Arbitrary and Di&s;po|tick; yea that carries the plain &s;ymptoms of a Tyranny in it, when the Light of Nature knows of a better Species, and frequently has made u&s;e of it? It wants no farther Demon&s;tration, for it's mo&s;t apparent, that Nature is &s;o much Mi&s;|tre&s;s of her &s;elf, that man in a Natural State of Being, is under God the fir&s;t Subject of all Pow|er, and therefore can make his own Choice, and by deliberate Compacts &s;ettles his own Conditi|ons for the Government of him&s;elf in a Civil State of Being: And when a Government &s;o Settled &s;hall throw its &s;elf from its Foundations, or the Subjects of Sovereign Power &s;hall &s;ubvert or confound the Con&s;titution, they then degrade them&s;elves; and &s;o all Power returns again to
<PB N="66" REF="001941_0065_0FBA20BB85AF23A0">
the People, who are the fir&s;t Owners. And what! Is Man become &s;o unfortunate, degra|ded and deba&s;ed, as to be without all Power in &s;ettling a Government over him&s;elf, rela|ting to the Matters of his Eternal Well-Be|ing? Or when he comes back to a Fathers Hou&s;e, mu&s;t he fall into the Capacity of a meer pa&s;&s;ive Being, and be put under &s;uch Tutors, as can ea&s;ily turn Tyrants over him, and no relief left for him in his own hands; this is certainly mo&s;t repugnant to the Light of Nature, and very di&s;agreeable with the li|berty and free Genius of a Go&s;pel State. Nay, In a word, If the Government of the Churches be &s;ettled by God, either in the hands of a Church Monarch, or Ari&s;tocracy, and the People are no ways the Subject of Church-Power: Nay, if they are not under Chri&s;t, the fountain of Power; then the Reformation &s;o called, is but a meer Cheat, a Schi&s;m, and notorious Rebellion; neither is there room left for the lea&s;t palliation, or &s;hadow of Ex|cu&s;e, for the Reformers in renouncing their Obedience to their Publick Governours. And the Martyrologies which pretend to immor|talize the Fame of eminent Heroes, mu&s;t be changed into Chronicles, handing along an ac|count of the ju&s;t and de&s;erved fate of a crew of Rebels again&s;t God and Government; for what bu&s;ine&s;s had &s;uch a Company of illeterate and crack brain'd fellows to meddle with their Rulers, or Examine into their Admini&s;trati|ons? For if they have no right of Power in Government, they &s;tand ab&s;olutely bound to yield a pa&s;&s;ive Obedience and Non-Re&s;i&s;tance; and if they are &s;o hardy and daring as to op|po&s;e
<PB N="67" REF="001941_0066_0FBA20BD036114F0">
their lawful Rulers, the &s;harpe&s;t penalty in this World, is too ea&s;ie for them; the In|qui&s;ition is but dallying and playing with them, Hell is their de&s;ert. But how it comes about that a &s;tate of Grace, when in want of a &s;uita|ble Government, is become &s;uch a Va&s;&s;al, and wi&s;e and cunning Nature is by her Creator in|tru&s;ted, and adorned with more enobling Pre|rogatives, I mu&s;t leave; and re&s;ign unto tho&s;e Learned Men to Solve, who plead for an Ari&s;to|cracy in the Churches of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But to wind up the whole Di&s;cour&s;e in a few words, I acknowledge many Objections may be here made, and &s;everal Que&s;tions of Moment might here fall under Debate; but having ob|tained what I have principally &s;ought for, in traver&s;ing the paths of Nature, in the three fol|lowing Particulars; therefore with them, and with one Objection an&s;wered; and al&s;o with &s;ome brief Improvement of the Grand Hypothe|&s;is in this Demon&s;tration, I &s;hall fini&s;h the Ar|gument.</P>
<P N="1">1. Three Particulars; or &s;o many golden Maxims, &s;ecuring the Honour of Congregational Churches.</P>
<P>Particular 1. <HI>That the People or Fraternity under the Go&s;pel, are the fir&s;t Subject of Power; or el&s;e Religion &s;inks the Dignity of Humane Nature into a ba&s;er Capacity with relation to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, then it is in, in a Natural State of being with relation to Civil Government.</HI></P>
<P>Particular 2. <HI>That a Democracy in Church or State, is a very honourable and regular Govern|ment according to the Dictates of Right Rea&s;on.</HI> And therefore,</P>
<P>Particular 3. <HI>That the&s;e Churches of</HI> New-England,
<PB N="68" REF="001941_0067_0FBA20BF8F83F838">
<HI>in their ancient Con&s;titution of Church Order; it being a Democracy, are manife&s;tly Ju&s;ti|fied and Defended by the Law &amp; Light of Nature.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Objection. <HI>The Plea from the Law of Nature for a Democracy in the Church, is as for|ceable for any other Species of Government; be|cau&s;e Nature is furni&s;hed with &s;uch a variety of Schemes as has been pleaded to: And why may not the wi&s;e Chri&s;tian Nations take which likes them be&s;t?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> We mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between man left &s;olely to the Direction of the Law of Nature, and as the Subject of Revelation, wherein Di|vine Wi&s;dom may interpo&s;e; and determine on &s;ome particular Species, without hurting or cro&s;&s;ing the Law of Nature. Therefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. I readily grant and acknowledge, a Chri&s;|tian People may &s;ettle what Species of Govern|ment they plea&s;e, when they are &s;olely left to determine by the Law of Nature, what Govern|ment in the Church they will have. But then we mu&s;t remember, that by the Argument or Conce&s;&s;ion, the Power is originally in the Peo|ple; and then our own Ca&s;e is &s;ecure and &s;afe enough; both on the account of the Rever&s;ion of Power, and e&s;pecially, for that the People the fir&s;t Subjects of Power, have been plea&s;ed to &s;ettle a Democracy for their Government, in the Churches of this Country. And if after the peaceable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of about an hundred years, any per&s;ons can per&s;uade them to alter their Government into any other Species, this will be le&s;s worthy of blame, then craftily, or unfairly to force it out of their hands.</P>
<P N="2">2. It's granted, that according to the Light of Nature, there be various regular Models of Go|vernment;
<PB N="69" REF="001941_0068_0FBA20C5AC55F5D8">
but if Divine Wi&s;dom is plea&s;ed to interpo&s;e and over-rule Natures agitations, and ca&s;t the Scales for this or that particular Form, Nature will be but fair mannered to &s;ubmit to its Author and Rector. So that if we find that God has Di&s;clo&s;ed his Mind by Revelation, that his Churches be the Subjects of a Democracy, then all &s;tand obliged to comply under a double Bond. And &s;o we come under a proper Cri&s;is to enquire in the next place for Scripture-evi|dence in the Ju&s;tification of the&s;e Churches.</P>
<P>But before I proceed to it, I &s;hall</P>
<P N="3">3. Make &s;ome brief Improvement of the main <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> in the Demon&s;tration; that is to &s;ay, If the Government of the Go&s;pel Churches, be a Democracy, the&s;e Con&s;equen|ces mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, <HI>&s;cil.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Con&s;.</HI> That the Right of Convoking Coun|cils Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, is in the Churches.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Con&s;.</HI> That &s;uch a Council has only Con|&s;ultative, not a Juridical Power in it. A Juri|dical Power committed to &s;uch a Repre&s;enta|tive Body is both needle&s;s, and al&s;o dangerous to the di&s;tinct and perfect States they derive from. Compleat States &s;ettled upon a Body of immutable and imperial Laws as its Ba&s;is, may want Council; but to Create a new Subject of Juridical Power, is &s;ome way to indanger the Being of the Creators.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Con&s;</HI> That all the Members of an Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Council, deriving from a Democracy are Subjects of equal Power. Whatever the Power is, the &s;everal Delegates mu&s;t from the nature of the Government they derive from, be equal &s;harers in it. Democratical States, in their Repre&s;entative Body can make but one Hou&s;e,
<PB N="70" REF="001941_0069_0FBA20C6CCEE2A58">
becau&s;e they have but one Subject of Supream Power in their Nature, and therefore their De|legates, let them be who or what they may be, are under equal Tru&s;t; &s;o that none can ju&s;tly claim Superiority over their Fellows, or pre|tend to a higher power in their Suffrage. In|deed, in &s;uch Kingdoms, where the Sovereign Power is di&s;tributed and &s;ettled in divers Sub|jects, that the ballance of Power may be more Even, for the &s;afety of the whole, and of all parts under all Acts of Sovereign Power: From &s;uch a Settlement of Power, there ari&s;es &s;everal di&s;tinct States in the &s;ame Government, which when Convened as one Subject of Sove|reign Power, they make different Hou&s;es in their Grand Se&s;&s;ions; and &s;o one Hou&s;e or State can Negative another. But in every di&s;tinct Hou&s;e of the&s;e States, the Members are equal in their Vote, the mo&s;t Ayes makes the Affirma|tive Vote, and mo&s;t No's the Negative: They don't weigh the intellectual furniture, or other di&s;tingui&s;hing Qualifications of the &s;everal Vo|ters in the Scales of the Golden Rule of Fel|low&s;hip; they only add up the Aves, and the No's, and &s;o determine the Suffrage of the Hou&s;e.</P>

<P>THis Plea has with &s;uch variety of Ar|gument, and Illu&s;tration, and by many Repetitions, been pur&s;ued, by a great Number of Per&s;ons eminent for Learning and Piety, that I might here very fairly relea&s;e my &s;elf from this task. But yet to compleat the
<PB N="71" REF="001941_0070_0FBA20C8431F9F20">
Number of my Arguments, I will briefly &s;um up the Demon&s;tration for the Readers u&s;e under a few heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. Head. It mu&s;t needs be allowed, as a fundamental Principle relating to Govern|ment, that [under God] all Power is Ori|ginally in the People. No Man I think will deny it to be a very &s;ound Principle in Civil Knowledge. But if any Man will, I imagine it is &s;ufficiently &s;et forth in the former De|mon&s;tration. And it is very plain that Reli|gion does always Cultivate, and Increa&s;e ra|ther then Dimini&s;h any of Natures ju&s;t Pre|rogatives. That it mu&s;t needs &s;tand for a Paradox, or a Riddle not to be Expounded; if Man is more of a Slave by his Religion then by his Nature. But let us take a brief view of Man by Scripture Account under a Religious Notion, as the Subject of Grace, and he &s;eems then not to have the lea&s;t &s;peck of Va&s;&s;alage in him; but is repre&s;ented as though Lord of him&s;elf and owner of Hea|ven and Earth both, 1 Cor. 3.22. &mdash; <HI>all are yours.</HI></P>
<P>And though its very certain that Man has greatly deba&s;ed him&s;elf by his Apo&s;tacy; yet &s;till God puts abundance of Honour up|on him in his Reduction. As we may con|&s;ider Man in a remark or two, under the mea&s;ures of Divine Grace in re&s;toring him <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> favour. Fir&s;t, God treats him as a Crea|ture of a very Honourable Character, as tree
<PB N="72" REF="001941_0071_0FBA20CC89BEB488">
and at his own di&s;po&s;e. Or as though he were &s;ome high and mighty State placed at the Top of this Glob: Therefore he Courts him into an Alliance as though he were likely to yield great Honour to the Crown. <HI>We are Amba&s;&s;adors &mdash; as though God did be|&s;eech you by us; we pray you in Christs &s;tead &mdash; be reconciled to God,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.20. This is much the Tenour of Gods Heralds in their Addre&s;&s;es of Capitulation. That certainly if God did not highly e&s;timate Man, as a Creature Exalted, by his Rea&s;on, Liberty and Noblene&s;s of Nature, he would not care&s;s him as he does in order to his Sub|mi&s;&s;ion; but rather with &s;ome peevi&s;h and haughty Monarch, or the Bloody <HI>Mahomet,</HI> &s;end his demands at the Mouth of his Can|non. But in&s;tead of &s;uch har&s;h mea&s;ures, they are treated with the highe&s;t Rea&s;on, attended with Lenity and great Acts of Con|de&s;cention. Nay, Divine Menaces are fre|quently cloathed with &s;uch &s;oft Language as this; <HI>Turn ye! Turn ye! Why will ye Dy?</HI> Yea under all impul&s;ive means, which God Wi&s;e|ly and Graciou&s;ly makes u&s;e of to gain Mans con&s;ent, he &s;ets the Will to turn about it &s;elf without forcing it, that &s;o mans Religion may be the free and candid Emanations of his Noble and Exalted Nature. But when God has thus gained Man; may we rationally imagine that in Erecting his Trophies he will a&s;&s;ign and make him over to &s;ome Petty and
<PB N="73" REF="001941_0072_0FBA20CF05830A90">
Arbitrary Potentates in matters of Religion? or &s;ettle him under a Di&s;potick Government as tho' he was the &s;poils of a &s;piteful War? No certainly, but Man mu&s;t now be con|&s;idered as &s;ome high Allie inve&s;ted with more Power then ever. This would &s;till be more evident if we &s;hould con&s;ider what Chri&s;t has done and how they &s;tand Joynt Heirs with him in his Purcha&s;e and Kingdom, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1, 16, 17.</P>
<P N="2">2. Head. The Power placed in Man that enables him to manage Religious affairs, is not Sovereign, but limited and confined Power. (1.) All Laws are Enacted already, and, (2.) There is no Coercive Power needful in the Church. The highe&s;t Act in Admini&s;tring Judicature, is Excluding a Per|&s;on out of the Society. In the Church there is no fees or fines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In Civil Empire to keep Mankind in any good <HI>Daecorum,</HI> there's much hard work to be done, in Peace and War; under mein Proce&s;s, and in Criminal Cau&s;es. There's forming of Armies, rai&s;ing the <HI>po&s;&s;e Comitatus,</HI> building of Ca&s;tles <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Cropping of Ears, Chopping off of heads and what not! So that Civil Government has need of an Immen&s;e Power as well as Trea|&s;ure, and to be cloathed with Bra&s;s, and I|ron. But as for the Church of God, Faith, Prayers &amp; Tears, are generally their be&s;t Wea|pons again&s;t the Ho&s;tility of Foreigners; &amp; in the Government of their home-born, it may

be done by &s;oft words, or hard words, 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 5. 12. <HI>Heb.</HI> 3.13.&mdash; 10.24.25. So that the bu&s;ine&s;s does not require abundance of External force, or form of Government. That it's a Thou|&s;and pitties to make &s;uch a great noi&s;e and bu&s;tle in the World about Church Power, as tho' the Subjects of it were to furni&s;h Armies and Navies to encounter half the Potentates on Earth in defence of the Church. When alas good men! As to all Occa&s;ion for Power its quite another thing; and the Exerci&s;e of it generally falls within reach of an ordinary Rea&s;on. That certainly whatever the Right of the Brotherhood is as to the Original of Power; there cannot be abundance of bad Omens in allowing them &s;ome &s;hare in Church Judicatory.</P>
<P N="3">3. Head. Power &mdash; this Word &s;eems to be all thunder. But however; it is very Copious and may be applyed to God and his Creatures. It is predicable of the latter, in their differing Cla&s;&s;es and Orders of Being, and none &s;o weak but have &s;ome &s;hare of it. But to confine the Word to Polity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is by &s;ome thus defined. <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Power or Authority &mdash; Is that whereby a Man may claim, or challenge any thing to ones &s;elf, without the Injury of another, upon a &s;uppo&s;ition: This is a true definition.</P>

<P>Power is an Ability, furni&s;hed with a Lawful Right to Act.

Church thus con&s;idered cannot formally Ex|erci&s;e all Branches of Power belonging to it: Neither can the Subject of Sovereign Power it &s;elf exert all Acts of Power till fitted with proper Organs or a &s;uitable Mini&s;try, and yet it can't be denied but that all Power really, and all Acts of Power Virtually, mu&s;t needs be in it.

<P>Therefore as to Church Power in the Ex|erci&s;e of it; it may be di&s;tributed into what belongs (1.) To the Combination of many, <HI>viz.</HI> The Power of Judgment and Donation. Or, (2.)

<P N="1">1. There is a Preparatory Power in them both as Rational and Sanctified Beings of forming them&s;elves into Churches.

He that hath read the Go&s;pel, and ob|&s;erved how many Churches are mentioned, without Notice taken, of the manner of their Origination, mu&s;t needs allow the ob&s;erva|tion to be a fair Con&s;equence from it.

<P N="1">1. Power. The Election of Officers. Offi|cers are for the well-being, and compleating of any State. There is no Regular Govern|ment can well &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them; the&s;e are the Hands, the Eyes, the Ears and Feet of Government in Admini&s;tration. To &s;eparate Qualifyed Per&s;ons to the highe&s;t Office Tru&s;t in a State, is by Civilians attributed to the Creating Power of Sovereignty. So that it mu&s;t needs be a great Power belonging to the Church under this head, and that it is the Churches Prerogative I might Rea&s;on; <HI>Ex Jure Superioritatis.</HI> For that the Church is Superiour to its Officers; and not the Of|ficers to the Church. For that Churches are not made for Officers, but Officers for Churches; therefore &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, 1 Cor. 3.22. <HI>All things are yours &mdash; whether Paul, or Apollos or Cephas.</HI> But I &s;hall principally depend upon the Example and Practice of the Apo&s;tolical Church under this head. It is a Celebrated &s;aying of <HI>Cyprian</HI> in pre&s;&s;ing, <HI>Acts</HI> 1.26.

That unle&s;s any one can fairly make it out that the Apo&s;tles were either in Je&s;t, or did they know not what, in directing the Bre|thren, to do as they did in the Recited Exam|ples; it mu&s;t needs &s;tand for a Truth, that the Power of Electing Officers is in the Fra|ternity of the Church, by the Judgment of Chri&s;t's Apo&s;tles.</P>

And how comes one man to have power over another, unle&s;s Conque&s;t, Ho&s;tility, or Compacts have made them liable, as Members of the &s;ame Community, or Subjects of the &s;ame Government? Therefore the offended Per&s;on, proceeding regularly for detecting a Delinquent, mu&s;t needs be &s;uppo&s;ed to derive his power from the &s;ame fountain, <HI>viz.</HI> the Se&s;&s;ions where the Ca&s;e is finally to i&s;&s;ue by Execution.

<P>But moreover, let it be con&s;idered, That to &s;peak by way of allu&s;ion, there be &s;everal Re|moves of the Action of Tre&s;pa&s;s, from one hear|ing to another; as tho' it go from an Inferiour to a Superiour Se&s;&s;ions, and that Chri&s;t was here in this Precept, &s;ettling Inferiour and Su|periour A&s;&s;izes in his Kingdom. And indeed there cannot be a wi&s;er Scheme drawn up, that &s;hall carry the a&s;pect of more Grace, Love, Hu|mility, tender regard to Honour, and al&s;o Ju&s;|tice then this; both for the encouragement of Religion, the awing of Spectators, and keeping the Church pure.

Plaintiff has a right to enter his Ca&s;e at this Se&s;|&s;ions, and here we &s;ee it may be i&s;&s;ued; then certainly this is a Branch of the Power of Judi|cature; otherwi&s;e an agrieved per&s;on might ex|pect a very &s;evere Repul&s;e from a &s;turdier Of|fender, for interrupting a mans repo&s;e of mind in his own actions.

So that the complaining Party may Commence his Suit with boldne&s;s, produce his Pleas, and demand Ju&s;tice. But the critical Que&s;tion is, <HI>Who is Judge of this Court?</HI> Certainly it is &s;ome Lay-mans Powers, &s;uppo&s;ed to be very competent Judges, as &s;uffi|ciently skilled in the Rules of Court, and how to apply them. And why may not all the Judg|es contained in the whole Series of Judicatory laid open in this Text, be of the &s;ame &s;ort? for that the Ca&s;e is not &s;o deep, but that the fir&s;t Judges &amp; Se&s;&s;ions it comes before, are &s;uppo&s;ed by our wi&s;e Saviour &amp; Law-giver, capable fully to under&s;tand and traver&s;e it; and do Judgment and Ju&s;tice upon it; and bring it to a final I&s;|&s;ue.

I have &s;ufficiently, I think, evinced the Power in the Brotherhood; and though every Church is a Body con&s;i&s;ting of very numerous Parts and a noble Mini&s;try, yet the ballance of Power is very exactly and with great advantage pre&s;erved; both between the Members of the Body in general, and be|tween them&s;elves, and their Publick Mini&s;try in &s;pecial.</P>
<P N="1">1. Between the Members of the Body. For be&s;ides, the Wi&s;dom, Love and other eno|bling Principles, in &s;ome mea&s;ure actuating every member. The Venerable Major Vote, which Guides and Governs the Augu&s;t States of Parliaments; nay all A&s;&s;embly's, Superiour

<P N="2">2.

<P N="1">1. The great Veneration in Mans mind to|wards tho&s;e who are &s;en&s;ibly cloathed with Authority. <HI>If I am a Father where is my Ho|nour, if a Ma&s;ter where is my Fear,</HI> Mat. 1.6.

The Prophet Rea&s;ons from the Law of Na|ture; there being &s;uch a property planted in the Soul by its Maker to revere Superiours, and e&s;pecially Men in publick tru&s;t. And al&s;o the Authority &s;hining in them, being &s;uch bright Rays both of the Divine Maje&s;ty and Benignity, there being &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible Good and Benefit accruing thereby, to the re&s;t of Mankind, hence &s;prings a univer&s;al di&s;po&s;ition to Obedience and Submi&s;&s;ion, this is obvious through the whole Civil Mini&s;try of the World; there is no need to make e|very Judge in Commi&s;&s;ion, or chief Magi&s;trate a Sovereign Prince to gain Homage to him. No! but as &s;oon as a Man appears ve&s;ted with Authority, there is that in the Soul of another which teaches Reverence and Obe|dience to him in his Tru&s;t, both from the Sugge&s;tions of fear and &s;ence of Intere&s;t. So that a Learned, Painful and Pious Mini&s;try Intru&s;ted with the Souls &amp; happine&s;s of Men; and taking Indefatigable care to &s;ecure Eter|nal Life for them, has a mo&s;t charming and endearing A&s;pect and Influence upon all the Rational Powers.

<P N="2">2. From the Extent of Commi&s;&s;ion, with the many enobling Prerogatives fixed in their Tru&s;t. Though they are the Mini&s;try, and but the Mini&s;try of a Democracy, their Com|mi&s;&s;ion is &s;o Large, and High-Prerogatives &s;o numerous, they carry &s;o great an appearance, as though in reality they were the Subjects of all Power. And I think it is &s;o from the Nature and Modes of all Regular Govern|ment; for when a Government has Enacted their Laws and Precepts, and &s;etled their Mi|ni&s;try, they leave the &s;way of things to them; that it is as though they had Re&s;igned all the Power to their Mini&s;try: So it is peculiarly in the affairs of Go&s;pel Churches.

<P>From the near Affinity our Con&s;titution holds with the Civil Governments of &s;ome of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Common-wealths in the World. It's certain, every Species of Govern|ment &s;imple and mixt, have their various Ex|cellencies and Defects; much may be &s;aid in honour of each, and al&s;o every Con&s;titution may have &s;omething wanting; at lea&s;t it may &s;eem &s;o, under a more critical &s;urvey of its Nature, Principles, Ill-conveniencies, corrupt Mini&s;try, Misfortunes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And many times a Government falls under Scandal from Di&s;tem|per of Mind, from fal&s;e Ends and corrupt In|tere&s;ts, which &s;way and over-rule mens tho'ts relating to Government, more than from the Con&s;titution it &s;elf. But however, to Evade all circular Di&s;cour&s;es, we may very fairly Infer, where we find Nations flouri&s;hing, and their Li|berty and Property, with the re&s;t of the great Immunities of Man's Nature nouri&s;hed, &s;ecured, and be&s;t guarded from Tyranny, we may venture to pronounce this People to be the Subjects of a noble Government, and there be many &s;uch on Earth, who&s;e Con&s;titution will &s;erve to ju&s;tifie ours. I &s;hall in&s;tance in three, and no more.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Venetian</HI> Common-wealth; tho' &s;ome are plea&s;ed to call the Government of this free State, an Ari&s;tocracy; but it &s;eems more pro|perly a limited Democracy; for that the Seat
<PB N="94" REF="001941_0093_0FBA20FE6DA9A2E0">
of Sovereign Power is their ancient Commons, called their Families, Enrolled in the Golden Book; the&s;e make up the grand Council of the Nation, &s;ettle the Publick Mini&s;try, and Enact Laws, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This People have by this mode of Government rai&s;ed them&s;elves into &s;o augu&s;t and flouri&s;hing a Capacity, that from a very ob&s;cure Original, they are grown to that degree, as to bridle and curb the pride and haughtine&s;s of <HI>Turk</HI> and <HI>Pope</HI> This Example mu&s;t needs be no &s;mall Honour to our Con&s;titution. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Belgick</HI> Provinces are without Inter|ruption allowed to be the Subjects of a formed Democracy, They in &s;ome Ages pa&s;t being in|&s;ulted, and unmercifully trampled upon by that augu&s;t Tyrant, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarch; they be|ing his Subjects broke loo&s;e from him, and &s;et up for them&s;elves. They a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves their Original Power, and when they had got it into their hands, had the wit, and kept it, &amp; have improved it in the form of a Democracy to this day, and God has ble&s;t them: That from the poor States of <HI>Holland,</HI> they are now grown to wear the &s;plendid Title of <HI>Their High Migh|tine&s;&s;es,</HI> and are a Match for mo&s;t Monarchs on Earth. Says <HI>Gordon</HI> of their Government: <HI>The &s;even Provinces of</HI> Holland <HI>being under a Democratical Government, are as it were &s;everal Common wealths; each Province being a di&s;tinct State; yea, and every City having an Independent Power within it &s;elf to Judge of all Cau&s;es, whe|ther Civil or Criminal, and to inflict even Capital Puni&s;hments; but all joyning together, make one Republick, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in the World.</HI></P>
<P>Query. <HI>Whether &s;uch Examples of Popular Go|vernments now Extant on Earth, and yielding &s;uch
<PB N="95" REF="001941_0094_0FBA20FFC9E0A7F0">
va&s;t advantages to the Subjects, and being &s;o regu|lar and practicable; I &s;ay, whether they may not ju&s;tly deter all men from reproaching our Con&s;titu|tion with the &s;candalous Title of Anarchy, unle&s;s they will allow us to prepare a Chronicle for them, and therein publi&s;h to the World their profound Ig|norance of the &s;everal Species of Governments; &amp; the di&s;tinct way of Placing and Exerci&s;ing various Powers in them.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> This Nation is reputed to be the Subjects of the fine&s;t and mo&s;t incompa|rable Government in the World. And this O+riginal happy Form of Government, is [&s;ays one] <HI>Truly and properly called an</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Mans Liberty: A priviledge to be freed in Per&s;on and E&s;tate from Arbitrary Violence and Oppre&s;&s;ion&punc; and a greater Inheritance than we derive from our Parents.</HI> And this Birth right of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men &s;hines mo&s;t con&s;picuou&s;ly in two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. In <HI>Parliaments</HI>; wherein the Subject has by his Repre&s;entatives, a &s;hare in Legi&s;lative Power: And &s;o makes his own Laws, and di&s;|po&s;es of his own Money.</P>
<P N="2">2. In <HI>Jury's</HI>; whereby he has a &s;hare in the Executive part of Law, &s;o that no Cau&s;es are Tryed, nor any man Adjudged to lo&s;e his Life, Member or E&s;tate, but upon the Verdict of his Peers; his Equal or Neighbours, and of his own Condition. The&s;e two grand Pillars of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty, are the fundamental vital Priviledges whereby we have been, and are &s;till pre&s;erved more free and happy, than any other People in the World; and we tru&s;t &s;hall ever continue &s;o. For who&s;oever &s;hall de&s;ign to impair, per|vert, or undermine either of the&s;e, do &s;trike at the very Con&s;titution of our Government, and
<PB N="96" REF="001941_0095_0FBA21055B81E690">
ought to be pro&s;ecuted and puni&s;hed, with the utmo&s;t zeal and vigour. For to poy&s;on all the Springs and Rivers in the Kingdom, could not be a greater mi&s;chief; for this would only af|fect the pre&s;ent Age, but the other would Ru|ine and In&s;lave all our Po&s;terity. I &s;hall im|prove this Example by three Quaeries.</P>
<P><HI>Quaery</HI> 1. Ah! What's the matter with <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Men, Men of &s;uch Courage to be &s;urprized with &s;uch fear, as tho' they were like to be ta|ken Captive, and turned into Slaves in their own Home? Why, in good truth, there may be a Rea&s;on for it; therefore it becomes them to be very careful under this head; for if they make them&s;elves Slaves in their own Country, or let others do it for them, when they can prevent it, they both deny God who Made and Redeemed them, and plainly Violate the Law of Nature?</P>
<P><HI>Quaery</HI> 2. Who is it <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men are thus a|fraid of? Who do they thus Reflect upon in their frights and fears? It is neither <HI>France</HI> nor the <HI>Great Turk</HI> which dreads them! therefore it mu&s;t needs be &s;ome body or another nearer home that threatens their Liberty. And may not <HI>New-England</HI>'s Go&s;pel Liberties de&s;erve &s;o much fear and caution, although it &s;hould &s;o happen that &s;ome body &s;hould be Reflected up|on by their Cautiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Quaery</HI> 3. If the &s;ettling &s;uch Immunities, as the priviledge of Parliaments and Juries in the hands of the People be &s;uch effectual Barriers to pre&s;erve a Nation from Tyranny and Slavery; then whether when Go&s;pel Churches have the Means in their own Power, it been't their wi&s;|dom to keep up the like Barrier, or &s;omething
<PB N="97" REF="001941_0096_0FBA210798529000">
equivalent thereto; that they may pre&s;erve them&s;elves &s;afe from the Arbitrary Mea&s;ures of their own Mini&s;try? or thus, Whether for <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Men, when their Liberties in Church or State are fa&s;t lockt up for them and their Po&s;te|rity by Law and regular Settlements, it been't their be&s;t way to beware how they Repeal tho&s;e Laws, or weaken tho&s;e Settlements?</P>
<P>But at pre&s;ent I &s;hall leave it to other men to run the Parallel between our Con&s;titution, and the &s;everal Governments I have mentioned, and infer what more they &s;hall think proper; only leaving to my &s;elf the liberty to conclude, that the &s;everal Examples of Civil States, which I have named, do &s;erve abundantly to ju&s;tifie the noble Nature of our Con&s;titution in Church-Order; for that the &s;everal famous &amp; augu&s;t Nations which I have mentioned, in all their Glory at Home, &amp; Succe&s;s in Arms &amp; Trade A|broad; their &s;everal Governments which have brought them to all this, are either a perfect Democracy, or very much mixed and blendi&s;hed with it.</P>
<P>Then why &s;hould we in <HI>New-England</HI> be any more a&s;hamed, or le&s;s careful of our Church-Government, which keeps us from Tyranny and Slavery in the concerns of our Con&s;ciences, then tho&s;e Nations are of their Civil Government, whereby they are pre&s;er|ved from the like damnable Circum&s;tances in the Concerns of their outward Life, and Na|tural Rights and Fortunes?</P>

in the Fir&s;t Ages of the Chri&s;tian Churches, and in the la&s;t Century.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the fir&s;t Ages of the Chri&s;tian Churches God has put many Marks of di&s;tingui&s;hing Fa|vour upon this Con&s;titution, both in the &s;miles and frowns of his Providence.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the &s;miles of Providence upon the Chur|ches whil&s;t they continued compleat in their Con&s;titution. I &s;hall offer but three Particu|lars, to ju&s;tifie this <HI>Ob&s;ervation.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. In the great and admirable Succe&s;s of the Go&s;pel, in the <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> of &s;o many Nations.</P>
<P N="2">2. In their &s;ingular Purity, and <HI>Vertuous De|portment</HI> in the mid&s;t of a corrupt World. That [as Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> ob&s;erves] <HI>was a general Eulogy belonging to their Members, and a&s;cribed to them by the wi&s;er &s;ort of Heathen,</HI> &s;cil. <HI>Bonus vir, tan|tum Chri&s;tianus,</HI> He is a Good Man only is a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="3">3. They were eminently &s;upported &amp; carried on by the Grace &amp; Providence of God thro' all their direful Sufferings; the more they were wa&s;ted and de&s;troyed, the more they grew and increa&s;ed, as <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in <HI>Egypt</HI> Indeed whil&s;t they remained firm to their Con&s;titution, they were not only like an Army in Banners, but in reality the greate&s;t Conquerours that ever ap|peared on Earth. They meerly baffled the bra|very of the old <HI>Roman</HI> Spirit, and were quite too hard for tho&s;e who had vanqui&s;hed the World. I have &s;een, &s;aith <HI>Eu&s;ebius, the Execu|tioner</HI> [tyred with tormenting them] <HI>lie down panting and breathing,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But I never &s;aw the Martyrs weary of Sufferings, nor heard them de|&s;ire a Truce: Nay, were rather ambitious of the longe&s;t and mo&s;t terrible Sufferings, that they might

be Martyrs in every Member.</HI> Thus the Chur|ches endured hardne&s;s as good Souldiers of Chri&s;t, thro' ten bloody Per&s;ecutions; and at la&s;t Retreated by Divine Providence, under the Umbrage of the Great <HI>Con&s;tantine.</HI> And there the Churches of God made the fine&s;t &s;how that ever was &s;een on Earth, next to Chri&s;t in his Transfiguration. Till this time the Churches remained the Subjects of their Democratical Government in &s;ome good mea&s;ure tho' there were &s;ome &s;ymptoms of an alteration in the la&s;t Century, but indeed after the Churches were freed from the rage of Heathen Per&s;ecutors, there quickly followed the perfect &s;ubver&s;ion of their Order. So we come,</P>
<P N="2">2. To Con&s;ider the frowns of Providence that pur&s;ued the Chri&s;tian World after the Sub|ver&s;ion of their Primitive Con&s;titution. Suffi|cient ob&s;ervations have been made under the foregoing Demon&s;trations, &s;etting forth the Change of Government which was made in the Churches. And in &s;hort, it was really and pro|perly the altering the Mini&s;try of a Democracy into an Ari&s;tocracy; for to &s;peak plainly, the Publick Officers to gratifie their ambition, took all the Power into their own hands, and &s;ettled all Affairs and Concerns according to their own minds without controul. But let us Eye the Providence of God, and we may ob&s;erve that God did &s;oon &s;tain the pride and glory of the&s;e men; e&s;pecially in two eminent In&s;tances of his Di&s;plea&s;ure, which I &s;hall only mention.</P>
<P><HI>In&s;tance</HI> 1. In the fatal <HI>Arian</HI> Haere&s;y, that &s;pread it &s;elf like &s;ome mortal Contagion, thro' the Chri&s;tian World; that it was &s;aid the whole World was become an <HI>Arian. Arius,</HI> was the

Author of this Damnable Doctrine, <HI>viz.</HI> That our Saviour Chri&s;t was neither God, nor Eter|nal, but a Creature; and that he a&s;&s;umed only the Body, not the Soul of Man, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Dam|nable Haere&s;y &s;oon &s;pread it &s;elf far and wide; the Author was in the heighth of his wicked|ne&s;s, and fell a Victim to Divine Vengeance in the latter part of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI>'s Reign: But his Haere&s;y continued and prevailed, and e&s;pecially among&s;t the Clergy. But this is very awful to ob&s;erve, That when the&s;e men by their wit and cunning had once cou&s;ened and cheated the Fra|ternity of their ancient Rights and Prerogatives, and left the Devil to cheat and deceive them, as Wi&s;e and Learned as they were, of their true Religion and Souls together. What good did all their Legerdemane do them now? had not they better have kept holy and humble Pa&s;tors, confined to their Parochial Dioce&s;&s;es, and known and Loved and Preach't Chri&s;t the Eter|nal Son of God, and him Crucified, rather then &s;tretcht their Boundary like Sovereign Princes, and &s;o left to peri&s;h under &s;uch a dreadful Di&s;|pen&s;ation, as the fruit of their Ambition and Infidelity?</P>
<P>To me [con&s;idering the Commencement, the deadly Nature, the Rage, the univer&s;al Prevalence and Continuance of this damnable Here&s;y] it &s;eems as though God had lookt down from Heaven, and viewed the Sacri|legious Robbery committed upon the Churches with Dete&s;tation.

It mu&s;t not, indeed, be thought, or &s;aid, but that God had a Remnant through many Ages, who continued Orthodox in Faith, both in the Mini&s;try and Brotherhood. But yet it is very obvious that Chri&s;tianity <HI>Grada<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">im,</HI> de|clined till all was &s;wallowed up in a Univer|&s;al and Direful Apo&s;tacy, never &s;ufficiently to be deplored; neither fully Expre&s;t, unle&s;s we Tran&s;cribe the Volumns that contain it.

For that the Con&s;titution fore|named was adju&s;ted by Divine Wi&s;dom for preventing and remedying &s;uch Maladies as

<P N="2">2. In the la&s;t Century God has been very Admirable in the works of Providence, and has therein highly Dignifyed our Con&s;titution. And we want no other evidence under this head then the Recognition of what God has done for the&s;e famous <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonys in North-<HI>America</HI>; who have all along di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves, from all the World, by their &s;ingular regard both to the Faith and Practice of the true Religion. Now let any other Con&s;titution on Earth but Parallel ours; in the eminent &s;hines of Providence and in Religious Effects, and we will re&s;ign the whole Cau&s;e. But whil&s;t then, we will go on, and rejoyce in the Grace of God, that we in the&s;e Countrys, are by his good Providence over us, the Subjects of the mo&s;t Ancient, Rati|onal and Noble Con&s;titution in Church Order that ever was, will be, or can be; whil&s;t the Laws of Nature and Grace remain unrepeal|led. For that it is a Con&s;titution which In|finite Wi&s;dom hath Authorized and founded in the Law of Nature; and his Omni&s;cient Providence has eminently Honoured, and Dig|nifyed, both by the Smiles and Frowns of his Countenance, through all the Ages of the Chri&s;tian World to this very Morning.

though &s;ome of the Reverend Churches with|in this grand Con&s;ociation [who &s;ettled upon the &s;ame Platform with us] have with too great a Precipitation made a Defection from the Con&s;titution: Yet this is our Comfort, that their alteration is not &s;o firm, as the Laws of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians</HI>; for that tho&s;e who turn'd them off, may by the &s;ame Power bring them on to their old Ba&s;is a|gain.

<HEAD>The Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>I &s;hall now Conclude my whole E&s;&s;ay, by annexing the Joynt Te&s;timony of tho&s;e emi|nent Men, Fathers in the&s;e Churches, now in Glory. <HI>viz.</HI> The Reverend Mr. <HI>John Hig|gin&s;on,</HI> and the Reverend Mr. <HI>William Hubbard.</HI> And the rather becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Hubbard</HI> did &s;ome time before his Death, de&s;ire to have their Te&s;timony Re-printed, and Live with &s;ome other Book which it might properly accom|pany. I am well &s;atisfyed the foregoing Subject is the mo&s;t proper Companion, their Te&s;timony could have Light on, in its Travels through the World: I therefore make bold to invite the &s;aid Te&s;timony, to &s;et out a|gain with fre&s;h Courage, and improve its Ex|cellent Language, together with former ac|ceptance it found with the Churches, to in|graciate

and be&s;peak favour for this &s;mall Treati&s;e, its new Allie and Fellow-Traveller.</P>
<P>And let the Holy Churches [for whom the&s;e now appear in Joynt Te&s;timony, to confirm their Divine Pedigree] flouri&s;h in their Strength, Beauty and Order, after this Triumvirate &s;hall &s;ink under the Tyranny of Moths, and Humane forgetfulne&s;s, and lye down in the Hou&s;e of oblivion; where I hope the Enemies of the Con&s;titution will be gotten down before them, and there fa&s;t Buried in their own Bones and Du&s;t.</P>
<P>But lea&s;t any &s;hould think it ab&s;urd, that I here produce &s;uch Venerable Authority in way of Epilogue, which &s;hould rather in Honour have been placed in the front of this attempt. To this I reply, that in Honour and Prudence I chu&s;e here to place the&s;e Worthies. For you mu&s;t note; I am now Retreating out of the field of Battle, and I hope upon Honourable terms too; and then the Reer is the highe&s;t place in dignity; &s;o that though they are bringers-up, its no diminution to them. And not only &s;o, but out of Prudent Conduct; for though I pre&s;ume the Enemy is fairly Van|qui&s;hed, yet &s;ome forlorn party may rally, and to gratify their de&s;perate fortune may di&s;turb us, but I hope the&s;e valiant and wi&s;e.

<P N="1">1. ABove <HI>Seventy Years</HI> have pa&s;&s;ed away, &s;ince one of us, and above <HI>Sixty,</HI> &s;ince the other of us came into <HI>New-England,</HI> and <HI>having obtained Help from God, we continue to this Day.</HI></P>
<P>We are therefore capable to make &s;ome <HI>Com|pari&s;on,</HI> between the Condition of the Churches, when they were fir&s;t <HI>Erected</HI> in this Countrey, and the Condition into which they are now <HI>Fallen,</HI> and more <HI>Falling</HI> every day.</P>
<P>But we wi&s;h, that in making this <HI>Compari&s;on,</HI> we had not cau&s;e to take the place, and the part of tho&s;e <HI>Old Men,</HI> that &s;aw the <HI>Young men &s;hout|ing aloud for Joy, at the New Temple,</HI> Ezra. 3.12. <HI>Ancient men that had &s;een the Fir&s;t Hou&s;e; when the Foundation of this Hou&s;e was laid before their Eyes, Wept with a loud Voice.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. We are under a daily Expectation of our call to appear before our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and we have rea&s;on to be above all things con|cerned, that we may <HI>give up our Account with Joy</HI> unto Him That we may be the better a|ble to do &s;o, we judge it nece&s;&s;ary for us, to

leave in the Hands of the Churches, a brief Te&s;timony, to <HI>the Cau&s;e of God, and His Peo|ple</HI> in this Land. And this the rather, be|cau&s;e we are &s;en&s;ible that there is Ri&s;en and Ri&s;ing among us, a Number who not only for&s;ake the <HI>Right wayes of the Lord,</HI> wherein the&s;e Holy Churches have walked, but al&s;o labour to carry away as many others with them as they can.</P>
<P>We are al&s;o informed, that many <HI>Younger men</HI> of great worth, and hearty Friends unto the <HI>Church-State</HI> of the Country, &s;carce know what Interpretation to put upon it; but find it a &s;en&s;ible Di&s;advantage unto them, that the <HI>Elder Men</HI> are &s;o &s;ilent, and remi&s;s upon the manife&s;t occa&s;ions, that call aloud for us to open our <HI>Mouth</HI> in the cau&s;e of Churches that we &s;hould be loth to &s;ee <HI>Led unto De&s;tructi|on.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. We that &s;aw the Per&s;ons, who from Four Famous Colonies, A&s;&s;embled in the <HI>Sy|nod,</HI> that agreed on our <HI>Platform of Church-Di&s;cipline,</HI> cannot forget their Excellent Cha|racter. They were Men of Great Renown in the Nation, from whence the <HI>Laudian Per|&s;ecution</HI> Exiled them; their Learning, their Holine&s;s, their Gravity, &s;truck all men that knew them with Admiration. They were <HI>Timothies</HI> in their Hou&s;es, <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tomes</HI> in their Pulpits, <HI>Augu&s;tines</HI> in their Di&s;putations. The <HI>Prayers,</HI> the <HI>Studies,</HI> the Humble <HI>Enquiries,</HI> with which they &s;ought after the mind of God, were as likely to pro&s;per as any mens upon Earth. And the <HI>Sufferings</HI> where in they were <HI>Confe&s;&s;ors</HI> for the Name and the Truth of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, add unto the Arguments

which would per&s;wade us, that our Gracious Lord would Reward and Honour them, with Communicating much of His Truth unto them.

<P>We do therefore in the fir&s;t place, Ear|ne&s;tly <HI>Te&s;tifie,</HI> That if any who are given to Change, do Ri&s;e up to Unhinge the <HI>well E&s;ta|bli&s;hed Churches</HI> in this Land, it will be the Duty and Intere&s;t of the Churches, to exa|mine, whether the <HI>men of this Tre&s;pa&s;s,</HI> are more <HI>Prayerful,</HI> more <HI>Watchful,</HI> more <HI>Zealous,</HI> more <HI>Patient,</HI> more <HI>Heavenly,</HI> more Univer|&s;ally <HI>Con&s;cient.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and Harder <HI>Students,</HI> and better <HI>Scholars,</HI> and more willing to be <HI>Informed</HI> and <HI>Advi&s;ed,</HI> than tho&s;e Great and Good men, who Left unto the Churches what they now enjoy: If they be <HI>not &s;o,</HI> it will be <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> for the Children to forbear <HI>pulling down with their own Hands,</HI> the <HI>Hou&s;es of God,</HI> which were Built by their <HI>Wi&s;er Fathers,</HI> until they have better &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>It is not yet forgot by &s;ome &s;urviving Ear|witne&s;&s;es of it, that when the <HI>Synod</HI> had fini&s;hed the <HI>Platform of Church-Di&s;cipline,</HI> they did with an Extraordinary Elevation of Soul and Voice, then Sing together, <HI>The Song of

<P N="4">4. It was a Joy unto us, to See and Read, a Book which the Reverend Prae&s;ident of our Colledge lately Publi&s;hed, under the Title of <HI>The Order of the Go&s;pel, Profe&s;&s;ed and Practi&s;ed by the Churches of Christ in New-England</HI>: A Book mo&s;t highly needful, and U&s;eful, and Sea&s;onable; a mo&s;t Elaborate and well-com|po&s;ed work, and well &s;uited unto tho&s;e two worthy de&s;igns; 1&s;t, the maintaining the <HI>Con|gregational-Church-Di&s;cipline</HI>; and 2dly, the maintaining the &s;weet Spirit of <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>Communion</HI> towards <HI>Reforming Presbyterians,</HI> who are our <HI>&V;nited Brethren.</HI> But we mu&s;t herewithal <HI>Te&s;tify,</HI> that in that worthy Book, there is <HI>nothing obtruded upon the Churches,</HI> but what they who were here, capable of ob&s;er|ving what was done <HI>Sixty</HI> Years ago, do know to have been <HI>Profe&s;&s;ed and Practi&s;ed in the Churches of New-England</HI>; (except in one or two) Then and ever &s;ince, until of late, &s;ome who were not then Born, have &s;ugge&s;ted o|therwi&s;e. Yea, 'tis well known, that the Churches then Publickly maintained tho&s;e Principles, in &s;everal Judicious Di&s;cour&s;es,
<PB N="5" REF="001941_0109_0FBA1F500C53D2A0">
which were never confuted by any men what|ever, unto this pre&s;ent time. And we do therefore mo&s;t Heartily commend that Book, of the <HI>Order of the Go&s;pel,</HI> unto the peru&s;al and acceptance of the Churches of the Lord.</P>
<P N="5">5. It was one of the <HI>Songs</HI> (as the Jewi&s;h Ma&s;ters tell us) in the Fea&s;t of Tabernacles, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be our Youth, which have not made our Old Men a&s;hamed.</HI> But alas, we that are <HI>Old men</HI> mu&s;t confe&s;s our &s;elves <HI>A&s;hamed,</HI> when we &s;ee after what manner &s;ome of our <HI>Youth,</HI> have expre&s;&s;ed and behaved them&s;elves, and with what <HI>Scoffs</HI> they have a&s;&s;aulted the <HI>Or|der of the Go&s;pel,</HI> in &s;ome things lately Pub|li&s;hed, and Scattered about the Country: Which have been &s;o far from An&s;wering the <HI>Arguments</HI> brought for our <HI>Church Order,</HI> That they have been by the wonderful Pro|vidence of Chri&s;t, made u&s;eful to E&s;tabli&s;h the minds of Serious Chri&s;tians, in tho&s;e very points, which they &s;ee &s;o weakly and &s;o rudely oppo&s;ed. We have taught our Children in the <HI>Catechi&s;m,</HI> called <HI>Milk for Babes,</HI> that there is to be a <HI>Covenant of God</HI> in the Chur|ches, wherein <HI>they give up them&s;elves, first unto the Lord to be his People, and then to the Elders and Brethren of the Churches to &s;et forward the Wor&s;hip of God, and mutual Edification.</HI> And it cannot but be grievous unto us, as well as unto all &s;erious Chri&s;tians, for my <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> Scornfully to vomit it up their <HI>Milk</HI> with <HI>Scoffs</HI> upon that and other
<PB N="6" REF="001941_0110_0FBA1F51A6ACFC58">
Sacred Actions in our Churches, <HI>too Horrible</HI> to be repeated.</P>
<P>If they take away from us, one of the <HI>Songs</HI> among the Ancient <HI>Jews,</HI> they would however leave us room for one of the <HI>Sighs</HI> ut|tered by a <HI>Rabby</HI> among them; <HI>The worst Fruit which we Eat in our Youth, Excelled the be&s;t which we now Eat in our Old Age, for in our days the World is changed.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Concerning all Sinful Attempts to over|turn the <HI>Order of the Go&s;pel,</HI> hitherto upheld in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> and to &s;poil that Glorious <HI>Work</HI> of God, which we have &s;een him doing, with a <HI>Series</HI> of <HI>Remarkable Providences,</HI> in erecting &s;uch <HI>Congregational</HI> Churches in the&s;e ends of the Earth; We would now therefore bear our <HI>Testimony,</HI> that they are doubtle&s;s Di&s;plea&s;ing to our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who <HI>walks in the midst of the&s;e Golden Candlesticks,</HI> and they will prove <HI>Bit|terne&s;s in the latter End.</HI></P>
<P>And this we Declare with the more concern upon our minds, becau&s;e of an ob&s;ervation, &s;o plain, that <HI>he that runs may Read it.</HI></P>
<P>It is too ob&s;ervable, that the <HI>Power of God|line&s;s,</HI> is exceedingly Decaying and Expiring in the Country; and one great point in the Decay of the <HI>Power of Godline&s;s,</HI> is mens growing weary of the <HI>Congregational Church-Di&s;cipline,</HI> which is evidently Calculated for to maintain it.</P>
<P>If that <HI>Church-Di&s;cipline</HI> were more tho|roughly
<PB N="7" REF="001941_0111_0FBA1F52F27436C8">
and vigorou&s;ly kept alive, even by tho&s;e that make profe&s;&s;ion of it, it might be hoped, that the Lord would Sanctify it, for the Revival of <HI>all Godline&s;s</HI> in the Land.</P>
<P>But if this <HI>Church-Di&s;cipline</HI> come to be given up, we think it our Duty, to leave this <HI>Warning</HI> with the Churches, that probably the <HI>Aposta&s;y</HI> will not <HI>Stop there:</HI> For the &s;ame Spirit that will di&s;po&s;e the next Ge|neration to <HI>change their</HI> way, in one point, will di&s;po&s;e them to more, and more <HI>changes</HI> (even in <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> as well as in <HI>Manners</HI>) until it may be feared, <HI>the Can|dle&s;tick will quickly be removed out of its place.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. We do therefore Humbly propo&s;e it, unto all the Churches, as a great <HI>Expedient,</HI> for the pre&s;ervation of our <HI>Church-State,</HI> that more <HI>Prayer</HI> (even in whole <HI>days of Prayer</HI> &s;et apart for that end) with other <HI>appointed means,</HI> may be u&s;ed in the Churches to ob|tain from the Lord, the <HI>Out-pourings of the Spirit of Grace on the Ri&s;ing Generation.</HI> If &s;o Rich a Ble&s;&s;ing were obtained, (and our <HI>Heavenly Father will give his Holy Spirit unto them that ask it,</HI>) and if the <HI>Ri&s;ing Generation</HI> might be a Praying, Pious, Devout and <HI>Re|generate Generation,</HI> there will not be &s;uch danger as now there is, of their <HI>Ea&s;ily giving away</HI> the precious <HI>Legacy</HI> which their Father's (now beholding the Face of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in Glory,) le&s;t unto them, or of their Doting upon <HI>Innovations</HI> Fatal to the <HI>Order of the Go&s;pel</HI> among us.</P>
