<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I &s;ent you my Remarks of the 23d of <HI>April,</HI> I have farther con&s;idered the pre&s;ent State of the Country, and had &s;ome new Tho'ts upon it. I was then of Opinion that Emitting more Province Bills, would but Encrea&s;e and Pro|long our Mi&s;eries, and therefore could not choo&s;e but be again&s;t it. And I am &s;ure &s;till that to Emit more ac|cording to any Publick or Private Scheme that hath been yet Projected, will do &s;o. I am &s;ure al&s;o that to leave off Tru&s;ting as far as it is practicable enough to do it, would in &s;ome time effectually &s;et all things to rights again. However I am &s;en&s;ible that in the mean time many People mu&s;t undergo con&s;iderable Straits and Difficulties. If therefore any way could be contrived to Emit more Province Bills without running into tho&s;e Fatal Inconve|niences which have attended former Projects of this Nature, or into others as bad, I &s;hould rejoyce in it as much as any Man in the Province. And upon &s;ome Application of Thought to this Matter, I hope I have hit upon a Project by which <HI>an Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds of Bills may be Emitted, in &s;uch a manner as to rai&s;e their Credit Equal to Silver, and to bring an Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds of Silver into the Country in a few Years.</HI> When I have had Opportunity to draw my Tho'ts upon this matter into Form, I intend to &s;ub|mit them to the Publick Cen&s;ure. In the mean time I have met with <HI>Some</HI> Remarks (of the 16th. of <HI>May</HI>) upon my Remarks: The&s;e I think it may not be ami&s;s to take &s;ome Notice of.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002190_0003_0FBCCC65A80B57C0">My Controver&s;y with Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> was not &s;o much whither <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in Fact labour'd under great Di&s;tre&s;&s;es; As whither he had not a&s;&s;igned wrong Cau&s;es of the&s;e Di&s;tre&s;&s;es? Becau&s;e a&s;&s;igning wrong Cau&s;es of Real Evils, is the way to lead into wrong Mea&s;ures to Remedy them.</P>
<P>Whither the Gentleman hath ju&s;tly repre&s;ented the Opinion of the Country; Or whither the People are of one mind where he hath Travel'd, and of another where I have Liv'd I &s;uppo&s;e time will di&s;cover.</P>
<P>He &s;ays I have done well to add the word SOME to my Remarks. I believe he &s;peaks as he thinks, for he hath imitated me in well doing in this matter. So hath he imitated the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> al&s;o which he &s;peaks of, by pa&s;&s;ing in &s;ilence tho&s;e things which I &s;uppo&s;e he found it hard to an&s;wer. But I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am a Man &s;o far &s;hort of a <HI>Common Under&s;tanding,</HI> that tho' I have carefully reviewed Mr. <HI>Colman's</HI> Pamphlet, I cannot find what <HI>tho&s;e Important Matters are, which are not toucht upon.</HI> I mu&s;t therefore borrow our Author's Expre&s;&s;ion in Page 11, <HI>I am &s;orry to find that he was for general Terms upon this head and did not care to de&s;cend to Particulars.</HI></P>
<P>I di&s;like the Per&s;onal Reflections in <HI>the Po&s;tcript</HI> as much as our Author does; but whither he might not have put in the Word <HI>SOME</HI> between <HI>Ju&s;tified by</HI> and <HI>Men of every Rank &amp; Order,</HI> as properly and with as much Truth as in his Title Page I leave to others to &s;ay.</P>
<P><HI>To An&s;wer the An&s;wers would take up too much time, &amp;c.</HI> If the Gentleman him&s;elf thinks his own Remarks to be no An&s;wers, I &s;uppo&s;e he will ea&s;ily get mo&s;t other Men to be of his mind. But then why he &s;hould trouble the World with his Remarks I can't well imagine.</P>
<P><HI>He &s;aith you have repre&s;ented Things in a &s;mart and moving manner, by which I perceive he thought the Town felt the truth of what you have written, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This al&s;o is beyond my Comprehen&s;ion! Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> writ &s;martly, therefore what he writ was true and felt
<PB N="5" REF="002190_0004_0FBCCC67A68FFE78">
by the Town. If there was danger of Mr. <HI>Colman's</HI> Rhe|torick, I think there is not much of this Gentlemans Logick. I &s;uppo&s;e he knows that &s;harp Writing &s;ome|times irritates Men's Pa&s;&s;ions, and creates Heats and Animo&s;ities where there is no ju&s;t cau&s;e for them.</P>
<P><HI>As to the ill u&s;es which have been made of our Pro|vince Bills, and the unhappy Con&s;equences re&s;ulting therefrom, I &s;hall not run into the Argument, it being nothing to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e.</HI> I think Sir nothing can be more to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, than to let the Country know truly how we came into &s;uch a Ca&s;e; for unle&s;s we know what bro't us into our pre&s;ent Difficul|ties, I am &s;ure we &s;hall not be like to &s;ee our way very clearly out again. But if the Gentleman thinks it a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for not <HI>running into an Argument,</HI> which perhaps it might not be very ea&s;y to clear him|&s;elf of again, to &s;ay that it is nothing to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; at that rate he might have &s;av'd him&s;elf from much trouble, and others from &s;ome expence, by only putting an Adverti&s;ement into the News-Letter and Ga|zett, That my Remarks <HI>were all nothing to the pre|&s;ent Ca&s;e</HI>&mdash;.</P>
<P><HI>The Province Bills received their deadly wound the Day they were fir&s;t invented, &amp;c.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e our Author him&s;elf remembers when for many Days the Merchants them&s;elves would upon &s;ome oc|ca&s;ions, give Silver for them without receiving any advance, and thank ye too. It was &s;ometime (tho' indeed not very long) before they &s;eem'd to under&s;tand the Advantage put into their hands to Export the Silver.</P>
<P>But how came the Province Bills to receive this <HI>dead|ly wound?</HI> Why, <HI>Becau&s;e they were not made a lawful Tender,</HI> Or becau&s;e there was not a Law made that they &s;hould An&s;wer Specialties. If &s;uch a Law had been made, it would not have &s;ignifyed much towards keep|ing up the Credit of them. Since the Importation of Foreign Commodities hath been greater than the Pro|duce of the Country would An&s;wer for, there hath been a nece&s;&s;ity that Silver &s;hould go to help make the
<PB N="6" REF="002190_0005_0FBCCC68A55AAAF8">
Ballance, and while there was a nece&s;&s;ity of this, Pro|vince Bills mu&s;t needs have been improved to Buy it up. And this would unavoidably have made a difference in a &s;hort time between Province Bills and Silver, notwith|&s;tanding any Act for making them a Lawful Tender. Now if &s;uch an Act could not have kept up the Credit of them, I am &s;ure it would &s;oon have been the occa|&s;ion of much Inju&s;tice and Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>What he alludes to about the <HI>Canada Expedition,</HI> I cannot tell. But I &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Poor Men</HI> &s;pent their Wages quickly after they got home, and the Gentleman knows that the Credit of our Bills was not <HI>then</HI> &s;unk near &s;o low, as it hath been &s;ince the Po&s;t-poning the Taxes and the Emi&s;&s;ion of Loan Money.</P>
<P>IT IS THE INTEREST OF THE MERCHANTS TO RUN DOWN THE VALUE OF THE PUBLICK BILLS, IN ORDER TO GET MONEY BY THEM. <HI>If this be the Ca&s;e,</HI> then as Things &s;tand at pre&s;ent, no|thing will cure this evil Practice but a Scarcity of the Bills. When once Merchants really find the want of them, they will &s;oon prize them high enough.</P>
<P><HI>The GREAT ARGUMENT with me for a Pri|vate Bank is, that it would be in the Hands of A MUL|TITUDE of Men, who&s;e Intere&s;t it would be to &s;upport the Credit of their Bills, &amp;c.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e the Province Bills are in the hands of at lea&s;t as great a Multitude. And I believe that every Man that owns a Province Bill wi&s;hes it were as good to him as Silver, and is ready to u&s;e any means which he thinks may conduce to make it &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Whereas it is and always will be the Intere&s;t of every Private Man to undervalue the Publick Bills&punc; by Selling his Silver to the highe&s;t Bidder, &amp;c.</HI> This again is quite out of my reach! One wou'd imagine by this, that every Private Man in the Country hath, and always will have Silver to Sell. If every Man Sells Silver, pray who are the Bidders for it, and who the highe&s;t Bidders? The Gentleman &s;ays afterwards, that <HI>perhaps I am a Sallary Man.</HI> I a&s;&s;ure him I am not;
<PB N="7" REF="002190_0006_0FBCCC6A26B5D9E0">
but I don't know but that &s;ome will &s;u&s;pect him, from this Pa&s;&s;age, to be a Seller of Silver.</P>
<P><HI>I am fully of the Gentlemans mind, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible either the Town or Country &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out &s;ome Medium or other.</HI> But <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Bank Bills ac|cording to any Scheme projected yet, will &s;erve the turn better than Province Bills, I am &s;ure his <HI>Great</HI> Argu|ment above don't prove.</P>
<P>What the Gentleman &s;aith about our Burthening Trade with heavy Duties, I won't my &s;elf call <HI>Eva&s;ion, Mi&s;repre&s;entation &amp; Amu&s;ement.</HI> Let the Reader call it what he thinks fit. I gave Two Rea&s;ons for the de|cline of the Trade of Bo&s;ton, that &s;o People might know that their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es were not owing wholly to the want of Medium. He pa&s;&s;es one in &s;ilence. <HI>As any wi&s;e Man would.</HI> The other he would fain &s;hift quite away to other Provinces, and lay blame on our own Govern|ment. He don't tell us concerning <HI>Newbury, Ip&s;wich, Cape-Ann, Marblehead, Salem,</HI> (not to mention other Places;) all within our own Province, that none of them carried on &s;o large a Foreign Trade during the late French War as they do now, and that &s;ome of them carried on no Foreign Trade at all: but he would make us believe that by heavy Duties we have driven away Trade to our Neighbours. What are the&s;e heavy Duties laid upon? I &s;uppo&s;e he won't &s;ay upon Engli&s;h Goods. Perhaps the Taverners and Retailers may re|member for him, that there is an heavy Exci&s;e upon Rum, Brandy, &amp;c. But this is nothing to the Importer, but to the Retailer of the&s;e Things.</P>
<P><HI>The Gentlemen &s;ays, I make a great noi&s;e about giving Twelve Shillings an Ounce for Silver.</HI> P. 6. When I am convinced that I have made more than there is cau&s;e for, I &s;hall be very &s;orry for it.</P>
<P><HI>He don't believe Three Thou&s;and Pounds of Silver per Annum, comes into the Province, &amp;c.</HI> I can tell him the Gentleman (of very con&s;iderable Trade) that affirms upon his own knowledge that above <HI>l.</HI> 10000. came in la&s;t Year from one Place. And there are enough in the Town
<PB N="8" REF="002190_0007_0FBCCC6BA6B4E3C8">
that can tell him the &s;ingle Ship which not very long &s;ince carried <HI>l.</HI> 10000. at once away; but Providence frown'd upon the Cargo and &s;unk it in the Sea.</P>
<P>What My&s;tery there may be in <HI>laying Fi&s;h in one Pile and Province Bills in another,</HI> I cannot tell. But the la&s;t Price Currant in the Gazette tells me Fi&s;h Mer|chantable 26. <HI>s.</HI> per Quintal and ri&s;ing, and now it is 28 <HI>s.</HI> this looks as if the Pile of Bills held out pretty well. I my &s;elf can tell the Men who paid Thirty Pounds a Ton for Oil la&s;t Week, and are ready to do &s;o again this Week. If Tarr and Turpentine lie a little upon hand, it is only becau&s;e our Corre&s;pondents abroad write us that they won't an&s;wer there. In &s;hort my Argument in the 17th Page of my former Letter is founded upon the matter of Fact. I believe we have yet Province Bills enow to buy up all the Produce of the Country fit for Exportation, and all the Silver and Gold be&s;ides, becau&s;e we have &s;een it done from Year to Year, and &s;ee it &s;till a doing every Day. However the Gentleman is of another Opinion, and mu&s;t tell me &s;o, tho' he gives no rea&s;on for it. Now whither his Opinion without any Rea&s;on, or my Rea&s;on founded on daily Ob&s;ervation will weigh mo&s;t, I mu&s;t leave to others to judge. For my own part I am &s;en&s;ible enough that if there be no more Bills Emitted, and if no way can be found to bring and keep Silver in the Country again, there will really be a pinching Scarcity of Medium in Time: but as yet I have never met with any good Rea&s;on to think but that we have Province Bills enough for any thing but to pay Labourers in Bo&s;ton, and Debts contracted by virtue of long Credit.</P>
<P><HI>The Gentleman &s;eems much concerned at your touch|ing upon the Law to &s;horten Credit, &amp;c.</HI> I am &s;o be|cau&s;e I have proved that the Welfare of the Country depends upon &s;hortening it yet more, and that doing this will remedy divers Evils which nothing el&s;e will.</P>
<P>I have no inclination to aggravate Mr. <HI>Colmans</HI> fault, nor to incen&s;e the Goverment again&s;t his Vindicator, and &s;o I &s;hall make to Reflection on what follows next
<PB N="9" REF="002190_0008_0FBCCC6D26208F20">
(which it may be &s;ome will call <HI>Amu&s;ement</HI>) and &s;e|veral other Pa&s;&s;ages that look the &s;ame way.</P>
<P><HI>Not the Plenty of Bills, but the Scarcity of Re|turns is the cau&s;e of Silver and Gold's being bought up and Ship'd off, &amp;c.</HI> A Strong Argument this if true, for &s;hortening Credit; for we &s;ee that tho' the Providence of God out our &s;hort Returns, yet Traders if left to their own way will continue to Import as much as ever. By this means the Silver and Gold is gone already, and if Tru&s;ting be allow'd our Lands will go too in a &s;hort time. But after all I mu&s;t tell the Gentleman, that if the Merchants had not Province Bills enough to &s;pare, they would not buy Silver and Gold with them. For he and every Body el&s;e know well enough that what Men &s;tand in real need of they value, and are loth to part with, and therefore if the Merchants really wanted Province Bills to carry on their Trade &s;o much as he pre|tends, they would never be &s;o Prodigal of them.</P>
<P>Again is our Scarcity of Returns Real or only Com|parative? If only Comparative I have told him already how that came to pa&s;s in the 2d. and 3d. Pages of my former Letter. There I told him that when the Go|vernment fir&s;t Emitted Province Bills, the Traders quickly improved the Advantage put into their hands to Import Foreign Commodities, in far greater quan|tities than the Produce of Country wou'd make Returns for, &amp;c. Thus Returns became Comparatively Scarce, and &s;o Silver and Gold was bought up with the Province Bills, and Shipp'd off, to make Returns with. But this is an Argument, which our Author (<HI>like a Wi&s;e Man</HI>) cared not to run into, and therefore tho't it <HI>nothing to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e</HI>; I &s;hall not therefore pur&s;ue him fur|ther with it.</P>
<P>Our Author thinks the Scarcity of Returns to be Real, and tells me I don't con&s;ider we have lo&s;t our <HI>Bay Trade.</HI> I confe&s;s I did not con&s;ider it, for I knew we had had &s;eve|ral Ve&s;&s;els from the Bay this Year already; and One of them was in the Harbour but La&s;t Week. But I con|&s;ider'd that the Bay Trade was no &s;uch mighty Article
<PB N="10" REF="002190_0009_0FBCCC6ED40E8D50">
as he pretends. The Spaniards have always in time of Peace, as well as War, given us all the Di&s;turbance they could in it.</P>
<P>The failing of our <HI>Newfoundland Trade</HI> is owing in a great mea&s;ure to the failing of the Fi&s;hery there of late Years; upon which account the Number of People is much dimini&s;ht, and con&s;equently their Demands for Provi&s;ions. But if our Trade thither be le&s;&s;en'd by this means, yet the failure of the Fi&s;hery <HI>there,</HI> hath brought <HI>our</HI> Fi&s;h to a better Market.</P>
<P>Our Author goes on to tell me, <HI>That the Rea&s;on European Goods are &s;o high of late, is,</HI> (1.) <HI>Becau&s;e there are not near &s;o many Imported as formerly.</HI> (2.) <HI>The Scarcity of Returns helps al&s;o to keep up their Prizes, &amp;c.</HI> The putting the&s;e Two Articles &s;o near together hath quite ruin'd all the Cau&s;e. I doubt Men of <HI>but a common Under&s;tanding</HI> will be vain enough to imagine they &s;ee an incon&s;i&s;tency. It will be very natu|ral to enquire, if the Importation be &s;o &s;mall, how come Returns to be &s;o &s;carce? One wou'd think the Produce of the Country might well enough an&s;wer a <HI>&s;mall</HI> Importation. What need then of buying Gold and Silver too to help? In &s;hort let the Importation be greater or le&s;s, if it be more than, the Produce of the Country alone will make Returns for, it is too great &s;till for the Welfare of the Country; and while it continues &s;o, all the fine Projects in the World won't bring us to &s;ee Good Days again; for how is it po&s;&s;ible if the Country in general &s;pends more than it can pay for?</P>
<P>The Gentleman finds fault <HI>that I do not tell what the&s;e convenient Rea&s;ons are, at which I &s;ay a Cry is made THAT THE BILLS ARE HOARDED, &amp;c.</HI> I will tell him now if he needs Information. When Mea&s;ures have been well concerted to make a vigorous Effort for a Private or a Publick Bank, then &s;ome time before the next Se&s;&s;ion of the General A&s;&s;em|bly, &s;pecial care has been taken from time to time to make People &s;en&s;ible of all their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Tho' &s;ome of the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es have been &s;uch as the Body of the Peo|ple
<PB N="11" REF="002190_0010_0FBCCC702ACBA488">
made no Complaint of, nor tho't any thing about, 'till <HI>more &s;en&s;ible Per&s;ons</HI> put them in mind of them. Among other Artifices u&s;ual at &s;uch times, People have been told that the Bills are hoarded.</P>
<P>If the Bills are indeed hoarded, I could not imagine any Men under &s;o much Temptation to unfair Dealing in this matter, as tho&s;e that employ a great Number of Labourers, for the Rea&s;on given in my former Letter, Page 18, 19. However, I am far from charging them with it. I &s;ay there plainly, that I don't know that any &s;uch Thing hath been practis'd. If our Author hath found another Sett of Men, whom he <HI>knows</HI> to be guilty. I have nothing to plead in their Excu&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only ob&s;erve a Pa&s;&s;age which to me (perhaps for want of under&s;tanding,) &s;eems to be an incon&s;i&s;tency. He tells us <HI>tho&s;e who advance the Price of Silver and Gold hurt us</HI>; and he &s;ays very true: but how came our Author to be of this mind? In his <HI>Great</HI> Argument for a Private Bank, Page 5. He tells us <HI>that it is and always will be the Intere&s;t of every Private Man to undervalue the Publick Bills by Selling his Silver to the highe&s;t Bidder.</HI> If this be the Intere&s;t of <HI>Every Private Man,</HI> then it is the Intere&s;t of the Country in General; for all the Private Per&s;ons contain'd in it, will make up the whole Country; How then could our Author think <HI>Ad|vancing the Price of Silver hurts us?</HI> Now let the Reader &s;ay how well it becomes a Gentleman who writes at this Extraordinary rate, to wi&s;h others to <HI>write per|tinently,</HI> and to charge them with <HI>Eva&s;ions, Mi&s;repre|&s;entations, Amu&s;ements &amp; Trifling.</HI></P>
<P>In the next Place he makes him&s;elf merry with my Project to leave off Tru&s;ting. In this place (like a wi&s;e Man) I &s;hall forbear <HI>running into this Argument,</HI> but I doubt I &s;hall be playing the Fool again before I have done my Letter.</P>
<P><HI>The Rea&s;ons given again&s;t a Private Bank I think are not unan&s;werable. However I &s;hall not enter upon that Argument, &amp;c.</HI> Wi&s;ely done! Arguments are dan|gerous Things. When a Man don't Know but that they
<PB N="12" REF="002190_0011_0FBCCC71A67AB158">
may prove unan&s;werable, it is much &s;afe&s;t to let them alone. But perhaps the Gentleman may wave <HI>this mat|ter for the pre&s;ent,</HI> hoping it will again be <HI>driven fur|ther, at a Convenient Sea&s;on,</HI> where (it may be) he thinks I &s;hall not be pre&s;ent to defend my Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>A Private Bank under the In&s;pection of the Govern|ment wou'd not be liable to that Objection,</HI> viz. <HI>That it will be in the power of the Bankers, to accompli&s;h any of their own Private De&s;igns, &amp;c.</HI> I believe any Man that duly con&s;iders the power of Money to bya&s;s Men's Thot's, and pervert their Actions will be of another mind.</P>
<P>I think <HI>I did not mi&s;-under&s;tand the Propo&s;al of For|tifying, &amp;c.</HI> For where People are Settled down already, it &s;ounds pretty odd to me, to talk of <HI>Encouraging them to &s;it down.</HI> Therefore I under&s;tood it of Settling Places as yet Un&s;ettled. But be that as it will; I hear|tily de&s;ire that what is already Settled (under the di|rection of the Government) may be well protected. If any great matters could be done at rai&s;ing Provi&s;ions in the Ea&s;tern Country, it would be a great Benefit to Bo&s;ton, for Supplies may be brought in from thence, at almo&s;t any time in Winter, which cannot be done from Con|necticut. However I hope &s;pecial Care will be taken that no Settlements be made, without the Allowance and Direction of the Government: for if People may go of their own Heads, and Settle where-ever they claim a Right, the Ea&s;tern Frontier will quickly be &s;o Enlarged, that &s;everal Thou&s;and Men will not be enough to defend it, in ca&s;e we &s;hould have another Indian War.</P>
<P>The Gentleman hath now almo&s;t done with <HI>me</HI>; How|ever, I &s;hall take notice of a few Things more in <HI>him,</HI> as I turn him over. In the 10th. Page he reckons up a terrible Catalogue of Evils, that will come upon us, <HI>when once the Bills are all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> To this I an&s;wer, Do but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ve off Tru&s;ting, as far as it <HI>may be left well enough,</HI> and Silver will come in, and &s;tay among us, to &s;ucceed the Province Bills as they are gradually call'd in. I &s;hall tell how this may be done pre&s;ently.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002190_0012_0FBCCC7327235150">In his 11th. Page he &s;ays the &s;hort An&s;wer in the News-Letter, which did but ju&s;t hint at things, <HI>gives no In|&s;tances of the Mi&s;chiefs a Private Bank would in|volve us in.</HI> I de&s;ire the Gentleman to look back to the 6th Page of my former Letter, and read it carefully. Then let him turn to the 20th &amp; 21&s;t Pages, and he will in tho&s;e Three Pages (I hope) find mi&s;chiefs enough in|&s;t need in. When he was at tho&s;e Places, <HI>He wi&s;ely de|clined entering upon the Argument,</HI> yet now He com|plains <HI>that we are all for general Terms upon this Head, and don't care to de&s;cend to Particulars.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But what cou'd the Gentleman mean, &amp;c.</HI> Page 12. I &s;uppo&s;e he meant that Bridges, Fortifications, &amp;c. are <HI>great and expen&s;ive</HI> Works. See Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed State, pag. 8.</P>
<P>In his 13th. Page, He tells us that Country People &s;ay <HI>that they can't improve their Lands for want of Money to hire Labourers, &amp;c.</HI> I think he tells us el&s;ewhere that he hath lately <HI>travel'd in the Country.</HI> I al&s;o have tra|vel'd in the Country, and liv'd in it too, but never heard this Complaint before. I have often heard in many parts of the Country, from very intelligent Per&s;ons, that it was an hard matter to find Labourers: and that La|bour was &s;o dear, that it turned to little or no Account to improve their Lands, if they mu&s;t hire Labour. But I never heard before that they could not get Money to hire Labourers with, if they would work at a rea&s;ona|ble rate. The Gentlemen of our General A&s;&s;embly will be the proper Judges of this matter.</P>
<P>I heartily join with the Gentleman in his wi&s;hes that all would &s;incerely &s;tudy the Publick Good, and that Men of Wi&s;dom, Fidelity and an Excellent Spirit may be cho&s;en Coun&s;ellours; and that the Governour and General A&s;&s;embly may have the Guidance and Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven in their Con&s;ultations for our Welfare.</P>
<P><HI>Something mu&s;t be done, or the Place will &s;ink and the Trade come to nothing, &amp;c.</HI> I que&s;tion not but the Ca&s;e of Bo&s;ton is really very bad, but how comes it to be &s;o? If the Gentleman can obtain an Act of the Gene|ral A&s;&s;embly to cru&s;h the <HI>Foreign Trade</HI> of other Towns
<PB N="14" REF="002190_0013_0FBCCC74B18DBAE0">
of this Province, which begins now to grow &s;o big; and it he can prevail to have Country People di&s;couraged from making their own Cloaths &s;o much as of late they begin to do; Bo&s;ton will revive it's Trade, without the help of either Private or Publick Bank. But after all I hope and believe the ruin of Bo&s;ton is not &s;o near, as the Gen|tleman &s;eems to apprehend. The Trade of Bo&s;ton is le&s;&s;en'd for the Rea&s;ons ju&s;t hinted at. And I &s;uppo&s;e as the Town in General, &s;o particular Gentlemen in it find their Bu&s;ine&s;s contracted con&s;iderably. Now when Men find their Means to be growing le&s;s than they have &s;ometimes been (tho' they may be like to be &s;ufficient &s;till, to live very well upon) yet (I &s;ay in &s;uch a Ca&s;e) they are very apt to be in a Fright and to think Pover|ty and Ruin are coming upon them like an Armed Man. And I believe this is pretty much the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>The Gentleman returns at length once more to me, and with great Sagacity <HI>perceives that all I drive at is, only that by calling in the Bills &s;ome Men may have an Op|portunity to get their Neighbours hands at half Va|lue, &amp;c.</HI> I have told him in my former Letter, page 18. that &s;uch a Thing will never be effected. But I &s;hall take this occa&s;ion to Explain that matter a little more. If any Men &s;et their Province Bills lie by them unimproved, in expectation that the Scarcity of them, will in a while rai&s;e their Value equal to Silver, I dare not charge them for it, with the Sin of <HI>Ahab in the matter of Naboths Vineyard,</HI> becau&s;e the Bills really ought to be in value equal to Silver, as the In&s;cription of them tells us they &s;hall be: and every Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of them is more or le&s;s a &s;ufferer in that in Fact they are not &s;o. But who the Men are that may be like to do thus by any great quantities of the Bills I can't pretend to gue&s;s. I can truly clear my &s;elf, and &s;ay that the few I have are imploy'd in Trade. And the Gentlemen in Trade I believe will Generally deny them&s;elves to be hoarders. As for the Gentlemen that Let their Money at Intere&s;t, I can &s;ee no Policy in <HI>their</HI> Letting their Bills lie unimproved neither. For by
<PB N="15" REF="002190_0014_0FBCCC762697A768">
Letting them out they increa&s;e their number, and &s;o will have more to make an Advantage of, if an Opportunity &s;hould pre&s;ent. Thus becau&s;e I could never &s;ee who&s;e Inte|re&s;t it was to hoard the Bills, I have taken the Cry about it, to be only a Stratagem to create Di&s;content and Animo|&s;ities among the People, and &s;o promote &s;ome Politick De&s;igns.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e I am mi&s;taken in this, and &s;ome Men really do hoard Bills expecting to make an Advantage of it, yet they will never get their Neighbours Lands at half Value. A Scarcity of Bills may po&s;&s;ibly rai&s;e their Value equal to Silver, and no Body will be wrong'd by this, for this is the Value they ought to go at. But if it once comes to this, the Man hath a mind to think hard|ly of the Government, who won't believe that it will ad|mit Mortgages to be redeemed and Taxes to be paid in the Produce of the Country or in Silver. In Silver (I &s;ay) for I hope before that Day, it will begin to &s;tay, and to pa&s;s from Man to Man in the Country.</P>
<P>I return therefore according to promi&s;e to my pro|po&s;al about the Limitation of Credit, and indeed had it not been for for the &s;ake of Explaining my tho't better about that matter, I &s;hould hardly have given my &s;elf or you the trouble of this Second Letter. I under&s;tand that I have been mi&s;taken to intend that no Credit at all &s;hou'd be given, becau&s;e I have expre&s;&s;ed my &s;elf in too &s;trong terms in one or two places; tho' afterwards I &s;peak only of &s;hortening it as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that &s;ome Credit is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary among Traders. And indeed if it were practicable to make &s;uch a difference, it wou'd an&s;wer all the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, if Credit were forbidden only to the Con&s;umers of Foreign Commodities. For if the Con&s;umers are not Tru&s;ted, then none of them can &s;pend more than they can Earn. And if &s;ome of them wont &s;pend &s;o much, then all things will follow of cour&s;e (as is argued in the 10, 11, and 12. pages of my former Letter) let the Traders carry on how they will among them&s;elves. But to make &s;uch a difference is impracticable, becau&s;e Traders them&s;elves
<PB N="16" REF="002190_0015_0FBCCC77AD9C9708">
are generally &s;ome of the greate&s;t Con&s;umers, and be|cau&s;e a Thou&s;and Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">f<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">s would &s;oon be found to Evade the Law, which no precautions could &s;ufficiently pro|vide again&s;t.</P>
<P>As to the Time it might be proper to re&s;train Credit to, I am a&s;&s;ured that &s;ome Sub&s;tantial Traders in the Town (who have as great Payments to make as almo&s;t any Men in New England) think it might well enough be Limitted to Six Months, but &s;uppo&s;ing it were al|low'd to run to Nine, or even to Twelve, and &s;top there, I believe it would have all the de&s;ired Effects. For as the Law wou'd not allow it's running beyond that time, &s;o the general practice wou'd re&s;train it to &s;omething &s;horter Limits. And if it were re&s;trained in the way I &s;hall propo&s;e pre&s;ently, the natural operation or the thing wou'd be &s;uch, that Tru&s;ting wou'd become daily more and more di&s;u&s;ed. And the le&s;s Tru&s;ting &s;hall be practi&s;ed, the better Circulation what Money we have will be put into, and &s;o there will be the le&s;s need or temptation to Tru&s;t.</P>
<P>I don't propo&s;e that an Act to &s;horten Credit &s;hou'd have regard to any thing that is <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> but only that it &s;hould look <HI>forward</HI> to &s;uch Debts as &s;hall be contracted after the pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch an Act. However, even &s;o I know it will be a very ungratefu Propo&s;al to mo&s;t Gentlemen that have already entangled their Affairs, or that are going upon va&s;t Undertakings, or that are Ambitious and Re&s;olved to Extend their Trade and Encrea&s;e the Importation of Foreign Commodities by all ways po&s;&s;ible, whither their Country &s;inks or &s;wims: but I earne&s;tly de&s;ire that all others, and even &s;uch as the&s;e&punc; &s;o far as they can forego their pre&s;ent private Intere&s;t for the Publick Good, in expectation of pro&s;pering together with the Publick hereafter, would con&s;ider deliberately the certainty and &s;afety of the Propo&s;al.</P>
<P>For to &s;ee the certainty of the good Effects of &s;horten|ing Credit, plea&s;e to look again on the 10, 11, 12, &amp; 13. pages of my former Letter.</P>
<P>As to the &s;afety of the Propo&s;al I think no Man can
<PB N="17" REF="002190_0016_0FBCCC7928AB1260">
doubt of this: whereas both the Publick and Private Pro|jects which have hitherto been &s;et on foot (con&s;idering the dependent &s;tate of this Country) have always been thought by many wi&s;e Men, liable to very dangerous Con&s;equences. It were ea&s;y to in&s;tance in Particulars: but I forbear, partly becau&s;e it would &s;well this Letter too much, but principally becau&s;e I wou'd not put an Argument again&s;t us for what hath been done already in|to any Man's mouth.</P>
<P>But how &s;hall Tru&s;ting be re&s;train'd in a natural and ea&s;y way? Why, &s;uppo&s;ing it be done Effectually it mat|ters not much what &s;afe way it is done in. However till &s;ome better way be tho't on, I humbly propo&s;e that after a Debt hath been contracted &s;o long as the Law &s;hall direct, Ten per Cent. Intere&s;t &s;hould be allow'd till it be paid.</P>
<P>I believe Sir, you &s;tart at the Propo&s;al, and think it the mo&s;t unhappy one I could have hit on. But if you can have patience deliberately and calmly to read and weigh what I have to &s;ay upon it, I flatter my &s;elf that before you have done, you won't think it a thing &s;o Un|rea&s;onable and Formidable, as very likely it will appear to mo&s;t Men at the fir&s;t glance.</P>
<P>For fir&s;t, it is no unrea&s;onable Favour to the Trader, who had rather have his Money to improve, than have it lying out, tho' at Ten per Cent Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>And &s;econdly the intention of &s;uch a Law, is not to give Ten per Cent Intere&s;t to the Seller, but to prevent the Buyer's running farther into Debt than he &s;ees any way of getting out again, in a rea&s;onable time. Now why any wi&s;e and hone&s;t Man &s;hould de&s;ire to do thus or &s;hould think him&s;elf wrong'd by being di&s;couraged from it I can't well imagine.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides 'tis certain no Law is too &s;evere &amp; &s;trict, that does but ju&s;t attain the Good End for which it was Enacted. Now if it be plain that continuing to Tru&s;t one another as we have done for many Years pa&s;t will unavoidably ruin the Country in a &s;hort time (which may ea&s;ily be demon&s;tra|ted if it be not &s;ufficiently done already in my former
<PB N="18" REF="002190_0017_0FBCCC7AA5FB05C0">
Letter) thence it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that if Ten per Cent. Intere&s;t won't put an Effectual &s;top to this practice, then &s;uch a Law wou'd really not be &s;evere enough, but the Intere&s;t ought to be encrea&s;ed (provided no better Remedy can be found) rather than the Country &s;hould be ruin'd. But if upon Trial allowing &s;uch an Intere&s;t for Book Debts be found Effectually to &s;top Tru&s;ting and Running into Debt; then &s;uppo&s;ing even Fifty per Cent Intere&s;t were allow'd no body would be hurt by it, be|cau&s;e every Body would keep clear of the danger of be|ing obliged to pay it.</P>
<P>But indeed the natural and nece&s;&s;ary Operation of the Thing would be &s;uch, that if Ten per Cent Intere&s;t were allow'd by Law for Book Debts, it wou'd certainly put an effectual &s;top to Tru&s;ting among all Wi&s;e and Hone&s;t Men; and &s;o none but Knaves and Tools cou'd po&s;&s;ibly be in danger by it. And 'tis highly probable that the former of the&s;e wou'd be kept more Hone&s;t and the latter be made wi&s;er by the Terror of it.</P>
<P>For the Buyer that would lie in Debt at the lo&s;s of Ten per Cent Intere&s;t, rather than borrow at Six per Cent to pay his Debt, &s;uch a Buyer (I &s;ay) wou'd by his Cre|ditor immediately be tho't a Pool or a Knave, or one that cou'd not obtain Credit enough to be Tru&s;ted with Money at Intere&s;t, therefore the Creditor wou'd never venture to let a Debt he in &s;uch a Man's hands but wou'd immediately Demands it of him, and force him to a Payment.</P>
<P>On the other hand if the Seller to encourage taking a large quantity of Goods off his hands, &s;hould promi&s;e the Buyer, to Tru&s;t him a Year or two beyond the time fixt by Law, without demanding any Intere&s;t, yet no wi&s;e Man would venture to lie in Debt upon this en|couragement. For tho' he may firmly believe his Cre|ditor, to be a Man of his Word, yet &s;ince he knows not how &s;oon he may be taken away by Death, therefore he can't be &s;afe after the time pre&s;cribed by Law is expired; becau&s;e if his Creditor &s;hould die &s;uddenly, he hath no &s;ecurity that tho&s;e who &s;ucced him, won't take the Ad|vantage
<PB N="19" REF="002190_0018_0FBCCC7C244E76D0">
which the Law gives them. For it can't be &s;up|pos'd that a Creditor who hath his Eyes in his head, will ordinarily venture by an In&s;trument under his hand, to put it out of his own and his Succe&s;&s;ors power, to demand a Debt, whatever nece&s;&s;ity for it may happen to ari&s;e, either from his own or his Debtors Circum&s;tances. Now unle&s;s it be put out of the Creditor's power to Demand it; the Debtor can't be &s;ecure, that the Advantage of the Law won't be taken.</P>
<P>Again the Merchant who Sells large quantities of Goods at once to the Shopkeeper may very conveniently take the Benefit of the Law, and demand Intere&s;t of the Shopkeeper, if he lies in his Debt after the Expiration of the &s;et time. But the Shopkeeper who Retails &s;mall parcels of Goods, at &s;undry times, to many Per&s;ons, &s;cattered up and down the Country, and &s;ome of them in other Provinces too; will find &s;o much vexation, per|plexity, and impracticablene&s;s in Demanding Intere&s;t of the&s;e Con&s;umers for their petty Debts, at &s;undry times contracted; that being him&s;elf &s;o Obnoxious to the Mer|chant (as is &s;aid before) he will certainly never dare to tru&s;t any Body, but will fell only for ready Money. Now if the Shopkeeper takes ready Money for all he &s;ells, he can then as well pay the Merchant as not; unle&s;s he is &s;o fooli&s;h as to &s;pend more in his Family than his Advance upon his Goods will an&s;wer for. And if he does &s;o, he will &s;oon ruin him&s;elf, whither he pays Intere&s;t or not.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Things it &s;eems plain, that if a Law to allow &s;uch Intere&s;t were Enacted, it would compleatly attain its end, to put an effectual &s;top to Tru&s;ting, in &s;uch a natural and nece&s;&s;ary way, that hardly any Body wou'd ever come to &s;uffer the Penalty of it. And then certainly no Body hath any rea&s;on to fear it.</P>
<P><Q>Upon the whole, Extravagant Importing and &s;pend|ing upon Foreign Commodities hath undone us, &amp; wou'd &s;oon impoveri&s;h the be&s;t Country in the World. Ex|travagant Tru&s;ting hath made way for the practice of the&s;e Evils. The General Court cannot take away the inclination of the People to &s;uch Extravagancies;
<PB N="20" REF="002190_0019_0FBCCC7E0D81A828">
this is the work of God. But ina&s;much as it is in their power to &s;horten Credit, &s;o as to put a &s;top to the practice of them, it is in their power to &s;ave this Peo|ple if they plea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>I know that the Propo&s;al of &s;hortening Credit &s;till more than it is already, will be very ungrateful to many People: But yet I am &s;o &s;atisfied of the &s;afety of it above other Projects, and the good Effect it would quickly have upon us, that I could not choo&s;e but communicate my tho'ts upon this matter, and wi&s;h that they may take place. However as is intimated in the beginning of this Letter, I have had &s;ome other tho'ts of another nature, which I know wou'd he abundantly more grateful to the Town, and I hope not Un&s;afe nor Impracticable: The&s;e I intend in a &s;hort time (if nothing unexpected prevents me) to put into Order, and if there be Occa&s;ion offer them to the Publick View.</P>
