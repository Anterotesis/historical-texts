<P>The God of I&s;rael &s;aid, the Rock of I&s;rael &s;pake to me, He that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God:</P>

<P>_THE la&s;t Words of great &amp; good Men, are accounted Worthy of an attentive ob&s;ervation, and affectionate Remembrance. The Words now read are call'd the la&s;t Words of <HI>David, i. e.</HI> &s;ay Expo&s;itors, Some of the la&s;t which he &s;pake by the Spirit of God, a&s;&s;i&s;ting and directing him in an Extraordinary Manner; or &s;uch as he often repeated to his la&s;t breath, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pool, Mr. Henry</NOTE> But indeed a greater than

<HI>David</HI> is here: He was a Royal Prophet, and &s;pake as in&s;pir'd by the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> v.2. <HI>The Spirit of the Lord &s;pake by me, and his Word was in my Tongue.</HI> The Spirit of God &s;ugge&s;ted the&s;e words to him, and govern'd him in the delivery of them: 2 Pet. 1.21. <HI>For the Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God &s;pake as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> They were under the unerring guidance of this Divine Per&s;on as to the Matter and Words of the holy Scriptures; &s;o that what they thus &s;pake mu&s;t be receiv'd not as the <HI>Word of Man,</HI> but as it is in truth, the <HI>Word of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>AND here I may ob&s;erve by the way, That ina&s;|much as it follows in the Words of my Text, The God of I&s;rael &s;aid, the Rock of I&s;rael &s;pake to me&mdash;Some &s;uppo&s;e here's an intimation of the Three glo|rious Per&s;ons in the Trinity; The Father, the GOD of I&s;rael, the Son, the Rock of I&s;rael, and the Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, who &s;pake by the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and particularly <HI>by the Mouth of his &s;ervant David.</HI> Whether this be the Truth of this Place or no, It is certainly a funda|mental Article of our holy Religion, to be firmly believ'd becau&s;e GOD hath reveal'd it. 1 Joh 5.7. <HI>For there are Three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Gho&s;t, and the&s;e Three are One.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Words of my Text, We may ob&s;erve, 1. <HI>The Per&s;ons &s;peaking</HI>: The GOD of I&s;rael &s;aid. GOD is in a peculiar Manner the GOD of his I&s;rael, their Covenant GOD. The Rock of I&s;rael; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by whom, as we have already hinted, &s;ome under&s;tand the Son of GOD, who is One with his

Eternal Father in the Divine E&s;&s;ence, and is the Rock on whom the Church is built, the Strength and Support, Defence and Safety of his People. 2. We may ob&s;erve, <HI>to, or of whom &mdash;. To me,</HI> i. e. To <HI>David,</HI> by way of <HI>Precept</HI>; or <HI>of me,</HI> i. e. of him, or his Hou&s;e, by way of Prediction and <HI>Promi&s;e.</HI> 3. <HI>What is &s;aid.</HI> He that ruleth over Men &mdash;. Some under&s;tand the&s;e Words as a Prophecy, and read them after this manner, There &s;hall be a Ruler over Men, or among Men, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> <Q>who tho' he be the invi&s;ible GOD, yet &s;hall vi&s;ibly ap|pear &amp; Rule among Men.</Q> Thus the words con|tain a Prophecy of our <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the Son of <HI>David,</HI> and of his Kingdom, who is in an appro|priate Sen&s;e, <HI>the Ju&s;t One,</HI> and being filled with the Spirit, de&s;erved this Character in Perfection, both re&s;pecting his Per&s;onal Qualifications, and the Ble&s;|&s;ed Fruits of his Reign; which are truly more Plea|&s;ant and of greater and more exten&s;ive U&s;efulne&s;s than the Light or Rain of Heaven. And thus it may be &s;uppos'd that <HI>David</HI> reflecting on the Ca|lamities already brought on his Hou&s;e, and fore|&s;eeing by the Spirit, that the Glory of it would &s;till further decay and fade as a Leaf; refre&s;heth him|&s;elf with the Con&s;ideration of the Coming of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> his Son and Succe&s;&s;or, and his Lord, in who&s;e mo&s;t righteous &amp; happy Government, not his Family and People only; but even the whole World were to be Ble&s;&s;ed. And this Sen&s;e may &s;eem to be favoured by what immediately follows, Ver. 5. <HI>Altho' my hou&s;e be not &s;o with God; yet he hath made with me an Everla&s;ting Covenant, ordered in all things and &s;ure: for this is all my &s;alvation, and all

my de&s;ire, altho' he make it not to grow.</HI> But then, others under&s;tand the&s;e Words as &s;poken to <HI>David</HI> by way of Precept, <Q>and &s;o they are a Declaration of the Duty of Kings, particularly of <HI>Solomon</HI> his Son and of his Succe&s;&s;ors the Kings of I&s;rael, for who&s;e In&s;truction he gives this Rule.</Q> Our Tran|&s;lation favours this Interpretation. And indeed the&s;e Words contain an Excellent De&s;cription of the Duty of Civil Magi&s;trates, of the King as Supream, and of &s;uch as are under him in place of Power. They mu&s;t be Ju&s;t towards Men, which in the large Sen&s;e of the Word, comprehends the whole of our Duty towards our Neighbour, according to the Place and Relation we &s;u&s;tain, and &s;o includes Clemency, Mercy, and the like, which in &s;ome Ca&s;es are Ju&s;|tice. And then this Ju&s;tice to Men mu&s;t flow from an inward Principle of holy Fear towards GOD, who is the Fountain of all Power, and be regulated by it. And then, the 4th Ver. <HI>He &s;hall be as the light of the Morning &mdash;.</HI> May be a De&s;cription of the Pro&s;pe|rity &amp; Glory of &s;uch Rulers, and of the happy Fruits and Effects of their Admini&s;trations with re&s;pect to the People under their Government. God will be Pre&s;ent with &s;uch to uphold and &s;ucceed them, &s;o that they &s;hall come in, and go out before God's People in the Strength of the Lord, as the Sun when he goeth forth in his might; and come down upon them as the Rain, as the &s;howers that water the Earth, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 72.6. They &s;hall be to the <HI>Moral World,</HI> what the Sun and Rain are to the <HI>Natural, Great</HI> and Exten&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ings; and their Wi&s;e and Ju&s;t Government will, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD pro|duce Fruits no le&s;s grateful and beneficial to their

<P>THE Rock of I&s;rael &s;pake to me. This is One of the Names and Titles whereby God is pleas'd to make him&s;elf known to his People. GOD is in Scripture frequently &s;poken of and &s;hadow'd forth to us under this Metaphor, in which we have &s;ome imperfect Repre&s;entation of GOD's Everla&s;ting and Unchangeable Being, who&s;e Name is JEHOVAH, and I AM THAT I AM; of his invin&s;ible Power; of the Stability &amp; Firmne&s;s of his Coun&s;els, Promi|&s;es and Providential Di&s;pen&s;ations in the World. Deut. 32, 4. <HI>He is the Rock&mdash;.</HI> This Title is gi|ven him about Six times in this Chapter. And then,
<PB N="6" REF="002583_0009_0FE5D439CE5A7810">
He is the Rock of I&s;rael, of his Covenant-People. His Ancient People call him <HI>their Rock, v.</HI>31. GOD is the Strength of I&s;rael. their Defence and Strong Tower, in whom alone they have a &s;ure Place of Re|fuge when pur&s;ued with threatning Evils. If it be demanded how that GOD who is a Con&s;uming Fire to Sinners, becomes a Rock of &s;afety &amp; refre&s;hment to any of the Sinful Children of fallen Adam, It mu&s;t be &s;aid, That the Eternal Son of GOD, who is the Great GOD our Saviour, was in the fulne&s;s of Time <HI>&s;ent forth made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law</HI> &mdash;: He is God-Man Mediator, and in Him GOD is the Rock of Salvation to his People. He is in Scripture call'd a Rock, 1 Cor. 10.4. &mdash; <HI>That Rock was Chri&s;t.</HI> The Son of GOD was prefigur'd by the Rock mention'd, <HI>Exod.</HI> 17.6. which being &s;mitten gave forth waters in abundance, which followed the I&s;raelites in their Marches thr&ocirc; the dry &amp; bar|ren Wilderne&s;s: For thus the Son of GOD in our Nature, having been &s;mitten by GOD, when he was made a Cur&s;e for his People, became a Fountain Open'd in the Merit of his Obedience, and in the abundant Effu&s;ions of His Spirit, who&s;e Graces and Comforts are as Streams and Rivers of living Wa|ters for the comfortable &s;upply &amp; refre&s;hment of his People, <HI>Job.</HI> 7.37&mdash;39.

On him, God's Spiritual Hou&s;e the Church is built, and by him the &s;everal parts are united &amp; &s;upported.

GOD, <HI>is the Rock on which the Church is built,</HI> and therefore the Gates of Hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it, <HI>Matth</HI> 16.17, 18. Again, The Son of GOD is unto his People as the <HI>Shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land,</HI> I&s;ai. 32 2. If the&s;e and the foregoing words refer to <HI>Hezekiah</HI>; yet they are &s;uppo&s;ed by good Expo&s;itors to look thr&ocirc; him to Chri&s;t the great Antitype, who affords his People a cool and mo&s;t refre&s;hing Shade under which they may &s;it with great delight, being defended from the &s;corching heat of GOD's wrath, from the Cur&s;e of the fiery Law, and from all tho&s;e Calamities which their Sins have de&s;erved In a Word, He is the Fortre&s;s and Strong tower to which they may fly for Refuge to lay hold on the hope &s;et before them, when pur&s;ued by Revenging Ju&s;tice, and in which they may be &s;afe from all their Enemies.</P>
<P>USE. LET what hath been &s;aid <HI>Excite and En|courage peri&s;hing Sinners to fly to GOD in CHRlST, as the Rock of their Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>AND thus we all are by Nature, dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, and Children of wrath.

But if the Son of GOD be a &s;tone, &amp; rock of offence to you, You will &s;tumble &amp; fall into Eternal Perdition; and when he &s;hall in the Great Day of his wrath fall upon you, He will grind you to powder.

We have been in an high degree unmindful of the Rock that begat us, and forgotten God that formed us.

We mu&s;t &s;ay of our Enemies, <HI>Their Rock is not as our Rock</HI>; But alas!

And &s;hall we go on to provoke the Lord by our Sins till our Rock fell us, "<HI>quit his intere&s;t in &amp; relation to us</HI>". O let us not do it? For if God leave us, our Defence and Glory are de|parted. Let us not go from God with a perpetual back&s;liding; but let us Return to him by &s;incere Repentance; lay hold of his &s;trength and make Peace with him. Then we might hope to &s;ee that good word fulfilled in us.

The principal End of Govern|ment next to the Glory of GOD, the la&s;t End of all things, is the Good of Civil Societies &amp; Communities of Men. <Q>Let Rulers remember, that they Rule over Men, not over Bea&s;ts whom they may en&s;lave and abu&s;e at plea&s;ure, but over rea&s;onable Crea|tures, and of the &s;ame Rank with them&s;elves</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Henry in</HI> Loc.</NOTE>.</P>

Tho' they Rule over Men, yet they are under the Law of GOD as well as others, and mu&s;t teach others Obe|dience by their ready and chearful Subjection to it.

Again, They mu&s;t know how to <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s their ve&s;&s;els in &s;anctifica|tion &amp; honour, and not in the lu&s;t of uncleanne&s;s,</HI> for this is one of tho&s;e Sins which e&s;pecially corrupts and infatuates the Mind.

and take heed they take no Advantage from the higher ground they &s;tand upon, to over-reach or oppre&s;s their Brethren of low Degree. They &s;hould not endeavour to engro&s;s all Advantages to them|&s;elves; but declare by their Practice that they are de&s;irous that their Nei'bours &s;hou'd thrive and grow in their E&s;tates al&s;o, in &s;ome Equitable Proportion.

Thus &s;uch as are in publick Place &s;hou'd go before others in a Con&s;picuous Exam|ple of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that they may Call upon their People to follow them, &amp; &s;tir them up to attend their Duty in the&s;e re&s;pects. Thus they &s;hould do their Endeavour to bring the Duties of the Second Table into Repute among their People. O there might, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, be a great deal of Good done this way, if &s;uch as are called gods would be imitators of GOD the Ju&s;t One, and followers of that which is Good. Such Examples wou'd be likely to attract the Eyes and Hearts of Men, and wou'd have an Excellent tendency to promote Ju&s;tice among a People; and the &s;etting them is a Debt which Civil Rulers owe to GOD and their Country.</P>

<P N="1">(1) <HI>RULERS mu&s;t take Care that &s;uch be En|trusted, with the Executive Power under them, as are be&s;t qualified, and &s;pirited to Execute Ju&s;tice.</HI> There are various orders and degrees in Civil Go|vernment, and accordingly &s;ome are intru&s;ted with Authority to Commi&s;&s;ion others for the Admini&s;tra|tion of Ju&s;tice in this or the other Po&s;t of Civil Tru&s;t.

Thus when that Excellent Governour <HI>Nehemiah</HI> had mentioned &s;ome Mal-Admini&s;trations of former Governours where|by they oppre&s;&s;ed the People, he vindicates him&s;elf, and &s;ay's, <HI>But &s;o did not I, becau&s;e of the Fear of God,</HI> Ch. 5.15.

The Fear of God mu&s;t have a govern|ing influence upon Rulers in accepting of Places in Government, and in di&s;charging the Duties of them; in making and Executing Laws; or in Committing the Executive Power to others: They mu&s;t in this re&s;pect Honour them that Fear the Lord.

Word of God is profitable for the In&s;truction of all Men in their &s;everal Places, that they may be fur|ni&s;hed to every good Work. Particularly, Here are mo&s;t Excellent Rules and Precepts given to all in Authority; and they Rule in the Fear of God, when they Rcligiou&s;ly ob&s;erve them, and thus Serve their Generation by <HI>the Will of God,</HI> which is given as the Character of that Pious King <HI>David,</HI> Acts 13.36. Agreeably the King of I&s;rael was Commanded to write a Copy of the Law, and to Read therein all the Days of his Life: <HI>that he might learn to fear the Lord his God</HI>; and to keep the words of the Law&mdash;, foremention'd <HI>Deut.</HI> 17.18, 19. Indeed I do not &s;ay that the Con&s;titution of Civil Government is ju&s;t the &s;ame now, that it was then, when Gods People were under a <HI>Theocracy,</HI> and had their judicial Laws appointed immediately by God. However there are tho&s;e Rules laid down in God's Word, which are of general U&s;e and Obligation to Rulers. They mu&s;t not forbid any thing which God hath required in his Law, nor command any thing which he hath for|bidden; for this wou'd be to e&s;tabli&s;h Iniquity by Law, in Defiance of the mo&s;t High. It is the Duty of all in Authority, who have God's Statutes, to make them the Rule of their Government, and to have a &s;trict regard to them, in Making &amp; Executing the Laws of the Land. This is to Rule in the Fear of God:_And thus mu&s;t Rulers acknowledge their Sub|jection to Him, who is over all, God ble&s;&s;ed forever.</P>

And God did miraculou&s;ly protect <HI>Daniel</HI> in his Pi|ous oppo&s;ition to that wicked Decree. Rulers mu&s;t be willing that their Subjects &s;hou'd obey GOD ra|ther than them. But then it is their Duty to behold his imitable Perfections, and to be imitators of him as dear Children. That Exhortation may be applied to them, who are called the Children of the mo&s;t High, Matth. 5.48. <HI>Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</HI></P>

of it. They mu&s;t take Care that the open Profe&s;&s;ion and Practice of Religion be kept up among their People, and vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;e whatever hath a pub|lick tendency to &s;ubvert and overthrow it. And for this End, it is their Duty to make &s;ufficient Laws for the Puni&s;hing open Profanene&s;s and Irreligion, as Idolatry, Bla&s;phemy, Profane-Swearing, Sabbath-Breaking, and the like: And they mu&s;t look to it, that &s;uch atrocious Crimes have an heavy Puni&s;h|ment appointed them in the Law. They mu&s;t draw the Sword of Ju&s;tice, and &s;mite &s;uch heinous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, that their Iniquity may be upon their own heads, (if they refu&s;e to be reclaim'd,) and not cleave to the Publick.

And therefore if they wou'd promote true Piety a|mong their People they mu&s;t take heed that there be not a famine of hearing of the Words of Lord, by improving their Authority &amp; influence, that a Lear|ned and Orthodox, a Godly and Painful Mini&s;try, be maintained and &s;upported among them.
