<P>_THE King of Kings and Lord of Lords is the divine &s;peaker in the&s;e great words. And how au|gust and glorious he appears, as the anointed of the Father, on his mediatorial Throne! His un|limitted &s;overeignty and ab&s;olute dominion, in and over all things, is clearly a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>HE, who was by nature the &s;upreme and migh|ty God, was plea&s;ed to take the form of a &s;ervant

and the fashion of a man, that he might &s;uffer the demerit of our &s;ins. He humbled him&s;elf and be|came obedient unto death, even the death of the Cro&s;s; for which God the Father <HI>hath highly ex|alted him, and given him a name above every name, that</HI> at <HI>the name of Je&s;us every kne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould bow&mdash;and that every tongue</HI> &s;hould confe&s;s that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Phil.</HI> 2.6.&mdash;11.</NOTE></P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, our Lord, after his re&s;urrecti|on, appeared in the clearer and more bright efful|gence of his Deity. In his e&s;tare of humiliation he did not lay a&s;ide his divinity, but &s;hrouded the glorious appearance of it with the weakne&s;s of hu|man fle&s;h. Yet, in the mean time, how frequent|ly did the &s;un break forth through tho&s;e clouds, in the wonderful miracles he wrought?</P>
<P>BUT now, having fini&s;hed tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion in his ex|piatory &s;acrifice, and ri&s;en triumphant over death and hell; as the due reward of his &s;ufferings, He has <HI>power over all fle&s;h,</HI> and <HI>all power in Heaven and Earth given unto him.</HI> In his mediatorial commi&s;|&s;ion, he has the grant of unlimitted dominion and government, He only <HI>excepted who put all things under him.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE we have this mo&s;t natural ob&s;ervation from the Text,
JESUS Chri&s;t is the head and fountain of all power.</P>
<P>THIS, by divine Help, I &s;hall endeavour to di&s;|cu&s;s by &s;hewing,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="7" REF="016019_0005_0F9B2553FA203408">I. What is intended by power, and all power.</P>

<P N="1">I. I am to &s;hew what may be here intended by power, or all power in heaven and Earth.</P>
<P>POWER is a word of large and exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, e&s;pecially here, where our Lord declares it to be <HI>all power</HI> in Heaven and in Earth. So that we may well conceive that there is no kind of power, but it is, in &s;ome ju&s;t &s;en&s;e, his.</P>
<P>POWER &s;ignifies both <HI>right</HI> and <HI>ability</HI> to per|form any thing.</P>
<P>THERE is the power of &s;trength, and the pow|er of authority and dominion. And there is di|vine power, and the power of creatures. Among men there is civil, military and eccle&s;ia&s;tical pow|er; but Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the great head and foun|tain of all.</P>
<P>DIVINE power is infinite, and bounded by no|thing but the ab&s;olute will and plea&s;ure of the great &s;upreme. Hence this title is a&s;&s;umed by God, and abundantly attributed to him with infinite pro|priety, The ALMIGHTY. <HI>I am the Almighty God.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> 17.1.</NOTE> <HI>I know,</HI> &s;ays Job, <HI>that thou canst do every thing</HI><NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Job</HI> 42.2</NOTE> Whatever God wills to do, he does with infinite plea&s;ure. His almighty <HI>Fiat</HI> gives imme|diate exi&s;tence to things, and nothing can re&s;i&s;t. It equally creates, pre&s;erves and governs all things.
<PB N="8" REF="016019_0006_0F9B2554B832D358">
How marvellous and &s;urpri&s;ing the all-enlivening agency of the divine power, in every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive mo|ment, in every of the infinite variety and multipli|city of exi&s;tencies in the wide extended creation? And thus &s;ays our Lord, <HI>My Father worketh</HI> hi|therto, and I work<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> 5.17</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT divine power is not only manife&s;ted in the creation, con&s;ervation and gubernation of all things, but mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly, in the redemption and &s;alva|tion of mankind &s;inners by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who there|fore &s;ays <HI>All power is given unto me, in Heaven and in Earth.</HI> It was a work of almighty power, as well as of infinite grace, to make &s;atisfaction for our &s;ins: and, at the &s;ame time, to make a com|pleat conque&s;t of the rebellious powers of infer|nal darkne&s;s. On the cro&s;s our great Lord &s;poiled principalities and powers.</P>
<P>THE work of effectual calling is a work of al|mighty power, when our Lord rai&s;es the dead &s;in|ner from his long &s;leep and death in &s;in, to a new and divine life, and &s;trengthens him to faith and calling upon God. Therefore we read, <HI>You hath be quickned, who were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Epho&s;.</HI> 2.1.</NOTE> <HI>The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead &s;hall hear the voice of the &s;on of God; and they that hear &s;hall live</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> 5.25.</NOTE> <HI>Who believe according to the working of his mighty power, which be wrought in Chri&s;t when he rai&s;ed him from the dead.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Epho&s;.</HI> 1.19, 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>MOREOVER, the guardian&s;hip and protection of the Church, amid&s;t all the wickedne&s;s of their own hearts, men and devils; and of every danger, through this world, to the heavenly kingdom, is a work of powerful grace.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="016019_0007_0F9B25560F8A0ED0">BUT there is not only the power of almighti|ne&s;s in God, but al&s;o of <HI>Authority</HI> and <HI>Dominion. Dominion and fear are with him.</HI> He is the great Lord and law giver of the univer&s;e. Being God, creator and pre&s;erver, he has a mo&s;t ju&s;t right to give law to, and govern all his creatures.</P>
<P>IN infinite wi&s;dom, the creator fixed a law of nature to every &s;pecies of Beings animate and in|animate. And according to that law is the &s;y&s;tem governed. Nature, or it's fixed laws, is nothing without him who is the God of nature. He ma|nages the ordinances of Heaven agreeably to his wi&s;e con&s;titution. The wide field of nature in this lower world, obeys his &s;overeign orders, and &s;ets a beautiful example of perfect &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to man, originally appointed it's ruler, made but a little lower than the Angels, and crowned with glo|ry and honour.</P>
<P>LAW was given to man. The original law our Maker gave us, commonly called <HI>the law of na|ture,</HI> was not a blind law of in&s;tinct, but the <HI>eter|nal rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> the <HI>moral law,</HI> agreeably to the nature of the divine perfections. The &s;pi|rit of this law was written on the heart of inno|cent man, for <HI>in the image of God made he them</HI>; and the great Creator po&s;itively enjoined his punc|tual obedience. Man is &s;till bound by the &s;ame authority; and Heaven and Earth &s;hall &s;ooner pa&s;s away than one jot or tittle of the law &s;hall fail, or be di&s;pen&s;ed with. <HI>Jehovah</HI> will maintain his au|thority over his rea&s;onable creatures, be the con|&s;equence what it will to them,</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="016019_0008_0F9B25563933A958">HAD not man broken the law of his Creation, it would have been the &s;ecurity of his happine&s;s; but being broken, it's &s;anction mu&s;t take place without an equal reparation be made, for God is unchangeable. Ble&s;&s;ed be his name for our divine &s;urety Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>GREAT is the authority of God. He reigns in Heaven above and governs the myriads of ange|lic ho&s;ts and glorified &s;aints at his plea&s;ure. And un&s;peakably happy are they under his government. He reigns upon Earth, and nothing makes any &s;ubject unhappy or mi&s;erable under his dominion, but rebellion and high trea&s;on again&s;t his maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P>THERE is the power of creatures. Angels ex|cel in &s;trength, and they have principality and do|minion. Hence we read of thrones, dominions, principalities and powers in Heavenly places <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eph.</HI> iii, 10, <HI>Col.</HI> i, 16</NOTE></P>
<P>AND there is power and authority among men. The &s;trength of man is &s;mall and limitted, and &s;o is his authority. But authority among mankind is ab&s;olutely rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>ALL men, indeed, are by nature equal: and all have, mo&s;t certainly, an equal right to freedom and liberty by the great law of nature. No man or number of men, <HI>has</HI> or <HI>can</HI> have a right to in|fringe the natural rights, liberties or privileges of others: or to dominion or government over any one, but by his free con&s;ent per&s;onally, or by his legal repre&s;entative, God having created the hu|man &s;pecies upon a level.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="016019_0009_0F9B25A5EC48C6D8">BUT then, we are to con&s;ider that the alwi&s;e Creator has laid a foundation for &s;ociety in the cre|ation of man. It was not good for man to be alone. God therefore made, and in&s;tituted the &s;ociety of man and wife, which laid the foundation for larger &s;ocieties from one degree and ri&s;e to ano|ther, until it came to nations, kingdoms or com|mon wealths. Therefore when men, after their apo&s;tacy, multiplied upon the face of the earth, it was nece&s;&s;ary to form into political and civil &s;ocie|ty, and to have rules and laws for their protection and &s;afety; and to appoint guardians of the &s;ame, el&s;e the lives and properties of men could not be &s;afe from the outrages of the wicked, who paid no regard to any law, but of &s;in and corrupt nature. So that the true original end of civil government was, the &s;afety and happine&s;s of the people; that every man, &s;o far as po&s;&s;ible, might enjoy his im|munities and privileges in peaceable and quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>WE read, <HI>The powers that be are ordained of God.</HI> But for what purpo&s;e? <HI>He,</HI> namely the ci|vil magi&s;trate, <HI>is the mini&s;ter of God to thee for good; but if thou, do that which is evil, be afraid, for he beareth not the &s;word in vain: for he is the mini&s;ter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> xiii. 1&mdash;4</NOTE> And again we are told, <HI>The law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawle&s;s and di&s;|obedient, for the ungodly and for &s;inners, for unholy and prophane, for murderers of fathers and murder|ers of mothers, for man-&s;layers, for whoremongers, for them that defile them&s;elves with mankind, for men|stealers,
<PB N="12" REF="016019_0010_0F9B25A6788D18B8">
for liars, for perjured per&s;ons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to &s;ound doctrine</HI>hi.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1. <HI>Tim.</HI> i.9, 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHATEVER different forms of government have been &s;et up, among all nations &s;ince the flood, they have been, profe&s;&s;edly, &s;et up with the&s;e views. E|ven the wor&s;t of tyrants have openly profe&s;&s;ed the &s;ame, although their practice has been a palpable contradiction to them. And the mo&s;t barbarous heathen nations have found it nece&s;&s;ary to have e&s;|tabli&s;hed rules and cu&s;tomary laws &s;trictly ob&s;erved for the puni&s;hment of vice, and for the &s;afety of life, and pre&s;ervation of property.</P>
<P>THE people, under God, are the fountain of all authority among men. Even in the land of Pa|lestine, where their government was a Theocracy, and their God was their King, and rai&s;ed up their Judges and Kings by an extraordinary call, yet they did not enter upon government without the people's con&s;ent and appointment. Saul and Da|vid were particularly pointed out by God, and anointed by &s;pecial direction to Samuel the pro|phet. Yet, without, and until the people's accept|ance, they meddled not with any affair of govern|ment. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> 1. <HI>Sam.</HI> ix. 15, 16.10 1.17.21.24.11.15. 16, 12, 13.2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.4.5.1.2.3.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE people of any nation, country or commu|nity, have an undoubted right to &s;et up &s;uch form of government as they judge will mo&s;t effectually &s;ecure their &s;afety, pro&s;perity and happine&s;s: and to change and alter it, as they &s;hall find requi&s;ite for the good ends of government. And</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="016019_0011_0F9B25A739527428">EVERY ruler is, or ought to be, appointed by the people, and accountable to them. And for any officer to make his own private emolument, or per&s;onal honor his aim, is at once to deviate from the de&s;ign of his in&s;titution, and to enter upon the fir&s;t &s;tages of tyranny. The public good &s;hould ever be the highe&s;t aim, next to God and his own &s;oul, of every one con&s;tituted to any office in the State. But then,</P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary that the con&s;titution be well fra|med, and &s;uitably adapted, not only to the genius of the people, but agreeably to the great law of nature. And divine revelation, which gives us the mo&s;t perfect rules for the conduct of mankind, in every &s;tation and condition of civil and religious life, &s;hould be received, as a perfect &s;tandard, in the framing of all human laws. <HI>The law of the Lord is perfect.</HI> Yet as we are never to look for another theocracy &s;ince the Jewi&s;h is cea&s;ed, and their laws were fitted to &s;uch a &s;tate, it is nece&s;&s;ary that laws be made in every civil State, to an&s;wer the nece&s;&s;ities and conveniences of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>AND not only is it nece&s;&s;ary to the well-being and happine&s;s of every State, that there be a good con&s;titution, and good laws agreeably thereto, but good rulers, appointed by the people, for the due execution of them. In this ca&s;e Jethro's coun&s;el to Mo&s;es is worthy our ob&s;ervation. <HI>Moreover thou &s;halt chu&s;e out of all the people, able men, &s;uch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetou&s;ne&s;s, and place &s;uch over them.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> xviii.21.</NOTE> Rulers are over the people in their office, but their power is limitted by the con&s;tituti|on

and whenever they abu&s;e it, the people have right to a redre&s;s of their grievances; and to de|po&s;e them from their offices.</P>
<P>OFFICERS &s;hould be faithful, and be &s;upported by the people, for this is the mind of God. <HI>Where|fore ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for wrath, but al&s;o for con&s;cience &s;ake. For, for this cau&s;e pay ye tribute al&s;o: for they are God's mini&s;ters attending con|tinually upon this very thing.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> xiii 5, 6.</NOTE> Faithful rulers have, in proportion, a great weight, the weight of the State lying upon them: and they need much wi&s;|dom and fortitude that they may do worthily for God and his people.</P>
<P>EVERY one &s;hould be content with his place, and labor to fill his &s;tation with honor to him&s;elf and con&s;tituents. When once men are unea&s;y to act within their own &s;pheres, and covet to ri&s;e to higher preferments of honor or profit; when they are proud, haughty and ha&s;ty; when they treat their inferiors with &s;corn and contempt; when they wink and connive at vice, or are vicious them&s;elves, they &s;hew plainly that they are unfit to be tru&s;t|ed by the freemen of the State, and unworthy of their good regards. If &s;uch men are promoted, the con&s;titution is injured, and the laws violated with impunity. Oppre&s;&s;ion, de&s;poti&s;m and tyranny will &s;oon get off their &s;hackles, and pre&s;ently begin to lift up their <HI>Hydra heads,</HI> and, with wide &s;trides, &s;talk, like hideous mon&s;ters, over the extended country. Surely the people cannot well be too cau|tious who they promote to offices. As good rulers are a great ble&s;&s;ing to people, and highly de&s;erving
<PB N="15" REF="016019_0013_0F9B25A8B97EB830">
of their re&s;pects; &s;o, on the other hand, bad rulers are a &s;ore judgment, and de&s;erve the frowns of the public.</P>
<P>AGAIN, military power is al&s;o of God, and or|dained for the defence of the civil, and mu&s;t ever be &s;ubject to it, and regulated by it. But this I mu&s;t pa&s;s over.</P>
<P>ONCE more here, eccle&s;ia&s;tical power is wholly of a &s;piritual nature, and no ways connected with ei|ther civil or military power. Chri&s;t's <HI>kingdom is not of this world,</HI> not of a worldly nature. The con&s;titution is &s;piritual, <HI>the covenant of grace.</HI> The laws are &s;piritual, and the ordinances of a &s;piritual nature, given us in the word of truth, the great &s;ta|tutes of heaven; and the puni&s;hments are &s;piritu|al, being the &s;entences of Chri&s;t's mouth, who is the only king, Lord and law-giver of his church, and pronounced again&s;t offenders in his name, by his mini&s;ters. Therefore the civil magi&s;trate has nothing to do with this government. Only the ci|vil rights, priviledges and properties of the church are to be &s;ecured and defended by the civil powers.</P>

IMPROVEMENT</P>
<P>And this &s;hall be affayed in two u&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">I. USE of information and in&s;truction. And</P>
<P>FROM what we have heard of God's Almighti|ne&s;s we may infer,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE &s;afety and &s;ecurity of all that have ta|ken &s;anctuary under the divine wings. God is able to defend them, and will &s;urely do it, for he has promi&s;ed &s;aying, <HI>He &s;hall cover thee with his fea|thers, and under his wings &s;halt thou tru&s;t; his truth &s;hall be thy &s;hield and buckler.</HI><NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;.</HI> xci.4&mdash;16.</NOTE> Cha&s;ti&s;ement they &s;hall have, but this is not to be deemed evil, but good for them.

The almighty arm will defend them from the powers of darkne&s;s, confront and &s;ubdue all oppo&s;ition to their be&s;t good, and guard them to glory, beyond the reach of all enemies.</P>
<P N="2">2. We infer the inexpre&s;&s;ible, infinite danger, and mo&s;t exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery of God's enemies. What|ever their characters or &s;tations, their danger is in|finite. <HI>Thine hand &s;hall find out all thine enemies; thy right hand &s;hall find out tho&s;e that hate thee.

<P>O what an Almighty arm is lifted up over the impious hardened rebels again&s;t Heaven! <HI>And can thine heart endure, and can thy hands be &s;trong in the day that God &s;hall deal with thee?</HI> You may go on a little while, perhaps, in your mad defiance of your maker and your judge, and &s;purn at all the grace tendered you, mo&s;t freely and plentifully, in the ble&s;&s;ed go&s;pel, and take your cour&s;e, but <HI>in due time your foot &s;hall &s;lide.</HI> Me thinks I &s;ee crowns and &s;cepters thrown away as vile refu&s;e; and all the glit|tering glory of titles, honors, riches and Earthly profits contemned as the mire in the &s;treets. <HI>The kings of the Earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty men, and every bond man, and every free man biding them&s;elves in the dens, and in the rocks of the mounntains, &s;aying to the mountains and rocks, fall on us and bide us from the face of him that &s;ittteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of his wrath is come, and who &s;hall be able to &s;tand?</HI> Can we now refrain thinking of tho&s;e words of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, <HI>what &s;hall it profit a man if he &s;hall gain the whole world, and loo&s;e his own &s;oul?</HI> A portion in Chri&s;t is worth more than all the world,

O that great men, and rich men would not look upon them&s;elves above religion! <HI>Ha&s;t thou an arm like God? or can&s;t thou thunder with a voice like him?</HI> How very ab&s;urd for a glittering worm to vaunt it|&s;elf as above it's fellow worms when it's nature is the &s;ame, and as liable and as ea&s;y to be cru&s;hed to death?</P>
<P>SECONDLY, from what has been offered on the divine authority, we infer,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT it is mo&s;t rea&s;onable and ju&s;t. It is the authority of God our maker, of Chri&s;t our God and Redeemer. And authority over all is a natural and nece&s;&s;ary prerogative of the Deity. Nothing can be more re&s;onable than that the creator &s;hould be ab&s;olute proprietor of his creatures; and that he &s;hould give them laws and govern them to the greate&s;t and be&s;t end, his own glory. And impo&s;|&s;ible it is for him to err. His will mu&s;t be good in per&s;ection. And his laws mu&s;t be wi&s;e and good, for his will is not only good, but his under&s;tanding infinite. Therefore his authority is mo&s;t rea&s;ona|ble and ju&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE infer that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the divine go|vernment is our duty. And an imperfect &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion and obedience is far from the thing required. An imperfect obedience to the laws of the &s;tate, would rather be termed rebellion, or di&s;obedience, by the rulers. Though a man &s;hould keep the laws of the &s;tate in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, and vio|late them wilfully in one, he would be deemed guilty, and dealt with as a law-breaker. And &s;o di|vine in&s;piration argues, <HI>Who&s;eover &s;hall keep the
<PB N="24" REF="016019_0022_0F9B25AF7843F610">
whole law, end yet offend in one point is guilty of all; for he that &s;aid do not commit adultery, &s;aid al&s;o, do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the law.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>James</HI> ii, 10.11</NOTE></P>
<P>SURELY, if God be infinite and his law perfect and we read expre&s;sly that <HI>the law of the Lord is perfect,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;.</HI> xix.7.</NOTE> then a perfect &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience is our duty; and al&s;o a continuance therein, for it is written, <HI>cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gal.</HI> iii.10.</NOTE> Oh, if Chri&s;t had not mo&s;t perfectly o|beyed for us, the cur&s;e would have been our por|tion for ever: But ble&s;&s;ed be God, he has become obedient unto death for us, that who&s;oever believ|eth in him &s;hould receive remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and be freely ju&s;tified and &s;aved. Yet the believer in Je|&s;us mu&s;t be careful to maintain good works. In|deed the law is not a covenant of works for the believer, but a perfect rule of all holy living unto God. But I pa&s;s on to &s;ay,</P>
<P>THIRDLY, from what we have heard of autho|rity among men, we learn,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT that authority which is founded on the law of nature, and agreeably to divine revela|tion, is the authority of God, and the only autho|rity to be obeyed, all other power and authority being tyranny. True, many nations have &s;et up a con&s;titution of government, which has, in many things, been excellent, and many of their laws have been well adapted to the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate. The Romans &s;eemed to have excelled mo&s;t others, while they remained a Common Wealth,
<PB N="25" REF="016019_0023_0F9B25B038DC36A0">
But many encroachments were made upon the rights of the &s;ubject among them; and finally that empire has undergone &s;even or eight different forms of government. We indeed find that under one of the wor&s;t of tho&s;e forms, namely, their Emperors, Saint Paul directs chri&s;tians to be &s;ub|ject.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> xiii.1.</NOTE> But we are not to &s;uppo&s;e any are bound to be &s;ubject to any law or government, in any article again&s;t the rights of con&s;cience. The holy martyrs of Je&s;us have ever &s;ubmitted to the civil laws of the government they lived under, acknowledging their bodies and e&s;tates belonged to the king, or emperor, but their con&s;ciences they held free.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable, that toleration to thofe of a different religion from the &s;tate-religion, was but little con&s;idered as a matter of right, in but few countries; &s;o that &s;piritual tyranny and intolerance generally prevailed in the world from age to age,; And even in England, after they became profe&s;&s;ed prote&s;tants, they were no le&s;s &s;evere again&s;t di&s;&s;en|ters than the old pagans and papi&s;ts. And, as to civil liberty in the be&s;t regulated &s;tates, kingdoms and common wealths, there ever was a high de|gree of tyranny practiced again&s;t the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>ENGLAND has been one of the mo&s;t famous countries for civil liberty. The people, in almo&s;t every age, &s;eemed to have an abhorrence of de&s;|potilm, and have &s;hewn an uncommon zeal to &s;e|cure and e&s;tabli&s;h their privileges. Yet, notwith|&s;tanding their great <HI>Charter,</HI> and the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of the nation, almo&s;t every reign has been &s;tained with more or le&s;s acts of tyranny. And, in many reigns, what &s;cenes of the mo&s;t &s;avage barbarities
<PB N="26" REF="016019_0024_0F9B25B0F8D03850">
have been carried on, to the eternal infamy of the Henry and Stuart lines? In the mean time how have the pulpite rung with the &s;tupid doctrines of <HI>The Lord's anointed,</HI> and <HI>po&s;&s;ive obedience</HI> and <HI>non|re&s;i&s;tance?</HI> The nation groaned under the weight of oppre&s;&s;ion and arbitrary domination. Nothing could content the more than bruti&s;h tyrants but the ab&s;olute de&s;truction and wa&s;te of law, every privi|ledge, and the lives and fortunes of the &s;ubject. Happy revolution in 1688. But how has the old tyranny ri&s;en out of it's grave, and made a mo&s;t formidable attack apon the &s;ubject in the pre&s;ent arbitrary reign? This country, &s;en&s;ible of the va&s;t importance of it's priviledges, has thrown off the, yoke, and nobly taken up arms in it's own defence, determined to be free, or die in the virtuous cau&s;e, the great cau&s;e of Heaven and Earth. In depend|ance on the almighty Jehovah, we may expect com|pleat deliverance, and &s;ee this infant country a &s;eat of ju&s;tice, religion and Liberty.</P>
<P>UNHAPPY it would be, if the bad government we have been under &s;hould be a means of the peo|ple's neglecting a good government. Rather let it engage them the more carefully to e&s;tabli&s;h, main|tain and &s;ubmit to good government. But in this &s;inful world, we cannot expect a permanent &s;tate of peace, Liberty and pro&s;perity. Such is the cor|ruption, pride and avarice of fallen mans that it makes him like the <HI>troubled Sea when it cannot re&s;t.</HI> And the fir&s;t temptation, <HI>ye &s;hall be as Gods,</HI> is ve|ry apt to prevail, e&s;pecially in un&s;anctified men. Internal di&s;putes may embroil the whole land in a &s;cene of di&s;order, confu&s;ion and mi&s;ery. Or &s;en&s;u|ality luxury and di&s;&s;ipation &s;wallow up all our vir|tue,
<PB N="27" REF="016019_0025_0F9B25B1B8622C70">
enervate all our fortitude, and bring on a mean|ne&s;s and &s;ervility of &s;pirit, &s;o that we &s;hould ea&s;ily become the dupes and abject &s;laves of de&s;poti&s;m and tyranny. Indeed every &s;ort of vice leads the way to both temporal and eternal &s;lavery. But of all things ignorance opens the wide&s;t door to it; this paves the way to every vice, and di&s;ables a people from knowing the things of their temporal, as well as &s;piritual peace. How nece&s;&s;ary there|fore, to exert our&s;eleves again&s;t all wickdne&s;s, and to promote all u&s;eful knowledge? But e're I am aware I am carried too far here, and mu&s;t return.</P>
<P>THIS Que&s;tion may require an an&s;wer,</P>
<P>WHAT authority may be re&s;i&s;ted?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, Unlawful authority, and all lawful officers acting unlawfully. There have been many officers, lawfully and well appointed, who have act|ed unlawfully in their office: and when this is the ca&s;e, they &s;hould not be obeyed, but rather re&s;i&s;ted in a due manner.</P>
<P>OFFICERS are no better by nature than other men, and often have been wor&s;e by practice than tho&s;e in a private &s;phere. I need not call in a Hen|ry, a Stuart, a George or a North to witne&s;s in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e: we may find enough in this country &s;ince a Sir Edmund Andro&s;&s;, to prove the point. Such authority &s;hould be univer&s;ally oppo&s;ed with a manly firmne&s;, and an heroic virtue, until it be end|ed, and good and lawful authority e&s;tabli&s;hed. But &s;uch wicked men are the fir&s;t to plead <HI>law</HI> and <HI>au|thority,</HI> and to cry out <HI>rebellion</HI> and <HI>trea&s;on,</HI> even when they are &s;ubverting the con&s;titution, violat|ing their &s;olemn oaths, and depriving the people,
<PB N="28" REF="016019_0026_0F9B25B2788694C0">
both of their civil and religious right. And if &s;uch men are not re&s;i&s;ted we mu&s;t obey man rather than God. We mu&s;t &s;uffer all that is dear and va|luable for &s;oul and body, for time and eternity, to be unju&s;tly taken from us: We mu&s;t give up to lawle&s;s lu&s;t, ambition and tyranny; yea to de&s;pots and devils both. And can we endure the thought? Let it rou&s;e up every man, and excite a noble ar|dor to blot the name of tyranny out of the land, and to keep up a &s;teady firmne&s;s and un&s;haken re|&s;olution to defend and &s;upport true Liberty, and hand it down to po&s;terity as the be&s;t legacy we can be&s;tow on them.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE infer the nece&s;&s;ity of good rulers. <HI>If the foundations be de&s;troyed, what can the righteous do?</HI> A good con&s;titution, good laws and good magi&s;|trates are very nece&s;&s;ary to the well-being of a peo|ple. A &s;tate of anarchy is ever a &s;tate of di&s;order and confution. Inju&s;tice and every vice flouri&s;nes with impunity, and no man's life or property is &s;afe. How &s;ad were the times in I&s;rael when they were without government? When the Levite's concu|bine was forced 'till &s;he was dead, we read <HI>In tho&s;e days there was no king in I&s;rael; every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jud.</HI> xxi.25.</NOTE> There was no Judge, or &s;upreme magi&s;trate to put the laws in execution, and the people were lawle&s;s. It is there|fore evident that good rulers are ncce&s;&s;ary. Ma|gi&s;tracy is an ordinance of God, and of great im|portance to the people.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, is it as we have heard, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the head and fountain of all authority? Hence we infer,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="29" REF="016019_0027_0F9B25B33B692EC8">1. WHAT a glorious and wonderful head of go|vernment we have. Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the prince of the kings of the Earth. When rulers have hearts after his own heart; when they are &s;en&s;ible they de|rive their all from him; when they heartily own him for their head and &s;overeign, pattern after him in their lives, and copy his example in the execu|tion of their offices, they are ble&s;&s;ings in their high &s;tations, greatly u&s;eful to the State, and of va&s;t im|portance to the people. But when they forget the Lord's anointed, Chri&s;t their king, and &s;et up them|&s;elves in his feat, and u&s;urp his throne, they be|come oppre&s;&s;ors and lawlefs tyrants, O, but we, of all people in the world, have cau&s;e to own and acknowledge the prince of peace to be our &s;ove|reign. We have renounced the tyrant of Britain, and declaimed loudly again&s;t monarchical power; and have fet up to be a free people. We own no other prince or &s;overeign but the prince oft Heaven, the great &s;overeign of the univer&s;e. To him we &s;wear allegiance, and promi&s;e, through his abund|ant grace, to keep his laws.</P>
<P>THE ten moral precepts are a brief &s;ummary of the whole moral law, the great law of nature. And the ble&s;&s;ed bible gives us a perfect comment upon it. Hence the &s;cripture is &s;o frequently cal|led <HI>the law of the Lord.</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the law|giver, and the commentator.

<P N="2">2. WHAT a beautiful and lovely example have all rulers, even Je&s;us Chri&s;t the King of righteou&s;|ne&s;s and peace! Je&s;us Chri&s;t is an example of im|partial ju&s;tice, and all his admini&s;trations are wi&s;e, good and gracious. He never took any bribe, nor turned away the poor from his right. The rich and the poor are both alike unto him. And they who upon any pretence whatever, neglect or refu&s;e &s;o

<P>I now proceed to my &s;econd end la&s;t u&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">II. A u&s;e of address to this venerable Audi|ence upon this plea&s;ing and joyful occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>OUR eyes now &s;ee the foundation of a new re|publican &s;tate, laid on the noble&s;t principles of true patrioti&s;m, religion and liberty, con&s;piring the tem|poral and eternal weal of pre&s;ent and future gene|rations. And may heaven &s;mile upon it appoint|ing &s;alvation for it's walls and bu&s;warks!</P>
<P>IN &s;ome re&s;pects we have &s;uffered difficulties which no part of the United States of America have. We may therefore prize liberty the higher, and ta&s;te is the &s;weeter.</P>
<P>FROM the beginning of our &s;ettling in this late howling wilderne&s;s, we have groaned under Briti&s;h tyranny. How dark and gloomy that di&s;mal day when the&s;e infant plantations fell under the juri&s;|diction of New-York, who&s;e officers being the tools of the crown, were no le&s;s arbitrary and cruel, in their unrighteous oppre&s;&s;ions of poor people, in the mid&s;t of all the natural and nece&s;&s;ary hard&s;hips of a new &s;ettlement, than the &s;avage tyrant of En|gland their patron?</P>
<P>OUR legal Charters have been demanded of us, whereby our lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions have fallen into their unju&s;t hands: and enormous &s;ums demanded for their patents. Hone&s;t and virtuous people &s;ued out of their proper inheritance; others driven to
<PB N="32" REF="016019_0030_0F9B25B6022BFFF0">
the la&s;t extremities by the force of their murder|ous arms, The mo&s;t infamous men, who neither <HI>feared God,</HI> or <HI>regarded man,</HI> have been placed over us in the mo&s;t important offices, from whom we could not expect mercy or ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>As to religion, it &s;eems to have been a thing the lea&s;t known or regarded in their courts and a&s;&s;em|blies. And through the State the Lord's day has been, by a great part of rich and poor, a day of &s;ports and recreations. No provi&s;ion was made for the &s;upport of religion, but mini&s;ters have been left to all the hard&s;hips of a mi&s;&s;ion among Savages, ex|cept the charities of a &s;mall number of more &s;eri|ous and good people who&s;e lot fell among them. And truly &s;uch things mu&s;t be very di&s;agreeable to a virtuous people, brought up in the religious States of New-England, as the pre&s;ent inhabitants of this new State were. Such, and much more, have been our troubles under the crown officers of that State, And the con&s;titution and laws, &s;ince adopted by them, give the &s;tronge&s;t evidence of the &s;ame arbitrary principles yet remaining. Ble&s;&s;|ed be God who has looked upon our affiction, and given us a happy deliverance from that iron yoke.</P>
<P>AND when the enemy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>General Burgoyne with about 10000 Briti&s;h troops,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> came in like a flood up|on us, the la&s;t &s;ummer, and &s;pread &s;uch &s;cenes of horror and deva&s;lation, the <HI>&s;pirit of the Lord lifted up a &s;tandard again&s;t him</HI>: &s;o that after all his proud boa&s;ts, and haughty in&s;ults, <HI>he is fallen like Lucifer &s;on of the morning.</HI></P>
<P>ON this &s;urpri&s;ing and remarkable interpo&s;ition of Heaven, I would congratulate my country, the

<P>AND now, after laboring through inexpre&s;&s;ible di&s;tre&s;&s;es, divi&s;ions and hard&s;hips, our joyful eye&s; &s;ee the foundation of a new State laid. O, may the &s;uper&s;tructure be equal to it, and the ble&s;&s;ing of the Lord re&s;t upon it from generation to gene|ration, that it may be a habitation of ju&s;tice, a mountain of holine&s;s, and a dwelling of peace and truth forever.</P>
<P>I would therefore in the name of our great king Je&s;us, humbly offer a word to our civil Fathers of this new State.</P>
<P>FIRST to the Legi&s;lative Authority,</P>
<P>Truly worthy, and much honored Gentlemen,</P>
<P>You have a mo&s;t weighty and important part of government a&s;&s;igned you, by the freemen at the State. Legi&s;lation requires great wi&s;dom and &s;kill. Laws &s;hould be framed and &s;uitably adapted to the con&s;titution, the nece&s;&s;ities and conveniencies of the people; very plain and explicit to prevent, as much as po&s;&s;ible, di&s;putes, and that ju&s;tice may be done in giving judgement.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="016019_0032_0F9B25B6F8E8B9C0">AND, Sirs, it is a new bu&s;ine&s;s you are called to; work, which it is probable, you have been unu&s;ed to, not have had but little opportunity to con&s;ider. With propriety therefore you may adopt the words of Solomon, and, in them, humbly addre&s;s your great Lord, <HI>I am but a little child, I know not how to go cut, or come in&mdash;Give therefore thy &s;ervant an under&s;tanding heart</HI> <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Kings</HI> iii. 7.9.</NOTE> And we read The <HI>&s;peech plea&s;ed the Lord.</HI> Wi&s;dom is nece&s;&s;ary. And Chri&s;t our King &s;ays <HI>Coun&s;el is mine and found wi&s;dom. In him are hid all tbe treasures of wi&s;dom and knowledge</HI>; you will, therefore, be intreated humbly and ear|ne&s;tly to apply your&s;elves to him for guidance in the paths of judgment; that, by his all-governing influence, he would furni&s;h and a&s;&s;i&s;t you in the va|rious branches of the very important bu&s;ine&s;s lying before you, and enable you to go through it, to the la&s;ting good of the State, and your own honor and felicity.</P>
<P>AND as Chri&s;t is your Lord and King, you will pay a due regard to his laws. You will be in|treated to &s;eek the true &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit of them, heartily to believe and obey them, and to &s;et them always before you as an excellent guide in the framing of every law tor the State.</P>
<P>AND how nece&s;&s;ary is it, Sirs, that the be&s;t foundation be early laid for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of eve|ry vice, and the encouragement of every virtue? And as ignorance is a great &s;upport of vice, and opens a wide door to temporal, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and &s;piritual tyranny, you will wi&s;ely con&s;ider on the be&s;t means to promote the education of the ri&s;ing generations in all u&s;eful knowledge. As al&s;o the encouragement and &s;upport of the amba&s;&s;adors of
Chri&s;t our King; that his religion and intere&s;t may
<PB N="35" REF="016019_0033_0F9B25B7B9227AE8" MS="y">
be advanced, to the pre&s;ent and future good of the people. Of what importance this?</P>
<P>WE heartily commend you, Sirs, to him that is able to keep you, and to guide you by his unerring coun&s;el in the great work before you; &s;o that it may hereafter be &s;aid of this State, in &s;ome good &s;en&s;e, as the in&s;pired law-giver of l&s;rael, <HI>What na|tion is there &s;o great, that hath &s;tatutes and judg|ements &s;o righteous as all their law?</HI></P>
<P>SECONDLY I would with all due deference ad|dre&s;s the Executive authority of the State.</P>
<P>Worthy and honored Gentlemen,</P>
<P>You are God's mini&s;ters. Dread title! The &s;word you wear is the &s;word of the Lord; the &s;word of ju&s;tice to keep the peace of the State, and of each part within your province. The eyes of all, within the State, look up to you for ju&s;tice. And may the &s;upreme Executive power, and all our judges and ju&s;tices of the peace keep in view the infinitely great and &s;upreme Judge <HI>by whom all the judges of the Earth do rule,</HI> and ever &s;hake their hands from holding bribes.</P>
<P>PERMIT me, Sirs, to &s;ay we expect, and, what is inconceivably greater, Chri&s;t our &s;overeign ex|pects that each of you be terror to evil doers, and a prai&s;e to them that do well.</P>
<P>WE tru&s;t the honorable Legi&s;lature will furni&s;h you with good and whole&s;ome laws, without which we cannot expect you can do much. And may we hope, Gentlemen, that the general complaint, which ha&s; been long in England, and in all parts of this,
<PB N="36" REF="016019_0034_0F9B25B878C1F7E0">
country, more or le&s;s, may never be heard among us, The want of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>No man can number all the good and whol&s;ome laws that have been made in England and this country, again&s;t all &s;orts of vice, and that ju&s;tice might be done for the public, and between man and man; and yet how has vice appeared with it's brazen face, in open effrontery of all law and ju&s;tice? And what multitudes have &s;uffered for want of a &s;peedy execution of ju&s;tice? And the public has &s;uffered through a carele&s;s negligence, bribes, vicious rulers, or the artifices of bribed and perjured attornies.</P>
<P>MAY Heaven prevent &s;uch abu&s;es among us! And may you, Gentlemen, and your &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, no|bly exert you&s;elves to do ju&s;tice and judgment How worthy the practical ob&s;ervation of all rulers is the charge of good Jeho&s;haphat? <HI>And he &s;aid to the judges, Take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord who is with you in the judg|ment. Wherefore now, let the fear of the Lord be upon you: take heed and do it; for there is no iniqui|ty with the Lord our God, nor re&s;pect of per&s;ons, not taking of gifts.&mdash;Thus &s;hall ye do in the fear of the Lord faithfully, and with a perfect heart.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xix. 6&mdash;1O.</NOTE> We wi&s;h you much wi&s;dom and fortitude, and heartily pray you may go on and pro&s;per in the impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice and judgment, and that you may <HI>have boldne&s;s in the day of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THIRDLY, I would, in the next place, addre&s;s the freemen of the State.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN, you are as free citizens, and the whole power of the State falls yearly into your hands. Remember the &s;olemn oath you have ta|ken
<PB N="37" REF="016019_0035_0F9B25B938EFDDE0">
in the great name of the ever living God, and be not &s;wayed by intere&s;t, party or prejudice, in giving your &s;uffrages.</P>
<P>IF you have a proper &s;en&s;e of the great impor|tance and worth of our priviledges, you will look for men of God, <HI>men of truth, able men, &s;uch as fear God and hate covetou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and give your votes for &s;uch from time to time.</P>
<P>A good con&s;titution, all Liberty worth the name, and every thing dear and &s;acred may &s;oon be &s;ub|verted by wicked de&s;igning men, who are ever gap|ing for places of preferment and profit.</P>
<P>IT is a great deal you put into the hands of your repre&s;entatives. And men of no virtue, no prin|ciple or con&s;cience cannot be tru&s;ted, but with the greate&s;t peril.</P>
<P>AND be intreated, Sirs, to &s;eek the peace and pro&s;perity of your towns, and of the whole State: and labor to promote and encourage every virtue among your&s;elves, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of every vice. And, of what importance is it to your&s;elves and po&s;terity, that your hou&s;es be nur&s;eries of pie|ty and devotion? As al&s;o, that you &s;pare not to e|ducate your children in u&s;eful learning and the principles of our holy religion? Like faithful A|braham, command your children and your hou&s;holds after you to keep the way of the Lord, to do ju&s;tice and judgment.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> xviii.19.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND how nece&s;&s;ary is it, dear Sirs, that you &s;ettle able and faithful mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t in your &s;e|veral towns; that you and your children may en|joy a preached go&s;pel, and all it's ordinances and
<PB N="38" REF="016019_0036_0F9B25B9F8FE4948">
in&s;titutions according to the mind of Chri&s;t. And remember for your encouragement, that <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the people that know the joyful &s;ound.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;.</HI> 1xv. 15, 16, 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>ONCE more, and above all. I be&s;eech you to bow to our glorious &s;overeign prince. And may Chri&s;t our King reign in our hearts, in his &s;weet and benign influence! May he be crowned King upon the throne of your &s;ouls, and &s;way his &s;weet and peaceful &s;cepter there forever! Happy it would be to &s;ee his kingdom of grace flouri&s;hing in this State; and many flocking round his &s;tandard. Chri&s;t reigns in providence, and in grace: and he is al|mighty, he is lovely in both. How glorious is that kingdom which con&s;i&s;ts in righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t? How tran&s;cendently ami|able and lovely the King of glory, by whom kings reign, having all power in Heaven and in Earth! <HI>Thy kingdom come.</HI></P>
<P>FOURTHLY, I would offer a word to my Reve|rend brethren in the mini&s;try.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xvii. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>Reverend and dear Sirs,</P>
<P>IT is a peculiarly &s;weet con&s;ideration to us, that our divine lord and ma&s;ter has <HI>all power in Heaven and in Earth,</HI> and for this very purpo&s;e <HI>that be &s;hould give eternal life to us many as the Father has given him.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Addre&s;s to the Mini&s;ters, omitted in the Delivery, by rea&s;on that none of the Mini&s;ters of the State were pre&s;ent, takes it's place in the Publication.</HI></NOTE> This is the great end of his providential government. And as he is able, &s;o he will mo&s;t certainly accompli&s;h it. He will govern all things, all nations and all occurrences in providence of eve|ry name and nature, &s;o as to conduce to the bring|ing home his people in a thorough conver&s;ion, and their final and compleat glorification.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="016019_0037_0F9B25BAB89D2A00">WE have but little encouragement from vi&s;ibility at pre&s;ent. All things outward look dark. It is a dark day on account of the unnatural war: a darker on account of the great wickedne&s;s of the country, Ala&s;s! the drun|kenne&s;s, profanity, uncleanne&s;s and Sabbath breaking through the land. O, what a lamentable decay of vital piety, family religion and government! How &s;eldom do we find any enquiring the way to Zion! The &s;pirit of conviction and conver&s;ion &s;eems apparently to have left the country almo&s;t univer&s;ally. The wi&s;e virgins are &s;lumbering and &s;leeping with the fooli&s;h. Such an impe|netrable hardne&s;s of heart prevails, that no judgments of Heaven &s;eem to make any impre&s;&s;ion on the wicked; but everyday they grow more obdurate and in&s;en&s;ible. The mo&s;t awakening, melting and alarming di&s;cour&s;es from the &s;acred de&s;k are rather derided than regarded. Surely the&s;e things are heavy on the hearts of Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters, But although Satan rages, <HI>the Lord reigns.</HI></P>
<P>AND now my brethren how are we? What &s;en&s;e have we of the&s;e things? Have we let down our watch with others? Can we content our&s;elves without the &s;pirit and energy of religion in our own &s;ouls, and to &s;ee it prevail|ing among the people? O, why are we not up in good earne&s;t? Why are we not importunate in our prayers? Pungent and pre&s;&s;ing in our applications? Unwearied in our labors night and day? Surely there is enough in Chri&s;t, enough in his &s;weet promi&s;es to encourage and &s;trengthen our faith, <HI>Lo I am with you always, even to the end of the world. I will not leave you comfortle&s;s, I will come unto you. I will pour water upon him that is thir&s;ty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my &s;pirit upon thy &s;eed, and way ble&s;&s;ing upon thine offspring.</HI> We may therefore look for great things from our Lord. And in due time we &s;hall reap if we faint not.</P>
<P>ONE thing more I would ob&s;erve, <HI>The laborers are few,</HI> very few in this infant State, and at pre&s;ent but little pro&s;|pect of many additions. Let us pray the Lord of the harve&s;t to &s;end forth laborers into his harve&s;t. And while there is &s;uch a paucity of mini&s;ters in the State, are we not called in providence, to double our labors among the people &s;cat|tered in the wilderne&s;s as &s;heep without a &s;hepherd?</P>
<P>IT is indeed &s;adly true that many appear to have but
<PB N="40" REF="016019_0038_0F9B25BB7A118638">
little regard to the mini&s;try, having imbibed gro&s;s errors and corrupt opinions, contrary to the doctrine which is according to Godline&s;s. Yet in dependance upon our great Lord and ma&s;ter, we may be in&s;trumental of winning &s;ome to Chri&s;t, and of preventing many more from follow|ing their perniciuos ways.</P>
<P>WE cannot prevent, diver&s;ity of opinions, or the gro&s;s|e&s;t errors; neit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> can the State. Our part is faithfully to deliver all the coun&s;el of God in public and in private, and to commit all to our &s;overeign Lord, in quiet re&s;ignation to his will. He governs all things civil and religion.</P>
<P>We cannot rea&s;onably de&s;ire but that every one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> joy the free liberty of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;cience.

Yea they abu&s;e both that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|vil and religious liberty; yet we &s;hould rejoice that thre is &s;uch a precious priviledge granted us. And after u&s;e|ing our be&s;t endeavours they mu&s;t be left to their own ma&s;ters, to whom they &s;tand or fall. God is the judge.</P>
<P>IT is a very plain ca&s;e that many people in the pre&s;ent day, have very ab&s;urd notions of Liberty, as if it con&s;i&s;t|ed ed in a right for every one to believe, do, or act as he plea|&s;es in all things civil, and religious. This is a <HI>Libertime</HI> principle. No man has any &s;ight, before God, to believe or practice contrary to &s;cripture. And Liberty con&s;i&s;ts in a freedom to do that which is right. The great law of nature, the moral law, is the rule of right action. This is the rule of moral and civil Liberty. Man's fall has ta|ken away his freedom of right action; for <HI>who&s;oever com|mitteth &s;in is the &s;ervant of &s;in.</HI> In the kingdom of provi|dence Chri&s;t gives a civil freedom: in the kingdom of grace he gives a &s;piritual freedom. The Go&s;pel is <HI>the perfect Law of Liberty</HI>; and this lays the foundation for a perfect moral freedom. It is the &s;piritual freedom we are e&s;pecially concerned to &s;eek among the people. And for this we &s;hould labor with the greate&s;t painfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>How &s;orrowful, that a free people, in a civil &s;en&s;e &s;hould be the &s;ervants and &s;laves of &s;in and &s;atan? O that he who was anointed to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the pri&s;on to them, that are bound would &s;peedily accompli&s;h this happy deliverance, and mo&s;t glorious freedom! Let us pray for the peace of Jeru|&s;alem. And may the ble&s;&s;ing of many that are ready to peri&s;h come upon us.</P>
