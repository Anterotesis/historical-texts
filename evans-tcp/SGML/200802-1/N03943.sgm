<P>WHEN it plea&s;ed the eternal Son of GOD to tabernacle among us, and come preaching the glad Tidings of Salvation to a fallen World, different Opinions were entertained by differ|ent Parties concerning him.&mdash;As to his Per&s;on, &s;ome &s;aid he was <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> others that he was <HI>Elias, Jeremias,</HI> or one of the ancient Prophets; few acknowledged him to be what he really was, GOD ble&s;&s;ed for ever|more.&mdash;And as to his Doctrine, tho' the common People, being free from Prejudice, were per&s;uaded of the heavenly Tendency of his going about to do Good, for the Generality heard him gladly, and &s;aid he was a good Man; yet the envious, worldly-minded, &s;elf-righteous Governors and Teachers of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church, being grieved at his Succe&s;s, on the one Hand, and unable (having never been taught of GOD) to under&s;tand the Purity of his Doctrine, on the other; notwith&s;tanding our LORD &s;pake as ne|ver

Man &s;pake, and did &s;uch Miracles which no Man could po&s;&s;ibly do, unle&s;s GOD was with him; yet they not only were &s;o infatuated, as to &s;ay, that he deceived the People, but al&s;o were &s;o bla&s;phe|mous as to affirm, that he was in league with the De|vil him&s;elf, and ca&s;t out Devils by Beelzebub the Prince of Devils.&mdash;Nay, our LORD's own Bre|thren and Kin&s;men, according to the Fle&s;h, were &s;o blinded by Prejudice and Unbelief, that on a certain Day, when he went out to teach the Multitudes in the Fields the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ent to take hold on him, urging this as a Rea&s;on for their Conduct, <ABBR>viz,</ABBR> <HI>That he was be&s;ides him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Thus was the King and Lord of Glory judged by Man's Judgment, when made manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h: Far be it from any of his Mini&s;ters to expect any better Treatment.&mdash;No, if we come in the Spirit and Power of our Ma&s;ter, in this, as in every other Part of his Sufferings, we mu&s;t follow his Steps.&mdash;The like Reproaches which were ca&s;t on him, will be thrown on us al&s;o.&mdash;Tho&s;e that received our Lord and his Doctrine, will receive and hear us for his Name-&s;ake.&mdash;The Poor, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, as our pre&s;ent Meeting abundantly te&s;tifies, receive the Go&s;pel, and the common People hear us gladly; whil&s;t tho&s;e that are &s;itting in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> his Chair, and love to wear long Robes, being ignorant of the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s which is of GOD by Faith in CHRIST JESUS, and having never felt the Power of GOD upon their Hearts, will be continually crying out again&s;t us, as Mad-men, Deceivers of the People, and as acting under the Influences of evil Spirits.</P>
<P>But he is unworthy the Name of a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel of Peace, who is unwilling, not only to have his Name ca&s;t out as evil, but al&s;o to die for the Truths of the Lord JESUS.&mdash;It is the Character
<PB N="7" REF="004861_0004_100E05FB9B06DE78">
of <HI>Hirelings</HI> and <HI>Fal&s;e Prophets,</HI> who care not for the Sheep, to have all Men &s;peak well of them.&mdash;<HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are you,</HI> &s;ays our LORD to his fir&s;t Apo&s;tles, and in them to all &s;ucceeding Mini&s;ters, <HI>when Men &s;peak all Manner of Evil again&s;t you fal&s;ely for my Name &s;ake.</HI>&mdash;And indeed it is impo&s;&s;ible but &s;uch Offences mu&s;t come: For Men will always judge of others according to the Principles from which they act them|&s;elves.&mdash;And if they care not to yield Obedience to the Doctrines which we deliver, they mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily, in Self-defence, &s;peak again&s;t the Preachers, le&s;t they &s;hould be a&s;k'd that Que&s;tion, which the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> of old feared to have retorted on them, if they confe&s;|&s;ed that <HI>John</HI> was a Prophet, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Why then did you not believe on him?</HI> In all &s;uch Ca&s;es, we have nothing to do but to &s;earch our own Hearts, and if we can a&s;|&s;ure our Con&s;ciences, before GOD, that we act with a &s;ingle Eye to his Glory, we are chearfully to go on in our Work, and not in the lea&s;t to regard what Men or Devils can &s;ay again&s;t, or do unto us.</P>
<P>But to return. You have heard what various Thoughts were handed about concerning JESUS CHRIST whil&s;t here on Earth: Nor is he other|wi&s;e treated, even now he is exalted to &s;it down at the Right Hand of his Father in Heaven.&mdash;A Stran|ger to Chri&s;tianity, was he to hear we all profe&s;s to hold one LORD, would naturally infer, that we all thought and &s;poke one and the &s;ame Thing about him. But alas! to our Shame be it mentioned, tho' CHRIST be not divided in him&s;elf, yet Profo&s;&s;ors are &s;adly divided in their Thoughts about him; and that not only as to the Circum&s;tances of his Religion, but al&s;o of tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential Truths which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be believed and received by us, if ever we hope to be Heirs of eternal Salvation.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="004861_0005_100E05FD212A8A20">
Some, and that I fear a Multitude which no Man can ea&s;ily number, there are among&s;t us, who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, and yet &s;eldom or never &s;eri|ou&s;ly think of JESUS CHRIST at all. They can think of their Shops, and their Farms, their Plays, their Balls, their A&s;&s;emblies, and Hor&s;e-races, Entertainments, which directly tend to exclude Religion out of the World (but as for CHRIST, the Author and Fini&s;her of Faith, the LORD who has bought poor Sinners with his precious Blood, and who is the only Thing worth their thinking of, alas! he is not in all, at mo&s;t in very few, of their Thoughts. But believe me, O ye earthly, &s;en&s;ual, carnally minded Profe&s;&s;ors, how|ever little you may think of CHRIST now, or how|ever indu&s;triou&s;ly you may &s;trive to keep him out of your Thoughts, by pur&s;uing the Lu&s;t of the Eye, the Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, and the Pride of Life, yet there is a Time coming, when you will wi&s;h you had thought of CHRIST more, and of your Profits and Plea&s;ures le&s;s.&mdash;For the Gay, the Polite, the Rich al&s;o mu&s;t die as well as others, and leave their Pomps, their Vanities, and all their Wealth behind them.&mdash;And oh! what Thoughts will you enter|tain concerning JESUS CHRIST, in that Hour.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not pur&s;ue the&s;e Reflections: They would carry me too far from the main De&s;ign of this Di&s;cour&s;e, which is to &s;hew what tho&s;e that are truly de&s;irous to know how to wor&s;hip GOD in Spirit and in Truth, ought to think concerning JESUS CHRIST, whom GOD hath &s;ent to be the End of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s to all them that &s;hall believe.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> you are more noble than to think me too &s;trict or &s;crupulous, in thus attempting to regulate even your Tho'ts about JESUS CHRIST: For by our Thoughts as well as our Words and Ac|tions, are we to be judged at the Great Day. And
<PB N="9" REF="004861_0006_100E05FF51A00620">
in vain do we hope to believe in, or wor&s;hip CHRIST aright, unle&s;s our Principles on which our Faith and Practice is founded, are agreeable to the Form of &s;ound Words deliver'd to us in the Scriptures of Truth.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, many Deceivers are gone abroad into the World. Mere <HI>Heathen Morality,</HI> and not JESUS CHRIST, is preached in mo&s;t of our Churches. And how &s;hould People think rightly of CHRIST, of whom they have &s;carcely heard? Do bear with me a little then, whil&s;t, to inform your Con&s;ciences, I a&s;k you a few Que&s;tions concerning JESUS CHRIST: For there is no other Name given under Heaven, whereby we can be &s;aved, but his.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t, What think you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the Per&s;on of</HI> CHRIST? <HI>Who&s;e Son is he?</HI> This is the Que&s;tion our LORD put to the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> in the Words fol|lowing the Text; and never was it more nece&s;&s;ary to repeat this Que&s;tion than in the&s;e la&s;t Days. For Numbers that are called after the Name of CHRIST, and I fear, many that pretend to preach him, are &s;o far advanced in the bla&s;phemous Chair, as openly to deny his being really, truly and properly GOD. But no one that ever was Partaker of his Spirit, will &s;peak thus lightly of him. No; if they are a&s;ked, as <HI>Peter</HI> and his Brethren were, <HI>but whom &s;ay ye that I am?</HI> they will reply without He&s;itation, <HI>Thou art</HI> CHRIST <HI>the Son of the everliving GOD.</HI> For the Confe&s;&s;ion of our Lord's Divinity, is the Rock upon which be builds his Church. Was it po&s;&s;ible to take this away, the Gates of Hell would quickly pre|vail again&s;t it.&mdash;<HI>My Brethren,</HI> if JESUS CHRIST be not very GOD of very GOD, I would never preach the Go&s;pel again. For it would not be Go&s;|pel; it would be only a Sy&s;tem of moral Ethicks: <HI>Seneca, Cicero,</HI> or any of the Gentile Philo&s;ophers would be as good a Saviour as JESUS of <HI>Nazareth.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="004861_0007_100E06017B488B50">
It is the Divinity of our LORD that gives a Sancti|on on to his Death, and makes him &s;uch a High-Prie&s;t as became us, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> One who by the infinite Merits of his Suffering could make a full, perfect, &s;ufficient Sacrifice, Satisfaction and Oblation to an infinitely offended Ju&s;tice. And whatever Mini&s;ter of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> makes u&s;e of her Forms, and eats of her Bread, and yet holds not this Doctrine (as I fear too many &s;uch are crept in among&s;t us) &s;uch a one belongs only to the <HI>Synagogue of Satan.</HI>&mdash;He is not a Child or Mini&s;ter of GOD: No; he is a Wolf in Sheep's Cloathing, he is a Child and Mini&s;ter of that Wicked One the Devil.</P>
<P>Many will think the&s;e hard Sayings: But I think it no Breach of Charity to affirm, that an <HI>Arian</HI> or <HI>Socinian</HI> cannot be a Chri&s;tian.&mdash;The one would make us believe JESUS CHRIST <HI>is only a Created God,</HI> which is a Self-Contradiction. And the other would have us look on him only as <HI>a Good Man,</HI> and in&s;tead of owning his Death to be an Atonement for the Sins of the World, would per&s;uade us, <HI>that</HI> CHRIST <HI>died only to &s;eal the Truth of his Doctrine with his Blood.</HI> But if JESUS CHRIST be no more than a mere Man, if he be not truly GOD, he was the vile&s;t Sinner that ever appeared in the World.&mdash;For he accepted of Divine Adoration from the Man who had been born blind, as we read <HI>John</HI> ix. 38. <HI>And he &s;aid, LORD I believe, and wor&s;hipped him.</HI> Be&s;ides, if CHRIST be not properly GOD, our Faith is vain, we are yet in our Sins:&mdash;For no created Being, tho' of the highe&s;t Order, could po&s;&s;ibly merit any thing at GOD's Hands: No, it was our LORD's Divinity, that alone qualified him to take away the Sins of the World; and therefore we hear St. <HI>John</HI> pronouncing &s;o po&s;itively, that <HI>the Word,</HI> i. e. JESUS CHRIST, <HI>was not only with GOD; but was GOD.</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="11" REF="004861_0008_100E0603DF0ECE40">
For the like Rea&s;on, St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>he was in the Form of GOD.</HI>&mdash;<HI>That in him dwelt all the Fulne&s;s of the Godhead bodily.</HI>&mdash;Nay, JESUS CHRIST him&s;elf a&s;&s;umes the Title which GOD gave to him&s;elf, when he &s;ent <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to deliver his People <HI>I&s;rael.

For they are greater Infidels than the Devils them&s;elves.&mdash;They confe&s;&s;ed that they knew who he was, <HI>even the holy One of GOD.</HI>&mdash;They not only believe, but which is more than the Unbelievers of this Generation do, they tremble.&mdash;And was it po&s;&s;ible for <HI>Arius</HI> or <HI>Soci|nus,</HI> tho&s;e Arch-Hereticks, to be relea&s;ed from their Chains of Darkne&s;s, under which (unle&s;s they altered their Principles before they died) they are now re&s;er|ved to the Judgment of the great Day, I am per&s;uaded they would inform us, how Hell had convinced them of the Divinity of JESUS CHRIST, and that they would advi&s;e their Followers to abhor their Princi|ples, le&s;t they &s;hould come into the &s;ame Place, and thereby increa&s;e each others Torments.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Secondly, What think you of the Manhood or Incarnation of</HI> JESUS CHRIST? For CHRIST was not only GOD, but he was GOD and Man in one Per&s;on. ....Thus runs the Text and Context. ....<HI>When the</HI> Phari&s;ees <HI>were gathered together,</HI> JESUS <HI>a&s;ked them, &s;aying, What think ye of</HI> CHRIST? <HI>Who&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="004861_0009_100E06058BBD7670">
Son is he?</HI> They &s;ay unto him, <HI>the Son of</HI> David.&mdash;<HI>How then,</HI> &s;ays our Divine Ma&s;ter, <HI>does David in Spirit call him LORD?</HI> From which Pa&s;&s;age it is evident, that we do not think rightly of the Per&s;on of JESUS CHRIST, unle&s;s we believe him to be per|fect GOD and perfect Man, of a rea&s;onable Soul and human Fle&s;h &s;ub&s;i&s;ting.</P>
<P>For it is on this Account that he is called CHRIST, or the <HI>anointed, i. e.</HI> one who through his own vo|luntary Offer was &s;et apart by the Father, &amp; &s;trength|ened and qualified by the Anointing or Communica|tion of the Holy Gho&s;t, to be a Mediator between him and offending Man.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on or fir&s;t Cau&s;e why the Son of GOD took upon him our Nature, was, the Fall of our fir&s;t Parents.&mdash;I hope there is no one pre&s;ent &s;o athe|i&s;tical, as to think that Man made him&s;elf: No, it was GOD that made us, and not we our&s;elves.&mdash;And I would willingly think, that no one would be &s;o bla&s;phemous as to &s;uppo&s;e, that if GOD did make us, he made us &s;uch Creatures as we now find our|&s;elves to be. For this would be giving GOD's Word the lie, which tells us, that <HI>in the Image of GOD,</HI> not in the Image which we now bear on our Souls, <HI>made he Man.</HI> For as GOD made Man, &s;o GOD made him perfect. He placed him in the Garden of <HI>Eden,</HI> and conde&s;cended to enter into a Covenant with him, promi&s;ing him eternal Life, upon Condition of an un&s;inning Obedience; and threatning eternal Death, if he broke his Law, and eat the forbidden Fruit.</P>
<P>Man did eat; and herein acting as our Repre|&s;entative, thereby involved both him&s;elf and us in that Cur&s;e, which GOD, the righteous Judge, had &s;aid &s;hould be the Con&s;equence of his Di&s;obedience.&mdash;But here begins that My&s;tery of Godline&s;s, GOD manife&s;ted in the Fle&s;h. For (&s;ing, O Heavens, and
<PB N="13" REF="004861_0010_100E0607C355A728">
rejoice, O Earth!) the eternal Father, fore&s;eeing how <HI>Satan</HI> would brui&s;e the Heel of Man, had in his eternal Coun&s;el, provided a Means whereby he might brui&s;e that accur&s;ed Serpent's Head. Man is permitted to fall, and become &s;ubject to Death; but JESUS the only begotten Son of GOD, begotten of the Father before all Worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, offers to die to make an Attonement for his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and to fulfil all Righteou&s;ne&s;s in his &s;tead. And becau&s;e it was im|po&s;&s;ible for him to do this as he was GOD, and yet &s;ince Man had offended, it was nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould be done in the Per&s;on of Man, rather than we &s;hould peri&s;h; this <HI>Everla&s;ting GOD,</HI> this <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> this <HI>Antient of Days,</HI> in the Fulne&s;s of Time, had a Body prepared for him by the Holy Gho&s;t, and be|came an Infant of a Span long.&mdash;In this Body he performed a compleat Obedience to the Law of GOD, whereby he, in our &s;tead, fulfilled the Cove|nant of Works, and at la&s;t became &s;ubject to Death, even the Death upon the Cro&s;s; that as GOD he might &s;atisfy, as Man he might obey and &s;uffer; and being GOD and Man in one Per&s;on, might once more procure a Union between GOD and our Souls.</P>
<P>And now, What think you of this Love of CHRIST? Do not you think it was wondrous great? E&s;pecially when you con&s;ider that we were CHRIST's bitter Enemies, and that he would have been infinitely happy in him&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding we had peri&s;hed for ever.&mdash;Whatever you may think of it, I know the ble&s;&s;ed Angels, who are not &s;o much concerned in this My&s;tery of Godline&s;s as we, think mo&s;t highly of it.&mdash;They do, they will de&s;ire to look into and admire it, thro' all Eternity.&mdash;Why, Oh why, ye Sinners, will you not think of this Love of CHRIST?&mdash;Surely it mu&s;t melt down the mo&s;t harden'd
<PB N="14" REF="004861_0011_100E0609ED4A6FC8">
Heart.&mdash;Whil&s;t I am &s;peaking, the Thoughts of this infinite and conde&s;cending Love, fires and warms my Soul.&mdash;I could dwell on it forever.&mdash;But it is expedient for you, that I &s;hould a&s;k you another Que&s;tion concerning JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, What think you about being ju&s;tified by</HI> CHRIST?&mdash;I believe I can an&s;wer for &s;ome of you.&mdash;For many, I fear, think to be ju&s;tified or looked upon as righteous in GOD's Sight, without JESUS CHRIST.&mdash;But &s;uch will find them&s;elves dreadfully mi&s;taken: For <HI>out of</HI> CHRIST <HI>GOD is a con&s;uming Fire.</HI>&mdash;Others &s;atisfy them&s;elves with believing that CHRIST was GOD and Man, and that he came into the World to &s;ave Sinners in general. Whereas their chief Thoughts ought to be, how they may be a&s;&s;u|red that JESUS CHRIST came into the World to &s;ave them in particular.&mdash;<HI>The Life that I now live in the Fle&s;h,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>is by Faith of the Son of GOD, who loved me and gave him&s;elf for me.</HI>&mdash;Ob&s;erve, <HI>for me.</HI> For it is this immediate Application of JESUS CHRIST to our own Hearts, that renders his Merits effectual to our eternal Salvation. An unapplied CHRIST will do us no Service at all.&mdash;Others there are that go &s;till further: For they think that JESUS CHRIST is GOD-MAN, that he is to be applied to their Hearts, and that they can be ju&s;tified in GOD's Sight only in or thro' him; but then they make him only in Part a Saviour.&mdash;They are for doing what they can them&s;elves, and then JESUS CHRIST is to make up the Deficiencies of their Righteou&s;ne&s;s. This is the Sum and Sub&s;tance of of our modern Divinity: And was it po&s;&s;ible for me to know the Thoughts of mo&s;t that hear me this Day, I believe they would tell me, this was the Scheme they had laid, &amp; perhaps depended on for &s;ome Years, for their eternal Salvation. Is it not then high Time
<PB N="15" REF="004861_0012_100E060C354E9758">
<HI>my Brethren,</HI> for you to entertain quite different Tho'ts concerning Ju&s;tification by JESUS CHRIST? For if you think thus, you are in the Ca&s;e of tho&s;e unhappy <HI>Jews,</HI> who went about e&s;tabli&s;hing their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and would not &s;ubmit to, and con&s;equently mi&s;&s;ed of that Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of GOD by Faith in CHRIST JESUS our LORD. What think you then, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> if I tell you, that you are to be ju&s;tified freely thro' Faith in JESUS CHRIST, without any Regard to any Work, or Fitne&s;s, fore&s;een in us, at all? For Salvation is the free Gift of GOD. I know no Fitne&s;s in Man, but a Fitne&s;s to be ca&s;t into the Lake of Fire and Brim&s;tone forever. Our Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es in GOD's Sight are but as filthy Rags. He cannot away with them. Our Holine&s;s, if we have any, is not the Cau&s;e, but the Effect of our Ju&s;tification in GOD's Sight.&mdash;We love GOD, becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us. We mu&s;t not come to GOD as the proud <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> did, bringing in as it were a Reckoning of our Ser|vices. We mu&s;t come in the Temper and Language of the poor <HI>Publican,</HI> &s;miting upon our Brea&s;ts and &s;aying, <HI>GOD be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI> For JESUS CHRIST ju&s;tifies us whil&s;t we are ungodly.&mdash;He came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repen|tance. The poor in Spirit, they who are willing to go out of them&s;elves, and rely wholly on the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of another, are only &s;o ble&s;&s;ed as to be Members of his Kingdom. The Righteou&s;ne&s;s, the whole Righteou&s;ne&s;s of JESUS CHRIST, is to be imputed to us, in&s;tead of our own. For we are not under the Law, but under Grace: And as many as walk after this Rule, Peace be on them; for they, and they only are the true <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of GOD. In the great Work of Man's Redemption, Boa&s;ting is intirely excluded; which could not be if only one of our
<PB N="16" REF="004861_0013_100E060E196392A0">

He has fulfilled all Righteou&s;ne&s;s in our &s;tead, that we might become the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of GOD in him.&mdash;All we have to do, is to lay hold on this Righteou&s;ne&s;s by Faith: And that very Moment we do apprehend it by a lively Faith, that very Moment we may be a&s;&s;ured that the Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t has clean&s;ed us from all Sin.&mdash;For the Promi&s;e is to us and to our Chil|dren, and to as many as the LORD our GOD &s;hall call. If we and our whole Hou&s;es believe, we &s;hall be &s;aved as well as the Jaylor and his Hou&s;e: For the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is an everla&s;ting as well as a perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;It is as effectual to all them that believe in him now, as formerly; and &s;o it will be, till Time &s;hall be no more.

<P>This Doctrine of our free Ju&s;tification by Faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, however cen&s;ured and evil &s;poken of by our pre&s;ent Ma&s;ters of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> was highly e&s;teemed by our wi&s;e Fore-Fathers: For in the &s;ub&s;equent Words of the fore mentioned Article, it is called <HI>a

<P>This is Go&s;pel, this is glad Tidings of great Joy to all that feel them&s;elves poor, lo&s;t and undone damned Sinners. <HI>Ho every one that thir&s;teth, come unto the Waters of Life and drink freely; come and buy without Money and without Price.</HI>&mdash;Behold a Fountain opened in your Saviour's Side, for Sin and for all Uncleanne&s;s. Look unto him whom you have pierced. Look unto him by Faith, and verily you &s;hall be &s;aved, tho' you came here only to ridicule and bla&s;pheme, and never thought of GOD or of Chri&s;t before.</P>
<P>Not that you mu&s;t think GOD will &s;ave you be|cau&s;e, or on Account of your Faith: For Faith is a Work, and then you would be ju&s;tified for your Works. But when I tell you, we are to be ju&s;tified by Faith, I mean that Faith is the In&s;trument where|by the Sinner applies or brings home the Redemp|tion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to his Heart. And to whom|&s;oever GOD gives &s;uch a Faith (for it is the free Gift of GOD) he may lift up his Head with Bold|ne&s;s, he need not fear, he is a &s;piritual Son of our &s;piritual <HI>David,</HI> he has pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life, he &s;hall never come into Condemnation.&mdash;This is the Go&s;pel which we preach. If any Man or Angel preach any other Go&s;pel, than this of our being free|ly ju&s;tified thro' Faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, we have the Authority of the greate&s;t Apo&s;tle to pronounce him accur&s;ed.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> What think you of this Fooli&s;hne&s;s of Preaching? To you that have ta&s;ted the good Word of Life, and been enlightned to &s;ee the Riches of GOD's free Grace in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, I am per&s;uaded it is precious, and has di&s;tilled

St. <HI>Paul</HI> in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> after he had in the fir&s;t five Chapters demon&s;trably proved the Doctrine of Ju&s;tification by Faith alone; in the &s;ixth, brings in an Unbeliever &s;aying, <HI>&s;hall we conti|nue in Sin then that Grace may abound?</HI> But as he rejected &s;uch an Inference with a <HI>God forbid,</HI> &s;o do I: For the Faith which we preach is not a dead &s;peculative Faith, <HI>an a&s;&s;enting to Things credible as credible,</HI> as it is commonly defined. It is not a Faith of the Head only: but a Faith of the Heart. It is a living Principle wrought in the Soul, by the Spirit of the Ever-living GOD, whereby the Sinner being convinced of his lo&s;t and undone Con|dition by Nature, is enabled to apply or lay hold on the perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s of JESUS CHRIST freely offered in the Go&s;pel, and whereby out of a Principle of Love and Gratitude, he is afterwards continually excited to abound in every good Word and Work. This is the Sum and Sub&s;tance of the Doctrine that has been delivered.&mdash;And if this be a licentious Doctrine judge ye.&mdash;No, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> this is not de&s;troying, but teaching you how to do good Works, from a proper Principle.&mdash;For to u&s;e the Words of our Church in another of her Articles, <Q>Works done before the Grace of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the In&s;piration of the Spirit, are not plea&s;ant to God, fora&s;much as they

<P>It's true, the Doctrine of our free Ju&s;tification by Faith in CHRIST JESUS, like other Go&s;pel Truths, may and will be abu&s;ed by Men of corrupt Minds, Reprobates concerning the Faith: But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">y who receive the Truth of GOD in the Love of it, will al|ways be &s;hewing their Faith by their Works. For this Rea&s;on, St. <HI>Paul</HI> after he had been telling the <HI>Ephe|&s;ians, That by Grace they were &s;aved thro' Faith, not of Works, le&s;t any Man &s;hould boa&s;t,</HI> immediately adds, <HI>For we are his Workman&s;hip, created in Chri&s;t Je&s;us nnto good Works.</HI> And in his Epi&s;tle to <HI>Titus,</HI> having given him Directions, <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. <HI>Ver.</HI> 7. to tell Peo|ple they were ju&s;tified by Grace, directly &s;ubjoins, <HI>Ver.</HI> 8. <HI>I will that you affirm con&s;tanly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good Works.</HI> Agreeable to this we are told in our 12th Article, <Q>That albeit good Works, which are the Fruits of Faith, and follow after Ju&s;tification, can|not put away our Sins, and endure the Severity of God's Judgment; yet are they plea&s;ing and accep|table to God in Chri&s;t; and do &s;pring nece&s;&s;arily out of a true and lively Faith, in&s;omuch that a lively Faith may be as evidently known by them as a Tree di&s;cerned by the Fruit.</Q></P>
<P>Oh what would I give, that this Article was duly under&s;tood and preached by all that have &s;ub&s;cribed to it! The Ark of the Lord would not then be driven into the Wilderne&s;s, nor &s;o many di&s;&s;ent from the <HI>Church of England.</HI>&mdash;For I am fully per&s;uaded, that
<PB N="20" REF="004861_0017_100E06170F62F700">
it's not &s;o much on account of Rites and Ceremonies, as our not Preaching the Truth as it is in JESUS, that &s;o many have been obliged to go and &s;eek for Food el&s;ewhere. Did not we fall from our e&s;tabli&s;h|ed Doctrines, few, comparatively &s;peaking, would fall from the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church. Where <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is preached, tho' it be in a Church or Common, Di&s;&s;en|ters of all Denominations have and do mo&s;t freely come. But if our Clergy will preach only the Law, and not &s;hew the Way of Salvation by Faith in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> the Charge of Schi&s;m at the Day of Judgment, I fear, will chiefly lie at their Door. The true Sheep of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> know the Voice of <HI>Chri&s;t'</HI>s true Shepherds, <HI>Strangers they will not hear.</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, <HI>my dear Brethren,</HI> the Words of the Ar|ticle, <HI>good Works are the Fruits of Faith, and follow after Ju&s;tification.</HI></P>
<P>How then can they precede or be any ways the Cau&s;e of it? No; our Per&s;ons mu&s;t be ju&s;tified be|fore our Performances can be accepted. God had re&s;pect to <HI>Abel</HI> before he had re&s;pect to his Offering: And therefore the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> mu&s;t be freely imputed to, and apprehended by us thro' Faith, before we can offer an acceptable Sa|crifice to God: For out of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as I hinted before, God is a con&s;uming Fire; and what&s;oever is not of Faith in Chri&s;t, is Sin.</P>
<P>People's mi&s;taking the Doctrine of free Ju&s;tifica|tion, I believe, is partly owing to their not rightly con&s;idering the different Per&s;ons St. <HI>Paul</HI> and St. <HI>James</HI> wrote to in their Epi&s;tles, as al&s;o the different Kind of Ju&s;tification each of them writes about: The former a&s;&s;erts in Line upon Line, Argument upon Argument, <HI>that we are ju&s;tified by Faith alone.</HI>&mdash;The latter puts this Que&s;tion, <HI>Was not</HI> Abraham <HI>ju&s;tified by Works?</HI> From whence many, not con&s;i|dering
<PB N="21" REF="004861_0018_100E061895193EC0">
the different Views of the&s;e Holy Men, and the different Per&s;ons they wrote to, have blended and joined Faith and Works in order to ju&s;tifie us in the Sight of God. But this is a Mi&s;take all over: For St. <HI>Paul</HI> was writing to the Jewi&s;h Pro&s;elites, who &s;ought Righteou&s;ne&s;s by the Works, not of the Ceremonial only, but of the Moral Law.&mdash;In Con|tradi&s;tinction to that, he tells them they were to look for Ju&s;tification in God's Sight, only by the perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> apprehended by Faith.&mdash;St. <HI>James</HI> had a different Set of People to deal with, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> &s;uch who abu&s;ed the Doctrines of free Ju&s;tification, and thought they &s;hould be &s;aved (as Numbers among us do now) upon their barely pro|fe&s;&s;ing to believe on <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e the holy Apo&s;tle endeavours wi&s;ely to convince, that &s;uch a Faith was only a dead and fal&s;e Faith, and therefore it behoved all who would be ble&s;&s;ed with faithful <HI>Abraham,</HI> to &s;hew forth their Faith by their Works as he did:&mdash;<HI>For was not</HI> Abraham <HI>ju&s;tified by Works,</HI> &s;ays he? <HI>i. e.</HI> Did he not prove that his Faith was a true ju&s;tifying Faith by its being productive of good Works? From whence it is plain that St. <HI>James</HI> is talking of a declarative Ju&s;tification before Men: <HI>Shew me,</HI> demon&s;trate, evidence to me, that thou ha&s;t a true Faith, by thy Works. Whereas St. <HI>Paul</HI> is talking only of our being ju&s;tified in the Sight of God; and thus he proves that <HI>Abraham,</HI> as we al&s;o are to be, was ju&s;tified before ever the Moral or Ceremonial Law was given to the Jews: For it is written, <HI>Abraham believed in the Lord, and it was ac|counted to him for Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Take the Sub&s;tance of what has been &s;aid on this Head, in the few following Words.&mdash;Every Man that is &s;aved, is ju&s;tified three Ways. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> meri|toriou&s;ly, <HI>i. e.</HI> by the Death of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> It is
<PB N="22" REF="004861_0019_100E061AC1B9D560">
the Blood of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t alone that clean&s;es us from all Sin. Secondly,</HI> in&s;trumentally, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> By Faith; Faith is the Means or In&s;trument whereby the Merits of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> are applied to the Sinner's Heart: <HI>Ye are all the Children of God by Faith in</HI> Chri&s;t Je&s;us. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> we are ju&s;tified declaratively; namely, by good Works, <HI>i. e.</HI> good Works declare and prove to the World, that our Faith is a true &s;aving Faith.&mdash;<HI>Was not</HI> Abraham <HI>ju&s;tified by Works?</HI> and Again, <HI>Shew me thy Faith by thy Works?</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>It may not be improper to illu&s;trate this Doctrine by an Example or two. I &s;uppo&s;e no one will pre|tend to &s;ay, that there was any Fitne&s;s for Salvation in <HI>Zacheus</HI> the Publican, when he came to &s;ee <HI>Je&s;us</HI> out of no better Principle, than that whereby perhaps Thou&s;ands are led to hear me preach, I mean Curi|o&s;ity; but <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> prevented and called him by his free Grace, and &s;weetly, but irre&s;i&s;tibly inclined him to obey that Call, as I pray God he may influ|ence all you that come only to &s;ee who the Preacher is. <HI>Zacheus</HI> received our Lord joyfully into his Hou&s;e, and at the &s;ame Time by Faith receiv'd him into his Heart. <HI>Zacheus</HI> was then freely ju&s;tified in the Sight of God.&mdash;But behold the immediate Fruits of that Ju&s;tification! He &s;tands forth in the Mid&s;t, and as before he had believed in his Heart, he now makes Confe&s;&s;ion with his Mouth to Salvation.&mdash;<HI>Behold, Lord, the Half of my Goods I give unto the Poor, and if I have taken any Thing from any Man by fal&s;e Accu&s;ation, I re&s;tore him Four-fold.</HI>&mdash;And thus it will be with thee, O Believer, as &s;oon as ever God's dear Son is revealed in thee by a living Faith, thou wilt have no Re&s;t in thy Spirit, till out of Love and Gra|titude for what God has done for thy Soul, thou &s;he we&s;t forth thy Faith by thy Works.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="004861_0020_100E061C4AB09280">
Again, I &s;uppo&s;e every Body will grant there was no Fitne&s;s for Salvation in the Per&s;ecutor <HI>Saul,</HI> no more than there is in tho&s;e per&s;ecuting Zealots of the&s;e la&s;t Days, who are already breathing out Threat|nings, and, if in their Power, would breath out Slaugh|ter al&s;o, again&s;t the Di&s;ciples of the LORD.</P>
<P>Now our Lord, we know, freely prevented him by his Grace (and, O that he would thus effectually call the Per&s;ecutors of this Generation) and by a Light from Heaven &s;truck him to the Ground.&mdash;At the &s;ame Time, by his Spirit, he pricked him to the Heart, convinced him of Sin, and cau&s;ed him to cry out, <HI>Who art thou, Lord?</HI> Chri&s;t replies, <HI>I am</HI> JESUS <HI>whom thou per&s;ecute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> Faith then was in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly given him, and behold, immediately <HI>Saul</HI> cries out, <HI>Lord what would&s;t thou have me to do?</HI> And &s;o will every poor Soul that believes on the Lord <HI>Je&s;us</HI> with his whole Heart. He will be al|ways a&s;king, <HI>Lord what &s;hall I do for thee? Lord what would&s;t thou have me to do?</HI> Not to ju&s;tify him|&s;elf, but only to evidence the Sincerity of his Love and Thankfulne&s;s to his all-merciful High-Prie&s;t, for plucking him as a Firebrand out of the Fire.</P>
<P>Perhaps, many Self-righteous Per&s;ons among&s;t you, may flatter your&s;elves, that you are not &s;o wicked as either <HI>Zacheus</HI> or <HI>Saul</HI> was, and con&s;equently there is a greater Fitne&s;s for Salvation in you than in them. But if you think thus, indeed you think more highly of your&s;elves than you ought to think: For by Na|ture we are all alike, all equally fallen &s;hort of the Glory of God, all equally dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins, and there needs the &s;ame Almighty Power to be exerted in converting any one of the mo&s;t &s;ober, good natured Moral Per&s;ons here pre&s;ent, as there was in converting the Publican <HI>Zacheus,</HI> or that no|torious Per&s;ecutor <HI>Saul.</HI>&mdash;And was it po&s;&s;ible for you

<P>As I ob&s;erved before, &s;o I tell you again, the Faith which we preach is not a dead, but a lively active Faith wrought in the Soul and working a thorough Change, by the Power of the Holy Gho&s;t, in the whole Man&mdash;And unle&s;s CHRIST be thus in you, not|with&s;tanding you may be orthodox as to the forego|ing Principles, notwith&s;tanding you may have good De&s;ires, and attend con&s;tantly on the Means of Grace; yet, in St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s Opinion, you are out of a State of Salvation. <HI>Know you not,</HI> &s;ays that Apo&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> a Church famous for its Gifts above any Church under Heaven, <HI>that</HI> CHRIST <HI>is in you,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> by his Spirit, <HI>unle&s;s you are Reprobates?</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> came not only to &s;ave us from the Guilt, but the Power of our Sins: Till he has done this, however he may be a Saviour to others, we can have no A&s;&s;urance, or well-grounded Hope, that he has &s;aved us: For it is by receiving his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit into our Hearts, and feeling him witne&s;&s;ing with

our Spirits, that we are the Sons of God, that we can be certified of our being &s;ealed to the Day of Redemption.</P>
<P>This is a great My&s;tery, but I &s;peak of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and the <HI>New Birth.</HI>&mdash;Marvel not at my a&s;king you, what you think about <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> being formed within you?

None but tho&s;e that thus are changed by his Grace here, &s;hall appear with him in Glory hereafter.</P>
<P>Examine your&s;elves therefore, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> whe|ther you are in the Faith; prove your&s;elves; &amp; think it not &s;ufficient to &s;ay in your Creed, <HI>I believe in Je|&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> For you do not believe, you are Liars, you are Reprobates, you are yet in a State of Death.

Remember then, that at &s;uch an Hour, of &s;uch a Day, in &s;uch a Year, in this Place, you were all told what you ought to think concerning <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash;If you now peri&s;h, it will not be for lack of Knowledge.&mdash;I am free from the Blood of you all.&mdash;You cannot &s;ay I have been preaching Damnation to you.&mdash;You can|not &s;ay I have, like legal Preachers, been requiring you to make Brick without Straw. I have not bid you make your&s;elves Saints, and then come to God.&mdash;But I have offer'd you Salvation on as cheap Terms as you can de&s;ire.&mdash;I have offered you <HI>Chri&s;t'</HI>s whole Wi&s;dom, <HI>Chri&s;t'</HI>s whole Righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Chri&s;t'</HI>s whole Sanctification and Eternal Redemption, if you will but believe on him.&mdash;If you &s;ay you cannot believe, you &s;ay right; for Faith as well as every other Ble&s;|&s;ing is the Gift of God: But then wait upon God and who knows but he may have Mercy on thee. Why do we not entertain more loving Thoughts of CHRIST? Or do you think he will have Mercy on o|thers, and not on you? But are you not Sinners? And did not JESUS CHRIST come into the World to &s;ave Sinners?&mdash;If you &s;ay you are the chief of Sinners; I

an&s;wer, that will be no Hindrance to your Salvation, indeed it will not, if you lay hold on him by Faith. Read the Evangeli&s;ts, and &s;ee how kindly he behaved to his Di&s;ciples who fled from and denied him. <HI>Go tell my Brethren,</HI> &s;ays he.&mdash;He does not &s;ay, Go tell tho&s;e Traitors; but, Go tell my <HI>Brethren; And Peter;</HI> as tho' he had &s;aid, <Q>go tell my Brethren in general, and poor <HI>Peter</HI> in particular, <HI>that I am ri&s;en.</HI> Oh, comfort his poor drooping Heart, tell him I am reconciled to him. Bid him weep no more &s;o bitterly. For though with Oaths and Cur&s;es he has thrice deny'd me, yet I have died for his Sins, I am ri&s;en again for his Ju&s;tifi|cation, I freely forgive him all.</Q>&mdash;Thus &s;low to Anger, and of great Kindne&s;s, was our all-merciful High-Prie&s;t. And do you think he has changed his Nature, and forgets poor Sinners now he is exalted to the Right-Hand of God? No, he is the &s;ame Ye|&s;terday, to Day and forever, and &s;itteth there only to make Interce&s;&s;ion for us. ..... Come then, ye Har|lots, come ye Publicans, come ye mo&s;t abandoned Sinners, come and believe on <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Tho' the whole World de&s;pi&s;e you and ca&s;t you out, yet he will not di&s;dain to take you up. Oh! amazing, Oh! infinitely conde&s;cending Love, even you he will not be a&s;hamed to call his Brethren. And Oh! how will you e&s;cape if you neglect &s;uch a glorious Offer of Salvation? What would the damned Spirits now in the Pri&s;on of Hell give, if <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was &s;o freely offered to their Souls? And why are not we lifting up our Eyes in Torment? Does any one out this great Multitude dare &s;ay, he does not de&s;erve Damnation? If not, why are we left and others taken away by Death? What is this but an In&s;tance of God's free Grace, and a Sign of his good Will towards us? Oh then, let God's Goodne&s;s lead us to Repentance!

Oh let there be Joy in Heaven over &s;ome of you repenting! Tho' we are in a Field, I am per&s;uaded the ble&s;&s;ed Angels are hovering now around us, and long, <HI>as the Hart panteth after the Water Brooks,</HI> to &s;ing an Anthem at your Conver&s;ion. Ble&s;&s;ed be God I hope their Joy will be fulfilled. An awful Silence appears among&s;t us. I have good Hope that the Words that the Lord has enabled me to &s;peak in your Ears this Day, have not altogether fallen to the Ground. Your Tears and deep Attention are an Evidence, that the Lord God is among&s;t us of a Truth. Come ye <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> come and &s;ee, in &s;pight of your Satanical Rage and Fury, the Lord JESUS is getting him&s;elf the Victory. And Brethren, I &s;peak the Truth in CHRIST, I lie not, if one Soul of you, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, be brought to think &s;avingly of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> this Day, I care not if my Enemies were permitted to carry me to Pri&s;on and put my Feet fa&s;t in the Stocks, as &s;oon as I have deliver'd this Sermon. Brethren, my Heart's De&s;ire and Prayer to God is, that you may be &s;aved. For this Cau&s;e I follow my Ma&s;ter without the Camp. I care not how much of his &s;acred Reproach I bear, &s;o that &s;ome of you be converted from the Error of your Ways. I rejoice, yea and I will rejoice. Ye Men, ye Devils do your wor&s;t. The LORD who &s;ent will &s;upport me. And when CHRIST, who is our Life, and whom I have now been preaching, &s;hall appear, I al&s;o, together with his de&s;pi&s;ed little Ones, &s;hall appear with him in Glory.&mdash;And then, what will you think of CHRIST?&mdash;I know what you will think of him. You will then think him to be <HI>the Faire&s;t among ten Thou&s;and.</HI> You will then think and <HI>feel</HI> him to be a ju&s;t and Sin-avenging Judge. Oh then be ye per&s;uaded to ki&s;s him le&s;t he be angry, and &s;o you be bani&s;hed forever from the Pre&s;ence of the Lord. Behold I

come to you, as the Angel did to <HI>Lot.</HI> My dear <HI>Brethren,</HI> flee, flee for your Lives, ha&s;te, linger no longer in your &s;piritual <HI>Sodom;</HI> for otherwi&s;e you will be eternally de&s;troyed. Numbers, no Doubt, there are among&s;t you, that may regard me no more than <HI>Lot'</HI>s Sons-in-law regarded him. I am per&s;uaded I &s;eem to &s;ome of you as one that mocks.&mdash;But I &s;peak the Truth in CHRIST, I lie not, as &s;ure as Fire and Brim&s;tone rained from the Lord out of Heaven, to de&s;troy <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> &s;o &s;urely at the great Day &s;hall the Vials of God's Wrath be pour|ed on you, if you do not think &s;eriou&s;ly of and act a|greeable to the Go&s;pel of the Lord's CHRIST. Be|hold I have told you before,&mdash;I pray GOD, all you that forget him may &s;eriou&s;ly think of what has been &s;aid, before he pluck you away and there be none to deliver you.</P>
