<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Pieces were written &s;ome Months ago, but the Publi&s;hing of them defer'd on Account of the frequent Prorogations of the A&s;&s;embly, under who&s;e Con&s;ideration they were chiefly meant to fall. The Pro&s;e Part &s;ufficiently explains its De&s;ign; but, to &s;ome, the Ver&s;es may &s;eem a needle&s;s Addition.</P>
<P>The Author replies, that con&s;idering how long it has been &s;adly neglected in this Province to give due Attention to the Concerns of Literature and Education, he thought it would be &s;topping far &s;hort, if he laid down Propo&s;als for this Purpo&s;e, without endea|vouring at the &s;ame Time to excite his Countrymen to a &s;peedy Execution of them. The mo&s;t pathetic Manner of doing this, he judg'd, was by a Repre&s;entation of the happy State we might arrive to, upon the Suppo&s;ition of our attending to our true Intere&s;ts at pre&s;ent. Now, as a Pro&s;pect without &s;ome Variety and Colour|ing can't take the Eye; and as the anticipating di&s;tant glorious Scenes naturally warms the Fancy, di&s;tends the Soul, and raps it into the Enthu&s;ia&s;m of <HI>Poetry;</HI> he hopes, 'twere needle&s;s to trouble Gentlemen of Ta&s;te with any other Apology, for his Choice of this Species of Writing.</P>
<P>The Thought upon which the Poem chiefly turns, tho' a plain Maxim in Politics, will perhaps &s;tartle &s;ome narrow Minds; but the found Politician will no more be &s;urpriz'd at it, than the learn'd Phy&s;ician, if told that his Patient of 50 cannot live 50 Years more. Our Writers at Home &s;peak without Re&s;erve of the Death of the Briti&s;h Monarchy. Thus the amiable <HI>Prior:</HI>

<L>Long &s;hall <HI>Britannia'</HI>s MONARCHY engage</L>
<L>The Teeth of Envy and the Force of Age:</L>
<L>Rever'd and happy, long &s;hall &s;he remain,</L>
<L>Of human Things, lea&s;t changeable and vain.</L>
<L>Yet all mu&s;t with the general Doom comply,</L>
<L>And this great glorious Power, tho' la&s;t, mu&s;t die.</L></Q>
The Poet means la&s;t of all the Empires of the Ea&s;tern World; for a little above he makes <HI>Solomon,</HI> in who&s;e Mouth he puts the&s;e Words, declare that <HI>America</HI> was then folded from human Eye: and this agrees exactly with our Hypothe&s;is. One Author has even pretended to &s;hew how long the <HI>Briti&s;h Con&s;titution</HI> can &s;ub&s;i&s;t; but this being one of the ARCANA of Heaven, &s;uch Speculations are idly curious. Another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume'<HI>s Moral E&s;&s;ays.</HI> No 9.</NOTE> has enquired whether a <HI>Republic</HI> or <HI>ab&s;olute Monarchy</HI> would be its ea&s;ie&s;t Death, its true EUTHANASIA; and, by a Piece of beautiful Rea&s;oning, &s;hewn that the latter, which in all Probability will be its Fate, is much rather to be wi&s;h'd for.

<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Conclu&s;ion of Dr.</HI> Young'<HI>s Night-Thoughts.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Virtue and Vice are Empire's Life and Death.</HI></Q>
And, as <HI>Machiavel</HI> ob&s;erves, 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to maintain a free Government among a corrupt People; for tho&s;e good Laws, tho&s;e fa&s;t Patriots, who are the <HI>Pillars of Liberty</HI> among a <HI>virtuous People,</HI> become de&s;tructive of it when their Genius is grown cor|rupt: Thus the rigid Stiffne&s;s of <HI>Cato,</HI> in&s;tead of pre&s;erving the <HI>Freedom,</HI> ha&s;tened the <HI>Slavery</HI> of the <HI>Romans;</HI> for he knew not to make the lea&s;t Allowance for a crazy Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>That great Politician and Ma&s;ter of all polite Learning, Lord <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> thinks that Nothing can give a &s;aving Turn to the ru&s;hing <HI>Briti&s;h Genius,</HI> but &s;ome extraordinary Conjuncture of ill Fortune or of good; which may purge, yet &s;o as by Fire.&mdash;True, to &s;uch Purgings and Convul&s;ions it is, that <HI>Britain</HI> owes her pre&s;ent Freedom and Grandeur; but then they happened in other Times,
<Q><L><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thomp&s;on'<HI>s Liberty.</HI></NOTE> <HI>When more than Roman Senates met and blew</HI></L>
<L><HI>A Flame that clear'd, con&s;um'd, renew'd the Land:</HI></L></Q>
They happened in the Reign of weak Princes, when there were brave Patriots who knew how to improve tho&s;e lucky Occa&s;ions, by obliging the Kings to give back whatever had been illegally u&s;urp'd from the People, and by drawing back the Government to its fundamental good Principles; in &s;hort they happened when the Con&s;titution was able to bear them:&mdash;but &s;hould it happen that ever an ambitious enterprizing Prince fills the Throne,&mdash;one that is wicked and crafty enough to take the Advantage of the vi&s;ible

Decay of the ancient Engli&s;h Spirit, it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee that the Scales mu&s;t be turn'd, and I tremble even to think of the Con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>But here it will be a&s;k'd, why alarm us with Dangers &s;o &s;eemingly di&s;tant?&mdash;For this very Rea&s;on, becau&s;e it is di&s;tant; was the Danger near, Alarms would be in vain. Have Patience I will explain my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Analogy of Rea&s;oning, which &s;hews us that all Governments are &s;ubject to Death, &s;hews al&s;o that the&s;e Provinces may &s;urvive their Mother Country:&mdash;Here again, methinks, I hear the &s;ame Cry as again&s;t every other Effort to improve the Spirit of <HI>Liberty and Virtue;</HI>&mdash;what &s;hake off our Allegiance and become independent? No: I'm far from thinking it will ever be our Intere&s;t, or in our Power, to be independent of <HI>Britain,</HI> while &s;he is able to maintain her own Independency; but &s;hould &s;he ever fall into the Way of other Nations, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that we, like the chief Favourites of Ea&s;ter.. Tyrants, would contentedly &s;uffer our&s;elves to be laid in the &s;ame Grave with her; this is a Te&s;t of Affection which &s;he will never require, and which, I hope, but a few here wou'd be di&s;pos'd to give. Indeed, &s;o far from being in a Condition to &s;hake off our Dependency, in my &s;incere Judgment, we cou'd not at pre&s;ent even &s;ub&s;i&s;t in an independant State.&mdash;We are as deeply immer&s;ed in Luxury as our Mother Country, little reflecting that the Food of Men is not Meat for Babes; &s;o that were &s;he to fall at pre&s;ent, we mu&s;t inevitably fall with her. But, Thanks be to Heaven, we &s;eem &s;ecure in a long Succe&s;&s;ion of Princes, who&s;e Family have ever reckon'd it their greate&s;t Glory to be the Patrons of Freedom, and to &s;ave a degenerate World from univer&s;al Slavery even again&s;t their Will.&mdash;We &s;hould then be greatly cautious to make a proper U&s;e of tho&s;e golden Moments, which will not always la&s;t. If we do &s;o, then whenever a <HI>gallic,</HI> or <HI>home-born Tyrant</HI> &s;hall ari&s;e (and &s;ooner or later &s;uch will ari&s;e) threatning to lay <HI>Britain,</HI> the Belov'd of Heaven, the Pride of Earth, the I&s;le of Heroes and Freedom, in the Du&s;t, if our A&s;&s;i&s;tance can't avert the Blow from her, we &s;hall at lea&s;t be able, at this Di&s;tance, to avert it from our&s;elves, and open an A&s;ylum to the noble Gleanings of her brave Sons who &s;purn the Yoke&punc;&mdash;But if we neglect this fa|vourable Opportunity of purging the Fountain, by making a la&s;ting Provi&s;ion for educating a Succe&s;&s;ion of true Patriots and Citizens, it may &s;oon be too late; and tho' there was no Danger of being &s;urprized in this State of Indolence, we our&s;elves will &s;oon be in no Capacity even to think of a Reformation of Manners; for let us remember, that if once Corruption&punc; which treads clo&s;e on the Heels of Luxury, gets Footing among&s;t us, all the Art of Man cannot, and Heaven will not, <HI>&s;ave us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="006935_0007_102A9B84C68B3390">
To illu&s;trate, and make the proper U&s;e of the&s;e Thoughts, is the De&s;ign of the following Poem; which I thought nece&s;&s;ary to explain thus at large, that &s;o there may be no Room left for a &s;ini&s;ter Con&s;truction. I hope the Rea&s;oning will be found con|nected; and the Principles upon which it is built I have partly ju&s;tified by the be&s;t Authorities. As there is a large Field open, I might have given ample Range to Fancy: I might al&s;o have rais'd the Diction in &s;everal Places; but all my De&s;ign was to communicate briefly a few important Truths, &s;o as readily to &s;trike an ordinary Reader.&mdash;As I have a greater Ambition to be thought a good <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> than a good Writer; I hope, far from harboring the lea&s;t unfavourable Thought of my native Country&punc; I have &s;hewn a laudable Partiality to it; and indeed the &s;tronger this Partiality is, the &s;tronger too will be the Apprehen&s;ion of every Danger wherewith &s;he may be affected: I wou'd fondly believe the Period of her Fall is yet very remote; but while it remains uncertain, all my Arguments will be conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>As I addre&s;s to the A&s;&s;embly, a particular Addre&s;s to Mr. JONES is but a ju&s;t Compliment to their late prudent Choice of a Speaker, tho' other Circum&s;tances did not challenge it; and, having once mentioned Him&punc; I could not forbear adding a few Lines to encourage him to continue &s;tedfa&s;t in the good Cau&s;e he has engag'd in: For I have &s;een Him, and Him alone by Name, treated in a very ungenteel and ungenerous Manner in &s;everal Pamphlets, and that for nothing el&s;e but his &s;uperior Zeal to pre&s;erve a ju&s;t Balance between the Branches of the Legi&s;lature, and to pre&s;erve the ju&s;t Privilege of A&s;&s;emblies. A Man, le&s;s a PATRIOT than he, would &s;corn to throw away his Labors in Return for &s;o much Ingratitude; but, <HI>contra audentior ibat,</HI> he has e&s;teem'd it mean and inglorious to exchange a Scene of great and generous Efforts in public Life for private Ea&s;e or Intere&s;t; and therefore it &s;hould be the Part of every hone&s;t Man, to encourage and &s;upport him in this laudable Re&s;olution; and not only him, but &s;everal other worthy Gentlemen of the A&s;&s;embly, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;who, having &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves, in the Wor&s;t of Times, by their &s;teady Attachment to their Country's Intere&s;t, have been as unworthily us'd as he: To all &s;uch I wou'd be under&s;tood to apply what I have &s;aid on <HI>Patrioti&s;m,</HI> tho' I have not thought my &s;elf at Liberty to name them, &s;ince I have never &s;een them attack'd under their proper Names&punc;</P>
<P>A Difference between the Branches of the Legi&s;lature is a natural Con&s;equence of <HI>Liberty:</HI> All Men are fond of Power; and, where the Di&s;pute is handled with Good-Manners, Temper and Benevo|lence, it gives me Plea&s;ure to hear the mini&s;terial Party accu&s;e the People of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s; and the People, in their Turn, accu&s;
<PB N="ix" REF="006935_0008_102A9B8862F14060">
their Governors of &s;tretching the Prerogative beyond due Bounds; this is a certain Indication that neither Side &s;peaks wholly true that the Balance has ju&s;t Play, and <HI>Liberty</HI> is in no Danger. But when I hear the Writers of either Side, running into Scurrility and per&s;onal Satyr, and creating Ill-Blood among Fellow-Citizens, for what mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily happen in this State of Imperfection, where Men by their very Differences and Weakne&s;&s;es, are accommodated to one another and link'd together, it rai&s;es my Indignation to the highe&s;t Pitch, and I look upon &s;uch Scriblers as the <HI>Bane of Society, and only fit for a Halter.</HI></P>
<P>But I will conclude, having proceeded far enough on this Sub|ject, perhaps, to draw Ill-Will on my &s;elf: For as Doctor <HI>Swift</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, One will get more Ill-Will by being the Author of a particular Encomium, than of a general Invective; but, if the Doctor's Rea&s;on for this, is not it&s;elf, a Satyr on human Nature, I apprehend none from any Gentleman that has the Honor of a Seat in the A&s;&s;embly: And, far from regarding the Cen&s;ure, I &s;hould think my&s;elf reproach'd by the Applau&s;e of tho&s;e who prai&s;e or blame as Intere&s;t directs. I feel a very different Satisfaction, in bearing Te&s;timony to Truth, from what they mu&s;t feel, who never had the Goodne&s;s of Heart and hone&s;t Impartiality to com|mend <HI>Worth,</HI> nor Wit enough to vent their mercenary Spleen again&s;t it without per&s;onal Abu&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the&s;e Papers, they are entirely &s;ubmitted to the Candor and Judgment of the Public; to which I &s;hould pay but a &s;orry Com|pliment, if I did not declare, that I have done all in my Power, to make them in &s;ome Sort worthy of the Subject. Faults&punc; however, they mu&s;t have; but, Partiality being none of them, I hope they will be look'd upon as the real Sentiments of a Heart that &s;corns to entertain a Thought repugnant to what appears our general Good: There is not perhaps, any one Per&s;on in this Province more detach'd than I am, from the different Parties that have &s;o long divided it; Intere&s;t, Health and Inclination, concur to call me from it quickly, but if the&s;e Papers can any Way an&s;wer the good Intent of Writing them, I &s;hall think, I have not &s;een it altogether in Vain: And tho' Providence may &s;oon place me at too great a Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ance to be of any further U&s;e, either by advi&s;ing, exhorting, or warning, yet can I never be plac'd, where it &s;hall not be my con&s;tant Prayer, that it may be happy, and flori&s;h more and more.&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON EDUCATION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_IF we look into the Story of the mo&s;t renown'd States and Kingdoms, that have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the different Ages of the World, we will find that they were indebted for their Ri&s;e, Grandeur, and Happine&s;s, to the early Provi&s;ion made by their fir&s;t Founders, for the public In&s;titution of Youth.</P>
<P>The great Sages and Legi&s;lators of Antiquity, were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this, that they always made it their prime Care to plant Seminaries, and regulate the Method of <HI>Education;</HI> and many of them even deign'd, in Per|&s;on, to be the immediate Superintendants of the Man|ners of Youth, whom they ju&s;tly reckoned the ri&s;ing Hopes of their Country.</P>
<P><HI>Numa,</HI> is the only great Lawgiver, we read of, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> was faulty in this Re&s;pect; and to this capital Erro of his, in the Foundation of the <HI>Roman</HI> State, has been a&s;cribed, that turbulent and &s;editious Spirit of the People, which all their future Worthies cou'd never thoro'ly tame; and which, in the End, occa&s;ioned the Downfal of that mighty Empire.&mdash;Of this Opinion was <HI>Plutarch,</HI> who, comparing him with <HI>Lycurgus,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="006935_0010_102A9B8E13863310">
&s;ays, that no &s;ooner was the Breath out of <HI>Numa'</HI>s Body, than the whole Aim of his Life and Govern|ment was revers'd; the Temple of <HI>Janus</HI> was thrown open, and <HI>Italy</HI> became one Scene of Havoc and De|&s;olation; &s;o that the fine&s;t and ju&s;te&s;t Con&s;titution in the World could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, even the &s;malle&s;t Moment, becau&s;e it wanted that Cement in it, which &s;hould have kept all firm together; namely, <HI>good Rules for the Education of Youth.</HI> However this be, certain it is, that tho&s;e Societies, who&s;e fir&s;t Lawgivers included Education in the Idea of Government, and thought it the Ba&s;is and very Soul of their Work, to contrive good Laws or Plans for this Purpo&s;e, always grew up quicke&s;t, and flouri&s;hed longe&s;t in a State of <HI>Liberty</HI> and glorious <HI>Independency.</HI></P>
<P>Hence I have often wondered, that this Province &s;hould have been near a whole Century, in the Hands of a civilized and enlightned People; and yet, not one public Seminary of Learning planted in it; where the Ta&s;te and Manners of our Youth may be formed; where they may be taught (<HI>quid Verum atque Decus</HI>) the Knowledge and Practice of <HI>Virtue;</HI> and where, without being beholden to our Neighbours, the fir&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Advances may be made, towards the rendering them hone&s;t, virtuous, and &s;ocial Creatures. We are the more inexcu&s;able, becau&s;e, in this Infancy of our Province, we are not condemned to grope our Way in the Dark, as tho&s;e Heathens were, but have the Experience of all Mankind for our Guide, and the Advantage of &s;eeing by what Steps others have toil'd, &s;lowly to the Summit of GLORY and EMPIRE; and therefore cannot be ignorant, that Foundations of this Kind are of the la&s;t Con&s;equence, to the Being and Well being of SOCIETY.</P>
<P>Surely we are not inferior to our Neighbours in good Sen&s;e, and the Refinements of civil Life, and &s;uperior to many of them in Situation, Trade and Riches; yet

&s;o it is, that they have long got the Start of us in &s;everal laudable and public &s;pirited Undertakings, par|ticularly, in this the mo&s;t intere&s;ting of all.</P>

As &s;uch Thoughts as the&s;e have often occurr'd to me, it gives me Plea&s;ure to under&s;tand that the Founding a College in this Province, begins now to be &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider'd; and as this great Work &s;eems chiefly re|tarded, by the Difficulty of agreeing on a proper Place for fixing it, I beg leave to &s;ubmit my impartial Thoughts on this Head, to the Con&s;ideration of the Public.&mdash;</P>
<P>As to the Situation then, I can't help being &s;urpris'd to hear it di&s;puted; &s;ome retir'd Corner, either within, or clo&s;e by the City of <HI>New-York,</HI> being certainly the only proper Place in this Province for erecting a College.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="006935_0012_102A9B9238983090">
There is (and I think can be) but the following Ob|jection again&s;t this Situation, <HI>viz.</HI> That here the <HI>Morals</HI> of the Scholars, will not be &s;o &s;afe as in the Country; and that there will be too many Amu&s;ements to divert them from their Studies.</P>
<P>Now near One-half of the Scholars, which, at fir&s;t, will be young Gentlemen of the City of <HI>New York</HI> it&s;elf, are no Way affected by this Objection; &s;ince, if there is any Force in it, it wou'd be equally an Argument again&s;t their learning Grammar, or &s;pending any Part of their Youth in their native City. I &s;hall then turn my Thoughts wholly to the other Half, which will be young Gentlemen from the Country; and if I can &s;hew their Parents, that <HI>New-York</HI> is no more affected by this Objection than any other Place they can fix on, I can ea&s;ily &s;uperadd &s;uch Arguments as will induce them to prefer this Situation to all others.</P>
<P>They admit, that the Conver&s;ation of poli&s;h'd Citizens, would be of great Advantage to their Sons; but, &s;ay they, in &s;uch a large Place, there never fails to be worthle&s;s raki&s;h Per&s;ons, to debauch unwary Youth, and lead them into what (to oblige delicate Ears) is call'd the polite Vices: And therefore,
<Q><HI>If Knowledge of the World mu&s;t taint Men's Morals,</HI>
&mdash;<HI>may our Sons ever live in Ignorance!</HI>&mdash;</Q></P>
<P>Before I proceed to an&s;wer this Objection, I might ob&s;erve that it is wholly grounded on fal&s;e Suppo&s;itions: For it is not true, that Youth wou'd never learn Vice without &s;eeing it, e&s;pecially the Vices here meant, which ari&s;e from the irregular Exerci&s;e of our be&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t natural Pa&s;&s;ions, I mean the Social: No more is it true that they will always learn Vice by &s;eeing it; on the Contrary, as <HI>Plato</HI> imagined the Vi&s;ion of Virtue (if pure Virtue could be &s;een) would render all Men virtu|ous; &s;o, perhaps the Vi&s;ion of Vice, in all its odious Colors, is the &s;tronge&s;t Pre&s;ervative again&s;t Vice. However, I don't &s;ay, with &s;ome, that it would be
<PB N="5" REF="006935_0013_102A9B95AB0F02A0">
prudent to lead Youth into unnece&s;&s;ary Temptation, and &s;hew them Evil in order to make them Good; nor do I deny, that to pre&s;erve the Morals found, ought to be the chief Aim of Education; but
<Q><L><HI>As Heaven's high Will has fixt us in a State</HI></L>
<L><HI>That mu&s;t not yet to pure</HI> PERFECTION <HI>ri&s;e;</HI></L></Q>
And in a State where Evil, being permitted, is con|&s;tantly blended with Good, we cannot &s;hew them the One without the Other, if we would ever have them behold an original Character, or aught that is real in Life; &s;o that were the Force of this Objection once admitted, it will conclude equally again&s;t collegiate Education at <HI>New-York</HI> and all Places; and Nothing will be left for tho&s;e who adhere to it, but to &s;hut their Sons up in Cloi&s;ters to be entertain'd apart from So|ciety, with the Dreams of Vi&s;ionaries, and the imagi|nary Virtues of Utopian Characters: There they mu&s;t &s;leep away their whole Lives, without daring to act, le&s;t they act, wrong, or look into the World, le&s;t they &s;ee Evil, which is the &s;ame as if one &s;hould die of the Fear of Death&punc;&mdash;Nay, by this Rule, they mu&s;t never know them&s;elves, or look into their own Hearts, be|cau&s;e there they would &s;ee a Medley of Good and Evil, or the WORLD in Miniature; and I believe no one would give the Name of Virtue to the mechanical, or rather negative Goodne&s;s of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ive Creatures, as may well be &s;aid never to have exi&s;ted or awak'd into Life, &s;ince they deny them&s;elves all Opportunity of Choice, or of exerting the Freedom of their Nature, which is their Dignity, and the noble&s;t Gift of GOD; and refu&s;e to act in Society, becau&s;e <HI>Plato'</HI>s Republic and <HI>More'</HI>s Utopia have no real Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>But as I know the Gentlemen, who make this Ob|jection, intend their Sons for Society; and only make it from a very laudable Concern for their Morals; I &s;hall not pu&s;h its Con&s;equences farther, but return to the main Point, and endeavour to convince them that
<PB N="6" REF="006935_0014_102A9B9822DFE6F8">
<HI>New-York</HI> is, perhaps, the &s;afe&s;t Place in this Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, Nothing is ea&s;ier than to prevent the Scholars from a&s;&s;ociating with any idle Per&s;ons, that do not belong to their College, by proper Regulations, and laying the Plan of it, &s;o as they may all lodge with|in its Walls: It is &s;eldom they &s;hew any Inclination to this; and every One knows that, in the large&s;t Cities, the Danger complain'd of never ari&s;es from this, but from Clubs or A&s;&s;ociations among the Scholars them|&s;elves, which are always more extravagant in a pitiful Village, than in a large and well governed City.</P>
<P>As upon the Truth of this &s;eeming Parodox, depends the whole Di&s;pute; I beg Leave to appeal to incon|te&s;table Facts and Experience, which is the be&s;t Way of clearing up a Truth of this Nature.</P>
<P>I a&s;k any One that knows <HI>England,</HI> whether the Scholars are not far more extravagant and debauched at the Academies in the &s;mall Towns there, than at the public Univer&s;ities of <HI>Oxford</HI> or <HI>Cambridge?</HI>&mdash;And, indeed the Rea&s;on is obvious: Nature is the &s;ame, in the &s;ame Per&s;ons, every where;&mdash;at <HI>Oxford, &amp;c.</HI> the Scholars are under the Eye of the public Magi&s;trate, and a great many Gentlemen who&s;e Characters they re|vere; &s;o that if they are not le&s;s vicious, they are at lea&s;t more prudent in managing all their Intrigues, &s;o as to give no public Offence, and in keeping within the Bounds of Decorum and good Manners in all their Clubs and Frolics: But, at the Village-Academies, the Scholars, with equal Propen&s;ities to Vice, are not under equal Re&s;traints; they only &s;ee a few illiterate Artificers, whom they &s;oon learn to look upon as ta&s;tele&s;s unpoli&s;h'd Clowns, and who&s;e Cen&s;ure they wholly di&s;regard: And thus being uncontrol'd, either by Shame or the Authority of the civil Power, they &s;ometimes run into the wilde&s;t Riots, in the Face of Day, and in Defiance of the whole Village, of which they are &s;o far Ma&s;ters that none dare re&s;i&s;t, or prefer
<PB N="7" REF="006935_0015_102A9B99C556C2A0">
a Complaint again&s;t them. Add to this, that, in &s;uch &s;orry Places, they contract a De&s;ire for mean Company, and a Ta&s;te for low Vices, which ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hes them from People of a genteel Education, all their Lives.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the Temptations are fewer in a Village than in a City, however &s;pacious, is &s;aying no more to the Purpo&s;e, than that a Man (if the Compari&s;on may be allow'd) &s;hould rather quench his Thir&s;t in a Brook than a River, when there is more than enough in either; for wherever there are Purcha&s;ers, there will be found Venders or Di&s;po&s;ers.&mdash;</P>
<P>To &s;ay that in the di&s;tant Village, there will be no Fellow-Rakes to lead them into Vice, is al&s;o &s;aying Nothing: For if we could &s;uppo&s;e the Country Youth, when fir&s;t admitted to the College, &s;o entirely unpol|luted, and of a Make &s;o frigid and pa&s;&s;ionle&s;s, as never to think of Vice without being driven into it; (which, as I ob&s;erv'd above, is a very groundle&s;s Suppo&s;ition;) yet there will be the other Half of the Scholars from <HI>New-York,</HI> to be their Ma&s;ters in this, whom the Country Gentlemen cannot &s;uppo&s;e &s;o untainted as their own Sons, without de&s;troying the Force of their own Ob|jection; and whom &s;urely they would not exclude from the public Benefit.</P>
<P>But above all, if we &s;hould allow that a Village is the be&s;t Situation of a College, (which few will allow) yet I deny that any Place, where a College is fixt, can continue long in the Nature of a Village, but mu&s;t &s;oon grow into a con&s;iderable Town; and thus with|out any of the Advantages of <HI>New-York,</HI> the fixing our College el&s;ewhere, would, in a few Years, be attended with all the Inconveniences we meant to &s;hun; be&s;ides &s;truggling with innumerable Difficulties at fir&s;t, and ri&s;quing the Succe&s;s of the whole Scheme.</P>
<P>There is &s;till le&s;s Force in the other Part of the Ob|jection, that the Scholars will not apply &s;o clo&s;ely to
<PB N="8" REF="006935_0016_102A9B9B89D4F7C0">
their Studies at <HI>New-York,</HI> as in a more retir'd Place. Is it not Emulation, or a Sen&s;e of Shame and Honor, that can alone render Youth indu&s;trious, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are become capable of Reflection? And will not this Emulation always exert it&s;elf in Proportion to the Notions they entertain of tho&s;e in who&s;e Sight they act? Will it not be &s;tronger in the City of <HI>New-York,</HI> where the poli&s;hed and learned Part of the Province are their Judges, and frequently vi&s;it them, than in any other Place, where the People know nothing of the Matter? For this Rea&s;on it was, that &s;ome Nations not only fixed their Colleges or public Schools in their chief Cities, but even made choice of Porticos or open Halls for this Purpo&s;e, in the mo&s;t frequented Places of tho&s;e Cities; that thus, in an Affair of &s;uch general Concern, every Per&s;on might be an Eye-Witne&s;s, both of the Fidelity of the Ma&s;ter and Indu&s;try of the Scholar: And that this Method begot the mo&s;t ardent Emu|lation, Rea&s;on as well as Experience may inform us. However, it is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that we &s;hould imitate them too clo&s;ely in this: Perhaps, for &s;everal obvious Rea&s;ons, &s;ome well air'd Place quite without the City, might be our mo&s;t prudent Choice;&mdash;but if there was no other Rea&s;on, I &s;hould think this one &s;trong enough, for fixing the College at lea&s;t contiguous to <HI>New-York:</HI> For, if ever we expect to &s;ee it flouri&s;hing, there mu&s;t be a few Gentlemen of the be&s;t Character, both for Learning and Probity, cho&s;en as Vi&s;itors and even Directors at fir&s;t, Now, tho' there may be Gen|tlemen very well qualified for this in the Country, yet there would be no Po&s;&s;ibility of finding a Quorum of them near one another; and if they were cho&s;en from different Counties, they could never meet &s;o often, or &s;o conveniently, as to an&s;wer the De&s;ign: And there|fore the Majority at lea&s;t of the&s;e Vi&s;itors, mu&s;t be cho&s;en from <HI>New-York,</HI> who likewi&s;e can be of little Service unle&s;s the College is near them.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="006935_0017_102A9B9F682BD040">
In &s;hort, in whatever Light I con&s;ider this Matter, I am &s;till the more of Opinion, that unle&s;s we chu&s;e this Situation, the Scheme will never &s;ucceed.&mdash;Where can we find &s;ufficient Accommodations for Diet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but in <HI>New-York?</HI> Are there not many Gentlemen who would &s;end their Sons to a College in <HI>New-York,</HI> who wou'd not &s;end them to a Village, where they mu&s;t be provided with Diet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> perhaps, in the Hou&s;e of &s;ome poor Artificer? And are not &s;uch Circum&s;tances likely to ruin the Undertaking, &s;ince the Succe&s;s of all Schemes depends much on the Notions fir&s;t entertain'd of them.</P>
<P>But further, the Knowledge of <HI>Languages, Philo&s;o|phy</HI> and <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> is but a &s;mall Part of the Edu|cation of &s;uch as are de&s;ign'd to be u&s;eful in Society: Tho&s;e ought to know Men and the World. For this Rea&s;on, our European Countrymen, tho' educated in the mo&s;t refin'd Cities, travel into foreign Countries; but as our Youth can have no Opportunity of travel|ling, we &s;hould make up that Lo&s;s to them as well as we can, by &s;ending them a few Years to the polite&s;t Part of our Province. Now &s;uch is the State of our Affairs, that the Generality of them mu&s;t be Farmers of their own E&s;tates, and therefore, can allot but a &s;mall Part of their Time to the Purpo&s;es of Education, which ought to be well hu&s;banded, by fixing the Col|lege in a Place where, at one and the &s;ame Time, they can learn the <HI>Belles Lettres,</HI> Breeding, and &s;ome Know|ledge of Men and Things: And thus, that Frugality and Indu&s;try, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in the Infancy of States, pleads &s;trongly for fixing the College at <HI>New-York,</HI> &s;ince the Circum&s;tances of our Country Youth, will not admit of their &s;pending any Part of their Time (after their Collegiate Education is fini&s;h'd) in vi&s;iting polite Cities, in order to &s;hake off that aukward Bluntne&s;s, which they mu&s;t contract, if immur'd at Schools and Colleges apart from the Sight of Men, for the fir&s;t Twenty Years of their Life: And if they could afford the Ex|pence
<PB N="10" REF="006935_0018_102A9BA1D2058298">
and Time nece&s;&s;ary to this, then indeed would they run a hundred Times more Danger of Corruption, when living at large, as their own Ma&s;ters, than when under the Tuition of others:&mdash;Be&s;ides, &s;uch as have not acquir'd the Air of the Gentleman when young, find it too late when grown up.</P>
<P>I know there are &s;ome who talk very lightly of this, and think it no nece&s;&s;ary Part of Education:&mdash;But of a very different Opinion was the noble Author of the Characteri&s;ticks; than whom, none ever &s;can'd human Nature with a more piercing or more candid Eye. In his Advice to an Author he &s;peaks thus; <Q>It &s;eems improbable, that according to modern Erudition, and as Science is now di&s;tributed, our ingenious Youths &s;hould obtain the full Advantage of a ju&s;t and liberal Education, by uniting the Scholar Part, with that of the real Gentleman and a Man of Breeding:&mdash;Letters are bani&s;h'd, I know not where, into di&s;tant Cloi&s;ters and unpractis'd Cells, confin'd to the mean Fellow|&s;hip of bearded Boys.&mdash;The &s;prightly Arts and Scien|ces are &s;ever'd from Philo&s;ophy, which con&s;equently mu&s;t grow droni&s;h, in&s;ipid, pedantic, u&s;ele&s;s, and directly oppo&s;ite to the real Knowledge and Practice of the World and Mankind. Our Youth accordingly &s;eem to have their Chance between two widely different Roads; either that of Pedantry and School-Learning, which lies amid&s;t the Dregs of ancient Literature; or that of the fa&s;hionable illiterate World, which aims merely at the Character of the fine Gentleman:</Q> But why not find the middle Road, and unite the Scholar with the Gentleman? <Q>Why might not a <HI>Homer,</HI> a <HI>Xenophon,</HI> a <HI>Tully, &amp;c.</HI> be &s;tudy'd as well in a CA|PITAL City and amid the World, as in a Country Town?</Q>&mdash;Thus far this great Writer: And if he thought it a Defect in our famous <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Univer&s;ities, that there were no Schools in them for the polite and manly Exerci&s;es, as in ancient <HI>Greece;</HI>&mdash;if he thought
<PB N="11" REF="006935_0019_102A9BA35D5287E0">
the Fellow&s;hip of bearded Boys, as he calls them, even in the poli&s;h'd Cities of <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> unlikely to form a Man for Society, without a farther Com|merce with the World: What would he have thought had one told him; that in half a Century after his Death, a Society of his Countrymen, in a remote Pro|vince of the World, would be &s;o little concerned to give their Youth the few Advantages of this Kind, which are in their Power (by fixing their fir&s;t Seminary in their mo&s;t poli&s;h'd City) as to propo&s;e bani&s;hing them and Learning together, into, I know not what, lonely Corner of a half &s;ettled Country?&mdash;Who that knows the Method of Education practis'd among the <HI>Romans,</HI> and how careful they were to accu&s;tom their Youth betimes to &s;tand the Sight of Men, unaba&s;h'd, by making them as early as the Age of Sixteen, (often &s;ooner) declaim publicly; "not on fanciful The&s;es, but Ca&s;es that might really be brought into their Courts of Judicature;" I &s;ay, who that knows this, could help being &s;urpris'd it &s;hould ever enter into our Thoughts, to &s;end our Youth into the Depths of Woods, to perform their Collegiate Exerci&s;es, in the unambitious Pre&s;ence of inanimate Trees?&mdash;What a &s;orry Figure is a young Man like to make thus educated, in a four Retreat from the World, when he obtains the Honor of a Seat in our A&s;&s;embly, or is nominated a Judge in any of our Counties? How thoroughly ignorant mu&s;t he be of the Heart of Man, and how incapable to trace Villainy thro' its various Mazes, in order to reach Truth? Of what avail will his Learning be, but to render him &s;o much the more a narrow-&s;oul'd and con|ceited Pedant? And what his boa&s;ted Innocence, but to make him &s;o much the more an ignorant Dupe.&mdash;</P>
<P>I am far from thinking it nece&s;&s;ary, that our Youth &s;hould be Ma&s;ters of all the in&s;ipid Punctilios of <HI>French Polite&s;&s;e,</HI> nor is there any Danger of this in our Country; but there is an artificial Manner of &s;oftning our natural
<PB N="12" REF="006935_0020_102A9BA601DBFB90">
Roughne&s;s, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the Man from the Savage; and a certain Ea&s;ine&s;s of Behaviour, which is the Characteri&s;tic of the Gentleman;&mdash;this I could wi&s;h to &s;ee every one Ma&s;ter of, who acts in any higher Sphere, it being the peculiar Ornament of a public Station. Now I hope no one will think it any Re|flection to &s;ay, this &s;o nece&s;&s;ary Air of the Gentleman, is not to be acquir'd in any Part of this Country but our capital City. Whoever knows the general Cha|racter of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Squire, that has been buried all his Days in the Country without the Benefit of a public Education, will own the Truth of this. It is well indeed, if we have one City that is arrived at this ne|ce&s;&s;ary Pitch of Politene&s;s; and, if She is, I hope never to &s;ee her go farther.&mdash;</P>
<P>It may be objected by &s;ome, that Education will be more expen&s;ive at <HI>New-York,</HI> than in the Country: But this Objection, like all the Others, ari&s;e wholly from our not con&s;idering how Things mu&s;t be &s;ome Years hence.&mdash;Even at pre&s;ent, I don't &s;ee that Provi&s;ions are much cheaper in the Country than in <HI>New-York;</HI> and I'm &s;ure, were there a College fix'd at any of our Villages, where there is no regular Market, there would be &s;uch a Difficulty of Ending Provi&s;ions at fir&s;t, and the Country People would know &s;o well how to take the Advantage of this, that every Thing would for &s;ome Time be dearer than at <HI>New-York;</HI> and it is &s;eldom that the Prices of Things, when once rai&s;ed in a Place, are &s;uffered to fall again, e&s;pecially where the Number of People would probably be increas'd yearly.</P>
<P>But the main Expence is apprehended from the Ar|ticle of Fuel for Fire: To this I an&s;wer, that Firewood in a few Years, mu&s;t be cheaper at <HI>New-York</HI> than in any Inland Place; for, fix our College where we will, the Woods near it mu&s;t &s;oon fail, and then, it mu&s;t be much more expen&s;ive to be &s;upplied by Land than Water Carriages. Be&s;ides, 'tis the Opinion of
<PB N="13" REF="006935_0021_102A9BA9DB89A308">
many, that in le&s;s perhaps than a half a Century, Coal will be the cheape&s;t Fuel that can be u&s;ed in mo&s;t Pla|ces of this Province; and in that Ca&s;e&punc; I need not add that a College at <HI>New-York,</HI> can more ea&s;ily be &s;upplied with that Commodity, than in any other Place of this Country.</P>
<P>As to incident Expences, it ought to be reckon'd a happy Circum&s;tance, when a young Man has the Ta&s;te and Spirit to be ambitious of &s;pending what Pocket-Money is allow'd him, in the be&s;t Company he can find; and it entirely depends on the Parents them&s;elves how great this Expence &s;hall be: For Youth, at Colleges any where, always find the Way to the Bottom of their Pur&s;es, and they can go no farther at <HI>New-York:</HI>&mdash;Be&s;ides, I hope I have &s;aid enough above, to convince any impartial Parent, that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, their Sons &s;hould pa&s;s &s;ome Part of their younger Years at <HI>New-York;</HI> and therefore, that the fixing our College there, will be &s;o far from being more expen&s;ive, that &s;ome Years of Time and a very con&s;iderable Sum of Money mu&s;t thereby be &s;aved to Them.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole then, I flatter my&s;elf, the impar|tial Part of the Country Gentlemen, are fully per&s;uaded, by this Time, that to place the College at <HI>New-York,</HI> mu&s;t be much to their Advantage, tho' it be pretty indif|ferent to the People of that City.&mdash;I have made it as probable as the NATURE of the Thing will admit, that the Morals of their Sons will, at lea&s;t, be as &s;afe there, as at a public College any where el&s;e:&mdash;That they will be far more alert, indu&s;trious and emulous of Improvement:&mdash;That in any other Situation, the Meane&s;s of Company, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mu&s;t make them contract a Lowne&s;s of Ta&s;te; and in&s;tead of this noble Emulation, beget a lifele&s;s Stupi|dity and Languor, which mu&s;t hurt the Character of our College at fir&s;t, and, probably, &s;oon prove its Ruin:&mdash;That as there is as yet but one Place in this Province, where the Breeding of the Gentleman can
<PB N="14" REF="006935_0022_102A9BAB6B98C058">
be acquir'd, and our Youth can &s;pare no Part of their Time for this Purpo&s;e but when at College; we ought, for the Sake of &s;aving Time and Money, to fix our College in this ONE Place, otherwi&s;e we deny them all Chance of uniting the Gentleman with the Scholar, or ever arriving at that Politene&s;s which is the Bond of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ocial Life,&mdash;the Ornament of human Nature.</P>
<P>I can &s;ee no Way of eluding the Force of the&s;e Argu|ments, but by &s;aying, that the Politene&s;s, which I have all along been contending for, is to be acquir'd by conver&s;ing with inanimate Nature, or is altogether unnece&s;&s;ary; and this would di&s;cover &s;uch a Barbarity of Ta&s;te and Sentiment, that I am far from expecting to hear that any One, who a&s;&s;umes the Name of a Gentleman, will henceforth &s;hew him&s;elf a Stickler for the rural Situation; and I am bound in Charity to be|lieve, tho&s;e who formerly have been &s;uch, have &s;uffered them&s;elves to be hurried away by the popular Objection concerning the Corruption of Morals, without examin|ing the Di&s;pute in all its Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Indeed, were the Objection admitted in its full Force, the Evil would be overbalanc'd by numberle&s;s Advan|tages. At <HI>New-York,</HI> our Youth will, at lea&s;t, obtain as much Knowledge of the World, as will, in ordinary Occurrences, enable them to under&s;tand their own and Country's Intere&s;t, without any Danger of being mi&s;|led or duped by de&s;igning Men: And if they &s;hould run into &s;ome more of the Extravagancies of Youth here than el&s;ewhere, (which I flatly deny,) yet wou'd it have no bad Effect upon them, when they return to the Scenes of &s;till Life, and a laborious Indu&s;try in the Country:&mdash;

It is very po&s;&s;ible I may be wrong in &s;ome of my Opinions; but, if I did not firmly believe them right, I &s;hould not have dared to publi&s;h them in an Affair of &s;o general Importance: And therefore, where I am wrong, I hope to be forgiven with the &s;ame Candor, with which una&s;k'd, I have endeavour'd to &s;et this Matter in its true Light.&mdash;</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion is indeed quite new to me, which per|haps, has made me handle it in a different Manner from what otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have done.&mdash;It is true, it has been di&s;puted, whether mere Boys &s;hould learn Gram|mar at private Schools, or public Ones in large Cities: <HI>Quintilian,</HI> the be&s;t of Judges, prefers a public School from the very fir&s;t; &s;o doth a fine Writer in the <HI>Spec|tator,</HI> (N^o. 313, 337. <HI>&amp;c.</HI>)&mdash;The great Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> is indeed of the other Opinion, but then he &s;peaks warmly of the Advantages of public Education, and tells us the Method he propo&s;es, is only calculated for GENTLEMEN's Sons of large Fortunes, when they are very young, and may be con&s;idered as white Paper, be&s;ides he makes Travelling an expre&s;s Condition:&mdash;I &s;ay this has been di&s;puted; but whether a College for fini&s;hing the Education of &s;uch as are grown up to be Men, &s;hould be in a poli&s;h'd City, was never perhaps di&s;puted before; e&s;pecially when de&s;ign'd, for &s;uch as can have no other Opportunity to know any Thing of polite Life. I am &s;ure, we have no In&s;tance of any <HI>European</HI> Nations, that did not plant their fir&s;t Semi|naries in their be&s;t Cities; and if any of them had been &s;o romantic, as to chu&s;e a de&s;ert Corner for this Purpo&s;e, it wou'd &s;oon, as I &s;aid before, have fall'n into all the In|conveniences of a populous Place, tho' perhaps in many Centuries it would not have had the Advantages of a polite ONE.&mdash;</P>

After all, if I might pre&s;ume to advi&s;e, I can't help &s;aying we begin at the wrong End, if we apply the Money already rais'd, to the immediate Rearing of a Building. I &s;ubmit it to the better Judgment of tho&s;e concerned, whether it were not the better Method, to apply the Intere&s;t of the &pound; 3443: 18 s. forthwith, as Salaries for two &s;ufficient Men, each to teach two Cla&s;&s;es at fir&s;t; <HI>viz.</HI> the One GREEK and LATIN, with the mo&s;t u&s;eful Branches of the MATHEMATICS; and the Other moral PHILOSOPHY, and what is comprehended under the general Name of PHYSICS.

And would not this be better, to &s;ee our Youth in the mean Time reaping the Benefit, while our Edifice ri&s;es by Degrees, and with the Conveniency of the Country, than to expend the Money already rais'd in rearing a Building, which, when fini&s;h'd, mu&s;t &s;tand &s;everal Years perhaps, as a Monument of our Poverty, or &s;omething wor&s;e, before we are able to rai&s;e a Fund for endowing it and providing for Tea|chers, which is the main Point:&mdash;In this Ca&s;e it would at lea&s;t be a dozen Years e're our Youth can be ad|vantag'd by it, tho' the Country were much more in the Humor of contributing to this laudable Work than they &s;eem to be;&mdash;and therefore</P>
