<HEAD>A CHARGE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Beloved Brethren of the African Lodge,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS now five years &s;ince I deliver'd a Charge to you on &s;ome parts and points of Ma&s;onry. As one branch or &s;u|per&s;tructure on the foundation; when I endeavoured to &s;hew you the duty of a Ma|&s;on to a Ma&s;on, and charity or love to all mankind, as the mark and image of the great God, and the Father of the human race.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now attempt to &s;hew you, that it is our duty to &s;ympathi&s;e with our fellow men under their troubles: the families of our brethren who are gone: we hope to the Grand Lodge above, here to return no more. But the cheerfulne&s;s that you have ever had to relieve them, and ea&s;e their burdens, un|der their &s;orrows, will never be forgotten by them; and in this manner you will never be weary in doing good.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="032218_0003_0FF1915B50D3D0C8">
But my brethren, although we are to be|gin here, we mu&s;t not end here; for only look around you and you will &s;ee and hear of numbers of our fellow men crying out with holy Job, Have pity on me, O my friends, for the hand of the Lord hath touched me. And this is not to be confi|ned to parties or colours; not to towns or &s;tates; not to a kingdom, but to the king|doms of the whole earth, over whom Chri&s;t the king is head and grand ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e numerous &s;ons and daugh|ters of di&s;tre&s;s, I &s;hall begin with our friends and brethren; and fir&s;t, let us &s;ee them dragg'd from their native country, by the iron hand of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, from their dear friends and connections, with weeping eyes and aching hearts, to a &s;trange land and &s;trange people, who&s;e tender mer|cies are cruel; and there to bear the iron yoke of &s;lavery &amp; cruelty till death as a friend &s;hall relieve them. And mu&s;t not the un|happy condition of the&s;e our fellow men draw forth our hearty prayer and wi&s;hes for their deliverance from the&s;e merchants and traders, who&s;e characters you have in the x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iii chap. of the Revelations, 11, 12, &amp; 13

ver&s;es, and who knows but the&s;e &s;ame &s;ort of traders may in a &s;hort time, in the like manner, bewail the lo&s;s of the African traffick, to their &s;hame and confu&s;ion: and if I mi&s;take not, it now begins to dawn in &s;ome of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands; which puts me in mind of a nation (that I have &s;omewhere read of) called Ethiopeans, that cannot change their &s;kin: But God can and will change their conditions, and their hearts too; and let Bo&s;ton and the world know, that He hath no re&s;pect of per&s;ons; and that that bulwark of envy, pride, &s;corn and con|tempt; which is &s;o vi&s;ible to be &s;een in &s;ome and felt, &s;hall fall, to ri&s;e no more.</P>
<P>When we hear of the bloody wars which are now in the world, and thou&s;ands of our fellow men &s;lain; fathers and mothers be|wailing the lo&s;s of their &s;ons; wives for the lo&s;s of their hu&s;bands; towns and cities burnt and de&s;troy'd; what mu&s;t be the heart-felt &s;orrow and di&s;tre&s;s of the&s;e poor and unhappy people! Though we cannot help them, the di&s;tance being &s;o great, yet we may &s;ympathize with them in their troubles, and mingle a tear of &s;orrow with them, and do as we are exhorted to&mdash;weep with tho&s;e that weep.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="032218_0005_0FF19161A2C5A450">
Thus my brethren we &s;ee what a chequer|ed world we live in. Sometimes happy in having our wives and children like olive-branches about our tables; receiving the bounties of our great Benefactor. The next year, or month, or week, we may be deprived of &s;ome of them, and we go mourn|ing about the &s;treets: &s;o in &s;ocieties; we are this day to celebrate this Fea&s;t of St. John's, and the next week we might be called up|on to attend a funeral of &s;ome one here, as we have experienced &s;ince our la&s;t in this Lodge. So in the common affairs of life we &s;ometimes enjoy health and pro&s;perity; at another time &s;ickne&s;s and adver&s;ity, cro&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments.</P>
<P>So in &s;tates and kingdoms; &s;ometimes in tranquility; then wars and tumults; rich to day, and poor to-morrow; which &s;hews that there is not an independent mortal on earth; but dependent one upon the other, from&punc; the king to the beggar.</P>
<P>The great law-giver, Mo&s;es, who in|&s;tructed by his father-in-law, Jethro, an Ethiopean, how to regulate his courts of ju&s;tice, and what &s;ort of men to choo&s;e for the different offices; hear now my words,
<PB N="7" REF="032218_0006_0FF1916AB39254E0">
&s;aid he, I will give you coun&s;el, and God &s;hall be with you; be thou for the people to Godward, that thou maye&s;t bring the cau&s;es unto God, and thou &s;hall teach them ordinances and laws, and &s;hall &s;hew the way wherein they mu&s;t walk; and the work that they mu&s;t do: moreover thou &s;hall provide out of all the people, able men, &s;uch as fear God, men of truth, hating co|vetou&s;ne&s;s, and place &s;uch over them, to be rulers of thou&s;ands, of hundreds and of tens.</P>
<P>So Mo&s;es hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he &s;aid.&mdash;Exodus xviii. 22&mdash;24.</P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t and grande&s;t lecture that Mo&s;es ever received from the mouth of man; for Jethro under&s;tood geometry as well as laws, <HI>that</HI> a Ma&s;on may plainly &s;ee: &s;o a little captive &s;ervant maid by who&s;e advice Nomen, the great general of Syria's army was healed of his lepro&s;y; and by a &s;ervant his proud &s;pirit was brought down: 2 Kings, v. 3&mdash;14. The feelings of this little captive, for this great man, her captor, was &s;o great, that &s;he forgot her &s;tate of captivity, and felt for the di&s;tre&s;s of her enemy. Would to God (&s;aid &s;he to her
<PB N="8" REF="032218_0007_0FF1916337DCA0F0">
mi&s;tre&s;s) my lord were with the prophets in Samaria, he &s;hould be healed of his le|pro&s;y: So after he went to the prophet, his proud ho&s;t was &s;o haughty that he not only di&s;dain'd the prophet's direction, but deri|ded the good old prophet; and had it not been for his &s;ervant, he would have gone to his grave, with a double lepro&s;y, the out|ward and the inward, in the heart, which is the wor&s;t of lepro&s;ies; a black heart is wor&s;e than a white lepro&s;y.</P>
<P>How unlike was this great general's beha|viour to that of as grand a character, and as well beloved by his prince as he was; I mean Obadiah, to a like prophet. See for this 1&s;t Kings, xviii. from 7 to the 16th.</P>
<P>And as Obadiah was in the way, behold Elijah met him, and he knew him, and fell on his face, and &s;aid, Art not thou, my Lord, Elijah, and he told him, Yea, go and tell thy Lord, behold Elijah is here: and &s;o on to the 16th ver&s;e. Thus we &s;ee, that great and good men have, and always will have, a re&s;pect for mini&s;ters and &s;ervants of God. Another in&s;tance of this is in Acts viii. 27 to 31, of the European Eunuch, a man of great authority, to Philip, the
<PB N="9" REF="032218_0008_0FF191679E988118">
apo&s;tle: here is mutual love and friend&s;hip between them. This mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t did not think him&s;elf too good to receive the hand, and ride in a chariot with a black man in the face of day; neither did this great mo|narch (for &s;o he was) think it beneath him to take a poor &s;ervant of the Lord by the hand, and invite him into his carriage, though but with a &s;taff, one coat and no money in his pocket. So our Grand Ma&s;ter, Solomon, was not a&s;ham'd to take the Queen of Sheba by the hand, and lead her into his court, at the hour of high twelve, and there conver&s;e with her on points of ma&s;onry (for if ever there was a female ma&s;on in the world &s;he was one) and other curious matters; and gratified her, by &s;hewing her all his riches and curious pie|ces of architecture in the temple, and in his hou&s;e: After &s;ome time &s;taying with her, he loaded her with much rich pre&s;ents: he gave her the right hand of affection and parted in love.</P>
<P>I hope that no one will dare openly (tho' in fact the behaviour of &s;ome implies as much) to &s;ay, as our Lord &s;aid on another occa&s;ion. Be|hold a greater than Solomon is here. But yet let them con&s;ider that our Grand Ma&s;ter Solo|mon did not divide the living child, whatever he might do with the dead one, neither did he pretend to make a law, to forbid the parties
<PB N="10" REF="032218_0009_0FF19120DAC5B2E0">
from having free intercour&s;e with one another without the fear of cen&s;ure, or be turned out of the &s;ynagogue.</P>
<P>Now my brethren, as we &s;ee and experience, that all things hear are frail and changeable and nothing here to be depended upon: Let us &s;eek tho&s;e things which are above, which are &s;ure and &s;tedfa&s;t, and unchangeable, and at the &s;ame time let us pray to Almighty God, while we remain in the tabernacle, that he would give us the grace of patience and &s;trength to bear up under all our troubles, which at this day God knows we have our &s;hare. Patience I &s;ay, for were we not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a great mea|&s;ure of it you could not bear up under the dai|ly in&s;ults you meet with in the &s;treets of Bo&s;|ton; much more on public days of recreation, how are you &s;hamefully abus'd, and that at &s;uch a degree, that you may truly be &s;aid to carry your lives in your hands; and the arrows of death are flying about your heads; helple&s;s old women have their clothes torn off their backs, even to the expo&s;ing of their nakedne&s;s; and by whom are the&s;e di&s;graceful and abu&s;ive actions committed, not by the men born and bred in Bo&s;ton, for they are better bred; but by a mob or horde of &s;hamele&s;s, low-lived, envious, &s;piteful per&s;ons, &s;ome of them not long &s;ince, &s;ervants in gentlemen's kitchings, &s;couring knives, tending hor&s;es, and driving

chai&s;e. 'Twas &s;aid by a gentleman who &s;aw that filthy behaviour in the common, that in all the places he had been in, he never &s;aw &s;o cruel behaviour in all his life, and that a &s;lave in the We&s;t-Indies, on Sunday or holidays enjoys him|&s;elf and friends without any mole&s;tation. Not only this man, but many in town who hath &s;een their behaviour to you, and that without any provocations, twenty or thirty cowards fall upon one man, have wonder'd at the patience of the Blacks: 'tis not for want of courage in you, for they know that they dare not face you man for man, but in a mob, which we de&s;pi&s;e, and had rather &s;uffer wrong than to do wrong, to the di&s;turbance of the community and the di&s;grace of our reputation: for every good citizen doth honor to the laws of the State where he re&s;ides.</P>
<P>My brethren, let us not be ca&s;t down under the&s;e and many other abu&s;es we at pre&s;ent la|bour under: for the darke&s;t is before the break of day: My brethren, let us remember what a dark day it was with our African bre|thren &s;ix years ago, in the French We&s;t-Indies. Nothing but the &s;nap of the whip was heard from morning to evening; hanging, broken on the wheel, burning, and all manner of tor|tures inflicted on tho&s;e unhappy people, for nothing el&s;e but to gratify their ma&s;ters pride, wantonne&s;s and cruelty: but ble&s;&s;ed be God,
<PB N="12" REF="032218_0011_0FF19172061F5A30">
the &s;cene is changed; they now confe&s;s that God hath no re&s;pect of per&s;ons, and therefore receive them as their friends, and treat them as brothers. Thus doth Ethiopia begin to &s;tretch forth her hand, from a &s;ink of &s;lavery to freedom and equality.</P>
<P>Although you are deprived of the means of education; yet you are not deprived of the means of meditation; by which I mean think|ing, hearing and weighing matters, men and things in your own mind, and making that judg|ment of them as you think rea&s;onable to &s;atisfy your minds and give an an&s;wer to tho&s;e who may a&s;k you a que&s;tion. This nature hath furni&s;hed you with, without letter learning; and &s;ome have made great progre&s;s therein, &s;ome of tho&s;e I have heard repeat p&s;alms and hymns, and a great part of a &s;ermon, only by hearing it read or preached and why not in other things in nature: how many of this cla&s;s of our bre|thren that follow the &s;eas; can foretell a &s;torm &s;ome days before it comes; whether it will be a heavy or light, a long or &s;hort one; foretell a hurricane whether it will be de&s;tructive or mo|derate; without any other means than ob&s;erva|tion and con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>So in the ob&s;ervation of the heavenly bodies, this &s;ame cla&s;s without a telle&s;cope or other ap|paratus have through a &s;moak'd gla&s;s ob&s;erved the eclip&s;e of the &s;un: One being a&s;k'd what

As &s;imple as the an&s;wers are they have a meaning, and &s;hew, that God can out of the mouth of babes and Africans &s;hew forth his glory; let us then love and adore him as the God who defends us and &s;upports us and will &s;upport us under our pre&s;|&s;ures, let them be ever &s;o heavy and pre&s;&s;ing. Let us by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, in what&s;oever &s;tate we are, or may be in, to be content; for clouds and darkne&s;s are about him; but ju&s;tice and truth is his habitation; who hath &s;aid, Vengeance is mine and I will repay it, there|fore let us ki&s;s the rod and be &s;till, and &s;ee the works of the Lord.</P>
<P>Another thing I would warn you again&s;t, is the &s;lavi&s;h fear of man, which bringe&s;t a &s;nare, faith Solomon. This pa&s;&s;ion of fear, like pride and envy, hath &s;lain its thou&s;ands.&mdash;What but this makes &s;o many perjure them|&s;elves; for fear of offending them at home they are a little depending on, for &s;ome trifles: A man that is under a panic of fear, is affraid to be alone; you cannot hear of a robbery or hou&s;e broke open or &s;et on fire, but he hath an

accomplice with him, who mu&s;t &s;hare the &s;poil with him, whereas if he was truly bold, and void of fear, he would keep the whole plunder to him&s;elf: &s;o when either of them is detected and not the other, he may be call'd to oath to keep it &s;ecret, but through fear, (and that pa&s;&s;ion is &s;o &s;trong) he will not confe&s;s, till the fatal cord is put on his neck; then death will deliver him from the fear of man, and he will confe&s;s the truth when it will not be of any good to him&s;elf or the community: nor is this pa&s;&s;ion of fear only to be found in this cla&s;s of men, but among the great.</P>
<P>What was the rea&s;on that our African kings and princes have plunged them&s;elves and their peaceable kingdoms into bloody wars, to the de&s;toying of towns and kingdoms, but the fear of the report of a great gun or the glittering of arms and &s;words, which &s;truck the&s;e kings near the &s;eaports with &s;uch a panic of fear, as not only to de&s;troy the peace and happine&s;s of their in|land brethren, but plung'd millions of their fel|low countrymen into &s;lavery and cruel bon|dage.</P>
<P>So in other countries: &s;ee Felix trembling on his throne. How many Emperors and kings have left their kingdoms and be&s;t friends, at the &s;ight of a handful of men in arms: how many have we &s;een that have left their e&s;tates and their friends and ran over to the &s;tronger &s;ide as they

thought: all through the fear of men; who is but a worm, and hath no more power to hurt his fellow worm, without the permi&s;&s;ion of God, than a real worm.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee my brethren, what a mi&s;erable condition it is to be under the &s;lavi&s;h fear of men; it is of &s;uch a de&s;tructive nature to man|kind, that the &s;criptures every where from Gene&s;is to the Revelations warns us again&s;t it; and even our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour him&s;elf forbids us from this &s;lavi&s;h fear of man, in his &s;ermon on the mount; and the only way to avoid it is to be in the fear of God: let a man con&s;ider the greatne&s;s of his power, as the maker and upholder of all things here below, and that in Him we live, and move, and have our being, the giver of the mercies we enjoy here from day to day, and that our lives are in his hands, and that he made the heavens, the &s;un, moon and &s;tars to move in their various orders; let us thus view the greatne&s;s of God, and then turn our eyes on mortal man, a worm, a &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">le, a water, and &s;ee whether he is an object of fear or not; on the contrary, you will think him in his be&s;t e&s;tate, to be but vanity, feeble and a dependent mortal, and &s;tands in need of your help, and cannot do without your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in &s;ome way or other; and yet &s;ome of the&s;e&punc; poor mortals will try to make you believe they are Gods, but wor&s;hip them not. My bre|thren

let us pay all due re&s;pect to all whom God hath put in places of honor over us: do ju&s;tly and be faithful to them that hire you, and treat them with that re&s;pect they may de&s;erve; but wor&s;hip no man. Wor&s;hip God, this much is your duty as chri&s;tians and as ma&s;ons.</P>
<P>We &s;ee then how becoming and nece&s;&s;ary it is to have a fellow feeling for our di&s;tre&s;s'd brethren of the human race, in their troubles, both &s;piritual and temporal&mdash;How refre&s;hing it is to a &s;ick man, to &s;ee his &s;ympathi&s;ing friends around his bed, ready to admini&s;ter all the re|lief in their power; although they can't re|lieve his bodily pain yet they may ea&s;e his mind by good in&s;tructions and cheer his heart by their company.</P>
<P>How doth it cheer up the heart of a man when his hou&s;e is on fire, to &s;ee a number of friends coming to his relief; he is &s;o tran&s;port|ed that he almo&s;t forgets his lo&s;s and his dan|ger, and fills him with love and gratitude&punc; and their joys and &s;orrows are mutual.</P>

Here we &s;ee the hand of God in various ways, bringing about his own glory for the good of mankind, by the mutual help of their fellow men; which ought to teach us in all our &s;traits, be they what they may, to put our tru&s;t in Him, firmly believing, that he is able and will deli|ver us and defend us again&s;t all our enemies; and that no weapon form'd again&s;t us &s;hall pro&s;per; only let us be &s;teady and uniform in our walks, &s;peech and behaviour; always do|ing to all men as we wi&s;h and de&s;ire they would do to us in the like ca&s;es and circum|&s;tances.</P>
