<P>WE are a&s;&s;embled this day upon a mournful occa&s;ion. Death has made an in|road upon our Society. Our illu&s;trious and beloved PRESIDENT, is no more. RITTEN|HOUSE, the ingenious, the mode&s;t, and the wi&s;e&mdash;RITTENHOUSE, the friend of God and man, is now no more!&mdash;For this, the temple of Science is hung in mourning,&mdash;for this, our eyes now drop a tributary tear. Nor do we weep alone.&mdash;The United States of America &s;ympathize in our grief, for his name gave a &s;plendor to the American character, and the friends of humanity in di&s;tant parts of the world, unite with us in lamenting our com|mon lo&s;s,&mdash;for he belonged to the whole human race.</P>
<P>By your vote to perpetuate the memory of this great and good man, you have made a laud|able
<PB N="6" REF="031143_0005_0FEAC74639BA6D58">
attempt to re&s;cue philo&s;ophers from their humble rank in the hi&s;tory of mankind. It is to them we owe our knowledge and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mo&s;t of the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences of life. To procure the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings for us, "they trim their midnight lamp, and hang o'er the &s;ickly taper." For us, they traver&s;e di&s;tant regions, expo&s;e them&s;elves to the inclemencies of the weather, mingle with &s;avages and bea&s;ts of prey, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, evince their love of &s;cience and humanity by the &s;acrifice of their lives.</P>
<P>The amiable philo&s;opher who&s;e talents and virtues are to be the &s;ubject of the following eulogium, is entitled to an uncommon portion of our gratitude and prai&s;e. He acquired his knowledge at the expence of uncommon exer|tions, he performed &s;ervices of uncommon dif|ficulty, and finally he impaired his health, and probably &s;hortened his life, by the ardor of his &s;tudies and labors for the benefit of mankind.</P>
<P>In attempting to di&s;charge the difficult and painful duty you have a&s;&s;igned me, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give a &s;hort account of the life of Mr. Rittenhou&s;e, ina&s;much as &s;everal of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting parts of his character are inti|mately connected with it.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="031143_0006_0FEAC74A5A2B6AC8">The village of Germantown in the neigh|bourhood of this city, had the honor of giving birth to this di&s;tingui&s;hed philo&s;opher on the 8th day of April, in the year 1732. His an|ce&s;tors migrated from Holland about the be|ginning of the pre&s;ent century. They were di&s;tingui&s;hed, together with his parents, for pro|bity, indu&s;try, and &s;imple manners. It is from &s;ources thus pure and retired, that tho&s;e talents and virtues have been chiefly derived, which have in all ages enlightened the world. They prove by their humble origin, that the Supreme Being has not &s;urrendered up the direction of human affairs to the advantages acquired by accident or vice, and they bear a con&s;tant and faithful te&s;timony of his impartial goodne&s;s, by their nece&s;&s;ary and regular influence in equaliz|ing the condition of mankind. This is the divine order of things, and every attempt to invert it, is a weak and unavailing effort to wre&s;t the govern|ment of the world from the hands of God.</P>
<P>The early part of the life of Mr. Rittenhou&s;e was &s;pent in agricultural employments under the eye of his father, in the county of Montgomery, twenty miles from Philadelphia, to which place he removed during the childhood of his Son. It was at this place his peculiar genius fir&s;t di&s;|covered
<PB N="8" REF="031143_0007_0FEAC74C00CA58C8">
it&s;elf. His plough, the fences, and even the &s;tones of the field in which he worked, were frequently marked with figures which denoted a talent for mathematical &s;tudies. Upon find|ing that the native delicacy of his con&s;titution unfitted him for the labors of hu&s;bandry, his parents con&s;ented to his learning the trade of a clock and mathematical in&s;trument maker. In acquiring the knowledge of the&s;e u&s;eful arts, he was his own in&s;tructor.&mdash;They afforded him great delight, ina&s;much as they favoured his di&s;po&s;ition to inquire into the principles of natural philo&s;ophy.&mdash;Con&s;tant employment of any kind, even in the practice of the me|chanical arts, has been found, in many in&s;tances, to admini&s;ter vigor to human genius. Franklin &s;tudied the laws of nature, while he handled his printing types. The father of Rou&s;&s;eau, a jew|eller at Geneva, became acquainted with the principles of national juri&s;prudence, by li&s;tening to his &s;on while he read to him in his &s;hop, the works of Grotius and Puffendorf; and Her&s;chel conceived the great idea of a new planet, while he exerci&s;ed the humble office of a mu&s;ician to a marching regiment.</P>
<P>It was during the re&s;idence of our ingenious philo&s;opher with his father in the country, that
<PB N="9" REF="031143_0008_0FEAC74EF7095330">
he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Sir I&s;aac Newton's Principia, which he read in the Engli&s;h tran&s;la|tion of Mr. Mott. It was here likewi&s;e he be|came acquainted with the &s;cience of Fluxions, of which &s;ublime invention he believed him&s;elf for a while to be the author, nor did he know for &s;ome years afterwards, that a conte&s;t had been carried on between Sir I&s;aac Newton and Leibnitz, for the honor of that great and u&s;eful di&s;covery. What a mind was here!&mdash; Without literary friends or &s;ociety, and with but two or three books, he became, before he had reached his four and twentieth year, the rival of the two greate&s;t mathematicians in Eu|rope!</P>
<P>It was in this retired &s;ituation, and while employed in working at his trade, that he plan|ned and executed an orrery, in which he repre|&s;ented the revolutions of the heavenly bodies in a manner more exten&s;ive and complete, than had been done by any former a&s;tronomers. A correct de&s;cription of this orrery drawn up by the Rev. Dr. Smith, is publi&s;hed in the fir&s;t vo|lume of our Tran&s;actions. This ma&s;ter-piece of ingenious mechani&s;m was purcha&s;ed by the col|lege of New-Jer&s;ey. A &s;econd was made by him, after the &s;ame model, for the u&s;e of the college
<PB N="10" REF="031143_0009_0FEAC75302084768">
of Philadelphia. It now forms part of the phi|lo&s;ophical apparatus of the Univer&s;ity of Penn|&s;ylvania, where it has for many years command|ed the admiration of the ingenious and the learned, from every part of the world.</P>
<P>The reputation he derived from the con|&s;truction of this orrery, as well as his general character for mathematical knowledge, attracted the notice of his fellow-citizens in Penn&s;ylva|nia, and in &s;everal of the neighbouring &s;tates, but the di&s;covery of his uncommon merit belonged chiefly to his brother-in-law, the Rev. Mr. Bar|ton, Dr. Smith, and the late Mr. John Lukens, an ingenious mathematician of this city. The&s;e gentlemen fully appreciated his talents, and uni|ted in urging him to remove to Philadelphia, in order to enlarge his opportunities of im|provement and u&s;efulne&s;s. He yielded with reluctance to their advice, and exchanged his be|loved retirement in the country for this city, in the year 1770. Here he continued for &s;everal years, to follow his occupation of a clock and mathematical in&s;trument maker. He excelled in both branches of that bu&s;ine&s;s. His mathe|matical in&s;truments have been e&s;teemed by good judges to be &s;uperior in accuracy and workman|&s;hip to any of the &s;ame kind that have been im|ported from Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="031143_0010_0FEAC75486769250">About the time he &s;ettled in Philadelphia he became a member of our Society. His fir&s;t communication to the Society was a calculation of the tran&s;it of Venus as it was to happen on the 3d of June, 1769, in 40&deg; north latitude, and 5 hours we&s;t longitude from Greenwich. He was one of a committee appointed by the So|ciety to ob&s;erve in the town&s;hip of Norriton, this rare occurrence in the revolution of that planet, and bore an active part in the preparations which were made for that purpo&s;e. Of this Dr. Smith who was likewi&s;e of the committee, has left an honourable record in the hi&s;tory of that event which is publi&s;hed in the fir&s;t volume of the tran&s;actions of our Society. "As Mr. Ritten|hou&s;e's dwelling (&s;ays the Doctor) is about twen|ty miles north-we&s;t from Philadelphia; our other engagements did not permit Mr. Lukens or my|&s;elf to pay much attention to the nece&s;&s;ary pre|parations; but we knew that we had intru&s;ted them to a gentleman on the &s;pot [meaning Mr. Rittenhou&s;e] who had, joined to a complete &s;kill in mechanics, &s;o exten&s;ive an a&s;tronomical, and mathematical knowledge, that the u&s;e, manage|ment and even con&s;truction of the apparatus, were perfectly familiar to him. The laudable pains he had taken in the&s;e material articles will
<PB N="12" REF="031143_0011_0FEAC757D94CD268">
be&s;t appear from the work it&s;elf, which he hath committed into my hands, with a mode&s;t intro|duction, giving me a liberty with them, which his own accuracy, ta&s;te and abilities leave no room to exerci&s;e."</P>
<P>We are naturally led here to take a view of our philo&s;opher with his a&s;&s;ociates in their pre|parations to ob&s;erve a phaenomenon which had never been &s;een but twice before by any in|habitant of our earth, which would never be &s;een again by any per&s;on then living, and on which depended very important a&s;tronomical con&s;equences. The night before the long ex|pected day, was probably pa&s;&s;ed in a degree of &s;olicitude which precluded &s;leep. How great mu&s;t have been their joy when they be|held the morning &s;un, "and the whole horizon without a cloud;" for &s;uch is the de&s;cription of the day given by Mr. Rittenhou&s;e in the report referred to by Dr. Smith. In pen&s;ive &s;ilence, and trembling anxiety, they waited for the pre|dicted moment of ob&s;ervation; it came, and brought with it all that had been wi&s;hed for and expected by tho&s;e who &s;aw it. In our philo&s;o|pher, it excited in the in&s;tant of one of the con|tacts of the planet with the &s;un, an emotion of delight &s;o exqui&s;ite and powerful, as to induce
<PB N="13" REF="031143_0012_0FEAC75C69B51BD8">
fainting. This will readily be believed by tho&s;e who have known the extent of that plea&s;ure which attends the di&s;covery, or fir&s;t perception of truth. Soon after this event, we find him acting as one of a committee appointed to ob|&s;erve the tran&s;it of Mercury on the 9th of No|vember in the &s;ame year. This was likewi&s;e done at Norriton. An account of it was drawn up, and publi&s;hed at the reque&s;t of the committee by Dr. Smith. A minute hi&s;tory of the whole of the&s;e events, in which Mr. Rittenhou&s;e con|tinued to act a di&s;tingui&s;hed part, is given in our tran&s;actions. It was received with great &s;atis|faction by the a&s;tronomers of Europe, and con|tributed much to rai&s;e the character of our then infant country for a&s;tronomical knowledge.</P>
<P>In the year 1775, he was appointed to com|po&s;e and deliver the annual oration before our &s;ociety. The &s;ubject of it, was the hi&s;tory of a&s;tronomy. The language of this oration is &s;imple, but the &s;entiments contained in it are ingenious, original, and in &s;ome in&s;tances &s;u|blime. It was delivered in a feeble voice, and without any of the advantages of oratory, but it commanded notwith&s;tanding, the mo&s;t pro|found attention, and was followed by univer&s;al admiration and applau&s;e from a crouded and re&s;pectable audience.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="031143_0013_0FEAC75DED7807A8">From the contents of this oration, it appears that A&s;tronomy was the favourite object of his &s;tudies. Attempts have been made to depreciate this branch of natural philo&s;ophy, by denying its utility, and application to human affairs.&mdash; The opinion is an unju&s;t one, and as it tends to convey a limited idea of the talents of Mr. Rittenhou&s;e, I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed in &s;aying a few words in &s;avour of this &s;cience.</P>
<P>It is to a&s;tronomy we are indebted for our knowledge of navigation, by which means the different parts of our globe have been di&s;cover|ed, and afterwards cemented together by the mutual wants and obligations of commerce.</P>
<P>It was a&s;tronomy that taught mankind the art of predicting and explaining eclip&s;es of the Sun and Moon, and thereby delivered them from the &s;uper&s;tition which in the early ages of the world, was connected with tho&s;e phaenomena of nature.</P>
<P>We are taught by a&s;tronomy to correct our ideas of the vi&s;ible heavens, and thus by di&s;cov|ering the fallacy of the &s;imple evidence of our &s;en&s;es, to call to their aid, the u&s;e of our rea&s;on, in deciding upon all the material objects of hu|man knowledge.</P>
<P>A&s;tronomy delivers the mind from a gro|veling attachment to the pur&s;uits and plea&s;ures
<PB N="15" REF="031143_0014_0FEAC7609B07B938">
of this world. "Take the mi&s;er (&s;ays our phi|lo&s;opher in his oration) from the earth, if it be po&s;&s;ible to di&s;engage him&mdash;he who&s;e nightly re&s;t has been long broken by the lo&s;s of a &s;in|gle foot of it, u&s;ele&s;s perhaps to him; and re|move him to the planet Mars, one of the lea&s;t di&s;tant from us&mdash;Per&s;uade the ambitious mo|narch to accompany him, who has &s;acrificed the lives of thou&s;ands of his &s;ubjects to an imagi|nary property in certain &s;mall portions of the earth, and point out this earth to them, with all its kingdoms and wealth, a glittering &s;tar, clo&s;e by the moon, the latter &s;carce vi&s;ible, and the former, le&s;s bright than our evening &s;tar.&mdash; They would turn away their di&s;gu&s;ted &s;ight from it, not thinking it worth their &s;malle&s;t attention, and &s;eek for con&s;olation, in the gloomy regions of Mars."</P>
<P>Once more&mdash;the &s;tudy of a&s;tronomy has the mo&s;t friendly influence upon morals, and re|ligion. "Yes, (&s;ays our philo&s;opher in ano|ther part of his oration) the direct tendency of this &s;cience is to dilate the heart with univer&s;al benevolence, and to enlarge its views. It flat|ters no princely vice, nor national depravity. It encourages not the libertine by relaxing any of the precepts of morality, nor does it attempt to
<PB N="16" REF="031143_0015_0FEAC763662F8EF8">
undermine the foundations of religion. It de|nies none of tho&s;e attributes, which the wi&s;e&s;t, and be&s;t of mankind have in all ages a&s;cribed to the Deity. Nor does it degrade the human mind from that dignity which is ever nece&s;&s;ary to make it contemplate <HI>it&s;elf</HI> with complacency. None of the&s;e things does a&s;tronomy pretend to, and if the&s;e things merit the name of philo&s;ophy, and the encouragement of a people, then let &s;ceptici&s;m flouri&s;h, and a&s;tronomy lie neglected. &mdash;Let the names of Berkley and Hume become immortal, and that of Newton be lo&s;t in obli|vion."&mdash;</P>

She claimed him as her own, and employed him in bu&s;ine&s;s of the mo&s;t important nature.</P>

<P>But the application of his talents and know|ledge to the &s;ettlement of territorial di&s;putes, was not confined to his native &s;tate. In the year 1769, he was employed in &s;ettling the limits between New Jer&s;ey and New York, and in 1787 he was called upon to a&s;&s;i&s;t in fixing the boundary line between the States of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts and New York.

be lamented that his private letters, and the me|mories of his friends, are the only records of what he collected upon the&s;e occa&s;ions.

And ci|tizens of Penn&s;ylvania, friends and patrons of literature, be grateful for his &s;ervices. Let the remembrance of them be dear to the pre&s;ent generation, and let a part of the &s;tate, di&s;tingui&s;h|ed in a more e&s;pecial manner for its re&s;ources in natural knowledge, bear his name with honor to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>In the year 1791 he was cho&s;en &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Dr. Franklin in the chair of our &s;ociety. In this elevated &s;tation, the highe&s;t that philo&s;ophy can confer in our country, his conduct was marked by its u&s;ual line of propriety and dig|nity. Never did the artificial pomp of &s;tation

command half the re&s;pect, which followed his una&s;&s;uming manners in the di&s;charge of the public duties of this office. You will often re|collect, gentlemen, with a mixture of plea&s;ure and pain, the delightful evenings you pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;ociety, every time he pre&s;ided in your meet|ings. They were uniformly characterized by ardor in the pur&s;uits of &s;cience, urbanity and brotherly kindne&s;s. His attachment to the in|tere&s;ts of the &s;ociety was evinced &s;oon after he accepted of the Pre&s;ident's chair, by a donation of three hundred pounds.</P>
<P>But his talents and knowledge were not limited to mathematical or material &s;ubjects; his mind was a repo&s;itory of the knowledge of all ages and countries. He had early and deeply &s;tudied mo&s;t of the different &s;y&s;tems of theology. He was well acquainted with practical metaphy&s;icks. In reading travels he took great delight. From them, he drew a large fund or his knowledge of the natural hi&s;|tory of our globe. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed talents for mu&s;ic and poetry, but the more &s;erious and nece&s;|&s;ary pur&s;uits of his life, prevented his devoting much time to the cultivation of them. He read the Engli&s;h poets with great plea&s;ure. The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of Thom&s;on charmed him mo&s;t. He
<PB N="23" REF="031143_0022_0FEAC7781E83B8C8">
admired his elegant combination of philo&s;ophy and poetry. However oppo&s;ed the&s;e &s;tudies may appear, they alike derive their perfection from exten&s;ive and accurate ob&s;ervations of the works of nature. He was intimately acquainted with the French, German, and Dutch languages, the two former of which he acquired without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a ma&s;ter. They &s;erved the va|luable purpo&s;e of conveying to him the di&s;co|veries of foreign nations, and thereby enabled him to pro&s;ecute his &s;tudies with more advan|tage, in his native language.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of Mr. Rittenhou&s;e, it has been common to lament his want of what is called a liberal education.&mdash;Were education what it &s;hould be, in our public &s;eminaries, this would have been a misfortune, but conducted as it is at pre&s;ent, agreeably to the &s;y&s;tems adopted in Europe in the fifteenth century, I am di&s;po&s;ed to believe that his exten&s;ive knowledge, and &s;plendid character are to be a&s;cribed chiefly to his having e&s;caped the pernicious influence of monki&s;h learning upon his mind in early life. Had the u&s;ual forms of a public education in the United States been impo&s;ed upon him; in|&s;tead of revolving through life in a planetary orbit, he would probably have con&s;umed the
<PB N="24" REF="031143_0023_0FEAC77B51719768">
force of his genius by fluttering around the blaze of an evening taper. Rittenhou&s;e the Philo&s;o|pher, and one of the luminaries of the eighteenth century, might have &s;pent his hours of &s;tudy in compo&s;ing &s;yllogi&s;ms, or in mea&s;uring the feet of Greek and Latin poetry.</P>
<P>It will be honourable to the citizens of the United States, to add, that they were not in&s;en|&s;ible of the merit of our philo&s;opher. Inven|tions and improvements in every art and &s;cience, were frequently &s;ubmitted to his examination, and were afterwards patroni&s;ed by the public, according as they were approved of by him. Wherever he went, he met with public re&s;pect, and private attentions. But his reputation was not confined to his native country. His name was known and admired in every region of the earth, where &s;cience and genius are cultivated and re&s;pected.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The degree of Ma&s;ter of Arts was conferred upon him by the College of Philadelphia, in 1768.

<P>Such were the talents and knowledge, and &s;uch the fame, of our departed Pre&s;ident! His

We &s;hall now contemplate him at a le&s;s di&s;tance, and behold him in the familiar character of a man, fulfilling his various duties, in their utmo&s;t extent. If any thing has been &s;aid of his talents and know|ledge that has excited attention, or kindled de|&s;ires in the younger members of our &s;ociety, to pur&s;ue him in his path of honor, let me reque&s;t them not to for&s;ake me here. Come, and learn by his example, to be good, as well as great.&mdash; His virtues furni&s;h the mo&s;t &s;hining models for your imitation, for they were never ob&s;cured in any &s;ituation or &s;tage of his life, by a &s;ingle cloud of weakne&s;s or vice. As the &s;ource of the&s;e virtues, whether of a public or private na|ture, I &s;hall fir&s;t mention his exalted &s;en&s;e of moral obligation founded upon the revelation of the perfections of the Supreme Being. This appears from many pa&s;&s;ages in his oration, and from his private letters to his friends. In his oration we find the following pious &s;entiment. "Should it plea&s;e that Almighty Power who hath

placed us in a world in which we are only per|mitted "to look about us and to die," to indulge us with exi&s;tence throughout that half of eternity which &s;till remains un&s;pent, and to conduct us through the &s;everal &s;tages of his works, <HI>here</HI> [meaning in the &s;tudy of a&s;tronomy] is ample provi&s;ion made for employing every faculty of the mind, even allowing its powers to be enlarg|ed through an endle&s;s repetition of ages. Let us not complain of the vanity of this world, and that there is nothing in it capable of &s;atisfying us. Happy in tho&s;e wants,&mdash;happy in tho&s;e de&s;ires, forever in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to be gratified,&mdash;happy in a continual approach to the Deity."</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I am not one of tho&s;e &s;anguine &s;pirits who &s;eem to think that when the withered hand of death has drawn up the curtain of eternity, all di&s;tance between the creature and the Creator, and between finite and infinite, will be annihilated. Every enlarge|ment of our faculties,&mdash;every new happine&s;s conferred upon us, every &s;tep we advance to|wards the Divinity, will very probably render us more and more &s;en&s;ible of his inexhau&s;tible &s;tores of communicable bli&s;s, and of his inac|ce&s;&s;ible perfections."</P>
<P>There appears to be a natural connection between a knowledge of the works of nature and
<PB N="27" REF="031143_0026_0FEAC78550CC7210">
ju&s;t ideas of the divine perfections; and if phi|lo&s;ophers have not in all ages been equally de|vout with our Pre&s;ident, it becomes us to en|quire how far the beneficial influence of philo|&s;ophy upon religion, may have been prevented by their minds being pre-occupied in early life with the fictions of ancient poets, and the vices of the heathen gods. It remains yet to be de|termined, whether all the moral as well as natu|ral attributes of the Deity may not be di&s;covered in the form, and oeconomy of the material world, and whether that righteou&s;ne&s;s which de&s;cended from heaven near eighteen hundred years ago, may not wait for philo&s;ophical truth to &s;pring up from the earth, in order by uniting with it, to command univer&s;al belief and obedi|dience. This opinion, as far as it relates to one of the moral attributes of the Deity, &s;eems to have been admitted by our philo&s;opher in the following elegant and pious extract from a let|ter to one of his friends, "give me leave (&s;ays he) to mention two or three proofs of infinite goodne&s;s in the works of creation. The fir&s;t is, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing goodne&s;s in our&s;elves. Now it is incon&s;i&s;tent with all ju&s;t rea&s;oning to &s;uppo&s;e, that there is any thing good, lovely or prai&s;e-worthy in us, which is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in an in|finitely

higher degree by that Being who fir&s;t called us into exi&s;tence. In the next place, I reckon the exqui&s;ite and innocent delight that many things around us are calculated to afford us. In this light the beauty and fragrance of a &s;ingle ro&s;e is a better argument for divine good|ne&s;s than a luxuriant field of wheat. For if we can &s;uppo&s;e that we were created by a malevo|lent Being with a de&s;ign to torment us for his amu&s;ement, he mu&s;t have furni&s;hed us with the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and either have made our condition tolerable, or not have le&s;t the means of quitting it at plea&s;ure, in our own power. Such being my opinions, you will not wonder at my fondne&s;s for what Mr. Addi&s;on calls the plea&s;ures of the imagination. They are all to me, &s;o many demon&s;trations of infinite goodne&s;s."</P>
<P>If &s;uch be the pious fruits of an attentive examination of the works of the Creator, cea&s;e ye mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel to defeat the de&s;ign of your benevolent labors, by interpo&s;ing the common &s;tudies of the &s;chools, between our globe, and the minds of young people.

to in&s;truct them in the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the Creator, and let the effects of phy&s;ical evil upon general happine&s;s, vindicate the divine go|vernment, in permitting the exi&s;tence of moral evil in our world. Thus the perver&s;e pa&s;&s;ions of man, may be made to unite with &s;torms and tempe&s;ts, in furni&s;hing proofs of the goodne&s;s of the Creator of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>But the religion of Mr. Rittenhou&s;e, was not derived wholly from his knowledge and ad|miration of the material world. He believed in the Chri&s;tian revelation. Of this, he gave many proofs, not only in the conformity of his life, to the precepts of the go&s;pel, but in his letters and conver&s;ation. I well recollect in &s;peaking to me of the truth and excellency of the Chri&s;tian religion, he mentioned as a proof of its divine origin, that the miracles of our Saviour differed from all other miracles, in being entirely of a kind and benevolent nature. It is no &s;mall triumph to the friends of Revelation to ob&s;erve, in this age of infidelity, that our religion has been admitted and even defended by men of the mo&s;t exalted under&s;tanding, and of the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;oning powers.

It was the practice of the philo&s;ophers of former ages, to pa&s;s their lives in their clo&s;ets, and to maintain a formal and di&s;tant intercour&s;e with their families; but our philo&s;opher was a &s;tran|ger to pride and impo&s;ture in every thing. His family con&s;tituted his chief &s;ociety, and the mo&s;t intimate circle of his friends. When the de|clining &s;tate of his health, rendered the &s;oli|tude of his &s;tudy, le&s;s agreeable than in former years, he pa&s;&s;ed whole evenings in reading or conver&s;ing, with his wife and daughters. Hap|py family! &s;o much and &s;o long ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a head! and happier &s;till, to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed di&s;po&s;itions and knowledge to di&s;cern and love his exalted character, and to enjoy his in&s;truct|ing

conver&s;ation!&mdash;Thus &s;ir Thomas Moore lived with his accompli&s;hed wife and daughters; &mdash;Thus Cicero educated his beloved Tullia; and in this way only, can the female &s;ex be el|evated to that dignity, and u&s;efulne&s;s in &s;ocie|ty, for which they were formed, and by which, from their influence upon manners, a new aera would be created in the hi&s;tory of mankind.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e, and manner of living, of our pre&s;ident, exhibited the ta&s;te of a philo&s;opher, the &s;implicity of a republican, and the temper of a Chri&s;tian. He was independent, and content|ed with an e&s;tate, &s;mall in the e&s;timation of am|bition and avarice, but amply &s;uited to all his wants and de&s;ires. He held the office of trea|&s;urer of Penn&s;ylvania, by an annual and unani|mous vote of the legi&s;lature, between the years 1777, and 1789. During this period, he de|clined purcha&s;ing the &s;malle&s;t portion of the public debt of the &s;tate, thereby manife&s;ting a delicacy of integrity, which is known and felt only by pure and elevated minds.</P>
<P>In the year 1792, he was per&s;uaded to ac|cept of the office of Director of the mint of the United States. His want of health, obliged him to re&s;ign it in 1795. Here his conduct was likewi&s;e above &s;u&s;picion, for I have been inform+ed
<PB N="40" REF="031143_0039_0FEAC7AA669A2BF0">
by his colleague in office,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Way.</NOTE> that in &s;everal in|&s;tances, he paid for work done at the mint out of his &s;alary, where he thought the charges for it, would be deemed extravagant by the United States.</P>
<P>His oeconomy extended to a wi&s;e and profitable u&s;e of his time. No man ever found him unemployed. As an apology for detaining a friend a few minutes, while he arranged &s;ome papers he had been examining, he &s;aid, "that he had once thought health, the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing in the world, but that he now thought there was one thing of much greater value, and that was time." The propriety of this remark will appear when we con&s;ider, that Providence, &s;o liberal in other gifts, be&s;tows this, in a &s;par|ing manner. He never gives a &s;econd moment, until he has withdrawn the fir&s;t, and &s;till re&s;erves the third in his own hand.</P>
<P>The countenance of Mr. Rittenhou&s;e, was too remarkable to be unnoticed upon this occa|&s;ion. It di&s;played &s;uch a mixture of contempla|tion, benignity, and innocence, that it was ea|&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h his per&s;on in the large&s;t com|pany, by a previous knowledge of his character. His manners were civil, and engaging to &s;uch a
<PB N="41" REF="031143_0040_0FEAC7AD63DC2D00">
degree, that he &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed an hour, even in a public hou&s;e, in travelling through our coun|try, without being followed by the good wi&s;hes of all who attended upon him. There was no affectation of &s;ingularity, in any thing he &s;aid, or did. Even his hand writing, in which this weakne&s;s &s;o frequently di&s;covers it&s;elf, was &s;im|ple and intelligible at fir&s;t &s;ight, to all who &s;aw it.</P>
<P>Here I expected to have fini&s;hed the detail of his virtues, but in the neighbourhood of that galaxy created by their connected lu&s;tre, I be|hold a virtue of ine&s;timable value, twinkling like a rare, and &s;olitary &s;tar. It is his &s;uperlative mode&s;ty. This heaven born virtue was &s;o con|&s;picuous in every part of his conduct, that he appeared not &s;o much to conceal, as to be igno|rant of his &s;uperiority as a philo&s;opher and a man, over the greate&s;t part of his fellow-crea|tures.</P>
<P>In reviewing the intellectual endowments and moral excellency of Mr. Rittenhou&s;e, and our late intimate connection with him, we are led to rejoice in being men.</P>
<P>We proceed now to the clo&s;ing &s;cenes of his life.</P>
<P>His con&s;titution was naturally feeble, but it was rendered &s;till more &s;o, by &s;edentary la|bour,
<PB N="42" REF="031143_0041_0FEAC7B1EA952368">
and midnight &s;tudies. He was afflicted for many years with a weak brea&s;t, which, upon unu&s;ual exertions of body or mind, or &s;udden changes in the weather, became the &s;eat of a painful and harra&s;&s;ing di&s;order. This con&s;titu|tional infirmity was not without its u&s;es. It con|tributed much to the perfection of his virtue, by producing habitual patience and re&s;ignation to the will of heaven, and a con&s;tant eye to the hour of his di&s;&s;olution. It was a window through which he often looked with plea&s;ure towards a place of exi&s;tence, where from the encrea&s;e and perfection of his intuitive faculties, he would probably acquire more knowledge in an hour, than he had acquired in his whole life, by the &s;low operations of rea&s;on; and where, from the greater magnitude and extent of the objects of his contemplation, his native globe, would appear like his cradle, and all the events of time, like the amu&s;ements of his infant years.</P>
<P>On the 26th of June, of the pre&s;ent year, the long expected me&s;&s;enger of death, di&s;clo&s;ed his commi&s;&s;ion. In his la&s;t illne&s;s, which was acute, and &s;hort, he retained the u&s;ual patience and benevolence of his temper. Upon being told that &s;ome of his friends had called at his door to inquire how he was; he
<PB N="43" REF="031143_0042_0FEAC7B36DEE3978">
a&s;ked why they were not invited into his cham|ber to &s;ee him. "Becau&s;e (&s;aid his wife) you are too weak to &s;peak to them." "Yes (&s;aid he) that is true, but I could &s;till have &s;queezed their hands."&mdash;Thus with a heart overflowing with love to his family, friends, country, and to the whole world, he peacefully re&s;igned his &s;pirit into the hands of his God. Let the day of his death be recorded in the annals of our &s;o|ciety, and let its annual return be marked by &s;ome public act, which &s;hall characteri&s;e his &s;ervices and our grief, and thereby animate us and our &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, to imitate his illu&s;trious ex|ample!</P>
<P>It has been the fa&s;hion of late years, to &s;ay of per&s;ons who had been di&s;tingui&s;hed in life, when they left the world in a &s;tate of indiffer|ence to every thing, and believing, and hoping in nothing, that they died like philo&s;ophers. Very different was the latter end of our excel|lent pre&s;ident. He died like a chri&s;tian, inte|re&s;ted in the welfare of all around him&mdash;believ|ing in the re&s;urrection, and the life to come, and hoping for happine&s;s from every attribute of the Deity.</P>
<P>Agreeably to his reque&s;t, his body was in|terred in his ob&s;ervatory near his dwelling
<PB N="44" REF="031143_0043_0FEAC7B6C63E4828">
hou&s;e, in the pre&s;ence of a numerous concour&s;e of his fellow-citizens. It was natural for him in the near pro&s;pect of appearing in the pre|&s;ence of his Maker, to feel an attachment to that &s;pot in which he had cultivated a know|ledge of his perfections, and held communion with him through the medium of his works. Hereafter it &s;hall become one of the objects of curio&s;ity in our city. Thither &s;hall the plilo&s;o|phers of future ages re&s;ort to do homage to his tomb, and children yet unborn, &s;hall point to the dome which covers it, and exultlngly &s;ay, "there lies our Rittenhou&s;e."</P>
<P>Let us my re&s;pected colleagues, repair for a few minutes to that awful &s;pot.&mdash;In entering it, &mdash;we behold the tele&s;cope, dear in&s;trument of his di&s;coveries, turned upon its axis, and point|ed to the earth, which has clo&s;ed its ma&s;ter's eyes.&mdash;How artle&s;s&mdash;the in&s;cription upon his tomb&s;tone!&mdash;It contains nothing but his name, and the &s;imple record of the days and years of his birth and death.&mdash;Very different would have been the monument of his worth and fame, had not the gratitude and affection of his friends been controuled by his dying reque&s;t. His head would have reclined in marble, upon the lap of religion. At his feet, &s;cience would have &s;at&mdash;
<PB N="45" REF="031143_0044_0FEAC7C11CF423D0">
bathed in tears; while the genius of republican liberty, in the figure of a venerable hermit, bending over his grave, would have deplored the lo&s;s of his favorite &s;on.&mdash;Alas!&mdash;too&mdash;too &s;oon has our beloved pre&s;ident been torn from the chair of our &s;ociety!&mdash;Too &s;oon has he laid a&s;ide his robes of office, and cea&s;ed to mini&s;ter for us day and night at the altar of &s;cience!&mdash; Ah!&mdash;who now will elevate his tele&s;cope, and again direct it towards yonder heavens? Who now will ob&s;erve the tran&s;it of the planets? Who now will awaken our nation to view the trackle&s;s and &s;tupendous comet? Who now will mea&s;ure the cour&s;es of our rivers, in order to convey their &s;treams into our city, for the purpo&s;es of health and commerce?&mdash;Na|ture is dumb;&mdash;for the voice of her chief interpreter is hu&s;hed in death.&mdash;In this hour of our bereavement, to whom &s;hall we look?&mdash;but to THEE, FATHER of life and light:&mdash;thou author of great and good gifts to man. O! let not thy Sun, thy Moon, and thy Stars now &s;hine unob&s;erved among us! may the genius of our departed pre&s;ident, like the mantle of thy prophet of old, de&s;cend upon &s;ome mem|ber
<PB N="46" REF="031143_0045_0FEAC7BE1B3D30B8">
of our &s;ociety, who &s;hall, as he did, ex|plain to us the my&s;teries of thy works, and lead us &s;tep by &s;tep, to THYSELF, the great over|flowing fountain of wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s and mer|cy, to the children of men!</P>
