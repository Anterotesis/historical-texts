<Q>IS there no Balm in Gilead? is there no Phy&s;i|cian there? Why then is not the Health of the Daughter of my People recovered.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THIS is a Day of the Gladne&s;s of our Heart, on Account of that great and comprehen&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ing of FREEDOM, which <HI>now,</HI> in a peculiar manner, ex|ect it&s;elf, animating all the Members of Society and &s;miling in every Countenance, While LIBERTY &s;tretches forth her Hand, without Controul, to give her Suffiages for Men <HI>to rule us in the Fear of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>WE al&s;o Sing of Mercy, in the gracious &s;miles of Providence upon the important undertakings of our Hands. Our Work and our Warfare are crowned with remarkable Succe&s;s. <HI>The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.</HI></P>
<P>AND under all the&s;e temporal Advantages, we are <HI>ble&s;s'd with</HI> numberle&s;s <HI>&s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="008598_0005_102F94855DDB43C8">
<HI>in heavenly Places in CHRIST.</HI> Our Eyes be|hold our Teachers, and <HI>our Ears hear the joyful Sound.</HI> All which are Arguments of Prai&s;e; and hopeful Symptoms of a healthy State.</P>
<P>IT may therefore &s;eem a little grating, at &s;uch a Time, to hear of <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> and <HI>Medicines,</HI> implying <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es, Wounds</HI> and <HI>Brui&s;es,</HI> that in|danger the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e.

What Tokens of Sickne&s;s or Danger does the Preacher di&s;cover, in the Daughter of Zion, who&s;e Countenance looks &s;o fair and flou|ri&s;hing?</P>
<P>THE An&s;wer is obvious: they appear in our ungrateful Returns to the Father of Mercy's for all his Benefits unto us. We are highly exalted, on account of Privileges:&mdash;flu&s;h'd with Succe&s;|&s;es pa&s;t, and confident of more to come; whil&s;t <HI>we are laden with Iniquity</HI> and wrapped up in Security.</P>
<P>OUR Ca&s;e too nearly re&s;embles <HI>that</HI> of the Jews, in the Days of our Prophet. They were GOD's peculiar People: and he had long in|dulged them as Children: <HI>fed them to the full,</HI> with every Kind of Ble&s;&s;ing. But, in return, they filled Jeru&s;alem, the holy City, with their Abominations: &s;uch as Adultery, Uncleanne&s;s, Idolatry, Oppre&s;&s;ion, Murder and Blood: all which cry'd for Vengeance.</P>
<P>KING <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> did every thing, that became a pious Prince to reform them. <HI>He turned to</HI>

<P>UPON <HI>Jo&s;iah's</HI> Death, they bid Defiance to Heaven, and returned to their former Wicked|ne&s;s, <HI>like the Dog to his Vomit.</HI> Jeremiah repro|ved them, and &s;olemnly warned them of their Danger.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. 4. 20.</NOTE> <HI>De&s;truction upon De&s;truction is cried, for the whole Land is &s;poiled:</HI> A&s;&s;uring them of Protection, upon their Amendment.</P>

<P>MOV'D with Pity at the Sight of his guilty People, in&s;en&s;ible of their Danger, on the Bor|ders of De&s;truction, the holy Prophet lamented over them, and gave his Sorrows vent in the&s;e pathetick Strains.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Cont. ver. 18,&mdash;21.</NOTE> <HI>When I would comfort my &s;elf again&s;t &s;orrow, my heart is faint in me.

<HI>and we are not &s;aved. For the hurt of the daugh|ter of my People am I hurt.</HI> It is for my Coun|try, and e&s;pecially for the Church of God, that I am thus deeply affected.

Fir&s;t, <HI>I am to &s;how, what Di&s;ea&s;es or evil Habits are imminently dangerous, threatning De|&s;truction to a People.</HI> They are &s;uch as the&s;e,</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>A Selfi&s;h Spirit, or the prevalence of Self Love.</HI> This pernicious Principle, took place with our original Defection from God. When Man for &s;ook the Lord, he lo&s;t &s;ight of the only Ob|ject of his Happine&s;s, retired into <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> and made <HI>him&s;elf</HI> the Object of his Love, and the Centre of all his De&s;ires and Actions. And if &s;o, the Principle of Self Love, bears a univer&s;al &s;way, exerci&s;ing Dominion over all the humane Race, until renewed by the Grace of God, and directed by his holy Spirit. But le&s;t we mi&s;take the Principle, &amp; call Good, Evil; let us attend to our Saviour's Teaching; upon the head of Self Love, Mat. 22. 39. <HI>Thou &s;hall love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf.</HI> So then, we may and ought <HI>to love our&s;elves.</HI> Our Lord allows of it, or takes it for granted. This is a Prin|ciple founded in humane Nature: not to be rooted out, but refined&punc; by the Grace of God. And &s;o is not, &s;imply con&s;idered, any Fault or Di&s;ea&s;e. But then; remember thou ha&s;t a Neighbour, that thou art related to Society; the Bond of which is Love. And therefore, thou &s;hall love thy <HI>Neighbour,</HI> as well as <HI>thy &s;elf.</HI> Which &s;eems plainly to intimate, that our Lord does not here &s;peak of loving <HI>our &s;elves</HI> merely as <HI>individual,</HI> made to dwell alone; but as we &s;tand connected with our fellow-men, as Mem|bers
<PB N="11" REF="008598_0010_102F949C06319628">
of a public Body, or Community, who&s;e Happine&s;s he would have us promote, with the warme&s;t Intention. And as Love is productive of every kind Office, therefore con&s;ider, how thou love&s;t <HI>thy &s;elf.</HI> Sincerely,&mdash;fervently,&mdash;in|variably,&mdash;and then go and do likewi&s;e to thy Neighbour: not only to <HI>One</HI> but <HI>All.</HI> Love all the Members of that Body, of which thou al&s;o art a Member. This is due to the Public. And here is the Rule or Mea&s;ure, by which thou art to render to thy Neighbour his Due. <HI>Love him as thy &s;elf.</HI> So that <HI>Love</HI> is a &s;ocial Grace, planted in the humane Soul, not merely for our <HI>own</HI> Happine&s;s, but for the good of <HI>others</HI> al&s;o. But when a Man views him&s;elf, as an Individual Only, and not as a Member of Society; and thereupon con&s;ults nothing but his Own per&s;o|nal Intere&s;t, not regarding the Intere&s;t of the Body: or if he lends his A&s;&s;i&s;tance to his Neigh|bour, it is with this ultimate View, that <HI>him&s;elf</HI> alone may finally reap the Advantage. Such a Man is guilty of that criminal <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s</HI> which I here &s;peak of. And this is a mo&s;t dangerous Di&s;ea&s;e, threatning De&s;truction to the People where it reigns. The Apo&s;tle to <HI>Timothy,</HI> &s;peaks of it, as &s;uch 2 Tim. 3. 1, 2. In the la&s;t days <HI>peri|lous Times</HI> &s;hall come; for Men &s;hall <HI>be Lovers of their Own &s;elves.</HI> The&s;e are perilous Times indeed, when the generality of Men living up|on Earth, &s;hall be left to the Power of <HI>&s;elf love;</HI> forgetting their Relation to the Body, &s;hall every

A moments Attention to the actings of this narrow, fordid Principle&punc; will di&s;cover the Danger of it. For they that are actuated by &s;uch a Spirit, have this only Ob|ject in View, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>their own per&s;onal Intere&s;t;</HI> not as it is included in the public, or common good, but as &s;eperate from it. And according|ly the Schemes they Project and the Mea&s;ures they Pur&s;ue, are from the &s;ome Principle, and for the &s;ame End, even <HI>&s;elf Intere&s;t.</HI> Now, let us View all the Members of a Body, or Society, (and why not <HI>One</HI> as well as <HI>another,</HI> and <HI>all</HI> as well as <HI>One,</HI>) influenced by this &s;elfi&s;h Prin|ciple, and &s;ee what dreadful work they will make. For their Intere&s;t being oppo&s;ite to each Other, (which mu&s;t be the Ca&s;e, on the pre&s;ent Hypothe&s;is,) it follows, that there will be a per|petual cla&s;hing, among Individuals, in their re|&s;pective Mea&s;ures and Means, to attain their private Ends, (for the Intere&s;t of One is the In|jury of another, where &s;elf reigns,) and then, all their Mea&s;ures will interfere with the public Intere&s;t: for <HI>this</HI> they have all agreed to &s;acri|fice to <HI>&s;elf.</HI> What then becomes of the Com|munity? that Body of People which were united

For, by promoting him|&s;elf, to the injury of the Public, he &s;en&s;ibly weakens the hands of that Body, yea di&s;arms it or all its Power, (as far as <HI>he</HI> is of any con&s;e|quence&punc;) and &s;o deprives him&s;elf of that pro|tection and &s;trength, which the Community, had he not di&s;&s;olv'd its Bonds, would have exerted to his Defence, in a time of extremity, which <HI>he</HI> as an Individual, can no longer avoid nor endure.

<P N="2">2 <HI>A party &s;pirit is a dangerous Evil.</HI> This originates from &s;elf, or is only the &s;ame &s;pirit, acting in a different form and carrying a wider breadth. But then, every Sect or Party of Men, profe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame Opinion, ought not to be look'd upon, as <HI>Party &s;pirited,</HI> in any bad &s;en&s;e, <HI>merely</HI> for their uniting in &s;entiments, that differ from the re&s;t, or other part of the Commu|nity. For, every Man has a natural, unalienable
<PB N="14" REF="008598_0013_102F94A5F5510470">
Right to think and &s;ee for him&s;elf. And if he is con&s;cientious, he will be at Pains to find out Truth: which having found, to his &s;atisfaction, mu&s;t be dear to him. He therefore with his Brethren of the &s;ame Opinion, ought, as hone&s;t Men, to be zealous for tho&s;e Truths, in propor|tion to the Importance of them. Sects or Par|ties, in this Sence, as they are unavoidable, &s;o they may not be hurtful to the Body. They don't threaten the public &s;afety, provided all Parties duely con&s;ider them&s;elves as equally re|lated to the Public; and do tenderly affect one another as Parts and Members of the &s;ame Body; holding up the public Health in con&s;tant View, as a Matter of the highe&s;t Importance, and the End of all their Pur&s;uits. Such a gene|rous Spirit as this, which is no ways incon&s;i&s;tent with Parties, &s;imply con&s;idered, will &s;ecure the public good, and, at the &s;ame time, the Peace and &s;afety of all Parties and Individuals. But when a Party or Number of Men, unite to carry on a particular De&s;ign, either without any Regard to the public Health, or unhappy mi&s;taking <HI>them&s;elves</HI> for the <HI>Public,</HI> and thence concluding that nothing is of general Benefit but what favours <HI>their</HI> party-Intere&s;t: In con&s;equence of which their Strength and Zeal is put forth in promo|ting, not the real good of the Public, but of their own Party, to the cru&s;hing of their di&s;&s;enting Brethren, as if they were not Members in com|mon of the &s;ame Body, This, I apprehend is to
<PB N="15" REF="008598_0014_102F94A9184397F8">
be <HI>Party Spirited</HI> in an evil Sen&s;e, and is of mo&s;t pernicious Con&s;equence. This affords continual Matter for the working of Envy, Ma|lice and Bitterne&s;s, the Fruit of which is Di&s;|cord, Strife and Divi&s;ions which give the mo&s;t fatal Wounds to the Common Wealth. This is for a Hou&s;e or Kingdom to be divided again&s;t it&s;elf, which our Lord a&s;&s;ures us can|not &s;tand.</P>
<P>WHEN Parties are actuated by &s;uch a narrow, contracted Spirit, each of them pur&s;uing their re&s;pective Intere&s;ts, &s;eparate from the public Good, and regardle&s;s of its Fate, their Conduct is as unnatural and tends as directly to the De|&s;truction of a People, as if the Fingers of the Right Hand &s;hould militate again&s;t tho&s;e of the Left; and <HI>both Hands,</HI> in their zealous &s;trife, neglect the Defence of the Body, when a drawn Sword is pointed at the Heart.</P>
<P>SHOULD any plead, that the Con&s;titution is weak, the Government bad, and the Rulers ty|rannical, all this wont legitimate a party Spirit, nor ju&s;tify its ruling, &s;o long as there is <HI>a pub|lic, common Good;</HI> upon the &s;ecuring of which, the <HI>&s;afety</HI> of Individuals, under &s;uch a Govern|ment, may be obtained.</P>
<P>THE holy Religion, that GOD has taught his People, is of &s;uch a generous Temper, that it not only forbids their touching the public Peace, but requires them to &s;eek and promote it (even under an <HI>idolatrous and tyrannical Ma|gi&s;trate.</HI>

<PB N="32" REF="008598_0031_102F94DD73854138">
handled upon this Occa&s;ion: and the Nece&s;&s;ity of it, e&s;pecially in our lap&s;ed &s;tate, &s;o well &s;up|ported, that I need do no more than mention it. And from hence it appears, that every Mem|ber of this important Body, &s;hould hold him&s;elf Obliged to put on a Public Spirit, and to exert him&s;elf, upon all Occa&s;ions, to promote its Welfare. For the Safety and Welfare of the Public, is, not only his Own, out his Neigh|bours, his Friends, his Childrens. In that there is &s;uch a clo&s;e Connection between the Body and its Members, that if the Body be well or &s;ick, the Members mu&s;t be proportionably affected. Now, let the Regard which we have, or <HI>&s;hould</HI> have for our Neighbours Welfare, be added to that which we have for our <HI>Own,</HI> and the Ar|gument, for a public &s;pirit, will be doubly &s;trong. And will yet gather &s;trength, when we View e|very Individual, of the whole Body, happy or mi&s;erable, according as it fares with the Public. So that a true Lover of Mankind, will prefer the public Good and Safety, above his <HI>Own,</HI> per&s;onally and &s;eparately con&s;idered, as much as the whole Body is preferable to any one of its Members. And <HI>this</HI> not only ju&s;tifies, but in&s;pirits a truly generous Soul, a real Friend of the Public, to &s;acrifice, not only his own <HI>Ea&s;e</HI> and <HI>Profit,</HI> but his <HI>Life</HI> to his Country's Service; when the &s;afety, or welfare of the Community demands it of him. As it was with Noah, in the Time of the Flood,&mdash;the Safety &amp; Well Being
<PB N="33" REF="008598_0032_102F94DF0BE0D138">
of <HI>Noah,</HI> his Family and of every living Crea|ture that was with him, depended upon the Pre|&s;ervation of the <HI>Ark.</HI> If <HI>that</HI> was kept above Water, entire and in a due Po&s;ition; they were all &s;afe: If it &s;unk, or was da&s;h'd in pieces, by the Waves; they all peri&s;hed: Therefore the Pre&s;ervation of the Ark was of greater Impor|tance, and, very ju&s;tly, a Matter of deeper Con|cern with every Member of the Family, than barely the Pre&s;ervation of <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> as &s;eparate from the Ark.&mdash;So in the Ca&s;e before us: Our whole Intere&s;t and Safety is embarked in the Public Welfare. And therefore that the Pub|lic may be pre&s;erved &s;afe, in Health &amp; Pro&s;pe|rity, is a Matter of &s;uch Va&s;t Importance, as ju&s;tly demands the fir&s;t Concern of every incor|porated Member.&mdash;But then, the higher any Ones Station is in the Body; the larger is his Sphere of Action; the more numerous are the Branches of his Duty, and the more exten&s;ive is his Influence. So that his Opportunities and Advantages to do good, are in Proportion to the Place he &s;u&s;tains: And on the Other hand, his Failure of Duty, mu&s;t be proportionably hurtful to the Public, as his Station is higher than his Brethrens. Which &s;hows, that from the Head of a Nation or Province, down to the Ma&s;ter of a Family, our Concern for the Public Good &s;hould ri&s;e according to the Place which we Occupy.
