<P>IT is ob&s;erved by the Learned, that in the earlie&s;t Ages of the World, tho&s;e who had the greate&s;t Authority Civil, had likewi&s;e the Sacred conjoyned with it: That as Civil Society's are no other than a Combination of particular Family's, &s;o before Family's a&s;&s;ociated into tho&s;e larger Society's, the Ma&s;ter of the Fa|mily was the Prie&s;t of it.</P>
<P>And that hence it is that we read of <HI>Noah, Jacob</HI> and <HI>Job,</HI> that they Sacrificed; and of <HI>Abraham'</HI>s In&s;tructing his Family. Every Head of a Family was both King and Prie&s;t in his Hou&s;e, and performed the re&s;pective Functions belonging to each. Afterward (as mo&s;t conceive) the Fir&s;t-born in Family's had the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Prie&s;thood, and were

exerci&s;ed in it till the giving of the Law. To Confirm which Opinion, that Text (with &s;ome others) is alledged; which we have, Numb. 3. 11, 12. <HI>And the Lord &s;pake unto</HI> Mo&s;es, <HI>&s;aying, And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the Children of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>in&s;tead of all the Fir&s;t-born that openeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> among the Children of</HI> I&s;rael: <HI>therefo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">vites &s;hall be mine.</HI> Where we find God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Levites from among the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> in&s;tead of the Fir&s;t-born. But whether this was &s;o or not, yet mo&s;t certain it is, that the Civil and Sacred Powers were united in the &s;ame Per|&s;ons; and that not only in the Morning of the World, before Family's (for mutual advan|tages) a&s;&s;ociated together; but we have in|&s;tances of it al&s;o afterward, even till by Po&s;i|tive Laws the power of the Prie&s;thood was re|&s;trained to the Tribe of <HI>Levi.</HI> Thus (as the Sacred Oracles inform us) <HI>Melchi&s;edeck</HI> was both King and Prie&s;t in <HI>Salem;</HI> and upon the acount of his two-fold Office (as well as in other re&s;pects) was an Eminent Type of Chri&s;t, <HI>who is a Prie&s;t upon a Throne.</HI> So we find <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> (in like manner) exerci&s;ing both the&s;e Powers, till <HI>Aaron</HI> and his Sons were Con&s;ecrated to the latter of them, <HI>Exod.</HI> 24. 5. <HI>&amp;</HI> 29. 35.

the <HI>Gentile</HI> World (after the di&s;per&s;ion) as there were Sacrifices and other Solemnity's of Sacred e&s;timation, attended in Honour of their Gods, &s;o the Power of the Prie&s;thood was often po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e of Royal Dignity among them. Profane Story furni&s;hes us with in&s;tances of this nature; particularly a|mong the <HI>Egyptians, Lacaedemonians</HI> &amp; <HI>Romans,</HI> divers of who&s;e Emperors (even after the&s;e Powers were &s;eparated among them) are &s;aid to retain the Title of <HI>Pontifex Maximus,</HI> a|mong the re&s;t of their Imperial Honours.</P>
<P>Tis not to be doubted, but that the exerci&s;e of the&s;e two Offices by tho&s;e holy Per&s;ons of old, was very agreeable to the mind of God. As for <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> what he did in either of them, was by expre&s;s Warrant from God: And altho' we find not the like as to others, yet there is no rea&s;on to doubt, but they acted by a like Divine Authority therein.</P>
<P>Now this Union of the&s;e two Powers in the &s;ame Per&s;ons in tho&s;e Ages of the World, as its otherwi&s;e In&s;tructive, &s;o particularly it Sug|ge&s;ts to us the Mutual Serviceablene&s;s of Ci|vil Government and Religion each to other. Civil Government duly Admini&s;tred, contri|butes not a little to the Well-being, Growth &amp; Progre&s;s of Religion in Society's; and this on the other hand, is highly conducive to the due and &s;ucce&s;sful Admini&s;tration of Civil

Government. Of &s;uch importance is Reli|gion to the&s;e ends, that where it is not, there is little rea&s;on to hope for or expect them. In this ca&s;e, as Government is not likely to be duly Admini&s;tred, &s;o neither to be attended with Succe&s;s in its Admini&s;trations: Religion being as nece&s;&s;ary to a due Ob&s;ervance of Good Laws, as to the Making and due Execu|tion of them.</P>
<P>So depraved is the Nature of Man in his fallen State, and &s;uch is the mighty Power &amp; Influence of Sin in him, that where the Pow|erful influences &amp; re&s;traints of Religion are wanting, there is little rea&s;on to hope that either Rulers or Ruled, will adorn their Places by a due di&s;charge of the Duty's of either of them. <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;eems to have been very &s;en&s;ible of the truth of this, when he reply's to <HI>Abimelech,</HI> as in our Text; <HI>Be|cau&s;e I thought, Surely the Fear of God is not in this Place; and they will Slay me,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Ver&s;e of this Chapter, we have an account of <HI>Abraham'</HI>s remove from <HI>Mamre</HI> to <HI>Gerar; And</HI> Abraham <HI>journey'd from thence toward the</HI> South-<HI>countrey, and dwelled between</HI> Kade&s;h &amp; Shur, <HI>and &s;ojourned in</HI> Gerar.

From which Text (with &s;ome o|thers) I may ob&s;erve to you by the way, its inferred by &s;ome; That the true Notion of a Prophet, lies not in foretelling future events, but in declaring &amp; interpreting to the World the Mind of God received by immediate Re|velation from Him: That a Per&s;ons receiving that which he makes known to others by im|mediate Revelation from God, is that which formally Con&s;titutes a Prophet; and that its wholly extrin&s;ecal what time his Prophe&s;y re&s;pects, whether that which is pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, or to come: And that therefore <HI>Abraham</HI> here has this Title given to him; and he with <HI>I&s;aac</HI> &amp; <HI>Jacob</HI> are called Prophets, P&s;al. 105. 15. <HI>Touch not mine Anointed, &amp; do my Prophets no harm.</HI> Not becau&s;e of any Predictions uttered by them, but becau&s;e of the frequency of imme|diate

<P><HI>Abimelech</HI> being thus admoni&s;hed of God, and acquainted that <HI>Sarah</HI> was the Wife of <HI>A|braham,</HI> re&s;olves to re&s;tore her; &s;ends for <HI>A|braham</HI> and Expo&s;tulates with him, for his &s;o dealing with him, <HI>ver.</HI> 9, 10.

<P N="2">2.

<P N="1">1. Of the <HI>Act:</HI> Which is here put (as it el&s;ewhere is in Scripture) for the whole of Religion. <HI>Eccl.</HI> 12. 13. The Fear of God be|ing not only in it &s;elf an Eminent part of Religion; but al&s;o a Grace that has a peculiar influence upon all other parts of it, is not un|fitly put for the whole of it.

<P><PB N="9" REF="001598_0010_0FB3E7FFCCEDF790">
The Term [<HI>Religion</HI>] in our Doctrine, is wont to be variou&s;ly apply'd &amp; taken: Some|times Subjectively, for the internal Princi|ples and Acts of it: Sometimes Objectively, for the Word of God, or Rule of Religion: Sometimes for the particular Form or Man|ner of Wor&s;hip in Society's: Tis to be un|der&s;tood here in the former of the&s;e Accep|tations. And in this &s;en&s;e, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary is it to the&s;e ends, that where it is wanting (even in Society's that are otherwi&s;e under the be&s;t Regulations) there is little rea&s;on to hope that either Government &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ely Admini&s;tred, or any of the ends of it Obtained: That good Order, Peace, Tran|quility &s;hould flouri&s;h in them.</P>
<P>That Religion (in general) is very Ser|viceable to the de&s;igns of Government, &s;eems to be a Principle which Nature furni&s;hes men withal. Hence we find, that tho&s;e who in former Ages have introduced particular Forms of Government among the&s;e &amp; tho&s;e in the <HI>Gentile</HI> World, have therewith been careful to introduce Religion likewi&s;e. Thus tho&s;e fa|mous Law-givers, <HI>Hormes, Solon, Lycurgus, Numa,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And mo&s;t certain it is, that of &s;uch advan|tage to the de&s;igns of Government, was even the <HI>Pagan</HI> Religion in many Places, that

an <HI>Heathen</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plutarch.</HI></NOTE> could make this <HI>Remark,</HI> viz. <HI>That Religion is a Foundation that limits and joyns So|ciety's together.</HI> And again; <HI>That it is as im|po&s;&s;ible for a Common-Wealth to Sub&s;i&s;t without Re|ligion, as a City without Foundations.</HI> But what Virtue &s;oever it might have this way, yet cer|tain it is, that as none of the Vanity's of the <HI>Heathen</HI> may compare with the true GOD; &s;o neither, the Influences of their Abomina|tions, with tho&s;e of the true Religion in this point.</P>
<P>He that rightly Con&s;iders this, and withal the Influences of it upon the Minds of men, will &s;oon be convinc'd of this, and &s;ay, That nothing is equally Serviceable with this to promote the&s;e Ends: And that this of all things mo&s;t powerfully Obliges men to act in a due ob&s;ervance of the &s;everal Obligations they lie under to God, them&s;elves, and one another. In a word; What was wont to be &s;aid of the imaginary Soul of the World, may be &s;aid of true Religion in Society's, it ty's each part to it &s;elf, and one to another; and di&s;po&s;es of every thing for the good and advantage of the Whole. And this truth is in part at la&s;t Confe&s;&s;ed by the greate&s;t E|nemy's of it, when they tell us of Religion (Objectively taken,) that its a thing of Hu|mane

Original, the Politick Device of Princes the better to awe and keep their Subjects in Obedience: Which altho' it be a mo&s;t unju&s;t Imputation upon it, yet &s;uppo&s;es the Truth now a&s;&s;erted. And accordingly, this and all other means proper to Maintain, Secure and Advance it, are wont to be Commended (by the greate&s;t Ma&s;ters of Civil Policy) to the particular Care and Regard of Society's, as things which are likely to be fruitful in the be&s;t Con&s;equents.</P>
<P>There are Two <HI>Propo&s;itions,</HI> the one &s;uppo|&s;ed, the other expre&s;s'd in the <HI>Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>Tis &s;uppo&s;ed, that Religion is not of the E&s;&s;ence of Civil Government: Or that Civil Government may be in Society's</HI> (in &s;ome &s;ort at lea&s;t) <HI>without it.</HI> It is ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h, between Government in the ab&s;tracted Noti|on of it, and the due Con&s;titution, regular Succe&s;sful Exerci&s;e or Admini&s;tration of it. The difference between the&s;e is very great, and the Propo&s;ition intends the former; not the latter. Religion is not E&s;&s;ential to con|vey to Per&s;ons a right to Rule; [Dominion is not founded in Grace] nor yet to the Di&s;|charge of the Material part of the Duty's, either of the Ruler or the Ruled. The&s;e two, <HI>viz.</HI> Religion, and Government in Soci|ety's, tho' they are very E&s;&s;ential, &amp; highly

Contribute to the Well-being each of other, yet are not &s;o in&s;eparably Connected, that we may &s;ay of them as of Relates, <HI>That they take each other; and can in no wi&s;e Sub&s;i&s;t alone.</HI> The&s;e things are not only mentally &s;eparable, but really &amp; in fact are &s;o. But this by the way.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>Tho' this be &s;o, yet Religion is not only Con&s;i&s;tent with, but highly Serviceable to ad|vance the due and &s;ucce&s;sful Exerci&s;e of Govern|ment.</HI> There are different Forms of Govern|ment, &amp; various Modifications of the&s;e Forms, wherein the Power of Rulers is laid under different Limitations or Re&s;traints, and the Liberty or Priviledge of the Ruled various in Degree. Moreover, There are various Or|ders or Ranks of Per&s;ons in the Seat of Go|vernment: Some acting in an higher, others in a lower Sphere, having different Titles &amp; Powers annex'd to them. But whatever Form of Government may be in any Society's, and however Regulated, &amp; whatever Orders or Ranks of Per&s;ons may be Employ'd in the Admini&s;tration of Rule in them, (be they Supream or Subordinate) yet Religion is of the la&s;t Con&s;equence to the&s;e Ends.</P>
<P>Agreeably to this, the Wi&s;dom of Chri&s;tian Nations has always directed them to &s;hew particular Regard to this, Countenance and Encourage it, and all proper Methods for the

Propagation of it; and this as for other rea|&s;ons, &s;o particularly becau&s;e of its benign in|fluences upon the Civil Concerns of all So|ciety's.</P>
<P>Under this <HI>Propo&s;ition,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew how, or by what means Religion becomes &s;o Serviceable to the&s;e Ends; and that I may not exceed the Bounds of your Patience, &s;hall endeavour to reduce the &s;everal Ways by which it does &s;o, unto the Five following more General Heads.[<HI>I.</HI>] It Contributes to the&s;e Ends as it E&s;tabli&s;hes Good Principles.

[<HI>IV.</HI>] As it lays the mo&s;t forcible Obliga|tions, both upon Rulers &amp; Ruled, to be Faith|ful in their re&s;pective Duty's. [<HI>V.</HI>] As it Re&s;trains &amp; Subdues tho&s;e Lu&s;ts that are the Cau&s;es of all Irregularity and Un&s;ucce&s;sful|ne&s;s of Government in its Admini&s;trations.

That however Particular Forms of Govern|ment (with the various Regulations they are under) can't (as &s;uch) lay Claim to a Divine Right, yet that Government in General, Civil Subordination and Power is the Ordinance of Heaven. Mo&s;t certain it is, that whether there be Government among Men yea or not, is not a matter left to Humane Determinati|on; but it's already Re&s;olved by the Mo&s;t High, <HI>That there be a Rule over Men&punc; The God of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>hath Said it, the Rock of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>has E|&s;tabli&s;hed it.</HI> And the Power of tho&s;e who are Exalted to the Seats of Government, is from Him.

In Elective States, where Per&s;ons are Advanc'd by the Suffrage of others to Places of Rule, and Ve&s;ted with Civil Power, the Per&s;ons Chu&s;ing give not the Power, but GOD.

And hence it is, that Hu|mane Laws bind the Con&s;cience: Not &s;imply as Humane, but as made by that Authority which is Divine in its Original, and to which Obedience is Commanded in the Divine Law. Now with this u&s;eful point of Knowledge

Chri&s;tianity furni&s;hes Per&s;ons: It in&s;tills and e&s;tabli&s;hes &s;uch Principles as the&s;e, viz. <HI>The Powers that be, are Ordained of God; and there is no Power but of God,</HI> Rom. 13. 1. <HI>By Him Princes Rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth,</HI> Prov. 8. 16. <HI>Rulers are His Mini&s;ters for Good,</HI> Rom. 13. 4. And by this means become &s;er|viceable to the&s;e ends. Such Principles as the&s;e re&s;pecting Government, greatly contri|bute to the Rectitude &amp; Succe&s;s of it. They greatly promote Fidelity in Rulers, by a due exerci&s;e of their Authority.</P>
<P>When Rulers are E&s;tabli&s;hed in this, and duely Con&s;ider that they are Gods by deputa|tion, the Mini&s;ters of the Mo&s;t High, Arm'd and Ve&s;ted with His Power, &amp; that with this de&s;ign, <HI>viz.</HI> That they may be as Gods to tho&s;e over whom they Rule, by a due imita|tion of the Excellency's appearing in the Di|vine Government, it will entertain them with many &s;trong and forcible Motives to utmo&s;t Application in endeavours to an&s;wer the end of their Creation, by a due Exerci&s;e of the Authority Ve&s;ted in them.</P>
<P>And as for tho&s;e who are in a &s;tate of Sub|jection, or under Rule, &s;uch will be the influ|ence of the&s;e tho'ts upon them, as will have a good tendency to give Succe&s;s to tho&s;e Admini&s;trations.</P>
<P>Where the&s;e Principles of Chri&s;tianity have

not obtain'd in Society's, Per&s;ons are ignorant of them: Or any Principles of a contrary Na|ture are advanc'd; by rea&s;on whereof Civil Subordination or Rule, is look'd upon as Hu|mane; a thing without Divine Warrant, Au|thority, and the Sovereign In&s;titution of God, tis fatally Prejudicial to the&s;e ends. Leveli&s;m directly tends at once to de&s;troy both the Rectitude &amp; Succe&s;s of Government; to make Rulers betray their Tru&s;t, pro&s;titute their Authority to the wor&s;t de&s;igns, and to ener|vate the Force of all their Admini&s;trations. Whereas the&s;e rectify'd tho'ts concerning it, render it Sacred &amp; Venerable in the eyes of all, in&s;pire Rulers with the mo&s;t Noble Re|&s;olves, and the Ruled with a due Fear and Reverence of it.</P>
<P>II. <HI>As it directs and influences Rulers, in all Admini&s;trations to pur&s;ue, or yield up them&s;elves to the Guidance of the be&s;t Maxims or Rules of Government.</HI> This Fear of God, as it will pro|duce in them an Abhorrence of &s;uch Rules of Government, which altho' they are recom|mended by &s;ome as Healthful to a State, yet are really Prejudicial to whatever is de&s;irable therein, &s;o in the whole of their Conduct to yield up them&s;elves to the Government of tho&s;e that are of a contrary tendency. The due and &s;ucce&s;sful Exerci&s;e of Government,
<PB N="17" REF="001598_0018_0FB3E80C824D1898">
has a nece&s;&s;ary dependance upon this; in&s;o|much that where &s;uch whole&s;ome Rules are wanting in Society's, or Rulers govern not them&s;elves by them, but by unaccountable Humours, &amp; arbitrary Will, which are never Steady and Con&s;tant; and do not in this Ar|ticle labour to imitate the Divine Govern|ment; which is manag'd by fixed and &s;teady Rules, there is no hope that either of the&s;e Ends will be obtain'd. Government agrees with all other Arts in this, that its manag'd by certain fix'd Rules or Precepts, and the Rectitude &amp; Succe&s;s of it may no further be expected than tho&s;e Rules are attended. By the&s;e and the wi&s;e and prudent Application of them, a State is Upheld and Perpetuated, the Beauty, Order, Proportion, Strength and Unity of it Maintain'd; and all hurtful Di|&s;tempers that threaten the Ruine of it, either Prevented or Purged out.</P>
<P>Agreeably to this, there are no Regular Well-order'd Society's where the&s;e things are not to be found. Indeed the&s;e Precepts of this Divine Art (as to all of them) are not the &s;ame in all Society's, but various according to the different Con&s;titutions of them.</P>
<P>As the &s;ame Applications in Phy&s;ick will not &s;uit with all Body's, but due regard is wont to be had to the difference of Temper or Con|&s;titution&punc; &s;o neither the &s;ame Sy&s;tem of Po|liticks

with all Body's Politick, nor yet with the &s;ame at all Times, and under all Emer|gency's; and accordingly they are wont to be diver&s;ify'd with a Prudent Regard to the difference of Con&s;titutions and Times.</P>
<P>Now whatever Rules of this Art of Govern|ment are recommended, either in the Sacred Oracles, or by the be&s;t Ma&s;ters of Civil Policy (agreeably thereto) as Healthful to a State (be they more general, or of a more re&s;train|ed Nature) Religion will influence Rulers to act &amp; do all things in their re&s;pective Stations, under the Direction and Influence of them. And not only &s;o, but will very much Fortify them again&s;t the dangerous impre&s;&s;ions of any Temptations (alluring or terrible) tending to turn em a&s;ide from them: And by this means al&s;o, becomes Serviceable to the&s;e Ends.</P>
<P>Suffer me here, by the way, but to Sugge&s;t two or three of the&s;e, in&s;tead of many, that might be more largely in&s;i&s;ted upon.</P>
<P N="1">1.<HI>'Twill influence Rulers in the whole of their Conduct, to appear with a di&s;tingui&s;hing Zeal for the things God has put a peculiar Honour upon and Dignify'd with His Name.</HI> I mean, His Word, Wor&s;hip, Ordinances, Day, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Zeal for God &amp; the things wherein His Glory is peculiarly concerned, is in&s;eparable from the Fear of God. <HI>Elijah</HI> &s;ays, 1 King. 19. 10. <HI>I have been very Jea|lous for the Lord of Ho&s;ts; for the Children of</HI> I&s;|rael

<P>'Tis a Rule, not only many ways recom|mended in the Word of God, but moreover by the greate&s;t Ma&s;ters of Tho't, and that to all Society's however Con&s;tituted or Di&s;tingui&s;h'd in their Formal Natures.

He that believes

the truth a&s;&s;erted in our Doctrine&punc; and withal con&s;iders that the de&s;ign of God in the&s;e things, and in requiring our Reverent Ob&s;ervance of them, is our Conformity to Him; that by the&s;e things as Means, we might be made partakers of the Divine Nature, &amp; transform'd into His Likene&s;s. In a word, That this Fear of Him might be in&s;till'd into the hearts of Sinners, pre&s;erv'd &amp; flouri&s;h there, and that the Neg|lect and Contempt of the&s;e things is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the&s;e de&s;igns, can't but &s;ee it to be a Rule of the la&s;t Con&s;equence to the Civil Good of Society's, and in particular to the Ends mention'd in our Doctrine.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It will influence Rulers to employ their Wi&s;dom &amp; Power</HI> (as far as they may) <HI>to Rectify what|ever in the State is Prejudicial to the&s;e Ends.</HI> As Religion&amp;Rea&s;on joyntly concur in a&s;&s;erting it as a good Rule of Policy, that Rulers to their utmo&s;t a&s;&s;ert&amp;maintain whatever in the State apparently tends to advance the&s;e ends; &s;o no le&s;s that their Wi&s;dom &amp; Power be pru|dently employ'd to rectify whatever therein &s;tands in the way of them; and that whether it be in the main frame of their Admini&s;tra|tions, or any thing el&s;e. Among the &s;everal Forms of Government in the World, there are &s;ome apparently un&s;uitable to the&s;e ends; they are proportion'd not to Advance any de&s;igns of Government, but to gratify Pride, Tyranny &amp; Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="001598_0022_0FB3E8135C768F60">
Others, altho' they are more adapted to the&s;e ends, yet not all equally &s;o; &s;ome are more advantagiou&s;ly &s;uited to the ends of Go|vernment than others. And hence doubtle&s;s, it is in a great mea&s;ure that the Succe&s;s of Go|vernment in its Admini&s;trations in different Places is &s;o Various. The greate&s;t Sagacity &amp; Prudence is nece&s;&s;ary in founding States, and drawing the Plan or Scheme of Government in Society's: And many times notwith&s;tanding the be&s;t Prudence &amp; Conduct, great Errors are committed in the management of that Affair.</P>
<P>Sometimes again in Governments of the mo&s;t perfect Model, or advantagious Form, the due &amp; &s;ucce&s;sful Exerci&s;e of it is otherwi&s;e Ob|&s;tructed. Tis difficult to enumerate the many things in Society's which many times concur to hinder the due Exerci&s;e of Government, &amp; ob&s;truct its Succe&s;s. But whatever it be that &s;tands in the way of the&s;e things, this will in|fluence Rulers to u&s;e all due and proper Me|thods for the removal of it. As for what may be ami&s;s in the main frame of their Ad|mini&s;trations, they will be hereby led to recti|fy, &amp; as far as is in their Power, &amp; may be done with Safety to the State, they will endeavour to reduce all things to the mo&s;t perfect Model.</P>
<P>And as for whatever el&s;e may prejudice the&s;e things, they will take care to remove them. Men of Corrupt Principles &amp; Practices,
<PB N="22" REF="001598_0023_0FB3E814EFE0D600">
who many times (by managing their Private views &amp; de&s;igns) put all things out of Order in Society's, (as <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ugge&s;ts, <HI>Prov.25.5.</HI>) They will be hereby influenc'd to di&s;card &amp; put from them. And whatever E&s;tabli&s;h|ments may have been made, &amp; prove really di&s;|&s;erviceable to the&s;e ends, they will rever&s;e, or &s;o alter as to make them Contribute to the carrying on the&s;e good De&s;igns.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Where &amp; as far as Places of Tru&s;t &amp; Power are at the di&s;po&s;e of Rulers, this will influence them in preferring Per&s;ons to them, to have entire regard to their Merits, or tho&s;e &s;uitable Qualifications, that ju&s;tly recommend them thereto.</HI> In the ma|nagement of this affair, it will di&s;po&s;e them to lay a&s;ide Faction, Intere&s;t, Affection, &amp; all tho&s;e Private Views which too often are wont to in|fluence in affairs of that Nature, and to regard tho&s;e Natural &amp; Divine Qualifications men|tion'd in the Word of God as nece&s;&s;ary in tho&s;e who are to Rule over Men. In a word; Among the Precepts of Wi&s;dom left us by that Wi&s;e&s;t of Kings <HI>Solomon,</HI> in his Book of <HI>Proverbs,</HI> there are many excellent Rules of Go|vernment &s;ugge&s;ted. He tells us, Chap. 16. 12. <HI>It is an abomination to Kings to commit Wickedne&s;s: and that the Throne is e&s;tabli&s;hed by Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And 25.2,-5. <HI>It is the Glory of God to conceal a thing; but the Honour of Kings is to &s;earch out a matter.

<P>III. <HI>As it influences Rulers in all Admini&s;tra|tions, carefully to ob&s;erve the proper Extent &amp; Li|mits of their Power.</HI> This Particular Properly belongs to the forementioned General; and might have been there mentioned as a Rule of Civil Policy, which this Fear of God will in|fluence Rulers (in their Conduct) to ob&s;erve; but I chu&s;e to Con&s;ider it by it &s;elf. As all Civil Power is a Derivative, comes from God, and is a Ray of His, &s;o is it His Prerogative to impart it in what Degrees He plea&s;es, and to fix the Bounds &amp; Limits of it; which ac|cordingly He has done in His Word. As He has therein Ordained a Subordination among Men, that &s;ome have a right to Rule over o|thers; &s;o likewi&s;e has He given Laws to their Authority, and not left them at Liberty to
<PB N="24" REF="001598_0025_0FB3E8188E2BB368">
Pur&s;ue and Accompli&s;h their own De&s;ires.</P>
<P>And as for the various Degrees of Per&s;ons, that may be Employ'd in the exerci&s;e of Rule, and the re&s;pective Limitations of their Power, tho' it be a matter left to Humane determi|nation, yet mu&s;t be Manag'd with due regard to tho&s;e General Laws God has given, de&s;cri|bing &amp; determining the Bounds of Humane Authority.</P>
<P>In the Management of this Affair, as due Care mu&s;t be taken to Ve&s;t &s;uch Powers in Men as by a due Exerci&s;e of which the gene|ral Ends of Government may be provided for, &s;o likewi&s;e that no Authority be Ve&s;ted in them, that is not Proportioned to tho&s;e Ends. Now I &s;ay, whatever Powers may by the Po&s;itive Laws of Society's, be &s;ettled upon the&s;e and tho&s;e (be they Supreme or Subor|dinate in the Seat of Government) in Subor|dination to tho&s;e Laws of God before men|tioned; Religion will influence them in the whole of their Conduct, to have due regard to the proper Extent and Limits of it. As it will oblige them to exerci&s;e the Utmo&s;t of their Authority, to further the de&s;igns of Go|vernment; &s;o on the other hand, to be very Cautious how they encounter and bear down the Laws with their Prerogative. And that this Fear of God in this way Contributes not a little to the ends mention'd in our Doctrine,
<PB N="25" REF="001598_0026_0FB3E81A05D95850">
will be very evident in two or three Articles.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Power Ve&s;ted by God in Rulers, is a Li|mited Power.</HI> As it is a Power Subordinate to God's, &s;o Limited by Him.

&amp; Dependant, &amp; Regulated by an higher Law. This will appear in a few Hints.</P>
<P>It's not left as a matter of Liberty with Ru|lers, to determine whether Religion &s;hall be Publickly Profe&s;s'd, or God Publickly Wor|&s;hipp'd, yea or not. Its in their Power to in|troduce Religion into Society's, and incorpo|rate it with the Laws of them, which when it is once done, they have not a like Power to di&s;card it again. Even that Heathen Prince <HI>Darius,</HI> Sinned &amp; Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the limits of his Authority, in that Profane part of his De|cree, Dan. 6. 7,&mdash;<HI>That no man &s;hould ask any Petition of any God for thirty days.</HI></P>
<P>Neither is it left to the Determination of Rulers, whether due Care be taken by them for the &s;uitable Support of it, yea or not. Tis already determin'd in the Law of God, That they &s;hall do &s;o. This as it has made the Wor&s;hip of God an indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty, &amp; De|termin'd of the &s;everal parts of that Wor&s;hip, and that a certain Order of Men be &s;et apart to that Service, (who &s;hall devote &amp; give them|&s;elves to it) &s;o likewi&s;e, that a &s;uitable Re|venue be &s;ettled upon them. Indeed, there &s;eems not to be any determination in the law of God of any particular Proportion of mens E&s;tates for this end or u&s;e. That ancient Law that &s;tated the <HI>Tithe,</HI> &s;eems to be a Law <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on rea&s;ons peculiar to the Common-Wealth

of the <HI>Jews</HI> as &s;uch; and not upon rea&s;ons com|mon to all Places. The Prie&s;ts and Levites under the Law, as they made up a con&s;idera|ble part of that People, (ordinarily a Thirti|eth part, as is ob&s;erv'd) &s;o much was the pecu|liar Ble&s;&s;ing of God upon their Labours in Tilling the Earth, that the common Returns of it were very great: Sometimes Thirty, &s;ome|times Sixty, &amp; &s;ometimes an Hundred-fold; as may be gather'd from the Parable of the good Ground, in the Go&s;pel. And it being &s;o, it &s;eems unrea&s;onable to extend that Law to other Nations, where tho&s;e that Mini&s;tred in Holy Things bear not that proportion to o|thers, &amp; the Soyl is not &s;o rich in its Returns.</P>
<P>But tho' it be thus, yet that a &s;uitable Sup|port be always continu'd to tho&s;e who Mini|&s;ter in Sacred Things, the Law of God has de|termin'd, and that as due by a Natural Equity, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> IX. And to determine otherwi&s;e, Ru|lers are without Power.</P>
<P>Nor yet may Humane Authority Ordain what it plea&s;es in the Wor&s;hip of God. <HI>Jero|boam,</HI> (who made <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to Sin) <HI>Ahab, Ahaz</HI> and others who did, &s;o, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the lines of their Authority.

They may not appoint what Ordinances or Ceremony's they plea&s;e, in the Wor&s;hip of God.

On the part of the Ruled,
<PB N="35" REF="001598_0036_0FB3E82A8EDC9890">
there is Honour of Reverence, Tribute and Obedience due. There is a peculiar Re&s;pect and Honour due to Rulers: They are &s;tyled Dignity's, with reference to the place of Su|periority they &s;tand in above others: And that Honourable Name they are Dignify'd with [<HI>I &s;aid, Ye are Gods:</HI>] And as they are &s;o, &s;o there are peculiar degrees of Deference, and Re&s;pect due to them above others. <HI>David</HI> tho' unju&s;tly and cruelly Per&s;ecuted by <HI>Saul,</HI> yet becau&s;e of his Dignity, (he being the Lord's Anointed) one Dignify'd with the Name &amp; Authority of GOD, he &s;hews a peculiar Ho|nour and Re&s;pect to him, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24.6.

(which is an act of Ju&s;tice) but moreover to manife&s;t their peculiar Re&s;pect, by Pre&s;enting them with their Gifts. Now I &s;ay, Whatever Duty's belong to this Relation, (whether on the part of the Ruler, or the Ruled) Religion has a di&s;tingui&s;hing influence to promote Fi|delity in them.</P>
<P>As to Rulers, it pre&s;ents them with the mo&s;t powerful inducements to Faithfulne&s;s. It is no le&s;s proper to prevent Errors in the Defect, than in the Exce&s;s. Thus it is, as by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her Means, &s;o particularly by unveiling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Na|ture of an Oath, and the Solemn Obl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ion it carry's with it. An Oath in general, is a Solemn Invocating GOD to Witne&s;s for the Confirmation of the Truth, and Sincerity of what we Say or Promi&s;e. Hereby an Emi|nent Honour is given to God: He is acknow|ledged as the Author, Lover &amp; Rewarder of Truth; and as one that Sees and Knows all things. It's a part of Natural Wor&s;hip, and reduceable to the Fir&s;t Commandment of the Law, in regard of the Object Invocated, <HI>viz.</HI> GOD. But in re&s;pect of the Reverend U&s;e of it, (or the Name of God in it) &s;o its to be referr'd to the Third Commandment. Tis either A&s;&s;ertory, or Promi&s;&s;ory; and as in the former, we do in the mo&s;t Solemn Manner Call upon God in the&s;e (or the like) words, <HI>Let the All-&s;eeing GOD, the Fountain and Au|thor
<PB N="37" REF="001598_0038_0FB3E82DE5E0DE70">
of Truth, that GOD that ponders the Spirits, and is the Righteous Judge of the World, come down and Witne&s;s to the Truth of what I A&s;&s;ert; and let Him take Vengeance on me, if I A&s;&s;ert that which is Fal&s;e.</HI> So in like manner, we do in the Promi&s;&s;ory Oathes. We Invocate Him in like manner to Witne&s;s to the Truth or Since|rity of our Promi&s;es, and Imprecate the like Vengeance upon our &s;elves, in ca&s;e of In-&s;ince|rity. In every Oath, there is evermore an Imprecation expre&s;s'd or imply'd. This in &s;hort is the Nature of it, as might be &s;hew'd at large. And from hence tis evident, it is a thing of the mo&s;t Solemn Obligation, and to be inviolably kept, tho' we Sware to our Hurt, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 15. 4. And by laying open the Nature of this, and the Solemn Obligation of it, Religion becomes (not only otherwi&s;e) Serviceable to Government, but particularly as it promotes Fidelity in Rulers. Again, It is very power|ful this way, as it gives to and maintains in them, a Rectify'd Sen&s;e of their State: That however (in other re&s;pects) they are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from others, yet in this they &s;tand upon a Level, viz. <HI>That they are liable to Death, and the Con&s;equents of it.</HI> Hereby they will be led often to revolve in their Minds, that they are as liable to Death, and the cruel Ar|re&s;ts of a guilty Con&s;cience in their la&s;t Hours, and the dreadful Condemnation of the Judge

at la&s;t, as others, in ca&s;e of Unfaithfulne&s;s. It will be often reminding them of that So|lemn <HI>Memento</HI> of their Mortality which we have, P&s;al. 82.6,7. <HI>I &s;aid, Ye are Gods: but ye &s;hall Die like Men.</HI> In a word; It will be often removing the Vail that is drawn over the in|vi&s;ible World, and making tho&s;e lively repre|&s;entations both of the Joys &amp; Horrors of it; which will powerfully incite to &s;uch a Deport|ment of them&s;elves in their Places, that now they may have, &amp; at la&s;t &s;hare in the Felicity of an Unreproaching Con&s;cience, &amp; be filled with Hope and Confidence toward God.</P>
<P>Again, Religion is equally powerful to pro|mote Fidelity in the Ruled. It is no le&s;s pro|per to make Good Subjects, than Good Rulers. It is ob&s;erv'd by the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Machiavell.</HI></NOTE> Hi&s;torian, of <HI>Numa,</HI> that when advanc'd to Royal Dignity among the <HI>Romans,</HI> and being willing to reduce that then Barbarous People to Civil Obedience, he did by the influence of a Fal&s;e Religion of his own invention, work them to ready Com|pliance with whatever was de&s;ign'd by the Senate or Princes.

There is now no good Propen&s;ity in him, and he is willingly Subject, and yields a chearful Obedience to the Vile&s;t Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions. Tis thus with all Ranks and Degrees of Men whatever. The Rebellion of our Common Parent, was a Sin of Univer&s;al Efficacy, &amp; de|rives a Guilt and Corruption to all Mankind, in all Ages of the World. However Men may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd upon other accounts, yet in this Article they agree, <HI>viz.</HI> That an He|reditary Corruption is thereby diffu&s;ed into them. Superiors &amp; Inferiors (of what kind &s;oever) in this &s;tand upon a Level. Sin has equally Invaded them, Marr'd the Rectitude of their Faculty's, and Subjected them to the Empire of Lu&s;t and Pa&s;&s;ion. Pride, Envy, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, Sen&s;uality are Naturally the Guides of our Lives, &amp; to the Dictates of the&s;e we are very Ob&s;equious.

And unle&s;s the&s;e imperious Lu&s;ts be re&s;train'd or rooted out, there can be neither Rectitude, nor Succe&s;s in any Civil Admini|&s;trations. Now, this Fear of God (of all things) is the mo&s;t Effectual for this end: And whatever Virtue may be in any thing el&s;e tending this way, it is deriv'd from hence. This lays the mo&s;t powerful Re&s;traints upon the Lu&s;ts of all, and ca&s;ts tho&s;e Blocks in the way to all Sinful Gratifications, which it is hard to &s;urmount or get over: And not only &s;o, but extirpates &amp; roots them out.

<P>USE I. <HI>Hence it follows, that Enemy's to Religion are Enemy's to the State.</HI> 'Twill be readily acknowledg'd by all, That Civil Go|vernment contributes not a little to the Well-being of Religion.

<P>Let us often endeavour to recommend <HI>Reli|gion</HI> to the Rea&s;on &amp; Con&s;ciences of our Hear|ers. Religion <HI>is a rea&s;onable Service,</HI> Rom. 12. 1.

This is a proper Mean to wound the intere&s;t of Sin at the heart, di&s;|cover to Sinners the Folly of their Choice be|fore they come to their end, &amp; by &s;ad expe|rience &s;hall be convinc'd thereof. Tis a con|&s;iderable part of our work, to &s;et the&s;e things before Sinners in a true light: To unmask the Pre&s;ent World, and remove the Vail that is drawn over the Future &amp; Invi&s;ible; and make lively di&s;cover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the va&s;t di&s;parity between the Good and Evil things of Each.</P>

<P><HI>Further,</HI> Let us as far as is po&s;&s;ible, give our &s;elves to <HI>our Work.</HI> Suffer that Addre&s;s of <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy;</HI> 1 Tim 4. 13. <HI>Give attendance to Read|ing,

<P><HI>Finally,</HI> Give me leave further to add, That due &s;trictne&s;s in the Trial of <HI>Candidates for the Mini&s;try,</HI> and Care that none but &s;uch who&s;e merits recommend thereto, be admitted into the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> will doubtle&s;s contribute well to this good de&s;ign.

<P>Where the Methods E&s;tabli&s;h'd among a People to prevent a growing Apo&s;tacy, and to &s;ecure and advance the Cau&s;e of God among them, are apparently Ineffectual, (whether it be thro' the manife&s;t Un&s;uitablene&s;s of tho&s;e Methods for this end, or thro' Defect in the Pro&s;ecution of them) there ly's an indi&s;pen&s;i|ble Obligation upon <HI>Rulers</HI> to take the&s;e things into their <HI>Con&s;ideration,</HI> &amp; to endeavour to <HI>Recti|fy</HI> or <HI>Mend</HI> what is wanting or ami&s;s in them.</P>
<P>It is an excellent piece of Advice (&amp; very nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erv'd by all Per&s;ons how|ever imploy'd) which the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> gives, 1 The&s;. 4. 11. <HI>Study&mdash;to do your own Bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> None &s;hould go beyond their Line, &amp; meddle with things foreign to their Province.
