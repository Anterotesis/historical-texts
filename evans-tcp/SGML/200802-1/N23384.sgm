<P>IN the wild and barren country of Aberdeen&s;hire, within a league of the &s;ea-&s;hore, and on the &s;ummit of a lofty hill, &s;tood a gothic ca&s;tle. The bat|tered walls that had for ages &s;everely felt the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s hand of time were here and there decayed and crumbling into du&s;t; the battlements which
<PB N="6" REF="030954_0006_0FEA08B8C7C61CC0">
&s;eemed enveloped in the clouds, were all overgrown with ivy, and become the abode of the ill-favored and omin|ous feathered race. No vicinity, &s;ave a few &s;traggling cottages, the habita|tions of the va&s;&s;als; no &s;ound, but where the ocean in &s;ullen fury, la&s;hed the &s;andy beach, and di&s;mal murmurs echoed thro' the rocks.</P>
<P>This man&s;ion, while the &s;ceptre of England was &s;wayed by Henry the VIth, was the property of Sir James Wallace, a de&s;cendant of that illu&s;tri|ous character, William Wallace, who cho&s;e to encounter the perils and the frowns of war, rather than &s;ee his country become the &s;poil of a rapa|cious invader. Surely the eye that pe|ru&s;es thy fate, will not, cannot, refu&s;e the tribute of a tear to thy remem|brance! Peace to thy hallowed &s;hade; and may thy manly virtues meet with the reward above that was denied them here!</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="030954_0007_0FEA08BA7920A628">
The ca&s;tle had been be&s;towed on William as &s;ome &s;mall recompence for the &s;ervices he had done his king and country, and had from that period con|tinued in his family.</P>
<P>Sir James re&s;embled not his noble ance&s;tor; of a &s;ordid di&s;po&s;ition, deceit|ful, cruel, and de&s;igning, his heart was a &s;tranger to humanity or compa&s;&s;ion. The &s;miling cherub Charity dared not approach his inho&s;pitable roof; and the child of nece&s;&s;ity, who at his portal craved a &s;crap of bread, was not only peremptorily refu&s;ed, but if in&s;tigated by biting want to repeat the reque&s;t, was &s;purned from off the thre&s;hold.</P>
<P>The partner of his bed was a being every way oppo&s;ite to him&s;elf: her &s;u&s;ceptible heart never felt greater &s;at|isfaction than in relieving the needy, reclaiming the abandoned, and reward|ing the virtuous!</P>

Matilda, &s;o &s;he was called, was daughter to the Lord Glencairn, a man who, but for one failing, was formed an ornament to &s;ociety. Am|bition was his darling pa&s;&s;ion, and the wi&s;h of aggrandizing, and enriching his family, wholly employed his thoughts.</P>
<P>At the ca&s;tle of this Baron, Sir James fir&s;t &s;aw lady Wallace, and a&s;ked her of the Earl, who joyfully con&s;ented to accept him as his &s;on. Not &s;o Matilda; the di&s;&s;imilarity of di&s;po&s;ition with which nature had en|dued her&s;elf, and Wallace, cau&s;ed her ju&s;tly to look with horror on the ap|proaching nuptials. Nor was that the only rea&s;on; her gentle heart had long and faithfully been given to ano|ther. Alan Duntrone, of a noble, but unfortunate family, who&s;e chief boa&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of an illu&s;trious de&s;cent, and an un&s;potted reputation, was the object of her affection. He had, &s;ometime
<PB N="9" REF="030954_0009_0FEA08C114B18BE0">
before embarked for France, to &s;erve under the banners of the Gallic Mon|arch; and had not been long upon the continent, ere the fatal news arrived that he had fallen covered with wounds and glory. But the heart of Matilda was too firmly attached ever to be withdrawn from her fir&s;t and only love.</P>
<P>Glencairn commanded his daughter on pain of denouncing a cur&s;e upon her head, to become the wife of Wal|lace. The timid and dutiful victim yielded to the rigor of her unnatural parent, and at the altar pre&s;ented her hand, and pledged tho&s;e vows which were in the po&s;&s;es&s;ion of her lo&s;t Alan.</P>
<P>Alas! can the gaudy &s;plendor of a court, the noi&s;y riot of a midnight banquet, or a profu&s;ion of u&s;ele&s;s ore, in&s;ure content? Erroneou&s;ly too oft do parents judge, and while they fond|ly flatter them&s;elves they are en&s;uring

their offspring's happine&s;s, plunge them in la&s;ting mi&s;ery!</P>
<P>A &s;hort time &s;ub&s;equent to the mar|riage of Lady Wallace, her father paid the great debt to nature, and on his death-bed declared the inju&s;tice he had done his child, implored her pardon, and clo&s;ed his eyes for ever, in hopes of meeting more mercy above, than he had &s;hewn his daughter here.</P>
<P>The edge of her grief (for &s;pite of the har&s;h treatment &s;he had experi|enced, &s;he tenderly loved her Father) was &s;omewhat blunted by the birth of a female, who&s;e helple&s;s infancy arou&s;ed her from the &s;tupor into which &s;he had &s;unk, and for who&s;e &s;ake alone &s;he wi&s;hed to live.</P>
<P>Fortune who&s;e delight it is to &s;port and trifle with the feelings of man|kind, fully evinced her blindne&s;s, and di&s;regard of merit, in the fate of Ma|tilda.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="030954_0011_0FEA08C634B68990">
The barren habitation in the north ill &s;uited with the libertine di&s;po&s;ition of Sir James, and his chief time was &s;pent at Edinburgh, where in the bu&s;tle of the Scoti&s;h Court, he forgot his &s;uffering wife; immured in a &s;oli|tary ca&s;tle, without a friend into who&s;e brea&s;t &s;he could pour her &s;orrows, and hope for con&s;olation. The &s;tillne&s;s in which &s;he &s;at and watched the slum|bers of her little cherub, were uninter|rupted, &s;ave by the di&s;tant roaring of the waves, and whi&s;tling of the wind, which howled di&s;cordant through the ancient pile, and were at intervals ac|companied by the voice of the nightly &s;creech owl, melancholy inhabitant of the lofty battlements.</P>
<P>Yet even this &s;ad con&s;olation &s;he was in a &s;hort time deprived of. Her worthle&s;s lord had be&s;towed his heart on a woman, in who&s;e brea&s;t vice reigned as predominant as did virtue in that of his con&s;ort; &s;he was the wid|ow of an officer about the king's per|&s;on;
<PB N="12" REF="030954_0012_0FE9FCDC59451DC0">
her birth was low, and the eleva|ted rank wherein &s;he had latterly &s;hone, was in&s;ufficient to irradicate the &s;elfi&s;h ideas that were ingrafted by nature in her di&s;po&s;ition. The thought of &s;uch a man as Wallace at her feet, at once flattered her vanity, and made that re&s;tle&s;s ambition, which had been long kindling in her bo&s;om, burn with in&s;a|tiate fury. After a time &s;pent in

He, no le&s;s a dupe than villain, con&s;ented, and in&s;tantly &s;et out for Aberdeen, where on his arrival, he acquainted Matilda with the rea&s;on of his unlooked-for vi&s;it; and farther in|formed her &s;he mu&s;t then, it being night, depart, but that her infant &s;hould remain behind.</P>

The feelings of a mind, &s;u&s;ceptible as her's, may be better imagined than de&s;cribed. On one &s;ide, her pa&s;&s;ions were torn by wounded pride, while on the other the &s;ofter &s;en&s;es were rou&s;ed by maternal affection.</P>
<P>Recovering her&s;elf, however, &s;he yielded to nece&s;&s;ity, &s;natched a parting ki&s;s from her darling babe, moi&s;tened its little face with tears, and left the Ca&s;tle, attended only by Carrol, a creature of Sir James's, who had orders to convey her on board a ve&s;&s;el that lay at the &s;hore, from thence to proceed to Rouen, and lodge her in a convent, the abbe&s;s of which by bribes and promi&s;es, he had made his own.</P>
<P>Carrol executed his commi&s;&s;ion punctually, he delivered his tru&s;t, with a &s;trict charge that a &s;crutinizing eye &s;hould be kept upon her conduct; then returned, and rendered his ma&s;ter happy, by informing him "his loude&s;t fears were hu&s;hed."</P>

Jane (the daughter of Wallace) was thus, in the age of infancy, left with|out a friend who would in&s;truct her inexperienced mind, and train her in the &s;acred paths of virtue!</P>
<P>A &s;hort time previous to the exile|ment of Lady Wallace, her brother Archibald, who had &s;ucceeded the late Earl, his father, in the title and e&s;tates, &s;uddenly di&s;appeared; nor were the mo&s;t accurate enquiries able to pene|trate the my&s;tery in which his fate was involved.

<P>ELDRED, the young Lord of Glencairn, who was about the age of Jane, was happy in &s;uch a playmate; they let the hours glide by in plea&s;ure, and never did there appear a tedious one, but that on which they parted for the night.</P>
<P>Thus did they beguile their time till Eldred attained his 18th year, and though reared by his uncle in a man|ner more &s;uited to the abject &s;tation of a &s;ervile lacquey, than the repre&s;enta|tive of an illu&s;trious hou&s;e, he di&s;cov|ered a di&s;po&s;ition replete with valour, and affability. To his inferiors, con|de&s;cending
<PB N="17" REF="030954_0017_0FEA07C604B39918">
as the pliant reed to every puff of wind; but to tho&s;e who &s;ought to play upon his generous nature he re&s;embled the &s;tubborn fore&s;t oak, that bids defiance to the jarring elements, and braves the fury of the winter's &s;torm.</P>
<P>The youthful amu&s;ements of Jane, and her cou&s;in, had in&s;en&s;ibly created a &s;incere and ardent affection, which on their nearer approach to maturity, gained &s;trength; nothing &s;eemed wan|ting to complete their happine&s;s. Too tran&s;ient is the bli&s;s of mortals, &s;hallow is the cup of joy pre&s;ented to their lips, and &s;carce do they ta&s;te the enticing beverage, ere the bitter dregs at bot|tom de&s;troy the flavor of the wi&s;hed for draught!</P>
<P>Such was the ca&s;e of our young lovers; fortune was about to turn her wheel, and hurl them from the &s;poke of felicity to agony intolerable.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="030954_0018_0FEA07C99473A820">
Fame had blown the beauty of Jane to the remote&s;t parts of Caledonia's land, and a powerful and wealthy Highland Chief, named Donald of the I&s;les, (between who&s;e father and Sir James had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a &s;trong friend|&s;hip) was induced by her voice to quit his paternal fields, and judge whether report had or had not exaggerated. With a numerous retinue of knights and retainers he arrived at the man&s;ion of Wallace, and was welcomed there with pomp and affected ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>With impatience did he tarry for the minute that was to introduce him to the object who had cau&s;ed his journey. But when he &s;aw her he thought that had he been kept for ages in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, this one interview would have amply repaid him. All day did he contem|plate her charms, and when the hour of darkne&s;s warned him to retire, cur|&s;ed the tedious night that tore her from his &s;ight. Lo&s;t were the luxuries of the banquet on him, nor could the co|pious
<PB N="19" REF="030954_0019_0FEA07CFABAB9C78">
draughts of wine he &s;wallowed, wa&s;h away the pa&s;&s;ion which had taken root on his heart. He retired not to re&s;t, but to devi&s;e the means by which he &s;hould make her his own. At la&s;t he re&s;olved to a&s;k her of Sir James, but not till he had predetermined, in ca&s;e he had met with a refu&s;al, force &s;hould put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what was denied to his intreaties.</P>
<P>To a mind like his nothing appear|ed impracticable; of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, and unable to re&s;train them, 'tis not a matter of wonder he &s;oon fixed his re|&s;olution, nor could the mo&s;t imminent danger, or oppo&s;ition, have put him from his purpo&s;e. Of a bold and mar|tial deportment, he had all that feroci|ty in his countenance, which marks the Caledonians: brave to an exce&s;s, but artful to an equal degree, and would have waded through the blood of multitudes to accompli&s;h his de&s;ires: Such was the character of Eldred's rival.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="030954_0020_0FEA07D619FBA068">
He preferred his court&s;hip with &s;tu|died &s;miles, and &s;peeches formed by art and cunning; &s;he heard him at fir&s;t with indifference, he per&s;i&s;ted and was requitted with contempt. He then ad|dre&s;&s;ed his &s;uit to the Baron, he boa&s;ted of the high renown of his ance&s;tors, and the wide extent of his domain, he expatiated on the number of his va&s;&s;als, and &s;et forward the mutual advantages that would accrue from an alliance. Wallace li&s;tened to him with attention, while he recollected with di&s;gu&s;t the attachment he had ob&s;erved to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between Jane and Eldred. He &s;ought his daughter and commanded her to receive the addre&s;&s;es of his gue&s;t.</P>
<P>In vain the a&s;toni&s;hed maid lament|ed, wept, intreated; in vain &s;he pro|&s;trated her&s;elf at the feet of her un|feeling father; in vain &s;he tore her di&s;|ordered locks, and &s;mote her brea&s;t in angui&s;h! Her &s;upplications far from mitigating, added <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uel to his re&s;ent|ment, and confirmed him in his ungen|erous
<PB N="21" REF="030954_0021_0FEA07DA3767C2F8">
purpo&s;e: he mingled cur&s;es, and unkind reproaches, with his per&s;ua|&s;ions.</P>
<P>"Alas! &s;aid Jane, "Can Donald prize the con&s;trained embraces of a heart that beats for another? Will &s;ighs and groans accord with the care&s;&s;es of a bridegroom? To Eldred my faith is given, never, never to be broken!"</P>
<P>"By the Holy-rood! replied Sir James, "This ob&s;tinacy irritates me; nor &s;hall my wi&s;hes be fu&s;trated by the idle preten&s;ions of a boy; pay therefore the regard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and deference due to my mandate, or woe upon thy head. Meantime, preparations &s;hall be made for the &s;olemnity. Mark my words, and &s;ee thou do&s;t obey them!"</P>
<P>Then, with indignation bur&s;ting from his eye, he quitted the chamber, leaving his daughter in a &s;tate of &s;tupe|faction, till the entrance of Eldred awoke her from a trance, who ap|proaching, perceived the tears fa&s;t
<PB N="22" REF="030954_0022_0FEA07E1C8356CD8">
trickling down her lilly cheek, and with eager affection conjured her to make known the cau&s;e; which, when he knew, rage &s;o &s;hook his frame as to deprive him of articulation.</P>
<P>After a pau&s;e, "Can heaven," he exclaimed, "&s;uffer &s;uch inju&s;tice? O Jane, if thy affection be ardent, as I flatter my&s;elf it is, you cannot refu&s;e the boon which thus on my knees I crave!"</P>
<P>"Pronounce it," quoth Jane, "you know full well I can deny you naught."</P>
<P>"Enchanting &s;ound!" cried the enraptured lover, "Oh! then, my best beloved, con&s;ent to fly with me beyond the reach of &s;uch parental cru|elty; in &s;ome far di&s;tant private corner of the kingdom, let us obliterate the remembrance of your father's cruelty, and &s;oothe the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ant of wealth, by be|ing in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of each other.</P>

The bare idea of &s;uch a &s;tep, at fir&s;t made the timid &s;oul of Jane recoil; to quit the Ca&s;tle clande&s;tinely, and with a man, how mu&s;t, &s;he thought, her re|putation &s;uffer!</P>
<P>At length, however, the&s;e fears and &s;cruples were over-ruled by the per|&s;ua&s;ive eloquence of Eldred, and the con&s;cious purity of her own intentions.</P>
<P>"Yet," &s;aid Glencairn, "Can I re|&s;olve to immure tho&s;e beauties in a cot|tage, which heaven be&s;towed to grace a court? Impo&s;&s;ible!</P>

<P>THE next con&s;ideration was, how and when they &s;hould effect their e&s;|cape; it was determined to meet at midnight near a cavern that was &s;itu|ated at no great di&s;tance from the ca&s;|tle, and had formerly, in tho&s;e times when the Engli&s;h Edward was wont to invade his neighbors kingdom, been converted by the Scots into a pri&s;on, wherein they ca&s;t &s;uch of the enemy as became their captives. It had not been u&s;ed by the &s;tate for near a century, and the key had ever remained in cu&s;|tody of the Wallaces.</P>
<P>This &s;pot was fixed upon as the lea&s;t liable to di&s;covery, a vulgar notion hav|ing prevailed among the pea&s;ants that it was haunted; nay, they went &s;o far

as to aver they had heard frequent and melancholy noi&s;es i&s;&s;ue from it. This &s;uper&s;tition Sir James had &s;trenuou&s;ly endeavored to &s;uppre&s;s, &s;wearing who|ever dared to propagate &s;uch idle vague reports, &s;hould pay for their credulity.</P>
<P>Tediou&s;ly, to the lovers, did the &s;teeds of Phoebus go their daily cour&s;e, and with impatience they watched their de&s;cent behind the we&s;tern hills. The chapel clock announcing the hour of twelve, Jane ha&s;tened to the place of rendezvous, and Glencairn not being arrived, &s;eated her&s;elf upon a fragment of &s;tone, bitterly lamenting her way|ward fate.</P>
<P>"How cruel," &s;he &s;aid, "is my de&s;tiny; deprived in my earlie&s;t infan|cy of a mother's fo&s;tering care, com|manded by a har&s;h father to give my hand unto a man who&s;e mind I am ut|terly unacquainted with.

<P><PB N="27" REF="030954_0027_0FEA0806524133D8">
"Her care is &s;till for you," exclaim|ed a voice; while Jane, horror-&s;truck, threw her eyes around, and perceived a figure &s;uddenly turn an angle of the cavern; at this in&s;tant a dusky cloud enveloping the moon, left her in per|fect darkne&s;s, and on returning light in vain &s;he &s;ought for the cau&s;e of her &s;urprize.</P>
<P>Scarce had &s;he recovered from her panick, ere the &s;ound of foot&s;teps re|kindled her fears, which were as quick|ly di&s;pelled when &s;he &s;aw Glencairn approach. She informed him of her ex|traordinary adventure, which he &s;ought to per&s;uade her was but the coinage of her brain; yet too firmly was it im|pre&s;&s;ed on the mind of Jane, to be per|&s;uaded it was fancy.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time, be&s;towed in mutual vows, &s;ealed by their lips and witne&s;&s;ed by the cha&s;te Diana, they appointed a meeting early on the en&s;uing morn at a cottage in the near valley. The
<PB N="28" REF="030954_0028_0FEA080A59986228">
owner was a venerable woman, who had had the charge of Jane during her infancy, but had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed on Ma|tilda's expul&s;ion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Thither it was far|ther &s;ettled Andrew, the &s;ervant of Eldred, &s;hould bring hor&s;es to accele|rate their departure.</P>
<P>They then, with reluctance, bade adieu, and returned by different roads to the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>At day-break Jane proceeded to the appointed &s;pot, reflecting on the my&s;te|ry of a circum&s;tance, which her pre|&s;ent vi&s;it to the cottage brought fre&s;h to recollection. It was briefly this: In her &s;everal ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">tions thither, to which &s;he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">gated by humanity, &s;he had con&s;tantly ob&s;erved a female there, who on her entering ever retired, yet was there &s;omething maje&s;tic in her form that in&s;pired reverence.</P>
<P>In vain had &s;he que&s;tioned old Maud concerning her vi&s;itor; in vain had &s;he
<PB N="29" REF="030954_0029_0FEA080FC0A36808">
perplexed her&s;elf in conjectures of who it &s;hould be; and the predominant de&s;ire of woman, dear curio&s;ity, was left un&s;atisfied!</P>
<P>At the lowly portal &s;he found El|dred; he conducted her in, where &s;he was welcomed by the good ho&s;te&s;s, who had got the licenced trick of age. Prolixity in conver&s;ation was her mar|king feature; nor was there a po&s;&s;ibil|ity of bringing her to the end of a tale, till &s;he had made her accu&s;tomed ob&s;er|vations.</P>
<P>"My beloved mi&s;tre&s;s," &s;he cried, "in the name of the Holy Virgin, how come I honored with your company at &s;o early an hour? Has any mi&s;hap be|fallen you? I fear there has, for right &s;ure am I that my la&s;t night's dream bodes nothing good; however I will not at pre&s;ent trouble you with that, but return to &s;omething of more con|&s;equence. My good Lord, your cou&s;in, informed me that I might expect you;
<PB N="30" REF="030954_0030_0FEA081562904058">
but u&s;ele&s;s were my enquiries to what I &s;tood indebted for your vi&s;it."</P>
<P>"My good mother," an&s;wered El|dred, "had you permitted, I &s;hould ere this have &s;olved your que&s;tion."</P>
<P>"There now!" returned the aged owner of the hou&s;e, "had I permitted! Have I not already &s;aid I intreated you?"</P>
<P>"Maud," &s;aid Jane, "am I, from this to conclude you con&s;ider my vi&s;it as un&s;ea&s;onable?"</P>
<P>"Un&s;ea&s;onable!" exclaimed the cottager with energy, "Alas, how little you know my heart! and yet you &s;hould know it, none ever had a greater intere&s;t in it. How often have you in early years reclined upon my bo&s;om? Ah! tho&s;e days for happine&s;s, I never &s;hall &s;ee their parallel. Yet what am I?

youth and beauty, Heaven will &s;urely ble&s;s you,"</P>
<P>Jane tarried the conclu&s;ion of this eloquent harangue, well knowing it would be fruitle&s;s to attempt an inter|ruption, then thanking Maud for her good wi&s;hes, made known her purpo&s;e, which &s;he had hardly ended, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hen An|drew arrived with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>The figure of this &s;ervant was too uncommon to let it pa&s;s without men|tion.</P>
<P>Nature, with whom he &s;eemed no favorite, had given him a pair of &s;mall grey eyes, but in her ha&s;te had forgot|ten the cu&s;tomary ornament of an eye|brow. His no&s;e was broad, and ap|peared as if &s;ome unlucky accident had &s;pread it acro&s;s his cheeks. His mouth was wide, and decorated with two enormous rows of variegated teeth, in which however black was the predom|inant colour. His bu&s;hy beard, a
<PB N="32" REF="030954_0032_0FEA081FE45E8C00">
fiery red, grew on his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">allow chin, like furze upon a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">un parched heath. His figure was not ca&s;t in Apollo's mould, being &s;quat and mu&s;cular, and having one leg a few inches &s;horter than its fellow, cau&s;ed his gait to be rather &s;hambling than maje&s;tic.</P>
<P>The character of this &s;ervant was al&s;o &s;omewhat &s;ingular; he was firmly atttached to his ma&s;ter, and would with plea&s;ure have &s;acrificed his own life in his defence. He was, moreover, a great philo&s;opher, and &s;carce ever an|&s;wered a que&s;tion without the addition of &s;ome mu&s;ty proverb. Yet were the &s;prings of his heart actuated by virtu|ous movements, and to his ma&s;ter he was firmly attached.</P>
<P>He entered, and, warned them to be gone. "Con&s;ider," &s;aid he, <HI>"Di&s;patch is the &s;oul of bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and by tar|rying here, you may chance to be ea&s;ed of the trouble of your journey. For no &s;ooner will you be mi&s;&s;ed, than

Let us be gone my Lord, <HI>Remember,</HI> quoth he, <HI>The early bird catcheth the worm."</HI></P>
<P>The earl thought there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound argument in what his follower &s;aid, and prepared to depart; on which Maud &s;uddenly left the room, but returned in a few minutes, craving permi&s;&s;ion to introduce a lady, who although a &s;tran|ger, profe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf much intere&s;ted in behalf of the two fugitives.</P>
<P>They begged Maud to introduce the lady; who entered the room vieled, and Jane, by her figure, di&s;covered the per&s;on &s;he had &s;o frequently &s;een there, who took her hand and pre&s;&s;ed it with fervor to her lips, inviting heaven to &s;hower its choice&s;t gifts upon her head,
<PB N="34" REF="030954_0034_0FEA082D84E77670">
and to avert tho&s;e calamities which had befallen her mother. Then pre&s;enting the hand &s;he held to Eldred, bade him in broken &s;obs, con&s;ider the value of the jewel he was about to have in charge; murmured a ble&s;&s;ing on them and precipitately withdrew, leaving her &s;pectators in amazement!</P>
<P>Jane took leave of her nur&s;e, and af|ter Glencairn had forced a pur&s;e upon her, they mounted their &s;teeds and &s;haped their cour&s;e &s;outherly, re&s;olv|ing to travel as far as Wales, amid&s;t the lofty mountains of that country, to tend their herds and live in peaceful retirement.</P>
<P>They rode conver&s;ing on the &s;trange rencounter at the abode of Maud, which much engro&s;&s;ed their thoughts; and the more &s;o as Jane affirmed &s;he had heard the voice before, till the dark gathering of the clouds foretold the impending &s;torm, and they had ju&s;t gained &s;helter in an adjacent grove,
<PB N="35" REF="030954_0035_0FEA0835D4C8E088">
when the rain poured down in tor|rents, loud whi&s;tled the wind amid&s;t the lofty foilage, while blue and forked lightning, gave a momentary gleam, and the big thunder, in deep, awful &s;trains, growled over their heads.</P>
<P>"Aye," cried Andrew, (throwing his plaid over his &s;houlders) "This re|minds me of an excellent proverb, <HI>Though the &s;un &s;hine, leave not your cloak at home."</HI></P>
<P>While they remained under &s;helter, they were &s;urpri&s;ed by the voices of men, one of whom cried, "They can|not be far off, I have good intelligence this is the road they took!"</P>
<P>"'Tis well," returned another, "if they are taken, our labour will be well requitted."</P>
<P>"If!" an&s;wered a third voice, "I will pur&s;ue them to the end of the world. By the beard of Holy St. An|drew, our Lord would &s;acrifice&punc; us
<PB N="36" REF="030954_0036_0FEA083B1203A220">
as accomplices, &s;hould we return with|out them."</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">unk to the very &s;oul of Jane.</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;he &s;aid, "the&s;e are our pur&s;uers! What will become of us?</P>
<P>"Fear not, my love," exclaimed Eldred, "I will protect you, while life exi&s;ts!"</P>
<P>"Then, my Lord," &s;aid Andrew, "the mo&s;t certain way of doing that, will be to run away; for take my word, you will not long have life, if you remain here." "Silence," inter|rupted his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>By this time a party of armed men appeared, and confirmed his &s;u&s;pi|cions; which, however they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> quickly di&s;pelled, by enquiring whether a com|pany of hor&s;emen had not pa&s;&s;ed. Be|ing an&s;wered, no! they informed our

<P>THEY then continued their pro|gre&s;s, and arrived in an exten&s;ive val|ley, &s;urrounded by a hanging wood. The rays of the God of Day, who was fa&s;t retiring for the night, ca&s;t a de|lightful &s;hade and added to the beauty of the &s;cene. Through the dale, over a pebbled bed, meandered a bubbling &s;tream, flanked on each &s;ide by mourn|ful willows. Ca&s;ting their eyes around in wonder, at the door of a cell they de&s;cried a man ve&s;ted in hermit's garb, who &s;ate apparently in melancholy
<PB N="39" REF="030954_0039_0FEA0844B28ED348">
reverie. Around the porch were in|terwoven ja&s;mines and honey-&s;uckles, the fragrance of which was odoriferous.</P>
<P>The Anchorite, on ob&s;erving our travellers approached and requested them, in a &s;tile more &s;uited to the pol|i&s;hed air of a courtier than the u&s;ual addre&s;s of a reclu&s;e, to enter his dwel|ling; to which they con&s;ented, mar|velling what could have induced a man who &s;eemed de&s;igned by Nature for the highe&s;t &s;phere, thus to &s;eclude him&s;elf, particularly as he was not of age to lo&s;e all reli&s;h for the plea&s;ures of &s;o|ciety. The traces on his features &s;eem|ed rather the effect of cruel retro&s;pec|tion than of time; yet had it not de|&s;troyed that grace and affability, which accompanied his every word and ge&s;|ture. Nor was their wonder dimini&s;h|ed, when they e&s;pied a &s;uit of armour &s;u&s;pended from the &s;toney roof.</P>
<P>"Enter," he cried, "my humble dwelling, and accept a hearty welcome,
<PB N="40" REF="030954_0040_0FEA08484BA16AC0">
which will be your only &s;auce to the poor fare that I can &s;et before you." <HI>"A good appetite is the be&s;t &s;auce;"</HI> &s;aid Andrew hurrying out to turn the hor|&s;es loo&s;e, that he might the &s;ooner be enabled to convince them there was truth in his a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>The hermit then produced &s;ome ex|cellent fruit, and water from the rivu|let that flowed before his door; of which Eldred and his fair companion partook &s;paringly. In the mean time, Andrew, having di&s;patched his bu&s;i|ne&s;s, quickly proved, by the attack he made on the provi&s;ions, that ab&s;tinence was not in the li&s;t of his philo&s;ophic virtues. "Aye," &s;ays he "this is as it &s;hould be, After the out&s;ide has been &s;o mauled, as that of my unhappy carca&s;e has, tis fit the in&s;ide &s;hould be well lined, to &s;upport the whole ca&s;e.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure your beverage is none of the &s;tronge&s;t. I have been well buf|fetted by this element any time for the la&s;t hour: but, thank Heaven, my

<P>Their repa&s;t ended, the Anchorite, who called him&s;elf Ambro&s;e, was in|tru&s;ted with the hi&s;tory of the young fugitives, concealing only their names; on which he made them the offer of his habitation as a refuge, until the &s;earch which would nece&s;&s;arily be made after them &s;hould &s;ub&s;ide. This friendly propo&s;al they joyfully accepted; and the daughter of Wallace being pro|vided with a &s;traw bed, the only one the place afforded, retired; while the Hermit, Glencairn, and Andrew, drew around a good neat fire for the night.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;equent morning, after re|galing them&s;elves, Jane and her lover walked into the &s;urrounding wood, when &s;he, faint for want of that re&s;t which her perturbed &s;tate of mind had denied her during the night, re&s;olved to &s;eek it under the &s;hadow of &s;ome
<PB N="42" REF="030954_0042_0FEA084F0F6C49B8">
kindly tree; &s;he therefore de&s;ired El|dred to leave her, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which he com|plied, and traver&s;ed the grove for &s;ome time. But how can his horror be de|&s;cribed, when on his return he &s;aw not Jane. Half frantic, he loudly called upon her name, but all in vain! At length he bethought him&s;elf, that po&s;|&s;ibly &s;he might have taken her way to the hermitage; and ha&s;ting thither, met his tru&s;ty &s;quire.</P>
<P>"Andrew," cried he, "ha&s;t thou &s;een the Lady Jane? I quitted her for a &s;hort time, and on coming to the &s;pot again, my longing eyes to no pur|po&s;e looked for her.</P>
<P>"My Lord," replied his attendant, "there is an old adage, and a very true one, that <HI>After joy comes &s;orrow."</HI></P>
<P>"Have you &s;een her?" returned the impatient Eldred.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="030954_0043_0FEA0852F7251C78">
"No my Lord," &s;aid he, "but let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s go in que&s;t of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; <HI>Seek till you find and you'll rarely lo&s;e your labour."</HI></P>
<P>Regardle&s;s of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, Glencairn made for the cell of Am|bro&s;e, and enquired of the holy man, whether his mi&s;tre&s;s had been there; on being an&s;wered in the negative, with wild de&s;pair pictured in his frenzy-rolling eye, again he darted amid&s;t the impervious &s;hade of the encircling fo|re&s;t, making it re-echo with his cries; till exhau&s;ted nature yielded beneath her burden, and he &s;unk &s;upine upon the earth.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;e, who, with Andrew, had been the whole day in &s;earch of El|dred, found him at la&s;t in the &s;ituation before mentioned; his face wrapped in the plaid robe he wore, and his brown locks wet with the evening dew.</P>
<P>Deaf to the entreaties of the Hermit, he remained immoveable, till &s;oftened
<PB N="44" REF="030954_0044_0FEA0858D8A41718">
by the per&s;evering and reiterated &s;up|plications of Andrew and the good man, he &s;uffered them to conduct him unto the hermitage. On his arrival, the agitation his &s;pirits had &s;u&s;tained brought on a raging fever, &s;o de&s;perate, that for &s;everal days his life was de&s;|paired of, during which time his ho&s;t admini&s;tered &s;uch drugs as the produce of the earth enabled him to prepare. But con&s;cious that his patient's mind &s;tood mo&s;t in need of medicine, he took the earlie&s;t opportunity that returning rea&s;on offered, on the part of Eldred, to inculcate the principles of religion, and &s;ooth his tortured &s;oul.</P>
<P>"My &s;on," &s;aid he, "reflect that the ways of providence are blind and intricate! &s;hall poor weak man at|tempt to rea&s;on, and &s;ay to Power Al|mighty, thou ha&s;t done ami&s;s? Bow with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of Heaven, and pour that precious cordial patience on your heart.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="030954_0045_0FEA085B8A4F9A48">
"True," cried Andrew, <HI>"Patience is a plai&s;ter for all &s;ores."</HI></P>
<P>"Ah, father!" exclaimed Glen|cairn, "to the in&s;en&s;ate feelings of an anchorite, my grief, I know, appears extravagant. But how can one, &s;eclu|ded from the world judge of tho&s;e &s;en|&s;ations by which the &s;u&s;ceptible pa&s;|&s;ions of frailer mortals are actuated? Had you, indeed, ever known what it is to love, and have the idol of your &s;oul thus torn away, you might with ju&s;tice rea&s;on on my ca&s;e."</P>
<P>"True again," &s;aid the philo&s;ophic &s;quire, <HI>"None know the weight of ano|ther's burden."</HI></P>
<P>At the latter part of Eldred's &s;peech, the &s;calding drop rolled down the Her|mit's cheek: after a time he thus re|plied.</P>
<P>"Alas, my &s;on! you know not what you have innocently done; probed a

<P><HI>"It is ill healing an old &s;ore!"</HI> ejac|ulated Andrew.</P>
<P>"Had I ever loved!" continued Ambro&s;e; "O! did you know my long &s;ad &s;ufferings, your own, heavy as you think them, placed in the &s;cale again&s;t mine, would &s;trike the beam; and notwith&s;tanding the repe|tition of them will rou&s;e a train of gloomy reflections, that for a moment &s;carce had &s;lumbered, yet will I re|count them, that, by the compari&s;on you may learn to bear with re&s;ignation the ills allotted to you."</P>
<P>"You had better not," cried the &s;quire of Glencairn, <HI>"When &s;orrow is a&s;leep, awake it not."</HI></P>

<P>"AN involuntary horror &s;eized me and made my &s;eated heart knock at my ribs, as though it would have bur&s;t its pri&s;on. It in&s;tantly occurred to me, the hou&s;e had been the &s;eat of murder, and that probably I was de&s;tined to the &s;ame wretched end."</P>
<P>"I had &s;carce made my comment on the &s;cene before me, ere my attention was again rou&s;ed by the clatter of ap|proaching hor&s;es, and I &s;oon heard their riders tap gently at the portal, which being opened, they a&s;ked if any company was within."</P>
<P>"Aye, replied the hoary villain, "there is a young man above, who,

if one may judge from apperance, will yield &s;omething hand&s;ome. He has not yet had time to compo&s;e him&s;elf to that re&s;t, which he little dreams will be his la&s;t."</P>
<P>"Silence Dubois," replied another voice, "we &s;hall depend on you for the execution of this bu&s;ine&s;s, as an affair of moment calls us hence."</P>
<P>"And you may depend on me," &s;aid the old man, "it is not the fir&s;t time. This good dagger has never yet failed me, and I'll an&s;wer it does not now. However, before you depart, drink one cup of wine to the &s;ucce&s;s of my undertaking; here is part of a fla&s;k that I opened for the credulous fool, who &s;hall pay dearly for it."</P>
<P>"Having drank, the hor&s;emen mounted and galloped off, leaving me in a &s;tate of mind more ea&s;ily conceiv|ed than de&s;cribed. I had not much time allowed me for reflection, as I

I un&s;heath|ed my &s;word, and &s;traitway plunged it in his heart.</P>
<P>"Traitor!" I exclaimed, "take from my hand the ju&s;t reward of thy crimes&mdash;crimes which exceed all bounds.

Ar|riving at the gate, I demanded admit|tance, which was granted, and I u&s;her|ed into an apartment, where I found the &s;uperior. He de&s;ired me to make known, who, and what I was; the truth I did not think it politic to en|tru&s;t him with, therefore, contented my&s;elf with &s;aying, I was about to join the army of the Duke of York."</P>

<P>"From this I learned, what I be|fore &s;u&s;pected, that my per&s;ecutors countenanced the depredations of Du|bois and his a&s;&s;ociates, and that proba|bly the &s;poils of tho&s;e travellers, who, had fallen by his hand, were conveyed to this holy place."</P>
<P>"We explored the different rece&s;&s;es of the mona&s;tary, and delivered a long train of victims, who, for years had
<PB N="68" REF="030954_0068_0FEA08976F1EA328">
groaned beneath the yoke of monki&s;h tyranny. Among&s;t the number, were a father and his &s;on, that particularly intere&s;ted me.

<P>"On ob&s;erving us, and in habits &s;o unlike what he had been accu&s;tomed to while in confinement, a &s;park of hope illumined the young man's fea|tures, and bur&s;t into a flame, on our telling him they were no longer pri&s;|oners.

<P>"We then departed with tho&s;e Fri|ars who had e&s;caped the &s;words of the &s;oldiery.

<P>He remained with Father Ambro&s;e until his bodily health was re&s;tored, when again the remembrance of Jane drove him almo&s;t to de&s;peration.</P>

<P>"I do," &s;aid Andrew; "<HI>Happy is he who knows his follies in his youth.</HI>"</P>
<P>The impetuous &s;allies of pa&s;&s;ion on the part of Eldred, were re&s;trained by the per&s;ua&s;ive arguments of his atten|dant; and it was &s;ettled they &s;hould abandon the hermitage on the follow|ing day. They made their intention known to Father Ambro&s;e, who in|treated his noble gue&s;t, but in vain, to prolong his &s;tay.</P>
<P>On the en&s;uing morn, the Reclu&s;e drew from his brea&s;t a ca&s;ket.</P>
<P>"This," &s;aid he, "is the legacy of an expiring foe. I trea&s;ured it, hoping it would have proved the means of u|niting me to her I adored. Tho&s;e thoughts are cru&s;hed forever! Accept this as a memorial of one, who though

<P>So &s;aying, he took out a ring, which he pre&s;ented to Glencairn, who thank|ed him for his pre&s;ent; but on looking at it, the blood for&s;ook his cheek, and his whole frame was convul&s;ed at per|ceiving it bore the cre&s;t of his family.

<P><PB N="88" REF="030954_0088_0FEA0803782B3DF0">
The&s;e were the feelings that tore his mind; he in&s;tantly ordered his charger, and taking an abrupt leave of the Anchorite, whom he could not &s;ee but with horror, vaulted into his &s;ad|dle, and ha&s;tened from the valley.</P>
<P>He rode towards the man&s;ion of Wallace, and di&s;mounted at twilight at the cottage of Maud, whom he que&s;tioned concerning Jane.</P>
<P>"On the fir&s;t news of your flight," an&s;wered &s;he, "Sir James and Donald, attended by their retainers, followed you; but to my great &s;urprize, on the &s;ub&s;equent evening, the former return|ed without his gue&s;t, denouncing the cur&s;e of an irritated parent on his daughter, and vowing he would no farther pur&s;ue her, but leave her to reap the ju&s;t reward of her di&s;obedience.

<P><PB N="89" REF="030954_0089_0FEA08084EB76138">
This intelligence increa&s;ed Eldred's anxiety.</P>
<P>"Let us be gone, Andrew," he cri|ed, "to the dwelling of this accur&s;ed rival: dearly &s;hall he make atonement for his villainy?</P>
<P>In vain were Maud's endeavors to di&s;&s;uade him from his purpo&s;e; in vain &s;he painted the dangers he mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily encounter, and the improbabil|ity of deriving any &s;ucce&s;s from his ra&s;h project.</P>
<P>"You forget," &s;aid he, "the name I bear, never did ba&s;e fear, or the thought of danger invade the mind of my illu&s;trious race, nor will I be the fir&s;t to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ully &s;uch a line of ance&s;tors.

<P>So &s;aying, in oppo&s;ition to the &s;tren|uous intreaties of Maud, he mounted his &s;teed, and attended by Andrew, &s;haped his cour&s;e northward.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd evening, he de&s;cried the &s;tupendous battlements of Donald's man&s;ion, rearing their rugged heads above the horrizon, in awful maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Advancing towards it he met a youth, who&s;e military accoutrements be&s;poke him one of Donald's retinue; and on examining his countenance, the air of ingeniousne&s;s with which it was &s;trongly imprinted, prompted Eldred to make his confidante, and to endeavor by gold, that all-per&s;ua&s;ive argument, to win him to his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>He acco&s;ted him with &s;ome trivial que&s;tion, a&s;king who&s;e was the adjacent man&s;ion; after which, he informed the

&s;tranger it was in his power to &s;erve him e&s;&s;entially.</P>
<P>"My gratitude," &s;aid he, "&s;hall not be confined to the &s;tale trick of words; I mean to give a more &s;ub&s;tantial proof of it. Take this pur&s;e, and re&s;t a&s;&s;u|red, that contains but a moiety of the acknowledgment I will make, provided you befriend me."</P>
<P>"Your look," replied the &s;oldier, "be&s;peaks you noble. I think, from your appearance, you would your&s;elf &s;corn a bribe. Why then &s;hould you &s;uppo&s;e me guilty of accepting one?

The&s;e words charmed Glencairn, who was per&s;uaded that at lea&s;t, in this in&s;tance, the face was an index of the mind. He in&s;tantly imparted his bu&s;ine&s;s to the &s;tranger, who confe&s;&s;ed Jane was within the ca&s;tle; at the &s;ame time, he acknowledged the in|ju&s;tice of Donald, and vowed to for|ward the &s;chemes of Eldred as much as in him lay.</P>

<P>DESPAIR now &s;eized upon the &s;oul of Eldred; deprived of liberty, robbed of the idol of his heart, whom with its utmo&s;t fervency he wor&s;hipped, what could he wi&s;h for but death?</P>
<P>Irritated by reflection, and accu&s;ing fate, that in&s;tead of permitting him to end his life in battle, like his ance&s;tors, had doomed him to peri&s;h in ignoble bondage, perhaps by the hand of an a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;in, he traver&s;ed his dungeon, till his foot &s;triking again&s;t a &s;omething threw him on the ground.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity prompted him to &s;eek the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">au&s;e of his di&s;a&s;ter; after a tedious

&s;earch he picked up a dagger, which from the feel he judged to be a ru&s;ty one. While his thoughts were em|ployed in vain conjectures, how, or for what purpo&s;e the in&s;trument came there, the beams of the moon ob&s;cure|ly gleamed through an aperture, in the roof of the cell, and pre&s;ented to his a&s;toni&s;hed &s;ight an human &s;keleton, then di&s;appearing he was again involv|ed in chaos.</P>
<P>So momentary and &s;o faint had been the light, he could not per&s;uade him|&s;elf but the horrors of his &s;ituation had conjured up this phenomenon, and that 'twas but a phantom of his di&s;ordered brain. Determined, however to con|vince him&s;elf, he felt about the place, till his hand falling on the fle&s;hle&s;s bones, brought conviction. While in this dreadful &s;ituation, a low and di&s;|mal groan from a far end of the dun|geon vibrated in his ear. So many con|curring horrors were &s;ure &s;ufficient to unnerve the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">bres of the &s;tronge&s;t

heart, and though unmoved he would have encountered a ho&s;t of foes, yet did this awful &s;cene &s;o work upon his fancy he could &s;carcely &s;upport him&s;elf; a cold and chilly dew flowed down his limbs, his knees forgot their office and &s;hook under him, his nerves were all relaxed and &s;inewle&s;s as the new-born infant's.</P>
<P>"What bloody act has this infernal den been made the &s;cene of?" he in|voluntarily cried; Unhappy wretch I am doomed to mingle my du&s;t with thine: Alas! thy mi&s;eries are ended, mine to come."</P>
<P>Harra&s;&s;ed with mental and corporeal fatigue, he threw him&s;elf upon the bed, and &s;trove to gain a temporary relief from his anxiety by &s;leep, but the care|&s;u&s;pending poppies fled his eyelids, and his groans of angui&s;h echoed through the place. He aro&s;e, walked in a &s;tate of di&s;traction, and his reflections &s;erved only to make his &s;ituation more deplor|able.
<PB N="108" REF="030954_0108_0FEA08E90CFE62B0">
In vain did he endeavour to pe|netrate the my&s;terious gloom that &s;ur|rounded his under&s;tanding; the more he tried to unravel the knotted clue, the more was he entangled in the maz|es of conjecture, without one leading thread to guide him to certainty; while the horrors of darkne&s;s, the whi&s;tling wind, and dreary &s;ounds of di&s;tant bells increa&s;ed the gloom.</P>
<P>During the whole night he was di&s;|turbed by a repetition of &s;ighs and me|lancholly noi&s;es, which i&s;&s;ued from one particular direction, and kept him in a &s;tate of racking unea&s;ine&s;s and anxiety.</P>
<P>At length the wi&s;hed for morn arriv|ed, and by the aperture through which the cha&s;te Diana had the preceding ev|ening ca&s;t her pale influence, the gaudy &s;un's illu&s;trious rays now made their way, and di&s;covered to Eldred the &s;itu|ation of his confinement.</P>

'Twas a &s;pacious, lofty vaulted cav|ern; on one &s;ide &s;tood an oaken table, rotten and worn out with age; a &s;tool that bore the &s;ame marks of antiquity, and a bed of &s;traw.

<P>The only light was admitted through the opening afore-mentioned, and which had been occa&s;ioned by an earthquake or &s;ome other &s;trong convul&s;ion of na|ture.</P>
<P>He was in the cour&s;e of the day &s;er|ved with provi&s;ions through a &s;mall iron grate; and by the ratling of vari|ous keys, and the creaking jar of gates, he judged his pri&s;on of too much &s;trength for him to entertain a hope of ever making his e&s;cape.</P>

Faint with his wound and lack of proper &s;u&s;tenance, he made a &s;light re|pa&s;t on bread and water (the only food allowed him) and &s;unk under the plea&s;|ing power of Morpheus; lo&s;ing for a time the remembrance of his cares.</P>
<P>While &s;leeping, his dreams pre&s;ented the figure of an aged man, who&s;e a&s;|pect commanded veneration and re|&s;pect.

the earth. He aro&s;e, his mind whol|ly engro&s;&s;ed in contemplating his dream, felt his way to the table, lighted his lamp, and removed the &s;keleton into a rece&s;s at the far end of the cavern, and the part whence the groans he had heard on the preceding night appeared to i&s;&s;ue. Scarce had he laid it on the ground, ere the &s;ame di&s;mal &s;ounds har&s;hly &s;truck his ear, and determined him, if po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;cover the cau&s;e.

<P>'TIS now nece&s;&s;ary to return to Do|nald, who having re&s;igned the captive Eldred to his followers, entered the ca&s;|tle, and &s;ummoned Andrew to his pre|&s;ence.

"Approach and fear not," &s;aid the Chief, "fain would I be thy friend. Convince the lady Jane thy ma&s;ter has renounced her, and fortune is thy own. As an earne&s;t of my favor, I pre&s;ent you with this pur&s;e."</P>

<P>The &s;oldiers obeyed, and having pinioned his arms, which gave him an appearance not unlike a tru&s;&s;ed capon, conveyed him to his cell, and left him, with the alternative of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hewing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ud of bitter reflection, or &s;ome moul|dy bread, which was the only &s;u&s;ten|ance they left him.</P>

"Here is indeed," muttered the cap|tive, "&s;ufficient room for meditation; here I can indulge my philo&s;ophy, which bids fair to be put to the proof, and with as little fear of interruption as the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed cottager has to fear the relief of greatne&s;s. Should I ever be delivered from this Giant of the Ca&s;tle, this Donald, never more will I act a part &s;o ill &s;uited to my abilities, as that of a Squire.

<P>Thus did the unlucky Andrew la|ment his fate.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Donald &s;ought the apartment of Jane, who&s;e timid nature he di&s;turbed with his impetuous &s;olicitations.

Nor was his conduct to Jane the on|ly inju&s;tice Donald was guilty of, Scot|land, at that period, abounded with robbers; the whole kingdom was in a &s;tate of civil war; the depredations of banditti were not only tolerated but encouraged by the barons.

He attacked Argyle, and the I&s;le of Arran; and having obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ca&s;tle of the latter by &s;trata|gem, he levelled it with the earth.</P>

<P>WHILE the iron hand of civil war raged thus in Scotland, Henry of England perceiving an advantageous opportunity, as he and his predece&s;&s;ors were ever wont to do, commanded the inhabitants of Northumberland, and the other counties on the borders, to make incur&s;ions; while the di&s;tracted &s;tate of Caledonia, prevented James, (the &s;overeign of that nation) making any con&s;iderable attempt to repul&s;e the foe; and a defeat of his army by Hen|ry Piercy, Earl of Northumberland, cau&s;ed Donald to think this a favorable juncture to obtain a pardon for him&s;elf and his a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="030954_0121_0FEA0909CE8F0918">
He therefore &s;ent me&s;&s;engers to this purpo&s;e to his maje&s;ty, who handled the matter very craftily, not openly and plainly forgiving the tyrant, nor yet making the amba&s;&s;adors entirely de&s;pair of remi&s;&s;ion for their chief.</P>
<P>He an&s;wered them gently, that the Lord of the I&s;les de&s;erved no mercy at his hands, that the languinary acts o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> which he had been guilty called aloud for vengeance; neverthele&s;s, that kings who repre&s;ent the divine maje&s;ty of our maker, &s;hould, in holding the ballance of ju&s;tice, ever lean towards the &s;cale of mercy. That his pardon depended entirely on him&s;elf; that he &s;hould do &s;ome prai&s;e-worthy action, ere he was rein&s;tated in his favor, and that he &s;hould moreover repair every injury inflicted by him.</P>
<P>With this an&s;wer Donald was obliged to be content. At the &s;ame time am|ba&s;&s;adors arrived from Richard, Duke of York, to cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
<PB N="122" REF="030954_0122_0FEA090B74513BF8">
Scotti&s;h monarch again&s;t Henry the &s;ixth, whom he purpo&s;ed to depo&s;e&punc; and to place him&s;elf upon the throne of England; in return for which he pro|mi&s;ed to re&s;tore the lands in Northum|berland enjoyed by James's progenitors, with Berwick and all the fields adja|cent; and, to conclude, vowed a per|petual peace and amity, to be main|tained between the two realms.</P>
<P>When the amba&s;&s;adors had concluded their harangue, they thus received their an&s;wer:</P>
<P>"It is not unknown the ju&s;t title that Richard Plantagenet hath to the crown of England; but my a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould not be too precipitately granted, neither &s;hould a prince, who has &s;o long, and by con&s;ent of his kingdom, been inve&s;ted with the in&s;ignia of roy|alty, be de&s;poiled for a light cau&s;e, nor without mature deliberation; but that I refer to the wi&s;dom of the Engli&s;h nobility. I have ju&s;t rea&s;on for com|plaint
<PB N="123" REF="030954_0123_0FEA090DB408F7F8">
again&s;t my brother Henry. Fir&s;t, that he did, without provocation, in|vade my dominions, at a time when they were internally rent by civil com|motions; then al&s;o when I did &s;eek redre&s;s, he delayed to give me an an|&s;wer thereupon. If, therefore, the Duke of York, with the Lords of his faction, will keep promi&s;e, I here pledge my&s;elf, that my whole &s;trength &s;hall be exerted to drive your pre&s;ent &s;overeign from the throne, and place the crown upon his rival's head."</P>
<P>With this an&s;wer the amba&s;&s;adors took their leave, and repeated the &s;ame to their ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>In the mean time James &s;ummoned his forces to be ready on a certain day, in order to invade their ancient enemies. On his march he was met and acco&s;ted by an Engli&s;h, a creature of king Henry's, and a perfect adept in the art of lying. He was accompanied by a monk, who feigned a marvelous grav|ity,
<PB N="124" REF="030954_0124_0FEA0910D6D4A290">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pretended he was entru&s;ted with bills and commi&s;&s;ions from the Pontiff of Rome.</P>
<P>He thus addre&s;&s;ed the Caledonian Prince.</P>
<P>"It is the Pope's command, that neither the &s;overeign of Scotland, nor any of his army, &s;hall pa&s;s farther in|to England, on pain of the cur&s;es and cen&s;ures of Holy Kirk. For through the frivolous di&s;&s;entions of Chri&s;tian kings, have the Turks, (tho&s;e cruel enemies to our religion) crept daily more and more into Europe. There|fore, be all debates, battles and &s;trife &s;et a&s;ide between the di&s;ciples of our Saviour, and their utmo&s;t endeavors u&s;ed to expel the infidels, who would not only &s;poil them of their worldly liberty, but al&s;o of the word of God: on which account, I am now authori&s;ed by the Pope, to promi&s;e, that all rav|ages committed by King Henry &s;hall
<PB N="125" REF="030954_0125_0FEA091321F75BB8">
be repaired, and that ye be from this time on terms of amity."</P>
<P>James, believing nothing of deceit in the&s;e fraudulent hypocrites, obeyed the mandate, and di&s;banded his troops, but was not long returned, before he di&s;cov|ered the craft and &s;ubtilty of his foes; equally enraged at his own credulity, he collected a fre&s;h body of men, and entered the Engli&s;h borders.</P>
<P>While the&s;e tran&s;actions pa&s;&s;ed, the Duke of York led his forces again&s;t Henry, whom he attacked, routed his army, &s;lew many of his leaders, and made the king him&s;elf pri&s;oner, whom he conducted to London, where the Parliament pronounced him incapable of ruling, though they permitted him to continue the regal title, con&s;tituting Richard governor of the realm.</P>
<P>Thus was Henry, who at the ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> age of nine months, was acknowledg|ed monarch of England and France,
<PB N="126" REF="030954_0126_0FEA09157A6B98D0">
the prime of manhood deprived of both, and the prophecy made good. "<HI>That Henry of Monmouth &s;hould win, what Henry of Wind&s;or &s;hould lo&s;e.</HI>"</P>
<P>In the mean time James invaded the Engli&s;h &s;overeign's favorers in the north, and when he had won the town of Roxburgh, and laid &s;iege to the ca&s;|tle thereof, amba&s;&s;adors arrived, from his ally the Duke of York, reque&s;ting him to rai&s;e the &s;iege, as he had entire|ly carried his point.</P>
<P>James claimed the lands promi&s;ed, to which the amba&s;&s;adors replied they could not give an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Iritated at finding him&s;elf the dupe of both parties, he vowed revenge, and &s;wore he would dye the white ro&s;e of a deeper hue than its rival. Moreover, that he would not depart till the ca&s;tle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">as his own, &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the commi&s;|&s;ioners.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="030954_0127_0FEA091732A368D0">
Soon after he was joined by Donald, and a powerful reinforcement, who offered to penetrate farther into Eng|land, and by &s;everal deeds of valour, he recommended him&s;elf particularly to the notice of his monarch; his tent was pitched neare&s;t him, and nought was done without his concurrence.</P>
<P>During the &s;iege, the King was un|fortunately &s;lain by the bur&s;ting of a cannon, near which he &s;tood. His death was regretted by every one; but in a &s;hort time his place was &s;upplied by his queen, who arrived with her &s;on, and re&s;trained their grief.</P>
<P>"Here," &s;he cried, "is the offspring of him you lament; &s;hew your re|gard to your decea&s;ed Prince, by at|tacking the enemies of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, nor vainly yield to an unmanly &s;or|row."</P>
<P>The&s;e words in&s;pired the &s;oldiers; they &s;tormed the place, headed by

<P>The manu&s;cript dropped from the hand of Glencairn at the&s;e lines, by which he learned the &s;keleton was that of his long lo&s;t father. He pre&s;&s;ed the tablets to his lips with devotion, then &s;tarting from his &s;eat, he flew to the rece&s;s where he had depo&s;ited the re|mains; threw him&s;elf upon the ground, and cla&s;ped the fle&s;hle&s;s bones within his arms.

<P>This he accompli&s;hed by means of the ru&s;ty dagger he had found: then wrapping his robe, of which he di|ve&s;ted him&s;elf, round the cor&s;e, he re|turned it to that from whence it &s;prung.</P>
<P>At that moment the nightly &s;creech|owl uttered a lamentable cry, which

was an&s;wered by a deep groan that i&s;&s;ued from the corner whence he had heard the preceding ones. His blood grew clotted in his veins, he fancied the &s;pirit of his departed &s;ire had taken that method of &s;pur him to revenge.</P>

<P>ELDRED bedewed the &s;heets with his tears, placed them in his bo&s;om, and repaired to the grave of his parent. While every faculty was ab&s;orbed in contemplation, a loud &s;hriek made the vital blood grow chilly at his heart; at the &s;ame time a noi&s;e at the gate of the cavern cau&s;ed him to &s;eek the rea|&s;on. He expected to &s;ee his execution|er, but his horror was converted into &s;urpri&s;e, when he beheld a man un|armed, and advancing towards him; he de&s;cried the features of Duncan, &s;on of Carrol, who was Sir James's agent
<PB N="138" REF="030954_0138_0FEA0934A84D6DB8">
in his villainies, and an inhabitant of the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>"Good heaven!" cried Eldred, "by what &s;trange chance do I find thee here? tell me."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Su&s;pend your enquiries," returned the youth, "and con&s;ider only your &s;afety. Your pri&s;on doors are open to you, fly."</P>
<P>The &s;ilver tongues of angels could not have been more welcome to the ears of Glencairn than the&s;e words, &s;till his admiration increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>"I conjure you," &s;aid he, "inform me by what &s;trange means your kind|ne&s;s is enabled to befriend me."</P>
<P>"Briefly thus: la&s;t night, in pa&s;&s;ing through the gallery of the ca&s;tle, the buz of people in conver&s;ation attract|ed my notice. I li&s;tened, and heard Sir James and my father in earne&s;t di&s;|cour&s;e;
<PB N="139" REF="030954_0139_0FEA09365EE06758">
you, they often mentioned, and from what they &s;aid, I learned you were here in confinement, and under the latter's cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>"He had for &s;ome time a large bunch of keys, of which he is &s;o extremely careful, that in the day he kept them under lock, and at night depo&s;ited them beneath his pillow. I que&s;tioned him concerning what place they were the &s;afeguard of, but was &s;ilenced with a frown."</P>
<P>"Su&s;pend your idle curio&s;ity, nor for your life attempt to develope the &s;ecrets of my heart."</P>
<P>"This was his an&s;wer. What I heard in the gallery convinced me tho&s;e were the keys of your pri&s;on, and I have &s;pent the whole day in devi&s;ing means for your emancipation. To night my father was unexpectedly &s;um|moned by Sir James, and being at the time employed in the locker, where
<PB N="140" REF="030954_0140_0FEA0937FA8C1D08">
he kept his charge, in his ha&s;te, left the door open, and gave me the wi&s;h|ed-for opportunity of re&s;toring you to that liberty, which, but for this lucky chance, you never would have regained. Surely I am not culpable in thwarting the &s;chemes of a parent, when they are unworthy of him; and that Being, who&s;e &s;crutinizing eye can look into my very &s;oul, knows that I act but from his ju&s;t impul&s;e."</P>
<P>"What &s;avage place is this?" &s;aid Eldred, "<HI>The Haunted Cavern!</HI>" re|plied Duncan. "<HI>The Haunted Cavern,</HI> indeed!" exclaimed our hero, "Little did I think, at the time I treated the report but as the idle chimera of the pea&s;ants, that 'twas the haunt of a be|loved&mdash;."</P>
<P>He recollected him&s;elf in time, to prevent the &s;ecret of the murder e&s;cap|ing his lip. He quitted the cell, after damping the earthy pillow of his fath|er,
<PB N="141" REF="030954_0141_0FEA093C9B8CB048">
and vowing to dedicate his life un|to revenge.</P>
<P>At the door of his dungeon, he re|turned his deliverer every acknowl|edgment that a heart &s;tored with grat|itude could in&s;pire; then left him, and went to the humble dwelling of old Maud, where he begged &s;he would permit him to remain for a &s;hort time, telling her, as &s;he valued his life, not to divulge his being there.</P>
<P>Eldred determined here to make his abode, till the &s;earch, which would of cour&s;e be made, &s;hould cea&s;e; then to vi&s;it the man&s;ion of his ance&s;tors, re|late the unnatural end of his father, and invoke the tenants to arm them for revenge on his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in.</P>
<P>He pa&s;&s;ed the night in a &s;tate of anx|iety. In the morning, the &s;ame lady whom he had &s;een at the cottage on the day of his elopement with Jane, a|gain made her appearance; &s;till &s;he was
<PB N="142" REF="030954_0142_0FEA093E42D046A0">
veiled; with impatience &s;he que&s;tioned him concerning his fair cou&s;in, in which he &s;atisfied her as much as in him lay,</P>
<P>In the evening Maud, by the de&s;ire of Glencairn, repaired to the ca&s;tle, and on her return gave him the follow|ing account.</P>
<P>"I hobbled at your reque&s;t to the Baron's. I am &s;ure my old feet ach for it, and well they may; for cro&s;&s;ing the rocks that lie 'twixt here and there would brui&s;e the hoof of a camel."</P>
<P>"Spare your ob&s;ervations," inter|rupted Eldred, "and tell me what ti|dings you have brought."</P>
<P>"Spare my ob&s;ervations!" returned &s;he, "I have made none, except on my fatigue, and the badne&s;s of the road. Well, at la&s;t I arrived at Sir James's, and the fir&s;t per&s;on that I &s;aw was Duncan; knowing from the &s;ervice he had done you, and a &s;ignal &s;ervice

too, let me tell you. Sure his good|ne&s;s will make &s;ome recompence for the life of his father; never were two &s;o unlike.

Ah, my Lord, your gratitude to him cannot be too great."</P>

<P>WHEN the re&s;idents of the cottage were retired to re&s;t, Eldred wandered from thence to get a little air, of which he &s;tood in great need. Unknowingly he took his way towards the Cavern, and &s;eating him&s;elf upon a fragment of &s;tone, contemplated the beauties of nature: the moon &s;hone bright, but was now and then ob&s;cured by dark|&s;ome clouds which &s;wiftly flew acro&s;s the luminary, and &s;eemed to foretel the approaching &s;torm. Here he was &s;oon di&s;turbed by the &s;ame noi&s;e he had been accu&s;tomed to hear while in confinement and which now ap|peared to i&s;&s;ue from the cave. He &s;tarted, and perceived a figure gliding

along at no great di&s;tance. Re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to know what it was, he fol|lowed it, but in vain; the various turnings of the rocks favored the object of his pur&s;uit, who &s;oon di&s;appeared, and le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t him wrapped in wonder. He recollected a &s;imilar circum&s;tance be|faling Jane, and con&s;idered this as a &s;timulative to him to avenge his father's death.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle clock now chimed the hour of twelve, and the fa&s;t falling rain warned him to retire. He mea&s;ured his &s;teps towards the man&s;ion of Wallace, determined no longer to delay his ven|geance, and by a &s;ecret pa&s;&s;age enter|ed the building. The time con&s;pired with his purpo&s;e; the croaking raven from the mouldering turrets welcom|ed his approach; he ha&s;tened to the a|partment of his uncle, and entered it; around the couch the curtains were clo&s;ed; he undrew them, and beheld his victim buried in &s;leep, while con|&s;cience,

<P>"Behold!" he cried, "the gha&s;tly &s;pectre! See how his eye-balls glare! Alas! poor injured &s;hade, can nought make thee atonement? Oh, murdered brother!"</P>
<P>The inflamed temper of Eldred could brook no more, in rage he exclaimed:</P>
<P>"Villain! awake and meet thy doom!" Wallace opened his eyes, and &s;eeing Glencairn, the blood for&s;ook his cheek: fixed as though influenced by the ba&s;ili&s;k, he gazed upon the youth, when the power of utterance return|ing: "Gracious powers!" he cried, "who is it I &s;ee?"</P>
<P>"Thou &s;ee&s;t," &s;aid Eldred, "the offspring of the murdered Archibald. Long ha&s;t thou triumphed, and with impunity enjoyed the produce of thy crimes; vengeance is now at hand;

from me thou art de&s;tined to receive it."</P>
<P>"I &s;ubmit," quoth Wallace, "to the will of fate: my puni&s;hment is ju&s;t; but, O! I charge thee give me a lit|tle time for penitence, if heaven grants it, do not thou refu&s;e it!"</P>
<P>"Impo&s;ter!" returned Glencairn, "too well I conceive the &s;hallow arti|fice: thou woulde&s;t gain time, in the vain hope that &s;ome of thy infernal pack will re&s;cue thee, their leading blood-hound: but prepare&mdash;as well might the taken deer u&s;e per&s;ua&s;ion with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ur that holds him, as thou hope to e&s;cape my ju&s;t revenge; re|venge for a murdered parent, who&s;e death is now avenged in this."</P>
<P>He rai&s;ed his dagger, and was about to plunge it in the brea&s;t of his pro&s;|trate victim, when an oppo&s;ite door &s;uddenly opened, and a pilgrim enter|ed, crying; "Hold! hold thy hand!"</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="030954_0151_0FEA09932A811698">
Surprize called Eldred from his pur|po&s;e; he ca&s;t his looks upon the &s;tran|ger, who tearing from his face an arti|ficial beard, and dive&s;ting him&s;elf of his weeds, di&s;played the figure of a warrior, (like to that he had &s;een in his dream) who flew into his arms, ex|claiming; "My &s;on, my &s;on!"</P>
<P>So momentary had been this &s;cene, that the faculties of Eldred were total|ly &s;u&s;pended, and the unhappy Wal|lace, on &s;eeing the palmer throw off his di&s;gui&s;e, had fallen into a &s;woon.</P>
<P>"Merciful powers!" cried the a&s;ton|i&s;hed youth, "is it po&s;&s;ible I &s;ee my father?"</P>
<P>"Thou do&s;t," replied his &s;ire, for it was him: "in me thou &s;ee&s;t him, while I behold in thee a &s;on, to reward my pa&s;t misfortunes, and &s;oothe my lat|ter hours."</P>

Joy, the natural con&s;equence of &s;uch unexpected happine&s;s, having &s;ome|what &s;ub&s;ided, their thoughts were turned to the wretched criminal, who &s;till remained in&s;en&s;ate. At length, with much care, they brought him to him&s;elf, but no &s;ooner did he de&s;cry the features of his injured brother, than he relap&s;ed into his former &s;tate; nor was it but with much difficulty they could convince him 'twas not the &s;pirit, but the living Archibald, who &s;tood before him, and &s;trove by every &s;oothing me|thod, to reconcile the culprit to him|&s;elf&mdash;but ineffectual were his endeav|ors, repentance had touch'd his heart; and the barbed dart of con&s;cience for|bade him ea&s;e.</P>
<P>"In vain," &s;aid he, "you kindly try to comfort me; rea&s;on pictures me a &s;avage unnatural wretch: for not to me you owe your life&mdash;alas! long &s;ince I thought you dead! Ble&s;&s;ed be Provi|dence that has pre&s;erved you! Avarice, that cur&s;ed pa&s;&s;ion, was the &s;ource of

<P>"Remember," quoth Wallace, "my nephew Eldred, is the heir of all that I po&s;&s;e&s;s; thou, much wronged brother, cur&s;e not my memory; your &s;i&s;ter, my injured wife, was at the in&s;tigation of Duncan, by my orders, &s;ent to&mdash;"</P>

<P>ELDRED, by the de&s;ire of his fa|ther, whom we &s;hall henceforth call the Lord Glencairn, recited his adven|tures. On coming to the part which related to the hermit, he &s;hewed the ring, and que&s;tioned his &s;ire concern|ing it.</P>
<P>"That ring," returned his parent, "I pre&s;ented to the Lord John Talbot ere thou wert born. He was in Scot land on &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of State, and we formed, during his &s;tay, a &s;olemn friend&s;hip; he fell in the French wars, and I am now convinced by the arm of your Anchorite."</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="030954_0156_0FEA09C054B957F8">
Eldred then reque&s;ted an account of his own fortunes.</P>
<P>"Alas! my &s;on," he replied, "I cannot &s;atisfy you without entering in|to a detail of my &s;ufferings; misfor|tunes I will no more entitle them, &s;ince I have at la&s;t the happine&s;s of &s;eeing you again. When la&s;t the&s;e eyes be|held you, you were an infant; your mother dying in giving you birth, my whole affection centered in the dear pledge &s;he left behind her, and I thought &s;he lived again in you, on whom my heart reclined as its la&s;t prop. On that fatal night that I de|parted from my Ca&s;tle, before I moun|ted, I pre&s;&s;ed you to my heart, and in|voked a ble&s;&s;ing on you; then journey|ed towards the dwelling of Wallace, who having intimation of my de&s;ign to vi&s;it him, planted the ruffians who took me in the grove. This I learned from him&s;elf on his vi&s;iting me in the cavern. It would be &s;uperfluous to mention cir|cum&s;tances of which the manu&s;cript
<PB N="157" REF="030954_0157_0FEA09A2FA669B78">
has informed you: four tedious years did I pa&s;s in that dreary place, during which time my re&s;t was often di&s;turbed by the melancholy noi&s;es you have men|tioned. In vain were my endavors put in force to di&s;cover the cau&s;e; in vain I racked my brain, and at length con|cluded the Cavern was haunted by &s;ome re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit: full of the&s;e thoughts, my time grew doubly irk&s;ome.</P>
<P>"One &s;tormy night, the rain beat hard again&s;t my pri&s;on roof; the peals of thunder rattled o'er my head, and vivid flames of &s;ulphureous lightning fla&s;hed through the opening of the rock. Suddenly me thought, from the tremendous cra&s;h, the cave was rent in pieces: I flew to the rece&s;s where the &s;hock &s;eemed above the re&s;t; but what was my &s;urpri&s;e, when I found a part of it neare&s;t the ground torn by the fury of the elements, was broken a|way? nor can I picture the agitation of my mind, when I di&s;covered it o|pened into a long narrow pa&s;&s;age. I

con&s;idered this as the kind work of Providence, and falling on my knees, returned thanks to the Almighty, who thus &s;eemed to promi&s;e me my liberty.</P>
<P>"I extingui&s;hed my lamp, not know|ing where the path might lead me to. I felt my way for &s;ome time, and at length de&s;cried a glimmering light, which made me more cautious how I proceeded. On my nearer approach, I found it was diffu&s;ed by a lamp, &s;u&s;|pended by a long iron chain from the roof of a cave, round which were &s;cat|tered, brea&s;t-plaits cuira&s;&s;es, helmets, in &s;hort, every implement of war. At the far end &s;at the figure of a man ca|&s;ed in &s;teel, and his beaver being up gave me an opportunity of &s;eeing his face, which was as pale, as death. I was much a&s;toni&s;hed, nay, &s;uch was the effect of my &s;urpri&s;e, that I con&s;id|ered him as &s;omething &s;upernatural.</P>
<P>"On recollection, I thought my be&s;t way would be to return to my dun|geon,

and tarry a fitter opportunity. I did &s;o, and waited with impatience the return of the following evening. As &s;oon as it arrived I &s;ought the pa&s;|&s;age again, and in the cave beheld the &s;ame figure as before. I &s;tood for &s;ome time gazing on him, my &s;ituation being &s;uch as gave me a full view of him without fear of di&s;covery. Sud|denly he &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and van|i&s;hed through an outlet that was near him. After a time, finding all quiet, I ventured out, but at that in&s;tant he re|turned, and &s;eeing me, un&s;heathed his &s;word and made towards me. Fortu|nately the place was &s;o well &s;tored with weapons, that I &s;oon armed my&s;elf, and after an ob&s;tinate combat, &s;tretch|ed him drowned in blood upon the earth.</P>
<P>"Compa&s;&s;ion prompted me to give him every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power. I unbuckled his brea&s;t-plate, and endea|vored to &s;taunch his wound, but he pu&s;hed me from him."</P>

"Your care" he &s;aid, is vain: even now the Angel of death hovers around me, and will &s;hortly clo&s;e my eyes for ever! Misfortunes, biting want have leagued me with a band of robbers; li&s;ten to my &s;ufferings and pity me.!</P>
<P>"I am &s;on to the late Sir William Lovel, England claims my birth: in the fruitful county of Norfolk I drew my fir&s;t breath, and received the fo&s;|tering care of a fond father; the tender &s;olicitude with which he watched my juvenile years, can never be oblitera|ted from the tablets of my memory, &s;o long as I po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of reflec|tion.</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t &s;eventeen years of my life pa&s;&s;ed without any incident wor|thy relating, when one of our tenants, named Brackenbury, was le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t guardian to the daughter of a decea&s;ed friend, who had re&s;ided in a di&s;tant part of the kingdom.

I therefore one day, on my re|turn from riding, called at Brackenbu|ry's to reque&s;t a draught of water, but in hopes of beholding his charge.</P>
<P>"I alighted by his de&s;ire, and was conducted into the cottage, where the fir&s;t object that attracted my notice was his lovely ward, Lauretta. Never did I behold &s;o charming a creature; but if I was captivated by her beauty, I was much more &s;o by her engaging mode&s;t mein, which had &s;uch an effect upon me, I from that moment became en&s;laved.</P>
<P>"I vi&s;ited my adored Lauretta every day; I di&s;clo&s;ed my pa&s;&s;ion, and had the &s;atisfaction to find &s;he returned my love: but Brackenbury, who was a man of penetration, &s;oon di&s;covered the cau&s;e of my vi&s;its, and threatened,

<P>"I left the cottage in a &s;tate little &s;hort&punc; of phrenzy, from which I be|came gloomy and re&s;erved; not only my mind, but my body was infected; I could take no nouri&s;hment, &s;leep for|&s;ook my pillow, and my days were mi&s;|erable.

<P>"Having di&s;engaged my&s;elf from the &s;tupor wherein &s;urpri&s;e had ca&s;t me, rage &s;ucceeded&punc; and I laid my hand upon my &s;word, with an intention to offer him a &s;acrifice to filial duty and affection; for the memory of my moth|er, although &s;he died ere I was old e|nough to feel her lo&s;s, was highly re|vered by me. He perceiving my de|&s;ign,

<P>"Turn," cried he, "yon ba&s;tard forth, and if he ever pre&s;umes to come within the&s;e walls again, death &s;hall be his puni&s;hment."</P>
<P>"It was in vain to make re&s;i&s;tance, as his followers were much too nu|merous for my dome&s;tics to cope with; I therefore &s;ubmitted to my de&s;tiny, and left him ma&s;ter of what indeed was mine. Thus was I &s;tripped of every thing, and &s;hut out from the very man|&s;ion, which bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;hort hour before ow|ned me for its Lord!</P>
<P>"At fir&s;t I thought of making an appeal to the law; but too true I was the fruit of an alliance, which, though rendered firm by mutual affection, ne|ver was &s;anctioned by the matrimonial rites. I al&s;o thought of vi&s;iting my beloved Lauretta, but honor forbade me; to pre&s;ent a beggar to her arms

<P>"I &s;et forward, determined to turn my back on Norfolk for ever. I trav|elled the whole night and the following day, &s;carce taking any refre&s;hment. I entered Scotland, and was pa&s;&s;ing near this &s;pot, when my way was in|terrupted by a man, who brandi&s;hing his &s;word, bade me deliver my money. Unu&s;ed to be commanded, I refu&s;ed, on which he furiou&s;ly attacked me; but I, aware of him, un&s;heathed my weapon and e&s;caped the blow. Long we fought, without the lea&s;t advantage on either &s;ide, till a deep wound which he received in the &s;word arm, cau&s;ed him to drop his falchion.</P>
<P>"My life is yours," he exclaimed, "take it!"</P>
<P>"I replied, no! although the un|provoked manner in which you attack|ed me would authorize &s;uch a deed, yet

<P>"He was about to return his thanks, when I ob&s;erved a body of men i&s;&s;ue from a grove at no great di&s;tance, and ha&s;ten towards us. On drawing near|er, and perceiving their a&s;&s;ociate woun|ded, they were about to &s;acrifice me to their rage; when he generou&s;ly cried hold! and learn, though your profe&s;&s;ion compels you to dive&s;t the benighted tra|veller, to re&s;pect valor! Henceforth con&s;ider this young man as my friend"</P>
<P>"I found by the deference paid him, he was their captain. His hurt requi|red a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and &s;eeing I was fatigued he begged I would accompany him to his cave, where I &s;hould be welcome to pa&s;s the night. Unable to &s;u&s;pect a per&s;on who had behaved &s;o nobly, I ac|cepted his invitation.</P>

"We walked till we came to a group of lofty rocks, and having wandered about half a mile in the mid&s;t of them, entered this place. The chief having had his wound dre&s;&s;ed ordered &s;ome refre&s;hment. In a minute the table was covered with all &s;orts of delicate viands and rich wines, which, notwith|&s;tanding &s;o much in want of, I hardly ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>"Having fini&s;hed our repa&s;t we re|tired. I aro&s;e early in the morning, but found the captain up before me: he in|formed me he had, &s;pite of the angui&s;h of his wound, left his bed in compli|ment to me. Our breakfa&s;t ended, he de&s;ired all, &s;ave my&s;elf, to retire. As &s;oon as they were gone, he thus addre&s;|&s;ed me:</P>
<P>"Stranger, you will doubtle&s;s won|der, in a place like this, to find a being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of feeling; but let this teach you never to judge the heart by the out|ward appearance, and learn, that a

<P>"I thanked him for his kindne&s;s, but a&s;&s;ured him my griefs were not within his power to cure. He an&s;wered, his only inducement for noticing my mel|ancholy was the hope of being able to di&s;pel it. Convinced by his manner he meant me well, I re&s;olved to tru&s;t him with my hi&s;tory, which I had no &s;oon|er fini&s;hed, than in a fit of pa&s;&s;ion he cried, "Ju&s;t heaven? are &s;uch villains, the wor&s;t of robbers, permitted to e&s;|cape the la&s;h of cen&s;ure and rigour of the law, while mi&s;erable wretches like

<P>"FAINTLY can I picture the &s;en|&s;ations at that moment, in which all remembrance of my pa&s;t &s;orrows were for a time &s;u&s;pended. The mi&s;t of night was fleeting fa&s;t, while in the ea&s;t the ruddy tinted &s;ky announced the arrival of the god of day, and ca&s;t its influence on the bo&s;om of the ocean. The air after &s;o long confinement I could ill bear: &s;till the nece&s;&s;ity of my quick departure gave me fre&s;h vigour, and urged me on. I travelled towards my ca&s;tle, and at length the turrets of my man&s;ion &s;hewed them&s;elves, when the appearance of an aged pea&s;ant cau|&s;ed me to make towards him, and I quickly recognized his features; his

life had been &s;pent in the va&s;&s;alage of my ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>"I acco&s;ted him as a &s;tranger, de|termined to know whether the remem|brance of Glencairn obtained a place in his mind.</P>
<P>"Friend," quoth I, "I have travel|led <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ar: &s;ay, does the &s;pring of ho&s;pi|tality influence the portal of yon edi|fice?"</P>

<P>"Indeed!" an&s;wered I, "and was it always &s;o?"</P>

<P>"Think me not, Eldred, guilty of vanity, in repeating the words of the poor fellow; for that, of all pa&s;&s;ions, is mo&s;t de&s;erving our contempt&mdash;but let this teach thee how to act the prop|er part of man.

<P>"I ventured to di&s;cover my&s;elf, and his joy at &s;eeing me was extreme, but was &s;uddenly checked by recollecting where I was.</P>
<P>"My Lord," he cried, "fly this ho|&s;tile place! &s;hould you be known, your life would an&s;wer."</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="030954_0178_0FEA0964AB91F9F8">
"Hold!" I interrupted, "for my life I care not; know you any tidings of my &s;on?"</P>
<P>"I know but little," returned the pea&s;ant, "'twas here believed you were a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated; a &s;hort time after, Sir James &s;ent for your &s;on to Edin|burgh, and garri&s;oned the ca&s;tle with his own followers, di&s;charging yours.

<P>"What could I think? From his in|human treatment to me, what could I &s;uppo&s;e but you were no more?</P>
<P>"Almo&s;t di&s;tracted, I knew not what to do.

undertaking a pilgrimage to the Holy|land. I therefore provided my&s;elf with a habit for the purpo&s;e, and commen|ced my journey, having &s;worn the old man never to divulge his knowledge of my exi&s;tence, and was accompanied by his good wi&s;hes,</P>
<P>"Long, long and tedious was the way: unprotected from the &s;corching heat of the A&s;iatic &s;un, I wandered, and having reached the de&s;tined &s;pot, performed my mi&s;&s;ion. I then traver|&s;ed the ea&s;tern continent, &s;till in Pal|mer's weeds, and afterwards return|ed to Europe, mo&s;t part of which I cro&s;&s;ed. At Italy, I met with &s;ome more of my own calling, who pro|po&s;ed making the tour of England. I accompanied them, and being &s;o near my native country, I was by an invol|untary impul&s;e compelled to vi&s;it it. I &s;ought the ca&s;tle of Wallace, and claimed entertainment there; I learned from the conver&s;ation of the dome&s;tics, you had been reared by your uncle un|til

<P>"I la&s;t night threw a&s;ide my di&s;|gui&s;e, and entered his room: he in|&s;tantly remembered my features, but &s;uppo&s;ing me dead, imagination cau&s;ed him to con&s;ider me as the &s;pirit of the brother he had &s;o much wronged. I had this night retired to the clo&s;et ad|joining his apartment, with an inten|tion to di&s;clo&s;e my&s;elf, and &s;eek to &s;oothe him to repentance, when the words I heard convinced me you were my &s;on; and I will no more complain of the &s;ickle goddess, &s;ince you are re|&s;tored to me."</P>
<P>Here the Lord Glencairn concluded his narration.</P>
<P>On the following day the cavern was &s;earched; they removed the rubbi&s;h and entered the pa&s;&s;age; the noi&s;es which had been heard were again re|peated.
<PB N="181" REF="030954_0181_0FEA09B1521541D8">
At length they di&s;covered &s;ev|eral cells, and delivered innumerable captives who had long groaned in con|finement, and who&s;e appearance ac|counted for the di&s;turbances experien|ced by Eldred and his father, while in confinement. They moreover &s;ecured the banditti, and re&s;igned them to the rigour of the law. In &s;hort, ju&s;tice was again practi&s;ed, and the whole neighbourhood rung with the names of Eldred and Glencairn.</P>
<P>It is now proper to mention Donald, whom we left a laurelled conquerer at Roxburgh. Flu&s;hed with conque&s;t, and rendered more arbitrary from the fevorable opinion entertained of him by the queen, he repaired to the Ca&s;|tle; and Jane &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in her refu|&s;al of his hand, he re&s;olved by force to make her his. His confe&s;&s;or, who for the con&s;ideration of a little yellow dro&s;s, clean&s;ed his &s;oul, and gave him a ab&s;olu|tion, appeared a proper per&s;on. Choo|&s;ing the dead of night, by force he en|tered
<PB N="182" REF="030954_0182_0FEA09CFEB6B6EC8">
the chamber of his intended vic|tim, attended by his &s;acerdotal friend and bade her yield her hand.</P>
<P>The unhappy maid upon her knees, intreated death in preference; conjur|ing him by every &s;olemn argument to refrain from his de&s;ign. But as effec|ually might the trembling lamb plead for life to the voracious wolf, as &s;he have &s;oftened Donald's inflexible mind.</P>
<P>"Thy prayers are vain, weak maid," he cried, "I am preparing for thy hap|pine&s;s. What can&s;t thou wi&s;h for? If power, my wide domains will give thee that, accompanied by wealth; if love, behold me now, though with the &s;mooth and artful tale of hypocrites I cannot plead my pa&s;&s;ion, yet at thy feet I free|ly lay my heart."</P>
<P>"Hold!" exclaimed Jane, "Di&s;&s;em|bling villain? too well I &s;ee through thy poor artifice: but here, in the &s;ight

<P>"Indeed, my &s;aucy dame?" return|ed the Baron, "we'll try thy boa&s;ted per&s;everance. Come father, execute your office."</P>
<P>The prie&s;t had ju&s;t begun the cere|mony, when they were &s;tartled by loud and reiterated jars again&s;t the ca&s;tle gate. Donald him&s;elf appeared care|le&s;s of this unexpected intru&s;ion, and again ordered the monk to proceed. He did &s;o, and the irrevocable ring was about to be placed on the tremb|ling hand of Jane, when the chamber door was violently bur&s;t open, and an armed warrior &s;tood before the a&s;ton|i&s;hed Donald!</P>
<P>"Mon&s;ter!" &s;aid the &s;tranger, "re|lea&s;e the lady, and oppo&s;e the &s;trength of one more equal to thee!"</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="030954_0184_0FEA09BC04144020">
So &s;aying, he immediately a&s;&s;ailed the Lord of the I&s;les: their &s;words ca&s;t round a dreadful gleam, and victory &s;eemed doubtful; when fortune, turn|ing her wheel out of its u&s;ual track, a thing too rare, favored the ju&s;ter cau&s;e; the unknown cavalier di&s;armed his an|tagoni&s;t, who was now entirely in his power.</P>
<P>"Thy life is fairly mine," exclaimed the conqueror, "but let the compa&s;|&s;ion I extend to thee, teach thee to practice mercy to thy enemies. Live and repent!"</P>
<P>Jane, who had been an anxious &s;pec|tator of the combat, was wrapped in &s;ilent gratitude, when the &s;tranger rai&s;ing his beaver, di&s;overed the face of her loved Glencairn. The &s;udden change from deep de&s;pair to joy depri|ved her of all power, and &s;he &s;unk in|&s;en&s;ate into the arms of Eldred.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="030954_0185_0FEA09C5CAD9F058">
By this time the Lord Glencairn joined his &s;on; they u&s;ed their endeav|ours in re&s;toring Jane, and at length &s;ucceeded; when the latter introduced her to his father, who received him with a parental affection.</P>
<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the fol|lowers of the two Noblemen entirely vanqui&s;hed the retainers of Donald; they &s;earched the ca&s;tle, and gave liber|ty to Edric, who was joyfully received by the young Lord Eldred; and in a dun|geon had found Andrew, but in a very weak condition.</P>
<P>"Here," &s;ays one of the officers, "is a pri&s;oner, but he &s;eems to be in &s;o bad a &s;tate, that were he relea&s;ed, he would &s;carce be able to leave the place."</P>
<P>"You are mi&s;taken," replied the Squire, "were my pri&s;on doors now open, notwith&s;tanding the pain the&s;e &s;teel ornaments with which they have honored me, have cau&s;ed, I could &s;kip

<P>They liberated and conducted him to his ma&s;ter; his grote&s;que appear|ance excited a &s;mile on the features of his &s;pectators: his red beard was grown to an enormous length, and from the dirt which was gathered therein, gave him more the re&s;emblance to a demon than a human being. Immediately on his entrance, he cried; "Ah, my Lord, is it po&s;&s;ible it is you? Alas? you thought your cares were all over when la&s;t you quitted this infernal dwelling, but you are &s;o precipitate; recollect an old proverb that I oft repeated to you; <HI>An ounce of di&s;cretion is worth a pound of wit!</HI> By the ma&s;s there &s;tands old Plu|to, alias Donald! the la&s;t time I &s;aw him <HI>he looked as hot as if he had been eating Tewk&s;bury mu&s;tard.</HI>"</P>

<P><PB N="187" REF="030954_0187_0FEA097DA79A1B78">
"Hey! what! Oh, a gho&s;t! a gho&s;t!"</P>
<P>"No my hone&s;t fellow," returned Archibald, "I am no gho&s;t!"</P>
<P>"Huzza! huzza!" cried the over|joyed Squire, "he's alive."</P>

<P>"Not in the army, I hope my Lord," interrupted Andrew, believe me, I &s;hall make but a pitiful &s;oldier. I have &s;o great an antipathy to &s;teel, that I would not be taylor to his maje&s;ty, merely becau&s;e I &s;hould have been&punc; obliged to handle a needle."</P>

"I thank you, my Lord," replied his &s;ervant, "that po&s;t will ju&s;t &s;uit me."</P>
<P>They now prepared to depart, and having &s;entenced the prie&s;t to perpet|ual impri&s;onment, and pardoned Don|ald, (who lived many years a &s;incere penitent) they pur&s;ued their journey to Aberdeen&s;hire.

the viel; but finding I would not un|der&s;tand her, &s;he &s;poke more plainly, I then peremptorily refu&s;ed; &s;ince when &s;he endeavored by every rigorous means to compel me, but in vain. I rather would have fallen a &s;acrifice at the altar, than offer a divided heart to heaven.</P>
<P>"My life was now become a burden to me, when I recollected an old french &s;oldier, who daily implored charity at the grate. I re&s;olved on bribing him; I told him frankly the treatment I had received, and promi&s;ed him a pur&s;e of gold, if he would a&s;&s;i&s;t me in making my e&s;cape, and that he would be un|der the garden wall in the du&s;k of the evening. He a&s;&s;ured me of his fideli|ity, vowed to die in my &s;ervice, and moreover offered to accompany me till I was a&s;&s;ured of my &s;afety.</P>
<P>"At &s;un &s;et I equipped my&s;elf with a Friar's habit&punc; which he had furni&s;h|ed me with in the cour&s;e of the day,

and was &s;uffered by the porter to depart without the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion. My tru&s;|ty &s;oldier was waiting for me, and we took a long leave of the convent.</P>
<P>"He procured me a pa&s;&s;age in a ve&s;&s;el bound for Scotland, for which place I embarked, after having reward|ed him, and landed &s;afely in my native country. I in&s;tantly repaired to the cottage of Maud, where I have &s;ince tarried, and con&s;oled my&s;elf by being near you, my daughter. I am the per&s;on who was introduced to you by the good old woman, on the morning of your elopement: I am the object who cau&s;ed your terror at the cavern, by addre&s;&s;ing you, and who have &s;ince beheld your cou&s;in Eldred there. He &s;ought to overtake me, but the mazes and windings of the rocks favored my flight, and I e&s;caped him.</P>
<P>"My rea&s;on for the&s;e walks was, that as I was fearful of being &s;een, which I mu&s;t have been, had I ventur|ed

out by day light, I embraced the hour of darkne&s;s to enjoy the fre&s;h in|vigorating air. On the rumour of Sir James's decea&s;e, of Eldred &s;ucceeding him in the e&s;tate, and that my brother lived, I ha&s;tened to the ca&s;tle. Time had not &s;o much altered the lineaments of a &s;i&s;ter, but that I was known, and received with &s;uch unfeigned marks of affection, that a life of gratitude will &s;carce repay what I owe."</P>
<P>"No more of that," &s;aid Archibald, "our hours of mi&s;ery, I tru&s;t, are pa&s;t; be tho&s;e to come, of joy!"</P>
<P>In a few days Eldred's me&s;&s;enger re|turned, announcing the arrival of fa|ther Ambro&s;e. The young Lord hur|ried out from the company to welcome him, and pre&s;ently returned leading in the hermit, who no &s;ooner entered the apartment, than he &s;unk lifele&s;s upon the floor.</P>

All ran to him, and were bu&s;y in re|viving him: at la&s;t they &s;ucceeded in their endeavors, and on &s;eeing Lady Wallace, he exclaimed, "Gracious heaven! Matilda!"</P>
<P>The well known voice &s;truck con|viction to her heart, and notwith&s;tand|ing the many years they had been ab|&s;ent from each other, &s;he &s;traightway knew her Alan! her beloved Alan! whom &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed to have peri&s;hed in the Gallic wars.</P>
<P>They renewed their vows of ever|la&s;ting love. Glencairn welcomed him as the companion of his youth; while Jane and Eldred &s;tood wrapped in won|der at the &s;cene.</P>
<P>They all removed to the ca&s;tle of Glencairn, where, after the tedious in|terval of a year from the death of Wal|lace, Alan Duntrone received the hand of his widow, and at the &s;ame time El|dred was ble&s;t with his lovely Jane.</P>

The antique pile now rung with mirth and fe&s;tivity. Bonfires blazed; the mantling juice of the grape &s;welled on the ho&s;pitable board; the pliant fingers of the bards flew o'er the &s;trings of the &s;oul-&s;ubduing lyre, while their tongues alternately rehear&s;ed the deeds of wariors, and con&s;tancy of maidens.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle of Wallace was convert|ed into an alm's hou&s;e, where age and infancy met with a &s;anctuary from the iron gripe of indigence, and of which the philo&s;opher Andrew was con&s;tituted governor.</P>
<P>Edric was maintained as the Squire of Eldred; Duncan, the &s;on of Car|rol&punc; as his &s;teward: Maud enjoyed a con&s;iderable pen&s;ion from the pur&s;e of Eldred. In &s;hort, no one who had con|tributed to his welfare went unreward|ed.</P>
