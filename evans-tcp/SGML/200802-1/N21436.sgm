<P>THE great de&s;ign of religious wor&s;hip, as in&s;tituted by the Mo&s;t High, for the benefit of a revolted world of mankind, is, under its enlighten|ing and transforming influence, to impre&s;s upon the mind a proper &s;en&s;e of the glorious Deity; to a&s;&s;imilate mankind to a nearer re&s;emblance of the perfections of God, and hereby to qualify them for the final enjoyment of him.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="028160_0003_0FD6D814C9700BD0">
Divinely in&s;tituted wor&s;hip, may be con&s;idered as a medium of intercour&s;e between the Supreme Author of all being, and his intelligent creatures; in and by which they manife&s;t a &s;en&s;e of their de|pendance upon him, their love, e&s;teem and venera|tion for him; and by which the devout wor&s;hipper on the wings of faith and prayer, a&s;cends to the throne of his grace, and receives the tokens of di|vine love and favour, by an increa&s;e of the knowl|edge of him, and fervour of affection towards him.</P>
<P>The &s;elected pa&s;&s;ages of in&s;piration may proper|ly direct our view and inquiry, with re&s;pect to the proper object and in&s;titutor of all religious wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>The manner in which acceptable wor&s;hip is to be performed, both as it re&s;pects the Jewi&s;h relig|ion, under the law, and the Chri&s;tian religion, un|der the go&s;pel; as al&s;o the powerful motives af|forded to the devout wor&s;hipper.</P>
<P>An&s;werable to the intere&s;ting and important ends of religious wor&s;hip, are the apprehen&s;ions thereof manife&s;ted in my text.</P>
<P>Although the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of in&s;piration are &s;epa|rated, at a di&s;tance, in the &s;acred pages, yet they have a near relation to each other, as to the impor|tant object to which they refer. The former pa&s;|&s;age contains the pious breathings of King Solo|mon, who was the wi&s;e&s;t of all men: The latter are the words of one, greater than Solomon, the Prince of the kings of the earth, the Son of God, the Saviour of the world. The former pa&s;&s;age di|rects our views to that religious wor&s;hip, enjoined by the God of I&s;rael, upon his people, under the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation. The latter, to the more &s;pi|ritual wor&s;hip, enjoined upon all Chri&s;tians, under the go&s;pel.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="028160_0004_0FD6D81C95326058">
I am, fir&s;t, led to &s;ome ob&s;ervations re&s;pecting the religious wor&s;hip, enjoined by God, upon his people, under the Jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation. In order to enable us, the better to under&s;tand the true mean|ing, and great propriety of the expre&s;&s;ions, made u&s;e of by Solomon, in his invocation of the God of I&s;|rael, it is to be ob&s;erved that the temple built by Solomon (which, with regard to its curious work|man&s;hip, the richne&s;s of the materials of which it con&s;i&s;ted, the overlayings of gold with which it was adorned, and the u&s;e and de&s;ign for which it was, in all re&s;pects adapted) was the mo&s;t extraor|dinary and magnificent &s;tructure, ever effected by human art. This temple being built by Solomon, according to divine appointment, at Jeru&s;alem, was to &s;ucceed the former u&s;e of the Tabernacle, which according to divine directions, given to Mo&s;es, he had cau&s;ed to be erected in the wilderne&s;s: In which were depo&s;ited the Ark of God, the two ta|bles of the law, Aaron's Rod, and the pot of man|na. In this Tabernacle the great Jehovah was plea&s;ed to vouch&s;afe his gracious pre&s;ence, in the vi&s;ible tokens and manife&s;tations thereof, to I&s;rael in the wilderne&s;s; guiding and directing their cour&s;|es and movements, by a pillar of cloud by day, and a pillar of fire, by night, which manife&s;ted it&s;elf over the Tabernacle, in which was the Ark of God. The motion and the re&s;t of the cloud gave the &s;ignal, when the children of I&s;rael were to march forward, and when they were to pitch their tents. And we have it ob&s;erved, that "when the Ark &s;et forward, Mo&s;es &s;aid, Ri&s;e up, Lord, and let thine enemies be &s;cattered, and let them that hate thee flee before thee. And when it re&s;ted, he

&s;aid, return, O Lord, unto the many thou&s;and's of I&s;rael.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. x. 35, 36.</NOTE> The Tabernacle was a moveable tent, while I&s;rael journeyed in the wilderne&s;s; and was, as it were, the Palace of the Mo&s;t High, the dwell|ing of the God of I&s;rael; in which the I&s;raelites performed the chief of their religious exerci&s;es, of|fered their &s;acrifices and wor&s;hipped God. But the &s;olemn wor&s;hip of God was, for the future, to be performed at Jeru&s;alem." "For the Lord hath cho&s;|en Zion" He hath de&s;ired it for his habitation: This is my re&s;t forever: Here will I dwell, for I have de&s;ired it;"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxxxii. 13, 14;</NOTE>Referring to the city Jeru&s;alem, where was mount Zion, and mount Moriah, on which the Temple of Solomon was erected; in which for the future, the Ark of the God of I&s;rael was to be fixed. The Ark was the &s;ymbol of God's powerful and glorious pre&s;ence, from which he was wont to put forth, and manife&s;t his &s;trength, on the behalf of his people, when de&s;ired, or need|ed by them. The above ob&s;ervations may enable us the better, to apprehend the meaning, and great propriety of the expre&s;&s;ions made u&s;e of, by Solomon, in the text.</P>
<P>Solomon having, at immen&s;e expen&s;e, and with exqui&s;ite art, fini&s;hed and adorned the Tem|ple, according to the directions of the Mo&s;t High, to be the &s;tated place for the &s;olemn wor&s;hip of God; he proceeds to notice the goodne&s;s of God, manife&s;ted in the promi&s;e made to David his father, and in the fulfilment thereof with re&s;pect to him|&s;elf; in his being &s;eated in the kingdom, and hav|ing erected an hou&s;e to the name of the Lord, and
<PB N="9" REF="028160_0006_0FD6D8224DB56258">
having put therein the Ark, wherein was the cove|nant of the Lord which he made with I&s;rael. Af|ter this, king Solomon goes on to pre&s;ent his ex|cellent prayer, as expre&s;&s;ed in the preceding part of the chapter; at the conclu&s;ion of which, he &s;aith, as in my text: "Now therefore ari&s;e, O Lord God, into thy re&s;ting place, thou and the Ark of thy &s;trength." As if he had &s;aid, O Thou who &s;itte&s;t in the heavens, ari&s;e from the throne of thy glory, and come down into this place, which thou ha&s;t appointed for thy con&s;tant and fixed habitation; from which thou wilt not any more remove, as for|merly thou ha&s;t done, from place to, place: Thou and the Ark of thy &s;trength; or thou <HI>in</HI> the Ark of thy &s;trength, as it may be rendered.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t glory of the Temple was tho&s;e ex|traordinary marks of the divine favour with which it was honoured; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR>1. The Ark of the cove|nant, in which were put the two Tables of the Law; and the Mercy-Seat, which was upon it; from whence the divine Oracles were given out, by an audible voice, as often as God was con&s;ulted in behalf of his people. 2. The Shechinah, or the divine pre&s;ence, manife&s;ted by a vi&s;ible cloud, re&s;t|ing over the Mercy-Seat. 3. The Urim and Thummim, by which the High Prie&s;t con&s;ulted God, in difficult ca&s;es, relating to the public inter|e&s;t of the nation. 4. The Holy Fire, which came down from heaven, at the con&s;ecration of the Tem|ple. Such were the &s;ignal, and vi&s;ible marks of the divine pre&s;ence in the Temple, for the be&s;tow|ment of which, Solomon pre&s;ented his &s;ervent pe|tition, at the con&s;ecration of it. In an&s;wer to which, we have it expre&s;&s;ed, as follows "Now when
<PB N="10" REF="028160_0007_0FD6D8284EBF7B70">
Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and con&s;umed the burnt|offering and the &s;acrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the hou&s;e."</P>
<P>From what is related, we learn the exalted ap|prehen&s;ions of the glorious Deity, which in&s;pired the brea&s;t of King Solomon, and &s;hould animate the devotion of all true wor&s;hippers.</P>
<P>The glorious Deity is the only proper object of all religious wor&s;hip: And his people are forbid to wor&s;hip any other God: And all true and ac|ceptable wor&s;hip is in&s;tituted by him." "In vain do ye wor&s;hip me, &s;ays our Saviour to the Phari&s;ees, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> v. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>Man who receives being and continual &s;upport from the agency and plea&s;ure of the Mo&s;t High, is obligated to perform all acts of religious wor&s;hip to him, only in the manner which he hath pre&s;crib|ed; in obedience to his commands, and to promote his glory. And it is pertinent to ob&s;erve, that the external mode pre&s;cribed for the wor&s;hip of God, has been different, in different periods of the church, under the Law, and under the Go&s;pel. The re|ligious in&s;titutions enjoined upon the Jews, relating to the Temple &s;ervice, all their religious rites, had reference to the glorious Deity, as ju&s;t and holy; and to mankind, in his lap&s;ed &s;tate, as &s;inful and polluted. They repre&s;ented God as reconcileable to &s;inful man, who had broken covenant with God, his Maker; and that God becomes reconcileable, only, through a Mediator, agreeably to what was compri&s;ed in that early promi&s;e, <HI>that the &s;eed of the
<PB N="11" REF="028160_0008_0FD6D7F9CD4F3618">
woman &s;hould brui&s;e the Serpent's head.</HI> The rich ble&s;&s;ings, included in this promi&s;e, have been grad|ually unfolding, and ripening for complete fulfil|ment, from the early days of the Church. From the promi&s;e being fir&s;t given out to Adam, this promi&s;e has engaged the faith, and animated the devotion of God's true I&s;rael, in all ages of the Church. As men have ever been under an obliga|tion to acknowledge the &s;upreme dominion of God over them, and whatever belongs to them; and as there have always been found per&s;ons, who have con&s;cientiou&s;ly acquitted them&s;elves of this duty, it is probable that there have always been &s;acrifices in the world. Adam and his &s;ons, Noah and his de&s;cendants, Abraham and his po&s;terity, Job and Melchizedec, before the Law, have offered to God real &s;acrifices. But the Law a&s;certained the quality, the number, and other circum&s;tances of the &s;acrifices, which, before, were arbitrary. A great variety of laws, termed ceremonial and judicial, were given to Mo&s;es, to be ob&s;erved by the I&s;rael|ites, in addition to the moral Law, which were limited, as to their obligation, to the Jewi&s;h Econ|omy; all of which had their u&s;es, and were wi&s;ely adapted, by the righteous Law-giver, to an&s;wer the ends de&s;igned; many of which laws re&s;pected &s;acrifices and pollutions, were typical, pointing out the pollutions of human nature, and the nece&s;&s;ity of atonement. Thus the Temple it&s;elf, and the Ark, with other things contained in the Temple, the Mercy-Seat, the Altar, &amp;c. together with many of the &s;acrifices and &s;ervices thereof, were typical of Chri&s;t and the Go&s;pel Church, which they were to precede and repre&s;ent. All the&s;e &s;acrifices were no
<PB N="12" REF="028160_0009_0FD6D82CB5049608">
other than prophecies and figures of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the true Chri&s;tian &s;acrifice; containing the whole &s;ub&s;tance, of which the ancient &s;acrifices were but &s;hadows and repre&s;entatives. Thus the Jewi&s;h Di&s;pen&s;ation, although more ob&s;cure than that of the Go&s;pel, was &s;uch as the wi&s;dom of God &s;aw fit to appoint, to go before, and prepare the way for the latter; and was &s;ufficient to fix the faith of the true wor&s;hipper, in the promi&s;e of God, for par|don, ju&s;tification, and eternal life, through Chri&s;t, the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, of who&s;e appearance here upon earth, they had longing expectation. "God having provided &s;ome better thing for us, that they without us &s;hould not be made perfect."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. xi. 40.</NOTE></P>
<P>Which leads me to &s;hift our views from the Jew|i&s;h Di&s;pen&s;ation, to that of the Go&s;pel, to the open|ing and commencement of which happy era, the la&s;t branch of my text has a &s;pecial reference.</P>
<P>"Je&s;us &s;aith unto her, woman believe me, the hour cometh, when ye &s;hall, neither in this moun|tain, nor yet at Jeru&s;alem, wor&s;hip the Father. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true wor|&s;hippers &s;hall wor&s;hip the Father in &s;pirit and in truth; for the Father &s;eeketh &s;uch to wor&s;hip him."</P>
<P>The time having now arrived, when, according to the eternal purpo&s;e of grace, the types and prophecies which pointed out the coming of Chri&s;t, the true Me&s;&s;iah, &s;hould have their fulfilment, by his actual advent; when all the ceremonial rites &s;hould cea&s;e, under the &s;piritual reign of Chri&s;t's kingdom; when the typical wor&s;hip of the Jews &s;hould be &s;hifted, under Chri&s;t the great Antitype,
<PB N="13" REF="028160_0010_0FD6D82D963345F8">
to the more pure and &s;piritual Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip: At the appointed time, and for the&s;e glorious pur|po&s;es, Chri&s;t made his per&s;onal appearance here up on earth. Not with that external pomp and grand|eur which the Jews were led, vainly, to expect; but in the low and humble form of a &s;ervant. Not in a manner adapted to attract the admiration of the world, and gratify the ambitious expectation of the Jews, by freeing them from the Roman yoke, and conferring upon them the riche&s;t honours and &s;plen|dors of this world; but as was prophe&s;ied of him, he appeared meek and lowly, to humble the pride of men, and to &s;et up his &s;piritual kingdom in their hearts. To effect the benevolent de&s;ign of his com|ing into the world, Chri&s;t frequently introduced and mingled him&s;elf with per&s;ons of different cla&s;&s;es and characters; timing his di&s;cour&s;es and ob&s;ervations, as occa&s;ion pre&s;ented, in &s;uch a manner as was be&s;t adapted to excite their attention, and fix their faith in him, as the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
<P>In the pro&s;ecution of the benevolent de&s;ign, for which Chri&s;t came into the world, the Evangeli&s;t informs us, that, leaving Judea and going to Gali|lee, he took occa&s;ion to pa&s;s through Samaria; that he came to a city of Samaria, which is called Sy|char, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his &s;on Jo&s;eph, where was Jacob's well; and that he, being wearied with his journey, &s;at upon the well; unto which there came a woman of Samaria, to draw water; which gave occa&s;ion to the confer|ence between her and our Saviour, which proved the occa&s;ion of her faith in him, and al&s;o the faith of many others: Our Saviour introduces his di&s;|cour&s;e, by a&s;king her to give him to drink. She
<PB N="14" REF="028160_0011_0FD6D82FCB3191F0">
a&s;keth him, why he, being a Jew, a&s;ked drink of her, being a woman of Samaria? Adding, that the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. Je&s;us an&s;wered and &s;aid unto her, if thou knewe&s;t the gift of God, and who it is that &s;aith unto thee, give me to drink, thou woulde&s;t have a&s;ked of him, and the would have given thee living water. Upon the conver&s;ation which followed &s;he was led to con|ceive of him to be a prophet, and makes, to him, the following ob&s;ervation, by way of que&s;tion; our Saviour's an&s;wer to which, is contained in my text.</P>
<P>"Our Fathers, &s;aith &s;he, wor&s;hipped in this moun|tain; and ye &s;ay, that in Jeru&s;alem is the place where men ought to wor&s;hip." The mountain re|ferred to, was an exceeding high mountain, called Gerizim, near Sychem, near to which Jacob had, formerly, made an altar, Gen. xxxiii. 20; and from this mountain Mo&s;es pronounced the ble&s;&s;ings, Deut. xxvii.12. Mention is made, in the book of Nehemiah, that, according to the covenant expre&s;|&s;ed in Ezra x.3, of &s;eparating, from the I&s;raelites, tho&s;e who had married &s;trange wives, one of the &s;ons of Elia&s;hib, the High Prie&s;t, who had married a daughter of Sanballat the Horonite, then Gov|ernor in Samaria, was therefore driven out from the congregation of I&s;rael: But that by Sanballat's in|fluence, he obtained liberty to build a Temple at mount Gerizim; of which he was afterwards High Prie&s;t. To this Temple tho&s;e prie&s;ts, and other I&s;raelites, who had married &s;trange wives, or had been otherwi&s;e criminal, after that, re&s;orted. This Temple, &s;tanding the &s;pace of two hundred and twenty years, was afterwards de&s;troyed. This was the place, where the Samaritans performed
<PB N="15" REF="028160_0012_0FD6D83157D80100">
their religious wor&s;hip, while the Temple was &s;tanding, and al&s;o after it was de&s;troyed; looking upon the ground as holy, they &s;till re&s;orted there for their devotion. With reference to this &s;uper|&s;titious practice, the woman of Samaria &s;aith, "our fathers wor&s;hipped in this mountain." And the Jews held, that none might wor&s;hip God, by &s;acrifice, any where but at Jeru&s;alem, according to the law, Deut. xii. 14, 26. "Je&s;us &s;aith unto her, wo|man believe me, the hour cometh when ye &s;hall, neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jeru&s;alem, wor&s;hip the Father." The import of our Saviour's words may be under&s;tood as follows. Thou owne&s;t me as a prophet, who&s;e office it is to reveal the will of God unto men. It is therefore thy duty to give credit to what I &s;hall reveal to thee, about the true and right way of wor&s;hipping God. The time is coming, yea, nigh at hand, when ye &s;hall, neither in this mountain, Gerizim, where your fa|thers have &s;o long wor&s;hipped God &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly, without any direction from him, nor yet at Jeru&s;a|lem, which is the place he made choice of for his wor&s;hip, wor&s;hip of the Father. God is put|ting an end to both the&s;e places, and to all that wor&s;hip which I &s;hall not in&s;titute, under the go&s;|pel. The hour was coming, when all difference of places, for God's wor&s;hip, &s;hould be taken away; ere long the &s;ervice of God &s;hould not be confined to one place, more than another. "The hour cometh, and now is, when the true wor&s;hippers &s;hall wor&s;hip the Father in &s;pirit and in truth; for the Father &s;eeketh &s;uch to wor&s;hip him." Our Saviour here in&s;tructed her concerning the wor&s;hip it&s;elf; that the ceremonial wor&s;hip, which the
<PB N="16" REF="028160_0013_0FD6D8336B1DA4B8">
Jews and Samaritans had u&s;ed, &s;hould &s;hortly be aboli&s;hed, and in&s;tead thereof, a more &s;piritual form of wor&s;hip &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed; more &s;uitable to the &s;piritual nature of the Deity, and containing in it, the truth and &s;ub&s;tance of all that, which the Jewi&s;h ceremonies prefigured and &s;hadowed forth.</P>
<P>The true wor&s;hip of God, under the go&s;pel, doth not con&s;i&s;t in the external pomp of any out|ward ceremonies. No wor&s;hip is acceptable to him, who is the Father of Spirits, but that which is truly &s;piritual.</P>
<P>From the above comment upon the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of in&s;piration, &s;everal ob&s;ervations are &s;ugge&s;ted, for in&s;truction and improvement.</P>
<P N="1">1. The glorious Deity is the only proper object of all religious wor&s;hip; who&s;e perfections are, un|changeably, the &s;ame, and equally merit the &s;u|preme love and veneration of his wor&s;hippers, in all ages of the church.</P>
<P N="2">2. That manner of wor&s;hip only, is obligatory upon man, and acceptable to the Deity, which he him&s;elf hath in&s;tituted. God's prerogative, wi&s;|dom and goodne&s;s, is manife&s;ted in in&s;tituting and pre&s;cribing the means and manner by which he e&s;|teems him&s;elf glorified, and to which the promi&s;e of his ble&s;&s;ing is annexed. This is equally true, and to be acknowledged, as it re&s;pects tho&s;e laws termed ceremonial, under the Jewi&s;h admini&s;tration, which were temporary, and that wor&s;hip which is more &s;piritual, under the go&s;pel, which is to con|tinue, during the &s;tate of the church militant, here upon earth. And it is a daring affront to the divine Maje&s;ty, to pay religious homage to any creature, or to wor&s;hip God in any other way than he hath appointed. This is offering an in&s;ult to his wi&s;dom.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="17" REF="028160_0014_0FD6D8345563E808">
3. It will be the earne&s;t de&s;ire, and prayer of the true wor&s;hippers of God, that he would ble&s;s his people, in his own appointed way. This is a nat|ural inference from the prayer of Solomon, in my text. "Ari&s;e, O Lord God, into thy re&s;ting place, thou and the Ark of thy &s;trength. Let thy prie&s;ts, O Lord God, be clothed with &s;alvation, and let thy &s;aints rejoice in goodne&s;s." In this prayer of Sol|omon, <HI>&s;aints</HI> are particularly mentioned. Being <HI>clothed with &s;alvation,</HI> may be under&s;tood as a figu|rative expre&s;&s;ion, alluding to tho&s;e prie&s;tly garments, appointed, for beauty and glory, to Aaron and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the prie&s;thood, under the law; point|ing out the ornaments of righteou&s;ne&s;s and true ho|line&s;s; that &s;o their per&s;ons and &s;ervices might be accepted by God, both for them&s;elves and for the peo|ple of God, that they may be encompa&s;&s;ed on every &s;ide, with the divine protection and benediction. And let thy people have cau&s;e, at all times, to rejoice in thy goodne&s;s, imparted to them, in the ways of thine appointment. Such may be under&s;tood to be the language of this prayer of Solomon. The pious de&s;ires of which his prayer is expre&s;&s;ive, will agree with that &s;pirit of benevolence, which the go&s;pel inculcates; and to the apo&s;tolic direction of doing good unto all men, as we have opportunity, e&s;pec|ially to them who are of the hou&s;ehold of faith. Such a temper is &s;trongly recommended by the in|&s;tructions and example of our &s;aviour, who prayed for his cruci&s;iers, &s;aying, "Father forgive them, for they know not what they do." And before his crucifixion, we find him putting up a prayer for his Apo&s;tles in particular, and after that, for all &s;uch
<PB N="18" REF="028160_0015_0FD6D835CD650FD8">
as &s;hould believe on him, through their word.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See John 17.</NOTE> With &s;uch a temper, will corre&s;pond the prayers and de&s;ires of all true wor&s;hippers. They will &s;eek for a ble&s;&s;ing, in God's appointed way, by attend|ing upon in&s;tituted wor&s;hip, in a regular way and man|ner, looking to God, through the Mercy-Seat, that is, through the mediation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the giver of every good and perfect gift: Like new born babes, de&s;iring the &s;incere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby: Seeking it from the prie&s;ts' lips, which are to pre&s;erve knowledge; who are honoured with the title of Chri&s;t's amba&s;|&s;adors, proclaiming the glad tidings of &s;alvation, and publi&s;hing the go&s;pel of peace.</P>
<P>Among the enlargement of privileges, under the go&s;pel, beyond tho&s;e, enjoyed under the Jewi&s;h Di&s;|pen&s;ation, one to be noticed by us is, that the relig|ious difference of places is now taken away, and the wor&s;hip of God not confined to any one particu|lar place or nation. According to the dictates of human wi&s;dom, &s;uch places for religious and &s;ocial wor&s;hip, are now to be preferred, as, on account of local &s;ituation, and comfortable accommodations, afford the greate&s;t convenience for attending, with frequency and regularity: that the public wor&s;hip, in which all are equally intere&s;ted, may be by all enjoyed, with equal conveniency, as far as it can be effected. Both the dictates of rea&s;on and the pre|cepts of the go&s;pel point out this rule, for the gov|ernment of our conduct in appointing places, and erecting convenient buildings for public wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>And I charitably conceive that &s;uch have been the governing motives for the voluntary expen&s;e of erect|ing
<PB N="19" REF="028160_0016_0FD6D837E7684990">
a hou&s;e for public wor&s;hip, in this place. May Chri&s;tian edification, peace, and advancement in ev|ery Chri&s;tian virtue, be the happy fruits and effects both to them and their po&s;terity. In order to which, let every one labour to be of &s;uch a character as the Father &s;eeketh to wor&s;hip him. From &s;piritual principles; with &s;incere love, and filial reverence; for &s;piritual ends, to plea&s;e him, and to promote his glory, with the whole heart, mind, and &s;oul. The Jewi&s;h ceremonial wor&s;hip was aboli&s;hed, to promote the &s;pirituality of divine wor&s;hip. Yet it is not to be under&s;tood, as if God rejected all bodily wor&s;hip, becau&s;e he requires &s;piritual, un|der the go&s;pel. For Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the mo&s;t &s;pirit|ual wor&s;hipper, wor&s;hipped God with his body. God has appointed &s;ome parts of wor&s;hip, which cannot be performed without the body; &s;uch as &s;acraments. In a word, God has created the body as well as the &s;oul; and Chri&s;t has redeemed the body as well as the &s;oul; therefore it is our duty, to wor&s;hip and glorify God, with our body and &s;pirit which are his.</P>
<P>May we all be led to greater advancement in the knowledge of God, and our duty, and to wor&s;hip him, in a more acceptable manner; be formed into a nearer re&s;emblance of his moral character; expe|rience an increa&s;e of love and veneration towards him, and become qualified for the full enjoyment of him, in the man&s;ions of eternal glory. Let us all, in our approaches to God in the way of wor&s;hip, dive&s;t our&s;elves of all unworthy thoughts and ap|prehen&s;ions of the Deity, as con&s;i&s;ting of any cor|poreal parts, or any &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions or affections as in|dicate change or imperfection; and con&s;ider him as a pure, intelligent &s;pirit, whom the heaven of heav|ens
<PB N="20" REF="028160_0017_0FD6D838C8A8B490">
cannot contain, who is ever pre&s;ent with us, and &s;earcheth the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of our hearts, who cannot be deceived, and who will not be mocked; who, though perfectly independent of any of our &s;ervices, yet is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to view with ap|approbation the devout wor&s;hipper, who wor&s;hippeth him in &s;pirit and in truth; but views with di&s;ap|probation and abhorrence, the fal&s;e adulation of the hypocrite. "He that offereth prai&s;e, glorifieth me, &s;aith the Lord, by the mouth of the P&s;almi&s;t, and to him that ordereth his conver&s;ation aright, will I &s;hew the &s;alvation of God." Let us in all acts of religious exerci&s;e, con&s;ider with whom it is we have to do&mdash;an infinitely holy God. And as we are con&s;cious in our&s;elves, of being &s;inful and guilty, and thereby unworthy the pre&s;ence of an holy God, let us approach him, in the worthy name of Chri&s;t, the only mediator, with adoring apprehen&s;ions of the divine goodne&s;s, in the gift of his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t; in who&s;e name we are encouraged to come, with boldne&s;s, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in every time of need. Ample encou|ragement is given to the devout wor&s;hipper of ob|taining grace here, and glory hereafter. Let his &s;aints therefore rejoice in goodne&s;s. May we, each one, have our hearts filled with gratitude, and our tongues with prai&s;e; and with &s;incerity of heart, may we &s;ay, with the P&s;almi&s;t, "I was glad when they &s;aid unto me, we will go into the hou&s;e of the Lord: Our feet &s;ahll &s;tand within thy gates, O Je|ru&s;alem."</P>
<P>May <HI>this hou&s;e,</HI> devoted to religious wor&s;hip, be always approached with joy and gladne&s;s, and with proper &s;olemnity, remembering that <HI>this is none
<PB N="21" REF="028160_0018_0FD6D83C07134F50">
other than the hou&s;e of God, and the gate of heaven.</HI> Let every unhallowed thought, word, and action be &s;trictly guarded again&s;t and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed remembering that holine&s;s becomes God's hou&s;e forever. The glorious Deity, the proper object of all religious wor&s;hip, is pre&s;ent in wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;emblies, to notice with what hearts his people approach him; and will command his ble&s;&s;ing upon the devout wor|&s;hipper who wor&s;hippeth him in &s;pirit and in truth, even life forevermore. If you thus &s;eek and &s;erve the Lord, he will be found of you; but if you for|&s;ake him, he will ca&s;t you off forever.</P>
<P>When Solomon had ended his prayer, at the con|&s;ecration of the temple, the Lord appeared to him, by night, and &s;aid unto him, I have heard thy pray|er and have cho&s;en this place to my&s;elf, for an hou&s;e of &s;acrifice. And God graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed, that upon their &s;eeking and &s;erving him, in a right man|ner, he would hear the prayers which &s;hould be made in that hou&s;e, and judgments &s;hould be re|moved. "If my people which are called by my name, &s;hall humble them&s;elves, and pray, and &s;eek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their &s;ins, and will heal their land. But if ye turn away and for&s;ake my &s;tatues, &amp;c, then will I pluck them up, and this hou&s;e &s;hall be a proverb, and a by-word among all nations."</P>
<P>May we not then, my hearers, with tran&s;ports of joy, anticipate the ble&s;&s;ings which may be derived from the Father of mercies, to the true wor&s;hippers, in this hou&s;e of the pre&s;ent and future generations? For which end, may the wor&s;hip of God ever be duly performed, and attended to, in it: Peace and
<PB N="22" REF="028160_0019_0FD6D83F30E74598">
concord be ever promoted and cultivated in every heart, and the religion of the Redeemer here flouri&s;h. Then may the ble&s;&s;ing be experienced as expre&s;&s;ed, in P&s;alm 133rd, "I will abundantly ble&s;s her pro|vi&s;ion; I will fill her poor with bread: I will al&s;o clothe her prie&s;ts with &s;alvation and her &s;aints &s;hall &s;hout aloud for joy."</P>
<P>By way of conclu&s;ion. As we have begun the year this day, with religious exerci&s;e, may we, each one, per&s;erve in religious virtue: that &s;o it may prove, indeed, a happy year to each of us. For which end, let us unite in our petitions at the throne of grace, in the language of Solomon, in my text..</P>
<P>"Now therefore ari&s;e, O Lord God, into thy re&s;ting place, thou, and the Ark of thy &s;trength; Let thy prie&s;ts, O Lord God, be clothed with &s;al|vation, and let thy &s;aints rejoice in goodne&s;s."</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM xxvi. 8.</BIBL>
<Q>"<HI>Lord I have loved the habitation of thy hou&s;e, and the place where thine honour dwells.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE P&s;almi&s;t, in this p&s;alm, is pleading his integrity before God, and &s;trengthen|ing his heart with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his upright endeavours to walk in the way of piety and righ|teou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>He appeals to the Searcher of hearts, for the &s;in|cerity of his affection towards him, and de&s;ire to plea&s;e him. "Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart; for thy loving kindne&s;s is before mine eyes, and I have walked in thy truth." He proceeds to declare that he had made u&s;e of prudence and caution, to pre&s;erve him|&s;elf pure, and keep him&s;elf out of the way of tempta|tion, in avoiding intimacy with tho&s;e, who&s;e ex|ample might be en&s;naring. "I have not &s;at with
<PB N="4" REF="028160_0022_0FD6D84B41BBAA20">
vain per&s;ons, neither will I go in with di&s;&s;emblers; I have hated the congregation of evil doers, and will not &s;it with the wicked." The duties of pie|ty and devotion he con&s;idered as an important part of the &s;ervice due from a man to his Maker, without attention to which the human character mu&s;t be e&s;&s;en|tially defective. He was &s;en&s;ible on the other hand, that devotion without purity and moral virtue, could never be acceptable to a holy God; and that an outward compliance with the duties of religion, without the homage and affection of the heart, is but like a body without a &s;oul, a &s;hadow without the &s;ub&s;tance. The&s;e ideas appear to be &s;ugge&s;ted by the following expre&s;&s;ions. "I will wa&s;h my hands in innocency, &s;o will I compo&s;s thine altar, O Lord; that I may publi&s;h with the voice of thank&s;giving, and tell of all thy wondrous works. <HI>I have loved the habitation of thy hou&s;e, and the place where thine hon|our dwells.</HI> The meaning and rea&s;on of the ex|pre&s;&s;ions made u&s;e of in the text, may be explained by the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The <HI>hou&s;e of the Lord,</HI> to which the p&s;almi&s;t re|fers, mu&s;t be the Tabernacle, erected originally ac|cording to the particular directions of God him&s;elf, in the wilderne&s;s, but rebuilt, as it &s;eems, by David, in the city of Jeru&s;alem, after the Ark of the Con|venant, which had been taken by the Phili&s;tines, was returned, and with &s;olemn pomp placed in that city. For we read that "they brought in the Ark of the Lord, and &s;et it in his place, in the mid&s;t of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Samuel vi.17.</NOTE> This was called <HI>the habitation of God's hou&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e it
<PB N="5" REF="028160_0023_0FD6D84C47BD9CF8">
was erected for his wor&s;hip, and becau&s;e it was the place where the cho&s;en people were taught to ex|pect his peculiar pre&s;ence; the place where he gra|ciou&s;ly vouch&s;afed to dwell. Thus it is &s;aid, "The Lord hath cho&s;en Zion; he hath de&s;ired it for his habitation: This is my re&s;t forever; here will I dwell."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxxxii. 13, 14.</NOTE> And again, "In Salem al&s;o is his Taber|nacle, and his dwelling place in Zion."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lxxvi. 2.</NOTE> Accord|ingly the P&s;almi&s;t further de&s;cribes the Tabernacle, or the hou&s;e of the Lord, by the following words in the text, <HI>the place where his honour dwells.</HI> It was there that the Lord occa&s;ionally manife&s;ted, in a vi&s;ible manner, his glory; and thence he regularly gave forth his oracles. It was before the Ark that the prie&s;ts were to inquire the mind of the Lord, and receive their directions from him. As God was in a peculiar &s;en&s;e the <HI>King</HI> of the Jews: As he was their immediate Sovereign; &s;o the Taber|nacle was con&s;idered as his <HI>Palace,</HI> the place of his &s;tated re&s;idence, and the Mercy-Seat as his <HI>Throne.</HI> Therefore he is &s;aid to <HI>dwell between the Cherubims.</HI> But as he was their God, as well as their king, &s;o the Tabernacle was a Temple as well as a Palace, and here the people offered their wor&s;hip to him, as well as received their orders and directions from him. And it is in this latter view e&s;pecially, that hou&s;es now dedicated to the &s;ervice of God, re&s;emble the Tabernacle or Temple of old.</P>
<P>The example of David in his affection for God's hou&s;e, is mo&s;t worthy our imitation. Let us now con&s;ider,

<ITEM>I. What his example implies.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The obligation which lies upon us to im|itate it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. When we &s;peak of his example as applicable to our&s;elves; loving the habitation of God's hou&s;e, is loving the public wor&s;hip of God, wherever it may be performed. His wor&s;hip is not now confined to a particular hou&s;e, or a &s;ingle city; but wherever &s;incere wor&s;hippers a&s;&s;emble, there is a hou&s;e for God. This is the nature and genius of the di&s;pen&s;ation under which we live; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to what our Lord &s;aid to the Samaritan woman: "The hour cometh, when ye &s;hall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jeru&s;alem, wor&s;hip the Fa|ther." The period in which a le&s;s confined, and more &s;piritual wor&s;hip was to take place. For he proceeds to &s;ay, by way of explanation: The hour cometh, and now is, when the true wor&s;hippers &s;hall wor&s;hip the Father in &s;pirit and in truth."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iv.21 and 23.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is true however, in the Chri&s;tian world, as well as among the Jews, that wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;em|blies are ordinarily held in hou&s;es erected for the purpo&s;e; and which, though not entirely confined to this u&s;e, are &s;o much devoted to it, that it may, with|out impropriety or &s;uper&s;tition be &s;aid, that they are dedicated to God.</P>
<P>The Temples of the Heathens, as well as the Temple of the Jews at Jeru&s;alem, were magnificent, co&s;tly buildings: And they were held in a kind and degree of veneration, which is not common, and which we do not &s;ay would be proper, among Chri&s;tians. Chri&s;tians indeed are far from being all alike in this re&s;pect. Churches in &s;ome parts
<PB N="7" REF="028160_0025_0FD6D85854B22FF0">
of Chri&s;tendom, are built and ornamented with a profu&s;ion of expen&s;e, which humanity might well wi&s;h had been be&s;towed, in part at lea&s;t, for &s;upply|ing the wants of the poor, and alleviating the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of the mi&s;erable. They have owed much of their magnificence to &s;uper&s;tition; yet &s;till I may &s;ay, they have owed not a little of it to a natural and rational veneration of the Deity, wor&s;hipped therein. If it be an error to be&s;tow great labour and expen&s;e on buildings dedicated to God, it &s;eems to be an er|ror not unnatural or unpardonable. The mind will not readily oppo&s;e, or attempt to confu&s;e &s;uch rea|&s;oning as follows. Should not mankind &s;erve and honour the Deity with their be&s;t? Should not ev|ery thing be great and noble, or excellent in its kind, that is dedicated to the &s;ervice of the greate&s;t and be&s;t of beings, the INFINITE MAJESTY OF HEAV|EN? What building &s;hould be more firm and durable, than that which is erected to the honour of the ETERNAL GOD? Or what can the labours of the mo&s;t ingenious arti&s;ts; the highe&s;t efforts of hu|man &s;kill, be more worthily be&s;towed, than on the Temples of the SUPREME ARCHITECT, who is wonderful in coun&s;el, and excellent in working? Why the beauty and elegance of hou&s;es dedicated to the wor&s;hip of God, &s;hould not keep pace with the increa&s;e of wealth and refinement among a peo|ple, and their ability to improve and ornament their own hou&s;es, perhaps no good rea&s;on, can be given. This at lea&s;t may be &s;aid, that rea&s;on, if not religion, teaches us to render hou&s;es for religious a&s;&s;embling, commodious and comfortable. To &s;pare the pains and expen&s;e nece&s;&s;ary for this, would betray a want of due regard to our&s;elves, our own
<PB N="8" REF="028160_0026_0FD6D85B4CA60D68">
ca&s;e, health, and convenience, or an unbecoming in|differenceas to the public wor&s;hip of God; and &s;hew, ei|ther, that we were willing to be needle&s;ly incommo|ded in God's hou&s;e, or be furni&s;hed with an excu&s;e for ab&s;enting our&s;elves from it.</P>
<P>But to return. To love the habitation of God's hou&s;e, you will readily conceive is not merely or principally to take delight in, or &s;et our hearts upon the <HI>building</HI> it&s;elf, however commodious or elegant, but to love the wor&s;hip which is performed there. It is to take plea&s;ure in drawing near to God in a public, &s;ocial manner, and coming before him <HI>as his people come.</HI> It mu&s;t herefore imply an uniform de&s;ire and endeavour to be pre&s;ent at, and join in the &s;olemnities of public wor&s;hip. They who love the habitation of God's hou&s;e, may be &s;o circum|&s;tanced that they cannot frequently join the a&s;&s;em|bly of his people therein: But they who can, and yet do not, ever, or but very &s;eldom, attend, can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed to have that affection for his hou&s;e and wor&s;hip, which the P&s;almi&s;t expre&s;&s;ed. If men's hearts be there, they will endeavour to be there al&s;o. Providence may often di&s;appoint their wi&s;hes; but if they &s;eek excu&s;es for ab&s;enting them|&s;elves, or are &s;atisfied with &s;uch as are very trifling, there is too much rea&s;on to fear that their hearts are not right, and that they are either indifferent to, or aver&s;e from the public wor&s;hip of God.</P>
<P>It is true, that per&s;ons may attend, and love, or be attached to, the wor&s;hip of God's hou&s;e for rea|&s;ons that have nothing to do with religion. It may therefore be ob&s;erved that the love which the P&s;alm|i&s;t's example recommends, is founded on pure and worthy principles. The good man does not love God's hou&s;e, or attend his wor&s;hip therein, merely
<PB N="9" REF="028160_0027_0FD6D85DAFAB5E80">
becau&s;e he is accu&s;tomed to &s;uch attendance, though this may be the means of &s;trengthening his attach|ment to it. He attends, not becau&s;e it is reputable, and exhibits a good example; though I do not &s;ay it would be be&s;t for a man to ab&s;ent him&s;elf, if he had no higher views than the&s;e, &s;ince, to &s;ay noth|ing of the po&s;&s;ibility of his being per&s;onally benefit|ed by the appointed means of grace, his attendance might be beneficial to others: Not that he may have an opportunity for tran&s;acting worldly bu&s;ine&s;s with his neighbours; for this is by no means the de&s;ign of our meeting together: Not that he may have agreeable exerci&s;e on the day of re&s;t, or avoid the tediou&s;ne&s;s of confinement at home; though it reflects honour on the divine in&s;titutions, and illu&s;|trates their wi&s;dom and benevolence, to ob&s;erve, that one part of the duty of the Lord's day has a tendency to render the others more agreeable. But he loves, and vi&s;its, when in his power, the hou&s;e of God, becau&s;e he conceives that there <HI>men ought to wor&s;hip,</HI> that a&s;&s;embling for &s;ocial wor&s;hip is a very important part of the duty of the Lord's day; and the giving of opportunity for it, a very di&s;tin|gui&s;hed end in &s;eparating, and hallowing the day. He con&s;cientiou&s;ly attends, becau&s;e he con&s;iders it as an appointed and valuable means of moral and religious improvement, and hopes to be benefited, and contribute to the benefit of others, by joining them in doing homage to their common Lord, prai&s;ing their common Benefactor, &s;eeking to in|crea&s;e their religious knowledge, and in having their various duties explained to them, or inculcated upon them.</P>

2. That he thinks ju&s;tly: That attending pub|lic wor&s;hip is a duty incumbent on Chri&s;tians; or that we are under obligation to imitate the P&s;alm|i&s;t's example, we &s;hall have no rea&s;on to doubt if we du|ly con&s;ider the de&s;ign of the in&s;titution, the advan|tages of it, or what the &s;criptures teach us relative to this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It is an almo&s;t undi&s;puted dictate of rea&s;on that we ought to wor&s;hip God: That we &s;hould ac|knowledge our dependence upon him; thank him for his favours; commit our&s;elves to his protection, and &s;eek his favour and ble&s;&s;ing. The external wor&s;hip of him is no more than expre&s;&s;ing and act|ing out, tho&s;e &s;entiments of fear, love, reverence, gratitude, confidence, and hope, which are mani|fe&s;tly fit in beings, related to him, and dependent upon him as we are. As we are &s;ocial beings, &s;o|cial or united acknowledgements are properly offer|ed to him. We have common and public ble&s;&s;ings to be thankful for, as well as common wants to be &s;upplied; and therefore it &s;eems right and becom|ing that we &s;hould give thanks, and offer up our petitions, in a public, as well as in a private man|ner. Be&s;ides, in the former way only can we &s;o clearly manife&s;t to others, our regard and reverence for the Deity. In this way he is more highly hon|oured as the Almighty Sovereign, Lord of heaven and earth. We mo&s;t effectually do him homage, and &s;hew forth his glory, when we prai&s;e him <HI>in the great congregation,</HI> and in the &s;anctuary, <HI>talk of all his wondrous works.</HI></P>
<P>But the propriety of public religious a&s;&s;emblies, and our obligation to attend them, will further ap|pear, if we con&s;ider that the de&s;ign of them is, not
<PB N="11" REF="028160_0029_0FD6D865C15C6380">
merely that we may pray and prai&s;e, but that we may hear the truth of God's word; may be in|&s;tructed and exhorted, and by preaching have our minds enlightened or quickened in the knowledge of divine things. The importance and advantage of the public &s;tated teaching of religion and moral|ity will hardly be denied by any &s;erious, con&s;ider|ate per&s;on; by any who attend to them&s;elves, or to the &s;tate of the world around them. The manife&s;t utility of &s;uch an in&s;titution, would afford a rati|onal inducement to all tho&s;e who wi&s;h well to the intere&s;ts of mankind, cheerfully to comply with it, were it only of human origin. But its ori|gin is divine. Revelation confirms our rea&s;oning on this &s;ubject; and in the &s;criptures we may clear|ly read our obligation to frequent and love the hab|itation of God's hou&s;e, and the place where his hon|our dwells. Although we are not bound to obey the directions and commands given to the Jews, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> and which were of an appropriate or local nature, yet from its being enjoined on them by God, to wor&s;hip him in a &s;ocial, public manner, and the form of their wor&s;hip being &s;o particularly pre&s;cribed, we may at lea&s;t ju&s;tly infer that public wor&s;hip is fit and proper in it&s;elf, and agreeable to the will of the Deity; for el&s;e he would never have enjoined it, in any form, upon any people. Nor can it be truly &s;aid that we have no warrant for it in the New Te&s;tament, and under the Chri&s;tian Di&s;|pen&s;ation. Our Saviour frequented the &s;ynagogues, and thus gave his countenance to that kind of wor|&s;hip, before his own kingdom was &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed as to &s;uper&s;ede or aboli&s;h it. He prayed with his own di&s;ciples: He preached him&s;elf: He &s;ent them out
<PB N="12" REF="028160_0030_0FD6D8674F5C1160">
to preach: And he &s;aid, "where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the mid&s;t of them."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xviii. 20.</NOTE> We find that the di&s;ciples, after Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion, wor&s;hipped together: That they "all continued, with one accord, in prayer and &s;up|plication:"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts i. 14.</NOTE> That "they continued &s;teadfa&s;tly in the apo&s;tle's doctrine and fellow&s;hip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 42.</NOTE> We find al&s;o that when the number of the di&s;ciples was increa&s;ed, and the go&s;pel &s;pread into various regions, particular &s;o|cieties were formed in different places, for the con|venience of a&s;&s;embling and performing the &s;everal acts of Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip and communion. The&s;e were &s;tiled Churches, and had Elders ordained in them re&s;pectively. That it was the practice, in tho&s;e early times, for Chri&s;tians to meet together, for re|ligious purpo&s;es, at leas&s;t on the fir&s;t day of the week, or Lord's day, we are taught by the two following expre&s;&s;ions made u&s;e of by the apo&s;tle, taken in connexion with the pa&s;&s;ages afterwards mentioned. "If therefore the whole church be come together in one place;"<NOTE N="&punc;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiv. 23.</NOTE> and "when ye come together in the church."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">ii. 18.</NOTE> We read of the collection for the poor being made on the fir&s;t day of the week, which is ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed to imply the a&s;&s;embling of the church on that day.<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">See xvi. 1, 2.</NOTE> More expre&s;sly, we read of the di&s;|ciples <HI>coming together on the fir&s;t day of the week, to break bread,</HI> as of &s;omething well known and cu&s;|tomary, and of Paul's preaching among them on the occa&s;ion.<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Acts xx. 7.</NOTE> And finally, that this meeting to|gether for public wor&s;hip, was con&s;idered as a mat|ter
<PB N="13" REF="028160_0031_0FD6D868C795E118">
of great importance, and not lightly to be di&s;|pen&s;ed with, we are taught by the exhortation given to Chri&s;tians, <HI>not to for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling of them&s;elves together, as the manner of &s;ome was.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 27.</NOTE> From the connexion in which this caution or ex|hortation &s;tands, we are led to conclude that thus for&s;aking the public a&s;&s;emblies was viewed as a virtual giving up their profe&s;&s;ion, and apo&s;tatizing from the faith. This doubtle&s;s we may &s;et down for a truth, that to the in&s;titution of public religious a&s;&s;emblies, and its having been generally complied with in the Chri&s;tian world, the pre&s;ervation of Chri&s;tianity to the pre&s;ent day is, under God, to be e&s;pecially attributed.</P>
<P>General inferences from, and reflections upon what has been &s;aid, mu&s;t give place to &s;uch occa|&s;ional ob&s;ervations as have an a&s;pect on the rea&s;on and circum&s;tances of our pre&s;ent a&s;&s;embling.</P>
<P>It is with a view e&s;pecially to the convenience of meeting together for public wor&s;hip, not only that particular churches con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch as inhabit the &s;ame vicinity, but that the civil divi&s;ions into towns and pari&s;hes have been e&s;tabli&s;hed among us. In forming and proportioning the latter more particu|larly, it has been an object to have them contain no more people than might conveniently a&s;&s;emble at the &s;ame hou&s;e. As the inhabitants of our country have become more numerous, new towns and par|i&s;hes have been erected, and old ones divided, as the increa&s;ed numbers and ability of the people, or oth|er changes in their &s;ituation, have dictated. And &s;ometimes, even before the population and wealth of a pari&s;h is judged adequate to the con&s;tant &s;upport of two wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;emblies, and two public

teachers of religion, the local circum&s;tances of a large portion of the &s;ociety may be &s;uch, as to ren|der an imperfect divi&s;ion expedient. Such circum|&s;tances have prompted to the building of <HI>this hou&s;e,</HI> in which for the fir&s;t time, a wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;em|bly is held this day.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A con&s;iderable part of the inhabitants of Yarmouth, not far from one third, live near the fourth &s;hore of the town, at the di&s;tance of four miles and upwards from the meeting hou&s;e, on the north &s;ide, where they have hitherto attended public wor&s;hip. By their &s;ucce&s;s in the fi&s;hery, which is flouri&s;hing and increa&s;ing among them, they have been enabled and encou|raged to each the hou&s;e referred to; in which it is their expectation, in con&s;equence of previous arrangements made, that the pre&s;ent mini&s;ter of the town, will preach a certain proportion of the time, to be agreed upon by the inhabitants at large.</NOTE> We hope and tru&s;t that they for who&s;e benefit it is more e&s;pecially intended, have been actuated in building it by a &s;incere regard to the honour of that God, to who&s;e &s;ervice it is now dedicated. Is it not becau&s;e they <HI>have loved the habitation of God's hou&s;e, and the place where his hon|our dwells;</HI> becau&s;e they wi&s;h to have it in their power more frequently to tread his courts, than oth|erwi&s;e they could, that this commodious edifice now &s;tands, thus far complete, in the mid&s;t of them|&s;elves? We know not of any rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that party views, or any unbecoming &s;pirit, have operated to produce what we &s;ee this day. We do not con&s;ider it as &s;etting up altar again&s;t altar, but as a peaceable and well meant attempt more fully to accommodate one and the &s;ame religious &s;ociety: de&s;irous to continue the &s;ame, unle&s;s Providence &s;hould in &s;ome future time, point out the propriety of a complete &s;eparation, and forming two di&s;tinct wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>We congratulate you on the pro&s;pect which is now pre&s;ented, of your being able more generally
<PB N="15" REF="028160_0033_0FD6D8764A169888">
and conveniently, with your families and your little ones, to appear before the Lord in his hou&s;e of prayer. And if your pa&s;tor, with a view to your convenience and greater edification, is willing to be in labours more abundant than he had rea&s;on origi|nally to expect, mu&s;t not his people e&s;teem him more highly in love, for his work's &s;ake, and cheer|fully mini&s;ter to his &s;upport and comfort, as rea&s;on and equity &s;hall dictate?</P>
<P>And now, brethren, &s;uffer the word of exhorta|tion. Take heed unto your&s;elves, as well as duly regard him who is over you in the Lord. For&s;ake not the a&s;&s;embling of your&s;elves together. Expo&s;e not your&s;elves to the imputation of undervaluing an important privilege, becau&s;e the enjoyment of it may be procured with le&s;s difficulty and exertion than heretofore. Be thankful unto him who <HI>giv|eth the power to get wealth,</HI> that, by pro&s;pering your in that bu&s;ine&s;s which &s;eems to be a&s;&s;igned to you by Providence, he is enabling you, with greater ca&s;e and convenience, to enjoy the benefit of public wor|&s;hip for your&s;elves and your families. It is to your honour that your have been di&s;po&s;ed to dedi|cate to the &s;ervice of your heavenly Benefactor, &s;uch a portion of the fruits of your increa&s;e. But forget not the indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation you are under to <HI>give your own&s;elves al&s;o unto the Lord.</HI> The pure and holy heart is the temple in which he e&s;pecially delights to dwell. Let your neal for the wor&s;hip of God, be rendered acceptable to him by your &s;in|cere and a&s;&s;iduous obedience unto all his commands. Let ju&s;tice and charity, &s;obriety and temperance, be firmly united with piety in your characters. And while you exerci&s;e chri&s;tian candour towards tho&s;e who differ from you in &s;ome of their religious &s;en|timents
<PB N="16" REF="028160_0034_0FD6D878015EDC50">
and modes, labour to convince them by your conduct, that true religion is not confined to any particular &s;ect of Chri&s;tians; at lea&s;t that it has, in reality, imparted of its &s;pirit unto <HI>you.</HI> Permit me to add a &s;ervent, wi&s;h, that Chri&s;tians of every de|nomination among us, would, in their feelings and conduct towards each other, conform to the &s;pirit of their common religion, and imitate the liberality of the con&s;titution under which they live: And as this <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hes</HI> no particular form of Chri&s;tianity, but views all per&s;ua&s;ions conducting peaceably and in|offen&s;ively, with an equal eye, &s;o their mutual com|petitions for &s;uperiority and pre-eminence, might con&s;i&s;t only in &s;triving to excel the re&s;t in the knowl|edge of truth, and the practice of virtue and good|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The leading object of the di&s;cour&s;e which you have heard, (I now addre&s;s my&s;elf to this whole a&s;&s;embly,) has been, to recommend an affectionate and rationally zealous regard to the wor&s;hip of God's hou&s;e. And let us all take heed, that nei|ther the &s;coffs of the infidel, the example of the profane and wicked, nor our own indolence or worldline&s;s, or the employment and mode of life in which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, any of us, be engaged, le&s;&s;en our re&s;pect for the divine in&s;titutions; tempt us to pro|fane the Lord's Day, or render us indifferent to the wor&s;hip of the Sanctuary. But let us not forget, that the &s;tricte&s;t attendance on the public wor&s;hip of God, and the mo&s;t &s;crupulous ob&s;ervance even of all the external parts of religion, will not alone for the neglect of tho&s;e virtues which are &s;tyled, by our Lord him&s;elf, <HI>the weightier matters of the law;</HI> will not avail us without a vital principle of relig|ion and goodne&s;s in our hearts, which &s;hall manife&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="028160_0035_0FD6D88322584450">
it&s;elf in a holy life and conver&s;ation. If while we apparently delight to draw nigh unto God in the ways of his appointment, we really di&s;regard his authority, and ca&s;t his laws behind us, we may well expect that he will turn away, with abhorrence, from our hypocritical oblations, and, &s;everely re|mon&s;trating, &s;ay unto us, as to the perver&s;e and wicked among his people of old, "What ha&s;t thou to do to declare my &s;tatutes, or that thou &s;houlde&s;t take my covenant into thy mouth?" Let all be per|&s;uaded &s;eriou&s;ly to recollect and con&s;ider how they have received and heard, hold fa&s;t that which is good, and repent of all their pa&s;t mi&s;improvement of the privileges which they have enjoyed.</P>
<P>To &s;uch &s;elf-examination, &s;hould we not be led, not only by the <HI>occa&s;ion,</HI> but by the <HI>time</HI> of our pre&s;|ent a&s;&s;embling? Through the goodne&s;s of our al|mighty Pre&s;erver and Benefactor, we are brought to the beginning of another <HI>year;</HI> a divi&s;ion of time which bears no incon&s;iderable proportion to the life of man, when protracted to its greate&s;t length; and which includes the whole earthly exi&s;tence of great multitudes that are born into the world. Tho&s;e congratulations, and wi&s;hes for each other's happi|ne&s;s, which mark this <HI>fir&s;t day</HI> of the year, are not more common, than they are natural. But is it le&s;s natural or proper to di&s;tingui&s;h this day, by offering the tribute of heart-felt gratitude to him who is the length of our days, the health of our counte|nance, and the author of all our mercies? Ought it not al&s;o to be a day of &s;olemn recollection? While we pau&s;e to con&s;ider how many of the years, commonly allotted to man, are, with re&s;pect to us, pa&s;&s;ed and gone, &s;hall we not at the &s;ame time inquire in what manner they have pa&s;&s;ed, and how far they
<PB N="18" REF="028160_0036_0FD6D8856C37E2A0">
have been improved to moral and religious pur|po&s;es, or in forwarding the great and all-important and of our exi&s;tence? While we erect our monu|ment of gratitude, and &s;ay "hitherto the Lord hath helped us," &s;hall we not be aba&s;ed before him on account of our former neglect, our follies and vices; and filled with &s;hame and regret that &s;o much of our lives has been &s;pent in vain, or wor&s;e than in vain, hum|bly, yet &s;tead fa&s;tly re&s;olve that, for the time to come, we will conduct our&s;elves in a manner more becoming our profe&s;&s;ions, our obligations, and our hopes?</P>
<P>By delaying to &s;ecure the favour and friend&s;hip of the Supreme, we ri&s;k the lo&s;s of every thing, that, comparatively &s;peaking, de&s;erves our care, af|fection, or pur&s;uit. We know not what a day, much le&s;s what a year, may bring forth. The pre&s;ent time is all that we can ju&s;tly call our own. To-day, therefore, while it is called to-day, let us all attend to the things of our everla&s;ting peace. From hence|forth let us labour to glorify God, in body and in &s;pirit, which are his; and by practically loving him, as well as his hou&s;e, and &s;acredly regarding his will, at all times, and in all places, earne&s;tly and with per&s;erverance, &s;eek preparation for, and a final in|troduction to THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND CHURCH OF THE FIRST-BORN, WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN HEAVEN.</P>
