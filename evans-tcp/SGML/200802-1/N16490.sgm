<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE different inclinations, employ|ments, and amu&s;ements which engage the attention of boys and girls, &s;ugge&s;ted to the Author of the following trifling performance, that &s;uch a de&s;ign might not be u&s;ele&s;s to fill up tho&s;e intervals of lei&s;ure, which may occur to the former from their more important &s;tudies. With this view therefore, it is now &s;ubmitted to the candour of publick in&s;pection, tru&s;t|ing for a favourable reception, more to the utility of the plan than the merit of its execution. The indulgent attention with which the Adventures of a Pincu&s;h|ion has been honoured, flattered the writer with an opinion, that a work like the pre&s;ent might meet with equal &s;ucce&s;s; as the aim in both has been to promote the cau&s;e of</HI> virtue, <HI>and to blend the hints of in&s;truction with incidents of an a|mu&s;ing
<PB N="8" REF="021188_0004_0FB29E96D915D830">
nature. The former work was de&s;igned chiefly for the u&s;e of young La|dies, this is evidently calculated for young Gentlemen: For although the laws of ju&s;tice, probity and truth, are of</HI> gen|eral <HI>obligation, yet it was imagined, that by con&s;ulting</HI> different amu&s;ements <HI>and</HI> pur&s;uits, <HI>and recommending the accom|pli&s;hments</HI> &s;eparately, <HI>in which each &s;ex were more particularly concerned, the &s;ubjects would become more intere&s;ting to tho&s;e readers to whom they were im|mediately addre&s;&s;ed, and have, in con&s;e|quence, a better chance for approbation.</HI></P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF A PEGTOP.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have heard that a <HI>Pincu&s;hion,</HI> a <HI>Dog,</HI> a <HI>Halfpenny,</HI> and a <HI>Bank Note</HI> have each written a hi&s;tory of their adventures, I thought to my&s;elf one morning, when I was left upon a writing de&s;k, that it would be a convenient opportunity for me to immitate &s;uch examples, and that the memoirs of a <HI>Pegtop</HI> might prove equally entertaining with any of the be|forementioned hi&s;tories. So re&s;olving to re|collect the various &s;cenes I had pa&s;&s;ed through, I determined to pre&s;ent <HI>my adventures</HI> likewi&s;e to the world, and &s;hare in the fame of tho&s;e Authors, who had be&s;towed their labours to immortalize a particular animal or toy, while the re&s;t of their &s;pecies were con&s;igned to neg|lect or oblivion.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="021188_0006_0FB29E9A1DB71610">
I was completed, gentle reader, into my pre&s;ent form on a <HI>Friday</HI> morning, and &s;urvey|ed with great &s;atisfaction by the workman who had accompli&s;hed me, as the be&s;t top he had ever produced. In the afternoon of the &s;ame day he carried me, with a number of my brethren, to a large toy &s;hop in <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> where I was pre&s;ented to the ma&s;ter; and after be|ing examined, and having received great com|mendation from the mechanick who brought me thither, was to&s;&s;ed, with very little ceremony into a large drawer with the companions who had accompanied me, and &s;ome whom I never before &s;aw. As we were all <HI>new,</HI> and had not as yet &s;een any thing beyond our pre&s;ent abode, and the bag in which we were convey|ed to it, we remained extremely &s;ilent and re|&s;erved; for you mu&s;t allow me the privilege of &s;uppo&s;ing, I can make known my &s;entiments to other inanimate &s;ub&s;tances, though I have not the powers of articulation; as in effect if you can imagine a top to be capable of <HI>writing</HI> and <HI>compo&s;ition,</HI> there will remain little difficulty in granting to it the licence of &s;peech; all
<PB N="11" REF="021188_0007_0FB29E9B4AC63978">
the&s;e talents being entirely incon&s;i&s;tent with truth and reality, but may be allowed to exi&s;t by the force of imagination. Thus far having premi&s;ed, as a nece&s;&s;ary preliminary to my hi&s;|tory, I &s;hall continue to inform you, that we had very little conver&s;ation with each other. A few indeed wi&s;hed to make their e&s;cape from this place of confinement; and a poor top who had a piece broken off from one of its &s;ides, very pathetically lamented, that it had &s;een three drawers full di&s;po&s;ed of, while it had lain al|ways neglected on this account, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had been rolled out on the counter, and taken up as of|ten as any purcha&s;er appeared; and although offered to &s;ale for <HI>half</HI> the price of its compan|ions, had been to&s;&s;ed back with contempt, and was likely to remain in that &s;ituation for|ever. I felt a great degree of &s;ympathy for this unfortunate brother, and was ju&s;t going to expre&s;s my pity for his condition, when the drawer which contained us, was &s;uddenly pull|ed out, and a very genteel lady &s;elected &s;ome of us to pre&s;ent to a little boy in &s;carlet clothes,
<PB N="12" REF="021188_0008_0FB29E9CC13B27B0">
who appeared to be about ten years old. The youth, however, de&s;ired leave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> chu&s;e for him&s;elf, telling the lady, whom he called
<FIGURE>

mamma, that &s;he did not under&s;tand which would be a good <HI>&s;pinner:</HI> after handling almo&s;t all that he &s;aw, he &s;elected <HI>me</HI> as the be&s;t of the whole collection. The lady paid the price which was a&s;ked for me, and I was put into ma&s;ter's pocket, who walked off, not a little plea&s;ed with his purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>When we reached the hou&s;e he was going to which was a hand&s;ome building in <HI>Summer
<PB N="13" REF="021188_0009_0FB29E9F8C52E458">
Street,</HI> he took me out to &s;hew to another child in petticoats, who cried &s;adly to po&s;&s;e&s;s me; but was told by his mamma, that I was his brother's property, and that <HI>Henry</HI> mu&s;t keep me, becau&s;e, on <HI>Monday</HI> he was going to a <HI>boarding &s;chool.</HI> Some company &s;oon af|ter coming into the apartment, the lady de|&s;ired her &s;on to take care of me until a more convenient opportunity.</P>
<P>I &s;oon found by their conver&s;ation, my new ma&s;ter had been brought up with great tender|ne&s;s by his mother, who was a widow; and was to go to &s;chool on the day abovementioned for the fir&s;t time. That a great number of toys had been purcha&s;ed to allure him into this mea&s;ure, and to &s;ooth his &s;orrows at the thoughts of a &s;eparation.</P>
<P>As he had no opportunity to play with me the remainder of the evening. I lay &s;nug in his pocket until he went to bed: when he took me out, and expatiated to a footman, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> to undre&s;s, on the plea&s;ure he &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> him&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> wi&s;hed

the next day had not been <HI>Sunday,</HI> as it would prevent his enjoyment. This was certainly a fault, but he was very young and incon&s;iderate; and it is to be hoped, that when he grew older he acquired more wi&s;dom. The next day he did not <HI>play</HI> with me indeed; but he took me out of his pocket a great number of times to look at; and even while he was at church (which was highly blameable) felt, to know if I was &s;ecure: A proof he was but too inatten|tive to his employment. But greatly as I had been favoured by his notice, the time was now come when I was to experience his entire neglect.</P>
<P>His mother, who had cautiou&s;ly avoided the mention of his departure, in the evening pre&s;&s;ed his hand with &s;ome emotion, and told him, &s;he hoped that now he was going to a di&s;tance from her in&s;tructions, he would not forget what &s;he had taken &s;uch pains to incul|cate. I am afraid, my dear <HI>Henry,</HI> added &s;he, wiping her eyes, as if &s;ome du&s;t had flown into them, though in reality to clear them from

tho&s;e tears &s;he could not re&s;train, I am &s;adly afraid, that when you have left home, you will pay but little attention to tho&s;e admoni|tions which you have hitherto &s;o much regard|ed. There may, among&s;t the number of boys you will meet with at the large &s;chool to which you are going, be &s;ome, who will wickedly laugh at your ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e duties, which I flatter my&s;elf, you will always continue to re&s;pect. But remember there are &s;ome obliga|tions, my dear boy, which nothing on earth
<PB N="16" REF="021188_0012_0FB29EA66E455A28">
can di&s;pen&s;e with. Among the&s;e is a &s;trict re|gard to truth and &s;incerity. However your intere&s;t may lead you &s;o the commi&s;&s;ion of de|ceit, be a&s;&s;ured you will reap no fruit from its indulgence; but remor&s;e in your own mind, and contempt from every one around you. If you are guilty of a fault, let me per&s;uade you, rather to &s;ubmit to the puni&s;hment which it de&s;erves (and which may be often mitigated by an hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion) than to endeavour to con|ceal it by a lie. You have always hitherto been above the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> meanne&s;s, and I only de&s;ign to caution you now, becau&s;e you will be expo&s;ed to tho&s;e temp|tations from which I have ever been careful to &s;ecure you. I tru&s;t likewi&s;e that you will be a&s;&s;iduous to cultivate a peaceable and kind di&s;|po&s;ition; for however <HI>fighting</HI> and <HI>revenge</HI> may be wrongly accounted the marks of <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> be|lieve me, that <HI>true courage</HI> can never con&s;i&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a willingne&s;s to <HI>offend,</HI> or a captious inclination to be di&s;plea&s;ed. The&s;e maxims which you have hitherto been taught to reverence, will
<PB N="17" REF="021188_0013_0FB29EA782498688">
perhaps be derided by your &s;choolfellows, as the weak advice of a <HI>mother,</HI> who can know nothing of <HI>boyi&s;h</HI> contentions. But I tru&s;t, that you, my &s;on, who&s;e affection for that mother is undoubted, will not &s;o ill repay my &s;olici|tude as to de&s;pi&s;e the&s;e in&s;tructions when you are at a di&s;tance from my embraces. Be a&s;|&s;ured that I am your <HI>be&s;t friend,</HI> and would never de&s;ire you to do, or forbear any thing, which will tend to make you beloved and re|&s;pected. <HI>Henry,</HI> who had been holding me in his hand without any de&s;ign of playing, from the time his mother began her di&s;cour&s;e; but had merely been rubbing me about with his fingers, now laid me ha&s;tily on the table, and throwing his arms round her, &s;obbed forth an a&s;&s;ent to her advice; a&s;&s;uring her, that he would never forget her admonition, and that he loved her too well to di&s;obey them: while the lady, overcome by her &s;on's emotion, joined her tears to his, and embraced him with an equal ardour of tenderne&s;s and affection. As

to your learning, &s;aid &s;he, after a pau&s;e, I am per&s;uaded that emulation, and de&s;ire to equal, if not exceed your companions, will in&s;pire you with application; and I &s;hall be much di&s;|appointed to hear you are remi&s;s in that article. I hope, that without con&s;idering it as a ta&s;k, your affection will di&s;po&s;e you to write fre|quently to me, as you well know nothing can give me equal plea&s;ure. The young gentleman was here &s;ummoned to &s;upper, and left me on the table, from which place I was not remov|ed
<PB N="19" REF="021188_0015_0FB29EAA405E67F8">
until the next morning, when a &s;ervant ha&s;ti|ly carried me down &s;tairs to my ma&s;ter, who was in a po&s;t chai&s;e with two gentlemen, and who put me with a melancholy air into his pocket. I &s;hall not detain my readers with any account of our journey, or the reception he met with from Mr. <HI>Verber,</HI> the per&s;on who kept the &s;chool; but proceed to inform them, that Ma&s;ter <HI>Henry</HI> was conducted by this gentleman into the play yard, where he left him; telling him to amu&s;e him&s;elf with his new companions. He wanted courage to advance, and had rather have retired to give vent to the affliction which he felt at a &s;eparation from his beloved mother (and the de&s;ertion of his uncles who had ac|companied him) that lady having declined that office from a fear of increa&s;ing his di&s;tre&s;s. Some of the boys &s;urveyed him in &s;ilence, and quietly marched off: the older ones took no no|tice of a child &s;o much their inferiour, and &s;ome of the young ones proclaimed the arrival of a <HI>new boy.</HI> with a noi&s;e to which he was quite un|accu&s;tomed. Several however, who&s;e diffidence
<PB N="20" REF="021188_0016_0FB29EABC04E79D8">
was &s;eldom any re&s;traint, acco&s;ted him with an enquiry after his name, family, and place of abode; and concluded with a&s;king, in the tech|nical term of the &s;chool, whether he had brought any <HI>prog.</HI> To this la&s;t que&s;tion, as he really did not under&s;tand it, <HI>Henry</HI> returned no an&s;wer until it was explained to mean, whe|ther he had any cakes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to di&s;po&s;e of. He replied in the affirmative; but his baggage was not in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and therefore he could not &s;atisfy their demand. At la&s;t, however, he took me from, his pocket, and was going to play with a greater degree of freedom than he had yet a&s;&s;umed, when, with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, he heard the boys addre&s;s him and each other by their <HI>&s;irname,</HI> without any di&s;tinction of <HI>Ma&s;|ter,</HI> or <HI>Sir,</HI> to which terms he had always been accu&s;tomed. He made this ob&s;ervation the next day to one of his playfellows, and was, in con&s;equence of it, ridiculed with the ap|pellation of <HI>Sir Ma&s;ter,</HI> an epithet which was intended to convey peculiar deri&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> &s;oon found that his &s;kill in &s;pinning a
<PB N="21" REF="021188_0017_0FB29EB1AB39B068">
top, was greatly inferiour to his companions; and a great boy one day who liked my appear|ance, told him, he would exchange tops with him, or offered to to&s;s up for me, to which he ignorantly con&s;ented. A halfpenny was pro|duced, and <HI>Henry</HI> twice called out <HI>heads,</HI> and it turning up the rever&s;e, I was declared the property of <HI>Frank Powel,</HI> to the great di&s;ap|pointment of my ma&s;ter, who did not like to re&s;ign me, and who had not under&s;tood the intention of the propo&s;al; but wanted much to keep me in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. All the boys, however, being unanimous in the opinion, that matters had been fairly conducted, I was re|luctantly delivered by poor <HI>Henry</HI> to a new owner. <HI>Powel</HI> was near fourteen, remarkably &s;prightly and active, and e&s;teemed by his com|panions one of the clevereth boys in the &s;chool. He &s;urveyed me with great plea&s;ure, and ran to a number of his playmates, who were play|ing at pegtop in a circle. My ma&s;ter &s;oon entered me in the li&s;t, and I was unfortunately &s;o little acquainted with the game, that I did
<PB N="22" REF="021188_0018_0FB29EB4016FDBE0">
not under&s;tand how to extricate my&s;elf. I met here with two of my brethren, who informed me, that all our &s;pecies who were introduced
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
into this fatal inclo&s;ure, would attempt to &s;plit us, and make their own e&s;cape: and I had a melancholy proof of the truth of this intelli|gence in the very top who communicated it, as it immediately experienced the fate above|mentioned; and, I &s;aw with horror, one which belonged to my own ma&s;ter cleave it through the middle. The peg, which was a valuable
<PB N="23" REF="021188_0019_0FB29EB9C7454460">
one, as it was of ten <HI>acorns,</HI> was immediately declared to be his prize, and he took it up with an air of triumph and &s;atisfaction. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the unea&s;ine&s;s I felt at this &s;pectacle, which was encrea&s;ed when ano|ther was thrown in, which approached &s;o near as twice to a&s;&s;ault my &s;ides with great violence; the third time, however, effected my deliver|ance, and drove me beyond the limits which had been marked for the conte&s;t. <HI>Powel</HI> &s;natch|ed me up with an ardour of joy, and the bell ringing for &s;upper, he ha&s;tened in doors, and devoted the re&s;t of the time until he went to bed, to execute the ta&s;k which Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> had allotted him.</P>
<P>The quick manner in which he di&s;patched, and the facility with which he comprehended his learning, gained him the favour of his ma&s;|ter, and excited the envy of his &s;chool fellows. But the con&s;tant good nature with which he behaved to them, inclined them at the &s;ame time to love and re&s;pect him. His invariable honour, and uncorrupted hone&s;tly had been &s;o often di&s;|tingui&s;hed,
<PB N="24" REF="021188_0020_0FB29EBC4E18F2A0">
that Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> deputed to his charge, the payment of their weekly allowance to about twenty boys. His commi&s;&s;ions he had executed with univer&s;al credit and &s;atisfaction; until one day, when <HI>Jack Growler,</HI> who was of a mo&s;t wicked and malignant di&s;po&s;ition, declar|ed that he had been cheated, of &s;ixpence, and that he would appeal to his ma&s;ter for redre&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Powel.</HI> who&s;e only fault was in general to be too pa&s;&s;ionate in the vindication of his conduct, di&s;dained on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion to an&s;wer the charge, and treated <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> with the mo&s;t provoking contempt&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">elling him, that he was welcome to make what complaints he plea&s;ed, &s;ince he neither &s;cared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cared for his accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>This behaviour inflamed <HI>Jack</HI> to much, that though he &s;oon after found the money, which he had dropped when he received it, he was yet determined to be revenged; and both go|ing up to &s;hew their exerci&s;e to Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> at the &s;ame time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the &s;ixpence in deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">te&punc; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">

<HI>Frank's</HI> pocket, and &s;oon after alledging, that when <HI>Powel</HI> had paid him nine pence, which
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
was the &s;um due to him, he had taken back the &s;ixpence, and refu&s;ed to re&s;tore it, de|claring that he had paid the whole.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> immediately &s;ummoned the ac|cu&s;ed party to defend him&s;elf, who very warmly retorted upon <HI>Growler</HI> the charge of meanne&s;s, malice, and detraction, and declared that he had delivered him the whole; prote&s;ting in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that he had never touch|ed
<PB N="26" REF="021188_0022_0FB29EC215A9CE90">
or &s;een it &s;ince. His companions joined in this account, and confirmed it by &s;aying, the money was as remarkable as I de&s;cribed. Upon which their ma&s;ter ordered them both to be &s;earched, which afforded no &s;mall degree of plea&s;ure to <HI>Growler,</HI> who fir&s;t &s;ubmitted to the command, and e&s;caped with greater honour than fell to the &s;hare of the innocent <HI>Powel,</HI> in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the &s;ixpence was found. A|mazed, confounded, and provoked to the high|e&s;t degree at this unexpected accident, my poor ma&s;ter could not contain his indignation. He loudly repeated his prote&s;tations of innocence, and laid the blame of treachery and deceit with great ju&s;tice on his accu&s;er. But &s;till appear|ances were &s;o much in his disfavour, that Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> &s;ternly told him, his pa&s;&s;ions ri&s;ing to &s;uch exce&s;s, was a confirmation of his guilt; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, that unle&s;s he could clear him&s;elf from the imputation, he mu&s;t expect the &s;evere&s;t pun|i&s;hment, as his crime appeared of the mo&s;t com|plicated nature; comprehending a charge of deceit, lying, and fraud; crimes of &s;uch mag|nitude,
<PB N="27" REF="021188_0023_0FB29EC303143540">
as he never <HI>did,</HI> nor ever <HI>would</HI> pardon. He then ordered him to deliver up the money with which he had been intru&s;ted, as he was not worthy the office of his &s;ecretary, until his character was cleared, and his innocence made manife&s;t. He was likewi&s;e ordered to confine|ment in a &s;mall room, which was called the Ba&s;|tile, becau&s;e it had but one window, which was a &s;ky light; and whoever was thought de&s;erving this puni&s;hment, was bani&s;hed from all the re&s;t of his companions, and &s;ecluded from every amu&s;ement. All the toys which were found in his pocket were confi&s;cated to Mr. <HI>Verber,</HI> who took me as part of that number, and depo&s;ited me in a drawer in his own &s;tudy; where I remained in a &s;tate of quietne&s;s and in|action for &s;ome time. The companions of my &s;ecluded &s;tate were a <HI>teatotum,</HI> which had been &s;eized from a boy who &s;pun it in &s;chool time when he ought to have been writing; a bag of <HI>marbles</HI> that had forfeited their liberty from their ma&s;ter's having rolled them on the &s;eat of the pew at church; together with an
<PB N="28" REF="021188_0024_0FB29EC482B21FE0">
exceeding good <HI>ball,</HI> which had been thrown up again&s;t the hou&s;e, and made its way through the parlour window; and a <HI>drum battledore,</HI> and curious <HI>&s;huttlecock,</HI> which the owner had u&s;ed in &s;chool time, when he was di&s;patched on another errand; and which had prolonged his &s;tay until Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> had di&s;covered his em|ployment. After &s;ome time this gentleman took me out, and pre&s;ented me once more to his favourite <HI>Powel,</HI> who&s;e character had been fully vindicated, as I &s;oon learned; and who was now rein&s;tated in his ma&s;ter's favour, and re&s;tored to his former di&s;tinction. With a &s;mile of complacence, Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> gave me back to my ma&s;ter, and a&s;&s;ured him, it was with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure he congratulated him on the complete manife&s;tation of his innocence: at the &s;ame time, &s;aid he, I mu&s;t blame you for that indi&s;creet warmth, with which on all oc|ca&s;ions, you are apt to defend your&s;elf; and which will ever be an injury to the be&s;t cau&s;e; and, I a&s;&s;ure you, more inclined me to ima|gine you to be guilty, than any other argu|ment
<PB N="29" REF="021188_0025_0FB29EC8C659D2F0">
could have done. Be convinced, <HI>Powel,</HI> that virtue can never be <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;ted,</HI> but may be often <HI>hurt</HI> by the indulgence of pa&s;&s;ion. How|ever, I tru&s;t that you will have &s;o much good &s;en&s;e as to improve from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of pa&s;t failings; and I do in&s;i&s;t upon your giving up all thoughts of per&s;onal revenge again&s;t your accu&s;er, who&s;e puni&s;hment I &s;hall take into my own hands; and I hope that you are too gene|rous to think of bearing future ill will and enmity again&s;t him, &s;ince the be&s;t way to prove your own &s;uperiority and merit, will be by a generous forgivene&s;s; and I &s;hould be extreme|ly &s;orry to be obliged, through your violence to him, to involve you in a &s;imilar condemna|tion. <HI>Powel</HI> expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at his ma&s;ter's approbation, and thanking him for the continuance of his confidence, with a low bow left the room.</P>
<P><HI>Jack Growler,</HI> as I afterwards found, had di&s;covered his treachery, by boa&s;ting of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> to one of his friends; and rejoicing in that plan of revenge, which had involved the
<PB N="30" REF="021188_0026_0FB29EC9CCF70FB0">
innocent <HI>Powel</HI> in di&s;grace. But being over|heard by his ma&s;ter, he had puni&s;hed his wick|edne&s;s by a &s;evere flogging, and obliged him publickly to a&s;k pardon, and likewi&s;e for &s;ome weeks deprived him of his allowance, as that had been the in&s;trument of malevolence. And indeed I have often had occa&s;ion to remark in the &s;cenes in which I have been engaged, that however vice may triumph for a time, it is generally di&s;covered in the end, and meets with its de&s;erved retribution.</P>
<P>Soon after I was re&s;tored to my ma&s;ter, he went with four other boys (who had likewi&s;e obtained leave &s;o to do) to a neighbouring vil|lage, in order to purcha&s;e whipcord, ginger|bread, marbles, and &s;uch other things as they wanted. Ju&s;t as they &s;et out for this purpo&s;e, <HI>Powel</HI> came behind one of the party, who&s;e name was <HI>Tom Swallowell,</HI> to&s;&s;ed his handker|chief over his head, and a&s;ked him how he &s;hould like to walk all the way blindfold? Why I &s;hould not mind it a &s;traw, returned he, and could find the path, I warrant you, without any

a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I will lay you &s;ixpence to be &s;pent in chee&s;ecakes, which we will buy of the old pye woman, &s;aid <HI>Powel,</HI> that you cannot go as far as the turnpike without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if your eyes are bound up. Done! replied <HI>Tom,</HI> and I will bet you &s;ixpence that I can! but you &s;hall promi&s;e that you will not let me run into danger without telling me of it neither by going in the way of hor&s;es, or tumbling into a ditch. The&s;e articles agreed to, <HI>Swal|lowell</HI> &s;tood &s;till while they bound a handker|chief clo&s;e over his eyes, and he groped for|ward on his way. <HI>Tom,</HI> you mu&s;t know, was remarkably fond of eating, and &s;pent all his money in the purcha&s;e of tarts, fruit, and &s;uch kind of things; and at this time his ca&s;h was reduced to one poor two pence only; &s;o that he could not have immediately di&s;charged his wager had he lo&s;t it. As he was &s;o fond of good things, he would make trial of whatever came in his way, and <HI>ta&s;te</HI> all that was offered him; by which means he was often di&s;appoint|ed, and &s;ometimes made extremely &s;ick. He
<PB N="32" REF="021188_0028_0FB29ECCCDBB5D98">
had pur&s;ued his cour&s;e in various directions, to the great entertainment of his companions; &s;ometimes on one &s;ide of the road and &s;ome|times

on the other; one minute feeling for a po&s;t which he thought he had arrived at, again&s;t the rails of a hou&s;e; at another groping for a tree in the middle of the highway; and in &s;hort, appeared entirely ignorant at which part of his journey he was arrived. When they had got near half way, mother <HI>Mixwell,</HI> the pye woman, met them, and <HI>Tom</HI> was very earne&s;t to ta&s;te &s;ome of the contents of her ba&s;ket.
<PB N="33" REF="021188_0029_0FB29ED075611D88">
<HI>Grinmore</HI> determined to purcha&s;e a laugh on the occa&s;ion, and offered to give him a cu&s;tard if he could eat without his eyes. That <HI>Tom</HI> agreed to be no impediment, and <HI>Will,</HI> with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the re&s;t, prepared his pre&s;ent, by mixing with it a good quantity of cow dung, which lay very opportunely in the road, &s;ome cattle having ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed in their way to a neigh|bouring farm. <HI>Swallowell,</HI> who&s;e greedy di&s;|po&s;ition always engaged him to take a large mouthful, very eagerly received the cu&s;tard; had &s;oon occa&s;ion to repent his ha&s;te, and with|out thinking of his wager (one of the condi|tions of which was, that he &s;hould on <HI>no</HI> oc|ca&s;ion remove the bandage) he ha&s;tily pulled off the handkerchief, and began &s;pitting and &s;puttering in a manner truly diverting. <HI>Powel</HI> &s;oon demanded his &s;ixpence, as the for|feit of unbinding his eyes; but <HI>Tom</HI> very an|grily refu&s;ed; declaring that he had been cheated, and that the filthy cu&s;tard had been given him as a concerted mea&s;ure to make him lo&s;e the wager. <HI>Powel</HI> denied the charge; but re&s;ented &s;uch an affront to his honour: and
<PB N="34" REF="021188_0030_0FB29ED499B7C550">
<HI>Grinmore</HI> having diverted him&s;elf &s;ome time with the anger of both parties, at length avowed that it was entirely his doing, and that <HI>Frank</HI> was wholly innocent of &s;uch an in&s;iduous de&s;ign.</P>
<P>This, however, did not &s;atisfy the di&s;plea&s;ed <HI>Swallowell,</HI> who &s;till retained the ta&s;te of the cow dung &s;trongly in his mouth. He, therefore gave <HI>Powel</HI> a blow on his head as he was &s;toop|ing to buckle his &s;hoe. This da&s;tardly trick was &s;oon returned by <HI>Frank</HI> with &s;ome violence, who declared him&s;elf unwilling to fight; but that he would not tamely &s;tand &s;till to be thra&s;hed in &s;uch a cowardly manner, by a boy to whom he was &s;uperiour. After drubbing him &s;ome time he walked on with his compan|ions, and left battered <HI>Tom</HI> rolling in the mid|dle of the road, to ta&s;te a &s;econd time, the cow dung which had occa&s;ioned the quarrel, and into the mid&s;t of which his antagoni&s;t had thrown him.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he was ri&s;ing, and trying to wipe off the dirt and du&s;t which his clothes were cov|ered with, he was overtaken by Mr. <HI>Verber;</HI> who was taking a walk with <HI>Powel's</HI> father,
<PB N="35" REF="021188_0031_0FB29ED6907FB970">
that gentleman having arrived a &s;hort time before on a vi&s;it to his &s;on.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter enquired of <HI>Swallowell</HI> the cau&s;e of his being in that dirty and wounded condi|tion; of which being informed, he &s;ent him home, and pur&s;ued his walk in que&s;t of his ad|ver&s;ary. The&s;e particulars I learned from a friend of my ma&s;ter's to whom <HI>Tom</HI> commu|nicated them on his return.</P>

to eat &s;ome gingerbread; after which he took me out, and was ju&s;t going to try my &s;kill in pegging&punc; halfpenny, when Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> and his father arrived. This unexpected &s;ight af|forded him great plea&s;ure, and he accompanied the latter to an inn in the abovementioned vil|lage where he had be&s;poke a dinner, promi&s;ing to return with his &s;on, and drink tea with Mr. <HI>Verber;</HI> that gentleman after mutual compli|ments, leaving us to return home. I &s;hall pa&s;s over the numberle&s;s enquiries which my ma&s;ter made after every individual of his fam|ily, not forgetting <HI>Bull</HI> the black coach hor&s;e, and his companion <HI>Smiler;</HI> together with a great many que&s;tions after <HI>Rover</HI> the young pointer, and old <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> the great yard dog, all which his father an&s;wered very kind|ly, and much to his &s;atisfaction. But as the reader is not acquainted with Mi&s;s <HI>Polly</HI> his &s;i&s;ter, or Mi&s;s <HI>Patty</HI> his little cou&s;in, and a thou&s;and <HI>Jacks, Toms,</HI> and <HI>Harrys,</HI> about who&s;e welfare he appeared to be extremely &s;olicitous, I &s;hall omit the&s;e particulars to give &s;ome ac|count of the advice which his father after|wards
<PB N="37" REF="021188_0033_0FB29ED988C577D8">
thought proper to give him, previous to their &s;eparation. He began by enquiring into the character of <HI>Swallowell;</HI> and <HI>Powel</HI> told him that he was a good natured boy e|nough, but &s;o greedy, that he was the je&s;t of the whole &s;chool, every one taking plea&s;ure to cheat him into a trial of &s;ome di&s;agreeable ta&s;te. And I find <HI>you</HI> have this morning been of that number, replied his father, which I &s;hould not be much inclined to blame, as &s;uch a hog like di&s;po&s;ition is a ju&s;t &s;ubject of ridi|cule. But I am very &s;orry <HI>Frank,</HI> the warmth of your temper has hurried you to add offence to raillery, and that you have concluded by fighting, what you began in play. You well know, my dear boy, the frequent caution I have given you upon this &s;ubject. I would by no means have you a <HI>coward,</HI> or afraid of be|ing <HI>hurt;</HI> but to be ever ready to &s;trike, or re|turn a blow, is a proof of the violence of your pa&s;&s;ion, but no argument of the ju&s;tice of your cau&s;e. If the boy you engage with is younger than your&s;elf, it is the highe&s;t degree of mean|ne&s;s to take &s;uch an unfair advantage of his in|feriority;
<PB N="38" REF="021188_0034_0FB29EDB0FBE7CB0">
and if he is older, you &s;tand but a bad chance. Nor do I think &s;uch conte&s;ts ei|ther prudent or honourable between <HI>equals</HI> in <HI>age</HI> and <HI>&s;trength.</HI> To forgive an injury, and overlook an affront, is a much higher in&s;tance of <HI>true</HI> magnanimity, than to obtain the mo&s;t complete conque&s;t; and, in general, tho&s;e are mo&s;t ready to fight, who have been the aggre&s;|&s;ors, and commenced the di&s;pute: but an ill action is not rendered more excu&s;able, or an unfair advantage reconciled to ju&s;tice by the blows of pa&s;&s;ion, or the taunts of provocation. Let me per&s;uade you, therefore, to forbear this

ungenerous u&s;e of that &s;trength, which was be&s;towed for nobler purpo&s;es; and endeavour to make your&s;elf <HI>beloved</HI> for your <HI>kindne&s;s,</HI> ra|ther than <HI>feared</HI> for your <HI>re&s;entment.</HI> "But if it was known, replied my ma&s;ter, that a boy would not <HI>fight,</HI> he would be &s;ubject to the in&s;ults of every urchin in the &s;chool, and might &s;tand &s;till, like a cock on a <HI>Shrove Tue&s;day,</HI> to be thrown at by every coward who was not afraid to be thra&s;hed in return; and I do maintain it to be <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> to keep up one's character with|out it." You are much mi&s;taken, young man, returned his father. I know what being at &s;chool is, and have been more years there than your&s;elf, and if you will petulantly take offence at every little mi&s;under&s;tanding, and be &s;oon &s;ubject to receive an affront, you may then find the cultivation of peace impo&s;&s;ible. But if on the contrary, you determine never to &s;trike the fir&s;t blow, and never return it but in &s;elf defence, you will find, that tho&s;e occa&s;ions will but &s;el|dom happen; and there will other in&s;tances ari&s;e, to prove your contempt of pain, and for

the exertion of your <HI>courage.</HI> In &s;hort, I think a boy who is afraid of being <HI>hurt,</HI> &s;hews a very <HI>weak</HI> mind; but one that delights to hurt others, proves that he has a very <HI>wicked</HI> one.</P>
<P><HI>Powel</HI> coloured at the keenne&s;s of this re|proof, and a&s;&s;ured his father, that he would en|deavour for the future to avoid quarrelling as much as he could. With this a&s;&s;urance the conver&s;ation was concluded, as they arrived at Mr. <HI>Verber's</HI> gate. What pa&s;&s;ed in their inter|view with that gentleman, I cannot tell; as on entering the hou&s;e, I was borrowed of my ma&s;ter by <HI>Ben Playful,</HI> and accompanied him into the yard. He was ju&s;t going to engage with another, in what might be called a race: which was, to try which of the two could fir&s;t chip a halfpenny from the middle, to the wall of the play ground. My antagoni&s;t, either from a defect in its form, or from a want of &s;kill in its owner, in vain e&s;&s;ayed to make the money advance; two or three times it ju&s;t re|moved it to a little di&s;tance, but more fre|quently failed of touching it at all. While my new ma&s;ter (for &s;uch he afterwards became)
<PB N="41" REF="021188_0037_0FB29EE290A11098">
with the mo&s;t expert dexterity, guided me for|wards to the &s;pot he wi&s;hed; and, at four &s;pins the halfpenny bounded forcibly again&s;t the wall. In a &s;econd and third game I met with equal &s;ucce&s;s, and <HI>Ben</HI> exulted in having borrow|ed the mo&s;t excellent <HI>Top</HI> he had ever met with. I was next engaged with one of my a&s;&s;ociates, whom I remember to have &s;een in the very drawer which I mentioned in the beginning of the&s;e memoirs, as the fir&s;t place I was introduced to. We had not much time for conver&s;ation, as we were each alternately pegged at an old bra&s;s button, with an inten|tion to determine its progre&s;s different ways. I &s;ought to impel it to the right, and my adver&s;ary with great a&s;&s;iduity, endeavoured to force it to the left hand; while the &s;ucce&s;s|ful labours of each, impre&s;&s;ed the looks of our employers, with alternate joy or regret. At length, however, when the di&s;tance had nearly thrown me into de&s;pair, <HI>Playful,</HI> who was an adept in every game, with great judgment threw me upon the button, and &s;truck it with
<PB N="42" REF="021188_0038_0FB29EE40821A270">
&s;uch force, that it flew &s;o great a di&s;tance as to &s;ecure the expectation of victory, which the next attempt put beyond a doubt. This mat|ter being thus decided, he was counting my <HI>acorns</HI> with great attention, when <HI>Powel</HI> joined him, and de&s;ired to have me re&s;tored; but <HI>Playful</HI> offered to give him a <HI>bat</HI> and <HI>ball</HI> in ex|change, and begged he might keep me; to which <HI>Powel</HI> con&s;enting, I became <HI>Ben Play|ful's</HI> property.

In the morning he was continually in &s;uch a hurry, that he &s;carce knew which of his le&s;&s;ons to attend; and it was no u&s;ual thing, to &s;ee him employ the little time he had in &s;earching for his books, which were generally thrown by with carele&s;s indifference the moment &s;chool hours were over. It may be ea&s;ily imagined, that in this &s;ituation he made greater proficien|cy in his play than his learning; and indeed he was &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in the one by many boys of ten, though he was him&s;elf thirteen years old: While in every amu&s;ement he was con&s;idered as the fir&s;t leader, and the mo&s;t expert of the whole &s;ociety. I had &s;oon rea&s;on to repent the di&s;po&s;ition of my new ma&s;ter, for although he commended me extremely, yet he complain|ed that I was too heavy, and propo&s;ed a plan for my improvement, which I &s;hudder to relate.</P>

My apprehen&s;ions on hearing &s;uch a dreadful intention were beyond de&s;cription; and had I been capable of tears, to be &s;ure I &s;hould have wept mo&s;t plentifully. This relief was however denied, and all I could do, was pa|tiently to expect my fate. Nor indeed would the pro&s;pect have been at all improved, by the indulgence of tho&s;e lamentations which are peculiar to the human &s;pecies. No one I &s;uppo&s;e likes to be in pain; but it is &s;urely a great degree of weakne&s;s, and extremely <HI>un|manly,</HI> to cry and blubber upon every occa&s;ion, as I have &s;een &s;ome boys do, while they at the &s;ame time refu&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary means of relief, and endure that unea&s;ine&s;s of which they are &s;o impatient, becau&s;e they want re&s;olution to take &s;ome nau&s;eous medicine which is pre|&s;cribed as a cure for their di&s;order.

To this <HI>Ben</HI> had great ob|jections; fir&s;t, becau&s;e he expected Mr. <HI>Verber</HI> to be di&s;plea&s;ed with the fracture of the gla&s;s, and for a &s;econd rea&s;on, as he had omitted, for the &s;ake of performing the above operation, to learn a ta&s;k which he had been ordered to get perfectly before night. His re&s;i&s;tance was however in vain; &s;o putting my peg into his wai&s;tcoat pocket, and the gardener taking my head in his left hand, while with the right he dragged my ma&s;ter along, we proceeded to the great parlour, where we found Mr. <HI>Ver|ber,</HI> two ladies and a gentleman.

The force of my fall had &s;unk a kind of bed, as it were, in which I partly repo&s;ed; but every moment as it en|crea&s;ed my danger, added to the dread which I experienced; and I had certainly been de&s;troyed in a few moments, as I felt the coals which &s;upported me give way, the fire having burnt

the time with the con&s;ideration, that however innocence may be expo&s;ed through the folly of others to misfortune and danger, yet &s;ome method will be ever found for its re&s;cue and protection.

he therefore kept him confined the re&s;t of the evening, until he had, in &s;ome degree, made amends for his former omi&s;&s;ion. When it was bed time, and he had repeated the le&s;|&s;on which he had &s;ince been very diligent to learn, he begged that I might be re&s;tored, promi&s;ing to behave with more caution for the future. I am &s;orry, <HI>Playful,</HI> replied Mr. <HI>Verber,</HI> that your idlene&s;s does &s;o frequently oblige me both to blame and to puni&s;h you. For my own credit I &s;hould certainly be de&s;i|rous to have you improve; but it is not of equal con&s;equence to any per&s;on, as it will in future be to your&s;elf.

<P>The next morning he ro&s;e very early with an intention of keeping his word. But un|luckily in feeling for a handkerchief, my head rolled out at the &s;ame time from his pocket. The temptation of completing his top be|fore &s;chool time became too great to be re|&s;i&s;ted, and going to &s;ome of his companions who had been of his party the preceding day, a con&s;ultation was held to determine to what top my peg &s;hould be joined; when after va|rious experiments with &s;everal others, it was decreed, that my divided parts &s;hould be a|gain reunited; and <HI>Playful</HI> ha&s;tily taking his hat, &s;craped off a little as it lay on his knee, and applying it to the end of my peg, in hopes of making it &s;pin lighter, thru&s;t it once more into its former po&s;ition.

telling one of his &s;chool fellows, that he ac|tually would play no longer than I kept up, before he went in to his &s;tudies, when the &s;chool bell rang, and obliged him to attend its dreaded but unavoidable &s;ummons.</P>
<P>With a heavy heart he put me into his pock|et, and going to a bench in the yard where he had left it, took up his book, reading his le&s;&s;on over as he &s;lowly crept along, until &s;top|ping a con&s;iderable time at a window in a pa&s;|&s;age which led to the &s;chool, one of the u&s;hers came &s;oftly behind, and giving him a hearty &s;troke with a cane upon his &s;houlders, told him to quicken his pace, for he was always <HI>lag la&s;t.</HI> The di&s;tre&s;s which he afterwards experienc|ed on account of his neglect, was a de&s;erved puni&s;hment, for his di&s;obedience to his father's advice, after a given promi&s;e to the contrary. But &s;o it will ever happen, where a fondne&s;s for amu&s;ement is &s;uffered to prevail to &s;uch exce&s;s, as to engro&s;s that portion of time, which ought to be more u&s;efully employed.</P>

My ma&s;ter and his companion, who perceived their hor&s;e &s;et off with &s;uch uncommon &s;peed, immedi|ately followed him with all the ha&s;te they could make, and were ju&s;t time enough to be witne&s;&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> (though not to prevent) the overthrow, which they mo&s;t &s;adly deplored.

to his ma&s;ter, that he was incapable of u&s;ing the proper methods of procuring him liberty; at length however, with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a countryman who was coming from a potatoe field, the hor&s;e was extricated, and the cart pronounced incapable of proceeding. The point was now to be determined, whether they &s;hould go home with the hor&s;e, and in|form his ma&s;ter of the accident, or fir&s;t endea|vour to get a cartwright who lived in the vil|lage, to come and in&s;pect the damage, and try to repair it.

Mr. <HI>Bakeall,</HI> his owner. <HI>George,</HI> who was in general a tolerable good boy, felt on this oc|ca&s;ion his fears prove too great for his honour; and propo&s;ed to his companion, to inform his ma&s;ter, that he had never left the cart but upon account of his bu&s;ine&s;s, and that the appearance of a man &s;uddenly &s;tarting out of a hedge, had frightened the hor&s;e, who had ran away with him, and nearly killed him by the over&s;et of the cart, which all his endeavours could not prevent; adding, that he would contrive to get a brui&s;e on his &s;houlder, and a &s;cratch on the face, to prove the truth of his a&s;&s;ertion, and which would incline his ma&s;ter to pity his &s;ufferings and mitigate his anger.

in this <HI>particular</HI> in&s;tance, the dread he was in of his ma&s;ter's di&s;plea&s;ure.

<P><HI>Charles</HI> repeated his rea&s;ons to di&s;&s;uade him from &s;o wrong a determination, and enforced them by &s;aying, if he was a&s;ked any que&s;tions about the affair, he would certainly declare the <HI>truth;</HI> which mu&s;t involve <HI>Mealwell</HI> in di&s;|grace, and reveal the deceit. <HI>George,</HI> in con|&s;equence of this &s;peech, grew extremely angry, and called his opponent a <HI>mean &s;pirited, ill na|tured, treacherous</HI> fellow; declared he &s;hould &s;corn to betray a friend, and incur the odious character of a <HI>mi&s;chief making tell tale.</HI> That if he <HI>did</HI> u&s;e him &s;o ba&s;ely, he would fight with him wherever he met him, and never &s;peak

My father, <HI>George,</HI> &s;aid he, though he is but a poor &s;hoemaker, and has, as you know, a large fam|ily, yet has been very kind to us, and taken great pains to teach us as much as he can; and has got me into the charity &s;chool, be|cau&s;e he &s;ays it is a fine thing to be able to read and write: And my elde&s;t brother, who is two years older than I am, was taken a great while ago, into farmer <HI>Wood's</HI> family, who would have provided for him, and did find him in clothes; and gave him &s;everal pre&s;ents.

having a great objection to every kind of pain, his knocks were &s;o gentle, as to make but lit|tle impre&s;&s;ion. He afterwards attempted to &s;cratch his face, fir&s;t with his nails, which he wanted re&s;olution to u&s;e effectually, and af|terwards with a piece of bramble which he

tore out of a hedge, and which &s;ucceeded bet|ter than he wi&s;hed, as a thorn got into his eye, and occa&s;ioned the mo&s;t violent agony: A ju&s;t reward for the wickedne&s;s of his inten|tion, in &s;o wilfully re&s;olving to deceive his ma&s;ter.

<P>He then enquired by what means it had happened, and Mr. <HI>Bakeall</HI> gave the account which he had received from <HI>George,</HI> adding, that his man was gone to &s;ee what was become of the hor&s;e and cart. At the conclu&s;ion of the hi&s;tory, Mr. <HI>Keen</HI> hoped there was no <HI>lye</HI> in the ca&s;e, as he &s;aw <HI>Mealwell</HI> at play with another boy at pegtop; and the hor&s;e and cart &s;tand|ing without a driver in the road, as he came from vi&s;iting a patient. He &s;aid likewi&s;e, that he knew the other boy by &s;ight, and believed it to be <HI>Charles Heedmore,</HI> the &s;hoemaker's &s;on.</P>
<P><HI>George,</HI> who was now in a terrible fright, yet was unwilling to confe&s;s that he had told an untruth; &s;o to prove the veracity of his former

a&s;&s;ertion, was obliged to &s;upport it by repeated lies. Thus does the commi&s;&s;ion of one errour lead to numberle&s;s crimes; and his fir&s;t fault in leaving his bu&s;ine&s;s to attend un&s;ea&s;onably to his play, was the occa&s;ion of &s;uch a train of wickedne&s;s and guilt.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bakeall,</HI> who before the pre&s;ent event, had never any rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the veracity of his apprentice, was &s;trongly inclined to give credit to the hi&s;tory he had related; yet, at the &s;ame time, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cover the <HI>truth,</HI> that the &s;ucce&s;s of a <HI>lye,</HI> if it proved to be one, might not encourage him to any future deceit. He accordingly fir&s;t &s;earched his pocket, and finding me there, was rather &s;taggered in his good opinion of <HI>Mealwell,</HI> as he knew he had not a top in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the morning, having heard him at break|fa&s;t wi&s;h he could afford to purcha&s;e one. Tak|ing me, therefore, in his hand, he left <HI>George</HI> in charge of Mr. <HI>Keen,</HI> and proceded to <HI>Heed|more's</HI> father, in hopes of learning further about the affair. Having told his bu&s;ine&s;s, the

His father immediately enquired what had occa&s;ioned his not being at home at dinner? To which que&s;tion he at fir&s;t

And was you at &s;chool as &s;oon as you ought to have been? &s;aid his father.

But I am afraid, father, when you know what has been the con&s;equence of my folly, <HI>you</HI> will be le&s;s merciful.

Why child, you never had them! I gave them to <HI>Jack</HI> to carry home; and you cannot have had them, for you have never been in the hou&s;e &s;ince. Here was a &s;ubterfuge, by which <HI>Charles,</HI> had he been &s;o inclined, might for the pre&s;ent have &s;aved him&s;elf, and laid the blame on his brother.

His father then in&s;i&s;ted upon knowing with whom he had been at play, as probably they had been &s;tolen by his companion. <HI>Charles</HI> a&s;&s;ured him that could not be the ca&s;e; and afterwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s in vindication of his friend's cha|racter,

What is your rea&s;on, <HI>Charles,</HI> rejoined Mr. <HI>Heedmore,</HI> for requiring &s;ilence? was there any great crime in playing with you at pegtop?

I will tell you, that when we parted, he was determined to tell his ma&s;ter &s;uch a &s;hocking <HI>lie</HI> about the cart, which the one eyed hor&s;e ran away with and broke, and to hurt his own eyes, and brui&s;e his &s;houlder, to prove the truth of his &s;tory, that it has quite altered my opinion of him; though I believe him to be &s;trictly hone&s;t, and that he would not cheat any body for the world. Tho&s;e who are &s;o wicked as to <HI>lie,</HI> returned Mr. <HI>Heedmore,</HI> will be guilty (at lea&s;t are to be &s;u&s;pected) of any crime, &s;ince to forfeit your word, is to break every tie of honour; it is like the hemp with which we &s;ew &s;hoes, <HI>Charles;</HI> if that fails, they will come in pieces, you know, and be rotten, and good for nothing. So if people &s;ay one thing, and mean another, there is no knowing when you may tru&s;t their tale. But pray, how came the bea&s;t to &s;et off? he looks &s;taid and &s;teady enough! I &s;hould never &s;u&s;pect him of a prancing freak! Why, father, replied <HI>Charles,</HI> we were bu&s;y on the ground upon the left hand &s;ide of the road, and <HI>George</HI> had ju&s;t taken up
<PB N="77" REF="021188_0073_0FB29F444EFEAF20">
the <HI>Top</HI> in a wooden &s;poon, which he had in his pocket, and as ill luck would have it, a noi&s;y drove of cackling gee&s;e came waddling along, with two men with tho&s;e abominable long &s;ticks and a rag at the end; &s;o that al|together frightened <HI>Trot,</HI> and he took to his heels before we were aware, and though we directly made after him, yet away he galloped with the cart, until he came clo&s;e to farmer <HI>Ploughwell's</HI> great dunghill and on a hillock of dirt, tumbled him&s;elf down, and over&s;et bread and every thing el&s;e. The quartern loaves, and threepenny, and pecks, and two bags of flour, all rolled into the middle of the road; but as it is a dry day, that was no great harm; the wor&s;t matter of all was, the cart was broken, and the harne&s;s much dam|aged, and &s;o for fear his ma&s;ter &s;hould be angry, as he certainly would be, <HI>Mealwell</HI> was re&s;olved to <HI>lie,</HI> and get off if he can that way. And did you endeavour (enquired his father) to per&s;uade him not to do &s;o? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> know that was his mind, and leave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">

Yes, that I did, an&s;wered <HI>Charles!</HI> but he would have his own way, and de&s;ired me to march home, and &s;o I did at la&s;t when I found all I could &s;ay was to no purpo&s;e. Well, you are a good boy, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Heedmore,</HI> but I hardly think it right to know he is telling &s;uch a fal&s;hood, without letting it be known; and I think his ma&s;ter ought to be acquainted with his tricks. He then concluded with lament|ing the lo&s;s his &s;on's carele&s;&s;ne&s;s had occa&s;ion|ed; but &s;aid, he would convince him that he was not le&s;s merciful than his &s;chool ma&s;ter, by pardoning his fault for the &s;ake of encou|ragement to his veracity; a&s;&s;uring him, that <HI>truth</HI> would be at all times its own reward.

His ma&s;ter informed Mr. <HI>Keen</HI> of the &s;ucce&s;s of his vi&s;it, and concluded with high commendations of <HI>Charles Heedmore;</HI> and after which, turning to <HI>George,</HI> he &s;aid very calmly, you had good rea&s;on to think I &s;hould have been angry at an accident which has hap|pened entirely from your idlene&s;s and folly. But you &s;hall find, my lad, that your trimming &s;hall be pretty hand&s;omely increa&s;ed, for the lies you have told about it! So &s;aying, he took him by the &s;houlder, and turned him tow|ards the door.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Keen</HI> hoped his eye would &s;oon be well, and &s;aid, he was &s;orry he had behaved in &s;o wicked a manner as to de&s;erve cha&s;ti&s;ement; but hoped, it would be a warning to him in future, that in doing a wrong action no one can be &s;ure of &s;ecrecy; and that to be faith|ful to <HI>truth</HI> upon all occa&s;ions, is the only way to be &s;ecure from evil.

willing to proceed. So taking hold of his arm, Mr. <HI>Bakeall,</HI> who was near the hou&s;e, dragged him on, and fir&s;t examined the brui&s;e on his &s;houlder, which was &s;carcely vi&s;ible, but which he promi&s;ed his &s;trokes &s;hould much increa&s;e; and then leading him to a tree in a little yard, where the man was enter|ing with old <HI>Trot</HI> and the &s;hattered cart, he &s;natched his whip in a hurry, and tying him up with &s;ome rope, which had fa&s;tened the broken harne&s;s, thra&s;hed him &s;o violently, that the blood followed his &s;trokes before he con|cluded; which was &s;ufficiently vi&s;ible, as he had taken off his clothes before he began. Thus ended an affair of which I had been the in|nocent occa&s;ion, and which <HI>George</HI> imagined he in &s;ome mea&s;ure revenged a &s;hort time af|ter, when finding me on the feat of an old ea&s;y chair, where Mr. <HI>Bakeall</HI> had thrown me, he took me up, and abu&s;ed me with as much warmth as if I had been able to defend my|&s;elf; concluding with a declaration, that I &s;hould never again get him a thra&s;hing; and

that but for me, he had been in a whole &s;kin. So &s;aying, he whirled me with great violence into the high road, where I narrowly e&s;caped falling on a &s;harp &s;tone, which mu&s;t inevita|bly have &s;plit and rendered me u&s;ele&s;s; but fortunately I rolled on the edge of an oppo|&s;ite path way where I was &s;oon after picked up, for the fir&s;t time in my life, by a young lady, who was walking home with her maid from a boarding &s;chool, at &s;ome little di&s;tance. While I lay in this &s;ituation a reflection natu|rally

aro&s;e, on the anger which children often expre&s;s again&s;t inanimate things; which by making a wrong u&s;e of, have proved, as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the mean of &s;ubjecting them to di&s;grace. Had <HI>George</HI> when he found me at Mr. <HI>Verber's,</HI> been content to put me in his pocket until his bu&s;ine&s;s was fini&s;hed, he might have played without fear or blame. But by doing what his con&s;cience told him was im|proper, he carle&s;sly left the cart to the care of old <HI>Trot,</HI> who finding him&s;elf free from the re&s;traint of a driver, occa&s;ioned the mi&s;chief, which <HI>Mealwell's</HI> care ought to have prevented. But was the poor <HI>Pegtop</HI> to blame in all this? Did the <HI>Pegtop</HI> make him tell a lie, and for|feit his honour and reputation? Was that all accountable for his per&s;everence in an untruth? or, for the thorn which he put into his eye? In &s;hort, I think it will be evident to every reader, that the fault was all his own; and that the poor <HI>Pegtop</HI> could not ju&s;tly be charged with any &s;hare of his guilt. But to return to my new mi&s;tre&s;s, who was a girl
<PB N="84" REF="021188_0080_0FB29F507B36B100">
about ten years old, and who appeared greatly plea&s;ed with what &s;he had found. Taking me up, and &s;hewing me to the &s;ervant who attended her, &s;aid with much glee, "See, <HI>Betty,</HI> what I have got! I &s;hall now have a <HI>Top</HI> as well as my brothers, who will not lend me theirs, becau&s;e they &s;ay it is not a <HI>girl's</HI> play thing." She then hopped along, fir&s;t on one leg, and then on the other, until we came to a hand&s;ome hou&s;e, where two genteel look|ing boys were &s;itting on a chain, which en|clo&s;ed a round plot of gla&s;s before it. Your &s;ervant, Mi&s;s! &s;aid the elde&s;t; what, are you ju&s;t returned from &s;chool? and how do all the young ladies do? And what, interrupted the other, have you got in your hand, <HI>Sophy?</HI> Who&s;e <HI>Top</HI> is that?

It is my own, Sir? replied my mi&s;tre&s;s with an air of triumph, and I do not want yours again, I promi&s;e you! So &s;aying, &s;he was walking in doors; but they both in an in&s;tant pur&s;ued her, and

forced away the top, to examine whether it was the one they &s;u&s;pected. Ju&s;t at this in|&s;tant a gentleman, whom I afterwards found was their father, came up, and taking hold of the younge&s;t, "Pray, young man," &s;aid he, "what are you about? Is this behaving properly to your &s;i&s;ter? I am quite a&s;hamed of you! what is the matter, <HI>Sophy?"</HI> The young lady was going to &s;peak, but <HI>Frederick,</HI> the younge&s;t, without waiting for her an&s;wer, called out to Mr. <HI>Jack&s;on,</HI> She has got one of

our tops, Sir, and we are going to take it from her, that is all. It is not theirs, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, replied my mi&s;tre&s;s: I found it ju&s;t now in my way from &s;chool, and indeed it does not belong to them. The gentleman ac|cordingly took me from his &s;on, and pre&s;ent|ing me again to Mi&s;s <HI>Jack&s;on,</HI> &s;he ran into the hou&s;e, and a&s;ked a &s;ervant whom &s;he met in the hall, for a piece of cord; which &s;he &s;oon twi&s;ted round me, and began to make trial of my abili|ties. I &s;oon found &s;he was ignorant of the art, as &s;he &s;lung me down &s;o awkwardly, that I only rolled about, without being at all able to &s;pin.</P>
<P>Her brothers, who were not long before they paid her a vi&s;it were much diverted at her un|&s;ucce&s;sful attempt, and begged they might be permitted to try whether the fault was in me or their &s;i&s;ter; to which &s;he con&s;ented, upon their promi&s;e of returning me immediately. <HI>Edward,</HI> who was the elde&s;t, kept me up for near a min|ute; and I &s;pun &s;o well, as to &s;leep more &s;oundly than I had ever done before.

In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, though your &s;atire may be ju&s;tly pointed again&s;t &s;uch girls as forget the delicacy of their &s;ex, and behave improperly; yet, to addre&s;s them to a &s;i&s;ter, who is not guilty of this fault, and who was by no means to blame in keeping what was her own property, is, as I before &s;aid, no proof of your affection or kindne&s;s. To exult with a pretended &s;uperiority over <HI>the girls,</HI> as you are apt with an air of in&s;ult to expre&s;s your&s;elf, and to &s;neer at their amu&s;e|ments,

<P>A coxcomb, <HI>Edward,</HI> is a de&s;picable char|acter; and tho&s;e who are mo&s;t proud of their fancied advantages, will be commonly found to have the lea&s;t real merit. Never, therefore, pretend to boa&s;t of your learning, or de&s;pi&s;e <HI>women</HI> in <HI>general,</HI> or your <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI> in <HI>partic|ular,</HI> under the idea that you are &s;o much

wi&s;er, becau&s;e you under&s;tand a little <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> &s;ince &s;uch an affectation of &s;uperiority is equally de&s;picable in men or boys.</P>
<P>To di&s;regard the learned languages is a proof of an illiterate and uninformed mind, which from not knowing, is unacquainted with their nece&s;&s;ity and u&s;e; but to imagine, that wi&s;|dom is centered in the ancients, and that a knowledge of <HI>Homer, Virgil, Terence,</HI> or any other author you may read, will con&s;titute you a re&s;pectable character, is a mi&s;take which can only ari&s;e from ignorance.</P>
<P>The true u&s;e of learning is to improve the under&s;tanding, and enlarge our ideas; that is, to &s;hew the reader in the example of former times, what virtues made a man u&s;eful to &s;o|ciety, and acquired him reputation; and what vices rendered him hateful to others, and un|happy in him&s;elf. If therefore you neglect to make this u&s;e of your &s;tudies, you have but little rea&s;on to be proud of the advantage of a good education, &s;ince learning is to little purpo&s;e, if it will not teach you to govern

<P>This performance, continued Mr. <HI>Jack&s;on,</HI> when he had read to them the abovementioned ver&s;es, I do not recommend as a model in any re&s;pect, except in the good natured intention with which it is manife&s;tly written; but come, added he, I &s;ee the coach is ready, and your mother is waiting to accompany us to <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> So &s;aying, he went out of the room, and <HI>Ed|ward</HI> took me up, and putting me into his pocket, accompanied his father and brother to the carriage.</P>
<P>Nothing worth recording occured until we reached the metropolis, when a cart laden with wine &s;tood oppo&s;ite to a tavern, and hin|dered

our progre&s;s for &s;ome time; as on ac|count of a fire which had lately happened, the ruins were inclo&s;ed, and the &s;treet was too nar|row to make room for two carriages abrea&s;t. The young gentlemen &s;hewed their impatience at this delay, by kneeling upon the &s;eat to look through the front gla&s;s; then putting their heads out of the &s;ide window; and <HI>Edward</HI> taking me out to beguile the time, expre&s;&s;ed his unea&s;ine&s;s that the coachman would not proceed. At length an affair, which happened

on the path way clo&s;e to the place where they were detained, engro&s;&s;ed their attention, and furni&s;hed them with a &s;ubject of conver&s;ation for the remainder of the day. An old woman in a red cloak and tattered gown, was &s;elling oranges, apples, and che&s;nuts on a wheelbar|row; &s;ome of which were roa&s;ting in a little fire pot contrived for the purpo&s;e; when two genteel looking boys came up and demanded the price of &s;ome golden pippins. The wom|an, as &s;he was going to an&s;wer them, di&s;cov|ered that her child, who had been &s;itting by her on a little wooden &s;tool, had wandered to &s;ome di&s;tance, and was going to cro&s;s the &s;treet by it&s;elf; to prevent which, &s;he ran im|mediately to overtake it, and in the mean time, one of the mi&s;chievous boys, with a kick over|&s;et her wheelbarrow, and tumbled its con|tents into the mud. The laugh of exultation which the&s;e young mi&s;creants &s;et up on the oc|ca&s;ion, and the &s;ight of the rolling oranges, and ma&s;hed half roa&s;ted apples, &s;wimming down the kennel, exceedingly diverted my
<PB N="100" REF="021188_0096_0FB29F68D260F8A8">
ma&s;ter and his brother; until the unfortunate owner at her return, began her pity moving complaints. A croud having gathered round her, many of them laughed at the accident, and &s;ome ran away with the &s;poils, and began peeling the oranges they had picked up. Oth|ers blamed the unlucky monkey (as they called the boy) who had occa&s;ioned the mi&s;|chief. Matters, however, being once more quiet, Mr. <HI>Jack&s;on</HI> called the poor woman, and enquired into her &s;ituation. Why, &s;ir! &s;aid &s;he, I will tell you the truth! You &s;ee me re|duced to the la&s;t farthing I have in the world; for this morning I laid out four &s;hillings, which was all the money I was worth, in the&s;e oranges, apples, and che&s;nuts, and I declare I have tak|en but threepence to day; and I have three children, the elde&s;t but &s;ix years old, be&s;ides this little one, whom I was going to run after when that wicked boy kicked down my barrow. It is a hard ca&s;e, Sir! &s;aid &s;he, the tears run|ning down her cheeks, which &s;he wiped off with an old rag of coloured apron; and I
<PB N="101" REF="021188_0097_0FB29F6A4B914208">
owe for my rent, Sir! and &s;hall be turned with all my babes into the &s;treet, as I have now lo&s;t the two &s;hillings, which I promi&s;ed to carry home to my landlord; and he told me before I came out, <HI>that</HI> &s;hould be the ca&s;e, as he would not tru&s;t me any longer. But it is a &s;hocking thing to &s;ee my children cry for a mouthful of victuals, and not have it to give them; and &s;o I bought la&s;t night a quartern loaf, in&s;tead of paying him, which I did intend, but now I have nothing to give him; and we mu&s;t go to the pari&s;h, after all my labour to get an hone&s;t livelihood, having endeavoured all my life not to be a burden to any body. Mr. <HI>Jack&s;on,</HI> however made up her lo&s;s, and the coach once more proceeded on its <HI>journey. Frederick</HI> de|clared, he thought the boy was to blame to in|jure the woman; but added, that he could not help laughing to &s;ee the di&s;tance to which &s;ome of the pippins had rolled, and the &s;cramble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they occa&s;ioned among the mob; that a chimney &s;weeper had &s;lipped down over an orange, which he kicked away to prevent a girl

from &s;eizing; and with his bag of foot, had fal|len again&s;t a lady in a white jacket, and made her as black as him&s;elf; and that the gentle|man who was with her, had rapped the boy's

head with his cane, and &s;et him a howling like a cur. In &s;hort, continued he, it was rare fun! and I think, had not the woman been &s;o <HI>very</HI> poor, it was worth the money to &s;ee the confu&s;ion which it occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, replied his father with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> air, that the plea&s;ure with which you &s;urveyed that confu&s;ion, has made you forget the &s;uffer|ings
<PB N="103" REF="021188_0099_0FB29F742AA7B550">
which it <HI>might</HI> have cau&s;ed to the per&s;on, who&s;e living depends upon the &s;ucce&s;s of her little trade. Every one has a right to <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> be their &s;ituation in life ever &s;o low; and it is an additional degree of guilt to injure tho&s;e, who &s;tand mo&s;t in need of protection. It can|not therefore, in my mind, be con&s;idered as any proof of <HI>cleverne&s;s</HI> or <HI>wit,</HI> to &s;ee a boy throw down a barrow of fruit, over&s;et a &s;tall of gin|gerbread, trip up an old woman's heels, or perform any of tho&s;e feats of dexterity, which are apt to afford mirth to the giddy and incon|&s;iderate; &s;ince to do a fellow creature a mate|rial injury, for the &s;ake of &s;porting with their misfortunes, is to be wicked and inhuman; but is by no means entitled to commendation and applau&s;e. If you had been one of the children who was to be turned out of doors, or to loo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> your day's victuals in con&s;equence of this <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> exploit, I am apt to think you would form a different judgment of its merit, and be ready to execrate that wantonne&s;s of invention, which can &s;o unthinkingly &s;port with the unea&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="104" REF="021188_0100_0FB29E1ED428D3E0">
of others. Never, therefore, let the <HI>fun,</HI> or entertainment of &s;uch jokes make you in&s;en|&s;ible to the &s;erious mi&s;chiefs they may produce; and remember, that what, like the fable of the <HI>boys</HI> and <HI>frogs,</HI> may be <HI>play</HI> to you, is mi&s;ery perhaps to tho&s;e who&s;e property you &s;o abu&s;e. I recollect, added he, an in&s;tance of this kind, when I was at &s;chool, which produced &s;uch a di&s;mal event as I &s;hall never forget.</P>
<P>An old woman who lived in a cottage in the neighbourhood, and who&s;e character was as qui|et, good, and inoffen&s;ive as you can imagine; was neverthele&s;s, &s;ingled out by the boys, as a proper &s;ubject for their <HI>fun.</HI> She was very &s;hort and a little crooked, bent down with age and infirmities, and was guilty of the &s;hocking crime of <HI>wearing a high crowned hat:</HI> which had perhaps been in vogue in the days of her youth. This was &s;o high an offence, that they gave her the appellation of the <HI>Old Witch,</HI> and by this name &s;he was univer&s;ally known. Stigmatized with &s;uch an epithet of deri&s;ion, they thought there was no harm in making
<PB N="105" REF="021188_0101_0FB29E20C7269100">
her life unhappy, by every art which their in|vention could devi&s;e. They broke the only window of her cot, and as &s;oon as it was repair|ed, repeated the offence. A couple of &s;he a&s;&s;es which &s;he kept to &s;upply the neighbours with milk, and which were her chief &s;upport, they drove every day to a di&s;tance, into &s;uch places as they thought &s;he would lea&s;t think of &s;earch|ing for them; and this, as &s;he was <HI>lame,</HI> was a con&s;tant unea&s;ine&s;s to her. Several times they nailed up the door of her hut, and when &s;he was ab&s;ent, would pile up all the rubbi&s;h they could procure, to ob&s;truct her entrance; and when &s;he made any complaints of the&s;e in|&s;ults to their ma&s;ters, they con&s;idered it as an unpardonable provocation, and vowed their vengeance for her ill nature. At length they determined on a &s;cheme, which they thought would effectually frighten the <HI>Old Witch,</HI> and make her fears afford them a &s;ubject of mirth.</P>
<P>This was, after &s;he went to bed (which was u&s;ually at an early hour) to make a bonfire be|fore her window; the flames of which would
<PB N="106" REF="021188_0102_0FB29E21CABBD938">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
confirm her in the apprehen&s;ion, that her dwel|ling was on fire, as they intended to make an outcry to that purpo&s;e. Accordingly the poor creature, who had fatigued her&s;elf in the day with wa&s;hing, was &s;oon a&s;leep; and they came with wa&s;hing, was &s;oon a&s;leep; and they came with much &s;atisfaction to execute their project. The fuel they had brought was &s;oon in a blaze; and &s;everal of them knocked with violence at the door, and cried out that &s;he would be burnt to death if &s;he did not make her e&s;cape. She im|mediately jumped out of bed, and in her ha&s;te and &s;urpri&s;e, &s;tumbled over a &s;mall wa&s;hing tub,
<PB N="107" REF="021188_0103_0FB29E2347503528">
in which &s;he had left &s;ome unfini&s;hed clothes: by which accident &s;he broke her leg, and was &s;o ill in con&s;equence of it, that though &s;he linger|ed above a twelvemonth after, it was thought to be, in &s;ome degree, the cau&s;e of her death. The <HI>de&s;ign</HI> of the&s;e boys, by no means extended &s;o far as to do her a real injury; but there is no cer|tainty that a mi&s;chievous intention will &s;top <HI>ex|actly</HI> where it was projected; and therefore a good natured di&s;po&s;ition, will rather lo&s;e the enjoyment of a <HI>joke</HI> than run the hazard of hurt|ing a fellow creature.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Jack&s;on</HI> concluded this &s;entence, they arrived at the end of their journey. They were immediately introduced into a hand&s;ome draw|ing room, where a large party was a&s;&s;embled; among which was a boy about the age of ma&s;ter <HI>Edward,</HI> with whom he and his brother &s;oon quitted the apartmant, and retired to the dining parlour, where I was produced, with great prai&s;es of my merit. But a difficulty now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, as I could not &s;pin upon the carpet. This therefore, they agreed to turn back and without
<PB N="108" REF="021188_0104_0FB29E2656681580">
con&s;idering the holes my peg would make in the floor, they began to &s;pin me by turns, and con|tinued to entertain them&s;elves, until a footman came to lay the cloth for dinner. He blamed the young gentlemen for the liberty they had taken, and &s;aid, his mi&s;tre&s;s would be much di&s;|plea&s;ed, and in&s;i&s;ted upon their finding a more proper place for their amu&s;ement. After de|bating the matter &s;ome time, they agreed to ad|journ to the library; where, as &s;oon as they ar|rived, I was laid on a writing de&s;k, as their at|tention was engaged by the pictures of a folio, which was open on a table. The plea&s;ure they found in this examination made them forget me; and when they were &s;ummoned to attend the company, they, in their ha&s;te, left me behind; and the lei&s;ure I there enjoyed, &s;ugge&s;ted the idea of communicating an account of my&s;elf to the world. Whether the recital will afford any &s;atisfaction to the youthful readers, I mu&s;t leave with them to determine.</P>
