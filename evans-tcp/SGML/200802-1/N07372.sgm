<BIBL>PSALM CXLVII. v. 14.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>He maketh Peace in thy Borders, and filleth Thee with the Flower of Wheat.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A LONG, dangerous, and expen&s;ive War now clo&s;es with an honorable Peace; and for this we are ordered to a mo&s;t rea&s;onable, pious Duty, to return our &s;olemn Thanks to that great and good GOD, who hath taught our Hands to war and our Fin|gers to fight &s;o very &s;ucce&s;sfully. 'Tis this at la&s;t that com|pletes our Joy by &s;topping the further Progre&s;s of War with her cruel and in&s;eparable Attendants, Mi&s;ery and Horror: For Conquerors them&s;elves mu&s;t own it is ever accompanied by tho&s;e gha&s;tly Furies: The fine&s;t and mo&s;t brilliant Victories co&s;t many Tears: The mo&s;t blooming and verdant Laurels are ever &s;tain'd with Blood, and even in the Day of Triumph the Cries of Bitterne&s;s and Sorrow mix them&s;elves with the Shouts of Joy and Gladne&s;s. We may with Truth &s;ay, we have had enough of Victory, we have had enough of military Glory, and the Trophies and the Spoils of War; or rather, enough of human Blood has been pour'd upon the Earth even to glut
<PB N="6" REF="009409_0005_0F74046047CEC780">
the ravenous Jaws of Death: We have had enough of that Succe&s;s which cannot be enjoy'd but at the Expence of the Lives of our Fellow-Creatures, and tho&s;e oft the brave&s;t and the be&s;t of Men. Therefore let us with Hearts unfeign'd and Gratitude &s;incere return our Thanks to Almighty GOD for re|&s;toring Peace to the&s;e Dominions, Security to Trade and Com|merce, and Stability to our Religion and Church.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not here take up your time in giving you a Detail of the many and great Advantages we have gain'd, the important Acqui&s;itions made, or the &s;ignal Victories obtain'd by Sea and Land in the Cour&s;e of this War, tho' &s;uch indeed might be entertaining, and agreable enough, but better &s;een in the An|nals of the times, and I think with much more propriety read there than heard here. I &s;hall therefore beg your Attention to what more nearly concerns you not only as a Community but as Individuals, and while I endeavour to &s;hew you what good U&s;e you &s;hou'd make of the&s;e peaceable Times, I conceive I &s;hall be offering &s;ome Things worthy your Con&s;ideration and which, if regarded, may prove of &s;olid and la&s;ting Benefit to you all.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Thing that will naturally pre&s;ent it&s;elf to us in our reflecting upon the happy Con&s;equences re&s;ulting from the Ble&s;&s;ing now given us, is the Security of our Civil Liberty, a Happine&s;s we ju&s;tly glory in; For Britons have pre&s;erv'd it pure and uncorrupted thro' all the Struggles of Ambition and the mo&s;t dangerous Attacks of Power: They have &s;et the World a fair Example that the highe&s;t Ambition of Princes &s;hou'd be
<PB N="7" REF="009409_0006_0F740460E03DF3B8">
to govern a free People, and that no People can be great or happy but &s;uch as are &s;o; whil&s;t other Nations have bow'd their Necks to the Yoke of Power and have ba&s;ely given up this indi&s;putable Right of Man deriv'd to Him from the fir&s;t Law of Nature, and daily feel that Mi&s;ery, which ever waits on Slaves. Oh Liberty! Thou art the Author of every good and perfect Gift, the inexhau&s;tible Fountain, from whence all Ble&s;&s;ings flow. Without Thee, what avails the Sweetne&s;s of Climate, or the mo&s;t delightful Situation in the World? what avail all the Riches of Nature, the various Production of the Earth, the Mine bringing forth a thou&s;and Trea&s;ures, the Olive and the Vine blooming upon the Mountains, if Tyranny u&s;urps the happy Plains, and proud Oppre&s;&s;ion deforms the gay-&s;miling face of Nature.</P>
<P>Here the feeling Heart will naturally reflect on and lament the Fate of tho&s;e who are doom'd to Slavery, eternal Slavery. Unhappy Creatures de&s;tin'd to &s;ubmit to it, and perhaps no le&s;s &s;o are tho&s;e Countries which are oblig'd to practi&s;e it! Re&s;pecting this particular, and the manner in which it is Here conducted, it may be &s;aid it lo&s;es much of it's Horror, when compar'd with that of other Places. This perhaps is true, and I am likewi&s;e fully per&s;uaded, that in &s;ome of tho&s;e Families which properly re&s;pect Humanity, the State of Servitude ap|proaches to the Condition of an ea&s;y Dependance, and thro' the Con&s;ideration and mildne&s;s of the Ma&s;ter the very Name of Slave is oft forgotten. But of the&s;e how few! Whil&s;t the gra&s;ping Avarice of &s;ome, the unfeeling hard-heartedne&s;s, the very mon&s;trous Di&s;po&s;ition of others, which &s;eems to delight
<PB N="8" REF="009409_0007_0F7404618DB48F68">
in acts of Cruelty, are known to be exerci&s;ed daily in producing &s;uch Scenes of Mi&s;ery and Wretchedne&s;s, as cannot but be in the highe&s;t Degree &s;hocking to tho&s;e, who know how to think properly of the Condition of Human Nature.</P>
<P>But to return from this Digre&s;&s;ion. Amiable as Liberty is, we mu&s;t not per&s;ue it with blind Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and ungovern'd Zeal: We ought ever to remember, that this very precious Liberty is no other way to be &s;ecur'd to us, but by a dutiful Obedience to the Laws of our Country, and tho&s;e our Supe|riors, who have the Care of them. It is Folly, nay it is mad|ne&s;s to &s;uppo&s;e that that is true Liberty, which allows Men to act as they plea&s;e, ju&s;t as their inflam'd Brains, or wild Ima|gination may urge them on: For &s;oon, full &s;oon by this means Liberty and public Safety wou'd become Enemies to each other, and fall together. When Liberty becomes &s;o licentious, as to be free from the Check and Controul of ju&s;t Laws, when it tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the Bounds pre&s;crib'd by Nature, numerous and tho&s;e the wor&s;t of Evils will immediately follow: Thus the River, which whil&s;t confin'd in its proper Channel, carried Riches and Plenteou&s;ne&s;s along with it, gladdening the Lands it flow'd thro'; when it has bur&s;t thro' it's Barrier and over|flow'd it's Banks, brings Terror and De&s;olation, the produce of the Earth, Cattle and Men are &s;wept away, and lo&s;t in the De|luge of it's Waters. Exactly &s;imilar is the Ca&s;e, when Laws have not their proper Cour&s;e, or not obey'd, as they ought to be, an Evil which tho' free Governments may be the apte&s;t to fall into, is &s;o great a one, that every true Friend to Liberty wou'd &s;tudy to prevent it; for, as it has been well ob&s;erv'd,
<PB N="9" REF="009409_0008_0F740462386D86B0">
there is no greater Tyranny upon the Face of the Earth, than that, where tho&s;e who &s;hou'd obey, are become our Ma&s;ters: So very nece&s;&s;ary is it that we &s;hou'd faithfully adhere to that Principle I mention'd a little before, that we &s;hou'd always be ready and willing to pay a cheerful Obedience to the Laws of our Country, to the King, and all that are put in Authority under Him, as this is not only acting according to the Precepts of our holy Religion, but the only way to &s;ecure to us the Ble&s;&s;ings we are now &s;o thankful for, and which you wou'd do well &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>In Re&s;pect of our private Conduct, our ju&s;t Sen&s;e of the many and various good Things of this Life which we enjoy, will be&s;t appear in the U&s;e we &s;hall make of them. In Con&s;equence of a good Peace may naturally be expected a greater Plenty of every thing, and if you apply your Affluence and Abundance to the Purpo&s;es Providence de&s;ign'd, they become real Ble&s;&s;ings. Rea&s;on in this Ca&s;e evidently points out to you, that you ought to have your Hearts open to acts of Charity and Humanity, and to hold in the greate&s;t Abhorrence &s;ordid Avarice. Above all things, not only that you may have it in your Power to do good to others, but on your own account, you &s;hou'd be &s;ober and moderate in your Plea&s;ures, not di&s;&s;olving in Luxury and Exce&s;s, things &s;o extremely prejudicial to your own Health and Fortune, and which will infallibly involve your Families in Hard&s;hips and Misfortunes. And may it not here be a&s;k'd, is there not already too great a Tendency among&s;t us to Ex|travagance and Luxury? Some time ago was it not ju&s;tly ob|&s;erv'd
<PB N="10" REF="009409_0009_0F7404633680BA70">
to you, and this by the Highe&s;t Authority here, that &s;ome of the Evils this Country labours under, were to be im|puted to Exce&s;&s;es of this Nature? Suppo&s;ing the common Articles of dome&s;tic Expen&s;e are not carried too far, why are you beholden to our Mother-Country for &s;o many Things you wou'd do very well without, which the in&s;ignificant Pride of Dre&s;s, the empty Ambition of gaudy Furniture, or a &s;plendid Equipage lead you into, and which mo&s;t undoubtedly &s;erve more for O&s;tentation and Parade, than any real U&s;e or valuable Purpo&s;e in Life. You may imitate other Countries in their Virtues, if they have any, as fa&s;t as you plea&s;e, but believe me, you imitate them too &s;oon, much too &s;oon in their Vices. But what can be &s;aid in Defen&s;e of that prevailing Pa&s;&s;ion and Ta&s;te for Gaming? Racing, Cards, Dice and all &s;uch Diver|&s;ions, where they are per&s;u'd with that Eagerne&s;s as a Bu&s;ine&s;s or Occupation, have that fatal Tendency, that they never will permit that Country long to maintain the Character of a well moraliz'd People. If we con&s;ider the great Lo&s;s of Time, Money, and that Di&s;inclination to Bu&s;ine&s;s, which the&s;e Things occa&s;ion, how many good Rea&s;ons may be urg'd, why it is much to be wi&s;h'd that &s;everal of the&s;e idle Amu&s;ements were either unknown among&s;t us, or immediately vani&s;h'd from all Families, that are de&s;irous to appear Examples of Sobriety, and Moderation? Our great and good Forefathers liv'd without Them, and I can &s;ee no Rea&s;on, no good Rea&s;on at lea&s;t, why we their Po&s;terity might not do &s;o too, if we pleas'd. Many u&s;eful Arts in former Days were taken in Hand, and executed by both the Sexes, which now are almo&s;t entirely laid a&s;ide, and neglected by the one, and are ab&s;olutely forgot by, and
<PB N="11" REF="009409_0010_0F7404640206EBC0">
unknown to the other. I cou'd &s;ay much more to this Sub|ject, but that has been &s;aid, may appear to &s;ome full enough, and therefore I &s;hall proceed to another particular univer&s;ally acknowleg'd of the highe&s;t Importance, and I hope that what I &s;hall here advance will be receiv'd with Candour and Good-Nature, when it proceeds from no other Principle than a De&s;ire to amend That which &s;eems to require it, and to offer &s;ome Hints which well improv'd, and made u&s;e of, might prove of &s;ingular Service, and Advantage.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay you all know, and even feel the Nece&s;&s;ity of a good Education, and I imagine wou'd look upon it as no &s;mall Degree of Felicity, if you cou'd be &s;ure of making your Sons hereafter in Life &s;erviceable to your Country, u&s;eful to their own Families, and happy in Them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It &s;hou'd ever be remember'd that the Children of the pre|&s;ent Generation will be the Men that are to govern in the next, and &s;uch as they are train'd up now, will they be afterwards throughout Life, when left to them&s;elves. The now full-grown, and exalted Oak, which has always undeviating ri&s;en in Rectitude, is not to be forc'd from it's Uprightne&s;s by Violence very cogent and oppre&s;&s;ive; and likewi&s;e fruitle&s;s wou'd be the Attempt to unbend the &s;ame from that Crookedne&s;s, and Perver&s;ene&s;s it was fix'd in, ever &s;ince it was a tender Plant. A Circum&s;tance which makes it of the utmo&s;t Importance in every Sen&s;e both with Regard to the Public and Private In|tere&s;t, in what manner Youth is prepar'd to appear hereafter on the Stage of Life. In re&s;pect of the pre&s;ent Method of
<PB N="12" REF="009409_0011_0F740464B360ADF0">
Education per&s;u'd by far the greater Part among&s;t us, will it not appear to a thoughtful Per&s;on likely to take an unhappy Turn? The Attention of the Generality &s;eems particularly di|rected to tho&s;e parts of u&s;eful Knowledge, as they may be call'd, which will turn out to &s;ome immediate Account of Profit, and Advantage, which will make &s;ome quick Return of a &s;olid, lucrative Nature to their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, whil&s;t tho&s;e more truly u&s;eful Arts, and valuable Studies, which poli&s;h, and humanize Mankind, which rai&s;e the Genius, and which mend the Heart, which in&s;pire the noble Principles of Probity and Honour, which in &s;hort lay the Foundation of every private, and public Virtue, whil&s;t the&s;e, I &s;ay, lie neglected and overlook'd, as altogether unnece&s;&s;ary to a Youth's future Advancement, and Succe&s;s in the World. In&s;tead of this what is there &s;ub&s;tituted? Perhaps I am not far from the Truth, as it is not my De&s;ign to be &s;o, when I ob&s;erve that a little Knowledge in Figures and Accounts, a Smattering of the Mathematics, and a tolerable Acquaintance with the peculiar Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Country, make up the Sum total of the Learning of I know not how many. On &s;uch Things as the&s;e then your Minds mu&s;t always be em|ploy'd, or Time will hang extremely heavy on your hands, except when you are engag'd in &s;ome of tho&s;e Amu&s;ements and Di|ver&s;ions I have before mention'd (for tho' it is a &s;trange Con|nexion, that of a Per&s;uit after Money and Plea&s;ure, yet &s;uch is frequently the Ca&s;e) and this in &s;uch a manner, as &s;hall leave no Room (if you had the Di&s;po&s;ition) for any Improvement in any thing more commendable. In con&s;equence of all this your Care of your De&s;cendants mu&s;t be expected to be &s;imilar, and proportionably Defective; and accordingly we may ob&s;erve
<PB N="13" REF="009409_0012_0F7404665C51C180">
you are much more intent upon cultivating a few dirty Acres of Land, than the improving and poli&s;hing a Youth's mind, which left wild to it&s;elf, like the Woods we live in, is &s;eldom &s;een to produce any thing fair, lovely, or elegant. For is it an uncommon thing, (I heartily wi&s;h it was &s;o) to &s;ee the hope|ful Heir to a large E&s;tate brought up in a manner by no means an&s;werable to it, and who, when in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, either knowing not how to u&s;e it very &s;tupidly hoards it up, or profu&s;ely &s;quanders it away, without Judgement, Ta&s;te, or Reputation.</P>
<P>'Tis mo&s;t certain, that in the Trea&s;ures of Ancient Learning are to be &s;ought for all tho&s;e excellent Precepts, which improve and mend the Heart, which as it is the &s;ource of every Virtue and every Vice cannot be tended with too much De|ligence and Care, 'tis I &s;ay, in tho&s;e valuable Stores of Knowlege, where we are to receive &s;uch Rules, as &s;hall lay the Pa&s;&s;ions un|der the Re&s;traint of ju&s;t Laws, that &s;hall teach us each virtuous and generous Principle of Ju&s;tice, Integrity, and Honor; 'Tis there, and there only we &s;hall meet with painted in the livelie&s;t Colors the mo&s;t &s;hining Examples of the brave&s;t and the be&s;t of Men, not to be gaz'd at, but to be imitated: 'Tis from the Contemplation of tho&s;e amiable Pictures, 'tis by the lovely Ideas we draw in from their Excellence, that we may learn to regulate and form our Manners, learn to tran&s;plant into our own Brea&s;ts their bright Perfections, till we &s;hine like Them. Upon this noble and broad Foundation let us erect the glorious Super&s;tructure of our Holy Religion, whence we &s;hall &s;ee ari&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="009409_0013_0F740467044EA170">
that fair Edifice at once complete in every Point of Utility and Convenience, and adorn'd with all the Elegance and Simplicity of Nature; which at once &s;hall &s;tand firm and un&s;haken on its proper Ba&s;is, and the Ornament and Honor of all the Country round.</P>
<P>After having thus dwelt more largely, than I at fir&s;t intended, on the foregoing Subject, I &s;hall add the following Exhorta|tion, which tho' it only touches upon tho&s;e Particulars, which might very properly be drawn out into a greater Length, yet may have a good Effect, if duly attended to and regarded.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t unfeeling, adamantine Heart cannot but &s;well with Thanks and Prai&s;e to Almighty GOD for the&s;e invaluable Ble&s;&s;ings, the Peace and Security we now enjoy; but to te&s;tify properly this our Gratitude to the Supreme Being, let us all for the future (and this is the only way to do it) ob&s;erve the mo&s;t pious and religious Deportment, let us by the &s;tricte&s;t Regard to the Precepts of that Religion with which we are ble&s;&s;ed, the pure&s;t upon the Face of the Earth, be &s;o very pru|dent, and &s;o very circum&s;pect, that if po&s;&s;ible, we may never do ami&s;s: Thus we may hope to appear in the Pre&s;ence of Almighty GOD, not as the mo&s;t unworthy of his Creatures, upon whom he has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to pour down his Ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>Next to our thus con&s;cientiou&s;ly di&s;charging our Duty to GOD, let us &s;tudy to expre&s;s our Loyalty, Affection, and Fi|delity to the be&s;t and mo&s;t beneficent King by a &s;teady and due Obedience to his Laws, and Government, for this is the only

kind Return we can make him, and this may much contribute towards making him &s;it ea&s;y, and happy on the Throne of his Ance&s;tors, and &s;weeten the Toils and Pains of Royalty. As it will not a little &s;erve to this good Purpo&s;e, let every one as much as lies in his Power di&s;courage, and di&s;countenance every in&s;olent Attempt to di&s;turb the public Tranquillity, curb every Appearance of Di&s;order and Di&s;content, and promote by all po&s;&s;ible means the utmo&s;t Peace, Friend&s;hip, and Brotherly Love among&s;t one another.</P>
<P>If we entertain a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of our Happine&s;s at this Time, we &s;hall &s;hew our Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction in it with Propriety and Decency; Let us therefore by no means indulge in wild Intemperance, Riot, or Luxury, but expre&s;s a rational and be|coming Joy for our pre&s;ent Welfare and Pro&s;perity, and &s;tudy to render permanent the ine&s;timable Benefits re&s;ulting from &s;o glorious a Peace.</P>
<P>On this happy and joyful Occa&s;ion I think the mo&s;t Scrupu|lous Hearer cannot be offended, that I conclude in a manner &s;omewhat unu&s;ual indeed, yet I hope not improper or un&s;uit|able tho' in the Language of Poetry,
