<P>JERUSALEM was not only the &s;eat of government for the Commonwealth of I&s;rael, but al&s;o of the church of GOD. On this favoured &s;pot &s;tood the National Temple, whither the tribes of the LORD went up to pray and prai&s;e. The happine&s;s of the nation was &s;o connected with the pro&s;perity of the church, that whatever touched the one, would af|fect the other. It was pre&s;umed, therefore, that He who had an intelligent regard for the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of civil &s;ociety, would di&s;cover it by a &s;uit|able affection for the hou&s;e and wor&s;hip of GOD.</P>
<P>THIS p&s;alm &s;eems to have been compo&s;ed to be &s;ung at the general national fe&s;tival, when the a&s;&s;embled tribes had opportunity to meet each other with mutual congratulations, and unite together in devoutly wor|&s;hipping their common Creator: And by an ea&s;y transfer of the &s;entiments it contains to the occa&s;ion of our pre&s;ent meeting, it may afford in&s;truction both

u&s;eful and entertaining. For the church of CHRIST is called, The Jeru&s;alem that is above.</P>
<P>WE <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">embled, my re&s;pected auditory, for the purpo&s;e of &s;olemnly &s;eparating and &s;etting apart a hou&s;e erected for religious wor&s;hip; and of dedicating of it unto GOD. May it never be profaned by impie|ty, nor di&s;honored by improper u&s;es! May it be for|ever &s;acred to GOD and his &s;ervice! Here, may thy wor&s;hip ari&s;e as incen&s;e, and the offerings of thy peo|ple be an acceptable memorial before thee!</P>
<P>THE duties of piety and devotion are the mo&s;t im|portant part of the &s;ervice which is due from man to his Maker. In vain do we offer GOD the outward form without the homage of the heart! And in vain do we profe&s;s to have devotion, unle&s;s we have clean hands and a pure heart, moral virtue and chri&s;tian charity! The&s;e are &s;entiments which &s;hould always accompany us to the hou&s;e of GOD.</P>
<P>MAY they impre&s;s our minds while we proceed to con&s;ider this congratulatory hymn, and apply it to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>"<HI>I WAS glad when they &s;aid unto me, let us go into the hou&s;e of the</HI> LORD. <HI>Our feet &s;hall &s;tand within thy gates, O Jeru&s;alem,</HI> Jeru&s;alem is builded as a city that is compact together: Whither the tribes of the LORD go up, the tribes of the LORD unto the te&s;timony of I&s;rael, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD. For there are &s;et thrones of judgment; the thrones of the hou&s;e of David."</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="028839_0004_0FDDD8812F257158">WITH inimitable melody he repre&s;ents them as ex|pre&s;&s;ing, in &s;emichoir, the plea&s;ure they received by the invitations to go up to the temple, echoed by the full choir "<HI>Our feet &s;hall &s;tand</HI>&mdash;;" becau&s;e the wor&s;hip and order of it was fair as the moon, clear as the &s;un; and the workman&s;hip of it was as beautiful as Tirzah, and comely as Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>MANY of them came from a di&s;tance. They did not decline the fatigues that mu&s;t attend going there. But urged on by the love they felt for the hou&s;e and wor&s;hip of GOD, they rejoiced in the opportunity of at|tending there. They celebrate the uniformity and ele|gance of the city, which added beauty to the temple, while that in turn contributed much to ornament the city.</P>
<P>IT was on this account that they were encouraged to go from &s;trength to &s;trength. Here they beheld every thing decent and in order. Here they con&s;ult togeth|er the oracles of GOD. They wor&s;hip Him together. And as the order and arrangement of the building, formed a faint emblem of the glory and magnificence of the great Builder of the temple above, &s;o it had a good effect on the mind.</P>
<P>IT was matter of joy too that this &s;eat of wor&s;hip was al&s;o the &s;eat of ju&s;tice and of judgment, where their civil rights and eccle&s;ia&s;tical concerns were patronized and &s;ecured. Though religion needs not the aid of civil government to defend, much le&s;s to prove its truth, yet government needs the aid of religion to &s;up|port it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="028839_0005_0FDDD882B3911C60">FEEBLE indeed were the efforts of law in the hand of civil officers to control the unruly pa&s;&s;ions of men, were they not re&s;trained by the more awful &s;anctions of religion. Happy the &s;tate where the current of ju&s;tice runs pure by the temple of GOD! Where religion ren|ders all in authority a terrror to evil doers!</P>
<P>THE favourable a&s;pect of morality and religion on the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of &s;ociety cannot be doubt|ed. Indeed, it is a well known fact, that tho&s;e places are more opulent and happy where publick wor&s;hip is made re&s;pectable, by &s;uitable hou&s;es dedicated to GOD, and His wor&s;hip &s;teadily &s;upported, than where they are neglected. The expen&s;e notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>RELIGIOUS e&s;tabli&s;hments are the ju&s;t abhorrence of freemen, both as a violation of the rights of con&s;cience, and as the bane of pure religion, by introducing an ab|horrent &s;y&s;tem of corruption, prie&s;tcraft and &s;tate poli|cy: But the experience of mankind envinces the im|portance of upholding religious in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>THE air of re&s;pectability which elegant churches give a town, tends to its pro&s;perity and happine&s;s, by inviting &s;ettlers, by giving a &s;pring to indu&s;try, and by promoting order. The re&s;pect which religion ac|quires by an open, fair and liberal &s;upport, has a great influence on the welfare of &s;ociety, by refining the &s;en|timents and poli&s;hing the manners of men. The ef|fect on the education of youth, and in forming the char|acter of the ri&s;ing generation, is un&s;peakably great. And while the&s;e plea&s;ing effects are produced on the face of the world, the way is prepared for the growth
<PB N="7" REF="028839_0006_0FDDD886C637B490">
of real virtue and piety in the heart, which are the final objects of all religious in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>THESE things are, in their operation, promotive of the be&s;t intere&s;ts of mankind on earth. They are at the &s;ame time, by their in&s;tructive and moral tendency, training up men for higher &s;cenes of nobler joys.&mdash;Thus the in&s;titutions of religion, by qualifying men to be citizens on earth and ornaments in the church, are preparing them to receive, as the gift of GOD'S grace, the rank of citizen&s;hip in heaven, and to &s;hine as &s;tars in the firmament above.</P>
<P>"<HI>PRAY for the peace of Jeru&s;alem; they &s;hall pro&s;per that love thee.</HI>" Since &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings attend the or|dinances of religion, how natural to call on the church to pray for the city which contained them, e&s;pecially when both their outward pro&s;perity, and inward and &s;piritual comfort depend on the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD.</P>
<P>THE welfare of men on earth depends &s;o much on the pre&s;ervation of order, that to pray and exert our|&s;elves for the pro&s;perity of Zion, is an evidence of our regard for the good of the world, and is a mean of en|crea&s;ing our attachment to it. With this publick and generous &s;pirit, chri&s;tianity in&s;pires its true &s;ubjects, and is it&s;elf the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible example of it, in the a&s;toni&s;hing act of its Author and Founder, who died a martyr to the truth and importance of our &s;ubject.</P>
<P>SO true is the &s;aying, that "godline&s;s is profitable to the life that now is," that he who exerts him&s;elf for
<PB N="8" REF="028839_0007_0FDDD887EF12FAC8">
the honour and intere&s;t of religious in&s;titutions, is con|&s;ulting his own good and pro&s;perity. By a wi&s;e con|&s;titution of things, it is &s;o ordered, that he who ca&s;ts his bread on the waters &s;hall receive again after many days.</P>
<P>HE will find his account in all his deeds of charity or of publick utility, in one way or another. Whate|ver &s;ervice he renders the church of GOD, he thereby lays up in &s;tore a good foundation for him&s;elf or his children. Though he &s;hould experience no particular marks of pro&s;perity him&s;elf, he has the con&s;olation of reflecting that he has laid the foundation for it in po&s;|terity, by the order he has contributed to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>THE P&s;almi&s;t thought it a &s;ufficient rea&s;on to wi&s;h peace and pro&s;perity to Jeru&s;alem, becau&s;e that city contained the temple of GOD. "<HI>Peace be within thy walls.</HI>"&mdash;It is not uncommon for man to envy the pro&s;|perity of the opulent and the condition of publick char|acters. But a better &s;pirit is inculcated in the hou&s;e of GOD; even to pray for them. Of how much con&s;e|quence, then, to their comfort and tranquillity, that they &s;hould give publick countenance and &s;anction to the in&s;titution of wor&s;hip?</P>
<P>"<HI>FOR my brethren and companions' &s;ake, I will now &s;ay, peace be within thee.</HI>" The intere&s;ts our friends have in the pro&s;perity of the church &s;hould engage our at|tention to it. Their happine&s;s, as ours, depends on the pre&s;ervation and growth of religion. But how is this to be effected but by keeping up religious in|&s;titutions.</P>
<P>WERE religion left to a &s;olitary retreat without hou&s;|es or forms of wor&s;hip, how would the &s;pirit of it die
<PB N="9" REF="028839_0008_0FDDD88C1F3793C0">
away for want of public countenance; and with the failure of this, how would iniquity and every evil work abound? But there are many who wi&s;h well, but can do but little towards the &s;upport of religion. Tho&s;e may be among the &s;alt of the earth, by who&s;e moral influ|ence the &s;y&s;tem is pre&s;erved. "<HI>For their &s;akes</HI>" &s;hould we cultivate a public &s;pirit, and &s;eek the good of the church.</P>
<P>"<HI>BECAUSE of the hou&s;e of the</HI> LORD <HI>our</HI> GOD, <HI>I will &s;eek thy good.</HI>" To prayers in the church, every good man will add his endeavors to promote the welfare of the State, and &s;o much the more as they enjoy protection from it, and freedom in the exerci&s;e of religion.</P>
<P>IT is the wi&s;dom of the &s;tate to hold out public countenance and encouragement to religion, not by re|ligious e&s;tabli&s;hments in favor of one and to oppre&s;s another &s;ect; but by extending equal patronage to all literary and religious in&s;titutions, and by the appoint|ment of friends to religion to public offices. Then the influence would be reciprocal. The &s;tate would derive a &s;alutary influence from the temple, and that in turn, the countenance of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE &s;anctions or civil law can reach no further than the outward act, and that only as di&s;covered and &s;upport|ed by legal evidence; but tho&s;e of religion extend to the heart, take hold of the con&s;cience, and &s;trike at the root of wickedne&s;s. While the one can only lop off the branches within its reach, the other is tearing up the tree by the roots. Judge then whether the in&s;titutions of religion de&s;erve not the countenance of every wi&s;e and judicious citizen.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="028839_0009_0FDDD88D476714A0">IN the application of the &s;ubject we are led to make the following reflections:</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is, that all good men will rejoice in the pro&s;perity of the chri&s;tian church: Yea, that all who con&s;ult the good of &s;ociety will pay re&s;pect to the in&s;ti|tution of public wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>INDEED, the p&s;almi&s;t intimates that the want of this &s;pirit of philanthropy is incon&s;i&s;tent with an hone&s;t and good heart; and therefore takes it for granted that all &s;uch would cultivate it. The more of this benevolent di&s;po&s;ition we po&s;&s;e&s;s, the more &s;hall we re&s;emble Him who is the &s;tandard of all perfection. In whatever brea&s;t this &s;pirit prevails, towards the church in general, there will be an attachment to the particular chri&s;tian &s;o|ciety with which we are connected; not to the exclu|&s;ion of any others from our charity; much le&s;s to their injury.</P>
<P>THE rational ends which men have in view in form|ing into di&s;tinct religious &s;ocieties are, the opportunity of wor&s;hipping GOD according to the dictates of their own con&s;ciences, and the convenience of attending an uniform mode of &s;ocial wor&s;hip with their families.&mdash;How important this is to the education of children and youth, let the experience of the world declare!</P>
<P>BUT in vain do men profe&s;s an attachment to &s;ocie|ty unle&s;s they are willing to exert the abilities which GOD hath given them to promote its welfare. Expen|&s;es nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e in erecting hou&s;es of wor&s;hip and upholding the &s;tated mini&s;try, which requires their u|nited
<PB N="11" REF="028839_0010_0FDDD88ECC126888">
exertion to defray, becau&s;e it is for common good. A moment's con&s;ideration will &s;how every wi&s;e man the nece&s;&s;ity of the former, and convince him of the pro|priety of the latter. It is a &s;entiment that meets the common ideas of ju&s;tice, that "the laborer is worthy of his hire;" and it is a &s;tatute of immutable obligation in the chri&s;tian kingdom, that&mdash;"they who preach the go&s;pel &s;hall live of the go&s;pel."&mdash;But I will not offend the under&s;tanding of an enlightened audience by dwell|ing on &s;o plain a ca&s;e.</P>
<P>ANOTHER &s;entiment ari&s;ing from the &s;ubject, is, that &s;ome re&s;pect is due to the con&s;truction of hou&s;es erected for the wor&s;hip of GOD.</P>
<P>GREAT and magnificent was the temple of the Jews at Jeru&s;alem, built under the direction of the great head of the church. Although this may not afford a &s;uitable model for the more &s;piritual in&s;titution of chri&s;t|ian wor&s;hip, yet it is pre&s;umable that a rational venera|tion for the Deity will lead to the be&s;towment of much labor and expen&s;e upon buildings dedicated to GOD. Will it be objected that GOD is not confined to the walls of hou&s;es, nor plea&s;ed with the elegance of build|ings or co&s;tly offerings&mdash;that all nature is his temple, and that he is wor&s;hipped through the va&s;t amplitude of &s;pace? Be it granted! yet though we cannot be profit|able to GOD, His wor&s;hip made re&s;pectable, may be &s;o to us. He is not confined to hou&s;es, but hou&s;es built for convenience of &s;ocial wor&s;hip are appropriat|ed to Him. And if we follow the allu&s;ion in the objec|tion, may we not a&s;k in turn&mdash;Why ought they not, in humble imitation of the &s;uperb &s;tructure of his univer|&s;al temple, to be the ma&s;ter &s;trokes of human ingenuity,
<PB N="12" REF="028839_0011_0FDDD89206507480">
the highe&s;t efforts of human &s;kill? At lea&s;t, fitne&s;s re|quires that the beauty and elegance of hou&s;es for wor&s;hip &s;hould ever corre&s;pond to the progre&s;s of wealth and refinement in &s;ociety, with which other buildings keep pace. Otherwi&s;e there would be a marked inattention to religious order; and the want of decent accommodations might be pleaded by peo|ple of ta&s;te for the neglect of public wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>HAPPILY, the people of this town can have no &s;uch apology for &s;uch neglect! Few towns, of its &s;ize, per|haps, none in the United States exceeds it in this re&s;|pect.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The new meeting hou&s;e in Providence, at the dedication of which this &s;ermon was al&s;o delivered, is 87 by 71 feet on the ground plat. That in Brookfield we&s;t-pa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;h, is 64 by 51, and con&s;idering its remotene&s;s from any great commercial town, mu&s;t be viewed as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a high degree of elegance.</NOTE> This &s;ociety finding their hou&s;e of wor&s;hip out of repair and not &s;ufficiently large to accommodate their growing numbers, conceived the bold de&s;ign of erecting another which will &s;tand as a la&s;ting monument of prai&s;e to the pre&s;ent generation. What &s;eemed to be wanting in ability has been &s;upplied by generous and harmonious exertions; and Divine Providence &s;miling on efforts &s;o laudable hath rendered them &s;ucce&s;sful. And we are this day called to felicitate you on the cheer|ful, but &s;erious occa&s;ion of dedicating to GOD the hou&s;e ye have builded for His name! May the &s;ame &s;pirit of concord and&punc; brotherly love, that have marked your proceedings in projecting and accompli&s;hing this no|ble edifice, continue among you and render you happy in the enjoyment of it!</P>
<P>A THIRD ob&s;ervation that re&s;ults from the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e, is the union of duty with plea&s;ure in attend|ing public wor&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="028839_0012_0FDDD89348764E38">IN vain are hou&s;es erected for this purpo&s;e, unle&s;s we have &s;ome plea&s;ure in hearing it &s;aid&mdash;"<HI>Let us go into the hou&s;e of the</HI> LORD," and our hearts re&s;pond&mdash;"<HI>My feet &s;hall &s;tand within thy gates, O Jeru&s;alem.</HI>" That we &s;hould wor&s;hip GOD together is a dictate of rea&s;on. What can be more fit and rea&s;onable than that beings con&s;tantly dependent on GOD &s;hould acknowledge this to Him; &s;hould thank Him for His favours; commit them&s;elves to His protection, and &s;eek His ble&s;&s;ing? This joint offering is nece&s;&s;ary in our &s;ocial &s;tate be|cau&s;e our wants are common, and &s;o are our ble&s;&s;ings; and this is a public and vi&s;ible mark of re&s;pect and reverence for the giver of every good gift.</P>
<P>BUT, be&s;ides tho&s;e outward expre&s;&s;ions of wor&s;hip and homage, the public in&s;titutions of religion afford a convenient opportunity of communicating u&s;eful in|&s;tructions to all, old and young. There are always to be found, in &s;ociety, many individuals who need the benefit of &s;uch communications from tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;i|ne&s;s is &s;tudy and improvement. How many are there who have neither time nor means for gaining this knowledge? And how much need have tho&s;e who po&s;|&s;e&s;s both to be quickened in the knowledge they have? What method &s;o &s;uitable to effect&punc; this as public ad|dre&s;&s;es to people congregated for that purpo&s;e, in ra|tional and well dige&s;ted di&s;cour&s;es on moral and reli|gious &s;ubjects? The benevolent de&s;ign of &s;uch in&s;titu|tions, and the rational ends of &s;uch public religious a&s;|&s;emblies, mu&s;t be a rea&s;on &s;ufficient to induce every well wi&s;her to the be&s;t intere&s;t of &s;ociety to give their exem|plary attendance, though it were only of human ap|pointment. But where to this motive, is added the
<PB N="14" REF="028839_0013_0FDDD894C582DBB0">
weight of Divine authority, how does the obligation encrea&s;e?</P>
<P>THE in&s;titution of &s;ocial wor&s;hip is coeval with &s;o|ciety it&s;elf, and has met the approving voice of men in all ages. Particular directions were given about it to the Jews. Solemn a&s;&s;emblies were continued under the go&s;pel; and the neglect of them was con&s;idered as apo&s;tacy from the faith. And to the pre&s;ervation of the&s;e may be a&s;cribed all the appearances of religion which we this day behold in the world. It requires no great penetration to di&s;cern, nor force of argument to prove, that without this method of pre&s;erving a remem|brance of the Deity in the world, and of cultivating on the mind a due reverence for Him, a general forgetful|ne&s;s of Him would en&s;ue. The feeble light of natural rea&s;on would &s;oon be clouded; and human nature un|der the weight of its own infirmities and degraded pa&s;|&s;ions would &s;oon degenerate into wildne&s;s and barbari&s;m.</P>
<P>HENCE among all civilized nations &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons for calling of the mind from the employments of this life have been ob&s;erved, and means u&s;ed for directing it to the concerns of another. Without the re&s;traints of re|ligion, what happine&s;s, yea, what &s;afety could be en|joyed in the world? Take away tho&s;e ties, and you let loo&s;e the whole army of the wretched and the de&s;perate upon the indu&s;trious, the affluent, and the happy; and open the door for violence to &s;talk at noon day, unawed by fear, and unre&s;trained by principle. To awaken the&s;e principles is the office of religion, and to keep a|live this re&s;traint is the tendency of public wor&s;hip. How can parents expect dutiful children, or ma&s;ters
<PB N="15" REF="028839_0014_0FDDD89897CD79B0">
faithful &s;ervants, unle&s;s they are &s;een openly and pub|licly to acknowledge, in a dutiful manner, the athor|ity of the great Parent and Ruler of men?</P>
<P>IT cannot be thought an improper u&s;e of the &s;ubject if I make u&s;e of the occa&s;ion to remind you of one cir|cum&s;tance that &s;hould ever attend your a&s;&s;embling here.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e is &s;uch as reflects honor upon you. Its walls are &s;acred by con&s;ecration and appointment only, your principal plea&s;ure therefore in coming hither &s;hould not be the gratification of the eye but the ex|erci&s;e of devotion in wor&s;hipping GOD in &s;pirit and in truth. May your delight in coming to this hou&s;e of the LORD be in communion with Him, and in hearing from Him out of His word! Mu&s;t not that heart be awfully engro&s;&s;ed with the vanities of this world that can take no plea&s;ure in tho&s;e things&mdash;that cannot &s;ep|erate the Sabbath from the common bu&s;ine&s;s of the week and devote it unto GOD?</P>
<P>IT is the character of the true wor&s;hippers that "<HI>they love the habitation of His hou&s;e and the place where His honor dwells.</HI>" Their hearts are there and where their hearts are they will endeavor to be al&s;o. They will con&s;cientiou&s;ly attend the appointed means of moral in&s;truction and religious improvement, with a view to benefit them&s;elves by "<HI>adding to their virtue, knowl|edge</HI>;" and for the benefit of others, by their counte|nance and example.</P>
<P>THIS whole a&s;&s;embly will permit me to recommend to them to pre&s;erve a due re&s;pect to religion.</P>

Let not your re&s;pect for &s;o u&s;eful an in&s;titution be le&s;&s;ened either by the raillery of tho&s;e who make a mock at &s;in, or by their example&mdash;who&s;e conduct ca&s;ts contempt on the in&s;titution of re|ligious wor&s;hip. But rather rejoice that there are &s;till &s;o many who favor the cau&s;e of Zion, and that, in this, you have the countenance of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t virtuous, who rejoice in hearing it &s;aid&mdash;"<HI>Let us go into the hou&s;e of the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P>THE things there di&s;cour&s;ed on carry in them an air of high importance. They claim to be from GOD. They have re&s;pect to the be&s;t intere&s;ts of men. They therefore, demand the attention even of the infidel him|&s;elf, who can never di&s;prove their truth; and on account of their great public utility claim attendance on the&s;e forms of in&s;truction. Shall the poli&s;hed period of the Orator be li&s;tened to with attention&mdash;&s;hall the artful mimicry of the actor excite alternate joy or grief or in|dignation, and &s;hall not the awful maje&s;ty of the go&s;|pel warm and affect the heart? What &s;ubjects &s;o de|&s;erving our attention as tho&s;e contained in the go&s;pel? They are of all others the mo&s;t intere&s;ting. They have an influence on our pre&s;ent condition; yea, their effects run parallel to our exi&s;tence. They open to us the great things of eternity. They treat of a day of final judgment&mdash;of worlds di&s;&s;olving with fervent heat&mdash;the univer&s;al wreck of nature&mdash;the joys of heaven, and the perdition of ungodly men.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="028839_0016_0FDDD89C351EE080">SUCH, and &s;o great are the &s;ubjects that chalange your attention in this hou&s;e! And it &s;hould be remembered that the day is approaching in which we mu&s;t all ren|der an account of our doings, how we have heard, and how we have improved the privileges we have enjoyed. To that momentous period may all our conduct bear reference; that from wor&s;hipping GOD in earthly tem|ples, we may, in His own time, be tran&s;lated to the temple above to join the general choir in a&s;cribing un|to Him, ble&s;&s;ing and honor and glory and power for|ever and ever. AMEN.</P>
